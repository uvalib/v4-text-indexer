      <field name="fulltext">[Troy Book] Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. PART I. PROLOGUE, BOOK I., AND BOOK II. PROLOGUE[MS. Cott. Augustus A. iv.]. O myghty Mars, that wyth thy sterne lyght In armys hast the power &amp; þe my?t, And named art from est til occident The myghty lorde, the god armypotent, That, wyth schynyng of thy stremes rede, By influence dost the brydel lede Of cheualry, as souereyn and patrown, Ful hoot and drye of complexioun, Irows and wood and malencolyk, And of nature brent and coleryk, Of colour schewyng lyche the fyry glede, Whos feerce lokes ben as ful of drede As the levene that aly?teth lowe Down by the skye from Iubiteris bowe! Thy stremes ben so passyng despitous, To loke vp-on, inly furious, And causer art wyth thy fery bemys Of werre and stryf in many sondry rewmys; Whos lordschype is most in Caprycorn, But in the bole is thy power lorn; And causer art of contek and of strif, Now, for the loue of Wlcanus wyf, Wyth whom whylom þou wer at meschef take, So helpe me now, only for hyr sake, And for the loue of thy Bellona, That wyth the dwellyth by-?ownd Cirrea In Lebye-londe vp-on the sondes rede; So be myn helpe in this grete nede To do socour my stile to directe, And of my penne the tracys to correcte, Whyche bareyn is of aureat lycour, But in thi grace I fynde som fauour For to conveye it wyth thyn influence, That stumbleth ay for faute of eloquence For to reherse or writen any word; Now help, o Mars, þat art of kny?thod lord, And hast of manhod the magnificence! And Othea, goddesse of prudence, This wirke texsplyte that ?e nat refuse, But maketh Clyo for to ben my muse, Wyth hir sustren that on Pernaso dwelle In Cirrea by Elicon the welle, Rennyng ful clere wyth st[r]emys cristallyn, And callyd is the welle Caballyn That sprang by touche of the Pegasee. And helpe also, O thou Calliope, That were moder vn-to Orpheus, Whos dites wern so mellodyus, That the werbles of his resownyng harpe Appese dyde the bitter wyrdys scharpe, Bothe of parchas and furies infernal, And Cerberus so cruel founde at al; He coyede also best[e], foule, and tree. Now of thy grace be helpyng vn-to me, And of thy golde dewe lat the lycour wete My dulled brest, that wyth thyn hony swete Sugrest tongis of rethoricyens, And maistresse art to Musicyens: Now be myn help tenlumyne with þis wirk, Whyche am beset with cloudis dym and dirk Of ygnoraunce, in makyng to procede, To be lusty to hem that schal it rede. Also in hert I am so ful of drede, Whan prudent lysters her-to schal take hede, That in makyng more skylle can than I, To whom I preie, ful benignely Of her goodnesse to haue compassioun Wher as I erre in my translacioun. For God I take hy?ly to wyttenesse That I this wirk of hertly lowe humblesse Toke vp-on me of entencioun, Devoyde of pride and presumpcioun, For to obeie with-oute variaunce My lordes byddyng fully and plesaunce, Whiche hath desire, sothly for to seyn, Of verray kny?thod to remembre ageyn The worthynes, ?if I schal nat lye, And the prowesse of olde chiualrie, By-cause he hath Ioye and gret deynte To rede in bokys of antiquite, To fyn only, vertu for to swe Be example of hem, and also for to eschewe The cursyd vice of slouthe and ydelnesse. So he enioyeth in vertuous besynesse, In al that longeth to manhood, dar I seyn, He besyeth euere, and ther-to is so fayn To hawnte his body in pleies marcyal, Thoru? excersice texclude slouthe at al, After the doctrine of Vygecius. Thus is he bothe manful and vertuous, More passyngly þan I can of hym write: I wante connyng his hi?e renoun tendite, So moche of manhood men may in hym sen. And for to witen whom I wolde mene, The eldest sone of the noble kyng, Henri the firþe, of kny?thood welle &amp; spryng, In whom is schewed of what stok he grewe; The rotys vertu þus can the frute renewe— In euery part the tarage is the same, Lyche his fader of maneris and of name, In sothefastnesse, this no tale is, Callid Henry ek, the worthy prynce of Walys, To whom schal longe by successioun For to gouerne Brutys Albyoun— Whyche me comaunded the drery pitus fate Of hem of Troye in englysche to translate, The sege also and the destruccioun, Lyche as the latyn maketh mencioun, For to compyle, and after Guydo make, So as I coude, and write it for his sake, By-cause he wolde that to hy?e and lowe The noble story openly wer knowe In oure tonge, aboute in euery age, And y-writen as wel in oure langage As in latyn and in frensche it is; That of the story þe trouth[e] we nat mys No more than doth eche other nacioun: This was the fyn of his entencioun. The whyche emprise anoon I gynne schal In his worschip for a memorial. And of the tyme to make mencioun, Whan I be-gan of this translacioun, It was the ?ere, sothely for to seyne, Fourtene complete of his fadris regne, The tyme of ?ere, schortly to conclude, Whan twenty grees was Phebus altitude, The hour whan he made his stedis drawe His rosen chariet lowe vnder the wawe To bathe his bemys in the wawy see, Tressed lyche gold, as men my?t[e] see, Passyng the bordure of oure occian; And Lucyna, of colour pale and wan, Hir cold arysyng in Octobre gan to dy?t, Tenchace the dirknesse of the frosty ny?t, In the myddes of the scorpion; And Esperus gan to wester dovn, To haste hir cours ageyn þe morwe graye; And Lucifer, the ny?t to voyde a-waye, Is callyd than, messanger of day, Our emysperye to put out of affraye Wyth bri?t kalendis of Phebus vpryst schene Out of the boundis Proserpina the quene, Wher Pluto dwelleth, the dirk[e] regioun, And the furies haue her mansioun; Til after sone Appollo lyst nat tarie To take soiour in the Sagittarie. Whyche tyme I gan the prolog to beholde Of Troye Boke, I-made be dayes olde, Wher was remembrid, of auctours vs be-forn, Of the dede the verreie trewe corn, So as it fil seuerid from the chaf; For in her honde they hilde for a staf The trouthe only, whyche thei han compyled Vn-to this fyn, that we wer nat begyled Of necligence thoru? for?etilnesse. The whiche serpent of age by processe Engendred is fersly vs tassaille, Of the trouth to make vs for to faille; For ner[e] writers, al wer out of mynde, Nat story only, but of nature and kynde The trewe knowyng schulde haue gon to wrak, And from science oure wittes put a-bak, Ne hadde oure elderis cerched out and sou?t The sothefast pyth, to ympe it in oure thou?t, Of thinges passed, for-dirked of her hewe, But thoru? writyng þei be refresched newe, Of oure auncetrys left to vs by-hynde; To make a merour only to oure mynde, To seen eche thing trewly as it was, More bry?t and clere þan in any glas. For ner her writyng nowe memorial, Dethe with his swerde schulde haue slay[e]n al, And y-dymmed with his sodeyn schoures The gret[e] prowes of thise conquerouris, And dirk[ed] eke the bri?tnesse of her fame, That schyneth ?et by report of her name; For vn-to vs her bokes represent With-out[e] feynynge þe weie þat þei went In her daies, whan thei wer alyue. Ageyn the trouthe who so euere stryue, Or counterplete or make any debate, The sothe is rad of hi?e or lowe estate, With-oute fauour, who so list take hede; For after deth clerkis lityl drede After desert for to bere witnesse, Nor of a tyraunt the trouthe to expresse, As men disserue, with-oute excepcioun; With lak or prys þei graunt hem her guerdoun. Wherfore me semeth euery maner man Schulde be his live in al that euer he can For vertu only eschewe to don amys; For after dethe, pleynly as it is, Clerkis wil write, and excepte noon, The pleyn[e] trouthe whan a man is goon. And by olde tyme for her writing trewe Thei cherisched werne of lordes þat hem knewe, And honoured gretly in tho dawes; For they enacted and gilte with her sawes Her hy?e renoun, her manhood and prowes, Her kny?thood eke and her worthynes, Her tryvmphes also and victories, Her famous conquest and her songe glories, From poynt to poynt rehersyng al þe trouthe, With-out[e] fraude, necligence, or slowthe Thei dide her labour and her besynesse. For elles certeyn the grete worthynesse Of her dedis hadde ben in veyn; For-dirked age elles wolde haue slayn By lenthe of ?eris þe noble worthi fame Of conquerours, and pleynly of her name For-dymmed eke the lettris aureat, And diffaced the palme laureat, Whiche þat þei wan by kny?thod in her dayes, Whos fretyng rust newe and newe assayes For to eclipse the honour and the glorie Of hi?e prowes, whiche clerkis in memorie Han trewly set thoru? diligent labour, And enlumyned with many corious flour Of rethorik, to make vs comprehende The trouthe of al, as it was in kende; Besied hem and feythfully travaylled Agayn al that þat age wolde assaylled, In her bokes euery thyng I-set, And with the keye of remembraunce it schet, Whiche lasteth ?et, and dureth euer in oon. Recorde of Thebes, þat was so long a-goon, Of whiche the rueyne and distruccioun ?e may beholde by gode inspeccioun, Crop and rote, ri?t as it was in dede, On Stace loketh, and þer ?e may it rede: How Polynece and Ethiocles, The brether two, ne kowde nat lyue in pees Til Thebes was brou?t vn-to ruyne, And al the maner how thei dide fyne; The deth also of worthi Tydeus, And how Edippus, with teris ful pytous, Wepte oute his eyne, and al his drery peyen, And how the smokys departid wer in tweyen, At the fest of fires funeral— In gret[e] Stace ?e may reden al— The fyre engendered by brotherly hatrede, Wher-thoru? þat deth was þe cruel mede, In verray sothe, of many worthi man, Lyche as myn auctor wel reherse can. Of Troye also, þat was of latter ?eres, By dillygence of cronyc[u]leris ?e may beholde in her wrytyng wel The stryfe, the werre, þe sege and euerydel, Ry?te as it was, so many ?eres passyd. Whos story ?it age hath nou?t diffaced, Nor cruel deth, with his mortal strokys; For maugre deth, ?e may beholde in bokys The story fully rehersed new and newe, And freschely floure of colour and of hewe From day to day, quyk &amp; no thyng feynt. For clerkys han this story so depeynt, That deth nor age, by no maner weye, The trouthe may not maken for to deye; Al-be that somme han the trouth[e] spared In her writyng, and pleynly not declared So as it was, nor tolde out feithfully, But it transformed in her poysy Thoru? veyn[e] fables, whiche of entencioun They han contreved by false transumpcioun To hyde trouthe falsely vnder cloude, And the sothe of malys for to schroude, As Omer dide, the whiche in his writyng I-feyned hathe ful many diuers thyng That neuer was, as Guydo lyst deuise, And thingys done in a-nother wyse He hathe transformed than þe trouþe was, And feyned falsly that goddis in þis caas The worthi Grekis holpen to werreye Ageyn Troyens, and howe þat þei wer seye Lyche lyfly men amonge hem day by day. And in his dites, þat wer so fresche &amp; gay With sugred wordes vnder hony soote, His galle is hidde lowe by the rote, That it may nou?t outewarde ben espied. And al for he with Grekis was allied, Ther-for he was to hem fauourable In myche thing, whiche is nou?t commendable Of hem þat lyst to demen after ry?t; For in makyng, loue hath lost his sy?t, To ?eue a pris wher noon is disserued, Cupide [is] blynde, whos domys ben obseruyd More after lust than after equite, Or after resoun how the trouth[e] be. For singulerte and false affeccioun Reyseth ful ofte by veyn[e] lausioun A man to worschip þat disserueth noon, By false reporte, and þus ful many oon With-oute merit hath his fame blowe— Wher of another þe renoun is vnknowe, That in armys hath meruelles wrou?t, Of whom par-aunter speketh no man nou?t— For fauour only is fostered more than ry?t, That hyndered hath many [a] worþi kny?t. Ovide also poetycally hath closyd Falshede with trouthe, þat makeþ men ennosed To whiche parte þat þei schal hem holde— His mysty speche so hard is to vnfolde, That it entriketh rederis that it se. Virgile also, for loue of Enee, In Eneydos rehersyth moche thyng, And was in party trewe of his writyng, Exsepte only that hym lyst som whyle The tracys folwe of Omeris stile; And of þis sege wrot eke Lollius, But to-forn alle, Dares Frigius Wrot moste trewly after þat he fonde, And Dytes eke of the Grekys lond. They were present and seyen euerydel, And as it fel they write trewe and wel, Eche in his tonge, by swyche consonaunce, That in her bokys was no variaunce, Whiche after wern vn-to Athenes brou?t, And by processe serched oute and sou?t By dillygence of oon Cornelius, Whyche was nevewe vn-to Salustius, Of Rome y-born, whiche dide his dever dewe Hem to translate, and the tracys sewe Of thise auctours by good avisement. But by-cause he sette [al] his entent For to be brefe, he lefte moche be-hynde Of the story, as men in bokys fynde, The firste mevyng and cause original, What was the gynnyng and rote in special, Ne how thei come by lond or by navie, How firste the sparke was kyndeled of envie A-twyxe Grekis and hem of Troye town, Of whiche Cornelye maketh no mencioun, Of her schippes nor of her vitaille, Nor how þat Grece is called Gret Ytaille, And the lasse, as bokys verrefye, Is named now the londe of Romanye, What noumbre of kynges and of dukes went Towarde the sege, al of oon assent, To wynne worschip &amp; for excersise Of armys only, in ful kny?tly wyse, Abydyng there to sen the versioun Of the cite and noble Yllyoun, Nor what the maner was of her armure, Nor at the sege who lengest dide endure, In what wyse eche other dide assaile, Nor how often thei metten in bataille, How mony worthi loste ther his lyf Thorou? olde hatrede wrou?t vp with newe st[r]if, Nor of her dethe he dateth nat the ?ere, For his writyng was particuler; With-oute frute he was compendious, This forseyde Romeyne, this Cornelius. Wherfore but late in comparisoun, Ther was an auctour of ful hi?e renoun That besied hym the tracys for to swe Of Dite and Dares, &amp; cast hym nat transmwe In al the story a worde as in sentence, But folweth hem by swyche convenience, That in effecte the substaunce is the same; And of Columpna Guydo was his name, Whiche had in writyng passyng excellence. For he enlvmyneth by crafte &amp; cadence This noble story with many fresche colour Of rethorik, and many riche flour Of eloquence to make it sownde bet He in the story hath ymped in and set, That in good feythe I trowe he hath no pere, To rekne alle þat write of this matere, As in his boke ?e may beholde and se. To whom I seie, knelyng on my knee: Laude and honour &amp; excellence of fame, O Guydo maister, be vn-to thi name, That excellest by souereinte of stile Alle that writen this mater to compile.

[Explicit prologus] BOOK I. Here bigynneth þe first boke of Troy: howe Esone resygned þe Crowne of Thesaly to Pellee. In þe regne &amp; lond of Thesalye, The whiche is now y-named Salonye, Ther was a kyng callyd Pelleus, Wys &amp; discrete &amp; also vertuous. The whiche, as Guydo lyst to specefie, Helde the lordschipe and the regallye Of this yle, as gouernour and kyng, Of whiche [þe] pepil, by record of writyng, Myrundones were called in tho dawes, Of whom Ovyde feyneth in his sawes, Methamorphoseos, where as ?e may rede How þis peple sothfastly in dede, So as myn auctor maketh mencioun, Were brou?t echon to destructioun With sodeyn tempest and with fery levene By the goddys sent down from þe heuene; For they of Ire, with-oute more offence, With the swerde &amp; stroke of pestilence On this yle whylom toke vengaunce, Lyche as it is putte in remembraunce. For this peple distroied were serteyn With thonder dent and with haiel and reyn, Ful unwarly, as Guydo list discryve; For ther was noon of hem lefte a-lyue In al the lond, that the violence Escape my?te of this pestilence Excepte the kyng, þe whiche went allone In-to a wode for to make his mone, Sool by hym silfe, al disconsolate, In a place that stood al discolat, Wher this kyng, rooming to and fro, Compleynynge ay of his fatal woo And the harmys þat he dide endure— Til at the laste, of caas or aventure, Besyde an holt he sawe wher stode a tre Of ful gret he?t and large of quantite, Holwe by the rote, as he kowde knowe, Wher as he sawe, by the erthe lowe, Of amptis crepe passyng gret plente, With whiche sy?te he felle dovn on his kne And made his preyer in his paynym wyse To the goddes with humble sacrifyse, Vp-on his wo and gret aduersite Only of mercy for to haue pyte, To turne thise amptis in-to forme of man. Thus gan he praye, with colour pale and wan, His lond tenhabite whiche stondeth disolat, And he alone, awaped and amaat, Comfortles of any creature, Hym to releue of that he dide endure. And, as Ovide maketh mencioun, That Iubiter herde his orisoun, And hath swiche rowth on hym at þe laste, That he anoon fulfilled his requeste, And of his my?te, whiche þat is devine, His grace he made from heuene for to schyne Benyngnely vn-to the erthe dovn, That a sodeyn transmutacioun Was made of amptis to forme of men anon, Whiche on her feet gonne stre?t to goon To Thesalye and salue ther the kyng, And lyche his liges token her dwellynge With-Inne a cite called tho Egee, As in Ovide ?e may beholde and see. The whiche people for her worthines, For her strenthe and gret[e] hardynes Myrundones so longe haue boor the name— As in the lyfe ?e reden may the same Of seynt Mathewe, how thei be called soo, Where the apostel so mochel hadde a-doo— Whiche for wisdam &amp; prudent aduertence, Besy labour and wilful dilligence, By for-seynge and discrecioun, As I suppose in myn opinioun, That this fable of amptis was contreved, Whiche by her wysdam han so myche achevid Thoru? her kny?thod, who so list to loke Her manly dedis thoru?-out Troie boke. In al meschef so wel thei han hem born That þei ful wysly prouided wern to-forn Or that it fil, bothe in werre and pees; For of no slouthe þei wer nat rek[e]les, But as the ampte teschewen ydelnesse In somer is so ful of besynesse— Or wynter com, to sauen hir fro colde Sche to-forne astored hath hir holde. But in this mater I holde no sermoun, I wil no longer make digressioun, Nor in fables no more as now soiourne, But there I lefte I wyl agayn retourne, Of Pelleus ferther to procede: Wiche kyng, forsothe, in story as I rede, And as myn auctor lysteth to endyte, Had a wyf that called was Tedite; Of whiche two, platly this no les, The manly man, the hardy Achilles, So as Guydo lesteth to termyne, Descended was, sothly as by lyne, Most renomed of manhood and of my?t Amonges Grekis, and the beste kny?t I-holde in sothe, thoru?-oute al her lond, In worthines preued of his hond. Whos cruelte Troiens sore abou?t, So passynge Merueilles in armys þer he wrou[?]t Duryng the sege, as ?e schal after lere, Paciently ?if ?e liste to here. But Pelleus, that I spak of a-forne, A brother hadde of o moder born, That hy?te Eson, so fer y-ronne in ?eris, That he of luste hath lost al his desyris, So fer he was y-cropen in-to age, Þat al his witte was turned to dotage; For bothe mynde and memorial For-dulled wern and dirked so at al, That verrailly his discrecioun Was hym birafte, in conclusioun. Wherfor the regne and lond of Thesalye, Crovne and septre with al the regalye, He hath resygned his brother for to queme, Estate royal and also diademe: By-cause he was croked, lame, &amp; blynde, And to gouerne loste boþe wit &amp; mynde, So febled was his celle retentif And fordirked his ymaginatif, That lost were bothe memorie and resoun; For whiche he made a resygnacion To his brother, next heyr by degre, And next allye of his affinite. But as somme auctours in her bokys seyn, To ?outhe he was restored new ageyn By crafte of Medee, the gret sorceresse, And renewed to his lustynesse; For with hyr herbes and hir pociouns, Sotyl wyrchyng[es] of confecciouns, By que[i]ntyse eke of hir instrumentys, With hir charmys and enchauntementys, Sche made a drynke, in bokys as is tolde, In whiche a ?erde that was drye and olde Withoute abod anoon as she it caste To blosme and budde it be-gan as faste, Turne grene and fresche for to beholde. And þoru? þis drinke sche hath fro ?eris olde Eson restored vn-to lusty age, And was of witte &amp; resoun eke as sage As euer he had his lyve ben a-forn. The whiche Eson, of his wyfe y-born, Hadde a son, and Iason was his name, In wirk of whom Nature nas to blame; For sche hir crafte, platly, and konnyng Spent vp-on hym hooly in wirkyng, Whan sche hym made, with hert[e], wil, &amp; þou?t, That of hir crafte behynde was ry?t nou?t. To rekne his schap and also his fayrnes, His strenthe, his bewte, and his lyflynes, His gentilles and wyse gouernaunce, How large he was, and of dalliaunce The most[e] goodly þat men koude knowe, In al his port bothe to hy?e and lowe; And with al þis avise and tretable— That of konnyng, God wot, I am nat able For to discryve his vertues by and by. For as myn auctor telleth feithefully, He was beloued so of old and ?onge, That thoru? þe londe is his honour spronge; But for þat he was but ?onge and sklender, Of age also inly grene and tender, He was committed to the gouernaille Of Pelleus, to whom with-oute faille In euery thyng he was as servisable, As diligent in chambre and at table, As euere was any childe or man Vn-to his lorde, in al þat euer he can Devise in herte of feithful obeyschaunce; So þat in chere nor in countenaunce, Inwarde in herte nor outwarde in schewyng, To his vncle ne was he nat grucchyng; Al-be he had holly in his hande The worthi kyngdam and þe riche lande Of this Iason, and the eritage, Only for he was to ?onge of age. Vn-to whom Pelleus dide his peyne Ageyn[es] herte falsely for to feyne, To schewen other þan he mente in herte, And kepte hym cloos, þat no þing hym asterte, Lyche an addre vnder flouris fayre, For to his herte his tonge was contrarie: Benyngne of speche, of menyng a serpente, For vnder colour was the tresoun blente, To schewe hym goodly vn-to his allye; But inwarde brent of hate and of envie The hoote fyre, &amp; ?it ther was no smeke, So couertly the malys was y-reke, That no man my?t as by sygne espie Toward Iason in herte he bare envie. And merveil noon, for hit was causeles, Saue he dradde þat he for his encres And for his manhood likly was tateyne For to succede in his faders reigne, Whiche Pelleus uniustly ocupieth; And day be day cast and fantasieth How his venym may be som pursute Vppon Iason be fully execute. Her-on he museth euery hour and tyme, As he þat dradde to sen an hasty pryme Folowen a chaunge, as it is wont to done, Sodeynly after a newe moone; He caste weyes and compasseth sore, And vnder colour alwey more and more His felle malys he gan to close and hide, Lyche a snake that is wont to glyde With his venym vnder fresche floures; And as the sonne is hoot a-fore þise schoures, So of envie hattere bran the glede. Vp-on a tyme he þou?te to procede To execute his menynge euery del, In porte a lambe, in herte a lyoun fel, Dowble as a tygre sli?ly to compasse, Galle in his breste and sugre in his face, That no man hath to hym suspecioun, Howe he purveieth the destruccioun Of his nevewe, and þat with-Inne a whyle, Pretendyng loue, al-be the fyn was gyle. His malys was I-schette so vnder keye, Þat his entent [ther] can no man be-wreye; It was conceled &amp; closed in secre, Vnder the lok of pryve Enmyte, And that in soth greued hym þe more: Vp-on hym silf þe anger frat so sore, Abydyng ay til [vn-to] his entent He fynde may leyser conuenient Vp-on his purpos platly to procede For to parforme it fully vp in dede. Wher-of Iason hath ful lytel rou?t— His vncle and he [ne] wer not in o thou?t— Of whos menyng was no conuenience, For malys was coupled with Innocence; And grownde of al, [so] as I can diuise, Was the Ethik of false couetise, Whiche fret so sore, falsly for to wynne, As crop and rote of euery sorowe and synne, And cause hath ben, syth[en] goo ful ?ore, That many a rewme hath a-bou?t ful sore The dredful venym of couetyse, allas! Lat hem be war, þat stonden in this caas, To thinke a-forne &amp; for to haue in mynde That al falshed draweth to an ende: For thou?e it bide and last a ?er or two, The ende in soth schal be sorwe and wo Of alle þat ben false and envious. Here-of no more, but forthe of Pelleus I wil ?ow telle, þat hath so long[e] sou?t Vp-on þis thing, til þer wer to hym brou?t Tidynges newe, &amp; þat so merveillous, That he astonyed was and alle his hous, Of a mervaille that new[e]ly was fal Besyde Troye, the plage oriental: How in Colchos, as the tydyng cam, With-Inne an Ile enclosed was a Ram Whiche bare his flees ful richely of golde; And for the richesse, it was kepte in holde With gret avis and gret[e] diligence, That no man my?t ther-to doon offence. And in this Ile ther was a gouernour, A noble kynge, a worthi weriour, That Cethes hi?t: wis, discret, and sage, Whiche was also [y-]ronne fer in age, That in his tyme, as bokys can deuise, Had vnder-fonged many gret emprise In pes and werre, &amp; moche worschip wonne; And he was sone also to the sonne, That ?af hym eure to honour to atteyne, So as poetis lusteth for to feyne. Touching his line, I leue as now þe grete; And of this Ram my purpos is tentrete, That was commytted, I dar ?ow wel assure, To the kepyng and the besy cure Of cruel Mars, the my?ty god of werre, Whiche with þe stremes of his rede sterre And influence of his deite, Ordeyned hath, by ful gret cruelte, This Ram to kepe, bolys ful vnmylde, With brasen feet, ramegous and wylde, And ther-with-al ful fel and dispitous, And of nature wood and furious, To hurte and sleen euere of o desyre. Out of whos mouthe leuene &amp; wylde fire, Lyche a flawme euere blasid oute To brenne al hem þat stode ny? aboute; Eke of her eyen þe lokys moste orible To [a] furneis the stremys wer visible. And who that wolde, [to] encrese his glorie, This Ram of golde wynnen by victorie, Firste he moste of verray force and my?t Vn-to outraunce with thise bolys fi?t, And hem venquysche, aldirfirst of alle, And make hem humble as any oxe in stalle Vn-to the ?oke, and do hem ere þe londe; Of verray manhood, þis most he take on hond. And after þat he moste also endure With a serpent of huge and gret stature, With-out[e] fauour, pleynly haue a-do, To outraunce eke, with-oute wordis mo. Þe wiche serpent, schortly for to telle, Was lyche a fende comen out of helle, Ful of venym and of cruel hate; And with skalys hard as any plate He armyd was, to sto[n]den at diffence; And his breth wers than pestilence Infecten wolde environ al þe eyre In iche place wher was his repeire. He was so ful of corrupcioun, And so dredful of infeccioun, That deth in sothe, schortly to deuise, Was the fyn of this hi?e emprise To swyche as wolde þis querel take on hond, I-lyche in oon, bothe to fre and bonde, But if he koude þe bet hym silf diffende. And of his conquest þis was eke the ende: Þat whan he had þe my?ty serpent slawe, He most anoon, by custom and by lawe, Out of his hed his tethe echon arace, And thane sowe hem in the silf[e] place Where the oxes herid hadde aforn; Of whiche sede ther sprang a wonder corn: Kny?tes armyd, passyng of gret my?te, Eueryche with other redy for to fy?te Til eche his brother hadde brou?t to grounde By mortail fate, &amp; ?oue his deþis wounde. This was the ende of hem euerychon; For in sothnesse of al þer was noon That lyue my?t by that fatal lawe Any lenger in soth than his felawe. And by þis weye, dredful and perillous, Who desyreth to be victorious, He moste passe and manly it endure, And how so falle take his auenture. Of noon estat was noon excepcioun, Chese who so wele; for this conclusioun He may not skape for fauour ne for mede, Who euer gynne, avise hym wel I rede: For by the statute of the kyng he may, Who so that wele, entren and assay; But after þat he onys hath by-gonne He may nat chese til he haue lost or wonne. ?et, as somme of þis Ram expresse, And of þis flees also bere witnesse, It was no thyng but golde &amp; gret tresour, That Cethes kyng, with ful hy?e labour, Made kepe it by incantaciouns, By sorserye and false illucions, Þat was spoke of in rewmys fer aboute; For whyche many put her lyf in doute, Of hy?e desyr thei hadde for to wynne Þe gret[e] tresour þat was shette with-Inne Colchos lond, as ?e haue herde deuise; Whos pursute roos oute of couetise, Grounde &amp; rote of wo and al meschaunce, By veyn reporte hem silf[e] to avaunce; For whiche þei put hem silf in Iupartye, With-out[e] reskuse likly for to dye. Þer was noon helpe, ne noon sley?t of armys Þat vaille my?t ageyn þe cursed charmys; Þei wer so strong and supersticious, Þat many worthi, in kny?thood ful famous, Enhasted werne vn-to her dethe, allas, Þat list euparten her lyues in þis cas. And þis lasteth til afterwarde be-fel Þat Pelleus platly herde tel Þe gret[e] meschefes and destrucciouns In Colchos wrou?t on sondry naciouns, Þat pursued þe au[n]tres to conquere— Til Pelleus so ferforthe gan enquere, Þat he knewe holly how þe treuthe was; And in his herte anoon he gan compas, How he my?t by any sley?t[e] make His nevewe Iason for to vndirtake Þis hi?e emprise in Colchos for to wende, By whiche weye best he my?t hym schende; And [gan] pretend a colour fresche of hewe, I-gilt outward so lusty and so newe, As þer wer no tresoun hydde with-Inne; And sawe it was tyme to begynne On his purpos, þei first he made it queynte, And gan with asour &amp; with golde to peynte His gay wordys in sownynge glorious, Knowyng Iason was ?onge and desyrous Vn-to swyche thing, and ly?tly wolde enclyne. Therfor he thou?t þat he nolde fyne Pleynly to wirke to his confusioun, And made anoon a conuocacioun Of his lordys and his baronye, Aboute enviroun the londe of Thesalye, For tassemble estates of degre Of al his rewme with-In þe chefe cite. For to holde a counseil outterly he caste, Þer-by tacheve his desire as faste; And so his court contwneth daies thre; Til at þe laste his hidde iniquyte He gan out rake, þat hath ben hid so longe, For he ne my?te no lenger forthe prolonge Þe venym hid, þat frat so at his herte, In so sly?e wyse þat no man my?t aduerte Vp-on no syde but þat he mente wel. For þe tresoun was cured euerydel And curteyned vnder trecherye; For he this thing so sly?ly gan to guye At pr[i]me face þat no man my?t[e] deme By any worde, as it wolde seme, In cher, in port, by signe or daliaunce, But þat he cast kny?tly for tavaunce His ?onge nevewe, as by lyklynesse, To hi?e honour of manhood and prowesse. For of þe entent, of whiche he gan purpose, Þe tixte was hyd, but no thing þe glose, Whiche was conueied so with flaterye, Þat the peple cowde not espye Lytel or nou?t of his entent with-Inne. For whiche anoon to preyse hym þei be-gynne, Þat he suche honour to his nevewe wolde; For with swyche cher he be-gan vnfolde To-forn hem al his entencioun, Þat he hath voided al suspecioun From al þat wern assemblid in þe place; And toward Iason he torne gan his face Ful lovyngly in countenaunce and chere, And to hym seide, þat alle my?ten here Thoru?-out þe courte, whan maked was silence, Þus word by worde platly in sentence: “Cosyn Iason, take hed what I schal seyn, For þe I am so inly glad and feyn And supprised with myrth[e] þoru? myn herte, That it enchaseth &amp; voideth al my smerte, For to considere in myn inspeccioun Of þi ?owthe þe disposicioun, Þe whiche, schortly for to comprehende, Saue to vertu to no thyng doth entende, Vn-to worschip and to gentilnesse, To manly fredam and to hy?e largesse, Þat verraily, wher I wake or wynke, My Ioye is only ther-on for to thinke. My silf I holde so passynge fortunat, And al my londe, of hi?e and lowe estat, Þat lykly arn in honour for to flete, And to lyuen in reste and in quiete Thoru? thi support and þi sowpoaille, Whos manhod may so mochel vs availle, By lyklyhed, and so moche amende, In verray sothe to saue vs and diffende Agayn al tho, as I can descryue, Þat of malys wolde ageyn vs stryue Or rebelle in any maner weye, Of surqued ye or pride to werreye Our worthines, assured in tranquille, From al assaut of hem þat wolde vs ille, For to perturbe oure noble estat rial, Ageyn[e]s whom, whan þou art oure wal, Our my?ty schelde, and proteccioun: Þus deme I fully in myn oppinioun, For of þin age, þi witte, þi prouidence, Þi kny?tly hert, þi manly excellence, Reported ben, and þin hy?e renoun, In many londe and many regioun Þis rounde worlde aboute in circuyt; How my?t I [þanne] stonde in better ply?t, For þin honour, lyche as it is founde, To my worschip so hi?ly doth rebounde, Þat I wolde, pleynly, and nat cesse, ?iffe I koude, helpe to encresse Þin hi?e renoun y-wis in euery hour, And ther-vppon spendyn my tresour. Þis hi?e desyre, with-outen any faille, Of enteer loue me doth so sore assaille, Þat ny?t nor day I may haue no reste; And al schal turne I hope for the beste, For to enhaunce þin honour to þe heuene, Aboue þe pole and þe sterres seuene. To whiche þing I haue a weye espied, As I my witte þer-to haue applied, Þis is to mene, what schulde I lenger dwelle, My dere cosyn, as I schal the telle: ?if it so wer by manhood souereyne, Of þi kny?thood þat [þou] durst atteyne Þe flees of gold to conquere be þi strenthe, Whiche is spoke of so fer in brede and lenthe, And retourne hom in body safe and sounde; ?if þis conquest my?t in the be founde, Þat þou durstest acheuen þis emprise, More hertes Ioye koude I nat deuise In al þis worlde; for sothly at the best, My rewme and I set wer þan in rest: For, For þi manhod alle wolde vs drede. Wherfore, cosyn, of kny?thood and manhed Take vp-on þe my prayer and requeste, And here my trouthe, &amp; take it for beheste. What euer nedeth in meyne or costage, I wil my silf toward þis viage Ordeyne I-now? in harneys and array, Þat nou?t schal faylen þat is to þi pay; And, more-ouer, I pleynly the ensure, Þat ?if I se þou do þi besy cure, Þis hi?e emprise for to bringe aboute, Þou schalt nat fere nor [I-]be in doute, After my day, by successioun, For to be kyng of this regioun, And holy han septre and regalie. Wherfor, Iason, lyfte vp þin hertis eye, Thenke þi name schal longe be recorded Thoru?-oute þe worlde; wherfor be accor[ded] With-in þi silf, and pleynly nat ne spare Of þin entent þe somme to declare.” Whan Iason had his vncle vndirstonde, He reioyseth for to take on honde Þis dredful labour, with-out avisement; He nou?t aduerteth þe menyng fraudelent, Þe prevy poysoun vnder sugre cured, Nor how to galle with hony he was lured, Þe dirke deceyt, þe cloudy fals engyn, I-gilt with-oute, but vnder was venym, Wher-to Iason hath noon aduertence; Þe kyng, he wende, of clene conscience, With-out[e] fraude, had al þis þing I-ment; Wher-for anoon he ?eveth ful assent At wordis fewe, and pleynly gan to seie His vncles wyl þat he wolde obeye; He was accorded, in conclusioun, With humble herte and hool intencioun. Wher-of þe kyng resseyueth swyche gladnesse, Þat he vnnethe my?t it out expresse; But ry?t as fast dide his besy peyne For þis Iorney in hast for to ordeyne. And for as moche as Colchos, þe cuntre, Enclosed was aboute with a see, And þat no man, how longe þat he striue, With-out[e] schip theder may ariue, To his presence anoon he dide calle Famous Argus, þat koude most of alle To make a schip, &amp; first þat art y-founde To seille with by see fro lond to londe, Þe whiche hath wrou?t a schip by sotil craft, Which was þe first þat euer wawe rau?t, To haue entre; and Argon bar þe name. Gramariens recorde ?it the same, Þat eche gret schip, firste for þat mervail, Is called so, whiche proudly bare hir seil, As þis boke doth vs specifye, How it be-fel forth of þis navie. Whan al was redi, meyne and vitaille, Þei bide nou?t but wynde for to saille; And many worthi was in þat companye, Of noble byrth, and of gret allye, In þat viage redy for to goon, Bothe for loue and worschip of Iason. Amonges whiche þe grete Hercules, Of force, of my?t, of strenthe pereles; And he begete was vppon Almene, So inly fayr and wommanly to sene, Of Iubiter, and þat ful long a-gon, Takyng lyknesse of Amphytrion; Down fro heuene, for al his deyete, He was ravisched þoru? lust of hir bewte; For he hir loued with hert and hool entent. And of hem two, sothly by discent, Cam Hercules, þe worthi famus kny?te, Most renomed of manhood and of my?te, Whiche in his tyme was so merveillous, So excellent, and so victoryous, Þat Ouyde lyst recorde hym silue, Methamorphoseos, his famus dedis twelue, Whiche ben remembrid ther in special, In his honour for a memorial. And to reherse hem in order by and by, ?if ?e list here, I purpose outterly: He slou?e Antheon in þe eyr on hey?t, And many geant, what with my?t &amp; slei?te, He outraide, for al her lymes rude; Þe serpent Ydre he slou? eke in Palude, And Cerberus þe hownde he bond so sore, At helle ?atis þat he barke no more, And made hym voide his venym in þat strif, And vpwarde ?af hym suche a laxatyf, Þat al þe worlde his brethe contagyous Infected hath; it was so venymous. And with o wynde he wolde renne a stadye; He fledde arpies, briddes of Archadye, And slou? centauris, þe bestis monstruous; Þe feerse lyon he byrafte his hous; Þis [is] to seyen, whan þat he was slawe, Out of his skyn he hath hym stripte &amp; flawe, With cruel herte, þoru? his hi?e renoun; Þe goldene applys he bare fro þe dragoun; Þe fyry cat he slou? with-out[e] more; And of Archadye, þe cruel tuschy boor; And at the last, on his schulders square, Of verray my?t þe firmament he bare. But for þat I may not rekne[n] al His passyng dedis, whiche ben historial, Redeth Ovide, and þer ?e schal hem fynde; Of his trivmphes how he maketh mynde, Þoru?-out þe worlde how he hym honour fette, And of þe pelers at Gades þat he sette, Whiche Alysaundre of Macedonye kyng, Þat was so worthi her in his lyvyng, Rood in his conqueste, as Guydo lyst to write, With al his hooste proudly to visite; Be-?ownde whiche no land is habitable, Nor see to saille sothly couenable: So fer it is by-?onde þe occian, Þat schipman noon ferþer [no] skyl[le] can; Sibellys streytes Maryners it calle, And þe boundes, þei named ben of alle, Of Hercules, for he hym silf hem sette, As for markys alle other for to lette Ferther to passe, as Guydo maketh mynde; And þe place is callyd, as I fynde, Syracenyca, as fyn of his labour, Or Longa Saphi, recorde of myn auctour. Of þis mater more what schulde I seyn; For vnto Iason I wil retourne a-geyn, Þat in al haste dothe hym redy make, Of his vncle whan he hath leue take, Toward þe see, and Hercules y-fere, With alle his men, anoon as ?e schal here. The tyme of ?er, whan þe schene sonne In his spere was so fer vp ronne, Þat he was passid þe sygne of Gemeny, And had his chare whirled vp so hy?, Thoru? þe drau?t of Pirous so rede, Þat he had made in þe crabbis hede His mansioun, and his see ryal, Where halved is þe standyng estyval Of fresche Appollo with his golden wayn; Whan heerdemen in hert[e] ben so fayn For [þe] hete to shroude hem in þe schade, Vnder þis braunchis and þise bowis glade; Whan Phebus bemys, þat so bry?t[e] schyne, Descended ben ry?t as any lyne, And cause þe eyre be refleccioun To ben ful hoot, þat lusty fresche sesoun, Whan cornys gynne in þe felde to sede; And þe grasys in the grene mede From ?er to ?er ben of custom mowe, And on þe pleyn cast and leide ful lowe, Til þe moystour consumed be a-way, On holt and heth þe mery somerys day— At whiche tyme þis ?ong[e] kny?t Iason With Hercules is to schip[pe] goon; And with hem eke, as I reherse can, Of Grekys eke [ful] many a lusty man, Schiped echon with ryal apparaille. And whan þei wer crossed vnder saille, With-Inne þe schip, whiche þat Argus made, Whiche was so stawnche it my?t no water lade, Þei gan to seille and had[de] wynd at wille; Þe schip gan breke þe sturdy wawys ille Vppon þe see, and so bothe day and ny?te To Colchos-ward þei helde þe weye ry?t, Guying her cours by the lode sterre, Wher þei seille by costys ne?e or ferre. For Philotetes was her alder guyde, Þat koude a-forn so prudently prouide, Of verray insi?t to cast a-forn and se Tempest or wynd, bothe on lond and see, Or whan ther schulde trouble of stormys fal; For he was mayster pleynly of hem alle In schipman crafte, and chose her gouernour, And koude hem warne aforn of euery shour That schulde falle, whan sterrys dide apere. And specialy, as Guydo doth vs lere, Þis Philotetes, whiche was no fool, Hadde moste his sy?t erect vn-to þe pool, His aduertence and clere inspectioun, To þe sterrys and constellacioun, Which þe axtre rounde aboute goon, Þat clerkis calle þe Septemtryon. For as þe pool y-called Arthicus Euere in on appereth vn-to vs, Ry?t so in sothe, who can loke ary?t, Antharticus is schrouded from our sy?t. But to schipmen þat ben discrete and wyse, Þat list her cours prudently deuise Vp-on þe see, haue suffisaunce y-nowe To guye her passage by Arthouris Plowe; For it to hem is direccioun Vn-to þe costis of euery regioun, With help only of nedle and of stoon, Þei may nat erre what costys þat þei gon. For maryners þat ben discrete and sage, And expert ben of her loodmanage By straunge costys for to seille ferre, Guyen her cours only by þe sterre Whiche þat Arthour compasseth enviroun; Þe whiche cercle and constellacioun I-called is the cercle Artofilax: Who knoweth it nedeth no more to axe. For it to schipmen on þe sterry ny?t Iis suffisaunt, whan þei sen his ly?t. And as poetis of þis poolis tweyne In her bokys lyketh for to feyne, And in her dytees declaren vn-to vs: Calixtone and Archadius, Hir oune sone, wern y-stellefied In þe heuene and y-deified; For that Iuno to hir hadde envie, With Iubiter whan sche dide hir espie. For whiche sche was in-to a bere turned, And for hir gilt sche hath in erthe morned, Til in-to heuene, Naso can ?ow telle, Sche was translated, eternally to dwelle Amongis sterrys, wher as sche is stallyd, And Vrsa Maior is of clerkys callyd; So as hir sone, for his worthi fame, Of Vrsa Mynor bereth ?et þe name. Of whiche þe course my?t[e] nat asterte Philotetes, þat was þe mooste experte Of alle schipmen þat euer I herde telle; For of konyng he my?t bere þe belle. And whan þe Grekys had[de] long[e] be Fordryue and cast, seilyng in þe se, For-weried after [her] trauaille, Þei cast [t]arive, ?if it wolde availle, Hem to refresche and disporte in Ioye, Vp-on þe boundys of þe lond of Troye. Howe Iason arryved bysyde Troy withe Hercules for to refresshe him and his menye. Whan Hercules and Iasoun on his hond, Out of her schip taken han þe lond, And with hem eke her kny?tes euerychon, Þat fro þe see ben to lond[e] goon, For-weried after her trauaille; And þei in sothe come to arivaille At Symeonte, an hauene of gret renoun, Þat was a lyte by-syde Troye town— And þei wer glad to ben in sikirnesse From storm and tempest after werynesse; For þei ne ment tresoun, harm, nor gyle, But on þe stronde to resten hem a while; To hynder no wy?t, of no maner age, Nor in þat Ile for to do damage To man [n]or beste, wher-euere þat þei goo, But for to abyde þer a day or two Hem to refresche, and repeire a-noon Whan þat þe rage of þe see wer goon. And whiles þei [vp-]on þe stronde leye, Þei no thyng dide but disporte and playe, And bathe &amp; wasche hem in þe fresche ryuer, And drank watrys þat were swote &amp; clere, Þat sprange lyche cristal in þe colde welle, And toke ri?t nou?t, but it were to selle. It was no þing in her entencioun Vn-to no wy?te to done offencioun, For to moleste or greuen ony wy?t; But þe ordre of Fortunys my?t Hath euere envy þat men lyue in ese, Whos cours enhasteth vnwarly to dissese. For sche was cause, God wotte, causeles, Þis gery Fortune, þis lady reccheles, Þe blynde goddesse of transmutacioun, To turne her whele by reuolucioun To make Troyens vniustly for to wene Þat Grekys werne arived hem to tene. So þat þe cause of þis suspecioun Hath many brou?t vn-to destruccioun. Ful many worthi of kynges and of princes Þoru?-oute þe worlde, rekned in provinces, Werne by þis sclawnder vn-to myschief brou?t, For thing, allas, þat was neuer thou?t. For it was cause and occasioun Þat þis cite and þis royal town Distroied was, as it is pleynly fownde, Whos walles hi?e were bete down to grounde. And many [a] man and many [a] worþi kny?te Were slawe þer, and many lady bry?te Was wydowe made by duresse of þis werre, As it is kouthe and reported ferre; And many mayde in grene &amp; tender age Be-lefte wer sool, in þat grete rage, Behynd her fadris, allas, it falle schulde! And for no þing but þat Fortune wolde Schewen her my?t and her cruelte, In vengaunce takyng vp-on þis cite. Allas, þat euere so worþi of estate Schulde for lytel fallen at debate! Whan it is gonne it is not ly?t to staunche: For of griffyng of a lytel braunche, Ful sturdy trees growe[n] vp ful ofte; Who clymbeth hy?e may not falle softe; And of sparkys þat ben of sy?t[e] smale, Is fire engendered þat devoureth al; And a quarel, first of lytel hate, Encauseth flawme of contek and debate, And of envie to sprede a-brod ful ferre. And þus, allas, in rewmys mortal werre [Is] First be-gonne, as men may rede and see, Of a sparke of lytel enmyte, Þat was not staunchid first whan it was gonne. For whan þe fyre is so fer y-ronne, Þat it enbraseth hertis by hatrede To make hem brenne, hoot as any glede, On ouþer party þoru? his cruel tene, Þer is no staunche but scharp[e] swerdys kene, Þe whiche, allas, consumeth al and sleth; And þus þe fyne of enmyte is deth. Þou? þe gynnyng be but casuel, Þe fret abydyng is passyng[ly] cruel To voide rewmys of reste, pees, and Ioye, As it fil whilom of þis worthi Troye. It doth me wepe of þis case sodeyne; For euery wy?t ou?te to compleyne, Þat lytel gylte schulde haue swyche vengaunce, Except parcas þoru? goddys puruyaunce, Þat þis mescheffe schulde after be Folwyng per-chaunse of gret felicite. For Troy[e] brou?t vn-to destruccioun, Was þe gynnyng and occasioun— In myn auctor as it is specified— Þat worthi Rome was after edefied By þe of-spryng of worþi Eneas, Whilom fro Troye whan he exiled was. Þe whiche Rome, rede and ?e may se, Of al þe worlde was hed and chef cite, For þe passyng famous worthinesse. And eke whan Troye was brou?t in distresse, And þe wallis cast and broke down, It was in cause þat many regioun Be-gonne was, and many gret cite: For þis Troyan, þis manly man Enee, By sondri sees gan so longe saille, Til of fortune he com in-to Ytaille, And wan þat lond, as bookes tellen vs. With whom was eke his sone Askanius, Þat after Enee next be-gan succede The lond of Ytaille iustly to possede; And after hym his sone Silvius, Of whom cam Brute, so passyngly famus. After whom, ?if I schal nat feyne, Whilom þis lond called was Breteyne; For he of geauntys þoru? his manhood wan Þis noble yle, and it first be-gan. From Troye also, with þis ilke Enee, Cam worthi Francus, a lord of hi?e degre, Whiche vp-on Rone, tencressen his renoun, Bilt in his tyme a ful royal tovn, Þe whiche sothly, his honour to avaunce, After his name he made calle Fraunce; And þus be-gan, as I vnderstond, Þe name first of þat worthi lond. And Anthenor, departyng from Troyens, Gan first þe cite of Venycyens; And Sycanus, with-Inne a lytel while, Gan enhabite þe lond of Cecyle. And after partyng of þis Sycanus, His worthi brother, called Syculus, So as I fynde, regned in þat yle; And after hym it called was Cecille. But Eneas is to Tuscy goon, It tenhabite with peple ri?t anoon; And in Cecille he Naplis first be-gan, To whiche ful many Neopolitan Longeth þis day, ful riche &amp; of gret my?t. And Diomedes, þe noble worþi kny?t, Whan Troye was falle with his toures faire, As to his regne he cast[e] to repaire, His leges gan to feynen a querele A-geyn[e]s hym, and schop hem to rebelle; And of malys and conspiracioun, Þei hym with-hilde bothe septer &amp; crovn, Her duete and her olde lygaunce, And hym denye trouþe and obeissance. Wher-for a-noon, so as bokes telle, With al his folke he went[e] for to dwelle Vn-to Callabre, and gan it to possede. And [þer] þe kny?tes of þis Dyomede, Þat fro Troye han him þider swed, To forme of briddes wern anon transmwed By Cyrces crafte, dou?ter of þe sonne, And in þe eyr to fleen anoon þei gonne, And called ben, in Ysidre as I rede, Amonges Grekys briddes of Dyomede. But as som bokys of hem ber witnesse, Þis chaunge was made be Venus þe goddesse, Of wrath sche had to þis worthi kny?te; Only for sche sawe hym onys fy?te With Eneas, hir owne sone dere. At whiche tyme, as þei fau?t I-fere, And Diomede with a darte I-grounde Gan hame at hym a dedly mortal wounde, His moder Venus gan anoon hym schroude Vnder a skye and a mysty cloude, To sauen hym þat tyme fro meschaunce. And for þis skyl Venus took vengaunce: In-to briddes to turne his meyne. And in þat forme fro ?er to ?er þei fle Vn-to his towmbe, wher as he is graue. So vp-on hym a mynde ?it þei haue, Þat of custom for a remembraunce, A rite þei holde and an observaunce At his exequies, þise briddes euerychon, A dayes space, and þennys nou?t ne gon. And ouer-more, as it to hem is dwe, Þei loue Grekis, and platly þei eschewe Latyns alle, for ou?t þat may be-tyde: For þei present, a-noon þei flen aside; And eche from other, as bokys vs assure, Þis briddes knowe, only of nature, Grekys and Latyns kyndely assonder, Whan þei hem seen: þe whiche is swiche a wonder Vn-to my witte, þat I can nou?t espie Þe causys hid of swiche sorcerye— But wel I wot, þou? my wit be blent, Þat rote of al was fals enchauntement. But of our feithe we ou?te to defye Swiche apparencis schewed to þe eye, Whiche of þe fende is but illusioun— Her-of no more. &amp; þus whan Troie tovn Euersed was, and I-brou?t to nou?t, Ful many cite was I-bilt and wrou?t, And many lond and many riche tovn Was edified by thocasioun Of þis werre, as ?e han herde me telle. Whiche to declare now I may not dwelle From point to point, lyche as bokis seyn, For to Iason I wil resorte ageyn, Þat londed is with worthi Hercules At Symeonte, þe hauene þat he ches, As I haue tolde, to reste hem &amp; counforte, And for not elles but only to disporte. But to þe kyng, regnyng in Troye town, Þat was þat tyme called Lamedown, Of fals envy reported was and tolde, How certeyn Grekis wern of herte bolde To entre his lond, þe whiche þei nat knewe, Wel arrayed in a vessel newe. Whiche to arryve had[de] no lycence, And hem purpose [for] to doon offence, Be liklyhed, and his lond to greue: For þei of pryde, with-outen any leue Or safcondyte, han þe stronde y-take; And swiche maistries on þe lond þei make, As in her power wer alle maner thyng, Havyng no rewarde pleynly to þe kyng; Of his estat take þei noon hede. Of swyche straungeris gretly is to drede, ?iffe men be laches outher necligent Fully to wit what is her entent, But furthe prolong, &amp; no pereil caste: Swiche sodeyn þing wolde be wist as faste, And nat differrid til þe harme be do; It wer wisdam þat it were seie to: Men may to long suffryn and abyde Of necligence for to lete slyde For to enqueren of her gouernaunce. Þis was þe speche and þe dalyaunce, Eueryche to other by relacioun, In euery strete thoru?-oute Troye tovn. Somme rovnyng &amp; somme spak a-brood; And þis speche so longe þer a-bood From on to a-nother, sothly, þat þe sovn Reported was to kyng Lamedovn, As ?e han herde, þe whiche of wilfulnesse, With-out[e] counsail or avisenesse, To hast[i]ly maked hath his sonde, To wit how þei wern hardy for to londe Be-syde his leue, of presumpcioun. Wher-fore he bad, in conclusioun, With-oute abood sone to remwe, Or finally þei schulde nat eschewe To be compellid, mavgre who seith nay. And so þe kyng, vp-on a certeyn day, In haste hath sent his embassatour Vn-to Iason, of Grekys gouernour, Þat novther thou?t harme nor vylonye, But Innocent, with his companye, Disported hym endelong þe stronde, And euer hath do sethen he cam to londe. And of þe charge þat he on hym leyde, And word by word to Iason how he seide, As in effecte with euery circumstaunce, Þis was þe somme pleinly in substaunce: Howe Kenge Lamedon, by vndiscret councele, sent his messenger to Iason to go owt of his lande. “The wise, worthi, moste famus of renoun, Þe my?ty kyng, þe noble Lamedoun, Hath vn-to ?ow his message sent, Of whiche theffect, as in sentement, Is þis in sothe: þat he hath mervaille In-to his londe of ?our ariuaille, Bryngyng with ?ow Grekys nat a fewe, And haue no condyte with ?ow [for] to schewe, Proteccioun, pleynly, nor lycence, In preiudise of his magnificence. Wherfore he hath on me þe charge leyde, And wil to ?ow þat it be platly seyde, Þat ?e anoon, with-oute more delay, With-out[e] noyse, or any more affray, Of Troye lond þe bowndis þat ?e leve; Or ?ow and ?oures he casteth for to greve. And bet it is with ese to departe, Þan of foly ?our lyues to Iuparte, In any wyse, for lak of prouidence, Ageyns his wille to make resistence, Outher of pride or of wilfulnesse, For to be bolde with-oute avisenesse To interrupte his felicite; For he desyreth in tranquillite To holde his regne, with-oute parturbaunce. In whos persone is made swyche aliaunce Atwen his manhood &amp; royal mageste, Þat þei nyl suffre noon of no degre Tenpugne his quiete in any maner wyse, Wherfore I consaille, as ?e seme wyse, To taken hede vn-to þat I seye, And his byddyng no?t to disobeie, Liste ?e offende his kyngly excellence. For ?e schal fynde in experience, With-oute feynyng, sothe al þat I telle; Take hede, þerfor, I may no lenger dwelle From poynt to poynt, syth ?e be wis and sage, For þis is hool þeffecte of my massage.” Whan Iason herd of þe massanger Þise wordes alle, he gan chaunge cher, And kepte hym cloos, with sobre contenaunce, And was nat hasty for Ire nor greuaunce; For no rancour he cau?te of his tale, Saue in his face he gan to wexe pale, Long abydyng or ou?t he wolde seyn. And or he spak any worde ageyn Vn-to hym þat from þe kyng was sent, He gan disclose þe somme of his entent Vn-to his foolke stondyng ronde aboute; For vn-to hem he discurede oute Þe message hool, firste whan he abreide, And worde by worde þus to hem he seyde: Off the Answer of Iason to the messenger of Lamedown. “Sirs,” he seyth, “to ?ow be it knowe— Taketh hede, I praye, both hy? and lowe— How Lamedoun, þat is kyng of Troye, Hath sent to vs a wonderful envoye, Chargynge in haste to hy?e oute of his lond; And axeth how we vp-on þe stronde For to arive hadden hardinesse, With-oute leue: seth here his gentillesse, And his fredam, þe whiche is nat a lite! How lyche a kyng þat he can hym quite Vn-to straungerys þat entren in his Ile For nou?t, God wot, but for a litel while Hem to refresche, and departe anoon, Lyche as ?e can recorden euerychon, And bere witnes, bothe alle and somme. Allas, fredam, wher is it now be-com? Where is manhood, and gentilnesse also, Whiche in a kyng to-gidre bothe two Schulde of custom han her restyng place? And wher is honour, þat schulde also enbrace A lordis hert, whiche of kny?tly ry?t, Of manly fredam, with alle his fulle my?t, Schulde straungeris refresche and reconforte, Þat aftir-ward þei my?t of hym reporte Largesse expert, manhood, and gentillesse, Þat þei han founden in his worthinesse. For ?iffe noblesse wer of his allye, And fredam eke knyt with his regalye, So as longeth to honour of a kyng, He schulde haue chargid, first of al[le] thing, His worthi liges, with al þat my?t[e] plese, To haue schewed þe comfort and þe ese, With al hir my?t and her besy cure, Vn-to straungeris þat of aventure Wern in þe see dryuen and dismaied, And of our comfort nat ben euel [a]payed. For ?if þat he in any cas semblable, Outher by fortune þat is variable, By sort or happe, þat may not be wiþ-stonde, Arived had in-to Grekys londe, More honestly, lyche to his degre, He schulde of vs haue resseived be, Lyche as it longeth vn-to genterie. But syth þat he, for ou?t I can espie, Hath fredam, honour, and humanite Atonys made oute of his courte to fle, Chose dishonour and late worschip goon— Þer is no more, but we schal euerychon, Þat he hath chosen help[e] to fulfille, Whan power schal nat be lyke his wille; Þis [is] to seyne, and sothe it schal be founde, Þat his dede schal on hym silfe rebounde— Sith of malys he hath þis werke be-gonne— Paraventure or þe somer sonne Þe sodiak hath thries gon aboute. For late hym trust, &amp; no þing ben in doute, We schal hym serue with swyche as he hath sou?t; For ?if I lyue it schal be dere abou?t, Al-be þer-of I sette as now no tyde. And in his lond I nyl no lenger byde Til I haue leiser better to soiorne.” And with þat worde he gan anoon to turne With manly face and a sterne chere Sodeynly vn-to þe massangere, Þat fro þe kyng was vn-to hym sent; And in þis wyse he scheweth his entent: How Iason and Hercules toke displeasure with Kyng Lamedowne of Troye, gyuyng his messanger knowlege of their next commynge to gyue hym batayle For his vndiscreet commaundement. “My frende,” quod he, “I haue wel vnderstande Þe massage hool, þat þou toke on honde, Of þi kyng to bryng[en] vn-to vs Ri?t now vnwarly; &amp; syth it standeth þus, Þat I haue his menyng euerydel From point to point, &amp; vnderstonde it wel— For word by worde I haue it plein conseived, And þe ?iftes þat we han resseived On his by-halue in our gret[e] nede, I wil remembre, and take ri?t gode hede To euery þing þat þou hast vs brou?t. For trust[e] wel þat I for?ete it nou?t, But enprente it surly in my mynde; And with al þis, how goodly þat we fynde Þe gret[e] bounte in al maner thing, With-in þis lond of Lamedoun þi kyng: His wolcomyng and his gret[e] cher, And goodly sond þat þou bryngist her, Nat accordyng [vn-]to oure entent; For God wel wot, þat we neuer ment Harme vn-to hym, nor pleinly no damage To noon of his of no maner age. And her-vppon þe goddis inmortal, Þat of kynde ben celestial, Vn-to recorde with al myn hert I take; And touchyng þis my borwys I hem make, In witnessyng we ment[e] noon offence, Ne toke nat, as by violence, With-in his rewme of womman, child, nor man; And so þou maist reporte ?if þou can— But for þat we, fordriuen in þe se, Compellid wern of necessite For to ariue, as þou haste herd me seyn, Only to reste vs her vp-on þe pleyn, With-oute more, vn-to a certeyn day, And after-ward to holde furþe our way Vp-on our Iorneye, &amp; make no tariyng, Liche as þou maist recorde to þi kyng— And seye hym eke he schal þe tyme se Þat he par-avnter schal mow þanked be, Whan tyme comyth, by vs or by som other: Go furthe þi waye, &amp; seie hym þus, my brother.” And þan anoon, as Iason was in pes, Þe manly kny?t, þe worþi Hercules, Whan he had herd þis þing fro poynt to point, He was anoon brou?t in swyche disioint Of hasty rancour and of sodeyn Ire, Þe whiche his hert almost set afire, Þat sodeynly, as he abreyde abak, Of hi? disdeyn euen þus he spak, With cher askoyn vn-to þe messanger, And seide, “felaw, be no þing in wer Of our abidyng, but be ri?t wel certeyn, Þat or Tytan his bemys reise ageyn, We schal depart and to schip[pe] goon; Þat of oure men þer schal nat leuen oon With-Inne þis lond, &amp;, God to-forn, to-morwe. And her-vp-on haue her my feith to borwe; For we no lenger schal holden her soiour, For elles-wher we schal make our retour To-morwe erly in þe daw[e]nyng, Vp peyne of repref; and so go seie þi kyng. And or thre ?ere, ?if God vs graunt[e] lyf, Maugre who gruccheþ or makeþ any strif, Vn-to þis lond we schal a-geyn retourne, And caste anker a while to soiourne: Take hede, þerfore, and note wel þe tyme; A newe chaunge schal folwen of þis pryme— And þanne his power schal not so large strecche; Of his saufconduit lytel schal we recche. I seie þe platly, as is oure entent, We wil not haue [vn-]to his maundement But lytel reward, and we þat day abide; For takyng leue schal be set a-syde, Be-cause he hath now be-gonne a play Which we schal quite—be God, ?if [þat] I may!— Þat torne schal in-to his owne schame; And spare nou?t to seie þi kyng þe same.” Þis massanger þan gan ageyn replye, And seide, “syr, ?e may me not denye Of honeste my massage to declare; A-vise ?ow, for I wil not spare Þe kynges sonde pleynly for to telle. And wher-so be ?e lyst to goon or dwelle, ?e may ?it chese, who so be lefe or lothe; ?e haue no cause with me to be wroth; For it sit not vn-to ?our worthines, Yffe ?e take hede be weye of gentilnes, Of manassyng swiche arwes for to schete; For more honest it were ?oure þretyng lete, And kepe secrete til ?e ben at ?our large. For certeinly no parcel of my charge Is to striue with ?ow or debate. But bet it is by-tymes þan to late, Þat ?e be war for harme þat my?t[e] fale. And for my parte, I saie vn-to ?ow alle, It were pite þat ?e distroied were, Or any man hyndre schulde or dere So worþi persones, in any maner wise, Whiche ben so likly to be discret &amp; wise; And list with wordis as now I do ?ou greue, I saye no more, I take of ?ow my leue.” Howe Iason and Hercules departede from the bowndes of Troy towarde Calcos londe. The ny?t ypassed, at springyng of þe day, Whan þat þe larke with a blissed lay Gan to salue the lusty rowes rede Of Phebus char, þat so freschely sprede Vp-on þe bordure of þe orient; And Aurora, of hert and hool entent, With þe swetnes of hir siluer schoures Bedewed had þe fresche somer floures, And made þe rose with new[e] bawme flete, Þe sote lillye and þe margarete For to vnclose her tender leuys white, Oppressed hertes with gladnes to delyte Þat drery wern aforn of ny?tes tene; And hony-souklis amonge þe buschis grene Enbamed hadde enviroun al þe Eyr; Longe or Titan gan maken his repeire, With þe bri?tnes of his bemys merye For to reioische al oure Emysperye: For longe a-forn, or he dide arise, Þis worthi Iason in ful hasty wyse, And his felawe Hercules also, I-charged han hir schipmen haue a-do To hale vp anker and hem redy make; And bad in haste euery man to take Þe ri?t[e] weye vn-to schippe a-noon. For in sothnes, þis manly man Iason Þou?t he was not stuffid of meyne To gynne a werre on Troye þe cite; For he was not, schortly to conclude, Egal in noumbre nor in multitude, As for þat tyme, a werre to be-gynne. It was not likly þat he schulde wynne Victorie as tho, for þei wer but a fewe; And it is not holsom a man to hewe Abouen his hed, whan it is ouere hi?e, List þe chippis wil fallen in his eye. Wherfore of Frygye þei leue þe costis blyue; þei lifte vp sail; þe schip be-gan to driue; Þe wynde was good; þe goddys fauourable; Fortune her frende, þou? sche be variable. And þus to Colchos safe þei ben y-come, And vn-to londe, boþen al and some, Þei ben arived in a lytel space; For in þe see þei haue founden grace Of Neptunus, þat caused hem as blive, As I seide her, at Colchos for tarive. Now in þis Ile, and þis litel londe, Þat Colchos hi?t, ?e schal vnderstonde, How þat þer was a rial chef cite, In al þat reigne moste of dignyte, Of worthines, of ryches, and of fame, And Iachonytos þat tyme bar þe name— Chevest of alle, to spekyn of bildyng, And stretes large and corious howsyng, And þer-with-al dyched wel with-oute, Strong[e] wallid &amp; toured rounde aboute, Of huge hei?te and aboue batailled, Maskued also, lyst þei wer assailed, With many palys, staatly and royal, For [þer] þe sete was most principal, Þe kyng to abide bet þan elles-wher; And þat tyme it happed hym be þere. And he was callyd Cethes, as I rede, Ful renomed of kny?thood and manhede, And had aboute hym a wel beseyn meyne, Lyche as was sytting vn-to his degre; And euery-wher, londys enviroun, Þe fame spradde of his hi?e renoun. And al aboute þis my?ti chefe cite, Wher as Cethes helde his royal se, Wer fresche ryuers, of whiche þe water clene Liche cristal schon ageyn þe sonne schene, Fair[e] playnes, as Guydo bereth witnes, And holsom hylles ful of lustines, And many laye and many lusty welle. And þer wer eke, my auctor can ?ou telle, Ful many a parke, ful feir and fresche to sene, And many wode &amp; many medowe grene, With sondri floures amonge þe herbes meynt, Whiche on her stalke nature hath depeynt With sondri hewes, with-Innen and with-oute, After þe sesoun of somer cam aboute. For fyschyng, foulyng, &amp; haukyng eke also, For venerie and huntyng bothe two, Þe place was inly delittable; Of corn and greyne passyngly greable, And plenteuous in al maner thing. For þer men herde þe briddes freschely syng In tyme of ?ere in her armonye, Þat þe noyse and soote melodye On fresche braunches, ful delicious, Reioische wolde þise folkis amerous, Whom louys brond hath fired to þe hert, And adawen of her peynes smert, Þat certeinly whan þat grene ver I-passed were, ay fro ?er to ?er, And May was com, þe monyth of gladnes, And fresche Flora, of flouris emperes, Hadde clad þe soile new at her devise, Þis noble place was like a paradyse. And Ceres, goddesse of largesse and foysoun, Swyche plente ?af vn-to þat regioun, Of flesche, fische, vyn, vitaille, and corne, Þat þe licour of her ful[le] horne Vp-on þat lond so gan reine and snowe, Þat alle estatis, bothe hi?e and lowe, Ladden her lyf in souereyn suffisaunce, With al þat Nature coude or my?t avaunce Þis litel Ile with her giftes grete, Lyche as to-forn ?e haue herde me trete. For þer was plente, &amp; þer was abundaunce, And þer was al þat my?t[e] do plesaunce To any herte, and al commodite. And so bifel, that to þis cite Iason is come, and with hym Hercules, And after hem foloweth al þe pres, Ful wel arraied and rially beseyn, Armys enclosed to-gydre tweyn &amp; tweyn— A peple chose as it wer for þe nonys; And þer-with-al of brawnys &amp; of bonys, Eueryche of hem of makyng and fasioun Ful wel complete by proporcioun, ?ong of age and of good stature, Of countenaunce sad and ful demwre, Þat euery wy?t had[de] gret plesaunce To sen þe maner of her gouernaunce: So ?ong, so fresche, hardy [and] meke also. And al attonys þei to þe paleys goo With swiche a cher, þat eueryche hath disport To sen þe maner of her noble port. So gentilmanly þei demened were, Þat þe peple gan presen euery-where To sen þis straungeris, lyche þe Grekis gyse, Demene hem silfe in so thrifty wyse; And of desyre þe peple nolde cesse Abouten hem to gadren and empresse, And to enquere what þei my?t[e] be, Þat of newe with swiche rialte Ben sodeynly entred in-to towne. Þus eueryche wolde with his felawe rowne; Þei wern so rude to staren and to gase, To gape &amp; loke, as it wer on a mase; Þis townysche folk do so comownly On euery þing þat falleth sodeinly. But how þat Cethes, liche a worthi kyng, Whanne þat he herde first of her comyng, Receyveth hem and hooly þe maner, ?iffe þat ?e liste, anoon ?e schal [it] here. Howe Kenge Cethes of Calcos wirshipffully ressavith Iason and Hercules into his Cytee Called Iaconythes, wher þe Flees of golde was. Whan þat þe kyng hath sothly vnderstonde How þe Grekis comen wer to londe, And how Iason was also þer-with-al, Borne by discent of þe blood roial Of Thessalye, and likly to ben eyr, If he by grace haue ageyn repeyr, Þe aventures acheved of Colchos, Þe kyng anoon out of his se a-roos Of gentilnes, in al þe haste he may, In godely wyse to mete hem on þe way, And hem receyveth with chere ful benyngne; And vn-to hem anoon he doth assigne His offyceris tawayte hem ny?t and day, Chargyng hem in al maner way, Þat what-so-euer may to hem don ese, Or any þing þat may hem queme or plese, Þat þei it haue in foysoun and plente, Eueryche of hem, lyche to his degre. Þus he comaundeth in al maner þing. And þan anoon þis noble worthi kyng, As he þat was of fredam a merour, Thoru? many halle and many riche tour, By many tourn and many diuerse way, By many gre made of marbil grey, Hath hem conveied a ful esy pas, Til he hem brou?t þer his chambre was, Wher he with hem helde his daliaunce. And þer anoon with euery circumstaunce Of manly fredam, he made to hem chere; And in his chambre, englasid bri?t and clere, Þat schon ful schene with golde &amp; with asure Of many ymage þat was þer in picture, He hath commaunded to his officeris, Only in honour of hem þat were straungeris, Spicys and wyn, and after þat anoon, Þe ?onge fresche, þe lusty man Iason, As faste gan be lycens of þe kyng For to declare þe cause of his comyng. But first þe kyng, with gret rialte, Ascendid is in-to his royal se, Clothis of gold hanged enviroun After þe custom of þat regioun, Þat to be-holde it was a noble sy?te, Stondyng aboute many [a] worthi kny?te And many squier and many gentil man Ful wel be-seyn; and þe kyng ri?t than, Vn-to Iason, stondyng in presence, Comaunded hath of his magnificence, With Hercules to sitte dovn by-syde, And Iason þan no lenger liste abyde Of his comyng þe cause for to schewe, Þeffecte of whiche was þis in wordis fewe— Saue Iason, or he his tale gan, Ful wel avised, and cherid lyche a man, Conceyved hath and noted wonder wel From point to point his mater euerydel, And nat for-gat a word in al his speche; But evene lik as rethorik doth teche, He gan his tale so by crafte conveie To make þe kyng, to þat he wolde seie, Condescende, and rather to encline For tassent þat he my?t[e] fyne Of his comyng þe kny?tly hi?e emprise, Þus worde by worde as I schal her deuise: Howe Iason purposede his instance in þe presence of Kenge Cethes of Colcos to grante him licence to darreyn batel for þe flees of golde. “Ry?t worthi prince, present in þis place, Only with support of ?our hi?e grace, And ?our goodnes, most excellent and digne, With pacience of ?our fauour benigne, Disple[se] it not þat I may seyn and schewe, And declare with wordys but a fewe Þe fynal grounde and cause of my comyng; So þat ?e list, whiche ben so noble a kyng, In goodly wyse, with-oute more offence, Benygnely to ?even audience To my request, and [þat] ?e nat disdeyne Goodly to graunte þat I may atteyne In þis Ile, ?if it may availe, Þe flees of gold frely for tassaile, As þe goddys in þis auenture List to ordeyne for my fatal ewere. In whom lyth al, pleynly, and fortune, For to gouerne thinges in comowne, In werre and pees, conquest and victorie, And of armys þe renoun and þe glorie, Discomfeture &amp; bringyng to outraunce— Al lyth in hem to hyndren or avaunce— Ageynes whos my?t no mortal man may chese. But for al þis, wheþer I wynne or lese, Or life or dethe be fyn of my labour, ?iffe þat ?e list to done me þis fauour, To geve me leue and no more delaie, I am acorded fully for to assaye, Liche as þe statut maketh mencioun. Me liste to make noon excepcioun, Vp-on no syde fauour for to fynde; But as þe Rytys pleynly make mynde, What euer falle, I schal hem vnderfonge, Lawly besechyng þat ?e nat prolonge My purpos now, and maketh no delay, But of ?our grace setteth me a day Myn emprise þat I may acheve; For myn abood stant vp-on ?our leue— Seith but a worde of grauntyng at þe leste, And þan I haue þe fyn of my requeste.” And whan þe kyng had herd ceryously Þentent of Iason, seide so manfully, He stynt a litel, and kepte hym clos a while; Til at þe laste he goodly gan to smyle Toward Iason, and seyd[e] to hym þus: “Iason,” quod he, “þou? þou be desyrous To vnderfonge þis passyng hi?e emprise, Mi counsail is, liche as I schal deuise, Ful pruden[t]ly for to caste a-forne Þe mortal pereyl, or þat þou be lorne; For in þis þing þer is a lawe set Be enchauntement, þat may nat be let Nor remedied, for fauour nor for mede. For deth in soth, who so taketh hede, Is þe guerdoun platly or þei twynne, Of all þat caste hem þe flees of gold to wynne. For help is noon in manhod nor fortune; Þe streyte weye is so importune, So dredful eke, and so ful of rage, Þat saue dethe, þer is no passage, Of victorie þe palme to conquere. For sothly, Iason, as I schal þe lere, Founded of old by merueillous wyrkyng Ben þe statutes of þis mortal þing; So sore bounde vnder my regalye Þat þe rigour I may nat modefye. Wherfore, Iason, or þou þis þing attame, Liste afterward on me wer laide þe blame Of þi lesyng or destructioun, Of feythful hert and trewe entencioun I warne þe, my siluen for to quite; So þat no man iustly schal me wyte, Þou?e þou of ?ouþe &amp; of wilfulnes Þi silfe distroye, with-out avisenes, Syth I aforne, of þis perillous cas, From point to point haue tolde þe al þe cas. Be now avised, and put no faute in me, For þe surplus frely lyth in þe, Of al þis þing, siþen þou maist chese; And wher-so [be], þat þou wynne or lese, No man to me it iustly may arrette: For þe lawe þat Mars hym silfe sette, No mortal man of due ri?t may passe; For hi?e nor lowe get noon other grace, Þan þe goddys list for hym ordeyne, What euere he be þat cast hym to darreyne Þis diuerse þing, moste furious of drede. Wherfore, Iason, how-euer þat þou spede, I haue to þe openly declared Holly þe pereil, and for no fauour spared, As fer in sothe as resoun, wil, and ri?t; For þou wost wel, it lyth nat in my my?t For to debarre, or any man to lette, Þat of manhood kny?tly cast to sette Vp-on þis þing, as þou hast herde me telle. What schulde I lenger in þis mater dwelle, Iit wer but vayn, for now þou knowest al. Be war of hir þat turneth as a bal; For at þis tyme þou gest no more of me— Do as þou list, I putte þe choyse in the.” And with þat word the kyng ros vp anoon, Vp-on þe tyme whan he schulde goon Vn-to his mete, and Iason by his syde, As ?e schal here, ?if ?e liste abide. Howe Kenge Cethes sent for his doughtire Medea to chere his straungers, to his owne damage. The tyme aprocheþ, &amp; gan to nei?en faste, Þat officeris ful besely hem caste To make redy, with al her fulle cure, And in þe halle þe bordis for to cure; For by þe dyal þe hour þei gan to marke, Þat Phebus southward was reised in his arke So hi?e alofte þat it drowe to noon, Þat it was tyme for þe kyng to goon Vn-to his mete and entren in-to halle. And Cethes þanne, with his lordis alle, And with his kny?tes aboute hym euerecchon, With Hercules, and also with Iason, Is set to mete in his roial se, And euerych lord, lyche to his degre. But firste of alle, þis worþi man Iason Assigned was, by þe kynge anoon, For to sitten at his owne borde; And Hercules, þat was so gret a lorde, Was set also faste by his syde. And þe marchal no lenger list abide Tassigne estatis wher þei schulde be, Liche as þei wern of hi?e or low degre; And after þat, on scafold hi?e a-lofte, Þe noyse gan, lowde &amp; no þing softe, Both of trompetis and of clariouneris. And þer-with-alle þe noble officeris Ful þriftely serued han þe halle, Liche as þe sesoun þat tyme dide falle, With alle deintes þat may rekned be; Þat sothfastly þe foysoun and plente Of kny?tly fredam vn-to hi?e and lowe, So fulsomly gan to reyne and snowe, Þat þoru? þe halle was þe manhod preised Of þe k[i]ng, and his renoun reysed, Þat can his gestis, sothly for to seye, Whan þat hym liste, cheren and festeye So liche a kyng, and in so þrifty wyse, With al deinte þat man can deuise. For at þis feste and solempnite, Þe Grekis my?t þe grete nobley se Of kyng Cethes, and þe worthines, And by reporte þer-of bere witnes Wher-so þei com, after al her lyue. I want[e] connynge, by ordre to discrive Of euery cours þe diuersytes, Þe straunge sewes and þe sotiltes Þat wer þat day seruid in þat place. Hath me excused, þou? I li?tly passe, Þou? I can not al in ordre seyn; Myn englische is to rude and eke to pleyn For to enditen of so hi?e a þing. But forthe I wil reherse how þe kyng To schewe his gestis his nobley ouer al, Hath for his dou?ter sent in special, And bad sche schulde forth anon be brou?t. Þe whiche in soth, þou? men had[de] sou?t Þis world þoru?-out, I do ?ou plein assure, Men my?t haue founde no fairer creature, More wommanly of port nor of manere, Nor more demwr, nor sadder of hir chere, Whos bewte was not likly for to fade. And whan sche cam þe Grekis for to glade, Þe halle in soth sche walkyth vp and down, Of wommanhed and pure affeccioun To make chere vn-to þe[se] gestis newe. And þus Medea with hir rosene hewe, And with freschenes of þe lyle white, So entermedled of kynde be delite, Þat Nature made in hir face sprede So egally þe whyte with þe rede, Þat þe medelyng, in conclusioun, So was ennewed by proporcioun, Þat finally excesse was þer noon, Of neuer nouþer; for bothe two in oon So Ioyned wer, longe to endure, By thempres þat callyd is Nature. For sche hir made lyke to hir deuise, Þat to biholde it was a paradys, In verray soth, bothe to oon and alle, Of olde and ?ong syttyng in the halle. Þer-to sche was, as by successioun, Born to be eyr of þat regioun, After hir fader, by discent of lyne, ?if sche abide and dure after his fyne; Syth he ne hadde by ri?t[e] to succede Non eyr male þat I can of rede. Sche was also, þe bok maketh mencioun, Wexe vn-to ?eris of discrecioun, Able for age maried for to be; And not-with-standyng also ek þat sche Was of bewte and of wommanhede, On þe faireste þat I can of rede, ?it [n]oon of bothe han hir ?outhe let, Þat to clergye hir desire was set So passyngly, þat in special, In alle þe artis called liberal Sche was expert &amp; knowyng at þe beste; It was hir ewre to konne what hir liste. Of swyche a womman herde I neuer telle. At Elicon sche drank so of þe welle, Þat in hir tyme was þer noon semblable I-founde in soth, ne noon þat was so able To conceyve by studie and doctrine. And of naturis disputen and termyne Sche koude also, and þe causis fynde Of alle þinges formed as by kynde; Sche hadde in lernyng so hir tyme spent, Þat sche knewe of þe firmament Þe trewe cours, and of þe sterris alle, And by her mevyng what þat schulde falle, So expert sche was in astronomye. But most sche wrou?t by nygromauncye, With exor?ismes and coniurisons; And vsed also to make illusions With hir charmys seide in sondri wyse; And with rytis of diuerse sacrifice, Encens and rikelis cast in-to þe fire, To schewe þinges liche to hir desyre— With gotis hornys and with mylke and blod, Whan þe mone was equat and stood In þe fifþe or þe seuenþe hous, And was fortuned with lokyng gracious, To chese an hour þat were conuenient And fortunat, by enchauntement, To make and werke sondry apparences: So wel sche knewe þe heuenly influences And aspectis, bothe wroþe and glade; For sche by hem alle her þingis made Þat appartene to swyche experimentis. For whan hir list, by hir enchauntementis, Sche koude make þe wyndes for to blowe, To thondre and li?te &amp; to hayle and snowe, And frese also, to greue men with peyne; And sodeinly sche coude make it reyne, Schewe what wedir þat hir liste to haue, And gasten men with sodein erthe-quave, And turne þe day vnwarly vn-to ny?t; And þanne anoon make þe sonne bri?t Schewe his bemys, ful persyng and ful schene, With goldene hornys, to voyde ny?tes tene; And reyse floodis, with many dredful wowe; And whan hir list sche koude hem eft with-drawe. Eke ?onge trees to sere, rote and rinde, And afterward make hem, agein[es] kynde, With lusty braunchis blosme and budde newe; Also in wynter with flouris fresche of hewe Araye þe erþe and tapite hym in grene, Þat to beholde a Ioye it was to sene; With many colour schewyng ful diuerse, Of white and rede, grene, ynde, and pers, Þe day[e]s[y]e with hir riche croune, And oþer floures, þat wynter made froune, Vp-on her stalke freschely for tapere. And sodeinly, with a dedly chere, Sche koude somer in-to wynter torne, Causyng þe day with mystes [for] to morne; And olde men sche koude make ?ong, And eft ageyn, or any her was sprong, Sche koude hem schew boþe in hed &amp; berd Ful hor and grey, in craft sche was so lered. And trees with frute sche koude make bare Of rynde and lef, to do men on hem stare; Clipse þe mone and þe bri?t[e] sonne, Or naturally þei hadde her cours y-ronne To hem approprid, whiche þei may not passe; For ?if þat Titan his cours by kynde trace, Whan he meveth vnder þe cliptik lyne, Þe clips mote folowe, as auctours list diffyne: So þat þer be, by hir discripcioun, Of bothe tweyne ful coniunccioun, And þat þe sonne with his bemys rede Haue his dwellyng in þe dragoun hede, And þe mone be set eke in þe tail, As by nature, þan it may nat feil Þat þer mote falle Eclips of verray nede, In sondri bokys liche as ?e may rede, Be-cause of certein intersecaciouns Of diuerse cercles, and reuoluciouns, Þat maked ben in þe heuene alofte, Whiche causen vs for to faylen ofte Of þe fresche comfortable stremys Þat ben to vs yschad fro Phebus bemys. For þe mone hath made deuisioun By hir sodeyn interposicioun, Þat of oure si?t þe stremys visual May nat be-holde, nor I-sen at al, Nor to oure lust fully comprehende, How Appollo is in his chare schynende, As we wer wont a-fornhand for to se. But of al þis þe grete Tholome, Kyng of Egypte, telleth þe cause why, With-Inne his boke ful compendyously, Bothe of Eclips and coniunccioun, And whi þei falle by natural mocioun. But of Medee, þou? þis clerke Ouide, Tencrese hir name vp-on euery syde, List in his fables swyche þinges telle, Þou? he of poetis was þe spring &amp; welle: Yit God forbede we schulde ?if credence To swyche feynyng, or do so hi?e offence; Syth of nature muste be denyed Al swyche affermyng, and also ben diffied Of euery cristen stedefast in bileue. For certeinly it wolde hi?ly greue Our conscience, in any wise wene, Ageyn[e]s kynd, whiche is so hi?e a quene, Þat any wy?t or lyvyng creature Scholde haue power, I do ?ow pleyn assure, So cursede þinges supersticious To do or worche, to kynde contrarious. For God almy?ti, Iuge of Iuges alle, Hath sette a lawe, [þe] whiche may nat falle, Amonge planetis perpetuelly tendure, A-forn ordeyned in his eternal cure, Þe whiche may nat, as clerkys list termyne, Vp-on no syde bowe nor decline; But as þei wern from discord or debat Eternally yformed and creat, Thoru? þe fynger of his sapience, Alwey to meve in her intelligence Lyche as þei ben to his lordschip bovnde. For neuer ?it ne was eclips y-fovnde, Þe mone not beynge in coniunccioun, As I haue tolde, saue in þe passioun; Þe whiche eclips was ageyn[e]s kynde; Nature her knot þat tyme dide vnbynde, Whan Goddis sone starfe vp-on þe rode. Þe sonne of life was dirked for oure goode, Whan heuene and erþe with hi?e compunccioun Han signes schewed of lamentacioun, By erþequaves li?t turned to dyrknes, And dede bodies vpward gan hem dresse From her tombis ageyn fro deth to lyue; Stoon and roche a-sonder gonne riue; In þe temple þe veil was kut on two; And signes many wern I-schewed tho— Þat for wonder and tokenes merveilous, Þe grete worþi Dionisius, Whiche at Athens, as clerkis of hym wryte, Was called in scolis Ar[y]opagite, Þat whan he sawe—þis noble famus clerke— Þe bri?t[e] day sodeynly so derke— Al-þei he were a paynym in þo dawes, And was infecte with rytys of her lawes, As he þat was most chef and principal Of philisophres, for to rekne al— Yet þat tyme, astonyed in his mynde, Seide platly: “ouþer [þe] god of kynde Suffreth þe dethe, ouþer—out of doute— Þis rounde worlde whiche is so large aboute Schal be dissoluid and y-brou?t to nou?t By sodeyn chawnge, hasty as a thou?t.” By his clergie he knewe no better skylle. For God þat may al chaungen at his wille, And hath power of swiche coaccioun, Vnder whos my?t and disposicioun Is lawe of kynde constreyned, soth to seie, From point to point lowly to obeye In euery þing þat hym list ordeyne— Of elementis he may þe cours restreyne, As holy writ witnesseþ: ?e may se How at þe requeste of worþi Iosue, Þe bri?t[e] sonne stood at Gabaon A dayes space in O degre, and schoon, Schewyng þis tokne to his trewe kny?t, Fynally for to ?eue hym ly?t, Þat he my?t by his hi?e prowes His cruel foon manfully oppresse, Whan þat he fau?t, þis kny?t, þis Iosue, With kingges fyve, reignyng in Amorre: So longe laste þe pursute and þe chas, Til þei were take, and for her trespas Demp[t] to be ded, þe bible can ?ou telle. Now syth þat God þus hi?ly list fulfille Of his kny?t requeste and orisoun, What wonder wast þou? in þe passioun Of Criste Iesu, incarnat for oure sake, Þe sonne bemys þou? þei wexe blake; Sith he hath lordschipe of planetis alle, And as hym list nedis it mote falle. For of Medea thou?e Ovidius In his fables rehersyth and writ þus, As he þat liste hir name to exalte, ?et from þe trouþe somwhile he doth halte, Al-be sche were a passyng sorceresse, And ferþest named of any chanteresse— I wil passe ouer ageyn to my matere, And how sche cam to mete ?e schal here. Whan hir fader hadde for hir sent, Sche cam anoon at his comaundement; But or sche cam, I fynde þat to-fore, For to make hir bewte semyn more, In hir closet sche toke hir beste array, For to encrese al þat [euer] sche may Natures wirke with royal apparaille. For þis wommen gladly wil nat feylle, Whan þei of bewte haue plentevous largesse, To make it more þei don her besynesse, With riche attire vppon euery syde; ?if ou?t be mysse, þei can it close and hide, For al þe foule schal couertly be wried, Þat no defaute outward be espied. But sche was bothe fayre &amp; wel beseyn, And in hir port [so] wommanly certeyn, Þat hir comynge gladeth al þe halle; For it was Ioye vn-to oon and alle To sen þe maner tho of hir entre. To whom hir fader bad to take hir see Be-syde Iason, hym for to disporte Of wommanhede, and to recomforte. Howe Medea first lovede Iason, and of þe insaciate change and mutabilite of women. But o, allas, þer lakked hi? prudence, Discret avis of inward prouidence, Wisdam also, with pereil caste a-fore, To trust a maide of tendre ?eris bore, Of vnhappy fonned wilfulnes! For þis kyng, of his gentelnes, Comaunded hath to his confusioun, To his dishonour and destruccioun, His owne dou?ter, born to be his eyr, Þat was also so wommanly and fair, So sodeynly doune to descende— Considered nat þe meschef of þe ende. Allas, why durst he in hir ?outhe affie, To make hir sytten of his cortesie, Wher sche my?t by casuel mocioun Ful li?tly cacche or han occasioun To don amys; allas, whi dide he so! Why list hym nat taken hede þer-to, Nor to aduerte in his discresioun, Wysly to caste a-forn in his resoun Þe vnwar chaunge þat is in wommonhed, Whiche euery [wise] man ou?t[e] for to drede! For who was euer ?it so mad or wood, Þat ou?t of resoun conne ari?t his good, To ?eue feith or hastily credence To any womman, with-oute experience, In whom is nouther trust ne sikernesse. Þei ben so double &amp; ful of brotilnesse, Þat it is harde in hem to assure; For vn-to hem it longeth of nature, From her birth to hauen alliaunce With doubilnes and with variaunce. Her hertes ben so freel and vnstable, Namly in ?outhe, so mevynge and mutable, Þat so as clerkis of hem liste endite (Al-be þat I am sori it to write) Þei seyn þat chawng and mutabilite Appropred ben to femyn[yn]yte— Þis is affermed of hem þat were ful sage. And speciali while þei be tender of age, In her wexyng, and whan þat þei be ?onge; Whos herte acordeth ful selde with her tonge. For if þe trouthe inwardly be sou?te, With þe surpluse and remnaunte of her þou?te, Men may þer þe trewe patron fynde Of Inconstaunce, whos flaskisable kynde Is to and fro mevyng as a wynde, Þat Hercules wer nat strong to bynde, Nouther Sampson, so as I bileue, Wommannes herte to make it nat remeve. For as þe blase whirleth of a fire, So to and fro þei fleen in her desire, Til þei acomplische fulli her delite. For as matere by naturel appetit, Kynd[e]ly desyreth after forme, Til he his course by processe may parforme, So þis wommen restreyn[en] hem ne can To sue her lust ay fro man to man. Howe women be nevere content in lustes Abitite til þai han assaiede þe abitite of þere Eye. And þat is, fro man to man. Þei wil not cesse til al be assaied; But wolde God, as mater is apaied With o forme, and holdeth him content, Whan of his boundys he hath þe terme went, And not desyreth ferther to procede, But stille abitte and wil it nat excede, Þat by ensa[m]ple alle womme[n] wolde Resten in on, as duelly thei schulde, And holde hem peyde and stille þer abide. But vnsure fotyng doth hem ofte slide; For þei be nat content with vnite: Þei pursue ay for pluralite, So of nature to mevyng þei be thewed; Al-þou? amonge, by signes outward schewed, Þei pretende a maner stabilnes; But vnder þat is hid þe dowbilnes So secretly, þat outward at þe eye Ful harde it is þe tresoun to espie. Vnder curteyn and veil of honeste, Is closed chaunge and mutabilite; For her desyr is kepte ful cloos in mewe; And þing þei hadde leuest for to sewe, Only outward for to haue a laude, Þei can decline with feynyng and with fraude. Wherfore, Cethes, þi wit was to bareyne, Þat þou aforne by prudence naddist seyne What schulde folwe of þis vnhappy caas. Whi wer þou bolde for to suffre, allas, Þin owne dou?ter, so fair and fresche of hewe, With straunge gestis entred but of newe, So folily for to lete hir dele! Wher-þoru? þin honour, þi worschip, &amp; þin hele Was lost in haste, and sche to meschef brou?t, In straunge londe, with sorwe and myche þou?t. Wher as sche to grete sclaunder of þe, In gret miserie and aduersite An ende made; and þou wer lefte al sool. Þou my?test wel compleyne and make dool. Allas þe while, ?if in þi prudent sy?t Þou haddest grace to remembre ari?t, And to haue cast by discret purvyaunce, And weied wysely by mesour in balaunce Þe fraude of wommon, and þe fre[e]lte; In whom ful selde is any sikerte, As in [his] latyn Guydo dothe expresse. Wherfor, þou Cethes, of verray reklesnesse Þou hast attonys, in augment of þi woo, With-out recure bothe two for-goo: Firste þi tresour, and þi dou?ter dere, Þat was to þe so passyngly entere, And eke þin ayre; for whan þat sche was goon, As seithe myn auctor, other was þer noon, After þi day for to occupie Þi royal septre, nor þi lond to guye. But what was worþ þe gret[e] prouidence, Þe wakir kepyng, or besy diligence Of my?ti Mars, þat god is of bataile— What my?t it help, diffende, or availe Ageyn þe wit of womman, or þe slei?te; Whos fraudes arn of so huge a wei?te, Þat as hem list ay þe game gothe, Her purpos halt, who so be lefe or lothe— Þei ben so sli?e, so prudent, and so wyse! For as þis story plainly doth devise, Þis Medea by hir engyne and crafte, From hir fader his tresour hath berafte Þoru? þe werchyng of hir slei?ty gyle, As ?e schal her with-Inne a lityl while. For as sche sat at mete in þat tyde, Next hir fader, and Iason by hir syde, Al sodeinly hir fresche rosen hewe Ful ofte tyme gan chaunge and renewe, An hondrid sythe in a litel space. For now þe blood from hir goodly face Vn-to hir hert vnwarly gan avale, And þere-with-al sche wexe ded and pale; And efte anoon, who þat can take hed, Hir hewe chaungeth in-to a goodly red. But euere amonge tennwen hir colour, Þe rose was meynt with the lillie flour; And þou? þe rose stoundemele gan pase, ?it þe lillie abideth in his place Til nature made hem efte to mete. And þus with colde and with sodein hete Was Medea in hir silfe assailled, And passyngly vexed and trauailed. For now sche brent, and now sche gan to colde, And ay þe more þat sche gan beholde Þis ?ong Iason, þe more sche gan desyre To loke on hym, so was sche sette a-fire With his bewte and his semlynesse; And euery þing sche inly gan enpresse, What þat sche sawe, bothe in mynde &amp; þou?t, Sche al enprente[t]h, and for-gat ri?t nou?t; For sche considereth euery circumstaunce Bothe of his port, and his gouernaunce: His sonnysshe here, crisped liche gold wyre, His kny?tly loke and his manly chere, His contenaunce with many noble signe, His face also, most gracious and benigne, Most acceptable vn-to hir plesaunce; For, as sche þou?t, it was suffisaunce, With-outen more, vn-to hir allone, To considre and loke on his persone. For in þat tyme, with-outen any drede, Of mete or drinke sche toke but litel hede; For sche of food hath loste hir appetit, To loke on hym sche hath so gret delite, He was so prented in hir remembraunce. Loue hath hir cau?t so newli in a traunce, And y-marked with his firy brond, Þat sche may nou?t eskapen fro his hond, Nor eschewe his strok in special; For sche was ?olde body, herte, and al, Vn-to Iason, platly for to seye, And euere among on hym sche cast hir eye, Whan þat sche fonde a leyser oportune. But of wisdam sche wolde nat contvne Hir loke to longe, list men dempte amys; But as þe maner of þis wommen is, Sche kepte hir cloos and wonderly secree, Þat by hir chere no man my?t[e] see What þat sche ment, by noon occasioun. Sche put hem out of al suspeccioun; For openly þer was no tokne sene. Sche cast[e] rather þat men schulde wene Þat þenchesoun of hir abstinence, And why þat sche satte so in silence— How þat it was only of wommanhede, Of honest schame, and of chaste drede, Þat to-gidre in hir hert[e] mette; Þe whiche tweyn so þis maide lette Fro mete and drink, as it wolde seme. Þus of wisdam sche made hem for to deme, And so to cast in hir opinioun; And þus sche blent hem by discrecioun; For hir chere koude euery þing excuse. Sche ?af no mater folis for to muse, No cher vnbridled þat tyme hir asterte; For þer was oon enclosed in hir herte, And another in her chere declared. For maidenes han ofte sythes spared To schewen oute þat þei desyre in dede, As it falleth, who so can take hede; Þat whil þei flouren in virginite, And for ?outhe haue no liberte To specifie þat her hert[e] wolde, Þei kepe hem cloos, for þei be nat bolde To schewen out þe somme of her sentence. And þus Medea, kepyng ay silence, Ne lete no worde by hir lippis passe, But couertly with sobre chere and face, What sche ment scheweþ with hir Eye So secretly þat no man koude espie Þe hoote fire in hir breste y-reke; And in hir self ri?t þus sche gan to speke, As sche in sothe þat so moche can: “So wolde God, þis ?onge lusty man, Whiche is so faire and semly in my si?te, Assured were to be myn owne kny?te. Whiche is to me most plesaunt and entere, With berd y-sprong, schy[n]ing liche gold were, So wel I-lemed, and compact by mesure, Wel growe on hei?te, and of gode stature; And lyketh me in euery part so wel, Þat by assent of Fortune and hir whele, I ewred were to stonden in his grace. For as me semeth, on his kny?tly face It is to me an heuene to by-holde, Al-be þer-with myn hert I fele colde; And ?it in soth it may noon other be. Allas! whi nadde he vp-on my wo pite, Or, at þe leste, he knewe in his entente, How moche trowth to hym þat I mente! Of whiche, allas, he taketh no maner hede, Al-be for hym I brenne as doth þe glede, And to be ded I dar me not discure. Alas! my pitous and woful aventure Is to rewful, and my mortal peyne, So to be mordred, and dar me not compleyne To frende nor foo of my chaunce, allas! To finden help or socour in þis caas. And trew[e]ly, ?it as I schal deuise, I no þing mene but in honest wise, Liche as it schal openly be fownde; For I desire to be knet and bounde With hym in wedlok, &amp; neuer fro hym twynne; For my menyng is with-owten synne, Grounded and set vp-on al clennes, With-oute fraude or any doubilnes— So clene and pure is myn entencioun!” Loo, ay þe maner and condicioun Of þis wommen, þat so wel can feyne, And schewen on, þou? þe[i] þink[e] tweyne; And couertly, þat no þing be seyn, With humble chere and with face pleyn, Enclose her lustis by swyche sotilte, Vnder [þe] bowndis of al honeste Of hir entent, þou? þe trecherie With al þe surplus vnder be y-wrye. And þou? þat þei feith a-forn pretende, And can her fraude with florissyng wel diffende, And flaterie, only þe worlde to blende, With dowbilnes enclosed in the ende, ?it ay deceyt is benethe ment, Vndre þe sugre of feyned clene entent, As it were soth, in verray existence; But, trust me wel, al is but apparence. Þei can schewe on, and another mene, Whos blewe is li?tly died in-to grene; For vnder floures depeint of stabilnes, Þe serpent dareth of newfongilnes. So pleyne þei seme with wordis fair[e] glosed, But vnder-nethe her couert wil is closed; For what þing be most vn-to þer pay, Þei wil denye and rathest þer swere nay. Þus liketh Guydo of wommen for tendite. Allas, whi wolde he so cursedly write Ageyn[e]s hem, or with hem debate! I am ri?t sory in englische to translate Reprefe of hem, or any euel to seye; Leuer me wer for her loue deye. Where-fore I preye hem to take in pacience; My purpos is nat hem to done offence; Þei ben so gode and parfyte euerechon, To rekne alle, I trowe þer be nat on, But þat þei ben in wille and hert[e] trewe. For þou? amonge þei chese hem lovis newe, Who considreth, þei be no þing to blame; For ofte tyme þei se men do þe same. Þei most hem purveie whan men hem refuse; And ?if I koude I wolde hem excuse. It sitteth nat a womman lyue alone; It is no stor but þei haue more þan oon. Preying to hem for to do me grace, For as I hope, to hem is no trespas Þou? my makyng be þe same in al, As Guydo wryt in his original— Where he mysseyth, late hym bere þe wyte; For it sit wel, þat þe vengaunce byte On hym þat so þis wommen haþ offendid; And ?if I my?t it schul[de] ben amendid. He schulde reseyue duely his penaunce; For ?if he died with-oute repentaunce, I am dispeired of his sauacioun, Howe he schulde euer haue remissioun, But he were contrite his synne to redresse; It may not ben, as clerkys bere wytnesse. And be my trouthe, and he were alyue— I mene Guydo—and I schulde hym shryue, So bitter penaunce pleynly he schulde haue, Þat to þe tyme þat he were I-graue, He schulde remembre, and platly not asterte For to repente hym with al his hol[e] herte, Þat he so spake to his confusioun. I wil no lenger make digressioun Fro my matere, but let Guydo be, And telle forþe þe worching of Medee, Þat hath licence of hir fader nome, And to hir chaumbre is allone y-come, Whan oute of halle with-drawen was þe pres, And whan Iason, and also Hercules, Liche as þe kyng after mete bad, To her chaumbres conveied wern and lad, Ful rially arrayed and beseyn; For euery wal was cured in certeyn With clothe of golde, in ful statly wyse. And in þis while, as ?e han herde deuise, Was Medea to hir chaumbre goon, Wher by hir silf, compleynyng euer in oon, Sche ?af issu to hir peynis smerte, Þat hir so sore han wounded to þe herte: For Loue haþ brou?t hir in a sodeyn rage, Þat was not likly sone for taswage; For in sothenes, þe furious god Cupide Hath swiche a fir kyndeled in her side, Þat it was neuer likly hir to lete, So violent and fervent was þe hete, Þat mor an[d] mor encresen gan hir peyne. For in hir breste þer was atwixe tweyne A gret debate, and a stronge bataille, So feruently eche other dide assaile; And þis contek, in ernes and no game, Iuparted was betwixe Loue and Schame, Metyng to-gidre þer at vn-set stevene, Al-be þe felde was nat parted evene. For Loue in soth, ful of hi?e renoun, Was bolde and hardy, liche a fers lyoun, And was nat ferful of spere, swerde, nor knyf, But hoot and hasty for to awnter his lif, Eke surquedous, stout, and ful of pride, Chefe champioun of þe god Cupide, Þat causeth ofte, bothe fre and bonde, Ful many pereil for to take on honde. And caused hath ful many mannes dethe, And many on to ?elden vp þe brethe, And made her woundes largely to blede; For of pereil Loue taketh noon hede, To gete hym honour by excellence of fame. But in contraire his enmy called Schame, Liche a coward, feynt and hert[e]les, As he þat neuer dar put hym self in pres, For lak of manhod drawiþ hym euer a-bak; He is so dredful and ferful of þe wrak, Lyche a childe, ?ong and tender of age; For he hath nouther herte nor corage For to assaille, he is so feble of my?te; And ?it ful ofte he hath stonde in þe si?te Of many louer, to let hym for to spede, Þoru? fals conspiring of his broþer Drede. For Drede and Schame, whan þei ben allied, Of on assent haue pitously denyed Vn-to Loue, herte and hardines, Þat he ne durst out a worde expres; For whan þat Loue of manhod wolde speke, Þe wode fire out of his brest to vnreke, Vp-on þe point whan he schulde assey, Cometh Schame anoon, &amp; outterly seith nay, And causeth Loue hornys for to schrynke, To [a]baische his chere &amp; pitously to wynke, Cowardly his cause to appeire. And þus is Schame froward and contrayre, Þoru? help of Drede, Lovis folk to fere. For dowt[e]les ?if Schame nou?t ne were— As it is kouþe, boþe ni? and ferre— Love in his lawes often schulde erre, And wynden out of honeste[e]s cheyne, Of his boundis bridel breke a reyne, Ry?t as an hors out of þe traise at large; For lite or nou?t louers wolde charge To folwe her wille, and her lust to sewe; But al þe while [þat] Schame is kept in mewe, Outward in porte Loue bereth hym lowe: Recorde of wommen, for þei þe sothe knowe. For ne were Schame, as clerkys han compiled, Out of her hertis daunger were exiled, Al straungenes and feyned fals disdeyne. For ne were Schame pleinly þe wardeyne Of þis wommen, by writyng of þis olde, With-out assaut þe castel were y-?olde; It were no nede a sege for to leyn: For in swyche case longe trete were in veyne; For of nature þei loue no processe. But now, allas, Drede &amp; Schamefastnesse Han daunted Loue, in ful lowe manere, And maked hym ful humble of port &amp; chere; And þei han eke by her violence, For al his manhod, put hym in silence, And ben gret cause of moring of his peyne. And amyddes of þis ilke tweyne, Of Loue and Schame even vp-on þe point, Stood Medea in ful gret disioynt, Þat sche ne may þe peyne nat endure, So hoot sche brent, þis woful creature, By-twyxe bothe—I mene Loue and Schame. For whan þat Loue wolde eny þing attame Of his desires to declare hem oute, Cam Schame anoon, and put him in [a] doute; And Drede was redy his lust for to denye. And þus sche stood in a Iupardye Of Loue and Schame, in maner of a traunce, Vn-euenly hanged in balaunce; For Schame was gret, &amp; Loue ?it was more, As sche wel knewe, by hir si?es sore, And by hir stormy cruel aventure. For Drede and Schame durst[e] not discure Þe fire þat Loue had in hir brest enclosed, Whiche was ful harde for to be deposed. And þus sche henge euen atwixe two, Þat sche ne wist what was best to do; Til þat Fortune with hir double face Vnhappily hath wrou?t to gete hir grace, With þe whirlyng of hir whele aboute, Þat causeth wrecches ful lowe doun to loute, Whan þei best wene to sitten hi?e alofte— Be experience, as men may sen ful ofte, By hir gery reuolucioun. For þis lady of transmvtacioun, Ful ofte tyme fals and ful vnstable, Enhasteth þinges to foolis ful greable, Whiche in þe ende, to her confusioun, Can vnder sugre schrowden her poysoun. For ay Fortune, as hir maner is, To wrechis scheweth oþir þan it is; For with fayr chere and face of flaterie— As sche þat can with a benigne eye Fully of folis parforme the entent, Wher-þoru? þei be in gret meschef schent At þe ende, and can no crafte [t]eschewe Þe vnwar harme þat at hir tail doþ sewe— Ry?t as it fel, whilom of Medee, Gynnyng and grounde of hir aduersite— For þis lady, þat called is Fortune, I-graunted hath a leiser opportune To schewe Iason hooly al hir herte, Whiche made hir after ful sore wepe and smerte. For on a day, after meridien, Whan Appollo with his bemys schene From þe southe plage gan to wester faste, Cethes, hir fader, hath y-sent in haste To Medea to com to hym anoon, And bad to hir þat sche schulde goon Vn-to Iason and [to] Hercules, To make hem chere amongis al þe pres. And whan sche cau?te opportune space To hir desire, and sawe eke in þe place, Þat hir fader was most occupied, As sche þat þou?te not to ben espied, Apparseyuynge his grete besynesse, Toward Iason anoon sche gan hir dresse; And he in haste with a ful kny[?]tly chere, In curteys wyse gan to drawe nere Towardis hir, &amp; sawe þer was no lette. And whan þat þei were to-gidre sette, Þis Medea with sy?ing first abreyde, And to Iason even þus sche seide: Howe Medea exorted Iason not to take vpon him þis iopardy to preve his manhode. And howe she delyverde him thre þenges for to distroy Martis ordynaunce. “Iason,” quod sche, “of þin hi?e noblesse, Of þi manhood and þi gentillesse, Bothe assembled in þi persone y-fere, And of kny?thod, first I the requere In þi conceyte and oppinioune Nat to arette to presumpcioun, To doubilnesse nor to inconstaunce Of wommanhed, nor to variaunce, Þat I am bold &amp; can for no þing spare My menyng clerly to ?ow to declare, With-oute feynyng, in wordis plat &amp; pleyn, Beseching firste, to þat þat I schal seyn, With-out[e] more, of ?oure goodlyhede Benyng[e]ly for to taken hede, And paciently to my wordes leste, And what I seye, to take it for þe beste In ?our entent, and no þing ?ou to greue. For þinges two myn hert[e] sore meve, Þis to seyne, loue and gentillesse, What þat I mene clerly to expresse To ?our persone, and no þing to concele Or we parte, liche as ?e schal fele. For me semeth, first of curtesye, In sothefastnes, and of gent[e]rye, Þat to straungeris euery maner wy?t Is bounde and holde of verray due ri?t To make chere, and trewly as for me, Be-cause, Iason, þat I in ?ow se So moche manhod, &amp; so gret worþinesse, I wil not feyne with al my besynesse To helpe and forther in al þat may ?ou like.” And with þat word of herte sche gan to syke, For his sake, and seide hym ouermore: “For ?ou I fele ful gret anoy and sore, Þat meved arn with-oute avisenesse, Only of ?outhe and wilful hardinesse Þe flees of gold to geten ?if ?e may; Þe whiche emprise, who-so-euer assay, More perillous is pleynly to acheue, In verray soth, þan ?e koude leue: For dout[e]les, I do ?ow wel assure, Þe final mede of þis auenture Is nat but deth, saue report of schame; For þer ?e wene to gete ?ow a name, Þe ende pleinly schal turnen in contrarie, Fro þe gynnyng so þe fyn schal varie. For wit of man, nouþer engyn nor my?t, Þou? he be neuer so wel expert in fy?t, Or haue in armys passynge excercise, With alle þe sle?tes of olde or newe emprise, Or þou? he be best breþed to endure, Or what deuis þer be of his armvre, Or what wepne also þat he brynge, Harded with stele, trenchaunde or persynge, ?it at þe last, whan he hath al sou?t, With-out[e] me it vaille may ri?t nou?t. Wherefore, Iason, I haue compassioun On ?our ?outhe, of pure affeccioun: Of wilfulnes ?e schuld[e] þus be lorn, Þat ben of blood and lyne so hi?e born; For certeynly it may noon other be, But ?if þat ?e ?our conseil take of me, For noon but I may do ?ow help or ese. Allas, Iason, whi wil ?e not appese ?our manly corage, in þis caas I-blent, And to my counseil ben obedient! Þan durst I swerne ?e schulde haue victorie, Ben remembred and put in memorie Perpetuelly, and þouru? ?our kny?thod wynne Þe flees of gold, þe whiche is ?ond with-Inne, In þe Ile þat stant here be-syde, Of whiche þat Mars is gouernour &amp; guyde. Wherfore attonis in ?our silfe assent, To my conseil fully to consent, At fewe wordis, ?if ?e list to spede, And leue ?our lust and wirke after my rede.” To whom Iason with [ful] humble chere, Answered and seide, “myn owne lady dere, I thanke ?ow in al my best[e] wise, Ri?t as ferforth as I may suffise, And as my power platly may atteyne, Myn hertis quene and lady souereyne; Whom þat ?e may hooly, I ensure, Al þe while þat my life may dure, Trusteþ ri?t wel, me list not for to feyne, To liue or dye, at ?our lust restreyne, As hym þat is ?our owne trewe man, ?ow for tobeye in al þat euer I can, With-oute chaunge or any doubilnes, While þat I lyve, in verray sothfastnes. Þat ?ow list of trewe affeccioun, Vp-on my life to haue compassioun, Of gentilnes, and [þat] ?e list to haue Swiche cherte my body for to saue, Þat in good feith, of verray due ri?t, I am y-bounde to be ?our owne kny?t Vn-to myn ende; and þat more specially Þat of ?our grace so benygnely ?e liste ?our silfe of my conseil be, Þat neuer aforn to ?ow in no degre Ne dide seruise to ?oure wommanhed; And with ?oure wordis ful of goodlyhed, ?our owne man listeth recomforte. Þe whiche in soth, so as I can reporte, A þousand folde be þe more plesaunt, Þat neuer a-forn no merit gat him graunt, Ne no decert, requeste, nor prayere; But more frely, with hert[e] ful entere, Liste vnrequered on my wo to rewe, And vndeserued ben to me so trewe, Þat I ensure vp-on my feith as faste, In ?our seruise I schal vn-to my laste Perseuere, sothly, þat þer schal be no slouthe, Nor variaunce, and þe[r]-to here my trouþe: For finally with-outen [any] wene, At fewe wordes, I seie ri?t as I mene, Me list not feyne, flatre, nor delude, For my behest with deth I schal conclude, Whan þat parchas my lyves thred to-rende; Þis al and som, and þus I make an ende.” “Þanne,” quod sche, “ful wysly in ?our herte ?e moste a-forn consideren and aduerte Þe auenture, þat ?e take on honde, And prudently þe pereil vnderstonde, And ful warly caste and haue in mynde Þe mortal harme at þe taiel be-hynde, Þat is wel more þan it is credible; For leue me wel, it is an impossible To gynne [in] honour, &amp; also for to fyne. For þilke flees be hi?e power devyne Preseruyd is, and eke with Martis my?t, Þat who-so entreþ þere for to fi?te, It wer ful harde [to] hym to eskape Þe firy flame, whan þe bolis gape, Þat ben of bras, trapped al in leuene, More for to drede þan li?tnyng of þe heuene To-fore þe dent of þe grete thonder, Þat seuered hath many tour assondre; For to assches þei moste a man consume. Wherfor I rede þat ?e nat presume Þe Ram tassaile, lest ?e ?our labour lese; With-drawe ?our foot ?it sithen ?e may chese, By good avise and discreccioun, ?our honour saue, and ?our hi?e renoun. Wher-so ?e list of ?our wilfullnes, Only of foly and of hastines To þis emprise of heed to procede, Or wher ?e list, liche as I ?ow rede, Sauen ?our silfe from wo &amp; al meschaunce, Liche as ?e schal, ?if to myn ordynaunce ?e ?ow committe, and lowly list obeye With-oute fraude—þer is no more to seie.” And Iason þan, sittyng at þe borde, Of Medea enprentyng euery worde, Wexe for Ire almost inpacient, And seide, “allas, [and] is þis ?our entent, Me to counseile to leue þis emprise? Certis it were to fowle a cowardyse, To gynne a thing I my?t[e] nou?t acheue; For euery man wolde me repreue, And report to my confusioun, Þat I of pride and presumpcioun Toke on me, whan I was at my large, So hi?e a þing, and so gret a charge, Þat I ne durst for drede of meschef Acomplisch it, whan it cam to [þe] pref. Leuere me were, myn owne lady dere, For to Iuparte and to putte in were My life attonys, and, at wordes few, On smale peces to ben al to-hewe, Þan I schulde cowardely for-sake Þilke emprise þat I haue vnder-take, As ?e wel knowe, and leue it þus, allas! Let be ?oure counseile pleynly in þis cas; For what-so-euer happe or falle of me, Trusteþ ri?t wel, it schal noon other be. For ?if þat I, of my cowarde herte, Fro my purpos schulde nowe diuerte, With-oute laude my life I schulde lede, And schame eternal schulde be my mede Þoru?-oute þe worlde noted oueral, In euery lond spoke of in special, Þat Iason hath so hi?ly vndirtake, Þat he for fere dar noon ende make. Þinketh ri?t wel, it schal not betide, For life nor dethe what meschef I abide; And þer-vpon my trouthe: I ?ow ensure, Þat as ferforthe as my life may dure, I schal parforme þat I haue begonne; And þou? so be, it may not be wonne, But þat I moste with my dethe it bye, I wil not leue, for leuer I haue to dye Þan lyue aschamed of cowardyse &amp; slouthe. For me semeth, it is to hi?e a routhe A man to apere or dore schewe his hede After tyme whan his worschip is ded, Or to lyue whan his name is slayn; For euery man schulde be rather fayn To dye in honour, þan lyuen as a wreche; And þou? þis þing to my deth now streche, It is welcom, I schal it wel abide: Þis al and som, what so of me betide.” “Þan,” quod sche, “sythen it is so, Þat ?e algatis desyre to haue a-do, Þer is no more by ou?t I can espie, But ?e haue leuer schortly for to dye, Rather þan lyue and to haue a schame; And ?it it is an ernes and no game, With suche monstres vnwarly for to dele, Lyche as in dede her-after ?e schal fele. Wherfor I am meved of pite, And gretly stered, þat ?e of volunte, With-out avis or discrecioun, Counseil or good deliberacioun, List take on ?ow þis merveillous viage; For ?our ?outhe and also ?our corage Gouerned ben, as in þis matere, Al after luste; for bothe two I-fere Iuparted ben, ?if ?e ?our purpos swe; For impossible is to ?ow teschewe A sodeyn deth, for nouþer fre nor bonde By craft of man hath power to with-stonde. Wherfor I þinke of herte and good entent To cast a weye, ?it or ?e be schent, And to ?our Iorney schape a remedie, Swiche rauthe I haue þat ?e shulde dye; For my fader, whom I loue moste, Rather þan ?e schulde þus be loste, I schal offende, and outerly displese My frendes alle, so it may do ?ow ese. For I schal fynde swyche a mene weye, At þe leste þat ?e schal nat deye; For in þis cas, I thinke be ?our guyde, So þat for ?ow I schal sette a-syde My birth[e] first, of þe stoke royal, And ouermore myn heritage with-al, And myn honour schal be putte a-bak ?ow for to helpe, þat þer schal be no lak Founden in me, so ?e wil be kynde, And þat ?e liste for to haue in mynde As I disserue goodly me to quite, Consyderyng firste þat it is not a lite To saue ?our life, þat stant in iupartye More perlously þan ?e can espie. But for al þis, I schal it so ordeyne, Þoru? my crafte, only atwixe vs tweyn, Þat or we parte I hope al schal be wel: Vp-on þis point so þat I may fele, Feithfully for Ioye, wo, or smerte, With ful acorde of body, wille, and herte, To my desire þat ?e condiscende, I vndirtake to maken a good ende.” “?is, sothly, lady,” seide Iason tho, “I am assented, with-oute wordes moo, For to fulfille with euery circumstaunce What þat euer may be to ?ow plesaunce.” “Þanne,” quod sche, “þer is no more to seyn— But first of al, with feith &amp; herte pleyn, With al ?our my?t, and ?our besy cure, And menynge hool, þat ?e me assure Þat ?e her-after schal take me to wyve, To holde and kepen after al ?our lyve, So þat ?our dede acorde with ?our heste; Þis is þe fyn and somme of my requeste: Excepte only þat ?e shal ordeyne, In ?our repeire to ?our fadres reigne, Þat feithfully ?e schal me with ?ow lede; And after þat, whan þat ?e succede After his day in-to ?our heretage, With herte ay oon, and with o corage, ?e schal to me ben y-lyche trewe, And cherische me for chaunge of any newe, Liche myn estate, with-oute variaunce, And while ?e liue han in remembraunce My kyndenes in ?our grete nede. For þer is noon alyue þat may spede, Creature þat is here mortal, For to assaille þe forcys marcial Of þe dragoune and bolis, bothe I-fere; But it so be of me þat he lere Hooly þe maner how he schal hym guye, Liche as to ?ow I thenke specifie, Whan it happeth þat we mete ageyn; For noon but I may helpen, in certeyn, In þis cas, as platly ?e schal fynde, And I not aske but þat ?e be kynde.” “Sothly,” quod Iason, “al þis schal be do As ?e deuise, I wil þat it be so; And here my faith, þer-on I ?ow assure, O goodlieste of any creature Þat euere ?et I saie vn-to my paye, And fairest eke, in soth it is no nay— And of bounte ?e ben incomperable; For of my deth ?e ben so merciable, Þat while I live, I seie ?ow be my feith, Myn hert[e] menyth as my tong[e] seith, I wil be founde ?our owne trew[e] man For life or deth, in al þat euer I can; So þat of grace it be ?ow plesaunt For to parforme ?our hestis and ?our graunt, And werche fully to my sauacioun, As ?e han seide, in ful conclucioun. For trewly ?e, of alle þat bere life, In bewte han a prerogatyfe, Passyng echon, me liste not for to glose, Amongis flouris as doth þe rede rose, Which in somer amyd þe herbes swote, After þat ver hath made oute of þe rote Þe humydyte kyndely tascende, Þe bareyn soyl to clothen and amende, And þe braunchis, þat wynter made bare, With soote blosmys freschly to repare, And þe medwes, of many sondri hewe, Tapited ben with diuerse flouris newe, Of sondry motles, most lusti for to sene, And holsomm bawme is schad among þe grene— Ri?t as þe rose is fairest of echon, Ri?t so Nature sette ?ow allon, Whan sche ?ow made, first at hir deuys, Above alle other for to haue a pris, As ?e þat be of bewte spring and welle. Þer-to in bownte sothly ?e excelle Alle þat lyven, for no comparysown Ne may be made; and of discrecioun ?e passen alle, as euery man may se. And with al þis I fynde ?ow [vn-]to me Þe most goodly þat euer ?it was born, With-out whom I were as now but lorn, Of helpe and socour fully destitut, Ne were þat I founde in ?ow refute. Fro whom al fredam to-me-ward doþ abounde, In so moche þat I am euer bounde As ferforthe as my lyfe may streche, Þat for ?our sake of deth I ne recche, ?if þer-with-al I my?t[e] ?ow agreen, Þat to my helpe so goodly list to seen. For ?if þat I of necligence schulde Any þing refusen þat ?e wolde, I my?t of resoun ful wel marked be, And noted eke, of wilful nycete So folily to voyde away my grace. It were a rage a man from hym to chase Welful Fortune, whan sche is benigne; Wherfor as now hooly I resigne Herte, body, my life, and eke my deth In-to ?our hond, while me lasteth brethe, With alle þe othes þat I afferme may, For to perseuere to myn endyng day ?our trew[e] spouse, as I haue said and sworne, And ?ou behested pleynly her-to-forne; And her-vppon, euery þing obeie Þat may ?ou plese, til tyme þat I deye. Þis al and som; what schulde I lenger tarie? From þis byheste I schal neuer varie.” And whan sche sawe his grete stedfastnes, Sche was supprised with so hi?e gladnes, With so gret Ioye, pleynly in hir herte, Þat sche was voide of euery wo and smerte; For he so lowly to hir luste obeyde. And or sche went þus to hym sche seyde: “Iason,” quod sche, “þan I schal ordeyne A mene weye þat we bothe tweyne May efte ageyn at leyser mete sone, For to parforme al þat is to done In þis mater, liche to oure entent, Wher schal be made a fynal sacrament Of oure desire, þat no man schal vnbynde, Þou? now þer-to we may no leyser fynde. Toward euen, It schal me not eskape, Trust me ry?t wel, a tyme for to schape, Secrely þat we [may] mete y-fere; For I schal sende a privy chaumberere To ?ou of myn, whyche schal ?ou conveye Vn-to my chambre by a privy weye, A certeyn hour, with-outen any fable, To oure entent þat be moste greable: Vp-on þe point whan Phebus with his li?t I-westrid is, and þe dirke ny?t Hath with þe dymnes of his schadowes blake Our Emysperie fully ouertake, Þat ofte ?eueth by fauour of fortune Vn-to louers a leyser oportune For to parforme her lustis and acheve. And ri?t anoon, as it draweth to eve, I schal for ?ow to my closet sende, Of euery þing for to make an ende; Wher as we schal at good leyser speke Eueryche with oþer, and our hertis breke, And declare þe somme of al oure wille. And whan we han spoken al our fille, By good leyser, I fully ?ou behete, We schal ordeyn whan so vs list to mete, To sette a tyme, who-euer þat seye nay, Alweye be ni?t, whan passed is þe day. For my?ti Iove as wysly me socoure, As hens-forthe I wil ben hoolly ?oure, While þat I live, wakyng and a-slepe, ?if it so be þat ?e ?our hestis kepe.” To whom Iason lowly gan tencline, And seide, “as fer as man may ymagyne, Or any wit may clerly comprehende, I wil to ?ou, to my lyves ende, As a seruaunt feithfully me quyte; And þou? þat I can nat seyn but lite, My trew[e] herte wilneþ neuer-þe-lesse; And þou? I can not paynt[e] nor compasse No gay prosses, my souereyn hertis quene, Til I be ded, trewly I schal mene; Hath her my trouþe whil I haue life &amp; mynde, As in þe ende trewly ?e schal fynde.” And of her speche an ende þus þei make. And Medea schope hir for to take Hir leue anoon amonges al þe pres, First of hir fader and þan of Hercules, And bod no lenger, but furþe-with anoon Vn-to hir chambre in hast[e] sche is goon, Where vp and down sche made many went, Noon of hir meyne wetyng what sche ment, Castynge weyes hir purpos to acheve, And in hir wittes gan besely to meve, As sche rometh in hir habitacle, On any syde ?if þer were obstacle Or any lettyng, whiche wolde hir sore greue. Þis was hir studie til it drowe to eue, Where I hir leue compleynyng in her wo, With many a thou?t, walkynge to and fro. Þe mydday hour is goon and ouerslide, Titan so fast hath in his chare I-ride, Þe dayes arke from est to west compassid, His fery stedis han almost I-passed Our ori?onte, and drawe doun ful lowe His golden wayn, þat no man my?t[e] knowe Where as he hidde his fyry bemys bri?t, In his discence ful fer out of oure si?t; And Herynes, with hir copis myrke, Þe heuenyng be-gonne for to dirke, In þe twyli?t whan þe day gan fade; And Esperus, with hir stremes glade, Þat bene so fresche so lusty, and so mery, Gan recounforte al our emesperie: Whan Medea by hir silf allone, Of hi?e desire gan to make hir mone, Þat sche so longe abood after hir kny?t, Alweye acountyng þe houres of þe ny?t, So ful of trouble and so ful of þou?t, Which hath ful streytly cerched out &amp; sou?t A redy weye vn-to hir purpos, Al-be þat sche kept it in ful cloos Amyd hir herte, quappyng as a wawe For drede and fere, til hope gan a-dawe, And bad sche schulde be ri?t mery and glad, Til drede a-geyn-warde made hir sober &amp; sad Liste hir desire troubled were or let. And þus sche was at a-bay I-set Amyd of hope and of drede also, Þat sche ne wyste what was best to do: For hi?e desire and affeccioun So sore brent in hir oppinioun, Of lust sche hadde to meten with Iason, And þer ageyn[e]s drede cam in anoon, And made hir ferful list sche were espied. But al hir sorowe was holp and remedyed Only by Fortune and þe dirke ny?t, By whiche sche was made ful glad &amp; li?t. For recounforted only with þise two, And with good hope þat made hir glad also, Sche gan anoon to casten and deuise, Whanne þat þe mone on heuen wolde aryse, And whanne þat sche, with hir hornys pale, Wolde schede hir li?t vp-on hil and vale, Sche gan acounte and cast[e] wel þe tyme, And fonde a quarter was passid after pryme, As sche þat was wel knowyng in þat arte, And sawe in soth þat þe ferþe parte Of þe mone was schad with new[e] li?t, And passed was in hir cours ful ri?t, After þe tyme of coniunccioun, Thre signes ful by computacioun, And complete was seuen daies of hir age. At whiche tyme sche, brynnyng in hir rage, And þoru?-darted with Cupides arowe, Gan to loke and beholde narwe At euery dore, and listen besily ?if any wy?t þat sche my?t espie Of al þe courte ouþer walke or goo, Or any man romyng to and froo, So sore sche dradde, goyng vp and dovn, Whan sche herde ouþer noyse or sown, Or whan sche heryth wispring eny-where; It was venym sothly in hir ere: Sche wisched al hadde ben a-bedde. Þis pitous life þe longe ny?t sche ledde, With-out respit, þou? no wy?t koude it knowe, Til hi?e mydny?t þat þe cokkes crowe; At whiche tyme, w[h]an al was hust and stille, For to [a]complische þe remnaunt of hir wille, And euery-where maked was silence, Sche cleped anoon vn-to hir presence An aged vekke, fer in ?eris ronne, Þat in swyche crafte mochel help[e] konne, Thriftely to bring a þing a-boute. For þei a-forne can casten euery doute; Of ?eris passed olde experience Hath ?oue to hem so passyng hi?e prudence, Þat þei in loue alle þe slei?tes knowe; And sche was made as dogge for þe bowe. To whom Medea discureth al hir þou?t From point to point, &amp; for-gat ri?t nou?t, And charged hir, in reles of hir smert, And recomfort of hir troubled hert, To hasten hir anoon vp-on hir weye Vn-to hir chambre Iason to conveye. And sche anon, not rekles in þis cas, Is goon for hym a ful softe pas, As sche þat was of newe nat to lere, And brou?t hym forth anoon as ?e schal here. Howe Medea sent for Iason to com to Here in þe night, And howe he was sworn to wed here, aftire þe lawe of his panym rite. Whan þat þe cok, comoun astrologer, Þe mydny?t hour with his vois ful clere Be-gan to sowne, and dide his besy peyne To bete his brest with his wyngys tweyne, And of þe tyme a mynute wil not passe To warnen hem þat weren in þe place Of þe tydes and sesoun of þe ny?t, Medea to awayte vp-on hir kny?t Ful redy was þe entre for to kepe, As sche þat list ful litel for to slepe, For þat ne was no parcel of hir þou?t. And whan Iason was to hir chambre brou?t, With-out espying of eny maner wi?t, Þan sche anoon conveyeth hym ful ri?t In-to hir closet, in al þe hast sche may, Ful wel beseyn with gret and riche araye, Where by hir side sche made hym take his se. And first of alle, þis ilke lees of thre, By hir þat was moste expert in þis cas, Was sodeynly turned to a bras; For þe vekke to stare vp-on þe mone Is walked out, and [haþ] hem lefte allone. And whan Medea þe dores hadde schet, Down by Iason anoon sche hath hir set. But first I fynde, with al hir besy my?t, Aboute þe chamber þat sche sette vp li?t Of grete torches and cyrges ful royal, Aboute on pilers and on euery wal, Whiche ?af a li?t, liche þe sonne schene. And to a cheste, wrou?t of cristal clene, First of al, sche taketh hir passage, Out of þe wiche sche toke a rich ymage Of pured gold, ful lusty to beholde, Þat by custom of þis rytes olde To my?ti Iove, eterne and increat, I-halwed was, and also consecrat. Þe whiche ymage, deuoutly as sche ou?te, With humble herte to Iason first sche brou?te, And made hym lowly þer-on take his othe Vn-to his laste, ouþer for lefe or lothe, Þat he hir schulde take vn-to his wife Fro þat day forth duryng al his life, With hert vnfeyned and feith inviolat, And cherischen hir liche to hir estat. For to þat tyme, I fynde how þat sche Hadde euer floured in virginite; And as myn auctor wel reherse can, Ay kepte hir clene from touche of any man, In þou?te and dede, and neuer dide amys: For sche of herte so hool[y] ?ouen is Vn-to Iason, and þat for euer-mo. And he anoon hath put his honde þer-to, And sworne fully, as ?e han herde me say, Al hir requestes, with-oute more delay, To kepen hem whil his life may laste. But, o allas! how sone he ouer-caste His heste, his feith, with whiche he was assured, And hadde his fraude with flaterie y-cured So couertly þat hir Innocence, Hir trewe menyng and hir diligence, And al þat euer sche deuise can, Deseyved was by falshed of þis man! And þou? þat trouthe was apparent above, Doubilnes so sli?ly was in schoue, As þou? he hadde sothly ben allied With trewe menyng, &amp; so no þing espied Vnder faire chere was feynyng &amp; fallas. For what my?t sche ha wrou?t more in þis cas, Þan for þi sake, septre and regalye, And alle þe lordis eke of hir allye For-soke attonys, and toke of hem noon hede; And of pite and verray goodlyhede Loste hir frendes and hir good[e] fame, Only, Iason, to saue þe fro schame! And ?it, more-ouere, forsoke hir heritage— Sche þat was born of so hi?e parage, And schulde haue ben by successioun Eyre by dissent of þat regioun. But wommanly for sche wolde hir quite, Of al y-fere sche sette nou?t a myte, But at oon hour al sche hath forsake, And vn-to þe sche hath hir hooly take; Only for truste þou schulde[st] haue be kynde, Riches and honour sche hath y-left by-hynde, And ches in exil with þe for to goon, From al hir kyn, þis cely maide allone. Allas, I wepe for þin vnkyndenes! What, hath sche nat fro deth and fro distresse Preserued þe, and ?it þou takest noon hede, Þat schust a deyed, nadde sche ben þin rede! Of þi conqueste sche was þe verray cause! Þat I may nat, schortly in a clause, Writen hir bounte nor brefly comprehende, Effectuelly parformed to the ende, At wordes fewe it may nat be tolde. Þoru? whom þou hast þe riche flees of golde Manly conquered, whiche with-oute doute Vnlikly was the to haue brou?t aboute; For whan þou were of helpe destitut, Sche was þi counfort and singuler refut. And with al þis, þou maist it nat deneye, Al erthly honour how sche gan defye Þe to conserue out of heuenes; And hir fader sche hath of his riches So emporisched, þat pite is to here: Be exavmple of whiche, wommen my?t[e] lere How þei schulde truste on any man. Allas! Medea, þat so moche can Bothe of sterris and of astronomye! ?et sawe sche nat aforn hir destenye: Loue hadde hir put out of gouernaille, Þat al hir crafte ne mi?t her not availle. Sche was to slowe by calculacioun To cast a-forn the constellacioun Of hir birthe, and hir woful fate; For rekleshed sche sawe it al to late. But I suppose hir konnynge was fallible; For dout[e]les, me semeth nat credible, Þat ?if sche hadde wist of it to-fore, So pitously sche hadde nat be lore— As ?e schal seen here-after hastely, So as þe story reherseth by and by, Howe it be-fel of Iason and Medee. But first ?e schul þe ordre &amp; maner se How sche wrou?t after he was swore: Þe same ny?t, allas, sche hathe forbore Hir maidenhed, and þat was grete pite. And ?et sche ment nat but honeste; As I suppose, sche wende haue ben his wyfe; But touching þat, I holde as now no strife. And ?it o þing I dar afferme and seyne, Þat þe menyng of þis ilke tweyne Ne was nat on, but wonder fer atwene; For al þat sche trew[e]ly gan mene, Of honeste þinkyng noon outerage, Liche a maide Innocent of age, He to a-complische his fleschely fals delite And to parforme his foule appetite, Wrou?t euery þing to hir entent contrarie. Allas, þat sche was so debonaire For to trust vppon his curtesye, Or to quite hir of hir genterie, So hastely to rewe vp-on his smerte: But wommen ben of so tender hert, Þat þei wil gladly of routhe and pite, Whan þat a man is in aduersite, Sauen his life, rather þan he deye. And so Medea, schortly for to seye, Castyng no pereil after þat schal falle, His desyris and his lustis alle Hooly obeyeth, with al hir ful[le] my?t; And þat so longe almost þat þe ny?t Hath his cours rounde aboute goon. At whiche tyme to hir spake Iason, And lowly seide, “my lady, it is tyme Þat we arise, for sone it wil be pryme: ?e may se wel þe day begynneth springe, For we may here how þe briddes singe. Preying to ?ow in al my best[e] wyse, How I schal wirke þat ?e list deuise, And ceryously euery þing dispose, I ?ow beseche, O goodly fresche rose, Myn emprise to bringen to an ende; And þanne at erst, hen[ne]s wil I wende— Saue þat I þinke first with ?ou to trete In what wyse þis contre ?e schal lete, And in-to Grece repeire ageyn with me, Whiche is a londe of gret felicite. For trusteth wel, &amp; beth no þing in drede, In-to þat regne with me I schal ?ou lede, After my conquest, ?if so be þat I wynne. Wherfore, I praye ?ou goodly to begynne, How I schal werke, in al þe hast ?e may, For in good feith anoon it wil be day.” To whom sche spake, seying as ?e schal here: Howe Medea declarede to Iason the vertue of here relikis, and deliuerde þem to Iasone. “Myn owne Iason, vn-to me more dere Þan is my silfe, as in conclusioun, I am assented, with ful affeccioun Of my wittes, and [al] myn hool[e] herte, ?ou to enforme how ?e schal asterte Euery daunger of þe litel Ile, ?if it so be ?e list abide a while.” And vp sche ros, in al þe hast sche may, And to a cofre where hir tresour ley Sche went anoon, &amp; brou?t him in her honde A riche ymage of siluer þat sche fonde, Whiche sothly was of merueillous entaille, Whos power was and vertu to availle, Effectuelly to her bothe entent, Ageyn magyk and al enchaunt[e]ment, And to with-sitte þe force of sorcerye. For it was made be astronomye, In houre chose &amp; equat for þe nonys, By clerkis olde; for ful longe a-goon is, Whilom whan þei were flouryng in her ages, Þat þei vsede to make suche ymages, As dide þe kyng called Tholome. And so to Iason commaunded hath Medee To bere þis ymage on hym pryuely, As ?e han herd, to werche effectuelly In euery þing, as sche dide assygne. And þan sche toke to hym a medecyne Made in maner of an oyntement, To enoynte hym with, þat he be nat brent, Þat was more riche &amp; precious þan bame Ageyn þe malis of euery fire and flame. And after þat sche toke to hym anoon A riche ring, where-in was sette a stoon Þat vertu hadde al venym to distroye, Þat on no syde it my?t hym nat anoye. Þe whiche stoon hadde also þis my?t, Þat ?if a man coude it bere a-ri?t, With-Inne his honde next þe skyn enclosed, Þe strengþe of si?t schulde be deposed Of hem þat wolde gasen or biholde; For who-so-euer in his hond hit holde, By þe vertu þat was infallible, Þe story seith, he schulde be invisible. Þe whiche stoon wyse clerkis calle Achates, moost vertuous of alle; And it is founde sothly in Cecile. Of whiche stoon whilom wrot Virgile, How þat Venus to Eneas it sent First whan [þat] he in-to Cartage went. And after þis, sche to Iason toke A certeyn bille, writen liche a boke, Þat to his Iornay my?t[e] moche availle; And bad hym wisly þat he nat ne faille, ?if he cast hym graciously to spede, Firste of alle, þe scripture þat he rede, Or he þe Ram touche in any wyse; Hym chargyng eke, a-fore þis hi?e emprise, With humble herte and deuocioun, Þat he knelyng seye þat orisoun, Þat vp and doun was writen on þe bille, Preying þe goddys lowly to fulfille His request, and mercy for to haue, Of verray pite from meschef hym to saue. And after þat, for his chefe socour, Sche toke to hym a viol with licour, And bad hym manly with-oute fere or drede, Whan he come vn-to þe boles rede, ?if he hym schape kny?tely to eskape, Þat as faste as he seth hem gape, In-to her goles þat he þe licour caste. Þan dar hym not but litel of hem gaste; For her Iowes to-gidre it schal glewe, Þat on no syde þei schal not eschewe Tobeye his luste in what hym list constreyne. For, dout[e]les, maugre al her peyne, He schal hem so daunte &amp; make tame, Þat wher hym liste, in ernest or in game, He my?t hem make louten and encline, And don hem bowe boþe bak and chyne: Þe licour schal her chawlys so coharte, Þat asonder þei schal nat departe, For to offende or noyen any wy?t. And whan sche hadde þus vn-to hir kny?t In euery þing ?oue instruccioun, Pleyn doctrine, and informacioun How he schal skape þe daungeris by &amp; by, ?if he tak hede and werke avisely, And þanne acorded, þei þou?t[e] for þe beste For to parte, or men out of hir reste A-waked werne, for it drow to day, As þei wel seie by þe morwe graye. And list men hadde to hem suspecioun, Of hy?e prudence and discrecioun, Atwen þe tweyli?t and þe rody morwe Þe[i] toke her leue, with seynt[e] Iohn to borwe, With ofte kyssyng, as louers whan þei twynne; And so he went, and sche [is] lefte with-Inne, Beyng in hope to mete ageyn som day. And Iason þanne, as faste as euer he may, Gan ordeyn hym his Iorney to acheue, And þou?t he wolde anon go take his leue. And in what wyse, with-in a litel while, After þe maner of my rude stile, Mi purpos is, sothly, and nat spare, With ?our support pleinly to declare. Howe Iason requirede þe Kenge Cethes withoute delay to graunt hym to do his Armes in vinqwesshinge, if he myght, þe Flees of golde wrought by Martis ordynaunce. Whan þat þe rowes and þe raies rede Estward to vs ful erly gonne sprede, Evene at þe tweyli?t in þe daw[e]nyng, Whan þe larke of custom gynneth syng, For to salue in hir heuenly lay Þe lusty goddesse of þe morwe gray: I mene Aurora, þe whiche a-for þe sonne Is wont tenchase þe blake skies donne, And þe dirknes of þe dymme ny?t; And fresche Phebus, with comfort of his li?t, And the bri?tnes of his bemys schene, Hadde ouer-gilt þe hi?e hilles grene; And floures eke ageyn þe morwe-tyde Vp-on her stalke gan splaie her levis wyde, Whan þat Iason with al his companye Toward þe kyng ful fast[e] gan hym hy?e. Whom þat he fonde, liche to his estate, With septer in hond, ful pompus and elate, Hi?e in [þe] se of his regallie, Sittyng ful kyngly amyd his chiualrie, And his lordys abouten enviroun. At whiche tyme þis ?ong[e] champioun, Vnder a vowe stondyng of þe Ram, With sterne face to-fore þe kyng in cam, Beseching hym of his magnificence Þe same day to graunten hym licence To don his armys, and make no delaies, Concludyng playnly, þat at al assaies He wil þat day in þe felde be founde For to acheue, lyche as he was bounde Of olde beheste, and nat a poynt declyne, For lif nor deth, til he parforme and fyne Hooly þe auntres, vn-to þe fles þat longe, Þe kyng requeryng no lenger hym prolonge, But goodly graunt þe fyn of his emprise. And þanne þe kyng, in ful sobre wyse, Consideryng þe somme of his demaunde, To Iason spak and seide he schal commaunde Þat his requeste parformed be in haste— “Al-be,” quod he, “I am ful sore a-gaste, Of wilfulnes þou schust distroied be, List men þi deth arretten vn-to me, And þer-vppon wolde a blame sette, Of royal power þat I nat ne lette Þi manly ?outhe from swiche iupartie; Whiche were in soth a gret vilonye And preiudise to myn estat and name, Þat afterwarde men putte me in blame Þoru? false reporte &amp; wrong oppinioun, Þat I withstod not þi destruccioun. Wherefore, I rede ?it þou be avised, And my counseil lat nat be dispised; For bet it is, with honour in certeyn In-to þi contre to repeire ageyn, Þan wilfully for to take on honde A mortal þing þat no man may with-stonde. Þis is my rede, and fully myn avis, Take hede þer-to, sith [þat] þou art wys, List þou repente whan it is to late; And ?if so be þat þou wilt algate Þi purpos holde, and nat don as I rede, Almy?ti Mars I pray[e] þe to spede, Þe for to guye, what-so-euere falle; And eke I pray to þe goddis alle, Saffe and sounde þi body to restore— Þis al and som, of me þou gest no more.” And whan Iason had[de] herde þe kyng, Nat dismaied nor stonyed in no þing, In kny?tly wise dide hym reuerence, Þankyng hy?ly his royal excellence, Þat of his grace and benignite Vp-on his deth hym list to haue pite; Fully concludyng, touching his bataille, Þat nouþer red nor counseil may auayle, In no wyse his purpos to withdraw; But liche þe statute, pleynly, &amp; þe lawe, Ri?t as ferforth as Fortune wil hym Ewre, What so be-tide of his aventure, Settyng a-side euery fere and drede, Seide platly þat he wil procede For to parforme þat he hath vndertake— It wer in ydel mo skeles for to make, Or to allege more þer ageyn. And Iason þan, ful opunly and pleyn, Touching þe surplus of þis dredful þing, At his departyng seid[e] to þe kyng, In audience of his lordis alle: “What-so-ouer of me now be-falle, Or who-so-euer of malis þer-on mvse, To alle þe worlde, first, I ?ow excuse, And to þe goddis platly ?ow to quite, Thou? I deye, ?e be no þing to wyte, Ne no man schal [a]rette it ?ow of skele; For þat I wirke is frely at my wille, Ageyn þe avise of ?our hy?e prudence, And lif and deth, here in ?our presence, Holy of herte, and neuer for to flitte, To þe goddys and Fortune I committe, So as hem list for me to ordeyne, Ageyns whos wille I schal neuer pleyne, Nor hem nor ?ou putten in no blame What so betide, honour, Ioy, or schame, And of þis þing þus an ende I make, And for þis tyme of ?ou my leue I take, And of all tho þat aboute ?ou stonde.” And on by on he toke hem by þe honde. And [in] what wise forthe he gan hym dresse, To ?ou anoon I þinke to expresse. Howe Iason, aftire his leve take of þe Kenge, enterde þe Ille of þe golden Flees. Whan Titan had, with his feruent hete, Draw up þe dewe from þe levis wete, Toward mydmorwe, as I can diffyne, Vpon þe hour whan þe cloke is nyne, Iason ful manly and ful lyke a kny?t, Armed in steel, of chere ful glad &amp; ly?t, Gan dresse him forth, what hap þat euer falle, And seide adieu vn-to his feris alle, He in þe bot and þei vp-on þe stronde. And al allone, whan he cam to londe, And in þe water had his vessel lafte, He first of al remembring on þe crafte Of Medea, with al þe circumstaunces, And how he schulde kepe his obseruaunces In euery þing, and had it wel in mynde— And þanne anoon ful manly, as I fynde, He schope him forþe &amp; wente a kny?tly pas Toward þe bolis, þat forged wer of bras. But at þe point whan he his Iorne gan, For hym Medea wexe ful pale &amp; wan, So sore agast þat no þing my?t hir glade— A routh it was to se wat wo sche made: For þe teris on hir chekis tweyne, Ful pitously doun distille and reyne, Þat al for-dewed wern hir wedis blake. And ay þis sorwe sche made for his sake, Liche a womman ferful and in doute, While he his armys ful manly brou?t aboute. To sobbe &amp; sy?e sche can not ben in pees, List he for hast were ou?t rek[e]les, From point to point to don liche as sche bad. Þis was þe life þat sche for hym hath lad. And for to seen how he schulde hym defende, Sche gan anoon by greces to ascende, Of a tour in-to a hi?e pynacle, Wher as sche my?t haue noon obstacle, Nor lettyng nouther, for to han a si?te Of hym þat was hir owne chose kny?te. And euer among with wordis out sche brak, And stoundemel þus to hir silf sche spake: “O þou Iason, my souereyn hertis hele, ?if þou knewe what wo for þe I fele, Sothly, I trowe, it schul[d] þe nat asterte For to be trewe with al þin hool[e] herte, And God, I praye, þis Iourne at þe leste May þis tyme tornen for þe beste, And kepe þe sauf &amp; sounde in euery membre, And ?if þe my?t ffulli to remembre, As I þe tau?t, and in þe same forme, Euery þing fully to parforme, Only þis day þin honour to avaunce, Whiche for to sen wer al myn hool plesance: For certis, Iason, ?if þe fil ou?t amys, Fare-wel myn helþe &amp; al my worldly blis, And fare-wel þanne my myrthe &amp; my solace, And my welfare, my fortune, and my grace, And al attonys, myn hertly sufficiance!” Lo, þis for him was hir gouernaunce, From þe tyme þat he þe lond hath nome. And first of al, whan þat he was come Where as þe bolis, fel and dispitous, Out caste her fire &amp; flawme furious At her mowþes, wonder large and huge, Ageyn [þe] whiche, for his chefe refuge, Hym to saue þat he wer nat brent, He was enoynt with an oignement On his body, þat kepte hym fro damage Of þilke fire, þat was so ful of rage, And þe smokys, dirke and ful horrible, Whiche to eskape was almost impossible For any man, of what estat he be, With-oute comfort and conseil of Medee— By whos doctrine Iason can so wirke, Þat he is skapid from þe mystis dirke Of þe fire with his blases blake, Þat al þe eyre so cloudy dide make. Sche had hym made so discrete &amp; sage, Only by vertu of þilke ymage, Which þat he aboute his nek[ke] bare, Wher-by he was so prudent &amp; so war, Þat whan þe bolis han most fersly gaped, He hath her malis avisely eskapid. For thenfeccioun of hir troubled eyr He hath venquesched &amp; was in no dispeire; For in effecte, ageyn þe foule fvme, Þat wolde a man vn-to þe deth consvme, Þe ymage was a preseruatif, Hym to defende and to saue his life. And more surly to kepe hym oute of drede, Ful ofte sythe þe writ he dide rede; For þe vertu of þat orisoun Was vn-to hym ful proteccioun, Þat he nat fil in-to no distresse. And after þat, for more sikernesse, Hym to preserue in þis mortal caas, He toke þe licour þat in þe viol was, And þer-with-al, ful like a manly man, Al attonis, he to þe bolys ran, And for-gat nat so warly it to caste; And þer-with-al her chaules wer made faste, And by þe vertu so my?tely englewed, Þat he þer-þoru? hath outterly eschewed Þenfeccioun of þe smoky leuene. And whan þe eyr gan cleryn, &amp; þe heuene, And þe mystis wern waftid hym to-forn, With manly hert he rau?t[e] by þe horn Þe sterne bolis, and by violence He drowe hem forþe, in whom was no diffence, And ?oketh hem, so as þe maner was, And with þe plowe he made hem gon a pas, Nowe vp, now doun, and to ere þe lond. And at his lust so buxvm he hem fonde, Þat þe soil, smoþe, bare, and pleyn, Þei maked han redy to bere greyn, And on rengis it torned vp-so-dovn: For þo in hem was no rebellioun, But humble and meke &amp; redy at his wille, Alle his desires pleynly to fulfille. And Iason þanne, liche a champioun, Gan hym enhaste towarde þe dragoun, Þat was a beste gret and monstruous, Foule and horrible &amp; ri?t venymous, And was enarmed in skalis large and þikke, Of whom þe brethe more perillous and wikke Was þan þe eyr of any pestelence; For his venym was of swiche violence, Þat it was ful dedly and mortal. And at his þrote þer issed oute with-al A flawme of fire, as of a fournes mouthe, Or liche þe leuene þat dovn by þe southe Out of þe est is wont in tempest smyte: Ri?t so þe dragoun, sothly for to write, Out of his mouthe had a flawme blasid. Wher-of Iason first a litel masid Was in his hert of þat dredful þing, But whan þat he remembrid on his ring, Al fer and drede was leide a-syde &amp; goon; For in þat ring þe[r] was sette a stoon, Ful riche and noble and ri?t vertuous, Þe whiche, as techith gret Ysydorus, And myn auctor also, as I fynde, Most comovnly cometh out of Ynde, And mot be kepte chast &amp; wonder clene, And of colour surmounteth euery grene. Whos vertu is al venym to distroye, And to withstonde þat it may nat [a]noye, Of dragoun, serpent, adder &amp; of snake. And specialy, ?if þat it be take And yholden in þe opposyt Of any werm, even ageyn þe sy?t, With-oute abood, in sothe, he may not chese, Of his venym þe force he most[e] lese, How strong it be or violent of rage. But to þe stoon it doth ful gret damage; For whan he hath his vertu don, as blyue On pecis smale it gynnyth al to rive, And in it silf hool a-bit no while. For in þe londe þat called is Cecyle, Þer is a worme þat Bufo bereth þe name; And whan men wil of malis make him tame, And his venym outerly represse, Þei take a squille, myn auctor bereth witnes, Whan þei wil wirke, or a large canne, And in þe ende þis ston þei sette þanne, And lyne ri?t a-geyn þe wormes hed Þei holden it, til þat he be ded. For þat is sothly his vertu of nature, Þat no venym may lasten nor endure In þe presence of þis rich[e] stoon. And as I fynde, þis Bufo ri?t a-noon, Þoru? my?t þer-of bresteth even on tweyne, Only by kynde, whiche no man may restreyne. For þe goddesse þat called is Nature, Whiche nexte hir lord hath al þing in cure, Hath vertu ?oue to herbe, gras, and stoon, Whiche no man knoweth but hir silf allon; Þe causis hid ben closed in hir honde, Þat wit of man can not vnderstonde Openly þe my?t of hir wirkynge. And so Iason, by vertu of þis ring, And þoru? his ston, þat my?t him most avaunce, Hath þe dragoun brou?t vn-to vttraunce. In whom he fonde no maner resistence Hym to wit[h]stonde, force nor diffence, Nouther be venym nor noon oþer strif; Wherfor he hath berefte hym of hys life In manly wise, &amp; in þe felde outraied. And Iason þan, ful glad &amp; wel apaied, Hath with his swerd spent on him many [a] stroke, And leied on him as men hewe on an oke— His bri?t[e] squamys wern so harde &amp; dure, Þat wel onethe he ne my?t endure Hym to dismembre &amp; smyten of his hed. And þan anoon, in þe stede of sed, He gan his teth out of his hed arrace, And ri?t forþe-with, in þe silfe place, He gan hem sowe, liche as men do corn, Vp-on þe lond þat ered was a-forn. Of whiche sede þer sprang a wonder greyn, Bri?t armed kny?tes stondyng on þe pleyn, Þe whiche anon, with scharp[e] swerdis grounde, Eueryche gan oþer for to hurte and wounde, Til eche his felawe hath cruelly y-slawe: Þis of hir fate was þe fynal lawe, Þat noon of hem schulde be victorie Þe deth reioische of other by memorie; For alle y-fere þus þei made an ende. And after þis, Iason gan to wende Vn-to þe Ram with al his dilligence, In whiche he fonde no power nor diffence, No maner strife nor rebellioun, And my?tely þe Ram he draweth dovn, And sette on hond [vp-]on euery horn, And slowe it first, and þan he hath it schorn Out of his flees of gold so passyng riche, Þat in þis world þer was no tresour liche. And after þat he made no delay To take his bote in al þe hast he may, And roweth forthe in-to þe tother yle, Wher Hercules, al þe mene while, Vp-on þe brinke, with many another mo, Abod Iason til he hadde do. And euerychon I fynde þat as blive, Only for Ioye whan he dide aryve, Þei gan to þanke to her goddes alle, So graciously þat it hath y-falle, And þat þe flees he hath so kny?tly wonne, Þat schon as clere as þe somer sonne, Whiche þat he brou?t with hym vn-to londe, His feris alle abyding on þe stronde. Howe, aftire his conqueste, Iason was ressauide of Kenge Cethes with feynide chere into his Cyte. And whan Appollo of his daies arke Had in the west almost ronne his marke, And fast[e] gan downward to declyne, And on þe wawes ful watery gan to schyne; ?et or he was passed the Occian, Iason is comme with many a manly man Of his feris to þe presence of þe kyng, As he þat had acheved euery þing Whiche þat longeth to conquest of þe Ram. And Cethes þan, as sone as euer he cam, To make hym chere outward haþ him payned, Al-be in herte þat it was but feyned; For he was sori, with-outen any drede, Of þe expleyt and þe good[e] spede Of þis Iason, þat he þe flees hath wonne. But liche in soth as þees feyners conne, Whan þat hem list craftely compace To schewe outward a feithful trewe face, And þe venym enclosen hool with-Inne, As in menyng þere wer no maner synne, Ri?t so þe kyng with looke &amp; forhed clere Made vn-to Iason outward ri?t good chere, And gan to hym speke in wordis fewe, Of frendlyhed many signe[s] schewe, As þei he had his conqueste euerydel From point to point liked wonder wel, And ben ful glad þat he was so fortuned, Vn-to þe ende þat he hath contuned, And reioiseth in speche and countenaunce, Þat Fortune list hym so avaunce, And to his paleis gan goodly hym conveye, And day be day ful richely festeye— Al-be þat it was no þing do of herte. For þis no lees, he felt[e] ful gret smerte, Þat of his tresour he was dispoiled so, And þat he hath þe riche flees for-go To his damage and confusioun. And þus þer was a gret diuisioun A-twexe his chere and menyng of his þou?t, As it fareth ofte ?if it be wel sou?t, Þat many man, in menyng fals and double, Can with þe calme curen so þe trouble Of hi?e malis hid in his desire, And rake falsly þe wikked couert fire, Ful hoot[e] brennyng inward of envye. So wel wer him þat coude hem oute espie, And knewe her menyng false &amp; fraudelent, Wher-þoru?, allas, ful many an Innocent Deseyved is, þat wote not what þei mene; And namly swiche þat nat but trouþe wene; And euery chere þat men to hem make, Of Innocence for þe beste take, And in no wise þenke nou?t but wel: Ri?t so certeyn þis Iason euerydel Hath take in gre what þe kyng hath wrou?t, Not aduertyng þe grucching of his þou?t; For dout[e]les it sat þe kyng ful sore, Þat he þe Ram hath lost for euere-more. But whan þat he hath outterly yseyn, Þou? he gruche, þat þer was no geyn, But finally, of necessite, At þat tyme it my?t noon other be, And pleynly sawe þat he may not chese, But þat algate þe flees he mot[e] lese, Wheþer it were þat he were lefe or lothe, He feyneth chere, as he wer not wrothe; For only he, of his gentilnes, No signe outward of gruching dide expresse, But day be day of verray curtesye He cherith Iason and his companye. At whiche tyme, abouten environ From euery party of his regioun, Þe peple cam to staren and to gase Vp-on þe Ram, as it were a mase; Þei loke &amp; wondre &amp; deme what hem liste, On whos domys is but litel triste: Þey ofte varie and torne to and fro, Þat, who þat wisly taketh hede þer-to, Þe comoun peple chaungeth as a phane, To-day þei wexe and to-morwe wane, As doth þe mone, þei be so flaskysable, Who trusteth hem schal fynd hem ful vnstable. For somme wer glad þat Iason hath sped wel, And some sory, and like it neuer a del, And somme seide þei wonder how he my?t Ageyn þe dragoun or þe bolis fi?t, Or how þat he ageyn þe force of Marte Out of þe yle alyue my?t[e] parte. A-nother seide þat parauenture By crafte was wrou?t þis discomfeture, Outher by charme or som sorserye: Þus eche of hem after her fantasie Gan deme of hym al þe longe day. But at þe last, makyng no delay, Ful glad and li?t Medea doun descendeth From hir chambre, &amp; outwarde pretendeth Sadnes of chere, as sche no þing ne knewe. Men koude nat conseyve by hir hewe Hir secre menyng, for sche so wommanly Demened hir, and so prudently, Þat sche avoyded by discrecioun Al fantasye and suspecioun, Þat no man koude of hir wirkyng deme No þing but wel; for as it dide seme, By port &amp; chere þer was no cause why. And so by processe sche drowe hir priuely Toward Iason, for sche was not to lere, And secrely bad hym in hys ere, In al wyse þat he not ne leue To hir chambre for to come at eue; For maters þei hadde for to trete, Whiche he schal know at leiser whan þei mete. And so anoon, whan entred was þe ni?t, Sool by hym silfe, with-oute torche or li?t, To Medea he hath þe weye take, And sche abood sleples for his sake, Wonder deuoutly desyryng, as I gesse, With hym to trete of som holynes, Touching maters of contemplacioun; For sche was smete with a deuocioun Of fresche Venus to holden a memorie With hym allone in hir oratorie— Not openly as ypocrites preye In diuers angles Ioynyng on þe weye, Of þe peple [for] to be comendid; But þei not so han þe ny?t dispendid For veynglorie nor noon ydel laude, But by hem silfe, þinkyng on no fraude, Secrely þis ilke tweyne allone, With-oute li?t ouþer of sonne or mone, Þe long[e] ny?t han lad with-oute reste: For as hem þou?t it was not for þe beste To speke of slepe til þat it was prime, For þei hem cast to lose as þo no tyme. And þus þe ny?t to-gidre þei dispende, Þat I am dul for to comprehende Þe obseruaunce of swiche religious, Prolix in werkyng &amp; not compendious— Demeth ?our silfe, ?e gete no more of me, For wel ?e wote, in euery faculte Who hath knowyng and experience, Men wil to hym raþest ?if credence. Wherfore I seie, ?e þat be wyse and can, Axeth not me, whiche am so rude a man, To deme a þing, &amp; namly whan þat it Passyth my knowyng also and my witte; For-dullid is myn ymagynatif, To deme in practik or in speculatif, Where-fore I passe and late it ouer slyde, And forþe I þink, ?if ?e list abide, Pleynly tellen of Iason and Medee. Þe whiche acorded and assented be, Þat sche with hym schal in-to Grece wende Whan þat he goth, schortly þis þe ende, Vnwist hir fader &amp; euery other wy?t Saue he allone, þat hath his trouþe pli?t For to be trewe, boþe in wele and wo, Vn-to his laste, to hir and to no mo. Howe Iason stalle away by nyght withe Medea and here Faderes tresure &amp; Richees. And whan Iason after his Iourne, Ful richely, liche to his degre, Refresched was in Colchos of þe kyng With al þat my?t[e] ben to his likyng, And a moneth passed was and goon, He with his Grekys assented in-to oon, Purposed hath, schortly ?if he my?t, With Medea to stele a-weye be ny?t, With moche tresour and þe riche flees, And ful acorde also of Hercules. But o Medea! þou hastest al to faste, Þou wer to slowe wysly for to caste What schulde falle, whan þou þi Iourne toke! For how þat he in meschefe þe forsoke, And how þat he was false and eke vnkynde, For alle his othes to þe, as I fynde, And how þat þou, bothe at eve and morwe, Þi fatal chaunce and þi pitous sorowe By-weptist after, &amp; gan þi silf to rende, Til deth of al made a woful ende— It wer but veyn to makyn rehersaille; I wote no þing þat it my?t availle, Nor how Iason vnkynde for þe nonys, Resseived hath penam tallionis Of þe goddis for his disnaturesse; For he in meschef and in wrechednesse Made eke an ende þoru? þe cruel hate Of fel[le] Mars: lo here þe mortal fate Of þis tweyn þat made her ende so! But as I trowe, liche as write Guydo, For her gynnyng was nat vertuous, An ende folweth ful contagious. Allas! þei hadde take hedde a-forne, Þan had þei nat in meschef ben so lorne. But who wil not a-forn his meschef se, May not eschewe to haue aduersite In þe ende, platly to devyne; For euene liche as a medicine Availeth nat, whan þe seke is ded: For what may helpen þe stomak or þe hed Letuarie, emplastre, or pocioun, Or any receyt or confeccioun, Herbe or stoon, or al þat leches knowe, Whan þat þe cors is leied in erþe lowe, Or whan a beest is torned to carein! Myn auctor seiþ, þat it is but veyn, For his recure, vp-on any halve, To his ere for to leyn a salve: For verraily, after his fantasye, It helpeth nat, nor doth no remedie; For þing parformed in his due date More vertu haþ þan whan it commeþ late. Ri?t so in cas, verraily semblable, Of worldly trust, fals &amp; ful mutable, Who cast no pereil til þat it be-falle, In-stede of sugre ofte tasteth galle: Blendid with lust, whiche þat is present, Of þe future slouth and necligent Þat hem ne liste a-forn no meschef caste, Til in þe snare þei ben englued faste; For to provide þei ben graceles, Ful vnprudent and wilful rek[e]les. To caste pereil or þat it be-tyde: Þei swe her luste, her reson goth a-syde, As it be-fil whilom of þis two, Of Medea and [of] Iason also. But how-so-euere of Iason þat it be, I fynde pleynly þe harme allone had sche, Þe grete damage and þe final smerte, For lak of wisdam þat sche nolde aduerte What schul[de] falle, whan sche her Iourne toke, And hir fadir folily forsoke; But sith sche wrou?t only of wilfulnes, With-oute conseil or avysenes, Me list no more hir harmes to be-wayle, For lite or nou?t it my?t[e] now avayle. Late hir allone complayne hir damage: For wel I wote touching hir passage, It was not take in good plite of þe mone, Of hastines sche began to sone, Chesyng an hour þat was nat fortunat; For sche allone of frendys desolat Colchos forsoke, and is to schyp[pe] goon; And in al haste be byddyng of Iason, Hercules and al his companye, Þat with him com oute of Thesalye, With-oute tariynge, at onys at a worde, I-entred ben with-Inne [þe] schippes borde, Only for cause þat þe wynd was good And euery þing at her lust tho stood. And so be assent, þei stele a-wey be ny?t With al þe tresour þat þei cache my?t, And with hem had plente of vitaille; And forthe anoon þei be-gonne to seile By many coste &amp; many sondry Ile, Toward[es] Grece; and al þis mene while Was Medea glad and of good chere, Sche and Iason sittyng bothe I-fere. And Hercules, of verray gentilnes, Hir to comfort dide his besynes, Al feyni[n]gly, for þe maner sake, As þis louerys ful queynt can it make, Til þei han had hooly her plesaunce; Her lust fulfilled, þan entreþ variaunce, As it was preved by Iason outerly, Þat hathe for-sake ful vnkyndely Þis Medea, in peyne, sorwe, and wo. Of hir Guydo writ no wordis mo, Ne maketh of hir non other mencioun, By-cause, I trow in myn opinioun, Þat hir sorwes, ende and euerydel, Rehersed ben ful openly and wel Methamorphoseos, &amp; wryte þer ful pleyn: Wher as Naso recordeth in certeyn Hir deth nat only, nor hir heuynes, But parcel eke of þe vnkyndenes Of þis Iason, and telleth pleynli how Medea hir bothe sonys slowe, For þei wer like her fader of visage; And telleth eke, þat put hir moste in rage, How falsely he, I can hym not excuse, Loued another þat called was Ceruse; Eke in his pistles, who so taketh hede, Hir dedly sorwe he may beholde &amp; rede, And how þat sche hir trouþ abou?t[e] sore. Of Medea ?e gete of me no more In al þis boke, nor of hir auenture. But I wil now do my besy cure Hooly to turne my stile to Iason, And of þe werre he made on Lamedoun, Liche as in Guydo is openly discrived, After þat he in Grece was arived. Howe Kenge Pellee ressavide Iason with faire visage, bot inwardly he was full woo of his gode spede in Calchos. And howe Iason requires his vnkele for a navye to destroy þe Cyte of Troy. First whan Iason &amp; Hercules also I-londed werne, with many anoþer mo, In þe regne and lond of Thesalye, Kyng Pelleus, with al his cheualr[i]e, Caste hym pleynly þat he wil nat faille To mete his nevew at his arivaille. And whan þei mette, in contenaunce &amp; chere, Made it outward as hool &amp; as entere As he had hadde souereyn[ly] gladnes Of his kny?thood &amp; his hy?e prowes, Of his renoun and his manlyhede, Of his exspleyt and his good[e] spede, And þat Fortune to encrese his name Haþ causid hym, with so noble a fame, Out of Colchos with honour to repaire— Al-be his chere was outerly contrarye To his entent, þat euer he cam ageyn. But for al þat, with face hool and pleyn, He welcomed hym, al ageynes herte, Ful sore astonyed þat he euer a-sterte Þe auentures of Colchos perillous, And is retourned so victorious. But couertly his tresoun for to hyde, Al delay he gan to sette a-syde, And to Iason with chere ful benigne, His heritage first he gan resigne, Septre &amp; crovne &amp; kengdam at þe leste, For to parforme þe somme of his beheste, Liche as he was assured by his bonde. And Iason toke al in-to his honde, And gan his vncle in ful lowe maner First to þanke, with al his herte entere, And after þat ful kny?tly gan hym preye Goodly to here what þat he wil seie Of a mater þat fret his herte sore, From day to day encresyng euer more— Besechyng hym to graunte hym audience Touching a wrong and a violence Don vn-to hym, whan he non harm [ne] mente, In Troy[e] lond to Colchos as he went: “Þis [is] to seyn, þe kyng of Troy[e] tovn, With-in þe boundis of his regioun, Whan I and myne in gret aduersite, With wynd and wedir fordriven in þe see, Vs to refresche to londe dide arive, Not in purpos with hym for to strive, But for to reste vs after al oure wo A litel while, and forthe anoon to go; For we in soþe no maner harm ne þou?t: But he vnkyngly of verray malys sou?t Ageyn[e]s vs firste occasioun, Byddyng in haste to voyde his regioun, Not-withstondynge þat we com in pes, Liche as my broþer knoweth, Hercules, Vn-to no wy?t doyng no distresse. Wherfore, we praye to ?oure hy?e noblesse, To oure purpos for to condescende, Of whiche platly þis þe fynal ende: Þat we be sette, in ful conclusioun, Holy to werke to his distruccioun, Liche owre avov, whan we þen[ne]s went— ?if so be ?e goodly list assent— And al attonys, strongly and not spare, Maugrey his my?t to Troye for to fare, So þat we may fynde in ?ow fauour Vs to refresche with golde and with tresour, And only eke, of ?our curtesye, Vs strenthe also with ?our cheualrie.” And Pelleus, with-oute more abode, Anoon as he þis mater vnderstode, Assented is of herte and wil al-so, In þis viage with hem for to goo. And alle þe worþi of þat regioun, Kynges, dukes, and lordes of renoun, Ben acorded, þer is not on seyth nay, To gon with hem and helpen what þei may. And of þis Iourne chefe solicytour Was Hercules, þe worthi conquerour, And he in haste, his retenu to make, Toward Sparthos hath þe weye take, Whiche is an Ile to Grekys partinent, Fully obeying to her commaundement. In which Pollux and Castor eke also, Þe worþi kynges, þe my?ti breþer two, Wern, as I fynde, þat tyme gouernours, And bare her crowne liche noble werryours; And breþern wern also to El[e]yne, And as poetis liketh for to feyne, Þat Iubiter, for al his deite, Vp-on Dane bygat hem alle thre, Þat in bewte alle other dide excelle. And for Eleyne, liche as bokys telle, Conseyved was in Tyndaris þe yle, Vn-to þe lond Ioinyng of Cecyle, Þerfor of somme I fynde þat sche is After þe yle callid Tyndarys. Of hir birth me list no more endite, But furthe I þinke of Hercules to write, Þat haþ besou?t þis worþi kynges tveyne, With my?ty hond to don her besy peyne, Only to graunte with him for to wende To-Troye-ward, schortly þis þe ende. And to assenten þei sei not onys nay, With al þe power þat þei cache may, Ageyn what tyme þat hym list assigne. And Hercules, with chere ful benygne, Þanked hem of þat þei hym behy?t; And forthe he went in al þe hast he my?t To-ward Messene, þe strong[e] my?ti londe, With-Inne whiche þe noble kyng he fonde, Þe kny?tly man, þe worþi Thelamoun, Lorde and prince of þat regioun, Þat in armys was on þe manlyest Þat was alive, and egal with þe best. And whan he knewe þat Hercules was come, For Ioie he hath hym in his armys nome, An[d] reseived in alle maner þing, Liche as it sat to a worþi kyng. And whan he wist sothly what he ment, With-oute more anoon he dide assent With hym to goon, Troyans for to greue; And Hercules goodly toke his leue, And hym enhasteth to Thesalye ageyn, To Pelleus, and telleth hym certeyn, How he hath sped, besechyng hym also, In al þe haste þat it may be do, To send[e] lettris and hys lordes calle, And tassemble his worþi kny?tes alle, Thoru?-oute his londe, boþe ne?e and ferre, Suche as he knewe þat wer experte in werre, And hem also þat werne of counseyl sage— “For wit of hem þat be ronne in age, Is more þan force with-oute experience, But whan monhod is meynt with sapience, Who considereth, it may double avayle; And þay þat longe han vsed [to] trauayle, Lyche as it is pleynly to suppose, May help[e] moste oure Iourne to dispose; For vn-to age experience and witte, To ?outhe force and hardines[se] sitte. And whan þat bothe ben of on entent, Fully acorded to werke by assent, With [a] quarel grounded vppon ry?te, Thoru? help of grace þat hath treble my?te, Hem dare nat drede, with spere nor with schelde In kny?tly wyse for to holde a felde; For of kny?thood þe fame nor þe glorie, Nor in armys conquest nor victorie, Ben not assured vp-on multitude, But on manhod, so grace list conclude. Þer-fore lat vs, for tavenge oure wrong, First with ri?t make oure self[e] strong; And oure force manly for to schewe, Of kny?tis chose piken out a fewe, And devoide encombraunce of nombre; And so we schal oure foos best encombre.” And of al þat, þat Hercules hath seide, Kyng Pelleus was ri?t wel apaide, For hym þou?t his conseil was ri?t good. And Hercules, with-oute more abode, Is in gret haste with his meyne goon To a province þat callid is Philon, In whiche þer was a duke of noble fame, And as I fynde, Nestor was his name, Ful renomed and strong of chiualrie; And he was eke ful ny?e of allye To Hercules, and of þe same blood. And whan þat he pleynly vnderstood The purpos hool &amp; cause of his commyng, He grauntid hym, with-oute more tariyng, To goon hym silfe with him in this viage, With alle þe worþi of his baronage, And to be redy a-?eyn a certen day. And Hercules, as fast as [euere] he may, Repayred [is] home to Thesalye, Wher gadred was holy þe nauye Of þe lordis, ful redy appara[i]led, Wel enarmed and richelly vitailled. And Pelleus hath takyn fyrste þe see, And euery lorde, liche to his degree, I-schiped is and redi for to goon With Hercules and also with Iason, Her behestes manly to fulfille, Towardis Troye, þe cite for to spille. And after þat, sothly as I fynde, Þei nat abyde but vp-on þe wynde. Howe Kynge Pelleus with þe myghtti puyssaunce of Grece landyde at Symeonte afor þe Cite of Troye. Whan þat þe soote stormis of Aprille, Vn-to þe rote ful lawe gan distille His lusty licour, with many holsom schour, To reise þe vertu vp in-to þe flour; And Phebus was ascendyng in his spere, And on þe brest smote his bemys clere Of þe Ram, ful colerik at al, Halvynge in ver þe equinnoccial; Whan May kalendis entre in for-sothe, And Zephirus, ful agreable and smoþe, Þe tendre braunchis enspireþ &amp; doþe springe, And euery busche is lusty blossumynge, And from þe hil þe water is revolvid Of snowys white, þat Phebus hath dissoluyd, And þe bawme vapoureth vp a-lofte In-to þe eyre of þe erbes softe, Þe Rotis vertu, with colde of wynter hid, Hath hool his my?t and his force kyd, Oute of þe erþe in erbe and euery tree Schad in þe braunchis his humydite, Areised only with þe sonnys hete, And with þe moysture of þe reynes swete; Whan siluer welles scheden oute her stremys In þe ryuers, gilt with þe sonne bemys, And Flora had with newe grene ageyne Hir lyuere schad vp-on euery playn, And ny?tyngales, þat al þe wode rong, Ful amorously welcomed in hir song Þe lusty sesoun, fresche and desyrous, Namly to hertis þat ben amerous, And þe see is calme and blaundisching From trouble of wynde or wawy boilyng, And from tempest is smoþe to eskape— The same sesoun Grekys furth hem schape Towardis Troye: erlys, dukys, kyngis, Her schippis stoffid with al maner þingis, Þat to werre my?t hem moste avayle. And ri?t anoon þei be-gan to saile, Whan al was redy, with-oute more abode, Eche schip by oþer on þe water rood; And whan þe wynde at her lust gan blowe, A Ioie it was to sen hem go by rowe, Whiche made hem faste to hasten in her woye, Þat in schorte tyme þei com[e] be to Troye, And in þe hauene callid Symeonte. Whan Phebus fer vnder her orizonte I-westrid was, þat men ne my?t hym see, Grekys, eschapid alle pereils of þe see, Caste her ankres and þou?t[e] for þe beste, In her schippes þe same ny?te to reste. The noble kynge Pelle in his Tente declarede þe fyne of his landynge, for þe sege to be layde. And in þe morwe, whan þe larke song, Þe worþi Grekys, so manly &amp; so strong, Be-gan to lond, in al þe haste þei my?te, On Troye grounde, and her tentis py?te A-fore þe t?une, with gret diligence; For þei ne founde no maner resistence. And al þis while þei sette good awaite On euery syde, list þer wer disceite, Til on þe hour þat þe sonne bri?te Had in þe morwe schad his rody li?te Amyd þe felde, vppon euery tent, At whiche tyme, alle of oon assent, Þe Grekis wern assemblid euerychon, And by þe byddyng of þe kyng anon, Iason firste, and with hym Hercules, With many worþi being in þat pres, Ben to þe tent of Pelleus come. And whan þe lordis, boþe alle &amp; some, Wern to-gedre in þat place mette, And eche of hem in his degre was sette, Þan Pelleus, whan al [was] huscht &amp; stille, Be-gan ri?t þus to declare his wille: “O noble &amp; worþi, of hi?e estate &amp; lowe, Whos kny?tly fame þoru? þe worlde Is knowe, Reported is as fer as schineth sonne, Þat Grekis ?it neuer þing be-gonne Þat þei ne had victori at þe ende: For with þe laurer, as fer as man may wende, Þei haue be crowned of what þei toke on honde— Suche is her hap, boþe on se and londe— Wherfore, ?e lordis, moste worþi of renoun, ?e can remembre of kyng Lamedoun, And of þe wrong þat he vp-on ?ow wrou?te, Whan harme to hym noon of ?ow ne thou?te, Whiche mot be quytte, schortly þis þe ende, For we be come to stroye hym and to schende; Wherfor anon, in al þe haste we may, Late vs sette on with-oute more delay. But firste I rede þat we taken hede, To þinges þre, most helping in þis nede: First, be avis and gode discrescioun, For oure diffence and sauacioun, So prudently oure wardis for to make, Þat non of ours be at meschefe take, Þis ilke day, for lak of prouidence; Þe secunde is, to do oure diligence With al oure my?t and hool entencioun, For to labour to ful distruccioun Of oure foon, for oure owne glorie; And þe þridde, þat we may victorie Reioische of hem, platly at þe laste. And after þis, ?e may afore wel caste, ?iffe we of kny?thood, þoru? our hardines, May venquische hem, we schal so hi?e riches Conquere of hem to oure pocessioun— For it is knowe how þat Troye town, Of al plente, as it schal be founde, Of gold and tresour is passyngly habounde— Þat oure schippis, sothly as I wene, For to reseiue schal nat mow sustene Þe habundaunce þat is ?onde with-Inne, ?if it so be þat we þe cite wynne, As God vs graunte, ?if it be his wille.” And also faste as þe kyng was stille, Þe noble kny?te, þe strong[e] Hercules, In þe presence of þat worþi pres, Seide his counseil was he?ly to commende, For wis begynnyng is preysed be þe ende— “But to effecte our purpos for to bryng, My counseil is, in þe morwenyng, To-forne or we discured ben be day, Þat we vs arme in al haste we may, And on þis felde þat we do oure peyne For to deuyde oure meyne in-to tweyne; And of þe ton, schal kyng Thelamoun Be gouernour, for his hi?e renoun, And of þe toþer, kyng Pelleus schal haue Þe gouernaunce, wysly hem to saue; And I my silfe, &amp; Iason here my brother, Schal secrely go with alle þe toþer Vnder þe cite, or þe sonne schynes, And in þe bruschail and þe þikke vynes We schal vs hyde, &amp; kepe vs þer ful koye; For Lamedoun, þat is kyng of Troye, Anon as he may heren and espie Of þe Grekis, with his cheualrye Out of þe cite wele issen oute anoon With ?ow to fi?te, &amp; venge him on his foon; But whan he cometh to-our-schippis-ward, Nestor þe duke schal in þe firste ward Metyn with hym, and Castor schal also, Whan he seth tyme, kny?tly haue ado To help[e] Nestor, ?if þat it be nede. Þe þridde warde Pelleus schal lede; And whiles ?e þus hym occupie, Iason and I schal vs faste hye To þe cite, vnwiste of hem echon, I dout[e] nat we schal it wynne anoon. Doth be counseil, and it wil ?ow availe; And her my trouþe, ?e ne may not fayle For to conquere þe cite ?onde a-fore; Þis al and some—?e gete of me no more.” And þei acorde with al her strenthe &amp; my?te And armen hem in stele þat schon ful bri?te Ageyn þe sonne amorwe whan he riseth, And wrou?t fully as Hercules deuiseth. Howe Lamedon þe kenge of Troye, sodeynly wernede, with his Chivalry gave the Grekys batayle, &amp; þere was sclayn. And Lamedoun, whan he herd[e] telle Of her comyng, hym lyst no lenger dwelle, But out he went with many a [noble] kny?te, Flourryng in ?outhe &amp; desirous to fy?te, And alle þo þat my?t armes bere, Or koude schete or durste handle a spere. And whan þei were assemblid in þe felde, Eueryche his armes depeynt vppon his scheld, Brouded or bete vpon his cote armvre, Þan Lamedoun with al his besy cure Set hem in ordre, &amp; his wardes maketh, And in þe felde furthe his weye he taketh Towardis þe Grekis, as eny lyne ri?te, Fully purposyng to abide and fi?te. He was nat war of hem þat were behynde, He nat aduerteth nor casteþ in his mynde Þe grete slei?te nor þe trechery, Þat hym was schape, he koude it nat espie; But furþe he went with his wardis set. And þe Grekis anoon with hym han met, With herte bolde, astonyed nat at al— Duke Nestor firste, sturdy as a wal, In whos manhod was neuer founde lake, Ful kny?tly þan vppon hors[e] bake, To hert his men &amp; his kny?tes eke, Gan presen in with many worþi Greke, With Lamedoun sturdely to mete. At whiche tyme þei felt[e] ful vnswete, And in þe frountel, ful many manly man With scharpe speris first to-gidre ran; And with swerdis, scharpe &amp; kene grounde, Was þilke day ?ouen many [a] wounde, Wher as þei mette, vp-on euery syde, Þoru? plate &amp; mayle her woundis bledde wyde. And basenettis þei riuen to þe crowne; Þe noise of strokis in þe eyr gan sowne; And of þe blood þat was schad of newe, Þe grene soile chaunged hath his hewe: For it was died playnly in-to red, Vp-on þe whiche ful many man lay ded, And many worþi loste þer his lif. And certeynly, in þis mortal strif, Þe Grekis had discomfeted ben echon, Nad[de] Castor socored hem anoon; Þei of Troye so manly han hem bore, Þat many kny?t of Grekis were I-lore: But whan Castor entreþ in batail With his kny?tes, so sore he dide assayl Þe worþi Troyans, þat with spere and scheld Grekis ageyn recured han þe felde, Þat many oon lyþ slay[e]n on þe grene, Girt þoru? þe body with scharp speris kene, Þat þai of Troye, in þis mortal stour, Were driue a-bak, til þer cam socour To hem in hast of worþi Lamedoun, Whiche entred [in] liche a wood lyoun, And made weye vp-on euery syde. And where as he made his swerde to glide, Þer was but deth, so manly he hym bare, Þat wel vnneþe was þer [n]on þat dar Abide his stroke; for, ridyng vp and dovn, He made weye aboute hym enviroun. In þe rengis he hath his foon oute sou?t; Þat day in armys merveiles he haþ wrou?t, Þat by his manhod and his worþines He Grekis hath brou?t in swiche distres, Þat þei his swerde fledden as þe deth, Merciles so many of hem he sleth. Of whiche slau?ter þe Grekis wer confus, Til Pelleus cam to her rescus, Iros and wood, as he wer falle in rage, He thou?t he wolde þe grete pompe aswage Of hem of Troye, and so he dide anoon; For he vnhorseth of hem many oon, And felly slowe al þat stood hym aforne, And many harnes he hath þat day to-torne, And made scheldes for to rive a-soundre, Þat to be-holde it was a verray wonder, Til Lamedoun his peple sawe goo bake, For Pelleus brou?t hem so to wrake. Wher-of in hert he felte ful gret peyne, Besechyng hem to repeyre ageyne, And kyþe her my?t &amp; lyche as men endure; And so þe felde he made hem to recure, Til duke Nestor knewe þat Lamedoun, Amyd þe felde, was kyng of Troye town. And ri?t anoon, with-oute more abood, A-geyn[e]s hym a ful gret pas he rood; And whan þe kyng dide hym first espie, Of hi?e dispit, of rancour and envie, In kny?tly wyse gan to torne ageyn, No þing agast, but of hi?e disdeyn, With Irous hert embollid al with pride, His hors fersly gan takyn in þe syde, Til þer ran out þe verray red[e] blood; And to Nestor, liche as he were wood, He rood anoon, and his spere brake; But he ful kny?tly kepte his hors[e] bak, And ful deliuerly, hym ageyn to quyte, With a spere, ful scharp[e] [whet] to byte, Þoru? schelde &amp; breste ?af hym swiche a wounde, Þat from his hors he felde him dovn to grovnde Of whiche fal, þe kyng no þing a-ferde, But ros hym vp &amp; pulled out a swerde, So anger fret hym at his hert[e] rote, Þat he vnhorsed fe?te muste on fote; Wher-of he was in parti ful confus, Til oon Cedar cam to his reskus, Þat was made kny?te þe silfe same ?ere, ?ong, fresche, and lusty, and of noble chere, Sitting þat tyme on a noble stede. And whan þat he gan to taken hede, And sawe þe kyng on fote at meschef fi?te, Gan to prike, in al þe hast he my?te, Toward Nestor, &amp; with a spere hym hitte, From his sadel þat he made hym flitte Down to þe grovnde a-fore kyng Lamedoun. But he anon, liche a champioun, Recured vp, and hym silfe diffendeth; And many strok eche on other spendeth, With scharp[e] swerdis, kene for to bite, Eueryche at other gan to foyne &amp; smyte, Til Lamedoun, with a despitous chere, From his face raced his visere, And by force, al at onys smet A riche cercle from his basenet, Of large perle goyng enviroun— With creste and al, he fersly bette adovn: Þat whiles Nestor þus aforn him stood, His face was al depeynt with blood, Þat certeynly, þe sothe to conclude, Had nat Grekis with gret multitude Reskewed hym, he hadde of Lamedoun Be slaye as faste; for he was bore doun Vn-to þe erþe a-mong þe hors[e] feet. But Castor þo?te þat he nolde leet To be his helpe, as he behelde a-feer; And Irously he toke a my?ty speer, And to Cedar, þat I spak of late, He gan to ride and priken in gret hate: But or he cam to hym, dout[e]les, A Troyan kny?t, callid Segnerides, Cosyn to Cedar, whan he haþ þis seen, On a courser rood anoon be-tween; And with a spere he smete Castor so, Þat with þe stroke he brake evene atwo. To whom Castor, with-oute more areste, Hath with a spere, amyddes of þe breste, Segnerides ?oue a mortal wounde, Þat likly was neuer for to sounde. Wher-of Cedar cau?te swiche envie, Þat he anoon, of malencolye And of dispit boilyng in his herte, Segnerides whan he sawe so smerte, Maugre who gruccheþ, amyddes of þe feld, Of verray my?t from Castor toke his scheld, And þoru? viser, of rancour &amp; of rage, He wounded hym amyddes the visage, And his hors from hym also he cau?te, And to his squier manfully it rau?te: Þat certeynly he stood in swiche disioynt, Þis worþi Castor, þat he was in poynt To haue ben take of hem of Troye tho; For he on fote with hem moste [haue] go, Nadde Pollux, with many manly kny?t, Mo þan seuene hundrid in stele armyd bri?t, Þe raþer com Castor to reskewe; Whiche after hem so sore gan to sewe, Þat maugre hem, Castor whan he fond, Of force he toke hym fre out of her hond, And to his hors restorid hym ageyn. And after [þat], þis Pollux in certeyn, Of verray angre and of fervent Ire, Agein Troyens with rancour set a-fire, Þat al attonis he vppon hem set; And in his mood, by fortune as he met A Troyan kny?t, called Eliatus, In armys ?ong, fresche, and desirous, Wonder semly and but tender of age, Þe kynges sone, also, of Cartage, And nevewe eke vn-to Lamedoun, Whom Pollux hath, lyche a ferse lyoun, With-oute routhe, pite, or mercy, In þe rengis slawen cruelly— Þat Lamedoun, whan he gan take hede, Of inward dool felte his herte blede, Whan he hym sawe, euene vppon þe deth, Ful pitously ?elden vp þe brethe, Vp-on þe playn, as he lay hym be-forn. For whiche anoon he made sowne an horn, At whiche þer cam, in ful riche array, Seuene thowsand kny?tes, in al [þe] hast þei may, Vp-on his deth avenged for to be. Whiche mercyles, of gret[e] cruelte, Þe Grekis han here &amp; þer I-grounded: Here lith on ded, þer a-noþer wounded, So þat þei my?t with hem haue no tak. So mortally þei made hem gon abak, Þat al gan turne to her confusioun; And finaly þat day with Lamedoun Þe tryvmphe had &amp; þe felde y-goon, Saue þat, allas, oute of þe toun anoon Vn-to þe kyng þer cam a messager, Þat hath hym tolde with a ful pitous chere, How þe Grekis han þe cite take. Þan for to se þe wo he dide make, It wolde haue made a pitus hert as blyue Of verray dool asondre for to rive, So sore he gan with-in hym silfe to morne. He wiste nat what party he my?t turne; But in a were he abydynge longe, Aforn hym sawe þe my?ty Grekis stronge, And in þe cyte anoþer host behynde: Almost for wo he went out of his mynde; And sodenly, bacward as he behilde Toward þe cite, he sawe com in þe felde First Hercules and with hym Iason, Þat by her sley?t wonen han þe toun. And in al hast, þis cruel Hercules, Þe my?ty geaunt of force per[e]les, Liche a lyoun, wood and dispitous, Or a tigre in rage furious, Gan of newe hem of Troye assaile, And with [his] swerde perce plate and mail, Whiche of labour wer ful mate and feynt, And of long fi?te with werynes atteynt. And he cam in, lusty, fresche, and grene, Þat þei his force my?t[e] nat sustene; For as he rod among hem here &amp; ?onder, In cruel wyse he s[e]uered hem asonder, And put hem holy in þis hi?e meschaunce, Oute of rewle and of gouernaunce; So þat þe kyng, oppressed al with dool, Of his wardis destitute and sool, At meschef lefte, and al infortunat, And of comfort fully disconsolat— Þis Hercules, with a dispitous look, With scharp[e] spors his stede felly toke, And cruelly rod to Lamedoun, And to þe erthe fersly bare hym doun, And vp-on hym, in al þe haste he my?te, Downe of his hors sodeinly aly?te, And my?tely rent of his basenet, And with a swerde, scharp[e] grounde &amp; whet, Smot of his hede, þer was noon oþer grace, And caste it furthe in þe silue place Among þe hors, by cruel violence, With-oute pite or any reuerence. And in a rage ra?te his hors a?eyn, And lyche a lyoun rengyng on þe playn Bar downe &amp; slowe what cam in his weye; And many Troyan þat day made he deye, Þat liche to schepe wer forskatered wyde, Al destitute of gouernour or guyde, Ne can no rede, schortly to conclude; For þe Grekis with double multitude Gan hem enchace to þe deth ful blyve, Þat wel vnneþe þer left noon alyue. Þe feld þei han, and ben þat day victours; And with tryvmphe, liche as conquerours, To þe cite þei take her weye after, And rende dovn boþe sparre &amp; rafter; And al þe tresour &amp; riches of þe tovn, Þei toke anoon to her pocessioun, Who euer grucche or be lef or lothe, What þei founde, pleynly with hem gothe. In þe temples þei dide gret offence, To þe goddis doyng no reuerence; For al þei spoyle, with-oute drede or fere, And vn-to schip euery þing þei bere; And merciles on croked, olde, and lame, Her swerde þei made cruelly atame; And children soukyng at her moder brest, Þei mordre &amp; sle with-oute more arest; And ?ong[e] maydenes, wepyng in distresse, Ful gentil born, and of gret fayrnesse, With hem þei ladde, &amp; may hem nat excuse, Hir fresche bewte falsly to mysvse. Þei waste &amp; brenne and consumen al; And with-oute þei brake a-dovn þe wal. And Exione, þe kynges dou?ter dere, Þat was to hym passyngly entere By his lyve—I mene Lamedoun— Meke and benyng of condicioun, Hercules hath anoon hir take, Þat for drede pitously gan quake, And hir deliuered vn-to Thelamoun, For he entrede first in-to þe toun. And he his ?ifte reseyued hath at gre, Be-cause sche was surmountyng of bewte, And tretid hir after as he wolde, Nat lyche as he a kynges dou?ter schulde. For syth he gat hir þat day be victorie, For his worschip and his owne glorie, Havyng rewarde to hir hi?e degre, He schulde rather of kyngly honeste, And of kny?thood, haue weddid hir þerfore, Syth þat sche was of blood so gentil bore, Þan of fals lust, ageyn al godlyhede, Vsed hir bewte and hir womanhede Dishonestly, and in synful wyse— Of royal blood nat liche þe hi?e emprise, Nor þe doctrine of naturis ri?t, Nor liche þe norture of [a] gentil kny?t: Considered first hir [birþe] and hir kynrede, Hir grene ?ouþe, and hir maydenhed, So gode, so fayre, so womanly þer-to. A kynges dou?ter of birth sche was also; To haue wedded hir, it had[de] be no schame. Now, Thelamoun, in soth þou wer to blame; For þoru? þe errour of þi gouernaunce, Þer kyndled was, of ful hy?e vengaunce, So hoot a sparke after of envye, Þat þoru? þe worlde þe fyr gan multiplie, Whiche was nat li?t to quenchyn of his hete. For hatred olde to brenne can nat lete With new[e] flawme, who so taketh hede; ?if it nat smeke, it is þe more [to] drede, As in þis story her after schal be knowe. And whan þis toun was brent &amp; brou?t[e] lowe, Boþe tour &amp; wal with þe soil made pleyn, And no þing stood, allas, þat may be seyn, So outterly þe Grekis hem oppresse, Makyng al waste liche a wyldernesse— For good &amp; tresour &amp; riches infinyt, With many Iowel, ful pleysyng of delyt, To her schippis out of þe toun þei lede, And in schort tyme homward þei hem spede, With tresour stuffid, &amp; haboundance of good. And whan þei seye þat þe wedir stood, Þe wynde also, at her lust þei hadde, Þei gan to saille, &amp; with hem hom þei ladde Exyona and many a mayde mo, Þat out of Troye in-to Grece goo. And seyling forþe, with-in a lytel space, Þei ben eskapid [fro] þe se by grace, And vn-to lond aryued merily. At whos commyng þe Grekis outerly So Ioyful ben of her good[e] spede; And specialy, in Guydo as I rede, Her schippes wern with golde &amp; tresour lade; Wher-of in herte þei wexe wonder glade. And for þei hadde out so wel hem born, To conquere Troye, and so fewe lorne Of her meine, þei þanke her goddes alle, And of þe grace þat to hem is falle. For with þe tresour þat þei han hom brou?t, Ful many pore was made vp of nou?t; Þoru?-out þe lond þere was swiche aboundance, So moche good and so gret sufficaunce, Þat no wi?t had among[es] hem no nede. And many day þis blisful lyfe þei lede, From ?er to ?er by reuolucioun; And for her manhood &amp; her hi?e renoun, Her honour ran rounde þe worlde aboute, Þat hem toffende euery londe hath doute, For her kny?thod, &amp; for þei wer so wyse. And til þe story liste ageyn deuyse, In þis mater ferþer to procede, With þe fauour of ?oure goodlyhed, I wil me reste for a litel space; And þan vp-born with support of ?our grace, Forþe a-complische, as I vndertook. And here an ende of þe first[e] book I make now, with quakyng hond for drede, Only for fer of ?ow þat schal it rede, Liste ?e, allas, of hasty mocyoun, Ne wil not haue no compassioun, Pyte nor rouþe vp-on my rud[e]nesse; Lowly beseching to ?our gentilnes, Of mercy only, boþe ne?e and ferre, Where ?e fynde þat I fayle or erre, For to correcte, or ?e ferþer flitte, For to ?our grace I holy al commytte. [Explicit liber Primus INcipit liber Secundus.] BOOK II. The envious ordre of Fortunas meving, In worldly þing, fals and flekeryng, Ne will not suffre vs in þis present lyf To lyue in reste with-oute werre or striffe; For sche is blinde, fikel, and vnstable, And of her cours, fals &amp; ful mutable. Who sit hi?est, sche can doun hym enclyne Whan he leest weneþ bring hym to ruyne, With awaites þat gladly ben sodeyne, And with hir face þat partid is on tweyne Schewen most hool, whan sche is leste to triste; Þat wel wer hym þat hir deceytes wiste, And hir engynes &amp; hir trappis knewe, Þat euery day in hir courte be newe. Of whiche, in soth, I wel afferme dar, No mortal man may in þis lyf be war: For sche vn-evene peisyng in balaunce, With conterfet and feyned contenaunce, With lokyng pleyn &amp; chere of flaterye, Vnwarly can blere a mannys eye, And hym be-gyle—þis þe verray soth— With a face blaundissching and smoþe, Whan sche hath hym from hi?e degre brou?t lowe, Ful falsly smyle &amp; make hym þe mowe. And ?it som while, most varriant of hewe, Sche vn-to somme pretendeth to be trewe; For sche whilom to somme is fauourable, And to somme fals and deceyvable. Sche can reise on, &amp; bryng another doun, Þis fals[e] lady of transmutacioun; To somme sche ?eueth renoun and victorie, And doth hem floure in honour &amp; glorie; And somme sche can apeiren with fals fame, And gilt[e]les put a man in blame. To somme sche is goodly and benyngne; And of disdeyn sche can also maligne Ageyn anoþer, &amp; make hym loute lowe; And from her sees sche can kynges þrowe, And hem avale, for al her hi?e toures. And sche can plonge worþi emperoures From þe hille of hi?e prosperite In-to þe vale of aduersite; Þe riche emporische, of rancour &amp; disdeyn, And þe pore sche can enhaunce ageyn, Þis fals[e] goddes with hir eyen blynde, Set on aforn, a-noþer goth be-hynde; And doth on renne, and another halte; And on sche can in rychesse hi?e exalte, And anoþer plonge in pouerte, In whom no man may haue no sikerte. To somme sugre and hony sche distilleth; And of somme sche þe botel filleth With bitter galle, myrre, and aloes. And þus þis lady, wilful recheles, As sche þat is froward and peruers, Hath in hir celer drinkes ful diuers; For sche to somme, of fraude and of fallas, Mynystreth pyment, bawme, &amp; ypocras: And sodeynly, whan þe sote is past, Sche of custom can ?euen hem a tast, For to conclude falsely in þe fyn, Of bitter eysel and of egre wyn, And corosyues þat fret and perce depe, And narkotykes þat cause men to slepe. Þus sche to hem, þat hir tonne aproche, After soote, þe bitter can abroche— In her regne, þis quene of variaunce, Whos Ioye fyneth alwey with meschaunce. Who trusteþ hir, sche wil hym ouercaste, And hym deseyue pleynly at þe laste, Of what estat euer þat he be, Þis double lady of mutabilite. Sethe here example of kyng Lamedoun, Whom sche haþ brou?t to confusioun For litel cause, and for a þing of nou?t; Hir cruelte he haþe to dere a-bou?t. Wherfore, I rede, euery man take hede To gynne a quarel where as is no nede: For litel fire vnder asches reke So may be kyndled þat it wil oute breke In-to swyche flawme, men may it nat apese; Who best can suffre most schal haue his ese. Þerfor, ?e kynges and lordis euerychon, Make ?ow a merour of þis Lamedoun, And beþ wel war to do no violence Vn-to straungers, whan þei do noon offence, Whan þei com fer in-to ?oure regioun: Ne suffre hem nat, by noon oppressioun, In ?oure boundis for to haue no wrong; For in ?oure owne, þou?e þat ?e be strong, And my?ty eke among ?oure legys alle, A-noþer day paraunter may be-falle, Þat whan þat ?e ful litel þenke on hit, Of sodeyn cas þat ?e may be quyte And I-thanked in a-noþer place, Of auenture ?if ?e happe passe. Þerfore, whan ?e may eny swyche espie, Doth hem good chere of ?our curtesye, And prudently consydereth in ?our wit, Þat to a lorde of gentilnes hit sit, To euery straunger goodly hym to haue: Þer is no þing may more his honour saue, Þan to refresche hem frely &amp; disport. Þan may þei after good of hym reporte; Be whos contrarie haþ moche wo be wrou?t A-fore þis tyme, ?if it be wel sou?t: Þe first[e] Troye vtterly distroyed, And þe peple in sorwe &amp; wo acloied, Lad in-to exil, fer from her cite, Lyvyng in þraldom and captiuite; And Exyone, as ?e haue herde me telle, Lad in-to Grece with Thelamoun to dwelle. For whom [þer was], as Guydo can ?ow teche, After take so gret vengaunce &amp; wreche On ouþer parte, þat in verray trouthe For to here it is to moche routhe, As in þis boke ?e may after rede, Ceryously ?if ?e liste take hede. For gladly ay þe reuolucioun Of fatal þing, by disposicioun, Is so envious, and alwey meynt with wo, Þat in þis world, wher-so þat we go, We trewly may aduerten in oure þou?t, Þat for þe valu of a þing of nou?t, Mortal causes and werris first by-gonne; Strif and debate, here vnder þe sonne, Wer meved first of smal occasioun, Þat caused after gret confusioun; Þat no man can þe harmys half endite. For, for a cause dere y-now?e a myte, Eche is redy to distroien other; A man for litel wil strive with his broþer; Blood is vnkynde, whiche gretly is to drede. Allas! whi nyl þei taken better hede? For olde Troye &amp; afterward þe newe, Þoru?e smal enchesoun, who þe trouþe knewe, Wer finally brou?t to distruccioun, As olde bokes maken mencioun; And many worþi and many noble kny?t Slayn in þe feld by dures of þat fi?t— Kynges, princes at þe sege ded, Whan Antropos to-brak hir lyves thred, Þat for to telle þe meschef and þe wo, I want[e] connynge, and I fele also My penne quake &amp; tremble in my hond, List þat my lord, dredde on see and lond, Whos worþines þoru? þe world doþ sprede, My makyng rude schal beholde &amp; rede, Whiche of colour ful nakyd is and bare: Þat but ?if he of his grace spare For to disdeyne, and list to haue pite, For fere I tremble þat he schuld it se. But only mercy, þat doþe his hert embrace, Byt me preswme fully in his grace; Seynge in hym, most vertuous and good, Mercy anexid vn-to royal blood, As to a prince longeþ ny?e and ferre, Ay to-fore ry?t, pite to preferre. For þoru?e þe support of his hi?e noblesse Sowpowailled, I wil my stile dresse To write forþe þe story by and by Of newe Troye in ordre Ceriously, As myn auctor in latyn, Guydo, writ. Preying þe reder, wher any word myssit, Causyng þe metre to be halte or lame, For to correcte, to saue me fro blame: Late hym nat wayte after coryouste, Syth þat in ryme ynglysch hath skarsete. I am so dulle, certeyn, þat I ne can Folwen Guydo, þat clerke, þat coryous man, Whiche in latyn hath be rethorik Set so his wordis, þat I can nat be lyke. To sewe his stile in my translacioun, Word by word, lyche þe construccioun, After þe maner of gramariens, Nor lyke þe stile of rethoricyens, I toke nat on me þis story to translate; For me to forther Clyo com to late, Þat in swyche craft hath gret experience; I leue þe wordis and folwe þe sentence. And trouþ of metre I sette also a-syde, For of þat arte I hadde as þo no guyde Me to reducyn, whan I went a-wrong; I toke non hede nouþer of schort nor long, But to þe trouþe, and lefte coryouste Boþe of makyng and of metre be, Nat purposyng to moche for to varie, Nor for to be dyuerse nor contrarie Vn-to Guydo, as by discordaunce; But me conforme fully in substaunce, Only in menyng, to conclude al on; Al-be þat I ne can þe wey[e] goon To swe þe floures of his eloquence; Nor of peyntyng I haue noon excellence With sondry hewes noble, fresche, and gay; So riche colours biggen I ne may; I mote procede with sable and with blake. And [in] enewyng wher ?e fynde a lak, I axe mercy or I fro ?ow twynne; And with ?our fauour I wil a-non begynne, And in al haste my style furthe directe; And where I erre, I praye ?ow to correcte. Of Priamus, þe sonne of Lamedoun which, at þe destruccyoun of Troye, was at the obsydey of A Castel. And howe mony sonnes and doughters that Priamus had. The same tyme whan þat Troye toun Destroyed was, and kyng Lamedoun Was also slayn, þoru? þe cruelte Of Hercules, vnder his cyte, He hadde a sone, þe story telleþ vs, Whiche was his eyr, I-called Priamus, Wonder manly, discret, and ful prudent, Whiche þat tyme from Troye was absent, Whan his fader loste þus his lyf; For he þat tyme with Eccuba his wyfe, And with his sonys, aboute a castel lay, And alle his kny?tes, to gete it ?if he may, Þat hath on hem my?tely werreyed: For þei his fader han falsely disobeyed, And vn-to hym be rebel wonder long; Al-be Priam, with sawtis huge and strong, Hem hadde assayled ofte &amp; many sythe; His strengþe on hem liche a kny?t to kythe, To gete in armys worschip and honour, And hem to daunte liche a conquerour, He caste hym fully or þat he departe. For day by day his lyf he gan iuparte, At her wallis for to preve his my?t, With many baroun and many worþi kny?t; For he ?it had his ?ong[e] lusty blood, And was of age flouryng in kny?thod, And at assautis &amp; swiche maner strife, On with þe first [for] to auntre his lyf. To hert his men, hym list nat be behynde For drede of deth, sothly as I fynde, A-fore þe castel hi?e and þikke wallyd. And be his wyfe þat Eccuba was callyd, Þis Priam had, ful worþi of degre, Fyve sonys and ?ong[e] dou?tres thre, Of whiche þe eldest Hector callid was. Whiche also fer as Phebus in compas A natural day goth his cercle aboute, So fer of hym, with-outen any doute, Reported was þe renoun and þe name, Þe worþines, and þe noble fame. For liche as bokis of hym specefye, He was þe Rote and stok of cheualrie, And of kny?thod verray souereyn flour, Þe sowrs and welle of worschip &amp; honour; And of manhod, I dar it wel expresse, Example and merour; &amp; of hi?e prowesse, Gynyng &amp; grounde; &amp; with al þis I-fere, Wonder benigne &amp; lawly of his chere, Discret also, prudent and vertuous. Of whom þe dedis &amp; actis merveillous Remembrid ben of so long a-goon; For he allone excelled euerychon, In olde auctours rede &amp; ?e may fynde, Of his kny?thood how ?it þei make mynde. Þe nexte broþer callid was Paris, To whom Nature ?af at hir deuyse Of schap &amp; forme, bewte, and semlynes, Þat to remembre his excellent fairnes, In his tyme, with-outen any drede, He passed alle þat I can of rede; And he was eke a ful manly kny?te; But most he vsed, whan he schulde fi?t, In his hond for to bere a bowe: For swiche an archer no man koude knowe, For to seken bothe fer and nere, Þat of schetyng my?t[e] ben his pere, As it was founde, whan he had ado; And Alisaundre he callyd was also. Þe þridde sone hi?t[e] Dephebus, A worþi kny?t and a chiualrous, And had in armys a ful gret renoun, And was a man of hi?e discrecioun, And wyse of counseil, myn auctour telleþ þus. Þe firthe brother, called Elenus, Sadde and discret, and of hi?e prudence, And was also a man of greet science, And renomed, þer-with in special, In alle þe artis called liberal, For he in hem was expert ari?t. Þe fyfte sone was a worþi kny?te, Fresche and lusty, and ?ongest of hem alle, And, as seith Guydo, Troylus men hym calle: A manly man founden in bataille, And desyrous his fomen for tassaille; Oon þe best in his tyme founde; And called was Hector þe secounde For his manhood, þoru?-oute Troye bok; Whiche in þe werre ful ofte vp-on hym tok Of his kny?thod many hi?e emprise, As þe story here after schal deuyse. And in his bok liche as writ Virgile, Þe poete olde, by ful souereyn stile, How þat þe kyng Priam had also By Eccuba other sonys two; And by record of þis Virgilius, Þe ton was called Pollyodorus, Whom Priamus, in his grene ?outhe, Whan þe comynge was of Grekis kouthe To-Troye-ward, in alle haste anoon, With gold, tresour, and many riche stoon, Sent hym forth besyde vn-to a kyng, Of ful gret trust, to haue hym in kepyng Til tyme he seye what conclusioun Þer schulde falle, after of þe toun, And eke what fyn þe werre wolde take, Þat vp-on hem þe Grekis dide make. But þilke kyng for fals[e] couetyse Of þis tresour, þat ?e han herde deuyse, Whan þat he sawe Fortunys variaunce Toward Priam, &amp; his vnhappy chaunce, Like a tiraunt and murderere also, Þe childes throte made kutte a-two. And after þat, he ful cruelly Made his men to burye hym priuely, Þat no man my?t his tresoun vnderstonde, Be-syde a see depe vnder þe stronde. Þe toþer sone, also as I rede In Virgile, was callyd Ganymede, Whom Iubiter in a forest hent Vp-on a day as he on huntyng went, And bare hym vp aboue þe sterres clere, And maked hym in heuene his botelere, Eternaly with Iuno for to wone, In stede of Hebes, hir owne dere sone. Þe first[e] dou?ter of kyng Priamus Hi?te Creusa, as seith Virgilius In his Eneydos, sothly as it was; And sche was weddid vn-to Eneas, As seith þis story; and eke þis ilke Enee Was wonderful in his natiuite: Of whom þe fader, I fynde dout[e]les, Was in his tyme callid Anchyses, Þat hym begat on Venus þe goddes; For after hir he hadde such fairnes, Þat neuere wyht ne kowde ?et yse A man þat was more passyng of bewte, Of whom þis story, touchyng his werching, Schal ?ow declare many wonder þing. For it is he to whom so greet a loos Virgile ?af in his Eneydos; For he þat boke in worschip of Enee Compiled hath, liche as ?e may se, Of his kny?thod &amp; many strong batail Be hym achevid or he wan Ytaille, After ful long þat þe royal toun Of Troye was brou?t to confusioun. And his conquest, ?if ?e list take hede, In þis poete ?e may be ordre rede, And þe armys wrou?t in al his age, And his commyng also to Cartage Fro Troye-ward, in a litel while— Al þis ?e may beholde[n] in Virgile. A-nother dou?ter also, it is founde, Kyng Priam had, of birthe þe secunde, Callid Cassandra, of ful gret sadnes, And was in maner a diuyneresse, And in eche art had experience, Of þingis future fully prescience To telle a-forn what [þat] schal betyde; Of whom þe fame sprang in costys wyde; Whiche kepte hir chaste in virginite, And ay in prayer and in honeste Sche ladde hir lyf, and in deuocioun, After þe ritys and religioun Of paganysme vsed in þo dawes, Þe obseruauncys kepyng of her lawes. Þe þridde dou?ter hy?t[e] Polycene, ?ongest of al; and euer a maide clene Sche kepte hir silf, and honest in hir lawe, In-to þe hour þat Pirrus haþ hir slawe: Of schap, of forme was neuer be Nature Wrou?t nor schape a fairer creature. Eke as I fynde, þis noble kyng also Hadde þritty sonys, þe boke seith, &amp; no moo, Hardy in armys and noble founde at al, Þat callyd wern his sonys natural. And þei wern alle, I excepte noon, Worþi kny?tes and manly men echon; And her names who so list to knowe, He schal fynde hem write vp-on a rowe After þis story, eueryche after other, Begynnygne first at the eldest brother. Howe tydengys kame to kynge Priamus howe his Cite was distroyede, and his Fadire sclayn. And whiles Priam at þe sege laye To-fore þe castel, to gete it ?if he may, And þer aboute haþ many way[e] sou?t, Þe woful tydyngys ben vn-to hym brou?t, How þe Grekis han take Troye toun, And slawe his fader, worþi Lamedoun; And how þe cite, of olde fundacioun, Ful pitously was turned vp so doun; Þe worþi lordys and gentil-men echon Take and slawe, and I-left nat on Of hem alyve, þoru?e Grekis cruelte, After þe ruyne, allas, of her cyte; And Exyoun, his owne suster dere, Lad in-to exile with hir eyne clere. Wher-of þe kyng in hert is stonyed so, For verray sorwe he nyste what to do, His sodeyn wo gan hym so constreyne. He sobbeth, wepeth, þat of mortal peyne He þou?t his hert wolde a-sondre breste, Of hi?e distres, for he my?t haue no reste. And in[-to] teris he gan hym silf distille, Þat for to dye was fynally his wille; And Fortune, þat can so falsly varie, With dreri hert he be-gan to warie, Þat sche to hym was so deseyuable, So inly cruel and vnmerciable, So dispitous, and so sterne of face, So vengable and deuoyde of grace: For of envye, with a rage thou?t, Sche haþ hir werst of malis on hym wrou?t, And felly schewed what sche my?t[e] do; Þat in þis world was neuer wi?t so wo, As I suppose, of no maner age, To rekne al his harmes and damage. For whiche anon, in al þat euer he may, First he chaungeþ all his riche array, Trist and hevy, with dedly face pale, So astoned with þis mortal tale, Þat his desyre was to haue ben ded; With countenaunce enclyned and his hed, Þis lyf he ladde, &amp; clad hym al in blak. And sodeynly he þe sege brak, And wolde as þo no lenger þer abyde; But with his folke anon he gan to ride, Þat pytously gan with hym to morne, And toward Troye attonys þei returne. And whan þat he haþ þe cite founde, Pleyn with þe soil &amp; evene with þe grounde, Þe hi?e wallys, whilom þik and longe, I-bete doun, þat wer made so strong, And his towres and paleys principal, Þat was in byldyng so excellent royal, So famows riche, and of gret noblesse, He fynt al turned in-to wildernesse: His peple slayn, his suster lad a-way— For verray wo he nyst[e] what to say, For þe constreynt of his aduersite, And for his harmys þat nyl recured be. For in þat tyme he was fully sure, Vp-on no syde þer was no recure; Wherfore he can not but sobbe &amp; wepe, And from his brest, with si?es sou?t ful depe, Breken oute, with a ded visage. And þus, allas, in þis furious rage, Ful pitously al his hoste and he With-oute respite contwne dayes thre. Til at þe last þe myrke skyes blake Gan of her wo in party for to slake, And þe tempest somdel gan with-drawe, And of her wepyng blaundische gan þe waw; As whan þe flood of wo is ouerpassed, Þe ebbe of Ioye folwen most in haste. To sorwen euer, it wolde her hertis schende; And at a terme euery wo mote ende: For þou? for frendis men ay wepe &amp; weyle, After her deth þer may no recure vaile. Wherfore þe kyng, after al [t]his care, Hath sou?t a weye þe cite to repare; And cast hym fully, ?if it wolde be, To make vertu of necessite; And manfully, after al his tene, Whan þat þe eyr gan to wexe clene Of þe mystis of his cloudy sorwe, And þat somdel adawe gan þe morwe, Of heuynes after þe dirke ny?t, Chased aweye with a sonne bry?t Of new[e] Ioye: for ay þe fyn of wo Mote be gladnes whan þat sorwe is go— And so Priam after a certeyn space, Whan his sorwe gan lite &amp; lite pace, And of wysdam in al his pitous smerte Gan prudently to plukkyn vp his herte, And of his eyne þe wawes gon[ne] clere, A-noon he wrou?t, ri?t as ?e schal here. Howe Kynge Priamus, aftire his sorowe was asswagede, Edefyede nowe Troye, and it set in þe same place where þe olde stode, so large &amp; so wyde that tofore ne siche was nevere none it lyke. The sorwe aswaged, &amp; þe sy?es olde, By longe processe, liche as I ?ow tolde, Þis worþi kyng, callyd Priamvs, Is in his herte nowe so desyrous, Vp-on þe pleyn, þat was so waste &amp; wylde, So strong a toun of newe for to bilde, At his devyse a cite edefye, Þat schal thassautys outterly defye Of alle enmyes, and his mortal foon, With riche tourys &amp; wallys of hard stoon. And al aboute þe contres enviroun, He made seke in euery regioun For swiche werkemen as were corious, Of wyt inventyf, of castyng merveilous; Or swyche as coude crafte of gemetrye, Or wer sotyle in her fantasye; And for eueryche þat was good devysour, Mason, hewer, or crafty quareour; For euery wri?t and passyng carpenter, Þat may be founde, owþer fer or nere; For swyche as koude graue, grope, or kerue, Or swiche as werne able for to serue With lym or stoon, for to reise a wal, With bataillyng and crestis marcial; Or swiche as had konyng in her hed, Alabastre, owþer white or redde, Or marbil graye for to pulsche it pleyn, To make it smoþe of veynes &amp; of greyn. He sent also for euery ymagour, Boþe in entaille, &amp; euery purtreyour Þat coude drawe, or with colour peynt With hewes fresche, þat þe werke nat feynt; And swiche as coude with countenaunces glade Make an ymage þat wil neuere fade: To counterfet in metal, tre, or stoon Þe sotil werke of Pigmaleoun, Or of Appollo, þe whiche as bokis telle, In ymagerye alle oþer dide excelle; For by his crafty werkyng corious, Þe towmbe he made of kyng Daryus, Whiche Alysaundre dide on hey?t[e] reise, Only for men schuld his fame preise, In his conquest by Perce whan he went. And þus Priam for euery maister sent, For eche keruer &amp; passynge Ioignour, To make knottis with many corious flour, To sette on crestis with-Inne and with-oute Vp-on þe wal þe cite rounde aboute; Or who þat wer excellyng in practik Of any art callyd mekanyk, Or hadde a name flouryng or famus, Was after sent to come to Priamus. For he purposeth, þis noble worþi kyng, To make a cite most royal in byldyng, Brod, large, &amp; wyde, &amp; lest it were assailled, For werre proudly about[en] enbatailled. And first þe grounde he made to be sou?t, Ful depe and lowe, þat it faille nou?t To make sure þe fundacioun; In þe place where þe olde toun Was first ybilt, he þe wallis sette; And he of lond many myle out mette, Aboute in compas, for to make it large, As þe maysters [þat] toke on hem þe charge Devysed han þe settyng and þe syyt, For holsom eyr to be more of delyt. And whan þe soille, defouled with ruyne Of walles old, was made pleyn as lyne, Þe werkmen gan þis cite for to founde, Ful my?tely with stonys square &amp; rounde, Þat in þis world was to it noon lyche Of werkmanschip, nor of bildyng riche, Nor of crafte of coryous masounry. I can no termys to speke of gemetrye, Wherfore as now I muste hem sette a-syde; For dout[e]les I radde neuer Euclide, Þat þe maister and þe foundour was Of alle þat werkyn by squyre or compas, Or kepe her mesour by leuel or by lyne; I am to rude clerly to diffyne Or to discrive þis werk in euery parte, For lak of termys longyng to þat arte. But I dar wel of trouþe affermyn here, In al þis world ne was þer neuer pere Vn-to þis cite, and write it for a soþe, As in his boke my mayster Guydo doth. And þat it my?t in prosperite, In hy?e honour and felicite, From al assaut perpetuelly contune, It reysed was in worschip of Neptune, And namyd Troye, as it was to-forn, Lyche þe firste þat was þoru? Grekis lorn. Þe lenthe was, schortly to conclude, Thre day[es] Iourne, lyche þe latitude, Þat neuer I herd make mencioun Of swiche another of fundacioun, So huge in compas nor of swiche larges, Nor to counte so passyng of fayrnes, So edyfied or lusty to þe sy?t. And, as I rede, þe walles wern on hi?te Two hundrid cubites, al of marbil gray, Maskowed with-oute for sautis and assay; And it to make more plesaunt of delyt, A-mong þe marbil was alabaster white Meynt in þe walles, rounde þe toun aboute, To make it schewe with-Inne and with-oute So fresche, so riche, and so delitable, Þat it alone was incomperable Of alle cites þat any mortal man Sawe euer ?it, sithe þe world began. And at the corner of euery wal was set A crowne of golde with riche stonys fret, Þat schone ful bri?t ageyn þe sonne schene; And euery tour bretexed was so clene Of chose stoon, þat wer nat fer a-sondre, Þat to beholde it was a verray wonder. Þer-to þis cite compassed enviroun, Hadde sexe gatis to entre in-to þe toun: Þe first of al &amp; strengest eke with al, Largest also and most principal, Of my?ty bildynge allone peer[e]les, Was by þe kyng callyd Dardanydes; And in story, lyche as it is fownde, Tymbria was named þe secounde; And þe þridde callyd Helyas; Þe fourte gate hi?t also Cethas; Þe fyfte Troiana; þe syxte Anthonydes, Strong and my?ty boþe in werre &amp; pes, With square toures set on euery syde. At whos corners, of verray pompe &amp; pride, Þe werkmen han, with sterne &amp; fel visages, Of riche entaille, set vp gret ymages, Wrou?t out of ston, þat neuer ar like to fayle, Ful coriously enarmed for batayle. And þoru? þe wal, her fomen for to lette, At euery tour wer grete gunnys sette, For assaut and sodeyn aventurys; And on tourettis wer reysed vp figurys Of wylde bestis, as beris and lyouns, Of tigers, bores, of serpentis and dragouns And hertis eke, with her brode hornes, Olyfauntes and large vnicornes, Buglis, bolys, and many grete grifoun, Forged of brasse, of copur and latoun, Þat cruelly by sygnes of her facys Vp-on her foon made fel manacys. Barbykans and bolewerkys huge, A-fore þe toun made for hi?e refuge, ?iffe nede were, erly and eke late; A[nd] portecolys stronge at euery gate, Þat hem þar nat noon assailyng charge; And þe lowkis þikke, brode, and large, Of þe gatys al of ?oten bras. And with-Inne þe my?ty schittyng was Of strong yrne barres square and rounde, And gret barre[r]ys picched in þe grounde, With huge cheynes forged for diffence, Whiche nolde breke for no violence, Þat hard it was þoru? hem for to wynne. And euery hous, þat was bilt with-Inne, Euery paleys &amp; euery mancioun, Of marbil werne þoru?[-out] al þe toun, Of crafty bildyng &amp; werkyng most roial. And þe he?t was of euery wal Sixty cubites from þe grounde acountid; And þer was non þat oþer haþ surmountid In þe cite, but of on he?t alyche, In verray soþe, boþe of pore and riche, Þat it was harde of hi?e estat or lowe Hous or palys asounder for to knowe, So egaly of tymbre and of stoon Her housis wern reysed euerychon. And if I schulde rehersen by and by Þe korve knottes by crafte of masounry, Þe fresche enbowyng, with vergis ri?t as linys, And þe vowsyng ful of babewynes, Þe riche koynyng, þe lusty tablementis, Vynnettis rennynge in þe casementis— Þou? þe termys in englisch wolde ryme, To rekne hem alle I haue as now no tyme, Ne no langage pyked for þe nonys, Þe sotil Ioynyng to tellen of þe stonys, Nor how þei putten in stede of morter, In þe Ioynturys copur gilt ful clere, To make hem Ioyne by leuel &amp; by lyne, Among þe marbil freschely for to schyne Agein þe sonne, whan his schene ly?t Smote in þe gold, þat was bornyd bri?t, To make þe werke gletere on euery syde. And of þis toun þe stretis large &amp; wyde Wer by crafte so prudently prouided, And by werkemen sette so and deuided, Þat holsom eyr amyddis my?t enspire Erly on morwe to hem þat it desyre; And ?ephirus, þat is so comfortable For to norysche þinges vegetable, In tyme of ?ere, þoru?-oute euery strete, With sugred flavour, so lusty &amp; so swete, Most plesantly in þe eyr gan smyte, Þe Cyte?eyns only to delyte; And with his brethe hem to recomfort, Whan þei list walke hem siluen to disport. And þoru? þe toun, by crafty purviaunce, By gret avys and discret ordynaunce, By compas cast, &amp; squared out by squires, Of pulsched marbil vp-on strong pilleris, Deuised wern, long[e], large, and wyde, In þe frountel of euery stretis syde, Fresche alures with lusty hi?e pynacles, And moustryng outward riche tabernacles, Vowted a-boue like reclinatories, Þat called werne deambulatories, Men to walke to-gydre tweine &amp; tweyne, To kepe hem drie whan it dide reyne, Or hem to saue from tempest, wynde, or þonder, ?if þat hem list schrowde hem silue þer-vnder. And euery hous cured was with led; And many gargoyl &amp; many hidous hed With spoutis þoru?, &amp; pipes as þei ou?t, From þe ston-werke to þe canel rau?t, Voyding filþes low in-to þe grounde, Þoru? gratis percid of yren percid rounde; Þe stretis paued boþe in lengþe &amp; brede, In cheker wyse with stonys white &amp; rede. And euery craft, þat any maner man In any lond deuise or rekene can, Kyng Priamus, of hi?e discrecioun, Ordeyned hath to dwellyn in þe toun, And in stretis, seueryd her and ?onder, Eueryche from oþer to be sette a-sonder, Þat þei my?t, for more comodite, Eche be hym silfe werke at liberte: Howe the goldesmythes, and aftire, every crafft ware disposyde in strete by strete by hem selff. Gold-smythes first, &amp; riche Iowellers, And by hem silf crafty browdereris, Wevers also of wolne &amp; of lyne, Of cloth of gold, damaske, and satyn, Of welwet, cendel, &amp; double samyt eke, And euery clothe þat men list to seke; Smyþes also, þat koude forge wele Swerdis, pollex, and speris scharp of stele, Dartis, daggeris, for to mayme &amp; wounde, And quarel hedis scharp and square [y-]grounde. Þer wer also crafty armoureris, Bow[y]ers, and fast[e] by fleccheris, And swyche as koude make schaftes pleyn, And other eke þat dide her besy peyn For þe werre to make [also] trappuris, Bete baners and royal cote armvris, And by devise, stondardis &amp; penowns, And for þe felde fresche &amp; gay gytouns. And euery crafte þat may rekned be, To telle schortly, was in þis cite. Howe by grete crafft ther was a Ryvere called Zanctus conveyede thorough þe Cyte. And þoru? þis toun, so riche &amp; excellent, In þe myddes a large riuer went, Causyng to hem ful gret commodite; Þe whiche on tweyne haþ partid þe cite, Of cours ful swyft, with fresche stremys clere, And hi?t[e] Xanctus, as Guydo doþ vs lere. And as I rede, þat vp-on þis flood, On eche-asyde many mylle stood, Whan nede was her grayn &amp; corn to grinde, Hem to sustene, in story as I fynde. Þis riuer eke, of fysche ful plenteuous, Devided was by werkmen corious So craftely, þoru? castyng souereyne, Þat in his course þe stremys my?t atteyn For to areche, as Guydo doth coniecte, By archis strong his cours for to reflecte Þoru? condut pipis, large &amp; wyde with-al, By certeyn meatis artificial, Þat it made a ful purgacioun Of al ordure &amp; fylþes in þe toun, Waschyng þe stretys as þei stod a rowe, And þe goteris in þe erþe lowe, Þat in þe cite was no filþe sene; For the canel skoured was so clene, And deuoyded in so secre wyse, Þat no man my?t espien nor deuyse By what engyn þe filþes, fer nor ner, Wern born a-wey by cours of þe ryuer— So couertly euery þing was cured. Wher-by þe toun was outterly assured From engenderyng of al corrupcioun, From wikked eyr &amp; from infeccioun, Þat causyn ofte by her violence Mortalite and gret pestilence. And by example of þis flode þer was Made Tibre at Rome, and wrou?t by Eneas, Þe which also departeth Rome on two, Myn auctor seith, I not wher it be so. Howe kynge Pryam made Cite?ens of foreyns, And [gaf] everich of hem certeyne grounde to belde vpone. And to enhabite þis royal chef cite, Kyng Priam haþ aboute in þe contre Made for to serche, with al his hool entent, And in provinces þat werne adiacent, In borwys, townys, and in smale villages, I-gadred out of al maner ages, And of thropis folkys ful diuers, And swiche as wern vacaunt &amp; dispers, Aboute Troye in any regioun, He maked hath to entre in-to þe toun Gret multitude, what of ?ong &amp; olde, It to enhabite, as ?e han herde me tolde. And hem þat wern afore to hym foreyns, He hath in Troye maked cit[e]?eyns, Ful discretly, liche as it is founde. And whan þei gan with peple [to] abounde, Kyng Priamus, of hi?e affeccioun, After þe bildyng of þis my?ty toun, Haþ in his hert cau?t a fantasye His newe cite for to magnyfye. And it to put þe more in remembraunce, He cast fully to do some obseruaunce To my?ty Mars, sterne &amp; ferse of hewe; And specialy with certeyn plei[e]s newe, On horse and fote, in many sondry wyse, To ?eue his men in kny?thod excersyse, Eueryche to putten oþer at assaye In iustis, bordis, and also in tornay, To preve her force whan þei happe mete. Þe whiche pleies wer fondid first in Crete; And in þat lond, of hi?e &amp; lowe estat, In Martys honour þei wer dedicate. And in palestre, at wakys on þe ny?t, Wern [o]þer pleies men tassay her my?t, Only on fote with many sotil poynt; And some of hem wer nakyd &amp; anoynt; To wynne a prys þei dide her ful entent. And þer was founde, by clerkys ful prudent, Of þe ches þe pleye most glorious, Whiche is so sotil and so meruelous, Þat it wer harde þe mater to discryue; For þou?e a man stodied al his lyve, He schal ay fynde dyvers fantasyes Of wardys makyng, &amp; newe iuparties, Þer is þer-in so gret diuersite. And it was first founde in þis cite, Duryng þe sege, liche as seyth Guydo; But Iacobus de Vitriaco Is contrarie of oppynioun: For, like as he makyth mencioun, And affermeth fully in his avys, How Philometer, a philysofre wys, Vn-to a kyng, to stynte his cruelte, Fond first þis pleie &amp; made it in Calde; And in-to Grece from þense it was sent. Also in Troye, by gret avysement, Þe pleye was first founde of dees &amp; tables, And of castyng þe chaunces deceyvables, Þat han be cause ofte of gret debat: For ?if þat on be nowe fortunat To wynne a while be favour of his chance, Or he be war, with sodeyn variaunce, Vnhappely he is putte abak, And anoþer, þat stood vp-on þe wrak, And of losse was plounged in distresse, Þei reysed han vn-to hy?e ryches; Gladnes of on is to another rage— Adevaunte, hasard, and passage; ?if on haue Ioye, anoþer suffereþ wo, Liche as þe bonys renne to and fro; An hundrid sythe in a day þei varie, Now blaundisschyng, &amp; now þei be contrarie; No man with hem assured is in Ioye. And first also, I rede, þat in Troye Wer song &amp; rad lusty fresche comedies, And oþer dites, þat called be tragedies. And to declare, schortly in sentence, Of boþe two þe final difference: A comedie hath in his gynnyng, At prime face, a maner compleynyng, And afterward endeth in gladnes; And it þe dedis only doth expres Of swiche as ben in pouert plounged lowe; But tragidie, who so list to knowe, It begynneth in prosperite, And endeth euer in aduersite; And it also doth þe conquest trete Of riche kynges and of lordys grete, Of my?ty men and olde conquerou[ri]s, Whiche by fraude of Fortunys schowris Ben ouercast &amp; whelmed from her glorie. Of a Theatyre stondynge in þe princypale paleys of Troye, declarenge the falle of Pryncys &amp; othere. And whilom þus was halwed þe memorie Of tragedies, as bokis make mynde, Whan þei wer rad or songyn, as I fynde, In þe theatre þer was a smal auter Amyddes set, þat was half circuler, Whiche in-to þe Est of custom was directe; Vp-on þe whiche a pulpet was erecte, And þer-in stod an aw[n]cien poete, For to reherse by rethorikes swete Þe noble dedis, þat wer historial, Of kynges, princes for a memorial, And of þes olde, worþi Emperours, Þe grete emprises eke of conquerours, And how þei gat in Martis hi?e honour Þe laurer grene for fyn of her labour, Þe palme of kny?thod disservid by [old] date, Or Parchas made hem passyn in-to fate. And after þat, with chere and face pale, With stile enclyned gan to turne his tale, And for to synge, after al her loos, Ful mortally þe stroke of Antropos, And telle also, for al her worþihede, Þe sodeyn brekyng of her lives threde: How pitously þei made her mortal ende Þoru? fals Fortune, þat al þe world wil schende, And howe þe fyn of al her worþines Endid in sorwe and [in] hi?e tristesse, By compassyng of fraude or fals tresoun, By sodeyn mordre or vengaunce of poysoun, Or conspiringe of fretyng fals envye, How vnwarly [þat] þei dide dye; And how her renoun and her hi?e fame Was of hatrede sodeynly made lame; And how her honour drowe vn-to decline; And þe meschef of her vnhappy fyne; And how Fortune was to hem vnswete— Al þis was tolde and rad of þe poete. And whil þat he in þe pulpit stood, With dedly face al devoide of blood, Singinge his dites, with muses al to-rent, Amydde þe theatre schrowdid in a tent, Þer cam out men gastful of her cheris, Disfigurid her facis with viseris, Pleying by signes in þe peples si?t, Þat þe poete songon hath on hi?t; So þat þer was no maner discordaunce Atwen his dites and her contenaunce: For lik as he aloft[e] dide expresse Wordes of Ioye or of heuynes, Meving &amp; cher, byneþe of hem pleying, From point to point was alwey answering— Now trist, now glad, now hevy, &amp; [now] li?t, And face chaunged with a sodeyn si?t, So craftily þei koude hem transfigure, Conformyng hem to þe chaunt[e]plure, Now to synge &amp; sodeinly to wepe, So wel þei koude her observaunces kepe; And þis was doon in April &amp; in May, Whan blosmys new, boþe on busche &amp; hay, And flouris fresche gynne for to springe; And þe briddis in þe wode synge With lust supprised of þe somer sonne, Whan þe[se] pleies in Troye wer begonne, And in theatre halowed and y-holde. And þus þe ryyt [of] tragedies olde, Priamus þe worþi kyng began. Of þis mater no more telle I can. Howe kenge Priam, aftire his Cite was parformede, ordeynede his paleys princypal, callyd Yllyoun. But I wil furthe of þis story wryte, And on my maner boistusly endyte, How Priamus was passyng dilligent, Ri?t desyrous, and inwardly fervent, ?if he my?t, among his werkes alle, To bilde a paleys and a riche halle, Whiche schuld[e] ben his chose chef dongon, His royal se and souereyn mansioun. And whan he gan to þis werke aproche, He made it bilde hi?e vp-on a roche, It for tassure in his fundacioun, And callyd it þe noble Ylyovn. Þe si?t of whiche, iustly circuler, By compas cast, rounde as any spere— And who þat wold þe content of þe grounde Trewly acounten of þis place rounde, In þe theatre first he moste entre, Takyng þe lyne þat kerueþ þoru? þe centre, By gemetrie, as longeth to þat art, And treblid it, with þe sevenþe part, He fynde my?t, by experience, Þe mesour hool of þe circumference, What lond also, pleynly eke with al, Contened was with-Inne þe strong[e] wal— Þe creste of whiche, wher it lowest was, Hadde in hi?t ful sixe hundred pas, Bilt of marbil, ful royal &amp; ful strong, And many other riche stoon a-mong; Whos touris wern reysed vp so hi?e, Þat þei ra?t almost to þe skye; Þe werk of whiche no man my?t amende. And who þat list by grecis vp ascende, He my?t[e] seen in his inspeccioun To þe boundis of many regioun And provincys þat stoode rounde aboute. And þe wallys, with-Inne and with-oute, Endelong with knottis graue clene, Depeynt with a?our, gold, ?inopre, &amp; grene, Þat verraily, whan þe sonne schon, Vp-on þe gold meynt among þe stoon, Þei ?af a li?t, with-outen any were, As Phebus doþ in his mydday spere— Þe werke of wyndowe, and [eche] fenestral, Wrou?t of berel and of clere cristal. And amyddys of þis Ylyoun, So fresche, so riche of fundacioun, Whiche clerkys ?it in her bokis preyse, Kyng Pryam made an halle for to reyse, Excellyng alle in bewte &amp; in strenthe Þe latitude acordyng with þe lengthe. And of marbil outeward was þe wal; And þe tymbre, most nobil in special, Was halfe of cedre, as I reherse can, And þe remenant of þe riche eban, Whiche most is able, as I dar specefye, With stoon to Ioyne by craft of carpentrie; For þei of tymbre haue þe souereynte. And for to telle of þis Eban tre, Liche in bokys sothly as I fynde, It cometh out of Ethiope and Ynde, Blak as is get; and it wil wexe anoon, Whan it is korve, harde as any stoon, And euermore last[en] and endure, And nat corrupte with water nor moysture. And of [t]his halle ferþer to diffyne, With stonys square by leuel and by lyne It pavid was, with gret diligence Of masownry and passyng excellence. And al aboue, reysed was a se, Ful coriously of stonys and perre, Þat callid was, as chefe and principal, Of þe regne þe sete moste royal. To fore whiche was set by gret delyt A borde of Eban and of yvor whyt, So egaly Ioyned and so clene, Þat in þe werk þer was no rifte sene; And sessions wer made on euery syde, Only þe statis by ordre to deuyde. Eke in þe halle, as it was couenable, On eche party was a dormant table Of evor eke, and þis eban tre; And euen ageyn þe kynges royal see, In þe party þat was þer-to contrarie, I-reised was by many crafty stayre, Hi?e in þe halle, in þe tother syyt, Ri?t as lyne in þe opposyt, Of pured metal and of stonys clere In brede &amp; lengthe, a ful rich auter. On whiche þer stood, of figure &amp; visage Of masse gold, a wonderful ymage, To ben honoured in þat hi?e sete, Only in honour of Iubiter þe grete. And þe statue, for al his huge we?gte, Fiftene cubites complet was of hei?gte, A crowne of gold hi?e vp-on his hed, With heuenly saphirs &amp; many rube red Fret enviroun, with other stonys of Ynde; And among wer medled, as I fynde, Whyte perlis massyf, large, &amp; rounde; And for most chefe al dirkenes to confounde, Was a charbocle, kyng of stonys alle, To recounfort &amp; gladyn al þe halle, And it tenlumyn in þe blake ny?t With þe freschenes of his rody li?t. Þe valu was þer-of in-estimable, And þe riches pleynly incomperable; For þis ymage, by diuisioun, Was of schap and proporcioun From hed to foot so maisterly entayled, Þat, in a point, þe werkeman haþ nat failed It to parforme by crafty excellence. Whom Priamus, with drede and reuerence, Honoured hath aboue þe goddys alle, In al meschef to hym to clepe &amp; calle; For in hym was his hool affeccioun, His souereyn trust and deuocioun, His hope also, and his affyaunce, His heile, his Ioye, and his assuraunce; And his welfare and prosperite He hath commytted to his deite, Wenyng in hert wonder sekerly, To ben assured from al meschef þer-by, And diffended in eche aduersite, And hold his regne in hi?e Felicite, And in honour continuelly to schyne, Whil Iubiter, þoru? his power diuyne, Hym and his hath in proteccioun— Þis was his trust and ful oppinioun. And þus þis werke finally acheved, Wher-of Priam, with Ioye ful releued, Þat he his cite and noble Ylyoun Hath fully brou?t vn-to perfeccioun, Liche his entent, whan þat he began. And þus Priam, þis kyng, þis worþi man, Ful many day in [t]his newe Troye, With his liges lad his lyf in Ioye, Wher I hym leue in his royal sete Souereynly regnynge in quiete, Procedyng forþe, ?if ?e liste to here, Vn-to þe effect anoon of my matere. Howe kynge Priamus, aftire that he had parfytlye parformede and ymade his Cyte, by þe serpente Of Envye was stirede and Inwardly mevede to bygyne A newe werre vpone the Grekes. O hatful harm, whiche most is for to drede! Kyndled so long, o spark of old hatred, Rote of debate, grounde of envie and Ire, With new[e] flawme hertis for to fyre! O grayn of malys, causer of al offence! O rancour rustid of inpacience, Whiche hast of new made festrid soris smerte! Whan þou art onys rakid in a herte, Whiche for disdeyn of mercy maist nat lete A man no while to lyuen in quiete, But delvist vp by malis many-fold Debatis new, þat biried wern of olde, And falsely quikest strives to restore— Þenvious serpent þat was slaw of ?ore, Whiche felly hath, þis addre envyous, Out of his rest awakyd Priamus, And with his venym, so persyng &amp; so ille, Made him wery to lyuen in tranquille, And mevid hym, of his iniquite, Vp-on Grekis avenged for to be. For wher-as he in pes held his reigne, With his legis in Ioye souereigne, With-oute anoy or any perturbaunce, Þis serpent hath with new[e] remembraunce, With-out avis, or discret arest, So hoot a flawme kyndeled in his brest Of old envie with fresche rancour meynt, Þat likly is neuer to be queynte. For Priam now in his entencioun Cast &amp; compaseth, revolvyng vp &amp; dovn, How strong he was of riches &amp; meyne, How noble &amp; my?ty was also his cite, And abundaunte, schortly to conclude, Boþe of plente and of multitude, Of men of armys and of chevalrye. Whiche sterid hym to han a fantasye, Allas þe while, to his vnhappy chaunce, Þat to be ded he take wil vengaunce Vp-on his foon; þe fire of hot envie So brent hym inward by mallencolye, Stondyng in purpos, þat no man chaunge may, Of his damages avenged be som day, And of Iniuries þat þei on hym han wrou?t. And whan þat he had a tyme sou?t To his purpos moste conuenient, A-noon he hath for alle his lordis sent, And his kny?tes callyd euerychon To com in hast, excused was nat on, Namly, of hem þat wern of hi?e degre. And þei obeying, with alle humilite, His biddyng holly, &amp; made no delaye, To com echon ageyn a certeyn day; And his sones wern also present, Ector except, þat was þat tyme absent In þe strong and my?ty regioun Of Panonye, whiche in subieccioun Kyng Priam helde, þoru? his worþines; And to amende þinges and redres, Ector was goon in-to þis Panonye, Certeyn causys for to iustefye, As in his resoun he þou?t[e] for þe best, To setten hem in quiete and in rest. For he was ay so iust and so prudent, So wel avised and so pacient, And so demenyd in his gouernaunce, Þat hym was loth for to do vengance, Wher-as he my?t in esy wyse trete For to reforme þinges smale &amp; grete; For lothe he was, þis noble worþi kny?t, For any haste to execute ry?t, Or causeles by rigour to condempne. And in þis while, ful worþi and solempne, Kyng Priamus, of lordis grete and smale, With-Inne Troye helde a courte royal, As he þat list for no cost to spare; And ceryously his menyng to declare, He in his see, his lordis enviroun, Gan þus to schewe his hertis mocioun: Howe kynge Priamus in opyne declarethe þe harmes done to his progenye &amp; hym by the Grekes. “O worþi lordis, þat ben [now] here present, Feithful and trew of hert &amp; of entent, Is nat vnknowe to ?our discrecioun Þe grete damagis and oppressioun Whiche þat Grekis han vp-on vs wrou?t, With-oute cause, for a þing of nou?t, Þis other day, as who seith but late, Þat, as I trowe, so new is ?it þe date, Þat it is fresche remembrid in ?our mynde, Vn-to ?our blood ?if þat ?e be kynde. For I suppose, no for?etilnes May put a-way þe mortal hevines Of harmys olde, whiche ay renewe ageyn In my memorie, I seie ?ow in certeyn; And as I trow, pleynly in ?oure þou?t, Þat euer is grene, and ne dieth nou?t, How þei haue slayn oure progenytours Þat whilom wern so noble werreours, Oure cite brent and brou?t vn-to ruyne, And robbid it, falsely by ravyne, And turned al in-to wyldernes, And in-to Grece caried oure riches, My fader slayn, þat hi?t[e] Lamedoun, With-out[e] cause or occasioun, And rau?t from hym his gold &amp; his tresour, Whiche me semeth is a foul errour. We my?t of ri?t amendis wel chalenge, And desyren vs iustly to revenge A-fore þe goddis of so hi?e offence, Only of resoun and of conscience. And passyng alle her mortal cruelte, Þer is o þing most inly greveth me, Þat þei vngodly, ageyn[e]s gentilnes, No rewarde havyng to þe worþines, To þe birth, nor þe royal blood Of hir þat is so fayr and eke so gode— I mene my suster, callyd Exyoun— Whom þei, allas, to her confusioun, Disuse and kepe nat lik hir degre, From day to day in dishoneste; Wher-þoru? hir honour &amp; hir name is lorn, Considryng nat of what stook sche was born. For þei ar blynde for to taken hede, Or to aduerte þe rote of hir kynred, Of surquidye þei be so indurat. And sith þat sche, of so hi?e estat, I-tretid is, liche as ?e may se, I suppose other, þat ben of low degre, Gouerned ben ful dishonestly; For ?e may þinke and deme trew[e]ly How wyvis, maidenes, in þat companye, With oþer eke þat ben of ?our alye, I-haunted ben and vsed at her lust; On þe Grekis I haue no better trust, For þei ne spare nouther blood nor age. And þus þei lyue in torment &amp; seruage, With-out routhe, mercy, or pite, Þe whiche toucheþ ?ou as wel as me; And as me semeth, of equite and ri?t, ?e ou?t echon with al ?our ful[le] my?t, Of þe wronges with whiche ?e ben offendid, To seke a weye it my?t[e] ben amendid: And þat we werke, alle be on assent, And procede, liche to oure entent, On her malis and cursed cruelte, Alle attonys avengid for to be; And þat we be in hert[e], wille, and þou?t Of on acorde, and ne varie nou?t, For þan our force is doublid &amp; pouste. For ri?t and resoun &amp; good equite Require vengaunce on hym þat doþ þe wrong, Þou? it so be þat it abyde longe. I trust also on goddis ri?twisnes, Þat þei schal help oure harmes to redres, And fauour us in oure Innocence, To chastyse hem þat wrou?t[e] þis offence. Also ?e knowe howe þat oure cite Is strong and my?ty, &amp; of gret surte, With touris hi?e and walles for þe werre, Þat also fer as schyneþ sonne or sterre, Þer is noon lyk, for to rekne al, Þat may in force ben þer-to perigal. ?e knowe also, as it schal be founde, With cheualrie how þat we abounde, Expert in armys and of olde assaied, Þat for drede neuer wer dismayed; And we haue plente also of vitaille, Of frendschip eke, þat ne wol not faile With al her my?t to don to vs socour. Wherfor I rede, with-oute more soiour, To sette vp-on, sithen we be able, And tyme is now, me semeth, couenable; For manhod bit make no delaye To venge a wrong, hap what hap[pe] may. For in differryng is ofte gret damage, To werke in tyme is double avauntage; For to oure purpos lakketh neuer adel, And þoru? oure manhod we ben assured wel. But list we ben [not] holden to hasty, Or to rakil to werke wilfully— And werre also stant in aventure, For ay of Marte dotous is þe Ewre— I rede, first to Grekis þat we sende To wit ?if þei our harmys wil amende, With-out[e] strif, werre, or more debat: Þan may we sayn þat we ben fortunat; And ?if þei be contrarie to resoun, To condiscende to þis conclusioun, To graunte oure askyng of equite &amp; ri?t, Þan haue we cause for to preve our my?t. But or þat we procede by rigour, We schal to hem offeren al mesour, As fer as ri?t and resoun eke require; And of disdeyn ?if hem list nat here, Þan oure quarel, devoide of wilfullenes, I-roted is vp-on sikernes. And ?if þat we of her gret offence Axe amendis first in pacience, God and Fortune, I hope, wilne assent, In þe ende we schal vs nat repente; And it is bet by pes to han redresse, Þan gynne a werre with-out avisenesse. Þer-fore, lat vs our woful aventure Paciently suffren and endure, And in our port be but humble &amp; pleyn, Vp-on answer what þat þei wil seyn. For þou? so be, in myn entencioun, I meved am by iust occasioun To procede of ire to vengance, I wil al put out of remembrance, And lete slyde be for?etilnes Þe wrongis don, &amp; voide al hevines To-ward Grekis, and of hem axe no more, But þat þei wil Exyona restore To vs ageyn, whiche is to me most derre, Only to stint al debat and werre. For þe surpluse of our mortal Ewre We schal dissymvle, &amp; prudently endure Our harmys olde forþe in pacience, ?if ?e acorde [vn-]to my sentence: Seythe her-vp-on, as ?e ben avised; For ?if þis sond be of hem despised, And þat hem list to resoun nat obeye, Þan we may iustly seke anoþer weye To han redres, for now þer is no more, Saue I purpose to sendyn Anthenor, Whiche is a man discrete and avisee, And specialy in mater of trete, For he is bothe wyse and eloquent, As ?e wel knowe, &amp; passyngly prudent.” Howe kynge Priam, by the advyce of his lordes, sente Anthenore into Grece for restitucyoun of Exioun. And whan þe kyng had told his tale anon To his counseyl þei consent euerychon, Þat Anthenor þis Iourne vndirtake. And he in hast gan hym redy make, With-oute abode, and nolde nat denye To take on hym þis embassetrye, Wel avysed in his discresioun, Toke or he went informacioun From poynt to poynt of þis gret[e] charge; For he hym cast to stondyn at his large, With-oute errour, as he þat koude his gode; For he þe effect ful pleynly vndirstode; For euery þing he prented in his þou?t Or þat he went, and forgat ri?t nou?t; For of a word he cast hym nat to faile. To schip he goth and began to sayle, And in schort tyme, he &amp; his companye, Arived ben vp in Thesalye, At a cite callyd Mynusyus, Wher by fortune was kyng Pelleus Þe same tyme; &amp; Anthenor anoon Vn-to þe kyng þe ri?t[e] weye is goon. Of whom he was, as Guydo haþ conseived, At prime face benignely receyved; But whan he knew þe cause of his commyng, He bad in hast, with-oute mor tariyng, To Anthenor, with a fel visage, Schortly to seyn þe effecte of his message. This Troyan kny?t, astonyed neuer-adel, But ful demvr and avised wel, Nat to hasty nor rakel for to seyn, But abidynge with loke and face pleyn, To Pelleus, with a manly chere, Seide in effect ri?t þus as ?e schal here: “Þe worþi kyng, callid Priamus, So wyse, so noble, so manly, and famus, And of kny?thod passyng excellent, Hath first to ?ou in goodly wyse sent, Out of Troye, his royal chefe cite, His ful entent &amp; message her by me, As I schal seyn to ?ou in wordis pleyn, ?if it so be þat ?e nat disdeyne Paciently to ?even audience. Remembryng first in ?our aduertence Of þe harmys nat ful longe a-go, And þe wrongis þat ?e wrou?t also, Ful cruelly, with oþer eke of ?ours, In Troye lond on his progenitours, What Iniuries and distruccioun, Causeles, with-oute occasyoun, ?e schewed haue of verray cruelte, And merciles distroyed his cite, Slayn his fader, named Lamedoun, And his cite brent and bete doun, And nouþer left paleis, hous, nor tour, And lad a-wey his riches and tresour, And nouþer spared, as I reherse can, In ?our slau?ter womman, child, nor man, Þer my?t[e] non from ?our swerd astert. And ?it o þing þat most he haþ at hert, Þat his suster, called Exyoun, Is hold and kepte of kyng Thelamoun, Dishonestly, ageyn al genterye, To gret dishonour &amp; gret velenye Of her kynred, liche as ?e may se, Tretid nor cheresschid lyk to hir degre! Wherfor, sith ?e be so wyse a kny?t, ?e ou?t aduerte and to haue a sy?t To swyche þinges, of iust affeccioun, And considre in ?our discreccioun, Of gentilnes and of equite, How swiche wrongis my?t amendid be. Wherfor Priam, of gret avisenes, As he þat fully with al his besynes Of hert and wille desireþ pes &amp; rest, Sendeth to ?ou, besechyng for þe best, Þat ?e wil don ?our besy diligence, To make to hym þis litel recompense, Þat he may haue restitucioun, Þoru? ?our kny?[t]ly medyacioun, Of his suster, with-oute lenger space; And þe remenaunt he wil lete pace, Strif and werre only to eschewe. For he desyreth fully for to sewe Pees and quiete, of hool affeccioun, And to pursew mesour and resoun, And finally, liche as ?e may se, Al occasioun of werre for to fle; Consydereth þis, þat hold[e] ben so sage, For þis þe fyn fully of my massage.” Whan Pelleus hym pleynly vnderstod, Of sodeyn Ire he wexe in hert[e] wood, Of cher and loke fel and furious, And of rancour ri?t melencolyous, Þat he ne my?t [a]tempre nor apese Þe hasty fir þat gan his hert[e] sese; For he anoon, in ful dispitous wyse, Gan Priamus threten and dispise, And of malis sette his sond at nou?t, With all þe menys þat Anthenor haþ sou?t, And gan also þis Troyan kny?t manace, And bad in hast he schuld[e] voide his place, Vp-on peril þat after falle my?t. And he anoon went out of his sy?t; And in al hast, he and his meyne, With-oute abood, taken han þe se, And gan to sailen oute of Thesalye, And in her weye so fast[e] þei hem hy?e, Þat in schort tyme þei arived be Vp at Salempne, a my?ty strong cite, Wher be fortune in þis royal toun, Þis Anthenor fond kyng Thelamoun, And to his palys he haþ þe wey[e] nome. And first, I fynde, whan þat he was come, He was accepte[d] vn-to his presence, Benyng[e]ly with-oute[n] al offence; For Exion was present in þat tyde, Of auenture stondyng by his syde. And at reuerence of hir womanhede, Of Antenor he toke þe better hede, Al-be of custom þat kyng Thelamoun Had hi?e dispit and indignacioun Of euery Troyan þat he coude espie; For specialy to hem he had envie, Of rancour only, þoru? þe bitter rage, Whiche in his hert my?t[e] neuer asswage. But for al þat, he in pacience To Anthenor haþ ?even audience; Þe whiche anoon, in ful sobre wyse His tale gan, as I schal deuyse: “Sir,” quod he, “with support of ?our grace, So ?e me graunt opportune space, For to declare þe cause of my commyng, I wil reherse with-out more tarying My mater hool, brefly in sentence, To make it kouþe to ?our magnificence, Signefying, with-out[e] displesaunce, Þat Priamus, whiche haþ [þe] gouernaunce Of Troye toun, hath vn-to ?ow sent Of feiþful menyng and of clene entent, Besechyng first to ?our goodlyhed, Alle other wronges for?etyn &amp; eke ded, Þat ?e only, of ?our hi?e nobles, Of equite, and of gentilnes, ?e wil restore Exyona ageyn, Whiche þat ?e hold, to speke in wordis pleyn, In verray soth, nou?t like to hir estat. Wherfore, he preyeth to stynten al debat, And euery harme to put out of memorie, Of kyngly honour for ?our owne glorie, To send hir hom and make deliueraunce Goodly of hir with-outen variaunce, Whom ?e han holde so many long[e] daies. Ne tarieth nat, ne setteth no delayes, Ne lete in ?ow be founde now no slowþe; For sothfastly it is to gret a routhe To recorde how ?e haue hir vsed, It may of trouth nat goodly ben excused. But we schal lete li?tly ouerslyde, So þat ?e bening[e]ly prouide To sende hir hom, lik as I haue seyd. Loo, her þe charge þat was on me leide, With-oute more abydyng in certeyn, What godly answer ?e wil send ageyn.” Whan Thelamoun herkned had his tale, Of hasty Ire he gan to wexe pale— Þe fyry colre hath hym made so wode, Þat from his face a valid was þe blood, Whiche in his hert gan to frete &amp; bite— With lok askoyn, &amp; tornyd vp þe white, Of hi?e disdeyn, with face dispitous, With pale smylyng &amp; lau?tre furious, Gan rakyn oute þe felle mortal fire Of fretyng hate, þat brent in his desire, And schortly made, in conclusioun, To Anthenor þis obieccioun, And seide, “frend, what-euer þat þou be, I wondre gretly, &amp; mervail is to me, What auenture or sodeyn newe þing Vnprudently meveth now þi kyng Vn-to me to make swiche a sonde; Þou wer a fole, whan þou toke on honde, Outher vnhappy or infortunat, To me to bryng þis embassiat; For I with hym haue no þing a-do, Nor he wit[h] me, and loke þou seye hym so; For we ne ben aqueynted but a lyte, Nor I no þing platly me delite, At schorte wordis, ?if þou list to here, To don for hym, [n]or at his prayere; For I ne haue Ioye nouþer feste To do ri?t nou?t, sothly, at his request. Þis wote I wel, þat but a while ago I was at Troye, my silfe and other mo, For to reforme [a] þing þat was amys, Þoru? ?our offence, schortly, þus it is; For certeyn þing wrou?t by Lamedoun. And by our manhood we wan þer þe toun, And slow þe kyng &amp; alle þat with hym hilde, In kny?tly wyse hym metyng in þe felde; And for þat I, as eueryche my?t[e] se, Dide entre first in-to þat cite, It was to me graunted for memorie, In signe only of myn hi?e victorie, With-outen any contradiccioun, By alle þe Grekis to haue pocessioun Of hir þat is to me most entere, Exiona, whom þou cleymest here. But be wel siker, þin askyng is in veyn; For trust[e] wel, &amp; be ri?t wel certeyn, Þou gest hir nat, at o word, ?if I may; For þer schal first be made ful gret affray Or I hir leue duryng al my lyve, Who euer grucche or þer ageyn[es] striue It wer nat sittyng me to leue hir so, For whom I had whilom so gret ado Or I hir gat with spendyng of my blood; And who þat be wroþ þer-with or wood, I wil hir kepe, as it schal be founde; For whom I had so many mortal wounde At Troye toun, or þat I hir wan. And in good feith, as ferforþe as I can, Sche schal nat li?tly from myn hondis passe; For sche allone stant so in my grace For hir bewte and hir semylyhed, For hir bounte and hir goodlyhed, Þat ?if I schal my resoun schortly fyne, Sche is in sothe þe moste femy[ny]ne Þat euer I sawe, and with-outen drede, Of port, of konnyng, &amp; of womanhede, Sche haþ alone, in verray existence, Þe souereynte and þe excellence; Þat Priamus, for ou?t þat þou canst seyn, Whil þat I lyue get her not ageyn, But he hir bye with many dedly wounde, With scharp[e] swerdis and square speris grounde. For þer schal first be reysed soche a strif, Þat it schal cost many a man his lif, Or [þat] sche ageyn restored be; Take þis for soþ, þou gest no more of me. Whan hym list he may wel be-gynne; But I suppose he schal but litel wynne, Noon oþer wyse but as I þe tolde. And wost [þou] what a gret fool I þe holde, The to putte so fer in iupartye, To execute þis embassatrye, Þe manly Grekis so boldly to offende; Be war þer-for, þat he no more þe sende, Vp-on þi lyf, for rancour nor for pride. Now go þi weye; for ?if þat þou abyde Any lenger, sothly, in my si?t, Þou wost þe pris of þat I haue þe hi?t; Þou skapest nat, who þat be lef or lothe.” Þanne Anthenor anoon to schip[pe] goth, And to saille hym list nat to delaye, Toward an yle þat callyd is Achaye; And whan þat he taken hath þe lond, At his ryuail of auenture he fonde Þe worþi kynges, Pollux and Castor; And ri?t anoon þis Troyan Anthenor With-oute abood to þe court is fare, Vnto hem his message to declare; And to-gydre whan þei were present, Ry?t þus he seide, as in sentament: “Þe nobil kyng of Troye þe cite Hath vn-to ?ou sent his wille by me, Besechyng ?ou in ful lowe maner Þat ?e list vn-to his prayer Of equite for to condescende, And goodly helpyn a certeyn wrong to amende, Touchyng his suster, callid Exyon, Þat he may haue restitucioun Of hir ageyn, by ?our discrete avyse. For sith ?e ben so manly and so wyse, It likly is, in his oppinioun, Þat by ?our good[e] mediacioun, Sche li?tly may ageyn restored be, For to cherische pes and vnite. Wherfor he prayeþ with al his hert enter, In goodly wyse to doon ?our deuer, Þat hold[e] ben so kny?tly and so sage, And he wil pleynly al þe surplusage Of wrongis olde puttyn in suspence; For he desyreth, of kyngly hi?e prudence, To stint[e] werre &amp; to norische pes; For he is nouther rakle nor rekles, But avisee, in his werkis alle, To cast aforn what [þat] schal [be-]falle, And þinges future aduertyng from a-ferre, And seth what perel þat þer is in werre, Wil hym conforme vn-to pes &amp; rest; For he conseyueth þat it is þe best, Euery man vnite to sewe, And prudently also to eschewe Of debatis ecche occasioun. Lo, here þe fyn of his entencioun, Whiche I commytte to ?our Iugement.” And Castor þan, of ire impacient, For hastynes ne my?t[e] nat abide, His cruel hert so swolle was with pride, Brak out anon with a dispitous face, And seide: “frende, I knowe of no trespas Þat Grekis dide euer vn-to þi kyng; To axe amendis, it is a wonder þing, Of vs þat neuer dide hym noon offence, Saue þat we made a maner recompense Of a wrong wrou?t by Lamedoun, Þe whiche first sou?t occasioun Ageyn[es] Grekis, in vngoodly wyse; Þat caused vs vp-on hym to ryse, Al attonys, and manly on hym sette, Of due ri?t for to quite oure dette. Liche his decert we han hym [pleinly] serued, And no þing wrou?t, but as he haþ disseruyd. To axe amendis he gynneþ now to late, For we couet more his mortal hate, His outter malis, and his enmyte, Þan ouþer pes, acord, or vnite; As in effect her-after he schal fele, ?if it hap[pe] þat he with vs dele; Þe bargan schal ful dere ben abou?t; And we his frenschip, soþly, set at nou?t. And ouer-more, I speke now to þe, It likly is, as semeth vn-to me, Þat Priamus þe louyd but a lite, Nat þe valu, I suppose, of a myte, Whan he þe sent vp-on þis message; And þou of foly dedist gret outrage, To take on þe so hi?e a perlous þing, Vn-to Grekis to bryng[e] swiche tydyng, Wher-þoru? þi lif is putte in iupartie. But I counsel fast[e] þat þou hi?e Out of my si?t, list þat þou repente.” And Anthenor furthe to schippe went, And with þe wynde gan to seyle anoon Toward an yle callid Pillyon; And in al hast, whan he dide ariue, He schope hym forþe to þe court as blyue, Wher duk Nestor, in al maner þing, His housholde held, royal as a kyng. And Anthenor, ful sadde and avisee, To-for Nestor sittyng in his see, Whan þat he was amytted for to seyn, His tale he tolde ful opinly and pleyn, From point to point, as ?e herd a-fore; It wer but weyn to reherse it more, For he alwey concluded hath in oon, Liche as ?e herde, touching Exyon. But duk Nestor, with face no þing red, But of hewe as any asche deed, Fret with col[e]re so inwardly was he, Þat his blood from eche extremyte Withdrawen is, doun vn-to his hert, Whiche for Ire so sore made hym smert, Þat he gan quake in euery Ioint &amp; veyne, Þat he his hond vnneþe may refreyne, For malenkolye avenged for to be; Lik a lyon, so wood &amp; wroþe was he, Fer from hym silf he was so alienat, And inwardly of rancour passionat, With loke reuersed, furious of si?t, Þat tempre hym silf onneþis he ne my?t; He felt of anger so greet aduersite. And amyddes al his cruelte, Of sodeyn hast attonys he out brak, And even þus to Anthenor he spak: “O þou,” quod he, “with alle þi wordis white, As I suppose, [þat] þou wost ful lyte Vn-to fore whom þou hast þi tale tolde; For I merueile how þou art so bolde To presume myn eris to offende; And for Priam so proudly to pretende A maner title in þi kynges name, Þe worþi Grekis for to putte in blame, And vniustly, of foule hardynes, Requere of hem [for] to han redres Of Iniuries wrou?t on Lamedoun, Boldly affermyng, of fals presumpcioun, Vp-on Grekis wrongis outragious, Whiche in myn eris ben so odious, So fretyng eke, so byting and so kene, For to list þat I may nat sustene, In myn heryng so hateful is þe soun; Þat, nere þe honour of myn hi?e renoun Refreyned me, I schulde in cruel wyse Execute ful hastely iustyse, Þoru? þe rigour of my mortal lawe, With bestys wilde first to do þe drawe, And þer-vp-on, for þi fayned tale, Dismembre þe al on pecis smale, In dispite of Priamus þi kyng, To techen oþer to bringe more tydyng, Presumptuously, or any talis newe, To any lord, but þei þe bet hym knewe. Þis schulde be for þi presumpcioun Þi last[e] mede and final guerdoun, With-out mercy, lik as I haue behi?t. And in al hast, be go out of my si?t! For outerly it doþ to gret offence Vn-to myn ey to haue þe in presence, For þoru disdeyn it causeth myn vnrest.” Þan Anthenor þou?t[e] for þe best, It was not holsom lenger to abide, But cast wysly, for rancour or for pride, Þat it was best for to bern hym feyre, And to his schippe he gan anoon repeyre, And in al hast by possibilite, With-oute abood he taken haþ þe see, And gan to seyle &amp; homward fast[e] drawe. But sodeynly boilen gan þe wawe, Þe see to ryse, and þe clowdes blake For tappere, and þe wynde a-wake; Wonder gastful also was þe heuene With dredful fire of þe bri?t[e] leuene; Þe þonder smot, þe tempest gan to dryue, Þat þe mast gan a-sonder riue. Now aloft, nowe in poynt to drowne, Þe fel[le] wedir gan so on hem frowne, Þat þei awaite not but vp-on deth, Euene at þe point of ?eldyng vp þe breth, For þei ne sawe noon oþer remedye. And euer-among, þei gan clepe and crye To her goddes, and avowes make, And devoutly for to vndertake, Eche of hem, liche as he was of age, ?if þei eskape, to gon on pilgrymage, Lyche þe ritys of her paynym wyse, To þe goddis to doon her sacrifise, So as þei werne of substaunce &amp; of my?t. And sodeynly þe wedir, dirke as ny?t, With new[e] ly?t by grace gan adawe; Þe se wexe calme, &amp; smoþe gan þe wawe, So þat of hap, among hem euerychon, For al þe tempest, persschid was not on; But to-fore Troye, with-Inne a litel space, Þei ben aryved euerychon by grace, Eskapid safe from euery Iupartye, Boþe Anthenor and al his companye. And to þe temple he toke þe ri?te waye, And in his prayer þer ful long he lay, With many another also for his sake, Þankyng her goddis, þat made hem so eskape Euery perel and tempest of þe see. And aftir þis, vn-to þe kyng goth he, Þat with his lordis aboute hym ful royal, In his palys and dongoun principal Sat and abod, ful solempnely, Trewe report of þis embas[sa]trye; And þis kny?t, of al þat hath hym falle, Hath tolde þe kyng to-forne his lordis alle. Howe Kynge Priamus, aftire that Athenore had declarede to-fore hym and his lordes the contraryous answere of the Grekes, lete set his parlament, to wit what was to be done. This Anthenor haþ first made mencioun, To-fore þe kyng by iust relacioun, Of his expleyt, by ordre by and by, And in what wyse &amp; how vncurtesly, He was receyued of kyng Pelleus, Of þe thretis and wordis dispitous, Þat he suffred of kyng Thelamoun, Beying as fers as a wood lyoun; And afterward, he gan also compleyne Of [þe] dispit of þe brethre tweyne, Of his rebuke and his gret[e] drede, And at Nestor howe he dide spede, Þat with his lif he my?t vnneþes skape: Al þis he told, &amp; gan an ende make Of his Iourne and eke of his repaire. And þan Priam was fully in despayre, Outher by sorte or [by] auenture, Euere ageyn his suster to recure; For he conseyueth in his aduertence, By clere report of expert evidence, Þat ay þe more he was to hem benigne, Þe more vngoodly ageyn hym þei malygne; And wher he most him schewith debonaire, Þer he fynt hem ageynward most contraire, So frowardly euer þei hem quyte, Schewyng by signes þat þei sette lyte By his frendschip, for au?t he coude aduerte. Wherof he was pure sory in his hert, Þat he constreyned, [ri?t] of verray nede, Compelled was iustly to procede To han redres only by rigour; For profre of pes my?t haue no fauour To be admytted, be title of ri?twisnes, Þoru? hi?e dispit of hasty wilfulnes; For euery mene of mesour was in veyn, Saue only werre engendred by disdeyn, Be-gonne &amp; caused al of old hatrede. Whiche gan anon swiche a brond to brede Of new envie in þe kynges breste, Þat Priamus, with-oute more areste, Is so inly with Ire and rancour fret, And with disdeyn so sore grounde &amp; whet, Þat wher so be, þat he lese or wynne, Vp-on Grekis he wil a werre be-gynne, And Iupart, manly as a kny?t, His lyf, his deth, by-cause he had[de] ri?t. And cast hym first a naue for to sende In-to Grece his fomen for toffende; And liche a kny?t his force for to hante, In kny?tly wyse he cast hym for to daunte Þe pompe of Grekis and þe sturdines, And finaly her pride to oppres. But seye, Priam, what infelicite, What new[e] trouble, what hap, what destyne, Or from a-boue what hateful influence Descendid is, by vnwar violence, To meue the, þou canst not lyue in pes! What sodeyn sort, what fortune graceles, What chaunce vnhappy, with-oute avisenes, What wilful lust, what fonnyd hardynes, Han putte þi soule out of tranquillite, To make þe wery of þi prosperite! Whi hast þou sauour in bitter more þan swete, Þat canst nat lyue in pes nor in quyete? Þou art travailed with wilful mocions, Ouermaystred with þi passiouns, For lak of resoun and of hi?e prudence, Dirked &amp; blind from al prouidence, And ful bareyn to cast a-forne and see Þe harmys foloyng of þin aduersite! Þou wer to slow, wisely to consydre; For want of si?t made þe [to] slydre, Þoru? myst of errour falsely to forveye By pathis wrong from þe ri?t[e] weye, To voyde resoun of wilful hastynes! Wher was þi guyde, wher was þi maistres, Discrecioun, so prudent and so sad, Avisely þat schulde þe haue lad From þe tracis of sensualite; Þou? it ful selde in mannys power be, By suffraunce hym siluen to restreyne, Whan sodeyn Ire doth his hert[e] streyne. Þou schust a-forn bet ha cast þi chaunce, Wrou?t by counseil &amp; nat put in balaunce Þi sikernes—allas! whi distow so?— And haue symuled somdel of þi wo, And cast þi chaunce wel a-fore þe prime, To haue forgoten wrongis of old tyme, And þou?t a-forn in þin aduertence, Þat ofte falleth in experience, Þat whyles men do most besynes Vengably her wrongis to redres, With double harme, or þat þei ar ware, Þei falle ageyn in a new[e] snare; And damages þat wer for?ete clene, By fals report of rumour fresche &amp; grene Renewed ben, þoru? þe swifte fame, Þat fleth so fer to hindre a lordis name; Namly, whan þei to a purpos wende Only of hed, and se nat to þe ende: For of pride and of sodeyn hete, Þei voide hem silf out of al quiete, Aduerting nat to wirke avisely, Nor þe prouerbe þat techeth commounly, “He þat stant sure, enhast hym not to meve”; For ?if he do, it schal hym after greue; And he þat walkyth surly on þe pleyn, ?if he stumble, his wit is but in veyn; But if so be, he list of his foly Be necligent to putte hym wilfully In aventure, and of hym silf ne reche, Teschewen perel, I hold he be a wreche. For sothly, Priam, þou wer to rek[e]les, For to comytte þi quiete and þi pes, So dredfully, duryng by no date, To cruel Fortune or to fikel fate; Whos maner is, of costom comounly, Þat whan a man trusteth most souereynly On þis goddesse, blind &amp; ful vnstable, Þan sche to hym is most deceyueable, Hym to abate from his royal stalle, And sodeynly to make hym doun to falle, And with a trip, þrowe hym on þe bake, Who þat geynstryueth schal haue litel tak. Sche is so slei?ty with hir gynny snare, Þat sche can make a man from his welfare, With hir panter, þat is with fraude englued, Whan he lest weneth for to be remewed. Þerfor, no man haue noon affyance In Fortune, nor in hir variaunce; Ne late no wi?t his ese more Iupart— List þat þe pleye wil afterward departe— To turne his chaunce ouþer to wel or wo: For selde in oon sche doth þe gamen go, As ?e may se be example of Priamus, Þat of foly is so desyrous To wirke of hede &amp; folwe his oune wille, To trouble, allas, þe calm of his tranquille— As in [t]his boke here-after schal be founde— Hym and his cite platly to confounde, And outterly to his confusioun; Þat afterward, by long successioun, It schal be rad in story and in fable, And remembrid, with dites delytable, To do plesaunce to hem þat schal it here: Þat be example þei may be war &amp; lere, Of hasty lust or of volunte, To gynne a þing which in noun-sur[e]te Dependeth ay, as strif, werre, and debate; For in swiche pley vnwarly comeþ chek-mate; And harme y-done to late is to amende, Whos fyn is ofte other þan þei wende— In þis story as ?e schal after seen. And late Priam alwey ?our merour ben, Hasty errour be tymes to correcte. For I anoon my poyntel wil directe, After þe maner of his tracis rude, Of þis story þe remnaunte to conclude. Howe Kenge Priam, in opyne parlement toforne his lordes, schewede the answers that Anthenor brought. This worþi kyng, euer of o sentence, Ay more &amp; more fired with feruence, Hath his breues and his letters sent For his lordis to holde a parlement, And hem commaundid, in al [þe] hast þei may, To com anon at her assigned day From euery ward and party of þe toun, For to assemble in noble Ilyoun, Chef of his regne; &amp; whan þei were echon With hym present, þis noble kyng anon, To-forn hem alle, as schortly as he can, His wille declareþ, &amp; þus he be-gan: “Sirs,” quod he, “be-cause ?e ben wyse, It nedeth not long proces to deuyse, For to reherse of ?our comyng cause; But for to telle, schortly in a clause What I mene, and make no delay, ?e wote how I, now þis oþer day, Sent in-to Grece, by conseil of ?ow alle, A kny?t of myn þat Anthenor men calle, To haue recured Exyona ageyn. Whos message was [nat] but in veyn; For of Grekis ful vncurteisly He was resseyued, and dispitously Þrat &amp; rebuked, in poynt to haue ben ded: Vnneþe he my?t eskapyn with his hed, Þei put on hym swiche offence &amp; blame, Þat reboundeþ to oure alder schame. And day be day it mot encresen more, But we ordeyn sum remedie þer-fore; For þer as we al mesour han hem offerid, Þei haue to vs werre &amp; strif [I-]proferid, Of hey? dispit, of rancour, &amp; of hete, And of malis cruelly vs threte. And, wher-as we wold[e] pes purchace, For wrongis don, þei felly vs manace; And for þe harmys þat þei han vs wrou?t, Þei nat purpos, pleynly in her þou?t, Other redres nor amendis make, But outerly with werre vs to awake, Whos Ioye is fully encres of our greuaunce. So wold[e] God, þei wer with repentaunce Contrit in hert to stynten al meschef, Þat lykly is to fallyn, &amp; þe gref On outher part, þat it my?t ouer-slide; But þei, allas, with rancour &amp; with pride Ar swolle of newe to þreytyn more &amp; more. But God diffende, haluendel þe sore By infortune euere scholde falle As þei purpose on eny of vs alle. But syth þei han schapin þus for vs, We mote resisten her wille malicious, Þoru? my?t of God, of necessite, In oure defence—it wil noon oþer be; And best I holde vn-to oure entent To wirche and don, alle by on assent, So we oure purpos sonest schal acheue. Wher is discorde, þer may no querel preue; For on þat part wher hertis be nat oon, Victorie may in no wyse goon; Chef of conquest is pes and vnite, Ri?t as discorde is of aduersite; On hed of hertis makeþ rewmys sure, Diuisioun causeth discounfeture. Wherfore, I rede, of o wille and hert Lete vs set on to do þe Grekis smerte; For sothfastly, ?if ?e list to se, I dar afferme þat we strenger be Þan þe Grekis vp-on euery part, And han of armys parfitly þe art, And ben acounted of kny?thod crop &amp; rote, And plente han of men on hors &amp; fote, Arrayed wel, eueryche in his degre; And þer-with-al, so strong is oure syte, For to with-stond our fomen euerychon— ?ow counseilyng to ordeyn anon, First tassemble holy oure navye, And stuf hem strongly with oure chevalrie, And in-to Grece hastily hem sende, Þe proude Grekis manly to offende; And of iust cause &amp; be title of ri?t, Hem werreyn with al oure ful[le] my?t, Her townes brenne, &amp; her feldes waste— With herte vnfeyned also vs enhast To quiten hem as þei deserued haue. For be my red, we schal noon of hem saue, But cruely take on hem vengaunce. Ne hath no fer, ne lat be no grevance, Þou? þei a-forn by fortune wer victours, To sleen our auncetris and progenitours; For he þat was of vnhap first put doun, Remounteþ ofte to ful hi?e renoun, By þe chaunge and þe variance Of werre &amp; strif, þat euer is in balance. For he þat is þis day assurid wel, To-morwe he is caste doun of þe whe[l]; Þe victor ofte putte in auenture, And venquysched by discomfeture Of hym þat he hadde aforne victorie. Now vp, now doun, in armys stant þe glorie; In Martys chaunce no man hym assure, But as it cometh lat hym take his vre; For gery Mars, by his influence, Can ?eue a man whilom excellence To wynne a pris, liche a conquerour, And sodeynly, as a somer flour, He can his honour maken for to fade. For, whan þat he his aspectis glade Fro a man listeth for to writhe, His renoun old goth a-weye as blyve; After a flowe, an ebbe folweth ay; As men disserue, preise hem for a day. For þou? Phebus þis day merie schyne, To-morwe he may his bemys doun decline Þoru? þe þiknes of þe mystis trouble; Ri?t so of Mars arne þe chances double— Now vp, now doun, now lowe, now olofte— As Fortune, whiche þat chaungeth ofte, List on hir whele make a man ascende, And vnwarly doun ageyn descende, Stoundemel his honour to avaunce, And with a swy?e þrow hym to meschaunce; Now with favour sette hym vp ful hi?e, Efte avale hym, with twynklyng of an eye. Hir pley vnstable turneþ as a bal, While on goth vp, an-other hath a fal; Sche reiseth on, &amp; doth anoþer loute, For euery man, whan it cometh aboute, Mote take his turne, as hir pleye requereþ. Who is expert and hir fraudes lereth, Schal with hir sugre finde galle meynt, And hir hony ay with bitter spreynt— In pes and werre, in honour &amp; in fame, In dignetes, in resoun, and in schame, At hir likyng, as hir list to graunte; Þerfor no man his hap to moche avaunte. For þou? Grekis whilom wern a-lofte, It may her-after hem hap ful vnsofte. Wherfore, echon schewe ?oure worþines, Þat so ar named of strenþe &amp; hardynes, And to Fortune pleinly ?ow committe, And late no fere ?oure manly hertis flitte, But stondeth hool &amp; beth in menyng pleyn, And here-vp-on, lat se what ?e wil seyn.” And attonys her voys þei gonne reise, And his sentence hi?ly for to preyse, And of on hert, manly gon expresse, Þei wil dispende goodys &amp; richesse, And her bodies put in iupardye— Þer was nat on þat wolde it þo denye. And of þis graunt he þanketh hem echon, And ?af hem leue wher hem list to gon; For he dissolued hath his parlement. And euery man on his weye is went, And repeired to his mansioun, The kyng allone lefte in Ylyoun, Sool by hym silf inwardly mvsyng, How his purpos he my?t aboute bryng; For he in soth on no þing ellys þou?t, And þer-vppon euene þus he wrou?t. Howe Kynge Priamus callede his sonnes to his presence, and in secrete wyse lamentabyly opynyd and declarede his intollerabyle sorowes, askenge þer avyce in avengeinge his cause. Kyng Priamus, makyng þus his mone, As I ?ou told, in a chambre alone, Many weyes castyng vp and doun, For to parforme his conclusioun, And to fulfille þe fyn of his entent; He first of alle prudently hath sent For his sonys to com to hym in hast, As wel for hem þat wer borne in bast, As þe toþer, for tassemble y-fere For a purpos, liche as ?e schal here, To haue a counseil for nedful puruyaunce, Ageyn[e]s Grekis to maken ordynaunce, First by hem silf allone priuely. And whan þei were in ordre by &amp; by, Eueryche of hem sette in his due see, Liche as þei werne of age &amp; of degre, And Hector first, flour of cheualrie, Repeired hom oute of Panonye, Moste acceptable in euery wy?tes grace, Nexst his fader taken hath his place; And whan Priam his leiser dide espie, With sy?es sore, castyng vp his eye, To hem echon sittyng enviroun, Gan to declare his hertis mocioun. But first, or he my?t his wil expowne, In-to teris he gan hym silf[e] drowne; His hertly wo was so outragous, Þat for wepyng &amp; sobbyng furious, Vnneþe he my?t with any word out-breke, Nor vn-to hem, for distresse, speke, Nor openly his inward menyng schewe, Til at þe laste he in wordis fewe Gan to abreyde, in al his pitous fare, Euene þus his menyng to declare: “My dere sonys, so lovyng &amp; so kynde, As I suppose, þat ?e haue in mynde, And remembre discretly, and aduerte, And enprente ful freschely in ?our hert, How þe Grekis, ageyn al ri?t and lawe, With cruel swerde mordrid han &amp; slawe Our worþi auncetris, of ful hi?e renoun, And distroyed, brent, &amp; bete doun Þe first[e] Troye, with his wallis olde; And how vngodly also þat þei holde Myn oune suster, callid Exyoun, To ful gret schame and confusioun, And hi?e repref to ?our worþines, Þat, me semeth, of verray kyndenes, And of nature ?e ou?t to ben agreued, And inwardly in hert[e] sore ameved, To suffren hir, in hyndring of hir name, So to be tretid, for ?our alder schame. Allas! why nyl ?e do ?our besynes, Þis hi?e dispit kny?tly to redresse, ?ow for to avenge vp-on her cruelte, Recure to fynde of her iniquite, Sith þat ?e be so my?ty and so strong! Certis, me semeth, ?e byden al to long, Fro daye to day þat ?e so differre, In kny?tly wyse to gynne on hem a werre, ?our force &amp; my?t manly to assaye. I am pure sory þat ?e list delaye ?ow to conferme vn-to my desyre— Þat in her hate brenne as hoot as fyr— Vp-on hem, lyche as ?e may se, Of fretyng Ire avenged for to be, Liche her desert to quiten hem her mede. And ?e, allas, take list non hede, Whil ?our renoun doth so freschly schyne, Vn-to my lust ?our hertis to encline; Consyderyng, liche as it is kouthe, How I haue fro ?our grene ?outhe I-fostred ?ow &amp; brou?t ?ou forth echon, Fro þilke day þat ?e koude goon, As tenderly as I koude or my?te. To whiche þing, in ?our inward si?t, ?e schulde aduerte alweye new &amp; new, And of nature on my soores rewe, To remedien myn aduersite, Whiche toucheþ ?ou al so wel as me, Sith [þat] ?e wot how sore it doth me greue, ?e schuld[e] schap myn harmys to releue.” And sodeynly, as he þus gan morne, Toward Hector he gan his face torne, And seid, “Hector, my trust &amp; al my Ioye, Myn eyr also, likly to regne in Troye After my day, and be my successour, And named art þe verray souereyn flour Of worþines, and of manhod welle, And alle þi brethre in kny?thod dost excelle, And in armys, liche a conquerour, Callid þe stok of worschip and honour, I hertly praye, þou? þou sitte stille, Be willy now my purpos to fulfille, To execute þat I desyre so; For fynally, in þe and in no mo Is ful my feith to bryng[e] þis aboute. Now take on þe, &amp; be no þing in doute, To be chef prince &amp; also gouernour Of þis purpos, and outerly socour; In-to þin hond þis Iourne I committe, Hooly of hert, so þat þou ne flitte, Þe to conferme, by good avisement, To parforme vp þe fyn of myn entent. For of resoun, best to þe it sitte, Whiche art so prudent &amp; so ful of witte, Strong &amp; delyuer, flouryng eke in ?outhe, Of whom þe fame þoru? þe worlde is kouth, ?ong of ?eris, old of discrecioun, Ewrous to love, passyng of renoun, Vn-to whos wille þi breþre schal obeie, And stond with þe, boþe to lyue &amp; deye! Now condescende tacomplische my request, And what þou felist, answere at the best.” And whan þe kyng haþ schewed his sentence, Demvre of chere, humble of reuerence, Þis worþi Hector, example of gent[e]rie, With softe speche, as techeþ curtesye, His answere ?af, with sobre countenans, Þeffect of whiche was þis in substauns: [T]he answere of Ector [t]o his faders demannde. “Myn owne lord, and my fader dere, Benignely ?if ?e list [to] here, After þe force and þe grete my?t, And þe somme of naturis ri?t, Whiche euery þing by kynde doth constreyne In þe boundis of hir large cheyne, It fittyng is, as sche doth enspire, And acordyng þat euery man desyre Of wrongis don to han amendement, And to hir law ri?t conuenient; Namly to swiche þat with nobilite Kynd hath endewed, &amp; set in hi?e degre; For to swiche, gret repref is and schame, Whan any wrong be do vn-to her name; For eche trespas mote consydered be, Iustly mesurid after þe qualite Of hym þat is offendid, and also, After þe persone by whom þe wrong is do; Be it in werre, in contek, or debate: For gretter gref is to hi?e estate To suffre an harme, of cas or auenture, Or any wrong vniustly to endure, Or Iniuries compassed of malys, Is more offence, by discret avys, To hem þat ben famous in manhod, Renomed, &amp; born of gentyl blood, Þan to swiche on þat holde is but a wreche. Wherfore, we most [gretly] charge and reche, Only of kny?thod oure worschip for to eke, Of wrongis don amendis for to seke, Oure staat consydered &amp; oure hi?e noblesse, And in what plyte we stonde of worþines, Whan þat bestis, of resoun rude and blinde, Desire þe same by instynt of kynde. And for my part, trusteþ in certeyn, ?e haue no sone þat wolde halfe so feyn Vp-on Grekis avenged ben as I: For here my trouth, I seye ?ow feithfully, For Ire of hem I brenne as doþ þe glede; I thurst her blood more þan other mede; For ri?t as I eldest am of age Among ?our sonys, so am I most with rage I-fret with-Inne, iustly of kny?thood, With my ri?t hond to schede þe Grekys blod, As þei schal fynd, paraunter or þei wene, Whan tyme cometh, þe soþe schal be sene. But first I rede, wysely in ?our mynde To cast aforn and leue nat be-hynde, Or ?e be-gynne, discretly to aduerte And prudently consyderen in ?our herte Al, only nat þe gynnyng but þe ende, And þe myddes, what weie þei wil wende, And to what fyn Fortune wil hem lede— ?if ?e þus don, amys ?e may nat spede. For þat counseil, in myn oppinioun, Is worþi litel, by discrecioun, To haue a pris, þat cast nat by and by Þe course of þinges by ordre ceryously, What weye þei trace to wo or to delite; For þou? a gynnyng haue his appetite, ?et in þe ende, pleynly þis no fable, Þer may þing folwe, whiche is nat commendable. For what is worþe a gynnyng fortunat, Þat causeth after strif and gret debat? Wherfor, in soþe, principles are to drede, But men wel knowe what fyn schal succede; For a gynnyng with grace is wel fortunyd, Whan ende and myddes aliche ben contunyd. But whan þat it in wele ne may contene, It is wel bet by-tymes to abstene Þan put in doute þat stant in surete; For who-so doth hath ofte aduersite. But humblely to ?our estat royal, Of hert I praye, lat nat offende at al, Þat I am bolde to seie my mocioun; For in good feith, of noon entencioun, I no þing mene ?ow to don offence; But only þis, þat ?our magnificence Procede nat of hede wilfully, Ne þat no spirit ?ou meue folyly To gynne þing þat after wil ?ou schende, For lak þat ?e se nat to þe ende, Nor taken hede in ?oure aduertence, To consydere by good prouidence, How Grekis han in her subieccioun Europ &amp; Aufrik, with many regioun, Ful large &amp; wyde, of kny?thod most famus, And of riches wonder plentevous, Ri?t renomed also of worþines. With ?our support þat I dar wel expresse, Ful perlous is displese hem or disturbe; For ?if þat we oure quiete now pertourbe, Whiche stant in pes, gretly is to drede; For þou? al Asye help vs in our nede, ?if it be lokid on euery part ari?t, Þei be nat egal vn-to Grekis my?t; And þou? also myn aunte Exioun Ageyn al ri?t be holde of Thelamoun, It is nat good for hir redempcioun, To putte vs alle to destruccioun. I rede nat to bien hir half so dere; For many of vs, in hap þat sitten here, And oþer mo, my?ten for hir sake Deth vnderfonge, &amp; an ende make; Whiche were no wisdam, liche as semeþ me. And it may happen also how þat sche In schort tyme hir fatal cours schal fyne, Whan Antropos þe þrede a-two schal twyne. What had we wonne þanne &amp; sche wer go, But enmyte, þou?t, sorow, &amp; wo, Slau?ter of oure men, deth &amp; confusioun! Wherfore I rede, by dissymulacioun, With-oute more þat we oure wo endure— And nat to putte oure silf in auenture— Þis hold I best—&amp; wirkyn as þe wyse. But dout[e]les, for no cowardyse I seie nat þis in ?oure hi?e presence, But for cause I hold it no prudence, To Fortune, ful of doubilnes— Sith we be sure—to putte oure sikernes: Þis al &amp; som, þeffect of al my wille.” And with þat worde Hector held hym stille. Aftire that Ector had shewede his entente, Paris declaryde his dreme of þe golden Appyle. And whan Hector, by ful hi?e prudence, Concluded haþ þe fyn of his sentence, Ful demurly he kepte his lippis cloos. And þer-with-al Parys vp a-roos, And gan his tale þus a-fore þe kyng: “My lord,” quod he, “so it be lykyng To ?oure hi?nes for to taken hede, As me semeth, we schuld litel drede In kny?tly wyse for to vndirtake Vp-on Grekis a werre for to make, Al attonys her pride to confounde; Sith þat we passyngly habounde Of chiualrie, here with-Inne our toun, And haue plente and pocessioun Of eche þing þat may to werre a-veile, Stuf in our silf and ryal appareile Of al þat longeth to assautis marcial, And with al þis, more in special, Help &amp; socour of many regioun, With vs to werke to her destruccioun, Þe pompe &amp; pride manly to abate, And of Grekis þe malis for to mate; For al þat þei of hert[e] ben so stoute, Me semeth schortly þat we dar nat doute, Nor on no part for to be dismaied. Wherfor I rede, lat nat be delaied Our schippes first redy for to make, And I my silf wil fully vndirtake, So it to ?ou be lykyng and plesance, Of þis emprise hoolly þe gouernaunce, And ?ow assuren &amp; putte in certeyn Exyona to recure ageyn. And in what forme þat it schal be wrou?t, I haue a weye founden in my þou?t, Þat likly is here-after to be don, Whiche vn-to ?ow I wil declare anoon: First, I haue cast, with strong &amp; my?ty hond For to rauysche som lady of þat lond, Of hey?e estat, and make no tarying, And my?ttyly in-to Troye hir bring, Maugre her my?t, for þis conclusioun, Þat ?e may haue restitucioun Be eschange of hir þat ?e desyre so. And here-vp-on schal be no long a-do, I ?ou behete, for al þe Grekis strong. And for þat I schal ?ow nat prolonge, I wil ?ow seyn, excludyng euery dout, How þis avis schal be brou?t aboute: First, how þat I schal þis purpos fyn, Þe goddis han þoru? her power devyne Schewed to me be reuelacioun; For þer-vppon I had a visioun But late agoon, as I ley and slepe, Vn-to whiche ?if ?e taken kepe, ?e may not faile nor be in no dispeire To han recur of hir þat is so faire, For whom ?e haue now so moche care. And þe maner hol I wil declare Of þis drem to ?our magnificence, ?if it so be ?e ?eue wil credence To my tale, for I schal not dwelle Ceriously in ordre for to telle Þe trouþ[e] pleyn, &amp; no fable feyn, To ?ow þat ben my lord most souereyn. Howe the god Marcurye brought with hym the thre ladys, Iuno, Venus, and Pallas, to-for Paris lyenge in the wod aslepe; and of the thre gyfftis that they promysed hym for þe apple. First, ?if þat ?e remembryn in ?our mynde, Þis oþer day, whan I was last in Ynde, By ?our avis &amp; commaundement, For a mater whiche in ?our entent Was specialy had in cher[i]te, As it is kouþe atwixe ?ou and me, Of whiche I toke [vp-]on me þe charge In þe boundis of þat lond ful large, Þe same tyme ?our desyre to spede— Whan þat Tytan, with his bemys rede, From Gemmyny drof his chare of gold Toward þe Crabbe for to take his holde, Whiche named is þe paleys of Dyane, Þe bente mone þat wexe can &amp; wane; Whanne halwed is þe sonnys stacioun, Ni?e þe myddes of þe moneþ of Ivn— At whiche sesoun, erly on a morwe, Whan þat Phebus, to voide ny?tes sorwe, Doth Pirrous hys wayn ageyn vp drawe, And Aurora estward doth a-dawe, And with þe water of hir teris rounde Þe siluer dewe causeth to abounde Vp-on herbis and on floures soote, For kyndely norissyng boþe of crop &amp; rote, Vp I roos [out] of my bedde anoon, Ful desyrous on huntyng for to goon, Priked in hert with lusty fresche plesance To do to Loue some due observaunce, And Lucyna þat day to magnifie, Which callid is lady of venarye, And duely oure rytis to obserue, Cithera and hir[e] for to serue, I and my feris, oure hertis to releue, Cast vs fully til it drowe to eve, In þe forest to pley vs and disport, And pleasauntly vs to recomfort, As it longeþ to loue of lustines. For þilke day to Venus þe goddes I-sacrid was, by ful gret excellence, With gret honour &amp; due reuerence Doon vn-to hir, boþe of on and alle; And on a Fryday þis auenture is falle, Whan we gan hast vs to þe wodis grene In hope þat day som gam[e] for to sene, With gret labour rydyng to and fro, Til we hadde ful many buk &amp; do By strengþe slaw, as we my?t hem fynde, Þe hert I-chasid with houndis &amp; þe hynde Þoru? þe downys &amp; þe dalys lowe, Til bri?t[e] Phebus of his daies bowe Amyd þe arke was of meridyen, Whan his bemys ful hote wern &amp; schene, And we most besy wern vp-on þe chas, Þan me byfil a wonder diuers cas. For of fortune it happed sodeynly, Whil I was seuery[d] fro my company, Sool be my silf among þe holtis hore, To fynde game desyrous, euermore, Or I was war, þoru? þikke &amp; [þoru?] þinne, A ful gret hert I sawe a-fore me renne, Dovn by þe launde and þe walys grene, Þat I in soth my?t[e] nat sustene, He was so swyft, for to ni?e hym ner, Al-be þat I priked my courser Ni?e to þe deþ, þoru? many sondri schaw, Out of my si?t so fer he gan with-drawe, For al þat euer [þat] I sewen my?t, Þat I anoon lost of hym þe si?te In a wode þat Ida bare þe name. And I so feynt gan wexen of þat game, And myn hors on whiche I dide ryde, Fomyng ful whit [vp-]on euery syde, And his flankis al with blood disteyned, In my pursute so sore he was constreyned With my sporis, scharp and dyed rede, After þe hert so priked I my stede, Now vp, now doun, with a ful besy þou?t; But my labour availed me ri?t nou?t, Til at þe last, among þe bowes glade, Of auenture I cau?t a plesaunt slade, Ful smoþe &amp; pleyn, &amp; lusty for to sene, And soft as velwet was þe ?onge grene— Wher fro myn hors I [a]li?t as faste, And on a bowe I his reyne cast, So feynt &amp; maat of werynes I was, Þat I me laide doun vp-on þe gras, Vp-on a brink, schortly for to telle, Be-syde a riuer and a cristal welle. And þe water, as I reherse can, Like quik-siluer in his stremys ran, Of whiche þe grauel &amp; þe bri?t[e] stoon As any gold ageyn þe sonne schon. Wher ri?t anon, for verray werynes, A sodeyn slep gan me so oppresse, Þat fro tyme þat I first was born, I neuer was a-slepe[d] so to-forn; And as I ley I hadde a wonder sweuene: For me-þou?t hi?e doun fro heuene, Þe wynged god, wonderful of cher, Mercuryus, to me dide appere, Of whom I was somdel first a-ferde; For he was girt with his crokyd swerde, And with hym brou?t, also in his honde, His slepy ?erde, plyaunt as a wonde, With a serpent goyng enviroun. And at his fete, also lowe a-doun, Me sempte also þat þer stood a cok, Singyng his houris trewe as any clok. And to þe mouthe of þis god Mercurie, Wer pipes sette, þat songe wonder merye; Of whiche þe soote sugred armonye Made in myn eris swiche a melodye, Þat me sempte þo in myn avis, I was ravisched in-to paradys. And þus þis god, diuers of liknes, More wonderful þan I can expresse, Schewed hym silf in his apparence, Liche as he is discriued in Fulgence, In þe book of his methologies, Wher be rehersed many poysyes And many liknes, liche as ?e may se. And for to take þe moralite:— His longe ?erde, ri?t as is a lyne, Whiche on no syde wrongly may decline, Signefieth þe prudent gouernaunce Of discret folke, þat þoru? her puruiaunce Cast a perel or þat it be-falle; And his pipes, loude as any schalle, Þat þoru? musik ben entvned trewe, Betokeneþ eke, with many lusty hewe, Þe sugred dites, by gret excellence, Of rethorik and of eloquence, Of whiche þis god is souereyn &amp; patroun; And of þis cok þe soote lusty sovn, Þat iustly kepeþ þe houris of þe ni?t, Is outerly þavise inward si?t Of swiche as voide by waker dilligence Oute of her court, slouþe &amp; necligence; And his swerd, whiche crokeþ so ageyn, Þat is nat forged nor [y-]made in weyn, Is to reuoke to þe ri?t[e] weye Swiche as wrongly fro trouþe do forveye; And þe serpent, whiche þat I of tolde, Whiche wrinkled is, as ?e may beholde, Vp-on þe ?erde and aboute goth, Signefieth þat falshede wood &amp; wroth Lith in a-weyt by many slei?ty weye, With his gynnes trouþe to werreye. And þis god, of elloquence kyng, Brou?t with hym, eke in his commyng, Cithera, whom louer[e]s serue, Iuno, and Pallas, þat callid is Minerue. And þis Venus, her legis to delite, Aboute hir hed hadde dowes white, With loke benigne and eyen deboneyre, Ay flikeryng with snowy wyngys fayre, For to declare, sothly in sentence, By þe dowes verray Innocence Of hem in loue þat but trouþe mene, And þat her grounde schulde honest be &amp; clene, I-tokenyd is, clerly be witnes, With-out soillyng or any vnclennes; And þe fresshnesse of þe roses rede, Þat in somer so lustyly do sprede, And in wynter of her colour fade, Signyfieth þe hertly þou?tis glade Of ?onge folkis þat ben amerous, Feruent in hope, &amp; inly desyrous, Whan loue gynneþ in her hertis flour, Til longe proces makeþ hem to lour With þe wynter of vnweldy age, Þat lust is pallid &amp; dullid with þe rage Of febilnes whan somer is a-goon, As folkys knowe, I trowe mo þan on; And þerfor Venus fleteth in a se, To schewe þe trowble and aduersite Þat is in Loue, and his stormy lawe, Whiche is beset with many sturdy wawe, Now calm, now rowe, who-so takeþ hede, And hope assailled ay with sodeyn drede. And next Venus, Pallas I be-helde, With hir spere and hir cristal schelde, And a raynbowe rounde aboute hir hed, Þat of colour was grene, blew, and red; And a-forn hir, as I can discryue, Sche growyng had a grene fresche olyue; And þer-vppon, with his browes fowle, In þe brawnchis I sawe sitte an owle. And first þe scheld of Pallas, þe goddes, Signified, as I can expresse, In vertu force, by manly hi?e diffence Ageyns vices to maken resistence; And hir spere, scharp &amp; kene grounde, By iust rygour was forged to confounde Hem þat be false, and to putte a-bake; And for þat mercy schal medle with þe wrak, Þe schaft, in soth, schaue was ful pleyn, List merciles þat ri?t ne wrou?t in veyn; And after werre to make a ful reles, Þer was þe olyve þat betokneth pes; Þe owle also, so odyous at al, Þat songis singeth at festis funeral, Declareth pleynly, þe fyn of euery glorie Is only deth, who hath it in memorie; And þe raynbow grene, red, and pers, Signifieth þe changis ful diuers Þat ofte falle in werre and bataille, Now to wynne and sodeynly to faille, Now stable as blew, chaunging now as grene, For Pallas play is alwey meynt with tene. And alderlast, as I haue in mynde, With hir nymphes, Iuno cam be-hynde, Whiche of custom, as Fulgens[e] tellis, Abide in flodis and in depe wellis. And þis Iuno, as poetis seyn, A mayden is, and of frute bareyn; And þe pecok to þis fresche quene I-sacrid is, with his feþeris schene, Splayed a-brod as a large sail, With Argus eyen enprented in his tail. Þe water rennyng in riuer and in flood, Is þe labour þat men haue for good, Þe gret[e] trouble and þe besynes Þat day &amp; ny?t þei suffre for ryches; Þat who þat euer in þis flodis rowe, Lat hym be war, for ay after þe flowe, Of nature, ri?t as it is dewe, Folwyng þe mone þe[r] mote an ebbe sewe; Þe most[e] drede is ay vppon þe fulle, List Fortune þe fresche feþeris pulle Of riche folke þat schyne in gold so schene, Sith sche of chaunge lady is and quene. And Argus eyen, þat ar sette be-hynde, In nygard hertis be oft[e] sythes blynde, Whiche nat aduerte of goodis to þe ende, Þat liche an ebbe sodeynly wil wende, Whyche þei no þing consydren in her si?t; For as þe faire lusty fetheris bri?t Of a pecok vnwarly falle a-wey, Ri?t so riches, schortly at a day, Wiln her maister sodeynly forsake, Seyn a-dieu, and her leue take. And as Iuno bareyn is of frute, Ri?t so nakid, bare, and destitute Ar þes gredy hertis couetous, Whiche to gadre ben so desyrous, Þat in no þing can haue sufficiaunce, Þe fret of drede hem putte in swiche meschaunce, Ymagenyng þat þe world wil faille; And in her fere ageyn þe wynd þei saille, Til [al] attonys þei mote go þer-fro. And þus of good ay þe fyn is wo, Namly of hem þat so pynche &amp; spare: For þis no drede, as clerkis can declare, Þe frute of good is to spende large; And who is manful, set but litel charge To parte frely his tresour in comovne, Whan he discretly seth tyme oportune. He hath no Ioye to put his good in mwe; For an hert þat fredam list to sewe, Of gentilnes takeþ noon hed þer-to. And in þis wyse, Pallas and Iuno, With fresche Venus, ben a-doun descended, Liche as I haue schortly comprehended, Vnder þe guying of Mercurivs, Whiche vn-to me gan his tale þus: Howe Parys yaf þe golden appele to Venus, and howe sche promysed hym to rekyvere Heleyne. ‘Parys,’ quod he, ‘lifte vp þin eye and se! Loo, þis goddesses here in noumbre thre, Whiche fro heuene with her eyen clere So diuersly vn-to the appere, Wern at a fest, as I þe tellyn schal, With alle þe goddis aboue celestial, Þat Iubiter held at his owne borde. Was non absent only saue Discord; And for dispit sche was not þer present, To be avenged sche sette al hir entent, And in hir wittes many weyes sou?t, Til at þe last, euene þus sche wrou?t, Of poetis liche as it is tolde: Sche toke an appil rounde of purid gold, With greke lettris grauen vp &amp; doun, Whiche seide þus, in conclusioun, With-oute strife þat it were ?ove anon To the fairest of hem euerychon. And of Discord þis lady &amp; goddes, As sche þat is of debat maistres, Hath þis appil, passyng of delit, Brou?t to þis fest, of malis and despit, And cast it doun among hem at þe bord With deynious chere, spekyng not a word; But on hir weye fast[e] gan hir hi?e. And sodeynly so prive gret envie In-to þe court þis appil hath in brou?t, So gret a werre &amp; swiche a contek wrou?t In þe hertis of þis ilke thre, Þat after long may not staunched be; Among hem silf so þei gan disdeyn Whiche in bewte was most souereyn, And whiche of hem haþ best title of ri?t For to conquere þis bornyd appil bri?t. And first þei gan þus for bewte striue, Þat of rancour her hertis almost ryue, To wit of ri?t who schuld it first possede— Loo, ?it envye regneth in womanhede, Þat on is fayrer þan anoþer holde; For eche woman of hir kynde wolde Haue on som part pris a-boue anoþer, In eche estat, in soth it is noon other. And eche of hem, in her owne avis, Hath Ioye in bewte for to han a pris; For non so foule doth in a myrour prye, Þat sche is feir in hir owne eye. But liche a fool he hym silf doth quite, Þat awmber ?elwe cheseþ for þe white. A gowndy eye is deceyued sone, Þat any colour cheseþ by þe mone; For som colour is with fir made fyn, And som encresid with spicis &amp; with wyn, With oynementis and confeccions; And on ny?t, by false illusiouns, Somme appere wonder fresche and faire, Þat loke dirke a day-li?t in þe eyre. Þer is no pref but erly by þe morwe, Of swiche as nede no bewte [for] to borwe, But as Nature hath hir silf disposed. Þerfore fastyng, or boystis ben vnclosyd, Make þi choyse, liche as bit Ovide, Whan euery drogge &amp; pot is set a-syde, List þat þou be, after his sentence, Deceyvid li?tly by fals apparence, For now-a-dayes swiche craft is ful rife. And in þis wyse þus be-gan þe stryf Be-twixe Iuno, Venus, and Pallas, Þat be descendid for þis sodeyn caas, By on assent, towching her bewte, Þe dom þer-of comitted vn-to þe. I speke to þe, þat callid art Parys, And holdyn art ri?t prudent &amp; ri?t wys, Be avysed how þi dom schal fyne; For þei ne may to nor fro declyne, But obeie, alle, by oon assent, With-oute strif to þi Iugement. But herk[e], frist, or þat þou procede, Of eche of hem what schal be þi mede, Considere ari?t, &amp; take good hede þer-to: ?if þou þe appil graunte vn-to Iuno, Sche schal þe ?ef plente of riches, Hi?e renoun, of fame eke worþines, With habundaunce of gold &amp; of tresour, And do þe reise to so hi?e honour, Þat þou allone alle oþer schalt excelle, For þi guerdoun, liche as I þe telle. And ?if to Pallas, goddesse of prudence, Þe liste þe fyn conclude of þi sentence, Þat sche may lady of þe appil be, For þi mede sche schal assure þe, Þat of witte and of sapience Þou schalt hooly han þe excellence, And of wisdam and discrecioun, To discerne by clernes of resoun; Also fer as Phebus cast his li?t, Þer schal nat be a more prudent kny?t, Nor in þis world, sith þat it began, Of iust report a manlier man, Nor to þi name noon equipolente. And ?if to Venus, of trew &amp; clene entent, Þe list to graunt, in conclusioun, Of þe appil to haue pocessioun, Þe fresche goddes, þat sit so hi?e aboue, Schal þe ensure to haue [vn-]to þi loue Þe fairest lady þat is or was to-fore, Or in þis world euer schal be bore; And in Grece þou schalt hir kny?tly wynne. Now be avised or þat þou be-gynne, Iustly to deme, and for no þing spare.’ And I anoon gan loken vp and stare, Gretly astoned what me was best to do, Til at þe last I spake Mercurye to, And seide, certeyn, þat I ne wolde there ?euen no dom, but þei naked were, So þat I my?t haue ful[ly] liberte Eueryche of hem avisely to se, And consyderen euery circumstaunce Who fairest wer vn-to my plesaunce, And goodliest, to speke of womonhede, And after þat to my doom procede. And þei anoon, as ?e haue herde me seie, To my desyre mekely gan obeie, In al hast to don her besy cure Hem to dispoille of cloþing &amp; vesture, Liche as þe statut of my dom hem bonde: In a poynt, þei nolde it not withstonde, Þat I my?t haue ful inspeccioun Of forme &amp; schap &amp; eche proporcioun, For to discerne, as I can remembre, Avisely by ordre euery membre, And þanne at erst to iugen after ri?t. But whanne þat I of eche had a si?t, I ?af to Venus þe appil ri?t anoon, Be-cause sche was fairest of echon, And most excellyng, sothly, of bewte, Most womanly &amp; goodly on to se, As I dempte pleynly in my si?t. For þe stremys of hir eyen bri?t, I-liche glade and egal euene of li?t Wern to þat sterre þat schewith toward ny?t, Whiche callid is Esperus so schene, Venus hir silf, þe fresche lusty quene. Þe whiche anon, þis heuenly Emperesse, After my doom, of hertly hi?e gladnesse, Þat of þe appil sche hooly haþ þe glorie, And wonyn hit iustly by victorie, Reioysched hir more þan I can telle, Þat sche hir feris in bewte dide excelle. And sche in hast, of trewe affeccioun, Concluded haþ, fully for my guerdoun, Ful demurly, lowe and nat a-lofte, To Mercurye with sobre wordis softe, Devoide boþe of doubilnes &amp; slouthe, Liche hir behest holde wil hir trouth. And sodeynly, with-out[e] more Iniurye, Þei disapered, and þe god Mercurie Stre?t to heuene þe ri?t[e] weye toke; And I anon out of my slepe awoke. Wher-of, my lord, whom I most loue &amp; drede, ?if ?e aduerte and wysly taken hede, Þat þis behest, affermyd in certeyn, Was vn-to me assured nat in veyn Of goodly Venus, liche as I haue tolde. Wherfore, I rede ?e ben of hert[e] bolde, Me for to sende with strong &amp; my?ty hond, With-oute abood, in-to Grekis lond, After þe forme þat I haue ?ow seyde. And, I hope, ?e schal be wel apayde, Whan I haue sped, as Venus haþ be-hi?t, And hom retourned with my lady bri?t: So schal ?e best, me list nat speke in veyn, Beschaunge of hir ?our suster wynne ageyn, Whom Thelamoun with-holden haþ so ?ore. Lo, þis is al; I can seye ?ou no more Towching theffect hooly of myn avis.” And after þat, stille sat Parys, As he þat haþ fully hym silf aquyt. But seye, Priam, allas! where was þi witte, Of necligence for to take kepe, Þi trust to sette on dremys or on slepe! Ful þinne was þi discrecioun, To take a grounde of fals illusioun, For to procede liche þi fantasye Vp-on a sweuene meynt with flaterye! Allas! resoun was no þing þi guyde! For Pallas was wrongly sette a-syde, Nat receyued with dew reuerence; And Iuno eke, with al hir sapience, For al hir good &amp; lokyng debonayre, With hir tresour &amp; hir hestis faire, Refusid was, allas, of wilfulnes. And sche þat is of loue þe goddes, And eke also of Wlcanus þe wyf, In whos seruise is euere werre and strif, Preferrid was þe appil to possede, Ageyn [al] ri?t, for Paris toke noon hede Saue vn-to lust, &amp; sette a-syde trouþe. Wher-þoru?, allas,—&amp; þat was ful gret routhe— Þe my?ty, riche, And þe noble toun Of Troye was brou?t to confusioun: Only for he kny?thod hath forsake, Prudence and gold, &amp; in his choyse y-take Only a womman, and holden hym þer-to, Þat after was rote of al her wo, As þis story ceryously schal telle. But I in dremys wil no lenger dwelle, But write furth how þat Dephebus, Þe þridde sonne of kyng Priamus, His tale gan in opyn audience, And to þe kyng, schortly in sentence, As he þat list a trouþe nat to spare, Euene þus his conceyt to declare: “My lord,” quod he, “?if þat euery wi?t Aduerten schuld &amp; castyn in his si?t Of future þing þe pereil &amp; þe doute, And cerchyn it with-Innen &amp; with-oute, From poynt to poynt, alwey in his resoun To cast[e] doutes &amp; turnen vp-so-doun, Þanne no wy?t schulde to no purpos wende In any mater for to make an ende, Or dar presvme by manhod in his þou?t. Who cast perilles acheveþ litel or nou?t: For ?if þe plowman alwey cast a-forne, How many graynes in his feld of corne Schal be devourid of foulis rauynous, Þat he doth sowe in feldys plenteuous, Þanne schulde he neuer, in vale nor in pleyn, For cowardyse þrowe abrod his greyne. Lat al swyche drede now be leyde a-syde; I holde foly lengere to abyde, But þat Parys, my brother, make him strong, With his schippis for to venge our wrong Vp-on Grekis, with al his peyne &amp; my?t, To preue schortly þat he is a kny?t. For of resoun ?e consydere may, How þat no man iustly may sey[e] nay, But þat Paris hath counsailled wele; For be my trouþe, as fer as I can fele, It wer errour his purpos to contrarie. Wherfor, lat hym now no lenger tarie, But holde his wey with a strong navie, For to avenge þe grete villenye, Þat Grekis han, ?if ?e taken hede, Don her-to-forn to vs and oure kynred; And, for fynal execucioun Of þe recure touchyng Exyoun, Whom þei trete in dishonest wyse, Ageyn al ri?t and title of iustice, Þat to þink, it ?ewith myn hert a wounde, Þe schame of whiche so new[e] doth rebounde Vp-on alle þat ben of hir allye. Wherfor, þe best þat I can espie, Is þat Parys take þis viage, With swiche as ben of fresche &amp; lusti age, Many to wende in-to Grekes lond; And by force of her my?ti honde, Maugre þe Grekis, proude &amp; most ellat, Ravische þer som lady of estat; And þanne ?e may, be kny?thod of my broþer, ?if ?e list, chaunge hir for þe toþer. Þis most redy &amp; schort conclusioun Þat I can sen for restitucioun Of Exyoun, ?if [þat] Parys wende; And of my conseil schortly þis þe ende.” And þanne as fast, ful discrete &amp; sage, Elenus, þe ferþe sone of age, Ros from his cete with gret reuerence, Praying his fader graunte hym audience, Þat he may seyn in presens of hem alle, Openly what þat schal be-falle, As he þat most of secre þinges can. And soburly þus his tale he gan, With clene entent and trew affeccioun: Howe Elenus, þe fourte sone of Priame, tolde &amp; seid þat Troye shuld be subuerted, and Parys went into Grece. “My lord,” quod he, “with supportacioun Of ?our grace, wher-in is most my trust, Lat non offence ben vn-to ?our lust, Nor ?ou displese, þou? I sey my conceyt, Sith ?e knowe I mene no disceyt; For neuer ?et failed no sentence, But þat it fil in experience, Liche as I tolde, in party and in al, In pryue trete &amp; in general, With-out menyng of any doubilnes, Þat it folwede as I dide expresse; Remembre ?ou, and ?e schal fynd it trewe. And ?if God wil, I schal not now of newe Spare for to seyn, liche as I conceyue, Nor, to be ded, with fraude ?ou deceyue, Declaryng first of trewe entencioun, As it schal folwe in conclusion, Þat ?if Paris in-to Grece wende, Trusteþ me wel, it wil vs alle schende. Þe goddis han, by reuelacioun, Made vn-to me demonstracioun; And eke I knowe it by astronomye; For neuer ?et in my prophesye Nas I deceyued of þat schuld[e] falle, Nor noon þat list me to counseil calle, So am I tau?t of þing þat schal be-tyde. Wherfor, I praye, for rancour nor for pride, Nor for envie of [noon] old hatered, To take vengaunce þat ?e nat procede In ?our avis, liche as ?e purpose; I seye ?ou pleynly, for me list nat glose, ?e schal repente ?if ?e Parys sende In-to Grece, þe whiche God defende! Wyteth þis wel, for þe conclusioun Schal fully turne to oure destruccioun, And fynally in-to oure ruyne, Liche as to ?ow I can a-forn devyne. For þis þe fyn þat þer folwe schal: Subuersioun, bothe of tour and wal, Of paleys, house, here in oure cite, Al goth to nou?t; ?e gete no more of me; For me semeth, it ou?te I-now suffyse, Þat I haue seid, sith þat ?e be wyse: For ?if þat ?e aduerte to my sawe, I doute not, þat ?e wil withdrawe ?oure hand be-tyme, or þat more damage Assaile ?ou by constreynt of þis rage. For bet it is be-tymes to abstene From þis purpos, whiche is ?et but grene, Þan of hede hastily assente To þing for whiche we schal echon repente; For plenerly þer schal no þing socoure, Þat þer schal folwe of ?ou &amp; alle ?oure Despitful deth, with-oute excepcioun, Of on and alle abydyng in þis toun. First on ?our silf, pleynly to endyte, Schal þe vengaunce of þe Grekis byte, Þoru? þe furie of her mortal tene; And ?oure wyfe, Eccuba þe quene, Schal lede hir lyf, þoru? Grekis cruelte, In sorwe &amp; wo and in captiuite; And ?oure leges by þe swerde schal pace Of cruel deth, with-outen any grace; And Innocentis mercyles schal blede, In ?our avis ?if þat ?e procede Of wilfulnes a werre for to make, And folily for to vndirtake For to perturbe ?our quiete and ?our reste, Whiche schal turne no þing for þe best, But to ruyne of ?ow &amp; of vs alle. I can no more; but or þat meschef falle, Mi conseil is a-forn for to prouyde, And wilfulnes for to sette a-syde; Specialy, whan deth, as I ?ow tolde, Mote be þe fyn, ?if ?e ?our purpos holde. Loo, here is al, with-oute wordis mo, In-to Grece ?if þat Parys goo!” And in þis wyse, whan þat Elenus Had pleinly seid, as Guydo telleth vs, Trist and hevy, with a pale face, Ageyn resorteth to his sittyng place, Of whos sentence astonyd euerychon Sat in silence, stille as any stoon, Powerles her hertis to reswme. To speke a word no man dar preswme Of alle þe pres, but kept her lippes clos, Til at þe laste, Troylus up a-ros, ?ong, fresche, and lusty, &amp; coraious also, And ay desyrous for to haue a-do In armys manly, as longeth to a kny?t. And when þat he, of chere ful glad &amp; li?t, Sawe his fader and breþeren euerychon So inly trowblid, þus he spak anon: “O noble &amp; worþi, sittyng enviroun, Of hi?e prudence &amp; gret discrecioun, Manful also, and of hi?e corage, What sodeyn fere haþ brou?t ?ou in þis rage? What new[e] trouble is cropen in ?our brest, For þe sentence of a cowarde prest?— Sith þei echon, as ?e schal euer fynde, Desyre more, verrayly, of kynde, To lyue in lust &amp; voide awey traueyle, And dedly hate to heren of bataille; For þei her wit fynally applye To swe her lust &amp; lyue in glotonye, To fille her stomak &amp; restore her mawe, To rest &amp; ese euer for to drawe, And to swe her inward appetite, Þis her Ioye and þis is her delyte, In etyng, drinkyng, and in couetyse Is her studie, and fully to deuyse How þei may folwe her lust, with-out[e] more, Of ri?t nou?t ellis sette þei no store. Allas, for schame! whi be ?e so dismaied, And sitte mwet, astonyed &amp; affrayed For þe wordis of þis Elenus, Ferful for drede as a litel mows, Þat he quaketh to here speke of fi?t; And, more-our, ageyn al skil &amp; ri?t, In preiudise of þe goddis alle, He takeþ on hym to seyn what schal be-falle, Of þing futur for to specyfie, As he had a spirit of profecye Grauntid to hym allone in special, As þau?e he were in konyng perigal To þe goddis, hauyng prescience To schew a-forn, þoru? his sapience, What schal be-tide, ouþer euel or good. Lat be, lat be! for no wi?t is so wood, Þat haþ his witte, to ?eue þer-to credence, Þat any man by crafte or by science, Þat mortal is, haþ konyng to devine Fortunys cours, or fatys to termyne. Swyche causis hid, conselid in secre, Reserued ben to goddis priuete; Men may devine, but al is but folye To taken hede; for þei don but lye. Wherfor, I rede, as in þis mater, Boþe on and alle, &amp; ?ou my lord so dere, Texclude al drede &amp; al þat may disturbe Out of ?our hert, and lat no þing perturbe ?our hi?e corages, þat Elenus haþ tolde; And ?if þat he of hert[e] be nat bolde, As manhod wold, to help[e] venge our wronge, Lat hym go hyde hym in þe temple strong, And kepe hym clos in contemplacioun, To wake and praye by deuocioun With-oute socour, a-dayes and a-ny?tes, And suffreþ swiche as be lusty kny?tes To hante her ?ouþe &amp; grene lustynes, Manly in armys to preue her hardynes, Þat þei may haue þe better acquaintaunce In tyme comyng, for to do vengance On her enmyes and her cruel foon. And commaundeth þat Parys may forþe gon To execute þe fyn of ?our entent, Aforn purposed in ?our parlament, Vp-on Grekis for her offencioun, To parforme vp þe peyne of talioun For wrongis old, of whiche ?it þe fame Rehersid is vn-to our alder schame Þoru?-oute þe world, ?e wot þis is no les.” And þer-with-al Troylus held his pes. And sodeynly alle þat were present Be-gan attonys, al be on assent, Troilus counseil gretly for to preyse, And his manhod to þe heuene areyse, His fresche corage and his hi?e prowes, His feruent ?el and his hardines, And of on hert gretly hym comende; And ri?t anoon þer þei made an ende. Þan Priamus, whan þat al was don, Vp-on þe tyme of þe hour of noon, To mete goth with-Inne Illyoun, Alle his sonys sittyng enviroun. And after mete he called haþ Parys And Dephebus also, þat was ful wyse, And secrely bad þei schuld[e] go Þe same day with oþer lordis mo To Panonye, in al þe hast þei may, To make hem redy, a?ens a certeyn day, With al þe array of worþi chyualry Þat þei may gete in her company, Toward[es] Grece to seylen hastyly. And after þat, þe kyng al sodeynly Þe next[e] day made his counseil calle; And euene þus he seyde a-forn hem alle: “O noble liges, beyng now present, My purpos is to sey ?ow myn entent, With-oute abood, to here it ?ef ?e list. As I suppose, to ?ow is nat vn-wist How þe Grekis, of pride and tyrannye, Of malis old compasid by envie, In many wyse han ageyn vs wrou?t, Whiche is so grene þat I for-?ete nou?t. For day by day, encresyng euer mo By remembraunce, renewed is my wo, Whan I record &amp; cast[e] vp and doun Oure greuys alle, &amp; how þat Exyoun In seruitute among hem doth soiourne. Whiche oft a day causeth me to mourne, And myn hert almost asondre ryue, For to considre &amp; seen it be my lyue; Whos cruelte we han to dere abou?t, Nat-with-stondyng þat I haue menys sou?t To ben in rest, with-outen any more, Whan in-to Grece I sent Anthenor, Peysibly my suster to recure, And þe surplus paciently tendure. But al for nou?t; þei toke of it non hede, For al þat I offered of goodlyhede; It was nat herd, for lak of gentilnes, Record of whiche doubleth my distres. Wherfor, we most, as techeth sorgerye, With scharp yrens sechyn remedye, To kut awey, by þe rote rounde, Þe prowde flesche þat growith in þe grounde, Whiche wil not voide with oynementis softe, Al-be þat þei be leid þer-to ful ofte. Ri?t so be ensample, we most be duresse Getyn recur, whan þat with fairnesse We may noon haue: wherfor, be ?our avys, My purpos is to send[e] forþe Parys In-to Grece, som lady þer to wynne, And bring hir hom; &amp; we schal her with-Inne Kepe hir strong, maugre who seyth nay, Til we sen som agreable day, Þat þei be fayn, liche myn oppinioun, To haue exchaunge for hir of Exyoun, My dere suster, whom I loue so. We may nat faile þat it schal be do, So þe goddis be to vs fauourable, And þis counseil be also acceptable To ?ou echon, as it is to me; For whan a þing toucheþ a commvnte— Of wyse men as it is affermed— Of alle þe comoun it ou?te be confermed; Þing touchyng al schuld[e] ben aprevid Of alle echon, or it wer a-cheuyd: Wherfor, I cast, be avis of ?ou echon, Pleinly to werke.” &amp; with þat word anoon Þis noble Priam was sodeynly in pes. And after þat, among[es] al þe pres, Whan al was hust, in her alder si?t, A kny?t vp ros, and Pentheus he hi?t, Þat son[e] was of Euforbius— De transformatis, as seith Ovidius— In-to whom he feyneth þat þer was Whilom þe sowle of Pyctagoras Holy transmewed, so as writ Ovide: As touchyng þat, I wil no lenger byde, But telle forþe of þis Pentheus, A-fore þe kyng whiche gan his tale þus: “My lige lord, vn-to ?our hi?e noblesse Displese it nat, nor to ?our worþines, In presence of ?our maieste Þat I schal seyn, for taquite me Towardis ?ow of my feith &amp; trouþe; For sothfastly in me may be no slouþe Touchyng ?oure honour, þat with-oute drede, With ?el of feith I brenne as doth þe glede, Of alle harmys to bidden ?ow be war. For dout[e]les afferme wel I dar, ?if ?e stond in ?our first avis, As ?e purpos, to sende forþe Parys, I dout[e] nat þat it schal ?ou rewe; For God wel wot, of old &amp; nat of newe, I had a fader callid Euforbius, Discret &amp; wis, and ri?t vertuous, And knowyng had a-forn of euery þing By prescience and by for-wetyng, To telle pleinly þoru? his philosophie, So clere he saw with his hertis eye, Þat þer ne was no þing so secre Hid from his knowyng, nor no preuite Þat he hit knewe; he was of witte so sage. And at þe last, wan he was of age An hundrid ?ere, with lokkis grey &amp; hore, I can remembre how he compleyned sore And wepe also of pite tenderly, Fully affermyng, ?if Paris outterly Went in-to Grece to ravische hym a wyf, Þer schuld[e] folwe swiche a mortal stryf Vp-on vs alle, þat sothly þis cite Schuld in-to asches &amp; cyndres turned be; And þat þer schuld no þing vs socour; Þat Grekis swerd schal cruelly deuour Boþe hi?e &amp; lowe, &amp; pleynly spare noon. Wherfor, I praye, among ?ou euerychon, Of þat I telle haueþ no dispit; ?our wrong to venge putteth in respit; And rancour old, I rede þat ?e lete; And þe tranquille now of ?our quiete, Of hastynes, þat ?e [nat] submitte To Fortune þat can so falsly flitte; Perturbeth nat, for non olde enmyte, With new[e] steryng ?oure felicite: For ?if þat ?e to þis iourne assent, ?e euerychon ful sore schal repente; And ?if ?e wiln algatis þedir sende, In Paris stede lat som oþer wende, List his viage be to ?ou no spede; Þis my counceil, &amp; þis is [ful] my rede, Seide vnder support only of ?our grace.” And sodeinly þei gan echon to chace At Pentheus, &amp; lowde ageyn hym crie, Reprevyng hym and þe prophesye Of his fader to her confusioun. But, o allas! þe reuolucioun Of Ioye or wo, [or] of felicite! For þing ordeyned nedes moste be; Þe ordre of þinges with fate is so englued, For þat schal falle may nat be eschewed; Whiche caused hem for to assent in on, Vndiscretly, þat Parys schulde gon— Vnhappyly with hap þei were envoluyd; And þus concludyng, her counseil is dissoluyd. But casuely, it by-fil ri?t þan, Þat þis avis vn-to þe eris ran Of Cassandra, and sche with gret affray Of sodeyn wo gan crye “weyllaway:” “Allas!” quod sche, “allas! what wil ?e don? What! schal Parys now in-to Grece gon?” And with þat word, sche barst oute to wepe Ful pitously with inward sy?es depe; Sche gan to waile &amp; swone for þe peyne, And furiously with noyse to compleyne; With woful rage &amp; many pitous sown Sche made a mortal lamentacioun: For to be ded, sche my?t hir nat with-holde; With here to-torn, and with fistes folde, Sche seyde “allas” more þan an hundrid sythe— “O stormy Fortune, why listow to kythe Þi cruel force to oure aduersite, Vp-on vs alle &amp; vp-on þis cite, Of mortal Ire and gery violence, With swerde of vengaunce wers þan pestilence? O Troye, Troye, what is þi gilt, allas! What hastow don, what is þi trespas, To ben euersed &amp; turned in-to nou?t With wilde fyre? þi synne is dere [a]bou?t! A! Priam kyng! vncely is þi chance!

What maner cryme or importable offence Hastow wrou?t to han swiche recompense Þe day to abyde, o noble, worþi quene, Of þi sonys swiche vengaunce for to sen! O woful deth, cruel and horrible! Allas! whi ar ?e now no more credible To my conseil swiche harmys to eschewe, ?our mortal purpos fully to remewe, Þat he go nat, as it is ordeyned; For þou?t of whiche I am so constreyned, Þat vnneþe I may þe wo endure!” And to hir fader þis woful creature Halt strey?t hir way, &amp; falliþ plat to grounde, And of hir wepyng al in water wounde— By hir chekis so þe teris reyne— And as sche my?t, for constreint of hir peyne, Vp-on hym sche gan to clepe &amp; crye, Besechyng hym to schape remedye, With pitous vois, as sche þat knew ful wel In þis mater pleynly euerydel, What schal [be-]falle, &amp; had it ful in mynde, Þe sodeyn harmys þat swe schal be-hynde. But al hir clamour was [nat] but in veyn; For þat schal falle, as somme clerkis seyn, Ne may nat wel of men eschewed be; And eke Fortune, by gret aduersite, Of hasty Ire furious and wood, And vnkynde to þe Troyan blood, Causeles ageyn[e]s hem a-grevid, And of rancour sodeynly amevid With blynde a-waites to cache hem in a traunce, Be violence of hir vnhappy chaunce, Hath with a swy?e turned hir whele vnstable, As sche þat is envious and mutable, To haste Troyans to her confusioun, Of wilfulnes and vndiscresioun Ageyns Grekis a quarel for to make. And þer-vppon han her conseil take, And acheuyd, as ?e han herd deuyse, With-oute assent of þe most[e] wyse. For ?if þei had þe dissuasioun Of Hector herde, concluded in resoun, In þis mater, and of Elenus The counseil take, and to Pentheus Aduertid wysely, and to his sentence With-oute feynyng ?oue ful credence, And of Cassandra, þat neuer koude lye, Prudently herde þe prophesye, Fro point to point for to cast a-forn, In swiche meschef þei had nat be lorn, But floured ?it in her felicite, With-oute damage and aduersite. But Fortune wil haue hir cours alwey, Whos purpos holt, who seyth ?e or nay; For sche it was þat made þis viage, With forhed pleyn and [a] false visage, With sugre out-schad, and venym in þe rote, Bitter of tast, and in schewyng soote, Wrinkled double, like an hornyd snail, Feyth in hir face &amp; fraude ay in þe tail, To hast Troyans acorden in-to oon, Þat Paris schuld in-to Grece goon, As ?e han herde: þer is no more to seyn; For her-vppon þei cast hem &amp; ordeyn. Howe Parys toke þe See with a grete navye towarde þe londe of Grece; and howe of chance he met with Kenge Menelay, Heleyns husbonde, not knowynge what he was. The tyme aprocheþ whan þe sonne schene His golden wayn whirlid vp a-twene Þe clere sterris of Iades so red, Whiche han her si?t in þe Crabbis hed, And Pliades, þe seuene sterris bri?t, Of whiche sixe apperen to oure si?t; For þe seuenþe drawith hir asyde, And couertly doth hir bemys hide, Whilom for sche dide a gret offence, Þat vn-to vs causeth hir absence. For sche dar nat schewe hir stremys clere, Nor with hir sustren openly apere, Whilom for sche with a god mortal Dide a synne þat was crimynal, Whiche noised was &amp; kouþe þoru? þe heuene, Þat sche allone among þe susters seuene Schroudeth to vs schamfastly hir chere. And whan Tytan in þe ?odyak spere Atwen þis sterris had[de] take his se, Of þe Bole in þe sixtene degre, Vp-on þe tyme of Ioly grene May, Whan þat Flora with hir hewes gay Hath euery playn, medwe, hil, &amp; vale With hir flouris, quik and no þing pale, Over-sprad &amp; cladde in lyuere newe, And braunchis blosme with many lusty hewe, And bit vs fully to be glad &amp; li?— For by assuraunce þei haue her frute be-hi?t Ageyn autumpne, who so list hem shake, Whan on vynes ripeth euery grape— And þus þis sesoun, most lusty of disport, Enbrasiþ hertis with new recounfort, Only of hope by kynde as it is dew, Þat holsom frute schal þe blosmys swe, Whan tyme cometh by reuolucioun. And þus in May, þe lusty fresche sesoun, Whan briddes syngen in her armonye, The same tyme out of Panonye Repeyred ben Dephebus and Paris, And with hem brou?t, chosen by devis, Þre þousand kny?tes redy for to goon With hem to Grece, &amp; schippis many on, Ful vitailled of al þat may hem nede. And of þese schippis þe noumbre, as I rede, Was two &amp; twenty, liche as writ Guydo. And after þis, with-oute more a-do, Þe kyng commaundeth vn-to Eneas, To Anthenor and to Polydamas, In al hast þat þei hem redy make With Parys kny?tly for to vndirtake, As ?e han herde, þis Iourne for tacheue. And on þe tyme whan þei toke her leue, Priamus, with schort conclusioun, Scheweþ þeffect of his entencioun, And specialy þat þei her dever don For to recure his suster Exioun, As ?e han herd her-to-fore me telle: What schulde I more in þis mater dwelle? Whan þei wer redy, with-oute more soiour, Þis Parys first, as lord and gouernour Of þis viage made by Priamus, And his broþer, callid Dephebus, Her leue toke with wepyng tenderly; And after þat to schippe manfully, With-oute abode þei be-gan hem dresse, And in þe name of Venus, þe goddes, And my?ty Iove, þei token her Iourne. Þei hale vp ankir, and by þe large se Þei gan to seile, and haue þe wynde at wille, Þe water calme, blaundischyng, and stille, With-oute trouble of any boystous wawe. And to þe costis þei gan fast[e] draw Of Grekis lond, for no þing hem lette; And of fortune in her cours þei mette A Grekysche schip, myn auctor telleþ vs, In whiche þer was þe kyng Menelaus, Toward Pyram, a famus strong cite, For to visite a duke of hi?e degre Þat Nestor hi?t; and þis Menelaus Was broþer eke vn-to þe kyng famus, Þe wyse, worþi, grete Agamenoun, Most of name and reputacioun Amongis Grekis for his worþines. And Menelay, þis story beriþ witnes, Husbond was to þe quene Eleyne, Þat was suster to þe breþer tweyne, Castor &amp; Pollux, whiche, as I ?ou tolde, Wer of her hond so worþi kny?tes holde. And in þat tyme, liche to her degre, In Strynestar, her most chef cite, Þei held an housholde solempne &amp; ryal. Þe loue of whom was so special, Of wille &amp; hert acordyng with þe dede, Atwixe hem two, of verray breþerhede, Þat noon from other koude lyue alone. With [w]hom was eke þe maiden Hermyone, Þe ?ong[e] dou?ter of þe quene Eleyne, Of fairnes most inly souereyne, Most passyngly excellyng in bewte. And þus Troyans, sailyng by þe se Toward Grece, among þe wawis wete, Of auenture happed[e] to mete Kyng Menelay, seilyng by her syde; And non of [hem] list, of verray pride, For to enquere what þat oþer was, But passe furþe a ful huge pas, For non of hem oþer koude knowe. And ey þe wynde pesybly gan blowe, Þe Troyan flete causyng in a while For taproche to the noble Ile Þat callid is Cithera þis day; And in þe hauene, in al hast þei may, Þei cast hanker, &amp; bond her schippis strong; And after þat, hem list nat tarye long To take þe lond, ful many lusty man, Arraying hem as freschely as þei can. Now, in þis Ile of passyng excellence, Þer was a temple of gret reuerence, Þat bilded was of olde fundacioun, And most honoured in þat regioun, Þoru?-oute þe lond, boþe fer &amp; ner— The fest[e] day, ay from ?er to ?er, Liche as it fil by reuolucioun, Repeyryng þeder of gret deuocioun, In honour only of Venus, þe goddes, Whom þe Grekis with al her besynes Honoured most of euery maner age, With ?iftes bringyng and with pilgrimage, With gret offeryng and with sacrifyse, And vsid was in her paynym wyse. For in þis phane, as þei knele &amp; wake With contrit hert, &amp; her prayer make, Þe statue ?af of euery questyoun Pleyn answer and ful solucioun, With cerymonyes to Venus as þei loute; Of euery þing þat þei hadde doute, Þei hadde ful declaracioun. And þus þe Grekis vp-on Cytheroun Halwyn þis fest with riche &amp; gret array, With rytis due, as ferforþe as þei may, In hope fully þe better for to þrive. And of fortune, whan he dide aryue Vp-on þe lond, by auenture or cas, Þe same tyme þis fest[e] halwed was Of many Greke, commyng to and fro From euery cost, þat to þe temple go On pilgrimage her vowes to acquyte, Of þe place þe reliques to vesyte. Howe Parys enterde þe Ille of Citherea, wher he met with the fayre Quene Heleyne. And whan Paris dide þis espie, He gadred out of his companye Þe worþiest þat he chesen may; And to þe temple he took þe ri?t[e] waye, Ful wel be-seyn, &amp; in kny?tly wyse, And dide his honour &amp; his sacrifyse Ful humblely to þe Grekis liche, With many nowche &amp; many Iouwel riche, With gold &amp; siluer, stonys and perre He spendeþ þer, liche to his degre, And quit hym manly in his oblacioun[s]; And deuoutly in his orisouns He hym demeneþ, þat Ioy[e] was to se. Now was Parys of passyng gret bewte Among[es] alle þat euer werne alyve: For þer was non þat my?t with hym striue, Troyan nor Greke, to speke of semlyhede, Wonder fresche and lusty, as I rede, And in his port ful lik a gentil kny?t. Of whos persone for to han a si?t, Þei gan to prese, boþe ny?e and fere, So ryally he had hym in his gere, And coueyte, of hi?e estat and lowe, What he was, gretly for to knowe; And of his men þei aske besely, Fro when he cam, &amp; þe cause why, Of his comyng enqueryng on by on. But prudently þei kepte hem euerychon, Þat no þing was openly espyed In her answere, so þei han hem guyed, Þat euery þing kepid was secre, Eueryche of hem was so avisee; Al-be þat somme oppenly declare What þat he was, &amp; ne list not spare, But tolde pleynly þe cause of his commyng, And how Priam, þe strong[e] my?ty kyng, His fader was, most royal of renoun, And how he cam also for Exyoun. Þus eche of hem gan with other rowne, At pryme face, whan he cam to towne, And þer-vp-on wer ymagynatyf, Sore mvsyng and inquisytif, Eche with other be suspecioun Demyng þer-of liche her oppinioun, And raþest þei þat no þing ne knewe, As folkis don of þinges þat be newe. And whiles þei of þis mater trete In sondry wyse amonge her wordes grete, Þe fame of hem gan anoon atteyne To þe eris of þe quene Eleyne, Ni?e besyde in þat regioun. And whan sche herd be relacioun, And by report of hem þat cam by-twene, Þis faire Eleyne, þis fresche, lusty quene, Anon as sche þe soþe vndirstood, With-oute tarying or any more abood, Sche hasteþ hir to þis solempnite, Þe fresche folke of Frigye for to se— Wel mor, God wot, in hir entencioun To se Parys, þan for deuocioun. Vnder colour of holy pilgrymage, To þe temple sche takeþ hir viage, With gret meyne &amp; ryal apparaille, Parys to sen for sche wil nat faille. But, o allas! what lusty new[e] fyre Haþ hir hert enflawmyd be desyre, To go to vigiles ouþer to spectaclis! Noon holynes to heryn of myraclis Hath mevid hir, þat þer schal be-falle; But as þe maner is of women alle To drawe þedir, platly to conclude, Where as þei be sure þat multitude Gadrid is, at liberte to se, Wher þei may finde opportunyte To her desyre, ful narwe þei awaite, Now couertly her eyne for to baite In place wher as set is her plesaunce, Now priuely to haue her daliaunce Be som sygne or castyng of an eye, Or toknes schewyng in hert[e] what þei drye, With touche of hondis [stole] among þe pres, With arm or foot to cache vp in her les Whom þat hem list, al-be he fre or bonde, Of nature þei can hym holde on honde— Ageyn whos slei?t availeþ wit nor my?t: For what hem list, be it wrong or ri?t, Þei ay acheue, who seyth ?e or nay, Ageyn whos lust diffende him no man may. Þus Guydo ay, of cursid fals delit, To speke hem harme haþ kau?t an appetit, Þoru?-oute his boke of wommen to seyn ille, Þat to translate it is ageyn my wille. He haþ ay Ioye her honour to transuerse; I am sory þat I mote reherse Þe felle wordis in his boke y-founde. To alle women I am so moche bounde: Þei ben echon so goodly and so kynde, I dar of hem nat sey[e]n þat I fynde Of Guydo write þoru?-out Troye book; For whan I radde it, for fer myn hert[e] quoke, And verrailly my wittis gonne faille, Whan I þer-of made rehersaille. Liche his decert lat Guydo now be quit; For ?e schal here anon how þat he chit Þe quene Eleyne, for cause þat sche went With deuoute hert hir offring to present, To þe temple of Venus, þe goddes; Þus, word by word, he seiþ to hir Expres: Howe Quene Heleyne, aftire that she herd of Parys, hasted here to þe Temple. O mortal harme, þat most is for to drede! A, fraude y-cast be slei?t of wommanhede, Of euery wo, gynnyng, crop, and rote! Ageyn[e]s whiche helpe may no bote. Whan lust haþ dryue in her hert a nail, Ay dedly venym sueth at þe tail, Whiche no man haþ power to restreyne; Recorde I take of þe quene Eleyne, Þat hoot[e] brent, allas! in hir desires, Of newe lust to dele with straungeris Whom sche knewe nat, ne neuer saw a-forn, Wher-þoru?, allas, ful many man was lorn, Of cruel deth embracid in þe cheyne With-oute pite! now, sey, þou quene Eleyne, What gost or spirit, allas, haþ mevid þe, Sool fro þi lord in swiche ryalte Oute of þin house to gon among þe pres? Whi were þou wery to liue at home in pes, And wentist out straungeris for to se, Takyng noon hed [vn-]to þin honeste? Þou schust a kepte þi closet secrely, And not haue passed out so folily In þe abscence of þi lorde, allas! Þou wer to wilful &amp; rakil in þis cas To sen aforn what schuld after swe; For al to sone þou wer drawe out of mwe, Þat koudist nat kepe at home þi boundis. Þou wentist out as hare among [þe] houndis, For to be cau?t, of verray wilfulnes, And þi desyre koudist not compesse; For þou þi lust list nat to refreyne. O many woman haþ kau?t in a treyne Her goyng oute swiche halwes for to seke; It sit hem bet hem siluen for to kepe Clos in her chaumbre, and fleen occasioun: For neuer schip schulde in pereil drown, Nor skatre on rok, nor be with tempest rent, Nor with Karibdis deuourid nor y-schent, Nor gon to wrak with no wedris ille, ?if it wer kepte in þe hauene stille. For who wil not occasiouns eschewe, Nor drediþ not pereil for to swe, He most among, of necessite, Or he be war, endure aduersite; And who can nat hir fot fro trappis spare, Lat hir be war or sche falle in þe snare: For harme y-don to late is to compleine. For ?if whilom þe worþi quene Eleyne Hir siluen had kepte at home in clos, Of hir þer nadde ben so wikke a loos Reported ?it, grene, fresche, and newe; Whos chaunce vnhappi eche man ou?t[e] rewe, Þat cause was of swiche destruccioun Of many worþi, and confusioun Of hir husbonde &amp; many other mo On Grekis syde, and [on] Troye also, In þis story as ?e schal after rede. And so þis quene, as fast as sche may spede, To þe temple hath þe wey[e] nome Ful rially; and whan þat sche was come Ful deuoutly with-Inne Cytheroun, Made vn-to Venus hir oblacioun In presence and si?t of many on, With many Iowel and many riche stoon. And whan Parys had[de] þis espied, To þe temple anon he haþ hym hyed, Ful þriftely in al þe hast he my?t; And whan þat he had[de] first a si?t Of þe goodly, faire, fresche quene, Cupidis dart, þat is whet so kene, Or he was war, haþe hym markid so, Þat for a-stonyed he nist[e] what to do, So he merveileþ hir gret semlynes, Hir womanhed, hir port, &amp; hir fairnes: For neuer a-forne [ne] wende he þat Nature Koude haue made so faire a creature; So aungillyk sche was of hir bewte, So femynyn, so goodly on to se, Þat he dempte, as by liklynes, For hir bewte to be som goddes. For his hert dide hym ay assure Þat sche was no mortal creature— So heuenly faire and so celestial He þou?t sche was in party &amp; in al. And considereth ful a-visely Hir feturis in ordre by and by Ententifly with-Inne in his resoun, Euery þing by good inspeccioun: Hir golden her, lik þe schene stremys Of fresche Phebus with his bri?t[e] bemys, Þe goodlyhed of hir fresche face, So repleuished of bewte &amp; of grace, Euene ennwed with quiknes of colour Of þe rose and þe lyllie flour, So egaly, þat nouþer was to wyte Þoru? noon excesse of moche nor to lite. With-Inne þe cerclyng of hir eyen bry?t Was paradys compassid in hir si?t, Þat þoru? a brest þe bewte wolde perce. And certeynly, ?if I schal reherse Hir schap, hir forme, and feturis by &amp; by, As Guydo doth by ordre ceryously, From hed to foot, clerly to devise, I han non englysche þat þer-to may suffyse; It wil nat be, oure tonge is not lyke. I want[e] flouris also of rethorik, To sue his florischyng or his gey peynture, For to discriue so fayre a creature; For my colours ben to feble and feynt, Þat nouþer can ennwe wel nor peint; Eke I am nat a-queintid with no mwse Of alle nyne: þer-fore I me excuse To ?ou echon, nat al of necligence, But for defaut only of eloquence, And ?ou remitte to Guydo for to se How he discriveth bi ordre hir bewte; To take on me it were presumpcioun. But I wil telle how Parys vp &amp; doun Goth in þe temple, and his eye cast Toward Eleyne, &amp; gan presen fast, As he þat brent hote in Louys fyre, Þat was enflawmed gretly be desyre. And oft he chaungeþ countenaunce &amp; chere, And euer he neieth to hir ner and nere, I-darted þoru? with hir eyen tweyne. And ageynward þe fresche quene Eleyne As hote brent in herte pryuely, Al-be no man it outward koude espie; For sche þou?t sche had neuer aforn, Of alle men þat euer ?et wer born Sey non so fair, nor like to hir plesaunce; On hym to loke was hir sufficiaunce. For in the temple sche toke hede of ri?t nou?t, But to compasse &amp; castyn in hir þou?t How sche may cachen opportunyte With hym to speke at good liberte: Þis holly was al hir besynes. For hym sche felt so inly gret distres, Þat ofte sche chaungeþ countenaunce &amp; hewe. And Venus haþ marked hem of newe With hir brondes fired by feruence, And inflawmed be sodeyn influence, Þat egaly þei wer brou?t in a rage. And saue þe eye atwen was no message: Eche on oþer so fixe haþ cast his si?t, Þat þei conseiue &amp; wist[en] a-non ri?t With-Inne hem silfe wat her hert[e] ment. And nere to hir euer Parys went To seke fully and gete occasioun, Þat þei my?t, by ful relacioun, Her hertis conceit declare secrely. And so bi-fel, þat Paris nei?eþ ny?e To þe place wher þe quene Eleyne Stood in her se; &amp; þer atwen hem tweyne, Þei broken out þe somme of al her hert, And ?af Issu to her inward smerte. But þis was don, list þei werne espied, Whan þe peple was most occupied In þe temple for to stare &amp; gase, Now her, now þer, as it wer a mase. Þei kepte hem clos, þat no worde a-sterte; Þer was no man þe tresoun my?t aduerte Of hem tweyn, ne what þei wolde mene; But at þe last, Paris and þis quene Concluded han, with schort avisement, Fully þe fyn of her boþe entent, And sette a purpos atwix hem in certeyn, Whan þei cast for to mete ageyn. But list men had to hem suspecioun, Þei made an ende, with-oute more sermoun, And depart, al-be þat þei wer loþe. And sobirly a-noon þis Paris goth Out of þe temple, his hert in euery part Wounded þoru?-out with Louys fyry dart; To his schippis he halt þe ri?t[e] way. And þan anoon, in al þe hast he may, Whan assemblid was his chiualrie, On and oþer of his companye, In few[e] wordis, as schortly as he can, To-forn hem alle his tale þus he gan. Howe Parys exortede his pepele for þe spoylynge of þe Tempyle of Venus within þe seid Ille of Citherea, fro whenes he karede to Troye al the Iewellys that he founde þerin. “Sirs,” quod he, “schortly to expresse, Þe cause is kouþe to ?our worþines, Whi my fader in-to Grece vs sent; For, as ?e knowe, þe chef of his entent Was to recuren his suster Exyoun Out of þe hondis of kyng Thelamoun. Þe whiche þing, for ou?t I can espie, Is impossible sothly in myn eye, Be any weye, as fer as I can se, He is so gret &amp; strong in þis contre Of his alyes about on euery syde, And in hert so inly ful of pride, To ?eld hir vp he haþ nat but disdeyn, Þer-of to trete it wer [nat] but in veyn. Wherfore, þe best þat I can devise, Sith our power may nat now suffise To werreye hym in þis regioun— We be nat egal of my?t nor of renoun, For lak of men with hym to holde a felde; We may not semble with spere nor with schelde Tencountren hym with al his multitude— Wherfor, þe best þat I can conclude, Is, sithe Fortune haþ vs hider brou?t, And þe goddes han eke for vs wrou?t So graciously to make vs for to londe At Venus temple, fast[e] by þe stronde, Whiche haboundeþ with ful gret riches Of Grekis offeryng vnto þe goddes, Be lond &amp; se, fro many sondry port, Of men and women þat han her resort To þat place in worschip of Venus, So þat þe wif of kyng Menelaus Is þer present, ful riche &amp; wel be-seyn— And ?if þat we by manhod my?t atteyn To rauisch hir, and þe temple spoyle, And of her tresour chesen oute &amp; coyle Þe chef Iowellis, &amp; chargen our somers With gold &amp; siluer, and take prisoneris, And maugrey hem to our schippis bring Þis same ny?t with-oute tariyng, We may nat faille, who-euer þat sey nay, ?if ?e assent, of a riche pray. Wherfore, in hast þat ?e ?ou redy make, And euery man anon his harnes take, And arme hym wel in his best array.” And þei assent, with-oute more delay, And in hir schippis þei bid[e] til at ny?t, Whan Phebus chare withdrawen had his li?t Vnder wawes, &amp; sterris dide appere On þe heuene with her stremys clere, Or þe mone þat tyme dide rise, Þei schop hem forþe in ful þrifty wyse, The manly Troyans in steel armyd bri?t, To þe temple holdyng her wey[e] ri?t. For þei cast no longer for to tarie, But prowdely entre [in] þe seintuarie, In-to þe chapel callid Cytheroun, With-oute reuerence or deuocioun Don to Venus in hir oratorie; For it was clene oute of her memorie, Honour and drede &amp; alle obseruaunce: For fynally al her attendaunce, As myn auctor sothly can diffyne, Was to ri?t nou?t but only to ravyne. Þei token al þat cam to her honde, Riches &amp; tresour þat was in þe londe, Gold &amp; siluer, stonys and Iowellis, Reliques sacrid, þe holy eke vessels, With-out abood oute of þe sacrarie, And al y-fere to her schippis carye— It is a wonder, to þenken on þe good! Þei kille &amp; sle al þat hem withstood— It was a pite for to seen hem blede. And many Greke þei to schip[pe] lede, Þat after liveden in captiuite Ful many ?er in Troye þe cite. And þer-whyles goth Paris to Eleyne, And hir enbrasiþ in his armys tweyn, Ful humblely &amp; with gret reuerence, In whom he fonde no maner resistence; It sat hir nat, sche was so womanly, For to Paris sche ?alde hir outterly; Hir hert in hap was ?olde or sche cam þere, Þerfor to ?elde hir sche had lasse fere; Sche can nat stryue, nor no woman scholde. And he anon, as gentilnes[se] wolde, Counforteþ hir as he best can or may, And lad hir with hym, with-oute more delay, To his schippes; and þer ful bysely He sette wardis to kepe hir honestly, Whil he returneþ to þe temple ageyn To spoyle and robbe &amp; to make al pleyn Þoru? þe temple with his wallis wyde. Now stood a castel faste þer be-syde, I-stuffid wel with Grekysche sowdyours, Þe whiche a-woke with noise of þe pilours Þe same ny?t, &amp; gan make a schout; And þer-with-al anoon þei issen out, Armyd in stel, þe temple to reskewe, And manfully after hem þei sewe. And so be-fil whan þei to-gydre mette With speris scharp &amp; swerdis kene whet, Þei ran I-fere as tigres al vnmylde, Liche wode liouns or þis boris wylde; Þer was no feynyng founden in her fi?t, Al-be þe felde departed nas a-ri?t, For þe Troyans doubled hem in noumbre, Þat outterly þe Grekis þei encombre, And at meschef maden hem to fle, Purswe after and cruelly hem sle With-oute mercy to þe castel gate. Ther was [no] reskvs, for þei com[e] late, Of þis skarmysche, for þe fyn was deth; Now her, now þer, þei ?elden vp þe breth, So my?tely Troyans hem assaille, Þat to withstond it wold[e] not availle: For of manhod þei þe felde han wonne, And after þat, cruelly be-gonne In al hast to spoillen þe castel; And to schip þei brou?ten euery-del, Tresour &amp; gold, &amp; what þat þei may wynne, And on þe morwe to seille þei be-gynne, Stuffid with good, be þe Grekische se, Toward þe costis of Troye þe cite. Þe se was calm and fully at her wille, Boþe of tempest and of stormys ille, And clere also was þe bri?t[e] heuene, Þat in space almost of dayes seuene At a castel callid Tenedoun Þei aryve vj myle fro þe toun; And glad and li?t þei to lond[e] went. And after þat, I fynde, Parys sent His messanger strei?t vn-to þe kyng, Þat hym enformeþ of his hom commyng; Of her expleit he tolde hym euery-del. And Priamus likeþ wonder wel, Þat so manly þei han born hem oute, And made puplisched in þe toun aboute Þis tydynges with gret sollempnite, To hi?e &amp; lowe, þoru?-oute þe cite, Þat for Ioye þe most[e] and þe leste For remembraunce halwe [and holde] a feste, And þanke her goddes in ful humble wyse, With obseruaunces and with sacrifyse On her auteris, with gret deuocioun. And al þis while, he at Tenedoun Holdeth soiour with þe quene Eleyne, Þe whiche gan ful rewfully compleyne Hir vnkouþe lyf, to dwelle with straungers, Al dissolat among[es] prisoners, Fer sequestrid a-weye from hir contre, Solitarie in captiuite. Sche wepiþ &amp; crieþ with a pitous chere; Þe burbly wawes of hir eyen clere Liche welle stremys by hir chekis reyne; And for constreint of hir inward peyne Ful ofte a day hir song was weylaway, With sobbyng vois, þat sche so fer a-way Departid is from hir Menelaus. For whos absence in rage furious, Hir lif sche hateþ &amp; curseþ eke fortune; And in þis wo sche euere doth contune With-oute soiour, alwey more and more; And for hir breþer Pollux &amp; Castor, And for þe loue of hir dou?ter dere, Now pale and grene sche wexeþ of hir cher, Þat whilom was frescher for to sene Þan þe lillye on his stalke grene. Allas! chaunged is hir rosen hewe! And euere in on hir wo encreseth newe, Þat like no woman sche was to beholde; For ay sche wept as sche to water wolde. Til at þe last, in al hir heuynes, Paris to hir com of gentilnes, Hir to comforte and tapese hir rage— He besyeth hym hir sorwes to aswage, Seiyng to hir: “what may al þis mene, Þat ?e, allas, o goodly fresche quene, List þus ?our silfe in sorwyng disfigure? I wonder gretly how ?e may endure So moche water causeles to schede, Þat with wepyng han dewed so ?our wede; For liche a condut þe stremys renne doun, Lik to a penaunt in contricioun ?e ?ou disraye, allas, whi do ?e so! Lat be þis fare and lateth ouer go Al ?our wepyng, þou?t, and heuynes, And beth no more, my lady, in distres. Makeþ an ende nowe of ?our greuaunce, For al þe ese, comfort, and plesance Þat men may do, trusteþ ?e schul haue. It is but foly in sorwe þus to raue! Let passe ouer alle þis scharp[e] schowres, And here my trouþe: ?e and alle ?oures, Of what ?ou list schal haue suffisaunce; As ferforþe, and more habundaunce Þan ?e had among þe Grekis þere, I ?ou ensure, and beth no þing in fere, Þat I schal hold al þat I haue hi?t, On my trouþe, as I am trewe kny?t, In worde and dede with al myn hert entere.” And sche anon, with a woful chere, So as sche my?t for sobbyng þo suffice, Answerde ageyn in ful lawly wyse: “I wot,” quod sche, “wher me be loth or lef, Sith I am kau?t &amp; take at þis meschef, Vn-to ?our wil I may nat now with-seie; I am so bounde, þat I most obeie, Vnder ?our daunger, þat I may nat fle, In hold distreyned and captiuite. ?e wote also, be nature, oute of drede, Þat it ne longeth vn-to womanhede In straunge soille to stryuen or rebelle; An[d] namly þer, wher as hir querelle Schal haue no fauour nor sustened be. But ?ef ?e list now to han pite On me or myne, of ?our goodlyhede, ?e may of God disserue þank &amp; mede, Þat wil rewarde iustly alle þo Þat comfort hem þat ben in care &amp; wo.” “Now lady myn,” þanne quod Parys, “What þat may like or ben at ?our devys, Al schal be do, trusteth me ri?t wele; For be my trouþe, as fer as I can fele, In any þing þat may ?ou do plesaunce, ?e schal it haue with al habundaunce: Þis I ensure of heste not fallible; Beth nat a-gaste, but fully beth credyble To my wordis &amp; hestis euerychon.” And þer-with-al he lad hir ri?t anon In-to a place of royal apparaille, To comfort her, ?if it wolde availle, And secrely þer atwen hem two, Þis Paris first, with-outen more a-do, Spake vn-to hir &amp; seyde: “lady dere, I feyne nat, but speke of hert entere, And þat I hope ?e schal in dede fynde; Wherfor, I pray, enprenteth in ?our mynde What I seie, and in ?our remembraunce— Þis is to seien, sith ?e be puruyaunce Ben of þe goddis brou?t as now þer-to, And Fortune eke wil þat it be so, I dar afferme, pleinly for þe firste, Þat þei disposed haue nat for ?our wirst, But for ?our good, &amp; so ?e most it take. Wherfor, I rede, to letyn ouer-shake Al heuynes, and loke þat ?e be As glad and li?t here in þis contre, As þei ?e werne in ?our owne lond. For feythfully I do ?ou to vndirstonde, ?e schal haue here as moche habundance, On euery part, with ful sufficiaunce Of al þat may be to ?ou plesaunt: For of o þing I dar make avaunt, In þis contre, as it schal be founde, Of al plente we passyn and habounde More richely þan ?oure Grekis ?onder; And þei ?e ben from hem now assondre, Out of þe lond þat callid is Achaye, ?e haue no cause ?ow so to dismay, Sith at worschip and more reuerence, At more honour and gretter excellence ?e schal be cherisched þan ?e were a-fore. And where ?e pleine þat ?e haue forbore ?our owne lord and ben as now left sool, For whom ?e makyn al þis wo &amp; dool, ?e schal in haste be sette better at ese— For certeynly, so it nat displese Nor offende vn-to ?our womanhede, In stede of hym, I purpose, out of drede, To wedde ?ou and ben ?our trew[e] man, To loue &amp; serue in al þat euer I can, With-oute feynyng, to my lyues ende, And be to ?ou as lowly &amp; as kynde, As diligent and more laborious Þan whilom was ?oure Menelaus, In euery þing ?oure lustis to obeie— Hath here my trouth til tyme þat I deye. And þau? þat I in wordis be but pleyn, For loue of God, haueþ no disdeyn Of my request, nor gruchiþ nat at al; For, at þe lest, of þe stok royal I am discendid &amp; comme of as hi?e blood As Menelay, and of birþe as good; And can in loue to ?ou be more trewe Þan he was euer, and chaunge for no newe. Wherfor, stynteþ þus to pleyn &amp; wepe, And late som comfor[t] in ?our bosom crepe, ?our wo apeseth, whiche is not worþe an hawe, And som myrþe late in ?our hert adawe: Þis I beseche, and of womanhede To my wordis for to takyn hede.” “Allas,” quod sche, “how my?t þis be-falle, Þat haue left my frendis on &amp; alle In straunge lond, and am here but allone? How schuld I þan but I made mone? I haue no cause, God wot, for to pleye, Nor my chekis for to kepe dreye From salt[e] teris, allas! it wil nat be, Þat can noon end of myn aduersite. For in good feyth, it were a?en[e]s kynde So sodeynly to putten out of mynde Þilke þing þat, for Ioye or smert, In al þis world sitteþ nexte myn hert— For whom, allas, so sore I am distreyned. But, sith goddis han as now ordeyned No bettre chaunce of hope vn-to me, I can no more—I mote it take at gre And humblely accepte also her sonde; For I am feble her power to withstonde. Wherfor, I schal ageyn my wil [now] stryue, Al-be for wo myn hert I fele ryue, For to concente and lowly to admitte Þilke þing [fro] whiche I may not flitte, Maugre my wil, of necessite, Fully to obeye what ?e list do with me— It wil nat helpe þau? I seide nay.” And þus sche peyneth al þat [euere] sche may, Lite and lite hir sorwe to aswage. What schuld sche ay lyue in wo &amp; rage, To lese hir silfe, so tender a creature— An hert of stel ne my?t it not endure. But ay of women þe maner &amp; þe kynde, Þat þei can nat of sorwe make an ende Til þei be leiser han y-wept her fulle; But at þe last, whan þei gynne dulle To make sorwe, it happeþ hem as faste Þat by grace þei sone it ouer caste And li?tly cache counfort of her smerte— Þei be so tendre þat men may hem conuerte From wo to Ioye, &amp; þou?t from hem disseuere. Þer is no storme þat may lasten euere, As clerkis wyse in bokis liste discerne; Þing violent may nat be eterne; For after stormys Phebus bri?ter is. And so be comfort &amp; counseil of Parys, Sche dawed is of hir olde sorwe: For euene liche, as þe glade morwe, Of kynde sweþ þe dirke, blake ny?t, So be processe hir hert[e] wexeþ li?t, And of her wepyng dried is þe welle, Liche as þe story schal anon ?ou telle. Howe Paris and Heleyne were ressavyde into Troye, of Pryamus and his lordys; and of þe soroweful lamentacyoun that Cassandra made when she sawe þe weddynge. Whan þe quene þat callid is Eleyne A-dawed was of hir drery peyne, And þe wawes of hir heuy chere On hir chekis gonne for to clere, Paris, in herte fresche and amerous, In haste haþ sent to kyng Priamus For hors &amp; men and oþer apparaille, Clothes of gold ful noble of entaille, Made for Eleyne &amp; wrou?t[e] for þe nonys With riche perle &amp; many sondri stonys, A-geyn hir comyng in-to Troye toun. And after þat, Parys fro Tenedoun Schapeþ hym to lede hir in-to Troye; And Priamus mette hem on þe weye Ful ryally, as faste as he may hye, With many a lord in his companye, Ful many lady fresche &amp; wel be-seyn, And many mayde þat riden hem ageyn— First estatis and after comwneris. Now had Parys alle his prisoneris Set be-forn in ordre tweyn &amp; tweyne, And he rood next with þe quene Eleyne, And Dephebus vp-on þe toþer syde, And his kny?tes enviroun dide ride; But nexte hym rood þe worþi Eneas And þe Troyan, callid Pollidamas, His meyne swyng eche in his degre So gentilmanly, þat Ioye it was to se— Eche from oþer kepyng a certeyn space. And furþe þei ride but a soft[e] pace, Til þat þe kyng hem mette sodeynly, And hem receyveþ ful solempnely, As he best coude, &amp; goodly toke þe reyne In-to his hond of þe quene Eleyne, And hir conueyeþ furþe to his cite. Gret was þe pres þat abood to se, Of sondri folke, þat schove fast and croude; Þe schrille trumpettis wern y-reised loude— Vp to þe skye goth þe blisful sown Whan al þis peple entreþ in þe toun— And many a-noþer diuers instrument, Þat al to-forn in at þe gatis went, In sondry wyse þat made melodie, Þat to heren þe heuenly armonye Be musik touchid vp-on string &amp; corde, So euen in on &amp; iustly þei acorde, It wold an hert rauische in-to Ioye. And whan þei wern entred in-to Troye, Amyd his paleys kyng Priamus a-li?t; And anoon, as fast as euere he my?t, In-to a chambre, riche &amp; wel be-seye, Þe quene Eleyne in hast he doth conueye, Comaundyng with hert[e], wil, and þou?t His officers þat hir faile nou?t Of any þing þat sche can be-þinke. Þe spicis partid, anoon þe wyn þei drink, And þan þe kyng toke leue til soper, And sche þer-whiles chaungeþ hir attir. But of þe Ioye þat was in þe toun, In eche place wher men went vp &amp; doun, I am to rude, sothly, al to wryte, So moche in hert þe Troyans hem delite, Þat saufe &amp; sounde retourned is Parys— Þei wende haue be for Ioye in paradis, Þat he so wel spedde in his Iourne, And hath nat on loste of his meyne, Wher-of þei ben in hert[e] glad &amp; li?t. And in al haste after þe nexte ny?t, As writ Guydo, with-oute tariyng long, Erly on morwe, a-for þe larke songe, In Pallas temple, as myn auctor seiþe, Assured was be oþe &amp; eke be feiþe Þe bond of wedlok of hym &amp; Eleyne, For euer-more to last a-twen hem tweyne, Þe knot is knyt of þis sacrament. And þis was don fully be thassent, First of þe kyng, and also be thavis Of al þe cite in fauour of Parys. And so þe feste and gret solempnyte Contwnyd was with moche ryalte, Of þis weddyng in myrthe &amp; solace, Þorou?-oute þe toun be viii dayes space. What schuld I write þe reuel or þe daunces, Þe fresche array or þe countenaunces, Þe stole touchis, þe lokis amerous, Þe prevy gruchyng of hem þat wer Ielous, Þe grete iustis, bordis, or tornay, Amyd palastre with many sondry play, Þe diuers coursis eke at euery feste, Þe large plente don vn-to þe leste, Þe straunge metis, þe manere of seruyse— I haue noon englische al for to deuyse— I passe ouer, for I was not þere. But whan þis weddyng cam vn-to þe ere Of Cassandra, and first it dide espie, A þousand sithe “allas!” sche gan to crye Of pitous wo with vntressid heris, And seide þus al be-spreint with teris: “O wrechid Troye, erryng in þis cas, With-Inne þi silfe to suffre þis trespas, For to concent vn-to swyche folye, In sustenyng of foule auoutr[y]e, Þat Paris schulde takyn vn-to wyve Þe quene Eleyne whos husbond is alyve! O woful Troye, to cruel is þi fate! For to be war it is almost to late! The tyme is come, þou schal[t] distroyed be! For many fader schal his sone se Hol in þe morwe, þat schal be slawe or eve Amyd þe feld, þat wil him sore greue, And many wif sore schal be-wepe To se hir husbonde with large woundis depe Girt þoru? þe body, pale, cold, &amp; grene! Allas, howe schal ?e þe sorwe mow sustene! A, wrecchid modris! how schal ?e endure To se ?oure childre be cruel auenture A-fore ?ou slayn with-oute remedie!— It wil nat help, þou? ?e clepe &amp; crie.

What! trow[e] ?e his þefte and cruel dede Schal passe þus?—Nay! with-outen drede, Þe swerd of vengaunce schal ful scharp[e] bite For his offence, &amp; we schal bere þe wyte— Paleis &amp; hous to seen, with-Inne a þrowe, And touris hi?e leide on þe erþe lowe! Allas, allas!

Allas, þou art [þe] rote &amp; grounde of al, Of many drery fest[e] funeral Þat schal be holde amonge vs in þis toun!” And in þis wyse Cassandra vp &amp; doun Aboute ran in subbarbe and in strete, And crieth euer, whom þat euer sche mete, Ful ofte syþe: “allas and weillawey!” Til Priamus, be-cause of hir affray, And for þe noyse þat sche dide make, With-oute more, anon he doth hir take And bynd[e] fast, fetrid in presoun, With-oute mercy or remyssioun. Þei take noon hede to hir sadde trouþe, Nor to hir wordis—it was þe more rouþe— But schet hir vp in bondis gret &amp; strong, With-oute pite, where sche abidiþ longe. And þus in prisoun a while I leue hir mourne, And to [þe] Grekis I wil ageyn returne. Of the sorowe that Kynge Menelay made when he herd that Parys had ravisshede his wyff; and of þe manly comforde and councele þat Agamenon gave hym for to revenge hym. The vnhappy tyme &amp; þe same while Þat Fortune falsly gan to smyle Vp-on Troyans &amp; bad hem [to] be merye, For whiche hi?ly þei gan her goddis herie, Wenyng in Ioye to haue ben assured wele, No þing aduerting þe turnyng of þe whele Of hir þat lastiþ stable but a throwe— Whan men most trust, sche can make a mowe, Turne hir forhed, &amp; hir face writhe, (Suche Ioye sche haþe hir doubilnes to kiþe, And to wrappe hir clernes vnder cloude), Ageyn whos my?t no man may hym schrowde— Whan sche most flateriþ, þan sche is lest to trist: For in her Ioye þe Troyans litel wist What sche ment to her confusioun. For while þat þei aboute in al þe toun Wenden of Grekis haue geten ful recur Of her damages, &amp; euere to haue be sure Þoru? þilke pray þat Parys had[de] wonne, Þe wykke fame &amp; rumor is y-ronne With swyfte wynges, of al þat þei han wrou?t. To Menelay þe tydyngges wern [y-]brou?t, Whils he abood with Nestor at Pyra, First of þe temple in Cyther[e]a, How it was spoilled, &amp; þe robberye Of gold &amp; tresour, &amp; þe tyranye Vp-on his men be Troyans execute, Boþe of assaillyng &amp; of al þe sute Þat on Grekis þei made cruelly, And how þat þei ne spared outterly Man nor woman þat com in her weye, Þat þei ne toke, &amp; ladden as for praye To her sch[i]ppes, and also of þe fy?t A-for þe castel, þat was on þe ny?t. And aldirlast he hereth of his wif, Whom he louede as mykel as his lif— More tendirly, God wot, a þousand folde. For whom, astonyed, at hert he wexe as colde As any ston, and paleth of his hewe. His hertly wo so inly gan renewe, Þat first whan he herde hir name sovne, With-out[e] more anoon he fel a-swovne; For he ne my?t endure for to stonde, Til duke Nestor toke hym by þe honde And hym awoke of his dedly swowe. “Allas,” quod he, “why haue I lost, &amp; howe, Mi lives lust, myn hertly suffisaunce! A, com now deth and make of my greuance Fully an ende with þi cruel dart, Þat wounded am þoru? on euery parte— Myn hert, also, korve in euery veyne For ?ow, my wif, for ?ow, myn owne Eleyne, Þat be deuorcid fro me, weillawey! Far-wel my Ioye, farwel myn olde pley! Now han strangeris of ?ou pocessioun, Whiche wil to me be ful confusioun. Allas, I not how þei ?ou cherische or trete, My faire Eleyne, þat wer to me so mete! Now ?e ar gon, pensifhed me slethe— I may nat waite now but after dethe.” And aftir þis, amyd of al his wo, Þis Menelay schope hym for to go To his regne, but litel þer be-syde; He axeth hors &amp; seide he wolde ride Sool to compleyne of þat he felt hym greue. But al þis while Nestor wil nat leue To go with hym for consolacioun, Of frendly ri?t hauyng compassioun, Hym to comforte with al his ful[le] my?t, Ledyng with hym many worþi kny?t In-to þe regne of þis Menelaus. Þan, first of al, þe story telleþ vs, How þei sent for Agamenoun, And for Castor to com to hym anoon, And for Pollux, ?if it my?t[e] be; And whan þei wer comen alle þre, And saie her broþer in swiche meschef brou?t, Almost mordred wiþ his owne þou?t, With-oute abood þe wyse Agamenoun To ?if hym counforte &amp; consolacioun Dide his labour &amp; diligence entere, Seiyng to hym, ri?t as ?e schal here: “O broþer myn, what wo, what heuynes, What dedly sorwe þus inly may oppres ?our kny?tly hert or trouble ?oure manhede, More furiously y-wis þan it is nede; For þou? þat ri?t requered outerly ?ow for to sorwe and had cause why, ?et, me semeth, by iuste prouidence, ?e schulde sli?ly dissymble ?oure offence— Sith eche wiseman in his aduersite Schulde feyne cher &amp; kepen in secre Þe inward wo þat bynt hym in distresse— Be manly force rathest þer compesse Þe sperit of Ire and malencolie, Where þe peple it sonest my?t espie. It is a doctrine of hem þat be prudent, Þat whan a man with furie is to-rent, To feyne chere til tyme he se leyser Þat [he] of vengaunce kyndle may þe fer; For sorwe oute-schewid, ?if I shal nat feine, Who-so take hede, it doth þinges tweyne: It causeth frendis for to si?e sore, And his enymyes to reioische more— Þi frende in hert is sory of nature, Þin enemy glad of þi mysaventure. Wherfore, in hert, whan wo doth most abounde, Feyne gladnes þin enmy to confounde, And schewe in cher as þou rou?tist nou?t Of þing þat is most greuous in þi þou?t. And wher þou hast most mater to compleyne, Make þer good face &amp; glad in port þe feine; For in-to teris þou? þou al distille, And rende þi silfe, as þou woldest þe spille, It helpith nat to aleggen þi greuance: For nouþer honour nor pursut of vengaunce, With sorwe makyng mow ben execut— Þou? it last ay, þer cometh þere-of no frut. Men seyn how he þat can dissymble a wrong, How he is sli?e and of herte stronge; And who can ben peisible in his smerte, It is a tokene he hath a manly herte, Nat to wepen as wommen in her rage, Whiche is contrarie to an hi?e corage. With word &amp; wepyng for to venge oure peyne, Be no menys to worschip to attayne; Lat vs with swerde &amp; nat with wordis fi?t, Oure tonge apese, be manhod preve oure my?t: Word is but wynde, &amp; water þat we wepe, And þou? þe tempest and þe flodis depe Of þis two encresen euere-mo, Þei may nat do but augmente oure wo— And to oure foon, þer-of whan þei here, Boþe of oure dool &amp; oure heuy chere, Al is to hem but encres of Ioye. Wherfore, broþir, a while doþe a-coye Þe cruel torment þat byndeþ ?ow so sore; For in prouerbe it haþ ben said ful ?ore, Þat þe prowes of a manly kny?t Is preued most in meschef, and his my?t: To ben assured in aduersite, Strongly sustene what wo þat it be, Nat cowardly his corage to submitte In euery pereil, nor his honour flitte Þoru? no dispeire, but hopen al-wey wel, And haue a trust, trewe as any stel, Tacheven ay what he take on honde. For finally I do ?ou vndirstonde, Þat of hym silfe who haþ good fantasie To sette vp-on and putte in Iupartie, What þat be-falle, [or] hap what hap[pe] may, Takyng what chaunce wil turnen on his play, The fyn of whiche gladly is victorie, Þei feile selde of þe palme of glorie. And tyme is now, to speke in wordis fewe, O broþir myn, manhod for to schewe, To pluk vp herte &amp; ?ou to make strong; And to venge ?our damages &amp; ?oure wronge, We schal echon help &amp; leye to honde— Kynges, dukes, and lordis of þis londe— And attonys done oure besynes, I ?ou behete, ?our harmys to redresse. And in dispit of whom þat euere vs lette, We schal vs loge &amp; oure tentis sette Euene in þe felde a-fore Troye toun, And leyne a sege to her distruccioun, Al-be her-of I sette as now no day. But, broþir, first, in al þe haste we may, Lete make lettris, with-oute more sermoun, To alle þe lordis of þis regioun, Of þis mater touching ?oure villenye, To come to-gidre &amp; schape remedie— Þis is theffect of al þat I can seyn.” And þus relessid somwhat of his peyne Is Menelaus þoru? comfort of his broþer; For whan he sawe it my?t[e] ben noon oþer, And of his tale þe kyng made an ende, Þoru?-oute þe londe he dide his letteris sende, First to his kyn and to his allye To come to helpe hym of her curtesye. And first of alle to Menelaus Cam Achilles, and with hym Patroclus, And alder-nexte stronge Diomede And many an oþer to helpen in þis nede. And alle echon, in open parlement, Þei wer acordid ful by on assent To be gouerned as Agamenoun List to ordeyne in his discrecioun— Of þis viage þei made hym gouernour, And of her ost chefteyn and emperour. Among hem alle þer was ful vnite Vp-on Troyans avengid for to be, And from þis purpos neuer to remewe. But first, I fynde, Paris for to swe, Þe viage toke þe worþi breþer tweyne, Pollux and Castor, to recure Eleyne. ?et neuer-þe-les, as somme bokis telle, Þat þese kynges no lenger wolde dwelle, But as fast as Paris was a-goon Þei toke a schip and folweden a-noon, With many worþi in her companye; And dout[e]les, but ?if bokis lye, Þat or þei hadde sailed daies þre To-Troye-ward in þe large se, Þe tempest roos &amp; wyndes dide awake, Þe heuene dirke with þe cloudis blake, Þat han þe day turned in-to ny?t, And bri?t[e] Phebus was myrked of his li?t— Þe fery leuene and stroke of þe þondre Smote in þe mast &amp; schiverid it a-sondre. It was so dirke no li?t my?t adawe; Þe see gan swelle with many sturdy wawe Þat ryse on hi?te, large as any mount, And fille doun &amp; swappid in þe frount Evene of þe schip, &amp; ploungid it ful lowe— Now vp, now doun, for-cast &amp; ouer-þrowe Her schippes werne with tempest to &amp; fro: Þe fomy water grene, white, and blo Of feruent boilyng, &amp; as piche eke blak With storme &amp; wynde, þat al goth to wrake; So hidously þe blastis at hem dryve, Þat euery bord gan from oþer ryve, And al is perschid, þer skapeþ nat a man, But al attonys, as I reherse can, Be dede &amp; dreynt with tempest sodeynly— Þer skaped noon, I sey ?ou certeynly, Excepte þe breþre, whiche, as bokis telle, Þe ton in heuene, þe toþer lowe in helle Wer lordis made to abide eternaly. And some feynyn in her poysy, How þe goddis han hem deified Hi?e in heuene and y-stellyfied— After her schippes wern y-go to wrake— Þei were made sterris in þe ?odyak, And to þe signe transformed outterly, Whiche of clerkis is callid Gemyny. Þe whiche signe and constellacioun Is to Mercurie hous and mansioun, And is of kynde mene &amp; masculyn, In whiche þe Egle and also þe Dolphyn Han her arisyng be reuolucioun; þe tail also aboue of þe Dragoun Is exaltat in þe þridde gre Of Gemyny, whiche signe haþ most pouste In hond &amp; armys of man—out of doute— Liche as Lucyna halt hir course aboute. And in þis wyse wer þe breþre tweyne To heuene rapt, as poetis feyne, After þe tempest—?e gete no more of me— For in þis wyse þe Grekis in þe see An ende made, and þat ful rewfully: Þis ernest first cam vnhappily To hem echon, as gynnyng of her wo And final chaunce to þe breþer two. The descripcion of þe moste part of princes þat kame with þe Grekis for þe destruccyoun of Troye. But for-as-moche as Dares Frigius Was in his boke whilom corious Þe forme of Troyens &amp; Grekis to discryve, Liche as he saw—þis auctor by his lyve— Þe schap, þe forme, and complexioun, Boþe of þe party of hem of Troye toun, And of þe Grekis, be good avisement, In tyme of trewe among hem as he went, Seyng þe maner of her gouernaunce, Her port, her chere, with euery circumstance, Namly of þoo þat wer of hi?e degre— He nat for-gat color nor qualite, Condiciouns, and also her stature— Al to discrive Dares dide his cure, In Grekysche tong, be-gynnyng at Eleyne, Liche as to-forn ?e han herde me seyne, Of hir beute and hir semlynes How ceryously Guydo doth expresse (Saue he seide, in a litel space, A strype þer was endelonge hir face, Whiche, as he writ, be-cam hir wonder wel, Embelyssching hir beute [e]uerydel, Like as Dares makeþ discripcioun). And first he seiþ how kyng Agamenoun Was of good schap &amp; hi?e of his stature, And my?te in labour at þe best endure— Vnpacient to lyuen in quiete, He was to armys so egal and so mete— Of colour white, &amp; good proporcioun, And flewmatik of his complexioun, Discret and hardy, &amp; wonder vertuous, And of speche ri?t facundious, And kowde him wel in euery þing demene. But Menelay of stature was but mene, Proporcioned atwixe schort and longe, Worþi in armys, deliuere, &amp; also strong, And of corage and hert[e] vigerous, Semly also, and ay more desyrous To lyue in werre, rather þan in pees. And, ferthermore, to speke of Achilles, He was ri?t fair and of gret semlynes, With hawborne her, crispyng for þiknes, With eyen glawke, large, stepe, and grete, And brod schuldrid, with brest ful square [and] mete, Tendure in armys fel and coragous, And of his loke wonder amerous, Hi?e of stature, and large of ?iftes eke, And more of strengþe þan any oþer Greke. And to spende he sette litel charge, He was of herte so plenteuous &amp; large, And in the feld passyng chiualrous. And for to telle forþe of Tantalus, Of sangwyn hewe, havyng moche of red, Diuers eyed, ay mevyng in his hed, Of huge makyng &amp; also of gret strengþe, Wel answeryng his brede to his lengþe, Hatyng to stryve where he saw no nede, Ri?t trewe of worde also, as I rede; And neuere quarel wolde he take on honde To fi?t[e] fore, but he my?t vndirstonde Þat it were fully gronded vp-on ri?t, And þanne he wolde quite him lik a kny?t. Oyleus Aiax was ri?t corpulent; To be wel clad he sette al his entent; In riche array he was ful corious, Al-þei?e he were of body corsyous, Of armys gret, with schuldris square &amp; brode, It was on hym al-most an hors[e] lode, Hi?e of stature &amp; boistous in a prees, And of his speche rude and rekkeles— Ful many worde in ydel hym asterte, And but a coward was [he] of his herte. A-noþer Aiax, Thelamonivs, Þer was also, discret &amp; vertuous, Wonder fair and semly to beholde, Whos her was blak, &amp; vpward ay gan folde In compas wyse, rounde as any spere; And of mvsik was þer noon his pere, Hauyng a vois ful of melodie, Ri?t wel entvned as by armonye, And was inventif for to counterfete Instrumentis, boþe smale and grete, In sondry wyse longyng to mvsik. And for al þis, ?et had he gret practik In armys eke, &amp; was a noble kny?t— No man more orpid nor hardier to fi?t Nor desyrous for to han victorie, Devoide of pompe, hatyng al veyn glorie, Al ydel laude, spent &amp; blow in veyn. Of Vlixes what schal I also seyn?— Þat was so noble &amp; worþi in his daies, Ful of wyles and slei?ty at assayes, In menyng double and ri?t deceyueable, To forge a lesyng also wonder able; With face pleyn he coude make it towe, Merie wordid, and but selde lowe, In conseillynge discret &amp; ful prudent, And in his tyme þe moste elloquent, And halpe to Grekis often in her nede. And for to speken of worþi Diomede, Ful wel compact &amp; growe wel on lenþe, Of sturdy port and famus eke of strenþe, Large brestid, &amp; fers also of fi?t, And deseyueable of what þat euer he hi?t— Hasty, testif, to smyte rek[e]les, And medlif ay, and but selde in pes, To his seruantis ful impacient, And baratous wher þat euer he went, For litel wroþe of dispocisioun, And lecherous of complexioun, And had in loue oft[e] sythes his part, Brennynge at hert wiþ Cupides dart, And specheles ful oft felt[e] soor. What schal I seyn [eke] of duke Nestor?— Of longe stature &amp; wel compact with-al, With kurbe schuldris &amp; of myddel smal, In hondis strong, with armys large &amp; rounde, In counseillyng prudent &amp; wys y-founde; Whos wordis werne sugrid with plesaunce, Vp-on his frende hauyng ay remembraunce: For of his trouþe he ne koude feyne, But in anger he my?t hym nat refreyne; He was so fret wiþ malencolye, Þat no man my?t his Ire modefie, Al-be it laste but a litel space— Who coude hym suffre, anon it wolde pace, Li?tly it cam and li?tly went a-way. And Protheselavs was fresche of array, Wonder semly &amp; of gret bewte— I trowe a fairer no man my?t[e] se— Of good stature and deliuere &amp; li?t, No man more swyfte; &amp; to speke of my?t, Of his makyng he was passyng strong, Fers of corage &amp; loth to take a wrong. And to telle of Neptolonius, He was of makyng wonder corsious, Whos her was blak, schynyng as doþ get, With eyen rounde, brood[e], stepe, and gret, Large brestid, wiþ a risyng bak, And in speche stamered whan he spak; But in causes he coude medle wele, And in þe lawe ful depe he dide fele, For al his lust was be-set on plees. But for to telle of Pallamydes, Kyng Naulus sone, with-outen any wene, Of face faire, of body longe and lene, Of manful hert, hardy in bataille, And desirous his enmy to assaille— Famylier, curteis, and tretable In alle his dedis, &amp; inli worschipable, In ?ifyng large, &amp; passyng of gret fame, Of whos bounte ful wyde sprange þe name In many londe, þe story telleþ þus. And nexte, I fynde how Polydamvs, Þe worþi Greke, was of gret þiknes, Of wombe swolle, enbosid with fatnes, Þat onneþe he my?t him silfe sustene; And ?et of hert he was ful proude &amp; kene, Ri?t surquedous &amp; ful of pensifnes, And seld[e] glad, so þou?t dide hym oppres. But Machaon, lik as writ Guydo, Of longe &amp; schort was atwixe two, Fel, proude, &amp; fers, deuoyde of pacience, And vengable, who hym dide offence; And ?it he was ballid as a cote, On whos forhede, euene by þe rote, Þe here was falle &amp; wasted clene awey, And selde or neuer he wolde slepe a-day. And ouermore, to tellen of Cryseyde, Mi penne stumbleþ, for longe or he deyde My maister Chaucer dide his dilligence To discryve þe gret excellence Of hir bewte, and þat so maisterly, To take on me it were but hi?e foly, In any wyse to adde more þer-to; For wel I wot, anoon as I haue do, Þat I in soth no þanke disserue may, Be-cause þat he in writyng was so gay— And but I write, I mote þe trouþe leue Of Troye boke, and my mater breue And ouer-passe and nat go by and by As Guydo doþ in ordre ceryously. And þus I most don offencioun Þoru?e necligence or presumpcioun: So am I sette euene amyddes tweyne! Gret cause haue I &amp; mater to compleyne On Antropos &amp; vp-on hir envie, Þat brak þe þrede &amp; made for to dye Noble Galfride, poete of Breteyne, Amonge oure englisch þat made first to reyne Þe gold dewe-dropis of rethorik so fyne, Oure rude langage only tenlwmyne. To God I pray, þat he his soule haue, After whos help of nede I most[e] crave, And seke his boke þat is left be-hynde Som goodly worde þer-in for to fynde, To sette amonge þe crokid lynys rude Whiche I do write; as, by similitude, Þe ruby stant, so royal of renoun, With-Inne a ryng of copur or latoun, So stant þe makyng of hym, dout[e]les, Among oure bokis of englische per[e]les: Þei arn ethe knowe, þei ben so excellent; Þer is no makyng to his equipolent; We do but halt, who-so takeþ hede, Þat medle of makyng, with-outen any drede. Whan we wolde his stile counterfet, We may al day oure colour grynde &amp; bete, Tempre our a?our and vermyloun: But al I holde but presumpcioun— It folweþ nat, þerfore I lette be. And first of al I wil excuse me And procede as I haue be-gonne, And þoru? his fauour certeyn, ?if I konne, Of Troye boke for to make an ende; And þer I lefte ageyn I wil now wende, Vn-to Cryseyde, and þou? to my socour Of rethorik þat I haue no flour Nor hewes riche, stonys nor perre— For I am bare of alle coriouste, Þoru? crafty speche to enbrovde with her sleve— ?et for al þat, now I wil not leue, But ben as bolde as Baiard is, þe blynde, Þat cast no peril what wey[e] þat he fynde; Ri?t so wil I stumble forþe of hede For vnkonnyng, &amp; take no better hede, So as I can, hir bewte to discriue. Þat was in soth of alle þo on-lyue On þe fayrest, þis Calchas dou?ter dere, Þer-to of schap, of face, and of chere, Þer my?t[e] [be] no fairer creature: To hi?e nor lowe, but mene of stature— Hir sonnysche her, liche Phebus in his spere, Bounde in a tresse, bri?ter þanne golde were, Doun at hir bak, lowe doun be-hynde, Whiche with a þrede of golde sche wolde bynde Ful ofte syþe of a-custummaunce; Þer-to sche hadde so moche suffisaunce Of kyndes wirke, with-outen any were— [And] Saue hir browes Ioyn[e]den y-fere, No man koude in hir a lake espien. And, ferþermore, to speken of hir eyen, Þei wer so persyng, heuenly, &amp; so clere, Þat an herte [ne] my?t hym silf[e] stere Ageyn hir schynyng, þat þei nolde wounde Þoru?-out a brest, God wot, &amp; bi?onde. Also sche was, for al hir semlynes, Ful symple &amp; meke, &amp; ful of sobirnes, Þe best norissched eke þat my?t[e] be, Goodly of speche, fulfilde of pite, Facundious, and þer-to ri?t tretable, And, as seiþ Guydo, in loue variable— Of tendre herte &amp; vnste[d]fastnes He hir accuseth, and newfongilnes. And aftir þis, Dares doþe reherse Amongis oþer, how þe kyng of Perce Cam to Grekis with many worþi kny?t To helpe &amp; furþere with al his ful[le] my?t. Þe whiche kyng was of stature longe, And wonder fat and, as he writ, ri?t stronge; Whos berd and her, reed as flawme of fire, With eyen stepe, and feruent of desyre To haue a-do, and sterne of chere &amp; loke, And ofte syþes of sodeyn Ire he quoke— And had wertis plente in his face. And þus Dares, schortly for to pace, No more of Grekis writeþ, as I fynde, But of Troyans for to make mynde, Ceriously he doþe his stile dresse Hem to discryue, as I schal expresse. And first he seith how kyng Priamus Was of his chere benigne and gracious, Of hi?e stature, with lymys sklender &amp; longe, Delityng moche in musik &amp; in songe; And specialy he was most desyrous To heren songis þat wern amerous— A semly man, and of gret hardynes, And spake but lowe, as bokis vs expresse: Devoide of drede, hatyng flaterye, And alle þat koude ouþer glose or lye, Trewe of his worde, &amp; to euery wy?t He dide pleinly equite and ri?t; For no mede hym list nat to decline, And loued erly on morwe for to dyne. In his tyme on þe worþiest Of alle kynges, and he þat loued best Worþi kny?tes; &amp; alle þat he knewe Þat manful were and of hert[e] trewe, He koude cherische, no man half so wele, With gold &amp; ?iftes, þat þei my?t[e] fele His grete fredam &amp; largesse eke with al. And of his sones, for to rekne hem alle, Þe first of birþe, so as bokis telle, Was worþi Ector, of kny?thod spring &amp; welle, Flour of manhod, of strengþe per[e]les, Sadde &amp; discret &amp; prudent neuere-þe-les, Crop &amp; rote, grounde of chiualrie, Of cher demvre, and of curtesye He was example—þer-to of sobirnes A verray merour, &amp; for his gentilnes In his tyme þe most[e] renomed, To reknen al, and of goodlyhed Þe most[e] famus, [and] in pes &amp; werre Ferþest spoke of, boþe ny?e &amp; ferre. On eche part he was so vertuous, And to be loued þe most gracious, Of brawn &amp; bonys compact be mesure, So wel breþid in armys to endure, So wel parformed be proporcioun, So quik, so lifly, and of most renoun, So huge made, so wel growe on lengþe, So wel complet for to haue gret strengþe, Þat in þis worlde, ?if I schal nat feyne, Was neuer noon þat fully my?t attayne To þe prowes of þis worþi kny?t, To rekne his hert as wel as his my?t. And þer-wiþ-al so wys and avysee, Þe low[l]iest eke of his degre To riche &amp; pore, and of wordis fewe. Vn-to alle suche chere he koude schewe, Of his presence þat glad was euery wy?t, Whan þei at leyser hadde of him a si?t; He was so benygne to hem of þe toun, And to his enmyes lyk a fers lyoun He koude hym schewe, whan it was to do; And in þe felde þer my?t[e] no man so, To rekene al his labour, half endure: For þe story doth vs pleyn assure Þat he was neuer wery in bataille, Nor feint in hert his fomen to assaille. Of alle good I fynde he was þe beste; Prowes &amp; vertu in him wer sette at reste So passyngly, þat neuer was ne schal Noon bore of modir to be perigal To hym of manhod nor of chiualrie: For alle he passed, but ?if bokis lye, In whom Nature was no þing to wyte, Saue in his tonge he was let a lite; And, as som auctours make mencioun, He was sangwyn of complexioun. And, ferþermore, his broþer Dephebus, Lik as I fynde, and also Elenus, Were liche Priam, þat sothly of hem þre Was hard tespien any diuersyte Of schap, of forme, or of countenaunce, Saue of age, þer was no variaunce: Her fader olde and þei wer ?ong &amp; li?t. And Dephebus was a worþi kny?t, And had in armys fame &amp; excellence; And Elenus in clergie and science Was wel expert, &amp; toke but litel hede Of alle þe werre, kny?thod, nor manhede. But Troylus schortly ?if I schal discryve, Þer was of hert non manlier on lyue, Nor more likly in armys to endure: Wel woxe on hei?te and of good stature, ?ong, fresche, &amp; lusty, hardy as a lyoun, Deliuere and strong as any champioun, And perigal of manhod and of dede He was to any þat I can of rede In doring do, þis noble worþi kny?t, For to fulfille þat longeþ to a kny?t. Þe secunde Ector for his worþines He callid was, and for his hi?e prowes Duryng þe werre, he bare hym ay so wel; Þer-to in loue as trewe as any stele, Secre and wys, stedefast of corage, Þe most[e] goodly also of visage Þat my?t[e] be, and benigne of cher, With-oute chaunge, &amp; of on hert entere. He was alwey feithful, iust, &amp; stable, Perseueraunt, and of wil inmvtable Vp-on what þing he onys set his herte, Þat doubilnes my?t hym nat peruerte— In his dedis he was so hool and pleyn; But on his foon, þe sothe for to seyn, He was so fers þei my?t him nat withstonde Whan þat he hilde his bloodly swerde on hond: Vn-to [þe] Grekis deth and confusioun, To hem of Troye shelde and proteccioun; And his kny?thod schortly to acounte, Þer my?t in manhod no man him surmounte, Þoru? þe worlde þou? men wolde seke, To reknen al, Troyan nouþer Greke, Noon so namyd of famus hardynes, As bokis olde of hym bere witnes, Excepte Ector, þer was nat swiche anoþer. And aftir hym, to speken of his broþer, I mene Paris, most passyng of bewte, Þat in þis worlde no man my?t[e] se, In verray soþe, a more semly kny?t; For as I rede, þat he, be title of ri?t, Of fairnes bare awey þe flour— With lokkis ?elwe lik gold were of colour. And in schetyng most was his delite, Hauyng in hunting a [ful] gret appetite; And as Dares likith hym discryue, Þe best archer on þer-of a-lyve; And of his hond was eke a noble kny?t, A manly [man], deliuere and of good my?t; And in þe werre preued wel he was. And, as I rede, þe Troyan Eneas, As myn auctor listeth to endite, Was wel brested and of body lite, And bare in Troye wonder gret estat; In his werkis discret and temperat, And hadde a fame of passyng elloquence, Wys of counseil and of gret sapience, Most renomed also of lettrure, Delytyng moche in bokis &amp; scripture, And euere glad, boþe of port &amp; chere, Sterne of his loke, with persyng eyen clere. And amonge alle dwellyng in þe toun, To speke of goodys and pocessioun, Of castels and towres gret plente, I fynde, soþely, þat noon in þat cite Ne my?t atteyne vn-to his reches; And hadde also, for al his worþines, Of gold and mebles passing gret tresour. And his felawe, he, dawn Anthenor, Was sclendre &amp; longe, &amp; of gret dalyaunce, And circumspect in al his gouernaunce, Wel be-louyd also of Priamus, And of wordis wonder copious, Resownyng ay in-to myrþe and pley. And he was Iapyng al þe longe day Among his feris and in companye, So driely þat no man my?t espie, So sobir he was in his contenaunce, Þat euery wy?t hadde gret plesaunce To here hym talke, whan þat he was glad; And, al-be-it þat he of port was sad, ?it al his speche ful of bourdis was. And his sone, callid Pollydamas, Was lik his fader of stature &amp; of mak, I-thewed wel, þat þer was no lak In his persone, gentil and ri?t trewe, Wonder strong and pale also of hewe, And to Ire sterid sodeynly, Al-be in wordis he kept hym couertly— But al his hete passe wolde anoon. And to telle of kyng Meryon, Large brestid, &amp; of his makyng al Þe best[e] compact and þe most[e] tal Of schap and forme þat men koude fynde, And so wel parformed vp by kynde, Þat non was lik to hym, ny?e nor fer: His lokkis ?elwe, &amp; crispyng was his her— Stille of his port, and gentil with to play, And inly strong maystries for to assay; Wonder curteis, to no wi?t dispitous, And wrou?t in armys dedis meruelous, As in þis boke her-after schal be sene. Nowe after hym, to Eccuba þe quene, Lik þe story, my style y mote encline— Whos lymys alle dide more decline To schap of man þan to womanhede, As seith Guydo; but in werke and dede Sche was in soth þe most[e] womanly, Þe best avised, and most prudently In hir dedis koude hir silfe gouerne, Þat mannys with my?t[e] nat discerne To fynde a bet, dout[e]les, þan sche— So trewe example of femynyte Sche was in soþe, and to euery wi?t Benigne of port and gracious of si?t: To pore also pitous and merciable, And vn-to nedy wonder charitable. Þe wif of Ector, hir dou?ter in lawe, After hir lore mochel dide drawe, Andronomecha, þe feiþful trewe wyf, So good, so iust, þe whiche in al hir lyf In honeste dide hir moste delite— Longe of hir schap, with brestis faire &amp; whyte, With rody chekis, ennewed by mesure, With persyng eyen, of angelik figure— Lik gold hir tressis, &amp; rosyn lippis rede I-liche fresche, of colour no þing dede. Þer-to sche was of chere þe goodlieste To riche &amp; pore, and spake alwey þe beste Of euery wi?t, ay helping what sche my?t, Þat no man trist went out of hir si?t; And ouer þis, euery gentil-man Sche forþre wolde in al þat euer sche can, And gladly euer dide hir dilligence To gete grace to hem þat dide offence:— Þis was hir vsage and condicioun, Sche was so ful of compassioun Þat women alle my?ten of hir lere. And Cassandra, hir ovne dou?ter dere, Was of stature wonder wommanly, Of colour white, and þer-with ri?t semly (Saue in her face in soundri places were Many wertys growyng here &amp; þere); And al hir Ioy and felicite Was to kepe hir virginite; And freelte þat wommen han of kynde, Þoru? vertu moral sche put out of mynde, Of alle foly fleyng occasioun; And ay in studie &amp; contemplacioun Of sondry bokis sche wolde [hir] occupie, And specially of astronomye; Of prophesye a spirit had[de] sche; And somme men seyn sche was on of þe þre, Of þe women þat Cebile bare þe name, Of whom þe renoun floureth &amp; þe fame Vn-to þis day, and is as ?et but grene. And for to telle of ?ong[e] Pollicene, And discriue hir bewte vp and doun, It were in soþe a presumpcioun To take on me now so gret a þing, To clymbe so hi?e &amp; passe my konnyng, Siþen Nature in forgyng of þis mayde, Hir konnyng al outterly assaied To make hir fair aboue eche creature, And seide proudly: “se how I, Nature, Whan [þat] me list, enbelissche can my wirke: Liche as Phebus among þe cloudis dirke Is passyng clere, so in comparisoun, I can my wirke and operacioun Ri?t as me list adourne &amp; make fair, So peint &amp; florische, it schal nat apeire; And my colours so craftily dispose, Of þe lillie and þe fresche rose, And so ennew þat þei schal nat fade, But ay ben on; and in þis wyse I made My dere dou?ter, ?e wite whom I mene, Þe ?onge, fresche, faire Policene, A-skans þat non can þis crafte but I!” Þus in hir wirke bosted outerly Nature hir silf, whan sche þis maide wrou?t, As sche þat fully in hir hert[e] þou?t Abouen alle oþer to maken hir excelle, And of bewte to be þe verray welle. And þer-with-al in schap nor [in] stature Ne was no lak, I dar ?ou wel assure; And God aboue ?af hir souereynte In alle thewes, and wolde sche scholde be Crop &amp; rote namyd of womanhede, With folsomnes of al goodlyhede, So passyngly, þat it wer ydelnes Me to preswme by and by texpresse Hir beute al, it wer a vayn travail; For wel I wote myn englische wolde faile, In whiche mater to talke felyn[g]ly, Who-euere it can, certeyn it am nat I. Þerfore I passe, &amp; stre?t now wil I go To my mater; for Dares of no mo In al his boke maketh mencioun Of hem of Grece nor of Troye toun: In special he putte no mo in mynde Þan ?e haue herde, saue, as ?e schal fynde In þis story, whan it cometh þer-to, Of hir kny?thod &amp; who þat best hath do, Lastyng þe sege, þe maner euerydel. And ri?t anon to scharp[e] my poyntel I wil me dresse, þis story to entrete, Of al þe werre to telle ?ou þe grete. Here folowynge is declarede the grete noumbre of shippes that the Grekys assamblede in the havene of Athenes, bysidis a grete navye that kame to them whene þay wer at Troye. The tyme nei?eþ aftir þis nat ?ore, Þat breme wynter with his frostis hore Gan taswagen of his bitter colde; Whan Appollo passid was þe holde Of þe signe þat we calle Aquarie, And in þe Fissche, fer in Februarie I-ronne was to-ward þe Ariete; And þat sesoun, with his feynt[e] hete, On hillis hi?e gan his bemys smyte, Makyng þe snow with faire flakis whyte In-to water kyndely relente, Whiche from aboue to þe valey went, Þat newe flodis of þe sodeyn þowe Þe grene mede gan to ouerflowe, And þe yis gan stoundemele distille Doun fro þe hil þe brokis for to fille With fomy stremys of þe wawes smale, By broke bankis as þei dide avale; Whan lusty ver, with his ?onge grene, Is recounforted by þe sonne schene, Whiche lite and lite his hewes ay amendeþ, Vp in his spere as Titan vp ascendeth; Whan Marche aprocheþ, &amp; branchis oueral Gynne buddyn out, &amp; þe equinoccial Of wer is halwed, þe sesoun amerous, Whan þe Grekis, proude &amp; coraious, With hool þe flour of her chiualrie Assemblid werne, &amp; holly her navie In þe hauene þat was most of fame, And of Atthenes þat tyme bare the name, Y-gaddred was, by assent echon Towardis Troye to seilen &amp; to gon— So gret [a] noumbre, þat syth þe world began, Is nat remembrid of no maner man, Þat to-gidre in a companye Was met y-fere so passyng a navye Of manly men, who so liste take hede, In þis story as ?e schal after rede. And by and by to make discripcioun, Myn auctor telleth howe Agamenoun, Þe worþi kyng, an hundrid schippis brou?t With worþi kny?tis stuffid as hem ou?t; And Menelaus, on whom lay most [þe] charge, Hath with him brou?t sixti schipes large Out of his londe þat callid is Sparten; And from Boece, ful of manly men, Cam fifty schipes, þe story telleþ þus, With Prothenor and with Archelaus; And from þe lond, callid Sycomenye, Cam xxx.?? schipes in þe companye Of þe duke þat hi?te Achalapus, With whom was eke, ful fresche &amp; desirous, Helymux þe erle, þe worþi kny?t; And fifty schipes, ena[r]med for to fy?t, With him brou?t þe kyng Epistrofus, Only with helpe of kyng Cedyus; And Thelamoun, whom Aiax som men calle, Ful renomed, for to reknen alle, Hath fifty schipes brou?t to þis Iourne From Solemyne, his royal chef cyte, With erlis, dukis, &amp; many worþi kny?t, Eueryche of hem in stele armyd bri?t. And duke Teuter, with Amphiacus, Erl Darion, and noble Theseus— Þis ilke foure, ful worþi of renoun, In þis viage cam with Thelamoun. And olde Nestor, cruel of hert &amp; þou?t, Oute of Pilon haþ fifty schipes brou?t. Þe kyng of Daymes, þat ful worþi was, And eke þe kyng þat hi?t also Thoas Brou?ten with hem in her companye An C schipes kny?tly for to guye; And Thelamoun, y-callid Cilleus, Þat was in armys fel &amp; dispitous, With him brou?t from his londe so ferre Sixe &amp; þritty schipes for þe werre. Amphimacus &amp; kyng Polibete Þritti schipes brou?t[e] to þe flete From Calcedoyne; and Meryoun, þe kyng, Wiþ Ydumeus hadde in her ledyng Foure score schipes with hem oute of Crete; And Vlixes wiþ Grekys dide mete With fifti schipes stuffid oute of Trace, Towardis Troye proudly for to pace. Duke Mellyus, ful of manly men, Brou?t eke [wiþ] hym grete schipes ten; And, ouermore, þe duke Perotacus And þe duke namyd Prothisalus, To þe hauene þat callid was Athene, Brou?t fifty schipes, enarmid bri?t &amp; schene, From Philiarcha, þe strong my?ty Ile. And Methaon, as Guydo doth compile, Wiþ his broþer Polidris also, From her contre Trycianyco, Brou?t xxii?? schipes, as I fynde; And from Phices, as it is made mynde, With Achilles cam fifti ful by noumbre; And from Rodon, Troyens to encombre, Cam xx?? schippis with kyng Thelap[ol]us; And with þe duke þat hi?t Antipus, Oute of þe londe þat Hesida men calle, Of whiche þe folke be ny?e cherlis alle, With sail crossyd ageyn þe bri?t[e] heuene, In noumbre cam schipes eke eleuene; And with hem was, of name ful famus, Þe worþi duke, callid Amphymacus. And Polibethes, þe strong my?ti kyng, Fifty schipis brou?t at his comyng, Oute of Richa, þe noble regioun; And with þis kyng, ful worþi of renoun, Was Losius þe duke, eke as I rede; And, as I fynde, þe noble Diomede, Of schipis grete (I speke of no smal barge) Hath with hym brou?t from Calidoyn &amp; Arge Foure score in noumbre, sothely þis no tale; And Thelemus and my?ti Euryale, Two manly men &amp; in armys sage, Wiþ Diomede cam in þis viage. And Polyphebus brou?t[e] schipis seuene, And Phyneus, þe hardy kyng, enleuene; And Prothoylus, as I can specefie, Brou?t fifty schipis vn-to [t]his navie From Demenesa, þe my?ti regioun; And Carpenor, as made is mencioun, Brou?t fifti eke from Capadie his contre, A gret provynce, of whiche kyng was he. Trearyus, of Beysa lord and kyng, Brou?t xxii?? also in his comyng; And finally, ?if I schal nat lye, Ful many schip was in þis navie— Mo þan Guydo maketh rehersaile, Toward Troye with Grekis for to saile. For as Omer in his discripcioun Of Grekysche schipis makeþ mencioun, Schortly affermyng, þat man was neuer borne Þat swych a noumbre of schippis saw to-forne— Countid þe schipis þat Palamydes Brou?t with hym her noumbre to encrese— Þat whan þese lordis a-forn-seid euerychon, Kynges, dukes, and erlis alle in on Assemblid wern, wiþ-outen any wene, Afore þe hauene þat callid is Athene, Þe famous kyng, grete Agamenoun, So wys, so worþi, &amp; of so hi?e renoun, As he þat was prince and gouernour Of Grekis hoste, anon dide his labour, His besy cure and wakir dilligence, By hi?e avis and inward prouidence To delibre wysly in þis nede What were to do or þat he procede In þis mater, castyng vp and doun And reuoluyng of hi?e discrecioun, Þat he may so begynnen þat þe ende Conclude wel, þat wilfulnes ne schende Holly her purpos þoru? no rakilnes, Ne þoru? noon hast, with-oute avisenes, So þat þei may a-forn so wysely se, Þat finally in felicite Þei may acomplische her purpos in certeyn. And so þis kyng, vp-on a large pleyn, Out of þe cite but litel fro þe stronde, With his lordis wil for no þing wonde To haue a conseil, þis wyse Agamenoun, Makyng a-noon a convocacioun Of swyche as wern most gret in special, He sittyng first in his se royal, And his lordis eueryche in his se, Like as þei wern of hi?e or low degre; And al tumulte stinted, and silence Was þoru? þe pres, to ?if hym audyence, Þanne he anon, in ful sobre wyse, Began his tale, as I schal deuyse. Howe prudently Agamenon coragyde his lordys ageyns the Troyans. “Sirs,” quod he, “I praye ?ou takeþ hede, Þat be so noble and so renomed Boþe of wisdam and of worþines, Of manhode eke and of hi?e prowes, Þat of kny?thod þe report &amp; þe fame Þoru?-oute þe world reboundeþ to ?our name: For dout[e]les þe flour of chiualrie Men may now fynde in þis companye; For who sawe euer of manly men y-fere, To-gidre met, as þer ben now here— So ?onge, so fresche, so coraious also, So wel be-seyn for to haue a-do, Or so likly, sith þe worlde began, With-oute raskaile so many kny?tly man, Of kynges, dukes, and many anoþer lorde, As be now here of wil &amp; on accorde, And of on hert assemblid in þis place, Þat ?if Fortune &amp; goddis, of her grace Be nat be-hinde oure Iourne to apreve, We may nat faille oure purpos to acheve: For, I deme hym pleynly in a rage, Or wers þan wod, þat durste þis viage In any wyse perturben, or preswme To take ageyn vs, ouþer to asswme Be my?t on hym of malys to excite Our worþines—wer it neuer so lyte— Vs to prouoke to Ire, or doon offence, Þat we ne schulde, be mortal recompense, Aquyte his mede, as it liþe in oure my?t, Þat han among vs so many a worþi kny?t— Amongis whiche an hundrid &amp; ?it mo I koude chese able for to go, Be manly force &amp; kny?tly suffysance, To take on hym for to do vengaunce Vp-on Troyans be hym silf allone— For whiche þat we be gadrid now echone— Þat with his meyne were sufficient To execute þe somme of his entent And it acomplische in felicite— Þe cause, I mene, for whiche þat alle we Assemblid ben, boþe hi?e and lowe. And with al þis, to ?ou is nat vnknowe Howe schamefully Troyens han vs grevid, Prouokid vs &amp; wilfully y-mevid To rise ageyn hem to han recur of ri?t Of wrongis don, with al oure force &amp; my?t. Wherfore, lete vs be on assent &amp; wille, Settyn to han, as it is ri?t and skylle, Redres to fynde of þat we now compleyne, And of oon herte done oure besy peyne Vp-on Troyens a werre for to make. And I suppose, we schul hem so a-wake, Þat þei schal lerne, or we þen[ne]s wende, To remembre to þe worldes ende How þei her-after schal dur take on honde For to preswme in Grece more to londe, Or to be bolde while þei haue lif or space Ageyn[es] Grekis more for to trespace: For whos offence, as who seyþe do but late, With-Inne oure herte, with so brennyng hate, Þe feruent hete and þe gredy Ire Fro day to day so settiþ vs a-fire, Þat it reneweþ þe constreynt of oure peyne So inwardly, ?if I schal nat feyne, We mote of resoun of so hi?e greuaunce Our silf enforce for to do vengaunce, As ri?t requireth, and oure iust[e] sorwe Compelleth vs, boþe eve and morwe, On Troyans oure harmes to be-wreke. And for to stop tonges þat so speke To oure repref and to oure vilenye, We most attonys schape remedie, Þat oure foon hen[ne]s-forþe may drede For to do wers to vs, as God forbede, In tyme commyng, ?if þoru? oure pacience We li?tly suffre her importable offence To passe forþe, and take of it noon hede. Sith neuer ?it of Grekis koude I rede, Þat any man dide repref to her name, Þat iustly my?t rebounde to her schame, With-oute þis, þat þei it quitte ageyn Þoru? her manhod, so openly &amp; pleyn, Þat no man my?t of hem seyn or þis In any wyse or report a-mys. Ne we schal nat dissymulen in þis cas, With cher oppressed, nor with dredful face To lete slyde or li?tly ouer-go Þe grete offencis þat were so late do, Whiche wolde turne vn-to vs and ours To gret reprefe, &amp; to oure successoures In tyme comyng, &amp; schamefully be spoke, How þat Grekis durste nat be wroke Vp-on her foon—þe whiche may nat be, I ?ou ensure, sith þat alle we Ben of oon wil to reforme oure wrong, And þer-with-al so my?ty &amp; so strong, Þat who is he þat koude in brede &amp; lengþe A-ri?t reherse our power &amp; our strengþe, Or who durste euer oure worþines assaile Þat he ne schulde, with-oute any faile, Repente in hert, or at þe ende rewe— Saue Troyans, þis oþer day of newe, Of wilfulnes, in a foly rage In-to oure londe maden a viage, Vnwar of vs, &amp; with her praye hom went; Þe whiche þei schal ful hastily repent, For her trespas and gret offencioun: For al þe worlde knoweþ vp and doun, But late agon how Grekis but a fewe Vp-on Troyens her power dide schewe And slowe her kyng, callid Lamedoun, Fadir to Priam, now kyng of þat toun, And fordide touris and cite, And with hem ladde in captiuite, From Grekis swerde swiche as hem list spare, Þat among vs in seruitude and care Compleyne her harme whiche may nat be recurid. Þan how may þei stonde full assured Ageyn vs alle to holden chaumpartye, Þat han so worþi in oure companye; For it is likly a þousand to acheue Þat four or five so li?tly my?t[e] preue. And ?it o þing aferme wel I dar, Of oure comyng Troyens ar wel war And don her labour &amp; her dilligence Ageyn[e]s vs to make resistence With al her my?t—I knowe it oute of doute— And gadre frendis in contres al aboute To helpen hem &amp; strengþe hem in her nede, Vs to wiþstonde, ?if þei my?t[e] spede. But finally, o þing I consaille, From þis hauene or we ferþer saille, Þat we may be þe more fortunat, Of oon assent to make ambassiat, And prudently, or we ferþer wende, In-to Delos in al hast þat we sende— Whiche is an yle a litel here be-syde— More discretly our Iourne to provide, Þat we may han þe better hap &amp; grace Of Appollo, patroun of þat place— To haue of hym, ?if þat we may spede, Fynal answer in þis grete nede Of oure expleyt how þat it schal falle, ?if it so be ?e wil assenten alle To þis conseil, þe meste and eke þe leste.” And þei echon þou?ten for þe beste To condiscende to þis conclusioun With-outen any contradiccioun; And alle attonys, with-outen any drede, Þei prayse his counseil &amp; his wyse rede; And þer-vp-on, discretly, as þei ou?te, As seiþe þe stori, euene þus þei wrou?t. Howe Agamenon, by þe avyce of al þe princes of Grece, sent Achilles and Pirodus into Delphos, to haue answere of Apollo, whidere thay shulde haue þe victory of þe Troyens or no. And here-aftire is declarid, howe ydolatrye and fals godes had ther bygynnenge; And how Calchas kam to þe same Ille. After þe tyme þat Agamenoun Concludid haþ fully his resoun, As ?e han herde, &amp; his sentence fyned, Þe Grekis ben of herte ful enclined, And with o vois acordid pleynly þus, Þat Achilles and also Pirrodus, For comoun profit, sith[en] þei wer sage, Schal take on hem þe charge of þis message, To Appollo for answere for to goon; And to schip þei hem haste anoon And seile furþe be þe large se Toward Delphos, and in prosperite Þei ben aryued &amp; I-com to londe. Þe whiche Ile, as I vndirstonde, And as myn auctor seith, with-oute les, Haueth his syyt amonge[s] Cyclades, Wher men with rokkis haue so moche a-do, Amyd þe see callid Elespontico. Of whiche Ile to make discripcioun, I mote a while make digressioun Fro my mater, as myn auctor doth; For in þis Ile, Ysidorus in soth Reherseþ pleynly how Latona, þe quene, Appollo firste, and Diane þe schene I-childid haþe, by Iubiter her lord, Whan he and Iuno wer[e]n at discord— As writ Ovide—for a litel while. And so by-fil, in þis litel Ile Þer was a temple whilom dedicat Vn-to Appollo, and also consecrat In his worschipe, of olde fundacioun, Þat was honoured with grete deuocioun, Be-cause Appollo with his bemys clere, After þe flood, firste þere dide appere To schewe his hornys, raþer þere &amp; sone, And Diane eke, þat callid is þe mone. Of whiche schewyng þis Ile bereþ þe name In-to þis day, þat is of so grete fame— Only be aperyng of þis ilke tweyne: For Delos is in Greke no more to seyne Þan a schewyng or an apparence. And þus be-gan þe grete reuerence To Appollo first, and þe honour eke To hym y-do of so many Greke, And to his suster þat callid is Dyane, Þe pale mone, þat can so wexe and wane, And callid is of paynymys a goddesse, Þat whilom was in wode an hunteresse. And þis lady, with þe sonne her broþer, Of þis Ile haue lordschip &amp; non oþer, Only for þei at her natiuite Schewid her li?t firste in þat contre. Þe whiche Ile Grekis also calle Ortigia, in her language alle, Be-cause curlews wer þer first I-seyn: For Ortigias is no more to seyn Þan a curlew, in grew, I vndirstonde; For þei were firste engendrid in þat londe. And Appollo is callid eke Tytan, Þat in his tyme so moche worschip wan, Longe to-forne or he was made a sterre, With Iubiter whan þat he hilde werre. And he also y-callyd is Phebus, And of somme y-namyd Phicius: For of Pheton he hadde þe victorie Whan he him slow?, to his encres of glorie— Þe grete serpent here in erþe lowe— Wiþ his arwis and his my?ti bowe. Of whiche conquest þe gret[e] god Cupide Had envie, and euene þoru? þe syde He woundid hym, depe to þe herte With þe arwe of golde, þat made him sore smerte. And of Pheton, þat Phebus made fyne, Com Phetonysses, þat konne so devine— I mene women þat ben devyneresses Þoru? dede men, þis false sorceresses, As oon whilom reisede Samuel For loue of Saule, þe Byble can ?ou telle. And in his temple large, longe, and olde, Þer was a statue al of purid golde, Ful gret and hi?e, &amp; of huge wei?te, And þer-in was, þoru? þe deuels slei?te, A spirit vnclene, be false illusioun, Þat ?af answere to euery questioun— Nat þe ydole, dovmbe as stok or stoon. And þus þe peple, deceyued euerychon, Were by þe fend brou?t in gret errour, To done worschip &amp; swyche false honour, With sacrifise &amp; cursed mawmentrie. And in þis wyse began ydolatrie, As in þis place to tellen I me caste, And how longe it abode and laste, Compendiously I purpose to discryve— Gynnyng &amp; ende, as ?e schal here blyve, Wiþ-outen any ambyguite. For at þe birþe and natiuite Of Crist Iesu, at þe incarnacioun, Alle þe ydoles brast and fel[le] doun, And vanisched, &amp; wer brou?t to nou?t, Whan Herodes þe blisful childe haþ sou?t Þoru? his malis &amp; cruelte horrible, As holy writ recordeþ &amp; þe Bible. For whiche pursut and persecucioun, Þer dide apere, be a visioun, An holy angel to Ioseph as he slep, And bad hym ryse &amp; also taken kep Vn-to þe childe, and also to Marie, And goon his way, or Herode him espye, In-to Egypt, þe grete regioun, Lik as þe gospel makeþ mencioun. And ri?t anoon, as he cam to londe, Þer was non ydole vp-ri?t my?t[e] stonde, But to-schiuerede vn-to pecis smale— Þis holy writ, pleinly, and no tale, As was recorded first of Isaie, How þat oure lorde on an esy skye Ascende schulde &amp; holde furþe his weye Toward Egypt, &amp; þer-wiþ schulde deye Al mawmetrie, and no lenger duelle. But as þe Iewes recorde of Ysmael, Þat he was first þat mawmetrie fonde, And made of clay an ydole with his honde, And as peynymys write &amp; tellen vs Þat aldirfirst was Promotheus Þat fond ydolis, schortly to conclude; For simulacrum cometh of similitude— Þat is no þing pleynly but liknes Made after man, his ymage to expresse, Vn-to whiche paynymys in her guyse, With false honour &amp; cursyd sacrifise, Be-gonne first þis ryt for drede of man. And somme seyn, how Belus first began Swiche fals[e] worschip &amp; suche mawmetrie, In her bokis as clerkis specefie, Þat of Assirie was lord &amp; gouernour, After whos deth his sone in his honour, Þat Nynus hi?t, an ymage dide make To be worschipte only for his sake— Al of brent gold, be fals affeccioun, And sette it vp for consolacioun, And for a mynde and a memorial, Vn-to þe whiche, with hert[e], wil, and al, Of ygnoraunce and of fleschly love He dide honour, as to God above, In his templis, most of excellence, And made his peple to do reuerence, And seide in heuene he was deified, Þat of no man durst[e] be denyed. Til after sone but a lytel whyle, A wickid spirit, folkis to be-gyle, In þis ydole entrid to abyde, And ?af answer vp-on euery side To þe peple of what him list demaunde; And þei ageyn, what he wil commaunde Obeye fully—þe folke of al Assirie— Whiche vn-to God dide gret Iniurie, Makyng þe peple in suche errour falle. And somme Belus &amp; somme Bel hym calle, And somme Balym &amp; somme Belphegor, And fil in errour alwey more &amp; more— And Bel?ebub he named was also, Whiche name is made of wordis two: Of Bel &amp; ?ebub, þat þus signefie— For Bel is god, and ?ebub is a flye— Þan Bel?ebub to-gidre specefies, Ioyned in on, þe grete god of flyes. And of þis feyned fals ydolatrie Gan al þe worlde worschip mawmetrie; For somme Satorn “god of goddis alle” Gan in her errour falsly for to calle, Þat was whilom þe my?ti kyng of Crete, And ?af hym name after þe planete Þat in heuene haþ so large a spere. And as poetis in her fablis lere, Þat he be-forn, þoru? his sapience, Sawe in his dyvyne providence Howe a sone schulde of hym discende, And of Iuno þe goddesse, as he wende, Þat schulde hym pleinly from his regne expelle And suffren him no lenger for to duelle In his kyngdam, whan he com to age— Wher-of Satorn fil in swiche a rage, Þat he wil schape remedie þer-fore, Byddyng his wyf, þat whan þe childe wer bore Þat sche to hym schulde it bring a-noon, In stede wher-of to hym sche brou?t a ston— To saue hir chylde sche dide hir besynes— And þis Satorn, þoru? his gredynes, Þe ston deuoureþ in his malencolye. And þus Satorn, but ?if bokis lye, Hadde sonys þre, a dou?ter, &amp; no mo: Iubiter, Neptunus, and Pluto. But Iubiter grattest was of name, Most renomed &amp; worþiest of fame Among paynyms, as it is verefied; For þei so hi?e han hym magnyfied, Þat þei hym calle “god of fire &amp; eyr,” Nexte to Satorne borne for to be heyr. And nexte to hym, in bokis as I rede, Is god of bataille, my?ti Mars þe rede; And nexte Appollo, so cler, so schene &amp; bri?t, Þe daies eye &amp; voider of þe ny?t, Cherischer of frut, of herbe, flour, &amp; corne— Þe whiche god, liche as is seid a-forne, In Delos is worschipte and honoured. And after, Venus, þat often haþ socoured Many louere, þe faire, lusty quene, And hem alleggid of hir woundis grene, Þat first were hurt with hir fyry brond, As sche þat is goddes of many lond, And al þe worlde haþe in hir demeyne Fast enbracid in hir firy cheyne— I mene þe lady þat callid is Venus. And nexte in ordre is Mercuryus, Þat in speche hath most excellence Of rethorik and sugrid elloquence; Of musik, songe, and of armonye He hath lordschipe and hool þe regalye. Nexte þe mone, þat wexe can &amp; wane, Callid Lucyna and also eke Dyane, Þat in Delos hath hir mansioun, Lik as to-forn is maked mencioun— Now ful of li?t, now hornyd pale is sche, Lady of chaunge and mutabilite, Þat selde in on halt hir any tyme; And so fare þei þat ben born in hir clyme, Þat ay delite in þingis þat ben newe, Whos hert is clad in many sondry hewe, So þei be diuers in her affecciouns. And in þis wyse, in sondri regiouns, Of mawmetrie is þe venym ronne, Lik as clerkis wel deuyse konne: For, as I fynde, þe Mawricyens Worschip Iulam, and Egypciens Honouren Ysis, after her konnyng, Whilom dou?ter of Ynachus þe kyng, Þat tau?t hem first hir lond to ere &amp; sowe, And also lettris for to rede and knowe, And in lettrure to sette her besynes— For whiche þing þei calle hir a goddes. And Iubiter honoured is in Crete, Where he whilom hilde his souereyn sete, And on hem leyde many diuers charge, With egles betyn in his baner large; And he was lord of eyr, of lond, &amp; see, His royal kyngdam deuidyng in-to þre: In þe hiest hym silfe doth contune, And hool þe se he ?af vn-to Neptune, And laste þe erþe, to holde his se royal, He ?af to Pluto, þat god is infernal; And alderlast, whan he was stellified, Þis Iubiter was moste magnified Of hem of Crete, a-bouten ouer al, To whom þei made for a memorial A large tombe and a statue a-lofte, And hym honoured in her ritis ofte With encens and oþer sacrifice. And of þis mater ferþer to deuise, Þe Latynys wiþ besy dilligence In her rytis dide reuerence To þe goddis—?if it be credible— I-callid fawny, þat ben Invisible, And han her duellyng in þe wodis grene, Al-be þat men her figure may nat sene. And of Romeyns ferþer to devine, Þei most in honour han hir god Quyryne, Þe whiche whilom, as bokis tellen vs, Amongis hem was callid Romulus, Þat bilt[e] first þe wallis of þe toun; And from an hirde he cam to swiche renoun Þoru? his manhod &amp; his worþines. Þe spere of whom, as bokis seyn expresse, As he þe hed picched in þe grounde, It gan anon, lik as it is founde, To florische &amp; floure &amp; buddyn by myracle, And of nature had[de] noon obstacle To wexe grene with fresche blomys newe. And for þe manhod þat men in hym knewe, For his kny?thod and his grete fame, Þe worþi kny?tes of Rome bare þe name After hym, &amp; were querytes callid, Hi?e in heuene whan þat he was stallid Amonge þe goddis, and y-deifyed. And þus Romeyns han hym glorified, As for her god, with gold &amp; gret expencis. And, as I rede, þe Athenyenses Of hool[e] herte chosen for to serue To þe goddes þat callid is Mynerue, And Pallas eke, wiþ hir cristal schelde, Þat with Neptunus evene amyd þe felde Helde chaumpartye, with wommen on hir syde; And he with men, ful sirquedous in pride, Defendiþ hym for ?eving of þe name Of Athenes, a cite most of fame— Þis to seyn, wheþer he or sche Schulde of ri?t name þe cite— Til it be-fil, as þei gonne stryue, Sodeynly þer sprang a fair olyue For Pallas part, grene &amp; fair blosmyng, And þer ageyn, a welle gan to springe For hym Pluto, with water, large &amp; depe, Of whiche þing Appollo toke good kepe, Whiche in his dom was nat rek[e]les; And for þe olyve tokeneþ loue &amp; pes, Water trouble, contek, werre, and strif, He ?af sentence anon diffynytif, How Pallas schulde, þat callid is Mynerve, Þe palme pleynly of þis strif disserue. And sche anon ?af name to þe toun, And callid it, be hi?e discrecioun, Athenes, þe whiche in special Is to seyn, a cite in-mortal: For wisdam first þer be-gan to floure. And for þis skille, þis cite dide honour Mi?ty Pallas, goddesse of science, And had hir ay moste in reuerence. And þei of Pave, in al her regioun, Worschip moste þe quene of Cytheroun— I mene Venus, ful of doubilnes, Of whom aforne somwhat I dide expresse— And in hir temple, ful solempnely, Þei sette hir hiest; &amp; moste richely With gold and a?ure hir statue þei do peint, And oþer colours þat may neuer feynt, And set hir vp in þe hi?est se Of all þe temple þat al men may se; And sche stant nakid in a wawy se, Abouten hir with goddesse þre, Þat be assygned with besy attendaunce To a-waite on hir &amp; don hir obseruaunce. And floures fresche, blewe, rede, and white Ben hir aboute, þe more for to delyte; And on hir hed sche haþ a chap[e]let Of rosys rede, ful plesauntly y-set, And from þe hed doun vn-to hir foot With sondry gommys &amp; oynementis soot Sche is enoynt, swetter for to smelle; And enviroun, as poetis telle, Ben douvys whyte fleyng, &amp; eke sparwis, And be-syde Cupide with his arwys— Hir blinde sone—for to hurte and dere, And loseth ofte &amp; smyt he wot not where, As he mote nede, be-cause he is blynde. And þus honouryd &amp; most had in mynde Amonge þis peple is Venus þe goddesse. And Naxyens don her besynesse To serue Bachus, þe my?ti god of wyn, Whos licour is moste precious and fyn To recomfort hertis and to glade, And to refresche hewes þat ben fade In facis pale, and makiþ wittis scharp, Losnyth tongis, &amp; doth hem loude carp, And causeth hem to walke at liberte, And to discure þing þat was secre Wiþ-oute avys or discrecioun: For w[h]er as wyn hath domynacioun, No secrenesse may be kepte in mewe. And somme of hem þat Bachus serue &amp; sewe, Amonge to hym haue swiche deuocioun Þat þei som while ar voide of al resoun, Hasty and wood, &amp; wiþ-oute al drede; And somme also so toty in her hede Þat þei are voide of power &amp; of my?t, And haue no foot for to stonde vp-ri?t. And ?it þei ben as chargaunt as a pye, Pale cherid, wiþ a glasy eye, Ful of resoun til his wynde be spent: For man or woman þat is vinolent Is verreyly a beste vnresonable, And, to my dom, I holde hym eke vnable To ben acceptid in any companye, Whan þat her tonge wadeth on þe lye, Þat þei ne may brynge forth a worde. And þus Bachus, þe stronge my?ty lorde, Ful ofte causeth folkis for to erre, To debate, &amp; to make werre Of hastynes, wher as is no nede. Wherfore it is wisdam þat men drede His sli?ty werkyng, or þei falle in þe snare; And feble braynys be mesour for to spare Or þei vnwarly arestid ben &amp; take, And or Bachus make hem for to schake In a fevere wers þan tercyen— ?iffe it of custom be quotidien, Alterat with Bachus my?ty Iows— And afferde of tornyng of þe hous, And for-dreynt on þe drye lond, Whan he hath lost boþe foot &amp; hond, And with a strawe pleyeth like an ape, And deuoutly gynneth for to gape, And noddeth ofte with his Iowsy hed, As he had on an hevy cappe of led. And who þat be of þis condicioun, He entre may þe religioun Of my?ti Bachus, for abilite. Þe which[e] lord hath þe souereynte Boþe of hony and of mylke þer-to, And of bawme, þat is so riche also, And lordschip haþe of hi?e power devyne Boþe of grapis and of euery vyne, To ?if hem norissching by his influence. Of whom þe honour and þe reuerence Is reysed most, as I vndirstond, Among wynteris in euery maner lond, Be-cause he is to hem so gracious. And þei of Lewne worschip Wlcanus, Þe god of fyre, Iubiter[i]s smyth; Þe whiche forgiþ on his blak[e] stith Þe gret[e] þonder, hidous &amp; horrible, And þe levenys, þat whilom be visible In-to þe west, oute of þe orient, And gasteth vs with his dredeful dent— Þis smotry smyth, þis swart[e] Vlcanus, Þat whylom was in herte so Ialous Toward Venus, þat was his weddid wyf, Wher-of þer roos a dedly mortal stryfe Whan he with Mars gan hir first espie, Of hi?e malis &amp; cruel fals envie, Þoru? þe schynyng of Phebus bemys bri?t, Liggyng a-bedde with Mars her owne kny?t. For whiche in hert he brent as any glede, Makyng þe sklaundre al abrood to sprede, And gan þer-on falsly for to mwse— As God forbede þat any man accuse For so litel any woman euere: Where loue is set, hard is to disseuere; For þou? þei don swyche þing of gentilles, Passe ouere li?tly and bere noon hevines Liste þat þou be to wommen odyous— And ?it þis smy?t, þis false Wlcanus, Al-be þat he hadde hem þus espied, Among peynyms ?it was he deified; And for þat he so falsely hem a-woke, I haue hym set laste of al my boke Amonge þe goddis of fals mawmetrie. And in þis wyse gan ydolatrie, As ?e han herde, þoru? oppiniouns Of peple erryng in her affecciouns— Þat al is fals, who þe trouthe cerche: For by techyng of al holy chirche, Þe holy doctryne and tradiciouns, We schal dispise swiche oppiniouns, Whiche of þe fende wer founde nat of late. For whan angelis in hevene wer create, He þat of alle hadde prelacye— Of whom þe prophete callid Ysaie Writeþ ri?t þus: how þe cedris grene Of paradys wer nat so fair to sene, Planys nor fir in hei?te, soþe to seyn, To his hi?nesse my?t[e] nat atteyne, Nor al þe tres, so delicio?s, Of paradys were nat so precio?s, Nouþer in si?t nor in semlynes To ben egal to hym in fairnes; But þo[r]u? his pride &amp; his surquedie, Whan he seide to God, þat sit so hi?e, He wil be like, and also set his se Hi?e in þe northe, passyng his degre, He was cast doun with alle his legiouns From þe faire hevenly mansiouns, Al sodeynly in-to þe pitte of helle, Perpetuely þer for to duelle. Of whom was seide, whan he fil so ferre: “How fil þou so, o þou morwe sterre, From þe myddis of þe stonys bri?t, Þat ben so percynge &amp; fyry of her li?t, Þat whilom wer for þi gret bri?tnes Callid Lucyfer,”—of whom Crist seiþ expresse In his gospel, how he sawe fro hevene Sathan discende, lik þe fyry leuene— Þe olde serpent, þat is so lowe falle, Whom Hebrei in her tonge [c]alle Be-mowþe, þat doth in latyn plein expresse A beste rude, ful of cursednesse— Þe vile serpent, he, Leuyathan, Whom Ysidre wel discriue can, Whiche of kynde is euere conuersaunt In wellis trouble, &amp; haueþ most his haunt Amongis watris in þe large see; Of whom seiþ Dauid, lik as ?e may se, In þe sauter makyng mencioun Of þe snake, þe monstruous dragoun, Ful of venym, and of harde grace, Whiche in þe se, large &amp; gret of space, With foule addris haþe his mansioun, Vn-to mankynde to doon illusioun— Whom whilom sawe þe holy monke Brandan, As he seiled by þe occian, Þrowe &amp; deiect, in a pet horrible, More foule and hidous þan it is credible, Þer to abide, þis tortuose serpent, Vn-to þe day pleinly of Iugement, Þat of malis envied so mankynde. Whiche with his gynnes &amp; slei?tes, as I finde, Cam to oure fadir first in paradys; And to deceyve þe bet at his devys, More couertly, þis werme in his passage Toke of a serpent þe liknes &amp; ymage— Þat is, of chere, of loke, and countenaunce Like a mayde, &amp; hath þe resemblaunce Of a womman, as recordeth Bede, In his deceytis raþer for to spede— I mene þe hed only, and nat ellis: For be-hynde, so as clerkis tellis, Like a serpent of wombe, bak, &amp; taile He was whan he gan hem to assaile; And towarde Eue whan he gan to glide, He first enqueriþ, as he hir toke a-side, Why God for-bad hem etyn of þe tree, Whiche ?if þei ete, sothly schulde be Like to goddis, knowyng good &amp; ille. And ri?t furþe-with, as þei gan fullfille Þe fendis heste, her eyen were vnclosid, And for her gilt sodeynly deposid From paradys in-to wrechidnes, To liuen in labour, sorwen, &amp; distres. And þus þe fend, first whan þat he toke Forme of a snake &amp; a woman loke, And made þe tonge in hir hed to meve, By fals engyn mankynde for to greve, So as he doth in hem þat be travailled, With wicked spirites vexid &amp; assailled, To meve her tongis falsly oute to breke In-to blasfemye, what þing þat þei speke— Þe same serpent, he Levyathan, Contynvyng ay falsly as he gan In cursid ydoles dovmbe, defe, &amp; blynde, Ful ofte spekith be spirites, as I fynde, Whiche ar but fendis, Dauid writ certeyn, Þe goddis alle, whom folkis so in veyn Honour with ritis superstycious, As whilom was Appollo Delphicus, Liche as to-forn ?e han herde deuise, Whiche as for now ou?te I-now? suffise. And, as I trowe, þe verray cause why, Þat myn auctor rehersith by and by Grounde &amp; gynnynge of ydolatrie— Þis þe cause, for ou?t I can espie, For þat he sawe þe mater was nat knowe I-liche wel, boþe to hi?e and lowe; Par aventure ?ou to do plesaunce, He hath þe grounde put in remembraunce Of false goddis &amp; of mawmetrie, And moste for hem þat can no poisye, And to þe story resorteþ sone ageyn, How Achilles, as ?e han herde me seyn, And Pirrodus han þe weye y-nome To þe temple, and þider ben I-come To han answere of her embassatrie, Of gret Appollo, whiche may nat lye. Of the answere that Appollo gave, as welle to fals Bisshope Calchas, as to Achylles. Of þe prestis þei han her counseil take, In þe temple to preyen and to wake Til þei may fynde, vn-to þere entent To haue answere at hour conuenient To her purpos and leiser opportune. And of on herte so longe þei contune In praying, fastynge, and oblacions, Wiþ sacrifyse and sondry orisons, To-fore þe god awayting alwey faste, Til he to hem answerid at þe laste Wiþ softe vois and seide: “Achilles,” twye, “Home to Grekis fast[e] þat þou hye, Fro whom þou were hidir to me sent, And seye hem sothly þe somme of her entent Schal be fulfilled, with-oute wordis mo, And how þat þei schal to Troye go, And þer abide many stronge bataille, But at þe last, with-outen any faille, At ten ?ere day, þei wynne schal þe toun And bringe it pleynly to distruccioun— Wal and touris schal falle to ruyne; And with al þis, her purpos for to fyne, Kyng Priamus and Eccuba his wyf And her sonys, in þis mortal stryf Schal þer be slayn, broþer after broþer: Þis is þe fyn, for it may be non oþer; For þer schal non eskapen in þe place, But swiche as Grekis likeþ vn-to grace Of verray rouþe and of mercy take— Þis al and som, &amp; þus an ende I make.” Of whiche answere Achilles glad &amp; li?t Was in his herte, &amp; with al his my?t Þankiþ Appollo of þis blisful ewer; And soudeynly, of sort or aventure, Þe silfe tyme be-fil a wonder þing: For out of Troye, fro Priamus þe kyng, Was sent a bischop for þe same caas To haue answere, whos name was Calchas. And he cam in, sool wiþ-outen prees, Þe same hour while þat Achilles Was þer present, a man of gret science— I mene Calchas—&amp; had experience Specyally of calculacioun, Of sort also and divinacioun, And lernyd was in astronomye. And whan þat he his tyme dide espie To haue answere most conuenyent Of Appollo, like to his entent, As to-fore makid is memorie, He entrid is in þe oratorie, Doyng his ritys &amp; his obseruances, Like þe custom with þe circumstaunces, And besely gan to knele and praye, And his þinges deuoutly for to saye, And to þe god crie &amp; calle stronge; And for Appollo wolde him nat prolonge, Sodeynly his answere gan atame, And seide: “Calchas,” twies be his name, “Be ri?t wel war þat þou ne turne ageyn To Troye toun, for þat wer but in veyn; For finally, lerne þis of me, In schort tyme it schal distroyed be— Þis is in soth, whiche may nat be denyed, Wherfor I wil þat þou be allyed Wiþ þe Grekis, and with Achilles go To hem anon; my wil is it be so: For þei schal han, as I haue disposid, Victorie &amp; honour, þat may nat be deposid; For it is fatal and ne may nat varie, And þou to hem schalt be necessarie In conseillyng and in ?evinge red, And be ri?t helpyng to her good[e] sped.” And with þat worde roos him vp Calchas, And to Achilles he went an esy pace, And whan þat he cam to his presence, With gret honour &amp; moche reuerence He was reseyuyd, like to his estat; And after sone þei [were] confederat, Swor to-gidre be bonde &amp; assuraunce To ben al on, wiþ-oute variaunce; And þanne in hast þei to-gidre goon To her schipes, &amp; schope hem furþe anon, With Pirrodus goyng by her syde. Þei hale vp anker and no lenger bide, But seile furþe, Calchas &amp; þei tweyne, Toward Grece—hem nedeth nat compleine On wynde nor wawe—til þei arived be At Athenes, þat stood vp-on þe se, A large cite of olde fundacioun; And Achilles to kyng Agamenoun Hath Calchas brou?t and also Pirrodus. And whan þe Grekis, þe story telliþ vs, Assemblid wern, þei to-gidre wente To-fore þe kyng, &amp; Calchas represente To alle þe lordis, and no lenger dwelle. And ri?t anoon Achilles gan to telle With-oute abood, in Delos how þei mette To-fore Appollo, where þei answer fette, And how þe god hath pleinly determyned Þe Grekis purpos, how it schal be fyned Vp-on Troyens, and bad Calchas also In no wyse þat he to Troye go, But wiþ Grekis þat he abide stille, Til þei her purpos fynally fulfille. Of whiche þing þe Grekis, glad of chere, Calchas accepte with herte ful entere For on of hem, confederat be bonde, To ben al on on water &amp; on londe, Wiþ-outen chaunge or any variance— Þe oþe is made &amp; put in remembraunce; And þei ageyn fully hym assure To cherisschen hym whil her lif may dure, For wel or wo, and so þei made an ende, And after parte &amp; to her loggyng wende. Til on þe morwe, after þe sterry ny?t, Whan Aurora was gladid with þe li?t Of Phebus bemys, þe Grekis vp aryse, And to her goddis with many sacrifice Þei don honour in what þei can or may, And deuoutly holdyng a feste day, After her ritis, meynt with love &amp; drede, In remembraunce of þe good[e] spede, And of þe answer þat gooddis han hem sent, So agreable vn-to her entent, By Pirrodus and by Achilles. And aftir þis, amongis alle þe prees, Is Calchas come to-fore Agamenoun, Alle his lordis sittyng enviroun Lik her estatis, eche in his place dewe, And humblely gan hem to salue Vp-on his knees with sobre contenaunce, And prayde hem, it be no displesance To stynt a while and ?if hym audience. And ri?t anoon, as makid was silence Amonge hem alle, Calchas gan abreide, And euene þus ful sobirly he seide: How fals Calchas of Troy was conveyede to þe presences of þe prinses of Grece, and howe he innaturelly exortyde them to make mortal were vpon his kynge and kynrede, as folowith. “O sirs,” quod he, “and my lordis dere, Kynges, princes, &amp; dukis þat ben here, So noble echon, worþi, and famus, And eke so manly and so vertuus, Which in þis place be now here present, Is nat þe fyn &amp; chef of [?]oure entent, And cause, also, why þat ?e echon Assemblid ben to Troye for to goon Wiþ þis power and þis grete strengþe— Your purpos is to longe drawe a lengþe And differrid furthe fro day to day To ?our damage, platly þis no nay; For to longe ?e soiowre in þis Ile.

Wherfore I rede, hen[ne]s þat ?e passe, And schapeþ ?ou no lenger to lyn here, But whil þe wedir is so fair &amp; clere, And lusty somer abideþ in his hete Or wynter com with his reynys wete, And whil þe sesoun is so fresche &amp; grene (I speke of hert, platly as I mene) For ?our expleit and ?our alder ese (Wher it so be, I anger ?ou or plese) Þat forþe in haste to schip[pe] þat ?e wende— I can no more, my tale is at an ende.” And alle attonys þei ben condescendid To his avis, &amp; han it wel commendid; And in al hast, Agamenoun þe grete— Þe lusty tyme and þe sesoun swete Hastyng þe Grekis, boþen hi?e &amp; lowe— Made a trompet to schipward to blowe; And þei echon his biddyng dide obeie, And to her schippes þei goon þe ri?t[e] weye With-oute abood—þei wil no lenger dwelle. What schulde I more of þe noumbre telle Of her schippis, sith ?e han herde a-fore?— It nedeth nat reherse it any more; I can nat se what it my?t availe. But furþe þei dresse hem &amp; be-gan to saile; And þis is soth, pleynly &amp; no wene, So gret a navie was neuer ?it y-sene In al þis worlde, ne to-gider met. Þe wynde was good, þat þei wer nat let On her weye first whan þei be-gonne; But after sone gan þe schene sonne Þe clerenes chaunge of his bri?t[e] face; And dymme cloudis gan his li?t embrace; And sodeynly, in ful owgly wyse, Þe heuen dirke &amp; þe wynde gan ryse; Þe hidous þonder &amp; þe leuene clere Smet in þe mast, bri?t as any fere; And þe blaknes of þe smoky rayn Blindeth þe eyr, þat no þing may be seyn; And þe wawes gan to ryse a-lofte, And in her schippes falle no þing softe, But plounge a-doun and in her toppis smyte, Þat hem þou?t þei want[e] but a lite To haue be ded, in þe silfe stounde: Til Calchas hath by his crafte y-founde Þe cause of al, [and] with his orisouns, Wiþ his charmys and incantac[i]ouns Made sodeynly þe tempest to apese, And with his crafte don hem ri?t gret ese. For he fonde oute þe cause of euerydel, How Diane liked no þing wel Þat þe Grekis durst[e] take on honde To be [so] bolde to parte fro þe stronde In-to þe se, in any maner wyse, And do to hir no maner sacrifise, Nouþer offre to-forn or þat þei goth: For whiche þing þe goddes is so wroth Toward Grekis, seyling in þe se, Þat þei echon wend haue drownyd be. Til at þe last, kyng Agamenoun Hath be counseil and informacioun Of wyse Calchas made sette vp to londe, In-to an Ile, and fast his schippes bonde. And Aulides þat litel Ile hi?te, In whiche he fonde vnwarly in his si?te A litel temple and an oratorie, Founded of olde &amp; made in memorie Of Diane, to whiche anoon he wente Ful deuoutly his offeryng to presente, And quemyd hir with his oblaciouns, And lay þer long in his orisouns, After þe rytis vsid in his lawe, Til þat he sawe þe tempest gan a-dawe. But some bokis make mencioun Touching þis þing, þat Agamenoun, As Ovide reherseth in his boke,— How þis kyng his owne dou?ter toke, Effigenya, benigne of face and chere, And endelong vppon þe autere Þis maide he laide, dispoiled of her wede, To-fore Dyane to maken hir to blede, To fyn only þat he þe heuenly quene With blood þat was Innocent &amp; clene Apese my?t, and quemen of hir rage. And þe goddes gracius of visage Hath mercy meint with hir magnificence, To suffre a maide ful of Innocence Gilt[e]les in her temple slawe, Hath be miracle a-waye hir body drawe, And conservid from al anoye &amp; smerte, And in hir stede vnwarly cast an herte, By deth of whom, as bokys make mynde, Agamenoun first gan grace fynde In þe goddes for to modyfye Hir cruel Ire: and clere gan þe skye, Þe se wexe calme, and þe wedir fair; And Phebus eke, to glade with þe eyr, Gan schewe newe, &amp; his bemys cast In-to þe se; and þe kyng as fast Vn-to schip repeired is a-geyn, Þoru? help of hir which is, as clerkis seyn, Lady &amp; quene of wayes and passage; And goddes is callid of viage, After sentence and oppinioun Of hem þat werke be calculacioun, And ?eue her domys by astronomye. And most of al þei hir magnifye In þe tenþe and þe twelþe house; For þer sche is, þei sei, most gracious, Best fortuned, cler or in hir schade, ?if sche haue counfort of aspectis glade Of planetis stondyng in good state— I mene swiche as be fortunat To viage or Iourne for to make. Howe the Grekis destroyede the Castel callede Sarabona as þey saylede towarde Troye, and it dispoylede. And swiche tyme Agamenoun hath take His happy weye schipped for to be; And in good hour he taken haþe þe se With þe Grekis, þe wedir agreable; And Eolus hath maked acceptable Wynde and eyr, hoolly at her wylle, Nouþer to loude, pleynly, nor to stille, But in a mene so merie made blowe, Þat þei atteyn, in a litel þrowe, To certeyn boundis of Troye þe cite, Vn-to a castel, þat stood vp-on þe se, Ri?t wonder strong, þou? it wer but lite, Þe name of whiche, þou? Dares not ne write— I mene Dares callyd Frigyus— ?et oþer auctours rehersen sothly þus, Sarobona þat it was y-callid, Rounde aboute diched &amp; wel wallid, With hi?e touris rounde, square, and wyde; Þe se went vnder, and faste þer be-side Was an hauene able for ryvaille. At whiche, pleinly, þe Grekis wil nat faile With her power my?tely to aryve, Maugre alle þo þat þer ageyn[es] stryue— Þei my?t[e] wel, for it was nat denyed, Only excepte þat þei wer espied Of hem allone þat in þe castel dwelle. Þe whiche anoon, as þei herde telle Of her commyng, proudly in þe berde With hem to mete were no þing a-ferde, But issen oute, doun vn-to þe stronde, In purpos only to letten hem for to londe With al her my?t, ?if it wolde availle. But þe Grekis so proudly hem assaille Þat þei ne my?t in her diffence endure: For wher-as þei wendyn haue be sure, Demyng þe Grekis pleinly of þe se Forweried and feynted hadde be, Wiþ longe seilyng parbraked &amp; forbroke— Wherfor þe[i] cast on hem to haue be wroke Al sodeinly, and settyn on of hede, And putte hem silf in auenture &amp; drede Of rakilnes, vn-avisely. Wher-of to hem ful vnhappily It be-fil whan þei þe Grekis mette With speris longe &amp; swerdis scharpe whette, Eche on oþer manhod for to schewe. But, for cause Troyans were so fewe, To issen oute þei dide folily; Þe felde was nat partid egally: For þe Grekis wern Innumerable, Þat hem to mete þe Troyans wern nat able— For þat tyme þei my?t[e] nat suffice: Þei toke on hem so passyng hi?e emprise— And ?it þei nolde for no þing hem withdrawe Til þei were wounded and y-slawe, And ouerleyn of Grekis outterly— Now here, now þere, bor doun cruelly, Merciles, as Guydo doth reporte, Þat hem behoveth hom ageyn resorte Of verray nede and necessite. And alle attonys gonne for to fle— I mene swiche as were lefte alyve— To þe castel þei hasten hem ful blive; For þei ne my?t no lenger holde felde Ageyns Grekis, with spere nor with schelde: Þei were to feble, schortly to conclude, To abide so gret a multitude. And as þei fle, þe Grekis a gret pas Ne cesse nat to swen on þe chas, Ful hastely to þe castel gate, And entren in, and by cruel fate Þei kille &amp; sle boþen hi?e &amp; lowe; Þei spare noon, ne list no wi?t to knowe Of non estat, but felly hem oppresse; And what þei fond, gold &amp; eke richesse, Vn-to schip þei cariden anoon; And of þe castel þei left nat a stoon Aboue a-noþer, but turnen vp so doun Boþe wal &amp; tour &amp; þe chefe dongoun, Þat no þing stood, so þei vnder-myne. Howe Agamenon layde his Oste byfore Thenedoun, a stronge Castele vj myle fro Troye, the which he wan, and it bet to þe grounde; and aftire þat, agally made distribucyoun of the godys. And whan al was brouþt vn-to ruyne, Grekis anoon to her schippes haste Of on assent, and purpos as faste, With-oute abood, of o wille and herte, Fro þat hauene pleynly to diuerte, And to saille towarde Tenedoun, A strong castel, whiche fro Troye toun In distaunce but sixe myle stood, Ful of tresour, of riches, and of good, Repleuysched of alle habundaunce. And whan þat þei with her ordinaunce I-seiled han, boþe sauf and sounde, And fro þe se taken han þe grounde, To her plesaunce wonder agreable, And of sy?t a place delitable, Holsom of eyr, þe soil ri?t fair &amp; grene, And lusty playnes goodly on to sene, And was also habundaunt of vitaille, Repleuesched of al þat may availle To hosteiyng and to soudyours— For firste þe lond, ful of fresche flours, Was plenteuous boþe of corn &amp; greyne, Of wyn &amp; frute, þat no þing ley bareyn, Of best and foules passingly plente— And fast[e] by stood also þe se, Ful habundaunt of fysches, as I fynde, After þe sesoun of euery maner kynde. And whan þat þei which Inne þe castel were Þe Grekis seie londen from a-fere, With-oute abood þei arme hem &amp; wente oute, And vppon hem make an hydous schout, Stuffyng þe castel with meine strong be-hynde, And toke her wey, in Guydo as I fynde, Toward her foon, &amp; kny?tly set vp-on. And ri?t furþe-with Grekis eke anoon Mette with hem vp-on þe toþer syde, Ful surquedous and ri?t ful of pride, Clenly armyd in harneis al of stel, Fresche arayed and be-seye so wel For þe felde, as þikke as swarme of ben— On eche syde men may beholde &amp; sen, Sprad al þe pleyn doun vn-to þe stronde, Til at þe last þei metten hond of honde, And assemble with square speris grounde, And hurtle I-fere, with many blody wounde. Þer was no “gooday,” nor no saluyng, But strokis felle, þat men herde rynge On basenettis þe strokis rounde aboute So cruelly þat þe fire sprange oute Among þe tuftis brode, bri?t, &amp; schene Of foil of gold &amp; feþres white &amp; grene. Eke in-to brestes percid many schelde, And besagus flen a-brood þe felde, And many a man lyn þat mortal stounde Ful dedly pale, lowe be þe grounde, With face gruf &amp; blody stremys wyde. And aldermost vp-on þe Grekis syde Þe slau?tre was and þe discounfiture, So my?tely Troyens dide endure. Til at þe last, for þei were so fewe, With multitude þe Grekis on hem hewe: For mo þan fourty wer ageyn[e]s on, Of verray force abak þei most[e] gon, No þing for lak of manhod, I dar seyn, But for so many han hem ouerleyn, Þei may no lenger in þe felde soiourne, But to her castel hom ageyn retourne In ful gret haste, swiche as my?t eskape Away a-live; and somme of hem for rape And drede of deth taken hem to fli?t On horse bak to Troye toun ful ri?t— No wonder was þou? þei hast[e] fast; For to þe gatis þe chas of Grekis last, So cruelly after þei purswe. And somme of hem þat my?t[e] nat remewe On Troye side, for-weried of fi?t, Þe Grekis slen with al her ful[le] my?t— Now here, now þere, whom þei my?t atteyne, Þer may no raunsoun nor no mercy geyne Of noon estat, wiþ-oute excepcioun. And after þat, vn-to Tenedoun Þe Grekis went, and it be-set aboute, Þat Troyan noon my?t eskapen oute. And whan þei had þe bolewerkis wonne, To skale þe wal after þei be-gonne, And made assaut manfully and ofte. And Troyens, as þei stood a-lofte, Putte hem of, þat entre þei ne my?t, With cast of stoon and quarel[e]s bri?t, With bowe turkeys &amp; schot of arblasteris, And her gonners stondynge at corners, Wiþ lym also, and cast of wylde fyre, Of Irous hate ful hot in her desire, Lik manly men hem silf[e] þei diffende. And ay þe Grekis, as þei vp ascende, Cruelly þei putte to þe grounde; Til þei with-oute an ordinaunce han founde, What with gynnys deuised for þe nonys, And gonnys grete, for to cast[e] stonys, Bent to þe touris, ri?t as any lyne, And large sowis lowe for to myne— And somme of hem vp-on þe wallis gon, Þat were so þikke made of lyme &amp; ston; And to entre þei many wayes seke, Sette her bastiles and her hurdois eke Rounde abo?te to þe harde wal, And skalyng ladderis for sautis marcial Þei gan vp cast, wiþ hokis for to holde. And vp ascende þe sturdy Grekis bolde, Til Troyens from þe crestis caste Þe grete stonys, whil þei wolde laste, And Callyoun eke Grekis to oppresse, And wonder manly dide her besynes In her diffence, and made hem plounge lowe With caste of quarel, &amp; with schoot of bowe Þoru? olietis, that of necessite Þei put hem of, it may noon oþer be, And broke her neckis &amp; her schulder bonys, As þei falle, with þe square stonys, And leyen ded, pitous pale of hew. But Grekis ay gan her saut renewe, Wiþ multitude Troyens to assaille, To withstonde þat þei gan [to] faille And wexe feble, for reskus cam þer non; And so of force þe Grekis ben y-gon Þoru? þe wallys whan þei han hem broke, And on Troyens so cruelly be wroke, Þat fynally þei lefte noon alyue, But sle and kylle; and after þat as blive, On þe wallis her baners þei han set, And ?onge &amp; olde—it my?t[e] be no bet— Al goth to wrak vp-on Troye side. And after þat, þei nyl no lenger byde, But tresour, gold, &amp; what þat þei may fynde Þei cast on hepe, &amp; to-gydre bynde, And made spoile of al þat was with-Inne; And þanne in haste þe wallis þei be-gynne— Pynacle &amp; tour, and also þe dongoun To brenne &amp; hewe, and to bete doun; And with þe soil þei made al euene &amp; pleyn. And with gret pray anoon þei went a-geyn To her schippes, glad &amp; li?t of chere, Whan þat þe fuyr with his flawmes clere Þe castel had conswmyd &amp; y-brent. And after þat, avise and prudent, Þe manly man, worþi Agamenoun, Lete make anon a convocacioun Of þe Grekis, &amp; bad þei schuld[e] bringe Gold and tresour, with-oute more tariyng, With al þe pray þei wan at Tenedoun, To his presence, for þis conclusioun: Þat he may make destribucioun Amongis hem, with-oute excepcioun, Like her decert—vn-to pore &amp; riche He departiþ to euery man y-liche, But moste to swiche as dide best disserue, For to hym silf hym list no þing conserue; For he hath leuer hertis þan þe good, Of swiche as had spent her owne blood So manfully þe castel for to wynne: For who þat can with larges first be-gynne, Ne failleþ nat after wel to spede Þoru? help of men, whan þat he haþ nede: For loue folweþ fredam comounly. And after þis, þe kyng lete make a crye, Þat alle þe kynges &amp; lordis of his hoste, Dukis, erlys com from euery coste, The nexte morwe to-forn hym to apere. Þe ny?t y-passed, Phebus gan to clere Her emyspyrie, aftir þe larke song, Whan þat þe kyng, among þe Grekis strong, Vp-on þe pleyn, in his se royal, And fast[e] by, most chef &amp; principal Of his lordis were set in her degre— And whan þe kyng sawe oportunyte, Þat þer was made silence euerywhere, His liges stondyng enviroun here &amp; þere, Þe kyng of chere sadde &amp; eke Iocounde, As he þat was of speche ful facounde, Be-gan his tale with sobre contenaunce, Þeffect of whiche was þis in substaunce: Howe Agamenon rememberde al his princes of the vngodely answeres that Anthenor had of them when he desyerd to haue had restitucyoun of Exiona, wherupon they sent Vlixes and Dyomede to Priamus, to haue restitucioun of quene Heleyne. “Sirs,” quod he, “ful worþi of degre, Of verray ri?t and necessite We be compelled, boþe hi?e &amp; lowe, With al oure my?t, liche as ?e wel knowe, To redresse a þing þat is amys: For þoru? þe world, as it reportid is, We ben of force, of power, &amp; of my?t, Of worþines in euery wi?ttes sy?t Most renomed &amp; most worschipable, And I-dempte &amp; Iuged for most able Of alle peples, &amp; likliest to stonde For to parforme what we take on honde, Who þat euere grucche[þ] or sey[þ] nay. ?it, me semeth, ?if it be to ?our pay, Þilke power most is acceptable Vn-to goddis, &amp; lengest stondeþ stable, Þat is deuoide of surquidie &amp; pride; For it is kouþe vppon euery syde, In eche lond, boþe of oon and alle, How many harmys &amp; grevis han be-falle Þoru? rancour only, pride, &amp; wilfulnes, So importable, as I coude expresse, Þat þoru? pride þer is don offence; Þe hi?e goddis make resistence To alle þo þat be surquedous, Whiche is a vice so contrarius Þat it may in no place abide. And in good feith, manhood is no pride: For who þat hath any acqueintaunce, Ouþer by frenschip or by alyaunce, With a prowde man, to be confederat Wiþ hym in herte, of hi?e or lowe estat, He nedis muste, what-euer þat he be, To many oþer of necessite Be lothsom first, enmy &amp; contraire; For no þing may a man so moche apaire As pride, in soth, in hi?e or lowe degre. Wherfore, I rede pleinly how þat we Þis foule vice oute of our hert arrace, Þat our quarel may haue þe more grace; And specially þat oure dedis alle Conveied ben, how-euer þat it falle, Be ri?twesnesse more þan volunte: For ?if trouþe oure sothfast guyde be, Vs to directe by his ri?tful lyne, Þan oure quarel schal ay in honour schine And contvne in ful felicite. And, ferþermore, þis knowen alle ?e, How we ar come for to do vengaunce, With oure frendschip and oure alliance, Vp-on Priam for wrongis don of olde By hym and hyse, as I haue ofte tolde; And here-vp-on we han his grounde I-take, And some of his maked to a-wake With manful honde, &amp; his castellis strong I-bete doun, þat stonden haue so longe, And take þere þe riches þat we founde, And slawe his men with many blody wounde, And harmys mo don in his contre, Þat I wot wel, ?if her enmyte Was vn-to vs gret &amp; moche a-fore, I dar seie now it is in double more; Þat ?if þat þei avenged my?t[e] be On vs echon, anon ?e schulde se Her gret Ire, so cruel &amp; so huge, Ben execute with-oute more refuge. And ?it, in soth, I wote þei han espied Oure beyng here—þou? we be nat askried Of hem as ?it, I dar seyn outterly, Þei are wel war þat we ar fast[e] by; And ouer-more, þis wote I wel also, Of þe harmys þat we han hem do, Þe whiche as ?it ben but fresche &amp; grene, ?if þei wer strong &amp; my?ti to sustene, A werre on vs anon þei wolde gynne. And ?it þe cite whiche þei ben Inne Is wallid strong &amp; tourid rounde aboute, Þat þei wene fully, oute of doute, With þe meyne þat þei haue gadrid Inne Of her alies, þat we schal nat wynne Of hem but smal in werre nor in strif: For he in sothe hath a prerogatyf And a-vauntage, þat in his contre Hym silfe diffendith; namly, ?if þat he Be stuffid strong of frendis hym be-side, And of allies, where he doth abyde; Like as þe rauen, with his feþeres blake, With-Inne his nest wil ofte tyme make Ageyn þe faukon—gentil of nature— Ful harde diffence whil[e]s he may dure, Or þat he be venquissched &amp; outtraied. And ?it som while þe faukon is delaied, Whils þe raven be-syde his nest doþ fle, With-Inne his couert at his liberte; As euery foule is froward to arest, For to be daunted in his owne nest. And ?it þis wordis to ?ou I nat sey In any wyse to putten in affray ?oure kny?tly hertis, so manly &amp; so stable, Nor þat to ?ou it schulde be doutable, But þe Troiens þat we schal confounde, And her cite, in whiche þei habounde, Pleinly distroie, al-þou? þat it be strong, And þei &amp; alle þat ben hem among Schal finally consumpt[e] be with deth, Þoru? Grekis swerde ?elden vp þe breth. But þe cause, with-outen any drede, Why I seye þus, is þat ?e take hede, For any pride or presumpcioun, To aduerte in ?oure discrecioun So prudently, þat resoun in þis nede For any hast may oure bridel lede, And so ordeyn, or we hen[ne]s wende, Þat laude &amp; pris aftir in þe ende May be reported, as I haue deuised: For many man þat hath nat ben avised, In his pursut, for lak of prouidence To sen to-forn in his aduertence What schulde falle, to deth it haþ him brou?t: Swiche wilful hast wer good to be þo?t Of vs a-forn be examynacioun, And wel deduct by reuolucioun Of þingkyng ofte, þat we nat repente. And first remembriþ how þat Priam sente To vs but late only for Exyoun, Þat is ?it holde of kyng Thelamoun, Whiche was of vs, with-oute avisement, Vndiscretly denyed by assent; Whiche hath to vs be non avauntage, But grounde &amp; rote of ful gret damage. For ?if þat we, þoru? wys purviaunce, Of hir had maked delyueraunce, Þe harmys grete had[de] ben eschewed, Þat aftir wern of Parys so pursewed In the temple of Cytherea, Þat bilded is be-side Cirrea— Þe tresour gret, also, þat he hadde, And Iowellis þat he wiþ hym ladde Þene to Troie, and þe gret riches, Þe slau?tre of men, and þe heuynes Þat ?it is made for þe quene Eleyne Þoru?-oute Grece, &amp; þe gret[e] peyne Of Menelay—al had ben vnwrou?t ?if we had[de] seyn þis in oure þou?t Wisely aforn, and Exyoun restored. Þan had nat þe harmys be so morid On vs echon, in verray sothfastnes, Nor spent oure labour so in ydelnes, Tresour nor good wasted so in veyn, Nor come so fer for to fecche ageyn Þe quene Eleyne, with costis importable, With-oute harmys, now in-eschuable: And for al þis, ?it ne wite we, Wheþer to Ioye or aduersite Þe þing schal turne þat we be aboute, Sith ofte sithe dependent &amp; in doute Is fatal þing, vnsiker &amp; vnstable, And fro þe gynnyng ofte variable Þe ende is seyn: Fortune can transmewe Hir gery cours; &amp; þerfore, to eschewe Þe harmys likly possible [for] to falle, My conseil is, here among ?ow alle, Vp-on trauail traueil to eschewe, In þis mater or we ferþer swe, To Priamus, with-outen any more, To sende first ageyn [for] to restore Þe quene Eleyne, as ri?t &amp; resoun is, And oþer harmys don eke be Parys, Aftir his trespas &amp; offencioun Iustly to make restitucioun. Þan may we alle in worschip &amp; honour Retournen hom, wiþ-oute more labour, ?if þei assent to don as we require; And oure axyng ?if hem list nat here, But folily, of her wilfulnes Refusen it, þan oure worþines Is double assured on a siker grounde, By iust[e] title Troyens to confounde. Wiþ þinges two we schal ben vnder-pi?t: First oure power, borne vp with our ri?t, Schal for vs fi?t our quarel to dareyne, In balaunce to weye atwixe vs tweyne To fyn þat we schal be more excusid; For þei to-forn han wilfully refusid Oure iust proferes made to hem a-fore; And we schal be þoru? þe world, þer-fore, With-oute spot of trespace or of blame, Of mysreport in hyndring of our name, Wher þei of foly schal y-noted be, Of wilful wodnes, pleinly, wher þat we Schal stond[e] fre oure power for to vse; And euery man schal vs wel excuse, Þou? þat we doon execucioun Be takyng vengaunce for her offencioun Of man and childe, of eche sect and age, Þat schal of deth holde þe passage, And be þe swerd, with-outen mercy, pace, Oon and oþer,—þer is no better grace. But ?it to-forn, I conseil takeþ hede Þat ?e to hem al[le] mesour bede: Þis hold I best and most sikirnes; And werketh now be good avisenes Among ?our silf, and no lenger tarie.” To whiche conseil some wern contrarie And variaunt to þis oppinioun, Saue þei þat wer of moste discrecioun Assentid ben pleinly to þis ende, And chosen han to Priam for to sende Amongis hem then bassiat to spede, Wyse Vlixes &amp; worþi Dyamede. Þe whiche anon gan hem redy make, And schop hem furþe and her weie take Toward Troye, as any lyne ri?t, Whan þe sone schon ful schene &amp; bri?t, Holdyng þe cours of his fyry spere In mydday arke, wonder bri?t &amp; clere, And gilt eche hil, vale, pleyn, &amp; roche With his bemys, whan þei did aproche To þe wallis &amp; gatis of þe toun. And in þei goon with-oute noyse or sown, Ful wel be-seyn, &amp; in her port hem hadde Ri?t manfully; and þe wey hem ladde To þe paleis, strei?t as any lyne— Hem nedeth nat a-side to decline, But in-to a courte large, wyde, &amp; square. And þei ful kny?tly for no wy?t wolde spare Vn-to theffect manly to procede To don her charge, with-oute fere or drede; For þe entre was to hem not refusid: For þo dayes paraunter was nat vsid To haue [no] conduit for embassatrie; Þe custom was to no man to denye, As I suppose, entre nor passage, ?if it so wer he come for massage. Howe wyse Vlixes and Dyomede enterde Ryale Ylion, of the which they marvelde when the byhelde þe beldynge. And in þis court, bilt so rially, Whan þei come, þei merveil ful gretly Þe rial si?t of so huge strengþe, So wel co[m]plete boþe in brede &amp; lengþe; For þei nat had in her lif to-fore Seyn noon so fayr; and ?it þei wondre more— In-to þe paleis as þei to-gidre goon, Þat pauyd was al of Iasper stoon— Of a tree þat amyddes stood, On whiche to loke hem þo?t it dide hem good, Musing wher it wer artificial, Erect or set by magik natural, Or by engyne of werkmen corious, Þoru? sotil craftis supersticious, Or oþer werke of nygromauncye, Or profond castyng of philosophie Be apparence or illusioun, Ouþer by craft of incantacioun: Vp &amp; doun þei casten in her mynde, Out by resoun ?if þei koude fynde Rote &amp; gronde of þis wondir wirke; But þe trouþe was to hem so dirke, Þat in her wit, þou? þei longe trace, Þe pryvite þei can nat oute compasse, To conseyue how it was possible. For to þe eye as it was visible, In verray soth, with-outen any fable, To mannys hond so it was palpable; Of whiche þe stok, of Guydo as is tolde, In sothfastnes was of purid gold, Whiche schon as bri?t as þe somer sonne To enlumyne þinges þat wer donne; And þe body as a mast was ri?t, Proporcioned most goodly to þe si?t, Substancial, &amp; of huge strengþe; And xii cubites þe body was of lengþe; And þe crop, rounde &amp; large of brede; And in compas gan so florische &amp; sprede, Þat al þe pleyn aboute enviroun, With þe bowis was schadowed vp &amp; doun. Þe riche braunchis and þe levis faire, Tweyne &amp; tweyne Ioyned as a payre— Oon of gold, anoþer of siluer schene, And meynt among with stonys whit &amp; grene, Some rede and some saphirhewed. And euery day þe blomys wer renewed; And þe blosmys, with many sondri swt; For stonys ynde it bare in stede of frut, As seith Guydo—I can no ferþer telle. Howe Vlixes and Diomede, withoute dewe reverence purposed þere Embassayte in þe presence of Priamus. And here ye shule se þe birthe of Eneas, and howe Agamenoun sent Achyle, and Thelefus to the Ille of Messay for an eyede of vitaile. And þe Grekis wil no lenger dwelle, But hilde her wey be many sondri went To parforme þe fyne of her entent, Til þei atteyne þe chambour principal, Wher Priamus in his se royal, Like his estat, in ful kny?tly wyse Saat, [and] aboute, ful prudent &amp; ful wyse, His lordis alle in setis hym be-syde— Whan þe Grekis, surquedous of pride, With sterne chere &amp; froward countenaunce, As þei þat hadde litel remembraunce Of gentilles nor of curtesye— For, as Guydo doth pleynly specefye, Entryng in þei taken han her place In thoposyt of þe kynges face, And sette hem doun, with-oute more sermoun, Any obeiyng or salutacioun, Worschip, honour, or any reuerence Done to þe kyng, for al his excellence, In preiudyce of al gentilles. And þan anon Vlixes gan expres Cause of her comyng to kyng Priamus, With-oute abood seiyng euene þus, Not forberyng presence of þe kyng: “Merueille nat nor haue no wondring, Þou? we to þe do non honour dew, In oure comyng þe for to salue, Sith it ne longeth, in soþ, as þinkeþ me, Wher rancour is &amp; hertly enmyte Of dedly hate, with salutaciouns, Or wiþ feyned fals affecciouns For to schewe, wher hertis ben a-fire: For naturelly no man schal desyre Of his enmye þe helthe nor welfare. And platly now me list nat for to spare Schortly to schewe þe fyn of our entent, Liche as we haue in commaundement In oure message from Agamenoun, Þe noble kyng, most worþi of renoun, Whiche vs hath sent, þer is no more to seyn, Now vn-to þe for þe quene Eleyne, Þat was rauissched oute of Grekis lond, And brout to Troye be force of my?ti hond, Ageynes ri?t, and by violence. Wherfore, schortly, with-out more offence, We iustly axe, with-out more demaunde, Þat þou anon ri?tfully comaunde To Menelay þat sche be sent ageyn; And with al þis, we axe nat in veyn Þat þou make restitucioun Of wrongis don in þat regioun, Of pilfres grete, slau?tre, &amp; robberye, By Paris don of wilful tyrannye, Whiche is þi sone, and by þe sustenyd, And in his errour wrongfully mayntenyd. Wherfore, come of and fully condescende, With-oute grucching, þese wrongis to amende: For so þou maist best þe goddis queme, Liche as þou my?t in þi resoun deme, As ri?t requereþ, to werchen as þe wyse. For ?if so be, þat þou now dispise To execute þat I haue tolde þe here, Trust me ri?t wel, a lessoun þou schalt lere, Whiche þou and þine schal aftir sore rewe, With-oute feynyng þou schalt fynde trewe, Þat, but ?if þou a better ende make, Cruel vengaunce schal on þe be take; And finally, what schulde I to þe feyne, Þe force of deth þis quarel schal dareyne Vp-on þe and vp-on al þi blod, Raunsomles outher of gold or good. And questionles, reporte þis of me, Þat mercyles þis riche strong cite Schal doun be bete and y-layd ful lowe, Wal &amp; toures also ouerthrowe. Þis al and som; be now wel avised Þat oure axyng of þe be nat dispised, But wisly werke &amp; do as I haue seid.” And sodeinly kyng Priamus abreide, Of hasty Ire he my?t[e] nat abide, Of þe Grekis whan he sawe þe pride, Þe grete outrage and presumpcioun— Wiþ-oute abode or deliberacioun, To Vlixes anon he gan out breke, And [vn-]to hym euene þus to speke: “I wondre gretly in myn aduertence, Beyng astonyed how ?e in my presence So vngoodly dar make þis demaunde, Like as ?e had power to comaunde And me constreyne ?our biddyng to obeye, And I for fere durste nat wiþ-seye No maner þing þat ?e axen here, Nor contrarie what þat ?e requere; Wher-of sothly in hert I am amevid, And of ?our þretis inwardely a-grevid, And astonid, surly nat a lite, Þat ?e ar bold so me to excite, And vilenly myn honour to prouoke On ?oure wordis for to ben awroke. But for al þis, trusteþ me ri?t wel, I wil nat passe my boundis neuer-a-del, Nor þe raþer, schortly at þe ende, To ?our axynge in no þing condescende; For considerid þe fyn of ?our entent, It wer nat syttyng nor conuenient A kyng to graunte ?our axyng, þou? þat he Stood in meschef and captiuite, With-oute recure to outtraunce brou?te. It were outrage, pleinly, to be þou?te, To axe of hym þat ?e axe of me! And sothly, ?it, I suppose nat þat ?e Acomplissching may so moche availle As ?e han seid; for platly ?e schal faille Of ?our purpos, I seie, &amp; God to-forne, Maugre ?oure my?t, þou? ?e had it sworne: For ?oure request, in euery wy?tis si?t, Wanteth a grond, boþe of trouþe &amp; ri?t— Þat axe of me satisfaccioun!— And were ?oure silfe first occasioun, Whan ?e slowe my fader Lamedoun And his liges, &amp; brenten eke his toun, And many harmys, ?if þei wern [out] sou?t, On hym and hyse causeles ?e wrou?t, Þat it were longe al for to reherse— Which day be day þoru? myn hert[e] perse— My suster eke, callid Exyoun, ?e ladde a-weye oute of þis regioun, Þe whiche is nat vn-to hir worþines I-tretid like, nor aftir gentillesse. And for al þis ?e wolde a-mendis haue Wrongly of me, þat whilom for to saue Al þing in pees &amp; to stynte werre, To ?ou sente in-to Grece ferre Only to han had Exyoun ageyn, Of whiche sond ?e had but disdeyn, And cruelly and in vngoodly wyse My massanger ?e gonne to dispise, Þat he vnneþe my?t eskape away Out of Grece—?e knowe it is no nay— Of ?ou he had so vngoodly chere.

Wherfore, in hast, with-out wordis mo, My conseil is, þat ?e ben a-go Out of my si?t, and voideþ þis cite; For þus it stant: whiles I ?ou se, In myn herte may entre no gladnes, Þe fret of Ire put me in swiche distres, Þat, in good feith, I may it nat sustene, So importune is þe rage and tene Þat inwardely bynt me for þe while.” And Dyamedes þo be-gan to smyle, And seid anon þus vn-to þe kyng: “?if it so be þat þou of oure comyng In þin hert hast so moche peyne Vs to beholde now þat be but tweyne, And art þerwith so inly set a-fyre, Þan schaltow neuere ben with-oute Ire In al þi lif, nor deuoide of wo, Siþen þou hast so many cruel fo Of Grekis now entrid in þi lond— An hundrid þousand almost at þin hond, Ageyn whos my?t þou maist þe nat assure To resiste, pleynly, nor endure, Consydred wel how þat þei be strong, As þou schalt wit, paraunter, or ou?t longe, So manly men &amp; so wel arrayed, Expert in armys, and of old assaied, Þat no diffence may ageyn hem vaille. And wite eke wel, þat þou maist nat faille Be deth of swerde of her hond to deye, And alle þine—þer is no more to seye— Þou? it so be, proudly þat þou speke, And with þi tonge, only to be wreke, Affermyst more þan þou maist acheue: Bettre it were swiche wordes leue, And to wys counseil take bettre hede.” But þan in haste ageyn þis Dyamede, Surquedous and most ful of pride, Þer rose vp some be þe kynges syde With swerdis drawe, &amp; on hym han falle And al to-hew, þer amonge hem alle, Of hasty Ire brennyng as þe glede; Til Priamus gan to taken hede, And roos hym vp, seyng þis dissese, And manfully þis rage gan appese, Hem diffendyng vp-on deth &amp; life, Þat non of hem be hardy in þis strife Þenbassatours to harmen or to greue:— “For þou? a fool his foly wil nat leue To presume to speke vnkonnyngly, A wys man moste suffre paciently; And [þou?] þat he happe doon offence Þoru? foly speche, for lak of sapience, To a wysman ne longeþ, soth to seyn, To take hede or to speke a-geyn: For as to a fole it is pertynent To schewe his foly, ri?t so convenient Is to þe wyse, softly, with suffraunce, In al his port to haue tolleraunce. For to folis longeth kyndely, With-oute a-vis to speke folily, Vndiscretly his menyng to fulfille, Where a wysman schal heryn &amp; be stylle Til he se tyme, and haue pacience, And dyssymule in his aduertence Þe rage of folis þat last but a þrowe: For be his tonge a fole is ofte knowe; And leuer I hadde, I do ?ou wel assure, In my persone damage to endure, Þanne to suffre any messanger In my court, of ?ow þat ben here, To han a wronge, ouþer grete or lite— Þe swerde of rancour may nat alwey bite, To do vengaunce for a þing of nou?t. For ofte it falleth a wrong is wrou?t: For litel excesse folweþ gret reprefe; And hast is ay medlid with meschefe. Wherfore, I bidde þat ?e sitte doun, And in no wyse, of presumpcioun, Attempteþ nat, in no maner wyse, Be signe or worde more for to dispise Þembassatours from þe Grekis sent, But late hem frely declaren her entent, And ?e þer-whiles kepe ?our lippes clos.” And sodeinly þanne Eneas aros, Whiche nexte þe kyng hadde þan his se, So inwardly with rancour fret was he, Þat he ne my?t hym siluen nat restreyn, And seid[e]: “sir, so ?e nat disdeyne Þat I schal seyn, me semeth þat it is Wel a-cordyng, whan oon haþ seid amys And reklesly spoken vn-avised, Of his foly þat he be chastysed, Þat oþer may exaumple by hym take, To be wel war swiche noise &amp; cry to make, And specially in open audience So toffende ?our royal excellence! And sothly ?it, I wot wel þat I my?t So me gouerne, pleynly, in ?oure si?t, Of hastynes with-oute avisement, Þat I schulde by ?our commaundement Þe deth disserue for my gret offence. And trewly ?it, ne wer [for] ?oure presence, On þis tweyne þat han so I-spoke, With-oute abood I schuld anoon be wroke: For it wer worþi &amp; ri?t wel sittyng, Whan þat a fool in presence of a kyng Is bolde or hardy of presumpcioun To take on hym of indiscrecioun Þing to reherse, concludyng in sentence Preiudice of ?oure magnificence, Þat he were tau?t bettre to gouerne His large tonge, to konne bet discerne Whan he schal speke or whan ben in pes, To suffren hym to renne out of les, As doth he þis þat spoken haþ so large. Wherfor, in hast, I conseil hym &amp; charge, With-oute abood, or any wordis mo, Out of ?oure si?t anon he be ago, For it is best to don as I hym rede.” To whom anon ful proudly, Dyomede, Nat astonyd, but with a sterne loke, To Eneas, þat for Ire quoke, Answerde ageyn with wordis but a fewe, And seide: “sir, þi speche doþe wel schewe, What so þou be, þat þou art ri?t wys. Wel is þat kyng, þat doþe be þin avys, Or hath þe ny?e of conseil for to be; For he ne may erre in no degre— Þat art so ri?tful in þi Iugement, Of wilfulnes, wiþ-oute avisement, To cause a lord his boundis for to pace. So wolde God, in som oþer place Þat I my?t, be fauour of Fortune, Metyn wiþ þe at leiser oportune, Like my desire, þat canst so wel endite— I nolde faile þi labour for to quyte, And þe to þanke for þi gentil chere, Whiche so kny?tly þou hast vs schewed here— Trust wel þer-to: I haue þer-of no drede!” And þo Vlixes of þis Dyomede Gan interrupte his wordis prudently, And to hym seide ful avisely Þat it was best to stynten &amp; be stille. “And now we know fully al þi wille,” Quod Vlixes ful manly to þe kyng, “We wil gon hens, with-oute [more] tariyng, Out of þi si?t to Agamenoun, And make to hym pleyn relacioun Of þin answere, in ordre by and by.” And to hors þei went sodeynly, And in schort tyme so hast hem on her weye, Þat þei be come, þer is no more to seie, Wher þe kyng sat in his tentorie; And worde by worde, as cam to memorie, Þei reherse þe substaunce euery-del, Wher-of þe Grekis like no þing wel, Conceyving ful þer was no remedie, As be report of þe embassatrye, Saf only þis: outerly procede, Howe þei hem schal gouernen in þis nede Ageyn[es] Troyen[s], of necessite; For þei wel wot it may noon oþer be, And assentid, boþe in wille and dede: To purveye hem fast[e] þei hem spede, In þis story as ?e schal aftir fynde. But or þat I make þer-of mynde, I most a while of Eneas endyte, As myn auctor list of hym to write: Þe whiche, soþely, as bokis seyn, he was, Þis manly Troyan, þis famus Eneas, Anchises sone, of gret worþ[i]nes, Whilom gete of Venus þe goddes, Conquerour of many regioun. Whan Troye was brou?t to destruccioun, He went his weye by þe large se, Callid Tirene, &amp; sailyng forþe goþe he Be many cost &amp; many narow passage, Many daunger, til in-to Cartage He rivid is, and þus gan to saille To þe conquest of þe gret Ytaille; And so to Rome he hath þe wey[e] take. Of whos of-spryng, as auctour[e]s make, Cam Augustus Cesar, þe Emperour, Þat was whilom so noble a conqueror, Þat his renoun to þis day doth schyne. And of Enee, themperour Iustyne, In his boke, callid Autentikes, Ful pleynly writ þer in þe rubrikes: Þat aftir Cesar, so as Sesares Be named ?it, ri?t so Eneades, After Enee þe name schulde bere, Whiche fro Troye comen was so fere Vn-to Ytaille. And of þis Eneas, As I haue tolde, Cesar discendid was Doun lyne ri?t, ful manly &amp; royal, Þat first in Rome be septer imperial, Maugre her my?t, had[de] gouernaunce, And of wisdam sette in gouernaunce Comoun þinges touchyng þe cite. And to procede ferþer of Enee, Holly his lyf &amp; kny?thod by &amp; by ?if þat ?e list to rede Ceriously, ?e may se al, ful awtentik of style, In Eneydos compiled of Virgile: Al-be it so, þat þis noble clerke Was graue a-forn or complet was his werk, As bokes olde make mencioun. But now ageyn to Agamenoun, With-oute more, my stile I wil retourne. Howe Achilles enterde the Ille of Messay, where Teutram was kynge, whom Achilles gave his dethes wounde. And howe Teutram resyngnede his kingdam to Thelaphus, for the affeccyon that he had to Archules, which was his Fadere, and of olde tyme made him kynge of þat Ille. Þe whiche kyng wil no more soiourne In þis mater delayes for to make, But in al hast he hath his counseil take Of his lordis, beyng þo present, And swyche as wer nat, he haþ after sent For oon &amp; alle: erlis, dukis, kynges, And seid[e], “sirs, amongis oþer þinges To our Iourne þat be necessarie, My counseil is, no lenger þat we tarie, But first of al to maken ordinaunce, By oon assent, with prudent purvyaunce, Þat aldirfirste we schape for vitaille, With-oute whiche noon host may availle To parforme a Iourne þriftely. Wherfor I rede, here but fast[e] by, ?if it to ?ow be likyng and plesaunce, In-to an Ile ful of habondaunce, Callid Messa, þat we sende anoon.” And, at a worde, assentid euerychon. Þei chosen han worþi Achilles And Thelefus, þe sone of Hercules, To execute þis purpos fynally, Wiþ many worþi in her company I-chosen oute þoru? þe hoste anoon Wiþ Achilles to Messa for to gon. In whiche lond, riche and plenteuous, Regned a kyng, worþi and famous, Þat Teutran hi?t; whiche in tranquillite, With-oute werre or aduersite, Had holde his septer &amp; his royal sete In þis Ile, so plesaunt and so mete— Al-be þat some sein þis litel Ile To þe kyngdam longeth of Cecile, And hath his name ?ouen of plente, After Messane, an huge gret cite, Ful plenteuous, boþe on se and lond. Þe whiche kyngdam, as I vndirstonde, Is seide Messana, of Messes in latyn, Þoru? habondaunce of frut, corn, &amp; wyn, At tharyuaille on her pleyn[e]s large, Wher þei ar wont [for] to stuf and charge Marchaunt schippes of straunge fer contre, Þat þider saile by þe large se To fecche vitaille, ay fro ?er to ?er, Fro many cost of londis fer and ner, Only beschaunge of oþer marchaundyse. And eke also, as bokis can deuise, And as Guydo [ful] pleinly telleth vs, Þat of a kyng, callid Messanus, Þis contre first of Messa toke þe name, Þat in his tyme was of ful gret fame, Passyng riche and wonder plenteuous. But of al þis, Dares Frigius In his boke makeþ no mencioun, But schortly telleth, in conclusioun, How Achilles, and Thelefus also, To Messana ben to-gidre go With þre þousand of Grekis chosen oute, Most manly men amongis al her route. Þe whiche as fast as þei gan to londe, And þe kyng gan to vndirstonde Of her comyng, [he] is descendid doun With alle þe worþi of his regioun, On hors and fote, in stel armyd bri?t, Ageyn[e]s Grekis manfully to fi?t, Hem to deuoide, pleinly, ?if he can. And sodeinly þus þe skarmus gan Atwixe Grekis and her mortal foon, On ouþer part þat þer was many oon Slayn and hurt, &amp; to þe deþ y-woundid, Euere vnlikly þer-of to be soundid; For oþer trete was noon hem betwene, But swerdis scharp &amp; speris square &amp; kene: Now here, now þere, þat þei go to gronde; For euery man his fo for to confounde His labour dide &amp; his besynes. And þou? Grekis, þoru? her worþines, Had on her foon moche londe I-wonne, ?it to resort after þei begonne; And merveil noon, be-cause þat her foon Hadde alwey þre in noumbre ageyn[e]s on— For þe tyme it may noon oþer be— Til Achilles gan be-holde and se Þe mortal slau?ter vp-on Grekis side, Turnyng þe bak, with woundis large &amp; wyde; Of hasty rancour chaunge gan his blood, And for Ire furious and wood, Whan he be-hilde his men lese her lond, He with þe swerde þat he hilde in his hond Made weie, killeth, and bare doun; And in þe felde like a ferse lyoun He ferde in soth, whan his men wer slaw, Makyng his foon bakward to withdraw, And his Grekis so manly recounforte, Þat maugre hem he made hem to resorte. And who þat euere in his weye stood, With-oute mercy he kylleþ in his mood, Þat geyneþ nat in his cruelte; For dout[e]les, nadde his manhod be, His passyng renoun and his worþines, His kny?thod eke, and his hi?e prowes, Þe Grekis had þat day finally Venquissched be, with-oute remedie; But þoru? his helpe þei recuren al: For Achilles, sturdy as a wal, Gan cerche scheltrouns &amp; her rengis brake, To-fore whos face his fomen go to wrake. And aldirlast, whan he gan espie Teutran þe kyng, þoru? his chiualrie Diffende hym silf lik a worþi kny?t, And as a lioun bern hym in his fi?t, Now her, now þer, Grekis so oppresse— Þis Achilles, of cruel hardynesse, Nolde cesse in his pursewyng Þoru? þe wardis, til he cam to þe kyng, Of manly force, stout, &amp; ful of pride, Makyng a weye rounde on euery syde, Ageyn whos my?t no þing my?t availe. And of Teutran first þe aventaile He raced haþe, &amp; rent þe mail a-sonder, And al to-hewe—þat it was a wonder To considre þat day his cruelte. And after þat, al to-broke hath he His basenet, with many cruel wounde, Of verray my?t smet þe kyng to grounde; And in al haste he maked hath no let, Of his hed to rende his basenet, And merciles for to do vengaunce, His arme he gan on hei?te to avaunce, Fully in purpos þat he schal be ded, And raunsomles gan amyn at his hed With blody swerde, &amp; dispitous herte, Castyng pleinly he schal hym nat asterte— In his Ire he was so furious. But of fortune it be-fil ri?t þus, Þat Thelephus, þe ?ong[e], lusty kny?t, Casuely þer-of had a sy?t, And of Achille þe maner ful behilde: Þe stroke anoon he bare vp with his schelde, And gan Achilles mekely for to preye To han pite so to done hym deye, Sith he lay wonded almost to þe deth, Brou?t to þe point to ?elden vp þe breth, Beseching hym, for his benignite, Of manly rouþe &amp; kny?tly eke pite, With-drawe his hond &amp; to don hym grace, And graunt hym lyf for a litel space: “Sith euery kny?t schulde of gentilles His enmy spare, whan he is in distres, To outtraunce brou?t, &amp; specialy whan he Mercy requiriþ of humble volunte.” To whom Achille, feruent in his Ire, As he þat was of rancour set a-fyre, Answerde ageyn: “what list þe so to praye For hym þat nolde of pride our wyl obeye, But folily, of vngoodlyhede, Gan a werre, where as was no nede, Of disdeyn and indignacioun, Havynge a trust of presumpcion In his manhod, whiche my?t him nat avaylle Ageyn[e]s Grekis to holden a bataille, As it is preuid pleynly in þe ende, Al oþer-wyse schortly þan he wende. For in þe dyche iustly he is falle, Whiche he made of malis for vs alle, Wher we of wil nor entencioun ?af vn-to hym noon occasioun, Vp-on no syde, platly, fer nor ner, Nor mynystrede to hym no mater, Nor to his londe mente no damage— But hym silfe, grounde of al þis rage— With-oute offence don to hym of vs.” And efte ageyn ?onge Thelephus Humblely requerid of Achille, Of kny?tly rou?þe his axyng to fulfille, And to han mercy on hym in þis caas. “For with my fader þis kyng whilom was,” Quod Thelefus, “be bond confederat, Whiche lithe now here al disconsolat, Exspectaunt only, with a dedly face, Vp-on þe hour whan his gost schal pace, Þoru?-girt, allas! with many mortal wounde; And for cause I haue in hym founde A-fore þis tyme ful gret kyndenes— For of manhod and of gentilles, In þe boundis of his regioun He vn-to me, þoru? his hi?e renoun, Whilom as I casuely gan ride, Schewed in soþe, vp-on euery side, Ful ryal chere and gret humanyte, Þat I am bounde of verray du[e]te To remembre &amp; to han in mynde; And dout[e]les, ellis I were vnkynde, Which after wolde my name foule atwite, And for þat I parcel wolde hym quyte, I ?ou beseche of respit of his lif.” And Achilles, with-outen any stryf, Delyuered hath, þe story telleth þus, Teutran frely vn-to Thelefus, Wheþer hym list to sauen or to spille. And whan þat he hadde hym at his wille, He considrede by hys woundis grene, Þat were so mortal, sothly, &amp; so kene, Of verray nede þat he muste dye— Þer was no geyn nor no remedye, Nor availle may no medycyne. Þe hour whan Phebus westward gan declyne, And þe bataille brou?t was to an ende, While þe Grekis to her schippes wende, Þe mene whyle, Teutran for þe peyne Of his woundis gan more &amp; more compleyne, With-oute staunche so pitously þei blede: His officeris fast[e] gan hem spede, In a liter, maked ful ryal, Toward his paleis &amp; dongoun principal To carien hym softe and esely; And at his prayer, ful benignely, Thelefus and also Achilles Conveied hym amongis al þe pres, Til he was brou?t þer as him list to be; And þei reseyuid, like to his degre, [Ful] Ryally þe kyng, ay languysschinge, As he þat drowe toward his endynge, And my?t[e] nat lenger drawe alengþe His woful lif, so weyk was [he] of strengþe, Þat his spirit muste algatis wende. And he in haste made for to sende For Achilles and for Thelefus; And whan þei cam, he seide [vn-]to hem þus: “Sirs,” quod he, “ful worþi of degre, Helpe and honour with longe prosperite Be vn-to ?ow, and good auenture Al þe while [þat] ?our lif may dure; And specially to þe, o Thelephus, Whiche hast to me ben so gracious, Of gentilles, in my peynes stronge, Only of grace my lif for to prolonge— But deth, allas! I may nat nowe eschewe, Nor his swerde on no parte remewe, With-oute recur knyt in bitter bondis, Vp-on þe brinke falle of Fatis hondis, Of my lif al fully in dispeir, Whiche of my body neuer my?t haue eyr After my day, by successioun, To gouerne þis litel regioun, Whiche like[ly] is to stonde dissolat Of gouernaunce, and disconsolat, Whiche þat I wan with ful gret trauaille; And to þis day, with werre and bataille, I haue it kept, as ?e wel knowe echon, And defendid from alle maner foon, With-oute loos, ?eris her-to-forne. But recurles of ?ore I hadde it lorne, Ne had I had helpe and eke socour Of Hercules, þe grete conquerour, Þat whilom was fader of Thelephus— So strong, so my?ti, and so chiualrous— Be whos manhod &amp; whos hardynes, Be his kny?thod and gret worþines, Whiche day be day is newe of memorie, Of al my foon I hadde þe victorie: He daunted hem and made hem so a-ferde, Only by rigour of his scharp[e] swerde, Þat finally, þoru? his manlihede He made me þis regne to possede, Maugre her my?t, in pes and in quiete, With septre and crowne in my royal sete, Þat noon of hem, til þat he was ded, Hardy was to lyften vp þe hed Ageyn[e]s me, to speke in wordis fewe.” Wher-by I may fully declare and schewe By euydence, þat þis litel Ile Is pertynent and longeth to Secile, Wher Hercules for a memorial Sette pilers in his conquest royal, Whan he had ride and go so fere, And of Columpna ?it þe name bere, After hym callid Herculea— Þou? somme seyn þei hote Herracula, Þe name chaungyng by corrupcioun. Þe whiche londe was whilom mansioun To þe peple of wilde Barbarie; Þe whiche kyngdam for to magnifie, Frederik, sothly, þe secunde, Of gold and good passyngly habounde, Þat chose was to ben Emperour Of Rome toun, and my?ti gouernour, And whilom eke was kyng of Secile— Whiche made reise in þat large Ile A my?ti tour, hi?e and þikke of wal, As seyth Guydo, for a memorial To putte his name longe in remembraunce; And for þe soil was to his plesaunce, With floures fresche of many sondry hewe, In somme bokis þe lond was namyd newe And I-called, as I vndirstonde, For his fairnes, “þe lusty newe lond.” But Teutran ay lyggyng in his peyne, As he þat fast[e] gan þe hour atteyne Of cruel deth, a-forn his lordis alle He made in haste Thelefus to calle To his presence, and with a mortal chere Seide openly, þat alle my?ten here: “My sone,” quod he, “now þat I schal passe Out of þis worlde—for geyn[e] may no grace My lif to saue, þoru? no mannys my?t— But for be-cause of equite and ri?t I am compelled, iustly in sentence, To declare clerly my conscience To-fore my deth, heryng al þis pres— Þis to seyn, þi fader Hercules, Þe wyse worþi, and þat kny?tly man, Whilom þis lond þoru? his conquest wan; Þe whiche only of his goodlyhede, As he þat was þe stok of manlyhede, Toke vn-to me, by commyssioun, Þe gouernaunce of þis regioun, Of his fre wille, with hool þe regallye, And nolde hym silf þe crowne occupie; And sothly, ?it his ri?t was nat þe lasse. For loue of whom, now þat I schal passe, With al thentent of my laste wil, To þe I graunte, as it is ri?t and skil, As verray eyer iustly to succede, Longe in honour þer þi lif to lede, Makynge here a protestacioun, Þat in ful tokene of confirmacioun Þis is þe wil, finally, of myn herte, Fro þe whiche no man may diuerte Vp-on no side, nor outterly declyne. For first my wil and discent of lyne Ben to-gidre combyned now in oon, Fro whiche þing no mortal man may gon: For þis desire, last of my langour, Þat þou playnly be my successour; And finally, þus I conclude and deme, Þat vn-to þe septre and dyademe Deliuered be, wiþ euery circumstaunce.” But al his wil, for more assuraunce, He made write in his testament, Þe fyn concludyng of his last entent. And after þat, he ful pitously Telephus besou?t[e] hertely, Of manly rouþe &amp; kny?tly gentilles To done his deuer and his besynes, After his deth, liche his estat royal, To halwe and holde þe feste funeral Solempnely, and þe exequies do. And sodeynly, with-oute wordis mo, Þe kyng Teutran ?eldeþ vp þe gost, And went his wey, I not in-to what cost— I can nat deme of swiche mystyhede. And whan Parchas broken han þe þred On þe rokke, and he was forþe his way, Þan Telefus, out of marbil gray Coriously a tombe made kerue, Þe dede cors þer-in to conserue Ful richely; and a-boue þe graue An Epithaphie anoon he dide graue, In his honour pleinly to expresse His kny?thod boþe, and [his] worþines, And how his gost &amp; he wer deuocid— Wiþ lettris riche of gold aboue enbocid Rounde aboute wonder corious, On his tombe, þat seide pleinly þus: Howe Kenge Teutram was buryede in A riche Epethaphye graven with sotele vers. “Here lyth Teutran þe kyng, dout[e]les, Whilom slawe of cruel Achilles, Þat his septre and þe regalie Holy ?af, whiche no man may denye, To Thelefus, sone of Hercules, Whiche in his tombe resteþ now in pes.” Whan þis parformyd was in euery þing, And Thelefus was crowned in-to kyng, And hi?e and low, al be on assent, Hadde openly in a parlement Made feith to hym and y-don homage Lik to her degrees, as þei wern of age, And with hool hert, in al þer best entent, Be othe assurid and be sacrament, As trew[e] liges reseived hym for kyng, Þan Achilles, with-oute more tariyng, Whan al was sette in pes &amp; gouernaunce, With-oute gruchyng or any variaunce, To her schippes anoon he made carie Euery þing þat was necessarie To þe Grekis, corn, frute, and vitaille, Flesche or fysche, or what þat my?t availle To hosteyng, or helpe hem in her nede— Doun to þe see al he dide lede, Fully her vessel for to stuf &amp; lade. And Thelefus after þis he made Stille in þe boundis of his regioun For to abide, for þis conclusioun: Þat þoru? his helpe &amp; his dilligence, Besynes and discret prouidence, Ageyn al meschef and al skarscite, Whan þei nede, he my?t her socour be— Al-be þat he, liche as seith Guydo, With Achilles ful fayn wolde haue go; But he abod, sothly for þe beste, Be bond assured fully and beheste In euery þing Grekis to releue. And þan in haste Achilles toke his leue Of Thelefus, and gan anon to saille, Alle his schippes stuffid wiþ vitaille, Toward Grekis, as made is mencioun; And in schort tyme he at Tenedoun Aryued is, and taken hath þe grounde With alle his kny?tis, boþe heil &amp; sounde. And aftir þis, to Agamenoun He made first ful relacioun Of his expleyt, lik as it was falle, In þe presence of his lordis alle, Sitting enviroun many worþi kny?t. And first, in Messa, he telleþ of þe fi?t, Whan þei entre, &amp; of her wolcommyng; And ceriously, he tolde eke of þe kyng Þat Teutran hi?t, &amp; pleinly also how Achilles amyd þe felde hym slowe, And or his deth, how he of hool entent Fully ordeyned in his testament Thelefus also to ben his heyr. Al þis he tolde, &amp; eke of his repeire Vn-to þe se, and eke of þe vitaille, And Thelefus, how he wil nat faille To senden hem al þat may hem plese— Of whiche þing þe Grekis in gret ese Were brou?t of hert, &amp; lyke wonder wel, Whan Achilles had tolde hem euerydel, And gretly preise his hi?e prouidence, His manhod boþe, &amp; his sapience, In his oute-beyng þat he bare hym so. And aftir þis Achilles is go To his loggyng, a litel þer be-syde, Where his kny?tes vp-on hym abyde, Myrundones, ful glad of his commyng, And hym reseyue as longeþ to a kyng, Where he a-bood &amp; restid hym a while. But for Guydo declineþ here his stile From þe Grekis to hem of Troye toun, I muste also make digressioun, Of myn auctor þe steppis for to sewe, Like as it is conuenient &amp; dewe To my mater, sith he is my guyde, And for a while Grekis sette a-side, And reherse how Dares Frigius In Troye boke declareth vn-to vs, And ceriously maketh mensioun Of þe lordis þat cam to Troye toun To helpe hem manly in her diffence, Ageyn Grekis to make resistence With ordinaunce of many diuerce þinges— Þer cam to hem erlis, dukis, kynges, As in Dares pleinly is made mynde, Redeth his boke &amp; þer ?e may it fynde. Here folowyngly be rehersed the namys of þe kyngis that kame to help the Cite of Troye. And aldirfirst, I rede how þat he Specially speketh of kynges þre, Ful manly men, &amp; also of gret fame— Al-be þat he reherseth nat þe name Of her kyndammys—?it he writeþ þus: Þe first of hem was callid Pandarus, And as I rede, Thabor þe secounde, Þe þridde Andastrus, liche as it is founde; And as Guydo liste to specifie, Þre þousand kny?tes in her companye, And manly men þei were euerychon. And from an Ile, callid Coloson, Liche as Dares liketh to expresse, Þer cam also, of excellent prowes, Kynges foure; of whiche þe first[e] was, As he writ, I-named Carias, And þe secounde hi?t Ymasyus, Nestor þe þride, þe fourþe Amphimacus; And fiue þousand worþi kny?tes alle Þer cam with hem manly for to falle Vp-on þe Grekis in helping of þe toun. And from an Ile of ful gret renoun, Callid Lycye, cam þe kyng Glaucoun, And wiþ hym brou?t his sone Sparedoun, A noble kny?t, in armys ful famous, And was allyed to kyng Priamus; And þre þousand, ?if I schal nat feyne, Þer cam of kny?tes with þese lordis tweyne. And from Larisse, a riche lond also, As I fynde, þer cam kynges two; And hem to quite manly, as þei ou?te, A þousand kny?tes þei to Troye brou?te. And from a kyngdam named Lycaoun, Caphemus, a kyng of grete renoun, Brou?t with hym, as Dares bereþ witnes, A þousand kny?tes of gret worþines. And fiue hundrid, Dares telleþ vs, Cam with Hupon and wiþ Epedus, Manly kny?tes, in platis siluer bri?t. And with hym eke a kyng þat Remus hi?t Brou?t þre þousand to Troye many mile From Tabaria his large my?ti Ile; And dukis foure, with al her chiualry, And erlis ey?te cam in his companye, Hauyng in armys gret experience; And alle þei bare, with-oute difference, Her men &amp; þei, whan þei wer in þe felde, Þe chef of gold eueryche in his scheld, Wherby þe kyng, &amp; holy his meyne, Among hem alle knowe my?t[e] be, Al-be þat oþer boren eke þe same. And from Trace kyng Pilex, by his name— Fro þilke Trace þat is most excellent, Whiche in þe plage of þe oriente Haueth his syyt—from whiche þis my?ti king A þousand kny?tes brou?t at his comyng; And as myn auctor recordeth eke also, An hundrid kny?tes ben to Troye go Wiþ Alcamus, a duke eke ful famus, Þat cam with Pilex, Guydo writeth þus, Troyans to helpe in her grete nede. And fro Panonye, soth[ly] as I rede, Cam Pretemissus, þe noble werriour, Lord of þat lond, kyng and gouernour, And duke Stupex with him eke he hadde, And of kny?tes a þousand þat he ladde Toward[es] Troye from his regioun. And as þe stori makeþ mencioun, Þat Ile stant moste be wyldernes, And be wodis of plenteuous þiknes, Growyng þer-in ful many diuerse tre, And moste is forest þat men þere may se; For þei þer bilde howses but a fewe; And in þat lond ful diuersly hem schewe Many liknes, queint and monstruous, Bestis vnkouþe, to si?t[e] meruelous, Stoundemele, as bi apparence, By illusioun fals in existence, Wonder gastful, pleynly, for to sene: For diuerse goddis of þe wodis grene Appere þere, called Satiry, Bycornys eke, fawny and incuby, Þat causen ofte men to falle in rage; And of þis lond þe peple is ful sauage, Hardy kny?tes, furious &amp; wood, And desyrous ay to scheden blood, Gretly expert, specialy to schete Wiþ dart &amp; spere, perellous to mete, For þei cast euen as any lyne. And from an Ile þat named was Botyne, In gret array to Troye þe cite, Like as I fynde, þer cam dukis þre: Þe first of hem callid Anphimvs, Samvs þe secounde, þe þridde Forcynus, And as seith Dares, whiche list nat lye, Twelue hundrid kny?tes in her companye. And fro Bitvnye, as made is remembraunce, Þe riche lond, þat hath swiche habundaunce Of spicis, gommys, frutis, corn, &amp; wyn, Holsom rotis, ryndis, riche and fyn, Wonder vnkouþe and precious also, Out of whiche Ile þer cam kynges two, Ful kny?tly men, in armes desyrous— Kyng Boetes and Episterus, And with hem brou?t to Troye from so ferre A þousand kny?tes arrayed for þe werre. And fro þe lond callid Pafogonye, Whiche seuerid is from al companye, As bokis seyn þat ben historial, Vnder þe plage þat is oriental Set so fer, as made is rehersaille, Þat fewe or noon to þat lond trauaille, For þer to come is almost impossible, For whiche þat lond is callid Invisible, Be-cause only of his remocioun; And ?it it is a riche regioun, Of gold &amp; siluer also, and of stonys, And habondaunt of plente for þe nonys, It is so ful of tresour and of good, And hath his syyt on þe riche flood I-namyd Tygre, nat fer from Eufrates, As seith myn auctor, þat callid is Dares— Fro whiche lond, in stel armyd clene, A þousand kny?tes cam with Philymene, Þe worþi kyng, whos scheldis, out of drede, Wern of querboyl, in Guydo as I rede, With gold depeint &amp; fret with stonys riche, Þat in þis world I trowe wer non liche, Out of þe flodis chose be devis, Whiche han her cours out of paradys— Þe whiche kyng, a geaunte of stature, And of makyng passyng al mesure, Strong and deliuere also, as I fynde. And fro þe lond þat marchiþ vp-on Ynde, Kyng Porses cam with many kny?tly man; And he also, þat with his hond hym wan So moche honour, þe noble Meryon, And his brother callid Sygamon, Whiche from þe lond of her subieccioun, Of dukis, erlis, &amp; kny?tes of renoun, Þre þousand brou?t, alle in platis schene, With speris rounde, whet ful square &amp; kene— From Ethiopie cam þis noble route. And fro þe kyngdam also, out of doute, Þat Teremo of Dares callid is, Cam þe kyng, ful prudent &amp; ful wis, Þe manly man namyd Theseus, And eke his sone þat hi?t Archilagus, A þousand kny?tes in her companye; And Theseus ful ny?e was of alye To Priamus, by discent of blood. And kynges tweyne, passynge riche of good, And renomyd of kny?thod as be fame— Al-be þat Guydo rehersiþ nat hir name— ?et in þis story he makiþ mencioun, Þat from Agresta, þe litel Regioun, A þousand kny?tes þei brou?t vn-to Troye, Grekis pride to daunten and acoye; For þei wer chose &amp; piked for þe nonys. And from þe lond be-?onde Ama?onys, Lissynya, þe kyng Epistrophus, So wys, so worþi, and inly vertuous, Passynge of counseil and discreccioun, And with al þis, ful worþi of renoun He preved was also, in special, And in þe artis callid liberal He lernyd was, and expert a-ri?t, Nat-withstondyng he was a worþi kny?t, In werre &amp; pes manful &amp; ri?t sage, Al-be þat he was ronne fer in age— And as þe stori makeþ rehersaille, A þousand kny?tes clad in plate &amp; mail, To Troye toun, I fynde, þat he ladde; And with hym, Guydo seith, he hadde A wonder archer, of si?t merueilous, Of forme &amp; schap in maner monstruous: For lik myn auctor as I reherse can, Fro þe nauele vpward he was man, And lower doun lik an hors y-schapid; And þilke parte þat after man was makid, Of skyn was blak &amp; rowe as eny bere, Couerid with here from colde hym for to were, Passynge foul and horrible of si?t, Whos eyen were spark[e]ling as bri?t As a fourneis with his rede leuene, Or þe li?tnyng þat comeþ doun fro heuene, Dredful of loke, and red as fire of chere. And, as I rede, he was a good archere; And with his bowe, boþe at eue &amp; morwe, Vp-on Grekis he wrou?t moche sorwe, And gasted hem with many hidous loke, So sterne he was þat many of hem quoke Whan þei hym saw, so ogly &amp; horrible, And more lothsom þan it is credible, Þat many on hath wonded to þe deth, And caused hem to ?elden vp þe breth On Grekis side, as ?e schal after here. And in þis wyse assemblid ben y-fere Kynges, dukis, and erlis of renoun, From sondri londis with-Inne Troye toun, Þat be gadred &amp; come fro so ferre, As seith Dares, to helpe hem in þis werre— Þat wer in noumbre, as he maketh mynde, Two and þritty þousand, as I fynde, Of worþi kny?tes and lordis of estate, Þat sith þe worlde was formyd &amp; creat, Ne was nat seyn, I trowe, in o cite To-gidre assemblid of so hi?e degre, Nor of kny?tes so gret a multitude. And ?it þis Dares, sothly to conclude, In his boke maketh of hem no mynde, Þat cam to Troye out of smaller Ynde, Nouþer of hem, most famus of renoun, Þat wer with Priam born of Troye toun— Þat finally, ?if it be trewly sou?t, Siþen þe hour þat þis world was wrou?t, I dar afferme, vndir Phebus spere So many worþi wer nat met I-fere Of manly men, flouryng in lustines, So fresche, so ?onge, and as by liklynes, In euery point, of schap and of array For to do wel, sothly þis no nay, Who list considere vp-on ouþer side. For þoru? þe world, wher men go or ride, Þe flour of kny?thod &amp; of worþines, Of chiualrie, and of hi?e prowes Assemblid was with-outen &amp; with-Inne, Fully assentid a werre to be-gynne. Wherfore, ?e listers, taketh now good hede, Þat ?ow delite in þis boke to rede: First for how litel [þat] þis werre gan, How li?t þe cause, for whiche so many man Hath lost his lif in meschef pitously; And ?it no man can be war þer-by— Almost for nou?t was þis strif be-gonne: And who list loke, þei han no þing wonne But only deth, allas, þe harde stounde! So many kny?t cau?t his deþes wounde Wiþ-oute recure or any remedie. And for a woman, ?if I schal nat lye, Gan al þis strif, it was þe more pite, Þat so gret meschef or aduersite Of mortal slau?ter euer schulde tyde! Bet had ben to haue set a-side Swiche quarellis, dere I-now amyte, To haue lete passid or þe vengaunce bite: For wisdam wer to cast a-forn and se ?if swiche sclaundris my?t eschewed be Or þe venym gonne for to ripe; For þow[?] þat men with hornys blowe &amp; pipe Whan an hous is fired in his hete, Of þe sparkle to late is to trete, Þat causid al: wherfore, at þe gynnyng Þe remedie is put of euery þing, As euery wi?t may deme in his resoun. Howe the worthy kynge Pallamydes, the secunde parsone of þe Grekes, kame with thirtye shippes to Thenedone, in helpynge of the Grekes. And howe þe famous manful knyght, Dyomede, provokede them to departe fro Thenadon, and to Arryve in þe playne afore Troye. And whil þe Grekis lay at Tenedoun, Hem to refresche &amp; to reste in pes, Þe worþi kyng, callid Palamydes, Wiþ þritti schipes out of Grekis lond, Stuffid with kny?tes, ful worþi of her hond, Þe beste chose of al his regioun, Arived is vp at Tenedoun. Wher-of Grekis whan þei hadde a si?t, Reioyschyng hem, wer ri?t glad &amp; li?t, Havyng rewarde [vn-]to his worþines, Where þei a-forn hadde had heuynes For his absence þat he was so longe; And some of hem grucchid at him strong, For he nat kepte his moustre at Athene. But for to schewe þat he was al clene Of any spot in his conscience, Ful manfully, in open audience, Liche a kny?t he gan hym silf excuse, Stoppyng alle þo þat þer-on list to muse, Of his absence schewyng þe cause whi, Þat for siknes and sodeyn maladie He was constreyned his presence to withdrawe. And for þei sawe þat siknes haþ no lawe, Þei hilde excused fully his absence; And for he was of most reuerence, Among Grekis to no wi?t þe secounde, And was also ful wys &amp; eke habounde Of gold and good, avise &amp; prudent, Þat what-so-euere he set on his entent, Kny?tly &amp; wysly he wolde it wel acheue, And what he gan he ne wolde leue, Maugre his foon, in no maner wyse, Til þat he sawe a fyn of his emprise, And for he was most of oppinioun Amongis Grekis, and reputacioun, Þei hym besou?t þat he wold[e] be Of her conseil, avisely to se What wer to do in euery maner þing. And he assenteth vn-to her axyng, Benygnely of his gentilles. And Grekis þan dide her besynes To procede, with-oute more delay, Hem to enhaste, in al þat euer þei may, To gynne a sege and differre it nou?t. And sondri weies þei cerched han &amp; sou?t In her wittes, how fro Tenedoun Þei may remewe towarde Troye toun, From þe hauene wher her schippes be. And somme þou?t most comodite, For most expleit, be ni?t priuely Toward Troye, þat stod fast[e] by, Proudly to saille with her schipes alle. And somme seide, gret peril my?t[e] falle, Toward ni?t for to take þe se, List with dirknes þei ennoysed be In her passage, knowyng not þe way, Wher-of gret harme after falle may— And þus diuers of oppinioun, Procedyng nat to no conclusioun: For in effect her purpos nat ne held, But stille lyn, ay loggid in þe felde, Like as þei had entriked be with drede, Til on a day, worþi Dyomede, Of þe Grekis seyng þe cowardyse, Euene þus his conseil gan deuyse: “Sirs,” quod he, “þat be now here present, ?if þat ?e list, alle be oon assent, Goodly considre, aduertyng prudently What I schal seyn to-fore ?ow openly, Whiche of kny?thod han so noble a name, Sothly me semeth, we ou?ten han gret schame, Whiche holde oure silfe so my?ti &amp; so strong, And in þis lond soiourned han so longe— Ni?e al þis ?ere—and dursten in no wyse Remewen hens, for verray cowardyse— What haue we do?—nat ellis certeynly, But to oure foon graunted folily, Euene at her lust, space &amp; liberte To make hem strong, and oportunyte Vs to withstond, pleinly, at þe hond— And so þei wiln, ?e may wel vndirstond. For day be day, to oure confusioun, Þay haue sou?t wayes, ful wisly vp &amp; doun, To gete hem help in þe mene space, And hem enforced aboute in euery place, Her round cite with barreis &amp; with palis, Her wallis maskued, and ageyn oure skalis— Trusteþ þer-on—made gret ordinaunce. And with al þis, of oure gouernaunce Þei han espied, seyng þat for drede We han noon hert manly to procede In oure purpous to hold with hem werre; And ay þe more þei se þat we differre, Þe more þei wiln cacchen hardynes Vs to resiste with al her besines. Also I se, and trust it verrailly, Þat ?if we had afore-hand manfully, As we began, kny?tly furþe contunyd, Oure Iourne hadde better be fortunyd: ?if sodeynly with strong &amp; my?ti honde, Þei vnavised, we had in-to her londe With-oute abood afore þis tyme ariued, Of whiche [a] while we must be depriued And delaied, where first with victorie, To oure honour, with þe palme of glorie We my?t sothly, nad[de] ben oure slouþe, Our wil complisched, þis þe pleyn[e] trouþe: Wher maugre vs, or we to lond aryue, With strong diffence þei wil ageyn vs striue, And put vs of or we þe stronde wynne. For ay þe more we tarie to be-gynne, Þe more, in soth, for me list nat lye, We put oure silfe echon in iupartye— What schulde I feyn or fage fro þe trouþe? For oure tariyng &amp; oure coward slouþe Ar likly after to tourne vs to gret sorwe: Wherfor, erly to-morwe by þe morwe, My conseil is, oure ankres vp to pulle, In þis mater no lenger þat we dulle, But to enarme oure schipes for þe werre; And at þe vprist of þe morwe sterre, Late vs ordeyn, with kny?tly apparaille Out of þis hauene with þe wynde to saile, Of manful hert &amp; lusti fresche corage, Our cours holdyng &amp; our ri?t passage Toward Troye, &amp; londen horpidly, What-euere falle: for trusteþ sikerly, With-out skarmusche we may nat ariue; For þei fro Troye descende wil as blyue, Lik manly men, to mete vs in þe berde. But for al þat, lat vs nat ben a-ferde, But voide drede, &amp; manhod set a-fore, Þat cowardyse entre at no bore For to astone þe manhod of oure herte.” And with þat word, þe Grekis gan aduerte Þe manly conseil of þis Diamede, And in effect to procede in dede Vn-to þe point, &amp; for no þing spare, And in what wyse, anoon I schal declare. Howe the Grekes londede in the playne afor [Troye], and howe the Troyans gave theme batayle at the stronde: in whos meteynge were slayne mony A worthy knygh[t] and others. The next[e] morwe, wonderly be-tyme, Or Phebus vprist, longe or it was prime, Whan it be-gan ful merily to dawe, Þe Grekis host to schipward gonne drawe With manly hert, fully deuoyde of drede, Only þoru? comfort of þis Diomede. But aldirfirst, anoon as þei a-wake, Þe lordis wysely han her counseil take And concludid among hem euerychon, Whiche of her schipes schuld[e] formest gon, And on þe se howe þei schulde hem guye, So to ariue þat no man hem espie: Þis was deuised at a certeyn marke. Þe ny?t passid, at singyng of þe larke, Grekis be schippid with-out more tariyng, Boþe hi?e and low, in [þe] daw[e]nyng; And first a-forne, an hundrid schipes of tour, Stuffid with many worþi werriour, Gan proudly saille, as þei had in charge; And þe baners, brode, bri?t, and large, Were splaied out vp-on euery side: And þei departe þe fomy wawes wyde, Þat to si?t whelmen vp so grene. And next [to] hem, for werre enarmyd clene, A-noþer hundrid folwe fast[e] by, Whiche bare her sailles passingly proudly, In whiche þer was ful many worþi kny?t, Armyd in mail &amp; in platis bri?t. And after folweþ hoolly her nauye, Þat as I trowe, swiche a companye Of worþi kny?tes &amp; lordis of degre Was neuer a-forne seyn vp-on þe se. And Eolus was to hem fortunat; And eke Neptune made no debat With wynde nor trouble among þe [sterne] wawis; Þatempre wedir ful mery to hem dawes, Þat in a tyde, as þei seille ri?t, Of Troye toun þei cau?t anoon a si?t, Wher-of in hert ful glad &amp; li?t þei ben. But whan Troyans first her schippes sen So proudly saille a litel fro þe stronde, And sawe how þei cast hem for to lond, Þei bood no more, but arme hem hastily In plate and mail &amp; Iakkis richely, With Irous hert—and þat was don anon— And toke her hors, &amp; forþe in hast þei goon Out at þe ?atis &amp; made no tariyng: For þei nabide prince, duke, nor kyng, Nor oþer lord to guye hem or gouerne, But hast hem forþe, so many and so ?erne, Þoru?-oute þe felde so gret a multitude. Amongis whom were no folkis rude, But manly men, &amp; þriftily beseyn, So clenly armyd on þe large pleyn, Þat whan Grekis gan hem first beholde, Of þe noumbre her hert[e] gan to colde: For þer was noon so manly hem amonge, So ?ong, so fresche, so hardy, nor so strong, Of hi?e estat nor of lowe degre, Þat he ne was astonied for to se Þe hardy Troyans so proudly doun descende To lette Grekis þat þei nat ascende, Þat þei wist and conceive outterly Þer was no mene to arive by, But only deth, or manly for to fi?t, Or cowardly take hem to þe fli?t— For oþer conduit pleinly noon þer was But scharp[e] swerdis &amp; speris in þis cas. Til sodeinly þe hardy ferse kyng, Protheselaus, whiche in his gouernyng, Formest of alle, an hundrid schipes ladde, Gan hasten hym for Ire þat he hadde, Talondid first, ?if it wold haue be, Ta met with hem so gret desire had he. But swyche a wynde gan in þe seil[e] driue Of his schipis, whan he schope tariue, Þat he vnwarly smet vp-on þe londe, On þe gettis and þe drye sonde, Þat his schippes schyuered al a-sondre, And some dreint, to-broken here &amp; ?ondre, And deuourid of þe wawy se, Þat it was rouþe and pite for to se— For but of harde þer my?te noon eskape. And whiles some wer besy for to take Þe drie lond, with mvd and filþe y-lade, Troyens of hem ful cruel slau?ter made; Maugre her my?t, Grekis so constreyned, Þat with her blood þe wawis wer [y-]steyned, So mortally, þat sothly to be-holde, Amonge þe sonde, pale, ded, and colde Þe Grekis lyn, with woundis fresche &amp; grene; And al þe eyr with schot of arowis kene I-schadwed was, þat Phebus bemys bri?t Vp-on þe soille was dirked of his li?t. And new alwey Troyens hem assaille, Þat to Grekis pleinly þis ryvaille So mortal was &amp; so infortunat, So vnwelful and disconsolat, So vndisposid þoru? infelicite, Þat, I trowe, neuere out of no se Ne cam noon host of mor harde to londe. But for al þat, Grekis nolde wonde, For lyf nor deth, manly to arive. And so befil, of auenture as blyue, Þe hundrid schipes þat next aftir sew, Avisely, and in tyme dew Ben entrid in, and hast[e] nat to faste, And strike sail and her ankris caste, For þe werre strongly enbatailled, In her londyng list þei wern assailled. And wisly first þei sette her arblasteris And her gonners &amp; her best archeris, With pauiseris for to goon aforn, Kny?tly to londe, þou? Troyens had sworn Þe contrarie, proudly hem to lette; ?et for al þat, fersly vp þei sette. The Grekysshe schot made hem to with-drawe, And many of hem on þe lond ley slawe, Þat maugre hem þe stronde þei recure; And swiche as my?t most manfully endure Wer set aforn, til þei þe lond han take. And al attonys swiche assaut þei make Vp-on Troyens; and þo be-gan þe fi?t, Whan Prothesilaus, þe noble worþi kny?t, Wonder lifly &amp; ri?t passyng strong, With þe Grekis entrid in among Þe hardy Troyens, &amp; euer[y]-wher hem sou?t; For he of armes merueilles on hem wrou?t Þilke day þoru? his worþines, Þat many Troyan he brou?t in distresse— Wher he went þei felt[e] ful vnsofte, Þoru? whos manhod Grekis wern a-lofte. For þilke day, ne hadde his kny?thood be, Þe Grekis hadde in gret aduersite Be venquisched by fatal puruyaunce, And fynally brou?t vn-to vttraunce, I-putte a-bak, pleinly þis no lye. But what availleþ al his chiualrie, His worþines, or his fers corage— What my?t it helpe or do avauntage, Sith seuene þousand Grekis had a-do With an hundrid þousand Troyens &amp; ?it mo! It merueil was how þei my?t endure In any wyse þe stronde to recure, Or so fewe [for] to holde a felde. But in hem silf o þing þei behelde, Ful prudently, whiche þat ?aue hem hert; Þat þei saw þei my?t[e] nat asterte To eskape alyue ?if þei wolde fle: For at her bak was no þing but þe se, And to-forn hem an host so gret &amp; huge Þat oþir way was þer no refuge, But deye attonys or fi?t manfully. Wherfor þei caste &amp; schope hem ful kny?tly, Lik manly men, her lyues to iuparte Þan cowardly from her foon departe, To lese her grounde &amp; drenchyn in þe se. And þus as long as it wolde be, Grekis diffende hem fer aboue her my?t, Al-be þat many wer kylled in þis fi?t, Þat þe stremys of þe rede blood Ran on þe sonde, large as any flood, So cruelly Troyens on hem sette With spere and swerde, [ful] scharp[e] grounde &amp; whet, Þat rouþe was and pite for to þinke, Til þei almost drof hem to þe brinke, Wher þe Grekis, in meschef &amp; distresse, In gret anguysch &amp; passyng werines Hem silfe diffende, maat &amp; ful wery, Wher þei schulde haue perschid outerly, Recurles, in soth, for euermore, Nadde Archelaus and worþi Prothenor From her schipes aryued vn-to londe, Of sodeyn hap with hem for to stonde. And ?it þei had ful gret aduersite For to ariue, þoru? þe cruelte Of þe Troyens; but ?it þe lond þei wynne. And Grekis þan cruelly be-gynne Ageyn her foon to stonden at diffence With manly force and gret violence; And þo encreseth þe blody werre newe, Þat al þe soil depeynt was with þe hewe, Þat first was grene, turned in-to red, On eche side so many on lay ded Vp-on þe grounde, of his lif depriued. But duke Nestor is sodeynly aryued With his kny?tes, felle and ful Irous, And of hert ri?t malencolyous, With his speris, archeris oute a-syde, He entrid in, sterne &amp; ful of pride. With swerd and axe, grounde scharpe &amp; kene, Þei ran y-fere &amp; mette vp-on þe grene; And hokid arowis alwey flen among, And schaftis schiuere, to-braste, &amp; torne wrong; And with her tolys, stelyd &amp; wel whet, Þe long[e] day þei han to-gidre met. And þe slau?ter new alwey began, On euery half, of many worþi man, With woundys large, fel, &amp; dispitous: For Prothenor and kyng Archelaus With swerdis stif among þe rengis kerue, Whiche many Troyan made for to sterue— Þei were þat day so passyng[ly] Irous, And hem to auenge inly desyrous, Neuer cessyng in her pursewyng. And to releue hem, Alagus þe kyng I-londid is, and eke kyng Athalus, Whiche on Troyens werne ful envious, Brennyng of Ire as þe fyry glede, And vp-on hem, of verray olde hattrede, With her kny?tes sodeinly be falle; And in her Ire, bitterer þan galle, Cruelly þei her foon oppresse, And of assent dide her besines Maugre hem bakward to resort Amyd þe feld, as I can report— Þer was no choys, so þei wer constreyned Of verray force, &amp; of manhod peyned To withdrawe, to her confusioun. Here were faste devyces founde in Armes. But þanne in hast, doun fro Troye toun, Of worþi kny?tes freschely armyd new, With diuises of many sondri hewe, With-out abood, schortly to conclude, Þer cam doun so gret a multitude, Eche his armys depeint vp-on his schelde, Þat in her comyng gletereth al þe felde Of her armwre and þe sonne bri?t; And whan þat þei wer entrid in-to fi?t, Grekis metyng, felly be envie, Þei set vp-on, fret wiþ malencolie, With swiche a wille, of hert[e] an[d] corage, Wiþ swiche furie in her mortal rage, Þat vntacord was noon oþer mene, But slau?tre and deth hem to go betwene, Þoru? strok of axe, of dagger, &amp; of spere, Þat of force coact þe Grekis were To retourne bakward to þe stronde. To whos rescus anoon þer cam to londe Þe kyng Vlixes with his hool navie, And ful kny?tly, with his chiualrie, Towardis Troyens enhasteþ him anoon; And of on herte þe Grekis with him goon, And her corage hooly þei reswme, And gan her foon felly to conswme Vn-to þe deth, her damage to revenge, Þat no wi?t may iustly hem chalenge Of vnmanhod, so wel þei han hem born, To quite ageyn her harmys do be-forn. At whiche tyme, lik a ferse lyoun Among[es] Troyens renging vp and doun, Vlixes went with his swerde in honde: He kylleth, sleth, &amp; kny?tly gan to fonde, Þilk[e] day lyk a man be founde; And her &amp; þer, with many mortal wounde, Vp-on Troyens he wrou?t al þis wrak, Hem beryng doun on fote and hors[e]-bak, In his Ire his strokis wer so kene. At whiche tyme worþi Philomene, Lord &amp; kyng of Pafogonye, Whan he behild, wiþ his companye, So many Troyan of Vlixes slawe, Towardis hym anon he gan him drawe On hors[e]-bak, with a spere rounde, Out of his sadil bar hym to þe grounde; But Vlixes ros vp anon ri?t, Takyng his hors, lik a manly kny?t; Þe whiche anon as Philomene haþ seyn, Toke eft a spere and rod to hym ageyn So my?tely, and with swiche violence, Þat finally þer geyneth no diffence, But þat he smet him evene þoru? þe scheld, þe whiche fley a-sondre in þe feld; And þoru? his platis, with-outen any fail, Þe sperehed ran, &amp; rested in þe mail, Þat forged was of steel ful schene &amp; bri?t, Whiche to perce þe sperehed had no my?t, So trewly made was þe haberioun; But with þat strok Vlixes was bore doun ?et eft ageyn; but he vp ros anon, Whiche of his stroke harme ne felt[e] non, And rau?t a spere, scharp[e] whet &amp; grounde, And Philomene he ?af swiche a wounde, With al þe my?t of his armys tweyne, Of Irous herte, with so gret a peyne, Þat þoru? his schelde, boþe plate &amp; mail, He smet hym vp þoru? his aventail, In-to þe gorge þat þe strok gan glide, Þat from his hors he fil doun a-side, Ful perlously pi?te vp-on his hed, His kny?tes wenyng sothly he were ded. Whiche toke hym vp &amp; leyde him on a scheld, And bar him hom in hast out of þe feld, With gret daunger or þei my?t hym wynne, Þoru? þe Grekis with her lord to twynne. And for Troyens supposid sykerly Þat Philomene, with-oute remedye, Had be ded, þei wer astonyed alle: Þat ?if þis cas þat day nad[de] falle Of Philomene, Grekis on þe stronde Hadde be outtraied, ariving vp to londe, Þoru? þe kny?thod—þis is dout[e]les— Of Philomene, whom þat Vlixes Vnhorsed hath with a mortal wounde, In kny?tly wyse Troyens to confounde— Wher-of þei wer astonyd euerychon. But Thoas þanne and Agamenoun, Of Grekis host lord &amp; Emperour, Ariued is vn-to her socour Wiþ al his kny?tes, and Menelaus, And eke þe worþi Thelamonyus, Callid Aiax, is to lond[e] come; And þei at leyser han her hors [y-]nome, While oþer Grekis Troyens occupie, So[re] fi?tyng, and þei gan fast[e] hye Toward[es] hem, makyng no delay; Al on a frussche, in al þe hast þei may, Þei ran y-fere and her speris brak, With herte envious, vp-on hors[e]-bak. Þer my?t[e] men þe worþi kny?tes se On her stedis eche at oþer flee With stif swerdis, schaftis gret &amp; rounde, With hedis square, þe pointis kene grounde— Þer my?t[e] men, in her furious tene, Se many kny?tes ded vp-on þe grene! But most þe slau?ter and confusioun Fil þilk[e] tyme of hem of þe toun: Þe Grekis wern so my?ti &amp; so strong. And in þe feld þis contvneth long, Til Prothesilaus, þe strong my?ti kyng, Whiche al þe day in skarmusche &amp; fi?tyng Ful lik a kyn?t had occupied be Ageyn[e]s Troyens, in his cruelte, Of manhod only and of wo[r]þines, Of auenture, in his werynes Hym to refresche &amp; to taken eyr, And to abreth hym, makyd his repeir To þe stronde, where he dide ariue: Wher as him þou?t, his hert[e] gan to ryue Of cruel Ire and also of pite, Þat he kau?t, only for to se His men lyn slayn endelong þe stronde, And some of hem comynge vp to londe, Dreint in þe se among þe flodis depe. For whiche þing he gan anoon to wepe Ful pitously, al wer it nat espied, Whos woful eyne my?t[e] nat be dreyed For þe constreynt which sat so ny?e his hert. Til at þe last, among his peynys smert, So cruel Ire gan his hert enbrace, Þat sodeynly with a dispitous face, With-out abood, þou?t[e] how þat he Vp-on her deth wolde avengid be, Or finally attonis with hem deye. And on his stede he toke þe ri?t[e] weye Toward his foon, ful Irous in his rage; And lyne ri?t he holdiþ his passage, Swift as grehond þat renneþ oute of lees; And where he saw þat þer was grettest pres, He preseþ þoru?, amiddis of þe feld; And with þe swerd whiche in his hond he held, Þat ground[e] was to keruen and to bite, Ful mortally a-boute hym he gan smyte, Þat Troyens my?t hym not asterte. Some he riveth evene to þe herte, And some he woundeth, sothly, to þe deth, And some he made to ?elden vp þe breth, And he vnhorseþ somme cruelly; And whom he mette þat day, outterly, From his hors he made hym to aly?te: For where he rood þei fled out of his si?t, And his presence as þe deth eschewe; But euere in on, he gan aftir sewe In his chaas, as a wood lyoun. Þis pley he pleyeth with hem of þe toun, Til Perseus, of Ethiope kyng, From þe cite com sodeinly ridyng Wiþ many kny?t &amp; many lifly man; At whos comyng of new[e] þer be-gan A fresche skarmusch, furious &amp; wood, Þat many Greke þat day lost his blood, So fel assaut Troyens on hem make. And among hem þe Ethiopes blake So manly bar hem, fi?tyng here &amp; þere, Þat wher Troyens wern a-forn in fere, Remounted ben and of new assurid; Þat þoru? her help þei han þe feld recurid, And made hem lese also moche ageyn As þei to-forn wonnen on þe pleyn: For þei so hool &amp; so my?tily Kept hem to-gidre, and so avisely Gouerned hem, with pavis, spere, and schelde, Þat Grekis werne compelled in þe felde, Maugre who gruccheþ, of necessite, To þe stronde bakward for to flee, Almost dispeired, maat and confortles. But in þat while, kyng Palamydes To her rescus cam to a-ryvaille, And lusty fresche entriþ in bataille Wiþ his kny?tes &amp; his hool meyne, Takyng her hors fast[e] by þe se; And ful proudly enbusched al attonys, With spere &amp; swerd grounde for þe nonys, By conveying of her worþi kyng, Han so oppressid at her in-comyng Þe manly Troyens, þat it was a wondre To sen hem lyn, slay[e]n here and ?ondre. And þis contuneþ til among þe pres Of auenture þat Pallamydes, Brennyng ay in his furious hete, Amid þe feld happeþ for to mete A worþi kny?t callyd Sygamoun, Whiche broþer was to [þe] kyng Menoun, Nevew also, as Guydo doth reherse, Þis manly man, to þe kyng of Perse, Whiche Grekis had þat day sore oppresed By his kny?thod, as it is expresid: For he Grekis by his worþines Had ofte brou?t in ful gret distres Þe same day, to his grete encres. But of fortune, allas, Pallamydes, As I ?ow told, hath in þe feld hym met, And with a spere, square &amp; scharp[e] whette, Whan he of kny?thod was most in his pride, He rood at hym &amp; smet him þoru? þe syde. And with þat last dedly fatal wounde, From his stede he bare hym to þe grounde; And on þe pleyn, of his blood al red, Pallamydes lefte hym pale and ded, Amongis hem þat of Troye were; And furþe he rood, &amp; bare doun here &amp; þere Al þat euere in his weye stood— He was on hem so furious &amp; wood— Maugre Troyens to-forn him on þe pleyn, Made resorte to þe wal ageyn, His manly kny?tes, alwey fast[e] by, On his awaytyng ful en[ten]tifly Redy to hond at euery gret emprise. But þo began þe noise to arise, Þe woful clamour and þe pitus crie Of hem of Troye, þe whiche outterly Ageyn[es] Grekis my?t[e] nat sustene; Þe mortal swerd was so scharp &amp; kene Of þe noble worþi famous kny?t, Pallamydes, þat with his gret my?t Þe long[e] day hath y-born hym so Ageyn his foon, and so kny?tly do, In his persone, þoru? his hie renoun, [Þat] Chased hath almost to þe toun Troyens echon, manly made to fle. Þe noise of whom is entrid þe cite, Þe hidous crie and þe mortal schout, Wher-of amevid, Hector isseth out Furiously, in al þe hast he can, Þe sone of Mars, þis kny?t, þis manly man, Of alle worþi ?it þe worþiest Þat euere was, and þe hardiest. For as Phebus with his bemys clere Amonge sterris, so dide he appere, Excellyng all in stel armyd bri?t, On whom it was a verray heuenly si?t: For it was he, þat, boþe ny?e &amp; ferre, Of worþines was þe lode-sterre. Þe whiche whan he entrid in-to feld, Liche as I rede, bare þat day a schelde, Þe feld of whiche was of purid gold With þre lyouns, in story as is told, Of whos colour is made no mencioun; But, as I fynde by discripcioun, Þei wer passaunt, ?if I report ari?t, Born on þe brest of þis Troyan kni?t, Þat was þe ground &amp; rote of hi?e prowes And flour acounted of al worþines. Þe whiche so manly, with-out more abood, Amongis his kny?tes to þe Grekis rood, So like a man, þat þei in his comyng Astonyd wern, as he gan in þring Amonges hem, whiche killeth doun &amp; sleth, And whom he mette þer was nat but deth. A-forn his swerd Grekis go to wrak; And her wardis of kny?tly force he brak, And maugre hem seuered hem assondre, And bare al doun, ridyng here and ?ondre. And casuelly he meteth in his way Prothesilaus, whiche al þe longe day Had sore fou?te ageynes hem of Troy And slaw alle [þo] þat come in his woye, Þis hardy kny?t, þis worþi, ferse kyng, Whiche on Troyens was euer purswyng— He to hem had so hertly gret envye. Þe whiche þing whan Hector gan espie, And of his kny?thod gan to taken hed, Towardis hym he gan to reyne his stede; And lyne ri?t of hasty Ire he rood, And with his swerd, disteyned al with blod, He rof his hed, þoru? his bas[e]net, With swiche a my?t þat his strok nas let By force of maille nor of þikke plate: But finally, by ful mortal fate, Þe swerd of Hector, þoru? nerf, bon, &amp; veyne, Þis worþi kyng parted haþ on tueyne; For outterly, þer geyneth noon armvre Ageyn þe strok of Hector to endure— But þat þis kyng, so ful of worþines, Strong &amp; my?ty, and of gret hardines, Receyved hath his last[e] fatal wounde, And lith now ded, parted on þe grounde. And Hector furthe among þe Grekis ryt; And who-so-euer þat his strok abit, Refute was non nor diffence but deth; And many Greke þilke day he slethe: For whiche of hem in his wey[e] stood, His scharp[e] swerd he baþid in his blood, Þat also fer as þei my?t hym se, As þe deth, from his swerd þei fle— So mortal vengaunce up-on hem he wro?t. And many Greke at his felaw sou?t, And gan enquere what he my?t[e] be; For al her lyue þei koude neuer se Non so kny?tly haue hym in bataile, And pleynly dempte, as be supposaile, It was Hector, þe noble werriour, Whiche of kny?thod may bere aweye þe flour Among alle þat euer ?it were born: For þer nas Greke þat hym may stond a-forn; Of alle þat day he gan hem so enchase To þe strond, euene a-form his face— For þei ne durst his mortal st[r]ook abide. And whan he had vppon euery syde Þe Grekis chacid to þe wawy se, Wounded &amp; maat, in gret aduersite, Þan hym to rest, þis Troyan kny?t anon, Lik Mars him silf, hom to Troy is goon. At whos partyng, Grekis eft preswme Manly a-geyn her hertis to reswme, And of newe her fomen for to assaille, And to iupart, ?if it wolde availle, Lif &amp; deth to setten at outtraunce On Fortune, ?if sche wolde avaunce Her part ageyn in recure of þe felde, And hem enforce, with my?t of spere &amp; scheld, To wynne ageyn on Troyens, ?if þei may, Anon forþe-with, and make no delay. For hei?t[e] tyme sithen þei be-gonne Þe feld þei han þat day lost &amp; wonne, Lyke as Fortune list to don hir cure, Vp or down for to turne hir ewre: For as hir whele went aboute rounde, Ri?t so þat day þei wan &amp; lost her grounde. But specialy þei wer most dismaied Whan Hector cam, whiche haþ hem so outra[i]ed Þoru? his kny?thod, whiche made her hertis riue, And to resorte where þei dide aryue. And þis contuneth, maugre al her my?t, While in þe feld was þis Troyan kny?t, Til Phebus chare gan to westre doun, Þat he repeyred is in-to þe toun, Whiche hadde Grekis wrou?t aforn ful ille. But nowe þe hardy, cruel, ferse Achille Ariued is with his kny?tes alle, Mirundones whom men are wont to calle, Whiche from þe se takyn han þe pleyn. At whos commyng Grekis han a-geyn Þe feld recured, &amp; put hem silf in pres, Only þoru? helpe of hardy Achilles, Whiche is so felly Troyens falle vppon, Þat he of hem hath slayn many on: For þre þowsand in stel armyd bri?t With hym he brou?t, redy for to fi?t, Kny?tes echon, ful worþi of renoun, Whiche with Achille, Grekis champioun, Han merciles in her cruelte Slayn many Troyan out of þe cite. Þei wer so feruent in her mortal Ire, So envious of hate to desyre Newe &amp; newe for to schede her blood; For Achilles þou?t it dide hym good With his swerde Troyan blood to schede, And on þe soil to sen hem lyn &amp; blede, Routh[e]les in his malencolye. For he to hem hath so hoot envie, With-oute her deth þat it may nat quenche; And he his swerd ful depe made drenche Þe long[e] day in Troyanysche blood, And baþid it as it were in a flood, Whiche forgid was &amp; I-whet so kene, Þat many ryuer, sothly, on þe grene Ran her and þer of her hortis sore, And with his kny?tes, alwey more &amp; more Pursewed hem, a-forn him as þei fle To þe wallis of Troye þe cite, Wher þei made a ful pitous cry. And in þis while, I finde in þe story, Þe Grekis host holy is arived, Like in Guydo as it is descrived, Of men of armys swyche a multitude, And of kny?tes, schortly to conclude, Þat from her schipes of newe londed be, Þat Troyens astonyd wer to se; And abaisched þei gan wexen alle. For sodeynly þei gan on hem falle, On euery halfe, passyngly gret pres; And euer in on þis hardy Achilles With his swerd made her sydes rede: For her &amp; þer lay þe bodyes dede, And woundid some at entre of þe gate, And kny?tly þere with hem [he] gan debate, And furiously þis fel cruel kny?t Þe children slowe in her fadris si?t, Þat to be-holde it was ful gret pite. And ?it þe slau?ter gretter had[de] be, With-out noumbre of hem of þe toun, Perpetuelly to her confusioun, Likly for euer to haue be ouer-come, ?if Troylus nadde vn-to reskus come, ?ong, fresche, &amp; lusty, &amp; inly desyrous, With whom cam eke Paris &amp; Dephebus And many worþi her party to socure; So þat Grekis þo ne my?t endure Ageynes hem to stonden at diffence, For al her pride, no[r] make resistence, Worþi Troylus so wel þat tyme hym quitte. For þis in soth, what Greke þat he hitte, Ouþer he maymeth or he made deye: Wherfor, as deth, þei fledde out of his weye. And Achilles with his company— For it was ny?t—homward gan him hi?e Toward Grekis, with glorie &amp; gret honour; And þei reseyve hym like a conquerour, Þat he with hem hath so wel I-met; And þei of Troye han her gatis schet, And made hem strong þoru?-out al þe toun. Of the pichenge of the Grekes felde; and howe Agamenon reysid his tentes, pavelons, &amp; mansyons. And in þis tyme, king Agamenoun I-cerched hath a place couenable, Whiche hym þou?t was most agreable, Be liklihede, and most conuenient For euery lord for to sette his tent. And in a feld of ful large space, Most competent as for logging place, In due siyt sette fro þe cite, Eche lord was signed wher he schuld[e] be; And gan anon ordeyne mansiouns, Pycche her tentis and papilliouns; And swyche as my?t no tentori[e]s haue From storm &amp; reyn hem silf[e] for to saue, Þei deuised oþer habitacles, Tugurries &amp; smale receptacles To schroude hem in; &amp; al þe ny?t also, From her schipes þei had moche ado, Or þei my?t han her hors to londe, And to ordeyn wher þei schuld[e] stonde. And þei also besy were to carye Other þinges þat wer necessarie And nedefully vn-to a sege longe; And eke þei made teye her schipes strong Fer in þe depes, and her ankris caste. And of assent, þei besied hem ful fast For to conferme of on entencioun To sette a sege vn-to Troye toun, And þer-vppon, by bond assured faste, For to abide while her lyf may laste, Fynally with-oute repentaunce. And prudently þei made her ordinaunce, As þei best coude: al þe long[e] ny?t Þei bet her fryes, which brent wonder li?t; And at a space deuided fro þe fyres, Þei setten vp, in maner of barreris, And rounde aboute wher her loggyng was, Þei palyd hem al þe feld compas. And to acheue þe fyn of her purpos, Þei felly wrou?t, &amp; kept hem silf ay clos. And þe kyng, þat no tresoun falle, Lete make wache with-oute his tentis alle, Of hem þat had rested hem a-fore; And his mynstrales he made ouer-more, As seith Guydo, al þe longe ny?t To kepe her tides to-fore þe fyres bri?t, Myrely to sowne her instrumentis. And hem he made restyn in her tentis, Þat had a-forn wery ben of fy?t, And in þe se wer feinted of her my?t; And oþer eke he made in her armvre Awaite wisly ageyn al aventure, Þat no deceit wer founde on no syde. And þus þis kyng kny?tly gan prouide In his avis þat no þing hym eskape; And al þe ny?t I finde he dide wake, Til on þe morwe, þat þe rowes rede Of Phebus chare gonne for to sprede. And þus eche þing disposid as it ou?t, I wil procede to telle how þei wrou?t, Ceriously with-outyn and with-Inne, With ?oure support þe þridde [boke] be-gynne. [Explicit liber Secundus Incipit liber Tercius] PART II. BOOK III. BOOK III. Here bygynnethe the thirde boke of Troye. Howe worthy Ector devyded his batayls vpon A large playne within the Cite, and howe he put the wardis doscretly to be vnder þe ledynge of his brethere and other worthy kynges. Whan Aurora, with hir pale li?t, Vnder þe mantel of þe mirke ny?t And þe curtyn of her hewes fade I-schroudid was in þe dirk[e] schade, Abasched rody, as I can diffyne, Only of fer þat is femynyne, For a-schamyd durst[e] nat be seyn Be-cause sche had so longe a-bedde leyn With fresche Febus, hir owne chose kny?t, For whiche sche hidde hir sothly out of si?t Til his stede þat callid is Flegonte Enhasted hym aboue oure ori?onte; And Appollo with his bemys clere Hath recounforted hir oppressid chere— Þis to seyne, aftir þe dawenyng Whan Titan was in þe est rysyng, Of his hete atempre and ri?t softe Her emyspery for to glade a-lofte,— Þe same hour, þe Troyan champioun, Gouernour of werris of þe toun, Worþi Ector, whiche in þe cite Next Priam had of alle souereinte Þe toun to guye be kny?tly excellence, For his manhod and his sapience Of Troyan kny?tes lord &amp; eke chefteyn, Whiche hath commaunded, in a large pleyn, To hi?e and low, he exceptyng noon, Kynges, princes, and lordis euerychon, Þe same morwe for to mete I-fere, In hir array to moustre and appere, Like as þei were of name &amp; of estate, Besyde a temple whilom consecrate To þe goddes þat callid is Dyane, Moste honoured in þat riche fane— Þer to arraye hem, in al þe haste þei can, Lik þe devis of þis kny?tly man. And þis playn, passyng fair to se, Was sette amyd Troye þe cite, Smoþe and ri?t fair, &amp; ful of fresche floures, W[h]ere alle þe worþi noble werriours Of Troye toun to-gydre assemblid be, And many oþer to be-holde and se Þe famus kny?tes arme hem in þat place. And some of hem gan ful streite lace Her doublettis made of lyne cloth, A certeyn fold þat a-boute hem goth; And some also dempte most surest To armen hem for bataille of arest, And dide on firste, aftir her desires, Sabatouns, grevis, cusschewis, &amp; voideris— A peire breke, aldirfirst, of maille; And some þer wer eke þat nolde faille To han of maille eke a peir[e] bras, And þer-with-al, as þe custom was, A peir Gussetis on a petycote, Garnyssched with gold vp on-to the þrote, A paunce of plate, whiche of þe silf be-hinde Was schet and clos, and þer-on, as I finde, Enviroun was a bordure of smal maille. And some chose, of þe newe entaille, For to be sure myd of al her foos, An hol brest-plate with a rere-doos By-hynde schet, or ellis on þe side. And on his armys, rynged nat to wyde, Þer wer woiders frettid in þe maille, With cordis rounde, &amp; of fresche entaille, Vauntbras with wynges, &amp; rerebras þer-to, And þer-on set wer besagus also; Vp-on þe heed a basenet of stele, Þat with-Inne lokked was ful wele, A crafty si?t wrou?t in þe viser. And some wolde haue of plate a bavier, Þat on þe brest fastnyd be a-forn, Þe canel-pece more esy to be born— Gloues of plate of stele forgid bri?t. And some wold armyd be more li?t In þikke Iackys curid with satyn; And some wele haue, of maille, wrou?t ful fyn, An haberioun, al of but cassade, Þat with wei?te he be nat ouer-lade, Hym silfe to welde lik a lifly man. And some wil haue, of chose geseran, On his dublet but an haberioun, And some only but a sure gepoun Ouer his poleyns, rechyng to þe kne, And þat þe slevis eke so longe be Þat his vaunbras may be curid ner— A prikyng palet, of plate þe cower. And some wil haue also no viser To saue his face, but only a naser; And some wil haue a peir[e] platis li?t To welde hym wel, whan þat he schal fi?t. And some wiln han a target or a spere, And some a pavis, his body for to were, And some a targe, makyd strong to laste; And some wil haue dartes for to caste, Some a pollex, heueded of fyn stele, And piked square, for to laste wel; And some a swerd his enemy for to mete. And some wil haue a bow[e] for to schete, Somme an arblast, to stonden out a-syde; And some on fote and some for to ride Arraie hem silf, her fomen for to assaile; And many on was besy for to naille His felawis harneis, for to make it strong, And to dresse it, þat it sete nou?t wrong, With pointes, tresses, and oþer maner þing, Þat in swyche cas longyth to armyng. I haue no konnyng euery þing to telle, And vn-to ?ow it were to long to dwelle— Where I faile, ?e mote haue me excusid; For in swiche crafte I am litel vsid, And ignoraunce doþe my penne lette, In her ordre my termys for to sette. And oft chaungeth swiche harneis &amp; devis; And ?e þat ben þer-in experte &amp; wys, Disdeyneth nat þat I speke in þis place Of her armyng: for al is in ?our grace, Ri?t at ?our luste to correcte euerydel. And whan Ector sawe þat al was wel, And euery man armed and arrayed, Þis worþi kny?t no lenger hath delaied Avisely his wardis for to make, And prudently bad þei schuld[e] take Her grounde in haste, to put al in certeyn, And stonde in ordere endelong þe pleyn So þat no man were founde reccheles. Ector devydede his feld in-to xj wardys. And þe gate, callid Dardanydes, With-oute abood Ector made vnschette, And after bad [þat] men schuld[e] fette To his presence, þat it were don in haste, Cyncynabor, his broþer born in baste, And to hym, firste of euerychon, And to a lord þat namyd was Glaucoun, Þe kynges sone of Licye and his eyr, With many baner displeyed in þe eir— To þis two Hector gaf þe guarde And gouernaunce of þe firste warde, In whiche he hath a þousand kny?tes set, With speris rounde &amp; swerdis kene whet, And on her brest ful many riche scheld; And þei wer chose oute in al þe feld Among þe best þat endure my?t Ageyn[es] Grekis manly for to fi?t. And vn-to hem Hector bad anoon, In Goddis name, þat þei schuld[e] gon Oute at þe gate, sothly, as I rede. And list þei fel in meschef or in nede, He assigned, in þe silve place, With manly chere, to þe kyng of Trace, Wysly on hem to ben awaytyng, A þousand kny?tes to han at his ledyng, In a wyng kny?tly for to a-bide, To awaite on hem vp-on euery side. And with hym was his sone Achilogus, Of his age a man ri?t vertuous To fulfille þat longeth to a kny?t; For boþe he had, hert &amp; also my?t. And next to hem, Hector gan devise Þe nexte warde to þe kyng of Fryse, In his tyme callid ?antipus; And vn-to hym, ?ong, strong, &amp; desyrous, He assigned, to [a]waite on his baner, Þre þousand kny?tes armyd bri?t and cler. With whiche warde kyng Althomus also Of Hector was commaundid for to go, And to his byddyng he mekely dide obeie. And ful kny?tly þei han take her weye Oute at þe ?ate, passyngly arrayed, Toward Grekis with baneris fresche displaied, And her penouns vnrollid euerychon. And after, Hector assigned hath anon To þe noble, ?ong[e], lusty, fre, His broþer Troylus, so fresche vp-on to se, Whiche in kny?thod had al suffisaunce, Þe þridde warde to haue in gouernaunce With þre þousand kny?tes, ?ong of age, Flourynge in force, hardy of corage, Swiche as he was of custom wont to lede. To whom Hector of verray broþerhede Ful goodly seide at his departyng: “Broþer,” quod he, “myn herte is so lovyng Towardis þe of verray kyndenes, Þat þou?e I haue in party gret gladnes Of þi manhod, þat so fer is kouth, And þe kny?thod of þi grene ?outhe, ?it dout[e]les, in my fantasie, Ful oft a-day I stonde in iuparte, Of pensifhed and inward besy drede, Whan I remembre vppon þi manhede, Liste þi corage be to violent, Of þi lif to be to necligent, Þi silfe to put to fer in auenture, Of surquidie so moche for tassure, In þi force kny?tly to asterte Euery pereil in þi manful herte, Hauyng no reward, in swiche mortal strife, Of wilfulnes, nouþer to deth nor life, Nor aduertence to þi sauacioun. But as Fortune turneth vp &amp; doun Her whel mevable, hi?e and aftir lowe, In Martis Ire as þe wynde doþe blowe, Whiche causeth me ful ofte si?e and þinke, And to wake whan I schuld[e] wynke, Reuoluyng ay þin hasty wilfulnes: But, gentil broþer, for any hardynes, Þis ilke day, vppon euery side, I praie þe so wysly to prouide, For hate or Ire, þi foos purswyng, Nat to excede more þanne is sittyng; But late prudence kepe þe in a mene, And wisdam eke holden a?en þe rene Of þin hert &amp; þi ferce corage, Þat fired han þi grene tendre age, Deuoide of drede eche peril to endure, Þat oure enmys of þi mysauenture Reioysshe nat, myn ovne broþer dere. And my?ty Mars I pray, of hert entere, Þilke day on Troyanysche grounde, From her hondys þe to kepe sounde, Like as I wolde þat he dide me.” To whom anon, with al humilite, In manly wyse þis ?onge, lusty kny?t, Þis worþi Troylus, of hert[e] fresche &amp; li?t, Answerd ageyn, &amp; seide with glad chere: “Myn owne lord, and my broþer dere, And God to-forn, I fully schal obeie To fulfille what ?e liste to seye Now vn-to me of ?oure gentilnes, And nat declyne þoru? no reklesnes In any point from ?oure comaundement; But with hool herte, in al my best entent, I schal take hede, and pleinly do non oþer Þan ?e han seide, myn owne lord &amp; broþer, So loth me were offende ?ow or greue.” And in þis wyse he lowly toke his leue; And forþe he rod, so like a manly kny?t, Þat to be-holde it was a noble si?t, Amonge his men he haueth hym so wele— Þre þousand kny?tes armyd in bri?t stele Enviroun rod with Troylus in þe feld. And þilke day he bare in his schelde, Passaunt of gold, þre lyouns richely, Þe chaump of a?our wrou?t ful craftely. And be þe gate he issed oute anon, And with hym ladde his kny?tes euerychon, To þe Grekis holdyng þe nexte weye. And Hector hasteth, al þat euer he may, Prudently his wardis to ordeyne; And to þe noble worþi breþre tueyne, To kyng Hupon and to Ardelaus, He assigned, þe stori telleth [þ]vs, Þe fourþe warde to guyen &amp; to wysse. And in þe lond þat callid was Larisse, Þe breþer two had[de] regnyd longe; And kyng Hupon passyngly was strong, And of stature like a champioun; And, saue Hector, in al Troye toun, Was noon to hym egal as of my?t, More deliuere, nor a better kny?t, And on his fon passyng dispitous— Whiche, with his broþer, callid Ardelaus, Foure þousand kny?tes had[de] for to lede, And seuene hundrid, sothly, as I rede. And to hem eke, lyke as writ Guydo, Worþi Hector assygned hath also Oon of his brether, callid Brymarchus, A noble kny?t, in armys ri?t famus, And had in manhod passyng excellence. And of Hector þei taken han licence, And rood her way amonges al þe pres Þoru? þe gate of Dardanydes. Þe fyfþe warde to han at his ledyng, Was by Hector comytted to þe kyng Þat of Cesoyne lord and prince was, And to his broþer, callid Pollydamas. And Cysones wern of hi?e stature, And my?t in armys passyngly endure —Vp-on whom many man behilde— And her kyng bare no þing in his scheld But a feld of goulis, as I fynde, Of oþer sygne Guydo makeþ no mynde. And forþe þei rood a ful sterne pas, Þis noble kyng and Pollydamas, Whan þei had of Hector leve take, Whiche euer in on besy was to make Þe sixte warde, with al his dilligence. And to þe kyng, callid Pretemense, Þat was ful worþi, boþe in wer &amp; pes, And to a duke þat hi?te Sterepes, Whiche was also ful worþi of his hond, He toke þe folke of Panonye lond, Hem to gouerne in þe feld þat day— Þe whiche peple hath in custom ay With-oute plate, haberioun, or maile, On swifte hors her fomen [for] to assaile, With my?ty bowes &amp; arowes scharp[e] grounde Þoru? an harneis mortally to wounde. And with þis folke, of Hector eke also Dephebus assygned was to go, In þe feld to guye hem an[d] to lede, And on her wey þei fast[e] gan hem spede. But or þei passe be Dardanydes, Ful discretly Hector for hem ches Paviseris, clad in mail and plate, Hem comaundyng, at issyng of þe ?ate, With þe archeris in þe feld to gon, And many worþi, wel armyd euerychon, To awaite on hem þat þei wer nat lore: For þis folke, þat I of spake to-fore, Of Panonye, had[de] non armure. But prudent Hector, for to make hem sure, Oute of Agreste, þe my?ty regioun, Hath chosen out, ful worþi of renoun, Þe beste kny?tes of hem euerychon, And with two kynges, Esdras &amp; Phion, Assygned hem for to taken hede To þe foot-men, whan þat þei haue nede. Þe whiche Phion, made ful rychely, Rood in a chaar al of yvory, Of whiche þe whelles, wrou?t ful corious, Wern of a tre y-callid Ebanus, Þe whiche tre groweth fer in Ynde, Blak of hewe; and also, as I fynde, Whan it is corve, þis tre wil wexe anon, Of his nature, hard as any stoon— Whan it is graue ouþer rounde or square. And of pure gold roued was þis chare, Fret with perle and many riche stonis, Þat swiche a-noþer [I trowe] nowher noon is In al þis world, if I schal nat feyne. And it was lad of my?ti kny?tes tweyne, Men of armys, with-Inne and with-oute Armyd in stele, ridyng rounde aboute Þis worþi kynges, Esdras &amp; Phion. And Hector hath callyd to hym anon On of his breþre, what-so þat be-falle, To be guyde and leder of hem alle— Þe name of whom was Pictagoras. And to þe grete Troyan, Eneas, Of whom to-forn made is menciun, Hector by good deliberaciun Þe seuenþe ward assigned hath to kepe, And vp-on stedis lusty for to lepe, Of swiche as wern vsaunt most to ride, Ful man[l]y kny?tes to haue be his syde, Whiche with Ewphronye vn-to Troye toun Comen so fer from her regioun, To fosteren hem for Hectoris sake. And whan þei had of hym leve take, Þei rood ful proudly forþe with Eneas, Out at þe gate a wonder kny?tly paas, Þe brode feld til þei haue atteyned. And in þis while Hector haþe ordeyned, Like myn auctor as I can reherse, Þe ei?te warde of þe folke of Perce, Worþi kny?tes, manly and ri?t wys, Þe whiche wern comitted to Parys, On hym þat day to awaite besyly; To whom Hector ful benygnely Spak and seide at his departyng: “O broþer myn, in al maner þing, Whan þou arte passed be Dardanydes, Þis day to fer put þe nat in pres Among[es] Grekis, nor in iupartie, Liste þat þi foon in meschef þe espie, To whom þei haue, of old &amp; newe date, In her hertis ful fresche &amp; mortal hate, Þe furie of whiche her brest haþ so enbracid, Þat it were hard out to ben arracid; Wherfor, broþer, loke þat þou be In al wyse nat to fer fro me, But kepe þe ne?e, þat no mysauenture Falle vp-on þe, so þat I may socure Þis day to þe, myn owne broþer dere.” To whom Paris, with ful humble chere, Answerid and seide, þat in euery þing He wolde obeie vn-to his biddyng, And rood his weye anon with his meyne In-to þe felde oute at þe cite. And Hector ay dide his besynes Þe nynþe warde in ordre for to dres, Whiche he þou?t hym silf[e] for to lede, In whiche he put, sothly, as I rede, Five þousand kny?tes born of Troye toun, Þe worþiest and grettest of renoun, And passyngly famous in kny?thod, Born be discent of Troyanysche blod. And of his breþer he toke with hym ten, Swiche as he knew for most manly men, Þat wer foreyn fro stok of regalye, Oute of þe lyne born in bastardrie, Whom Hector hadde in gret cher[i]te For þe kny?thod he koude in hem se. And whanne he had, be kny?tly puruyaunce, Alle his wardis sette in gouernaunce, Liche Mars hym silf fast[e] gan him spede With-oute abood for to take his stede, Whiche was in bokis callid Gallathe, Of alle hors havyng þe souereynte, As fer as men ride in any coost— Of whom Dares maketh so gret a boost, Of schap, of hi?te, and also of fayrnes, Of strengþe, of loke, and of gret swiftnes, So lik an hors parformed oute &amp; oute— And with a wyre men my?t hym turne aboute, Lik as Dares maketh mencioun. On whom Hector rood þoru? Troye toun, Armed at al, þat cam hym wonder wel, From foot til hed, ful richely &amp; wel, Þat schon as bri?t as sonne on someres day; And to Priam he helde þe ri?t[e] way. And whan þat he was comyn to þe kyng, He reherseth in ordre euery þing How he hath done, and all his ordinaunce, And lowly seide, “so it be plesaunce To ?oure noble royal excellence, I haue chosen with besy dilligence A þousand kny?tes, ful of suffisaunce, With fyve hundrid, to han attendaunce On ?our persone alweye where ?e be, With alle foot-men þat ben in þe cite, Þat schal await on ?ou euere in on. Wherfore, my lord, as fast as we ar goon, Lowly I praye to ?oure worþines To sewen vs, be good avisenes, Out at þe toun, and alwey eke þat ?e To-gidre kepe ?our kny?tes and meyne: Þis I beseche with al my fulle my?t, With-Inne þe boundis where as we schal fi?t Þat ?e suffre noon of hem to pace, But kepe ?ow hool in þe silf[e] place Atwixe vs and þis stronge cite, ?if we haue nede, þat ?e may ay se, Vs to releue kepyng ?ow a-side, And specially þer for to abide Where most is likly oure party to sustene; For euer among þer schal men go be-twene Of our expleit þe trouþe to reporte, [For] Whiche part Mars list þe feld to sorte, Of his power, þis ilke day fatal: For ?e schal ben oure castel &amp; oure wal, And oure refuge to saue vs from al smert. And specialy o þing ?e aduerte, Þat no deceit, fraude, nor tresoun Compassyd be behynde to þe toun Of oure foon þoru? oure reklesnes, Whiles þat we don oure besynes Ageyn[e]s hem in þe feld to fi?te: In al wyse her-to hath a sy?t, Þat no þing turne [vn-]to oure damage Þoru? her engyn, but werkyth as þe sage, With victorie þat we may conclude, So þat Grekis with fraude vs nat delude By non engyn of vnwar violence,— Hopyng alwey þat it is non offence To ?oure hi?nes þat I haue here saide.” And with þat word, Priamus abraide, Benygnely of chere and contenaunce, And seide: “Hector, my sothfaste suffisance, My final trust and supportacioun, In þi wyse disposicioun Hoolly I putte, as þou liste ordeyne: For nexte goddis—?if I schal nat feyne— My feith, my hope, &amp; al my sikernes, And my welfare, in verray sothfastnes, Comytted ben hool in-to þin honde, And gouernaunce, playnly, of my londe: As þou ordeynest, it most nedis be; And þis praier I make now for þe To þe goddis a-boue celestial, Þe to preserue, in party and in al, From eche meschef and aduersite, Þat þou maiste hom to þis cite Repeire in honour with laude &amp; victorie, So þat þe pris, renoun, and memorie Of þi name be putte in remembraunce, Perpetuelly þin honour to avaunce!— And fare now wel, myn owne sone dere.” And Hector þo, wiþ ful humble chere, His leue toke, and forþe he rood anoon Among his lordis &amp; kny?tes euerychon, As he þat was rote of al noblesse, Of kny?thod grounde, of strengþe &amp; hardines Þe verray stok, and þer-to invincible. For-as-moche as it was possible Þat Nature my?t hym graunt or kynde, Touching manhod, in bokis as I fynde, He had in hym souereine excellence, And gouernaunce medlid with prudence, Þat nou?t asterte him, he was so wis &amp; war. And in his scheld, I fynde, þat he bar Vp-on his brest, þis Troyan champioun, Þe chefe of gold, of goulys a lyoun Depeint þer-in, and in his baner bete Þe silfe same; and so amyd þe strete He toke þe weye to Dardanydes, Þat to beholde huge was þe pres, Noise of trompetis and of clariouns, Baners vnrollid, &amp; longe fresche penouns Of rede and whyte, grene, blew, &amp; blake. And in þis wyse Hector hath y-take Þe feld with-oute, with hert &amp; hool entent, As Mars hym silf had[de] be present. And þei þat he, as Guydo maketh mynde, Rood with—þe warde þat last[e] was be-hynde— Of his manhod he nolde nat abide, But smet his stede scharply in þe side— Of fel corage he hath his hors so peyned, Þe first[e] warde þat he hath atteyned, Be vale &amp; hil to-forn in þe frounters, Not astonyd of þe felle cheris Of þe Grekis, nor platly nat aferd; But liche a kny?t, euene a-forn her berd, He gan prese in, as her fo mortal. And in þis while, vp-on Troye wal, In sondry place on þe hi?e touris, As fresche be-seyn as May is with his flouris, Þe ladies þen ascendid of þe toun— So fair, so ?onge, stondyng enviroun Þe quene Eleyne, passyng fair to sene, Þe kynges dou?ters, &amp; goodly Pollycene, And many oþer, whiche of wommanhede In hert[e] wern ful of besy drede, Inly a-gast, and of fere affrayed Whan þei behilde in þe feld displaied Þe brode baners,—þat some of tendernes, Somme of loue, and somme of kyndenes, Pale and dredful for her lordis were; And somme her facis hydden [eke] for fere, Þat were nat bold to liften vp her si?t To be-hold þe armure clere and bri?t, So gliteryng ageyn þe son[n]e schene— Her hertis tendre my?t[e] nat sustene; And in her drede þus I lete hem dwelle. And of Grekis furþe I wil ?ow telle, ?if so be ?e list abide a whyle; For now most I my for-dullid stile Ageyn directe to Agamenoun. Wel may I make an exclamacioun On ignoraunce, þat stant so in my li?t, Whiche causeth me with a ful cloudy si?t In my makynge to speken of þe werre— For lak of termys I mote nedis erre, Connyngly my wordis for to sette; Cruel Allecto is besy me to lette, Þe ny?tes dou?ter, blindid by dirknes, Be craft of armys þe trouþe to expresse, In ordre due a feld to discryue: And Chaucer now, allas! is nat alyue Me to reforme, or to be my rede, For lak of whom slou?er is my spede— Þe noble Rethor þat alle dide excelle; For in makyng he drank of þe welle Vndir Pernaso, þat þe Musis kepe, On whiche hil I my?t[e] neuer slepe— Onneþe slombre—for whiche, allas, I pleyne; But for al þis, þer is no more to seyne. Þou? my wede be nat polymyte, Colourles, forþe I wil endyte As it cometh euene to my þou?t, Pleinly to write how þe kyng haþ wrou?t, Þe manly kny?t, gret Agamenoun, Lyk as þe latyn maketh mencioun. Howe Agamenon ordeynyde syx and twenty warddys, and assygnede theme tyle kyngis, princes, and lordys of his Oste; and howe worthi Ector, at þe first encounterynge, departede Patroclus atwyne. What! trowe ?e, þat he in his entent Was founde slou?e, ouþer necligent On Grekis half his wardis for to make? Nay, nay, nat so; for hym list to wake Þat tyme more, sothly, þan to slepe, Ful lik a kyng þat day þe feld to kepe. No necligence my?t his hert[e] fade: For [in] þat day, I fynde, þat he made Six and twenty wardis by and by, So wel deuised, and so prudently Þat no man my?t amende his ordinaunce. And of þe first he ?af gouernaunce To þe manful noble Patroclus, Þat with hym ladde (myn auctour telleþ þus) Mirundones, so my?ti and so stronge, With alle þe folke þat to Achilles longe, Besyde þilke þat wern of his meyne Whiche þat he brou?t out of his contre At his comyng to þe sege of Troye; And he rood furþe with hem on his woye In-to þe feld, and made no delaye. Now, fille it so on þe same day Þat Achilles kepte hym in his tente, And for seknes þat day oute ne wente; For his lechis made hym to abstene, For his woundes fresche wern &amp; grene Þat he kau?t on þe day to-fore; Whiche for to hele of her akyng sore, He be counseil kepte hym silf[e] cloos, And from his bed þat day nat ne roos, In hope only þe bettre to endure Whan þat he was restored vn-to cure. But alle his men he toke to Patroclus, Whiche was in armys passyngly famus, And be discent come of gret kynrede, And was also—of hym as I rede— Habundaunt of gold and of riches, And fer comendid for his gentilles, And hadde a name of hi?e discrecioun. Now was þer euere swiche affeccioun Of entere loue, trouþe, &amp; feithfulnes, So gret desyre and inward kyndenes, Besy þinkyng, &amp; so gret feruence, So moche frendeschip &amp; þou?tful aduertence, So huge brennyng, passyng amerous, Betwixe Achilles &amp; þis Patroclus, Þat her hertis were lokkid in o cheyne; And what-so-euer, if I schal nat feyne, Þe ton hath wrou?t, as broþer vn-to broþer, In hert it was confermyd of þe toþer: For wil and godys, boþe were commvne, And to þe deth þei euere so contvne,— With-oute chaunge her loue so abood. And Patroclus furþe anoon hym rood In-to þe feld with Myrundones, And in his tent abideth Achilles. Þe secounde warde to kynge Meryoun Assigned was by Agamenoun; And to þe worþi kyng Ydwme[n]e, And to a duke þat hi?t[e] Meneste, Þre þousand kny?tes in stele armyd clene, With alle þe folke þat cam fro Athene, Assygned werne with hem for to go. Þe þrid[de] ward to kyng Astalapho, And to his sone, þat hi?t[e] Philomene, Wiþ þe kny?tes þat cam fro Kwmene; Þe fourþe warde, with-oute more lettyng, To Archelaus, þe noble worþi kyng, To Prothenor, and to Securidan, Whiche in his daies was so strong a man, Assigned was holy to þese þre, And alle þe kny?tes with hem for to be Of Boece, þe grete lond famous. Þe fyfþe warde to kyng Menelaus, With alle þe folke of þe regioun Callid Spartence, of ful hi?e renoun, And of þe Iles þat wern adiacent— Alle þese with þe baner went Of Menelay, fresche and coraious. Þe sixte warde to kyng Epistrofus Was assigned, and to þe kyng Elyde, With many worþi ridyng be his side Of þe prouynce and þe famous Ile Þat callid is in Guydo Fordesyle. Þe seuenþe warde to Thelamonyus, Callid Aiax, þe grete kyng famous, Was assigned, schortly to termyne, Wiþ þe folkis þat fro Salomyne He with hym brou?t, &amp; many anoþer mo; And foure erlis with him went also: Theseus and eke Amphimacus, And þe þridde I-callid Darius, And þe fourþe namyd Polysarie. Þe ei?te ward, ?if I schal nat tarie, Be good avis þat day assigned was Vn-to þe kyng þat callid was Thoas. Aiax Cileus þe ny[n]þe warde ladde, And þe tenþe þe kyng of Philete hadde; And to þe kyng þe xi [he] dide assigne, Þat sothly was, boþe of birþe &amp; lyne, So renomed, &amp; of so gret encres, Þe my?ty kyng callid Pallamydes, Kyng Naulus sone, hi?est born of blood. And duke Nestor, ful famus in kn[y]?thood, Þe twelþe warde ladde on Grekis side, Malencolik and surquedous of pride. And kyng Honux, sone of on Mabente, In-to þe feld, pleinly, whan he wente, In ordre hadde of wardis þe þrittene, Proudly mowsteryng endelong þe grene, Ageyn[e]s Troyens redy for to fi?t. And eke þe kyng þat Vilixes hi?t Ladde with hym þe fourtenþe, as I rede; And Humerus þe kyng eke dide lede Þe fiftenþe, myn auctor writeth þus; And a duke, callid Curibulus, Þe xvi. ladde vp-on that day, In whiche þe kny?tes of kyng Prothesylay Assigned wern by gret ordinaunce, Tenforsen hem for to do vengaunce Vp-on þe deth of her worþi kyng, By Hector slawe at Grekis arivyng. And kyng Royda ladde þe seuentene; And he þat was kyng of Octymene, Þe xviii warde had at his ledyng; And ?antipus, þat was of Lyde kyng, Hadde to kepe, committed to his garde, On Grekis side þe nyntenþe warde. And þe twenty, myn auctor lereþ vs, Hadde þe kyng callid Amphimacus, Lik a kny?t to guye hem &amp; to wisse; And Philocetes, þat was kyng of Larisse, Þe oon &amp; twenty had eke, as I rede. Þe two &amp; twenty had[de] Dyomede; And Heneus, kyng of Cypary, Þat was whilom so noble &amp; so worþi, Þe þre &amp; twenty had in gouernaille. And þe Troyens proudly for to assaille Þe xxiiii??, with swerd, spere, and schelde, Kyng Prothaylus ladde in-to þe felde; And Carpenor, of Carpadie kyng, In werre expert &amp; ri?t wys in wirchyng, Þe five &amp; twenty, riche &amp; wel be-seyn, On Grekis syde brou?t in-to þe pleyn. Þe sixe &amp; twenti, sothly, and þe laste, As he þat coude sen a-forn an[d] caste Euery þing be good inspeccioun, Þe wyse kyng, þe grete Agamenoun, Had with hym, þis prudent werriour, As he þat was ordeyned emperour Of Grekis host, as wysest of echon. Howe bothe the wardys of þe Troyans and of þe Grekys fyrst ioynede in the felde. And in þis wise forþe þe Grekis goon In-to þe feld, with pompe ful royal, With thensygnes and tokenes marcial, Han take her ground, passingly arrayed; And on her stondardis, richely displaied, Brode baners an[d] many fresche penoun— Ageyn þe wynde þat made a hidous soun, And ri?t dredful, pleinly, for to here— And þer men seie many crestis clere, And many tuft of gold &amp; siluer schene, Meynt with feþris rede, white, &amp; grene, And deuyses wonder merueillous, And of folkis þat wern amerous Þe tokenes born to schewen openly How þei in loue brenten inwardly Som hi?e emprise þat day to fulfille. And þer wer herd þe loude noyses schrille Fer in þe feld, and þe dredful sownes Boþe of trompettis and of clariouns, Þat be kalendys of schedyng oute of blood. And with þe noyse al-most for rage wood, Þe fomy bridelis &amp; þe mouþes blede, And furious neying of many [bastard] stede— Praunsynge of hors vp-on ouþer side, With alle þensygnes þat my?t ben of pride On Grekis part[y], and on Troye also: In kny?tly wyse for to haue a-do, Eueryche warde stondynge in his place. Þe first, a-sondre but a litel space, Be-gan to approche with al her ful entent, And Hector þo, ful inpacient, Formest of alle on þe side of Troye, Þe Ire of whom no man my?t acoye: But lik a lyoun in his hungri rage Issed oute, furious of visage, Toward Grekis on his my?ti stede, Þat with his sporis made his sides blede— His kny?tly hert so inly was to-torn Of mortal Ire,—and as he rood to-forn, Brennynge ful hote in his malencolye: Þe whiche þing whan Grekis gan espie, Patroclus, with-oute more abood, Of surquedie a-fore þe wardis rood, Oute al to-forn, in boþe hostis si?t, For to encontre, pleinly, ?if he my?t, With worþi Hector whan he him saw a-fer; And as ri?t lyne as is diameter, Rood vn-to hym in his hatful tene, And with a spere, scharp[e] grounde &amp; kene, Þoru?-oute his schelde, of envious rage, He smote Hector, with-oute more damage, Except only þat þe hed of stele Þat was to-forn, forged &amp; whet ful wele, Þoru? plate &amp; maile my?tely gan glace, But to þe skyn for no þing my?t his trace— Al-be it cam of passyng violence— ?it to Hector it dide noon offence, Out of his sadel onys hym to flitte: For þou? þat he sturdely hym hitte, He my?t[e] nat bakward bow his chyne, Nor on no parti make hym to enclyne; But fatally to his confusioun, Þis my?ti man, þis Troyan champioun, In his Ire ay brennynge more and more, Vp-on hym þe hate frat so sore, Lefte his spere, myn auctor writeth þus, And with a swerd rood to Patroclus, Avised fully þat he schal be ded; And furiously gan hamen at his hed, And rof hym doun, þer was no maner lette, In-to þe brest þoru? his basenet, As seith Guydo, with so gret a peyne, Þat with þe stroke he partid hym on tweyne. His mortal swerde whettid was so kene, Þat Patroclus my?t[e] nat sustene Vp-on his hors, but fil doun to grounde, As he þat kau?t his last[e] fatal wounde, Beyng present his kny?tes euerychon. And delyuerly vp-on hym anon, Worþi Hector from his stede a-doun Discendid is lik a wode lyoun, Of hatful Ire brennynge as þe fire, Havinge in hert inly gret desire To spoilen hym of his armvure anoon, In whiche þer was [ful] many riche stoon, Boþe of rubies and saphiris ynde— For þilke daies, pleinly, as I fynde, Kynges, lordis, &amp; kny?tes (þis no nay) To bataille went in her best array. And, sothly, Hector, whan he first gan se Þe multitude of stonys and perre On Patroclus, so orient and schene, Vp-on his arme he hynge his hors[e] rene, Þe mene while, whil he of hool entent To cacche his praye was so dilligent, Of couetyse, in þer alder si?tes. Til Merioun, with þre þousand kny?tes, Armed in stele, rounde a-boute hym alle, Is sodeynly vþ-on Hector falle, Þe dede cors of Patroclus to saue, Þat his purpos Hector may nat haue, At liberte þe riche kyng to spoille, Whiche caused hym in anger for to boille. Howe Kynge Meryon salutede worthy Ectore as he was aboute for to dyspoyle Kynge Patroclus. To whom þe kyng, callid Merion, Irous &amp; wood, seide among echon: “O gredy lyoun, o wolfe most rauenous, O hatful tygre, passyng envious, Of avarice, o beste in-saturable, And of desire, sothly vnstaunchable, Vp-on þis pray þou schalt þe nat now fede, Go ellis-where to swe for þi mede: For trust[e] well, in conclusioun, Fifti þousand, to þi distructioun, Of oon entent, pleinly, wil nat faille Þin hatful pride attonys for to assaille!” And sodeinly, with speris scharp[e] whette, On euery half þei gonne hym be-sette, Maugre his force, his my?t, &amp; his manhede Enforcyng hem tarevid him his stede, Þat, sothfastly, of gret violence, He constreyned, for al his strong diffence, As seith Guydo, to falle vp-on his kne; But þoru? his my?t &amp; magnanymyte, He of manhood hath his hors recurid, And maugre Grekis is so moche assurid In his strengþe and his gret[e] my?t, Þat he recurid lik a worþi kny?t His stede ageyn amiddes of his foon. And ri?t as lyne he rood to Merion, Ful desyrous on hym avengid to be, In his furye of hasty cruelte: For þer-vppon was sette al his delit, Þat in his mortal blody appetit, In verray soth, he hadde hym slaw anon, Saue þat þe kyng, which called was Glacon, Cam to rescue hym with kyng Theseus, And his sone, þat hi?t Archilagus, As I haue tolde, Merion to rescue. And þre þousand kny?tes gan hym swe, Ful assentid, attonis, in bataille, For lyf or deth Hector to assaille, In a-wait vnwar on hym to sette. But al þis whyle, with whom þat euer he mette, With his swerde he kylleth &amp; bare doun, Þat finally þer gayneth no raunsoun: For any Greke þat durst wyth hym mete, At departyng felte ful vnswete; He made a weye aboute hym euery-where, Þat þei fledde hym as þe deþ for fere, For where he rod he made a path ful pleyn. And, as I rede, to Patroclus ageyn He is repeired to spoille hym ?if he my?t, Amyd þe feld in þe Grekis si?t, As he þat wolde his praye nat li?tly lete. Til Ydwme, þe my?ty kyng of Crete, With two þousand clad in plate &amp; maille, Worþi kny?tes, Hector to assaille Whyles þat he was so desirous, As I haue tolde, to spoille Patroclus— And new ageyn, to his confusioun, Lyk as I fynde, cam kyng Merioun; And or Hector my?t[e] taken hede, Þei of force reften hym his stede, Þat sothly he, þer was noon oþer bote, Compellid was [for] to fi?t on fote. And of kny?thod his hert[e] he reswmeth; And with his swerde aboute hym he conswmeth Al þat wiþ-stood, boþen hors &amp; man; And furiously þis Troyan kny?t be-gan Armys, leggis, schuldris, by þe boon, To hewen of, amyd his mortal foon, Þat Grekis my?t a-forn him nat sustene. And, as I rede, þat he slowe fiftene Of hem þat were besy hym to take; And swiche a slaw?ter he gan a-mong hem make, Þat þei ne durste abide a-forn his face. And Merion, in þe silfe place, Þis mene while, toke vp Patroclus, With hevy chere and face ful pitous, And on his stede he leide it hym be-forn; And to his tent [anon] he hath it born— Alwey Grekis, in her cruel mood, Aboute Hector, furious and wood, Felly abood, fi?tynge vp-on fote. Of whiche somme felt[e] ful vnswote, Þat preswmed vp-on hym to prese; But of manhod þei ne wolde sese To be-sette hym vppon euery syde, Havinge a truste, in her grete pride, Finally at meschef hym to take: For þei dempte he my?t[e] nat eskape Her hondis, schortly, be non aventure, Nor his stede be lyklyhede recure; For of force þei casten hym to lette, And al attonys gan on hym to sette. And specialy, amonge hem euerychon, I finde, in soth, how þat þer was oon, A Grekysche kny?t of ri?t worþi fame, And Carion, pleinly, was his name, Þat him afforcede Hector to oppresse, Whan he was most in meschef &amp; distresse, Be-set with Grekys hym envirownynge: Til of fortune, on hym awaitynge Þe longe day in þat felle fi?t, To his rescus þer cam a Troyan kny?t, Myd of Grekis whan he was be-set, And toke two dartes, scharp &amp; kene whet, And furiously first he schot þe toon, And þoru? þe hert he smote þis Carion, Þat þe darte into þe felde gan glide, By plate &amp; maille, þoru?-out oþer syde, Þat fatally of þat dedly wounde Þis Carioun glood anoon to grounde, Amonge an hundrid kny?tes of his feris, A-fore conspired with her felle cheris To haue slayn Hector be some maner woye. But eft ageyn þis ?onge kny?t of Troye Ful deliuerly rau?t anoþer spere, And cast at on þat he sawe a-fere Avaunce hym silfe on Hector in þe felde, And þoru? his platis, pleinly, &amp; his schelde, Lyne ri?t, þat he ne schuld asterte, Of verray my?t rofe hym þoru? þe herte; And after þat, in al þe haste he coude, Vp-on Troyens he gan to crie loude Tenhasten hem kny?tly to socure Worþi Hector, þat stood in auenture Amonge Grekis, havynge no refute, Sool by hym silfe, of helpe destitute. At whiche cry, on Grekis al vnwar, First of alle cam worþi Cyncybar, Þat broþer was to Hector in bast born; And hym silfe rydynge al to-forn, And þe kny?tes of whiche he was guyde, Wonder proudly prikynge by his syde, Sodeinly, bothe oon and alle, In a frosche be on þe Grekis falle, Þat hadde Hector rounde be-sette aboute; And þoru? manhod of þis grete route Þat ben enbosched on hem at þe bak, Þe hundrid kny?tes, of whiche þat I spak, For-a-stonyd gan hem to withdrawe: But þritti firste cruelly were slawe; And maugre hem, Hector of manhede Amydde þe felde taken hath his stede, And entrid [is] in amonge þe prees. And he þat day, of kny?thood pereles, While he hilde his blody swerde on hond, Alle þo þat ageyn hym stonde —Þer was noon help, pleinly, nor no red— But þat he brak &amp; carfe a-two þe þrede And þe knot of cruel Antropos: Only for he was lette of his purpos, At good leyser to spoile Patroclus. Þerfore, in Ire wood and furious, Ful cruelly Grekis quitte her mede, Whiche from his face faste gan hem spede, Whos scharp[e] swerde, baþed in her blood, Was dyed rede: for it dide hym good Vp-on hem avenged for to be. For þilke day [þe] lyoun pleyed he, Vp-on Grekis his manhod for to haunte; For he her pride so mortally gan daunte, Þat þei hym fled, where-so þat he rood, Makyng al hoot þe stremys of her blood Endelonge to renne vp-on þe grene, Til þe tyme þe duke of grete Athene, Þat callid was whilom Menesteus, With þre þousand kny?tes ful famous, Of whiche he was boþe lord &amp; guyde, Þe feld hath taken vp-on þe left[e] side, For a deceyt, in ful secre wyse, Where Troylus was with þe folke of Fryse, Whiche [haþ] þat day, who-so liste to seke, By his kny?thod kylled many Greke:— Liche a tigre, gredy on his pray, Troylus bar hym al þe longe day, Sleynge of Grekis many worþi kny?t. And while þat he was besiest in fi?t Ageyn his foon, with kyng Antipus And þe kyng þat hi?t[e] Alcanus, Vp-on Grekis elyche fresche and newe, Makynge her sydes al of blody hewe, By oon assent, þis þre þoru? her manhede— And specially, vppon his baye stede, Wher-so-euer þat þis Troylus rood, Euery Greke þat his swerd abood Sodeinly he made for to sterve, Þoru? her platis so depe he dide kerue. And þis contvneth til duke Meneste Of Troylus saw þe grete cruelte, And þe slaw?tre þat he on Grekis made— Of hasty Ire, wiþ face pale and fade, Hent a spere &amp; þrewe it in þe reste And Troylus smet euene amyd þe breste So sternely, þat maugre his renoun, To þe erþe anon he bare hym doun, In [þe] myddis of his mortal foon, Þat cruelly hym be-sette anoon, And him to treyne leide out hoke &amp; laas Rounde aboute in maner of compas— Wiþ spere and darte &amp; swerdis forgid bri?t. But he hym silf diffendiþ like a kny?t, With gret manhod his honour to avaunce, Al-be his lif was honged in balaunce, Where he stood, &amp; felte ful vnswete, In poynt of deth amonge þe hors[e] fete, With gret await of duke Meneste, How þis Troylus my?t haue take be, Of mortal hate castyng in his þou?t, At meschef take þat he eskape nou?t;— On euery half he was so be-sette With swerdis rounde, kene gronde &amp; whette, Allone, allas! mortally be-stadde— Þei sesid hym, &amp; furþe þei han hym ladde, Til Miseres, a worþi kny?t of Troye, Gan to crye, as he stood in þe woye, For-a-bassched, in ri?t furious wyse: “O ?e noble worþi men of Fryse! Manly kny?tes, ay preued in þe feld, Most renomed boþe with spere &amp; scheld, Considereth now vn-to ?our hi?e fame, And aduerteth þe glorie of ?oure name, How þis day, þoru? ?oure necligence, By þe power and my?ti violence Of þe Grekis Troylus is I-take Sool in þe feld; for ?e han hym forsake— Þat schal rebounde to ?oure alder schame: For ?e, in soth, gretly are to blame, ?if he, þat is of worþines[se] flour, Be take of Grekis for lak of socour— Þat, but ?if ?e taken hasty wreche, Schamful report ?our honour schal apeche Perpetuelly, and seide þer-of amys, In ?oure defaute þat Troylus taken is, Whiche named be so worþi &amp; famus.” And with þat word, þe kyng Alcamus Of malencolye felt his hert[e] ryue, And in his Ire hent a spere blyve, And prikynge after, enhasteþ w[h]at he mi?t, Til he of hem pleinly had a si?t, Þat besy wern Troylus for to lede. And he, ful kny?tly, sittyng on his stede, Ran oon þoru?, þat he fil doun ded; And eft ageyn, pale &amp; no þing red, In his rancour no lenger wold[e] lette, But a Greke, þe first[e] þat he mette, Þoru? þe body smette he with a spere, Þat men my?t[e] se þe poynt a-fere, By brest and plate þoru? þe scholder-bon, Þat to þe grounde he fil doun ded anoon. And þer-with-al, þe worþi Freses alle Cam flokmel doun, and on Grekis falle So my?tely, þat, maugre her diffence, Þei sette vp-on with so gret violence Þat Troylus is from al daunger fre; And þoru? her kny?tly magnanymyte Þei maden hym to recure his stede. And specially helpyng in þis nede Was ?antipus, þe strong[e] manly kyng, Whiche of disdeyn, at his in-comyng, On Meneste gan his spere grate, And þoru? his scheld, mail, &amp; þikke plate, So sore he smot, þat þis Menestee Had be ded, nadde his armour be; Whiche for Ire gan to tremble &amp; schake, Þat Troylus was from his hondis take, And eskaped to be prisoner, Dispit his berd, &amp; maugre his power. Wherfor he gan of hasti hoot envie On his kny?tes furiously to crye, Þat wer so my?ti, renomed, &amp; stronge, To peynen hem for to venge his wronge Vp-on Troyens, to mete hem in þe face. And þei in hast gan my?tely enbrace Her scharp[e] speris, grounde for to bite, And felly foyne, &amp; to-gidre smyte; For þo be-gan þe grete mortal werre: Þe fire brast out, schene as any sterre, On basenettis and her platis bri?t, Þat þoru? þe feld flawmeþ þe [ferful] li?t: [To lyf nor deth þei toke þo non hede;] [And] Doun þe playn, boþe in lengþe &amp; brede, Þe wardis gan proudly to avale; And with lokis of envie pale, Þei aproche, and assemble I-fere, In hate brennynge, þat no man may stere, And gan hurtle with spere, swerd, &amp; darte, And mortally, vp-on euery parte, Þe slau?ter gan gretly for to rewe. And Iliche, alwey newe and newe, Hector Grekis, þoru? his worþines, Where he rood manly dide oppresse, And merciles slowe hem &amp; bar doun— Now here, nowe þere, with-oute excepcioun, So furiously, þat rowthe was to se. And þanne of new þe duke Meneste Repeired is, with envious hert, From his hondis þat Troylus so asterte, And for þe slaw?ter eke of his meyne, Þat wher he rood he besy was to sle Þe Troyan peple, whan he my?t hem mete; For tavenge hym, for no þing wold he let. Til casuelly amonge[s] al þe pres, A kny?t he mette, þat hi?t[e] Miseres, Whiche, in dispit of þis Meneste, Had at þe rescus of worþi Troylus be, And maugre hym put him fro his pray. And so be-fil [on] þe selue day, As þei mette ageyn of aventure, Þat Meneste, by his cote armvre Marked hym, be armys þat he bar, And sodeinly, or þat he was war, Or þat he my?t taken any hede, Furiously on his sterne stede, And with a spere, among þe rengis alle, Bar him ouer, &amp; made hym for to falle, Maugre his my?t, to þe erthe doun. And panne, I finde, how þe kyng Hupoun Discendid is, þe story list nat lye, Two þousand kny?tes in his companye, Whiche on Grekis felly gan to sette, And in þe berd king Prothenor hem mette, And Archelaus, þe noble werriour, Of Boece lord and gouernour— Wiþ helpe only of þis Prothenor, Lik a tigre or a wylde bore, Gan Troyens assaille to þe deth, And many on þilke day he sleth. But kyng Hupoun, þoru? his chiualrie, Þilk[e] tyme in his malencolye Ful many Greke ?af his deþis wounde: And þus þei gan eche oþer to confounde, Swiche mortal hate amonges hem þer was. Til of fortune a kny?t, Polydamas, On Troye side, sone of Anthenor, With his kny?tes, and hym silf to-for, Is on Grekis of envious pride Mid her wardis fallyn in a-syde, And gan breke hem, &amp; kny?tly to disseuere, Ageyn whos swerd þei my?t[e] nat perseuere— He was on hem so inly furious. And hym to helpe cam þe kyng Remvs, With a wynge on þe toþer parte, Brekyng in with many spere &amp; darte Ageyn[es] Grekis with þre þousand kny?tes, Þat to beholde how felly þat he fi?tes, It was, in sothe, vn-to hem of Troy A verray lust and an heuenly Ioye— To sen how he Grekis brak asondre, Þat þe noyse, loude as any þondre, In þe feld of strokis gan a-ryse. And while Remus, as ?e han herd deuise, Vp-on Grekis was so envious, In-to þe feld cam Menelaus, With his worþi kny?tes of Spartense, Ageyn Remus to make resistence; And ful proudly, makyng no delay, Þis worþi Remus &amp; kyng Menelay, On hors[e]-bak, with scharp[e] speris whette, Mid þe felde of envie mette, And þoru? her manly prowesse &amp; renoun, From hors[e]-bak eche bare oþer doun: For noon þe strok of oþer my?t[e] schoone. And in þat while, of Anthenor þe sone, Polydamas, lusti, fresche, and ly?t, As he þat was in his deliuer my?t, And desirous to honour to atteyne, Mette in þe felde þe nevewe of Eleyne, Þe my?ti duk called Mereus, Flouring in ?outhe and ri?t vertuous, Fresche armed, new and lusti of corage, And was, in soth, but twenti ?ere of age— Whiche of so ?onge was a noble kny?t, Ri?t renomed boþe of hert and my?t. But of fortune it be-fil, allas! Þe Troyan kny?t, daun? Polydamas, With a spere, þoru? scheld, maille, &amp; plate Hitte hym so, þat, by cruel faate, Amonge Grekis þat he fil doun ded. Of whiche þing, whan Menelay toke hede, And sawe hym ly, slay[e]n on þe grene, In his hert remembringe on þe quene —Þe quene Eleyne, whos nevew he was:— For dool of whiche, a ful deliuer paas To Remvs rood, in his cruelte, Also fer as he my?t hym se, And ful kny?tly mette hym in þe berd, And smette at him with his scharpe swerde Vp-on þe hede, in his hatful tene, Þat on his stede he my?t[e] nat sustene: His wounde was so passyngly mortal, Þat with þe stroke and þe perlous fal, His kny?tes wende ded he had[de] be, And hent hym vp, and be-gan to fle To-Troye-ward with hym a gret pas. But it be-fil þat Pollydamas, Þe maner of hem whan þat he be-held, Made hem repeire kny?tly in-to þe feld— Excepte þat somme, as þei in biddyng had, Worþi Remvs hom to Troye ladde, Pale and ded, with his woundis wide. And þo cam in on þe Grekis side Celides, þe lusty fresche kyng, Of whom Dares seith in his writyng, And for a soth in his boke list telle, How Celides alle oþer dide excelle Boþe in bewte and in semlyhede, Of schap, of port, and of goodlyhede, Surmountynge alle, as Dares list discrive, As in fairnes alle þo a-lyue— Alle his lymys compact were so clene. And, as I rede, þe ?onge fresche quene Of Femenye, whiche was of bewte flour, Kyng Celides louede paramour, Þat vp-on hym was hooly hir plesaunce, He was so prented in hir remembraunce; For chef resort, sothly, of hir herte, Was vp-on hym euery houre to aduerte: For, finally, he departeþ nou?t, Day nor ny?t nor hour out of hir þou?t; For he was ffully al hir owne kny?t. But, of fortune, he, lusty, fresche, and li?t, Smot his stede scharply in þe syde Of surquedie, and proudly gan to ride Of mortal hate a ful furious paas Ri?t as lyne to Pollydamas, And with a spere made hym for to flytte From his sadel, in whiche he dide sitte— He markyd hym with so gret a my?t. But ageynward, þis manly Troyan kn[y]?t, Pollydamas, with a dispitous face, Or Celydes departeth fro þe place, With a swerd so smet hym on þe hede, From his stede þat he fil doun ded, Whiche to Grekis was gret confusioun. And al þis tyme, ferser þanne lyoun, Hector Grekis kny?tly gan enchase, And ofte made hem for to lese her place; Where-euere he rood, of necessite, A-forn his swerd he made hem for to fle, Swiche vengaunce he hath on hem take, Þat þei þe feld were fayn to for-sake, And to purswe wolde he neuer fyne; Til a-monge þe peple of Salomyne, Hector mette þe worþi kyng famous Þat was hir lord, and hi?t[e] Thesalus, Þat many Troyan þat day had[de] slawe. And, as Hector toward hym gan drawe, Kyng Teuter, þat was of Grece also, A manly kny?t and prudent, boþe two, Rau?t a spere, in al þe haste he can, And vnwarly vn-to Hector ran, And þoru? his scheld, [plate], and mail of stele —Þe spere-hed forged was so wele, So scharpe &amp; square, &amp; so kene grounde— Þat he ?af Hector a ful perillous wounde. But as Hector rene gan his stede, Proude Teuter to aquite his mede, He ful wysly, in al þe hast he my?t, Was ri?t fer seuery[d] from his si?t; Wher-of Hector malencolius, And of hert wod and furious For þe akyng of his wounde grene, In haste to avenge þe constreint of his tene, What Greke after schortly þat he mette, Þat was so bold his wey[e] to with-sette, With-oute mercy, he was his deth anoon. And, as I rede, he encountrid on, Whiche of pride wold[e] hym diuerte, Whom wiþ his swerd he rof to þe hert, Þoru? his harneis, of malencolye. Þe whiche stroke whan Grekis gan espie, Þei astonyd, of oon entencioun, Perllously besette hym enviroun, And swiche assaut gan aboute him make, Þoru? her manhod ?if þei my?t him take; And of acorde, with gret multitude, Cruelly þei gan hym to include, Be liklyhede, in þat mortal strife He my?t[e] nat eskape with þe lyf, On hym þei wern so fel &amp; envious. Howe A kynge callyde Theseus, of affeccyon warnede Ector to be ware of A iopartdy that he stode In, notwithstondynge this Thesyus was a Greke; and howe Ector raskewyde Pollydamas þe kynge. Til þat a kyng þat hi?t[e] Theseus, On Grekis side, only of gentillesse, Swiche rouþe kau?t vp-on his distresse, To se hym stonde so ni?e vp-on þe wrak, Þus vn-to hym of manly pite spake: “O flour of kny?thod, rote of hardynesse, Welle of manhood, stok of worþines! Whi list þe nat to haue noon aduertence, Þi lif to saue, of kny?tly prouidence, But wilfully, where most is to drede, Þi lif iupartist, and take list noon hede, In mortal pereil how þou arte be-set, Amonge so many closed and I-schet, Allone, allas! deuoide of al socour, And to þi silfe wilt do no fauour, But as fortune liketh to ordeyne?— Þat euery wy?t ow?t[e] to compleyne To beholde þat so noble a kny?t, Whiche þoru? þe worlde cast so clere a li?t, In worþines, &amp; wil hym nat with-drawe, Reklesly þis day to be slawe, So pitously þi persone for to lese! With-drawe þin hond, ?it sith þou maist chese, Þin hi?e prowes compelleth me to praye, At swiche meschef þat þou nat ne deye.” And whan Hector of hym gan take hede, He þankid hym of his goodlyhed, And maugre, sothly, þe power &amp; þe my?t Of þe Grekis, lik a worþi kny?t He skapid is, myd of alle his foon, And went his weye þoru? hem euerychon, His blody swerd alweie in his hond. And in his weie Pollydamas he fonde, Ful lik a man, with al his besy peyne Diffende hym silfe ageyn þe kynges tweyne, Menelay and Thelamonyus, Whiche vp-on hym were ful furious; And, with a spere, þis Greke, þis Thelamoun Pollydamas smot to the erthe doun, Compellyng hym—þer was non oþer bote— Ageyn hem two for to fi?t on fote, Assentid fully on hym to ben a-wroke. And first þei han hewen and to-broke Þe my?ti charnellis of his basenet, And whan his viser after was of smette, And his face nakid was and bare, Þei fil on hym in þat mortal snare, And token hym, þe stori can deuise, And sent hym forþe, in ful cruel wise, Toward Grekis, with many worþi kny?t. But whan Hector þer-of had a si?t, And sawe þe meschef of Pollydamas, He cast fully to socur in þis caas, And priked after, woder þanne lyoun; And, where he rood, aboute hym enviroun With his swerd he made a large space, Til he cam to þe same place Amonge Grekis, furious and wood, Pollidamas þe silfe tyme stood, Socourles from al remedie, Til þat he on Hector cast his eye, Þat Grekis made hastily with-drawe. And þritti, first, of hem he hath slaw, And seuered hem, maugre al her pride:— To-forne his swerd þe[i] durst[e] nat abide Ageyn[e]s hym, nor make noon obstacle; But of kny?thod, be verray hi?e myracle, Pollydamas, in meschef first awapid, From Grekis hond frely is eskapid. But freschely þo, þe kyng Epistrophus, Menelay, and Thelamonyus, With alle her kny?tes to-gidre hol &amp; clos, Ageyn Troyens to geten hem a loos, Been of newe entrid in bataille With gret strengþe &amp; passyng apparaille, Þat me?tely Troyens þei compelle, In her weye þat þei dar nat dwelle, Nat-with-stondynge her gret worþines, Nor of Hector þe kny?tly hi?e prowes, Þat fau?t so manly þat tyme, as I rede,— But cowardly þei han slawe his stede, Þat he constreined was to fi?t on fote, Þat many Greke felt[e] ful vnswote. For þer was noon þat aboute him stood, With his swerd þat he ne schad his blood; Þou? he so þikke aboute was be-leyn, He voided hem &amp; made a spase pleyn, In compas rounde, be-hind &amp; eke to-forn; And on his feet so wel he hath him born Þilk[e] day, þat Greke was noon, certeyn, Þat hardy was hond on hym to leyn, He was so strong, &amp; sturdy as a wal. And whanne his breþer, callid natural, Sawe hym on fote, myd of alle his foon, On a frusche þei fel in euerychon, And founden hym, þe stori makeþ mynde, Diffende hym silfe lik a tigre in Ynde; And hym to help, þoru? her hi?e renoun, Þei fel[le] firste on kyng Thelamoun, For he on Hector was so cruel founde: Þei ?af to hym many blody wounde, Til on of hem, namyd Dyndaron, Hath so fer amonge þe rengis goon, And born hym so, only of manhede, Þat he hath wonne a passynge mi?ti stede, And brou?t to Hector, sothly, þer he stood, Amonge Grekis al baþed in her blood. Þe whiche in hast, ful kny?tly he be-strood, And amonge hem, lik Mars hym silf he rood, Ful many Greke makynge for to sterue; And with his swerd, whetted for to kerue, He daunted hath her envious pride: Til Dephebus entrid in a-syde In-to þe feld, wiþ a kny?tly chere, And with hym brou?t many good archer Of Poeme, [which] with her arowis kene, And with feþeris of pecok, fresche &amp; schene, Vp-on Grekis han þe feld recured;— In her schot þei wer so moche assured, Þat þoru? mail and þikke plate of stele Þei percyd han her harneis euerydel. And Dephebus, ful like a manly man, To kyng Teutran on hors[e]-bak þo ran, And furiously gan his swerd enbrace, And wounded hym euene amyd þe face Þoru? þe viser—in his felle tene— On hors[e]-bak he my?t[e] nat sustene. And þus Troyens on Grekis arn y-ronne, Þat þei ageyn han þe feld I-wonne— Þei wern on hem so Irous and so wood: But Theseus ful kny?tly hem with-stood With þo kny?tes þat he with hym ladde. And, as I rede, Hector a broþer hadde, Þe stori seith, þat hi?t[e] Quyntylene, ?onge, fresche, &amp; lusty, armyd bri?t &amp; schene, Whiche with þe kyng callid Modernus Is proudly falle vp-on Theseus; And þese tweyne, to-gidre of assent, Be falle on hym with gret avisement, Þat, finally, to his vnhappy chaunce, Þoru? her kny?thod þei brou?t him to outtraunce, And cast[e] schortly þat he schal be ded: Of whos purpos, as Hector gan take hed, He vn-to hem, of verray genterye, With al his my?t loude gan to crye, Besechyng hem for no þing þat he deye; And louly þei his biddyng dide obeye, And hem with-drawe for to do vengance; For Hector had fully remembraunce How Theseus, þe same day to-forn, Toward hym so goodly had hym born, Whan he hym sawe in meschef &amp; distresse, And kny?tly þou?t quite his gentillesse, Lik as it longeth to euery gentil-man. And Theseus ful lowly tho be-gan To þank[e] Hector, þat he was eskapid. But kyng Thoas þo hath fast[e] rapid In-to þe feld, with oþer kny?tes manye, And specialy with hem of Calydonye Cam Philotheas, þe my?ty kyng also, A-geyn[es] Troyens for to haue a-do. And, first, Thoas with a spere ran Furiously to Cassybellan, Oon of þe sonys of kyng Priamus, And ?af hym þo a wounde so grevous, With-oute recure þat he fil doun dede; Of whiche strok, whan Hector gan take hede, In his herte gan his deth compleyne, And in al hast dide his besy peyne On his broþer avenge him ?if he my?t; And many oon he made to a-li?t, Þoru? his kny?thood, from his hors[e]-bak, Þat, sothfastly, al went vn-to wrak On Grekis side, what cam in his way, So worþily he bar hym al þat day. Til duk Nestor is entrid in-to fi?t With five þousand in stele armyd bri?t, Agein[es] Troyens Grekis to socure; And with hym mette, of verray aventure, Þe kyng Esdras, so my?ti and so bold, And kyng Phyon in his char of gold, With al þe worþi noble chiualrye Þat from Agresta cam with Ieconye, Þe kynges sone, of þe same lond, Ful renomed &amp; worþi of his honde. And as þei semble, &amp; to-gidre ran, Þe same tyme, many worþi man Hath lost his lyf vp-on ouþer syde; And of slau?ter, with large woundis wide, Al þe soil, of bodyes þat lay dede, Lyk a ryuer ran with stremys rede, With her cheris grisly, pale, and fade, Þat in þe blod men my?t goon &amp; wade To þe ancle: þe slau?ter was so huge. And kyng Phion, socure and refuge Vn-to Troyens, so bare hym in þat strife, Þat many Greke he made lese his life Þe same day, so wel his swerd was whet; But he, vnwarly, so sore was be-set With multitude of Grekis rounde aboute, Þat of his lyf he pleynly stood in doute: For lykly was he my?t[e] nat eskape, And of Grekis he schuld anoon be take, Nadde he ben holp of worþi Ieconye, Þat to Esdras loude gan to crye: “Allas!” quod he, of routhe and pite, “Worþi Phion þe kyng schal take be Amonge Grekis, þoru? ?oure necligence, But in al hast ?e do ?oure dilligence For to reskue þis noble worþi kyng!” And alle attonys, with-oute more tariyng, Maugre alle þo þat made resistence, From Grekis swerd, be my?ti violence Þei han reskued þe noble kyng Phion; And at his large with hem he is goon, Of his eskape wonder glad and li?t. And Hector þanne with many lusti kny?t Retourned is, and Dephebus also, Pollydamas, &amp; many anoþer mo [Of] Troyan kny?tes, þat desyre newe Grekis to make sore for to rewe: For, of assent, þei fully hem purpose In swiche meschef Grekis to enclose, Þat, ?if þei my?t, fewe schulde eskape. And þer-vp-on, kny?tly þei hem schape, And hem be-gan freschely for to assaille, Þat in þe feld Grekis gan to faille Of her power, and to lese her londe, Þat, finally, þoru? þe my?ti honde, And þe force of Troyanysche kny?tes, Þe Grekis had, maugre al her my?tes, Be brou?t þat day to confusioun. But Menelay and kyng Thelamoun, Whan þei hem sawe feblyn and apeire, Þei of kny?thod made hem to repeire; And so lik men þei han hem silf diffendid, Til Eneas from Troye is discendid With Ewfremus þe duk, þe manly man; And with her kny?tes of newe þei be-gan Efte ageyn Grekis to oppresse. And Hector ay, þoru? his worþinesse, Lyk a lyoun, with a sterne face, Euere in oon so gan hem to enchase, Þat compellid of necessite Þei wern echon a-forn his swerd to fle, And constreyned, ri?t of verray nede. Of whiche þing whan Aiax gan take hede, Hadde in herte grete compassioun To sen þe slau?ter and confusioun On Grekis side, Guydo maketh mynde, And gan to loke at his bak be-hynde, And sawe wher many warde stood a-brod, And many baner &amp; penoun þat a-bood Amyd þe feld, hole and nat forbroke, Þat redy wern attonis to be wroke, ?if nede were, on hem of Troye toun; In whiche wardis, with-oute excepcioun, Was hool þe flour of Grekis chiualrie. To whom, anoon, Aiax gan hym hi?e, As he þat was sore in herte agrevid; And with his crye he hath hem so commevid, Þat þei enhast hem to com to rescus, Amongis whom was þere no refus. And as faste as þei gan assemble, Of noyse of hors þe erþe gan to tremble, Furiously as þei to-gidre flinge: Þere my?t men þe here ryng Of speris scharp, þoru? þe harneis born, And þoru? scheldis, wrou?t of stele &amp; horn, In-to þe brest, sturdy, squar, &amp; brood; And þer, I finde, how þat Aiax rood To Eneas, and he to hym also, So gret envie was a-twixe hem two, Þat [nat] but deth my?t her Ire apese: For in hert nouþer my?t han ese, Til with speris scharp[e] grounde &amp; whet, On hors[e]-bak þei han to-gidre met. And at coupyng so sore þei han hit, Þat eueryche oþer to þe erþe smyt, Þat to beholde was a kny?tly si?t. And after [þat] þei boþe on fote fi?t, Be liklyhede, in her wood[e] rage, Ouþer to falle in ful grete damage Amonge þe hors, be-cause þat þei stood Vp-on þe soil, al ouersprad with blood; But Philoteas is to Aiax come, And hath hym vp amonge þe hors I-nome, And kny?tly fau?t, as makid is memorie. And, sothly, ellis Troyens with victorie Hadde had þe feld, pleinly for to seyne, Til Philoteas with his wardis tweyne, Euene in þe face, manly hem with-stood; And with a spere he first to Hector rood, And vp-on hym þe schafte, I finde, he brak: But, sothly, he vp-on his hors[e]-bak Kepte hym so wel, for al þat fel[le] stroke Remevinge nat, but sturdy as an oke Sat in his sadel vp-ri?t with his chyne; And with a spere, ri?t as any lyne, In-to body, depe þoru? þe schelde, Philoteas he smote in-to þe felde, Þat of his lyf his kny?tes wern in doute. But þo cam in, with so gret a route, Kyng Humerus, and Vlixes eke, And with hem brou?t many worþi Greke— Ten þousand kny?tes, manly men echon, Þat gan Troyens [for] to assaille anoon; And cruelly, on euery halfe certeyn, With multitude þei han hem so be-leyn, Þat dispeired and disconsolat, And of longe fi?t awaped and amat, Gan with-drawe, faynted in bataille; And eke her hors, sothly, gonne faille, Þat on her syde al went vp-so-doun. But Paris þo, with hem of Troye toun Is entrid in, in ful manly wyse; And first he met with þe kyng of Fryse, Þat to Vlixes was ny?e of allye, Whom Paris smot with so gret envie, Þat he hym slowe; wher-of Grekis were Sore abavid; and aftir, with a spere, Vlixes rood to avenge hym ?if he my?t. And, first, whan he of Paris had a si?t, In-to þe reste he gan his spere þrowe, Þat, finally (for he bare to lowe), Failyng of Paris, sothly, as I rede, Vnder hym he slowe his my?ti stede, Þat maugre hym he to grounde is goon. And he on hym wolde haue falle anoon, But Troylus þo mette hym in þe berde, And furiously with his scharpe swerde He smote Vlixes þoru?-out his viser, Þat lyk a condut or a smal river, Doun by his face, of blood þe stremys ran. But Vlixes, lik a manly man, Of þat strok astonyd nat at al, But on his stede, stif as any wal, With his swerde so my?tely gan race Þoru? þe vmbrere in-to Troylus face, Þat he hym ?af a large mortal wounde: Of whiche strok, passyngly Iocounde Þe Grekis wern, supposyng, in her þou?t, How þat Troyens finally were brou?t Vn-to outtraunce. And sothly so þei hadde, Saue þat Hector, with kny?tes which he ladde, And with hym eke Paris and Dephebus, And alle his breþer, in kny?thod most famus, Troylus also, for al his last[e] wounde, Þat was alweie so noble a kny?t I-founde, Alle attonys, Ioyned in-to oon, Vp-on Grekis sodeinly be goon. And worþi Hector aldir-first be-gan Grekis to enchase, þat a-forn hym ran, Lik as bestis þat fled fro þe deth; And euere in on, with his swerde he sleth Whom he mette, or durst his strok abide; And on his foon, with fresche woundis wide, Þe slau?ter he made alweie to renewe. And þilk[e] day, in blody rosen hewe He hath her platis &amp; her harneis steyned; And þou? it hadde blood fro heuene reined, Þe soil reddere my?t[e] nou?t a ben: And ay I-liche, as a swarme of been, Þe Grekis flokmel fled out of his way. And Guydo seith, al þat ilke day Hector hadde, formest on þe plein, In þe frounter of þe Grekis leyn, Þat be-hynde, þe kny?tes of his garde For lak of hym wern alle out of warde. Wherfore, whan he hadde fou?t[e] longe, And Grekis sawe of newe wexe strong, To his kny?tes he is a?en repeired, Whiche in hem silf gretly wer dispeired For his absence; but þo whan þei him sen, Ful inwardly recomforted ben, And with glad hert han her lord received. And her gladnes whan he hath perceiwed, Spak vn-to hem ful effectuously, And praied hem ful benygnely, To remembre kny?tly in her herte, And considre wysly, and aduerte, First, þe wrongis þat Grekis han hem do Of ?ore ago, and ouermore also ?if Grekis had þilke day victorie, Far-wel for ay þe honour and þe glorie Of Troyan blod, in conclusioun:— “For, finally, we and eke oure toun Schal mortally tourne to ruyne; And oure honour, þat was wont to schine Þoru?-oute þe world, &amp; oure worþines, Eclipse schal, and tourne to dirknes, But ?e þis day like as men ?ow quite. Wherefore I pray, þat no man atwite ?oure hi?e renoun of any cowardyse, To sette vp-on in ful manly wyse, And nat to spare for drede of deth, I pray.” And þei echon ful lowly gan obeie To his desire, with-oute lenger tale; And entringe in by a certeyn vale, Vp-on Grekis, þese worþi kny?tes alle, Folwyng Hector, sodeynly ben falle, Ful mortally, or þat þei wer ware. And Hector þo no Greke wolde spare, But euery-where, to her confusioun, He killed &amp; slow?e aboute hym enviroun; And his kny?tes, ridyng be his syde, Made her fomen, maugre al her pride, To lese her lond, &amp; flen out of her si?te: Til þat þe kyng whiche Thoas hi?t, On Grekis side, inward gan hym dresse, And of newe ful kny?tly oppresse Hem of Troye, þis kyng, þis manly man, Þat had a-forn slawe Cassibelan, Oon of þe sonys of kyng Priamvs. But as he rood, of fortune it fel þus: Þat alle þe breþer on a frusche he mette, Whiche of assent enviroun hym be-sette, And from his sadil—þat many [Greke] be-hilde— Amonge þe hors smet hym in-to þe feld; And of þei rent first his basenet, And cruelly þei had his hede of smet— For he vnarmyd al at meschef stood— Saue þat þe duke, furious and wood, Of Athenys, rydyng a gret paas, Reskued hym in þis mortal cas With his kny?tes þat aboute him rood. And hym to helpe, with-oute more abood, With a spere, scharpe whet and kene, First of al he fil on Quyntylene, Þat besy was Thoas to haue slawe; And þe breþre he made also with-drawe, Whan Quyntylene of his hors was þrow. But Paris þo drow vp his my?ti bowe, And to þis duke lete an harowe glide, And þoru? his platis hit hym in þe side Vp-on a rib, þat made hym sore blede; Of whiche strok he ne toke noon hede Be-cause only þat he so fervent was Amyd his foon to helpe kyng Thoas, Amonge þe horse þat was bore to grounde, In point of deth, with many mortal wounde, Only for he was naked on þe hede: But þis duke, ful[ly] deuoide of drede, Of his kny?thood in þis perlous cas, Amyd his foon hath holp[e] kyng Thoas, And with his lyf made him skape fre. And Hector ay, of cruel enmyte I-lyche fresche, for no þing wolde leue Vp-on Grekis his manhood for to preue, Enforcyng hym to her distruccioun: And, as he rood amonge hem vp &amp; doun, Kyng Humerus hath a bowe take, And to schete gan hym redy make, And hatfully þer-in set an arwe; And to Hector he marked haþ so narwe, Þat he smote hym euene amyd þe face: But or he my?t any ferther pace, Hector smet hym with so gret a peyne, Þat with his swerd he rof his hed atweyne. Þe deth of whom whan þe Grekis knowe, Myn auctor seith, þei han an horn I-blowe, Þat vnwarly, with þat dredful sowne, Seuene þousand kny?tes cam attonys doun Aboute Hector, with-oute more abood; But he of force þoru? hem alle he rood, Maugre her my?t, þat hym þo with-sette, And slowe alle þo þat his weie lette, And stynt[e] nat, pleynly, til he cam To his fader, þe worþi kyng Priam, With many worþi, ful famvs of renoun, Þat with his kny?tes fast[e] by þe toun Lay al þe day, with men on hors &amp; fote, As he þat was of kny?thod crop &amp; rote, And kepte hym cloos, of [ful] hi?e prudence— Til Hector cam vn-to his presence And hym besou?t, in þis grete nede, With þre þousand þat he wold hym spede Vp-on Grekis in her felle rage, To falle on hem at most avauntage. Howe the Kenge Pryamus of Troye kynghtly enterde in-to þe felde at the requeste of Ectore. And þanne in haste, þis worþi Priamvs, With his kny?tes fresche and desyrous, Towarde Grekis hath þe weye take, And swyche a mordre gan vp-on hem make, Þat many Greke lay ded on þe pleyn: For Priamus so sore hath hem be-leyn, On euery half, þoru? his grete my?t, Þat þei ful fast fled out of his si?t, So sore of newe he vp-on hem sette. And, as I finde, þer to-gidre mette Hector and Aiax, of verray auenture; And on her stedis, strong &amp; wonder sure, Þe story seith, in al þe hast þei konne, Lyke wode lyouns þei to-gidre ronne With so gret my?t, þat, wer þei lefe or loþe, Vp-on þe pleyn þei wer vnhorsed boþe. And in þis while, Menelay þe kyng, Sodeinly, as he cam rydyng, He slowe of Troye a worþi ameral. And þus þe slau?ter, passyngly mortal, Renewed ay: for Celydonas Þe nevew slow of þe kyng Thoas; And Madan mette, myn auctor writeþ þus, A Grekysche kyng callid Cedyus, Whiche with his swerd swiche a strok him set, Þat þoru? þe vmbrere out his eye he smet; And Sardellus, þat was of Troye eke, Þe same while slowe a worþi Greke, A lord of name, and of hye prowes, Al-þei Guydo his name nat expres. And þanne also cam Margaritoun, On Troye side, ageyn Thelamoun; And boþe two, inly set a-fire Of hi?e disdeyn and of hatful Ire,— As þei mette on horse-bak y-fere, Kyng Thelamoun, sothly, as I lere, ?af vn-to hym a wounde ful cruel. But þo cam in þe Troyan Phanuel, And Prothenor smot doun of his stede: And þus þe sonys, pleynly, as I rede, Of Priamus, no þing disamaied, Þe Grekis han on euery part outtraied, And so kny?tly al þe day hem born, Þat many Greke fatally haþ lorn His lif, in soth, of hate and enmyte. And kyng Duglas is falle on Meneste, Of Attenys duke and gouernour; And with a spere, of Ire and old rancour, He ran at hym, &amp; smet hym myd þe schelde: But for al þat, his sadil ?it he hilde; And for þe duk spere hadde noon, He with a swerd to Duglas rood anoon, And þoru? þe vmbrere rof of ny?e his nase, Þat he astonyd stood as in a mase, Whan þat he sawe þe conduit of his blood So stremyn out; but, for al þat, he rood Out a-side, fully deuoide of fere, In-to tyme þat he staunched were. But Deamor, his owne broþer dere, Whan he behild his mortal blody chere, Of hi?e disdeyn he rood to Meneste, And hym vnhorseth; but vp anon sterte he, And or he my?t fully vp arise, A-noþer broþer in ful cruel wyse Is falle on hym, so þat of hem þre Attonys wern vp-on Meneste, Fully in purpos he schal lese his lyf. But he so kny?tly bar hym in þat strife Ageyn[e]s hem, þat wonder was to se; And vp-on hym most cruel of hem þre Was on Thoras, eldest of echon, Whiche him to haue slaw was besi euer in on: For al to-broke þei han his basenet. But whan þat Teuter saw hym so be-set —A Grekisch kyng, as made is mencioun,— Hadde in his herte grete compassioun, And þou?t[e], pleinly, of manhod him releve, And, ?if he my?t, his fomen for to greve. But al for nou?t was his besy peyne: For Hector þo fil on boþe tweyne, Vp-on Teuter and on Meneste, And had hem slayn, nad[de] Aiax be, Whiche vn-to Hector ffaste gan hym hi?e, A þousand kny?tes in his companye, To with-stonde hym, and Meneste to saue From his hondis, ?if he my?t him haue. But Paris þo, and þe kyng of Perse, With five þousand, as I can reherse, Of worþi kny?tes, &amp; many Troyan mo, Be vn-to Hector alle attonys go, In þrifty wyse ridyng on a rowe: For Paris made a trompet to be blowe, At whiche þer cam, kny?tly enbatailled, Many Troyan, ful wel apparailled, Whiche in þe feld of Hector wer conueied; For of oon herte þei fully han obeied Vn-to þe biddynge of þis Troyan kny?t, Al fresche and newe to begynne a fi?t Vp-on Grekis, as ferforþe as þei can, Of whom was slayn many manly man. And ay þe slau?tre pitously reneweth, Þat many Greke sore in herte reweth Her gret[e] los and distruccioun, Wrou?t vp-on hem by hem of Troye toun, And specially of Hector, as I finde, Whiche on þat day, as Dares makeþ mynde, With his hond a þousand kny?tes slowe, Þat neuer wern adawed of her swowe: For Greke dar noon in his weye dwelle; For with his swerd he koude hem so compelle To lese her grounde, of necessite, And like as schepe a-fore þe wolf [to] fle. Of the Irouse langage that Ectore had to Meryon the Kynge, and howe he sclewe hym. And, as I rede, amyd of his victorie, Hector mette vnder a tentorie Amonge Grekis Merioun þe kyng, To whom he spake, with-oute more tariyng: “O þow traytour, þe hour aprocheþ faste, For þow arte come, sothly, to þi laste, Þi fatal day hath his cours I-ronne! For trust[e] wel, or westring of þe sonne I cast[e], platly, to quite þe þi mede, And with my swerd [in haste] þi blood to schede: For þou so bolde were on me to-day To lettyn me of my riche praye At þe spoilynge of kyng Patroclus— Þat for cause þou were presumptuous Me to distourbe, þou schalt anon be ded.” And doun he stirte, &amp; smote of first his hed, And hym to spoille also gan hym haste; But Meneste cam on hym as faste, Whan he be-hilde trauerse at his bake, And with a spere, [in] whiche was no lake, Smot hym in with grete violence, With-oute si?t, or any aduertence Of worþi Hector, or any takynge hede, Þe wounde of whom sore gan to blede. But out he went, and made it faste bynde; And Meneste stale a-weye be-hynde, Nat in purpos, sothly, ?if he may, To mete Hector of al þat ilke day. But whan þat he was [y-]bonde sore, His wounde staunche, þat it bled no more, More furious þan euere he was to-forn, Repeired is, with anger al to-torne (So ay þe Ire on his hert[e] fret), Þat he bar doun al þat euere he met— Sleth &amp; kylleth, he was so mercyles, Alle þo þat put hem silf in pres, Or hardy wern with hym for to mete. For in his boke lik as writ Darete, For verray soth, and in þe stori seith (?if it be so þat men may ?eue feyth And credence of possibilite, As in Guydo clerly ?e may se), Aftir þat he cau?t his lattre wounde, Finally Grekis to confounde —So as it is affermed in certeyn— A þousand kny?tes with his hond wer slayn, With-oute hem þo, þat I spak of rath! And newe alweye he gan his swerd to baþe In Grekis blod, þat sodeinly þei be So ouer-layn þoru? his cruelte, Þat Greke was noon, of hi?e nor lowe estat, Þat he ne was a-whaped and amaat, Of his kny?thod and manly excellence: For þer was non to make resistence, Nor outterly, þat durst[e] take on honde Of al þat day Hector to with-stonde. And as it is also made mencioun, Þilke day kyng Agamenoun, As seith Guydo, cam nat in[-to] þe felde, For causes gret his presence he with-helde, On Grekis side þat al goth vp-so-doun: Hector on hem so pleyeth þe lyon, Þat to her tentes þei fled for socours. And þei of Troye, proudly as victours, Sued aftir, by tracis of her blood; And þer þei wan tresour &amp; gret good, And spoiled hem, in ful gret distresse, Of her armour and of her richesse, And felle on hem, or þat þei were ware, And home to Troye al þe good þei bare. For, finally, þat day wiþ meschaunce Grekis had be brou?t vn-to outtraunce, With-oute recure, in soth, for euere-more, On euery parte þei were be-leyn so sore Þoru? þe manhod of Hector, &amp; þe my?t, With helpe of many oþer worþi kny?t, Þat so felly ageyn Grekis wrou?t: For to swiche meschef, pleinly, þei hem brou?t, Þat nad[de] ben her owne pitous slouthe, Of pride only, and of foly routhe, Þei had of hem, at her volunte, Þat day for euere hadde þe souereynte, And recured, þoru? her hi?e renoun, Lordschip of hem and domynacioun, Whiche schuld haue laste, &amp; be contynuel, Victoriously and perpetuel Haue endurid; saue cruel Fate Is redy ay with Fortune, to debate Ageyn þinges þat gynne in wilfulnes, To make hem fyne ay in wrechidnes, Þoru? her envious disposicioun Of sodeyn chaunge and reuolucioun, And vnwar tournyng of hir false whele, Þat wil nat bide whan a þing is wele— Allas, freel, deuoide of sikernesse. Þe cause was dymmed wiþ dirknesse, Þat hath Troyens þoru? false oppinioun I-blended so in her discresioun, And specially fordirked so þe si?t Of worþi Hector, þe prudent manly kny?t, To sen a-forn what schuld after swe, Be good avis þe meschef to eschewe Þat folwid hem at þe bak be-hynde. Allas! þei wern wilfully made blynde, The same day, whan þei set[e] softe Be victorie on þe hille a-lofte, Þat þei nat koude of necligence se Þe aftir-fal of her felicite— So put a-bak was her aduertence For lak of resoun and of hi?e prudence: For þei her hap han voided, &amp; her grace, Þat presently were sette a-fore her face. For, in a man is nat commendable, ?if Fortune be to hym fauourable And blaundischinge, with a forhede clere, To smyle on hym with a plesaunt chere, Only of fauour for to help hym oute, Whan he in meschef is be-set aboute— ?if he refuse his hap of wilfulnes, Fortune avoidynge þoru? vnkynd[e]nes Whan sche mynystreþ to hym of hir grace: Anoþer tyme he schal hir nat embrace, Whan he hath nede to hir helpe at al, To socour hym or he cacche a fal; But raþer þan, for his ingratitude, Frowardly, with mowes hym delude, Whan he best weneþ stond in sikernes. Fortune is ay so ful of brotulnes, Remewable, and redy for to flitte Hir welful hour, þat who list nat amytte With hir fauour for to ben allied, Anoþer tyme it schal be denyed, Whan he wer leuest finde hir fauourable: For in some hour, sothly, þis no fable, Vn-to som man sche graunteþ his desires, Þat wil nat after in a þousand ?eres, Parauenture, onys condiscende Vn-to his wil, nor his lust hym sende, As it hath falle þis day vnhappily To worþi Hector, þat so wilfully Wrou?t of hede Grekis for to spare, Fatally whan þei were in þe snare. For he of hem, like a conqueroure, With victorie, trivmphe, and honour Mi?t haue brou?t, þoru? his hi?e renoun, Þe palme of conquest in-to Troye toun, Whiche he þat day reffusid folily. Howe worthy Ector infortunately lefte the felde at þe requeste of his Cosyne, Thelamonus Aiax. For, as he rood, þis Hector, cruelly Amonge Grekis slowe and bar al doun,— Casuely he mette Thelamoun, I mene Aiax, ny?e of his allye, Þat of hate and cruel hoot envie To Hector rood, like as he were wood, Al-be to hym he was [ful] ny?e of blod; ?it, for al þat, þis ?ong[e] lusty kny?t Dide his power &amp; his fulle my?t, With-oute feynyng, to haue born hym doun (Whos fader hi?t also Thelamoun, Þat hym be-gat, þe stori telleth þus, Of Exioun, suster to Priamvs). And þis Aiax, flourynge in ?onge age, Fresche and delyuer, and of gret corage, Sette on Hector, of kny?tly hi?e prowes; And, as þei mette, boþe in her wodnes, On her stedis, þis manly champiouns, Eueryche on oþer lik tigers or lyons Be-gan to falle, and proudly to assaille, And furiously seuere plate and maille,— First with speris, longe, large, &amp; rounde, And aftirwarde with swerdis kene grounde: And fi?tyng þus, longe þei contune. Til it be-fil of cas or [of] fortune, Tokne or signe, or som apparence, Or by Naturis kyndly influence, Whiche in-to hertis doþe ful depe myne, Namly of hem þat born ben of o lyne, Which cause was, paraunter, of þis tweyne, Naturelly her rancour to restreyne, And her Ire for to modefie— Only for þei so ny?e were of allye, Vnwist of ouþer, and þer-of vnsure, Til þei wer tau?te, only of Nature: For naturelly blod wil ay of kynde Draw vn-to blod, wher he may it fynde, Whiche made Hector kyndly to aduerte, To be mevid and sterid in his herte, Bothe of kny?thod and of gentilnes, Whan he of Aiax sawe þe worþines— Spak vn-to hym ful benygnely, And seide: “cosyn, I seye þe trew[e]ly, ?if þou list Grekis here forsake, And come to Troye, I dare vndirtake, To þin allyes and to þi kynrede Þou schalt be þere, with-outen any drede, Ful wel receyved, in party &amp; in al, Of hem þat ben of þe blood royal Sothly discendid, and hyest of degre, Þat it of ri?t schal suffise vn-to þe, And kynd[e]ly be to þe plesaunce For to repeire to þin allyaunce— To gentil herte sith no þing is so good As be confederid with his owne blood; For I conceyue be þe worþines, Whiche Nature doth in þe expresse, Of Troyan blood þat þou arte descendid, Whiche of Grekis long hath be offendid: Wherfore, I rede to leue hem outterly.” And he answered ageyn ful humblely, Þat sithen he of berthe was a Greke, And was of ?ouþe amonge hem fostered eke From þe tyme of his natiuite, And taken had þe ordre and degre Of kny?thood eke amongis hem a-forn, And, ouer þis, bounde was and sworn To be trewe to her nacioun, Makyng of blood noon excepcioun, He swore he wold conserven his beheste; And to Hector he made þis requeste: Þat ?if þat he of manful gentilnes, Wolde of kny?thood and of worþines Shewe vn-to hym so gret affeccioun, To make hem þat wer of Troye toun Only with-drawe Grekis to pursewe, And fro her tentis make hem to remewe, And resorte ageyn vn-to þe toun, Of kny?tly routhe and compassioun, With-oute assailyng, or any more affray Made on Grekis for þat ilke day, Sith vn-to hem ou?t I-now? suffice Þat of þe felde, in so kny?tly wyse, Þei were of manhood fully possessours, And of her fomen finally victours, Lyk as to-forn fully is diffinyd. To whos requeste Hector is enclyned (Allas þe while!) of hasty wilfulnes, And made anoon, with-oute avysenes, Mid þe felde a trompet for to blowe, Wher-by Troyens fully my?te knowe Þat be his wil þei schulde hem with-draw— Aftir þe custom, pl[e]ynly, and þe lawe, And þe vsaunce, boþe ny? and ferre, Amongis hem þat ben expert in werre— Whan þei were moste fervent for to fi?t, Vp-on Grekis for to preue her my?t, And had hem chacid lowe to þe stronde, Þat þei wer weyke of power to with-stonde: For þei of Troye, alle of o desire, Gan settyn on with schot of wyld[e] fire To brenne her schippis, &amp; of hi?e meschaunce Finally to putte hem at outtraunce. And so þei had, þis þe verray trouthe, Nadde Hector had vppon hem routh, Makynge Troyens repeire to þe toun, Vngraciously, to her confusioun, As þe story schal aftir specefie. For þo he putte, allas, in iuparte Life and deth, whiche my?t haue be sure, Þe whiche ageyn þei neuere schal recure. Þei han mater to compleyne sore: For fro þat day, fare-wel for euere-more Victorie &amp; laude fro hem of þe toun, To hem denyed by disposicioun Of mortal fate, whiche was contrarie —In þis mater me liste no lenger tarie— For þei of Troye ben entrid her cyte, And schet her gatis for more surete; For of þat day, [lyk] as made is mynde, Þis was þe ende, in Guydo as I fynde— Þei wende haue do, paraunter, for þe beste. And whan þe sonne was I-go to reste, Þei toke her ese al þat ilke ny?t, Til on þe morwe Tytan, clere &amp; bri?t, Schadde his bemys on her Emysperye, Makynge þe day for to schewe myrie, At whiche tyme Troyens anoon ri?t —Þei þat wer hool and lusty for to fi?t— Gan armen hem in purpos ful þat day Her foon to mete, platly, ?if þei may: For þat was hool her wil &amp; pleyn entent. And eke þei hadden in commaundement To-forn of Hector redy hem to make, Oute of her slepe amorwe whan þei wake, Of whiche þing þei were nat necligent; But to Pryam þe Grekis haue I-sent Her messageris þe same day or prime, To take trewe, only for þe tyme Of ei?t[e] wekes; þe whiche Priamus, Be assent of Hector, þe story telleth þus, Hath graunted hem, and by auctorite Of þe wysest þat wern in þat cite. In whiche tyme, while þei leiser haue, Þe Grekis gan [for] to burye and graue Þe bodyes þat a-forn were slawe, Lyke þe rytes in her paynym lawe, With al her my?t and her besy cure; For some brent, and by sepulture Enclosed wern, liche her estat in al: And þus þei hilde þe feste funeral Fro day to day duryng ay þe pes, In whiche space, I fynde, how Achilles Of Patroclus þe deth hath sore pleined, As he þat was with teris al be-reined, So inwardly he loued hym in his herte, Þat for þe anguysche &amp; þe cruel smerte He longe abood in lamentacioun, And dide make, by grete affeccioun, A large toumbe for a remembraunce, Mid þe feld, as þo was þe vsaunce Among Grekis, with grete reuerence, Liche þe honour and þe excellence Of royal buriyng: so þis Patroclus I-graue was, and Protheselaus, In her toumbes corve of marbil gray; And ny?e to-gidre in a plein þei lay, Þe werke aboute hem richely I-wrou?t; And to þe erthe þei wer to-gider brou?t Solempnely, liche þe obseruaunces Of her rytis, with þe circumstaunces Of Grekis vsid, sothly, in þo dawes, Fro poynt to point as longeþ to her lawes, Of swiche as wern of þe estat royal: So holden was þe feste funeral Of þis two, whil þe trewe doth laste. And þei of Troy besied hem ful faste, With al her my?t and her besy cure, Her grene hurtis &amp; woundes for to cure, Be avis of hem þat wern in surgerie Ful wel expert to schape remedie, Her swol[le] soris to soften of her peyne, Þat in þe space of þis monþis tweyne Þei wer restored to helþe in euery þing. In whiche tyme, Priamus þe kyng Swiche sorwe made for Cassibellan In his hert, þat no wi?t ne can. Hym recounforte of his hevynesse: For day by day, of inward tendirnesse, Ful pitously he gan to sobbe &amp; wepe; And þe body he made for to kepe Aboue þe erthe for a certeyn space, Til he had chosen oute a place To his buriynge and his sepulture. And, as Guydo vs fully doth assure, In Venus temple, ryche as any shryne, He made his werkmen a toumbe for to myne, In marbil gray and metal rychely, In whiche he putte ful solempnely Þe dede cors of þis Cassibellan, Beynge present ful many manly man, In þe phane of Cytherea. Howe Cassandra the prophitesse lamantably tolde þe Troyans þere deststruxion, for þe which þay emprisonde her. In whiche þing, whan þat Cassandra With-Inne hir silfe considered &amp; beheld, And saw vp offrid his helm &amp; his sheld, His swerd also, and vn-to Mars his stede, Of inward wo sche felt hir herte blede, Herynge þe noise and þe pitous crye, Þe tendre weping &amp; sorwynge outterly Of hem of Troye, and lamentacioun Whiche for her frendis, þoru?-oute al þe toun, Þei gan to make, þat wer slawe a-fore:— With sodeyn rage her herte was to-tore, So inwardly, sche my?t hir nat restreyne Furiously to cryen and compleine, And seide, “allas!” ful ofte, &amp; “wellawey!” “O woful wrecchis þat ?e be þis day, Vnhappy eke, and graceles also, Infortunat and inly wo-be-go!— How may ?e suffre þe grete harmys kene Whiche ?e ar likly her-after to sustene Durynge þe sege, in þis toun be-loke, Seynge ?our foon, redy to be wroke, Aboute ?ou, beset on euery side, To be vengid on ?oure grete pride?

Eleyne of vs, allas! is bou?t to dere, Sith for hir sake we schul euerychon, Pore &amp; riche, I excepte noon, An ende make, woful and pitous: Þe Ire of hem schal be so furious Vp-on vs alle, þer is noon oþer mene Sauf only deth vs to go betwene!” Þis was þe noise and þe pitous cry Of Cassandra, þat so dredfully Sche gan to make aboute in euery strete Þoru? þe toun, whom-euer sche my?t mete, Lyk as sche had ben oute of hir mynde, Til Priamus fast[e] made hir bynde, And schettyn vp—it was þe more rou?th— Sche was nat herde, al-be sche seide trou?[t]h: For nouþer wisdam nor discrecioun, Counseil nor wit, prudence nor resoun, Trouth nor rede—with-outen any lye,— Nor þe spirite of trewe proficye, Availeth nat,—nor al swiche sapience, In place wher þer is noon audience. For, be a man inly neuere so wys In counseillynge, or in hy?e devys In werkynge, ouþer in elloquence, Eche þing to sen in his aduertence Or it be falle, a-forn in his resoun, Amyd þe eye of his discreccioun,— ?et for al þis (it is þe more dool), With-oute fauour, he holde is but a fool: For vnfavored, wysdam vaileþ nou?t, Nouþer trouth, how dere þat it be bou?t, Liche as Cassandra, for al hir wyse rede, Dispised was, &amp; taken of noon hede Of hem of Troye, to her confusioun, But cruelly y-þrowen in prisoun, Where a whyle I wele leue hir dwelle, And of Grekis furth I wil ?ou telle. Pallamydes gruchede agayns them that choyes Kynge Agamenon to haue domynacyon of þe Grekis. And, first of al, how Pallamydes Gan to gruche ageyn[e]s hem þat ches— He beynge absent—kyng Agamenoun To haue lordschip or dominacioun On hem alle; namly, sith þat he Was nat worþi to suche dygnyte, For to gouerne so gret a my?ty host, Þoru?-out þe world come from euery cost, Of kynges, princes, so worþi of renoun: For he þer-of had indignacioun, And seide him silf was of more pouste Amonge Grekis, and gretter of degre— Concludynge þat, be no maner weye, To his power he nolde nat obeye In pes nor werre, as be subieccioun, Sith he ne was at his eleccioun— Platly affermynge how þer wer but þre, Whan he was chose, kynges of degre, Where-as þritty wer þat tyme absent; For whiche he swore, it was nat his entent, Nor acordynge with his oppinioun, In any wyse þat Agamenoun Of Grekis schulde haue swiche gouernaunce. Lo, what meschef lyth in variaunce Amonge lordis, whan þei nat accorde For to drawe fully by o corde: Envie is cause of swiche diuisioun, And couetyse of dominacioun, Þat eueryche wolde surmounte his felaw. Þis cursid vise ofte hath with-drawe Hap &amp; grace, in many regioun: For whan discord &amp; false discencioun Allied ben in hertis for to strive Among lordis, þat kyngdam may nat þryve Til þei reformed ben ageyn to pes Amonge hem silf—pleinly þis no les. Of whiche þing Grekis token hede, And þou?t[e] nat ferþer to procede In þe matere þat Pallamydes I-mevid had amonge[s] alle þe pres, And þoru? her wit þei set al in quiete, And maden hym his rancour for to lete, And to accorde fully in his herte. But now must I my style agein diuerte Vn-to þe werre, and telle þe manere After þe trewe how þei mette I-fere. Howe Agamenon comyttede his wardys to Dyomede and othere. And Ectore prudently, of þe todire syde, was not rekelysse, them to recontyre. Like as þis stori makeþ mencioun, Þe worþi kyng, grete Agamenoun, Whan þe trewes wer passid &amp; I-goon, In al hast he gan ordeyne anon With al his my?t &amp; waker dilligence, Devoide of slouþe &amp; of necligence, To sette his wardis ful a-visely; And to Achille he ful prudently Þe first[e] ward committeþ for to lede, And þe secunde vn-to Dyomede, Þe þridde, also, to kyng Menelay, And þe fourþe, on þe same day, Hadde Meneste, þe duk of Athene, At his ledyng, in stele armyd clene. And oþer wardes, folwyng by &amp; by, Agamenoun þe kyng ful manfully Ordeyned [hath] how þei schal procede, As he þat was in al his werke &amp; dede Ful circumspect, boþe in werre and pes. And worþi Hector was nat rek[e]les To sette his wardis of hem of þe toun In kny?tly wyse, of hi?e discrecioun; And to Troylus—so ?ong, so fresche, &amp; ly?t— Þe firste warde, with many lusty kny?t, He hath assigned, and oþer wardes sette So prudently, þei my?t[e] be no bette. And forþe in haste, hym list no lenger bide, With many worþi ridyng by his side, Oute at þe ?atis he went of þe toun Towarde Grekis, þis troyan champioun. And, firste, whan he sawe þe ferse Achille, He ne koude no lenger kepe hym stille, But smot his hors felly in þe syde, And toward hym cruelly gan ryde; Þe whiche þing, with a dispitous eye, Whan Achilles, sothly, gan aspye, Ageyn Hector, of manful hardynes, With hert envious gan his stede dresse: And in þe felde to-gydere as þei mete, With rounde speris, þe pointis kene whette— At þe encountrynge, of kny?tly excellence, Eueryche oþer, þoru? gret violence, Be verray force bar oþer vn-to grounde, As ful ofte it happeþ, and is founde Whan stronge doþ mete with his parigal: Þer is no more, but euery[ch] had a fal. But Hector first, of strengþe most assurid, His stede ageyn haþ anoon recurid, And lefte Achilles þo of gentilnes; And in gret hast, forþe he gan him dres Amonge Grekis, &amp; wher-so þat he rood, He killed &amp; slou? al þat hym with-stood: For with his swerd he made her woundis wide, And þoru? þe brest, &amp; some þoru? þe side He percid haþ, and waged hem for euere, And brak scheltrons, &amp; made hem to disseuere; For in his hert he þou?t it dide hym good To baþe his swerd in þe Grekis blood. And þis contuneth til þat Achilles Cau?t his stede ageyn amonge þe pres, And entrid in amongis hem of Troye; And with his swerd he made large woye, Slethe and bar doun whom þat euere he mette: For þer was noon hardy hym to lette, Til it be-fil, in his malencolye, Hector he mette ridynge, sodeinly; And whan þei saw eche oþer come a-fer, With-oute a-bood eueryche cau?t a spere, And ran to-gider, þer was no more arest. But Hector first smet him in þe brest, Þat his spere, pleinly (þis no tale), Al to-schyuered in-to pecis smale, Þat Achilles of necessite To grounde goth, it wold non oþer be, And vn-horsed at þe erþe lay. And Hector þan, in al þe hast he may, Enforced hym for to cache his stede, But many [a] Greke, in þis grete nede, Cam to reskus of þis Achilles, And, for his loue, putte hem silfe in pres, Þorou? help of whom his hors he doþ ateyne, Enhastynge hym with al his my?t and peyne To be avenged of his grete Iniurie. And sodeinly in his wode furie, With a swerd ful scharp[e] grounde &amp; whet He smot Hector vp-on þe basenet, Þat from his sadel he made him to remewe, Þe whiche stroke he my?t[e] nat eschewe. But, for al þat, þis noble worþi kny?t, Of verray force, þoru? his grete my?t, Maugre his foon his sadel haþ recurid, As he þat was in manhood most assurid; And sodeinly in hert he wex so wroþe Þat in a rage to Achilles he goþe, And with his swerd so smet hym on þe hede Þoru? þe basenet, þat þe blood al rede Be his face gan to renne doun, Like a ryuer, his chekis enviroun: But he hym silfe diffendiþ as a kny?t. And þo of newe be-gan þe cruel fi?t Atwen hem two, to sen þat it was wonder; For euery stroke, grete as dent of þonder, Range in þe eyre, for non wold oþer spare; And þis þe soth: in her fi?t þei fare Like wode tigres, or bores in her rage, Or sterne bolis, whan þei ben sauage, Þat it sempte, in verray sothfastnes, ?if þes two, so ful of worþines, Contune longe in fi?tynge, &amp; endure, Þe ton or boþe, of cruel auenture, Most haue be dede, of necessite: Þe whiche þing had[de] be pite, Be-cause þei were worþi kny?tes boþe. But while þat þei in fi?tyng, fel &amp; wroþe, Most besy wern, þe Grekis þo begynne With her wardes for to entre Inne; And þei of Troye, þe story makeþ mynde, On her party lefte nou?t be-hynde, But in þe feld enhaste hem euerychon In kny?tly wyse to mete with her foon, Þat with þe prese, here &amp; also ?onder, Þe kny?tes two seuered wern assonder. And þo cam in sterne Dyomede With þe kny?tes whiche he dide lede, Ful lustile, in þe silfe place, With whom haþ mette proudly in þe face Worþi Troylus on his hors[e]-bake, Þat neuer had ?et in manhod lak; And as þei countre, þe story doth vs lere, Eueryche vnhorsid kny?tly hath his fere: But first his hors recureth Dyomede, And in al haste faste gan hym spede Tasaille Troylus, stondynge vpon fote; And whan he saw þer was non oþer bote, As kny?tly ?et as euere dide man, Ageyn[e]s hym diffende hym þo be-gan. But Dyomede, hoot as any fire, Wonder envious, &amp; hatful of desyre, With his swerde, of rancour for þe nonis, Þe riche cercle, ful of ynde stonys, Þat was þat tyme on Troylus basenet, Ful cruelly hath racid of and smet; But Troilus nolde, for al þat, him with-drawe: For hym diffendynge, he hath þe stede slawe On whiche sat þat tyme Dyomede, Þat maugre hym he muste a-li?t[e] nede. And whan þei wern on fote boþe tweine, Þei dide her my?t &amp; her cruel peyne Eueryche of hem oþer to assaille With swerdis scharp; so þat plate &amp; maille Þei gan to seuere and assonder race, As wode lyouns, with mortal chere &amp; face, Til þe Grekis stronge, stoute, &amp; felle, (As myn auctor in his boke can telle) Han þoru? her my?t maked Dyomede Sodeinly to recure a stede; And Troyan kny?tes, on þe toþer side, Han Troilus brou?t a stede for to ride. And whan þei wern horsid boþe two, With-oute more, to-gidre ageyn þei go With stronge foynes, and I-fere ronne Eche at oþer, as felly as þei konne, Til at þe laste, cruel Dyomede (Liche as ?e may in myn auctor rede), Wer it be cas, happe, or auenture, In whiche no man fully may assure, Or by Fortune, with hir false visage, Hadde þat tyme of Troilus avauntage: For he on hym was falle at meschef. Þe whiche þing to him was no repref, Þou? he hym toke, amonge so gret a rout, On euery halfe with Grekis set a-boute; Sith dotous euer is þe fyn of fy?t— Now vp, now doun, now dirke, &amp; after bri?t: For no wy?t may ben ay victorious In pes nor werre, nor ylyche eurous. Late euery man, sith happe is set in doute, Taken his torne as it cometh a-boute; Þou? Troilus now was take of Dyomede, Anoþer tyme he schal him quyte his mede: For as þe story telleþ in þis place, Þis Dyomede but a litel space Troilus lad forþe as prisonere, Þat to reskus, in stele armyd clere, Many Troyan cam prikynge in þis nede, Þat maugre al þe my?t of Dyomede Þei Troilus han from his hondis take; And þo be-gan þe slau?ter for his sake On euery halfe, þat wonder is to telle, Of þe Troyans and þe Grekis felle. Þan in-to þe felde is entrid Menelay, Whiche on Troyens al þat ilke day Ful besy was avengid for to be, To hem he had so cruel enmyte; And whan Paris saw him in þe felde, Towardis hym þe ri?t[e] weye he helde, And of purpos þei her wardis sette Eche on oþer, til þei to-gidre mette: And þo [þe] skarmusche &amp; þe slau?ter gan, On ouþer part, of many manly man. And al þis while Hector nolde cese Amongis Grekis cruelly to prese, And new &amp; new, of hym as I rede, Iliche fresche þe blood of hem to schede: For of his swerde þe traces wern [y-]sene, Þat þe Grekis my?t[e] nat sustene To resiste nor stonde a-forn his face; But where he rood ay þei ?af him place, Til þat a kny?t, whiche Boetes hi?t, ?onge of age, whan he hadde a si?t How Hector slou? þe Grekis mortally, On euery side hauynge no mercy, He presed in to encrese his name, Perpetuelly to purchase hym a fame, And furiously, in herte nat a-ferde, He cast hym, platly, to mete him in þe berd. Þe whiche þing whan Hector gan aduerte, So hi?e rancour enbrasid hath his hert, Þat, with his swerde, of indignacioun He rofe hym euene to þe nouele doun— Fro þe crowne—wiþ so gret a peyne, Þat in þe feld he parted lay in tweyne: And Hector þo assigned haþ his stede To a squyer, &amp; bad he schuld it lede To Troye toun, with-oute more a-bood. And al þis while furiously he rood Amonge Grekis, and euer mercyles He slowe al þo þat putte hem silf in pres, And schad her blood, of hert[e] dispitous. Þe whiche þing whan kyng Archilagus, Rydynge be-side, sawe &amp; gan espie, How Boetes, his cosyn and allye, So cruelly was of Hector slawe, Towardis hym in hast he gan him drawe Vp-on his deth avengid for to be, And rood at hym with grete cruelte, Fully in purpos Hector for to quyte. And sodeynly, as he gan at hym smyte, Hector vnwarly hit hym on þe hed So my?tely, þat he fil doun ded, Partid on two by cruel auenture, Nat-with-stondynge his my?ti stronge armure— Ageyn his stroke it was of no diffence: For it was ?oue with swiche violence, Þat it halp hym in no maner þinge. And þan anoon, Prothenor þe kyng Of hatful Ire and foule hardynes, Of surquidie and of hastynes, Of malencolye and indignacioun Kau?t in his hert a presumpcioun Tassaillen Hector, of inward foly pride, And goth to hym, a-trauers on þe side, Furiously, with a dispitous herte, Þat his comynge he my?t nat aduerte— Only for he cam at his bak be-hynde, Al vnwarly, in Guydo as I fynde— And Hector smot from his hors to grounde, In whom þer was so moche manhod founde, Þat he anon, with a kny?tly herte, With-oute a-bood in-to his sadel sterte, And ri?t fersely Prothenor pursueth, Þat finally his hond he nat escheweþ: For with his swerd he marked him so wel Þoru? basenet, by his breste of stele, Þat in-to tweyn, with-outen any faile, He rofe him doun in-to his paunce of maile; And he fil doun, in ful pitous wyse, Of whiche stroke þe Grekis sore a-grise. And specialy þe hardy ferse Achille, Whan he behelde liked[e] ful ille— For Prothenor was his ny?e cosyn, And discendid of þe same lyne— For deth of whom he hath swiche heuynes, So inward þou?t, and so grete distres, In al þis worlde he nyste what to do— For hym he hadde so moche peyne &amp; wo. And for þe deth of Archilagus To ben avengid he was ful desirous, And in his herte many weye he caste, And in þe wardis gan to seke faste, With many Greke, on Hector to haue falle, Conspired fully, in soth, amonge hem alle, Of oon entent Hector to assaille; But al for nou?t,—it wolde nat availle— He was þat day so cruel in his rage, Þei my?t of hym haue non avauntage. And Troyan kny?tes by fauour of fortune Vp-on Grekis so my?tely contune, Þoru? conueiynge of Hector, &amp; his my?t, Þat þei anon han hem putte to fli?t, And to her tentis, maugre who þat strive, In her pursut for-woundid þei hem dryve, Þat here &amp; þere þei leien in a swou?; And many Greke mercyles þei slou? Þe longe day, til it drowe to ny?t. And sothly, þanne, for verray lak of li?t Þis Troyan kny?tes, ful worþi of renoun, Abouten Hector repeire to þe toun, And entren in with honour and with glorie, Þat day of Grekis havynge þe victorie: And þus I leue hem in her toun with-Inne, And forþe of Grekis telle I wil be-gynne. Howe Kynge Agamenon, with alle the princysse of Grece, compassyd and contryvede the dethe and destruccion of worthy Ector, the which Achilles vnmanly toke on honde. Whan Esperus, þe faire bri?t[e] sterre, Ageyn[e]s eve, caste his stremys ferre, And in þe weste raþest gan appere, Whan þe twyly?t, wiþ a pale chere, In maner morneth þe absence of þe sonne, And ny?t aprocheþ with his copis donne— Þe same tyme, whan Titan toke his leue, Þat clerkis calle Crepusculum at eve,— Whiche is nat ellis but þe mene li?t Of Phebus absence, and þe dirk[e] ny?t, And twyli?t hatte: for it is a mene Of day and ny?t, departinge hem betwene, Fully nouþer, but of boþe meynt, Or þe heuene be clustryd and depeynt With bri?t[e] sterris in þe Euenynge;— At whiche tyme Agamenoun þe kyng For his lordis sodeinly hath sent To come echon anon in-to his tent. And whan þei wern assemblid alle y-fere, Triste &amp; hevy, with a sorful chere, Þe[i] gan þe slau?ter of Hector to compleine, Affermynge playnly þei my?t neuer ateyne Vn-to victorie while he were a-lyue: Wherefore þei gan to conspire blive Þe deth of hym, in many sondry woye, Echon concludynge, while he wer in Troy It was nat likly Grekis for to wynne; For he alone of hem þat were with-Inne Was chef diffence and protectioun, And souereynly vp-holder of þe toun, Her my?ty castel and her strong[e] wal, And vn-to Grekis dedly fo mortal: For þei ne my?t his grete force endure, Nor neuer a-ri?t ageyn her foos be sure, He stondyng hool (þei seide), in no degre, Nor whil he floureth in felicite. Wherfor, echon, of oon entencioun, Þei-condiscende to þis conclusioun: Þat be som slei?t of a-wait lying, Whan he were most besy in fi?tynge, Amongis hem in meschef or distresse, Þat Achilles do his besynes, With al his my?t vnwarly him to assaille, Þat hym to slen for no þing þat he faille. And Grekis alle gan her prayer make To Achilles for to vndirtake Of þis emprise fynally þe swt, Þoru? his manhod þat it be execut— Þe hasty deth of her mortal foo. And Achilles, with-oute wordis moo, Her requeste assenteth to parforme, And to her lust gan holly hym conforme. Fro þat tyme late hym be war, I rede, To be to hasty þis Iourne for to spede, Vp-on Hector his power for to kythe, List Fortune a-wronge hir face wriþe, To loke on hym with a froward chere, Hym to bringe vn-to þe hondis nere, Þoru? sort or hap, of Hector, folily To put his lif of deth in iuparty, List vn-to hym it happe euene lyche To falle hym silfe in þe same dyche Þat he for Hector compassid haþ &amp; shape: For it is wonder ?if þat he eskape, Sith Hector hadde, with-outen any drede, As brennyng Ire and as grete hatrede To Achilles his deth for to purvey, ?if he hym founde or in place sey Convenient for execucioun— I trow þer schuld hym gayn[e] no raunsoun, Nor oþer mede his herte to quyete, But only deth, whan so þat þei mete: Þis þe ende &amp; fyn of þis mater, As in þis boke after ?e schal here. And þus Grekis maked han an ende Of her counseil, and anoon þei wende, Eueryche of hem, hom to her loggynge, And toke her reste til þe morw[e]nynge. Howe Ector, inly desyrous to have ado with the Grekis, entyrde the felde him selff, with C and fyffty thousande of þe best chosyn of the Cite of Troye; and the Grekys of þa same wies. Whan Aurora, with siluer dropes schene, Hir teris shadde vp-on þe freshe grene, Compleynynge ay in wepinge &amp; in sorwe Hir childis deth, euery somer morwe —Þis to seyne, whan þe dew so sote Enbawmed hath þe flour &amp; eke þe rote With lusty lycour, in April and in May, Whan þe larke, messanger of day, Of custom ay Aurora doth salue With sondry notis, hir sorwe to transmve Or Phebus ryse to Ioye and gladnes, Þoru? armonye to leue hir heuynes, Takyng hir leue, with seint[e] Iohn to borwe— Þe same tyme, Grekis by þe morwe, With lusty herte, erly dide a-ryse And armed hem in al her best[e] wyse: For þei hem caste þat day for to goon In-to þe felde to metyn with her foon. And Hector haþ, þe same morwe also, I-caste hym fully with Grekis haue a-do, And issed is kny?tly oute of Troye, In herte he hath so gret desire &amp; Ioye Þe same day with Grekis for to fi?t, And with hym ladde many lusty kny?t Of swiche as wern of þe cite born; And forþe he rood, hym silfe al to-forn, And Eneas with many a worþi Folwede after, wonder fast[e] by, And Paris þanne, and nexte hym Dephebus, And sith Troylus, þat was so cor[a]ious, With alle þe wardis made of Troye toun, In whiche, as Dares makeþ mencioun With-Inne his boke, þer wer on Troye syde Of fy?tyng men þat wente and dide ride An hundrid þousand, armyd for to go In-to þe felde, and fifty þousand mo Whiche han hem cast þat day or at Eue Of oon entent Grekis for to greue:— And so þei mette, stronge on ouþer side, And gan assemble and to-gedir ride Ful cruelly, and with gret hatrede. And with hem þo þat Paris dide lede, He entrid in ful my?ti stronge archeris Of Perce londe, &amp; many arblasteris, Þat with her arwes, filed scharp &amp; rounde, And with quarelles, square whet &amp; grounde, Ful many Greke han reued of his lyf. And [a-]myddes of þis mortal strif Agamenoun in-to þe felde is come, Towardis whom Hector haþ I-nome Þe ri?t[e] weye, &amp; þrewe him of his stede Amongis his kny?tes þat he dide lede— He spared nou?t, for al þe grete pres. And þer-with-al, anoon cam Achilles, Þat in await of Hector hadde leyn; And sodeinly, with al his my?t &amp; peyne, Hector he smote on þe hed [so] sore, Þat with þe stroke (myn auctor seiþ no more) His basenet was bowed and y-crasid,— Of whiche strok, Hector nat amasid, On Achilles schuld anoon y-falle, Nadde Eneas, with his kny?tes alle, And worþi Troylus come &amp; go by-twene— Þe whiche tweyne with her swerdis kene Gan Achilles felly for to assaille, To hewe his platis &amp; to perce his maille: And þo be-gan þe slau?ter on euery side Of men of fote &amp; of hem þat ride— Liche a condut her woundes gonne blede. And in þis while cruel Diomede, Were it be hap, auenture, or caas, So as he rood hath met with Eneas; And ri?t anoon, as he hath him founde, He smet at hym, and ?af him suche a wounde, Þat likly was he schulde nat recure, But ?if þer-to be do þe bettre cure. Howe Dyomede reprevyde Eneas as they met in the Felde, for þe answere þat he had afor in Troye. And þer-vppon, ful dispitously Þis Diomede in his malencolye Repreued hath þis Troyan kny?t Enee, And seide to hym: “al heil, for þou art he Þat whilom ?af to Priamus þi kyng A fel conseil, hasty and bityng, Me for to haue slaw be sodein violence Whan I was last at Troye in his presence, Þat trust me wel, &amp; haue it wel in mynde, Amyd þis feld if I þe efte fynde, Þou schalt þi conseil mortally repente, ?if þat Fortune her-after wil assent To bringe þe a-ri?t vn-to myn honde At good leyser, here in þin owne londe: I am ful sette þi labour for to quyte— And, here my trouþe, þis swerd schal kerue &amp; bite So kenely þi Troyan blood to schede, Þat finally deth shal be þi mede, Þe whiche I bere atwene myn hondis tweyne.” And with þat word, he my?t him nat restreyne, Þis Diomede, but rood al sodeinly Vp-on Enee, and so furiously He smote at hym, þis hardy cruel kny?t, With swyche a peyne &amp; so gret a my?t, Þat from his hors he made hym for to falle, Maugre þe my?t of his kny?tes alle:— Þe whiche stroke he lyked[e] ful ille. And in þis while, Hector hath Achille Assailled so, þat þoru? his basenet He perced hath, &amp; with his swerde hym smet, And so narowe brou?t hym to þe point Of hi?e meschef, &amp; in swyche disioynt Constreyned hym, þat of necessite He had hym take, nadde only be Sodeyn reskus of hym, chyualrous, Þat callid is þe sone of Tideus— I mene þe felle ferse Diomede, Whiche Achilles haþ holpen in þis nede: For he þoru? force of his armys tweyne Smot Hector tho, with so gret a peyne, Þat he hym ?af a wounde ful greuous; But he no þing (myn auctour writeþ þus) Astonyd was, þis kny?t, þis manly man, But with his swerde, in al þe hast he can, Smot Diomede so furious &amp; wroth, Þat from his hors to þe erþe he goth, For al his pride and his surquedie. Þe whiche anon, as Troylus dide espie, With-oute abood, doun of his stede ali?t With Diomede on fote for to fi?t, And eche of hem, in sothfastnes[se], þanne Aquyt hym silf lik a manly man, Þat nouþer was, in moche nor in lite, In no degre of manhod for to wite. And while þei fau?t, Hector &amp; Achilles To-gider mette ageyn a-monge þe pres, And ran I-fere fersely in her rage As wode lyons whan þei be ramage— Ri?t so, in soth, þei ferde in her fi?tyng. And in þat tyme Menelay þe kyng Ful proudly schope hym Troyens for to mete. Vlixes eke, and also Polimete, And aftir hym cam Neptalonius, Pallamydes, and eke Scelenivs, Duke Meneste, Nestor, and Thoas, Currunulus, and Philotheas, And Theseus, as [it] is made mynde, With his kny?tes proudly cam be-hynde. And on þe party of hem of þe toun Cam alle þe kynges, with-oute excepcioun, Þat were assemblid in-to her diffence, Ageyn[e]s Grekis to make resistence, —Excepte þe kny?tes whiche Hector ladde, And þe wardis þat he makid hadde Þe same day, as seith þe latyn boke, In kny?tly wyse þe feld whan þat he toke. And þo be-gan þe felle mortal fi?t, In whiche þat day ful many worþi kny?t In Fatis hondis, finally, are falle. And of fortune, a-monge þe wardis alle, Agamenoun, þe noble my?ty kyng, Al sodeinly as he cam ridyng, Pantisylaus in his weye mette, Ageyn[e]s whom anoon his hors he sette; And he to hym ful kny?tly rood ageyn, And as þei mette—þer is no more to seyn— On hors[e]-bak, whiles þei were wrothe, Of violence þei were vnhorsid bothe. And Menelay Parys mette of newe, Þe whiche two wel to-gidre knewe, Ful desyrous eche oþer for to dere; But Menelay cau?te firste a spere, And hitte Paris with al his inward cure, But for surnes of his strong armvre And my?ty platis, his wounde was but smal, Whiche, in effecte, greued nat at al: But with þat stroke vn-to þe grounde he goþe. Of whiche falle Paris wex ri?t wroþe, Wonder confus, &amp; also red for shame, List þe report, in hindringe of his name, Cam to þe eris of þe quene Eleyne, How he þat day my?t[e] nat attayne With Menelay to holden champartie, Lykly to sowne in-to his vileynye— Þe whiche at hert greuid hym ful sore. And Adrastus þe kyng, with-oute more, So as he rood, þe kyng Vlixes fond, And kny?tly boþe þei fou?ten hond of hond; And as þe[i] fau?t, doun to þe erþe lowe From his hors Vlixes haþ hym þrowe, And ful proudly, in signe of þis victorie, He sent his hors home to his tentorie. And in þat tyme, a-monges al þe pres, Ful sodeinly kyng Pallamydes Is falle on Hupon, with his lokkis hore, And in his Ire woundid hym so sore Þat he fil ded &amp; gruf vn-to þe grounde, His mortal swerd was so kene grounde:— Besyde whom Neptolonyus Assailled hath kyng Archilagus, Þe whiche hym silf manly gan diffende; But as þei fau?t, &amp; many strokes spende In her diffence—it wolde be noon oþer— Eueryche of hem hath vnhorsid oþer. And þo cam in, ridyng on his stede, Pollydamas, and gan to taken hede Amonge þe rengis litel hym be-side, Where as þe kyng Pallamydes doth ride; And cruelly, so lik a manly man, He smet his stede, and to hym he ran, And maugre his my?t &amp; his worþines —As þe story pleinly bereth witnes— Only to venge þe deth of kyng Hupoun, From his stede he proudly bar him doun, And in his rancour &amp; his cruel hete Of þat dispite gan hym to rehete. And þo be-side þe kyng Scelenus, Of dedly hate &amp; herte ful Irous, With kyng Carras be auenture hath mette, And furiously from his stede smet; And þanne also þe kyng Philemene Is on þe duke fallen of Athene, Þat maugre boþe his manhod &amp; his my?t, He hath his hors berafte him in þis fi?t, And lad with hym proudly by his side, Where as hym liste þat it schulde abyde. And Philotheas, þe worþi kyng also, Þe silfe tyme with Remus had a-do, And eueryche oþer, sothly, as I rede, His felawe hath made to voide his stede; And Theseus þe kyng, þat was so stronge, Amyd þe feld so as he rood a-monge Þe grete pres, hath mette Curyalus, Þe worþi kyng, of kny?thod ri?t famus, And boþe two, in armys wonder stronge, By hem silf fau?t at leiser longe, Til eche oþer, with woundes fresche &amp; grene, His felawe þrewe endelonge þe grene; And afterwarde, I finde, how þei two Vp-on fote kny?tly hadde a-do— Þei wern in armys so inly desyrous, And of manhood passyngly famous. And al þis whyle þe sonys naturel Of Priamus bar hem wonder wel, Amonge Grekis vp and doun ridyng, And prudently to-gidre abidyng, Made [a] slau?ter of Grekis ful pitous, Of kynges, dukes, &amp; lordis ri?t famous. And, as I rede, how worþi Thelamoun Þat tyme mette with kyng Sarpedoun; And with her speres, squared ful sharply, Euerych haþ oþer wounded mortally Þoru? schilde &amp; plate &amp; haberioun of maille, Þat, as þe story makeþ rehersaille, How her harneis wex of blod al red, And how þei fil al-most boþe ded, At gret meschef amonge þe horse fet, Of whos bledyng þe soiel gan wexe wet, Þoru? her harneis as it gan distille. Whiles kyng Thoas and þe ferse Achille, As þei þat wern of kyn and allyed, Amyd þe feld Hector han espied Where as he fau?t, be-set amyd his foon; And vp-on hym of on accorde þei goon, And mortally, ?if it wolde availle, On euery halfe þei gan hym new assaille, And of hate, in herte born of ?ore, Þei han be-set þis Troyan kny?t [so] sore, Þat þei, allas! from his hed han smet By violence his riche basenet, And wounded hym felly on þe hed: But for al þat, he ne toke noon hed, Þis worþi man, flour of chiualrye, But hym diffendynge þo so my?tely, Kyng Thoas smot in þe face so, Þat with a stroke he rofe his nose a-two, And shortid it by þe haluendel. At whiche stroke, þe breþer naturel Of manly Hector fast[e] gan hem hy?e To socour hym, whan þei first espie His grete meschef; and at her in commyng Þei so manly bare hem in fi?tynge Ageyn Grekis, þat Thoas þei han take; And Thelamoun so þei made a-wake, With new assaut of sharpe woundis kene, Þat he was take &amp; left vp-on þe grene, And of his men born home to his tent. And kyng Thoas home to Troye is went, Maugre Grekis, whiche helpe him may no more; For Dephebus and also Anthenor Han sent hym forþ to Troye þe cite. And Menelay þo be-gan to se, So as he rood, Paris stonde a-side, And shope him shortly of hate &amp; cruel pride, ?if it wolde fallen on his chaunce, Sodeinly to ?euen hym meschaunce; But he was war, &amp; kepte him silf so narwe Þat Menelay he marked with an arwe, Þe hed of whiche with venym was enoint, Intoxicat at þe square pointe, Þat þe kyng, of þat dredful wounde Al dispeired of his men was founde, Whiche in gret haste bar hym to his tent. And he anoon for surgiens haþ sent, Whiche first þe hede toke out of his wounde —Al-be it was [y-]percid ful profounde Þoru? his harneis ful depe in-to þe bon— But konnyngly þei dide her craft echon To drawe it oute with her instrumentis, And sotilly, with serteyn oynementis Þei cerched han þe wounde enviroun To make it clene fro[m] corrupcioun; And prudently firste þei token hede, Þat þe venym ferþer nat procede, Rounde in compas clensid it a-boute, And after þat, bonde it sure with-oute, And defensives made on euery syde. And Menelay no lenger wolde bide, But bad in haste bringe forþe his stede, In purpos ful Paris to quite his mede, ?if he hym finde, þe silfe same day— Hym list no lenger put it in delay, What-euere falle of his grene wounde. And forþe he rood til he haþ him founde, By auenture vn-armyd in þe felde, With-oute swerde, polex, spere, or shelde, Or bowe in hond—were it of reclisnes, Or to refresche hym after werynes. And Menelay anoon a spere haþ take, And in his Ire felly gan it shake Toward Paris, by gret avisenes, And schuld haue slawe him, as bi liklines, Nadde Eneas, whiche al þis þing behilde, Born of þe stroke with his strong[e] schelde, To diffende hym in [t]his auenture— Destitute and naked of armvre, Paris þat tyme in swiche peril was. Wherfore, in hast, hath þis Eneas Ordeyned kny?tes, armyd bri?t in stele, Aboute Paris for to kepe hym wele From al meschef and confusioun, Hym to conveie vn-to Troye toun, Ri?t in dispite of kyng Menelay, Whiche in a-wait so for Paris lay— Whom Hector had I-take sodeinly, And vn-to Troye ladde hym outterly, Nadde Grekis come in his diffence, Ageyn[e]s hym to make resistence. Of whiche Hector, as þei cam in his weye, Ful many Greke made for to deie, And þe remenaunt put vn-to þe fli?t, Þat þoru? his manhod þat day, &amp; his my?t, Troyens made þe Grekis for to fle Vn-to her tentis, of necessite, And hem to sue nolde neuere leue, But slen &amp; kille til it drowe to eve, Þat Phebus gan fast[e] for to weste, To draw hem hom þei þou?t[e] for þe beste: For Titan was at his goynge doun Whan þei gan entre in-to Troye toun,— Her gatis schette, þei to her loggyng wende; And of þis day þus þei made an ende. Howe kynge Pryamus the next day kam to þe felde, &amp; howe he wolde have had kynge Thoas dede, þat was prysonere in Troye. Til on þe morwe, þat þe rowes rede Of Phebus carte gonne for to sprede A-forn his vp-riste in the orient, At whiche tyme, kyng Priamus haþe sent For swiche as werne with him moste preve, And of his counseille inwardly secre; And specialy he sent[e] for be name, For worþi Hector, þat grettest was of fame, For Paris eke, &amp; for Dephebus, And for Troylus, freshe and desirous, For Anthenor and [for] Pollydamas, And for the Troyan called Eneas: For he þat day cast him nat to goon In-to þe felde to mete with his foon. And whan þei wern to his paleis come, Þis lordis han þe ri?t[e] weye nome Vn-to þe kyng, with-Inne his closet; And whan þe hussher haþ þe dore shet, And eueryche hadde, liche to his degre, His place take, and his dewe see, Þis worþi kyng, as made is mencioun, Gan to declare his hertis mocioun, And his menynge a-forn hem specifie, And seide: “sirs, in whom I moste affie, To ?ow is knowe how kyng Thoas is here In þis cite taken prisoner, And is as ?et be-loken in prisoun, Whiche euere haþ be vn-to Troye toun An enmy gret, vn-to his power, And vs offendid, boþe fer and nere, In many wyse (al-be we litel reche) As fer as he his force my?t[e] streche; And now with Grekis cam to sege our toun, As he þat wilneth oure distruccioun, And [t]here-vppon hath done his besynes: Wherfore, of doom &amp; of ri?twysnes, Boþe of resoun and of equyte, I seie pleynly, as semeth vn-to me, So þat it be to ?ow acceptable, And þat ?e þink my counseil comendable, Liche as he hath cast oure deth &amp; shape, I holde ri?tful þat he nat eskape, But þat of deth he resseyue his guerdoun: For ri?t requereth, and also good resoun, Þat deth for deth is skilful guerdonynge, Vn-to my wit, and ri?t wel sittynge— Seth ?our avis [now] pleinly in þis cas.” And first of alle þo spake Eneas, And seide: “lord, so it be noon offence To ?oure hi?nes to ?eue me audience, Þoru? supporte here of hem þat be ful wys, I shal reherse pleynly my devys, What is to werken [as] in þis matere: Me semeth first, my lege lorde so dere, Þat ?oure noble, royal excellence Consydre shulde, with ful hi?e prudence, In euery werke and operacioun To caste a-forn, in conclusioun, Þe final ende þat may after swe; For to a wysman, only is nat dewe To se þe gynnynge and þe ende no?t, But boþe attonis peisen in his þou?t, And weien hem so iustly in balaunce Þat of þe fyn folwe no repentaunce. Whi I seie þis, &amp;, platly, whi I mene, Is [for] þat ?e ou?ten for to sene How kyng Thoas is oon þe principal Amonge Grekis, &amp; of þe blood royal— ?if ?e considre, descendid as be lyn: Wherfore, ?if he haue þus foule a fyn, To be slawe while he is in presoun, It my?t happen, in conclusioun, Þat ?e and ?ours, þat þer-to assente, Here-afterwarde sore to repente: I preue it þus, þat ?if by auenture, Or fortune, þat no man may assure, Some of ?oure lordis were a-noþer day Of Grekis take, as it happe may, Or of ?oure sonys, so worþi of renoun, Or of kynges þat ben in þis toun,— Trusteþ me wel, þat swiche gentilnes As ?e schew to hem in her distres, Þei wil ?ou quyte whan, in cas semblable, Fortune to hem þei finde fauerable, Þe whiche no man constreyne may nor binde. Wherfore, my lorde, haue þis þing in mynde: For ?if Thoas, of short avisement, Shal nowe be ded þoru? hasty Iugement, A-noþer day Grekis wil vs quyte, And of rigour make her malis byte On some of ?ouris, who-euere þat it be, And nouþer spare hi?e nor lowe degre, Þou? he were paraunter of ?oure blood; Þe whiche þing, for al þis worldis good It my?t[e] falle, þat ?e nolde se. Wherfore I rede, lete kyng Thoas be Honestly keped in prisoun, Lyche his estate, stille here in þis toun, List, as I seide, þat anoþer day Somme lorde of ?ouris, as it happe may, Casuelly were take of auenture: Be eschaunge of hym ?e my?t[e] best recure, With-oute strif, ?oure owne man ageyn. In þis mater I can no more seyn, But finally þis is my ful[le] rede.” To whiche counseil Hector toke good hede, And for it was accordynge to resoun, He hit commendith in his oppinoun. But Priam, euere of oo entencioun, Stode alweie fix to þis conclusioun, Pleinly affermynge: “?if Grekis may espie Þat we þis kyng spare of gent[e]rye, Þei wil arrette it cowardyse anoon, Þat we dar nat venge vs on oure foon, For verray drede havyng noon hardines, Nor herte nouþer to do ri?twisnes; ?et, neuerþeles, after ?oure assent, Þat he shal leue, I wele in myn entent To ?oure desire fully condescende.” And of þis counseil so þei made an ende, With-oute more, saue Eneas is go, And Troylus eke, and Anthenor also, In-to an halle, excellynge of bewte, Þe quene Eleyne of purpos for to se, With whom was eke Eccuba þe quene, And oþer ladyes goodly on to sene, And many mayde þat ?onge &amp; lusti was. And worþi Troilus with þis Eneas Dide her labour and her besy peyne For to counforte þe faire quene Eleyne, As sche þat stood for þe werre in drede; But for all þat, of verray wommanhede, Þilk[e] tyme, with al hir herte entere, As she wel koude, maked hem good chere, Havynge of konnynge inly suffisaunce Boþe of chere and of dalyaunce. And Eccuba, beyng in þis halle, Verray exaumple vn-to wommen alle, Of bounte havynge souereyn excellence, In wisdam eke, and in elloquence, Besou?te hem þo, wonder wommanly, And counsaillede eke ful prudently, For any haste, boþe ny?e and ferre, Avisely to kepe hem in þe werre, And nat iuparte her bodies folily; But to aduerte and caste prudently In diffence kny?tly of þe toun, Hem to gouerne by discrecioun:— She spake of feith, &amp; koude no þinge feyne. And þanne of hir, &amp; after of Eleyne Þei toke leue, and no lenger dwelle, But went her wey. &amp; forþe I wil ?ou telle How þe Grekis on þe same morwe Amonge hem silfe compleyne &amp; make sorwe, Her harmys grete, in murmur &amp; in rage, Þe losse, þe costis, and þe grete damage Þat þei han endured folily, Lastynge þe werre, &amp; wiste neuer why— Þe deth, þe slau?ter of many worþi man Siþen tyme þat þe werre be-gan, Hunger &amp; þurste, wacche &amp; colde also, Ful gret vnreste, sorwe, þou?t, &amp; wo— And al to-gidre for a þing of nou?t, In sothfastnes, ?if þe grounde be sou?t: Þis was þe noyse &amp; rumur eke þat ran Þoru?-oute þe hoste þat day fro man to man, And moste a-monge þe pore sodyours, Whiche bere þe bront euere of suche shoures, And þe meschef of werre, comounly; And þou? þei pleyne, þei haue no remedie Of þinges whiche sitten hem ful vnsofte. Of the orryble and hydouse tempest, thondre, levene that roos sodeynly vpon the Grekys. And þus Grekis compleyned han ful ofte Of many meschef þat haþ on hem falle, Þe whiche þei my?t han eschewed alle, ?if þei ne had of foly gonne a werre, Oute of Grece nat comen halfe so ferre, To her meschef and confusioun: Þis was þat day her lamentacioun, Whiche to encrese, þe same nexte ny?t So dirked was, with-oute sterre li?t, So cloudy blak, and so þikke of eyr, Dymmed with skies foule &amp; no þing fair, So wyndy eke, with tempest al be-leyn, Almoste for-drenchid with þe smoky reyn, And in þe felde astonyed here &amp; ?onder With sodeyn stroke of þe dredful þonder, And with openyng of þe hydous levene, Þat it sempte in þe hi?e hevene Þe cataractis hadde bene vn-do; For þe cloudis and skyes, boþe two, Sodeynly wexen were so blake, Liche as þe goddis wolde haue take wrak, And had of newe assentid ben in oon Þe londe to drenche of Deucalyon, And al þis world, with-oute more refuge, To ouerflowe with a fresche deluge. The Grekys tentys and pavelones, with stroke of thundure sodeynly wer cast oute of þe felde. Þe wynde also so sternely gan blowe, Þat her tentis, stondyng on a rowe, Forpossid werne, and y-bete doun; And furiously, to here confusioun, Þe flodis rau?t hem from her stondynge place, And bare hem forþe a ful large space, Wher-of in meschef and in gret distresse, In gret labour &amp; hertly hevynes Þe Grekis biden al þe same ny?t, What for þe tempest &amp; for lak of li?t,— Til þe flood gan ageyn withdrawe, Þe wynde tapese, and þe day gan dawe, And þe heuene gan ageyn to clere, With-oute cloudis, &amp; freschely to appere; And Phebus eke with a feruent hete Hadde on þe soille dried vp þe wete And þe moysture enviroun on þe pleyn. And Grekis had her tentis set ageyn, And wern a-dawed of her ny?tes sorwe Þoru? þaperyng of þe glade morwe: Þei hem array, no þing for þe pes, And in-to þe felde first went Achilles, As ?e shal here, of entencioun Þat day to fi?te with hem of Troye toun. Howe kynge Hupon, of stature lich a geante, was sclayn of his Enn[em]y Achilles; for whoos dethe, worthy Ector that day, with his swerde wrough[t] maryeylis, and kylde mony kynges. Whanne dried was þe lusty large pleyn With Phebus bemys, as ?e han herd me seyn, Þe Troyan kny?tes, ful worþi of renoun, Descendid ben and y-come doun, And in þe feld toke her fi?tynge place; But Achilles, to mete hem in þe face, To-forne went oute, lik as I ?ou tolde, With his lordis &amp; his kny?tes bolde. And firste, I finde, with-oute more abood, Vn-to Hupoun furiously he rood (I mene Hupoun þat was of his stature Lik a geante, as bookis vs assure), Whom Achilles with his scharp[e] spere Þoru? þe body percid hym so fere Þat he fil ded, his wounde was so kene. And after þis, þe kyng Octamene, As he fersely on Hector wolde haue gon, With-oute a-bood Hector hym slowe anon, And cruelly quitte hym his fatal mede. And sodeynly ageyn[e]s Dyomede, As ?antipus, þe worþi kyng, gan drawe, Ful pitously he of hym was slawe. And ri?t anon þe kyng Epistrophus [And ek þe kyng þat hi?te Cedius Of oon assent, proudly in bataille, Begonnen Hector mortally tassayle; And wiþ a spere first Epistrophus] Ran at hym, with herte dispitous, And, as Guydo also doth deuyse, Rebuked hym in vngoodly wyse— To hym so sore in herte he was amevid. Where-of Hector, furiously a-grevid, Haþ mortally his wounde made so large, Þat hym ne geyneþ plate, shelde, nor targe; For he fil ded amonge his men echon, To whom Hector bad he shulde goon To þe furies, depe doun in helle, Swiche wordis amongis hem to telle:— “For here,” quod he, “men take of hem noon hede.” And þus whan he was wagid for his mede, Anon his broþer, callid Cedius, Swiche sorwe made for Epistrophus, So hertly dool, and so woful chere, Þat pite was for to sen and here, So inwardly on his deth he þou?t: And with a þousand kny?tes þat he brou?t, To ben avengid by manhod of hem alle, Dispitously on Hector he is falle, Wher he hym fonde fi?tinge with his foon, Þat þoru? þe force of hem euerychon, So sore enviroun þei han hym be-set, Þat from his stede doun þei han hym smet; Whom Cedius, ay in his cruel rage, Whan þat he sawe to his avauntage Hector vnhorsid, and he on his stede, His swerd he lifte of inward[ly] hatrede, Markynge at hym with so gret a peyne, With al þe force of his armys tweyne, Fully in purpos, with-oute more delay, To slen Hector, pleynly, ?if he may. But or his stroke descende my?t[e] doun, Hector, of hate and indignacioun, With his swerde, þat was ful sharp[e] whet, From his sholdre haþ his arme of smet; And after þat, he reued hym his lyf. Þanne Eneas amyddes al þis strif Cam ridynge in, wood and furious; And as he mette þe kyng Amphymacus, He fel on hym &amp; slow hym in his rage. And from Grekis holdyng her passage, Þer cam doun, frist Menelaus, And after hym kyng Thelamonyvs, Þe grete duke also of Athene, In whom þer was so moche manhod sene, Vlixes eke, and cruel Dyomede, And eke also, to helpe hem in her nede, Þer cam with hem þe kyng Machaoun, And alderlaste þe grete Agamenoun, With alle her wardis, &amp; fel in sodeynly Vp-on Troyens; &amp; þei ful manfully Defende hem silf ageyn þe Grekis proude, And put hem of ful kny?tly, as þei koude: And eche on oþer, sothly, as þei mette, With spere &amp; swerde enviously þei sette— So mortal hate þer was hem betwene. And whan þe sonne was in Meridene, In mydday angel, passynge hote &amp; shene, Þe Grekis gonne felly in her tene So my?tely to falle on hem of Troye, Þat þei hem made for to ?eue woye, Of verray force and necessite. And Achilles, so ful of cruelte, Amonge þe rengis as he gan him drawe, Þe kyng Philem enviously haþ slawe; And myd of Grekis þe same tyme Hector, Maugre hem alle, slowe kyng Alphenor, And eke þe kyng callid Dorovs: On hem he was so cruel and Irous, Þat, þoru? vertu of his kny?tly hond, Troyens han wonne a-geyn her londe Vp-on Grekis, and made hem for to fle. Of the monstrouvse Archere that was half man half hors, and was with kynge Epistrophus. And þilke hour, from Troye þe cite, Epistrofus, ful of manlynes, Þe felde haþ take þoru? his worþines; And on Grekis proudly, for þe nonys, With his kny?tes [he] falleþ al attonys, And seuered hem &amp; made hem for to twynne, And gan þe felde faste vp-on hem wynne, Havynge þat tyme in his companye, Amongis oþer þat he dide guye, A certeyn archer, þe whiche, as I fynde, Was monstruous &amp; wonderful of kynde: For from þe myddel vp vn-to þe crowne He was a man; &amp; þe remenaunte doune Bar of an hors liknes and figure; And horsis her, þis monstre in nature Hadde on his skyn growyng enviroun, Ful rowe &amp; þikke; &amp; of his vois þe soun Was liche þe neiynge of an hors, I rede; And þou? his face, boþe in lengþe &amp; brede, Of shap were mannyshe, ?et, in sothfa[s]tnes, His colour was semblable in liknes Vn-to þe fery, hote, brennynge glede, Whos eyen eke, flawmynge also rede As þe blase of an oven mouthe— And for he was in si?te so vnkouthe, Wher-so-euere he was mette in þe berde, Boþe man &amp; hors sore werne a-ferde, His face was so hatful and odyble, And his loke so hydous and orible. And ay he had in custom &amp; vsaunce, As in bokis is made remembraunce, For to goon vn-armyd in-to þe felde, With-oute swerde, spere, axe, or shelde; For he no þing koude of þat myster: But, as I finde, he was a good archer, And bare a bowe, stif &amp; wonder stronge; And for he was also of tiler longe, His arwes wern liche to his tiler,— In a quyuer trussed wonder ner By his side, ay redy to his honde, Where-so he were, ouþer on se or londe. And, as I finde, how þat noon armvre Ageyn his schot pleinly my?t endure; And þer nas hors, stede, nor courser Þat durste abide, nouþer fer nor nere, But fled anoon with al her ful my?t As faste as þei of hym had a si?t, To hem he was so passyng odyous, So like a deuele, and so monstruous: And þer was founde noon so hardi kny?t On hors[e]-bak þat had[de] force or my?t To holde his hors whan þei my?t hym se, But þat anoon abak he wolde fle. And of þis archer I finde writen eke, Þat he þat day slowe [ful] many Greke, And wounded hem with his arwes kene Þoru?-oute þe platis, forgid bri?t &amp; shene; For þer was non a-forn hym þat abood, But to her tentis fast awey þei rood, Þei my?t[e] nat his hidous loke endure. Howe Dyomede slewe the Sagittarye bysydes his tent, with a darte intoxicayte with venyme. Til þer be-fil a wonder auenture: While þei of Troye by help of þis archer Sewe on þe chaas to her loggynge ner, And slowe of hem, in meschef &amp; in drede, Be-syde a tent met[te] Dyomede With þis archer, of necessite; For it stood so, þat he ne my?t hym fle No maner weye, nor a-bak remwe— For lyf nor deth, he my?t him nat eschwe, So many Troyan was þo at his bake, In his fleyng he had go to wrak: Wherfor, anon, þis hardy Dyomede, With cruel herte fast[e] gan hym spede, And toward hym proudly for to dresse. But þis archer, by gret avysenes, First with an arwe smet[te] Dyomede Þoru? his harneis, þat he made him blede, Of whiche stroke he wexe so wood &amp; wroþe, Þat to þis monstre, so hidous &amp; so loþe, He went a pas, &amp; hym vn-armyd fond; And with þe swerde þat he hilde in his hond, He ?af to hym his last[e] fatal wounde, Þat he fil ded,—gruf vn-to [þe] grounde. Þe deth of whom Grekis reioisshinge, And, in al haste, her hertis resumynge, Be-gan hem silf for to recounforte; And in-to þe felde proudly þei resorte By conveiynge of Polixenar, Þe worþi duke, þat so wel him bar Vp-on Troyens þat day in þe felde. But whan Hector þe slau?ter of him behilde, Vp-on þis duke anon he gan to sette; And on her stedis fersly as þei mette, Hector hym slou?e, of ful grete hatrede. And after þat, on Galathe his stede, So as he rood forþe amonge þe þres, Or he was war he meteth Achilles; And with her speris, longe, large, &amp; rounde, In purpos fully eche oþer to confounde, Þei ran I-fere, Irous &amp; ri?t wrothe, Þat with þe stroke þe[i] wer vnhorsid boþe: But Achilles, with a dispitous herte, First, as I rede, in-to his sadel sterte, And besy was, with al his inward peyne, Gallathe to taken by þe reyne, Þer-of for euere Hector to deprive, And bad his men to lede it hom as bliue, So þat Hector—þer was noon oþer bote— Ful like a man fau?t stondyng on fote Amonge Grekis and his fomen alle; And to his kny?tes loude he gan to calle, For his stede þat þei shulde swe; And þei in haste his hors to reskewe, Bene attonys fallen on Achille, And maugre hym, of force, ageyn his wille, Þei han from him berafte it on þe pleyn, And to Hector restorid it ageyn, Whiche in kny?thod so moche him-silf assureth, Dispit of hem his sadel he recureth, Whiche afterwarde ful dere þei abou?t. For liche a lyoun al þat day he wrou?t, Amonge[s] hem ridynge here &amp; þere, And as þe deth þei fled his swerd for fere, Þoru? whos manhod Troyens efte be-gynne Vp-on Grekis þe felde ageyn to wynne. But it be-fil amyd her grete fi?t, Þat Anthenor, a certyn Troyan kny?t, Amonge þe pres is so fer in goon, Þat of Grekis he was take a-non, And to her tentis sent in haste he was; Al-be his sone, callid Pollydamas, To reskewe hym dide his dilligence So manfully, þat no necligence Was founde in hym, who-so liste to seke; And þat ful dere abou?t[e] many Greke, Þe same day, þoru? his worþines: But for cause only of dirknes, And for þat it gan drawe towarde ny?t, Þei made an ende only for lake of li?t. [And Grekis wente hom to her loggyng,] And eke Troyens; til on þe morw[e]nynge, Þat Phebus gan his bri?t[e] bemys shewe, And Aurora newe gan a-dewe Þe herbis sote and þe grene levis, Bothe in haies and in freshe greuys, Siluer bri?t, with rounde perlys fyne, Þat so clerly ageyn þe sonne shyne, And shewe hem silf, so orient &amp; shene, On hil &amp; vale, and on euery grene, Þe rody morwe, til þe hote bemys Of bri?t[e] Phebus with his firy stremys Vapoureth vp her moysture in-to þe eyr, Þe wedir clere, agreable, and feir, And attempre also of his hete, Whan þe Troyens [cast] hem for to mete With her fomen, platly, ?if þei may. And oute þei wente in her beste array, With her wardis in-to feld by rowe, Ageyn[e]s whom Grekis wer nat slowe, But shope hem forþe, with-oute lenger let, Til þei to-gidir manfully han met; And with her speris &amp; her swerdis clere, Þei ran to-gedir, with a dispitous chere, Til shyuerid was a-sondre many spere On shildis stronge, hem siluen for to were, And ryuen was on pecis many targe; And, with exis, rounde, brode, and large, On basenettis as þei smyte and shrede, Ful many kny?t mortally gan blede, In sothfastnes; and, as I telle can, Þe same day was slayn many [a] man On ouþer part, but most of Troye toun, Al-be Guydo maketh no mencioun Of no persone, as in special, On nouþer syde, but in general— Saue he concludiþ, pleynly, þat þis fi?t Laste fro morwe til þat it was ny?t, Þe whiche Troyans han ful dere a-bou?t: For þilk[e] day fortune halp hem nou?t, But turned hool to her confusioun, And so þei bene repeired to þe toun. Howe the Grekes sent Dyomede and Vlixes to kynge Pryamus for a trewes of thre monethes. And to her tentis Grekis faste hem spede, Til on þe morwe þei sent Dyomede With Vlixes to Troye þe cite For a trewe, only for monyþes þre, ?if kyng Priam þer-to wolde assent. And as þei two on þis message went, A certeyn kny?t, born of Troye toun, Þat hi?t Dolon, of grete discrecioun, And was also ri?t famous of riches, Of curtesye, and of gentilnes, His deuer dide, and his dilligence Hem to conueye vn-to þe presence Of Priamus in his paleis royal; And in his se, most chefe and principal, Where as he sat, his lordis enviroun, With many kny?t ful worþi of renoun, Þei gan to hym first to specefie Holy þe substaunce of her embassatrie, And of þe trewe þer entent þei tolde, ?if it so were he assenten wolde. Howe Kynge Priamus graunt to the Grekis ther askynge; bot worthi Ector was ther-to contrarye. And þe kyng benygnely hem herde, And by avys prudently answerde, Þat þer-vppon, his honour for to saue, At good leiser he wold a counseil haue With his lordis, and fully hym gouerne In þis mater like as þei discerne; And, to conclude shortly, euerychon Assentid ben, excepte Hector allone, Vn-to þe trewe, &amp; nolde it nat denye: But Hector seide, þat of trecherie, Only of slei?t and of false tresoun Her axynge was, vnder occasioun, First to burie Grekis þat wer dede, And vnder colour þer-of—oute of drede— Afterwarde hem siluen to vitaille; For he wel knewe þat her stuf gan faille, And enfamyned, liste þei shulde dye, Þei sou?te a space hem siluen to purueye, By outewarde signes þat he dide espie. “Wherfore,” quod he, “me lykeþ nat to lye, By apparence, as I dar preswme, Whyles þat we wasten &amp; conswme Oure stuf with-Inne, as it is to drede, Þei wil prouide of w[h]at þat þei [haue] nede; For al þat is to hem a-vauntage, Mut ben to vs hynderynge &amp; damage; And whiles þei encres[en] and amende, We shal oure store discresen and dispende: ?it neuerþeles, how-euere þat it be, Towchyng þis trew as for monþes þre, Sethen ?e alle assenten and accorde, Fro ?oure sentence I wil nat discorde, In no wyse to be variaunt.” And þus þe trewe confermed was be graunt, On ouþer syde hem þou?t[e] for þe beste, By-cause þei shulde in quiete &amp; in reste Þe mene while ese hem and releue; And þei þat felte her woundis sore greue Mi?t haue leiser hem silfe to recure. Howe durenge the trewes Anthenore was delywerde fro þe Grekis, for kynge Thoas and Cresseyde. And while þe trewe dide þus endure, Þei fil in trete and in comwnynge Of Anthenor and [of] Thoas þe kyng: Þat Anthenor shulde delyuered be For kyng Thoas, to Troye þe cite; And Thoas shulde to Grekis home ageyn, Only be eschaunge, as ?e han herde me seyn, Oon for a-noþer, as it accorded was. And in þis while þe byshope, he, Calchas, Remembrid hym on his dou?ter dere, Callid Cryseide, with hir eyen clere, Whom in Troye he had lefte be-hynde Whanne he wente, as þe boke makiþ mynde: For whom he felte passingly gret smert, So tendirly she was set at his herte, And enprentid, boþe at eue and morwe. And chefe cause &amp; grounde of al his sorwe Was þat she lefte behynde [hym] in þe toun With-oute comforte or consolacioun, As he caste, sothly, in his absence, And specially for his grete offence Þat he haþ wrou?t a?ens hem of Troye; And, as hym þou?t, he neuer shulde han Ioye Til he his dou?ter recurid hath ageyn. Wherfore Calchas, þe story seith certeyn, In his wittes many weies caste Howe he my?t, while þe trew doþ laste, Recure his dou?ter by som maner way; And, as I fynde, vp-on a certeyn day, In his porte wonder humblely, With wepynge eye, wente pitously, In compleynynge, of teris al be-reyned, Whos inwarde wo, soþly, was nat feined, And on his knees anoon he falleþ doun To-fore þe grete kyng Agamenoun, Besechynge hym, with al humilite, Of verray mercy &amp; of hi?e pite, With oþer kynges sittinge in þe place, To haue routhe, &amp; for to don hym grace, And on his wo to haue compassioun, Þat he may haue restitucioun Of his dou?ter whom he loued so,— Preyinge hem alle her deuer for to do, Þat þoru? her prudent medyacioun, For Antenor, þat was in her prisoun, With kyng Thoas she my?t eschaunged be, ?if þat hem liste of her benignyte To his requeste goodly to assente. And þei him graunte; &amp; forþe anoon þei sente To kyng Priam for to haue Cryseide For Calchas sake, &amp; þer-with-al þei leide Þe charge for hir wonder specially On hem þat wente for þis enbassatrie To Troye toun and to kyng Priamus,— To whom Calchas was so odyous, So hateful eke, þoru?-oute al þe toun, Þat þis reporte was of him vp and doun: Þat he a traytour was, &amp; also false, Worþi to ben enhonged be þe halse For his tresoun and his doublenes. And, ouermore, þei seiden eke expresse, Þat he disserued haþ, be ri?t of lawe, Shamfully firste for to be drawe, And afterward, þe most orrible deth Þat he may haue, to ?elden vp þe breth Liche a treytour in a[s] dispitous wyse As any herte can þenke or deuyse— Eueryche affermynge, as by Iugement, Þat deth was noon ffully equipolent To his deserte, nor to his falsenes, As ?onge &amp; olde pleinly bar witnes; Concludynge eke, for his iniquite, Þat þei wolde assent in no degre Vn-to no þinge þat my?t his hert[e] plese, Nor of Cryseide, for to don hym ese, Þei caste nat to make delyueraunce— Leuer þei hadden to ?eue hym meschaunce, ?if þei hym my?t haue at good[e] large. But finally þeffecte of al þis charge Is so ferforþe dryuen to an ende, Þat Priamus hath graunted sche shal wende With kyng Thoas, shortly, þer is no more, Vn-to hir fader for daun? Anthenor— Who-euere gruche, þe kyng in parlament Hath þer-vppon ?oue iugement So outterly, it may nat be repeled: For, with his worde þe sentence was asselid, Þat she mot parte, with hir eyen glade. And of þe sorwe, pleinly, þat she made At hir departynge, her-aftir ?e shal here Whan it ageyn cometh to my matere. Howe worthy Ector, durenge the trewes, kame to the Tent of Achilles, where they were condescendyde that the quarells, as wele of the Troiayns parte as of þe Grekes, shulde be deraynede by the handys of theme two, yif þe Troians and Grekis wolde ther-to consente. The trew affermyd, as ?e han herd deuise, On ouþer side, of hem þat wer ful wyse, And ful assentid of hem euerychon, Til þre monþes come be and goon, Liche as I rede, on a certeyn day, Whan agreable was þe morwe gray, Blaundiss[h]inge and plesant of delit, Hector in herte cau?te an appetite (Like as Guydo liketh for to write) Þe same day Grekis to vesite, Ful wel be-seyn, and wounder richely, With many worþi in his company, Of swiche as he for þe nonys ches. And to þe tent first of Achilles, I fynde, in soth, þis worþi Troyan kny?t Vp-on his stede toke þe weie ri?t, Ful liche a man, as made is mencioun. Now hadde Achilles gret affeccioun In his herte, boþe day and ny?t, Of worþi Hector for to han a si?t: For neuer his lyue, by non occasioun He my?t of hym han non inspeccioun, Nor hym be-holde at good liberte; For vnarmyd he my?t him neuer se. But wonder kny?tly, boþe in port &amp; chere, Þei had hem boþe as þei mette in fere, And ri?t manly in her countenaunce; And at the laste þei fille in dalyaunce. But Achilles firste began abreide, And vn-to hym euene þus he seide: “Hector,” quod he, “ful plesyng is to me Þat I at leiser nakid may þe se, Sith I of þe neuere my?t haue si?t But w[h]an þou were armyd as a kny?t; And now to me it schal be ful greuous, Whiche am to þe so inly envious, But þou of me—þer is no more to seyne— Be slaie anon with myn hondis tweyne: For þis, in soth, wer hoolly my plesaunce, By cruel deth to take on þe vengaunce; For I ful ofte, in werre &amp; eke in fi?t, Haue felt þe vertu &amp; þe grete my?t Of þi force, þoru? many woundis kene, Þat vp-on me be ful fresche &amp; grene In many place, be shedynge of my blood— Þou were on me so furious and wood, Ay compassynge to my distruccioun; For many a mail of myn haberion Þi sharpe swerd racid haþe a-sonder, And cruelly seuered here and ?onder, And mortally, as I can signes shewe, My platis stronge percid &amp; I-hewe, And myn harneis, forgid bri?t of stele, Mi?t neuere assured ben so wele, In þin Ire whan þou liste to smyte, Þat þi swerd wolde kerue &amp; bite In-to my fleshe, ful depe &amp; ful profounde, As shewiþ ?it be many mortal wounde On my body, large, longe, and wyde, Þat ?it appere vppon euery syde, And day be day ful sore ake and smerte. For whiche þing, me semeþ, þat myn herte Enbolleth newe, now whan I þe se, Of hi?e dispit avengid for to be— So am I fret of envious rage, Þat it may neuer in my brest aswage Til þe vengaunce and þe fatal sut Of cruel deth be on þe execut. And of o þing moste is my greuaunce, Whan I haue fully remembraunce, And in my mynde considre vp &amp; doun, How þou madist a diuisioun Of me, allas! and of Patroclus, So ?onge, so manly, and so vertuous! Whom I loued, as it was skyl &amp; ri?t, Ri?t as my silf, with al my ful my?t, With as hol herte and inly kyndenes As any tonge may tellen or expres. Now hast þou made a departisioun Of vs þat werne by hool affeccioun I-knet in oon, of hertly allyaunce, With-oute partynge or disseueraunce— So enteerly oure feithful hertis tweyen I-lacid werne, and lokkid in o cheyne, Whiche my?t[e] nat for noon aduersite Of lyf nor deth assonder twynned be, Til cruelly þou madest vs departe, Whiche þoru? myn hert so inwardly [doth] darte, Þat it wil neuer, in soth, out of my þou?t. And, trust wel, ful dere shal be bou?t Þe deth of hym, &amp;, be no þing in were, Parauenture or endid be þis ?ere: For vp-on þe, only for his sake, Of cruel deth vengaunce shal be take, I þe ensure, with-outen oþer bond; ?if I may lyue, with myn owne hond I shal of deth don execucioun, With-oute abood or [long] dylacioun. For ri?t requereth, with-outen any drede, Deth for deth, for his final mede; For I my silfe þer-on shal be wroke, Þat þoru? þe world her-after shal be spoke, How Achilles was vengid on his foo, For Patroclus þat he loued so. And þou? þat I be to þe envious, And of þi deth inly desirous, Ne wyte me nat, ne put on me no blame, For wel I wote þou arte to me þe same, And haste my deth many day desyred, And þer-vp-on inwardly conspired: And þus, shortly, as a-twen vs two Þer is but deth, with-oute wordis mo, Whan fortune hath þe tyme shape, I hope fully þou shalt nat eskape— Truste noon oþer, I seie þe outterly!” To whom Hector nat to hastely Answerid ageyn, with sobre countenaunce, Avised wel in al his daliaunce, As he þat was in no þing rek[e]les; And euene þus he spake to Achilles: “Sir Achilles, with-outen any faille, Þou au?test nat in herte to mervaille Þou? with my power &amp; my ful[le] my?t, With herte &amp; wylle, of verray due ri?t, Day be day I þi deth conspire, And euer in oon compasse it &amp; desire, And do my labour erly and eke late To pursue it by ful cruel hate:— Þou ou?teste nat to wondren in no wyse, But fully knowe, by sentence of þe wise, In no maner, who-so taketh hede, Of ri?twysnes it may nat procede, Þat o[u]þer I or any oþer wi?t Shulde hym loue, þat with al his my?t My deth pursuwet[h] pursuweth and destruccioun; And ouer þis, to more confusioun, Hath leide a sege aboute þis cite, On my kynrede and also vppon me, And, þer-vp-on, felly doth preswme With mortal hate of werre to conswme Vs euerychon—I-wis, I can nat fynde In myn herte, as by lawe of kynde, Swiche on to loue, of ri?t nor equite, Nor haue hym chere, sothly, in no degre: For of werre may no frendlyhede, Nor of debate loue a-ri?t procede; For, sothly, loue, moste in special, Of feithfulnes hath his original, In hertis Ioyned by convenience Of oon accorde, whom no difference Of doubilnes may in no degre, Nouþer in Ioye nor aduersite, For lyf nor deth assounder nor disseuere; For where loue is, it contuneth euere, But of hate al is þe contrarie. Of whiche, sothly, from hertis whan þei varie, Procedeþ rancour, at eye, as men may se, Debat, envye, strife, and enmyte, Mortal slau?ter, boþe ny?e and ferre, Moder of whiche, in sothfastnes, is werre, Þe fyn wher-of, longe or it be do, Seuerith hertis &amp; frendship kut a-two, And causeth loue to be leide ful lowe.

For wel I wote, of olde &amp; nat of newe, Þat ?e Grekis, gadred here in on, Of surquedie are fonned euerychon, Only for want of discresioun, To vndirtaken of presumpcioun So hi?e a þing, a sege for to leyn, And ?oure silfe to ouercharge in veyn With emprises whiche, with-outen fable, Bene of wei?t to ?ou inportable, And þe peis of so gret heuynes, Þat, finally, it wil ?ou alle oppres, And ?oure pride avalen and encline, Þe berþen eke enbowe bak &amp; chyne, And vnwarly cause ?ou to falle Or ?e haue done, I seie to oon and alle! And, ouermore, be ful in surete, Þou Achilles—I speke vn-to þe,— Þat fatal deth first schal þe assaille, To-forn þi swerde in any þing availle Ageyn[e]s me, for al þi worþines; And ?if so be, þat so gret hardines, Corage of wil, vigour, force, or my?t Meven þin herte, be manhod as a kny?t To take on þe, as in dorynge do, For to darreyne here betwene vs two Þilke quarel, how-so þat be-falle, For þe whiche þat we striuen alle, I wil assent, pleinly, to Iuparte, Til þat þe deth oon of vs departe— Þer is no more, but þat þes lordis here, Kynges, princes wil accorde I-fere Þat it be do, fully be oon assent, And hold[e] stable, of herte &amp; of entent, With-in a felde only þat we tweyne, As I haue seide, þis quarel may dareyne, And it finyshe, be þis condicioun: Þat ?if it hap þoru? þin hi?e renoun Me to venquyshe or putten at outraunce, I wil ?ou maken fully assuraunce, Þat firste my lord, Priamus þe kyng, Shal vn-to Grekis in al maner þing, With septre &amp; crowne, holly him submitte, And in a point varie nouþer flitte, Fully to ?elde to ?oure subiectioun Al his lordshipe with-Inne Troye toun; And his legis in captiuite Shal goon her weye oute of þis cite, And leue it quit in ?oure gouernaunce, With-oute strif or any variaunce. And here-vp-on, to maken surete, To deuoyde al ambiguyte, To-fore þe goddis be oþe &amp; sacramente We shal be swore, in ful good entent; And, ouermore, oure feith also to saue, To assure ?ou, in plegge ?e shal haue, Þe mene while to kepe hem on ?our syde, At ?oure chois hostagis to abide, From Troye toun, of þe worþieste Þat ?e liste chese, &amp; also of þe beste, So þat ?e shal of no þing be in were Of al þat euere þat I seie ?ou here. And, Achilles, with-oute wordes mo, ?if þat þou liste accorde ful þer-to Þat I haue seide, þin honour to encrese, To make þis werre sodeinly to sese, Þat likly is for to laste longe Be-twene Troyens &amp; þe Grekis stronge, Þou shalt nat only with honour &amp; with fame Þoru?-oute þe world getyn þe a name, But þer-with-al—&amp; þat is nat a lyte— Þoru? þi kny?thod to many man profite, Þat fro þe deth shal eskape a-lyue, And to his contre hol and sounde aryve, Þat likly arn, by cruel auenture, For to be ded, ?if þe werre endure. Come of, þerfor, &amp; late nat be proloigned, But lat þe day atwen vs two be Ioyned, As I haue seide, in condicioun, ?if in diffence only of þis toun I haue victorie by fortune on þe, I axe nat, but anoon þat ?e Breke vp sege, and þe werre lete, And suffreth vs to lyuen in quiete, In-to Grece hom whan ?e or ar goon.” To whiche þing Achilles anon, Hoot in his Ire and furious also, Brennynge ful hote for anger &amp; for wo, Assentid is, with a dispitous chere, And gan anoon to Hector dresse him nere, And seide he wolde delyuere him outterly, Fro poynt to point, his axyng by &amp; by, And þer-in made noon excepcioun, But of hool herte and entencioun His requeste accepted euerydel, And, as it sempte, liked it ri?t wel. And, for his parte, he caste a gloue doun, In signe &amp; tokene of confirmacioun, For lyfe or deth þat he wil holde his day Ageyn Hector, hap what hap[pe] may, Vn-to þe whiche Hector lifly sterte, And toke it vp, with as glad an herte As euere ?it dide man or kny?t, Þat quarel toke with his foo to fi?t: Þer can no man, in soth, a-ri?t deuyse How glad he was of þis hi?e emprise, Of whiche þe noise &amp; þe grete soun Ran to þe eris of Agamenoun; And he anoon cam doun to her tent With alle þe lordis of his parlement, Where Achilles &amp; Hector wern I-fere, To wit her wille as in þis matere: Wher þei wolden assenten finally To putte þe quarel ful in iuparty, Of ouþer part, atwene þese kny?tes tweyne, As ?e han herde, it fully to darayne. And with o vois Grekis it denye, And seide þei nolde of swiche a companie, Of kynges, dukis, and lordis eke also, Boþe life &amp; deth Iuparten atwene two, Nor to [þe] course of Fortune hem submitte, Þat can hir face alday chaunge &amp; flitte. And some of Troye, in conclusioun, Iuparte nolde her lyues nor her toun, In þe hondis only of a kny?t To putten al in auenture of fi?t, Priam except, whiche, sothly, in þis caas, With-in hym silf fully assentid was, Pleinly to haue put &amp; set in iuparte Holy þe honour of his regalye,— Supposynge ay, as maked is memorie, Þat Hector shuld haue had þe victorie Of þis emprise, ?if it he toke on honde. But for Priam my?t[e] nat with-stonde Ageyn so many of oon entencioun Þat were contrarie to his oppinioun, Boþe of Grekis and on Troye side, [He] helde his pes, and lete it ouere-slyde. And so þe Grekis parted ben echon; And Hector is from Achilles goon Home to Troye, where I him leue a while, Whiles þat I directe shal my stile To telle of Troylus þe lamentable wo, Whiche þat he made to parte his lady fro. Of the sorowe that Troilus made when Cressaide shulde depart. Allas! Fortune, gery and vnstable, And redy ay [for] to be chaungable; Whan folk most triste in þi stormy face, Liche her desire þe fully to embrace: Þanne is þi Ioye aweye to turne &amp; wryþe, Vp-on wrechis þi power for to kiþe— Record on Troylus, þat fro þi whele so lowe By fals envie þou hast ouer-þrowe, Oute of þe Ioye which [þat] he was Inne, From his lady to make him for to twynne Whan he best wende for to haue be surid. And of þe wo þat he hath endured, I muste now helpe hym to compleyne, Whiche at his herte felt[e] so gret peyne, So inward wo, and so gret distresse, More þan I haue konnynge to expresse, Whan he knew þe partynge of Cryseide— Almoste for wo &amp; for peyne he deyde, And fully wiste she departe shal By sentence and Iugement fynal Of his fader, ?oue in parlement. For whiche, with wo &amp; torment al to-rent, He was in point to haue falle in rage, Þat no man my?t apese nor a-swage Þe hid[de] peynes which in his breste gan dare: For lik a man in furie he gan fare, And swiche sorwe day &amp; ny?t to make, In compleyninge only for hir sake. For whan he sawe þat she schulde a-weie, He leuer had, pleinly, for to deye Þan to lyve be-hynde in hir absence: For hym þou?t, with-outen hir presence He nas but ded—þer is no more to seine. And in-to terys he be-gan to reyne, With whiche his eyen gon[ne] for to bolle, And in his breste þe si?es vp to swolle, And þe sobbyng of his sorwes depe, Þat he ne can nat but rore and wepe, So sore loue his herte gan constreyne. And she ne felt nat a litel peyne, But wepte also, and pitously gan crye, Desyring ay þat she my?te dye Raþer þan parte from hym oute of Troye, Hir owne kny?t, hir lust, hir liues Ioye, Þat be hir chekis þe teris doun distille, And fro hir eyen þe rounde dropis t[r]ille, And al for-dewed han hir blake wede; And eke vntressid hir her abrod gan sprede, Like to gold wyr, for-rent &amp; al to-torn, I-plukked of, &amp; nat with sheris shorn. And ouer þis, hir freshe rosen hewe, Whilom y-meint with white lilies newe, With woful wepyng pitously disteyned, And like herbis in April al be-reyned, Or floures freshe, with þe dewes swete, Ri?t so hir chekis moiste wern &amp; wete With cristal water, vp ascendyn[g] hi?e Out of her breste in-to hir heuenly eye; And ay amonge hir lamentacioun, Ofte siþe she fil aswone doun, Dedly pale, for-dymmed in hir si?t, And ofte seide: “allas! myn owne kny?t, Myn owne Troylus, allas! whi shal we parte!— Raþer late Deth with his spere darte Þoru? myn hert, &amp; þe veynes kerue, And with his rage do me for to sterue— Raþer, allas! þan fro my kny?t to twynne! And of þis wo, o Deth, þat I am Inne, Whi nyl þou come &amp; help[e] make an ende? For how shulde I oute of Troye wende, He abide, and I to Grekis goon, Þer to dwelle amonge my cruel foon? Allas! allas! I, woful creature, Howe shulde I þer, in þe werre endure— I, wreche woman, but my silf allone, Amonge þe men of armys euerychon!” Þus gan she cryen al þe longe day; Þis was hir compleint, with ful gret affray, Hir pitous noyse, til it drowe to ny?t, Þat vn-to hir hir owne trewe kny?t, Ful triste &amp; heuy, cam ageyn[e]s eve, ?if he my?t hir counforte or releue. But he, in soth, hath Cryseide founde Al in a swowe, lyggynge on þe grounde; And pitously vn-to hir he wente, With woful chere, &amp; hir in armys hent, And toke hir vp: &amp; þan atwen hem two Be-gan of new swiche a dedly wo, Þat it was rouþe &amp; pite for to sene; For she of cher pale was and grene, And he of colour liche to ashes dede; And fro hir face was goon al þe rede, And in his chekis deuoided was þe blod, So wofully atwene hem two it stood. For she ne my?t nat a worde speke, And he was redy with deth to be wreke Vp-on hym silfe, his nakid swerd be-side; And she ful ofte gan to grounde glide Out of his armys, as she fel a-swowne; And he hym silf gan in teris drowne: She was as stille &amp; dowmb as any ston; He had a mouþe, but wordis had he non;— Þe weri spirit flikered in hir breste, And of deth stood vnder arreste, With-oute meinpris, sothly, as of lyf. And þus þe[r] was, as it sempte, a strif, Whiche of hem two shuld[e] firste pace: For deth portreied in her ouþer face With swiche colour as men go to her graue. Of the worshipful recommendacyone that the monke of Bury, þat translate þis boke, gave Chaucere þe chef poete off Breteyne. And þus in wo þei gan to-gidre raue, Disconsolat, al þe longe ny?t, Þat, in gode feith, ?if I shulde ari?t Þe processe hool of here boþe sorwe Þat þei made til þe nexte morwe,— Fro point to point it to specefie, It wolde me ful longe occupie Of euery þinge to make mencioun, And tarie me in my translacioun ?if I shulde in her wo procede; But, me semeth, þat it is no nede, Sith my maister Cha?cer her-a-forn In þis mater hath so wel hym born, In his boke of Troylus and Cryseyde Whiche he made longe or þat he deyde, Rehersinge firste, how Troilus was contrarie [For] To assendyn vp on Lovis steire, And how þat he, for al his surquedie, After be-cam oon of þe companye Of Lovis folke, for al his olde game, Whan Cupide maked hym ful tame, And brou?t him lowe to his subieccioun, In a temple as he walked vp &amp; doun, Whan he his ginnes and his hokis leide Amyd þe eyen cerclid of Cryseyde, Whiche on þat day he my?t[e] nat asterte: For þoru? his brest percid &amp; his herte, He wente hym home, pale, sike, &amp; wan. And in þis wise Troylus first be-gan To be a seruaunt, my maister telleth þus, Til he was holpe aftir of Pandarus, Þoru? whos comforte &amp; mediacioun (As in his boke is maked mencioun) With gret labour firste he cam to grace, And so contuneth by certeyn ?eris space, Til Fortune gan vp-on hym frowne, Þat she from hym mvst goon oute of towne Al sodeynly, and neuer hym after se. Lo! here þe fyn of false felicite, Lo! here þe ende of worldly brotilnes, Of fleshy lust, lo! here thunstabilnes, Lo! here þe double variacioun Of wor[l]dly blisse and transmvtacioun: Þis day in myrthe &amp; in wo to-morwe! For ay þe fyn, allas! of Ioie is sorwe. For now Cryseide, with þe kyng Thoas, For Anthenor shal go forþe, allas!— Vn-to Grekis, and euer with hem dwelle! Þe hool[e] story Cha?cer kan ?ow telle ?if þat ?e liste—no man bet alyue— Nor þe processe halfe so wel discryue: For he owre englishe gilt[e] with his sawes, Rude and boistous firste be olde dawes, Þat was ful fer from al perfeccioun, And but of litel reputacioun, Til þat he cam, &amp;, þoru? his poetrie, Gan oure tonge firste to magnifie, And adourne it with his elloquence— To whom honour, laude, &amp; reuerence, Þoru?-oute þis londe ?oue be &amp; songe, So þat þe laurer of oure englishe tonge Be to hym ?oue for his excellence, —Ri?t a[s] whilom by ful hi?e sentence, Perpetuelly for a memorial, Of Columpna by þe cardynal To Petrak Fraunceis was ?ouen in Ytaille— Þat þe report neuere after faille, Nor þe honour dirked of his name, To be registred in þe house of fame Amonge oþer in þe hi?este sete, My maister Galfride, as for chefe poete Þat euere was ?it in oure langage; Þe name of whom shal passen in noon age, But euer ylyche, with-oute eclipsinge, shyne. And, for my part, I wil neuer fyne, So as I can, hym to magnifie In my writynge, pleinly, til I dye; And God, I praye, his soule bring in Ioy. Howe Guydo rebukethe Troylus. And of the mutabilite and varyant chaunge of womenne. And where I lefte, I wil ageyn of Troie Þe story telle,—&amp; first how þat Guydo With-in his boke speketh Troylus to, Rebukyng hym ful vncurtesly, Þat he so sette his herte folili Vp-on Cryseide, ful of doubilnes: For in his boke as Guydo list expresse, Þat hir teris &amp; hir compleynynge, Hir wordis white, softe, &amp; blaundyshynge, Wer meynt with feynyng &amp; with flaterie, And outward farsed with many a fals[e] lye; For vnder his was al þe variaunce, Cured a-boue with feyned countenaunce, As wommen kan falsly teris borwe— In her herte þou? þer be no sorwe— Lik as þei wolde of verray trouþe deie. Þei can þink oon, and a-noþer seie, As a serpent vnder floures faire His venym hydeth, where he doþ repaire— Þe sugre a-forn, þe galle hid be-hynde, As approprid is vn-to hir kynde To be dyuers &amp; double of nature, Raþest deceyvynge whan men most assure: For vnder colour euery þing þei wirke, Þe faire aboue, þe foule in þe dirke Þei hide so, þat no man may espie; And þou? so be, þat with a woful eye Þei can outward wepyn pitously, Þe toþer eye can lau?[e] couertly,— Whos sorwes alle are temprid with allaies. And her colour euer is meynt with raies: For vp-on chaunge and mutabilite Stant hool her trust and [her] surete, So þat þei ben sure in doubilnes, And alwey double in her sikernes, Semynge oon whan þei best can varie, Likest to acorde whan þei be contrarie; And þus þei ben variaunte in a-corde, And holest seme whan þer is discord. And Guydo seith, how þer are fewe or noon Þat in her herte apaied is with oon; And ?it þei can, be it to oon or tweyne, To þre or foure, in her speche feyne, Like as þei wern to oon &amp; to no moo Hool in her loue, for wele &amp; eke for wo, Þat eueryche shal of hym silfe deme Þat he be next, lik as it doth seme. And þus in hope stant eche of hem alle, Þe trewest ay redyest to falle; Who serueth best, nexte to ben appaired: And þus in chaunge al her loue is feired. Lat no man trust, but cache whan he may; Far-wel to-morwe, þou? it be sure to-day!— Þe faire of chaunge lasteth ouer ?ere, But it is foly for to byen to dere Þilke tresour, whiche harde is to possede, But fleeth aweye whan men þer-of most nede. And ?if it hap þat no chapman be (As seith Guydo), ?it al day men may se It shewed oute at large fenestrallis, On chaumbres hi?e, &amp; lowe doun in hallis, And in wyndowes eke in euery strete; And also eke men may with hem mete At pilgrymages and oblacioun[e]s, At spectacles in cytes and in townys (As seit[h] Guydo), and al is for to selle:— But after hym I can no ferþer telle. And eke he seith, in his sentament, Þer is no fraude fully equipollent To þe fraude and slei?ty compassyng Of a womman, nor like in worchynge: For who þat set al his feithfulnes, Wenynge in hem to fynde stabilnes, He shal hem fynde stedefaste as þe mone, Þat is in point for to chaunge sone. ?if he be ?onge, þei cast hym in a rage; ?if he be olde, he falleth in dotage; “Wherfore, my counseil is to boþe two: Cast of þe bridel, and li?tly lete hem go.” Þus techeþ Guydo, God wot, &amp; not I!— Þat haþ delyt to speke cursidly Alwey of wommen þoru?-out al his bok, As men may se, who-so list to loke. To hem he had envie in special, Þat, in good feith, I am ri?t wroþe with al, Þat he with hem list so to debate; For Ire of whiche, þe latyn to translate, Inwardly myn herte I felte blede, Of hi?e dispit, his clausis for to rede, Þat resownede, in conclusioun, Only of malys to accusacioun Of þis women—ful euel mote he þriue!— So generally her sect[e] to discryve, —Whiche made nat, þoru? indiscrecioun, Of good nor badde noon excepcioun. He was to blame—foule mote he falle!— For cause of oon for to hindren alle: For I dar wel affermen by þe rode, Ageyn oon badde ben an hundrid gode; And þou? som oon double be &amp; newe, It hindreth nat to hem þat be trewe. And be exaumple, also, þou? he shewe Þat som oon whilom was a shrewe, Þei þat be gode take shal noon hede, For it noon hindrynge is to wommanhede, Þou? two or þre can be double &amp; feyne: For þer ageyn, sothly, at Coleyne, Of virgines, inly ful of grace, Ellevene þousand in þat holy place A man may fynde; and in oure kalendere Ful many maide parfit and entere, Whiche to þe deth stable wern and trewe. For somme of hem with þe rosen hew Of martirdom þe blisse of heuene wonne; And somme also, as bokis telle konne, With þe lillye of virginite And violettis of parfit chastite, Ascendid ben a-boue þe sterris clere And þe cercle of þe nynthe spere, Where Ioie is euere, and gladnes eterne. Wherefor, in soth, as I can discerne, Þou? som clerkis of shrewis haue myssaid, Lat no good womman þer-of be myspaid: For lak of oon, alle are nou?t to blame, And eke of men may be seide þe same. For to þe trewe it is no reprefe, Þou? it so be anoþer be a þefe; For what is he þe werse in his degre, Þou? þe toþer be honged on a tre?— Nor vn-to wommen hindring is it noon, Among an hundrid þou? þat þer be oon Of gouernaunce þat be vicious! For þer ageyn a þousand vertuous, ?if þat ?e liste, li?tly ?e may fynde. And þou? Guydo writ, þei han of kynde To be double, men shulde it goodly take, And þer ageyn no maner grucching make: Nature in werkynge hath ful gret power, And it wer harde for any þat is here Þe cours of hir to holden or restreyne; For she wil nat be guyed be no reyne, To be coarted of hir due ri?t. Þerfore, eche man with al his ful[le] my?t Shulde þanke God, and take paciently: For ?if wommen be double naturelly, Why shulde men leyn on hem þe blame? For þou? myn auctor hindre so her name In his writinge, only of Cryseide, And vp-on hir swiche a blame leide, My counseil is, li?tly ouer passe Wher he mysseith of hir in any place, —To hindre wommen, ouþer eve or morwe— Taketh noon hede, but late him be with sorwe, And skippeth ouer wher ?e list nat rede, Til ?e come where þat Dyomede For hir was sent in-to Troye toun, Where ceriously is maked mencioun, First, how þat she to hym delyuered was For Anthenor and for kyng Thoas, And how Troilus gan hir to conveie, With many oþer, to bringe hir on þe weie; And after þis, how þat Dyomede, By þe weie gan hir bridel lede Til he hir brou?t to hir fadres tent; And how Calchas, in ful good entent, Received hir, logged þer he lay, And of hir speche duryng al þat day, And al þe maner hool and euerydel— Al is rehersid ceriously and wel In Troylus boke, as ?e han herd me seyn— To write it efte, I holde it wer but veyn. But Guydo seith, longe or it was ny?t, How Cryseyde for-soke hir owne kny?t, And ?af hir herte vn-to Dyomede Of tendirnes and of wommanhede, Þat Troilus wexe in hir herte as colde, With-oute fire as ben þese asshes olde. I can noon oþer excusacioun, But only kyndes transmutacioun, Þat is appropred vn-to hir nature, Selde or neuer stable to endure, Be experience as men may ofte lere. But now ageyn [vn-]to my matere I mvt resort, þou? þat I be ferre, As I be-gan to writen of þe werre. Howe worthy Ector, lyche Mars hym silf, toke the felde with mony worthy in his company, and scleughe sondrey kynges, and, amonge alle other, with his swerde departede Merion atweyne. The tyme passed of þe trew y-take, Þe next[e] morwe, whan Titan haþ forsake Þe vnder party of oure Emysperye, Where al þe ny?t he hadde be ful merye With Aurora liggyng by his side,— But in his bedde hym list no lenger bide, But shope hym vp, &amp; cast his stremys shene On Troye wall, whan Hector, armyd clene, In-to þe felde faste gan hym hi?e, Fiftene þousand in his companye Of worþi knytes and of manly men. And, as I fynde, Troylus had[de] ten Of kny?tes eke, þat his baner swe; And, in al haste, Paris gan remewe Oute of þe toun, with hem of Perce londe; And eche of hem a bowe had in his honde, And arwis sharpe trussid by her side; And of kny?tes þat aboute hym ride He had also þre þousand, as I fynde. And Dephebus next hym cam be-hynde With þre þousand kny?tes, armyd clene, On whos platis þe sonne shone ful shene; And next hym cam þe Troyan Eneas. And, as I rede, sothly, þat þer was Þe same day with hem of Troye toun An hundrid þousand kny?tes of renoun, Lik as recordeth Dares Frigyus, And in his boke Guydo writeth þus. And with þe Grekis, al to-forn þat day, With seuene þousand went[e] Menelay, Kny?tes echon, whiche he dide lede; And with as many went[e] Dyomede. And next hem folwith þe hardy Achilles, With his meyne callid Myrundones; And ?antipus, þe worþi kyng, eke had Þre þousand kny?tes, whiche þat he lad In-to þe felde ageyn hem of þe toun; And alderlaste cam Agamenoun With swiche a noumbre of þe Grekis felle, Þat wonder is for to here telle. And whan þe wardis in þe feld abrod Had take her place, with-oute more abood, A Grekishe kyng, whiche þat Phillis hi?t, Anon as he of Hector had a si?t, Towardis hym, sitting on his stede, With his spere he gan hym fast[e] spede; But whan Hector haþ his commynge seyn, He hent a spere, &amp; rod to hym ageyn; And þoru? his shelde &amp; his platis rounde He ?af to hym his last[e] fatal wounde. Vp-on whos deth avengid for to be, Ful many Greke gan on Hector fle. And, first of al, þe worþi kyng famus, Þat of Grekis was callid ?antipus, Of hi?e disdeyn only for Phillis sake, Toward Hector hath his cours I-take, And with a spere ran at hym ful ri?t; But Hector first hit him with swiche a my?t, Þoru? his harneis with his speris hed, Þat ?antipus fil to grounde ded,— Þe deth of whom þe Grekis sore pleyne, And dide her my?t &amp; her besi peyne, On euery halfe, furious and wood, Tavenge hem on Troyanysshe blood. And þoru? her passinge cruel hardinesse Þei be-gan Troyens so to oppresse, Þat many oon þat day ne my?t a-sterte, Þoru? þe breste y-perced and þe herte, For to be ded &amp; slayn amonge þe pres,— Amongis whiche, cruel Achilles Slowe Lychaon and Euforbius, Noble kny?tes, ri?t worþi and famus, Þat wern y-come oute of her contre Ageyn Grekis to helpe þe cyte. And while Troyens constreyned [wer] so narwe, Were it with spere, quarel, darte, or arwe, Hector was wounded þoru?-oute þe viser In-to þe face, þat, like a ryver, Þe rede blood doun be-gan to raille, By his harneis þoru? his aventaille; Wher-of astonyd whan þei had a si?t, Ful many Troyan toke hym to þe fli?t, And to þe cite fast[e] gan hem drawe; And at þe chas [ful] many oon was slawe, Or þei my?t out of þe felde remewe. And euer in oon þe Grekis after swe, Vn-to þe wallis almost of þe toun, Til þat Hector, þe Troyan champioun, Of his kny?thod gan to taken hede, Al-be his wounde sore gan [to] blede,— [?it] Of manhod he gan hem recomforte, And maugre hem in-to þe felde resorte; Namly, whan he had inspeccioun, On þe wallis and touris of þe toun, Howe þat Eleyne, and Eccuba þe quene, And his suster, faire Pollicene, With many oþer lady gan beholde— Hym þou?t anoon his herte gan to colde Of verray shame his kny?tes shold[e] fle; And, lik a lyoun in his cruelte, He made hem tourne, manly euerychon. And in his wey he mette Merion, A Grekishe kyng, þat was ny?e allie To Achilles, as bokis specefie; And with his swerd Hector smot hym so, Þat he hym rof vp-on pecis two. And Achilles, whan he sawe hym ded, Partid on two, euene fro þe hed, He hent a spere, &amp; þou?t he nold[e] faille To hitte Hector þoru? sheld, plate, &amp; maille, And rood to hym ful enviously; And myd þe sheld be smet hym cruelly. But with þe strok Hector neuer-a-del Remeveth nat, he sat so fast and wel; But with his swerd anoon, &amp; tarieþ nou?t, Vn-to Achille, with an envious þou?t, He kny?tly ran vp-on his courser; And on his creste, þat shon so bri?t &amp; cler, With swiche a my?t Hector haþ hym smet, Þat he percid þoru? his basenet, And raced eke from his aventaille With þat stroke many pece of maille, Þat Achilles constreyned was of nede, Maugre his my?t, to stakren on his stede, To enclyne, and to bow his bak. Of the wordys of worthy Ector to Achile; &amp; howe Dyomede sent Troylus hors to Cresseyde. At whiche tyme Hector to hym spak, And seide: “Achille, I do ful wel aduerte Þe grete envie of þi cruel herte, And specially þat þou haste to me; But ?it be war, I counseil[le] þe, Þi-silfe to put so in auenture: For [of] o þing I pleynly þe ensure, As I desire at my lust som day Here in þe felde ?if I þe mete may, Trust me ri?t wel, þer geyneþ no socour, Þat I shal so aquite þi labour, So mortally, I do þe to vndirstonde, With þis swerd þat I holde on honde, Þat with þe lif þou shalt nat eskape, So cruelly þe vengaunce shal be take, Eft whan we mete, evene vp-on þin hede.” Of whiche þing whan Achilles toke hede, Aduertinge al þat he herde hym seyn,— Ri?t as he wold haue ?oue answer a?eyn, Worþi Troylus kny?tly entrid Inne, [And] Maked hem asoundre for to twynne; And þoru? þe manhod of his companye Of worþi kny?tes, þat he dide guye, And hi?e prowes of his owne my?t, He haþ þe Grekis put ageyn to fli?t, And slayn of hem þat day—out of drede— Sixe hundrid kny?tes, sothly, as I rede. For los of whiche þe Grekis fast[e] fle To hir tentis, of necessite; Til Menelay dide his besy cure To maken hem þe feld ageyn recure, Þoru? whos manhod þat day—out of doute— And worþi kny?tes þat wern him aboute, Þe feld of Grekis recured was anoon. But þo from Troye cam kyng Odemon, And in al haste possible þat he may, He cam enbusshed vppon Menelay, And hym vnhorseth in þe silfe place, And swiche a wounde ?af him in þe face, Þat fro þe deth he wende nat eskape; And, dout[e]les, anoon he had hym take With helpe of Troylus, &amp; lad vn-to þe toun, But of Grekis swiche a pres cam doun To reskue hym in þis grete nede, Þat Odemon no ferþer my?t[e] lede Kyng Menelay toward þe cite, Whan Dyomede cam with his meyne, And many worþi, ridyng hym aboute, And Troylus met, among[es] al þe route, Al sodeynly, of hap or auenture, And hym vnhorsith, as it was his evre; And after þat, anoon he hent his stede, And bad a squier þat he shuld it lede Vn-to Cryseyde, only for hir sake, Beseching hir þat she wolde it take As for a gyfte of hir owne man, Sith he þat day for hir loue it wan Amyd þe feld, þoru? his grete my?t, Of hym þat was whilom hir owne kny?t. And he in haste on his weie is went, And þer-of made vn-to hir present, Preying hir, in ful humble wyse, Þis litel gifte þat she nat dispise, But it receive for a remembraunce, And with al þis, þat it be plesaunce, Of verray pite and of wommanhede On hir seruaunt, callid Diomede, To remembre, þat was be-come her kny?t. Of the comfortable answere that double Cresseyde gave to þe Messenger that kame frome Dyomede. And she anoon, with hert[e] glad and li?t, Ful wommanly bad hym repeire ageyn Vn-to his lord, &amp; pleynly to hym seyn Þat she ne my?t, of verray kynd[e]nesse, Of womanhede, nor of gentilnes, Refusen hym, platly, from hir grace, Þat was to hir, þere in straunge place, So kynde fo[u]nde, and so counfortable In euery þing, and so seruisable, Þat it may nat li?tly oute of mynde To þinke on hym þat was so trewe &amp; kynde. With whiche answere þe messanger is goon Vn-to his lord, and told it hym anoon, Word by word, like as she hath seide; And he þer-of was ful wel apayde, Þat hym þou?t, pleinly, in his herte, He was recured of his peynes smerte; And forþe he had hym in armys as a kny?t. But þilke day, durynge þe stronge fi?t Þei of Troye so manly han hem born, Þat Grekis my?t nat stonden hem a-forn; For to her tentis þei han hem chacid doun, Þat, nadde ben kyng Agamenoun, Grekis had be dryue oute of þe feld. Þe whiche þing anoon as he beheld, He cam vp-on with many worþi man; And þo of newe þe slau?ter ageyn began On euery half vp-on þe large pleyn, Þat Grekis han Troyens so be-leyn, Þat efte a-?eyn þei haue þe feld [y-]wonne, So þat Troyens, constreyned, þo be-gonne To lese her lond, til Pollydamas, Whiche with his kny?tes þer be-side was, Gan falle vppon, endelonge þe grene, Hem of Troye [ful] manly to sustene. And þe Grekis he gan so to enchase, Whan he cam in, þat þei loste her place, And to þe strond, evene vppon þe se, Þoru? his kny?thod he made hem for to fle, Of her lif þat þei wern in drede. Þe whiche meschef whan þat Dyomede Be-held &amp; sawe howe Pollydamas Mortally pursued on þe chas On hors[e]-bak, in þe feld a-fere, With cruel herte hent anoon a spere, And, springing out, rod to him ful ri?t; And he ageyn, to quite hym lik a kny?t, And he þat list on no party feyne, Of his stede held ageyn þe reyn, And rau?t a spere, &amp; þrewe [it] in þe reste, And Diomede he smet so on þe brest, Þat mortally, liche as it is founde, He vnhorsid hym with a greuous wounde. And ri?t anoon, with a kny?tly herte, Pollydamas al attonys sterte Vn-to þe horse of þis Diomede, And by þe reyne proudly gan it lede Vn-to Troylus, wher he on fote stood, Al for-baþed in þe Grekis blod, On euery halfe whiche þat he shadde —Amongis hem so kny?tly he him hadde, Þat þei ne my?t endure nor sustene, His sharpe swerde grounde was so kene,— And deliuerly, maugre al his foon, In-to þe sadel [vp] he sterte anoon, Of verray force, armyd as he was; And vnwarly, by auenture or cas, With sharpe swerdis, for þe nonys whet, As Achilles and he to-gidre mette, Worþi Troylus, of rancour &amp; of pride, Achilles smot þat he fil a-side Doun of his hors, lowe to þe grounde. And nat-with-stondinge his grene mortal wounde, He ros ageyn, &amp; faste gan hym spede, ?if þat he my?t to recure his stede: But al for nou?t, it wold[e] nat availle, For sodenly, with a fresshe bataille, Þei of Troye, as made is mencioun, In compas wyse beset hym enviroun, Eueryche of hem armyd bri?t &amp; clene. And Hector þo, in his furious tene, As Dares telleþ al þe maner how, Þe same day a þousand kny?tes slow, Whiche him withstode only in diffence, For Achilles to make resistence, Þat tyme of deth stondynge in iupartie: Þat certeinly, but ?if bokis lye, Be liklyhed he my?t[e] nat eskape In þat meschef to be ded or take, Hector on hym was so furious. But, as I rede, Thelamonius Reskued hym in þis grete nede, And causid hym to recure his stede, Nat-with-stondynge al þe grete pres: For þe duke and lord of Athenes Was in þis cas, of hert &amp; hool entent, To helpe Achille wonder dilligent, Þat with hym ladde many noble kny?t. But for be-cause þat it drowe to ny?t, As þe story maketh rehersaille, Þei made an ende as of þat bataille, And þei of Troye entrid be þe toun. And after þat, as made is mencioun, By and by, havyng no delaies, Mortally þei fau?t[e] þritty dayes With-outen eny Interrupcioun, Of ouþer parte to gret destruccioun. But aldermost, for al her gret[e] pride, Þei lost most on þe Grekis side; Save Priamus loste in special Sixe of his sonys called naturel, For whom he had ful gret hevines. And as þe stori recordeþ eke expresse, Þis mene while Hector, in certeyn, In his face wounded was a-geyn. Howe Kynge Priamus sent to þe Grekis for a trewe of vj monethes; &amp; of þe discripcyon of Yllyon. And þus þei han, in þis cruel rage, On euery part receiued gret damage, Til [kyng] Priam from Troye sent[e] doun For a trewe vn-to Agamenoun, For sixe monþes, ?if he assent[e] wolde. And þer-vppon he haþ a conseil holde With his lordis, what were beste to do; And þei echon accorded be þere-to, And graunt his axynge, in conclusioun. And al þis while, with-Innen Ylyoun, Duringe þe pes, on ouþer part assurid, Of his woundis fully to be cured Lay worþi Hector, protectour of þe toun. But of þis riche, royal, chefe dongoun, Þat Ylyoun in Troye bare þe name, Whiche of billedyng had[de] swiche a fame— ?if þat I shulde comende it vp-so-doun, As Dares doth in his discripcioun— I wante konnynge my termys to aplie; For in his boke as he doth specefie, In al þis world was þer noon so riche, Of hi?e devis, nor of bildynge liche, Þe whiche stood, þe more to delyte, As he recordeth, on twelfe stonys white Of alabastre, shortly to conclude; And twenty pas was þe latitude, Þe ground y-pauyd þoru?-out with cristal, And vp-on hei?t parformyd euery wal Of alle stonys þat any man can fynde, Of diamauntis and saphir[i]s ynde, þe royal ruby, so orient and li?t, Þat þe dirknes of þe dymme ny?t Enchacid was with his bemys shene; And euere amonge wern emeraudis grene, With stonys alle, þat any maner man In þis world deuyse or rekne can, Þat wern of pris, valu, or richesse. And þer were wrought, of large and gret roundnes, (As seith Dares) of yvory pylers, And þer-vp-on set at þe corners, Of purid gold, al aboue on hei?t, Þer wer ymages wonder huge of wei?t, With many perle and many riche stoon; And euery piler in þe halle had oon, Of massif gold, burned clere and bri?t, And wonderful to any mannys si?t: For of þis werke þe merveillous facioun Was more lik, by estymacioun, A þinge y-made &amp; founded be fairye, Þan any werke wrou?t be fantasie, Þoru? wit of man, as be liklynes. For in his boke Dares bereth witnes, Þat it was like to rekne, siyt and al, In apparence a þing celestial:— Seth in his boke—?e gete no more of me, For but in writinge I my?t neuere it se, Al-be alle oþer þat it dide excelle; No more þer-of I þinke now to telle. How Kenge Priamus worschipfully burede his sonnes naturel; &amp; howe Dyomede was wondide with loves darte. But retourne ageyn to Priamvs, Whiche al þis while was inly corious, With [al] his my?t and his besy cure, To ordeyne for þe sepulture Of his sonys þat afore were dede. And al þat tyme sike laie Diomede, With Louys dart woundid to þe herte, As he þat felt inwardly gret smerte, Of woful si?es, wiche in his brest abraide Ful ofte a day for loue of Cryseyde; For he was shake with a feuere newe, Þat causid him to be ful pale of hewe, And to wexe boþe megre and lene; For pitously he gan hym to abstene Fro mete &amp; drinke, and from [al] solace, As it was sene in his dedly face; And ofte a day to hir he wolde pleyne Of his dissese and his mortal peyne, Preiynge, of grace þat she wolde se, Vpon his wo for to han pite, And of mercy for to taken hede Of hir seruaunt, only of wommanhede, Or pleinly elles—þer is no more to seie,— For hir sake he seide he wolde deye. But konnyngly, &amp; in ful slei?ty wyse, To kepe hym lowe vnder hir seruyse, With delaies she hilde hym forþe on honde, And maked hym in a were to stonde, Ful vnsur betwene hope &amp; dispeire. And whan þat grace shulde haue had repeire To putte hym oute of al heuynes, Daunger of newe brou?t hym in distresse; And with disdeyn to encrese his peine, Of double were she brou?t hym in a treyne, As wommen kan holde a man ful narwe, Whan he is hurt with Cupides arwe, To sette on hym many fel assaies, Day be day to putte hym in delaies, To stonde vnsur betwixe hope &amp; drede, Ri?t as Cryseyde lefte Diomede, Of entent to sette hym more a-fire, As þis wommen kyndely desyre, Whan þei a man haue brou?t in a traunce, Vn-euenly to hange him in balaunce, Of hope &amp; drede to lynke hym in a cheyne, Ay of þe fyn vnsure of boþe tweyne, To dryue him forþe ?eres hem to serue, And do no force wher he lyue or sterue: Þis is þe fyn of Lovis fyri rage. And for she wolde haue hym in seruage, She lokkid hym vnder swiche a keye, Þat he wot nat wher to lyue or deye; And in doute þus I lete hym dwelle, And forþe I wil of þe story telle, And to my mater eke resorte ageyn. And as myn auctor recordeþ in certeyn, After þe trewe were wered out &amp; goon, Twelve daies, swyng al in oon, Þe Grekis fau?t with hem of þe toun, To gret damage and confusioun Of ouþer party, and aduersite. And in þis while a gret mortalite, Boþe of swerd &amp; of pestylence, Amonge Grekis, by fatal influence Of noyous hete and of corrupt eyr Engendrid was; þat in gret dispeir Of her lyf in þe feld þei leye: For day be day sodeynly þei deye, And her noumbre fast[e] gan discresse. And whan þai sawe þat it nolde cesse, By her avys, þe kyng Agamenoun For a trewe sente to þe toun, For þritty dayes; &amp; Priamus þe kyng, With-oute more, graunted his axyng. Of A wondirful dreme that Andromacha, Ectors wiff, had, which in effect was, that yif here husbonde, the next day ensewynge, went armede to þe felde, that he shulde dy. Where-for she toke here yongeste sowkynge sonne Astromanta, and pitously, on here knees, bysought Ectore to absteyne hym fro þe felde that day. Whan þe Moreyn &amp; þe woful rage Of pestilence be-gan for to swage, And þe trews were wered oute &amp; goon, Þe Grekis cast to mete with her foon, Vp-on a day, in platis armyd clene, Whan Phebus roos, with his bemys shene, Ful plesauntly, &amp; gan to shede his ly?t. But, as I fynd, to-forne þe silfe ny?t, Andronomecha, þe feithful trewe wyf Of worþi Hector, hym lovynge as hir lyf, Be whom he had gete childre two, Wonder semly, and inly fair also— And Lamedonte callyd was þe ton, So ?onge þe toþer, þat hit ne my?t[e] goon, And Astronanta, I rede, þat he hy?t, Fetured wel &amp; passynge fair of si?t; And, as Guydo listeth to endite, Of his moder at þe pappis white, For verray ?ong þat tyme was soukynge, And with his armys hir brestis embrasynge. And she þat ny?t, as made is mencioun, Hadde in hir slepe a wonder visioun, I not, in soth, what I may it nevene, Ouþer a dreme or verraily a sweuene, Or fro a-boue a reuelacioun, —As whilom had þe kyng Scipioun— Or a shewynge, ouþer an oracle, Or of goddis a warnyng be myracle; For, in sothnes, slepynge as she lay, Hir þou?t[e] pleynly, ?if þe next[e] day Hector went his fomen for to assaille, As he was wont, armyd in bataille, Þat he ne shulde eskapen outterly, In fatis hondis to falle finally; And, ouermore, Antropos shal fyne For euer-more his lyues þrede to twyne, And shewe þe force of hir fel[le] my?t, Whan þe parodie of þis worþi kny?t Aprochen shal, with-outen wordis mo, In-to þe feld, pleynly, ?if he go. Of whiche astonyd, streit &amp; short of breþ, Wher as she lay, abreid vp-on þe deþ, And with a si?e stinte for to slepe, And pitously braste oute for to wepe For þe constreint of hir hertly sorwe; And specially on þe woful morwe, Whan þat she sawe þis stok of worþines, As he was wont, manfully him dresse To armyn hym in stele bornyd bri?t, Þis Troyan wal, Hector, þis worþi kny?t, She can no more, but at his fete fil doun, Lowly declarynge hir avisioun, With quakynge herte of verray wommanhede. Where-of, God wote, he toke litil hede, But þer-of hadde indignacioun, Platly affermyng, þat no discrecioun Was to trest in swiche fantasies, In dremys shewid, gladly meynt with lyes, Ful of iapis and illusiouns, Of whiche, pleynly, þe conclusiouns Be nat ellis but folkis to delude, Al-be it so þat [þis] peples rude Þer-in som while han affeccioun To Iuge and deme in her oppinioun Diuersly what þei may pretende, And ofte falle &amp; happen as þei wende, And folweth like, in conclusioun. For drede of whiche, þe lamentacioun Encrese gan of Andronomecha; And in hir swowe first she cried, “a!” Seying, “allas! myn owne lord so dere, ?our trewe wif, allas! whi nyl ?ou here, Whiche of so feithful hool affeccioun Desireth ay ?oure sauacioun!” And vp she roos, deedly of visage, And like a womman cau?t with sodein rage, To kyng Priam &amp; Eccuba þe quene In haste she wente, hir silfe to be-mene, And of hir wyfly hert[e], trewe as stele, Ceriously declarid euerydele, Hir pitous dreme, whiche þoru? myracle To hir only, be devyne oracle, I-shewed was þoru? Goddes puruyaunce; And tolde hem eke þe final ordinaunce Of Fortunes fals disposicioun, Fully purueied to destruccioun Of hir lord, with-oute more delay, In-to þe felde ?if he go þat day. Wherfore, she preieth with a dedly hewe Vn-to þe kyng, of mercy for to rewe, Vp-on hir wo to haue compassioun, For to ordeyne by discrecioun Of his lordship and [of] souereinte, Þat hir lord nat distroyed be Of rekleshede, nor of wilfulnes. And, with þat worde, of verray kyndenes, In whom was ay so moche loue founde, To-fore þe quene aswowne fil to grounde, And seide, “allas!” with a ful pale chere, “Helpe in þis cas, myn owne moder dere, Of wommanhed and routh[e] doþ me grace, Þat my lord in-to þe feld ne pace; And doth ?our deuer, of moderly pite Benignely and goodly for to se To his kny?thod and his hi?e prowes, For to restreyne his renomed noblesse, Þilke day to handle spere nor shelde, Nor þat he go armyd in-to þe felde.” And boþe tweyne assent[e] for þe beste, And condescende vn-to hir requeste, Finally accordynge in-to oon.— Þat whan þe wardis wer redi euerychon, On issinge oute, &amp; Troylus, first of alle, And Paris next, on Grekis for to falle, And after hym þe Troyan Eneas, Kyng Sarpedoun, and Pollydamas, Kyng Eroys, and kyng Epistrophus, And eke þe kyng y-called Forcius, In plate &amp; mail eueryche armed clene;— And alderlaste cam kyng Philomene, With alle þe kynges &amp; lordes of renoun, Þat in diffence comen of þe toun, With þe Grekis kny?tly to debate. And Priamus, sothly, to þe gate Conveied hem, at her oute goyng, And sette her wardes, þis noble worþi kyng, Ful prudently þoru? his sapience, And after ?af hem conge and licence Vp-on Grekis for to kyþe her my?t, Ageyn[e]s whom ful redy for to fi?t Her fomen wern, with royal apparaille, Amyd þe feld abidynge þe bataille. Howe kynge Priamus chargede worthy Ectore that he shulde not go armede to þe felde þat daye. But Priamus, [in] þis mene while, Lyk as Guydo remembriþ in his stile, For þilke fyn, þat ?e han herd me seyn, To worþi Hector repeired is ageyn, Hym contermaundynge þat he ne shold gon Þilke day to fi?t ageyn her foon. For whiche þing, of hi?e dispit he brent, Whan þat he saw oþer lordis went Oute at þe gate, and he allone abood; For whiche he wexe furious &amp; wood, Hooly þe cause arrettynge to his wif, Þat was of cherte so tendir ouer his lyf, Puttinge on hir fully þe occasioun Of his abidynge þat day in þe toun, In preiudise of his worþines And disencresse of his hi?e prowes. And list þoru? tongis to his hi?e estat, Þoru? fals report it were derogat, He caste anoon, of a ful kny?tly herte, For lyf nor deth it shuld him nat asterte With-Inne þe feld þat day to be founde, Þou? it so wer, with many mortal wounde He shulde on pecis hewe be a-soundre, Vp-on þe pleyn dismembrid here &amp; ?onder— So hool in manhod was his hert[e] sette, Þat he anoon, with-oute lenger lette, Ageyn to arme hym was ful dilligent, A-gein þe precepte and commandement Of his fader, &amp; rood forþe [on] his weie. For fer of whiche, as she wolde deie, His wif of newe crie gan &amp; shoute, And with hir pappis also hanging oute, Hir litel childe in hir armys tweyne, A-forn hir lord gan to wepe &amp; pleyne, Besechinge hym, of routhe and pite, ?if he nolde [vn-]to hir sorwe se, At þe leste, for hir wifly trouþe, Þat he of manhod haue in herte rouþe Vp-on hir child and on hir also, Whiche þat she bar in hir armys two, And nat my?t him fro criynge kepe, Whan he sawe his woful moder wepe. And, knelyng doun, vn-to hym she seide, In hir sobbynge as she my?t abreide: “Myn owne lorde haue mercy now on me, And on þis litel child whiche þat ?e se So pitously a-fore ?ou wepe &amp; crye! Haue mercy lord on vs or we deye! Haue mercy eke vp-on þis cyte, Myn owne lorde! haue mercy or þat we By cruel deth passe shal echon, For lak of helpe, allas, whan ?e ar goon!” Þis was þe crie of Andronomecha, With whom was eke hir suster Cassandra, Eccuba, and faire Polycene, And Eleyne, þe lusty freshe quene, Whiche alle attonys fellen hym beforn, With heer vntressid, &amp; wepinge al to-torn, And loude gan to crien in þe place, Besechinge hym, of mercy and of grace, For þilke day to abiden in þe toun, And in his herte to haue compassioun On her compleint &amp; her woful mone, Sith al þe trust of þe toun allone In hym abode, and al þe resistence: For ageyn deth he was her chef diffence; And in hym hooly was her affiaunce, Her sur[e]te, and her suffisaunce, In eche þing þat hem my?t[e] greue. And ?if al þis ne my?t his herte meve For to abide, ?it, of goodlyhede, Þei hym besou?t, to her wommanhede He wolde enclyne his harde herte of stele, Þat þei my?t a litel drope fele Only of pite on her wo to rewe, Þat likly was to moren and renewe Finally to her distruccioun; For of þe cite, sothly, and þe toun, His vnhap were endeles ruyne. But ?it al þis my?t hym nat encline Þat he nold oute, in conclusioun, So indurat, and hertid as lyoun He was alweie, contunynge in his rage; Whos herte my?t asofte nor aswage Nouþer praier nor waymentacioun, Hym to restreyne from his oppinioun: For euery pereil he leide þo a-side, And on his weie gan anoon to ryde; Wher-þoru? his wif noon oþer bote can, But in hir rage to þe kyng she ran, So amased in hir mortal wo Þat she vneþe my?t[e] speke hym to, So diffacid and ruful of hir si?t, Þat by hir hewe knoweþ hir no wi?t: For lost she had boþe my?t &amp; strengþe; And plat she fil to [þe] grounde a-lengþe To-fore þe kyng, þat rouþe was to sene, Besechynge hym, of entent ful clene, Of his grace to consider hir wo: For but he help, Hector was a-go. And he seinge hir faithful wommanhede, At hir requeste rau?t anoon his stede, And priked after, only for hir sake, In so gret haste, þat he haþ ouertake Worþi Hector with-Inne þe cyte, And hent his reyne with gret difficulte, And maugre hym made him tourne ageyn, In swiche wyse, he durst it nat withseyn, Al-be þat he was ful loþe þer-to; So þat by force &amp; praier also, From his stede he made hym a-li?t, Þe areste of whom eschewen he ne my?t, For he ne wolde ageyn his fader striue, Al-be þat he felte his herte rive Of malencolie and of hertly Ire, And of disdeyn newe sette a-fire— So inwardly sterid was his blod, Þat like a tigre or a lyoun wood, Þat wer deprived newly of hir praye, Ri?t so firde he al þat ilke day,— Or liche a bore þat his tusshes whette, While þe Grekis and þei of Troye mette, Furiously walkynge vp and doun. And in diffence, sothly, of þe toun, Troylus first, on his baye stede, Of auenture mette Diomede, And eche at oþer, surquedous of pride, With sharpe speris gan to-gidre ryde; And Guydo seith, with-outen any dred, Oon or boþe had anoon be ded, Nadde Menelay kny?tly go be-twene. And after þat, in a furious tene, He smet his hors, in ful kny?tly wyse, And Meryem, þe my?ty kyng of Frise, Menelaus markid hath ful wel, And with his swerd, ful sharpe ground of stel, Vnhorsid him, and þrewe him on þe grene; For he þe strok my?te nat sustene, Þis Menelay was on him so wood, Þat it was likly, euene þer he stood, With þe lif he shulde nat eskape. For þe Grekis ful hastily hem shape, Þis Meriem, as ?e han herde me seyn, For to be-sette rounde vpon þe pleyn, And to sese hym by þe aventaille, On euery part, and cruelly to assaille, Al destitut in þis dredful cas. But hym to helpe cam Pollydamas With his kny?tes, &amp; gan to nei?en ner Whan he hym sawe take prisoner; And maugre alle þat vppon hym sette, From her hondis Pollydamas him fette, At whos reskus þer was so gret a strif Þat many on þer-fore lost his lyf: For Grekis raþer þan he shulde eskape From her hondis in þat hasti rape, Caste hem pleynly þat he shal be ded, Fully in purpos to haue hadde his hed— He stood of meschef in so gret disioynt. But hym to helpe, euene vppon þe point, Cam Troylus in, most kny?tly of aray, And of his manhod made swiche affray Amongis hem [in] reskus of þis kyng, Þat maugre hem, at his in-comyng Delyuered was þis my?ty lord of Frise From cruel deth, as ?e han herd deuyse. But þer-vppon cam Thelamonivs, Proude in armys, and euere surquedous, With þre þousand, ful worþi euerychon; And he vnhorseth Pollydamas anoon, Among his kny?tes, &amp; proudly bar him doun; But Troylus hath, þoru? his hi?e renoun, Mid of his foon get hym his hors ageyn. But þei of Troye so sore were be-leyn On euery half, þoru? þe Grekis pride, Þat þei [ne] my?t a-forn hem nat abide: For newe and newe þe hardy Achilles Assailled hem with his Mirundones, Þat þei compelled of necessite, In meschef wern maked for to fle Home to þe walles &amp; gates of þe toun, To gret damage and confusioun Of her party þat abak so goon. Of the sorowfule dethe of Margarytone, one of the Basterde sonnes of kenge Priamus. Þe whiche þing, whan Margariton Behilde &amp; sawe how þe game goth, In his herte he gan to wexe wroth, And passingly for to haue disdeyn; And as þe story recordeþ in certeyn, Þat he was boþe hardy &amp; famus, And sone also vn-to kyng Priamus, A noble kny?t, &amp; of gret worþines. And whan he saw þe meschef and distresse Of hem of Troye, &amp; how þei gan to fle, He caste anoon avengid for to be Vp-on Achille, for al his grete my?t, And ran to hym, ful like a manly kny?t, On horse-bak, for þe townys sake, And hym enforseth Achilles to take Amyd þe feld amonge his kny?tes alle. But Achilles—allas, it shulde falle!— Þat day hym slowe, by cruel auenture, Wher-þoru? Troyens my?t[e] not endure Þe felde to hold, but home[-ward] gan hem hi?e, And mortally to make noise &amp; crie: Firste, for þe deth of Margariton, And for þe pursut þat kyng Thelamon Made on þe chaas, þoru? his cruelte, Home to þe gatis of Troye þe cite, Þat slow &amp; kylled alweie as he rood, Al-be þat Paris manly hym wiþ-stood, With his breþre þat in baste wer born. But, for al þat, her ground þei haue lorn, Lefte &amp; forsake outterly þe felde; And home þei went, &amp; brou?t[en] on a shelde Þe dede cors of Margariton; And after þat her gatis shette anon. Þe whiche meschef, as Hector gan be-hold, Of verray Ire his herte gan to colde, And seide, platly, with-oute more delay, He wolde avenge his deth þe same day, And made in haste his stede to be fet, And vp he stirte, &amp; on his basenet— Vnwist þe kyng, or who be lefe or loth— Þer was no geyn—forþe anon he goth, Til he was passid þe gatis of þe toun, More furious þan tigre or lyoun; At whos comynge, þikke as swarm of ben, To-forn his swerd Grekis gonne flen— Þei þou?t it was tyme to with-drawe. And first, I fynde, how þat he hath slawe Two worþi dukes, as he with hem mette, Þat besy wern his weie for to lette:— Þe ton y-called was Eurypalus, And þe toþer hi?te Hascydyus. And so Troyens þe feld ageyn han wonne, And of newe manfully be-gonne Grekis to sue, &amp; folwen on þe chaas. And ?it at meschef daun? Pollydamas Þe same tyme was of Grekis take; But Hector hath so born him for his sake, Where as he sorest was be-leyn, And þoru? his kny?thod reskued him ageyn, And put þe Grekis in so gret distresse, Þoru? his manhod and his worþines, Þat wher-so-euere þilke day he rood, His sharp[e] swerd he baþed in her blood, He was so cruel and so mercyles. But þan a kny?t called Leothydes Shope him anon with Hector for to mete, While he was moste Irous in his hete, And sette on hym ful presumptuously; But Hector þo, deuoyde of al mercy, Anoon hym slow, &amp; þrew hym in þe feld: Þe whiche þing whan Achilles behelde, Þe gret[e] slau?ter and þe woundis wyde Þat Hector made vppon euery syde, He gan anon compassen in his herte, And vp and doun casten and aduerte, How þe Grekis neuer may be sure Ageyn her foon to fi?ten [n]or endure, Nor kepe a felde with hem for to stryve, Al þe while [þat] Hector were a-lyue. Wherfore, he shope &amp; cast[e] many weie, Be what engyne Hector my?t[e] deye, At avauntage ?if he my?t hym fynde; And þer-to eke Polycenes of Ynde, A worþi duke, was also of assent— Only for he of herte &amp; hool entent In hope stood his suster for to wyve, For loue of whom he felt his herte ryve. And in hir grace better for to stonde, He caste fully for to take on honde Þis hi?e emprise, as I haue ?ow tolde. But while þat he was on him most bold, Hector hym slow, þer was non oþer geyn; Þe whiche anoon as Achilles hath seyn, For Ire he wexe in his herte as wood As boor or tigre in her cruel mood, Vp-on Hector avenged for to be; And furiously on hym he gan fle. But Hector kau?t a quarel sharpe [y-]grounde, And þrew at hym, &amp; ?af him swiche a wounde Þoru?-oute [þe] þei?e, vp-on ouþer side, Þat in þe feld he my?t[e] nat abide, But hym withdrow, and anoon is went With his men home vn-to his tent, And made anoon a surgeyn to bynde His mortal wounde; &amp; after, as I fynde, Whan he was staunche, &amp; cesseþ for to blede, In al haste ageyn he toke his stede: And liste he were of þat wounde ded Afterward, as it was gret drede, He þou?t[e] first avengid for to be Vp-on Hector, ?if he my?t hym se, Of hap or sort, ?if it wolde falle: For hym þou?t, to his peynes alle It were [to] hym þe best[e] remedye, Of his honde ?if he my?t[e] dye— For of his lyf he rou?t[e] nat a myte, Be so þat he Hector my?t[e] quyte, Deth for deth, in conclusioun; For þat was hooly his entencioun, Of his desire fully suffisaunce, By deth vnwarly to ?even hym meschaunce. But al þis tyme, Hector, vp &amp; doun, As he was wont, pleieþ þe lyoun Amonge Grekis in many sondri place, And with his swerd gan hem so to enchase, Þat as þe deth, where þei my?t hym sen, Þei fledde a-forn hym like a swarm of ben: For noon so hardy was hym to with-sette. And, in þis while, a Grekysh kyng he mette, Were it of hap or of auenture, Þe whiche, in soth, on his cotearmvre Enbroudid had ful many riche stoon, Þat ?af a li?t, whan þe sonne shoon, Ful bri?t and clere, þat Ioie was to sene: For perlis white and emeraudis grene, Ful many oon, were þere-Inne set, And on þe cercle of his basenet, And rounde enviroun of his aventaille, In velwet fret, al aboue þe maille, Safirs ynde and oþer stonys rede, Of whos array, whan Hector takeþ hede, Towardis hym faste gan hym drawe. And firste, I fynd, how he haþ him slawe; And after þat, by force of his manhede, He rent hym vp a-forn him on his stede, And faste gan wiþ hym for to ride From þe wardis a litel oute a-side, At good leiser, pleynly, ?if he may, To spoillen hym of his riche array, Ful glad &amp; li?t of his newe emprise. But out! allas! on fals couetyse! Whos gredy fret,—þe whiche is gret pite,— In hertis may nat li?tly staunchid be; Þe etyk gnaweþ be so gret distresse, Þat it diffaceth þe hi?e worþines, Ful ofte sythe, of þies conquerours, And of her fame rent aweie þe flours. Desyre of hauynge, in a gredy þou?t, To hi?e noblesse sothly longeth nou?t, No[r] swiche pelfre, spoillynge, nor robberie Apartene to worþi chiualrye: For couetyse and kny?thod, as I lere, In o cheyne may nat be knet y-fere; For kouþe it is, þat ofte swiche ravyne Hath cause ben and rote of þe ruyne Of many worþi—who-so liste take hede— Like as ?e may now of Hector rede, Þat sodeinly was brou?t to his endynge Only for spoillynge of þis riche kyng. For of desire to hym þat he hadde, On horse-bake oute whan he hym ladde, Reklesly, þe story maketh mynde, He cast his shelde at his bak be-hynde, To welde hym silf at more liberte, And for to han opportunyte To spoillen hym, and for no wy?t spare, So þat his brest disarmyd was &amp; bare: Except his platis þer was no diffence Ageyn þe strok to make resistence. Allas, why was he þo so rek[e]les! Þis flour of kny?thod, of manhod per[e]les, Whan þat his fo, al þat ilke day, For hym allone in a-wayt[e] lay, ?if in meschef, of hate and of envie, In þe feld he my?t hym oute espie, Þis Achilles, cruel and venemous, Of hertly hate most malencolyous,— Whiche couertly havynge hym be-side, Whan þat he saw Hector disarmyd ride, He hent a spere, sharpe grounde &amp; kene, And of Ire in his hateful tene, Al vnwarly, or Hector my?t aduerte, (Allas þe whyle!) he smote hym to þe herte, Þoru?-oute þe brest, þat ded he fil doun Vn-to þe erþe, þis Troyan champioun, Þoru? necligence only of his shelde! Þe deth of whom, whan Odemon behelde, Þe worþi kyng my?t hym nat restreyne, But [to] Achilles rood with al his peyne, And hit hym so, myd of al þe pres, Maugre þe my?t of his Mirundones, Þat for ded, Guydo seith certeyn, Of þat wounde he fil gruf on þe pleyn. But his kny?tes on a sheld a-lofte Þei leiden hym, &amp; caried hym ful softe Vn-to his tent, in al þe haste þei can; And þere I leue þis dedly wounded man, Ful sore seke, til he may releue. And after þat, whan it drowe to eve, Þei of Troye, with gret reuerence Dide her labour and her dilligence Þe dede cors to carien in-to toun Of worþi Hector, whan Titan went[e] doun. And to þe temple dolfully þei wende; And of þat day þis was þe woful ende— I can no more—but þus þe longe ny?t In heuynes, as it was skil and ri?t, I wil hem leue, and ageyn returne To my mater to help hem [for] to morne. The lamentacyon of kynge Priamus for the dethe of Ector. But now, allas! how shal I procede In þe story, þat for wo and drede Fele myn hond boþe tremble and quake, O worþi Hector, only for þi sake, Of þi deth I am so loth to write. O who shal now help me to endyte, Or vn-to whom shal I clepe or calle?— Certis to noon of þe mvsis alle, Þat by accorde singen euer in on, Vp-on Pernaso, besiden Elycon, So angelik in her armonye, Þat tonge is noon þat may specefie Þe grete swetnes of her goodly song; For no discorde is founden hem among, In her mvsik þei bene entvnyd so— It syt hem nou?t for to help in wo, Nor with maters þat be with mournynge shent, As tragedies, al to-tore and rent, In compleynynge pitously in rage In þe theatre, with a ded visage— To hem, allas! I clepe dar nor crye, My troubled penne of grace for to guye— Nouþer to Clyo nor Callyope, But to Allecto and Thesyphone, And Megera, þat euere doth compleine, As þei þat lyve euere in wo and peyne Eternally, and in turment dwelle With Cerberus, depe doun in helle, Whom I mote praie to be gracious To my mater, whiche is so furious. For to a whi?t þat is compleynynge, A drery fere is ri?t wel sittynge; And to a mater, meynt with hevynes, Acordeth wel a chere of drerynes To ben allyed, as by vnyte. Wherefore, helpe now, þou woful Nyobe, Som drery ter, in al þi pitous peyne, In-to my penne dolfully to reyne; And helpe also, þou cruel Yxioun, And Belydes, þat doth þe boket gon; And with þi stoon helpe þou, ?e?iphus, And in þi riuer, helpe eke Tantalus, Þat for hunger haste so huge pyne, Þis woful pleint helpe me for to fyne, Me to forthre doth ?oure besynes. For now þe stok and rote of worþines, Of kny?thod grounde, of manhod sours &amp; wel, Þat to-forn alle bare a-weie þe belle Of dorynge do, þis flour of hi?e prowes— And was exaumple also of gentilnes, Þat neuere koude don amys nor seie, Allas, Hector, allas! why shuldestou deie! O cruel Parchas, why toke ?e noon hede, So cruelly to twyne his fatal threde— ?e were to hasty, allas! why were ?e so! And, nam[e]ly, þe þrede to breke a-two, Þou Antropos, þoru? þi grete envie! O Troye, allas! wel maist þou wepe &amp; crie, And make a woful lamentacioun, Whiche hast of newe, to þi confusioun, Loste þi diffence and þi stronge wal, Þi berer vp, þi surete royal, Be whom þin honour chefly was begonne! Allas, allas! for now þi bri?t[e] sonne Eclipsed is, and þou stanst desolat Of al comfort, and discounsolat;— Þi li?t is lost, and þou in dirkenes I-ploungid art: for, in sothfastnes, Of alle worþi, þou hast þe worþiest Þis day y-loste, and þe kny?tlyest Þat is, or was, or shal, I þe ensure, Bene euere born, while þe world may dure! No wonder is þau? þou wepe sore, And day be day compleyne hym euermore, Þat was þi sheld, boþe in Ioie and wo, Whom þou were wont for to loue so, So tendirly with al þin hole herte, Þat it may nat ly?tly þe asterte To haue hym euere in þi remembraunce, Whiche was in soth þi ful suffisaunce. For, as Guydo maketh mencioun, Þer was no man dwellyng in þe toun, Þat he ne had, of verray kyndenes, For loue of hym, as he writ expresse, His child more lef to haue died in þis cas, Ouþer his eyr—so wel be-loued he was— ?if þe goddis, fate, or destyne Disposid had þat it my?t haue be. Wommen also, of euery maner age, Bene for his deth falle in swiche a rage, Þoru? þe cyte, aboute in euery strete, Þat with sobbyng and salt teris wete, And here to-rent for her dedly wo, Furiously ronne to and fro— So mortal was her aduersite, Þat to beholde, allas, it was pite! ?onge maydenes &amp; matrones olde Sobbe and si?e, and her festis folde, And loude crie, and seide fynally: “Allas! now shal oure fadris cruelly In oure si?t be slay[e]n day be day! Allas þe whyle! &amp; no man shal seie nay!— Far-wel oure helpe, now Hector is goon, In [whom] þe surnes of vs euerychon Was wont to reste: now is he ded, allas!” Of whom þe body whan it caried was In-to presence of Priamus þe kyng, Anoon he lost þe offys of spekyng, And gan hym silfe in salt[e] teris drowne, And pitously þer-with fil a-swowne Vp-on þe cors, cold as any stoon, Inly desyrous for to deie anoon Wiþ-oute tariynge, on hym as he lay, But þat he was by force rent awey. His breþeren eke, whan þei token hed, Trist and pale, for sorwe wer ny?e ded, And han hem silfe with rage al to-torn, Þat neuer was, I trowe, seyn a-forn Of breþere ?it swiche anoþer care: For eche of hem with hym silf gan fare As þei wolde haue died on þe cors; For of þeir lif, platly, þei ?af no fors, But at þe grounde with many swo?es sore, Liche wylde bolis þei gan crye and rore, Þat rouþe was her dedly wo to sene— An herte of stele my?t it not sustene. What schal I seyn of Eccuba þe quene, Or his suster, ?onge Pollycene, Or Cassandra, þe prudent and þe wyse, Or of his wyf, þe sorwe to devise? Whiche rent hem silf, in torment &amp; in wo, As finally þei wolde hem silfe for-do By cruel deth, so þei wepe and waille. Þat ?if I shulde make rehersaille, To wryte her sorwes &amp; her compleynynges, Her pitous sobbynge, þrowes, and wepynges, Þe woful cries, &amp; þe pitous sowns, Her drery pleyntis &amp; lamentaciouns, And al her wo for to specifie, A large boke it wolde occupie, ?iffe eche þinge I shulde in order telle— I trowe it were to longe for to dwelle, For any man, and tedius to here. For many day after, as I lere, Þe wommen wepte a-fore þe cors liynge, Hem silfe diffacynge in her compleynynge, Þat wonder was how þei my?t endure, But þat þei han it, sothly, of nature And of kynde for to wepe and pleyne, To si?e sore and in-to teris reyne, Til þe tempeste of her woful rage May be processe lyte &amp; lyte aswage. And þus I leue hem si?e and sorwe make, Þis cely wommen, in her cloþes blake, Shroude her facis, &amp; wympled mourne in veyn, While I turne to my mater ageyn, Howe kynge Priamus made to be wrought an oratory and A College of prestes, in the which was fabricate a Tabernacle, wherin the body of Ector was, in mannys syght, reservide intigrate and hole, with his swerde in his honde, manasshinge the Grekys. To telle pleynly how kyng Priamus In herte was inly desyrous To caste a weie, in his entencioun, Þe cors to kepe from corrupcioun, Whiche naturelly, but men take hede, Corrupte muste, ri?t of verray nede: For, of kyndely disposicioun, Þer may be made noon opposicioun, Aboue þe grounde ?if þe body lie, Þat of resoun it mvt putrefie, But ?if crafte be a-boue nature, Vncorrupte it my?t[e] nat endure. Wherefore, þe kyng shope him to ordeyne To preserue it hool fro þinges tweyne: From odour and abomynacioun, And þer-with eke, by crafty operacioun, Þat it in si?t be not founde horrible, But þat it be lifly and visible To þe eye, as be apparence, Like as it were quyk in existence— What it cost þe kyng wil spare nou?t, But made anoon a-forn hym to be brou?t Þe craftiest maisteres of þe toun, Swiche as hadde moste discrecioun To parforme his axynge coriously. And þei obeie his byddynge feithfully, With al her wille and enter dillygence, In þe temple, moste of reuerence Of al þe toun, whilom dedicat, And of ful ?ore also consecrat To Appollo, of olde fundacioun, Beside a gate stondynge of þe toun, Callyd Tymbria in her Troyan tonge, As in story is boþe red and songe. And in þis phane, þat I spake of here, Þei made firste be þe hi?e auter, By gret devis, a litel oratorie, Perpetuelly to be in memorie, Where was set a riche receptacle Made in maner of a tabernacle, Egal of si?t, for a large ymage, Þat reised was on a riche stage, Þat was born vp at eche of his corneris Of purid golde vp-on foure pilers; And on euerych, ful craftily y-di?t, An angel stood of golde burned bri?t, Coriously þe werke to sustene, With crafty archis, reised wonder clene, Enbowed ouer [al] þe werke to cure— So merueilous was þe celature, Þat al þe rofe and closure enviroun Was of fyn gold, platid vp &amp; doun, Wiþ knottis graue, wonder corious, Fret ful of stonys, riche and precious, Of euery kynde þat man can deuyse, So rially, &amp; in so þrifty wyse, Þat þe dirknes of þe blake ny?t With þe bemys of her clere li?t Enchacid was, where þei dide shyne. And from þe grounde, vp-ri?t as a lyne, Þer wer degres, men by to ascende, Made so wel þat no man koude amende Þe werkemanship; &amp; þei were euerychon Parformyd vp al of cristal stoon, Attenyng vp fro þe table bas Where þe stondyng and þe resting was Of þis riche crafty tabernacle, Havynge a-boue, vp-on eche pynacle, A riche ruby; and reised hi?e on hei?te Stood an ymage, huge &amp; large of wei?te, Of massyf gold, havynge þe liknes Of worþi Hector, þat gan his face dresse Toward Grekis, where he dide stonde, Ay þretynge hem with his swerd on honde. And amyddes al þis grete richesse, Þei han y-set, by good avisenesse, Þe dede cors of þis worþi kny?t, To si?t of man stondynge as vp-ri?t, By sotil crafte, as he were lyvynge, Of face &amp; chere, &amp; of quyk lokynge, And of colour, sothly, and of hewe, Beinge as freshe as any rose newe, And like in al, as be supposaille, As he lyuede in his apparaille: For on his hede, like as it is tolde, Þoru? smale pipes wrou?t &amp; made of gold, Þat be mesour wern enbowed doun To an entre makyd in his crown, Be grete avys and subtylite, To eche party and extremyte Of his body lyneally porrect, Þoru? nerfe &amp; synwe driven &amp; direct, By secre poris craftely to extende, Wherby þe licour my?t[e] doun discende To kepe hym hool fro corrupcioun, With-outen any transmutacioun Of hyde or hewe, in any part to tourne. And at his hede of gold was an ourne, Þat was filde with bawme natural Þat ran þoru? pipes artificial, Þoru? nekke &amp; hed in-to many place, Penytrable by veynes of þe face, Þat þoru? vertu &amp; force of þe lycour He was conserued lifly of colour, Fresche of hewe, quyke, &amp; no þinge pale, So my?tely þe bawme dide avale— Comparysownyd, as it were semblable, To a sowle þat were vegetable, Þe whiche, with-oute sensibilite, Mynystreth lyf in herbe, flour, and tre, And, sembla[b]ly, in-to euery veyne Of þe cors þe vertu dide atteyne, By brest and arme spredynge enviroun: For þe moisture by descencioun To hand and foot, sothly, as I rede, Þoru? bon and Ioynt gan his vertu shede, And distillynge my?tely to flete. And at his feet, ful of gommys swete, A viol stood, temprid with bawme &amp; meynt, Þat be processe may nat wexe feynt, But day be day encresen and amende, Of whiche þe vapour vpward gan ascende, Causynge þe eyr enviroun be delys To resemble a verray paradys: For þe flavour more holsom was &amp; soote Þan þe odour of spice, gomme, or rote. And of pure gold were foure lampis li?t, To-fore þe cors brennynge day and ny?t, With oyle, in soth, ?if it be credible, Þat was be crafte made inextinguyble; For it ne my?t, myn auctor seyth certeyn, Nouþer be queint with tempest, winde, nor reyn, Nor be processe wasten of no ?eris— Whiche in þe eyr be bri?t borned weris Ful craftely reised werne a-lofte, Of whos swetnes men reioyssed ofte, In her corage it likede hem so wel. And whan þis werke was complete euerydel, Rounde enviroun, ful riche &amp; freshe to se, Þei made a parclos al of Eban tre, Þat so longe laste may and dure; Þe whiche tre, only of nature, Whan it is kut smelleþ wonder swete, And may nat waste ne bren[ne] with noon hete, Þou? it be leide amonge þe colis rede, Mid þe flawme of many firy glede— It nat consvmeth, þou? men assaien ofte; And in water it houeth eke alofte, And kyndely to þe grounde it goth, To swymme on hei?te in soth it is so loth. And like also as techeth Pluvius, Þis tre whilom was passingly famus, Of so hy?e pris and reputacioun, Þat in þe large my?ti regioun And worþi lond of Ethiope &amp; Ynde, Of ?ore a-gon, þe folkis, as I fynde, Hadden þis tre in so gret honour, Þat þei ?af tribut to þe emperour, As is remembrid of antyquyte, Of gold and yuor and þis riche tre,— With þese giftes, famous and royal, To quyte her dette to hym in special. And whan Priam, in ful þrifty wyse, Parformed hath, as ?e han herde deuyse, Þis riche werke, noble &amp; excellent, Of hertly loue, in al his beste entent, Ordeyned eke, as Guydo can ?ow telle, A certeyn noumbre of prestis for to dwelle In þe temple, in her deuociouns, Contynuelly, with deuout orisouns, For þe soule of Hector for to preie, Þat þe goddis his spirit list conveie Eternally with hem to dwelle y-fere, In Ioie and blisse, a-boue þe sterris clere. To whiche prestis þe kyng ?af mansiouns, Þer to abide, and possessiouns, Þe whiche he hath to hem amortised Perpetuelly, as ?e han herd deuysed. And whiles þei knele, preie, &amp; wake, I caste fully an ende for to make, Finally of my þridde boke, On my rude maner as I vndirtoke; And whiles þei of Troye wepe &amp; mourne, Vn-to þe Grekis I wil ageyn retourne, And with dul stile on þe story trace, Only born vp with support of ?our grace. [Explicit liber Tercius Incipit liber Quartus]. PART III. BOOKS IV AND V, COMPLETING THE TEXT. BOOK IV. Her bygynneth the fourte boke of Troyee. Howe Kynge Agamenoun and alle the princes of Grece reioyssede the dethe of worthy Ectore, and howe thay sent to Kenge Priamus for to have a trews of two monethes, whil Achilles were made hole of his woundys, and other princes. Hector þus ded, as ?e han herd me seid, And Achilles in his tent I-leied, With his woundis mortal, freshe, &amp; grene, Vp-on a morwe, whan þe sonne shene Enchasid had a-way þe dirke ny?t, Agamenoun, þe wyse worþi kny?t, In his werkis passingly prudent, Hath in al haste for his lordis sent; And whan þei wern assemblid euerychon With-Inne his tent, to hem he seid anoon: “Sirs,” quod he, “and lordis þat ben here, Kynges, princes, and dukis eke yfere, ?if ?e aduerte by clere inspectioun, ?e owe echon with hi?e deuocioun, Hooly of herte oure goddis for to herye, And inwardly for to be ri?t merye, ?if ?e considre and wysly taken hed Þat oure enmy Hector is now ded, Þat whilom was berer-vp of Troye, Her ful[le] trust, her honour and her Ioye, Her hool diffence and protectioun, And vn-to vs deth and confusioun— Vnlikly euere vs to han had victorie Whiles þat he floured in his glorie, Ageyn whos swerd we my?t[e] not availe. For slowe he not at oure aryvaile, ?if ?e remembre, on þe firste day Þe noble kyng callyd Protheselay? And after next, ?if I shal nat feyne, Patroclus he parted euene on tweyne In þe felde amonge vs euerychon: Slowe he nat [eke] þe worþi kyng Menoun, Archilagus, and also Prothenor, And eke þe kyng þat hi?t[e] Alphinor, Phillis also, and Epistrophus? And to his ende he brou?t[e] ?antipus; And Meryon, þe my?ti stronge kyng, In his weie as he cam ridynge He slay[e]n hath, and oþer kynges two, Cedius and Drodius,—also Polycenes and stronge Polybete, Letaboma, and þe kyng Philete, Þe manly kny?t, þe kyng Isydius, And eke þe kyng þat hi?t[e] Hvmerus: For in his Ire and his cruel tene, Of worþi kynges he slayn hath ei?tene, Whiche hider cam oute of Grekes lond, By þe power of his my?ti hond. Now laude and honour to þe goddis alle, Whiche causid han þat it is be-falle Þat he is ded, to oure encres of Ioie, And to discres of oure foon in Troye, As þei shal fynde in experience, And laude also, pris, and reuerence Be to Fortune þat vs hath holp[e] wele With þe turnynge of hir double whele, To hi?e comfort and consolacioun Of vs echon sittynge inviroun, Þat stande now in parfit sikernes Þoru? deth of hym þat dide vs so oppresse. And what may þei now waiten of þe toun But after deth and destructioun, And hastily for to ende in wo, Now þat her trust, Hector, is a-go, With-oute whom þei may not long endure. Wherfore we may fully vs assure Oure purpos hool þat we shal acheve, And finally daunte hem so and greve Þat vn-to hem it shal be importable, Of oon assent ?if we stonde stable: For her party turneth on þe wrak, And her hope is fully put a-bak And dispeired in noon-surete. For outterly þei and her cyte Shal mor &amp; mor in were of deth depende; And we, in soth, shal day be day amende, With helpe of God, boþe on se and lond: For now victorie is redy to oure hond, Voide platly of ambiguyte, And excludid, at eye as ?e may se, Boþe of wantrust &amp; of foreyn drede. But I counsaille, or þat we procede Any ferþer vp-on oure foon to ryde, Prudently a while to abide And kepe vs clos for to passe oure boundis Til Achilles be helid of his woundis, And þan echon, be my?ty violence, Oppresse hem, whan þei haue no diffence, As I haue seide, þoru? helpe of Achilles. And lat [vs] now sendyn for a pes For two monþes to kyng Priamus, ?if it so be he list to graunte it vs, As it is likly, pleinly, þat he shal. And þei þer-while with flawme funeral Consvme may þe dede bodies pale Þat lyen a-brod on euery hil and vale, Whiche by report of hem þat han repeire, Fro day to day infecten so þe eyre, Þoru? þe feld engendringe pestilence, Of stinke þer is so gret a violence; And we þer-while may in ese and reste Oure woundis cure, me semeþ for þe beste.” And þei assent her-to euerychon. And vn-to Troye þe messageres ar goon, And han þe trewe graunted of þe kyng, And be repeired, with-oute more tariyng, And þer-of made ful relacioun To þe Grekis a-fore Agamenoun. And after þat, whan al was at an ende, Home to his tent euery lord doth wende. Howe Kynge Palamydes of newe laborde to haue Agamenoun deposyde of þe governance of þe Grekys. And while þe trewe endureth &amp; þe pes, Amonge Grekis kyng Pallamydes Compleineth sore of Agamenoun, Þat he so hadde domynacioun Aboue hem alle, havyng þer-at envie. And on a day in his malencolie, Of hi?e despit and indignacioun, Ful inly fret with Irous passioun, He gan breke oute, &amp; his rancour shewe By certeyn signes, þou? he spak but fewe. Til on a day wyse Agamenoun Conceyued hath of hi?e discrecioun Hooly þis þing, þou?t he nold[e] spare From point to point him silve to declare, Whan his lordis to-gidre were present, To-forn hem alle in his owne tent, As he þat was (þis noble worþi kynge) Ful circumspect in euery maner þinge— Nou?t to racul nor malencolius, But be atemperance inly vertuous, Wel avised &amp; wonderly prudent. Whan þat he knewe þe menynge &amp; þentent And þe conceit of þis Pallamydes, He nat to hasti nor to rek[e]les, But longe abiding, þoru? prudence &amp; resoun, With-Inne þe boundis of discrecioun— Whos tonge was only of sapience So restreyned þat no necligence Of hasti speche, sothly, for no rape Mi?t make a word his lippes to eskape, Vn-avised for no þing hym asterte, But it were first examynd in his herte; For ay his speche in so þrifty wyse Conveied was, by doctrine of þe wyse, Vnder þe rene of wit and hi?e prudence. And after þat, by forme of elloquence Alweye so seide þat resoun went a-forn, So þat no word was in his tale lorn. And in þis wyse shewynge his sentence To-forn alle in open audience, Seide euene þus, whan þat al was pes, Vn-to þe kyng callid Pallamydes: How Agamenon ful worshipfully replyede agaynste the obieccyons of Palamydes, notwithstondynge he resyngned the Empire of þe Grekes to ther owne eleccyoun, as folowthe. “Sothly,” quod he, “?if ?e taken hede, Me semeth, pleinly, [þat] it were no nede —Avisely ?if ?e list aduerte— To mvse so nor grucchen in ?oure herte, Of al þis hoste þat I haue gouernance— Wisly considered euery circumstaunce, How I þe-stat (whiche no man may denye) Wolde in no maner never occupie By oþer title þan fre elleccioun, Nat interrupt by mediacioun Of brocage, roted vp-on mede, Ay vnder-meynt with fauour or falshede, Depict with colour of trewe entencioun To support swiche false ambicioun:— Of whiche þing here I wil me quyte To-fore ?ow alle, þat I am not to wyte In any wyse of so hi?e offence, But stonde clere in my conscience, With-oute spot of any swiche veyn-glorie Touchinge þestat whiche is transitorie; ?et neuer-þeles, I haue do my cure, With al my wit to helpen &amp; procure Þat euery þing touching þe commovnte Perseuere my?t in prosperite, Havyng þe eye of myn inward si?t Vn-to þe estat of euery maner wy?t Þat were committed to my gouernance, With gret labour and besy attendaunce, Indifferent vn-to hi?e and lowe, To helpe and fostre, wher I coude knowe Þat any stood in meschef or in nede— Day and ny?t for to taken hede, As I best koude, by avisenesse, Ay dillygent þat nat felle in distresse. For, sothfastly, who-so loke a-ri?t, Mi daies þinkyng &amp; my wache a-ni?t, And of myn hert þinly aduertence, With-oute fraude, slouth, or necligence, Was feithfully, with al my ful[le] my?t, Me to aquyte to euery maner wi?t Liche his estat, with-oute excepcioun; So þat no man iustly of resoun, Greke nor oþer þat is now a-lyve, Vn-to my gilt may dew[e]ly ascrive Any falsehed, engyn, or trecherie Of loue or hate, favour or flaterie, In any cause named in special, But þat I haue ben eliche egal To oon and alle, with al my besy peyne, Þat no man hath mater to compleyne For his party, of hi?e nor lowe estat. And to deuoide al rancour and debat Amongis ?ow, I haue do my dever In general þing and particuler, Þat her-toward no þing hath mescheued. And, God wot wel, it shuld[e] nat agrevid To my herte taset at any prys, ?ow tachose by ?oure discret avis Som oþer to þis domynacioun, And I to haue ben in subieccioun With ese of herte and tranquillite Liche oþer lordis here of my degre, And in my wil fully han obeied— Like on of ?ow outterly to haue deyed In þe quarel þat we han vndirtake, ?if destine had it so y-shape, I seie, in soth, me is ful loth to feyne. And ouermore, also, wher ?e pleyne Þat I was chose with-oute ?our assent, Merueileþ nat, sith ?e ne were present; Nor longe after, ?if ?e remembre a-ri?t, Toward Troye ?our weie was nat di?t— ?if ?e considre, it was after ner, Or þat ?e cam, passed ful two ?er: And so longe tabide ?oure commynge, It hadde ben to Grekis gret hyndrynge, Passynge harme, and ful gret damage, And huge lettynge vn-to oure viage. For ?if we had, with-outen any wene, On ?our comynge taried at Athene, It likly is—?e can nat wel seie nay— To haue be þere ?it in-to þis day. And where as ?e, þou? it be nat credible, Affermen eke for an impossible, Þat Grekis shuld in any maner wyse Dor take on hem any gret emprise In ?oure abscence manly to achewe, It is but wynde, no þinge for to leue: For so it be to ?ou noon offence, Þe Grekis han, with-oute ?oure presence, Þoru? her force on water and on lond Ful many þing parformed with her hond, And acheved þoru? her worþines. And of o þing þat in me ?e gesse, Þis to seyne, þat of my degre I shulde in herte so reioisshe me Of þis lordshipe and þis grete estat, Þe more to be pompos and elat In chere or port þat I it occupie— But me to aquite trewly, &amp; nat lye, And to deuoide al suspecioun, I wil make a resignacioun To-fore ?ow alle, for to excuse me. Now beth avised discretly for to se Whom ?e list han ageyn to-morwe prime, With-oute settynge of any lenger tyme, Prolonging forþe, or any more delay.” And þus þei made an ende of þat day, And went her weye only for þat ny?t, Til on þe morwe, þat Titan shadde his li?t, At whiche tyme a conseil general Þe Grekis hilde; but moste in special Of lordis was þer congregacioun, As I haue tolde, for þe eleccioun. And whan þei were al[le] met I-fere, Agamenoun anoon, as ?e shal here, Seide evene þus, with sadde countenaunce: “Lo, sirs,” quod he, “touchynge gouernaunce Þat I haue had, and domynacioun, I haue her-to with hool affeccioun And clene entent do my besynes Þat euery þing mi?t in welfulnes To ?oure encres perseueren and contvne, Recorde I take of God and Fortune, Whiche han conservid, &amp; þe cause be ?ou for to floure in felicite, Þat ?oure honour and [?our] hi?e noblesse Stant hool and sounde ?it in sikirnes. And while ?our fame is most in flouringe, As semeth me, it is ri?t wel sittinge Myne estat fully to resygne, Specially while fortune is benygne; For of so many þat be now present, I am allone insufficient With-oute helpe for to bere þe charge— Men with to moche may ouer-lade a barge, And nam[e]ly in tempest and in rage— And sith ?e bene so discret and sage, Of my berþene late me be releued, So þat no man þer-with be a-grevid; But late vs alle of oon entencioun, With-oute strife or dissencioun, Chesen swiche oon þat be most acceptable To ?ow echon, and most couenable, ?ow to gouerne by discressioun.” And þei echon with hool affeccioun Assentid ben. To speke in general, Here men may se how it is natural Men to delite in þing[e] þat is newe: Þe trust of peple is feint and vntrewe, Ay vndiscrete &amp; ful of doubilnes, And variable of hir sikernesse; Ay awaitynge in her oppinioun After chaunge and transmutacioun, Selde or neuer stondyng hool in oon —To-day þei loue, to-morwe it is gon— In whom ful selde is any sikernes. For only now of newfongilnes Þat hath enbracid her affeccioun, Þei haue in stede of Agamenoun Of newe chose, only of fauour, Pallamydes to ben her gouernour, And of Grece, liche as þei desyre, To haue þe septre of þe hool empire, And to be called, [aboute] in euery cost, Emperour of þe Grekis host, Ri?t as to-forn was Agamenoun. And þis was fyn and conclusioun For þilke day of her parlement. And after þat, euery man is went To his loggynge, home þe ri?t[e] wey. How Achylles grochyde Agayne the eleccyoun Of Pallamydes, concydred þe wysdam of Agamenoun. But in his tent, wounded as he lay, Þe hardy kny?t, þe cruel Achilles, Whan þat he herd of Pallamydes Fro point to point, &amp; of þe elleccioun, He was displesed in his oppinioun, And pleinly þou?t, as to his avys, Agamenoun was passingly more wys And more discret vn-to gouernaunce Þan þe toþer, as to his plesaunce, And seide it was noon eleccioun, But a maner subrogacioun, Be-cause hym silfe in þe parlement At þe chesyng was nat þere present; Arrettinge it passing gret offence Þat þe choys was made in his absence, Wher-with he was of herte inly wroth. But wher so be þat he be lef or loth, Þer is no more; but in conclusioun, In his strengþe stood þe eleccioun. Howe Kynge Pryamus, with al the worthy of Troyans partye, kame to the felde in his owne parsone to revenge the dethe of worthy Ector, And that same day wrought mervaylis with his swerde. The trews passid and y-werid oute, Þe wounded eke recurid al a-boute, Þe nexte morwe after, Priamus In his herte was inly desirous With þe Grekis manly for to fi?t, Hectoris deth tavengen ?if he my?t— Þis olde Priam, kny?tly in þe felde. Þat whan Troyens in hem silf behilde Þe grete wille and þe hi?e corage Of hym þat was so fer ronne in age, Þei gan reioysshe &amp; pluk vp her herte, And specially whan þei gan aduerte His grete manhod and his worþines, His liflyhed and his hie prowes. And for his sake euery maner man Gan armyn hym in al þe hast þei can, With Priamus þat day to lyve or deye. And in-to þe felde þei proudly hym conveie —An hundrid þousand &amp; fyfty of þe toun, Like as Dares maketh mencioun, And worþi kny?tes þei wern euerychon, With-oute oþer þat with Priam goon— And al to-forn went[e] Dephebus, And Parys next, and þanne Priamus, Menon þe kyng, and worþi Eneas, And alderlast cam Pollydamas. And, as I fynde, sterne &amp; ful of pride, Pallamydes cam on þe toþer side In-to þe felde with many stronge bataille. And first whan eche oþer gan assaille, Kyng Priamus kny?tly his weye ches Þoru? þe wardis to Pallamydes, And hym vnhorseth þoru? his hi?e renoun; And lyke a kny?t he kylleþ &amp; bereþ doun Þe proude Grekis, where-so þat he rood— Was noon so hardi þat his swerd abod: For so narwe he gan hem to coharte, Þat her wardis he made a-sondre parte, On hem he was so fel and furious; For he þat day dedis meruelous In armys wrou?t, þat wonder was to sene, And a merueille how he may sustene, Of so gret age, in þe felde tendure; For incredible was, I ?ou ensure, To sen how he, þoru? his grete my?t, Þe Grekis put proudly to þe fli?t. And Dephebus was also nat behynde Ageyn his foon kny?tly, as I fynde, Taquite hym silfe, &amp; make hem to go bak. And Sarpedoun, in whom eke was no lak, I-fallyn is on Neptolonius, Þe proudest Greke, &amp; most surquedous, And most famus as of strengþe &amp; my?t; Þe whiche ageynward rod ful lyn[e] ri?t To Sarpedoun, with a spere rounde, And deliuerly smot hym to þe grounde. But Sarpedoun, ful Irous in his herte, With-oute abode on his fet vp-sterte, And Neptalonye, in his Ire al hoot, Þoru?-out þe þi?e with his swerd he smot. And þanne anon þe kyng of Perce lond, Þat was so worþi &amp; famus of his hond, Of Sarpedoun whan he taketh hede, Kny?tly to hym restorid hath his stede, Nat-with-stondynge þat Menelaus Was vp-on hym passinge dispitous, And with hym eke þe duke of Athenes Enclosid han amonge þe grete pres Þe kyng of Perce—allas! it shulde falle!— And slay[e]n hym, as he amonge hem alle Ful kny?tly fau?t, like a champioun, With multitude enclosid enviroun— And he hym silf but allone, allas! Al destitut in þis mortal cas. Þoru? whos meschef þei of Troye toun Gan to with-drawe; til þat Sarpedoun Hath holpen hem to recure her lond, Ful many Greke kyllyng with his hond. And kyng Priam, so manly founde at al, With his sonys called natural, Which vp-on hym, wher-so þat he rood, Þe longe day manfully abood, Partyng nat, pleynly, fro his syde— And as þe kyng and þei to-gidre ryde, Ful mortally þe Grekis þei confounde; For Priamus, with many cruel wounde, Hath slayn of hem many worþi man, On hors[e]-bak amonge hem as he ran: For þer was noon þat day, ?onge nor olde, Of Troye toun so hardy nor so bolde, Of noon estat, þat haþ so wel him quitte, Amongis Grekis wher-so þat he ritte, Fro point to point to rekne euery þinge, As hath Priam, þe noble worþi kyng. For he allone was confusioun To þe Grekis, and destruccioun, Her outter meschef and discounfeture, A-fore whos face þei my?t[e] not endure; For þinges two, in his mortal Ire, Inwardly setten hym a-fyre: Þe hertly hate þat he bare of old Vn-to Grekis, doublid many fold, With þe deth, had in remembraunce, Of worþi Hector, by contynuaunce, Þe whiche, platly, þoru? his worþines, With his swerd he shope hym to redresse. For fret of hate &amp; constreint of his peyne Wer verraily þilke þinges tweyne By whiche þat day, who-so loke a-ri?t, His force was doublid, and his my?t. Where-þoru? he toke so cruel hi?e vengaunce, Þat he þe Grekis brou?te to outtraunce, And þoru? his kny?thod put hem to þe fli?t. But Grekis þan attonys dide her my?t, By assent to assemblen in-to on; And for a slei?te a-syden oute þei gon In-to a plein, large &amp; fair to se, Betwene Priam and Troye þe cite, To fyn only in her entencioun Hym to debarre þe entre of þe toun: For euery weie þe Grekis han with-set, Þat þei of Troye hadde þo be let At her repeire, þe stori telleþ þus, Nadde þe manhod ben of Priamus, Þe whiche anon, as eny lyoun stronge, With his swerd gan riden hem amonge, And seuered hem, with large woundis wyde, And slowe al þo þat wold his swerd abide, Euery-where, endelonge þe pleyn. And Paris eke hath hem so be-leyn With my?ti shot of his stronge archeris, And with þe pursut of his arblasteris, Þat þei ne my?t of þe shot so kene Þe mortal harme abide nor sustene, But gan anoon [to] flen oute of þe place. And kyng Priam so narwe gan hem chace, Þat of nede and necessite, Þoru? þe slau?ter and þe cruelte Of his swerd, sharpe whet &amp; grounde, Þer was no Greke in þe feld y-founde But fled aweye, eueryche to his tent; And þei of Troye be to her cite went Be-cause it drowe fast[e] toward ny?t, For Phebus had be-reved hem his li?t. And so þe honour of þis hi?e victorie, Þe worship eke, þe laude &amp; memorie, Perpetuelly, and þe palme also Priam þe kyng hath wonnen &amp; no mo For þilke day, in reles of his sorwe. Howe Priamus sent to þe Grekes for a trewe, &amp; in þe mene tyme ordeynd þe Cors of þe Kenge of Perce to be burede. And, as I rede, on þe next[e] morwe He hath y-sent oute of Troye toun For a trew to Agamenoun, Whiche granted was þe silve day at prime, —Al-be þer-of rehersid be no tyme How longe it last, in þe boke expresse— Duryng þe whiche þei dide her besynes, Hertly labour, and inward dilligence For to ordeyne with gret[e] reuerence How þat þe cors of þe worþi kyng Of Perce lond, with-oute more tariyng, With kyngly honour oute of Troye toun Shal caried ben in-to his regioun To be buried with his predessessours, With oþer kynges, his progenitours. Þe whiche þing was complet be þavis Of Alysaunder, þat called was Parys. And first þe cors, enbawmed richely, Conveied was ful sollempnely, As writ Guydo, with an huge route Of his kny?tes rydyng him aboute, Trist and hevy, clad in blak echon. And with þe char þe ri?t[e] weie þei gon Toward Perce, ledyng of þis kyng Þe dede cors toward his buriyng, Whiche halwed was, lyche his estat royal. And in þis while þe fest[e] funeral Was holde also with gret deuocioun Of worþi Hector with-Inne Troye toun, Liche þe custom vsed in þo dawes And þe ritys of her paynym lawes. Þe whiche fest, as made is mencioun, Fro ?er to ?er by reuolucioun I-halwed was þe space of fourte-ny?t, With many flawme and many hydous li?t Þat brent enviroun in þe seintuarye, And called was þe Anyuersarye, For þat it cam aboute ?er by ?er A certeyn day in her kalender. In whiche of custom for a remembraunce Þe peple shulde by contunvance Pleyne and wepe, &amp; also preie and rede For her frendis þat a-forn were dede, Ful pitously with her heer [to-]torn, Mornyng in blak &amp; knelynge ay a-forn Þe dede cors of þis worþi kny?t, Whiche in his tyme passing was of my?t. And þis was doon while þe trew[e]s dure, So þat Grekis trustly my?t assure Whan þat hem list, at good liberte, With-oute daunger entre þe cyte Day be day; and Troyens my?t also Vn-to þe Grekis frely come and go. At whiche tyme, with ful gret delyt, Hath Achilles cau?t an appetit To entre and se þe maner of þe toun, With-oute wisdam or discrecioun, For to behold, pleinly, and to se Hooly þe maner of þis solempnyte. How Achilles first, in the Tempele of Apollo, was smyte with Cupidys darte, in lovynge of Polycyne. And forþe he went on a certein day Toward Troye, in al þe hast he may, Vnarmyd, soth[ly], as myn auctor seith, With-oute assuraunce or any oþer feith Excepte þe trew, who-so be lefe or loth. And first of al to þe temple he goth Of Appollo: halwed was þe feste Þoru?-oute þe toun, doun vn-to þe lest, Þat clepid was þe Anyuersarie, As ?e han herde,—what shuld I lenger tarie?— And many worþi present was þer-at, Amyd þe temple, of hi?e and lowe estat— Lordis and ladyes, of affeccioun, From euery part gadred of þe toun. Now was the cors of þis worþi knyþt As freshe of colour kepte vn-to þe si?t, As lifly eke, and as quik of hewe To be-holde as any rose newe, Þoru? vertu only of þe gommys swete And þe bawme þat gan aboute flete To euery Ioynt and eche extremyte. And at þis feste and solempnyte Was Eccuba and ?onge Polycene, So wommanly and goodly on to sene, With many oþer of hi?e estat and lowe, To-fore þe cors sittynge on a rowe With heer vntressid, clad in wedis blake, Þat euere in on swich a sorwe make Þat routh[e] was and pite for to sene How þei pleyne &amp; þe deth be-mene Of worþi Hector, of kny?thod grounde &amp; welle. But trowe ?e (as Guydo list to telle) Þat Polycene, in al hir woful rage I-chaungid hath vp-on hir visage Hir natif colour, as fresche to þe si?t As is þe rose or þe lillye whi?t? Ouþer þe freshenes of hir lippes rede, For al þe terys þat she gan to shede On hir chekis, as any cristal clere?— Hir heer also, resemblyng to gold wyre, Whiche lay abrood like vn-to þe si?t [Of] Phebus bemys in his spere bri?t, When he to vs doth his li?t avale. And ay she rent with hir fyngeris smale Hir golden here on hir blake wede, Of whiche þing Achilles toke good hede, And gan merueille gretly in his þou?t How God or Kynde euer my?t haue wrou?t In her werkis so fair a creature: For he þou?t he my?t[e] nat endure To beholde þe bri?tnes of hir face; For he felt þoru? his herte pace Þe percyng stremys of hir eyen two, Cupides brond hath hym markid so, For loue of hir, þat in his desire He brent as hoote, in soth, as any fire, And after sone with sodeyn colde he quoke, And alweye fix on hir he hadde his loke, So þat þe arwe of þe god Cupide Percid hym evene þoru? þe syde To þe herte, &amp; ?af hym swiche a wounde Þat neuere was lykly for to sounde. And ay in oon his loke on hir he caste, As he durste, and gan to presse faste Toward hir, namly, with his eye, Þat hym þou?t he most nedis deye, But ?if þat he founde in hir some grace— Þer was no geyn: for pleinly in þat place Of newe he was kau?t in lovis snare, Þat of helth and of al welfare He was dispeired in his herte so, Þat he ne knew what was best to do. Eche oþer þing, I do ?ow wel assure, He set at nou?t, and toke of hit no cure; His þou?t was hool on hir &amp; on no mo; Þe longe day þus went he to and fro, Til Phebus char lowe gan declyne His golden axtre, þat so cler doth shine, —Þis to seyne, þe sonne went[e] doun— Whan Eccuba, quene of Troye toun, And hir dau?ter Pollycene, also, Oute of þe temple to þe paleis go; And ay Achilles on hir hadde a si?t While he my?t, til for lak of li?t He may no more haue leyser oportune To loke on hir, cursed be fortune. Achilles, in the syght of Polycene, kaght his dethe, and so went oute of þe Tempyle to his Tente. For whiche in haste he makid haþe his went With his kny?tes home vn-to his tent, Wher he anon, with-oute more tariyng, To bedde goth, ful trist in compleyning, Ay in hym silf casting vp and doun, In his mynde, and eke in his resoun, From hed to foot hir bewte euerydel. And in his hert he felt &amp; knewe ful wel Þat final cause of his languysshinge Was Polycene, of bewte most passinge: For loue of whom so moche peine he felte, Þat with þe hete he þou?t his hert[e] melte— Ay on his bedde walwyng to &amp; fro For þe constreint of his hidde wo, For whiche almost him þou?t[e] þat he deide, And to him silfe even þus he seide: “Allas,” quod he, “how me is wo be-goon, Þat of my sorwe know[e] ende noon; For I suppose, sith þe world be-gan Ne was þer neuere a wofuller man: For I þat whilom was of so gret my?t, So renomed of euery maner wy?t Þoru?-oute þe world, boþe of hi?e &amp; lowe— For þer was noon, in soþe, þat koude knowe A man in armys þat was more famus, Nor I-holde more victorius, To-fore þis tyme remembrid be no stile In-to þis day—allas, þe harde while!— Nouþer Hector, pleinly, nor noon oþer, Of Polycene þat was þe worþi broþer, Þat power had whan þei with me mette, For al her my?t, me to ouer-sette, Nor in þe felde my force for to daunte, Here priuely as I me dar avaunte! But now, allas, a mayde of tender age Hath sodeinly me brou?t in swiche a rage, Þat with þe stremys of hir eyen tweyne She percid hath and corve[n] euery veyne Of myn hert, þat I may nat asterte For to be ded, þoru? constreint of my smerte! For who shal now wissen me or teche, Or who, allas, shal now be my leche, Or who shal now helpe me or saue?— Þer is but deth, and after þat my graue, For oþer hope, pleinly, is þer noon Saue in hir mercy, allas, &amp; þat is goon!— For nouþer prayer, tresour, nor richesse, Force nor my?t, nouþer hi?e prowesse, Hi?nes of blood, birþe nor kynrede May availle [n]or helpen in þis nede To meven hir, nor my sadde trouþe, Vp-on my wo euere to haue rouþe! What newe furie or importune rage Hath brought myn herte in-to swyche outrage, Ageyn[e]s whiche I can not debate— To loue hir best þat dedly doth me hate!— And, in good feith, who wisly list aduerte, Litel wonder þou? she me hate of herte, Sith I am come hyder fro so ferre On hir kynrede for to make werre, In þe whiche, to my confusioun, Hir kny?tly broþer, most worþi of renoun, Haue fatally with myn hondis slawe, Whiche in þis worlde had[de] no felawe Of worþinesse nor of manlyhede! Allas! allas! now may I quake and drede, And of my lyf fallen in dispeire: For how shuld I be bold to haue repeire, Or dorn, allas, comen in hir si?t?— I woful wreche! I vnhappy wy?t! Or how shal I ben hardy to appere In þe presence of hir eyen clere? Certys, I se non oþer mene weye But finally þat I must[e] deye— So dispeired I stonde on euery syde, Of oþer helpe I can me nat prouyde.” And ri?t anoon, with profounde si?es depe, Þis Achilles brast oute for to wepe, With dedly chere, pale and funeral, And with his face turned to þe wal, Þat rouþe was and pite for to sene Þe hertly furie of his peynes kene. For so oppressed he was in his þou?t, Of lyf nor deth þat he rou?t[e] nou?t; And þis contvneth til it drow to ny?t, Þat Titan haþ withdrawe his clere li?t. Howe Achilles sent his messanger to quene Eccuba for to have Polycene: wherfor he wolde set þe Troyans and þe Grekes at finale pece. And euere in oon lith þis woful man I-liche sike, of colour pale and wan, With-oute slepe, so fretyng was his sorwe, Til Lucifer, on þe nexte morwe, To-fore þe sonne, with his bemys clere, Ful lustely gan for to appere In þe orient, whan þis Achilles, Vnpacient, with-oute reste or pes, Quakynge euere in his feuere newe, As it was sene, pleinly, in his hewe— Til he abreide of anguysshe sodeynly, And called oon þat was with hym prevy, And of counseil whom he tristeþ wel; And vn-to hym he telleþ euerydel From point to point with him how it stood, And sent him forþe, be-cause he koude his god, On his message strei?t to Troye toun With ful avis and informacioun Of þis mater to Eccuba þe quene, Þoru? his wisdam for to ben a mene, ?if he my?t, by his discrecioun, Fynde any waye of sauacioun Vn-to his lord, þat he louyd so. And to þe quene anon he is go, And his mater wysly gan conveie To-forn or he of grace wolde preie Þat she enioieth to ?eue hym audience: For in his tale þer was noon offence— He was no fool, nor newe for to lere. Wherfore, þe quene goodly gan hym here Of al þat euere hym likeþ for to seyn— Þer was no worde y-lost nor spoke in veyn, For his tale no man koude amende. [And] Craftely he gan to discende To þe substaunce, and tolde clerly out, With premisses ful wel brou?t about, Þat finally, in conclusioun, Þe chefe, he seide, of his entencioun, Effectuelly, ?if it wolde be, Was for to make pes and vnite Atwene Grekis &amp; þe folke of Troye, To whiche þing he knew no better woye Þan of þe werre, for her alder ese, By his wit prudently tapese Þe mortal strife and þe bitter rage By allyaunce only of mariage, ?if þat hir liste, þis wyse, worþi quene, Þat hir dou?ter, faire Pollycene, May weddid be vn-to Achilles, Wher-þoru? þer my?t be a final pes— ?if Eccuba, by hir discresioun, Þoru? hir wit and mediacioun, And hir prudence my?t aboute brynge Þat Priamus were fully assentynge, Þat Achilles my?t his dou?ter wyve, So þat it my?t parformyd ben as blyue (Lyke as I haue made mencioun), By couenaunt only, and condicioun Þat þe Grekis shal her werre lete, And suffre him to lyuen in quyete— ?if þe mariage of þis ilke tweyne Parformed be, and knyt up in a cheyne. Of the answere of Eccuba, and howe she exortede Kynge Pryamus to þe same entent. And whan þe quene hath knowen his entent, Ful sobirly, by good avysement, To-forn or þat any word asterte, Ful pitously she sy?ed in hir herte; And, at þe laste, with a sobir chere, She seide þus to þe messager: “My frend,” quod she, “touching þi request, I can no more make þe beheste, But at þe leste I wil condiscende What lyth in me to bringe to an ende Þi lordis wil, with al myn herte entere. But here-vp-on, I muste firste requere Þe kynges wil, ?if he wil ?eue assent To þe purpos [for] whiche þou art sent; And, ouermore, I muste wyte also ?if þat Parys be willyng eke þer-to— Of whiche þing, with euery circumstaunce, I wil my silfe maken enqueraunce Ful feithfully of Priam and Parys, Þe mene whyle, what is her avys, With-oute more, with-Inne dayes þre, At whiche tyme come ageyn to me From Achilles, ?if he wil þe sende, And finally þou shalt knowe an ende Of þis mater, and an answere pleyn.” And home he goth to Achilles ageyn With ful glad chere, his lord þe mor to plese; And for to sette his hert[e] bet at ese, Avisely, of hi?e discrecioun, He hath so made his relacioun, And told his tale in so þrifti wyse, As he þat koude his wordis so deuyse To bringe in hope [in-]to his lordis herte, With ful reles of his peynes smert, Wher-by he made his sorwe to withdrawe. And þus while hope gan [for] to a-dawe Amyd his brest, Eccuba þe quene To Priam spak of þis Polycene, Touchinge þe sonde of þis Achilles, And of his profre for to make a pes— She tolde hym al, &amp; for-gat no þinge. Howe Priamus disclosyde the privite of his conseyte and gruchinge to be allyed with Achilles. Wher-of astonyd, Priamus þe kyng Spak nat a word half an oures space, But in hym silfe gan for to compasse Ful prudently what it my?t[e] mene, Þat Achilles wolde haue Polycene Vn-to his wyf, ay wondring mor &amp; more; And at þe last, si?ynge wonder sore, He discloseth þe conceit of his herte, And seide, “allas! how sore it doth me smerte To remembre þat I may haue no pes— Þe grete offence of þis Achilles Towardis me, pleinly, whan þat he Slowe worþi Hector, þoru his cruelte, Þat hooly was vp-on euery side Þassuraunce, gouernour, and guyde Of me and myn, platly, for to seyne, And, þer-with-al, of myn eyen tweyne He was allone þe verray sothfast ly?t, Shelde &amp; protectour þoru? his gret[e] my?t And his manhod ageyn þe mortal rage Of Grekis werre in my croked age! But now, allas, to my confusioun He slawen is, so worþi of renoun, Be Achilles, whiche may not out of mynde— Þat in myn hert I can neuere fynde To ben allyed with my mortal foo, Rote &amp; grounde of al my sorwe &amp; wo! It were ful harde myn hert[e] to apese To loven hym þat causeþ myn vnese On euery half, wher-þoru? my cruel foon, Þe proude Grekis, hertid ben echon Ageyn[e]s me, now fortune is contrarie, Torned of newe my quarel to apaire— Þat causeth Grekis, wood and furious, On me, allas, to be presumptuous, Only for Hector is me berafte away. But sithen I noon oþer chese may, Ageyn[e]s herte, þou? it for anger ryve, In þis mater assay I shal to strive, Þou? me be loth, &amp; sitteth me ful sore— ?it to eschewe harmys þat ben more, Whiche likly ben here-after for to falle, And for to saue myn oþer sonys alle, I wil concent þat þis Achilles, So þat he make a trewe final pes Atwene Grekis and also þis cite, With-oute more, pleinly, how þat he Haue vn-to wyfe my dou?ter Polycene. But list þat he any tresoun mene, My wil is, first, how-so þat it wende, Of his beheste þat he make an ende, Wiþ-oute fraude: þis is myn avis.” To whiche conseil assenteth eke Parys, And more rathe, in conclusioun, For þer was made noon excepcioun In þis trete of þe quene Eleyne, Þat Menelaye euere shulde atteyne Hir to recure ageyn vn-to his wyf— For whiche Paris, with-oute noise or strife, Or grucchinge ouþer, vn-to þis entent With-Inne hym silf was fully of assent, Þer-by hopynge, with-oute fere or drede, Perpetuelly Eleyn[e] to possede Ri?t at his lust, &amp; no man shal seie nay. And after þis, vppon þe þrid[de] day Achilles hath, to wyte of þis mater, To Eccuba sent his Messanger; And she tolde hym þe answere of þe kyng, Ceriously gynnynge and endynge, And how þat he assenteth wel þer-to, And Paris eke, &amp; she hir silfe also, ?if it so were, pleynly, she hym tolde, Touchinge þe pes þat þe purpos holde, And firste þat he his heste bring aboute Þat þei be sure: þanne him dar not doute Þat he shal haue his purpos euerydel, ?if þat he wirke prudently and wel. And here-vp-on, with informacioun Þis messanger, oute of Troye toun, With-oute abood, in al þe haste he may, To Achilles helde þe ri?t[e] way, And tolde him hool þeffect of þis mater. And he alweie feruent and entere, In herte brent hoot as any glede, And saw þer was no waye for to spede But only pes, as ?e han herd me telle; And ay his brest with si?es gan to swelle For þe loue of þis Polycene, And cast a[l]way, a-monge his peines kene, To his purpos a weie for to fynde. And whiles he was besy in his mynde How he shuld his purpos bringe a-boute, And in hym silf cast[e] many a doute, Anoon Dispeir in a rage vp-sterte And cruelly cau?te hym by þe herte, Whiche hath hym þrowe in-to swiche a were, Þat hym þou?te it nas in his power His beheste to fulfille in dede, Excepte he hadde wel þe lasse drede Euery þing to putte[n] in certeyn, Wenyng no Greke wolde his lust withseyn, From his desire to be variable. And to hym silf þus was he fauourable For to parforme, and no þing denye— Al þat was lusty to his fantasye— As is þe maner of louers euerychon, Þat þei suppose to acheue anon What þing it be þat þei take on honde, In what disioint þat þe mater stonde, Al-þei? it be a verray impossible— In her foly þei ben [ay] so credible. And so Achilles trusteth finally To fulfille his hestes outterly, Supposyng ay, for his worþines, For his manhod and his hi?e prowes, In whiche he dide hym silfe glorifie Somwhat of pride and of surquedie, How þe Grekis shulde be dispeired Boþe of her trust &amp; her my?t apeired, Vp-on Troyens to wynnen any londe, ?if it so were he with-drowe his honde To helpen hem, and þer-with-al also Home in-to Grece þat þei wolde go From þe sege, only for his sake, And her quarel outterly forsake,— But it so were þis hardy ferse Achille With hem abood þe cite for to spille. For whiche þing þe lordis by assent Assemblid wern to heren þe entent Amonge hem alle of þis Achilles, By þe biddynge of Pallamydes. Howe Achilles, for the love of Polycene, exortede instantly the Grekis for to take A parpetuale pece with the Troyans, þe which pece he mevyde by many a sotele mene. And whan þei wern gadrid alle I-fere, To-forn hem alle, like as ?e shal here, Þis Achilles hath his tale gonne, And seide: “sirs, þat so moche konne Boþe of wisdam and of hi?e prudence, So renomed eke of sapience Þoru?-oute þe worlde, and of discrecioun, And ben so worþi also of renoun, Kynges, dukis, of whom þe rial name From est to west floureþ ?it þe fame, Boþe of kny?thod and of manlihede, To þat I seie, I praye ?ou takeþ hede: Þis to seyne, ?if þat ?e considere Þe pleyn entent of oure comynge hider, By good avis and discrecioun, Had no grounde founded on resoun Nor cause roted on no titel of ri?t, ?if it so be, þat ?e lifte vp ?oure si?t And aduerten clerly in ?oure mynde: Ful fer abak wit was sette be-hynde, Prudent lokynge, and avisenesse; For first whan we, of foly hastynesse, Toke vp-on vs to come fro so ferre Ageyn[e]s Troyens for to gynne a werre, And to iuparde oure lyves euerychon For þe loue of o man allone— ?e weten alle, I trow[e], whom I mene: Kynge Menelay, defrauded of his quene— To telle trouþe, me list nat for to feyne; For ?e wel wite, only þat Eleyne Was grounde &amp; gynnynge of al þis debate, For whom so many worþi of estate, Recurles of any remedye, Life and good han putte in iupartie— Oure londis left and oure regiouns, Oure cites eke &amp; oure riche tounes, Whiche by oure absence stond[e] desolat— Wives and childer eke disconsolat, In wo abide, mournynge, &amp; distresse, Whiles þat we, þe sothe to expresse, Fro day to day, be-set on euery syde, Lyn in þe felde, and oure deth abide In sorwe &amp; care, in labour and in wo. And, with al þis, ?e wete wel also, Siþen tyme þat þe werre be-gan, Of oure Grekis how many worþi man Hath loste his lyf þoru? deþis fatal wounde, Þat my?t her-to haue lyued &amp; be sounde At home in Grece assured wel in Ioye, ?if þei ne hadde comen vn-to Troye— Þat to remembre it is ful gret pite. And, ouer þis, I seie also for me, Amonge Troyens in her cruel mood, I haue y-lost so moche of my blood, Þat hath ful ofte made me pale of hewe;— Þis oþer day, also, grene and newe, I hadde of Hector swiche a mortal wounde, With a quarel sharpe whet &amp; grounde, Aboue þe þi?e, so kene was þe hed —Þe same day a-forn þat he was ded, Of verray hap as it was y-shape,— Þat fro þe deth vnneþe I my?te eskape. Whiche [?it] al freshe is vppon me sene, Large and wyde, and as ?it but grene, Þe smert of whiche sore ?it I pleyne. And, in good feith, me semeth þat Eleyne, ?if ?e aduerte wysly in ?our þou?t, With swiche a pris shuld[e] nat be bou?t, Wher-þoru? oure lyf and oure good y-fere, And oure honour arn y-put in were, And dredfully hangen in ballaunce. For ?if þat ?e in ?oure remembraunce Conceyve a-ri?t and cast[en] vp &amp; doun Þe sodeyn chaunge and reuolucioun Þat fallen hath sith þe werre gan, Þe slau?ter &amp; deth of many worþi man Þat for hir sake hath here lost his lyf,— ?et þe werst of þis mortal strif Doth most rebounde [in-]to oure damage, To disencres and eke disavauntage, And likly is to encrese more ?if ordynaunce be nat made þer-fore, And remedie shape on ouþer side, By fyn only þat Eleyne abide With hem of Troye, stille here in þe toun. And late vs cast, by good inspeccioun, For oure ese som oþer mene way, So þat þe kyng called Menelay Chese hym a wyf in som oþer lond, Lyk his estat be suraunce or be bonde, Vnder wedlok confermed vp of newe, Þat vn-to hym wole be founde trewe, Siþen þat he, with-oute gilte or synne, May be þe law from Eleyn[e] twynne: For of dyvos causis ben y-nowe, Þoru?-oute þe worlde of euery wi?t [I-]knowe, Of avoutri for þe foule vice. For to lawe is no preiudice, Þou? Menelay iustly hir for-sake, Whan so hym list, and anoþer take Þat shal him bet boþe queme &amp; plese. And so to vs it shal be ful gret ese, Whan þe werre is brou?t to an ende, Whiche likly is many man to shende, ?if it so be þat it forþe contvne. Þe grete labour is so inportune, Þat we ne shal no while mowe sustene: For þis is soth, with-outen any wene, Troyens ?it ben flourynge in her my?t, And with hem han ful many worþi kny?t To helpen hem, of hi?e &amp; lowe degre; And þer-with-al, so stronge is her cyte On euery parte, with-outen &amp; with-Inne, Þat we ar nat likly for to wynne In oure purpos, þou? we euere abide. Wherfore, be wisdam lete vs voide pride And wilfulnes, only of prudence To han þe eye of oure aduertence To oure profyt more þan to veyn-glorie, And while oure honour shyneþ by victorie, A wysdam is to withdrawe oure hond, Sith we may nat constreyne by no bond Fortunys whele for to abide stable. Wherfor, I rede, or she be mutable, Þis gery goddes with hir double cher, Lat vs ?eve vp swiche þing as liþe in wer Whiles þat we mow oure worship saue: For of þe werre þe laude ?it we haue, Considered wel how by oure manlyhede Oure most[e] fo, Hector, is now dede; And while þat we in oure honour floure, My counseil is, or Fortune loure, As I seide er, to chaunge hir bri?t[e] face, While þat best we stonde in hir grace, By on assent and oon oppinioun, With-outen any contradiccioun, Of hert &amp; wil, boþe of on and alle, Or oure honour on any party palle, In-to Grece þat we home retourne. For ?if þat we lenger here soiourne On þe quarel þat we haue longe swed, Dout[e]les—it may nat bene eschewed— Ful gret damage—þis with-oute faile— Or we haue don, shal folwen at þe taile, Wherfore, best is oure foly vp resigne. And while oure hap is welful &amp; benygne, Most blaundisshinge, and of face faire, Þe tyme is best to maken oure repeire, While þat we stonde, in party &amp; in al, With oure enemyes in honour perigal And fer aboue, pleinly, ?if þat we Koude han an eye to oure felicite, While þat is in his ascenceoun. But list som man wil make obieccioun Þat we may nat [so] oure honour saue, To repeire, pleynly, but we haue Eleyne ageyn, þat is cause of al:— To whiche þing anoon answer I shal, ?if any man in his fantasie, To dishonour or to vyllenye Arrette wolde, in any maner kynde, We to gon hom &amp; leven hir be-hynde, Shortly to seyn, I holde it be no shame, Sith þat we han on as gret of name As is Eleyne, and of berthe as good, Amongis vs y-come of kynges blood, Suster to Priam, lord of Troye toun, Exyona, whom þat Thelamoun In kepyng haþ, ?if I shal nat feyne, In Troye toun as Paris haþ Eleyne. And sithe now it may bene noon oþer, Lete þe ton be sette ageyn þe toþer; And þe surplus of olde enmyte Betwyxen vs and Troye þe cite, My conseil is, for oure boþen ese, By on assent wysly to appese— Þis al and som—&amp; þat we hen[ne]s wende. I can no more; my tale is at an ende.” Howe Kynge Menelaus, Heleyn-is husbonde, replyede agayns the exortacyons of Achilles. To whom anoon kyng Menelaus, For verray Ire wood and furious, And kyng Thoas, þe duke eke of Athene, As þei þat my?t no lenger hym sustene, —To suffren hym þei were so rek[e]les— Spak alle attonis vn-to Achilles, Nat only þei, but, þoru? inpacience, Þe court parturbid, with-oute prouidence With tumult gonne to repreue Þis Achilles, and proudly hem commeve Ageyn[e]s hym and hys oppinioun. And seide shortly, in conclusioun, Vn-to his reed þei nold[e] neuere assent Nor condescende to no þing þat he ment, To be gouerned by hym in þis cas! For whiche þing anoon Achilles was So full of Ire and rancour in his hert, Þat sodeinly from his se he sterte, And went his way, as he were in a rage, Triste and pale, and a wood visage, And shortly seide, for hym list nat feyne, Þat he ne wolde lenger don his peyne To helpen hem, how-so þat þei spede, Ageyn[e]s Troyens, for no maner nede; And bad anon, þis hardy Achilles, To his kny?tes, called Mirundones, Þat þei no more with spere nor with shelde To helpe Grekis entren in-to felde, But kepe hem clos at home with-Inne her tent. Þus in his Ire he ?af commaundement To alle his men, as ?e han herd deuise, Hem to withdrawe at euery hy?e emprise, Whan-so-euere þei goon in-to bataille. And in þis while skarsenes of vitaille Fil in þe hoste of fleshe, bred, &amp; wyn, Þat many Greke brou?t vn-to his fyn; For þei ne my?t endure for distresse, Constreint of hunger dide hem so oppresse, Til at the last kyng Pallamydes, As he þat was in no þing rek[e]les, Hath þer-vp-on maked purviaunce, Remedie, and redy ordinaunce. And by assent &amp; counseil of echon, He haþ y-sent wyse Agamenoun, Þe worþi kyng, to Messa þere beside, A litel Ile, only to prouide For þe Grekis, ?if he my?t[e] spede Hem to releue in þis grete nede. And Thelephus, kyng of þilke lond, Of gentilnes hath put to his hond, As he þat was large &amp; wonder fre, And renomyd of humanite, To socour hem, commaundinge anoon His puruyours in al haste to goon From euery party abouten enviroun Þoru? alle þe boundis of his regioun, And feithfully to cerchyn euery coste To take up vitaille for þe Grekis host. And after þat, ful hastely he made To stuffe her shippes, pleinly, &amp; to lade With euery þing þat was necessarie To þe Grekis, and be water carie, At request of Agamenoun, With-oute tariynge or dilacioun. And so þe kyng, with plente of vitaille Frau?t and y-lade, gan anon to saille Toward þe sege, he &amp; his meyne, Ay costeiynge by þe Grekysshe se. Þe wynde was good, &amp; þe kyng as blyve With his navie at Troye dide aryve In fewe dayes; and Grekis anon ri?t Of his repeire were ful glad &amp; ly?t, Of his expleit and his gode speed, Þat he so wel hath born hym in þis nede. And after þis, Pallamydes anoon, As seith Guydo, is to his shippes goon For to considre and loken al aboute Wher nede was, with-Inne &amp; with-oute, Any of hem to [a]mendyn or repare, As he þat list for no cost to spare, In euery þing, with-oute necligence, Touching his charge to don his dilligence, Til þe trews fully wern oute ronne, And þe werris new ageyn be-gonne, Whiche many man, sothly, dere abou?t. And ceriously to write how þei wrou?t, My purpose is, pleinly, in sentence, Vnder support of ?oure pacience. Of the dethe of Dephebus, sclayne by the hondys of Kynge Pallamydes with a spere. Dvring in oon þe dedly cruel hate, Þat stynte may nor cesse by no date Atwyxe Grekis and hem of þe toun, To grete damage and destruccioun On ouþer part, felyng ful vnswete,— Til on a day þei caste for to mete, As þei wer wont, proudly with spere &amp; sheld, With her wardis entryng in-to felde, Armyd ful bri?t vp-on ouþer syde, And embatailled stoute, &amp; ful of pride, Ful kny?tly han chose her grounde, &amp; take Her large baners, with þe wynde y-shake, Til þei to-gidre sodeinly han met. And alderfirst, Dephebus hath set, Freshe &amp; lusty, and of herte Irous, Vp-on a kyng called Cresevs; And of envie, þe story telleþ þan, On hors[e]-bake as þei to-gidre ran, Dephebus first with his spere as bliue Þoru?-oute þe brest euene dide him ryve Vn-to þe herte, þat he spake no more. Þe deth of whom Grekis pleine sore, And for his loue swiche a wo þei make, Þat al astonied þei han þe feld forsake, And gan anon vn-to her tentis fle. Þe whiche, in soth, whan þei of Troye se, Vp-on þe chas fast[e] gan hem spede, Vn-to þe tyme þat worþi Dyomede, And wiþ him eke þe kyng Pallamydes, Of hi?e dispit, cruel and merciles, With twenty þousand worþi kny?tes alle, Vp-on Troyens sodeynly arn falle, And mortally made hem lese her woye, And to resorte hom ageyn to Troye. And eke with Grekis, fel &amp; furious, Þe same tyme cam Thelamonyvs, Þat hi?t Aiax, þe stronge kny?tly man; And like a lyoun amonge hem as he ran Vp-on Troyens and hem ouer-sette, Casuelly in his weye he mette Cecylyen, lusty, freshe, and li?t, And of his tyme a wonder manly kny?t, And sone was to Priam, as I rede, Whom Thelamoun, prikyng on his stede, Slowe cruelly with his swerde anoon, Racynge his arme fro þe sholder bon, Þat he, allas! fil ded in þe feld. Þe deth of whom whan Dephebus behelde, Woder anon þan tigre or lyoun, With a spere ran to Thelamoun, And smet hym so þoru? his platis bri?t, Of verray force þat he made hym li?t, And lese his sadel, be-set amonge þe pres. Þe whiche strok, whan Pallamydes Behelde &amp; sawe, &amp; clerly gan aduerte, Irous &amp; wood, with a furious herte Caste hym anoon tavenge Thelamoun On Dephebus, ful worþi of renoun, And mortally his guerdoun hym to quyte; And with a spere, grounde for to byte, Sharpe &amp; kene, large, rounde, &amp; square, Ful cruelly, or þat he was ware, Þoru? his harneis, with-oute more arest, Dephebus he smote so in þe brest, Þat with þe strok he brake þe shafte a-two, So þat þe tronchoun &amp; þe hed also Left in his brest, þat þer was no weye, Finally, but þat he muste deye— Þer was noon helpe nor remedie at al; Þe wounde was so cruel and mortal, Þat with þe lyf he my?t[e] nat abyde. And in þis while, Parys cam be-side, Of auenture, while þis Dephebus Was of his wounde so inly anguysshous, And gan in hast for taprochen ner, With face pale and [ri?t] an heuy cher, And for distresse wepte pitously, And his kny?tes commandid hastily, His wounded broþer oute a-syde fere In al haste þat þei shulde bere, Oute of þe wardis fro þe grete pres, Vn-to his peyne for to do reles, For tabreþe hym at leyser, or tavente In open eyr. &amp; þei vn-to hym wente, Maugre þe Grekis, wher he wounded was, And bare hym oute a ful esy pace Toward þe wallis, fast[e] by þe toun, And with gret dool and lamentacioun Ful soft[e]ly on þe grounde hym layde, Til at the laste þis dedly man abreyde, With mortal loke and face funeral, And chere pitous, so þat eche bal Gan turnen vp of his dedly eye, And euene þus to Paris he gan seie: Dephebus requirede his brother Parys to revenge his deth vpone Kynge Pallamydes. “O broþer myn, whom þat I louede so, Haue now pite &amp; rewe vp-on my wo Of kyndenes and of broþerhede, And to my wordis of rouþe take now hede, Sith we be deth muste asonder twynne; For Antropos shal no lenger spynne My lyues þrede, but þe knot[te] breke. Wherfor, broþer, I praye þe be wreke Vp-on my deth, or I hen[ne]s pace, ?if þat þou list [to] do me swiche a grace Of kyndenes, ?et or I be ded,— Out of my brest or þis speris hed Be rent a-wey, þat þou avenged be Vp-on my fo, as I trust in þe, Þat I may wyte he be ded or I, And þat his spirit passe finally, And first descende depe doun in helle, Eternally with Pluto for to dwelle, Mid his boundis, þat dirke ben &amp; lowe. For, finally, so þat I may knowe Þat he be ded—þer is no more to seie, I gif no fors how sone þat I deie.” To whos requeste Paris toke good hede, And in þe feld fast[e] gan hym spede, For þou?t &amp; wo pitously wepynge, While his broþer lay þer languysshinge, Nat awayting but only after deth, Vp-on þe point to ?elden vp þe breth. And with his kny?tes Paris vp &amp; doun Þe wardis sou?t aboute[n] enviroun, Til at þe last Pallamydes he fond With Sarpedoun fi?tynge hond of hond. Now was þis kyng, þis worþi Sarpedoun, Come in diffence of hem of Troye toun, Whiche of his hond was a noble kny?t. And while þat he with al his ful[le] my?t Most besy was Pallamydes topresse, Liche a lyoun whetted wiþ woodnes, Pallamydes, in hert[e] nat aferd, Lete fleen at hym with his sharpe swerd So my?tely, þat it was a wonder; For he his þi?e partid hath a-sonder, And smote it of by þe harde boon, Þat Sarpedoun fil doun ded anoon— So þat Troyens, whan þat he was slawe, Were compelled of force hem to with-drawe, Þoru? þe pursut of kyng Pallamydes Whiche vp-on hem was so mercyles, And as cruel as a wood lyoun, After þe deth of worþi Sarpedoun. Þe whiche, allas, whan Paris did espie, He markid hym with a cruel eye, And hent a bowe þat passingly was stronge, And with an arwe to his tiler longe, Entoxycat with venym in þe hed, Þat whom he smot þer-with was but ded, And hitte hym so in þe aventaille, Þoru?-oute þe stuf and þe þikke maylle In-to his þrote þat it gan þoru? pace, Þat he fil ded in þe silve place, Pallamydes, þis manful worþi kny?t. Wher-þoru? Grekis toke hem to þe fli?t, And made a noyse and a woful crye, Þe deth compleynyng wonder pitously Of her lord and my?ty gouernour, But late chose to ben Emperour, Her chefe socour and souereyn refut. But now, allas! þei stonde destitut Of gouernaunce, broke &amp; disaraied, With-oute guyde, ri?t as shepe dismayed, Disconsolat &amp; confortles y-shent, Þat eche of hem fleth vn-to his tent. And þei of Troye suede on þe chas On hors[e]-bak a wonder huge pas, And mercyles slowe þem as þei fle, On euery side, þat rouþe was to se, With-oute pite or any oþer grace: For lyke lyouns þei gan hem enchase Til þei, compelled of necessite, Constreyned wern þoru? her cruelte To turne ageyn &amp; hem silfe defende. And þei of Troye doun anoon descende Of hors[e]-bak, euene vp-on þe pleyn; And alle attonys—þer was non oþer geyn— Þei gan þe Grekis proudly to outraye, And cruelly so to dis[a]maye, Þat finally þer geyneth no diffence, So mortal was þe my?ti violence Of Troyens, þat Grekis so diffoille; And aldirlast at leiser þei dispoille Þe Grekis tentis of gold and richesse. At whiche tyme Troylus gan hym dresse, And Parys eke doun to her navie With þritty þousand in her companye, Kyllynge alle þo, pleynly, þat þei mette, And on her schippes wylde fire þei sette, Þat to þe wallis of Troye þe cyte Men my?t[e] [wel] þe hydous flawme se. And all hadde gon to destruccioun, Nadde Aiax, y-called Thelamoun, Þoru? his manhod and kny?tly excellence Come anon and maked resistence Of þe Grekis, with many worþi kny?t. And þo of newe be-gan þe mortal fi?t A-twen Troyens and þe Grekis stoute, Þe rede blood raylyng al aboute Vp-on þe pleyn, so hydous[ly] þei blede; And here &amp; þere, boþe in lengþe &amp; brede, Ded &amp; maymed, and ful pale of si?t, Vp-on þe soyle lay many noble kny?t, Atwixen hem so cruel was þe hate: For in her fi?t to-gidre þei debate As wylde boris, evene so þei fare, For non of hem list oþer for to spare. And in þe felde worþi Thelamoun Þoru? his kny?thod &amp; his hi?e renoun So manly bare hym Grekis to diffende, Þat no man my?t in manhod him amende, Þoru? al þe worlde þou? men had[de] sou?t; For he þat day in his person hath wrou?t Merueille in armys, þoru? his gret[e] my?t, Þat, in sothnes, Grekis anoon ri?t With-outen hym hadde finally be shent, And her shippes attonys lost &amp; brent, Þoru? þe pursut of Paris þilke day, And worþi Troylus, þat made swiche affray Amonge[s] hem þoru? his hi?e prowes, Þat fifty shippes, Guydo doth expresse, Wer lost &amp; brent or þat Thelamoun To reskuse cam with his kny?tes doun Vn-to þe se, þe remenaunt for to save. But for al þat, Troyens þat day haue Þe hi?er hond of þis mortal fi?t, Þoru? þe force and þe grete my?t Of Troylus only, whiche hath so many slayn Of þe Grekis, in soþ, þat þei were fayn Hem to withdraw, and þe felde to lete, For in abidyng þei fond ful vnswete. Howe þe Kynge of Trace kam to þe tente of Achile, and exortyd hym to take the felde. Wherfore, þei gan for to lese her place, Amonge whiche þe kynges sone of Trace, Þat Heber hi?te, wounded to þe deth, Þat he my?t vnneþe drawe his breth, With a spere in his brest stikynge, To Achilles he cam in compleynyng Vn-to his tent, euene þere he lay, Whiche in þe feld was nat al þat day For the sake only of Polycene, Þe love of whom was so sharpe &amp; kene, Ay at his hert, y-liche grene and newe. To whom Heber, with a mortal hewe, Compleyneth sore, arettynge cowardyse, And in manhod a verray trowandyse, Þat he þat day my?t[e] so—for shame!— Withdrawen him, in hyndering of his name, Out of þe feld, to hym ful gret repref, Of þe Grekys seyng þe meschef Þat þei wern In, and confusioun, Vp-on þe brinke of her perdicioun— Abrod þe feld to sen hem so lye dede, And list not onys for to taken hede Of his kny?thod Grekis to releue. And while Heber gan hym þus repreve, And þe spere whiche in his body was Al sodeynly was drawen oute; allas! With eye vp-cast in rancour and in Ire, Ful pitously Heber dide expire In þe presence of þis Achilles. And þer-with cam in a sodeyn res In-to his tent a certeyn kny?t of his, Of whom Achilles axeþ how it is Amonge Grekis, &amp; clerly how it stood. And he answered, ful Irous in his mood: “Certis,” quod he, “ful vnhappily; For þei of Troye han so cruelly Oure Grekis alle þis day in her fi?t Ful shamefully put vn-to þe fli?t, So many slayn—allas &amp; wellawaye!— Þat vnneþe noon ne went away Vn-hurt-maymed, or with-oute wounde, So fel on vs Troyens were y-founde. And of hem eke was swiche a multitude, Þat I suppose, shortly to conclude, Þis day þer nas, to myn oppinioun, Nat left a man with-Inne Troye toun Þat able was to stonden in bataille, With spere or swerd his enmy to assaille, I wene, in soth, but þei comen oute With vs to fi?t,—þer was so huge a route Þat we ne my?t of force take on honde In þe feld ageyn[e]s hem to stonde. But now, my lord, it draweþ vn-to ny?t, Þat þei be feynt any more to fi?t,— ?if it were plesyng to ?our worþines, To ?our manhod &amp; ?oure hi?e noblesse To take on ?ou to ?oure encres of fame, For euere-more to ?ete ?ou a name, And þer-with-al for ?oure owne glorie, Perpetuelly to ben in memorie, To rysen vp and arme ?ow anoon, And sodeinly [vp-]on hem to goon, Feble and weyke to make resistence Ageyn ?oure manly famous excellence,— Þer wer no more, but we wer victours For euere-more, and verray conquerours, Durynge þe world to ben in remembraunce, And þei for euere brou?t vn-to outra[u]nce— In sothfastnes, I haue of hit no drede.” But Achilles toke of hym noon hede, Nor to Heber þat lay aforn hym ded, Ful colde and starke, of colour like to led, Nor onys list to ?eve hym audience, Nor vn-to hym han his aduertence— Þer may no word in his hert[e] myne To þat he seide to maken him enclyne: For, outerly, evene like he ferde, As þou?e he no maner worde ne herde; For þoru? his eris it passed as a soun. Lo, here þe maner and condicioun, Þe verray custom &amp; þe pleyn vsaunce Of þis loveris, hangyng in a trance:— Honour, worship, manhod, &amp; prowes, Strengþe, my?t, fame, and hardines, Encres of name, vertu, and victorie, Kny?thod, noblesse, and in armys glorie— Alle þese can Loue leyn a-syde: Swiche is þe my?t of þe god Cupide, Whiche hertis hi?e with his hok can sese— So loth þei arne, pleynly, to displese Ouþer in cher or in contenaunce, In wil or dede or disobeisaunce To hir þat is her souereyn lady dere. For, with a loke of hir eyen clere, She can ful wel daunte[n] al her pride: For Venus sone so felly can prouyde His arwys kene to perce nerf &amp; veyne, And hem enlacen in his firy cheyne, Þat only þoru? his importable charge Þei ben restreyned for to gon at large; Whiche cause was þis day, dout[e]les, Þat þis noble hardy Achilles Wolde nat, with-outen any wene, Come in þe feld, for drede of Polycene, List þat she were offendid in hir herte ?if any þing eskaped or asterte Þis Achilles, þoru? mysgouernaunce. And whiles he henge þus in balaunce, Þe Grekis fau?t with hem of þe toun Til bri?t Phebus was at goynge doun, Þat Troyens, of necessite, For lak of ly?t entre þe cyte. And while þat þei homward be repeired, Lay Dephebus, of his lyf dispeired, Compleynynge ay on his dedly wounde. And whan Paris &amp; Troylus han hym founde In þat meschef, þei gan wepe &amp; crye, As þei wolde for verray rouþe dye, With woful noyse and with pitous soun: Þe salt[e] teris gan to renne doun On her chekis vp-on ouþer syde; And whiles þei vppon hym abide, Þis wounded man gan drawe to his ende, Whos spirit was redy for to wende Out of his brest, &amp; his wery gost, Ful hastely in-to an oþer coste, With dedly eyen turned vp-so-doun. Whan þat he knewe by relacioun Þat Paris hath Pallamydes y-slawe, Anoon he bad þat þei shulde out drawe Þe large tronchoun with þe stelen hed; And þer-with-al anoon he fil doun ded. And with þe cors þei gan hem fast[e] spede Toward þe toun: but for it is no nede Þe dool to write and lamentacioun Þat maked was for hym and Sarpedoun Þoru? þe cite, &amp;, namly, of þe king And of þe quene, euere in on wepynge, Of his breþren and his sustres dere, It were but veyne to rehersen here. How Priamus burede Dephebus and Sarpedone, and howe the Grekes choyes Agamenon Emperoure. But Priam hath with gret[e] dilligence Twey tombes made, of royal excellence, For Dephebus and kyng Sarpedoun, With many ymage graven inviroun, And many knotte korven here &amp; ?onder, And buried hem but a litel assounder, Lyke þe custom of her rites olde. And whiles þei þe feste halwe &amp; holde Þat called is þe feste funeral, Þe Grekis han do made in special A riche tombe to þe worþi kyng Pallamydes, and for his buriyng Solempnely maked ordynaunce Amonges hem, as it was vsaunce; And with gret dool &amp; pitous heuynes Þei han þis kyng of gret worþines Rially brou?t to his sepulture. And for þei my?t longe nat endure With-oute an hed and a gouernour, Þei chosen han to her Emperour, By on assent and affeccioun, Þe worþi kyng, wyse Agamenoun. And after [þat] þei made no lettynge, —Þei of Troye—þe nexte day suynge, With her wardis in-to þe feld to goon, Fully purposed to fi?t[e] with her foon; And Grekis manly in þe face hem mette. But worþi Troylus so hem ouersette, Þat Greke was noon, shortly for to telle, Þilke day a-forn hym my?t[e] dwelle, So cruelly he gan hem for to chase: For where he cam or rode in any place, Þei fled his swerd, of her lif in doute, His ?onge kny?tes rydynge hym aboute, Swyche as he was vsant for to lede; And euere in oon þe Grekis blod þei shede, Whiche lyke a streme disteyned al þe pleyn. And al þis while was so huge a reyne, Þe same day, and so huge a myst, Þat euery man hath his felawe myst, Specially vp-on þe Grekis syde: Þat for þe storme and her woundes wide, And for þe manhod of þis Troyan kny?t, Worþi Troylus, so ?ong, so freshe &amp; ly?t, Þei were coact, þoru? his cruelte, Maugre her my?t, for drede of deth to fle To her tentis socour for to fynde, Troyens ay pursuyng be-hynde Ful mortally, with a sterne pas; But for þe storme þei cessen of þe chas, And home repeire to her cyte strong. Til on þe morwe, þat þe larke songe, Þat Troylus eft, most manly in bataille, Þe Grekis new cast hym for tassaille; And Guydo writ, þis ?onge champioun, Þilke day as he rod vp and doun Amonge his foon, þoru his hi?e renoun— Þat þere nas kyng, duke, erle nor baroun, With his swerd, where-so þat he wende, Þat of her lyf he made a mortal ende, Al þe while þat Phebus gaf his ly?t; Til at þe laste þat it drowe to ny?t, Þat he to Troye repeireth manfully. And sevene dayes, suynge by and by, Þis lif he ladde, with his kny?tes felle, Vp-on Grekis, as Guydo can ?ow telle; Ay newe &amp; newe he gan hem so confounde, His cruel swerd was so kene grounde, Þat þei ne my?t in his mortal tene Aforn his si?t abide nor sustene, Nor þe vengaunce þat he on hem toke: For where he rod þe weye þei forsoke, In his traas þe rengis were so rede Of hem, in soth, þat in þe feld lay dede. For whiche slau?ter and confusioun, Þe Grekis newe sent[e] to þe toun For a trew to Priamus þe kyng; And he anoon graunted her axyng For two monþes, fully be thassent Of alle þe lordis of his parlement. Wher-of þei made ful relacioun— Thenbassatours—to Agamenoun; And to her loggyng after furþe þei went. But how þat he vn-to Achilles sent Þe mene while his messageris wyse, So as I can, I shal anoon deuyse. Achilles kept his Tent, and in no wyes wolde fight agayns þe Troians, for þe love of Polycene; for the which, Agamenon, with þe princes of Grece, kam to viset hym in his tent. Agamenoun, as Guydo list endyte, His lordis sent Achilles to visite For certeyn causes, like as ?e shal here, Whiche in þe story be rehersid here. And with Vlixes and worþi Diomede, Duke Nestor went, pleynly, as I rede, To fyn only, by her conseillynge In-to his hert þat þei my?t[e] bringe And induce hym to han a fantasie To be willy, þoru? his chiualrie, With hem to stonde as he haþ do to-forn, Þat han so many of her men y-lorn For lake only of his [hi?e] presence. And Achilles with digne reuerence Reseyved hem, &amp; with ri?t kny?tly chere. And after þat, whan þei wer set y-fere Like her degre anoon in audience, Wyse Vlixes, ful of elloquence, Gan his tale prudently deuyse, To Achilles seyinge in þis wyse: Vlixes taile to Achile. “Sir Achilles, most renomed of glorie, Þoru?-oute þe world to ben in memorie, And of kny?thod verray sours &amp; welle, Displese it nat, now þat I shal telle To ?oure noble famous excellence, Nor to ?our eris late be noon offence Þat I shal seyn, but of goodlyhede, Paciently þat ?e wil take hede To my wordes, seide of hert and þou?t, I ?ow ensure, for I feyne nou?t; Þis to seyn, ?if ?e remembre wel, Þe first[e] cause and purpos euerydel Of þe Grekis—?if ?e haue mencioun— Was fully set by oon entencioun, As wel of ?ow as of vs, parde, Whan we cam firste to þis cite, Kynges, princes, I excepte noon, —Of whiche, in soth, to rekne euerychon, ?oure-silf[e] was, to speke in special, On of þe first &amp; most principal— Assentid ful how Troye þe cite Þoru? oure manhod distroied shuld[e] be— Perpetuelly brou?t vn-to ruyne. But now of new, I not what doth enclyne ?oure worþines sodeinly to varie, An[d] to oure purpos for to be contrarie: Considerid first of ?ow þat ben so sage Þe wronges done &amp; þe gret damage In Grekis lond of hem of þe toun, Conspirynge ay to oure distruccioun —?if ?e aduerte wysly in ?oure þou?t— Þat slay[e]n han and to an ende brou?t Ful many worþi, siþen go ful ?ore, And of tresour, þat no man may restore, Dispoiled vs, &amp; brou?t in gret distresse, Oure goodes rau?t, oure gold &amp; oure richesse, Oure shippes brent, þoru? her cruelte!

And her-vppon, we praie now þat ?e Seye ?oure avis and ?oure fulle wille.” The answer of feres Achile to the mocyoun of wies Vlixes and othere princes of Grece. And þan anon, þe hardy ferse Achille, Whanne Vlixes concludid hadde his tale, With a face for anger ded and pale Seide euene þus, al openly and pleyn: “Sir Vlixes, ?if so be as ?e seyn, And han declared, in conclusioun, Þat oure purpos and entencioun Was finally to brennen and distroye Þis royal cite þat is called Troye, I holde, in soth, (me liketh nat to lye) Þat oure entent was grounded on folye— To putte vs alle þoru? indiscrecioun, Of rekleshed and hasty mocyoun, Of lyfe and deth in swyche Iupartye. And specially alle þe cheualrye Of Grekis lond, for so smal a þing— So many prince &amp; many worþi kyng, Þat han iupartid her body &amp; her good, I-lost her lyf, and I-spent her blood, Whiche my?t haue ben ful wel at home in pes. And is nat now þe kyng Pallamydes I-slawe also, as who seiþ but of newe, Þat was so wis, so manly and so trewe,— Of whom þe lyf was of more pris allone Þan þe cause for whiche þat we echone Be gadred here, who-so loke a-ri?t. And of Grekis many a noble kny?t Þat haue be slayn, boþe of þe worþiest, Þe world to seke, and þe manlyest: For oute of euery lond and regioun, On Grekis party, &amp; with hem of þe toun, Of chiualrie and of kny?thod floure, To wynne in armys worship &amp; honour, Assemblid ben, and come fro so ferre,— Of whiche, in soth, by dures of þis werre Ful many oon in þe felde is ded; And, verraily, wiþ-outen any dred, Þer shal wel more ?if þe werre last: For euery day þe noumbre lasseth fast Of worþi kny?tes, ded with-oute rouþe, Þat I dar seyn &amp; conclude of trouþe, In þis rage, furious and wood, Ful likly is þat al þe gentil blood Þoru?-out þe world shal distroied be; And rual folke—and þat wer gret pite— Shal han lordshipe &amp; holy gouernaunce, And cherles eke, with sorwe &amp; meschaunce, In euery lond shal lordis ben allone, When gentil-men slay[e]n bene echone. Is nat Hector, þat was so noble a kny?t, Þat was þis worldis verray sonne &amp; li?t, Of manhood flour, slay[e]n pitously In þis werre?—in soth, and so my?t I, Par auenture, whiche may nat atteyne To his noblesse, ?if I shal nat feyne. For be what way shal we þe deth eschewe, With al oure my?t ?if we it purswe Fro day to day while þat we lyn here? Þerfore, shortly, me for to requere, Touching þe werre, ouþer for to praye, Is but [in] veyn. &amp; herkene what I seye: I nat purpose in þis werre or strif For to iuparte any more my lif, For leuer I haue þat palled be my name Þan to be slayn, &amp; han an Idel fame; For worþines, after deth I-blowe, Is but a wynde, &amp; lasteth but a þrowe; For þou? renoun &amp; pris be blowe wyde, For?etilnes leith it ofte a-syde By lengþe of ?eris and obliuioun, Þoru? envie and fals collucioun. Þe laude of kny?thod &amp; of worþines, Of wysdam eke, &amp; of gentilnes, Fredam, bounte, vertu, &amp; swiche grace, For?etilnes can dirken and difface; And, þer-with-al, malys and envie I-serid hath þe palme of chiualrie By fals report. Wherfore, I seie, for me, I wil of wisdam swiche foly lete be, And in quiete forþe my lyf now lede; And ouer þis, to ?ou þre I rede To seke pes with Troyens ?if ?e may, In hasty wyse, wiþ-oute more delay. Þis is my conseil, platly, to ?ow alle, Or þat meschef of deth vp-on ?ow falle; It were wel don þat ?e token hede, Boþe Vlixes and þou Dyomede, And Nestor eke, siþen ?e be wyse, To werke, pleynly, lyke as I deuyse. Þis is þe somme &amp; fyn of myn entent, And so reporteþ to hym þat haþ ?ou sent.” And þei anoon, with short conclusioun, Repeired ben to Agamenoun With swiche answer as ?e han herd me seyn, It nedeth nat to write it new ageyn. And her-vppon kyng Agamenoun Lete make anoon a convocacioun Of his lordis; &amp;, in her presence, Fro point to point, sothly, in sentence He hath reheresed how þat Achilles Was desirous for to han a pes With hem of Troye, and platly how þat he For no praier wil in no degre Ageyn Troyens, with spere no[r] with shelde, In helpe of Grekis ben armyd in þe feld. Wherfore, þe kyng, as he þat was ful wys, Her-vppon axed her avys, And what hem þou?te was best for to do In þis mater, siþen it stood so. And first of alle spekeþ Menelay, With angry chere, &amp; seyde, platly, nay, To han a pes it was nat his entent, Ne þat he wolde þer-to be of assent, Siþen þe cite, in conclusioun, Stood on þe prikke of his distruccioun, Now þat Hector &amp; Dephebus were dede Þat whilom wern her trust in euery nede And her diffence; but now þei arn a-goo— Fare wel her trust &amp; her hope also, With-oute more, and al her olde pride, Þei may nat now but after deþ abide: “And trusteþ wel, with-oute[n] any les, Þou? it so be þat þis Achilles Ne helpe vs nat toward oure emprise, We dar nat drede, in no maner wyse, With-outen hym [for] to han victorie By oure manhood &amp; oure owne glorie,— I am ful sure her-of and certeyn.” But Vlixes gan replie ageyn; Nestor also, of sodeyn mocioun, Contrarie was to his oppinioun, Affermynge, platly, þat no wonder was Þou? Menelay, sothly, in þis cas Vn-to [þe] pes wolde nat assent; For openly þei wiste what he ment, For he was grounde &amp; rote of al þe werre And cause also þei comen were so ferre Oute of her lond,—he &amp; þe quene Eleyne. And for þe sake only of hem tweyne, Þe Grekis alle, whiche no man may denye, Her lyves putte in swiche Iupartye, For hym &amp; hir, ?if þe grounde be sou?t; For wel þei wiste þat he rou?t[e] nou?t, Þis Menelay, what wo þei endure, So he his wyf my?t ageyn recure. And wher he seiþ þat Hector is ded, He hath an eyr, to speke of manlihed And of kny?thod, as it wil be fonde, And called is Hector þe secounde,— Worþi Troylus, whiche þat is his broþer; In al this world is not swiche anoþer Of worþines, for to reknen al: For he of Troye is þe my?ti wal And diffence, now Hector is [a-]goon;— ?e knowen it wel ?oure silven euerychon, ?if it so be þat ?e list take hede,— Whos sharp[e] swerde sore doth vs blede Euery day in his furious hete, Amyd þe feld whan we with him mete. And in stede of worþi Dephebus, Whiche in his tyme was wonderly famus, His broþer Paris is now founde at al In worþines of kny?thod perigal, So þat of hem we han non avauntage In-to þis hour, but raþer gret damage, To reknen al, siþen we be-gonne: Þis verray soth, we haue but litel wonne, But we ar lykly alwey more to lese ?if we contune; but siþe we may chese, It wer holsom to lyven in quiete, To han a pes, and þis werre lete, By oon assent, siþen ?e be wyse.” Howe the Grekes had broke ther sege, ne had þe exortacyon ybe of þe Troyan traytour Calchas. And with þat word, Calchas gan to rise, Þe Troyan traytour, with a pale chere For verray Ire, &amp; seide as ?e shal here: “A, worþi princes, what þinke ?e to done, To chaunge so, lyk as doth þe mone, ?oure olde purpos &amp; ?our first entent, Ageyn ?e wil and comaundement Of þe goddis, þat euery þing gouerne By purviaunce, who-so can discerne. Allas, allas, whi nyl ?e at þe leste Credence and feith ?even to her heste, Whiche in no wyse may nat be fallible: For, in soth, it wer an impossible, Outterly, but Troye þe cite Of ordinaunce and necessite, Mut be distroied hen[ne]s but a lyte, ?if ?oure slouþe be it nat to wyte, So þat victorie, worship, and honour, And final palme eke of þis labour, To be reported on water &amp; on lond, Reserued ben hooly to ?oure hond, In ?oure purpos ?if ?e forþe contune, And hindre nat of foly ?oure fortune. Þis is in soth, I dar it wel conclude, And perllous is þe goddis to illude Of necligence or slouþe wilfully. Wherfore, I rede þat now manfully, Of herte &amp; þou?t, &amp; of ful vnite, Platly deuoidynge al ambyguyte, To sette vppon, &amp; kny?tly to reswme ?oure force ageyn, fully to conswme ?oure cruel foon; &amp; late be shet with-oute Wanhope &amp; drede, dispeir &amp; euery doute, Castynge of peril, slouþe &amp; cowardyse; And lete manhod outterly dispise Al drede of deth, þat causeþ hertis feinte With cowardyse for to ben atteynte, Þat finally, as goddis han be-hi?t Þoru? prescience of her eternal my?t, To victorie þat ?e shal atteyne Lyke ?oure desyre,—þer is no more to seyne.” And whan Calchas, in conclusioun, Þis fals[e] traytour vn-to Troye toun, Þe Grekis had þoru? his wordis faire, Touching þe werre, put out of dispaire, Of hert al oon [þei] caste hem to fulfille Hooly his counseil, þou? so be þat Achille Be froward [ay] to helpe hem in her nede— Þei ?af no force, &amp; toke of it non hede; But euerychon þei hem redy make, As ?e shal here, þe feld in hast to take. Aftir the trewes, the Troyans and þe Grekes resumede the felde, in þe which the Grekis might not susteyne against þe swerde of Troylus; for þe which Agamenon sent for a trewe of vj monethes. The trew[e]s passid of þe monþes tweyne, In-to þe feld þe Grekis hem ordeyne; And þei of Troye ageyn hem issen oute. And worþi Troylus with an huge route Þe Grekis gan alderfirst assaille; And with his swerd he made first to raile Þe rede blod þoru? her harnes bri?t, Þat as þe deth þei fled[de] fro his si?t: For he þat day þoru? his cruelte Cast hym fully avenged for to be Vp-on þe deth of Hector, outterly. And as Dares reherseth specially, A þousand kny?tes þis Troyan champioun Þat day hath slayn, ridyng vp &amp; doun, As myn auctor, Guydo, list endite— Saue after hym I can no ferþer write, In his boke he ?eveth him swiche a name— Þat by his manhod &amp; his kny?tly fame Þe Grekis alle wer put vn-to þe fli?t Al þilke day, til it drowe to ny?t. And on the morwe in þe daw[en]ynge, Þe Grekis han, at Phebus vp-rysynge, I-armed hem with gret dilligence, Ageyn Troyens to stonden at diffence. Amonges whom þat day, as I rede, So wel hym bar worþi Diomede, Þat many Troyan þoru? his cruelte Hath loste his lyf, til Troilus gan to se Þis Diomede in þe feld ridyng, To whom anoon, with-oute more lettyng, With his spere þrowe in-to þe reste, Þis Troilus rod, &amp; hit hym oon the breste So my?tely, þat of verray nede Doun of his hors he smet Dyomede, Al-be of wounde he had[de] no damage. And furiously Troilus in his rage, Of envie gan hym to abreide, Whan he was doun, þe love of Cryseide, Of his deceit and his trecherie. And Grekis þan fast[e] gan hem hye, Amonge the hors in meschef where he lay, To drawe him oute in al þe hast þei may; And on a sheld, brosed &amp; affraied, Þei bare him hom, so he was dismaied Of þe stroke, home vn-to his tent. And Menelay þe same while haþ hent A my?ty spere tavenge Dyomede, And to Troilus fast[e] gan hym spede, Fully avysed to vnhorsen hym anon. But Troylus first made his stede goon So swyfte a course toward Menelay, Þat he anoon at þe erþe lay,— So my?tely he hit hym with his spere, Þat shelde &amp; plate my?t[e] hym nat were, To sauen hym from a mortal wounde. But his kny?tes, anon as þei him founde, Oute of þe pres whan þei had hym rent, Þei bar hym hom to his owne tent, Þe Grekis ay stondyng in distresse Þoru? þe kny?thod &amp; þe hi?e prowes Of þis Troylus, whiche haþ hem so beleyn, On euery part, where he rod on þe pleyn, Til vn-to tyme þat Agamenoun In-to þe felde is avaled doun With many worþi abouten his baner, Þat shon ful shene ageyn þe sonne cler. And with his kny?tes [hym] ridyng enviroun He sore enchased hem of Troye toun, Woundeth &amp; sleth &amp; put hem to þe fli?t, Hym silfe aquytynge lik a manly kny?t; But for al þat, with-oute more abood, Amongis Troyens fersely as he rood, Þis worþi kyng, grete Agamenoun, With a spere Troylus smet hym doun Maugre his Grekis—þer geineþ no socour. And whan þei sawe her lord, her gouernour In swyche meschef at þe grounde lyende, Þei hent hym vp, &amp; made hym to ascende, Þoru? her manhod, on his stronge stede. And he of wyt gan to taken hede, And consider wysly in his þou?t In what disioynt Troylus had hem brou?t, And how his Grekis, for al her gret[e] pride, To-forn his swerde my?t[e] nat abide— He prudently, of hi?e discrecioun, Þis noble kny?t, kyng Agamenoun, As he þat hadde ay his aduertence On gouernaunce, þoru? his prouidence, Whanne he sawe his Grekis gonne faille And wexe feble to stonden in bataille For lak of stuf þat shulde hem recounforte, Ful prudently he made hem to resorte, Eueryche of hem, to his owne tent. And after þat he hath to Priam sent For a trew, to Troye þe cite, For sixe monþes, ?if it my?t[e] be. And by his conseil, Priamus þe kyng, With-oute abood granted his axyng, Al-be þat somme, as Guydo list endite, Were euel apaied so longe to respite Her mortal fon, in any maner wyse; But ?it his graunt, as ?e han herd deuise, Stood in his strengþe fully, as I rede. Howe doubyle Cresseyd, agayns the wylle of here Fader, went to vyset Dyomede in his Tente. In whiche tyme, of verray womanhede, Cryseyde list no lenger for to tarie, Þou? hir fader wer þer-to contrarie, For to visite, and to han a si?t Of Diomede, þat was be-come hir kny?t, Whiche had of Troylus late kou?t a wounde. And in his tent whanne she haþ hym founde, Benignely, vp-on his beddis syde She set hir doun, in þe silve tyde, And platly cast in hir owne þou?t, Touchinge Troylus, þat it was for nou?t To lyue in hope of any more recure, And þou?t she wolde for no þing be vnsure Of puruyaunce, nor with-oute stoor:— She ?af anoon, with-outen any mor, Hooly hir herte vn-to Diomede. Loo! what pite is in wommanhede, What mercy eke &amp; benygne routhe— Þat newly can al her olde trouthe, Of nature, late slyppe a-syde Raþer þanne þei shulde se abide Any man in meschef for hir sake! Þe change is nat so redy for to make In Lombard Strete of crowne nor doket— Al paie is good, be so þe prente be set: Her lettre of change doth no man abide! So þat þe wynde be redy and þe tyde, Passage is ay, who-so list to passe! No man is lost þat list to seke grace— Daunger is noon but counterfet disdeyn; Þe se is calme and fro rokkis pleyn: For mercyles neuer man ne deide Þat sou?t[e] grace!—recorde of Cryseyde, Whiche finally hath ?oven al hir herte To Diomede in reles of his smerte, And praide hym to be ri?t glad &amp; li?t, And called hym hir owne man, hir kny?t, And hym behi?t, raþer þan he deie, In euery þing how she wolde obeye, Þat were honest, hym to do plesaunce: For leuere she had chaunge &amp; variaunce Were founde in hir þanne lak of pite, As sittyng is to femynyte, Of nature nat [to] be vengable, For feith nor oþe, but raþer mercyable Of mannys lyf stondyng in distresse. Her-of no more; for now I wil me dresse To telle forþe in my translacioun Ceriously how Agamenoun Duryng þe trewe &amp; þe tyme of pes Hym siluen went vn-to Achilles, Besechynge hym som rewarde to haue, Of his kny?thod Grekis for to saue, And his presence no more to withdraw, To suffren hem so mortally be slawe Of her enmyes, pompos and elat. But Achilles, alweye indurat, I-liche newe, boþe in herte &amp; þou?t, From his purpos platly chaungeþ nou?t, Fully enclyned for to han a pes. But for-as-moche as þis Achilles Of enternes and affeccioun So lovynge was to Agamenoun, He vn-to hym graunted at þe leste A gret parcel touchinge his request: Þis to seyn, þat þis Achilles Granteth to hym hys Mirundones, Ful kny?tly men, only in his absence With [þe] Grekis to make resistence In þe felde ageyn hem of þe toun. For whiche grant, kyng Agamenoun And duke Nestor þankyd hym of herte. But he, alweye contunyng in his smerte For þe loue of feire Polycene, Ne knewe no geyn to his woundis grene, But dispeired, languyssheþ euer in oon. And whan þe trews passed wern &amp; gon, Vp-on a day, þe morwe, ful benygne, Achilles his kny?tes dide assigne Þe feld to take with Agamenoun; And, as þe story makeþ mencioun, He ?af to hem bendys fresche of red, Þat men may knowe by her manlyhed With whom þei wern with-holde in special. And lyke a man dedly and mortal, In his tent Achilles abood, In-to þe feld from hym whan þei rood, Only for dool þei shuld[e] from him twynne, In his absence a werre to be-gynne Maugre his wille ageyn hem of þe toun; But forþe þei went with Agamenoun Vp-on Troyens, sterne and ful of pride. But with hem mette on þe toþer syde Þe manly kny?tes of Troyanyshe blod, Whiche wern on hem so furious and wod, Þat cruelly þe Grekis þei oppresse, So þat abak for fere þei gan hem dresse— Þei wern on hem so inly fel &amp; kene— Til þat þe duke þat lord was of Atthene Entrid in þe Grekis to diffende. But vp-on hym, vnwarly, or he wende, Cam my?ty Troylus lyk a wod lyoun, And from his stede anoon he bar him doun; And, after þat, he put hym so in pres, Til he mette with Mirundones, And of hem slowe þat day ful many on. And so fer in Troylus is y-goon, Þat he Grekis putte outterly to fli?t Þoru? his kny?thod, til hit drow to ny?t: For from his swerd no ransoun my?t hem borwe. And Guydo writ, þat on þe nexte morwe Ful mortal was þe slau?ter on owþer syde, Amyd þe feld as þei to-gyder ryde, Of manly kny?tes, þat wonder was to sene. And, as þei fau?t, þe kyng Philymene With helpe only of Pallydamas Taken hath þe worþi kyng Thoas, And gan hym lede toward Troye toun; But Mirundones on hym come doun Wonder proudly, &amp; after gan to swe, And þoru? her my?t Thoas þei reskwe, And hym delyuere, for þei wer so stronge. But Troylus þan hurtled hem amonge Furiously, lyke a champioun,— Now her, now þer, cast &amp; þrewe hem doun: Somme he slowe, &amp; somme he made blede, Til cruelly þei slow his my?ty stede Whiche he sat on; and ?it, neuerþeles, He fau?t on fote ageyn Mirundones, Þat had caste Troylus to haue take. But Parys tho gan hem so awake, With his breþer þat a-boute hym rood, Þat in þe place where as Troylus stood Vp-on his fet, but hym silfe allone, Of Mirundones þei slow many one,— Þat of kny?thod, þoru? her manlyhede Þei vn-to hym brou?t anoþer stede, Amyd his foon, and made hym to ascende. And he ful kny?tly gan hym silfe diffende, Beset with Grekis in þe silfe stounde, Þat neuere ?it a better kny?t was fonde: Þei felt it wel, þei þat wer his foon. But þanne his broþer, called Emergaron, So as he fau?t, puttynge him silfe in pres, Was slayn, allas! amonge Mirundones. Þe deth of whom, in a cruel ire, Troylus with anger newe set a-fire, Pleynly purposeth tavenge ?if he may; And with his swerd he gan to make way, And Parys ay fast[e] by rydynge, And alle his breþer vp-on him awaitynge,— Whiche alle I-fere wer so mercyles, As I fynde, vp-on Mirundones, Þat of force and necessite Þei wer compelled pleynly for to fle, Troylus on hem was so furious, So vengable eke and so dispitous, Þat he hem ?af many mortal wounde. And ?it, in soth, þat day þei wer founde Noble kny?tes, &amp; quit hem wonder wel: For þei þe crafte knewe[n] euerydel Longynge to armys, of hem as I rede. But for al þat, he made her sydes blede Þoru? þe maille &amp; her plates shene, Þat þei ne my?t, pleynly, nat sustene Þe swerd of Troylus, hem chasyng oueral, Al-be þei kepte hem clos as any wal— Hool to-gidre, and went nat asounder. But Troylus ay hem chaseth her &amp; ?onder, And seuered hem maugre al her my?t. Til in-to feld with many worþi kny?t Cam Menelay and kyng Agamenoun, Vlixes eke, and cruel Thelamoun, And Diomede, whiche of his woundis grene Recured was, as seiþ myn auctor clene;— And on Troyens sodeinly þei falle With her wardis and her kny?tes alle: And þo began þe fi?t[e] to renewe On euery half, þat with blody hewe Þe platis bri?t wern of newe steyned; And þei of Troye so manly han hem peyned Ageyn her foon in þis my?ty stryf, Þat many Greke was berafte his lyf; And where þei wern most my?ti in batail, Troylus cam in, &amp; gan hem to assail On euery parte, with many blody wounde, And by his kny?thod gan hem so confounde Þat ay þei fled, so þei wern aferd Þe mortal strokis of his sharpe swerd, Her dedly foo and destruccioun. And þis contuneth til kyng Thelamoun, By his manhod, whan þat he beheld, Þe Grekis made recure ageyn þe felde, And gan Troyens assaille wonder sore. And þo be-gan þe slau?ter more &amp; more On eche-a-side, til Troylus newe ageyn Þe Grekis hath so fersly ouerleyn, Mirundones and hem euerychon, Aforn his swerd þat he made hem goon To her tentis, and þe feld forsake. And with his hond þat day he haþ take An hundrid kny?tes þat cam in his woye, Þoru? his prowesse, &amp; sent hem in-to Troye. And euere in on gan so to enchase Mirundones, þat þei lost her place, And to Achille, liggynge in his tent, Þei repeire, for-wounded &amp; to-rent, Her harneis broke, boþe plate &amp; maille. And of noumbre, I fynde, þat þei faille An hundrid kny?tes, slayn &amp; ded, allas, Þat after wer y-founde in þe taas Amyd þe feld, þoru? girt with many wounde Of Troylus swerd,—Hector þe secounde. Wher-of Achille, whan he had a si?t, So hevy was al þe next[e] ny?t, In his bed walwynge to and fro, Deuoide of slepe for constreint of his wo,— At his hert his wounde was so kene, What for his men &amp; faire Polycene, Wetyng wel, ?if he dide his peyne To be vengid, he shulde nat atteyne In no wyse vn-to his desire. And þus he brent in a double fyre Of loue and Ire, þat made him si?e sore; But for cause loue was þe more, He was a-ferd ageyn hem of þe toun In his persone to done offencioun, List Priamus and Eccuba þe quene Offendid wern, &amp; namly Pollycene. And þus he stood in a double wer, Þat at his hert sat hym wonder ner, With many wonder diuerse fantasie, As haue louers þat be in point to dye: Ri?t euene-so fareth þis woful man, For verray wo þat no red ne can, So entriked þat he wende dye, Of his recure he knewe no better weye. And while he laie þus in his þrowes white (Liche as Guydo pleinly list endite, And þe story makeþ mencioun), Þat dayes seuene þei of Troye toun, To encres &amp; awgment of her sorwe, With þe Grekis metten euery morwe: Þat þoru? þe force of her boþer my?t, On ouþer part was slay[e]n many kny?t. And al þis while lay þis Achilles, Of Grekis deth y-liche rec[e]les, For loue only, &amp; toke no maner hede Who-so were hool or mortally doth blede, Or who þat pleyneth with his woundis large— Hym þou?t it was no parcel of his charge, So moche he haþ on oþer þing to þenke, Þat ofte he waketh whan he sholde winke, Þou?tful ay and ymagynatyf, And verray wery of his owne lyf. Til on a day, kyng Agamenoun, Seynge þe deth and destruccioun On Grekis halfe, with-oute remedie, To Troye sent by enbassatrye For a trewe certeyn dayes space, But he my?t þer-of haue no grace Lenger tyme, platly, to endure, Þan for leyser of þe sepulture Of worþi kny?tes þat wer ded to-forn, In þe feld on ouþer part y-lorn, Which in þe taas ful besely þei sou?t. And after þis, pleynly, how þei wrou?t Duryng þe sege with gret violence, I shal discrive with ?oure pacience. Howe the Troyans, the trewes endede, made so mortale were vpone the Grekes that, thorght the manhode and the blody swerde of Troylus, the Grekes wer brought ful nygh to outterance. The cruel force &amp; þe mortal Ire Of Martis my?t, alweie set a-fire With newe envie, gonne of old hatrede, Brennynge in hertis hoot as any glede, Atwixe Grekis and Troye þe cyte, Whiche likly is nat staunched for to be Til deth consume with his mortal darte Ful many worþi vp-on ouþer parte, Texecute, allas! by fynal fate Eche on oþer þenvious dedly hate, Whiche þei ne my?t by destyne remewe Nor for parchas at liberte eschewe: For Antropos wil suffre it be noon oþer, Þat is maistresse &amp; guyer of þe rother Of Dethis ship, til al go vn-to wrak! And Fortune gan turne hir face bake Of hi?e disdeyn fro Troye þe cite, As in þis story ri?t sone ?e shal se. For whan þe trews þat þei had[de] take Wer werid oute, þei gan [hem] redy make —Þe proude Grekis,—&amp; in-to felde þei gon Vp-on a morwe, whan Phebus bri?t[e] shon, Armyd ful shene, eueryche at his devis. And Menelay first mette with Parys, Þilke day, in story as I rede, And eche of hem smet oþer of his stede; At whyche tyme, daun? Pallydamas To Vlixes rod a sterne pas, And eche at oþer, of cruel enmyte, With stiffe swerdis gan to-gidre fle, Þat nouþer was of manhod for to wyte. And with a spere, squared for to byte, Þe my?ty duke, called Meneste, Rood lyne ri?t, þat alle my?t[e] se, To Anthenor, þe Troyan ful of pride, And from his sadel cast hym doun a-side, In his furie &amp; his hatful tene. And þo in al haste cam kyng Phylymene, Only in helpe of hem of þe toun, And gan assaille kyng Agamenoun Þoru? his kny?thod &amp; his hardynes, Þat he him had brou?t in gret distresse, To outter meschef and confusioun, Nadde only be þat kyng Thelamoun Ful proudly cam hym [for] to reskewe, And after sore gan for to purswe With a spere vp-on Philomene, And from his horse he leide hym on þe grene, Maugre his force, þe story telleþ þus, For he to hym was mortally Irous. And after þat, ?onge Archilogus A mortal cours ran vn-to Brumvs, Oon of þe sonys of Priamus þe kyng, ?onge and delyuer, &amp; best in his lykyng; But he hym smet with so gret a my?t Þat he fil ded, þis freshe lusty kny?t: Þe deth of whom, whan þei of Troye espie, Þei made a shou?t, &amp; pitously gan crye Of woful routh, &amp; his deth compleyne, Til þe noise gan outterly atteyne To Troylus eris, platly, where he rood. And he no lenger after þat abood, But to þe place felly gan aproche, And with his swerd for to sette a-broche, With-oute rouþe, þe Grekis hatful blood, And, mercyles, al þat hym with-stood He slowe þat day, by cruel auenture, Þat Greke was noon, þe whiche my?t endure To-forn his swerd—he gan hem so oppresse: For of kny?thod and [of] hi?e prowesse He hadde hem putte outterly to fly?t, Nad[de] ben þe manhod &amp; þe my?t Of Mirundones, whiche al þat day By oon assent vp-on Troylus lay, Wher-of he was ful malencolius; And of corage &amp; manhod most famus, He ne list no lenger for to lette, B[ut] al attonys vp-on hem he sette, And furiously gan amonge hem ryde. And somme he smet euene þoru? þe syde, Þoru? the body, &amp; some þoru? þe herte; And with his swerd þoru? doublet &amp; sherte, Þoru? sheld and plate, &amp; þoru? haberioun He percid hath, and like a wood lyoun He slow þat day of hem many oon, Þat maugre hem þei fledden euerychon, With þe Grekis, eueryche to his tent. And þei of Troye after hem be went Swyftly on horse, til þei han hem take; And swiche a morder of Grekis þer þei make, Þat finally þer was no bet reskus But only deth, so passyngly confus Þe Grekis wern at meschef desolat,— Troilus so narwe brou?t hem to chek-maat, Þat þei koude no better remedie But hidously for to wayle and crye, To deth forwounded, with a grisly chere. Howe Achilles for-gat the love of Polycene when he sawe the Grekis at þe poynt of confusyon. Þat Achilles, whan he gan first here Þe dredful noise and þe woful soun, Þat caused was by refleccioun Of eir a-?en—who-so koude it knowe— In rochis harde and kauernys lowe, Lyke as it wer o word spoke of two, Þat men ar wont to callen an Ecko— So confus was þe lamentacioun On Grekis side;—of whiche þe dedly soun So pitously to Achilles is ronne, Of hem þat laye ageyn þe hote sonne, With mortal woundes ?eldinge vp þe breþe, With rowmble &amp; swowe resownyng in-to deþe— Swiche a noise Grekis made þere. And what it mente Achilles dide enquere, And what þe cause was of her clamour; And þei tolde hym, for lak of socour Þe Grekis wern eche in his tentorie Of Troylus slayn, so þat þe victorie Goth finally with hem of Troye toun For euere-more, in conclusioun: So many Greke lay slay[e]n in his tent, Gaping vpward, þat haþ his blood y-spent, Þoru? þe constreynt of his woundes smerte. And while Achilles þis meschef gan aduerte, Ful sodeinly þer cam to hym a man, Þe whiche his tale euene þus be-gan: “Allas,” quod he, “how many ?e sustene To sen ?our men her vp-on þe grene A-fore ?oure face slayn &amp; ly[e]n dede, And liste nat onys for to taken hede, But stonde stille, pensif in ?oure tent, Vp-on þe point ?oure silfe to be shent In hasty hour, ?if ?e here abide: For fifty þousand kny?tes here be-side, Redy armyd in platis and in maille, Cast hem pleinly attonys ?ou tassaille— Þis no doute—vn-armyd as ?e stonde, But ?e of kny?thod manly take on honde To resiste in þis silfe place, And like a man to mete hem in þe face.” For whiche anon, in a cruel mood, Þis Achilles, like as he were wood, Armed hym, fomynge as a boor;— Fare-wel his loue! he set of it no stoor; Of hasty hete his Ire was so kene Þat he forgat faire Polycene And hir bewte, þat whilom made him smerte. And in a rage vp anoon he sterte, And toke his stede, as any lyoun wroþe Ageyns Troyens, &amp; in-to feld he goth: Lyche a wolfe þat is with hunger gnawe, Ri?t so gan he ageyn his foon to drawe; And where he rood, with-oute excepcioun, He woundeþ, sleþ, kylleþ, &amp; bereth doun— Now here, now þere—in a lytel þrowe, Þat þei of Troye gan his swerd [to] knowe, Whiche was infect of newe with her blood: For þer was noon as ?it þat hym with-stood, So mortally he gan aboute hym leyn Þe dede bodies endelong þe pleyn. Til casuelly Troylus gan espie Þis Achilles, as he caste an eye, And gan his hors with spores to constreyne, And rood at hym with al his my?t &amp; peyne; But Achilles, of hym war also, Smette eke his stede &amp; made hym for to go Toward Troylus in þe silfe tyde. And with ful cours as þei to-gider ride Ful lyne ri?t, her speres sharpe whet, With swiche a my?t þei han to-gider met, Of hi?e disdeyn—þer is no more to seyn,— Þat to þe grounde þei fel boþe tweyne; But Achilles kau?te swiche a wounde In his body, so depe and so profounde, Þat long he lay (myn auctour seiþ certeyn) Or he to helþe restored was ageyn. And Troilus eke, þoru? platis, mail, and al (As writ Guydo) had a wounde smal, Whiche vn-to hym dide no greuaunce. And þus þat day by contynuaunce, And dayes sixe, swynge by and by, Þe proude Grekis mette cruelly Amyd þe feld hem of Troye toun, To gret damage and confusioun Of ouþer party, pleinly, þis no nay: For many worþi was slayn day by day In her rancour &amp; hertly hoot envie, —Al-be Guydo doth nat specefye Noon of her names, pleinly, in his boke, As ?e shal fynde ?if ?e list to loke. And al þis while, for þis sodeyn þing Pensyf &amp; trist was Priamus þe kyng, Þat Achilles torned hath so clene His hert away fro ?onge Polycene, And for þis chaunge, so sodeyn &amp; so newe, Þou?t his behestis wer[e] nat al trewe, But on deceit and on doubilnes, On fraude falsly, &amp; newfongilnes, On sle?ty tresoun and on couert gile, Or rage of loue, þat lasteth but a while, Was outterly founded his beheste: For like a wynde, þat no man may areste, Fareth a word, discordaunt to þe dede, Of whiche a wysman take shal noon hede, But lete passe, as he were rek[e]les. For, al-be-it þat þis Achilles Was whilom cau?t with-in Louys snare, Hym lyst nat now onys for to spare Of hy?e rancour his lady to offende— It was nat lyche as þei of Troye wende, Eccuba nouþer Pollycene. Wher-of Priam spak vn-to þe quene In an anger, and gan hir to abreide Þat she hir trust so enterely leyde On Achilles, þat can so falsly mene; Wherof ful trist was þis Polycene, Þat was inclined, with hir eyen clere, By þe counseil of hir moder dere To haue be wedded to þis Achilles, To fyn only þer shuld haue ben a pes Atwen Grekis and hem of Troye toun. Howe the next morowe Achilles resumede the sprete of rankoure and envye, and there-vpon, agayns the ordure of knyghthode, proditoriously compassede þe dethe of worthy Troylus. But al was fals, in conclusioun; In þe fyn was þe trouþe sene: For whanne Achilles of his woundes grene Was fully curid, by a certeyn day, He gan compasse, in al þat euere he may, And ymagyne in his envious herte To be venged of his woundis smerte Vp-on Troylus, þat stak ay in his mynde, At avauntage ?if he my?t hym fynde —To hym he bar so passyngly hatrede, In his herte brennynge as the glede, Whiche day nor ny?t may in no degre Fully be queynt til he avenged be, Þe hote rancour gan so on hym gnawe— Avised platly þat he shal be slawe Of his hondis, whan-so þat it falle. And on a day to hym he gan calle Mirundones, his kny?tes euerychon, Vp-on a morwe whan þe Grekis gon To-fore þe toun, in stel armyd bri?t, Ageyns Troyens in purpos for to fi?t; And þei wer come proudly in-to felde In thoposit, with many riche shelde, Newly depeynt with colours freshe &amp; fyne, Vp-on whiche ful bri?t[e] gan to shyne Firy Titan, gold-tressed in his spere, At his vprist with his bemys clere, —Whan þis felle envious Achilles To his kny?tes, called Mirundones, Vp-on Troylus gan hym to compleyne, Besechynge hem for to done her peyne Ageyn þis Troylus in þe feld þat day, To cachen hym at meschef ?if þei may, And besely to done her dilligence On hym to han her ful aduertence, By oon assent, wher-so þat he ride— Al oþer þing for to sette a-syde, And of nou?t ellis for to taken hede, Sauf finally ageyn hym to procede ?if þei my?t cacche hym in a trappe— With-Inne hem silf Troilus for to clap, To enclose and sette hym rounde aboute In al wyse þat he go nat oute. And whan he were be-set amonge hem alle, Nat to slen hym, what-so-euere falle, But þoru? her my?t manly hym conserue Til he hym silfe come &amp; make hym sterve, With his swerd, he &amp; noon oþer wy?t. Lo! here a manhod for to preise a-ri?t! Vengaunce of deth, of rancour, &amp; of pride, Compassid tresoun, kny?thod leyde a-side! Worþines be envie slawe, Falshed alofte, trouþe a-bak y-drawe! Allas! in armys þat it shulde falle, Of trecherie þat þe bitter galle Shuld in þis world in any kny?t be founde, Þat be to trouþe of her order bounde! Allas, allas! for now þis Achilles Conspired haþ with his Mirundones Þe deth of oon þe worþiest[e] wy?t Þat euere was, and þe beste kny?t! Allas! for wo myn herte I fele blede For his sake, þis story whan I rede. But whan Fortune haþ a þing ordeyned, Þou? it be euere wailled and compleined, Þer is no geyn nor no remedie Þou? men on it galen ay &amp; crye —I can no more touchinge þis matere, But write forþe, lik as ?e shal here, How Mirundones han her lord be-hi?t, With al her power &amp; her ful[le] my?t To fulfillen his comaundement; And in-to feld with Grekis þei be went. Howe Mirmidones grauntede Achilles to vmbilap Troilus, wherthorgh he myght the esylyer scle hym. But Troylus first, in þe opposit, Of verray kny?thood haþ so grete delit With-oute abood manly hem to mete —He was y-brent with so feruent hete Of hardines and [of] hi?e corage, Of worþines and of vasselage, Þat hym ne list no lenger to abide, But with his folk in be-gan to ride Amonge Grekis, þis stok of hi?e renoun. And with his swerd he woundeþ &amp; bereþ doun, Sleþ and kylleþ, vp-on euery halfe So mortally, þat þer may no salue Her sores sounde; for þer was but deth, Wher-so he rood, and ?elding vp þe breth, So furiously he gan hem enchase; And made hem lese in a litel space Her lond echon, and a-forn hym fle: In Troylus swerd þer was swiche cruelte, Þat maugre hem he þe feld haþ wonne. Þe same tyme whan þe bri?t[e] sonne Hi?e in þe south at mydday-marke shon, Euene at þe hour whan it drowe to noon, Whan Mirundones, gadred alle in oon, In compasse wyse rounde aboute hym gon, And furiously, of oon entencioun, Þei made a cercle aboute hym enviroun, Whan þei sawe him of help[e] desolaat. But he of hert nat disconsolat, Vp-on no side, þoru? his manlyhede Lik a lyoun toke of hem noon hede, But þoru? his famus kny?tly excellence As a tigre stondeth at diffence, And manfully gan hem to encombre, And [gan] to lasse &amp; discres her noumbre. And somme he maymeþ &amp; woundeþ to þe deþ, And somme he made to ?elden vp þe breþ, And somme he laide to þe erthe lowe, And somme he made for to ouer-þrowe, With his swerd of her blood al wet, At gret meschef under his horse fet;— Vp-on his stede sturdy as a wal, Þis worthy kny?t, þis man most marcial, Pleyeth his pley amonge Mirundones, Hym silf, God wote, allone al help[e]les. How worth[y] Troylus was besett with iij. thousande Knyghtes; and how knyghtly he defendid him. But þo, allas! what my?t his force avail Whan þre þousand kny?tes hym assail, On euery part, boþe in lengþe and brede! And cowardly first þei slow his stede With her speris, sharpe &amp; square [y-]grounde: For whiche, allas! he stont now on þe grounde With-oute reskus, refut, or socour, Þat was þat day of chiualrie flour. But, weillawey, þei han hym so be-set, Þat from his hed þei smet his basenet, And brak his harneis, as þei hym assaille, And seuere of stele þe my?ti strong[e] maille. He was disarmyd, boþe nekke and hed, Allas þe whyle! &amp; no wi?t toke noon hede Of alle his kny?tes longynge to þe toun; And ?it alweye þis Troyan champioun In kny?tly wyse, naked as he was, Hym silfe diffendeth, til Achilles, allas! Cam ridynge in, furious and wood. How worthy Troylus was cowardly slayn by Achilles. And whan he sawe how Troilus nakid stod, Of longe fi?tyng awaped and amaat, And from his folke allone disolat, Sool by hym silf at meschef pitously, Þis Achilles wonder cruelly, Be-hynde vnwarly, or þat he toke hed, With his swerd smyteþ of his hed, And cast it forþe of cursed cruel herte,— And þou?t[e] platly, it shuld him nat asterte To shewe his malys, þis wolfe vnmerciable! Ful vnkny?tly to be more vengable Vp-on þe body þat lay ded and colde —Allas, þat euer it shuld of kny?t be tolde, Wryte, or rehersed, to do so foule a dede, Or in a boke, allas, þat men shuld rede Of any kny?t a story so horrible, Vn-to þe eris passingly odible:— For þis Achille of cruelte, allas! Þe dede cors toke oute of þe taas, And vengably bond it, as I fynde, At þe taille of his hors be-hynde, And hatfully, þat euery wy?t behilde, Drowe it hym silf en[de]longe þe feld Þoru? þe rengis and þe wardis alle. How the translater compleyneth of Achilles for his treson, and deth of worthy Troylus. But, o allas! þat euere it shulde falle A kny?t to bene in herte so cruel, Or of hatred so dispitous fel To drawe a man after he were ded! O þou, Omer, for shame be now red, And be astonyd, þat haldest þi silfe so wyse, On Achilles to setten swiche a pris! In þi bokes for his chiualrie Above echon dost hym magnyfye, Þat was so slei?ty &amp; so ful of fraude! Whi ?evest þou hym so hi?e a pris &amp; laude? Certis, Omer, for al þin excellence Of rethoryk and of eloquence, Þi lusty songes and þi dites swete, Þin hony mouþe þat doth with sugre flete— ?et in o þing þou gretly art to blame: Causeles to ?eue hym swiche a name, With a title of triumphe and glorie So passingly putte hym in memorie, In þi bokes to seyn and write so, Þoru? his kny?thod he slowe Hectoris two: First hym þat was lik [vn-]to noon oþer, And Troilus after, þat was his owne broþer! ?if þou arte meved of affeccioun, Whiche þat þou hast to Grekis nacioun, To preise hym so, for þou canst endite, Þou shuldest ay, for any favour, write þe trouþe pleinly, &amp; ben indifferent, And seie þe soþe clerly of entent. For whan he slowe Hector in þe felde, He was a-forn disarmyd of his shelde And besy eke in spoylyng of a kyng: For ?if he had be war of his comyng, He had hym quytte, þoru? his chiualrie, His fals deceit and his trecherie, Þat he ne had so li?tly from hym gon. Troilus also was naked &amp; allone, Amyd foure þousand closed &amp; be-shet Whan Achilles haþ his hed of smet, At his bak of ful cruel herte, Whan he no þing his tresoun dide aduerte. Was þat a dede of a manly kny?t?— To slen a man forweried in fi?t, Feynt of travail, al þe longe day Amonge so many stondyng at abay, A kynges sone, and so hi?e born, Naked þe hed, his armure al to-torn, Euene at þe deth on þe silfe point, At disavauntage, &amp; pleinly oute of Ioynt, Of his lyf stondyng on þe wrak— Whan Achilles cam falsly at þe bak, Assaillynge hym whan he was half ded, And lyk a coward smot of þanne his hed, Þat was to-forn hurte &amp; wounded sore! Wherfor, Omer, preise hym now no more. Lat nat his pris þi rial boke difface, But in al haste his renoun oute [a]race: For his name whan I here nevene, Verrailly vp vn-to þe heuene (As semeth me) infect is þe Eyr, Þe sown þer-of so foule is &amp; vnfair! For ?if þat he had hadde his aduertence, Ouþer þe eye of his prouidence Vn-to kny?thod or to worþines, Ouþer to manhod or to gentilnes, Or to þe renoun of his owne name, Or to þe report of his kny?tly fame, In any wyse to haue taken hede, He hadde neuer don so foule a dede: So vengably [for] to haue y-drawe A kynges sone after he was slawe! And namly hym, þat was so gode a kny?t, Whiche in his tyme, who-so loke a-ri?t, Passed Achille, I dar it wel expresse, Boþe of manhod and of gentilnes. But for al þat, he is now ded, allas! Þe deth of whom whan Pallydamas And Paris eke dide first espie, Þei ferde, in soth, as þei wolde deye. And specially, with face ded and fade, Paris, allas, swiche a sorwe made For þe constreint of his dedly wo, Whan he sawe [þat] Troylus was a-go, And þat he shal neuer a-lyue hym se. Swiche sorwe also þe Troyan daun? Enee For hym hath made, &amp; many a-noþer mo. And alle attonys þei to-gidre go, Þe dede cors to recure ?if þei maye; But Grekis wern so fel on hem þat day Þat her labour was outterly in veyn, In any wyse þe cors to gete agey[n], Til þat Menoun, þe noble worþi kyng, Whiche loued Troilus ouer al[le] þing, Cau?t swiche routhe of affeccioun, Þat he in haste, ferser þanne lyoun, On his deth caste hym to be wreke. And first for Ire þus he gan to speke To Achilles for his hi?e tresoun: “O þou traitour! o þou scorpioun! O þou serpent, ful of trecherie! Whiche in dishonour of al chiualrie, Þoru? fals engyn hast þis day [y-]slawe Oon of þe best, þat hadde no felaw Whan he deide, in þis world a-lyve! Allas, allas! who may ari?t discrive Þi venym hid, þi malis &amp; vntrouþe, With-oute pite or, vnkny?tly, rouþe— To drawe a kny?t, so gentil &amp; so good, A kynges sone of so worþi blood, Þoru?-oute þe feld þin horse tail behinde, Þat after euer [it] schal ben in mynde, Þis cruel dede and vngentilnes!” And with þat word, Menoun gan him dresse Toward Achille, with-oute more arest; And with a spere smet hym in þe brest, Enviously of so grete hatrede, Þat he vnneþe kepte hym on his stede. And Menoun after pulled oute a swerde, And cast hym manly to [mete] hym in þe berde, And rood to hym, fully deuoide of drede, And swiche a wounde ?af him on þe hede, Þat maugre hym, in many mannys si?t, To þe erthe he made hym to ali?t, For al his pride, in a mortal traunce: For of þat wounde he felt[e] swiche greuaunce, Þat at þe deth he lay an huge whyle, In a swowe þe space of halfe a myle, Til Mirundones, assemblid in-to oon, With gret labour hent hym vp a-noon, Ful dedly pale, so he gan to blede. But for al þat, þei sette him on his stede, And at þe last his hert he kau?t ageyn, And smet his horse, of hate &amp; hi?e disdeyn, And toward Menoun faste gan hym hi?e. But whan þat he his comynge dide espie, Ful lyke a kny?t list nat to a-bide, But hit his horse sharply in þe side And mette Achilles proudly on þe plein; And with her swerdis þei to-gidre leyn, And gan to hurtle on horse-bak I-fere, With hert envious and dispitous chere. But kyng Menoun was at avauntage Of Achilles, for al his wode rage, In poynt tabrou?t hym to confusioun, Til þe wardis of newe come doun On ouþer part, boþe here &amp; ?onder, Whiche sodeinly seuered hem a-sonder. And as þe story telleth pleinly, þanne Be-gan þe slau?ter of many manly man: For nouþer party þe felde nolde leue Of verray pride, til it drow to eve, Þat Phebus gan aswagen of his hete, And gan to baþen, in þe wawes wete, His bri?t[e] bemys, of þe occian, Þat fro þe feld hom goth euery man To her loggyng; &amp; after, seuene daies Þei fau?t y-fere, &amp; made no delaies, Ful mortally, by cruel auenture, While Achilles besy was to cure His woundes grene, &amp; his soris sounde. And þanne he hath a newe tresoun founde, To be venged vp-on kyng Menon: For al his wit he sette þer-vppon. And so þis cruel envious Achilles I-charged hath his Mirundones Worthy Menon amonge hem to embrace, ?if þei hym founde in oportune place, With al her my?t and her besy þou?t— From her hondis þat he eskape nou?t Til he hym silfe avenged on hym be. And so bifel, as þei Menon se, Þe nexte morwe like a manly kny?t Ageyn þe Grekis armyd for to fi?t On Troye side as he was wont to do— Of auenture þat day it fil so, Þat Achilles and þis Menon mette: And eche of hem gan on oþer sette On horse-bak, of ful gret envie; And so longe in her malencolye, Myn auctor writ, þei to-gidre fi?t, Þat eche made oþer of force to ali?t. And whan Menon stood vpon þe grounde, Mirundones went aboute hym rounde, As þei wer charged of þe ferse Achille— Whan he, allas! with-oute Goddes wille, Disseuered was from his kny?tes alle. And at meschef þei vp-on hym falle, Destitut, allone, and help[e]les, And in swiche point slowe hym Achilles. But in þe story like as it is founde, Þis Menon first ?af hym swiche a wounde, To-forn his deth in al þis felle strif, Þat he dispeired was, pleinly, of his lyf— Þis Achilles, for al his false tresoun. Take hede, Omer, &amp; deme in þi resoun Þe false fraude and þe slei?ti gyle, Þe tresoun caste to-forn with many wyle Of Achilles; and Iuge now a-ri?t, ?if euere he slowe any worþi kny?t, But it were by prodicioun— Record I take of þe kyng Menoun: So þat þe title of his laude, allas, Entriked is with fraude &amp; with fallas, Þat þou, Omer, maist with no colour, Þou? þou peinte with gold &amp; with a?our, In þi writyng his venym nat enclose; But as þe þorn hid vnder þe rose, Whos malys ay dareth by þe rote, Þou? þe flour a-boue be fayr &amp; sote, Þat men þe fraude vnder may nat se— Of his tresoun ?e gete no more of me. The missauenture and discomforde that came amonges the Trogians after the deth of Troylus. But I wil telle how Grekis do þat day, —How Meneste and kyng Menelay, Dyomede and Thelamonyus On Troyens wern passyng dispitous: For cruelly with her wardis alle, In her meschef ben vp-on hem falle, And made hem fle hom vn-to þe toun. For whilom Troylus, þat was her champioun, Is ded, allas! &amp; hath hem now forsake. Of whom þei haue þe ded[e] body take Þe same day, wiþ gret diffyculte, And dolfully in-to þe cyte Þei han it brou?t, criyng ofte “allas!” And for his deth swiche a wo þer was, Þat I trowe þer is no man a-lyue Whiche koude ari?t haluendel discryue Her pitous wo nor lamentacioun: Certis not Boys, þat had[de] swiche renoun, With drery wordis to be-wepe and crye In compleynynge to philosophie, Þoru? his boke accusynge ay Fortune, Þat seld or nou?t can in oon contune— She is so ful of transmutacioun. O Stace of Thebes, make no bost nor soun Of drerinesse for to write at al, Nouþer of deth nor festis funeral, Of makyng sorwe nor aduersite; Late be þi wepynge, o þou Nyobe, ?e suster also of Melleager, Þat custom han for to fle so fer, From ?er to ?ere ?oure broþer to compleyne; And þou þat weptist oute þin eyen tweyne, Edippus, kyng of Thebes þe cyte, Þou woful Mirre, and Calixtone, Þat so wel can in rage ?ou be-mene, And Dido eke, of Cartage quene,— Lat be ?oure dool and contricioun! And Philis eke, for þi Demephoun, And Echcho eke, þat now dost be-gynne To crie &amp; waille, &amp; also þou Corrynne, Þat whilom were in so gret affray For deth only of þi popyngay, As in his boke telleþ vs Ouyde,— Late al þis wo now be leide a-side, And make of hit no comparisoun Vn-to þe wo þat was in Troye toun For deth only of þis worþi kny?t! For loue of whom, euery maner wi?t, Hi?e &amp; lowe, olde &amp; ?onge of age, Are falle of newe in-to swiche a rage Þat þei coude of her wo noon ende; Whos salt[e] teris wil her eyen shende, So pitous was þe lamentacioun In euery strete þoru?-oute al þe toun. Allas! who koude al her sorwes telle?— I trowe, certis, Pluto depe in helle, For al his torment &amp; his peynes kene— Nouþer she, Proserpina his quene, Nouþer þe wery wode Tycyus, Ixioun, nor hungri Tantalus Ne coude nat, for al her bitter peyne, So furiously wepen &amp; compleyne As don Troyens, Troylus, for þi sake. For who can now swiche a sorwe make, Or who can wepe as kyng Priamus? Who wepeth now, with face ful pitous, Or maketh sorwe but Eccuba þe quene? Who wepeth now but faire Polycene? Who wepeth now but Paris &amp; Eleyne? Who can now wepe or in-to teris reyne As do Troyens, with dedly swolle chere? It neded hem no wepers for to here,— Þei hadde I-nowe of her owne stoor, Allas, for now þei ben for euermor Of helpe al sool, of counfort destitut. For who shal now ben to hem refut, Now þat Hector and also Dephebus And Troylus eke, þat was so vertuous, Be dede, allas!—who shal her socour be, Or sustene þe werre of her cyte? Þer is no more, in conclusioun, But after deth fully destruccioun Of her touris and her wallis stronge. In þis mater what shulde I pleyne longe?— It vailleth nat alweye so to mourne, Wherfore, I wil new ageyn retourne To my mater, and telle how þe kynge To Grekis haþ, with-oute more tariynge, For a trewe and a pes y-sent, A certeyn tyme, by gret avisement, Whiche graunted was of Agamenoun. And whan þei were repeired to þe toun, Kyng Priamvs dide his besy cure For to make a riche sepulture For Troylus cors, ful noble and rial, As seith Guydo, of stonys &amp; metal, And hym enclosed, of gret affectioun. And ny?e beside was þe kyng Menoun Solemnely buried and y-graue. And after þat, day by day þei haue, Lyke þe custom, of festis funeral And oþer ritys Ceremonyal, For hem boþe, with due obseruaunce, Seruyse doon by contynuaunce In her temple, lyk as was þe gyse, Whiche were to longe me [for] to deuyse, And tedius eke for ?ou to dwelle. How Achilles was slayne by Paris in the Temple of Apollo, by the deuice [of] Eccuba þe quene. But I purpose ceriously to telle How Eccuba, as I can endyte, Hir caste fully Achilles to quyte His tyranny, sothly, ?if she may. And vn-to hir she calleth on a day Alysaundre, in ful secre wyse, And vn-to hym, as I shal deuyse, With wepynge eyen &amp; ful heuy chere Seide euene þus, lyk as ?e shal here: “Parys,” quod she, “allas, sauf Goddis wille, Þou knowest wel how þe ferse Achille My sonys hath slay[e]n ny?e echon— Þer is non lefte but þi silf allone: He hath me made (allas, þer is no geyn) Ful cowardly, of children now bareyn— Boþe of Hector &amp; Troylus eke þer-to, Whiche were to me in euery trouble &amp; wo Fully counfort, plesaunce, and solace. Wherfore, I caste pleynly to compasse, By som engyn his deth to ordeyne; And lyke as he by tresoun dide his peyne, Traytourly with his swerd to smyte, Ri?t so, I þink, with tresoun hym to quyte, As sittyng is of ri?t and equyte. And sith þou wost pleynly how þat he Hath sette his herte &amp; his loue clene On my dou?ter, ?onge Polycene, To fyn only to hauen hir to wyve— For whiche I caste to hym sende blyve For to come and trete of þat mater In þe temple of Appollo here— In þe temple, most chef of þis cite. Whiche tyme, my wil is þat þou be Þi siluen armyd þer ful priuely, With certeyn kny?tes in þi company, Armyd also ageyn þe same day, Þat in no wyse he skape nat a-way From ?our hondis, but þat he be ded, As I haue seid; and þerfor take good hed Vn-to þis þing, with al myn herte, I praie, Fro point to point my biddyng to abeie.” And he assenteþ with al his hool[e] herte, Behotyng hir he shulde nat asterte. And with hym toke twenty &amp; no mo Of manly men, þat wel durste do; And in þe temple, by ful good avys, Þei wern y-hyd by byddyng of Paris, While Eccuba, couert in hir entent, Hir Messager to Achilles hathe sent, As ?e han herde, in conclusioun, To come in haste vn-to Troye toun After þeffect was of hir message, Only to trete for a mariage. And he in haste cometh at hir sonde, As he þat koude no þing vndirstonde Hir tresoun hid, nor pleinly it aduerte: He was so hote marked in his herte With Louys brond &amp; his firy glede, Of lyf nor deth þat he toke noon hede, But sette a-side wit and al resoun, To caste a-forn by gode discrecioun What was to do, with lokyng ful prudent. But he, in soth, was with love blent, In-to Troye w[h]an he shulde goon, Lyke as it fareth of lovers euerychon: Whanne þei haue kau?t in herte a fantasie, For no pereil, þou? þei shuld[e] deye, Þei haue no my?t nor power to be ware, Til þei vnwarly be trapped in þe snare, Her maladie is so furious. And þus Achilles and Anthilogus, Nestoris sone, han þe weye nome Toward þe toun, &amp; ben to-gidre come In-to [þe] temple, as ?e han herd me telle. And Paris þo list no lenger duelle, But, vnwarly, with his kny?tes alle On Achilles is at meschef falle, Eueryche of hem with a swerd ful bri?t. And somme bokis seyn it was by ny?t, Whan his deth, longe a-forn desired, By Eccuba &amp; Paris was conspired. But Achilles in þis mortal caas, Amonge hem alle, naked as he was, Hent oute a swerde in þe silve steuene, And like a kny?t he slow of hem seuene Of verray force, maugre al her my?t. But whan Paris þer-of hadde a si?t, Þre dartes rau?t þat were kene &amp; square, And sodeinly, or þat he was ware, Ful secrely hid vnder þe shade, Markyng at hym, &amp; no noyse made, Caste at hym euene as euere he can, Þat hed &amp; shafte þoru? his body ran; And þer-with[-al] kny?tes nat a fewe With sharp[e] swerdis gan vp-on him hewe, And left hym nat til he lay at grounde Ful pale ded, with many mortal wounde. And ri?tfully, of resoun as it sit, Þus was þe fraude &amp; þe falshede quit Of Achilles, for his hi?e tresoun: As deth for deth is skilfully guerdoun And egal mede, with-outen any fable, To hem þat be merciles vengable. For þilke day, Guydo writeþ þus, Þat Achilles and Anthilogus Of Paris wern in þe temple slawe; And afterward þe body was out drawe Of Achille fro þe holy boundis, And cruelly þrowen vn-to houndis To be deuourid in þe brode strete, Þe canel rennynge with his wawes wete— With-oute pite or any maner routhe. Loo! here þe ende of falshed &amp; vntrouþe, Loo! here þe fyn of swiche trecherie, Of fals deceit compassid by envie! Loo! here þe knot and conclusioun, How God quyt ay slau?ter by tresoun! Loo! here þe guerdoun &amp; þe final mede Of hem þat so deliten in falsehede: For euery þing, platly for to seyne, Like as it is, his guerdoun doth atteyne, As ?e may se of þis Achilles, Whiche on a ny?t in þe temple les His lyf; for he was ay customable By fraude &amp; tresoun for to be vengable. But it befel, at request of Eleyne, Þat þe bodies of þis ilke tweyne Conservid wern from þe hungri rage Of best and foule, gredy &amp; ramage. And ?it þe[i] laie amyddes þe cite Ful openly, þat men my?t [hem] se, To gret[e] gladnes to hem of þe toun, In-to tyme þat Agamenoun To kyng Priam sent his massageris To haue licence to fet hem hom on beris; By graunt of whom þei han þe corsis take. For whom Grekis swiche a sorwe make, Þat pite was and routhe for to here. And eueryche spake þus vn-to his fere: “Fare wel oure trust, now Achilles is dede! Fare wel oure hope, &amp; holly al our spede! Fare wel oure Ioye, &amp; oure chef diffence, Þat had in manhod so gret excellence! Fare wel, allas! oure souereyn assuraunce! Fare wel in kny?thod al oure suffisaunce, For now, allas! vnlikly is þat we Shal euere wynne or geten þis cite— To vs, allas, so frowarde is fortune!” But for þat þei my?t[e] nat contune Alweye in wo, nor in peyne endure, Þei maked han a riche sepulture To Achilles of stonys precious, And a-noþer to Anthilogus. What shuld I now any lenger dwelle Ceriously þe rytis for to telle Of her buriyng?—nor what wo þei make?— Her wepyng al, nor of her cloþes blake, Nor how somme louren in her hood, And how somme go with mylke &amp; blood, With doolful herte, &amp; in-to fire it shede?— And how oþer caste gommys swete Amyd þe grete flawme funeral, Nor of þe pleies called palestral, Nor þe wrastelyng þat was at þe wake?— It were but vein me to vndirtake To tellen al; wher-fore I lete be, Fully in purpos, like as ?e shal se, To resorte, in conclusioun, To telle how þe grete Agamenoun For his lordis in al hast haþ sent. And whan þei wern assemblid in his tent, Ful prudently þis kyng, þis manly man Wiþ gret avis þus his tale began: How the Grekes, after that Achilles was slayne, toke their councell to fecche Pirrus his son. “Sirs,” quod he, “Fortunys variaunce, Hir cher fraward &amp; dowble countenaunce, And sodeyn torn of hir false visage ?oure hertis-hath putte in swich a rage For þe mordre, to God &amp; man odible, Of Achilles, cruel and orible, By compassyng of Eccuba þe quene. Now semeth me þat it shal be sene ?if any manhod in ?oure hertis be, Or kny?tly force, in aduersite For tendure by vertu of sufferaunce, Til of his deth ?e take may vengaunce, And manly quyte þis outragous offence, Whan tyme cometh to make recompence. But sith þat ?e be manly and prudent, I wolde first se þe pleyn entent In þis mater of ?ow þat be so wyse, Here-vppon what is ?oure a-vyse, By oon assent &amp; voys in comwne: Wher þat ?e wil þe werre forþe contune, And þe sege [y-]gonne vppon þis toun, Til þei be brou?t to confusioun,— Or in-to Grece now resorte ageyn For cause only [þat] Achilles is slayn, Þat whilom was ?oure stronge champioun, ?oure diffence and proteccioun,— But finally now þat he is dede: Here-vppon, late se what is ?oure rede— Seith openly, and no lenger tarie.” And somme anon gonne for to varie And to grucche, castynge to and fro, Stondynge in doute what wer best to do. And some seide, on þe toþer syde, For lyf or deth þei wolde an ende abide. And somme of hem þat of wit were rude, For her party gonne to conclude, Þat þei wold home ageyn retourne. And oþer seide þat þei wil soiorne Stille at þe sege, hap what hap[pe] may. And þus þei treten al þe longe day, Euery man like his oppinioun, Til at þe laste, in conclusioun, Þei ben accorded fully in-to oon, Fro þe sege neuer for to goon Vn-to þe tyme þei haue of þe toun Þoru? her kny?thod ful possessioun, At her fre wil to spillen and to saue, Al-be Achilles was buried &amp; y-graue. For þe trust of euery worþi kny?t Was finally, as goddes han be-hi?t, Þat þei in hast shal þe toun possede: Þis was hir hope, fully deuoide of drede, Vndispeired in ther oppinioun. And þanne anoon Aiax Thelamoun, A worþi kny?t, &amp; famus of his hond Among alle þo of þe Grekis lond, Seide euene þus, pleinly in sentence: “Sirs,” quod he, “þat ben here in presence, My counseille is, platly, &amp; my red, Now it stant so þat Achilles is ded, For his sone in al haste to sende Heder to come for to sen an ende Of þe sege, and helpe vs in þis nede, Whiche now abit with kyng Lycomede, His bisaiel; and named is Pirrus. And some hym calle Neptolonyus, Ri?t lusty, fresshe, &amp;, by liklynes, Able to atteyne to gret worþines, As þe report &amp; þe fame is kouthe, ?if he him drawe to armys in his ?ouþe. And sothfastly, but if bokes lye, As I have red &amp; herd by prophesye, Þat finally Troye þe cyte With-outen hym shal neuere wonne be— Þus bokes seyn, þat ben of olde memorie— And how Grekis shal haue no victorie Til he come, þis sone of Achilles: Wherfore, in haste, &amp; beth nat rek[e]les, Sendeth for hym, þat it be don anon.” And þei commende his conseil euerychon, And to his red fully hem assent. And by avys ful prudently þei sent In al haste on þis embassiat Þe wyse kyng, ful famus of estat,— I mene [þe] prudent noble Menelay. And forþe he goth þe silfe same day, And on his Iourne gan him fast[e] spede Til þat he cam vn-to Lycomede, Þe olde kyng, as ?e han herd me telle, Wher for a tyme I wil leue him dwelle, And to Grekis in þe mene whyle, So as I can, directe ageyn my stile. How the Grekes held a great batayle agay[n]st the Troyans; and how duke Meneste slew Polidamas, a troyen knyght; and how Paris slew kynge Thelamon with an arowe. The tyme of ?er whan þe shene sonne In þe Crabbe had his cours I-ronne To þe hi?est of his ascencioun, Whiche called is þe somer stacioun, Whan þe vertu oute of euery rote Is drawen vp, and þe bawme soote In-to þe croppe; &amp; þe freshe floure Moste lusty is of hewe &amp; of coloure, Til Phebus chare, in his discencioun, Oute of þe Crabbe toward þe Lyoun Holdeth his course in þe firmament— I mene whan he is retrogradient, And drieþ vp þe moysture &amp; þe weete Of herbe &amp; floure with his feruent hete; And al þat ver a-forn him made grene, To whyte he turneth with his bemys shene— Boþe seed and greyn be decoccioun: For naturelly by digestioun, Þat first was raw in fruitis &amp; in flouris, And watrie eke be plente of humours, He drieth vp and ripeth at þe fulle With his feruence, þat men may hem pulle, Eche in his kynde, after þe sesoun, Fro ?er to ?er by reuolucioun, On her braunchis freshely as þei sprede: Whan þat cheries plowbly ben &amp; rede, First in Iune, þat sweth after May, Whan þe hote mery somers day No dwery is, but like a geant longe— Þe same tyme, þe Grekis, stoute &amp; stronge, With rancour brent of her envious hete, Hath shapen hem with her foon to mete; And bri?t armed in-to þe feld þei go. And þei of Troye oute of þe toun also, With her wardis ordeyned euerychon, Þe feld haue take to mete with her foon, And gan tassemble vp-on ouþer syde. But Thelamoun, of foly and of pride, Þe same day (of hym as I rede), As he þat had of his deth no drede, Disarmed was for batail of a-reste, Of mail and plate bare vp-on þe brest: For of foly and surquedous outrage, Bare his hed, and bare eke his visage, And bare also, with-oute basenet, And naked eke of viser and palet He rood alday, of no þing afferd, Havyng no wepene but a naked swerd. For wilfully he left at home his shelde And his spere whan he toke þe feld, Ful lyk a kny?t sittynge on his stede. And after hym folweth Dyomede, Like Mars hym silfe, aboute him his meyne, And faste by cam duke Meneste, Kyng Vlixes, and Agamenoun. And Priamus with hem of Troye toun Toke eke þe feld, with a ful hevy chere: For he was boþe ferful &amp; in were, In gret dispeire and inly ful of drede To issen out, now Hector was dede— Worþi Troylus and also Dephebus— For in hym silfe he dempte pleynly þus: Þat he was febled gretly of his my?t With-oute hem with Grekis for to fi?t; But oute he goth, hap what hap[pe] may, And Parys eke, ful kny?tly of array, Kyng Philymene and Pollydamas, Worþi Esdre, and with hym Eneas— By oon assent, þer is no more to seie, Þe same day, kny?tly to lyue or deye In her diffence, and outerly iuparte, As goddes list, þe felde to departe. And proudly first þe Grekes þei gan perce; And Paris þo, with hem þat wern of Perce, Fil in a-side wiþ þe sonne shene; And his archeris with arowes square &amp; kene Þe Grekis gan assondre to disseuere: For in þe feld þei my?t[e] not perseuere, Only for shot of þe strong archeris Of Perce lond, and þe arblasteris, Whiche made hem fle, ri?t of verray nede, In-to þe tyme þat proude Diomede, Whan he of Grekis saw þe sodeyn fli?t, Hem to releue, lyk a manly kny?t Is come vppon felly in his tene. And first of al he sette on Phylymene, A worþi kyng, þat cam on Troye syde; Þe whiche ageyn gan at hym [to] ride, Þat Diomede hath but litel wonne, With swerdis stif as þei to-geder ronne— Þat to behold it was a noble si?t, How eche of hem quyt hym like a kny?t, As þei to-gider ran on horse-bak, Þat no man koude in nouþer se no lak. But euere in on Troyens were so felle Vp-on Grekis, þat þei ne my?t[e] dwelle To kepe her lond, so þei made hem blede, Maugre þe force of þis Diomede. Þe slau?ter was so hidous &amp; so strong, Þat þoru? þe feld þe woful noyse rong, And mortal cry of wounded folke þat lay Slayn on þe soyl, endelong þe way,— Til Meneste, sittynge on his stede, Þe worþi duke, gan to taken hede In what meschef Grekis were be-set, And hent anoon a spere sharp[e] whet, Smytynge hys hors felly in þe side; And þoru? þe rengis kny?tly he gan ride, And stint[e] nat, so furious he was, Til þat he mette with Pollydamas, A Troyan kny?t and a manly man; And vnwarly, at hym as he ran, He hitte hym so, in many mannes si?t, To þe erþe þat he made hym a-li?t; And with a swirde, at grounde whan he lay, He hadde him slawe þe silfe same day In his rage and his cruel tene, Nadde only be þat kyng Phylymene Had hym reskwed in þis auenture, Which so frendly for hym dide his cure, Maugre þe my?t of þis Meneste, From his hondis þat he went[e] fre, Al forbaþed &amp; be-spreint with blood. And al þis while Aiax proudly rood, Of surquedie and of wilfulnes, Of foly rage and foule hardynes, Naked his body, hed, and euerydel, Amyd his foon armed bri?t in stele, And of Troyens swiche a slau?ter made Þat þei lay dede, boþe in sonne &amp; shade, Þoro?-oute þe feld, where þis Thelamoun Amonge hem rod woder þan lyoun— Þat Troyen noon my?t[e] hym withstonde While þat he held his blodi swerd in hond, Þat wonder was, naked as he rood, With-oute wounde þat he so longe a-bood. And, as Guydo makeþ rehersaille, And writeþ eke for a gret mervaille, Þat he vnslayn my?t[e] so contune: But whan a þing is shapen of Fortune, It mote be-falle, what-euere þing it be, In wele or wo, Ioye or aduersite— Whan oon shal deye or whan he shal eskape. But she, allas! can alder-best be-iape, And bring a man vnwarly to meschaunce Whan he best weneth to han assuraunce In þis lady of transmutacioun, Lik as it fil of worþi Thelamoun Þis same day, whiche of foly pride Amonge his foon gan so fer to ride, I-liche freshe, ri?t as he be-gan, And slowe of Perce many manly man, And of hym silfe toke no maner hede, His kny?tly hert so voyde was of drede. Til Paris sawe his gret[e] hardines, And how þat he his kny?tes dide oppresse, Enchasyng hem so mortally &amp; narwe: With-oute abood anon he toke an arwe, Entoxicat, sharpe, &amp; venemous, And in his Ire fel and despitous, And shet at hym in þe silfe tyde, As seith Guydo, and smet hym þoru? þe side, Þat of þat hurte—þer is no more to seie— He felte wel þat he muste deye. And whan he sawe noon oþer remedie, Forþe he rood, supprised with envie, Þoru?-oute þe pres, his swerd ay in his hond, In-to tyme þat he Paris fonde, And vn-to hym, with a pale chere, He seide þus, anon as ?e shal here: How Kyng Thelamon, after that he had his dethes wounde of Paris, Slew Paris after, with a sworde. “Parys,” quod he, “as þis mortal wounde Of þin arwe, sharpe &amp; square y-grounde, Hath finally my lyf put in dispeire, Neuere in-to Grece for to han repeire, Ri?t so shal I, be short conclusioun, A weye shape, þat in-to Troye toun With þi lyf þou entre shalt no more, At myn hert þe venym bit so sore, Þat oþer geyn is þer noon but deth. But ?it to-forn or I ?elde vp þe breth, Trust me ri?t wel, þer may be no socour, Þat þou shalt first be my predecessour And gon a-forn, depe doun in helle, Þer with Pluto eternally to dwelle, So as of ri?t it is necessarie: Þe tyme is set, whiche may nat tarie, And my trouþe for morgage in depos, Þat in al haste I shal make a dyvos Atwixe þe and þe quene Eleyne, And twynne assonder eke þe false cheyne Whiche lynked was by colour of wedlok, And hath so longe be shet vnder loke Only by fraude &amp; false engyn also. But now þe knot shal be broke a-two, With my ri?t hond, þe trouþe to darreyne; For þoru? cause only of ?ow tweyne, In þis werre many worþi kny?t His lyf hath lost, &amp; many an-oþer wy?t, On ouþer side, for ?oure boþe sake. But of al þis I shal an ende make— Of ?oure loue &amp; foule avoutr[i]e: For, finally, Paris, þou shalt dye Of myn hondis, as it is þi chaunce!” And with þat word his swerd he gan enhaunce A-boue his hed, &amp; smet hym in þe face, Þat he fil ded in þe silve place; For his hed he parted hath on tweyne. And ri?t furþe-with, þer is no more to seyne, Aiax, allas, of his mortal wounde Fil ded also, gruf vn-to þe grounde Ful pitously; &amp; þanne þei of Troye Han Paris take vp oute of þe woye, And bare hym hom in-to her cite. But Diomede &amp; duke Meneste, With many Greke ridynge enviroun, Swen þe chaas euene to þe toun; But for cause Titan gan to lowe, Doun by þe arche of his daies bowe Fer in-to weste, vnder þe rowes rede, And Espirus gan his li?t to shede —Þis to seyn, for it drowe to ny?t,— Þe Grekis ben repeired anoon ri?t, Eueryche of hem to his loggynge place To take her reste al þat ny?tes space— Saue, as I rede, þat Agamenoun Þe Grekis made fast[e] by þe toun To sette her tentis and papillyouns, Habitacles, and newe mansiouns, Of verray pride faste by þe wal. And þei of Troye, dispeired oueral, No refut koude Grekis for to lette, But of assent fast her gates shette, And al þe ny?t on þe wallis wake, And ouere þis, swiche a wo þei make Þoru? þe cite, þat Paris was so ded; For, finally, now þei can no red, But wepe &amp; crye &amp; sorwern euere in oon, Now alle þe sonys of Priamus wer goon! Fortune, allas! hath hem so appeired, Þat of her lyf þei ben dis[es]peired, Of al hope and of good welfare— Perpetuelly for to lyue in care Vn-to her deth; and þat was fast[e] by: For now þer is no maner remedie Vp-on no syde, nor refut noon at al, But hem to kepe clos with-Inne wal, Þat for to sen it was a pitous þing. And swiche a wo makeþ now þe kyng For Paris deth, þat for dedly smerte Hym þou?t[e] platly þat his sorful herte Recurles wold[e] riue a-tw[e]yne; And in-to terys he gan stille and reyne, As he wolde for verray sorwe deye. And of þe quene, allas! what shal I seye, Eccuba his owne moder dere, Þat crieth, wepeth with a woful chere— Of Polycene, þat was so wo-be-goon, And of his sustren also euerychoon, Þat han her heer &amp; her cloþes torn, As þei had her owne deth [y-]sworn, For drery wo, and for pitous peyne. But for-by alle, þe faire quene Eleyne Wailleth, crieth wiþ a dedly chere, Þat her eyen, whiche whilom wer so clere, For-dirked wern with doolful teris smerte. And to þe cors sodeynly she sterte, And clippid it in hir armys tweyne, And pitously enbrace it and restreyne, Like as she wolde with hym dye anoon; For stille she lay, dowmbe as any stoon, As marbil cold, hir lymys cravmpisshing, Redy at al toward hir buriynge, Til men by force from þe cors hir hente; And she hir heer &amp; hir chekes rente, As she wer fallen in a rage, Þat changed was, allas! in hir visage Hir natif colour and hir rody hewe, Whilom as fresche as any rose newe: Now is she like vn-to asshes colde; And with hir hondis, ay to-gider folde, Hir silfe she smot on hir pale face; And euere amonge þe cors she dide enbrace, In hir swowes as she fil to grounde, Twenty tyme, and wepte ful his wounde. With wo she was so waped and amaat, Of al counfort, allas! disconsolat, In herte beyng inly desirous, Þoru? hir rage passyng furious, To deye attonys with hir owne kny?t; And toward deth enclosid was hir si?t, As she þat lyst to lyve now no more. I trow[e] þat neuer man be-fore No woman sawe falle in swiche distresse, In swiche disioint of dedly hevynes, Nor for no wo so pitously raue: Nat Cleopatre goynge to hir graue, Nor woful Tesbe, þat fro þe kave sterte, Whan she hir silfe smote vn-to þe herte, Nor þe feithful trewe Orestille, Whan þat she sawe hir lord ageyn hir wille, Marcus Plancus, vn-to shipe goon, And for his love fil doun ded anon, Nor þe sorwe of trewe Iulya, Nor þe feruence of feithful Porcia, Of whiche þe ton fil ded sodeynly, For she sawe blood spreint so cruelly On hir lordis dredful garnement, And Porcia, so trewe in hir entent, Whan þat hir lord Brutus lost his lyf, For be-cause she my?t haue no knyfe, Wiþ colys rede slowe hir silfe, allas! Was nat also in þe silfe caas Arthemysya, quene of Tarse lond?— Of Mausolus þe graue whan she fond, Hir owne kny?t, of whos bonis smale, Ful wofully, &amp; with a cher ri?t pale, She powder made, &amp; drank it euery morwe. But al þe wo and þe furious sorwe Of þese echon ?et may nat atteyne Vn-to þe sorwe of þe quene Eleyne, Þat finally wil hir silfe for-do For Paris sake, whom she loued so: For after hym she wil nat lyve a day, But ben awreke, pleynly, ?if she may, Vp-on hir lyf rather þanne disseuere. And þus in wo ay she doth perseuere, In hir hert Paris sat so depe. Allas! who seith wommen can nat wepe!— ?et dout[e]les þei haue it of nature, Þou? it so be þat þei no wo endure, ?it can þei feyne and salt[e] teris fynde, Plente y-nowe, of her owne kynde, And sorweles mornen and compleyne. I seie nat þis for þe quene Eleyne, Þat was with wo wounded to þe herte, Þat fro þe deth she wend[e] nat a-sterte; For deþis darte hir herte made ryve, And ?it she roos ageyn fro deth to lyve, Only by grace, for al hir fel[le] rage: For euery wo by processe muste aswage, And ouergon and wasten by myracle; For eche venym maked is triacle, And euery wo hath his remedie. For þou? Eleyne fayn[e] wolde die, Hir kynde nolde assent[e] ?et þer-to, So sodeinly to slen hir silfe for wo: She was a womman, no man shuld her wyte! Me liste no more of hir wo endite, List vn-to ?ou þat it were tedious To heren alle hir peynes furious, Hir cruel wo and lamentacioun, Whiche wold[e] meve to compassioun, In verray soth—to writen euerydel— Any herte þou? it were made of stel. For kyng Priam and þe quene also Hadden swiche routh of her pitous wo, To sene hir so wepen and compleyne, Þat for hir þei felt as moche peyne As þei dide al-most for Paris. Her-of no more: for Priam by devys, After þis rage and þis mortal wo, Amyd þe temple sacrid to Iuno Ordeyned hath, wiþ ful besy cure, For þe cors a riche sepulture, And in al haste þer-in made it shette, Þat in sothnes ?iffe I shulde lette To tellen al þe ritis and þe guyse Þat þer wer made in her peynym wyse, And þe costis of his buriynge, It shuld[e] be to longe a tariynge, Ceriously þer-on to abyde, Wherfore, as now I lete ouerslyde Her peynym ritys supersticious. How Kyng Pryam kepte the Citee of Troye, And durste no lengere holde Batayle agaynst the Grekes; and how the quene of Ama?onis came, with other of her ladies, to helpe the Troyans. And telle I wil how kyng Priamus Commaunded haþ, of meschef &amp; of nede, Þoru? Troye toun, only of verray drede, To shette her gatis strongly as þei may, And þer-vppon, boþe ny?t and day To kepe wache: for, shortly, þei of Troye, Disconsolat of al her olde Ioye, Can no refut, but wepe and sorwe make; For þei ne durst no more vndirtake Ageyn Grekis in-to feld to goon. Til on a day kyng Agamenoun His messager by good avisement To Priamus in-to Troye hath sent, Requeryng hym, of manhod like a kny?t, To issen oute with Grekis for to fi?t, As he was wont, with his chiualrie. But kyng Priam his axyng gan denye, And shortly seide to hym þat was sent, Þat he ne wolde at his assygnement Nat onys passe þe gatis of þe toun, But at his owne fre eleccioun, Whan-euere hym list, with outen compellyng. And ?it, in soth, cause of his tariynge Was for þe hardy quene of Femynye Toward Troye faste gan hir hi?e Oute of hir lond, a litel regioun, Þe whiche, as bokis make mencioun, After þe syyt of þe firmament Is in þe plage of þe orient, And called is þe regne of Ama?onys, Of whiche þe custom[e] &amp; þe wone ys, Þat only wommen þer-in shal abide: And þei ar wont armyd for to ryde, And han in armys gret experience; For her labour &amp; her dilligence Is finally to hauen excersyce Fro day to day in Martis hi?e seruyse. And ouer-more, her custom and vsaunce, As to þis day is maked remembraunce, Is þat no man shal hem ny?e ner, But ?if it be þre monþes in þe ?er: Þis to seyn, In Iune, April, &amp; May; And þan þe wommen han in custom ay Vn-to an yle a litel þer be-syde, Wher as þe men by hem silfe abide Fro ?ere to ?ere to-gidre euerychon, Vn-to þe men oute of her lond to gon, And þere abide in þat regioun Til tyme cometh of concepcioun, With-oute tariynge any lenger while; For þanne anoon home vn-to her Ile Þei repeire oute of þat contre Vn-to tyme þat þei delyuered be. And as faste as þe childe is born, For lak of kepynge þat it be nat lorn, He fostrid is, til þre ?ere be a-goon, Amonge þe wommen; &amp; þanne ri?t anon To þe Ile besiden adiacent, Vn-to þe men þe childe in haste is sent, ?if þat it be of kynde masculyn. And ?if it falle þat it be femynyn, With þe wommen abide stille it shal Til þat it be in actis marcial Ful wel experte, &amp; þat she can eke knowe To handle a spere or to drawe a bowe, Lyke þe statutis of þat regioun, Þe whiche, as bokes make mencioun, Is set be-twene Ewrope &amp; Asya. And of þis lond was Pantysyllya Whilom lady and gouerneresse, Ful renomed of strengþe &amp; hardynes Þoru?-oute þe world, boþe in lengþe &amp; brede; And ?it, in soth, to speke of wommanhede, For al her my?t she had an huge pris, For boþe she was vertuous and wys, Wonder discret, &amp; had an honest name, Nat-withstondynge þe excelle of fame Of hir renoun in armys and þe glorie: For of conquest and of hi?e victorie She was most surmovntyng, out of drede, Of any womman þat I can of rede; And, sothly, ?it bokes bere witnesse, Of wommanhede and of gentilnesse She kepte hir so þat no þinge hir a-sterte. Þe whiche loued with al hir hool[e] herte Worþi Hector, and with al her my?t, Only for he was so noble a kny?t, Þat hir Ioye &amp; worldly plesaunce, Hir hertly ese &amp; souereyne soffisaunce, In verray soth, where she wake or winke, Was euere in oon vp-on hym to þinke, Of verray feith, with-outen any slouþe. And vn-to hym she was be bond of trouþe, Confederat of olde affeccioun, Þat whan she herd how þat Troye toun Besegid was of þe Grekis felle, Þis hardy quene liste no lenger dwelle, But hasteth hir, as fast as euere she may, Toward Troye in ful good array With alle þe worþi wommen of hir londe, Ful wel expert &amp; preved of her honde, Wel horsed eke, and armed richely. And, as I fynde, in her company, A þousand maidenes ridinge by her side, Þis worþi quene, þat durst[e] wel abide, She with hir brou?t, in steel armyd bri?t, For loue of Hector, hir owne trewe kny?t. And on hir weie fast she gan hir spede To helpen hym ?if she seie nede: For in no þinge she koude hir more delite Þanne towarde hym feithfully hir quyte, For þat was al hir lust &amp; hertis Ioye. But whan þat she comen was to Troye, And herde telle by relacioun Þat he was ded, most worþi of renoun, To whom she was so lovinge &amp; so trewe, Anoon she gan to chaungen cher and hewe, And pitously for to wepe &amp; crye, And ferd in soth as she wold[e] deye For verray wo and hertly hevynes, And þou?t she wold þoru? hir worþines Avenge his deth, platly, ?if she may, On þe Grekis; and so vppon a day She preieth Priam, with gret affeccioun, For to oppene þe gatis of þe toun, And to gon oute with Grekis for to fi?t Þat þei may knowe &amp; be expert ari?t Of þis womman þe grete worþines, And of þis quene þe famous hardines. And so þe kyng, hopynge for þe beste, With-oute abood graunted hir requeste Þe nexte morwe, whan Phebus shon ful shene; And al to-forn out goth Phylymene, Þe noble kyng, with hem of Paffaganye; And after hym oþer kny?tes manye Folwed after with worþi Eneas, Þe Troyan eke, daun? Pallydamas. And þanne þe quene Pantasyllya By þe gate called Dardanyca Toward Grekis proudly Issed oute, With hir wommen ridyng hir aboute. Þe whiche anoon whan Grekis dide espie, In-to þe felde gan hem faste hi?e: And first of alle worþi Meneste, Pantasillia whanne he dide se, With his sporis made his stede gon; And with a spere rood to hir anoon, Of whom þe quene astonyd neuer-adel, Cau?t eke a spere þat was squarid wel, Ro[u]nde þe shafte, and þe hed wel grounde, Whiche as þei coupe smet him doun to grounde, And maugre hym reved him his stede. But þanne in haste in cam Diomede, And cruelly to þe quene gan ride; And she as faste on þe toþer side Rood eke to hym, in platis bri?t &amp; shene; And as þei mette with her speris kene, She hitte so þis felle Diomede, For al his my?t and his manlyhede, Þat she hym made his sadel for to lese —Þer is no more, he my?t[e] þo nat chese. And in dispite of his men echon, She hath his sheld hym beraft anoon, And it delyuereth, proudly as she rood, To a maide þat vppon hir abood. How Pantasilia toke Thelamon prisoner. And like a tigre in his gredinesse, Or like, in soth, to a lyounesse, Þat day she ferde, ridynge vp &amp; doun Amonge þe Grekis, til þat Thelamoun Gan beholde þe slau?ter [þat] she made, —Of hi?e dispit and rancour ouerlade, As he þat my?t for Ire not sustene, Gan ren his hors to falle vppon þis quene. But whan þat she his comynge dide espie, She fil on hym in hir malencolye So mortally, maugre his kny?tes alle, Þat to þe grounde she made him for to falle, And Grekis put in so grete dis[a]ray, Wher-euere she rood al þat ilke day; For þei my?t a-forn hir nat sustene. And þoru? þe helpe of kyng Philymene, As myn auctor recordeth in his boke, Amyd þe feld Thelamoun she toke, And sent hym forþe þoru? her hi?e renoun As prisoner toward Troye toun. Til vn-to rescus cam cruel Diomede, And cruelly on hem þat gan him lede He fil vnwarly, with an huge route Of his kny?tes ridynge hym aboute, And from her hondis, maugre al her my?t, He hym deliuereth like a manly kny?t. At whiche tyme, þis hardy quene anon, With hir wommen aboute hir euerychon, Þe Grekis hath a-forn hir on þe pleyn (As writ Guydo) so mortally be-leyn, Þat she hem made of necessite Oute of þe feld with her swerd to fle, Þat verrayly it was incredible, And to leve a maner impossible, To sene þe wommen Grekis so enchase, Whiche my?t[e] nat abide a-forn her face, Nor in þe feld in any wyse stonde: For þei hem dryve to þe silfe stronde, Doun to þe clyf of þe salt[e] se, And slowe of hem so huge gret plente, Þat finally þei had[de] be distroyed For euere-more, and outterly accloied, Nadde Diomede stonde[n] at diffence, And of kny?thod maked resistence: For he þat day, in parti and in al, For Grekis stood as a sturdy wal, And was allone her helpe &amp; chef socour. But for al þat, with worship &amp; honour, Pantasillya, as made is memorie, Repeired is wiþ conquest and victorie, With alle hir wommen in-to Troye toun Vp-on þe hour of Phebus goynge doun. And by þe side of þis hardy quene, Armyd in stel, rood kyng Phylymene, Whom Priamus hath with gret reuerence Kny?tly reseved, &amp; dide his dilligence Hem to refreshe with euery maner þing Þat my?t[e] be vn-to her likyng, As her hertis koude best deuyse. And after þis, in ful goodly wyse, He þanked hath þe noble hardy quene, Of hir goodnes þat hir lyste to sene To helpyn hym in his grete nede, And offrid hir (in Guydo as I rede) Al þat he hath, tresour and richesse, Hopynge fully þoru? hir worþines Vp-on Grekis avengid for to be, And for to kepe hym and his cite Maugre Grekis, whiche of hem seye nay. For, as I rede, after day be day She stint[e] nat proudly hem tassaile, Ageyn whos swerd þei my?t[e] nat availe, So mortally she made her sides blede. How Pirrus, the son of Achilles, was Receyuyd of Kyng myrundones. Til Menelay fro kyng Lycomede Repeired is wiþ Neptolonyus, Whiche is in bokes called eke Pirrus, Whilom þe sone of cruel Achilles, Whom for to sen ful huge was þe pres Of þe Grekis goynge enviroun. And for he was by successioun Born to ben eyer of þis Achilles, He was resseyued of Mirundones With grete honour &amp; gret solempnite, So glad were þei her ?ong[e] lord to se, To whom echon þei maden affiaunce, And wern eke sworn by bonde &amp; assurance For lyf or deth to hym to be trewe, As his liges, and chaunge for no newe— To obeie his lust in al maner þing. And after þis, Agamenoun þe kyng Made hym kny?t; and Thelamonivs With a swerde girte a-noon Pirrus, Seiynge to hym in þe silve place, With þe baudrik whan he him dide enbrace: “Take hede,” quod he, “myn owne cosyn dere, To resemble in manhod &amp; in chere, In kny?thod eke, and in worþinesse To þi fader, whiche in sothfastnesse In his tyme was so noble a kny?t; And ouermore, with al þi ful[le] my?t Tavenge his deth þat þou do þi peyne.” And þanne of Grekis worþi dukes tweyne Ful humblely gonne doun to knele, And sette a spore vp-on ouþer hele, As was þe maner, of gold bornid bri?t. And in þis wyse Pirrus was made kny?t, As ?e han herde, in ful hi?e presence, With gret honour and due reuerence, Like þe custom of þe Grekis lawes And þe rytis vsede in þo dawes. And þanne anoon hath Agamenoun, With ful glad chere and gret affeccioun, Delyuered hym fully by sentence Þe armys hool, with-outen difference, Whiche Achilles be his lyve bar— His worþi fader—on his sholdris squar, As for next eyr of lyn[e] by discent; And al þe tresour also &amp; his tent, Armvre &amp; al, deliuered wern anoon Vn-to Pirrus; and Grekis euerychon Ey?te dayes, swyng by and by, Þoru?-oute þe oste, ful solempnely Þei halwe in honour of þis ?ong[e] kny?t. How Pantasillia the quene and her wemen and the Troyens obtaynede a great felde agaynst the Grekys, and putt them to flyght: wich felde endured the space of iiij wekes &amp; more. Til on [a] morwe [whan] Phebus shoon ful bri?t, Whiche with his li?t þat shyneþ fro so ferre Diffacid haþ þe stremys of þe sterre Lucifer, þe daies Messanger, Whan Grekis gan in platis bri?t &amp; cler Enarmen hem þat day, for sour or swete, Fully in purpos with her foon to mete; And manfully oute of her tentis wyde Ageyn Troyens þei be-gan to ryde, Warde after warde, proudly in-to feld. And Pirrus bar þat day vp-on his shelde His fadris armys, like as seit[h] Guydo; And of þe same he hadde vp-on also A cote armvre þat by-cam hym wel; And forþe he rood, armed bri?t in stel, And casuelly, formest as he was, He mette first with Pollydamas, A kny?t of Troye, a ful manly man: And furiously Pirrus to hym ran On horse-bak, with a my?ti swerde, And gan to hurtle with him in þe berde So my?tely, in þis hatful strif, Pollydamas had[de] loste his lyf Nad reskus be, with-oute more tariynge, Of Phylymene, þe noble worþi kyng, Only of kny?thod &amp; of worþines. To whom Pirrus faste gan him dresse With his swerd, &amp; smet hym in þe siy?t, Þat from his horse he made him to a-li?t; For he þe strok my?t[e] nat sustene. And sothfastly þis worþi Philymene Of Pirrus had y-take be anoon, Save his kny?tes, assemblid in-to on, Of Pafagonye, cam hym to reskwe: But Pirrus ay so fersly gan purswe Vp-on þis kyng with Mirundones, Beset in meschef amonge þe grete pres, Þat many kny?t of þis noble kyng I-slay[e]n was at his reskwyng— He stood of deth in so streit a caas. Til of fortune cam Pollydamas To his reskus, and dide his ful[le] my?t Hym to deliuere, &amp; quyt hym lyke a kny?t; But, in sothnes, þere was swiche resistence Of Pirrus kny?tes, stondynge at diffence, Þat ay in meschef stood kyng Philymene, Til Pantasillya, of Femenye [þe] quene, Wiþ hir wommen a gret companye, Gan þis þinge of auenture espie,— Whiche wern echon, for þe more delyt, On her armvre þat day clad in whyt, Þat verrayly þer was no lylye flour Nor snowe þat flakeþ fro Iubiteris tour Of whitnes fressher on to sene, Þanne in þe feld was þis hardy quene, Whiche first of alle amonge [þe] Grekes ches Proudly to falle on Mirundones. Amonges whom ridyng vp &amp; doun, She hem vnhorseth þoru? her hi?e renoun, And slowe of hem vp-on euery syde, Makynge her rengis for to seuere wyde, Til Thelamoun in a furious hete With a spere vnwarly dide hir mete, And in a rage smot hir to þe pleyn. But she anoon ful lyfly roos ageyn, And with hir swerd so marked Thelamoun, Þat from his hors she made hym ly?t[e] doun, Plat to þe grounde on his hondis tweyne. And þanne hir wommen dide her besy peyne To make her quene hir stede to recure. And al þis while stood in auenture Of his lyf worþi Philymene, Pirrus kny?tes wern on hym so kene, Maugre his men þat þei han hym take —It geyneth nat diffense for to make, Þe Grekis han so strongly hym be-set;— And forþe þei lad him, it my?t[e] be no bet, Toward her tentis, þoru?-oute al þe feld. Þe whiche þing whan þe quene behyld, With hir wommen þat a-boute hir rood Pursued after, with-oute more abood, Þat finally þei han so after swed, Þoru? her force þat he was reskwed, Maugre þe manhood of Mirundones. And Pantasillia was so mercyles Vp-on Grekis, þat of necessite, Þoru? hir force and hir cruelte, Aforn hir swerd þei durst[e] nat abide. But whan Pirrus sawe hir gret[e] pride, To his kny?tes lowde he gan to crye, And seide it was shame &amp; villenye, For þe wommen so to lese her lond And to be sleyn so felly of her hond: “Wherfore echon ?oure hertis doth resvme, And of assent late vs now conswme Þe pride of hem, þat noon awey eskape; For, but ?if we som remedie shape Þis ilke day her force to confounde, Shamful report to vs shal rebounde Perpetuelly, wher we slepe or wake!” And as Pirrus gan his swerde to take, Furiously and with a kny?tly chere, Þis hardy quene happed for to here Al þat Pirrus to his kny?tes spak— Hir liste nat onys for to tourne bake, Nor of his thret for to taken hede; For platly she hade of hym no drede, But ri?t proudly gan to nei?en nere, And to hym seide anoon, as ?e shal here: “O þou Pirre, sone of Achilles, Þat slowe Hector, in kny?thod per[e]les, Þoru? his treynes &amp; his trecherie, By malys only and by fals envie, Vnwar, whan he no þinge dide aduerte! Þe whiche neuere may oute of myn herte, So grene it stikeþ in my remembraunce, Vp-on his deth for to do vengaunce! And it sit wel, as semeth vn-to me, Þat his deth be venged vppon the First of al, and on þi fadres blod, For loue of hym, so gentil &amp; so good— Þe deth of whom shuld al þe worlde compleyne. Nat only men done her besy peyne To quyte his deth, but wommen eke also With al her my?t helpen eke þer-to, As ri?t requereth, with-oute excepcioun, Þer-on to done ful execucioun; “And I now stonde in þe same plite. And for þou hast vs wommen in dispit, Of oure power, shortly in sentence, Þow shalt in haste haue experience And knowe oure force, sothly, euerydel, Ri?t in short tyme, truste me ri?t wel, Here in þis feld, in shedynge of þi blood!” Wher-of Pirrus wexen gan as wood As any tigre, boor, or wood lyoun— So frat þe colre in his complexioun. And in his Ire fel and dispitous, He hent a spere, pale and furious, And ran at hir with al his my?t &amp; peyne; And a-geynward, as she þat list nat feyne, Encontrid hym al deuoide of fere. But Pirrus firste brak on hir his spere, Al-be þat he my?t hir nat remeve In hir sadel, nor but litel greue. But she ageyn so sore gan him hitte, On his stede þat he may nat sitte, But descendeth endelonge þe pleyn; And vp he ros with ful gret disdeyn, And hent a swerd in his hond anoon, And made his stede lyne ri?t to goon Vp-on þis quene of passyng worþines, And inwardly of hate &amp; of wodnes In herte y-fret, smet at hir many stroke. But euere she sat stille as any oke; And of force in hir Ire pale, Efte ageyn she made hym to avale To þe erþe, maugre al his peyne. And þus þe fi?t lasteþ of hem tweyne A large whyle, til Mirundones Han take her lord by force oute of þe pres, And maked hym his hors recure ageyn. And in þis tyme on þe silve pleyn With his baner is descendid doun Þe worþi kyng, grete Agamenoun, With kynges, dukes, endelonge þe grene, With her wardis, þat wonder was to sene, So prudently in þe feld batailled, Þat han Troyens mortally assailled. But þo in hast þe kyng Phylymene, As ?e han herde, reskwed by þe quene, Whan he hath þankyd to hir worþines, With his kny?tes in he gan him dresse, And Pantasillya, assembled boþe in oon, Vp-on Grekis gonne for to goon, Where men may se, with speris sharpe grounde Eueryche oþer beren vn-to þe grounde. Þer men may sen, proudly, with-oute lak, Þe manly kny?tes ren on horse-bake; And þe wommen mortally oppresse Þe felle Grekis þoru? her hardyines, Only þoru? force of þe my?ty quene, Þat ded þei lay, curynge al þe grene. Wher-with cam in daun? Pollydamas, Fro deth reskued, &amp; with hym Eneas, Kyng Esdras eke, of Troye þe cite. And þo þe wardis gan to-gidre fle On ouþer party, fel and furious; But moste of alle Neptolonivs, Þat Pirrus hi?te, þe Grekis champioun, Irous &amp; wood on hem of Troye toun, Made his swerde in her fleshe to byte. And Pantasillya, proudly hir to quyte, Ne spareth nat with mortal woundis wyde Grekis to sleen vp-on euery side— Now here, now þer, to her confusioun. And Pirrus þanne is fallen on Glaucoun, Þe halfe broþer to Pollydamas, —For Anthenor eke his fader was— And Pirrus so, in a cruel Ire, With malencolye newe sette a-fyre, Smot Glaucoun so, or þat he toke hede, Amonge þe pres þat he fil doun ded. And Pantasillya from hir wommen alle Þe same tyme is on Pirrus falle; And he, of hir whan he hadde a si?t, Rood vn-to hir lyke a manly kny?t: And as þei hurtle on hors[e]-bak I-fere, Of auenture with swerdis stif &amp; clere, Eueryche made oþer to a-ly?t; And hatfully on fote so þei fi?t Longe or ouþer my?t of oþer wynne, Til þei were made of force for to twynne By þe wardys þat went hem a-twene— I mene Pirrus &amp; þis hardy quene. And al þis tyme daun?

Þe deth of whom, pleynly, ?if she may, Shal wel be quyt, ?if so þat Fortune Be fauourable frendly to contune Þat hir face chaunge nat contrarie. But she þat can euery day so varie, Allas þe while! &amp; selde in oon soiourne, Gan fro þis quene hir loke aweie to turne, To enhaste þoru? hir vngoodlyhede Antropos to breke hir lyves threde, As þe story pleynly shal ?ou lere, Benygnely ?if ?e list to here. [How Penthesilea, the Queen of the Amazons, was cruelly slain by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles; and how the Greeks slew ten thousand of the Trojans, and pursued them to the gates of their city.] The fatal hour, harde for to remewe, Of cruel deþ, which no man may eschewe Nor in þis lyfe finally eskape, Specially whan parchas han it shape, Aproche gan—it may noon oþer bene, Allas þe while!—of þis hardy quene, Whiche on a day, furious and wroth, In-to þe feld oute of Troye goth, And gan on Grekis proudly for to sette. And alderfirst Pirrus with hir mette Of mortal hate and indignacioun; And she in haste by þe rengis doun Rood vn-to hym swiftly on hir stede, Whos sporis sharpe made his sides blede. And as þei mette, her speris in þe rest, Þei bare so evene, markyng at þe brest, Þat her shaftis, sothly þis no tale, Gan to shyuere alle on pecis smale, With-oute bowynge ouþer bak or chyne: For nouþer made oþer to enclyne— Saue þe hed, forged harde of steel, Of Pantasillya, þat was grounde wel, In Pirrus brest percid hath so depe Þat plate, in soth, nor mail[le] my?t hym kepe, But þe sharpnes of þe speris hede Was of his blod in party died rede. Þe whiche strok whan Grekis dide espie, For-astonyd loude gan to crye, And alle attonys for þe noise &amp; soun Vp-on þis quene in þe feld cam doun, In compas wyse goynge enviroun. But þoru? hir prowesse &amp; hir hi?e renoun She hir diffendeth, þat it was mervaille; But þei, allas! so sore hir gan assaille, Þat al to-hewe þei han hir basenet, Amyd Grekis so þikke she was beset— Þat with axes and her swerdis square Hir hed in soth maked was al bare, And hir shuldris were nakid eke, allas!— Þe maille hewe of and þe rerebras. And Pirrus þan, lyke as it is founde, For anguyshe only of his grene wounde, In doute pleynly wher he shulde eskape, Toward þis quene faste gan hym rape To be avengid, what-so-euere falle, Amyd þe feld amonge [þe] Grekis alle. And whan she sawe þat he cam so faste, Of force only to mete him ?it she cast, And with hir swerd first gan hym assaille; But of hir strok it happed hir to faille, Amonge þe pres so narwe she was beset. And Pirrus swerd was so sharp[e] whet, Þat sodeinly of hir arme he smette— Allas! þer was non armour hym to lette, But raceth þoru? al þe shulder bon, So þat þis quene fil doun ded anon. And of malys for to venge hym more, At his hert þe Ire frat so sore, Þat with a chere of verray angir pale He hath hir hewe al on pecis smale, Þe whiche was to foule a cruel dede! But euere in on Pirrus so gan blede, Ni?e to þe deth, of his mortal wounde, For lak of blod þat he fil to grounde— In a trawnce ful longe gruf he lay, Til his kny?tes, in al þe haste þei may, Han take hym vp &amp; leide him on a sheld; And doolfully home oute of þe feld Þei han hym born, wounded as he was. And þe wommen of þe quene, allas! For verray sorwe &amp; inward dedly wo, Whan þei sawe her lady was a-go, For to be ded þei were so desirous, Þat in al haste, wood and furious, In a rage, with-oute gouernaile, Grekis þei gan of newe for to assaille —Tavenge her quene þei wer so hertly kynde— Þat þei slowe, sothly, as I fynde, Two þousand Grekes—on hem þei wer so wod. But, o allas! in gret disioint þei stood, Only for lak þei haue no gouernour; For she was goon þat was her chef socour, Whiche was also, to speke of hardynes, Of wommen alle lady and maistresse, As of hir hond—þat I can of rede. O ?e Troyens! ?e stonden in gret drede, Amyd þe feld al oute of gouernaunce! Þe day is come of ?oure vnhappi chaunce: For now haue ?e leder noon nor gyde— Far wel ?oure trust now on euery side! And Grekes ben vp-on ?ou so stronge Þat ?e þe feld may nat kepe longe; For þei cast hem fully ?ou to quyte Þis same day, as Dares list endite: For, as he writ, homward as þei drawe, Ten þousand Troiens wern of Grekis slawe. For alle her wardis cam attonys doun, And mortally, with-oute excepcioun, Þei kille and sle al þat hem withstood; And moste þei wern on þe wommen wood To be avenged, pleinly, as I rede, On euery halfe, &amp; her blood to shede With-oute mercy or remyssioun, Chasyng Troiens home in-to þe toun Oute of þe felde; for þer was noon abod,— So pitously þo with hem it stood Þat þei ne can noon oþer recure caste, But kepe her toun &amp; shet her gatis faste, For al her hope clene was agoon Any more to fi?te wiþ her foon.

[The sorrow of the Trojans for the death of Penthesilea; and how the Greeks cast her dead corse in a lake.] And, in þis while, with-Inne Troie toun, More þan I can make descripcioun, For þe quene þer was so gret a sorwe Of euery whi?t, boþe at eve &amp; morwe, Þat she, allas! was slay[e]n for her mede, Whiche cam so fer to helpe hem in her nede; And aldermost for þei ne my?t[e] haue Þe dede cors, to burie [it] and to graue With reuerence and wiþ honour dwe, For whiche þei gan to þe Grekis swe With gret praier and gret[e] besynes. But al in veyn and in ydelnesse Was her requeste—þe Grekis wer so wroþe. And finally, with many sondry oþe, Only of malys and of hoot envie, Þe dede cors to hem þei denye, And shortly seide, of mortal enmyte, Þat of houndis it shal deuoured be— Þer was no geyn—her rancour to compesse. But Pirrus þanne of verray gentilnesse Nolde assent to so foule a dede; But, wood and wroþe, cruel Diomede Seide openly, how it was fittynge Þat she faile of hir buriynge, Þat slay[e]n hadde so many worþi man. And þus þe strif amonge þe Grekis gan, With grete rumour and altercacioun, Til at þe laste vnder Troye toun Of hir þei han þe dede cors y-take, And cruelly in a profounde lake Þei han it cast, where I lete hir lye, And vn-to Troie ageyn I wil me hye To telle forþe howe þei lyve in pyne. [How the translator complaineth of Mars for his cruelty to the Trojans; and of the treason of Anchises, Æneas, and Anthenor.] O cruel Mars, þat hast made for to fyne Þoru? þin Ire al þe worþi blood Of Troie, allas! why hastow ben so wood Ageyn[e]s hem, to slen her kny?tes alle? Why hastow lete þi bitter venym falle On hem, allas, þou sterre infortunat!— With al þe world to make hem at debat, O hatful sterre, hoot, combust, and drye, Fyry, Irous, grounde of al envie, Hasty euere, ful of discencioun, And col[e]rik of þi complexioun! In mordre and deth ay is þi delit, In takyng vengaunce most þin appetit, First meuer of anger and of hate, Rote of contek, causynge to debate! In strif and murmur most is þi desyre, Ferful of loke as any wylde fyre, And gastful euere of þi wode si?t!

For what is worse, ouþer fer or nere, Þan a foo þat is famylyer?— For who may more harmen, ?if hym liste, Þan an enmye vp-on whom men triste? Þat to discryve, shortly in a clause, Þe verray rote and þe trewe cause Of al meschef and confusioun In euery lond is dissencioun, And more perlous ?if it be preve. Recorde I take on Troye þe cyte, Þat fond Fortune frendly ay at nede, Til longe hid hate gan a-brood to sprede. For prudence, sothly, hath prouyded Þat a regne in hit silfe deuided Shal recurles tourne wilde and wast, And þe dwellers desolat in hast: For Mars þat is of envie lord Amonge hem silfe sowen hath discord, Ageyn þe whiche may no socour be— For wers þan werre, sothly, semeth me Tresoun cured vnder a feyned pes. And rote of al was olde Anchyses, With his sone called Eneas, Daun?

And ?if so wer þat it may nat be As þei caste, by no maner woye, Þei wold[e] raþer traitours be to Troye, Priuely, so it wer nat espied, And couertly with Grekis ben allyed, Þan stonden hool with þe toun of trouþe, And wilfully, of necligence &amp; slouþe, Suraunce &amp; oþe of old made to þe toun Refuse pleinly, in conclusioun, And allyaunce lete slake and slyde, And her lygaunce sette also a-syde, In her avys þei þou?t[e] for þe beste. For þei hem caste [for] to lyve at reste, And meryer eke, for ernest or for game, To saue her lyf &amp; wander forþe in shame Þan wilfully dyen at meschef. To traisshe her toun þei hild it no repref, So þei my?t eskape hem silfe a-lyve, Hem list no þinge for þe toun to stryue; Þei sou?te, in soth, for sour or for swete, A mene weie to lyven in quiete. And here-vp-on þei han her weie nome Vn-to þe kyng; &amp; whan þat þei wer come To his presence, in ful couert wyse, Vnder colour þei be-gan deuyse To telle her tale, so þat finally Her counseil was, þat Priam outterly In no maner be nat rekkeles To purswe to Grekis for a pes, —?if it so be þat he it geten may— And ?elde ageyn to kyng Menelay, With-oute strife, þe freshe quene Eleyne, And, ouermore, þat he nat disdeyne Þe harmys don by Paris gon ful ?ore In Citheroun iustly to restore. But, o allas! of fals iniquite Þis counseil roos; for vndre in secre Þe venym was, as sugre vnder galle: For wel þei wist þat þe Grekis alle Nolde acorde, in conclusioun, To haue a pes with hem of Troye toun Whiles þei wern to swiche meschef brou?t— To trete þer-of, in soth, it was for nou?t. For Priam þanne, and Eccuba þe quene, With his sones, and wiþ Polycene, Þat ?it were lefte with hym in þe toun, Mi?t haue regned by longe succession, ?if þat Grekis ful (and nat repented) Vn-to a pes hooly hadde assentid. But þat conseil ?oue was to late, Syþen Grekes of wel elder date Hadde profrid first at Thenedoun By thavys of kyng Agamenoun A fynal pes, shortly for to seyn, So he wolde restore ageyn Eleyn Wiþ amendis, requerid of resoun, Of damages wrou?t at Cytheroun, His messageris first whan þat he sent To Priamus, þat wold[e] nat assent To þe requeste iustly þat þei brou?t: For of pes þe menes þat þei sou?t Of verray pride wern to hem denyed, By wylfulnes, allas, so wer þei guyed, For lak only of wyt &amp; of prudence. But now þei han with cost &amp; gret dispence, With slau?ter of men and many grete damage, Þe sharpe shoures &amp; þe cruel rage Abiden fully of þis mortal werre; It is ful sure þat þei wil nat differre Þe tyme forþe to trete for a pes, Hem list no þing to be so rekkeles, Nor vn-avysed what hem ou?t to do. Trowe ?e þei wil so ly?tly go Home in-to Grece with-outen recompense?— Þei wold[e] seme it were a necligence. Speke nat þer-of, for it wil nat be, Specialy now Troye þe cite In meschef stant vp-on þe final fate. Þis remedie shape was to late! For Grekis þou?t [ri?t] of verray trust, Þat þei of Troye stoden at her lust, Holdynge hem silfe verrayly victours, And of her foon fully conquerours, Wiþ-oute doute or ambiguyte. For þe counseil of þis ilke Enee, Of Anthenor and þis Anchises, As ?e han herd, to trete for a pes, Ne roos in soth but of doubilnes, Only of tresoun &amp; of hi?e falsenes, As Priamus conceyueþ by her chere, Lyke in þis boke as ?e shal after here. How Kynge Priamus and his son Amphimacus helde a great councell amonges the Troyens, as concernyng the pece betwene them and the Grekes, att the concell of Anthenour, wherof he made delay. For on a day whan þat Priamus With his sone called Amphymacus A conseil helde, with oþer of þe toun, Þis þre han made a suggestioun Vn-to þe kyng touchynge þe trete; But he anon, discret and avisee, Prudently, or he wolde assent, Gan vndergrope, pleinly, what þei ment, Only of witte and discrecioun, Or he it putte in execucioun, Makynge þer-of a maner of delay. But proudly þanne, stondynge at a-bay, Þis Anthenor wiþ-oute reuerence Spak to þe kyng in open audience, And shortly seide with a sterne chere: “?if þou liste oure counseil for to here And do þer-after, platly, þou maist chese, And but þou wilt, wher þou wynne or lese, Þis is þe fyn, þou gest no more of me, Werke after hem þat of þi counseil be.” The wise and discrete answere that Kyng Priamus made vnto Anthanor. To whom þe kyng wonder soberly Answered ageyn ful benygnely: “Sir Anthenor, ?e ou?te ?ou nat to greue, For myn entent is nat to repreue ?oure wyse conseil nor ?our prudent rede, ?if it conclude to þe comoun spede Of my peple and sauacioun; But wete ri?t wel, iustly of resoun, Vnder sugre ?if þer be cured galle, In preiudice of my liges alle, Causyng hem in meschef for to fyne, I wil þer-from outterly declyne, As ri?t requereth, for oure alder ese. And, me semeth, þis shold[e] not displese To þi conceit, nor do þe noon offence: For euery man is holden of prudence Þe wers to leue and þe better take, Wysdam to swe and foly to forsake, And remedie to seke for his sore.” The Replicacion of Anthenor and Enee to the ansswere of Kyng Priamus. And with þat word, þe Troyan Anthenor Of sodeyn Ire gan to chaunge his blod, And, abreidynge, on his feet he stood, And ful felly seide vn-to þe kyng: “Now, sekerly, þis is a wonder þing, How ?our wisdam &amp; avisenesse Ar blinded so of verray wilfulnesse, Þat ?e may nat on no side se Þe grete meschef nor aduersite Þat we are In, vp-on euery side; For we may nat dyssymvle nor hide In what disioint, pleinly, þat we stonde. Be nat oure foon also here at honde, And han be-set oure walles rounde aboute?— And we for fer dar nat issen oute, Nor be so bolde to vndone a gate, Wiþ hem to fi?t þat vs dedly hate,— We be so feble, &amp; þei are so stronge. For, sothly ?it, þei han hem amonge Fifty kynges worþi of renoun, Confederat to oure destruccioun, And þer-vp-on, platly, wil abide, Whiche vowed han in her grete pride, Neuere to parte hen[ne]s fro þe toun Til þe walles be turned vp-so-doun. ?oure worþi sonys also be now dede, Þat ?ow were wont to helpen in ?our nede; ?oure manly kny?tes slay[e]n euerychon, Þat vs to saue remedie is noon! It is in veyn to treten of diffence. Wherfor, I rede, of resoun &amp; prudence, Or we be slayn and oure cite lese, Of tweyne harmys þe lasse for to chese: Þis to seyn, þat in oure entent, As fittynge is and expedient, We trete of pes and no lenger feyne, And her-wiþ-al restore ageyn Eleyne, For loue of whom many worþi man Hath lost his lif sithen þe werre gan— For now Paris is vnder stoon y-grave— Þe beste rede, in soth, þat ?e may have, To sende hir home ageyn to Menelay, And to profre, as ferforthe as ?e may, To restore with-Inne a litel while Þe harmys done by Parys in þe Ile Whiche men are wont Cithera to calle. Þis is my rede here a-fore ?ou alle.” And with þat word vp roos Amphymacus, To þis counseil ful contrarius, And shortly seide [þat] it shal nat be As Anthenor haþ raad, in no degre; And evene þus, with-oute more respit, He spak to hym of verray hi?e dispit: “Þou Anthenor, I haue espied wel, We may truste in þe neueradel Wiþ vs to stonde in oure gret[e] nede: For trouþe &amp; faiþe in þe be now dede, Falshed hath slayn in þe stabilnes; And in stede of þi sikernes We fynde in þe, sothly, varyaunce. Wher is be-come þe feith of þi lygaunce, Þin hestis made to stonde with þi kyng? Where ben þin oþes, so double in menynge? Wher is now hid þin olde assuraunce? Where is be-come þi feyned fals constance?— In stede of whiche, mvtabilite Hath take his place, like as we may se, With new[e] chaunge. Þou art so rem[e]vable, Vp-on no grounde þou maist nat stonde stable; Þi trouþe is goon, of old affeccioun, Þat þou shuldist han to stonde with þe toun, Of feith with vs for to lyve or deye: For trust &amp; hope exiled bene a-weye In þi persone, shortly for to wryte, Þat besi arte þe kyng to excite, In disencres of his estat royal, Vn-to Grekis now to be so thral To seke a pes, as it were for drede! Þou shuldest rather of þi manlyhede Haue profrid hym þe cite to diffende, Þer-on þi life at outtraunce to dispende! Wherfore, in sothe, here I þe assure, Raþer þan we shulde þis endure, Twenty þousand shal with spere &amp; sheld Vp-on a day be slay[e]n in þe feld. Þi worde I holde for no prophesie, For it procedeth of verray trecherie, Of doubilnes &amp; of false tresoun, Vndirmynynge with prodicioun— Þou? þat þou outward shewe faire, Þe venym hid þi tale doth empaire, Liche a serpent stinginge vndir floures— Þer be to fele of swiche conseillours!” And in þis wyse with wordis dispitous Ful bytyngly hath Amphymacus Al openly Anthenor repreved, With his counseil so he was agreved, Seynge þe tresoun þat he wolde mene, Til Eneas gan to goon be-twene With florisshed speche ful of flaterie, And gan his tale so to modifie Like as he ment trouþe in his entent; But þer-in was double intendement: He spak but oon, &amp; ?it he ment[e] tweyne, Amphymacus only to refreyne, Tatempren hym of his malencolye, Only til he my?t a tyme espie, Liche his purpos þat he may procede To execute it fully vp in dede. And whan þat he founden had a space, Vnder pretens of a trewe face With his tale he gan to breken oute, Many Troyan stondynge him aboute, And shortly seide, for conclusioun, Touching diffence, pleinly, of þe toun, How þat it hinge hooly in ballaunce,— “For boþen hope, truste, and assuraunce Of þe cite taken han her fli?t; For finally oure manhod &amp; oure my?t And oure kny?thod to-gidre ben a-goo, With þe Grekis more to haue a-do. And þei ben redy vppon vs to sette; And we dar nat oure gatis more vnshet, We ben, allas! supprised so wiþ drede. Þan, semeth me, how it wer gret nede By good avys for to seke a mene In þis meschef how we shal vs demene. And, for my parte, sothfastly I seie, I know as now noon so redy weie As prudently for a pes to trete.” But Priam þanne, in a sodeyn hete, Wiþ-oute abood, of chere and face pale, Of rancour gan interrupte his tale; For he attempre my?t[e] nat his herte, So fretingly þe tresoun made hym smerte. And for he my?t him silfe nat restreyne, Þus he seide vn-to boþe tweyne, To Anthenor and also to Enee: “I wonder gretly þat ?e hardy be In ?oure trouþe, for shame! so to varie, And þat ?e ben so rebel &amp; contrarie To me, only of false collusioun Vs to bringe in disperacioun— Me and my liges, ?if I shal nat feyne, Of false entent to cacche vs in a trayne! Allas! how may ?e in ?our hert[e] fynde Ageyn Nature for to ben vnkynde, Þat whylom wern of my counseil chef Of euery þing or it was brou?t to pref; For ?e absent, I koude no þing fyne. And now, allas! ?e cast[e] to declyne Away fro me, bareyne lefte and sool, Þat to remembre it is to gret a dool,— How any wy?t, allas! so chaunge can! For who shal more trusten any man, Whan ?e be founde double of entent? Can ?e nat þinke, how by ?our assent, By ?oure conseil and by ?oure avys, Whilom how I sent[e] forþe Paris In-to Grece, of ful ?ore a-goo? And, Anthenor, þou wost þi silfe also, How þou were first made embassatour, And þer-vppon chevest conseillour Touchinge þe sonde made for Exioun; And, after þat, cause and mocioun Þou were in soth þat Paris shuld[e] go In-to Grece,—þou wost wel it is so! For I ne durst, of presumpcioun, Haue sent Paris vn-to Cytheroun Wiþ-oute avis and auctorite Of Eneas, pleinly, and of þe— Vp-on Grekis a werre to haue gonne. I trowe in soth þat ?e nouþer konne Excuse hym silfe, and ?e ben avised; For euery þing wrou?t was &amp; deuised And execut by conseil of ?ou tweyne: For whan Paris wente for Eleyne, Grounde &amp; rote, to speke in special, Were þou, Enee, and cause principal, Present also whan euery þinge was wrou?t, Oute of Grece whan she was heder brou?t. For þis þe soþe, oute of þat regioun She neuere hadde comen to þis toun ?if þou haddest be þer-to contrayre, Al-be þou woldest with þi wordes faire Þi silfe excuse here in audience, As þou knewe nou?t of þat offence, But fully were vnwytinge of þe dede. And now my sones euerychon be dede, And ?e me sen allone, destitut, ?oure conseil is, as for chef refut, Me to purswe to Grekis for a pes, As I were for?etel, rekkeles To remembre þe infinit outtrages, Þe mortal werre, slau?ter, &amp; damages, Þe cruelte and distruccioun Þat þei han wrou?t here vp-on þis toun, Þat, verraily, whan I al recorde, For to be ded, I can nat acorde With hem to trete, like as ?e deuise. For I espie in many sondri wyse In ?oure entent a ri?t perlous snare, So couertly vnder falshed dare, Þat it wil be to my confusioun ?if ?e acheve ?oure entencioun Finally as ?e haue it shape. For impossible it were to eskape Shamefully at meschef me to dye, With-oute recure of any remedie: For þis þe fyn, I knowe it oute of doute, Of þe trete þat ?e ben a-boute!” And ri?t anoon þe Troyan Eneas Of Ire &amp; rancour so [a]meved was Ageyn þe kyng, with a swollen herte, Þat sodeynly oute at þe dore he sterte, After he hadde, for to ben a-wroke, Ful many worde ageyn þe kyng y-spoke— He went his way and Anthenor also. And Priamus of verray Ire and wo Sodeinly braste oute for to wepe, —He my?t hym silf nat for anguysh kepe, Þe anger frat vp-on hym so sore— With-Inne hym silfe conceivynge more &amp; more, By evidence of discrecioun, Þe couert gyle and þe false tresoun Þat þei for hym and [for] his cite I-shapen han, but he avised be— Dredynge ay þat þese ilke tweyne Be som engyn or conspired treyne To þe Grekes wolden hym be-tray. How Kyng Priamus, with his son Amphimacus, deuysed to bryng Eneas and Anthanour to deth. Wherfore, þe kyng cast &amp; wolde saie Shape a wei her malis to with-stonde, So þe tresoun þat þei toke on honde, Only of ri?t, in dede, or it were founde, Vp-on hem silfe my?t ageyn rebounde, Þat þe fulle execusioun Of her contrived conspiracioun Resorte ageyn, in ful due wyse, Only on hem þat gan it first deuyse. Tresoun for tresoun is conuenient: For to falshede þe guerdoun pertynent Is shameful deth, and þe final mede. Wherfore, to shape in þis grete nede A remedie, þis olde Priamvs Calleth to hym his sone Amphimacus, And pitously, allone but þei tweyne, In teris drownid gan to hym compleyne On Anthenor and on þis Eneas, And seide: “sone, take hede in þis caas, And þinke how I am þi fader dere, And how þer be now no more in fere Of my sonys lefte with me a-lyve But þou allone; &amp; þerfore as blyve, Touchynge þe tresoun conspired &amp; y-sworn, What-euere falle, lat vs be to-forn Only of wysdam a weie for to make, Þat we may first in þe trappe hem take, And to purveie for hem evenelyche, Þat iustly þei may fallen in þe diche Whiche þei han made &amp; for vs y-treyned. And in al hast late so be ordeyned Þat þis mater cloos be kepte in mewe, To fyn only þat þei nat eschewe For to be slayn, of equyte and ri?t, In þis place evene toward ny?t. For I purpose, pleinly, for her sake, A-geyn þat hour a counseil for to make, And, vnder coloure, make hem boþe calle, And þou vnwarly shalt vp-on hem falle With kny?tes sworne [vn-]to þe and me, In þis mater for to ben secre.” And ri?t anoon þis Amphymacus Assentid is vn-to Priamus, To acomplishe in ful secre wyse Fro point to point, as ?e han herde deuise. But soth is seid of ful ?ore a-goon Of olde wyse, þat counseil is þer noon In al þis wor[l]d so priuely y-cast Þat it wil oute, platly, at þe last. For þe peple which þat is rual Seith þat secres, whiche be nat kouþe at al, Þe erthe wil, as þei make mynde, Discuren hem of his owne kynde, And of nature vp casten &amp; disclose Þe þing þat men ar wont in it to close. Late euery man be war, as it is good, Or his counseil go to fer a-brood; And specialy lordes han grete nede: Of alle men þei stonde most in drede, So gret a-wait is vp-on hem laide, Þat whan it happeþ [þat] a þing be seide Or onys spoke of a lordis mouþe, It falleth ofte þat it is ful kouþe, And reported &amp; y-sprad ful wyde In many cost by hem þat stonde a-side, Or he be ware, by sodeyn auenture. For somme, in hap, in whom he doth assure, Wil first of al hym report amys; Þerfore, in soth, best for hem is this: For to be war and to kepe her tonge. A purpose cast shuld[e] nat be ronge Nor spoke a-brood amonges folkes rude; For gladly ay þe werst[e] þei conclude Of euery þing, while þat it is newe, In report variaunt and vntrewe. For after resoun no þing þei expowne, But after wil, þe folke þat ben of tovne, Like þe purpos whiche þei desire; For þei faren as a wisp a-fire: Whanne it brenneþ bri?test in his blase, Sodeinly it wasteþ as a mase. On swiche folke, platly, is no trist, Þat fire &amp; water holden in her fist, Beinge with boþe y-liche indifferent, Now hoot, now colde;—liche as þere entent Of newe changeþ, so, in her corage, After þe calm folweth sodeyn rage: To-day þei loue [&amp;] to-morwe hate, To trust a comovn lasteþ by no date— Late nat a lord make hem to secre! For now þe conseil is ronne to Enee, Þat Priam wend had[de] ben ful cloos: For þe rumour &amp; þe wynde a-roos By false report, and so fer is blowe, Þat Eneas &amp; Anthenor well knowe Ende &amp; gynnynge, &amp; euery maner þing, And hool þe conseil of Priamus þe kyng. And boþe two, ful of oon entent, Wiþ oþer [eke] þat wern of her assent Conspired ben and to-gidre sworne, And couertly caste a weie a-forne, Þat finally Troye þe cite By her engyn shal distroied be, And of accorde caste pleinly þus: ?if it hap þat kyng Priamus Sende for hem, shortly to conclude, Þei wolde com with swiche a multitude Of armed men, ?if þei seie nede, Þat of hym þei shulde no þing drede. For Eneas was in þat cite Of gret power and auctorite, Boþe of blood &amp; of kynrede allied, And for his gold gretly magnyfied Þoru? þe cite most in special, Þat he in my?t &amp; power perigal (As seith Guydo) was vn-to þe kyng. And Anthenor almoste in euery þing Was vn-to hym egal of power. And boþe tweyne of oon herte entere Conspired han in soth ageyn þe toun, Finally to þis conclusioun, Þat þei of Grekis my?t haue surete, With her tresour to goon at liberte, With her allies borne of Troye toun, Whanne al wer brou?t to distruccioun— With lif &amp; good, sauf, with-oute mor. How Eneas &amp; A[n]thanour Vnderstode how the Kyng had conspired their deth, came to þe kyng with a grete multitude, &amp; seide At whiche tyme for daun? Anthenor And Eneas Priamus hath sent, To a-complishe þe fyn of hys entent. And þei in haste with so gret a route Cam of kny?tes stuffed hem aboute, Þat þer-of was astonyd Priamus, And made sende for Amphymacus, Commaundinge him to chaunge his purpos; For wel he wist his counseil was nat clos, And be signes gan wel vndirstonde Þat þe mater whiche þei had on honde Discured was, to his confusioun: Boþe þe mordre and conspiracioun, A-parceivynge in his inward si?t Þe grete power of þis Troian kny?t, And þe fauour of þis Eneas, And of þe comoun how he fostred was. Þe whiche prowdly in open audience To-fore þe kyng declareth his sentence, Fully concludinge, maugre who seith nay, How þat þer was noon oþer mene way, Refut nor geyn, nor oþer remedie But only pes, who-so it denye— Oþer eskapynge, pleinly, was þer noon. And þer-vppon þe comouns euerychon With o vois gan to gale and crye, And his conseil gretly magnefie, Al-be þe kyng was þer-to contrarie. But Eneas list no lenger tarie Nor differre þe fyn of his purpos, But wonder Irous from his se he ros, And ful vngoodly spak vn-to þe kyng, And shortly seide, with-oute more tariyng: “Wher-so be-falle þou be lefe or lothe, Or wiþ þis purpos plesid ouþer wroþe, Þou maiste wel truste it shal noon oþer be: For finally, herkene þis of me! Maugre þi wille &amp; also [al] þi my?t, Þis same day, ?it or it be ny?t, For a pes wiþ Grekis we shal trete!” And whanne þe kyng sawe þe feruent hete Boþe of þe comoun and of Eneas, He gan anoon dissymulen in þis cas; For of prudence he clerly gan to se, For þat tyme it may non oþer be. Wherfore, sith he my?t it not a-mende, He wysly gan for to condecende To þe purpos, platly, of Enee, And seide he wolde goodly take at gre And accepte what hym list ordeyne. And so þe kyng lerned for to feyne Ageyn þe conceit, platly, of his herte; For oþer wyse he koude nat asterte, Coact of force and of violence. And whan he sawe in his aduertence Þat he my?t diuerten on no side From þe fraude, þat sowe was so wide, With-oute grucching he fully ?af assent, Þat Anthenor shulde forþe be sent By comoun choys to trete for þe toun— Whiche was to-forn, in conclusioun, With [þe] Grekis acorded finally, Touchinge theffect of his embassatry, Fro point to point, wher he wolde stonde Variaunt fro þat he toke on honde. And for þei had a-forn hym ful conceived, With better chere he was of hem received. And in þis while þat Anthenor was oute For to trete with þe Grekis stoute, As ?e han herde, for a pes final, In þe toun aboute on euery wal Þei of Troie gan ascende blyve With þe braunchis of many freshe olive, In tokne of pes; &amp; Grekes eke ageyn Amyd þe feld, endelonge þe pleyn, Shewed hem, þat alle my?t[e] sene, Eke of olyue lusti bowes grene. And to conferme þis fro point to point, And þat no þing stood in no disioint, Þe worþi kyng, grete Agamenoun, Committed hath of hi?e discrecioun Fully power and auctorite For þe Grekis, pleinly, vn-to þre, First of al for a pes to trete: Vn-to þe wyse worþi kyng of Crete, To Vlixes and to Diomede— To chese mo hem þou?t it was no nede; For what þei do þei wil holde stable, And finally nat be variable From þe ende, platly, þat þei make. And here-vppon was assurance take Of ouþer part by bonde of sacrament. And so þei be with Anthenor y-went Oute a-side, þese worþi lordes þre. And whanne þei wern at her liberte, From al tvmulte allone prively, Þis Anthenor, ful of trecchery, Replet of falsehod &amp; of doubilnesse, Gan his purpos vn-to hem expresse, Byhotynge hem to traisshe þe cite, So þei wolde make hym surete, Þat first hym silfe &amp; with hym Eneas Shal fredam han in euery maner caas, Wiþ her allies and goodis euerychon, Wher þat hem list at large for to goon, At her chois, or dwellen in þe toun, With her richesse and posessioun, With-outen harme or any more damage, Liche as þei se it be to avauntage Of her personys, to voiden or abide. And þei wer sworn on þe Grekis side Couenaunt to holde in parti and in al, As was rehersid a-forn in special, And as þei werne by her oþes bounde, So þat þer be no variaunce founde On ouþer parti, platly, nor no strif, And þei be-hi?te vp pereil of her lyf. And whan he had assuraunce of hem þre, He charged hem to kepen in secre Al þat was seid, þat no þing be discured Vn-to tyme þat þei were assured Of þe ende, grocid vp in dede: For it were good þat þei toke hede List her purpos perturbed were or shent By commvnynge, wiþ-oute avisement, Of þis tongis, þat be so longe &amp; large. Wherfore he gan coniuren hem &amp; charge, In al[le] wyse for to bene preue, So þat no wy?t but he and þei þre, Of noon estat, nowþer hi?e nor lowe, Fully þe fyn of her entent ne knowe. “And couertly oure purpos for to hide,” Quod Anthenor, “vp-on euery side To voide a-weie al suspecioun, Þis myn avys: þat to Troye toun Þe wyse kyng called Taltibyvs Shal go with me to kyng Priamus, For he is hoor and y-ronne in age, Coy of his port, slei?ti &amp; ri?t sage, And þer-with-al sadde, demwr, &amp; stille. Of whom Troyens no þing shal mysille, But þat he come to tretyn for a pes, To ben assured and witen dout[e]les Wher þe Troiens agreen wil þer-to, In euery þing finally to do As Anthenor þe Grekis hath be-hi?t. Þus shal þei ben devoided anoon ri?t Þoru? his comynge from al suspecioun, Til þat we han oure conclusioun, As ?e han herde, parformed euerydel.” Of whiche þing þe Grekis like wel, And ben apointed vp-on euery þing What þei wil do, &amp; how þis olde kyng Wiþ Anthenor shal to Troye goo. And after þis, he axede eke also Of Pantasile þe body for to haue, In þe cite þat men my?t it graue With due honour longynge to hir estat, To voide aweie suspecioun and debat. And Anthenor (for it drowe to eve) Of þe Grekis taken hath his leue, And with þis kyng repeireþ in-to toun. Where-of was made anoon relacioun To kyng Priam, with-oute more delay. And he in hast vp-on þe nexte day Made assemble alle his Cite?eyns, Secrely deuoidyng alle foreyns, Where Anthenor in open audience, Þoru? þe halle whan maked was silence, His tale gan with sugred wordis swete, Makyng þe bawme outward for to flete Of rethorik and of elloquence, Of cher nor word þat þer was noon offence, In shewynge oute so circumspect he was, Þat no man koude, in no maner cas, Be signe outward nor by countenaunce Parceive in hym any variance —So harde it was his tresoun to espie— Theffect declaringe of his embassatrie, With cler report of his answer ageyn, In his menyng þou? he wer nat pleyn: For vnder-neþe he was with fraude frau?t, Þis slei?ti wolfe, til he his pray haþ kau?t: For he was clos and couert in his speche As a serpent, til he may do wreche, Hydinge his venym vnder floures longe; And as a be, þat stingeþ wiþ þe tonge Whan he haþ shad oute his hony sote, —Sugre in þe crop, venym in þe rote— Ri?t so, in soth, with tonge of scorpioun Þis Anthenor, rote of al tresoun, His tale tolde wiþ a face pleyn, Liche þe sonne þat shyneþ in þe reyn, Þat fair[e] sheweþ þou? þe weder be Wonder diuers &amp; troubly for to se. So þis tigre, ful of doubilnesse, So couertly his tresoun dide expresse, As he nat ment but trouþe to þe toun, Fully affermyng, in conclusioun, How þe Grekis my?ti were and stronge, And likly eke to abide longe, Day be day redy hem tassaille, And hadde also plente of vitaille— Concludynge ay þer was no remedie Ageyn[e]s hem to holde champartie Nor with hem any more to stryue. For (he seide) þei had ?et a-lyve Her worþi kny?tes, hardy as lyouns, Her manly men and her champiouns, Whiche, here lyves, platly, to iuparte, From þe cite caste hem nat departe Til her purpos acheued be in al: “For finally nouþer tour nor wal, Nor ?oure gatis of Iren þou? ?e shette, Þe Grekis shal on no side lette, But þat þei wiln vs wynne at þe laste! Wherfor, it nedeth a mene weie to caste, Siþen of my?t nor fauour of fortune We may nat longe ageyn[es] hem contwne. Wherfore,” qoud he, “so ?e condescende, I can ri?t wel al þis þing amende, Remedien, so þat ?e nat varie To þat I seie for to be contrarie— Þis to mene, shortly out of doute, Embassatour whan [þat] I was oute Wiþ þe Grekis last whan ?e me sent, Þei seide goodly, how þei wold assent Vn-to a pes by þis condicioun: Þat ?e wil make restitucioun Of þe harmys and þe violencis, Þe wrongis done, and also þe offencis By Paris wrou?t in Grece at Citheroun, As it is ri?t, me semeth, of resoun. For her request is meint with equite, And we be driven of necessite Vn-to her lust iustly to enclyne, Maugre oure wil þe werre for to fyn; For al is now in her elleccioun, We may nat make no rebellioun, Now þe mater is so fer y-brou?t, To strive a-?eyn, in soth, it helpith nou?t, It may apeire but no þing availle! Therfore þe beste þat I can consaille, As in prouerbe it hath be seied of ?ore, Þat ?if a man be constreyned sore, And may nat fle, to fallen in a treyne, Lete hym chese þe lasse harme of tweyne, And þe gretter prudently eschewe. And lete oure gold, þat is kepte in mewe, To saue oure lif make redempcioun: For better it is, demeth of resoun, Spoiled to ben only of richesse, Þan wilfully deyen in distresse: Þe lyf is bet þan gold or any good— Set all at nou?t in saving of ?our blood! For foly is a man for his welfare Þoru? couetyse any gold to spare! And now oure lyf dependeþ in balaunce, Late gold fare wel &amp; goon with meschaunce, We may here-after, by sort or auenture, Gold by grace and good ynow? recure! And sithen we, as I haue ?ow tolde, May byen [a] pes finally for golde, And with oure tresour stinten eke þe werre, It were foly, pleinly, to differre With þe Grekis outterly tacorde: For ?if so be I to hem recorde Þat ?e assent, with-outen variaunce, Þer may of pes be no parturbaunce— It is so ly?t now to be recured! For as sone as þei ben assured, By iust report, of ?oure entenciouns, Þei wil do write obligaciouns Of couenauntis, þat nat be byhynde; And þat ?e shal in hem no faute fynde, Whan assuraunce from ouþer parte is hadde, Þer-vppon endenturis shal be made, So þat of feith ?e mow hem nat repreue. And for þat þei fully trust and leue, With-oute fraude, my relacioun, I wil now make no dilacioun To signefie to hem, in certeyn, Hooly þeffect of þat ?e wil seien.” How that A[n]thanor, Enee, and Taltibus were made Imbassators to the Grekes, to trete for A pece; and of the Answer of Kynge Vlixes, Diomede, and the King of Crete, and of theire demaund. And þe peple loude gan to crye Alle with o vois, and to magnyfie Al þat euere Anthenor hath seide; And vp-on hym þei han þe charge leide Of her answere and entent final, And by record to reporten al, Þat no þing be for?eten in þis cas. Þei han assigned also Eneas Wiþ hym to goon for þe same þing, In þe presence of þe olde kyng Taltibivs, whiche also of entent With Anthenor was to Troye sent: Þe whiche þre han pleinly vndirtake, As ?e han herde, a final pes to make, Al-be þat þei in couert tresoun ment. And on her weie forþe anoon þei went, With pleyn power committed of þe toun. But kyng Priam hath ay suspecioun To Anthenor and also to Enee, How þat þei shal distroyen his cite; And to hym silfe, trist of hertly wo, He seide: “allas! what is best to do In þis meschef þat I am in falle!— And ?it is þis to me werst of alle, Þat I am now þoru? myn aduersite Bounde &amp; compelled of necessite, Maugre myn hed, in maner of ransoun For my lyf, to make redempcioun Vn-to my foon þat I haue most at herte. I se ri?t wel I may it nat asterte: For I mote paye—þer geyneth no socour— My good, my gold, richesse &amp; tresour To my most foon, and dar it nat denye! And ?it I stonde of lif in iupartie, With-oute refut hanginge in ballaunce, Allas! constreyned þoru? my woful chaunce Tobeie her lust, þat mortally me hate, Driven þer-to of birþe þoru? my fate, So parchas han my destine y-shape, By noon engyn I may it nat eskape!” And while Priam gan þus [to] compleyne, To Anthenor cam þe quene Eleyne, Beseching hym in his embassatrie Of gentilnesse for to specefie, Þoru? his prudent mediacioun, To fynd a waie in conseruacioun Of hir estat, finally þat she To Menelay may reconcyled be, —?if so falle þat þe trete holde— So þat hir lord of his grace wolde Restoren hir vn-to hir degre, Only of mercy and of hi?e pite. And Anthenor vn-to hir requeste ?af audience, makynge a beheste How he wolde, with al his herte entere, Be dilligent to trete of þis matere; And þer-with-al of hym she toke hir leve. And þis was done on þe same Eue Þat Anthenor (I pray God ?if him sorwe!) To Grekis went on þe nexte morwe, Only to trete for a pes final. And in þis while þe feste funeral Was holde in Troye, myn auctor writeþ þus, Of a lorde þat called was Glaucus, A manly kny?t to-forn in his lyvinge, And sone was to Priamus þe kyng. And ouer þis, liche as seith Guydo, Þat kyng Priam besi[e]de hym also, Of Pantasillya how þe body my?t Be conseruid freshely to þe si?t; And, for loue of þis worþi quene, Of purid golde &amp; of stonys shene He lete make a vessel ful royal, And filde it ful of bawme natural To kepe þe cors fro corrupcioun Til þe werre of Grekis &amp; þe toun Þoru? þe trete wer y-stynted clene: So þat þe kyng callid Philymene Þis dede quene my?t of affeccioun Carye it home in-to hir regioun, With hir auncetris buried for to be, Liche þe maner of old antiquite, And þe custom vsid in þat tyme— It wer in veyn mor þer-of to ryme; I passe ouere vn-to þe trete A-twene Grekis and Troye þe cite. And for þe parti of Grekis, as I rede, First Vlixes, and with hym Diomede, Assigned wern, and þe kyng of Crete, With Anthenor and Eneas to mete. And alle y-fere, shortly in sentence, By conduit first, and after by licence Of þe noble wyse Agamenoun, Þei entred ben in-to Troye toun By conveiynge of þis Eneas. Of whos commynge swiche a Ioye þer was Of þe comowns, whiche in þinges newe Reioyshen ay, after þou? þei rewe, Wenynge ful wel in her oppinioun, Þat by þe good[e] mediacioun Of Vlixes and þe kyng of Crete, And Diomede, þat cam eke to trete,— Þat þese þre shulde make as fast A final pes, euere for to last, And a ful ende of her alder sorwe. And þer-vppon, erly þe nexte morwe Priam lete make a convocacioun Of alle þe worþi with-Inne Troye toun. And whan þei were assemblid alle in oon, Þe wyse Vlixes roos hym vp anoon, And his tale gan in swiche a wyse, So prudently his wordis to deuyse, Þat to herkene euery man hath Ioye, And specially þei þat werne of Troye, Þat of his inward menynge fraudelent Ful litel wiste, nor of his entent, To her plesaunce so he koude feyne. And first he axeþ of hem þinges tweyne. Þe ton was þis: þat of þe cite He wolde haue gold an huge quantite In recompense of harmys þat wer do; A-noþer þing he axede eke also: With-oute abood þat Amphymacus, Þat sone was to kyng Priamvs, Perpetuelly þat he exiled be, Neuere to entre Troye þe cite, For gold, praier, nor for no ransoun. How A[n]thenor is confederate with the Grekes, and of his grete dissimulacion agaynst his prince, kynge Priamus. And of the suspectioun of a great noyse of Armure herd in Troy by nyght. And þis was doon by sugestioun Of Anthenor, fals and malicious, Only for he was contrarious Þat he shold[e] treten for a pes, And for þat he was nat rek[e]les To seyn a trouþe—þis Amphymacus. Þerfore, in soth, þis serpent envious, Now he hath founde a tyme for to byte, He þou?t he wold cruelly hym quyte For trouþe only þat was in his entent. Þerfore it is ful expedient, Of prudence euery man to charge, Þat his tonge be nat ouer-large: Trouþes alle be nat for to seyn; For wisdam is, som tyme for to feyne And dissymule in aduersite, Specially whan men in trouble be, And sene her speche may hem nat availle: Better is þanne þat her tonge faille, Þan folily to her damage speke. Men most amonge cure and ouerreke Þe trouþe of þinges, only of prudence, And humblely suffre in pacience For fals report of folkes envious. Who can so done, I holde hym vertuous: For bet it is a whyle to abide Þan seyn al oute of rancour &amp; of pride. Silence, in soth, hath ofte in hasty strif Hadde of victorie a prerogatyf, And þe palme of debatis wonne, Þat wel are þei þat so suffre konne, And bene of speche nat presumptuous. For, as I tolde, þis Amphymacus, Not-wiþstondynge þat he trouþe ment, ?it for a worde he [in-]to exile went, Al-be þat God ful iustly afterwarde Hath Anthenor quyt for his rewarde; For with þe same he was after hit For his falshede, duely as it sit: Þis to seyn, for his iniquite He was to exile and captiuite For-iuged after, in-to proscripcioun, And relegat oute of Troye toun Perpetuelly by þe procuringe Of Eneas. Lo! how þe ri?tful kynge, Þat al may sene in his prouidence, Ful iustly can maken recompence Of doubilnes and simulacioun, And of al swiche contrived fals tresoun: For who avengeþ with falshed for his part, He shal ben hit wiþ þe same dart; He skapeþ nat for to haue a wonde. For falshede ay wil ageyn rebounde Where it roos first, to his original Resorte ageyn, ri?t as doth a bal. For, who for fraude euere doth him caste, Truste ri?t wel, it wil out at þe laste; And who supplaunteþ shal supplaunted be, By good example, as ?e shal after se, Of Anthenor þe story ?if ?e rede. And whiles þei treten and procede Touchinge þe exile and proscripcioun, Captiuite and relygacioun Þat þei caste for Amphymacus, Þer was herde a noyse merveilous, A gret tumulte and a wounder soun, Like as it were a lamentacioun Of sondri folke pleynyng in distresse For hetly wo and inward heuynesse. Oute of þe trete evene whan þei gon, Þis confus cry after gan anoon, Where-of Vlixes and eke Diomede Sodeinly fillen in a drede, Supposynge in her oppinioun Þat som rumour was fallen in þe toun, Amonge þe peple and þe commovnte Of hasty rancour avenged for to be For þe loue of Amphymacus, Þat causeles was exiled þus Of volunte, ageyn al trouþe &amp; ri?t. Wherfor þei drad, whan it drow to ny?t To be mordrid of comouns of þe toun For þe fraude and conspiracioun Falsly compassid of old enmyte By Anthenor and by fals Enee. And, sothly ?it, þer was no maner man Þat koude wyte where-of it be-gan, Nor espie first where it aroos, In al þe paleis nor þoru?-oute þe cloos: Þei herde it wel, but þei seie nou?t. Wher-of þei werne astonyd in her þou?t, And affraied of verray sodein drede, Vlixes moste, and also Diomede, Liste wiþ commovns þei had be byset. But Anthenor, with-oute lenger let, To make hem sure, from al tvmulte &amp; cry Þe Grekes hath conveied secrely. And whan þei wern assured of her place, Vlixes first, with a chaunged face, Gan pynche sore in þe selfe while At Anthenor of tresoun and of gyle, Þat with his hestis so fro day to day, Of verray slei?te, putte hem in delay, Semynge fully, for ou[?]te he koude espie, Þer was deceit, fraude, or trecherie In þe covenauntis þat he hath be-hi?t. To whom anoon, þis fals[e] Troyan kny?t, With sadde chere &amp; sobre contenaunce, Wel avised in his dalyaunce, Answered ageyn, &amp; pleinly dide expresse: “I-wys,” quod he, “I take vn-to witnesse Þe hi?e goddes, þat euery þing may se, With-oute feynynge þat I haue besy be Fro point to point ?our purpos to acheue; But finally, so it ?ow nat greve, And paciently þat ?e list to here, Þer is o þing perturbeth þis mater, Whiche þat I shal, so it be noon offence, Pleinly remembre here in ?oure presence: Þis to seyn, of olde antiquite, First at þe bildyng of Troye þe cite, Þat whilom was y-called Yllyoun, —For cause only at his fundacioun, Kyng Ylyvs, sith[en] go ful longe, Þe founder was of þe walles stronge, After whom, as made is mencioun, It called was and named Ylyoun,— In þe whiche, with grete &amp; besy charge, In Pallas name he made a temple large, Þat passyngly was hadde in reuerence. And whan þis phane of most excellence Parformed was by masounri ful wel, And, saue þe rofe, complet euerydel, Of my?ti stoon þe bildynge wel assured— But or it was with led &amp; tymber cured, Ageyn[es] tempest for to bene obstacle, Þer fil a wounder only by myracle, Þat I dar wel afferme in certeyn, Swiche a-noþer was þere neuere seyn —Who-so list se and considren al— Þis merveil was so celestial: For þer cam doun from þe hi?e heuene, By Pliades and þe sterris seuene, And þoru? þe eyr holdyng his passage, Like a fairy a merueillous ymage, Þat in þis world þou? men had[de] sou?t, Ne was þer noon halfe so wel [y-]wrou?t. For, as it is trewly to suppose, Pigmalyon, remembrid in þe Rose, In his tyme hadde no konnyng To graue or peint so corious a þing: For it was wrou?t wiþ dilligent labour By hond of aungil in þe heuenly tour, Þoru? Goddes my?t &amp; devyn ordinaunce, And hider sent þoru? his puruyaunce, For a relik, only of his grace, And prouided to þe same place, Þer tabide for a proteccioun, For a diffence and saluacioun, Perpetuelly whil þe world may dure, Ageyn al meschef and mysauenture, Euery trouble and tribulacioun, In sustenynge and reuelacioun, And souereyn helpe eke of þis cite. Þe whiche neuer may distroyed be, By noon engyn þat men may purchase: Þe goddes han graunted swiche a grace, And swiche vertu annexed eke þer-to, Þat Troye in soth may neuer be for-do Til þis relik stole be a-way. And ?it, in soth, þer is no man þat may From þe place stere it nor remewe, But þe prest to whom it is dwe Only of offys to touche it with his hond. So my?tely conseruyd is þe bond, Þat who attempteth, in conclusioun, It to remewe of presumpcioun, At þe fyn, platly, he shal fayle: For force noon may him nat availle; For it in soth wil nat remeved be Excepte of hym to whom of duete It aparteneth, as ?e han herde to-forn. And, ouermore, þer is no man ?it born, Þat rede can, nor telle in no degre, Verraily, wher it be stoon or tre, Nor how it was deuysed nor y-wrou?t— Þer is no wy?t so sotil in his þou?t Ceriously to tellen þe manere. For Minerua, þat is so freshe &amp; clere, Þe sterne goddesse, þoru? hir gret[e] my?t, Þat is so dredful boþe of loke &amp; si?t, Whiche on hir brest haueth of cristal Hir shilde Egys—þis goddesse inmortal— I-graunted hath, in bokes as I lerne, Þoru? hir power whiche [þat] is eterne, Þis holy relik for a memorial To hir temple of bildyng most royal, It to conserue from al assaut of drede, And to socour in euery maner nede Ageyn her foon vn-to Troye toun, While it is kept with deuocioun: So þat alweye by successioun, From kyng to kyng in þe lyne doun, By iust title lyneally succede, Here-to annexed þat þei taken hede, Prudently avoidynge necligence, It to conserue with due reuerence, As þei are bounde &amp; y-holde of ri?t. Þanne shal noon enmy power haue nor my?t To do damage in hyndrynge of þe toun. And whi it is called Palladyoun, Like as clerkis write of it and seyn, Is, for Pallas, to make hir toun certeyn, Þis relyke sent fro þe heuene doun. And to conclude shortly my resoun, Þis is þe cause oure purpos is so let.” “Þan,” quod Vlixes, “sith it may be no bet, Oure labour is in ydel and in veyn, With-oute recure, ?if it be certeyn, As þou hast seyd, þis toun in no degre Þoru? þis relyk may not distroied be: It was foly þe to vndirtake Vn-to Grekis beheste for to make, With-oute þis, þou haddest be ful sure.” Quod Anthenor, “?it þer is recure: As I haue hi?t, ?e shal haue þe toun, Al-þei? þer be a dilacioun; And þe maner anoon I shal telle, ?if it so be ?e list a whyle dwelle With-oute noyse ouþe[r] perturbaunce. Þe prest, þe whiche hath þe gouernaunce Of þis relyk, shal be spoke vn-to, By good avys, and y-treted so, Þat he shal be ful of oure assent; For he with gold &amp; tresour shal be blent, Þat he accorde shal to oure purpos, To bringe þe relike, whiche is kept so clos, To what place þat ?e list assigne. Beth stille of port, goodly, &amp; benigne In ?oure werkis til I haue brou?t aboute Fully þis þing, and beth no þing in doute, I dar my silfe take it wel on honde.” And whan þei had his menyng vndirstonde, Þei toke leue &amp; wente oute of þe toun. But first to voide al suspecioun, At her goynge Anthenor hath hi?t How þat he wold goon þe same ny?t To Priamus, “to maken ordinaunce How þe bondis and þe assuraunce Of þe pes shulde y-maked be, And for to knowe eke þe quantite Of þe gold þat ?e shal receyve: Þus shal I best þe purpos aparceyve Of þe kyng to knowe it euerydel.” And þei concent, &amp; like wonder wel Euery þing þat Anthenor hath seide; And so þei parte, glad &amp; wel apaide, And wente her way &amp; made no tariyng. And Anthenor goth vn-to þe kyng, Hym counseillynge, he make no delay To calle his lordis ageyn þe next[e] day, And his liges to assemble y-fere, Finally tengrosse þis matere, As it was sittinge and expedient. And whanne þe kyng in open parlement Crowned sat in his regalie, Þis Anthenor gan to specefie In audience, þat men my?t[e] knowe, To eche estat, boþe hi?e and lowe, Þe Grekis wille, ?if þei agre þer-to, And what þe some was of gold also Whiche þei axe, ?if þe pes shal stonde: Twenti þousand marke to haue in honde Of pured gold, whiche most anon be paid, And of siluer, þat may nat be delaied, Þei most eke han þe same quantite; And ouer þis, as þei accorded be, Certeyn mesours be couenaunt also haue Of whete &amp; flour, her lyues for to saue In her repeire by þe large se, Whan þei saille home to her contre,— And þat þe collect maked be anoon, By good avis of hem euerychoon, Þat al be redy be a certeyn day. Þer was no man þat durst þo seie nay Nor contrarie þat Anthenor haþ seide, Wher-so þei wer wel or evele apaide, But ful assent, in conclusioun. And in al haste, þoru?-oute al þe toun, Þe colytours gadrid vp þe gold, Like þe somme þat I haue ?ou told,— Of pore and riche þer wer spared noon. Þe whiche tyme Anthenor is goon Vn-to þe prest þat called was Thonaunte, ?if he my?t in any wyse hym daunte: To make his herte fully to enclyne, Ful craftely he leyde oute hoke &amp; lyne, With lusty bait of fals[e] couetyse, Excitynge hym in ful secre wyse, Þat he wold[e] ben of his assent, And condescende vn-to his entent, To putten hym in pocessioun Of þe relik called Palladioun, With-oute abood it may delyuered be; And ?af hym gold an huge quantite, And hym to blende moche more him [be-]hy?t, —And þis was don ful preuely by ny?t,— Shortly concludynge, ?if he condescende, Þat he wolde his estat amende So passyngly, þat for euermore He and his heires shulde haue gold in store, Plente y-nowe, þat noon indigence Shulde haue power him to done offence. “For vn-to þe, þis a-vow I make,” Quod Anthenor, “and platly vndirtake, Of gold &amp; good þou shalt haue suffisance, And of tresour passinge habundaunce, Þat þou shalt, in verray sikernesse, Al þi kyn excellen in richesse, ?if þou delyuere, like to myn axynge, Palladioun, whiche is in þi kepynge. And I be-hote—þou maist trest[e] me— By bond of feiþ it shal be secre, List it were hindringe to þi name: For ?if so be, þat þou drede shame, To be esclaundrid of so foule a dede, I shape shal þat þe thar nat drede Nor ben agast in no maner wyse; For swiche a way, in soth, I shal deuise, Þat no man shal be suspecious To þi persone, nor engynyous To deme amys, how þis mater goth. For be wel ware, þat me were as loth To be diffamed of so false a þing, To knowe þer-of, or be assentynge In any maner, þat þei of þe toun Sholde to me haue suspecioun,— Lat be, lat be,—leuere I hadde deie! We shal þer-for cast a-noþer weie, Oure honour saue, so þat þou &amp; I Shal goon al quyte—I seie þe outterly, Þat nouþer shal be hold[e] partener Of þis thefte, but stond[e] hool &amp; cler What-euere falle, with-outen any shame: For Vlixes shal beren al þe blame Of þis dede and þis þefte also; For men shall sein, whan [þat] it is go, By his engyn &amp; his slei?ti wyle, Þoru? his treynes &amp; his false gyle, Þat he hath stole aweie Palladioun From þe temple, in lesyng of þe toun— Þat, finally, duringe al his lyve Men shal to hym þis falshed ascryve, And al þe gilt arretten his offence! Þat þou and I, only of Innocence, Þoru?-oute þe world of þis iniquite Shal be excused, platly, &amp; go fre. It nedeth not tarie in þis matere, Come of attonys! lo, þi gold is here! For þou ne shalt lenger delaied be. And sith þou seste þat no difficulte Is on no part, pereil nor repref, Shame nor drede, sclaunder nor meschef, Delaie nat to take þis þing on honde!” And first þis prest gan hym to with-stonde Ful my?tely, and seide, for no þinge, Nouþer for praier nor for manacinge, For gold nor good, ne no maner mede He nolde assent to so foule a dede! (Þus he answered at þe prime face.) But ofte sithe it happeth men purchase By ?ifte of good, to speke in wordis pleyn, Þat trouþe in pouert my?t neuer atteyne: For mede more by falshede may conquere Þan title of ri?t, þat men in trouþe lere; And ?iftes grete hertis can encline; And gold, þat may in stele &amp; marbil myne, Þis prestis hert hath so depe graue, Þat Anthenor shal his purpos haue, For to possede þe Palladioun, Þoru? false engyn and conspiracioun Of þis prest, þat called was Tonaunt, Whiche of falshede my?t hym best avaunte, Þat þis relik fro þe temple rent. And to Vlixes Anthenor it sent, Oute of þe toun, in al þe haste he my?t, By a seruaunt secrely by ny?t: Wher-of Troyens mortally dismaied, And þoru? tresoun finally outtraied, Wrou?t by þis prest with couetise blent, False Anthenor beynge of assent. How the translatour compleyneth hym of the transmutacioun and couetousnes of priestes. O Troye, allas! wel maistow mourne &amp; wepe, In compleynynge with hertly si?es depe, Falsly defraudid of Palladioun, And putte for euere oute of pocessioun. O my?ti goddes, þat þe world gouerne, And euery þing þoru? ?our my?t concerne, Ri?t as it is, of ?oure deite, And trouþe &amp; falshed may to-gedre se In euery herte þoru? ?oure puruyaunce, Whi toke ?e nat on þis prest vengaunce?— Þat traitourly, þoru? his iniquite, For gold and good be-traisshed þe cite Of Troye, allas! with-oute more recure. Who shal emforþe any more be sure, Or any place stonde in sikerte, Sith holynesse of so hi?e degre May bene infect &amp; corrupt wiþ mede? Euery hert ou?te quake and drede To sene, allas! by false ypocrisye, Prestis, þat shulde þe worlde exemplifie With good[e] doctrine of perfeccioun, To make so sone a transmutacioun, Of double entent sodeinly to varie! For dout[e]les, ?if þe seintuarie Be pollut founde in conuersacioun, Naked and bare of deuocioun, And þat þe shynyng of her parfit li?t I-turned be by derknes vn-to ny?t, Vn-to what place shal men ferþer go To take ensaumple what hem ou?t[e] do? Certis, þe rote &amp; grounde of euerydel Is couetise—who-so loke wel,— Of whiche þe greyne is so fer y-sowe, Þat who-so list auarice knowe, Amonge prestis he shal it rathest fynde; For þer-with-al þei be maked blynde To her estat, þat þei may nat se. For, in sothnes, þer is no degre Gredier nor more ravynous Of worldly good, nor more coueitous Þan prestis ben to cacche what þei may: For it is goon sithen many day, Þat in her brest ficched was þe rote Of couetise, whiche sit so sote Þat no man may arrace him nor remewe; For at her tail euere it doth hem swe, Þis false werme, moder &amp; norice Of al meschef and of euery vice. For gold is now so shynyng &amp; so bri?t, So percinge eke, &amp; so clere of ly?t, Þat prestis ben with his stremys blent: For, in sothnes, þei ben in her entent Of couetise verray receptacle, And to possede eke þe tabernacle. Her hert is ay so gredy to embrace, Þat auarice haþ his loggyng place Mid of her breste, þis vice of vices alle! Þat causeþ vertu raþest for to falle, Wher he abit, so he can supplaunte. Recorde I take of þe preste Tonaunte, Þat for tresour to Anthenor haþ sold Þe riche relik þat he had in hold, Palladioun, while þei of Troye toun Han gadrid vp abouten enviroun, Of riche and pore þoru?[-out] þe cite, Gold and siluer an huge quantite, Flour &amp; whete to paien her raunsoun. Þe whiche somme of entencioun Þei made kepe wysly and conserve In þe temple þat longeþ to Minerve, Purposynge after, of oon affeccioun, —Þe cite?ens þoru?-oute al þe toun, Hopynge þer-by for to fare þe bet— Vp-on a day, assigned and y-set, To Appollo in her paynym wyse Solempnely make a sacrifise, With slau?ter of bestis, with encence &amp; blood. Off the Meruelous obstacle and wondre perceyued in makyng of their sacrifice to Appollo; and how an Egle dyd bere away their sacrifice. On whiche day, whan þe prestis stood In compas rounde abouten þe autere, And gan to kyndle þe coles bri?t &amp; clere Vp-on þe are, pleinly, as I rede, To offren vp þe bestis þat were dede, In þe flawme and þe grete levene, To Appollo stellefied in heuene,— Whan þei to offre wer most laborious, Þer be-fil two þinges merueilous: Þe first[e] was, þat þe sacrid fire Ne wolde brenne like to her desire, Nor þe flawme vp ascende alofte, Al-be þat þei assai[e]den ful ofte, More þanne ten tyme, &amp; ?it it nolde be; For ay it queinte, þat þei ne my?t[e] se Nou?t but smoky resoluciouns, Horrible and blak, like exalac[i]ouns Of newe lyme whan þat it is meint Wiþ water colde &amp; of his hete queynt,— Þat þei my?te in no maner wyse, For lak of fir, don her sacrifise; For ay þei fonde a wonderful obstacle! And þe nexte was a mor miracle: On her auter whan þei gan to sprede Þe entrailles of bestis þat were dede, To queme Appollo with flawmys [bri?t and] faire, Þer cam anon doun oute of þe ayre A royal egle, ful percinge of his loke, And in his clees þe offringe vp he toke And þe entreylles liggynge enviroun, In his discence makynge swiche a soun, Þat noon so hardy of herte nor manhod, But þat he was astonied þer he stood, And supprised þoru? nerf and euery veyne Of þis merueile and þis cas sodeyne. But þe egle, abidinge þer no more, Ouer þe toun ful hi?e gan to sore, Toward Grekis enhastinge what he my?t, And on her shipes sodeynly a-li?t, And þe entrailles of þe bestis alle Þis egle lete from his clees falle: Wher-of Troyens, whan þei token hede, Dis[a]maied wiþ a mortal drede, By signes han clerly comprehendid Þat her goddes gretly wer offendid Ageyn þe toun, whan þe fire went oute; And for þei wold be putte oute of doute, To be sure what þis merveile ment, To Cassandra in al haste þei went, Fully to han declaracioun, And þer-vp-on plein exposicioun. How Appollo, their god, by many signes and tokynges shewing vn[to] them, perceyuid he was sore displesid for the polucioun of his temple with the blode of Achilles, wich by treason was slayne in the temple. And she tolde hem, platly, oute of drede, Þat þe quenchinge of her fires rede Was vn-to hem a demonstracioun Boþe of Ire and indignacioun Þat Appollo hath to Troye bore, For þe blood þat was shad be-fore Of Achilles, in his temple slawe, Vengably mordrid and y-drawe, With-outen any maner reuerence Or honour done to þe excellence Of Appollo, beynge þer present, Þat þe phane and placis adiacent Wern defouled and pollut with [þe] blood. Wherfore, she seid[e] shortly, it was good Þat þei went on processioun, With herte contrit and deuocioun, To þe toumbe of Achilles at ny?t, Only to fette on her tapris li?t Sacrid fire, brennynge at þe wake, Fully in purpos by assent to make For his mordre satisfaccioun,— “Þe whiche fire be noon occasioun Shal nat quenche, but his flawmys holde, Þoru? noon assaut of stormy wyndes colde; Þe sacrifise vp-on þe autere To-forn Appollo brenne shal so clere.” And þei of Troye wrou?t[e] by her rede. But of þe egle she bad hem taken hede, [Þat] No þinge was but tokne of tresoun, Pronostik and declaracioun, Finally how Troye and Yllyoun Shal turne in haste to destruccioun: For þe fleynge of þis foule royal Ouer þe toun and þe my?ti wal, With his fethres mailed, bri?t, &amp; shene, And þe entreylles in his clees kene, To Troye was a final demonstraunce, Sothfast shewynge &amp; signeficaunce, Þat grace and ewre [and hap] of olde fortune Be lyklyhed my?t[e] nat contvne Nor perseuere in her first[e] ly?t; For alle attonys þei haue take her fli?t,— Palladioun my?t hem nat wiþ-holde, Þat stole was, like as I ?ow tolde; For no man may his fatal chaunce refuse. And Grekis eke faste gan to mvse, And inwardly in her wittes sou?te Of þe entrailles þat þe egle brou?te, And þer-vp-on gan to-gider rowne, Til þat Calchas dide euery þing expowne, And vn-to hem fully gan assure Þat þe fyn of þis aventure Conclude shulde vppon her welfare, And bad also, for no cost þei spare To perseuere and ben of herte stable, By fortune hem silfe to enable, Hem counseillynge to do her besy peyne, Solempnely in haste to ordeyne A certeyn offringe, born oute of þe felde, To faire Pallas with hir cristal shelde, And to hir make a riche sacrifise, As þe story by ordre shal deuyse. How the Traytor Bysshop Calcas ymagined a large horse of brasse, wherin was a M?. knyghtes, fainyng a sacrifice to be done to Paullas. Bysshop Calchas, with his lokkes hore, Traitour forsworn siþen go ful ?ore, Þat falsid haþ trouþe &amp; his lygaunce, Whom clerkis han putte in remembraunce In her bokis, wiþ lettris, olde and newe, To exemplifie no man be vntrewe: For þau? ?eris passe faste a-weye, Ruste of sclaundir li?tly wil nat deye; Þe fret þer-of is so corosif, Þat it lasteþ many mannys lyf, And is ful hard to arrace away; Of whos venym ful selde is made alay— Reporte þer-of blowen is so wyde, Perpetuelly þat it wil abide, Remembrid new &amp; freshly had in mynde. Recorde of hym þat koude a weye fynde: Olde Calchas, evele mote he sterue!— Vnder colour of offringe to Mynerue, To make Grekes entren in-to toun, Þis slei?ti serpent, fader &amp; patroun And fynder-vp of tresoun and of gyle, Compassid hath and y-founde a wyle, How Grekis shal þe cite wynne &amp; take, Pretendynge hem sacrifise to make Vn-to Pallas, as I shal expresse: For þis traitour, merour of falsnesse, Þe Grekis bad for to do her peyne To Minerva an off[e]ringe to feyne, And in al haste þat þei shuld hem spede. And of assent þei dide make a stede, Large and wyde, of coper &amp; of bras, By crafte of Synoun, þat contrived was Þat it my?t resseive large and wel A þousand kny?tes armed bri?t in stel,— Þoru? þe slei?te and þe compassynge, Þe sotil wit &amp; merveillous werchinge Of þis wyse and crafty Greke Synoun,— Whiche, þoru? his castynge and discrecioun, Parformed haþ þis riche stede of bras, As ?e han herd, be biddinge of Calchas, And by thavys of Appivs þe wyse, Þat halpe also þe stede to deuyse, To fyn only þat of deuocioun Grekis my?t requeren of þe toun— Whan it were made—to graunt[e] hem licence It to present in þe reuerence Of my?ti Pallas, in stele armyd bri?t, Amyd hir temple, large &amp; ful of li?t,— By þe offringe to fynde occasioun To haue entre frely in-to toun, By pilgrimage her vowes to fulfille: In whiche stede daren shal ful stille A þousand kny?tes, as Calchas be devis Ordeyned haþ, þat was so sli?e &amp; wys. By crafte of Synoun and of Appivs, Þis large stede, of makynge merveillous, Vnder pretence of oblacioun, Was complet ful to his perfeccioun Of werkemanshipe, as I tolde a-fore, Þe same ?ere þat Troye was for-lore, Whan þe sege, sothly, gan to fyne, And þe cite was brou?t to ruyne Þoru? Grekis my?t; &amp; þe walles stronge Were bete doun, large, þikke, and longe;— Þe whiche ?ere, as made is mencioun, A lite a-forn takynge of þe toun, Kynges echon þat come fro so ferre, A-lyve lefte after þe mortal werre, Whan þei saw how Priam be couenaunte Vn-to Grekis haþ outterly made graunte Al hast possible to paien his ransoun, Þei toke leve, and went oute of þe toun. And first, I fynde, how kyng Philymene With hym ladde þe body of þe quene Pantasillya home to hir contre, Ful richely þer to buried be; And of two þousand kny?tes þat þis kyng Brou?t vn-to Troye first at his comyng, No mo þan fifty home with hym he ladde. And of wommen þat þe quene eke hadde, Of a þousand, þe story seith certeyn, But foure hundrid repeired hom ageyn. And þus whan alle were fro Troie gon, Þe morwe next Priamus anon With his lordis rood oute of þe toun, As was þacord for confirmacioun Of pes final vp-on ouþer syde. And in þe feld Grekis hym abide; And, on relikes openly y-born, Þer þei wern on ouþer parti sworn, On þe forme to ?ow a-fore recorded, As Anthenor with Grekis was accorded. And for Grekis firste swore Diomede, Þei of Troie takynge lytel hede How þe oþe was in condicioun, Cured a-bove vnder false tresoun, Siþen Grekis þo in her sweryng Ne bounde hem silfe to no manere þing To stonde to, as in special, But for to holde &amp; kepe in general Þe poyntes hool engrosid, and no mor, In þilke trete þat daun? Anthenor With Grekis helde, þis traytour fraudelent! In whiche þei werne ful double of entent —Meint with tresoun, as ?e han herd to-forn,— Whiche to obserue only þei wer sworn, By fraude of oþe, &amp; nat by wordis pleyne, Her aduersaries to taken in a treyne, Excludyng hem fro her menyng ferre, Pes in þe face, but in þe herte werre, Al openly confermyd with her hond, Inly to tresoun, by assurance of bond. But þou? þe venym was closid with a wal, It was nat hid from him þat knoweþ al: For, certeynly, so as clerkes teche, Who þat swereth falsly in his speche, Florisshinge outward by a fair colour For to desseive his trewe ne?[e]bour, He is forsworn, what-so-euere he be! Þe tresoun hid þou? men may nat se, How-so þe word be a-way [y-]born: Who swereþ by craft is by craft for-sworn; Þer may be made noon excusacioun. For God þat knoweþ þe entencioun, Demeth þe herte, &amp; þe word ri?t nou?t; For he þe wil knoweþ and þe þou?t Of euery man, ny?e and eke a-fere: Þerfore be war, no man him for-swere, As Grekis dide Troiens to deceyve, Þat þe fraude koude nat conceyve, Supposinge þat þe Grekis hadde be Feithful and trewe of her surete— But no þing oon þei in herte þou?t,— Whiche in þe ende þei ful dere abou?t, Whan þei founde fully þe reuers, And to her speche þe dede so diuers. It were but veyn by &amp; by to write Her feyned oþes, nor her wordis whyte, Nor þe cheris þat þei koude feyne. But, to conclude with, þe quene Eleyne, Duri[n]ge þe trete, vp-on þe same day Delyuered was to kyng Menelay; And after þat, was payed þe raunsoun, Grauntid to-forn and gadrid in þe toun: Gold &amp; siluer, whete &amp; also flour; And to her shippes with dilligent labour, In ful gret hast euery þing was brou?t, Wher-þoru? þe cite after cam to nou?t. And Grekis þanne, by symulacioun, Makyng a colour of deuocioun, Þoru? holynes, vnder ypocrosye, Falsly feyned by fraude &amp; flaterie, Þe kyng han preied to han liberte Frely to entre in-to þe cite, To make a-seth by oblacioun For þe þefte of Palladioun, And offren vp þe riche stede of bras To þe goddes þat called is Pallas, —Whan kyng Priam likeþ to assigne— Þat she to hem be willy &amp; benygne In her repeire seilynge be þe se Home in-to Grece toward her contre, Whan she is quemed with þis large stede. Of whiche, allas! Priam toke noon hede; Þe tresoun hidde he koude nat aduerte, But graunted hem with al his hole herte, Whan þat hem list to bringe it in-to toun,— By false entising and suggestioun Of Anthenor and also of Enee, Havynge no drede nor ambyguyte In his entent, nor suspecioun Nouþer of feynyng nor of fals tresoun, But, ri?t frendly, liche to his beheste, Condescendeth vn-to her requeste, Her avowes þat þei my?t obserue, To offren vp þis hors vn-to Minerue. And Grekis þo, with gret[e] dilligence, Ful gret honour and huge reuerence Han shapen hem with processioun To bringe þe stede in-to Troie toun, Þe men of armys being ay þer-Inne, By whom þei cast Troie for to wynne In short tyme, for it stood on þe date. How the Grekes had licens to breke the walle of Troy, to brynge in their large stede of brasse, to Offer vnto Pallas in sacrifice; &amp; how the knyghtes came oute in the nyght, &amp; betrayde þe citie. And whan þis hors brou?t was to þe gate, It was so narwe þat þer was no space For þe stede in-to þe toun to passe, Al-be þat þei assaied oueral. Wherfore Priam bete adoun þe wal To make it large, ri?t at her devys, In whiche þing, allas! he was vnwis: For cause chef of his confusioun Was þat þis hors cam in-to þe toun. But humblely forþe þei gan procede To þe temple wiþ þis large stede; And to Pallas mekely doun knelynge, Alle attonis þei made her off[e]ringe, With feyned chere and fals deuocioun. Wherof in herte glad was al þe toun, And specially þei þat wern of Troye. But soth is seid, þat ay þe fyn of Ioye Wo occupieth, as men ful ofte se: For vnwarly cometh aduersite After gladnes, and mysaventure, Whan men best wene for to stonde sure. In worldly blis is noon affiaunce, So diuers is his vnhappi chaunce— Ful of deceit, euere meint with trouble, And for to triste variaunt and double, And selde in oon abidinge eny þrowe. For worldly lust, þou? it be now blowe With pompe and pride, &amp; with bost &amp; soun, Anon it passeth: record of Troie toun, Þat wende wel, by þis riche stede To haue be sure &amp; deuoide of drede Perpetuelly, as I haue told to-fore. But whan Grekis han þis hors y-bore To-fore Pallas, as ?e haue herde me telle, Hem liketh nat lenger for to dwelle In þe boundis of þis my?ti toun; But of purpos to þe Greke Synoun Þei haue committed hool þe gouernaille Of þis stede, [þe] whiche wil nat faile, Whan he seth best oportunyte, By his engyn to traisshe þe cite. And Grekis han in þis while founde A newe slei?te hem fully to confounde: Þis to seyn, þei haue made her sonde To kyng Priam, þei wold[e] go fro londe Vn-to þe see toward Tenedoun, And þedir seille, for þis conclusioun: For þat Eleyne, by good avysement, In secre wyse þedir shal be sent; For þei dradde ?if vppon þe londe She were delyuered, shortly, to her honde, Grekis wold of malys done her peyne, Þe more parti to sleen þe quene Eleyne: For she was grounde &amp; gynnynge of her wo, Þe verray rote and þe cause also Of þe slau?tre of many worþi man, Siþen þe tyme þe sege first be-gan. Wherfore, (þei seide) for to stinte al strif, And to be sure for to saue hir lyf, Þe beste was to send hir oute of si?t, Secrely to Tenedoun be ny?t. Þus þei feyned of ful false tresoun, Priam to putte from al suspecioun, Askauns þei wolde neuere after her lyve Resorte ageyn with Troye for to strive —Þus þei made Priam for to wene;— But in þe hond he was deceived clene, Of her deceit knowynge neuere-a-del; For in his herte he þou?t[e] nat but wel, Grauntinge hem al þat my?t hem plese. How the Grekes spoyled and burned the citie of Troy, and after toke shipping; and of their misauenture on þe see. And whanne þei had at leiser &amp; good ese Fro Troye seiled vn-to Tenedoun With her navie, þe false Greke Synoun In Troie waker gan to take kepe Þe hour whan men wern in her first slepe; And, in al haste, wiþ his slei?ty gyn, Many vys and many sotyl pyn In þe stede he made aboute goon, Þe crafty lokkes vndoynge euerychon; And oute [he] goth, &amp; gan anoon to calle With-Inne þe hors þe worþi kny?tes alle, So secrely no man my?t espie; And traitourly he gan hym for to hi?e Vp-on þe walles, þe silfe same ny?t, And toward Grekis gan [to] shewe a ly?t, Where as þei leye to-fore Tenedoun, Redy armyd to falle vppon þe toun. And whan þei hadde þe sodein li?t espied, On hors[e]-bak anoon þei han hem hy?ed Toward Troy, armed clene at al; And in þei went by þe same wal Whiche for þe hors was but late broke; And mortally, for to ben a-wroke, Þe kny?tes eke in þe stede of bras Han with hem mette, a ful sterne pas, And gan anoon þoru?-oute þe cite On euery half for to kylle &amp; slee, With blody swerd vp-on euery side, And made her wondes brode, large, &amp; wyde —While þei, allas! no þing aduertinge, At mydny?t hour a-bedde laie slepynge, Ful Innocent and þou?t[e] nou?t but good— Al for-baþed in her owne blood, Boþe man &amp; childe, with-oute excepcioun, Þe Grekis sparinge no condicioun Of old nor ?ong, womman, wif, nor maide— Þat with þe cry Priamus abraide Oute of his slepe, &amp; sodeynly a-woke, Whiche laye al ny?t &amp; noon hede [ne] toke Of þe slau?ter and mordre in þe toun; But þo he wist þat þer was tresoun Falsly compassid vn-to his cite By Anthenor and also by Enee, Of whos malis he was no mor in doute: For þe venym was now broken oute, And now þe galle of conspirac[i]oun, Þat vnder sugre of symulacioun Hath so longe closid ben and hidde, In dede is now execut and kyd. And now þe fraude fully of tresoun, Þe cast also of false collusioun Be raked oute, and abrood y-blowe, And þe autours openly y-knowe. Now hath envie and contrived hate Of her engyn set a-brood þe gate; Now hath deceit &amp; olde conspiracie And feyned oþes, alle of oon allie, Openly shewed her falsnesse, And disclosid al hir doubilnesse So fer a-brod, þat now is þer no geyn! For now, allas! þe wilde fire is seyn In touris hi?e with þe wynde y-blasid, Wherof Priam, astonyd &amp; amasid, Al awaped sterte oute of his bedde, And counfortles to þe temple is fledde Of Appollo, to saue hym ?if he my?t. And ay þe flawme of þe fires bri?t Brent in þe toun, &amp; conswmeth al Þe riche bildinge, whilom so royal, Þat þe walles with her roves huge, Couered with leed for a chef refuge, Were now, allas! bare &amp; bareyne maked. Þe Grekis ay wiþ her swerdes naked Mordre and sle where-so þat þei go, Þat twenti þousand, þilke ny?t, &amp; mo Þei kylled han, longe or it was day; And in þis slau?ter &amp; þis grete affray Spoile &amp; robbe, &amp; take what þei fynde, Tresour &amp; good, and left[e] nat bi-hinde, Be my?ti hond &amp; sturdi violence. And þe temples, wiþ-oute reuerence Þei han dispoilled þoru?-oute al þe toun, And gredely rent and racid doun Of golde &amp; siluer þe ornementes alle To-fore þe goddes—foule mote hem falle!— Kyng Priam ay with a dedly chere To Appollo makyng his praiere Furiously, þis hertly woful man, As he, in soth, þat no red ne can But waite his deth &amp; his fatal ewre. And Cassandra, þat holy creature, Of inward wo desirous to sterve, Compleynynge ran vn-to Minerve, Makynge to hir a lamentacioun With oþer gentil-wommen of þe toun. And þer, allas! as þei wolde dye, Ful pitously þei sobbe, wepe, and crie. And in her dool þer y lete hem dwelle; For alle her sorwes ?if I shulde telle In þis story, and her wo descrive, Mi penne shuld of verray routhe rive,— Rehersinge eke how in euery strete, Her cloþes blake, rodi, moiste, and wete, As þei, allas! bothen oon and alle, On her lordes doun a-swone falle, With her blod be-dewed &amp; y-spreint,— Wher men may seen þe cristal teris meynt Of her wepinge in þer woundes grene, Þat lay and bledde ageyn þe sonne shene, With dedly eyen castinge vp þe whyte: It were but veyne al her wo to write, Nor þe maner of her mortal sorwe. But Guydo writ, þat þe same morwe, How Anthenor, and with hym [fals] Enee, Conveied han þoru?-oute þe cite Þe my?ti Grekis vn-to Ylyoun, Þe royal tour and riche mancioun Þat whilom was of most excellence; In þe whiche þei founde no diffense Of hi?e nor lowe, nor of noon estat, For it was left allone dissolat, With al þe gold and richesse of þe toun Shet &amp; closed in þe chefe dongoun. But for þer was no man þat with-stood, Þei brake þe lokkes &amp; rau?t [away] þe good And þe tresour þat was shet with-Inne, Eche for his part[y] þat he my?t[e] wynne: Þei ?af no fors who was lef or loth. And Pirrus after to þe temple goth Of Appollo by gret cruelte, And fil on Priam knelynge on his kne, And wiþ his swerd, furious and wood, To-fore þe autere shad[de] þere his blood, Þat þe stremys of his woundys rede So hi?e rau?t, boþe in lengþe and brede, Þat þe statue of gold bornyd bri?t Of þis Appollo, for al his grete my?t, For al his power and his sterne face, Defouled was, and pollut al þe place— Only by deth of þis worþi kynge By Pirrus slayn while he lay knelynge, Of olde hatrede &amp; envious pride, While Anthenor and Enee stod be-side— Þat routhe was and pite to beholde, To sen hym lyn on þe stonys colde, So pitously to-forn þe auter blede. Where-of, allas! whan Eccuba toke hede, And hir dou?ter, faire Polycene, With here to-rent, as any gold wyr shene, Inly supprised wiþ sorwe to þe herte, Whan þei began considren and aduerte Þe noble kyng, [with] blody stremys rede Al fordrowned, his eyen dirke &amp; dede, Wiþ Pirrus swerd girt þoru? ouþer side,— For mortal fere þei durst[e] nat abide; But inwardly þoru?-darted with þe si?t, Al in a rage toke hem to þe fli?t. And ?it, in soth, þoru?-oute þe cite Þei wist[e] neuer whiderward to fle, Reskus was noon nor no remedie Of kyn nor frend, nor of noon allie; With Grekis swerd þe toun was so be-set. And, in her fli?t, þis woful quen haþ met Eneas, causer of al þis wrak, Vn-to whom, rebukynge, þus she spak: “O þou traitour, most malicious! Þou false serpent, adder envious! Crop and rote, fynder of falsnesse, Sours and welle of vnkyndenesse, How my?testow in þin herte fynde Vn-to þi kyng to be so vnkynde?— Gynner and ground, exaumple of tresoun, And final cause of oure destruccioun! How my?t[e]stow, devoide of al pite, Be hold, allas! þoru? þi cruelte Of þi kyng to shede so þe blood, Þat euere haþ ben so gentil &amp; so good, So gracious lord, specialy to the! And, ouermore, þoru? his hi?e bounte The honoured and y-magnified Al his lyve—it may nat be denyed— Þat liþ now ded in þe temple, allas! Þou wer nat only traitour in þis cas, But to his deth conspiryng &amp; vnkynde, Pirrus conveiyng where he shuld h[i]m finde, To-forn Appollo myd of þis cite, Where þou sholdest of verray duete Raþer haue ben his protectioun, His my?ti sheld and sauacioun— Þat hast þis cite &amp; þis toun y-lorn In whiche þou were fostrid &amp; y-born, On þe gretest of reputacioun Of alle þe lordis dwellyng in þis toun, In whiche þou haddest whilom most plesaunce! But al is now oute of remembraunce! ?it in þin herte ?if any drope be Of gentilnesse, merci, or pite, In þis dedly rage ful of tene, Rewe on my dou?ter, ?ong[e] Polycene, From Grekis swerd hir ?ouþe for to save, —?if þin herte may eny rouþe haue,— Of manly pite on hir maydenhede Diffende hir now &amp; kepe hir oute of drede, ?if þou canst fynde any weye, In any wyse þat she may nat deye, Þat her-after, whan men sen and rede Þe false tresoun and þe foule dede Þat þou hast don vn-to Troye toun, It may in parti be proteccioun To þi fame, þe venym to allaye Of þis tresoun;—whan men wiln assaie By iust report þi name to accuse, Þis dede may [þe] helpen to excuse Ageyns tonges þat speken of Enee: Þan wiln þei seyn, þou haddist ?it pite On Polycene, only of gentilnes,— Þer-with to sugre al þe bitternesse Of þi decert, blowe forþe by fame, By rehersaille of þe foule blame Þat shal of þe þoru? þe world be born, With sclaunder infect whan þou art al to-torn, Þat þou ne shalt þe shame mowe sustene!— Þan shal my dou?ter faire Polycene Be þi defence ageyns swiche famus strif, ?if it so be now þou saue hir lyf— Of me no fors—þou? þou make as blive Þe swerde of Grekis þoru? myn hert[e] rive.” And so by praier of þis woful quene, Þis Eneas toke to hym Polycene, Whos traitour hert, for al his cruelte, On hir ?ouþe was mevid of pite, Only of rouþe þat in his brest aros, And secrely putte hir vp in clos, List þat Grekis founde occasioun Ageyn[e]s hym. &amp; Aiax Thelamoun Toke to his warde Andronemecha, Ectoris wyf, and wyse Cassandra Oute of þe temple longinge to Minerue, From Grekis swerd her lyves to conserue. And Menelay toke þe quene Eleyne In-to his garde, for whom so grete a peyne Bood in his hert many day to-forn, By whom, allas! þe cite is now lorn. And Grekes ay were besy in her Ire To sleen and kylle, &amp; cruelly to fire On euery side and to bete doun Palais &amp; house &amp; walles of þe toun: Þei spare nou?t, for al goth to þe fire, So feruent hate brent in her desire Of olde envie avenged for to be, Þat þei ne lefte with-Inne þe cite No þing vnbrent; and also Ylyoun Was in þis rage turned vp-so-doun. Þer maked wern noon excepciouns, Only outake þe possessiouns Of Anthenor (evele mote he fare) And Eneas, whom þe Grekis spare, As þei to hem were bounde by her oþe. And þus þe Grekis, furious &amp; wroþe, Han al þat day robbed and y-brent, Til þat þe kyng Agamenoun haþ sent For his lordis to assemble I-fere In Pallas temple, only for to here Her wyse avis vppon þinges tweyne: First, ?if þei wolde holde, &amp; nat feyne, Holy her feith, with-oute excepcioun, To hem by whom þei wan first þe toun? And, ouermore, he axed hem also, Touching þe goodis, what þei wold[e] do With gold, tresour, and possessioun Þat þei haue wonne þoru? her hi?e renoun? And þei answerid, with-oute more tariyng, Þei wolde her feith kepe in euery þing As þei wer sworn, &amp; her hestis holde; And, ouer þis, þei seide [how] þei wold Þat gold, tresour, and good of þe cite, As ri?t requereth and also equyte, Be iustly partid by diuisioun, To euery wy?t made distribucioun Liche his merit, of hi?e &amp; lowe degre; And þat þe kyng eke of resoun se Eche to rewarde after his labour, So as it longeth to a conquerour, Þat no man haue mater to compleyne. And so þei fil in spekynge of Eleyne, Eueryche after his oppinioun; And to-forne alle Aiax Thelamoun Shortly seide she haþ deserued deth, For whom so many haþ ?olden vp þe breth, Pleinly affermynge þer in parlament, Of ri?twisnesse and trewe iugement She shulde nat eskape with þe lyf, Þat gynnyng was &amp; cause of al her strif, Rote and grounde of al her sorwe &amp; wo; And so seide eke many a-noþer mo. And for þe noyse and þe grete affraye, Agamenoun nor kyng Menelay Ne durste a worde for her parti meve To saue þe quene, list Grekis wold hem greve, Ageyn[e]s hem þer was so gret rumour. Til Vlixes, chefly hir socour, Þoru? his wit and his elloquence, His deuer dide and his dilligence To saue hir lyf, and fully to purchace Of þe Grekis for to gete hir grace. And, as Guydo also doth vs lere, Agamenoun gan Grekis to [r]equere To graunten hym, for a chef guerdoun, Of Cassandra to han possessioun, Al her lyve wiþ hym to abide. Eke Eneas &amp; Anthenor beside Of Elenus to þe Grekis tolde, How to þe werre he neuere assent[e] wolde, And how þat he, prudent &amp; vertuous, In counseillyng was contrarius To alle þo, of hi?e and lowe estat, In Troye first þat be-gan debate A-twixe Grekis and þis my?ti toun; Eke by his helpe and mediacioun Achilles was buried and y-graue, Þe dede cors from houndes for to saue, Whan he was slayn in ful cruel wyse By ny?ter tyme, as ?e han herd deuise: For, sothly, he and Cassandra boþe Of þis mordre in herte were ful wroþe And sory eke of many anoþer þing Wrou?t in þe toun with-oute her wytinge. And for þei wer of malys Innocent, Þe Grekis han fully by assent Graunted to hem a prerogatif By parlement for to han her lyf. But Elenus, first in teris drowned, To-fore þe kyng pitously haþ swowned, And abraidinge, with a dedly face, In humble wyse besou?t him of his grace, Of kny?tly pite to haue his aduertence To spare his swerde fro blood of Innocence, And of merci þat he nat disdeyne To graunt[e] lyf to þe sones tweyne Of worþi Hector, his broþer moste entere, And eke to rewe on her moder dere, Only of grace, þat she be nat ded,— A wido lefte, allone, and can no red, And wot not whider þat she may diuerte. And so þe kyng, ameved in his herte Of his wordis and his woful chere, Benignely graunted his praiere, And ?af eke lyf &amp; fredam for to go To þe moder and hir childer two; And to þe ladies &amp; gentil-wommen alle Þat for mercy to his grace calle, He graunted eke of compassioun A saufconduit and a fre pardoun, Where þat hem list in þe toun abide, Or in þe contre adiacent beside— He put it hool in her eleccioun. And, þankyng hym, þei fel on knees doun With many tere dewed in þe face; And so þe kyng parteth fro þe place. And after þat, Grekis ri?t a-noon Fully purpos to schip[pe] for to goon, In haste to seile toward her contre. But swiche a tempest roos vp in þe see, Of wawe &amp; wynde &amp; of cloudes blake, Al a moneth þat þei dar nat take Þe water salt, for drede þat Neptunus Of verray Ire, and also Eolus Was vn-to hem in euery þing contrarie, Þat on þe lond made hem longe tarie— Þe se was ay so fel and boilynge: Til þat Grekis of Calchas enqueringe By on assent, what it my?t[e] be, Þat euere in oon so diuers was þe se In his rage boþe at eve and morwe?— And he answered (God ?eve hym evele sorwe, Þis olde shrewe, with al his prophesie, Þat can so wel whan him list to lye!) How þis tempest caused was at al By þe goddes and furies infernal, Þat neuere wolde apese nor be stille Til þe mordre, platly, of Achille Avenged be, &amp; shedynge of his blood. For whiche (he seide) Appollo was eke wood, For his temple to hym consecrat Was þoru? his deth in Troye violat: Wherfore þer muste þoru? redempcioun By blood ageyn be made satisfaccioun Of hir þat was rote in special, Þoru? hir bewte, and original, Cause of his deth—?onge Polycene— And gynnynge first of his mortal tene; Þerfore to Appollo she mut [vp] offrid be, By sacrifice to queme his deiete, With deth ageyn to make recompense, Ri?t as by deth first was thoffense: Þis Grekis muste outterly fulfille, ?if þei desire for to han at wille Þe large se to seillen in quiete. And Pirrus þo, in a furious hete, Gan enquere aboute of euery man For Polycene; but no wy?t telle can Of hir a word, nor, shortly, wher she was, Sauf some seide how þat Eneas And Anthenor hadde hid hir preuely, Wher-of þer ros amonge hem sodeynly Swiche a grucchinge of Grekis al aboute, Of her lyf þat þei wern in doute, So inwardly þis þing þei toke at gref. Til Anthenor (God ?eue him euele pref! Þat may of tresoun as wardein ber þe keie), To shewen oute his malis euery weie, So longe hath sou?t, til in a chaumbre olde He hath hir founde, and þe Grekis tolde, And brou?t hir forþe vn-to her presence, By cruel force &amp; hatful violence, With-oute pite or compassioun, And hir deliuered to Agamenoun. And he, allas! by hasti Iugement, With-oute respit or avisement, Shortly hath dempte þat she shal be ded, Þat was flouringe in hir maidenhed. And for to don execusioun, She was assigned by Agamenoun Vn-to Pirrus; &amp; he of tyranye Ladde hir forþe, &amp; fast[e] gan hym hi?e To þe place where she shulde deye. Gret was þe pres, þat in al þe weye Gan crowde &amp; shoue to beholde &amp; sene Þis ?onge maide, faire Polycene, Þat for hir bewte &amp; hir semlynesse, Hir wommanhed and excellent fairnesse— Of al y-fere whan þei token hed— Þei hadden rouþe þat she shulde be ded, With-oute gilt or any more trespas,— Where men may sen vppon many face Þe salt[e] teris faste falle doun, Of verray pite and compassioun. For man nor child was noon so harde of herte, But he felt for hir sake smerte, Hir goodly face whan þei beholde &amp; se, And fayn[e] wolde, ?if it my?t haue be, Delyuered hir of verray force anoon From Pirrus hond, but for þei wende echon With-oute hir deth neuer to han repeir In-to Grece, nor þe wedir fair, As Calchas had made suggestioun And brou?t hem alle in oppinioun. And at þe last, whan þis Polycene, Of dede &amp; wil a verray maide clene, Was to þe graue of Achilles brou?t, She kneleth doun, &amp; with an humble þou?t Caste vp hir eye &amp; gan si?en ofte, And to þe goddes, humblely &amp; softe, With dredful herte and deuocioun, Made in þis wyse hir lamentacioun. How Cruele Pirrus, tavenge þe dethe of his fadire, dismembred yonge Pollycene, and threwe here blode abowt his fadirs grave. And of þe sorwful lamentacyon þat she made to the goddys. “O?e almy?ti, þat þis world gouerne, And euery þing considren &amp; discerne, By whom þis world, so huge, large, &amp; rounde, Boþe eyr &amp; see, heuene &amp; eke þe grounde At ?oure devis with a word was wrou?t, And sothfastly knowen euery þou?t, Ri?t as it is, of euery maner wy?t, With-oute lettinge, so percynge is ?oure si?t, Þat no þing is conseled nor y-wrye From þe beholdyng of ?oure eternal eye, And euery þing may attonis se,— Vp-on my soule hath merci and pite!

I am astonid, sothly, whan I rede, After hir deth, how it dide hym good, Like a tiraunte to cast abrood hir blood, Or a tigre, þat can no routhe haue, Rounde enviroun aboute his fadris graue He spreint of hate and of cruelte. O þou Pirrus! þou maist [ful] wel [y-]be Achilles sone by lyneal discent; For like to hym of herte &amp; of entent Þou wer, in soth, deuoide of al pite, And wers þan he ?it in o degre: For of þi fader in al his lyvynge Ne redde I neuere ?it so foule a þing —Þou?

I fynd[e] wel þat he hadde his part Whilom in loue of Cupides dart, Þat made hym sore in his lyue smerte, Whan þat he was wounded to þe hert With þe castyng only of an eye, Wenynge þer-by wistly for to deye— He my?t[e] nat þe sodeyn stroke eskape; And afterward, as his fate hath shape, He mordrid was for loue of Polycene, Whom þou hast sleyn in þi cruel tene, Furiously, with-oute routhe or shame: For whiche þing þe foule hatful fame Þoru? al þe world her-after shal be sprad, Whan þis story rehersid is and rad; Þan shal be seide, how Pirrus rouþeles Slowe in his Ire a maide gilt[e]les, And warie shal þi name most odible For þis dede passingly horrible, For loue only of faire Polycene. Þe deth of whom whan Eccuba þe quene Hath seyn, allas! as she be-side stood, For verray wo gan to wexe wood, And for sorwe oute of hir wit she went, And hir cloþes &amp; hir heer she rent Al in [a] rage, and wot nat what she doth, But gan anoon with hondis &amp; with toþe In her furie cracchen and eke byte, Stonys caste, and with fistes smyte Whom she mette; til Grekis made her binde, And sent hir forþe, also, as I fynde, In-to an Ile to Troye pertenent, Wher she was slayn only by Iugement Of þe Grekis, and stonyd to þe deth. And whan she had ?olden vp þe breth, Þis woful quene, by cruel auenture, Þe Grekis dide make a sepulture Coriously of metal and of stoon, And toke þe cors and buried it anoon With gret honour and solempnite, Þat longe after men þer my?t[e] se Þe riche toumbe, costful and royal, Þere set and made for a memorial Of Eccuba, whilom of gret[e] fame; And after ?af to þat place a name, And called it, to be long in mynde, Locus infestus, in Guydo as I fynde. And þus þe quene, only for sorwe wood, Whan hir dou?ter had[de] shad hir blood, Of Grekis stonyd dide hir ende make, As ?e han herde, pleinly, for þe sake Of Polycene, whilom by Calchas Vn-to Appollo falsly offrid was, By Pirrus swerd Achilles avengynge, To make þe se calm &amp; blawndisshinge, Þat þe goddes take no vengaunce Vp-on Grekis.

Here may ?e sen how þe venym bites, At þe ende, of swiche olde rytes, By evidence of þis noble toun. What may availle now Palladioun? What may now helpe her frauded fantasie Of al her olde false ydolatrie? Allas, [allas!] þei bou?t it al to sore. Now fare wel Troye, farwel for euere-more! Farwel, allas! to cruel was þi fal!

For ?if ?e list of resoun for to se, At þe sege leide first to þis cite I haue my silfe in double wyse aquit, As wel by kny?thod, sothly, as by wit, And þoru? my counseil &amp; my besy cure Ben oft cause of her discounfeture, Ay dilligent to ?oure avauntage, Wrou?t &amp; compassid [vn-]to her damage, Þat to þis day, in soth, ne hadde I be, Þei had floured in her felicite, In her force contuned and welfare. And ?if þat I þe trouþe shal nat spare, ?if it be dempt &amp; loked of resoun, I was most cause of her confusioun, Who-so-euere ageyn[e]s it replie! How ofte went I on embassatrie, With importable costis &amp; dispense, Þe trete ay concludinge in sentence To þe forþering of ?oure entencioun, And disencrese &amp; hindringe of þe toun! And whan I sawe oþer mene noon, In myn avis and wittis euerychon, By oure force þe cite for to wynne While þei hadde þe relik hem with-Inne, Þer-vp-on so sotilly y wrou?t, Þat vn-to ?ow Palladyoun I brou?t,— Whiche Thelamoun, þat of malis stryveth, Of olde hatrede vn-to my gilt ascriveþ Hooly þis þing þat I haue for ?ow wrou?t. But ?e, þat ben so prudent in ?oure þou?t, Aduerteth wisly and an ende maketh, And in ?oure hond þis quarel fully takeþ, Palladyoun iustly to prouyde, And al favour late be leide a-side Sith al þis þing ?e platly vnderstonde, And lete vs boþe to ?oure demynge stonde By oon assent, how-so þe mater wende— Lo, here is al—my tale is at an ende.” Þanne Thelamoun, in Ire ful feruent, Of [inward] hate made inpacient, And of envie inwardly amevid, Vlixes hath [de]spitously reprevid, Only of malis and of hi?e disdeyn; And Vlixes rebukyng him ageyn Ful bitterly, with-oute abood anoon,— And so þei tweyne made ful mortal foon In þe presence of Agamenoun. But furiously Aiax Thelamoun, Of malencolie pale &amp; no þing red, Þratte Vlixes þat he shal be ded Of his hondis—he shuld it nat eschewe! And Grekes þo, al rancour to remewe, Þis quarel putte in arbitracioun Of Menelay and Agamenoun, Þat caused after a ful mortal strif: For, be sentence anoon diffinitif, Þei putte Vlixes in possessioun Perpetuelly of Palladyoun, With hym confermyng to abide stable. And cause why þei were favourable To Vlixes, lyche as Guydo writ, Was for þat he so goodly hath him quit Vn-to Eleyne at getyng of þe toun, Beynge in cause of hir saluacioun, Dispeired and of hir lyf in drede, Grekis willinge to haue had hir dede. But þoru? his prudent mediacioun, Maugre þe my?t of þis Thelamoun, He hath þe quene fro [þe] deth preservid, Al-be þat she hadde it wel deseruyd, As Grekis seide in þeir oppinioun. And þus diffrauded of Palladyoun, As ?e haue herde, was þis worþi kny?t, For al his manhod &amp; his grete my?t; Wher-þoru? þer gan in his hert[e] brede Passinge envie &amp; ful gret hatrede, And þou?t he wolde avengid be som day Vp-on Vlixes and on Menelay, And eke also vp-on Agamenoun; And oute he brak like a wode lyoun, With his kny?tes aboute him þat wer stronge, And seide, pleinly, of þis grete wronge, For to be ded, he wolde avenged be, And specially on þis ilke þre. And þer-with-al, furious and wroth, Tornynge his bak oute anon he goth, In herte fret with ful mortal tene, With many Greke his quarel to sustene, Þat in herte sore gan disdeyne Ageyn Vlixes and þe toþer tweyne. But þei ful war, what-so-euere falle, Her kny?tes made aboute hem for to calle, And with gret stuf, wher þei wake or slepe, To waite on hem &amp; manly for to kepe With ful good wache enviroun al þe cloos. But ful erly or þe sonne aroos, Þis worþi Aiax in his bed vp-ri?t I-mordrid was, þe silue same ny?t, And al be-bled in þe morwe founde, On pecis hewe with many mortal wounde,— Þat for þis þing, cruel and horrible, To God &amp; man lothsom &amp; odyble, Ful many Greke þat woful morwe wep To sen a kny?t so mordrid in his slep, Þat þe cri and þe noise ran Þoru?-oute þe hoste anon fro man to man. And for constreint of þis foule dede, Eueryche of hem felt his herte blede, Ful desirous to make an ordinaunce On þis mordre for to do vengaunce, Havinge þer-of gret suspecioun To Menelay and Agamenoun, But to Vlixes moste in special, By comoun vois to him arettinge al,— Þe foule fame he my?t[e] nat asterte. But Pirrus moste toke þis þing at herte, Makynge a vowe, furious and wood, To be vengid, pleynly, on þe blood Of Thelamoun, vp-on Vlixes hed, Hym manascinge þat he shal be ded, So sore on hym freting was þe sorwe. But Vlixes erly on a morwe, For drede of Pirrus taken hath þe se, And with his shippes fast[e] gan to fle. But or he went, platly, as I rede, Palladyoun he toke to Dyomede, Hauynge in herte a ful gret remors. And Pirrus þanne taken hath þe cors Of Thelamoun, for loue in special, And dide make a flawme funeral, Large &amp; gret, of colis hoot &amp; rede; And amyddes þe feruent firy glede, Ful many Greke stondynge to biholde, He let hit brenne in-to asshes colde. And, in þe story after as Is tolde, He closed hem in an vrne of golde Ful reuerently, &amp; after hath it shet; And þer-vp-on he hath þe prent [y-]set Of his armys, coriously y-graue, From al meschef þe asshes for to saue, And sent hem home by gret affeccioun To be conserued in þe regioun Where he was kyng while he was a-lyue; And euery þing was parformed blive, After þe rytes in þo daies vsid. And euere in oon Pirrus hath y-mvsid Vp-on þe mordre traitourly y-wrou?t, And caste it shulde be ful dere abou?t, Þe pitous deth of þis Thelamoun, Hauynge ay herte to Agamenoun, And hadde eke suspect olde Menelay,— Þat in a-wait eche for oþer lay, Makynge hem silfe with her kny?tes strong, To trien oute who hath ri?t or wrong: For Pirrus nolde lete it li?tly goon. And þus þei wern maked mortal foon, Þis ilke þre, platly, to þe deth, Þoru? false envie whiche her hertes sleth. And while þei wern among hem silfe vntrewe, Strif vp-on strif gan euery day renewe, And debatis for to mvltiplie, Til Anthenor gan þis þing espie, And, by his wisdam, to stinten al disdeyn Hem recounciled vn-to pes ageyn, And caused hem to accorde in al, And after made a feste ful royal, Beseching hem ful lowly, alle þre, To graunten hym þer-at for to be, Of gentilnesse, þat Grekis my?t echon Outward conceive þat þei were al oon. And to þis feste he manly made calle, As writ Guydo, þe worþi Grekis alle— Of hi?e nor lowe was noon excepcioun. But ?if I shulde make descripcioun, How þe lordes and estates sete, Of sondry coursis, &amp; þe ?iftes grete Þat Anthenor ?af on euery side, It were to longe to ?ou for to abide, Þer was of plente so gret suffisaunce. And, I finde, þei fil in daliaunce, Sittinge at mete, to speken of Enee, Brou?te In of hate &amp; of enmyte, And of disdeyn, shortly in sentence,— Þei putte on him many grete offence, And specially, in her hasti tene, Whilom how he conceiled Policene, And by his slei?te made hir be withdraw, Which was in cause Achilles was slawe— Shortly concluding, by oon oppinioun, His final exile oute of Troie toun, Not-with-stondinge þe graunt &amp; liberte ?oven to hym tabide in þe cyte, Al-so longe as hym list deuise. But Grekis han annullid his fraunchise, Fro þe lowest vp on-to þe meste, Þat wern present at þis hi?e feste; But dout[e]les I can nat wel espie By whom was wrou?t þis conspiracie, In Troie boke I finde can no more, Saue þat hym silfe witte it Anthenor— I-liche false boþe in o degre, As ?e haue herd, betraisshinge þe cite, Liche as þei hadde spronge out of o rote! And whan he knewe þer was noon oþer bote, Þis Eneas his dome to modifie, He preied hem of her curtesie, At þe lest for to graunte him grace Foure monþes, þat he my?t haue space To make his stuf &amp; his apparaille, And hym silf to purueie of vitaille,— Eke to graunte hym þat þei wold assent Þilke shippes þat with Paris went To Cytheroun, vn-to þat temple olde, Þat wern in noumbre two &amp; twenti tolde. And with ful graunt of his peticioun, He is retourned home to Troye toun, Triste and heuy to sen &amp; beholde Þe waste cite with his wallis olde, And for sorwe felt his herte blede, With-Inne hym silfe whanne he takeþ hede And remembrid in his aduertence Þe false tresoun and þe grete offence By hym compassid to þe toun a-forn, And how þat he so sodeinly hath lorn Þe grace of Grekes, &amp; stood discounsolat, Þat whilom was of so gret estate, Now in his herte fully dissepeired, Þat he vnwarly was so euele appaired Vn-to Grekis behinden at his bak, Beinge vngilti and with-outen lak; And be whom he koude nat wel deme, Saue be signes, as it dide seme, Þat Anthenor was most for to wyte, And caste pleinly þat he wolde hym quyte. Howe Eneas, beyng still in Troy, councelled the Troyans to sende for A[n]thenor, and to make hym their kyng. And þoru? þe toun he made sende blive For þilke fewe þat were lefte a-lyve, Comynge anoon at his commaundement; And whan þei wern euerychon present: “Sirs,” quod he, “?e sen how þat Fortune Towardis me gynneth discontune, Ay vnstable with hir eyen blynde, As ?e expert in ?oure silfe now fynde, Whilom froward, now turned in-to werse, Þat of clerkis called is aduerse, Whan hir list hir cruelte to shewe. Now it stant so: ?e be her but a fewe, And I mvt parte, and ?e stille abide; But it so be þat ?e wil prouide, Stondynge allone deuoide of al socour, Amonge ?our silf to make a gouernour, I can nat se but ?e shal be acloied On euery parte, &amp; finally distroied, A[s] sely shepe, þat ne can no rede, Al disparpiled, whiche stond in grete drede. Wherfore, best is, in þis dredful þing, By oon assent to chese ?ow a kyng; And most able þestat to occupie, From al assaut manly ?ow to guye Is Anthenor, of kny?thod &amp; renoun,— ?if it accorde with ?oure oppinioun. Wherfore in haste, vn-to þis entent, With-oute abood late hym fore be sent; And, at his comynge, pleinly, in-to towne, Vp-on his hed lat be set a crowne, Grauntynge to hym scepter and regally, By his wysdam þat he may ?ou guy From al assa?t of any perturbaunce, By his kny?thod and prudent gouernaunce.” And þei assent, makynge no delay; Þer was neuer oon þat likeþ to seie nay, But wer ri?t glad in al manere þinge, As ?e han herde, for to make him kyng. But þei ful litel, sothly, in her sonde, Of Eneas þe menynge vndirstonde, For he ne ment but tresoun &amp; falsehede, How at his ent[e]ringe he shal be dede— Ful traitourly in a-wait liggynge To slen hym falsly at his [in-]comynge. But Anthenor, of al þis no þing war, Disarmyd cam &amp; no wepne bar; And Eneas with an huge route With swerdis drawe set hym rounde aboute, Til þei of Troie, boþe ?onge &amp; olde, Ran a-twen &amp; manly hym with-holde, And on her knees fil[le] mekely doun, Besechinge hym to haue compassioun, Of worþines &amp; also of manhede, Liche as a kny?t for to taken hede How þei were lefte but of peple bare, Besechinge him his dredful swerd to spare, And his rancour &amp; his Ire leve, List þe slau?ter wolde hem alle greve, And on þe comoun þei besou?t him rewe. Quod Eneas, “is he nat vntrewe? Is he nat double, traitour, &amp; eke fals, Worþi to bene honged by þe hals, Of al deceit &amp; of fraude welle, Amonge no comoun worþi for to dwelle? Hath he nat be chef occasioun Of ?oure vndoynge &amp; destruccioun? And of newe, þis serpent which her goth, Vndisservid made þe Grekis wroth Ageyn[e]s me, by false collusioun, And myn exile conspired fro þe toun, Whiche may nat be repellid nor withdrawe! But with my swerd first he shal be slawe, Þat his falshede may finally be dauntid, Ri?t as he haþ me traitourly supplauntid, Þe Grekis mevyng, fer oute of þis Ile, By his engyn me, pleinly, to exile, Where-as I caste, ?if it my?t haue be, Boþe in Ioie and in aduersite To haue had my part, what[-so] had[de] falle, Duringe my lyf, her amonge ?ou alle. But he, þoru? whom al is wronge &amp; kourbid, Of my desire hath þe fyn perturbid, Whiche in myn herte abideþ alwey grene. Was he nat cause eke þat Pollicene I-slawe was at Achilles graue?— And for al þis, ?it ?e wolde hym save! But outterly þer shal no mene geyne, Who-so-euere þer ageyn[e]s pleyne, Þat he, whos hert al tresoun haþ compiled, Perpetuelly shal now ben exiled Oute of þis toun—þer shal hit no man lette!” And by assent þei his tyme sette, Whiche he shold for no raunsom passe: Þis was þe fyn, he get noon oþer grace. Þus boþe fals, as broþer like to broþer, Eueryche of hem haþ exiled oþer, Traitours boþe to Troye þe cite, Þis Anthenor &amp; with hym eke Enee. But Anthenor gan hym redy make, And in al haste hath þe see y-take With many Troian in gret apparaille. Þe wynde was good, &amp; he gan to saille By many cost &amp; many sondry yles— It nedeth nat rehersen alle þe myles, Nor þe perelles, pleinly, whiche þat he At gret meschef eskaped in þe se,— I haue no Ioie þer-vppon to dwelle, His auentures by &amp; by to telle. But, shortly, he in a litel while Arived vp at a noble Ile Þat whilom was Corbodya y-called, Where he bilt a cite strongly walled, As writ Guydo, large, wide, &amp; longe, Vp-on a roche, which passingly [was] stronge, Whiche had enviroun, as myn auctour tellis, Wodis, rivers, and many lusty welles, And had plente of al maner þing. And Thetides called was þe kyng Þat helde in pes his scepter &amp; his crowne, On whom Fortune list nat for to frowne, But fauourable fully to his wille, Conseruynge hym in pes &amp; [in] tranquille, With-oute trouble many [a] day a-for,— To whom accepted was þis Anthenor, And ri?t welcome, as þe story seith, And vn-to hym confederat by feith, Fully assured, be-cam his lige man, Whom Thetides in al þat euere he can, Þis worþi kyng, dide magnefie. And from Troye gret noumbre of his allie Þer cam in soth to visite hym and se, And tenhabite þis my?ti stronge cite, Ful coriously bilt of lym and stoon, In þilke daies called Menelon,— To whiche he dide gret riches acroche —Be-side þe se set vp-on a roche— And besi was with plente it tastore. Of þis traitour what shuld I write more? With his name my penne is so accloyed, By whos falshed Troye was distroied, As in þe story ?e haue rad &amp; seyn. But now most I pleinly resort ageyn, And to reherse do my besi cure, How Cassandra told euery auenture Þat to þe Grekis after shuld[e] falle; And how þat she told amonge hem alle, As she þat was prudent &amp; vertuous, Þat traitourly with-Inne his owne hous Agamenoun shulde mordrid be: Þat fatal ende for no þing my?t he fle. Lat hym be war, &amp; prudently prouide; For in þis lyf he shal nat longe abide, Ageyn his fate was noon oþer red. Eke Guydo writ, whan Thelamoun was ded By fals mordre (as ?e han herd to-forn), Two sonis he had of sondri wyves born, Þat wer comitted to be [in] kepynge With worþi Theutre, a ful manly kyng, Þat norisshed hem, þe stori seith for soþe, Til þei after were worþi kny?tes boþe: Þe ton of hem called Anthenicus, And þe toþer hi?t Antyssacus, Of shap ful semly &amp; wonder fair of face. And shortly here Guydo doth forþe pase, And list of hem no lenger processe make, But bringeþ in, how Menelay haþ take His leue of Grekis, with Agamenoun, Eueryche to saille to his regioun, With many a Greke in her companye. And þou? Grekis first gan hem denye, At þe last with instaunce and peyne Þei had leue to seille boþe tweyne. And to þe se þei faste gan hem hi?e, Mid of autumpne, whiche is cold &amp; drye, Melencolyk of compleccioun,— Whan Phebus is passed þe Lyoun, Þe heuenly beste, þe beste moste royal, And half y-ronne þe signe virginal, Whiche after somer is naked &amp; bareyn, Whan Ceres hath ful riped euery greyne, Þe tyme of ?ere ful straunge &amp; [ful] diuers,— And sondri floures, rede, white, &amp; pers, Þe whiche in May so lusti wern &amp; glade, Vp-on her stalke gynne droupe &amp; fade, And enclyne her freshe lusty cheris At goynge oute of þe caniculeris,— Whan wykked humours inwardly habounde, With sodeyn fevere folkis to confounde, To maken hem in an accesse shake; And of custom wyndes gynne wake, Boþe bowe &amp; leef causing for to falle, On þe tyme whan folk to Bachus calle From storme &amp; reyn her grapis to conserue, Þat hidous tempest make hem nat to sterue, Nor no duresse of fretinge of no frost, Where-þoru? ful ofte moche fruit is lost, And also eke with þondringe &amp; with levene, Whiche vnwarly smyte fro þe heuene,— Þe se ful ofte with swiche wedris kene Boilyng vp with many wawes grene, Roringe &amp; row?e, &amp; froward to manace, And passingly perlous by to passe, Al-be þat it be blandyssinge a while, Þe dredful calm, þou? it be smoþe &amp; smile, Þer is no trust þat it will long abide. Off A grete tempest of thonder &amp; lytenynge that came to the nauye of Greekes, that brente and drowned .ccxxij. of their Shippes. Recorde of Grekis, þat swiche a lusty tide Þe se han take &amp; be-gan to saille With al her stuf and her apparaille Home in-to Grece, ful many lusti man, With al þe gold &amp; tresour þat þei wan At þe sege, and infinit richesse. And daies þre, devoide of al distresse, Þe se obeyed fully to her wille, Devoide of trouble and of wedris ille: For þei [ful] lusti with-Inne shippes bord, Þe foure wyndes beinge of accord Hem to conveie to euery maner cost. But gladly euere whan men trust[e] most Vn-to Fortune to stonden in her grace, She sodeinly change can her face, Smyle a-forn &amp; mowen at þe bak; For she vnwarly turned al to wrak, Þis chaunteresse &amp; þis stormy quene: For whan Grekis effectuously best wene In her passage fully assured be Vp-on þe se þat called was Egee, Þis false goddesse he[m] anoon forsoke; And Boreas, þe felle wynde, a-woke, And with his hidous dredful noise &amp; soun He turned al her quiete vp-so-doun, And made þe wowes grisly to arise. And, as þe story shortly doth deuyse, Þe bri?t[e] day was turned in-to ny?t, Þe heuene dirk, except þe dredful li?t Of þe leuene, whiche made hem sore agast; And þe þondre, þat seuerede seil &amp; mast, Her toppes smet in-to peces smale, And in-to water made hem lowe avale; And fir of li?tnynge sodeinly þere-wiþ, Þat Wolcanus forgeth on his stith, Hath bord fro bord with þe flawme rent, And two &amp; twenti of her shipes brent, Wiþ-oute eschape, platly, or refuge, Þoru? þe rage of þis fel deluge. For al to wrak þis woful navie goth, Whilom with Grekes Minerva was so wroth, For þei dide hir no reuerence; And specially for þe grete offence Þat spitfully Cylleus Aiax wrou?t, Whiche in þis tempest he ful dere abou?t: For whan [h]is shippes wer almost [y-]drowned, Þis goddesse haþ so on him frowned, And of vengaunce so felly hym awaked, Þat he was fayn for to swymme naked, As seith myn auctour, at meschef to þe lond. And þer he was fonden on þe sonde, Al-most at deth, with-oute remedie, To hym Minerva hath so gret envie; For he so woodly to hir temple went, And Cassandra to-fore hir auter hent By cruel force &amp; hatful violence. Lo, what pereil is to don offence Of hi?e dispit to any hooly place! I doute nat, he shal faile grace,— Who-so-euere vseth hit in dede, At þe last God wil quyte his mede [And] Rewarde hym lyk as he disserveth. And for swiche þing many Greke now sterveþ, Be-cause only of swiche occasioun,— Texemplefie, for no presumpcioun Folily tatame, as I haue tolde: For ageyn God who-so be to bolde Shal repent sonner þan he weneth; And many man þat noon harme [ne] meneth Suffreþ vengance for trespas of oon;— Þe first auctor goth not quite allone, But many oþer his offence abeith. For ceriously Guydo writ &amp; seith, Suynge in ordre þe woful auenture Þat euery Greke homward did endure, Of hi?e and lowe sparinge noon estat: How some welful &amp; some infortunat, Boþe of her wo &amp; [of] her welfare, Ri?t as it fil þe stori shal declare. How Kyng Naulus by treason was caused to sett vpon the Grekes nauye, &amp; draue þem vppon Rokkes. In Grece whilom was a worþi kyng, Manly &amp; riche, &amp; prudent of living, And had, in soth, lik as writ Guydo, In his tyme worþi sonys two: Pallamydes was þe eldest broþer, And Oetes called was þe toþer, Boþe tweyne of o moder borne. And as þe stori rehersed hath to-forne, Pallamydes was a noble kny?t, Ful famous eke of power &amp; of my?t, And fer spoke of in many sondri cost, And hadde also of al þe Grekis host For his wisdam whilom gouernaille; But he, allas! was slay[e]n in bataille, Þoru? vnhap of Martis cruel tene, Whanne þe sonne shon most bri?t &amp; shene Of his kny?thod &amp; his worþines, Lik as to-forn þe stori bereth witnes, And of his deth doth pleinly specefie. But now, of malys, hatrede, &amp; envie, Of swiche as haue tonges infortunat, To make [only] kyng Naulus at debat With þe Grekes, contrived was of newe An hi?e tresoun, fals &amp; ful vntrewe, Þe whiche, in soth, was neuer don ne wrou?t, Nor, in effect, ymagined nor þou?t, But a fals þing [y-]feyned of malis:— Þat þis kyng, so manly &amp; so wys, And so prudent, þis Pallamydes, Shuld of envie, God wot, causeles, At þe sege of Troye þe cite, Vp-on a ny?t falsly mordred be,— So þat þis slau?ter &amp; þis lothsom dede By Vlixes &amp; by Dyomede Wer fully wrou?t, as ?e han herd deuise, Whiche euery hert ou?t[e] to a-grise. Þis fals also, þat þis tale han feyned, To kyng Naulus han traitourly compleined —Al-be in dede it was neuere ment— Þat Grekis wern also of assent To þis mordre and conspiracioun, Boþe Menelay and Agamenoun— Al-be, in soth, þat euerydel was false! —Þat hanged be þei hi?e be þe halse, Þat can talis so forgen &amp; contrive, To make frendes causeles to strive!— For þei þoru? fraude of fals collusioun Kyng Naulus putte in suspecioun, Þat Grekis had conspired, dout[e]les, Vp-on þe mordre of Pallamydes, Making her ground, whiche þei dide feyne, Þat fro Troye wer sent lettris tweyne To Pallamydes, in-mediately direct, Whiche concluded tresoun in effect: How þat he was, for al his hi?e estat, Falsly allied and confederat To hem of Troye for a somme of gold, (Al þis þei han feyned and y-told) And how he had oute of þe cite Of gold resseyved huge quantite, To fyn only Grekes to be-traye, And to prolonge hem, platly, and delay At þe sege in getynge of þe toun, By his engyn and mediacioun. And to conferme al þis in sentence, To make Naulus ?eue ful credence, Þei seide pleinly, in conclusioun, Þe lettres which wer sent fro þe toun I-fonde wern enclosed in a sheld Vp-on a kny?t y-slawen in þe feld, Comprehendynge hool þe trecherie, Þe tresoun ful, and confederacie Atwene þe toun and Pallamydes,— Verraily, þou? he were gilt[e]les. And to ?euen more open euydence, To make a pref of þis grete offence, Þei seide Vlixes—affermynge in certeyn,— Accorded was with a chaumberleyn Þat was in offis with Pallamydes, Wondre secre &amp; no þing rekkeles, For to assent to þis conspiracie, Wrongly compassid of brennyng hot envie, Behotynge hym guerdoun &amp; gret mede, Like his devis texecute in dede: To take a tresour &amp; a somme of good, Ful secrely, &amp; knyt it in an hood, And hyden it, whan voided was þe pres, Vnder þe bedde of Pallamydes. And more to putte Grekis in surete, Þe tresour was þe same of quantite, —Þat it ne my?t after be denyed,— Liche as þe lettris had[de] specified. And whan al þis founde was &amp; knowe, Þoru?-oute þe hoste noised &amp; y-blowe, Boþe of þe lettris &amp; þe gold also, Fro point to point according boþe two, Whiche þat þis kyng, assentyng to tresoun, Receyved hadde oute of Troye toun, To be assentid (as ?e han herd me telle), Þe Grekes þo no lenger wold[e] dwelle, But shop hem forþe, alle of on entent, And in al haste cam in-to þe tent Of þis kyng, ful Innocent &amp; clene, Þat litel knewe what þei wolde mene, But vp-on hym, ful kny?tly as he stood, In her Ire furious and wood, To be vengid loude gan to crie— Þer may no man her malys modefie, Þei wern on hym so merciles at al. And, as I fynde, most in special, Kyng Menelay and Agamenoun, Only meved of indignacioun, Wolde haue proceded vn-to Iugement, Of hasty rancour with-oute auysement On þis tresoun avenged for to be, Nat-with-stondynge al his hi?e degre; But, in sothnes, whan þis worþi kyng Conceyued hath þis malis in werkyng, First astonid in his inward si?t, Al sodeynly stirt vp lik a kny?t, Þis wyse worþi, þis Pallamydes, Hardy as lyoun amyd al þe pres, No þing agast, him kny?tly gan excuse, And pleinly seide he wolde nat refuse Taquite hym silf of þis orrible cas, Nat excepting þat he so worþi was Of birþe &amp; blood &amp; of hi?e kynrede, Al þis devoidinge, of kny?thod &amp; manhede, As he þat gaf of lif nor deth no fors, To-forn hem alle to iuparte his cors With-Inne a feld, wher hem list ordeyne, Lyk as a kny?t his quarel to darreyne With who þat list or durst it vndirtake, Excepcioun hym liked noon to make Of hi?e nor lowe, who þat were so bolde To preue þe tresoun, þat I haue ?ow tolde, Besechinge hem to make no delay Nor prolonge hym, but þe same day Manly requeringe it may be don in hast. But þei þat had falsly þis þing compast, Of his answer astonyd wern echon In al þe host þat þer was nat oon Þat hardy was, ?if I shal nat feyne, In chaumclos þis quarel to darreyne— Nouþer Vlixes, nouþer Dyomede, Chef werkers of þis foule dede. But Vlixes, as he was customable, In euery þing to be deceyuable, Double in his werk &amp; ful ay of deceit, Liche a serpent þat lyth in a-wait, Whiche vnder floures can so glide &amp; trace,— Ri?t so Vlixes, with a feyned face, Whan þat he sawe þe kny?tly hi?e prowesse, Þe manly cher, and þe hardynesse And hi?e renoun of þis Pallamydes, Anoon of falshede put hym silf in pres, And liche a frende þat ment[e] nat but wel, Brotel as glas, pretendinge outward stel, With oon þe first gan [him] to excuse, Hem conseillinge no lenger for to muse On þis mater, for her alder ese, And by craft gan hem so appese, Touching þe rumour of þis hi?e tresoun, Þat he hath voided al suspecioun Oute of her hertis,—concludynge, in certeyn, Þis accusynge made was in veyn, And conspired only of hatrede— Al-be hym silf was rote of al þis dede. But whanne he saw he my?t[e] nat acheve, As ?e han herd, þis worþi kyng to greue, Som spot of tresoun on hym for to leye, He hath anon founde anoþer weye By thassent fully of Diomede: Vnder pretence, pleinly, of frendlyhede Comynge to hym ageyn a certeyn ny?t, Vnder surance, as he was trewe kny?t, Counseil to kepe, ouþer for sote or sour, Enformyng hym of a grete tresour Of gold &amp; good and infinit richesse To hem discured vnder secrenesse, Þe whiche, sothly, no man dide knowe, Hid &amp; enclosid in a welle lowe With-Inne a feld a litel þer be-side, Þe whiche hem list fro hym nat to hyde, But of trust vn-to hym discure, So he wolde done his besy cure Þe same ny?t with hem for to go Vn-to þe welle—þei þre &amp; no mo— To fet a-way þat grete some of good. And he, in soth, þat no þing vndirstood What þei ment, assentid was anoon; And so þei þre be to-gidre goon Vn-to þe welle, lik as I haue told, And for þat he most manly was &amp; bold, Pallamydes, liche as þei hym telle, Descended is lowe in-to þe welle, Supposinge to haue a tresour founde. But þei, allas! hym falsly to confounde, Han mordrid hym with stonys gret &amp; huge, He in þe botme havynge no refuge; And whan þei had acomplished þer entent, Þei be repeired eueryche to his tent. Þis þe tale, þe stori telleth vs, Þat feyned was to þe kyng Naulus, Tochinge þe deth of Pallamydes, Hem to disclaundre þat were gilt[e]les! For Vlixes, &amp; with hym Diomede Were Innocent, platly, as I rede, And Grekis alle, boþe ny?e &amp; ferre: For he was slayn kny?tly in þe werre, Duringe þe sege, of Paris with an arwe. But who is fals, feyne can ful narwe To fynde a tale þat neuere ?it was þou?t! And of þe tresoun þat shuld haue be wrou?t Touchynge þe lettris sent oute of þe toun, Þer was no swiche conspiracioun By Grekis wrou?t, but a fable vnsoth, Falsly feyned to make Naulus wroth With Vlixes and Diomede also, Agamenoun, and oþer Grekis mo, To letten hem homward in her weye, And hyndre also—þer is no more to seie— As þei repeire to her regiouns. And Naulus þanne by þis occasiouns, And Oetes his sone, a manly man, Accorded ben, in what þei may or can, Be oon assent tavenge merciles Þe cruel mordre of Pallamydes, And to ordeyne at her hom passage To werke fully in-to her damage, For Grekes moste of necessite Homward saille for-by his contre. Wherfore þis kyng shapen hath a wyle: On hilles hi?e, by a lytel yle, In wynter sesoun euery maner ny?t To make fires and to sette vp ly?t, To causen hem on þe se to erre. For, as Grekis sawe þe fire a-ferre, Vnwar of harme, cast hem for to londe, As þei þat coude no pereil vndirstonde, But shopen hem with al her ful[le] my?t For to arive fast[e] by þe li?t, Wher-with two hundrid of her shippes brak Amonge rokkes, and fully go to wrak, Þat þer was drowned many worþi man. And þus þe vengaunce alderfirst be-gan Þat kyng Naulus hath on Grekis take Of dedly hate for his sonis sake, To gret mischef and confusioun Of Grekis navie; but Agamenoun With gret pereil is þe deth eskaped, Þat had almost among hem be beiapid: For erlys, dukis, &amp; worþi kynges crowned, Þoru? þis treyne in þe se wer drowned. But Menelay and also Diomede Eskapeden þis meschef, as I rede. And when þei wern from al daunger goon, Þis Oetes, wood for Ire, anoon In his herte shope anoþer wyle, And þou?t he wold Agamenoun be-gyle, Compassinge a ful mortal strif, Leet send a lettre anon to þe wyf Of þis my?ti grete Agamenoun, In whiche þer was included fals tresoun; For evene lik, ?if I shal nat lye, Þus in effect þei dide specefie: First, how hir lord Agamenoun þe kyng Hadde at þe sege wrou?t a wonder þing In preiudyse and sclaunder of hir name, Al-be in hir was no maner blame, (Liche as he wrot) platly, nor trespace His kyngly honour of foly to difface;— Þis to seyn, Guydo telleth þus, He loued a dou?ter of kyng Priamus, And for bewte had hir to wyve take, And hir in herte finally for-sake, Þis worþi quene, whilom of so gret fame;— And Clemestra sothly was hir name, Wonder semly and ri?t fair with-al, And be descent borne of þe stook royal,— Hir tellynge eke, for al hir excellence, Al-be þat she neuere dide offence,— ?et hir lord of newfangilnesse Toke anoþer, þe lettres dide expresse, Fully in purpos anoon at his repeire, Þou? Clemestra wer boþe good &amp; fayre, Al sodeynly hir[e] to exile Oute of his lond many þousand myle, Warnyng hir þat she be prudent. Þis was þe substaunce, as in sentament, Þat Oetes wrote vn-to þis quene, Al-be þe kyng was Innocent &amp; clene, And was to hir in al his forn lyvynge Lovynge and trewe in al maner þing, And hir to plese passinge ententif In word and dede duryng al his lyf, As fer as ou?t of resoun be desyred. But þe letteris, þat falsly were conspired, Þei han hir put, par cas of Innocence, For to ?even to hastily credence, Þankynge first Oetes for his trouþe, Þat so goodly hym list to haue rouþe Vp-on hir wronge of hi?e compassioun. (And ?et þe story makeþ mencioun Here-afterward, as I shal descrive, Þat she was þe falsest oon alyve Vn-to hir lord in his longe absence.) And in al hast she made strong diffence Ageyn þis kyng, &amp; gan hir to purueie Be swiche fraude þat she shal nat deie; But of hir werk, in soth, she was to wyte, Þe whiche, allas! I must anoon endite, As þe story, platly, doth me lere, Whiche doolful is &amp; mortal for to here! How kynge Agamenon, by treason of Oetes aforesaide, by his owne quene Clemestra was slayne in his bedde; and how she maried Egistus. Ovnsur trust of al worldly glorie, With sodeyn chaunge put oute of memorie! O Ioie vnstable of veyn ambicioun, With vnwar torn reuersed vp-so-doun! O ydel fame, blowe up to þe skye, Ouer-whelmyd with twyncling of an eye! O pompe, o bost of tryumphe &amp; victorie, Liche a shadewe wast &amp; transitorie! O Fortune, fals and vnassured, Þat [to] no man was neuer fully lured, To hi?e nor lowe of no maner estat, With bond of feith to be confederat; Ageyn whos my?t no man may him diffende, But at his torne þat he shal descende Whan he sit hi?est on þin vnstable whele,— Þi brotel fauour, forgid not of stele, Meynt and allaied with mutabilite: For welfulnesse and fals felicite With sodeyn swi? froward þou canst avale! Now freshe of chere, now for anger pale, Of hi?e disdeyn þou sparest no degre; For princes, dukes, hi?est in her se, Mi?ti kynges &amp; worþi Emperours Þat richest regne in her royal floures, With sceptre &amp; crowne þou canst pulle doun! I take witnesse of Agamenoun, Þat was so noble &amp; my?ti in his lyve, As sondry auctours his hi?e renoun discrive; But, sothfastly, for al his excellence, He my?t[e] nat make no diffence, With alle þe kynges þat his baner swe, Conspired mordre to voiden &amp; eschewe. Reskus was noon þat he koude make! For whiche, allas! my penne I fele quake, Þat doth myn ynke blotten on my boke. O my?ti God, þat with þin inward loke Sest euery þing þoru? þin eternal my?t, Whi wiltow nat of equite and ri?t Punishe &amp; chastise so horrible a þing, And specialy þe mordre of a kyng? Allas! þe peyne of Yxyoun in helle, Or of Manes þat with Sathan dwelle, Were nat egal nor equipolent To venge mordre, nor sufficient: For it excedeth in comparisoun Al felonye, falshede, and tresoun. Wherfor, o Lord, þat sest &amp; knowest al Þoru? þi power þat is eternal, Suffre non swiche to live vp-on þe grounde— Wers þan tigre or Cerberus þe hounde, Þat cheyned lyth, bounde at helle gate; Whiche, of malis pleinly þou? he hate, He berkeþ first or he do offence: But mordre gladly is wrou?t in silence Or men aduerte or taken any kepe. Allas! a prince to slen hym in his slepe, On his pilwe whanne he slepeth softe, Þat crieth wreche to hi?e God alofte And axeþ vengaunce to be take as faste: Þou? it abide it wil oute at þe laste! Allas! a kyng, spoken of so ferre, Þat was so worþi outeward in þe werre! His cruel fate, passinge odious, Disposed hath in his owne hous His mortal ende to ben execute, Ageyn[e]s whiche þer was no refute. For ri?t as he his ship to lond[e] sette, Þe quene Clemestra on þe strond [him] met With humble chere &amp; loke ful benigne, And shewed oute many feithful signe Of wifly trouþe in hir countenaunce, Al-be in herte þer was variaunce, Nat parceived pleinly in her face. Whom þe kyng goodly dide embrace, As he in soth þat but trouþe ment; And to his paleis þe hi?e weie he went, Nat aduerting þe tresoun þat was shape, Þe whiche, allas! he my?t[e] nat eskape— Of þe falshede he koude no þing fele. But I ne may no lenger it concele, Ageyn hir lord how Clemestra wrou?t; For on hir bond of wedlok she ne þou?t; Þe trewe lok, sothly, of spousaille Ageyn hir malis lite my?t availle Vn-to hir lord hir trouþe to conserue. Newfangilnesse causede to sterve Hir olde feith and hir assuraunce. Hir loue abood on a fikel chaunce; Longe absence had hir hert appalled. She loued oon þat was Egistus called, Whiche a-forn alle in hir grace stood, Þat nouþer was of birþe nor of blood Litel or nou?t of reputacioun, Nor renomed of manhod nor renoun, Nor of kny?thod nor of hi?e prowesse, But for his labour &amp; his besynesse And good await [vp-]on hir be ny?t. Þerfor he was best forþered in hir si?t, Suche drede hadde she for to lyn allone, Sorweles so wel she koude grone. I can nat seyn what lif þat þei ladde, Except þat she by hym a dou?ter hadde; And Erigona Guydo seith she hy?t. And vn-to hym Clemestra behi?t, Assurynge hym vp peyne of hir hed, He sholde regne whan hir lorde wer ded; And to enhaste þis conclusioun, Hir worþi lord, kyng Agamenoun, Þe next[e] ny?t was mordred &amp; I-slayn By fals Egistus: &amp; þe quene ful fayn No lenger bood, þe story can ?ou lere, But in al hast þei wedded wern I-fere. And by hir false &amp; slei?ti compassyng Of Messene she made hym crowned kyng, And putte hym ful in possessioun. Allas! þat synne hath domynacioun To forþer wronge and abate ri?t! For in þis worlde falshed hath more my?t Ful ofte sithe þan haþ ri?twisnesse, And in þestat set of worþinesse. Lo, how þe synne of avouterye Brou?t in mordre by conspiracie! Synne vp-on synne lynked boþe tweyne, And, enbracid in þe fendis cheyne, Perpetuelly in helle to endure! Allas! who shal hym silfe ful assure Fro cruel mordre his body to withdrawe, Whan þat kynges in her bed are slawe?— Whiche bringeth in alyenacioun, By extort title fals successioun;— Þer may colour of pretense seme, But ful streitly God shal after deme And iustly venge with due recompense Intrusioun brou?t in by violence, And felly quite swiche horrible þinges As sodeyn slau?ter, specially of kynges, Gretly to drede in euery regioun. And, as I finde, þat Agamenoun By Clemestra, þe false double quene, Hadde a sone passing fair to sene, Ri?t gracious in euery mannys si?t; And Horestes þe bok seith þat he hi?t, Wonder semly &amp; but ?ong of age. And for gret fer in þis mortal rage List he wer slayn, as it was to drede, Tanulle his title þat he nat succede, Hym to preserue þat he wer nat shent, Kyng Taltibus with power haþ hym sent Ful secrely oute of þat cuntre Vn-to a kyng called Ydumee, Þat held his sceptre &amp; his royal sete Ful my?tely in þe lond of Crete. And Carkasis named was þe quene, Þat hadde a dou?ter called [eke] Clymene, Born to ben eir of þat regioun. And, as it is made eke mencioun, Þis Horestes, to reknen al[le] þing, Was with þe quene and also with þe kyng Cherisshed as wel, þe story can ?ou lere, As Clymena hir owne dou?ter dere, And was eke kept and hadde in cherte Fro point to point, liche to his degre, With attendaunce convenient &amp; due To his estat, þat euere vp-on hym sue, Of swiche as wern most expert &amp; sage To gouerne hym til he com to age, To reioishe, ?if God ?af hym my?t, His heritage to whiche he hadde ri?t By clere discent, ?if happi were his chaunce. Þus leue I hym vnder gouernaunce, Þe ?onge sone of Agamenoun. For I mvt make a digressioun Fro þis mater, and telle of Diomede Þe auentures, in Guydo as I rede,— His woful fate &amp; his peynes smerte, Þe whiche, allas! he my?t[e] nat asterte, As is remembrid pleinly in writing, Þat Oetes, sone of þe riche kyng Called Naulus, as ?e han herd to-forn, Swiche hevines in his herte haþt born Vn-to Grekis repeiring home fro Troye, Þat his lust &amp; his inwarde Ioie Was hem to hindre, boþe hi?e &amp; lowe; And cause whi to ?ou is nat vnknowe: To hem he was so passing envious, In wil and þou?t yliche desirous ?if he my?t, sothly þis no lees, Þe deth tavenge of Pallamydes, Liche as to-forn þe story can deuise To ?ou þat ben so prudent &amp; so wyse. And how Oetes now of malis wrou?t, And traitourly newe menys sou?t ?if he my?t be any maner weye Diomedes vnwarly distroye,— Of al þis þing I cast[e] nat to faile Ceriously to make rehersaille. How quene Egra, the wyff of Dyomede, exilede hym when he wolde have reparyde to his owne kyngdam fro Troye, by the fals ymaginacyoun of Oetes, Palamydes brothere. In Grece was a kyngdam wyde &amp; large, Coniunct in oon, Calydonye &amp; Arge, Ful abundaunt of riches and of rent, Of whiche þe kyng called was Pollent, A worþi man &amp; of a noble fame, And had a son—Assandrus was his name— And a dou?ter passing fair of si?te, And, sothly, Egra I fynde þat she hi?te. And for hir fader, lik as writ Guydo, Had no mo but þese children two, For hem he haþ of wisdam so prouyded, Þis my?ti regne for to be deuided Atwene hem two after his disses, Eche with his part for to liven in pes, Texcluden hem fro indigence or nede. And she was wyf vn-to Diomede,— Al-be to-forn þe story of hym saide Þat he whilom loued wel Cressaide— I can nat seine wher it was doubilnesse, But wel wot I, Guydo bereth witnesse And in his book, sothly, seith non oþer,— And how Assandrus, his owne wyves broþer, Ful lusti, fresshe, &amp; ful of manlihede To Troie went wiþ þis Diomede; But in þe se for-driven vp-so-doun, Þei ryved vp in þe regioun Called Boece, al discounsolat, With tempest drive, wery &amp; ful maat, Hem to refresshe &amp; for non oþer þing; In whiche lond Thelephus was kyng. Of whos rivaille whan he herd[e] seyn, In his herte he hadde hi?e disdeyn Þat þei wer bold to don so gret offence, Tentre his grounde havinge no licence; And ?it, in soth, þei dide no damage To hi?e nor lowe of no maner age, Nor toke nat þat my?t disavaille Vn-to þat lond, but it were vitaille, For whiche þei paied iustly at þe fyn, For flesshe &amp; fysshe &amp; for bred &amp; wyn. ?it for al þat, of indignacioun Kyng Thelephus is descended doun With gret array, to harme hem ?if he my?t; And so þei gan to bikeren &amp; to fi?t. And Assandrus, ful of hi?e prowesse, Liche a lioun his fomen gan oppresse, And wonder kny?tly þe feld vp-on hem wan, And slow þat day many worþi man, Of hi?e corage and of manly pride. And whan þe kyng, whiche þat stod a-side, Sawe his men slawe on euery part, Of hi?e disdeyn hent anon a dart And cast at hym, allas, þe mortal fate! And percid hath þoru? mailles &amp; plate Of Assandrus, þat he fil doun ded, Þe soil aboute of his blood al red, His dedly wounde so be-gan to blede. And wod as tigre þo cam Diomede, And hym to avenge bar hym lik a kny?t, Sleþ and kylleþ, &amp; putte hem to þe fli?t, And after þat swiche sorwe gan to make Of kny?tly rouþe for his broþer sake, Þat he ne wist what was best to do. But, as I fynde, myd of al his wo, Fro best &amp; foule þe dede cors to save, Liche his estat he lete make a graue And buried hym after rytes olde. But Oetes to his sister tolde Þat he was slayn by fraude of Diomede, To fyn þat he my?t[e] [ful] possede Þe regne of Arge hool, with-oute strif, With þe purpa[r]ti annexid to his wif; For by his deth he my?t[e] sesoun take: And told [hir] eke þat she was for-sake, Þis faire Egra, for al hir wommanhede, Of hir lord called Diomede. All þis he told (in helle be he cheyned!). And, ouermore, he forged haþ &amp; feyned How of envie Assandrus lost his lyf; And how hir lord haþ take a-noþer wif, Þat was to hir dishonour &amp; shame, And passingly gret sclaunder to hir name In preiudise doon to hir estat. Al þis he tolde to make hem at debate, Liche as he wrot, in conclusioun, To Clemestra of Agamenoun, Whiche hir herte made sore greve: For he putte hir fully in byleve Of al þe tresoun, ?e haue herde me told, Þat for Ire she wexe pale and cold, Vnkyndenesse so hir herte sleth, And hevinesse of hir broþer deth. For neuer ?it, Guydo doth assure, No womman louede bet a creature Þan she louede hym, in no manere age: [For] First at nou?t she sette hir heritage In comparisoun of hir broþer lyf— Lo, how Oetes made a newe strif, As ?e han herde in þe story rede!— Þat gilt[e]les worþi Diomede, Whan he haþ long at þe sege leyn, And to his kyngdam wolde han comme ageyn, By my?ti hond of þis worþi quene, And hir liges þat assented bene, He was exiled oute of þat regioun,— Þer may be made no mediacioun. Þus, in hym silfe maat &amp; dis[es]peired, Discounsolat he is ageyn repeired To Salerne, a lond of gret richesse, Wher þat Teuter þoru? his worþinesse With crowne and scepter had[de] regned longe With his liges and his kny?tes stronge, And broþer was to Aiax Thelamoun, Mordred to-forn, as made is mencioun. And Diomede, pore and destitut, May in Salerne fynde no refut: For whan Teuter first gan hym espie, He suede after by ful gret envie, Havynge to hym ay suspecioun Touching þe deth of kyng Thelamoun. But Diomede on a certeyn ny?t Ful secrely hath taken hym to fli?t, And fro Salerne fast[e] gan hym hi?e In hope to fynde better remedie, Helpe or socour in som oþer place, ?if fortune wolde graunt hym grace. For of hym silf ashamed &amp; confus, As man forsake, abiect, and refus, Ri?t so ferde he, wandring to &amp; fro, As he þat nist what was best to do. But, I fynde, þe Troyan Eneas, Þat al þis while stille at Troye was, Only of rouþe and compassioun To supporte hem þat wer left of þe toun, Beynge alweye of her lyf in doute, Of her fomen rounde be-set aboute, As þei þat lyvede for lak of an hed Continuelly in meschef and in dred, Knowynge no refut nor counfort in þis cas,— Til by counseil of þis Eneas, To support hem in þis gret[e] nede Þei sent in haste for þis Diomede, Knowynge ful wel his desolacioun, How he was proscript fro his regioun— Besechinge hym, of manhod &amp; of rouþe, Hym to enhaste, with-outen any slouþe, With al þe stuf þat he gete can, And sowden vp euery manly man With-oute abood &amp; to Troie hem lede, To socour hem in þis grete nede. And Diomede cam, &amp; tarieth nou?t, At her request, as he was be-sou?t, To releue hem in þis sharp[e] shour, And with hym brou?t many soudiour. And Eneas on þe weie hym mette In frendely wyse, &amp; in-to toun hym fette, And to hym made passingly gret chere. And þer þei gan to comwne y-fere Her auentures boþe on lond and se, Entermedlyd wiþ gret aduersite, Þat no man may deuoide nor eschewe, But take his part, as it to hym is dwe, As sort or hap doth his bridel lede. And in þis story shortly to procede, Cely Troiens, þat almost were shent With her fomen of Iles adiacent Þat hem be-set abouten enviroun,— [But] Þoru? þe manhod and þe hi?e renoun Of Diomede and his sowdiours And oþer kny?tes, noble werriours, Þei wer reskued &amp; holpen outterly; And foure daies þei fau?t by and by, In kny?tly wyse deffendinge þe cite; And þoru? þe prowesse also of Enee Þei slen and take al þat hem with-stood, And in diffense of Troianyshe blood, Swiche as þei founde to þe cite fals, Þei henge hem vp hi?e by þe hals, And punyshe[d] hem for her gret[e] wrong. And Diomede þus gan wexe stronge By longe processe, as made is mencioun, Chef protector now of Troie toun, Þat enmy noon by a large space Durst abide, but he hadde grace, To his ligaunce so he made hem loute. And þus his name sprede gan aboute, Þat of his fame þe gret oppinioun Dilated is vn-to þe Regioun, By swift report, of Calydonye &amp; Arge, Whiche þe quene gretly gan to charge; And astonyd, whan she takeþ hede, His power gan &amp; his my?t to drede, List he wolde hir lond vp-on hir wynne, And of kny?thod a werre newe be-gynne. And secrely gan mvsen on þis þing, Þat hir lord &amp; hir my?ti kyng, Late exiled &amp; [y-]putte to fli?t, Hath grace founde in Fortunys si?t, And is remounted to so hi?e estat. Wherof she was in hir self chek-maat, And weyes cast, as she þat was prudent, By hool avis of hir parlement, With-oute grucchinge or rebellioun, Hym to reuoke to his Regioun; And þer-vppon to hym louly sent. And with lettres þe messager forþe went, Þe cause anullynge for whiche he was exiled, And how he was fully reconsiled By hool assent of his liges alle, And ful louly, euerychon, þei calle, For her offence &amp; [for] her trespace, With-oute rigour for to don hem grace. And he anoon, liche a manly kny?t, Mor of mercy, sothly, þanne of ri?t, Whan he hath her sond[e] wel conceived And her menynge fully apparceived, To stint al strif þou?t[e] for þe beste In goodly wyse to graunte her requeste; And to his regne with-Inne a certeyn day He is repeired in ful riche array. Of whos commyng ful glad his liges ben; And recouncyled boþe he &amp; quene, And al rancour of any old offence Only of wysdam þei put in suspence; And of oon hert a blisful lyf þei lede— In Troie boke no more of him I rede, But late him lyve in felicite! Ageyn resortynge to tellen of Enee, After how he hath his tyme spent, Whiche is fro Troie with many Troyan went. His shippes stuffed, he &amp; his meyne Be seiled forþe by many straunge se, Many daunger &amp; many streit passage, To-forn or he arived in Cartage, Ledyng wiþ hym his fader Anchises,— Þat, be þe waye, I fynde þat he les His wyf Crewsa by fatal auenture;— But al þe wo þat he dide endure, Who-so list ceriously to sene,— And how þat he falsede þe quene, I mene Dido, of wommanhede flour, Þat gaf to hym [hir] richesse &amp; tresour, Iowelys &amp; gold, &amp; al þat my?t hym plese, And euery þing þat my?t[e] do hym ese, But for al þat, how he was vnkynde,— Rede Eneydos, &amp; þer ?e shal it fynde:— And how þat he falsly stale away By ny?ter tyme while she a-bedde lay, And of his conquest also in Yta[i]lle, Where he had many stronge bataille, His auentures and his werkes alle, And of þe fyn þat is to hym falle,— ?e may al seen, by ful souereyn style From point to point compiled in Virgile, Written &amp; made siþen go ful ?ore; For Troie boke spekeþ of hym no more, But procedeth, as I shal endite, How Horrestes cast hym for to quyte His fadres deth, pleinly, &amp; nat spare, ?if ?e list here as Guydo shal declare. Howe Horrestes was commawnded by the goddis, that he shulde repayre to his kyngdam, and Cruelly, without pite, scle his moder Clemestra, for the mordere of his Fader, Agamenoun. It is requerid of equite &amp; ri?t, Of þilke Iuge þat is most of my?t And egally holdeth his balaunce, On deth conspired for to do vengaunce: Þe vois of blood doth so ay contune To crye wreche with clamoure importune On hem, in soth, þat it iniustly shede; For mordre wrou?t wil han his egal mede And his guerdoun, as he hath disservid. Þei may nat fle þe Iugement reservid Of hym þat sitte hi?est in his throne, And al beholdeth by hym silf allone, Ful ri?tfully, þe noble my?ti Kyng; For þou? he suffre, he for?et no þing, But al considereth in his inspeccioun. And for þe mordre of Agamenoun, Þe my?ti Lord, whiche is most souereyn God, Made his mynystre of þe same blood, ?onge Horrestes, ful of hi?e prowesse, Texecute his dome of ri?twisnesse, And gaf to hym power, grace, &amp; my?t. And he anoon toke þe ordre of kny?t Of Ydumeus, liche as it is tolde, Whan he was foure &amp; twenti wynter olde, Fresshe and lusty, &amp; wonderly prudent, And inwardly desirous of entent, ?if fortune wolde hym nat wyth-seyn, His heritage to recure ageyn Whiche Egistus falsly hym denyeth, And þe crowne iniustly occupieth By fals title of hir þat was his wyf. But Horrestes wil iupart his lif, And aventure, while him lasteth breth: First to be venged on his fadris deth Vp-on hem þo þat þe tresoun wrou?t. And alderfirst ful louly he be-sou?t Kyng Ydumee of his goodlyhede To forþeren hym in þis gret[e] nede; And þe kyng benignely anoon Assigned hath with hym for to goon A þousand kny?tes, manly &amp; ri?t stronge, To redresse þe grete horrible wronge Of Egistus wrou?t by violence. And by his wysdam &amp; his dilligence, Þis Horrestes gan hym so purueie, With-Inne a while, þer is no more to seie, Þat he hym gat (þe story wil nat lye) A-noþer þousand in his companye Of worþi kny?tes, alle of oon accorde To go with hym, as with her souereyn lord, In euery þing his biddyng to obeie, As ?e han herde, Egistus to werreye. And þus Horrestes, in ful riche array, Gan hosteye &amp; made no delay, And his loggynge aldirfirst gan chese In a cite þat called was Troe?e, Received þere with grete reuerence Of þe kyng, þat named was Forence, A manly kny?t, as bokes specefie, And bare in herte passing gret envie To Egistus, by double occasioun: First, for þe deth of Agamenoun, And eke for he hadde a dou?ter dere Þat was to hym inwardly entere, Boþe good &amp; fair, &amp; but ?onge of age, Þat whilom was ?oven in mariage To Egistus; but he of doubilnesse, Of fals tresoun &amp; newfongilnesse Þe kynges dou?ter haþ outterly for-sake, And in al haste dide a lybel make, And forge a writ of repulsioun, Al-be he hadde no trewe occasioun, Þis Egistus, þat he hir for-soke, Saue þat he falsly to wyve toke Þe quene Clemestra, a-geyn al [ri?t and] lawe, Whanne by assent þei mordred han &amp; slawe Agamenoun, as it to-forn is tolde, Þat whilom was so my?ti &amp; so boold. And for þe hatful fals conspiracie, As wel of mordre as [of] avoutrie, To venge boþe by due recompense, Þe worþi kny?t, þe my?ti kyng Forrense Offred Horestes for to make hym stronge And go with hym to helpe venge his wrong, And with hym ladde, armed bri?t in steel, Foure hundrid kny?tes, horsed wonder wel, Takynge þe feld with a manly chere. And so Horestes and þe kyng y-fere Be riden forþe with many manly man. But Horestes, or [he] þis werre gan, Whan bri?t[e] Phebus in þe Bole shoon, To þe temple is ful lowly goon, And to þe goddis in his best[e] wyse With humble herte dide sacrifise, Fully in hope þe better for to fare: Wher he was bode, for lif nor deth to spare, With-oute merci or remissioun, Þe deth to venge of Agamenoun On Clemestra, þat was most to wyte, And þat he make first his swerd to bite On his moder, with his hondis tweyne, And ouermore to done his besy peyne, With-oute pite, &amp; no merci shewe, On smale pecis til she be to-hewe And dismembrid assondre Ioint fro Ioint, And eke þat he for?ete nau?t a point, Iustly to punyshe by rigour &amp; by ri?t Egistus eke, þe fals vntrewe kny?t, And þat he be nat slowe nor necligent To execute þe commaundement Of þe goddes, list what after falle. And þanne Horestes with his kny?tes alle, And Forense þe my?ti kyng also, Of oon herte be to þe sege go Of þe cite þat called was Methene, With-Inne whiche was þe fals[e] quene Clemestra,—God ?if hir harde grace! And whanne Horestes seged haþ þe place, With his kny?tes set it rounde aboute, False Egistus was y-riden oute To gadre men and to ben awreke, And falle vppon &amp; þe sege breke ?if he my?t, on eny maner side; And with gret stuf þus he gan to ride, Takyng vp men fro euery cost, Til he hym made a ful my?ti host. But Horestes, whiche at þe sege lay, His gouernaunce espieth day be day, And sent oute men, as he þat was ful sage, To stoppe weies &amp; lettyn his passage, And made kny?tes, a ful huge route, To pursewe hym euery cost aboute. And of þe sege, manfully be-gonne, By assaute he hath þe toun y-wonne, And entrid in on a ny?t ful late, And set[te] wardis stronge at euery gate. And in [a] dongoun, moste stronge &amp; principal, Þat was of bildynge my?ti and royal, Þis Horestes first his moder fond, Þe quene Clemestra, lady of þat lond, Whiche for drede sore gan to quake; But merciles anoon he made hir take And putte in cheynes til þe next[e] morwe. And Egistus,—God ?if hym euele sorwe!— With al þe stuf þat he my?t acroche, Toward þe toun fast[e] gan a-proche In purpos ful Horestes for to greve, And hem with-Inne sodeynly releve. But al, in soth, my?t[e] nat availle; For or þat he þe cite my?t availle, Horestes kny?tes vnwarly han hym met, And alle attonis proudly on hym set: First slayn his men &amp; putte hem to þe fli?t, And taken hym, maugre al his my?t, And with cheynes, lik as þei hym finde, Merciles ful fast[e] þei hym binde, And shet hym vp, fetrid in prisoun. And alle fals founden in þe toun, Þat wer assentid, willy, or helpynge To þe mordre of þe worþi kyng, Grete werkers and conspiratours, Ageyn her lord rysing as traitours,— Alle were take and bounde be rigour Þe same ny?t, &amp; shet vp in a tour, Til on þe morwe, lik as þe lot be drawe, Eueryche of hem vndirfonge his lawe Liche his decert,—excepcioun was noon. And whanne þe ny?t passed was &amp; goon, And Phebus ros estwarde in his spere And on þe toures shon ful bri?t &amp; clere, Whanne Clemestra, rote of al falshede, Was brou?t forþe, quakyng in her drede, Beforn Horestes to Iugement I-fet, He, with a swerde, sharpe and kene whet, Liche as þe goddes chargid hym to-forn, On pecis smale he hath hir al to-shorn, And made hir bern oute of þe tovnis boundis To be vowrid of bestis &amp; of houndis:— Pite was noon in his brest reseruyd, But quitte hir fully as she haþ disservid Fro point to point, &amp; forgat ri?t nou?t. And þanne cheyned Egistus was forþe brou?t, And iustly dempt by rigour of þe lawe On an hirdel naked to be drawe Þoru?-oute þe toun, þat alle my?t[e] se, And after hi?e [en]hangid on a tre, For to rote &amp; drye ageyn þe sonne. Lo, how mordre haþ his guerdoun wonne! Lo, how falshede his maister can awake! And alle þe traitours in þe toun y-take Wern on galwes enhonged euerychon, Til þei were seuered asonder bon fro bon, Hi?e on an hil ageyn þe sterres shene. Þus was þe toun fro tresoun purged clene, And with trouþe awmentid &amp; y-morid; And to his regne Horestes ful restorid, As þe story suynge shal expowne, And of þe day whan he toke his crowne. Howe kynge Menelay, brother to Agamenon, set a parlement at Athenes, wher he entendyde to haue deprivede Horrestes of his kyngdam, for þe dethe of his moder; bot Horrestes was crownyde. And whan þe myst &amp; euery cloudy skye Of fals tresoun and conspiracie Were tried oute, vp-on euery side, Þat falshed had no place to abide, Þe story seith, in ordre rehersynge, Þe same tyme Menelay þe kyng, Oute of þe se ful of wawys wete, Fro Troie-ward arived was in Crete, Frely eskapid many drede and peyne, With his quene, þe goodly freshe Eleyne. And for cause she was so famous fair, Gret was þe pres &amp; merveilous repaire Fro euery part hir bewte to beholde, For whom Troie, with wallis not ful olde, Destroied was, þe noble royal toun; And many man, ful worþi of renoun, Haþ lost his lyf—þer may no man seie nay— Al for Eleyne, wyf to Menelay: Whan þing is doon, it may be noon oþer. But whan þis kyng knewe fully of his broþer Agamenoun mordre and euerydel, He was ful trist, &amp; liked no þing wel, But inwardly felt[e] ful grete smerte; And his nevew he hadde also at herte— I mene Horestes—þat so merciles, Liche a tyraunte þat were graceles, His moder slowe, and had[de] no pite, Of mortal Ire in his cruelte,— And fully cast þat he wolde blive Of scepter &amp; crowne, platly, hym deprive, Fully affermynge, for þis hatful cas By al lawe þat he vnworþi was His fadris regne as eyr to possede, Iustly considrid his horrible dede. And al attonis, furious and wroth, With-oute abood vn-to ship he goth, Malencolyk in his grete tene, Oute of Crete seiling to Athene, And toke þe lond oute of shipes bord Where duke Nestor was gouernour &amp; lord, Whiche hym receiveth, like a gentil kny?t, With al his power, dilligence, and my?t. But Menelay, of rancour and gret hete Gan with þe duke secrely to trete To fynde a mene in his inwarde si?t For to deprive Horestes of his ri?t. And þer-vp-on to haue a iugement, At Athenes was holde a parlement Of þe lordis of þat regioun, To ?eve þer-on a diffinicioun, In whiche was shewed, openly y-nowe, How Horestes his owne modir slowe, And þe maner of his grete offence, Hym silf[e] þo beyng in presence. And whan þis þing he fully dide espie, For his party he gan ageyn replie, As he þat felte hym frely at his large, For hym alleggynge þat he had in charge Of þe goddis, shortly to declare, His mortal swerde þat he nat ne spare Vp-on Clemestra, rote of false tresoun, Þat slowe hir lord, kyng Agamenoun, And þe mordre þoru? hir malis wrou?t. Wherfore Horestes humblely besou?t Þe lordes alle, with a manly herte, Of equite considren and aduerte, For no malis, rancour, nor for rage Hym to deprive of his heritage, Siþen he was sone of Agamenoun, Borne to ben eyr of þe Regioun, As ?e han herd, þat called was Methene, Al-be his moder, Clemestra þe quene, Compassid had his destructioun. But duke Nestor, ymeved of resoun, In sustenyng of Horestes ri?t, Roos vp anoon lyk a manly kny?t, Offringe him silf proudly for his sake Þis hi?e quarel for to vndirtake, With his body to þe deth darreyne Wiþ whom þat list his title to with-seyne. But þer was noon in al þat companye Þat durste a word a-geyn[e]s him replye, So hool he stood in his oppinioun. And by his kny?tly mediacioun He bar hym so, feynyng in no þing, Þat Horestes was [y-]crowned kyng Of Methene, alle beyng of assent. And whan dissoluyd was þe parlement, Þis Horestes of his liges trewe Resseyved was with a crowne newe, And by trete of lordis many oon Kyng Menelay &amp; he wer made at oon, And gan her Ire &amp; her rancour lete. And Ydumee, þe my?ty kyng of Crete, So prudently gouerneth þis matere, Þat Hermyone, þe ?ong[e] dou?ter dere Of Menelay and þe quene Eleyne, So ?ong, so freshe, of bewte souereyn, I-wedded was with-oute more tariyng To Horestes, þe newe lusty kyng. And by cause of þis allyaunce Devoided was al rancour and distaunce Atwene þe kynges, Menelay þe olde And Horestes, of whom ri?t now I tolde. Þus leue I hem, as it was þe beste, Eche in his regne lyve in pes &amp; reste; For al strif was cessid in þis cas. But Erygona, þat þe dou?ter was Of Egistus, as ?e han herd me telle, For sorwe &amp; drede list no lenger dwelle, But toke a rope, &amp; liste no þing to spare, And þer-with-al gan hir silf to gnare, Þe story seith, hi?e vp-on a tre: Þis was hir fyn,—?e gete no more of me— But I wil forþe ceriously entrete Of þe story to tellen ?ow þe grete. The wonderfule eskaipis of Vlixes aftire þat he departede fro Troy; and howe he made a soroweful compleynte against fortune to the worshipful kynge, called Ydumye. O Vlixes, by ordre in my writyng, Þin aventures commen on þe ring, Ful wonderful boþe on lond and se, Entermedlid with grete aduersite! For Guydo, first discrivinge þi repeire, Seith how þou founde weder foule &amp; faire, Now agreable, now þe thounder sowne, Now stille and smothe, now with clowdis frowne, And seith also, þat þou dedist ordeyne To þi passage my?ty shippes tweyne, Apparailled al for marchaundise, Þat þou my?test in most secre wyse Euery meschef of þe se eskape. But for al þat þou haddist a fel iape: For as þis auctor þi resort doþ wryte, He seith Vlixes, for al his wordis white, I-robbed was of riches and of good, Contrarious wynde so a-geyn him stood Þat he was drive, to his confusioun, In-to þe my?ty stronge regioun Where Thelamoun regned by his lyve; And þere he was hent &amp; take blyve, Be my?ti hond sesid by þe brest, And merciles put vnder arest; For þei him had suspect in werkyng, Touching þe mordre of þe same kyng. But he so wrou?t by his slei?ti wyle, And his tale sette in swiche a stile, Þat hem alle he [pleinly] hath be-iaped, And fro her hond frely is eskaped— Except þat he, for al his queynt[e] fare, Of his tresour was [y-]made ful bare; And for his passage was to him vnkouþe, He fil a-geyn in-to þe wolves mouþe: For, verraily, as it is specified, Kyng Naulus men han hym eft espied, Take &amp; bounde &amp; cheyned mercyles, For þe mordre of kyng Pallamydes. But þe story reherseth in certeyn, By his prudence he eskaped is a-geyn, —For he was boþe expert, wys, &amp; olde— Al-þei þe maner be not fully tolde Of his eskape, þoru? his besy peyne, Out of daunger of þese kynges tweyne— Til þoru? fortune he cam fro meschef fre To þe presence of kyng Ydumee In symple array and torne apparaile. Wher-of þe kyng gretly gan mervaile To sen his pouert in so lowe maner; But for al þat he maked him good cher,— Þou? þilke tyme he were Infortunat, He hym resseiveth liche to his estat. And whan þei wern boþe tweyne allone, In compleynyng Vlixes made his mone Vn-to þe kyng, as he þat was ful sage, Ceriously þe sort of his passage, With face sad and a sobre chere, Fro point to point, anon as ?e shal here. “My lord,” quod he, “shortly to expresse, Of trust I haue in ?oure gentilnes, I shal to ?ow myn aventures alle Rehersyn her, ri?t as it is falle: First, whan þat I Troye lond forsook And þe water with my shippes took, I was a-noon with wynde pesible blowe To an yle whiche was to me vnknowe, Callid Mirma, of gret haboundance; And al[le] þing þat was to my plesaunce, Þat may for siluer or for gold be bou?t, I redy fonde, &amp; wantid ri?t nou?t, And þer abood ful long[e] while in Ioie With þe tresour þat I gat at Troye,— My shippes stuffed, my men hool &amp; sounde, And for commodite of þat ilk[e] grounde, We lyked so þe contre enviroun, Þat, for disport and recreacioun, Oure tariyng þer we þou?t not longe, For no man dide vn-to vs no wronge. Til on a day þat þe eyr was stille, Þe wynde also fully at oure wille, We seyled forþe in quiete and in pes Vn-to a port called Clanstafages, Wher with my meyne long &amp; many day I fond al þing according to my pay, —Þe wedir lusty, agreable, and feir— But who may trust ouþer in wynde or eyr!— For vp-on feith of þe smoþe skye Ageyn to ship fast I gan me hye, Taried nou?t, but tok anoon þe see, Smoþe &amp; calm enduring daies þre, Þat in þe wedir founde was no lak. But sodeynly þe heuene turned blak, Þe hydous tempest &amp; þe wawes grene Oute of hope han me dispeired clene, Troublid my spirit &amp; made me [so] pensif, With-oute refut teskape with þe lyf, Possid &amp; drive by many sondri yle, Til at þe last, cast vp at Cecyle, Recuryng lond with gret annoy &amp; peyne, Wher þilke tyme regned kynges tweyne. And as I can remembre douteles, Þe ton of hem called Sorigenes, Whiche vn-to me ful contrarious was, And þe toþer named Coclopas,— Breþren of birþe, and, in conclusioun, I-lyche cruel of condicioun: For þou? my sort had shape for þe nonys, Boþe tweyne fil on me attonys, Oppressing me in ful gret distresse, Spoiled my shipes of tresour &amp; richesse, And for no pite liked not to spare, Til I was left destitut and bare Of al my good, allas, my mortal chaunce! And most of al was to me grevaunce, Whan of my gold þei my?t no more restreyne, Þei sent doun her my?ti sonys tweyne: Alipham, þat was ful large &amp; long, And Polipheme þe my?ti geaunt strong, Whiche on my men tavenge hem wer so fayn, Þat þei of hem han an hundred slayn, Disaraied to stonden at diffence. And of malys, with sodeyn violence Þei token me, for meschef almost lorn, And Alphenor, myn owne broþer sworn, And hatfully, as þei han vs founde, In cheynes cast and in stokkys bounde, And after þat ylokked in presoun. And for to make platly mencioun, Þis my?ti man, þis gret[e] Polypheme, A suster had, shortly for to deme, Oon þe fairest þat euer ?it was born— She my?t in bewte so be set a-forn, Nature hir gaf swiche a prerogatyf— A clene mayde, sothly, &amp; no wyf, Flouryng boþe in fairnes &amp; bounte, Whom Alphenor whan he dide se, Al-be he was fetrid in prisoun, For loue he lost wit &amp; eke resoun, And wex al mad, so na[r]we she dide him binde, —Saue [vp-]on hir alwey was his mynde, And closid ay was his perlous wounde. And sixe monþes þus we leie bo[u]nde, Boþe he &amp; I, to seyn þe plat[te] trouþe, Til Polypheme had vp-on vs rouþe; And þoru? his grace and mediacioun He quyt vs fre out of þat prisoun, And shewed vs, of mercy and pite, After oure sorwe gret humanite. But Alphenor, yliche of oon entent, Was with þe brond of Cupide brent, And felt his part with many mortal fyt, Til he so wrou?t by his sotil wyt, Þat on a ny?t, who was lef or loþe, He stale þis mayde, &amp; his weye he goþe, Þoru? help of men with him at þat tyme. But on þe morwe at þe hour of pryme Poliphemus gan vs for to sewe, Whos my?ti hond we my?t[e] nat eschewe; And swiche a-saut on vs þei gan make, Þat of force þei han þe mayde take From Alphenor, maugre al his rage. And Polypheme vn-to my damage With his kny?tes so sore vp-on me lay, Þat I my?t vnneþe eskape a-way To saue my lyf, compassid enviroun, To deth purswyd of þat champioun. But whan I sawe þer was non oþer geyn, To fle þe deth, shortly for to seyn, While þis geaunt most fersly on me sette With my swerd oute his eye I smette; And vn-to ship with my companye I fledde in haste, þat no man my?t espie Where I be-cam, nor Alphenor my fere. And whan þe wawes gon[ne] for to clere, And gracious wynd gan to vs awake, Þilk contre we han anoon forsake— It was nat holsom for vs to abide.” —But of þis man like as writ Ovide, Poliphemus þe geaunt, out of drede, Had an eye mydde of his forhede, Whiche Vlixes smot out at a stroke; And like þe bowes of a braunchid oke Was al his heer &amp; his longe berde,— On whom to loke childer were a-ferd. And whan þat he had[de] lost his si?t, A-monge þe hilles he renneth day &amp; ny?t, In a rage, to fynde hym som refuge, Cast[e] roches and grete stones huge On euery part enviroun þe contre, On Vlixes avenged for to be. Þus seith Ovide, in conclusioun, In his boke of transformacioun— Methamorphoseos—þer ?e may it se, Whan-so-euere þat ?our leyser be Ceriously þe story for to rede. And in writinge forþe I wil procede, How Vlixes, with face ded and pale, To Ydumee told[e] forþe his tale, Rehersyng þus, supprised &amp; a-wapid: “Fro Polipheme whan we wern eskaped, Þoru? oure vnhap and infelicyte In-to an yle myddes of þe see We were dryve, whan it gan to ny?te; And Elodium þat litel kyngdam hy?te, Wher þat Circes, þe gret enchaunteresse, Þilke tyme was lady and goddesse, Þat koude hir craft so wonderly performe, Al sodeynly a man for to transforme To haue þe liknes (&amp; lesen his resoun) Of hors or bere, tigre or lyoun, Wolf or fox, or what hir list deuise— Hir dredful craft was shapen in swiche wise, So my?ti wern hir straunge pociouns, Her letuarye[s] and confecciouns. And she also so fair vp-on to se, Þat fro hir power to man my?t[e] fle. For be þe werke of þis sorceresse, I was so fonned vppon hir fairnesse, Þat finally þus with me it stood: Þat al a ?ere I with hir [a]bood, And pleynly had power noon ne my?t For to depart, nouþer day ne ny?t, So lusti was þe lyf þat I ladde,— In whiche tyme by me a child she hadde, Ri?t inly fair &amp; goodly to þe si?t.” —And Thelagonivs in sothnes he hi?t, Whiche afterward, I [wel] reherse can, By processe wex a manly man.— “And be my sotil secre prouidence, Of hir craft I hadde experience, Þat maugre hir enchauntementes olde, I stale a-way—she my?t[e] me nat holde. And finally my fate to conclude, With my konnyng hir craft I gan delude, Þat with my men I skaped fro her hond And went at large fre out of hir lond. But al þis þing me litel dide availe; For on my way as I gan to saile, For al my slei?t, in a litel while I blowe was vp in-to an yle Wher Calypha, suster to Circes, Was crowned quene, &amp; held her scepter in pes; Whos craftis wern so my?ty &amp; so strong, Maugre my wil she held me þer ful long. But she, in soþe, to speke of wommanhed, Of bounte, fredam, and of goodlyhed, Surly had so souereyn excellence, Þat myn abood to me was noon offence. But who-so-euere þer-at crye or clappe, At þe last I skaped fro hir trappe And cam to an yle, ri?t as any lyne, Whiche specialy þoru? hi? power devyne Ordeyned is of ?ore be myracle, As it were, a spiritual oracle— A man to haue in a temple þere Sodeyn answere of what him list enquere, Of questiouns and demaundes alle, And of soule[s] what shal eke be-falle Whan men ar dede &amp; graven vnder stoon. And I gan axe in þe temple anoon Myn aventures þat shuld after swe, And wher a man my?t his fate eschewe; And of al þis, lyk to myn entent, I had answere ful conuenient— Saue what befalleth whan a soule is goon, Diffynycioun vn-to me was noon, Swiche þing tasoile acordeþ nat to ri?t: It is reserued vn-to Goddes my?t, And excedeth resoun &amp; wit of man. And fro þens forþe to seile I gan, Dreven with wynde, &amp; no part socoured, Wher I was lyk to haue be deuourid Of Caribdis, with his profounde welle, Where Sirenes, Meremaydnes, dwelle, Þat fro þe brest, with skalis siluer shene, Ben of her shap fysches freshe &amp; clene, And vpper-more, Kynde doth compasse Hem to apere femynyn of face, Lyk virgines þat were of nature With-oute spot, vndefouled pure. And of custom, in wawis as þei flete, Þe song of hem is so heuenly swete, So angelik and ful of armonye, Þat verrailly þe sugred melodie Ravisshe wolde any man a-lyve, Of inly Ioie almost his hert[e] ryue— Make a man, of sodeyn hi?e plesaunce, For?ete hym silf &amp; lese his remembraunce, Devoide hym clene from his owne þou?t, Til vnwarly he be to meschef brou?t. And with her song, or he take kepe, He shal be brou?t in a mortal slepe; And þei anoon—it may not be withdrawe— Wil drenche his ship lowe vnder þe wawe! Þus þe swetnes of her heuenly soun Bringeth a man to confusioun— Who-so-euere by her boundis pace. But with þe lif I eskaped by grace: For myn erys with wex &amp; gommys clere Were stoppid so, þat I ne my?t[e] here Touche nor werble of her instrumentis, Wher-by þe resoun of [a] man y-blent is. And, finally, þoru? my sotilte, I and my men ben eskapid fre, Seiling forþe, al mat of werynesse, Til we cam vp, with ful gret distresse, At Phenyce, &amp; toke a-noon þe lond, Cast anker, and oure shippes bond. But, sothly, þer it fil vs ful vnfaire; For þe peple, cruel and contraire, Only of malis fil on me anoon, And slowe my men almost euerychon; Tresour &amp; good, litel þat I hadde, Was me by-raft; and al with hem þei ladde; And fewe of hem þat wer left alive, Þei token hem &amp; put in prisoun blyve. Þus haþ Fortune lad me on her daunce With litel Ioie and plente of meschaunce, Of whos daunger lerned and expert, I am falle in meschef and pouert; And with gret dool &amp; sorwe ful my brest, On se and londe, by souþe &amp; nat by est I am com vn-to ?oure presence, And haue declared pleinly in sentence Myn auentures to ?oure worþinesse, Of trust only and of feithfulnesse Þat I haue to ?ow in special. And now I haue rehersid &amp; told al To ?oure hi?nesse in my best[e] wyse, With-oute more—to me it doth suffise.” Of þe grete comforte that kynge Ydumeus shewed to Vlyxes; and howe kynge Alpheon, for his grete wysdam, ressavyd hym worshipfully, and conveyed hym to his kyngdam. And þau? in hert he was constreyned sore, Þilk[e] tyme Vlixes spak no more, But held his pes, ful hevy in lokyng. And Ydumeus lik a gentil kyng Counforted hym al þat euere he my?t, And besy was his hert[e] for to li?t, And hym besou?t his heuynes[se] lete, And as long as hym list in Crete With hym abide,—he made hym surete He shuld[e] faren also wel as he, And nat want of what may do him ese. And whan his sorwe som-what gan apese, Þat his rage drow vn-to an ende, Leue he toke, &amp; seide he wolde wende Oute of þat londe home to his contre. But first þe kyng, of fredam &amp; bounte, ?af vn-to hym gret riches and array, And what-so-euere was vn-to his pay, Gold, tresour, &amp; many oþer þinges; And at þe partynge of þese tweyne kynges Þere wer shippes whan him list to saile, Redy stuffid with meyne and vitaile. And þus Vlixes gan hym redy make; And whan he haþe his leue fully take, He hasted hym &amp; toke anoon þe se, And gan saile toward his contre. But first he went to kyng Alphenoun, Whiche passingly hadde affeccioun To sen Vlixes at his home-comyng, And desirous ouer al[le] thing To han of hym newly aqueyntaunce: For vn-to hym was inly gret plesaunce To here hym talke, for his elloquence, For his wysdam &amp; his hi?e prudence And þer he was, after al his smert, Receyved pleinly with a[s] glad [an] hert As euere ?it was any maner man Siþen tyme þat þe world be-gan; And to encres of his Felicite, Þer herd he first of Penolope, His trewe wyf, with-oute spot or blame, Of whom ?it grene is þe noble fame, Whiche from hir lord, for al his long absence, In þou?t nor dede nevir dide offence, But sothly was, boþe in chere &amp; dede, Þoru?-oute Grece example of wommanhede. And ?it was she, as bokes list expresse, Þoru?-oute þe world merour of fairnes, And among Grekis born of hi?est blood, Called of auctours boþe fair and good; And ?it seyn bokes of hir, douteles, Was neuer noon þat had so gret pres, But she hir kepte, chaunging for no newe, Vn-to hir lord euere I-liche trewe, Of hert [ay] oon, nat partid in-to tweyne, Þat she is called quene &amp; souereyne Of wyfly trouþe in þis bokis olde. And oft, I fynde, hir hert[e] wold[e] colde, She turne pale for hir lord so ferre, In hir closet to heren of þe werre, Of drede she had, &amp; for fere eke quake, Of fantasies for hir lordes sake; For his absence, boþe eve &amp; morwe, Was deth to hir &amp; importable sorwe. And ay, in sothe, for Ioie or any game, Whan it fel she herd Hectoris name, In any place anoon she fil a-swowne, And gan hir silf al in teris drowne, Of wommanhed so she was a-ferde To here þe slau?ter of his mortal swerde, List hir lord, of kny?tly surquedie, Hadde of fortune falle in iupartye, Of hap or sort tamet þat worþi kny?t, Þat selde or neuer she felt hir hert[e] li?t. And many a dreme a-ny?tes dide hir gaste, Al þe while þat þe sege laste; And euery play was venym in hir si?t, Whan þat she was from hir owne kny?t: For in þis world she had Ioie noon Of hi?e nor lowe, pleinly, but of oon, For whos sake al myrþe she refuseth. And who-so be þat in his hert[e] museth Of any womman any þing but good, Of malencolye mevid in his blood, Lat hym aduerte of wisdam and [y-]se, And remembre on Penolope, For his decert list þat he be blamyd! And, o Guydo, þou shuldest ben ashamed To seyn of wyves any þing but wele: For, in good feith, as fer as I can fele, Þou? oon or two do among offence, She þat is good þoru? hir prouidence Is þer-of no þing for to wyte. And þou? Guydo in his boke endite Þe variaunce of Eleyne or Cryseyde, Or Medea, þat for sorwe deyde, Lete þer ageyn, of ri?t and equite, Þe wyfly trowþe of Penolope, Þe maydenhed of ?ong[e] Policene, And þe goodnes of Eccuba þe quene, Of Cassandra eke þe stedfastnes,— And with al þis, take þe kyndenes Of Pantasile, with-oute variaunce, And put al þis to-gidre in balaunce, And ?e shal fynde, ?if ?e list acounte, Maugre who grucchiþ, trouth[e] shal surmounte,— I dar aferme—&amp; bere a-weye þe pris: Þer wil no man replie þat is wys,— He were to feble in his oppinioun! And while Vlixes was with Alphenoun, It was to hym made relacioun Of an hatful conspiracioun, Þat certeyn lordis enviroun his contre Ravisshe wolde his quene Penolope, Maugre alle þo þat were þer ageyn, Al-be þat she was euere I-like pleyn, In hir trouþe stidefast as a wal. ?et þei haue cast, pleynly, þat she shal Be take of force, it may nat be eschewed, But it so be in haste she be reskewed: For þei hem cast þe tyme nat aiourne; For day and ny?t with hir [þei] soiourne, Inly in herte for loue disamaied. But of wisdam she haþe hem so delaied, Þat þer was noon so manly nor so sage, Þat koude of hir geten avauntage, So avise she was in hir wirkyng. And whan Vlixes conceyved al þis þing, And fully knewe by open evidence, And also [had] in special credence Sent vn-to hym fro Penolope, Þe mater hool declaringe in secre, His owne sone Thelamonevs, He wexe in herte wood and furious, And wolde make no delacioun, But in al haste besou?te Alphenoun, Þe my?ti kyng, of his hi? bounte To releue hym in his aduersite, And þat he wold þoru? his my?ti hond Of gentilnes conveye hym to his lond. He graunteþ hym &amp; seiþ nat onys nay; And boþe two in ful gret array Taken þe se whan þe wynd was good; Wel fortuned, for no þing hem with-stood, Þei be arived &amp; hadde no lettyng, Wher Vlixes, as ?e han herd, was kyng. And secrely a-ny?t þei wer conveied To hem þat han his ligaunce disobeied; And merciles, or þei my?t a-wake, In her beddes þei han hem alle take, Makyng noon prolongyng til þe morwe, But in al hast, for no wy?t durst hem borwe, Smet of her hedes by iugement final And set hem vp on þe castel wal, Eueryche by oþer endelong þe rowe, Vp-on þe hour whan þe cok gan crowe. And þus al ny?t þei kept hem silf[e] cloos, Til þat Phebus meryly aroos In þe orient, whan þe larke song; And þo þis kynges with her meyne strong, Freshely beseyn, entre þe cite. Who was þo glad but Penolope! Who made Ioie but þis goodly quene, Ful desirous hir owne lorde to sene! But ?if I shulde al in ordre sette, Þe grete myrþe þei made whan þei mette,— Make rehersaile of compleintes olde, And how þei gan her hertes to vnfolde Eche to oþer, and list no þing concele, And þe gladnes þat þei inly fele,— ?if I shulde put al in memorie, Þe reioisshinge and þe hertly glorie Þat his liges made at his comynge, Þe costis eke þei hadde at his metynge, Þe ?iftes grete and presentis riche, —In al þis world, I trow[e], noon I-liche— It were to long tariyng for my boke!— And how þat he newe assuraunce toke Of his lordis and his liges alle, And how þat þei to his grace falle, Þe chere he made eke to Alphenoun Of gentilnes þoru? his hi?e renoun, And how þe dou?ter, inly debonaire, Of Alphenoun, Nausia þe faire, By Vlixes mediacioun I-wedded was vn-to Thelamoun, Born by discent—þer may no man say nay— To reioisshe his crowne after his day: And þus cam in by his purviaunce Of two regnes þe my?ti alliaunce,— And how al þis brou?t was to þe knotte, Men wolde deme me pleinly to sotte, To presume of oppinioun For to delate a descripcioun, Siþen Guydo, touching but þe chef In þis mater, of stile was but bref, Shortly rehersing how kyng Alphenoun Repeired is hom to his regioun, And Vlixes in his chefe cite Abood stille with Penolope, Where I hym leue in Ioie and in solace Til Antropos likeþ to purchace For to ficche finally þe date, Þe thred [to] vntwyne of his lyues fate. Howe Pirrus, the sonn of Achilles, scleughe Menalippus and Polistines, sonnes to Atastus, which kept kenge Pelle out of his kyngdam, to þe which Pirrus restoryd him ageyne. Now mvste I ful besy ben a whyle, To directe þe tracis of my stile In discryving, shortly of entent, Þe stok of Pirrus by lyneal discent, Myn auctor folwe &amp; be compendious— Whos olde fader hi?te Pelleus, His granmoder called Thetides, Of whiche two cam worþi Achilles, Þat at Troye by tresoun lost his lyf; And Dardanya called was his wyf, Pirrus moder, &amp; dou?ter, as I rede, Vn-to þe kyng called Lycomede, Havyng a fader þat Atastus hi?te, Whiche, in sothnes, al þat euere he my?t Bare heuy herte to kyng Pelleus, To Achilles and also to Pirrus,— To al þe kyn, pleinly, on þat side. And of malis, rancour, &amp; of pride, And of envie in an hatful rage, Whan Pelleus falle was in age He beraft hym boþe septer and crowne, And from his se lowe ali?te him downe; And in-to exile, availle may no stryf, He made hym go with Thetides his wif, Of hi?e disdeyn,—geyne may no grace,— And in his hert gan day &amp; ny?t compasse Þe deth of Pirrus,—kepe him ?if he can!— And þer-vp-on maliciously began To shape a way, by await liggynge Hym for to slen at his home comynge. But þis Pirrus, from his treynes fre, Many daunger eskaped of þe se, Many wawe and many tempest wood, With gret[e] los boþe of men and good, At Malasus aldirfirst gan londe, A strong cite a litel fro þe stronde, Wher þat he was refreshed wonder wel. And þer he knewe grounde &amp; euerydel, First of þe exile, like as men hym tolde, Of Thetides and Pelleus þe olde, And how Atastus bar to hym hatrede Vn-to þe deth; wher-of he gan drede, And þou?t he wolde, as he þat was ri?t wys, Be som engyn eschewen his malys, And þer-vp-on don his besy peyne. Now hadde Atastus oþer sonys tweyne, Menalippus and Polistenes, And a dou?ter called Thetides. And al þis while woful Pelleus, In a castel olde and ruynous, With Thetides, ful of sorwe and care, For drede of deth day &amp; ny?t gan dare, Dis[es]peired in his vnweldy age Recur to finde of þis mortal rage, Except þat he had an hope of ?ore Þat Pirrus shuld help him and restore At his repeir, whan-so þat it falle— After whos comyng often he gan calle, Þe tyme curse þat he so long abood. But whan Pirrus al þis vndirstood At Malasus by relacioun, Ful faste he gan haste oute of þe toun, Toke þe se and faste gan hym hy?e Toward þe lond called Thesalye, Of entent to maken ordinaunce On Atastus for to do vengaunce. But aldirfirst, þis Pirrus ful prudent, Espies tweyne he to-forn hath sent To Thesalye forþe to-gidre goon; And Crilippus called was þe ton, And Adrastus named was his fere— Þei wern expert, hem nedeth nat to lere. In whos expleit, to more avauntage, Þis Pirrus haþe direct his message Of Thesalye to a cite?eyn Called Assandrus, a maner chamberleyn With Pelleus, and whilom ful secre While he was flouringe in felicite. And whan Pirrus, in conclusioun, Knewe al þe sothe by relacioun, On se nor lond hym ne list to tarie, Al-be þat he fond þe wynde contrarie; But he, eskaped many dredful stoundis, Of Thesalye aprocheþ to þe boundis: For Eolus hath his lust obeied, And, of fortune wonderly conveied, He driven was, as it wer, by grace To ariven in þe same place Wher Pelleus in a doolful cave For drede of deth lay hym silf to saue, Soule saue his wyf, with-outen any feris, Al enclosed with busshes and with breris. And Pirrus þer went vp first to londe, Sool by hym silf walkyng on þe stronde, Pensif and trist, and his weye toke Where Pelleus in þe caue quoke, Hauyng with hym þo noon oþer guyde Saue his swerd hangynge by his syde. And vnwarly, with a dredful hert, Pelleus oute of þe caue sterte Disamayed, of his lyf in doute, Whan he behelde a kny?t þere walke aboute, And astonyd abood &amp; stood ful stille, Imaginynge þat he sawe Achille, By þis Pirrus stondyng in þe place, By alle þe signes shewid in his face: For nature, with-oute variaunce, Made hem so lik of chere &amp; contenaunce, Of forme, of shap, and lymys euerychon, Þat difference in effect was noon. And Pelleus, with-oute lenger space, Gan anoon Pirrus to enbrace, And abraide oute of his dedly þou?t, And for Ioie sette al his sorwe at nou?t; And gan to hym by &amp; by declare Boþe his exile and his euele fare, His pitous lyf, his pouert &amp; meschaunce, And Fortunys fals[e] variaunce, And of Adastus þe feruent hoot envie, Þe cruelte and þe tyranye— Ceriously he told Pirrus al. And he, ful sobre, stood stille as a wal. With face pale and in hert[e] wroth, Specheles to ship a-geyn he gooth; And þer [he] was informed, dout[e]les, Þat Menalippus and Polistenes And Adastus, to-gidre alle þre, With huge array and a gret meyne Þe same day, ful surquedous of pride, Hunte a forest, a litel þere beside. And whan Pirrus þer-of toke good hede, With-oute a-bood chaunge gan his wede, Ful porely, rent, and disarayed, —Liche a man þat were for þou?t dismaied— Girt with his swerde, made no delay, But to þe forest toke þe ry?t[e] way, Sool by hym silf, with-oute companye, So secrely þat no man my?t espie. And as he drewe many diuers boundis, He herd[e] hornes &amp; vncouplyng of houndis; And, like a man þat list make his mone Fro si?t of folke, he drewe him ay allone. And, casuely disseuered fro þe pres, First he mette with Polistenes, Menalippus ridyng by his side; And boþe two on Pirrus gan abide, And boistously of hym to enquere Fro whens he cam &amp; also what he were, So febly clad and of so pore estate, Walkyng þere as he were disolat. And lowly he of chere &amp; contenaunce, Stille and humble in his dalliaunce, Answerid ageyn, &amp; seyde how þat he Fordriven was with meschef of þe se, And affermyd, pale &amp; no þing red, His felaship drowned was and ded— Fyve hundrid—þe wawes were so rage— Of olde &amp; ?onge and of mydel age— And he eskaped—þe tempest was so rif, As he hem tolde,—vnneþe with þe lyf. And, ouer-more, he tolde hem platly eke, Towching his birþe, þat he was a Greke, And went[e] þer, destitut of Ioie, Late comen fro þe sege of Troye, And besou?t hem toward his lyving To helpen hym with som refreshing, As hym þat had catel loste and good, Like as þei sawe naked how he stood, Praiyng also, in hope it shulde availe, Hym to releue with cloþing or vitaile, To his refut sumwat to prouide. And þei bad hym þat he shuld abide; For þei wil wit, pleynly, what he can. And þilk[e] whyle be-sides hem þer ran A ful gret hert doun by þe riuer; And Menalippus priked his courser, As hym sempte it was to hym dewe, Þoru? þinne &amp; þikke only to purswe He spareth nat, but alweye after rood; And his broþer with Pirrus stille abood— Polistenes—and toke of it noon hede, But in al haste a-li?te fro his stede, On þe grene to reste hym þer beside, As he þat was wery for to ryde, With-oute meyne beyng hym silf[e] sool, Lestynge of Pirrus þe compleint &amp; þe dool. But sodeynly, or he my?t aduerte, Cruel Pirrus ran hym to þe herte, And left hym ded, lyggynge on þe plein. Whan Menalippus repeired was ageyn, Seynge his broþer baskyng in his blood, And Pirrus eft, furious and wood, With a face of colour pale and wan, To Menalippus in his ire ran, And slowe hym eke, or þat he toke hede. And þus þei laie on þe grounde &amp; blede, Þe breþer two, with Pirrus swerd I-slawe. And he anon aside gan hym drawe, Metyng a kny?t, wer it of sort or cas, As seith þe story, called Cynaras, Of whom Pirrus gan in hast enquere, Whos man he was or what he dide [t]here; And he answered, &amp; made no tariynge, He was servaunte with þe my?ti kyng Called Atastus, lord of þat contre. And Pirrus þo, of dedly enmyte, With cruel swerde, al freshe &amp; red of blod, Ran hym þoru?-oute, as any lyoun wood. And after þat þe forest he forsoke, And in al hast þe ri?t[e] weye he toke To ship ageyn, pale &amp; blak of hewe, And gan anon to araie hym newe, Al in purpil, whiche, as clerkes telles, Is for kynges &amp; for no wy?t elles. And þanne Pirrus, freshe &amp; wel be-seyn, To þe forest repeired is ageyn, Wher sodeynly of hap in his walkyng In short while he mette with þe kyng, Old Atastus, þat asked of Pirrus, “What man art þou, [þat] be þi silf[e] þus Walkest þus [here] al day to and fro?” “Certes,” quod Pirrus, “ful of sorwe &amp; wo, Inly supprisid of hertly compleynyng, Oon of þe sonys of Priamus þe kyng I was whilom, put oute of memorie, Whan þat Troye floured in his glorie, Now refutles, in-to meschef brou?t, I walke sool, ful of care &amp; þou?t, Fer in exile oute of Troie toun, With cruel Pirrus to lyven in presoun, Bounde vn-to hym, þou? me be ful loth, Myn hond assured with many ful gret oth Tobeye his lust in captiuite— Lo, here is al,—þus it stant with me!” Howe Atastus enquyred of Pirrus if he knewe ought of Pirrus governance, and Pirrus made him a synge to þe Cave wher Pelle was, to thentent to scley hym in lokenge thidere. Atastus þo, of entencioun, After many oþer questioun, Enquered of hym in his daliaunce, ?if he knewe ou?t of Pirrus gouernaunce, Or ?if þat he koude ou?t vnderstonde Wher he hym kepte sith he cam to londe. “I-wis,” quod he, “?if ?e list hym haue, He kepiþ hym cloos in þe ?onder cave Amonge bruskaile with a shrouded face,”— Makyng a signe to þe same place. And al was doon for an ydel ma?e: For while þe kyng þedirward gan ga?e, Hasti Pirrus gan his swerd oute drawe In purpos ful Atastus to haue slawe; But wonderly, þe story can ?ow lere, Quene Thetides dide anoon appere, Al be-reyned with terys on hir face, And gan þe swerd of Pirrus to embrace, Preiyng him his dedly hond restreyne. “Hastow nat slayn my ?ong[e] breþer tweyne?— And now, allas! my fader, hoor and gray, Merciles fro me wilt take a-way? Put vp þi swerde! &amp; no blood ne shede! And haue pite vp-on þi kynrede, And aduerte clerly to þe fyn, How þou art come of þe same lyne, And hatful is, who-so loke a-ri?t, Vnkynde blood in euery mannys si?t.” And Pirrus þo, as any tigre wroþe, Gan afferme, with many ful gret oþe, Þat who-so grucche or a-geyn[e]s pleyne, He shal hym sleen with his hondis tweyne: “For hath nat he be fals extorcioun Put Pelleus oute of his regioun, Whiche is ?our lord, &amp; ?e his trewe wif?— Þat finally he shal lese his lyf, And here anoon of myn hondis deye;— In þis mater þer is no more to seye.” But Pelleus, darynge in þe cave, Of grace only list his lif to saue— Al oþer help platly is for nou?t. And Pelleus was anoon forþe brou?t, Croked &amp; olde, vnweldy eke to se, And to-fore Pirrus fil doun on his kne, Beseching hym with a pitous face At his request taken hym to grace, And þat he wold in his manly herte Goodly considre þe dedly wo &amp; smerte Of Atastus, and þe mortal peyne Þat he hadde for his sonys tweyne, Whiche laie ded to-forn hym on þe grene, “Slayn with ?our swerde þat is so sharp &amp; kene, Whiche he ne may recuren in no wyse, Þe sorwe of whiche ou?t I-now suffyse, Þou? ?e on hym do no more vengaunce: Al þis peised iustly in balaunce; Sith he is hooly submitted to ?our my?t, Takeþ now hym to merci anoon ri?t, And late ?oure swerd his age not consume— Þis my request, as I dar presume.” And þanne Pirrus, shortly for to seyn, Whan he hadde put vp his swerd ageyn, Seynge merci my?t[e] most availe, With-oute wordis or any rehersaile, First of al, to-forn hem euerychon, Þe kynges made accorden in-to oon, By his wisdam, concluding vp in dede, Þat eche of hem shulde his ri?t possede In Thesalye, parted in-to tweyne, Þat nouþer hadde mater to compleyne, Eueryche to regne in his dewe se. And while þei were to-gidre alle þre, Oute of presence of any oþer man, Atastus first þus his tale gan: Howe Atastus resygnede his parte of the kyngdam of Thesalye to his cosyne Pirrus. “Sirs,” quod he, “to ?ow is nat vnknowe How þoru? age now I am brou?t lowe, And þoru? naturis kyndly mocyoun Am wexe feble of wyt and [of] resoun, Beyng vnweldy of my lymes alle —So many ?eris arn vp-on me falle— And can vneþe any þing discerne, To feble, in soth, a kyngdam to gouerne, Of lyf nor deth takyng now noon hede, Sith my sonys slay[e]n ben and dede, And sool am left now with-oute eyr, Of worldly lust fully in dispeir, Þe tyme passed of my felicite. Fortunys turne with mvtabilite Hath tau?t me, pleinly, I dar it wel expresse, In worldly Ioie is no sikernesse, Nor verray trust no while to abide; But I wil now for my silf prouide, And in al hast, by prudent puruyaunce, Me discharge of al gouernaunce— Ageyn my sort me list not maligne; But septer &amp; crowne frely I resigne, Of Thesalye lordshipe &amp; eke lond Of my fre wil hool in-to þin hond,— Þer schal no man reclayme nor seye nay, Interupte nor make no delay Touching þis þing, by no collusioun, For I þe putte in pocessioun.” And, here-vp-on, of al þat euere he seide Makyng ful feith, his hond in his he leide, Quene Thetides sittyng þere present. And Pelleus, of þe same entent, Vn-to Pirrus for his purpa[r]tye Resigned eke þe ri?t of Thesalye, Fully affermyng þat of ?ore a-go His ful desire and his Ioie also Was euere in oon his nevew to succede, As ri?tful eyr his kyngdam to possede, “And outerly, with-oute repentaunce, Al þat longeþ [vn-]to my lig[e]aunce, Septer &amp; swerd, crowne &amp; diademe, So as a kyng lyf and deth to deme, In-to þin hond, with-oute lenger date, Þis same houre hooly I translate.” And whan þe knotte of þis conuencioun Was fully brou?t to conclusioun, Parformyd vp hool þe vnite For euermore, atwen þese kynges þre, Atastus kny?tes, disseuered enviroun, Oute of þe forest be descended doun, And be bidding, platly, of her lord Þei were echon sworn to þis acord. And attonis þis lusti companye To Thesalye fast[e] gan hem hi?e; And Pirrus folke, ligginge on þe se, Be seiled forþe, streit to þe cite. And Atastus doth sette a parlement, Where openly he gaf commaundement Þat alle his liges, of hi?e or lowe estat, With-oute strif or any more debate, Specially of gentil blod y-born, Þe same day to Pirrus to be sworn Like her degres in þe royal halle, To perseuere his trew[e] liges alle Durynge her lyf, for ernest or for game. And Pelleus commaunded haþe þe same For his parti, with-outen any fraude. And þus with Ioie &amp; solemne laude, Pirrus was of euery maner age Gladly accepted to his heritage. And on a day fortunat and good, With glad aspectus whan þe heuene stood, Wel according to swiche maner þing, Worþi Pirrus was y-crowned kyng Of Thesalye, þe riche regioun— It were but veyn to make mencioun Of her reuel ne her gret array, Nor of þe fest made þe same day, Eke in þe story I fynde it nat, in soth. I wyl passe ouer as myn auctor doth— Saue in his boke it is specefied Þat þe kyngdam was fer magnified Of Thesalye by þe grete my?t Of þis Pirrus, whilom so good a kny?t, Where I leue hym in his royal se, Tournyng agayn to kyng Ydumee, Whiche in þis while was graue vnder stoon. And after hym, his sone Mereoun, Þe story seith, was crownyd king of Crete; But a while regnyng in quyete, He deide also—it wold[e] be noon oþer. And þanne anon Leorica, his broþer, As ri?tful eyr be successioun Was crowned kyng of þat regioun, In whiche tyme Atastus, out of drede, By þassent of Pirrus, as I rede, Ful besi was to make in special A riche toumbe, passyngly royal, Where buried wern with ful huge pres Menalippus and Polistenes, Boþe two in þe forest slawe Þoru? Pirrus swerde, be ful cruel lawe— Of hem can I noon oþer processe make, But euene her fully my leve I take Of hem boþe, and also eke yfere Of Atastus, her owne fader dere, Of whom, sothly, for al his lokkes hore, In Troye boke rede I can no more. But now mvst I ageyn to Pirrus wende, To write of hym þe sory woful ende, Whiche, whan he sat hi?est in his se, Made ful blind with veyn prosperite, Gouernyng þe lond of Thesalye, He falsly fil in-to a fantasie To sette his loue on Hermyon þe quene, Horestes wyf, regnynge in Methene, For whom he brent hoot as any fyre. And in fulfillyng of his foule desire, His purpos hool þus he brou?t aboute: Hir rauyssynge whil hir lord was oute, Lad hir hoom &amp; hilde hir as his wyf, Semyng to hym it was a blisful lyf And ful reles of his peynes smerte. Of whiche Horestes bar ful hevy herte, And cast hym pleynly avengid for to be Whan he may haue opportunyte; For þilk[e] tyme, þou? he had[de] wrong, He was to feble &amp; Pirrus was to strong. Whiche held also, in stori it is tolde, Andronomeca with hym in housholde, Hectoris wyf, by whom whylom she had A litel child, whiche with hir she lad— Þe sege complet and destruccioun— Whan she was brou?t out of Troye toun: Lamedonta, I fynde, was his name, Encresyng after to ful worþi fame. And by Pirrus she had a sone also Called Achilleydos, so as writ Guydo; And þis wommen, for al hir gret estate, Atwen hem silf amonge wern at debate: And Hermonye, in hir Ire al hoot, In compleynyng to hir fader wrot Þat hir fere, for al hir hi?e degre, Andronomeca was cherisshed bet þan she Of kyng Pirrus, besechyng Menelay Tenhasten hym, in al þat euere he may, Come hym silf anoon þat it were do, To sle þis woman &amp; hir childe also. And he bood nat, but faste gan him hi?e, In an hete, towarde Thesalye To be venged with his swerde of stele Vp-on hir þat trespasseþ neuer-a-dele. But maugre hym, in al his cruelte, She was reskewed myd of þe cite. It is a þing whiche haþ nat ben herd: To a womman a kyng to drawe his swerd— I wil no more in þis mater dwelle, In maner shamed it to write or telle. How Cruelly kynge Horrestes, in the Tempylle of Appollo within the Ille of Delos, scleugh Pirrus, for that he had ravisshede quene Hermone, his wyff, and here kept in avoutreye. But þis was doon while Pirrus of corage To Delos was goon on pilgrymage, Havyng with hym but a litel rout, To Appollo to knelen &amp; to loute, For þe soule to preyen of Achille, And his avowes also to fulfille, And þanken hym with humble affeccioun Of good expleit he had at Troye toun, And for wreche, also, þat was take At þe cite for his faderis sake. But al þis þing here y-specified Kyng Horestes warly hath espied, And to Delos gan hasten him ful ri?t, Ledyng with hym many lusty kny?t; And vnwarly he with Pirrus mette, And vengably vp-on hym he sette, Þat finally in þat straunge londe Horestes slow hym with his owne hond. I fynde, in soth, he made no diffence, So sodeyn was þe mortal violence Of his enmy, he koude nat asterte: For or þat he my?t his swerd aduerte, He was on hym enviroun al be-set, Þilke tyme it my?t[e] be no bet; For þer was nouþer socour nor declyn. Þus was Pirrus brou?t vn-to his fyn, Late crowned kyng of Thesalye. Lo, here þe guerdoun of avout[e]rie! Lo, how þe mede and reward is ful rif, To mysuse anoþer mannys wyf! It is no drede, folowe shal vengaunce, Sodeyn deth, or vnwar meschaunce, Whiche euery man gretly ou?te charge. And in Delos in a temple large Kyng Pirrus was lokked vnder stoon; And Horestes forthe his weie is goon, And by force gat his wyf ageyn— Þer was no wy?t durste hym þo with-seyn— And to Methene proudly is repeired. And Thesalye, pitously dispeired, Destitut, as þei þat can no red, Whan þei wist her worþi kyng was ded— And eyr was noon, by successioun To gouerne þat noble regioun Saue Achilleydos, þat but litel a-forn In Pirrus abscence was in Grece born, Fully of age nat a quarter clene: Þe ?ouþe of whom, sothly, was to grene, Who liste considre, &amp; to tendre of my?t, Ful many day, to reioishe his ri?t, And to gouerne with septer in his hond Þe large boundis of so gret a lond. And ?it þis child, likly and ri?t faire, In verray soth was born to ben eyre After Pirrus: þis is þe trouth[e] pleyn— Þer was no man þat list it with-seyn. But, I fynde, whan he cam to age He resigned hool his herytage To his broþer frely and his ri?t— Lamedonte, a wonder manly kny?t, Þat was discendid of Troianysshe blood, Doun fro þe stook of hym þat was so good, Flour of kny?thod, diffence of Frigia, Þat hym begat on Andronomeca— Ordeyned now, who-so gruche or frowne, Of Thesalye for to bere þe crowne. And whan he was made lord of þat lond, And al was frely resigned to his hond, He hath comaunded, no man dar replie, Þoru? þe kyngdam of al Thesalye, Þat alle þat wern in captiuite Or prisoners of Troye þe cite, For loue or hate, excepcioun was noon, Þat alle shulde at her large goon, By ful assent of Achilleydos; And swiche as wern eke in presoun cloos, With-oute raunsoun shal deliuered be, And reioisshe þe fulle liberte By custom vsid, boþe in borwe &amp; toun, Of þe liges of þat regioun. And þus þe folke þat cam þral fro Troye Restored ben sodeinly to Ioie By Lamedonte, and I-maked fre. And he eke regned in his royal se Ful my?tely, as I haue made mynde;— In Troye boke no more of hym I finde, Nor of Pirrus, nor of his kynred. Fro hens forþe I can no processe rede, But incidentes þat bere no substaunce, Whiche were but veyn to put in remembrance, —Except myn auctor, I not to what entent, Here Impeth in a litel incident I-wrou?t &amp; doon of ful ?ore a-goon, Touching þe deth of þe kyng Menon, Whiche be envie of cruel Achilles Was slawe, in soth, among Mirundones, Only for he proudly gan purswe Vp-on Achilles Troylus to reskwe. Whom kyng Priam made buried be Beside Troylus in Troye þe cite, In a temple y-bilt of marbil olde. Howe quene Menone, longe aftire that she dyed, kam to þe towmbe of here husbonde, &amp; karide away his bones. And to what fyn [þat] þis tale is tolde, In þis chapitle I shal reherse anoon: Þe noble quene of þis kyng Menon, After þe tyme long &amp; many day Þat she was ded &amp; grauen vnder clay, At hys toumbe heuenly gan appere Al be-set with bri?t[e] sterris clere, Whos similitude, for to rekne al, Was lyke a þing þat were immortal, Þat no man my?t outterly sustene To beholde,—of lok she was so shene,— Doun discendyng fro þe firmament, Ful many man being þere present, Clad in a mantel ful celestial, And of hir port passingly royal, With swet[e]nes freshe as any rose,— Made in al haste þe toumbe to vnclose Of hir lord, &amp; takeþ oute þe bonys, And in a cheste made of gold &amp; stonys She couched hem, as fast as euer she may, Disapered, &amp; wente anoon hir way. And to-for þat nor after, in certeyn, In þilke place she was neuer seyn. Somme affermyng, as by liklynes, She was ouþer aungel or goddes, Þe soule or fate of þe same kyng— I can not deme in swiche heuenly þing, Nor þer-in holde noon oppinioun, For it transcendeth, shortly, my resoun. And me list nat in swiche mater diffyne, But resort ri?t as any lyne To Vlixes, &amp; a while dwelle, Of his ende þe surplus for to telle, And how þat he my?t[e] nat eskape Þe parodye, þat was for hym shap; For Parchas han his laste terme set, And Antropos mesured oute &amp; met His lyues þrede, on þe rokke sponne. Defende þi silf, Vlixes, ?if þou konne! Shewe þi manhod, &amp; be nat afferde, And be wel war of þi sonys swerde! For I shal now, lyk as I am wont, Sharpen my penne, boþe rude &amp; blont, To descryue þe fyn of þi soiour, Vp-on þe boundis set of my labour: For almost wery, feint &amp; waike I-now Be þe bestes &amp; oxes of my plow, Þe longe day ageyn þe hil to wende. But almost now at þe londes ende Of Troye boke, ficche I wil a stake, Saue I mote spende a fewe lines blake Þe laste chapitle shortly to translate Of al þis werke, and ympen in þe date Of þilke day deth sette on hym arest, Ful execute by hym he louede best. Of A wonderful dreme that kynge Vlyxes had, and þe last in his days, which was a[ss]ingede by his clerkes, that one next of his blode shulde gyve hym his dethes wounde. Lowe on my knees now I muste loute To þilk[e] god þat makeþ men to route, And causeth folke to haue glad[e] swevenes, Boþe at morwe &amp; on lusti evenes, Whan Morpheus, with his slepi wond, Whiche þat he holdeth alweie in his hond, Hath marked hem a-geyn þe dirke ny?t, To maken men boþe mery and ly?t, And somwhile for to han gladnes, And sodeynly to falle in hevynes, Lik as to hem he ?eveth euydence By sondry signes in his apparence. Vn-to þat lord now moste I mekely preie, At þis tyme my stile to conveye Of Vlixes þe dreme to discrive, Þe laste of alle he hadde be his lyue, Declaryng hym be tokenes ful notable And by signes verray demonstrable, As he slepte ageyn þe pale mone, His fatal day þat shulde folwe sone. For it fel þus: as he a-bedde lay, After mydny?t, to-fore þe morwe gray, Hym þou?t he sawe appere a creature To his si?t celestial of figure— Noon erthely þing, but verraily devyne, Of port, of chere wonder femynyne, And, as hym sempte in his fantasye, Like a þing sent oute of fair[i]e; For þe bewte of hir goodly face Recounforted, pleynly, al þe place, Moste surmountynge &amp; most souereyne; And þe clernes of hir eyne tweyne, Al sodeynli, or men my?t aduerte, Perce wolde euene to þe herte— Diffence noon my?t[e] be devysed. And Vlixes, with hir loke supprysed, Gan hir beholde al-weie more &amp; more, And in his slep for to si?e sore, Presyng ay with ful besy peyne Hir tenbracen in his armys tweyne; But ay þe more he presed hir to se, Ay þe more from hym [she] gan to fle; And ay þe more [þat] he gan purswe, She ageynwarde gan hym to eschwe, So contrarie to hym was fortune! And whan she sawe he was importune, She axed hym, shortly, what he wolde; And he to hir þe plat[te] trouþe tolde: “Certis,” quod he, “my lyues emperesse, Wher þat ?e ben woman or goddes I can not deme nor Iugen half ari?t, I am so dirked and blendid in my si?t; But I dar wel affermyn in þis place, My lyf, my deth stant hooly in ?our grace, More of merci requiryng þanne of ri?t To rewe on me, whiche am ?our owne kny?t, And of pite and compassioun Goodly to sen to myn sauacioun: For my desire but I may fulfille, Þis silf[e] ny?t to haue of ?ow my wille, To my recure I can no remedie, For lak of rouþe but I most[e] dye. Now haue I al, a-twexe hope &amp; drede, My silf declared to ?oure wommanhede.” And after þat she kepte hir clos a while, And ful sadly gan on hym to smyle, And, as it is put in remembraunce, Seyde vn-to hym, with sobre countenaunce: “Sothly,” quod she, “þin affeccioun Wolde fully turne to confusioun Of vs boþe, it is so perillous, So inly mortal and contagious, Þat outterly, þer geyn[e] may no red, But oon of vs moste anoon be ded— Þis is þe fyn of þe hatful chaunce Þat shulde folwe after oure plesaunce.” And as Vlixes gan to ney?e nere, Beholdyng ay on hir heuenly cher, Where-as she stood vpri?t on þe grounde, He sawe hir holde a spere longe &amp; rounde, Þe hed þer-of al of burned stele, Forged new &amp; grounde wonder wele; And þer-vppon in his avisioun He sawe a baner blased vp &amp; doun, Þe felde þer-of al [of] colour ynde, Ful of fysshes betyn, as I fynde, And in som bokys like as it is tolde, In þe myddes a large crowne of golde. And or þat she turne gan hir face, Likly anoon to parte oute of þe place, She spak to hym, &amp; seyde in wordes pleyn: “Þis ful tokene of partyng of vs tweyn For euere-more, nowþer for sour nor swete, After þis day neuer ageyn to mete!” And, disapering, anoon hir leue she toke. And after þat he sodeynly a-woke, And gan to mvse in his fantasie What þing þis dreme my?t[e] sygnyfie; But wher it ment owþer euel or good, Þe secrenes he nat vndirstood, For it surmountid, sothly, his resoun. Þer-fore he sent þoru? his regioun For swiche as wern sotil expositours Of fate or sort, or crafti devinours, For alle þe clerkis soget to his crowne, Tassemble in oon his sweuene to expowne. And whan þei knewe be informacioun Þe maner hool of his avisioun, Þei conclude, accordynge in-to oon, Þe tyme aprocheþ &amp; shal come anoon Þat oon þat is nexte of his kynrede With a spere shuld[e] make hym blede. —Lat se wher he his fate can remewe! Siþ it is hard destyne to eschewe, As seyn þo folke in þer oppinioun, Þat werke &amp; truste on constellacioun.— And Vlixes, mvsyng on þis tale, Chaungeth colour &amp; gan wexe pale, Wonder dredful &amp; ful of fantasies, Gan in hym-silf seke remedyes To voide a-weie þing þat wil nat be— He stareth brode, but he may nat se, His inward loke was with a cloude shent; But wenyng he to haue be prudent, Made calle his sone Thelamoun, And to be take &amp; shette vp in presoun, He supposyng fully in his wit Fro alle meschef þer-by to go quyte— He nat aduerteth nor ne toke noon hede To þe sharpnes of [þe] speris hed, Nor to þe fysshes in þe baner bete, Nor to þe se, wher þei swymme &amp; flete, Nor of þe quene þat called is Circes, Þat signes brou?t of werre &amp; nat of pes, Nor of þe crowne, tokene of dignite Of oon þat shal holde his royal se, Mid þe wawes, boþe fel &amp; wood, Amonge þe fysshes in þe large flood;— And he shal make þe devisioun, To-forne remembrid in thavisioun, Ageyn his wil, of verray ignoraunce, And execute þe fatal purueiaunce Vp of þe dreme with his spere of stele, Whiche Vlixes considereth neuere-a-dele, Nor to no wy?t hath suspecioun But to his sone called Thelamoun, Þat is closed &amp; shet vp in a tour. And Vlixes, with coste &amp; gret labour, Fro day to day doth his besynes For hym-silf to make a forterresse, Bilt on a roche, of lym &amp; square stonys, Depe diched aboute for þe nonys, Þat no man may entre on no side, Where he casteþ al his lyue tabide With certeyn men chose in special, Ni?t &amp; day to wache on þe wal Þat no wy?t shulde haue [noon] entre, But it so falle þat he be secre, Knowe of olde, and to counceil sworne. Now, as þe story rehersed hath to-forne, Þe olde fool, þis dotard Vlixes, A sone hadde be-geten on Circes— Freshe &amp; lusti, ?onge and coraious; And he was called Thelagonyus, Born in þe se amonge þe flodis rage, Þat was also, [for] to rekne his age, Fyue &amp; twenti ?ere or þere a-boute; But of his fader he was ay in doute What man he was or who it my?t[e] be, Beinge þere-of in noon-surete. Til on a day he, desirous to knowe, To his moder fil on knees lowe, Beseching hir, goodly (&amp; nat spare) Of his fader þe trouþe to declare; What he was, &amp; where he shulde dwelle, He besou?t þat she wolde telle. But, sothly, she long and many daies Of prudence put hym in delayes, Til þat she sawe she my?t haue no reste, So inportune he was in his requeste; And whanne she knewe þer was non oþer bote, Fro point to point she tolde hym crop &amp; rote Of Vlixes, &amp; where þat he was kyng. And he anoon made no lettyng, But toke leve—it may no better be— And seide pleinly he wolde his fader se; Wher-of þe quene gan in herte colde. But whan she sawe she my?t him nat with-holde, She hym besou?t, with chere debonaire, Þat he wolde sone ageyn repeire. And forthe he seileth onward on his wey, With-oute abood, þe silf[e] same day, By many port and many fer contre, Til he was brou?t þere he wolde be— To Achaia, a lond of gret renoun. And he gan cerche þoru? þe regioun After þe place and paleis principal Where-as þe kyng helde his se royal; And he so long in þe contre rood, Til he was tau?t where þe kyng abood, Þer Vlixes was shet vp in mewe, To whiche place in haste he gan purswe, A gret party releued of his sorwe. And on a Monday, erly be þe morwe, Vn-to þe brigge þe ri?t[e] weie he toke, And fond a porter deynous of his loke; And lowly first he gan hym to preie Þat he wold goodly hym conveie In-to þe courte, &amp; make no tariyng, For a message he hadde to þe kyng. But proudly he denyed hym þe gate, And shortly seide þat he cam to late To entre þere in any maner wyse, And vngoodly gan hym to dispise, Frowarde of speche and malicious. But in al haste Thelagonyus, As he þat was in herte nat afferde, Þe proude porter hent[e] be þe berde, And with his fyste brast his chawle boon, Þat he fil ded, mvet as a stoon; And oþer eke þat hym þo with-stood He made proudly to lepe in-to [þe] flood; And whan mo cam to make resistence, He hent a swerde, be manly violence, And furiously in his Irous tene (Þe story seith) he slowe of hem fiftene, Hym-silfe al-moste wounded to þe deth, And gan, for-wery, sothly, faile breth. And Vlixes, what for noise &amp; soun, To þe brigge is descendid doun, Findinge his men at entre of þe gate Ded &amp; slayn be ful mortal hate; And he ful Irous hent anoon a darte, Of auenture stonding þo a-parte, And cruelly caste at Thelagoun. But þe stroke, as in conclusioun, Damageth nat, for it glood a-side; And he for haste no lenger wolde abide, Hent vp þe darte, with-oute more areste, And smot þe kyng lowe vnder þe breste Þoru? þe ribbes, shortly for to seie, [Þat] Of þe wounde he moste [nedis] deie,— Having þo noon oppinioun Þat he was kyng, nor suspecioun, Nor þat he had his owne fader slawe. Whiche faste gan to his ende drawe; His wounde was so dedly &amp; so kene Þat he my?t him silve nat sustene, But pale &amp; wan to þe grounde gan glide, His men aboute vp-on euery side, Þat besy wern to help hym and releue. But his sore gan so ake and greve Þat he wel felte þat he mvste be ded; But abrayding, as he lifte vp his hed, Havyng as ?it mynde &amp; good resoun, Remembre gan on his avisioun, And how it was tolde him, oute of drede, Þat oon þat was nexte of hys kynrede, Descendid doun from his owne lyne, His sweuene shal parforme to þe fyne And a-complisshe with a dart of stele. And for he coude nat conceyve wele What þat he was, nor who it shulde be, He bad anoon vn-to his meyne, With-oute harme or any violence Fette anoon vn-to his presence Þe ?onge man whiche at þe gate stood, Þat hath þat day shad so moche blood. And whan he was a-forn Vlixes brou?t, Of hym he hath enquered oute &amp; sou?t, Firste of his kyn and nexte of his contre: “Certis,” quod he, “I was born in þe se, Amonge fysshes myd þe wawes grene,”— And seide also his moder was a quene Called Circes, of whom þe name is kouþe Boþe Est &amp; west, and ri?t fer be souþe, And tolde also his fader was a kyng, Þat hym begat at his home-comyng Fro Troye toun, toward his contre;— “And as my moder Circes tolde me Secrely, þat he Vlixes hi?te, Of wham desirous for to han a si?te, I entred am þis my?ti regioun, And haue pursuyd vn-to þis dongoun Only in hope my fader to haue seyn; But I se wel my labour is in veyn. And sith, in soth, loste is my traueyl, And þat it may on no side aveyle, It were foly lenger here to dwelle: Lo, here is al þat I can ?ou telle Of my kynred; axeth me no more.” With þat Vlixes gan to sy?e sore, For lak of blood, as he þat was ful pale, And seide anoon, whan he herde his tale: “Now wote I wel my woful destine Fulfilled is—it may noon oþer be!— Now wote I wel þat it is to late To grucche or strive ageyn my pitous fate; For my sone, as clerkes whylom tolde, Hath made an ende of my daies olde, Þer-on expectant, with peynes ful greuous!” And, with þat word, Thelagonyus, Whan he wist ageyn natures lawe Þat he, allas! hadde his fader slawe, Whiche in þat lond long[e] bar his crowne, With-oute abood he fil anoon a-swo[w]ne, His cloþes rent, his ?olwe here to-torn: “Allas!” quod he, “þat euere was I born! For cursid is my woful destine And my fortune, whiche I may nat fle! Cursid my sort, cursid myn auenture! And I, refus of euery creature, Forwaried eke my disposicioun, And cursid is my constellacioun— Cursed also and infortunat Þe hour in whiche my fader me [be]gat! So wolde God, with-oute lenger red, —Taquiten hym anoon—þat I were ded, To leie my lif for his deth to borwe!” And whan þe kyng sawe his gret[e] sorwe, And wist he was his sone of Circes born, By many signe rehersed here-to-forn, He vn-to hym anoon for-gaf his deth, As he my?t for want &amp; lak of breth, So importable was his passioun. And his sone ycalled Thelamoun, Whiche haþ in presoun so many day be shet, To his presence in al haste was fet; Whiche, whan he saw his fader in swiche point, Vp-on þe deth stondyng in disioint, And knewe also, &amp; þe trouþe [haþ] founde By whom he had his laste dedly wounde, A swerd he hent, &amp;, mortally Irous, And wolde haue ronne on Thelagonivs, Of hi?e dispit avenged for to be. But Vlixes of faderly pite Made his men hold hym &amp; restreyne; And amyd of al his greuous peyne, By his prudence—&amp; þat was don anoon— He made his sones for to be al oon; And gaf in charge vn-to Thelamoun, Of enternes and affeccioun, And of hool herte, feyned neuer-adel, Al his lyue to loue his broþer wel, To parte with hym tresour, gold, &amp; good, As to þe nexte born of al his blood. And þo, in soth, was no lenger taried, Þat Vlixes rially was caried Of Achaya to þe chefe cite; And after þat lyued daies þre, With-oute more, &amp; þo gaf vp þe gost. I can nat seyn, pleynly, to what cost, After þis lyf þat his soule is goon, But in a towmbe of metal &amp; of stoon Þe body was closed and yshet; And after þat maked was no let, Þat Thelamoun, with gret sollennite, I-crowned was in his fadres see, Swerd &amp; septer deliuered to his hond Of Achaya, a ful worþi lond, Ri?t abundaunt of tresour &amp; of good. And Thelagoun with hym þer abood A ?ere complet, wel cherisshed in his si?t, And of his broþer toke þe ordre of kny?t; And for hym list no lenger þer abide, Þe kyng for hym wysly gan prouide, Þat he with gold, gret tresour, &amp; plente Repeired is home to his contre; And his moder, of age wex[e] sad, Of [his] repeire passingly was glad, As she þat sawe be hir sorserie He skaped was many iupartie, Many pereil, &amp; many gret distresse. And after þat, she fil in-to seknesse, And hir dette ?alde vn-to nature, Whiche eskape may no creature In al þis world þat is here lyuyng. After whos deth hir sone was made kyng Of Aulydos, þe merueillous contre, As I haue tolde, enclosed with a see, Amonge rokkes, wher many shippes drowne; And sixti ?ere þer he bar his crowne, Þis manly man, [þis] Thelagonyus. And his brother, Thelamonyus, Regned also in his regioun Seuenti wynter, as made is mencioun. And after þat, þei made a royal ende, And boþe two to Iubiter þei wende, To regne þere among þe sterris bri?t. But now þe lanter and þe clere li?t Is wastid oute of Frigius Darete, Whilom of Troye wryter &amp; poete, Guyde haue I noon, forþe for to passe: For euene here in þe silf[e] place He ficched hath þe boundis of his stile, At þe sege he present al þe while, And ay in oon with hem dide abide— Dites þe Greke on þe toþer side. And boþe two as in her writyng Ne varie nat but in litel þing Touching mater, as in special, Þat is notable or historial: I do no fors of incidentes smale, Of whiche, in soth, it is but litel tale. Saue þis Dites maketh mencioun Of þe noumbre slay[e]n at þe toun Lastinge þe sege, affermyng, out of drede, Ey?te hundrid þousand &amp; sixe wer þer dede On Grekis side, vpri?t in þe felde; And as Dares also þere behelde, On Troye party in þe werre kene Six hundrid þousand seuenti &amp; sixtene Were slay[e]n þere—in Guydo ?e may se— With hem þat cam to help[e] þe cite Fro many coost &amp; many regioun, In diffence &amp; reskus of þe toun. And ful ten ?ere, so as I can caste, And sixe monþes þe my?ti sege laste, Or it was gete,—Dares writ hym silve— And, ouermore, complet dayes twelve Or Grekis hadde ful pocessioun, By fals engyn of þe Greke Synoun, Like as to-forn rehersid was but late.

And tyme complet of þis translacioun, By iust[e] rekenyng &amp; accountis clere, Was a þousand &amp; foure hundrid ?ere, And twenti ner,—I knowe it out of drede— After þat Crist resseyved oure manhede Of hir þat was Emperesse and quene Of heuene &amp; helle, and [a] maide clene— Þe ey?te ?ere, by computacioun, Suynge after þe coronacioun Of hym þat is most gracious in werkyng, Herry þe Fyfþe, þe noble worþi kyng And protector of Brutis Albyoun— And called is, þoru? his hi?e renoun, Þoru? his prowes &amp; his chiualrie, Also fer as passeþ clowde or skye, Of Normaundie þe my?ti conquerour: For þoru? his kny?thod &amp; diligent labour, Maugre alle þo þat list hym [to] with-seyn, He hath conquered his herytage ageyn, And by his my?ti prudent gouernaunce Recured eke his trewe title of Fraunce; Þat who-so liste loken and vnfolde Þe pe-de-Grew of cronycles olde, And cerchen bokes y-write longe a-forn, He shal fynde þat he is iustly born To regne in Fraunce by lyneal discent. And onward now he is made regent Of þilke lond durynge his fader lyf, Of his goodnes to voide werre &amp; stryf,— He to reioisshe, with-oute more delay, Septer &amp; crowne after þe kynges day, As it is clerly, in conclusioun, Enrolled vp in þe conuencioun. And þanne I hope þe tyme fortunat, Of þe olde worlde called aureat, Resorte shal, by influence of grace, Þat cruel Mars shal no more manace With his lokis furious and wood, By false aspectus for to shede blood A-twene þe folkes of þis rewmys tweyne, Whiche euery wy?t ou?t[e] to compleyne. But, as I trust in myn oppinioun, Þis worþi kyng of wisdam &amp; resoun And of kny?thod shal so doon his peyne To maken oon þat longe hath be tweyne: I mene þus, þat Yngelond and Fraunce May be al oon, with-oute variaunce, Oute of hertis old rancour to enchase By influence of his my?ti grace, Þat called is of clerkis, dout[e]les, Þe souereyn lord and þe prince of pes. And I hope his grace shal now reyne, To sette reste atwene þis rewmys tweyne: For in his power, sothly, stondeth al; And alliaunce of þe blod royal, Þat is knet vp by bonde of mariage, Of werre shal voide aweie þe rage, To make pes with bri?t[e] bemys shyne. And on þat is called Kateryne, And namyd is ri?t good &amp; faire also, Shal be mene a-twixe boþe two, Of grace enprentid in hir wommanhede, Þat to compleyne we shal haue no nede. And I hope hir gracious arryvaille In-to þis lond shal so moche availle, Þat Ioie, honour, and prosperite, With-oute trouble of al aduersite, Repeire shal, &amp; al hertly plesaunce, Plente, welfare, &amp; fulsom abundaunce, Pes &amp; quiete, boþe ny?e and ferre, With-oute strife, debat, or any werre, Meschef, pouert, nede, or indygence, With ful ceessyng of deth &amp; pestilence— Sothly, al þis I hope ?e shal sen Come in-to lond with þis noble quene, Þat we shal seyn of hert, &amp; feyne nou?t: Blessed be she þat al þis hath vs brou?t! —And he þat haþ þoru? my?t of his werkyng, Of his kny?thod concluded al þis þing, And swiche mervailles in armis don &amp; wrou?t, And his purpos fully aboute brou?t Of hi?e wisdam set in his inward si?t, Reioisshynge al þat longeth to his ri?t, And hi?est sit of worþinesse in glorie With þe scepter of conquest and victorie— I praie to God only for his beste, Whan he hath al set in pes and reste, And is ful put in clere pocessioun Of al þat longeth to his subieccioun, To sende hym home with as gret honour As euere ?it hadde any conquerour, Longe after, in Ioie and in quyete For to regnen in his royal sete! Þus shal I ay—þer is no more to seye— Day &amp; ny?t for his expleit y-preye Of feythful herte &amp; of hool entent, Þat whylom gaf me in commaundement, Nat ?ore a-go, in his faderes tyme, Þe sege of Troye on my maner to ryme, Moste for his sake, to speke in special. Al-þou? þat I be boistous and rual, He gaf me charge þis story to translate, Rude of konnynge, called Iohn Lydgate, Monke of Burie be professioun, Vsynge an habite of perfeccioun, Al-be my lyf acorde nat þer-to— I feyne nat; I wote wel it is so— It nedeth nat witnesse for to calle, Record I take of my brethren alle, Þat wil nat faille at so gret a nede. And al þat shal þis noble story rede I be-seche of support and of grace, Þer I offende in any maner place, Or wher-so-euere þat þei fynde errour, Of gentilnesse to shewe þis fauour: Benygnely for to done her peyne To correcte, raþer þan disdeyne. For wel wot I moche þing is wrong, Falsly metrid, boþe of short &amp; long; And, ?if þei shuld han of al disdeyn, It is no drede, my labour wer in veyn. Late ignoraunce &amp; rudnesse me excuse: For ?if þat ?e, platly, al refuse, For certeyn fautes whiche ?e shal fynde, I doute nat, my þank is set be-hynde; For in metring þou? þer be ignoraunce, ?et in þe story ?e may fynde plesaunce Touching substaunce of [þat] myn auctour wryt. And þou?e so be þat any word myssit, Amendeth it, with chere debonaire; For an errour to hyndren &amp; appaire, Þat is nat seide of purpos nor malys, It is no worshippe to hym þat is wys; And no wy?t gladly so sone ?eveþ [a] lak (Specialy be-hynden at þe bake), As he, in sothe, þat can no skyl at al— He goth ful hool þat neuer had[de] fal! And I nat fynde, of newe nor of olde, For to deme þer is noon so bolde, As he þat is blent with vnkonnyng: For blind Baiard cast pereil of no þing, Til he stumble myddes of þe lake! And noon so redy for to vndir-take Þan he, in soth, nor bolder to seie wers, Þat can no skyl on prose nor on vers; Of alle swiche þat can nat be stille, Litel forse, wher þei seie good or ille! For vn-to hem my boke is nat direct, But to swiche as hauen, in effect, On symple folke ful compassioun, Þat goodly can by correccioun Amende a þing, &amp; hindre neuere-adel, Of custom ay redy to seie wel: For he þat was gronde of wel-seying, In al hys lyf hyndred no makyng, My maister Chaucer, þat founde ful many spot— Hym liste nat pinche nor gruche at euery blot, Nor meue hym silf to parturbe his reste (I haue herde telle), but seide alweie þe best, Suffring goodly of his gentilnes Ful many þing enbracid with rudnes. And ?if I shal shortly hym discryve, Was neuer noon to þis day alyue, To rekne alle, boþe ?onge &amp; olde, Þat worþi was his ynkhorn for to holde. And in þis lond ?if þer any be, In borwe or toun, village or cite, Þat konnyng haþ his tracis for to swe, Wher he go brood or be shet in mwe— To hym I make a direccioun Of þis boke to han inspeccioun, Besechyng hem, with her prudent loke, To race &amp; skrape þoru?-oute al my boke, Voide &amp; adde wher hem semeth nede; And þou? so be þat þei nat ne rede In al þis boke no rethorikes newe, ?it I hope þei shal fynde trewe Þe story pleyn, chefly in substaunce. And who-so liste to se variaunce, Or worldly þing wrou?t be daies olde, In þis boke he may ful wel beholde Chaunge of Fortune, in hir cours mutable, Selde or nat feithful ouþer stable, Lordes, princes from her royalte Sodeinly brou?t in aduersite, And kynges eke plounged in pouert, And for drede darynge in desert,— Vnwar slau?ter compassed of envie, Mordre execut by conspirasie, Await[e] liggyng falshede and tresoun, And of kyngdammys sodeyn euersioun,— Rauysshyng of wommen for delyt, Rote of þe werre &amp; of mortal despit, Fals mayntenaunce of avout[e]rye, Many worþi causyng for to dye, Synne ay concludynge, who-so takeþ hede, Vengaunce vnwar for his final mede— To declare, þat in al worldly lust, Who loke ari?t, is but litel trust, As in þis boke exaumple ?e shal fynde, ?if þat ?e list enprente it in ?our mynde— How al passeth &amp; halt here no soiour, Wastyng a-way as doth a somer flour, Riche &amp; pore, of euery maner age: For oure lyf here is but a pilgrymage, Meynt with labour &amp; with moche wo, Þat ?if men wolde taken hede þer-to And to-forn prudently aduerte, Litel Ioie þei shuld han in her herte To sette her trust in any worldly þing; For þer is nouþer prince, lord, nor kyng, Be exaumple of Troye, like as ?e may se, Þat in þis lif may haue ful surete. Þerfore, to hym þat starf vppon þe rode, Suffringe deth for oure alder goode, Lyfte vp ?oure hertis &amp; þinke on him among: For be ?e neuere so my?ti nor so strong, With-oute hym al may nat availle; For he can ?if victorie in bataille And holde a felde, shortly to conclude, With a fewe ageyn gret multitude. And be grace he makeþ princes stronge, And worþi kynges for to regne longe, And tirauntis sodeynly oppresse, Þrowe hem doun, for al her gret richesse; And in his hond power he reserueth Eche man taquite liche as he disserueth— To whom I preie with deuocioun, With al myn herte &amp; hool affeccioun, Þat he list graunt longe contenuance, Prosperite, and good perseueraunce, Helþe, welfare, victorie, and honour Vn-to þat noble my?ti conquerour, Herry þe Fyfþe, to-forn y-specefied, So þat his name may be magnified Here in þis lyf vp to þe sterres clere, And afterward, aboue þe nynþe spere, Whan he is ded, for to han a place! Þis praie I God for to send hym grace, At whos biddynge, as I tolde late, First I be-gan þe sege to translate. And now I haue hooly in his honour Executed þe fyn of my labour. Vn-to alle þat shal þis story se, With humble herte and al humylite Þis litel boke lowly I be-take, It to supporte—and þus an ende I make. Explicit liber quintus et Vltimus. LENVOYE. Most worþi prince, of kny?thod sours &amp; welle, Whos hi?e renoun þoru? þe world doþ shine, And alle oþer in manhood dost excelle, Of merit egal to þe worþi nyne, And born also by discent of lyne As ri?tful eyr by title to atteyne, To bere a crowne of worþi rewmys tweyne! And also fer as Phebus in his spere From est to west shedeþ his bemys bri?t, And Lucyna, with a shrowdid chere, Goth compas rounde with hir pale li?t, Þou art [y-]rekned for þe best[e] kny?t, To be registred worþi as of name In þe hi?est place of þe hous of fame, To holde a palme of kny?thod in þin hond, For worþines and for hi?e victorie, As þou þat art drad on se &amp; lond, And euermore with laude, honour, &amp; glorie, For iust conquest to be put in memorie, With a crowne made of laurer grene Vp-on þin hed, to-fore þat famus quene— Whilom ordeyned only for conquerours, Stable of herte, with longe perseueraunce, And gaf nat vp til þei wer victours, Emprises take for no sodeyn chaunce, Whos name ay floureþ with newe remembraunce And fadeth nat of ?eris ?ore a-goon, Amonge whiche þou maist be set for oon: For þoru? þe world in euery regioun Reportid is with fame þat fleth wyde, Þat naturelly þi condicioun On þing be-gonne is kny?tly to abide, And for þe tyme manly sette a-side Reste and ese, what cost þer-on be spent, Til þou haue cheved þe fyn of þin entent. Most circumspect and passinge avysee, Al þi werkes conveied with prudence, Saad &amp; demvre, like to Iosue, Ageyn whos swerd is no resistence, And hast also heuenly influence, With Salomon, wysly to discerne, Only be grace þi peple to gouerne— Mercy eke meynt with þi magnificence, On alle oppressed for to haue pite, And of rebelles be manly violence Abate canst þe grete cruelte; And so with Dauid þou hast kyngly pite, And hi?e prowes with Sesar Iulius, In his tyme most victorius. And manly holdest in þin hondes two —Who can beholde by clere inspeccioun— Þe swerd of kny?thod &amp; þe scepter also: The ton to bring to subieccioun Hertes made proude by fals rebellioun, And with þe scepter to rewle at þe beste Þi pore liges, þat wolde live at reste. Now, þou þat haste manhod, vertu, &amp; grace, Attemperaunce, fredam, &amp; bounte, Lowly I praie, with a dredful face, Disdeyne nat benyng[e]ly to se Vp-on þis boke rudly made by me, To fyn only to agreen þin hi?nesse— And rewe of merci vp-on my symplesse, And [eke] in þi kny?tly aduertence Considre &amp; se, my souereyn lord most dere, Of þi Innat famous sapience, Þat Crist Iesus received with good chere Þe twey Mynutes ?oue of herte entere By þe wydowe, whiche of wille &amp; þou?t Gaf al hir good, &amp; kepte hir silf ri?t nou?t. By whiche ensample, so þat it nat offende Þoru? myn vnkonnynge to þin hi?e noblesse, Late good wil my litel gift amende, And of þi mercy &amp; renomed goodnesse Haue no disdeyn of my bareyn rudnesse, And, in makyng þou? I haue no mvse, Late trewe menyng þe surplus [al] excuse. More þan good hert hath no maner wy?t To presente nouþer to God nor man, And for my part to þe, as it is ri?t, Þat gyf I hool as ferforþe as I can, Ay to perseuere, fro tyme þat I gan, With wil &amp; þou?t for þin estate to preie, Whiche to conserue, þus finally I seie: First of al, Almy?ti God to queme With al þat may be to his plesaunce, And to þi crowne and þi diademe Grace &amp; good eure with long continuaunce, Of þi liges feithful obeisaunce, And eche vertu þat man may specefie, I praye God graunte vn-to þi regalye! Verba translatoris ad librum suum. Go, litel bok, &amp; put þe in þe grace Of hym þat is most of excellence; And be nat hardy to apperen in no place With-oute support of his magnificence: And who-so-euere in þe fynde offence, Be nat to bold for no presumpcioun— Þi silfe enarme ay in pacience, And þe submitte to her correccioun. And for þou art enlumined with no floures Of rethorik, but with white &amp; blak, Þerfore þou most abide alle showres Of hem þat list sette on þe a lak; And whan þou art most likly go to wrak, Ageyn[e]s hem þin errour nat diffende, But humblely with-drawe &amp; go a-bak, Requerynge hem al þat is mys to amende.
