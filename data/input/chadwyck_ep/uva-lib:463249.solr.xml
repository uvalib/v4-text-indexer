      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, his very good Frende M. RICHARD MAISTERS Doctor in Phisick, and Seruant to her excellent Maiestie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Ouerthrowe of the GOVTE. Against the Goute w? al her force my minde desires to goe: And w? a valiaunt hand to fling, my darts at this my foe. Longe time this beast hath now presumed, her wicked force to bend: Against that good olde man that doth, the Sedun flock defend, Diseased sore he lies and able, not to stirre a limme: So hath the wretche benomd his Ioints and so hath plagued him. That still he is inforste to keep his house, as doth the Snaill: O pitious hap and great mischaunce, that each man ought to waill. It greeues me to the hart to se, the torments that he beares: Her crueltie Constrayneth me, to staine my cheekes with teares My sorowes doth c?maund y? doutfull hap of Mars to trye: Why stand I stil? I will assayle, the monster presentlye. Drawe neere O sweet Redeemer of, the World before vndoone: Of that moste glorious maiestie, the true and only sonne. Uouchsafe to giue thy speeding darts, in this my quarrel iust: And cause that I with them may throwe this monster in the dust. And thou O noble Phillip, by all the Gods abooue that be: I thee require to showe thy self, a man in eche degree. Hope wel for hope auaileth much, In driuing greef away: I dout no whit, but shortly thou shalt see a fairer day. More hapeneth in an houre somtime, then in a thousand yeer: And many great commodities, in smallest time appeer. I trust to driue the Gout vnto the lothsome pit of hel: And that thou shalt good Phillip haue thy feet again ful wel. Doo you no more but bear in minde, the woords that I shall say: And these my lessons that I giue, doo cary wel away. The suttle shackles that this Beast, dooth binde the feet withall: Podagran all the learnd of Greece, haue euer vsde to call. Hence sprang at first the hateful name, of this so painful greef: That suddainly the feet vnwares, assaileth like a theef. At first it rageth in the ioynts, and then assaults the toes: And straight from thence with hastie course vnto the heel it goes. And somtimes to the buckle bones, where as it swelles and showes: With pain while as abundance great, of humors thether flowes. Somtime the Cod beside, that bothe the stones incloseth round: Dooth swel withall and hanging lowe, it oftentimes is found. The causer of this great disease, not euermore is one: Oft times the parents are the cause it falles the Childe vpon. When as the seed but feeble is, wherof the frute is wrought: For since the root such weakenes hath, the plant must needs be nought. Besides to vehement exercise, the Gout dooth often breed: Of seruice long in Venus court, it likewise dooth proceed. The very frame of all the limmes, is shaken with this game: Eche Sinow eke enfeebled is by vsing of the same. And Bacchus thou that wunted art, the spirits to reuiue: Doost vse to hurt the feet of such, as in thy seruice striue. Of Martiall acts in stately stile, did Ennius alwaies write: And in his cups did blase the deeds, of many a worthy knight. Yet of the Gout at last he dyed, nor could his verses saue: (With all the sweetnes that they had) their maister from the graue. Great hurt beside vnto the ioynts, dooth euermore arise: Of colde, excessiue Idlenes, and to much exercise. The hart with fury once inflamde, dooth kindle presently: And fireth all the humors straight, that in the body lye. Wherby vnbrideled all, they rome and raunge in euery place: And paining all the Senous sore, they vex in pitious case. Oft times of thick and clammy fleume, this vile disease dooth breed: Somtime again, of bothe the sortes of Choler dooth proceed. And tomuch blood while as it dooth, the tender ioynts oppresse: Is many times the onely cause, of this vnquietnes. Moste greeu'd with this disease are men, the women not so much: The cause is plain and euident, who listeth it to touch. One reason is because that heat, in man dooth more exceede: Which causeth that the humors pearse, the senowes more with speed. Moste subiect to the gout are those, that greatest age haue seene: And such as with some sicknes great, haue long tormented beene. And cares of minde and sorowes great, doo breed this greeuous sore: And want of wunted exercise, as hath been said before. Let this suffise to showe the spring, of such a hellish sprite: Now time it is my weapons for, to showe and fall to fight. And first I wil begin with herb, with Iuyce and mettals bright: And then of stones that serue the turn, I craue the aid and might. Then Beasts and Birds I set in rank, and cause them to restore: The weake and wearish limmes of those that lamed were before. And last of all my Tables doo I spred with meat and Wine: And there the perfect diat for this sicknes doo assigne. Not our common Toutsane but Dioscorides his Panacæa reed Mathiolus.First Toutsane vnto thee I giue, the cheefest place before: That doost deriue thy worthy name, of healing euery sore. Thou beaten small and mingled wel with reasons good and sweet: In plaister made applyed wel, doost heal the feeble feet. Mary Goldes.An herb there is that in the Sun, dooth woundrously delight: And after him dooth euermore, direct her course aright. That when he once begins to rise, dooth spred and open wide: And mourning hangeth down her hed, when Westwards he dooth slide. This medled wel with sewet of a Gote, dooth driue away. The Gout, the like dooth Balme stamped if to the feet you lay. And Ueruen sod in water dooth the feet from sicknes saue: Which herb the noble Romans wont in great account to haue. The alter fair of Iupiter, with this they vsde to sweep: And therwith euery corner of their houses sprinkled deep. Beside the Herald when he gaue, defiance to his foe: Commaunded was with Garland all of Ueruen clad to go. Coleworts in this disease are good, beeing sodden specially: The broth wherof refuse not thou, to drink for remedy. Put Coliander to the Cole, and Salt and Rewe beside: And flower fine of Barley that, by grinding small is tride, A Pultise made of these, if to the aking ioynts ye lay: It greatly dooth the paines asswage, and driues the Gout away. And if the Gout be such as in his rage it dooth not swel: The Radish root wil help, if that in Wine you seeth it wel. The noble Radish that our fathers olde, did greatly looue: And did indeed the same esteeme, all other meats abooue. At Delphus was it then decreed, it should be grau'd in Golde: The Beet in siluer to be framde, the Raape in leaden moulde. This to the Gout is to be laid, the Iuce of Woodbinde thick: And mingle therewithall the meal or Flower of Fenugrick. And Nettel rootes wel brused in the strongest Uinager: The leaf &amp; the seede with Beres greace.The leaues beside beeing pouned with the tallowe of a Bear. And stinking Assa fætida, in spunges wel applyde: Wil likewise help the greeuous Gout, and Feuer sore beside. If therunto you put the Wax, that is from Cipresse brought: And see that with the suet of a Gote it wel be wrought. Plantain beeing pouned wel with salt, and Lens with Polent good: The water Betany, besides Pap made with Barly. Hemp roots, and Sothernwood. The Iuyce of Henbane mixt with meal, that from the Mil dooth flye: And wax, with Gum Armoniack in equall quantitie. And boyled wel in Uinagre. the braunche of Poplar small: With Herb that beares his name of Age, that Grounsil we doo call. To this it needful is to put, the greace of fatted Bore: And mingle wax with Willowe leaues, that wel haue sod before. An Herb there is that in the Sea, Phicus marina Sea weed. dooth alwaies winde about: Which (if it be not ouer dry) wil heale the painful Gout. Who would beleeue that heaps of Corne, should driue the Gout away, And bring the feeble foot his force, to stand without a stay? As Sextus searching of the Barnes, Sextus Pompeius was taken with the Gout: He laid him down in heaps of Wheat, that closde him rownd about. When suddainly he felt him self, aswel as any man: And rysing vp with ioyful hart, to walke about began. For all the humor out was drawen, and dryed by this releef: That was the hed, the fountain and the cause of all this greef. For such a force is in the Wheat, as that it hath been seen: The vessels ful in shortest time, to drawe and dry vp clene To Elder leaues. the Sewet of a Gote put orderly: This laid vnto the feet wil be a present remedy. Houseleek or Singre.Forget not that same herb beside that green dooth alwaies growe: It healeth those same angry Gouts, that red and fiery showe. The Gourd that groweth wilde his rine, is thought to doo the same: Which also helps the hed that dooth with fiery humors flame. The wylde Cocumber.The like beeing sod in Uinagre the Cocumber wil doo: So wil the Cole, the surging Seas that groweth neer vnto. Sea Colwort it groweth vnder the Clyfts besydes Seaforde in Sussex And Purslain pounded wel with Salt, dooth heale this painful rage: And likewise dooth the fiery heat of shingles soon assawge. Tis very straunge that rust of Iron, wil heale the greeuous Gout: The wound beside with Lancel made, wil let the poyson out. When Telephus with staf of fierce Achilles wounded was: And neuer a Surgion there aboute: could bring the cure to passe. They took aduisement of their Gods, Apollo answered thus: Achilles Swoord (quoth he) shall saue, the life of Telaphus. With ioyful mind went Telephus, to meet his enemy: Who striking gaue him with his wound, a present remedy. The treacle good beside, that cures the deadly poyson strong: Is souerain to be vsde against the Gout retained long. What should I heer of Salt intreate Nature that all things spun: Created nothing needful more for man then Salt and sun. With salt we sauour all our meat, and doo preserue our food: Take Salt away our bankets lost, no Uiands seemeth good. A Bag of Salt beat? smal wet in boyling wine and layd to the feet. Or salt very fine beaten with Oyl of Camomil made in an Ointment.Salt maketh strong and lustie Ioynts, example good may be: The tough and sturdy limmes of horne, in Fishers that we see. Salt with his fretting force, dooth enter, pearce and thorow spring: Dissolueth, eateth, burneth vp and fineth euery thing. With Hony, Oile, and meal beeing mixt and beaten as it ought: It maketh good the feet again, that feeble were and nought. And if you list my poore aduise, in this disease to take: Go get you to the Sea and bathe, your feet when they doo ake. Tis good in Brimstone bathes somtime to wash your self beside: Which wil refresh your crased limmes, and stop a stormy tide. Take water with Salt Peeter mixt and Brimstone, let them boil: And wash your legges, or if you list, with Lees of sodden Oyle. And now for stones, let three suffise, the Iet as one of those: From whence a stinking sulphur aire, ascendeth to the nose. The smel wherof doo Serpents shun, wher with what soeuer you write: In brittel vessel made of Earth, wil neuer out of sight. Lay this vnto your Gout, the stone that Iron vp dooth take: Dooth tame this mad vnruly beast, and quickly out dooth shake. Beat small a Medstone, mix it with the Milk of such a wight: As at her first deliuery brings a pretie Boy to light. This wil asswage the Gout, if that you lay it therunto: And bring the Senowes to their force, to doo as they should doo. You worthy creatures that haue life, with haste your selues addresse, And let me haue your helping hands, in this my busines. The bones of man to ashes burnt, and made in pouder fine: Beeing drunk, is not of littie force, against this foe of mine. And womans milk, if that you ioyne the Humlock therwithall: Applyed to the feet dooth heale, the raging torments all. Put Goosegrece heerunto and ad green Isop to the same: Opium the Iuyce or Gum of black Poppey.Or Opium wherwithall you may, a parfect medicine frame. With grece of swine, ioyne womans heare and this shall doo you good: Beeing laid vnto the aking feet, that rage with angry mood. Refuse not thou to bath thy feet, with Urin of a man: Prouided that the party be, as helthy as ye can. The right foot of an Egle, to your right foot look you lay: And to your left leg lay the left, to driue the gout away. Somtime again with Horseleaches, beset your feet about: That Blood suckers are termed of the rude and common rout. These neuer wil forsake the legges, wherto they cleaue and pul: (So great desire they haue to blood) til all their skin be ful. But all the vilest humors that, they in those partes doo finde: Which were the causers of this greef, they drink with greedy minde. And when they once haue fild them selues, as ful as they may be: They leaue the place and fall away, as beasts that drunken be. But if they chaunce to cleue to fast, and wil not leaue their holde, Then sprinkle beaten Salt theron burnt wul or ashes colde. It holsom is beside to open in thy feet some bleeding vain: Wherby the humor passeth out, that breedeth all thy pain. An aged Cock wel stewed in broth, beeing drunk dooth pleasure great: In filling all the ioints aud limmes with sweet and plesant heat. The milk of Asses drunck dooth heale, the gout with raging mood: So dooth the flesh therof if that, you vse it for your food. The Owle that hath a body fat, you seeth in water shall: And often eat the tender flesh and drink the broth withall. The Grece of Swine, with Ashes mixt of dung that Gotes doo make: Gotes d?g mingled with Barly flower and Uinagre, a good Pultis. So is the root of marsh malowes mingled with Ducks greace, for olde swelling goutesIs very souerain, if therwith you noynt the feet that ake. O worthy Greace of Swine that doost, deserue so great a praise: What good vnto the ioynts of man, thou bringest sundry waies. When as the limmes and members all, with colde congealed be: Their naturall heat again, and warmth they straight receiue from thee. Thou supplest stifned partes and such as weake and feebled be: Restorste to helth and sores doost heale that lothsome are to see. Thou driu'st the Gout from hand and foot, what should I vtter more? In few woords wil I speake at once, thou healest euery sore. Such force to thee the helthful roots, of noble herbes doo giue: Wherwith the wandring herds of Swine in pleasant pastures liue. The Romains, that by valure all the world did once subdue: Had thee in honor great for this, thy vertues that they knew. With thee the gladsome Bride, when as the house she enter should Of her new maried mate, the posts and thresholdes couer would. Heerof the wife first took her name, because in times before: The charge to her committed was of noynting of the doore. For they supposde this Grease would put all troubles vnto flight: And that for euer after, no misfortune enter might. But to my Gout again, The Dung of Kites and ashes fine: Of Snailes and Wesel burned bothe wil heale this Gout of thine. Let Legges that thus diseased be, be bath'd with Wesels blood: The Sewet likewise of a Calf, for this is very good: To this may also added be, the flesh of fearful Deer: And there withall the Broth wherin, A Fox fleaed cut in small Gobbits destilled w? Oile of Camomil, Oile of Rew, oile of wormes, of eche [illeg.]. ounces, a quantitie of Aqua vite. A good water to noint the ioynts. the Hare hath boyled cleere. With case of craftie Fox let all thy foot wel wrapped be: And for to noint them with the Greace, of Reynard helpeth thee. And good it is in skinnes of Dogs, to keep and wrap them wel: And with the greace of them to noint, the painful feet that swel. Moreouer take a Crowe and quick put him in Horsedung deep: And close him so that he may haue, no place away to creep. When foure dayes once be ful expirde, go take him from his graue: And burn him straight, then mingle Wax with the Ashes that you haue. This laid vnto the feet, dooth driue this monster quite away: And makes the poore diseased man, to go without a stay. And Iunoes bird, the Peocock helps if that his dung you take: And plaister wise apply it to, the lamed limmes that ake. Annoint thy feet with drippings hot of greasy rosted Cat: And take the Beauers stones beside, and mingle wel with that. To Ashes burn the Mullets hed, that in the sea dooth swim: With pleasant Honye mingle it, and noint thy crased lim. Go take the crauking Frog, and with thy knife, go quarter out His members all, and lay his feet vnto the painful Gout. So that the right doo touch the right and that the left doo lye: Upon the left, so shalt thou finde a present remedy But leauing now these creatures heer, though many more there be: Of like effect, for who can write of all in eche degree? I wil thee straight wayes showe how thou, thy table shalt prepare: And in what sorte for thine auail, thou shalt appoint thy fare. Great Gluttony and surfetting, the limmes dooth quickly lame: And therefore would I soberly, thy diet thou shouldst frame. First see thy bread be baked wel, that thou at Table hast: And neither black nor yet to white, but pleasant in the taste. All trifles banish from thy boord, and meal with honye made: As Custards, Pyes and Florentines, and other of this trade. All Salt and slimy meats, and flesh that long dooth poudred lye: And fish in Salt preserude, all such I warne thee for to flye. Bothe Garlick, Rue and Onions soure expel them far from thee: Although the fond Egiptians doo: suppose them Gods to be. Abstain from Pepper, Raapes &amp; Grapes that in the spring time be: From Apples, Peares, and such like frute as winter giueth thee. Nor suffer thou the deadly Beanes to come vpon thy boords Which once the wise Pithagoras condemned by his woord. With this the holy Preests durst neuer deale in all their rites: It longeth vnto Goblins and to black and fearful sprights. It dooth the sence and wit of man, bothe dul and dampish make: And rayseth in the night such dreames, as makes the hart to quake. Bothe Peason, Nuts and Chesnuts grose despise thou in this case: And take thou heed that at thy boord, no Cheese haue any place. Let these suffise for food, the Hen and Chanticlere the bolde: The Wether and the lustie Steere, who neuer yet was colde. The Cunny, Hare, the Partridge, and the Egge thats rosted rere: And all the smallest Birds beside that tender limmes doo beare. Such Fishes small I like, as in the running Riuers fleet: And such as haue no scales, for to refuse I think it meet. The Lamperns shun, that licking of the rock was wunt to lye: And therwithall the Crab that sidling seekes her self to wry. Let not the Eele thy Table touch, a clamy humor stil: Dooth from this fish proceed, that all the ioints of man dooth fil. The Lamprey long agone was had, in estimation great: And taken for his daintie taste, to be a Princes meat. Antonia (Drusus wife) was wunt, the Lamprey for to feed: And set her out with rings of golde, the farther to exceed: A Lampry dead Hortensius did bewaile with many a teare: Such was the fauour of the great goodwil that he did beare. But medle not with it whosoeuer thou art that hast the gout: For why, it dooth increase thy paines, and brings thy greef about. In fewe woords for to make an end, For who can all things touch: In this disease much helthsomer is flesh, then fish by much. Take for your drink the mildest wine, and cleerest you can get: And mingle it with water wel, the fume away to fet. What quantitie you ought to drink, I need not heer define: Your own discretion heerin best, a measure may assigne. But this I onely warn you of, that when you leaue your meat: You leaue with some desire to drink, and some desire to eat. Then feed on Coliander seeds, when thus you wel haue fed: To make a mery hart and keep the vapours from the hed. Giue not thy self to too much sleep, nor watch not all the night: And let some distance be betwixt, thy sleepe and supper light. Lye not vpon the back for this is for the body nought: But very seldome vse to ride, take neuer any thought. Somtime it shall be good awhile, to passe the time away: To hear the pleasant instrument, of such as wel can play. Nothing then Musick, more our greef and sorowes banish can: It glads the minde, and mery minde dooth make a helthy man. Far from thee look thou euer haue all grim and sollemne Syers. All louring lumpish lookes that lothe, bequeath them to the Fryers. Make choyse of such companions, as be wise and sweet withall: Whose talke delightful is to hear, and voide of any gall. Whose grauitie is poudred with, an honest pleasant minde: Not tedious to the hearer, nor vain waster of his winde. Take such into thy company, eschue the fleering mate: The flatterer, and such as where they come doo sowe debate. Use alwaes holsome exercise, thy feet to walke assay: This exercise consumes and wastes the humors il away. For long and slothful Idlenes, decayes the members all: And dooth disgrace the body quite, And causeth it to fall. And like as Iron rusteth straight, with lothsome Canker vile: If that you suffer it to rest and vse it not a while. So are our bodyes straight defilde, and vnto mischeef fall: If that we let them idle be, and woork them not at all. Beside a pitious sight it is, a lamentable case: To see the King of Creatures all lye lame and not haue grace. Nor wil to exercise him self, but Idle stil to bee: And through his owne great fault &amp; blame, to want his libertie. By little and little try thy strength, with certain rule and rate: Which force with labour wil increase, so it be moderate. Auoid the aire that flameth stil, with ouerscorching heat: And that which ouercolde the members all dooth il intreat. If these my rules you doo obserue I trust you soon shall see: This cruel raging Gout, as she deserues destroyd to bee. Inough now haue we tryed the feelde, the Trumpet bids retire: Heer stands the bownds of mine exployt and end of my desire. Soli Deo honor et Gloria. FINIS. A Dialogue betwixt the Gout and Cri. Balista. Gout. Alas poor wretch alas, which way now shall I turn my sight: whil as so great a storme of darts doo ful vpon me light? O haplesse wretch whome lewd aspects, of hateful starres haue torne: Accursed be the lothsome day: that euer I was borne. All pearst with darts I am and knowe not how my self to saue: My ioynts are all benummed so, and neuer a foot I haue: What fauour more hath nature showed, to beasts then vnto me: That hath ordained them a meane to keep their libertie? Oft times the Stag dooth laugh to scorne the Hunter and his Hound: The Bore dooth laugh and euery beast, that in the woods are found. And why? for trusting to their feet they scape the dangers all: Good feet dooth many times preuent, great mischeefs that would fall. But I alas more slowly mooue, then any Tortoise great: And lame and feeble as I lye, the darts vpon me beat. What now remaines? but that to hel pale death me down dooth cast: And make an end of this my life, that may no longer last. Alas and shall I dye? B. Thou shalt. G. Wh?e doo I hear? B. Me. G. Whom? B. Thy greatest fo. G. What is thy name? what Region camst thou from? B. My name Balista is. G. Why doost thou shoot thy shaftes at me? B. To make thee dye. G. I not deserue so great extremitie. B. A thousand Gallowses thou dost, a thousand Fires with all: A thusand racks, a thousand wheeles, and after death dooth fall. A thousand Helles thon doost deserue, I haue not long to tel: The sundry sortes of torments that thou hast deserued wel. G. Tel me the cause. B. The cause is this that men of worthy fame: Thou with thy mischeeuous disease, hast plagued and stricken lame. G. Wh? haue I plagued? B. Wh?e? it were to much for me to tel: Alas I am not able for to stay from weeping wel. Besides a number that thou wretched beast, hast lamed quite: While in tormenting of their ioynts, thou shewds thy cruel spite. The good Sedunian Bishop thou haste caused down to fall: And ouercome, doost keep him yet in prison, as thy thrall. Whose worthy life dooth glister like, the Sun with blasing beames: Him hast thou in thy shackles shut, and tyed vp in thy teames. And therfore dye y? shalt. G. For pittie yet showe fauour vnto me: B. That can I not. G. Thou art no steele, B. I wil be vnto thee. G. O spare me yet I thee beseeche, thy Philip shall be free: And wel shall haue his helth again, and walke at libertie. B. I more dema?d. G. Whats that? B. That thou foule beast, doo neuer tuch: The limmes of any vertuous man, nor trouble any such. G. To this I graunt. B. I warne thee look, thou keepe thy promesse wel: Thy members els asunder wil, I teare and send to hel. G. Whome wilt thou licence me, with shackels sharp to take and binde? B. For that these words that I shall say to thee lay vp in minde. First set thy shackels vpon such, as alwaies fight and brall: And murther on an other stil, for euery trifle small. Whose feet are euer forward, for to rome vnto the swoord: Contrary to the sweet decree, of Christe our sauiours woord. G. But may I be so bolde to touch, the feet of mightie Kings? B. Yea hardly for thence the root, of all this mischeef springs. what Region can you finde where Mars, his Banner hath not spred? What Cuntrie now that is not with the blood of Christians red? For what so euer the ambitious mindes, of Princes foorth dooth bring: Tis we poore soules that feele the smart, tis we that only wring. Go fetter thou their feet with bolts, that neuer wil away: Except they ceasse their madnesse soone, and from their follyes stay. G. And whome besides shall I attempt? B. The burston bellyed lout: To him that scarce for fat can beare, his lothsome guts about. G. I neuer medle with the paunch, B. The paunches such I call: As feed them selues vntil they be, as fat as Oxe in stall. And nether feed with word nor life, the sheep they ought to serue: But slothful beasts doo leaue their flock for hunger like to sterue. G. And shall I touch no more but these? B. Yes, such as vse to sweare: Whore hunters, theeues and surfetters, their ioynts in sunder teare. And for auoyding many woords, I thus conclude with thee: Forbeare the vertuous and the good, plague those that wicked be. FINIS.</field>
