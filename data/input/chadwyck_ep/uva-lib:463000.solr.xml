The Prologe of .J. T. in the honour &amp; laude of saint Werburge / and to the prayse of √æ? translatour of the legende folowynge. 1 Honour / ioye / and glorie / the toynes organicall, Endeles myrthes w? melodies! / prayse ye all y? princes, Nourisshed in vertue / intact / as pure as cristall, Relefe to all synners! / o Werburge, lady maistres; In grace thou passed / all other, and in goodnes, Whan thou was present in this mundayne lyfe; None was the lyke / wydowe / mayde / ne wyfe. 2 By diuyne grace / to vs a ryche present, Reioyce we may / in Werburge one and all, A gemme of vertue / a virgin resplendent, Dilect of our lorde (in ioye and blis eternall Surely she is set) to intercede and call, Her mouth nat cessyng / for them to call and crye And in her trust / of synne to haue mercy. 3 O good lady maistres / declyne thy syght a-fer And graciously beholde / thy seruaunt chast and pure, Henry Bradsha / sometyme monke in Chester, Whiche only for thy loue / toke the payne and laboure Thy legende to translate‚Äî / he dyd his busy cure, Out of latine / in Englisshe rude and vyle, Whiche he hath amended / with many an ornate style. 4 Alas, of Chestre / ye monkes haue lost a treasure, Henry Bradsha / the styrpe of eloquence! Chestre, thou may wayle / the deth of this floure; So may the cite?ens / alas! for his absence, So may many other / for lacke of his sentence. O swete lady Werburge / an holy Abbasse glorious, Remembre Henry Bradsha / thy seruaunt most gracious. 5 In hym remayned no vice ne presumpcion, Enuy and wrath / from hym were exyled, Slouth ne Venus in hym had no dominion, Auarice and glotony / he vtterly expelled; No vice in hym regned / his felowes he excelled. As clene as cristall / he bare these vertues thre: Chastite / obidience / and wylfull pouerte. 6 O cruell deth / whiche art the perfite ende Of this noble clerke / and euery mortall thyng, Agaynst the / no man may hym defende; Thou causest wo / languor / and anguissyng. And who on this / wolde haue remembryng Howe from erth / to erth he must agayne, He wolde dispise all thynges that be mundayne. Vale. Here foloweth the lyfe of the gloryous virgyn saynt werburge / also many miracles that god hath shewed for her. / &amp; fyrst the prologe of the auctour. [Whan Phebus had ronne his cours in sagittari] [BOOK I.] The prologe of the translatour of this lytell werke, √æ? lyfe of saynt Werburge. [Ca. i.] 1 Whan Phebus had ronne his cours in sagittari And Capricorne entred, a sygne retrograt, Amyddes Decembre / √æ? ayre colde &amp; frosty, And pale Lucyna / the erthe dyd illumynat, I rose vp shortly / fro my cubycle preparat, Aboute mydnyght / and cast in myne intent How I myght spende / the tyme conuenyent. 2 I called vnto mynde / the great vnstedfastnes Of this wretched worlde‚Äî / not by cours of nature‚Äî How there be brought / some men to busynes, Oppressed with pouerte / langour / and dyspleasure, Some other exalted / to felycyte and pleasure. The maker of mankynde / most in maieste, Ruleth all at his wyll / it may non other be. 3 Beholde dyscretly / and se the fyrmament, Consyder the sonne / and the mone also, With all the planettes / and sterres resplendent, How they kepe theyr cours / bothe to and fro, Euer obedyent / theyr creature vnto; And byrdes besely / syngynge euery day, Praysynge theyr prymate all that they may; 4 The .iii. elementes / in lyke condycyon, The fyre / the water / the ayre / and the londe, Obseruen theyr duty / after theyr creacyon And buxum ben / and euer so be fonde. Thus euery creature / as we vnderstonde, Obeyeth to his creature / with humylyte‚Äî Except dyssolute man / folowyng sensualyte; 5 If man wyll remembre / how he was create To the lykenes and figure / of god almyghty, And set in paradyse / a place moost delycate, To haue the fruycyon / of eternall glory / If not synne expulsed hym / to the vale of mysery, But that he wolde enclyne / his naturall reason To serue his maker / truely at due season. 6 Dyuers people / haue dyuers condicions: Comynly proued / it is euery day: Some set to vertu / and good disposycyons, In penaunce / prayer / all that they may, Some in contemplacyon / the sothe to say, Some in abstynence / to chastyce the body And make it subget / to the soule perfytely; 7 Some other reioyce / in synne and ydelnes, Some seruauntes to Venus / both day and nyght, Other to couetyse / and worldly besynes, Some to deceyue / by subtylte in syght, Some vnto marchandyse / &amp; wynnynge full ryght, Some ferefull and tymerous / without audacyte, Some sadde and sobre / and of great grauyte; 8 Many haue pleasure to speke of rybaudry, Some of fyghtynge / braulynge / and actes marcyall, Other to flater / and paynt the company, Some to syt bytwene the cuppe and the wall, Some to blaspheme / and dyssemble withall, To backbyte and sclaunder / by malyce and enuy, Some to extorcyon / thefte and playne robry. 9 Thus after fraylte / and sundry compleccyons Dyuers men dyuers in lyuynge there be, Dysposed by a contrary dysposycyon, Some vnto vertue / some vnto vanyte; Many maners of people / now we may se Wauerynge in the worlde / without quyetnes, As a shyp by tempest / is dryuen, doubtles. 10 Whan I reuolued / with due circumstaunce The dyuers maners / and mutabylyte Of worldly people / and the great varyaunce, And how this lyfe / is of no suerte, Now in great langour / now in prosperyte; yet after our meryte / we shalbe sure To be rewarded / at our departure: 11 Than to vertuous labours / we shulde apply And spende not our tyme / all in ydlenes; For, as a byrde is made / by nature to fly, Ryght so we shulde vse / some good busynes To our soule-helthe / with great mekenes; For tyme euyl spende / in labours vayne Is harde to be well / recouered agayne. 12 But now, syth I am / a relygyous man, For losynge of tyme / can not me excuse, Therfore I purpose / to do as I can: All suche ydlenes / whylom to refuse, With the grace of god / the tyme for to vse Some small treatyse / to wryte breuely To the comyn vulgares / theyr mynde to satysfy. 13 To descrybe hye hystoryes / I dare not be so bolde, Syth it is a mater / for clerkes conuenyent, As of the .vii. aeges / and of our parentes olde, Or of the .iiii. empyres / whylom moost excellent; Knowynge my lernynge / therto insuffycyent. As for bawdy balades / ye shall haue none of me, To excyte lyght hertes / to pleasure and vanyte. 14 But now in auoydynge / suche great folysshenes I purpose to wryte / a legende good and true And translate a lyfe / into Englysshe doubtles; I meane the spouse / of our lorde Ihesu, Blessed saynt Werburge / replete with vertue, A noble prynces borne / &amp; vyrgyne pure and gloryous, After an holy monyall / and an abbesse gracyous. 15 In the abbay of Chestre / she is shryned rychely, Pryores and lady / of that holy place, The chyef protectryce / of the sayd monastery Longe before the conquest / by deuyne grace; Protectryce of the Cytee / she is and euer was, Called specyall prymate / and pryncypall presydent, There rulynge vnder / our lorde omnypotent. 16 And yf I vnworthy / begynne this lytell werke, I praye all the reders / mekely of pardon, To correcke and amende / syth I am no clerke, Excuse my ignoraunce / and take the entencyon. My mynde is to shewe / her lyfe and deuocyon, That euery man and woman / ensample maye take At this pure vyrgyn / synne to forsake. 17 And syth that she is / in blysse now gloryfyed, It were no reason / her name be had in scylence, But to the people / her name be magnyfyed, To her laude and prayse / honour and reuerence. Her parentes and bretherne / √æ? floures of experyence, Haue ben kepte in close / secrete many a day: Wherfore I purpose / somwhat of them to say. 18 Fyrst I entende / to make playne descrypcyon Of her fathers kyngedome / the realme of Mercyens, How longe it endured / vnder his tuycyon, Vnder how many kynges / it had prehemynens; Also of her petygre / the noble excellence‚Äî For so many sayntes / of one kynred, certayne, Is harde to be founde / in all the worlde agayne. 19 Vnto this rude werke / myne auctours these shalbe: Fyrst the true legende / and the venerable Bede, Mayster Alfrydus / and Wyllyam Maluysburye, Gyrarde / Polycronycon / and other mo in deed. Now gloryous god / graunt me to procede; Blessed vyrgyn Werburge / my holy patronesse, Helpe me to endyte / I praye the, swete maystresse. A descrypcyon of the realme of Mercyens / of bondes and commodytes of the same. [Ca. ii] 20 The yere of our sauyoure / by full computacyon Foure hundred / nyne &amp; fourty frome his natiuite, As venerable Bede / maketh declaracyon, Duke Hengyst came to this lande in great royalte With Saxons / Angles / Iutes / thre people myghtye; Desyred by Vortyger / than kynge of Brytons, Came to defende [him] / fro greuous oppressyons. 21 Also the yeres of our blessed sauyoure Syxe hundreth foure score and nyne expresse The Brytons were expulsed / so sayth mync auctoure, From Englande to walles / with great wretchydnes. In Englande than ruled / seuen kynges, doubtles, whose names we purpose / to shewe with lycens, But pryncypally / of the kyngdome of Mercyens. 22 The fyrst realme of Saxons / began in Kent, The yere of grace / foure hundreth fyue and fyfty; Where duke Engystus / in honour excellent, With septre and crowne / fyrst reygned royally. The seconde was Southsex / sayth the hystory, Wher Adla and Ella / reygned full ryght; Whiche realme endured / but short tyme in myght. 23 The thyrde was Westsaxons / famous and myghty, Where fyrst reygned / kynge Cerdicus, The yere of our lorde / fyue hundreth one and twenty; Whiche realme by processe / and power vyctoryous Subdued all other / to hym, full memorous. The pryncypall Cytees / of his regalyte Were in olde season / Wynchester and Salesburye. 24 The fourth was Estsex / Where duke Erchenwyn Fyrst reygned kynge / hauynge domynacyon, By the kynge of Merselande / brought ofte to ruyne; The chyef Cytee was Colchester / of his domynyon.

Ca. vii. 98 This blessed lady / and royall prynces, Descendynge of noble / and hye parentage, Was doughter to Vulfer / the legende dothe rehers, Kynge of Mercelande / and of famous lynage, Her mother Ermenylde / ioyned to hym in maryage; They dwelled somtyme / a lytell frome Stone At a place in Stafforde-shyre / amyddes his regyon. 99 They had bytwene them / other chyldren thre: Vulfade and Ruffyn / martyrs full gloryous, Synt Kenrede his prynce / of greate auctoryte, Tumylate at Rome / a confessour gracyous. The lyues of these thre / we wyll not now dyscus, But speke of the ghostly / and meke conuersacyon Of blessed Werburge / now at this season. 100 For as declareth / the true Passyonary, A boke wherin / her holy lyfe wryten is‚Äî Whiche boke remayneth / in Chester monastery‚Äî I purpose by helpe / of Ihesu, kynge of blys, In any wyse to reherse / any sentence amys, But folowe the legende / and true hystory, After an humble style / and from it lytell vary. 101 This blessed Werburge / from her natyuyte Folowynge the counseyll / of her noble parentes, Dysposed her selfe / euer to humylyte, Obedyent to them / with all reuerens, Loth to dysplease / or make any offens Or dysquyet any reasonable creature‚Äî Thus was her maner / in youthe, be ye sure. 102 Sadde and demure / of her countenaunce, Stable in gesture / proued in euery place, Sobre of her wordes / all vertu to auaunce, Humble / meke / and mylde / replete with grace. Many vertuous maners / in her founde there was, And dyuers gyftes naturall / to her appropryate, As was conuenyent / for so noble a state. 103 And as she encreased / moore and more in age, A newe plant of goodnes / in her dayly dyd sprynge, Great grace and vertue / were set in her ymage. Wherof her father / had moche merueylynge; Her mother mused / of this ghostly thynge: To beholde so yonge / and tender a may From vertu to vertu / to procede euery day. 104 No merueyll it is / who-so taketh hede In naturall thynges / the dyuers operacyon. Dothe not a royall rose / from a brere procede, Passynge the stocke / with pleasaunt dylectacyon? The swete ryuer passeth / by due probacyon His heed and fountayne: / ryght so dothe she Transcende her parentes / with great benygnyte. 105 And tho her bretherne / delyted for to here For theyr soule-helthe / ghostly exortacyon, yet she them passed / manyfolde more clere In loue of our lorde / and meke conuersacyon. And lyke as Phebus / in his heuenly regyon Passed other stretes / shynynge moost pure, So dothe this vyrgyn / aboue the cours of nature. 106 Lordes / dukes / barons / within the kynges hall Merueyled on her maners / and constaunte sobrynes; The plente of wysedome / and dyscrecyon withall In so tender age / they neuer knewe expresse; Her mynde so perfyte / auoydynge all ylnes; But they knewe well / it pretended by all reasone Synguler grace and goodnes / to her comynge soone, 107 Affyrmynge on this wyse / yf she wolde contynu With suche vertuous maner / in yeres of hye dyscrecyon, That she sholde do honour / by the grace of Ihesu Vnto all her kynrede / and synguler consolacyon, An ensample of vertu / and humylyacyon, Theyr conforte / theyr tresure / and sterre full bryght, And chefe lumynary / shynynge day and nyght. 108 Fyrst in the mornynge / to chyrche she wolde go, Folowynge her mother / the quene, euery day, With her boke and bedes / and departe not them fro, Here all deuyne seruyce / and her deuocyons say And to our blessed sauyour / mekely on knees pray, Dayly hym desyrynge / for his endeles grace and pyte To kepe her frome synne / and preserue her in chastyte. 109 Where youthe is dysposed / of naturall mocyon To dysportes and pleasures / full of vanyte, This mayde was euer / of sadde dysposycyon, Constaunt and dyscrete / styll and womanle, Gladde in her soule / to here speke of chastyte, Clennes and sobrenes / and ioyfull for to here Ghostly exortacyons / to her herte moost dere. How this yonge vyrgyn saynt Werburge was desyred of dukes &amp; erles in maryage / and of the answere she gaue to them / in auoydynge worldly pleasures. Ca. viii. 110 As tender youthe passed / this blessed maydyn Dayly encreased / more and more in vertue, In ghostly scyence / and vertuous dyscyplyne, Obseruynge the doctryne / of our lorde Ihesu, Had his commaundymentes / in her herte full tru; So that no creature / more perfyte myght be In vertuous gyftes (by grace) than she. 111 She was replete / with gyftes naturall: Her vysage moost pleasaunt / fayre and amyable, Her goodly eyes / clerer than the crystall, Her countenaunce comly / swete and commendable; Her herte lyberall / her gesture fauourable. She, lytell consyderynge / these gyftes transytory, Set her felycyte / in chryst perpetually. 112 She hadde moche worshyp / welthe / and ryches, Vestures / honoures / reuerence and royalte; The ryches she dysposed / with great mekenesse To the poore people / with great charyte. But her sadnes / constaunce / and humylyte, Vertue / gentylnes / so pacyent and colde, Transcended all these other / a thousande folde. 113 The vertuous maners / and excellent fame Of this holy vyrgyn / redoubted so ferre In all this regyon / in praysynge her name, That the nobles of this lande / wolde not dyfferre, But with ryche apparell / and myghty power Came for to seke her‚Äî / lyke as to Salomon Quene Saba approched / to here of his wysedome. 114 So lyke-wyse some came / to her of her vertue, Some of her sadnesse / and prudent dyscrecyon, Some for her constaunce / so stable and true, Some of her chastyte / and pregnaunt reason, Some for her beaute / and famous wysedome; And some, that were borne / of kynges lygnage, Desyred yf they myght / haue her in maryage. 115 In beaute amyable / she was equall to Rachell, Comparable to Sara / in fyrme fidelyte, In sadnes and wysedom / lyke to Abygaell: Replete as Delbora / with grace of prophecy, Equyualent to Ruth / she was in humylyte, In pulchrytude Rebecca / lyke Hester in lolynesse, Lyke Iudyth in vertue / and proued holynesse. 116 The prynce of Westsaxons / a pere of this lande, Wyllynge to haue her by way of maryage, With humble reuerence / as we vnderstande, Sayd to her these wordes / wysely and sage: ‚ÄòO souerayne lady / borne of hye lynage, O beautefull creature / and imperyall prynces, This is my full mynde / that I now rehers. 117 ‚ÄòFrom my fathers realme / hyder I am come Vnto our presence / yf ye be so content, With worshyp and honour / and moche renowne, In all honest maner / aperynge euydent; My mynde is on you set / with loue feruent, To haue you in maryage / all other to forsake, If it be your pleasure / thus me for to take. 118 ‚Äòye shalbe asured / a quene for to be, ye shall haue ryches / worshyp / and honour, Royall ryche appareyll / and eke the sufferaynte, Precyous stones in golde / worthy a kynges tresour, Landes / rentes / and lybertees / all at your pleasur, Seruauntes euery houre / your byddynge for to do, With ladyes in your chambre / to wayte on you also.‚Äô 119 With these kynde wordes / the vyrgyn abasshed sore And with mylde countenaunce / answered hym agayne The playnes of her mynde / to rest for euermore, Sayenge: ‚Äòo noble prynce / I thanke you now, certayne, For youre gentyll offer / shewed to me so playne, ye be well worthy / for your regalyte To haue a better maryage / an hundreth folde than me. 120 ‚ÄòBut now I shewe you / playnly my true mynde: My purpose was neuer / maryed for to be; A lorde I haue chosen / redemer of mankynde, Ihesu, the seconde persone in trynyte, To be my spouse / to Whome my vyrgynyte I haue depely vowed / endurynge all my lyfe, His seruaunt to be / true spouses and wyfe. 121 ‚ÄòTherfore, noble prynce / hertfully I you pray, Tempte me no forther / after suche condycyon, Whiche am so stedfast / and wyll be nyght and day Neuer for to chaunge / nor make alteracyon.

How √æ? false Werbode desyred kynge Vulfer to haue Werburge, his doughter, in maryage. And how y? kynge graunted therto. Ca. ix. 124 As afore is sayd / whan Penda the kynge By saynt Oswy kynge / at Leedes was slayne And Vulfer his sone / the fourth yere folowynge Was baptysed and crowned / By bysshop Fynane, A solempne voue he made / faythfull and certayne, All temples of ydolles / in his realme to destroy And chaunge them to chyrches / and newe edyfy. 125 The same he promysed / as he was true knyght Whan that he maryed / blessed Ermenylde, Dredynge sore the iustyce / of god almyght For his fathers demerytes / vnreconsyled On hym to fall sodeynly / and so be begyled; Promysynge a-mendes / at his conuersyon Vnto holy chyrche / with humble deuocyon. 126 Whiche kynge Vulfer / as was the more pyte, By the wycked counseyll / of a fals knyght Called Werbode / ranne soone in apostasy, For a lytell whyle / wantynge perfyte lyght; The bryghtnes of the day / was tourned to nyght Whan he gaue credence / that creature vnto, Prolongynge the actes / he promysed to do. 127 Vnder kynge Vulfer / chefe stewarde of his hall Was this false Werbode / ruler of euery porte.

This cite of legions was whilom the bysshops se Vnto all south-wales / nominat Wenedocie. 54 Another cite of legions we may fynde also In the west part of Englande / by the water of Dee, Called Caerlleon of britons longe ago, After named Chestre, by great auctorite; Iulius the emperour sende to this sayd cite A legion of knyghtes / for to subdue Irelande; Like-wyse dyd Claudius (as we vnderstande). 55 The founder of Chestre / as sayth Policronicon, Was Lleon Gauer / a myghty stronge gyaunt, Whiche buylded caues and dongions many one, No goodly buyldyng / propre ne pleasaunt; But the Kynge Leil, a briton sure and valiaunt, Was founder of Chestre by pleasaunt buyldyng, And of Caerleil also / named by the kynge. 56 Ranulphus in his cronicle yet doth expresse The cite of Chestre edified for to be By the noble romans prudence and richesse Whan a legion of knyghtes was sende to the cite, Rather than by the wysdome of Britons or policie; Obiectyng clere agaynst the britons fundacion, Whiche auctour resteth in his owne opinion. 57 Kyng Marius, a bryton, regnyng in prosperite In the West partie of this noble region, Ampliat and walled strongly Chestre cite And myghtyly fortified the sayd foundacion. Thus eche auctour holdeth a singular opinion. This Marius slewe Reodric, kyng of pictis lande, Callyng the place of his name Westmarilande. 58 This ‚Äòcite of legions,‚Äô so called by the Romans, Nowe is nominat in latine of his proprete Cestria quasi castria / of honour and pleasance: Proued by the buyldynge of olde antiquite In cellers and lowe voultes / and halles of realte Lyke a comly castell / myghty, stronge and sure, Eche house like a toure, somtyme of great pleasure. 59 Vnto the sayd Chestre all northwales subiect were For reformacion, Iustice and iugement; Theyr bysshops see also it was many a yere Enduryng the gouernaunce of brutes auncient; To saxons and britons a place indifferent; The inhabitauntes of it manfull and liberall, Constant, sad and vertuous / and gentyll continuall. 60 Of frutes and cornes there is great habundaunce, Woddes / parkes / forestes / and beestis of venare, Pastures / feeldes / comons / the cite to auaunce, Waters /pooles/ pondes / of fysshe great plente; Most swete holsome ayre by the water of dee; There is great marchandise / shyps / and wynes strang, With all thyng of pleasure the cite?ens amonge. 61 The yere of our lorde a hundreth sixe and fyfty Reigned vpon this lande a briton kyng Lucius, Whiche with great desire required instantly His realme to be bapti?ed of pope Eleutherius. Whose charitable mocion was harde full gratius: The pope enioyed / graunted his peticion And sende .ii. doctours to conuerte this region. 62 The doctours by prechyng and singular grace In short tyme conuerted the greatter Britayne; The people confessed their synne and trespase, Bapti?ed all were / forgyuenes dyd attayne; Idolatrie cessed through-out this lande, certayne; With grace circumfulced and lyghtned was Englande, By faith to god professed was all Wales and scotlande. 63 Kynge Lucius ordeyned / by the doctours mocion xxviii. bisshops in this realme for to be, And .iii. archebisshops, for gostly exhortacion, To reduce the people to vertue and humilite. At London was set the chiefe archebisshops se, The seconde in south-Wales at cite of legions, The thyrde was at yorke, all subiect to the britons. 64 Churches were edified in many a place Here in the more Britayne with diligent labour, Christis faith encreased by speciall grace, Faithfull religion delated euery hour; Diuine seruice was songon &amp; sayd with great honour, True faith and deuocion were dayly encreasynge, Namely in Chestre by grace continuall abidynge. 65 Certaynly, sith baptym came to Chestre cite, Soone after Lucius / and afore kynge Arthure, By the grace of god and their humilite, The faith of holy churche dyd euer there endure Without recidiuacion and infection / sure; Wherfore it is worthy a singular commendacion, Aboue all the citees and townes of this region. 66 The perfect begynnyng and fyrst foundacion Of the monasterie within the sayd cite Was at the same tyme by famus opinion That baptym began within this countre; The great lordes of Chestre of landes and auncetre First edified the churche for comfort spirituall In honour of the apostels Peter and Paule. 67 Whiche churche was principall to all the citie, And the mouther-churche called withouten doubt; It was their buriall by great auctorite, To all this sayd cite / and .vii. myle without; The cemiterie was large to compase it about.

The Name of britons was chaunged that season, Were named walshemen, in the montaynes segregate, Euer to the saxons hauynge inwarde hate. 99 The Walshemen that tyme had ouer them a kyng Called Griffinus / to be theyr gouernour, Electe by the comons their appetite folowyng, Endurate with malice / couetise and rancour, Ennemies to englisshemen / as is said before. This kyng entended by mortall enuy The cite of Chestre to spoyle and distrye. 100 A myghty host discended from the mountans, Well armed and strongely approchyng the cite, Prepared for batell, with them great ordinaunce.

But one of the ennemyes with great wyckednes Smot the sayd shryne in castyng of a stone, And it empaired / piteous to loke vpon. 103 Anone great punysshement vpon them all lyght: The kyng and his host were smytten with blyndnes, That of the cite / they had no maner of syght; And he that smote the holy shryne, doubtles, Was greuously vexed with a sprite of darkenes, And with hidous payne expired miserably‚Äî The kynge was sore a-dred / and all his company. 104 Shortly the kynge remoued his great host, Departed from the cite without any praye, And gaue in commaundement in euery coost Saynt Werburge landes to meynteyne alway, Assigned her possessions euer after that day With the signe of the crosse, a token euident, In pleasyng this virgin / for drede of punysshement. Howe saynt Werburge cured and healed a woman thre tymes (whiche was halte and lame) to helth and prosperite agayne.
