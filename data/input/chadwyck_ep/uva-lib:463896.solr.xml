      <field name="fulltext">Longum Iter per Præcepta, breve &amp; efficax per Exempla. Si Præceptis non accendimur, saltem Exemplis incitemur, atque in Appetitu Rectitudinis nil sibi Mens nostra difficile æstimet, quod perfectè peragi ab Aliis videt. Greg. Mag. l. 9. c. 43. Id peragas Vitâ, quod velles Morte peractum. The Authors Designe. Of CHRIST, and of the Spouses Sighs, I sing, And of the Joyes that from Those Ardors spring, The World ne're knew; Of her Souls mystick Sense, And of her Heav'nly Zeal. Blinde Lust, pack hence, Hence Pride, exhausting Wealth; Hence, Envie, flie, Pal'd at Success; hence foul-mouth'd Calumnie, And savage Discord, striving to divide United Mindes; with all Sins Troop beside. JESUS! grant I may follow Thee, my Feet Wing Thou, and make them in pursuance fleet! Close up my Cracks by Faith, so shall I be A Vessel made of Honour unto THEE. I'm but a faint Resultance from thy Light, Which, at Sols Rise and Set, enchears my Sight. No Space thy View, no Glory bounds thy Praise, No Terms do reach thy Worth, no Age thy Dayes! May I but swear Obedience to thy Laws, And crave THEE PATRON to my present Cause! My Subject's Theophil, for Heav'n design'd, Off'ring pure Sacrifice with sacred Mind. [We jangle not in Shools, but strain to set] LADIES, We jangle not in Shools, but strain to set Church-Musick, at which Saints being met, May warble forth Heav'ns Praise, and thence Heav'ns Blessing get. Church-Anthems irksome to the Factious grow; In what a sad Case were They, trow, Should They be penn'd in Heav'n, where Hymns for ever flow? As, fir'd Affections to your Beauties move: So, Stillatories be of Love; That, what was Vapour, may, by Virtue, Essence prove. Survey Theophila; her Rules apply, That You may live, as You would die: Virtue enamels Life; 'Tis Grace does glorifie. O, may those fragrant Flow'rs that in Her grew, Blown by such Breath, drench't by such Dew, Spring, &amp; display their Buds, Ladies Elect, in You! To this Spring-Garden, Virgins, chast and fair, Coacht in pure Thoughts, make your Repair, To recreate your Mindes, and take fresh Heav'nly Air. Ye snowy Fires, observe her in each Grace; So, may You, bright in Soul as Face, Have in The Gallery of Heroick Women Place. Nay, when your Dayes and Piety shall summe Up their Compleatness, may Ye come To endlesse Glories Court, and with blest Souls have Room! [When that great Gen'ralissimo of all] When that great Gen'ralissimo of all Infernal Janizaries shall His Legions of Temptations raise, enroul, And muster Them 'gainst Thee, my Soul: And Ranks of Pleasures, Profits, Honours bring, To give a Charge on the right Wing: And place his dreadful Troops of deadly Sins Upon the Left, with murth'ring Gins: And draw to his main Bodie thousand Lusts, And for Reserve, wherein he trusts, Shall specious Sanctities Brigade provide, Whose Leader is spiritual Pride: And having treacherously laid his Trains In Ambush, under Hope of Gains By sinning, as so many Scouts, to finde Each March and Posture of thy Mind: Then, Soul, sound an Alarm to Faith, and presse Thy Zeal to be in Readinesse; And leavie all thy Faculties to serve Thy CHIEFE. Take Pray'r for thy Reserve Under the Conduct of his SPIRIT; See Under the Banner that they be Of thy Salvations CAPTAIN: Then be sure That all thy Out-works stand secure. Yet narrower look into th' indenting Line Of thy ambiguous Thoughts: Designe With constant Care a Watch o're every Part; Ev'n at thy Cinque-ports, and thy Heart Set Centinels: Let Faith be Captain o're The Life-Guard, standing at the Dore Of thy well-warded Breast: Disloyal Fear That corresponds with Guilt, cashear. Nor let Hypocrisie sneak in and out Thy Garrison, with that Spie, Doubt. The Watch-word be IMMANUEL: Then set Strong Parties of thy Tears; and let Them still to salie forth prepared stand, And but expect the Souls Command; Waiting until a blest Recruit from High Be sent, with Graces free Supplie. Thus where the LORD of Hosts the Van leads, there Triumphant Palms bring up the Rere. TO MY FANCIE UPON THEOPHILA. Fly, Fancie, Beauties arched Brow, Darts, wing'd with Fire, thence sparkling flow. From Flash of Lightning Eye-balls turn; Contracted Beams of Chrystal burn. Wave Curls, which Wit Gold-tresses calls, That golden Fleece to Tinsel falls. Evade Thou peach-bloom Cheek-Decoies, Where both the Roses blend false Joyes. Presse not the two-leav'd Rubie Gates, Which fence their Pearl-Portcullis Grates. Suck not the Breath, though it return Fragrant, as Phœnix spicie Urn. Lock up thine Ears, and so disarm The Magick of inamoring Charm. The lily'd Breasts with Violets vein'd Are Flow'rs, as soon deflowr'd as gain'd. Love-locks, Perfume, Paint, Spots dispraise; These by the Black-Art Spirits raise. Garnish no Bristows with rich Mine, Glow-worms are Vermin, though they shine. Should one Love-knot All Lovelies tie, This One, These All, soon cloy and die. Cupid, as lame as blinde, being gone, Live One with Him, Who made Thee One. Avoid exotick Pangs o'th' Brain, Nor let thy Margent blush a Stain. With artful Method Misc'line sow: May Judgement with Invention grow. Profit with Pleasure bring to th' Test, Be Oar refin'd, before imprest. Passe Forge and File, be Point and Edge 'Gainst what severest Browes alledge. Mix Balm with Ink; Let thy Salt heal: T' each Palate various Manna deal. Have for the Wise strong Sense, deep Truth: Grand-Sallet of choice Wit for Youth. Cull Metaphors well-weigh'd and clear, Enucle'ate Mysteries to th' Ear. Be Wit Stenography'd, yet free; 'Tis largest in Epitome. Fly through Arts Heptarchie, be clad With Wings to soar, but not to gad. Thy Pineons raise with mystick Fire, Sometimes 'bove high-roof't Sense aspire. So draw Theoph'la, that each Line, Centring in Heav'n, may seem Divine. Her Voice soon fits Thee for that Quire; W' are cindred by intrinsick Fire. Magnetick Virtue's in her Brest Impregn'd with Grace, the noblest Guest. Who in Loves Albo are enrol'd, Unutterable Joyes behold. Geographers Earths Globe survey, Fancie, Heavn's Astrolabe display. Six hast thou view'd of Europs Courts, Soon, as Idæas, pass'd their Sports. Sense, canst thou perse and construe Blisse? Only Souls sanctify'd know This. Then hackney not to Toyes, Lifes Span. The Saints Rere tops the Courtiers Van. In Hopes Cell holy Hermit be: Let Ecstasies transfigure Thee. There, as Truths Champion, strive all Waies, To storm Loves Towre with Hosts of Praise. Keep strong Faiths Court of Guard. The Stars March in Batalia to these Wars. Zealous in Pray'r besiege the Skie, Conquests are Crown'd by Constancie: Stand Cen'tnell at the Bridegrooms Gates; Who serve there, reign o're earthly States, Rais'd on Devotions flaming Wings Disdain the crakling Blaze of Things. No Musick courts Spiritual Ears Like high-tun'd Anthems; This uprears Thee, Fancie, rapt through Mists of Fears, And Clouds of Penitential Tears; Eagling 'bove transitory Sphears, Till ev'n the Invisible appears. Divorc'd from past and present Toyes, Spouse New Jerus'lems future Joyes; Be Re-baptiz'd in Eye-dew-Fall, Of All forgot, forget Thou All. These Acts well kept, Commence, and prove Professor in Seraphick Love. A Friends ECCHO to his Fancie upon SACRATA. I When Fancie bright Sacrata courts, It is not with accustom'd Sports; 'Tis not in prizing of her Eyes, To the Disvalue of the Skies; Nor robbing Gardens of their Hue, To give her flowrie Cheeks their Due. II 'Tis not in stripping of the Sea For Coral, to resigne that Plea It hath to the Vermilion Die, If that her raddy Lips be nigh, Or that I long to see them ope, As if I thence for Pearl did hope. III Nor is't in promising my Ears Rather to her than to the Sphears; Or that a Smile of hers displayes As much Content as Phœbus Rayes, Or that her Hand for Whitenesse shames The down of Swans on Silver Thames. IV Let such on these Romances dwell, Who do admire Loves Husk and Shell. Hark, wanton Fair-ones, all your Fawns Are Happinesses haplesse Pawns: With these alone the Mind does Flag; Beauty is oft the Souls Black Bag V Pure Flames that ravish with their Fire, Ascend unmeasurably Higher; Which after Search we find to be In Virtue linkt with Pietie. The Radiations of the Soul All Splendors of the Flesh controul. VI Fond Sense, cry up a rosie Skin, Sacrata rosy'd is within: But brighter THEOPHIL behold, Whose Vest is wrought with, torsled Gold. LOVES self in her his Flame embeams, LOVES Sacrifice ZEALS Rapture seems. VII Of Paradise before the Fall This Saint is Emblematical. Then, Fancie, give Her due Renown, She's Queen of Arts; This Book, her Crown. Sacrata turns Castara unto us, And Benlovves (Anagramm'd) Benevolus. JER. COLLIER, M. A. and Fell. of S. Johns Coll. Camb. Non me Palma negata Macrum, data reddet Opimum. A smooth clear Vein should have it Sourse From Nature, and have Art but Nurse: Which, though it Men at Athens feasts, May fight at Ephesus with Beasts. Wits, rudely hal'd to Momus Bar, By braying Beasts condemned are. Reason! How many Brutes there be 'Mong Men, 'cause not inform'd by Thee? Vates Pòet-Prophet is; If good, Alike both scorn'd, and understood. Though Readers Censure's Writers Fate, Spleen sha'nt contract, nor Praise dilate. Or clap, or hisse. The Moon sails round, Though bark'd at by each yelping Hound. The brighter Shee, the more they bark; But slumbring quetch not in the dark. Deign Him, bright Souls, your piercing Glance, (Arts Foes are Sons of Ignorance) So, freed from Nights rude Overseers, The Poet may be try'd by his Peers. A VERDICT FOR THE Pious SACRIFICER. To shine, and light, not scorch, thy Muse did aim; And so hath rais'd this Quintessential Flame. By th' Salt, and Whiteness of her Lines, We think With holy Water (Tears) She mixt her Ink; And both the Fire and Food of this chast Muse Is more what Altars, than what Tables use. Who does not pray with Zeal thy Faith may move, Rightly concentrick with thy Hope and Love. So, in the Temple these Religious Hosts From Hecatombs may rise to Holocausts. WALTER MONTAGUE, Com. Manch. Filius. FOR THE AUTHOR, Truly Heroick, By BLOUD, VIRTUE, LEARNING. Scholar, Commander, Traveller commixt; Schools, Camps, &amp; Courts raise Fame, &amp; make it fixt. Your Fame and Feet have Alps and Oceans past: Fam'd Feet! which Art can't raise, nor Envie blast. Beaumont and Fletcher coyn'd a golden Way, T' expresse, suspend, and passionate a Play. Nimble and pleasant are all Motions there, For two Intelligences rul'd the Spheare. Both Sock and Buskin sunk with Them, and then Davenant and Denham buoy'd them up agen. Beyond these Pillars Some think nothing is: Great Britains Wit stands in a Precipice. But, Sir, as though Heav'ns Streits discover'd were, By Science of your Card, Unknovvns appear: Sail then with Prince of Wits, illustrious Dunne, Who rapt Earth round with Love, and was its Sun. But your first Love was pure: Whose ev'ry Dresse Is inter-tissu'd Wit and Holinesse; And mends upon It self; whose Streams (that meet With Sands and Herberts) grow more deep, more sweet. I, wing'd with Joy, to th' Prælibation fly; Thence view I Errours Trage-comedie: With Theophil from Fear to Faith I rise, The mystick Bridge, twixt Hell and Paradise. Hell scap't seems double Heav'n: Renevv'd, with Bands Of Pray'rs, Vows, Tears, with Eyes, and Knees, and Hands, I see her cope with Heav'n, and Heav'n does thence, As in the Baptists Dayes, feel Violence. But her ecstatick Songs Of Love, declare To Jedidiah, Shee's apparent Heir. Be those then next, The Song OF Songs. Love stiles Her Fourth, The Second Book of Canticles. But with what dreadfull yet delightful Tones She sings when Glorify'd? Then, stinglesse Drones Are Death and Hell: Joyes Crescent then's encreast, To fullest Lustre, at her Bridal Feast. Sixth, Sev'nth, and Eighth such Banquets frame would make Wisdom turn Cormorant; my Spirits shake Ith' Reading. Soul of Joy! thy ravishing Sp'rite Draws bedrid Mindes to longing Appetite. Fame, write with Gold on Diamond Pages; treat Upon the Glories of a Work so great. Be't then Enacted, that all Graces dwell In Thee, Theoph'la, Virtues Chronicle: Who jemm'st it in Jerusalem Above, Where all is Grace and Glory, Light and Love. To That, Unparallel, This comes so neer, That, 't is a Glimpse of Heav'n to reade Thee here. O, blest Ambition! Speculations high Enchariot Thee, Elijah-like, to th' Skie! What State worth Envy, like Thy sweet Abode, That overtops the World, and mounts to GOD? Walkt through your Eden Stanza's, you invite Our ravisht Souls to recre'ate with Delight, In Bow'r of compt Discourse: Great Verse, but Prose Such, None but our Great Master could compose. For Bulk, an easie Folio is this All; Yet we a Volume may each Canto call, For Solid Matter: where we should consult On Paragraphs, mark what does thence result: For, every Period's of Devotion Proof, And each Resolve is of concern'd Behoof. Peruse, Examine, Censure; ô, how bright Does shine Religion, checquer'd with Delight! Diffusive Soul! your Spirit was soaring, when This Manna dew'd from your inspired Pen. Such melting Passions of a Soul divine, Could They be cast in any Mould but Thine? Wonder arrests our Thought; That you alone In such Combustions, wherein Thousands grone, (And when some Sparkles of the publick Flame Seiz'd on your private State, and scorcht the same) Could warble Thus. Steer Ships each Pilot may In Calms; but Who so can in Stormie Day May justly domineer. But what may daunt Him, who, like Mermaids, thus in Storms can chaunt? Grace crowns the Suff'ring, Glory the Triumphing Saint. Th. Pestill, Regi quondam à Sacris. [Those Ladies, Sir, we Virtuosa's call] Those Ladies, Sir, we Virtuosa's call, But Copies are to this Original; Whose charming Empire of her Grace does Sense Astonish by a Super-Excellence. And, like as Midas Touch made Gold: So, thus Theophila's Touch may make Theophilus. Zeuxes cull'd out Perfections of each sort For his Pandora; yet did All come short As far of This Embellishment as She Had been limn'd out in Paintings Infancie. For, Magisterial Virtue draws no Grace From Corp'ral Limbs, or Features of the Face. Here Heav'n-born Suadas, Star-like, gild each Dresse Of the Bride Soul espous'd to Happinesse. Here Pietie informs Poetick Art; As All in All, and all in every Part. For All These dy'd not with fam'd Cartwright, though A Score of Poets joyn'd to have it so. T. Benlowes. A. M. A GLANCE AT THEOPHILA. Who sacrificed last? The hallow'd Air Seems all ensould with sweet Perfume, Which pleased Heav'n deigns to assume, The smiling Skie appeareth brightly fair; Was't not Theophila's fam'd Sire, Say, sacred Priest, obtain'd the holy Fire To blesse, and burn his Victime of sublime Desire? Know, curious Mortal, this rare Sacrifice, Scarce known to our now-bedrid Age, Was got by Zeal, and holy Rage, And offer'd by Benevolus the Wise: For, speckled Craft, and a loose Fit Of aguish Knowledge, glim'ring Acts beget; Chast Piety bears Fruit to Wisdom, not to Wit. No Tigers Whelp with Blood-besmeared Jaws, No Cub of Bears, lick't into Shape, No lustfull Ofspring of the Ape, No muskie Panther with close guileful Claws, No durtie gruntling of the Swine, No Lions Whelp of êre so high Design, Is offer'd here: Keep off Unclean! Here's all divine. The chosen Wood (as Harbinger to all Those future then, now passed Rites) Was Laurel, that Guards Lightning Frights, The weeping Firre, sad Yewe for Funeral, The lasting Oak, and joyful Vine, The fruitful Fig-tree Billets did consigne; The peaceful Olive with cleft Juniper did joyn. On Knees in Tears think Altar'd Theophil, Incenst with sweet Obedience, Who makes Loves Life in Death commence, Scaling with Heart, Hands, Eyes, Heav'ns lofty Hill: Her circled Head you might behold Was glorify'd with burnisht Crown of Gold, Embost with Gems; embrac't by Angels manifold. Thus in a fierie Chariot up She flies, Perfuming the forsaken Earth, (The Widwife Orbs do help her Birth) Into the Glorie of the Hierarchies. Where Ecstasies of Joyes do grow, Which they Themselves eternally do sow, But 'tis too high for Me to think, or Thee to know. Priests thus by Hiroglyphick Keyes Unlock their hidden Mysteries. W. Dennie Baronet. TO THE AUTHOR Upon His Divine Poem. Till now I gues'd but blindly to what Height The Muses Eagles could maintain their flight! Though Poets are, like Eaglets, bred to soar, Gazing on Starrs at Heav'ns mysterious Pow'r, Yet I observe they quickly stoop to ease Their Wings, and pearch on Palace-Pinacles: From thence more usefully they Courts discern; The Schools where Greatnesse does Disguises learn; The Stages where She acts to vulgar sight Those Parts which States-men as her Poets write; Where none but those wise Poets may survay The private practise of her publick Play; Where Kings, Gods Counterfeits, reach but the Skill In study'd Sceans to act the Godhead ill: Where Cowards, smiling in their Closets, breed Those Wars which make the vain and furious bleed: Where Beauty playes not meerly Natures part, But is, like Pow'r, a Creature form'd by Art; And, as at first, Pow'r by Consent was made, And those who form'd it did themselves invade: So harmlesse Beauty (which has now far more Injurious Force than States or Monarchs Power) Was by consent of Courts allow'd Arts Aid; By which themselves they to her Sway betray'd. Twas Art, not Nature, taught excessive Power; Which whom it lists does favour or devour: Twas Art taught Beauty the imperial Skill Of ruling, not by Justice, but by Will. And, as successive Kings scarce seem to reign, Whilst lazily they Empires Weight sustain; Thinking because their Pow'r they Native call Therefore our Duty too is Naturall; And by presuming that we ought obay, They lose the craft and exercise of Sway: So, when at Court a native Beauty reigns O're Love's wilde Subjects, and Arts help disdains; When her presumptuous Sloth findes not why Art In Pow'rs grave Play does act the longest part; When, like proud Gentry, she does levell all Industrious Arts with Arts mechanicall; And vaunts of small inheritance no lesse Than new States boast of purchas'd Provinces; Whilst she does every other Homage scorn, But that to which by Nature she was born: Thus when so heedlesly She Lovers swayes, As scarce she findes her Pow'r ere it decayes; Which is her Beauty, and which unsupply'd By what wise Art would carefully provide, Is but Loves Lightning, and does hardly last Till we can say it was ere it be past; Soon then when Beautie's gone she turns her face, Asham'd of that which was erewhile her Grace; So, when a Monarch's gone, the Chair of State Is backward turn'd where He in Glory sate. The secret Arts of Love and Pow'r; how these Rule Courts, and how those Courts rule Provinces, Have been the task of every noble Muse; Whose Aid of old nor Pow'r nor Love did use Meerly to make their lucky Conquests known (Though to the Muse they owe their first Renown; For She taught Time to speak, and ev'n to Fame, Who gives the Great their Names, She gave a Name) But they by studying Numbers rather knew To make those happy whom they did subdue. Here let me shift my Sails! and higher bear My Course than that which moral Poets steer! For now (best Poet!) I Divine would be; And only can be so by studying Thee. Those whom thy Flights do lead shall pass no more Through darkning Clouds when they to Heav'n would sore; Nor in Ascent fear such excesse of Light As rather frustrates than maintains the Sight; For thou dost clear Heav'ns darkned Mysteries, And mak'st the Luster safe to weakest Eyes. Noiselesse, as Planets move, thy Numbers flow, And soft as Lovers Whispers when they woo! Thy labourd Thoughts with Ease thou dost dispence, Clothing in Mayden Dresse a Manly Sence. And as in narrow Room Elixir lies; So in a little thou dost much comprise. Here fix thy Pillars! which as Marks shall be How far the Soul in Heav'ns discovery Can possibly advance; yet, whilst they are Thy Trophies, they but warrant our Despair: For, humane Excellence hath this ill Fate That where it Vertue most doth elevate It bears the blot of being singular; And Envy blasts that Fame it cannot share: Ev'n good Examples may so Great be made As to discourage whom they should perswade. WILL. DAVENANT. TOWER, May 13?? 1652. For the much Honoured AUTHOR. The winged Intellect once taught to fly By Art and Reason, may be bold to pry Into the Secrets of a wandring Star, Although its Motions be irregular: And from the Smiles and Glances that those bright Corrivals cast, that do embellish Night, Guesse darkly at, though not directly know, The various Changes that fall here below. And perching on the high'st Perimeter, May finde the Distances of every Sphere, Which in full Orbs do move, tunicled so That the lesse Spheres within the greater go, As Cell in Cell, spun by the dying Flie; Or Ball in Ball, turn'd in smooth Ivorie. Each hath a Prince circled upon a Throne, In a refulgent Habitation. Only the Constellations seem to be Like Nobles, in an Aristocrasie. Their milkie Way like Innocence, and thus Should all great Actions be Diaphanous. But the great Monarch, Light, disposes All: His Stores are Magazine, and Festivall: And by his Pow'r Earths Epicycle may Move in a silver Sphere, as well as They. Else, her poor little Orb appears to be A very Point to their Immensitie. Thus strung, like Beads, They on their Centers move; But the great Center of this All, is Love. Though the brute Creatures by the height of Sense Foretell their calm and boystrous Influence, Yet to finde out their Motions is Mans part, Not by the help of Nature, but of Art, Which rarifies the Soul, and makes it rise, And sees no farther than that gives it Eyes. And by that Prospect will directly tell What Regions stoop to every Parallel. Which Cities furred are with Snow, which lie Naked, and scorcht under Heav'ns Canopie. How Men, like Cloves stuck in an Orenge, stand Still upright, with their Feet upon the Land. And where the Seas oppos'd to us do flow, Yet quench they not that Heat where Spices grow. It sees fair Mornings rising Neck beset With orient Jems, like a rich Carcanet. Who every Night doth send her Beams to spie In what dark Caves her golden Treasures lie: And there they brood and hatch the callow Race, Till they take wing, and fly in every place. It sees the frozen Firre shrouding its Arms, While Cocus Trees are courted with blest Charms, That swell their pregnant Womb: whose Issue may Sweeten our World, but that they die by th' Way. It sees the Seasons lying at the Door, Some warm and wanton, and some cold and poor; And knows from whence they come, both foul &amp; fair, And from their Presence gilds, or soils the Air. It sees plain Natures Face, how rude it looks Till it be polished by Men and Books; And most of her dark Secrets can discover To open View of an industrious Lover. What ever under Heav'ns great Throne we prize Or value, in Arts Chamber-practise lies. But when before the Almighty Judge he come To speak of Him, my Oratour is dumb. Go then, thou silent Soul, present thy Plea By the fair Hand of sweet Theophila. Hap'ly thy harsh and broken Strains may rise In the Perfume of her sweet Sacrifice: And if by this Accesse thou find'st a Way To th' highest Throne, alas! what canst thou say? What can the Bubble (though its Breath it bring Upon the gliding Stream) say of the Spring? Can the proud painted Flow'r boast that it knows The Root that bears it, and whereon it grows? Or can the crawling Worm, though ne're so stout, With its Meandrings finde the Center out? Can Infinite be measur'd by a Span? And what art thou, lesse than all these, ô Man? Man is a thing of nought! yet from Above There beams upon his Soul such Raies of Love, As may discover by Faiths Optick, where The burning Bush is, though not see Him there. The meekest Man on Earth did only see His Shadow shining there, it was not He. And if that great Soul, who with holy Flame, And ravisht Spirit to the Third Heav'n came, Saw Things unutterable, What can We Expresse of those Things that we ne're did see? The Senses strongest Pillars cannot bear The Weight of the least grain of Glory there. No more then where to bound, or comprehend Infinitie, they can Begin, or End. Since then the Soul is circumscrib'd within The narrow Limits of a tender Skin; Let us be Babes in Innocence, and grow Strong upwards, and more weak to things below. By sacred Chymistrie, the Spirit must Ascend and leave the Sediment to Dust. This Cordial is distilled from the Eyes, And we must sprinkle it on th' Sacrifice: Offered i'th Virtue of Theoph'las Name, Which must be to it Holocaust and Flame. Then, wing'd with Zeal, we may aspire to see The hallow'd Oracles exprest by Thee, Who art Loves Flamen, and with Holy Fire Refin'st thy Muse, to make her mount the Higher. ARTH. WILSON. For the Renowned COMPOSER. A Poets Ashes need nor Brass, nor Stone To be their Ward-robe; Since his Name alone Shall stand both Brass and Marble to the Tomb. Nor doth he want the Cere-cloths balmy Womb T' enwrap his Dust, until his drowzie Clay Again enliv'ned by an active Ray, Shot from the last Day's Fire, shall wake, and rise, Attir'd with Light. No; When a Poet dies, His Sheets alone winde up his Earth, They'l be Instead of Mourner, Tomb, and Obsequie; And to embalm It, his own Ink he takes: Gumme Arabick the richest Mummy makes. Then, Sir, You need no Obelisk, that may Seclude your Ashes from Plebeian Clay. For, from your Mine of Fancie, now we see Y' have digg'd so many Jems of Poesie, That out of them you raise a glorious Shrine, In which your ever-blooming Name will shine; Free from th' Eclipse of Age, and Clouds of Rust, Which are the Moths to other common Dust. Then, could we now collect th' all worshipt Oar, With which kinde Nature paves the Indian Shore; And gather to one masse that Stock of Spice, Which copies out afresh old Paradise, And in the Phœnix od'rous Nest is pent, All would fall short of This rich Monument. About the Surface of whose Verge, You stick So many fragrant Flow'rs of Rhetorick, That Lovers shall approach in Throngs, and seek With their rich Leaves t' adorn each Beauties Cheek; So that, these sacred Trophies will become In After-times your Altar, not your Tomb. To which the Poets shall in well-drest Laies, Offer their Victimes, with a Grove of Bayes. For here among these Leaves, no speckled Snake, Or Viper doth his Bed of Venom make: No Lust-burnt Goat, nor looser Satyr weaves His Cabin out, among these spotlesse Leaves. A Virgin here may safely dart her Eye, And yet not blush for Fear, lest any by Should see Her read. These Pages do dispence A Julep, which so charms the Itch of Sense, That we are forc't to think your guiltlesse Quill Did, with its Ink, the Turtles Blood distill. T. Philipot. Qui Virtutes Theohilæ prædicat, Religioni non Gloriæ studeat. Noverim Te, DOMINE, noverim me! Ore-come me not with your Perfumes, ô Friends! My greatest Worth, to shew I'm nothing, tends. Praise, wait on Heav'n. Th' Host of an humble Heart Excells the sacred Hecatombs of Art. Grant, LORD, my Life may parallel my Layes! They me too much, I Thee too little, praise. ON DIVINE POETS. A hallow'd Poets Muse is Th' Holy Dove. Parnassus th' Empyræan Height Above. His lofty-soaring Pegasus Christs Love. Heav'ns Shoure of Grace is his Castalian Spring. A Seraphin lends Pen from his own Wing. His Ink is of the best LAMBS purple Die. To Him Heav'ns Sphere is a vast Librarie. Rais'd by th' Advantage of th' Eternal Book, His piercing Eye ev'n into Heav'n does look. O, what Endeavors can more fruitful be! What Comforts can we more delightful see! By which the Poet we an Angel deem; Yea, GOD to's sacred Muse does Patron seem. Ergo brevi stringam Coelestia Cantu. Alming to profit as to please, We bring No usual Hawk to try her Wing. Come, come Theoph'la, fresh as May: Hark how the Falkner lures! This is Loves Holy-Day. Her stretch is for Devotions Quarrie, which Mounts up her Zeal to Eagle-pitch: Cheer Thou her present tim'rous Flight, Whil'st She thus cuts with Wing the driving Rack of Height. From thence, 'bove sparkling Stars, She'l spritely move, Her Plumes of Faith being prun'd by Love. As Grace shall ymp her Pineon, more, Or less, she will, or flag, or 'bove what's mortal, soar. [The Author musing here survay] This poem appears under the frontispiece to Canto I. The Author musing here survay, How He may THEOPHIL portray: Where Others Art surpast you find, They draw the Body, HE the Mind. The World's beneath his Foot; while SHEE HEAV'N, by the Heav'nly Sphere, does see. A Crown is reacht HER from the SKIES, Vp with his Book an Eagle flies. THEOPHILA OR LOVES SACRIFICE. A Divine Poem. THE PRELIBATION To the SACRIFICE. CANTO I. ARGUMENT. Spes alit occiduas qui Sublunaribus hæret; Rivales JESUS non in Amore sinit. Quid mihi non sapiat Terrâ, mihi dum sapit Æther? Sed sapiet, sapias nî mihi, CHRISTE, nihil. Awake, Arise, Loves Steersman, and first tast Delight; Sound That; ere Anchor's cast On Joy; stere hence a pray'rful Course to Heav'n at last. I Might Souls converse with Souls, by Angel-way, Enfranchis'd from their pris'ning Clay, What Strain by Intuition, would They then convay! II But, Spirits, sublim'd too fast, evap'rate may, Without some interpos'd Allay; And Notions, subtiliz'd too thin, exhale away. III The Gold (Sols Child) when in Earths Womb it lay As precious was, though not so gay, As, when refin'd, it doth It self abroad display. IV Mount, Fancie, then through Orbs to Glories Sphere; (Wilde is the Course that ends not there:) You, who are Virtues Friends, lend to her Tongue an Ear. V Let not the wanton Love-fights, which may rise From vocal Fifes, Flame-darting Eyes, (Beauties Munition) Hearts w?? Wounds unseen surprize: VI Whose Basilisk-like Glances taint the Air Of Virgin purenesse, and ensnare Entangled Thoughts i'th' Trammels of their Ambush-hair. VII Loves Captive view, who's Daies in warm Frosts spends; On's Idol dotes, to Wit pretends; Writes, blots, &amp; rends; nor heeds where he begins or ends. VIII His Stock of Verse in Comick Fragments lies: Higher than Ten'riffs Pique He flies: Sols but a spark; Thou outray'st all Diamonds of the Skies. IX Victorious Flames glow from thy brighter Eye; Cloud those twin-lightning Orbs (They'l frie An ice-vein'd Monk) cloud Them, or, Planet-struck, I die. X Indians, pierce Rocks for Gems; Negro's, the Brine For Pearls; Tartars, to hunt combine For Sables; Consecrate all Off'rings at Her Shrine. XI Crouch low.—O, Vermeil-tinctur'd Cheek! for, thence The Organs to my Optick Sense Are dazled at the Blaze of so bright Angelence. XII Does Troy-bane Hellen (Friend) with Angels share? All Lawlesse Passions Idols are: Frequent are fuco'd Cheeks; The Virtuosa's rare: XIII A Truth authentick. Let not skin-deep white And red, perplex the nobler Light O'th' Intellect; nor mask the Souls clear piercing Sight. XIV Burn Odes, Lusts Paperplots; Fly Playes, its Flame; Shun guileful Courtisms; Forge for Shame No Chains; Lip-traffick, and Eye-dialogues disclaim. XV Hark how the frothy, empty Heads within Roar and carouse i'th' jovial Sin, Amidst the wilde Levalto's on their merry Pin! XVI Drain dry the ransackt Cellars, and resign Your Reason up to Riot, joyn Your Fleet, &amp; sail by sugar-rocks through Floods of Wine: XVII Send Care to dead Sea of Phlegmattick Age; Ride without Bit your restive Rage; And act your Revel-rout Thus on the tipling Stage. XVIII Swell us a lustie Brimmer,—more,—till most; So Vast, that none may spie the Coast: Wee'l down with All, though therein sail'd Lepanto's Host: XIX Top and Top-gallant hoise; We will out-rore The bellowing Storms, though shipwrackt more Healths are, than tempting'st Syrens did inchant of yore XX Each Gallon breeds a Ruby;—Drawer, score 'um; Cheeks dy'd in Claret seem o'th' Quorum, When our Nose-carbuncles, like Link-boyes, blaze before'um. XXI Such are their Ranting Catches to unsoul, And out-law Man; They stagger, rowl, Their feet indent, their Sense being drunk with Circes Bowl. XXII Intombed Souls! Why rot ye thus alive, Melting your Salt to Lees? and strive To strangle Nature, and hatch Death? Healths, Health deprive. XXIII The sinlesse Herd loaths your Sense-stifling Streams, When long Spits point your Tale: Ye Breams In Wine and Sleep, your Princes are but Fumes, and Dreams. XXIV I'd rather be preserv'd in Brine, than rot In Nectar. Now to Dice they're got: Their Tables snare in both; Then what can be their Shot? XXV Yet Blades will throw at All, sans Fear, or Wit; Oaths black the Night when Dice do'nt hit; When Winners lose at Play, can Losers win by it? XXVI Egypts Spermatick Nurse, when her spread Floor Is flow'd 'bove sev'nteen Cubits ore, Breeds Dearth: And Spend-thrifts waste, when they enflame the Score. XXVII Tell me, ye pybald Butterflies, who poise Extrinsick with intrinsick Joyes; What gain ye from such short-liv'd, fruitless, empty Toys? XXVIII Ye Fools, who barter Gold for Trash, report, Can Fire in Pictures warm? Can Sport That stings, the mock-sense fill? How low's your Heav'n! how short! XXIX Go, chaffer Blisse for Pleasure, which is had More by the Beast, than Man; the Bad Swim in their Mirth: (CHRIST wept, nere laught) The Best are sad. XXX Brutes covet nought but what's terrene; Heav'ns Quire Do in eternal Joyes conspire; Man 'twixt them Both does intermediate Things desire. XXXI Had we no Bodies, we were Angels; and Had we no Souls, we were unmann'd To Beasts: Brutes are all Flesh, all Spirit the Heav'nly Band. XXXII At first GOD made them One thus, by subjecting The Sense to Reason; and directing The Appetite by th' Spirit: But Sin by infecting XXXIII Mans free-born Will, so shatters Them; that They At present nor cohabite may Without Regret, nor without Grief depart away. XXXIV Go, cheating World, that dancest ore thy Thorns; Lov'st what undoes; hat'st what adorns: Go, idolize thy Vice, and Virtue load with Scorns. XXXV Thy luscious Cup, more deadly then Asps Gall, Empoys'neth Souls for Hell: Thou all Times Mortalls dost enchant with thy delusive Call. XXXVI Who steals from Time, Time steals from him the Prey: Pastimes passe Time, passe Heav'n away: Few like the blessed Thief do steal Salvations Day. XXXVII Fools rifle Times rich Lott'rie: Who mispend Lifes peerlesse Gemme, alive descend; And Antidate with Stings their never-ending End. XXXVIII Whose vast Desires engrosse the boundlesse Land By Fraud, or Force; Like Spiders stand, Squeezing small Flies; Such are their Nets, &amp; such their Hand. XXXIX When Nimrods Vulture-Talons par'd shall be, Their Houses Name soon chang'd you'l see; For their Bethesda shall be turn'd to Bethanie. XL Better destroy'd by Law, than rul'd by Will; What Salves can cure, if Balsams kill? That Good is worst that does degenerate to Ill. XLI Had not GOD left the Best within the Power Of Persecutors, who devoure; We had nor Martyrs had, nor yet a SAVIOUR. XLII Saints melt as Wax, Fools-clay grows hard at Cries Of that scarce-breathing Corse, who lies With dry Teeth, meager Cheeks, thin Maw, &amp; hollow Eyes. XLIII GOD made Life; Give't to Man; By opening Veins, Death's sluc'd out, and Pleuretick Pains: Make GOD thy Pattern, Cure thy self, Alms are best gains. XLIV Heav'ns Glorie to atchieve, what scantling Span Hath the frail Pilgrimage of Man! Which sets, when risen; ends, when it but now began. XLV Who fight with outward Lusts, win inward Peace; Judgements against Self-Judges cease: Who face their Cloaks with Zeal do but their Woes increase. XLVI The Mighty, mighty Torments shall endure, If impious: Hell admits no Cure. The best Securitie is ne're to be secure. XLVII Oaks, that dare grapple with Heav'ns Thunder sink All shiver'd; Coals that scorch do shrink To Ashes; Vap'ring Snuffs expire in noysom Stink. XLVIII Time, strip the writhel'd Witch; Pluck the black Bags From off Sins grizly Scalp; the Hags Plague-sores shew then more loathsom than her leprous Rags. XLIX 'Twas She slew guiltlesse Naboth; 'twas she curl'd The painted Jezabel; she hurl'd Realms from their Center; She unhing'd the new-fram'd World. L Blest then who shall her dash 'gainst Rocks; (her Grones, Our Mirth) and wash the bloody Stones With her own cursed Gore; repave them with her Bones. LI By Salique Law She should not reign: Storms swell By her, which Halcyon Dayes dispell: Nought's left that's good where she in Souls possest does dwell. LII 'Twas her Excesse bred Plagues! Infecting Stars, Infesting Dearth, Intestine Wars Surfeit with Graves the Earth, 'mongst Living making Jars. LIII My Soul, enlabyrinth'd in Grief, spend Years In Sackcloth, chamleted with Tears, Retir'd to Rocks dark entrals, court unwitnest Fears. LIV There passe with Heraclite a gentler Age, Free from the sad Account of Rage, That acts the toilsome World on its tumultuous Stage. LV There sweet Religion strings, and tunes, and skrues The Souls Theorb', and doth infuse Grave Dorick Epods in th' Enthusiastick Muse. LVI There Love turns trumpets into Harps, which call Off Sieges from the gun-shot Wall; Alluring them to Heav'n, her Seat Imperial. LVII Thence came our Joy, and Thence Hymns eas'd our Grief; Of which th' Angelical was chief; Glory to GOD; Earth Peace; Good Will for Mans Relief. LVIII Quills, pluckt from Venus Doves, impresse but shame: Then, give your Rimes to Vulcans Flame; Hee'l elevate your badger Feet: He's free, though lame. LIX Things fall, and Nothings rise! Old Virtue fram'd Honour for Wisdom: Wisdom fam'd Old Virtue: Such Times were! Wealth then Arts Page was nam'd LX Lambeth was Oxfords Whetstone: Yet above Preferments Pinnacle they move, Who string the Universe, and bracelet It for Love. LXI Virtues magnifick Orb inflames their Zeal; By high-rais'd Anthems Plagues they heal; And threefork'd Thunders in Heavns outstretcht Arm repeal. LXII Shall Larks with shrill-chirpt Mattens rouze from Bed Of curtain'd Night Sols orient Head? And shall quick Souls lie numb'd, as wrapt in Sheets of Lead? LXIII Awake from slumbring Lethargie; The gay And circling Charioter of Day, In's Progress through the azure Fields sees, checks our Stay. LXIV Arise; and rising, emulate the rare Industrious Spinsters, who with fair Embroid'ries checker-work the Chambers of the Air LXV Ascend; Sol does on Hills his Gold display, And, scatt'ring Sweets, does spice the Day, And shoots delight through Nature with each arrow'd Ray. LXVI The Opal-colour'd Dawns raise Fancie high; Hymns ravish those who Pulpets fly; Convert dull Lead to active Gold by Love-chymie. LXVII As Natures prime Confectioner, the Bee, By her Flow'r-nibling Chymistrie, Turns Vert to Or: So, Verse gross Prose does rarifie. LXVIII Pow'rs cannot Poets, as They Pow'rs up-buoy; Whose Soul-enliv'ning Charms Decoy Each wrinkled Care to the Pacifick Sea of Joy. LXIX As, where from Jewels sparkling Lustre darts, Those Rayes enstarre the duskie Parts: So, Beams of Poesie give Light, Life, Soul to Arts. LXX Rich Poesie! Thy more irradiant Gems Give Splendor unto Diadems, And with coruscant Rayes emblazest Honours Stems. LXXI Thee Muse (Arts ambient Air, Inventions Door, The Stage of Wits) both Rich and Poor Do court.—A Prince may glory to become thy Wooer. LXXII Poets ly 'entomb'd by Kings. Arts Gums dispence; By Rumination bruis'd, are thence By Verse so fir'd, that their Perfume Enheav'ns the Sense. LXXIII Its The'ory makes All wiser, yet Few better; Practise is Spirit, Art the Letter; Use artlesse doth enlarge, Art uselesse does but fetter. LXXIV Sharp Sentences are Goads to make Deeds go; Good Works are Males, Words Females show: Whose Lives act Presidents, prevent the Laws, and Do. LXXV So far We know, as we obey GOD; and He counts We leave not his Command, When as our Interludes but 'twixt our Acts do stand. LXXVI Honours brave Soul is in that Body shrin'd, Which floats not with each giddy Winde, (Fickle as Courtly Dress) but Wisdoms Sea does find: LXXVII Steering by Graces Pole-star, which is fast In th' Apostollick Zodiack plac't, Whose Course at first four Evangelick Pilots trac't: LXXVIII The Theanthropick Word; That mystick Glasse Of Revelations; That masse Of Oracles; That Fu'el of Pray'r; That Wall of Brass; LXXIX That Print of Heav'n on Earth; That Mercies Treasure, And Key; That Evidence, and Seisure; Faiths Card, Hopes Anchor; Loves full Sail; Abyss of Pleasure. LXXX Such Saints high Tides n'ere ebbe so low, to shelf Them on the Quicksand of their self- Swallowing Corruption: Sin's the Wrack, They fly that Elf. LXXXI Gloomier than West of Death; than North of Night; Than Nest of Triduan Blacks, with Fright Which Egypt scar'd, when He brought Darkness, Who made Light. LXXXII Compar'd to whose Storm, thund'ring Peals are calm: Compar'd to whose Sting, Asps yield Balm: Compar'd to whose loath'd Charm, Death is a Mercy-Psalm. LXXXIII Her Snares escap'd, soar, Muse, to Him, whose bright Spirit-illuminating Sight Turns Damps to glorious Dayes; turns Fogs to radiant Light. LXXXIV Religion's Wisdoms Study; That display, LORD, countermand what goes astray; And smite the Ass (rude Flesh) when it does start or bray. LXXXV Soul, thou art lesse than Mercies least; Three ne're Depart from Sin; Shame, Guilt, and Fear: Fear, Shame, Guilt, Sin, are Four; Yet All in One appear. LXXXVI Crest-faln by Sin, how wretchedly I stray! Me thinks 'tis Pride in me to pray: Heav'n aid me strugling under this sad Load of Clay. LXXXVII No Man may merit, yet did One, we hold; Who most do vant their Zeal, are cold: Thus Tin for Silver goes with these, and Brasse for Gold. LXXXVIII Renew my Heart, direct my Tongue; unseal My Hand, inspire my Faith, reveal My Hope, encrease my Love, and my Backslidings heal! LXXXIX Let Language (Mans choice Glory) serve the Minde: Thy Spirit on Bezaliel shin'd: Help, Bloud, by Faith apply'd! Thy Spittle cur'd the Blinde. XC Turn Sense to Spirit; Nature's chang'd alone By Grace; That is the Chymick-stone: And thy all-pow'rful Word is pure Projection; XCI Truths Touchstone, surest Rule that ere was fra'md, (Tradition, Mans dark Map, 's disclaim'd) The Paper burns me not, yet I am all inflam'd: XCII For, as I read, such inward Splendor glowes; Such Life-renewing Vigour flowes, That All, what's known of thy most righteous Will, It showes: XCIII Whose Spells make Enochs walk with Thee; withhold Corruption, and translate e're old: All Vaticans are drosse; This, Magisterial Gold. XCIV Thus, poor numm'd Tartars, when th' are brought into Warm Persias Gem-pav'd Court, are so Reviv'd, that then They live; till then half dead w?? Snow. XCV Good Thoughts from Thee infus'd I do derive; Good Words effus'd Thou dost me give; Good Works diffus'd by Thee, in Thee do live, &amp; thrive. XCVI Nerve-stretching Muse, thy Bow's new strung; shoot then Hymns to the BEST, from worst of Men; Make Arts thy Tributaries, twist Heart, Tongue, &amp; Pen. XCVII But how can Eves degenerate Issue, bent To Sin, in its weak Measures vent. Thy Praise? Unmeasurable! and Omnipotent! XCVIII Shrubs cannot Cedars, nor Wrens Eagles praise; Nor purblinde Owls on Sols Orb gaze: What is a drop to Seas, a Beam to boundlesse Raies? XCIX Yet Hope, and Love may raise my drooping Flight; And Faith in Thee embeam my Night: Great Love, supply Faiths Nerves, with winged Hope—i write. My Spirit, LORD, my Soul, my Bodie, all My Thoughts, Words, Works hereafter shall Praise THEE, and Sin bemone. JESU, how lov'dst THOU me! Me blessed, thy LOVE make! Me raised, Thy LOVE take! JESU, my pretious ONE! May This, LOVES OFFERING be. My Heart, Tongue, Eye, Hand, bowed knee, As All came from, let All return to THEE! Nunc sacra primus habet Finem, mea Cura, Libellus; Jàm precor impellat sanctior Aura ratem! I felix, rapidas diffindas Cærula Syrtes; Te Divina regit Dextera; Sospes abi. NON NOBIS DOMINE. Canto II The Humiliation The Summary of the Poem. Theophila, or Divine Love, ascends to her Belov'd by three Degrees. By Humilitie, by Zeal, by Contemplation. In the First She is Sincere, In the Second Fervent, In the Third Extatical. In her Humiliation She sadly condoles her Sin, in her Devotion She improves her Grace, In her Meditation She antidates her Glory, and triumphantly congratulates the Fruition of her Spouse. And by three Wayes, which Divines call the Purgative, Illuminative, and Unitive; She is happily led into the Disquisition of Sin by Man; of Suffering by CRIST as Sponsor; of Salvation, by Him as REDEEMER. In the Purgative Way she falls upon Repentance, Mortification, Self-denial; helpt in part by the Knowledge of herself, which breeds Contrition, Renuntiation, and Purpose of Amendment: In the Illuminative she pursues Moral Vertues, Theological Graces, and Gospel-promises, revealed by CHRIST, as the Great Apostle, which begets in her Gratitude, Imitation and, Appropriation. In the Unitive she is wholly taken up with Intuition of supercœlestial Excellencies, with beatifical Apprehensions, and Adherencies, as to CHRIST in Bodie, to the Holy GHOST in Spirit, to GOD the FATHER in a bright Resemblance of the Divine Nature. All which are felt by the Knowledg of CHRIST as Mediator; whence flow Admiration, Elevation, consummated in Glorification. And were Mysteriously intimated in the Symbolical Oblations of the Star-led Sophies, Who, by their Myrrhe, signify'd Faith, Chastity, Mortification, the Purgative Actions; by their Incense implied Hope, Prayer, Obedience, the Illuminative Devotions; by their Gold importing Charity, Satiety, Radiancie, the Unitive Eminencies: And it is the only Ambition of Theophila to offer these presents to her Belov'd; by whom her Sin is purged, her Understanding enlightned, her Will and Affections enflamed to the Communion of all his Glories. Thus, She by recollecting past Creation, present Corruption, and future Beatifical Vision, endeavors to rowze us up from Hellish Security, Worldly Solicitude, and Carnal Concupiscence, that being rais'd, we may conform to the will, submit to the Power, and sympathize with the Spirit of CHRIST, by a total Resignation of Self-comforts, Abilities, Ends; and by the internal Acts of Love, Devotion, Contemplation, She makes Sense subservient to Reason, Reason to Faith, and Faith to the written Word. By Faith she beleeves what he has reveal'd, and yields him up all her Understanding: By Hope She waits for his Promises, and refers to Him all her Will. By Charity she Loves his Excellencies, and resignes to him all her Affections. And by all these She triumphs over Sin, Death, Hell, in the sensual World, and by his Virtue, Grace, Favour, enjoyes an eminent Degree of Perfection in the Intellectual. ARGUMENT. Unde superbit Homo? cujus Conceptio, Culpa; Nasci, Pœna; Labor, Vita; necesse mori. Totus homo pravus; Caro, Mens, Natura, Voluntas; Cœlicus ast Hominis Crimina tollit Amor. The Deiform'd Soul deform'd by Sin, repents; In Pray'rs and Tears, her Grief She vents, And, till Faith cheer her by CHISTS Love, Life, Death, laments. I Almighty Power, Who did'st All Souls Create; Who did'st Redeem their faln Estate; Who still dost Sanctifie, and them Redintegrate. II Sourse, River, Ocean of all Blisse, instill Spring-tides into my low-ebb'd Quill: Each graceful Work flowes from (what works all Grace) Thy Will. III LORD! Thou, before Time, Matter, Form, or Place, Wast All; E're Natures mortal Race: Thy Self, Host, Guest, and Palace, Natures total Space. IV When yet (though not discern'd) in that Abysse Creator, Word, and Spirit of Blisse, In Unity the Trine, one GOD, adored is. V E're Thou the Chrystal-mantled Heav'n didst rear, Or did the Earth, Sols Bride, appear, First Race of Intellectuals mad'st, Thee to revere. VI Praise best doth Inexpressibles expresse: Soul, Th' Architect of Wonders blesse; Whose All-creating Word embirth'd a Nothingnesse. VII Who brooding on the Deep, Production Dispos'd, then call'd out Light, which on The formless Worlds rude Face was all dispers'dly thrown. VIII When callow Nature, pluckt from out her Nest Of Causes, was awak'd from Rest, Her shapeless Lump with fledg'd effects He trimly drest. IX Then new-born Day He gilt with glittering Sun (Contracted Light); with changing Moon He Night adorn'd, and hung up Lamps, like spangled Bullion. X The Earth, with Water mixt, He separates: Earth Plants brought forth, and Beasts All Mates; The Waters Fowl, and Fish to yield Man delicates. XI Then did of th' El'ements Dust Mans Bodie frame A perfect Microcosm, the Same He quickned with a sparkle of Pneumatick Flame. XII More Heav'nly specify'd by Life from th' Word; That, Nature doth, This, Grace afford; And Glory from the Spirit design'd, as threefold Cord. XIII Man, ere a Childe; by Infusion wise; though He Was of, yet not for Earth, though free Chanc'lour install'd of Edens Universitie. XIV His Virgin-Sister-Wife i'th Grove He woo'd, (Heav'ns Nursery); new Fruit his Food, Skin was his Robe: Clouds washt, Winds swept his Floor. All good. XV Envie, that GOD should so love Man, first mov'd Satan, to ruine Heav'ns Belov'd: The Serpent Devil'd Eve, She's Dam to Adam prov'd. XVI Both taste, by tasting, tastlesse Both became; Who All would know, knew nought but Shame: They blush for That which They, when righteous, could not name. XVII Still in our Maw that Apples Core doth stick, Which they did swallow, and the thick Rinde of forbidden Fruit has left our Nature sick. XVIII Now serves our Guiltiness, as winding Sheet, To wrap up Lepers; Cover meet; While thus stern Vengeance does our Wormships sadly greet. XIX Disloyal Slaves, look out, see, Mischief revels; Look in, see your own Denne of Evils; Look up; see Heav'ns dread Judge; Look down, see Hells fierce Devils. XX Created in GODS Image to look high; Corrupted, like to Brutes, you lie: Perdition's from your selves: No Cure for those will die. XXI Your Beautie, Rottenness skin'd o're, does show Like to a Dunghill, blancht with Snow, Your glorious Nature's by embasing Sin brought low. XXII Hence you the heavy Doom of Death do gain, Enforc'd unto laborious Pain; And th' Angels flaming Sword doth you, expuls'd, restrain. XXIII Thus She reproacht; Yet more (alas) remain'd; Mans Issue in his Loins is staind: Sin set his Throne in Him, and since o're all has reign'd. XXIV Black Sin! more hideous then green Dragons Claws, Dun Gryphons Talons, swart Bears Paws, Then checquer'd Panthers Teeth, or tawnie Lions Jaws. XXV Forfeit to the Creator's thus Mans Race, And by the Word withdrawn is Grace, From him the Spirit of Glory turn'd his pleasing Face. XXVI Yet that this Second Race, in fallen Plight, Might not with th' First be ruin'd quite, The Word doth interpose to stop th' incensed Might. XXVII Then undertakes for Man to satisfie, And the sad losse of Grace supply, That us He might advance to Glories Hierarchie. XXVIII Then Peace is preacht ith' Womans Seed; but then As Men increase; So, Sins of Men, And Actual on Original heapt, GOD's vext agen. XXIX Till drencht they were in Deluge, had no Shore; And burnt in Sodom-Flames, of yore; Plagued in Egypt, plung'd into the Gulf of Core. XXX And gnawn by Worms in Herod: Sin's Asps Womb, Plotter, Thief, Plaintiff, Witnesse, Doom, Sledge, Executioner, Hells Inmate, Horrors Tomb. XXXI Misgotten Brat! thy Trains are infinite To ruine each intangled Wight: Mischiefs nere rest in Men, th' have everlasting Spite. XXXII Spite wageth War, then War turns Law to Lust; Lust crumbles Faith into Distrust; Distrust by causelesse Jealousie betrayes the Just; XXXIII The Just are plunder'd by thy Rage; thy Rage Bubbleth from Envie; Envie's Page To thy Misdeeds; Misdeeds their own Misfate engage. XXXIV Thus linkt to Hell's thy Chain! Curs'd be that Need Makes Sinners in their Sins proceed: Shame, to Guilts forlorn Hope, leads left-hand Files.—Take heed. XXXV GODS Fort (the Conscience) in the worst does stand; Though Sin the Town keeps by strong Hand, Yet lies it open to the Check at Heav'ns Command. XXXVI Hence Hell surrounds them: In their Dreams to fall Headlong they seem, then start, groan, crawl From Furies, with excessive Frights which them appal. XXXVII Ne're was more Mischief, ne're was less Remorse; Never Revenge on his black Horse Did swifter ride; Never to GOD so slow Recourse! XXXVIII The Age-bow'd Earth groans under Sinners Weight; While guiltlesse Blood cries to Heav'ns Height, Justice soon takes th' Alarm, whose steeled Arm will smite. XXXIX Inevitable Woes a while may stay, Vengeance is GODS, Who will repay The desperately Wilfull, nor will long delay. XL 'Tis darkest neer Day-break. He will o'return Th' Implacable, who Mercie spurn; Superlative Abuses in th' Abysse shall burn. XLI Deaths Hell Deaths Self out-deaths! Vindictive Place! Deep under Depths! Excentrick Space! Horrour It self, than Thee, wears a lesse horrid Face! XLII Where Pride, Lust, Rage, (Sin treble-pointed) dwell; Shackled in red-hot Chains they yell In bottomlesse Extreams of never-slaking Hell! XLIII Riddle! Compell'd, at once, to live and die! Frying they freez, and freezing frie! On helplesse, hopelesse, easelesse, endlesse Racks they lie! XLIV And rave for what they hate! Cursing in vain, Yet each Curse is a Pray'r for Pain, For, cursing still their Woe, they woo GODS Curse again! XLV Devils and Shreeks their Ears, their Eyes affright! There's blazing Fire, yet darkest Night! Still paying, ne're discharg'd. Sins Debt is Infinite! XLVI Angels by one Sin fell; So, Man: How then May Sinners stand! Let's quit Sins Den: This Moment's Ours; Life hasts away; Delayes gangrene. XLVII Conviction ushers Grace; Fall to prevent Thy Fall, Times Fore-lock take; Relent. Shall is to come; and Was is past; then, Now repent. XLVIII Before the Suns long Shadows span up Night; E're on thy shaking Head Snowes light; E're round thy palsy'd Heart Ice be congealed quite; XLIX E're in thy Pocket thou thine Eyes dost wear; E're thy Bones serve for Calender; E're in thy Hand's thy Leg, or Silver in thy Hair; L Preventing Physick use. Think, now ye hear The Dead-awakening Trump; Lo, there The queazie-stomackt Graves disgorge Worms fatning Chear. LI Sins Sergeants wait t' attach you; Then, make haste, Lest you into Despair be cast: The JUDGE unsway'd: Take Dayes at best, count each your Last. LII Time posts on loose-rein'd Steeds. The Sun ere't face To West, may see Thee end thy Race: Death is a Noun, yet not declin'd in any Case. LIII The Cradle's nigh the Tomb. That Soul has Woe, Whose drowzie March to Heav'n is slow, As drawling Snails, whose slime glues them to Things below. LIV Anathema to luke-warm Souls.—Lo, here Theophila's unhing'd with Fear, Clamm'd with chill sweat, when as her ranckling Sins appear. LV Perplext in Crimes meandring Maze, GODS Law, And Guilt, that does strict Judgement draw, And her too carnal, yet too stonie Heart She saw. LVI Yet Rocks may cleave (she cries.) Then, weeps for Tears, And grieves for Grief; fears want of Fears; She Hell, Heav'ns Prison, views; Distress, for Robe, She wears. LVII Deprav'd by Vice, depriv'd of Grace; with Pray'r, She runs Faiths Course; breaks through Despair, O'retakes Hope. Broken Legs by setting stronger are. LVIII Shame, native Conscience, views That Holy One, Who came from GOD to Man undone, Whose Birth produc'd a Star, Whose Death eclips't the Sun. LIX She sees Earth-Heav'n, Flesh-Spirit, Man-God in Stamp Of Him, who shakes, but does not cramp The bruised Reed; Snuffs puts not out the sputtring Lamp. LX She sees for Creatures the Creator came To die; The Shepherd prov'd the Lamb For Sacrifice, when Jews releas'd a spotted Ram. LXI She sees defamed Glory, wronged Right, Debased Majestie, crusht Might, Virtue condemn'd, Peace robb'd, Love slain! And All by Spite. LXII She, streaming, sees, like Spouts, each broached Vein With Gore, not to be matcht again! Her Grief thence draws up Mysts to fall in weeping Rain. LXIII Vast Cares, long dumb, thus vent. Flow Tears, Souls Wine, Juice of an Heart opprest; Encline, LORD, to this heart-broke Altar cemented with Brine! LXIV Remorsefull Clouds, dissolve in Showr's; 'Tis Blood Turns rocky Hearts into a Flood: Eyes, keep your Sluces ope; Heav'n best by Tears is woo'd. LXV Thou, Who one Shoarless Sea of All did'st make, Except one floating Isle, to take Vengeance on Guilt; My Salt Flood rais'd, drown Sin i'th' Lake. LXVI O, how these Words, Arise to Judgement quell! On Wheels in Torments broke I'd dwell, So as by Grace I might be sav'd from endlesse Hell. LXVII To Angel-Intercessor, I'm forbid To pray; Yet pray to One that did Pray to Another for Himself when's Blood-drops slid. LXVIII Father! Perfections Self in CHRIST does shine; Thy Justice then in Him confine; Through's Merits, make thy Mercies, both are endless, mine! LXIX See not, but through's abstersive Blood, my Sin; By which I being cleans'd within, Adde Perseverance. 'Tis as hard to hold, as win. LXX Her Eyes are Centinels to Pray'r, to Moans Her Ears, her Nose courts Charnel-bones; Her Hands Breast-hammers are, her constant Food is Groans. LXXI Her Heart is hung with Blacks, with Dust she cloyes Her golden Tresses; Weds Annoyes, Breeds Sighs, bears Grief, which, Ibis-like, Sin-snakes destroyes. LXXII Thus mounts she drizling Olivet; the Plains Of Jericho she leaves. (While Rains The Farmer wet, they fully swell his earing Graines.) LXXIII She, her own Farmer, stockt from Heav'n, is bent To thrive; Care 'bout the Pay-day's spent. Stange! She alone is Farmer, Farm, and Stock, and Rent. LXXIV The Porcupine so's Quiver, Bow, and Darts To' herself alone; has all Wars Arts; Her own Artillery needs no Aid from forreign Parts. LXXV Sad Votaresse! thy Earth, of late oregrown With Weeds, is plough'd, till'd harrow'd, sown. The Seed of Grace sprouts up when Nature is kept down. LXXVI Thy Glebe is melow'd with Faith-quickning Juice; The Furrows thence Hope-blades produce; Thy Valley cloth'd with Love will Harvest Joyes diffuse. LXXVII Live, Phenix, from Self-death. I'th' Morn who dies To Sin, does but immortalize: Who studie Death, ere dead, ere th' Resurrection rise. LXXVIII Rachel! thy Children Goal and Crown have won, Ere they had Skill or Will to run. Blest, who their whole Dayes Work in their Lifes Morn have done. LXXIX Like misty Morn, She rose in Dew; so found She ne're was, till this Sicknesse, sound; Till Sin, in Sorrows flowing Issue (Tears) lay drownd. LXXX Souls Life-blood Tears, prevailing Pleaders, tame Such Rebels, as by Eve did shame Mans Glory; only These the old faln World new frame. LXXXI Lust causeth Sin, Sin Shame, Shame bids repent, Repentance weeps, Tears Sorrow vent, Sorrow shews Faith, Faith Hope, Hope Love, Love Souls Content. LXXXII Thus, from bruis'd Spiceries of her Breast, doth rise Incense, sweet-smelling Sacrifice: Whilst she lifts up to Heav'n, her Heart, her Hand, her Eyes. LXXXIII I'm sick with trembling, sunk with mourning, blasted With sinning, and with sighing wasted; New Life begins to breath; O, Joy, too long untasted! LXXXIV Twice did'st new Life (by Breath, by Death) bestow On Man prevaricating, Who, By yielding to a Woman, made Man yield to Woe. LXXXV Then did'st his Soul restore (as first inspire) With second Grace, renewing Fire; Whence He hath part again in thy Cœlestial Quire. LXXXVI Once more for this Heav'n-Denison did'st get A never-fading Coronet, Which was with two bright Jewels, Grace and Glory, set. LXXXVII 'Twas at my bloud-stain'd Birth Thy Love said, Live: Links of Thy prævious Chain revive Ev'n crumbled Dust: So, Thou my Soul from Death reprive! LXXXVIII CHRIST, Th' Unction art, Salvation JESUS; in Thy Death Redemption, Blood for Sin Gives Satisfaction, Thy Ascension Hope does winne; LXXXIX Thy Session Comfort. Though I did offend, LORD, Fears disband, give Grace t' amend, That, Hope, which reaps not shame, may rise, &amp; Peace descend. XC My Pardon signe. The Spear pierct Thee's the Pen, Thy Bloud the Ink, Thy Gospel then The Standish is, O, let my Soul be Paper clean! XCI Kinde, angry LORD, since Thou dost wound, yet cure; I'l bear the Yoak, the Crosse endure; Lament, and Love; and, when set free, keep Conscience pure. XCII Thus mourns she, and, in mourning thus, she joyes; Ev'n that adds Comfort, which annoyes; Sighs turn to Songs, &amp; Tears to Wine, Fear Fear destroies. XCIII As holy Flame did from her Heart arise, Dropt holy Water from her Eyes, While Pray'r her Incense was, &amp; Love her Sacrifice. XCIV Arm! Arm! She breaks in with strong Zeal; The Place. Sin quitts, now garison'd by Grace; Illustrious Triumphs do the Steps of Victors trace. XCV When the loud Volleyes of her Pray'rs begin To make a Breach, they soon take in The Parapets, Redouts, and Counterscarps of Sin. XCVI At once she works and fights: With Lamp she waits, Midst Virgins, at the Bridegrooms Gates, With Him to feast; Her with his Bridal Delicates. XCVII To Heav'n now goes she on her Knees; which cry Loud, as her Tongue; much speaks her Eye: Heav'n, storm'd by Violence, yields. Eyes, Tongue, and Knees scale high. XCVIII My Last crave Pardon for my First Extreams; Be prais'd, who crown'st my Morn with Beams; Converted Age sees Visions, erring Youth dreamt Dreams. XCIX Religion's its own Lustre; Who This shun, Night-founder'd grope at midday Sun. Rebellion is its own self-tort'ring Dungeon. C Mans restlesse Minde, GODS Image, can't be blest Till of this One, This All, possest. Thou our Souls Center art, our everlasting REST! Pars superata Freti, Lucem præbentibus Astris; Longior at nostræ Pars superanda Viæ. Da, DEUS, ut Cursus suscepti nostra propinquet Meta, laboranti grata futura Rati. Magnificat Anima mea Dominum. CANTO III. The Restauration. ARGUMENT. Lætior una Dies, JESU, tua Sacra Canenti; Quàm sine Te, melicis Secula mille Lyris. Ut paveam Scelus omne, petam super Omnia Coelum; Da mihi Fræna Timor, Da mihi Calcar Amor! The Authors Rapture; Grace is prais'd; a Flood Of Tears is pour'd for Albions Blood, Shed in a Mist; for smot Micaiahs Peace is woo'd. I Muse, twang the pow'rful Harp, &amp; brush each String O'th' warbling Lute, and Canzons sing May ravish Earth, and thence to Heav'n in Triumph spring. II Noble Du-bartas, in a high-flown Trance, Observ'd to start from's Bed, and dance; Said: Thus by me shall caper all the Realm of France. III As viscous Meteors, fram'd of earthy Slime, By Motion fir'd, like Stars, do clime The woolly-curdled Clouds, &amp; there blaze out their Time. IV Streaming with burnisht Flames; yet Those but ray To spend Themselves, and light our Way; And panting Windes, to cool ours, not their own Lungs, play. V So, my enliv'ned Spirits ascend the Skies, Wasting to make the Simple wise. Who bears the Torch, himself shades, lightens others Eyes. VI As Lust for Hell, Zeal sweats to build for Heav'n, When fervent Aspirations, driv'n By all the Souls quick Pow'rs, to that high Search are giv'n. VII High is the Sphear on which Faiths Poles are hing'd: Pure Knowledge, Thou art not restring'd, Thy Flames enfire the bushie Heart, yet leave't unsing'd. VIII Suburbs of Paradise! Thou, Saintly Land Of Visions, Woo'd by Wisdoms Band; By dull Mules in gold-trappings how do'st sleighted stand! IX Whose World's a frantick Sea; more crosse Windes fly Than Sailers Compasse knows; Saints ply Their Sails through airy Waves, &amp; anchor still on High. X 'Tis Holines lands there; where None (distasted) Rave with Guilts Dread, nor with Rage wasted; Nor Beauty-dazled Eyes with Femal Wantons blasted. XI No childish Toyes; no boyling Youths wilde Thirst; No ripe Ambition; no accurst Old griping Avarice; no doting Sloth there's nurst: XII No Glutt'nies Maw-worm; nor the Itch of Lust; No Tympanie of Pride; nor Rust Of Envie; no Wraths Spleen; nor Obdurations Crust: XIII No Canker of Self-Love; nor Cramp of Cares; No Schism-Vertigo; nor night-Mares Of inward Stings affright; here lurk no penal Snares. XIV Hence Earth a dim Spot showes; where Mortals toil For shot-bruis'd Mud-walls (childish broil;) For pot-gun-cracks 'gainst Ant-hill-works; ô, what a Coil! XV Where Glutt'ny is full gorg'd; where Lust still spawns; Where Wrath takes Blood, and Avarice pawns; Where Envy frets, Pride struts, and dull Remisness yawns. XVI Where Mars th' Ascendant's: How Realms shatter'd lie, With scatter'd Courts, beneath mine Eye; Which shew like atoms chac'd by Windes Inconstancie. XVII Here, th' Universe in Natures Frame doth stand, Upheld by Truth, and Wisdoms Hand: Zanzumims shew from hence as Dwarfs on Pigmy land. XVIII How vile's the World! Fancie, keep up thy Wings, (Ruffled in Bussle of low Things, Toss'd in the common Throng) then acquiesce 'bove Kings. XIX Thus, Thou being rapt, and struck with Enthean Fire, In Skies Star-chamber strike thy Lyre: Proud Rome, not all thy Cæsars could thus high aspire. XX Mans spirit'ual State, enlarg'd, still widening flowes, As th' Helix doth: A Circle showes Mans nat'ral Life, which Death soon from its Zenith throwes. XXI Heav'ns Perspective is over-reas'ning Faith, Which Soul-entrancing Visions hath; Truths Beacon, fir'd by Love, Joyes Empire open lay'th. XXII This All-enforming Light i'th pregnant Minde, The Babe Theophila enshrin'd: Grace dawns when Nature sets: Dawn for fair Day design'd. XXIII Breathe in thy dainty Bud, sweet Rose; 'Tis Time Makes Thee to ripened Virtues clime, When as the Sun of Grace shall spread Thee to thy Prime. XXIV When her Lifes-Clock struck twelve (Hopes Noon) so bright. She beam'd, that Queens admir'd her Sight, Viewing, through Beauties Lantern, her intrinsick Light. XXV As, when fair Tapers burn in Crystal Frame, The Case seems fairer by the Flame: So, do's Heav'ns brighter Love brighten this lovely Dame, XXVI Her Soul the Pearl, her Shell out-whites the Snow, Or Streams that from stretcht Udders flow; Her Lips Rock-rubies, and her Veins wrought Saphyrs show. XXVII Attractive Graces dance about her Lips; Spice from those scarlet Portals skips; Thence Gileads mystick Balm (Griefs sov'ragin Balsam) slips. XXVIII Such precious Fume the incens'd Altar vents: So, Gums in Air breath Compliments: So, Roses damaskt Robe, prankt with green Ribbons, sents. XXIX Her Eyes amaze the Viewers, and inspire To Hearts a warm, yet chast Desire, (As Sol heats all) yet feel they in Themselves no Fire. XXX Those Lights, the radiant Windows of her Minde, Who would pourtray, as soon may finde A way to paint the viewless, poise the weightless Winde. XXXI But, might we her sweet Breast, Loves Eden, see; On those Snow-mountlets Apples be, May cure those Mischiefs wrought by the forbidden Tree. XXXII Her Hands are soft, as swannie Down, and much More white; whose temperate Warmth is such, As when ripe Gold and quickning Sun-beams inly touch. XXXIII Ye Syrens of the Groves, who, pearcht on high, Tune gutt'ral Sweets, Air-Minstrels, why From your Bough-Cradles, rockt with Windes, to Her d'ye flie? XXXIV See, Lilies, gown'd in Tissue, simper by Her; With Marigolds in flaming Tire; Green sattin'd Bayes, with Primrose fring'd, seem all on Fire. XXXV Th' art silver-voic'd, Teeth-pearl'd, thy Head's gold-thatcht, Natures Reviver, Flora's patcht, Though trickt in Mayes new Raiment, when with Thee She's matcht. XXXVI Thou, chast as fair, Eve ere she blusht: From Thee The Libe'ral Arts in Capite, The Virtues by Knight-service, Graces hold in Fee. XXXVII A gratious Soul, figur'd in Beauty, is Best Pourtrayture of Heavenly Bliss, Drawn to the Life: Wit-feign'd Pandora vails to This. XXXVIII So, Cynthia seems Star-chambers President, With crescent Splendor from Sol lent, Rallying her starrie Troop to guard her glittering Tent. XXXIX (Pearl'd Dews add Stars) yet Earths Shade shuts up soon. Her Shop of Beams; Whose Cone doth run 'Bove th' horned Moon, beneath the golden-tressed Sun. XL Wh' on Skie, Clouds, Seas, Earth, Rocks doth Raies disperse, Stars, Rainbows, Pearls, Fruits, Diamonds pierce; The Worlds Eye, Sourse of Light, Soul of the Universe. XLI Who glowes like Carbuncles, when winged Hours Dandle the Infant-Morn, which scours Dame Luna, with her twinkling Spies, from azure Tow'rs. XLII Thee, Theophil, Dayes sparkling Eye we call; Thy Faith's the Lid, thy Love the Ball, Beautying thy graceful Mein with Form Angelical. XLIII That Lady-Prioress of the cloyster'd Skie, Coacht with her spangled Vestalls nigh, Vails to this Constellation from Divinitie. XLIV Vertue's her Spring of Honour, her Allies Are Saints, Guard Angels, Heav'n her Prize; Whose Modestie looks down, while thus her Graces rise. XLV Eugenia Wit, Paidia Art affords, Eusebia Truth for Her uphords. (Poets have Legislative Pow'r of making Words.) XLVI Her Heart's a Court, her richly-temper'd Breast A Chappel for Loves regent Guest: Here feasts She sacred Poets, She Herself a Feast. XLVII Ye Bay-crown'd Lords, Who dig from Wisdoms Pits The Oar of Arts, and with your Wits Refine't, who prop the doating World in stagg'ring Fits; XLVIII And in Fames Court raise Obelisks divine; Such Symphonies do ye combine, As may inspirit Flesh with your Soul-ravishing Wine. XLIX While Winter Autumn, Summer clasps the Spring; While tenter'd Time shall Pæans sing, Your Eagle-plumes (that others waste) shall ymp Fames Wing. L The rampant Juice of Teneriffe recruits Wildely the routed Spirits: So, Lutes, Harps, Viols, Organs; ah! and Trumpets, Drums &amp; Flutes! LI Though Art should humour grumbling Bases still, Tort'ring the deep-mouth'd Catlins, till Hoarse-thundring Diapasons should the whole Room fill; LII Yet those—But string this Ladies Harp; She'l trie Each Chords tun'd Pulse, till She descry Where mosts harmonious Musicks mystick Soul do's lie. LIII Now Grace with Language chimes; Thrice blest, who tast. Their Heav'n on Earth, in Lifes Book grac't; Who leaving Sense with Sense, their Spirit with Spirits have plac't. LIV With those divine Patritians, who being not Eclips't with Sense, or Bodies Spot, Are in the Spring of living Flame Seraphick hot. LV One Taste gives Joyes! Joyes, at which, Words but rove; Schools, purblinde, grope at Things Above, Cymmerian-like, on whose Suns brow Clouds darkly move. LVI Heav'ns Paths are traceless; by Excess of Light; O're-fulgent Beams daz'd Eyes benight. Say Ephata, and Clay's Collyrium for my Sight! LVII Transported in this Extasie, befriend Me, like the Stagirite, to end My Thoughts in That Euripus, None can comprehend! LVIII This mystick Chain, ô, lengthen't still! imparts Links, fett'ring 'bove all Time-born Arts; Such sweet Divisions from tun'd Strings may ravish Hearts. LIX Best Tenure holds by th' Ear: In Saul, disguis'd, When Satan oft Tarantuliz'd, The Psalming Harp was 'bove they swaying Scepter priz'd. LX This Hymn, Zeals burning Feaver, do's refine My gross hydropick Soul; Divine Anthems unbowel Blisse, and Angels down encline. LXI Angels shot forth the happiest Christmas Newes; Ev'n CHRIST to warble Hymns did use; When Heav'ns high'st DOVE do's soar, He Wings of Verse doth chuse. LXII No Verse, no Text. Since Verse charms All, Sing on; Let Sermons wait till Psalms be done; Soul-raisers, ye prevent the Resurrection. LXIII But, ah! in War (Wraths Midwife) which do's tire, Yet never fills the Jaws of Ire, (Keen as the Evening Wolf) can She yet use her Lyre? LXIV Yes. She's unmov'd in Earth-quakes, tun'd in Jars; (Fear argues Guilt) She stands in Wars, And Storms of thund'ring Brass, bright as coruscant Stars. LXV Vertue's a Balsam to It self. Invoke She Mercie did to oyl steels Yoke: Thus, in an iron Age, This golden Virgin spoke. LXVI Dread GOD! Black Clouds surcharg'd with Storms, When Purple Robes hide Scarlet Sin, Ingrain'd from that Life-blood, which moated their Souls in begin, LXVII Our Sea-girt World (once Fort'nate Isle, O, Change Deplorable!) t' It self seems strange; Unthrifty Death has spread where thriving Peace did range. LXVIII War hath our luke-warm Claret broacht with Spears: LORD, save thy Ark from Floods of Fears, Or thy sad Spouse may sink as deep in Bloud, as Tears! LXIX She chaws Bread steept in Woes, gulpt down with Cries; She drinks the Rivers of her Eyes; Plung'd in Distress for Sin, to Thee She fainting flies. LXX Tune th' Irish Harp from Sharps to Flats! Compose Whatever vitious Harshnesse grows Upon the Scottish Thistle, or the English Rose! LXXI No ramping Lion its own Kind do's fear, No tusked Bore, no rav'ning Bear: Man, Mans Apollyon, doth CHRISTS mystick Body tear. LXXII Ye Sons of Thunder, if You'l needs fight on, Lead your fierce Troops 'gainst Turkish Moon, Out of the Line of Faiths Communication. LXXIII The large-commanding Thracian Force defie: Like Gun-stocks, though your Corps may flie To Earth, Your Souls, like Bullets, will ascend on High. LXXIV If GOD be then i'th' Camp, much more will He In's Militant Church (His Temple) be, To chasten Schism, and pervicacious Heresie. LXXV LORD! rent's thy Coat, Loves Type! This, sads the Good! Though Presters, rudely fierce, fain wou'd Be heard; Thou hat'st uncivil Pray'r, and civil Blood. LXXVI Ah, could dissembling Pulpeteers cry't Good To wade through Seas of native Blood, Break greatest Ties, play fast and loose, beneath Smects Hood! LXXVII By Such were Catechisms, Communions, Creeds Disus'd! As March spawns Frogs; so, Weeds Sprung hence. Worst Atheist from corrupted Churchman breeds. LXXVIII Use the LORDS Pray'r, be th' Publican; recant The Pharisee; Or else, avant With your six-hundred-sixtie-six-word-Covenant. LXXIX LORD, they, through faithlesse Dreams, the Feast disown Of thy SONS Incarnation! (Then whether will such Proteus-tants at last be blown?) LXXX That Feast of Feasts, Archangels Joy, Heav'n here Espous'd to Earth, Saints Blisse, most dear Prerogative o'th' Church, The Grand Day of the Year. LXXXI Man, first made Good, Himself unmade, and then; The Word, made Flesh, must dwell with Men, That, Man, thus worse then nought, may better'd be agen. LXXXII Dare to own Truth. Drones seiz'd the Bees full Bow'r; All's paint that Butterflies deflowr; As Ants improve; so, Grashoppers impair their Hour. LXXXIII When Pirat-wasps sail to the hony'd Grot, They'l finde a Trap-glasse, Death i'th' Pot: Levites, sleight not your Breast-work for vain Out-works got. LXXXIV We ken Kirk-Interest; Draco's Laws recall; Repair the old Church; Saints the Wall, True Pastors Conduits, Grace the Font, Love cements All. LXXXV Passe freely would we of Oblivion An Act, and pardon all by-gone, Would you smite Hand on Thigh, and say, What have we done! LXXXVI Truths Pensioners! your Flocks bleat; Food they need; Christs Flesh, their Meat; Blood, Drink indeed: View Glories Crown; In Season, out of Season, feed. LXXXVII Ye Friends to th' Bridegroom, Stewards to the Bride, With Oracles of Truth us guide; Truth blesseth Church and State; Faithful, till crown'd, abide. LXXXVIII So, when the Judge with his Reward appears, You'l reap in Joy what's sown in Tears: Moyst Seed-times crown the Fields with golden-bearded Ears. LXXXIX Judge-Advocate to th' wrong'd; sure, Thou to Guilt, Which would unmake thy Creatures, wilt Be just, when Inquisition's made for Blood that's spilt. XC At our Ears Port land Peace and Truth! O, then, Welcome, as Sol to th' Russ in's Den! As Shoar to shipwrackt, as to Towns dismantled, Men! XCI O, might a second Angel-Quire nere cease To Worms, worn out with Wars Distress, To sing, in all Mens hearing, their blest Song of Peace! XCII Peace! Home of Pilgrims, first Song at Christs Birth; Peace, His last Legacie on Earth; Peace, gen'ral Preface to all Good; Peace, Saints true Mirth. XCIII Love, Thou, Support to Martyrs! as Jet Straw, So Us to our Belov'd dost draw; Thou art Golds true Elixir, Thou summ'st up the Law. XCIV Who can Divine Love speak in words of Sense? Since, Man, as ransom'd, Angels thence Transcends! Such is Christs Passions high Preheminence! XCV Here did She seal her Lips, unsluce her Eyes To flowing Rhet'rick, and descries The World's a Cask, its Wine false Mirth, its Lees Fools Prize. XCVI And now, by lympid Spring of Life-joy, where Crystal is lymbect all the Year To GOD She would her Heav'n-ascending Raptures rear. XCVII Taught hence, misguided Zeal, whom Heats dispose To Animosities, may close; And bloody Furies Converts be, by pond'ring Those. XCVIII Harmonious Beauty, feast our Ear! They're Kings At least, who hear, when Love thus sings: Love, to high Graces Key skrues up low Natures Strings. XCIX Love, Thou canst Ocean-flowing Storms appease; And such oregrown Behemoths please, As tax the scaly Nation, and excise the Seas. C If, Theophil, thy Love-Song can't asswage The Fate incumbent on this Age, No Time to write, but weep; For we are ripe for Rage! Ite sacrosanctæ Tabulata per Alta Carinæ; Non opus est Fluviis, Lintea pando Mari. Ite Rates Ventis, quo vos rapit Aura, secundis: Brittica Cymba pias findat Amoris Aquas. —Animarum Sponsus IESUS. This verse appears under the frontispiece to Canto IV The Soule against Temptations fights, Whom Death and Hell present with frights: The World with Wealth and Honour courts; The Fleshes Glasse invites to Sports: But THEOPHIL by Faith her Shield, And Hopes firm Anchor stands the Field; Accompany'd with GRACE and LOVE, By ANGELS SHE does upward move. CANTO IV. The Inammoration. ARGUMENT. O, DEUS, aut nullo caleat mihi Pectus ab Igne! Aut solo caleat Pectus ab Igne Tui! Languet ut Illa Deo, mihi Mens simul æmula languet! Cœlitùs ut rapitur, me Violenta rapit! She Onset makes, first with Love-darts aloof; Then, with Zeals Fire-works, storms Heav'ns Roof; Whose Faiths Shield, &amp; Salvations Helmet are Hell-proof. THEOPHILA'S Soliloquie. 1 When Heav'ns Love! Paramount, Himself reveals, And to the suppliant Soul, her Pardon seals, At feard-Hopes doubtful Gate, w?? trembling fell, 2 (Who Heav'n-ward sails, coasts by the Cape of Hell) That Her He deigns to take, She joyes in Woes, To have in Labour pass'd the Parturition Throes. 3 All Travell-pangs, all New-birth Heart-deep Groans, All After-births of Penitential Mones, Are swallow'd up in living Streams of Bliss; 4 When as the Heav'n-born Heir, the New-man is, By th' quickning Spirit of the High'st reborn: Time past hath pas'd her Night, present presents her Morn. 5 See Joy in Light, See Light in Joy; O, see, Poor worthless Maid, Fruit brought thee from Lifes-Tree, By th' Spouse &amp; Spirit, Saints sole Supporters! Rise 6 Then, Hells Apostate, and be Heav'nly wise: Thou art (Lets interpledge our Souls) my One, My All, though not by Unitie, by Union! 7 Ineffably mysterious Knot begun; Saints mount, as Dew allur'd by beckning Sun: Loves faithful Friends, what parallels your Guard, 8 Where Truth is Sentinel, and Grace the Ward? The Way is Flow'r-strown, where the Guide is Love: His Spirit with you below, your Spirit with Him Above. 9 Reciprocal Excesse of Joy! Then, soar My Soul to Him, Who Man became; Nay more, Took Sin it self, to cleanse thy fully'd Clay, 10 But took it, only to take it away. O, Self Donation! peerlesse Guift, unknown! Now since that He is Thine, be never Thou thine own! 11 O, Prodigie of Great and Good! Faith, sound This Loves Abysse, that do's so strangly bound Almightines It Self! From Whose Veins, see, 12 Unsluc't, Loves purple Ocean, when His Free Red-streaming Life did vanquish Death &amp; Hell! That thou might'st live, He dy'd! That thou might rise, He fell! 13 God so lov'd Man, that Naturalists may deem God to set Man before Himself did seem! When Man, with seeing blinde, 'gainst God arose, 14 And slew his only Friend, God sav'd his Foes! Sol mour'nd in blacks! Heav'ns Vice-roy, Nature, swounded! Excess Loves Reason was, Immensitie Love bounded! 15 Ye Twins of Light, as Sun-flow'rs be enclin'd To th' Sun of Righteousnes; Let Taste, refin'd, Like nothing as Loves Heav'nly Manna; and 16 Let all but Christ feel rough, as Esaus Hand; Let nought like's Garment smell; Let Ears rejoyce, But in expresles Dictates of Loves whisp'ring Voice! 17 He's thy bright Sun; 'twixt Whom, and thy Souls Bliss, Thy earthie Body interposed is; Whereby such dread Eclipses caused are, 18 As fam'd Astronomers can ne're declare: Yet oft He shines; Then, vanish servile Fears; Then, Heav'n-ward filial Hopes dry up thy trickling Tears. 19 Spiritual Light Spirituals clears: In Heav'n Thou'lt view that full, what now by Glimps, like Steph'n Thou canst but spy; There, shalt thou Face to Face, 20 His Light, His Joy, His Love, His Pow'r, His Grace, And His All-Filling Glory clearly see In optick Emanations from Eternitie! 21 I'th' Ring of boundless Luster, from whose Ray This petty World gleaneth its peep of Day: Thou shalt be Crown'd with Wreaths of endless Light: 22 Here, oft's an Enterview in Heat, and Might, By Inter-lucidations from Above, Twining Embraces with's ensphearing Arm of Love! 23 Most blessed Souls, to whom He do's appear, Folded within your Arms chast Hemisphear! O,Condescent! How's Lips shed Love! Life, Merit! 24 He makes his Angels Court of Guard! By's Spirit He crowns you with his Grace! So, with his Blood, When He Redeem'd you, and consign'd His Flesh for Food! 25 Meat came from th' Eater, from the Strong did Dew Sweetnesse; when as, incomparably true, Omnipotencies Self did largely shed 26 His mystick Oil of Joy upon thy Head: Then, trample Sin in Babylons golden Cup; Treasures away She trifles, Trifles treasures up. 27 Oyl of this Lamp, obsequious Soul, lights Thee To thine approaching Heav'n in Sanctitie Be actuated then; Being up assum'd 28 By this bright Sun, with this rich Oyl perfum'd, Th' art prepossest with Heav'nly Comforts, which, With their Soul-chearing Sweets, both ravish and enrich. 29 Poor, panting Heart, Loves Seat, yearn for Joys Pith! To have (thy highest Bliss!) Communion with The Father &amp; the Son, one Spirit with Christ! 30 And One in Them, as They are One! Thou fly'st Through Grace to Glory! Vision shall sublime Thy Faith, Fruition Hope, Eternity thy Time! THEOPHILA'S LOVE-SONG. 31 Self! ô, how mean an Harmonie it breeds! JESUS! All Names this Name of Names exceeds! This Name's Gods Mercie at full Sea, 'tis Loves 32 High Tow'r, Joyes Loadstone; This, my Spirit moves. Hark: Rise my Love, my Fair One, Come away; Lingring breeds Losse; I am thy Leader, Light, and Way. 33 What Speed Speeds self can make, Soul, flie withall; Greatnes and Goodnes most Magnetical! Shoot, like a Flash of Fire, to th' ruby Wine, 34 His precious Blood, transcendently Divine! (How poor those costly pearls were, drunk by Some) My Lord, drink Blood to me! Let It to th' Worlds Health come! 35 All Hope's unanchor'd but in That. Thou art, 'Bove Indies Womb, rich to my Love-sick Heart! Flesh-fair Endowments are but Skin-deep Brags, 36 Varnisht Corruption; Wealth is but Cares Bags; The Bag impostom'd choaks. Gold, Beauty, Fame Are sublunary Mysts to Saints Seraphick Flame. 37 JESUS! This fans my Fire, which has at best But Grains of Incense, Pounds of Interest. Go, Int'rest; Take the Principal, Thine own: 38 Divine Love loves thy Lovelines alone! What Flames to Thine proportionable be! LORD, had'st not first lov'd Man, Man could not have lov'd Thee! 39 Why lov'st us, but because Thou would'st? O, why For Lepers would the Undefiled die? That Pen was dipt i'th' Standish of thy Blood, 40 Which wrot th' Indenture of our termless Good! O, Love, 'bove Wish! Never such Love enroll'd! Who think their utmost Flames enough for Thee, are cold. 41 Whose Highnes did not to be low disdain, Yet, when at Lowest, Highest did remain! Who bow'dst Heav'ns Altitude, refresh with Flowrs, 42 With JESSES Sov'raign Flow'r, my fainting Pow'rs, Which sink (as shaft-struck Hart embost) twixt Grief, And Joy: Grief for my Sin, Joy for thy free Relief. 43 Wrackt is with bitter-sweet Extreams my Minde, Shell'd, sheath'd, cag'd, coffin'd in her treacherous friend; Her always tempting mass of Flesh She bears, 44 Her Hopes, did they not sprout from Thee, were fears: Hope, Thou Perfume of Lovers, for thy Sake Love's generous, throws at All: Life's but a petty Stake; 45 Scarce worth the Prize. Love makes two Spirits but one; Me, Counterpart to thy Indenture, own; I, active then as Light, tread Air and Flame, 46 Without or Wing, or Chariot; and disclaim All the faint Sweets of Earth. Thy Spirit views How in Loves torrid Zone thy sweltring Martyr stews. 47 Row me, ye Dove-wingd Oars, whom Hope do's buoy, To wisht-for Hav'n, flowing with Tides of Joy! Yet wish I not, my Joy, thy Joyes Above, 48 Meerly for Joy; nor Pleasures of thy Love, Only for Love of Pleasure; No, let free Spiritual Languors teem! Fruitful, yet Virgins be! 49 Give, give me Children, or I die! Love, rest Thy Head upon the Pillows of my Breast! When me Thou shalt impregn'd with Vertues make 50 A fruitful Eden, All the Frutage take! Thy Passion, Jonathan, below did move; Rapt Spirits, in high Excess flame with intensest Love! 51 My Life is hid with Thee in GOD! Descry Thy Self, ô, Thou, my plighted Spouse, that I May ever glorious be! That my joy'd Soul 52 With Thee may make up Marriage! and my whole Self Thee for Bridegroom have! My Hope still sends Up Come, that I may enter with thy feasted Friends! 53 O, That long-long'd for Come! ô, Come! mine Eyes, Loves Sentinels, watch, like officious Spies! Strike Sparks of Joy t' enflame Loves Tinder! make 54 The Exile view her Home, the Dreamer wake! Tears raise the Fire of Love! Ease Sighs of Air, Fires Passion, watry Tears, and earthy self Despair! 55 My Sighs, condens'd to Drops, compute Hours spent! Cancell the Lease of my Clay-Tenement, Which payes deer Rent of Groans! ô, grant a Writ 56 Of Ease! I languish out, not live! Permit A Passe to Sions Mount! But, I resigne My green-sick Will, though sick of Love, to that of Thine! 57 Waitings, which ripen Hopes, are not Delayes; Presence how great, how true's Love, Absence saies: While Lungs my Breath shall organ, I'l press still 58 Th' Exinanition of my o'regrown Will. Behold, I quickly come. O're-joy'd I'm here! O Come! Till then, each Day's an Age, each Hour a Year. 59 JESU! (That Name's Joyes Essence!) hasten on! Throng amorous Sighs for Dissolution! Fastidious Earth, avant; With Love-plumes soar, 60 My Soul, to meet thy Spouse. Can'st wish for more? Only Come! give a RING! Re-eccho then, O, Come. Even so, LORD JESU, Come! Amen. Amen. LXI Who's this Inamor'd Vot'resse? Like the Morn From Mountain unto Mountain born? Who first, with Night-drops dew'd, seem'd Turtle Dove forlorn? LXII But now, e're warped Body, neer Decay, Stands, Bow-like, bent, to shoot away Her Soul, Ere prone Looks kiss her Grave, e're her last Day, LXIII She (Love-fill'd) wants no Mate, has rather one Body too much. I'th' Spirits Throne CHRISTS Peace is fullest Quire! Such Loneness, least alone! LXIV When soft-flying Sleep, Deaths Sister, Wings do's spread Over that curtain'd Grave, her Bed, Then, with prophetick Dreams the Highest crowns her Head. LXV Behold, a comely Person, clad in white, The all-inlightning Sun, lesse bright Than that illustrious Face of His, which blest her Sight. LXVI To Her, in Majestie, His Way HE broke, And, softly thus to Her HE spoke. Come, Come away. My JESUS? saies She. So, She woke. LXVII Her Pray'rs, more passionate, than witty, rise, As Sols Postilion, bright; her Eyes, Wrastling with GOD for Grace, bedew Loves Paradise. LXVIII Betimes, when keen breath'd Winds, with frosty Cream, Peri'wig bald Trees, glaze tatling Stream: (For May-games past, white-sheet-peccavi is Winters Theme. LXIX Those Day-breaks give good Morrows, w?? she takes With Thanks, so, doubly Good them makes. Who in GODS Promise rests, in GODS Remembrance wakes. LXX Saints nothing more, Saints nothing lesse regard, Than LOVES SELF, than self-Love; unscar'd, Though rackt into an Anagram, their Souls being spar'd. LXXI Through Vertuous Self-mistrust They acted move Like Needle, toucht by th' Stone of Love. Blest Magnet, which attracts, and Souls directs Above! LXXII Were She but mortal, She were satisfy'd, So GOD liv'd in Her, till She dy'd; His Word, her Deed; his Will, her Warrant; Both, her Guide. LXXIII Thus, this Devota breaths out yerning Cries. Let not Dust blinde my sensual Eyes, When as my Spirits Energie transcends the Skies! LXXIV Virtues raise Souls. All's Filial to Above; Low'st Step is Mercenary Love; Fraternal are the Sides that Saints Ascent improve. LXXV Manna to my enamour'd Soul, art THOU! The Spirit of Heav'n, distill'd, do's flow From thy Aspect; By That, from Brutes, we Angels LXXVI Had I, ô, had I many Lives, as Years; As many Loves, as Love hath Fears; All, All were Thine, had I as many Hearts, as Hairs! LXXVII From THEE my Joy-Extensions spreading flow; Dilating, as Leaf-gold! be n't slow, O, THOU, my All, and more! Love-lorn, THEE still I woo! LXXVIII The Widow press'd, till THEE to grant She bound; The Virgin sought Thee, till she found; The Publican did knock, till opening, knocking crown'd. LXXIX Though nought but dross I in my self can spie, Yet melted with Thy beaming Eye, My Refuse turns to Gold, by mystick Alchymie; LXXX Then, whet thy blunt Sythe, Time, and wing thy Feet: Life, not in Length, but Use, is sweet: Come, Death, (the Body brought a bed o'th' Soul) Come, fleet! LXXXI Be Pulse, my passing-Bell; be Skin, my Herse: Nights sable Curtains that disperse The Rayes of Day, be Shroud: Dews, weep my funeral Verse! LXXXII Pittie me, Love-sick Virgins! Then, She swound; O'recome with Zeal, She sunk to th' Ground: Darts of intolerable Sweets her Soul did wound. LXXXIII She lay with flaming Love empierc't to th' Heart: Wak't, As She bled, She kist the Dart; Then sigh'd. Take all I am, or have! All, All Thou art! LXXXIV Then, sunk again. Reviv'd, Loves Bow She bent, And marry'd String to Shaft, and sent Ejaculations, which the Skies, like Lightning, rent. LXXXV Piercing Them through (feather'd with Sighs) to show She little pay'd, yet much did owe: The Feathers sung, and fir'd, as they did upward go. LXXXVI No ice-fring'd Cloud may quench Loves soaring Flame: Love is more strong then Death, or Shame. Grown up all Soul, the Flesh sinks in a triple Qualm. LXXXVII I charge ye, Sion Virgins, let Her still Enjoy her disencloystred Fill In These high Extasies of Union and Will. LXXXVIII Do not with Claps of Hands, or noise of Feet, Awake Her from what is more sweet, Till the bright rising Day-star light Her to Heav'ns Street. LXXXIX Yeeld Her, what her unfetter'd Rapture gives, Since She's more where She loves, than lives: Transanimations, scaling Heav'n, break carnal Gyves. XC In Loves triumphant Chariot plac't She is; Concentrick are her Joyes with His Encharioted in Fire, her Spirit Heav'n-ripe for Blisse. XCI They're only sound, who Thus are lost in Trance; Transported to the High'st Advance, With Him, who was in Spirit rapt to' expresseless Glance. XCII Return'd; She cry'd. O, slay me thus again! Ne're lives She who thus ne're is slain! How sweet the Wounds of Love! No Pleasure to Loves pain! XCIII In furnac't Heat, Pyrausta-like, I fry! To live is Faith! 'tis Gain to die! One Life's enough for Two! Thou liv'st in me, not I! XCIV How, mid'st Regalios of Loves Banquet, I Dissolve in Sweets Extremitie! O, Languors! Thus to live is in pure Flames to die! XCV Three Kings three Gifts to th' King of Kings did bring; Myrrhe, Incense, Gold, to Man, God, King: For Myrrhe, Tears; Incense Pray'rs; Gold, take Loves Offering! XCVI O, take Loves Hecatomb! Then, through her Eyes Did Love inamoring Passions rise: High'st Glory crowns Theophila's Love-Sacrifice. XCVII Not She, Mortality alone did die; Death's but Translation to the Skie: All Virtues fir'd in her pure Breast their Spicerie. XCVIII As, when Arabias Wonder Spices brings, Which fann'd to Flames by her own Wings, She, from the glowing Holocaust in Triumph springs: XCIX So, Virtues Pattern, (Priestesse, Altar, Fire, Incense, and Victime) up did spire; Victoria, Victoria, sung All Heav'ns Quire. C She Ecchoing (Eccho, which do's all surpasse! GODS Sight is Glories Looking-glasse!) Magnificats, Hosannas, Halleluiahs! Pars Cursûs emensa mei, Pars restat aranda: Ex æquo Metam Vesper &amp; Ortus habent. Ergo per immensos properent cava Lintea Fluctus: Jactatam capiant Littora sancta Ratem! —Amans Animâ satiatur Amantis. This verse appears under the frontispiece to Canto V. View here the Authors high Designe, His Book displaid, his Tapers shine, Is Athenian Bird, the Dog, and Cat, Which watchfull Study intimate. THEOPHLA doth before Him stand Amused wits erected Hand; And, like an Eagle, upward flies, Rapt by bright ANGELS to the SKIES. CANTO V. The Representation. ARGUMENT. Mundus Opes, Animam Coelum, Terramque resumpsit Terra: DEUS, Vitam cum tulit, Ipse dedit. Solus Amor facit esse DEUM; Quem, Mente capaci, Si Quis conciperet, posset &amp; esse DEUS. The Authors Vision, Her Ascent, Heav'ns Place Descry'd, where reigns all glorious Grace, Where's all-sufficient Good, the Sum of Blisse She has. I I'm vile, a thing impure, Corruptions Son, Earth-crawling Worm, by Sin undone, Whose suppliant Dust doth own its Shame, and t' Heav'n doth run. II Grace, intervene 'twixt Sin and Shame, and tie A hopeful Blisse to Miserie! LORD, pardon dust and ashes: both, yea worse, am I! III Though dust, thy Work: though Clay, Thy Hand did turn This Vessel; and, though ashes, th' Urn Thou art, them to restore when Skie &amp; Earth shall burn. IV Whil'st that my Heav'n-allyed-Soul does stay Wholly on Thee, not Europs Sway Can elevate my Wish, like one Grace-darted Ray. V Meet, meet my prison'd Souls Address! oh, might She view, through mouldring Earth, thy Sight! Grace perfects Natures want: Say here, Let there be Light! VI Then, though in Flesh my Spirit pris'ned be, She may by Faith ascend to THEE, And up be rais'd, till she shall mount to Libertie. VII Clear-sighted Faith, point out the Way; I will Neglect curl'd Phrases frizled Skill: Humble Devotion, lift Thou up my flagging Quill; VIII Which faints at first Approach; my Faith's too light To move This Mountain, reach This Height: Can squeaking Reeds sound forth the Organs full delight? IX I'm mute, for only Light can Light declare; A Diamond must a Diamond square; Yet, where I dare not speak, there yet adore I dare. X Ear has not heard, nor Eye has seen, nor can Mans Heart conceive (vast Heart of Man) The Riches treasur'd up in Glories Ocean! XI Tomes full of mystick Characters enfense Those Seas of Blisse! To write to Sense Heav'ns Chronicle, wou'd ask a Heav'nd-Intelligence. XII How then, from Flood of Tears may' an Arkt Dove try Its ventrous Pineons, to descry That Land, unknown to Nature? Vast Eternitie! XIII Fear Gulfs unfathomable; nor desire, Ere of GODS Court thou art, t' aspire To be of's Counsell; Pry not, but with Awe admire. XIV Dwarf-words do limp, do derogate, do scan Nor Height; nor Depth. Since Time began, What constitutes a Gnat was ne're found out by Man. XV Dares mortal Slime, with ruder tongue, expresse What ev'n Celestials do confesse Is inexpressible? Thou Clod of Earth, first guesse XVI In like Degrees from Æquinoctial Track, Why Men are tawny, white, and black? Why Bactrias Camel two? Arabs, one Bunch on's Back? XVII Canst lead Leviathan with a silken String? Canst cover with a Hornets Wing Behemoth? Canst thou Seas into a Nutshell bring? XVIII Canst Motion fix? count Sands? recall past Day? Shew Height, Breadth, Length o'th' spreading Ray? Discardinate the Sphears? and rapid Whirlwindes stay? XIX Tell, tell how pond'rous Earths huge proplesse Ball Hangs poised in the fluent Hall Of fleeting Air? how Clouds sustained are from Fall? XX How burnt the Bush, when Verdure cloth'd its Fire? How from the Rock, Rod-struck in Ire, Did Cataracts gush out? How did the Sea retire? XXI Canst thou take Post-Horse with the coursing Sun, And with Him through the Zodiack run? How many Stages be there ere the Race be done? XXII Then, tell how once He shot his Beams down-right From the same Zenith, while for Night, Mortals stood gazing at a doubled Noon-dayes-Light? XXIII Tell, how that Planet did in after-dayes Turn Cancer, shooting Parthian Rayes, Ten whole Degrees reverst, which did the World amaze. XXIV Poor thingling Man! Propitious Heav'n, assign Some Angel for this high Design! Heav'ns Historie requires at least a Seraphin. XXV O, might some glorious Spirit then retire, And warble to a sacred Lyre The Song of Moses and the Lamb in Heav'ns full Quire! XXVI 'Twas at Nights Noon, when Sleep th' Opprest had drown'd; But sleepless were Oppressors found; 'Twas, when Skies spangled Head in sable Veil was bound: XXVII For, theevish Night had stole, and clos'd up quite, In her dark Lantern, starrie Light: No Planet seen to sail in that dead Ebbe of Night: XXVIII When, lo, all-spreading Rayes the Room surround! Like such Reflections, as rebound, Shooting their Beams to th' Sun, from Rocks of Diamond. XXIX This, to a Wonder, summoned my Sight, Which dazled was at so pure Light! A Form Angellick there appear'd divinely bright! XXX I wisht my Self more Eyes to view this Gleam; I was awake, I did not dream; Too exquisite Delight makes true Things feigned seem. XXXI Model of Heav'n it was; I floated long Twixt Joy and Wonder; Passion strong, Wanting due Vent, made Sight my Speech, &amp; Eyes my Tongue! XXXII Oft, my rapt Soul, ascending to the Eye, Peept through upon Angelitie, Whose Blaze did burnisht Plate of sparkling Sol outvie! XXXIII If gratious Silence shin'd forth any where With sweet Aspect, 'twas in this Sphear; The Soul of Sweetness, and the Spirit of Joyes mixt here. XXXIV From out Loves Wing He must a Pensil frame, Who, on Times cloth, would paint this Flame: None can pourtray this glorious Draft but who's the same. XXXV Vail then, Timantes-like, this guess'd at Face, (The Curtain of That inward Grace) Whose Forehead with Diaphanous Gold impaled was. XXXVI For, starrie Knobs, like Diamonds, did attire That Front with Glory, and conspire To lavish out their Beams, to radiate that Fire. XXXVII Whose Amber-curling Tresses were unbound, And, like a glittering Veil, spread round, And so about the snowy Shoulders sweetly wound. XXXVIII Whose Robe shot forth a Tissue-waving Shine, Which seem'd loose-flowing, far more fine Than any interwoven Silk with silver-Twine. XXXIX With gratious Smile, approaching neerer, sate This glorious Thing: ô, humble State! Yet, on the Vision inexpressive Rayes did wait. XL 'Twas glorify'd Theophila sat there. I, mute, as if I tongueless were, Till Her Voice-Musick drew my Soul into mine Ear: XLI 'Twas 'bove Lutes sweetest Touch, or richest Air! I bring Thee Things (saies She) are rare: All subcœlestial Streams Drops to this Ocean are. XLII Hear, first, my Progresse. Loos'd from Natures Chain, And quit from Clay, I did attain, Swift as a glancing Meteor to th' Aerial Plain: XLIII Where, passing through, I did perfume the Air With sacred Spice, and incenst Pray'r; While grateful Clouds their liquid Pearl, as Guift, prepare. XLIV I spare t'unlock those Treasuries of Snow; Or tell what paints the rainy Bowe; Or what cause Thunders, Lightnings, Rains; or whence Windes flow. XLV Those Regions pass'd, where bearded Comets light The World to fatall Woes; a bright Large Orb of harmless Fire enflam'd my Heav'n-ward Flight. XLVI To azure-arched Skie ascends my Soul, (Thence view I North and Southern Pole) Where Globes in Serpentine, yet order'd Motions rowl. XLVII Thence by the changing Moons alternate Face, Up, through unweari'd Phosphors Place, I mount to Sols Diurnal and his Annual Race: XLVIII By whose propitious Influence Things are Quickned below, this Monarch Star, Making his Progresse through the Signes, unclouds the Air; XLIX And, eight-score Times out-bulks the Earth; whose Race In four and twenty Howers space 'Bove fifty Milions of Germanick Leagues do's pace. L This Giant with as many Tongues as Rayes, Speaks out, so oft as He displayes His Beams, which gild the World; that Man his LORD should praise. LI Through Sphears I pass'd to Stars, that nail Heav'ns Court, (My Stay was with Skie-wonders short,) Which, by first Movers Force, are whirl'd about their Fort. LII Through the blew-spangled Frame, my psalming Tongue Made th' Orbs suspend their usual Song, To hear Cœlestial Hymns the glist'ring Quires did throng. LIII Chime out, ye Crystal Sphears, and tune your Poles; Skies, sound your Base, ere ye to Coals Dissolve, and tumble on the Bonfire World in Shoals. LIV The Primum Mobile do's seem immense, And doth transfused Influence Through all inferiour Orbs, as swift as Thought, dispense. LV Suppose, a Milstone should from thence be hurl'd Unto the Center of this World, 'Twould make up sixscore Years, ere it could down be whirld. LVI Now, entred I Heav'ns Suburbs, pard with Gems; No orient Jewels cast such Beams; (O, might this Verse be wreath'd but with such Diadems!) LVII Sols radiant Fulgence in meridian Skies Seem'd Shade unto those Clarities; Where Beauties Self might beautifie her fairest Eyes. LVIII 'Tis 'bove high'st Verge, where Reason dares be bold; That Heav'n of GOD is of such Mold, That Eyes, till glorify'd, cannot the same behold. LIX 'Tis purely Spirit'al, and so must be, Above compare in all Degree, With Ought that draws its Line from th' six Dayes Pedigree. LX 'Tis immaterial, 'bove the highest Sphear, Doth brighter then the rest appear; Than Orbs of Fire, Moon, Sun, or Crystaline more clear. LXI 'Tis Space immense, from whence Apostates driv'n, Their Rooms might so to Men be giv'n With Those confirmed Sons, th' Indigenæ of Heav'n. LXII Absurdly some Philosophers did dream, That Heav'n's an uncreated Beam Which forth eternally from GOD HIMSELF did stream. LXIII 'Tis but a Creature, though its Essence be To change unsubject, standing free On never shaken Pillars of Infinitie. LXIV Ocean of Joyes! Who can Thee fully state? For clearer knowledge Man must wait; First shoot Deaths Gulf, thy Soul may then arrive thereat: LXV For no One enters There, till He hath trod Deaths Path, then, from that Period Elected Souls ascend to Heav'n, to Blisse, to GOD! LXVI (Zeal through me fir's its way to speak, that I Would thither, like wing'd Lightning, flie, Were my Flesh-curtain drawn that clouds my Spirits Eye! LXVII What Heights would Souls affect, could they undress Themselves of Rags, that them depress! How beautiful's the Form of naked Holines! LXVIII New Light, Life, Love, Joy, Bliss there boundless flow! There shall my Soul thy Glory know, When She her Robe of Clay shall to Earths wardrobe throw! LXIX Fond that I am to speak. Passe on to Blisse, That with an individual Kisse Greets Thee for ever! Pardon this Parenthesis.) LXX Faith's the Souls Eye; As nothing were between, They that beleeve, see Things unseen: Close then thy carnal, thy spiritual Eyes unscreen. LXXI For, my transplanted Spirit shall emblaze Words, may make Wonder stand at Gaze: Unbounded Bliss doth ev'n the sep'rat Spirit amaze! LXXII O, Fleet of Intellectuals, Glory-fraught, (Inestimable Arras, wrought With Heart-orecoming Colours) how ye pass all Thought! LXXIII Thou All-comprizing, uncompriz'd! Who art Ever, yet never made, impart Thou (Loves Abyss, without or Ebbe, or Shoar) an Heart LXXIV Of Wisdom to attempt, proceed, and end what never Was, Is, Can be penn'd! (May Spots in Maps (dumb Teachers) Empires comprehend? LXXV The Skie-enchased Di'amonds lesser show Than Julie's hairy Worms that glow, Sampled with those Rebounds unbounded Glories throw. LXXVI That Vessel of Election, rapt to th' Soil Of highest Blisse, did here recoyl: I'th' same Attempt 'tis Honour to confess a Foyl. LXXVII Sense knowes not 'bove Court-Triumphs, Thrones, or Kings, Gems, Musick, Beauties, Banquetings, Without such Tropes it can't unfold Spiritual Things. LXXVIII O, how That most unutterable Blaze Of Heav'ns all-luminating Rayes Do's Souls (disrob'd of Flesh) both brighten, &amp; amaze! LXXIX That boundless Solstice, with transparent Beams, Through Heav'ns triumphant Arches streams, And, gliding through each Spirit with intrinsick Gleams LXXX Pierceth to th' little World, and doth dispell The gloomy Clouds of Sin, that swell The Soul, decoying it to ever-burning Hell! LXXXI By Glory, how are Spirits made divine! How super-radiantly They shine From th' ever-flowing Spring of the refulgent TRINE! LXXXII Beyond Report of high'st Discourse They dart Their Radiations, 'bove all Art! This cath'like Blisse ore-flowes the most capacious Heart! LXXXIII Conceive a Court, where all Joyes domineer, Where Seas of Sweets oreflow, and where Glories exhaustless Mines, Sports endless Springs, appear: LXXXIV Where infinite Excesse of Sweets ne're cloyes! Where, still Fruitions Feast employes Desire! where Who enjoy the least can't count their Joyes! LXXXV One may t' a Glimps, None to a Half can rise, Had He more Tongues, than Heav'n has Eyes! Such, nothing see, as would in Words this Sight comprize! LXXXVI Can Measures such Unmeasurables hold? Can Time Infinitie unfold? Superlative Delights may be admir'd, not told. LXXXVII When Glories Heav'n is all one Sunny Blaze, That flowing Radiance doth amaze, While on That inconceivable Result we gaze! LXXXVIII What King would not court Martyrdome, to hold In Capite a Citie of Gold, Where, look how many Gates, so many Pearls are told! LXXXIX The Structure's Square; A firm Foundation, Twelve-fold, for Each a precious Stone, The LAMBS Apostles Names engraven therupon. XC There sparkles forth the verdant Emerald, The blew-ey'd Saphyr therein wall'd, The Topaz too, with that Stone which from Gold is call'd: XCI There, Jasper, Chalœdon, Chrysoprase shine, There Sardonix, and Sardius joyn, There Beryl, Hyacinth, and Amethyst combine. XCII No sympathizing Turkise there, to tell By Palenesse th' Owner is not well, For, Grief's exild to Earth, and Anguish groans in Hell! XCIII The Streets with Gold perspicuous are arrai'd, With blazing Carbuncles inlaid; Yet, All seem Night, to Glories from the LAMB desplay'd: XCIV For, thousand Suns make an Eclipse to Those! The Diamond there for Pavement growes, As, on its glitt'ring Stock, and all its Sparkles throwes. XCV And there, on every Angel-trodden Way Loose Pearls, instead of Pebbles, play, Like duskie atoms in the Suns embrightning Ray. XCVI Had I a Quill sent from a Seraphs Wing, And Skill to tune't! I could not sing The Moity of that Wealth, w?? That All-glorious King XCVII Of Heav'n enstates Those in, who follow Good, And prize't above their vital Blood! Heav'n my be gain'd on Earth, but never understood! XCVIII As, when the Sun shakes off the Vail of Night, And scatters on the Dawn his Light, He soon takes Pris'ner to Himself th'engaged Sight: XCIX So, when I view those indeficient Beams, O, They in overfulgent Gleams, Like Diamonds, thaw'd to Air, embubble forth in Streams! C Ev'n Spirits, who have disrob'd their Rags of Clay, Lay'd up in Ward-robe till that Day, Orecome, They dazled are by each Imperious Ray! Sexta repercussi, Pars antepenultima, Ponti, Imparibus restat perficienda Modis; Quam (si præstiterit Mentem Deus Optimus) addam Flammiferos Phœbus cum jugat ortus Equos. Ex obscuro spectabile Coelum. CANTO VI. The Association. ARGUMENT. Panduntur Coeli, juvat hinc invisere Divûm Atria, mortali non adeunda Pede: Hîc, Animæ pennis advecta Theophila, cernit Agmina Coelicolûm ducere sancta Choros. Heav'ns Order, Beauty, Glory is descry'd; Here, read the State o'th' Glorify'd, Which Theophil i'th' Heraldry of Heav'n had ey'd. I Those happy Mansions, glorious Saint, discover, Where the bright Host of Spirits hover! Bring down all Heav'n before the Eyes o'th' Heav'nly Lover. II Frail Man, with Zeal, and Wonder here behold Clay cast into a Heav'nly Mold: Faith did, now Vision does Beatitude unfold. III The Tenants in This splendid Frame are They Whose grosser and unpolish Clay, Calcin'd in Graves, now Robes of Glory do array. IV Here Martyrs sit enthron'd, who late did bleed Sap from their fertil Wounds, to feed With Oyl the Churches Lamps, and with red Dew her Seed. V These ovant Souls, Knights of Saint Vincent are, For high Atchievements gain'd; each Scar, To make a golden Constellation, seems a Star. VI Not by inflicting, but receiving Blowes, By suff'ring, They ore came their Foes: How long, Lord, ere Thou do'st avenge their Blood on Those? VII These own their Bliss, sprung from the Word &amp; Will O'th' Lamb, by Whom They conquer'd still. Themselves, and that revolted Band that Hell do's fill. VIII Therefore, Each prostrate casts, with th' Elders, down At the LAMBS Feet their Palm and Crown, Beholding round all Eminencies, but their own. IX Th' Apostles here, with Him, in whose sweet Tongue The Lute of high-tun'd Love was strung, When through so many Regions He the Gospel sung. X The loving, lov'd Evangelist here lives On Loves pure Influence, and gives No Bounds to's flaming Love, but how to heighten't strives. XI Love was his only Theme. She, here is crown'd, Who, neer Deaths Tomb, Life risen found; Whose Eye-bowl was Tear-brimm'd, whose Towel Hair unbound. XII Parcht Africks Glory, born in's Mothers Eyes, (An happier Off-spring of her Cries, Than of her Womb) here to ecstatick Love does rise. XIII The Bounds are boundless of divine Amour; Love hopes, and yet hath all Things, for, In Heav'ns eternal Heraldry, true Love is Or. XIV Fruition Love enfires, thence Zeal's renu'd; Love hath the SPIRITS Plenitude, Burning with Flames in Splendor of Beatitude! XV Love caus'd the SON of GOD from's Throne dismount, And make Himself of no Account, Become a Man of Sorrows, Who of Joy's the Fount! XVI This Love, by Quire of Heav'n scarce understood! Could so much Ill cause so much Good, For Mans Redemption that GODS SON should shed His Blood? XVII Thou, Love, when as my guilty Soul did dwell In Nest of Ruine, did'st unshell My Spirit (fledg'd with Grace) from that disord'red Cell, XVIII And, having crusht the outward Film of Earth, Gav'st Her, new form'd with Glory, Birth That She might stye to th' Seat of Beatifick Mirth! XIX And praise Thee, with those Virgin-Souls, who in The Cloysters of their Flesh have bin Washt in their Saviours Bath of Blood from Spots of Sin. XX Flow'rs on our Heads, as on their Stems, do grow, Which into fadeless Colours flow, Nor Cold to blast, nor Heat to scorch, nor Age they know. XXI Scenting 'bove thousand precious Ointments, shed On consecrated Aarons Head; Above pearl'd Dew on Hermons ever-fragrant Bed. XXII How far, immaculate Flames, do You excell All that in Thoughts high Turret dwell! What then can Opticks see? What then can Volumes tell? XXIII If Beauties Self we could incarnate see, Teeming with Youth and Joy, yet She Would not so beauteous as the Virgin-Mother be. XXIV Who, like a full-orb'd Moon, our Stars out-shin'd In glorious Fulgurance of Minde! For whose surpassing Splendour I this Ode desig'nd. XXV Hail, blessed Virgin-Spouse, who did'st bequeath Breath unto Him, Who made Thee breathe! And gav'st a Life to Him, Who gave the Life from Death! XXVI Who bor'st Him in thy Womb, Whose Hands did stack The studded Orbs with Stars, and tack The glowing Constellations to the Zodiack! XXVII And, what improves the Mystery begun, New Mysteries from Thee were spun, He did, at once, become thy Father, Spouse, and Son! XXVIII Conceiving HIM, as by the Womb, so th' Ear! By th' Angels Tongue Heav'n cast Seed there! Thou heard'st, believ'dst, &amp; thence didst breed, &amp; thence didst bear! XXIX Thou only may'st (so it be humbly) boast To have brought forth the Eternal Host By mystick Obumbration of the HOLY GHOST! XXX By Thee did GOD and Man embrace Each other! Thus, Heav'n to Earth became a Brother! Thus, Thou, a Virgin, to thy MAKER wast a Mother! XXXI Thy Fleece was wet, when all the Ground lay drie! Drie, when all moist about did lie! As Aarons rootless Rod, so didst Thou fructifie! XXXII Thou art, from whence Faiths Burgeon sprang, the Ground! Before, in, after Birth was found Purenesse untoucht, with Virgin-Mothers Honour crown'd! XXXIII Thou, Shrine of Glory, Ark of Blisse, Thou, high Fair Temple of Divinity, In Thee, the Master-peece of Nature I descry! XXXIV My ravisht Soul (said She) extols His Name, Who rules the Heav'ns expansed Frame, Whose Mercie rais'd me up to magnifie the Same. XXXV Who can anatomize the glorious List Of Heirs to GOD, Coheirs with CHRIST, Who Royalize it There by Graces high Acquist? XXXVI Whose several Glories admirable are! And yet as Infinite, as Fair! Where Alls's enjoy'd at Full; where every Thing is rare! XXXVII The Joy of Each One is the Joy of All! Beatitude's reciprocall! They drink Christs Cup of flowing Wine, who pled'gd his Gall! XXXVIII Silence most Rhet'rick hath, and Glories best Do pourtray forth that Royal Feast, At which each blessed Saint is an Eternal Guest! XXXIX Nor can a Thought of earthly Friends Annoyes Extenuate one Grain of Joyes, While Mercy saves the Wise, while Justice Fools destroyes! XL Strangely their Intellects enlightned be! Natures Compendium did not see One half; yea, ere He tasted the forbidden Tree! XLI If, that Sea-parting Prince, from cleft Rocks Space Viewing GODS Back-parts, thought it Grace, What Honour is it then to see HIM Face to Face! XLII Who doth inspirit the indeficient Ray, Not dimm'd with a minute Allay; Where, though no Sun ere rose, yet 'tis Eternal Day! XLIII Where, All are fill'd, yet All from Food abstain! Where All are Subjects, yet All reign! All rich, yet have no Bags that stifled Wealth contain! XLIV Where each Saint do's a glorious Kingdom own; Where each King hath a starry Crown; Each Crown a Kingdom, free from the rude Peoples Frown. XLV Where Each hath All, yet, more than All, They owe; All Subjects, yet no Kings They know, Save King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, who quel'd their Foe. XLVI Where highest Joy is their perpetual Fare; Their Exercise Hosannas are; Spirits the Choristers, the Subject Praise and Prayer. XLVII The Laureate King his Psalming Voice doth raise, And sings to's solemn Harp high Layes, Being Himself the Organ to His MAKERS Praise. XLVIII Enflam'd with holy Zeal, and high Desire, Encircled with the Enthean Quire, Warbles This Epinician Canzon to his Lyre. XLIX Thou, Crown of Blisse, whose Footstool's Earth, whose Throne Outshines ten thousand Suns in One, Who art the Radical Life of all true Joy alone! L Royal PROTECTOR! when in THEE, Light's Sun, Mortals wou'd deem the last Hour run, We finde no Wane of Day, but a Solstitial Noon! LI When, We Times Volumes of past Thousands scan, Thy Origen with Time to span, We finde no Track in Infant Age when It began! LII Ancient of Dayes! to Whom all Times are Now; Before Whom, Seraphims do bow, Though highest Creatures, yet to their CREATOR, low! LIII Who art by Light-surrounded Powers obey'd, (Heav'ns Host Thy ministring Spirits made) Cloath'd with UBIQUITY, to Whom all Light is Shade! LIV Whose Thunder-clasping Hand do's grasp the Shole Of total Nature, and unroul The spangled Canopy of Heav'n from Pole to Pole! LV Who, on the Clouds and Windes, thy Chariot, rid'st; And, brideling wildest Storms, them guid'st; Who, moveless, All dost move; Who, changing All, abid'st! LVI The Ocean Thou begirt'st with misty Shrouds; That Monster wrapt'st in swathing Clouds, And, with thy mighty Word controul'st tempestuous Flouds! LVII Earth-circling Oceans Thy Displeasure flee; Mountains dismounted are by Thee; Those airy Giants smoak if Thou incensed be! LVIII Innumerable Troops of Joyes do stand Before thy boundless Presence, and Uncessantly attend Thy ever-blissefull Hand! LIX Thou, LORD; Good, without Quality, dost send Blisse to All Thine; Great, without End; Whose Magnitude no Quantity can comprehend! LX What's worthlesse Man? what his earth-crawling Race? That Thou shouldst such a shadow grace, And in unspeakable triumphant Glory place! LXI Who may thy Mercies Height, Depth, Breadth extend? In Height It do's to Heav'n ascend, Confirms the Angels, and in Depth doth low descend, LXII Lessening the Pains o'th' damned ev'n in Hell; In Breadth, from East to West do's swell, And over all the World, and all thy Works excell! LXIII Immense EXISTENCE! Heav'n's amaz'd at thy INCOMPREHENSIBILITIE! Intelligencies dread Thine All commanding-Eye! LXIV Ye winged Hero's, whom all Blisse embow'rs, To HIM in Anthems strain your pow'rs, Whose Sea of Goodness has no Shoar, whose Age, no How'rs! LXV Then, ore the trembling Cords his swift Hand strayes, And clos'd All with full Diapaze; As, in a sounding Quire the well-strook Consort playes. LXVI Victorious Jubilies, when Eccho'd clear From the Church-Militant, are dear To Heav'ns triumphing Quire; Such no gross Ear can hear. LXVII Musicks first Martyr, Stradas Nightingale, Might ever wish (poor Bird) to fall On that excelling Harp, and joy i'th Funeral! LXVIII Had it but heard Those Ayrs, where Musick meets With Raptures of Voice-warbled Sweets, Flowing with ravishing Exces in Sions Streets. LXIX All, what Symphonious Breaths inspire, All, what Quick Fingers touch, compar'd, sound flat: Could I but coyn a Word beyond all Sweets! 'Twere That LXX What Orders in New-Salems Hierarchie, In what Degrees They enstated be, Are Wings that mount my Thoughts to high Discovery. LXXI Blest Sight, to see Heav'ns order'd Host to move In Legions glist'ring All Above, Whose Armour is true Zeal, whose Banner is pure Love! LXXII Bright-harnessed Intelligencies! Who Enucleate can your Essence so, As Men may both your mighty Pow'r, &amp; Nature know! LXXIII Invisible, impassive, happy, fair, High, incorporeal, active, rare, Pure, scientifick and illustrious Spirits You are. LXXIV Guesse at their Strength, by One; Was not almost Two hundred thousand of an Host By an Angel slain, when Assurs Chief 'gainst Heav'n did boast? LXXV In Brightness They the Morning Star out-vie; In Nimbleness the Windes out-flie; And far surpasse the Sun-beams in Subtilitie. LXXVI Archangels, Those superiour Spirits, are GODS Legats, when he will declare His Minde to's Chosen; Gabriel did thus prepare LXXVII GODS Embassie, when his Belov'd did tie Our Flesh to his DIVINITIE; Grace was the Kisse, the Union was the Ring from High; LXXVIII Angels the Posie sung: This, made our Clay O're Empyræan Courtiers sway, When as the SPOUSE his mystick Nuptials did display. LXXIX No sooner shall That great Archangel sound His wakefull Trump of Doom to th' Ground, And Eccho shall, as banded Ball, make quick Rebound; LXXX But, pamper'd Graves, with all their Jawes, shall yawn; And Seas, Flouds Nurse, strange Shoals shall spawn Of Men, to wait o'th' dreadfull Judge at's Judgements Dawn. LXXXI To Incorruption then Corruptions Night Shall turned be; for That strange Sight Inebriates Souls with deepest Woes, or high'st Delight! LXXXII Then shall my Ear, my Nose, my Hand, Tongue, Eye, Alwayes hear, smell, feel, taste, espye, Hosanna's, Incense, Off'rings, Feasts, Felicitie! LXXXIII To act GODS Will, ore sublunary Things, The Dominations sway, as Kings; He curbs Aerian Potentates, by th' Pow'rs He wings; LXXXIV The Principates, of Princes take the Care, T' enlarge their Realms, or to empair; Virtues in acting of his Will have their full Share; LXXXV Thrones HIM contemplate, nor from's Presence move; To Cherubs HE reveals Above Hid Things; He Seraphins enflames with ardent Love. LXXXVI Præcelling Seraphs shew GODS Ardor still; Wise Cherubs his Abysse of Skill In Governing of All; beatious Thrones instill LXXXVII To us his Steddines in's blessed Throne, Ever unalterably ONE; Powr's, Virtues, Principates to his Commands are prone; LXXXVIII Dominions own his Regal Sway; and so Archangels, Angels swiftly show Agilitie that from the DEITIE do's flow. LXXXIX Their Number's numberlesse, not half so few As orient Pearls of early Dew; Like Aromatick Lamps They in Heav'ns Temple shew: XC And yet of Them though vast the Number be, The Thing that most do's glorifie Their MAKER's This, They differ specifically. XCI Of the first Machine They the Parcels are; Yet, if we Them with GOD compare, Then w?? their Wings they skreen Themselves, though else most fair. XCII Lawlesse Desire do's never pierce their Breast; Th' Almighties Face is still their Feast; Their Blisse in Service lies, in Messages their Rest: XCIII They speak with Thought, atchieve without a Fee; Silence They hear, Idæas see; Still magnifying HIM, who cannot Greater be! XCIV Thus, They, with one fleet Glance intuitive, Into Each others Knowledge dive; And, by Consent, Thoughts, else inscrutable, unrive. XCV Each One in Psalms Eternity employes; Where Use nor tires, nor Fulness cloyes; Enjoying GOD, their End, without an end of Joyes! XCVI Each ravishing Voice, each Instrument, each Face Compos'd such Musick, that I was In Doubt, Each so in Tune, which did precede in Grace: XCVII The spritely Instruments did sweetly smile; The Faces play'd their Parts; mean while The Voices, with both Graces, did them Both beguile. XCVIII The Nine-fold Quire such Heav'nly Accents there In Sweets Extension still do rear, As over-pow'r the Windings of a mortal Ear. XCIX Who Musick hate, in barb'rous Discord rowle; In Heav'n there is not such a Soul; For, there's All-Harmony. Saints sing, the damned howl. C Cœlestial Sweets did this Discourse excite; Firm Joy, fast Love, fixt Life, fair Sight! But may a Creature, its CREATORS Glory write? Nunc alti Plumbum scrutatur Viscera Ponti, Viscera Navarchæ non repetenda Manu! Hinc, procul optatam divino Lumine Terram Cernimus, optatum perficiamus Iter! Te DEUM Laudamus. CANTO VII. The Contemplation. ARGUMENT. Pango nec humanis Opus enarrabile Verbis, Quæ meliùs possem Mira silendo loqui! Da, DEUS, Illa canam, quæ Vox non personet ulla, Metiar ut minimis Maxima Mira modis! She launcheth into shoarlesse Seas of Light, Inexplicable, Infinite! Whose Beams both strike her blinde, and renovate her Sight! I Were all Men Maro's, were those Maro's all Evangelists, met in Earths Hall For Grand-Inquest of That w?? we Eternal call: II Draw Time from's Cradle (Innocence) could They, And piled Heaps of Ages lay Amassed in one Scale; Those would they find to weigh, III Ballanc't with THEE, no more (when All is done) Than, if They vainly had begun To poize minutest atome with the Mighty Sun. IV Could They Earths Ball with Numbers quilted see; Yet, those throng'd Figures sum not THEE, They were but Cyphers to immense ETERNITIE! V Should every Sand for thousand Ages run, When emptyed Shoars of Sands were done, That Glass no more THEE measures, then if now begun! VI Had Tongues Heav'ns Mint, to coyn each Angel-Grace In Dialect; They'd fail o'th' Space, Where All to come is One with All that ever was! VII Faith, stretch thy Line, yet That's too short, to sound Sea without Bottom, without Bound; As Circular, as Infinite, ô Shoarlesse Round! VIII Immense ETERNITIE! What mystick Art Of THEE may coppy any Part, Since THOU an indeterminable CIRCLE art! IX Whose very Center so diffus'd is found, That not Heav'ns Circuit can It bound, Then what, what may the whole Circumference surround? X Heav'ns Hero's, can ye find for th' ENDLES End? Can Pow'rs IMMENSITY extend? UBIQUITIE inclose? The BOUNDLES comprehend? XI JEHOVAH's Zone to this uncentred BALL, Ecliptick, and Meridionall, Who Was before, Is with, and Shall be after All! XII But now behold Its Height, Above all Height! Plac't beyond Place! Above Lights Light! Rapt were the three Apostles by a Glimps o'th' Sight! XIII O, Thou all-splendent, all transcending Throne! Compact of High'st Dominion! That 'bove the Super-Eminence of Lustre shone! XIV From Each of Thine ineffably bright Sides Diffusion of such Splendor glides, As rowls 'bove thousand Seas of Joyes in flaming Tides XV With such Refulgence, that, if Cherubs might, With Face unvail'd, gaze on That Sight, Strait their Spiritual Natures would be nothing'd quite. XVI Nature, put on thy most coruscant Vest; Thy Gayeties shew, brought to this Test, As a crude Jelley dropt from duskie-Clouds at best. XVII Could'st Thou impov'rish every Indian Mine, And, from each golden Cell, unshrine Those Beams, that w?? their Blaze out-face Dayes em'lous Shine: XVIII Could'st finde out secret Engins to unlock The treasu'ring Casket of each Rock, And reap the glowing Harvest of that sparkling Shock: XIX Could'st thread the Stars (fixt and erratick) here, That stud the luminated Sphear, That all those Orbs of Light one Constellation were: XX Could'st joyn Mines, Gems, Skie-Tapers, All in one; Whose neer-Immense Reflection Might both outrival, and outvie the glorious Sun: XXI Could all thy Stones be Gems, Seas liquid Gold, Air Crystal, Dust to Pearl enrold, Each Star a Sun, that Sun more bright a thousand fold: XXII Yet would those Gems seem Flints, those Seas a Plash, Those Stars a Spark, That Sun a Flash; Pearl'd Islands, Diamond Rocks, Gold Mines, All sully'd trash: XXIII Yea, were all Eyes of Earth, Skie, Heav'n combin'd, And to one Optick point confin'd, This super-radiant Object would ev'n strike That blind! XXIV Blinde, as the sable, Veil of gloomy Night; (The Gospels Self but hints This SIGHT) All seem obscurer Shades to This non-parel LIGHT! XXV Amazing! Most Inexplicably Rare! O, if, but Those Who Worthy are, None may This Light declare; None may This Light declare! XXVI Best Eloquence is languid, high'st Thoughts vail, To think, to speak, Wit, Language fail; 'Tis an Abysse, through which no Spirits Eye can sail! XXVII Here Glory dwells, with Lustres so surrounded, That brightest Rayes are quite confounded, When they approach this radiant Eminence unbounded! XXVIII Forth from This Fulgurance such Splendors fly, As shall draw up frail Dust on High; Which, else, would in its lumpish Urn still bedrid lie. XXIX Before the Almighties Throne my Soul I throw, Whence All, that's Good and Great, does flow. LORD, I that Grace implore, w?? may this Glory show! XXX Great GOD! Thou All-beginning, Unbegun! Whose Hand the Web of Nature spun! At once the Plenitude of All, and yet but ONE! XXXI Parent of Beings, Entities sole Stud! Spirits eternal Spring and Flood! Sprung of Thy Self, or rather no way sprung! Chief Good! XXXII Abstract of Joyes, whose Wisdom an Abysse! Whose Pow'r Omnipotency is! Whose Soul-enlivening Sight's the Universal Blisse! XXXIII Thou dost descend on Wings of Air displaid, 'Bove Majesty It self arraid, Curtain'd with Clouds, the Host of Heav'n Attendants made! XXXIV Essence of Glory, Summity of Praise! Abasht at thy All-piercing Rayes, Heav'ns Quire does chaunt uncessant Alleluiahs! XXXV Diamonds than Glass, than Diamonds Stars more bright; Than Stars the Sun, than Sun Heav'ns Light; But infinitely purer than Heav'ns Self's Thy Sight! XXXVI Great is the Earth, more large the Airs Extent: Planets exceed; The Firmament Of Stars outvies; Unlimited's the Heav'nly Tent: XXXVII But, as my tenter'd Minde its Spirits still Strains forth, from lesse to more (LORD, fill My out-spent Raptures by thy All-repairing Skill!) XXXVIII When I above Air, Stars, Heav'n, on wou'd press Rackt Thoughts to Sphears beyond Exces; Myriads of Sphears seem Motes to thy Immense ONENESSE! XXXIX Eternity is but Thine Howerglasse! Immensity but fills Thy Space! Whole Natures six Dayes Work took up but six Words place! XL One Word did th' All-surrounding Skie-roof frame, With all its Starrie sparkling Flame! Not all created Wisdom can spell out THY NAME! XLI Supreme COMMANDER of the rowling Stars! Thy Law sets to their Progresse Bars, Does Epicycle their obliquely gliding Cars! XLII No Lines, Poles, Tropicks, Zones can Thee enthrall, First MOVER of the Sphearick Ball, Above, Beneath, Without, Within, Beyond them All! XLIII What could, but thy All-potent Hand, sustain Those Magazines of Hail, Snow, Rain, Lest They should fall at once, and deluge All again? XLIV By Them Thou Plenty dost to Earth distill; And Mans dependent Heart dost fill: Windes are Van-Curriers, &amp; Postilions to Thy Will! XLV 'Tis That the ominous Cause of Earth-quakes bindes In Subterranean Grotts; That findes Strange Ruptures to enfranchise th' ever-strugling Winds! XLVI Thy Sandy Cord do's proudest Surges bound; And Seas unfathom'd Bottoms sound; Thy semi-circling Bow i'th' Clouds thy Covenant crown'd! XLVII Earths Hinges hang upon thy Fiat; set Midst Air-surrounding Waters, yet Stand fixt on That, like Which, what is so Firm, so Great! XLVIII Yet Earths fast Columns at thy Frown do quake; And Oceans dreadful Horrors make; Flints melt, the Rocks do rowl, the airie Mountains shake! XLIX Yea, Heav'ns Self trembled, and the Center shook, With thy amazing Presence strook, When Power of Pow'rs on Sina's Mount His Station took! L Each Ens (as linkt to Providence, thy Chain) Is govern'd by thy Fingers Rein! Thou, seeing us, we Grace; we, Thee, do Glory gain! LI Who hast no Eyes to see, nor Ears to hear; Yet seest, and hear'st, All-Eye, All-Ear! Who, no where art contain'd, yet art Thou every where! LII The optick Glass we of thy Præscience may Call th' Ark, where all Idæas lay, By which each Entitie Thou dost at first pourtray! LIII Future Events are præexistent here, As if they lately acted were; Then any new dissect Anatomy more clear! LIV Each where, at once, Thou totally art still The same unchang'd; yet, at thy Will, Thou changest All; Who, though Thou art unmov'd, dost fill LV Things that are most remote; In whose Forecast Contingencies do crowd so fast, As if, past Things were now, and Things to come were past! LVI Though Acts on Earth crosse to thy Will are done, Besides thy Will yet acteth None; Preceding and succeeding Will, in Thee are One! LVII Of whose vast Mannor all the Earth's Demains! Though Earth, nor Air, nor Heav'n contains, Yet each obscurer Grott thy OMNIPRESENCE gains! LVIII Though nought accrues to Thy unbounded State From Spirits, which Thou didst create, Yet They thy Goodnes and thy Love shall still dilate! LIX Thou, who mad'st All, mad'st neither Sin, nor Death; Mans Folly first gave them their Breath; That did abase whole Nature with it self beneath. LX But Sin to cure, Thou in a Crib gav'st Man EMANUEL! Divine-humane! Who diff'ring Natures joyn'd; Whose Reign no Ages scan! LXI And Thou, O MEDIATOR! Thou, whose Praise, Like Morning Dewes, to first of Dayes Was sung by Heav'nly Choristers in Seraph Layes! LXII GOD, by the Holy Ghost, begat Thee, Lord! Flesh took by the Eternal Word! Whose Self-Eternal EMANATION None record! LXIII As thy Eternal EMANATION's past; So to Eternity shal't last! In the beginning was the Word, shews still THOU wast! LXIV There GOD in Essence, One in Persons Three! Here Natures two in One agree! Thou, sitting in the Midst of TRINAL-UNITY LXV At Heav'ns High Councel-Table, dart'st such Rayes, As strike ev'n Cherubs with amaze! Of which the School, disputing All, it nothing sayes. LXVI Search we the Ages past so long ago, None, None this Mystery could show, Till in that Maiden-Birth, 'twas acted here below! LXVII A Dove hatch't in that Nest Thy Self did build! A Lamb that Thine own Flock does shield! A Winter Flow'r that fram'd, from whence it sprung, the Field! LXVIII The Jewish Shepherds all affrighted are, When Heralds THEE proclaim'd i'th' Air! Yea, Magi came t' adore, led by a new-born Starre! LXIX Yet, though thus wond'rously begot, thus born, Sponsor for us, faln Race, forlorn, T' ingratiate us with GOD, becam'st to Man a Scorn! LXX The Grace Self wast, th' Honour t' Evangelize! The sacred Function, as a Prize, Thou took'st, yet That not on, till call'd in Aarons Guize! LXXI Which GOD t' Apostolize did bring to passe, By th' HOLY GHOSTS Descent, at Face Of Jordans then blest Streams, of Which John Witness was! LXXII Thence, led by th' HOLY GHOST to th'Wilderness, There tempted by the Fiends addresse, Him overcam'st by Scriptum est; Hence our Release! Then forth thou wentst.— LXXIII Thy Sermons, Oracles; Acts, Wonders were! Those Faith begot, These Others Fear! By Both, thus wrought in us, to THEE our selves we rear! LXXIV Thou gav'st the Lame swift Legs, the Blinde clear Eyes! Thou heal'dst all humane Maladies! Thou mad'st the Dumb to speak! Thou mad'st the Dead to rise! LXXV And art to Dead Men Life, to sick men Health! Sight to the Blinde, to th' Needy Wealth! A Pleasure without Pain! a Treasure without Stealth! LXXVI LORD, in, not of this World, Thy Kingdom is; Thy chos'n Apostles preacht thy Blisse, That none of all thy Creatures might Salvation misse. LXXVII Abra'ham, long dead before, yet saw Thy Day, In Isaack born, and Vowes did pay! Type first, then Antitype, and quicknest every way! LXXVIII Thy Gospel Wisdoms Academie shew'd; Thy Mercy, Justice calm'd; Life, view'd Is Temperance; Thy Death the Flag of Fortitude! LXXIX Thou, Altar, Sanctuary, Sacrifice, Priest, Bread of Life do'st All suffice! N'ere cloying Feast, where Appetite by Food doth rise! LXXX And, Son of Man, dost Sin of Man forgive! To be Thy Victimes Hearts do strive, Who liv'dst that Life might die, and di'dst that Death might live! LXXXI Yet dy'dst Thou not, but that (Spîrit quickned) free Thou might'st Saints Paradised see, Rejoyc'd Assurance give to Them rejoyc'd in Thee! LXXXII And that, from thence, to Satans gloomy Shades, Made Prison for the damned Hades, Thou might'st Thy Conquest shew, Thy Glory that ne're fades! LXXXIII Thence loos'd Deaths Chains from Body, up to rear It, That, when Rais'd State THOU dost inherit, THOU might'st become to us an ever-quickning SPIRIT! LXXXIV The FATHER to reveal gives to his SON Thee, HOLY GHOST (thus Three in One) Of All peculiar Sanctifyer, yet not Alone! LXXXV The Fathers Love, and Sons; Adoptions Seal, The Spring of Sanctitie, The Weal O'th' Church: Thy Self in Light of fiery Tongues reveal! LXXXVI O Light unscann'd! Of Wisdom every Glance Beams only from Thy Countenance; Whose Store, when empty'd most It self doth most advance! LXXXVII Whose Fruits are Gentleness, Peace, Love, and Joy, All crown'd with Blisse, free'd from Annoy; Which neither Time, World, Death, Hell, Devil can destroy! LXXXVIII Thou art a Feast, fram'd of that fruitfull Fare, Which Hungers wast not, but repair! A rich Perfume, no Windes can winnow into Air! LXXXIX A Light unseen, yet in each Place dost shine! A Sound no Art can e're define! A pure Embrace, that Times Assault can n'ere untwine! XC Flouds of unebbing Joyes from Thee do rowl! Which, to each Sin-disdaining Soul Thou dost exhibit in an unexhausted Bowl! XCI This Wine of Extasie, by th' SPIRIT giv'n, Doth raise the ravisht Souls to Heav'n! Affording them those Comforts are of Earths bereav'n! XCII Thy Union is as strict, as large thy Merit! No Heav'n but THEE, which Saints inherit Through Grace, divinest Sap, deriv'd by th' Holy Spirit! XCIII When Souls enflamed by that highest Light, Fix on Thy glorifying Sight, All Glories else, compar'd to That, are duskie Night! XCIV When high'st Infusions passe our highest Sense, Amazement is high Eloquence, 'Bove all Hyperboles which fall to Exigence. XCV Blest TRINITY, Th' art All; Above All, Good! Beatitudes Beatitude! Which swallows us, yet swim we in this Living Floud! XCVI Th' art King of Kings, of Lords Lord! None like Thee! Who, for thy Style hast Majestie! And for thy Royal Robes hast Immortalitie. XCVII Mercie for Throne! for Scepter Justice hast! Immensitie's for Kingdom plac't! And for thy Crown such Glorie as doth ever last! XCVIII For Peace, what passeth Understandings Eye! Pow'r, Irresistabilitie! For Holines, All what's most sacred, pure, and high! XCIX For Truth, thy Word! Wisdom for Counsellour! Omnipotence does Guard Thy Tow'r! Thou ministring Angels hast to act thy Soveraign Pow'r! C Omniscience Thine Intelligencer is! For Treasure Thou hast Endlesse Blisse! For Date Eternity! O, swallow me ABYSSE! Ite, pii Cantus, Cantus quibus arduus Æther Est Portus; Portum, quem videt alma Fides. Visuram Littus Navem, sacra Serta coronent, Serta per innumeros non peritura Dies! Gloria in excelsis DEO. CANTO VIII. The Admiration. ARGUMENT. Coeli trina MONAS, TRIAS una, faveto precanti! PERSONAS unâ Tres DEITATE colo! Sunt tria, sunt &amp; idem, Fons, Flumen, Gurges aquarum: Sic tria sunt unum, Sol, Jubar, atque; Calor. Th' Elixir centuplies It self. But, ô Myriads of Myriads must She so, T' express GODS Essence which no Intellect can show! I Projection to my Soul! Thy Sight's a Wreath Of Glory; Thou dost Virtue breath; Thy Words, like sacred Incense, Fuel, &amp; Flame bequeath. II Thou Maid of Honour in Heav'ns Court! to break Thy Gold-twist Lines shews Judgment Weak; Yet deign to hear my Suit; Of GODS hid Nature speak! III Can Counters sum up Infinite? Fond Man, Could'st grasp whole Oceans in thy Span, And Phœbus could'st out-face in his Meridian; IV Tear Rocks of Adamant, and scale the Wall O'th' glorious Empyræan Hall; And Worms to Super-Eminence of Seraphs call! V Yet This, ev'n then, thou could'st nor learn, nor teach: The World, unravell'd, cannot stretch To sound th' Abysse. It Self alone It Self can reach. VI Of all Intelligencies not all Light Mustred into one Optick Sight, Can speak what each where is, yet no where seen to th' Height! VII Who out of Nothing all Things did compact; Whose Will's His Work, whose Word his Act: Of Whom, who say's the most, must from His Worth detract? VIII How from the Essence the Creator flowes! Or how the Word, what Creature knowes! How th' Spirit, All in't, All from't, do's Heav'ns Assembly pose! IX Here they, who leave the Churches Ship, are tost Till irrecoverably lost! Whose Rudder is Gods Word, Steersman, th' Holy Ghost. X Archessence! Thou, Self-full! Self-Infinite! Residing in approachlesse Light! In the Incomprehensibilities of Height! XI Thy peerlesse uncreated NATURE is The Super-Excellence of BLISSE! Where Holiness &amp; Pow'r; where Truth &amp; Goodness kiss! XII Who only in THY SELF subsists, without Or Form, or Matter! yet, no doubt, Inform'st the Matter of the Universe throughout! XIII No Need compels THEE, no Disasters sad Disturb thy State, no Mirth makes glad; Oblivion takes not from THEE, nor can Mem'ry adde! XIV With prudent Rev'rence, Thus. What ere's in GOD, His Essence is; There's His ABode; Whose Will his Rule, whose Heav'n his Court, whose Hell his Rod. XV He exists an active ENS, uphoulding both It Self, and every Thing that doth Exist; without distinction or of Parts, or Growth! XVI Not made by Nothing, Nothing Nothing makes; Nor Birth from any Thing HE takes; For, what gives Birth, precedes: Springs usher in their Lakes. XVII Were He Material, then He local were; All Matter be'ing in Place; So, there Th' Incircumscriptible would circumscrib'd appear. XVIII He's so diffusive, that He's All in All! All in the Universall Ball! All out of It! The only Was, the Is, the Shall. XIX To help thy Reason, think of Air; there see Ubiquitie unseen, and free From Touch; Inviolable, though it pierced be. XX Meer Air corrupts not, though conveigh'd unto All Lungs; for, thither It does go To cool them; Quickneth All, as the Worlds Soul doth show: XXI Moysture and Heat, its Qualities, are Cause Of all Production: yet, because This Element's a Creature, GOD Creator pause. XXII Self-Life the Attribute of's Being is! His Will, of Governing! and His Command of Execution! and his Love of Blisse! XXIII All's ty'd in this Love-knot: JEHOVAH's Love. Times Birth the Trinitie do's prove: Creator made, Word spake, &amp; Spirit of GOD did move: XXIV Let us in our own Image Man create. Which, Salomon do's explicate; Remember the Creators in thy youthful State. XXV The Father spake, the Son i'th' Stream did move At his Baptizing; from Above The Holy Ghost descended in the Form o'th' Dove. XXVI Of Him, to Him, and through Him all Things be: Of, through, and to declare the Three; And in the HIM, the Unity of GOD we see. XXVII Thus Holy, Holy, Holy's nam'd, to show A Ternion we in Union know: The Notions issuing from the Trine, int' One do flow. XXVIII Whil'st that I think on THREE, I am confin'd To One! while I have One in Minde, I am let forth to Three! Yet Three in One combin'd! XXIX O, Inconceivable INDENTITIE! In One how may a Plural be! Coæqual both in Attributes, and Majestie! XXX The FATHER is true GOD i'th TERNION: The WORD unborn, yet after Son: The SPIRIT GOD Coessential; Three, cause Three from One! XXXI The Father &amp; Word are One! One, shews their Power: Are, distinct Persons. One does shour On Tritheits Vengeance: Are, does Arrians devour. XXXII One, yet not One! The Father and the Son In Persons two, from Father one By th' SPIRIT; Son is one by Resignation! XXXIII The Word is what He was; yet, once was not What now He is! for, He hath got A Nature more then once He had, to cleanse our Spot! XXXIV For, ne're had Man from Earth to Heav'n attain'd, Had GOD from Heav'n to Earth not deign'd His Son! now unto GOD Mans way by Man is gain'd! XXXV EQUAL, and Son, the form of Servant takes! The World, unmade by Sin, new makes! EQUAL, Son, Servant! All are Mysteries, not Mistakes! XXXVI Thus, by free Grace is Mans Defection heal'd: Behold the Mysterie reveald. WORD, Æqual; shado'wing, Son; Unction is Servant seal'd! XXXVII Because GODS ÆQUAL, Serpents Tempts are quell'd: Yet He, as Son, to Death must yeeld For us; by Resurrection to regain the Field. XXXVIII The SPIRIT is true GOD; from Ever He Did reign with Both! The TRINITIE Coequal, Coeternal, Coessential be! XXXIX The FATHER's full, though th' SON hath All engrost! Nor yet is ought of this All lost, Though th' FATHER give Him Self to th' SON by th' HOLY GHOST! XL For, though He freely thus give All his Store; Yet hath He Infinite, as before! Conceive for Glimps some endless Spring, or Mine of Ore! XLI What Soul will have this TRIAD for his Book, With Faith must on the Back-parts look, For, with His glorious FACE, blind are ev'n Seraphs strook! XLII By Speculation from Sols Substance, we The FATHER; from its Splendor see The SON; from's Heat the HOLY GHOST. Here, One is Three. XLIII The Intellect, the Memory, the Will Resemblance make o'th' TRINE; These fill One Soul, yet are distinct in outward Workings still! XLIV Thus, to restore from Fall, we may descrie THE TRINITY in UNITY! Inscrutable ABYSSE rebates our weaker Eye! XLV Be Ever-Ever-Ever blest, ô, TRINE! Ever Unitednesse divine! Who dost as well in Ants, as in Archangels shine! XLVI The Principats, Thrones, Dominations, all Archangels, Pow'rs Cœlestial Are Ministers attending on thy Soveraign Call! XLVII The Government 'bove Star-embroidred Hall, Thus truly is Monarchicall, Where All are Kings, and yet one King does rule Them All! XLVIII Lesse then the thousand Part I have exprest; Mans Weaknesse cannot bear the Rest. For thy Expresselesse Nature, LORD, be ever blest! XLIX Soul of all Sweets! my Love, Life, Joy and Bliss! To enjoy Thee's Heav'n! Hell Thee to misse! What's Earths! Ev'n Heav'n hath its Beatitude from This! L Remove the Needle from the Pole-Star, and 'Tis still with trembling motion fann'd, Till it returns. No Fixure but in GOD does stand. LI To Saints all other Objects prizelesse be; In GOD, the All of All, we see: Feast to the Taste, all Beauty to the Sight is He! LII Musick to th' Ear; and Those whom He unites, Partake with Him in high'st Delights! Spring-tides of Pleasures over-whelm their ravisht Sprites! LIII But, Contraries, when opposite, best show, (As Foils set Diamonds off, we know) See Hell, where Caitives pine, yet still their Tortures grow! LIV As Metals fierie Waves in Furnace swell, That Founders run, to cast each Bell; This, not endur'd; more Rage ten thousand Times is Hell! LV Where Souls still rave, adust with horrid Pain! They tug, they tear, but all in vain, For, them from raging Smart, Hope never shall unchain! LVI O, that for trash these Esaus sold their Blisse! For Sin, that worse than Nothing is! This desperates their Rage! How they blaspheme at This LVII This Viper clings, corrodes, 'gainst which no Ward! GODS Beatifick Sight debarr'd, Renders their Case, 'bove all the Pains of Sense more hard! LVIII O, never-sated Worm! unpity'd Woes! Unintermitted! what Sin owes, Hell payes! The Damn'd are Anvils to relentless Blowes! LIX Fiends forfeit not their Energie. There Cain Fries, but for one Lamb by him slain! O, what Flames then shall Butchers of Christs Flock sustain? LX Earths fatal Mischief, prosp'rous Thief, that Thunder Which tore the Nations all asunder, Whom Just Fate slew, i'th' Worlds Revenge, that conqu'ring Wonder, LXI That Ghost of Philips hot-brain'd Son may tell Heart-breaking Stories of his Hell! Too late He findes one Soul did his whole World excel! LXII There, curs'd Oppressors dreadful Rackings feel! Whose Hearts were Rocks, and Bowels Steel! O, scorching Fire! (cryes Dives) for one Drop I kneel! LXIII Oblig'd is Man, GODS Steward, to supply Brethren, in CHRIST Coheirs, who lie Gasping in stiff'ning Frosts, no Cov'ring but the Skie: LXIV Whose wither'd Skins, sear as the saplesse Wood, Cleave to their Bones, for want of food, Seem Natures Monsters thrown a Shoar by Mis'ries Flood. LXV Though all their Physick's but a Diet spare; Have no more Earth, than what they are, Nor more o'th' World, than Graves, yet in Heav'ns Love they share. LXVI Inestimable Love, from None bereav'n! Heav'n sunk to Earth, Earth mounts to Heav'n! Just Judge! to Dives Hell, to Laz'rus Heav'n is giv'n! LXVII Love, Disengage us of our selves! Love has Nor Bit, nor Reins! Rich, 'bove Earths Mass! Fixt in Idæas of Loves Soul-inliv'ning Grace! LXVIII O, Love! ô Height, above all Height, to Thine! Thy Favour did to Foes encline! Unmeasurable Measure! endlesse End of Line! LXIX Love darts all Thoughts to its Belov'd; doth place All Blisse in waiting on His Grace; It languisheth with Hope to view Him Face to Face! LXX And ushers in that Beatifick Love, Which so divinely flames Above, And doth to Vision, Union, and Fruition move! LXXI Ice is a thing distinct from th' Ocean wide; But, melted by the Sun, does glide Into't, becomes one with't, and so shall e're abide. LXXII Desire's a Tree, whose Fruit is Love, the Show'rs That ripen it are Tears, the Flow'rs Are Languors, Leaves Afflictions, Blossoms Pray'r-spent How'rs. LXXIII O, Mental Pray'r, thy Joyes are high! Resort By Thee's to GOD! Thou art the Port Of inward Peace from Storms! The Path to Sions Court! LXXIV By Pray'r GOD's serv'd betimes; Remember Who The Blessing got by Wrastling so; Who early pray, they healthy, holy, happy grow. LXXV Then pray, before Lights rosie Blush displayes I'th' Orient Sols enchearing Rayes, When He from's Opall East to West oblikely strayes: LXXVI Before the Cock, Lights Herald, Day-break sings To's Feathr'ie Dames; ere roost-Lark springs, Morns Usher; when the Dawn its mungrell hour forth brings. LXXVII Pray'r, Thou art Lifes best Act, Souls silent Speech, The Gate of Grace; Saints GOD beseech By Prayer, but joyn'd with Alms &amp; Fasts they HIM besiege! LXXVIII Fasting, the Souls delicious Banquet, can Adde Strength to Pray'r, feast th' inner Man, And throw up to Eternity the Bodies Span! LXXIX Fasts, sackcloth, ashes, groveling on the ground Saints study'd have with Pain, and found VVith Joy, that what degrades the Sense, in Heav'n is crow'nd! LXXX Prize Faith, the Shield of Martyrs, Joyes Confection, Souls Light, the Prophets sure Direction, Hopes Guide, Salvations Path, the Pledge of all Perfection! LXXXI In Faiths mysterious Eden make abode; VVith Jacobs Staff, and Aarons Rod Frequents its Grove, where none are but the Lov'd of GOD! LXXXII The Radiations of Faiths Lamp excite Such a Colosse of sparkling Light, That Saints, through worldly Waves may steer Lifes Course aright. LXXXIII Being in, not of this World, They Comforts rear Above the Pitch of servile Fear: Terrestrial Blossoms first must die, ere Fruit They bear. LXXXIV No clogging Fetters of impris'ning Clay, No wry-mouth squint-ey'd Scoff can stay Their swift Progression, soaring in their Heav'nly Way! LXXXV Thoughts on the endlesse Weight of Glory shall Render ev'n Crowns, as Dung, and all Afflictions light, as Chaffe chas'd on Earths empty Ball. LXXXVI The Torch that shines in Night, as Eye of Noon, Is but as Darkenesse to the Sun: Run after Shades, they fly; fly after Shades, they run. LXXXVII All worldly Gayes are Reeds, without Support, Fitly with Rain-bow gleames they sort, Want Solidnesse; when gain'd, they are as false, as short. LXXXVIII While Fooles, like silly Larkes, with Feathers play, And stoop to th' Glasse, are twitcht away, Amidst their pleasing Madnesse, to Hels dismall Bay! LXXXIX O, could embody'd Soules Sinnes Bane view well, Rather in Flames they'd choose to dwell! Not so much Ill, as Sin, have all the Paines of Hell! XC A smiling Conscience (wrong'd) does sweetly rest, Though starv'd abroad, within doth feast; Has Heav'n It self for Cates, has GOD Him Self for Guest! XCI May call Him FATHER; His Vicegerent be! An Atome of DIVINITIE! Redeem'd by's SON, by the SPIRIT, inspir'd, blest by ALL THREE! XCII His Judge becomes his Advocate! hath Care To plead for Him! The Angels are His Guardians! from his GOD Him Heights, nor Depths may scare. XCIII O, Blest, who in His Courts their Dayes do spend! And on that Soveraign Good depend! His Word, their Rule; his Spirit, their Light; Him Self their End! XCIV While Pride of Life, and Lust o'th' Eye do quite Dazle the World, Saints out of Sight Retire, to view their Blisse: On which some Canto's write: XCV For Souls, sincerely good, in humble Cell Encloystred, neer Devotions Bell, By Contemplations Groves and Springs neer Heav'n do dwell. XCVI Bright-gifted soaring Mindes (though Fortune trod) Are carelesse of dull Earths dark Clod; Enricht with higher Donatives; their Prize is GOD! XCVII Farewell. As vanisht Lightning then She flies. O, how in Me did Burnings rise! The only Discord was Farewell. Hearts out-reach Eyes. XCVIII The Air respires those quintessential Sweets From whence She breath'd, and who so meets With Such, the tuneful Orbs He in that Zenith greets. XCIX Dwell on This Joy, my Thoughts, re-act her Part; Such Raptures on thy shuddering Heart Make Thee all-Ecstasie by Spirit-seizing Art! C Chewing upon those Heav'n-enchanting Strains, My Soul Earths giddy Mirth disdains; Fleet Joy runs Races in my Blood through thousand Veins! Contingit gratam victrix Industria Metam; Et mea nunc Portu fessa potire Ratis. Est Opus exactum, Cujus non pœnitet Acti: Me juvat at Cæpti Summa videre mei. —Omnia in UNO, &amp; in Omnibus UNUS. Canto IX. The RECAPITULATION. And Pourtrait of a Heav'nly breathing Soul. Whoso delights to burn in holy Fire Of Virgin fair Theophila, Joy, Salamander, in that Flame; Thou so, Pirausta born, may'st like the Phœnix burn, That to Eternitie thou rise, Not losing Life, but sowing well the same: A holier Ovids smoothed Verse With Eyes of Heart, with Heart-all-Eyes, behold: Such sacred Flames by Adamantine Hand Ought to be plac't in lasting Urns; But, 'cause these Writings needed Aid of Pens, Virtue, than Birds more swift, unto the Scribe lend Wing, And let the Readers Care more Eyes than Argus bring. The PORTICO. Love to the Master, and the Mate Stirs it self feebly in Lifes lowest Sphear; That to our Parent, and the Bed More large extends, and breathes a Life of Sense; That to our Countrey, and its Sire Self raises loftier in Reasons Air: But, That to GOD, Ravisht with Ecstasie, It self transcends, Nor Bounds, nor Limits would It own; But, narrow'd That (like Lovers, kept apart) Warms, heats, yea boyls, boyls up and over! Longs for th' Eternal, sighs for Him, beyond that Lover! THE ARGUMENT. Blest Muse the Altar builds, where Love's ador'd; And throweth down, loose Wit, thy Nest abhorr'd: She, Clytie-like, to th' Sun of Glory turns; GOD is her Sun, with Light of Zeal She burns. 1 Mvse, canst be silent, when each charmed Grove, Harbours a thousand warbling Notes of Loue? 2 Art whets the Minde, and Hymns set Edge on Art: Dart up an Epod; Zeal, crown thou the Dart. 3 Hope be thy Bowe, thy Hand Love, Faith the Shaft; Let Hope shoot Faith to God with Loves strong Draft. 4 Sacred's my Theme; may my first Fruits Him please! Faith plants, Hope nourishes, Love ripens These. 5 This World's the Field, GOD sows, his Word the Seed, Satan the Thief, the Good, Corn, th' Ill the Weed. 6 Lord, mount me to the Pitch of Larks on High; That I, as Birds wing'd Oars, may cut the Skie! 7 Saints would know GOD, so, as they Good may doe: Let me both know this Good, and act It too! 8 Heav'ns Love, not knowledge doth the Palm acquire: Who Heav'nly Knowledge gave, will give Desire. 9 That Ought I will, can, am, is, Christ, from Thee: Christ, what I am, can, will, accept from me! 10 No Light, Tast, Strength without Thee; Thou alone Art Health unto my Soul, my Salt, my Sun. 11 Thou, Light, Way, Life; who sees, walks, liveth by That Flame, Path, Strength, does not fall, fail, nor die. 12 Upon thy Altars let my Verses prove The Victime, Heart the Altar, the Fire Love! 13 Pray'r Frankincense, Tears Myrrhe, be Gold, Souls Health: The Minds best Work, Hearts Laver, &amp; Loves Wealth. 14 I This Verse-Hecatomb to Thee do bring; As Solomon his numerous Offering. 15 The pious Muse courts Heav'n; when highest Things She soars for, still She craves, Blest Dove, thy Wings! 16 With active Plumes flye up to th' Angel-Quire, Where Chrysolites to gild thy Way conspire. 17 Love may Them lead by Verse, whom Sermons fright; Bring Them, where Faith comes not, into Heav'ns Light. 18 O may our Numbers in sweet Musick flow; Nor the least Harshnesse of Elisions know! 19 Shade me, ô Lord! I seek not Virgils Tree; Hence Springs prophane; Glide, Siloam, by me! 20 Trampling vain Labours, with loose Wits defil'd, The Hallow'd Brain brings forth a Spritely Childe. 21 What's Life? a Vapour; Beauty? Ashes; Gain? An Idol; Honour? Bubble; the World? vain: 22 Life flits away, and Beauty wanes at full, Gold cheats, and Honour fades, the World is dull. 23 Lifes Pleasure's short, and Pleasures Life is vain; It knowes not highest Blisse, GODS Love, to gain. 24 That Torch which flam'd so bright in Hero's Room, Did light her lov'd Leander to his Tomb. 25 To Death a thousand Wayes, to Life but one: For Sin who groans not, he for Sin shall groan. 26 Arm'd Wrath perfidious Tyrants throwes from high; They conquer Right, Sin Them; Th' Avenger's nigh. 27 Sinners first Steps, Sins Seed, and Fruit avoid; Many by neer Infection are destroy'd. 28 Kill Vice i'th' Egge: John, Joseph, Robelesse fly; Peter, Thou stay'st, and stay'st but to deny! 29 By Night and Day, at Home, and when Abroad, Guilt stings the Soul, and thereon layes its Load! 30 Of Decalogue, Creed, Supper of the LORD, Though Laws speak loud, our Church hath scarce a Word! 31 Hence Flocks are pin'd. The Judge in Time will come Unthought of: Neer to Guilt's the Avengers Doom! 32 Nor Pray'r, nor Price, nor Fraud, nor Rage, nor Art Can help; Ah, fear then Flames eternal Smart! 33 Wet-cheekt, how oft I've moan'd to Thee my Dear, All Night awake, alone, ô Cure, appear! 34 Seest Thou, and suff'rest? Stop Sins Course, &amp; Birth; Let not that Hand bear Arms, that sowes the Earth. 35 Loves Pow'r's infus'd from God, a free-giv'n Grace; Theophila from Love takes Name and Race. 36 Thou burn'st, pierc't Theophil, with firie Dart; If blessed Heat enflames thy vigorous Heart, 37 The more Thou burn'st, the more be Bellows still; As thy Flames grow, Let those Flames Others fill! 38 Heat the Luke-warm, to Those, more hot, give Fire; Bless GOD; Refresh with Grace, enflame Desire. 39 The Poets Pharos be that sets forth sail, While he steers sheet-fill'd with a holy Gale. 40 Pure Wit's the Sails, quick Judgement Oars, Thou th' Star, Pilot the Scribe, Sea Vein, the Ship Hymns are. 41 I give Wits Tackling to thy guiding Hands: Honour in giving, Love in taking stands. 42 Binde up what's loose, what's rash new-mold, refell What's ill, lame help, smooth rough, depress what swell. 43 Thou slight'st Earths ratling Squibs, with Sulphur fill'd: Kingdoms such Nests are as the Birds do build. 44 Above all Worldly Wealth thy Riches rise; Thy Microcosm the Macrocosm out-vies. 45 Thou lay'st out hoarded Gold the Poor to aid; So, with GODS Love, thy Love to GOD's repaid. 46 Thy sacred Skill imparted Reverence breeds; Thy Worship's Practise, and thy Words are Deeds. 47 Fiends Hate, Saints Prize, whence Lyrick Strings sound clear, Of spotless Faith, pure Minde, to th' Highest dear. 48 The Emerald-Grove envies thy golden Hair, Whose Curls make Graces blush Themselves more fair. 49 As many Joyes thy starry Beauties shed, As Bees in Attis, Gems in Skies are spred. 50 The Diamond sparkleth Rage at thine Eye-Beams, Whose chast Orbs brandish thence their sacred Gleams. 51 The Coral Die is blankt at Lips so red, And livid Grapes at rosie Cheeks hang head: 52 I'd gaze o'th' Lili'd Cheek, and the Lips Rose, But ô, thy Cheek, thy Lip surpasseth those! 53 Grace pours sweet-flowing Words from charming Lips, Sparkling 'bove Nectar which i'th' Crystal skips. 54 Rare Psaltresse, with Heav'n-drops inebriate, What Sweets to Mouth, and Ear dost Thou create? 55 Sweet Violets, Saffron, Balm, Myrrhe from Thee flowes, Bdell, Incense, Cedar, Cinn'amon, Nard, the Rose. 56 The Rose, Swains Spice: Such Heav'n-dew'd Verse dost frame, As sweet as Honey-comb, as bright as Flame. 57 While Combs, and Flames divine from Thee are cast, I'm fed, as fir'd; Ev'n Flames do nurse my Taste! 58 The Swan pines at thy Neck; This Milkie Way Doth Steps, begun to th' Holy LAMB, display. 59 There fals on thine Alp-Breasts a lasting Snow, To which Snow's black, Swans foul, the Goose a Crow. 60 The hoary Frost turns Durt, vi'd with thy Hand, And, where thy Fooot does tread, it prides the Land. 61 On Lilies Milk, on Violets Purple throw, On Saffron Gold, Scarlet o'th' Rose bestow; 62 Wreaths, worthy Thee, fair Flora ne're can weave; Nor can our highest Strains Thee higher heave. 63 With all-bred Flowr's, &amp; glitt'ring Buds Thou beam'st; As if t' have cropt all Paradise Thou seem'st. 64 Each Vertue's in thy Life, so pois'd, so fine; What's first? This? That? or T'other? since All shine. 65 Love to thy Soul deriv'd is from Above, Where Honour reigns, sparks Beauty, triumphs Love. 66 In Chymick Art Thou my Elixir be; Convert to Gold the worthlesse Dross in me. 67 Fire makes of Ashes Glass, makes Metals shine; This Fire my Body may to Spirit calcine. 68 Enamour'd Ir'on does to the Magnet flie; Yea Sparks in hardest Flints concealed lie. 69 Nothing more hard than Stone, more soft than Fire; Yet Stones are melted by inflam'd Desire. 70 Is't so? Who'd not dissolve in Flames of Love? Be Thou the Grace, Thou my Thoughts Loadstar prove. 71 Mindes Gemme, Eyes Apple, Hearts intenser Flame; Thou shew'dst the Way, I'll prosecute the Same. 72 For GOD created, bright in Virtues Train, Weigh'st Right, quell'st Passions, &amp; o're Deeds dost reign. 73 GOD is thy Life, Law Virtue, Glorie CHRIST; Him, who leads Thee by Love, Thou lov'st Him high'st. 74 CHRIST, to endure the Cross, what did Thee move? The Pledge of Bitterness was Pledge of Love! 75 Is GOD both Meat, and Lover? CHRIST thy Food? What Banquet is This Lover! As Sweet, as Good! 76 CHRIST's Spice (Thou say'st) Light, Triumph, Praise to me; Musick, Wine, Feast, Fame, Crown, GOD; All to Thee. 77 LORD, Thou art All in All! Thou lost, All's nought; How base seems muddy Earth, where Heav'n is sought! 78 Earth's Exile, Death the Gate, my Home's Above; My Staff's Hope, Faith Companion, Leader Love. 79 Turn Indie into Jewels, Heav'n to Verse, Nor Indie can thy Worth, nor Heav'n reherse. 80 Let me Thee fear, and love; Fear Loves Heat blowes; Fear is Devotions Fount, whence Love o'reflowes. 81 Thy Word's my Rule, I cleave to Thee, my Vine; LORD, Thou art All to me, I'm wholly Thine. 82 O, hear my Pray'r, my Suff'rings bear, my Task Take off, redresse my Wrongs, grant what I ask! 83 With Pray'r, Desire, Faith, Zeal, Hope, Deed I call, Laud, seek, love, pray, worship Thee All in All. 84 If I behold Thee, I'm all flaming Spice; If not behold Thee, I'm congeal'd to Ice! 85 Adde Flames to Flames, that I may melt away! Be I belov'd of Thee, or else Deaths Prey! 86 Sweet Seas, light Yoke, a friendly Flame I finde, Which me with Love doth drown, and burn, and binde. 87 I'm not mine own, but faint for GOD above! Rose-deck me Virgins, for I'm sick of Love! 88 Nought of a Liver, hath a Lovers Heart; Or, live belov'd, or Life-bereft, depart! 89 Let us be One! In One, Two melted flow! Let one Life, as one Love, inform us Two! 90 My only Joy, I'm Thine; Thou mine; and Both The like Flame burns; Th' One loves, as t' Other doth. 91 Fire! Fire! Love is Belov'd! My Maker's mine! Loving, I'm lov'd! while with my Spouse I twine! 92 O Love belov'd! Her, who such Joyes partakes, Silence makes Wonder, Wonder Silence makes! 93 To Heav'n I live, to Earth I die; dying rise! So, Hell being chain'd, Love takes the Victors Prize. 94 Lovers so love, as for the Lov'd to die! As Stradas Lute was Life and Destinie. 95 If these my Layes have either Light, or Name, Name from thy Word, Light from thy Grace doth flame. 96 Who came a Mole, goes Argus hence by Love; I shall Faiths Priest to hopefull Charis prove. 97 Theophilas Bayes to Me more Honour brings, Than Gems that blaze on the proud Heads of Kings. 98 For what boot worldly Crowns with Souls losse bought, Heights fall, spruce Courtship fades, Vice brings to nought. 99 We may hereafter, as we now have found The Voice of Fame above, so, under Ground. 100 The Last shall last; Term can't Vacation lend To th' Lover; Here 'tis End to have no END. To see, not know, is not to see: Then, let our English Reader be Warn'd, not on Latian Alps to roam; The next Vales path will lead Him home. Upon the Vanitie of the World. Long have I sought the Wish of All To finde; And what it is Men call True Happiness; But cannot see The World hath It, which It can be, Or with It hold a Sympathie. He that enjoyes what here below Frail Elements have to bestow, Shall finde most sweet bare Hopes at first; Fruition by Fruition's burst, Sea-water so allayes the Thirst. Who ever would be happy then, Must be so to Himself; for, when Judges are taken from without, To Judge what we are, fenc'd about, They do not judge, but guesse, and doubt. His Soul must hug no private Sin; For, that's a thorn conceal'd i'th' Skin; But Innocence, where She is nurst Plants valiant Peace; So, Cato durst Ev'n then be best, when Rome was worst. God-built He must be in his Minde; That is, Divine; whose Faith no Winde Can shake; when firmly Herelics Upon the ALMIGHTY, He outflies Low Chance, and Fate of Destinies. As Fountains rest not till they lead, Meandring high, as their first Head: So, Man rests not till He hath trod Deaths Height: then, by that Period, He rests too, rais'd in Soul to GOD. Owen Feltham Storms on the Minde from Honours Hill descend; Titles external Beams adde not to Blisse: The Poor wants much, the Covetous All. My Soul, No painted Praise, nor flowr'd Encomiums prize Equal to pious Breathings of pure Love: Eschew the petty Pleasures of the Time, And Heav'ns Refreshments make thy Jubilie: Imagine not to swim in worldly Pomp, And afterwards to reign with Christ in Blisse; Earth must be Gall, that God may Honey prove: He the best Relish hath of Heav'n, who most Disdains the base Licentiousness o'th' Age; We must be empty'd of our Selves, before We can have Entrance into th' Heav'nly Court: If we desire Fruition of the Sun, Then must our Backs upon the Shade be turn'd; Disclaim'd by Christ are those the World doth love, And those whom Christ do's love, the World contemns: He of his Greatnesse doth Himself divest, Who goes from God, and Creature-comforts seeks. O, what a mean dispised thing is Man, Unless he raise Himself above the Earth, Since nought but his Creator makes him high! Let's think't no Shame t' endure what Christ endur'd, Nor glory to do that which Judas did; Dead to the World, let's be alive to God, Who gain his Favour are supremely blest: This is the Height of Wisdom, to desire Those things in Life, which Thou wouldst dying crave: Then on the Thoughts of Death thy Lamps Oyl spend, And muse upon that State which nere shall end. THE VANITIE OF THE VVORLD. CANTO X. The Abnegation. ARGUMENT. What's potent Opulencie? What's remiss Voluptuousness? World, what's All This, To That the Soul's created for, Eternal Blisse? I Various are Poets Flames; Some, Eclogues write, Others describe a horrid Fight, Some Lyrick Strains, and some the Epick do delight: II But, here my sharpned Muse shall entertain The Scourges of Satyrick Vein, To lash the World, in which such Store of Vices reign. III No Grandee Patron court I, nor entice Love-glances from enchanting Eyes, Nor Blandishments from lisping Wantons vocall Spice. IV No such trite Theams our fired Genius fit, Of which so many Pens have writ: Prudential Souls affect sound Reason, not sleight Wit. V Blest Talents which the Gospels Pearl do buy: Frail Hopes that on the World rely, Where None are sav'd by Faith, but by Infidelitie. VI The way to gain more Ground, is to retreat; Our Flight will be our Foes Defeat; Minds conqu'ring great Delights, triumph in Joyes more great: VII Pull me not, World; nor can, nor will I stay; Jugler, I know what thou canst say: Thy magick Spells charm easie Sense but to betray. VIII Wits toil to please Thee, Sables yield their Skins; The Silk-worm to thy Ward-robe spins; Rocks send their Gems, Seas Pearls, to purvey for thy Sins. IX Thou brightnest Cupboards with throng'd massy Plate; Heap'st Ermin'd Mantles of Estate; Shew'st rich caparison'd champing Coursers at thy Gate. X Thou cull'st of Natures Spoil from Air, Earth, Seas, The wing'd, hoof'd, finnie Droves, to please Gluttons, who make themselves Spittles of each Disease. XI And shall, like Dives, a sad Reckning pay; Feasts hastned on his Fun'ral Day; Death brought the Voider, and the Devil took away. XII Tell me no more, Th' art sweet, as spicie Air; Or, as the blooming Virgin, fair; And canst with jovial Mirth resuscitate from Care. XIII Boast not of Rubie-Lips, and Diamond-Eyes, Rose-Cheeks, and Lilie-Fronts, made Prize, With dimpled Chins, the Trap-pits where a Fondling lies. XIV Deaths Serjeant soon thy courted Helens must Attach, whose Eyes, now Orbs of Lust, The Worms shall feed on, till they crumble into Dust. XV Boast, World, who unto Revels dost decoy Thy Fav'rites, that they'r bath'd in Joy; Disdaining Saints, who pretious Time in Pray'r employ: XVI Who, where they come, with purer Rayes of Light, Dazle thy bat-ey'd Legions quite, Rage, Impudence, and Ignorance, the Imps of Night. XVII Fool, thy Attractives, in no Limits pent, Indulge to Surfets, not Content, And, but illude the Minde, not give It Ornament. XVIII Gild o're thy bitter Pills with guilefull Arts; Sweet Potions brew for frolick Hearts: When most thou smil'st, thou actest most perfidious Parts. XIX With Thee dwells fawning Craft, and glozing Hate, Th' Allurements of Imperious State, Which, Barks, like Calms, invite unto a Shipwrackt Fate. XX Guile, rule the World, that doth in Madness roul: Great Things the Better oft controul, Where Pride is coacht, Fraud shopt, &amp; Taverns drown the Soul. XXI Follie in ruffling Storms with Frenzie meets, Ebbing, and flowing ore the Streets O'th' care-fill'd pompous Citie, which exiles true Sweets. XXII O fretting Broyls in populous Bussle pent, Where still more Noise than Sense they vent, And, now as much to Gold, as, late to Battles bent! XXIII World, reason if thou canst. Thy Sports leave Stings; Thy Scenes, like Thee, prove empty Things; Thou glorious seem'st in Paint, from whence all Falshood springs. XXIV So, Rainbow Colours on Doves Necks have shone In Hiew so divers, yet so one, That Fools have thought them all, the Wiser knew them none. XXV I'l countercharm thy Spells, that Souls, e're thee, May trust wilde Irish Seas; Who flee Distrest to thy Relief, Thou say'st; What's that to me? XXVI Fawn, and betray, and Treasons self outdare, T' o'rethrow by raising is thy Care, But I'l ungull thy Minions, undisguize thy Ware. XXVII Thy Gold's Drosse, glitt'ring Troubles are thy Bliss, By Pomp thou cheat'st, thy All's amiss: Thou art Sins Stage, the Devil prompts, Flesh Actor is. XXVIII Spectator-Sense applauds each witching Gin, But, unto Reasons Eye within, Thou seem'st Hells Broker, and the servile Pimp of Sin. XXIX Thus Peaches do rough Stones in Velvet tire; Thus rotten Sticks mock Starrie Fire; Thus Quagmires with green Emeralds crown their cheating Mire. XXX So, Mermaids lovely seem in Beauties Guize, With Voice, and Smiles, draw Ears, and Eyes, But whom they win, they sink; those never more shall rise. XXXI Thy Shop's but an Exchange of apish Fashion, Thy Wealth, Sports, Honours are Vexation, Thy Favors glistring Cares, sweet Surfets, woo'd Damnation. XXXII Base Proverbs are thy Counsels to enthrall. Each for himself, and God for All: Young Saints (I dread to speak it) to old Devils fall. XXXIII Rain on thy Darlings Head a Danaen Shour, Let him be drencht in Wealth, and Poure; What then? Th' hast storm'd, &amp; seiz'd on All in one short hour. XXXIV O, thou Prides restless Sea! swoln Fancies blow Thee up, dost blew with Envie grow, Brinish with Bloud, like the Red Sea, with Lust dost flow. XXXV Remorceless Rage! thou in thy fift Acts Breath, When Bloud does freeze to Ice of Death, And Life's jail'd up for Natures Debt, where art? Beneath. XXXVI World, ev'n Thy Name a whirling Storm implies, Where Men, in Generations rise, Like Bubbles, dropsy'd Bladders of the rainie Skies. XXXVII Some strait sink down, whom Waters Sheet do's hide; Some, floating up and down, abide; The longest are so circumvolv'd, as Rest's deny'd. XXXVIII So, have we rid out Storms, when Eol's Rave Plough'd up the Ocean, whose each Wave Might waken Death with Noise, and make its Paunch a Grave. XXXIX The sick Ship groan'd, fierce Windes her Tacklings rent; The proud Sea scorn'd to be Shoar-pent; VVe seem'd to knock at Hell, and bounce the Firmament. XL Clouds then ungilt the Skies, when Lightnings Light Flasht thousand glimmering Dayes t'our sight, But Thunders Canons soon turn'd those flasht Dayes to Night. XLI Thus art thou, World, Lifes Storm, at Death Distress; Starving's the Bottom of Excesse: Thy Self a piteous Creature, how can'st me redress? XLII No: had'st lesse cruel been, th' hadst been less kinde; Oyl's in thy Gall to heal my Minde: Thus Hell may help to Heav'n, Satan a Soul befriend: XLIII A good Cause with good Means some use, yet fare But ill, when Others, of thy Care, Whose Cause is bad, and Means ill us'd, successful are. XLIV No Wonder Sins Career, uncheckt, runs on, Since here Lifes Joy it hath alone, Which, though thou bragg'st is giv'n, no sooner's giv'n, than gone. XLV Pomp, Pleasure, Pelf, idolatriz'd by Fools, Dispute we now in Wisdoms Schools: Ambitions quenchless Fire i'th' Spring of Judgment cools. XLVI Pride bladders tymp'nous Hearts, till prickt by Fear, Soon they subside by venting there: Unsafe Ascents to Pow'r do watching Dangers rear. XLVII Fearfull, and fear'd is Pomp; Ambition steep Does Envie get, and Hatred keep; High State wants Station; Honour-thirsting Minds can't sleep. XLVIII Summon Aspiro, with his Looms of State To weave Prides Web, in spite of Fate; Who, once got up, throwes down the Steps did elevate. XLIX He hates Superiors, 'cause Superiors, and Inferiors, lest they's Equals stand; And on his Fellows squints, that are in joynt Command. L Th' Ambitious treach'rous are, and hoodwinkt quite; Their giddy Heads have dazled Sight, For, Jealousie clothes Truth in double Mists of Spite. LI His Eye must see, and wink; his Tongue must brave, And flatter too; his Ear must have Audience, yet carelesse be: Thus acts he King &amp; Slave. LII So, brightest Angel blackest Devil hides; High'st Rise to lowest Downfall slides; A Mathematick point thus East and West divides. LIII Bright Wisdom sends dark Policie to School, Proves the Contriver but a Fool, Who builds his Maxims on a Precipice, or Pool. LIV Great Ones, keep Realms from Want; They'l you from Hate: Life's not so dear as Wealth; For, That Holds single Bodies, This the Body of the State. LV Who bad Desires conceive, they soon wax Great With Mischief, then bring forth Deceit, So, brood They Desolation, till it grows compleat. LVI Let such as sail 'gainst Virtues Winde, use Skill To tack about; for, what's first Ill, Grows worse by Use, and worst by Prosecution still. LVII Ev'n That to which Prides touring Project flies, When graspt, soon by Fruition dies: Great Fears, great Hopes, great Plots, great Men make Tragedies! LVIII Achitophel and Absalon prov'd This, Whose Brains of their Designs did misse; Teaching deep Machavels; Fraud worst to th' Plotter is. LIX Fallacious They, and fallible have been, Who made Religion cloak their Sin: Mans greatest Good, or greatest Ill is from Within. LX Those Policies that hunt for Shadowes so, As let at last the Substance go, Which ever lasts, make wretched End in endless Wo. LXI Had'st for thy Householdstuff the Spoil of Realms, Could'st thou engross Cathaiahs Gems, And more then triplicate Romes triple Diadems; LXII Could'st with thy Feet toss Empires into Air, And sit i'th Universall Chair Of State; were Pageants made for Thee the whole Worlds Mayor; LXIII Yet those but Pageants were; Thou, Slave to Sense; To him, not's own, all Things dispence But Storms; Thou happier wast i'th' Preterperfect Tense. LXIV Steward, give up th' Account, the Audit's neer To reckon how, and when, and where; Where much is lent, there's much requir'd: Dooms Day's severe. LXV Thus, proud Ambition is by Conscience peal'd; Vapours sent up, a while conceal'd, In thundring Storms pour down at length, when All's reveald. LXVI Though Prides high Head doth brush the Stars, yet shall Its Carkass like a Sulphur Ball, Plunge into Flames Abyss. Pride concav'd Satans Hall. LXVII The Mighti'st are but Worms; pale Cowards they Abasht shall stand at that Great Day, When Conscience, King of Terrors, shall their Crimes display. LXVIII Giants of Earth, Aviso's may you tell, That though with envy'd State you swell, Yet, soon within Corruptions Charnel-house you'l dwell. LXIX Scepters are frail, as Reeds: who had no Bound, Are claspt within six foot of Ground; Whose Epitaphs next Age will be Oblivion found. LXX Such Yesterday, as would have been their Slave, To day may tread upon their Grave, That flats the Nose: Best Lectures dust-seel'd Pulpets have. LXXI Who tost the Ball of Earth, in dark Vaults rest: All what that Gen'rall once possest Was but a Shirt in's Tomb, who vanquisht all the East. LXXII Invading Cyrus in a Tub of Gore, Might quaff his Fill, who evermore Had thirsted Blood: Him timeless Fate midst Triumphs tore. LXXIII Weigh Things; Life's frail, Pomp vain; remember Paul, (The way to rise will be to fall) In's high Commission low, in's low, Conversion, tall. LXXIV Soul, w'udst aspire to th' High'st? clip Tumors Wing; To th' Test of Heav'n thy Axioms bring: Best Polit'ick David was. Who conquers Sin's the King. LXXV Let raised Thoughts, Elijah-like, aspire To be encharioted in Fire: Faith, Love, Joy, Peace, the Wheels to Saints sublime Desire. LXXVI Avaro cite, as void of Grace, as stor'd With Gold, the God his Soul ador'd; Wealth twins with Fear: Why start'st? Unlock thy unsunn'd Hord: LXXVII I'l treble't by the Philosophick Stone; This makes thee stare. Why, thus 'tis done, To Passives Actives joyn in due Proportion. LXXVIII Behold vast Sums unown'd! Thou hutch-cram'd Chink, Art made as Nothing with a Wink, Thou, bred from Hell, with Hell-deeds Souls to Hell dost sink. LXXIX Gold is the Fautress of all civil Jarres, Treasons Reward, the Nerve of Wars, Nurse of Prophaneness, suckling Rage that Kingdoms marres. LXXX Thou potent Devil, how dost thou bewitch The dreggy Soul, spott'st it with Itch! This Slave to thee, his slave, was never poor, till rich. LXXXI Now chest th' all worshipt Ore with rev'rend Awe; Sols Gold, and Luna's Silver draw (Should Hell have these, 'twould plunder'd be) to sate thy Maw. LXXXII While Gripes of Famine mutiny within, And tan, like Hides, the shrivel'd Skin O'th' Poor, whose pining Want can not thy Pitty win: LXXXIII Having their Gravestones underneath their Feet, Breath out their Woes to All they meet, While thou to them are flintier than their Bed, the Street. LXXXIV Blinded with Tears, with crying hoarse, forlorn They seem to be of All, but Scorn: Death than Delay (Wants bloudless Wound) is easier born. LXXXV Thy Dropsie breeds Consumption in thine Heir; Who thus t' himself;—I'l ease your Care, Measure not Grounds, but your own Earth: Die now to spare. LXXXVI What's rak'd by Wrong, and kept by Fear, when mine, Shall spread, as I'm—Then brood the Shine, Penurious Wretch, till thou by empty Fulnesse pine. LXXXVII Thy Care's to lessen Cost; how slow thy Payes! How quick Receipts! Lov'st Fasting-Dayes, But 'tis to save; thus starv'st in Store, thee Plenty slayes. LXXXVIII When shall I rifle every Trunk and Shelf Of this old muckie wretched Elf, Who turns, as Chymists do, all that he scrapes, to Pelf? LXXXIX O, sordid Phrenzie! Anxious Maze of Care! O, gripple Covetize to spare, And dream of Gold! The Misers Heav'n, the Indians Snare. XC Oppression is the Bloud-shot in their Eyes; Bribes blanch Gehesa till he dies: Fool, read, this Night Death may thy dunghil Soul surprize. XCI Think not for whom thou dost thy Soul deceive, And injur'd Nature so bereave; But still thy knotty Brain with wedg-like Anguish cleave. XCII Sruck blinde with Gold, brood on thy Rapines, till Thou hatch up stinging Cares to th' fill: The heaviest Curso on this side Hell's to thrive in Ill. XCIII Go, venture for't with Sharks; haste, Miser old To th' Hook, because the Bait is Gold: Pawn thy Soul for't, as Judas did, when's Lord he sold. XCIV Possessors are as Saul possest, who crosse Heav'ns Law; Gain, got by Guile, proves Losse; Getting begits more Itch; Lusts specious Ore is drosse. XCV Who sowe to Sin shall reap to Judgement; Train To Hell is Idolized Gain. Canst Death, or Vengeance bribe? If not, dread ceaseless Pain. XCVI Why so fast poasted by thy strugling Cares, And Self-slaying Fraud, with all their Snares? Stay, view thy self; Destruction her crackt Glass prepares. XCVII His pursie Conscience opens now. I've run On Rocks (he houls) too late to shun, Lost Use, and Principle! Gold, I'm by Thee undone! XCVIII If, to exhort be not too late, attend The wholsom Counsel of a Friend, Renounce thy Idol, and prevent thy wretched End. XCIX Sound for Faiths Bottom with Hopes anch'ring Cord; Repent, Restore, large Alms afford, The dismall Fraught of sinking Sins cast over-board. C He who returns to 's Avarice left, his Sore Growes desp'rate, Deadlier than before, His Hopes of Heav'n much lesse, his Fears of Hell much more. Oceani Monstrum natat infrænabile, Lingua; Naves sæpè pias hæc Echeneis habet; Cui paro Naumachiam, Freta conturbata pererrans, Sit Remoq; meo, Lis, Remoræque tuæ. —Spes rebus affixa fugacibus, uno Frangitur Afflatu? THE VANITIE OF THE VVORLD CANTO XI. The Disincantation. ARGUMENT. Crispulus hic, nulli Nugarum Laude secundus, Cui Mens Lucis inops, Stulta Ruina Domûs; Qui Cereri, Bromioque litat, Luxuque liquescit; Huic ne putrescat, pro Sale Vita datur. Volupto, crown'd with Blisse of Fools, is bent To Wine, Feasts, Gauds, loose Merriment; Runs on in Lusts Career, till Grace stops-with Repent. I O headlesse, heady Age! O giddy Toyes! As humble Cots yield quiet Joyes; So prouder Palaces are Drums of restlesse Noise. II 'Twas in the blooming Verdure of the Yeer, When through the Twins Sol's Course did steer, That a spruce Gallant did, on Summons, strait appear. III Glitt'ring in Brav'ry, like the Knight o'th' Sun; Whose Nags in Hide-park Races run This Ev'n. 'Tis sure Volupto, old Avaros Son. IV Hot showes the Day, by th' Dust upon his Head, And all his Clothes so loosely spread, He's so untrust, as if it were not long to Bed: V His Hands keep Time to th' Tune of's Feet, his Pace Is danced Measures, and 'tis Grace Enough, ore's Shoulder to afford a quarter-face. VI Act, 'bove French Monkies, Antimasks he might Before the Apes (Spectators right) Such Dops, Shrugs, Puppet-playes shew best by Candle-light. VII How mimick hum'rous Garbs in various kinde Do checquer Whimsies in the Minde! As diff'ring Flow'rs on Peru's Wonder Gardners finde. VIII Hast thou black Patches too? for Shame, forbear; Smooth Chins should not have Spots, but Hair: But thou art modish, and canst vapour, drink, &amp; swear. IX How blazing Tapers waste Lifes blink away In Socket of their mouldring Clay! How powder'd Curls do sin-polluted Dust bewray! X As Prudence fram'd Art to be Natures Ape; So Pride forms Nature to Arts Shape: Corrupted Wine is worst that's prest from richest Grape. XI Wilt Reasons Sense dissolve in senselesse Wine? And sing, while Youths frail Gem does shine, Come, Laughter, stretch our Spleen; Come Sack in Crystal Shrine! XII First, Wine shall set, next shall a wanton Dame Our Blood on Fire, then quench our Flame. But Brute, Repentance shall, or Hell thy wild-fire tame. XIII Now, with the Gallon ere thou try'st a Fall, Think o'th' Hand-writing on the Wall: If Bacchus th' Inturn gets, down Conscience goes &amp; All. XIV Shouldst thou but once the swinish Drunkard view, Presented in a Myrrour true, Quite souc'd in Tavern Juice; in him, thy self thou'dst rue. XV A nobler Birth, with an ignoble Breast, Rich Corps without a Minde's a Beast: He's raz'd from Honours Stem, who, Riot, is thy Guest; XVI Thy Guests swoln Dropsies, and dull Surfets are: The Gluttons Teeth their Graves prepare; They're sick in Health, &amp; living dead, whose Maw's their Care. XVII Go, Corm'rants, go, with your luxurious Flock, Rap'd from three Elements; we mock Your muskie Jellie, Pheasant, candid Apricock. XVIII To Arabs, that they send their Phœnix write; In's spice Nest be cookt it might: Far fetch't, dear bought, best suits the Apician Appetite. XIX Go, with thy Stags embalm'd, entombd in Paste; On Tenants Sweat feeds rampant Waste: We prize 'bove wilde Intemp'rance, a Carthusian Fast. XX Excesse enhanceth Rates: Thou, on this Score, Grind'st 'twixt thy Teeth the starving Poor, Who beg dry Crums, which they with Tears would moysten ore. XXI Laz'rus, thy Skin's Deaths Sheet, 'twixt that &amp; Bone There's no Parenthesis! bemone, Dives, Christs Members now, or thou shalt ever grone. XXII Prance, pamper'd Stallions, to the Grave y'are driv'n: Nought satisfies the Soul but Heav'n, Th'art empty, World, from Morn, through Noon to doting Ev'n. XXIII In twice-dy'd Tyrian Purple thou dost nest, Restlesse, with heaving Fumes opprest, Which cause tumultuous Dreams, Foes to indulgent Rest. XXIV From hence the Spark, (what pitty 'tis!) is Ill Grown cropsick. Post for Physicks Skill; Phlebotomize he must, and take the Vomit Pill. XXV Doctor, the Cause of this Distemper state us. His Cachexie results from Flatus Hypocondrunkicus ex Crapulâ creatus. XXVI School him, whose Heav'n is Sense, whose Reason dim; Who wasts his Time, as Time wasts him: Give ore his Soul, Divine; Tayler make's Body trim. XXVII Now, sheath'd in rusling Silks, new Suits display; Thy Cloaths outworth Thee: Wisemen say, Hedg-creeping Glow-worms never mount to starrie Ray. XXVIII Yet, who's born under Jupiter shall move I'th Sphear of Honour, Riches, Love; Say Wizards. Under Jove w' are all born, none above. XXIX Still to be pounct, perfum'd, still queintly drest, Still to be guarded to a Feast By fawning Looks, &amp; squinting hearts—like an Arrest. XXX Still to have toting Waits unseel thine Eyes, In Bed, at Board, when sit, when rise: Such, Card'nal-like, their Paris prize 'bove Paradise. XXXI Know, Worldlings, that Prosperitie's a Gin, If wantoniz'd, breeds Storms within: To Torture turns the Metamorphosis of Sin. XXXII Pomp its own Burthen is, Whose slippery State Oft headlong, by too rash Debate, Tumbles for value of a Straw, pulls on its Fate. XXXIII His Heart-blood seeths; that Blood sends up in Heat Fierce Spirits; those, i'th' Eye, their Seat, Fires kindle; fiery Eyes, like Comets, Ruine threat. XXXIV Fierce Balaam, hold thy Hand, and smite no Asse But him i'th' Saddle; he alas Wounds through her Sides himself: Wrath through the Soul doth pass. XXXV Duels for Blood, like Molocks Idol, gape. Thou, turn'd a Swine out of an Ape, First put'st on Peacocks Pride, at last the Tygers Shape. XXXVI They'r gross, not Great, who serve wild Laws of Blood, Such, only Great, who dare be Good: Grace buoies up Honor, which, without It, sticks in mud. XXXVII Make thorough Search: As hard to finde thy Cure, As Circles puzling Quadrature, Or, next Way by North-Sea to sail to China sure. XXXVIII Lo, idle Sloth in Lap of Sodom plac't. Here lies He—did Occasions wast, Invaluable now, irreparable past. XXXIX Go, wanton with the Winde: misus'd Hours have A Life, no other then the Grave: Most, for Lifes circumstance, the Cause of living wave. XL The privie Councel of the glorious TRINE Did in creating Man combine; Angels lookt on, and wondred at the Soul divine! XLI Which, Storehouse of three living Natures is, Doth the vast World epitomize, Of whom, ev'n All we see's but a Periphrasis! XLII Now, to what End can we conceive Mans Frame, Save to the Glory of GODS Name, And his eternal Blisse, included in the Same. XLIII Fools, living die; Saints, dying live: Seeds thrive When earth't: Who dye to Sin survive; So, to come richer up, Pearl-fishers deeper dive. XLIV Now's Courtesan appears, who blowes Loves Fire, Her pratling Eyes speak vain Desire; To catch this art-fair flie the following Trouts aspire. XLV The gamesome Flie that round the Candle playes, Is scorcht to Death i'th courted Blaze: Thus is the Amourist destroy'd by lustful Gaze. XLVI This Dame of Pleasure, does, to seem more bright, Lattice her Day with bars of Night; Spots this fair Sorceress Cloud, more to enforce Delight. XLVII This Helen, who does Beautie counterfeit, And on her Face black Patches set (Like Tickets on the Door) shewes that She may be Let. XLVIII She'd Coach Affection on her Cheek: But why W'ud Cupids Horses climb so high Over her alpine Nose, t'orethrow it in her Eye? XLIX Truths Apes, beware; such Wheels your Earth do wear; Horses with rugged Hoofs will tear; VVho living's coacht with Pride, shal dying fall w?? Fear. L (But, noble Ladies, Virgins chast, as fair; Sweet modest Sex, that Virtuous are, Ye First, my Honour; my Respect, ye Second, share. LI Angelick Forms, far be it to perplex, Or cast Aspersion on your Sex: Loose Art in Those, your native beaming Lustre decks. LII So, have I seen the Limners Hand design A ruder Peece, neer one Divine, With this course face, to make That other Beauty shine.) LIII Her Eyes spread Nets, her Lips Baits, &amp; her Arms Enthralling Chains: Sense hugs the Charms Of Idlenesse and Pride, while Reason's free from Harms. LIV Tempestuous Whirlwindes revell in the Air Of her feig'nd Sighs; her Smile's a Snare, Which she as slighly sets, as subtly does prepare. LV Scarce is the Toy at Noon to th' Girdle drest; Nine Pedlars need each Morn be prest To lanch her forth: A ship as soon is rigg'd to th' West. LVI At length Shee's built up with accoutred Grace; The Spark's enflam'd with her set Face, Her glancing Eye, her lisping Lip, her mincing Pace. LVII On those, his optick Faculties do play, Like frisking Motes in sunny Day, Like gawdy nothings in the Trigon Glasse that ray. LVIII On her, profusely now he spends his Ore; Scarce the Triumvir lavisht more When he did costly treat his stately Memphian Whore. LIX Thou, inconsid'rate Flash, spend'st pretious Dayes In Dances, Banquets, Courtisms, Playes, To gain the Shade of Joy, which, soon as gaind, decayes. LX Which, barely tasted makes thee long the more; Enjoy'd, 'tis loath'd, was lov'd before: Thus, nor Mirths Flood, nor ebbe can please, nor Sea, nor Shore. LXI His Pulse beats Cupids March, and's itching Vein Must vent loose Lines, whence Souls are slain; Which, by augmenting Lust, will but augment his Pain. LXII Ah, might too forward Sin be checkt by Fear! But, what may cure that Eye, that Ear, Which, being blinde and deaf, brags best to see &amp; hear! LXIII Thy Juno's but a Cloud: She is not She Thy fond Esteem makes Her to be; Her Basilisks double Eye-sight kills with viewing Thee. LXIV She murthers Poysons, thence Complexion's found To murther Hearts. O, Joyes unsound From light-bred Daughters, though they weigh ten thousand pound! LXV Tell me not, simpring Lais, that thy Ray Can Bloud, turn'd Ice, unfreeze, like May; Whose spotted Face to Vertue does Soul spots betray. LXVI Cerusse, not Lilies there; thy blushing Rose Its Tincture to Vermilion owes: Curs'd be those civil Wars Loves Royalty oppose. LXVII Say not, a noble Love to thee he bears; While's Hand writes Odes, his Eye drops Tears; That tim'rously he's bold, burns, freezes, dares, and fears. LXVIII Nor tell me, Nymphadoro, that Loves Throes For her, robbe thy Repast, Repose: Thou peul'st not to repent, but to bebrine thy Woes: LXIX Woes, worse then Waitings at the five Mens trade; Worse than, when sick, through Sloughs to wade In Stormy Night, hard jolted on a dull tir'd Jade. LXX Shake off these Remoras would thee undo: The Virtuous loveli'est are. Grace woo; What Jeweller for Glass will orient Pearl forgo? LXXI The Soul, that Beauteousnesse of Grace exquires, And to decline By-paths Desires, Must inward bend the Rayes of his selected Fires. LXXII Unmuffle, ye dim Clouds, and disinherit From black usurping Mysts his Spirit; From Rocks, that split vain Hopes, to Heav'nly Comforts rear it. LXXIII B'entrencht ere midnight Larums; undergoe The Pennance of repentant Snow, Which, melting down, will quench, &amp; cleanse, as it doth flow. LXXIV Repentance Health is, giv'n in bitter Pill; Best Rectifier of the Will; The Joy of Angels, Love of God, the Hate of Ill. LXXV Action's the Life of Counsel; Bathe thy Soul, I'th' Lambs red Laver; in Dust roul, Before Despair; Hells Serjeant comes, drink Sorrows Boul. LXXVI Ere th' icie Mantle of a wrinkled Skin Candies the Bristles of thy Chin, Repent; ere chap-faln Door shall let Deaths Terrors in. LXXVII Never too late does true Repentance sue; Yet, late Repentance seldom's true: Who would not, when they might, may, when they would, It rue. LXXVIII For Minutes of impertinent Delight, Loose not, ô, loose not Infinite! Scorn to be Vassal to base Sin, and hellish Spite. LXXIX Why dost out-sin the Devil? He ne're soil'd With Lust, or Glutt'ny was; ne're foil'd With Drink, nere in the Net of Slothfulnesse entoyl'd. LXXX I may perswade, yet not prevail! Sin-charms Bewitch him, till Wrath cries to Arms: Sins first Face smiles, her second frowns, her third alarms. LXXXI Sinners are fondly blinde when they transgresse; All Woes are, than such Blindenesse, lesse: That Wretch most wretched is, who sleights his Wretchedness. LXXXII Presumption slayes her thousands! too late then Foe to advise of Danger, when Vengeance, that dogs their Steps, shal worry them in's Den. LXXXIII Gallants, Should Trophies Cæsarize your Power, Should Beauty Helenize your Flower, Should Mammon Danaize ye with his golden Shower; LXXXIV Yet, when Revenge shall inward Thunders send, And Sodom-Storms on Souls descend, Salvation scorn'd, what rests but every tort'ring Fiend! LXXXV That GOD refus'd, who you from Depth of nought To Being, nay Well-being brought! Ingrate, for Talents lent, return your selves Sin-fraught. LXXXVI Bad Great Ones are Great Bad Ones: Foul Defect It is, when Pow'r doth Shame protect; Such, will do what they will, but, what they ought, neglect. LXXXVII Virtue by Practise to her Pitch does soar; But they, who such a Course give ore, Shall sadly wish for Time, when Time shall be no more. LXXXVIII Ye, brittle Sheds of Clay, resolve ye must Into Originary Dust, When swift-heeld Death oretakes you. Where's then all your Trust? LXXXIX Men in their Generations live by turns; Their Light soon to its Socket burns; Then to converse with Spirits they go, &amp; None returns. XC Tomb-pendant Scutcheons, pompous Rags of State, Those gorgeous Bubbles but relate The thing that was, nere liv'd: 'Tis Goodness gildeth Fate. XCI Grace outlasts marble Vaults; That crowns Expense; Brasse is shortliv'd to Innocence: Times greedy Self shall one Day find its Præter-tense. XCII When Heav'ns that had their Deluge-dropsie, shall Their burning Feaver have; When All Is one Combustion; when Sol seems a black burnt Ball: XCIII When Nature's laid asleep in her own Urn; When, what was drown'd at first, shall burn; Then, Sinners into quenchless Flames, Sins Mulct, shall turn! XCIV Nere shall a cooling Julep Such appease, Whom Brimstone Torrents without Ease Enrage, i'th dungeon of dark flames, and burning Seas! XCV In Center of the terrible Abysse, Remotest from supernall Blisse, That horrid, hideous, gloomy, endlesse Dungeon is! XCVI Fools, who hath charm'd you? Sue betimes Divorse From your vain World, where power did force A Rape, there let not Choice make Marriage, which is worse. XCVII Man is a World, and more; For this huge Masse Shrunk, as a Scroul, away shall passe; Whil'st His pure Substance is as everlasting Glasse. XCVIII The World is like the Basilisks fell eyes; Whose first sight kills; first seen, it dies: Man, by a brave Disdain, its poys'ning Venom flies. XCIX Gay World, who Thee adores, thou great wilt make; Pearl may he quaff, and Pleasures take Of Sense, but must descend into the Sulph'ry Lake! C Is Hell the Upshot thou to thine canst lend? Crawl, groveling Trifles, to your End; Vanish beneath my Scorn. Goe, World, recant, amend. Provehimur Portu, Terramque relinquimus illam Quæ natum Gremio prima rigente tulit. O felix Oculus Portum visurus Amantis, Sit licet in Lacrymas naufragus ipse suas! Dedignor Indigna. THE SWEETNESSE OF RETIREMENT, OR The Happinesse of a Private Life. CANTO XII. The Segregation. THE ARGUMENT. True Blisse! Thou know'st but Few, to Few art known; While we shun Many, Thee alone We court, and All enjoy in Thee, when All are gon. I Waste not an other Word on Fools; Forsake What grates the Ear, pure Notions take; Know, that the smoothest Hones, the sharpest Razors make. II Ill suits it with a Russet Life, to write Court-Tissue: Swayns, by thresholds Sight, Observe, as well, as Lords by Clocks of Gold, Times flight. III Whose Crystal Shrines, like Oysters, gape each hour, Discov'ring Time by Figures Pow'r: That is the nobler Watch, foreshowes the threatning Shour. IV While comb'rous Gain does various Cares obtrude, The richer Minde courts Solitude, And does Guile (subtle to beguile it self) exclude. V More than high Greatnesse humble Goodness draws; Elm Rafters, mantled 'Ore with straws, Out-blesse Escuriall Tour's that seem Heav'ns Cupulas. VI Each City-Shop's a Trap; each Toy, a Yoke; What Wise-man willingly would choke Himself in thicker Clouds of griping Care, than Smoke? VII Who would not flie that Broil, whence Blisse is flown; Where, in Times dregs, Religion's grown From Best, to All (flow Tears of Blood!) from All, to none. VIII Lord, guide thy Church, which Interests empair; Who, without Knowledge, factious are, They little mind the Flock, so they the Fleece may share. IX Why climb'd they else the Pulpit, as Lots Brother, With Fire in one Hand, Knife i'th other? 'Twas vip'rous Nero slew his own indulgent Mother. X As Peace Heav'ns Blessing; so is War His Rod, Man-hunting Beast, a Scourge from GOD, Which doth unhinge the World; fierce Grapes in Wraths Press trod. XI Let me, in Griefs Prerogative, be bold To question Such, as dare to hold That they the Shepherd lov'd, when they forsook the Fold. XII Such Scramblers at the Shearing Feasts, I shun; Forgetting, and forgotten, run To fraudlesse Swains. I have a Friend compliant won; XIII By his Example may my Life be penn'd, May He read, like Himself, his Friend: Souls in Conjunction should, like Stars, kind Influence send. XIV Us Sympathie, the Mindes true Priest, does joyn; 'Tis Grace makes Sociall Love, divine; Tun'd Octaves Uni'sons are, Duos in One combine. XV When two enweav'd are in one high Desire, They feel like Angels, mutuall Fire; Flames Intellectiue liue, materiall Flames expire. XVI Vain World, thy Friends are Theeves of Time; Twice they Are robb'd; for, Times Self steals away, Leaving a dull December for a sportive May. XVII Fools Chat is built on Sand; But blest who hives Discourse, that on Heav'ns Sweetnesse lives, Such, as to raise the Fire to high-born Virtue strives. XVIII For Birds of Paradise the proper Fare Is purest Vapour of the Aire; Souls nourisht from the Influ'nce of Gods Spirit are. XIX Dew fattens Earth, the Earth yeelds Plants, and then The Plants feed Beasts, the Beasts feed Men; Man on His Word should feed, who gave him Origen. XX From Publike Roads, to private Joy's our Flight; To view Gods Love, we leave Mans sight; Rich in the Purchase of a Friend, who gilds Delight. XXI Thus go we, like the Heros of old Greece, In Quest of more than Golden Fleece, Retreating to sweet Shades, our shatter'd Thoughts we peece. XXII So, when the Sun, Commander of the Day, Muffles with Clouds his glorious Ray, He clearer afterwards doth his bright Face display. XXIII Kings, too much seen, grow mean. Renown does dawn From Cotts, unsightly hang'd, and drawn With Spider-woven Arras, and their Cobweb-Lawn. XXIV Victorious Charles the fift, who had acquir'd Fame, Wealth, and what could be desir'd By greatest Emperours, left All, to live retir'd. XXV That Sea-dividing Prince, whose Scepter'd Rod Wrought Freedom to the Church of God, Made in the Mount of Horeb fourty Dayes Abode. XXVI In Wildernesse the Baptist shin'd more clear, In Lifes Night Starrie Souls appear: They who Themselves eclips, are to Heav'ns Court more dear. XXVII But, now what need we cite Examples more, This by our SAVIOUR heretofore Was practiz'd, Who, whole Nights retir'd, did GOD implore. XXVIII Examples are best Precepts. Sweet Secesse, The Nurse to inbred Happinesse, How dost Thou Intellects with fuller Knowledge blesse! XXIX Waft us, All-guiding Povv'r, from wild Resort, By Cape of Hope, to Virtues Port, Where Conscience, that strong Champion, safely guards the Fort. XXX Here, Liberty, ev'n from Suspition free, Does terminate our Fears; by Thee We conquer Lusts: Each Sense wears Reasons Livery. XXXI With Thee, like cloyster'd Snails, is better State, Than to be Lions in a Grate: The World hers, coopt like Bajazet, does captivate. XXXII But, here (the Type of ever-smiling Joyes, Without disturbing Fears, or Noise) We bright-ey'd Faith, with quick-ey'd Art, in Truths Scale poize. XXXIII Religious Maries Leisure we above Encombred Marthas Cares approve; Uncloystred, we this Course beyond Courts Splendor love. XXXIV Seated in safe Repose (when circling Earth Suffers by Rage of War, and Dearth) Secure from Plagues and angry Seas, we manage Mirth. XXXV The low-built Fortune harbours Peace, when as Ambitious high-rooft Babels passe Through Storms; Content with Thankfulnesse each Blessing has. XXXVI So fragrant Vi'lets, blushing Strawberies Close shrouded lurk from lofty Eyes, The Emblem of sweet Blisse, which low and hidden lies. XXXVII No masked Fraud, no Tempest of black Woes, No flaunting Pride, no Rage of Foes, Bends hitherward, but soon is laid, or over-blows. XXXVIII We rule our conquer'd Selves; what need we more? To gadding Sense we shut the Door; Rich in our Mind alone. Who wants himself, is Poor. XXXIX Slaunder is stingless, Envie toothless here; The Russet is well lin'd we wear; Let Citts make Chains the Ensignes of their Pomp appear. XL Faith linkt with Truth, and Love with Quiet too, Ore pleasant Lawns securely goe; The golden Age, like Jordans Stream, does here reflow. XLI For Fields of Combate, Fields of Corn are here, For Trooping-Ranks, Tree-ranks appear; War steels the heart, but here we melt Heart, Eye, and Ear. XLII O, might a sacred Muse Earths Frenzie calm! On That we'd pour such suppling Balm, As might vain Trophies turn to an unfading Palm. XLIII Then should each He, who wears the Face of Man, Discern their Emptinesse, and span The Vulgars triviall Idols, and their Follies scan. XLIV Though in rough shels our Bodies kerneld are, Our Roof is neat, and sweet our Fare, Banisht are noysom Vapours to the pent-up Air. XLV No subtle Poyson in our Cup we fear, Goblets of Gold such Horrors bear; No Palace Furies haunt, ô rich Content! thy Chear. XLVI How Great are Those who use, like Gold, their Clay; And who like Clay, Gold, Great are they; To Grandeur, slighted Titles are the ready Way. XLVII Courts amplest Shine nor addes, nor takes from Mindes That pierce the World, true Merit bindes Bright Souls unto It, whil'st a Fog th'ignoble blindes. XLVIII Humble, not slav'd; without Discomfort sad; Tim'rous, without despair; and glad, Without wild Freaks we are. The World's or Fool, or Mad. XLIX From Taurus when Sols Influence descends, And Earth with verdant Robe befriends, And richer Showres, then fell on Danaes Lap, dispends; L When early Phosphor lights from Eastern Bed The gray-ey'd Morn, with Blushes red; When Opal-Colours prank the Orient Tulips Head: LI Then walk we forth, where twinkling Spangles shew, Entinseling like Stars the Dew, Where Buds, like Pearls, and where we Leaves, like Em'ralds, view: LII Birds by Grovets in feather'd Garments sing New Ditties to the non-ag'd Spring; O, how those tracelesse Minstrels chear up every Thing! LIII To hear quaint Nightingales, the Lutes o'th' Wood, And Turtle-Doves, by their Mates woo'd, And smelling Vio'let sweets, how do These chear the Blood! LIV While teeming Earth flow'rd Satten wears, embost VVith Trees, with Bushes shagg'd, with most Clear Riv'lets edg'd, by rocking Windes each gently tost; LV The branching Standarts of the chirping Grove, With rustling Boughs, and Streams that move In murm'ring Rage, seem Natures Consort, tun'd by Love. LVI VVee to their hoarse Laments lend listning Ears; And sympathize with them in Tears, Sadly remembring British Sions acted Fears! LVII Then, our sad Hearts are prickt, whence spring forth Cries; From those, drain'd through the bruis'd Soul, rise Faith-fumes, by Heav'ns Fire drawn, which drop through melting Eyes! LVIII 'Cause hungry Swords devour'd Mans Flesh, like Food, And thirsty Spears were drunk with Blood: Lord, how thy Spouse turns mummy'd Earth! her Gore a Floud! LIX Edge-hill with Bones lookt white, with Blood lookt red, Maz'd at the Number of the Dead: A Theam for Tears in unborn Eyes to be still shed! LX How many bound with Iron, who did scape The Steel! and Death commits a Rape On them in Jayls, who Her defy'd in warlike Shape! LXI Cross-biasnesse to Grace our Ruine spinn'd! Harrow'd with VVoes, be Heav'n our Friend! Sodome 'gainst Nature, We 'gainst Light of Truth have sinn'd! LXII This draws Eye-tribute from Compunctions Den; Grace, guard thy prostrate Suppliant then, VVho am the Chief of Sinners, and the Worst of Men! LXIII My Guilt before thy Mercy-Seat I lay, For His sake save me, who gave way To dye for Sinners! Ah, Sin kills Him every Day! LXIV Sin n'ere departs, till humbled in deep Fears, Embalm'd in Pray'rs, and drown'd in Tears, The fragrant Araby breathes no Perfume like Theirs. LXV More fruitfull Those, unwitnessed, appear; Gems are too cheap for every Tear: Deep Sorrow from It-Self doth its high Comfort rear. LXVI Salt Tears, the pious Converts sweetest Sport, To hopefull Joyes the entring Port, Ye waft blest Mariners to Sions glorious Court. LXVII But whether stray'st thou, Grief? Pearld Dew arraies As yet the Virgin-Meads, whose Gaies Unbarb'd, perk up to prank the curled Stream that plaies. LXVIII By rushy-fringed Banks with purling Rill, Meandring underneath the Hill: Thus, Stream-like, glides our Life to Deaths broad Ocean still. LXIX The pleasant Grove triumphs with blooming May, While Melancholy scuds away; The painted Quire on motly Banks sweet Notes display. LXX Earths flow'r-wov'n Damask doth us gently woo, On her embroyder'd Mantle to Repose, where various Gems, like Constellations, shew. LXXI Our selves here steal we from our selues, by Qualms Of Pleasure, rais'd from new-coyn'd Psalms, When Skies are blew, Earth green, and Meadows flow with Balms. LXXII We there, on grassie tufted Tapistries, In guiltlesse Shades, by full-hair'd Trees, Leaning unpillow'd Heads, view Natures Ants, &amp; Bees. LXXIII Justly admiring more those agile Ants, Than Castle-bearing Elephants; Where Industrie, epitomiz'd, no Vigour wants. LXXIV More than at Tusks of Bores we wonder at This Moths strange Teeth! Legs of this Gnat Passe large-limm'd Gryphons; Then on Bees we musing sat; LXXV How Colonies, Realms Hope, they breed; Proclaim Their King; how Nectar-Courts they frame; How they in waxen Cels record their Princes Fame: LXXVI How Kings amidst their Bands in Armour shine; And great Souls in small Breasts confine; How under strictest Laws they keep up Discipline; LXXVII How All agree, while their King lives, in one; But dead, the publike Faith's o'rethrown, Their State becomes a Spoil, which was so plenteous grown. LXXVIII Abstruser Depths! here Aristotles Eye (That Ipse of Philosophie, Natures Professor) purblinde was, to search so high. LXXIX Thinking, which Some deem Idlenesse, to me It seems Lifes Heav'n on Earth to be; By Observation GOD is seen in all wee see. LXXX Our Books are Heav'n above us, Aire and Sea Around, Earth under; Faith's our Stay, And Grace our Guide, the Word our Light, &amp; Christ our Way. LXXXI Friend, view that Rock, and think from Rocks green Wound How thirst-expelling Streams did bound: View Streams, and think how Jordan did become dry Ground. LXXXII View Seas, &amp; think how Waves, like Walls of Glass, Stood fixt, while Hebrew Troops did pass; But clos'd the Pharian Host in one confused Mass. LXXXIII These Flow'rs, we see to Day, like Beauty, brave, At Ev'n will be shut up, and have Next Week their Death, then buried soon in Stalks, their Grave. LXXXIV Beautie's a Flow'r, Fame Puff, high State a Gaze, Pleasure a Dance, and Gold a Blaze, Greatnesse a Load: These soon are lost in Times short Maze! LXXXV As solemn Statesmen sleight meer childish toyl, Framing Card-structures: Angels smile, And pitty so, when Life strait flits, Mans tearing Broyl. LXXXVI Search Empires Dawn, unwinde Times Ball again, Unreel through Ages its snarl'd Skain; Run back, like Sol on Ahaz Diall; See-All's vain. LXXXVII This did I from Theophila descry, (Not her fair-feather'd Speech could fly To Ground, but my Ears Pitfall caught it instantly; LXXXVIII Though her informing Voice be parted hence, Tides of impressive Notions thence Flow, soft as Shours on Balm, &amp; sweet as Frankincense.) LXXXIX The Conqueror who wades in Bloud for Pow'r, Cannot ensure th' ensuing Houre; Death soon may his Ovations sweetest Nectar sowre. XC All's vain. Th' Assyrian Lion, Persian Bear, Greek Leopard, Roman Eagle-where? Where is fam'd Troy, that did so proudly domineer? XCI Troy's gone, yet Simois stayes. O, Fortunes Play! That which was fixt is fled away, And only what was ever-flitting still does stay! XCII Vast Pyramids uprear'd t'interre the Dead, Themselves, like Men, are sepulchred; Ambitious Obelisks, Ostents of Pride, Dust wed. XCIII Heav'n sees the crumbling Fabrick of Earths Ball, That Dust is Mans Original; To Him All Nature is as wither'd Leaves that fall: XCIV Terrestrials transient are. Kings fight for Clods; Heav'ns Heire is mightier Prince by odds, Ev'n All is His, and He is Christs, &amp; Christ is Gods. XCV Thoughts, dwell on This. Let's be our own Deaths-Head. The glorious Martyr lives, though dead, Sweet Rose, in his own fadelesse Leaves enveloped: XCVI Heav'n was his Watch, whose starrie Circles winde All Ages up; the Hand that sign'd Those Figures, guides them; World, thy Clocks are false &amp; blinde. XCVII Time in Eternities immense Book is But as a short Parenthesis; Mans Life, a point; GODS Day is never-setting Bliss. XCVIII Could Man summe up all Times, so, as if there A Moment not remaning were; Yet all those close-throng'd Figures seem but Cyphers here. XCIX Could Calculators multiply times Glass To Myriads more of Yeers; alas, Those Sands, to This Duration, as a Minute passe. C Such mental Buds we from each Object take, And, for Christs Spouse, of Them we make Spiritual Wreaths, nor do we Her own Words forsake. CI Arise, ô, North, and thou, ô, South-winde, blow; Let Scent of Flow'rs, and Spices flow, That the Beloved may into his Garden goe. CII Whose Beauty Flow'rs, whose Height made lofty Trees, Whose Permanence made Time, &amp; These Pay Tribute by Returns to Him, as Springs to Seas. CIII This steals our Soul from her thick Loom, t' aspire To Canzons, tin'd with Enthean Fire; Taking high Wing to soar up to the Angel-Quire. CIV By such like Speculations would we stie To th' Sun of Righteousnesse! though I A Star am lesse than least of all the Galaxie. CV The Burden to each Hymn is This. Thy Wayes, Lord, are inscrutable! All Dayes, All Tongues, are few, are weak, to sound thy endless Praise! CVI O, that a Voice more audible, and high'r Than that shrill Trump, when All's on Fire, Might all Mens Hearts &amp; Tongues with thy Renown inspire! CVII Nature, blesse God, His Benefits be sung, While that an Ear can hear a Tongue; Commerce with Him is th' onely Trade, All else but Dung. CVIII But Dung—the wilde Inhabitant repeats From her inhospitable Seats: But, now 'tis Noon; prepare we for our costless Meats. CIX Lord of all grassie and all glassie Plains! Whose mighty Hand doth wield Fates Reins, Who dost embase the Hills, emboss the woody Veins. CX By Thee, the Pyrate, who by Nile being bred Has Land for Table, Pool for Bed, Camels, Arabias wandring Ships, by Thee are sed; CXI Thou with thy inexpressibly immense Finger of active Providence, The Worlds great Harbinger, dost All to Each dispence. CXII Strickt Temperance so cooks our Mess, that we With no Brain-clouds eclipsed be: The driest Cleernesse makes the brightest Ingenie. CXIII The Mount's our Table, Grass our Carpet, Well Our Cellar, Trees our Banquet, Cell Our Palace, Birds our Musick, and our Plate a Shell. CXIV Nature, payes all the Score. Next Fountain has Bath, Drink, and Glass; but our Souls Glasse Presents Religions Face. Our Meal's as short as Grace. CXV See, where the udderd Cattle finde us Food; As, those Sheep Cloth; these Hedg-rowes Wood. See, now a Present brought us from the Neighborhood: CXVI Ev'n th' Herb that Cramp and Toothach drives away, And bribes Ear-Minstrels not to play; And from archt Roofs to spungie Bellows Dews dos stay; CXVII That makes quick Spirits and agile Fancie rove, And genuine Warmth i'th' Brain do's move, 'Bove Furres or Fires; Whose Pipe's both Ventiduct, &amp; Stove; CXVIII That mounts Invention with its active Smoke; Draught of Promethean fir'd-Air took, Renerves slack Joynts, and ransacks each Phlegmattick Nook. CXIX That Lust cloyes which Expectance swells; but, here Are Dainties, that whet Taste and Ear; Where all are cheer'd with Joy, and over-joy'd with Cheer. CXX But, having traverst more of Ground to Day, Let us; for our Refreshment, stay, And with next rising Sun, compleat next closing Lay. Irati sævas Maris evitare Procellas Quæ potuit, felix est nimìs illa Ratis; Littoris optati Prospectu Navita gaudet; Gratulor emensam nec minùs ipse Viam. Animi Pabulum Contemplatio. THE PLEASVRE OF RETIREMENT. CANTO XIII. The Reinvitation.This verse appears under the frontispiece to Canto XIII.It is signed J.Collier THEOPHISA's fill'd w?? Sweetness, &amp; so Fair: Her Eyes so mild, her Breath perfumes the Aire: Shee's a refin'd, &amp; rare-composed Creature, Compleat in Mind, &amp; as exact in Feature: Ingenious Sweet, faire, &amp; proportion well, In Her do meet without a Parallell. THE ARGUMENT. Who Chance, Change, Hopes, and Fears can under bring; Who can obey, yet rule each Thing, And sleight Misfortune with a brave Disdain, He's King. I When lavish Phœbus pours out melted Gold; And Zephyrs breath does Spice unfold; And we the blew-ey'd Skie in Tissue-Vest behold. II Then, view the Mower, who with big-swoln Veins, Wieldeth the crooked Sythe, and strains To barb the flowrie Tresses of the verdant Plains. III Then view we Valleyes, by whose fringed Seams A Brook of liquid Silver streams, Whose Water Chrystal seems, Sand Gold, and Pebbles Gems; IV Where bright-scal'd gliding Fish on trembling Line We strike, when they our Hook entwine: Thence do we make a Visit to a Grave Divine. V With harmlesse Shepherds we sometimes do stay, Whose Plainnesse does outvie the Gay, While nibling Ewes do bleat, &amp; frisking Lambs do stray. VI With Them, we strive to recollect, and finde Disperst Flocks of our rambling Minde; Internal Vigils are to that due Work design'd. VII No puffing Hopes, no shrinking Fears Them fright; No begging Wants on Them do light; They wed Content, while Sloth feels Want, &amp; Brav'ry Spite. VIII While Swains the burth'ning Fleeces shear away, Oat-pipes to past'ral Sonnets Play, And all the merry Hamlet Bells chime Holy Day. IX In neighbring Meads, with Ermin Mantles proud, Our Eyes and Ears discern a Crowd Of wide-horn'd Oxen, trampling Grass with Lowings loud. X Next Close feeds many a strutting udder'd Cow; Hard by, tir'd Cattle draw the Plough, Whose galled Necks with Toil and Languishment do bow. XI Neer which, in restlesse Stalks, wav'd Grain promotes The skipping Grashoppers hoarse Notes; While round the aery Choristers distend their Throats. XII Dry Seas, with golden Surges, ebbe and flow; The ripening Ears smile as we go, With Boasts to crack the Barn, so numberless they show. XIII When Sol to Virgo Progresse takes, and Fields With his prolonged Lustre gilds; When Sirius chinks the Ground, the Swain his Hope then builds. XIV Soon as the Sultrie Month has mellow'd Corn, Gnats shake their Spears, and winde their Horn; The Hindes do sweat through both their Skins, &amp; Shopsters scorn. XV Their Orchards with ripe Fruit impregned be, Fruit that from Taste of Death is free, And such as gives Delight with choice Varietie. XVI Yet who in's thriving Minde improves his State, And Virtue Steward Makes, his Fate Transcends; He's rich at an inestimable Rate. XVII He shuns Prolixer Law-suits; nor does wait At Thoughtful Grandies prouder Gate; Nor 'larming Trumpets him, nor drowning Storms amate. XVIII From costly Bills of greedy Emp'ricks free, From Plea of Ambo-dexters Fee, From Vicar Any Thing, the worst of all the Three. XIX He in Himself, Himself to rule, retires; And can, or blow, or quench his Fires: All Blessings up are bound in bounding up Desires. XX His little World commands the Great: He there Rich Mem'ry has for Treasurer; The Tongue is Secretary to his Heart, and Ear. XXI While May-Dayes London Gallants take a Pride, Coacht through Hide Park, to eye, be ey'd, Which Dayes vain Cost might for the Poor a Yeer provide; XXII He may to Groves of Myrrhe in Triumph pace, Where Roots of Nature, Flow'rs of Grace, And Fruits of Glory bud. A Glimps of Heav'n the Place. XXIII This the Spring-Garden to spiritual Eyes, Which fragrant Scent of Gums out-vies; Three Kings had thence their triple mystick Sacrifice. XXIV O, happier Walks, where Christ, and none beside Is Journeies End, and Way, and Guide! Where from the humble Plains are greatest Heights descry'd. XXV Heav'nward his Gaze. Here does a Bower display His Bride-room, and Scripturia Her self is Bride; Each Morn presents his Marriage-Day. XXVI What Ecstasie's in this delicious Grove! Th' unwitnest Witnes of his Love! What Pow'r so strongly can as flam'd Affections move! XXVII The Larks, wing'd Travellers, that trail the Skie, Unsoyl'd with Lusts, aloft do fly, Warbling Scripturia, Scripturia on high. XXVIII (T' have been affected by a Virgin Heir, Rich, young, and chast, wise, good, and fair, Was once his first Delight, but Heav'n restrain'd that Care! XXIX Thou, Providence, dist both their Wills restrain; Thou mad'st their Losses turn to Gain; For Thou gav'st Heav'n to her, on him dost Blessings rain!) XXX But stop, pleas'd Thoughts; A high'r Love's here design'd; Fit in each Breast to be enshrin'd; Bright Angels do admit no Sex, nor do's the Minde. XXXI To all her Lovers thousand Joyes accrew; And Comforts, thicker than Mayes Dew, Shour down on their rapt Souls, as Infinite as new! XXXII Her Oracles directing Rules declare, Unerring Oracles, Truths Square; Her Soul-informing Light does Earth for Heav'n prepare. XXXIII All beatizing Sweets, as in their Hive, At her fair Presence do arrive, Which are to drooping Spirits best Restorative. XXXIV To whose Sight Eagles, paralell'd, are blinde; Had Argus thousand Eyes, he'd finde Darknesse, compar'd with her illuminating Minde. XXXV The Sun does glean his Splendor from her Eyes; Thence burn we' in Sweets, as Phœnix lies Glowing on Sols Ray-darted Pile of Spiceries. XXXVI From pretious Limbeck sacred Loves distill Such Sublimations, as do fill Mindes with amazed Raptures of their Chimick Skill. XXXVII That such Soul-Elevations still might stay, We'd bear and do, both vow and pay, And serve the Lord of Lords by her directive Way! XXXVIII Soon as our Ear drinks in His Command, Be't acted by our Heart, and Hand; Under his Banner we shall Satans Darts withstand. XXXIX May He accept the Musick of our Voice, While on his Goodnesse we rejoyce, And while each melting Psalm makes on His Grace its Choice. XL On Feast-Dayes from that Bour to Church we haste, Where Heav'n dissolves into Repast, When we Regalios of the mystick Banquet taste. XLI O, Deliccaies, infinitely pure! To Souls best Nutriment and Cure! Where Knowledge, Faith, and Love Beatitude ensure. XLII Poor Solomons Provision, poor to This, Manna, Heav'n-dewing Banquet, is: Who reigns in Heav'n becomes on Earth our Food and Bliss. XLIII O, Sacramental Cates, divinely drest! God the Feast-maker, Christ the Feast, The Holy Ghost Inviter, and the Soul the Guest! XLIV All Joyes await the blessed Convives, knit All Excellencies are in It, This overcomes our Spirits, overpowr's our Wit! XLV For us, poor Worms, that Glories Soveraign dy'd! O, let our fleshly Barks still ride At Anchor in calm Streams of His empierced Side! XLVI This is Heav'ns Antepast! By Union He's One to All, and All to One In Loves intrinsick Mystery to Souls alone! XLVII Ecstatick Raptures loose our Hearts on high With Joyes Ineffabilitie! Exub'rant Sweets orewhelm, as Torrents, Tongue &amp; Eye. XLVIII Such Life-infusing Comforts, from Above, Our Souls with inward Motions move, That totally for God we quit all Creature Love! XLIX Should He condemn us, yet would Love compell Him down with us, and we would dwell Rather than without Him in Heav'n, with Him in Hell. L Soul of my Soul! when I a Joy receive Disjoyn'd from Thee, let my Tongue cleave To's Palate! Me of All, not of this Feast bereave! LI Not in the winter Solstice of my Years, When shivering Snow surrounds deaf Ears, And dreary Languishment Deaths gashly Vizard wears; LII When they shall tremble that the House defend; The Columns which support it bend; The Grinders fail, the Watch through Casements Objects blend; LIII Then shine, dear Lord! when quivering Winters Dress Is icicled with hoary Tresse; VVhen all Streams frozen are, but Tears, through Loves Excess; LIV VVhen periwig'd with Snow's each bald-pate VVood, Bound in Ice-Chains each strugling Flood; VVhen North-Seas bridled are, pris'ning their scaly Brood. LV Then let those freezing How'rs be thaw'd by Pray'r! As VVells in VVinter warmer are By Circumsession of refrigerating Air. LVI That, nipt with Cold, or parcht with Heat, resign We may our Will in each to Thine, Be't lesse or more, be't low or high, be't Storm or Shine. LVII After Nights Soot smears Heav'n, Day gilds its Face; Wet April past, sweet May takes place; And Calm Air smiles, when rufling Winds have run their Race. LVIII Who hope for Mines, scorn Dross; Such only get Who lose a Game to win the Set: Wordlings, He's rich who's Good; Above's his Cabinet. LIX To well-tun'd Tempers Things that disagree Have oft some Likenesse; thus, we see Winde kindles Fire; Discord makes Concord Harmony. LX Affliction tunes the Breast to rise, or fall, Making the whole Man Musicall; We may Affliction Christians second Baptism call. LXI Who Christ for Spouse, his Cross for Joynture has; His Hand supports, where's Rod doth passe: The Lord of Angels, He the King of Suff'rings was. LXII Loves Life took Death, that Death Loves Life might gain! The Soveraign dy'd that Slaves might reign! The World can't Books that should be writ of Him contain. LXIII Those have the greatest Cross, who Cross nere bore; They'r rich in Want, who God adore; Who do's supply all Emptiness with His full Store. LXIV Saint Paul, the Gentiles Doctor, rich 'bove Kings, And high 'bove Oratories Wings, Rapt up to Heav'n, had Nothing, yet possest all Things. LXV The Rav'n of Birds proves Caterer, and feasts Elijah; so the Lion of Beasts Was Samsons Purveyor; Quails to murm'ring Jews were Guests. LXVI Midst Thorns environ'd, Love sweet Roses findes; Steep wayes lie plain t'inamor'd Mindes; Love gilds all Chains (surpriz'd not thrall'd) w?? Comfort binds. LXVII Then, threaten, World, a Goal shall bolt me in; He's free, as Air, who serves not Sin; VVho's gather'd in Himself, His self is his own Inne. LXVIII Then let fierce Goths their strongest Chains prepare; Grim Scythians me their Slave declare; My Soul being free, those Tyrants in the Face I'l stare. LXIX Man may confine the Bodie, but the Minde (Like Natures Miracles, the VVinde And Dreams) do's, though secur'd, a free enjoyment find. LXX Rayes drawn in to'a point more vig'rous beam; Joyes more to Saints, engoal'd, did stream; Linnets their Cage to be a Grove, Bars Boughs esteem. LXXI Burnisht to Glory from Afflictions Flame, From Prison to a Scepter came The lov'd and fear'd Eliza—Titles vail t' Her Name. LXXII She past the Furnace to be more refin'd; From Flames drew Purity of Minde, Not heat of Passion; hence, being try'd, She brighter shin'd. LXXIII Here wound, here lance me, Lord, thy Austin cries, Dissect me here for Paradise! The Cross the Altar be, so Love be Sacrifice! LXXIV Imprint thy Love so deep into my Heart, That neither Hunger, Thirst, nor Smart, Gain, Losse, nor Thraldom, Life nor Death Us ever part! LXXV Should Foes rip up my Breast with piercing Blade, My Soul would but have Passage made, Through which to Heav'n she might in Purple Riv'lets wade. LXXVI Forbid the Banes 'twixt Soul and Body joyn'd, The Corps but falls to be refin'd, And re-espous'd unto the Glorifi'd high Minde. LXXVII Who makes th' Almighty his Delight, He goes To Martyrdom, as to Repose; The Red Sea leads to Palestine, where all Joy flowes. LXXVIII Steel'd 'gainst Afflictions Anvel, let's become Proud of the Worlds severest Doom; No Majestie on Earth is like to Martyrdome. LXXIX Enter into thy Masters Joy's so great, This Thought is with such Flames repleat, That from th' High Court of Mercy Souls all Deaths defeat. LXXX Who saith, Fear not, Him must we fear alone; Blest, whom no Fear makes Faith be gone; How many must they fear, who fear not only One! LXXXI We are but once to our Graves Port brought in, To which from Birth w' have sailing bin, It matters not what Way, so we scape Rocks of Sin. LXXXII But, hark, 'tis late; the Whislers knock from Plough; The droyling Swineheards Drum beats now; Maids have their Cursies made to th' spungy-teated Cow. LXXXIII Larks roosted are, the folded Flocks are pent In hurdled Grates, the tir'd Ox sent In loose Trace home, now Hesper lights his Torch his Tent. LXXXIV See glimmering Light, the Pharos of our Cot; By Innocence protected, not By Guards, we thither tend, where Ev'n-song's not forgot LXXXV O, Pray'r! Thou Anchor through the Worldly Sea! Thou sov'raign Rhet'rick, 'bove the Plea Of Flesh! that feed'st the fainting Soul, thou art Heav'ns Key. LXXXVI Blest Season, when Dayes Eye is clos'd, to win Our Heart to clear th' Account, when Sin Has past the Audit, Ravishments of Soul begin. LXXXVII Who never wake to meditate, or weep, Shall sure be sentenc'd for their Sleep; Night to forepassed Day should still strict Centrie keep. LXXXVIII O let them perish midst their flaring Clay, Who value Treasures with a Day Devoutly spent! Faith's the true Gem, the World a Gay. LXXXIX So wastful, Us'rer, as thy self, there's None, Who loosest three true Gems for one That's counterfeit; Thy Rest, Fame, Soul for ever gone! XC When darkning Mists our Hemisphear invade, Of all the Air when one Blot's made, Mortals immantled in their silent gloomie shade, XCI Then for an Hour, (Elixir of Delight!) We, Heav'n beleag'ring, pray and write, When every Eye is lockt, but those that watch the Night. XCII Saints fight on bended Knees; their Weapons are Defensive Patience, Tears, and Pray'r; Their Valour most, when without Witness, Hell do's scare. XCIII May whiter Wishes, wing'd with Zeal, appear Lovely unto Thy purest Ear, Where nothing is accepted but what's chast, and clear! XCIV Lifes hectick Fits finde Cordials in Pray'rs Hive, Transcendently Restorative, Which might our Iron Age to its first Gold retrive. XCV See, listning Time runs back to fetch the Age Of Gold, when Pray'r does Heav'n engage; Devotion is Religions Life-blood; 'tis Gods Page, XCVI Who brings rich Bliss by Bills of sure Exchange; The Blessings that the Poor arrange For Alms receiv'd that Day, beatifies our Grange. XCVII Dance, Nabals, with large Sails on smiling Tides, Till the black Storm against you rides, Whose pitchie Rains interminable Vengeance guides! XCVIII But, Lord, let Charitie our Table spread; Let Unity adorn our Bed; And may soft Love be Pillow underneath our Head! XCIX Enricht, lets darn up Want; what Fortune can Or give, or take away from Man, We prize not much: Heav'n payes the good Samaritan. C Thus, Life, still blessing, and still blest, we spend; Thus entertain we Death, as Friend, To disapparel us for Glories endlesse End. CI Who, thus forgot, in Graces growes, as Years, Loves cherisht Pray'r, unwitnest Tears, Rescu'd from monstrous Men, no other Monster fears. CII They who their dwelling in Abdera had, Did think Democritus was mad; He knew twas so of them. The Application's sad. CIII Knew but the World what Comforts, tiding on, Flow to such Recollection, It would run mad with Envie, be with Rage undone. CIV O, Sequestration! Rich, to Worldlings Shame; A Life's our Object, not a Name: Herostratus did sail, like Witch, i'th' Air of Fame. CV Get long-breath'd Chronicles, ye need such Alms, Sue from Diurnal Breefs for Palms, Injurious Grandeur for its frantick Pride wants Balms. CVI In Aery Flatt'ries Rumour, not Fame lies; Inconstancie, Times Mistresse, cries It up, which soon by arguing Time, Truths Parent, dies. CVII Fames Plant takes Root from Vertue, grows thereby; Pure Souls, though Fortune-trod, stand high, When mundane shallow-searching Breath It self shall die. CVIII O, frail Applause of Flesh! swoln Bubbles passe. Turf-fire more Smoak than Splendor has; What Bulwark firm on Sand? What shell for Pearl may passe? CIX But Saints with an attentive Hope from High, On Heav'ns Paroll do live and die; Passing from Lifes short Night to Dayes Eternitie. CX Who blessedly so breathe, and leave their Breath, Of dying Life make living Death; Each Day, spent like the last, does act a Heav'n beneath. CXI Death's one long Sleep, and humane Life no more Than one short Watch an Hour before: World! after thy mad Tempest 'tis the landing Shore. CXII Mid point betwixt the Lives of Losse, and Gain; The Path to boundlesse Joy, or Pain; Saints Birth-day, Natures Dread: Grace doth this Bandog chain. CXIII When Moses from high Pisgahs Top descry'd Fair Canaan, Type o'th' Heav'nly Bride, He breath'd out his Joy-ravisht Soul, so sweetly dy'd. CXIV To Immortalitie the Grave's a Womb; We passe into a Glorious Room Thorough the gloomie Entry of a narrow Tomb. CXV Lord, as Thou mad'st (most pow'rful One in Three) The World of nothing; so, let me Make nothing of the World, but make my All in Thee! CXVI Pardon the By-steps that my Soul has trod, Most Great, Good, Glorious, Gratious God! Seal Thou the Bill of my Divorse to Earths dull clod! CXVII Thy boundlesse Sourse of Grace the scarlet Spot Scour'd white as Wool, that first did blot Th' Original in Man, that was so fairly wrot. CXVIII Check not my Hope, but spurre my Fear to Thee, Virtue to court, and Vice to flee! Love, lend thou me thy Spurre; Fear, thou my Bridle be. CXIX From hence, to run in Heav'nly Paths, I'l strive; My slender Pen to th' World I give; My only study shall be how to live, to live. CXX None Blest, but Those, who, when last Trump shall send It Summons, finde the Judge their Friend. The End doth crown the Work; great God crown thou my END. O, ter felicem, fortunatumque quieto Cui natat in Portu nescia Cymba Metûs! O DEUS! optato sistant mea Carbasa Cœlo! Omnis ab æthereis Spes sit habenda Plagis. —Est summus, Jesu, tua Gratia Quæstus.</field>
