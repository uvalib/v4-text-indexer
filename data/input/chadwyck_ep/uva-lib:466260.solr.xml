      <field name="fulltext">OVERTURE. 1872. I write of the Disciples, because He Who was their Master, having left on earth The memory of a face that none could paint, The echo of a voice that none could reach, Hath left his own immortal words and works To be a witness for him. Who should dare To add one line or lesson unto these? And in this year of loss, this first blank year For us whom he held near and dear to him, The heart is far too full to speak of thee, Except through speaking of thy faithful ones, Joseph Mazzini, Master, first of those The Sons of Men who are the Sons of God! O Book of mine, which he commanded! long Waited and worked for, and achieved too late! Whose first leaves flying over-seas, like flights Of white doves loosened sweeping straight to home. Were carried unto Pisa, and found there Mourning, and at the dead feet were laid low, Instead of in the master's living hand;‚Äî One day too late, and so came short for all, And missed the confirmation of his eyes; Missed for this world the comfort of his voice;‚Äî But have not therefore been unknown to him. I do but write as he inspired it me; There is no passage but he knew it first; I know there is no line but must have passed Some time or other through his brain to mine; Though not by utterance, by the finer threads, Which we, who live by vision more than speech, Are conscious of, but cannot frame again. For he was gone that day without farewell,‚Äî Suddenly parted from the martyrdom Of lifelong sorrow to immortal peace;‚Äî And in the momentary shock of loss, That made this world henceforth another world, Something we knew of what he first had felt, Who walked alone with God, and had no Higher Of humankind to be a help to him. The sweetness of his praise shall not be mine; Instead, the more pathetic sacred sense Of something wanting, and for ever here; Of something striven for, not without God's grace, And stamped with His denial; therefore ranked With other loss in life unmerited, Remembered ever with some faint far hope Of its repayment on another day. Now no man fears thee: so the slanderer's voice, More busy with the living than the dead, Is turned from thee; and men begin to praise, Seeing thy work was wrought without their aid; And eyes are lifted to behold the true Life-proven figure of the man who long Went in and out amongst them undiscerned. And though the generation is not born Yet, that shall look upon thee in the light, When the things prophesied have come to pass, Yet the world's heart is softening unto thee Whom the world hated, following with hate, And wrong, and falsehood, through a holy life. But I loved thee; I knew thee the first time My eyes fell on some words of thine by chance. I was a child then:‚Äîand when I am old, And my eyes fail from following in their flights The autumn birds into the far-off heavens, Still mid the youth of that day I shall stand Prouder than any in their pride of life, Having beheld what they shall never see, Having heard words that they can never hear, Having a face to make the darkness dawn, Ever within my memory for a friend; Remembering through the twilight of those days This solace of the sunrise, this delight, Bought by such pain as then shall nigh be past.‚Äî For grace he gave me that outweighs all pain, And light of heart I follow, dark or clear; Because I hold a prouder laurel-leaf Than any singer of imperial courts: For he, the Seer, the Master, and the Saint, Named me his poet, crowned me laureate Of his Republic:‚Äîtherefore are these words. I hold this charge for ever on my soul;‚Äî He loved me, he looked on me with such eyes As sent forth many a young heroic life To die rejoicing on a lonely quest; Saying to me, ‚ÄòDo not die, but live, and speak The words that God speaks to thee. Do not shrink For youth or for subjection:‚ÄîI endorse Thy speech beforehand, for I see thy soul. Hath not God written somewhat on thy face To fade and flicker, for a few to see? Write it out large in words that will not fade, And that can travel farther than thine eyes, And will not die when thou art laid in dust. I lay it on thee that thou keep not back That fire of life that burns thy brows so clear. What springs from a pure heart and a true mind, And a will bound to the Eternal Will, With eyes that look beyond the world to God, Is worth the hearing. Do not doubt, but speak.‚Äô For nine long years I held my peace, while God, By tender tokens irresistible, Laid silence on me; or by manifold Pressure of claims and voices from without; Or overmastering constancy of pain; (The cares and troubles of the outer courts, Not of the inner, where the angels sing Ever, through clouds, through winds, through fires, through calm). And once he chided me because the songs Were slow in coming:‚Äînow I think he knows (Or would know, were it not too small a thing) The truth he took in trust upon my word. For I made answer, ‚ÄòIf I must be dumb, If breath but lasts for labour, not for speech, It is not that I falter in my faith, It is not that I alter in my will, It is not that I fail from idleness: It is that God hath set such bounds for me, I cannot pass them;‚ÄîI can say no more. But grant me this assurance once for all‚Äî By that obedience which is life to me, Binding me one with higher law of life‚Äî That thou wilt trust me. I am true to thee. Dost thou believe it? And if, all the years, My lips are loosed not, and no word of mine Bear witness for me that my faith is firm, And still I follow in the speechless trance, Wilt thou believe it?‚Äô And he looked at me With searching eyes,‚Äîthen answered grave and clear, ‚ÄòI will believe it.‚Äô And we spake no more. And now I speak, not with the bird's free voice, Who wakens the first mornings of the year With low sweet pipings, dropped among the dew; Then stops and ceases, saying, ‚ÄòAll the spring And summer lies before me; I will sleep; And sing a little louder, while the green Builds up the scattered spaces of the boughs; And faster, while the grasses grow to flower Beneath my music; let the full song grow With the full year, till the heart too is filled.‚Äô But as the Swan (who has pass'd through the spring, And found it snow still in the white North land, And over perilous wilds of Northern seas, White wings above the white and wintry waves, Has won, through night and battle of the blasts, Breathless, alone, without one note or cry) Sinks into summer by a land at last; And knows his wings are broken, and the floods Will bear him with them whither God shall will;‚Äî And knows he has one hour between the tides;‚Äî And sees the salt and silent marshes spread Before him outward to the shining sea, Whereon was never any music heard.‚Äî I am not proud for anything of mine, Done, dreamed, or suffered, but for this alone: That the great orb of that great human soul Did once deflect and draw this orb of mine, (In the shadow of it, not the sunward side,) Until it touched and trembled on the line By which my orbit crossed the plane of his; And heard the music of that glorious sphere Resound a moment; and so passed again, Vibrating with it, out on its own way; Where, intertwined with others, it may yet Spin through its manifold mazes of ellipse, Amid the clangour of a myriad more, Revolving, and the dimness of the depths Remotest, through the shadows without shape, Arcs of aphelion, silences of snow: But henceforth doth no more go spiritless, But knows its own pole through the whirling ways, And hath beheld the Angel of the Sun, And yearns to it, and follows thereunto; And feels the conscious thrill that doth transmute Inertia to obedience, underneath The ordered sway of balanced counter-force, That speedeth all life onward through all space; And hears the key-note of all various worlds, Caught and combined in one vast harmony, And floated down the perfect Heavens of God. But when? but when? O, Master, thou didst say The time was coming. Is it come? Alas, It seems not so! The days are dark with storm;‚Äî The coming revolutions have no face Of peace and music, but of blood and fire; The strife of Races scarce consolidate, Succeeded by the far more bitter strife Of Classes‚Äîthat which eighteen hundred years Since Christ spake have not yet availed to close, But rather brought to issue only now, When first the Peoples international Know their own strength, and know the world is theirs, Which has been kept from them by force so long;‚Äî By force, not right; for no man spake them fair, To keep them patient through their helplessness; It was enough that they were chained and dumb. Will they be spoken fair to now? who knew No Saviour through the serfdom's centuries, Who will not know Him now their turn has come. Will not their day of reckoning be a day Of judgment, and of cursing all divine And human laws, to whom the world was made So hopeless and so cruel that all names Holy and dear are mockery unto them, The fatherless, who pay with violence The violence suffered, and in the recoil, Hating the world, hate God for its sake too? For Might instead of Right is hell on earth, Battle of darkness still against God's side. Whether it be soft-handed tyrannies Of those who at kings' tables daintily Feast in the bloom of eyes and bloom of wine; Or of the swarming millions from the mire, With masks of swine for images of God, More blind, more brutal, and more terrible; Yet not so blasphemous:‚Äîfor these will come, Having not known God, and denying Him; But those did know, and took His name in vain, And wrought the works of Cain by words of His. We of the royal lineage, of the line Unbroken of all kingdoms of the North, Up to the dim names of mythologies‚Äî If once the people whom our fathers spoiled, And drove as sheep, and shut their ears against, Should rise against us, and despoil us too, Seizing the fruits of their own ignorant hands (Which power and mind transmute to luxury); And take our children to be under them, And grind for them, until in face and form They too degenerate‚Äîshall we dare complain? Our limbs are beautiful through drudgeries Of theirs, which left them rest and space to grow Through generations to the perfect curves; Our hair has got the gold because the dust Of the world's highways never soiled the feet Of our forefathers; and the blue-veined hands Were moulded to their tenderness of touch By centuries of service rude and hard. It is God's judgment if He smite us so; Let us endure it, saying, He is just; But yet pray on as we were taught to pray, In an immortal hope,‚ÄîThy kingdom come! For when thou first didst find the Prophet's robe Thrust upon thee with utterance of lament, There was between the rulers of the earth What they in blasphemy did dare to call Holy Alliance: and the peoples slept. Thank God thy word has cleared the world of such As kings were in those days, not long ago! But thou didst reach the root of things even then With thy prophetic eyes, and God did set A witness for Himself in words of thine Which still the world may read;‚Äîbut no man stood Up in the place of power, and gave the hand To thee, and took the helm to the Untried. Is the world Christ's yet? Wherefore then wast thou Outlaw in every kingdom of the world, Except in England? England, thank thou God For that cold shelter that thou gavest him, For which he blessed thee, giving thee back love For the long years of scornful disregard! Was he not branded with all calumny Because he dared to teach the naked truth, Christ's words were not a book for Sabbath days, But law of life, and judgment of the land; Not to be chosen, and pieced, and dogmatised, But lived up to‚Äîthe whole and not a part, Alive not dead, one spirit in new forms;‚Äî And lived as Christ lived, poor, despised, alone, Apart with God, and working miracles, Not on the waves and winds, but on the wills Of men, upon the hearts of multitudes, The hidden germs of fresh humanities, Of live confederations yet unborn, The hidden founts of gathering river-floods, To bear one day the music of his name Through lands of harvest to the boundless sea. The rulers would not hear thee in their day: And now perchance the tide is on the turn, And the next flood will bring the fierce waves in‚Äî The long-pent surges of the deeper depths‚Äî To swallow up the landmarks of the Old. And thou wilt meet them, as thou heretofore Hast met the men who built the walls and towers To hold them safe against the shocks of doom‚Äî Thou, living yet in words that cannot die, Saying, ‚ÄòCome no farther; not upon this road, But on that other whither Christ has gone! Have for your watchword not the Rights of Man, But this more sacred, more invincible, Duties of Man, and Law of Life in God!‚Äô And will those deep eyes turn them in their wrath More than they did those others? We shall see. It may be so; for he held Hope with Faith, And set his hope upon the people's heart. I write of days that will not come again; Not in our time:‚Äîthe dream of Italy Is now a dream no longer; and the night Is over, with its beacons in the dark. Look you, who follow to the heritage Of a fair day, that you be worthy those Who conquered it for you against the world. Let God's idea grow in you, and the faith Of Italy burn holier:‚Äîbut no more Will blood be shed for it; that page is turned. Now mayst thou shine or fade; the star that shone Far on the lonely dreamer through the depths, (When all men mocked, and said, ‚ÄòIt is the light Of the marsh-phantoms luring wanderers on Who once have floundered out of the broad road‚Äô), Is now set clear in sight of all men's eyes, And ranked among the glittering Pleiades. Italia has to-day the name and place, And the fair body of freedom;‚Äîbut the soul? Of all he left behind, there is not one Found worthy even to follow him to a grave! O Star, be worthy of that starry soul That rose and set, that loved and worshipped thee! Italia! when thy name was but a name, When to desire thee was a vain desire, When to achieve thee was impossible, When to love thee was madness, when to live For thee was the extravagance of fools, When to die for thee was to fling away Life for a shadow,‚Äîin those darkest days Were some who never swerved, who lived and strove, And suffered for thee, and attained their end. And most of these have died that thou mayst live, And he is dead now who was First of them. And they are dead; and I half scorn myself That I sit here to sing the songs of them, Of which no word did echo in their ears When they were dying. Nay, it was to them Not words, but music;‚Äîmusic went with them Along the Sacred Way Capitoline; And inarticulate the trumpets rang About the dying ears of those that fell; And symphonies of some orchestral strain Floated, and fell, and joined its notes again, All day, all night, in one vibrating stream, Across the darkness of the prison walls; And sweeter than the sounds that from the harp Of him who vanquished sirens in their song, Thrilled out of Argo o'er Italian seas, Some far-off bells did echo through the lands Of exile, to the weary wayfarers, Pierced them with pain, and struck them with desire, And timed their bleeding steps upon the march With some great watchword still reverberate. Yet, even so, I could not speak the same, If it had cost me nothing, heart or health; For some may follow Truth from dawn to dark, As a child follows by his mother's hand, Knowing no fear, rejoicing all the way; And unto some her face is as a Star Set through an avenue of thorns and fires, And waving branches black without a leaf; And still It draws them, though the feet must bleed, Though garments must be rent, and eyes be scorched: And if the valley of the shadow of death Be passed, and to the level road they come, Still with their faces to the polar star, It is not with the same looks, the same limbs; But halt and maimed, and of infirmity. And for the rest of the way they have to go, It is not day but night, and oftentimes A night of clouds wherein the stars are lost. And such are some of those who speak, and live, And wait, and work, though blunted of desire, And know that their true life is hid with God. The way is smoother, not so glorious. These days are darker, for we yet may die In some great battle for the cause of God, (Call no man happy till he so has died); But not as these died, with the morning lights Upon their faces, standing rapture-pale Before the guns, or under sword and scourge Of those whom they had hated as we hate Untruth and malice and disdain of God;‚Äî But by the hand and under heel of those Whom we have loved against their hate for us, Trusted in spite of wrongs for heritage, And die at last by;‚Äîsome of us who may Have given up youth and hope of happy life While one remained to suffer for and save, And come without their calling, and stepped down Out of the guarded fold and pastures green, Into the ranks of those for sacrifice; And have not stirred thence, though the iron be hard, And flesh be faint, and death be slow to come All these long years, for whose sake grant us, God, Grace to endure yet faithful to the end. JACOPO RUFFINI. Genoa, 1833. We are betrayed and lost; and I am bound In the tower of Genoa, this hour that should sound The tocsin of our call, ‚ÄòAwake! arise, Young Italy! Thy time is come! The skies Shine towards the dawn!‚Äô Our dream was vain, was vain; Darkness hath settled on the land again; The shadow of the midnight gathereth Once more, and all is sleeping. It is death To speak the very name of Italy To this Italian people; therefore we Die. That is little: we have more to save:‚Äî To us, the young, the desolate, God gave, Through him whom first of all He did inspire, A charge to keep through blood, through death, through fire; Though flesh should faint, though hearts should break and bleed, To bear unhurt and whole the sacred seed, Young Italy, the unborn child of God, Through perilous ways of wilderness untrod, Until the day of her deliverance. So help me God, as I inviolate Have borne it still through good and evil chance. And yet another life, more fair, more great In issues, and in grace of God, than mine, O friend, who madest my life sweet with thine, I have in hold to save or to betray, Now in this last extremity at bay. I hold it still, the secret yet is mine:‚Äî How long? Each slow hour helps to undermine The ivory tower, the fortress of the brain. O Italy! thou canst not rise again If now thy firstlings fail thee! And I fail. Help me, O God, or now they will prevail! Because the deadly drops of atropine Are mixed into the water and the wine, So subtly that the treacherous poison draught Loosens the bonds of will, and being quaffed, Works through the nerve and brain, so that the sense To outward pressure grows the more intense, While the higher energy, the nobler pain, Is dulled and weakened, and the slackened strain Of human struggle leaves us but the prey Of passing ease, and instincts of the day. I have to die to-day, lest I should live To see my friend look on me, and forgive Me for betraying him. No, let me meet God's own face rather, at His judgment seat, And say: ‚ÄòWhen faith no more was left alive In all the world, I and my friend did strive Against the world for Thy faith's sake, O Lord, And raised Thy banner; and for this the sword Of kings strikes down among us, and the curse Of priests cleaves to us in our daily ways, And fate of exile falls on us, or worse Fate of the prison in the flower of days: Out of their judgment, Lord, I come to Thine‚Äî Out of their tyranny to Thine award. All joy, all hope of earth did we resign Long since to follow Thee; but now more hard Must be the sacrifice, mine for my friend, Denial of that one last trust in Thee, That we might both endure unto the end‚Äî Grant it to him e'en yet, if not to me!‚Äô Can I do nothing more for thee, my friend, Whom I have loved so? Can I only end By not betraying thee? Take what I give, And hold it sacred as a token sent Of our two spirits' deathless sacrament, This dying for thee when I could not live. I do not fear thy scorn, but I do fear Thy sorrow. O, my brother, take this cheer With thee upon the glorious way thou goest,‚Äî The dark and lonely way for thee who showest The lamp for those that follow;‚Äîbut for thee, What light but of the stars?‚ÄîThis doom for me Is not so bitter, rather sweetness grows, Thinking of thee, out of this early close; And peace is with me; and without regret My face unto the sunset skies is set. I could not give thee more, I cannot less, Than my whole life, even in fruitlessness. O Giuseppe, this shall be my flower, That I died first for thee! No other soul Shall come before me to that unlit goal, Or take pre-eminence of me of this hour! And this shall be my crown through all the days Hereafter, when men speak of thee thy due, And speak thy name, they will speak my name too, And say, ‚ÄòMazzini loved him;‚Äô nay, their praise Shall yet reach higher, saying all the truth, ‚ÄòBetter than all the world besides, in youth, Mazzini loved him.‚Äô That remembrance holds My name in lustre of thy name, and folds My spirit in a happy mist of sleep; And not for ever lonely I lie down; For me too in their hearts shall all men keep For thy sake,‚Äîso shall I have love for crown. I know not if God loveth me at all, For He hath sent no answer to my call When I have prayed, ‚ÄòLet me but see Thy face And suffer!‚Äô but I suffered without grace Of such revealing; and I prayed again, ‚ÄòLet me but keep pure, without sear or stain Of conscience!‚Äô and my prayer so far availed That not for lust of youth or life I failed. But having won so far, there comes an hour When a pure will avails not, and the power Is given to them who would not only kill The body shamefully, but bend the will By hellish arts to baseness, and would say, ‚ÄòDefiled for ever pass upon thy way, Soul that God could not save!‚Äô Thou dost not save Me, God, nor care to keep the heart I gave To Thee, and which is Thine for evermore; All doors are shut to Thee, except one door Of death, and if through that I flee to Thee, Thou knowest not from any fear of man, From any furnace of his cruelty, Where still Thy angels' holy wings might fan, I come,‚Äîbut from the clasping hands of sin, That on the vesture of the flesh have wrought Through poison, till the very blood is brought To be a traitor to the heart within. ‚ÄòIf thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out; And if thy hand offend thee, cut if off;‚Äô And if thy life offend thee, do not doubt That God requires that also. Loose and doff The spotted garment from thee‚Äîwhatsoe'er Come after:‚ÄîI have not quite known despair While I have life to give for sacrifice: Accept it, Lord; give me his life for price. This life we every one of us receive Out of Thy hands for trust, we may not leave Without Thy summons, nor should any plea Of force or danger be excuse to Thee. To violence, to torture, and to death, To smiling eyes and pressure of soft hands, Man's spirit still unconquered answereth, With faith for shield, while still his reason stands. And if for these I should forsake my post, Then spare me not Thy judgments uttermost. But this new, subtle stealing of the brain, What answer have I to it but to take Presumptuously Thy angel's sword, and make Mine own hand sin against myself: and when No choice is left but this dark choice to-day, ‚ÄòThine own self or thy brother thou must slay And sin against,‚Äô then I can only choose Myself to perish; and though never prayer Of mine before might pierce Thy heavens of steel, My love and my despair be my excuse With Thee, O God, to Whom I make appeal, Now that myself to Thee my cause I bear. Is it the poison working in my brain, That I as in a vision see things plain Before me? all the centuries afar, With thy face, Giuseppe, for their star, Grow radiant; and the life now bought with mine, Hereafter for the Light of Nations shine, For the world's wonder, for its tears and praise, For the world's Angel in its later days. And Italy, thy Mother, with the crown Glorious upon her, at thy feet bows down, And bathes them with her tears, the Queen that thou Knewest in vision, and that knows thee now; ‚ÄòO Loved too late, look on me reconciled! I am no more thy Mother, but thy Child.‚Äô And with the resurrection in her eyes, The Rome of the Republic shall arise As thou hast dreamed her, and stretch forth her hand As to a Bridegroom, and her stature stand Above the world for worship, and no more Shall darkness cover her true name, Amor. And Genoa, the place where I was born, Shall lift her head out of a dream at morn, And proudest of all cities wake and stir, Because another, too, was born in her. And all bright faces of heroic men Beholding thy face, not the young face then, Burn brighter in their gazing towards it, thus Signing in silence: ‚ÄòThou art first of us.‚Äô And queenly women, golden-haired and tall, Bend towards thee, and the brows imperial Of poets wait upon thee, and rejoice To listen for the echo of thy voice.... But then midst all the lovely hands and eyes Held forth to thine, and seeking thy replies, Amongst them, Giuseppe, keep a place Within thy heart, the holy, for my face; My face that now for thee grows white with death, And through the dark thy face remembereth. They will not love thee more than I do now, Though many follow where I went before. When all the world has changed to thee, and thou Art known of men, remember then that I In my first youth was first for thee to die, And love me, Giuseppe, evermore. O, Giuseppe, let now thy heart rise To its own sorrow's height! This sacrifice Make it thy own, my brother! Rise and bring The first fruits of thy soul, an offering Upon the altar of thine Italy. Do this first violence to thy heart for me, To live without me. Thou hast many a woe To suffer, and a longer way to go, And harder work than mine; but through thy life, Through all its anguish, all its storms of strife, Through bitter travail in the slow sore birth Of a new-linked Humanity on earth, Through exile and through prison; and the pain Of hope again defeated and again; Through the steep wilderness, up whose long heat Unsheltered, still will pass the bleeding feet Unswerving; through the visions crowned too late Of the unrecognised Apostolate; Through lonely days and nights, and evil fame; Through that dread fire awaiting thee‚Äîto see Thy best and dearest pass to death for thee, And with thy own hand, in the altar-flame To lay thy lambs, O shepherd, and to be Of thy beloved forsaken and betrayed At the pale pass of thy extremity;‚Äî Through all thy brethren's sins upon thee laid; And through that darkest and most awful hour When doubt of God springs on thee, to deflower The soul it cannot vanquish, and thy prayer Hangs on the verge of bottomless despair:‚Äî Then, when thou sinkest, mayst thou know at last An arm invisible about thee cast, Another voice in a serener air Unfaltering hold the pauses of thy prayer, And on thy fainting forehead like the breath Of rainy winds to prisoners parched to death, The sudden rapture of an angel's kiss; And thy faith be renewed to thee by this, Invincible, undying; and thy heart Will tell thee, Giuseppe, it is I; And not in vain shall I so soon depart, If God but grant me ministry so high‚Äî To be thy angel in the future years, And reach a hand to thee from other spheres. I will wait for thee‚ÄîI will fill the days Until thy coming with the love that stays Last of all earthly things by me, and takes My hand through these dark waterfloods, and makes Death lovely for thy sake‚Äîthe love that showed First the true stars of heaven to light the road, And make it straight unto eternity, With aim of all Progressive Life to Thee, O Father, O Divine, Whom, darkened so By priests and tyrannies, we could not know Until that pure hand woke us, with the stroke Of Thy great message, and the morning broke Upon the mouldering slumber of the world That had forgotten Thee, and the keen rays hurled Terror and clamour down the ways of hell, Where men lay lost and dreaming all was well; And the old Word again spake trumpet-clear, ‚ÄòLo, I am with you always, even here To the world's end;‚Äô until the creeds of Christ, That have been like their Master sacrificed, In simple splendour light the land of dawn, And the day cometh! But to me, withdrawn, By this hour's agony, from ways of men, It will not come on earth. Yet even then I while thou prayest will join prayer with thee To Him Who first to thee the vision sent, That He may hasten the accomplishment Of the prefigured Life of Italy. But if‚Äîit is so early‚Äîif the gleam Be starlight and not sunlight; if the dream Be for another cycle; if long years Of darkness, and of sorrow, and of tears, Must yet pass over her before the ways Of God be shown to her in later days;‚Äî Then for the love's sake we must ever bear Unto each other, I will urge my prayer The higher, my brother, for thy bitter need, That thou unstained mayst keep thy soul indeed, That for no bitterness of hope betrayed, For no impatience of the furnace made Sevenfold the hotter for the perfect proof Whereby thy spirit to its height is wrought, Thou shouldst let go thy faith, or stand aloof From witnessing to that eternal thought‚Äî God in all Life, and all Humanity Interpreter progressive of His Law:‚Äî That so once more that glory that we saw May clasp us both to immortality. Ah, Mother of mine, so beautiful! Thy son Should have been worthier of thee, and have done Somewhat to make thy name a star to men, And given thee back some perfect hour again. O first, O last, with whom I could not part! And shall not now, because I know thou art Not far off from the gates of Paradise:‚Äî I have known heaven through thee, not otherwise: For when, a child, first of the saints I heard, I understood of them from sense of thee, And each one had thy face and hands, and stirred My heart to worship through thy purity; But none so tender.‚ÄîThis at least is thine, Thy child hast thou kept all these painful years, Nursed in the patience of a love divine, Pure by thy kisses, faithful by thy tears. O sweet, O sorrowful, who didst not spare Thy loving life in ministry to such As have but paid thee with pain overmuch; Who lying in God's arms hast learned to bear The slow sad hours with smiles, and set thy face Still as an angel's to the bitter grace Of the sharp strokes wherewith He chasteneth His best-beloved;‚ÄîLove is strong as death; And no farewell we need to take, for thou And I shall not be parted long:‚Äîbut now, O Giuseppe, would that thou wert near! I am speaking to thee, and thou dost not hear! And out of heaven God sends no help to me. O friend, O friend! of this our agony Will any in the days hereafter say?‚Äî ‚ÄòHe passed alone the untrodden awful way; He understood not, but we understand‚Äî God hid His face, but held him by the hand.‚Äô UGO BASSI. 1849. Fra ugo bassi, Servant of our Lord, One of the Order of Saint Barnabas, The Sons of Consolation,‚Äîlate of Rome; Born in Bologna, and brought back of God There for His sake to die when all was done. Of how I came to know him, and the rest, I will relate in full before I die:‚Äî Who loved him, and will love him evermore. I. 1847. Among the mountains, on the farther side Of far Abruzzo, lies Cialdol√®, The highest hamlet upon all those hills. There was I born, and there lived all the years, (And all were happy), while I was a boy. I think the sun was always shining then, Upon the hillsides where I kept the goats, That were my father's;‚Äîbut when I was born He set apart a pair to be my own; And these increased, until a little flock Was ready for me, to be led away To the new home upon the mountain-ledge, Which I had now begun to build in hope; The spot where grew the sward most smooth and fine, A little lower than my father's house; While in another house sat my betrothed, And spun the flax, and when I looked on her, And said ‚ÄòNext year shall bring our wedding-day,‚Äô Lifted her great black eyes and smiled on me. But in a certain year fell many plagues Upon the country. First, the frost and snow On the high hills; and then, when summer came, The rain and blight;‚Äîfar down upon the plains The mulberries and the maize were smitten sore; And on the mountain slopes the vintage failed, And the flax withered; and in all the land All harvest came to nought; and to our ears The rumours came of famine, and at last The thing itself came towards us, creeping on Like a storm-shadow;‚Äîand the want was felt. For when our own land failed us, what had we, Who lived on our own land, and had no stores, Nor gold, nor markets? Also, then, the beasts Began to die and sicken; day by day The goats dropped down, and we beheld them die, And could not help them. Now our corn and wine, Our oil and milk, and all our stock, was gone, And nothing in our need was left to us To live on through the winter. Most of us Had not to live through it. With autumn broke A pestilence of fever loose on us: ‚ÄòThe famine-fever‚Äô the wan people said. Now had God smitten every living thing, Beast, and green herb, and man. Within a month Had half our hamlet perished; and of those Who still remained, the half were stricken down, And the rest went about like daylight ghosts, Waiting their turn. There was no man to help. Then spake our priest, who, like ourselves, was pool And ruined: ‚ÄòChildren, what are we to do? There is no help at all in all this land. The mountains and the valleys are stripped bare, Will God then let us perish utterly? Now will I take my staff in hand, and go Unto the Holy City, unto Rome, Unto the Holy Father, to beseech His succour: for if any aid can come, It is from thence.‚Äô And he took leave of us Dejectedly, saying, ‚ÄòGod and all the saints Have pity on you!‚Äô and departed so. But whether he reached Rome I cannot tell, Nor whether by the way he fell, for he Came no more back, nor did we ever hear Tidings of him; and still we died, and died. We had no hope; we only wondered now Who should die last, for then there would be none To bury him. I think the time had come For Christmas: and my father had been laid Beside my mother, and my sister too Was dead, and my betrothed; and I now lay The last of all the house, sick unto death. I was not sad to die, for there was now Nothing left in the world;‚Äîbut in a dream I suffered;‚Äîthere was none to come to me, And whether there was water by my side I know not;‚Äîbut I heard the fountain fall, Outside the doorway, from the little trough, Falling and ever falling, sweetest sound Of water,‚Äîand I thirsted more and more, Burning and craving;‚Äîfor methought a cup Of water stood beside me, and in thirst I raised myself, and stretched my hand and felt, And took the cup, and held it tremblingly Until it touched my lips;‚Äîand all at once I lay there helpless, and no cup at all;‚Äî I had not stirred‚Äîand yet again I tried, And reached the water, and it touched my lips Again, and yet again it was a dream; Again, again through all the long dark hours, Always the thirst, the striving, and no drop Once tasted. Was it hours, or days, or weeks? And once I came unto myself, and all Was agony, past thinking and past speech. But in my heart, in my extremity I prayed, ‚ÄòO holy Mother, pity me!‚Äô And pity did not come. And yet again Of my own saint, Antonio, I implored, ‚ÄòO Saint Antonio, help me!‚Äô And no help Came. And still, fainting, unto all the saints I cried, but no one heard me.‚ÄîAnd at last Sinking into the darkness,‚Äîone last cry, ‚ÄòO Jesus, save me!‚Äô and methought I died. But I woke up again, and it was light, And in the light a face was close to me, And lo! it was the face of Jesus Christ; Not as He hangs upon the crucifix, But as I saw Him once upon a wall In the priest's house, and now beheld again, Healing the sick, and working miracles, With a smile such as called the dead to life, And a face glad for its own mercy's sake: And straightway all my heart was in one peace. So my eyes closed again, at rest, but tired: And when once more they opened the same face Was still above them, and that face alone; And I confusedly did recollect That this was Heaven, and I was with our Lord, And, much abashed, I sought to kneel to Him, But could not; but I struggled to find breath And say, Lord, pardon me! at which a voice Sweet as the face, made answer unto me: ‚ÄòLie still, and be not troubled; I am come To be thy servant;‚Äô and it was so sweet, I heard and felt no more. But when again My eyes unclosed themselves, I saw the face Still bending over me; but now my sense Was clearer, and I could perceive that I Was in my own home, laid on my own bed Of goatskins, and the rafters overhead. And still the vision stayed before my sight, Nor did the comfort of it pass from me. And by degrees I came to know that he, Whose arms I felt around me, had the form And habit of a monk, and wore a cross Upon his breast. But I could neither speak, Nor understand; and so, for many days, I lay half-conscious betwixt life and death. But whensoever I was full aware, I knew that that same friend was at my side, Holding my spirit by his powerful eyes From sinking, and my body by his arms. And as the floods of fever ebbed away, The dream and the reality grew one; And I knew only one thing in the world, Sleeping or waking, present still to me; The face, the voice, the hand that tended me, And ministered unto me night and day. And by the time I was so far myself As to know right that he was neither saint Nor angel, but a mortal man like me, I had grown too to know that God had sent To save His lowest, him who was His highest, The flower and miracle of all mankind, The like of whom was not on all the earth. I was no longer anything but his, Heart, soul, and spirit, who had brought me back From death. And this was Ugo Bassi's self. And still I marvel how so great a grace Was sent to one unworthy, that even he In my extremity to me was brought. But in God's providence it came to pass That news of our distress had reached to Rome, Where he and others of Saint Barnabas Dwelt in Community, bound under rule, To succour of the sick and perishing. And twelve among the brotherhood were sent My master being one; and they arrived To our relief, at our extremest need, When none remained of us, except a few Dying and starving. Nor can I relate With what an overflowing power and love They wrought among us;‚Äîcomforting the sick, Until the dying hands were laid in theirs, Peacefully, or the first reviving smiles Of eyes awoke from death looked up to them. And those who died they buried full of hope; But few died after, for when they appeared, The fever stayed: and now the year had turned, And the new spring began to shine on earth. Also they wearied not, but strengthened still The hands of those surviving, taking charge Of all our scattered lives, replenishing Our stores, collecting on the waste hill-sides The remnants of our flocks, and sowing fresh Our empty fields. Moreover, by their words, Preaching and praying, they did so prevail Upon our hearts, that melted as we heard, That we through our affliction seemed more near To God, and somehow, following after them, Felt that a Father held us by the hand. And now that hope with the new year had come Back to Cialdol√®, and Easter Day Drew near, they got them ready to depart For Rome again. But I, when first I heard That they were going, felt my heart stand still, And all was cold within me like a stone. It did not seem that I could live and see Fra Ugo Bassi never any more: I had not suffered such sharp pain before, And now I wished that I had died as well. And as I sat, and wept, Fra Ugo came, And said to me, ‚ÄòWhy weepest thou?‚Äô and I Answered him, ‚ÄòSir, thou goest:‚Äô‚Äîand he took My hand in his, and looked into my face, And smiled as if no care had ever crossed The lovely lips, and leant, and spake to me, And said, ‚ÄòCome with me!‚Äô and I answered him, ‚ÄòYea, sir, to death,‚Äô and then my heart revived, And all the comfort wrapped me round again. And he said to me, ‚ÄòWherefore need we part? For verily I love thee; and thyself Hast need of me, and thou hast none besides. But wilt thou leave thy father's house, and all The old familiar country of thy youth, The freedom of the open hills, to dwell In a dark house, enclosed by city streets; To serve among the sick and miserable, In labour and subjection, day by day, Under a strict rule?‚Äô ‚ÄòSir,‚Äô I answered him, ‚ÄòIf I may sometimes see your face, I will; And I will bless you for your charity In taking me, whatever comes of it, So I but be with you;‚Äîand I will serve With all my strength, and will rejoice to serve. For truly, if you left me, I should feel That God had left me too.‚Äô And so he spake To the chief brother, that I should return To Rome with them, as a lay-servitor Within their hospital. So all of us Set off together, walking from the hills; And when we reached the valley underneath, We took our places in a bullock-wain, To carry us along the road to Rome. Slowly we journeyed all that day;‚Äîthe form Of the hill-side was ever in our sight, Though shifting as we moved. But as I gazed And gazed upon the lovely, changing hills, The distance grew between us, and I felt A yearning, sinking pain about my heart, As though I saw again my dearest ones Dying before my eyes. I had not guessed What this new pain would be. And suddenly The mountain-face whereon I had my home At a sharp winding of the road stood out All full and clear upon us, golden-blue Amid the sunset, calling, clasping me,‚Äî There was my mother!‚Äîand as suddenly Vanished for ever, as another turn Took us between the foldings of the hills. And in that moment I had said farewell For ever to my youth and liberty, And to the country of my youth.‚ÄîFarewell, Cialdol√®! the hill that nearest heaven Lies ever, under the blue sky, or cloud; Where the larks sing, and the wild goats rejoice, And locusts whirr in the hot summer day, And all life goeth joyously,‚Äîfarewell! For some whom I have loved and lost on earth, I shall yet find again, I think, in heaven, But never, in heaven or earth, Cialdol√®! And all that night I wept. But the next day All things were new, and the spring sunshine streamed On the luxuriant loveliness of earth. And as we went along our way, my heart Grew lighter, and I much rejoiced to be In such good company, and in the thought Of the great things I was about to see. The brethren too were glad upon the way, As for a respite from laborious days; And as we passed in shadow of the groves, Now ringing with ten thousand nightingales, Or over shadowless slopes of sheeted gold, Glittering with waters, fresh and blue in Lent, They held much pleasant converse, manifold; Things good to hear, but for my ignorance Too hard to understand; and none of them Spake with such blithe and such melodious voice As did Fra Ugo,‚Äîbut he spake the least, And mostly silent sat, with happy eyes Gazing upon the lovely lands of spring. And as we journeyed downwards from the hills Unto the valleys, coming to a place Where sloping sward lay smooth a long way on, We walked for pleasure, in the morning air, And sunshine of the morning all around; The wild bees humming, and the blue and brown And white moths flitting ever on before, And calls from unseen birds, and answering Calls, with a note of music, short and clear. And little yellow wayside flowers like stars Were all among the short hill-grasses, mixt With white cups in a tiny running stream That one might step across, that fleeted down, But faster and more lightly, as we went, With a sweet sound;‚Äîand all the ground beside Was mossy-soft and springing, and the turf Flew underfoot for miles along the way. And from me all the dark and winter time, And the old days, and the dead loves of youth Melted away in sunshine, and my heart Was born again as blithe as birds and bees; And I rejoiced and said, ‚ÄòO sir, the way I come with you is brighter and more glad Than any that I knew before! How clear The country lies before us;‚Äîand the spring Is over heaven and earth, and I can feel God loves us, and will guide us to the end.‚Äô He answered, with a face of happy peace, Fair as the sunshine, ‚ÄòYes, the hour is sweet, And the way pleasant;‚Äîlet us give God thanks For these good days, and all His gifts of joy, The lovely shadows of His Paradise, And let us keep their light within our hearts;‚Äî But think not all the way will be like this. If thou elect to cast thy lot with ours, Going where God shall send thee, day by day, Be ready sometimes for the rougher road. And we shall be wayfarers all our life, ‚ÄîOr I, at least, having purposed not to build A home on earth,‚Äîand none of us may know Whither our path may lead, except the end. For there are desert-places, fever-swamps, And paths where every step is on the verge Of death, where is no water and no moon, Where savage beasts go prowling through the night, Or men more savage, thirsting for their prey. God is our Father, even there as here, And sometimes closest in the wilderness. But every day as we passed farther on, More beautiful the way grew, through the woods Of chestnut, and the forests of live oak, Down to the plains, beside the wandering streams, Or through the heavy-scented shining maze Of flowering laurel; and I wished no more Than so to journey ever. And one day, About midday, we halted by a lake, A small lake in the hollow of the hills, Amidst the blue and yellow water-flags, Where many herons were wading. And we lay And rested in the shadow of the pines Upon the sandy shore; while overhead, In the clear blue, a long grey flight of cranes Went sailing to the West; and one looked up And said, ‚ÄòThey go towards Rome;‚Äô‚Äîand fearing not To give offence, I spake out of my joy Loud to Fra Ugo, ‚ÄòAnd we too, and I, Are going to Rome! Is it, indeed, no dream? I, plain Antonio Lotti? I shall see The Holy Father and the Cardinals, And kiss saints' bones, and see the jewelled dress Our Lady wears on feast-days, and find grace Of pilgrimage; they say that one may do More for one's soul by one day's walk in Rome Than by a hundred years of penances. 'Tis next to going to Heaven to go to Rome!‚Äô But Ugo did not answer me: for he Was gazing upwards, and his eyes were fixed Where now amidst the blazing, quivering light One golden eagle hovered all alone Above the lake. But when I ceased to speak, He spoke in a low voice, as to himself, Lost in a vision: ‚ÄòYea, to Rome, to Rome‚Äî The Great, the Holy City,‚Äô‚Äîand he sighed; And such a sadness and a musing fell Upon his face, that I spake not again. And as we went, I sometimes wondered much On what should be the manner of our life In Rome; and, with a ready cheerfulness, Fra Ugo answered me, and said: ‚ÄòOur lot Is blessed;‚Äîwithout cares or hindrances To serve our Lord even as He served us, And left this saying for us, ‚ÄúInasmuch As ye have done it to the least of these, My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.‚Äù Thus in His sick and sorrowful do we Behold and love our Master, Christ, and we Also behold and love His face in prayer. And such a sweetness is there, near to Him In this communion and this ministry, That all the pleasures of the world seem poor. And like Saint Francis, girded for the race, We have no other bride but Poverty; And though her face be somewhat grave, yet she Is fairer than all lust or pride of life To whomso hath her fast in the embrace; And he who once hath held her hand in his For Christ's sake, and His Church's, doth not think To loose it, for a king's inheritance. But of one thing do I forewarn thee now: That, entering on this service, thou must come Prepared to all obedience, to deny Thyself, and daily to take up thy cross, And willingly to give up thy own will To theirs, the brethren who rule over thee. For no hard rule is ours, and we obey Loving, not fearing; yet by straitened bonds Of our necessity, the hourly press Of work without us, we must needs require All harmony within, and waste no strength Upon disputings and perversity. Our battle is with this world's suffering, Not with its sin,‚Äîthat is the higher war, The office of the Prophet and the Judge;‚Äî We but console and heal; and we receive Among us none who make a life of peace Impossible, who need not fellowship And guidance merely, but severe restraint, And mind and manners ruled afresh;‚Äîfor such The world is wide enough,‚Äîbut in our walls Only the helpful and the humble stay.‚Äô I answered: ‚ÄòSir, if I may only stay, And this be exercise of helpfulness, That I should drag your burdens like a mule, Or grind your corn, like Samson in the dark, Or turn a bucket-windlass all day long,‚Äî I will be helpful:‚Äîand for humbleness, If you and all the holy brotherhood Be pleased to walk upon me for a mat, And when your meals are done give me the bones And scraps upon your trenchers for my share, And if I ask for wages give me blows,‚Äî I will be humble;‚Äîyes, and thankful too!‚Äô And Ugo laughed, and said, ‚ÄòYou shall be tried.‚Äô Through the fair weather, thus we journeyed on; All the land laughed with flowers, and sang with birds; My heart was light, and seemed a part of them; Yet seemed I ever in a holy place; Because Fra Ugo's face was in my sight Ever, and looking on it, it became My saint's face to me;‚Äîbut I spake not this, Knowing not how, and fearing to offend. Perhaps the fever in my head had left Strange fancies;‚Äîfor at night I dreamed that all The lands, and all their riches and delight, Were mine, and I was lord, and music pealed Around us feasting, and a dazzling shine, And roses crowding through the whole bright air; But still I shivered with some ache of heart, And sense of something wanting in the midst; And yearning to this unknown need,‚Äîbehold The face of Ugo Bassi! and I sprang With tears of joy to it, and clasped his hand. But all the face was changed and full of pain, And he was pale and bleeding, and the light Dwindled to moonbeams,‚Äîand I saw in it That heavy chains were on his hands and feet, And that he lay in prison and the dark. And fear came on me, and I said to him, ‚ÄòMy Master!‚Äô and I kissed his hands, and he Said, ‚ÄòGo thy ways; and God be with thee still. For I am taken from thee:‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòNay, Master, but let me stay here with thee.‚Äô And he smiled on me, saying, ‚ÄòWilt thou then Stay with me? Behold here is neither food, Nor light, nor any sleep. Canst thou then watch With me this hour?‚Äô And, weeping, I awoke; For with me stayed the pity of his face, So pallid was it, as with pangs of death; And the smile pierced me, for it was as one Smiles, who forgives his murderers; and I wept Till daybreak. And next morning, half-afraid I felt, to look upon Fra Ugo's face. But when I met him, he was still the same; The quiet happy face that lighted up As from a sunshine in the heart within, Rejoicing whomsoever looked on it, But far more whomsoever it looked on. And so my foolish visions proved in vain. And once, when we had journeyed all day through A country, where no houses and no trees Appeared, but only broken walls of stone, And ancient arches tufted with young green, We passed by rolling ridges, hill and dale, All like one flowering meadow long in grass, Where poppies grew, and every flower of field; And taller than the rest, the moonlight spires Of asphodel rose out of glossy tufts In straight white armies; and our wheels crushed out Sweet odours from the herbage as we went; And myriads of the great-eyed butterflies Hovered above the white and yellow blooms, And fluttered through the grasses silver-flowered, Filled with the noise of grasshoppers and flies. Now it was nearing sunset, and beside A little rivulet the oxen stood To drink, and rested. All around their heads The gathering cloud of the mosquitoes hummed, Golden amid the level light that streamed To left of us, and lighted up one side Of each black garment, and of each man's face. There was great silence, and we plainly heard The oxen chewing hard in the wet grass. I was aware that all one way were set The faces of the company, and all Gazed onward straight; and I too gazed that way. And in the farthest light the eye could reach, Low down on the horizon, I beheld Against an orange sky a purple cloud; A cloud that did not change, nor melt, nor move. And still there were faint shadows in the cloud, A mystery of towers, and walls, and hills, And the shadow of a great dome in the midst, All purple‚Äîand I knew that it was Rome. II. ‚Äò‚ÄúROMA‚ÄîAMOR,‚Äîthe mystic letters run, Spelled backwards by the Sibyl ages since, And written so in sight of all men's eyes, But never read till now; and even now The vision is but for the Prophet's eye, And to the world the riddle still remains;‚Äù So speaks our Greatest.‚Äô These were Ugo's words, But then, as now, I understood them not. I only knew of Rome, that I was there:‚Äî A great, strange city, lovelier in its lights Than all the golden greenness of the hills; And in its shadows, glorious far beyond The purple dropping skirts of thunder-cloud. A city of all colours, and fair shapes, And gleams of falling water, day and night; Resonant with bells, and voices musical; Lit up with rainbow fountains in the day, Lit up with rain of coloured stars by night; Where one might wander each day and be lost, And every day find some new wilderness; And full of some invisible, strange charm Of presence‚Äîwhat, I know not;‚Äîbut it seemed As if the air was breath of many souls Sighing together in a speechless hymn, In a long sadness, that was yet not pain. I never once could feel alone in Rome; The sense of some one greater than myself Was with me in all places, making life Solemn at all times. In Abruzzo were The sunsets full of golden peace; but here Splendours vermilion streamed across the West, As one vast cloud of angels and of saints. Now life woke in me with new consciousness, Awful and sweet; for heretofore had I Lived as the goats lived, and the summer streams, With gladness flowing from the morning sun, The happy Pagan life among the hills; And felt no more:‚Äîbut in me now was born A human soul and human fellowship, And with the sense of man, the need of God. A service and a purpose came to me In every day, and every day was linked On to another, onwards into days Beyond this life. Now, too, I prayed to God, Because without it life became too hard: But I forgot the old prayers I had made, Unthinking, to the Saints; and in my heart, An image then began to dwell of One Who among men was Man; yet perfectly Did manifest the Word of God; and left These words to us, ‚ÄòLo, I remain with you, Always, to the world's end:‚Äô and I began To feel Him with us, and to live and move As in His sight, and to be glad of it, Though ignorantly. But this sense I caught From Ugo, from my Master, for himself So shadowed forth in every look and act Our Lord, without Whose Name he seldom spoke, One could not live beside him, and forget. But, Ugo Bassi, I keep talking on Of him, and have not told his history; And truly, little of it do I know, For seldom spake he of himself, and none Among us spent much time in idle talk. This have I heard: his mother was a Greek, His father Felsinean; and they had No other son; and his baptismal name Was Joseph, like the great Italian Chiefs. But when he joined the Confraternity Of the Apostle Barnabas, he took The name of Ugo, as in memory Of a great poet surnamed Foscolo, Who had loved Italy, and for her sake Had suffered loss of all things, and of life, And had been buried in a foreign land. And Ugo was in many foreign tongues Learned above his brethren; and all arts Were easy to him, and in every one No scholar's, but a master's hand appeared. The Music of his Masses still is heard At Naples, and the songs that first he sang, Are sung in mournful memory to-day By many a convent-wall and fountain side; And pictures from his hand are guarded close In many a reverent chamber, shedding light And bloom of beauty through a gloomy place. And, beautiful in outward grace, a charm Dwelt on him, the beloved of all eyes. But all things he forsook, to give himself To ministry among the poor and sad; And now, still young, for many years his life Had been amongst them, wheresoever need Was bitterest, and the heart was pierced the most; And mighty gifts of healing, and great power For soul and body's aid and comforting Went with him in the toilsome way he trod. Wherever called him the most hopeless cry, Wherever want most sad, and pain most sore, Through the dark hours his steadfast watchings wore, The touches of his tenderness were spent; Till from the saved, the succoured, the consoled, One voice of blessing clung around his name. And early did his fame of eloquence In preaching spread abroad; for when he spoke He seemed inspired, and all who heard and saw Were drawn into a height beyond themselves. Hither and thither was he sent to preach, And minister meanwhile to the distrest, By his Superiors; and he wrought his tasks As he was bidden; but a living fire, Swift as the cloven tongues of Pentecost, Began to show itself, beyond the rules. But chiefly in the city of his youth, Bologna, did his heart unfold itself, Moving all hearts that heard in unison. And not without offence;‚Äîfor once in Lent, When fame of him began to get abroad, He was appointed preacher in the Church Of San Petronio, which was duly held A high distinction for so young a priest; And all the dignitaries of the Church Were there to hear the youthful orator, Besides a throng of people of all ranks. And in the midst, full in the altar lights, Sat the archbishop, splendid in his robes, Cardinal Oppizzoni, lending grace Of his most venerable countenance To the occasion. And the clear voice rose, And silence fell on all the multitudes, Till he and they alike were rapt away, Forgetting all things, save that God was near. But, speaking of repentance, and its works, Not its words only, he with his heart full Of what he had seen and heard and dwelt among At Rome, spake out, with bitter vehemence, Of the unchecked corruptions of the priests; Adjuring them in fierce, bold words, ‚ÄòBeware! Ye wolves that feed upon the flock of Christ, And call yourselves the shepherds!‚Äô and at this, The face of the Archbishop suddenly Changed as if palsy-stricken, and grew pale And grey, above the purple and the gold: And all the people gazed and saw him change And tremble, and a sudden shiver ran Across them, and they felt as if a bomb Had fallen, and some trouble were at hand. And the next day a council was convoked, The Cardinal-Legate, Ugo Spinola, Presiding, and a messenger was sent To Rome, to ask suspension and rebuke For the presumptuous preacher; and himself, Summoned before them, met them all arrayed In frowns against him, and in menaces. But Mauro Cappellari, who was styled Gregory the Sixteenth, at that time Pope, Aforetime at Bologna in the schools Had marked the rare gifts and the noble brow Of Giuseppe Bassi, and had said, ‚ÄòIf the Church win him, he will be to her An ornament;‚Äô and had disposed things so, That he was led to dedicate himself. And afterwards, when he had found the monks Not as he dreamed, and they had forced his mind To disillusion, he still fresh in youth, Still ardent, still of boundless faith in men, Would fain have parted from them, and returned Back to his home: but Cappellari then, Astute and sympathetic, wrought on him, As his confessor, and so comforted, Urged, and encouraged him, that he remained. And now, the Pope, knowing his inmost heart, And tender of the young remembered face, Befriended him; and would not pass on him Any hard sentence; only, bade them watch His words henceforward, and to send him back To Rome at Easter. And in May he sent For him to audience; and admonished him Mildly, and bade him be more circumspect. And Ugo, being young, took the reproof Submissively; and set himself awhile To silence and retirement, and no more Spake openly, but studied much alone. But the Archbishop was not satisfied; For the offence was serious, and he said, ‚ÄòHe is a young man, I an old;‚Äîbut wait! I bide my time‚Äîwe Cardinals live long. The end is not yet come.‚Äô But Ugo stayed At Rome: and, of his books the one he loved The most, and lived the most with, I have heard, Was this, in Greek, the Gospel of our Lord; And next he communed with the works of him Whom all the scholars think so great a man, Dante; and with some English poets too, Two famous men whose names I have forgot, But one wrote plays, and the other died in Greece. In stillness he abode; and as the dew Feeds the white lilies in a lonely wood, And the earth's strength is drawn into the corn, And in dark caves the sapphires crystallise, So were the spirits of the elements Of Nature, and of other noble minds, Into his spirit wrought in solitude By one diviner Spirit quickening all, Until the starry flower of his own soul Blossomed into its own clear shape and light; Not cut and stamped according to the lines Of his high priests:‚Äîand when he spake again, He did not please them better than before. And one Lent service, he officiating By order, at Palermo, in the Church Dell' Olivella, day by day the hearts Of all the city, drawn to penitence, Melted before him, listening to the voice, And gazing on the young angelic face, That pierced them with the message of the Lord, And then uplifted them, saying, ‚ÄòLook on Christ! Behold the Cross whereon your sins and mine Have bound Him! Listen to the lips that said, ‚ÄúForgive them!‚Äù Listen to them, saying still, ‚ÄúCome unto Me, and I will give you rest.‚Äù O broken hearts, O sorrowful and poor, Come unto Him Who came to bring you life! Hold fast by His good tidings of great joy, Have no more fear, for God is here with man, Yea, light and love,‚Äîthe Cross of Jesus Christ!‚Äô And the face grew transfigured in their sight, And the eyes grew like the glory that they saw, And something of the light and of the peace Passed from his soul into the souls of them. And all the people loved, and clung to him; And many sinful souls were brought to Christ, That April, in Palermo, by his word. But when the day came that he must depart, Multitudes followed with him to the shore, And kissed his hands, and wept to part with him. But he embarked in a slow-sailing ship, And came to Naples. And as he arrived, The rumour met him, blown by swifter wings, ‚ÄòThe new Black Pestilence, the Cholera, Is at Palermo, suddenly burst out, And the black flag is flying over her. And all have fled who can, but those who stay No more may pass the barriers, land or sea. They die by hundreds in the streets by day, They bury them by hundreds in the night.‚Äô And he was sad; but those who greeted him Said, ‚ÄòWe give thanks to God thou hast escaped: A little later would have been too late.‚Äô But still he mused and saddened; and at last He spake, ‚ÄòI must go back, and be with them! They love me, and I love them, and their need Is come‚ÄîI cannot rest away from them.‚Äô And all dissuaded him, but he: ‚ÄòMy vow And office gives me access unto them. Deny me not!‚Äô And the Archbishop said, ‚ÄòGo, if God calls thee:‚Äîyet I shall not see Thy face again, it fears me; easily May one go in, but hardly may return, But yet I may not keep thee, if thy will Be set to go.‚Äô So he took ship again Back to Palermo: and, with yearning eyes, Stood on the deck, and watched, as he drew near The glittering marble City of the South; And saw the palm-trees in her gardens stand, Approaching; and a breeze came from the land, And odours of pomegranate and of balm Came wafted, with the sound of funeral bells. And steadily they clave the water-lines, Opal and sapphire shifting on the floor Of glassy sea, that melted on a shore White with shell-pearl, and pink with coralline. And there he landed, past the harbour-bars Of quarantine; but all the quays were filled Already with pale people of the town, Who knew that he was coming, though no word Had been sent on to give them news of it. (Did no one ever need a face so much, They could but lie and wait, and send for it The strong magnetic call across the earth Of spirit unto spirit, knowing not Where they might find it, how it might be reached; Until one moment unawares the door Was opened, and that face was over them?) And all in passionate tears they broke, and kissed His garments, and embraced his hands and feet; And through the stricken city passed a thrill Electric, and the hearts of all revived. Some who were dying answered those who told, ‚ÄòIt is enough:‚Äîwe have lived to see once more The face of Ugo Bassi!‚Äô and some said, ‚ÄòWelcome the cholera, if it brings him back. Now know we God is with us in the fire; For He hath sent His messenger to walk The strait way with us;‚Äîas the souls that sang ‚ÄúGlory to God,‚Äù amid the whitening flame Along the highest wall of Purgatory, So let us suffer, and be purified, Rejoicing in this solemn fellowship.‚Äô But he on foot passed upwards from the port, Followed by many friends: and whosoe'er Had looked upon the glory of that day In Sicily beneath the summer sun, Would not have dreamed that Death was reigning there In shape so terrible;‚Äîfor all the road Was like an avenue of Paradise, Life, and full flame of loveliness of life. The red geraniums blazed in banks breast-high, And from the open doors in the white walls Scents of magnolia and of heliotrope Came to the street; filmy aurora-flowers Opened and died in the hour, and fell away In many-coloured showers upon the ground; Nebulous masses of the pale-blue stars Made light upon the darkness of the green, Through openings in the thickets overarched; Where roses, white and yellow and full-rose, Weighed down their branches, till the ground was swept By roses, and strewn with them, as the air Shook the thick clusters, and the Indian reeds Bowed to its passing with their feathery heads; And trumpet-blossoms pushed out great white horns From the green sheath, till all the green was hid By the white spread of giant-blowing wings. In the cool shadow heaps of tuberose Lay by the fountains in the market-place, Among the purple fruit. The jalousies Of the tall houses shut against the sun Were wreathed with trails of velvet-glossy bells; And here and there one had not been unclosed Yesterday, and the vivid shoots had run Over it in a night, and sealed it fast With tendril, and bright leaf, and drops of flower. And in and out the balconies thin stems Went twisting, and the chains of passion-flowers, Bud, blossom, and phantasmal orb of fruit Alternate, swung, and lengthened every hour. And fine-leaved greenery crept from bower to bower With thick white star-flakes scattered; and the bloom Of orient lilies, and the rainbow-blue Of iris shot up stately from the grass; And through the wavering shadows crimson sparks Poised upon brittle stalks, glanced up and down; And shining darkness of the cypress closed The deep withdrawing glades of evergreen, Lit up far off with oleander pyres. Out of the rocky dust of the wayside The lamps of the aloes burned themselves aloft, Immortal; and the prickly cactus-knots In the hot sunshine overleant the walls, The lizards darting in and out of them; But in the shadier side the maidenhair Sprung thick from every crevice. Passing these, He issued on to the Piazza, where The wonder of the world, the Fountain streams From height to height of marble, dashing down White waves for ever over whitest limbs, That shine in multitudes amid the spray And sound of silver waters without end, Rolling and rising and showering suddenly. There standing where the fig-trees made a shade Close in the angle, he beheld the streets Stretch fourways to the beautiful great gates; With all their burnished domes and carven stones In wavering coloured lines of light and shade. And downwards, from the greatest of the gates, Porta Felice, swept the orange-groves; And avenues of coral-trees led down In all their hanging splendours to the shore; And out beyond them, sleeping in the light, The islands, and the azure of the sea. And upwards, through a labyrinth of spires, And turrets, and steep alabaster walls, The city rose, and broke itself away Amidst the forests of the hills, and reached The heights of Monreale, crowned with all Its pinnacles and all its jewelled fronts Shining to seaward;‚Äîbut the tolling bells Out of the gilded minarets smote the ear:‚Äî Until at last, through miles of shadowy air, The blue and violet mountains shut the sky. All this he looked upon, and so the earth Smiled upon him farewell as it might be. And then he turned aside, and entered in The hospital of San Dominico. But it was a long time, and all the year Had changed, before he crossed the door again. God did not stay His hand for many days: Though lamps were lit at all the shrines, and prayers Were made unceasing, also many vows. And the fair statue of the virgin saint, That smiles in sleep, was carried through the town, Wreathed with her Roses; but it was in vain. And little was it any art could do Among the sick;‚Äîsome lived and others died; All suffered. And a blind and groundless mass Of terror, in this new and unforeseen And unappeasable calamity, Made it the heavier. Panic-stricken, most Remained because a strong arm barred them in: And selfish fear, nurtured of ignorance, Had hold of them alike within, without; And none whose hearts were not as strong as death Through love or courage or despair of life, But held aloof from contact with the sick. The hospitals were crowded down the floors With those who lived through agony, or died, Without a hand to help them in their need; And many a life flickered away for want Of aid sufficient;‚Äîwhile yet more poured in, Heaped one on other, till the doors were choked. And all one chaos of heart-rending pain, Helpless dismay, confusion, and despair: And many people died from fear alone. But Ugo entered in, and all was changed. Not only the unwearied foot and hand Skilled in all service, and the eyes that seemed To strike straight through in every part at once; But also the commanding ease of sway That stilled the tumult of the stricken throng, And carried calm and order through the ranks Of those that served, and was a stay to all. The strong sweet voice that made pain possible Without its sorrow, the illumined eyes That bent above the dying with the light Of victory, the unshrinking tender hand, Were as the soul of all the suffering days. And peace and patience came, and courage too, Living or dying; and the gates of heaven Were terrible, but glorious; for this side, Also, the angels stood, and held the posts. Long hours of darkness thrilled from eve to dawn, With one vibration of the voice that passed With four low words; the dying waited on Through heavy, fainting hours for one more look, One more of his, the last, and when it came, Found that the tide had turned within their veins. And kneeling on the floor (for other bed Was not, for some), he held within his arms One between life and death; who, falling off In languid stupor either sleep or death, Still lay there heavily, the powerless head On Ugo's breast, and neither stirred at all; And the light faded, and still Ugo knelt Cramped, motionless; and many hours went by; Until the sick man woke alive and saved; But Ugo sickened‚Äînor that time alone. For he, in course of that long troublous time, Three times was stricken by the cholera, Three times passed through an agony like death, And three times slowly battled back to life. And when at last the pestilence had ceased, He left Palermo; and came back again To his own country, and returned to all Obedience under an embittered rule. And in all places where one mother-tongue Made men Italians, fame of him was found, As of the greatest preacher of the time. And many noble cities sent for him To hold the office of the Forty Days In their cathedrals; and in those spring days The multitudes were gathered year by year To hear him: and the vast Basilicas (Lighted but by the thousands of the eyes Fixed on his face, and by the one pale face That rose above them fronting, paler yet From passion of the prayer than from the fast) Thrilled through their shadows as the low tones fell First on the ears that waited;‚Äîgathering power As soul enkindled soul, and silence grew Deeper to pain, beneath the ringing voice, That filled the air at last and overbore And overwhelmed in one resistless flow Of penitence, of pardon, and of peace; Till the strained silence broke with sound of sobs, Where hearts were breaking at the feet of Christ. And from the doors the people passed, but were No more the same;‚Äîan angel's hand had held Theirs, and the pulse had quickened under it To life-blood heat of holiness;‚Äîold feuds Of families were buried with the past; And orphan children at the stranger's hearth Found tenderness mixed with their daily bread; And usurers sought out the homes of those Stripped by their gains, and brought them back their own; And women took the mock-rose from their cheeks, And, wan with weeping, walked with purer eyes. And souls set free from sin, and hearts absolved, Clung with a grateful passion round the man Whose voice had made God manifest to them. And by the natural gifts that in him dwelt Unconsciously, and looked out from his eyes, And by the mighty deeds that he had wrought, Such chains were fashioned between them and him, Forged fast in such a glowing fire of faith, As all the world could neither break nor bend. The multitudes thronged round him, though he prayed For quiet, they heaped flowers before his feet, Until Bologna's streets were ankle-deep; (Ah, fond and foolish! yet another day, And you shall see him passing through your streets When all the flowers are faded). As he passed, The nobles threw their mantles in his path, And stood bareheaded; all the night was loud With songs, to do him honour; and when he Preached in the great church metropolitan, Saint Peter's, they had need to keep the gates With guards; and all the way along the nave, From the chief doors beside of which the rude Great lions of the red Verona stone Keep always at their posts, up to the arch That crowns the altar with its blazonry, (The last work of Caracci overhead, Where the Annunciating Angel bows Before the Virgin), stood a double line Of soldiers, forcing back the multitude To make a passage for him; for indeed, There was such pressure to catch sight of him, Or touch his hand, that there was danger feared, And felt. But all this had not come to pass, Without much envy, clamour, and alarm Among the priests. They did not dare to stem The flood of popular passion at full tide Now in Bologna; they took counsel long Together, they prepared their snares for him, And waited opportunity to fall Upon him; and they trembled as he spoke, For hatred: but they feared the people most, And of all people, most the Bolognese. But when he left Bologna, and retired For quiet to Perugia, they perceived Their time was come: and they let loose on him Their charges, of sedition, heresy, Presumption, and whatever else would serve; Besides some more, of pure malevolence Invented, to defame his spotless life: (Though Padre Venturini, Spisni too, The Father-General of the Barnabites, And all the heads of the Order stood by him And testified his blamelessness of all). But mostly they of the Dominicans, And of the Company of Jesus, were Against him; and it was resolved at Rome To crush the preaching and the preacher too, As privatelv as might be possible. Cardinal Lambruschini, Genoese, (Himself a friar of the Barnabites, And General of the Order formerly), Secretary, and known throughout the States For his severity and vigilance, And double-dealing, wrote in the meantime To the Superior of the monastery Situate at San Severino, thus: ‚ÄòMost Reverend and Well-Beloved in God: We hereby, in the Holy Father's name, Consign to your authority and charge, Subject to utmost rigour of your rule, A friar of the Barnabites, by name Ugo, and surnamed Bassi; him of whom Doubtless reports have reached you much of late. You understand the reason he is sent To you, and what a special confidence The Holy Father here vouchsafes to you. This man, although himself he is not given To disputation or to argument, And is himself contented with his Church, And works on men's hearts rather than their minds, Yet ever dwelling on the name of Christ, And putting those things last which should be first, He sows broadcast the seeds of heresy, Besides suspicion of a darker sort, Connection with the new political Secret societies; a charge, which I, Having investigated, do not hold True, but yet choose to act as if it were: Do you the same‚Äîthe man is dangerous. ‚ÄòIf God were pleased to call him quickly hence, It would be a great mercy to the Church; But that is where we cannot interfere. You cannot touch his heart; look to his mind. Though an enthusiast he is not a fool; But might be made so, for the finer brain Is the more delicate, and may be dealt More subtly with;‚Äîand there are many ways. Look that he come not out as he goes in. You have the means,‚Äîyou have full liberty To use them all,‚Äîand the result will count In your advancement. Do not seek at all To move his bent of spirit; take no heed Of anything he says or does or thinks, Except to mark where most the points will hit: Nor nurse a self-complacent stubbornness By a direct severity;‚Äîlet that Be used unsparingly and ceasing not, But never for the cause where it is due. Pass over that; and dwell continually Upon the charges that you know are false, And let them be the ground of everything. He is as innocent as is a child; If he were not, he could do little harm; And you can hurt him more by the very name Of evil which his soul abhors, than all Your penitential offices can do To the more hardened sinners sent to you For scandalous offences. Mix him up With these, and let them take their share with you In humbling him; give him for intercourse These gross companions, and reprove them all Together; take occasion to point out That he is worst of them; and add besides, That he to all his other sins has joined Hypocrisy, and used a saintly mien For cloak of vice,‚Äîwhile they, the lesser sort, Have but erred frankly; set them on to take The lesson up and carry out themselves; And let them mitigate their own deserts By such vexations as they can inflict, The coarser on the finer. It will be Easy to find a pretext in his face, (Which people say is like a pictured saint's), For taunts and bitter speeches, and such stings As strike the sharpest, being falsehood dipt In truth;‚Äîthis humble and pure-seeming priest Looks not,‚Äîas you will say,‚Äîthe thing he is, A brawler and blasphemer and the rest. And when you have him at the lowest point, Body and soul, starved out and beaten down, Then let him find a sympathising ear At hand, once only, in some lonely hour, And let him pour out all his heart to him, Finding a gentle listener, and a kind Half-helpful voice; and let him brood on this Unlooked-for secret solace, some pale days Tinged with an aching hope; and suddenly Confront him with the sympathising friend Turned enemy, and bringing all his words Against him, adding here and missing there Whatever may convert them to offence, And evil-hatching import undesigned. Bring him to see the one face he has found Tender, with long-laid malice mocking him In his betrayal; and when so his heart Sinks stricken from its last faint trust in man, And the broken spirit craves some resting-place, Some hour of respite from the torturing hands, Then take your time;‚Äîthen find in this the ground For fresh severities; and heap on him All that humiliation, pain, and want Can pour on one already broken down. And let him read his shame in every eye, And let suspicion follow every least Motion or act of his. You will not have Much trouble with him; his obedience lies Deeper than pride, or self, or any wrong; His meekness is a fault,‚Äîand yet his fault Is overboldness;‚Äîyou will know the man; One of those ardent minds who suffer pain, And call it pleasure, so it be but borne For one they love, and above all, for God: Who, if they can but fancy they are right, Are sure to beat you with a smile at last, Just when you have them safest under heel. Take from him all pretence of pride in this; Give him no choice; and always much insist Upon the mildness of his punishment, And gratefulness for the indulgence shown. ‚ÄòConfuse him every way; admonish him Wide of the mark; and never answer him According to his reasons; let him chafe Ever beneath a wrong; and still the more He tries to make a clear straightforward case, Twist it the more to some unlooked-for sense Of ill-intention; till himself begin To doubt himself and his own sense at all, And to regard his own high-flying views As mere conceits and fancies of the brain. ‚ÄòBut in whatever state he comes from you, (For he must not die with you,) I expect At least, that there shall be no more of that Exuberant fervour and self-confidence, Which holds the multitude enthralled by him; Nor of that vigorous courage in the blood, Which sees a doom, and marches up to it; Nor of that springing fountain in the heart Of inward sunshine, so that people say, (Profanely, people of the lower sort), They look on him, and straightway it appears As if a hundred candles at a saint's Shrine had been lighted up all suddenly, And in the midst of them the saint himself:‚Äî I trust to you to see he smiles no more. ‚ÄòHis Holiness, (who if he only could Be fallible, would err in this alone, Over-indulgence), has been much inclined To favour and forgiveness; but at last, Persuaded that his duty to the Church Demands a sterner treatment, after much Consideration, and advice from me, Sanctions whatever measures you may deem Advisable:‚Äîand many other things I leave to your discretion. I convey The blessing of His Holiness to you; With protestations of profound esteem From your most humble and devoted Friend And Servant, Lambruschini, Cardinal.‚Äô And the same time a missive came to him, Ugo, likewise, from Rome; and in this sense: ‚ÄòWhereas the Holy Father, with great grief, Has heard of grave disorders in the Church, Caused by thy preaching, and of scandals raisec Among the populace, in which thy name Is mixed; and that thou art accused thyself, By the Archbishop of thy diocese, Of rashness, violence, want of modesty, And private judgment of the Word of God, With licence to the verge of blasphemy; Besides suspicion, not disproved, of some Conduct disorderly in daily life;‚Äî Thou art hereby commanded and required To relegate thyself for penitence Into the house of the Dominicans, Within San Severino; and there wait The sentence of the Church upon the charge. And, furthermore, if there be any grace Of dutiful obedience left in thee, Or of fidelity unto thy vows, It is required of thee to prove the same By going freely and alone, without Appearance of compulsion; and to leave Such message as will soothe the minds of those Who call themselves thy friends, and flatter thee, Upholding thee in thy rebellious pride; And that thou break off converse with them all; ‚ÄîUnless it be thy purpose to inflame Still more the minds of men against thy Church, And all its lawful heads and ministers.‚Äô And on the hour he rose, and did depart Secretly, taking no farewell of those Who loved him, on the way that he was told. But in Perugia, when they found him gone, Great clamour rose; and, robbed of him, they went, Demanding him, and threatening, to the priests; But he sent back a note in his own hand To those he left behind him, which was read To reassure them, and the storm was quelled: ‚ÄòI go of my free will: let no man seek To follow, or to find me.‚Äô So he passed Into a desert place;‚Äîand truly there He found the devils waiting for his soul. Castello di San Severino stands Above Potenza, with the straggling town, Borgo San Severino, underneath. A desolate and solitary place; In the most bleak and mountainous recess Of Umbria, with the highest Apennines, Where the snow lies in summer, rising up Behind it; and an insalubrious air Making whoever long abides there gaunt And melancholy. Thither came one night The friar Ugo Bassi all alone; Footsore and faint and famished, from a long Day's journey over solitary hills; And pulled the rusty bell beside the gates, And asked for harbour in the name of Christ. His place was ready:‚ÄîLambruschini's word Was paramount in all the Roman States, And in San Severino. Ugo found His portion carved for him:‚Äîand he, resolved To endure all things for the love of God, To forgive all things for the love of man, Found his task hard, and harder, and at length Sank under it. Of what he suffered there No record now is left, but these few lines In his own writing; fragments, which a friend Gathered, and stored away when he was gone. ‚ÄòLet me receive this cross as at Thy Hand, O Lord, in meekness and humility! Lord, Thou dost know me innocent of what They bring against me;‚Äîthey lay to my charge Things that I know not;‚Äîyet this soul of mine, Sinful and sorrowful stands in Thy sight, O Holy One, and needs this bitter cup To purge it:‚Äîgive me grace to drink thereof, And patience still to glorify Thy Name, And thank Thee for Thy chastening, when Thy hand Is heavy on me, nor complain at all, Knowing that I have well deserved Thy wrath! O Saviour, Who didst give Thyself to die For us, who loved Thee not,‚ÄîWho didst forgive The cruel hearts that did not pity Thee,‚Äî Have mercy on me, help me to forgive! Let not the wrong prevailing conquer me, Nor hold my heart in bitterness of wrath. Let me forgive them; and forgive them Thou; And bring us soon together in Thy love! O Christ, the cross is heavy! Strengthen me, As Thou wast strengthened! Hold me by the hand For I am falling, I can bear no more. My heart is all on fire, and curses them: I cannot pardon! Everything is dark: There is no pity in the world for me. God, too, is cruel.‚ÄîIs there any God? There is a crowd of devils round my path, Mocking me, holding to me, filling me With voices of their hissing, night and day: O cast them from me! I have striven in vain; I have no more strength,‚Äîthey have hold of me. Christ, by Thy Cross I do adjure Thee now, Only to give me grace to cling to it! O lay me in the lowest at Thy feet, And with Thine own hands smite and do not spare, But only leave me not!‚ÄîThou art not here. There is no answer:‚ÄîI am all alone. O why am I forsaken of Thee thus? O Jesus Christ, if Thou wouldst only turn Thy face on me, I could endure it all! O God, O God, be pitiful to me! And to my enemies!‚Äô‚Äîand there the words Broke off:‚Äîbut he was changing visibly: The wan face sharpened into haggardness; The weak knees tottered to their daily tasks; And never once the sunken eyes were raised; And those that watched him said, relenting not, ‚ÄòA little longer, and he will be dead.‚Äô But the Archbishop of his native palce, Cardinal Oppizzoni, a mild man, Wrote: ‚ÄòThere will be great scandal if he dies Under our hands: we must get rid of him By more judicious methods: and meanwhile Let it suffice, to keep him safe away From Rome and from Bologna.‚Äô Thereupon It was agreed to banish him from thence, (With prohibition henceforth ever more To preach in the Legations or in Rome), And send him into the Archbishopric Of Naples: where he dwelt awhile in peace; Under protection of the Cardinal-Prince Caracciolo, who had loved him long. But when he died, a new Archbishop came To Naples, one already infamous, As Michael Savarese, and he joined This to his wrongs, that he drave Ugo forth. Who, finding not one safe place for his foot In Italy, nor one prevailing friend, Took refuge in Palermo; which indeed, The city he had done so much to save, Received him destitute, forlorn, and nigh To starving. For, set down within the port, Barefooted, and without the means to buy Another meal, he had not strength to reach The Convent of his Order, but sat down And waited in the market-place, until Some pious persons passing, he of them Requested:‚Äî‚ÄòGive me, in the Name of Christ, An alms, for bread to-day,‚Äô‚Äîwhich being given, He gathered up his strength, and passed along The well-remembered ways, until he came Up to the Convent. There he dwelt awhile, Ministering without pause, to body and soul Of all who needed; and beloved of all; Nor beloved only, but by natural power And majesty, invested with a charm That swayed men to his bidding and regard. But when the new Pope, Pius, was proclaimed, And amnesty was granted, and old bonds Were all relaxed, he went back unopposed To his own country, and revisited Bologna; and in many other towns Sojourned a little; but at last abode In Rome, a little while before our days Of trouble,‚Äîtrouble that turned good for me. And now, still youthful-seeming in his prime, Dwelt with the Brethren of his Order there; ‚ÄîTranquil at last;‚Äîa small Community, Most of them Romans;‚Äîbut Fra Ugo was No Roman, rather of the Lombard type; He being tall in stature and grey-eyed; Gold-threaded hair that rayed from lips and brow A face not pale, but fair and colourless, Perfect in feature, and that sometimes smiled Like the first burst of sunshine after rain. But O My Master, is it not all in vain! I write of a face that whoso once hath seen Remembereth, and whoso hath not seen Hath seen no other like it, and no words Of mine can show it him. And this it was That made the centre of my world at Rome;‚Äî A new world and a holy one to me. The brethren dwelt in an old spacious house Along a dark street in Trastevere, Near by the bridge of Saint Bartholomew; Few windows were there looking to the street, And the door opened on a vaulted way; But many corridors and windows looked To its enclosure on the other side, Where sunshine travelled o'er the walls all day In quiet; and one large acacia tree Grew in the courtyard, blossoming in showers. A small part only of the old house served The brethren's needs; but all the larger rooms, Lofty and bare, they made their hospital, In which by night and day they ministered Unto their sick;‚Äîand these were always full. And all of them had diligently learnt The art of healing, and among them were Some surgeons and physicians much expert. But mostly those, whom they received within, Were stricken by diseases, tedious more Than mortal, needing tenderness and care; Or else incurable, and needing but A refuge for the last sad days of life; Or else which poverty and care had bred, Needing the oil and wine of charity. And all, as brethren, they compassionately Waited upon, and tended. Also they Went out abroad to seek the sick who lay Helpless in their own homes; and visited Those who were bound in prison, or drew near To dying, whom they succoured, undeterred By any depth of pain or of despair. Also it was their duty to bring help Unto the widow and the fatherless, And counsel to the weak and ignorant, And consolation in the name of Christ To all afflicted persons whomsoe'er. A house of holy service and of peace Was this they dwelt in; living in one bond Of purity, and brotherhood of love; Speaking but little, praying, praising God With joyful service of the hearts and hands. All hardly worked and hardly fared alike: But unto me, the lowest in the house, Most dull and ignorant, there fell by right The lowest tasks; and I most truly found The life a hard one, strictly ruled and lined, And having little change or pleasantness. ‚ÄîTo fetch and carry, and to sweep and scour, To hew wood, and draw water,‚Äîbut in heaven! For now I grew to look on heaven itself As of a kingdom round about ourselves; And felt the very sadness and restraint Part of the higher and more heavenly life. I hungered, and I wearied, and I pined Often, and sometimes with vague weakness diooped, Which Ugo noted; and would often bring, At supper, his own portion to my side Of meat and wine, saying to me, ‚ÄòI am strong; But thou art weak, for still the fever leaves Some traces on thee, and our Roman air Is languid unto thee the mountain-born. Eat, and thou shalt be strong as well.‚Äô And I Could never disobey him, though the tears Came to my eyes. But in my saddest time I would not once have changed back to the life Of the old times, the free and child-like joy; So far more dear and sacred had the new Become to me. I sometimes felt a pang Shoot through me, as the summer still went on, And every day more sultry grew the air; When rising in the morning I passed forth Out of my narrow chamber, and I pushed Open the door, with wandering thoughts, and lo! My hand was, as it seemed, upon the door Of my own father's house, that opened out Right on the hill-side; and before me all The glittering slopes rolled down, wreathed here and there With the pale wood-smoke from the new-lit hearths; And all the air full of the silver threads Of gossamer, hung thickly on the wet Wild, myrtle bushes; and the golden wall Of broom against the rock-face, stirred at times With twitter of the little mountain-birds; And overhead, gathered against the sky, My goats were standing, waiting at the edge Until my first call sounded; leaping then From rock to rock so lightly, that they shook Only the cistus blossom down;‚Äîthe dawn Of yet another long unclouded day. When swiftly in the opening of a door, All things were changed, and all was dark and bare In the long gloomy corridor, where through The open doors the sick and suffering lay;‚Äî And in my ears the call to matin prayers Before the heavy and monotonous toil Of the long day. And yet I did but feel, ‚ÄòIt is good for me to be here.‚Äô And had There been no other cause, I could not now Have borne to leave my master, as I loved To call Fra Ugo, but rebuking me He said, ‚ÄòI am thy Fellow-servant; call Me Brother, in one Father and one Lord.‚Äô Yet in my heart he was the master still; Nor in mine only, but in every heart Of those that knew him;‚Äîthough he naught assumed. But was the youngest of the brotherhood, And had no rule among them, but obeyed, And took his turn of office with the rest, In hall, or chapel, or in hospital, With glad and humble manners, like a child. And yet, whenever one was dying, he Prayed for Fra Ugo; and in any house Where there was mourning, the bereaved implored, In their first anguish, to Fra Ugo, Come; And if within the hospital should one Go under pain of knife or cautery, He begged the hand of Ugo;‚Äîand at night When any moaned and tossed, and could not sleep, And it was said to him, ‚ÄòWhom seekest thou?‚Äô The answer was, ‚ÄòFra Ugo.‚Äô As he passed, Involuntary gladness broke around; As when birds sing because they feel the sun Is rising; such grace had he in all eyes. And ever with the same unwearied peace From one to another down the weary walls, He moved, unconscious seeming of himself; Beholding but the sad sick faces turned To him for succour; or that other face To which he turned himself, (that you might see Was shining on him, full and clear to him, When the rapt eyes grew glorious in their gaze) That comforted and helped him, and upheld Him happy, though the tears were in his eyes For pity. I remember in those days, Luigi Ambrosoni, an old man, Half-paralytic, who for many years Had lain in a dull corner, just between The window and the wall, and never more Would move from it:‚Äîhe said to me, ‚ÄòWe both Have a good place. God has been good to us Sending Fra Ugo here. Before he came, I often wearied much, and longed to go; But now I am glad that I have lived so long: And am content to lie here for as long As God sees fit, if He will only send Fra Ugo's voice to greet me once a day!‚Äô And all the brethren loved him well, as one Beyond themselves, a glory to their house; And all the troubles of the days gone by Were as they had not been; and quietly The heavenly life flowed on a little while. God granted him this boon for love of him, To dwell at peace among unenvious souls, Who were content to love him, and to let His light shine forth, nor vex him with themselves And their low humours; but beside him each Himself seemed lifted to a sweeter calm. And one day I remember as I passed, The Prior, an old man, and much beloved, Said to him: ‚ÄòWe all serve our Lord, my Son, As the first Deacons; but amongst us all, Art thou, for our Saint Stephen, full of faith And power, our youngest and our best-beloved, But yet of higher honour than the rest.‚Äô And Ugo flushed a little, and replied: ‚ÄòMy father, you but love me over-well; Where are the stones? For truly, through your love, And through my brethren's, life is soft to me; And I go forth to meet no harder shower Than of the almond-blossoms overhead.‚Äô But earnestly the aged father gazed On him, and evenso, his face grew grave, Murmuring, ‚ÄòThe end is not yet come, my son,‚Äî Is not yet come.‚Äô And Ugo went his way; But when I met him in the corridor, A minute later, walking swift and straight, I started at him,‚Äîfor it was as though A sunset streamed upon his face, and all His hair were backwards blown and golden, by A wind from the sea; and he beheld me not; With set eyes gazing out, as though he saw A vision of the Holy Sepulchre, Most beautiful, most awful. III. 1848. Now I heard Fra Ugo Bassi preach. For though in Rome He held no public ministry this year, On Sundays in the hospital he took His turn in preaching, at the service held Where five long chambers, lined with suffering folk, Converged, and in the midst an altar stood, By which on feast-days stood the priest, and spoke. And I remember how, one day in March, When all the air was thrilling with the spring, And even the sick people in their beds Felt, though they could not see it, he stood there; Looking down all the lines of weary life, Still for a little under the sweet voice, And spoke this sermon to them, tenderly, As it was written down by one who heard: ‚Äò‚ÄúI am the True Vine,‚Äù said our Lord, ‚Äúand Ye, ‚ÄúMy Brethren, are the Branches;‚Äù and that Vine, Then first uplifted in its place, and hung With its first purple grapes, since then has grown, Until its green leaves gladden half the world, And from its countless clusters rivers flow For healing of the nations, and its boughs Innumerable stretch through all the earth, Ever increasing, ever each entwined With each, all living from the Central Heart. And you and I, my brethren, live and grow, Branches of that immortal human Stem. Let us consider now this life of the Vine, Whereof we are partakers: we shall see Its way is not of pleasure nor of ease. It groweth not like the wild trailing weeds Whither it willeth, flowering here and there; Or lifting up proud blossoms to the sun, Kissed by the butterflies, and glad for life, And glorious in their beautiful array; Or running into lovely labyrinths Of many forms and many fantasies, Rejoicing in its own luxuriant life. The Flower of the Vine is but a little thing, The least part of its life;‚Äîyou scarce could tell It ever had a flower; the fruit begins Almost before the flower has had its day. And as it grows, it is not free to heaven, But tied to a stake; and if its arms stretch out, It is but crosswise, also forced and bound; And so it draws out of the hard hill-side, Fixed in its own place, its own food of life; And quickens with it, breaking forth in bud, Joyous and green, and exquisite of form, Wreathed lightly into tendril, leaf, and bloom. Yea, the grace of the green vine makes all the land Lovely in spring-time; and it still grows on Faster, in lavishness of its own life; Till the fair shoots begin to wind and wave In the blue air, and feel how sweet it is. But so they leave it not; the husbandman Comes early, with the pruning-hooks and shears, And strips it bare of all its innocent pride, And wandering garlands, and cuts deep and sure, Unsparing for its tenderness and joy. And in its loss and pain it wasteth not; But yields itself with unabated life, More perfect under the despoiling hand. The bleeding limbs are hardened into wood; The thinned-out bunches ripen into fruit More full and precious, to the purple prime. And still, the more it grows, the straitlier bound Are all its branches; and as rounds the fruit, And the heart's crimson comes to show in it, And it advances to its hour,‚Äîits leaves Begin to droop and wither in the sun; But still the life-blood flows, and does not fail, All into fruitfulness, all into form. Then comes the vintage, for the days are ripe. And surely now in its perfected bloom, It may rejoice a little in its crown, Though it bend low beneath the weight of it, Wrought out of the long striving of its heart. But ah! the hands are ready to tear down The treasures of the grapes; the feet are there To tread them in the winepress, gathered in; Until the blood-red rivers of the wine Run over, and the land is full of joy. But the vine standeth stripped and desolate, Having given all; and now its own dark time Is come, and no man payeth back to it The comfort and the glory of its gift; But rather, now most merciless, all pain And loss are piled together, as its days Decline, and the spring sap has ceased to flow. Now is it cut back to the very stem; Despoiled, disfigured, left a leafless stock, Alone through all the dark days that shall come. And all the winter-time the wine gives joy To those who else were dismal in the cold; But the vine standeth out amid the frost; And after all, hath only this grace left, That it endures in long, lone stedfastness The winter through:‚Äîand next year blooms again; Not bitter for the torment undergone, Not barren for the fulness yielded up; As fair and fruitful towards the sacrifice, As if no touch had ever come to it, But the soft airs of heaven and dews of earth;‚Äî And so fulfils itself in love once more. And now, what more shall I say? Do I need here To draw the lesson of this life; or say More than these few words, following up the text:‚Äî The Vine from every living limb bleeds wine; Is it the poorer for that spirit shed? The drunkard and the wanton drink thereof; Are they the richer for that gift's excess? Measure thy life by loss instead of gain; Not by the wine drunk, but the wine poured forth; For love's strength standeth in love's sacrifice; And whoso suffers most hath most to give. I speak to those who suffer:‚Äîthey will know, Better than I, the whole deep truth of it. I who stand here complete in all my flesh, Strong in the morning, sleeping fast at night, Taking the winds of heaven as they blow, Without a special sense save joy in each, Am not so much as worthy to stoop down And kiss the sacred foot-prints of my Lord Upon the feet of any such a one As lieth patient here beneath His hand; Whom Christ has bound on His own cross, to lie Beside Him, till Himself shall give release; And that shall not be, many a one knows well, Until his place knows him no more on earth. The Living Vine, Christ chose it for Himself:‚Äî God gave to man for use and sustenance Corn, wine, and oil, and each of these is good And Christ is Bread of Life, and Light of Life But yet He did not choose the summer corn, That shoots up straight and free in one quick growth, And has its day, and is done, and springs no more: Nor yet the olive, all whose boughs are spread In the soft air, and never lose a leaf, Flowering and fruitful in perpetual peace: But only this for Him and His in one,‚Äî The everlasting, everquickening Vine, That gives the heat and passion of the world, Through its own life-blood, still renewed and shed. God said to Man and Woman, ‚ÄúBy thy sweat, And by thy travail, thou shalt conquer earth:‚Äù Not, by thy ease or pleasure:‚Äîand no good Or glory of this life but comes by pain. How poor were earth if all its martyrdoms, If all its struggling sighs of sacrifice Were swept away, and all were satiate-smooth; If this were such a heaven of soul and sense As some have dreamed of;‚Äîand we human still. Nay, we were fashioned not for perfect peace In this world, howsoever in the next: And what we win and hold is through some strife Many are pains of life;‚ÄîI need not stay To count them;‚Äîthere is no one but hath felt Some of them,‚Äîthough unequally they fall. But of all good gifts, ever hath been health Counted the first, and loss of it to be The hardest thing to bear: I do not speak Of such imperfect passages of pain As show us we are mortal, and should stir Our hearts to greater diligence in life;‚Äî But such long weakness, and such wearing pain As has no end in view, that makes of life One weary avenue of darkened days, The bitter darkness growing darker still, Which none can share or soothe, which sunders us From all desire, or hope, or stir of change, Or service of our Master in the world, Or fellowship with all the faces round Of passing pains and pleasures,‚Äîwhile our pain Passeth not, nor will pass;‚Äîand only this Remains for us to look for,‚Äîmore of pain, And doubt if we can bear it to the end. And furthermore, from any other ill, Except it be remorse, can men escape By work, the healing of divinest balm To whomso hath the courage to begin, Not yielding to the bitterness of grief. Or if that tyrannously be denied, And the soul languishes in utter loss, Still hope of an immortal, better life Is left to every suffering innocence, And love of every sweet and noble thing, Though farther off than the far side of death; And faith to feed upon, and keep the heart Alive, through all the winter of this time. But sickness holds the sick man in a chain No will can break or bend to earthly use; Not only holding him in bond of space, Fixed in a rooted vegetable lot;‚Äî But bond of time, so that the Present makes All his possession, and he has no part In any other being, all his nerves Gathered and fixed in one intensest strain Upon the Present; and no future bliss, Nor harmony of past remembrances, Can draw him from the anguish of the hour, Or pay him back his loss, if loss it be. Is it indeed a loss, or is it gain? His Life is Pain, and he has naught besides: Most miserable must he be indeed, If this be wholly evil, as it seems. But if this be the hardest ill of all For mortal flesh and heart to bear in peace, It is the one comes straightest from God's hand, And makes us feel him nearest to ourselves. God gives us light and love, and all good things Richly for joy, and power, to use aright; But then we may forget Him in His gifts:‚Äî We cannot well forget the hand that holds, And pierces us, and will not let us go, However much we strive from under it. If God speak to thee in the summer air, The cool soft breath thou leanest forth to feel Upon thy forehead;‚Äîdost thou feel it God? Nay, but the wind: and when heart speaks to heart, And face to face, when friends meet happily, And all is merry, God is also there;‚Äî But thou perceivest but thy fellow's part: And when out of the dewy garden green Some liquid syllables of music strike A sudden, speechless rapture through thy frame, Is it God's voice that moves thee?‚ÄîNay, the bird's,‚Äî Who sings to God, and all the world and thee. But when the sharp strokes flesh and heart run through, For thee, and not another; only known, In all the universe, through sense of thine; Not caught by eye or ear, not felt by touch, Nor apprehended by the spirit's sight, But only by the hidden, tortured nerves, In all their incommunicable pain,‚Äî God speaks Himself to us, as mothers speak To their own babes, upon the tender flesh With fond familiar touches close and dear;‚Äî Because He cannot choose a softer way To make us feel that He Himself is near, And each apart His own Beloved and known. Sweet it is when a babe opens its eyes, Blue, smiling, to its mother's morning kiss. But thou, when waking to the morning light, With unrefreshed and aching limbs, mayst feel The heavy pressure of a constant pain Upon thy forehead, and the weary brows Throbbing beneath an unabated load. Is it not God's own very finger-tips Laid on thee in a tender stedfastness? The light and careful touches which to thee Seem heavy, because measured to thy strength, With none to spare;‚Äîand yet He does not fail For thy impatience, but stands by thee still, Patient, unfaltering,‚Äîtill thou too shalt grow Patient,‚Äîand wouldst not miss the sharpness grown To custom, which assures Him at thy side, Hand to thy hand, and not far off in Heaven. And when the night comes, and the weariness Grows into fever, and thy anguish grows Fiercer, and thou beseechest Him with tears, ‚ÄúDepart from me, O Lord, and let me rest!‚Äù He will not leave thee, He will not depart, Nor loose thee, nor forget thee; but will clasp Thee closer in the thrilling of His arms, No prayer of ours shall ease before their time. He gives His angels charge of those who sleep: But He Himself watches with those who wake. I know that some would here rebuke me, saying: It is enough to live and move in God With all Humanity, not seeking self In any such exclusive special bond, Which is not common to the whole of life. And others would take from us even that: Who deny God at all outside of us; Saying, There is no evil and no good, Nor anything at all, except ourselves, And self-created modes of our own brain, For all the living universe of God. The old false teachers, who at first seemed hard To nature,‚Äîbidding, Crucify the flesh To save the soul,‚Äîwere merciful to these; For these would crucify the soul itself, And stifle back upon itself the cry, And deepest craving of the human heart,‚Äî That which drew Moses to the Mount of Fire, That which shook David on his couch of tears, That which upheld Dante to Paradise, That which saved Byron through the depths of sin,‚Äî The unutterable thirst of man for God, The immortal part of us, if such there be. For me, I do not hold so hard a creed; Nor would refuse the comfort Christ implored. I, in the midst of those who suffer so,‚Äî Who needs must somewhat share the daily pain Which each of ye, Beloved, must endure, Must also seek some comfort, and some strength Of hope to live and suffer by;‚Äîand this Hath God given me, Beloved, for your sakes, To whom I fain would pass it. Bear with me, While unto each I seem to speak,‚Äîall ye Who suffer;‚Äîand I see around me none But suffers, but to whom, with reverence, These words of mine, these hopes of mine, are due. If suffering be indeed our Law of Life, If this world through our fathers' sin and ours, May not be perfect any more until The slow development of centuries Do bring to birth a higher race than we, It is so much the more a fitting school Of patience, for the time we must remain,‚Äî Of charity towards fellow-wayfarers Beside us bearing each his human cross, In secret or in sight, but each his own; And furthermore of hope, the unblamed hope Of the new world wherein all things are new, Where only their own works do follow them Who rest from pain and labour, and by faith And love have won a nearer step towards God. Hope thitherward for this life's recompense; For here what one sows must another reap, And children suffer for their fathers' sins While they live here; but in that other world Shall each man reap his own inheritance: Such heritage as he has left behind For those who follow here, who are the worse Or better for his sojourning with them. But if it be the worse, if the foregone Sin of thy parents or some other one's, (For our lives here are mostly in the power Of other lives, and each of us is bound To be his brother's keeper), have made earth Alien to thee, and poisoned at the fount The natural springs of joy, and set within The wheels of life a crook, that never more Swiftly and smoothly they may turn, and bound Weights on thy ankles,‚Äîwhat is that to thee, Who livest not for one time, but for all? God keeps account of that; only take care Those same pathetic haunting eyes of thine, For which some soul doth suffer punishment, Do meet thee not again in wife or child, Or sick man at thy gates, or starving man That wrought thy goodly raiment, or the brute And ignorant fury of the brotherless, Whose firebrand lights the roofs of palaces. Look not on thine own loss, but look beyond, And take the Cross for glory and for guide. For one star differeth from another star In glory and in use; and all are stairs Of the illimitable House of God; And every one has its own name and place Distinguished, and some special word is given For each to utter in the mystic song Which is not found in speech of humankind, Which is not understood by human heart, Even though heard by those caught up to Heaven, Who heard and saw, but could not tell the things Which they had heard and seen,‚Äîwhich neither men Nor angels, nor the conscious suns of space, Nor anything created, hears in whole; But that grows fuller, clearer, as we grow Nearer to God, with Whom is neither part Nor pause, Who gathers in one Infinite All number, sound, and space, and light, and law, Rejoicing utterly, eternally. And when God formed in the hollow of His hand This ball of Earth among His other balls, And set it in His shining firmament, Between the greater and the lesser lights, He chose it for the Star of Suffering. I think, when God looks down the ranks of Heaven, And sees them, not as we see, points of fire, But as the animate spirits of the spheres, He doth behold the Angel of the Earth, Stretched like Prometheus on the promontory, (Upon the outermost verge of rocky seas That sweep to shadow as they turn in Heaven, Swept with the earth, but trembling towards the moon), Bound to a perpetuity of pain, Willing and strong, and finding in his pain God, and his one unbroken note of praise In the full rush of cosmic harmony. But we are men, not angels. We abide Not on this earth; but for a little space We pass upon it: and while so we pass, God through the dark hath set the Light of Life, With wintess for Himself, the Word of God, To be among us Man, with human heart, And human language, thus interpreting The One great Will incomprehensible, Only so far as we in human life Are able to receive it; men as men, Can reach no higher than the Son of God, The perfect Head and Pattern of mankind. The time is short, and this sufficeth us To live and die by; and in Him again We see the same first, starry attribute, ‚ÄúPerfect through suffering,‚Äù our salvation's seal Set in the front of His Humanity. For God has other Words for other worlds, But for this world the Word of God is Christ. And when we come to die we shall not find The day has been too long for any of us To have fulfilled the perfect law of Christ. Who is there that can say, ‚ÄúMy part is done In this: now I am ready for a law More wide, more perfect for the rest of life?‚Äù Is any living that has not come short? Has any died that was not short at last? The ultimate symbol of Divinity How can we dream of? we have got no sense Whereby to seize it: but in Him we touch The ultimate symbol of Humanity, Humanity that touches the Divine By some fine link, intangible to us, Upon that side of mortal consciousness That looks towards Death; and we must pass the gates Of Death, linked with Him, holding by the hand Our Brother gone before, before we come To the perception how our life is joined To God's; for we are now the Sons of God, And know we shall be like Him there, but what We shall be doth not yet appear; but when We see Him we shall know Him as He is. And who shall be our Angels in the worlds That lie before us, or what Words of God, Unknown, unuttered, and undreamt of yet, May meet us there, how should we know or guess? And shall we then be restless in the search For other proofs and witnesses of God, Before our hearts have rested on the One He gave us in our very flesh to know? Impatient for the noonday, shall we miss The sunrise we shall never see again? And all the tender colours of the dawn,‚Äî The vision of the crimson clouds that hang Above us, and the lovely Morning-Star That will be vanished when the sun is high? ‚ÄîAs children might, impatient of the school, Despise the letters, longing for the songs And stories that they catch the echoes of. The songs are written, but first, learn to spell! The books will keep,‚Äîbut if we will not learn, We shall not read them when the right time comes, Or read them wrongly and confusedly. And each hour has its lesson, and each life; And if we miss one life, we shall not find Its lesson in another; rather, go So much the less complete for evermore, Still missing something that we cannot name. Still with our senses so far unattuned To what the Present brings to harmonise With our soul's Past. For must we not believe A soul, bred up in perfect rule of growth, And of obedience to the Will Divine Through all its stages, would be born in each In physical and spiritual harmony With that world's order as conceived by God; (However marred by time, and falling off, By disobedience, into pain and sin, Down to the actual order of the day)? And therefore Christ, conceived and born on earth So perfect, through foregone obedience, Came, and abode, and lived harmoniously With all the occult powers, the holy springs Unfallen of the waters and the winds, And the miracles of life within the blood, That at His voice or touch, still easily Obeyed, through laws of sense and soul at one; And lived with God in such untroubled love And clear confiding, as a child on whom The Father's face has never yet but smiled; And with men even, in such harmony Of brotherhood, that whatsoever spark Of pure and true in any human heart Flickered and lived, it burned itself towards Him In an electric current, through all bonds Of intervening race and creed and time, And flamed up to a heat of living faith, And love, and love's communion, and the joy And inspiration of self-sacrifice; And drew together in a central coil, Magnetic, all the noblest of all hearts, And made them one with Him, in a live flame That is the purifying and the warmth Of all the earth even to these latter days. But found one kingdom not in harmony; The sin and sorrow in the world, the stream Of evil, gathering on from age to age, With all its rocks and all its wrecks of life; And men's hearts hardened, and the tender lips Of women loud in laughter, and the sobs Of children helpless, and the sighs of slaves, And priests with dead lies for the living truth. And kings whose rights were in their people's wrong. And looking, the miraculous tender eyes, Upon these perishing and gone astray, Lifted the hands of help, alone, unarmed, Struck singly out, and dashed upon the rocks. And in that shock did meet His human doom Of suffering, and took it for a crown; The loneliness, the weariness, the strife, The base return, the Passion and the Cross, And the withdrawal of His Father's face. ‚ÄîSo that for ever since, in minds of men, By some true instinct this life has survived In a religious immemorial light, Pre-eminent in one thing most of all; The Man of Sorrows;‚Äîand the Cross of Christ Is more to us than all His miracles. And that most closely we may follow Him By suffering, have all hearts of men allowed. Is suffering then more near and dear to God For its own sake than joy is? God forbid! We know not its beginning nor its end; Is it a sacrifice? a test? a school? The fruit of Evil;‚Äîyet what Evil means None knoweth, though he spent his life to know. We suffer. Why we suffer,‚Äîthat is hid With God's foreknowledge in the clouds of Heaven. The first book written sends that human cry Out of the clear Chaldean pasture-lands Down forty centuries; and no answer yet Is found, nor will be found, while yet we live In limitations of Humanity. But yet one thought has often stayed by me In the night-watches, which has brought at least The patience for the hour, and made the pain No more a burden which I groaned to leave, But something precious which I feared to lose. ‚ÄîHow shall I show it, but by parables? The sculptor, with his Psyche's wings half-hewn, May close his eyes in weariness, and wake To meet the white cold clay of his ideal Flushed into beating life, and singing down The ways of Paradise. The husbandman May leave the golden fruitage of his groves Ungarnered, and upon the Tree of Life Will find a richer harvest waiting him. The soldier dying thinks upon his bride, And knows his arms shall never clasp her more, Until he first the face of his unborn child Behold in heaven: for each and all of life, In every phase of action, love, and joy, There is fulfilment only otherwhere.‚Äî But if, impatient, thou let slip thy cross, Thou wilt not find it in this world again, Nor in another; here, and here alone Is given thee to suffer for God's sake. In other worlds we shall more perfectly Serve Him and love Him, praise Him, work for Him, Grow near and nearer Him with all delight; But then we shall not any more be called To suffer, which is our appointment here. Canst thou not suffer then one hour,‚Äîor two? If He should call thee from thy cross to-day, Saying, It is finished!‚Äîthat hard cross of thine From which thou prayest for deliverance, Thinkest thou not some passion of regret Would overcome thee? Thou wouldst say, ‚ÄúSo soon? Let me go back, and suffer yet awhile More patiently;‚ÄîI have not yet praised God.‚Äù And He might answer to thee,‚Äî‚ÄúNever more. All pain is done with.‚Äù Whensoe'er it comes, That summons that we look for, it will seem Soon, yea too soon. Let us take heed in time That God may now be glorified in us; And while we suffer, let us set our souls To suffer perfectly: since this alone, The suffering, which is this world's special grace, May here be perfected and left behind. ‚ÄîBut in obedience and humility;‚Äî Waiting on God's hand, not forestalling it. Seek not to snatch presumptuously the palm By self-election; poison not thy wine With bitter herbs if He has made it sweet; Nor rob God's treasuries because the key Is easy to be turned by mortal hands. The gifts of birth, death, genius, suffering, Are all for His hand only to bestow. Receive thy portion, and be satisfied. Who crowns himself a king is not the more Royal; nor he who mars himself with stripes The more partaker of the Cross of Christ. But if Himself He come to thee, and stand Beside thee, gazing down on thee with eyes That smile, and suffer; that will smite thy heart, With their own pity, to a passionate peace; And reach to thee Himself the Holy Cup, (With all its wreathen stems of passion-flowers And quivering sparkles of the ruby stars), Pallid and royal, saying ‚ÄúDrink with Me;‚Äù Wilt thou refuse? Nay, not for Paradise! The pale brow will compel thee, the pure hands Will minister unto thee; thou shalt take Of that communion through the solemn depths Of he dark waters of thine agony, With heart that praises Him, that yearns to Him The closer through that hour. Hold fast His hand, Though the nails pierce thine too! take only care Lest one drop of the sacramental wine Be spilled, of that which ever shall unite Thee, soul and body to thy living Lord! Therefore gird up thyself, and come, to stand Unflinching under the unfaltering hand, That waits to prove thee to the uttermost. It were not hard to suffer by His hand, If thou couldst see His face;‚Äîbut in the dark! That is the one last trial:‚Äîbe it so. Christ was forsaken, so must thou be too: How couldst thou suffer but in seeming, else? Thou wilt not see the face nor feel the hand, Only the cruel crushing of the feet, When through the bitter night the Lord comes down To tread the winepress.‚ÄîNot by sight, but faith, Endure, endure,‚Äîbe faithful to the end! Is it then verily so hard to take With willing heart, and utter faithfulness? What better wouldst thou have when all was done? If any now were bidden rise and come To either, would he pause to choose between The rose-warm kisses of a waiting bride In a shut silken chamber,‚Äîor the thrill Of the bared limbs, bound fast for martyrdom?‚Äô ... But suddenly the words upon his lips Were broken,‚Äîfor a strange shock through the air Came flashing, and a southern-streaming wind Of violets, and strains of marching hymns, And throbbing stroke of drums that still came on Nearer, and tramp of thousands, and the songs That none of us had ever heard before, And a great cry out of the heart of Rome. And all of us grew pale,‚Äîand Ugo stood Pale in the midst; and one rushed in, and cried, ‚ÄòItaly! Italy! To arms! To arms! Milan is up! The Austrians are in flight. The King is at the war. Our time is come. Who is for God and Italy to-day?‚Äô And all the dark eyes from the pallets round Strained forward to the speaker; and we all Gazed on each other; and the setting sun Burst in one long ray down the walls of fire; And the old man, Luigi, who had lain So long and moved not, raised himself half up, With eyes that shone; and no one spoke a word,‚Äî But listened;‚Äîand the shouting in the street Grew, and the songs; and all the glorious gold Of the sunset broadened:‚Äîand we knew that we Had wakened:‚Äîand the new time had begun. IV. 1848. ‚ÄòItalia Una!‚Äô Now the war-cry rang From Alp to Etna: and her dreams were done, And she herself had wakened into life, And stood full armed and free: and all her sons Knew they were happy to have looked on her, And felt it beautiful to die for her. As at the unsheathing of the tulips, rose Her youth in armies from her soil that spring. Milan came first, then Venice, then the rest,‚Äî Padua, Treviso, backwards to the Alps; Osopo, Palmanova; every day Brought some fresh city to the muster-roll Of those who cast the Austrian yoke away. The Princes, too, had joined the Holy War; Savoy with passion, casting into it Heart, hopes, and fortune, heritage, and life; The others, because Italy had called Her children, and they could not keep them back. So every day fresh bands from all her coasts Were marching to her borders, and the sound Of trumpets went before them all the day. But higher than the note of trumpet swelled The heart of Italy; and faster beat The heart of Italy than all the bells That pealed on one another through the air. The stone of centuries in a day was rolled Back from her sepulchre, and such a face, And such a voice of resurrection, broke At the unsealing, that her foes fell back Astonished, and the day was all her own. Who can recall those days? We lived, we lived! The dawn was on the mountains, and our brows. Men wept for joy who had grown grey with care: And women crowned with beauty gave their lips Unto their lovers, saying, ‚ÄòThe last time, Till thou comest back from the baptism of fire!‚Äô And in the Holy Place the Pope stood up, The Father of his country, and proclaimed, ‚ÄòDepart, my children, to the Holy War!‚Äô And blessed their banners; and they gathered round, The flower of all the Roman youth, and knelt Beneath his benediction; and in sight Of all the people parted from his hands Towards Ferrara, in a brotherhood Of solemn exultation and of faith. The Cross surmounted the Italian flag; From highest to lowest there was but one heart In those bright days, one cloudless hope in God, One trust in one another uttermost, One sacrament supreme of life or death. The stir of the Crusade was in our ears; The stir of the spring-tide was in our blood; The hours flew by us as if shining steeds Were passing, panting, to a crimson dawn. But all the peace was gone from Ugo's eyes, And a strange fire was shining in their depths; And almost ere we knew it. he was gone; Passed to Ancona,‚Äîand the house in Rome Missed him through all its shadowy passages; And old Luigi not long after died. But there was too much moving life and noise Through Rome, for any to sit still and pine, Dreaming instead of doing. And the Pope Passed in and out among his people like The living standard of the Hope of God, Surrounded by their blessing and their love. I was of those who helped to raze the walls Of the Ghetto, in the Holy Week that year; For so the Pope commanded. And at night, Ciceruacchio and his hundreds came From Porto di Ripetta, calling all Who would, to help; and by the glorious moon We wrought with axe and tool and willing hands, Until the jealous walls were broken down, In token that henceforward all dark feuds Were passed away, and Italy was one. But I‚Äîas I passed homewards, and the owls Were hooting from the arches overgrown‚Äî Still heard the voice of Ciceruacchio ring Commanding, and the sound was pleasant still; The brave and bright and sympathetic soul In it, that made of a poor man the power To which all Rome paid homage gratefully. The Tribune of the People, who could stay A tumult by the lifting of his hand; And by the lifting of his voice could bring An army round him; and who, having naught But his own heart and hands, had made of them A kingdom, having for its own domain The hearts and hands of all his citizens. His name was Angelo Brunetti, but None knew him by that name: for when a babe, His mother, seeing him so wondrous white And ruddy, and with limbs that waxed amain, Half prophesying, in the Roman speech Had called him Ciceruacchio,‚Äî‚ÄòFair and Strong‚Äô; And still the name grew with him as he grew To stature stateliest, and strongest arm, And fairest face of all the city. Now His full prime was fulfilled, and he had won The crown and blessing of all people's praise, And trust of men even as he trusted God: But for himself had won no place or store. A poor man first and last, and earning bread By daily labour, having still to spare The service of a stout hand and warm heart For whomsoever was in wrong or need. It was not given me, who was little worth, To be with Ugo Bassi in those days, And in the days that followed:‚Äîso the tale Of how it fared with him, and what he did, Is incomplete for me. I can but give Such passages as have through many mouths Come to me; but they have not life to me Like what I knew myself. When he had been A few days at Ancona, thither sent For preaching, there arrived the gathering stream Of Volunteers, that still from every town Flowed larger than it entered, and went on Increasing,‚Äîfor it must be borne in mind That this was not a war of kings with kings, Or nations disciplined to their full strength, But of a people, rising for their own, Unarmed, untrained, unmarshalled, to the shock Of armies marching as one man in miles; And fortresses that frowned across the plains Against each other; and the settled strength And ancient order of the Empire which Of all the world embodied most the law Of Force, and Darkness, and Stability. It was as if a flower should fling itself Against a pine, and think that it would fall: Yet faith was in us, faith, which, some one said, Could move the mountains, and we had no fear. And those who gave their bodies often had No more to give; and those who had the gold And arms to give, were often held at home; So each one paid his part throughout the land, But all was voluntary, goods or life. But with the Volunteers, their chaplain came, Gavazzi, he a Barnabite as well; To whom spake Ugo, ‚ÄòLet me come with you!‚Äô And he with joy consented, being one In heart with him, and always a good friend: But Ugo was to him, himself hath said, ‚ÄòAngelo pi√π che amico.‚Äô And soon Was Ugo Bassi formally enrolled As chaplain of the Roman Volunteers, Second in order. So together they Went forward on the march to Rimini; And thence proceeded by the Emilian Way On to Bologna; whither, drawn in haste, Twelve thousand of the Volunteers from Rome Had gathered, waiting for supplies and arms. Here were the troops equipped and organised, So far as time permitted; and meanwhile, A living voice, a living face of fire, An inspiration, as of music blown From clarion-calls far off behind the hills, Where sank the sunset into light of dreams, Was Ugo, once more passing in and out Within his native city,‚Äîhe too bound By the red cross, and the tri-coloured sign, Into the ranks of death for her defence. And they entreated him: ‚ÄòSpeak once to us, Where all of us may hear thee. There is room In none of the great churches for the throng Of all who love thee; and besides we know, No friend is the Archbishop.‚Äô So they raised A scaffolding amidst the public square, Piazza Maggiore, stateliest Save one, in Italy,‚ÄîBologna's pride, With all its palaces and porticoes Looking upon the sunny space between, Where the bronze giant of the fountain stands Above the flowing of his own white waves. In front of the innumerable stems Of the stone forest, where a thousand hands Of sculptors on the doorways left their life, Upon the steps of San Petronio, stood The tribune, and upon it Ugo stood, The next day after Easter (which that year Upon the twenty-fourth of April fell): And there, when he had spoken from his heart Such solemn words as the hour brought to him He called on whomsoever would, to bring Their offerings to the treasury of war. And all day long the people came and went Unceasing, and the square was all alive With voices and bright colours underneath, And many feet repassing, and full hands: And in a ceaseless sweeping overhead Went to and fro the swallows, full of sound, With twittering, in and out the gilded shrines, And niches of the arches that support The watch-tower of the prison of a king, The windows of the Hall of Hercules, And all the carven capitals around;‚Äî They too in armies, building, making joy. But as upon an altar, rose the pile Heaped up round Ugo by the Bolognese: Gold pieces, yea and silver, rich and poor Alike outpouring, down to the last mite Of who were poorest; and the gifts besides Of household treasure or of handicraft. Some brought the humble wares of the day's work, By which they should have earned the daily bread; And others priceless heirlooms of delight, Kept sacred for the state of holidays; Venetian crystal, glimmering chains of pearl, Bosses of emerald on the beaten gold, And changing stars of diamonds; carven screens Of ebony, and silver caskets wrought With figures of the angels, ivory Finer than frost-work, lustre-trailing robes, Rich stuffs of Eastern colours, hoarded lace; With arms and horses, casks of meal and wine. None came with empty hands; and still the voice And smile of Ugo answered every one. Till in a moment's pause, his eyes were fixed, Where a girl, poor, but lovelier than the rest, Stept out barefooted from the swarthier throng, With grey eyes starry under moonlight brows, And hair too glorious for one flower or pearl To break its glittering miracle of waves; Blood of the ocean or some northern hills Marking the tenderer blue along her veins; She stood so formed, so coloured, from the rest, A golden lily among marigolds; But still her hands were empty and her gown Was but the blue of Venice, roughly wove. The eyes of Ugo met her, and the tint Of the wild rose flew up along her cheek, And deepened there, and full in front she stood, Gazing half-sadly,‚Äîand then suddenly Took from her neighbour's belt the hanging shears, Lifted her white bare arms, and from her head Sheaf after sheaf let fall the wondrous hair, Swiftly, till all was gathered, round her neck; And sprang towards Ugo, and upon his arm Laid heavily the cloud-like heaps of gold: And for a moment all the air seemed still, While those two fairest faces in the crowd Were leaning to each other in the light That flushed from each to each, and then drew back With a deep breath, parting without a word,‚Äî And she was gone in the press. And ere the red Had faded from his cheek, another stood Before him, all the people making way‚Äî A venerable woman, bowed and grey, And of the poorest, holding by the hand A youth with shining eyes and growing limbs, Almost a child‚Äîand saying, ‚ÄòTake my son! The last one left me.‚Äô So the day wore on. Durando was the General-in-Chief; Ferrari, General of the Volunteers. These crossed the Po; and by forced marches came First through Rovigo, then through Padua; then Were halted at Treviso, the last post To hold against the Austrian hosts, that now Were streaming down the passes of Tyrol. The line of the Piave was to hold; (The wide and desolate river which forbids Venetia to the stranger, sweeping through Two hundred miles of windings, wild and white, Without a bridge or city, and which keeps The music of the mountains to its close;) Since Nugent was already ravaging, With fire and sword, Friuli; and the roads Between the other rivers had been seized. Treviso is not only by its walls And forts defended; but upon one side Made unapproachable by the wide bed, And muddy banks of Sile;‚Äîtherefore here Was a firm stronghold of retreat for us. But further up, amongst the mountain-roots, Half-way from Feltre to Belluno, had The Austrians found a passage; and our troops Were moved to meet them. At Cornuda they Came face to face, and the first shock of arms Rang through the valleys. Through the long spring day The Volunteers against a threefold force Held their own ground, and when the night came down Remained the masters; and another day Of fierce and bloody conflict broke again, And still no succour from Durando came, And still they fought till evening unsubdued. But when all hope was over, and no aid Was possible, they fell for shelter back Upon the green and forest-sprinkled sides Drifted with heaps of apple-blossom snow Of Mount Belluno; and the sun went down Blood-red behind it, and the awful heights Above Cadore stood out one by one, And through the greyer gloom the glimmering white Came chilly, from the waste of waters spread In foaming network over many a mile Of sand and shingle, where Piave swept Below the green and dewy pasture-slopes, As Ugo went along with the retreat, Bearing the wounded up the rocky ways, From his first battle-field. And the next day They passed back to Treviso, where they held The enemy from further pressing on. Here, in the daily sallies that were made, Foremost amid the fire, unarmed, unhurt, Was Ugo Bassi, like a guiding star. In front of those who wavered, when the hail Fell sharp upon the young, unseasoned files; Beside the dying on the battle-field, Almost before the charge had swept aside; Lifting the wounded in the thickest press, And passing with his burdens to and fro Between the cannon and the ambulance; Soothing the long hours of the restless night Within the hospital;‚Äîentreated there With yearning anguish, and let go with pain‚Äî ‚ÄòAngel of Death,‚Äô as many a struggling soul Had sealed him surely with its last low moan. And with him others worked, and went, and came:‚Äî A friend of his, Felice Orsini, Younger than he, also a Romagnole, With dark and glorious eyes, and darker yet, Men said, because of prisons, and of dreams, And deathless passion for his native land. And General Guidotti, he who bore So much reproaching, and uncalled-for blame Because of the ill-fortune of the day He guided at Cornuda, that at last He said in bitterness, ‚ÄòWill Italy Not trust me to command? At least, I can Obey, and serve her:‚Äô‚Äîso resigned his post, And marched out in the ranks. And as it drew To the mid May-time, all the garrison Mustered in force for one determined stroke; And, issuing from the bridges, put to flight The Austrians in a well-contested day. But in the hottest of the struggle fell Guidotti, with a bullet through his breast. And Ugo in a moment at his side Was bending, seeking for the pulse in vain; When with a crash he too beside him lay, Shattered and senseless; and for many hours No succour came. And when at last he lay In his own hospital, they found the ball Had mutilated hand, and arm, and side, And torn a passage open through his breast, And lodged deep in the shoulder out of reach. In agony and fever many days He lay, and all around him deemed his wounds Must needs be mortal; for they still refused All healing; and the ball could not be found, Though searched for by the surgeons many times, With torments carried into deathly swoons, Yet unavailing; and the hero-heart, Suffering all things in silent steadfastness, Began to flicker to the shades of death. And by the next month it became too clear Treviso soon would fall into the hands Of the invaders; and it was resolved, In order that the wounded might not fall Also into their hands, to send them first To Venice. Thus was Ugo carried there, And painfully the journey was performed. A dream of dreams was Venice in those days Heroic; first and last, and silver star, That rose and set for Freedom while the name Of Italy was spoken. And of all Heroic citizens and noble names That guided and that guarded her, the first, By the consent and reverence of all, Was Daniel Manin. He, the head and chief Of the free city, came forth in her name, With honourable welcome, to receive Him whom all hearts were turning to; and stood Ready upon the Molo, just in front Of the two granite columns, as the barge Came down the Giudecca, carrying him;‚Äî Then stept bareheaded to the water's side. But his face changed to pain when he beheld The face that could not raise its eyes to him, And the cold hand that unresponsive lay Within his clasp. And those who waited there, Lifted him fainting and without a word, And bore him to the softest chamber spread In the still heart of Venice. There he lay, While gentle hosts beside him tenderly Watched, and attended on him, seeking ease And solace for the burning limbs in vain; And surgeons with their carefullest of skill Used their stern arts upon him; but the strife Was threefold‚Äîbetwixt art, and pain, and death. But still he smiled and suffered, thanking all, And saying, ‚ÄòIt is sweet for Italy!‚Äô Until, at one more trial, when at last The surgeons drew deep breaths, and said, ‚ÄòNo more‚Äî ‚ÄòWe cannot!‚Äô and he answered them, ‚ÄòGo on!‚Äô The ball was reached and moved;‚Äîand he had sunk Past consciousness: but those around him said, ‚ÄòHe will be saved if he has strength to live Through the next day.‚Äô But then began afresh The strife of life with weakness. Shadowy, Upon the borders of the angel world, Lay the pale, sculptured face, and wasted form For many weary weeks; and when at last The tide of life began to flow again, Though languidly, yet surely, he was moved Down to Chioggia, to the hospital, Where many wounded found their healing come In the sea-breezes. Here he stayed awhile, Hardly recovering, wavering to and fro In all the painful, fluctuating turns Of a frame torn and shaken utterly. Consumed besides by the impatient sense The war was passing, and he was not there; And troubled by forebodings as the days Went by, and fortune now began to flow The other way; and tidings came of towns Delivered to the Austrians, battles lost, And the King's army in retreat. And dark The clouds began to gather o'er the day That was so clear and splendid in its dawn. And faith and unity began to fail: The Pope first failing from the glorious place To which his people's hearts had lifted him; Receding from his word, and calling back The army that had gone forth in his name. So that the hearts whose loving reverence still Entwined itself with patriotic fire, Were torn asunder, and were forced to break One sacred bond, remaining at their posts; And knew henceforward, that not man, but God, Must be their helper and their guiding hand. All these things preyed on body and on mind, And made the tedious time more tedious still. A letter from Chioggia once was brought Into our convent, and I heard it read; It was from Ugo. This was some of it: ‚ÄòThe days go slowly, and the summer air Gives me no strength. Many a one lieth here More helpless than myself, but scarcely I Can make a shift to give a helping hand For any need. The days are sad and slow:‚Äî But sometimes towards the evening, I can rise And with uncertain steps pass out of doors, And breathe the cooler air. I sit and lean Upon the long low bridge that ends the street And crosses the lagoon. Down to my feet The shifting scarlet of the sunset-way Ripples across the waters of the waste. Behind me all the foldings of the sails Of many colours, and the mingled masts, And briny, tangled heaps of fishing nets Within the little port, come close and clear In the still blue flame of the air, full of the salt Sea-fragrance blowing over from the sides Of the Murazze. As from tower to tower The bells chime down along the lighted coast, Sweet voices answer them, and fisher-girls, Lovely, with depths of ocean in their eyes, Make music unto Mary of the Sea. Far-wavering distances of golden haze Flooding the blue of the Euganean hills, The visionary mounts of the soothsayers;‚Äî Whilst low and clear, one rose from shore to shore, Lies Palestrina, like a Paradise Of lovers lost, who in this hour at last Have found each other; and the skies and seas, And earth itself, are panting in the glow Of crimson; and the summer night is theirs. And up between, ‚Äúlike rubies loosely strewn Upon a silver mirror,‚Äù fade away To northward the innumerable isles, And towers, and little towns of the lagoon, In a far-shadowed purple vanishing. Yea, glorious is the last smile of the day, And the unutterable afterglow, Here, looking towards the sunset; and the war Lies out beyond it, and the restless heart Beats thither, and the trumpets seem to blow Far off, far off, behind the dying hills! ‚ÄòBut yet I turn, and to the other sky, Pale, grey, without the mountains and the glow Some hidden power compels me. I can see Flamingo-coloured flashes through the gloom Go southwards, and the white and wheeling wings Of sea-birds passing to the darkened shore; And I would fain be following them, and learn The mystery that lies for me in that land Untrodden; where Endanus flows out In sluggish labyrinths through the solitudes, Which but the brooding herons amid the pines Live in, and wander through, and find a home. Who knoweth all the winding ways of waters In slow and many folds about thy feet, O country that none loveth? Who hath crossed The forests of the reeds impenetrable? The willow-courses, where the flute-like notes Of ousel, and the darting kingfisher Make all the life? The undistinguished web Of river-branches, slowly drifting down The desolation of the choking sand Seawards, until they reach the trackless waste, The wilderness of waters in their ways, Where shore, and sea, and river lose themselves? ‚ÄòI ask them here, ‚ÄúWhat lieth to the South?‚Äù They answer, ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù And I ask again, ‚ÄúWhat men dwell there?‚Äù they answer me, ‚ÄúNot one.‚Äô ‚ÄúWhere goes the road then?‚Äù and they answer me, ‚ÄúBut to Ravenna, three days' journey off. But ere you reach it, you must make across The great pine-forest and the myriad mouths Of Po, and the vast shallows of the plain, With causeways stretching over the lagoon, Not land, not water, where the great eels lie, The Valley of Comacchio.‚Äù Aye, the name Haunts me! I rise out of my bed at night, And wish that I could wander there. My limbs Are weak. The moonlight muffles in a mist The land low-lying; from it comes a wail. I know not why, my heart is bowed with it, Foreboding, like a bulrush with the wind. Is it the Song of the Swans, that ever there Go mourning since the fall of Phaethon? Some deathnote peals across the water-wold, Pierced with the echoes of some shadowy doom; Some parting anguish of a soul in flight, Some melancholy mystery of fate. ‚ÄòI pass, I pass in dreaming out upon A wide waste plain, where rushes grow beside The trickling threads that lose themselves in pools Beneath old stones, all thick and dark with moss; Some little wild thing startled, springs and runs Before me, lost in swift and shadowy flight: And great grey moths with downy circling wings Lead me enchanted through uncertain ways, Where the marigold of the marsh is growing pale, On to the borders of a shimmering mere: As when a faded sunset shines below In silent waters, with the dark between Of land and hills, the light below, above, In sky and water,‚Äîbut the earth is dusk,‚Äî And all now gathers and grows dusk with it. And hardly now my feet know where they tread In moss, or swamp, or pool; and here and there A glow-worm sparkles tremulously green; And a great rustling in the water-flags, And thousands of shrill notes and dreary calls, And plashings, and soft stirrings of the sedge, Tell of the wild flocks that are nesting there. Was that a spirit went by me, all in wings That made the shadows glorious? Now again It brushed my face, and in a streak was gone,‚Äî The giant of the dragon-flies abroad. ‚ÄòGreat, hollow, hemlock-canes above my head Stretch out their straight, stiff arms; and all around The ceaseless croak comes up about my feet, And out into the dark and damp;‚Äîbeware! Black, shining, twining stems of poison-flowers, Blue blossoms beautiful, and deadly white, Catch at me with their rings; the osiers smite And blind me, and I cannot make a way. I stand and hear a swift and flowing sound Of waters close beside me, and I strike Away from them; and on the other side I come upon more waters, gurgling slow; Waters upon the right hand and the left; There is no footing, so I stumble on, Ankle-deep in the soft and slimy moss, Until I find an opening. Here is light In ghostly, fitful glimmers, as the coils Of water-snakes shine out in writhing knots, Or cleave the black, slow current, with a wake Of pale blue fire. The gliding Will-o'-the-wisp Hither and thither seems to float and fade Over black trunks that rot amid the stream, And lurid luminous vapour hangs outspread Hovering above the ooze; and I can see The long grey mosses swinging from the arms Of the old larches; and all things seem here Decaying in a stagnant solitude. ‚ÄòThe darkness shuts me in again, and I Go blindly, brushing past the rigid arms Of hideous giant horsetails, and my feet Tread out the burning milk-juice of the spurge, Until at last they find a firmer bed; And over them the horrible land-crabs Run swiftly, and slow-moving reptiles crawl Dimly beneath me. Now I feel the sand, And now the slippery hollows, as I pass Through the bewildering cane-brakes, till I gain The light once more. Lo, from behind the clouds The moon comes suddenly, and all the night Shines out in silver; and I come at last To a clear water's edge, a broad still stream, With one calm, onward ripple, breaking here Before me in the moonlight on the sands, The smooth white sands that make a level shore. Behind and over me the feathery reeds Make darkness;‚Äîbut before me all is light; The beautiful, broad water, winding on To where dark woods dip into it, and close; And out in the full wanness of the moon The armies of the sedges in their ranks, The shiver of their swords innumerable; And not a sound besides, and not a breath, Nor any footprint on the sands save mine. Yet here is something strange, that will not let My eyes be loosened from it:‚Äîscarce a mark In the fine sand‚Äîand yet I cannot fly This midnight vision of a new-made grave That stops me;‚Äîthere it lies unconsecrate. Now know I, I have reached my house of doom, No hope nor saving any more for me.‚Äî ‚ÄîWhat foolish visions of the night are these?‚Äô But though the cruel wound began to heal, Still Ugo languished; and his wonted strength Returned not to him; and he, suffering, craved The native air and old familiar streets Of his Bologna; and with care and pain Thither he was removed at his desire, And lodged among his friends; and slowly there He mended, and the life came back to him. But great good fortune now to me befell: For our good Prior, having much at heart To see Fra Ugo, and to speak with him, And having also business to transact Within Bologna, journeyed thence from Rome, And took me with him;‚Äîso it came to pass That I beheld my master's face once more. It was in August. I for the first time Beheld Bologna; and I was amazed To see so great a city, and the lines Of the long porticoes, that from the gates So far stretched upwards. As we passed beneath The leaning towers, I saw the ravens wheel About them, croaking, but I heeded not, My heart was full of the great joy so near. And when at last we stopped before a door Among the arcades, and up a stair had climbed My heart stood still before another door That opened to us, and we stepped inside A shaded room;‚Äîand, waiting for our steps, From a low couch, once more, at last, at last, The eyes of Ugo Bassi smiled at me, Out of the white and wasted face, that still Was the most beautiful that God had made. There was much stir and tumult at this time Within Bologna; for not long before, The Austrians under Welden had come down On her, defenceless; but the people rose In force and fury unforeseen; and drove Them out, and armed themselves; and thenceforth held And fortified their city; and stood firm In their municipal and ancient rights, Desiring to be ruled no more by priests. But the Pope's Legate sought by force of arms To repossess himself, and blood was shed; And all things were unquiet and disturbed; And all the citizens were under arms Against the Papal troops and the Swiss guard. Felice Orsini was also there, With other of the Roman volunteers Disbanded from Treviso, by the terms Of the capitulation, under bond To fight no more in Lombardy that year. He, having won the rank of Captain, held A leader's place among the boldest there; And kept a firm hand on the populace, Prone to excesses after long restraint. And, loving much my master, Orsini Came oft to his sick chamber; and one day, I, waiting there upon him, heard them both Conversing a short time in earnest tones; But Ugo's voice failed soon, and he lay there, Silent, and sad, until his friend exclaimed, ‚ÄòDost thou see aught, that thou regardest me So gravely? What is it displeases thee?‚Äô And Ugo answered, in a voice that came Slowly, and as it were without himself:‚Äî ‚ÄòThe shadow of a great doom within thine eyes.‚Äô ‚ÄòA doom! What doom?‚Äô Orsini answered him:‚Äî ‚ÄòWe are all in the same doom. Have we not sworn To know no rest till Italy be one, And rescued from the stranger? Did we think The day of our discharge would find us whole, And young, and ready for this life's reward? Does the red stand for rose-leaves on our flag? We have learnt better, thou and I at least. I have spent years in prison, when no hope Seemed possible; and knew my brethren then Were striving for me, and that prayers like thine Were rising for me‚Äîand now I am here: But bound in the same service,‚Äîand I know Its uttermost guerdon is the darkest death, And that the very face of Italy Shall not smile yet on those that die for her, And to that doom go forward undismayed. But whether thou, or I, or this one here, Or any other, shall be called the first, Or what shall be the calling, who can know?‚Äô And Ugo answered, still as in a dream: ‚ÄòYea, through the Shadow of an Agony Cometh Redemption‚Äîif we may but pass In the same footprints where our Master went, With Him beside us;‚Äîand for me, I fear No evil, since He has not failed me yet, Nor will, for ever;‚Äîand I know He will Be with me when I go to meet my hour: ‚ÄîBut thou, thou goest all alone to thine.‚Äô ‚ÄòLet me be lost, so Italy be saved!‚Äô Orsini answered; and went out from us. But the next day I sat beside the bed Where Ugo was asleep; and watched the flies Should not disturb him, for the heat was great; And marked the helpful hand relaxed and white, Laid on the coverlet; and anxiously Listened for the low breathing which assured He rested:‚Äîfor now, languid after long Fever, and pain, and weariness, he slept Hour after hour, and ever craved for more; And when awake was weary; and when left In quiet, quickly was asleep again. There was loud tumult in the town below; But coming through the sultry air, the noise Was not so harsh or near as to do hurt. But through the quiet house now quick steps came Ascending, and the door was pushed aside Hastily, and with jar, and Ugo woke; And gazed upon Felice Orsini, Who had burst in, with eyes and cheeks aglow And full of laughter, saying: ‚ÄòPardon me! But business is important, and admits Of no delay. I bring a message from A humble suppliant‚Äîif he were but here! The Cardinal-Archbishop‚ÄîI am told There is no love lost between you and him, And that there is good cause for it, and you Have a long score against him. Now your time Is come; he lies imploring at your feet. Will you forgive him?‚Äô Ugo smiled and said, ‚ÄòForgive him now? Nay, I forgave him then. That was eight years ago: but now, at last, What does he want of me?‚Äô Orsini said: ‚ÄòThe mob are up against him; and indeed They are not to be trifled with. He seems Far from beloved, if one may judge by what One hears and sees. Already they have forced The doorways, and have filled the inner court, And all the square is full of half-armed men, Clamouring and crying that he should come forth, And answer for his office to the Court Of Public Safety. But he dares not stir Nor show himself. He sent to speak with me, Entreating me to save him, and to get An escort that he might escape to Rome. But underneath the windows one could hear The people yelling like hy√¶nas, ‚ÄúWho Imprisoned Ugo Bassi?‚Äù and again, ‚ÄúRemember Ugo Bassi!‚Äù and myself Would rather stand before the Austrian guns For half a day, than stand for half an hour Before the fury of our Bolognese. I would not have him hurt; but for your sake, Was glad to have him frightened: so I said, As grave and stern as I could well appear: ‚ÄúTo Rome?‚ÄîYou hear the people name my friend; He is close by, as you are well aware. I think there are accounts between you two That might be settled better here than there. I must consult him.‚Äù But he begged and prayed: ‚ÄîHe had been forced,‚Äîhe had done nothing more Than his most painful duty,‚Äîand had borne Grievous suspicion, merely through his zeal In interceding for you;‚Äîfor himself, He always had admired you from his heart; You could not have a truer friend than him. His gushing love and his benevolence For everybody was so great, in short, He could not comprehend how they could show Such strange ingratitude‚Äîbut thought it was A dispensation of mysterious grace. But now, would you, and I, and his good friends Get him away? I need not stay to count The pastoral and apostolic showers Of benediction that should fall on us. But I can do it‚ÄîI can hold the mob In check, and I can use the civic guard, Masina too and Zambeccari stand By me, and we have all the Volunteers. He will be safe, but we must lose no time. But now, what message shall I take from you?‚Äô But Ugo on his couch had raised himself, With his eyes burning, and his feverish lips; And his voice trembled in its eagerness, As he spoke: ‚ÄòFriend, by all thou holdest dear, If thou hast ever loved me, show it now! O keep him safe and sacred! Promise me This day to hold his life before thine own: I do not say, lest one of his grey hairs Be harmed,‚ÄîI trust thee,‚Äîbut lest one rude word Come near him, one rough hand should hurry him. If he should suffer now the smallest thing, And for my sake, what then could comfort me? He hath been, ever since I was a boy, The Primate of this city, and revered For blamelessness and dignity of life. Besides I do believe that in his way He loves our Lord, and thinks that verily He did Him service in withstanding me. And if the people think of me, do thou Tell them from me, that if they would not tear Open my wounds afresh, and my heart too, They will part from him in respect and peace. And Orsini departed: but the time Seemed long; for Ugo breathed in fever-haste, And perilously glowed the sunken cheeks, And all the pulses rushed on one wild way: While the confused and brawling voices came, Now rising, and now falling, to our ears. At last Orsini's step was heard again Approaching, and he came up to the side Of Ugo, who had stretched his hands to him, And said, ‚ÄòHe is in safety. Be at ease. He had no trouble after I went back. The people listened to the words I spoke In your name to them: and I had good show Of force besides. He has an ample guard From here to Rome: and no one said a word Of insult to him after he came out. I rode beside him to the Roman gate, And there dismounted, bidding him farewell. But no one can describe his gratitude, And his affection both to you and me. The messages he charged me with to you!‚Äî How his paternal heart had ever yearned To you his best-beloved son, far more Than he had been permitted to express‚Äî How no one understood your worth like he‚Äî He seemed in fact to have but one regret Leaving Bologna,‚Äîthat was, leaving you. ‚ÄòAt least remember that, whatever comes, Monsignor Oppizzoni is henceforth Your most devoted slave. You cannot ask More of him than he will delight to give: He longs for opportunity to prove How true and steadfast can his friendship be; And his unutterable gratitude Shall spend itself meanwhile in prayers for you. And if, at any time, (which Heaven forbid!) Evil should threaten you, or danger press, Or any undeserved reproach be yours, Then count on him and all he has to use In your defence, and always be assured He could not have a greater privilege Than serving you. Pray keep him in your mind. He still repeats, your piety and mine Have saved his life this morning. Poor old man, One would not think that he had much to lose At his age! It seems really strange to me That saints should be so loth to lose their lives, And not more eager for the Paradise They say is specially reserved for them. He is a venerable man no doubt: His predecessors were less discomposed As they looked up, and round, and finally Settled their eyes upon the grated doors That held the lions, opening; nor let stir An eyelash as the bounds came o'er the sand, And round and round from earth to sky, the roar Of the Coliseum.‚ÄîSo at least they say. Bishops, I think, were different in those days; Our nerves, perhaps, are weaker. Anyhow, He is safe off, and no one seems the worse For losing him, nor inconsolable At his departure. Are you satisfied?‚Äô Soon after this I was obliged to leave Bologna and my master; and the next I heard of him was that his wound was whole, And he again had started for the war, Which now had died away in every part Save Venice: for an armistice was signed Between Savoy and Austria; and the Pope, And all the other Princes, had recalled Their soldiers; (only, up amongst the Alps, Forsaken, Garibaldi made a stand With his five hundred). But one city stayed, Queen of herself, a new republic, bound Not unto any court conveniences, But only unto Liberty and Death; And Venice now against her bore alone The whole revengeful pressure of the arms Of Austria; only God and her green seas Helping her; yet she held, and did not fail, The torch aloft, and looked not on despair. Ay, when the bells swing up in the Great Tower, Slow, slow, to battle, you may feel the air Begin to tremble, and it is as though Her golden hair streamed out upon the wind, And the white arms are lifted high in air, And the deep eyes are set against the storm, And the white breast begins to heave and glow, And all the waters in the ways below Move with her moving, and become alive. She was awake then, all the rest were dead. There were no treasures left in any house, For every citizen had brought his store Already to the Public Treasury, And all was melted down and used ere now. But her heroic hearts and hands were still Her own, to die when she died. And she stood, Girt to the battle with her golden robes, And with the jewelled breastwork for her shield, And the soft flowing waters for her walls, Against the cannon and the frowning forts And leagues of the blockade, and hordes of Huns. Thither departed Ugo with his friend Felice Orsini, and others, left Out of the Roman legion. At their head Was Colonel Zambeccari. They embarked, Twelve hundred, at Ravenna, in such boats As they could find in harbour, and arrived At Venice after stormy days of sea, And many perils from the Austrian fleet; And being landed, they were sent to guard The outposts at the fort of Malghera. Weeks passed: a silent enemy in front, The desolate breadth of the Lagune behind, Swift rushing of the Brenta on one hand, A stagnant channel on the other hand, Waters divided by the jutting fort, The marshes and the cane-fields all around, The mud embankments, the embrasured walls, The white mist rising round them every night, The pestilential air enfolding them, The autumn fever in the midst of them, Half of the garrison in hospital:‚Äî And Ugo Bassi, pale and suffering still, Moved, like a shadow of himself, among The stricken soldiers, falling every day Before the deadly arrows of this foe Invisible, yet did not fall himself. Seven miles of the canal and marsh between Mestre and Malghera; and Mestre stood, The outpost of the Austrians, fortified Anew, and armed with fresh artillery, And garrisoned by chosen regiments; The key of their position, and the gate Of the mainland. This was to be attacked. At ten o'clock one night the drawbridge fell, And all the garrison from every side Were mustered in the central fortress. There The orders were delivered, and all night Was spent in preparations. Orsini Was head of the first column on the right, And next to him, Fontana. Ugo marched Beside the same battalion, without arms. At nine o'clock they issued from the gates Of Malghera, and took the road that runs Alongside the canal. It was the dull End of October, and a heavy fog Had settled over everything, and hid All the dim plain, and muffled every sound. Silently, under cover of the mist, The companies of the attack crept on Until they had surrounded all the forts: And halted in their order, still unseen, Till the command should reach them to advance. Long time they waited, wet and chilled and stiff, Crouched in the ditches and behind the walls, Concealed among the cane-brakes without food, Till evening, and no word or leader came. At last, at six o'clock, there was one burst, All round, of firing, and the hour had come. On! straight at the forts! and over open ground, Under the cannonade from all the walls, Advanced the line at once to the assault. Knee-deep in water, through the flooded field They struggled to the fosse of the Lunette; But their wet arms could not return the fire, And still the Austrians mowed them down with grape. Then with one shout, ‚ÄòViva l'Italia!‚Äô Felice Orsini sprang, sword in hand, Straight to the walls, and all his company Rushed after him, and threw themselves upon The steep entrenchments in one desperate close. Half of them fell beneath the last discharge Of the defenders as they turned and fled Before the furious onset, and the rest Passed inwards. But among the wounded lay Fontana, with his right arm carried off, As it seemed, dying. Ugo stayed by him. But, hand to hand, from house to house the fight Raged on, and everywhere, from point to point, Back were the Austrians beaten, but gave way Slowly, in deadly struggle; and the night Darkened above the crowded combatants, And the broad moon appeared, and flames burst out In conflagration from deserted holds, Till all the place was lighter than by day. But many of the Austrians had been made Prisoners, and many slain; and of our own Many were slain or wounded; and at last, Past midnight, but a remnant on each side Held on through the last conflict, in a wild Crash and uproar of blood, and flame, and cries, Madness and rage of slaughter and despair, Round the last stronghold which the Croats kept,‚Äî The Villa Bianchini, pouring sheets Of flaming hail from all the windows, barred, And with spiked walls impregnable all round. Under the murderous fire Orsini led His columns driven back and back again; Some scaled the walls, some wavered, some were hurled Headlong upon the others,‚Äîall their fate Hung on the shock and strain of this last hour. The flag of Italy upon the ground Sank, with the standard-bearer; savage cries Rang with the volleys from the heights of stone. Then they saw Ugo in the midst of them, A flash, a vision, with illumined eyes, And in his hand the flag‚Äîand he was past, Above them high upon the perilous walls, Unarmed amidst the steel, and fire, and storm, And first within the palace, all alone Amidst the Croats, who beheld amazed, Suddenly there against the flaring sky, The terrible bright face of the gold-haired monk, With the streaming banner and the lifted hand, And the red cross upon his breast; and some, Bewildered with the long and furious night, Shrank back, and said awe-stricken as he passed, ‚ÄòSt. Theodore for Venice!‚Äô But he cried, ‚ÄòSurrender, and I spare you! Pile your arms, And go before me !‚Äô and like sheep they went, Driven before him down the stairs; and he Passed to the lower story, and the shots Ceased, and the disarmed Croats on their knees Cried ‚ÄòQuarter!‚Äô But he said, ‚ÄòUnbar the doors;‚Äô And they obeyed him. At the bayonets‚Äô point Orsini, with his soldiery, pressed on, Who, too infuriate to stay or spare, Sprang on their prey, and massacre began. But Ugo in the doorway fronted them: ‚ÄòThey are my prisoners, and their lives are mine!‚Äô And Orsini struck back with sword and shout, The foremost of the maddened, entering throng; While piercing rose, and terrible, the cries For mercy, and for vengeance, drowning those. But in the shattered doorway Ugo stood Before the Croats, and his fiery eyes Flashed on the bayonets, and he snatched and held The crucifix to meet them, and his cry Rang over theirs: ‚ÄòStand back! You shall not pass, But over my dead body and stretched arms, And trampled cross of Christ!‚Äô And they fell back, With all the force and fury out of them; And the two hundred prisoners were secured, And all was over, and the place was won. Six cannon, all the military stores, And all the papers of the Austrian staff, Seven hundred prisoners, and all the forts Of Mestre, fell into our hands that day. But there were heavy losses; and among The chief who perished was Poerio,‚Äî The younger, Alessandro, who, a boy, Took arms for freedom thirty years ago, And out of exile sent the songs that stirred His country's heart, and now received his crown; After five days of agony, he breathed His last in Ugo's arms, at peace in Christ, And with his mother's name upon his lips. That was almost the last of the campaign. Soon afterwards the Roman legion came Back to Ravenna; and as they passed through, They halted for a day or two, and there, As Ugo knelt and kissed the sacred stone That covers Dante's grave, the multitude Followed his steps, and would not let him go Till he had spoken to them. Those who heard, Said that his words sank down into their hearts As never words before,‚Äîso grave and strong,‚Äî As he laid charge upon them never more To trust in priests or princes, who had failed, But to trust God and their own hearts alone; And now to keep back nothing of their lives From God and from their country. Then he came On to Bologna, and soon afterwards To Rome again. Ah, there was joy with us When Ugo Bassi had come back to take His lodging with the brotherhood once more! But as it were his ghost at first he seemed, So worn and pallid from his toils and pain; Yet as the days went on, and the new year Drew into light, his strength returned to him, And the old looks returned to greet our eyes, More beautiful than ever, and new hope And life were stirring in our hearts again. Rome:‚Äîthere was such strange tumult in her midst, Of reawakening spirits, that it seemed As if the Dead from all the Catacombs Had risen to live and die again for her. The Pope had fled, and left no power behind; And rumours came that both from North and South The armies of the Stranger were in march Against the Holy City for his sake. But she was free, and held her own awhile; And there were bonfires in the streets, and shouts, And hymns of liberty, and chime of bells, And marshalling of troops for the defence. Nor did I understand all things that passed: But this I felt, that day by day, my life Quickened and deepened, and with broader flow Swept to the ocean; and I had become, Not only human, from unconsciousness, Not only Christian, from the Pagan lore, But Roman also, and a citizen Of no mean city,‚Äîbut of the world's heart. And this was borne upon me by sweet winds, That blew, or so it seemed, and cleared the air About us, as for some great sacrifice,‚Äî That Rome was now to live again once more, And not for Italy alone, but for Humanity, and that we too were bound, Without escape, to live and die for her. I cannot tell how these things came to me.‚Äî About this time I once heard Ugo read A letter which, he said, was for us all; He named a name which then I did not know. It said: ‚ÄòI listen for a voice from Rome, Some sound as of the reawakening stir Of a whole people to their former height:‚Äî I do not hear one worthy of her yet. O Romans, had you but the will, the power Is yours, this day, to mould the world anew! You hold within your hands the destiny Of Italy, and, soon or late, must that Become the world's. It has been ever so. Do you not know the spell of potency In those four letters that make up the name Of Rome‚Äîof Amor? Know you not that that Which uttered otherwhere is but a word, If uttered once by Rome becomes a fact, Henceforth her own Imperial Decree, Urbi et orbi. I, the worshipper Of Rome, have watched and waited for this day, Knowing that unto her alone belonged The Mission, that the Word could only come From the Eternal City. Grant it, God, That now at last the times may be fulfilled! ‚ÄòHas ever Providence so plainly said To any nation: You shall have no god But God; you shall have no interpreter Of His law but the People? Have you not Beheld this war, already three parts won, Lost when you gave its guidance to a King? The Pope, a voluntary fugitive, Has left you. Without violence or design The way has been made plain before your feet. You have no longer any Government, Nor any power legitimately owned. Rome is to-day by the sole grace of Heaven A free Republic:‚Äîand this day is yours, Once, and once only, for a choice, to take Your glorious destiny upon yourselves; And gather to the heart of Italy In unity her delegates elect, To utter forth the word to all the world Which God shall through the People then declare, And henceforth live‚Äîor die‚Äîaccordingly.‚Äô This winter was the mildest that had been Within the memory of man at Rome; The skies were soft and sunny every day, And the red roses bloomed the winter through. And ere the spring had well set in this year, Another Rose had blossomed on the earth, Another crimson in the morning sky, And the Republic was proclaimed in Rome. And late one night, in the first days of March, When beds of violets scented all the air, And marigolds were in the springing grass, Came Ugo Bassi home;‚Äîand as he passed Spake but these words, with radiant, awe-struck face That lighted all before him, ‚ÄòI have seen Mazzini!‚Äô‚Äîbut I knew not whom he meant. V. 1849. (‚ÄòNay! not from you to me, from me to you, Romans, this homage of our love should pass. For all the good that I have sought to do ‚ÄîNot done‚Äîfrom Rome came to me. Rome has been Ever for me a talisman. In youth I found this record written, that whereas In every other country nations grew, And spoke their passage in the world's great song, Then fell, to rise no more in pristine strength, One only city was endowed by God With power to die and then to rise again More glorious than before, and to fulfil A mission nobler than fulfilled before. I saw this Rome arise, Imperial, With empire from the rising of the sun To his unfollowed setting in the sea Beyond the Gates of Hercules,‚Äîher laws Written in landmarks still through every land. And this Rome I saw perish, overwhelmed By floods of the barbarians. From her tomb I saw her rise again, this time more great, In virtue of a victory, not by arms, But by the Word of God; and in His name Claiming and wielding sovereignty of souls. I to my heart said‚ÄîThere is yet to come More: for a city which, of all the world, Alone has seen two splendours rise and fall,‚Äî The last the first transcending,‚Äîyet must see A third. All things must follow to their fate. Following the Rome which wrought by force of arms, Following the Rome which wrought by force of words, Must come, so was it shown me long ago, The Rome which yet shall work by force of life. Rome of the C√¶sars, passed away so long; Rome of the Popes, passed but a little while; Rome of the People rises from you both.‚Äî And now the Rome of the People has arisen. Here, in this Rome, I greet you;‚Äîand this hour Has room in it for no less sacred word. ‚ÄòNothing have I to give you of my own, Nothing have I to promise of myself, Except that I am with you, one of you, Whatever work you now may have to do For Rome, for Italy, and for the weal Of humankind in Italy. We shall Perhaps have more than one sharp step to cross, More than one solemn sacrifice to make, More than one battle with our gathering foes: But with the aid of God we will go on To victory. I trust that nevermore, So grant it, God, the stranger's scorn may say, This light from Italy, this blaze from Rome, Is but a Will-o'-the-wisp among the tombs. Not so, the world shall hail it as a star, To set no more, pure, everlasting, bright, As those which glow in our Italian sky.‚Äô These words were spoken on the Sixth of March;‚Äî The first time that Mazzini stood within The Capitol, and knew his time was come.) But before long, I too had learned to know Mazzini,‚Äînow a citizen of Rome, And First of the Triumvirate; by voice Of the Assembly and the People given The post of honour and of danger, kept By Rome for heroes in her hours of fate. And next to him, two men were worthy found Of the same touch of fiery laurel-leaf; Aurelio Saffi,‚ÄîArmellini;‚Äîthese Moved with one mind, and Rome was glad of them. For he was here at last,‚Äîthe man whose dreams Had seen her in his youth, a queen as now, While other eyes had seen but her decay. He who had prophesied of this young Rome, Who amid scorn and peril had consumed His days and nights for her, had worked, and watched, And suffered for her till the hour was come, And she was born again, a splendour strange, Out of the travail of his soul,‚Äîa dream Now in the world's full daylight come to pass. And she, immortal, as it seemed new-born, Bathed in the golden sunshine of the spring, Looked lovely as a bride may look, who knows Her lover's eyes are on her; and rejoiced. And I too sometimes, passing in the streets, Beheld himself; it was a face which now I cannot write of,‚Äîbut I see it still. The glorious, fiery eyes, the living light That made the world like one grand smile of God.‚Äî On all sides there was arming those first days Of the Republic, to resist the hosts Of Austria, but we felt no fear of them, For everywhere, along the streets and walls, Might we behold large letters: ‚ÄòIn the Name Of God and of the People!‚Äô and then came The order of the day, and it was signed ‚ÄòJoseph Mazzini, Citizen of Rome.‚Äô The name, the eyes, the voice, were in our midst All day; the living hand was holding ours; We felt that God was with us. For myself, I could not understand the words of him Who spoke as if His Prophet;‚Äîbut I saw How Ugo Bassi, with dilated eyes, Drank them in day by day, and each day grew More glorified to look on, as if now No spiritual need were unfulfilled. My Master had been great to me till now, But now a greater One than he appeared,‚Äî His Master, and the Master of us all. To live through but one perfect hour of life, With hope enlarging all the space beyond, Is better than a life-time, and more long, Looking back on it: thus it seems to me That time was long, because it was so fair. But none loved Ugo as Mazzini loved; Who one day sent for him, and said to him, ‚ÄòI have a gift to give thee, which thy heart Shall some day thank me for; I have not found Another worthy of it; I appoint Thee to the post of peril, as the priest Of Garibaldi's legion. Go to him, And take this letter under hand of mine. And when thy crowning cometh, think of him, Thy friend who loves thee and who parts from thee. And Ugo took the letter, and obeyed; Half grieved to leave the golden hours of Rome, Half glad for stirrings of new destinies, Half conscious of a solemn seal of fate. For no one yet in Rome had ever seen The face of Garibaldi; but strange tales Were told of him, and of the fearless few Who from America had followed him; Of their rough fashions, and their wild attire, And the mysterious fortunes of their Chief, Who in remote and unknown lands had grown To some strange power and leadership of men, And now had risen up at his country's call, For her Deliverer in her hour of need, With his own army and no law but his; And by a perilous and hard-won way Was now advancing on the road to Rome, And halting at Rieti. Thither came Ugo, as the Republic's messenger. The rushing green Velino serpentine Enrings the towers foursquare, and the red roofs Crowded and piled within the ancient walls Of the Sabine City; and the green plain round Lies one great garden of the vine in spring; And, twelve miles off, an amphitheatre Encircles it, of mountains, tender-toned, Like harmonies of music turned to shape. And it was morning, when before the tent Of Garibaldi, Ugo Bassi stood; And the unknown commander from the door Advanced to meet him, drest, as was his wont, In the white mantle and the scarlet vest, Bare-headed, with the lion-flowing locks: And greeted him with grave face and few words. But Ugo looked at him, and speechless stood, As in a vision; and his breath came short; And shadowy changes swept across his face, While still he gazed;‚Äîand all at once he spoke: ‚ÄòI have seen thee, I have seen thee! In the cell Above the rushing of Potenza, when I had no hope, and even God seemed gone;‚Äî In mortal sickness, when the agony Let go, and left me sinking back to life;‚Äî In the long vigils, as it grew towards dawn Through the grey aisles of the Basilica;‚Äî In flickering nights of fever, when my wounds Burned, and the hospital was full of groans;‚Äî In the last thunder of the guns, when all The air was dim and sulphurous with smoke, And I was lying on a field well-won;‚Äî By deathbeds, when the pain had left the limbs;‚Äî Yea, in the fainting close of the Passion-Week;‚Äî I was aware of one who came and went, But never stayed by me so long, that I Might catch the form;‚Äîbut sometimes in my dreams I saw it and I knew it:‚Äîit was thine. I could not hold the dream back as I woke; I was seeking, and I knew not what I sought: But now I am waking, and I see thy face!‚Äô And over Garibaldi's eyes there came A soft deep darkness, and he stretched his hand To Ugo, and the two stood face to face, The silence thrilling round them like a march Of music at a hero's funeral, Until the voice of Garibaldi spoke:‚Äî ‚ÄòWe two can be no more parted, save by death.‚Äô And from that hour was Ugo Bassi's place At Garibaldi's side; and never more Did any day divide them; and it seemed As if the day long were too short to ease The lifelong burden of their hearts, till now Unknown unto each other, and apart. And Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòIt likes me ill To see a white dove in a raven's nest: Or thy bright face above the monkeries Of the black habit of the Barnabites. Is it so dear to thee?‚Äô And Ugo said, ‚ÄòNowise;‚Äîsince I have suffered at the hands Of priests too many things to love their dress But I abide as it was laid on me.‚Äô And Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòI lay on thee Another rule, another uniform; Wilt thou receive it?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòWith joy Whatever shall thy hand require of me, Whatever shall thy hand impose on me, Shall be to me a law, as at the hand Of God and of my country, sweet, if stern.‚Äô And Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòI have not much Of worldly goods; but I have some to spare, Since I have shirts of scarlet two, not one; Both are the worse for wear, but they will hold; Thou shalt have one, and wear it for my sake, Who wore it first; and thou shalt leave the black Garb of the priesthood which I most abhor, And all my soldiers hate the sight of it, And will more gladly hear thee, if thou come In their own colours in the midst of them.‚Äô And Ugo Bassi answered, ‚ÄòYea, so far My heart goes with thee; and from thee to me Such gift were glory of investiture: But yet I cannot carry arms of death, Whose mission is for saving help alone In need; nor can I leave the crucifix, The only weapon which hath heretofore Gone with me through all storms of blood and fire, And which must be my armour to the last.‚Äô And Garibaldi, musing, answered, ‚ÄòMine Is a bright colour for a battle-mark, And a gay show upon the open hills, Or in the streets of cities; but the fire Of life burns in it to intenser flame. It is not for the splendid sun alone, Nor for the trumpets, and the horses' feet, And all the bells outringing, till the dome Of the blue sky seem one Campanula: It has a thought of other hours with it. Christ wore it when He wore the crown of thorns, When first He took His kingdom from their hands; And the bright maiden wore it to her death, Whose knife avenged Humanity and France. Who wears has chosen; and whoso weareth it Must wear it to the perilous posts of fate. Rejoice with me to-day, for it may be Some day that thou wilt suffer for me too.‚Äô And Ugo said, ‚ÄòThen will I more rejoice.‚Äô And with his own hands Garibaldi put His scarlet mantle on him, and he threw About his neck the slender silver chain On which he carried still the crucifix. And in such guise the golden-gleaming hair, And the inspiring eyes, and tender brows Shone glorious, and it seemed an angel went Among us; and for ever afterwards Did Ugo Bassi wear the scarlet vest. In hurried marches Garibaldi crossed Hither and thither, on whatever side The enemy was threatening, keeping clear The Roman country; and from place to place Passed Ugo with him, not as priest alone, But, though unarmed, as a chief officer‚Äî The orderly who from the General's side Carried his messages to every point Of peril, and who bore by word of mouth The call from one to another through the field; And for this service Garibaldi gave The fleetest and most fiery of his steeds To be his own‚ÄîFerina; and the horse And rider were the noblest in the camp. And in those days, the height of the spring-tide, The voice of Ugo Bassi was a voice Which any man once hearing could not rest Till he had heard again, and which, on days When he was preaching, drew beside the tents The scattered dwellers of the forest lands In thousands, ignorant of why they came, Longing and listening, passionately thrilled As if by music of another world. The wild, fierce legionaries, with no law But Garibaldi's, round him reverently Knelt, for the first time praying, till his word Subdued them to some likeness of himself, And all the camp became a House of God. Once of himself, about this time, he spoke These words upon the freeing of his soul From all the bondage of its early yoke: ‚ÄòNow have I found obedience that is joy, Not pain, not conflict of the heart and mind, But harmony of human souls with God. Some law there needs be, other than the law Of our own wills; happy is he who finds A law wherein his spirit is left free. Heretofore had I often need to bend The manhood in me to a childish law, And, breaking my own will, broke God's will too. Yea, I have borne hunger, and cold, and pain, Submissively, as at the hand of God, And put off my own will, and uttered speech, Or kept long silence when my heart was full, And stayed, or gone whither I would not go, Seeing no reason, much less asking it. But now no more;‚ÄîI will not bend again My spirit to a yoke that is not Christ's; A law that is not of the public voice, Sacred as God's voice in the midst of us, Approved by conscience, tried by wisdom, used By rulers royal in their nature's right;‚Äî But law of man to man, without consent Of reason or of justice, and which sets The smallest tyrant in the place of God, Yea, oftentimes the weak above the strong. ‚ÄòThe Word of God henceforth shall be enough For me to live by; therefore I renounce This priesthood, which has well performed its part, Holding the lantern of the Word of God Through the dark places of dark ages past; But now gives place unto the higher law Of God the Father, and all men His sons, Without the priest between. Thou hast not left Thyself, O God, without Thy witnesses! Thy highest are upon the earth to-day, Thy Prophet and Thy Soldier. I obey Him of the sorrowful dark eyes, whose smile Is as the lightning opening up the heavens; And him whose voice above the battle-charge Rings clearer than the silver trumpets blown At Easter. Yet, obeying them, I yield No further than Thy law within my heart Consents to it;‚Äîand yet I do not fear Strife in this service, nor a broken bond. ‚ÄòYet let not any think, because I part Myself for ever from the bonds which priests Have fashioned for our souls for centuries, It is for any pleasure of the world, Or softness of the flesh renounced before, Or solace of an unknown tenderness. I do not claim life's sweetness, but I claim Life's liberty, the birthright of a man. If I withdraw, it is not now to seek Aught that could make life dearer to myself. I have not passed so many years of life, Uncomforted of earthly joys, to need Such comfort now. Art Thou not mine, O Lord? I do not think that I shall find a friend More tender than the One that I have found; If He stay by me, I desire no more.‚Äô Once more the Holy War was on the lips Of all Italian people; and once more The hearts of all the nation throbbed with hope Together, and with an exulting sense Of one whole year of Italy achieved. King and Republic on the Lombard plains Made ready to receive the shock once more Of Austria's armies, and one brotherhood Ran through them all, and knitted them in one. In Rome we waited in a breathless pause For the first tidings from the battle-field. It came, it came,‚ÄîNovara!‚Äîall at once The thundercloud burst on us overhead, And the stroke fell, and Italy was lost, And we had nothing left us but despair. Out of all Italy there now remained Rome, Venice, and Bologna: we began To see that crown which had been promised us Was such a crown as death-struck brows might wear; And that the time was past for any hymns But such as might be sung in Passion Week. But he who was among us did not lose The sweet calm smile, the deathless eyes divine That shone the more unwavering as the gloom Grew deeper; and throughout the length and breadth Of Italy, now fallen, he sent forth This Proclamation: ‚ÄòFellow-countrymen! ‚ÄîPiedmont betrayed, and Genoa fallen,‚Äîall The soil of Italy given up again To tyrants or to strangers,‚Äîstill the life, The true life, of our Italy, in Rome Gathers itself. Let Rome then be the heart Of Italy; and back from her shall flow The vital energy, the living warmth, Through all the scattered members of our race; And so the name of this fresh Rome of ours, The Rome of the Republic, shall be blessed. ‚ÄòTo Lombard, Genoese, and Tuscan, all Our brothers in one country and one faith, A mother's arms are opened here by Rome. Here may the soldier find a camp, and here The unarmed may find shelter in our walls. For us is nothing altered. Strong in faith In God and in the People, we remain Immovable, and still inviolate Uphold that banner we are bound unto. Rome is the home of things eternal. Be Then this Republic an eternal thing, For the salvation of our Italy, Which now for inspiration looks alone To Rome. Here solemnly do we declare That this Republic, the asylum now, The bulwark of Italian Liberty, Will never yield, and never compromise. Witness, ye Romans, in the Name of God And of the People, the Triumvirs swear Their country shall be saved!‚Äô (Yea, saved by fire The soul of it was for the after-days: But they who swore it did not save themselves.) Suddenly rumours, vague and strange, arose Of a French army landing on our coast; And with vague doubts, ‚ÄòIs it as friends or foes?‚Äô But he who ruled us said, ‚ÄòLet us not wrong A noble nation by so base a thought, That they in face of God and man should break All faith, all honour, and should fall on us Without a word:‚Äîrather let us believe They come as brothers in our hour of need.‚Äô But there was none could shake the shadow off, That flew as if with moaning of the wind. It was the end of April, the last day But one; and in the morning entered in A stranger band of warriors through our gates. Five hundred of the flower of Lombard youth, Of noble lineage, and heroic proof‚Äî The Bersaglieri, with their floating lengths Of black plumes, and their dark-green uniform. Enrico and Emilio Dandolo, The brothers,‚ÄîMorosini,‚Äîand their chief, Lucian Manara, foremost. They had come, Having defended Milan to the last, After the fall of Lombardy, to find A grave in Rome. ‚ÄòFor you have need,‚Äô they said, ‚ÄòOf every soldier you can muster now. The French are on you. Hardly could we make Our way in arms to you across the lines Of Oudinot, who holds the shore and forts, And kept us back from landing. We have marched Here from Civita Vecchia, but obtained A passage only through the terms we bring, Proposing to you:‚ÄîTo surrender Rome Into the hands of the French General, Who will be by to-morrow at your gates, (And guarantees the interests of all, A moderate and judicious liberty Under the flag of the French Government;‚Äî) Or failing free and peaceable consent, Be ready to submit to him perforce. ‚ÄîWe are at your disposal to the death.‚Äô And travel-worn, and toil-worn from their strife By sea and land, this young and noble band Of her defenders through the streets of Rome Passed, with acclaiming of the multitudes. And the Assembly met in haste, to frame An answer to the summons, and resolved That to no foreign force should Rome submit, But should defend herself, and hold her own. Yet some there were who wavered, and who said, ‚ÄòIt is in vain. To overwhelming force Let us submit in time: we must at last. Where have we arms enough for our defence?‚Äô Whereon Mazzini answered, ‚ÄòI have faith In Rome. It seems to me, I understand This Roman people better than yourselves. Let us now summon all our legions here Before the Palace, and here proffer them The question, Peace or War?‚Äô And from the ranks One universal shout of War! arose, And drowned all timid counsels and weak doubts. And for the rest, Mazzini in his heart Held his own counsel: for he after said, ‚ÄòWell did I know that Victory for us Was equally impossible without Our ramparts or within them. But I knew, Therefore, that since it was our fate to fall, It was our duty, for the future's sake, For us to turn on Italy from Rome Our last look loyal,‚Äî‚ÄúMorituri te Salutant!‚Äù‚Äô So the doom of Rome was sealed. All Rome was turned into a camp that day; In haste and tumult for her own defence. All day incessantly the Romans worked Upon the walls, the gates, the barricades; The batteries were strengthened, and the charge Laid in the cannon; all along the ridge Of Monte Mario with the cypress-groves, The bastions were repaired and fortified, And the battalions of the guard encamped. All the vast square of the Basilica, Saint Peter's, with its pillared colonnades, Was turned into a camp; and open stood Porta Angelica; while through it pressed The clamorous streams of peasants, with their droves Of sheep and oxen, and their loaded wains; And breathlessly, amid the martial stir, The people waited for a great event. The sun was going down, when suddenly Along the dazzling streets a cry arose Of ‚ÄòGaribaldi! Garibaldi!‚Äô‚ÄîThere Was the mysterious hero, come to us Unsummoned, and unknowing of our need, But sent by God to us, upon the eve Of battle. After him, his legions came; But slowly, slowly, through the multitudes That swayed in wildest welcome round his path, And made the air a waving wind of joy, As if the Archangel Michael from the clouds Had lighted, to the succour of the great Beleaguered city. While amidst them all, He with deep eyes, silent and resolute, Rode slowly up the steep of golden sand To San Pietro in Montorio. And who was this came riding after him On the white battle-horse? As he passed by, With the monk's garment gone, and the unshorn hair Floating, and the starry, rapture-lighted eyes Among the Romans, I myself drew back, At first amazed, and thought I had not seen A manhood so majestic yet on earth. But when his eyes fell on me, and he said, ‚ÄòAntonio,‚Äô then I knew the tender voice Was still the same, and would not change for me. They held a bivouac in Saint Peter's Place. All night the watch-fires blazed, and torches flared, And sound of hammers and of hurrying feet Through Rome resounded; with the dawning came A lull, and we were ready. Dull and grey That morning of the thirtieth April broke. It was one hour before the stroke of noon‚Äî Suddenly all the palaces were shaken By one reverberating clap of sound; A startled cry from every house in Rome Broke, and was lost amid the gathering roar; The great bell from the Capitol tolled out Above it, and from Mount Citorio The tocsin, silent for three hundred years, Pealed to the battle; and their voices rolled Into the thunder of the cannonade, And the sharp volleys of the musketeers. From every casement all along the street The heads of women leant; from every door Burgher and noble, priest and artisan, Rushed to the walls; and, with the first shot fired, A thrill of deathless passion ran through Rome. Around the base of Mount Janiculum Lies the stone girdle of the Roman wall; Porta Cavalleggieri to the right, And Porta San Pancrazio to the left, As you look downwards. Towards these gates advanced The French to the attack; but as they neared Porta Cavalleggieri their left wing Divided, and the outermost passed round The salient angle of the Vatican, Directed on the Gate Angelica; While, for a mile outside the city walls, The gardens of the Villa Pamphili And skirting vineyards of the road were held By Garibaldi. Here the first shock came, In the open ground. Down, with the bayonets He and his soldiers rushed upon the foe; And dark and terrible the war-clouds closed Over the desperate combat, hand to hand. The Tigers, as men named them in those days, Of Monte Video, and the African Lions were matched, and locked in furious strife. All in and out among the trodden vines, The cypress avenues and lovely lawns Of the Doria Gardens, did this first fight rage, Watched by the Romans from the heights above, With Garibaldi in the midst of it, And the white horse of Ugo galloping From one to another of the scattered troops, With orders from the General, till in midst Of the balls showering, horse and rider fell; The horse shot dead, but the bold messenger Unharmed,‚Äîwho still on foot across the field Made way, intent on serving such as lay Dying or wounded. Ebbed and flowed the tide Of victory; sometimes the ground was gained By the assailants, sometimes forced from them. But when at last the firing ceased, the French Were in retreat, and in our hands had left Nearly three hundred prisoners. In meantime The left attacking columns had made way, Sheltered by walls of villas, and by vines, Unnoticed almost to the very walls. But at the very moment when the sun First flashed upon their arms, the Roman fire Opened in front upon them, all along The terrace gardens of the Vatican; While in their rear, from Monte Mario Our cannon thundered; and Saint Angelo Let loose its lightnings on them all at once. They, overnumbered, baffled, and mowed down, Held their ground bravely, but at last retired, Disordered, to the covert of the vines, And sought a passage of retreat to join The right again. Thus on the left and right Were they repulsed. Then Oudinot, to lose No further time, brought forward all his troops Again to the first position, reinforced By fresh battalions. Then began again That Battle of the Garden:‚Äîfor four hours The mortal combat on whose issue hung Rome, raged with fury, and with equal chance. But Garibaldi in the midst was there, Erect on horseback, with his streaming hair, Bronze like a statue's, and the eyes that ruled The fortunes of the field. Was it those eyes That turned the trembling scales for us at last? For after desperate fighting we remained Masters; and on all sides the French fell back In full retreat, and leaving in our hands Their dead and wounded, and five hundred men Prisoners. Our victory was complete that day. The triumph and the joy of Rome that night All can remember who were found in her. The whole wide city was lit up with fire Of coloured lamps, and all her people streamed With songs and glorious music through her streets Or to the open churches, thanking God. But one alone was missing. Ugo came Not homewards with the fighters from the field, Nor was there any trace of him, and none Could tell where he had vanished. His dead horse Lay on the hill-side, but no Ugo lay Among the fallen; Garibaldi said That he had missed him after the first fight, And no one since had seen him. Fear and gloom Amid the glare of victory fell on me, And Garibaldi would not rest that night, But went on seeking for him. All night long, Through the rich moonlight that brought in the May, I wandered in a wild and ceaseless quest About the maze of those enchanted bowers And grassy glades of Villa Pamphili; Through the great avenues of evergreen Oaks, past the giant shadow of the pines, Out on to the white lawns and glittering flow Of waterfalls and fountains. Miles of green Stretched shadowy in the moonlight; marble forms Stood clear among them, bathed in glistening light. The flowers were folded, waiting for the burst Of the May morning. Upon every branch The nightingales were ringing out the night, Unheedful of the silent, busy forms That gathered round the dead for burial; Unheedful of torn boughs and trampled turf And blood-besprinkled beds of lilies, where Some lay in their last sleep. On every side Were strewn the signs of that day's ravages. I looked into the face of every one That lay there silent;‚ÄîI found friend and foe Rigid together under the bright moon, Among the bruised and dying cyclamens; And my heart trembled before every one; But still I found not Ugo; and as day Came on, I still pursued the fruitless search From here to Rome, and asked from every one Some news in vain: till in the afternoon, I found myself within Saint Pancras gate, And faint and wretched sank upon a bench Amid the stream of passers; and my head Dropped in my hands. I heard the many feet Go by me, in a dream, a dreary dream From which I could not wake; I heard the voice Of many a citizen sound close to me, With triumph in its tone;‚Äîwhen suddenly Among the steps and voices came one step Straight onward, and I knew it, and looked up; And there before me, the far-seeing eyes And the commanding form of Ugo passed, A little worn and weary, and with dust And tear of travel. But I could not speak; Only my face caught his face, and he stopped; And said amazed, ‚ÄòAntonio, what is this? Am I a ghost that you should look so scared? What has come to you?‚Äô But when I at last Had told my tale, and how not I alone, But Garibaldi, suffered in suspense, He took me also on his way to him At San Pietro in Montorio, And told me all the story as we went. For in the first fierce conflict, he was close To one of our own soldiers, mortally Wounded, and dying; whom within his arms He held, and listened to the last faint sobs Of his confession, when the bugle-call Sounded retreat, and in the varying tide Of the day's fortune our side was compelled To yield the ground. All fell away at once; But Ugo, kneeling, would not loose the clasp Of the cold fingers that still clung to his, Nor, while the death-film gathered o'er the eyes, Did the bright vision of his aspect pass Away above them. As the French rushed on, Furious, to take the long-contested spot, They found that one unarmed bright enemy, Whom they surrounded, and the dying man Breathed his last sigh upon the sheltering breast, Untouched of them; but roughly, in their rage, They handled Ugo, and were hardly held By their commander from destroying him. And he, their prisoner, marched with them that day For fifteen miles' retreat along the road; Nor did they treat him well, for no one gave Him food or drink, and all the night he lay Without a cloak or shelter, on the grass, Heavy with dew; but at midday was brought To the head-quarters, where the General Delivered to him letters, praying terms Of armistice, to the Triumvirate; And set him free to carry them to Rome; But bound him by a promise to return If these should be refused. So Ugo came On foot again to Rome, fatigued but safe, And to the heads of the Republic took His message. But they sent him back, because They would not grant the terms. Nevertheless An armistice on other grounds was made, And truce proclaimed between the camps, and each Retained its own position, far apart; And envoys between Rome and Paris passed; And hopes were entertained of happy peace Between the two Republics. Oudinot Sent Ugo Bassi back to us next day In token of good-will. And on our side, Mazzini, who could never yet believe That others were less noble than himself, Set unconditionally free the whole Of our five hundred prisoners, who had been Treated with every honour as our guests. And ere we parted from them, solemn prayers They joined in at Saint Peter's, offered up For them, and for ourselves, and for the whole Fraternity of Peoples; and by throngs Of the rejoicing people to the gates Were led, and were saluted in farewell. At that time it was often talked about In hot debate, that, on the First of May, If Garibaldi had not been withheld By the Triumvirate, he would have gone Straight in pursuit of the disordered foe, And would have hemmed them in in their retreat, And have destroyed them, cut off from the sea; And Rome would have been saved. I cannot tell: Wisdom is easy after the event. Ten thousand, ay, ten million, eyes are sharp As needles, to prick holes in deeds performed, For the one eye of eagle that can mark The moment's action, and strike straight at it. The military hospitals, for those Who had been wounded, whether friend or foe, Were tended by the noblest hands in Rome. And Ugo daily ministered in them; I being under him:‚Äîand I, likewise, Was now appointed to a special post Of service with the ambulance, in case Of further fighting. On one eve I went, Bearing a message from the hospital To the head-quarters of the cavalry On Mount Janiculum; and there I found Ugo with Garibaldi. All the doors Of the great Convent were set open wide, And in the cloisters were the horses ranged; And the wild soldiers filled the rambling courts, And noisily pursued their sports around The sacred Temple of the Cross. But out Upon the quiet terrace of the church, Red in the sunset, walked those two apart; All Rome beneath theml and beyond it far, The plain of flooded light up to the bound Of the crimson hills; and overhead a sky That glowed with every glory of the rose, And held the earth within it, as it were, All glorious together. Ugo said: ‚ÄòThis hill is sacred that we stand upon, For its Saint's sake. Can we but think of him?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòI am no priest; And do not overmuch admire the Saints.‚Äô And Ugo spoke again: ‚ÄòI can but think Of one who was most happy, standing here. This is his City; his Basilica Lies at our feet; and all the prayers of the world Draw thither in a ceaseless pilgrimage; And whoso once stands in it cannot loose Its shadow from his soul. Did he not here Conquer this city, which had conquered earth, To be his Master's? Is there any place Around us, but he first did consecrate To the new kingdom? One may sweep away His throne; but cannot sweep the spirit of him From the air of Rome:‚Äîbut what was this to him Here? Was there anything in earth or heaven That could come nigh him on this last steep height. But the one joy too great for heart to bear,‚Äî But the One Face so soon to see again?‚Äô They turned into the church, and I with them; The great and gloomy church was dark and cold; The pictures of the Passion on the walls Made one feel glad that one was not a Saint. The altar-piece of Peter crucified Was happily but little to be seen. But Garibaldi walked with Ugo still, Conversing, up and down the shadowy aisles, Untroubled, until Ugo drew him close To the high altar, and at foot of it Showed him a bare flat stone, and said to him: ‚ÄòHere let thy feet fall softly. Dost thou know Whose grave this is, without a cross or name?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòI do not know Of any grave. Perhaps another Saint?‚Äô ‚ÄòNay,‚Äô answered Ugo, ‚Äònot of priests and popes;‚Äî They who delivered her over to her doom For the price of fifty thousand golden crowns: But of the number of the innocent souls,‚Äî Those that were slain, whom God beholds in heaven, Under the altar crying still to Him, And has not sent an answer yet to earth. Yet shall this stone not keep His ears from her Who lies beneath it for two hundred years, The Roman Beatrice,‚Äîburied here Without a priest, or prayer, and left alone In death. What more could any do for her? The first soft touch that ever came to her Was here, where hands, that could not spare nor save Strewed her with violets from head to foot, And laid the heavy stone to keep her safe From any harm of hateful human hand. ‚ÄòIt seems to me, if any one to-day Could lift it up, that we should see her there, Without a shadow of change from then till now. She is lying there with that same face we know; The young limbs lovely, and the child's bright head Have not had time to lose their deep delight, Lying where none can tear them from their rest. The sweet lips keep their last look infantile; The young and sleepless eyes are shut at last; The untwisted golden hair falls over her; The soft hands are folded like a child's that lies Beside its mother; you can hardly see Whether she breathes or not, she lies so still. If there be any violent bruise or streak, The shadow of the violets smooths it down. ‚ÄòIf so, indeed, she stay beneath our feet,‚Äî And I myself can almost feel her peace Around me in the still and sacred air,‚Äî It were but little of a miracle, For the miracle that kept the flower of her soul Alone in the unspeakable abyss, Stronger than adamant, softer than the spring, Serene and shining, and ineffable, A lily steeped in crimson by the rush Of the wings of dawn, star-clear within itself, Trembling with tenderness to every touch, So that her lips smiled once before she died, With consolation to the hearts that broke Only with looking on her,‚Äîsmiled, and said, ‚ÄúLet me not grieve you;‚Äîbut thank God for me That now my life is over.‚Äù‚Äô... Now arrived At Rome the news that sounded like a knell,‚Äî Bologna fallen:‚Äîafter a defence Heroic to the last, but of despair, She was delivered up into the hands Of General Gorzhowski, known from all The other Austrian generals of that day By a pre-eminence of evil fame. And such tales came to us as made the blood Boil in our veins, of shameful violence done, Rapine and devastation, fire and sword, And brutal insolence of force that flung Mocking and shame at those it trampled on. And unavailing passion rent the heart Of Rome; but Ugo's heart was rent with loss Of his own city; and he could not rest For thinking of her; and his eyes began To take a sadder shadow than their wont. While there was truce between the French and us, The army of the king of Naples moved Within our borders, and possessed themselves Of all the open country, and encamped In fortified Velletri, whence they held A post of menace for us from the South. Therefore the Roman army was sent forth Against them. Garibaldi led the way, With Ugo Bassi riding by his side, His officer of ordonnance; (for when His horse was shot, had Garibaldi given Another to him). But I had besought Of Ugo Bassi, and almost with tears, That he would take me with him; for I said, ‚ÄòO Master, it was terrible, that day When none could find thee; and thou goest now Into fresh perils, and who knows what fate?‚Äô But he made answer, ‚ÄòNone may go with us, But such as are accustomed to the march. God's hand is over thee and me alike, Whether we go or stay: but stay thou here, And tend my sick for me while I am gone.‚Äô And they through many toils and dangers passed Up to Velletri; and a battle there Was fought, and all the army of the king Was beaten back, and fled; and they retook Velletri; and returned in triumph home, And safe; and on the Twenty fourth of May Re-entered Rome amid wild cries of joy. But Ugo had been wounded in the foot, Though slightly, galloping across the line Of the enemy's fire, to hurry up the troops Commanded by Manara to the front. Nearly were articles of peace, and terms Of honourable concord, signed between Lesseps, the Envoy, and the Triumvirs; When counter-orders came to Oudinot, Who suddenly, upon the First of June Broke off negotiations, and thus wrote: ‚ÄòMy orders will admit of no delay. I am to enter Rome;‚Äîwhether by force Or by free-will, it is for you to choose. We give you till the morning of the Fourth;‚Äî Within that time surrender if you will;‚Äî If not, I take it by assault at once.‚Äô Hardly was any answer deigned to this Last summons; but the Romans, young and old, Flocked to the walls and batteries, and worked With a redoubled spirit. And in front Ever was Ciceruacchio, with the band Of workmen volunteers, who followed him As pioneers and sappers; and the strong Arms, and the deep and ever-mirthful voice Of that one man alone did work enough In any day for six days' common hire. The Fourth was Monday: and upon the night Of the Second, many of us said, We will Rest on the morrow, and rejoice once more. After this Sabbath shall we sleep again? But this was not to be: for on the night Between the Second and the Third, when we, Relying on our adversary's word, Believed we had another day to spare, The army of the French moved silently From its position, and advanced on us, And through the darkness reached our outer works; And glided silently between the lines Of myrtle hedges that there mark the way, And came upon our sentinel, who cried ‚ÄòWho goes there?‚Äô and the answer was returned, ‚ÄòViva l'Italia!‚Äô‚Äîso the first passed in Without alarm; and with a poniard-thrust The sentinel lay quiet at his post. And following them, the column rushed inside, Killing and taking prisoners on their way The unprepared and scattered men-at-arms: And swiftly, silently, and suddenly Taking possession thus of all our posts Outside the walls;‚Äîthe Villa Pamphili, The Villas Valentini, Corsini. Only remained the one nearest the gates, Villa Vascello. While, at the same time, Their left had marched on Monte Mario, And also in the darkness had surprised The unsuspecting guards; and seized the works Of the defence, the heights that overlooked The city, and had turned them on ourselves. Such of the guards as were not overpowered, Rushed to the gate of San Pancrazio, crying, ‚ÄòTo arms! To arms!‚Äô and from the ramparts there The cannon opened fire upon the posts Carried by the besiegers; and the French Close by poured in a furious fusillade. And at the sound the drums began to beat, And with a gathering clang the bells joined in.‚Äî In the uncertain glimmer of the dawn Was Rome awaked to find her outposts won By treachery. [The account of the taking of Rome by assault and bombardment, and its heroic defence, can be found in several other books. It was therefore left to the last by the Author, who is now overtaken by illness, and forced to relinquish her work.] July 2nd. Then Garibaldi gathered all his troops Around him, in Saint Peter's Place, and said: ‚ÄòMy place is here no longer. Rome has fallen. She has forbidden us to strike again For her defence. I will not stay to see The foreign army pass along her streets Victorious. Still, against the foreigner Shall never struggle cease in Italy, While I can live for her. I go to bear Her last resistance through the provinces, God helping us alone. Whoever wills To follow me, I will receive to-day. Nothing I ask from them to make them mine. But love for Italy and faith in her. They will have neither pay nor rest with me; But bread and water,‚Äîif we have the chance To find so much. I cannot promise them Even a grave; nothing is sure but death. Whoever is not satisfied with this, Had better come no further. Every step Will be a step towards death, when once the gates Of Rome have closed behind us. Who will come?‚Äî Meet me at six o'clock this evening, here.‚Äô These are the words that Garibaldi wrote Long afterwards, remembering this day: ‚ÄòFour thousand men on foot, nine hundred horse Ranged themselves round me. And the first who came To join themselves to me, that hour, were these;‚Äî Anita, Ciceruacchio and his sons, And the saint, Ugo Bassi, who aspired To martyrdom. The rest in order came. Towards evening, by the gate of Tivoli, I quitted Rome. My heart was sad as death.‚Äô And the same hour the French came into Rome. VI July, 1849. And now, when Ugo Bassi would depart With Garibaldi, I again besought That he would take me with himl and he said, ‚ÄòI will not say thee Nay this time. Who wills, May follow now. Come; thou art one of us; There will not be too many on this march.‚Äô So with the rest I went, carrying with me The musket that was given me, when I took My turn upon the walls of Rome. We left By different gates, having for meeting-place A spot about four miles outside the walls. I by the gate of Saint Sebastian passed Along the Appian Way. The night was warm; The moonlight and the shadows of the tombs Chequered the ground in silver and in black; The yellow berries of the ivy hung, Whitened with dust, above the roadside walls. After two miles we halted by the church, Where Peter met our Lord upon the road, And said to him, ‚ÄòQuo vadis, Domine?‚Äô And there we waited for another band. Behind us still we heard, or seemed to hear, The stir of Rome, though now, for the first time For many months, no guns disturbed the night: Behind us rose the shadow of the hills. ‚ÄîWe felt the gates were passed, and never more Should any one of us re-enter Rome. Here were we joined by others; and by trains Of ammunition, strings of loaded mules, And waggons; and the companies were formed In order: Ugo Bassi was with us. It was near midnight when the word arrived To start afresh. The moon was at the full, So that there was no need of other light. There in the moonlight, in the midst of us, When all of us were ready, he stood out, And said, ‚ÄòWill any now go back to Rome? The way is plain; the gates are open still; There is yet time.‚Äô But no one answered him. And all of us stood still, regarding him: For as he stood, a look came over him, Which, as we gazed, seemed to us that he saw Another coming; and some other eyes Were meeting his; and slow and sure the feet Unsandalled drew towards him, and there came The rustling of a garment white and long Approaching‚Äîand the two were face to face; And Ugo's voice was passionately near. ‚ÄòO Lord, the same this night that long ago, Here in the moonlight, in the midnight came! So that Thy very footprint still is left Upon the stones; and we, too, stand and pass On the same dusty road between the tombs, On to an end which yet we cannot see, But in Thy service, and at Thy command; We do not fear to meet Thy face to-night Without its smile! Thou standest in our midst, And all our hearts are comforted and calm. Keep us Thine own;‚Äîand keep us in the way Thou first hast trodden:‚Äîwe are going now Whither we know not; only go with us! Thou wilt not set Thy face to Rome to-night, But out into the wilderness with us. Be Thou beside us, and in all our need Suffer us not to fall away from Thee. And if at any hour, at any pass Of our extremity, our hearts should fail, And the betrayal tremble to our lips, Turn on us Thy reproachful eyes again,‚Äî Whose least sad look can strike the falsehood back, Sharper than many swords; whose least low word Sets the face steadfast through the thundering storm; Whose least light touch can smooth the bars of fire Into a bed of roses,‚Äîlook on us! O Lord, stay with us, and we ask no more!‚Äô Then to the left we turned; and made our way Across the fields and vineyards, and by lanes, To join the others, who had come from Rome By Porta San Giovanni. The night air, Laden with jasmine and magnolia scents, Had yet a sulphurous odour above all, Though clear; and peace seemed not on all the earth. About a mile from the Tiburian road, Southwards, we halted, having met and joined The others; and the whole five thousand thence Set off together, led through the by-ways By Ciceruacchio; for it was the aim Of Garibaldi to avoid the road, Seeing three armies were about our way, To track, and seize, and crush us. But he said: ‚ÄòWe may escape them all, if we but wind Among them, by the paths they least suspect; And once amidst the mountains, numbers count For little.‚Äô So we stole across the plain. Full dark was Garibaldi's face that night; And mounted close beside him went his wife, Anita, with her glory of dark eyes That spoke for her, and held his heart in hers; The beautiful Flower of the New World that he Had gathered in a garden not his own; Who had lost the world, and lost her soul for love, And followed him through flood, and field, and fire, And borne him children, and had been to him The angel in the battle and the storm; And now was nigh to bearing her fourth child, Having left her little children safe in charge, When she came into Rome to share the siege. Her face was sadder than I yet had seen. And close by them went Ugo, at the word Of Garibaldi; for he said, ‚ÄòThy place Be ever nearest me. We have not known Each other long; and little have we had Of joy together‚Äîlet us have to-day. After, who knows how long our life may last? I would not lose one hour, away from thee.‚Äô I followed some way after, with the rear. Next morning we arrived at Tivoli, And rested there through the day's heat. The day Of cloudless splendour yet remains with me; The blossom-spray of myrtle burst and foamed All round us, like the silver foam and spray Of dazzling waters sliding from the heights. The gardens of that Paradise on Earth Were made for such as had not known a care: But among us, the sick and restless awe Was brooding, of the future and the past; We, fugitives between three armies loosed Upon us, soldiers of a flag gone down, Digging our own graves where we should lie low With our dead hopes, and knowing that our fate Had severed us already from our lives. At close of day we passed from Tivoli To Monticelli;‚Äîthere abode the night: And still across the plain we went next day, By rough and narrow roads; and as the day Sank, through a little village, thick in vines, We laboured, called Mentana; and in front Beheld the great hill break out of the plain, Monte Rotondo; we were glad when we Reached it, and camped around it for the night. Thence for a little way we followed on The Via Salaria, the old Roman road That leads one to Rieti; then struck off To left across the country, leaving all Safe roads and smooth; and after four days' toil, Over a wilderness of mountain lands, The wild untrodden heart of Italy, Arrived at Terni, having all our store Of baggage and of ammunition safe. Meanwhile the troops of Naples, France, and Spain, By every straight road leading out of Rome Had been pursuing us, but found us not. At Terni, in the shelter of the hills, Two days we stayed: and there nine hundred men, Part of the legion of America, Joined company with us. The second night We set off on our wanderings again. We took the road five miles below the Falls; We could not see them for the woods between, But to our ears the far-off thunder still Came down the valley; and at one wild turn, The deep sound drew me, and I looked behind, And all at once, unutterably clear, Far off I saw a liquid precipice Hang high in heaven above the dark-green hills‚Äî Glorious and awful. Passing under cliffs Of limestone, with great caverns in their sides, We rested at San Gemini, and thence, A rugged road crossing the mountain ridge, Brought us to Todi;‚Äîthere we stayed some days Here were we met by secret embassies From Tuscany, who prayed of us to come Into their midst, they being ripe, they said, For a fresh rising, and the people all Maddened with indignation as they saw The insolent Croats in their City of Flowers Go masters;‚Äîbut the garrisons were weak, And might be overpowered by a surprise. So Garibaldi shifted course, and made Thither, in hope of fortune's favouring him. Both of the high-roads into Tuscany The Austrians held; the Neapolitans Were close behind us; and the French had reached And occupied Viterbo on the left. The gates of the Legations, too, were closed By Wimpffen and Gorzhowski, who had marched To guard the Apennines:‚Äîon every side The fatal ring of fire encircled us. But Garibaldi broke through it. He sent Light troops of horse below the very walls Of hostile garrisons on either side, Foligno and Viterbo, to draw off Hither and thither the pursuing hosts; While part to northward crossed the Tiber near Thrasimene; and he himself remained At Todi, waiting till they should converge Towards Cetona, where they should await Himself; and then struck off for the same point. We left behind at Todi all we had Superfluous, horses, waggons, heavy guns, And ammunition, and set out again To our adventure, little left to lose. A hilly bridle-road for eighteen miles Led us all day by lonely ups and downs; Without a sound save the innumerable Streams of the mountains, falling either side Towards the rivers. Early in the day We crossed the Tiber, and from hour to hour Forded the waters in their summer beds. But in the afternoon we found a bridge Across a greater river, and again Another river with another bridge Met us, and flashing down the valley rolled To meet the first; but we passed farther on To Orvieto; and at sunset saw The city rise before us, walled, and set Upon the last rock of the long sheer range Volcanic, stretching straight across the plain In vertical escarpments, lava-black. And separated, at the end of all, An island at a promontory's point, The bare steep circuit, with its citadel, Eight hundred feet above the washing waves Of Paglia round its base, and crowded up With roofs and turrets to its midmost height, Where its Crown Jewel, its Duomo, stood, Bearing aloft its golden western front High in the sunset over all the land. But the next day alarm was raised, the French Were marching from Viterbo, and in haste We left; but from the heights we saw the road Across the plain to southward hid in clouds Of dust, and through the clouds the blueish glint Of the advancing columns. Half an hour After we quitted Orvieto, they Were in it. This day by the road we went, A march of fifteen miles. At first, down hill Until we crossed the rivers; then the way Ascended to La Croce. All the land Was lovely: far and clear around us lay The olive-softened hills of Tuscany, One fresh and fertile garden every side; Perpetual quick blue rivers flowed and sang Down the green valleys, meeting now and then In cool delicious beds of foaming white; The violet gladiolus in the corn Drooped with its glory; and the way-side rose Blossomed in every fragile crimson change; The yellow garland-flower, the melilot, Hung its trails over us from bush and brake As though we had been conquerors. As we rose Higher, we skirted forests of the oak, And glades of grass and fern. But we were tired, And hungered, and footsore; and felt our foes Beforehand with us whither we might turn, And were uncertain whether we might meet Our comrades, or what fate the day might bring; And would have rather seen some homely place Of rest, and refuge, and security, Than any fairest landscape upon earth. That night we reached Ficulle: and next day On the same road went forward without check. By evening we had mounted to a ridge Parting the torrents to the east and west, And marched along its summit till we reached Citt√† della Pieve, which we made Our next night s halting-place. From this we left The road, and marched all day across a wild And solitary country to the west. At first through forests; then the ground became More broken and more barren,‚Äîtracts of moor, Brushwood of myrtle, heath, and arbutus, With here and there a solitary pine; And the wild deer fled from us, and wild birds Flew off in flocks; but we passed on, until The moorland gave its moss and turf alone Unto our feet, and grassy hills arose On every side of us, in strange great shapes, As though they had been fashioned by the hands Of giants; and a phantom wind arose, And moaned through them at evening; and we wound Through narrowing defiles, where on either hand The walls were hollowed into sepulchres, Line above line, with awful ancient doors For dwellers taller than the race of men, All desolate and silent, with large rows Of letters, carved in some unknown dead tongue Still speaking to us‚Äîa green place of tombs; Nor trace of any city, but of one Great Nation of the Dead: and farther on The valley opened out upon a sea Of swelling hillocks, and among them rose Green hills like pyramids, and every one Hollowed in chambers and in labyrinths, Tomb after tomb; and all the turf was fine, And flocks of sheep amid the solitudes Were grazing, and black birds among them walked. At evening, turning past a higher range, We saw in sudden light, without a cloud, A great black mountain with torn peaks stand up Alone against us for four thousand feet; And climbed up to Cetona, with white walls Half-hid in olives, nestling at its base. The other companies had here arrived In the day's course, and occupied the fort, The Austrians having fled at their approach. Here Garibaldi rested for a day; And reconnoitred, but without success, Toward Siena. Here the roll was called Of all who still were following. But alas! Already had our number fallen off Almost by half: many had lagged behind, Ill, or exhausted; many had given up A hopeless quest, and sought security; And some, dishonour to a noble cause, Had cast off all restraint, and strayed away For pillage and for rapine. When we left Cetona, we were but three thousand men. Through the rich ancient heart of Tuscany, Three days our course continued, still pursued Closely; at Monte Pulciano first We halted; at Foiano the next day; And at Castiglione on the third. And still advancing, saw with hope the walls Of old Arezzo, stretching up the hill. There we expected welcome; but we found The gates were closed against us, and the towers Threatened us; for the Austrian garrison Had overawed the people, and the troops Of the Archduke were close upon the town. The Austrians were around us all next day, And kept us from the roads; we had to pass By rugged devious tracks along the hills, And so arrived, hemmed in on every side, Upon the summit of a mount, where stands Citerna. Here we had no breathing-time: On every side of us the enemy Were closing in. We raised a false alarm, By feint of marching northward; and when night Closed in upon us, Garibaldi bade We should depart in silence to the east. We raised our camp in fear and cautiousness; And all night long we toiled by rocky paths And perilous, so narrow that we scarce Singly could pass along them; it was dark; We hardly thought that we should live to see Another day's light;‚Äîbut at dawn we came, Still living, to the little frontier town, San Giustino; but we might not rest. Deeper and deeper, up into the heart Of the wild Apennines, we still pressed on, Through paths known only to the muleteer And goatherd; we were well-nigh spent with thirst, And hunger, and fatigue; the fierce sun beat Upon the burning rocks; and ever up And up we went; and many vultures too Were following us; and some lay down and died. But all whose strength would hold, still dragged them-selves On, not to let the terrible wilderness Serve for their sepulchre; for all among The cliffs, we saw the caverns of the bears; And through the night wild fox and tiger-cat Streamed from the savage ledges out of reach: And well we knew no kindly foot should come That way again, nor any bones of ours Be found of friends, and buried by the way: Yes, I am glad that I did not die there! But Garibaldi's face was still as one's That looks upon a sunset, and the light Streams back into his eyes. And Ugo's wore The utter peace of one whose life is hid In God's own hand. And through the day's fatigue, Those two alike apparelled still went on Foremost, and side by side. And I, being sure Of foot, and mountain-bred, fared easier Amid the perils of the way than most; And when the track was lost, and down below The precipice fell off to the abyss, And round a jutting shoulder there appeared No footing, and it was more difficult To turn than to go on; then Ugo called Me to the front, and I went on with them First, to make clear a passage for the rest; And all the day I went in front with them, And helped across the straitest of the pass To bear the litter where Anita lay, Who now could fare no further upon foot. And Garibaldi spoke to me, and once Commended me, nor did I part all day Out of the sight of those two friends and chiefs; But henceforth stayed beside them, and the way Seemed not so terrible when they were near. And though I know that Garibaldi's face, And splendour of eyes, and tawny mane of hair Are yet not to be matched in all the world, I though the other, taller and more spare, With the fatigue beginning to tell now Upon the clear and spiritual face, And the dark hollows underneath the eyes, Not the less beautiful: and often mused On the strange fate that had elected me To be so near to heroes, and to share Such noble things, and in their hour of need To be obedient to them, and to serve Him whom I loved the best of all the world. At sunset, after twenty-four hours' march, We reached the extreme summit of the chain Of Apennine; and knew that here at least We were secure a little while. So then We lit the camp-fires, staying for the night. But little food was there, and little sleep On the bare rock that night for any of us. And I remember still the hour that came Before the sunrise, in that mountain hold, As the next day drew on; and all around, The crowning peaks grew visible in air,‚Äî Range upon range of solemn shapes that wore All the live hues of the anemone, Crimson, and purple, and deep dawning blues; And morning-mist below them; and above, The growing golden spaces of the light. And then the silent burst of sunrise, with The long, low violet shadows swept across From mountain unto mountain; and at once, From three far separate crags I saw the rise Of three great hovering eagles, each alone, Each in his kingdom of another day. But oh! the freshness of that kindling dawn In that untrodden fastness; and the breath Of the first breeze that streamed from height to height! All youth was in it, and the coming tale Of the long summer's day; a day it was That one might wake to, saying, ‚ÄòIf we live Till evening, we shall not have failed of bliss.‚Äô Some mystery of joy in every hour Lying folded, as the rose-leaves in the rose. But we who hailed that dawning, knew the day Should be but one day's march the nearer death; And stiff and sleepless, famished and footsore, Haggard and torn, like spectres of ourselves, Lifted our aching limbs to bear us on; Knowing that ere another night came round, They might ache worse, with wounds, or chains, or stripes; And hardly knowing if we wished to live. And as the curling mists began to move Around the narrow passes of the hills, We watched their wavering with uneasy eyes, And thought we saw the columns of the foe Wind through the gateways of our last retreat; And started at each shadow of the clouds. Descending by the rugged eastern side, We, on the twenty-eighth of July, reached San Angelo in Vado; but could find No resting-place; and nearly were surprised, Leaving the town:‚Äîthe Austrians had come up With our rear-guard, and in a desperate fight, These forced a passage through the enemy, And came up to rejoin us, by steep paths The others could not follow. On we went, Breathlessly, daring not to look behind. And now, reduced to these extremities, We, under Garibaldi, made our course For San Marino, in whose territory, As a Republic yet inviolate, He purposed to find refuge for all those Whose strength and courage might not bear them on Through new and unknown perils: while himself Pushed on to Venice with such few as still Might follow and be faithful. But the hearts Of most had failed already, and their strength Was yet at lower ebb; all hope was lost; Nothing was left them, perishing among The rocks and forests of the wilderness. Not even hope of glory, nor the wild Excitement of the battle, nor the gain Of falling in fair field to leave a name Our country should keep honoured. We had done Our utmost, and had failed; the rest had failed Before us. But, myself, I did not care, So long as life kept in me, what should come, While still my place was at my master's side. That was enough; together we went on, Sharing the peril and the pain alike, To our destruction, knowing not what hour Our fate should meet us; and I thought at least, We should not be divided in our death. Arduous and nigh impassable we found The way to San Marino; unknown paths, Dense forests, rushing torrents, deep ravines And not alone the Austrians in our rear, Descending from the Tuscan Apennines, But pressing up on either side of us, The armies from Romagna. All the night, And all the day, we marched, but many fell Dead on the way. At evening we arrived At Macerata Feltria. In what place Soever we found shelter, joyfully The people and the peasants succoured us, And gave us of their best. And there as we Rested, and in the shadow of the trees Had Garibaldi laid Anita down, Wrapt in his cloak, a woman came to us, Tall, and of serious aspect and pale face, And brought us in abundance bread and wine, And served us with untired solicitude. But she looked pityingly, with softened eyes, Upon Anita‚Äîwho lay wearily With hollow cheeks, and moaning in her sleep‚Äî And said to Garibaldi, ‚ÄòGeneral, Let her not fall alive into their hands!‚Äô But he smiled mournfully, and said, ‚ÄòNo fear! I keep a dagger for her next my heart; And a last pistol-charge.‚Äô And she went on, ‚ÄòThey are near, General! They are all around: I know not if there be between us yet An hour's march: as you see there the leaves In the wood rustling, through them there may be The white coats coming.‚Äô Garibaldi said, ‚ÄòWe have come here through many straits, and now, God helping me, I shall yet give the slip To General Gorzhowski‚Äî‚Äô here he paused; For at the name, her face grew quivering-white, And the deep passion burst forth in her voice: ‚ÄòGorzhowski! Can a Christian speak his name, And not add to it every curse in hell? Do not we dwellers in Romagna know Of him and his too well? Look round, and see The heaps of ashes where our homes have stood. See, if you will, but do not think to hear, For men and women utter not such things As they have known in this unhappy land.‚Äî Have you seen Monna Lucia as you passed, She who looks down upon her empty arms Rocked on her bosom, where a month ago Her babe lay smiling as the Austrians broke In, and demanded at the bayonet's point Her husband who was hidden? There is one Close by, indoors, and her you will not see, For never will she lift her head, nor speak, Nor come out of the dark; the loveliest girl Of all our village, Angela, the one With hair like Guido's saints, and once she smiled. She was betrothed, it was her wedding-day Two months ago,‚Äîwhy is she not a bride? That was the day Gorzhowski's troops were here. What is the last news from Bologna? ah! Can I not tell you that? Who knows so well? I can bring to you one for testimony, My son, my child, a boy of twelve years old. In the last rising of the city, he Was in the streets, too young to carry arms; But he was captured with the tricolor Held in his hand, when half the rest were slain. What is Gorzhowski's mercy? He was spared His life, he said, by favour; he came home To me, his mother, from the Austrian rods, And ah! if I could show you, General;‚Äî (God save you, for you would have saved us too!) I am a woman‚Äîwoman's lips may fail At such a telling‚Äîbut this woman's hand, God let it wither in the flames of hell, If aught it fail for pity or for prayers, When once it has the knife in the Austrian flesh.‚Äô We struggled onwards without road or guide, And next day we had well-nigh lost ourselves In the deep woods; and coming to a pass, Found that the Austrians had already seized The heights above; and nearly were cut off. But at the day's end, such as still were left Had reached Pietra Rubbia; and next day, Through the same perils held on out of breath, Until at last we set our feet upon The rock of San Marino, and might rest. And there the people welcomed us with joy, As men who had been saved out of a wreck; (Only twelve hundred of us being left). But the next day we hardly were awake, Before a summons to the city came From General Gorzhowski, which proclaimed That the Republic, should it harbour us Beyond the morrow, should be entered by The Austrian armies marching from each side; (Ten thousand men having already held The passes leading from it, to close up All way for our escape). And furthermore, A messenger to Garibaldi came, With these proposals for himself and us: That all our arms should be laid down at once, And pardon should be granted us; that we Under safe-conduct should be guarded home; And he himself, secure from further harm, Have passage given him to America. But Garibaldi tore the paper up; And said, ‚ÄòI make no terms for my own life With him whose heel is down on Italy. There is no answer. But I will not bring Ruin and rapine on this peaceful town, That gives us welcome worthy of her boast Of freedom immemorial. But alas, There are no rights left now to be maintained, Nor any law of nations or of God; And the thousands of the tramping feet may march Straight on, and sparing not, for all is theirs.‚Äô Then he assembled all of us: and said, ‚ÄòFriends, we have done a great thing, reaching here, And God has helped us; we are safe to-night; Inviolate in this spot, which kings have spared So long, but will not spare another day If we remain in it. Now go your ways:‚Äî And many of us shall not meet again; For I go hence to-morrow with my sword; Since Venice yet holds out, and we by sea May reach her yet, though but by miracle. But whoso willeth may lay down his arms, And have safe-conduct from the Austrian hence; And none of you henceforth is bound to me,‚Äî Ye have done well,‚Äînow take your chance of life: Yet some of you, I know, will leave me not. Sleep in this hospitable town to-night, For it may be the last night ye will have For sleeping; take your rest, and eat and drink; Speak among friends free words of kindliness; Cast not by any sweet face; if ye can, Sing and be merry; and to-morrow morn, Let him who feels that he can easily Lie down with death as if it were a bride, And cares not now to live when all is lost, Meet me again‚Äîand here: but let him know He will not have to-morrow's choice come twice. For whoso goeth forth of here with me Will leave behind him his last chance of life. Yea, every chance save one, that he may die Free in Italian freedom, ere it dies, The freedom that has only lived a year And that is but a chance‚Äîa slender one.‚Äô And the next day, at the appointed hour I, at the place appointed, found myself One of three hundred, who were all that now Remained with us. And so we took our leave Of San Marino; and set forth again On a more desperate errand than before. Nine hundred of our comrades stayed behind; Having consented to lay down their arms Under a promise from Gorzhowski's hand They should go free. But they did not gain much By their surrender; for upon the road He stopped them, and divided them; and half He to the prisons sent of evil fame Of Mantua; and upon the rest bestowed The bastinado, ninety strokes apiece. And ere we passed from San Marino, we Had seen the proclamation issued forth To every town and hamlet of the land, By General Gorzhowski, in these terms: ‚ÄòWhoever shall from this time forth receive The outlaw Garibaldi, or his wife, Or his banditti, some three hundred men, Or any of their number,‚Äîor shall give Them shelter, or shall furnish them with food, Or fire, or water, or shall succour them, Or guide them, shall be counted one with them, And share with them the penalty of death. And death shall further be the penalty For any one, who, knowing where they hide, Shall not detain them and deliver them Up to the military law at once. And any place or village where they pass Shall be included in the penalty, If within space of twenty-four hours thence They be not lodged within our hands. Take note Of every stranger that shall come your way. The diabolical, ferocious face Of Garibaldi, no one can mistake; The woman, though disguised, may soon be known, Being great with child, and close upon the hour; The men are armed as brigands, and are all Well-nigh barefooted, and in rags by now. And every one who gives a rebel up, Alive or dead, but most of all alive, Shall have reward: but he who has the luck To capture Garibaldi, though he be A rebel and an outlaw too, himself, Shall have free pardon, and a fortune too, Worthy of the Imperial treasury.‚Äô Forward we went all day in gloom and dread For Garibaldi's eyes had grown so dark, And his mouth set so stern, I did not dare To look upon him; and I felt the days Were drawing to some terrible great close. But still I had the comfort close at hand, And the way was not dark to me; for still I was with Ugo, both upon one march, Who, free from any earthly bond or care, In the red raiment of the battle-field, Went onward ever in a glorious peace, As though the bitterness of death were passed, Or rather could not come to him. And I, Looking on him whom I had loved so long, Saw, standing in the sunset, as it were, The angel of that Ugo who had stood In the monk's habit side by side with me, Serving the sick in the dark house at Rome. And that night in the open we encamped, To the sea-coast advancing. It was dark; More than one fire we did not dare to light; And near it Garibaldi and his wife, And Ciceruacchio and his two sons sat, With Ugo and some others, through the night. But Ugo drew a poem from his breast, Which he was writing: all the way from Rome This work had come with him; and many times When others were asleep, he sat and wrote; And now, this night I watched him write again, Fast, and with knitted brows, as though his heart Were set to finish it. The book was called ‚ÄòLa Croce Vincitrice‚Äô (being a tale Of those who first for Christ had died in Rome, And how, at last subdued, an Emperor Had laid his Empire at the Cross's foot). I never saw the poem‚Äîand indeed, I could not well have read it,‚Äîbut I saw The face of Ugo, when his feet were set Upon the way of doom. The wakeful eyes Of Garibaldi strained into the dark; And still he listened, and would take no rest. And by the watchfire that night once he broke The gloomy silence, saying: ‚ÄòFriend, good-night! What shall to-morrow bring us? Shall we reach Venice together? Nay, I think it not. For we have come to our last hope, and that Is failing us, to die amongst our own. What matters? What is left us now to do, Since this year's Italy was but a dream, And it is over, but to vanish too? We could not save her,‚Äîshould we save ourselves? Nay, it were well for us if but our blood Might drop into her furrows, and sink down, And through the winter lie among the seeds, And we be no more heard of evermore: For I know surely that though we be dead, Though all this generation pass away, Out of this soil the flower shall spring at last, Of the starry whiteness, and the crimson heart, And the green leaves spreading‚ÄîYea, the Flower of the World, Poets have dreamed of‚Äîbut upon our graves.‚Äô And Ugo answered, with the flickering fire Lighting the liquid eyes up underneath: ‚ÄòYea, Greatest, on our graves, but not on thine. Thine eyes shall see it. They have got no look Of yearning after a dream unfulfilled; But rather that magnetic joy which draws Men to partake of it, saying, ‚ÄúWe desire, And falter, and come short; lo, here is one In whom the strength is one with the desire.‚Äù Though now thou comest to that straitest pass Wherein availeth thee not strength, nor joy, And thou must suffer, and not thou alone. But thou shalt come forth from it, though thou leave Thy heart's desire there, and thy bloom of life, And God shall go with thee through the dark days That are coming, that are come. And thou shalt stand, Some day far hence, after long tale of years, Alone, alone, but Garibaldi still, In the face of all the world; and at thy side, Like a golden lily after the night's rain Bursting its sheath in the sunrise, all uprisen, Italy, Italy, with the eyes of fire! Laying her hand in thine, and turned to thee, And saying, ‚ÄúMy Saviour! can I give thee nought?‚Äù And then thy heart will turn back to this day, This day of utter desolate despair, When we were driven between the shore and sea, And the hounds of all the Empire loose on us,‚Äî And yet we were together; and the heart Of thy child's mother lying close to thine: And thou wilt say in the glory to thyself, ‚ÄúGive me that day back‚Äîbut it cannot be.‚Äù Yet fear not, Garibaldi, for thy heart Is stronger than all grief, or death, or time.‚Äô But then Anita sprang up passionately:‚Äî ‚ÄòHave we to die so soon? I cannot die Till I have seen my children once again! They are across the mountains and the sea, They are asking when their mother will come back. How can a mother die, with her little ones Calling her back to them and wanting her? O Christ, Who wast born of Mary, hearken me For Thy mother's sake, and pity me now at least! O Mary, save me! Let me suffer pain, Yea, any labour, any agony, So I but living to my children come! Let the way be as long and perilous As ever any pilgrim had to tread, Before his sins were loosened, and he sank Dead on the last steps of Thy sanctuary. If I have sinned, I have suffered! Have I not Done expiation, even all these years? Have I lain on beds of roses, or stood back From the sweeping sword and shot, or turned aside Because the stones were sharp and my feet were sore? I did not count the cost, but I have paid. Am I not too a woman, and my flesh As soft and white as any Queen of all? Have I not worn through, when the stoutest men Dropped off from following? Did any think My limbs were iron, though I made no moan? O my love, my love, it is not I complain! Thou hast repaid me; if I might but live And suffer by thy side for evermore, It were enough;‚Äîbut keep me now alive! Let not thine arms unloose me, till this strait Be over, and I have my babes again. ‚ÄòO Menotti, O my firstborn, thou hast not Forgotten me! Thou standest at the gate, And lookest down the road that I shall come. I am coming, O sweet smiles that wait for me! ‚ÄîO my little one, my nursling, what shall keep My feet from finding thee across the world! O warm in thy sleep, with thy crimson cheeks, and curls Crushed in the pillow, and thy rosy feet Soft and uncovered, till thy mother's hand Wraps them up softly, wilt thou not awake, And sit up smiling, and stretch out thy arms? O my lamb with the golden fleece! let me have thy head On my breast a minute,‚Äîstand with clinging feet Upon my knees! It is the hour of night When babes are frightened if they do not find Their mother. Who is holding me away? They cannot come to me, nor I to them! They are crying for me in the night, O God!‚Äô She sank down with a long and bitter cry; She did not weep, her eyes were dry and wild. But Garibaldi wrapped her in his arms, And murmured tenderly; and laid his hand Upon her forehead; and his other hand Held both of hers; and so she lay awhile, Quiet a little, shivering with long sighs. The following day we came unto the sea At Cesenatico; we overpowered The hundred Austrians of the garrison, And took possession of the place ourselves. Then we were marched down to the beach, and there We found a line of fishing-boats drawn up; And Garibaldi ordered us to form In companies of twenty-four apiece, Apportioned to the boats, thirteen in all; He keeping Ugo Bassi at his side. ‚ÄîAnd then for the first time I saw and knew That we should be divided; and my heart, Struck with the sudden blow, sank down and died. But when he saw me standing on the shore, Among the others, ready to depart, At the boat's side, Ugo came up to me, And took my hand in his, and said to me, ‚ÄòFarewell, Antonio;‚Äîfor we part to-day, And who can tell whether we meet again Out of this peril that we pass unto? And now I thank thee for this love of thine, Which thou hast given me out of thy true heart, And for thy faithful service, and thy prayers, In which forget not to remember me Still, as I thee. We both have need of prayers This hour. And if a hard doom come to thee, And cruel death or crueller life be thine, Rejoice then to have suffered for God's sake, And for our Italy's and for all men's. It may be one of us shall perish now, And one of us be left alive: and though No more thou hear the voice nor feel the hand Thou lovest, yet thou art not desolate; I leave thee to a better Friend than I. Love Him, and trust Him, follow Him with pains, ‚ÄîNot easily‚Äîthe grace is for the strife; And whatsoever trial He may lay Upon thee, trust Him through it, and give thanks; And when thy heart is heavy think on Him, And when thy need is greatest, call on Him. Hold fast God's promise, and remember this‚Äî Christ will not fail thee, though Fra Ugo may.‚Äô Then we were parted‚Äîand the end was come. VII. August, 1849. And this was how it ended:‚Äîon the third Of August, Garibaldi steered his fleet Of fishing-boats towards Venice; and at first The wind was favouring. In the boat I lay Huddled, and helpless, and most miserable; And though the helm which Garibaldi held Guided us all, and all the boats kept near Together, yet I felt the waters heave Between us, and I knew that over them Hand might not reach to hand, nor eye to eye. No, never more:‚Äîdid I not feel it then, Though yet we held the same course? So we passed A day and night, and at the break of dawn, The swift sun rising smote across the sea; And we, far off and opposite, beheld A vision all of palaces, and faint Turrets and belfries in a silvery light, Rose-tinted; on the bosom of the sea, Low down upon the last horizon line Of smooth-swept plains of liquid opal. Then The officer on board gazed out, and said, ‚ÄòIt is the Queen of the Adriatic!‚Äô and He hailed her, saying: ‚ÄòHaven of our hopes! Last Lamp of Italy, receive us now! Let us but fall on thy heroic breast, Not lost at sea, or hunted on the waste, Or buried in a prison!‚Äô And as rose The sun, the vision grew more clear and fair, And we stretched out our hands and eyes to her. But lo! another vision‚Äîand this time, A dark and deadly one. What shapes are these, These black hulls looming nearer into sight?‚Äî The Austrian fleet is bearing down on us. Already had we rounded past the cape Punta di Maestra, when they appeared, And opened fire upon us; and at once The wind veered round, and beat against us too. All round us cannon-smoke and thunder rolled, And we, dismayed, thought our last hour had come. But Garibaldi shouted all to keep Together; and still sought to force a way; And a fierce fight we held upon the sea. But all was vain; the great ships came between And scattered us; one of our boats was sunk, And seven were captured; and the prisoners forced Up the ships' sides, and cast into the holds, And to the fortress-city, Pola, brought, Loaded with chains, and there compelled to work Among the galley-slaves as criminals. And I among them. And if now it were My history which I had to relate, Not Ugo Bassi's, I might wring your hearts With what we suffered there, our tale of wrongs And cruelties, cut off from all the world. For in those months that bordered on despair, No comfort ever came to me but this, The memory of the words that Ugo spake; And, as he bade me, I remembering him Prayed ever for some succour unto Christ. But never answer came to me, except My own tears bursting as before me rose The vision of his face, when last on me Bent the beloved eyes in their farewell. Yet it may be those tears preserved my heart From breaking; and at last a comfort stole About my heart, thinking that death was near: For we of Southern nurture do not hold Our life deep-rooted, and could less endure Than could the Lombards, and we wasted fast. And many of our number out of Rome Had died already, when an order came To set us free; the statesmen having ruled Our ransom. We were under guard conveyed To the Sardinian frontier, and there left Destitute, such of us as had survived. And hearing there that Garibaldi lived, And was at Genoa,‚Äîbegging and on foot Thither I made my way, in hopes to find My master, or at least have news of him,‚Äî And there at last I learnt what had befallen. For Garibaldi with five boats escaped; And under cover of the darkness beat All night about the coast, and at the dawn Landed his company upon the beach, Near Magnavacca. In the boat with him, Besides Anita, and some others, were Ugo, and Ciceruacchio with his sons, And Count Livraghi of Bologna, who, Wounded in that encounter on the seas, Moved but in pain. The other boats contained About a hundred. All these castaways Now found themselves upon the enemy's shore, Upon the sandy Vaccolino, in The last of the great forest of the pines, That stretches from Ravenna. Death behind, And death before, still Garibaldi held Northward, if so some miracle of God Might bring them yet to Venice; and all day They travelled, traversing the boundless tracts Of the Lagunes, or lost among the reeds Of the inextricable labyrinths Of the great river's mouths and shifting sands Until at eventide they entered in A forest, which the people of those parts Call the Elysian Grove; and there at last Anita sank and could no further go, Worsted for the first time, and evermore. The shadow of her coming agony Was over her, and of her heart's despair; Seeing it was not well for her to die, As for all other women in this world, For she was Garibaldi's wife, and had Her heaven in this life;‚Äîand the other side Of the dark river she had come to cross, Walked ever the pale ghost of him who died Long years ago for her, and waved to her With clutching hands, and hollow eager eyes,‚Äî ‚ÄòI have waited long for thee, and thou art mine: My time is come;‚Äô and heavier ever came Back the reproachful memory of those times, Of love betrayed for love; and that dead life Laid a cold hand upon her heart; while yet Within her heart the impatient unborn life Shuddered and heaved;‚Äîand she was spent to death, And clung to Garibaldi, and her eyes Prayed ‚ÄòKeep me! Save me!‚Äô and he could not speak: Together they had come to their despair, No hope for him in life, or her in death. Then Garibaldi knew all hope was gone, And that his quest was over;‚Äîand he said, ‚ÄòThis is the end for us. We will stay here, My wife and I together, and abide Our fate;‚Äîand ye, most faithful to the last, Part from me here; there is no more to do. We shall not save our lives,‚Äîbut we may pray To meet once more before the throne of God, And hear from Him that Italy is saved.‚Äô Then they departed all their several ways Whither their fate should lead them. But those seven Whom I have named, a little longer kept Together, seeking yet if they might find Some shelter for Anita. And at last They came upon a woodman's cottage, set Amid the thickest forest of the pines That reached between the river and the sea,‚Äî And in it an old man, who said: ‚ÄòI have But little life to lose;‚Äîif I may yield You any aid, my last days are my best.‚Äô By the low door they lingered, for to part Was hard; and Ugo said: ‚ÄòLivraghi's wound Needs rest; no hope is there for him to cross From here to Venice, and I cannot leave Him helpless;‚Äîhe and I must take our fate, As God shall send, together.‚Äô Then the sons Of Ciceruacchio, and himself, embraced Their leader; and departed by themselves Into the forest, and were seen no more. Then Garibaldi, holding Ugo's hand: ‚ÄòThe night is coming; it is time we two Should be alone together. Is there more To say, O my beloved? We must part. God be with you, and us!‚Äô And Ugo said: ‚ÄòO Friend, O Hero, who hast lifted me Into a height and blossoming of life I dreamt not of, and set me by thy side At the world's heart, farewell! hear my last word. The hope of Italy is on thy head; Guard it, for God's sake! though each one of us Fall, and our lives pass, yet let thine remain! His work is done with us, but not with thee. Dying is easy;‚Äîkeep thou steadfastly The greater part, to live and to endure. For though we meet no more, and the fair days Are over, and my time is near at hand, I have this comfort of thee in my heart, That God has yet got many things for thee To do and suffer for our Italy, And greater things than any heretofore.‚Äô Then they wrung hands, and parted; and he turned To where Anita, seated on the ground, On the smooth carpet of the fir points fallen, Gazed with beseeching eyes for some last drop Of comfort in her anguish; and as now He saw her passing thus from life and love Away together in the gathering gloom, This parting was too cruel; and for once The utter pity overpowered the peace: And as he took her hand and looked at her, The face that to so many dying eyes Had lighted up the gathering of the dark With eyes that smiled above their mortal pain, Now quivered, and his voice broke down, and he Suddenly turned, and hurriedly away He passed, he and Livraghi, and were lost To sight, amid the shadowy forest trees. Two days from this, the setting sun lit up The Villa Spada, on the heights above Bologna, the head-quarters of the Staff Where General Gorzhowski, Governor, Sat with his Council in a close debate What other stringent measures they might take To capture Garibaldi, since till then, In spite of proclamations and rewards, And troops on every side, and Carabineers, He was not taken; nor indeed had he Since he had sailed from Cesenatico Been heard of. General Gorzhowski was Certainly not beloved in any part Of the Romagna, over which he ruled; Least of all in Bologna, which had long Held out against him, and in which his name Was spoken but with curses. Yet he was, Though far from handsome, a distinguished man, Polite too, I have heard, an ornament Of drawing-rooms, and took the hand of queens In dancing, and though choleric at times, Still a good ruler for a state of siege. To him, thus sitting, was brought in the news That now two men, stragglers and fugitives From Garibaldi's legion, had been brought In, prisoners, to head-quarters; and at once He gave command that they should be conveyed Before him. Then into the council-room Were Ugo Bassi and Livraghi brought, Loaded with chains. And upon seeing them, Gorzhowski, who with rapid utterance spoke, And sometimes choked with passion, poured his wrath And disappointment forth on them, and with Unmeasured words reviled them; and went on: ‚ÄòSo you are caught at last! You are the first, But will not be the last;‚Äîbut you shall have The privilege of serving to the rest For an example. Every one of you Already is condemned. You will be shot To-morrow morning;‚Äîand you need not hope For mercy, unless one of you indeed Had the good luck to know the whereabouts Of the vile Bandit whom you call your Chief. That, has been set forth under seal of ours, Should save the veriest scoundrel of you all His punishment. But beggars such as you Are not so likely to be favoured with His counsels, or to know the way he took.‚Äô And Ugo answered calmly, ‚ÄòYes, we know.‚Äô Like one who digs for iron and strikes gold, Gorzhowski started;‚Äîbut recovering, Burst forth in thunder, ‚ÄòDare you jest with me? Do you think insolent lies will save your life? You have made up some tale to pass on me: It will be worse for you than you think yet, Unless you prove your words, and that at once. The adjutant who had escorted them Came forward, saying, ‚ÄòSir, they speak the truth Two days ago was Garibaldi seen Near Magnavacca, and these men with him. But every trace of him has since been lost, And these were taken yesterday, alone, Sleeping within a tavern stable-loft Close to Comacchio.‚Äô Then Gorzhowski said, ‚ÄòIf this be so, you yet shall have a chance, The only chance any of you can have, And that is, a reprieve, until I find Whether you really know what you profess. The Son of Satan last was seen with you, And you shall show me where to find him now I stand no lying, and the sooner caught, The better it will be for both of you. I give you but two days of grace in all, And if he be not here within the time, No crying back will save you afterwards.‚Äô Thus spake Gorzhowski, fuming, full of rage, And hardly looking at them all the time; While Ugo stood in silence until he Paused:‚Äîand the overworn and sleepless eyes Dreamed back one moment to the forest-gloom, And the farewells beneath the slumbrous pines; And the lips parted as to some sweet air Peacefully, lost in visions far away; One moment only,‚Äîthen the voice was firm And recollected, and thrilled all the room: ‚ÄòGod guard him safe from you! God shelter him! Neither for life, nor death, nor any boon, Nor any penalty that you can give, Will we give tidings of him.‚Äô Pale and mute The Council sat astonished, but the Chief, Struck dumb with sudden impotence of rage, Gasped chokingly in a bewildered blank Of silence,‚Äîand at last looked up and knew The stately figure and the noble face That, travel-soiled, and buffeted, and faint From fastings, and from wanderings, and from storms, Before him stood with clear confronting eyes, Glorious and grave, knowing the hour was come, And now must God be glorified:‚Äîand he, Stung by intolerance of a voice like this, Burst in redoubled fury, ‚ÄòWho are you That dare to answer me with insolence? I will have no more words! You think perhaps An Austrian barrack is a brigand's camp, Where one makes speeches to the officers, And bargains for the terms that one will take. The Council is dismissed:‚Äîsend out the Posts, And fetch the guard;‚Äîand you shall know at once Whether I mean to be obeyed or no; For words were wasted on two mules like you.‚Äô What followed I can not relate in full, Because there were no friendly witnesses; If there had been, my heart would bleed so fast At every word, I would not though I could. For Christ can bear to look upon such things, Having Himself endured the same for us; And martyrs can themselves endure the same When their time comes, they having grace of God; But for us common flesh and blood, these deeds Are only terrible, and ill to speak. For then the Austrian (may the fiery claws Of devils tear his soul in hell for it!) Commanded them to seize, and bind, and scourge Fra Ugo and Livraghi in his sight, And show no mercy till they answered him. And to that chamber only entered in Gorzhowski and his executioners. And all night long he had his way, and worked His worst upon them, yet had not his will. For morning came, as it will come at last To every sleepless night; and all night long Hussars had scoured the country far and wide Like hounds,‚Äîand Garibaldi was not found, Nor tidings heard of him,‚Äîand not one word Of his betrayal yet had crossed the lips Of those two prisoners punished; and both lay At point of death, and none could hurt them more. And now Gorzhowski, more infuriate still, Seeing that time was lost and nothing gained, Gave orders to his adjutant, at once To have the execution carried out In the court-yard below,‚Äîwith yet a hope That at the sudden supreme touch of all, The shock of the fresh air, the deadly files, The pointing muzzles close against their eyes, They in their weakness might be startled once Into a momentary failing, which Should lay the slender secret in his hands, By which hung all the hope of Italy, Which in each moment of delay he felt Slipping away from him. But doubtfully The adjutant replied, ‚ÄòSir, one of them Being a monk, the military power Has not authority to punish him Without the sanction of the Church; since we Are here upon the footing of allies Of the Pontifical Supremacy.‚Äô On which Gorzhowski answered, with an oath: ‚ÄòIt is too late for that! But anyhow The Holy Church shall give consent to it, Before he dies. Pray, sir, do you suppose They will presume to question anything I choose to order? I have taught them all How I am to be treated. I am here Civil and Military Governor, The sole and sovereign representative Of his Imperial Majesty. These priests Have me to thank that they are back at all. I brought them here, I keep them here; and I Intend that they shall know their proper place. This Cardinal Bedini gives himself, Being the Legate of the Pope, the airs Of Governor, and turns and twists to find Some way to circumvent me, and to get The upper hand. Do you remember, sir, What happened when we first reduced the place To order, and the Legate was restored? As nobody appeared inclined to thank The Lord for sending us, we piously Thanked Him ourselves. We had a grand Te Deum, There was a state procession, and the rest: And then I found that it had been arranged By Monsignor Bedini, that himself Should take the lead, as the most eminent Personage present. But I interposed, Saying, ‚ÄúYou understand me, Cardinal;‚Äî I in Bologna am the First, and I, On this occasion and all future ones, Shall take my place accordingly.‚Äù And he In his most bland and condescending way Said, ‚ÄúCertainly:‚Äîas our distinguished guest, All honour shall be paid His Excellency.‚Äù But I returned as promptly: ‚ÄúNot at all‚Äî You quite mistake me,‚ÄîI am neither guest Nor friend of yours,‚Äîbut I am Master here; And I go first;‚Äù‚Äîand so His Eminence, After much cogitating, found in vain, Was forced to walk behind.‚ÄîHis smile was sweet. Since that submission I keep terms with him. And he shall now give up his priest to me, In his own writing. Take this note to him, And bring me back his answer, and be quick!‚Äô And while the messenger was on his way, He ordered all to be in readiness For the two prisoners to be put to death. So the guard took them forth, and set them down Beside a pillar in the common hall, The soldiers coming and going through the doors. And they, being spent with torture, lifted not Their heads again, nor uttered any word; And no one dared to succour them, or bring A cup of water to them. The slow time Wore on, and still Gorzhowski chafed and chafed At the delay.‚ÄîAnd at this time, it were As well to note down certain passages Which had occurred a little while before, And had some bearing upon Ugo's fate. For, as it happened, two days previously, Here in Bologna, in the ‚ÄòWeek's Gazette,‚Äô Cardinal Oppizzoni, now restored,‚Äî (A very holy, charitable man, Whose virtue counterbalanced to the Church The far-from-edifying private life Of Monsignor Bedini),‚Äîhad put forth This much-admired archiepiscopal Effusion,‚Äîwhich is here subjoined entire:‚Äî ‚ÄòAmidst the tribulations, and the floods Of turbulence, that, in the year elapsed, Afflicted these unhappy Provinces, The horror of whose memory still is fresh In the imagination,‚Äîone great grief Pierced to the very bottom of our heart, (Second alone to that unspeakable Anguish with which we listened to, and saw The sacrilegiously-committed crimes Against God and His Vicar);‚Äîand that one Was this, the cruel silence laid on us By a severe and sad necessity. Since above all things we desired the power As Pastor and as parent to uplift Our voice in speech, that we might roll away Each stone of scandal and perdition hence; As also to let loose the simple ones Out of the snares spread forth by certain men, ‚ÄîSuch men as that are very few, thank God!‚Äî But all the more audacious in their acts Of evil,‚Äîonly too conspicuous by Ecclesiastical habiliments, And under obligation to a vow Monastic,‚Äîviolating every law, Contaminating consciences with free And frantic declamations, publicly Maintaining theories ridiculous, As that the supreme power of government Is a precarious gift, and held in trust By rulers for the population,‚Äîthus Exciting general disparagement Of all dominion, and, as says Saint Jude, Blaspheming every majesty, (the text,‚Äî ‚ÄúDespise dominion, and speak evil of Dignities‚Äù); and moreover setting light By the most sacred, venerable rites And doctrines of religion; treating them As superstitions and of no account; ‚ÄîWith manners at the least equivocal, And impudently taking on themselves To mend the Church's morals. Certainly It was not any fear of private harm, Nor any peril threatening our own life, (Already at its term) which held us back From speaking, or which caused us to retire; (For well we know that the good Shepherd should Devote himself a holocaust to save The flock committed to his care); and you Surely remember that we solemnly Protested against all these infamies, And that our exhortation was received With impudent derision. We were bound By two considerations,‚Äîon one hand, Mindful of that admonitory text Fitting the times (Ecclesiasticus, The twentieth chapter and the seventh verse) Sapiens tacebit usque ad tempus,‚Äîthen Upon the other hand too well aware What prudence and what circumspection were Required of us in such a crisis,‚Äînay Enjoined upon us by His Holiness The Supreme Pontiff, (until He Himself By scandalous audacity was driven An exile from the Apostolic See), And that the urgent and reiterated Appeals to duty met with no response From those who should have been the first to give Effect to them,‚Äînothing remained for us But to stand far off, and weep bitter tears Between the porch and the altar,‚Äîcomforted Only, by thinking that we might exclaim With great Tertullian, Father of the Church, (In Apologia, chapter thirty-eight), ‚ÄîNihil est Nobis cum insania circi. But now that God once more has poured on us The treasures of his mercy infinite, And has replaced us in the plenitude And exercise of our episcopal Functions and ministry,‚Äîonce more we say, Sapiens tacebit usque ad tempus. Now The time has come, and we shall duly speak. ‚ÄòAnd now, O most beloved sons, do we Address these words to you, but not as though They were required to reconduct your feet Into the paths of rectitude and truth, ‚ÄîFor most of you have never strayed away,‚Äî But to encourage you to follow on Strong and magnanimous:‚ÄîEstote, says The Scripture to us, speaking of these days, Fortes in bello. Truly it becomes Us all to trample with heroic scorn The fatal records of that impious war The powers of darkness waged against your souls;‚Äî Satan himself transformed into a false Similitude,‚Äîan angel as it were Of light,‚Äîan aspect full of joy and peace, And full of lying promises to you Of treacherous felicity. Not here Will we repeat, O cherished sons of ours, The florid blasphemies with which the Name Most Holy of the Crucified was made To serve as watchword to incite revolt Against a Pontiff ever venerable. Did they not even dare to represent The holy Sacrament of Penitence As in the hands of priests an instrument Of fraud and of conspiracy?‚Äîwere not The blackest calumnies sown broadcast by These ministers of Belial?‚Äîdid they not Openly publish doctrines tending to Error, and even heresy, and schism? Did they not crucify afresh the Son Of God, and put Him to an open shame? And, under cover of a warfare waged Against hypocrisy and retrograde Movement, stir up the fires of civil rage, And seek to fling among our Clergy here (Pacific, exemplary every way), And among the misguided mob, the seeds Of horrible and most pestiferous Divisions? ‚ÄòNow, Beloved, cast away Far from you, and forget the very sound Of horrid words like these, whose blasphemies Offended even the least pious ears; Or recollect them only just so far As to bring back a salutary thrill Of pleasing horror, as if, saved yourselves, You heard foul maledictions far away, Or crying out of the Infernal Pit. ‚ÄòNor should the fine conceits of patriotism‚Äî By which was sought to smooth the enormity Of these excesses, and to lure away The simple in a snare, and to inflame The multitudes,‚Äîawaken, O Beloved, Any hallucination in your minds. Beware lest any man spoil you, Saint Paul Says, through philosophy and vain deceit, After traditions, not of Christ but men. (The Second of Colossians, and eighth verse). The love of Country is a holy thing, When in the first place, one accords to God The love and honour that we owe to Him; And when we duly have observed His laws, Which are all charity, and which are placed Within the sacred custody alone Of His Most Holy Vicar, Pope of Rome, And of His Bishops;‚Äîbut these holy things Are not to be dragged sacrilegiously Through taverns, market-places, public haunts, With impious and profane apostasy, Insulting to Saint Peter and the Church. These laws command the rich to help the poor And to give alms; and also they command The poor, by their hard labour to relieve Their own distresses, or at least to bear The allotted burdens without discontent. But, O Eternal God! what have we heard! What doctrines desolating, tending to Destruction of all order, and all bonds Civil and social, dinned into our ears By truculent conspirators! Instead Of the mild precepts of the Gospel lore, Compelled to listen to the blandishments And wiles, addressed to baser passions, roused And flattered, and excited to a pitch Of wickedness, which (if it had not been For God, and for the intercessory Grace and beneficence of His Divine Mother) was such that never has the world In all its days, perhaps, beheld the like. With every ancient barrier broken down Of morals, decency, religion, Man Would speedily degenerate to the state Of brutes and savages;‚Äîwith furthermore This most unprecedented perfidy, That the infuriated demagogues Of this Peninsula, our native land So fair and so unhappy,‚Äîwaging war On all authority and all the rights Of property, themselves were all the time Rapacious and unscrupulous to seize On all the public and the private funds, And arrogated to themselves a rule Of savage and unheard-of tyranny. ‚ÄòNo more of them, Beloved! nor of those Who would have proped up such a state of things By sophistries, by snares, by violent speech. Let us look to ourselves, and let us be Sober and vigilant;‚Äîlet us beware Lest in our own minds should intrude some taint Of this absurd and pestilent scepticism, Which is the death of every principle, Which snaps each curb, and leaves the mind a prey To every breath of chance, and hurls the soul Downwards from depth to depth of the abyss, Till it sends up at last the awful cry There is no God. Never let us depart From that philosophy of Gospel truth Alone infallible:‚Äîand let us be True and good Catholics, then shall we be True and good citizens; let us fulfil With a clear conscience every duty here Belonging to our station; let us love Our country with a reasonable love; Let us be zealous after all good works: ‚ÄîSo shall we rise to all desirable Felicity; and let us vanquish all Ill-regulated passions,‚Äîthen shall we Have vanquished our most fierce and impious foes. ‚ÄòFor all these blessings, O Beloved, we pray To God for you, and with all ferventness, Our pastoral benediction we confer Upon you, from the fulness of our heart. ‚ÄòDelivered from our archiepiscopal Palace, Bologna, under our own hand, The Third of August, Eighteen Forty Nine. (Signed) Carlo Oppizzoni, Cardinal.‚Äô No one pretended not to recognise Who was the special sinner pointed out Therefore it was a clear coincidence Of Providence, when now the news was brought In private, to the Palace, just at dusk, That Ugo Bassi, the man's very self, Was taken, and alive, and in the hands Of General Gorzhowski,‚Äînews indeed Almost too good to be believed by some:‚Äî But the Archbishop piously exclaimed, ‚ÄòNunc Dimittis! We have him safe at last. And in the Legate's Palace, instantly A secret council was convened,‚Äînine priests Belonging to Bologna, and three more Of Hungary;‚Äîand what was done and said Is not exactly known;‚Äîbut this is sure, (Since the betrayer often is betrayed) It was agreed that Ugo Bassi's death Would be a pleasing and religious act, And that the law ecclesiastical Should not be put in force to interfere. And all the nine priests of Bologna signed A secret document to this effect; (I know their names,‚ÄîI will not write them down Here on this page that bears the name of him). But the three priests of Hungary refused To put their hands to it; and they were seen To pass out weeping. Also be it known, That the Archbishop took no part in these Proceedings, neither gave consent, nor yet Came forward with a protest; spoke no word To save him or destroy him; but stayed still, And waited patiently to see the end. Now, to Gorzhowski's summons in due time Arrived the answer of the Cardinal: ‚ÄòAccept, your Excellency, our best thanks For your most courteous and most gracious note Received, concerning the seditious monk Called Ugo Bassi. In the Church's name, Of Which unworthy representative I here abide, I gratefully express My satisfaction at delivering him Without conditions over to the arm Of military jurisdiction.‚ÄîMore,‚Äî Under great obligation we shall feel If you will only take upon yourself The punishment which at our hands is due To him. Not only has he joined himself With Garibaldi, when he lately raised Open revolt against the Papal See, And is de facto excommunicate;‚Äî But has been long obnoxious to us here, As a disturber and a heretic, And of the most pernicious sort of all, ‚ÄîBeing not of those who merely vex the brains Of common people by their arguments,‚Äî But one of those who win their hearts, by show Of sympathy, and words they understand, And succour to their bodies in distress, With a severe simplicity of life; ‚ÄîIn a malicious contradiction set For the sound doctrine that would save their souls, With fatherly indulgence for their sins. Had it not been for the perplexities And troubles of the Church in these last years, He would not have been left at large so long. The Prior of his convent was a fool, And knows it now,‚Äîhe has had that to learn Unpleasantly, since order was restored, In a safe corner of Saint Angelo,‚Äî And so encouraged him,‚Äîhe was a fool And nothing worse,‚Äîbut this notorious man, With his smooth face, and his officiousness, And help among the poor, and talk of Christ, Has been a thorn and scandal to the Church This long time past,‚Äîand in particular Being born in it, this diocese of mine He has infested like a croaking frog When one would sleep at night, and been to me A perfect Plague of Egypt. I am glad You have him now; and for his punishment We owe you many favours;‚Äîand be sure The Church will ask no reckoning at your hands For any blood of his;‚Äîdo what you will. The sooner done the better;‚Äîbut take care It be done quietly these dangerous times. For in Bologna is his very name A watchword, and the very stones would rise To rescue, if they guessed at harm to him. And as you know, though not so well as I, (Who, meeting only with ingratitude, Have laboured long among them for their good,) The people of this city are perverse, And deadly, not to be dealt lightly with,‚Äî The most stiff-necked, indomitable race In Italy. But I have trust this time, That with God's blessing all will yet go well, And peaceably;‚Äîand most sincerely hope No interruption nor unpleasantness Is likely to occur, to interfere With your most gracious visit promised me This evening;‚Äîwhich I have looked forward to With liveliest emotions of delight Anticipated, and have spared no pains To make my poor and unpretending house Worthy the honour you confer on it. My chief has promised to surpass himself In beccaficos, which your Excellency Was pleased to praise last time; and I myself Make it my own peculiar care to see That the Lachryma Christi perfectly Be in condition to ensure from you A generous commendation. I may say, Between ourselves, that that French company Which you remember, which you said yourself Was the best entertainment you have seen, Have promised their most choice performances At my particular and private place Of residence (Saint Michael's Bower, outside The gates, by the Certosa), where we two Can retire later, and amuse ourselves, And no one be the wiser. I remain Your Excellency's humblest servant, and Devoted friend, Bedini, Cardinal.‚Äô Having impatiently glanced over this, Gorzhowski growled,‚Äî‚ÄòWhat do I care for all His quarrels? Heretic or othodox, It is all one to me. Italian priests Are one as good as another.‚ÄîOf the two, This stubborn fellow who hates me as well As I hate him, each for our country's sake, Is worth as much as this devoted friend, Who would put poison in my wine to-night, If he but dared. Why should I be the cloak For his hypocrisy, and steal away For his amusements? I am not ashamed; I have no character for holiness To keep or lose;‚Äîand if I choose to have His players practise in the public streets, It shall be done. But I am glad to learn That the good people of Bologna make So great a favourite of this monk of theirs. I have a grudge to pay them; they shall have The pleasure now of seeing how I serve Such holy friars. But there shall be no time For brewing mischief.‚Äô On the instant then, He ordered out ten thousand infantry To take possession of the gates and streets, And keep the way; and that the prisoners should Be carried through the city to the place Of execution, and all ignominy, As felons and assassins, laid on them. First, through the gates the Artillery rolled out, And passing through the Porta Mamolo, Along the streets heavily clangouring, Was stationed in the corners of the squares, The cannon pointing down the crowded lines; And then, along the middle of the streets, The cavalry began to clear a way, And took up their position, waiting there. And on the hum and business of the town An awful noontide stillness seemed to fall: And all the dwellers from the arcades and courts Began to gather on the line of march, Uncertain what should happen, but prepared For something evil, and expecting it. For nothing was so dreadful in those days, Or sad, or wonderful, as to seem strange; And every day brought some new tragedy. The best walked gravely, knowing that themselves Might be the next called out to play their part; And the most idle lived in doubt and dread. Meanwhile, up in the Villa Spada, spoke Gorzhowski:‚Äî‚ÄòOne last chance I give you now; Pardon, or death:‚Äîmake haste;‚Äîyour hour has come And Ugo Bassi answered, ‚ÄòWe have chosen. But grant to us, since we are dying this hour, And this world's strifes are over, one last boon, For love of Christ who died for thee and me. As we forgive thee, so forgive thou us, That we have thwarted thee and made thee sin: And let us have the sacraments of death Brought to us:‚Äîthat my friend, and I, and thou May eat together, and then part in peace.‚Äô The Austrian answered, ‚ÄòWhat an impudent Proposal! You and I in peace, indeed! You think to cheat me so to save your soul. Obstinate as you are, you shall not have Mercy from me for that. Do you not know The Cardinal-Legate has himself declared The Church has cast you out, and that you are A heretic and excommunicate? Live,‚Äîon my terms,‚Äîbut there is left you now Only a few more moments:‚Äîthere shall be Neither viaticum nor shrift for you. And as my rods have ploughed your flesh, my balls Shall crush your bones and batter out your brains. And leave your bodies to the kites and crows, And send your soul to hell;‚Äîand once go there, The Devil is more than match for you or me!‚Äô Then Ugo faintly smiled, and turned himself Towards Livraghi, and reached hands to him; And said, ‚ÄòMy brother, we shall drink no more, Of the fruit of the vine, until we drink it new‚Äô‚Äî The voice failed, and the parched lips uttered not. Then were the prisoners manacled with cords, Placed in a cart, and carried from the doors Of Villa Spada downwards to the town, Between the squadrons of the cavalry; The muffled drums beating a funeral march Before them;‚Äîand beside, Gorzhowski rode, In wait for his last opportunity. So they moved on, and traversing the town, Went down one long street, and another one, Strada Isaia, towards the further gate; And Ugo Bassi's face, without the smile, With the faint lips, and brows of agony, Passed through the city; and the murmurs grew,‚Äî ‚ÄòNot Garibaldi‚Äîno‚Äîbut those who last Were seen with him,‚Äô‚Äîand still the rumours grew;‚Äî Until at last a cry rose suddenly Along the streets,‚Äî‚ÄòIt is himself! our friend; Our townsman, Ugo Bassi!‚Äô‚Äîand at once The fiery quickness of the Romagnole Darted upon the truth, and they knew all. And when they saw the beautiful pure face, Faithful unto the last for Italy, Carried between them, with its sacred seal Of silence through its last extremity, Without an answer to the yearning eyes Now, any more than to the cruel hands,‚Äî The passion of the people broke aloud Hopeless, and helpless:‚Äîthey had got no arms, (Gorzhowski searched the town two months before, And carried forty thousand muskets off To Mantua); and they had got no time,‚Äî Women and children, a defenceless crowd; But casting off all fear and all restraint, Sobbings and imprecations filled the air, Wild cries for vengeance rising over them; Until beneath the shrill and raving storm, At last Gorzhowski shivered as he rode,‚Äî Hell-fire of hisses raking him all down The long streets opening into longer ones, Lined with the curses broken loose at last; Not one, not a thousand, but the whole great town, Men, mothers, babes, a countless multitude,‚Äî More terrible because the trampled hands Had never a helper left them now but God. Struck into silence, he rode pale and foiled, And desperate in his impotent revenge.‚Äî But though the people gathered up, and streamed Behind the cavalcade, it passed along More quickly, and was out of reach, before They well knew what it was had come to them. About a mile outside the city-gate, Porta Isaia, lies the felon's field; And close beside it lies the Cemetery, Certosa, to the westward of the walls; The Mount of Guard above it, with its church And portico to give the pilgrims' feet Safe-conduct to our Lady of Saint Luke, Stands for a landmark many miles away. Bologna knows it well;‚Äîthere is no child Born in Bologna but shall know the place. And there they halted, past the wailing throngs; And there they formed a square of infantry; And then there was a silence, very short; And then three volleys rang out, one by one, Through the still, sultry air. Bologna heard, And knew that all was over. After that, Gorzhowski cleared the streets, and suffered none To show themselves abroad again that day. They dug a grave, and threw the bodies in, Just where they fell, and hardly covered them. But the next morn, as if by miracle, The cruel mound had blossomed into wreaths,‚Äî Clusters of summer-snowing stars in heaps On glossy trailing leaves, and roses red As any Dorothea sent her friend. And night by night the grave lay fresh in flowers, In spite of all the Austrian arms could do. But who shall utter of that day's despair, Through all Bologna, as the hours went on? The cry rose up from all the populace; ‚ÄòHe saved others from the perishing: Himself he did not save!‚Äô Yea, didst not save Thyself, O Ugo Bassi, from the cross Of pain, and death, and man's last cruelty! But God did save thee, and did shelter thee From all dishonour and from all despair, From any falling off of faith in Him, Or hope in man: and gave thee thy desire, To die as thou hadst lived, for love of love. What of the others, who that mournful day Landed with Garibaldi? Nothing more Than this is known of most of them, that they Were never seen again. The river-wastes Engulfed them; they were hunted on the hills, Starved in the forests, slain by bloody hands, Killed by wild beasts, devoured, or left to lie Unburied; they were scattered in the wilds; They perished:‚Äîwill not God remember them? And in those same days perished Angelo Brunetti, and his two sons, cruelly Slain by the Austrians;‚Äîtortured, as some say, And after, murdered;‚Äîbut I have met none Who knew the very manner of their deaths. Thou, Angelo the Roman, didst not miss The palm of angels;‚Äîbut they say in Rome, Down the Ripetta, where he dwelt before, Ciceruacchio is not really dead, But only lost:‚Äîin prison, it may be, The more the pity,‚Äîbut he will come back. He did not say good-bye to them, his house Is standing ready for him, and they come Morning and evening there to look, and ask, If in meantime he has arrived at home. And when the floods rise, and the poor are driven Out of their homes to gather shelterless, Or in the winter when the meal is scarce, They ask each other, Will Madonna send Ciceruacchio back to us to-day? And never have they given up hope of him. But Garibaldi knows that he is dead, And told me so. . . . . And on the eighth of August, the same day And the same hour that Ugo Bassi died, Anita died in childbirth, in the arms Of Garibaldi, and her child with her. And Garibaldi dug a grave himself, And buried them, alone, within the depths Of the pine-forest, near the murmuring sea. Then Garibaldi, broken-hearted, passed Across the rivers, and the forests, to Ravenna:‚Äîand this marvel came to pass,‚Äî That in those dreadful darkest days of all, He, with the face that no man could mistake, With a king's ransom set upon his head, His own life forfeit, and each other life Of whom should harbour him but for an hour, Outlawed, and banned, and excommunicate, With the whole forces of the Empire set Upon each byway and each house for him, Careless of life himself, and broken down,‚Äî Did single-handed and unharmed pass through The utter breadth of Italy; and passed Again across the mountains by the way Of Tuscany; and into Genoa Entered at last, a solitary man, The only one of all that company That had survived;‚Äîand there his countrymen Received and welcomed him with one accord. But no one ever saw him smile again. But at the time I came to Genoa, The King of Piedmont's Government, hemmed round By Powers that hated Freedom and the Name Of Italy, dared harbour him no more. So they commanded him and all of his Out of their coasts and cities to depart. Then, seeing that my native land no more Would yield me any spot of hers whereon I might have shelter, I, enforced to flee, Sought Garibaldi for a counsellor. And he directed me to find my way To England, where he said I should be safe, The only refuge left inviolate. And he set me on board an English ship;‚Äî But sailed himself out to America. So I to London came, and have dwelt there All the days since, the dark and doleful days. And I have seen Mazzini since I came; But he is changed, and grey, only the eyes Are glorious like the eyes that lighted Rome. But little can he do to succour me, And little can I do to help myself. Here live I in a land that never knew How fair the smiling of the sun can be;‚Äî Alone,‚Äîin squalid poverty and rags, Amid the roaring of the dismal streets, And fog, and dripping rain, and cold at nights And have but one hope left to live upon,‚Äî That death will take me soon, and I shall see Ugo once more. (And here I will note down Some things I have heard since at various times, Concerning those who brought about his death.) A few weeks after, Venice, too, had fallen, And the last spark was trodden out, beneath The iron heel of Austria, on our soil. And then, for his distinguished services, And signal merits, and heroic zeal, Was General Gorzhowski lifted to The place of honour over all his peers; And formally appointed to the post He had been proved so worthy to adorn, As Governor of Venice. His reward And added dignity sit well on him, ‚ÄîBeloved as much as ever. Venice now Lies very quiet underneath his hand,‚Äî As a Queen violated lives with him That slew her lord. Eyes cannot kill, he thinks. If he be happy, let him be, while yet He may,‚Äîthe end is not yet come for him. Cardinal Oppizzoni gives God thanks That he has lived so long, and outlived all His enemies, and seen the Church prevail; And unmolested in his dignities, Remains as well as ever,‚Äîtaking care To run no further risks of any sort, By anything approaching to a life Of action. It is good, no doubt, to live; Especially when one is not quite sure What may come after death. That other one, Bedini, has a look within his eyes As if the wolves were after him;‚Äîand he, For all his silk, and down, and costly wines, And the fair chambers at Saint Michael's Bower, Sleeps ill at nights they say, and frightens those Who watch beside him. But thou sleepest well, Ugo, my Ugo! No one dares to speak, There openly, but there is a report, That on the day of Ugo Bassi's death, Two officers at the head-quarters there Were broken of their rank, and sent disgraced To Mantua. Because, as it is said, The one who should have given the word to fire Would not, or could not do it; and the next In turn refused; and they had need to find A third. He was promoted speedily. Also when the authorities perceived That Ugo Bassi's grave became a shrine Of pilgrimage, where thousands day by day Came weeping, and in mourning, carrying wreaths; And likewise that they tried to bear away His body to some place of sepulture Where no one should disturb them in their tears,‚Äî It was resolved to stop disturbances By being beforehand with them. And one night The bodies secretly were disinterred, And buried in a place which no one knew, In the Certosa. Various rumours rose, But none were certain; till a letter fell Into some hands it was not meant for, from The Cardinal Bedini to the Pope, With pious satisfaction telling him How things had been arranged, and adding that The thing had been effected with all care And circumspection; and that it was thought By most, that Ugo Bassi's friends themselves Had come by night, and stolen him away; Which for the moment pacified their minds; And soon, he hoped, the subject might be dropped. The same illustrious prelate, at the time Of Ugo's execution and his friend's, Wrote formally to notify the same To the Commission of the Roman States, Taking occasion to declare as well, That neither he, nor the Most Eminent Archbishop had had intimation given Them previously of the deplorable Occurrence. Also I have heard it said That, underneath his garment, on his heart, They found the poem I had seen him write, Unfinished, pierced with balls, and soaked with blood; And some one took it, and delivered it Secretly to his friends for payment given; And that they keep it hidden. But these things Who knoweth? There is silence of the grave Throughout the length and breadth of Italy. Yea, and I too have come unto my doom For thy sake, Italy, and most for thine, My master, who didst open me the way. I, only following by a glorious face, Found that it led through waters and through fires, Through wildernesses, to the dark‚Äîthe dark; Who might have now been lying in the thyme Unvexed by any trouble of the world, Upon the sweetest of the Southern hills. I left them:‚Äînothing now remains to me But this, that I was once a son of thine, O Italy, the land where Ugo lies. Remember when thou countest up thy lost, That I was one of them! Nay, Italy, Shouldst thou remember? Have I not been told That Italy is dead, is dead, at last? She has not breathed, or stirred since Ugo died. He was the last whose blood was shed for her. I have endured two winters in this land, In hunger, and in hardship, and alone; And have not now much left in me of life. I have met many exiles like myself, But not another from the South, like me; And some of them have died since I came here. Yet I have had some solace:‚Äîfor one night, When I had tossed awake for many hours, Alone within my dark and empty room, Thinking in pity of his cruel end, The vision of it haunted me, and rose Too plain, too clear,‚Äîthe torn and bleeding flesh, The mangled limbs, the bitter unslaked thirst, The tender hands, so used to minister To every need of others, bound and bruised, And helpless in their agony:‚Äîand I Wept, and wept on, and felt my heart would break. And then into my room there came a light, And in the light a face was close to me, And lo, it was my Ugo's very self. And he himself was standing at my side; And smiled as if no pain had ever wrung The lovely lips, and leant, and spake to me: ‚ÄòWhy weepest thou for me, who lovest me? I trusted God: He gave me my desire; Listen, and I will show thee of my heart. Christ laid a blessed yoke upon my youth, To follow Him among his poor and sad, And I was happy, but not utterly. Sometimes the way was weary to my feet, Sometimes the world rang hollow to my voice, And sometimes when I smiled my heart was sore; And the dull days and toilsome round became A weariness and burden to my soul; And I thought of the Rose of Life, shut fast for me. But in my dreams beheld another Rose Fairer and redder, Rose of Martyrdom, Set high above me, on the Tree of Life. And when not daring to look up, I saw That Christ Himself went up and gathered it, And held it out to me, then I abashed Drew back, replying, ‚ÄúNay, Lord, not for me?‚Äù And yet that dream came to me many times.‚Äî God made a miracle, and gave to me This flower for keeping, Garibaldi's life, And Italy's deliverance;‚Äîand He said, ‚ÄúClose fast thy hand upon it, while they tear Body from soul;‚Äù and I had my desire. And for that passage which so hurts thy heart, Because thou lov'st me over tenderly, Believe me that I think no more of it Than a mother, when she hears her babe's first cry Thinks of her sorrow. Shall we wear our palms, And pay no price for them? I do not say That it was nothing‚ÄîGod help every soul That comes to such an hour! but I thank Him For grace vouchsafed to me to hold fast my Rose With all its thorns, through those tempestuous gates Of mortal sorrow, drowning every sense In seas of anguish driven wave on wave Before a cold salt wind that on the cold Faint brow and closed eyes still blew bitterly, Out of the deeps of darkness, through the still Faster o'ersweeping of the waterfloods, Past sight or sound, past counting of the time, Past all remembering, all forecasting sense, Past prayer‚Äîone hour for that, one hour for this,‚Äî This, that had come to me, ‚ÄúThis is their hour Now, and the power of darkness,‚Äù‚Äîso I held, Clasping, as shipwrecked fingers clasp a spar After all sense has swooned out of the brain, This one sole word, Now‚Äînever else but Now:‚Äî When lo! the tossing ceased, and suddenly I knew the harbour, and a golden light Round me, and kind hands helping me to shore, And my Rose safe.‚ÄîNay, never weep for me! And if thou mournest any, mourn for her Who died at the same hour for the same faith In Garibaldi's arms, because her pain Was more than mine, and she had loss besides. ‚ÄòWait but a little! I may tell thee not The things that are before;‚Äîthat thou and I Did suffer not in vain for. Not in vain.‚Äô And in the sooty dawn I woke alone; And every day I wake alone, and know No joy of life will come again.‚ÄîO Christ, I cannot reach thee, I am ignorant! Thou sentest once Thy Saint to succour me In my extremity; and when he left Me in this world, he left me in Thy charge: Now therefore for his sake remember me, And be Thyself my Friend that he is gone. Though in this world I may not see Thy Face‚Äî This world that must be dark for me till death‚Äî Yet through the darkness hold me by the hand, That when I meet him, I mav meet Thee too! AGESILAO MILANO. Naples, 1856. For the glory and the passion of this midnight, I praise Thy name, I give Thee thanks, O Christ! Thou that hast neither failed me nor forsaken, Through these hard hours with victory overpriced; Now that I too of Thy passion have partaken, For the world's sake called, elected, sacrificed. Thou wast alone through Thy redemption-vigil, Thy friends had fled; The angel at the garden from Thee parted, And solitude instead, More than the scourge, or cross, O tender-hearted, Under the crown of thorns bowed down Thy head. But I, amid the torture, and the taunting, I have had Thee! Thy hand was holding my hand fast and faster, Thy voice was close to me, And glorious eyes said, ‚ÄòFollow me, thy Master, Smile as I smile thy faithfulness to see.‚Äô Thou hast not called me only, but enabled, To do Thy will; Between the flesh and spirit put no severance, That I might all fulfil; Given me grace to strike the land's deliverance, Given me strength to suffer and be still. Naples is glad because her king has fallen By my hand first; Take home the lesson to thee, faithless warden, The foremost and the worst, Who makest of this lovely land, God's garden, A nation violate, corrupt, accurst. This right hand, wasted now by knife and furnace, Struck home the blow; Whether he die to-night or he recover, This and no more they know, To follow me one hundred are sworn over, Whose names they would tear from me ere I go. Follow me all, and fear not, O my brothers, For this ye see; I who passed first confirm you by this token, Stronger than them are we; For cord, and fire, and steel to me have spoken, And none have had an answer out of me. Is not the air still sickened with the scorching Of flesh from bone? Is not the blood from stripes on stripes unslackened Still dripping to the stone? Loosened at last, each limb falls bruised and blackened Into a stiffening weight of fire alone. Master, our hearts can save us as thou spakest! Have they not spent All night their uttermost on me unholpen? Behold my body rent And broken;‚Äîbut among the wounds wide open Ye will not find a broken sacrament. By the deed done, by torture overmastered, And death outbraved, For ever from denial and dishonour, Soul, thou this night art saved! Italia, with the purple robe upon her, Shall know me faithful by these scars engraved. ‚ÄòSpared but till sunrise;‚Äîelse would Death forestall us, Mercifullest.‚Äô Yea, all their worst is done, they cannot keep me Now, should they do their best. Back from the gates of Paradise, nor steep me In any healing balm of earthly rest. Sunrise! and it is summer, and the morning Waits glorified An hour hence, when the cool clear rose-cloud gathers About heaven's eastern side, And down the azure grottoes where the bathers Loose the tired limbs, a lovely light will glide. Fold after fold the winding waves of opal The sands will drown; And when the morning-star amid the pearly Light of the east goes down, Then my star shall arise, and late and early Shine for a jewel in the Master's crown. Mazzini, Master, singer of the sunrise! Knowest thou me? I held thy hand once, and the summer lightning Still of thy smile I see; Me thou rememberest not amidst the heightening Vision of God, and of God's Will to be. But thou wilt hear of me, by noon to-morrow, And henceforth I Shall be to thee a memory and a token Out of the starry sky; And when my soul unto thy soul hath spoken, Enough,‚ÄîI shall not wholly pass nor die. Italia, when thou comest to thy kingdom, Remember me! Me, who on this thy night of shame and sorrow Was scourged and slain with thee; Me, who upon thy resurrection morrow Shall stand among thy sons beside thy knee. Shalt thou not be one day, indeed, O Mother, Enthroned of all, To the world's vision as to ours now only, At Rome for festival; Around thee gathered all thy lost and lonely And loyal ones, that failed not at thy call; With golden lyre, or violet robe of mourning, Or battle-scar;‚Äî And one shall stand more glorious than the others, He of the Morning-Star, Whose face lights all the faces of his brothers, Out of the silvery northern land afar. But grant to me there, unto all beholders, Bare to the skies, To stand with bleeding hands, and feet, and shoulders, And rapt, unflinching eyes, And locked lips, yielding to the question-holders Nor moanings, nor beseechings, nor replies. Is the hour hard? Too soon it will be over, Too sweet, too sore; The arms of Death fold over me with rapture, Life knew not heretofore; Heaven will be peace, but I shall not recapture The passion of this hour, for evermore. BARON GIOVANNI NICOTERA. See note C. Salerno, 1858. Salerno waits amid the heat Of August, for the words of doom.‚Äî Nicotera and eighty men Who followed him are here to meet Award of justice:‚Äîit has come. Follow, and hear the judgment, then. Ergastolo‚Äîan evil name, An evil thing, a hell on earth; Wherein no whisper evermore Of hope shall enter; nor the shame Of stripes, and bonds, and brutal mirth, Be loosed from life, till life is o'er. The judge and prisoner, man to man, Are met together;‚Äîsilent one, With fiery face that in its prime Looks from the prison changed and wan;‚Äî While speaks the other, having done With life, and trembling at the time, ‚ÄòMy time is past: some new time wakes:‚Äî I am an old man, I am weak, I have not seen a face like yours; And, looking on it, my heart breaks For such a doom as I must speak:‚Äî I know no heart of man endures ‚ÄòSuch things as are before you now. I pray you, ere it be too late, To seek some mercy, for the sake Of those that love you, and to bow Unto the world, and kings, and fate:‚Äî You will not bend, but they can break. ‚ÄòYou that are nelpless in their hands, Keep your own heart, but speak some word Of prayer for pardon, and submit To that strong law which stays and stands A rock above the waves unstirred, While you are dashed to death on it, ‚ÄòIn vain, in vain;‚Äîand lives of those That followed you are cast away. For them, for you, there yet is grace If you will have it.‚Äô The tears rose: But answer made Nicotera, Standing together face to face,‚Äî ‚ÄòDomenico, I speak to you, Not as the judge who serveth man, But as the man who serveth God‚Äî God who shall judge between us two:‚Äî I say, I will not, if I can, Retrace one step my feet have trod. You serve your King, and it is well; He hath not failed you at your need, Not yet,‚Äîand you have royal grace. We serve our God‚Äîand you can tell Our wages:‚Äîand if this indeed Were all, you have the better place. ‚ÄòBut we have not been desolate Of such divinest comfortings As hitherto have borne us up; With one inspired Apostolate, One trumpet-voice that round us rings, One sanguine sacramental cup. ‚ÄòAnd having heard and drunk, nowise Can we but triumph, since God's light Hath opened to us‚ÄîItaly! And hath unveiled before our eyes, Far off, and unapproached, and bright, His last dread angel, Liberty. ‚ÄòThe unseen, unborn face of one Even as a mother cherisheth, Who knoweth she shall live to bear A living and most lovely son, And yet must die before his breath Upon her lips makes soft the air,‚Äî ‚ÄòThough now we suffer for her sake, Her living face we shall not see; The throes are come, but not the birth. For we no more shall writhe and wake, And on our graves her foot shall be, When she comes down to reign on earth.‚Äô All day the hammers fast and hard Have riveted on feet and hands The weight of irons they shall wear Through the long dying, and the yard With fettered pairs is filled, and stands Nicotera amongst them there. ‚ÄòFor this that I have brought you to, Children, forgive me ere we part; A font of fire, a whole life's loss: And yet I know that none of you Forgiveth me, but in his heart Blesseth me rather, for this cross. ‚ÄòThrough every hour of painful breath, Henceforth our souls must carve their price; Life's hope is past, life's purpose stays. Better than life, better than death, Is this the living sacrifice: God keep us worthy all our days! ‚ÄòThe earliest martyrs, the unnamed Saints, the forgotten rank and file Of Christ's unconquered soldiery, Under the same fierce suns that flamed On the same bare and blasted isle, Suffered in lifelong constancy. ‚ÄòThe same rocks echo the same clank Of chains, the same taskmaster's stroke, And grind of stone, and anvil's roar: Ye go to drink the cup they drank; And yet they live, their chains are broke, Their martyrdom has long been o'er. ‚ÄòGod be with you! For me, they say, I go, kept back for such a meed As man's heart faileth him to see: Therefore forget me not, but pray The grace be greater than the need; What matter, if God go with me! ‚ÄòNo darkness is so deep, but white Wings of the angels through can pierce; Nor any chain such heaps lies in But God's own hand can hold it light; Nor is there any flame so fierce But Christ Himself can stand therein.‚Äô The sunset comes; the guarded rank Through thronging thousands of the town, Gathered on window, roof, and door, With heavy step, and ceaseless clank, To the dark ship is passing down, That waits to take them from the shore Ah Saints, the bare and bleeding feet! Ah Christ, the bruised and bleeding hands! Ah God, the pallid faces there! One low long sob goes through the street, One passionate curse God understands, One bitter agony of prayer. A dream of liquid colour! lo, The hills that slope into the sea Range back from rose to violet, And melting into indigo, In farthest mountain mystery, Upon the stainless East are set. The fishing-fleet at anchor-hold Leans over, every purple barge, Its purple shadow on the seas; ‚ÄîIn sweeps of silver outward rolled, Till points of pearl upon the marge Set sail for the Hesperides. Midway the Sirens' Islands mark The blue and glassy wave that flows And ebbs within their cavern-line; Lying all cool and lovely-dark Against the cloudless West that glows Through depths of crimson crystalline. But the black hull is closer moored Against the white shore, motionless; All round, the opal flood of light, Beneath the great black shape obscured, Quivers intenser;‚Äîis not this The very gate of Heaven in sight? Not yet, not yet! Another day.‚Äî O, faithful hearts, take this for sign, That as upon your agony, With unmoved faces on their way, Shine through the sunset the divine Lights of Italia's shore and sea,‚Äî Some day, hereafter, ye shall gaze On them through other eyes than these Of dry despair;‚Äîand happy tears Suddenly break forth‚Äî‚ÄòAre the days Ended indeed? The skies and seas Are passing. Past, with all the years. The night has fallen suddenly; A wind comes sighing from the seas; And they are passed beyond our sight. And none Nicotera shall see Henceforth, though he went not with these, He who is shut from life and light. For he who was their Chief and First, Shall suffer chief and first of all. Dark caverns of captivity In many an isle they hold; and worst Of any, rumour can recall, Is Favignana's, out at sea. They say Tiberius hollowed it, The year that Christ from Calvary Looked down, and said ‚ÄòForgive them, Lord.‚Äô It lieth under water, lit By such faint daylight shadowy As down four hundred steps is poured; Down in the heart of naked rock, Below the seas that evermore Sound through the dank and oozing walls; The chains are rusted in the lock, And on the rotting crusted floor The centipede and scorpion crawls. This legend on the tower above Is carved: ‚ÄòSi entra vivo, e Si esce morto.‚Äô But Death waits: And here Nicotera, for love Of Italy, through night and day Endures alone, and expiates. O Master of the mighty hand Who sealest sentence with a kiss, So that thy doomsmen's hearts grow light,‚Äî Is the word true? Shall the faith stand? Is the work worth such woe as this? Can the day recompense the night? Thou sendest forth, and dost not spare, Thy best to meet the tyrant's worst; Thou sowest lives for Seed of Life. O starry-stern through all despair, Straight on thy course as at the first, Where is thine anguish in this strife? The live pain burneth like a lamp Within thy dark eyes passionate, It burneth to the soul away: It saith, ‚ÄòTo me the dungeon-damp, The last farewell, the felon's fate, Were nothing:‚ÄîI know more, and stay. ‚ÄòFacing the foreseen doom ye know, Through flesh and soul's extremity, Fight on, and keep your hearts alive! I have gone through where ye must go, I have seen past the agony, I behold God in Heaven, and strive.</field>
