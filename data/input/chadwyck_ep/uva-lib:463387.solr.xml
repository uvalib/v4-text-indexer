      <field name="fulltext">Iohn Ganon in Commendation of the Author. If Maro who did treate of Mars, And Lucan ciuill warres, If Naso for his wanton verse, And change of men to stars, Possest great praise and endlesse fame, What then deserueth he, That treats of him who brought vs blisse, And bond did make vs free? Whose life he lou'd not as our health, And vs transforms to Angels wealth. Lo let his praise the brasen posts And Pyramis outweare, Nor let not Momus canckred tooth, The worke praise worthie teare: But as the Phœnix shall it liue, Though birth renuing new: And as the fire which waterie thorns, And greene wood doth subdue, Doth flame at length: so maugre spite, It flourish shall to goods delight. Io. Pine in eiusdem. Let fame take now her flight, From place to place, and say, That if men looke to find aright, To life a readie way, Or seeke the sou'raigne pearle, That farre surpasseth gold, They may herein find either well, Sent free to them, not sold. Let him in lue of paine, Reape this reward therefore, That giues what wit (not wealth) did gaine, A name for euermore. The Holie Historie of Our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christs natiuitie, life, actes, miracles, doctrine, death, passion, resurrection and ascension. THE FIRST PART OF THE HISTORIE OF CHRIST OVR SAVIOVR, AS IT IS WRITTEN BY the Euangelists Mathew, Marke, Luke and Iohn. Written in English meeter by R. H. to the tune of the Psal.81. The promised Messiah. Be light, and glad, in God reioyce, Which is our strength and stay, Confesse also with heart and voyce, His goodnesse eu'rie way: Whose promise to the Patriarks past So oft, and long before, God hath performed at the last; To him be praise therefore. His word into the world he sent, By whom he made the same: Who vs to saue, (as then was meant) A perfect man became. Christ is that light, that lightneth all, That in the world do dwell: Of him the deu'll had a tall; He hath vs freed from hell. The Angell Gabriell saluteth the virgine Marie. To Naz'reth Gabriell came from God, A towne in Galilie: Sixe monethes after, (and no odd,) He spoke to Zacharie. To blessed Marie, then he went, A mayde and virgine pure: And said (all haile) to thee is meant, Much happinesse be sure. The Lord thy God, hath thought it good, That thou shalt beare his sonne: Which when she heard and vnderstood, She said his will be donne. I nothing doubt what thou hast said, But do the same beleeue: No fond conceipt shall cause men feare, All thankes to God I geue. Marie visiteth her cosin Elizabeth. When he was gone from her away, Most ioyfull, and most glad The virgin was, to see that day, And here the newes she had. Straightway she thence went hastily, Her cosin for to see: They did reioyce most hartily, Such mothers both to bee. Ioseph disposed to leaue Marie, was satisfied by an Angell, and so tooke her. But this amazed Iosephs minde, That was a man so iust: He thought his spouse had bene vnkind, And had abus'd his trust. Yet when he meant to shift away With her, his worldly shame: An Angell warnde him where he lay, And then he tooke the dame. The taxing of the world vnder Aug. Cæsar. And in Augustus Cæsars raigne, When all the world so wide, He so commanding, this is plaine, Was taxt on eu'ry side. Cirenius ouer Syria, Was gouernour also: When to be taxt in Iudea, They thither both did go. With Marie, his espoused wife, From Nazareth he came: To Bethlehem; to lead his life, To answere to the same. Of Dauids house and line they weare, And therefore thought it good: Among all such their taxe to beare, As were of Dauids blood. The birth of Christ in Bethlehem. While they were there her dayes were donne, Her child-bearing did hye: So she brought forth, and bare a sonne; Such was their pouertie, A stable roome they onely had, This heau'nly babe to lay: Whose birth hath made so many glad, Within a cratch of hay. His clothes were clouts, they wrapt him in, And layd in cratch he was: Although his weedes were very thin, Betweene an Oxe and Asse. Thus poorely came our mighty king, into the world so vaine: Without all pompe, our prince did bring His people out of paine. Christ, our Messiah, God and man, Borne of a virgin pure, Contented (though no princes can, Such pouertie endure:) For kingly court, with stable was, For bed of Downe, with hay: A while in manger by an Asse, The king of kings he lay. An Angell declareth to the sheapheards the birth of Christ, and they are made witnesses of it. His birth the Lord did first bewray, To shepheards poore and base: Which day and night in field did stay, Their flocke of sheepe to grase. An Angell came most gloriouslie, Vnto those silly men, Saluting them, (though gratiouslie) Yet were they fearefull then. Let not your mindes be so affraid, For tidings of great ioy I bring to you: the Angell said, Nothing shall you annoy. All people may reioyce at this, And praise their God for aye: For Christ the Lord is borne iwis, in Bethlehem this day. And this (as signe) you shall espie, The sauiour shall be laid, All swadled, in a cratch to lie, In poorest sort araid. Disdaine not you his pouertie, The Sauiour is the same; He will his saue most certainly, From euerlasting blame. Then with the Angell straightway were, A multitude surely: Of heauenly souldiours, praising there One God in trinitie. All glorie be to God on high, And in the earth be peace, And towards men continually, Good will may still increase. So when the Angels all were gone, To heau'n melodiouslie: The shepheards of their newes anone Would trie the veritie. They went, and saw what they had heard, And published the same: All wondred at what they declarde, Though few beleeu'd the fame. They praising God, not now affraid, Did thence againe depart: But Marie kept what they had said, And pondred in her heart. For she brought foorth the Lord, the Prince, The prophet, and the priest: That did the diuell, and death conuince, Our Sauiour Iesus Christ. The Circumcision of Christ. When eight dayes were accomplished, Because they stood in awe: The child was then Circumcised, According to the law. Then Iesus was he calde by name, His friends ordaining so: Because the Angell will'd the same, To Ioseph long ago. The wisemen, the first fruite of the Gentiles, came from the East and worshipped Christ. Next, after this came from the East, The wisemen by a starre: To see this babe; for euer bleast, The wisemen came so farre. In Herods dayes these wisemen came, And asked (him) this thing: We saw his starre, yet heard no fame, Of Christ your Prince and King. Where is he borne? that we may see, And worship him they say? King Herod, what is knowne to thee, Declare without delay. This troubled all Hierusalem, (as it had done the King:) Yet many knew in Bethlehem, Should be this child-bearing. But Herod fearing his estate, So doubtfull to endure: Did of this matter much debate, His Crowne it was not sure. Therefore, he sent the men away, To search where Christ should be: That Christ (saith he) without delay, May worship't be by me. Now as the chiefe Priests, Scribes, and rest, Had therein taught to them: The wisemen so were ready prest, To go to Bethlehem, Yet warned by the king they were, To make returne againe: Thereby he thought, to end his feare, When he the child had slaine. So they depart, and loe the starre, Which they had seene before: (By which they had now iourneyd farre, And were to trauaile more,) Did still direct them in their way, Each day by day and night, Till they had seene (it did not stray,) The onely Lord of might. Whom, when they found, they fell downe flat, To worship him, and these Gaue to him treasures, each one what Each one of them did please. Or as their countrey yeelded then, They vnto him did bring Gold, incense, mirrhe: those sage wisemen, Did offer to that king. And so being warned in a night, (For God an Angell sent) Another way with all their might, They to their countrey went. Then they perceiu'd, that Herods drifts, Was onely him to slay: Whom they adored with their gifts, Therfore they went their way. Christ was presented in the temple at Ierusalem: where Simeon and Anna witnessed of him. Marie purified according to the law. When Maries daies were finished, Full thirtie daies and three: She afterward was purified, As women wont to be. And then the child they did present, Meekely before the Lord: For to Ierusalem then went, His friends with one accord. This was a law they did obserue, The first that opened The mothers wombe; they did reserue To God as hallowed. And offer'd an oblation, Of turtle Doues a paire, Or pigeons young: this portion They would not sure appaire. Then Simeon surnamed iust, That long had liued there: For Israels comfort he did trust, He liu'd of God in feare. The holy Ghost him this foretold, No death shall dint on thee, The Lord his Christ (though thou art old) Before thou surely see. He then into the temple came, When Iesus there was brought: And speaking plainly of the same, As in his minde he thought, Said, Lord, now lettest thou in peace, Thy seruaunt to depart: According to thy promise, ease Is hapned to my hart. For with mine eyes, I sure haue seene, Saluation sent by thee: And in mine armes, thy sonne hath beene, That workes the same for me. Him thou prepared hadst before, To be the Gentiles light: And eke to Israell euermore, Their glory and their might. Then Ioseph and his mother milde Did maruaile much, to heare The wordes he spake there of the child, And pondred them with feare. Yet Simeon blessing them, could say, Oh Marie be content, This fall to many, is the stay, To Israell was meant. Old Anna was a Prophetesse, Which prayed day and night: This likewise did the child confesse, To be the Gentiles light. She came by chance, the same to see, That she so much desirde, The rites, performed orderly, They home-wardes all retir'de. Ioseph warned of an Angell flieth into Egipt. After all this; was Ioseph warnde, That he should take the child, And mother; then, all three vnharmde, Least they should be beguilde. For Herod, as the Angell said, Would seeke to take his life: Wherefore to Egipt all affrayd, Went Ioseph and his wife. The infants slayne. Herod (as mockt) did take a scorne, And in his angrie moode, Slue infants all in Bethlehem borne, And spilt their guiltlesse blood. The children there of two yeares old, Or vnder as they were; He slue them all; his act was bold, It wanted grace and feare. This act was foretold long before, In Ieremie we reade, That Rachell she should so deplore, Her children being dead. Which was accomplished in deed, By Herod in his ire: Who made so many infants bleed, Yet mist of his desire. For Christ was gone from thence away, To Egipt to remaine: Whence he till Herods dying day, Did not returne againe. That it which earst the Prophet said, Might certainly be donne: I out of Egipt vnaffrayd, Haue called backe my sonne. Ioseph warned againe by an Angell, returneth out of Egipt, after the death of Herod. When Christ was now full fiue yeares old, And had in Egipt beene Two yeares or more, as authors hold, The Angell there was seene, To warne Iosephus thence to come, Againe to Israell: And bring his wife, and sonne, (as some Supposed) there to dwell. For now they were both dead and gone, That sought the child his life: Then he and his supposed sonne Returned and his wife. But Archelaus Herods sonne, That held his fathers place, Made Ioseph thinke they were vndonne, He doubted of his grace. He went and turned then aside, Another part vnto, Of Galilie; there to abide, As he was wild to do. In Nazareth he did remaine, That it might come to passe: What earst the Prophets verie plaine Foretold: and so it was. Iesus being twelue yeares old disputeth with the elders in the Temple at Ierusalem. His parents yeare by yeare they went, Their passeouer to hold: And did the same with like intent, When Christ was twelue yeares old. They to Ierusalem did go, And there abode the dayes Appointed for that feast; no mo, For then they went their wayes. Yet Christ the Lord abode behind, Whom they with sorow sought Three dayes, not knowing well his mind, What then our Sauiour thought. For he began to set abroch The businesse he had: Who did perceiue the time approch, To make his chosen glad. Among the Doctors as he taught, And posed them withall, His parents found him, that were fraught With griefe vnto the gall. Yet were they easd; and pleasd to heare Each one to geue him prayse: Though hey had sought their sonne with feare, And sorow sundry wayes. Then he againe obediently, To Nazareth did come: And seru'd his parents reu'rently, Most like a louing sonne. And he increasd in stature so, In wisedome, and in grace With God and men, where he did go, That happie was the place. Sixe things specially to be noted in this first part of the Historie. Sixe things, we may especially, In this part marke and see: Pertaining to Christes infancy, As authors do agree. 1 First, of what line Christ Iesus came: He was of Dauids seede, 2 The holy Ghost conceiu'd the same That Marie bore in deede. 3 The wisemen thirdly, came to see, And seeke to finde a king: 4 Then found, confest him so to be, For whom they treasure bring. Fourthly, by flight Christ scapeth sure, King Herods heauie hand: 5 For him, the infants death indure, When Christ had left the land. 6 Sixtly, being warnd to come againe, For sundry causes good, From Egipt where they did remaine, Iosephus past the flood, And came to lurie for to dwell, Thus tossed cruellie, Was Christ the king of Israell, From his weake infancie. Thus did our good and louing God, Send downe his onely sonne: To saue vs sinners from his rod, That else had bene vndonne. There was no merites left for man, His sillie soule to saue; But onely this, Christ onely can, Reuiue vs in the graue. This Christ at the appointed time, Tooke flesh, of Adams seede: Whose substance was but earthie slime, This flesh, he tooke in deede. And in this flesh, that did offend, This second Adam hee Did all our former faults amend, And fully made vs free. As many as vnfainedly Beleeue and say the same, They finde saluation certainly, In Iesus Christ his name. Therefore be glad, in God reioyce, He is our strength and stay: Be ioyfull, and lift vp your voyce, To Iacobs God alway. Amen. THE SECOND PART OF THE HISTORIE OF OVR LORD AND SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST, containing those things which he did the first yeare after his Baptisme: which was the xxx. of his age, according to the foure Euangelistes. To the tune of the Lordes Prayer. Christ Baptized the time when, and where he was Baptized. Christ, thirtie yeares of age at lest, Began to preach the Gospell then: Our sauiour Christ, was ready prest, To bring glad tydings vnto men: But ere he would this enterprise, In Iordan, Iohn did him Baptise. Tiberius Cæsar as we read, Then raigned full the fifteenth yeare: Iudea Pylate rulde as head. In Galilie, it doth appeare, That Herod raigned in the place: And in Iturea Phillip was. Lysanias ruled Abylen, Annas and Cayphas high Priests were: Th' Euangelistes agree that then, Iohn preached and Baptized there. Among the rest, he did Baptise Our Sauiour Christ, but on this wise. Christ Iesus came from Galilie, To Iordan, where Iohn did Baptise: Iohn Christ fore-running certainly, His office did well exercise With diligence, whose time then came, To yeeld to Christ, and leaue the same. With water I Baptise, said he, Mens liues t'amend I teach the way: But he that commeth after me, To Baptise his, will not delay, With fire and with the holy Ghost, To whom I yeeld; his might is most. Therefore, when Christ Baptisde would be, Iohn put him backe, and said, I need To haue thy helpe, com'st thou to me? Christ said againe, we must in deed, Both thus all righteousnesse fulfill: Then Iohn obeyd Christ Iesus will. Christ needed not at all to haue This badge of penitence: but he That meant his chosen for to saue, Most humble showes himselfe to be. Christ Baptisme did receiue therefore, That he might honour it the more. When Christ out of the water went, Straightway the heau'ns were opened: Iohn saw the same incontinent, Assoone as it then happened, The holy Ghost, Iohn like a doue, Did see descending from aboue. He heard withall from heau'n this voyce, This is my welbeloued sonne, In whom I onely do reioyce, By him my will is truly donne; The Father, Sonne, and Spirite he Then heard, and saw, at once all three. The voyce, and sight, Iohn heard, and sawe, Assured him, that this was he, Of whom, all men should stand in awe, By whom, all men must saued be. He that sent Iohn for to Baptise, Said, thou shalt see him in such wise. Iohn then, discharging well his place, Was glad in heart to leaue the same, And yeeld to Christ, so full of grace; Of whom he published the fame. I came before, said Iohn, to tell, And spread his name in Israell. Christ by the spirite was lead into the wildernesse where he fasted forty dayes and 40 nights. After all this, the spirite lead Christ Iesus, to the wildernesse: Where he troad downe the Serpents head, To bring vs out of heauinesse. There first, he did both pray and fast, While fortie dayes and nights did last. Among wild beasts he liued then, This was his comfort all those dayes: (So farre from companie of men,) In prayer to talke with God alwayes. Christ thus with reu'rent care did take, In hand his office for our sake. But after that those dayes were donne, To show him perfect man to be, An hungred was Gods onely sonne, Though farre from foode as then was he. The tempter thought this place most fit And time to ply his wilie wit. Christ was tempted of the deuill three wayes, and thrise himselfe ouercome by Christ. He like himselfe, is alwayes found Most false, and faine would Christ deceiue: This first demaund he did propound, (As doubting (though he did perceiue) That Christ the sonne of God should bee; And tryes it with deuises threee.) First, to dispaire he Christ would bring, As then to doubt of helpe at need: His wants he knew, and vrg'd that thing, If thou be Christ, Gods sonne in deed, Command these stones made bread to bee: For other foode I can not see. Christ answereth, man doth not liue By bread alone, as thou doest deeme, Gods word is bread, which I beleeue Doth feede all his, this I esteeme. By it, mans life preserued is: I will not tempt my God in this. Then next, the deuill deuised so From doubt, to confidence as vaine, Christ to prouoke, they both thence go The temple to, from top againe Sathan willd Christ to take a fall: Angels will aide thee if thou call. For this is written sure, said he, That God hath charg'de them so to do, If thou doest fall, then shall I see, And shew it vnto many moe. Thus did the deu'll Gods word abuse: Which God hath willd vs well to vse. Christ said againe, this written is, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God: Who so doth so, deserueth this, For such a fault, to feele his rod. I will not so deceiued be: Depart therefore, thou deu'll from me. Lastly, by wealth and worldly gaine, The subtil'st shift of all the rest Man to deceiue, whose minde is vaine, This wile as then the deuill addrest, To tempt our Sauiour Christ withall: Not doubting him therewith to fall. He brought him to a mountaine high, These worldly kingdomes to behold: The deuill was in his maiestie, This act of his was verie bold. All these (said he) will I giue thee, If thou fall downe and worship me. But Iesus could no more abide, To heare him vaunt so much amisse: Christ did conuince him then of pride, To offer him that was not his. Voyde Sathan; get thee hence away: Worship the Lord; thy God obay. You see therefore Christ Iesus was So by the spirite led away: He fasted, in a desert place. He practis'd prayer day by day, And Sathans sleights did ouerthrow, All this the Scripture, doth vs show. And in that he was tempted so, And suffered: S.Paule doth say, He is well able to helpe mo, That tempted are by any way. We need not therefore stand in feare, When we do call, Christ will giue eare. Though Sathan, had three drifts diuisde, By fraud our Sauiour Christ to foyle: Yet naked then, and all disguisde, He gained shame for his great toyle. Three wayes he tempted Christ withall, And thrice himselfe he had the fall. This conquest of th' infernall foe, Christ Iesus made ere he began In open sight himselfe to shoe, The Sauiour of mortall man. That his might euermore boldly, The deuill and all his workes dofie. When Sathan felt his force, he flead, And left Christ Iesus all alone: The womans seede, on Serpents head In his good time, did tread vpon, And then the Angels to him came, To be as witnesse of the same. Iohns testimonie of Christ. While Christ was in the wildernesse, And vnreturned backe againe, The Scripture plainly doth expresse, That idle Iohn did not remaine. The Iewes sent to him, for to see, They thought him sure that Christ to be. But Iesus he confest to be, Before him, and his greater to: All grace in him receiued we, Said he, and so all faithfull do. The law by Moses giuen was: By Iesus Christ came truth and grace. God was not seene of any man, His sonne hath him declared sure: Which best and onely do it can, And doth both God and man endure. Which in the fathers bosome still Doth rest, and knoweth all his will. One day ere Christ came backe againe, To Bethabara where they were, The Priests and Leuites answer plaine Of Iohn receiue, backe home to beare. What art thou, they to Iohn did say? Tell vs, let vs go hence away. Confessing, he did not deny, That Christ whom ye suppose I am, I am not he assuredly. Tell whom thou doest thy selfe then name? Art thou Elias? no said he. Whom makest thou thy selfe to be? Art thou that Prophet? Iohn said no. What art thou then the Leuites say? Giue answer now and let vs go, So answer others that we may. For hither they for this intent, Vs from Ierusalem haue sent. I surely am (said Iohn) the voyce, That in the wildernesse doth cry, Vnto all such as do reioyce, That their redemption is nye. Make straight the pathes, prepare the way, Of God the Lord, without delay. They which were sent were Pharisies, They asked him then, thus againe, Why Baptisest thou now all these, If thou be none of both those twaine? That Christ, nor yet Elyas he; How can this worke agree with thee? Iohn said, with water I Baptise, But there doth stand among you one, Whom ye acknowledge in no wise, For all that I to you haue donne: He was before me, and his shoes, I am not worthie to vnloose. These things in Bethabara were So donne, as you do heare the same: For Iohn Baptised euen there, As many then as to him came: And Christ returned the next day, When Iohn had sent those men away. At Christs returne, Iohn sure said this, Forthwith as Iesus came that way, Behold, the lambe of God it is, That commeth here, this man I say, He of this world, and all therein, Away will onely take the sinne. Iohn the 17. of February, An. mundi 4170. sent Disciples to Christ, this was Iohn Baptist. A few dayes after this was donne, Christ as before then passing by, Behold, said Iohn, here is the sonne, And lambe of God assuredly. This his Disciples heard him say, And two of them went straight away. Andrew and Iohn were the same twaine, That follow'd Christ, to them said he, What seeke ye? where doest thou remaine Rabbi, said they? he said come see. They went and saw, and both did stay With Christ our Sauiour all that day. His brother Simon Andrew found, And brought to Christ, to whom Christ gaue Cephas to name, which men expound To be a stone, and this we haue To note, that as his name so was, His faith for firmnesse it would passe. In this discourse, well may we see, As Iohn, so his, themselues did show, Most willing, that all men might be Brought the Messiah for to know, To Christ Iohn sent such as he wonne, For then he knew his time was donne. In Christes returne to Galilie, He finding Phillip by the way, Said, follow me: he presentlie Christes call most humbly did obay; This Phillip of Bethsaida was, And Andrew also of that place. Then Phillip found Nathanaell, And said the Sauiour is heare: The onely king of Israell, A Nazarite he doth appeare. Can any good come, I pray thee, From Nazareth (Phillip) said he? Then Phillip said, come thou and see. When Iesus saw Nathanaell, Oh Israelitie, no guile in thee, Or deepe deceipt (said he) doth dwell. Whence know'st thou me, said he againe? I neuer saw thee, this is plaine. Then Iesus said, I did thee see, Ere Philip came and calde thee thence, When thou wast vnder the figge tree. Nathanaell said in their presence, Gods sonne thou art, I see it well, And eke the king of Israell. Because I said so, vnto thee, Said Iesus to Nathanaell; I saw thee vnder the figge tree, Beleeuest thou? thou doest well. Thou shalt see greater things then these: Thy plainnesse, me said Christ, doth please. Hereafter, shall ye verely, The heau'ens see open all aboue, And Angels comming certainly, Vpon his sonne, whom God doth loue. Ascending and descending they, The sonne of man will all obey. The first miracle that Christ wrought was in Cana in Bonauentura Galilie at the mariage, as some suppose of Iohn the Euangelist, turning water to wine. In Cana was a mariage made, (This Cana was in Galilie,) Three dayes after Phillip had Bene cald of Christ so louingly: And eke Nathanaell also: Or after Christ did thither go. Marie vnto the mariage came, So Christ withall was bidden there, And his Disciples to the same, As Iohn reportes, all called were. Of miracles the first this was, That Christ then wrought in the same place. But Marie there presumed so, That Christ gaue her a grieuous checke; In thought man may not God out-go, Prescribe not him, obey his becke. They haue no wine (oh sonne) said she: Oh what haue I to do with thee? He turned yet (as he before Had with himselfe in mind decreed) Sixe water pots (to mend their store) Of water full, to wine in deed. And shew'd his glorie, that he might So strength their faith, that saw the sight. Christ went from Cana to Capernaum. From Cana to Capernaum he, His mother, and his brethren went: Because he there vsde oft to be, To leaue his mother there he meant. For it would wearie her to go From place to place, though Christ did so. For her Christ Iesus did prouide, (To teach vs all the like to do,) Where he was wont for to abide, And liked of the place also, For where his mother placed he, His Citie, it was namde to be. Yet there (as then) he taried not, But verie shortly went away, For nothing could make him forgot, Or then his fathers workes delay, The more he car'de for his in deed, He did the more about this speed. Christ went thence to Ierusalem to the feast of the passeouer, and there droue the buyers and sellers out of the Temple. From Capernaum Christ did go, Vp to Ierusalem; for he, As other, alwayes vsed so, Not sayling, at that feast to be. The passeouer was then at hand, A feast obserued through the land: When Christ came there, as he did vse, Into the Temple then he went, Where he reprouing their abuse, All such out of the Temple sent, As did therein then buy or sell, And told them plaine they did not well. A whip of cordes Christ Iesus made, Wherewith both oxen, sheepe and men, He droue out, he low'd there no trade, No not money strangers then, Those thence he forst to packe away, And suffred none of them to stay. Such as sold doues, they had a check, He did command them quickly thence; Perforce they must obey his beck, He not regardes their ware or pence, But said my fathers house make ye, No house of marchandise to be. They were amazed all at this, Yet none of them durst disobay, Resist, or say thou doest amisse, They yeelded all and went away. But his Disciples thought in mind, This zeale God ioyes in him to find. When this was donne, the Iewes began To question with him thus againe: What signe shew'st thou? oh sonne of man, That thou doest this? declare it plaine: Destroy this Temple, in three dayes, The same againe I will vp raise. The Temple sixe and thirtie yeares In building was; thus answer they, This vnto vs no truth appeares, That did thy wordes and workes obey. They meant the Church of lyme and stone, Christ meant his body, flesh and bone. When he was risen from the dead, Then his Disciples cal'de to mind What he foretold, and how he spread, A truth in him they still did find, The ground of their beliefe, they make The Scripture; and the word he spake. While he did at that feast remaine, Many beleeued in his name: They saw his workes, they were not vaine, His wonders wanted not their fame. He gaue to them no credit then: For he knew well that vaine were men. Christ instructeth Nicodemus in the regeneration by water and the holy Ghost. There was a man, a Pharisie, A ruler, one of chiefest fame, Nam'd Nicodemus verely: This man by night to Iesus came. He had a minde for to amend, Yet men he feared to offend. Master he said, we know thou art, A teacher come from God aboue: Such signes and workes none can impart, But such a one as God doth loue. Those miracles that he had donne: Approued him to be Gods sonne. Said Iesus, I do say to thee, Except a man be borne againe, Of water and the spirite, he Shall not Gods kingdome sure obtaine. Can this be true, as thou hast told, May man be borne that once is old? Assuredly, except a man Be borne as I haue said to thee: Heauen be neuer enter can, Gods kingdome he shall neuer see. Of flesh, but flesh is borne ywis: The spirite yeeldes that spirite is. Thou know'st not whence commeth the wind, Whose going in and out to thee, Though by thine eare the sound thou find, The seate thereof thou doest not see. Who of the spirite is borne heare, Is so, though strange it doth appeare. Nicodemus said, how can these things be. A teacher greater things should know, I testifie that I haue seene, When earthly things to thee I show, If dull and faithlesse thou hast bene; What wilt thou be, when I declare Of heau'nly things? and what they are. No man ascendeth vp aboue, But he that did descend from thence: The sonne of man, whom God doth loue, And is in heau'n in his presence. He must be lift, as by Moses The Serpent was in wildernesse. That who so doth in him beleeue, Eternall life the same may haue: For God his onely sonne did giue, The faithfull from hell fire to saue. The world to saue Gods sonne was sent: It to condemne God was not bent. Condemned shall he neuer be, That doth beleeue in him, the same Condemned is already he, Whose faith is not firme in his name. The light is come, yet darknesse more Do worldly men loue, then before. The euill euer hate the light, By it their deeds reproued are, He loues the truth, that with his might His deedes by day seekes to declare. Oh Nicodemus, all I say, A faithfull heart must beare away. Christ returning into Iudea preached the Gospell, and Baptised the people by his Disciples neare Iohn, of purifying a question did then arise. After this donne, came Christ againe, With his Disciples as we reade, Into Iudea, this is plaine, Where he Baptising taried, Iohn did Baptise in Enon by, And ply'de his office carefully. Of water there they had great store, And Iohn was not in prison cast, But as the number waxed more, Of Disciples, strife grew as fast, The Iewes, and Iohns Disciples, craue Of purifying the truth to haue. Iohns testimonie againe of Iesus. They also came to Iohn, and said, Most men to Christ (Baptising) go. Iohn bad them be no whit dismayd, From heau'n it is appointed so: Ye know, I said, I am not he; Christ must increase, as you do see. He that is come from God on hye, Doth testifie what he hath seene, He that receiues it, verely, Doth seale how true our God hath beene, Whom God sent, speakes Gods word, Iohn saith, And plenteously Gods spirite hath. The Father lou'd the sonne, and gaue All things he had into his hand, He that beleeues in him shall haue Eternall life, this vnderstand, They dead are that him disobay, The wrath of God all such will slay. Iesus to auoyde danger departed out of Iudea into Galilie. When he, that knew of all things well, Perceiued by relation, Or of himselfe, for he could tell His enemies intention, How that the Pharisies did heare, That he was famous eu'ry wheare: And that he made Disciples more, And more Baptised then likewise, Then Iohn, that had gone him before. Marke ye now well Christ Iesus guise, He did his office earnestly, Yet voyded danger warily. Christ passing through Samaria towardes Galilie, conferred with a woman at the well of Sichar: and conuerted many Samaritanes. Christ leauing Iurie, did depart, And went againe to Galilie, He knew what loue or hate in heart Men bare him hidden outwardly, Christ through Samaria needs would go, He had himselfe decreed so. What workes for him did there abide, To bring the Gentiles to the light, He did foreknow, and then did guide His companie to Sichar right, Neare to the place that Iacob gaue, Where Ioseph should possession haue. And there on faithfull Iacobs well, Christ Iesus sate about midday: A woman, that thereby did dwell, For water came while he did stay. But his Disciples they were gone, Into the Citie, eu'ry one. Then to the woman Iesus said, For me to drinke some water giue: So she againe then vndelayd, Said, thou a Iew art I beleeue; Iewes with Samaria disagree, And water askest thou of me? Then Iesus said, oh woman, see: If thou the gift of God didst know, And who it is that asketh thee, Thou woldest not then seeme so slow, To aske of him, for he can giue Water of life, if thou beleeue. The woman said, the well is deepe, And thou hast nought to draw withall: Where doest thou then thy water keepe? Or doest of me for water call? This well our father Iacob gaue, Whose name in reu'rence here we haue. Art thou greater then Iacob was? He dranke of it, and so did then His children, in this very place, His cattell, and his houshold men. But Iesus said, who so doth drinke Of this, will thirst, thou so must thinke. The water I giue, who drinke will, Thirsteth no more while he doth liue, It shall in him be springing still To euerlasting life; this giue That I thirst not, oh sir said she, Nor to draw here more driuen be. Then Iesus said, thy husband call, And come againe with him to me. Husband I haue now none at all, To Iesus then thus answered she. Thou hast well said; thou hast had fiue, This is not thine, that is aliue. Thou art a Prophet I do see: Our fathers worshipt in this mount, But now Ierusalem say ye, To worship in, men most account, The houre is come, now shines the light, Yet here, nor there, ye worship right. Ye worship that ye do not know, We worship that we know and see: Saluation is, I say to you, Come of the Iewes, and now said he, In truth and spirite men haue need, The father to adore in deed. God is a spirite, and they must, In spirite and in truth withall, Worship him, that in him trust, And on his name for mercy call. Messiah comes (said she againe,) And he will teach vs all things plaine. He said to her, lo I am hee; And his Disciples came with that: When Christ so talke with her they see, They all did maruaile much thereat. They of their meate did offer make, But he as then no meat would take. His meat, was to accomplish then His fathers will, and worke to end, The haruest is among all men Most ripe, whereto God did you send: The reaper wages shall receiue, And sower ioy thereof perceiue. Herein the prouerbe true is found, That one doth sow, another reape, You reape where other tild the ground, Their labours all on you I heape. The woman all this while was gone, And left Christ there, though not alone. She went into the Citie then, Come see, said she, one that told me, All I haue done; and straight the men Went out our Sauiour Christ to see; Whom when they saw, they did beleeue, For wordes that she to them did giue. When the Samaritanes were come, They prayed him to tarie there, And he abode (as saith some,) Two dayes with them, and they with feare, When they had heard, and seene also His wordes, and workes, beleeued tho. Then said they to the woman, we Do now beleeue, not for thy sake, But for the wordes, and workes we see, For Christ the Sauiour we him take. So two dayes after, thence he went, To Galilie; for so he ment. Christ passing from Samaria to Galilie, turned aside to Nazareth, where he preached on the Sabboth day, &amp;c. When from Samaria he was gone, To Nazareth he tooke his way, Christ knew what best was to be done, No time he would at all delay: About his fathers worke he went, In which his time he wholy spent. Then to their Sinagogue to preach, Vpon the Sabboth day he came; Esayas booke they did him reach, That he might reade vpon the same. Whereout he taught them what he was, What he should teach, and bring to passe. Christ reproueth the ingratitude of his countreymen: affirming that a Prophet is esteemed least in his owne countrey. His doctrine so astonied some, That they did wonder at his words, Whence doth (say they) this wisedome come? Or who to him these works affoords? Is not that Iosephes sonne (we pray,) The Carpenter, we heard this day? His mother Marie we do call, His brethren be they not with vs? As men amazed were they all, To heare him so that text discusse. Saue in his countrey, then said he, A Prophet sure shall honor'd be. Wherefore he said to them againe; When famine plagued Israell, And they for three yeares wanted rayne, And moneths six, as stories tell, Eliah then was sent to none, Saue in Sarepta vnto one. Oh Israëll, thy leprosie, Was great in Eliseus time, Yet none could find a remedie, But Naaman was cur'de by him. When they heard this it grieu'd them sore, And they deuisde his death therefore. So rising they out thrust him all, And lead him on that verie hill, Where they might geue him such a fall, As might haue pleasde their wicked will. He freely yet from them did go, Escaping for all they could do. Christ went from Nazareth to Cana in Galilie, where he restored the rulers sonne to health, the noble man and all his houshold beleeued. To Cana Christ from Naz'reth came, The Galileans him receiu'd, And ioyfully they did the same, His Godhead there was well perceiu'd, Of water wine he made before, Now one to life he did restore. A ruler, that thereby did dwell, At Capernaum, had a sonne Sore sicke: when he of Christ heard tell, And what he eu'rywhere had donne, He came to Christ, and him did pray, To go with him without delay. His sonne was ready now to dye, Therefore he made the greater hast. Your vnbeliefe assuredly, Doth make you many wordes to wast, But go thy way, thy sonne doth liue. He went, and did Christs word beleeue. And as he iourneyd, by the way, He heard his sonne recouered, And by accompt that houre and day. That Iesus health had promised: So he and his beleeued all, Christ when he will, can thus men call. Christ hearing of Iohns imprisonm?t went to Caperna?, after he called sundry of his Apostles, preached the Gospell in Galilie, and healed the diseased. When Iohn was then imprisoned, Or much about that tyme, I say, Christ went and he inhabited Capernaum; and there did stay: The sea of Zabulon was nye, And Nepthalim assuredly. Esayas Prophecid before, That there the Gentiles should haue light, Whose darknesse still increased more, Vntill of Christ they had a sight, Who doth vnto all that beleeue, Eternall life most freely giue. Christ passing throughout Galilie, As he did walke by the sea side, Apostles called verely, Of such men as did there abide, Poore fisher men without respect, By whom he would his works effect. With whom about from place to place, Throughout all Galilie he went, Heaping on his all gifts of grace, And teaching them with like intent, He made those foolish weaklings rise, For to confound the worldly wise. And as he past, continually He euery where did dayly teach, Their Synagogues to openly He went, the Gospell for to preach. Amend your liues, for now said he, Gods kingdome is at hand you see. He also healed each disease, And sicknesse that the people had, Afflicted folke by him found ease, And eu'ry one of him was glad. When once abroad was spread Christs fame, In multitudes they to him came. From all the regions round about, Those then that had infirmities, As palsie, gripings, or the gowt, Came to him in great companies: And each was eased of his sore, To God alone be prayse therefore. Amen. THE THIRD PART OF THE HISTORIE OF OVR LORD AND SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST, containing those things which he did the second yeare after his Baptisme, which was the xxxj. yeare of his age, according to the foure Euangelistes, the yeare after the creation of the world. 4172. beginning at the Sermon, which Christ made in the mount. Codomannvs. To the tune of the Lordes Prayer, vt sup. Christ did prepare all his in mind, To seeke for treasure vp on hye, In heau'n; where as the godly find, All happinesse eternally, It is not health, wealth, shape, or age, That brings men to the heau'nly stage. Therefore cleane contrary to those, That taught true happinesse to be In earthly things, this heau'nly rose, A sweeter sent hath giuen thee, To trace the tract that leadeth sure, Where happinesse doth still endure. When Christ the multitude did see, A mountaine he went vp into: When he was set, where he would be, To his Disciples he spake tho, 1 The poore in spirite blessed are, A kingdome God did them prepare. 2 Blessed are they that mourne for good, For they shall surely comfort haue, Such to their power ill withstood, And for amendment dayly craue. 3 Blessed are they that meeke are found, The earth they shall inherite round. 4 Blessed are they which suffer thirst, And hunger after righteousnesse: For they (said Christ) shall as the first, Be filled with all happinesse. 5 The mercifull are blessed all, They shall haue mercy when they call. 6 Blessed are all the pure in heart, They shall see God vndoubtedly. 7 Peace makers they play such a part, As pleaseth God assuredly: Blessed are they therefore said he, Gods children they shall called be. 8 Blessed are they, which patiently Do suffer persecution For righteousnesse, they verely Shall after their affliction, Gods kingdome in heauen possesse, For so he will their griefes redresse. 9 When men reuile you most of all, And persecute you for my sake, And falsly speaking ill withall, If patiently you do it take, You shall therefore find happinesse, The salue to ease your heauinesse. Reioyse also, I say, be glad, When they haue done you greatest wrong, You haue no cause for to be sad, In heau'n shall you the Saints among Rewarded be, as were before, The Prophets, whom they grieued sore. Christ contrarie to the opinion of flesh and bloud, and the doctrine of the Philosophers, pronounceth a woe to those whom they thought happie. But woe to them that are rich here, And do therein repose their trust: The day will come it shall appeare, They dearely bought such drosse and dust. True treasure in the heau'ns are found, Each thing corrupteth in the ground. Woe be to you that now are full, For ye shall hunger after this, If you were not exceeding dull, For meate ye would not morgage blisse. Woe be to you that now laugh so, For you shall waile and weepe for wo. Woe be to you whom men do prayse, And speake well of, deseruing ill, When you haue driuen out your dayes, You shall bewray your wicked will: False Prophets were by like deuice, Among your elders, had in price. Christ teacheth his Disciples, and in them all other Ministers, what liues they should leade, seeing they were appointed to be the salt of the earth, and light of the whole world. Next, his Disciples he did teach, What they should be in word and deed, Lest when to others they did preach, They to be taught should stand in need; In life and manners he would haue, Them honest, wise, and very graue. Ye are the salt the earth doth yeeld, If in the salt no sauour be, It doth no good in house or field, Men cast such out of doores we see: As it could salt nothing before, So it cannot be seasoned more. Of all the world ye are the light, A Citie set vpon an hill, Can not be hid, by wile or might; And light a candle no man will, To hide it with a bushell then, When it should giue most light to men. Let your light shine before men so, That your good workes they all may see, Your modest manners where ye go, Example must to others be: Your father that doth sit on hye, In heau'n, see you so glorifie. Christ came to fulfill the law. I am not come for to destroy The law or Prophets, but fulfill, I take in nothing so much ioy, As to obey my fathers will, Till heau'n and earth do all decay, The law shall not be done away. The least commandement exprest Who breakes, and teacheth other so, In heau'n he shall be counted least: The contrarie who so will do, Obseruing them, and teach the same, In heau'n he st[illeg.] receiue a name. I say, except your righteousnesse, Exceede the rigeteousnesse of these, You shall be voyde of happinesse, And heau'n (as they) for euer leese; The Pharisies are verely, Full fraught with all hypocrisie. Christ interpreteth certaine Commandements or Lawes: and first thou shalt not kill, correcting the false interpretations of the Scribes and Pharisies. Here Christ correcteth very well, The doctrine of the Pharisie, Ye haue ofttimes (said he) heard tell, How they expounded sensuallie These wordes, which haue bene said of old, To kill another be not bold. Who so (say they) doth kill, shall be By iudgement therefore punished, But marke what I say vnto thee, Without cause who so is moued (Against his brother) angerly, Is subiect to iudgement thereby, Who Racha saith his brother to, By counsell shall be punished, Take heede therefore before ye do, Ye may hereby be terrified, Who so his brother foole will call, In daunger of hell fire doth fall. With hand, with hart, and so in word, We often spill our neighbours life, The hand doth vse to weild a sword, The heart deuiseth bate and strife, And wordes when one disdainful, Reuileth as an enemy. Christ would haue men to reconcile them selues one to another. The greedy Pharisies, they say, That offrings and oblations please, Which now men offer day by day, Yet no man knowes his owne disease. I say, who doth his brother hate, His gift is naught, and worse his state. If to the altar thou do bring, Thy gift remembring some offence, Against thy brother the lest thing, Leaue there thy gift departing thence, Go reconcile thy selfe againe, Thine offring then is not in vaine. Agree while thou art in the way With him that is at strife with thee, Lest to the iudge without delay, Deliuered by him thou be: If Sergeant thee in prison set, Thence, till thou pay, thou shalt not get. Of Adultery. It was of old time, also said, Commit not thou adultery. But I say, looke you be affrayd, To gaze on women lustfully. Who so doth so, doth for his part, Commit adult'rie in his hart. If thy right eye, or hand offend, Plucke out, or cut, and cast away, For it is to a better end, One member perish and decay, Then all thy body thou know'st well, Should wholly so be cast to hell. Of Diuorcement. It hath bene said, who so had sent His wife away, he giuing her A letter of their diuorcement, Had not bene then an offender; Except the wife a whore be found, To liue with her, the man is bound. Who so commits adultery, The man or woman doth amisse, And for that fault may verely, Diuorced be as reason is: No such offender may therefore, While th' other liues, match any more. Of Othes. Againe of old they did forbid, Forswearing, for the same is ill, Of othes each man his house should rid, So to obay Iehouahs will. Othes rightly made do not delay, For to performe the same alway. But otherwise sweare not at all, No not by heau'n the throne of God, Nor by the earth, for so ye fall In danger to deserue his rod. Nor by Ierusalem, for this, The Citie of the king it is. Nor by thine head, thou canst not make, One haire thereof as blacke or white, Most vaine are they that othes do take, And vaine those that in othes delight, Let ye and nay declare your will, What so is more doth come of ill. Of Reuenge. Reuenge not though the law be so, That eye or tooth must be repayde; When one doth smite thee as a foe, Vse patience, be not dismay'd. And he that for thy coate will sue, Giue him thy cloake, and more then due. If one compell thee for a myle, Do thou at least go with him twaine; The asker do thou not reuile, Giue thou and lend without disdaine; To do men good be ready still, And slow to do thy neighbour ill. Loue thine enemie. Loue thou (say they) thy neighbour well, Thine enemy thy selfe may hate, Of vertues, loue, doth all excell, What so the Pharisies do prate, Your enemies loue not the worse, And blesse you them that do you curse. Do good to them that do you hate, Pray for them that you persecute: They sure shall haue a blessed state, My fathers will that execute: He makes his sunne and rayne to fall, On good and bad; alike to all. If man do loue, or frendly be To him, that doth to him the same, What thankes for that deserueth he? Each sinner must do this for shame. Haue you therefore regard of this, Be perfit as your father is. Almes. By sound of trumpe, and in mens sight, As hypocrites are wont to do, To giue thine almes is not aright, They gape for prayse, and get no mo. In secret giue what God hath sent, God will reward thy good intent. Prayer. Pray not as hypocrites do pray, All open to be seene of men; But when thy prayers thou will say, Shut close in chamber be thou then: Pray to thy father secretly, He will reward thee openly. Much babling see thou do not vse, Nor repetitions, they are vaine, The heathen hope for like abuse, Some great reward thereby to gaine. Be not like them, for God in deed, Before ye aske, doth know your need. The Lordes Prayer. Pray thus when ye do pray therefore; Our father which in heauen art. Thy name be hallow'd euermore, Thy kingdome we desire in hart, Thy will in earth make vs to do, As it in heau'n is, euen so. Giue vs this day our dayly bread, Our debtes forgiue vs we thee pray, As we our debters do: and lead Vs not (Oh Lord) by any way Into temptation, but see, From euill we deliu'red be. For thine (good Lord) the kingdome sure, The power and the glorie is, For euermore for to endure, Which liuest in eternall blisse. Let this be done (oh Lord) we pray In heart, whereto Amen we say. To forgiue one another. If ye mens trespasses forgiue, Your heau'nly father will againe Forgiue you yours: you while you liue, In loue and concord must remaine. If you forgiue not other men, Your faultes God will not forgiue then. Fast. Moreouer when that ye do fast, Looke not sowre, as the hypocrite, That time as vayne, they vainly wast, For God therein hath no delite, Their faces they disfigure to, That men may see what then they do. When thou doest fast, annoint thy head, And let thy face then washed be: Seeme not to men as one halfe dead, Let God thy deedes in secret see. Thy heau'nly father, both regards Thy fast, and theirs, haue their rewards. The carefull seeking of worldly things forbidden. On earth hoord vp no treasure so, Where moath and canker eate apace: Lest with them you do heape on woe. There theeues (men voyde of better grace) Breake vp, thus they for riches deale, When digging through, m?s wealth they steale. But lay your treasures vp aboue, In heau'n; where none of these are found: You on your treasures set your loue, Lay not your loue so on this ground. But lay it where is no decay: Earth will corrupt and fade away. The eye, doth giue the body light, And reason rules the inner man: If cleare and sound remaine the sight, No darknesse hurt that body can. If thine eye wicked be, then marke, Sure all thy body shall be darke. Two masters, well, no man can serue: For truly he the one will hate, And for the other loue reserue: This of mans life is right the state. God and your riches, disagree: They may not both, then serued be. Set not your care on meate and drinke, Nor yet on your apparell so: You with your selues must alwayes thinke, That howsoeuer here ye go, He that gaue life and body, will Prouide you meate and clothing still. The fowles of heau'n, ye may behold, To sow or reape they haue no care: They neither want, nor suffer cold, Much better farre then them ye are. Your heau'nly father feedeth these: And so will you, if you him please. Which of you can by taking care, One cubite ad vnto his length? Clothing you know what things they are, Who giueth them and giueth strength. Learne of the lyllies how they grow, To spinne or carde they do not know. Yet Salomon, to you I say, Was not aray'd like one of thease. The grasse if God do so aray, Can he not cloth you if he please? The faithfull neuer fayle to speed: God more regards you then a weed. For meate, for drinke, for cloth alway, Take ye no thought at all therefore: The Gentiles seeke these day by day, Your heau'nly father euermore Will all your wants relieue in deed: He knoweth well what things ye need. Gods kingdome, if ye do seeke first, You can not wish but you shall haue. If for his righteousnesse ye thirst, He will giue you, the things you craue. Care not then for to morow day, The griefe with it shall passe away. Christ forbiddeth rash iudgement. Iudge not lest that ye iudged be, Like iudgement you shall haue be sure: Like measure shall be measur'd thee, Looke that thine eye be cleare and pure; A moate in others do not spye, While that a beame is in thine eye. Holie things may not be giuen to dogges. Giue not to dogges, that holy is: Nor cast your pearles before the swine. The wicked they regard not this, And Epicures to lust incline. When vnder feete they them haue tread: They will not rest till you be dead. Aske, seeke, knocke. Aske, and it shall you giuen be: So they that seeke shall surely find: Knocke, I will open vnto thee: To them that call God he is kind, He loueth such men verely, As pray vnto him hartily. If you for bread, giue not a stone, Nor for a fish, a Serpent send, When that your sonnes for want do mone, If good things you do giue and lend; How much more shall the father be, Giue good things (if thou aske) to thee? The scope of the Scripture, and of the strait and wide gate. What you would men to you should do, Do euen so to them againe: The strait gate enter in vnto, The way to death is broad and plaine, And many find that path (I say) But few do go the better way. False Prophets. False Prophets flye with all your might, Whose clothing pleade simplicitie: But inwardly their minds are dight, With rau'ning and all villanie. Such by their fruites ye may well know: For grapes on thornes did neuer grow. The good and euill tree. A good tree, good fruit it will beare, The euill yeeldes no fruit as this: Ill fruit on good trees growes no where, By fruit, the tree best knowen is. The ill, men hew, with fire to burne: The good serue for a better turne. Not eu'ry one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, but he that doth Gods will, In heau'n be sure shall saued be. My father gardes all his from ill; The wicked that their good workes tell: Shall misse of heau'n, and go to hell. The house on the rocke or sand, the conclusion of this Sermon. All that I haue declared now, Who so doth heare with good intent: Is like to one that did bestow His money well, that he had spent, To build a house for him and his, Where rayne and wind hurt not ywis. But who so heareth these my words, And doth them not, is like a man, That charges great in deed affoords: To build a house where no man can, Vpon the sandes, where sea and wind, Do spoyle and swallow all they find. When Iesus, thus had finished This Sermon which he there did preach, The people were astonished, To heare what doctrine Christ did teach. He taught as with authoritie, Vnlike the Scribe or Pharisie. Christ after his Sermon descending from the hill and going to Capernaum, healed a leaper by the way. Descending downe then from the hill, A leaper met him by the way: And cryed, master if you will, Both helpe, and heale me here you may. I will, said Christ, be cleane, and gone, See that thou tell it vnto none. Go to the Priest thy selfe to show, That he may iudge if thou be cleane, And offer there that thou doest owe, What Moses did appoint I meane: Giue them their due of all thy wealth, That they may witnesse of thy health. Christ healed the Centurions seruant of the palsie. As Christ came Capernaum to, A Captaine there, a Gentile borne, Who for his seruant was so woe, That he seemed a man forlorne; He sought all meanes his health to haue: Christ with a word his life did saue. The Captaines great humilitie, And faith: Christ Iesus did commend. In Israell then verelie, Like prayse to none he did extend. Of these said Christ shall many come: To heau'n, and haue the childrens roome. Christ cast out a deuill at Capernaum, and diliuered the possessed from that infirmitie. And so vpon the Sabboth day, Into the Synagogue he went: Those workes to do without delay, For which he to the world was sent; The people did vpon him gaze, His doctrine did them so amaze. He taught as with authoritie, Not as the Scribes were wont to do. Or the dissembling Pharisie, To whom Christ oft pronounced woe. But as Gods onely sonne in deed: Sent man to saue, as God decreed. And in the Synagogue there was, A man possessed, euen then: Whoso cure Christ Iesus brought to passe, Yea in the sight of all those men. His doctrine he confirmed still: With wonders, which he wrought at will. Sathan that wicked spirite he, Began within the man to cry; Oh what haue we to do with thee? I know thou art assuredly The holy one of God, his ioy: Art thou come vs for to destroy? Iesus rebuked him, and said, Come out of him and hold thy peace. Sathan of Christ was all affrayd, Yet loath the man for to release. But forced thence, the deuill did fly, Crying; and tare him cruelly, When he came out, the standers by, Were much amazed at the sight: Asking each other busily, How they supposed that this might Be done of him? what thing is this? What thinke you that this doctrine is? The spirites with authoritie, He doth commaund; and they obay. His fame was spread immediatly, Throughout that region eu'ry way. All Galilie did heare his fame: And countreys bord'ring on the same. Christ raised Peters mother in law. Christ from the Synagogue did go, To Symons house as doth appeare: With Andrew, Iames, and Iohn also; His Godhead he declared there. Men tasted still in eu'ry place, In ample measure of his grace. For when to Peters house he came, Peters wife mother sicke there lay: A feauer vexed sore the dame, Which Christ rebuking, went away. By touch of hand Christ helped her, And she to them did minister. Christ cast out deuils, and healed all that came vnto him. When euen came he healed all They brought to him that vexed were; And the possessed there withall, Of deuils, among the people there. That what the Prophets said before, Might be approued euermore. Iesus passed thence to preach to other Cities. So he that night went to take rest, But rose againe by breake of day: For to go thence he thought it best, Into a desert place away. Christ then they sought, and found, kept so As men loath he should from them go. But Christ said vnto them, I must To others preach assuredly The kingdome of God, this my trust I will discharge most faithfully. And so he preaching dayly went Through Galilie, as he was sent. It came to passe as Iesus taught, The people pressed on to heare: Some faithfull, some with faults full fraught, Both good and bad to him drew neare. The word of God Christ did not let, To preach then by Genezaret. And seeing shippes by the lake side, Although the Fishermen were gone To wash their nets then in the tide: Yet Christ went boldly into one. The same was Symons ship in deed, To aske him leaue he had no neede. Yet Christ required him that he, Would thrust a little from the land; That of the preasse he might be free, He left them on the banke to stand: And sitting downe he taught them there, That to his doctrine did giue care. After Christ had preached out of the ship, at the lake of Genezareth, he miraculouslie tooke a great multitude of fishes. When Christ left speaking, then he said To Symon; launch the deepe into: Cast out your nets, be not dismaid, Make heare a draught before ye go. Trauailde we haue maister in deed, All night, and yet we could not speed. Neuerthelesse, at thy commaund, I will let downe the net againe: Oh maister, thou shalt vnderstand, That I let not for any paine. Which done, of fishes they did take So many, that their nets they brake. Then beckned they for helpe vnto Their partners, in the other boate: To come, for they had much adoe, To saue what they as then had got. The ships they filled when they came: They both almost sunke with the same. When Symon saw it, all affraid At Iesus knees downe flat he fell: Go from me Lord, withall he said, I am a sinner, I know well. For he and they astonied were, That draught had put them in such feare. And so was Iames and Iohn also Amazed, wondring all at this: And Iesus said to Symon tho, Thou shalt henceforth catch men iwis. When they the ships had brought to land, They followed Iesus out of hand. Christs answer to a Scribe that would follow him. When Iesus then had finished The myracle yee heard before: Perceiuing that him followed, Then companies still more and more, Christ his disciples did command, To passe the riuer out of hand. Then came a Scribe to him and said, Oh maister, I will follow thee: For aunswer he was not delaid, The Foxes haue their holes ye see: And fowles (said Christ) their nests; but I Haue not a place wherein to lie. Christs aunswer to one of his disciples that would go burie his Father. Then a disciple leaue did pray, He might go first, and in his graue (As custome was) his father lay, Him so to do Christ would not haue; Thine office and thy call see thou, (Not worldly workes) go follow now. The greater worke thou maist not leaue, To take the lesser worke in hand: They that do so themselues deceiue, Thy charge learne thou to vnderstand; And let the dead therefore, said he, Their dead burie, and follow me. Christ as he passed the lake to the Gergesens, stilled with his word a tempest. When Christ aboord the ship was gone, Him his disciples followed: Where suddainly to them anon, A cruell tempest happened. But Iesus then slept very fast, Whom they were forst to wake at last. For as they passed then the lake, Vnto the Gergesens to goe: The winde and weather sore did shake Their ship, and they all full of woe, Calde Christ to helpe, whose word, I say, The wind and weather did obay. Christ passing ouer into the countrey of the Gergesens, met two men there possessed with deuils: which he healed, and gaue the deuils leaue to go into the heard of swine. It is supposed of some, that this heard contained 2000. swine, for they were many. When to the other side they came, There two possessed met them then, Out of the graues: for in the same, Then commonly remain'd those men. Their fiercenesse so did men affray, That no man might go by that way. And yet behold immediatly, Assoone as Iesus Christ they sawe They all began on him to crie; (Sathan of him did stand in awe) Oh Iesus (said they) what haue we, Thou Sonne of God to do with thee? Before the time what art thou come, To torment vs, hither this way? This time supposed is of some, That Satan meant the iudgement day. A heard of Swine fed certainly Farre off from where the men did lie. The deuils beseeching Christ did say, If thou do cast vs out giue leaue, That go into those swine we may. Christ Iesus did their sute receiue: He bid them go, and so they went Into the Swine as they were sent. And the whole heard with violence, Into the sea ranne from the hill: The heardmen also fled from thence, Their losse they tooke it verie ill. They of the swine they had before, Then of their health regarded more. These newes, being brought the cittie to, The cittizens came out apace: They for their swine made much adoe, Because they had no better grace. They crau'd that Christ would leaue with speed Their coasts: which he did then in deed. Sending the man late cur'de away, Which would so faine with him haue gone: But Christ gaue charge without delay, He should go shew what God had done, Among his friends, who with good will, Went backe and did his charge fulfill. Christ returning from the Gergesens to Capernaum, healed one of the Palsey. To his owne cittie thence he came, And lo, they brought him one in bed: The Palsey had made him so lame, That he lay there as one halfe dead. My sonne arise, take vp, said he, Thy bed, thy sinnes forgiuen be. The Scribes thought these blasphemous words, Why thinke ye so (said Christ) againe? You see what mercy God affoords: Doe you at me therefore disdaine? I spake that you may know I may Forgiue his sinnes: rise go thy way. Christ also healed a leaper there. Another leaper then againe, Christ healed of his leprosie: Iesus did no disease disdaine, He helped all indifferently. This leaper fell downe on his face: Calling on Christ for helpe and grace. So Iesus stretching forth his hand, Did touch him: saying, so I will, Be cleane: and straight at his command, The man was healed of his ill. And Christ commaunded him to say Nothing of this: but go his way. Yet go (said he) the priest vnto, And shew thy selfe: for so I will. The lawe this likewise bids thee doe, And it of force thou must fulfill. The priest must iudge (said Christ) of thee: If wholy cleansed that thou be. The more that Christ himselfe kept close, The more hereby encreasd his fame: The bruit by this begun, so rose, That more and more was spred his name; So that the sicke from place to place, Came and receiued of his grace. The calling of Mathew from the receipt of custome. As Iesus forth from thence did passe, Mathew he cald, and went to meate Home straight with him from the same place, With whom some Publicans did eate. The Pharisies found fault with this: Christ told them how they thought amisse. The whole seekes no physick at all, The sicke of the Phisition Haue need: and oft for him do call. So sinners I haue mercy on, For the repentant me doth moue, As doth the righteous, him to loue. Of the time and causes of fasting, Christ answered the Pharisies and Iohns disciples. Then Iohns disciples came, and said, The Pharisies fast oft, and we: But thy disciples vnaffraid, Do eate and drinke abroade with thee. Then Iesus said, the children sure, Mourne not: while that the feast endure. But when the Bridegroome shall be gone, Then they will all fast at that day. No man doth patch a new piece on An old garment, it rents away. The law obserued is by thee: The Gospell makes the other free. New wine will burst the bottels sure If they be old: therefore I say, Sith ceremonies may endure No longer time, but must delay, Let new wine haue new vessels then, And be contented with these men. Christ healed a woman that had bin sick of a bloudie issue twelue yeares, and raised Iayrus daughter from death. As Christ with Iairus thence did go, To raise his daughter lately dead: A woman sick twelue yeares or moe, With touching him, of health was sped. And after that where they did see, The maide from death deliu'red he. Christ gaue sight to the blind. When Iesus did from him depart, Two blind men meeting him did crie, Thou sonne of Dauid ease our smart. Beleeue ye then said Christ, that I Can helpe? yes Lord said they: then he Did touch their eyes, and made them see. Christ casteth out a deuill, and maketh the dumbe man to speake. Againe, they brought a dumbe man there, Possessed with a deu'll: but he Cast out the deu'll, to their great feare: And the dumbe spake, which Christ made free. The people maruaild, yet some said, He had done it by Satans aide. So Iesus went from place to place, Teaching and healing eu'ry one: To all that sought, he did giue grace, He was of great compassion. The labourers are few said he, Yet is the haruest great yee see. At the poole of Bethesda, Christ healed a man that had bene diseased 38. yeares, and being accused defended his fact. After all this, against the feast Of Passeouer, which then was nie, Christ Iesus that tooke little rest, Vnto Ierusalem did hie. That holy Sabaoth of the Lord, The Iewes obseru'd with one accord. Christ at Ierusalem then found A multitude of sicke and lame: About Bethesda lying round, Abiding till the Angell came. When as the Angell stird the poole, The water still made one man whole. Christ by that poole a man did see, That had lyen sicke there very long: Wilt thou be whole oh man, said he? Sir I want helpe among this throng. Rise thou said Christ, thy bed vp take: For perfect whole I do thee make. Christ heal'd him on the Sabboth day; Whereat the Iewes were grieued sore: And sought our Sauiour Christ to slay, Rewarded thus he was therefore. The Iewes accusing Christ, do moue Him iustly them for to reproue. To whom the father witnessed, And Iohn did testifie the same: The Scriptures also verified, As did his works so full of fame, That he the sonne of God should be: The stubburne Iewes him would not see. Christ defended his Disciples accused for plucking eares of corne on the Sabboth. Three feasts the Iewes kept yeare by yeare, And chiefest Sabboth dayes did call: Of the same feasts it doth appeare, The Passeouer was first of all: This they the feast of sweet bread name, On this day they from Egypt came. The next was that whereon God gaue, The law by Moses vnto men: That day in reuerence we haue, The holy Ghost was giuen then: This some the feast of weekes do say, Some Pentecost, some Whitsonday. The feast of Tabernacles last Came of these three in order there: Those feasts were neuer fully past, Till all their dayes accomplisht were. The first and last day of each feast, Were counted chiefe of all the rest. The seu'nth day also through the yeare, Is was and so shall be for aye, With them and Christians eu'ry where, In solemne wise a Sabboth day, Though theirs and ours do disagree; One day with them obserue not we. Christ passed thorough a corne field, Vpon the second Sabboth day, This doth to many matter yeeld, To reason when he went that way. Some say it was in Easter feast, The last and chiefe day of the rest. That day the first, doth answer well, And so the second Sabboth day Men might it call; it did excell, The middle dayes as all men say. And there withall time of the yeare, This reason good makes to appeare. Some thinke it was on Whitsonday, Because this Sabboth second was, As they suppose, and that no way, The first did the same Sabboth passe. These reasons both, may please all such, As selfe-will leades not ouermuch. That day a Sabboth day was sure, When the Disciples plucked corne: Which thing the Iewes could not indure, They did the act most vilely scorne. Not knowing him that went that way, To be Lord of the Sabboth day. The cause they did not waigh withall, That hunger then did cause the same: The Pharisies on Christ did call, And his Disciples fowlie blame. They did prefer tradition, Before their owne saluation. But Christ said vnto them againe, What Dauid did who hath not read? Now his example doth remaine, Though Dauid lye a good while dead. These do as he did them before, When he and his did hunger sore. He had the meate that was forbid: These breake you thinke the Sabboth day: They do as he and his then did, Find fault with him yet no man may. The Priests do in the Temple so The Sabboth breake, yet free they go. One greater then the Temple is, And here he standeth verely: Mercy will I, not sacrifice; Learne what this meaneth faithfully. Then will you not condemne this day, These innocents that hurt no way. The sonne of man is Lord likewise, Yea euen of the Sabboth day: Shall I then these so much despise, Or suffer them for foode decay? Though fault with them you find so soone: The law allowes what they haue done. The day is made all men to serue, And no man made to serue that day: Should not man then his life preserue, Vpon the Sabboth, if he may? The law that bindeth man so fast, To finish I am come at last. Christ healed one in the Synagogue on the Sabboth day, that had a withered hand, and answered his accusers. Now Christ disposed to beat downe, Their grieuous superstition, Went shortly after to their towne, To reason of this question. And to the Synagogue he went, The fittest place for his intent. For there was alwayes most resort, Which was our Sauiours Christs desire: That many men might haue comfort, All his affection was on fire. This his deuise to further then, Fell out a worke among those men. A man there with a withered hand, Was present in that very place: They said giue vs to vnderstand, If law allow men so much grace, As to be cured on this day? Christ to accuse they sought a way. Christ answered to them againe, What man shall haue a sillie sheepe, Fall in a pit, and lye in payne: If it were worst of all he keepe, And will not on the Sabboth day: Haue care to fetch it thence away? How much more may a man be then, Preferd before a sheepe I pray? There is no law forbiddeth men, To do good on a Sabboth day. Stretch forth said Christ, thy withered hand: This heard they all that there did stand. It was restored to him so, And all the people saw the same: It fild the Pharisies with woe, Which sought for to eclipse his fame. And they went out with litle ioy, Deuising Christ for to destroy. For they had missed their intent, Which made them rage so much the more: To trappe him in his words they meant, Yet fayl'd as they had done before. His worthy works they did despise: And went his death for to deuise. But he that knew their meaning well, Departed thence, and went away: He needed not that man should tell, That they sought how they might him slay. His fathers will he did respect: And he his works did well effect. Great multitudes him followed thence, And he likewise them healed all: Each one that came in his presence, And vnto him for helpe did call. Yet charged them they should not tell, Or make him knowne, if they did well. Esayas Prophecie tooke place; My seruant whom I chose ywis, And my beloued full of grace, In whom my soule delights, is this. My spirite put on him I will: And he shall iudge the Gentiles still. He shall not striue in word or deed, None in the street shall heare his voyce: He shall not breake a bruised reed, The Gentiles shall in him reioyce. Yea smoaking flaxe quench shall not he: Till he both iudge and victor be. Christ then had twise refelled such Opinions fond, as they did hold: At first they had presumed much, And then againe did seeme as bold. The Sabboth lets no man at need, His wants supply, or do good deed. Iesus seeing the multitude dispersed as sheepe hauing no shepheard, tooke compassion on them. And Iesus Christ did not ceasse then, But went about to eu'ry place, In townes and Cities among men, To preach, and he was full of grace. He healed each disease they had: All men of him were very glad. But when he saw the multitude, He tooke on them compassion: The people seemed very rude, And wanting consolation. For all abroad they scattered were, As sheepe that had no shepheard there. The haruest great and the labourers few. The haruest is surely said he, Now very great, yet few I say, Do labour in the same: pray ye The Lord thereof to send away Some labourers for to take paine, That by his haruest he may gaine. Christ called his xij. Apostles, and sent them forth to preach, giuing them power to worke miracles and heale diseases. Then his Disciples Christ did call, Power to them he gaue and grace, That vncleane spirites they should all, Cast out of men, in eu'ry place. As free you haue, so likewise deale: All sicke-men freely see you heale. Twelue, Iesus did send forth to preach, And did command them saying so: Among the Gentiles them to teach, Or to Samaria do not go. To the lost sheepe of Israell Go first of all these newes to tell. Say ye, and teach that now at hand The kingdome of our God doth come, Saluation throughout the land, Is surely sent to all and some. To all that will beleeue, say ye, That they the same shall shortly see. Heale ye the sicke, the leapers clense, Raise vp the dead, the deuils out cast, And see when ye depart from hence, Ye freely giue from first to last. And in your iourney take no care: What weeds ye weare, or how ye fare. What house or Citie ye come to, Among the worthy there remaine, Till you from thence haue cause to go, Let them with you in peace retaine. Such as do not deserue this grace, Shake of their dust in the same place. That dust shall witnesse against those, That you desired not their wealth: And earthly treasure, that they chose Before this proffred sauing health. They in the iudgement sure shall gaine, Of Sodome and Gomorh the paine. As sheepe, I send you simple men, In midst of worldly wolues to go: Be ye as wise as Serpents then, And innocent as doues also. To kings and counsels for my sake, When you are brought, no thought then take. For what ye speake, it is not ye: When torments for you do remaine, The holy Ghost in you shall be, To guide your speach, and ease your paine. The father shall the sonne said he, And friend his friend betray for me. Ye shall be hated for my name, But he that dureth to the end, Shall saued be, and voyde of blame. From persecution you defend, From Citie to another go: If you haue need for to do so. For the Disciple is not sure, Nor the seruant his Lord aboue: Like death if you as I endure, A signe it is of perfect loue. If Beelzebub they do call me: Is it strange then you so should be? Nothing is hid, but that shall I Make manifest, and what ye heare In secret, preach it openly. Of men ye need not stand in feare; Feare him that soule and body may Destroy in hell, feare him I say. If that a sparow shall not fall, Nor any haire of yours decay, But that your father cares for all, And ouer all doth beare a sway: Why should you care or be afrayd? You shall be sure to haue his ayde. Who so shall me on earth confesse, Or me deny before men here, Shall haue the like and nothing lesse, In heau'n, before my father there. For my cause peace must needs decay, And dearest friends their friends shall slay. Who father, friend, his sonne or wife, Doth loue more then he loueth me: Who so my Crosse (to saue his life) Doth not take vp, but seeks to flye. The one vnworthy of me is: The other shall not scape ywis. He that receiueth you, or me, Receiueth him that vs hath sent: A Prophet who receiueth, he Reward shall haue to his content. These litle ones who doth relieue: God sure to him reward will giue. Christes Sermon at the sending forth of his Apostles to preach. When Iesus had then made an end, Of giuing these commandements To his, whom he then forth did send, To teach the Iewes good documents: The place he stood in was a plaine, And with him many did remaine. Yea multitudes of people were, Out of all Iurie standing by: From Tyre and Sydon they were there, To heare his doctrine verely, And at his hands to haue reliefe, Each one as he was painde with griefe. And they that with fowle spirits sore Tormented were, Christ heal'd them all: And still they sought him more and more, (Which boldly durst not on him call) To touch his vesture as he went: For health thereby to them was sent. Then Iesus lifted vp his eyes, On his Disciples, saying this: Ye poore are blessed euen thrise, For yours Gods kingdome surely is. Ye that now hunger blessed are, You shall be sure of better fare. And ye that weepe, yet blessed are, For ye shall likewise laugh againe: When men hate you, take ye no care, And when they do procure your paine. Nor yet when they you separate, Reuiling at your base estate. If for the sonne of mans sake, they Your names put out as euill men, Reioyce ye greatly, God obay, And be in heart glad of it then. Behold in heau'n reward haue ye: The Prophets were, as now ye be. But woe to them that rich are here, And do repose thereon their trust: The day will come it shall appeare, They dearly bought vile earth and dust. In heau'n true treasure may be found: Each thing corrupts that growes in ground. Woe be to you that now are full, For yee shall hunger after this: If you were not exceeding dull, For meate, ye would not morgage blisse, Woe be to you that now laugh so, For you shall waile and weepe for wo. Woe be to you whom men do praise, And speake well of, deseruing ill: When yee haue spent out all your dayes, You shall be wray what was your will. False Prophets were by like deuise, Among your elders had in price. But vnto you which heare, I say, Your enemies see that yee loue: To them that hate you, if ye may, Shew how my doctrine doth you moue To do them good, and blesse withall, And pray for them, that wish your fall. To him that smiteth thee also, Vpon one cheeke, the other giue: Who so thy cloake would take thee fro, Giue him thy coate, and do not grieue To purchase so a quiet life, And stirre thou no debate or strife. Giue eu'ry man that asketh thee: And he that takes thy goods away By force or fraude how so it be: Aske thou them not againe I say. But vnto other men so do, As thou wouldst be of them done to. If that ye loue, do good, or lend, To them that do requite the same, Each sinner so doth for his friend; You should do more then such for shame. Be mercifull to such as need: For so your father is indeed. Christ healed the Centurions seruant being absent: the Centurions faith. After that Christ had finished His Sermon, as you heard before: From thence he likewise hastened; For he desired more and more, The worke he had in hand to end: Which for our good did wholly tend. As Capernaum he came to, A Captaine there a Gentile borne, Made for his seruant much adoe, That seemed then a man forlorne. He su'd by meanes his health to haue: Christ with a word his life did saue. The Captaines great humility, And faith, our Sauiour did commend: In Israëll then certainly, Like praise to none he did extend. Of these said Christ shall many come To heau'n: and haue the childrens roome. Christ raised from death the widowes sonne at Naijm. The next day after, Christ did raise The widows sonne to life againe: And all the people gaue God praise, That present then did there remaine. All they did spread abroad his fame, That either saw or heard the same. Iohn Baptists message to Christ by two of his disciples. Iohn Baptist was in prison cast, Herodias had obtaind the same: And his disciples came in hast, And told him there of Iesus fame. Yet he in prison as before, Would winne to Christ disciples more. For when his workes to him were told, That his disciples might beleeue In Iesus Christ: Iohn said; behold, A message vnto you I giue, (Iohn knew him well assuredly: As he oft times did testifie. But that his might also perceiue, That Christ the true Messiah was: Of whom they should all grace receiue, In whom they might all truth embrace.) Go ye, and say, Iohn sent to thee, To aske if thou be euen he? They went, and both to Iesus came, And said to him, our maister sent: To know if thou be sure the same, Or else another that is meant? Men knew as then that Christ should come: How, when, or where, that knew but some. Christs answer sent backe to Iohn by his disciples. Go back said Christ, to Iohn againe, Shew him what yee do heare and see: The blinde and halt are rid of paine, The leapers and the deafe go free: The dead are raised vp, this day The poore, the gospell beare away. And therewithall to them he gaue, A gentle admonition, His humblenesse that they might haue In reu'rent estimation. Blessed said Christ, shall that man be, That taketh no offence by me. Christs testimonie of Iohn Baptist. When they were gone, then Christ began To speake vnto the company: What went yee out to see? a man Infected with inconstancie? Iohn you in wildernesse did finde: Not as a reede, shakt with the winde. What went ye then out for to see? A man cloathed in soft raiment? Such men in kings courts vse to be: Iohn is with meaner weed content. Iohns raiment showes him to be plaine: He flattred not, he could not faine. But what went yee out then to see? A prophet? I say to you more. Of whom is written, (this is he) My messenger shall go before. This is Elias, whom they say, Should come for to prepare the way. No greater among men did rise Then Iohn the Baptist, verely, Not any that you can deuice. Yet this I say, assuredly The least in heau'n goes him before: And doth enioy Gods graces more. Gods kingdome suffreth violence, Since Iohns time to this very day: The Gentiles with all diligence Without the law, new cald, obay. The lawe and Prophets haue their end: For he is come whom yee attend. He that hath eares to heare, may heare. Marke what I say therefore, amend, Sith that Elyas did appeare, The law and Prophets made an end. Yet you remaine both deafe and blind, That may your true Messiah find. Christ reprooueth his auditorie. This generation it is, Like children that their fellowes call: And say we piped haue iwis, And yet yee daunced not at all. So you deferre from day to day, For to repent for all we say. Hard was the life that Iohn did lead, For meate and drinke he tooke no care: He had a deuill, men supposed. The sonne of man they do compare, With gluttons, and with drunkards, when He eateth meat as other men. Christ vpbraideth the vnthankefull citties, wherein he had taught and done so many miracles, and yet they repented not. Then Christ began for to vpbraid, The citties that so oft had seene His workes: and yet for all delaid For to repent, as they had beene Cleane void of sinne, or had no will, To learne the good, and leaue the ill. Chorazin wo be vnto thee, And to Bethsayda woe likewise: The great works that were done by me In you, yee greatly did despise. If they in Tyrus had bene done, It had repented long agone. If Tyre and Sidon had, I say, Both seene, and heard what ye did heare: Saceloth and ashes eu'ry day Had beene their weed; ye buy it deare, For at the iudgement then to thee, To them more easie shall it be. Thou Capernaum lift so hie, Yea raised vp to heau'n aboue, To hell thou shalt be brought to lye, Because my works thee neuer moue. If they in Sodome had bene wrought, It had not yet bene brought to nought. For Sodome it shall easier be, Oh Capernaum be thou sure, At the last iudgement, then for thee, Thy punishment for to endure. Tyre, Sydon, and Sodom shall haue More ease then these, though then they craue. Christ his gratulation for the successe of the Gospell by his Apostles. Then Iesus said, I giue to thee (Oh mightie Lord and Father deare) Most hartie thanks, thou hearest me, And to my call thou giuest eare. These things thou hidest from the wise, Their worldly wit thou doest despise. Thy secrets vnto babes withall, And humble men, thou doest declare: These do on thee for mercy call, These, these, oh God thy chosen are. This thy good pleasure was, and is: Oh Father none can alter this. All things to me now giuen are Of my father, the sonne and he, No mortall man can well declare One of them both, except he be Taught by the sonne, and so he may Learne both to know, this onely way. Christs exhortation to beare the Crosse. Ye that are laden, come to me, Come all that wearie are likewise: And you shall all refreshed be, They shall haue wo, that me despise. I am the life, the light, the way: They that seeke me shall not decay. Take vp my yoke, and learne of me, For meeke and lowly sure I am: Rest to his soule so find shall he, Whose necke, my yoke, doth onely tame. My yoke is easie day and night, And so my burthen verie light. Christ dined in the house of Symon the Pharisie, was annointed of a sinfull woman, and being accused, defended himself, and her fact. Then of the Pharisies came one, Which bid Christ to his house to meate: And Iesus went with him anone, And at the table sate to eate. While he was there, came by and by, A sinfull woman verely; And when she knew he was set downe, At table with the companie: (Because she dwelled in that towne, No man mislikt her modestie:) With boxe in hand of ointment sweet, She came and fell at Iesus feete. To shew withall her miserie, She stood Christ Iesus backe behind: And there shed teares abundantly, The tokens of a wofull mind. With teares his feete she washed faire, And then did wipe them with her haire. And oftentimes she kist his feete, That so she washed with such care: Her boxe of ointment very sweet, To spend on them she did not spare. Her sinnes so great, she did beleeue, That Christ would them to her forgiue. And Symon seeing what was donne, By her since she his house came to: This to conceiue, he then begonne, If this man were a Prophet lo, He would know that this woman is A sinner, that his feete doth kisse. Then Iesus vnto Symon sayd, Somwhat I haue to say to thee. No longer let it be delayd, Oh master, this againe said he. Though Christ perceiued Symon well, Yet knew not he what Christ would tell. There was a certaine lender had, Two debters, and their state was such, That neither of them could be glad, Their debt to either was so much. The one fiue hundred pence, I know, The other fiftie pence did owe. When neither knew what shift to make, For they had not wherewith to pay, The lender did then pitie take, Forgaue them, and sent both away. Oh Symon shew me if thou can, Which of them will loue most this man? He answered, and said againe, He vnto whom he most forgaue: For he was rid of greatest paine, And had most need of both to craue. Then Iesus said, thou iudgest right: Behold this woman in thy sight. Into thy house when first I came, Thou gau'st my feete no water tho: Yet she with teares hath washt the same, And wipt them with her haire also. No kisse of thee I had, I say, She kissed hath my feete this day. Thou diddest not mine head annoint, But she annointed hath my feete: (Christ reasoned from point to point, Of her and of her odours sweet:) Wherefore her sinnes, I say to thee, (Though many) all forgiuen be. Whom much or litle men forgiue, Like measure they do yeeld of loue: It will no good man therefore grieue, That men his mercy so should moue. And to the woman, then sayd he, Thy sinnes they are forgiuen thee. But they that sate with him at meate, Began within themselues to say, How can this man that here doth eate, Forgiue sinnes? this God onely may, Christ said to her, from labour cease: Thy faith hath sau'd thee, go in peace. The women that Christ had deliuered from euill spirites and healed of sundry infirmities, followed him as he went from place to place to preach the Gospell, and ministred vnto him of their substance. And afterward, it came to passe, That Christ from towne to towne would go, Preaching, and publishing apace, The kingdome then of God also. The twelue Apostles with him were, And certaine women eu'ry where. Some of them Christ had helpt before, And rid of their infirmities: He cured with his word their sore, And healed all their maladies. Yea deu'ls he out of many sent: Seuen out of Magdalen there went. Ioanna, also Chuzas wife, King Herods steward then was there, A woman of a godly life, And one that stood of God in feare. Susanna, and a number mo, From place to place with Christ did go. They for their health receiu'd, restore To Christ all kind of thankfulnesse: To him and his they of their store Did minister with ioyfulnesse. Those women all with full intent, To heare and learne Gods word were bent. And when into a house they came, The multitude met so againe: (So farre abroad was spread his fame,) He could no space alone remaine. Both he and his, though they had meate, Had then no time the same to eate. Then they brought vnto Iesus one Possessed with a deuill, I find, And him for helpe they call vpon, The man withall was dumbe and blind. These three impediments had he: Yet with his word Christ made him free. The multitude amazed were, And praysed God with hart and voyce: The sonne (said they) of Dauid here, Doth geue vs cause for to reioyce: And now we all assured be, This Christ the Lord is euen he. But the hard hearted Pharisies, When they heard this, began to say: He fils you full of phantasies, For Beelzebub this part doth play; Without his helpe he neuer can Cast out the deu'll out of a man. A kingdome or a Citie deuided within it selfe cannot endure. But Iesus knew their thoughts before, And therefore vnto them did say: What kingdome warreth very sore Within it selfe, without decay? What Citie or what house may stand, Deuided so, in any land? If Sathan cast out Sathan sure, Or I by Beelzebub do so, His kingdome cannot long endure: One thing I aske you and no mo; By whom do your sonnes cast them out? They shall you iudge in this no doubt. If I through God cast out the same, Then is his kingdome come this day: If one man to a strong man came, To spoile his house, and runne away, Can he his purpose bring to passe, Ere he be bound that owner was? But I by force gaue him the foyle, Whose helpe you say, I daily vse: The more for you that I do toyle, The more you still do me abuse. He that on my side is not, he Against me fully sure must be. Blasphemie. Each sinne, and so each blasphemy, Shall be forgiuen men, I say, If they repent it hartely, And for remission do pray; Except against the holy Ghost, Of all, this sinne offendeth most. The sinne against the sonne of man, Which oftentimes doth hap and chance: Both francke and free remit I can, For it may come of ignorance. The works Gods spirit works are such, That they cannot be hidden much. Take heed ye do not then offend, Or sinne against the holy Ghost: God will not sure world without end, Forgiue that sinne, he hates it most. The tree and fruit make good I say, Or make both fit to cast away. As by the fruit we know the tree, So by your wordes, ye knowen are: Oh vipers, you that euill be, Your speaches do your workes declare. The hart it storeth good or ill, Whereof the mouth doth sauour still. Both good men and the euill show, What treasure they haue hid in hart: At the last iudgement you shall know, How well or ill you plaide your part. Vaine talke who so doth here affoord, Shall answer for each idle word. Christ denied the Iewes any signe, sauing onely the signe of Ionas. The Scribes and Pharisies withall, Came tempting Christ, and sought a signe, As if on sight thereof they all, From former faults would then decline. But Christ that knew the inward mind, With words they could not so make blind. Christ answered, and said againe, Thou wicked generation, Adulterous, and very vaine, Though signes thou doest depend vpon, No signe shall geuen be to thee, But that of Ionas thou shalt see. As three dayes and three nights he was, Within the whale all couered: So shortly it will come to passe, I shall in earth be buried. Three dayes and three nights verely, In graue the sonne of man shall lye. Christ argued the Iewes of impenitencie. The men of Niniuie shall rise With these, and shall condemne them to: They Ionas words did not despise, But did repent, as you should do. One greater then Ionas is here, Yet small repentance doth appeare. The Queene of Saba she shall rise, In Iudgement, with these men also: And them she shall condemne likewise, That so farre from her home would go To heare king Salomon; I say, His greater yet you heare this day. Christ prnounced an heauie sentence against such as reuolt from the truth receiued. They which are once deliuered From vncleane spirits, free and well: Are after iustly punished, If in them they againe do dwell. Their last end sure farre worse shalbe, Then was the first, take this of me. The vncleane spirit places dry, Doth walke throughout seeking a rest: Where faith, where hope, where charitie, Is setled sure within mans brest, It is so dried with Gods grace, That deuils haue there no resting place. Then he returneth home againe, Into the house from whence he went: (For all this while he walkt in vaine, And missed still of his intent) This house he findeth swept within, Cleane voide of vertue, deckt with sinne. Then taketh he seauen spirits more, As ill as he in euery thing: And dwels where he did dwell before, His end is worse then beginning. So shall it with this people be, They mend not for all that they see. This spirit is the deuill indeed, His house is man where he doth dwell, The drie place where he cannot speed, Mans heart it is, heat by God well With godly zeale, and hate of sinne; He rests not there though he come in. Christ shewed who his mother, sisters, and brethren are. While Christ spake to the company, His mother and his brethren were Without: desiring earnestly, To talke with him as may appeare. Then one of them that was there, came And told our sauiour of the same. But he preferring farre before, The worke that he then had in hand, Encreasing daily more and more; He said, to such as there did stand, My mother and brethren be they, That do my doctrine still obey. My mother, whom I loue so well, My brethren, whom I like also, Are these: and they (marke what I tell) For brother and sister shall go. My friends they are who so do still, Performe and keepe my fathers will. The state of the kingdome of God, set forth by seauen parables, and first of the seed. By parables Christ taught men plaine, The state, nature, and worthinesse Of Gods word: he did not disdaine, To shew alwaies his readinesse, His chosen in all things he may To helpe; and winne them eu'ry way. Christ though of late he had bene let, And interrupted by his friends, His office he did not forget, For their great fault he made amends. To the sea side from thence he went, To preach againe with like intent. And the same place, was the sea side That by Genezaret doth lie, Where he sat downe for to abide; But preased on with company, He tooke a ship wherein he sate, And taught them as he had done late. The people standing on the shore, With diligence did giue him eare: The multitude encreasing more, The more of him did stand in feare. Whose words and workes they all did see, In eu'ry thing so well agree. Behold, said Christ, a sower went To sowe his seed; but some seed fell Farre otherwise then he had meant By the way side, which could not well Yeeld fruite: the fowle without delay Deuour'd them all so cleane away. Some fell on stonie ground also, Where they of earth had little store: They sprung the rather there, but lo The sunne rose vp and parcht them sore: And so for lack of roote, I say, Anon they witherd all away. Among the thornes some other fell, Which springing vp were choakt withall: Some fell in good ground and did well. The same brought fruite where they did fall, One corne an hundreth fold or moe, Some sixtie, some thirty also. He that hath eares to heare, may heare, For herein the condition Of Gods word may to thee appeare, The rule of thy saluation. Three sorts decayed all, you see, The fourth yeelds onely fruite to me. Then his disciples askt him, why By parables he taught them then? To you said Christ this verely Giu'n is to know, not to those men. The secrets of Gods kingdome ye, Shall learne, and know alwaies of me. To you that haue, more will I giue, That you may haue abundance still: He that hath not, although he greeue, Shall loose all that, against his will. For seeing, they shall neither see, Nor hearing heare, as you heare me. This Prophesie Esayas spake, Which now in them fulfilled is: I will this people surely make, By hearing so to heare iwis, That they shall not yet vnderstand, Nor thinke on that which is at hand. This peoples heart is waxen fat, Their eares of hearing deaffe and dull, They with their eyes haue winked at The truth, least they should see it full, Heare, and perceiue it, as yee doe, And turne, that I might heale them to. But blessed are your eyes, they see, Your eares also do heare the same: All you thereto appointed be, For you and such I surely came. The rest of sinne are very full, And shall remaine both blind and dull. Christ interpreted to his disciples the parable of the seed. This Parable heare yee therefore, When that a man Gods word doth heare, And vnderstands thereof no more Then ere he heard, it may appeare The deuill did catch the word away, That seed by the way side it lay. He that had seed in stonie ground, Did heare the word, and that with ioy, Yet had no roote, he was not sound, He dured not, for eu'ry coy When trouble for the word shall be, Offended very soone is he. He that receiueth seed also, Among the thornes, are they that heare The word of God; yet go it fro, For wordly cares in them appeare. Deceitfulnesse of riches make Gods word in them no place can rake. But he that doth receiue the seed, In the good ground; is euen he That heares the word, and doth indeed Gods word perceiue it for to be. This beareth fruite an hundreth fold, Some sixtie, some thirtie, be bold. The second parable of the good seed, and of the tares declaring likewise the state and condition of Gods word. Another parable Christ spake, The kingdom of heau'n is, I say, Much like one that good seed did take, And sowed it, and went away: But while men slept, the enemy, Did sowe tares there immediatly. And when the blade sprung vp in sight, And brought forth fruite, then did appeare The tares that he had fowne by night: The seruants seeing, said with feare, Didst not thou (Maister) sowe good seed? Whence commeth then this filthie weede? He said, tho enuious man it is That hath done this: the seruants say, Wilt thou that we go gather this; And plucke it vp to cast away? Nay, while about the tares ye go, Left ye plucke vp the wheate also. Let both grow till the haruest come, Then will I to the reapers say, The tares now gather to one roome, And binde them in the fire to lay. My wheate see yee that reapers are, It be brought to my barne with care. This parable declareth well, The state and the condition Of Gods word writ in the Gospell, The doctrine of saluation. The housholder soweth the seeed: The deu'll sowes tares and other weed. The 3. parable of the mustard seed, wherein is set foorth the nature of Gods word. Another parable againe, Christ put forth to them, saying this, Gods kingdome like vnto a graine Of mustard seed assured is: Which man doth sow within his field, That it some fruit to him may yeeld. This seed, of seedes is least of all, Of hearbes it growes the greatest one And is a tree (though not so tall) Yet birds may breed his branch vpon. The nature of Gods word iwis, Is very well comparde to this. For though this seed is very small, And subiect to contempt therefore, Yet it of hearbes growes great'st of all, And birds therein do breed some store. Gods word at first seemes so, I say, Yet groweth great each day by day. And sharpe in tast is mustard seed, Yet heateth man, though bitingly: So is Gods word in very deed Sharpe to the minde, yet soule healthy. Of him that takes of this a graine, It sharply heateth eu'ry vaine. The fourth parable of the leauen, declaring also thereby the nature of Gods word. A parable then like the last, Iesus put forth to them againe, To proue the nature, force, and tast, That in Gods word doth sure remaine. It is like leauen laide in meale, That leaueneth it eu'ry deale. As little leauen leaueth not, Till it haue leauened the meale: So Gods word searcheth eu'ry knot Or vaine in man, his sores to heale. The one makes bread tast well in deed, The other man which most hath need. In parables spake Iesus then, Vnto the people that were there: He would not speake vnto those men, This otherwise: as may appeare, That it might be fulfilled so, Which Dauid spake so long ago. My mouth I will open, saith he, In parables; and shew to man, The things that now so hidden be, And haue bene since the world began. Then Iesus sent the men away, For there he made no longer stay. Christ went into the house, where he declared to his Disciples, desiring it, the meaning of the two parables of the tares. When Christ into the house was come, Then his Disciples to him say; Declare to vs the very summe, And certaine meaning we thee pray, Of the same tares so in the field, We can no reason of them yeeld. Then Christ did answer them againe, He that there sowed the good seed, It was the sonne of man certaine, The field, it is the world in deed, The good seed, are Gods children sure, The tares, the wicked and vnpure. The enemie, the deuill it is, The haruest of the world is end: The Angels are reapers iwis, Which to his haruest God will send: And as the tares are burnt in deed, The wicked so in hell shall speed. The sonne of man then forth shall send His Angels, for to gather all That in his kingdome do offend, And still from sinne to sinne do fall. These to hell fire shall be cast tho, Where they shall gnash their teeth for wo. Then shall the iust men shining be, As is the Sunne in greatest light, In the kingdome of heau'n, said he, Abiding in their fathers sight. See ye these words receiue in feare, With humble heart, and open eare. The fift parable of the treasure hid in the field, declareth the worthinesse of Gods word. While Christ did in the house remaine, (As he had done by the sea side) He spake in parables againe, To such as did with him abide. The worthinesse declared he, And of what price Gods word should be. Like treasure hid within a field Gods kingdome is, which when one found, In hope it would much profit yeeld, He hid the same within the ground; For ioy and hope such wealth to wield, That man sold all to buy that field. The sixt parable of the pearles, declaring as before the worthinesse of Gods word. Againe he said, Gods kingdome is Like to a warie marchant man, That sought pearles, and found one of price, To buy the which this marchant can Find in his heart to sell away All that he hath without delay. Old Abraham was such a one, He left his countrey, friends and all: His wealth he neuer thought vpon, But did obey when God did call. And Dauid that Gods word dist tast, As sweet as hony to his last. And the Apostles they were such, And so the godly Martyrs all: These did esteeme nothing so much, As to obey, when God did call: These marchants, all they had they sold, To buy this pearle, surpassing gold. The seuenth parable of the draw-net, declaring the state and condition of Gods word. Gods kingdome is like a draw net, Which one into the sea doth cast: Things of all sorts when it doth get, He drawes it full from thence at last. The good he doth in vessels lay, But casteth all the bad away. So shall it be at the worlds end, The Angels shall seuer the bad, And such as by no meanes amend, From iust men, which shall then be glad: Though wicked men in fire then do Both waile and gnash their teeth for wo. Then Iesus asking them could say, All these things vnderstand ye yet? Yea Lord, for so say they we may, Thy words we neuer shall forget. By this Christ did teach them againe, The state of Gods word verie plaine. The godly may not seuer now, Themselues away from wicked men, But as the tares in wheate must grow Till haruest time; the reapers then Shall saue the wheate, and for their hire, Shall burne the tares in flaming fire. And eu'ry Scribe said Christ, that is Taught to Gods kingdome, I compare Vnto a housholder iwis, Whose treasure houses stored are: And doth (to whom himselfe so wold) Bring forth (to giue) both new and old. As these, so more of Christ were donne, Then we in writing left vs haue, Approuing him to be Gods sonne, Come to the world mans soule to saue. Yet here the meeke and godly mind, Of heau'nly foode his fill shall find. All glorie be to thee on hye, Oh Father, Sonne and holy Ghost: One mightie God in Trinitie, Which saued vs, that else were lost. To thee be laud oh God therefore, And prayse, and honour, euermore. Amen. THE FOVRTH PART OF THE HISTORIE OF OVR LORD AND SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST, contayning those things which he did the third yeare after his Baptisme, which was the two and thirtieth yeare of his age, according to the foure Euangelistes: the yeare after the creation of the world 4173. beginning at the death of Iohn Baptist. To the tune of the Lords Prayer. Iohn Baptist was beheaded, his head giuen to Herodias daughter, and his body buried by his Disciples the 13. of Aprill. Anno. Domini. 32. The yeare of Christs Natiuitie, The thirtie two, as then it was, And thirteenth day assuredlie Of Aprill, thus it came to passe, That Iohn the Baptist lost his life, To please Herodias, Philips wife. For Iohn had said to Herods face, Herodias may not be thy wife: Which wrought in her that wanted grace, Such feruent hate, she sought his life. She neuer rested night nor day, Till she had got his head away. His doctrine she misliked so, Because he said; she could not be King Herods wife and Phillips to, Two brethren may not mary thee. And though she did him much despise, Yet could not she his death deuise. For Herod heard Iohn willingly, And feared much him to offend: For he confessed Iohn to be Both iust and holy to his end. This was a let, to worke her will, Her malice she could not fulfill. Till it befell when Herod had Enclosed Iohn in prison fast, And on his byrth day to be glad, As he had vsed in times past, A Royall feast he causd to be Made for the states of Galilie. Whereat what hap'ned you shall heare, Though Herod knew it in his hart, That Iohn was iust, and stood in feare, To play with him that bloudie part: For oft he heard him ioyfully, And did obay him willingly. Yet at that feast a daintie Dame, Herodias daughter daunc'd so well, That all that to the banquet came, Commended her, and then befell The thing that was desired so, By the maydes mother long ago. For Herod so was pleasd withall, That straight he gaue without aduise, (Hap what might happen to befall, He did not recken of the price) What gift soeuer she would craue, The same he promisd she should haue. She quickly went and Counsell had, Or else was taught to aske before: This made her mother verie glad, For this she thirsted had so sore. Aske thou Iohn Baptists head she said: Which done, was graunted to the mayd. Though Herod grieued at the same, Yet would not he the gift deny: For feare of foolish worldly shame, And for their sakes that then stood by. Therefore he to the hang-man said, Go fetch his head, giue it the mayd. The minion with Iohn Baptists head, Vnto her mother straightway went: When his Disciples law him dead, His death they greatly did lament; And they his body buried, And thereof Iesus certified. Then Iesus fame so farre was spread, That many wondred at his name: King Herod knew that Iohn was dead, Yet scarsly could beleeue the same. Iohn risen is againe said he, By whom are wrought the works you see. Some other said Elyas was, Or else some Prophet come againe: By whom such workes were brought to passe, To name him Christ they thought it vaine. Yet Herod him desir'd to see, That he might learne what he should be. Christ preaching in his owne countrey, was despised of his countreymen. When as Christ Iesus for to preach, To Nazareth his countrey came, Esayas booke they did him reach, That he might reade vpon the same: Whereout, he taught them what he was, What he should teach, and bring to passe. His doctrine so astonied some, That they did wonder at his words: Whence doth (say they) this wisedome come? Or who to him these works affoords? Is not that Iosephs sonne I pray, The Carpenter, we heard this day? His mother Marie we do call, His brethren be they not with vs? As men amazed they were all, To heare him so that text discusse. Saue in his countrey then, said he, A Prophet shall sure honor'd be. Wherefore he said to them againe, When famine plagued Israell, And they for three yeares wanted raine, And moneths sixe as stories tell, The Prophet then was sent to none, Saue in Sarepta vnto one. Oh Israell, thy leprosie, So great in Elyseus time, Though few could finde a remedie, Naaman yet was cured by him. When they hard this, it grieu'd them sore, And they deuis'd his death therefore. No greater workes there then did he, Then on few sicke his hands to lay: When he their vnbeliefe did see, He maruaild much, and went away, Teaching in eu'ry towne and place, Where he came, and had gotten space. Christ sent forth his Apostles by two and two to preach. And he the twelue did call againe, And sent them forth by two and two: Power of him they did obtaine, And charge withall what they should do; For clothing, or how they should fare, He willed them to take no care. What house ye enter to, said he, There tarrie till ye thence depart: If that you there despised be, They worke themselues the greater smart. Shake from your feet the dust away, As witnesse against such I say. That cittie, house, or man be sure, That will not you receiue or heare, A harder iudgement shall endure, (When all in one place shall appeare) Then Sodome and Gomorhe shall haue, Where worldly wealth can no man saue. So they went forth, and preaching told, That all men should their liues amend. They cast out deuils with courage bold, And as their maister did them send, Of griefes each grieued did relieue, And to the sick they health did giue. The Apostles returning, shewed Christ what great things they had done. When the Apostles came againe, They told to Christ all they had done, Aswell where most they did remaine, As how to preach they had begonne, Relieuing all mens miseries, And helping their infirmities. Christ went aside into the wildernesse with his disciples, where he fed 5000. men with fiue loaues and two fishes. And Iesus said, come hence, depart By ship into another place: He thought he might in the desart Haue had some ease a little space: For he and his Apostles were Much cloide with prease then eu'ry where. This was not done so secretly, The people soone espide the same: In multitudes they after hie, So great was growne Christ Iesus fame, That from the citties all about They follow'd, till they found him out. Bethsayda was neare to the place, Where Christ did meane to take some ease: The people thither ran apace, Each to be cur'd of his disease. Like scattred sheepe the people were, All ready for the Wolfe to reare. To pittie them it did him moue, And that he might expresse the same, And giue them tokens of his loue, He heald their blind, their sick, and lame; And of his kingdome verely, He taught to them the certainty. And now because the time was spent, And that they had farre way to go, Christ thought it was expedient, With meate to feed those men also, Least that they going by the way, Should faint, and of his helpe dismay. When his disciples came him to, Willing the people might be gone: For else said they, how shall they do, The night apace now draweth on. And this is desert where we are: For vittailes therefore let them care. They haue no need to go away, Said Iesus, vnto them againe: See therefore that yee do them stay, Let them a while with vs remaine: And giue you them now of your meate, For I would haue them heare to eate. Then the disciples said, we haue Fiue loaues, two fishes, and no more. Giue thanks to God that the same gaue, He daily will encrease your store: Bring the same hither vnto me, That your prouision I may see. Then Christ commanded on the grasse, The multitude to sit downe round, Where he brought that thing then to passe, Which did their reasons all confound. When he had prai'd and blest the bred, Fiue thousand men therewith he fed. And of that broken meate had they, Twelue baskets full among them all: This was to warne men to obey, And to depend on him withall. They that his kingdome seeke to haue, Shall want nothing that they do craue. For Christs demaund to Phylip was, Where bread for all them might be bought. He knew not what would come to passe, And therefore spake as then he thought; Two hundreth peniworth will not be, To each of them a bit; said he. And Andrew said, here is a boy That hath fiue loaues, and fishes two, And thought it but a very toye, To offer that, all those vnto: Yet with the same, Christ fed as then, As I haue said, fiue thousand men. The multitude when they did see, The miracle that Christ had done: Did straight confesse him then to be, (Assure he was) Gods onely sonne. This Prophet (say they) certainly, We looked for so earnestly. When Iesus therefore did perceiue, That they would seeke to make him king, Worldly conceits could not deceiue, (Or worke in him so base a thing.) Therefore he did himselfe conuay Into a mount out of the way. Christ stilled the raging of the sea, walked on the sea, and saued Peter, when through infidelitie he was ready to sincke. Then Iesus sent by ship before, All his disciples thence away, And eke the people from the shore, And went alone aside to pray. But they were tossed too and fro, The winde and waues then raged so. All this he saw, that seeth all, And therefore went to ease their paine: Who so doth come when he doth call, Or sent doth go, shall sure remaine Amidst all troubles safe and free: For Christ with such will euer be. About the fourth watch of the night, Christ walked on the sea as then: And passing by them, at the sight They cried out like fearfull men, Supposing he had bene a ghost, And that they surely had bene lost. Comfort your selues then Iesus said, It is my selfe, you need not feare: Though want of faith made you affraid, Yet none of you shall loose a haire; Reioyce therefore, regard no paine, You shall haue ease for this againe. Then Peter minding him to trie, Said; maister, bid me come to thee. Then Iesus said; Come by and by, And walke on foote along to me. Out of the ship he stept straight way, As one that would his Lord obay. But when he saw a mightie winde, He sore afraide began to sinke: If helpe (he cride) I do not finde, I shall be drowned as I thinke. So want of faith, did let him fall, And faith againe, gaue grace to call. Him Iesus then reproued sore; When they into the ship were come: The sea and wind did ceasse to roare, Which seem'd a maruell vnto some: Yet all confessed verely, By this, Christ Iesus deity. When Christ had landed in the countrey of Genezareth, they brought vnto him all that were sicke, and as many as touched the hemme of his vesture were healed. Christ to Genezareth then went, Where when he came first to the shore, The countrey all with one consent, (Yea such as saw him not before,) Deuised how to bring him there, All such as then diseased were. All which desired but to tuch His garments, as he passed by: His shadow did relieue all such, As shadowed were, where they did lye. Thus did their faith bring forth much fruit, For they obtained all their suite. Lo he that lately with disdaine, Among his owne had no regard: He whom his kinsmen would haue slaine, Him truly, strangers gladly heard. His doctrine these men did embrace, And he on them shed forth his grace. Christs Sermon of Manna from heauen, and of the bread of life, at Capernaum. The people that Christ Iesus fed, Sought him till they found him againe: They sought not for the heau'nly bread, For earthly meate they tooke that paine. Striue not so for that meate, said he: Striue for the meate I shall giue thee. Then said they all what shall we do, That worke the works of God we might? Christ Iesus answered thereto, And taught them how to do it right; The worke of God (with good intent,) Is to beleeue in whom he sent. Shew vs some signe that we may see, And so beleeue in thee: they say, Our fathers Manna had, to be Their meate, in the desert alway: God gaue them bread from heau'n to eat, And it was long our fathers meat. And Iesus then said verely, Not Moses but my father he Doth giue to you assuredly, True bread from heau'n: beleeue yee me; The bread of God came downe I say, And to the world giues life alway. Then they againe to Iesus said, Giue vs this bread, Lord, euermore: The bread of life (be not affraid) I am: he shall not hunger sore, Nor thirst, that doth beleeue in me, So do not you, for all you see. They come to me whom God doth giue, And them I do not cast away: I loose not one that doth beleeue, But raise him vp at the last day. My fathers will, not mine to do, I came from heau'n this earth vnto. The Iewes did murmure he said so, (I am the bread that downe did come.) What is this Iosephs sonne or no? Is not he knowne to vs, said some? No man can come (be sure said he) But whom the father drawes, to me. Whom God hath taught, come vnto me, Not that the father sure hath bene Of any one, saue onely he Which is of God (said Iesus) seene. To him that doth in me beleeue, Life euerlasting I do giue. I am the bread of life in deed, Your fathers Manna long did eate, Yet are they dead: so shall not speed, Such as feed on this heau'nly meate. My flesh it is the bread I giue, Which is life to all that beleeue. How can this man giue vs to eate His flesh say they? can it so be? My flesh except it be your meate, And that ye drinke my bloud, said he, Eternall life I say againe, Doth not at all in you remaine. Who so doth eate my flesh, I say, And drinkes my bloud, hath life in deed: Him I will raise at the last day, But so shall not the wicked speed. My flesh and bloud is faithfully, Both meate and drinke assuredly. He that doth eate my flesh, is he, And he that drinkes my bloud withall, In whom I dwell, and he in me, As God the Father eternall Hath sent me; so, by him I liue, And life to others I do giue. From heau'n aboue came downe this bread, Not as your fathers that did eate The Manna sent them, yet are dead, For he that eateth of this meate Shall liue, and he shall neuer dye, As sinners do eternally. At Capernaum spake he this, Where some of his Disciples were, That said, a hard thing sure it is, Who can abide the same to heare? Doth this offend you then, said he? What, if I should ascend, will ye? It is the spirit that in deed Doth quicken, not the flesh be sure: In spirit, this both life doth breed And nourish, euer to endure: For what I speake (to end all strife) To you is spirit and is life. Yet some of you beleeue not this, (He knew them, and the traitour to) Therefore I told you how it is, That come vnto me any do: The father onely giues this grace To him, that doth enioy the place. So some went cleane from him away, Then Iesus said, vnto the rest; Will ye depart from me this day? And walke as they where you thinke best? Shall we said Peter, then at last? Words of eternall life thou hast. And we beleeue, and know thou art The Christ, the Sonne of God in deed: And if we did from thee depart, We should be sure, full ill to speed. Christ did againe the traitour note: Least his Apostles should forgote. Christ rebuked the Scribes and Pharisies, for trangressing Gods commandements, and answered their accusation against his Disciples, for eating meate with vnwashen hands. The Scribe and faithlesse Pharisie, Came then our Sauiour Christ vnto, Supposing by their subtiltie, For to deface what he would do. They from Hierusalem then came, That so faine would his works defame. Why thy Disciples do transgresse, Of elders the tradition, Do thou now vnto vs expresse; This was at first their question: For they (say they) wash not a hand, When they eate meate, we vnderstand. O hypocrites, said Christ againe, You do Gods word still disobay, Supposing you shall scape the paine, That you do merite day by day. He that his parents (sure saith God) Dishonoreth, shall feele my rod. In words you worship, but in vaine, Lip labour, liketh not the Lord, A double heart, he doth disdaine: When words and deeds do well accord, Then prayse and prayer he will heare, Which neuer doth in you appeare. It is not meate that hurteth man, Which with the mouth he doth consume: But euill thoughts which now and than, Do moue the heart to fret and fume, Or else deuise some euill deed: Of this ye should take greatest heed. Each plant my father planteth not, Shall by the roote be pluckt againe: Our God will not all his forgot, When hypocrites do suffer paine. These blindly still, the blind do lead, You haue no cause, their craft to dread. Christ cast a deuill out of the daughter of a woman of Canaan, and healed many other. From thence likewise did Iesus passe, Of Tyre and Sydon through the cost, Of such great care our Sauiour was. To saue that else might there be lost: He ceassed not but day by day, Did good to all that would him pray. Behold a woman, came to him, That did within those borders dwell, Whose daughter was in eu'ry lymme Sore vexed with a deu'll of hell. Christ she most earnestly did pray, From her to driue the deu'll away. Whose suite, though seeming to deny, Christ graunted vnto her at last, When that he saw how faithfully, She hop't his fauour for to tast, He gaue to her to do her good, Some portion of the childrens food. Christ returned thence againe into the costes of Galilie, healed a deaffe man that stammered in his speach and many others, and fed. 4000. men besides women and children with seuen loaues. Christ did returne yet then againe, Into the costes of Galilie, Their late contempt and deepe disdaine, Withdrew not so his pietie. Among the middest of wolues he still, Protecteth safe his flocke from ill. A deaffe man vnto Christ they brought, That stambred in his speach also: He graunted them, what then they sought, And healed him, and let him go: So that amazed in great feare, They gaue God prayse all that were there. He then vp to a mountaine went, And sate him downe vpon the same: And the people with full intent, By multitudes vnto him came, To heare his doctrine, and to craue That they some helpe of him might haue. They thither brought the lame, the blind, The deaffe, the dumbe, and maymed sort; These had as they did hope to find, Their former health, to their comfort: So that the people did reioyce, And praysed God with heart and voyce. Which caused Christ to pitie these, As he before had done also, When in the desert to their ease, He fed fiue thousand men and mo. This did he that they might perceaue, That Christ would not his chosen leaue. Wherefore he fed now once againe, Foure thousand men sure at the least, Neare Galilie on that mountaine, Where he had healed all the rest, With seu'n loaues and few fishes small, Christ Iesus fed those men withall. The Pharisies and Saduces tempted Christ, and desired him to shew them a signe. To Magdala, when this was done, By ship our Sauiour did sayle, To whom the Saducees did soone, And Pharisies without all fayle Resort, which faine a signe would see From heau'n aboue, if it would be. They could discerne the outward face, And each appearance in the skie: These hypocrites had yet no grace, But needs they would Christ Iesus trie. Those that by tempting, Christ assayle, Do most in all their fetches fayle. For those no signe at all could haue, But that of Ionas, which we reade, That lay three dayes as in a graue, Within a whale, as he were dead: The sonne of man shall euen so, Lye in the graue, and rise therefro. Christ commanded his Disciples to beware of the leauen of the Pharisies. They thence went to the other side, But had forgot to buy them bread, So farre mens fancies wander wide, When they do stray from Christ their head. These minded not that Iesus could Prouide them meate when that he would. Christ warning them to shunne alway The leauen of the Pharisie, Made them conceiue, this doth he say, Sith we forgot some bread to buy. They neuer thought how he had fed Foure thousand men with litle bread. This leauen of the Pharisie, The Saducees, and Herod to, Then his disciples warned he, They should in any wise forgo False teachers, and their doctrine flee, For they mens soules do slay yee see. Christ healed a blind man in Bethsayda. Then Iesus to Bethsayda came, Where they vnto him brought one blind, Desiring him to heale the same, For other helpe they could not finde. Out of the towne the blind led he, Where afterward he made him see. Christ Iesus spat his eyes into, And put his hands vpon him then, And said, now tell it, if thou do See any thing among these men. I see them walke as trees, said he, Though perfectly I cannot see. Christ put his hands on him againe, And bad him looke then all about. He looked, and saw each thing plaine, He stood of nothing then in doubt. Go home said Christ, sith thou art well, Of this in towne to no man tell. Peter in the name of all the Apostles, confessed Christ to be the sonne of the liuing God: to which confession Christ answered, and in his name promised vnto them all the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. When to Cæsarea Iesus came, Called Philippi, as we reade: Of his disciples then what fame He askt, of him abroad was spread? The sonne of man I am said he: What do men say therefore of me? Iohn Baptist, some name thee, they say, Elias some do thee suppose, Or Ieremias, or some way, That of the Prophets one of those That in the elder times haue beene, Is rise againe, and of them seene. But whom say ye, said Christ againe, That I the sonne of man should be? Then Simon Peter said certaine, The sonne of God we knowledge thee. Then Christ said, Simon verely, Blessed thou art, and worst thou why? To mens opinions subiect I, Most willingly my selfe do giue: Yet mine do know me perfectly, And as they know, do so beleeue; This knowledge thou couldst neuer haue, Of flesh and bloud, but God it gaue. O Peter, this confession, The ground-worke of my Church shall be: For vpon that foundation, I meane to build a Church for me. The gates of hell shall not preuaile Against the same, but still shall fayle. To you of heau'n I giue the key, That is the preaching of my word: All men that will not it obey, Against all such, draw out this sword; What so in earth ye loose or bind, The like in heau'n, the same shall find. Then charged he that they should tell, As then to no man what he were: Ere Christ we learne to know full well, We may not preach him, without feare; For though no more but man we see, Yet must we know him God to be. Christ taught the faithfull to beare his Crosse, and rebuked Peter for disswading his death. From that time forth Iesus began, To shew that he himselfe must go Vnto Ierusalem, for man To suffer and abide much wo: The elders, Priests, and Scribes had plaine Deuised all, to haue him slaine. And though he told them this before, The third day I will rise againe: Yet Peter thought it wisedome more, To keepe him thence to shunne the paine. And therefore he tooke him aside: But Christ would not his words abide. So he that late reueal'd by God. Did know and knowledge Christ his sonne, Doth straightway here deserue a rod, Not knowing yet what he had donne. When selfe-will casts Gods word behind, Our weaknesse then we quickly find. Here Peter doth presume to teach His master Christ, himselfe to saue: Christ him of follie did appeach, And so a sore rebuke him gaue. Oh Sathan come (said he) behind, On earth, not heau'n, thou set'st thy mind. Then Iesus said to them againe, If any man will follow me, He must forsake himselfe as vaine, And beare my Crosse though vext he be: If his afflictions shall be sore, Yet in the same I go before. Who so would liue still lothing paine, And yet doth seeke his life to saue, Doth loose his labour, this is plaine, Life without me he cannot haue. He that for my sake yeelds to dye, Shall saue his life eternally. What profit shall that man obtaine, That winnes the world his soule to loose? When he hath reckned all his gaine, Most vaine it is that he doth choose. For he that will not for me dye, Shall dye a death perpetually. For sure the sonne of man, he shall In glorie of his father deare, (The Angels him attending all) In iudgement here againe appeare. And then according to his deed, Shall eu'ry man be sure to speed. Yet truly vnto you I say, That some of them which here do stand, Shall not by death be fetcht away, Vntill the time be neare at hand, That in his kingdome they do see The sonne of man so come to be. Christ was transfigured on mount Thabor, in the presence of Peter, Iames, and Iohn, &amp; talked with Moses and Elyas. Saint Mathew after sixe daies said, That Iesus was transfigured: The order of it made affraid, All such as saw what happened; For he appear'd in maiestie, Surpassing their capacitie. Christ, Peter, Iames, and Iohn then tooke Into mount Thabor all apart: Where on his glory they should looke, That they might ponder it in hart: He tooke them three, for against three, Exceptions may not taken be. So as the sunne, did shine his face, His clothes were white as is the light, And two men standing in the place, With whom to talke he tooke delight: They Moses, and Elias were, That stood and talked with him there. But his disciples were afraid To looke vpon so strange a sight, This voice withall made them dismaid, That came out of the cloud forth-right, This is my sonne I loue so deare, Happy are they that do him heare. And Peter was amazed so, That he knew not the words he spake; Come Maister said he, ere we go, Three tabernacles let vs make. Be not affraid said Christ of me, For now alone you may me see. So as he came the mountaine fro, He said to them, this vision You may declare all men vnto, After my resurrection: Till then to no man may you say, What you haue seene all three this day. Why do the Scribes said they tell vs, Come needs must first Elyas be? Then Christ to them gaue answer thus, Elyas came, they could not see. And his Apostles well then wist, He had spoke this of Iohn Baptist. Christ comming downe from the mountaine, cured a child that was lunatike. When from the hill come downe they were, Among the multitude was one That said, oh master, pitie here, And helpe I pray my vexed sonne: Of thy Disciples I can haue No helpe at all, my sonne to saue. Oh crooked generation, Bring here said Christ, the child to me: How long shall in this nation, Such vnbeleefe ingraffed be? Christ then the deu'll rebuked so, That from the child he made him go. Then his Disciples secretly, Askt why they could not cast him out? It was your infidelitie, Else you had done it without doubt. Prayer and fasting it the way, Whereby this deu'll cast out you may. They came thence into Galilie, where he fore-told them of his passion, and payd tribute. Christ told them this in Galilie, The sonne of man shall giuen be, Into mens hands assuredly, For to be slaine as you shall see: Yet he the third day, shall againe Reuiue, and so for ay remaine. Then they which tribute did receiue, Came vnto Peter secretly, And said to him, we do perciue, Thy master at thy house doth lye, Tell vs therefore and if he do Pay tribute, vnto Cæsar to? Whose answer (as he thought in deed,) Was that his master payd the same: Wherefore he hy'de him home with speed, And to his master quickly came. Who then preuenting him tooke paine, To aske of him the same againe. What thinkest thou, oh Peter show Of whom do kings their tribute take? Of children? or of strangers now? Of strangers, he did answer make. By this thy reason then said he, Both thou and I may well go free. Yet lest we should them so offend, Go to the sea, and angle there: Where if thou do a while attend, A fish thou shalt take, do not feare, That in his mouth shall surely haue What they for thee and me do craue. Thus Christ to Peter twise did show, That eu'ry thing what so it were, Himselfe the same before did know: Whereby his Godhead did appeare. And therewithall example gaue, To pay the king what he should haue. The contention of the Apostles for the primacie, Christes answere, and warning against offences. Then his Disciples did demand, Who should in heau'n the greatest be? Christ did a litle child command To stand, and said, lo here you see, In heau'n the greatest is the mild, That humbleth him as doth a child. Offend not these, whose Angels see, And do behold my fathers face: Though that offences needs must be, Yet sure offenders do want grace. Cut of the hand, plucke out the eye, If that offences come thereby. Of forgiuing our brethren. But if thy brother thee offend, Seeke thou to winne him priuatly: If thee he heare not, nor amend, Go yet, and warne him earnestly: If then he do not heare the same, Before the Church let him haue blame. Then Peter came to him, and said, When that my brother doth offend, Shall I when he doth seeme affrayd, Forgiue him seu'n times, if he mend? Not seu'n times, but as oft (said he) As he repents, let him go free. By you on earth what so is bound, Or loosed likewise by you is, The same in heau'n shall so be found. Two their requests shall haue iwis, Where in my name meete two or three, I in the middst will surely be. The example of the king receiuing accounts of his seruants, and the reward of crueltie. A certaine king would take accounts, Among his seruants Iesus said: And one was brought whose debt surmounts Ten thousand talents, all dismayd. Of this, the mightie king could say, Sell him and his, my debts to pay. But when the seruant cryed grace, Desiring him a longer day: He said not, go thou for a space, But I forgiue, go hence away. This king so full of pietie, May teach vs to vse clemencie. But the same seruant met his mate, That ought to him an hundred pence: He straight not waighing his estate, Nor yet regarding the offence, Put him in prison that did pray, Without respect, till he would pay. His felowes saw, and sorie were, And told their master of the same, Who would not long this fact forbeare, But payd him like for like, with shame. Till all were payd, withouten fayle: He sent that seruant then to iayle. So likewise shall my father do, (Said Christ) except you do forgiue, Yea from your hearts your brethren to, Their faults, whereat you so much grieue: For as you hope of him to haue, So graunt them grace, that grace will craue. Christ his iourney out of Galilie into Iudea, and his Sermons in the Temple at the feast of Tabernacles. Christ did depart from Galilie, And to Iudea came againe, Where as he passed Iordan by: While in that cost he did remaine, (As gratiously he vsd to deale) Their sicke and lame he then did heale. Then came to him the Pharisie, Full fraughted both in hart and minde, With craft, and cloakt hypocrisie, Hoping in Christ some fault to find. But still for all his taken toyle, Ere he departs he hath the foyle. The feast of Tabernacles then, Was kept with great solemnitie, Vnto the which those countrey men, Did vse to go continually: That feast was euen then at hand, Which they gaue Christ to vnderstand. His brethren to him therefore say, Depart hence, and to Iurie go, That thy Disciples there they may, See all thy works, that here we do. For none in secret workes the same, That being know'n sets forth his fame. My time is not yet come, said he, But your time alwayes ready is: The world loues you, and hateth me, Because it doth all things amisse. Go ye that are thereto addrest: I will not yet go the feast. These things he said, abiding still In Galilie, behind the rest, Till he his time might there fulfill: Yet after he came to the feast, Though secretly, which made the Iewes To muse, they heard of him no newes. Some cald' him good, some other bad, And said he doth but men deceiue: When halfe the feast was done, yet glad Were some our Sauiour to receiue. Christ taught, the Iewes did maruaile how He should vntaught the Scriptures know. My doctrine is his that sent me, If any man will do his will, Gods word he shall know it to be, And that I must the same fulfill. Vnrighteousnesse in him was none, He sought Gods glorie not his owne. Did Moses geue to you a law? And none of you doth keepe the same? And yet as men that stood in awe, For breach therefore ye do me blame. Yea more then that, ye would me kill, That onely do my fathers will. Thou hast the deu'll, said they againe, Who goeth about to kill thee here? One worke I did, I tell you plaine, You maruell at, on may with feare. You Circumcise them Sabboth day: I made one whole, ye would me slay. Iudge not as outwardly you see, But righteous iudgement iudge withall: Is not this man (said some) eu'n he Whose death they haue decreed all? Do not the rulers see plainly, That he now speaketh openly? This man from whence he is know we, Whence Christ shall come we cannot tell: Whence I am come ye know, said he, Him that sent me ye know not well: But I know him, and he sent me; I am of him, so are not ye. They sought to take him, but did lay No hands on him, his houre as then Was not come, to make him away. Some said, beleeuing of those men, When Christ comes shall his works be mo? Or greater then we see him do? The Pharisies and high Priests sent Their officers Christ for to take: A litle while now be content, Said Christ, my iourney hence I make: To him that sent me will I go, You (seeking) shall find me no mo. Now whither will he, said the Iewes? That we shall not find him againe? If to the Grecians that were newes. This thing they would haue learned faine; Ye shall seeke me, but shall not find, Nor come to me, in deed or mind. Now in the last day of the feast, Christ stood, and cryde to them, and said, If any thirst, lo I am prest To giue him drinke, be not affrayd, In him that doth beleeue in me, A well of life shall springing be. This of the spirit they should receiue, That would beleeue in, him he spake, Although the Iewes did not perceiue, Nor great account of Iesus make. When Christ was glorified then, The holy Ghost was giuen men. So many when they heard this, said, This is the Prophet certainly: Some other not so much affrayd, Said, he was Christ apparantly. Of other minds againe were some, From Galilie Christ should not come. Saith not the Scripture, of the seed Of Dauid, Christ shall come to thee? And out of Bethlehem in deed, Where Dauid was, thou shalt him see? Each lik't his owne opinion Of Christ, which bred dissention. Some would he should then taken be, Yet no man layd on him a hand: The rulers all did so agree, And so their officers command. Of whom they askt the reason why, Christ was not taken by and by? The seruants said, assuredly, Man neuer yet like this man spake. The rulers answerd bitterly, Ye are deceiu'd and much mistake. What trust do wisemen to him giue, Though the vnlearned him beleeue? Then Nicodemus said, our law Doth iudge no man, before it heare What he hath done of him in awe. Art thou said they? what doest thou feare? Search well and looke, from Galilie Comes not one Prophet verely. Then eu'ry man went to his home, And to the mount of Oliues he That night did go, it seemes to some, He went to pray, yet other be Of mind, he went to take his rest In Bethanie, where he thought best. A woman taken in adulterie brought to Christ, was deliuered by him from her accusers. And early in the morning came Into the temple Christ againe: Yea all the people saw the same, Christ sate him downe and taught them plaine, But marke the craft and subtiltie, Of Scribe and froward Pharisie. Though they had by temptation, Assaild him oft, and had the fall: A new deuise they hammer on, To tempt our Sauiour Christ withall. A woman in adulterie Was found, the act did verifie. They brought her vnto him, and said, Moses commandeth in the law, No time therein should be delayd, To stone such as liue not in awe. But master what doest thou suppose, That God would haue vs do with those? Then Iesus stouped to the ground, And with his finger wrote thereon: The Scribes still asking him were found, Some answer to their question. He that sinnes not, let him not stay, Cast the first stone at her he may. They hearing this, no longer muse, They go out eu'ry one away: Their conscience did them so accuse, To punish her they would not stay. And Iesus was there left alone With her, and she condemn'd by none. Sith no man hath condemned thee, Go hence said Christ, and sinne no more: Misliking her adulterie, Which sure he would haue punisht sore, But that repentance by her face, He saw in her, had got his grace. Christ is the true light of the world. Of this world sure I am the light, For him to walke that followeth me: Yea cleare shall be the darkest night, The light of life that man shall see. Thou of thy selfe doest record beare, It is not true, we therefore feare. Then Iesus said, though I do so, My record yet is true in deed: For whence I came, and where I go, I know, to learne I haue no need. This thing from you so hidden is, Because ye iudge each thing amisse. I iudge no man, yet if I do, My iudgement ye the truth shall find: For I alone do nothing so, I still am of my fathers mind. The father is alwayes with me, Two witnesses allowed be. Where is thy father then, say they? Ye know him not, nor will know me: You all the sonne do disobey, And yet the father faine would see. He that doth seeke the sonne to know, To him I do the father show. Iesus spake in the treasurie, As he within the Temple taught, These sayings all most constantlie, And yet no man Christ Iesus caught. His houre vncome, no man there could (For all their spight) on him take hold. Then Iesus said, I go my way, Ye shall seeke me, yet dye in sinne: You cannot come to me I say, Your wickedednesse so wraps you in. Will he said they himselfe go kill, That he saith so? what is his will? Ye from beneath, I from aboue, Ye of this world, I am not thence: Your sinnes, said Christ, I cannot loue, In them you dye, departing hence, Except your faith vnfained be, And ye beleeue that I am he. Who art thou then, said they againe? The same said he, I told before: And many things of you remaine To say, and iudge, that grieue me sore. Yet true is he that sent me here, Whose words to speake I do not feare. They vnderstood not, he spoke this To them as of the father then: When ye lift vp the sonne iwis, Then shall I be well knowne to men, That of my selfe I do, nor say, But as my father makes the way. For he that sent me is with me, The father left me not alone: My doings all directeth he, Him please I, and we both are one. As he spake these things, many were, That then beleeued on him there. Christ said, to those that did beleeue, In my word if ye do abide Ye my Disciples are, I giue You knowledge of the truth beside, And the same truth shall make you free, That are so ioynd in league with me. They said we be of Abrahms seed, And neuer yet to any bound: Why sayst thou then ye shall be freed, As we had bene in slau'rie found? I say, said he, who so doth sinne, Sinnes seruant is, it wraps him in. Of freedome, or the difference betweene the sonne and the seruant. The seruant doth but soiourne here: The sonne doth in the house abide. They that the sonne shall free, are cleare And shall be free at eu'ry tide. I know ye are of Abrahms seede, Ye seeke to kill me yet in deede. And why, in you can take no place My words, I speake that I haue seene With my father: you voyde of grace, With your father to long haue beene; Ye follow him, the deuill I say, And therefore seeke ye me to slay. Abrah'm said they, our father is. Christ said, if ye his children were, Ye would his works then do, not this, Ye would to kill me stand in feare, This did not Abraham, sure I haue Told you the truth, which God me gaue. Your fathers works you do in deed: They said, of fornication We were not borne, we are Gods seed, And other father haue we none. If God were he, ye would loue me: For I came forth from, God said he. I came not of my selfe, but sent, My talke why do you not perceiue? Because my word with good intent, Ye do not heare nor yet receiue. The deu'll your father is, whose lust You do, and in him onely trust. A murtherer he euer was, And did the truth most deadly hate: For lyes all other he doth passe, This is your fathers dreadfull state. Because I tell the truth said he, Ye wickedly beleeue not me. Who can of sinne rebuke me here? The truth why do ye not beleeue? He heareth Gods word with much feare, That is of God, and so doth liue. Ye heare it not therefore said he, Because of God none of you be. The Iewes then answering said againe, Samaritan, a deuill thou hast: I haue no deuill I tell you plaine, My father whom away ye cast, I honour, ye dishonour me, Which your decay no doubt will be. And I seeke not so much my prayse, But there is one that seeks the same: And iudgeth you, and all your wayes, Whose iudgement you may neuer blame. The man that keeps my word, I say, Shall see no death, nor dying day. A deu'll we know thou hast in deed, For Abraham is dead and gone: So did the Prophets likewise speed, And yet thou sayst, there shall not one That keeps thy word, death tast or see; But from his dart, thou keepst him free. Then Abraham which now is dead, And all the Prophets, dead also, Whose fame so farre abroad was spread, Art thou greater then they or no? Whom makest thou thy selfe to be? Tell vs, that we may honour thee. Iesus said, if I honour me, My honour is nought worth at all: My father doth the same, said he, Which you your God in vaine do call; Ye know him not: but him know I, If I said no, then should I lye. I know him, and his word I keepe, Your father Abrahm did reioyce, To see before he fell on sleepe, My day, and so to heare my voyce. He saw it, and thereof was glad: Ye want the grace your father had. Thou art not old yet fiftie yeare, Hast thou our father Abrahm seene? Though this so strange to you appeare, Before he was, I sure haue beene. They tooke vp stones to stone him then: But Iesus hid him from those men. Christ gaue sight to one that was borne blind. And as Christ Iesus passed by, When he out of the Temple went, Where then the Iewes most cruelly, To stone our Sauiour Christ had ment. He saw a blind man by the way, That had bene blind from his birth day. And his Disciples asked thus, Oh master, who did sinne we pray? He or his parents, tell it vs? That he is blind, what doest thou say? Then Iesus said, nor they, nor he, But that all men Gods works might see. His works, I must worke, that sent me, While it is day, the night comes on: I am the light while here I be, When I go hence, the light is gone: And so he spat and made the clay, Which curde his blindnesse cleane that day. Then Christ said, go, in Siloam wash, Lo, I haue sent thee so to do: Which when he did, his eyes as glasse Were made as cleare, and seeing to. The neighbours that knew him before, To see him see, did wonder sore. Some said, and thought that it was he, Some other thought him like the same: But he confest himselfe to be, Borne blind, and spread Christ Iesus fame. For whom (said he) you Iesus call, Hath made me see, as you see all. They said, how op'ned he thine eyes? Mine eyes he did annoint with clay: And then he said to me arise, Go wash the same from thee away. I washt, and then receiued sight, Which neuer saw before the light. Where Christ was then, he could not tell, They brought him to the Pharisies: Though Christ had done but all things well, In opening the blind mans eyes, They chaft, that Christ should worke the clay, To heale him on the Sabboth day. The Pharisees askt him the same, He answer'd, as he did before. From God (said they) he neuer came, That makes not of the Sabboth more. Some said, how can he sinfull be? That workes such workes as we do see? Then asked they the blinde againe, Tell vs of him what doest thou say? He said he is a Prophet plaine, That wrought this worke on me this day. They scarse beleeu'd he had beene blind, Till they had knowne his parents mind. Of them his parents were afraid, Because they had decreed so, Who so confessed Christ, they said, Out of their Sinagogue should go. Our sonne he is, borne blinde he was, Let him tell how this came to passe. Then called they the blind againe, And said to God the glory giue: He is a sinner this is plaine, Though he thy griefe did so relieue. I know not if he sinfull be: Once I was blind, and now I see. How op'ned he thine eyes, say they? I told you once, and hard you not? Would yee his doctrine now obey? Or else haue yee so soone forgot? They checkt him, saying, Moses we, Not his disciples, sure will be. God spake to Moses, this we know, This man we know not whence he is. The blinde man answer'd, now I trow, Ye doubt not that he hath done this: And this to all men may appeare, That God will not a sinner heare. It was not since the world began, Hard that his eyes were opened, That was borne blind; and now a man, But that of God it happened. If he were not of God, said he, He could not haue done this for me. In sinnes (they said) borne sure thou art, Doest thou teach vs what we shall do? They cast him out: he did depart, When Iesus heard they had done so, He said to him, wilt thou beleeue, Now in the sonne of God and liue? Who is he Lord, that so I may, Beleeue in him as thou would'st haue? It is my selfe, Christ did then say. Lord I beleeue, helpe me I craue. Christ said, I make the blind to see, And seeing blind, that loue not me. Some of the Pharisies were there, Which hard these words, and thus said then, Are we blinde? how doth that appeare? The blinde are not such sinfull men; But now ye say that yee do see, Your sinnes remaine therefore, said he. Of the true shepheard and the hireling. And that they might the better know Their state, and so consider his, Christ in a parable did showe The faithfull Shepheard who he is: The hireling Iesus did bewray, And theefe, that liues vpon the pray. Verely, verely, I do say, He that into the sheepfold goes, Beside the doore some other way: May well be counted one of those, That comes to rob and steale the sheepe, Which other men haue charge to keepe. But he that goes in by the doore, Is sure the sheepheard of the flocke: To him the porter euermore, Doth ope assoone as he doth knock; To call his sheepe he doth reioyce, The sheepe likewise to heare his voyce. When that his owne sheepe forth are sent He goeth before: they follow fast, His voice they know, and what he meant Their perill he before doth cast. A stranger they will surely flee, By voice they know him strange to be. They vnderstood not all he said, Therefore Christ said to them againe, My sheepe may safely vnaffraid, Voide of all dangers so remaine. I am the doore of all my sheepe, And care most safely them to keepe. All that before me came, said he, (That is, such as I haue not sent, And such as faine them Christ to be) The theeues and robbers are I meant. But sure the sheepe heare not their voice, Though to heare mine, my sheepe reioyce. By me (the doore) if any do Enter therein, shall saued be: He in and out shall freely go, And pasture finde that followes me. The theefe doth steale, destroy, and kill, I came to saue my sheepe from ill. I the good shepheard surely am, That giue my life to saue my sheepe: An hireling hath thereof no shame, To see the Wolfe, and take no keepe; He leaueth them: the Wolfe doth catch, Destroying one at eu'ry snatch. The hireling fleeth, he serues for hire, And therefore cares not for the sheepe, But that t[illeg is not my desire: The good Sheapheard takes little sleepe, And I am [illeg.] my sheepe I know, And so [illeg.] knowne of mine, I trow. So as the father knoweth me, So I do him: and for my sheepe My life I lay downe; and there be Another flocke that I must keepe: As yet of this flock are not they, When I call them, they will obey. My Father loueth me the more, Because I do my life downe lay, That I might it againe restore. No man takes it from me away: To lay and take I power haue, But this precept my father gaue. Among the Iewes dissention grew, For these his sayings then againe: He should be mad, if some said true, And haue a deuill: some other plaine Confest his words and workes to be No deuillish deeds, to make men see. Three feasts of dedication, We finde in scripture there haue beene The first, solemniz'd Solomon, In haruest time this feast was seene. Then Ezra next, did keepe the same In Spring, when they from Babell came. Then Iudas Macchabeus he, Lastly this feast solemnized In winter: and the same decree, Till Christes time so continued. When Iesus walkt (which tooke small rest) In Solomons porch, this was the feast. The Iewes came there him round about, If thou be Christ, now tell vs plaine, How long doest thou keepe vs in doubt? Then Iesus answerd againe; Ye trust not what I told: yet see That my works do witnesse with me. Yea, yee beleeue not, for ye are Not of my sheepe: mine heare my voice; I know them, and for them I care, To follow me they will reioyce. Eternall life to them I geue, They perish not, with me they liue. My father which gaue them to me, Is greater then all, this I know. And in my fathers hand they be, None can thence take them as I trow. I and my father sure are one. The Iewes againe thought him to stone. Then Iesus said, good works I haue Shewd from my father verely: For which of them now do I craue, Would you stone me so cruelly? For the good worke no stone cast we; Thou being but man, God makest thee. If that the Psalmist Gods them call, To whom Gods word then giuen was, The Scripture faultlesse yet withall, Do I blaspheme? or so trespasse? To say that I Gods sonne should be? Sent to the world, as here ye see. If I do not my fathers workes, Beleeue me not: but if I do, In you some hidden hatred lurkes, That wilfully the truth forgo. Beleeue the works that ye do see, The father works the same by me. So then ye shall know and beleeue, That sure in me the father is: And I in him, yea he doth giue To me all power that is his. They sought then to put him in bands: But he escapt out of their hands. Now when the Iewes he scaped fro, He passed Iordan, then againe Where Iohn Baptized he did go, And there a while he did remaine. There many did to him resort, And did receiue of him comfort. Though all Ierusalem of pride, And deepe disdaine did Christ refuse, Yet there where then he did abide, They did our Sauiour better vse. What Iohn of him had spoke before, They knowledgd, praysing God the more. Thus many conflicts Iesus had, With froward foolish Pharisies: All which might make his chosen glad, That he obtaind such victories. To God let vs the honour giue, That did our weakenesse so relieue. Giue glorie vnto God on high, To Father, and so to the Sonne: See that the same perpetually, Vnto the holy Ghost be donne, Which is, and was, and so shalbe, One mightie God in persons three. Amen. THE FIFTH PART OF THE HISTORIE OF OVR LORD AND SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST, containing those things which he did the fourth yeare after his Baptisme, which was the three &amp; thirtieth yeare of his age, according to the foure Euangelistes: the yeare after the creation of the world. 4174. To the tune of the Lordes Prayer. The time of Christs departure approching, he confirmed himselfe to go to Hierusalem. When Christ had now accomplished The time appointed him before, And that his death then hastened, He did prepare himselfe therefore: His minde he fully setled tho, Thence to Ierusalem to go. Wherefore he did before him send, A lodging for him to prepare, Of such as did him then attend, Which they did with exceeding care. Within Samaria entred they, Into a towne for to puruey. But the Samaritans in deed, Their message would not then receiue, When him and his they (with such speed) Go to Ierusalem perceiue. This was the cause, for all their care, They could no lodging there prepare. When Iohn and Iames that then were sent, Saw they could not prouided be: Shall we said they, incontinent, Command as did Elias he, That fire come downe from heauen hye, And so consume them vtterly? Iesus rebuking them, did say, Know ye not yet what men ye are? The sonne of man came not to slay, But saue mens liues, whereof haue care. So to another towne they went, For then the day was almost spent. Christes answer to the Scribe that would haue followed him. A Scribe came then to Christ and said, Oh master I will follow thee. For answer he was not delayd; The foxes haue their holes ye see, And fowles their neasts, said he, but I Haue not a place wherein to lye. Christes answer to the Disciple that would go burie his father first. But to another Christ said then, Come thou forthwith and follow me: Thus calleth he vs mortall men, Whom when, and how best like th he, My dutie first discharge must I, To my old father till he dye. And Iesus said to him againe, Let thou the dead their dead bury: For my Disciple must remaine, And do his office carefully. Go thou therefore abroad, I say, Preach the kingdome of God alway. Christes answer to a third that would follow him, but would first bid his houshold farewell. Another said, ile follow thee, But first I must go bid farewell, To such as be in house with me; But Iesus said, he doth not well, That to the plough doth put his hand, And looketh backe, and lets it stand. Christ sent forth the seuentie Disciples to preach. After these things appointed he, Of his Disciples seuentie mo, That still were wont with him to be, And sent them forth by awd two, Where he would come, before they went, To do and teach, as they were sent. The haruest is surely said he, Now verie great, yet few I say, Do labour in the same, pray ye The Lord thereof to send away Some labourers for to take paine, That by his haruest he may gaine. Behold, I send you, go away, As lambes among the wolues ye be: As simple as the doues, I say, And as the Serpent wise be ye. Do in your iourney take no care, What weeds ye were, or how ye fare. What house, or Citie ye come to, Among the worthie there remaine, Till you from thence haue cause to go, Let them with you my peace retaine. Such as do not deserue this grace, Shake of their dust in the same place. This dust shall witnesse against those, That you desired not their wealth; And that they earthly treasure chose, Before this proffred sauing health. And in the iudgement they shall gaine, Of Sodome and Gomorh the paine. Chorazin wo be vnto thee, And to Bethsayda wo likewise: The great works that were done by me In you, ye greatly did despise: If they in Tyrus had bene done, They had repented long agone. If Tyre and Sydon had, I say, Both seene and heard what ye do heare, Sack-cloth and ashes eu'ry day Had bene their weed: you buy it deare, For at the iudgement, then to thee, To them it shall more easie be. Thou Capernaum lift so hye, Yea raised vp to heau'n aboue, To hell thou shalt be brought to lye, Because my works thee neuer moue: If they in Sodom had bene wrought, It had not yet bene brought to nought. For Sodom it shall easier be, (Oh Capernaum be thou sure) At the great iudgement, then for thee, The punishment for to endure. Tyre, Sydon, and Sodom shall haue, More ease then these, though then ye craue. He that doth heare you, heareth me: He that despiseth you also Despiseth me, and likewise he Despiseth God whom I came fro. They do aright in God reioyce, That in his Preachers heare his voyce. The seuentie returned, and told Christ all that they had done. The seu'ntie did returne with ioy, And told the Lord what they had done: The deuils (said they) could none annoy Or hurt, where we to preach begonne: For eu'ry where we through thy name, His rage and furie soone did tame. Christ said, I Sathan did behold, Like lightning downe from heauen fall: To you I power giue (be bold) To tread on Serpents great or small, And Scorpions: yea the enemy Shall not hurt you assuredly. In this yet do not ye reioyce, That spirits to you subiect are, But lift both hands, both heart, and voyce To God which hath of you such care. That he your names hath written sure, In heau'n, for euer to endure. Then Iesus said, I giue to thee, Oh mightie Lord and father deare, Most hartie thankes, thou hearest me, And to my call thou giuest eare: These things thou hidest from the wise, Their worldly wit thou doest despise. Thy secrets vnto babes withall, And humble men thou doest declare: These do on thee for mercy call, These, these oh God thy chosen are. This thy good pleasure was, and is, Oh father, none can alter this. All things to me now giuen are Of my father, the sonne, and he, No mortall man can well declare The one of them, except he be Taught by the sonne, and so he may Learne both to know, this is the way. To his Disciples turned he, And secretly to them did say, The eyes are blessed that do see, As ye do see, now at this day. Prophets and Kings wisht to see so And here what you do long ago. A Scribe or Lawyer tempting Christ, was answered his question, and taught who his neighbour was. A certaine Lawyer stood vp then, And tempting Christ began to say: Oh master, thou doest teach these men, To euerlasting life the way. Vouchsafe to tell it I do craue, Eternall life how I may haue. What is written said Christ againe? And in the law what doest thou reade? Thou shalt (said he) with euery vaine The Lord thy God both loue and dread: And next the Lord thy God aboue, Thy neighbour, thou shalt likewise loue. Thou hast said well, said Christ in deed, Go thou and do this, thou shalt liue: But he in hope of better speed, A new assault to Christ would giue. Who is my neighbour then said he? This thing I would faine learne of thee. Then Iesus answering, said so, A certaine man went by the way That leadeth downe to Iericho, Where among theeues he fell that day: Robbed, and wounded, there he was, And left halfe dead so on the grasse. By chance a Priest came by that way, Which when he saw him, passed by: Likewise a Leuite where he lay, Did looke on him, and let him lye. But a Samaritan by chaunce, Came by, and saw him in his traunce. Which sight, so mouing then his heart, He tooke on him compassion: Whereof before he did depart, He made full declaration, He powred in (and also bound) Both wine and oyle into his wound. And not contented yet with this, He set him vp, on his owne beast, And brought him to an inne of his, Where he prouided for his rest: And on the morow ere he went, He told the host his whole intent. Lo take these two pence that I giue, Haue care of this man I thee pray: His wants therewith do thou relieue, What more he spends, I will thee pay. Which thinkest thou now of these three, To him most neighbour-like to be? The Lawyer answering, did say, The mercifull was euen he. Go thou said Christ, then hence away, And do as this man teacheth thee; To eu'ry one in miserie, Shew thou like liberalitie. Marie and Martha entertaine Christ. Now as they further passed on, Into a certaine towne they came, Where was the habitation, Of one that Martha had to name: Who to her house receiued tho, Christ and those that with him did go. Her sister, Marie men did call, Which also sate at Iesus feete And heard his preaching as then all Most heedfully, as it was meete. But Martha was most busily Prouiding for the company. Martha therefore to Iesus said, Master regardest not thou this? That all the care on me is layd, And that my sister sitting is? Bid her therefore that she helpe me, So shalt thou better serued be. And Iesus answerd her againe, Oh Martha, Martha thou hast care, For many things put thee to paine, And helpers very needfull are: The good part Marie chose in deed, And she there after sure shall speed. Christ rising from prayer, was requested of one of his Disciples, to teach them, as Iohn taught his Disciples, to pray. As Iesus was praying with his, In the desert as some suppose, Which vnto Ephraim nearest is, And from his prayers as he rose, Of his Disciples one, did say, Teach vs (as Iohn taught his) to pray. He soone of him had his request, He was not long enforc'd to craue: Christs readinesse, this well exprest, As he to them example gaue: In their distresse both night and day, That they (as he them taught) should pray. Our father which in heauen art, Thy name be euer sanctified: Thy kingdome come: with all my heart, I wish the same accomplished. Thy will in earth be done we pray, As thine, in heau'n do it alway. Our daily bread giue vs this day, Our sinnes also to vs forgiue: As we our debters do, I say, That vs in any wise do grieue. Let vs by no illusion, Be lead into temptation. But Lord, from euill vs defend, And gratiously deliuer all: That we which do on thee depend, By frailtie from thee neuer fall. Graunt these requests (oh Lord) we pray, To vs and thy whole Church alway. Amen. Moreouer Christ vnto them said, Which of you all shall haue a friend, And shall when he in bed is layd, Haue cause to go to him, or send, And say a friend to me is come, Bread I haue none now lend me some. And he within should answer so, Why doest thou trouble me I say, I pray thee to some other go, I must at this time say thee nay; The doore is shut, my children be In bed, I cannot come to thee. I say though he would not arise, Nor thee regard as should a friend, Yet when he seeth thee in such wise, Importunat he will thee lend, Of bread or meate what thou doest craue, Or what thy need requires to haue. Aske then it shall be giuen thee, And they that seeke, shall surely finde, Knock, I will open then, said he, For God to them that call is kinde: He loueth such men verely, As pray vnto him heartely. If you for bread, giue not a stone, Nor for a fish, a serpent send, When that your sonnes for want do mone; If good things you do giue and lend, How much more shall the father he, Giue good gifts if thou aske, to thee? Christ cast out a deuill, and the dumbe man spake. Then they brought vnto Iesus one, Possessed with a deuill, that day, And him for helpe they call vpon, The man was dumbe withall, I say. Though these impediments had he, Yet with a word, Christ made him free. The multitude amazed were, And praised God with heart and voice: The sonne said they of Dauid here, Doth giue vs cause for to reioyce; And now assured all we be, That Christ the Lord, the same is he. A woman that his workes did see, And heard how he taught great and small, Said, blest is the wombe that bare thee, And pappes that gaue thee suck withall. But Christ said, blest they rather are, That Gods word heare, and keepe with care. The Iewes required a signe. Christ to the people said againe, This wicked generation, Adulterous and verie vaine, Though signes they do depend vpon, No signe to them shall giuen be, But that of Ionas they shall see. As to the Niniuites was he, That three dayes in the Whale did lie: The sonne of man shall shortly be, The like to these assuredly: The signe that Ionas to them gaue, I shall giue these, so long in graue. The men of Niniuie shall rise, And these condemne assuredly: They did not Ionas words despise, But did repent immediatly. A greater then Ionas is here, Yet small repentance doth appeare. The Queene of Saba she shall rise In iudgement with these men also: And them she shall condemne likewise, That so farre from her home would go, To heare king Solomon: I say, His greater you do heare this day. Christ dining with one of the Pharisies, and misliked for eating with vnwashen hands, answered them, and rebuked their hypocrisie. As Iesus taught the people then, There came to him a Pharisie, Requesting him and all his men, To dine with him immediatly. Then he went in with him to meate, And sitting downe, began to eate. But when the Pharisie did see, That Christ sat downe, vnwasht before, He maruaild what the cause might be, For they did vse it euermore. They sit not downe at all to meate, But first they wash before they eate. Indeed said Christ to him againe, Ye do make cleane the vtter side Of cup or platter, all in vaine, Bewraying still your foolish pride: But they within are not the lesse, Of bribrie full, and all excesse. Ye fooles made not the very same, The inside and the out also? Giue almes therefore, and leaue for shame, To be so tied your toyes vnto. Relieue the poore when they do craue, And cleane shall be all that ye haue. Woe be to you ye Scribes, I say, And Pharisies so full of guile: Ye hypocrites is this the way, To cloake your cursed craft so vile? Ye keepe the least the law doth will, And leaue the great things vnkept still. Mint, Annise, and Cummin tith'd be, And waightier matters left alone; The law commaundeth these to thee, But last of all to thinke vpon. For iudgement, mercy, and faith are The chiefest things should be your care. Woe be to you ye Scribes also, The highest seats ye all do loue In Synagogues, and where ye go, And that men in the markets moue With reuerence to greete you there, Or giue you place, and praise elsewhere. Woe be to you, for sure ye be, Like painted tombes in outward sight, Appearing faire, to them that see No part within, how they are dight. For dead mens bones lie there doubtlesse, Within them full; and filthinesse. A Lawyer answer'd him againe, Oh maister, thou in saying so, Rebukest vs likewise as vaine, And subiect with them to like woe. Christ said to him it cannot be, That you of all men should go free. For heauie burdens ye do binde, And on mens shoulders them do lay, Most greeuous to be borne in minde, Intollerable eu'ry way: But you your selues will not once proue, With any finger them to moue. Woe be to you that build so braue The Prophets tombes that were before, And garnish outwardly each graue Of righteous men now more and more. And more then that, you verely Thus vtter your iniquitie. If we had bene aliue, ye say, In our forefathers time, had we Consented so to be the day, That so much bloud then spilt should be? No, no, the Prophets should not so Haue di'de or suffred any wo. So then ye are as witnesses Vnto your selues, how that ye be Their children (as ye do confesse) That murdred them: therefore do ye What lacked of their cruelty, Performe with all dexterity. God said, behold, I will you send Both Prophets, and Apostles sure, To see if that you will amend, Yet you will not their words endure: You will them kill and crucifie, And persecute most busily: That on you all the bloud may come, Which was shed vpon earth, I say, From righteous Abell Adams sonne, To Zacharias bloud, which lay Betweene the temple verely, And the Altar, slaine cruelly. Martha and Marie sent Iesus word that their brother Lazarus was sicke. Lazarus sure as then did lie Sore sicke, and neare his death indeed: This man he dwelt in Bethany, His sisters both of him tooke heede: Martha the first, then Marie shee, They were belou'd of Christ all three. (Christs feete annointed Mary sure, And wiped with her haire the same: The oyle was costlie, sweete and pure, Her fact Christ did defend from blame:) These women did for Iesus send, And said, come helpe thy sickly friend. This sicknesse Iesus then did say, (Is for Gods glory) not to death: The sonne of God must by this way, (Who takes and giues men life and breath) Assure your selues be glorifi'd, Which thing Christ shortly verifi'd. Now Iesus loued Martha well, Her sister and her brother to: Yet he there after this did dwell Two daies ere he to them would go: And did as he had done before, There, heale and teach men more and more. The Pharisies question of diuorcement and mariage, answered of Christ. As Christ departed Galily, And to Iudea came againe: And as he passed Iordan by, While in that coast he did remaine, As graciouslie he vs'd to deale, Their sicke and lame he there did heale. Then came to him the Pharisie, Full fraughted both in heart and minde With craft and cloakt hypocrisie, Hoping in Christ some fault to finde: But still for all their taken toile, The Pharisies receiu'd the foile. May man his wife, Sir, put away For euerie cause he can deuise? Haue ye not read, then Christ did say, (Or Gods decree do ye despise?) That they were male and female fram'd, When Adam the first man was nam'd? Therefore a man shall loue his wife, Though he his father should forsake: With her he, needs must lead his life, They both by promise that they make Become one flesh; and so remaine, Though they in persons still are twaine. Let no man put a sunder then, All such as God hath coupled so, Though Moses haue allow'd some men Their maried wiues for to forgo: From the beginning (sure I say) It was not as it is this day. Truly for whoredome she may be Diuorced, and so may the man, If he commit adultery, Nor afterward well mary can: For which of both this part doth play, Should single liue, till death say nay. If it be so, of man and wife, It were not good to mary then: Yet some so borne, chast lead their life: Some are made chast also by men, Some chast themselues, who can perceiue, Let him this doctrine so receiue. Iesus among other other things that he taught his Disciples, declared vnto them the parable of the rich man that so much delighted and trusted in his riches. While Iesus his Disciples taught, The Leauen of the Pharisie To shunne with care, for it was naught. He called it Hypocrisie, And will'd them to teach openly, What he had taught them priuatly. Feare ye not man, but God, sayd he, Before men likewise me confesse, And you shall well assured be, I will to you like loue expresse: Before Gods Angels verily, I will confesse you constantly. Blasphemous words auoide withall, And for your selues take ye no care, God will heare you when ye shall call, Of him your haires all numbred are. When Princes vexe you for my sake, In worth do you your troubles take. Then sayd one of the company, Maister, command I do pray thee, The liuing now immediatly, My brother may deuide with me. A Iudge, or a deuider who Made me, sayd Christ, I should do so? Wherefore said Christ to them againe, Take heed beware of greedinesse, Abundance here is all but vaine, It worketh man but heauinesse; A man for all his riches may Prolong his life, no, not a day. The grounds of a rich man, said he, Brought him forth fruites most plenteously, Therefore he thought, what then might be Done, in such great prosperity. I haue (said he) no roome to lay My fruits, such store I haue to day. This thing (sayd he) sure will I do, I will now all my barnes downe pull, And greater build: and thereunto Gather my fruits, till they be full; I haue deuised this therefore, Because my grounds do yeeld such store. I to my soule will also say, Soule, thou hast much goods layd in store For many yeares: liue now I may At more ease then I did before: From henceforth soule eate, drinke and play, This worke shalt thou do euerie day. But God said vnto him againe, Thou foole, this night ile fetch from thee, That soule of thine, that is so vaine, Whose then shall all thy riches be? So shall it euer be with those, That too much trust in wealth repose. Therefore take you no thought I say, How you shall make prouision, But giue your selues to learne the waye, That leadeth to saluation Almes, watching, and all wisedome ye Shall vse, and with all men agree. The parable of the watchfull seruant. A faithfull seruant and a wise, Made ruler of his maisters men, His maisters trust will not despise, But feedeth them in season then When he is absent; as he were, Still present with his seruants there. That seruant happy is in deed, Whom his master when he doth come, Shall finde so doing, he shall speed, Be sure of some especiall roome. His master will make him therefore, Ruler of all he hath in store. But if the euill seruant say, My master will not come as yet, And smite his fellowes day by day, And still with drunkards drinke and eate, His master will come, when that he Expecteth not him for to see. And will cut him of from the rest, And giue to him his portion With hypocrites, this is the least, That after condemnation He shall both weepe and gnash for wo, His teeth that he applyed so. Wake therefore, and be warie men, For ye know not what houre or day Your master comes, least sleeping then You with the reprobates decay. And watch that with th' elected sort Receiu'd ye be, to your comfort. Christ receiued infants brought vnto him and blessed them. At that time some did children bring, That Christ his hands on them should lay: But his Disciples did the thing Dislike, and would haue said them nay. But Iesus said, forbid not these, For such my heau'nly father please. Assuredly to you I say, Gods kingdome who receiueth not As doth a child, there shall not stay, Of him no place may there be got. In armes Christ tooke the infants tho, And blessed them and let them go. Christ conferred with a rich young man, that would be iustified by the law. When Iesus was gone on the way, There came one after him apace: Which kneeling downe, to him did say, Good master shew me so much grace, That I may know, how I may haue Eternall life good Lord I craue. Then Iesus answerd him againe, Why doest thou call me good, said he? There is none good, this thing is plaine, Saue God alone, I tell it thee: Eternall life thou mayst not see, If broken these commaund'ments be. Thou shalt not kill, by word or deed, Nor yet commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale, for all thy need: False witnesse, is plaine trecherie. Thy parents honour, not for pelfe: Thy neighbour loue thou, as thy selfe. I haue, said he, obserued all That thou commandest from my youth: What lacke I yet, before I shall Haue life, I pray thee tell me truth? Sell all, if thou wilt perfect be, And giue the poore that want by thee. This made the yong man very sad, Who then with sorrow went away: The great possessions that he had, His feruent zeale did soone allay. The rich t'enioy eternall blisse, Said Iesus, sure a hard thing is. Whereat amazed as they were, And thought that few could saued be: Christ said to them, do you not feare, But marke and listen vnto me, What men impossible do take, God possible the same can make. Life euerlasting, promised to all them that follow Christ. Then Peter said, we follow thee Forsaking all: what shall we haue? When I in throne of maiestie Shall sit: though you do nothing craue, Vpon twelue thrones you shall sit by, And iudge all Israell certainly. For who so shall his house forsake, His parents, or what other friend For my name: and doth well it take, Or wife, or wealth, what God doth lend, The same an hundreth fold shall he Enioy, and life eternall see. And Christ pronounced in this place, That many first should be the last: And that the last obtaining grace, Should be the first: the first outcast; And that this sentence is certaine, By parable Christ made it plaine. The parable of the labourers sent to the vineyard. The kingdome sure of heau'n, is so, Much like to a houshoulder heare, That to hire labourers would go, Assoone as day light did appeare: With whom for pence he did agree, All day to worke, this was their fee. About the third houre of the day, When he came to the market place, The idle thence he sent away Into his farme, to worke apace. Likewise the sixt and ninth houre he With other moe did so agree. Againe th' eleu'nth houre there he found, Some other idle standing by: Go hence he said to my farme ground, Why stand vee thus so idlely? No man hath hired vs, you see. Go to my Vineyard, then said he. When eeuen came, the maister said Vnto his steward, call them soone: For I would haue the workemen paid, That all this day my worke haue done; Begin and pay the last of all, As he is seru'd, the other shall. A pennie then each of them had, From last, to first, as he did go: Which made the first men very sad, They thought their pay should not be so. Go to said he, this is your hire, You may no more of me require. This parable may teach vs all, (As Peter) true humilitie, Not to presume on Christ to call, As meriting felicitie: Least we of first the last may be, And last be first in each degree. The crueltie of Pylate towards certaine Galileans, and of the Towre of Siloam. When Christ had ended thus the same, Which neuer shunned any paine, Though in Iudea was a fame, That he should of the Iewes be slaine, He went about his fathers will, Therefore the Iewes sought him to kill. Then some told him how cruelly, Those Galileans vsed were, Whom Pylate caused for to die, Without respect he slew them there, And mingled with their sacrifice Their bloud; which was a strange deuice. Then Iesus said, suppose ye these Were greater sinners then the rest? I tell you nay, your sinnes doubtlesse, May cause that you shall so be drest. So of the eighteene whom the towre Of Siloam slue, all in an houre. The parable of the barren Figge tree. This parable Christ did declare; A certaine man a Figge tree had, Which for three yeares he still found bare, When fruite would make the owner glad. Come Gardiner, cut downe said he, Why are we combred with this tree? The Gardiner then said againe, Lord let it stand this yeare also, Till I once more haue taken paine, To dig it round, and dung it to; If then no fruite this tree do beare, It shall no longer tarrie there. Christ healed a woman that had had a spirit of infirmitie xviiij. yeares, and was so bowed together, that she could not lift vp her selfe. As Christ taught on a Sabboth day, A woman whose infirmity Had bow'd her long, she could no way, Lift vp her selfe, then certainly. Christ said be loosd of thy disease, Laying on his hand, she straight found ease. The ruler of the Synagogue, Was fill'd with indignation, As if his conscience had a clogge, Or of a proud presumption; Six dayes ye may well healed be, And rest the Sabboth day, said he. Then said the Lord, thou hypocrite, Do ye not on the Sabboth day, Your oxe and asse without respite, Loose from the stall and driue away? And should not she whom Sathan bound, The Sabboth day go safe and sound? When Christ said this, his enemy Was sore ashamed, and the rest Reioycing, did God glorifie, Which by their words was well exprest: For they gaue God the onely prayse, That wrought such works in those their dayes. The parable of the mustard seede, and of the leauen. What is the kingdome of God like? Or whereto shall I it compare? (Christ saw that some did not mislike His deeds, and doctrine, which were rare) It is like to a mustard seed, That man doth sow, to serue his need. This seed of seeds though sure the least, Yet sowne, it waxeth to a tree, Wherein the litle birds may neast, As oftentimes we do them see. Or leauen in three peckes of flowre, Till all be leauend and made sowre. This mustard seed, that is so small, And therefore subiect to disdaine: And eke the leauen there withall, Doth signifie Christs Gospell plaine; Gods word though weake it seeme to be, Works great effects in some we see. The parable of the strait and broad way. And as through eu'ry towne he went, And taught going to Hierusalem: That few be saued is it ment, Said they? thus answerd Christ to them; The strait gate striue to enter to, Though many faile that so would do. The goodman of the house when he Is risen vp and shuts the gate, Your might or merite litle be, To cry Lord open, is to late. Depart saith he, hence speedily, You workers of iniquitie. We eaten haue, say you againe, And dronke, oh Lord, so oft with thee, And thou hast taught vs, but in vaine. Depart (saith he) away from me. Your sinnes are onely cause of this, That you shall loose eternally blisse. There ye then weeping all shall be, And gnashing of your teeth full sore, When Abraham in heau'n ye see, And ye shut out, as is before. The Patriarks, and the Prophets, rest In heau'n aboue, for they are blest. And many shall come from the East, And from the North, and South also: And many likewise from the West, The heau'nly kingdome come vnto: And then the first, the last shall be, And so the last, first you shall see. Christ called Herod a foxe, and cryed against Hierusalem. The Pharisies to Christ did say, King Herod doubtlesse will thee kill: Depart therefore and get away, Ere he do worke on thee his will. Thus would they seeme his friends to be, That sought his death aswell as he. Go tell the foxe, said Christ, from me, Behold, I cast out deu'ls to day, And eke to morow I make free And heale the sicke that do me pray: The third day I do make an end, I care not what the foxe intend. To morow as to day I must, And yet the third day walke also: It cannot be, you may giue trust To this that now declare I do, Saue at Ierusalem alone, Shall of the Prophets perish none. Hierusalem that oft doest kill, And stone those that are sent to thee, Thy childrens good I wished still, Yet canst not thou thy saftie see: But from thee when I shall be reft, Thy house then desolate is left. Christ healed one of the dropsie on the Sabboth day. Againe as Iesus would eate meate With one of the chiefe Pharisies, They friendly seeme him to intreate, To colour out some braue deuise: Their snares and traps for him they lay, And watch him on the Sabboth day. Behold, a certaine man was there, Infected with a dropsie sore: Some Lawyers there at that time were, Which watched him so much the more. Christ asked if it lawfull be, The man on that day to make free. They held their peace: for to reproue His words and deeds they did intend: The matter he no more did moue, But healed him, and made an end. Who doth said Christ his oxe espy In pit, this day, and lets him lye? Christ forbad men to presse for the highest roomes at feasts, taught men lowlinesse, and to vse liberalitie vnto the poore. A parable Christ Iesus spake When he the guests had marked well, How each the highest roome would take. See that (saith Christ) you do not mell With chiefest roomes, when you are bid, Least thence your betters do you rid. When thou art bidden to a feast, Go and sit lowest in the place: Then saith the master, come my guest, Sit higher vp; this giueth grace: For who so him exalteth hye, Shall be brought low reprochfully. When thou doest make a feast, command To call the poore, the maim'd, the lame, And blind, to such stretch forth thy hand, This will gaine thee deserued fame: And thou thy recompence, this trust, Shalt haue in heau'n, among the iust. And one of them that then there sate, Said he is blest that eateth bread In heau'n, and happy are their state, That their liues there might alwayes lead. In heau'n as (this man doth confesse) Sure resteth all true happinesse. Christ declared how a certaine man made a great supper, and bade many: of the excuses of certaine guestes, and their vnworthinesse. Christ Iesus said, a certaine man Made a great supper or a feast. Come ye as soone now as ye can, His seruants said vnto each guest: For all things are now readie made, To welcome whom our maister bade. But they began to make excuse: The first said, I haue bought a farme, I must go see it, as they vse, Thou maist excuse me without harme. The next, of Oxen bought yokes fiue, And must go proue how they do thriue. The third had married then a wife, Sure he might well excused be: For he was bound to lead his life With her, and liue no longer free. You know what wilfull men deserue, All their excuses may not serue. The seruants told their maister, these Whom thou hast bid, come not at all: Which did him verie much displease, And said, another sort goe call; Go bid the poore, the lame, the blinde, And such as in the streetes ye finde. The seruants said, Lord, it is done, Yet there are roomes vnfurnished. In the high waies seeke some out soone, That my house be replenished: For those men that were bid before, Shall neuer tast my supper more. Then to the multitude that went With him, Christ turned backe, and sayd; If any man with good intent, Come after me, now vnaffrayd, He must hate father and each friend, To beare my crosse vnto the end. Who meanes to build a stately towre, And doth not cast the cost before, He may repent him in that houre, When he can make thereof no more: Or when he heares one mocking say, This man did worke well for a day. What king also will purpose warre, Ere he know what his strength may proue: And will not rather send so farre, And see if he some peace may moue? He my Disciple that will be, Forsaking all, must follow me. And sure what salt this earth doth yeeld, If in the same no sauour be, It doth no good in house or field, Men cast it out at doores we see. In salt of man, this doth appeare, He that hath eares to heare, may heare. The parable of the lost sheepe and the groat. Then to Christ Iesus did resort, Both Publicans and sinners to: Such in his doctrine found comfort, As still the penitent may do. The Scribes and Pharisies disdain'd, That Christ with sinners so remain'd. Then Iesus said, I came to saue That which my dearest bloud must cost: How thinke ye if a rich man haue An hundred sheepe, if one be lost, Will he not leaue the rest behind, And seeke that one till that he find? Or else, what woman doth not so, If she ten siluer peeces had, And loose but one, will she not go Search till she finde, and found is glad? The Angels ioy as these in heart, When that one sinner doth conuert. The historie of the prodigall sonne. Moreouer, marke ye this, said he, Two sonnes a certaine rich man had, Who cared much that they might be A cause to make his last age glad. The younger led by lust, would go To trauell farre, his father fro. Wherefore he to his father sayd, Giue me that is my portion: My suite, let it not be denayd, But make a iust diuision. His substance he diuided tho, And gaue him his, and let him go. This younger sonne did gather all His father gaue, and went away, From place to place as did befall, In countreys strange, this sonne did stray: Till riot wasted all his wealth, As whordome had impaird his health. When he had spent all wilfully, There rose a dearth throughout the land, And he there pincht with penurie, Was forc'd to go then out of hand To serue, nor durst the man repine, To keepe and feede his masters swine. Where oft for want of better food, Huskes with the swine this youth did eate, And then the same thought very good, For no man gaue him better meate: And sometimes in his misery, He wanted huskes assuredly. Then came he to himselfe, and sayd, How many hired seruants be, That finde my fathers house an ayde, And there haue meate inough said he, While I do liue thus lothsomely, And neare for hunger daily dye? I will vnto my father go, And say to him, I sinned haue Against both heau'n and thee also, Forgiue me father now I craue, And me receiue yet I thee pray, No sonne but seruant from this day. So he vnto his father went, Who did his sonne from farre espy, And ran to him incontinent, Much pitying his misery. And then vpon his necke he fell, And kist him, that he lou'd so well. The sonne then to his father there, Sayd I haue sinned against thee, And am not worthie to be here, Or call'd thy sonne that I should be: For heau'n and earth can witnesse this, That I haue runne my race amisse. The father said his seruants to, Bring forth my best robe vnto me, To put on him, this ring also, And shoes on his feete, I will see: The fat calfe kill, and make vs meate, That this my sonne, and we, may eate. For this my sonne of late was dead, And now he is aliue againe: The lost, I found, so well I sped, He shall henceforth with me remaine. This they performed speedily, And past the time most merily. Abroad the elder brother was, And comming home, he heard a noyse, Yet knew not who was in the place, Nor why his father did reioyce: He onely heard the mynstrelsie, With dauncing, and much melodie. He call'd, and bad a seruant come, And tell him what all those things ment: Thy brother is said he come home, And was receiu'd incontinent: Thy father spareth for no cost, To welcome him that late was lost. All angrie when he heard the same, He would not in vnto them go: Therefore to him his father came, Requesting him not to do so. Now he vnto his sonne doth stand (That should command) with cap in hand. The sonne his father answered, I haue vnto thee seruice donne, Yet hast thou not considered, How though I were thy eldest sonne, And many yeares now night and day, I still at thy command did stay; Yet all this time I neuer had, A kid of thee that I might spend, When I was willing to be glad, And welcome any honest friend: Yet thou the fat calfe killed hast, For him that worse thy goods did wast. Sonne vnto him againe, said he, All that I haue is thine in deed: Thou euer didst abide with me, And shalt therefore the better speed; Yet should we ioy and mery be, The dead aliue, and lost to see. The parable of the vniust Steward. And Christ to his Disciples then, Said that a certaine rich man had A Steward, charged by some men, That he did vse his office bad: For he (said they) doth day by day, Consume and wast thy wealth away. He called him, and said withall, How do I heare this ill of thee? For thine accounts I needs must call, Thou mayst no longer Steward be. The Steward then began to muse, How he might best the matter vse. What shall I do? my master will Mine office take from me away: I cannot digge nor delue but ill, And begge for shame I neuer may; Wherefore I must deuise, sayd he, That I of some receiued be. His masters debters he did call, And askt the first, what owest thou? Declare at once the summe of all, For I must loose mine office now. Of oyle an hundreth measures he Confest, at least, his debts to be. The Steward said to him againe, Vpon thy bill downe fiftie lay: The next indebted did remaine, And hundreth measures, he did say, Of wheate, to whom the Steward sayd, Write fourescore downe, be not affrayd. The Stewards wisdome Christ did prayse, Though he vniustly dealt in deed: For when he knew none other wayes, He this deuisd, to helpe his need. The worldlings in their kind, said he, Are wiser then the godly be. Make you so friends, Christ to them sayd, With riches of iniquity: That when ye want, they may giue ayde, And then receiue you readily. The iust or vniust in the small, Will proue the very same in all. If then ye haue not faithfull bene In wicked riches, who will trust, That you (whose triall men haue seene) In treasures true may be found iust? If false to other men ye were, Who shall giue you that yours is there? Two masters well no man can serue, For truly he the one will hate, And for the other loue reserue, This of mans life is right the state: God and your riches disagree, They may not both then serued be. All these things heard the Pharisies, Whose greedinesse was very great: They mocked Christ, for phantasies They do account his words as yet. Before men ye, you iustifie, Though fraught with fowle hypocrisie. Gods kingdome suffreth violence, Since Iohns time to this very day: The Gentiles with all diligence, Without the law, now call'd obay. The law and Prophets haue their end, And he is come whom you attend. I came not sure for to destroy The law, or Prophets, but fulfill: I take in nothing so much ioy, As to obey my fathers will, Till heau'n and earth do all decay, The law shall not be done away. The historie of the rich glutton and of poore Lazarus. Christ said, a certaine rich man he, Was cloth'd in purple and fine white: His fare most daintie vsd to be, For he therein did take delite. As costly was the mans aray, So far'd he sumptuous eu'ry day. There was a certaine begger that Was named Lazarus also, Which was layd at the rich mans gate, All full of grieuous sores and wo: This man therewith had more annoy, Then Diues had in heart of ioy. And he desired for to haue, (Wherewith his body for to feed) The broken meate, yet no man gaue One crumbe for to relieue his need: The dogges yet came and lickt each sore, These then their master, easd him more. It came to passe the begger he, Dying, was carried thence away, In Abrahms bosome for to be, The Angels there this man did lay: Those messengers God sent to fetch To heau'n to him, that silly wretch. The rich man also shortly dyed, His wealth could not deaths dart withdraw, But needs he must be buried, Each man must yeeld to natures law: And as the begger was on hye, So Diues deepe in hell did lye. From whence as he in torments lay, And looked vp, he might espy, Aboue from him so farre away, Where Lazarus in heau'n did ly (With Abraham:) so was he blest, For there Gods chosen all shall rest. Then cried Diues loud, and sayd, Oh father Abrah'm pitie me, Let not thy mercie be delayd, My cruell torments thou doest see: The firie flame doth frie me so, That here I wallow full of wo. Send Lazarus, that once he may His finger in the water dip, This feruent heate for to allay, If it were but the verie tip. One drop to coole my tongue withall, That so his finger would let fall. But Abraham said thus againe; The pleasures (sonne) thou didst receiue, Remember now, and this mans paine: Thy wealth at will did thee deceiue, Therefore art thou (as doth appeare) In paine, and he in pleasure here. Comforted now is Lazarus, And thou in hell tormented art: There is set likewise betweene vs A mightie gulfe, no litle start, So that none hence go to you may, Nor come from thence to vs away. Here Christ did speake of heau'n and hell, No Purgatorie then was found: Or else Christ Iesus could not well, As schoole-men can, all things expound. But wo to them that thinke them wise, And do Christs doctrine so despise. Him, Diues said, I pray thee send, (Oh father) to my fathers house: To warne my brethren to amend, And force no wealth so friuolous. Vaine trust therein hath wrought my fall, And will do theirs, I feare me all. Send him therefore (father) I pray, For fiue of them I left behind: Which warned may amend their way, And become of a better mind; Oh father shew them so much grace, Least they should come into this place. Then Abraham said thus againe, They Moses and the Prophets haue: If they do not heare them, in vaine, They shall obtaine what thou doest craue. They warne all men to seeke for grace, While they haue time, to shunne that place. Nay father Abraham, said he, But if one from the dead do come To them, repentant they will be, And be affrayd then of this dome: They will not sinning wilfully, Be subiect to such misery. Then Abraham said to him, sonne, If that those men they will not heare, But do as thou before hast donne, No more will they to this giue eare: For truth in Gods word seeke they must, And not on dead men vainly trust. Here heau'n is the appointed place, Where Gods elect for aye shall rest: In hell we see such as want grace, All torments are for them addrest. Gods word not dead men must vs guide, Vnlesse we meane to wander wide. As for all Dunses drowsie dreames, Or Monkish toyes to mocke an ape, Or franticke Friers, for all their theames, They now want nayles new pits to scrape: Their Purgatories had a fall, There is not one now left of all. Offences are to be auoyded, and our brothers trespasses forgiuen. Though that offences needs must be, Yet sure offenders do want grace: Offend not these whose Angels see And do behold my fathers face; He that doth so, were better sure, In surging seas death to endure. And if thy brother thee offend, Seeke thou to winne him priuatly: Or if he heare not thee, and mend, Take two or three in company; But if he heare not then the same, Before the Church let him haue blame. But if he do repent, he sayd, As oft as he doth thee offend, And seemeth still to be affrayd, And seekes all meanes for to amend, Not seu'n times, but as oft (said he) As he repents, let him go free. And the Apostles all said then, O Lord increase our faith we pray. If ye had faith as much (ô men) As is a mustard seed, I say, You might command this mulb'rie tree, So growing in the sea to be. Which of you if his seruant were At plough, or did his cattell feede, When he came home, would say, sit here? And so serue him at boord with speed. And would not rather bid him dresse (That he him selfe might eate) a messe? Or who doth thanke his seruant then, When he perfourmeth readily What he commandeth, that his men Should see accomplisht faithfully? I trow the seruant may be glad, That he did what his maister bad. So likewise ye, when ye haue done What you are bid, although with care: Say, that small profit may be wonne By such slacke seruants as ye are. We haue done, you may say also, What was our dutie, and no mo. Christ healed ten leapers. As to Ierusalem he went, And passed thorough Galilie, Ten leapers did them selues present To Iesus Christ immediatly, Which stood farre off, and cried thus, Haue mercie maister now on vs. And when he saw them, then sayd he, Vnto the Priests go straight way now, That they may iudge you cleane to be, And haue what law doth them allow. And as they went they cleansed were, While Christ remained euen there. Then one of them when he did see, That he was healed verie well: Returning backe, with loud voyce he Gaue praise to God for what befell. He falling downe vpon his face, Gaue thanks to Christ, that shewd him grace. The same was a Samaritan, Which cleansed came so backe againe: Of ten, returned but this man, Though all were eased of their paine. This in Samaria verily By Christ was done, or Galilie. Are not ten cleansed? Iesus sayd, The other nine where be they gone? Arise therefore, go vnaffrayd, Thy faith sau'd thee that cam'st alone. Of all the ten this stranger came To giue God praise, that wrought the same. The Pharisies demanded of Christ, when the kingdome of God should come, and his answer. Then of the Pharisies when some Demanded Christ when it would be, That the kingdome of God would come To them againe thus answerd he; With obseruation verily It comes not, though with maiestie. Men shall not say, lo here, lo there, Behold the same among you is: His kingdome is spread eu'ry where, In faithfull hearts abideth this. In truth and righteousnesse I say, Find out Gods kingdome well ye may. To his Disciples then said he, The dayes will come you shall desire (As now ye are) with me to be, And shall not haue what ye require. The sonne of man must suffer wo: And for a time depart you fro. If any then to you do say, Lo here is Christ, or Christ is there, Beleeue it not, for at that day, False Christs and Prophets shall appeare, And shall shew signes and wonders such, As will deceiue men very much. For as the lightning from the East Doth come, and that most suddainly, And shineth forth into the West, So shall it be most certainly: The sonne of man shall come, I say, In like sort at the iudgement day. And as it was before the flood, They did both eate and drinke also, And maried wiues, as they thought good, Till Noah the arke had entred tho: Where he and his from flood were free, Though all men else were drownd, said he. In Lots dayes likewise it befell, They ate, they dranke, they bought, they sold, They built, and thought that all was well, Nor would heare Lot, for all he told, Till fire and brimstone from aboue, Destroyed all that there did moue. So shall it in the latter day, When I shall then reuealed be: Let him that on the house doth stay, Not fetch his stuffe below, said he: Nor from the field, but haue in mind, Lots wife that looked so behind. Who so his soule doth seeke to saue, If not through me, shall loose the same: And life he likewise then shall haue, When life he looseth for my name: For he shall liue eternally, That dyeth so here willingly. Two in one bed, or field shall then, Whereof but one receiu'd shall be, The other of those very men, To be refused sure is he. Two women grinding then at mill, The good receiu'd, but not the ill. Where Lord? where the carcasse doth rest, The eagles will resort thereto: If that it be by East or West, Such fowle, vnto their pray will go. Gods chosen shall resort that day To Christ, as these vnto their pray. The parable of the vnrighteous Iudge and the widow, teaching men to pray continually. By parable Christ spake that day To his Disciples, to this end, That they ought alwayes for to pray, And not to faint while they attend: For they shall surely mercie haue, That instantly for mercie craue. There was a Iudge which had no feare, Nor reuerence of God or men: A widow woman dwelling there, Did moue this Iudge (not now and then) But dayly crying mightely, Auenge me of mine enemie. Though for a time he would not heare Her sute; thus the poore widow sped, At last said he, though without feare Of God or man my life I lead, Her instancie doth vexe me so, Ile do her right, and let her go. If this vnrighteous Iudge thus do, For his elect will not God care, That day and night cry him vnto? Though for a time their foes he spare, He will reuenge ech iniurie That they receiue assuredly. The Parable of the Pharisie and the Publicane, that went into the Temple to pray. A parable he spake againe, To some infected with selfe trust: For they did other men disdaine, And did account them selues for iust. Into the Temple for to pray, Two men went vp, both in one day. The one of them a Pharisie, The other was a Publican: The first full of hypocrisie, The other was a simple man. Their prayers sheweth what they were, Of whom Christ maketh mention here. The first stood vp and prayed so, Oh God this day I do thanke thee: This I as other neuer do, Extort or robbe as some, said he: I am not an adulterer, Nor as this man is, a sinner. Twise in the weeke also I fast, I giue tith of all I possesse. The Publican poore man at last, Began his sinnes for to confesse: This man in great humilitie, Acknowledged his miserie. He stood farre of, and did not there, Lift vp his eyes to looke on hye: The poore man was in such a feare, For to offend Gods maiesty; Be mercifull (oh God) said he, Most wretched sinner vnto me. This man, said Christ, went thence away, More iust then did the Pharisie: For eu'ry one that doth delay To knowledge his infirmitie, Shall be brought low: the humble he, Likewise exalted sure shall be. The parable of the Talents. The kingdome of heau'n much like is Vnto a king that went from home, To a strange countrey farre from his, But made his seruants first to come, To whom he did deliuer tho, His goods ere he from home would go. To one man gaue he Talents fiue, And to another onely two: The third had one, therewith to thriue, Each one had some-thing for to do, As they were able: then straight-way, He went from home that very day. Then he that the fiue Talents had, Went and did occupie the same: And gainde, to make his master glad, Fiue Talents more before he came. He that likewise receiued two, Did therewith gaine as many mo. But he that had receiued one, Within the earth did digge the same, And hid the money with a stone, To keepe vntill his master came. Thus eu'ry one did occupie Their masters Talents diuersly. And after a long season came The master of those seruants home, And reckned with them for the same, One after other as they come. To giue accounts from first to last, They all were call'd, till all was past. Then came he that fiue Talents had, And brought with him fiue Talents mo, And sayd, oh master heare (be glad) Thy money is, and gaynes also: For I haue gayned as much more. As I receiu'd of thee before. To him his master sayd againe, Thou good and faithfull seruant hast Well done, therewith to take such paine, Thou shalt receiue reward at last. Thy masters ioy enter and take, Of much I will thee ruler make. He came also that did receiue Two Talents, and thus could he say: Oh master, here thou mayst perceiue My gaynes, since thou went'st hence away; Here is thy money that I had, And as much more, that I haue made. His master vnto him then sayd, Good seruant sure it is well donne, The time, I see was not delayd, Thou couldst not else so much haue wonne: Thy faithfulnesse in this was such, I will thee ruler make of much. Then he which had receiued one, Came to his master, and did say; When thou away from hence wast gone, I hid thy money without nay, Because I fear'd thy crueltie, Receiue thine owne contentedly. His master answered and sayd, Thou ill and slouthfull seruant, why (If thou of me were so affrayd, And knew'st so well my crueltie) Didst not thou finde some meane or way, To get me gaynes against this day? The Talent take from him therefore, And giue it him that now hath ten: For who so hath, he shall haue more, And he shall haue abundance then. From him that hath not, shall a way Be taken what he hath, I say. That seruant voyde of profit, ye To vtter darknesse therefore cast, There weepe and gnash his teeth shall he: Thus shall his slouth be payd at last. See then your talent fructifie, Least you loose it eternally. Of the labourers hired into the vineyard. The kingdome sure of heau'n is so, Like vnto a housholder here, That to hire labourers would go, Assoone as day-light did appeare. With them for pence he did agree, All day to worke, this was their fee. About the third houre of the day, When he came to the market place, The idle thence he sent away, Into his farme to worke apace. Likewise the sixt and ninth houre he, With other mo did then agree. Againe th' eleu'nth houre there he found Some other idle standing by: Go ye (said he) to my farme ground, Why stand ye thus so idlely? No man hath hired vs you see. Go to my vineyard, then said he. When euen came the master sayd, Vnto his Steward, call them soone, That I may see the worke-men payd, Which all this day my worke haue donne. Begin and pay the last of all: As he is seru'd the other shall. A penie each of them then had, From last to first as he did go: Which made the first men very sad, They thought their pay should not be so. Go to, said he, this is your hire, You may no more of me require. Christ as he went to Ierusalem did admonish his Disciples of his passion. As to Ierusalem he went, Christ Iesus told them certainly, The Priests and Scribes with full intent, Do purpose me to crucifie: Yet when the Gentiles haue me slaine, The third day I will rise againe. Iohn and Iames the sonnes of Zebede contended for primacie, and were taught humilitie and patience, and to auoyde ambition. The wife of Zebedeus came To Christ, and both her sonnes also, And her request she thus did frame, Graunt ere thou to thy kingdome go, That these my sonnes there sitting be, Each one, vpon each hand of thee. Ye wot not what ye aske, said he, Can ye drinke of my cup in deed? Or be Baptiz'd as I shall be? Yea that we can, if we may speed. Yet I can not graunt your request, That in my father sure doth rest. But when the other ten heard this, They at the brethren did disdaine. Then Iesus sayd ye thinke amisse, Among the Gentiles Lords do raigne: They that are great of them, are prest, Authorized, to rule the rest. It shall not so among you be, He that would greatest seeme of all, Or chiefest in authoritie, Shall serue the rest, as at a call. As to be serued came not I, But serue, and saue men certainly. Christ gaue blind Bartimeus and two other blind men their sight as he passed from Iordan through Iericho toward Ierusalem. The 14. of March. The fourteenth day as Iesus went From Iordan towards Bethanie, In Iericho, there did present, A worke none else could remedie: Blind Bartimeus and two men As blind as he, were crying then; O sonne of Dauid make vs see, We are poore men both bare and blind, Let our estate (oh Lord) moue thee, That we may of thy mercy find. Their blindnesse he did helpe straight-wayes, And they him follow'd giuing prayse. The calling of Zacheus a rich man, and by office the chiefe receiuer of tribute. As Iesus went through Iericho, Zacheus sought him for to see: His stature did not serue him so, Among the throng it would not be. He ran and clymed vp therefore, A figge tree in the way before. This was the shift that rich man had, To see Christ as he came that way: When Christ came by, to make him glad, He looking vp, to him did say; Zache come downe without delay, At thy house Ile abide this day. Then he came downe full hastily, Assoone as Iesus did command: And him receiued ioyfully; But some of them that there did stand, Did murmure that he then would go, To lodge there with a sinner so. To Christ Zacheus as he stood, Said (Lord) I giue halfe that I haue Vnto the poore, to do them good, And no man shall haue need to craue; What I by fraude or force did take, Fourefold Ile giue him for thy sake. Then Iesus sayd, saluation Is come into this house, ye see: Sith of the generation Of Abraham, by faith is he. The sonne of man doth seeke and saue, That which was lost, as here I haue. Iesus though he stayd a while (after he had heard that Lazarus was sicke) working in the regions round about sundry miracles, and preaching the Gospell: at last he returned to Bethanie, where he raised Lazarus from death to life againe. Now to returne to Lazarus, Which was already dead in deed: To his Disciples Christ said thus, Come let vs go from hence with speed: To Iurie we without all stay, Must passe apace the ready way. O master, then said they againe, The Iewes sought lately thee to stone, And wilt thou not then here remaine, And so prouide to saue for one? He stumbleth not that walkes by day, But in the night (said Christ) he may. These things Christ Iesus to them spake, And then said, Lazarus doth sleepe, But I go him for to awake. What Christ then ment, they tooke no keepe, But said, Lord, if he sleepe, then he Both safe and sound will shortly be. Then Iesus said to them againe, Our friend is dead, and I reioyce I was not there: Christ then was plaine, To strengthen such as he made choice. Then Thomas said, come, let vs go, That we with him may dye also. The fifteenth day Christ Iesus spent, In iourneying along the way: He then bewrayed what he meant, In Bethanie the sixteenth day. For Iesus then in hand did take, His sleeping friend, againe to wake. Christ found he had lyen in the graue, Foure dayes already ere he came: The women they this comfort haue, The Iewes that heard his death by fame, (Because Ierusalem was nye) Came vnto them to Bethanie. When Martha heard that Christ was there, She went to meete him by the way, And said, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, Thy friend had not bene dead this day: Yet what thou doest desire or craue Of God, I know thou mayst it haue. Thy brother then said Christ shall rise. I know said Martha the last day. Life without me is in no wise, Nor resurrection I say. The man in me that doth beleeue, Though he were dead, yet shall he liue. Who liues and doth beleeue in me, Shall neuer dye: beleeu'st thou this? I do beleeue, thou Lord, art he, That Christ, the sonne of God iwis, Which should come to the world, and so When she had said, home she did go. Then called she forth secretly, Her sister, and to her she said: The master is come hard here by, Where he and his for thee haue stayd. When she heard this, she quickly rose, And to the Lord forthwith she goes. Iesus came not yet to the towne, Where Martha met him there he was: When Mary went so hastie downe, The Iewes that were then there in place, Rose vp, and said, come follow now, She will go weepe for him we know. When Mary came our Sauiour to, She flat downe at his feete then fell: My brother (Lord) she sayd also, Had not bene dead, I know it well, If thou hadst here bene him to see, For God had him restor'd to thee. When Iesus therefore saw her weepe, And all the Iewes that came with her: He groned in the spirite deepe, So moued his affections were. Where haue ye layd him then sayd he? They sayd vnto him (Lord) come see. And Iesus wept: the Iewes then sayd, Behold, how he did loue the man: His death could Christ not haue delayd, That blind mens eyes so open can? Then he againe did deepely grone, And from the graue, said take the stone. Then Martha sayd, he stinketh now, For he is dead foure dayes ago. Then Iesus sayd, I did thee show, If thou beleeue what I would do; Gods glorie, this I sayd to thee, If thou beleeue, thou shouldest see. When they, the stone remoued had, Then Iesus did lift vp his eyes, And sayd (oh father) I am glad, My prayers thou doest not despise; That these (as thou still hearest me) May know that I am sent of thee. Then Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, Come Lazarus, out of the graue. Then he came forth, and they reioyce, Their dead againe so whole to haue. Christ bad them loose away each band, For he was bound face, foote, and hand. Then many of them did beleeue, When they had seene what he had donne: This act did others of them grieue, And to the Pharisies they runne; To whom they told what they had seene In Bethanie, where they had bene. The high Priests and the Pharisies, A counsell called out of hand: What shall we now (sayd they) deuise? Christs fame is spread throughout the land. Such wondrous works now worketh he, His miracles, who doth not see? All men in him will sure beleeue, If we do let him thus alone: The Romans will come vs to grieue, (Supplanting all our nation) They will our rulers take away, Therefore deuise we may him slay. Then he that Cayphas had to name, And was the high Priest that same yeare, Perceiue ye not (sayd he) the same? And doth it not to you appeare, That for the people one must dye, Least they should perish vtterly? This God did make him Prophesie: Against himselfe he witnesse beares, Though for all people Christ should dye, (Who, guiltlesse bloud to spill but feares?) Gods children and his scattred sheepe, Christ Iesus had a care to keepe. From that day, they consulted how They might him take, and cause to dye: Whereas the Iewes of him might know, Christ walked no more openly. To Ephraim he went away, Where he and his Disciples lay. The passeouer was then at hand, And to Ierusalem there went Full many out of all that land, Before the feast: some with intent Themselues as then to purifie, Which feast the Iewes kept orderly. The Iewes for Iesus sought about: All in the temple where they where, That he came not did make them doubt, For they had sought him eu'ry where. They chargd'd who knew where he would lye, To tell, or take him craftily. Six dayes before the feast, no more, Our Sauiour came to Bethanie: Where he would not be seene before, His enemies it was too nye. Now the appointed time was come, And Christ obayd his fathers dome. Though he but lately fled away, He then returned with good will. His fathers minde he would obay, And so all Prophesies fulfill. He came therefore to Bethanie, Prepared for mankind to dye. Christ being come backe to Bethanie from Ephraim, supped with Lazarus, and was annoynted by Mary, whereat Iudas was offended especiallie. Christ fearing neither watch nor ward, Did offer all occasion Vnto the Iewes, without regard, To hasten on his passion: Wherefore he supt in Bethanie, His aduersaries euen by. With Lazarus Christ supped there, And Martha serued then at boord, Where many did with ioy and feare, Attend vnto Christ Iesus word: As Iohn doth witnesse Mary then, Annoynted Christ before those men. Of oyntment Mary tooke a pound, Of Spiknard very costly sure, As any oyntment might be found, For it was perfect, sweet and pure, This all she spent on Iesus there, His head and feete as may appeare. His feete she wiped with her hayre, The house with odour it was sweete: The sauour so perfum'd the ayre, That came from Iesus head and feete. Yet Iudas did repine at this, For of his purpose he did misse. For he it was that did receiue, What men at any time did giue: This Christ did very well perceiue, How that her fact his mind did grieue: For straight with her a fault he fouud, And did her checke thus very round. This wast it needed not, sayd he, This oyntment for three hundred pence Might haue bene sold and giuen me, As part of the beneficence That vsed is vnto the poore, And such as go from doore to doore. He spake not as his mind then gaue, But moued with a vayne desire: For he did couet all to haue, This kindled in him flaming fire Of greedinesse, as did appeare, By such words as he vttred there. Then Iesus sayd, let her alone, She kept this for my burying day; The poore ye may well thinke vpon, They shall remaine with you alway: Ye shall not alwayes so haue me, But they alwayes with you shall be. The womans worke thus wrought on me Is good, and shall not be forgot; This Gospell where as it shall be Preached throughout the world, I wot: This act of hers shall be spoke sure, And her memoriall shall endure. Much people of the Iewes were there, Not all for Iesus sake onely, But for to try what they did heare, Of Lazarus assuredly. Of him they heard, as you haue read, How Iesus raisd him from the dead. The high Priests therefore tooke aduise, How they might Lazarus also Condemne with Christ in nay wise, Because they saw that many mo Did for his sake, in Christ beleeue, Which thing did very much them grieue. The next day following Christ went towards Ierusalem, riding most gloriously, the people crying Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid. When they were thence to Bethphage come, Which to Ierusalem is nye: From the mount Oliues he sent some, To the next village by and by; There hence to fetch an asse away, For him to ride vpon that day. If any one say ought, say ye, Thereof the Lord as now hath neede: And he will send the same to me, Therefore go hence, and come with speed. That Prophecies so long ago, Might be fulfilled, he did so. To tell it Sion, see ye go, Behold, thy king doth come to thee, Meeke sitting on an asse, and lo This happened then so to be: But his Disciples (as forgot) These things at first perceiued not. Yet the Disciples went away, Accomplishing their masters mind: They brought the asse without delay, Which Christ had told them how to find: And put their clothes the asse vpon, That Iesus then might ride thereon. A multitude that verie day, Of such as were come to the feast: When they heard Christ would ride that way, Met him, and they for ioy were prest To spread the branches they did beare, And some the clothes that they did weare. Moreouer they that deckt the way, And went Christ Iesus there before, And they that followed, each did say, And prayse his name for euermore; The king of Israell is come, Blessed be he for ay, sayd some. Hosanna Dauids sonne, to thee, Blessed art thou, some other say: All prayse and honour giuen be, To him that commeth now this way. Hosanna thou which art so hye In heau'n, full of all maiesty. When to Ierusalem they came, The Citie all was moued then: And fully prest this pompe to blame: Who is this, say they, to those men? Iesus, they say, that Prophet he, Of Nazareth in Galilie. Christ then againe purged the Temple, and cast out the buyers and sellers thence, and cured certaine blind and lame persons. So Christ went straight the Temple to, And purged then againe the same: He did (as he was wont to do) All their abuses greatly blame, Reprouing all those euill men, That made Gods house for theeues a den. Then to the Temple came the blind, The halt, and such as grieued were: Whom Christ did heale (such grace they find As seeke to him, let no man feare) Those men gaue God continuall prayse, That such a Prophet he would rayse. But when the chiefe Priests, Scribes, and such, Saw all the maruels that he wrought, It grieu'd them, and disdayning much, They vtter'd what in mind they thought: For they the children heard on hye (Hosanna Dauids sonne) to cry. Doest thou heare what these children say, Said they to Christ? he sayd I do: Haue you not read of this I pray, That written was so long ago? My babes and sucklings sure thou hast, Made the prayse perfect now at last. Christ conferred with certaine Grecians, or rather they desired to see Christ, and speake to him. Now there were certaine Greekes as then, That came to worship at the feast: Which were among those other men, As earnest as they saw the rest; These say to Philip we pray thee, To helpe that we may Iesus see. Philip told Andrew of the same, Againe they both to Iesus went, As messengers, in those mens name, And told him all, and who them sent. The houre is come, the sonne (sayd he) Of man must glorified be. I say vnto you verily, Except that the wheate corne do fall Into the ground, and therein dye, It bringeth forth no fruit at all: But if it dye, assuredly, It bringeth fruit abundantly. Another Sermon of the Crosse, wherein Christ couertly foretold of his death. He that doth loue his life, he shall Loose it, but who so hates it here, Shall keepe it to life eternall, Though his scarce truth, to some appeare: Learne ye your selues to hate therefore, That ye may liue for euermore. If any man wish to serue me, Let him come follow me, I say: For where I am, there shall he be, I will protect him night and day. They (in my seruice) that endure, My father will them honour sure. And Iesus herein declared Himselfe a perfect man to be: My soule (saith he) is now troubled, From this houre, father, saue thou me. But therefore to this houre I came, Yet father, glorifie thy name. Then came from heau'n a mightie voyce, Saying I haue, and will againe: (This may each mortall man reioyce, That God did not for him disdaine, To send his sonne to beare his blame) In whom he glorified his name. Then sayd the people that stood by, It was some thunder that they heard: But others sayd, nay verily, An Angell if ye do regard, Spake vnto him; thus diuerse men, Did diuersly iudge of it then. And Iesus answered, and sayd, This voyce came not because of me, But for your sakes, be not affrayd, Great things you shall both heare and see: For your sakes God will glorifie The sonne of man, assuredly. Of this world now the iudgement is, The Prince thereof cast out shall be: And if I were lift vp iwis, Ile from the earth, draw men to me. Now this sayd he to signifie, What death then shortly he should dye. We heard out of the law, sayd one, That Christ for euer should remaine: And how sayst thou, he must be gone, The sonne of man must needs be slayne, And lift vp high vpon a tree? Tell, who that sonne of man should be. Then Iesus sayd, a litle while Light is with you, walke in the same, Least that the darknesse you beguile, Who walkes therein may merite blame. While ye haue light beleeue therein, As louing it, and hating sinne. So left he them, and went againe, As he was wont, to Bethany: For there all night he did remaine, Among his chosen company. This night by night he vsed still, That so he might all things fulfill. Christ going the next day from Bethany to Hierusalem, cursed the figge tree. As Christ returned the next day, From thence Hierusalem vnto, He was an hungred by the way, And to a figge tree he did go, That grew hard by, thereon to find Some figges, as then to ease his mind. But when thereon he onely found Greene leaues, and not a figge at all, From top he curld it to the ground: Fruit hence-forth on thee neuer shall. Be seene againe, sayd Christ, and so, Away from thence they all did go. Like to an hypocrite, this tree Had leaues, but had no fruit to eate: Let hypocrites then warned be, By the same cursse, that Christ did threat: For with one word the Lord he may, Head, branch, and root, cause to decay. All his Disciples then did see What he had done, and heard likewise The curse Christ gaue vnto that tree, Yet litle thought in any wise, What would be fall, but thence they went, The Citie to as they were bent. Christ to the Temple went againe, And purg'd it, as he did before, Reprouing them that were so vayne, Abusing still then more and more That place, appointed men to pray, And not for marchandise to stay. The Scribes and high Priests hearing this, Sought how they might him then destroy, Though he had done nothing amisse, But gaue then cause of greatest ioy: They sought his life, that life doth giue To all men that in him beleeue. They feared him, for they did see, They could no way resist his will: And did perceiue most men to be Astonied at his doctrine still. When euen came Iesus did hye, And got him backe to Bethany. Christ returning the next day, the Disciples seeing the figge tree withered, tell him of it. The next day, as they passed by, Then the Disciples all did see The figge tree dryed, verily, And that vp from the roote to be. Then Peter sayd, master see this, The figge tree throughly with'red is. Then Iesus answering, did say, If he haue faith vnfainedly, Ye may this mountaine moue away And lay it in the sea to lye. See that your hearts be cleane and pure, And that your faith be firme and sure. Then what ye do desire, I say, By prayer shall be done in deed: Faithfull requests have wings alway, To flye vnto the Lord with speed. Forgiue when ye do pray also, That on your faults God thinke no mo. Then to Hierusalem they came, And to the temple went againe: Where walking then within the same, The high Priests fraught with foule disdaine, And all the Scribes and Elders were, To see Christ Iesus comming there. They askt by what authoritie, Christ did those things so lately there; Who is of so great dignitie, As may appoint thee ruler here? Our elders left vs long ago All power here, and to no mo. Then Iesus answered, and sayd, I will aske you one question, And answer me now vndelayd, Therein your iust opinion: And I, by what authoritie, Haue done these things, will testifie. Iohns Baptisme tell me certainly, Was it from heau'n or else of men? Now answer me vnfainedly, And you shall haue your answer then. Like doubtfulnesse there is in this, As in their former question is. They thought, if we confesse it came From heau'n, then will he surely say, Why did ye not beleeue for shame His doctrine, and his words obay? But if we say, of men, we feare The people, that are standing here. For Iohn accounted was in deed, A mightie Prophet of them there: When they perceiu'd how they should speed, To answer him they stood in feare; They answer'd then they knew not well, He answer'd them he would not tell. The Parable of the two sonnes. What thinke ye then sayd Christ againe? Two sonnes a certaine rich man had: Vnto the elder of the twaine The father came, and thus he bad: Go sonne, said he, and worke I say, Within my vineyard all this day. The sonne then answered, and sayd, I will not worke therein at all: But afterward as all affrayd To disobay his fathers call, His frowardnesse he did repent, And then into the vineyard went. Then came he to the second sonne, And sayd to him such words likewise: Thy will (sayd he) shall sure be done, Yet did his fathers hests despise. For this sonne neuer laboured In his worke as he promised. Now whether of the twaine say ye, Performed best the fathers will? The first or last tell this to me? The first sayd they, did it fulfill. The Publicans and harlots then, Shall go to heau'n before these men. For in the way of righteousnesse, Iohn came to you I say, said he: As did his doctrine well expresse, Yet ye beleu'd not him, I see; The Publicans and harlots they, Beleeuing did his words obey. Though ye his words and works did find, So well agreeing certainly: None to repentance gaue his mind, Among you all assuredly. His doctrine, that beleeuing ye, Might for your sinnes much grieued be. Another Parable of the vineyard, let out vnto the vnfaithfull husband-men. Another Parable heare ye, A certaine housholder did plant A vineyard, and round hedged he The same, that nothing it did want: And therein this man builded tho, A wine-presse, and a towre also. All this he let to husband-men, And traueld to a strange countrey: For thence he went to soiourne then, In hope his farmours would obey His will, and well performe also Their promise made, ere he did go. But when the time of fruit drue nye, And he had sent for to receiue The fruits of them his seruants by, As promise was when he tooke leaue. His seruants they did beate and kill, Litle regarding their Lords will. Againe he sent vnto them mo, Which seruants they did kill likewise: At last his sonne he causd to go, His sonne also they did despise. His onely sonne which he sent there, Of whom he hop'd they stood in feare. But when the husband-men did see The sonne: this is the heire, they sayd: Come let him likewise killed be, All shall be ours, be not affrayd; They slue the sonne himselfe at last, And him out of the vineyard cast. Now Iesus sayd, what thinke ye then? For these offences that your heare, What shall their Lord do to those men, Whose faults so manifest appeare? They slue his seruants one by one, And lastly slue his onely sonne. They sayd the Lord will sure destroy Most cruelly those wicked men, And others shall his farme enioy, To whom the Lord will let it then. That fruit in season will him yeeld, Of eu'ry sort within his field. Then Iesus sayd haue ye not read? The stone the builders did refuse, Is of the corner made the head? And so put there to chiefest vse. The Lord his doing it is this, And in our eyes a maruell is. Therefore I say to you againe, The kingdome of God sure shall be Taken from you, this thing is plaine, And giuen others francke and free, Which will the fruits thereof forth bring, And yeeld increase in eu'ry thing. And who so on this stone shall fall, Shall broken be, this you shall find: But on whom it shall fall withall, To powder him the stone will grind. The first he may be heald againe: This last shall labour but in vaine. When the chiefe Priests and Pharisie, These Parables of Christ did heare, They did perceiue then by and by, Of whom he spake as did appeare: For they on him sought hands to lay, Yet did for feare their purpose stay. The people that were standing by, A Prophet they tooke Christ to be: This feared them that did espy, Their readinesse to set him free. And eke his houre was not come then, Which was a let vnto those men. Another Parable of the King that made a mariage for his sonne, whose bidden guests refused to come (although they were called) to the wedding. Another Parable he spake As then, before the multitude, That vnexcused he might make The Iewes for their ingratitude, To whom the Lord so bounteously, Had offred so much clemency. Gods kingdome is like to a King, That made a mariage for his sonne: And when he had for his wedding Prepared what was to be donne, He sent his seruants then forth all, That they his bidden guests might call. The guests would not, though bid they were, Repaire with them vnto the feast: They sayd, they could not then be there, To their affaires they were addrest: And thus they did the King abuse, For eu'ry one made his excuse. The first had bought a farme he sayd, And he must needs the same go see: The second was no whit affrayd, Excused well he hop'd to be, Fiue yoke of oxen he did buy, And went to proue them hastily. The third had wed a wife as then, He could not come in any wise: Thus answered those wicked men, That did the heau'nly feast despise: Yet were they not so very bad, But there were some ten times as mad. For they intreated shamefully, The seruants that the King had sent: They killed them most cruelly, That so much good to them had ment; Though wicked were the first in deed, These did the other farre exceed. But when the king had heard the same, He sent his warriours forth with speed: For he was wroth to heare the fame, And worse displeased with the deed. Those murtherers destroyed he, And causd their Citie burnt to be. Vnto his seruants he sayd then, The wedding truly is prepard: Vnworthie were those wicked men, That would so lightly it regard; Go ye therefore to the high way, And bring me guests without delay. The seruants went and so they did, They brought him guests both good and bad: For eu'ry one they met, they bid, To seeke to make their master glad; And so with guests they furnished The feast that he solemnized. The king came in his guests to see, And there he did perceiue anon, A man among the rest to be, That had no wedding garment on; This came not to adorne the feast, But to haue meate among the rest. The king vnto him quickly sayd, How camst thou hither in, my friend? And he then speachlesse all affrayd, Could by no meanes his cause defend. The king could soone his faults espie, For all his cloakt hypocrisie. Then to his seruants sayd the king, Bind him, and take him hence away: To vtter darknesse see you bring Him, bound both hand and foote, I say; There weepe and gnash his teeth shall he: Many are cal'd, few chosen be: Of paying tribute vnto Cæsar. The Pharisies tooke counsell then, How Christ in talke might tangled be: They sent vnto him Herods men, With their Disciples, this to see. Thus all their wits they busied still, To seeke to worke Christ Iesus ill. Master, sayd they, we know and see, That thou art true, and teachest right The way of God, and that with thee, Respect of man is verie light: Mans person thou doest not respect, But him that doth Gods will effect. Tell vs therefore how thinkest thou? May we to Cæsar tribute giue? Thy iudgement herein shew vs now, For this thing doth vs greatly grieue, To pay him that mislikes men more, The temple had alwayes before. Iesus knowing their wickednesse, Sayd, Hypocrites, why tempt ye me? Your deeds shew you to be no lesse, I cannot so deceiued be: The tribute money shew me soone, And you shall know what must be done. They brought a peny to him then, Whose Image (then sayd Christ) is this, And superscription (to those men?) Cæsars, sayd they, it surely is. Giue Cæsar, Cæsars things therefore, And God his due, for euermore. When they heard this, they maruelled, And left him then and went away: H s answer them astonished, So that they could not him gainsay. Yet left they not (such was their grace) To hate him, though they left the place. Christ confuted the Saduces, which denied the resurrection. The Saduces the same day came: The resurrection they deny, And all such men did fowly blame, That would beleeue it verily. These came, I say, to Christ that day, Their ignorance for to bewray. Master (sayd they) Moses hath sayd, Childlesse if that a man should dye, His brethren need not be affrayd, To take his wife successiuely, And mary her, to raise him seed, This law allowed was in deed. There were seu'n brethren here with vs, The first of them did wed a wife: And dying then it hap'ned thus, He left no child, that left this life, His wife vnto his brother he Did leaue also, his wife to be. The second, third, and all the rest, Did mary her, but had no seed: For ech of them as is exprest, One after other dy'd in deed; And last of all then dyed she, Whose wife in heau'n there shall she be? Then Iesus answered againe, And sayd vnto them verily, Ye are deceiued, this is plaine, In your conceit, and wot ye why? The Scripture ye at any hand, Nor yet Gods power vnderstand: For in the resurrection, Men do not mary wiues as then, But are in each condition As Angels are, not mortall men. But that the dead do rise againe, Haue ye not read, yea oft in vayne? I am sayd God, of Abraham, Of Isaac and Iacob in deed, Their God, and of all them that came Of them, by faith, or of their seed. Sure of the liuing God is he, Not of the dead, I say to thee. And when the people heard it, they Were all astonied at the same: But some his doctrine did obey, Some other shrunke away for shame: Which did his works and words despise, Nor would beleeue in any wise. The Pharisies demanded of Christ, which was the great commandement, and his answer. But when the Pharisies had heard, That Christ to silence then had brought: The Saduces, without regard, They then a shift against him sought, To worke his shame if it might be, And so assembling this agree. A Doctour of the Law therefore, Should aske him there a question, Tempting him then as before, And asking his opinion: Oh master, in the law which is The great commandment? tell me this. Then Iesus sayd to him againe, The Lord thy God him shalt thou loue With all thy heart, and eu'ry vayne, Thy soule, and what thy mind may moue: This is the great commaundement, To keepe it is expedient. The second is like vnto this; As thine owne selfe thy neighbour loue: On these commandements it is, The law and Prophets hang and moue. In first and last, the wiseman can Learne duties, due to God and man. To Iesus sayd the Pharisie, Master, thou hast sayd very true: There is but one God verily, To loue, feare, and serue him is due. Then Iesus sayd, Gods kingdome thou, Art not farre from, I tell thee now. Christ demanded of them how Christ the Messiah is the sonne of Dauid. While that the Pharisies were there, Gathred together as we find: Iesus did aske them without feare, Of Christ, what thinke ye in your mind? Whose sonne is he? they sayd againe, Christ Dauids sonne is very plaine. Christ sayd to them, how then doth he In spirit call him Lord, I pray. As in the Psalmes is for to see, The Lord vnto my Lord did say, Sit at my right hand till I make Thy foes thy foote-stoole, for thy sake. If Dauid cal'd him Lord, how then Is he his sonne, do you declare? And none of all those busie men Could answer him, as witnesse are Their works, they durst not, this is plaine, From that day aske him ought againe. The doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisies, sitting in Moses chaire was to be heard, but their liues and manners not to be followed. Iesus spake to the multitude, And his Disciples likewise then, (Not waighing the ingratitude, Of such malitious wicked men.) Commending of the Scribes their place, Though they themselues were voyde of grace. The Scribes and Pharisies do sit, In Moses seat, Christ Iesus sayd: All therefore what they bid is fit, That you obserue it vndelayd: But what they do, do not the same, They say and do not, to their shame. For heauie burdens they do bind, And on mens shoulders them they lay, Most grieuous to be borne in mind, Intollerable eu'ry way; But they themselues will not once proue, With any finger them to moue. All that they do is to be seene, To haue of men a prayse therefore: It is not now as it hath beene, They do dissemble more and more. For God would haue his word well knowne, And not vpon their clothes so showne. But they haue broad Philacteries, And Gods commandements in those Not in their hearts, these misteries Their fowle dissembling do disclose. What they about them written beare, The heart to haue it, fittest were. And other vanities among, That these men vse continually: They fringe their garments all along, For outward show assuredly. They loue the chiefest place and seate, In all assemblies, and at meate. And greetings in the market place, And masters to be call'd of men: Be not so call'd, least you disgrace Your call, and doctrine euen then. Christ onely master you may call, And ye your selues are brethren all. On earth your father, no man call, For one your father is in deed: He is in heau'n farre aboue all, And giueth you what you haue need. Be not call'd Doctours, for one is Your Doctour, euen Christ iwis. Let him that is the greatest, be As seruant vnto all the rest: Himselfe who so exalteth he, Shall be brought low: but this is best, That ye your selues do humble; so To be exalted where ye go. Christ cryed wo against the Scribes, Pharisies and Lawyers. Wo be to you, ye Scribes therefore, And Pharisies withall, I say, You hypocrites do euermore Shut men from heauen all that ye may: For in your selues ye do not go, Nor suffer them that would do so. Wo be to you, for ye deuoure The widowes houses craftily: Your prayers longer by an houre Ye make, to worke your trechery; Wherefore without compassion, You shall receiue damnation. Wo be to you (I say) againe, For ye do compasse sea and land To seeke one Proselite to gaine, That he your law may vnderstand. Which when he learnes then sure is he, Much more the child of hell then ye. Woe to you, ye guides so blind, Which say that who so vse to sweare By the temple, this oth doth bind No man, thereof he need not feare: But by the gold thereof, say ye, Who so do sweare, offenders be. Of both these things which do you deeme, To be in deed the holyest? The gold which you so much esteeme, Or temple of the mightiest? The gold it doth it beautifie, The temple it doth sanctifie. And who doth by the altar sweare, It is nothing as you do say: But so to do ye make men feare, By the offring, in any way. The gift or altar which thinke ye, The holiest of them both to be? Ye fooles and blind, the offering Is by the altar sanctifi'd: Who sweares by it, for any thing, Of this you may be certifi'd, He sweares by it and all things there, Therefore take heed how ye do sweare. Who by the temple sweareth, he By it, and by him sure doth sweare That dwels therein: and likewise ye That sweare by heau'n without all feare, Of God ye do sweare by the throne, And him that sitteth thereupon. Wo be to you ye Scribes (I say) And Pharisies so full of guile: Ye hypocrites is this the way, To cloake your cursed craft so vile? The least things that the law doth will, You keepe, and leaue the greatest still. Mint, annise, and cummin tith ye, And waightier matters leaue alone: The law commandeth these to thee But last of all to thinke vpon. For iudgement, mercy, and faith, are The chiefest things should be your care. Ye blind and wicked guides, which straine A gnat, as if ye could not well Deuour the same except with paine, And swallow vp a great cammell: Ye hypocrites, for cloaking so Your craftinesse, you heape on wo. Wo be to you (I say againe,) For ye make cleane the vtter side Of cup and platter, all in vaine, It doth bewray your foolish pride: But they within, are not the lesse Of briberie full, and all excesse. Thou blind and foolish Pharisie, Cleanse first the inside of the same, And then the out-side verily, Thou mayst make cleane without all blame: If that the inner man be pure, The outward man is cleane be sure. Wo be to you, for sure ye be Like painted tombes in outward sight: Appearing fayre to them that see No part within, how they are dight: For lead mens bones are there doubtlesse Remaining with much filthinesse. So ye also, for outwardly Ye do as righteous men appeare, But are full of hypocrisie, And vices, it is very cleare: The outward man is fayre in show, And fowle within, as God doth know. Wo be to you that build so braue The Prophets tombes that were before, And garnish outwardly each graue Of righteous men, now more and more: And more then that you verily, Thus vtter your iniquitie. If we as then had bene (ye say) In our forefathers time, had we Consented so to see the day, That guiltlesse bloud then spilt should be? The Prophets had not dyed so, Nor any godly man with wo. So then ye are as witnesses Vnto your selues, how that ye be Their children, as ye do confesse, That murthred them, therefore do ye What lacked of their crueltie, Fulfill with all dexteritie. O Serpents the ofspring in deed, And bloudy generation Of vypers, and their very seed By nature and opinion: How ye should scape no man can tell, The great damnation of hell. Wherefore behold, to you Ile send, Prophets, wisemen, and Scribes surely, To see if that ye will amend, Whom ye will kill and crucifie, And scourge in Synagogues apace, And persecute from place to place. That on you all the bloud may come, Which was shed vpon earth alway, From righteous Abell, Adams sonne, To Zacharias, bloud which lay Betweene the temple verily, And altar, slaine most cruelly. All these things shall assuredly Come on this generation, This age shall beare this penaltie, And righteous condemnation, That all their vayne hypocrisie, May be detected openly. Hierusalem which killest so, The Prophets that are sent to thee, And stonest some t'augment their wo, How often would I, tell it me, Thy children gather for their good, Which they most frowarly withstood? Yea euen as a carefull hen Doth clocke her chickens, so haue I: And yet will not these wicked men Be saued from their miserie: All wast and desolate shall be, Their dwellings left that lothed me. For vnto you, marke it, I say, Ye shall not hence-forth see me more, Vntill ye blesse the very day, And wish good hap for euermore To him that commeth so with fame To you, in great Iehouahs name. As Iesus by the treasurie Beheld, what men did offer there, The rich and poore most bounteously Did cast therein, as may appeare: Of all the rest a widow then, Cast in two mites among those men. To his Disciples Iesus said, I say to you assuredly, She in this treasurie hath layd More then their superfluitie, She cast in all she had in store, They want no whit they had before. Of the destruction of the temple and Citie, and of the end of the world. When Iesus then had finished, To purge the temple as ye heard, And had also accomplished His iudgements heare before declard, He left the temple, then to go To Bethanie, whence he came fro. And this the third day after was The feast of Palmes, or Palme sunday: But ere he thence away could passe, Thus his Disciples to him say; Come Lord, and see this building here, How beautifull it doth appeare. And Iesus said to them againe, See ye these things and marke them all? There shall not verily remaine, One stone hereof that shall not fall. A stone shall not be left on stone, But shall be cast downe eu'ry one. And his Disciples came againe, As he vpon mount Oliues sate, And sayd, do thou now tell vs plaine, When this shall be, and of the state Of thy comming, and the worlds end, And what signe then thou wilt vs send. And Iesus answered and sayd, That you be not deceiu'd take heed: Great cause ye haue to be affrayd, Least you as others then should speed: For many shall come in my name, And deceiue many with the same. And ye shall heare of warres, I say, And rumours of warres there shall be: Let not all this your minds dismay Or trouble, though the same ye see: These things to come no man may let, But sure the end is not as yet. One nation shall first arise Against another nation: And realme with realme shall in this wise, Fall into great contention. Pestilence, and famine then, And earthquakes, shall vexe diuerse men. For these assuredly shall be, And that in diuerse places so, That who so shall those troubles see, And plagues, shall sore lament for wo. Of sorowes and also of care, All these things but beginnings are. Then yon deliuer'd vp shall be, By men to be afflicted fore: They shall kill you, take this of me, Ye shall be hated more and more Of nations, for my names sake, Which you contentedly must take. Offended then shall many be, And one another shall betray: And hatred in the highst degree, Shall among men beare too great sway. False Prophets also shall arise, Which shall deceiue the worldly wise. And then because iniquitie, Shall be increased day by day, The loue of many verily, Shall be as cold as clod of clay: But to the end who doth endure, Shall saued be, of this be sure. When this Gospell of the kingdome, Shall preached be in eu'ry place Throughout the world; sure then shall come, The end within a litle space. This witnesse to both good and bad, Encreaseth ioy or maketh sad. These are the signes that Christ foretold, Should come ere thy destruction, Thou Citie that to sinne art sold, Still working thy confusion: Hierusalem thou wilt not see, Nor yet receiue health sent to thee. Therefore seducers shall arise, Warres and rumours of warres shall be: The pestilence in raging wise, And famine in the highst degree: Earthquakes which may not be withstood, And persecution of the good. Offences publike in each place, And verie wicked trecherie, False Prophets many wanting grace, Deceiuing many subtilly: Of maners much corruption, Stained with all pollution. Loue cold among the greatest sort Of brethren then shall likewise be: Yet for the faithfull this comfort, Ere then they shall be sure to see The Gospell preached euerie where: And then the end shall soone appeare. And therefore this shall be the end, Which you must marke aduisedly, For few shall then find out a frend, There will be such calamitie: When former signes are come to passe, The end is worse then all that was. For then Ierusalem shall be With men besieged round about: Let them consider then that see What Daniell spoke: it is no doubt The great abhomination, Of thy iust desolation. This standing in the holy place When ye do see, marke what I tell, Let him that reades while he hath space, This prophecie consider well. Then let them which in Iewrie be, From thence into the mountaines flee. Let him that is on the house top, Not come downe thence to fetch away Ought that he hath in house or shop, Least lingring there by such delay He loose the oportunitie, Offred for his commoditie. And he that in the field is then, Let him not go backe home againe, To fetch his clothes, though this to men May seeme to be exceeding paine, The time shall then require no lesse, Then I to you do now expresse. Then wo to them with child shall be, And them that do giue such also: For these are most vnapt to flee, And therefore subiect to all wo. That your flight be not, see you pray. In winter or the Sabboth day. For then great troubles shall be sure, Such were not since the world began: Nor shall be while the world endure, That saued scarce should be a man, If for th' elect it happened, Those dayes should not be shortened. If any then to you do say, Lo here is Christ, or Christ is there, Beleeue it not: for at that day, False Christs and Prophets shall appeare, And shall shew signes and wonders such, As will deceiue men very much. Those false Christs and false Prophets shall Gods chosen very neare deceiue, If possible it were at all, As then you shall full well perceiue. Behold I haue told you before, Haue alwayes care hereof therefore. Wherefore if they vnto you say, Behold he in the desert is: Go not forth after him that way, For you shall find vntruth in this. In secret if they say he be, Beleeue it not, it is not he. For as the lightning from the East, Doth come and that most sodainly, And shineth forth into the West, So shall it be assuredly: The sonne of man shall come I say, In like sort at the iudgement day. For where the dead carcasse doth rest, The eagles will resort thereto, If that it be by East or West, Such fowle vnto their pray will go. Gods chosen shall to Christ that day Resort, as these vnto their pray. After those dayes immediatly, And all those troubles, then forth-right, The sunne shall darken by and by, And eke the moone shalt not giue light: The starre; of heauen they shall fall, And powres thereof shall shake withall. And lo, in heau'n shall sure appeare, The signe of Christ his comming then, And much shall mourne then eu'ry where, All kindreds and all tribes of men. Then in the clouds Christ comming he, Most glorious all men shall see. And he his Angels foorth shall send, With sound of trumpe that is so shrill: On the elect they shall attend, And gather them as he doth will, From the foure winds and eu'rie where, In one together to appeare. The Parable of the Figge tree. Now learne the parable, I say, Of the figge tree, whose boughs shut out And bearing leaues, do well bewray Sommer at hand without all doubt: So all these things when ye do see, Gods kingdome neare know then to be. This generation verily Passeth not, vntill all be done, As you haue heard effectually: The Lord will it accomplish soone. Both heau'n and earth shall passe away, But my words sure shall not decay. Christs comming shall be as the dayes of Noah were, sudden and vnlooked for. No man doth know that houre or day, No, not the Angels, be ye sure: My father onely, this I say, Doth onely know that day and houre: For as the dayes of Noë haue bene, So shall Christs comming then be seene. As in the dayes before the flood, They did both eate and drinke also, Marrie, and else what they thought good, Till he the Arke had gone into. All this we may in Moses see, How he and his from flood were free. And all the rest did nothing know, Till that the flood tooke them away: It shewes how they were verie slow For to repent their sinnes that day. Christs comming shall as suddenly Be seene, as that was verily. Two men shall in the field be then, The one of them receiu'd shall be, The other of those verie men, To be refused sure is he. Two women grinding then at mill, The good receiu'd, but not the ill. A warning to all men to be watchfull. Wake therefore and be warie men, For ye know not what houre or day Your maister comes, lest sleeping then You with the reprobate decay. Watch that with the elected sort Receiu'd ye be, to your comfort. Of this be sure, if the good man, The houre the theefe will come may know, He will keepe watch all that he can, To saue his house from hurt I trow. Be likewise readie alwayes then, For Christ will come ye know not when. A faithfull seruant and a wise, Made ruler of his masters men: His masters trust will not despise, But feedeth them in season then When he is absent, as he were Still present with his seruants there. That seruant blessed is in deed, Whom his master when he doth come, Shall find so doing, he shall speed, Be sure, of some especiall roome: His master will make him therefore, Ruler of all he hath in store. But if the euill seruant say, My master will not come as yet: And smite his fellowes day by day, And still with drunkards drinke and eate, His master will come when that he Expecteth not him for to see. Him he will cut off from the rest, And giue to him his portion With hypocrites, this is the least, That after condemnation, He shall both weepe and gnash for wo, His teeth that he applied so. The Parable of the ten Virgines. The kingdome sure of heau'n shall be Vnto ten virgines likened, Which tooke their lampes and went to see, If they could meete (as happened) The bridgrome, comming by that way, For whom all they together stay. Yea virgines they were all in deed, Such find this spouse assuredly, As chastly haue in heart decreed, On Christ to call vnfainedly, And not on idols, for they must Repose in Christ their onely trust. Yet onely fiue were wise of these, And fiue were foolish certainly, Which had their lampes the bride to please, And went to meete him solemnely. The former fiue had oyle all night, The last had none to saue their light. Now while the bridegrome taried long, All slumbred and slept heauily: There was at midnight heard among The Vingins, sodainly this cry; Behold, the bridgrome comes this way, Go meete him forth without delay. Then all those Virgins quickly rose, And trym'd their lampes away to go: The foolish Virgins sayd to those That wiser were, giue vs also Some of your oyle, our lampes to saue, Our lampes are out, no oyle we haue. The wise thus answer'd them againe, Lest there be not inough we feare For vs and you, therefore take paine, To go and buy some oyle elsewhere. Their foolishnesse deserued blame, For while they went the bridegrome came. And they that then were ready, went Into the wedding with the bride, And they that there were not present, Were shut out at that very tyde. And when they came and knocked fast, This answer they receiu'd at last. I know you not that cry and call, Lord, Lord do open vs this gate: Nor you may not come in at all, Your knocking now is to to late: Sith, ye know not the houre or day, That Christ doth come, watch still and pray. The Parable of the Talents. For the kingdome of heau'n, it is Like to a man that went from home, To a strange countrey farre from his, But causd his seruants first to come: To whom he did deliuer tho, His goods, ere he from home would go. To one he gaue then Talents fiue, And to another onely two: He one vnto the third did giue, Each one had something then to do, As they were able; and straight-way, He did depart, that very day. Then he that the fiue Talents had, Went and did occupie the same, And gayn'd to make his master glad, Fiue Talents more before he came. He that likewise receiued two, Did gayne therewith as many mo. But he that had receiued one, Within the earth did digge the same, And hid the money with a stone, To keepe vntill his master came. Thus eu'ry one did occupy, Their masters Talents diuersly. And after a long season came, Their master home to them againe: They reckned with him for the same, And gaue accounts of all their gaine: One after other as they could. What they had done, to him they told. He came first that fiue Talents had, And brought with him fiue Talents mo: And sayd, ô master here (be glad) Thy money is, and gaines also: For I haue gained as much more, As I haue receiu'd of thee before. To him his master said againe, Well done good seruant sure thou hast: That thou therewith did'st take such paine, Thou shalt receiue reward at last: Enter thy masters ioy to take, Of much I will thee ruler make. He came that did receiue likewise, Two Talents, and he thus did say: O master, thou mayst not despise, These gaines since thou went'st hence away: Here is thy money that I had, And as much more that I haue made. His master vnto him did say, Good seruant, sure it is well donne: The time thou spendest well alway, Else couldst not thou so much haue wonne: Thy faithfulnesse in this was such, I will thee ruler make of much. Then he which had receiued one, Came to his master, and did say, When thou a way from hence wast gone, I hid thy money without nay, Because I fear'd thy cruelty. Here, take thine owne contentedly. His master answered and sayd, Thou ill and slouthfull seruant, why (If thou of me art so affrayd, And knowst so well my crueltie) Didst not thou find some meane or way, To get me gaines against this day? The Talent from him take therefore, And giue it him that now hath ten: For who so hath, he shall haue more, And he shall haue abundance then. From him that hath not, shall away Be taken all he hath, I say, That seruant voyde of profit, ye To vtter darknesse therefore cast: There weepe and gnash his teeth shall he, Thus shall his slouth be payd at last. See then your Talent fructifie, Least you loose it eternally. The manner of the last Iudgement. When that the sonne of man comes to The Iudgement, with great maiesty, His holy Angels all also, Shall be with him most gloriously: And he shall sit vpon the throne Of glorie, iudging eu'ry one. All nations shall be gathered, Before the sonne of man as then, And there they shall be seuered, The godly from the wicked men, As shepheards seperate their sheepe, From flockes of goats that they do keepe. The sheepe, whereby are ment the best, He shall set then on his right hand: The goates, by which are ment the rest, On the left side of him shall stand: So shall the King to the good men, Pronounce this louing sentence then; Ye blessed of my father come, Inherite you the kingdome here, Prepared ere the world begon, For you (of him) as doth appeare: For when I wanted food to eate, Ye gaue me lodging, drinke and meate. Ye clothed me, that naked was, Me, being sicke, ye came to see: Imprisoned, ye did not passe, Vntill ye had relieued me, My wants supplying willingly, And comforting my miserie. Then shall the righteous, say againe, Lord, when saw we thee in such case? And then the King without disdaine, Shall answer them; in eu'ry place, In as much as ye haue done this, To these my brethen, mine it is. Then shall he to the other say, (The wicked goates on the left hand) Depart ye cursed hence away, All, as ye do together stand: Go into fire vnquencheable, Prepared for the damnable. For when I hungred verie sore, Ye gaue me then nothing to eate; And oft I thirsted more and more, Yet wanted drinke, as well as meate: Ye lodged not, nor clothed me, Nor sicke in prison would me see. They aske when they had seene him so: He answereth now as before: Therefore he saith, that these shall go, To suffer paine for euermore. But sure the righteous shall then all, Go and possesse life eternall. Christ in the Temple taught by day, And there-hence out at night he went To Oliuet the readie way, Where that time he then alwayes spent: To heare him dayly many came, So much was spread abroad his fame. Another Sermon of the Crosse, which Christ made to his Disciples in Bethanie, at Simon the leapers house. When Iesus had thus finished These sayings, he began to say To such as him then followed, From place to place so eu'ry day; Ye know within two dayes will be The feast of passeouer, sayd he. And then shall be deliuered, The sonne of man (as heretofore I told you) to be crucified, Although it grieue you verie sore: The time, is come that death the iust, For sinfull men needs suffer must. The chiefe Priests were then assembled, The Scribes and eke the Elders all, Where they this thing delibered, (Within the high Priest Cayphas hall) How Iesus might by subtiltie Be had, and killed cruellie. But they sayd, not on the feast day, Least any vproare there should be Among the people any way, If they the same should hap to see: The people him do magnifie, Whom we desire to crucifie. Then Iudas tooke occasion, (Set forward by the deuill in deed, To be of such opinion, Which caused him so ill to speed) When Christ did sup in Bethany, At Simons house assuredly. Where Mary did annoynt the Lord, With pretious oyntment that she had, As Christ was there set at the boord, Which made the traytour Iudas mad: He thought it wast that so was spent, Reuenge it therefore thus he ment. He went to the chiefe Priests, and sayd, What will ye now giue vnto me, If I deliuer vndelayd, Christ to your hands? what then say ye? All thirtie pence they said againe, We will giue thee if thou take paine. And from that time, as most suppose, He sought all oportunitie For to betray him vnto those, That hired him so liberallie: For all his mind was fully set, By hooke or crooke some gaines to get. The Disciples demand of Christ, where he would they should prepare the passeouer. The first day of vnleauened bread, Peter came vnto Christ and Iohn, (Whom they acknowledged their head) And askd of him this question; Where wilt thou that we do prepare, To eate the passeouer declare? Then he thus vnto them did say, Go ye into the Citie both, And you shall meete one in your way, Marke whither that the same man goeth: You shall see him a pitcher beare, Of water full, when you come there. Go ye and follow him into The house he goeth in, and say To the good man, we pray you do Shew the chamber our master may Eate passeouer, and he forth right Will shew a chamber ready dight. So the Disciples found in deed, As Christ before to them did say: And they prepar'd for him with speed, To eate the passeouer that day. So when the euen was now late, Christ came and with the twelue he sate. As they did eate, Christ sayd againe, Assuredly to you, I say, You shall see this (though to his paine) That one of you shall me betray. Then the Disciples sorie were, And of this saying stood in feare. Now there was one whom Christ did loue, That leaned then vpon his breast: Him Peter did with signes so moue, That he demanded for the rest; Tell vs (ô Lord) we do thee pray, Who is it that shall thee betray? And Iesus sayd, the hand is here At this boord, that betrayeth me, (As to you all it will appeare) And in the dish now dippeth he. He lift his heele against his head, That eateth with me of this bread. The sonne of man shall surely go, As of him it hath written beene: But to that man be euer woe, By whose deuise the same is seene. It had bene good for him, I say, He had not yet bene borne this day. Then Iudas which did Christ betray, Answer'd and said, sir is it I? The traitour thought to find a way, To cloake his treason craftily. Then Christ said, thou hast sayd in deed, As I haue sayd, so shall I speed. Christ washed his Disciples feete. Christ knowing that the father had Giuen all things into his hand, (Whereof all men may be right glad, That truly this will vnderstand) And that from God come forth was he, And went to God, with him to be. He rising from his supper, layd His vpper garments all aside, And tooke a towell, it is sayd, And withall girt himselfe that tyde: Christ Iesus did this verily, To teach vs true humilitie. Christ powred in a basin then, Water to wash their feete withall, He humbling him among his men, Did with a towell wipe them all: Thus vsd he all simplicitie, To teach vs still humilitie. To Simon Peter then he came, Who sayd, what doest thou Lord to me? To wash my feete it were my shame, Therefore good Lord, this may not be. What I do now, sayd Christ, at all Thou knowst not, but hereafter shall. But Peter sayd, thou shalt not now, O master, wash my feete, I say. Then Iesus sayd, cleane art not thou, Nor mayst be if thou disobay: For Peter if I wash not thee, Thou shalt haue sure no part with me. And Simon Peter sayd againe, Lord, not my feete all onely then, But head and hands if thou take paine, And wilt such fauour shew to men. Christ sayd, whose feete is washed so, Is cleane, and needs not any mo. And ye are cleane although not all, For he knew who should him betray: He knew him well before his fall, How fowly he would slide away: But to repent he had no grace, Though he were checkt in eu'ry place. So after that he washed had Their feete, and tooke his clothes againe, And was set downe, as alwayes glad He was, for his to take all paine; Know ye, sayd he, what I haue donne? Do ye therefore as I begonne. Ye call me Lord, and master well, For so in very deed I am: If I your Lord, that so excell, Most humble for your sakes became, Ye ought each others feete therefore To wash, as I haue done before. Example vnto you gaue I, That you as I haue done, should do: The seruant was not certainly Aboue his master, hitherto, Nor the ambassadour I say, Greater then who sent him away. If ye know these things I declare, And do them, then blessed are ye: It is a vertue verie rare, Among most men the same to see. All this he spake to them assoone As he of washing them had done. Christ instituted the Sacrament of his holie Supper. And as they sate all then at meate, Iesus tooke bread, and brake the same, And giuing thankes, gaue it to eate, To them that thither with him came: And sayd, take, eate ye all of this, My body for you giuen is. Also he tooke the cup, when he Had giuen thankes, and gaue it those: Saying, of it now drinke all ye, (This cup see ye do so dispose As I haue taught you) still, sayd he, Receiuing this, remember me. For this it is my bloud truly, Of the new Testament I make, For many shed assuredly, Thereby their sinnes away to take: Who so hath not remission By it, hath iust damnation. Hence-forth of this fruit of the vine, I will not drinke, vntill that day When I shall drinke it new with mine, And that Gods kingdome come I say. When Supper thus all finisht was, Christ Iesus song a Psalme for grace. And Iudas that did Christ betray, (Assoone as Sathan prickt him on) Departed thence and went away: But Iesus sayd ere he was gone, What is deuised secretly, Go Iudas do it speedily. But none of them that then were there, Knew why the Lord sayd to him so: The bagge, thought they, Iudas doth beare, And therefore he doth bid him go To giue the poore what he thinkes best, Or to prouide against the feast. When he was gone out, Iesus sayd, The sonne of man is glorified, And God in him, be not affrayd, For you in both are sanctified: As God, in the sonne verily, So he the sonne will glorifie. Christ departed thence into the mount of Oliues, where as also by the way he comforted and strengthened his Disciples. When Iesus thus fore-warned had All them, of that which happened, To comfort them and make them glad, Against his death which hastened, They passed thence though it was night, And to mount Oliues they went right. Where he, as also by the way, Admonisht them, and comforted, To loue together, and I ?l?ay, Against the deu'll them strengthened: For Christ did know it well before, They should be tempted ve[illeg.]ore. This night, sayd he, you shall be all Offended much because of me: For when the shepheard hath a fall, The sheepe soone shall then scattred be: Yet after I am risen, I Will go with you to Galilie. O litle children, yet a while I am with you, ye shall seeke me: Let not the deu'll you then beguile, Where I go, yet, come cannot ye: Let this therefore I say, you moue, Each one another for to loue. By this shall all men know indeed, That my Disciples sure ye are, If each one helpe anothers need, And to the world your loue declare. Loue, is the badge and onely signe, That men may best know you for mine. Then Simon Peter sayd, I pray, Lord, tell me whither goest thou? O Simon where I go, I say, Thou canst not come and follow now, But afterwards I tell it thee, Thou shalt be sure to follow me. And Peter sayd Lord, why not now? My life! will loose for thy sake. Thy life for my sake loose wilt thou? No hast, said Christ, ô Simon make: The cocke shall not crow verily, Vntill thou do me thrise deny. And Iesus, sayd ô Simon see, Sathans desires assuredly, That you as wheate should winow'd be, This he attempted earnestly: But I for thee haue pray'd, I say, Thy faith so fayle not cleane away. And see when thou conuerted art, Thy brethen that thou strengthen then: But he said, though I suffer smart, And dye the death before all men, My master I will not deny, So said the rest, assuredly. And he sayd vnto them againe, When you without a bagge I sent, And scrip, and shoes, declare it plaine, What then ye lacked where ye went? Nothing sayd they, but now sayd he, To you these things may wanting be. See then of these things ye make store, And sell thy coat a sword to buy: The Scripture shall be euermore, In me performed certainly. They sayd, ô Lord, two swords haue we. It is inough, againe sayd he. Christ armed his Disciples with consolation against trouble, declaring that he is the way, the truth, and the life. Though otherwise he knew it well, It would fall out immediatly, Then they sayd: yet for to expell Their feare, he arm'd them gratiously; Let not your hearts now troubled be, Ye trust in God, do so in me. And dwelling places many are, Within my fathers house, I say: For you I go, place to prepare, That be there, where I am, ye may: Yet I will come to you againe, And you receiue without disdaine. Now ye know whither that I go, And likewise ye do know the way. Then Thomas sayd, Lord, no not so, We know it not, nor know it may, Except thou shew it, how should we Know well the way to go with thee? Then Iesus sayd, I am the way, I am the truth, and life also: Come to the father no man may, Except that he by me do go. Full well my father knoweth he, That perfectly hath knowen me. Philip sayd, Lord, it will suffise, If thou let vs thy father see: Then Iesus answer'd in this wise, O Philip he that hath seene me, Hath seene my father verily: Beleeue the same vnfainedly. Beleeu'st thou not that sure I am In the father, and he in me: The wordes I speake, from him they came, The works I do, all them doth he: I am in him, so do it take, At least beleeue for the worke sake. In deed, in deed, to you I say, Who firmely doth beleeue in me, The works I do, do them he may, And greater works then these shall he. That man shall sure be blessed so, For I vnto my father go. What ye aske in my name, Ile do, That in the same my father may Be glorifi'd, I hither to Haue euer taught you so to pray. Withall I say, if ye loue me, See my preceptes obserued be. Christ sayd, the father I will pray, And he another comforter Shall giue to you, that the same may Abide and be with you euer. Gods spirit sure on you shall be, A teacher of all truth is he. I will not leaue you comfortlesse, But I will come to you againe, And then to you I will expresse, How in the father I remaine: The world shall not these things perceiue, Because it will not me receiue. Then Iudas sayd vnto him, Lord, (Not Iudas that the traitour was) Why doest thou not as well accord, To graunt vnto the world this grace? To shew thy selfe to them also, As vnto vs thou mean'st to do? He that my precepts will obay, And keepeth them, he loueth me: He that doth keepe my word, I say, Lou'd of my father he shall be; What I say therefore marke it well, For we will come with him and dwell. The comforter the holy Ghost, The father will send in my name: He will see that no word be lost, That out of my mouth euer came. Let not your heart be mou'd to feare, Peace with you I leaue eu'ry where. That I do go, and come againe, Might giue you cause with heart and voyce, To laud the father, God certaine, And so much more in heart reioyce, In that I tell you this before, You may beleeue me euermore. I will not many things to you Speake after this, as I haue donne: The Prince of this world commeth now, Yet he in me hath nothing wonne: But this I do that men may see, I loue the father, he loues me. The Parable of the Vine. I am the true and perfect vine, My father is an husband man: Each braunch that is not truly mine, He cuts away that cut it can: And each one that beares fruit in me, He makes more fruitfull for to be. Through the word I haue spoken now, Ye are assuredly made cleane: Abide in me and I in you, If to beare fruit ye euer meane. As branches cut of fruitlesse be, So you, except you bide in me. I am the vine, ye branches are, He that abideth still in me, And I in him, he need not care, Much fruit in him shall euer be. Giue eare and listen hereunto, Ye can without me nothing do. He that abideth not in me, Is cut off as a with'red bough, And to the fire cast then is he, Where he is punisht sore inough. In me abide, aske what ye will, And your request I will fulfill. My father he is glorified, In that ye beare much fruit in me: And we are both much honored, If ye together louing be. This ought you greatly thereto moue, That I (as he lou'd me) you loue. Sure greater loue can no man beare Then this, when one doth for his friend, Bestow his life, to him so deare, Which I do onely to this end, To keepe safe mine from all annoy, That they in me might still haue ioy. Ye are my friends, if ye do serue What I do both command and show: The hireling doth his master serue, His secrets yet he doth not know. All that I of my father heard, The same to you I haue declar'd. Ye haue not chosen me before, I first chose you, I tell you plaine, To bring forth fruit still more and more, And that your fruit it might remaine: That what so ye aske in my name, My father may giue you the same. Loue one another I command, The world doth hate you, well ye know, The cause ye likewise vnderstand, Is that I haue so chosen you. If they haue persecuted me, So persecuted shall you be. If they haue kept my word before, They will keepe yours hereafter so: All those things they and rather more, For my name sake to you will do. Against me and mine they are bent, Not knowing from whom I am sent. If I had not come, then in deed They should haue had no sinne at all: But now haue they no cloake at need, To hide their sinne that is not small. My father hates who hateth me, And they hate both, for all they see. But it is that the word might be Fulfilled, written in their law; Without a cause they hated me, Of my word they stand not in awe. The comforter shall testifie Of me, with you assuredly. Another Sermon of the Crosse: the Disciples comforted with promise of the holy Ghost: the comming of Christ againe: his Ascention: to aske in his name: peace in Christ, and affliction in the world to such as follow him. These things I haue vnto you sayd, That ye might not offended be: Nor that ye should be much affrayd, When from their Sinagogues that ye Be thrust out, for they shall you kill, And yet thinke that they do Gods will. These things they will vnto you do, Because that they haue not known me, Nor yet the father hitherto These things I say to you, that ye May thinke on it for euermore, That I haue told you this before. I tell it now, because I go Hence vnto him that did send me, And none of you though grieued so, Doth aske of me, what ay leth thee? Or whither goest thou a way? And yet ye sorow all ye may. Yet surely this to you say I, It is expedient I go: For if I go not hence truly, The comforter he comes not so As I haue sayd, thinke this in heart, I will send him when I depart. When he is come, he will reproue, The world of sinne, because men do Distrust in me, whom thy should loue: Of righteousnesse, because I go To my father, from hence away, You shall see me no more, I say. Of iudgement, shall the world likewise Reproued be by him as then: Because their Prince then iudged is, And righteousnesse restor'd to men: For Sathans empire hath a fall, And Gods annointed ruleth all. I haue yet many things to say, But ye cannot them now well beare: The comforter will not delay, To tell you all things, do not feare. He shall shew you mine verily, And so he shall me glorifie. A litle while and surely ye Sall not see me, and yet againe After a while ye shall see me, For I go where I must remaine. But they had not as then the reach, For to perceiue what Christ did teach. Therefore he sayd to them againe, Assuredly to you I say, You shall weepe and be full of paine, Yet shall the world reioyce that day. Though sorow do you much annoy, Your sorow shall be turn'd to ioy. A woman when she trauaileth, Hath sorow that her houre is nye; As soone as she deliuereth Her child, then she immediatly, Her anguish doth not thinke vpon, For ioy of him, her paine is gone. So now ye sorow at the heart, But I will see you sure againe, Though for a time I do depart, Ile come to ease you of your paine: And then your ioy shall be so great, As you may neuer it forget. Ye shall aske nothing then of me, But of my father in my name: And what ye aske shall giuen be, Be most assured of the same. In my name ye askt nothing yet, Aske, ye shall haue, nothing shall let. In Parables these things I spake, But sure the time will come, when I A plainer speach to you shall make, And preach the father openly. What in my name ye aske, that he Will giue, because ye loued me. For from the father out I came Into the world, and out againe, I do depart, and leaue the same, And go to him there to remaine. Thou speakest now so plaine, we see, That no man more needs aske of thee. Now we beleeue thou cam'st from God. The houre is come then Iesus sayd, Ye shall tast of a bitter rod, And scattred be, be not affrayd, From me though you be fled and gone, The father leaues me not alone. These things I speake to comfort you, And that in me, you might haue peace: For in the world assured now, Afflictions for you do increase. Be of good comfort: verily The world now ouercome haue I. The prayer of Christ vnto the father for his elect. After that Christ had preached long To his Disciples, of the crosse, He mingled comforts all among, Lest they dispayr'd for such a losse. He prayed God them to protect, And this his doctrine to effect. And Iesus lift his eyes on hye, And sayd, the houre, ô father deare, Is come, thy sonne then glorifie, That so thy glorie may appeare. As thou him power gau'st of all, So he gaue his life eternall. And this is sure eternall life, That they the onely God know thee, And whom thou hast sent (without strife Acknowledge) Iesus Christ to be. The worke thou gauest me to do, I to thy glorie finish'd to. Now glorifie thou me againe, With thine owne selfe (ô father deare) As when I did with thee remaine, Ere heau'n and earth did first appeare: Thy name to those declared I, Thou gauest me, accordingly. They kept thy word, and know withall, That all I haue are come of thee: They did obay when I did call, Beleeuing that thou hast sent me. For those thou gauest me, alway For them, not for the world, I pray. As they and else all mine are thine, And I in them am glorified: So thine vndoubtedly are mine, Thou hast thy sonne so fauored, I in the world am now no more, But they are as they were before. O father, keepe them in thy name, Those that thou hast so giuen me: As one in deed we both became, That so they may for euer be. I kept them safe, I lost not one, Saue that child of perdition. I speake these things, and come to thee, That they in them might haue my ioy: Thy word is giuen them of me, Yet will the world much them annoy; It hates them, for both they and I Are not of this world, verily. Out of the world I do not pray, That thou shouldst take them by and by, But that from euill night and day Thou keepe, and giue them victory, In all their combats, when they craue, Thy helpe (ô father) let them haue. They are not of this world, nor I, Thy word it is the truth in deed; Therewith do thou them sanctifie, And helpe them father at all need. As to the world thou didst send me, So these of me sent likewise be. And for their sakes I sanctifie My selfe, that through the truth they may Be sanctified assuredly. For them I do not onely pray, But for them also which affoord Firme faith in me, Lord, through thy word. That they all may be one, as thou (O father) art in me, and I In thee was, and am present now, So they may all be verily Made one in vs, that the world may Beleeue thou hast sent me this day. The glory that thou gauest me, I gaue them, that they may be one As we are one, that they might be Knowne the Disciples of thy sonne: And that as me thou louest those, Whom so out of this world I chose. I will (ô father) that they be With me, where euer that I am, That there the glory they may see, Which thou hast giuen to my name. Thou louedst me, ere thou began To make this world, and create man. The world (ô father) knowes not thee, But I haue knowne thee and so these Haue knowne in deed that thou sentst me. Thy name to them whom thou doest please I will declare: thereby to moue, There may in them be perfect loue. The Passion of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and first of his prayers in mount Oliuet, where he sweat drops of bloud, and an Angell came and comforted him. When Iesus these things spoken had, Ouer brooke Cedron then he went With his Disciples, who were sad, When they perceiued what he ment. Some Gethsemane do name the place, This garden in mount Oliues was. And Iudas which did him betray, Did likewise know the place full well: And knew that Christ would walke that way, As then most truly it befell. For thither oft to their comfort, With his, Christ vsed to resort. When he was come into the place, He chose of his Disciples three, To watch and pray with him a space, To whom he sayd, go ye with me: And so he went aside to pray, And left the rest behind to stay. And these were Peter, Iames, and Iohn, That he tooke then with him apart; They so with sleepe were ouer gone, That they perciu'd not all his smart. These on mount Thabor verily, Had seene before his maiestie. Where they as witnesse chosen were By him, of his diuinitie: And now that likewise may appeare To them his great humilitie. He chose no more, because by three, All things well witnessed may be. Then to waxe heauie he began, And sorowfull as all affrayd: Sore troubled was the outward man, He thus to his Disciples sayd; My soule is heauie verily, Yet I must needs now yeeld to dye. Now tary here and watch with me, While I go yonder for to pray: A litle further then went he, And falling on his face, did say, Let this cup passe (ô father mine) Yet not my will be done, but thine. And there from heauen did appeare, Him comforting an Angell then: The waight of sinne that he did beare, So pressed him (for mortall men) That he sweat drops of bloud apace, Which trickled downe along his face. Then vp from prayer he arose, And his Disciples came vnto: But he all sleeping there found those, For heauinesse opprest them so. Why sleepe ye, then sayd Christ I say Arise, watch earnestly, and pray. The flesh is weake and fraile also, But yet the spirit ready is: Pray least ye enter now into Temptation in any wise; And so againe he went away, Where he then (as before) did pray. At his returne to them againe The second time, they were a sleepe, Their eyes were heauie, they in vaine Did labour, waking them to keepe: They knew they had deserued blame, And could not answer him for shame. So he left them, and went away, (He saw they could not well awake) And as before againe did pray, Thus thrise he did his prayers make. To his Disciples then sayd he, Take rest and sleepe henceforth may ye. Behold, the houre is now at hand, And ready come assuredly: This you shall shortly vnderstand, That sure the sonne of man shall dye; Into the hands of sinners he Shall presently deliu'red be. Iudas the traitour with a band of men, and officers, which he receiued of the high Priests and Pharisies, came thither with lanternes, torches and weapons to take Iesus. Now let vs go, I say arise, He commeth that doth me betray: The traitour Iudas on this wise, Was then set forward in his way, And neare approching to the place, Where Christ with his Disciples was. He had receiu'd a band of men, And officers also withall, That the high Priests allow'd him then, The number of them was not small: They with their weapons came all night, With lanterns and with torches light. The high Priests in all things were prest, Christ Iesus for to crucifie: The Pharisies they would not rest, Till Christ were slaine most cruelly. Therefore with Iudas they did send By night, men armed to that end; All which with Iudas then were come. As Christ to his Disciples spake, A token Iudas gaue to some, That they might know whom they should take; He whom I kisse it is the same, Lay hold on him, least you haue blame. But Christ whose might they could not match, If he had ment them to withstand, (Whom they by fraud or force would catch,) Went forth to meete them out of hand: Who with his word their weapons all, And they themselues did cause to fall. When Christ sayd to them, whom seeke ye? Iesus of Nazareth, they say. He answer'd and sayd, I am he, And so they all went backe away, And to the ground they did thereat, As men amazed fall downe flat. Then he sayd vnto them againe, Whom seeke ye after tell it me? Iesus of Nazareth certaine, They answered is euen he. Then Iesus sayd, sure here I am, For whom ye say, you hither came. If you seeke me let these men go, And quietly depart away: This was that his word might proue so, Which he of them before did say; Of them which thou hast giuen me, I haue not sure lost one, sayd he. Then Simon Peter drew a sword, And smote the high Priests seruant there: He minded to reuenge his Lord, And therefore cut of Malchus eare: For so they called him by name, He was one that with Iudas came. Put vp thy sword in sheath, sayd he, What sayest thou (ô Peter) now? The cup my father giueth me, Shall I not drinke of thinkest thou? The Scripture thus I must fulfill, That saith, it is my fathers will. Doest thou suppose I cannot pray My father, that he would giue me Twelue legions (as well he may,) Of Angels with me still to be? Then pressed Iudas Christ to kisse. Betray'st thou me, sayd Christ with this? Then to the multitude he sayd, The high Priests, and the Captains there: Ye be come out as men affrayd, Or as against a theefe it were, With swords, and staues: when I, sayd he, Did dayly teach, you tooke not me. Iesus was taken, bound, and brought to Annas first, and then to Cayphas. The Captaine, officers and band, Tooke Iesus, and they bound him then, And thence they led him out of hand, Among a sort of armed men. To Annas first, he father was To her that was wife of Cayphas. This Cayphas was high Priest that yeare, He to the Iewes this counsell gaue, How it expedient did appeare, That they the man as then should haue, Which there must for the people dye, Lest they should perish vtterly. This of himselfe then spake not he, But being high Priest propheci'd As Balam did, the Lords decree, Which he would faine haue contrari'd: But both of them were bridled so, They must obay would they or no. Now Simon Peter followed His master, and another then Of the Disciples, acquainted With the high Priests and with their men: This therefore by acquaintance went Into the hall, where Christ was sent. But Peter stood out at the doore, He was not friended there so well: The other that went in before, Came out to him as it befell, And spake to her that kept the gate, And so brought Peter in thereat. The high Priests, the Elders, and the whole Counsell sought false witnesse against Iesus: Peter denieth him thrise. Then sayd the mayd that kept the gate, Thou one of his Disciples art: But he deny'd it verie flat, And so from her he did depart. Then came he where the seruants were, And sate him downe among there. The high Priests and the Elders all, That then were met in Counsell there, Within the high Priest Cayphas hall, Sought such as would false witnesse beare, Whereby they might make Iesus dye, But they found none assuredly. Though many came that witnesse bare, Their witnesse yet did not agree; At last are found two men that dare False witnesses against him be. They vndertooke to iustifie, More then was true assuredly. They sayd, that they had heard him say, That he Gods temple could destroy, And build a fayrer eu'ry way, Within three dayes without annoy. Yet these as Marke doth testifie, Did not agree so perfectly. Then the chiefe Priest from seate arose, And asked Iesus on this wise, Why answerest thou not to those? Thou seest what witnesses arise, And testifie, as may appeare, A truth, against thee to vs here. But Iesus yet did hold his peace. The high Priest sayd to him againe, I charge thee that thou do no lesse, By God the Lord, but tell it plaine, If Christ the sonne of God thou be? Then Iesus sayd, I sure am he. And ye shall see the sonne of man, Sitting at the right hand of God, (Whose power to resist none can, Nor of himselfe escape his rod.) And in the clouds of heau'n shall ye, The sonne of man then comming see. The high Priest then his clothes did rent, And sayd, what need we any more Of witnesses for this intent? He openly blasphemeth sore. What thinke ye? then they cried all, Death he deserues, and dye he shall. They mocked Christ, that him did hold, And spat withall into his face: To strike him also they were bold, So much they were deuoyd of grace; With rods and fists most cruelly, They beat, and vsd him shamefully. Then sayd they to him, Prophesie, Which of vs all now hath done this: And other things as wickedly They did against him then deuise. But he most meekely suffred all, To bring vs sinners out of thrall. Now all this while there at the fire Did Simon sit, among them then: Another mayd did thus inquire, Art not thou one of this mans men? Though she affirm'd it to be so, Yet he deni'd it, saying no. Then they that stood by, sayd againe, One of them thou most surely art: Thy speach bewrayeth thee so plaine, Thou canst not hide it for thy heart. Then he to curse and sweare began, That he did neuer know the man. The cocke did crow then once againe, For Marke doth say he crowed twise: Man of himselfe is verie vaine, Peter deny'd his master thrise. The cocks crow could not let his fall, Till Christ did looke on him withall. Then he remembred what was sayd Of Iesus vnto him before; And then he went out all affrayd, And wept and wayled verie sore. Whom late no death could terrifie, Perceiu'd then his infirmitie. Christ was brought vnto Pylate then President of the Romanes: Iudas repentance and death. Then in the dawning of the day, The high Priests and the Elders did A counsell hold to find some way, By death Christ Iesus life to rid: Whom thence they led then hastily, Bound hand and foot most shamefully. From Cayphas vnto Pylats hall, Iesus condemned so of late, They brought bound by their counsell all; (Reioycing at his wofull state.) For they had no authoritie, Our Sauiour Christ to crucifie. Yet they into the common hall, Where Pylate did his iudgement giue Went not themselues, least thereby all (For so the Iewes did then beleeue) Should be defiled, and be let Thereby the passeouer to eate. While this was doing, marke the end That to the traitour Iudas fell: He was past grace for to amend, He loued Mammon to to well: Yet his offence displeasd him so, That he was wrapped all in wo. When by his meanes he did perceiue, His master was condemn'd to dye, An inward griefe he did conceiue, And did repent him mightely: But his repentance tooke no place, For it was voyde of faith and grace. The thirtie siluer peeces he Vnto the high Priest brought againe: I sinn'd, sayd he, and wo is me, Which haue procur'd my masters paine; It was because you thought it good, That I betrayd his guiltlesse bloud. What is that vnto vs, sayd they? Looke thou to that which thou hast done: Therein thou didst our hests obey, And we will end what is begon. In temple he the siluer cast, And went and hangd himselfe at last. The chiefe Priests tooke the siluer plate, And sayd, it is not lawfull we Do them put vp (such is our state) Among our treasure for to be. And why? the law doth so deuise, Because it is of bloud the price. Then they tooke counsell, and did buy A potters field; as did befall, For to fulfill the Prophesie, To be the strangers buriall: Wherefore that field is calld, I say, The field of bloud vntill this day. And to leaue of his tragedie, Let vs returne to Christ againe, Whom then the Iewes maliciously, For to accuse did take such paine; On Pylate they did cry and call, Though then they went not to the hall. Pylate went out to them, and sayd, What cause bring you against this man? The wicked Iewes nothing affrayd, For to accuse him thus began; An euill doer were not he, We would not haue brought him to thee. Then Pylate sayd to them againe, Take him, and iudge him by your law, We may not iudge him, it is plaine, Of Cæsar we do stand in awe. Christs word this was to verifie, When he foretold how he should dye. They charged Christ that found he was, Peruerting of the people there, Forbidding men from place to place, To pay their tribute any where Vnto Augustus, perswading That he was Christ their onely king. As Iesus in the iudgement hall, Before the gouernour did stand, He sayd to Christ before them all, Answer thou this now out of hand; Art thou king of the Iewes or no? And Iesus sayd, thou sayest so. The high Priests, and thy nation, Deliuered thee vnto me: Now tell me then what hast thou done, That they should so cry out on thee? They say thou art a naughtie man, Defend thy cause now if thou can. Then Iesus sayd, my kingdome is Not of this world, for if it were, My seruants sure would neuer misse, To fight for me without all feare, Ere I should thus deliuered be, Vnto the Iewes, as thou doest see. Then Pylate sayd, art thou a king? And Iesus sayd, thou sayst I am. I was borne for this verie thing, For this cause to the world I came, And witnesse of the truth to beare: My voyce he that loues, truth will heare. Pylate sent Christ to Herod, and they were made friends that day: Herod sent Christ backe to Pylate: Pylate warned by his wife sought by all meanes to deliuer Christ. Then to the high Priests Pylate sayd, I find no fault sure in this man: Their furie then could not be stayd, But fiercely thus they all began; He teacheth mouing mightily All, and begon at Galilie. When Pylate heard of Galilie, Is he a Galilean then? Sayd he; and forthwith hastily Sent Christ to Herod with his men: Heat Hierusalem then was, When all these things came so to passe. When Herod saw him, he was glad, For he desired him to see: And so his wish at last he had, Which neuer till that time would be. Such signes and wonders Herod thought He should haue seene, as Christ had wrought. He then with Christ there questioned, And did him many things demand: But Iesus nothing answered, For all king Herod could command. Though high Priests, Scribes and people all, Accused Christ in Herods hall. Then Herod with his men of warre, Mocking Christ, him in white array: (Pylate and Herod were at iarre, And were made friends that verie day.) And Christ so clad, Herod againe, Sent backe to Pylate it is plaine. Then he thus warned by his wife, Wrong not thou that iust man, sayd she: He sought all meanes to saue his life, But by those meanes it would not be. This made the Iewes yet almost mad, To heare what he deuised had. Ye haue brought this man vnto me, As who the people doth peruert: I haue examin'd him, ye see, And find in him no such desert, To punish him for any thing, That you against the man do bring. Nor Herod vnto whom ye went, Finds that he doth deserue to dye: For vnto Herod him I sent, Whom vncondemned verily He did send backe; sith it is so, Ile chasten him, and let him go. The gouernour was accustomed at that feast to let loose vnto the people a prisoner, whom they would: he offered to let loose Iesus vnto them, but they required Barrabas and obtained; their importunitie also preuailed with Pylate against Christ. The gouernour still at that feast, Was wont to giue a prisner free: He whom the people would request, Who so it were, the same was he. One Barrabas was prisoner, A verie theefe and murtherer. Then Pylate to the people sayd, Whom will ye that I do let loose? His libertie shall vndelayd Be granted him, whom ye do choose: If Christ, or Barrabas be he, Now name the man, he shall go free. For Pylate knew it verily, That enuie caused them indeed To deale with Christ so cruelly, And therefore sought to haue him freed. His wife also to that intent, A message had to Pylate sent. But the chiefe Priests and Elders bad The people that they should require, That Barrabas might free be had, And that none should for Christ desire. To this aduise with full intent, The people soone did yeeld consent. For when that Pylate did demand, Which of them both they would haue loose: They (as the high Priest did command) Barrabas the theefe did choose. Sith we (say they) this custome haue, Then Barrabas we all do craue. But Pylate willing to let go Christ Iesus, asked them againe; What will ye then that I should do With Iesus? and they answer'd plaine, And did request most instantly, That Pylate would him crucifie. He did the third time aske likewise, What was the euill Christ had done: I cannot see (though you surmise) A cause of death since you begon. Christ I will chastise and let go, If you consent to haue it so. But they more earnestly require, That he would Iesus crucifie. At last he granted their desire, Although it were vnwillingly: For when the people seemd to faile, The high Priests voyces did preuaile. When Pilate saw all he could do, Would not effect then his desire, But that it made the tumult mo, And that they did Christs death conspire: Their furie grew to such a rage, That nought but death could it asswage. Then Pilate washt his hands, and sayd, Most innocent I am indeed: Though you seeme not to be affrayd, To make this iust mans heart to bleed. His blood on vs and ours let be, If it offend, and none on thee. Christ Iesus was condemned and crucified. So Pilate willing them to please, Gaue sentence as they did require: He Barrabas did then release, And Iesus as they did desire He scourged, and deliuered Vnto them to be crucified. The souldiers led Christ away, And brought him to the common hall: Whereas the band without delay, Were gathered together all, To worke and do assuredly, To Christ all kind of villanie. They stripped him of all he had, And put on him a scarlet weed: A crowne of thornes which they had made, Set on his head, in hand a reede, And bowing knees, in mocking way, God saue thee king of Iewes, they say. And they did spit then in his face, With rods they smote him on the head, They were all cleane deuoyd of grace, They in their sinnes so wallowed: They practised what they could tho, That wrought, or might increase his wo. They tooke his robe from him away, And put his clothes on him againe: Then led him foorth without delay, No whit regarding all his paine. Some thought the time lost verely, They letted Christ to crucifie. As they out of the hall then came, They met a man that passed by. Simon of Cyren calld by name, Him they compelled certainly, The crosse of Christ with them to beare: Which the man did for verie feare. A multitude of people then, Did follow Christ the way he went, Aswell of women as of men, For him they all did much lament. Weepe not ye women so for me, But for your sonnes and selues, sayd he. The dayes will come when men shall say, Blessed are they that barren are: The paps that giue no sucke this day, And wombes that likewise neuer bare: For they shall wish the hils to fall, And so the mountaines, on them all. If they do this in the greene tree, What shall be done then in the dry? If thus they execute on me The depth of all their crueltie? What shall God to the wicked do? Consider it, and weepe no mo. Two euill doers likewise were, Then led with Christ for to be slaine, A iust reward they both did beare, Their euill deeds deserued paine. Yet Christ was vsd more spitefully Then they, for all their villany. From thence into the place they came, Which Golgotha they called then: Of dead mens sculs it had the name, For there they executed men: They also call'd it Caluarie, Where they did Iesus crucifie. Then vineger they mixt with gall, Or wine and myrrhe as other thinke: When Christ for drinke began to call, They offerd this for him to drinke. They had deuised it in vaine, He would not so be rid of paine. When Iesus thus did suffer death, Impatiencie in him was none, He sought no meanes to stop his breath, As he with feare were ouergone: But for vs died verily, As God appointed, patiently. And crucifi'd when Iesus was, Those euill doers likewise were So put to death, each in his place, On his right hand and left hand there. Christ Iesus suffred like a lambe, Not once repining at the same. But calling to his father, sayd, O father do thou them forgiue, Though they be not at all affrayd, Thy sonne with torments thus to grieue: And though my life they take away, That thou wilt blot their sinnes, I pray. His garments then they parted all, And did cast lots there for his coate, That he whose lot thereon would fall, Might sole enioy what he had got. This was almightie God his will, That they the Scriptures should fulfill. And all the people that stood by, Beheld and saw what there was done: The rulers also scornefully Sayd, if he be Gods chosen sonne, As vnto others health he gaue, So he himselfe now let him saue. A title Pilate also wrote, And put it vp the crosse vpon, Whereby each man might plainly note, What was then his opinion; Iesus of Nazareth to be King of the Iewes, confessed he. And though the high Priests did repine, That Pilate then should write him so: This sentence, sayd he, it is mine, It shall remaine will ye or no. In Hebrue, Greeke, and Latin he, Did cause the same so writ to be. All this while by his crosse did stand His mother, and her sister to, Marie Cleopas was at hand, And Marie Magdalene also. Though griefe did pierce them to the heart, They would not yet from Christ depart. Then Iesus to his mother sayd, And the Disciple standing by, Though they were both then all dismayd, To see Christ vsd so cruelly. Thy mother see, said he to th' one, And to the other, see thy sonne. And this Disciple was the same, That Christ did so entirely loue, Though Iohn doth here conceale his name: Yet dutie did so deeply moue His heart, that he obediently Christs hests performed faithfully. The wicked Iewes that passed by. Reuil'd at Christ, and wagd the head: The high Priest, Scribe and Pharisie, Continued so till Christ was dead; They mocking him from most to least, Till he was dead, did neuer rest. Thou that the Temple doest destroy, And build it in three dayes againe, Now saue thy selfe from all annoy, Why dost thou so here suffer paine? The sonne of God if that thou be, Come from the crosse, that we may see. Then of the euill doers one Began to raile on him also: If thou be Christ Gods onely sonne, Command that we from hence may go. Helpe now, sayd he, thy selfe and vs, That here do hang tormented thus. The other answered and sayd, Doest thou not feare the liuing God? Art not thou sinfull man dismayd, That feelest iustly of his rod? For we are punisht worthely, But this man vndeseruedly. Thus vnto Iesus then said he, When thou doest to thy kingdome come, I pray thee Lord remember me, And graunt me there with thee a roome. Then Iesus sayd, to thee I say, Thou shalt be there with me this day. From the sixt houre the ninth vnto, That day was darkned through the land: The sunne gaue then no shine also. The Iewes would not yet vnderstand, No, not though that the temple there, Renting, did put them all in feare. About the ninth houre Iesus sayd, Crying aloud as then likewise, My God why hast thou thus delayd, Or seem'st thy sonne so to despise? He seekes sayd some, that then stood by, Elias helpe assuredly. And other said, now let vs see, If that Elias will him saue. Then Iesus sayd, I thirst, giue me To coole my thirst some drinke, I craue: And said, all things are finished, As God the Lord hath promised. Mathew, Marke, as Iohn also Say, that some there that then stood by, With sponge and vineger did go, That they had filled hastily: And offred it vpon a reede, But Christ drunke not of it indeede. Then with a loud voyce Christ did crie, Into thy hands I do commend My spirit, now most hartily: O father deare, the same defend. And so he bowing downe the head, Gaue vp the ghost, and straight was dead. Then (as is sayd) the vaile did rent, Of their great Temple into twaine: From top to bottome it was splent, Which neuer could enclose againe; The earth did quake, and stones did riue, And graues did yeeld their dead aliue. And many Saints did rise and go, After his resurrection, Into the citie, to and fro, And made their apparition To many of the godly there, That of Gods wrath did stand in feare. When the Centurion that stood by, And they that were abiding there, Saw what did happen, certainly They fell into exceeding feare: Surely this man was iust, sayd he; And needs the sonne of God must be. The people that came to that sight, And did behold what things were done, Smiting their breasts, returned right, Confessing him to be Gods sonne. Of his acquaintance some did stay, But most were fled and gone away. The women boldly there did stay, And stood aloofe, and looked on: Though his Disciples fled away, These did behold his passion: For God would haue those weakelings there, Witnesse of such things for to beare. The Iewes because they did prepare That day, against the Sabboth day, As men that had exceeding care, Lest they offended any way: For that day was the chiefest feast Among the Iewes of all the rest. Now that the bodies might not be, Remaining on the crosse that day, They all together thus agree, To begge of Pilate, that they may Breake all their legges, and them downe take, Lest it should them polluted make. The Iewes they all did greatly feare, In outward things for to offend: Their Sabboth they obserued there, Religiously they did pretend; Yet spared nor most wilfully, To kill the guiltlesse cruelly. And now when leaue they gotten had, The souldiours did performe the deed: Both they and these were verie glad, That so they of their suite did speed: Therefore they first the theeues did take, And both their legs a sunder brake. And when they vnto Iesus went, And found him then already dead, His legs they brake not, as they ment, But then a souldiour opened His side so sweet with cruell speare, Which he in hand as then did beare. And there-out straightway issued, As bloud then water freshly both: He that saw when it happened, Doth witnesse it as verie troth, And knoweth that he here doth giue The truth, that you might it beleeue. All these things were so done in deed, That they the Scripture might fulfill: For God before had so decreed, And man could not resist his will. Whom they thrust thorough they shall see: His bones shall not one broken be. Christ was taken downe from the Crosse, enbalmed and buried by Ioseph of Arimathia and Nicodemus. When euen-tide was now at hand, That day of preparation, A night then kept throughout the land, With solemne obseruation: Their Sabboth then must haue no let, For it began when sunne was set. Then Ioseph came that was so iust, A noble counseller in deed; Which did in God repose his trust, And of his kingdome hop'd to speed. To those he did not giue consent, That Christ our Sauiour did torment. His worldly wealth was not a let, And banished be had all feare: His master he could not forget, That did for him such torments beare; Whose body Ioseph then was glad, To begge of Pylate: which he had. But Pilate maruell'd if he were Already dead, and sent to call The Captaine, witnesse for to beare, That had bene present there at all. And when he heard the truth, then he To Iosephs will did soone agree. Then Ioseph went to take away The body which he begged so: He would therein make no delay, But straight to take it downe would go. The feast drew on, Ioseph would haue Christ Iesus body layd in graue. And Nicodemus likewise came, Which a Disciple was also, Though secretly for feare of blame, This man with Ioseph then did go. Of mirrhe and aloës pure and rare, An hundred waight with him he bare. They both his bodie downe did take, And it in linnen cloths did lap: Ointments and odours they did make, Which with the bodie they did wrap. They buried him as maner then Was for to burie Noble-men. Christ in a sepulcher they lay, That Ioseph in a rocke did hew, Wherein no man vntill that day Was euer layd, this Ioseph knew, That had thereof the propertie, As Luke and Iohn do testifie. So when they had in solemne wise Interred Christ, ere they were gone, They did betweene them both deuise, To roll vnto the doore a stone: And then they did with heauie heart, From thence vnto their home depart. And Marie Magdalene did see, And so did Marie Ioses to, Where Christ in graue was laid to be; Then homeward both began to go, Oyntments and odours to prepare: They then of Christ (though dead) had care. Yet rested they the Sabboth day, Because of the commandement: Though they kept them from thence away, They caried still a full intent, When that the Sabboth had an end, To visit Christ their Lord and frend. Now that the Lord might manifest, Christ Iesus resurrection Vnto the Iewes, and all the rest, That were of the same faction: He caused them, to their great shame, To be the witnesse of the same. They spared not the sabboth day, To manifest their malice more: Their zeale was such they would not stay, Or rather raging as before, The high Priests, Scribes and all the rest, Assembled them vpon that feast. And so they vnto Pilate went, And humbly did desire his aide, Expressing wholly their intent, They in this maner to him sayd; Christ that deceiuer oft would say, I will from death rise the third day. Command the graue (we do pray thee) To be made sure, till that be past, Lest his disciples, which may be, Do steale him while those dayes do last: And to the people then do say, That Christ from death rose vp that day. So the last errour worse shall be, A great deale then the first hath beene. They raged yet as when that he Among them late aliue was seene. Ye haue a watch, said Pilate, go, And make it sure, do euen so. All hence they went then hastely, The sepulcher for to make fast: A watch prouided carefully, They seald the stone, this was the last. And this the Lord did so effect, To confound whom he had reiect. And to their sauing health likewise, Whom he had chosen long before. To thee therefore God onely wise, Be praise and thanks for euermore: One mightie God in persons three, All honor we do giue to thee. Amen. THE SIXTH AND LAST PART OF THE HISTORIE OF OVR LORD AND SAVIOVR IESUS Christ, as it is written by the Euangelistes, containing his resurrection from death, and his ascension to heauen. To the tune of the 81. Psalme. Christ rose from death the day after the Sabboth, called the Lords day: Marie Magdalene and others came to the sepulcher, and sawe a vision of Angels. Be light and glad, in God reioyce, Which is our strength and stay: Be ioyfull and lift vp your voyce, To Iacobs God alway: For he hath sent his sonne indeed, Our flesh on him to take, As he had long before decreed, For his great mercies sake. Which flesh in base and poore array, Christ clad him selfe withall, And in this flesh he tooke away The cause of all our fall. First, needs he must be perfect man, Sith man did first offend: And God also, who onely can So great a fault amend. Thus Christ as he appointed was, Both God and man in deed, Brought by his death that thing to passe, Which nothing else could speed. This Christ wrought our redemption, From deuill, death and hell: We haue by him saluation, As holy Scriptures tell. And when all men had lost this light, As farre as man could see: For darknesse is our sharpest sight, If faithlesse that we be: Yea then when all our hope was past, To see Christ Iesus slaine, Out of the graue God brought at last, Our sauing health againe. And to be witnesse of the same, And triumph ouer hell, (That flesh and bloud might to their shame. Consider of it well) The weakelings of the world he chose, Whom worldly men despise, For to confound the wits of those, That thought them worldly wise. I meane the rising vp againe, Of Iesus from the dead: Lest that our hope had bene in vaine, And we with fancies fed. For if the dead did not arise, Our hope were vaine, I say, And we as beasts should in that wise, Continue in the clay. But Christ the first fruits of the dead, Is risen vp in deed: As we the members of that head, Shall sure hereafter speed. And to stirre vp the slouthfull feare, That his Disciples had, Weake women did first witnesse beare, Of that which made vs glad. They when the Sabboth day was past, Or while it did endure, Deuised how they might at last, With oyntments sweet and pure, Enbalme Christs body in the graue: Therefore at Sabboths end, Odours and oyntments sweet they haue, To worke what they intend. With them the Sabboth day was done, Assoone as sunne was set: And then the women all begon, (For nothing then did let) Their oyntments sweet for to prepare: And this they did by night, That they might be (this was their care) There by the day was light. Then Mary Magdalen by name, And Mary Solom to, Were they which thus together came, With other women mo: And as they went all by the way, This doubt did then arise, The stone to roll the women say, We cannot all deuise. Yet to the sepulcher they go, The first day of the weeke: Where they at sunne appearing so Found that which they did seeke: I meane when they came to the place, Behold the stone was gone: Gods Angell shewed them this grace, To roll away the stone. Whose face did shine like lightening, His garments white as snow: Which vnto them in the dawning, These ioyfull newes did show: How from the dead Christ risen was; But they amazed were, To see such things come so to passe, Did put them in great feare. The earthquake first, and then that sight, Vnusd of them to see, Did make the women all affright, And wish at home to be. And sure no maruell, fith also The watch was fraught with feare, Not able once to moue or go, They so astonied were. When Marie saw the stone away, She went thence home with speed, To Simon Peter where he lay, To shew him of the deed. And to the rest, for this she thought, From graue the bodie they, (Which we with teares and sorow sought) By night did sure conuey. Then Peter went with Iohn away, To see what they had done: They would no longer make delay, But both together runne; Yet this Disciple him out went, And Peter left behind, Though both did runne with full intent The truth thereof to find. When Iohn vnto the graue did come, He stouped downe to see, Supposed as it is of some, If Christ therein might be; But he went not into the caue Till Simon Peter came, Who stepped first into the graue, To see and search the same. Who there did find the linnen lye, And kerchiefe of his head: Not with the linnen, but set by, Wrapt in another stead. Then went the other in also, That first came to the place: And both saw and beleeued tho, God giuing both such grace. For they did not well vnderstand, That Christ should rise indeed, Till then: so they thence out of hand, Returned home with speed: Nor did they see, or heare, as then, More then the emptie graue: Christ surely had not chosen men, First sight of him to haue. But Mary would not so depart, Nor leaue his graue as yet: She felt such sorow in her heart, She could him forget. But wept, and wayled verie sore, Which she did not in vaine; She was first witnesse made therefore, That Christ did rise againe. The women they did not depart, Their minds were wholy set To find Christ, though they suffred smart, Nothing the same could let: Wherefore to comfort them againe, God downe his Angels sent, Who heareth his when they complaine, Effecting their intent. Which Angels to the women sayd, Why do ye weepe and wayle? Plucke vp your hearts, be not affrayd, Ye haue no cause to quayle: Iesus that late was crucified, In graue you looke to find: Sith the Scripture is verified, Then be not of that mind. Christ is not here, but risen is, Aliue in deed is he: And that ye may be sure of this, Come to his graue and see: What God before appointed had, Christ Iesus did fulfill: Thereby to make his chosen glad, And to obey Gods will. Christ spake to you before of this, If ye remember well, While he in Galilie iwis, Did there among you dwell: The sonne of man deliuered, To sinfull men must be, Sayd Christ, for to be crucified; Yet rise againe will he. Then they these words remembered, Though they were all affrayd: And knew that he had suffered, As he before had sayd. Thus were the women comforted, And eased of their feare: And of Christs rising answered, While they were weeping there. And sent home hastily with care, His resurrection To his Disciples to declare With expedition Which three things afterward againe, Christ did to them, I say: He easd their feare: they saw him plaine: He sent them backe away. But Christ to Mary Magdalen Did first of all appeare, While she was weeping, euen then At his sepulcher there: And when she bowed downe to see, And looke the graue into, Of Angels there she found to be (As Iohn reporteth) two. Which both, where Iesus body lay Were sitting in the graue: And thus they vnto Mary say, What seekest thou to haue? Why weepest thou? she sayd againe, My Lord is stolne away: Because I know not (I complaine) Where they my Lord did lay. When Mary thus to them had sayd, She turning backe might see Christ standing by, yet all dismayd Christ knew him not to be. Christ sayd, why weep'st thou? she did say Sir, if thou bore him hence: Now tell me where thou didst him lay, And I will fetch him thence. All this while she thought Christ to be I he gardiner in deed: But when by name Christ called, she Did turne about with speed: And with her body turn'd her mind, Thus did effect his call: For she which hitherto as blind Perceiud him not at all, Confessing now, doth answer so That he her master is, Whom she as gardner spake vnto, And doth reioyse at this. This Mary (Marke faith) Christ made free, When she had then at least Seu'n deuils in her; wherewith saith he, This woman was possest. But touch not me, did Iesus say, That I am not ascended, Thou doest beleeue: this errour may And must by faith be moued. Leaue thou to looke as dead for me, I liue assuredly; And now to touch me, learne to flie By faith aboue the skie. And to my brethren, say thou so, To them I do thee send: To my father and yours, I go, To God I do ascend. Which was to lift their earthly mind, To looke for whom we loue, No more in earthy graue to find, But now in heau'n aboue. Christ appeared to the women as they went backe from the graue, after they had seene the Angels, which told them of Christs resurrection. Then next, while that the women went All homeward in the way: For backe the Angels had them sent To tell these newes: I say Christ Iesus did to them appeare, Mathew doth restifie: They worshipp'd him with reu'rence there Embracing ioyfully. To whom, what both the Angels sayd, Christ did confirme againe: Plucke vp your hearts, be not affrayd, You sorow all in vaine. Go bid my brethren, this sayd he, They go to Galilie: For me (as you haue) must they see, And shall do speedily. So thence, they went as charge they had, (No feare did them annoy) All his Disciples to make glad, Who thought it but a toy: For all the women did report, They would it not beleeue, No comfort, could with them consort, Christs death so did them grieue. The souldiours signified to the high Priests what was done, and they were corrupted with money by them. When they were gone, the watchmen came The Citie then vnto, And told the high Priests all the same, Which knew not what to do, So mad they were, that their deuise, Did not effect in deed: Together they therefore their wise To counsell call'd with speed. Wherein they did with one consent, Among themselues agree, The watch with money to content, They spared for no fee: Nor yet the watch did force to lye, When they the money had; The high Priests hir'd them easily, And each of them was glad. The Iewes that they had so obtaind The watch to worke their will: The watch that they so much had gaind, They cared not how ill. So both were pleasd, but marke the end, What was it they should do? The watch must lye, and they defend, It was concluded so. The lye was this, that Christ from graue Was stolne away by night, And his Disciples surely haue Now hid him out of sight. When was it done? while we were all By heauie sleepe opprest: And when we thought: that great and small, Had likewise bene at rest. If they then slept, how did they see, When he was stolne away? And his Disciples knew to be, That did him thence conuay? Or why did they (being armed men) Not seeme for to resist Those weakelings, without weapons then? Too late comes had I wist. If theeues had stolne the bodie thence, They had not left behind The linnen clothes, the recompence That they were there to find. If friends, the shame to see him bare, Had causd them this to do: As of the bodie to haue care, To take the linnen to. Yet they vpon presumption, And promise to them made, By the high Priests persuasion, Set vp their lying trade: For when they knew they should go free, And fall to no disgrace, Although the gouernour did see, That they did lye apace, They spread abrode this false report, Which no way can be so: That his disciples did resort By night his graue vnto, And had Christs bodie stolne away, To make men thinke that he, As he before (aliue) did say In three dayes will I be. And this among the Iewes is sayd Vnto this verie day, (For they are not at all affrayd) That he was stolne away. By Pilates winking came to passe, That this escaped tho: He (as the high Priests) blinded was, For God would haue it so. The high Priests did the Gouernour Perswade; he was content; The watch men had their hire therefore, And so away were sent. And being gone, they spread this fame, That Christ was stolne away: Which sure the Iewes do to their shame, Beleeue vnto this day. Christ appeared to Peter. Christ first to Marie did appeare, To comfort sinners all, Then to the other women there, To answer Euahs fall. And thirdly vnto Peter he Did shew him selfe also, From former feare to set him free: For Christ did see his wo. Of the two Disciples that went to Emaus, and what happened to them by the way. Of the Disciples, the same day, As two to Emaus went, (This from Ierusalem then lay, As writers do consent, Threescore furlongs; or foorthright As we accompt do take, Seu'n miles and one halfe mile we might, Of the same furlongs make. This Nicopolis since we name, The Romains cald it so: It was a towne sometimes of fame, And very pleasant tho.) They talked both of what was done As well to Christ before He dy'd, as this, which now begonne For to amaze them more. For they had heard the women tell, That Christ rose vp againe, And was aliue; yet knew not well, Which they should do of twaine: Beleeue, or not: or what to do, For all men saw him die: But women onely, say these two, These newes do testifie. And as they thus then reasoned, Behold it came to passe, That Christ him selfe as happened, Or purposely it was, Did ioyne him selfe in iourney wise, With those Disciples then, And sayd, what do ye thus deuise, And looke as wofull men? Yet all this while their eyes were hold, They could not both perceiue What man he was, that was so bold, Though they did him receiue Most willingly to walke the way, And trauell with them to, As may appeare by what they say, As they together go. Art thou, said Cleopas, (my friend) A stranger onely here? And if thou be, a while attend, And giue vnto me eare: For at Ierusalem of late The thing hath happened, That we so much do wonder at, Was thus determined. Then Iesus sayd, what things were those? They sayd to him againe, The thing that we do now disclose, A number do disdaine. Iesus of Nazaret was this, A Prophet mightely In word and deed, allowd iwis Of God and man lately. Him the high Priests and rulers all, Deliuered to be Condemned in their iudgement hall: And crucifi'd was he. But we did hope, that he would sure Deliuer Israell: Tis since he did his death endure, Three dayes, we know it well. And certaine women that we haue Among vs, verely Astonied vs: for at his graue Where they were certainly, Though they there found his bodie gone, They did returne and say, Of Angels that a vision They saw this very day. Which sayd, that Christ did liue indeed: So that on this report, Some of vs did with hast and speed, Vnto the graue resort. And they did find apparantly, All as the women sayd, But saw not him assuredly, Which made vs all dismayd. O fooles, said Christ, and verie slow Of heart, for to conceiue: What hath bene sayd, do ye not know? Or will ye not perceiue? The Prophets all haue this foretold, That Christ should suffer so, Then to his glorie enter should, And to his Father go. And he at Moses then began, And the Prophets by name, Interpreting from man to man, Their sayings of the same: And all their writings left behind Of Christ, from first to last, He then imprinted in their mind, And would from them haue past. For to the towne they did draw neare, Whereto as then they went: He seemed, not to tarie there, So trying their intent. But they constraining him, did say, Abide with vs all night; Farre spent alreadie is the day, And now the towne in sight. So he went in to take his rest, Whereof they both were glad, And then to supper them addrest, Content with what they had. He sitting downe, the bread did take, And when they both did see, He first gaue thankes, and then it brake, They knew him Christ to be. For both their eyes were opened, And they did know him well: But marke what after happened, For thus it then befell, While they with ioy surprized were, He went out of their sight, And left them both abiding there, To take their rest all night. Herein we may assuredly, Perceiue Christ Iesus vse, And learne to eate meate thankfully, Lest we the same abuse. Christ vsing now his wont before, In breaking bread to pray, Did lighten them, that verie sore Were blinded by the way. And yet againe twixt ioy and feare, They were amazed so, They could not see how from them there, He then away did go. Not that he did his shape at all Exchange, as some men say: But from this earth their minds to call, On heau'nly things to lay. For now no more on earth is he, As he before hath bin As mortall man, so found to be In all, excepting sinne: But sitteth sure in heau'n aboue, Now in great maiestie, His Father for vs still to moue, And worke our libertie. Then they betweene them selues did say, Did not our hearts reioyce, While he talkt with vs by the way, And while we heard his voyce? Our hearts did burne, while we heard how He op'ned more and more The Scriptures vnto vs, so slow To marke the same before. And in that houre they rose againe, And did returne with speed: They letted not for anie paine, They went backe both indeed: Vnto Ierusalem they hie, Where the Apostles were: For they did there together lye, Amazed much with feare. Whom when they found, they ioyfully Began for to report, How by the way most happily, Christ did to them resort. Yet ere they came the newes was spread That Simon Peter he Had likewise surely lately sped, Of Christ a sight to see. While these confest what he had done, And told them by the way, And how to know him they begonne, By breaking bread that day: Iesus stood in the midst, and sayd, Peace be vnto you all: It is my selfe, be not affrayd, Perceiue it well you shall. This was that verie day at night, That he did first arise, That Christ appeared in their sight, While closely in this wise They shut them in a secret place: The Iewes they feared so, That they durst not be seene a space, Abrode the streetes to go. He while the doores all close were kept, And they of him did talke, Into the midst of them then stept, He made no longer walke. Christ shewed his diuinitie Herein, we must confesse; Yet left not his humanitie, For he meant nothing lesse. Nor did he pierce the doores indeed, As foolish Papists hold: For so to do he had no need, That could do what he would. If barres or bands and iron gate, Gaue Peter leaue to go, Why wonder ye so much thereat, If these did euen so? And that no fayned shape he had, As ghosts or spirits haue, To ease their feare, and make them glad, His hands and feete he gaue That they should handle them and see That he had flesh and bone: And not as spirits wont to be, For they haue neither none. Therefore set care and feare aside, These troubles that arise, You may out of your hearts let slide, And them as toyes despise. The bodie that was layd in graue, Now glorifi'd they see, And to their handling subiect haue, So good a God is he. Lo, thus did Christ to his appeare, Such as sought him indeed: At eu'rie time and tide his eare, Was open to their need. The morning Marie did him see, The women towards noone; To Peter next appeared he, And these ere day was done. To the Disciples late at night Appeared Christ also: Great comfort had they of that sight, And so had many moe. But while for ioy they did not yet Beleeue that it was he, Their blindnesse did them so much let, That then they could not see. Christ did againe vnto them say, Peace be vnto you all: As me my Father, so I may, And do you to me call, To be sent foorth, as I was sent To do my Fathers will: The which you must with good intent, As I haue, all fulfill. He breathed then on them, and sayd, Receiue the holy Ghost: And so gaue them such heau'nly ayd, As might releeue them most. Whose sinnes ye do remit, they are Remitted, then said he; Whose sinnes retained ye declare, Retained shall they be. And while they wondred yet, he sayd, Haue ye here anie meate? A peece of broyled fish they layd Before him for to eate, And of an honie combe a peece: Which meate then surely he Did take and eate, that he by these, Might shew him man to be. Then sayd he vnto them againe, These are the words I spake, When as I did with you remaine, And here abiding make: Fulfilled needes must all things be, Which by the Prophets were, As also Moses writ of me, As in the Law ye heare. And he their vnderstanding then Did open, that they might See what was sayd by holy men, And know the Scriptures right. Thus it is writ, thus behoued Christ Iesus for to die, And rise againe so from the dead, The third day verily. And that of sinnes remission, And eke repentance should Be preached to each nation, As hath before bene told; And that in Christs name alonely, Which here should first begin: For his name is assuredly, The onely salue for sinne. Now ye of these things witnesse are, Which happened to me: Therefore see you your selues prepare, And alwayes readie be. The promise that my Father made, You shall receiue indeed: The same Ile send to make you glad, Assure your selues with speed. Therefore when I depart you fro, See that you tarrie still Here in this Citie; for I go To do my Fathers will. In his good time he from on hie Will to you power giue, To preach abrode this mysterie, That many may beleeue. Christ the eight day after appeared to them againe, Thomas himselfe being then present. But Thomas was not with them there, Which of the twelue was one, When Iesus did to them appeare, For he from thence was gone. And the Disciples to him sayd, When he was come againe; We saw the Lord while hence ye stayd, And did abrode remaine. Except in his hands I do see The print of eu'ry naile, And put my finger there, sayd he, Your words will not preuaile, Except also into his side, My hand that I may thrust: Your newes from reason are so wide, That them I will not trust. Now eight dayes after Christ had bene With his Disciples there, He thus againe was likewise seene, Vnto them to appeare: And that while Thomas was within, The doores then shut withall: To stirre vp Thomas from his sinne, And raise him from his fall. Christ came, and in the midst he stood, Peace be to you, he said: Come hither Thomas, for thy good I come, be not affrayd. Put in thy fingers here, and see My hands and side also: They beare their marks, now faithfull be, And let this weaknesse go. Then Thomas answered and sayd, My Lord my God art thou. Thomas said he, be not dismayd: Because thou seest me now Thou dost beleeue: blessed I say Are they that haue not seene, And haue beleeued without nay, As I with them had beene. And many other things did he, More then are written here: And his Disciples witnesse be, That dayly with him were. But this is written that ye might Beleeue that Iesus is That Christ the sonne of God, whose right Is to giue life to his. Christ appeared to Iames. And Iames another time did see Christ, Paule doth it declare: Whereof we may assured be, For Christ of his had care; And as to Peter, so alone He vnto Iames then came. Thus did they see him euery one, And witnessed the same. Christ appeared to seuen of the Disciples as they were fishing at the sea of Tiberias. After these things Iesus also Did shew him selfe againe, To his Disciples, seuen or mo, Where then they did remaine, At the sea of Tiberias: For they a fishing were. And thus as then it came to passe, That they were fishing there. These were together in one place, And Simon Peter sayd, Ile go a fishing for a space, To whom they promise ayd: For they sayd, we will go with thee, And so away they went; Soone shipt they were as they would be, Small time therein was spent. But they that night their labour lost, Christ Iesus was away: They tooke no fish along the coast All night, till it was day. That Christ came vnto them, and then When he was come indeed, Though past all hope (as wearie men) Yet presently they speed. For when it was now early day, Christ on the shore did stand: They knew him not (as Iohn doth say) Though they were neare at hand. Haue ye sayd Christ, sirs anie meate? They answered him, no. Christ doth not his at all forget, Where euer that they go. Cast out your net, and you shall find On the right side, said he: So they obeyed Iesus mind, And cast that side, to see; Their trauels past was then no let, They did what Christ them bad: They scarse could draw to land the net, Such store of fish they had. Then that Disciple whom Christ lou'd, Said vnto Peter, lo, It is the Lord: his heart was mou'd, His mind did giue him so. When Peter heard that it was he, He girt his coate in hast, And cast him selfe to swimme, to see He would not be the last. But all the rest by ship did come, They were not farre from land: For as it is supposd of some, The shore was hard at hand. Two hundreth cubits off they were, Or thereabouts, they say: The net they drawing with them there, Made to the shore away. Assoone as they were come to land, A fire of coles they see: And Iesus by the same did stand, There bread and fish had he. The fish vpon the coales were layd, That Iesus had before: Bring of your fish also, he sayd; Thereof they had great store. Then Peter stept, to draw straightway The net and fish to land: His maisters mind he did obay, He readie was at hand. And hundreth, fiftie, then and three Of fishes great they had: Their net vnbroken safe they see, For all they were so lade. Come now and dine, then Iesus sayd. Of the Disciples none Durst aske, who art thou? so affrayd They were at what was done: And eke withall they knew it well, Him Christ the Lord to be: No man had neede the same to tell, They knew all it was he. Iesus tooke bread, and fish likewise, And to them did it giue, And they did eate what did suffise, Thus Christ did his releeue. This was the eight time since he rose, Christ did to them appeare: To some Disciples, as to those, That met together there. Christ restored Peter to his former place, thrise calling him, to answer his three fold deniall of him. Christ sayd when they had dined well, And each of them at ease; Simon thou sonne of Ionah tell, Lou'st thou me more then these? I loue thee Lord, thou knowst I do. My lambs (said Christ) then feed. Iesus the second time said so: He sayd, I do indeed. Then feed my sheepe, Christ Iesus sayd. Yet once againe did he Aske Peter; which made him dismayd, So instant him to see. Yea Peter grieu'd in heart to heare Christ aske him thrise the same; It doth to thee (ô Lord) appeare, That I do loue thy name. Then feed my sheepe, sayd Christ againe; So to his former place Christ called him, by this tis plaine, And he receiued grace. He did his maister thrise denie, So grieuous was his fall: And thrise to ease his miserie, Christ Iesus did him call. Amen, amen, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thy way Was where thou wouldest then, as free To walke at will each day. When thou art old, another shall Gird and leade thee also, Where thou wouldst not haue gone at all, Yet mayst not chuse but go. And this Christ vnto Peter spake, To signifie thereby, What death or end Simon should make, His God to glorifie. And when to him he had said this, Christ said then; follow me: That now his calling certaine is, Assured well is he. He turning backe did soone espie Him whom the Lord did loue, Then following after; verely He Christ for him did moue: (For this had leaned on Christs breast, As he at supper sate, And asked Christ then for the rest, Who should betray his state.) When Peter therefore saw him so, To Iesus he did say; Lord, what is it that he shall do? Now tell me I thee pray. Then Iesus said to him againe; Man, what is it to thee, If till I come he do remaine? See thou, thou follow me. Then went this word among them all, That that man should not die. Christ said not vnto him, he shall Not die assuredly, But if vntill I come, I will That tarie still shall he, Do thou what I command fulfill: What is the same to thee? Christ appearing to his Disciples, reproued their infidelitie. The ninth time that Christ did appeare, Of incredulitie He did reproue all that were there. Through imbecillitie They did misdoubt though they did see, And speake to him withall. Thus blind (as they) our eyes now be, Till Christ them open shall. Christ appeared to his Disciples and fiue hundred brethren at once in a mountaine in Galilie. The next time was in Galilie, Vpon a mountaine there: Where he as Paule doth testifie, To many did appeare. There vnto his a charge he gaue, The which to vndertake, He promisd them a helpe to haue, Which should them able make. For Iesus spake, and thus did say, All power now I haue, In heau'n and earth, and euerie way, Which God the Father gaue. Go ye therefore now teaching all, Baptizing them also: Throughout the world where I shall call, And you oppoint to go. Baptize all in the Fathers name, The Sonne, and holy Ghost: What I command, do ye the same, Your labour is not lost. Teach them all things for to obserue, That I command indeed: I am with you, you Ile preserue, And still releeue your need. I will saue them that shall beleeue, And be baptized to: My Father did me power giue, That I the same may do. The vnbeleeuers all shall be Condemned for the same. And these things also do shall he, Which shall beleeue my name. The deuils cast out in my name shall, With new toungs speake shall they: No deadly drinks shall hurt at all, And serpents take away. On sicke men if their hands they lay, They shall recouer well. All these things they shall day by day Performe, as I do tell. Christ appeared againe to th? in Bethanie, and led them into mount Oliuet, where after he had blessed them, he ascended most gloriously into heauen in their sight. Then the Disciples all they were By Iesus led away, To Bethanie together there, On his ascension day: And to mount Oliuet they went, Where he did blesse them all, Willing them then (as they were sent) All his elect to call. When he had blessed them, foorthright, While they beheld the same, A cloud tooke him vp out of sight, Which sodainly so came. And while they looked stedfastly To heau'nward as he went, Behold two men did stand them by, Perceiuing their intent. Which sayd to them, why gaze ye so, Ye men of Galilie? This Iesus whom ye see thus go, Shall so come verily, Those men in white apparell were, Whom they knew not as then Angels to be, that did appeare As though they had bene men. Which when they heard, they eu'rie where Went preaching day by day, The Lord increasing here and there, His Church, by them, I say: And eke confirming what they taught, With signes and wonders so, That still some fish their net then caught, Where euer they did go. Thus Iesus was seene bodily, ,In fortie dayes we reade, Eleuen times assurely, When he rose from the dead. And after his ascension, Christ also was seene twice: By Steuen when they did him stone, And by Saint Paule likewise. First Steuen vpon Gods right hand Did see him sit on hie, The which to them that there did stand, He then did testifie. Paule persecuting sore of such As did in Christ beleeue, Saw him, reioycing verie much, That God did grace him geue. And many other things there are, That Iesus did also, Which man with tong cannot declare, Nor pen paint out: for lo If written were his works and words, The world could not containe The bookes (so much the same affoords) Vnwritten that remaine. Yet herein is so much containd, As we haue need to know: Gods spirit sure in them remaind, That this to vs could shew; Therefore be glad, in God reioyce, That left vs such a stay: Be ioyfull, and lift vp your voyce, To Iacobs God alway. To Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, All glorie be therefore, That was and is of might the most, And shall be euermore. Amen. FINIS.</field>
