      <field name="fulltext">ADVENTURES OF ULYSSES BOOK THE FIRST THE ARGUMENT How great Ulysses, in the cave Of danger most extreme, Exposed his wisdom and did brave The one-eyed Polypheme. Ulysses' hopes and toils and woes,— His wanderings from first to close,— Inspire me, Muse! that I may say, Or sing, in a prevailing way. We all know how his martial skill Baffled the Trojan horse until At Appomattox they gave in,— Both horse and man. I would begin My lay what time he, taking rest With King Alcineus, his request Attending, did to him relate The story of his after fate. The King and he had duly dined; Fed well, and, being fully wined, Retired to Ulysses' private room, To taste tobacco's best perfume. Coarse portraits hanging round the walls, All in due order of their stalls, Of his choice friends, preferr'd as stable,— First-brand Havanas on the table, And lackey waiting at the door, In case his Highness rang for more,— United Royalty were sat; And after sandwiching their chat With monologues of that and this, King Alcineus of Wise Ulyss' Inquired, desirous of a view Of the perils that he had gone through, Et cetera. The Wise-in-speech Drew demijohn within his reach— But start, Muse! without more demur. How sweet (Ulysses loquitur) The products of a peaceful reign! The well-fill'd White House and the gain Of fat revenues, frequent feast, And drink, and smoke; and, not the least Of royal joys, but president, The knowing such things permanent! O King Alcineus! thou art blest: But I—I'm but a brief-term guest, Scarce saddled on my regal right; And poor my record. Small delight My tale can give thy kingly mind. We sail'd from Ilion. The wind, Fair for our voyage, full quickly bore Our vessel to the Shycoons' shore, Where, anchoring in Samana's Bay, We hoped to make an easy prey; But were repulsed,—it boots not how: So weigh'd, and set our craft with prow Toward the Lotophagian Isle. The Gods themselves take many a smile To that enchanting land, whose Lars Welcome all strangers, and great jars Crooked and deep and brimm'd with juice Hold to the thirsty-lipp'd. Long use Had we of that nectareous food, And ever found the taste more good, More tasteful, and with full content Were minded so our lives to 've spent; But Fate, that overrules design, Drove us again across the brine, And flung us, in unlucky hour, Among the Cyclops, who devour Those victims stranded on their coast. Haled there, I know not why, but toss'd By treacherous waves, their dark domain We invade, scarce to escape again. There wandering loosely to and fro, We chanced unwittingly to go Into, as one goes to his grave, The Cyclop Polyphemus' cave; And hardly had we time to hide I' the cupboard, when the wretch, left-eyed, With close-wrapp'd bandage o'er the right, Round prying with unequal sight, Beheld us. Of my comrades two He seized; and straight his wide maw knew Their bodies, living there in-thrown, Quick-crunch'd, as hound might crunch a bone. Grimly he grinn'd, and turn'd agape Myself-ward. “Let no man escape!” I craftily exclaim'd, with thought By ready guile to bring to naught His greedier will. For if one word Assenting fell from him, that cord Would bind his after acts and fix My safety, as if sworn by Sticks: For I myself call'd by that name Of No-man. But my little game Of bluff was useless, and no sound Articulate for answer found, But noise of ruminance. Unsate, Two more he lifted. One he ate; Th' other, the purser of my ship And captain's clerk, gave him the slip. For while the One-eyed smiling lingers, Licking the warm blood from his fingers, He drops out from the mess of gore, And in the letter-hole o' the door Squeezes himself with lucky wit. He got him pass'd adown the slit; And I, though thicker, would have crept Through also, but the monster slept After his gorge; so I design'd The means to make my enemy blind, With handy spear-point in his eye: And then myself and friends would fly. But we were barr'd in, the door shut And bolted, and we could not put The bolt back; and so kept “to hum,” The while he snored we drank his rum, Until— And here Alcineus too Was snoring, and so never knew, Unless he learn'd it in a dream, How wise Ulyss' baulk'd Polypheme. BOOK THE SECOND THE ARGUMENT To raise the wind with Æolus Sufficient pains he takes; Brings Circè home to Shame's White House, And pleasant dalliance makes. What man can tell, when first he stoops To drink and hides within the hoops Of whiskey-barrels, of his end? Fleeting the pleasure drink can lend Heroic souls; and sensual greed (This Henry Ward would own indeed) Is pledged to Ruin. Sad the count Of Icaries intent to mount, Who wax and wane because unwean'd From Mamma Bourbon! How he lean'd And toppled over, and so fell! Of one such I have now to tell; Or he with his own voice may speak, Hoarse, but emphatic. Many a week (Ulysses said, between the smoke And grog. For King Alcineus woke That night he heard of Polypheme; And the next night Ulyss' his theme Resumed),—for many a week we dared Not think o' the Cyclops, so through-scared. But I must tell you of the fun I had with Circè. She was one Of quite a different brand, you bet! And happy man he who can get A place with her. Well, we had struck Her isle; and had the wit or luck To please her goddessship. Her house Stood in a vale, conspicuous With marble pillars, and all white; And a broad avenue led forthright To the fore-court. At farther end O' the avenue Dame Circè penn'd Her farming stock, in which great joy She had. And many a pretty boy And old-'nough-to-know-better man Pigg'd there: you know the story ran Of many lovers she seduced, Whom when they gat them to their roost She changed to beasts, and kept them so. We'd heard so much, but did not know The whole truth until we lodged there. Not that the truth gave us much care. Enough, that at her palace gate She never let her suitors wait; And we were hungry, and right prompt To be her guests without accompt. Elected, seated, and much fed, We liked her full-blown lustyhed, Approved her cates, and in her wine Pledged her, as queenly as divine; Feasting without compunctious heed Of what might be the sort of feed The Witch provided. Day by day Reclined before her board we lay; And day by day I found my crew Growing more beast-like. Just a few Retain'd awhile a manly shape; But one was changing to an ape; One's nose poked out, a red-hair'd fox; One wore the dewlap of an ox; One 'gan to neigh in horsey slang; More bray'd; and one with nasal twang Was preacher-monkey; one took guise Of wolf, with tusks and cruel eyes; Some doggedly would bark whene'er An honest man, by chance, pass'd there; And some, their human form divine Scarce worsen'd, were becoming swine,— So like to hogs at their first start, The face but more express'd the heart. One was n't anything but fish. Him I loved well, and at my wish The Goddess kept him for her Fool— Myself, in a small stagnant pool Within the White House garden space. 'T was droll to see his fishy face And watch his upturn'd watery eyes Agaze for Spanish liquorice, With which we fed him, I and she: For she would make great court to me, Treating me like an equal king: Nor would deny me anything. So change went on in all beside Ulysses: Circè was his bride. Day after day I miss'd a friend, And sometimes I would go or send Down to the Farm; and sure enough There were they. They would whine and snuff About me, crawling on all fours, Like lobbyists at Congress doors, With supplications piteous, Knowing me. What of Æolus? (Alcineus ask'd.) The Windy Lord Found means that help'd us Circè-ward (Replied the Wise King); we had bags He gave, fill'd with, not filthy rags, But gold and silver, which at first He grudged not; but wind-bags will burst; And one Black Friday—Corbyn knows. But we'll not talk of that. Where goes The money? Thunder!! who can tell, Or whence it comes? You might as well Ask Kilbourne. We have had, be sure! Enough to battle and endure. The great Wind-Raiser is not kind Always; times bearish; when the wind Sank we took whiskey. Guess our grief, Our pains! Imagine some mean thief Who past the household, all abed And thoughtless, creeps with stealthy tread, Mask'd, fearful! Why, in time of war I sent my foragers afar In the face of day, and laid bold hand On what I would: my one command Was law enough. And now my doom— To skulk like maggot in a tomb, And seek in darkness and in dread, By crooked paths untrack'd instead Of martial prowess, what I want. I never was much given to vaunt,— A silent man, and close, and wise,— But never had I, for supplies, In all the years of that great war Such difficulty as I bore For Circè's sake.—Return to her, And Æolus be blow'd! Ah, Sir! For over seven years I remain'd Her slave; and would that I were chain'd To the same oar for another term! Large as her cup is, I'd not squirm, But drain it to the veriest dregs. It never fetch'd me off my legs: Though 't may be my supporters shook Returning from the walks I took, Before reported, to the Styes. But—Steady! said I; and my eyes Straight kept, though times the avenue Seem'd turning a little crooked too. But no one noticed such things there. Well, Circè acted on the square With me; but yet, however charm'd, Thoughts of a possible change alarm'd; So trepidating, I besought The God of thievish craft, and brought Him gifts, intreating his advice How to evade the precipice Tow'rd which, like the Pigs in Holy Writ, I edged, on Circè's throne to sit. A potent herb he gave to me To mollify her sorcery: “This,” said he, “in your usual cup, Bed-time!” I mix'd and drank it up. That night, as in her lap I lay Caress'd, pretending to obey The stealthy whispering of Sleep, I felt like—struck all of a heap, To see her alter'd countenance: Ugly! Her right arm did advance Toward her wand, set idly by (I kept the pig-look in my eye, Watchful): she raised and waved it thrice, Muttering,—“I think that may suffice”; Then loud, in voice that sounded strange,— “Thou Beast!” I wink'd, and did not change. You'd think that after this, perhaps, There 'd be no more of lying in laps, Of my Corruption. Savage! you Know naught of what the Civilized do. I liked her,—she, when she 'd to find Ulysses held a constant mind, Did as all prudent women know Is best, when two in the same boat row: Work'd her one scull in time with mine; And taught me all her art divine, And latest craft. 'T was then she said,— 'T were wise, ere I were really dead, To learn the secret of the grave, My future doom, if I dared brave That simmering cauldron, Tartarus. What dared I not, both curious And for gain' sake? Another night Shall tell you of the ghostly sight, And all the history of the event. (They took another drink, and went.) BOOK THE THIRD THE ARGUMENT The merry Goddess bids him go Visit his friends in Hell: He goes, sees them; what things they show,— Some past, some they foretell. Again the King and President Are sandwich'd, with the pleasant scent Of smoke between; nor that alone, But on the board the best Bourbon St. Louis spins. Alcineus nods T' Ulyss', then thinking of the odds, Who rubs his nose and, winking slow, Picks up his parable. That 's so! Was it a dream, or not? Methought I went there where the souls are brought Of heroes buried and unburied; Then, o'er the stream by Charon ferried, I pass'd the Triple-headed Dog. Three heads—three terms—I said: the fog Got in my head. When I recover'd I stood among the crowd that hover'd Alongside Acheron,—not yet damn'd, Nor yet Elysian,—somewhat jamm'd, So many of the first who tried To shake hands ere I stept inside: Post-traders, other 'custom'd thieves, Shame-swallowers from the White House eaves, Dealers in seal-skins from Alaska, 'Frisco distillers; it would task a Life to catalogue the lot Of patriot parasites. God wot, More vermin Ercles had not won By small-tooth-combing Washington, The District given in,—the whole At Babcock measure, free from toll! They hustled me, pull'd me about, And would perforce have kept me out In spite of all my force of will, So popular I found me still; Nay! rather with me 'd enter Hell Than lose my friendly last farewell. But I had business in view, So shied affection, and broke through. To speak of Tartarus, breadth and length, 'S beyond my conversational strength: Enough, 't was crowded too, and hot, Unpleasantly; I soon had got Over the fence into the Fields, But a close row of red-hot shields, With regular red-hot spears above, Hotly forbade that cool remove. And else 't was from the souls in bale That I must learn what might avail For future guidance. So I stay'd, As coolly as I could, afraid But imperturbable, my wont; And stolidly set my face t' affront The worst of Hell, the worst too thin To outstare me. How shall I begin My tale o' the immaterial hosts, Not dim but bodiless, of ghosts— Like forms of paraffine full-blown In a way to mediums not unknown— Meeting my sight,—mere bubbles, all Transparent, hypocritical? I rank them only as they burst Upon my gaze. Boss Shepherd first; And then weird-looking Schenck; and him Lackeying, a silly man too slim Almost for seeing; there I knew My o'er-vile brother; Father, too— Respected shade; and all the Dents, Of general or particular bents; And Sharp; and nameless rel'tives; Red Ingalls; and Honoré,—my Fred Was with him, and our own judge Stone; Some other judges I could own; Harrington; Hastings; Elkins; Hatch; Jim Casey, whom I tried to catch, But, using Billings as a blind, He slipp'd that shade o' fraud behind: All these I saw; yet look'd around For others I had gladly found. Most miss'd I him, my Brave of Braves, Who ranged our soldiers in their graves, And, mindful of an ancient rite, Entomb'd their mules beside them. Sight Of him was granted me at last, Stuck in a marsh, stuck soft and fast, To the throat in dirt, and hot (I tried— Poor Belknap); and his head beside Sprawl'd crab-caught Robeson. Porter—not The advocate Ward Beecher got, Not Noah, but Horace,—my own man; Stewart; and Williams, playing fan For Chandler; Sargent; Logan; Blaine; Creswell, in straw; and then a train— No need to mention names of all— As if o' the House had been a call— Of Congressmen and Senators: All these met me; but not one stirs A tongue—perhaps too dry—to say If I should follow our old lay,— A lay which I began to doubt; Though 't was n't bad before found out. 'T was clear from them naught would be learn'd For my behoof. But I discern'd Dimly, upon the other side, Three forms, which noting, I descried As old-time friends. And as each nears The hot confine, across the spears He leans—that did not seem to burn, As intimating I should turn And list his meditated speech. Haughty yet sad the look of each, As condescending to the task Of answering what my thoughts but ask. Stanton was one, with brow severe; And Rawling, formerly so dear, Pale and attenuate as when He left me,—left both sword and pen; The third was Sumner, grand of port. I wish'd to speak; but they cut short My greetings, and their hands withdrew. Then Rawling spoke, the while he threw A scornful glance: “Hast thou forgot Thy promise pledged to me? thou Sot! Thou traitor to thy closest friends,— Carer but for thine own vile ends!” “Nay! rate him not!” said Sumner; “he, As I, was then too blind to see There was in Cuba any war.” And Stanton: “Yet that goeth, far Beyond your help or his; that fight Ends with the triumph of the Right, When Spain is foil'd and Cuba free. But what has Right to do with thee?” So turn'd their backs, the three, nor deign'd Mix words with me while I remain'd. From whom, then, should I learn if these Refused me? On my bended knees, Stiff as I am, I fell. “Return!” I cried, “O friends! old friends! nor spurn Ulysses thus.” But Rawling brook'd No further notice; Sumner look'd Over his shoulder. So they went, Like hasting stars i' the firmament, Giving no answer to my quest. Where else should my inquiry rest? I look'd, yet kneeling. By there came That gang whom decent men ne'er name Without due loathing of their greed: I knew the burly form of Tweed, Sweeny, and Connolly; and they Knew me, and spat, and moved away As from a viler criminal, worse Than the mere filcher of a purse. Then Johnson pass'd; and, passing, lifts His downcast eyes: “I would no gifts, Nor stole.” But Fisk came up and took My hand, and, with a kinder look,— “Cheer up, old man! You've had your play; Get off your knees and come away!” More humbled yet, I kneeling stay'd; When lo, a melancholy shade, One taller than the noble three, Yet loftier in his majesty, Of form rough-hewn, nor smooth in face, But wistful-eyed, with solemn pace Approach'd me trembling, with my doom, A requiem o'er my living tomb Pronounced in memorable words: “O wretch! 'gainst whom, like sharpen'd swords, The thoughts of honest men are held,— Thou who hadst power, if will, to have quell'd Corruption, as the open foe By thee was conquer'd,—thou below Advice or help hast placed thyself! Fool! bribed by Shame with vulgar pelf, Hence, nor pollute the neighborhood Of aught that 's honest, brave, or good! What term, twice tried, remains for thee? Only the term of Infamy!” He spoke, and left me to dismay. How came I back to upper day? Just then the Ingalls watch struck two. So late—Ulysses thought; but knew He could not trust the time it kept. Enough! Again Alcineus slept. BOOK THE FOURTH THE ARGUMENT He will not heed, nor heareth, one Of the fair Sirens three; Steals beef; and stricken by the Sun Falls ignominiously. Once more—his listener looking bored— Ulyss' pursueth his record. Would I had hearken'd as I pass'd The Sirens by; but I was fast By my own order, and my ears Stopp'd: for I reckon'd him who hears Such argument divine unfit To achieve Corruption. With the bit Between the teeth of virtuous will, He might go straightly on until His death. The speculation 's grave. Did I not once my country save? Now 't is my president right to spend. Thereafter—but who minds the end? So seem'd it to my meaner thought; My other genius utter'd naught To lead me. I was drunk with lust Of power and faithless to my trust, So cared not God or men to hear; But mine own course resolved to steer, Self-will'd, and ignorant as most. I bade them bind me to the post Midships; and ear-dull'd, so sped by The Sirens' holy harmony. This was their Song: so I was told By the boatswain,—he dared make so bold. First sang the Youngest of the Three: “O Wise Man! HONOR calls to thee. True soldier, whom the lands admired, What else but Honor thee inspired? Thou wilt have thought for reverend years. The heritage that most endears A father's memory, his claim To entry on the roll of Fame, Thou wilt provide to leave thy seed; And in thy pride stand fast “Stand fast, Craig Ellachie!” was the motto of the Grant family. indeed, Of sturdy sires the stalwart son, To bear the heroic legend on!” The Second sang: “Receive from me The high demands of PROBITY! Thy Country's trust, thy plighted word, Both make Fidelity thy lord, In whose dear service thou shalt be Named good for thy integrity; Nor other wealth desire or take, For simple Probity's own sake!” The Eldest last invoked a strain; Heaven heard, and echoed back again:— “The Powers that gave thee power command A full surrender at thy hand; Requiring thee in the name of Power To guard the right, to lead the hour From darkness into hoped-for light; And summon thee with all thy might To stand upon the broad highway Of Order, so that all obey The Eternal Law; so shalt thou shine Hereafter, star-like and divine, A beacon unto future days, To guide men on RELIGION's ways.” And then in chorus sang the Three, How Honor, Truth, and Faith agree, And with a triple chord uphold Their lover, with wealth more than gold Endowing him. Ah me! in vain That music—lost, ne'er heard again. Deaf! deaf! I would not heed their cry, But wrapp'd in hide of self pass'd by. My record 's drawing to a close. (He saw the King began to doze.) It was not I who stole the cows And oxen. But whoso allows, With power to hinder, does the wrong. Would I had heard the Sirens' Song! Too late! too late! That Indian beef, Least of my thefts, brought me to grief. Those poor post-trade-ships,—Oervile's share, So small too, and—I would not care So much for it, but— Here the Muse Takes up Ulysses' tale. The news Of what next happ'd to Truth belongs And History. He gave the thongs That bound the cattle of the Sun, Whose Indian children so were done Out of their dinners. Unespied's The theft, thought he, and safe our hides! He ate the beef, and, crafty man! Conceal'd the skins, and meant to tan The same, when to his home return'd In far Galena. Hotly burn'd Apollo's wrath. In radiant prime Forth issuing, the hidden crime He saw. Swift from the golden edge Of his cloud-chariot flew a wedge Of sunlight through the felon's brain. Transfix'd, he fell. There leave him, slain; And let the Shades receive his ghost Unmourn'd! In Bryant's Evening Post Look for, beneath the Obit head, U. G?t! And so Ulysses sped. AUGIES AND ALLSIDES AUGIES the monarch's name was, who his stable Kept in a state so foul that all unable Were the beasts to be upright in 't: so the Gods Sent to their aid ALLSIDÉS, who, at odds With all things dirty, took him a new Broom And swept the stable clean. Heaven send us such a groom! A. R.</field>
