      <field name="fulltext">The seuen sorowes that women haue when theyr husbandes be deade. The excuse of the Authour. To all archewyues I do pray instantly And to all wydowes of the seconde degree Me to excuse, that ignorantly your wordes to wryth I haue taken on me For suerly it is of no malignitite But only to comforte young wyues that haue young louyng husbandes in their felicite Now after their death they may them haue. Prologue of Robert Copland. Copland. Why should I muse suche tryfles for to wryte Or wanton toyes, but for the appetyte Of wandryng braynes, that seke for thynges new And do not reche if they be fals or trew. Quidam. With what newes? or here ye any tidinges Of the pope, of the Emperour, or of kynges Of martyn Luther, or of the great Turke Of this and that, and how the world doth worke. Copland. So that the tongue must euer wagge &amp; clatter And waste their wyndes, to medle of eche matter Thus ben we prynters called on so fast That maruayle it is, how that our wittes can last. Quidam. With haue ye the takyng of the Frenche kyng Or what conceytes haue ye of laughyng Haue ye the balade called maugh murre Or bony wenche, or els go from my durre Col to me, or hey downe dery dery Or a my hert, or I pray yoll be mery. Copland. Thus if our heades forged were of brasse yet shoulde we were as dulle as any asse And al of baggage nought worthe insubstaunce But bokes of vertue haue none vtteraunce As thus, syr I haue a very proper boke Of morall wysdome please ye their on to loke Of els a boke of comen consolation. Quidam. Tusshe a straw man, what should I do therewith Hast thou a boke of the wydowe Edith That hath begyled so many with her wordes Or els suche a geest that is ful of bourdes Let me se, I wyll yet waste a peny Upon suche thynges and if thou haue eny. Copland. How say ye by these, wyll ye bestowe a grote Quidam. ye syr somuche? nay, that I shorowe my cote A peny I trow is ynough on bokes It is not so soone goten, as this worlde lokes By saynt Mary I cannot tell the brother Money euer goeth for one thyng or for other God helpe my fryende, this worlde is harde &amp; kene They that haue it wyll not let it be sene But let that passe vn to another tyme Haue ye not seene a prety geest in tyme Of the seuen sorowes that these women haue whan that their husbandes been brought to graue. Copland. No I fayth, I dyd neuer here ther of. Quidam. By God and it is a very propre scoffe If it were prynted, it wyl be wel soulde I haue heard it or now, ful madly tolde. Copland. It may well be, but I wene I should gyt Displeasure of women if that I prynt it And that were I loth, for I haue alway Defended them, and wyll to my last day. Quidam. Ah ha, than I se ye be wel at ease Whan ye are afrayde women to displease. Copland. What nede me gette angre, if I may haue th?ke In faythe I can not se, but as madde a pranke as soone wyl a man do as a woman why should they be rayled and gested on than And to say soth it is but a fond apetyte To geste on women, or a gainst them to wryte. Quidam. That is truthe, if they be good and honest But this is but a mery bourdyng Ieest without reproufe, dishonesty or shame That in no wyse can appayre their good name. Copland. That is good, but haue ye any copy That a man myght enprynt it thereby And whan I se it, than I wyll you tell. If that the matter be ordred yll or well. Quidam. I haue no boke, but yet I can you shewe The matter by herte, and that by wordes fewe Take your penne, and wryte as I do say But yet of one thyng, hertely I you praye Amende the englysh somwhat if ye can. And spel it true, for I shall tel the man By my soule ye prynters make such englyshe So yll spelled, so yll poynted, and so peuyshe That scantly one cane rede lynes tow But to fynde sentence, he hath ynought to do For in good fayth, yf I should say truthe In your craft to suffer, it is great ruthe Suche pochers to medle, and cannot skyl Of that they do, but doth al marre and spyl I ensure you, your wardeins ben therof to blame It hyndreth your gayne and hurteth your name Howe be it, it is al one to mee Whether ye thryue, or elles nenuer thee. Copland. Wel brother. I can it not a mende I wyl no man ther of dyscommende I care no greatly, so that I nowe and than May get a peny as wel as I can Howe be it, in our crafte I knowe that there be Lounyng good worke men, and that is to se In latyn and englysh, whiche they haue wrought Whose names appereth, where they be sought Put to one purpose, nowe tourne we a gayne And let me begyn to wryte a lyne or twayne. Quidam. Wyth al my hert, but fyrst I pray you say Unto all women that I them hertely pray To haue me excused of thys homely dede And what I say, of themselfe take no hede The fyrst sorowe. The fyrst sorowe that these women haue Is or theyr husbandes be layde in graue And that is duble in this maner wyse This man full sycke in deadly paynes lyse Many a daye, nygh to the houre of deth His eyene dymineth, and very shorte is his breth The flew me ratleth in his brest and throte His powlces beten, his tonnge is roughe and hote Phisicions forsake him euery chone Whan that they se his money almost gone Than this pore woman that so hreatly toyled Wrappyge, and warminge w? many a hand defoyled Doth hym beholde, and seeth he wyll dye The holy candell she lyghteth hym by And so helyet consumyng to his ende This wyfe then that busely doth hym tende Seing hym lye to longe in that case Wyth droppes and markes in euery place Consyderyng her good, that is gretly spente And the candell well nygh wasten and brent She loketh on the candell wyth a dolefull gost Alas seyth she, thou arte gone almost Now shall I forgo thy company Whan thou arte gone, I ensure perfytely To my lyues nede I wyll haue no mo For thy sake, I haue the loued so Alas good woman full wo arte thou But what wylt thou do wyth hym now Bury hym, alas thou arte ther to full loth But though that she be neuer so wrothe It must be done, and so this good woman Ordreth all thynges so well as she can For his buryenge, and other seruyce So cometh the presses and other lykewyse As the mourners, and executours Torche berers, kynsfolke and neyghbours Than is the corps layd on the bere Or in a coffyn as the guyse is here Than this pore widow clothed all in blacke Of sorow be sure she doth nothyng lacke From her chamber she cometh a downe Than for great fere to fall in aswowne Upon her she bereth some confeccion As powder of peper, or a red onyon And whau she cometh thre y? corps doth lye Her handes she wryngeth pyteously Out out alas, what shall I do forth on Wolde god I were by thy graue anon This sorow is longe, what shal me now betyde A beseche Iesu thy soule in heauen may bide. The second sorow. The seconde sorow that these wyues do make Is whan .iiii. men the corps on th? do take Toward the chyrche, and the prestes do syng This wofull wydow al waye folowyng With bedes in hande, in mournynge hood God knoweth yf syghes do her any good Now thinketh she, here haue I much to do And haply thys wydowe hath a shorte sho That streyneth her toes, and doeth hurte her fote Than thynketh she, I be shrew the hearte rote Of the horeson sowter, it greueth me so And to the chrche we haue ferre to go Or els she is laced in her new blacke gowne That for straytnes she is lyke to swone Or els it may fortune so that she Hath in her som lose infyrmyte Or els the wynde doth waste the waxe to sore And she knowes well that she must pay therfore But whan they nyghe vnto the churche be who soroweth nowe: for so the none but she I can suppose, beyng so nere the place where he must rest, this is a heuy case Who sygheth now, alas this pore woman For I am sure that she woulde be as than As farre homewarde, but she dothe take in worthe This heuy chaunce, and wofully goeth forthe And to her selfe alpryuely doth saye what remedy all is wel on the waye well a way, than sayd the executour That ledeth her, why make ye this dolour I you ensure that ye do God displease So for to fare, but it were more ease For the soule, to saye som good oreyson Nothynge can helpe your lamentacyon Alas syr she sayeth, ye saye of certaynete But yet my heart can not so serue me And therewithall she doeth wepe so fast That her heart tikleth as it would brast O kynde womane I blame the not at all Thou woulde hym haue in christen buryall The thyrd sorowe. Forth now than goeth this wofull creature To the thyrd sorowe. I may you well ensure In to the chyrche and sytteth in a pewe Full often than channgeth all her hewe For veray fayntnes, or is to harde enbraced Would God sayth she that I were vnlaced Or els may chaunce with chylde that she go Of.x.wekes tyme, or haply of mo Or els some qualme may in her stomacke ryse As women haue in many dyuers wyse But for all that this wydowe sytteth styll Puttyng herselfe all in goddes wyll Hearyng deuoutly the deuyne songe A Iesu mercy thys seruyce is longe And she is very sycke and would be thence In fayth I had leuer that.xl.pence She were awaye, so I myght her excuse But not so, she will her selfe sadly vse Men shal not say y? she would fayne be ryde Her sorowes shalbe womanly hyde And in her prayers, her selfe occupy Ne were it so that the beggers cry On her so faste and let her for to pray with some good man haue these folke away I neuer sawe such folke, and so lewde withstande at the dore knaues al be shrewde ye troble this woman, and it is no nede Come to morowe and ye may haply spede Thus is thys woman troublously arayde Tyll that the last dyryge is sayde And wyth the corps walketh to the pytte But than in dede harde is to forgette Alas sayth the, all this busines Nowe were me leuer for to die than lyfe Now wyll I all my goodes away gyue The mantyll and ryng, now wyll I take Alas alas, now must I leue my make Fare well my Ioye, thou art gone for euer Ah my poreherte in sonder wyll sheuer Ah fals death, why haste thou hym so slayne And leueth me here in thys most woful payne Thus nethelesse, this man is layde alowe And than y? priest earth vp? him doth throw She seyng that loketh full heuely Upon the clerke, and wofully doth crye A good swete man, please it the trinite That I were layd vpryght vnder thee Whan this is done though it be to her payne As wo full as she went, she must go home a gayne The fourth sorowe.
