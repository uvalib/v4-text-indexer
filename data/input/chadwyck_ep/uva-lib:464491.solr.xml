Egerton MS. 1995 This boke ys callyd the vij sages of Rome. Herkenythe lodynges curteys and hende Howe thys gentylle geste shalle ende. Sum tyme there was an Emperoure, That ladde hys lyfe with moche honowre, Hys name was Dioclician, And was a wonder riche man, And was Emperoure of Rome, A nobylle man and a wyse of dome. He hadde an Emporas to wyfe, Men wyste non fayrer on lyue. A sone they hadde hym bytwyne, No fayrer chylde ne myght bene. But soone aftyr thenne The Emporas dyde and went henne The chylde wax to vij yere olde, Wyse of speche ande dedys bolde, Florentyne hys name was, Herkenythe nowe a wonder cas. Hys Fadyr was olde and ganne to hoore, His sone thoo he sette to lore, And lette byfore hym com sone The vij sagys that were yn Rome. To hem he thought his sone take Forto knowe the letters blacke, For they were wysyst men leryde That were Amonge alle mydylerthe The Emperoure sayde anon To the maysterys eurychone âWhiche of you wille take my sone To teche hym wysdome, as ye cone?â Bancillas thoo spake byfore, The eldyste man with lockys hoore, And sayde âcertys, take me thy sone, And moche thonke j wylle the cone, And j wylle teche the alle the lawys, That j canne and my felowys. That dar j, syre, take yn honde In vij yere, j vnderstonde.â Sone in a while aftyr that A mayster spake of sympylle state, Nother the moste, nother the leste, But as hym semyd aldyr beste. Anxulles was hys ryght name, A better clerke was non of fame. âSyr, he sayde to the Emperoure, Take me thy sone peramoure, And as y am a trewe man, I shalle teche hym that j canne, And that my felowys canne alle so, In vij yere withowtyn anny moo.â The iij mayster was a lyght man With louesum lere as whytte as swanne, Hys here was cryspe and noo thyng rous, His name was callyd Lentyllous. He sayde anon to the kyng âTake sone thyne into my kepyng And j wylle swere the an othe That j can and felowys bothe Uppon payne of lemys and lyfe, I shalle teche hym in yerys v.â The iiij mayster a redman was, Men hym callyd Malquydras. He was but of xv yere olde, He was a wysse man and a bolde. âSyr, he sayde, nowe herkenythe vnto me, My felowys wyt ys nott in me, Nothyr of hyr wyt in noo wyse I wylle not make noo marchantyse; But take me thy sone, Syr Emperoure, And j shalle hym teche in yerys iiij. Al that j canne of clergye Of mone and sterre and of the skye.â The v mayster was wyse of dome, Hys name was callyd Catonne of Rome. He made Catonne, jwis, That many a chylde of leryde ys, And âsyr, he sayde vnto the kynge, Take thy sone vnto my techynge. I wylle that he be nought becaughte, Thy sones wyt ne knowe j noughte, Nother of hys age, nothyr of hys blode, But, syr, j shalle teche hym goode Also moche thoroughe goddys sonde, As he may welle vnderstonde And as hys wit wylle hym helpe, Othyr wyse wylle j not yelpe, So that by the ende of vij yere No chylde noo where shalle be hys pere.â The vj mayster spake thoo anon, The fayreste man of euery-chon, Gesse was hys name hote, A comely ma[n] fro toppe to foote. âSyr, he sayde to the kynge, Take me thy sone so yonge. I shalle teche hym in yerys iij Al that j canne whythe herte free, And so ye shulle, syr, for hys lore bolde Euyrmore to me beholde.â The vij mayster hette Maxious, A ryght wyse man and a vertuous, All his lyf with moche honowre He hadde seruyde the Emperoure, âSyr, he sayde, in alle wyse Balliol College MS. 354 Here begynneth Ã¾e prologes of vij sages or vij wise masters which were named as here after ffolowith. In olde Days ther was a man, His name was Dyoclesyan, Of Rome and of all Ã¾e honowr He was lorde and Emprowr. An Empresse he had full gent, That was called Mylycent. A chylde they had betwen them two, The ffayrest Ã¾at myght on erthe goo. The Emperyse passed henne The comvne way of all men. Tho was [t]he sone vij yere olde, Wise, ffayre, and eke bolde, Fflorentyne his name was, Herkeneth now a wondre caas. The emperowr began to hore, He thowght to sett his son to lore, He lett call and beffore hym come Seven Ã¾e wyseste Ã¾at were in Rome, He sayd to them âlordynges gent, After you j haue sente, For ye be Ã¾e wyseste men leryd That be in all medyllerde. My son j will betake to you To teche hym well for your prowe. Whiche of you shall j hym betake To teche hym the lettres blake?â Bancyllas than spake beffore, The eldeste man with lokkes hore; Bothe was he lene and longe, And most jentyll them amonge. Of gramar he do cowld all Ã¾e pars And also of all the vij ars. He spake ffirst to the Emperowr, A ffayrer worde with myche honowr. âSir, he said, take me your childe, I will to hym be meke and mylde, I will hym teche very ffayne All that j can to hym sayne. I will hym take on hand right here, That he shall in vij yere Lerne ynowgh of euery lore. My lorde what wolde ye aske more?â Anon right after that Spake a master of medyll state, Not with the leste, ne with Ã¾e meste, But as it becom hym beste. His lokkes were whit and hore, But of clargy he cowld more Than any other that men knewe. He was jn party pale of hewe, Ancyllas was his right name, He was a clarke of gret ffame. He said âtake your sonne to me And j will suerly siker the, As j am clarke and trewe man, I will hym teche as well as j can And of that my felowes can also With in thys vj yere and mo.â After hym spake Lentilius than, Lene of flesshe and somdele wan The child he desired thoo Fforthe with hym Ã¾at he myght goo; And thus he said to Ã¾e emperowr âTake me your sonne, paramowr, And j will take charge vpon an othe All that j can and my felowes bothe, I will hym teche, vpon my lyff, Sone vppon this yeres ffyve.â The iiij?? master a rede man was, His name was Malendryas. He was of twenty wynter olde, Prudent, wise, and of speche bolde. âSir, he said, harken to me And take good hede what j say to the. With non of them in no wise Make this day marchandyse, But take hym to me and j will hym teche; Off euery maner mannes speche I will hym teche in yeres ffowr, That all men shall hym honowr. He shall lern all maner clergyse, That any tonge can devise.â Now of the v?? tell we than That hight Caton Ã¾e wise man. A boke that Caton called ys Makyth children warre and wise. Caton sayd âover all thyng, Take me your sonne in kepyng. The childys will knowe ye nowght, Full esyly he muste be vp browght, Ffor he ys tender of fflesche and blode, In goodly wise j will teche hym good As myche as he may vnderstonde, Whan that j haue hym vnder honde. To you make j no more speche, As well as j can, j will hym teche.â An other master come anon, The ffayrest of them euerychon, Jesse was his name jhoote, Withowt weme ffrom hede to fote. His here was yelow as the safferon, He loked lustely as a ffawcon. âSir, he sayd vnto the kynge, Lett your yonge son to me bryng, I will hym teche with will ffree That within this yeres three, In clargy j shall hym bolde, That euer to me thow shalt be behold.â The vij master hight Maxius, A right wise man and a vertuous, All his lyff with gret honowr He had serued the emprowr. âSir, he sayd, in all wise The main body of the text from lines 120â2770 is a composite text. For Ã¾e mede of mi seruise Tac me Ã¾i sone to loke and lore; Of mi seruise kep i nammore; And i Ã¾e wille Ã¾onke conne, And al Ã¾e clergie vnder sonne Ich wille in to his bodi di?t, BoÃ¾e bi dai and bi ni?t.â Dioclecian Ã¾e maistres herde, He strok his berd, and schok his ?erde, And on hem made milde chere And spak that hi alle mi?te ihere: âÃonke i ?ou kan, gode lordingges, Of ?oure gentil answerungges I kan ?ou thonke of ?oure speche, Ãat ?e desire mi sone to teche, ?oure compaignie is fair and gent, Nel ich hit departe verraiment.â He tok his sone bi Ã¾e hond anon, An bitau?te him to hem euerichon.

The knyght come forthe, withowtyn lette, The Erle in kneys he grette, And sayde, âsyr, j am a knyght That in many contreys j was holde wyght, But there j dar not com nowe For a knyght that j there slowe, And, syr, yf thy wylle be, Here j wylle abyde with the.â âWelcome, sayde the Erle tho, I haue nede of the and of mo, For many enemys j haue withowte That dystryethe my londe aboute.â So that with the Erle dwellyd that knyght, And wan hys londe ayenne in fyght; And slayne hys enemys in fyghtynge, The Erle louyd hym ouyr alle thynge, And toke hym hys goodys into hys hande, And made hym stywarde ouyr alle hys lande. So oppon a day with moche honoure The knyght come playnge by the toure That the lady was yn jdone, Sho lokyd owte and saye hym sone, And toke a letter jwretyn fulle ryght, And caste hit downe before the knyght. The knyght toke the letter anon And vndyde hit and lokyd there on. He hadde wounder whoo hit threwe, But there by the lady he knewe, And that he shulde with hyr play For any thyng that any man couthe say. The knyght thought hym full stylle Howe he myght haue hyr at wylle, And to the Erle he went fulle euenne, And prayde hym to gyf hym leuenne To make a chambyr byfore the toure That may ben for my honoure. The Erle thought non euyl thon And grauntyd the knyght to done son; The knyght toke workemen anon And made a chambyr of lyme and ston, Thenne thought he vppon sum quente gynne Howe he myght to that lady wynne. Thenne was there a mason fre, The slyeste man that myght be; The knyght aftyr the mason sent And sayde to hym al hys entent. âMay j telle the of my preuyte?â âYe, syr, sayde the mason fre, Boldely syr your wylle ysayne And j shalle you neuyr bewreyne.â The knyght sayde âsythe hit ys so, I wylle the telle what Ã¾ou moste doo; For in thys toure there ys a lady, That j haue louyd fulle hertely, And in that toure Ã¾ou moste make An hoole for that ladys sake, That j may loude and stylle Gon to hyr and doo my wylle.â The mason sayde hit shulde ben done, And a preuy hoole he made sone. Whenne he hadde done hys queyntyse, Fulle euylle he quyttyde hys seruyse; The knyght hym slowe there, certayne, For he shulde hym not bewrayne; And whenne he hadde don so sykerly He went vppe to that fayre lady. Whenne sche hym sawe she made blys, And kyste many sythys jwis, And wyste that hit was that gentyl knyght Of whom hyr dremyng was a nyght. âSyr, she sayde, welcome ye be,â And so tyl hyr answeryde he, And sayde, âlemman lady, God the saue allemyghty.â He toke hyr in hy[s] armys two And dyd with hyr that he wolde do. Whenne he hadde done hys lykyng, The lady toke hym hyr golde rynge, For he shulde thyngke hyr vppon. He toke hys leue and went anon, And wente as he cam certayne, And stoppyd the hole faste agayne, And to hys lorde he went yare, Ryght as no thyng a mys were. Thenne wasche they, and went to mete, And as they to gedyr sete, The Erle sawe hys golde rynge there, And hadde grete wondyr howe hit were, For the Erle hadde for grete loue That golde ryng to hys wyf youe. The Erle was curtays and welle jthaught, And to the knyght sayde ryght naught, But whenne the Erle hadde etyn anon, Towarde hys towre he gan gone, To wyt where the ryng was; The knyght was ware of that cas, And wente thedyr byfore certayne, And toke the lady the rynge agayne. The erle com to hyr wel ?are And axyde of hyr howe she dyd fare, The lady answeryd hyr lorde thenne âIshytt j am fro alle men, Comforte of man haue j no dele Howe shalle j thanne fare wele.â âLemman, sayde the Erle tho, Wher haste Ã¾ou my golde ryng do?â Tho answeryde that lady sone âWhat haue ye there with to done?

The Erle dwellyd wythe hyr al nyghte For joye of the rynges syght, And for alle that, withowtyn lye, Blereyd were bothe hys yee. A morowe he ros fulle erly, And lefte a bedde that fayre lady; He sent aftyr that knyght preste To hunt with hym in the foreste. âNay, certes, sayde the knyght tho, I may not nowe with you go, For me ys broughte a newe thynge, That ys goode to my lykynge; For my frendys haue won my pes In my contray, withowtyn les, Al with ryght and not with woo For a knyght that j dyd slo.

Thenne sayd the Erle âknyght, for thy curtesy, Of whennys ys thys fayre lady?â Thenne sayde the knyght with wordys fre âHyt ys a lady of my contre.

Anon as the Erle was jwent, The knyght toke the lady gent, And dyd on hir robe agayne, And lad hyr in the toure certayne. Vnnethe the knyght was agon, That the Erle cam jn anon, And there he founde hys lady In hyr chambyr alle redy.

Whenne the chylde was in the see flode, He cryde to god with mylde mode, God hyrde that chylde and gaf hym grace, He come to londe in a fayre place, Vppon a fayre roche of stone. iiij dayes mete ete he non, Mete ne drynke ne othyr thynge, But foulys he hyrde mery synge.

The sowdan answered anon: âWe ben redy euerychone.â The morow can and this Junyus Stode in a towr that hight Cressus, The strengest towr vpon the wall, Ther men myght se hym over all. He had made a myrrowr, Which he bare vp in to the towr; He set hym ther on, verament, And dide on his garment; He dide also on his visowr And loked in his myrrowr. Two swordes he owt brayde And fast with them he on layde, He made more noyse and more boste Than wolde half a gret oste. The sarasyns Ã¾at loked on it Were nygh owt of ther wit; The myrrowr gan so fast rowt That all Ã¾e people were in dowt. By the myrrowr they vnderstode That it was god Ã¾at dyed on rode. In gret drede they flede echon, Ther durste abide non. The yates were vndo of Rome And all people ther at owt come. The emprowr overtoke his ffoon And slew them down euerychone; And thus Junyus the wysse Wane the mastry by quayntise; Therfor he hadde gret honowr, And was made emprowr. Ther is a moneth in the yere That is cleped Jenyfere. Sire, than thou shalt fall in bale, And an other shall haue thy power all, And thus shall the vij wise Disceyve the with ther quayntyse.

The kyng comaundyd blyve That he shuld be browght owt of live. Tho ca[m] master Maxius ride And bade the folk they shuld abide, âTyll j haue spokyn with Ã¾e kyng And ye shall haue good tydyng.â They stode still, all and some; The master to the emprowr is come, He was a master withowt lak, Ffor hardly to Ã¾e emprowr he spake And sayd âevill mot thow cheve Thyn empryse yf thow beleve. She is, he sayd, sotyll and false, In her wordes and dedes alse, And by thyn empryse own will This day thou woldest thy son spill, And yf he myght till to morow leve, For all Ã¾e werld Ã¾ou woldest hym not geve. Yf Ã¾ou hym sleest, so fall on the As fell on an erle of ferre contre. Myche more he loved his wiff Than he dide his won lyff.â Than says the emprowr anon âHe was a fole, by seynt John! Tell me the tale, j pray the, And this day j will warant the My son from deth for to quyte, And of his lyff hym respite.â âSire, than shalt thow beleve me, Thy wyff hath more gilt than he, Ffor to morow he shall speke And rightfully hymself awreke.â Quod the emprowr âwithowt othe, Yf j may know the sothe Who hath wrong and who hath right, After the lawe jugement shall be dight.â He bade his seriantes forthe gon And brynge to hym his son anon; They went anon and dide all thus, Than sayd the emprowr to Maxius âMaster, tell me all the caas, How the erle disseved was.â Maxius tale of an erle how a knyght disseyved hym of his wiff. âSir, he sayd, j will not lye, In the kyngdom of Hungrye Somtyme ther was a dowty knyght, Riche he was and stronge in fight. In a nyght as he a slepe was, He dremed he was jn suche a caas; A lady shuld hym love well That dwellyd in a stronge castell. She was a full gret lady, But he wyste not in what contrey He shuld fynd that lady bryght, But myght he of her haue a sight, Of her he shuld haue knowlegynge, He wyste well by his dremynge. Whan he had this dreme mett, Forth he went sone after that, All a moneth he travayled sore And he was of his purpose never Ã¾e nere. So dremed that lady ther she was, To her shuld fall suche a caas: After a knyghtes love she shuld fonde, But she wyste not in what londe, That she shuld fynde his wonnynge; Therfor she was in myche mornynge. The knyght his way hath ynome And to a castel is he come. An erle Ã¾erover lorde was, Stowte and bold in euery caas. He had a lady to his wyff, That he loved better than his lyff; Ffor jolesye that lady flowr He shete her faste in a towre, Ãat she myght not owt day ne nyght To play her with swayn ne knyght. An other erle agayn hym tho Warred and dide hym myche woo; He dysstroyed so his londe That it was nygh owt of his honde. Than com rydyng Ã¾at jentyll knyght, That had sowght that lady bryght. With ther spekyng Ã¾at lady flowr Loked down owt of the towr, And also this jentyll knyght Loked vp to Ã¾at lady bryght, Whan he her sigh for joy he songe, Moche myrthe Ã¾e knyght made amonge; And whan she harde hym syng ther, Vnneth she cowld herself forbere, But Ã¾at she shuld hym speke to, But for her lorde she durste not soo. Than wyste Ã¾e knyght by Ã¾at sight, Hit was she Ã¾at he dremed of by nyght; And she wyste also by all thynge That he shuld her ease of her dremynge. He badde vndo at the gate Sone he was latt in ther at. The knyght on knees fayre hym sett, And the erle ther he gret, And sayd, âsir, j am a knyght, And a man Ã¾at hath had to do with fight In my contrey a knyght j slowe, And j dare never com ther nowe. I wold, yf your will were, In this contrey dwell with you here.â âWelcome, sayd Ã¾e erle to hym thoo, I haue nede to the and many moo. Ffull many a foo j haue withowt That distroy my londe abowt. With good will ye shall bide here.â âGramarcy, said Ã¾e knyght, by seynt Richere, Than shall j at your lyvery be, At hors, armes, and in ffee.â This erle and Ã¾e knyght to batell be gon Ffor to be awroken of ther ffoon; The knyght hym so well bare than, The erle loved hym more than any man; He toke his rodde in his honde And made hym styward of his londe. So this knyght vpon a day Went vp and down hym to play By Ã¾e towr wher Ã¾at lady was Ffor to haue of her solas. This lady in Ã¾e towr on high Loked down and Ã¾e knyght sigh; She toke a see risshe and threw down right, Vpon the gretter ende it pight, This knyght Ã¾erto toke good kepe, And toke vp Ã¾e risshe beffore his ffete, And full trewly he than knewe That Ã¾e lady down it threwe. Then he longid, Ã¾e sothe to say, Howe that he myght with her play; But euer more he held hym styll, And thowght how he myght haue his will Of that lady Ã¾at he ther sigh In the towr that was so high. On a tyme as they sat at the borde, Bothe the knyght and the lorde, âSir, quod the knyght, j pray ye, A place that ye will graunt me To byld a chambre by your towr Therin to dwell for your honowr. Graunt me, sir, so god ye save, That j may myn ease haue.â âSire, said the erle thoo, That Ã¾ou askeste j grant ther too, To fulfill in all thynge, That to me ys longyng.â âSir, quod the knyght, god thank you; That you me love, j fele nowe.â Carpenters were fett anon And masons for to hewe Ã¾e ston. A ffayre hows in that stede The knyght anon arrered in dede. Whan he had this hows made, In his hart he was full glade. Than he bethowght with what gyn That fayre lady for to wyn. So it beffell that in the town Dwellid a newe mason, And comen he was from ferre Contre, Ther was no slyer man than he. The knyght that mason to hym fett, And by his side he hym sett. Than sayd this knyght to Ã¾e mason âThow art welcom to this town, But, master mason, may j truste the To tell to the my pryvyte?â âYe, sir, hardely your will ye say, Ffor j you shall never bewray.â âThow seieste well, quod Ã¾e knyght anon, I will the tell howe it moste gon. Ther dwellith a lady in this towr That me loveth paramowr, And j for her am nere dede; Master mason, canste thow any rede To perce thorow this high towr, And brynge adown Ã¾at lady flowr. Me thynkith myn harte well breke, Tyll that j may with her speke. Master, canste thow any quayntyse, An hole in this wall to devise That j myght vp to her goo? My love were thyn for euermoo.â Than sayd the mason âhold you still, And you shall spek with her your ffyll.â The mason went home, and fett his toole, And in the tour he made an hole, That he and she both lowde and still Might come togeder at ther will. Whan the knyght knewe of this He made myche joy and blis; But he quytte evyll the masons seruyse Ffor he hym slowgh for his quayntise. The mason that helped hym therto, The knyght hym slewe whan he had do. After that he went anon In to the towr made of ston, And came ther this lady was; She shone as bryght as any glas. Whan she hym sigh, she made hym blis And eyther other than gan kysse For she thowght it was the knyght That she dremed of vpon a nyght She sayd âsire, welcome ye beâ And in this maner answered he: âMy love and my hertes ease, God the save from disease.â He toke her in his armes twoo And dide all that he wold doo. When they had do ther will, A down went Ã¾e knyght full styll, Ffor he wold not ther be ynome, Whan his lorde vp shuld come, And at ther departynge This lady hym toke a good gold rynge, And bade his hart shuld o[n] her stonde, While he had it on his honde. Anon this knyght stopped all The holes that were in the wall, And went to his lorde anon As sone as ever he myght gon, And as they spoke of many a thynge, The erle was ware of this rynge, On the knyghtes fynger as it was; Than was the erle in sory caas, For he had geven to his lady This rynge for gret love trewly, Wherfor he wondred myche tho, How this knyght was come ther to; But he was so well bethowght That to the knyght he sayd nowght. He thowght his lyff was nygh gon, Tyll he to his lady come To wytt wher this rynge was. The knyght was ware of that caas, To the lady he went anon, And was ther affore Ã¾e erle come; Anon the rynge he to her caste, And went a down jn gret haste. Sone after the erle, her lorde, come, And for the rynge he asked anon, And in what estate that she were By herself to leve ther. She sayd âsire, right nowght for sothe, This dwellyng lytill good it dothe, Thus alone ffrom all men In good estate how shuld j be then? Why axe ye sir, sayd this lady, As ye me leve, tell me whye?â âDame, sayd the erle tho, Ffor good love j it do, Ffor j wold not day ne nyght That any man shuld do to Ã¾e vnright. My swete byrde and my derlynge, May j se that same rynge That j vnto your new yeres gift gaff?â âYe, sire, she sayd, it is ffull saff; Loo it is here ffast by At your will all redye.â The rynge of gold she tok her lorde Betwen them two than was accorde. Myche wondred the erle of this, The rynge he toke agayn ywis, And he lay with her that nyght Ffor joye of the rynges sight. In morowe he rose anon, Down of the towr he gan gon, Right anon to Ã¾e chirch he wente, And after that knyght he sente. The knyght anon his way nome, The erle sayd he was welcome. âAn hontyng we will in to Ã¾e foreste To take ther som wild beste.â Nay, sire, sayde the [knyght] thoo, With you may j not go, Ffor j haue harde a newe tydynge Whiche is to me right good lykynge: In my contrey, it is no lesse, My frendes haue made my pees. Suche tydynges they haue me browght, My lady that me wide hath sowght. Home j moste to my Contre, Therfor, sire, for charyte, That ye wold with me dyne this day; My lady with you shall sytt, parffay,â âGladly, sayd Ã¾e erle, by Mary, I will her bere Companye. Your lady and you bothe this day, I will you chere as well as j may.â Whan it is tyme, send after me, And gladly j will come to the.â The while Ã¾e erle an hontyng was, Besyar than he no man was, The knyght his hows gan dight With all the riches that he myght, With clothes of golde that ryche be, And dyueris metes gret plente, And after into the towr he went, Ther was that lady fayre and gent, He browght her down in to his hows, As hit had been his own spouse. He lett do of her robe anon That she ffirst hade vpon, He clothed her in Ã¾e gise of his contrey, Suche was ther never say, On her ffyngers he made do on Rynges withe stones many on, Her hed he dressed wondreliche With garlandes, kyrcheves, and stones riche, That her lorde ne non other wight Shuld her know well a right. The knyght ffett Ã¾e erle anon, And made hym wasshe with his lemon, And afterward togeder them sett, He made his wiff his own bett. The erle her chered and well wente he That she hade ben of Ã¾e knyghtes contre. All the while he by her was, He behelde her in the face, He thowght she loked lyke his wyff, That he loved as his lyff, But that lady in all caas To hym made right gret solas. She bade hym ete and be glad, But ever he satt as he were made, But he thowght pryvyliche That many a woman was oÃ¾er liche. Whan they hade eten and don, The erle asked leve to gon; Longe he thowght Ã¾at he was ther, Of his lady he was in ffere, Whan the erle home went, The knyght toke that lady gent, And dide her tyre anon, And caste her own rayment her vpon; The kyght was sotill and slye, And browght her in to Ã¾e towr on hye. Vnneth the knyght was gon, But that Ã¾e erle in come; Anon he loked ffaste in hye, And fonde his lady ther redy; Than was he in hart gladde, That beffore was nygh madde. He thowght she was like his lady, That at mete satt hym by; Therfor he lay ther that nyght, Tyll on the morow Ã¾e day was light. The knyght had a ship all yare, Shipmen ynowe ther in Ã¾er ware, Anon he dide to shipe brynge His armure and all his oÃ¾er thynge That he had in that Castell; And was shipped ffayre and well. The erle to chirche on Ã¾e morow went, Whan that god hym tyme sent; The knyght went vp in to Ã¾e towr, And browght down that lady fflowr, Well reparayled at his devise, Of her he thowght a gret pryse. He ledde her to the erle blyve And badde hym geve her to his wyve, Ffor she loved hym beffore, He her loved myche the more. Than sayd the erle with good will âAll thy desyre j shall fulfill.â And he toke his wyff blyve, And gaff to Ã¾e knyght to wyve. The preste was redy anon tho, And wedded them togeder both two. Whan the masse was come to ende, They toke leve ffor to wende. He ladde Ã¾at lady with solas To the haven ther Ã¾e shippe was. The erle toke that lady bryght By Ã¾e honde and toke her to Ã¾e knyght, The knyght toke that lady then And said âgramarcy, sir, by all men.â The shippe in haste went a way, Ther the erle his wiff laste say. Whan the knyght was gon, The erle went forthe anon Vnto the towr full right To speke with his lady bright. Whan Ã¾at he cam vp an hye, His lady no thynge Ã¾er he sye. He began to crye and wepe sore, He wyste not what to do more. To late wisedom he began, Therfor hym skorned many a man, And so do ye, for sothe ywys, Wherof in londe myche wondre is, That ye will triste so myche your wiff Ffor to bynyme your sone his lyff. To morow ye shall the sothe ffonge. Who hath Ã¾e right and who Ã¾e wronge.â Than sayd Ã¾e emprowr âj the thanke, Whan j knowe who hath Ã¾e wranke, He shall passe by the dome That we nowe vse in Rome.â âTo morow, quod Ã¾e master, he shall tell Why the empryse wold hym quell.â âThat j desyre, sayd the kynge More than any other thynge.â The masters haue sped full well The child was kepte as it beffell. Whan Ã¾e empryse this hath harde, Full sore than she was afferde, Whan that child speke shuld, To shame he her brynge wold. The emprowr lett not for that, He went to bedde in good estate; All nyght he lay by his wyff, But she was dredfull of her lyff. In morowe rose the emprowr From his bed in gret honowr, To chirche he went and harde masse With his meynye more and lasse; Erles, barons, and knyghtes, To cowrt They com anon rightes, And all that myght theÃ¾er reke To here Ã¾e emprowrs son speke. The childes masters euerychon, Thether they com right anon. Whan don was all the masse, The emprowr to cowrt gan passe, And bade men shuld his son brynge Beffore hym withowt tarynge. Ffull well the child was dight, His colowr was ffayre and bryght, They browght Ã¾e child in to Ã¾e place Right beffore his ffaders face. The noyse of folk was very gret, Therfor he wold not spek yet. Whan the folk were all still, Than he myght be harde well, The first word he sayd with rewfull crie, âFfader haue on me marcye! Thow shalt knowe, yf thow wilt, Why Ã¾e empryse me wold haue spilte. A gret reason j haue for me Why j wold not speke to the. Myself and my masters all Sye that it was lyk to fall, Yf j hade spoken or this, Anon j had be dede, ywis, Ffor ye wold haue don by me As dide a man of gret poste, Ãat his son in to the see threwe Ffor a Cawse Ã¾e whiche he knewe, Ffor he sayd he shuld be richar knowen Than ever his fader was beforn.â Than sayd the emprowr âmy son dere, Thy tale fayn wold j here. Tell on, son, j pray Ã¾e, Anon, As thy masters beffore haue don. Euerych hath told a tale for the By cawse thow shuldest not dede be.â âSir, sayde Ã¾e child, j shall you tell, And no thynge to you lye j nell.â Fflorentes tale of Ã¾e two crowes and drenchyng of the childe. âTher was a man in this Contre That hade a child, full wise was he, Ffyftene wynter he was olde, A jentyll child and eke bolde. So on a day his ffader and he Togeder sayled in to the see. When they in Ã¾e see were lende, Two crowes satt on Ã¾e shippes ende, And so wondrely they longe gradde, That myche mervayll all they hadde. Than sayd Ã¾e fader as he satt, âLorde, what betokneth all that, That the crowes so longe crye? I know not what it may signyfye.â Than sayd his son to hym ywis âI know, fader, what Ã¾er crying is. They synge thus in ther stevyn That with Ã¾e grace of god in hevyn I shall so ryche a man be, That with your eyen ye shall se, That ye shall be redy ther to, Yf j will suffre you it to do, Whan j shall wasshe to hold Ã¾e basyn, While men giff me water Ã¾erin. And yet they synge more of me, As j shall now tell the: That my moder, withowt fayll, To me shall hold the towayll.â Than was the fader full wrothe, Anon his son was to hym lothe, And sayd to hym âsone, shalt thow Be of more degre than j am nowe?â âYe, sir, he sayd, for sothe, ywis, The Crowes synge Ã¾at trewth it is.â The ffader was in a badde thowght, And thowght his son to bryng to nowght; Anon he caste hym in to the see, And went hymself home ayee. Whan the child was in the flode, He eyled no thynge but goode, But jn all that he myght do, Jesu Criste he called to; And after that full sone Owr lorde harde the childes bone, Thorow his swete holy grace Browght hym to a drye place, Vpon a roche Ã¾at nygh hym was. Ffowr dayes ther he was, He had no Comfort of no thynge, But wild fowles Ã¾at he harde synge, That sayd to hym in ther songe âChild, thynk not this tym longe, Ffor god hath harde thy bone And the he will helpe full sone.â Anon after as it was godes will, The see was bothe fayre and still, A fissher com the rocke nygh, And sone Ã¾at yonge child he sigh; Anon he toke hym in to his bote, Glad he was of hym, god wote. He ladde hym to a castell stronge, Thirty myle thens longe, And ther he solde this child full well To the constable of the castell. Whan he had the child bowght, Into the castell he hym browght, Therin to dwell all his lyff. He loved hym well, so dide his wyff. In that tyme Ã¾er was a kynge, That was in full gret mornynge, Ffor iij ravens Ã¾at on hym gradde, That nyght ne day no pees he hade. He myght nother ride ne gon, But euer they Cryed hym vpon. All the men Ã¾at myght it see, Wondred why it shuld be. On a tyme the kyng bethowght And his cownsayll togeder he browght, Ffor to haue some wysyng What myght betoken that gretyng. Thyder com both baron and knyght And many a squyre full well dight; The Constable of the castell To the Cowrt com, the sothe to tell; The child prayed his master tho, That he myght with hym go. The master sayd âso mot j the, Gladly thow shalt go with me.â The kynges will for to here Fforth they went bothe in ffere. Whan they were to cowrt com, The barony all and some, The kyng than vp stode Amonge all his lordes in still mode, And sayd âlordynges, yf any of you Can tell the sothe nowe Why thes rauens make this Crye, I will hym for euer avauncy. He shall haue half my londe, And my ffayre dowghter by the honde, Ffor to haue her to his wyff, And all my londe after my lyff.â Whan the kynge had sayd his will, All the baronye satt full still; Non of them that were ther Therof cowld gyve hym non answere. Than sayd the child prevyly To his master full wisely âYf j myght speke with the kynge, I wolde hym tell his askynge.â The constable went to Ã¾e kynge anon As sone as he myght gon âI haue a childe, sir kynge, That will tell you your askynge, Yf ye will gyf hym your dowghter to wif And all your londe after your lyff.â âYes, sayd Ã¾e kynge, and more wyth all, Ffor he shall haue my goodes all, With that j may the sothe see What this mervayll myght be.â Than stode vp the child anon Beffore the barons euerychone, Hym behelde baron and knyght, For he was of hewe bryght. âLordynges, he sayd, echon, Ye se the rauen Ã¾at sittith alone: He is the formayle of thre, Ther of siker may ye be; And ye see the other twey, Ffor sothe tercellis bothe be they. This stryff hath laste yore, Therfor Ã¾e lesse Crieth on Ã¾e more. The gretter rauen Ã¾at yonder js The formaylle beffore had ywis. So it beffell this other yere That all thyng was full dere, Therfor he forsoke her tho, And she wyste not wheÃ¾er to go. Whan he had her forsake, The yonge rauen her tok to make, And hath her kepte to this day. Ffor no thyng he will let her a way, Tyll they ther dome of you see Who shall her trewe make be. Whan they know who shall be Ã¾er make, Ther flight a way they will take. And anon by the barons assent The kyng gaff rightfull jugement, And said he shuld her take, And kepe her Ã¾at was her make, In dere tyme that her toke, Whan her firste mak her forsoke. Whan Ã¾e elder raven of the two Harde the Dome yeven so, He made a gret Crye anon Wher at they wondred euerychon, And in gret sorow he flewe away, And never after non man hym say. The other raven and his make An other way he gan take, And ever as they dide fflo, They made eyther other gle. Whan the kyng had sene this, He made myche joy and blis. Anon beffore the barons all, That were than in the hall, He praysed myche the childes witt, And his seruyse well he quytt. As his first covenant was The kyng it helde in euery caas. His dowghter by the honde he nome, And gaf her to Ã¾e child with half his kyngdom, And whan he shuld forgo his lyff, He gaff all to hym and to his wyff. Vpon a day Ã¾e child bethowght Vpon his fader Ã¾at hym vp browght And also on his moder dere, That in pouerte ffallen were, And of Ã¾er londe they com sone, And in to ther sonnes londe they com, Ther as Ã¾er son was kynge, And they it wyste no thynge. Ther they levyd after longe, And full lytill they had to vnderfonge. On a tyme the kynge esspied that, Wher they dwellid and in what estate, Two seriantes he called anon, And badde them jn to the town gon To aske after suche a man That newe to the town cam Ffrom ferre contrey Ã¾er to won, That hight Gerard noryses sone. âYf ye may fynd hym ther, Byd them make Ã¾er chambre yare, With hym j will to morow dyne Wyth two knyghtes or thre of myne.â The seriantes anon forth went Thether as Ã¾er lorde them sent, And sayd withowt lesynge âYou greteth well owr lorde Ã¾e kynge By vs twayn Ã¾at be com in fere, That to morow he will dyne here.â âMy leve brother, sayd he, Welcom shall be Ã¾e kynge to me, But in hart j am sory That j haue no thynge redy, That me behoveth in all thynge For to serve with suche a kynge. All that j haue, lowde and still, Shall be at the kynges will.â A morowe whan Ã¾e kyng com was, His fader sayd âwelcom be your grace.â Anon as he was down light, His fader hym lade in anon right. Anon he wisshe his hondes ther In water which was fayre and clere; His knyghtes gaff water to hym, His ffader wold haue holden Ã¾e basyn, But he wolde not in no manere Suffre that it so were. Than cam his moder, withowt fayle, And browght forthe a ffayre towayll To wipe his hondes after his wasshynge, But he wold not suffre her for no thynge. A knyght of Ã¾e kynges that wasse ther The towayle to the kynge dide bere. Whan this wassheyng was all don, The kyng to his fader spak sone: âSire, he said, now ffallen ys, As j to you sayd or this, Whan j spak with you laste And was in to the ssee caste; Ffor j sayd j shuld be Richar man than ever were ye.â Whan his fader herde this, Sore he was afferde, ywis, To be hangid and to drawe, Or with som oÃ¾er payn slawe. But not for that they mad them glad With suche deyntes as they had. Ffader, thus ffare ye! Withowt reason ye wold haue slayn me I haue ben in paynes stronge And all together it was wronge No more gilty j than he That was caste in to the see. Thowgh j com to more honowr Then ye be in now, father emprowr, I will you never the more greve; Ther of ye may me well beleve. Nother for erneste ne for game, I will never wayte you no shame; But sothe it is your lady Desired j shuld haue layn her by, And for j wold not fulfill Her desyre and wykkyd will, Herselfe she all totare ywis, And bare in hond Ã¾at j dide this. All that she dide in her owtrage To put me from myn herytage. Withowt gilt j shuld haue ben slayn, Which had ben agayn Ã¾e lawe sertayn. Rather j wold to deth haue gon Than j that dede wold haue don. God it wote and owr lady, I badde her never vylany, But she me had bewyched soo That had j spok a worde or twoo Or that this day had be com, My lyff than she had nome. Of her self ye shall spye That j here of no worde lye.â âYs this soth?â sayd Ã¾e emperrowr then. âYe sire, he sayd, by all men.â The Emperowr sent for Ã¾e emperres And chargid her to tell how it was. She knowledged in all thynge Ãat she wold fayn his son to deth brynge, That my child myght haue ben Ã¾e eyre, Wherfor j am now in dispayre; And also sore j drede me That he wold haue distroyed the, Whan he to his age had come, And haue dreven Ã¾e owt of Rome And vndo all thyn honowr And haue made hym self emperowre Ffor this it was in my thought That j wold hym to deth haue browght. My lorde, on knees j pray the, This gilt Ã¾at thow wilt forgeve me.â âNay, said Ã¾e emprowr, by god almyght, I shall neuer forgeve the right. All thy knelyng is for nowght; By hym that me dere hath bowght, Ryght suche shall be thy jugement As thow to hym haddeste ment. Thow art beknowen affore vs all, Therfor a fowle deth on the shall fall.â The emperrowr called his tormentowrs, And comaundyd with gret furowrs To bynd her fast to a stake, And than a ffyre abowt her make, And brenne her for [t]he treason Ãa she dide to my son withowt reason. This was done with good will, And they stode never longe still. They made a fyre clere and bright, That was in many a mannes sight; A poste ther was in the mydward Which she was bownd to full harde; Than she right sore bowght The treason Ã¾at she beffore had sowght. In what Contrey Ã¾at man doth wende, Ever flashede hath evyll ende. Fflorent was ladde with gret honour With his ffather into Ã¾e towr, And lyved ther yeres longe In gret welth and myrth amonge. His masters had for ther lore And that they wold aske and more. After his fader he was kynge, And had right good endyng.

Thus endith of the vij sages of Rome which was drawen owt of crownycles and owt of wrytyng of old men and many a notable tale is therin as ye beffore sayde. Quod Richard Hill.</field>
