      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, FREDERIC, LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, PRIMATE OF ALL ENGLAND AND METROPOLITAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGONAUTICS OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS. BOOK I. THE ARGUMENT. This Book commences with the list and character of the Argonauts. Before they embark, two of the chiefs quarrel; but are pacified by the harmony of Orpheus. They set sail, and land at Lemnos, an island inhabited by female warriors; who, though they had slain their husbands and turned Amazons, are so charmed with these heroes, that they admit them to their beds. Thence they sail to the country of the Dolions, and are kindly received by their king Cyzicus. Loosing from thence in the night, and being driven back by contrary winds, they are mistaken for Pelasgians, with whom the Dolions were then at war. A battle ensues, in which Cyzicus and many of his men are slain. The morning discovers the unhappy mistake. Thence they sail to Mysia. Hercules breaks his oar; and while he is gone into a wood to make a new one, Hylas is stolen by a nymph, as he is stooping for water at a fountain. Hercules and Polyphemus go in search of him. Meanwhile the Argonauts leave them behind, and sail to Bithynia. Inspir'd by thee, O Phœbus, I resound The glorious deeds of heroes long renown'd, Whom Pelias urg'd the Golden Fleece to gain, And well-built Argo wafted o'er the main, Through the Cyanean rocks. The voice divine Pronounc'd this sentence from the sacred shrine; ‘Erelong, and dreadful woes, foredoom'd by fate, ‘Thro' that man's counsels shall on Pelias wait, ‘Whom he, before the altar of his God, ‘Shall view in public with one sandal shod.’ And, lo! as by this oracle foretold, What time adventurous Jason, brave and bold, Anaurus past, high swoln with winter's flood, He left one sandal rooted in the mud. To Pelias, thus, the hasty prince repair'd, And the rich banquet at his altar shar'd. The stately altar, with oblations stor'd, Was to his sire erected, ocean's lord, And every Power that in Olympus reigns, Save Juno, regent of Thessalia's plains. Pelias, whose looks his latent fears express'd, Fir'd with a bold adventure Jason's breast; That, sunk in ocean, or on some rude shore Prostrate, he ne'er might view his country more. Old bards affirm this warlike ship was made By skilful Argus, with Minerva's aid. 'Tis mine to sing the chiefs, their names and race, Their tedious wanderings on the main to trace, And all their great achievements to rehearse: Deign, ye propitious Nine, to aid my verse. First in the list, to join the princely bands, The tuneful bard, enchanting Orpheus, stands; Whom fair Calliope, on Thracia's shore, Near Pimpla's mount, to bold Œägrus bore. Hard rocks he soften'd with persuasive song, And sooth'd the rivers as they roll'd along. Yon beeches tall, that bloom near Zona, still Remain memorials of his vocal skill: His lays Pieria's listening trees admire, And move in measures to his melting lyre. Thus Orpheus charm'd, who o'er the Bistons reign'd, By Chiron's art to Jason's interest gain'd. Asterion next; whose sire rejoic'd to till Piresian valleys by Phylleion's hill, Born near Apidanus, who sportive leads His winding waters thro' the fertile meads; There where, from far, Enipeus, stream divine, And wide Apidanus their currents join. The son of Elatus, of deathless fame, From fair Larissa, Polyphemus came. Long since, when in the vigour of his might, He join'd the hardy Lapithæ in fight Against the Centaurs; now his strength declin'd Thro' age, yet young and martial was his mind. Not long at Phylace Iphiclus staid, Great Jason's uncle; pleas'd he join'd his aid, And march'd to meet th' adventurous band from far, Urg'd by affinity and love of war. Nor long Admetus, who at Pheræ reign'd, Near high Chalcodon's bleating fields remain'd, Echion, Erytus, for wiles renown'd, Left Alope, with golden harvests crown'd; The gainful sons of Mercury: with these Their brother came, the bold Æthalides; Whom fair Eupolema, the Phthian, bore Where smooth Amphrysos rolls his watery store: Those, Menetus, from thy fair daughter sprung, Antianira, beautiful and young. Coronus came, from Gyrton's wealthy town, Great as his sire in valour and renown, Cæneus his sire; who, as old bards relate, Receiv'd from Centaurs his untimely fate. Alone, unaided, with transcendent might, Boldly he fac'd, and put his foes to flight. But they, reviving soon, regain'd their ground; Yet fail'd to vanquish, and they could not wound. Unbroke, unmov'd, the chief his breath resigns, O'erwhelm'd beneath a monument of pines, From Titaresus Mopsus bent his way, Inspir'd an augur by the God of day. Eurydamas, to share fair honour's crown, Forsook near Xynias' lake his native town, Nam'd Ctimena: Menœtius join'd the band, Dismiss'd from Opuns by his sire's command. Next came Eurytion, Irus' valiant son, And Eribotes, seed of Teleon, Oïleus join'd these heroes, fam'd afar For stratagems and fortitude in war; Well skill'd the hostile squadrons to subdue, Bold in attack, and ardent to pursue. Next, by Canethus, son of Abans, sent, Ambitious Canthus from Eubœa went; Doom'd ne'er again to reach his native shore, Nor view the towers of proud Cerinthus more. For thus decreed the destinies severe, That he and Mopsus, venerable seer, After long toils and various wanderings past, On Afric's dreary coast should breathe their last. How short the term assign'd to human woe, Clos'd, as it is, by death's decisive blow! On Afric's dreary coast their graves were made, From Phasis distant far their bones were laid; Far as the east and western limits run, Far as the rising from the setting sun. Clytius and Iphitus unite their aid, Who all the country round Œchalia sway'd; These were the sons of Eurytus the proud, On whom his bow the God of day bestow'd; But he, devoid of gratitude, defy'd, And challeng'd Phœbus with a rival's pride. The sons of Æacus, intrepid race! Separate advanc'd, and from a different place. For when their brother unawares they slew, From fair Ægina diverse they withdrew. Fair Salamis king Telamon obey'd, And valiant Peleus Phthia's sceptre sway'd: Next Butes came from fam'd Cecropia far. Brave Teleon's son, a chief renown'd in war. To wield the deadly lance Phalerus boasts, Who, by his sire commission'd, joins the hosts: No son, save this, e'er bless'd the hoary sage, And this heaven gave him in declining age: Yet him he sent, disdaining abject fears, To shine conspicuous 'midst his gallant peers. Theseus, far more than all his race renown'd, Fast in the cave of Tænarus was bound With adamantine fetters, (dire abode!) E'er since he trod th' irremeable road With his belov'd Pirithoüs: had they sail'd, Much had their might, their courage much avail'd. Bœotian Tiphys came, experienc'd well Old ocean's foaming surges to foretell, Experienc'd well the stormy winds to shun, And steer his vessel by the stars, or sun. Minerva urg'd him by her high command, A welcome mate to join the princely band. For she the ship had form'd with heavenly skill, Tho' Argus wrought the dictates of her will. Thus plann'd, thus fashion'd, this fam'd ship excell'd The noblest ships by oar or sail impell'd. From Aræthyrea, that near Corinth lay, Phlias, the son of Bacchus, bent his way: Bless'd by his sire, his splendid mansion stood Fast by the fountains of Asopus' flood. From Argos next the sons of Bias came, Areius, Talaus, candidates for fame, With bold Leodocus, whom Pero bore, Neleus' fair daughter, on the Argive shore; For whom Melampus various woes sustain'd, In a deep dungeon by Iphiclus chain'd. Next Hercules, endued with dauntless mind, At Jason's summons, stay'd not long behind. For warn'd of this adventurous band, when last The chief to Argos from Arcadia past, (What time in chains he brought the living boar, The dread, the bane of Erymanthia's moor, And at the gate of proud Mycenæ's town, From his broad shoulders hurl'd the monster down:) Unask'd the stern Mycenian king's consent, Instant to join the warlike host he went. Young Hylas waited with obsequious care, The hero's quiver and his bow to bear. Next came, the list of demigods to grace, He who from Danaüs deriv'd his race, Nauplius; of whom fam'd Prætus was the son, Of Prætus Lernus; thus the lineage run: From Lernus Naubolus his being claim'd, Whose valiant son was Clytoneüs nam'd. In navigation's various arts confess'd Shone Nauplius' skill, superior to the rest: Him to the sea's dread lord, in days of yore, Danaüs' fair daughter, Amymone bore. Last of those chiefs who left the Grecian coast, Prophetic Idmon join'd the gallant host; (Full well he knew what cruel fate ordain'd; But dreaded more than death his honour stain'd) The son of Phœbus by some stolen embrace, And number'd too with Æolus's race, He learn'd his art prophetic from his sire, Omens from birds and prodigies from fire. Illustrious Pollux, fam'd for martial force, And Castor, skill'd to guide the rapid horse, Ætolian Leda sent from Sparta's shore: Both at one birth in Tyndarus' house she bore. No boding fears her generous mind depress'd; She thought like them whom Jove's embrace had bless'd. Lynceus and Idas, from Arene's wall, Heard fame's loud summons, and obey'd her call: The sons of Aphareus, of matchless might, But Lynceus stands renown'd for piercing sight: So keen his beam, that ancient fables tell, He saw, thro' earth, the wondrous depths of hell. With these bold Periclymenus appears, The son of Neleus, most advanc'd in years Of all his race; his sire's unconquer'd pride: Him with vast strength old ocean's lord supply'd, And gave the power, when hard in battle press'd, To take whatever form might suit him best. From Tegea's towers, where bore Aphidas sway, Amphidamas and Cepheus took their way, The sons of Aleus both; and with them went Ancæus, by his sire Lycurgus sent. Of those the brother, and by birth the first, Was good Lycurgus; tenderly he nurs'd His sire at home; but bade his gallant son With the bold chiefs the race of glory run. On his broad back a bear's rough spoils he wore, And in his hand a two-edg'd pole-axe bore, Which, that the youth might in no danger share, Were safe secreted by his grandsire's care. Augeas too, lord of the Elean coast, Sail'd, brave associate, with the warlike host. Rich in possessions, of his riches proud, Fame says his being to the Sun he ow'd. Ardent he wish'd to see the Colchian shore, And old Æeta who the sceptre bore. Asterius and Amphion, urg'd by fame, The valiant sons of Hyperasius, came From fair Pellene, built in days of yore By Pelle's grandsire on the lofty shore. From Tænarus, that yawns with gulf profound, Euphemus came, for rapid race renown'd. By Neptune forc'd, Europa gave him birth, Daughter to Tityus, hugest son of Earth. Whene'er he skimm'd along the watery plain, With feet unbath'd he swept the surging main, Scarce brush'd the surface of the briny dew, And light along the liquid level flew. Two other sons of Neptune join'd the host, This from Miletus on th' Ionian coast, Erginus nam'd, but that from Samos came, Juno's lov'd isle, Ancæus was his name; Illustrious chiefs, and both renown'd afar For the joint arts of sailing and of war. Young Meleager, Œneus' warlike son, And sage Laocoon march'd from Calydon. From the same father he and Œneus sprung; But on the breasts of different mothers hung. Him Œneus purpos'd with his son to send, A wise companion, and a faithful friend. Thus to the royal chiefs his name he gave, And green in years was number'd with the brave. Had he continu'd but one summer more A martial pupil on th' Ætolian shore, First on the lists of fame the youth had shone, Or own'd superior Hercules alone. His uncle too, well-skill'd the dart to throw, And in th' embattled plain resist the foe, Iphiclus, venerable Thestius' son, Join'd the young chief, and boldly led him on. The son of Lernus, Palæmonius, came, Olenian Lernus; but the voice of fame Whispers, that Vulcan was the hero's sire, And therefore limps he like the God of fire. Of nobler port or valour none could boast; He added grace to Jason's godlike host. From Phocis Iphitus with ardour press'd To join the chiefs; great Jason was his guest, When to the Delphic Oracle he went, Consulting fate, and anxious for th' event. Zetes and Calaïs of royal race, Whom Orithyïa bore in wintry Thrace To blustering Boreas in his airy hall, Heard fame's loud summons, and obey'd the call. Erectheus, who th' Athenian sceptre sway'd, Was parent of the violated maid, Whom dancing with her mates rude Boreas stole, Where the fam'd waters of Ilissus roll; And to his rock-fenc'd Sarpedonian cave Convey'd her, where Erginus pours his wave: There, circumfus'd in gloom and grateful shade, The god of tempests woo'd the gentle maid. They, when on tip-toe rais'd, in act to fly, Like the light-pinion'd vagrants of the sky, Wav'd their dark wings, and, wondrous to behold! Display'd each plume distinct with drops of gold; While down their backs, of bright cerulean hue, Loose in the winds their wanton tresses flew. Not long with Pelias young Acastus stay'd; He left his sire to lend the Grecians aid. Argus, whom Pallas with her gifts inspir'd, Follow'd his friend, with equal glory fir'd. Such the compeers of Jason highly fam'd; And all these demigods were Minyans nam'd. The most illustrious heroes of the host Their lineage from the seed of Minyas boast: For Minyas' daughter, Clymena the fair, Alcimeda, great Jason's mother, bare. When all was furnish'd by the busy band Which vessels destin'd for the main demand; The heroes from Iölcos bent their way To the fam'd port, the Pagasæan bay, And deep-environ'd with thick-gathering crowds, They shone like stars resplendent thro' the clouds. Then thus among the rout, with wondering look, Some swain survey'd the bright-arm'd chiefs and spoke: ‘Say, what can Pelias, mighty Jove, intend, ‘Far, far from Greece so great a force to send! ‘Sure, should Æeta spurn the sons of Greece, ‘And to their claims refuse the golden Fleece, ‘That self-same day shall see his palace, crown'd ‘With glittering turrets, levell'd to the ground. ‘But endless toils pursue them as they go, ‘And Fate hath mark'd their desperate steps with woe.’ Thus, when he saw the delegated bands, Spoke the rude swain with heaven-uplifted hands: The gentler females thus the Gods implore; “Safe may they reach again their native shore:” And thus some matron mild her mind express'd; (Tears in her eye, and terrors at her breast) ‘Unfortunate Alcimeda, thy fate ‘Now frowns malignant, tho' it frowns so late; ‘Nor wills the tenor of thy life to run ‘Serene and peaceful, as it first begun. ‘On Æson too attend unnumber'd woes; ‘Far, better far, a lingering life to close, ‘And bury all his sorrows in the tomb, ‘Unconscious of calamities to come. ‘Oh! had both Phrixus and the ram been drown'd, ‘When Helle perish'd in the gulf profound: ‘But the dire monster was with voice endu'd, ‘And human accents from his mouth ensu'd, ‘To sad Alcimeda denouncing strife, ‘And woes to cloud the evening of her life.’ Thus spoke some matron as the heroes went; Around their lords the menial train lament: Alcimeda embrac'd her son with tears, Each breast was chill'd with sad presaging fears. Age-drooping Æson heard the general moan, Wrapp'd in soft robes, and answer'd groan for groan. But Jason sooths their fears, their bosom warms, And bids his servants bring the burnish'd arms. They, with a downcast look and lowly bow, Obey their chief with silent steps and slow. The pensive Queen, while tears bedew her face, Her son still circles with a fond embrace. Thus to her nurse an infant orphan springs, And weeps unceasing as she closely clings; Experienc'd insults make her loath to stay Beneath a step-dame's proud, oppressive sway. Thus in her royal breast the sorrows pent Forc'd sighs and tears, and struggled for a vent. Still in her arms she held her favourite son, And comfortless with faltering speech begun: ‘Oh had I died on that detested day, ‘And with my sorrows sigh'd my soul away, ‘When Pelias publish'd his severe decree, ‘Severe and fatal to my son and me! ‘Thyself had then my aged eyelids clos'd, ‘And those dear hands my decent limbs compos'd; ‘This boon alone I wish'd thee to impart, This wish alone lay dormant at my heart. ‘But now, alas! tho' first of Grecian names, ‘Admir'd and envy'd by Thessalian dames, ‘I, like an hand-maid, now am left behind, ‘Bereav'd of all tranquillity of mind. ‘By thee rever'd, in dignity I shone, ‘And first and last for thee unloos'd my zone. ‘For unrelenting hate Lucina bore, ‘Thee, one lov'd son, she gave, but gave no more. ‘Alas! not ev'n the visions of the night ‘Foretold such fatal woes from Phrixus' flight.’ Thus mourn'd Alcimeda; her handmaids hear, Sigh back her sighs, and answer tear with tear. Then Jason these consoling words address'd, To sooth the rising anguish of her breast: “Cease, mother, cease excess of grief to show, “Oh! cease this wild extravagance of woe. “Tears cannot make one dire disaster less; “They cherish grief, and aggravate distress. “Wisely and justly have the Gods assign'd “Unthought-of miseries to all mankind. “The lot they give you, tho' perchance severe, “Confiding in Minerva, bravely bear. “Minerva first this bold adventure mov'd, “Apollo, and the Oracles approv'd. “These calls of heaven our confidence command, “Join'd with the valour of this princely band. “Haste, royal mother, to your native tow'rs, “Pass with your handmaids there the peaceful hours. “Forebode not here calamities to come: “Your female train will re-conduct you home.” He spoke; and from the palace bent his way, Graceful of port; so moves the god of day At Delos, from his odour-breathing fanes, Or Claros situate on Ionian plains, Or Lycia's ample shores, where Xanthus leads His winding waters thro' irriguous meads. Thus Jason march'd majestic thro' the crowd, And Fame auspicious rais'd her voice aloud: When lo! the priestess of Diana came, Their guardian Goddess, Iphias was her name, Bending with age, and kiss'd the chief's right hand; In vain she wish'd to speak; the hasty band With speedy footsteps from the dame withdrew, And Jason mingled with his valiant crew. Then from the tower-fenc'd town he bent his way, And reach'd ere long the Pagasæan bay; There join'd his comrades waiting on the coast, And there saluted his confederate host. When from Iölcos, lo, the wondering train Observe Acastus hastening o'er the plain, And with him Argus, his compeer and friend; Unknown to Pelias, to the ship they tend. Argus around his brawny shoulders flung A bull's black spoils that to his ancles hung. Acastus wore a mantle rich and gay, Wrought by his sister, lovely Pelopa. Thus rob'd, the chiefs approach'd the crowded shore; Illustrious Jason stay'd not to explore What cause so long detain'd them, but commands To council all the delegated bands. On shrouds and sails that cover'd half the beach, And the tall, tapering mast, in order each, The heroes sat; then rising o'er the rest, His bold associates Jason thus address'd: ‘Since now the stores lie ready on the strand, ‘And since our chiefs and arms are all at hand, ‘No longer let us waste the golden day, ‘But the first summons of the breeze obey. ‘And, since we all with equal ardour burn ‘For Colchian spoils, and hope a safe return, ‘Impartial choose some hero fam'd afar ‘To guide the vessel, and conduct the war, ‘Let him, your sovereign chief, with foreign foes ‘The terms of treaty, and of fight propose.’ He spoke; with earnest eyes the youthful band Mark bold Alcides for supreme command; On him with voice unanimous they call, Own him their leader, and the lord of all. In the mid circle sat the godlike man, His broad right hand he wav'd, and thus began: “Let none to me this arduous task assign, “For I the glory with the charge decline. “Jason alone shall lead this valiant band, “The chief who rais'd it, let that chief command.” Thus briefly spoke th' unconquerable man; Loud approbation thro' the circle ran: Then Jason rose, (complacence fill'd his breast) And thus the pleas'd, attentive throng address'd: ‘Friends and associates, since your wills decree ‘This great, this honourable trust to me, ‘No longer be our enterprize delay'd: ‘To Phœbus first be due oblations paid; ‘Let then a short repast our strength renew: ‘And, till my herdsmen to our gallant crew ‘With beeves return, the best my stalls contain, ‘Strive we to launch our vessel in the main. ‘And when close stow'd our military stores, ‘Each take his post, and ply the nimble oars. ‘To Phœbus first, Embasian Phœbus, raise ‘The smoaking altar; let the victims blaze. ‘He promis'd, if due rites to him I pay, ‘To point thro' ocean's paths our dubious way.’ He said, and instant to the task he flew; Example fir'd his emulative crew. They heap'd their vestments on a rock, that stood Far from the insults of the roaring flood, But, in times past, when wintry storms prevail'd, Th' encroaching waves its towering top assail'd. As Argus counsel'd, with strong ropes they bound, Compacting close, the vessel round and round; Then with stout nails the sturdy planks they join'd, To brave the fury of the waves or wind: Next delv'd with spades a channel deep and wide, Thro' which the ship might launch into the tide. Near to the water deeper was the way, Where wooden cylinders transversely lay; On these they heav'd the vessel from the plain, To roll her, smoothly-gliding, to the main. Then to the benches, tapering oars they fix'd; A cubit's measure was the space betwixt: This was the station for the labouring bands, To tug with bending breasts, and out-stretch'd hands. First Tiphys mounted on th' aerial prow To issue orders to the train below, That at his word, their strength uniting, all Might join together, and together haul. With eager look th' attentive heroes stand, And wait impatient till he gave command; Then all at once, with full exerted sway, They move her from the station where she lay, And pushing instant, as the pilot guides, On smooth round rollers Pelian Argo glides; Glibly she glides; loud shouts the jovial band; They haul, they pull, they push her from the strand. Beneath the huge hulk groan the rollers strong; Black smoke arises as she moves along; With swift descent she rushes to the main: Coercive ropes her rapid race restrain. Then, next, their sails they hoisted, fix'd their oars, The mast erected, and embark'd the stores. By lots on benches were the heroes plac'd, And with two heroes every bench was grac'd. On great Alcides, formidable name, And on Ancæus, who from Tegea came, With voice unanimous, the martial host Bestow'd the centre's honourable post. To watchful Tiphys was the helm assign'd, To stem the waves, and catch the favouring wind. This done, with stones beside the shore which lay, They rear'd an altar to the God of day, Embasian Phœbus, and the surface round With the dry branches of an olive crown'd. Meanwhile the herdsmen drove two beeves well fed From Jason's stalls; youths to the altar led The victims; some brought water from the lake; Some the due offering of the salted cake. Jason, while these the sacrifice prepare, Thus to his parent God prefers his pray'r: ‘Patron of Pagasæ, thine ear we claim, ‘Guard of the city grac'd with Æson's name: ‘When to consult thine oracle I went, ‘It promis'd to reveal this great event, ‘The final issue of our bold emprise: ‘On thee, chief author, all our hope relies. ‘Conduct my comrades to the far-fam'd Fleece, ‘Then safe restore them to the realms of Greece. ‘And here I vow, whatever chiefs return, ‘So many bulls shall on thine altar burn; ‘A sacrifice at Delphos is decreed, ‘And in Ortygia shall the victims bleed. ‘But now these humble offerings which we pay, ‘Gracious accept, far-darting God of day. ‘Be thou, O father, our auspicious guide, ‘When hence we sail across the sounding tide. ‘Smooth the rough billows, and let breezes bland ‘Propitious waft us to the Colchian land.’ Thus pray'd he suppliant, and prepar'd to make The sacred offering of the salted cake. Alcides, fam'd for manly strength and sway, And bold Ancæus rose the beeves to slay. Alcides' club impress'd a deadly wound On the steer's front, and fell'd him to the ground. Thy axe, Ancæus, at one sturdy stroke, The steer's skull fractur'd, and the neck-bone broke, Down fell the victim, floundering with the blow, Prone on his horns, and plough'd the sand below. The ready train, that round in order stood, Stab the fallen beeves, and shed the life-warm blood; Then from the body strip the smoaking hide, The beasts they quarter, and the joints divide; The thighs devoted to the Gods they part, On these the fat, involv'd in cawls, with art They spread, and as the lambent flame devours, The Grecian chief the pure libation pours. Joy fill'd the breast of Idmon to behold, How from the thighs the flame relucent roll'd In purple volumes, and propitious smoke; And thus the seer, inspir'd by Phœbus, spoke: ‘Tho' various perils your attempt oppose, ‘And toils unnumber'd bring unnumber'd woes; ‘Yet shall ye safe return, ye sons of Greece, ‘Adorn'd with conquest, and the golden Fleece. ‘Me cruel Fate ordains on Asia's shore ‘To die, nor e'er behold my country more. ‘And tho' my destiny long fix'd I knew, ‘Yet, still resolv'd, I join'd the martial crew; ‘Inflam'd with glory to the host I came, ‘Of life regardless, emulous of fame.’ Thus he; the host the fate of Idmon mourn, But joy transports them for their wish'd return. The sun, remitting now his fiercer ray, Pours from the west the faint remains of day: Low as he sinks, the lofty rocks expand Their lengthen'd shadows o'er the distant land. On leafy couches now the warlike train Repose along the beach that skirts the main. Before the chiefs are savoury viands plac'd, And generous wines, delicious to the taste. The hours in mutual converse they employ, In festive songs and undissembled joy. Thus at the banquet sport the young and gay, When Mirth breaks in, and Envy skulks away. But not unmark'd was Jason's pensive look; Idas beheld him, and licentious spoke: ‘What doubts, what fears do Æson's son perplex? ‘What dangers fright him, and what sorrows vex? ‘Proclaim thy thoughts: or is thy dubious mind ‘Dismay'd with terrours of the dastard kind? ‘Now by this stout, unconquer'd lance, I swear, ‘On which in war victorious wreaths I bear, ‘(Scorning from Jove's assistance to receive ‘Those palms, which this resistless lance can give) ‘No foes shall brave, no wiles of war withstand, ‘Tho' Jove frown adverse, this impetuous hand. ‘Such Idas is, for prowess fam'd afar, ‘Arene's boast, the thunder-bolt of war.’ This said, the boaster seiz'd a goblet, fill'd With racy wine, and to the bottom swill'd. O'er his black beard and cheeks the liquor flow'd: Th' assembled host with indignation glow'd. Then Idmon rose and boldly thus reply'd: “Vain wretch! to brand our leader and our guide; “And more irreverent still, thus flush'd with wine, “To dare reproach superior powers divine. “Far different speech must cheer the social train; “Thy words are brutish, and thy boasts are vain. “Thus, fame reports, the Aloïdæ strove “Long since to irritate the powers above “By vile aspersions, infamously free; “Yet they in valour far exceeded thee. “Slain by the shafts of Phœbus, down they fell, “Tho' high aspiring, to the depths of Hell.” He said; but Idas, with sarcastic sneer, Laughing, provok'd the venerable feer: ‘Declare, wise augur, if the Gods decree, ‘The same perdition shall be hurl'd on me, ‘Which fam'd Aloëus' impious sons befell ‘When slain by Phœbus, and condemn'd to hell. ‘Meantime escape, or manfully withstand, ‘Vain seer, the fury of this vengeful hand.’ Thus Idas spoke, impatient of controul, And rising rage inflam'd his fiery soul; Nor had they here ceas'd fiercely to contest, But Jason and his friends their wrath repress'd. 'Twas then, the jarring heroes to compose, Th' enchanting bard, Oeagrian Orpheus rose, And thus, attuning to the trembling strings His soothing voice, of harmony he sings: “How at the first, beneath chaotic sway, “Heaven, earth and sea in wild disorder lay; “Till nature parted the conflicting foes, “And beauteous order from confusion rose. “How in yon bright etherial fields above “The lucid stars in constant orbits move; “How the pale queen of night and golden sun, “Thro' months, and years their radiant journeys run: “Whence rose the mountains, clad with waving woods, “The crystal founts, and hoarse-resounding floods, “With all their nymphs; from what celestial seed “Springs the vast species of the serpent breed: “How o'er the new-created world below, “On high Olympus' summits crown'd with snow, “Ophion, and, from ocean sprung of old, “The fair Eurynome reign'd uncontroll'd: “How haughty Saturn, with superior sway “Exil'd Ophion from the realms of day; “Eurynome before proud Rhea fled, “And how both sunk in ocean's billowy bed. “Long time they rul'd the blest Titanian Gods, “While infant Jove possess'd the dark abodes “Of Dictè's cave; yet uninform'd his mind “With heavenly wisdom, and his hand confin'd. “Forg'd by earth's giant sons, with livid rays “Flam'd not as yet the lightning's piercing blaze; “Nor roar'd the thunder thro' the realms above, “The strength and glory of almighty Jove.” Here the sweet bard his tuneful lyre unstrung, And ceas'd the heavenly music of his tongue; But, with the sound entranc'd, the listening ear Still thought him singing, and still seem'd to hear: In silent rapture every chief remains, And feels within his heart the thrilling strains. Forthwith the bowl they crown with rosy wine, And pay due honours to the powers divine; Then on the flaming tongues libations pour, And wait salubrious sleep's composing hour. Soon as the bright-ey'd morning's splendid ray On Pelion's summit pour'd the welcome day, Light skimm'd the breezes o'er the liquid plain, And gently swell'd the fluctuating main; Then Tiphys rose, and, summon'd by his care, Embark the heroes, and their oars prepare. Portentous now along the winding shores Hoarse sounding Pagasæan Neptune roars: From Pelian Argo's keel loud murmurs broke, Urgent to sail; the keel of sacred oak, Endu'd with voice, and marvellously wrought, Itonian Pallas from Dodona brought. Now on their destin'd posts, arrang'd along, In seemly order sat the princely throng; Fast by each chief his glittering armour flames: The midmost station bold Ancæus claims, With great Alcides, (whose enormous might Arm'd with a massy club provokes the fight,) Close plac'd beside him: in the yielding flood The keel deep-sinking owns the demigod. Their hausers now they loose, and on the brine To Neptune pour the consecrated wine: Then from his native shore sad Jason turns His oft-reverted eye, and silent mourns. As in Ortygia, or the Delphic fane, Or where Ismenus laves Bœotia's plain, Apollo's altar round, the youthful quire, The dance according with the sounding lyre, The hallow'd ground with equal cadence beat, And move in measure their alternate feet; Together so Thessalia's princes sweep With well-tim'd oars the silver-curling deep: While, raising high the Thracian harp, presides Melodious Orpheus, and the movement guides. Dash'd by their oars the foaming billows broke, And loud remurmur'd to each mighty stroke. Swift sail'd the ship, the sun refulgent beam'd, And bright as flame their glittering armour gleam'd. While to their outstretch'd oars the heroes bow, The parted ocean whitening foams below. So shines the path, along some grassy plain, Worn by the footsteps of the village-swain. Th' immortal powers that Jove's proud palace crown, All on that memorable day look'd down, The godlike chiefs and Argo to survey, As thro' the deep they urg'd their daring way. Then too on Pelion's cloud-capt summit stood The Nymphs that wander in that sacred wood; Wondering they view'd below the sailing pine, (Itonian Pallas fram'd the work divine) And bold Thessalia's labouring heroes sweep With stretching oars the navigable deep. Lo! from the mountain's topmost cliff descends The Centaur Chiron; to the shore he bends His hasty footsteps: on the beach he stood, And dipp'd his fetlocks in the hoary flood. He hail'd the heroes with his big, broad hand, And wish'd them safe to gain their native land. With Chiron came Chariclo to the shore; The young Achilles in her arms she bore. Peleus, his sire, with secret pleasure smil'd, As high in air she rais'd the royal child. And now the winding bay's safe precincts past, Thessalian Argo plough'd the watery waste; On Tiphys' care the valiant chiefs rely'd, To steer the vessel o'er the foaming tide, The smooth well-modell'd rudder to command, Obsequious to the movement of his hand. And next inserting in the keel below The mast tall-tapering, to the stern and prow, With ropes that thro' the rolling pulleys glide, They rear upright, and firm on every side. Then high in air the swelling sails they raise, While on their bosoms buxom Zephyr plays. With favouring gales their steady course they keep To where Tisæum frowns upon the deep. Meanwhile sweet Orpheus, as they sail'd along, Rais'd to Diana the melodious song, Who sav'd them, where her guardian power presides, From treacherous rocks that lurk beneath the tides. The fish in shoals, attentive to his lay, Pursu'd the poet o'er the watery way; And oft emerging from their liquid sphere, Strove more distinct his heavenly notes to hear. As sheep in flocks thick-pasturing on the plain Attend the footsteps of the shepherd-swain, His well-known call they hear, and fully fed, Pace slowly on, their leader at their head; Who pipes melodious, as he moves along, On sprightly reeds his modulated song: Thus charm'd with tuneful sounds, the scaly train Pursu'd the flying vessel o'er the main. And now the winds with favouring breezes blew, Corn-crown'd Thessalia lessen'd to the view, The Grecian heroes pass by Pelion's steep, Whose rocky summit nodded o'er the deep. Now Sepias' cliffs beneath the waves subside, And sea-girt Sciathos surmounts the tide. Next, but far distant, was Piresiæ seen, (Built on Magnesia's continent serene) And Dolops' tomb, for this pacific shore, Blest with mild evening's soften'd gales, they bore. To him with victims was an altar crown'd, While night prevail'd, and ocean roar'd around. Two days they tarried, till propitious gales Rose with the third, and bellied all their sails. Assiduous then, the well-known shore they fill, The shore call'd Aphetæ of Argo still. Next Melibœa, on Thessalia's shore, They pass, where winds and thundering tempests roar. At early dawn, incumbent o'er the deep, They view high Omole's aspiring steep. Next by the streams of Amyrus they steer, And where thy vales, Eurymena, appear, And Ossa and Olympus' shady brow; Loud from deep caverns gush the waves below. By night beside Pallene's heights they sail, And rough Canastra frowning o'er the vale. But when the morn display'd her orient light, Tall Athos rose conspicuous to the sight; Which tho' from Lemnos far remov'd it lay, As far as ships can sail till noon of day, Yet the proud mountain's high-exalted head, A gloom umbrageous o'er Myrina spread. All day till eve the soft, indulgent gales Their succour lent, and fill'd the swelling sails. But when with eve the breezes ceas'd to blow, The mariners to Sintian Lemnos row, Ill-fated island! where the female train Had all the males, the year preceding, slain. For, deep-enamour'd with the nymphs of Thrace, The men declin'd the conjugal embrace; Their wives they slighted, and unwary led War's pleasing spoils, fair captives, to their bed. For angry Venus robb'd of love's delights The Lemnian females, for neglected rites. Ah miserable train! with envy curs'd And jealousy, of passions far the worst! One fatal night this unrelenting crew Their mates, and all the lovely captives, slew, And every male; lest in the course of time Should rise some hero to revenge the crime. Hypsipyla alone, illustrious maid, Spar'd her sire Thoas, who the sceptre sway'd. With pious care, in reverence to his age, In a capacious ark she plac'd the sage, Confiding in the mercy of the wave The monarch from the massacre to save. Some faithful fishers, to their mandate just, Convey'd with care the delegated trust Safe to a neighbouring, sea-surrounded shore, Œnœa nam'd, so nam'd in days of yore, Now Sicinum; from Sicinus it takes Its title, whom a naiad of the lakes, The nymph Œnœa, beautiful and fair, Compress'd by Thoas, to the monarch bare. The widow'd Lemnians, tho' by waves secur'd, Oft shone in arms, to martial toils inur'd. To feed their cattle was their daily care, Or cleave the furrow with the crooked share: Expert at these, Minerva's arts they scorn'd, Which once employ'd them, and which once adorn'd. Oft to the main, oppress'd with dire alarms, They look'd; for much they fear'd the Thracian arms. And when Thessalian Argo caught their view, Quick from Myrina to the shore they flew. All clad in glittering arms they press'd the strand, Impetuous; (like the Bacchanalian band, When with raw flesh their horrid feasts they close;) They deem'd the vessel stor'd with Thracian foes. Hypsipyla advanc'd among the rest, In the bright armour of her father dress'd; Anxious, astonish'd all the dames appear, And by their silence testified their fear. Meanwhile Æthalides the heroes send; To him their peaceful mandates they commend. Invested with the office of the God, They grace their herald too with Hermes' rod, Hermes his sire; who bless'd his favourite heir With memory nor time, nor place impair. In vain around him Acheron's waters roll; They pour no dull oblivion o'er his soul. To him the fates this privilege bestow, By turns to wander with the shades below; By turns with men to view the golden day, And feel the sun's invigorating ray. But why expatiate on such themes as these? Why tell the fame of great Æthalides? The herald to Hypsipyla address'd, With mild benevolence, this joint request; That now, at evening-close, the friendly land Might hospitably treat this gallant band, Who fear'd at morn to hoist their swelling sails, For Boreas blew with unpropitious gales. The queen had summon'd to the council-hall The Lemnian dames, the dames obey'd her call: Who mildly, with persuasion in her look, In order rang'd, the heroines bespoke: ‘Let us, my mates, and ye my words attend, ‘Commodious presents to these strangers send; ‘Such as their friends to mariners consign, ‘Salubrious viands, and delicious wine; ‘So will they peaceful on our borders stay, ‘Nor need compel them to the town to stray. ‘Here will they learn the story of our guilt, ‘The vows we broke, the kindred blood we spilt; ‘And sure a tale, thus horrid, must appear ‘Cruel and impious to a foreign ear. ‘These are the counsels of your faithful friend, ‘Prompt to advise, and steady to defend. ‘She who can furnish counsel more discreet, ‘Now let her offer—for this cause we meet.’ Thus spoke the queen, and press'd her father's throne, A royal seat, compos'd of solid stone. Then rose Polyxo, venerable dame, Once the queen's nurse, oppress'd with age, and lame; A staff sustain'd her (for her limbs were weak) Tottering with age, yet vehement to speak. Near her four damsels, blooming, fresh and fair, Sat crown'd with ringlets of the whitest hair. Full in the midst she stood, then rais'd her head, Her back was bent with years, and thus she said: ‘The queen's advice I greatly must commend, ‘Commodious presents to our guests to send. ‘And what more saving counsel shall I give ‘To those my friends who shall hereafter live; ‘Whene'er the sons of Thrace, or hostile hosts ‘From other kingdoms shall infest our coasts; ‘Which well may happen, we must all allow, ‘As this invasion that alarms us now? ‘But should some God avert th' impending ill, ‘Yet greater evils may befall, and will. ‘For when the oldest die, as die they must, ‘And our wise matrons be transform'd to dust, ‘And you, now young, oppress'd at last with age, ‘Shall unprolific tread life's irksome stage: ‘What wretched mortals ye, who then survive! ‘Who to their labour, then, the steers shall drive? ‘Will oxen then their necks spontaneous bow ‘Beneath the yoke, and drag the ponderous plough? ‘Or will they reap the harvest on the plain, ‘And every autumn house the golden grain? ‘I, tho' preserv'd to this important day, ‘(For death from me abhorrent turns away,) ‘Yet, ere the sun compleats his annual round, ‘If right I judge, shall mingle with the ground, ‘Lodg'd in the lap of Earth, at Nature's call, ‘And 'scape the ruin that involves you all. ‘Hear then, young damsels, what my years advise; ‘Before you now the fair occasion lies: ‘Commit your city to these strangers' care, ‘Let them your mansions and possessions share.’ She spoke, pleas'd murmurs fill'd the spacious hall; Polyxo's counsel was approv'd by all. From her sire's throne Hypsipyla arose, Thus in few words the conference to close: “My mates, since all this sage advice commend, “An instant message to the ship I send.” She said, and to Iphinoa gave command; “Haste, find the leader of yon martial band, “Invite him (of our amity a proof) “To lodge beneath my hospitable roof; “There time will furnish leisure to relate “The genius and the manners of our state. “But let his comrades rove, as pleasure leads, “And pitch their tents along the fertile meads; “Or to the tower-defended town repair, “Assur'd of safety, and our royal care.” Th' assembly rose, as thus the princess spoke, Then to the regal dome her way she took. Iphinoa, mindful of the queen's command, Approach'd the Minyans scatter'd o'er the strand, Who throng'd around her, eager to explore Wherefore she came, and what commands she bore. Then thus she said; ‘Strangers, to you as friends ‘Hypsipyla, the seed of Thoas, sends ‘Her faithful herald, with this strict command ‘To find the leader of your martial band; ‘Him she invites (of amity a proof) ‘To lodge beneath her hospitable roof: ‘There time will furnish leisure to relate ‘The genius, and the manners of our state. ‘But let his comrades rove, as pleasure leads, ‘And pitch their tents along the fertile meads; ‘Or to the tower-defended town repair, ‘Assur'd of safety, and the royal care.’ These words were grateful to the warlike band; From her they learn'd whose sceptre rul'd the land; Instant they urg'd their chief's assent, and all Prepar'd obsequious to accept the call. A mantle doubly lin'd, of purple hue, The son of Æson o'er his shoulders threw. This Pallas gave him, when, with wondrous art, She plann'd his ship, and measur'd every part. 'Twere safer to survey the radiant globe Of rising Phœbus, than this splendid robe. Full in the middle beam'd a crimson blaze, The verge surrounding darted purple rays. In every part historic scenes were wrought; The moving figures seem'd inform'd with thought. Here, on their work intent, the Cyclops strove Eager to forge a thunder-bolt for Jove; Half-rough, half-form'd the glowing engine lay, And only wanted the fire-darting ray; And this they hammer'd out on anvils dire; At each collision flash'd the fatal fire. Not distant far, in lively colours plann'd, Two brothers, Zethus and Amphion stand, Sons of Antiopa: no turrets crown'd Thy city, Thebes, but walls were rising round. A mountain's rocky summit Zethus bore On his broad back, but seem'd to labour sore. Behind, Amphion tun'd his golden shell, Amphion, deem'd in music to excel: Rocks still pursu'd him as he mov'd along, Charm'd by the music of his magic song. Crown'd with soft tresses, in a fairer field, Gay Venus toy'd with Mars's splendid shield. Down from her shoulder her expanded vest Display'd the swelling beauties of her breast. She in the brazen buckler, glittering bright, Beheld her lovely image with delight. On a rich plain appear, not distant far, The Taphians, and Electryon's sons at war; Fat steers the prize for which the swains contend, Those strive to plunder, these their herds defend; The meads were moist with blood and rosy dew: The powerful many triumph'd o'er the few. Two chariots next roll'd lightly o'er the plains, This Pelops drove, and shook the sounding reins; Hippodamia at his side he view'd: In the next chariot, Myrtilus pursu'd, And with him Oenomas; approaching near, At Pelops' back he aim'd the vengeful spear; The faithless axle, as the wheels whirl'd round, Snapp'd short, and left him stretch'd along the ground. Here young Apollo stood, in act to throw The whirring arrow from the twanging bow, At mighty Tityus aim'd, who basely strove To force his mother, erst belov'd by Jove: He from fair Elara deriv'd his birth, Tho' fed and nourish'd by prolific Earth. There Phryxus stoop'd to listen to the ram, On whose broad back the Hellespont he swam. The beast look'd speaking; earnest could you gaze, The lively piece would charmingly amaze. Long might you feast your eye, and lend an ear, With pleasing hope the conference to hear. Such was the present of the blue-ey'd maid— In his right hand a missile lance he sway'd, Which Atalanta, to reward the brave, Sure pledge of friendship, to the hero gave, When on the breezy Mænalus she rov'd, And wish'd the company of him she lov'd; But he, of suitors' amorous strife afraid, Repress'd the fond intention of the maid. Thus rob'd, thus arm'd, he to the city went, Bright as a star that gilds the firmament, Which maids assembled view with eager eyes High o'er their roof in orient beauty rise. On the bright signal, as it darts its rays, Attentive they with silent transport gaze. Each, with this omen charm'd, expects, tho' late, Return'd from distant climes her destin'd mate. Thus shone the chief, for high achievements known, Majestic as he mov'd to Lemnos' town. The noble heroines his footsteps meet, With courteous joy the Grecian guest to greet, Whose downcast eye ne'er wander'd, till he came To the proud palace of the royal dame; Obsequious damsels at the portal wait, And quick unbar the double-folding gate: Then thro' the various courts extending wide, And stately rooms, Iphinoa was his guide; On a bright throne, with rich embroidery grac'd, Fronting her sovereign she the hero plac'd. Th' embarrass'd queen, her face with blushes spread, In courteous terms address'd the prince, and said: ‘Why, gentle stranger, should your warlike train ‘At distance far, without the walls remain? ‘The men who till'd these ample fields before, ‘Now turn rich furrows on the Thracian shore. ‘But hear, while I our matchless woes relate; ‘So shall you know the story of our fate. ‘When o'er this realm my father Thoas reign'd, ‘The Lemnian youth, to fraud and rapine train'd, ‘On Thracian borders seiz'd the trembling prey, ‘And brought whole flocks, and lovely maids away. ‘This Venus plann'd, with mischievous intent, ‘And fierce among them fatal discord sent. ‘Their wives they loath'd, and vainly impious led ‘War's spoils, fair captives, to the lawless bed. ‘Long we endur'd, forgiving insults past, ‘And hop'd the faithless would reform at last. ‘In vain; each day but doubled our disgrace, ‘Our children yielded to a spurious race. ‘The widow'd mother, the discarded maid, ‘Forlorn, neglected thro' the city stray'd. ‘No tender pity touch'd the parent's breast, ‘To see his darling child abus'd, oppress'd ‘Beneath a step-dame's proud, imperious sway: ‘No sons would then maternal duty pay, ‘Nor, as before, their mother's cause defend; ‘No sister then to sister prov'd a friend: ‘But the gay troops of Thracian captives fair ‘Inthrall'd the men, and challeng'd all their care; ‘At home, abroad, the first, at pleasure's call, ‘To share the banquet, and conduct the ball. ‘At length, but strange! some favouring power divine ‘In female minds inspir'd this bold design, ‘That, when return'd from Thracia's hateful shore, ‘Our roofs these traitors might protect no more; ‘That, thus constrain'd, they might forego their crimes, ‘Or with their captives flee to distant climes. ‘They sail, return, the few remaining males ‘Demand, then quit us with auspicious gales; ‘And now the frigid fields of Thrace they plough, ‘And countries whiten'd with Sithonian snow. ‘Haste then, conduct your comrades to the town: ‘Here fix your seat, and Lemnos is your own. ‘And if to high dominion you aspire, ‘Reign here, and wield the sceptre of my sire. ‘You must approve; for not so fair a coast, ‘Or isle so fertile can the Ægean boast. ‘Haste to your friends, and make my pleasure known, ‘Nor let them longer lodge without the town.’ Artful she spoke, forbearing to relate How in one night each woman slew her mate. Then Jason thus: “Whate'er your bounty grants, “Stores for our voyage, or our present wants, “Pleas'd we accept: I to my valiant bands “Will speed to signify your kind commands, “Then soon conduct my comrades to the town: “But still, O Queen, still wear your father's crown. “Not from disdain I shun imperial sway, “But great achievements call me hence away.” He spoke, and gently press'd her fair right hand, Then sought his comrades scatter'd o'er the strand. Unnumber'd damsels round the hero wait, Gazing with joy, and follow to the gate; Then grateful presents in swift cars convey To the land's margin, where the warriours lay. When Jason now to his adventurous bands Had signified Hypsipyla's commands, With eager joy the Minyans haste to share Her friendly roofs, and hospitable fare. The Queen of Love Thessalia's chiefs inspires, For Vulcan's sake, with amorous desires; That Lemnos, Vulcan's sacred isle, agen May flourish, peopled with a race of men. Great Jason hastens to the regal walls; The rest proceed where chance or pleasure calls, Save great Alcides; with a chosen train, Ambitious he in Argo to remain. Eager with joy the jolly crowds advance To share the genial feast, or lead the dance; To Venus' and to Vulcan's fane they throng, And crown the day with victims and with song. Sunk in soft ease th' enamour'd heroes lay, (Their voyage still deferr'd from day to day) And longer still, and longer had declin'd, Full loath to leave the lovely place behind, Had not Alcides, the fair dames apart, Thus spoke incens'd the language of his heart: ‘Mistaken comrades, does our kindred, say, ‘From our own country drive us far away? ‘Or are we fondly thus enamour'd grown ‘Of foreign damsels, and despise our own? ‘Here shall we stay to till the Lemnian fields? ‘Small fame to heroes this base commerce yields. ‘No God, propitious to the sons of Greece, ‘Without our toil, will grant the golden Fleece. ‘Our course pursue we; for the breeze invites; ‘And let him revel in Love's soft delights, ‘Who here but stays to propagate his kind, ‘And leave a memorable name behind.’ Alcides thus: none dar'd to lift his eye, To breathe a murmur, or to make reply; But keenly stung with this sarcastic stile, They haste to leave the lov'd Vulcanian isle. Soon as the damsels their fix'd purpose knew, Around the chiefs in busy crowds they flew. As bees from some deep-cavern'd rock proceed, Buzz o'er the lilies of the laughing mead, The sweets of all ambrosial herbs devour, And suck the soul of every fragrant flow'r; Thus they in swarms the parting Greeks address, With hands salute, with soothing words caress; Then to the Powers above with fervour pray, Safe to their arms the heroes to convey. Hypsipyla the hand of Jason press'd, And thus with tears the parting chief address'd: “Adieu!—and may you with the sons of Greece “Return triumphant with the golden Fleece. “Here shall you then my father's sceptre sway, “And his domains your sovereign will obey. “The neighbouring states will furnish large supplies, “And a vast empire by your wisdom rise. “But if on nobler plans your thoughts are bent, “And vainly I presage the wish'd event; “Absent or present, to my memory kind, “Still let Hypsipyla possess your mind. “And if with offspring heaven should bless me, say, “How shall I then my Jason's will obey?” The prince beheld the queen with rapturous look, And thus with mild benevolence bespoke: ‘May these events, foredoom'd by heaven's decree, ‘Successful prove, Hypsipyla, to thee. ‘But still of Jason nobler thoughts retain: ‘Enough for me o'er my own realms to reign; ‘May but the powers of heaven (I ask no more) ‘Safe reconvey me to my native shore. ‘If that's denied, and you, my source of joy, ‘Bear, the soft token of our loves, a boy; ‘Him, when mature, in kindness to your friend, ‘My parents' solace, to Iölcos send; ‘If then perchance the venerable pair ‘Survive their woes, and breathe this vital air. ‘There may he live, from Pelias far remov'd, ‘By Grecians honour'd, who his father lov'd. He spoke his last farewell: then first ascends The ship, and with him his illustrious friends. In their due stations plac'd, each seiz'd an oar, While Argus loos'd the cable from the shore. With active strokes the vigorous heroes sweep The sounding bosom of the billowy deep. As Orpheus counsel'd, and mild evening near, To Samothrace, Electra's isle, they steer; That there initiated in rites divine, Safe might they sail the navigable brine. But, Muse, presume not of these rites to tell: Farewell, dread isle! dire deities, farewell! Let not my verse these mysteries explain; To name is impious, to reveal profane. Thence the black main they lash'd with all their might, Thrace on their left, and Imbros on the right; And safely, with the now-declining sun, To far-projecting Chersonesus run. Then stemm'd they, aided by the southern gales, The stormy Hellespont with swelling sails, Left the high-surging sea with morning light, And reach'd Sigæum with approaching night. Dardania past, and high exalted Ide, They saw Abydos on the stormy tide. Thence sail'd they by Percote's pasture lands, Pityëa's meadows, and Abarnis' sands: And nightly, favour'd by the friendly blast, The purple-foaming Hellespont they past. An ancient island in Propontis lies, That towering lifts its summit to the skies; Near Phrygia's corn-abounding coast it stands, And far-projecting all the main commands; An island this, save where the isthmus' chain Connects both lands, and curbs the boisterous main. Round its rough sides the thundering tempests roar, And a safe bay is form'd on either shore. Æsepus' waters near this isthmus fall: And bordering tribes the mountain Arcton call. On this rough mountain, barbarous, fierce and bold, Dwell mighty giants, hideous to behold; And, wonderful to tell! each monster stands With six huge arms, and six rapacious hands; Two pendent on their shaggy shoulders grow, And four deform their horrid sides below. The lowland isthmus, verging to the main, The Dolions till'd, and all the fertile plain. O'er these reign'd Cyzicus the brave, the young, Who from the gallant warriour, Æneus, sprung. The daughter of Eusorus, first in fame, Bore Cyzicus, Æneta was her name. Secure they liv'd, and free from war's alarms, Tho' Earth's huge sons were terrible in arms. Sprung from the monarch of the hoary tide, On Neptune's aid the Dolian race rely'd. To this fair port, with gentle-breathing gales, This friendly shore, Thessalian Argo sails. Here the rope-fasten'd stone they heave on shore, Which serv'd as anchor to the ship before, But now too light, so Typhis bids, they bring, And leave it at the pure Artacian spring; Then choose another on the rocky bay, More ponderous far, the rolling ship to stay. There the first stone unnumber'd years remain'd, Till, as Apollo's oracle ordain'd, Th' Ionians found, with rites mysterious grac'd, And sacred to Jasonian Pallas plac'd. Soon as the Dolians, near approaching, knew Thessalian Argo, and the godlike crew, Led on by Cyzicus they haste to meet The princely band, and amicably greet; Invite them down the winding bay to fall, And fix their cable near the city-wall. Thus friendly treated, the Pelasgic train Strive with their oars th' interiour port to gain. Then first Ecbasian Phœbus they adore, And rear an altar on the sounding shore. To them the king dispatch'd, with heart benign, Fat sheep, and strong, exhilarating wine. For thus the sacred oracle foretold, ‘When here arrives a band of heroes bold, ‘With kind complacence treat the godlike crew, ‘Meet not in arms, but pay them honours due!’ Scarce had the down the monarch's cheeks o'erspread; No children yet had bless'd the nuptial bed. Clita, his lovely queen, the young, the fair, Renown'd for beauty, and her golden hair, Sprung from Percosian Merops, still remains A stranger to Lucina's cruel pains. Late from her father's court the king convey'd, With ample dower enrich'd, the blameless maid; Yet he neglects the genial bed, and feasts, All fears far banishing, with foreign guests. Oft he enquires of Pelias' stern command, And why the heroes left their native land. As oft they ask'd what cities neighbouring lay, And in Propontis which the safest bay. But scanty knowledge could the king bestow, Tho' it behov'd them much these truths to know. When morning rose, the Dindymean steep Some mount, to view the navigable deep, And all its winding bays; the road they came They honour'd with illustrious Jason's name. The chiefs, who chose aboard the ship to stay, Remov'd her from the moorings where she lay. Mean while the sons of Earth, a numerous train, From their bleak mountains rush into the plain, Besiege the pervious bay, and strive to block Its mouth with massy fragments from the rock; Intending there Thessalia's pine to keep Hemm'd up, like some huge monster of the deep. But Hercules remain'd; his bow he drew, And heaps of giants with his arrows stew. The rest enrag'd, rough, rocky fragments tore, Hurl'd high in air, and thunder'd from the shore. (This labour still for Hercules remain'd, By Juno, Jove's imperial queen, ordain'd) And fiercely now the glowing battle burn'd, When lo! the chiefs from Dindymus return'd, Attack'd the desperate giants in the rear, And dealt destruction with the dart and spear; Till Earth's fierce sons, defil'd with wounds and gore, Dropp'd dead; their bodies cover'd half the shore. As near the sea's broad brink, with sturdy strokes, Assiduous woodmen fell aspiring oaks; Then draw them in due order from the flood, And thus well drench'd they cleave with ease the wood: Thus at the entrance of the hoary bay, The frequent corse of many a giant lay; Some, tumbled headlong, made the sea their grave, While their legs rose above the briny wave; Some o'er the sands their horrid visage show, Their feet deep-rooted in the mud below. Thus their huge trunks afford abundant fare To Neptune's fishes, and the birds of air. Soon as concluded was the bloody fray, And favouring breezes call'd the chiefs away, They loos'd; o'er swelling ocean southern gales Breath'd all day long, and fill'd their bellying sails. Night rose, the favouring gales no longer last, The ship drives backward with the stormy blast. Again they harbour on the friendly coast, Where late the Dolians entertain'd the host; And round the rock the steady cable bind, The rock ev'n now to sacred fame consign'd. Here thro' the gloom of night again they came, And knew not that the country was the same. Nor knew the Dolians, so dark night prevail'd, That back to Cyzicum the Greeks had sail'd; But deem'd the chiefs a band of Macrian foes: To arms they call, and force to force oppose. A gleamy lustre glanc'd along the field, While spear met spear, and shield encounter'd shield. In sun-scorch'd bushes thus the bickering blaze Flames forth, and crackling on the branches preys. Dire was the conflict; on the fatal plain Their prince, alas! was number'd with the slain, His queen and bridal bed beheld he ne'er again. For Jason spy'd the prince advancing near, And thro' his bosom plung'd the furious spear; The ribs it broke, and circumscrib'd his date, Wing'd with th' inevitable will of Fate. Fate, like a wall, devoted man surrounds, And fast confines him in its circling bounds. Himself he deem'd, in that disorder'd fight, Vainly he deem'd! protected by the night: The favouring night, alas! produc'd his bane, And chiefs unnumber'd with their prince were slain. For Hercules, with his all-conquering bow, Dispatch'd Telecles to the shades below, And Megabrontes: by Acastus' hand Pale Sphodris lay extended on the strand. Peleus to Pluto's dark dominions gave Zelys the hardy, and Gephyrus brave. Bold Telamon, well-skill'd the lance to wield, Left Basileus expiring on the field. Next Idas vanquish'd Promeus by his side; By warlike Clytius Hyacinthus died. Fair Leda's sons, in bloody combat skill'd, Fierce Megalossacus and Phlogius kill'd. And Meleager added two to these, Itymoneus and valiant Artaces. These all were chiefs in fighting fields approv'd, Deplor'd as heroes, and as brothers lov'd. The rest for safety on their flight rely; (As trembling doves before the falcon fly) Then to the city-gates tumultuous press, And raise the piercing cry of deep distress; The city mourn'd: they deem'd, return'd from far, That hostile Macrians had renew'd the war. But when the rosy morn began to wake, All found their irretrievable mistake. Heart-rending grief oppress'd the Grecian train, To see the hospitable monarch slain, A clay-cold corse, extended on the shore, Deform'd with dust, and all besmear'd with gore. The Greeks and Dolians, sunk in deep despair, Mourn three long days, and rend their graceful hair. A tomb they rear upon the rising ground, And clad in brazen arms thrice march around; Then for the monarch, on Limonia's plain, Of rites observant, funeral-games ordain. There stands the tomb, adorn'd with honours due, Which distant ages will with sorrow view. When the sad news at Clita's ear arriv'd, Not long the queen her monarch's fate surviv'd; But woe augmenting, round her neck she tied The noose dishonest, and unseemly died. Her mournful dirge the weeping Dryads sung, While Dindymus with lamentations rung; And all the tears that from their eye-lids fell, The Gods transform'd, in pity, to a well; In crystal streams it murmurs still, and weeps, And still the name of wretched Clita keeps. A day so dismal, so replete with woes, Till this sad day, to Dolians never rose. Deep, deep immers'd in sorrow they remain'd, And all from life-supporting food abstain'd; Save such poor pittance as man's needs require, Of corn unground, or unprepar'd by fire. And annual, on this day, the Dolians still Sift coarsest meal, and at the public mill. Thenceforth twelve days and nights dire storms prevail, Nor could the chiefs unfurl the swelling sail. The following night, by sleep's soft power oppress'd, Once more in Cyzicum the heroes rest; Mopsus alone and brave Acastus keep The watch nocturnal, while their comrades sleep; When, lo! a Halcyon, of cerulean hue, O'er the fair head of slumbering Jason flew, In airy circles, wondrous to behold, And, screaming loud, the ceasing storm foretold. The grateful sound attentive Mopsus heard, And mark'd the meaning of the sea-bred bird; (Which gently rising from the deck below, Perch'd on the summit of th' aerial prow) Then rous'd he Jason from his fleecy bed, Of sheeps' soft skins compos'd, and thus he said; ‘O son of Æson, hear! be this thy care, ‘Haste, to the fane of Dindymus repair; ‘There Cybele with sacrifice implore, ‘So will the winds tempestuous cease to roar. ‘For this proclaim'd the boding Halcyon true, ‘As round thee, sunk in deep repose, she flew. ‘By Cybele's dread power the vast profound, ‘And all the winds in harmony are bound. ‘By her subsists prolific earth below, ‘And high Olympus, ever crown'd with snow. ‘Jove yields, when she ascends the courts of day, ‘And all the powers immortal own her sway.’ To Jason thus the venerable seer; And welcome came the tidings to his ear. Instant the chief, exulting with a bound, Sprung from the bed, and wak'd his comrades round. Elate with joy his looks, his words unfold The glad presage which Mopsus had foretold. Then from the stalls the youths appointed drove Selected oxen to the heights above. Some from the rock unloos'd the corded stay, And with fleet oars approach'd the Thracian bay. From thence the top of Dindymus they gain'd; Few were the heroes that aboard remain'd: By those the Macrian rocks, and Thracian land Directly opposite, appear'd at hand; The Thracian Bosphorus here, involv'd in shade, And Mysia's rising mountains were survey'd; There, where his waters black Æsepus pours, Nepea's plain, and Adrasteia's tow'rs. A vine's vast trunk adorn'd with branches stood, Though old, yet sound, and long had grac'd the wood; This trunk they hew'd, and made, by Argus' skill, An image of the Goddess of the hill; Which on the rocky eminence they plac'd, With the thick boughs of circling beeches grac'd, They rear an altar, then, on rising ground, Of stones that readiest lay, and wide around Dispose the branches of the sacred oak, And Dindymus's deity invoke, The guardian power of Phrygia's hills and woods, The venerable mother of the Gods. On Tityas and Cyllenus too they call, Of all her priests most lov'd, and honour'd most of all: For skill prophetic they alone are fam'd; Idean Dactyli these priests are nam'd; Both whom Anchiala in Dicte's cave Brought forth, where chill Oaxis rolls his wave. While on the burning victims Jason pours Libations due, the Goddess he implores To smile propitious on the Grecian train, And still the tempests of the roaring main. Then Orpheus call'd, and youthful chiefs advance, All clad in arms, to lead the martial dance; With clashing swords they clatter'd on their shields, And fill'd with festive sounds th' aerial fields. Lost in these sounds was every doleful strain, And their loud wailings for their monarch slain. The Phrygians still their Goddess' favour win By the revolving wheel and timbrel's din. Of these pure rites the mighty mother show'd Her mind approving, by these signs bestow'd; Boughs bend with fruit, Earth from her bosom pours Herbs ever green, and voluntary flow'rs. Fierce forest-beasts forsake the lonely den, Approach with gentleness, and fawn on men. A pleasing omen, and more wondrous still The Goddess gave: the Dindymean hill, That ne'er knew water on its airy brow, Bursts into streams, and founts perennial flow. This wonder still the Phrygian shepherds sing, And give the name of Jason to the spring. Then on the mount the chiefs the feast prolong, And praise the venerable queen in song. But when the morning rose, they plied their oars, And, the wind ceasing, left the Phrygian shores. Then fair contention fir'd the princely train, Who best the toil of rowing could sustain. For now the howling storm was lull'd to sleep; Etherial mildness had compos'd the deep. On the calm sea the labouring chiefs rely'd; Fleet flew the ship along the yielding tide; Not Neptune's steeds so swift, with loosen'd reins, Skim the light level of the liquid plains. But when with even-tide the blustering breeze Brush'd the broad bosom of the swelling seas, The wearied chiefs their toilsome course repress'd, And all, save great Alcides, sunk to rest. Swift thro' the waves his arm unaided drew The ship, deep-laden with the drowsy crew. Thro' all her planks the well-compacted pine Shook, as his oar dispers'd the foamy brine. But soon the heroes view'd the Mysian shore, As by the mouth of Rhyndacus they bore. On Phrygia's fields a wishful look they cast, And huge Ægæon's promontory pass'd, When great Alcides, at one luckless stroke, His oar, hard straining, near the middle broke. One part was swallow'd in the whelming main, One, though he fell, his grasping hands retain; Backward he fell, but soon his seat regain'd, And, loathing rest, in mute amaze remain'd. What time the weary labourer, wanting rest, Hies to his cot with pining fast oppress'd; Ev'n in the entrance of his rural door His tottering knees he bends, and moves no more; His dusty limbs he views, and callous hands, And curses hunger's insolent demands: Then, nor till then, the chiefs to Chius row, Chius, whose streams around Arganthon flow. The friendly Mysians on their peaceful coast Receive with hospitality the host; Abundant stores they send, with hearts benign, Fat sheep, and strong exhilarating wine. Some bring dry wood, and some in order spread Soft leaves and herbage for a spacious bed; Some from the flint elicit living fire; Some mix the wines that generous deeds inspire: The feast they crown, and rites to Phœbus pay, Ecbasian Phœbus, at the close of day. But Hercules the genial feast declin'd, And sought the wood, a fitting oar to find. Nor long he sought before a fir he found; Few leaves adorn'd it, and few branches crown'd; Yet as the poplar's stem aspires on high, This fir, so stout and tall, attracts his eye. On the green grass his bow he laid aside, His arrowy quiver, and the lion's hide. First with his club the solid soil he shook, Then in both arms, assur'd, the fir-tree took; Firm on his feet he stood, with bended knee; His big broad shoulder lean'd against the tree; Then heav'd it up, deep-rooted in the ground, Clogg'd with the soil's impediments around. As when, beneath Orion's wintry reign, The sudden tempest rushes from the main, Some tall ship's mast it tears, and every stay, And all the cordage, all the sails away: Thus he the trunk; then took, in haste to go, The hide, the club, his arrows and his bow. Meanwhile, preparing for his friend's return A ready supper, with his brazen urn Alone rov'd Hylas o'er the fields, to bring The purest water from the sacred spring. For to such tasks Alcides train'd his squire, Whom first he took an infant from his sire Theodamas; but him with sword severe He slew, who churlish had refus'd a steer. For when Theodamas, oppress'd with care, Turn'd the fresh furrow with his shining share, He disobey'd, ah wretch! the chief's command, Who claim'd the labouring ox that till'd the land. But know, Alcides sought for cause to bring War on Dryopia's kingdom and the king, For barbarous acts, and rights neglected long. But rove not, Muse, digressive from the song. Soon faithful Hylas to the fountain came, Which Mysian shepherds crystal Pegæ name; It chanc'd the nymphs, in neighbouring streams that dwell, Then kept a concert at the sacred well. In Dian's praise they rais'd the nightly song, All who to high, aerial hills belong; All who in caverns hide, or devious rove The mountain-forest, or the shady grove. When from her spring, unsullied with a stain, Rose Ephydatia, to attend the train, The form of Hylas rush'd upon her sight, In every grace of blushing beauty bright: For the full moon a beamy lustre shed, And heighten'd all the honours of his head. Fir'd with love's sudden flame, by Venus rais'd, The frantic naiad languish'd as she gaz'd: And soon as, stooping to receive the tide, He to the stream his brazen urn apply'd, In gush'd the foaming waves; the nymph with joy Sprung from the deep to kiss the charming boy. Her left arm round his lovely neck she threw, And with her right hand to the bottom drew. First Polyphemus heard, as wandering nigh This fatal fount, the youth's distressful cry, (In search of Hercules he rov'd the wood) And hied with hasty footsteps to the flood. As when a lion from his cavern'd rock, At distance hears the bleatings of the flock, To seize his prey he springs, with hunger bold, But faithful shepherds had secur'd the fold; Defeated of his prize, he roars amain, Rends his hoarse throat, and terrifies the swain: Thus Polyphemus call'd with voice profound, And vainly anxious rov'd the forest round. At length retreating, he the path explor'd Thro' which he came, and drew his trusty sword, Lest savage beasts should seize him for their prey, Or nightly robbers intercept his way. And as he brandish'd the bright burnish'd blade, He met Alcides in the gloomy shade, Unknown at first, but as he nearer drew, His friend returning to the ship he knew. Though his breath falters, and his spirits fail, He thus reveals the melancholy tale: ‘Hard is my lot, and much averse my will, ‘To be the first sad messenger of ill; ‘Young Hylas went to fetch fresh water late, ‘Not yet return'd; I tremble for his fate: ‘By robbers seiz'd or beasts, 'tis hard to guess; ‘I heard his cry, the signal of distress:’ Thus he: the sweat from great Alcides flow'd, And the black blood thro' all his body glow'd: Enrag'd, the fir-tree on the ground he threw, And, where his feet or frenzy hurried, flew. As when a bull, whom galling gadflies wound, Forsakes the meadows, and the marshy ground, The flowery food, the herd and herdsmen shuns, Now stands stock-still, and restless now he runs; Stung by the breese, he maddens with the pain, Tosses aloft his head, and roars amain: Thus ran the raging chief with matchless force, Then sudden stopp'd he, wearied with the course. Anxious in vain, he rov'd the forest round, The distant hills and vales his voice rebound. Now o'er the lofty mountains rose in view The morning-star, and mildest breezes blew: That instant Tiphys bade the heroes sail, Ascend the vessel, and enjoy the gale. The ready crew obey the pilot's word, Their anchor weigh, and haul the cords aboard; Then give the stretching canvass to the wind, And leave the Posidean rocks behind. When from the rosy orient, beaming bright, Aurora tipp'd the foot-worn paths with light; And o'er moist meads the glittering dew-drops shin'd, They miss'd those friends their folly left behind, Then rose contention keen, and pungent grief, For thus abandoning their bravest chief. In silence Jason sat, and long suppress'd, Though griev'd, the labouring anguish of his breast. Brave Telamon, with anger kindling, spoke: ‘Mute is thy tongue, and unconcern'd thy look: ‘To leave unconquer'd Hercules behind ‘Was a base project, and by thee design'd; ‘Lest, when to Greece we steer the sailing pine, ‘His brighter glories should out-dazzle thine. ‘But words avail not—I renounce the band, ‘Whose selfish wiles this stratagem have plann'd:’ Thus spoke Æacides, inflam'd with ire, His eye-balls sparkling like the burning fire; On Tiphys then, by rage impell'd, he flew: And once more Mysia had receiv'd the crew; Again the heroes the same course had sail'd, Though roaring winds and raging waves prevail'd, Had not bold Boreas' sons the chief address'd, And, nobly daring, his rough rage repress'd. (Ill fated youths! for that heroic deed Doom'd by the hands of Hercules to bleed. For when returning home their course they sped, From funeral games perform'd for Pelias dead, In sea-girt Tenos he the brothers slew, And o'er their graves in heapy hillocks threw The crumbling mould; then with two columns crown'd, Erected high the death-devoted ground; And one still moves, how marvellous the tale! With every motion of the Northern gale— But these are facts reserv'd for future years) Lo! sudden, Glaucus to their sight appears, Prophet of Nereus, rising from the main, Most skill'd of all his fate-foretelling train. High o'er the waves he rear'd his shaggy head, With his strong hand the rudder seiz'd, and said: ‘Why strive ye thus, tho' Jove's high will withstands, ‘To bear Alcides to the Colchian lands? ‘He must at Argos, so the fates ordain, ‘And so Eurystheus has decreed, sustain ‘Twelve mighty labours, thence be rais'd above, ‘To high Olympus, and the court of Jove. ‘Cease for Amphytrion's son, your murmurs cease, ‘And lull the sorrows of your souls to peace. ‘In Mysia, where meandering Chius strays, ‘Must Polyphemus a proud city raise: ‘Then, mid' the Calybes, a desperate clan, ‘Expires on Scythian plains the gallant man. ‘But strange is Hylas' fate: his youthful charms ‘Entic'd a nymph, who clasp'd him in her arms. ‘Now the blest pair the bands of Hymen bind; ‘In search of him the chiefs are left behind.’ This said, he plung'd into the gulf profound, The purple ocean foam'd in eddies round. The God descending with resistless sway, Impell'd the hollow vessel on her way. The chiefs rejoic'd this prodigy to view, And instant Telamon to Jason flew In friendly sort, and in his right he took The prince's hand, and thus embracing spoke: ‘Illustrious chief, let not thine anger rise ‘At aught I said impetuous and unwise. ‘Grief for my friend has made me indiscreet, ‘And utter words for Jason's ear unmeet; ‘Those to the winds wide-scattering let us give, ‘And, as before, in friendly concord live.’ Then Jason thus; “Thy censures wound my mind, “Which say, I left the bravest Greek behind. “Yet though thy words reproachful guilt suggest, “Rage dwells not long in Jason's generous breast; “Since not for flocks or riches we contend, “But a bold hero, and a faithful friend. “And thou, I trust, if reason calls, wilt be “As firm and warm an advocate for me.” He spoke; and now, the hateful contest o'er, The chiefs resum'd the seats they held before. But for those heroes, whom they left behind, By Jove's decree are various cares design'd. Nam'd from its stream, the boast of future days, Must one on Mysian plains a city raise: One (great Alcides) other toils must share, And learn Euristheus' stern commands to bear. Long time he threaten'd, for his Hylas lost, Instant destruction to the Mysian coast, Unless the Mysians to his arms restor'd, Alive or dead, the partner of his board. Of all their bands the choicest youths they chose, And them as pledges of their faith propose; Then swore they all, their search should never end, Till haply they had found the hero's friend. Still to this day the fond Cianians seek (All who at Trachin dwell) the lovely Greek. For beauteous youths, to Trachin's walls convey'd, Were there as pledges to Alcides paid. Meanwhile all day and night brisk breezes blew, Fleet o'er the foaming flood the vessel flew; But when the dawn gave promise of the day, The winds expiring gently died away. A land projecting o'er the bay below The chiefs discover'd, and to this they row; This peaceful port awhile the Minyans chose, And, as they reach'd it, grateful morning rose. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. THE ARGUMENT. This Book contains the combat between Amycus and Pollux; the former of whom is slain. A battle ensues between the Argonauts and Bebrycians, in which the Argonauts come off conquerors. They sail to Salmydessus, a city of Thrace, where they consult Phineus, a soothsayer, on the success of their expedition. He promises, if they would deliver him from the Harpies, to direct them safely to Colchos. His request is granted, and he gives them instructions. The story of Paræbius, Cyrene and Aristæus. They sail through the Symplegades, and thence to the island Thynia, where they land. Apollo, who here appears to them, is rendered propitious by sacrifice. The course of the river Acheron is described. They land on the coast of the Mariandyni, and are hospitably entertained by Lycus, the king of that country. Here Idmon is killed by a wild boar, and here Tiphys dies. Ancæus is appointed pilot in his stead. They sail by the monument of Sthenelus, whose ghost is released by Proserpine, and gratified with the sight of the Argonauts. At the island of Mars they meet the sons of Phrixus, who had just before been shipwrecked. They are kindly received by the Argonauts, who take them on board. Sailing by Mount Caucasus they come in sight of the eagle that preys on the entrails of Prometheus. The end of their voyage. Tents o'er the beach Bebrycia's king had spread, And stalls erected where fat oxen fed. To genial Neptune a Bithynian dame Bore the fierce tyrant, Amycus his name, Proudest of men; who this hard law decreed, That from his realm no stranger should recede, Till first with him compell'd in fight to wield The dreadful gauntlet in the listed field. Unnumber'd guests his matchless prowess slew: Stern he accosts swift Argo's valiant crew, Curious the reason of their course to scan, Who, whence they were; and scornful thus began: ‘Learn what 'tis meet ye knew, ye vagrant host; ‘None that e'er touches on Bebrycia's coast, ‘Is thence by law permitted to depart, ‘Till match'd with me he prove the boxer's art. ‘Choose then a chief who can the gauntlet wield, ‘And let him try the fortune of the field: ‘Should ye contemptuous scorn my fix'd decree, ‘Know, your proud hearts shall yield to fate and me.’ Thus spoke the chief with insolent disdain, And rous'd resentment in the martial train; But Pollux most his vaunting words provoke, Who thus, a champion for his fellows, spoke: “Threat not, whoe'er thou art, the bloody fray; “Lo, we obsequious thy decrees obey! “Unforc'd, this instant, to the lists I go, “Thy rival I, thy voluntary foe.” Stung to the heart with this severe reply, On him he turn'd his fury-flaming eye: As the grim lion, pierc'd by some keen wound, Whom hunters on the mountain-top surround; Though close hemm'd in, his glaring eye-balls glance On him alone who threw the pointed lance. The Greek stript off his mantle richly wrought, Late from the Lemnian territory brought, Which some fair nymph, who had her flame avow'd, The pledge of hospitable love bestow'd: His double cloak, with clasps of sable hue, Bebrycia's ruler on the greensword threw, And his rough sheep-hook of wild olive made, Which lately flourish'd in the woodland shade. Then sought the heroes for a place at hand Commodious for the fight, and on the strand They plac'd their friends, who saw, with wondering eyes, The chiefs how different, both in make and size; For like Typhœus' race the tyrant stood Enormous, or that miscreated brood Of mighty monsters, which parturient Earth, Incens'd at Jove, brought forth, a hideous birth. But Pollux shone like that mild star on high, Whose rising ray illumes fair Evening's sky. Down spread his cheek, ripe manhood's early sign, And in his eye-balls beam'd the glance divine. But like a lion, glorying in his might, Stood Jove's puissant son, prepar'd for fight. His arms he poiz'd, advancing in the ring, To try if still they kept their pristine spring; If pliant still, and vigorous as before, Nor rigid grown with labouring at the oar. Trial like this the haughty king disdain'd: Aloof and silent Amycus remain'd. Full on his foe his vengeful eyes he turn'd, For blood he thirsted, and for conquest burn'd. With that his squire Lycoreus, full in view, Two pair of gauntlets in the circle threw, Of barbarous fashion, harden'd, rough and dry'd. Then thus the king, with insolence and pride: ‘Lo, two stout pair; the choice I leave to thee; ‘(No lot appoints them) choose, and blame not me. ‘Bind them secure, and after trial tell, ‘How greatly I in either art excel, ‘Whether to form the cestus firm and good, ‘Or stain the cheeks of mighty men with blood.’ He spoke: brave Pollux nothing deign'd to say, But smiling chose the pair which nearest lay. To cheer their champion, Castor, honour'd name! And Talaüs, the son of Bias, came; Firm round his arms the gloves of death they bind, And animate the vigour of his mind. Aratus, and bold Ornytus his friend, To Amycus their kind assistance lend: Fools! for they knew not, this one conflict o'er, Those gauntlets never should be buckled more. Accoutred thus each ardent hero stands, And raises high in air his iron hands; With clashing gauntlets fiercely now they close, And mutual meditate death-dealing blows. First Amycus a furious onset gave, Like the rude insult of the battering wave, That, heap'd on high by driving wind and tide, Bursts thundering on some gallant vessel's side; The wary pilot, by superior skill, Foresees the storm, and shuns the menac'd ill. Thus threatening Amycus on Pollux press'd, Nor suffer'd his antagonist to rest: But Jove's brave son observes each coming blow, Quick leaps aside, and disappoints the foe; And where a weak unguarded part he spies, There all the thunder of his arms he plies. As busy shipwrights stoutly labouring strive Through sturdy planks the piercing spikes to drive, From head to stern repeated blows go round, And ceaseless hammers send a various sound; Thus from their batter'd cheeks loud echoes sprung, Their dash'd teeth crackled, and their jaw-bones rung: Nor ceas'd they from the strokes that threaten'd death, Till tir'd with toil they faintly gasp'd for breath: Awhile they then remit the bloody fray, And panting wipe the copious sweat away. But adverse soon they meet, with rage they glow, Like bulls fierce fighting for some favourite cow. Then Amycus, collecting all his might, Rose to the stroke, resolv'd his foe to smite, And by one blow the dubious war conclude: The wary prince, his ruin to elude, Bent back his head; defeated of its aim, The blow impetuous on his shoulder came. Then Pollux with firm steps approaching near, Vindictive struck his adversary's ear; Th' interior bones his ponderous gauntlet broke; Flat fell the chief beneath his dreadful stroke: The Grecians shouted, with wild rapture fir'd, And, deeply groaning, Amycus expir'd. The griev'd Bebrycians saw their monarch slain, And big with vengeance rush'd into the plain; With season'd clubs and javelins arm'd they ran, And aim'd their fury at the conquering man. Their keen-edg'd swords the friends of Pollux drew, And to the succour of their comrade flew. First Castor slaughter'd, with victorious hand, A hero of the bold Bebrycian band, The griding sword at once his head divides, And on his shoulders hang the parted sides. Mimans, Itymoneus of giant-size, Each by the arm of conquering Pollux dies. On this his foot impress'd a deadly wound Full on his side, and stretch'd him on the ground: His right hand dash'd, with unresisted sway, Mimans' left eye, and tore the ball away. Orcides, Amycus's proud compeer, Then launch'd at Talaüs his brazen spear; Just near his flank the point he lightly felt, That ras'd the skin beneath his broider'd belt. Aratus, with his club of harden'd oak, Aim'd at brave Iphitus a deadly stroke: Vain thought! too soon, alas! it is decreed, The hero by his brother's sword must bleed. Then rush'd, to succour the Thessalian band, Ancæus, with his pole-axe in his hand; O'er his broad back a bear's dark spoils he threw, And boldly mingled with the hostile crew. The sons of Æacus, renown'd for might, And Jason join'd them in the fields of fight. As when, what time both dogs and shepherds keep Close in warm cots, neglectful of their sheep, Wolves, pinch'd with hunger and bleak winter's cold, Leap o'er the fence, and terrify the fold, With ravening eyes the crowded sheep survey, And doubt where first to rend the trembling prey; Thus the bold Greeks, as near their foes they drew, Intimidate the congregated crew. As swains with smoke, of honey studious, strive From some rock's cleft the swarming bees to drive; Alarm'd and trembling, with a murmuring sound, They crowd to all their waxen rooms around; But if the fumes prevail, their wings they ply, And rove uncertain thro' the various sky: Dispersing thus, the wild Bebrycians fled, And loud proclaim'd that Amycus was dead. Ah, hapless race of men! they little knew, That, soon, far greater evils must ensue: Soon must they see, their monarch now no more, Their lands a drear, depopulated shore; Their vineyards spoil'd, and wasted all their coast By Lycus, and the Mariandine host: For 'twas their fate, with spear and steely brand, Hard lot! to battle for an iron land. The Greeks then seiz'd their herds, an easy prey, And from the sheep-folds drove the flocks away; The live provision to their ship they sent: Then thus some sailor gave his boasting vent; ‘What had these miscreants done, with fears dismay'd, ‘Had heaven indulg'd us with Alcides' aid? ‘No fierce contention then, I judge, had been, ‘No bloody boxing on the listed green: ‘The chief's stout club had tam'd the tyrant's pride, ‘And set his execrable laws aside. ‘But now, impell'd by swelling waves and wind, ‘We leave at land the matchless chief behind; ‘Whose loss distress to every Greek will prove.’ He said;—but all things own the will of Jove. All night the heroes on the coast remain, To heal the bruises of the wounded train. First to the gods they give the honours due, And next, a banquet for the princely crew. Nor can night's shades the chiefs to sleep incline, Or o'er the sacrifice, or o'er the wine; Mirthful they sit, their brows with laurel crown'd: To a green laurel was the cable bound. While Orpheus strikes the lyre, the hymn they raise, And Jove's fam'd offspring, mighty Pollux, praise: Soft breathes the breeze, the billows cease to roar, And festive joy exhilarates the shore. But when the sun illum'd the hills and plains, Dank with the dew, and rous'd the shepherd-swains, They sent abundant flocks and herds aboard, And from the laurel-stem unloos'd the cord; And while the favourable winds prevail'd, Thro' the rough-rolling Bosphorus they sail'd. When, lo! a wave by gathering surges driv'n, Swoln big for bursting, is up-heav'd to heav'n, Still rises higher, and still wider spreads, And hangs a watery mountain o'er their heads; Like a black cloud it frowns, prepar'd to fall, And threatens quick destruction to them all. Yet the train'd pilot, by superior skill, Well knows to 'scape this last impending ill: Safe through the storm the vessel Tiphys steer'd, And sav'd the heroes from the fate they fear'd. Fronting Bithynia's coast, next morn, they reach New land, and fix their halsers on the beach. There on the margin of the beating flood The mournful mansions of sad Phineus stood, Agenor's son; whom heaven ordain'd to bear The grievous burden of unequall'd care. For, taught by wise Apollo to descry Unborn events of dark futurity, Vain of his science, the presumptuous seer Deign'd not Jove's awful secrets to revere; But wantonly divulg'd to frail mankind The sacred purpose of th' omniscient mind: Hence Jove indignant gave him length of days, But dimm'd in endless night his visual rays. Nor would the vengeful God indulge his taste With the sweet blessings of a pure repast, Tho' (for they learn'd his fate) the country round Their prophet's board with every dainty crown'd. For, lo! descending sudden from the sky, Round the pil'd banquet shrieking Harpies fly, Whose beaks rapacious, and whose talons tear Quick from his famish'd lips th' untasted fare. Yet would some slender pittance oft remain, Life to support, and to perpetuate pain. Such odours still the nauseous scraps exhal'd, That with the stench the loathing stomach fail'd. Aloof the guests amaz'd and hungry stood, While their sick hearts abhorr'd the putrid food. But now the princely crew approaching near, The welcome sound invades the prophet's ear; Taught by almighty Jove, that now was come The long-wish'd period of heaven's vengeful doom; When, by these heroes' destin'd aid restor'd, Peace should hereafter bless his feastful board. Then heaves he from the couch his haggard head, (Like some pale, lifeless, visionary shade) Propp'd on his staff his way explores, and crawls With lingering step along the lonely walls: Diseas'd, enfeebled, and by age unbrac'd, Thro' every limb he trembled as he pass'd; Shrunk was his form, with want adust and thin, The pointed bones seem'd bursting thro' his skin: But faint and breathless as he reach'd the gate, Down on the threshold, tir'd with toil, he sat, In dizzy fumes involv'd, his brain runs round, And swims beneath his feet the solid ground; No more their functions the frail senses keep, But speechless sinks he in a death-like sleep. This saw the chiefs amaz'd, and gather'd round; When from his labouring lungs a hollow sound (His breath and utterance scarce recover'd) broke, And thus th' enlighten'd seer prophetic spoke: ‘Princes of Greece, attend; if ye be they ‘Whom o'er the main Thessalia's pines convey, ‘And Jason leads to Colchos' magic land; ‘Such is your cruel tyrant's stern command. ‘Yes, ye are they; for yet my mental eye ‘Undimm'd, past, present, future can descry: ‘Thanks to thy son, Latona, who bestows ‘This grace, this only solace of my woes. ‘By Jove, to whom the suppliant's cause belongs, ‘Who hates the cruel, and avenges wrongs; ‘By Phœbus, and by Juno, from on high ‘Who marks your progress with compassion's eye, ‘Aid me, and, oh! a sufferer's pangs assuage, ‘And bid corrosive famine cease to rage: ‘Leave me not thus, unpitied and unbless'd; ‘But ere you sail, ah! pity the distress'd. ‘For not these orbs alone, depriv'd of sight, ‘Vindictive Heaven hath veil'd in doleful night; ‘But to extreme old age his cruel law ‘Dooms me th' unwasting thread of life to draw. ‘Still weightier woes from sorrow's lengthen'd chain ‘Depend, and pain is ever link'd to pain. ‘From secret haunts, aërial, unexplor'd, ‘Flights of devouring Harpies vex my board; ‘Swift, instantaneous, sudden they descend, ‘And from my mouth the tasteful morsel rend. ‘Meanwhile my troubled soul, with woe oppress'd, ‘No means of aid, no comfort can suggest. ‘For when the feast I purpose to prepare, ‘They see that purpose, and prevent my care: ‘But cloy'd, and glutted with the luscious spoil, ‘With noisome ordure parting they defile ‘Whate'er remains, if aught perchance remain, ‘That none approaching may the stench sustain, ‘Tho' his strong heart were wrapp'd in plated mail, ‘The filthy fragments such dire steams exhale. ‘Yet me fell hunger's all-subduing pain ‘Compels reluctant, loathing to remain; ‘Compels the deadly odours to endure, ‘And gorge my craving maw with food impure. ‘From these invaders (so hath Fate decreed) ‘By Boreas' offspring shall my board be freed. ‘Nor on a stranger to your house and blood, ‘O sons of Boreas, is your aid bestow'd. ‘Phineus behold, Agenor's hapless son, ‘Once for prophetic skill and riches known; ‘Who, while I sway'd the Thracian sceptre, led ‘Your portion'd sister to my spousal bed.’ Here Phineus ceas'd, and touch'd each pitying chief: But Boreas' sons were pierc'd with double grief; Compassion kind was kindled in their breast: Their tears abating, friendly Zetes press'd His trembling hand, and thus the seer address'd: “O most disastrous of all human kind, “Whence spring these evils that o'erwhelm thy mind? “Hast thou, intrusted with the book of Fate, “By folly merited celestial hate? “Hence falls this indignation on thy head? “Fain would the sons of Boreas grant thee aid; “Fain would they execute what heaven ordains, “But awful dread their willing hands restrains. “To frighted mortals well thy sufferings prove “How fierce the vengeance of the Gods above. “Swear, or we dare not, as we wish, essay “To drive these hateful Harpies far away: “Swear that the succours, which our arms intend, “Shall no superior deity offend.” He spoke; and straight to heaven disclosing wide His sightless eye-balls, thus the seer reply'd: ‘My son, th' injustice of thy tongue restrain, ‘Nor let such thoughts thy pious soul profane. ‘By Phœbus, heavenly augur, who inspires ‘My conscious bosom with prophetic fires; ‘By every woe fate destines me to bear, ‘And by these eyes, involv'd in night, I swear; ‘By the fell demons of the realms below, ‘(Whom ever unpropitious may I know, ‘From their resentment not in death secure, ‘If falsly their dread godheads I adjure;) ‘That, should a captive by your arms be freed, ‘No God vindictive will avenge the deed.’ Then acquiescing in the solemn pray'r, To aid the prophet Boreas' sons prepare. The youthful train a banquet spread; the last Which those fell Harpies were decreed to taste. Nigh stand the brothers, ardent to oppose With glittering falchions their invading foes. But scarce the first sweet morsel Phineus took, When from the clouds with swift prevention broke, (Swift as the lightning's glance, or stormy blast, Whose rapid fury lays the forest waste) Shrill-clamouring for their prey, the birds obscene; The watchful heroes shouting rush'd between; But they with speediest rage the cates devour'd, And round intolerable odours pour'd; Then o'er th' Ægean far away they flew; The sons of Boreas arm'd with swords pursue; Close they pursue; for Jove, that signal day, Their strength proportion'd to the desperate fray; The strength he gave had Jove, that day, deny'd, In vain their pinions had the brothers plied. For when to Phineus furious they repair, Or quitting Phineus seek the fields of air, The light-wing'd monsters, fleeter than the wind, Leave the careering Zephyrs far behind. As when swift hounds, experienc'd in the chace, Through some wide forest, o'er the scented grass The bounding hind, or horned goat pursue, Near, and more near their panting prey they view; And eager stretching, the short space to gain, They snap, and grind their gnashing fangs in vain: Thus ever near, the rapid chiefs pursu'd, The Harpies thus their grasping hands elude. But now far off in the Sicilian main, By the wing'd brothers, sons of Boreas, slain, The Harpy-race, tho' every God withstood, Had stain'd the Plotian isles with sacred blood; Their sore distress had Iris not survey'd, And darting from the skies the heroes staid: ‘O sons of Boreas, the dread laws above ‘Permit you not to wound the dogs of Jove: ‘And, lo! my oath I pledge, that never more ‘Shall these fell dogs approach the Thracian shore.’ This said, adjuring the tremendous floods, Most fear'd, most honour'd by immortal Gods; By the slow-dripping urn of Styx she swore; The prophet's peaceful mansions on the shore For ever from those spoilers should be free; Such was the fatal sisters' fix'd decree. The Goddess swore, the brothers straight obey, And back to Argo wing their airy way: The Strophades from thence derive their name, The Plotian islands styl'd by ancient fame. Disparting then, to different regions flew The maid celestial and the monster-crew. Those to the grots retir'd, the dark retreat Of Dicte's caverns in Minoian Crete; While the gay Goddess of the watery bow Soar'd on fleet pinions to Olympus' brow. Mean-while the princes, with unwearied pains, Wash from their seer the Harpies' filthy stains: Next from the spoils, which on Bebrycia's shore From vanquish'd Amycus brave Pollux bore, The fleecy victims they select with care; And sooth the Gods with sacrifice and pray'r. Then in the palace each heroic guest Partakes the pleasures of the sumptuous feast: With them sat Phineus, and refresh'd his soul With savoury viands, and the cheering bowl: While yet he feasts, insatiate still he seems, And shares a bliss beyond the bliss of dreams. Tho' now the rage of hunger was repress'd, And generous wine had open'd every breast; Yet still the chiefs prolong the banquet late, And for the feather'd sons of Boreas wait. Plac'd in the midst, before the cheerful fire, Thus of their voyage spoke the sacred sire: ‘Hear what the Gods permit me to relate; ‘For 'tis profane to publish all your fate. ‘Unnumber'd woes I felt, and feel them still, ‘For erst divulging Jove's almighty will: ‘To man he gives Fate's dark events to scan ‘In part, but always leaves dependent man. ‘When hence your destin'd voyage ye pursue, ‘Two rocks will rise, tremendous to the view, ‘Just in the entrance of the watery waste, ‘Which never mortal yet in safety past: ‘Not firmly fix'd; for oft with hideous shock ‘Adverse they meet, and rock encounters rock: ‘The boiling billows dash their airy brow, ‘Loud thundering round the ragged shore below. ‘Safe if ye hope to pass, my counsel hear, ‘Be rul'd by prudence, and the Gods revere; ‘Nor on your unexperienc'd youth depend, ‘The want of caution brings you to your end. ‘First from your ship a nimble dove let fly, ‘And on the sure prognostic bird rely; ‘Safe thro' the rocks if she pursue her way, ‘No longer ye the destin'd course delay; ‘Steer for the strait, and let the rowers sweep ‘With stretching oars the close-contracted deep: ‘For not in prayers alone your safety stands; ‘But nervous vigour, and the strength of hands. ‘Ply then your oars, and strain at every stroke; ‘But first with prayer the Deities invoke. ‘The dove's sad fate should you desponding view, ‘Crush'd by the closing fragments as she flew, ‘Steer back, left you against those rocks be driv'n, ‘Steer back; 'tis safest to submit to Heav'n. ‘'Twere death thro' them to force the foaming keel, ‘Tho' heaven-built Argo were compos'd of steel. ‘O friends, be warn'd by me, nor rashly dare ‘To venture farther than my words declare; ‘Me though ye deem the righteous Gods pursue ‘With direful vengeance, threefold more than due; ‘Tempt not without the dove this dangerous strait, ‘For man must suffer what's ordain'd by Fate. ‘But if with active oars ye safely gain, ‘Through these tremendous rocks, the distant main; ‘Close to Bithynia let your vessel run, ‘And on the left the dangerous shallows shun; ‘Till Rhebas, rapid-rolling stream, ye reach, ‘The gloomy shore, and Thynia's sheltering beach. ‘Thence o'er the billows fronting Thynia's strand, ‘Soon will ye gain the Mariandine land. ‘Here lies the path to Pluto's dreary caves, ‘Here Acherusia frowns above the waves, ‘Whose skirts the gulfy Acheron divides, ‘And from deep whirlpools disembogues his tides. ‘Thence, not far distant, with the western gale, ‘Near Paphlagonia's towering heights ye sail, ‘The hardy sons of which inclement coast ‘Enetean Pelops for their founder boast. ‘Full to the north a promontory fam'd ‘Lifts the high head in air, Carambis nam'd; ‘The northern winds below its summit sweep, ‘So loftily it rises o'er the deep. ‘This point once doubled, a new coast expands ‘Its ample plains, and on the limit stands ‘A cape far-jutting, from whose rocky shores ‘The rapid Halys in old ocean roars. ‘Near him clear Iris draws his humbler train, ‘In silver torrents foaming to the main. ‘Beyond projects an headland tall and steep, ‘And forms a peaceful harbour in the deep. ‘Here o'er extensive fields Thermodon pours, ‘Near Themiscyria's heights, his watery stores. ‘Next lie the spacious Dœan plains, and near ‘Three cities of the Amazons appear: ‘And next the Chalybes, inur'd to toil, ‘Work at the forge, and turn the stubborn soil. ‘Near these the wealthy Tiberenians till, ‘Sacred to Jove, the Genetæan hill. ‘The Mossynœcians, next, the country round ‘Possess, with mountains and with forests crown'd. ‘In towers they live of solid timber fram'd, ‘Mossynes call'd, and thence the nation nam'd. ‘When these are past, an island bleak and bare ‘Lies full in view, there guide your ship with care, ‘And thence with care those noxious birds expel, ‘Which on the desert shore unnumber'd dwell. ‘Here form'd of solid stone, and seen from far, ‘Stands the rough temple of the God of war. ‘Two Amazonian queens, renown'd for arms, ‘Had rais'd the fane, when stunn'd with war's alarms. ‘Steer to this island through the stormy main, ‘And, all that mariners can wish, ye gain. ‘But why should I each circumstance disclose, ‘And make again the powers of heaven my foes? ‘Beyond that isle, but on the fronting shores, ‘The Philyreans feed their fleecy stores: ‘The brave Macronians till the neighbouring coast; ‘Next these the numerous Bechirian host: ‘Near them Sapirians and Byzerians dwell, ‘And next the Colchians, who in arms excel. ‘But ye, your steady course in Argo keep, ‘Shun the false shores, and plough secure the deep, ‘Till that rich coast ye reach, where Phasis leads ‘From Amarantine hills o'er Colchian meads ‘His liquid stores, and through fam'd Circe's plain; ‘Then rolls his widening current to the main. ‘To this fam'd stream pursue your watery way, ‘Soon will your eyes Æeta's towers survey, ‘And Mars's grove, where, wondrous to behold! ‘Hangs on a spreading oak the fleecy gold. ‘A hideous dragon of enormous size ‘Turns all around his circumspective eyes: ‘O'er the bright spoil the strictest watch he keeps; ‘He never slumbers, and he never sleeps.’ He spoke, and terror curdled all their blood; Deep fix'd in silence long the warriors stood. At length thus Jason, though possess'd with fear: “Tell us, O tell us, venerable seer, “Th' event of all our toils; the sign explain “How safely we may pass into the main “Thro' those dire rocks: and, O! indulgent, say, “Shall we once more our native land survey? “Unskill'd am I, unskill'd our martial train; “How shall I act, how measure back the main? “For far as ever flying sails were furl'd “Lies Colchos, on the limits of the world.” Thus Jason spoke; and thus the prophet old: ‘Those dangerous rocks once pass'd, my son, be bold. ‘Some God from Æa shall thro' seas untry'd, ‘Skirted by others coasts, your vessel guide, ‘But you, to Æa sailing, on your crew confide. ‘But, friends, to Venus be due honours paid; ‘Still in remembrance keep her secret aid. ‘On all your toils she kindly will bestow ‘A glorious end—expect no more to know.’ Scarce had he spoke, when speeding back repair The sons of Boreas through the fields of air, At the seer's door with nimble feet they light; Up rose the chiefs rejoicing at the sight. When Zetes trembling, and with toils oppress'd, While thick short sobs incessant heav'd his chest, Tells how they drove the Harpies far away, How Iris screen'd them, and forbad to slay, And pledg'd her solemn oath: while they retreat To the huge caves of mountain-cover'd Crete. These joyful tidings cheer'd the hearts of all, But most the prophet's, in the feastful hall; Whom Jason thus: “Sure from his heavenly state “Some God look'd down, and wail'd thy woeful fate, “And fore-decreed from far our bands to send, “That Boreas' sons might their assistance lend. “Should the same God restore thy long-lost sight, “My gladden'd soul would feel as great delight, “As ev'n my native country could bestow.” Then thus sage Phineus with dejected brow: ‘My eyes, alas! shall ne'er behold the day; ‘Shrunk are these balls, and quench'd the visual ray: ‘Heaven round me soon death's gloomy shade shall spread, ‘And every honour will await me dead.’ With converse thus the fleeting hours they cheer'd, When rosy morning beaming bright appear'd. The neighbouring peasants round, with early day, Flock to the seer, their due regards to pay; This daily custom love and reverence taught, And some provision for the sage they brought. All came to learn by his prophetic lore; He to the rich divin'd, and to the poor: For numerous votaries he reliev'd from dread, Who dearly lov'd him, and who daily fed. With these his steady friend Paræbius came, Who saw with joy these gallant sons of fame. To him prophetic Phineus had foretold, That a young band of Grecians, brave and bold, Should, in their voyage to the Colchian shore, In Thynia's bay their well-built vessel moor, And from these coasts, those ravenous birds of prey, The Harpies drive, though sent by Jove, away. The seer well pleas'd dismiss'd his friendly train, But bade Paræbius with the Greeks remain, And fetch him instant from his numerous stock A sheep, the best and fairest of the flock. The willing swain obey'd the seer's request, And Phineus thus the mariners address'd: ‘We are not all unciviliz'd and rude, ‘My friends, nor guilty of ingratitude. ‘That shepherd to my mansion came of late, ‘To learn from me the colour of his fate; ‘For the more labours and fatigues he bore, ‘Pale, pining want oppress'd him still the more; ‘New woes succeeded to the woes that past, ‘And every day was darker than the last: ‘And yet no crime had poor Paræbius wrought, ‘Alas! he suffered for his father's fault: ‘Who, when alone, and on the mountain's brow, ‘With cruel axe he laid the forest low, ‘Deaf to a doleful Hamadryad's pray'r, ‘The nymph neglected, and refus'd to spare, ‘Though oft she urg'd this lamentable plea; “Pity, ah! pity my coeval tree, “Where I so many blissful ages dwelt!” ‘But his hard heart no soft compassion felt; ‘The tree he fell'd; and for this foul disgrace ‘The nymph ordain'd him woes, and all his race. ‘To me Paræbius came oppress'd with fear, ‘The cause I found, and counsell'd him to rear ‘An altar to the goddess of the shore, ‘And pardon for his father's crimes implore. ‘Thus was the guilt aton'd; e'er since the man ‘Pays all regards that grateful mortal can; ‘For ever at my side he loves to stay, ‘And always goes unwillingly away.’ Thus Phineus spoke, when from his fleecy stock His friend brought two, the fairest of the flock. Then Jason rose, and, urg'd by Phineus blind, Rose the bold offspring of the northern wind; Their sacred offerings on the flames they lay, Invoking Phœbus at the dawn of day. The choicest viands with assiduous care The younger heroes for their friends prepare. Thus feasted, some their vessel's cordage press'd, Some in the prophet's mansion sunk to rest. Etesian breezes with the morning blow, Which, sent by Jove, o'er every region flow. The nymph Cyrene, in old times, 'tis said, Her flocks beside Thessalian Peneus fed, Pleas'd with the honours of her virgin-name, Till day's bright God seduc'd the rural dame. Far from Hæmonia he convey'd the fair, Brought to the nymphs, and trusted to their care, The mountain-nymphs that in parch'd Libya keep Their airy mansions on Myrtosia's steep. Cyrene there, along the winding shore, Thee, Aristæus, to Apollo bore; To whom rich swains, who in Thessalia live, The names of Agreus, and of Nomius give. With length of days the God her love repaid, And fix'd her huntress of the woodland shade; But the young boy to Chiron's care he gave, To reap instruction in his learned cave. To him, when blooming in the prime of life, The Muses gave Autonoë to wife; And taught their favourite pupil to excel In arts of healing, and divining well. To him they gave their numerous flocks to feed, Which Phthia's Athamantine pastures breed; And those that stray on Othrys' lofty brow, Or where Apidanus' fam'd waters flow. But when fierce Syrius scorch'd the Cyclades, The realms of Minos, in th' Ægean seas, Nought could the burning malady allay; The islanders implor'd the God of day, Who sent young Aristæus to their aid, By whom the fatal pestilence was staid. At his sire's call he left fair Phthia's land, Attended by a bold Arcadian band, Who from Lycaon their extraction boast, And sail'd to Ceos with his numerous host. He there an altar rais'd to showery Jove, And made oblation on the heights above To the red star that desolates the land, And to heaven's king; at whose supreme command Th' Etesian-winds, while forty days they blow, Refresh with balmy gales the soil below. Ev'n now the Cean priests pay rites divine Before the burning star begins to shine. Thus fame reports; and by these winds detain'd, With Phineus still the Argonauts remain'd. The grateful Thynians daily, while they staid, To their lov'd seer abundant stores convey'd. Yet, ere they leave this hospitable land, To the twelve Gods erect they on the strand An altar, and with sacrifice and pray'r Appease the powers of heaven, and to their ship repair, Eager their long-neglected oars to prove; Yet not unmindful of the timorous dove: Which safely fasten'd by a slender band Euphemus carry'd trembling in his hand. Quick from the stay they lopp'd the doubled cord: Minerva saw the heroes haste aboard: On a thin cloud she lighted from above, (The cloud upheld the mighty seed of Jove) And sped her voyage to the Euxine main, For much she lov'd the delegated train. So when some shepherd quits his native home, (As men adventurous much delight to roam) No roads too distant, or too long appear, In thought he sees, and thinks his mansion near; O'er sea, o'er land with keen enquiring eyes He views all ways, and in idea flies: Thus to the Thynian shore, from heaven above, Swift flew the daughter of imperial Jove. When now the heroes through the vast profound Reach the dire straits with rocks encompass'd round, Though boiling gulphs the sailing pine detain'd, Still on their way the labouring Grecians gain'd, When the loud-justling rocks increas'd their fears: The shores resounding thunder'd in their ears. High on the prow Euphemus took his stand, And held the dove that trembled in his hand. The rest with Tiphys on their strength rely'd, To shun the rocks, and stem the roaring tide. Soon, one sharp angle past, the joyful train Saw the cleft crags wide opening to the main. Euphemus loos'd the dove, the heroes stood Erect to see her skim the foaming flood. She through the rocks a ready passage found; The dire rocks met, and gave a dreadful sound. The salt-sea spray in clouds began to rise; Old ocean thunder'd; the cerulean skies Rebellow'd loudly with the fearful din; The caves below remurmur'd from within. O'er wave-worn cliffs, the coast's high margin o'er Boil'd the light foam, and whiten'd all the shore. Round whirl'd the ship; the rocks with rapid sway Lopp'd from the dove her steering tail away; Yet still securely through the straits she flew: Loud joy inspir'd the circumspective crew. But Tiphys urg'd the chiefs their oars to ply, For the rocks yawn'd, tremendous to the eye. Then terror seiz'd them, when with sudden shock The refluent billows forc'd them on the rock; With chilling fears was every nerve unstrung, While o'er their heads impending ruin hung. Before, behind they saw the spacious deep, When instant, lo! a billow, vast and steep, Still rises higher, and still wider spreads, And hangs a watery mountain o'er their heads. The heroes stoop'd, expecting by its fall That mighty billow would o'erwhelm them all; But Tiphys' art reliev'd the labouring oars: On Argo's keel the impetuous torrent pours, Which rais'd the ship above the rocks so high, She seem'd sublimely sailing in the sky. Euphemus hastening urg'd the valiant crew Their course with all their vigour to pursue. Shouting they plied their oars, but plied in vain; For the rough billows beat them back again. And as the heroes unremitting row, Their labouring oars were bent into a bow. Swift down the mountainous billows Argo glides, Like a huge cylinder along the tides, Entangled with thick, craggy rocks around, Her seams all bursting, and her planks unbound. In that nice moment the Tritonian maid To sacred Argo lent the timely aid. Her left-hand heav'd her from the craggy steep, Her right dismiss'd her gently to the deep: Then like an arrow from th' elastic yew, Swift o'er the foaming waves the vessel flew. Yet had the clashing rocks with adverse sway Torn the tall prow's embellishments away. When thus the Greeks had safely reach'd the main, To heaven Minerva wing'd her flight again. The parted rocks at once concurrent stood, Fix'd on one firm foundation in the flood: This had been long determined by the fates, If mortal ever past those dangerous straits. Now freed from fears, the Greeks with eager eyes View the broad ocean and serener skies: Their anxious doubts for Argo they dispel, And deem her rescued from the jaws of hell. Then Tiphys thus: ‘Sure to this ship we owe ‘That fearless safety we experience now. ‘For tho' wise Argus with ingenious art ‘Form'd the fair ship compact in every part, ‘Vigour divine propitious Pallas gave, ‘And power assign'd her o'er the wind and wave. ‘All now is safe: fear not thy haughty lord, ‘But mark, illustrious chief, the prophet's word, “The rocks escap'd, no future fears remain, “Your toils are easy, and your voyage plain.” Thus he; and steering through the spacious sea, Near fair Bithynia plough'd the liquid way. Then Jason mild the pilot thus address'd: “Why, Tiphys, this to me with grief oppress'd? “Yes, I have err'd—my faults afflict my soul: “When Pelias gave command without controul, “'Twas mine to've shunn'd this wild-projected plot, “Though instant death had been my certain lot. “Now fears and cares my tortur'd bosom rend; “I dread those ills that from the deep impend, “I dread the savage coast, and every place “Where dwells the bloody, or the barbarous race. “No peace by day, no sleep at night I take, “Since these brave chiefs assembled for my sake. “With cold indifference may'st thou look down, “For no man's safety anxious but thy own; “But I, the least solicitous for mine, “Feel for this friend's, that comrade's, and for thine. “Much shall I feel for all this martial band, “Unless they safe regain their native land.” Thus spoke the prince, his gallant host to try; With animating sounds they rend the sky. The loud acclaim was grateful to his ears, And thus he boldly hails his brave compeers: “Your valour, friends, encourages my soul: “And since no fears your gallant hearts controul, “Boldly will I each coward-thought repel, “Though doom'd to enter the abyss of hell. “For these rocks past, no dangers can dismay, “If we the counsel of the seer obey.” The Greeks applauding what their leader spoke, Ply their stout oars and bend to every stroke; And first by Rhebas, rapid stream, they fly, And where Colona's rocks invade the sky, And where the black-brow'd promontory low'rs, And where lov'd Phillis his broad current pours. There Dipsacus receiv'd, in days of yore, Young Phryxus landing on his friendly shore, When, exil'd from Orchomenos, he swam On the broad shoulders of the gold-fleec'd ram. For to that stream a nymph of rural race Bore Dipsacus, who, fearful of disgrace, Dwelt with his mother, and along the mead Chose, near his father's stream, his fleecy flocks to feed. The chiefs soon pass'd his celebrated fane, The river Calpis, and th' extended plain; And all the night, along the tranquil tide, And all the day their oars incessant ply'd. As when laborious steers, inur'd to toil, With the bright plow-share turn the stubborn soil; Sweat from their sides distils in foamy smoke; Their eyes obliquely roll beneath the yoke; Their scorching breath heaves quick with panting sound, While all day long they tread the weary ground: So toil'd the Greeks; nor yet the morning-light Had pass'd the doubtful confines of the night, But, faintly glimmering on this earthly ball, Produc'd what mortals morning-twilight call. To Thynia's neighbouring isle their course they bore, And safely landed on the desert shore, When bright Apollo shew his radiant face, From Lycia hastening to the Scythian race. His golden locks, that flow'd with grace divine, Hung clustering like the branches of the vine: In his left hand, his bow unbent he bore, His quiver pendent at his back he wore: The conscious island trembled as he trod, And the big rolling waves confess'd the God. Nor dar'd the heroes, seiz'd with dire dismay, The splendors of his countenance survey, But on the ground their downward eyes they cast: Meanwhile Apollo o'er the watery waste, And through thin ether on his journey flew. Then thus spoke Orpheus to the martial crew: “Let us, my honour'd chiefs, with joint acclaim “This island sacred to bright Phœbus name, “Who early here to all this host appear'd; “Here let an altar on the shore be rear'd, “And paid the rites divine: and if he deign “That safe we reach our native land again, “Young horned goats shall on his altars bleed, “And the choice thighs to Phœbus be decreed. “Now, comrades, due libations let us pay: “Be gracious, O be gracious, God of day!” Thus he: and some the stony altar raise, And some explore the forest's devious maze; Haply within its lone retreats to find A kid wild wandering, or a bounding hind: Latona's son soon led them to the prey; Then on the altar, blazing bright, they lay The choicest parts involv'd in sacred smoke, And fair Apollo, early God, invoke. Around the flame in sprightly dance they spring, And Iö Pæan, Iö Pæan sing. Then on the Thracian harp Oeager's son In soothing strains his tuneful tale begun: How once beneath Parnassus' rocky brow He lanch'd an arrow from his deadly bow, And the fell serpent slew; though young and fair And beardless yet, but grac'd with golden hair: (O prove propitious, thou whose radiant head Is deck'd with curls unclip'd, that never shed, Worthy thyself! Latona only knows With nicest art those ringlets to dispose) Corycian nymphs their joys in rapture show'd, And Iö, Iö Pæan call'd aloud: Encomium grateful to the God of day. Thus having prais'd him in the solemn lay, They swear devoutly, due libations made, To league for ever, and lend mutual aid; Then touch the hallow'd altar with their hands Concordant; and ev'n now a temple stands Sacred to Concord, by the Grecians rais'd, When here that mighty Deity they prais'd. Now the third morn began on earth to smile, When with fresh gales they left the lofty isle. The foaming Sangar at a distance seen, The Mariandine meads for ever green, And Lycus' winding waters they forsake All on the right, and Anthemoisia's lake. So fast before the wind the vessel went, Crack'd was the cordage, and the canvass rent: But the gale ceasing with the dawning day, Joyful they reach the Acherusian bay, Begirt with rocks so towering tall and steep, They frown tremendous on Bithynia's deep; And yet so firmly founded in the main, The raging billows round them roar in vain: Above, upon the promontory's brow, Umbrageous planes in beauteous order grow. Thence, downward, thro' a deep and dreary dell, Descends the path-way to the cave of hell, With woods and shaggy rocks obscure; from whence Exhaling vapours, chilly, damp and dense, Scatter hoar frost along the whitening way, Which melts before the sun's meridian ray. On these rough cliffs, which many a storm molests, The pleasing power of silence never rests. From hollow caverns through the leafy boughs, Above, the whistling wind for ever blows; And while mad billows lash the sounding shores, Below, the raging main for ever roars. There, bursting from the promontory's sides, Sad Acheron along the valley glides; Deep-hollow'd beds his turbid streams convey, As eastward to the main he winds his way. This sable flood, in ancient story fam'd, The Megarensians Soönautes nam'd In after ages, when their course they bore By ocean to the Mariandine shore: For when the deep in deathful billows heav'd, This peaceful port their shatter'd ships receiv'd. To this the labouring Grecians bent their way, Row'd round the cape, and anchor'd in the bay. When Lycus and his Mariandine host, Lycus, the mighty monarch of the coast, Knew these brave Greeks who Amycus had slain, They welcom'd Jason and his conquering train: But most on Pollux fix'd their wondering eyes, And view'd him as a hero from the skies: For long the fierce Bebrycians' rude alarms Had rouz'd the Mariandyni to arms. That day, the Grecian band with one consent To the king's hospitable palace went: Cheerful they there on choicest dainties din'd, And there with converse sweet regal'd the mind. Then Jason to the king recounts the name, And race of all these chosen sons of fame, Who lent their aid at Pelias' dire command; Their strange adventures on the Lemnian land; What griefs, what woes at Cyzicus they bore; And how they landed on the Mysian shore, Where Hercules, distress'd his friend to find, They left at land, unwillingly, behind. What Glaucus spoke prophetic from the main, How with his subjects Amycus was slain, The prince relates: what Phineus poor and old, Worn out with sufferings to the chiefs foretold; How thro' Cyanean rocks they safely steer'd, And in what isle the God of day appear'd. The king rejoic'd his guests so well had sped, But griev'd that Hercules was left, and said: ‘Think how, my friends, this hero's aid deny'd, ‘Rashly ye tempt a length of seas untry'd. ‘Full well I knew that valiant son of fame, ‘When here on foot thro' Lydia's coast he came ‘(For here my hospitable father dwelt) ‘To fetch Hippolita's embroider'd belt. ‘The hero found me then a beardless swain, ‘Mourning my brother by the Mysians slain; ‘(The nation dearly lov'd the blooming chief, ‘And still lament in elegies of grief) ‘Then at the funeral games he prov'd his might, ‘And vanquish'd Titias in the gauntlet-fight; ‘Tho' young and stout, and eager for the fray, ‘From his bruis'd jaws he dash'd the teeth away. ‘The Mysian country, and the Phrygian plains ‘The conqueror added to my sire's domains; ‘And the rude nations that Bithynia till, ‘To foaming Rhebas and Colona's hill; ‘And Paphlagonia to its utmost bounds, ‘Which sable Billis with his waves surrounds. ‘But now proud Amycus, and all his host, ‘Since Hercules has left the neighbouring coast, ‘Have spoil'd my realms, and spread their hostile bands ‘Wide as where Hipias' streams enrich the lands. ‘At length their lawless insolence they rue, ‘And by your hands have suffer'd vengeance due. ‘And sure some God afforded his relief ‘When Pollux slew that proud Bebrycian chief. ‘I for this deed my due regard will show; ‘'Tis what the meanest to the mighty owe. ‘My son, your comrade, shall at my command ‘Attend o'er distant seas your gallant band: ‘O'er distant seas, with Dascylus your guide, ‘You still with faithful friends shall be supply'd, ‘Far as Thermodon rolls his foaming tide. ‘Meanwhile on yon bold cape that mates the skies ‘To Leda's sons a sacred fane shall rise, ‘Admir'd by all that cross the boundless main, ‘For all shall venerate the sacred fane: ‘To them will I, as to the powers divine, ‘Some fruitful acres near the town assign.’ Conversing thus, the genial feast they share, And to the ship at early day repair: With his brave son the friendly Lycus went, Who store of viands to the ship had sent. 'Twas here the cruel destinies decreed That Idmon, fam'd for augury, should bleed: The fate of others he had oft foreshown, But fail'd, unhappy! to prevent his own. Here, in a covert near the reedy flood, A fell wild boar lay deep immers'd in mud. With horrid tusks so dreadful he appear'd, The fountain-nymphs the savage monster fear'd: No living wight in miry marsh or moor E'er saw so fierce, so horrible a boar. On the lake's verge as luckless Idmon stood, From his close covert, in the reedy mud, Up sprung the furious beast with might and main, Tore the chief's thigh, and snapp'd the bone in twain; He groans, he falls, and on the bank he lies, His griev'd companions answer to his cries; When Peleus instantly approaching near, Lanch'd at the boar his unavailing spear: But Idas aim'd his pointed dart so well, Low in the marsh the dying monster fell. The chiefs with Idmon to the ship retir'd, Who deeply groaning in their arms expir'd. Immers'd in grief, they now neglect to sail; For three whole days their comrade they bewail; But on the fourth, with pensive sorrow, paid The last sad honours due to Idmon's shade. The king, the people join'd the mournful crew, And, loud-lamenting, numerous victims slew: They dug the grave, and on the greensword raise A tomb on which posterity will gaze: For near the tomb a tall wild olive grows, Beneath the cape, and beautifully blows. Me would the Nine commission to unfold This truth, which Phœbus had long since foretold, This, this is he, the tutelary lord, Henceforth to be by mighty states ador'd: For here Bæotians and Megarians join'd, Near the wild olive wavering in the wind, To build a city; though due honours they To Agamestor, not to Idmon, pay. Who fell beside? for, lo! the chiefs intend Another tomb for some lamented friend. Ev'n now two mournful monuments appear: Tiphys, Fame says, was stretch'd upon the bier. Him cruel fate ordain'd no more to roam; He died far distant from his native home. For while to Idmon funeral rites they pay, Untimely sickness snatch'd the chief away. Then heart-felt sadness seiz'd the pensive train, Who, prostrate on the margin of the main, Forgetful of their necessary food, Mourn'd in sad silence to the roaring flood. For they, now skilful Tiphys is no more, Despair'd returning to their native shore; And here had staid, with bitter grief oppress'd, Had not Saturnia in Ancæus' breast Breath'd courage: him Astypalæa bore, Near winding Imbrasus on Samos' shore, To ocean's God; a chief expert to guide The flying vessel o'er the foaming tide. Then thus to Peleus, Neptune's valiant son, By heaven inspir'd, in cheering terms begun: ‘Ill suits the brave in foreign climes to stay, ‘And waste, O Peleus, precious time away. ‘I left not Samos less for sailing skill'd ‘Than fierce contention in the fighting field. ‘For Argo cherish not one abject fear, ‘Since many skill'd, besides myself, are here. ‘And he, to whom the steerage we ordain, ‘Will safely guide the vessel o'er the main. ‘'Tis thine to stimulate the fainting crew ‘With ready oars their voyage to pursue.’ He spoke, and transport touch'd the Phthian's breast, Instant he rose, and thus the host address'd: “Why are we here by fruitless grief detain'd? “Two friends are dead, and this the fates ordain'd; “Yet many pilots in this host remain, “To steer firm Argo o'er the watery plain. “To sorrows unavailing bid adieu! “Let us, bold peers, our destin'd course pursue.” He said, and Jason anxious thus reply'd; ‘Where are those pilots, say, our course to guide? ‘For those whom late we boasted as the best ‘And ablest chiefs, are most with grief oppress'd. ‘I therefore deem a like sad fate attends ‘On us, as on our late departed friends, ‘If neither in Æeta's ports we moor, ‘Nor thro' those rocks regain our native shore, ‘But here inactive and inglorious stay, ‘Years following years, and linger life away.’ He spoke; Ancæus seiz'd the steerage, driv'n By power instinctive from the queen of heav'n. Erginus next the glorious charge desir'd; Euphemus, Nauplius to the helm aspir'd. But these the congregated chiefs declin'd, And bold Ancæus to the post assign'd. With the twelfth rising morn the heroes sail; Favonius breath'd a favourable gale; And soon they leave sad Acheron behind, Then give the swelling canvass to the wind: On the smooth sea the ship serenely rides, And light along the liquid level glides. Ere long with stretching sails the coast they gain, Where broad Callichorus augments the main. To Thebes returning from his Indian fights, Here Bacchus solemniz'd mysterious rites, The dance before the sacred cave ordain'd, And here full many a doleful night remain'd. This name the country to the river gave, Callichorus; and Aulion to the cave. Still as their course the daring Greeks pursue, The monument of Sthenelus they view. With honours grac'd, obtain'd in realms afar, Returning from the Amazonian war, On the bleak shore (Alcides at his side) Pierc'd by a fatal dart the hero died. Slow sail'd they on, for, eager to survey His kindred warriours on the watery way, At his request, from her infernal coast Pluto's grim queen releas'd the pensive ghost. The pensive ghost beheld with eager ken From the tall monument the ship and men. As arm'd for war the martial phantom seem'd; Four crests high-towering on his helmet beam'd, With purple rays intolerably bright; Then soon it sunk beneath the shades of night. In mute amazement stood the Grecian host; But Mopsus counsel'd to appease the ghost With offerings due; the chiefs approach the strand, And round the tomb of Sthenelus they stand. They pour libations, and the victims slay, And on the fire the destin'd offerings lay. Apart, to guardian Phœbus next they raise An altar meet, and bid the victims blaze. Here Orpheus plac'd his lyre for music fam'd; Apollo's altar hence was Lyra nam'd. And now, invited by the favouring gales, They climb the ship and spread their swelling sails; Swift o'er the deep the winged vessel flies, Swift as the rapid hawk that cleaves the skies, And lightly thro' the liquid ether springs, Nor moves, self-poiz'd, his wide-expanded wings. Thence by Parthenius sail'd the social train, The gentlest stream that mingles with the main. Fatigued with traversing the mazy grove, Here, ere she re-ascends the courts of Jove, The chaste Diana, huntress of the wood, Bathes her fair limbs, and gambols in the flood. Then during night by Sesamus they sail, And Erythinus rising o'er the vale; By Cromna and Crobrialus, and where Thy groves, Cytorus, ever green appear. Thence with the rising sun they stoutly row Near where Carambis lifts his rocky brow. All day, all night with unremitted oar They coast along Ægialus's shore. Then to the Syrian clime the heroes sped, Where Jove, by hasty promises misled, Sinope plac'd, and, all she wish'd to claim, Gave her the honours of a virgin's name. For, know, the God, by Love's strong power oppress'd, Promis'd to grant whate'er she might request: And this request th' insidious damsel made, That her virginity might never fade. Hence Phœbus foil'd could no one wish obtain; Hence winding Alys wooed the maid in vain. No mortal force such virtue could o'ercome, Defeat Jove's promise, and impair her bloom. Here dwelt Deïmachus's offspring fam'd, Deileon, Autolycus and Phloglus nam'd, What time they ceas'd with Hercules to roam, And at Sinope found a settled home. They, when they saw the bold Thessalian band, Met them on shore and welcom'd them to land; And, loathing longer in these climes to stay, Join'd the brave crew, and with them sail'd away. Bless'd with the zephyr's breeze that briskly blew, Near Halys' stream and Isis' sail'd the crew; Near Syria's coast, and, ere night's shades abound, Near th' Amazonian cape, for many a bay renown'd. Where Hercules surpriz'd, in days of yore, Bold Menalippe wandering on the shore: A belt Hippolyta her sister paid, And for this ransom he restor'd the maid. Here in Thermodon's bay firm Argo moor'd; For lash'd with tempests the vex'd ocean roar'd. No river like the fam'd Thermodon leads Such numerous currents o'er the fertile meads: A hundred streams to him their waters owe; Yet from one source, one only source they flow. On Amazonian hills, that reach the skies, The great Thermodon first begins to rise; Hence soon emerging many a course he takes, Sinks but to mount, and various channels makes. The different streams from different founts distil, In soft meanders wandering down the hill; Some public notice and fair titles claim, Some flow obscurely, and without a name; But confluent soon, along the winding plain, He rolls his waves, and foams o'er half the main. Had the Greeks landed on this hostile coast, War would have soon pursu'd the gallant host: (For the fierce Amazons regard not right, Strife is their sport, and battles their delight: From Mars and Harmony these warlike maids Sprung where Acmonius spreads its bowery shades) But favour'd with the soft Favonian wind, The heroes left the crooked shore behind, Where the bold Amazons, perceiv'd from far, Stood sheath'd in arms, prepar'd for speedy war. Not in one city dwelt this martial band, But in three parties scatter'd o'er the land: The first tribe at Themiscyra remain'd, O'er this Hippolyta, their empress, reign'd; There dwelt the fair Lycastian dames apart, Here the Chadesians, skill'd to lance the dart. Th' ensuing day the delegated band Approach'd with oars the rough Chalybian land; Whose sons ne'er yoke their oxen to the plough, Nor healing plants, nor fruits delicious know: Nor aught delight they in th' irriguous mead, Retir'd and still, their fleecy flocks to feed; But they dig iron from the mountain's side, And by this ore are nature's wants supply'd. Devoid of toil ne'er beam'd Aurora's ray, And dust and smoke obscur'd the dismal day. From thence they pass where Tibarenians till, Sacred to Jove, the Genetæan hill. Here, when the teeming wives are brought to bed, Their groaning husbands hang the drooping head; Equal attendance with their wives they claim; The same their diet, and their baths the same. Next by the sacred hill their oars impel Firm Argo, where the Mossynœcians dwell. In towers they live, of solid timber fram'd, Mossynes call'd, and thence the nation nam'd: Of manners strange; for they with care conceal Those deeds which others openly reveal; And actions, that in secret should be done, Perform in public and before the sun: For, like the monsters of the bristly drove, In public they perform the feats of love. Exalted in his tower that mates the sky, The monarch here dispenses law from high: But if his judgment err, this rigid state Condemns their chief, and starving is his fate. These nations past, with unremitting oar They reach, Aretias, thy sea-girt shore. Then sunk the breezes with the closing day, When down the sky descending they survey A winged monster of enormous might, Which toward the ship precipitates her flight. Her wings she shook, and from her pinions flung A dart-like quill, which on Oïleus hung; Down his left shoulder swift it fell: no more, Faint and enfeebled, could he hold his oar. In silence long the Grecian heroes gaze, And view the feathery javelin with amaze. But Erybotes, soon approaching near, Extracted from the chief the winged spear; Then from his side his pendent belt unbound, And wrapp'd that bandage o'er the gaping wound. When, lo! a second bird appear'd in view, But ready Clytius first had bent his yew; By his keen shaft the feather'd monster slain Fast by the ship fell headlong in the main. Then thus Amphidamas: ‘My friends, ye know, ‘And these obscene voracious fiends foreshow ‘Aretias near: then list to what I say, ‘Fruitless are shafts to drive these pests away; ‘But, would you here a fit reception find, ‘Recall th' advice of Phineus to your mind. ‘For when Alcides to Arcadia went ‘Well arm'd with arrows, on his toils intent, ‘From the Stymphalian lake he fail'd to fright ‘These ravenous Harpies (I beheld the sight) ‘But when he rung a cymbal with his spear; ‘The clanging cymbal fill'd the birds with fear: ‘In wild confusion far away they fly, ‘And with shrill clamours pierce the distant sky. ‘'Tis ours to practise this expulsive art; ‘But hear ye first the counsel I impart: ‘Let half our crew, in glittering armour dress'd, ‘Nod, as by turns they row, the high-plum'd crest; ‘The rest bright spears and swords and shields provide, ‘And meet dispose them round the vessel's side. ‘Then all at once your voices raise on high, ‘And with loud pealing shouts assail the sky; ‘The deafening clamours, the protended spears, ‘And nodding crests will fill the birds with fears. ‘And when Aretias' barren isle ye gain, ‘Ring your broad bucklers, and all shout amain.’ He spoke, the chiefs approv'd the wise design; High on their heads the brazen helmets shine, Whose purple crests wav'd dreadful in the wind; To these alternate were stout oars assign'd; The rest with care their vessel's side conceal'd With glittering spears, and many a shining shield. As when industrious builders cover o'er With tiles the walls their hands had rais'd before; In chequer'd squares they decorate the roof, And make it fair to view, and tempest-proof: Thus they with shields, dispos'd in order due, Shelter'd their vessel, and adorn'd it too. As when embattled hosts their foes assail, Tumultuous shouts, and martial sounds prevail; So from the ship loud clamours pierc'd the sky; No more the Greeks their feather'd foes descry: Rattling their bucklers, near the land they drew, And far away the winged furies flew. So when great Jove on close-throng'd cities pours From hyperborean clouds his haily show'rs; Within, the dwellers sit in peace profound, Nor heed the rattling storms that rage around; In vain the hail descends, the tempests roar, Their roofs from harm were well secur'd before: Thus on their shields the furies shot their quills, Then clamouring vanish'd to far distant hills. Say, Muse, why Phineus counsel'd here to land, On Mars's isle, this delegated band? And what advantage could the Grecians gain From all the toils and perils of the main? To fam'd Orchomenos, with favouring gale, From Æa's walls the sons of Phrixus sail, Their grandsire's vast inheritance to share, Who dying left this voyage to their care. Near Mars's island on this signal day The sons of Phrixus plough'd the liquid way. But Jove ordain'd that Boreas' blasts should blow, While moist Arcturus soak'd the vales below. First on the mountains, rising by degrees, All day rough Boreas shook the trembling trees; Then, night approaching, he with hideous sound Roll'd the big wave, and heav'd the vast profound. No stars appear translucent thro' the clouds, But gloomy darkness every object shrouds. The sons of Phrixus, tost by whelming waves, With horror shudder'd at the watery graves; For the fierce blast, impell'd with might and main, Tore all their canvass, split the ship in twain And dash'd to pieces; but by heaven's kind aid On a large fragment of the wreck convey'd, The winds and waves the trembling brothers bore Aghast, and half expiring to the shore. Instant in floods descended copious rain, Drench'd the whole island, and increas'd the main; (These shores, the neighbouring coast, and sacred hill The rude, the barbarous Mossynœcians till) Borne on a broken plank, the forceful blast The sons of Phrixus on this island cast, Who met the Grecians with the rising sun; Ceas'd was the rain, and Argus thus begun: ‘Adjur'd by Jove, whose circumspective ken ‘Surveys the conduct and the cares of men, ‘Whate'er your name or race, our tale attend, ‘And to the wretched your assistance lend. ‘The raging storms that Neptune's empire sweep, ‘Have wreck'd our luckless vessel in the deep; ‘To you we pray, if pity touch your heart, ‘Some scanty raiment for our wants impart; ‘The sons of misery for mercy call; ‘To one low level sorrow sinks us all. ‘They who to prostrate suppliants lend an ear, ‘The laws of hospitable Jove revere. ‘All-present he hath listen'd to our pray'r, ‘And sinking sav'd us with a parent's care.’ Then Æson's son (fulfilling Phineus' plan) Thus question'd mild the miserable man; “But first, of truth observant, frankly tell, “In what far region of the world ye dwell; “What business call'd you from your native coast, “What race ye sprung from, and what names ye boast.” Then Argus thus: ‘Ye, sure, have heard the fame ‘Of Phrixus, who from Greece to Æa came. ‘To great Æeta's citadel he swam ‘Supported on the shoulders of the ram, ‘Whose fleece now high-suspended ye behold, ‘By Hermes metamorphos'd into gold. ‘On the tall oak's high top it hangs in view, ‘The ram to Jove, propitious, Phrixus slew. ‘The generous king receiv'd him as his guest, ‘And with undower'd Chalciope he bless'd. ‘From these we sprung; but Phrixus breathes no more, ‘His bones lie buried on the Colchian shore. ‘We now to fam'd Orchomenos repair, ‘The wide domains of Athamas to share; ‘Such were the last injunctions of our sire: ‘Our business this—if ye our names require, ‘This Cytisorus, that will Phrontis claim, ‘He surnam'd Melas, Argus is my name.’ He spoke: the Argonauts with still amaze, And secret transport on the strangers gaze. Then Jason mark'd the much-enduring man, And thus with mild benevolence began: “Friends as ye are, and near relations too, “To us for succour not in vain ye sue. “Cretheus and Athamas their sire the same; “And Cretheus was my honour'd grandsire's name: “With these companions join'd, I sail from Greece “To Colchos, famous for the golden fleece— “Some distant day, at ease may we relate “These strange events, and all our various fate. “Now shall warm robes to clothe your limbs be giv'n, “We meet conducted by the hand of heav'n.” He said, and from the ship rich vestments sent; Then to the sacred fane of Mars they went. From fleecy flocks they drain'd the life-warm blood, And all devoutly round the altar stood; This, of small stones compos'd, was plac'd before The lofty temple's double-folding door: (Within the fane a stone of sable hue Stood where the Amazons their victims slew; Who held it lawless, when they sojourn'd here, To slay the sheep, or sacrifice the steer; Instead of these the full-fed, pamper'd steed Was doom'd, a victim at this fane, to bleed.) These rites dispatch'd, and hunger's rage repress'd, Thus Æson's son the listening host address'd: “Impartial Jove the race of man regards; “The bad he punishes, the just rewards: “As from a bloody stepdame's rage of yore “He sav'd your sire, and blest with ample store, “So he preserv'd you from the whelming deep, “And in this vessel will securely keep; “Whether for Æa in our ship ye sail, “Or to far Phthia court the favouring gale. “For this fam'd ship of Pelion's pines was made; “And form'd by Argus, with Minerva's aid; “But storms had lash'd her, ere, with hideous shock, “She reach'd those straits, where rock encounters rock. “Then lend your aid to gain the golden fleece, “And be our guides to bring it back to Greece. “Jove seems incens'd, and we this voyage take, “To sooth his anger, and for Phrixus' sake.” Ardent he spoke; but they despair'd to find, Æeta of so tractable a mind, To yield the fleece: then Argus thus replies, Alarm'd and troubled at their bold emprise; ‘Whate'er our powers can grant, or wishes gain, ‘The sons of Greece shall never ask in vain. ‘But proud Æeta, cruel and severe, ‘I loath the tyrant, and his power I fear; ‘The Sun his sire, so fame relates, he boasts; ‘Unnumber'd subjects guard his ample coasts; ‘For mighty strength he stands renown'd afar, ‘And voice terrific as the God of war. ‘The golden prize a monstrous dragon keeps; ‘Hard task to seize it, for he never sleeps. ‘Earth on rough Caucasus a being gave ‘To this fierce beast near Typhaonia's cave, ‘Where huge Typhœus, as old stories prove, ‘Was struck by lightning from almighty Jove, ‘When fierce in arms against heaven's king he stood; ‘From his head issu'd warm corrupted blood; ‘To Nysa's hills, to Nysa's plains he flies, ‘And now beneath Serbonian marshes lies. He said; distress'd so sad a tale to hear, On every countenance sat pallid fear; When Peleus thus with confidence reply'd, And gave that courage which their fears deny'd: “Despair not, friend; for we disdain to yield, “Nor dread to meet Æeta in the field. “We too are skill'd in war, and draw our line “From godlike chiefs, and origin divine. “Incens'd should he the fleecy gold detain, “He'll ask, I trust, the Colchians' aid in vain.” Conversing thus the chiefs their thoughts express'd, And sated with repast reclin'd to rest. With rising morn the gently-breathing gales Play'd round the pine, and fill'd the swelling sails; The swelling sails expanded by the wind Soon left Aretias' barren shore behind; And swiftly skimming o'er the watery vast, The Philyræan isle at eve they past; Where Saturn first fair Philyra survey'd, When on Olympus he the Titans sway'd, (Nurs'd by the fierce Curetes, yet a child, Young Jove was hid in Cretan caverns wild) Unknown to Rhea he the maid compress'd; But soon to Rhea was the crime confess'd; Detected Saturn left his bed with speed, And sprung all-vigorous as a mane-crown'd steed. Swift fled fair Philyra, abash'd with shame, And to the hills of Thessaly she came: Fam'd Chiron sprung from this embrace so odd, Ambiguous, half a horse, and half a God. From thence they sail by long Macronian strands, And where Bechira's ample coast expands; Shores where Byzerians wander far and wide, And fierce Sapirians, stigmatiz'd for pride; And favour'd by the soft impelling wind, Leave numerous coasts and lands unnam'd behind: And, sailing swiftly o'er the waves, survey, Far on the Pontic main, an opening bay; Then, Caucasus, thy hills were seen on high, That rear their rocky summits in the sky; Fix'd to these rocks Prometheus still remains, For ever bound in adamantine chains: On the rude cliffs a ravenous eagle breeds, That on the wretch's entrails ever feeds. The Grecians saw him, ere th' approach of night, Soar high in air, loud hissing in his flight: Around the ship he flew in airy rings, The sails all shivering as he shook his wings: Not as a light aerial bird he soars, But moves his pinions like well-polish'd oars. The ravenous bird now rushing from the skies, Sudden, they heard Prometheus' piercing cries: The heavens re-echoed to the doleful sound, While the fell eagle gnaw'd the recent wound. Till gorg'd with flesh the bird of Jove they spy'd Again descending from the mountain's side. Night now approaching, near the land they drew, And Argus well his native country knew; For, Phasis, thy wide-spreading flood they gain, And the last limits of the Pontic main. At length arriv'd, so many dangers past, They furl the mainsail, and they lower the mast: Their bending oars the mighty stream divide; The stream receives them on his foaming tide. All on the left, in ancient rolls renown'd, Rise Æa's walls with glittering turrets crown'd; And on the right the field, not distant far, And grove, both sacred to the God of war; Where on an oak the fleece, suspended high, A dragon guards with ever-watchful eye. Then Jason hastes, impatient to consign To the pure stream the unpolluted wine, And from a golden vase fulfils the rite divine, Sacred to earth, to Gods that guard the coasts, And ancient heroes' long-departed ghosts: For their protection he preferr'd his pray'r, To keep the ship with tutelary care. Then thus Ancæus: ‘Numerous perils past, ‘Colchos and Phasis we behold at last; ‘Behoves you now your sage advice to lend, ‘Whether to treat Æeta as a friend, ‘With speech accordant, and compliance bland, ‘Or in rough terms the golden prize demand.’ Thus he; but Jason urg'd, at Argus' call, High up the sedgy stream the ship to haul; Which, undisturb'd, might there at anchor ride In the calm bosom of the peaceful tide: There sought the chiefs the blessings of repose, And slept secure till grateful morning rose. END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. THE ARGUMENT. Juno and Pallas intercede with Venus. They request that she would persuade Cupid to inspire Medea with love for Jason. Venus consents; and the shafts of Cupid, at her suit, have their desired effect. Jason, Augeas and Telamon proceed to the court of Æeta, where they are hospitably entertained. But, having heard the occasion of their voyage, Æeta is incensed, and refuses to bestow the Golden Fleece on Jason, unless on such terms, as he presumed he durst not comply with. The passion of Medea for Jason is described with great simplicity and delicacy. Medea early in the morning repairs to the temple of Hecate: thither Jason, at the suggestion of Mopsus, follows her. The poet dwells particularly on their interview and conference. Medea instructs him how to subdue the brazen bulls and armies of giants. With Jason's combat, and the success of it, the book concludes. Come, heavenly maid, thy timely succour bring, And teach thy poet, Erato, to sing, How Jason, favour'd by the Colchian maid, To Grecian realms the golden prize convey'd. Thy songs the rites of Cyprian bliss proclaim, And in young virgins raise the melting flame; For the soft passion thy behests approve, And Erato's the kindred name of love. Conceal'd in sedges as the herces lie, Juno and Pallas mark'd them from the sky; Apart from all the Gods their seats they took In heaven's high hall, and thus Saturnia spoke: “Daughter of Jove, thy sage advice impart, “By what nice fraud, what well-dissembled art, “These venturous chiefs shall gain the golden fleece, “And safe convey it to the realms of Greece. “Say, shall they call entreaties to their aid? “Will soft address the wayward king persuade, “So fam'd for fierce barbarity and pride? “No art, no effort must be left untry'd.” She said; and Pallas thus: ‘O Queen, I find ‘The same ideas rising in my mind: ‘To lend assistance to the Grecian train ‘My heart is willing, but my counsel vain.’ This said, their minds on various projects ran, On earth their eyes were fix'd, when Juno thus began: “To Venus instant let us speed our way, “(Her soft persuasions Cupid will obey) “Intreat her that the wily God inspire “Medea's soul with love's unconquer'd fire, “Love for great Æson's son; applauding Greece “Will by her aid regain the glorious fleece.” She said; Minerva patronis'd the plan, And thus with mild benevolence began: ‘I, who arose from Jove's immortal brain, ‘Stranger to love, his pleasure or his pain, ‘Thy sage proposal from my soul approve; ‘Do thou explain it to the queen of love.’ This said, with speed the two immortals came To the grand mansion of the Cyprian dame, Which crippled Vulcan rais'd, when first he led The Paphian goddess to his nuptial bed. The gate they pass, and to the dome retire Where Venus oft regales the God of fire: (He to his forge had gone at early day, A floating isle contain'd it on the bay, Here wondrous works by fire's fierce power he wrought, And on his anvil to perfection brought.) Fronting the door, all lovely and alone, Sat Cytherea on a polish'd throne. Adown the shoulders of the heavenly fair, In easy ringlets flow'd her flaxen hair; And with a golden comb, in matchless grace, She taught each lock its most becoming place. She saw the deities approach her dome, And from her hand dismiss'd the golden comb; Then rose respectful, all with beauty grac'd, And on rich thrones the great immortals plac'd; Resum'd her seat, and with a ready hand Bound her loose ringlets, and thus question'd bland: ‘What cause, ye visitants from heaven, relate, ‘Has brought such guests to Cytherea's gate? ‘Ye who excel in high Olympus' sphere, ‘Such mighty deities, and strangers here?’ Then thus Saturnia: “Wantonly you jest, “When pressing grief sits heavy on our breast. “Now in the Phasis, with his warlike train, “Great Jason moors, the golden fleece to gain: “For that fam'd chief, and for his martial host, “Dire fears alarm us, but for Jason most: “This potent arm, whate'er our prowess can, “Shall snatch from misery the gallant man, “Tho' far as hell he, rash adventurer! go, “To free Ixion, link'd in chains of woe; “Lest Pelias proudly heaven's decrees deride, “Who on my altars sacrifice deny'd. “Nay more, young Jason claims my love and grace, “Whom late I met returning from the chace, “Returning met, as o'er the world I stray'd, “And human kind, and human works survey'd; “Hard by Araurus I beheld the man, “Wide o'er its banks whose rapid currents ran; “(From snow-clad hills, in torrents loud and strong, “Roar'd the swoln streams the rugged rocks among.) “He on his back, though like a crone I stood, “Securely brought me o'er the foaming flood; “This won my love, a love for ever true, “Nor will the haughty-minded Pelias rue “His flagrant crimes, till you propitious deign “To speed my Jason to his Greece again.” She spoke, and Venus stood amaz'd to find The queen of heaven to humble prayer inclin'd; Then thus familiar said: ‘O wife of Jove, ‘Basest of beings call the queen of love, ‘Unless her every word and work conspire ‘To give you all the succour you require: ‘All that my hand, my feeble hand can do, ‘Shall unrewarded be perform'd for you.’ Then Juno thus: “Not difficult the task; “No mighty force, no strength of arm I ask. “Bid gentle Love the Colchian maid inspire, “And for my Jason fan the rising fire; “If kind she prove, he gains the golden fleece, “And by her subtle aid conducts it safe to Greece.” Love's queen replied: ‘Cupid, ye powers divine, ‘Will reverence your injunctions more than mine: ‘Your looks will awe him, tho', devoid of shame, ‘Of me the urchin makes eternal game, ‘Oft he provokes my spleen, and then I vow, ‘Enrag'd, I'll break his arrows and his bow: “Restrain your ire,” exclaims the sneering elf, “Lest you find reason to upbraid yourself.” At this the Powers with smiles each other view'd, And Venus thus her woeful tale pursu'd: ‘Others may ridicule the pains I feel, ‘Nor boots it all my sufferings to reveal. ‘But since ye jointly importune my aid, ‘Cupid shall yield, and Venus be obey'd.’ She said; and Juno press'd her hand and smil'd, Then answered thus, benevolent and mild: “O grant this boon; do instant as you say; “Chide not the boy, and he will soon obey.” This said, both hasten'd to the realms above, And left the mansions of the queen of love: The Cyprian goddess o'er Olympus flies, To find her son in every dale she pries, Through heaven's gay meads the queen pursu'd her way, And found him there with Ganymede at play. Him Jove translated to the blest abodes, And, fam'd for beauty, plac'd among the Gods. With golden dice, like boon compeers they play'd: Love in his hollow hand some cubes convey'd, Resolv'd to cheat young Ganymede with those, While on his cheeks the conscious crimson rose. The Phrygian boy was vanquish'd to his cost, Two dice alone remain'd, and those he lost. Silent he sat in dull dejected state, Enrag'd that Cupid should deride his fate: His loss increasing with protracted play, He went a wretch with empty hands away, Nor saw he Venus: she her Cupid took Fast by the cheek, and thus upbraiding spoke: ‘And can you laugh, you sly, deceitful elf? ‘Such tricks will bring a scandal on yourself. ‘But haste, my Cupid, my commands obey, ‘And a nice plaything shall your toils repay, ‘What once to Jove dear Adrastæa gave, ‘When Jove was nourish'd in the Cretan cave, ‘A sweet round ball; oh! keep it for my sake, ‘A finer ball not Vulcan's hands can make. ‘Gold are the circles, beauteous to behold, ‘And all the finish'd seams are wrought in gold; ‘But all so close they scarcely can be found: ‘And the pale ivy winds its wreaths around. ‘If high in air you fling this ball afar, ‘It shines and glimmers like a radiant star. ‘This prize I'll give, if you propitious prove, ‘And lure Medea to the toils of love; ‘Fire all her soul for Jason: haste, away; ‘The favour is diminish'd by delay.’ She said, and Cupid listening long'd to hear, For her sweet words are music to his ear. He ceas'd his pastime, and with both his hands Hangs on the Goddess, and the ball demands. She kiss'd her boy, and press'd him to her cheek, And fondly smiling thus she answer'd meek: ‘By thee, my son, and by myself I swear, ‘By all that's sacred, and by all that's dear, ‘This ball I'll give thee, if thy fatal dart ‘Thou fix unerring in Medea's heart.’ This said; he gather'd all his dice with haste, And in his mother's splendid lap he plac'd. Then snatch'd his bow and quiver from the ground, And to his back with golden girdle bound. From Jove's all-fertile plains he swift withdrew, And thro' Olympus' golden portals flew. Thence the descent is easy from the sky, Where the two poles erect their heads on high, Where the tall mountains their rough tops display, And where the sun first gives the radiant day. Hence you behold the fertile earth below, The winding streams, the cliffs' aerial brow, Cities extended on the distant plain, And thro' the vast expanse the roaring main. On the broad Phasis, in a sedgy bay, Stretch'd on the deck the Grecian heroes lay; Till call'd to council rose each godlike man, And Jason thus the conference began: “To you, my comrades, be my counsel known, “'Tis yours that counsel with success to crown. “One common cause our great emprise is made; “The common cause demands the common aid. “He who unutter'd can his counsel keep, “Stays our resailing o'er the sounding deep. “I to Æeta's court will speed my way, “The rest well-arm'd shall in the vessel stay; “With me shall go, the palace to explore, “Phrixus' brave sons, and two associates more. “First will I prove the power of soft address “To gain the fleece; complacence wins success. “If in his arms he sternly should confide, “And spurn our claims with insolence and pride, “Consult we whether, when such powers oppress, “By arms or arts to free us from distress. “Be force the last alternative we take, “For soothing speeches deep impressions make; “And oft, where force and martial prowess fail, “The milder powers of eloquence prevail. “Once king Æeta kind reception gave “To blameless Phrixus, when escap'd the wave “He fled from Ino's unrelenting hate, “And the dire altars that denounc'd his fate. “Savage or social, all alike approve “The sacred rites of hospitable Jove.” He said: the Greeks his sage advice rever'd; No voice dissentient thro' the host was heard: Augeas then, and Telamon attends, And with them Phrixus' sons, his faithful friends; Jason they follow: he thy peaceful wand, All-sapient Hermes, brandish'd in his hand. Soon from the ship they gain the rising ground, Mount every steep, and o'er the marshes bound, Till Circe's plain they reach; in many a row Here humble shrubs and lonely willows grow; On whose tall branches, wavering o'er the fen, Suspended hang the carcases of men. At Colchos still this barbarous rite prevails: They never burn the bodies of the males, Nor deep in earth their decent limbs compose, And with sepulchral dust the dead enclose; But in raw hides they hang them high in air: And yet, that earth may equal portions share, Departed females to the grave they doom, (Such are their rites) and close them in the tomb. The chiefs advance; but friendly Juno shrouds Her favourite heroes in a veil of clouds, That none, too curious, might their steps delay, While to the regal dome they bent their way: But when unseen they pass'd the vulgar crowd, The same kind deity dissolv'd the cloud. Full in the court they stand with fix'd amaze, On the proud gates, strong walls and columns gaze, Which, rear'd in rows, erect their heads on high, And lift the brazen cornice to the sky. The portal past, young branching vines appear, And high in air their verdant honours rear: Beneath whose boughs, by matchless Vulcan made, Four copious fountains in four currents play'd; The first with milk, with wine the second glow'd, Ambrosial oil the third, the fourth with water flow'd; This, as by turns the Pleiads set or rose, Dissolv'd in summer, and in winter froze. Such were the wonders which the chiefs admire, All highly finished by the God of fire. With these were brass-hoof'd bulls, of curious frame, From brazen nostrils breathing living flame. And, near, a plough of burnish'd steel was laid, Which for the God of day great Vulcan made, When Phœbus brought him in his friendly car, Sore harrass'd in the fierce Phlegræan war. The midmost court they reach; on either side Large folding doors the various rooms divide. Two painted porticoes salute their eyes, And high in air transverse two turrets rise; In this, which far in stately height excels, Æeta with his royal consort dwells: Absyrtus that contains, his royal heir, Descended from Asterode the fair, A Scythian nymph, ere yet Æeta led Idya, Ocean's daughter, to his bed. Him Phaeton the youthful Colchians call, For he in beauty far surpass'd them all. The proud apartments that remain'd contain Chalciope, Medea and their train. Ordain'd a priestess to the Stygian queen, She at the palace now was seldom seen: But artful Juno, on this signal day, Within the regal court decreed her stay. Here now, from room to room, the pensive maid, To find Chalciope her sister, stray'd. Soon as she spied them in the spacious hall, Aloud she call'd, her sister heard her call, And with her maidens sallied from the door; Their growing webs were scatter'd on the floor. Well-pleas'd her sons she sees, and raptur'd stands, While high to heaven she rears her greeting hands; With equal joy to her embrace they fly. Then thus Chalciope with plaintive cry: ‘Here tho' you left me, heedless of my cries, ‘See! fate hath frown'd upon your bold emprise; ‘Hath check'd your voyage o'er the distant main, ‘And soon restor'd you to these arms again. ‘Wretch that I was, when by your sire's command, ‘Ye sought in evil hour the Grecian land! ‘Sad was the task your dying sire enjoin'd, ‘Sad and distressful to a mother's mind. ‘Ah! whence the wish Orchomenos to see, ‘His city visit, and abandon me? ‘Yes, Athamas's fancied wealth to gain, ‘Ye left me sorrowing, and ye sought the main.’ Rous'd by her cries, at length Æeta came, And to the hall repair'd his royal dame. With busy crowds the spacious hall is fill'd; The steer is chosen, and the victim kill'd. Some heat the baths, some cleave the knotty wood, And all attentive round their monarch stood. Cupid mean time, thro' liquid air serene, Speeds to the Colchian court his flight unseen; Like that large fly, which breese the shepherds call, That hastes to sting the heifers in the stall. The nimble God, unseen, the porch ascends, And there his bow behind a pillar bends; A fatal arrow from his quiver took, And quick advancing with insidious look, Behind great Æson's son, conceal'd from sight, He fits the arrow, fatal in its flight; Bends the tough bow with all his strength and art, And deep he hides it in Medea's heart. A sudden transport seiz'd the melting maid: The God, exulting now, no longer staid. The glowing shaft the virgin's heart inspires, And in her bosom kindles amorous fires. On Jason beam'd the splendor of her eyes; Her swoln breast heav'd with unremitting sighs: The frantic maid had all remembrance lost, And the soft pain her sickening soul engross'd. As some good housewise, who, to labour born, Fresh to her loom must rise with early morn; Studious to gain what human wants require, In embers heap'd preserves the seeds of fire; Renew'd by these the brand rekindling burns, And all the glowing heap to ashes turns: Thus, kindling slow, love's secret flames invade, And torture, as they rise, the troubled maid: Her changeful cheeks the heart-felt anguish show, Now pale they turn, now like the ruby glow. The rich repast by seneschals prepar'd, Fresh from their baths return'd, the strangers shar'd; And when the rage of hunger was suppress'd, His grandsons thus the Colchian king address'd: ‘Sons of my child, and Phrixus, honour'd most ‘Of all the guests that reach'd the Colchian coast, ‘Say, why so soon return'd? what loss constrains ‘This speedy visit to your native plains? ‘In vain, with terrors for your safety fraught, ‘I urg'd the distance of the climes ye sought; ‘Warn'd, since of old my sire's bright chariot bore ‘Me and fair Circe to Hesperia's shore, ‘Where now o'er Tuscan realms my sister reigns, ‘A long, long distance from the Colchian plains. ‘But what of this? come now, the cause declare ‘That brought you back, and who these heroes are.’ Then Argus, anxious for the Grecian band, By birthright eldest, rose and answer'd bland: “Our ship, O king, by nightly tempests tost, “On Mars's isle, a dreary coast, was lost; “We, on the wreck by furious surges driv'n, “Were sav'd at last by kind protecting heav'n. “Nor did those birds then desolate the shore, “Dire Harpies, that infested it before; “For these brave warriors, the preceding day, “Had driven the curst, infernal fiends away. “Sure to our prayer some God inclin'd his ear; “For when of Phrixus and your name they hear, “Food for our wants, and raiment they convey, “And to your city now they bend their way. “But would you know, I'll tell their purpos'd plan: “Lo! sprung from Æolus the godlike man, “Whom a fierce tyrant's stern decree constrains “To quit his country and his rich domains: “Nor can he scape Jove's rage, unless the fleece, “Base theft of Phrixus, be restor'd to Greece. “Their ship was fashion'd by Minerva's aid; “How different are the Colchian vessels made! “Ours, far the worst that ever rear'd a mast, “Split with the tempest's desolating blast; “Theirs, firm-compacted, and of fittest wood; “Defied each storm that heav'd the troubled flood: “With equal speed their nimble vessel sails, “Impell'd by oars alone, or favouring gales. “In this their chief, with chosen Greeks, explores “Unnumber'd seas, and towns, and wide-extended shores. “And now he sues the golden fleece to gain; “But that as best your princely will ordain— “Nor hostile comes he; as a friend he brings “Large gifts proportion'd to the state of kings. “Inform'd the fierce Sarmatians waste your lands, “He vows destruction to their barbarous bands. “Their names and lineage should you wish to hear, “Lend to my narrative a listening ear. “He, in whose cause the Grecian chiefs conspire, “Is valiant Jason, Æson is his sire, “The son of Cretheus: thus are we ally'd “By blood, relations on the father's side: “The sons of Æolus were Cretheus fam'd, “And Athemas, whose heir was Phrixus nam'd. “'Mid yon brave chiefs, Augeas you survey, “Illustrious offspring of the God of day, “And Telamon, who high his birth can prove, “His sire is Æacus, his grandsire Jove: “The rest, that visit your august abodes, “Are all the sons or grandsons of the Gods.” This said, the King with indignation swell'd, But chief enrag'd his grandsons he beheld; Thro' them he deem'd the Greeks to Colchos came: His eye-balls redden'd with avenging flame, While thus he spoke: ‘Hence from my sight away, ‘Nor longer, traitors, in my kingdom stay: ‘Back, back to Greece your speedy course pursue, ‘Nor idly hope the golden fleece to view. ‘Not for that fleece (vain pretext ye must own) ‘But for my sceptre came ye, and my crown. ‘Had ye not first my feast partook to-day, ‘Your tongues and hands, torn out and lopp'd away, ‘Should for your bold atrocious crimes atone: ‘My just revenge had spar'd your feet alone, ‘To bear you hastily to Greece again, ‘Dreading to visit more my just domain, ‘And with your perjuries the Gods profane.’ He said: bold Telamon with fury burn'd, And to the King stern answer had return'd, But Jason check'd his warmth, and mild reply'd: “Let not Æeta falsly thus decide. “Nor crowns, nor empires come we here to gain; “Who for such wealth would measure half the main? “But fate, and Pelias' more severe command, “Have forc'd the suppliant on your friendly land. “Aid us, and Greece your praises shall record, “And thank you, sovereign, with their conquering sword; “Whether the fierce Sarmatians to inthrall, “Or realms more barbarous for your vengeance call.” While Jason thus in gentlest terms reply'd, The tyrant's breast distracting thoughts divide, Whether with vengeance on the foe to fly, Or in the field of Mars his courage try. On this resolv'd, ‘What need (he thus begun) ‘With tedious tales my harrass'd ears to stun? ‘For whether from immortals ye descend, ‘Or match'd in might ye dare with me contend, ‘Soon will I prove; that proof must thou display; ‘Then, if victorious, bear the fleece away; ‘Nor shall my hand the golden prize withold: ‘Like your proud lord, I envy not the bold. ‘This nervous arm shall now sustain the fight, ‘Which calls to speedy proof thy boasted might. ‘Two bulls in Mars's field your wonder claim, ‘Their hoofs of brass, their nostrils breathing flame, ‘These oft I seize, and to the yoke constrain ‘To plough four acres of the stubborn plain. ‘No seeds I sow, but scatter o'er the land ‘A dragon's teeth; when, lo! an armed band ‘Of chiefs spring up: but soon as they appear, ‘I slay th' embattled squadrons with my spear. ‘Each morn I yoke the bulls, at eve resign: ‘Perform this labour, and the fleece is thine. ‘These are the terms; on these the prize I quit: ‘The weaker to the stronger must submit.’ He said; and Jason, sunk in thought profound, Sat mute, his eyes fast fix'd upon the ground; Long time he ponder'd o'er the vast design, Nor dar'd with confidence the battle join. So hard the task, he stood embarrass'd long, At last these words dropp'd cautious from his tongue: “Cruel thy terms, but just: my strength I'll try “In this dread conflict, though ordain'd to die. “For, say, what law so rigorous can there be, “As the hard law of fix'd necessity? “That law which forc'd me from my native home, “And bad me thus in search of dangers roam?” Perplex'd he spoke: then thus the king in rage, ‘Rejoin thy comrades, since thou dar'st engage. ‘But if the bulls constrain thy heart to yield, ‘Or the dread dangers of the martial field, ‘Be mine the toil; that hence the coward-slave ‘May dread to combat with the bold and brave.’ Imperious thus the haughty king replies: And from their seats incens'd the heroes rise. To warn his brothers here, at home, to wait, Argus stopp'd short awhile: then rush'd they thro' the gate. Far o'er the rest, in grace unmatch'd alone, And charms superior youthful Jason shone. Him thro' her veil the love-distracted maid With melting eyes, and glance oblique survey'd: Her mind, as in a dream, bewilder'd ran, And trac'd the footsteps of the godlike man. Sorrowing they went: to shun the monarch's ire, With fond Chalciope her sons retire; Medea follow'd, but with cares oppress'd; Such cares as love had rais'd within her breast. His graceful image in her mind she bore, His gait, his manner, and the robe he wore, His pointed words: thro' earth's remotest bound No prince she deem'd with such perfections crown'd. His tuneful voice still, still she seems to hear, Still the sweet accents charm her listening ear. The bulls and wrathful king excite her dread: She mourns his fate, as if already dead. From her bright eyes the shower of anguish breaks, And thus, o'erwhelm'd with woe, Medea speaks: “Why fall the tears of sorrow from my eyes, “Tho' he the first or last of heroes dies? “Perish the man!—no, safely let him sail; “And may my prayer, kind Hecate, prevail! “Safe sail he home: but, ah! if doom'd to bleed, “Teach him, that I rejoice not in the deed.” Thus mourn'd the maid: meantime to join their train, The chiefs pursue their course along the plain; Then Argus thus: ‘Though, Jason, you may blame, ‘And spurn the counsel which I now proclaim; ‘Yet sure for us, with threatening dangers press'd, ‘To try some safe expedient must be best. ‘A maid there is whose wondrous art excels, ‘Long taught by Hecate, in magic spells: ‘If she propitious to our wishes yield, ‘Thou com'st victorious from the martial field: ‘But if Chalciope decline her aid, ‘Be mine with tenderest motives to persuade. ‘Instant I'll go, on her for succour call; ‘For lo! one general ruin threatens all.’ Humane he spoke, and Jason thus rejoin'd; “Much I admire the purpose of thy mind. “Go, friend, to thy Chalciope repair, “Sue her with soft entreaty and with pray'r: “But, ah! vain hopes our vacant minds must fill, “Who trust for conquest to a woman's skill.” He said; and soon they join'd their social train, Rejoic'd to meet their princely peers again. Then Jason thus began his mournful tale: “With proud Æeta soft entreaties fail; “Our purpos'd end unable to attain, “Vain are my words, and your enquiries vain. “Two monstrous bulls the tyrant bids me tame; “Their hoofs of brass, their nostrils breathing flame; “These must my prowess to the yoke constrain, “To plough four acres of the stubborn plain; “My seed a dragon's teeth, to sow the land; “When lo! up springs a formidable band “Of bright-arm'd giants; soon as they appear, “Poiz'd by this arm, my well-directed spear “Must pierce the foe: intrepid I accede “To the hard terms, nor future dangers heed.” He said: they deem'd it all a desperate deed; Silent they stood, with sad dejected look Each gaz'd on other, till bold Peleus spoke: ‘Time calls for our resolves; our safety stands ‘No more in counsel, but in strength of hands. ‘If, Jason, eager of the honour, thou ‘Wilt yoke these fiery monsters to the plough, ‘Haste to the charge; but if thy soul relent, ‘Sunk in sad bodings of the dire event, ‘Nor dar'st thou go; then go not, nor look round, ‘If haply here some fitter man be found; ‘Myself will go, and risk my dearest breath; ‘No greater evil can befall than death.’ He spoke; and Telamon with rage inspir'd Starts up, and Idas with like fury fir'd; Next the twin-race of Tyndarus arise; Last Oeneus' son, who with the bravest vies; Tho' o'er his cheeks scarce spreads the callow down, His heart beats high for honour and renown. And while the rest in mute attention stand, Argus bespeaks the emulative band: “Tho' hard the task, O chiefs, I still portend “My parent will assist, and prove a friend. “Still in your ship awhile with patience wait; “For rashness will accelerate your fate. “Know, at Æeta's court a maiden dwells, “Deep skill'd by Hecate in magic spells: “All plants she knows that grow on mountains steep, “On vales, or meads, or in the boundless deep; “By these she quells the fire's relentless force, “Stops the mad torrent in its headlong course, “Retards the planets as they roll on high, “And draws the moon reluctant from the sky. “As from the palace o'er the plain we came “We mention'd oft my mother's honour'd name; “If she perchance her sister could persuade, “And fix our interest in the magic maid. “Back, if you bid, my ready steps I bend; “Fortune may smile, and fair success attend.” He said; when, lo! this signal of their love, Was kindly given them by the Powers above; For, by the falcon chas'd, a trembling dove, Far from his foe, to Jason's bosom flies; Stunn'd on the deck the felon falcon lies. Then Mopsus thus divin'd: ‘The Powers of heav'n, ‘They, they alone this gracious sign have giv'n. ‘Be then the maid in mildest terms address'd; ‘She'll listen friendly to our joint request, ‘I ween she will; if Phineus could foreknow ‘That we to Venus must our safety owe. ‘For, lo! her bird escapes: oh! may we prove ‘With safety crown'd, like her auspicious dove. ‘Entreat we now for Cytherea's aid, ‘And let th' advice of Argus be obey'd.’ Thus he; the chiefs approv'd, remembering well What Phineus deign'd prophetic to foretell: Idas alone with indignation burn'd, And with loud voice thus insolent return'd: ‘Gods! what a crew hath Argo wafted o'er! ‘Women, not heroes throng the hostile shore. ‘Women, who still to Venus' altars fly, ‘Nor dare but only on her aid rely. ‘No warlike deeds your dastard souls inflame: ‘To you is Mars an unregarded name. ‘As doves or falcons but direct your flight, ‘You flinch at danger, and you dread the fight. ‘Go; and all manly, martial toils forbear, ‘Sue to weak women, and deceive the fair.’ Furious he spoke; a general murmur ran Thro' the whole train; yet none oppos'd the man: Indignant then he sat. Of dauntless breast Thus Æson's son the listening train address'd: “This instant Argus to the town I send, “For thus the general suffrages intend: “Meanwhile approach we nearer to the land, “And fix, in sight, our halsers to the strand: “Ill suits us longer thus to lie conceal'd; “We neither shun, nor dread the fighting field.” He said, and Argus went without delay, And to the city backward sped his way; At Jason's call they ply the labouring oar, And land their beds and couches on the shore. Meantime the king a council call'd, and sat, (So were they wont) without the palace-gate. Assembled there, unceasing toils they plann'd, And wiles destructive to the Grecian band. Thus he ordain'd, that when the bulls had slain And stretch'd this dauntless hero on the plain, Himself would lay the lofty forest low, And for the funeral-pile prepare the bough: Their boasted ship should be consum'd with fire, And every traitor in the flames expire. No hospitable rites had Phrixus shar'd, Though much he wish'd and merited regard, Had not Jove hasten'd Hermes from above To win his favour and bespeak his love. Were these invaders of his native soil To thrive unpunish'd by rapacious spoil, Soon would they make his lowing herds a prey, And drive the shepherds and their flocks away. But Phrixus' sons, who join'd the lawless crew, He vow'd with double vengeance to pursue: Base plunderers! come to spoil him of his crown, So had the Sun, his sapient sire, foreshown: Who warn'd him to suspect his faithless race, And dread from them destruction and disgrace. Therefore dismiss'd he, by his sire's command, The youths far distant, ev'n to Grecian land. His daughters gave him no perplexing care, Nor young Absyrtus, his adopted heir; But from Chalciope's detested race He look'd for injuries, and fear'd disgrace. Thus stern denouncing, as with rage he swells, Death on each daring subject that rebels, His guards he charg'd, and threaten'd vengeance due, If either 'scap'd, the vessel or the crew. Swift to the palace Argus now repairs, And to his pitying mother pours his pray'rs, That she might importune Medea's aid; Nor had the queen her son's request delay'd, But boding fears her willing mind restrain, Lest all her fond entreaties should be vain; And should the project be disclos'd to view, Her father's ire the magic maid must rue. As on her couch reclin'd the virgin lay, Soft slumbers chas'd her anxious cares away; But frantic dreams, which love-sick minds infest, Present false terrors, and disturb her rest. Her hero seem'd the task to undertake, But not for honour, or the fleece's sake; For her alone he risk'd the glorious strife, To gain her love, and win her for his wife. She then in dreams her utmost succour lends, And with the bulls herself in fight contends. Her parents she, in fancied rage, aver'd False and regardless of their promis'd word, Who Jason doom'd the brazen bulls to foil, But made not her a partner of the toil. Then warm disputes and fierce contentions reign Between Æeta and the Grecian train: On her decision both the parties wait, And deem what she determines to be fate. In spite of parents, the fond maid express'd Her choice in favour of her godlike guest. Rage wrung their souls, and grief, and dire dismay, Till the loud clamour chas'd her sleep away. Trembling she starts; pale fears confus'd her look; Her soul reviv'd, and thus the virgin spoke: ‘Alas! what frightful dreams alarm my breast ‘For these fam'd chiefs, but most the royal guest? ‘I fear, some mighty mischief will ensue ‘From this bold leader and his gallant crew. ‘Yes, let him wed far off some Grecian dame; ‘Be mine my parents' house, my virgin's fame. ‘If from my headstrong purpose I refrain, ‘My sister's counsel might relieve my pain: ‘Oh! for her sons would she my aid implore, ‘My griefs would cease, my sorrows be no more!’ She said, and rose, nor longer deign'd to wait, But past the threshold of her sister's gate, Barefoot, undrest; long time she there remain'd, (For modest fears her passing step restrain'd;) Then back retreats; new courage soon acquires; Again advances, and again retires: Passions so various sway'd the virgin's breast, That when fierce love impell'd her, fear repress'd: Thrice she essay'd, and thrice retreating fled; Then on the pillow sunk her drooping head: As some young damsel, whom her friends had join'd In marriage to the darling of her mind, Conceal'd in secret, mourns her blooming mate Snatch'd from her arms by some untimely fate, Ere yet kind heaven indulg'd them to employ The golden moments in connubial joy: In silence she, tho' stung with torturing grief, Seeks on the widow'd bed the wish'd relief; Looks eager round, then sheds the trembling tear, Screen'd from the female eye, and tongue severe. Thus mourn'd Medea, not unseen; her pain Was mark'd by one, the youngest of her train; Who told Chalciope Medea's grief; And the sad tale exceeded her belief: Her sons consulting, she with them essay'd To sooth the sorrows of the love-sick maid. Instant she rose, and trembling with dismay Came to the chamber where her sister lay; Torn were her cheeks, the tears her grief confess'd; And thus Chalciope the maid address'd: ‘Say, why those tears that thus incessant fall? ‘What mighty ills your feeble mind appal? ‘Say, does some heaven-sent woe your grief inspire? ‘Or in your bosom dwells Æeta's ire, ‘My sons and I the cause? Oh! far from home, ‘On the world's utmost limits may I roam, ‘Nor see my parents, nor my native shore, ‘Nor hear the hated name of Colchos more!’ She said: Medea's cheeks the crimson stain'd; She strove to speak, but shame her words restrain'd. Now on her lips the ready accents hung, Now stifled in her breast: her faltering tongue Long time the purpose of her soul witheld, Artful at length she spoke, by love impell'd: “Dire fears, Chalciope, my soul dismay, “Lest with these guests my sire thy children slay, “My frightful dreams such horrid scenes present; “May some kind deity these woes prevent! “Lest for thy sons the tears eternal flow:” Thus spoke the maid, inquisitive in woe, If haply, for her children's fate afraid, Chalciope might first solicit aid. Mix'd grief and terror all the mother shook, At last, impassion'd, thus she trembling spoke: ‘'Tis for their sakes I now before thee stand; ‘Lend me, O lend thy salutary hand! ‘But swear by earth and heaven what I unfold ‘Rests in thy bosom, never to be told: ‘By the great Gods, and all that's dear I call, ‘Swear thou wilt never see my children fall, ‘Lest I too perish, and in fell despight ‘Rise a dread fury from the shades of night.’ Earnest she spoke, and tears incessant shed, Then on her sister's breast reclin'd her head, And mix'd their mutual sighs; groan answer'd groan, And the wide palace echo'd to their moan. Medea thus in mournful terms replies: “Alas! what succour can my thoughts devise, “Thus with thy cruel menaces oppress'd? “Oh, still uninjur'd may thine offspring rest! “By heaven above I swear, and earth below, “Earth, the great mother of the Gods, I vow, “(If aught my power can do, or words persuade) “To give thee counsel, and to lend my aid.” Thus spoke the maid; and thus Chalciope; ‘Perhaps, in favour of my sons and me, ‘Thy mind, to save the hero, might impart ‘Some secret counsel, some mysterious art. ‘From Jason Argus comes, imploring aid; ‘They rest their safety on the magic maid.’ Thus she; with joy exults the virgin's heart, And rising blushes rosy charms impart; But soon o'ercast with grief she thus reply'd: “To serve thee, sister, be no art untry'd. “Ne'er may I see with pleasurable eyes “In yon bright orient cheerful morning rise, “If aught on earth be half so dear to me “As is the welfare of thy sons and thee. “As brethren they my fond regard engage, “By blood related, and the same our age. “My sister, most esteem'd, and ever dear, “Thee with a daughter's love I still revere. “For with thy children, nurs'd by thee, I shar'd “(So fame reports) a mother's fond regard. “Go then, and from my prying parents hide “The means of succour which I now provide. “All-potent spells will I, at dawn of day, “To Hecate's mysterious shrine convey.” Pleas'd with the tale, Chalciope departs, And with the proffer'd aid transports her children's hearts. Fear mix'd with shame now seiz'd the lonely maid, Who dare, her sire reluctant, lend her aid. Now rising shades a solemn scene display O'er the wide earth, and o'er th' etherial way; All night the sailor marks the northern team, And golden circlet of Orion's beam: A deep repose the weary watchman shares, And the faint wanderer sleeps away his cares; Ev'n the fond maid, while yet all breathless lies Her child of love, in slumber seals her eyes: No sound of village-dog, no noise invades The death-like silence of the midnight shades; Alone Medea wakes: to love a prey, Restless she rolls, and groans the night away: For lovely Jason cares on cares succeed, Lest vanquish'd by the bulls her hero bleed; In sad review dire scenes of horrors rise, Quick beats her heart, from thought to thought she flies: As from the stream-stor'd vase with dubious ray The sun-beams dancing from the surface play; Now here, now there the trembling radiance falls, Alternate flashing round th' illumin'd walls: Thus fluttering bounds the trembling virgin's blood, And from her eyes descends a pearly flood. Now raving with resistless flames she glows, Now sick with love she melts with softer woes: The tyrant God, of every thought possess'd, Beats in each pulse, and stings and racks her breast: Now she resolves the magic to betray— To tame the bulls—now yield him up a prey. Again the drugs disdaining to supply, She loaths the light, and meditates to die: Anon, repelling with a brave disdain The coward thought, she nourishes the pain. Then pausing thus: “Ah wretched me! she cries, “Where'er I turn what varied sorrows rise! “Tost in a giddy whirl of strong desire, “I glow, I burn, yet bless the pleasing fire: “Oh! had this spirit from its prison fled, “By Dian sent to wander with the dead, “Ere the proud Grecians view'd the Colchian skies, “Ere Jason, lovely Jason, met these eyes! “Hell gave the shining mischief to our coast, “Medea saw him, and Medea's lost— “But why these sorrows? if the powers on high “His death decree,—die, wretched Jason, die! “Shall I elude my sire? my art betray? “Ah me! what words shall purge the guilt away! “But could I yield—O whither must I run “To find the chief—whom virtue bids me shun? “Shall I, all lost to shame, to Jason fly? “And yet I must—if Jason bleeds I die! “Honour farewell! adieu for ever shame! “Hail black disgrace! and branded be my fame! “Live, Jason, live! enjoy the vital air! “Live thro' my aid! and fly where winds can bear. “But when he flies, cords, poisons lend your pow'rs: “That day Medea treads th' infernal shores! “Yet what reproach will after death be cast? “The maids of Colchos will my honour blast— “I hear them cry—the false Medea's dead, “Thro' guilty passion for a stranger's bed; “Medea, careless of her virgin fame, “Preferr'd a stranger to a father's name! “O may I rather yield this vital breath, “Than bear that base dishonour worse than death!” Thus wail'd the fair, and seiz'd, with horrid joy, Drugs foes to life, and potent to destroy; A magazine of death! again she pours From her swoln eye-lids tears in shining show'rs. With grief insatiate, comfortless she stands, And opes the casket, but with trembling hands. A sudden fear her labouring soul invades, Struck with the horrors of th' infernal shades: She stands deep-musing with a faded brow, Absorb'd in thought, a monument of woe! While all the comforts that on life attend, The cheerful converse, and the faithful friend, By thought deep-imag'd in her bosom play, Endearing life, and charm despair away. Enlivening suns with sweeter light arise, And every object brightens to her eyes. Then from her hand the baneful drugs she throws, Consents to live, recover'd from her woes; Resolv'd the magic virtue to betray, She waits the dawn, and calls the lazy day: Time seems to stand, or backward drive his wheels; The hours she chides, and eyes the eastern hills: At length the morn displays her rosy light, And the whole town stands pictur'd to her sight. Back to the ship (his brothers left behind To mark the motions of Medea's mind) Argus return'd; meanwhile her golden hair, That flow'd diffusive in the wanton air, The virgin binds; then wipes the tears away, And from her eyes bids living lightning play; On every limb refreshing unguents pours, Unguents, that breathe of heaven, in copious show'rs. Her robe she next assumes; bright clasps of gold Close to the lessening waist the robe infold: Down from her swelling loins the rest unbound Floats in rich waves redundant o'er the ground: Then takes her veil, and stately treads the room With graceful ease, regardless of her doom. Thus forward moves the fairest of her kind, Blind to the future, to the present blind. Twelve maids, attendants on her virgin bow'r, Alike unconscious of the bridal hour, Join to the car her mules; dire rites to pay, To Hecate's fair fane she bends her way. A juice she bears, whose magic virtue tames (Thro' fell Persephone) the rage of flames; For one whole day it gives the hero might, To stand secure of harms in mortal fight; It mocks the sword; the sword without a wound Leaps as from marble shiver'd to the ground. This plant, which rough Caucasean mountains bore, Sprung from the venom of Prometheus' gore, (While on the wretch the savage eagle storm'd) In colour like Corycian crocus form'd: On two tall stems up-springs the flowery shoot, A cubit high; like red raw flesh its root. From this root's juice, as black as that distill'd From mountain beeches, the fair maid had fill'd A Caspian conch; but first, as best beseems, Array'd in black seven times in living streams She bath'd; and call'd seven times on Brimo's name At midnight hour, the ghost-compelling dame. She pluck'd the root, earth murmur'd from below, And sad Prometheus groan'd with agonizing woe. This root the Colchian maid selecting plac'd In the rich zone that bound her slender waist: Then issuing mounts the car, but not alone, On either side two lovely damsels shone: Her hand with skill th' embroider'd rein controuls, Back fly the streets as swift the chariot rolls. Along the wheel-worn road they speed their way, The domes retreat, the sinking towers decay: Bare to the knee succinct a damsel-train Close throng behind them, hastening to the plain. As when her limbs divine, Diana laves In fair Parthenius, or th' Amnesian waves, Sublime in royal state the bounding roes Whirl her bright car along the mountain brows: Swift to some sacred feast the goddess moves, The nymphs attend that haunt the shady groves; Th' Amnesian fount, or silver-streaming rills, Nymphs of the vales, or Oreads of the hills: The fawning beasts before the goddess play, Or, trembling, savage adoration pay: Thus on her car sublime the nymph appears, The croud falls back, and, as she moves, reveres: Swift to the fane aloft her course she bends, The fane she reaches, and on earth descends; Then to her train—“Ah me! I fear we stray, “Misled by folly to this lonely way! “Alas! should Jason with his Greeks appear, “Where should we fly? I fear, alas, I fear! “No more the Colchian youths, and virgin train, “Haunt the cool shade, or tread in dance the plain. “But since alone—with sports beguile your hours, “Collect sweet herbs, and pluck the fairest flow'rs: “If due attention to my words ye pay, “With richest spoils ye shall return to-day. “For Argus and Chalciope require, “(But sacred keep this secret from my sire) “That for large presents, for my succour paid, “To this rash stranger I should lend my aid. “I pass'd my word, and soon without his train “The Grecian will attend me at the fane: “In equal portions we the spoil will share— “For him a dose more fatal I prepare— “But when he comes, ye nymphs, retire apart.” She spoke; the nymphs approv'd the virgin's art. When Argus heard the maid with early day To Hecate's fair fane would speed her way, He beckon'd Jason from his bold compeers Apart, and Mopsus most renown'd of seers; For prescient Mopsus every omen knew Of birds that parting or approaching flew. No mortal ever of the first-born race Display'd like Jason such superior grace, Whether from demigods he trac'd his line, Or Jove himself immortal and divine, As grac'd by Juno, Jove's imperial queen, With soft address, and dignity of mien. His comrades gaz'd with wonder as he went; Mopsus foresaw and hail'd the blest event. Hard by the path, and near the temple, stands A poplar tall that wide its arms expands; Here frequent rooks their airy pastime take, And on the boughs their spray-form'd mansions make: One shook its pinions, (louder than the rest) And croaking, thus Saturnia's mind express'd: ‘Vain seer! whose divinations fail to tell ‘Those plain events which children know so well; ‘That maids will not, with comrades in the train, ‘Tell the soft love-tale to their favour'd swain. ‘False prophet, hence! for thee nor love inspires, ‘Nor Venus gratifies with soft desires.’ Then Mopsus laugh'd, as scoffing thus she spoke, To hear the bird her dark predictions croak; And thus: “Hence, Jason, to the fane, and find “The maiden to thy warmest wishes kind; “Venus approves, and fortune will ensue, “If what prophetic Phineus said prove true. “Myself and Argus here will wait apart, “Go and unfold the secrets of thy heart; “Be every mode of soft persuasion try'd.” He counsel'd wisely, and the chief comply'd. Meanwhile the maid her secret thoughts enjoy'd, And one dear object all her soul employ'd: Her train's gay sports no pleasure can restore, Vain was the dance, and music charm'd no more; She hates each object, every face offends, In every wish her soul to Jason sends; With sharpen'd eyes the distant lawn explores, To find the hero whom her soul adores; At every whisper of the passing air, She starts, she turns, and hopes her Jason there; Again she fondly looks, nor looks in vain, He comes, her Jason shines along the plain. As when, emerging from the watery way, Refulgent Sirius lifts his golden ray, He shines terrific! for his burning breath Taints the red air with fevers, plagues and death; Such to the nymph approaching Jason shows, Bright author of unutterable woes; Before her eyes a swimming darkness spread, Her flush'd cheeks glow'd, her very heart was dead: No more her knees their wonted office knew, Fix'd, without motion, as to earth they grew. Her train recedes—the meeting lovers gaze In silent wonder, and in still amaze. As two fair cedars on the mountain's brow, Pride of the groves! with roots adjoining grow; Erect and motionless the stately trees Short time remain, while sleeps each fanning breeze, Till from th' Æolian caves a blast unbound Bends their proud tops, and bids their boughs resound: Thus gazing they; till by the breath of love, Strongly at last inspir'd, they speak, they move; With smiles the love-sick virgin he survey'd, And fondly thus address'd the blooming maid: ‘Dismiss, my fair, my love, thy virgin fear; ‘Tis Jason speaks, no enemy is here! ‘Dread not in me a haughty heart to find, ‘In Greece I bore no proud inhuman mind. ‘Whom would'st thou fly? stay, lovely virgin, stay! ‘Speak every thought! far hence be fears away! ‘Speak! and be truth in every accent found! ‘Scorn to deceive! we tread on hallow'd ground. ‘By the stern power who guards this sacred place, ‘By the fam'd authors of thy royal race; ‘By Jove, to whom the stranger's cause belongs, ‘To whom the suppliant, and who feels their wrongs; ‘O guard me, save me, in the needful hour! ‘Without thy aid thy Jason is no more. ‘To thee a suppliant, in distress I bend, ‘To thee a stranger, one who wants a friend! ‘Then, when between us seas and mountains rise, ‘Medea's name shall sound in distant skies; ‘All Greece to thee shall owe her heroes' fates, ‘And bless Medea thro' her hundred states. ‘The mother and the wife, who now in vain ‘Roll their sad eyes fast-streaming o'er the main, ‘Shall stay their tears: the mother, and the wife, ‘Shall bless thee for a son's or husband's life! ‘Fair Ariadne, sprung from Minos' bed, ‘Sav'd valiant Theseus, and with Theseus fled, ‘Forsook her father, and her native plain, ‘And stem'd the tumults of the surging main; ‘Yet the stern sire relented, and forgave ‘The maid, whose only crime it was to save; ‘Ev'n the just Gods forgave: and now on high ‘A star she shines, and beautifies the sky: ‘What blessings then shall righteous heaven decree ‘For all our heroes sav'd, and sav'd by thee? ‘Heaven gave thee not to kill, so soft an air; ‘And cruelty sure never look'd so fair!’ He ceas'd, but left so charming on her ear His voice, that listening still she seem'd to hear; Her eyes to earth she bends with modest grace, And heaven in smiles is open'd on her face. A look she steals; but rosy blushes spread O'er her fair cheek, and then she hangs her head. A thousand words at once to speak she tries; In vain—but speaks a thousand with her eyes; Trembling the shining casket she expands, Then gives the magic virtue to his hands; And had the power been granted to convey Her heart—had given her very heart away. For Jason beam'd in beauty's charms so bright, The maid admiring languish'd with delight. Thus, when the rising sun appears in view, On the fair rose dissolves the radiant dew. Now on the ground both cast their bashful eyes, Both view each other now with wild surprize. The rosy smiles now dimpling on their cheeks, The fair at length in faltering accents speaks: “Observant thou to my advice attend, “And hear what succour I propose to lend. “Soon as my sire Æeta shall bestow “The dragon's teeth in Mars's field to sow, “The following night in equal shares divide; “Bathe well thy limbs in some perennial tide; “Then all retir'd, thyself in black array, “Dig the round foss, and there a victim slay, “A female lamb; the carcase place entire “Above the foss, then light the sacred pyre, “And Perseus' daughter, Hecate, appease “With honey, sweetest labour of the bees; “This done, retreat, nor, while the relicks burn, “Let howling dogs provoke thee to return, “Nor human footsteps; lest thou render vain “The charm, and with dishonour join thy train. “Next morn, the whole enchantment to fulfil, “This magic unguent on thy limbs distil: “Then thou with ease wilt strong, and graceful move, “Not like a mortal, but the Gods above. “Forget not with this unguent to besmear “Thy sword, thy buckler, and tremendous spear: “No giant's falchions then can harm thy frame, “Nor the fell rage of bulls expiring flame. “One day, nor longer, wilt thou keep the field; “Nor thou to perils, nor to labour yield. “But mark my words; when thou, with ceaseless toil, “Hast yok'd the bulls and plough'd the stubborn soil; “And seest up-springing on the teeth-sown land “Of giant foes a formidable band, “Hurl slily 'midst their ranks a rough hard stone, “And they, like dogs contending for a bone, “Will slay each other: thou with speed renew “The glowing fight, and conquest will ensue. “Thus shalt thou bear from Æa's realms to Greece, “If such thy fix'd resolve, the Golden Fleece.” This said, her eyes were fix'd upon the ground, And her fair cheeks with streaming sorrows drown'd; Desponding anguish seiz'd her gentle mind, Lest he should leave her comfortless behind. Imbolden'd thus, him by the hand she press'd, And in the language of her soul address'd; “If safely hence thou sail'st, O, think of me! “As I for ever shall remember thee! “And freely tell me, to relieve my pain, “Where lies thy home beyond the boundless main? “Say, is Orchomenos thy native soil? “Or dwell'st thou nearer on th' Ææan isle? “Let me that far-fam'd virgin's name inquire, “Who boasts the same high lineage with my sire.” She said; her tears his soft compassion won, And thus the chief, by Love inspir'd, begun: ‘While on my fancy bright ideas play, ‘Thy image never from my soul shall stray, ‘If safe I sail, preserv'd by thee, to Greece, ‘Nor heavier labours interrupt my peace. ‘But if the distant country where I dwell ‘Thy will demands, my ready tongue shall tell. ‘A land there is which lofty hills surround, ‘For fertile pastures and rich herds renown'd, ‘Where from Prometheus good Deucalion came, ‘His royal heir, Hæmonia is the name. ‘Deucalion here the first foundations laid ‘Of towns, built fanes, and men by empire sway'd; ‘There my Iolcos stands, and many more ‘Fair ample cities, that adorn the shore. ‘What time, as rumour'd by the voice of fame, ‘Æolian Minyas to that country came, ‘He built, close bordering on the Theban ground, ‘Orchomenos, a city far renown'd. ‘But why your wonder should I vainly raise? ‘My birth-place tell, and Ariadne's praise? ‘For this the virgin's name you now inquire, ‘A lovely maid, and Minos is her sire. ‘Oh! may, like hers, your sire propitious prove, ‘Who honour'd Theseus with his daughter's love!’ Complacent thus he sooth'd her sorrowing soul; Yet anxious cares within her bosom roll. “Perchance in Greece” (the pensive maid rejoin'd) “Oaths are rever'd, and solemn compacts bind. “But Minos greatly differs from my sire, “Nor I to Ariadne's charms aspire. “Then mention hospitality no more; “But, safe conducted to thy native shore, “Grant this, 'tis all I ask, Oh! think of me, “As I for ever shall remember thee, “In my great sire, the Colchian king's despite: “But if thy pride my ardent passion slight, “Fame, or some bird the hateful news will bring; “Then will I chace thee on the tempest's wing, “Brand thy false heart, thy curs'd familiar be, “And prove thou ow'st thy life, thy all to me.” Medea thus, and tears abundant shed; And mildly thus the son of Æson said: ‘In vain, dear nymph, thy missive bird shall soar ‘Thro' air sublime, in vain the tempest roar. ‘But if towards Greece thou deign'st thy course to bear, ‘Immortal honours shall attend thee there; ‘There husbands, brothers, sons, so long deplor'd, ‘Safe to their native land by thee restor'd, ‘Shall as a Goddess reverence thy name, ‘And pay thee rites which only Gods can claim. ‘But would'st thou grace my bed with bridal state, ‘Our love can only be dissolv'd by fate.’ His words with raptures all her soul subdue; Yet gloomy objects rise before her view, Ordain'd, ere long, Thessalia's realms to see; For such was Juno's absolute decree, That soon to Greece the Colchian maid should go, To Pelias source of unremitting woe. Meanwhile apart her anxious handmaids stay, In silence waiting till the close of day: Such pleasing transports in her bosom roll, His form, his words so captivate her soul, On feather'd feet the hours unheeded fled, Which warn'd her home: ‘Hence (cautious Jason said) ‘Hence let us hasten unperceiv'd away, ‘And here enraptur'd pass some future day.’ Thus the blest hours in converse sweet they spent, And both unwilling from the temple went; He to his comrades bordering on the main, The fair Medea to her virgin train. Her train approach'd, but stood unnotic'd by; Her soul sublime expatiates in the sky. Her rapid car she mounts; this hand sustains The polish'd thong, and that the flowing reins. Fleet o'er the plain the nimble mules convey'd To Æa's walls the love-transported maid. Meanwhile Chalciope astonish'd stands, And instant tidings of her sons demands; In vain: sad cares had clos'd Medea's ears, No answers gives she, and no questions hears; But on a footstool low, beside her bed, All bath'd in tears she sits; her hand sustains her head. There sits she pondering, in a pensive state, What dire distresses on her counsels wait. But Jason, eager to return, withdrew With his two friends, and join'd his social crew, Who throng'd impatient round, while he display'd The secret counsels of the Colchian maid, And show'd the potent herbs: Idas apart Conceal'd the choler rankling in his heart. Meanwhile the rest, when glimmering day-light clos'd, Wrapp'd in the mantle of the night repos'd. Next morn they sent Æthalides the son Of Mercury, and valiant Telamon, (For thus in council had the Greeks decreed) Of fierce Æeta to demand the seed, The serpent's teeth, whose ever-wakeful sight Watch'd o'er the fountain of the God of fight. This baneful monster was by Cadmus slain, Seeking Europa o'er the Theban plain; An heifer to his seat of regal sway, So will'd prophetic Phœbus, led the way. These teeth Minerva from the monster rent, And part to Cadmus and Æeta sent: Sow'd on Bœotia's ample plains, from those A hardy race of earth-born giants rose. To Jason these he gave, a precious spoil; Nor, tho' his matchless arm the bulls might foil, Deem'd he, that victory would crown his toil. The sun now sinking with a feeble ray To distant Ethiopians slop'd his way; Night yok'd her steeds: the Grecian heroes spread Around the halsers and the sails their bed. The northern Bear was sunk beneath the hills, And all the air a solemn silence fills: Jason to lonely haunts pursu'd his way; (All rites adjusted the preceding day.) 'Twas Argus' care a lambkin to provide, And milk, the rest the ready ship supply'd. A sweet sequester'd spot the hero found, Where silence reigns, and welling streams abound; And here, observant of due rites, he laves, His limbs immerging in the cleansing waves; Then o'er his shoulders, pledge of favours past, The gift of fair Hypsipyla he cast, A sable robe: a deep round foss he made, And on the kindling wood the victim laid: The mix'd libation pouring o'er the flame, Loud he invok'd infernal Brimo's name; Then back retires: his call her ears invades, And up she rises from the land of shades: Snakes, wreath'd in oaken boughs, curl'd round her hair, And gleaming torches cast a dismal glare. To guard their queen the hideous dogs of hell Rend the dark welkin with incessant yell; The heaving ground beneath her footsteps shakes; Loud shriek the Naiads of the neighbouring lakes, And all the fountain-nymphs astonish'd stood Where Amaranthine Phasis rolls his flood. Fear seiz'd the chief, yet backward he withdrew, Nor, till he join'd his comrades, turn'd his view. And now on Caucasus, with snow o'erspread, The rising morn her silver radiance shed, When proud Æeta, earlier than the rest, The fencing corslet buckled to his breast, The spoils of Mimas of gigantic race, Whom Mars had vanquish'd on the plains of Thrace: His golden helmet to his head he bound, With four fair crests of glittering plumage crown'd, Bright as the sun new rising from the main; His nervous arms a mighty spear sustain: From his broad shoulder beams his sevenfold shield, Which not a chief of all the Greeks could wield, Since great Alcides, of his friend bereft, Was (sad mischance!) on Mysia's borders left. His son hard by with ready chariot stands; The king ascends; the reins adorn his hands; Fierce to the field he hastes in regal state, And crouds of Colchians round their monarch wait. As ocean's god, when drawn by rapid steeds, To Isthmian games, or Calaureia speeds, To Tænarus, or rocky Petra roves, Or where Geræstus boasts her oaken groves, Onchestus' woods, or Lerna's limpid spring; So to the combat drives the Colchian king. Meanwhile, instructed by the magic maid, The chief his shield, his spear and trenchant blade With unguents smear'd: the Greeks approaching nigh In vain their efforts on his armour try; But chief the spear such magic charms attend, No force can break it, and no onset bend. Idas enrag'd deals many a furious wound, But, as hard hammers from an anvil bound, So from the spear his sword recoiling sprung: The distant vales with loud applauses rung. Next, with the potent charm the chief anoints His well-turn'd limbs, and supples all his joints. And, lo! new powers invigorate his hands, And arm'd with strength intrepidly he stands. As the proud steed, exulting in his might, Erects his ears, impatient for the fight, And pawing snuffs the battle from afar; So pants the hero for the promis'd war. Firmly he moves, incapable of fear; One hand his shield sustains, and one the spear. Thus, when black clouds obscure the darkening day, And rains descend, the living lightnings play. And now the fight draws near; the Grecian train Sail up the Phasis to the martial plain; From which as far the towers of Æa stand, As when the chieftains, who the games command For some dead king, the bounding barriers place For steeds or men contending in the race. Æeta there they found, of mind elate; On Phasis' banks his chariot rolls in state. On the Caucasian summits, that command The field of Mars, the crowded Colchians stand. Now Argo moor'd, the prince invades the field, Arm'd with his magic spear, and ample shield; With serpents' teeth his brazen helm was stor'd, And cross his shoulder gleam'd his glittering sword: Like Mars the chief enormous power display'd, Or Phœbus brandishing his golden blade. O'er the rough tilth he cast his eyes around, And soon the plough of adamant he found, And yokes of brass: his helm (approaching near) He plac'd on earth, and upright fix'd his spear. To find the bulls he farther went afield, And trac'd their steps, arm'd only with his shield. In a dark cave which smoky mists surround, Horrid and huge their safe retreat he found. With rage impetuous forth the monsters came, And from their nostrils issued streams of flame. Fear seiz'd the Greeks, but he their fury braves; Firm as a rock, defies the roaring waves; Screen'd by his shield, intrepidly he scorns The bulls loud-bellowing, and their butting horns; Collected firm he wards each threatening blow. As at the forge where melting metals glow, While now the bellows heave, now sink by turns, The flame subsides, or with fresh fury burns; Stirr'd to the bottom roars the raging fire: So roar the bulls, and living flame respire, That fierce as lightning round the hero play'd, In vain, now shelter'd by the magic maid. One bull he seiz'd, that aim'd a deadly stroke, Seiz'd by his horns, and dragg'd him to the yoke; Then hurl'd the roaring monster on the ground; An equal fate his fellow-captive found. Loos'd from his arm he flung his shield aside, And the two monsters manfully he ply'd, Dragg'd on their knees his fiery foes o'ercame, And shifting artfully escap'd the flame. Æeta view'd him with astonish'd eyes; When lo! the sons of Tyndarus arise, As erst it was decreed, and from the land Heav'd the strong yokes and gave them to his hand: These o'er the bulls' low-bended necks he flung; The brazen beam by rings suspended hung. The youths retreating from the burning field, The chief resum'd his loaded helm, his shield Behind him thrown; then grasp'd his massy spear, (Thus arm'd the hinds of Thessaly appear, With long sharp goads to prick their bullocks' sides) And the firm plough of adamant he guides. The restiff bulls with indignation fir'd, From their broad nostrils living flames expir'd, Loud as the blasts when wintry winds prevail, And trembling sailors furl the folding sail. Urg'd by his spear the bulls their task fulfil, Prove their own prowess, and the ploughman's skill. As the sharp coulter cleft the clodded ground, The roughen'd ridges sent a rattling sound. Firm oe'r the field undaunted Jason treads, And scattering wide the serpent's teeth he spreads; Yet oft looks back, suspecting he should find A legion rising up in arms behind: Unwearied still the bulls their toil pursue; Their brazen hoofs the stubborn soil subdue. When now three portions of the day were spent, And weary hinds at evening homeward went, The chief had till'd four acres of the soil; He then releas'd the monsters from their toil. Away they scamper'd wildly o'er the plain; Himself rejoin'd his delegated train, Till on the field his earth-born foes appear: The Greeks their animated hero cheer. He in his helm, replenish'd at the springs, To slake his burning thirst fresh water brings. His limbs renew'd with forceful vigour play, His heart beats boldly and demands the fray. Thus the fell boar disdains the hunter-bands, Foams, whets his tusks, and in defiance stands. Now rose th' embattled squadron in the field, In glittering helms array'd, with spear and shield, Bright o'er the Martial plain the splendors rise, And dart in streams of radiance to the skies. Thus, when thick snow the face of nature shrouds, And nightly winds dispel the wintry clouds, The stars again their splendid beams display; So shone the warriours in the face of day. But Jason, mindful of the maid's command, Seiz'd a vast rock, and rais'd it from the land: Not four stout youths, for strength of limbs renown'd, Could lift a weight so ponderous from the ground: This 'midst his foes, embattled on the field, He hurl'd, and safe retir'd behind his shield. The Colchians shout, as when the raging main Roars round tremendous rocks, but roars in vain. In silence fix'd, Æeta stands aghast To see the fragment with such fury cast. The host, like dogs contending o'er their prey, With curs'd ferocity their comrades slay, Then leave on earth their mangled trunks behind, Like pines or oaks uprooted by the wind. As shoots a star from heaven's etherial brow, Portending vengeance to the world below, Who thro' dark clouds descry its radiant light: Thus Jason rush'd, in glittering armour bright. His brandish'd falchion fell'd the rising foes: Succinct in arms, some half their lengths disclose, Some scarce their shoulders; other feebly stand, While others, treading firm, the fight demand. As on the bounds which separate hostile states, Eternal source of battle and debates, The cautious hind the cruel spoiler fears, And reaps his wheat with yet unripen'd ears; Ere yet the spikes their wonted growth attain, Ere yet the sun-beams have matur'd the grain: So Jason's arms the rising squadrons mow'd; Their blood profusely in the furrows flow'd. Some sidelong fall on earth, and some supine, Some prone lie groveling and their lives resign, Like whales incumbent on the buoyant main: Some wounded perish ere they tread the plain; As late in air they held their heads on high, So lowly humbled in the dust they lie. Thus tender plants, by copious torrents drown'd, Strew their fresh leaves, uprooted from the ground; The tiller views with heart-corroding pain His fostering care, and all his labours vain. Æeta thus with wild vexation burn'd, And with his Colchians to the town return'd, Some weightier task revolving in his mind: Thus clos'd the combat, and the day declin'd. END OF THE THIRD BOOK. BOOK IV. THE ARGUMENT. Jason obtains the Golden Fleece by the assistance of Medea. She embarks with the Argonauts for Greece. Æeta pursues them. Having crossed the Euxine sea, they sail up the Ister; and by an arm of that river enter the Adriatic. Absyrtus is treacherously murdered by Jason. They sail into the Sardinian sea by the way of the Eridanus and the Rhone. The murder of Absyrtus is expiated by Circe, at whose island they land. Thetis and her nymphs conduct the heroes through the straits of Scylla and Charybdis. They sail by the island infested with the Syrens, from whose enchantments Orpheus delivers them. At Corcyra, once called Drepane, they meet with the Colchians that pursued them through the Symplegades; who request Alcinous, king of the island, to deliver up Medea. He agrees to send her back to her father, if unmarried; but if married to Jason, he refuses to separate them. Upon this determination her nuptials are immediately celebrated. They again put to sea, and are driven upon the quicksands of Africa. The tutelary Deities of the country extricate them from their distresses. They bear Argo on their shoulders as far as the lake Tritonis. The Hesperides, who were bewailing the death of the serpent, slain the preceding day by Hercules, give some account of that hero. The death of Canthus and Mopsus, two of their comrades, is related. Triton, whose figure is particularly described, gives them directions about their voyage. They sail near Crete. The story of Talus. At Hippuris they sacrifice to Phœbus, who, standing on the top of an hill, enlightens their way. The clod of earth, given by Triton to Euphemus, becomes an island, called Calliste. They anchor at Ægina; and loosing from thence, arrive without further interruption at Thessaly. O Goddess, daughter of th' eternal king, Medea's various cares and counsels sing: Far from my mind the sad suspense remove, Whether to celebrate her lawless love, Or whether her base flight from Colchis' bay, Best claims the tribute of my tuneful lay. In solemn council to his faithful chiefs The vengeful king disclos'd his bosom-griefs: Sore disconcerted at the recent fight, He spent in long debate the doleful night; Mistrusting still, these schemes, so deeply laid, Were all conducted by his daughters' aid. Meanwhile th' imperial queen of heaven had shed O'er the fair virgin's breast despondent dread. She starts, she trembles, as, pursu'd by hounds, The fawn light skipping o'er the meadow bounds. She fears the secrets of her soul betray'd, And her sire's vengeance for her proffer'd aid. Her handmaids, conscious of her crimes, she fears; Her eyes fierce flames emit, loud murmurs fill her ears. Her death she meditates in wild despair, And, sadly sighing, tears her golden hair. Now fate imbibing from the poison'd bowl, Soon had she freed her voluntary soul, And Juno's projects all been render'd vain, But, kindly pitying a lover's pain, The Goddess urg'd with Phrixus' sons her flight, And eas'd her bosom of its sorrow's weight. Forth from her casket every drug she pours, And to her lap consigns the magic stores. Then with a parting kiss her bed she press'd, Clung round each door, and ev'n the walls caress'd. A lock she tore of loosely-flowing hair, And safe consign'd it to her mother's care, The sacred relick of her virgin-fame; And, wailing thus, invok'd Idya's name: ‘This lock, O mother, at my hand receive, ‘Which I, far-distant roaming, with thee leave. ‘Farewell, Chalciope; far hence I roam! ‘And thou farewell, my first, my dearest home! ‘Oh! hadst thou, stranger, in deep ocean drown'd, ‘Perish'd, and never trod on Colchian ground!’ She spoke, and tears her heart-felt woe betray'd; Then fled she instant. Thus the captive maid, When, from her friends and country banish'd far, She shares the miserable fate of war, Disus'd to toil beneath a tyrant's sway, Flies from oppression's rod with speed away. With speed like her's the weeping fair withdrew: The doors spontaneous open'd as she flew, Shook by her magic song; barefoot she strays Thro' winding paths and unfrequented ways. Before her face one hand her vesture holds, And one confines its border's flowing folds. Beyond the city-walls with trembling haste, Unseen of all the centinels, she pass'd, Then by accustom'd paths explor'd the fane, Where spectres rise, and plants diffuse their bane; (Thus practise magic maids their mystic art) Fears ill portending flutter round her heart. Her frenzy Cynthia, rising bright, survey'd, And this soliloquy in triumph made: ‘Yes, with Endymion's heavenly charms o'ercome, ‘I to the cave at Latmos once could roam, ‘Of love regardful, when your potent lay ‘Had from the starry spheres seduc'd my ray, ‘That you, protected by the gloom of night, ‘Might celebrate unseen the mystic rite, ‘Your lov'd employ: now Cupid's shafts subdue, ‘Not Cynthia only, but, fair sorceress, you. ‘For you his toils the wily god hath wove, ‘And all your heart inflam'd with Jason's love. ‘Come then, those pangs which love ordains endure, ‘And bear with courage what you cannot cure.’ She said: impetuous hastening to the flood, Soon on its lofty banks Medea stood. A fire, which midnight's deadly gloom dispell'd, Signal of conquest gain'd, she here beheld. Involv'd in shade, the solitary dame Rais'd her shrill voice, and call'd on Phrontis' name. Known was her voice to Phrixus' sons, who bear The grateful tidings to their leader's ear. The truth discover'd, the confederate host All silent stood, in wild amazement lost. Loud call'd she thrice; and with responsive cries, His friends requesting, Phrontis thrice replies. Quick at her call they ply the bending oar; Nor were their halsers fasten'd to the shore, When Æson's son at one decisive bound Leaps from the lofty deck upon the ground; Phrontis and Argus hasten to her aid, Whose knees embracing, thus Medea pray'd: ‘Oh! save me, friends, from my offended sire, ‘Oh! save yourselves from dread Æeta's ire. ‘Known are our projects: sail we hence afar, ‘Ere Æa's monarch mounts his rapid car. ‘My magic charms shall close the dragon's eyes, ‘And soon reward you with the golden prize. ‘But thou, lov'd guest, continue faithful still, ‘And swear whate'er thou promis'dst to fulfil: ‘Ah! leave me not to infamy a scorn, ‘By all my friends abandon'd and forlorn.’ Plaintive she spoke: his arms around her waist Rapturous he threw, then rais'd her and embrac'd, And solac'd thus in terms of tenderest love: “By heaven's high king I swear, Olympian Jove, “By Juno, goddess of the nuptial rite, “Soon as my native land transports my sight, “Thou, lovely virgin, shalt be duly led, “Adorn'd with honours, to my bridal bed.” This said, in her's he clos'd his plighted hand: To Mars's grove Medea gave command, Spite of her sire, the vessel to convey, And bear by night the golden fleece away. Swift at the word they sprung; the Colchian maid Embark'd, and instant was their anchor weigh'd. Their crashing oars resound: she oft to land Reverts her eye, and waves her trembling hand: But Æson's son his ready aid affords, And sooths her sorrows with consoling words. Wak'd by their hounds, what time the huntsmen rise, And shake the balm of slumber from their eyes, At twilight, ere Aurora's dreaded ray Efface the tracks, and waft the scent away: Jason, then landing with the fair, attains, With flowers diversified, the verdant plains, Where first the ram, with Phrixus' weight oppress'd, His wearied knee inclin'd, and sunk to rest. Hard by, an altar's stately structure stands, To favouring Jove first rais'd by Phrixus' hands, Where he the golden monster doom'd to bleed; So his conductor Hermes had decreed. Here, as by Argus taught, the chiefs withdrew, While their lone course the regal pair pursue Thro' the thick grove, impatient to behold The spreading beech that bears the fleecy gold. Suspended here, it darts a beamy blaze, Like a cloud tipp'd with Phœbus' orient rays. With high-arch'd neck, in front the dragon lies, And towards the strangers turns his sleepless eyes; Aloud he hisses: the wide woods around, And Phasis' banks return the doleful sound. Colchians, far distant from Titanus' shore, Heard ev'n to Lycus' streams the hideous roar; Lycus, who, sever'd from Araxis' tides, A boisterous flood, with gentle Phasis glides: One common course their streams united keep, And roll united to the Caspian deep. The mother, starting from her bed of rest, Fears for her babe reclining on her breast, And closely clasping to her fondling arms, Protects her trembling infant from alarms. As from some wood, involv'd in raging fires, Clouds following clouds ascend in curling spires: The smoky wreaths in long succession climb, And from the bottom rise in air sublime; The dragon thus his scaly volumes roll'd, Wreath'd his huge length, and gather'd fold in fold. Him, winding slow, beheld the magic dame, And Sleep invok'd the monster's rage to tame. With potent song the drowsy God she sway'd To summon all his succour to her aid; And Hecate from Pluto's coasts she drew, To lull the dauntless monster, and subdue. Jason advanc'd with awe, with awe beheld The dreaded dragon by her magic quell'd. Lifeless he lay, each languid fold unbound, And his vast spine extended on the ground. Thus, when the boisterous wave forbears to roar, It sinks recumbent on the peaceful shore. Still strove the monster his huge head to heave, And in his deadly jaws his foe receive. A branch of juniper the maid applies, Steep'd in a baneful potion, to his eyes: Its odours strong the branch diffus'd around, And sunk th' enormous beast in sleep profound. Supine he sunk; his jaws forgot to move, And his unnumber'd folds are spread o'er half the grove. Then Jason to the beech his hand applies, And grasps, at her command, the golden prize. Still she persists to ply the potent spell, And the last vigour of the monster quell, Till he advis'd her to rejoin the crew; Then from the grove of Mars the maid withdrew. As some fair dame, when Cynthia rises bright, Beholds the beamy splendors with delight, Which from her vestment strong-reflected rise; Thus gloried Jason in the glistering prize. The flaming rays, that from its surface flow'd, Beam'd on his cheeks, and on his forehead glow'd. Large as the heifer's hide, or as the hind's, Which in Achaia's plains the hunter finds, Shone the thick, ponderous fleece, whose golden rays Far o'er the land diffus'd a beamy blaze. He on his shoulders, now, the spoil suspends, Low at his feet the flowing train descends; Collecting, now, within its ponderous folds, His grasping hand the costly capture holds. Fearful he moves, with circumspect survey, Lest men or gods should snatch the prize away. Now as returning morn illumes the land, The royal pair rejoin the gallant band. The gallant band beheld with wondering eyes, Fierce as Jove's fiery bolt, the radiant prize. Their hands extending as they flock around, All wish to heave the trophy from the ground. But Jason interdicting singly threw O'er the broad fleece a covering rich and new; Then in the ship he plac'd the virgin-guest, And thus the listening demigods address'd: ‘No longer doubt ye, comrades, to regain ‘Far o'er a length of seas your lov'd domain. ‘For see, the end of all our glorious toil, ‘Won by Medea's aid, this precious spoil! ‘Her, not reluctant, I to Greece will bear, ‘And with connubial honours crown her there. ‘Guard your fair patroness, ye gallant crew, ‘Who sav'd your country when she succour'd you. ‘Soon will Æeta with his Colchian train ‘Preclude, I ween, our passage to the main. ‘Some with your oars resume your destin'd seat; ‘Some with your shields secure your wish'd retreat; ‘This rampire forming, we their darts defy, ‘Nor, home returning, unreveng'd will die. ‘Lo! on our prowess all we love depends, ‘Our children, parents, country and our friends. ‘Greece, as we speed, thro' future times shall boast ‘Her empire fix'd, or wail her glory lost.’ He said, and arm'd; the heroes shout applause: Then from its pendent sheath his sword he draws, Severs the halser, and, in arms array'd, His station fixes near the magic maid, And where Ancæus' hand the pilot's art display'd. Keen emulation fir'd the labouring crew, As down the stream of Phasis Argo flew. Medea's flight now reach'd Æeta's ear, And all her crimes in all their guilt appear. To council call'd, in arms the Colchian train Rush thick as billows on the roaring main, Thick as the leaves that flutter from above, When blasting autumn strips the faded grove; So thick the shouting Colchians rush to war, Led by Æeta in his splendid car, Glorying in Phœbus' gifts, his rapid steeds, Whose swiftness far the speed of winds exceeds. His left a buckler's wide circumference rais'd; In his extended right a flambeau blaz'd; His girded belt a mighty spear sustains; His son Absyrtus grasps the flowing reins. Now by tough oars impell'd and prosperous tides, The vessel glibly down the river glides. Th' indignant king invok'd the powers above, His parent Phœbus, and almighty Jove, His wrongs to witness: and to sudden fate Doom'd in his fury the devoted state. Who dar'd delay the guilty maid to bring, From land or ocean, to their injur'd king, On their rebellious heads his wrath should fall, And vengeance merited o'ertake them all. Thus menac'd he; and, lo! the Colchian train Launch'd on that day their vessels in the main; Swift, on that day, unfurl'd their bellying sails, And all embarking caught the balmy gales. Nor deem ye this a well-train'd naval host; Like flocks of birds they scream around the coast. Juno, propitious to her favourite-crew, Inspir'd the breezes that serenely blew, That soon on Grecian land the fair might tread, And pour destruction down on Pelias' head. With the third morn, on Paphlagonia's shore, Where Halys rolls his stream, the heroes moor. Medea here ordain'd a solemn rite To Hecate, the magic queen of night. But what, or how she form'd the potent spell, Let none enquire, nor shall my numbers tell: Fear holds me silent. Here the pious band Erect a sacred temple on the strand, Sacred to Hecate, night's awful queen; And still beside the beach the holy fane is seen. And now the words of Phineus, old and blind, Recurr'd to Jason, and each hero's mind. From Æa he advis'd them to pursue A different course, a course no pilot knew, Which Argos thus delineates to the crew: ‘When towards Orchomenos our course we bent, ‘We took that route th' instructive prophet meant. ‘For in times past a different road was known, ‘And this thy priests, Ægyptian Thebes, have shewn. ‘Before the stars adorn'd the saphire-sphere, ‘Or Danaus' race had reach'd th' enquirer's ear; ‘In Greece the bold Arcadians reign'd alone, ‘And, ere bright Cynthia deck'd her silver throne, ‘On acorns liv'd, the food of savage man; ‘Before Deucalion's sons their reign began; ‘With harvests, then, was fertile Ægypt crown'd, ‘Mother of mighty chiefs, of old renown'd; ‘Then the broad Triton, beauteous to behold, ‘His streams prolific o'er the country roll'd. ‘For Jove descends not there in bounteous rains, ‘But inundations fertilize the plains. ‘Hence rose the matchless chief (if same says true) ‘Who conquer'd Europe's realms and Asia's too; ‘His hardy troops embattled at his side, ‘He on his valour and those troops rely'd. ‘He built and peopled with superior skill ‘Unnumber'd cities, some remaining still. ‘Though many ages now have pass'd away, ‘Yet Æa stands, nor hastens to decay; ‘Peopled at first by his adventurous train, ‘Whose long-continued race ev'n now remain. ‘With care they still recording tablets keep ‘Of all the limits of the land and deep, ‘Wherever rivers flow, or storms prevail, ‘Wherever men can march, or ships can sail. ‘A river, stately-winding, deep and wide, ‘From far, far distant mountains rolls its tide; ‘Where ships of burden sure protection claim: ‘Long is its course and Ister is its name. ‘Far, o'er Riphæan hills, where Boreas reigns, ‘He undivided flows thro' various plains; ‘But when thro' Thrace and Scythian climes he glides, ‘In two broad streams his rapid flood divides: ‘This to th' Ionian sea its circuit sweeps, ‘That wider stretches to Trinacria's deeps, ‘Whose lofty shores your Grecian coast command, ‘If Achelöus flow through Grecian land.’ He said: a favouring sign the Goddess gave, Which with new courage animates the brave. Celestial fires emit a living ray, And beams of glory point the certain way. Here, leaving Lycus' valiant son behind, They spread with joy their canvass to the wind. Afar the Paphlagonian hills appear; And from Carambis' cape remote they steer, Led by the heavenly light and kindly gales, Till in broad Ister's flood the vessel sails. Where the Cyanean rocks o'erlook the main, Part of the Colchians steer their course in vain; While they, whose counsels sage Absyrtus guides, Cut through the mouth call'd Calon Ister's tides. Outsailing thus yon' tardy ships, they sweep With skilful oars the wide Ionian deep. An isle, which Ister's branching streams comprise, Peuce, triangular, before them lies: Wide o'er the beach its ample base extends, And in the flood its pointed angle ends. The two broad streams, that round the island flow, They by Arecos' name and Calon know. Below this isle Absyrtus and his crew Through the wide Calon their swift course pursue: Above it sailing Jason's comrades stray, And through Arecos wind their distant way. Such naval force dismay'd the neighbouring swains; They left their fleecy flocks and verdant plains: The ships in view, with terrour struck they stood, And deem'd them monsters rising from the flood: Never beheld they from their native shore Ships proudly sailing on the seas before. For the fierce Scythians and Sigynnian race Maintain'd no commerce with the sons of Thrace: Nor Sindians e'er, who roam the desert plain, Nor e'er Graucenians cross'd the seas for gain. When Argo's crew the mount Angurus pass'd, And reach'd the rock Cauliacus at last, (Ister near which his stately stream divides And mingles with the deep his sever'd tides;) And distant left the wide Talaurian plain, Then had the Colchians plough'd the Chronian main. Here, lest the vessel scape, they cautious stay, And strive to intercept her in her way. At length appears to their expecting view On Ister's flood the enterprising crew. Two lovely sea-girt isles their notice claim'd, Dear to Diana, and the Brugi nam'd. Superb in one a sacred temple rose, And one secur'd them from their Colchian foes. Her power revering whom these isles obey, The foe had quitted them without delay. Each isle beside was throng'd with Colchian hosts, Who, guarding every pass, protect the coasts. For troops of enemies embattled stood, Far ev'n as Nestis and Salango's flood. Their numbers few, the Mynian chiefs forbear To wage with numerous foes unequal war. Preventive of debate, this truce was seal'd; That, since the king propos'd the Fleece to yield, Whether by open force, or arts unknown, Conquest the daring combatant might crown, He, though reluctant, must resign his right, And the contested prize the victor's toil requite. That, from the crowd with secrecy convey'd, Diana's fane should guard the magic maid, Till mid' the sceptred princes one arose To fix their vague opinions, and propose, Or to restore her to her sire's embrace, Or in Orchomenos's city place, Or freely grant her to embark in peace, And with the Grecian heroes visit Greece. When now, long pondering, the suspicious maid Had learn'd, and all their secret counsels weigh'd, Tormenting cares disturb'd her mind's repose, And keen reflection added woes to woes. Aside she then, from all th' assembled crew, With cautious secrecy her Jason drew: Him, thus withdrawn, th' impassion'd maid address'd, And told the secret sorrows of her breast: ‘Say, what the cause that hostile hosts are join'd, ‘And leagues, destructive of my peace, combin'd? ‘Say, have these charms, with rapture once explor'd, ‘Lull'd to forgetfulness my faithless lord? ‘Hath time effac'd the promises he made, ‘When in the needful hour he ask'd mine aid? ‘Where now thine oaths, prefer'd to mighty Jove? ‘Where now thy tenders of unalter'd love? ‘Curs'd oaths! which bade me all I love disclaim, ‘Friends, parents, country, every honour'd name! ‘Forlorn and vex'd lest thou should'st toil in vain, ‘I with the plaintive halcyon sought the main. ‘I follow'd but to shield thee from alarms, ‘When bulls breath'd fire, and giants rose in arms. ‘Now is the Fleece, for which ye sail'd, possess'd, ‘And by my foolish fondness thou art bless'd. ‘Bless'd thou; but me what secret sorrows vex, ‘Whose deeds reflect dishonour on my sex! ‘Me as thy daughter, sister, wife they brand, ‘Who dare attend thee to a distant land. ‘But stay, protect me, ease my weight of woe, ‘Nor to my royal sire without me go. ‘Oh! think on justice, and revere thine oath, ‘Which both consented to, which bound us both: ‘Or instant, should'st thou every tie evade, ‘In this frail bosom plunge the pointed blade. ‘Thus frantic love its due desert shall see, ‘And death come grateful to a wretch like me. ‘Think, should the king exert his sovereign sway, ‘And with my brother destine me to stay, ‘(That king with whom ye both with treacherous aim ‘Have form'd a league, subversive of my fame;) ‘Oh! how shall I behold my father's face? ‘With courage I! not shrinking at disgrace! ‘No; stung by conscience, I forestall my fate, ‘And feel the horrours which my crimes create. ‘Back o'er the seas, mid' raging tempests borne, ‘Long may'st thou wander joyless and forlorn. ‘Ne'er may thy boasted patroness and friend, ‘Juno, to thee her wonted aid extend. ‘Stern fate may still severer toils ordain, ‘And thou, false wretch, remember me in vain. ‘Oh! may the Fleece deceive thy ravish'd sight, ‘And, like a vision, vanish into night. ‘Rise may my Furies, vengeance to demand, ‘And distant drive thee from thy native land. ‘From thee, their guilty source, my sorrows flow: ‘Share now thy part, and suffer woe for woe. ‘Thine oaths no more a slighted maid shall wrong, ‘Nor this perfidious truce protect thee long.’ Stung with despair, she utter'd thus her grief, Thus to her angry spirit gave relief. To burn the ship forth rush'd th' impetuous dame, And wrap its heaven-built sides in sudden flame; Resolv'd in thought, as now the vessel blaz'd, To perish dauntless in the flame she rais'd: But Jason thus, with boding fears impress'd, Sooth'd the mad tumults of Medea's breast: “Cease, heavenly maid, nor wound a lover's ear “With words unwelcome, and unfit to hear. “The common safety bids us all unite “To gain a timely respite from the fight. “See, fair protectress, to restore thee lost, “What clouds of enemies surround the coast. “The country arms thy brother's cause to aid, “And bear thee to thy sire a captive maid. “Against such force should we our arms oppose, “Perish might all our host, o'erpower'd by foes: “Then, sad to think! if, every hero slain, “In long captivity must thou remain. “Our arts perfidious will this truce conceal, “Whose baneful influence must thy brother feel. “Bereav'd of him, the Colchians' cause to aid, “And to recover thee, a captive maid, “No more the neighbouring forces will unite: “Instant will I renew the desperate fight, “Secure my wish'd return, and vindicate my right.” Thus spoke he mild: the mischief-brooding maid Told her dark purpose, and, ‘O think,’ she said, ‘Think, Jason, now: oppose we, as beseems, ‘To their destructive deeds destructive schemes. ‘Urg'd first by Love, in errour's maze I stray'd, ‘And through that God is every lust obey'd. ‘Decline the fight, till I the youth betray, ‘And to your hands consign, an easy prey. ‘With presents be the heedless stripling lur'd: ‘Heralds, of faith approv'd, by me procur'd, ‘Ere long a secret audience shall obtain, ‘And to my purposes Absyrtus gain. ‘My plan (I reck not) if it please, pursue: ‘Go, slay my brother, and the fight renew.’ Such were the snares the treacherous lovers laid; And by large presents was the prince betray'd. The heralds with these specious presents bore The veil Hypsipyle so lately wore. Each Grace in Naxos' isle, with art divine, Wrought the rich raiment for the God of wine; He gave it Thoas, his illustrious heir, And Thoas to Hypsipyle the fair; She gave it Jason: wondering you behold, And with new transport trace th' embroider'd gold. What time with large nectareous draughts oppress'd, On the soft vesture Bacchus sunk to rest, Close by his side the Cretan maid reclin'd, At Naxos' isle whom Theseus left behind; From that bless'd hour the robe, with odours fill'd, Ambrosial fragrance wide around distill'd. Her guileful purposes the magic maid In order thus before the heralds laid: That, soon as night her sable shade had spread, And to the temple was Medea led, Thither Absyrtus should repair, and hear A project pleasing to a brother's ear: How she, the Golden Fleece in triumph borne, Would to Æeta speed her wish'd return; How Phrixus' treacherous sons prolong'd her stay; And her to cruel foes consign'd a prey. Then far she flung her potent spells in air, Which lur'd the distant savage from his lair. Curse of mankind! from thee contentions flow, Disastrous Love! and every heart-felt woe: Thy darts the children of thy foes infest, As now they rankle in Medea's breast. How, vanquish'd by her wiles, Absyrtus fell, In seemly order now my Muse must tell. Medea now secur'd in Dian's fane, The Colchians hasten to their ships again. Jason meanwhile lies in close ambush, bent Absyrtus and his friends to circumvent. Him, yet unpractis'd in his sister's guile, His ready ship had wafted to the isle: Conceal'd in night they tugg'd their toilsome oars, Till in the bay secure the vessel moors. Alone, in confidence, the stripling came, And at Diana's porch approach'd the dame, (She like a torrent look'd, when swoln with rain, Which foaming terrifies the village-swain;) To learn what snare her wily art could lay, To drive these bold adventurers away. And all was plann'd; when from his ambuscade Sprung Æson's son, and shook his lifted blade. The conscious sister, stung with secret dread, Lest her own eyes should view Absyrtus dead, Turn'd from the murderous scene aside distress'd, And veil'd her guilty face beneath her vest. As falls an ox beneath the striker's blow, So was Absyrtus laid by Jason low. Near that bright fane the neighbouring Brugi built, He eyes his victim, and completes his guilt. Here sunk he low; and to his bleeding side, Compressing both his hands, the hero died. Medea's veil receiv'd the purple flood, And her fair vesture blush'd with brother's blood. Hell's blackest Fury the dire scene survey'd, And mark'd with sidelong eye the reeking blade. The pious rite for blood in secret spilt, Jason fulfils, and expiates his guilt. The skin he rases from the body slain, Thrice licks the blood, thrice spits it out again. Then with collected earth the corse he press'd; And still his bones with Absyrteans rest. When in full prospect the bright flambeau blaz'd, Which to conduct the chiefs Medea rais'd, Elate with hope the radiant guide they view, And near the Colchian vessel Argo drew. As lions fierce the timorous flocks dismay, Leap o'er the folds, and drive them far away; As trembling doves before the kite retreat, So before Argo flies the Colchian fleet. Furious as flame, on all the host they prey'd, And low in death was each assailant laid. Jason at length, to aid his valiant crew, Who little need his aid, appear'd in view. For not a fear their gallant hearts oppress'd, Save what their Jason's safety might suggest. The chiefs assembled with Medea sat, And on their future voyage thus debate; Peleus began: ‘Now, ere Aurora rise, ‘A speedy embarkation I advise: ‘A different course with caution let us choose, ‘From that far different which the foe pursues. ‘For (such my sanguine hope) when morning-light ‘Yon slaughter'd heaps discloses to their sight, ‘No words will win them to pursue us far, ‘No tongue entice them to renew the war. ‘Sedition soon, their prince Absyrtus dead, ‘Will, like a pest, o'er all their navy spread: ‘Secure and free shall we recross the main, ‘Their forces scatter'd, and their sovereign slain.’ He said; the chiefs consented, and with haste Re-enter'd Argo, and their oars embrac'd. Hard by Electris, last of isles, they row, Near which, Eridanus, thy waters flow. Soon as their leader's fate the Colchians knew, They vow'd destruction to the Grecian crew; And, eager to o'ertake the Mynian train, Had travers'd in their wrath the boundless main, But Juno, as her thunder awful roll'd, Presag'd her vengeance, and their pride control'd. Dreading Æeta's ire, the vanquish'd host Far distant voyag'd from the Colchian coast. Unnumber'd ports the scatter'd fleet explor'd: Some to those isles repair'd where Jason moor'd, Nam'd from Absyrtus: some, where stately flows The flood Illyricum, expect repose; Beside whose bank a lofty tower they rear'd, Where Cadmus' and Harmonia's tomb appear'd; Here with the natives dwell they. Others roam Till midst Ceraunian rocks they find a home; Ceraunian nam'd, since Jove's red thunder tore Their ships that anchor'd on the neighbouring shore. But towards th' Hyllean port the heroes bear, And, fortune smiling, fix their halsers there. For many an isle projected o'er the tide, Near which no vessel could with safety ride. No hostile arts th' Hylleans now devise: They teach the Mynians where their voyage lies; And for their friendly intercourse obtain The largest tripod from Apollo's fane. For, doubtful of the Fleece, when Jason came To hear responses from the Pythian dame, Enrich'd, and honour'd from the shrine he trod With two bright tripods, given by Delphi's God. 'Twas doom'd no power should lay the country waste, Within whose confines were these tripods plac'd. Hid, for this cause, in earth the sumptuous prize Hard by the fair Hyllean city lies; Deep, deep it lies, with ponderous earth oppress'd, That there unseen it might for ever rest. King Hyllus, whom in fam'd Phœacia's shore Fair Melite to great Alcides bore, To mortal view was manifest no more. Nausithoüs, to youthful Hyllus kind, The heedless stripling in his courts confin'd; (For, when to Macris' isle Alcides fled, That far-fam'd isle, which infant Bacchus fed, To expiate his guilt, and wash the stain Of blood yet streaming from his children slain, Here, as beside his favourite-beach he rov'd, The naiad Melite he saw and lov'd, The daughter of Ægëus, fair and young, From whose caresses hopeful Hyllus sprung.) But he, to manhood ripening, wish'd to roam Far from his sovereign's eye and regal home: The native islanders augment his train, And with their leader tempt the Chronian main. Nausithoüs complied with each demand, And Hyllus settled on th' Illyric strand: But, as he strove his scatter'd herd to shield, A boor's rude weapon stretch'd him on the field. How cross these seas, how round th' Ausonian shores, And the Ligurian isles they plied their oars, Ye Muses, tell: what tokens still remain Of Argo's voyage, what her feats, explain: Say, to what end, by what impelling gales She o'er remotest seas unfurl'd her sails. All-seeing Jove their perfidy discern'd, And for Absyrtus slain with anger burn'd. By Circe's mystic rites heaven's sire decreed The guilt to expiate of so base a deed. To sufferings dire, but what no mortal knew, He, ere they safe return'd, foredoom'd the crew. Beyond th' Hyllean land their course they steer'd: Remote the vast Liburnian isles appear'd, Late fill'd with Colchians; Pityëa fair, And rocky Issa, are the names they bear. These islands past, Cercyra's cliffs they greet, Where dwelt (for here had Neptune chose her seat) Cercyra: he, by tender passions sway'd, From distant Phliuns fetch'd the black-ey'd maid: Melaine her admiring sailors name, As through dark groves they view the swarthy dame. Fleet as the vessel sails before the wind, Cerossus, Melite they leave behind. Soon on Nymphæa, though remote, she gains, Where Atlas' daughter, queen Calypso, reigns. The crew conjectur'd, through far distant skies They saw the tall Ceraunian mountains rise. And now Jove's purposes and vengeful rage Propitious Juno's anxious thoughts engage. That every toil with glory might be crown'd, And no disastrous rocks their ship surround, She wak'd the brisker gales in Argo's aid, Till in Electris' isle she rode embay'd. Sudden, the vessel, as she sail'd along, Spoke, wondrous portent! as with human tongue: Her sturdy keel of Dodonean oak, By Pallas vocal made, prophetic spoke. This solemn voice shook every heart with fear: They deem'd the Thunderer's threaten'd vengeance near. ‘Expect,’ says Argo, ‘storms and wintry seas, ‘'Till Circe's rites the wrath of Jove appease. ‘Ye guardian twins, who aid our great design, ‘By humble prayer the heavenly powers incline ‘To steer me safe to each Ausonian bay, ‘And to the haunts of Circe point my way.’ Thus Argo spoke, as night her shades display'd: The sons of Leda listen'd and obey'd. Before th' immortal Powers their hands they spread; All, save these chiefs, were struck with silent dread. The canvass wide-distended by the gales, Swift down Eridanus the galley sails. Here Jove's dread bolt transfix'd the stripling's side, Who greatly dar'd the car of Phœbus guide. This flood receiv'd him; and the flaming wound Still steams, and spreads offensive vapours round. The feathery race, as o'er the flood they fly, Wrapp'd in sulphureous exhalations die. The poplar's winding bark around them spread, Apollo's daughters wail their brother dead. Down their fair cheeks bright tears of amber run, Sink in the sand, and harden by the sun. When boisterous winds the troubled waters urge, And o'er its bank ascends the swelling surge, These amber gems, swept by the tide away, Their pearly tribute to the river pay. But, down the stream, as Celtic legends tell, The tears of Phœbus floated as they fell In amber drops, what time from angry Jove The God withdrew, and left the realms above: To the far Hyperborean race he fled; Griev'd for his favourite Æsculapius dead. From fair Coronis sprung this godlike son, Where Amyros' streams near Lacerea run. Strangers to mirth, the pensive Mynians muse On their hard lot, and strengthening food refuse. Loathing the stench these putrid streams emit, Sickening and spiritless whole days they sit; Whole nights they hear the sorrowing sisters tell, How by the bolts of Jove their brother fell. Their mingled tears, as o'er the stream they weep, Like drops of oil float down the rapid deep. The Rhone's broad channel Argo's keel divides, Which mingles with Eridanus its tides: There, where the confluent floods unite their force, Boisterous they foam. The Rhone derives its source From caverns deep, which, far from mortal sight, Lead to the portals, and the realms of night. One stream its tribute to th' Ionian pays, One to the wide Sardinian ocean strays; Thro' seven wide mouths it disembogues its tides, Where foaming to the sea its stream divides. This winding stream transmits th' adventurous train To lakes that delug'd all the Celtic plain. Disastrous fate had here their labour foil'd, And of her boasted prowess Argo spoil'd, (For through a creek to ocean's depths convey'd, To sure destruction had the heroes stray'd;) But Juno hasten'd from on high, and stood On a tall rock, and shouted o'er the flood. All heard, and all with sudden terrour shook; For loud around them bursts of thunder broke. Admonish'd thus, submissive they return, And steering back their better course discern. Mid' Celtæ and Ligurians long they stray'd, But reach'd the sea-beat shore by Juno's aid: O'er them each day her cloudy veil she drew, And thus from human sight conceal'd the crew; Whose ship had now the broad, mid channel pass'd, And rode amidst the Stœchades at last: For Jove's twin sons had pray'd, nor pray'd in vain. Hence rear they altars, and due rites ordain To these kind Powers, whose influential aid Not only Argo's bold adventurers sway'd; But later voyagers, by Jove's decree, Have own'd their happy influence o'er the sea. The Stœchades now lessening from their view, Swift to Æthalia's isle the vessel flew. With chalks, that, as they cover'd, ting'd the shore, The heroes rubb'd their wearied bodies o'er. Here are their quoits and wondrous armour fram'd, Here is their port display'd, Argoüs nam'd. Hence sailing, they the Tyrrhene shores survey, As through Ausonia's deeps they cleave their liquid way. Æea's celebrated port they reach, And fasten here their halsers to the beach. Here saw they Circe, as in ocean's bed, Dismay'd with nightly dreams, she plung'd her head. For thus the sorceress dream'd; that blood and gore Had smear'd her walls, and flow'd around her floor: That all her treasur'd stores were wrapp'd in flame, With which she lur'd each passenger that came: That copious streams of blood her hand apply'd, And her fears vanish'd as the flames subside. For this the magic dame, as morning rose, Wash'd in the cleansing wave her locks and clothes. Monsters, unlike the savage, bestial race, Unlike to humankind in gait or face, Limbs not their own support whose hideous frame, As sheep their shepherd follow, these their dame. Such monsters once the pregnant earth disclos'd, Of heterogeneous shapes and limbs compos'd: No drying winds had then the soil condens'd, No solar rays their genial warmth dispens'd; But time perfection to each creature gave: Monsters like these were seen in Circe's cave. All, stedfast gazing on her form and face, Pronounc'd the sorceress of Æeta's race. Those terrors vanish'd, which her dream inspir'd, Back to her gloomy cell the dame retir'd. Close in her guileful hand she grasp'd each guest, And bade them follow where her footsteps press'd. The crowd aloof at Jason's mandate stay'd, While he accompanied the Colchian maid. Together thus they Circe's steps pursue, Till her enchanting cave arose in view. Their visit's cause her troubled mind distress'd; On downy seats she plac'd each princely guest. They round her hearth sat motionless and mute: (With plaintive suppliants such manners suit) Her folded hands her blushing face conceal; Deep in the ground he fix'd the murderous steel; Nor dare they once, in equal sorrow drown'd, Lift their dejected eyelids from the ground. Circe beheld their guilt: she saw they fled From vengeance hanging o'er the murderer's head. The holy rites, approv'd of Jove, she pays: (Jove, thus appeas'd, his hasty vengeance stays) These rites from guilty stains the culprits clear, Who lowly suppliant at her cell appear. To expiate their crime in order due, First to her shrine a sucking pig she drew, Whose nipples from its birth distended stood: Its neck she struck, and bath'd their hands in blood. Next with libations meet and prayer she ply'd Jove, who acquits the suppliant homicide. Without her door a train of Naiads stand, Administering whate'er her rites demand; Within, the flames, that round the hearth arise, Waste, as she prays, the kneaded sacrifice: That thus the Furies' vengeful wrath might cease, And Jove appeas'd dismiss them both in peace, Whether they came to expiate the guilt Of friends' or strangers' blood by treachery spilt. Circe arose, her mystic rites complete, And plac'd the princes on a splendid seat. Near them she sat, and urg'd them to explain Their plan and progress o'er the dangerous main: Whence rose the wish to visit Circe's isle, And thus beneath her roof converse awhile. For still on every thought the vision press'd, And its remembrance still disturb'd her rest. Soon as the sorceress saw Medea raise From earth those eyes which shot a beamy blaze, Anxious she wish'd to hear her native tongue, Conjecturing from her features whence she sprung. For all Sol's race are beauteous as their sire; Their radiant eyes emit celestial fire. The willing maid complied with each demand, And in the language of her native land Her story told; each strange event declar'd, What countries they had seen, what dangers shar'd; Her sister's counsels how they sway'd her breast, How with the sons of Phrixus she transgress'd; How from her father fled, his threats disdain'd: But still untold her brother's fate remain'd. His fate th' enchantress knew; no arts could hide The murderous deed: she pitied and reply'd: ‘Ah! wretch, dire mischiefs thy return await. ‘Hope not to shun thy father's vengeful hate; ‘Resolv'd on right, he to the realms of Greece ‘Will close pursue thee, nor his fury cease, ‘Till he avenge the murder of his son: ‘For deeds of blackest darkness hast thou done. ‘But go, at once my kin and suppliant, free, ‘Nor fear additional distress from me. ‘Thy lover hence, far hence thyself remove, ‘Who scorn'dst a father's for a vagrant's love. ‘Here supplicate no more: my heart disclaims ‘Thy guilty wanderings and sinister aims.’ She spoke: the maid lamented; o'er her head Her veil she cast, and many a tear she shed. Her trembling hand the hero rais'd with speed, And from the cave of Circe both recede. By watchful Iris taught, Saturnia knew What time from Circe's cave they both withdrew. To mark their steps commission'd Iris staid, On whom these fresh injunctions Juno laid: ‘Haste, Iris, now; thy pinions wide expand, ‘And bear once more Saturnia's dread command. ‘Go, Thetis rouze from ocean's dark retreat; ‘Her potent aid my projects will complete. ‘Spread then towards Vulcan's shores thy speedy wing, ‘Where round his anvils ceaseless hammers ring. ‘Bid him no more his boisterous bellows ply, ‘Till heaven-built Argo sail securely by. ‘Then to the Deity, whose sovereign sway ‘Controls the winds, whom raging storms obey, ‘Haste; and request that every rising gale ‘Be hush'd, and silence o'er the seas prevail: ‘That round the waves serenest zephyrs play, ‘Till Argo anchors in Phæacia's bay.’ She said: and Iris, poiz'd on airy wings, From the bright summit of Olympus springs: Descends impetuous down th' Ægean deeps, Where in his watery caverns Nereus sleeps. To Thetis first repairs the winged maid; Solicits and obtains her potent aid. Vulcan she next in humble prayer address'd; The God of fire complied with her request: His bellows heave their windy sides no more, Nor his shrill anvils shake the distant shore. Her wants to Æolus she next disclos'd: And while her wearied limbs she here repos'd, Thetis from all her Naiad-train withdrew, And from her Nereus to Olympus flew. Juno with transport hail'd her sea-born guest, Whom near her throne she seated, and address'd: ‘O, hear my tale, bright Goddess of the main: ‘Thou know'st my care for Jason and his train; ‘Thou know'st how Juno's arm alone upheld, ‘And through the jutting rocks their ship impell'd: ‘Around whose sides fierce, fiery tempests rave, ‘And the huge crag is whiten'd by the wave. ‘Now must they sail near Scylla's awful height, ‘And where the rock Charybdis forms a streight. ‘Thee yet an infant in my arms I press'd, ‘And more than all thy sister-nymphs caress'd. ‘Revering me, the wife of sovereign Jove, ‘Thou scorn'dst the tenders of his lawless love. ‘(For him a mortal beauty now inflames, ‘And now he revels with celestial dames.) ‘And Jove, in vengeance for his slighted bed, ‘Swore, not a Deity should Thetis wed. ‘Nor could the fervour of his love abate, ‘Till Themis thus disclos'd the will of fate; ‘That from thy womb in future times should spring, ‘Superior to his sire, an infant-king. ‘Dreading th' event, lest in some future day ‘This infant-king should claim celestial sway, ‘Thee Jove abandon'd to secure his throne, ‘And reign unrival'd ever and alone. ‘But, lo! I gave, thy bridal bed to grace, ‘A mortal husband worthy thy embrace; ‘I made thee mother of a happy line, ‘And to thy nuptials call'd the Powers divine. ‘Myself, in honour to the godlike pair, ‘Deign'd on that day the bridal torch to bear. ‘Soon as thy son (believe the truths you hear) ‘Shall in Elysium's blissful plains appear, ‘Whom kindly now the fostering Naiads guard ‘In Chiron's mansion, of thy milk debarr'd, ‘In Hymen's silken chains the hero led, ‘Must share the honours of Medea's bed. ‘Oh! be a mother's tenderest care display'd, ‘Succour thy Peleus, and thy daughter aid. ‘Hath he transgress'd? thy rising wrath subdue; ‘For Ate's dire effects th' immortals rue. ‘Vulcan, I ween, obsequious to my will, ‘His fires will stifle, and his bellows still; ‘His boisterous waves will Æolus restrain, ‘And zephyrs only fan the curling main, ‘Till Argo anchors in Phæacia's bay. ‘But shelves and stormy seas obstruct her way; ‘These, these I dread: but, with thy train expert, ‘Be thine the care these mischiefs to avert. ‘Safe from Charybdis' gulf the vessel guide, ‘Safe from loud Scylla's all-absorbing tide; ‘Scylla, the terrour of Ausonia's shore, ‘Whom Phorcuns to infernal Hecat bore, ‘Cratæis nam'd. Oh! summon all thy pow'r, ‘Lest her voracious jaws my chiefs devour. ‘Hope's cheerly dawn if haply thou discern, ‘Snatch from the watery grave the sinking stern.’ “If 'tis resolv'd,” replies th' assenting queen, “Tempests to curb, and oceans to serene, “Fear not; but in my proffer'd aid confide: “This arm shall convoy Argo o'er the tide. “The surge subsiding shall confess my sway, “While harmless zephyrs round the canvass play. “Now must I traverse the wide fields of air, “And to my sisters' crystal grots repair; “Request their aid, and hasten to the shores, “Where anchor'd Argo unmolested moors: “That each brave comrade, at the dawn of day, “With heart elate may cleave the liquid way.” She spoke, and through th' aërial regions sped, Then in the pools of ocean plung'd her head. At Thetis' call the sister Nereids came, And flock'd obedient round their oozy dame. Juno's commands she bade the sisters heed, And to th' Ausonian deep descend with speed. Swifter than lightning, or than Phœbus' beams, The Goddess darted thro' the yielding streams; Till, gliding smooth beside the Tyrrhene strand, Her speedy footstep press'd th' Ææan land. Along the winding beach the Mynians stray, And while with quoits and darts their hours away. Here Thetis singled from the gallant band Peleus her spouse, and press'd the hero's hand: Unseen by all the host, his hand she press'd; By all, save Peleus, whom she thus address'd: ‘Loiter not here; but with returning light ‘Unfurl your sails, nor Juno's counsels slight. ‘Safe thro' th' Erratic rocks your ship to guide, ‘Which frown tremendous o'er the tossing tide, ‘For this the sea-green sisters join their force, ‘And smooth through dangerous seas your destin'd course. ‘My form, what time we urge the foaming keel, ‘By you not unobserv'd, to none reveal; ‘Lest, as before, your folly I chastise, ‘And to more desperate heights my vengeance rise.’ She said, and vanish'd to the deeps below. The wondering chief was pierc'd with keenest woe. For since the dame, with indignation fir'd, Had from her Peleus' hated bed retir'd, Unseen till now she lurk'd: the strife begun From this unweeting cause, her infant-son. For, soon as night diffus'd its darkest shade, Her young Achilles o'er the flame she laid, And, at return of day, with ceaseless toil Applied to all his limbs ambrosial oil, That youth might triumph o'er th' attacks of time, Nor creeping age impair his vigorous prime, The father saw, as from his bed he rose, Fierce, ambient flames his infant's limbs enclose; And, as he gaz'd; his rueful cries confess'd The boding sorrows of a parent's breast. Fool! for his queen, who heard her lord deplore, Dash'd in a rage her infant on the floor. Then fleet as air, or like a dream of night, She vanish'd sudden from his odious sight; Plung'd in her fury down the whelming main, Nor e'er emerg'd she from the waves again. For this he sorrow'd: but each sage command Which Thetis gave, he told his gallant band. They heard, and from their sports retir'd in haste; Then shar'd, recumbent, in a short repast. Sated, they catch the comforts of repose, Till, every toil renewing, morn arose. Soon as her radiant light illumin'd heav'n, And to their wish were breezy zephyrs giv'n, Quitting the land, they climb with nimble feet The lofty decks, and reassume their seat. Each to his toil returns alert and bold: They tear the griping anchor from its hold; They hoist the yard, their bracing ropes unbind, And give the flapping canvass to the wind. Swift sails the ship: soon to th' expecting crew Anthemoessa's isle arose in view. The Syrens here, from Acheloüs sprung, Allure the loitering sailors with their tongue, Who, fastening to the beach the corded stay, Neglect their voyage, and attend the lay. What time to Acheloüs' longing arms The Muse Terpsichore resign'd her charms, Their mutual love these wily songsters crown'd; Who lur'd, in times remote, with tempting sound Ceres' fair daughter, and fallacious shew A virgin-face, while wing'd like fowls they flew. On a bright eminence the charmers stand, And watch the vessels as they tug to land. Full many a mariner their songs betray, Who lists and lingers till he pines away. As Argo sail'd they rais'd their tuneful tongue; And here their halsers had the heroes hung, But Thracian Orpheus wak'd his wonted fire, And sung responsive to his heavenly lyre; That each resounding chord might pierce their ear, And none the music of the Syrens hear. Yet still they sung: still briskly, with the breeze, The vessel tilted o'er the curling seas. Butes alone became an easy prey, Who all enraptur'd listen'd to their lay. Erect, above the rowing chiefs, he stood, And frantic sprung into the faithless flood. His helpless hands he rais'd, the ship to gain, And, but for Venus' aid, had rais'd in vain: She, Eryx' honour'd queen, the wretch descry'd, And snatch'd him floundering from the foaming tide, His kind protectress, as her course she bends Where Lilybœum's ample cape extends. This dire mishap dishearten'd all the band, Who row with vigour from the traiterous strand. But other pests, more fatal to their freight, Threaten their progress to that dangerous streight, Where Scylla's rock projects its wave-worn side, And where Charybdis' gulf absorbs the tide. Dash'd by the driven waves the Planctæ roar'd, From whose cleft summits flames sulphureous pour'd. Thick, dusky clouds involve the darken'd skies, And hid are Phœbus' splendours from their eyes. Though Vulcan ceas'd from his assiduous toils, The fires flash thick, and fervid ocean boils. Here o'er the sailing pine the nymphs preside, While Thetis' forceful hands the rudder guide. As oft in shoals the sportive dolphins throng, Circling the vessel as she sails along, Whose playful gambols round the prow and stern The much-delighted mariners discern; Round Argo thus the toiling nymphs attend, And, led by Thetis, their assistance lend. O'erhanging black th' rocks' bleak brow they see, And gird their azure vestures to their knee. Now here, now there, as danger warns, they glide, And stem mid' crushing crags the troubled tide. Pendent on mountain-waves the vessel hung, That pierc'd her solid planks, and foam'd the rocks among. Above these rocks, here now the Nereids rise, And float on billows hid amidst the skies; Descending now to ocean's secret bed, They in his gulphy deeps conceal their head. As when along the beach, succinct for play, To toss the flying ball the Nereids stray, From hand to hand the sphere unerring flies, Nor ever on the ground inglorious lies; The sisters thus, with coadjutant force, High o'er the surge impel the vessel's course: From secret shelves her wave-dash'd sides they shove, Tho' sturdy billows strong against them strove. On a tall fragment that o'erlook'd the flood, His shoulder resting on his hammer, stood The sooty God: and from her starry skies Juno beheld the scene with stedfast eyes. Her hand around Minerva's neck she threw; For much Saturnia trembled at the view. Long as the vernal suns protract the light, So long in Argo's cause the nymphs unite. Propitious to their labours sprung the breeze, And the free vessel shot across the seas. Trinacria's verdant meads they soon survey, Where graze thy herds, illustrious God of day. Juno's commands obey'd, the watery train, Like diving mews, explore the deeps again. Coasting along, the bleating flocks they hear, And herds loud bellowing strike their listening ear. Sol's youngest daughter, Phaëthusa, leads The bleating flocks along the dewy meads; Propp'd on her silver crook the maid reclin'd: A stouter staff, with brazen ringlets join'd, Lampetie takes; whose herds the heroes fee Slunk to the brook, or browsing on the lea. Of sable hue no cattle you behold; Milkwhite are all, and tipp'd their horns with gold. They pass'd these meads by day; at day's decline They brush'd with pliant oars the yielding brine. At length Aurora's all-reviving ray Redden'd the waves, and shew their certain way. A fertile isle towers o'er th' Ionian tide, Ceraunia nam'd; the land two bays divide. Fame says, (forgive me, Muse, while I unveil, Reluctant too, a legendary tale;) A sickle lies conceal'd within this land, With which rash Saturn's mutilating hand His father castrated: for Ceres' aid Others assert this rural sickle made. For Ceres once, with love of Macris fir'd, To this fam'd isle, her favourite seat, retir'd. The Titans here she taught her arms to wield, And crop the bearded harvest of the field. This island hence, nurse of Phœacian swains, Th' expressive name of Drepane obtains. From mangled Uranus's blood they trace The source inglorious of Phœacia's race. Trinacria left, and numerous perils past, Here heaven-protected Argo moors at last. The heroes disembark'd Alcinoüs hails, And at their festive sacrifice regales. Mirth unremitted through the city runs, As though they welcom'd home their darling sons. The godlike guests their social part sustain, Joyous as though they press'd Hæmonia's plain: But ere that distant plain delights their view, The chiefs must buckle on their arms anew. For, lo! those Colchians who adventurous stray'd Through deeps unknown, and enter'd undismay'd The dire Cyanean rocks, here throng the coast, And wait th' arrival of the Grecian host. The forfeit maid should Argo's crew refuse, War in each sad, disastrous shape ensues. Arm'd and resolv'd they threaten instant fight, And future fleets t' assert their monarch's right. But king Alcinoüs interpos'd his aid, And, ere they rush'd to fight, their wrath allay'd. Arete's knee the suppliant virgin press'd, And thus th' associate band and queen address'd: ‘O queen,’ exclaim'd she, ‘lend thy timely aid ‘To save from Colchian hands a suffering maid. ‘With russian rage to bear me hence they come, ‘And to my wrathful sire conduct me home. ‘Thou know'st, if one, like me, of humankind, ‘How prone to err is man's unstable mind. ‘Deem me no slave to lust's usurping pow'r; ‘Prudence forsook me in the needful hour. ‘Be witness, Sun, and thou, whose every rite ‘Is wrapp'd, dire Hecate, in sable night, ‘How I reluctant left my native home, ‘And with rude foreigners abhor'd to roam. ‘Fear wing'd my flight; and, having once transgress'd, ‘To flee I judg'd my last resource and best. ‘Still have I liv'd, as with my father, chaste, ‘My spotless zone fast girded to my waist. ‘Oh! may my tale, fair princess, claim thy tears; ‘Oh! teach thy lord compassion as he hears. ‘On thee may all th' immortal Gods bestow ‘Beauty and life, exempt from age and woe; ‘Cities, that need no bold invaders dread, ‘And a fair progeny to crown thy bed.’ In tears she spoke: then to each gallant chief Told in these plaintive strains her tale of grief: ‘Low at your feet, ye warriours, suppliant view ‘A princess doom'd to wretchedness for you. ‘Yok'd were the bulls, and, desperate as they rose, ‘Crush'd by my aid were hosts of giant-foes. ‘Yes, soon Hæmonia the rich prize will see, ‘And boast of conquests which she owes to me. ‘My country I, my parents, palace left, ‘To pine through life, of all its joys berest; ‘But gave to you, a base, ungrateful train, ‘To see your country and your friends again. ‘Spoil'd of my beauty's bloom by fate severe, ‘In endless exile must I languish here. ‘Revere your oaths; Erynnis' vengeance dread, ‘Who heaps her curses on the perjur'd head: ‘Dread heaven's sure wrath, if, to my sire restor'd, ‘My shame or ruin wait his desperate word. ‘No sheltering shrine, no fortress near, I fly ‘To you alone, on your defence rely. ‘Yet why on you? who, merciless and mute, ‘Have heard my cries, nor seconded my suit; ‘Unmov'd have seen me lift my suppliant hand ‘To the kind princess of this foreign land. ‘Elate with hope the Golden Fleece to gain, ‘Colchos oppos'd you, and her king in vain: ‘But fearful now the battle to renew, ‘Ye dread detachments, nor will fight with few.’ She said; and all, who heard her suppliant moan, Cheer'd her sad heart, and check'd the rising groan. Each gallant man his brandish'd spear display'd, And vow'd assistance to the suffering maid, Shook his drawn sword, a prelude to the fight, Resolv'd on vengeance, and resolv'd on right. Night now dispers'd the faint remains of day, And all the slumbering world confess'd its sway: Grateful its gloom to men with toils oppress'd; Grateful to all but her, with sleep unbless'd. She, hapless fair, her painful vigils kept; Revolving still her griefs, she watch'd and wept. As at the distaff toils th' industrious dame, Whose frequent tears her orphan children claim. All night she toils, while clinging round they stand, Wail their lost sire, and his return demand. Swift down her cheek descends the silent tear: So hard the lot fate destines her to bear! Like her's Medea's copious tears descend, Such agonizing griefs her tortur'd bosom rend. The royal pair retir'd with wonted state From the throng'd city to their palace-gate. On their soft couch reclin'd, at evening's close, Long conference held they on Medea's woes. Thus to Alcinöus the queen express'd The kind suggestions of her pitying breast: ‘Oh! may the Minyans, prince, thy favours share: ‘Oh! shield from Colchian foes an injur'd fair. ‘Not distant far Hæmonia's plains extend, ‘And near our island Argo's frontiers end. ‘But far remote Æeta reigns; his name ‘Unknown to us, or faintly known by fame. ‘She, in whose sorrows now I bear a part, ‘Hath, to redress them, open'd all my heart. ‘Let no rude Colchian bear her hence away, ‘To her sire's vengeance a devoted prey. ‘Her error this: the fiery bulls to quell, ‘Fond and officious she prepar'd the spell. ‘Augmenting then (as oft offenders will) ‘Her first with future errors, ill with ill, ‘Far from her native home, impress'd with dread, ‘Far from her angry sire the damsel fled. ‘But bound is Jason by strong ties, says fame, ‘To wed the wanderer, and retrieve from shame, ‘Urge him not then, with many an added threat, ‘His faith to violate, his oaths forget; ‘Nor stimulate Æeta's wrath to rise: ‘Their daughters parents rigorously chastise. ‘Thus Pycteus, with parental zeal o'ercome, ‘Compell'd his child Antiope to roam. ‘Thus Danaë, by her wrathful sire secur'd, ‘Toss'd in the troubled deep distress endur'd. ‘Nor long since Eehetus, a wretch accurs'd, ‘With brazen pins his daughter's eye-balls pierc'd: ‘Pent in a dungeon's awful gloom she pin'd, ‘Doom'd by her savage sire obdurate brass to grind.’ She said: soft pity touch'd the sovereign's breast, Who thus his supplicating queen address'd: “In me, O queen, these heroes should descry, “For the fair sufferer's sake, a firm ally; “Soon should my arms the Colchian foes remove, “But I revere the just decrees of Jove. “Unsafe I deem Æeta to deride, “Who sways the sceptre with a monarch's pride; “Able, though distant, if averse from peace, “To scatter discord through the realms of Greece. “Hear my proposal then; which you, I trust, “And all who hear it, will applaud as just: “If still a virgin's spotless name she bear, “Safe to her sire's domains conduct the fair: “But if one bed the wedded pair contain, “I will not sever Hymen's silken chain. “Forbid it, heaven! that I in wrath expose “Her sinless offspring to insulting foes.” He said, and sunk to rest: his sage resolves Anxious and oft the wakeful queen revolves. She rose: their princess' footstep heard, arise Her female train, and each her wants supplies. ‘Go,’ to her page apart Arete said, ‘Bid Æson's valiant son the virgin wed. ‘Bid him no more Alcinoüs' ears assail ‘With long entreaties and a well-known tale. ‘Himself, unask'd, his advocate will go, ‘And tender these conditions to the foe: ‘If still the fair a spotless maid remain, ‘Soon shall she view her father's courts again; ‘But, if a matron's honour'd name she bear, ‘He will not separate the wedded pair.’ She said: her herald, eager to convey The royal message, sped without delay; To Æson's son he told Arete's word, And the kind counsels of her sovereign lord. Hard by their ship, in glistering arms array'd, Deep in the port of Hyllicus embay'd, He spies the chiefs, his embassy repeats, And every gallant heart with transport beats. They crown the goblets to the Powers divine, And drag th' accustom'd victims to the shrine: Then for the pensive fair officious spread In a sequester'd grot the bridal bed. Hither, in days of yore, fair Macris came, Daughter of Aristæus, honour'd name! He taught mankind the virtues and the use Of the bee's labours, and the olive's juice. For, know, when Hermes infant-Bacchus bore, Snatch'd from the flames, to fair Eubœa's shore, Macris embrac'd him with a mother's love, And there, awhile, she nurs'd the seed of Jove, And there with honey fed; till Juno's spite Far from Eubœa's isle compell'd her flight. At length, of this Phœacian grot possess'd, She with vast opulence the natives bless'd. To deck with honours due the bridal bed, Around it wide the Golden Fleece was spread. With sweetest flowers, that deck or dale or hill, Th' assiduous nymphs their snowy bosoms fill. The Golden Fleece emits so bright a ray, They shone all radiant as the star of day, Inspiring love: the prize though strong desire Prompts them to touch, with reverence they retire. These are the daughters of the Ægeän flood, Those, Meletæum, haunt thy lofty wood. From groves, from streams, at Juno's call they ran, To grace the nuptials of this godlike man. The sacred grot, recorded still by fame, Bears to this day Medea's honour'd name. For here the nymphs, their veils around them spread, To nuptial joys the happy lovers led: And every chief, to guard the blissful spot, Clad in bright armour, stood before the grot, Lest hostile troops, with rude tumultuous noise, Should force an entrance, and distract their joys. Thus station'd, they protect the hallow'd ground, Their festive brows with leafy chaplets crown'd. As Orpheus struck his tuneful lyre, they sung, And Hymeneals round the grotto rung. But in Alcinoüs' court the fair to wed, O'er Jason's anxious mind disquiet spread: Full oft he wish'd Iolcos' coast to gain, And wed the virgin in his sire's domain; Such too Medea's wish: but fate severe Forc'd him to celebrate his nuptials here. For pleasure unalloy'd we look in vain; Pleasure to suffering man is mix'd with pain. Whether the Colchian foe had scorn'd or clos'd With the just terms Phœacia's prince propos'd, Of this they doubted: mid' the mirthful scene Fears, which these doubts suggested, intervene. Aurora now her orient beams display'd, And pierc'd the sullen night's surrounding shade. The circling shores and dew-bespangled ground Reflect her rays: the streets with noise resound. The citizens and Colchians, who possess'd The distant coast, awake from balmy rest. Impatient now his purpose to disclose, To plead Medea's cause the monarch rose. His hand sustain'd a sceptre's massy gold, Which kings, deciding right, were wont to hold. Around their prince, in glistering arms array'd, Phœacia's peers a seemly pomp display'd. Eager on each adventurous chief to gaze, A female troop beyond the city strays. In festive bands the distant swains unite: (For Juno had divulg'd the nuptial rite) One from his fold a ram selected brought, An heifer one, to feel the yoke untaught; Flagons of wine some for libation bear: The smoke of victims blacken'd all the air. As women wont, the female train select Their costly veils, with gay embroidery deck'd: Such golden toys, such trinkets they provide, As on a nuptial day adorn the bride. The comely chiefs their admiration won; But more than all Æager's tuneful son, As lightly to the lyre's melodious sound Tripp'd the brisk dancer o'er the measur'd ground. In concert full the virgin-choir prolong The happy day with Hymeneal song. Here a fair band, collected in a ring, Praises to thee, auspicious Juno, sing. By thee inspir'd, disclos'd the royal dame The friendly terms her prince was pleas'd to name. Nor are the terms Alcinoüs nam'd disown'd: (For now their faithful loves hath Hymen crown'd) True to his oath, he heard with fix'd disdain And deem'd Æeta's vengeful fury vain. Soon as the Colchians saw their purpose cross'd, Defeated all their schemes, their labour lost; That to the sovereign's terms they must accede, Or quit his ports, and sail away with speed; Dreading the monarch's wrath, submiss they try To win his friendship, and commence ally. Settling at last, long time the Colchian host Dwelt with the natives on Phœacia's coast: Till Bacchus' hated race from Corinth fled, Exil'd these Colchians, and the isle o'erspread. They sought the neighbouring shores: in times to come Their sons emigrating explor'd a home, Where far and wide extends th' Illyric coast, And the Ceraunian hills in clouds are lost. But these events, which now my Muse engage, Were late fulfill'd in some succeeding age. Yet still, in Phœbus' fane, uninjur'd stand The altars rais'd by fair Medea's hand: Some to the fates are pil'd with victims due, Some to the nymphs their annual rites renew. Towards the parting train the royal pair Their generous love by costly gifts declare. Twelve fair Phœacians, at the queen's command, Conduct Medea to the sea-beat strand. On the seventh morn with gently-breathing gales Propitious Jove expanded Argo's sails; Argo, decreed fresh dangers to sustain, Ere Greece beholds her gallant sons again. Ambracia's bay had open'd to their view, Beside Curetes' land the galley flew, The clustering isles, Echidanes, they pass'd, And Pelops' distant realm beheld at last. Nine tedious nights and days the vessel sweeps The troubled surface of the Libyan deeps; Till, driven by rapid tides and storms astray, She near the Syrtes' quicksands plough'd her way: Whirl'd in whose gulphy pools, their destin'd grave, Nor sails nor oars the sinking galleys save. Burst from its black abyss, the boiling flood Up-heaves its shaggy weeds, involv'd in shelves of mud. With the far-spreading spray the sands arise; But nought discern they here that creeps or flies. The tide (which now retreats into the main, And now returns upon the beach again;) Far o'er the shore, impell'd with fury, shew All Argo's slimy keel expos'd to view. They disembark, and gaze with aching eyes On ridgy mountains lost amid the skies. No grateful streams, no beaten paths appear, No rural cot discern they, far or near; A death-like silence reign'd around: dismay'd His comrade each interrogating said: ‘What country this? on what bleak clime at last ‘Have the rude tempests heaven-built Argo cast? ‘Oh! had we dar'd, devoid of vulgar fear, ‘Our course undaunted through those fragments steer, ‘Like heroes then (though Jove success deny'd) ‘We in the bold attempt had bravely died. ‘What can our skill devise? the least delay ‘Is fatal here; the winds forbid our stay. ‘How bleak and barren is the coast we tread! ‘And what a desert waste is wide around us spread! He said; and, joining in the loud lament, Ancæus thus foreboded the event: ‘What dire mishaps our gallant host befall! ‘Thus by stern fate's decree we perish all! ‘What woes await us, on this desert cast, ‘If from the land awakes the furious blast! ‘For slimy seas my sight far off commands, ‘And whitening billows bursting o'er the sands. ‘And dreadfully had Argo's yawning sides, ‘Remote from shore, receiv'd the gushing tides, ‘Had not the surge, which lifted her to heav'n, ‘Full on the pebbly beach the vessel driv'n. ‘But now the tide retiring quits the strand, ‘And waves unfaithful skim the levell'd sand. ‘Our projects baffled, and hope's cheerly dawn ‘From our expecting sight thus soon withdrawn, ‘Let other hands the pilot's art display, ‘And they who fear not danger steer the way. ‘But our joint labours Jove decrees to foil, ‘Nor will our native home reward our toil.’ He said; and all, renown'd for naval skill, Close with his words, and wait th' impending ill. From every heart the vital motion fled, O'er every face a deadly paleness spread. As when from street to street, in wild dismay, Affrighted mortals, like pale spectres, stray; Expecting wars, or plagues, or bursting rains, That deluge all the harvest of the plains: Or, as when statues drops of blood distil, And fancied bellowings the temples fill; The noon-day sun eclips'd involves in night Th' astonish'd world, and stars emit their light: Thus on the beach they stalk'd, a heartless clan! Like sweating statues, or like spectres wan. His feeble arm each round his comrade cast, Then sunk into the sand to breathe his last, Resolv'd, as now the star of Hesper rose, To share the solace of united woes. Some here, some there select their clay-cold bed, And round their shivering limbs their garments spread: Resign'd to death, in midnight's sullen shade And at mid-day, here languishing they laid. Remote, Medea's fair attendants moan, Cling round their queen, and groan return for groan. As when a nest, surcharg'd with callow young, Falls from the lofty cliff to which it clung, Th' unfeather'd brood by shrillest cries attest Their far-flown mother, and their ruin'd nest: As on the banks Pactolus' streams bedew, Melodious swans their dying notes renew; The rivers, gliding the rich vales among, Bear on their silver streams the soothing song: Thus they, their golden locks besmear'd with gore, All night in plaintive elegies deplore. Their toils yet incomplete, the godlike band Had now ignobly perish'd on the sand, But the bold heroines, who guard the coast, Beheld with pitying eye the drooping host: Those nymphs, who, when in glistering arms array'd, Rush'd from the Thunderer's brain the martial maid, In needful hour their kind assistance gave, And cleans'd her infant-limbs in Triton's wave. 'Twas noon: o'er Libya's sands the God of day Darted the splendours of his fiercest ray. Full before Jason stood the nymphs confess'd, And gently from his head withdrew the vest. Sudden he starts, impress'd with silent dread, And from his fair protectors turns his head. They in compassion's mild address began To free from terrours vain the hopeless man: ‘Why griev'st thou thus? Oh! bid thy sorrows cease: ‘We know thy coming's cause, the Golden Fleece. ‘We know the various toils by land you bore; ‘How toss'd on ocean, how distress'd on shore. ‘Terrestrial Powers, for acts of friendship known, ‘We make the shepherd's rural cares our own. ‘We, Libya's daughters and avengers, boast ‘Our sway extended o'er the Libyan coast. ‘Arise, nor sink beneath thy sorrow's weight; ‘But rouze thy fellows from their drooping state. ‘When Amphitrite with officious speed ‘Unreins from Neptune's car the fiery steed, ‘Thy mother then with duteous care repay, ‘Whose womb hath borne thee many a toilsome day. ‘Discharge this duty, and resail to Greece, ‘Safe and triumphant with the Golden Fleece.’ They spoke, and vanish'd: from his sandy bed Jason arose, and looking round he said; ‘Ye godlike Powers, the desert plains who rove, ‘Ye fair, who tend the flocks, propitious prove. ‘Those dark mysterious truths your tongues foretold, ‘I go, if haply can my friends unfold. ‘Conven'd, may they some prudent scheme devise, ‘For in th' advice of numbers safety lies.’ He said: and, wading thro' the driven sand, Rouz'd with loud voice the sad, desponding band. Thus, while the lion his lost mate explores, The forests ring, earth trembles as he roars: Herdsmen and herds, o'erwhelm'd with equal fear, All mute and trembling deem destruction near. But grateful to the host was Jason's call; No fears it cherish'd, but gave hope to all. Yet with dejected looks the heroes meet. Beside the female train to each his seat He, near the shore, assign'd; in order due His wondrous tale relates, and cheers the pensive crew: ‘Attend, my friends: three virgin-forms, who claim ‘From heaven their race, to sooth my sorrows came. ‘Their shoulders round were shaggy goat-skins cast, ‘Which, low descending, girt their slender waist. ‘High o'er my head they stood; with gentle hand ‘My vesture rais'd, and gave this dread command: ‘That I with speed my piteous bed forsake, ‘And, risen, haste my comrades to awake. ‘That mindful we our mother's cares repay, ‘Whose womb sustain'd us many a toilsome day, ‘When Amphitrite with officious speed ‘Unreins from Neptune's car the fiery steed. ‘Long have I sought this wonder to explain, ‘And, still revolving, I revolve in vain. ‘In the bold name of heroines they boast, ‘Daughters and guardians they of Libya's coast. ‘Known to these nymphs are all the toils we bore ‘On the rough ocean, and the faithless shore. ‘Nor staid they long; but, sudden, from my view ‘Their radiant forms an ambient cloud withdrew.’ He said: on every face sat boding fears; When, lo! a portent, greater far, appears. Fierce from the foamy deep, of wondrous size, Springs an huge horse; his mane expanded flies. From his strong sides he shakes th' adherent spray, Then towards the coast directs his rapid way. Skill'd in whate'er this prodigy portends, With pleasure Peleus thus consoles his friends: ‘Now by his consort's hand releas'd I see ‘The car of Neptune, and his horses free. ‘A mother's name (or I predict in vain) ‘Argo may boast; she feels a mother's pain. ‘Her pregnant womb a troop of heroes bears, ‘And endless perils for their safety shares. ‘Come, let us now our boasted strength display, ‘And on our shoulders bear our ship away. ‘Steer we through depths of sand our dangerous course, ‘Led by the steps of this portentous horse. ‘His steps reluctant press the dusty plain, ‘But rapid bear him to his kindred main; ‘Thither attend his flight.’ Thus spoke the seer: His pleasing counsels gratified their ear. This wondrous tale the tuneful Nine recite, And as the Muses dictate must I write. This have I heard, and this as truth proclaim, That you, O princely peers, of deathless fame, By the joint efforts of united hands, Twelve days and nights, through Libya's burning sands, High on your shoulders rais'd the vessel's weight, All that its womb contain'd, a mighty freight! What woes o'ertook them, and what toils befell, No verse can celebrate, no tongue can tell. Such brave exploits proclaim'd their godlike line, For, as their lineage, were their deeds, divine. But when Tritonis' lake the chiefs attain, They eas'd their shoulders, and embark'd again. Doom'd to acuter griefs they now are curs'd With all the miseries of burning thirst; Like dogs they run its fury to assuage, And at a fountain's head suppress its rage. Nor wander'd they in vain; but soon explor'd The sacred spot with golden apples stor'd, In Atlas' realm: the serpent's wakeful eyes Watch'd, till but yesterday, the golden prize. The fair Hesperides with kind survey Tended the serpent as they tun'd their lay. But, lo! the monster, by Alcides slain, Beneath a branching pear-tree press'd the plain. His tail still vibrates, though his ghastly head And spine immense lie motionless and dead. Flies in thick swarms his gory sides surround, Drink his black blood, and dry the dripping wound, Made by the darts, whose poison'd tips detain The deadly venom of the Hydra slain. As Ladon's fate the pensive maids deplore, Their hands they wrung, their golden locks they tore; But, sudden, as the heroes hasten'd near, They to the dust descend, and disappear. Struck with the prodigy his eyes survey'd, Thus to the nymphs observant Orpheus pray'd: ‘Ye Goddesses, with blooming beauty bless'd, ‘Look with benevolence on men distress'd. ‘Whether ye grace the splendid courts of Jove, ‘Or on this humbler earth auspicious move; ‘Whether to flowery pastures ye repair, ‘And the lov'd name of shepherdesses bear; ‘Illustrious nymphs, from Ocean sprung, arise, ‘Bless with a recent view our longing eyes. ‘Bid from the thirsty soil a torrent burst, ‘Or open some hard rock to slake our thirst. ‘Should we again our tatter'd sails expand, ‘And greet at last the dear Achaian land, ‘Grateful we then these favours will repay, ‘And choicest offerings on your altars lay: ‘No Goddess, who frequents the courts of Jove, ‘Shall greater honour share, or greater love.’ Thus Orpheus pray'd, with feeble voice and low: The listening nymphs commiserate their woe. First tender grass they bade the soil disclose; Then high above it verdant branches rose. Erect and strong, the spreading boughs display'd Wide o'er the barren soil an ample shade. A poplar's trunk fair Hespera receives, And in a weeping willow Ægle grieves. But Erytheïs in an elm remains: Each in her tree her proper shape retains; Stupendous sight! first Ægle silence broke, And kindly thus the suppliant band bespoke: ‘Hither some lawless plunderer came of late, ‘Who will reverse the colour of your fate. ‘Yon beast he slew, for whom we sorrow now, ‘And tore the golden apples from their bough. ‘But yesterday the desperate giant came; ‘From his black eye-brows flash'd the livid flame: ‘A lion's shaggy skin, besmear'd with gore, ‘Wide o'er his shoulders spread, the monster wore. ‘On his stout staff his fearless step rely'd, ‘And by his deadly dart the serpent died. ‘He, like a sturdy traveller, stalk'd along, ‘Seeking some fount to cool his fiery tongue. ‘With eager haste he trod the dusty plain, ‘And still for water look'd, but look'd in vain. ‘To this tall rock, hard by Tritonis' lake, ‘Some God conducted him, his thirst to slake. ‘Struck by his heel, its deep foundations shook, ‘And from the yawning clefts a torrent broke. ‘Prone on the ground the limpid streams he swills, ‘And, groveling like a beast, his belly fills.’ Elated with the tale, they speed their course, To find, as Ægle told, the fountain's source. As when assembled ants with joint essay Strive in some chink their lifted grain to lay: Or as when flies some liquid sweet explore, They hang in clusters round the honied store; Like them the Mynians: such their numbers seem, And such their haste to gather round the stream. Conjecturing thus some grateful hero said, As from the rill refresh'd he rais'd his head: ‘Ye Gods! though absent, great Alcides gives ‘These limpid streams; by him each hero lives. ‘Come, haste we now the country to explore, ‘And the lost wanderer to our host restore.’ Instant to council rose th' associate band, Selecting heroes to explore the land. For nightly winds dispersing o'er the plains The light, loose sands, no step impress'd remains. Boreas' fleet sons, who wing their airy flight, Sagacious Lynceus bless'd with keenest sight, Euphemus swift of foot, and Cantheus speed: Him his brave spirit urg'd and heaven decreed To ask Alcides, on what fatal coast He left his comrade, Polyphemus lost. When this bold chief had rear'd on Mysian ground, And fenc'd with circling walls a city round, Wide o'er the country, Argo's fate to learn, He roam'd, with Argo anxious to return. Scarce had his feet Calybian frontiers press'd, Ere fate consign'd him to eternal rest. Along the beach, with stately poplars spread, They rear'd a tomb in honour of the dead. But Lynceus deems, that, o'er the distant lands His sight the long-lost Hercules commands. Thus sees the clown, or thinks he can descry The new moon breaking through a cloudy sky. Back to his comrades hastes the joyous chief, Precludes their further search, and gives their mind relief. Euphemus soon, and Boreas' sons, his friends, Whose search in empty expectation ends, Rejoin'd the host: but thee, brave Canthus, slain Stern fate foredoom'd to press the Libyan plain. To feast his comrades with the grateful prey, He forc'd through scatter'd flocks his desperate way. Sudden, his flock to guard, the shepherd flew, And with a rock's huge fragment Canthus slew. This sturdy villager, Caphaurus nam'd, His lofty lineage from Apollo claim'd, And Acacallis: conscious of his might, He fear'd no rival, nor declin'd the fight. Minos, her sire, to Libya's coast remov'd Fair Acacallis, by the God belov'd. To Phœbus here a hopeful son she gave, Amphithemis or Garamans the brave. Thy love, Amphithemis, Tritonis crown'd, And grac'd thy bed with Nasamon renown'd, And bold Caphaurus; whose decisive blow Transmitted Canthus to the shades below. The bloody deed divulg'd to all the host, Not long his conquest could Caphaurus boast. They to its sepulchre the corse convey, Weeping; and make the shepherd's flocks their prey. To Pluto's realms prophetic Mopsus fled, And join'd, on that sad day, the mighty dead. With fate's decrees must mortal man comply, And the wise seer, in spite of prescience, die. For, shelter'd from the fierce meridian ray, Beneath a sandy bank a serpent lay. Innoxious till incens'd, he ne'er annoy'd, But strove th' affrighted traveller to avoid. But all, whome'er the foodful earth contains, Who feel his darted venom in their veins, Nor long, nor distant deem the dreary road, That leads direct to Pluto's dark abode. His fangs infix'd when once the wretches feel, In vain would medicine's God attempt to heal. For when brave Perseus (this her godlike son His mother oftener nam'd Eurymedon) O'er Libya flew, the Gorgon's head to bring, Fresh-slain and dripping, to th' expecting king, From every drop, that dyed the soil with blood, A serpent sprung, and thus encreas'd the brood. The monster's spiry tail rash Mopsus press'd With his unheeding foot: his tortur'd breast Upward he turn'd, and writh'd his spires around, Then with his venom'd fang infix'd a deadly wound. Medea trembled and her female train: Fearless he bathes the wound, nor heeds the pain. But now, lost wretch! each sense is clos'd and dead, And o'er his sinking eyes death's gloomy shade is spread. Prone to the dust he falls: his cold remains Press with unwieldy weight the desert plains. His faithful friends, and Jason with the rest, Weep o'er the corse, with heart-felt grief impress'd. His flesh all putrid from the taint within, And hanging round him loose his flabby skin, The burning sun unable long to bear, His busy comrades, with officious care, Deep in the soil conceal their delving spade, And soon a decent sepulchre was made. Men, matrons, all, as round the grave they flock, Lamenting loud select the sacred lock: His corse the bright-arm'd heroes thrice surround, And raise in seemly form the hallow'd mound, Then hasten to their ship: the southern breeze Curl'd, as it blew, the surface of the seas. In sad suspense, still wishing to forsake, And cross with favouring gales Tritonis' lake, They loiter long, and waste the useful day In idle contest and in vain delay. A serpent thus, long scorch'd with summer's heat, Winds to some secret chink, his cool retreat. Enrag'd he hisses, rears his crest on high, And furious darts his fire-emitting eye, Till haply he the wish'd-for chink pervade, And in its cool recess secure a shade. Uncertain thus, the ship explor'd in vain The lake's wide mouth that open'd to the main. With pious care, as Orpheus gives command, They place Apollo's tripod on the strand; That those auspicious Powers the coast who guard, Pleas'd with th' oblation, may their toils reward. Clad like a youth, before them stood confess'd The mighty Triton: in his hands he press'd The gather'd soil; this amicable sign He to the heroes held, and spoke benign: ‘The hospitable pledge my hand extends, ‘The best I now can give, accept, my friends. ‘Would you o'er ocean's paths your course discern, ‘And learn the tracks, which strangers wish to learn, ‘Hear: from my sire, the monarch of the main, ‘I boast my science; o'er these seas I reign. ‘Perchance ev'n you, though distant far you came, ‘May recognise Eurypylus's name, ‘In Libya born.’ He said: Euphemus took The proffer'd soil, and thus responsive spoke, “If such thy knowledge, friendly chief, explain “Where Atthis lies, where rolls the Cretan main. “Reluctant sail'd we towards the Libyan coast, “By angry heaven and adverse tempests tost: “By land, with Argo o'er our shoulders cast, “We toil'd, and launch'd her in this lake at last. “Nor can we yet our certain course devise, “Where full in prospect Pelops' realms will rise.” He said: his hand out-stretching, Triton shew The lake's wide mouth, and sea expos'd to view. ‘Where the lake blackens, and its waters sleep, ‘Expect,’ he cries, ‘a passage to the deep. ‘Observe the cliffs high towering on each side, ‘And through the streight they form your vessel guide. ‘There, above Crete, where, mingling with the skies, ‘Yon ocean spreads, the land of Pelops lies. ‘When to the right th' expanded lake ye leave, ‘And the safe seas your mighty freight receive, ‘Still cautious coast along the winding strand, ‘Till you the cape's projecting sides command: ‘Your course, that cape once doubled, safe pursue, ‘Your ship uninjur'd, and undaunted you. ‘Thus gladden'd go; nor let your vigorous arms ‘Droop with fatigue, and shake with vain alarms.’ Heartening he spoke: the decks they re-ascend, And, rowing brisk, to cross the lake contend. The proffer'd tripod friendly Triton takes, And hides his head beneath the dimpling lakes. Thus with the costly prize the God withdrew, Instant invisible to mortal view. Inspir'd with joy, that some superior guest Had comfort given them, and with counsel bless'd, The choicest sheep they bade their leader slay, And to the Power benign due honours pay. He to the galley's poop with speed convey'd The choicest sheep, and, as he offer'd, pray'd: ‘Dread Deity, who late conspicuous stood ‘On the clear margin of this rolling flood, ‘Whether great Triton's name delight thine ear, ‘Triton, whom all the watery Gods revere; ‘Or ocean's daughters, as they sound thy fame, ‘Thee mighty Nereus, or thee Phorcuns name, ‘Be bounteous still: bid all our labours cease, ‘And reinstate us in our native Greece.’ Thus pray'd the chief, as on the poop he stood, And sunk the slaughter'd victim in the flood. His head above the billows Triton rear'd, And in his proper shape the God appear'd. As when, intent his fiery steed to train, The horseman leads him to the dusty plain, His floating mane firm twisted in his hand, He runs, yet holds him subject to command: Superb he paces, by his master led, Curvetting still, and tossing high his head. His bits, all white with gather'd foam around, Craunch'd by his restless jaw, aloud resound: Thus Triton's hands the vessel's head sustain, And safely guide her to the seas again. His every limb, down to his swelling loin, Proclaims his likeness to the Powers divine. Below his loin his tapering tail extends; Arch'd like a whale's on either side it bends. Two pointed fins, projecting from his side, Cleave, as he scuds along th' opposing tide. Acute and tapering, these indented thorns A semblance bear to Phœbe's budding horns. His arm conducts her, till, from danger free, She rides imbosom'd in the open sea. This prodigy the shouting warriours saw, Impress'd at once with gratitude and awe. Here shatter'd ships Argous' port receives, Here tokens of her voyage Argo leaves: To Triton here, high-towering o'er the strand, And here to Neptune stately altars stand. For here they linger'd out one useless day; But with fresh breezes sail'd, at morn, away. Far to the right they leave the desert land, And the stretch'd canvass to the winds expand. Gaining mid ocean with returning light, The doubled cape diminish'd from their sight. The zephyrs ceasing, rose the southern gale, And cheer'd the shouting heroes as they sail. The evening-star now lifts, as day-light fades,Lines 1933–1954, 1969–1978, and 1985–2000 have been translated by William Broome; omissions have been supplied by Fawkes. His golden circlet in the deepening shades; Stretch'd at his ease the weary labourer shares A sweet forgetfulness of human cares: At once in silence sleep the sinking gales, The mast they drop, and furl the flagging sails; All night, all day, they ply their bending oars Towards Carpathus, and reach the rocky shores; Thence Crete they view, emerging from the main, The queen of isles; but Crete they view in vain. There Tagus mountains hurls with all their woods; Whole seas roll back, and tossing swell in floods. Amaz'd the towering monster they survey, And trembling view the interdicted bay. His birth he drew from giants sprung from oak, Or the hard entrails of the stubborn rock: Fierce guard of Crete! who thrice each year explores The trembling isle, and strides from shores to shores, A form of living brass! one part beneath Alone he bears, a part to let in death, Where o'er the ankle swells the turgid vein, Soft to the stroke, and sensible of pain. Pining with want, and sunk in deep dismay, From Crete far distant had they sail'd away, But the fair sorceress their speed repress'd, And thus the crew disconsolate address'd: ‘Attend. This monster, ribb'd with brass around, ‘My art, I ween, will level to the ground. ‘Whate'er his name, his strength however great, ‘Still, not immortal, must he yield to fate. ‘But from the far-thrown fragments safe retreat, ‘Till prostrate fall the giant at my feet.’ She said: retiring at her sage command, They wait the movement of her magic hand. Wide o'er her face her purple veil she spread, And climb'd the lofty decks, by Jason led. And now her magic arts Medea tries; Bids the red Furies, dogs of Orcus, rise, That starting dreadful from th' infernal shade, Ride heaven in storms, and all that breathes invade. Thrice she applies the power of magic pray'r, Thrice, hellward bending, mutters charms in air; Then, turning towards the foe, bids mischief fly, And looks destruction, as she points her eye. Then spectres, rising from Tartarean bow'rs, Howl round in air, or grin along the shores. Father supreme! what fears my breast annoy, Since not disease alone can life destroy, Or wounds inflicted fate's decrees fulfil, But magic's secret arts have power to kill! For, by Medea's incantations plied, Enfeebled soon the brazen monster died. While rending up the earth in wrath he throws Rock after rock against th' aerial foes, Lo! frantic as he strides, a sudden wound Bursts the life-vein, and blood o'erspreads the ground. As from a furnace, in a burning flood Pours melting lead, so pours in streams his blood: And now he staggers, as the spirit flies, He faints, he sinks, he tumbles, and he dies. As some huge cedar on a mountain's brow, Pierc'd by the steel, expects a final blow, Awhile it totters with alternate sway, Till freshening breezes through the branches play; Then tumbling downward with a thundering sound, Headlong it falls, and spreads a length of ground: So, as the giant falls, the ocean roars, Outstretch'd he lies, and covers half the shores. Crete thus deliver'd from this baneful pest, The Mynians unmolested sunk to rest. Soon as Aurora's orient beams appear, A temple they to Cretan Pallas rear. With water stor'd, once more the busy train Embark, and lash the foamy brine again. Assiduous all with equal ardour glow Distant to leave Salmonis' lofty brow. As o'er the Cretan deep the galley flew, Around them night her sable mantle threw; Pernicious night, whose all-investing shade Nor stars, nor Phœbe's brighter rays pervade. Thick darkness, or from heaven, or hell profound, Spread, as it rose, its rueful shades around. Uncertain whether, on huge billows tost, Sublime they sail, or sink to Pluto's coast, Uncertain where the bursting wave may throw, They to the sea commit their weal or woe. Jason aloud, with lifted hands, address'd The God of day to succour the distress'd. The tears fast trickling down his sorrowing face, He vow'd with gifts the Delphic shrine to grace, He vow'd with choicest gifts, an ample store, To load Amyclæ, and Ortygia's shore. Attentive to his tears and meek request, Phœbus from heaven descends, and stands confess'd, Where, frowning hideous o'er the deeps below, The rocks of Melans lift their shaggy brow. Awhile on one of these he takes his stand, His golden bow high lifting in his hand; Assisted by whose far-reflected light, An isle of small extent attracts their sight, Amid the Sporades; against it stood Hippuris, circled by the rolling flood. Their anchors here they drop. Aurora's ray Glimmer'd, and sunk before the light of day. A temple here o'er-arch'd with woods they raise, And bid an altar to Apollo blaze, On whom the name Æglete they bestow; For here the God display'd his beamy bow. Here, since on Argo's crew all bright he shone, By the name Anaphe the isle is known. The scanty produce of this barren isle To Phœbus they on humble altars pile. Each fair Phæacian in Medea's train, Who oft had seen the fatted oxen slain In king Alcinoüs' court, in laughter joins At sight of water pour'd on burning pines. With well-dissembled wrath the chiefs reprove The laughing damsels, and the mirth they love. A wordy altercation soon began, And pleasant raillery through the circle ran. Hence, to Æglete, on this festive day, All who in Anaphe due honours pay, Maidens and men, a mix'd assembly, join In friendly contests and debates benign. The halsers now were loosen'd from their hold, And unrestrain'd in ocean Argo roll'd, When thus the dream of night, yet uneffac'd, Revering Maia's son, Euphemus trac'd. How, with close grasp the sacred clod compress'd, Stream'd with a milky current at his breast. And from this clod, though small, his wondering eyes Beheld a lovely, female form arise. Charm'd with the beauteous fair, he soon resign'd To nuptial joys his love-devoted mind, Lamenting still that he the maid should wed, Whom at his fostering breast with milk he fed. “Thy children's nurse am I,” (the fair began, Accosting mild the disconcerted man;) “But not thy daughter: I from Triton came; “(Triton and Libya my parents' name) “He fix'd near Anaphe my watery cell, “And bade me here with Nereus' daughters dwell. “But now I hasten towards the sun's bright ray, “And to thy race the choicest boon convey.” This dream recurring to his mind again, He told the leader of the gallant train, Who, long revolving, thus at length reveal'd Those mystic truths the Pythic shrine conceal'd: ‘Ye Gods! what glory waits thy valorous deeds, ‘What fame, Euphemus, to thy toil succeeds! ‘For, when in ocean's bed this earth you fling, ‘Thence (so the Gods ordain) an isle shall spring; ‘Here shall thy children's children late repose. ‘Triton this hospitable gift bestows: ‘He tore from Afric's coast the treasur'd soil; ‘To him, of all the Gods, ascribe the isle.’ Thus spoke he prescient, nor in vain divin'd: Euphemus heard him with attentive mind; Transported with the presage, forth he sprung, And the mysterious clod in ocean flung. Instant emerging from the refluent tides, Calliste's isle display'd its wave-wash'd sides, Nurse of Euphemus' race: in days of yore, They dwelt on Sintian Lemnos' sooty shore. Exil'd from Lemnos by Etrurian force, To Sparta's friendly walls they bent their course: Ejected thence, Theras, Autesion's heir, Bade him to fam'd Calliste's isle repair; His name it took: th' events we now display Were unaccomplish'd in Euphemus' day. Vast tracts of ocean pass'd, the joyous host Steer'd towards, and anchor'd on Ægina's coast. They here propose a trial of their skill; What chief can first the weighty bucket fill, And, ere his fellows intercept his way, First to the ship the watery store convey. For parching thirst, and winds that briskly blew, To the fleet course inclin'd the gallant crew. His bucket now, replenish'd at the springs, Each stout Thessalian on his shoulder brings; Intent the palm of conquest to obtain, He scours with speedy foot across the plain. Hail, happy race of heroes, and repay With tributary praise my tuneful lay! With pleasure still may distant times rehearse And added years on years exalt my verse! For here I fix the period of your woes, And with your glorious toils my numbers close. Your galley loosen'd from Ægina's shore, Waves discompos'd, and winds detain'd no more. Serene ye sail'd beside th' Achaian strand, Where Cecrops' towers the subject main command, Where opposite Eubœa Aulis lies, And where the Locrian cities lofty rise, Till Pagasæ her friendly port display'd, Where rode triumphant Argo safe embay'd. END OF THE ARGONAUTICS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RAPE OF HELEN; OR, The Origin of the Trojan War: A GREEK POEM, By COLUTHUS. Ye nymphs of Troy, for beauty fam'd, who trace From Xanthus' fertile streams your ancient race, Oft on whose sandy banks your tires are laid, And many a trinket which your hands have made, What time to Ida's hallow'd mount ye throng, To join the festive choir in dance and song; No longer on your favourite banks repose, But come, the judgment of the swain disclose. Say from what hills, to trackless deeps unknown, Rush'd with impetuous zeal the daring clown; Say to what end, with future ills replete, O'er distant oceans sail'd a mighty fleet; What seas could this adventurous youth embroil, Sow discord's seeds o'er what disastrous soil? Say from what source arose the dire debate, Which swains could end and Goddesses create. What his decision? Of the Grecian dame Who to the shepherd's ear convey'd the name? Speak, for ye saw, on Ida's still retreat, Judicial Paris fill his shepherd's seat; Venus ye saw, the Graces' darling queen, As on her judge approv'd she smil'd serene. What time Hæmonia's lofty mountains rung With hymeneal songs for Peleus sung, Officious Ganymede, at Jove's request, Supplied with sparkling wine each welcome guest; And all the Gods to Thetis' nuptials came, Sister of Amphitrite, honour'd dame. Earth-shaking Neptune left his azure main, And Jove supreme forsook his starry plain: From Helicon, with odorous shrubs o'erspread, The Muses' tuneful choir Apollo led. Him Juno follow'd, wife of sovereign Jove: With Harmony the smiling queen of Love Hasten'd to join the Gods in Chiron's festive grove. Cupid's full quiver o'er her shoulder thrown, Persuasion follow'd with a bridal crown. Minerva, though to nuptial rites a foe, Came; but no helmet nodded o'er her brow. Diana to the Centaur's grove resorts, And for one day forgets her rural sports. His loose locks shaking as the zephyrs play'd, Not long behind convivial Bacchus stay'd. War's God, as when to Vulcan's dome he sped, No spear his hand sustain'd, no casque his head, Such now, without his helmet or his lance, Smiling he look'd, and led the bridal dance. But from these blissful scenes was Discord warn'd; Peleus rejected her, and Chiron scorn'd. As by the gadfly stung, the heifer strays Far from its fields, through every devious maze; Thus, stung with envy, Discord roam'd, nor ceas'd Her baneful arts to interrupt the feast. Oft from her flinty bed she rush'd amain, Then stood, then sunk into her seat again: With desperate hand she tore her snaky head, And with a serpent-scourge she lash'd her flinty bed. To dart the forky lightning, and command From hell's abyss the Titans' impious band, Jove from his throne with rebel-arm to wrest, Were projects form'd within the fury's breast. But, though incens'd, she dreaded Vulcan's ire, Who forms Jove's bolt, and checks the raging fire. Her purpose changing, she with rattling arms Dissension meditates and dire alarms; If haply clattering shields can strike dismay, And from the nuptials drive the Gods away. But Mars she dreaded, oft in arms array'd, And this new project with complacence weigh'd. The burnish'd apples, rich with golden rind, Growth of Hesperian gardens, struck her mind. Resolv'd contention's baneful seeds to sow, She tore the blushing apple from its bough, Grasp'd the dire source whence future battles sprung, And midst the Gods the golden mischief flung. The stately wife of Jove with wondering eyes Beheld, and wish'd to grasp the golden prize. Beauty's fair queen to catch the apple strove; For 'tis the prize of beauty and of love. Jove mark'd the contest, and, to crush debate, Thus counsel'd Hermes, who beside him sat: ‘Paris, perchance, from Priam sprung, you know; ‘His herds he grazes on mount Ida's brow, ‘And oft conducts them to the dewy meads, ‘Through which his streams the Phrygian Xanthus leads: ‘Shew him yon prize, and urge him to declare ‘Which of these Goddesses he deems most fair; ‘In whom, of all, his matchless skill can trace ‘The close-arch'd eyebrow and the roundest face, ‘On such a face, where bends the circling bow, ‘The golden apple, beauty's prize, bestow.’ Thus spoke the sire: the willing son obey'd, And to their judge the Deities convey'd. Each anxious fair her charms to heighten tries, And dart new lustre from her sparkling eyes. Her veil aside insidious Venus flung; Loose from the clasp her fragrant ringlets hung; She then in golden cauls each curl compress'd, Summon'd her little Loves, and thus address'd: ‘Behold, my sons, the hour of trial near! ‘Embrace, my Loves, and bid me banish fear. ‘This day's decision will enhance my fame, ‘Crown beauty's queen, or sink in endless shame. ‘Doubting I stand, to whom the swain may say, ‘Bear thou, most fair, the golden prize away. ‘Nurs'd was each Grace by Juno's fostering hand; ‘And crowns and sceptres shift at her command. ‘Minerva dictates in th' embattled field; ‘And heroes tremble when she shakes her shield. ‘Of all the Goddesses that rule above, ‘Far most defenceless is the queen of Love. ‘Without or spear or shield must Venus live; ‘And crowns and sceptres she has none to give. ‘Yet why despair? though with no falchion grac'd, ‘Love's silken chain surrounds my slender waist. ‘My bow this Cestus, this the dart I fling, ‘And with this Cestus I infix my sting. ‘My sting infix'd renews the lover's pain, ‘And virgins languish, but revive again.’ Thus to her Loves the rosy-finger'd queen Told all her fears, and vented all her spleen: To every word they lent a willing ear, Round their fond mother clung, and strove to cheer. And now they reach mount Ida's grassy steep, Where youthful Paris feeds his father's sheep: What time he tends them in the plains below, Through which the waters of Anaurus flow, Apart he counts his cattle's numerous stock, Apart he numbers all his fleecy flock. A wild goat's skin, around his shoulders cast, Loose fell and flow'd below his girded waist. A pastoral staff, which swains delight to hold, His roving herds protected and controll'd. Accoutred thus, and warbling o'er his song, He to his pipe melodious pac'd along. Unnoted oft, while he renews his lay, His flocks desert him, and his oxen stray. Swift to his bower retires the tuneful man, To pipe the praise of Hermes and of Pan. Sunk is each animal in dead repose; No dog around him barks, no heifer lows: Echo alone rebounds through Ida's hills, And all the air with sounds imperfect fills. The cattle, slunk upon their verdant bed, Close by their piping lord repose their head. Beneath the shades which sheltering thickets blend, When Paris' eye approaching Hermes ken'd, Back he retires, with sudden fear impress'd, And shuns the presence of the heavenly guest: To the thick shrubs his tuneful reed conveys, And all unfinish'd leaves his warbled lays. Thus winged Hermes to the shepherd said, Who mark'd the God's approach with silent dread: ‘Dismiss thy fears, nor with thy flocks abide; ‘A mighty contest Paris must decide. ‘Haste, judge announc'd; for whose decision wait ‘Three lovely females, of celestial state. ‘Haste, and the triumph of that face declare, ‘Which sweetest looks, and fairest midst the fair: ‘Let her, whose form thy critic eye prefers, ‘Claim beauty's prize, and be this apple hers.’ Thus Hermes spoke; the ready swain obey'd, And to decide the mighty cause essay'd. With keenest look he mark'd the heavenly dames; Their eyes, quick flashing as the lightning's flames, Their snowy necks, their garments fring'd with gold, And rich embroidery wrought in every fold; Their gait he mark'd, as gracefully they mov'd, And round their feet his eye sagacious rov'd. But, ere the smiling swain his thoughts express'd, Grasping his hand him Pallas thus address'd: ‘Regard not, Phrygian youth, the wife of Jove, ‘Nor Venus heed, the queen of wedded love: ‘But martial prowess if thy wisdom prize, ‘Know, I possess it; praise me to the skies. ‘Thee, fame reports, puissant states obey, ‘And Troy's proud city owns thy sovereign sway. ‘Her suffering sons thy conquering arm shall shield, ‘And stern Bellona shall to Paris yield. ‘Comply; her succour will Minerva lend, ‘Teach thee war's science, and in fight defend.’ Thus Pallas strove to influence the swain, Whose favour Juno thus attempts to gain: ‘Should'st thou with beauty's prize my charms reward, ‘All Asia's realms shall own thee for their lord. ‘Say, what from battles but contention springs? ‘Such contests shun; for what are wars to kings? ‘But him, whose hands the rod of empire sway, ‘Cowards revere, and conquerors obey. ‘Minerva's friends are oft Bellona's slaves, ‘And the fiend slaughters whom the Goddess saves.’ Proffers of boundless sway thus Juno made; And Venus thus, contemptuous smiling, said: But first her floating veil aloft she threw, And all her graces to the shepherd shew; Loosen'd her little Loves' attractive chain, And tried each art to captivate the swain. ‘Accept my boon,’ (thus spoke the smiling dame) ‘Battles forget, and dread Bellona's name. ‘Beauty's rich meed at Venus' hand receive, ‘And Asia's wide domain to tyrants leave. ‘The deathful fight, the din of arms I fear; ‘Can Venus' hand direct the martial spear? ‘Women with beauty stoutest hearts assail, ‘Beauty, their best defence, their strongest mail. ‘Prefer domestic ease to martial strife, ‘And to exploits of war a pleasing wife. ‘To realms extensive Helen's bed prefer, ‘And scoff at kingdoms, when oppos'd to her. ‘Thy prize with envy Sparta shall survey, ‘And Troy to Paris tune the bridal lay.’ The shepherd, who astonish'd stood and mute, Consign'd to Venus the Hesperian fruit, The claim of beauty, and the source of woes; For dire debates from this decision rose. Uplifting in her hand the glowing prize, She rallied thus the vanquish'd Deities: ‘To me, ye martial dames, the prize resign; ‘Beauty I court, and beauty's prize is mine. ‘Mother of mighty Mars and Vulcan too, ‘Fame says, the choir of Graces sprung from you: ‘Yet distant far, this day, your daughters stray'd, ‘And no one Grace appear'd to lend you aid. ‘Mars too declin'd t' assert his mother's right, ‘Though oft his brandish'd sword decides the fight. ‘His boasted flames why could not Vulcan cast, ‘And at one blaze his mother's rivals blast? ‘Vain are thy triumphs, Pallas, vain thy scorn; ‘Thou, not in wedlock, nor of woman born. ‘Jove's teeming head the monstrous birth contains, ‘And the barb'd iron ripp'd thee from his brains. ‘Brac'd with th' unyielding plaits of ruthless mail, ‘She curses Cupid and the silken veil. ‘Connubial bliss and concord she abhors, ‘In discord glories and delights in wars. ‘Yet know, virago, not in feats of arms ‘Triumph weak women, but in beauty's charms. ‘Nor men nor women are those mungrels base, ‘Like you, equivocal in form and face.’ In terms like these the laughter-loving queen Rallied her rivals, and increas'd their spleen, As, lifting high, she view'd with secret joy Her beauty's triumphs and the bane of Troy. Inspir'd with love for her, the fair unknown, By beauty's conquering queen pronounc'd his own, Ill-fated Paris to the forest's maze Men vers'd in Pallas' various arts conveys. At Pericles' command they give the blow, And lay the glories of the forest low. He, artist fam'd, his frantic prince obey'd, And burden'd ocean with the ships he made. From Ida's summits rush'd the daring swain, And to its bowery shades prefer'd the boisterous main. Th' extended beach with choice oblations stor'd, And his protectress Venus oft implor'd; The billowy deep his furrowing keel divides, And in the Hellespont his vessel rides. But prodigies announce approaching ill, And with presages sad each bosom fill. Up-heaving waves heaven's starry concave shroud, And round each Bear is cast a circling cloud. Clouds and big waves discharge their watery stores; Full on the deck the bursting torrent pours. Their sturdy oars with unabating sweep Far whitening agitate the angry deep. Dardanus pass'd, and Ilion's fertile plains, The mouth of Ismarus' lake the adventurer gains. Now, far remote, they view Pangræa's height; Now Phillis' rising tomb attracts their sight, And the dull round she nine times trode in vain, To view the faithless wanderer again. Hæmonia's meads remote, the Trojan spies Th' Achaian cities unexpected rise: Phthia, with heroes far-renown'd replete; Mycenæ, fam'd for many a spacious street. Beside the meads, where Erymanthus glides, Sparta aspires, that boasts her beauteous brides; Sparta with joy th' expecting swain survey'd, Lav'd by Eurotas, by Atrides sway'd. Nor distant far, o'ershaded by a wood, Beneath a mountain's brow Therapnæ stood. Short was their voyage now: the bending oar Was heard to lash the foamy surge no more. The sailors, safe imbosom'd in the bay, Firm to the beach confine the corded stay. In purifying waters plung'd the swain, And, rising thence, pac'd slowly o'er the plain. For much he fear'd, lest his incautious tread O'er his wash'd feet the spatter'd mire should spread; Or lest his hair, beneath his casque confin'd, Should, if he ran, be ruffled with the wind. The city's splendor Paris' eye detains, The citizens' abodes, and glistering fanes: Here Pallas' form, in mimic gold portray'd, Here Hyacinthus' image he survey'd. Him with delight the Amiclæans view'd, Pursuing Phœbus and by him pursu'd; But, sore displeas'd at jealous Zephyr's spite, They urg'd the stripling to unequal fight; For Phœbus' efforts ineffectual prov'd, To save from Zephyr's rage the youth he lov'd. Earth with compassion heard Apollo's cries, And from her bosom bade a flower arise, His favourite's name, impress'd upon whose leaf, Still, as the God contemplates, sooths his grief. Now Priam's son before Atrides' dome Exulting stood in beauty's purple bloom. Not Semele, by Jove's caresses won, On Jove bestow'd so beautiful a son: (Forgive me, Bacchus, seed of Jove supreme) Such peerless graces round his person beam. Touch'd by fair Helen's hand the bolts recede; She to the spacious hall repair'd with speed: Her form distinct th' unfolded portals shew; She look'd, she ponder'd, and again withdrew. Then on a radiant seat she bade him rest, And, still insatiate, gaz'd upon her guest. Awhile she likens him in graceful mien To Love, attendant on the Cyprian queen. But 'tis not Love, she recollects again; Nor bow nor quiver deck this gallant swain. 'Tis Bacchus sure, the God of wine, she said; For o'er his cheeks a rosy bloom is spread, Daring at length her faltering voice to raise, She thus express'd her wonder and her praise: ‘Whence art thou, stranger? whence thy comely race? ‘Thy country tell me, and thy natal place. ‘In thee I mark the majesty of kings: ‘But not from Greece thy lofty lineage springs. ‘Not sandy Pyle thine origin can shew; ‘I know not thee, though Nestor's son I know. ‘Phthia, the nurse of heroes, train'd not thee; ‘For known are all th' Æacidæ to me. ‘Peleus, and Telamon renown'd in fight, ‘Patroclus' courtesy, Achilles' might.’ Inspir'd by love, thus spoke the gentle dame; And he, thus answering, fann'd the rising flame: “If e'er recording fame, illustrious maid, “Hath to thine ear great Ilion's name convey'd, “Ilion, whose walls on Phrygian frontiers stand, “Rear'd by Apollo's and by Neptune's hand; “Him if thou know'st, most opulent of kings, “Who reigns o'er Ilion, and from Saturn springs; “I to hereditary worth aspire; “The wealthy Priam is my honour'd sire. “My high descent from Dardanus I prove; “And ancient Dardanus descends from Jove. “Th' Immortals thus forsake the realms of light, “And mix with mortals in the social rite. “Neptune and Phœbus thus forsook the sphere, “Firm on its base my native Troy to rear. “But know, on three fair Goddesses, of late, “Sentence I pass'd, and clos'd the long debate. “On Venus, who with charms superior shone, “I lavish'd praises and conferr'd my boon. “The Cyprian Goddess, pleas'd with my decree, “Reserv'd this recompence, O queen, for me; “Some faithful fair, possess'd of heavenly charms, “Should, she protested, bless my longing arms; “Helen her name, to beauty's queen ally'd; “Helen, for thee I stemm'd the troubled tide. “Unite we now in Hymen's mystic bands; “Thus love inspires, and Venus thus commands. “Scorn not my suit, nor beauty's queen despise: “More need I add to influence the wise? “For well thou know'st, how dastardly and base “Is Menelaus's degenerate race. “And well I know, that Græcia's ample coast “No fair like thee, for beauty fam'd, can boast.” He said; on earth her sparkling eyes she cast, Embarrass'd paus'd awhile, and spoke at last: ‘To visit Ilion, and her towers survey, ‘Rear'd by the God of ocean and of day, ‘(Stupendous labours by Celestials wrought) ‘Hath oft, illustrious guest, employ'd my thought. ‘Oft have I wish'd to saunter o'er the vales, ‘Whose flowery pasture Phœbus' flocks regales; ‘Where, beneath Ilion's walls, along the meads, ‘The shepherd-God his lowing oxen feeds. ‘To Ilion I'll attend thee: haste, away; ‘For beauty's queen forbids our long delay. ‘No husband's threats, no husband's search I dread, ‘Though he to Troy suspect his Helen fled. The Spartan dame, of matchless charms possess'd, Proffer'd these terms to her consenting guest. Night, which relieves our toils, when the bright sun, In ocean sunk, his daily course has run, Now gives her softest slumbers, ere the ray Of rising morn proclaims th' approach of day. Two gates of airy dreams she opens wide; Of polish'd horn is this, where truths abide: Voices divine through this mysterious gate Proclaim th' unalterable will of fate. But through the ivory-gate incessant troop Of vain, delusive dreams a faithless group. Helen, seduc'd from Menelaus' bed, Th' adventurous shepherd to his navy led; To Troy with speed he bears the fatal freight; For Venus' proffers confidence create. At morning's dawn Hermione appears, With tresses discompos'd and bath'd in tears, She rous'd her menial train; and thus express'd The boding sorrows of her troubled breast: ‘Where, fair attendants, is my mother fled, ‘Who left me sleeping in her lonely bed? ‘For yesternight she took her trusty key, ‘Turn'd the strong bolt, and slept secure with me.’ Her hapless fate the pensive train deplore, And in thick circles gather round the door; Here all contend to moderate her grief, And by their kind condolence give relief: ‘Unhappy princess, check the rising tear; ‘Thy mother, absent now, will soon appear. ‘Soon as thy sorrow's bitter source she knows, ‘Her speedy presence will dispel thy woes. ‘The virgin-cheek, with sorrow's weight o'ercome, ‘Sinks languid down and loses half its bloom. ‘Deep in the head the tearful eye retires, ‘There sullen sits, nor darts its wonted fires. ‘Eager, perchance, the band of nymphs to meet, ‘She saunters devious from her favourite-seat, ‘And, of some flowery mead at length possess'd, ‘Sinks on the dew-bespangled lawn to rest. ‘Or to some kindred stream perchance she strays, ‘Bathes in Eurotas' streams, and round its margin plays.’ ‘Why talk ye thus?’ (the pensive maid replies, The tears of anguish trickling from her eyes) ‘She knows each roseate bower, each vale and hill, ‘She knows the course of every winding rill. ‘The stars are set; on rugged rocks she lies: ‘The stars are up; nor does my mother rise. ‘What hills, what dales thy devious steps detain? ‘Hath some relentless beast my mother slain? ‘But beasts, which lawless round the forest rove, ‘Revere the sacred progeny of Jove. ‘Or art thou fallen from some steep mountain's brow, ‘Thy corse conceal'd in dreary dells below? ‘But through the groves, with thickest foliage crown'd, ‘Beneath each shrivel'd leaf that strews the ground, ‘Assiduous have I sought thy corse in vain: ‘Why should we then the guiltless grove arraign? ‘But have Eurotas' streams, which rapid flow, ‘O'erwhelm'd thee bathing in its deeps below? ‘Yet in the deeps below the Naiads live, ‘And they to womankind protection give.’ Thus spoke the sorrowing, and reclin'd her head; And sleeping seem'd to mingle with the dead. For sleep his elder brother's aspect wears; Lies mute like him, and undisturb'd by cares. Hence the swoln eyes of females, deep distress'd, Oft, when the tear is trickling, sink to rest. In this delusive dream the sleeping maid Her mother saw, or thought she saw, portray'd. Aloud she shriek'd, distracted and amaz'd, And utter'd thus her anguish as she gaz'd: ‘Last night, far distant from your daughter fled, ‘You left me slumbering in my father's bed. ‘What dangerous steeps have not I strove to gain? ‘And stroll'd o'er hills and dales for thee in vain?’ “Condemn me not; (replied the wandering dame) “Pity my sufferings, nor augment my shame. “Me yesterday a lawless guest beguil'd, “And distant tore me from my darling child. “At Cytherea's high command I rove; “And once more revel in the walks of love.” She said: her voice the sleeping maid alarms; She springs to clasp her mother in her arms. In vain: no mother meets her wistful eyes; And now her tears redouble and her cries: ‘Ye feathery race, inhabitants of light, ‘To Crete's fam'd isle direct your rapid flight. ‘There to my sire th' unwelcome truth proclaim, ‘How yesterday a desperate vagrant came, ‘Tore all he dotes on from his bridal bed, ‘And with his beauteous queen abruptly fled.’ The restless fair, her mother to regain, Thus to the winds bewail'd and wept in vain. The Thracian town diminish'd from their view, And fleet o'er Helle's strait the vessel flew. The bridegroom now his natal coast descry'd, And to the Trojan port conducts his bride. Cassandra from her tower beheld them sail, And tore her locks, and rent her golden veil. But hospitable Troy unbars her gate, Receives her citizen and seals her fate. THE END.</field>
