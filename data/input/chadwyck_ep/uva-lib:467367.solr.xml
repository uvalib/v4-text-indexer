      <field name="fulltext">[If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven] If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven, Then, to the measure of that heaven-born light, Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content:â The stars pre-eminent in magnitude, And they that from the zenith dart their beams, (Visible though they be to half the earth, Though half a sphere be conscious of their brightness) Are yet of no diviner origin, No purer essence, than the one that burns, Like an untended watch-fire, on the ridge Of some dark mountain; or than those which seem Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps, Among the branches of the leafless trees; All are the undying offspring of one Sire: Then, to the measure of the light vouchsafed, Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content. SUPPLEMENT OF PIECES NOT APPEARING IN THE EDITION OF 1849â50; ARRANGED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. I. LINES WRITTEN AS A SCHOOL EXERCISE AT HAWKSHEAD, ANNO ÃTATIS 14. âAnd has the Sun his flaming chariot driven Two hundred times around the ring of heaven, Since Science first, with all her sacred train, Beneath yon roof began her heavenly reign? While thus I mused, methought, before mine eyes, The Power of Education seemed to rise; Not she whose rigid precepts trained the boy Dead to the sense of every finer joy; Nor that vile wretch who bade the tender age Spurn Reason's law and humour Passion's rage; But she who trains the generous British youth In the bright paths of fair majestic Truth: Emerging slow from Academus' grove In heavenly majesty she seem'd to move. Stern was her forehead, but a smile serene âSoften'd the terrors of her awful mien.â Close at her side were all the powers, design'd To curb, exalt, reform the tender mind: With panting breast, now pale as winter snows, Now flush'd as Hebe, Emulation rose; Shame follow'd after with reverted eye, And hue far deeper than the Tyrian dye; Last Industry appear'd with steady pace, A smile sat beaming on her pensive face. I gazed upon the visionary train, Threw back my eyes, return'd, and gazed again. When lo! the heavenly goddess thus began, Through all my frame the pleasing accents ran. ââWhen Superstition left the golden light And fled indignant to the shades of night; When pure Religion rear'd the peaceful breast And lull'd the warring passions into rest, Drove far away the savage thoughts that roll In the dark mansions of the bigot's soul, Enlivening Hope display'd her cheerful ray, And beam'd on Britain's sons a brighter day; So when on Ocean's face the storm subsides, Hush'd are the winds and silent are the tides; The God of day, in all the pomp of light, Moves through the vault of heaven, and dissipates the night; Wide o'er the main a trembling lustre plays, The glittering waves reflect the dazzling blaze; Science with joy saw Superstition fly Before the lustre of Religion's eye; With rapture she beheld Britannia smile, Clapp'd her strong wings, and sought the cheerful isle, The shades of night no more the soul involve, She sheds her beam, and, lo! the shades dissolve; No jarring monks, to gloomy cell confined, With mazy rules perplex the weary mind; No shadowy forms entice the soul aside, Secure she walks, Philosophy her guide. Britain, who long her warriors had adored, And deem'd all merit centred in the sword; Britain, who thought to stain the field was fame, Now honour'd Edward's less than Bacon's name. Her sons no more in listed fields advance To ride the ring, or toss the beamy lance; No longer steel their indurated hearts To the mild influence of the finer arts; Quick to the secret grotto they retire To court majestic truth, or wake the golden lyre; By generous Emulation taught to rise, The seats of learning brave the distant skies. Then noble Sandys, inspir'd with great design, Reared Hawkshead's happy roof, and call'd it mine. There have I loved to show the tender age The golden precepts of the classic page; To lead the mind to those Elysian plains Where, throned in gold, immortal Science reigns; Fair to the view is sacred Truth display'd, In all the majesty of light array'd, To teach, on rapid wings, the curious soul To roam from heaven to heaven, from pole to pole, From thence to search the mystic cause of things And follow Nature to her secret springs; Nor less to guide the fluctuating youth Firm in the sacred paths of moral truth, To regulate the mind's disordered frame, And quench the passions kindling into flame; The glimmering fires of Virtue to enlarge, And purge from Vice's dross my tender charge. Oft have I said, the paths of Fame pursue, And all that Virtue dictates, dare to do; Go to the world, peruse the book of man, And learn from thence thy own defects to scan; Severely honest, break no plighted trust, But coldly rest not hereâbe more than just; Join to the rigours of the sires of Rome The gentler manners of the private dome; When Virtue weeps in agony of woe, Teach from the heart the tender tear to flow; If Pleasure's soothing song thy soul entice, Or all the gaudy pomp of splendid Vice, Arise superior to the Siren's power, The wretch, the short-lived vision of an hour; Soon fades her cheek, her blushing beauties fly, As fades the chequer'd bow that paints the sky. ââSo shall thy sire, whilst hope his breast inspires, And wakes anew life's glimmering trembling fires, Hear Britain's sons rehearse thy praise with joy, Look up to heaven, and bless his darling boy. If e'er these precepts quell'd the passions' strife, If e'er they smooth'd the rugged walks of life, If e'er they pointed forth the blissful way That guides the spirit to eternal day, Do thou, if gratitude inspire thy breast, Spurn the soft fetters of lethargic rest. Awake, awake! and snatch the slumbering lyre, Let this bright morn and Sandys the song inspire.â âI look'd obedience: the celestial Fair Smiled like the morn, and vanish'd into air.â II. SONNET, ON SEEING MISS HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS WEEP AT A TALE OF DISTRESS. She wept.âLife's purple tide began to flow In languid streams through every thrilling vein; Dim were my swimming eyesâmy pulse beat slow, And my full heart was swell'd to dear delicious pain. Life left my loaded heart, and closing eye; A sigh recall'd the wanderer to my breast; Dear was the pause of life, and dear the sigh That call'd the wanderer home, and home to rest. That tear proclaimsâin thee each virtue dwells, And bright will shine in misery's midnight hour; As the soft star of dewy evening tells What radiant fires were drown'd by day's malignant pow'r, That only wait the darkness of the night To cheer the wand'ring wretch with hospitable light. AXIOLOGUS. III. THE BIRTH OF LOVE. When Love was born of heavenly line, What dire intrigues disturbed Cythera's joy! Till Venus cried, âA mother's heart is mine; None but myself shall nurse my boy.â But, infant as he was, the child In that divine embrace enchanted lay; And, by the beauty of the vase beguil'd, Forgot the beverageâand pin'd away. âAnd must my offspring languish in my sight?â (Alive to all a mother's pain, The Queen of Beauty thus her court address'd) âNo: Let the most discreet of all my train Receive him to her breast: Think all, he is the God of young delight.â Then Tenderness with Candour join'd, And Gaiety the charming office sought; Nor even Delicacy stayed behind: But none of those fair Graces brought Wherewith to nurse the childâand still he pin'd. Some fond hearts to Compliance seem'd inclin'd; But she had surely spoil'd the boy: And sad experience forbade a thought On the wild Goddess of Voluptuous Joy. Long undecided lay th'important choice, Till of the beauteous court, at length, a voice Pronounced the name of Hope:âThe conscious child Stretched forth his little arms and smil'd. 'Tis said Enjoyment (who averr'd The charge belong'd to her alone) Jealous that Hope had been preferr'd Laid snares to make the babe her own. Of Innocence the garb she took, The blushing mien and downcast look; And came her services to proffer: And Hope (what has not Hope believ'd!) By that seducing air deceiv'd, Accepted of the offer. It happen'd that, to sleep inclin'd, Deluded Hope for one short hour To that false Innocence's power Her little charge consign'd. The Goddess then her lap with sweetmeats fill'd And gave, in handfuls gave, the treacherous store: A wild delirium first the infant thrill'd; But soon upon her breast he sunkâto wake no more. IV. THE CONVICT. The glory of evening was spread through the west; âOn the slope of a mountain I stood, While the joy that precedes the calm season of rest Rang loud through the meadow and wood. âAnd must we then part from a dwelling so fair?â In the pain of my spirit I said, And with a deep sadness I turned, to repair To the cell where the convict is laid. The thick-ribbÃ¨d walls that o'ershadow the gate Resound; and the dungeons unfold: I pause; and at length, through the glimmering grate, That outcast of pity behold. His black matted hair on his shoulder is bent, And deep is the sigh of his breath, And with steadfast dejection his eyes are intent On the fetters that link him to death. 'Tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze, That body dismiss'd from his care; Yet my fancy has pierced to his heart, and pourtrays More terrible images there. His bones are consumed, and his life-blood is dried, With wishes the past to undo; And his crime, through the pains that o'erwhelm him, descried, Still blackens and grows on his view. When from the dark synod, or blood-reeking field, To his chamber the monarch is led, All soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield, And quietness pillow his head. But if grief, self-consumed, in oblivion would doze, And conscience her tortures appease, 'Mid tumult and uproar this man must repose; In the comfortless vault of disease. When his fetters at night have so press'd on his limbs, That the weight can no longer be borne, If, while a half-slumber his memory bedims, The wretch on his pallet should turn, While the jail-mastiff howls at the dull clanking chain, From the roots of his hair there shall start A thousand sharp punctures of cold-sweating pain, And terror shall leap at his heart. But now he half-raises his deep-sunken eye, And the motion unsettles a tear; The silence of sorrow it seems to supply, And asks of me why I am here. âPoor victim! no idle intruder has stood With o'erweening complacence our state to compare, But one, whose first wish is the wish to be good, Is come as a brother thy sorrows to share. âAt thy name though compassion her nature resign, Though in virtue's proud mouth thy report be a stain, My care, if the arm of the mighty were mine, Would plant thee where yet thou might'st blossom again.â V. ANDREW JONES. I hate that Andrew Jones: he'll breed His children up to waste and pillage. I wish the press-gang or the drum Would, with its rattling music, come, And sweep him from the village! I said not this, because he loves Through the long day to swear and tipple; But for the poor dear sake of one To whom a foul deed he had done, A friendless Man, a travelling Cripple! For this poor crawling helpless wretch Some Horseman who was passing by, A penny on the ground had thrown; But the poor Cripple was alone And could not stoopâno help was nigh. Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground For it had long been droughty weather; So with his staff the Cripple wrought Among the dust till he had brought The halfpennies together. It chanc'd that Andrew pass'd that way Just at the time; and there he found The Cripple in the mid-day heat Standing alone, and at his feet He saw the penny on the ground. He stooped and took the penny up: And when the Cripple nearer drew, Quoth Andrew, âUnder half-a-crown, What a man finds is all his own, And so, my Friend, good-day to you.â And hence I say, that Andrew's boys Will all be train'd to waste and pillage; And wish'd the press-gang, or the drum Would, with its rattling music, come, And sweep him from the village! VI. âON NATURE'S INVITATION DO I COME.â On Nature's invitation do I come, By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead, That made the calmest, fairest spot on earth, With all its unappropriated good, My own; and not mine only, for with me Entrenchedâsay rather peacefully emboweredâ Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot, A younger orphan of a Home extinct, The only daughter of my parents dwells: Aye, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir; Pause upon that, and let the breathing frame No longer breathe, but all be satisfied. Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then Shall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne'er Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts, But either she, whom now I have, who now Divides with me this loved abode, was there, Or not far off. Where'er my footsteps turned, Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang; The thought of her was like a flash of light Or an unseen companionship, a breath Or fragrance independent of the wind. In all my goings, in the new and old Of all my meditations, and in this Favourite of all, in this the most of all.... Embrace me then, ye hills, and close me in. Now in the clear and open day I feel Your guardianship: I take it to my heart; 'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night. But I would call thee beautiful; for mild, And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou art, Dear valley, having in thy face a smile, Though peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased, Pleased with thy crags, and woody steeps, thy Lake, Its one green Island, and its winding shores, The multitude of little rocky hills; Thy Church, and cottages of mountainstone Clustered like stars some few, but single most, And lurking dimly in their shy retreats, Or glancing at each other cheerful looks, Like separated stars with clouds between. VII. âBLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND WILD.â Bleak season was it, turbulent and wild, When hitherward we journeyed, side by side, Through bursts of sunshine and through flying showers, Paced the long Vales, how long they were, and yet How fast that length of way was left behind, Wensley's rich Vale and Sedbergh's naked heights. The frosty wind, as if to make amends For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps, And drove us onward as two ships at sea; Or, like two birds, companions in mid-air, Parted and reunited by the blast. Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced In that stern countenance; for our souls thence drew A feeling of their strength. The naked trees, The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared To question us, âWhence come ye? To what end?â VIII. AMONG ALL LOVELY THINGS MY LOVE HAD BEEN. Among all lovely things my Love had been; Had noted well the stars, all flowers that grew About her home; but she had never seen A Glow-worm, never one, and this I knew. While riding near her home one stormy night A single Glow-worm did I chance to espy; I gave a fervent welcome to the sight, And from my Horse I leapt; great joy had I. Upon a leaf the Glow-worm did I lay, To bear it with me through the stormy night: And, as before, it shone without dismay; Albeit putting forth a fainter light. When to the Dwelling of my Love I came, I went into the Orchard quietly; And left the Glow-worm, blessing it by name, Laid safely by itself, beneath a Tree. The whole next day, I hoped, and hoped with fear; At night the Glow-worm shone beneath the Tree: I led my Lucy to the spot, âLook here!â Oh! joy it was for her, and joy for me! IX. SONNET. I find it written of Simonides That travelling in strange countries once he found A corpse that lay expos'd upon the ground, For which, with pains, he caused due obsequies To be performed, and paid all holy fees. Soon after, this man's Ghost unto him came And told him not to sail as was his aim, On board a ship then ready for the seas. Simonides, admonished by the ghost, Remained behind; the ship the following day Set sail, was wrecked, and all on board were lost. Thus was the tenderest Poet that could be, Who sang in ancient Greece his moving lay, Saved out of many by his piety. X. GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN. Who weeps for strangers? Many wept For George and Sarah Green; Wept for that pair's unhappy fate, Whose grave may here be seen. By night, upon these stormy fells, Did wife and husband roam; Six little ones at home had left, And could not find that home. For any dwelling-place of man As vainly did they seek. He perish'd; and a voice was heardâ The widow's lonely shriek. Not many steps, and she was left A body without lifeâ A few short steps were the chain that bound The husband to the wife. Now do those sternly-featured hills Look gently on this grave; And quiet now are the depths of air, As a sea without a wave. But deeper lies the heart of peace In quiet more profound; The heart of quietness is here Within this churchyard bound. And from all agony of mind It keeps them safe, and far From fear and grief, and from all need Of sun or guiding star. O darkness of the grave! how deep, After that living nightâ That last and dreary living one Of sorrow and affright? O sacred marriage-bed of death, That keeps them side by side In bond of peace, in bond of love, That may not be untied! XI. TRANSLATION OF PART OF THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ÃNEID. To the Editors of the âPhilological Museum.â Your letter, reminding me of an expectation I some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the Ãneid to be printed in the âPhilological Museumâ, was not very acceptable; for I had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experimentâfor it was nothing moreâan experiment begun for amusement, and I now think a less fortunate one than when I first named it to you. Having been displeased in modern translations with the additions of incongruous matter, I began to translate with a resolve to keep clear of that fault, by adding nothing; but I became convinced that a spirited translation can scarcely be accomplished in the English language without admitting a principle of compensation. On this point, however, I do not wish to insist, and merely send the following passage, taken at random, from a wish to comply with your request. âW. W. But Cytherea, studious to invent Arts yet untried, upon new counsels bent, Resolves that Cupid, chang'd in form and face To young Ascanius, should assume his place; Present the maddening gifts, and kindle heat Of passion at the bosom's inmost seat. She dreads the treacherous house, the double tongue; She burns, she fretsâby Juno's rancour stung; The calm of night is powerless to remove These cares, and thus she speaks to winged Love: âO son, my strength, my power! who dost despise (What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies) The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee, O son, a suppliant to thy deity! What perils meet Ãneas in his course, How Juno's hate with unrelenting force Pursues thy brotherâthis to thee is known; And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own. Him now the generous Dido by soft chains Of bland entreaty at her court detains; Junonian hospitalities prepare Such apt occasion that I dread a snare. Hence, ere some hostile God can intervene, Would I, by previous wiles, inflame the queen With passion for Ãneas, such strong love That at my beck, mine only, she shall move. Hear, and assist;âthe father's mandate calls His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls; He comes, my dear delight,âand costliest things Preserv'd from fire and flood for presents brings. Him will I take, and in close covert keep, 'Mid groves Idalian, lull'd to gentle sleep, Or on Cythera's far-sequestered steep, That he may neither know what hope is mine, Nor by his presence traverse the design. Do thou, but for a single night's brief space, Dissemble; be that boy in form and face! And when enraptured Dido shall receive Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high, And goblets crown the proud festivity, Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire, At every touch, an unsuspected fire.â Love, at the word, before his mother's sight Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight, Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse The true Ascanius steep'd in placid rest; Then wafts him, cherish'd on her careful breast, Through upper air to an Idalian glade, Where he on soft amaracus is laid, With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade. But Cupid, following cheerily his guide Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied; And, as the hall he entered, there, between The sharers of her golden couch, was seen Reclin'd in festal pomp the Tyrian queen. The Trojans too (Ãneas at their head), On couches lie, with purple overspread: Meantime in canisters is heap'd the bread, Pellucid water for the hands is borne, And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn. Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare, As they in order stand, the dainty fare; And fume the household deities with store Of odorous incense; while a hundred more Match'd with an equal number of like age, But each of manly sex, a docile page, Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace To cup or viand its appointed place. The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band, Their painted couches seek, obedient to command. They look with wonder on the giftsâthey gaze Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays That from his ardent countenance are flung, And charm'd to hear his simulating tongue; Nor pass unprais'd the robe and veil divine, Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine. But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; She views the gifts; upon the child then turns Insatiable looks, and gazing burns. To ease a father's cheated love he hung Upon Ãneas, and around him clung; Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries; She fastens on the boy enamour'd eyes, Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!) How great a God, incumbent o'er her breast, Would fill it with his spirit. He, to please His Acidalian mother, by degrees Blots out SichÃ¦us, studious to remove The dead, by influx of a living love, By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest, Troubling a heart that had been long at rest. Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceas'd The first division of the splendid feast, While round a vacant board the chiefs recline, Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine; Voices of gladness roll the walls around; Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound; From gilded rafters many a blazing light Depends, and torches overcome the night. The minutes flyâtill, at the queen's command, A bowl of state is offered to her hand: Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine; Silence ensued. âO Jupiter, whose care Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer! Productive day be this of lasting joy To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy; A day to future generations dear! Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick'ning cheer, Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near! And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours wait Upon this hour, the bond to celebrate!â She spake and shed an offering on the board; Then sipp'd the bowl whence she the wine had pour'd And gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord; He rais'd the bowl, and took a long deep draught; Then every chief in turn the beverage quaff'd. Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings, The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings; Whence human kind, and brute; what natural powers Engender lightning, whence are falling showers. He chaunts Arcturus,âthat fraternal twain The glittering Bears,âthe Pleiads fraught with rain; âWhy suns in winter, shunning heaven's steep heights Post seaward,âwhat impedes the tardy nights. The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws Loud shouts,âthe Trojans echo the applause. âBut, lengthening out the night with converse new, Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew; Of Priam ask'd, of Hector,âo'er and o'erâ What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;â What steeds the car of Diomed could boast; Among the leaders of the Grecian host How looked Achillesâtheir dread paramountâ âBut nayâthe fatal wiles, O guest, recount, Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source, Your own grief and your friends'âyour wandering course; For now, till this seventh summer have ye rang'd The sea, or trod the earth, to peace estrang'd.â XII. SONNET. Author's Voyage Down the Rhine (Thirty Years Ago). The confidence of Youth our only Art, And Hope gay Pilot of the bold design, We saw the living Landscapes of the Rhine, Reach after reach, salute us and depart; Slow sink the Spires,âand up again they start! But who shall count the Towers as they recline O'er the dark steeps, or on the horizon line Striding, with shattered crests, the eye athwart? More touching still, more perfect was the pleasure, When hurrying forward till the slack'ning stream Spread like a spacious Mere, we there could measure A smooth free course along the watery gleam, Think calmly on the past, and mark at leisure Features which else had vanished like a dream. XIII. A CENTO MADE BY WORDSWORTH. For printing [the following piece] some reason should be given, as not a word of it is original: it is simply a fine stanza of Akenside, connected with a still finer from Beattie, by a couplet from Thomson. This practice, in which the author sometimes indulges, of linking together, in his own mind, favourite passages from different authors, seems in itself unobjectionable: but, as the publishing such compilations might lead to confusion in literature, he should deem himself inexcusable in giving this specimen, were it not from a hope that it might open to others a harmless source of private gratification. âW. W. Throned in the Sun's descending car What Power unseen diffuses far This tenderness of mind? What Genius smiles on yonder flood? What God in whispers from the wood Bids every thought be kind? O ever pleasing Solitude, Companion of the wise and good, Thy shades, thy silence, now be mine, Thy charms my only theme; My haunt the hollow cliff whose Pine Waves o'er the gloomy stream; Whence the scared Owl on pinions grey Breaks from the rustling boughs, And down the lone vale sails away To more profound repose! XIV. INSCRIPTION ON A ROCK AT RYDAL MOUNT. (1838.) Wouldst thou be gathered to Christ's chosen flock, Shun the broad way too easily explored, And let thy path be hewn out of the Rock, The living Rock of God's eternal Word. XV. PROTEST AGAINST THE BALLOT. (1838.) Forth rushed from Envy sprung and Self-conceit, A Power misnamed the Spirit of Reform, And through the astonished Island swept in storm, Threatening to lay all Orders at her feet That crossed her way. Now stoops she to entreat Licence to hide at intervals her head Where she may work, safe, undisquieted, In a close Box, covert for Justice meet. St. George of England! keep a watchful eye Fixed on the Suitor; frustrate her requestâ Stifle her hope; for, if the State comply, From such Pandorian gift may come a Pest Worse than the Dragon that bowed low his crest, Pierced by thy spear in glorious victory. XVI. A POET TO HIS GRANDCHILD. SEQUEL TO âA PLEA FOR AUTHORS.â âSon of my buried Son, while thus thy hand Is clasping mine, it saddens me to think How Want may press thee down, and with thee sink Thy Children left unfit, through vain demand Of culture, even to feel or understand My simplest Lay that to their memory May cling;âhard fate! which haply need not be Did Justice mould the Statutes of the Land. A Book time-cherished and an honoured name Are high rewards; but bound they Nature's claim Or Reason's? Noâhopes spun in timid line From out the bosom of a modest home Extend through unambitious years to come, My careless Little-one, for thee and thine!â May 23, 1838. XVII. ON A PORTRAIT OF I. F. [ISABELLA FENWICK], PAINTED BY MARGARET GILLIES. We gazeânor grieve to think that we must die, But that the precious love this friend hath sown Within our hearts, the love whose flower hath blown Bright as if heaven were ever in its eye, Will pass so soon from human memory; And not by strangers to our blood alone, But by our best descendants be unknown, Unthought ofâthis may surely claim a sigh. Yet, blessed Art, we yield not to dejection; Thou against Time so feelingly dost strive. Where'er, preserved in this most true reflection, An image of her soul is kept alive, Some lingering fragrance of the pure affection, Whose flower with us will vanish, must survive. Rydal Mount, New Year's Day, 1840. XVIII. TO I. F. The star which comes at close of day to shine More heavenly bright than when it leads the morn, Is Friendship's emblem, whether the forlorn She visiteth, or, shedding light benign Through shades that solemnize Life's calm decline, Doth make the happy happier. This have we Learnt, Isabel, from thy society, Which now we too unwillingly resign Though for brief absence. But farewell! the page Glimmers before my sight through thankful tears, Such as start forth, not seldom, to approve Our truth, when we, old yet unchilled by age, Call thee, though known but for a few fleet years, The heart-affianced sister of our love! Rydal Mount, Feb. 1840. XIX. âWHEN SEVERN'S SWEEPING FLOOD HAD OVERTHROWN.â When Severn's sweeping flood had overthrown St. Mary's Church, the preacher then would cry:â âThus, Christian people, God his might hath shown That ye to him your love may testify; Haste, and rebuild the pile.ââBut not a stone Resumed its place. Age after age went by, And Heaven still lacked its due, though piety In secret did, we trust, her loss bemoan. But now her Spirit hath put forth its claim In Power, and Poesy would lend her voice; Let the new Church be worthy of its aim, That in its beauty Cardiff may rejoice! Oh! in the past if cause there was for shame, Let not our times halt in their better choice. Rydal Mount, Jan. 23, 1842. XX. THE EAGLE AND THE DOVE. Shade of Caractacus, if spirits love The cause they fought for in their earthly home, To see the Eagle ruffled by the Dove May soothe thy memory of the chains of Rome. These children claim thee for their sire; the breath Of thy renown, from Cambrian mountains, fans A flame within them that despises death And glorifies the truant youth of Vannes. With thy own scorn of tyrants they advance, But truth divine has sanctified their rage, A silver cross enchased with Flowers of France Their badge, attests the holy fight they wage. The shrill defiance of the young crusade Their veteran foes mock as an idle noise; But unto Faith and Loyalty comes aid From Heaven, gigantic force to beardless boys. XXI. LINES INSCRIBED IN A COPY OF HIS POEMS SENT TO THE QUEEN FOR THE ROYAL LIBRARY AT WINDSOR. Deign, Sovereign Mistress! to accept a lay, No Laureate offering of elaborate art; But salutation taking its glad way From deep recesses of a loyal heart. Queen, Wife and Mother! may All-judging Heaven Shower with a bounteous hand on Thee and Thine Felicity that only can be given On earth to goodness blest by grace divine. Lady! devoutly honoured and beloved Through every realm confided to thy sway; May'st thou pursue thy course by God approved, And He will teach thy people to obey. As thou art wont, thy sovereignty adorn With woman's gentleness, yet firm and staid; So shall that earthly crown thy brows have worn Be changed for one whose glory cannot fade. And now by duty urged, I lay this Book Before thy Majesty, in humble trust That on its simplest pages thou wilt look With a benign indulgence more than just. Nor wilt thou blame an aged Poet's prayer, That issuing hence may steal into thy mind Some solace under weight of royal care, Or griefâthe inheritance of humankind. For know we not that from celestial spheres, When Time was young, an inspiration came (Oh were it mine!) to hallow saddest tears And help life onward in its noblest aim. W. W. January 9th, 1846. XXII. ODE ON THE INSTALLATION OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ALBERT AS CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, JULY, 1847. For thirst of power that Heaven disowns, For temples, towers, and thrones Too long insulted by the Spoiler's shock, Indignant Europe cast Her stormy foe at last To reap the whirlwind on a Libyan rock. War is passion's basest game Madly played to win a name: Up starts some tyrant, Earth and Heaven to dare, The servile million bow; But will the Lightning glance aside to spare The Despot's laurelled brow? War is mercy, glory, fame, Waged in Freedom's holy cause, Freedom, such as man may claim Under God's restraining laws. Such is Albion's fame and glory, Let rescued Europe tell the story. But lo! what sudden cloud has darkened all The land as with a funeral pall? The Rose of England suffers blight, The Flower has drooped, the Isle's delight: Flower and bud together fall; A Nation's hopes lie crushed in Claremont's desolate Hall. Time a chequered mantle wearsâ Earth awakes from wintry sleep: Again the Tree a blossom bears; Cease, Britannia, cease to weep! Hark to the peals on this bright Maymorn! They tell that your future Queen is born. A Guardian Angel fluttered Above the babe, unseen; One word he softly uttered, It named the future Queen; And a joyful cry through the Island rang, As clear and bold as the trumpet's clang, As bland as the reed of peace: âVICTORIA be her name!â For righteous triumphs are the base Whereon Britannia rests her peaceful fame. Time, in his mantle's sunniest fold Uplifted in his arms the child, And while the fearless infant smiled, Her happier destiny foretold:â âInfancy, by Wisdom mild, Trained to health and artless beauty; Youth, by pleasure unbeguiled From the lore of lofty duty; Womanhood in pure renown, Seated on her lineal throne; Leaves of myrtle in her Crown, Fresh with lustre all their own. Love, the treasure worth possessing More than all the world beside, This shall be her choicest blessing, Oft to royal hearts denied.â That eve, the Star of Brunswick shone With steadfast ray benign On Gotha's ducal roof, and on The softly flowing Leine, Nor failed to gild the spires of Bonn, And glittered on the Rhine. Old Camus, too, on that prophetic night Was conscious of the ray; And his willows whispered in its light, Not to the Zephyr's sway, But with a Delphic life, in sight Of this auspicious dayâ This day, when Granta hails her chosen Lord, And, proud of her award, Confiding in that Star serene, Welcomes the Consort of a happy Queen. Prince, in these collegiate bowers, Where science, leagued with holier truth, Guards the sacred heart of youth, Solemn monitors are ours. These reverend aisles, these hallowed towers, Raised by many a hand august, Are haunted by majestic Powers, The Memories of the Wise and Just, Who, faithful to a pious trust, Here, in the Founder's Spirit sought To mould and stamp the ore of thought In that bold form and impress high That best betoken patriot loyalty. Not in vain those Sages taught,â True disciples, good as great, Have pondered here their country's weal, Weighed the Future by the Past, Learned how social frames may last, And how a Land may rule its fate By constancy inviolate, Though worlds to their foundations reel The sport of factious Hate or godless Zeal. Albert, in thy race we cherish A Nation's strength that will not perish While England's sceptred Line True to the King of Kings is found; Like that Wise ancestor of thine Who threw the Saxon shield o'er Luther's life When first, above the yells of bigot strife, The trumpet of the Living Word Assumed a voice of deep portentous sound, From gladdened Elbe to startled Tiber heard. What shield more sublime E'er was blazoned or sung? And the PRINCE whom we greet From its Hero is sprung. Resound, resound the strain That hails him for our own! Again, again, and yet again, For the Church, the State, the Throne! And that Presence fair and bright, Ever blest wherever seen, Who deigns to grace our festal rite, The Pride of the Islands, VICTORIA THE QUEEN! The attribution of this poem is questionable. XXIII. QUINZAIN WRITTEN IN A GROTTO. CONJECTURALLY ASSIGNED TO WORDSWORTH. O Moon! if e'er I joyed when thy soft light Danc'd to the murmuring rill on Lomond's wave, Or sighed for thy sweet presence some dark night, When thou wert hidden in thy monthly grave; If e'er, on wings which active fancy gave, I sought thy golden vale with dancing flight, Then, stretcht at ease in some sequestered cave, Gaz'd on thy lovely Nymphs with fond delight, Thy Nymphs with more than earthly beauty bright; If e'er thy beam, as Smyrna's shepherds tell, Soft as the gentle kiss of amorous maid On the closed eyes of young Endymion fell, That he might wake to clasp thee in the shade: Each night, while I recline within this cell, Guide hither, O sweet Moon, the maid I love so well.</field>
