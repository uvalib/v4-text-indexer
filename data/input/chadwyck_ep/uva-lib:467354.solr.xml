      <field name="fulltext">“Listen; you may be allowed To hear my laughter from a cloud”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WORD AND QUESTION GAME [I have heard no word of my darling Jim] I have heard no word of my darling Jim, And I sit and weep by the sea; I am thinking and dreaming all day of him, Perhaps he is thinking of me. Perhaps he went wandering over the moor, And fell down a dark ravine; Perhaps he has gone on a cheap Cook's tour, And has married a dusky queen. Perhaps in a motor-car, far and fleet, He is scudding into the night; Perhaps he is sitting with wet, wet feet By the river to wait for a bite. Perhaps he's enlisted in the Police, Or fallen in the soup tureen; But my weary heart aching will never cease, And its O for the might-have-been! Send him back ye winds and ye waves so sad, Send him back ye Sprites and Jinns; For he's got my bottle of hair pomade, And my box of safety-pins. Question: What has become of Jim? Word: Safety-pins. THE HAUNTED HOUSE His body's dust and ashes, And he hasn't got no money; He clambers in through the window-sashes And squeaks like a tortured bunny; He hides in the flapping curtain, And he shouts in the singing flame; He's a nuisance in anyone's house, that's certain, But I don't know what's his name. When I go and get my candle, And crawl up to bed at night, He groans when I turn the parlour handle, And whisks up the stair in white. I can't tell you what he's after, Or what is his little game; I've had many a fright from his distant laughter, But I don't know what's his name. Is he solid or merely vapour? I think he's a blooming ghost. I wish I could pack him in strong brown paper And send him away by post. My life is a burden to me, I think it's a horrid shame. The screams of that bogey they go right through me, But I don't know what's his name. Question: What's his name? Word: Ashes. [“What is the use of waiting?”] “What is the use of waiting?” I heard a blackbird say, “The flowers are out, and without a doubt This is the month of May; So what is the use of waiting? The time has come for mating, And I'm off to find a wife to my mind On this beautiful golden day.” “What is the use of waiting?” Said a man in a parachute, “The balloon is bust, and I can't adjust The ribs of this tangled brute. So what is the use of waiting? I shall have to be gravitating; But a smaller jump and less of a bump On the hard round earth would suit.” “What is the use of waiting?” Said a man in evening dress, “The men I wait on they gorge like Satan, And can only say ‘More’ or ‘Yes.’ So what is the use of waiting? And forking and knifing and plating? I'd rather dwell in a prison cell Where the customers eat less.” Question: What is the use of waiting? Word: Parachute. [How far is it to London? Well, my friend] How far is it to London? Well, my friend, I do not answer questions till I know That he who asks them has a worthy end; If I should tell you truly, will you go? I hate a talkative and idle knave With silly questions always on his lips: “Who is your hatter?” “Where's Cock Robin's grave?” “What was the reason of the late eclipse?” You seem to me a promising young man, And if you really want to get away I shall be glad to help you if I can, I can't stand here debating all the day. A place there is to which I bid you go: It is not London; it is Jericho! Question: How far is it to London? Word: Eclipse. [When I go to my wardrobe and pull out my clo'es] When I go to my wardrobe and pull out my clo'es, I hang them on chairs and survey them in rows, And which will become me best who the deuce knows? My complexion is brown, and my eyes are pea-green, So the thing that will suit me (I learn from The Queen), Is a red shooting-coat trimmed with ultramarine. What's the use of discussing the hundred best books, Or the hundred best garments? What counts is your looks; The food is all right if you see to the cooks. So Gammon and Sneck up and Fiddle-de-dee, With your lubberly Lubbocks and cultured high tea! The hundred best books are the books that suit me. Question: What are the hundred best books? Word: Wardrobe. [Life rang the bell to call the people in] Life rang the bell to call the people in; The play was played by Folly, Pride, and Sin; Old Age, with fingers trembling and uncertain, Turned off the gas, and Death let down the curtain. Question: Who rang the bell? Word: Life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OCCASIONAL VERSE JOHANNESBURG, NEW YEAR, 1896 (“Several financiers have applied to the Boer Government for permission to leave the city.” —Daily papers, 9th January.) O alien blood and hearts of mud, who shall mete you the measure due? Remorse is a man's grim penance, and harrowing shame, but you— Do they care, your kind? Will ye call to mind that day of the days gone by When your panic yelp brought men to help, and ye kennelled, and let them die? Helots of Boers ye have been, their helots ye still shall be, Their brand on your craven foreheads shall sever you from the free. Grab, when the till is opened; at the crack of the musket, fly! Gibber with fear when ye see draw near the death that ye dare not die! Live then, and shame the living; live, as the mongrel can, Safe in the friendly limbo of the scorn of God and man: Not heaven or earth will judge you, ye must take your cause to try Where deep in hell your brethren dwell, the worms that cannot die. TO A LADY WITH AN UNRULY AND ILL-MANNERED DOG Who bit several Persons of Importance Your dog is not a dog of grace; He does not wag the tail or beg; He bit Miss Dickson in the face; He bit a Bailie in the leg. What tragic choices such a dog Presents to visitor or friend! Outside there is the Glasgow fog; Within, a hydrophobic end. Yet some relief even terror brings, For when our life is cold and gray We waste our strength on little things, And fret our puny souls away. A snarl! A scuffle round the room! A sense that Death is drawing near! And human creatures reassume The elemental robe of fear. So when my colleague makes his moan Of careless cooks, and warts, and debt, —Enlarge his views, restore his tone, And introduce him to your Pet! Quod Raleigh. Uffington, Berkshire 8th May 1903 STANS PUER AD MENSAM Attend my words, my gentle knave, And you shall learn from me How boys at dinner may behave With due propriety. Guard well your hands: two things have been Unfitly used by some; The trencher for a tambourine, The table for a drum. We could not lead a pleasant life, And 'twould be finished soon, If peas were eaten with the knife, And gravy with the spoon. Eat slowly: only men in rags And gluttons old in sin Mistake themselves for carpet bags And tumble victuals in. The privy pinch, the whispered tease, The wild, unseemly yell— When children do such things as these, We say, “It is not well.” Endure your mother's timely stare, Your father's righteous ire, And do not wriggle on your chair Like flannel in the fire. Be silent: you may chatter loud When you are fully grown, Surrounded by a silent crowd Of children of your own. If you should suddenly feel bored And much inclined to yawning, Your little hand will best afford A modest useful awning. Think highly of the Cat: and yet You need not therefore think That portly strangers like your pet To share their meat and drink. The end of dinner comes ere long When, once more full and free, You cheerfully may bide the gong That calls you to your tea. A Literature Lesson. SIR PATRICK SPENS In the Eighteenth Century manner Verse I In a famed town of Caledonia's land, A prosperous port contiguous to the strand, A monarch feasted in right royal state; [Note the moral reflection.]But care still dogs the pleasures of the Great, And well his faithful servants could surmise From his distracted looks and broken sighs [Note the cheap contrast of colours.]That though the purple bowl was circling free, His mind was prey to black perplexity. At last, while others thoughtless joys invoke, Fierce from his breast the laboured utterance broke; “Alas!” he cried, “and what to me the gain Though I am king of all this fair domain, Though Ceres minister her plenteous hoard, [Deus intersit.]And Bacchus with his bounty crowns my board, If Neptune still, reluctant to obey, [Note the tautology.]Neglects my sceptre and denies my sway? [Note the idle fury of the vessels.]On a far mission must my vessels urge Their course impetuous o'er the boiling surge; But who shall guide them with a dextrous hand, And bring them safely to that distant land? Whose skill shall dare the perils of the deep, And beard the Sea-god in his stormy keep? Verse II He spake: and straightway, rising from his side An ancient senator, of reverend pride, Unsealed his lips, and uttered from his soul Great store of flatulence and rigmarole; —All fled the Court, which shades of night invest, And Pope and Gay and Prior told the rest. Nov. 1900 LINES SUGGESTED BY AN EDITION OF BLAKE'S POEMS I have taken to the Blake manner: “If you try to do what's right You pass your life in a horrible fright, And your Emanation—Lord protect her!— Commits adultery with your Spectre.” I write to you because you won't write to me: “He that answers a Friend's letter Makes the Morning Star his debtor.” I like the visionary style. Poplar, Malden, and Lambeth's Vale Each held on to the other's tail; Poplar lived on chickweed and groundsel, Malden danced to please the Council; Lambeth's Vale in an old plug hat Played the bones on the front-door mat, And then crept round to the back garden To get his money and ask for pardon. A Christian's heart is never hard, So they gave him a pound of lard. What's the reason, Christians, tell, Why the most of us go to Hell? Oxford 27th Oct. 1905 THE ARTIST The Artist and his Luckless Wife They lead a horrid haunted life, Surrounded by the things he's made That are not wanted by the trade. The world is very fair to see; The Artist will not let it be; He fiddles with the works of God, And makes them look uncommon odd. The Artist is an awful man, He does not do the things he can; He does the things he cannot do, And we attend the private view. The Artist uses honest paint To represent things as they ain't, He then asks money for the time It took to perpetrate the crime. 1917 THE BATTLE HYMN OF KENSIT'S MEN (Written in collaboration with Charles Strachey) 1 The Church is in a hawful state, With Richerlists and such; The Pope 'e won't 'ave long to wait For most of 'em—not much! So Mister Kensit's took the 'ump (And rightly too, says I), And when 'e goes upon the stump You'll see the feathers fly. Then pack yer traps, and clear the way; depart, be gone, get Hout! And make no noise, or Kensit's boys 'll show you 'oo can shout;— No more of yer 'anky panky now, no more of yer Romish rot, For Johnny K. is hon the way to bust the blooming lot. 2 They've aconites and chasubells (Same like the Papists wears), And makes the most unchristian smells With hincense at their prayers; They've sacred pictures by the stack, And lamps that halways burn; Such 'eaps of 'oly bric-a-brac, There's 'ardly room to turn! So pack yer traps, etc. 3 Now what would Martin Luther say If 'e come back to earth? (And 'e was never in 'is day A foe to Honest Mirth)— I think that 'im and old John Knox Would twig the little game, And, knowing it was 'eterodox, They simply would exclaim— Now pack yer traps, etc. 4 A prayer may serve a useful hend With something for to git, But prayer for Nokes, my pore old friend, Is neither sense nor wit; 'E's safely planted hin 'is grave, (No longer hin the swim) —Hup comes a low blasphemious knave And takes and prays for 'im. Then pack yer traps, etc. 5 It fairly makes my blood to bile, That Jesuites from Rome Should crawl about the 'arth and spile The sanctity of 'ome; And if my missus, or the gals, Gets talkative, and tries To blab in them confessionals I'll black their blooming eyes! Then pack yer traps, etc. 6 I went into St. Ninny's Church, Where those so-called divines Do bob, and jinnyflect and lurch, Figged up unto the nines; I ups and says—“You un'oly clown, 'Ow dare you 'ave the face To go a capering hup and down Before the Throne of Grace? Now pack yer traps, etc. 7 “I don't object to fancy dress On niggers at the races; I'm fond of dancin', I confess, (That is, in proper places); But parsons doing cellar-flaps To music by the band, Rigged out in petticoats and caps, Is more than I can stand.” So pack yer traps, etc. 8 “Sit down!”—says 'e. “I won't”—says I. “Then, verger, turn 'im out.” With that I lets a Bible fly, And lands 'im hon the snout: To stop 'is richerlistic row I knocked 'im orf 'is perch, And there and then we taught 'im 'ow To desecrate a Church. Then pack yer traps, etc. 9 My friends all stuck to me like bricks, The 'ymn-books flew like 'ail; With one of them big candlesticks I smashed the haltar-rail: The idolaters set up a squall, But soon they got the Toe:— We made a 'olesome Gospel-'all Of that galanty-show. So pack yer traps, etc. 10 Come all you noble Protestants (For 'alf the job ain't done), It is your 'elp that Hengland wants— Yuss! Hevery mother's son! If each of you brings 'alf a brick, A better church we'll raise Than hany blooming Cawtholic In hall 'is blighted days. They'll pack their traps, they'll clear the way, depart—be gone—get Hout— They'll make no noise, or we're the boys will show them 'oo can shout! They'll stow their 'anky-panky then, they'll chuck their Romish rot, When Johnny K. 'as 'ad 'is way and bust the blooming lot. ODE To The Glasgow Ballad Club 21st December 1901 Men and Bards! I, whom my dull brain retards, Cannot make an ode that beats Keats. Yet I fain Would uplift my humble strain As your grateful and distressed Guest. Emerson Says the bard must dwell alone, Social habits make his verse Worse. This may be In the cities oversea, Boston or New York, or Hong Kong. Here we find That it elevates the mind, And revives the muse to hob- nob. Must we shine, Buried diamonds in a mine, Wasting rays that might adorn Morn. Joined in one We shall glitter in the sun (When he next illumines Clyde- side). Though our songs Cannot vanquish ancient wrongs; Though they follow where the rose Goes; And their sound, Swooning over hollow ground, Fade and leave the enchanted air Bare; Yet the wise Say that not unblest he dies Who has known a single May Day. If we have laughed, Loved, and laboured in our craft, We may pass with a resigned Mind. While our cage Is this narrow Iron Age, Make it ring with many a brave Stave! —But enough Of this complicated stuff, Lest the critics murmur “Hoots Toots!” Some are foes To whatever is not prose; Verse, they say, is merely fact Cracked. You may meet Daily in the public street Men who call a sonnet clap- Trap. Here's a health! To the poets wine and wealth; Let the critics go to—well— Hell! TO PROFESSOR H. A. STRONG, LL. D. 24th November 1900 Dear Strang, On this your natal day, We Glaisgie bodies wish to say We're sorry that we canna gae That far to see ye; But though oor bodies here maun stay, In hairt we're wi' ye. The Northern clans, wi' pipes and drones— The “Scotswhahaes” and brave “Hechmons,” The “Hootsawas” and “Sodascones”— Are here thegither; And ilka ane in joyful tones Proclaims you brither. We're fine and glad ye didna scorn The fashious wark o' being born, Whilk wad ha' left us sair forlorn; But noo—Losh guide us!— Ye're fand, this braw November morn, On airth beside us. 'Twas in this toun ye first assayed The ancient gerund-grinding trade, Wi' Latin in a spune ye gaed The fowk to feed them; And eh! the bonny jokes ye made— Deil kens wha seed them! Oor thochts hae dwalt upon you aft, The climate's turned a wee thing saft, Oor college noo wi' gowks is staffed, Wi' gomerals deevit; But, Lord be praised! there's Heaven alaft, And here, Glenleevit. In Scotlan' nane need droop or dwine; For them that feels their stren'th decline The certain cure (it's just divine) Each year returns (Whilk mony a lassie had lang syne) —A nicht wi' Burns. We twa hae strayed ower Brownlow Hill, And pu'd lang faces on the sill, While toddling ben to yon auld mill That still plays clatter; —And auld Mackay is there, and still As daft's a hatter. Lang may the flags o' Bedford Street Resound beneath your honoured feet! Lang may ye hauld your annual treat For a' the leddies! Lang may ye flout and jink and cheat The Laird o' Hades! SESTINA OTIOSA Our great work, the Otia Merseiana, Edited by learned Mister Sampson, And supported by Professor Woodward, Is financed by numerous Bogus Meetings Hastily convened by Kuno Meyer To impose upon the Man of Business. All in vain! The accomplished Man of Business Disapproves of Otia Merseiana, Turns his back on Doctor Kuno Meyer; Cannot be enticed by Mister Sampson, To be present at the Bogus Meetings, Though attended by Professor Woodward. Little cares the staid Professor Woodward: He, being something of a man of business, Knows that not a hundred Bogus Meetings To discuss the Otia Merseiana Can involve himself and Mister Sampson In the debts of Doctor Kuno Meyer. So the poor deluded Kuno Meyer, Unenlightened by Professor Woodward— Whom, upon the word of Mister Sampson, He believes to be a man of business Fit to run the Otia Merseiana— Keeps on calling endless Bogus Meetings. Every week has now its Bogus Meetings, Punctually convened by Kuno Meyer In the name of Otia Merseiana: Every other week Professor Woodward Takes his place, and, as a man of business, Audits the accounts with Mister Sampson. He and impecunious Mister Sampson Are the mainstay of the Bogus Meetings; But the alienated Man of Business Cannot be allured by Kuno Meyer To attend and meet Professor Woodward, Glory of the Otia Merseiana. Kuno Meyer! Great Professor Woodward! Bogus Meetings damn, for men of business, Mister Sampson's Otia Merseiana. ON J??? M????? Founder of the Society for the Suppression of Demoralizing Literature “Henceforth let all Creation be refined!” Said M?????, sole Protector of the Mind; By none of my young men let it be said That rivers come together in their bed; And if they write of Venus—very well, They write; I do not print; it does not sell; I mean, it does not sell; I do not print; —I hope that my young men will take the hint. My grandfather, who licked the boots of Byron, Thought chaste themes best for bards to spank the lyre on; But Byron was a young man in a hurry; He's gone the Lord knows where, and I'm J??? M?????. WISHES OF AN ELDERLY MAN Wished at a Garden Party, June 1914 I wish I loved the Human Race; I wish I loved its silly face; I wish I liked the way it walks; I wish I liked the way it talks; And when I'm introduced to one I wish I thought What Jolly Fun! SONNET To J. S. March 1908 I never cared for literature as such. The spondee, dactyl, trochee, anapaest, Do not inflame my passions in the least; And cultured persons do not please me much. Great works may be composed in French or Dutch, Yet my poor happiness is not increased: To me the learned critic is a beast, And poetry a decorated crutch. One book among the rest is dear to me; As when a man, having tired himself in deed Against the world, and, falling back to write, Sated with love, or crazed by vanity, Or drunk with joy, or maimed by Fortune's spite, Sets down his Paternoster and his Creed. MY LAST WILL When I am safely laid away, Out of work and out of play, Sheltered by the kindly ground From the world of sight and sound, One or two of those I leave Will remember me and grieve, Thinking how I made them gay By the things I used to say; —But the crown of their distress Will be my untidiness. What a nuisance then will be All that shall remain of me! Shelves of books I never read, Piles of bills, undocketed, Shaving-brushes, razors, strops, Bottles that have lost their tops, Boxes full of odds and ends, Letters from departed friends, Faded ties and broken braces Tucked away in secret places, Baggy trousers, ragged coats, Stacks of ancient lecture-notes, And that ghostliest of shows, Boots and shoes in horrid rows. Though they are of cheerful mind, My lovers, whom I leave behind, When they find these in my stead, Will be sorry I am dead. They will grieve; but you, my dear, Who have never tasted fear, Brave companion of my youth, Free as air and true as truth, Do not let these weary things Rob you of your junketings. Burn the papers; sell the books; Clear out all the pestered nooks; Make a mighty funeral pyre For the corpse of old desire, Till there shall remain of it Naught but ashes in a pit: And when you have done away All that is of yesterday, If you feel a thrill of pain, Master it, and start again. This, at least, you have never done Since you first beheld the sun: If you came upon your own Blind to light and deaf to tone, Basking in the great release Of unconsciousness and peace, You would never, while you live, Shatter what you cannot give; —Faithful to the watch you keep, You would never break their sleep. Clouds will sail and winds will blow As they did an age ago O'er us who lived in little towns Underneath the Berkshire downs. When at heart you shall be sad, Pondering the joys we had, Listen and keep very still. If the lowing from the hill Or the tolling of a bell Do not serve to break the spell, Listen; you may be allowed To hear my laughter from a cloud. Take the good that life can give For the time you have to live. Friends of yours and friends of mine Surely will not let you pine. Sons and daughters will not spare More than friendly love and care. If the Fates are kind to you, Some will stay to see you through; And the time will not be long Till the silence ends the song. Sleep is God's own gift; and man, Snatching all the joys he can, Would not dare to give his voice To reverse his Maker's choice. Brief delight, eternal quiet, How change these for endless riot Broken by a single rest? Well you know that sleep is best. We that have been heart to heart Fall asleep, and drift apart. Will that overwhelming tide Reunite us, or divide? Whence we come and whither go None can tell us, but I know Passion's self is often marred By a kind of self-regard, And the torture of the cry “You are you, and I am I.” While we live, the waking sense Feeds upon our difference, In our passion and our pride Not united, but allied. We are severed by the sun, And by darkness are made one. Oxford, 1919</field>
