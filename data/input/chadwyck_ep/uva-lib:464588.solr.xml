Storys to rede ar delitabill Suppos yat yai be nocht bot fabill, Yan suld storys yat suthfast wer And yai war said on gud maner Hawe doubill plesance in heryng. Ye fyrst plesance is ye carpyng, And ye toyer ye suthfastnes Yat schawys ye thing rycht as it wes, And suth thyngis yat ar likand Tyll mannys heryng ar plesand. Yarfor I wald fayne set my will Giff my wyt mycht suffice yartill To put in wryt a suthfast story Yat it lest ay furth in memory Swa yat na tyme of lenth it let Na ger it haly be for?et. For auld storys yat men redys Representis to yaim ye dedys Of stalwart folk yat lywyt ar Rycht as yai yan in presence war. And certis yai suld weill hawe prys Yat in yar tyme war wycht and wys, And led yar lyff in gret trawaill, And oft in hard stour off bataill Wan gret price off chewalry And war woydyt off cowardy, As wes king Robert off Scotland Yat hardy wes off hart and hand, And gud schyr Iames off Douglas Yat in his tyme sa worthy was Yat off hys price &amp; hys bounte In ser landis renownyt wes he. Off yaim I thynk yis buk to ma, Now God gyff grace yat I may swa Tret it and bryng it till endyng Yat I say nocht bot suthfast thing. Qwhen Alexander ye king wes deid Yat Scotland haid to steyr &amp; leid, Ye land [sex] ?er &amp; mayr perfay Lay desolat eftyr hys day Till yat ye barnage at ye last Assemblyt yaim and fayndyt fast To cheys a king yar land to ster Yat off awncestry cummyn wer Off kingis yat aucht yat reawte And mayst had rycht yair king to be. Bot enwy yat is sa feloune Maid amang yaim gret discencioun, For sum wald haiff ye Balleoll king For he wes cummyn off ye offspryng Off hyr yat eldest syster was, And oyer sum nyt all yat cas And said yat he yair king suld be Yat war in als ner degre And cummyn war of ye [neyst] male And in branch collaterale. Yai said successioun of kyngrik Was nocht to lawer feys lik, For yar mycht succed na female Quhill foundyn mycht be ony male How yat in [lyne] ewyn descendand. Yai bar all oyer-wayis on hand, For yan ye neyst cummyn off ye seid Man or woman suld succeid. Be yis resoun yat part thocht hale Yat ye lord off Anandyrdale Robert ye Brwys erle off Carryk Aucht to succeid to ye kynryk. Ye barownys yus war at discord Yat on na maner mycht accord, Till at ye last yai all concordyt Yat all yar spek suld be recordyt Till Schyr Eduuard off Yngland king, And he suld swer yat but fen?eyng He suld yat arbytre disclar Off yir twa yat I tauld off ar Quhilk succeid to sic a hycht, And lat him ryng yat had ye rycht. Yis ordynance yaim thocht ye best, For at that tyme wes pes and rest Betwyx Scotland and Ingland bath, And yai couth nocht persawe ye skaith Yat towart yaim wes apperand. For yat at ye king off Ingland Held swylk freyndschip and cumpany To yar king yat wes swa worthy, Yai trowyt yat he as gud nychtbur And as freyndsome compositur Wald hawe iugyt in lawte, Bot oyir-wayis all ?heid ye gle. A blynd folk full off all foly, Haid ?e wmbethocht ?ow enkrely Quhat perell to ?ow mycht apper ?e had nocht wrocht on yat maner. Haid ?e tane keip how at yat king Alwayis for-owtyn soiournyng Trawayllyt for to wyn sen?hory And throw his mycht till occupy Landis yat war till him marcheand As Walis was and als Ireland, Yat he put to swylk thrillage Yat yai yat war off hey parage Suld ryn on fute as rebaldaill Quhen he wald our folk assail. Durst nane of Walis in bataill ride Na yhet fra ewyn fell abyd Castell or wallyt toune within Yat he ne suld lyff and lymmys tyne, In-to swilk thrillage yaim held he Yat he ourcome throw his powste. ?e mycht se he suld occupy Throw slycht yat he ne mycht throw maistri. Had ?e tane kep quhat was thrillag And had consideryt his vsage Yat gryppyt ay but gayne-gevyng, ?e suld for-owtyn his demyng Haiff chosyn ?ow a king yat mycht Have haldyn veyle ye land in rycht. Walys ensample mycht have bene To ?ow had ?e it forow sene, [And wys men sayis he is happy Yat be oyer will him chasty,] For wnfayr thingis may fall perfay Als weill to-morn as ?histerday. Bot ?e traistyt in lawte As sympile folk but mawyte, And wyst nocht quhat suld efter tyd. For in yis warld yat is sa wyde Is nane determynat yat sall Knaw thingis yat ar to fall, Bot God yat is off maist poweste Reserwyt till his maieste For to knaw in his prescience Off alkyn tyme ye mowence. On yis maner assentyt war Ye barownis as I said ?ow ar, And throuch yar aller hale assent Messingeris till hym yai sent, Yat was yan in ye haly land On Saracenys warrayand. And fra he wyst quhat charge yai had He buskyt hym but mar abad And left purpos yat he had tane And till Ingland agayne is gane, And syne till Scotland word send he Yat yai suld mak ane assemble, And he in hy suld cum to do In all thing as yai wrayt him to. Bot he thocht weile throuch yar debat Yat he suld slely fynd ye gate How yat he all ye sen?howry Throw his gret mycht suld occupy. And to Robert ye Brwys said he, ‘Gyff yow will hald in cheyff off me For euermar, and yine ofspryng, I sall do swa yow sall be king.’ ‘Schyr,’ said he, ‘sa God me save Ye kynryk ?harn I nocht to have Bot gyff it fall off rycht to me, And gyff God will yat it sa be I sall als frely in all thing Hald it as it afferis to king, Or as myn eldris forouth me Held it in freyast reawte.’ Ye toyir wreyth him and swar Yat he suld have it neuer mar And turnyt him in wreth away. Bot Schyr Ihon the Balleoll perfay Assentyt till him in all his will, Quhar-throuch fell efter mekill ill. He was king bot a litill quhile And throuch gret sutelte and ghyle For litill enchesone or nane He was arestyt syne and tane, And degradyt syne wes he Off honour and off dignite, Quheyer it wes throuch wrang or rycht God wat it yat is maist off mycht. Quhen Schyr Edward ye mychty king Had on yis wys done his likyng Off Ihone ye Balleoll, yat swa sone Was all defawtyt &amp; wndone, To Scotland went he yan in hy, And all ye land gan occupy Sa hale yat bath castell &amp; toune War in-till his possessioune [Fra Weik anent Orknay] To Mullyr snwk in Gallaway, And stuffyt all with Inglis-men. Schyrreffys and bail?heys maid he yen, And alkyn oyer officeris Yat for to gowern land afferis He maid off Inglis nation, Yat worthyt yan sa rych fellone And sa wykkyt and cowatous And swa hawtane and dispitous Yat Scottis-men mycht do na thing Yat euer mycht pleys to yar liking. Yar wyffis wald yai oft forly And yar dochtrys dispitusly And gyff ony of yaim yar-at war wrath Yai watyt hym wele with gret scaith, For yai suld fynd sone enchesone To put hym to destruccione. And gyff yat ony man yaim by Had ony thing yat wes worthy, As hors or hund or oyer thing Yat war plesand to yar liking, With rycht or wrang it have wald yai, And gyf ony wald yaim withsay Yai suld swa do yat yai suld tyne Oyir land or lyff or leyff in pyne, For yai dempt yaim efter yar will, Takand na kep to rycht na skill. A quhat yai dempt yaim felonly, For gud knychtis yat war worthy For litill enchesoune or yan nane Yai hangyt be ye nekbane. [Alas] yat folk yat euer wes fre, And in fredome wount for to be, Throw yar gret myschance and foly War tretyt yan sa wykkytly Yat yar fays yar iugis war, Quhat wrechitnes may man have mar. A, fredome is a noble thing, Fredome mays man to haiff liking, Fredome all solace to man giffis, He levys at es yat frely levys. A noble hart may haiff nane es Na ellys nocht yat may him ples Gyff fredome fail?he, for fre liking Is ?harnyt our all oyer thing. Na he yat ay has levyt fre May nocht knaw weill ye propyrte Ye angyr na ye wrechyt dome Yat is cowplyt to foule thyrldome, Bot gyff he had assayit it. Yan all perquer he suld it wyt, And suld think fredome mar to prys Yan all ye gold in warld yat is. Yus contrar thingis euer-mar Discoweryngis off ye toyer ar, And he yat thryll is has nocht his. All yat he has enbandownyt is Till hys lord quhat-euer he be. Yheyt has he nocht sa mekill fre As fre wyll to leyve or do Yat at hys hart hym drawis to. Yan mays clerkis questioun Quhen yai fall in disputacioun Yat gyff man bad his thryll owcht do, And in ye samyn tym come him to His wyff and askyt him hyr det, Quheyer he his lordis neid suld let, And pay fryst yat he awcht, &amp; syne Do furth his lordis commandyne, Or leve onpayit his wyff and do Yai thingis yat commaundyt is him to. I leve all ye solucioun Till yaim yat ar off mar renoun, Bot sen yai mak sic comperyng Betwix ye dettis off wedding And lordis bidding till his threll, ?e may weile se youcht nane ?ow tell How hard a thing yat threldome is. For men may weile se yat ar wys Yat wedding is ye hardest band Yat ony man may tak on hand, And thryldome is weill wer yan deid, For quhill a thryll his lyff may leid It merrys him body and banys, And dede anoyis him bot anys. Schortly to say, is nane can tell Ye halle condicioun off a threll. Thus-gat levyt yai &amp; in sic thrillage Bath pur and yai off hey parag, For off ye lordis sum yai slew And sum yai hangyt and sum yai drew, And sum yai put in presoune For-owtyn caus or enchesoun, And amang oyer off Dowglas Put in presoun Schir Wil?am was Yat off Dowglas was lord and syr, Off him yai makyt a martyr. Fra yai in presoune him sleuch Hys land yat is fayr inewch Yai ye lord off Clyffurd gave. He had a sone, a litill knave, Yat wes yan bot a litill page, Bot syne he wes off gret waslage. Hys fadyr dede he wengyt sua Yat in Ingland I wnderta Wes nane off lyve yat hym ne dred, For he sa fele off harnys sched Yat nane yat lyvys yaim can tell. Bot wonderly hard thing fell Till him or he till state wes brocht. Yair wes nane auentur yat mocht Stunay hys hart na ger him let To do ye thing yat he wes on set, For he thocht ay encrely To do his deid awysily. He thocht weill he was worth na seyle Yat mycht of nane anoyis feyle, &amp; als for till escheve gret thingis And hard trawalys and barganyngis, Yat suld ger his price dowblyt be. Quharfor in all hys lyve-tyme he Wes in gret payn and gret trawaill, And neuer wald for myscheiff faill, Bot dryve ye thing rycht to ye end And tak ye vre yat God wald send. Hys name wes Iames of Douglas, &amp; quhen he herd his fader was Put in presoune so fellounly, And at his landis halyly War gevyn to ye Clyffurd perfay He wyst nocht quhat to do na say, For he had na thing for to dispend Na yar wes nane yat euer [him] kend Wald do sa mekill for him yat he Mycht sufficiantly fundyn be. Yan wes he wonder will off wane, And sodanly in hart has tane Yat he wald trawaile our ye se And a quhile in Parys be, And dre myscheiff quhar nane hym kend Till God sum succouris till hym send. And as he thocht he did rycht sua, And sone to Parys can he ga And levyt yar full sympylly, Ye-quheyer he glaid was and ioly, And till swylk thowlesnes he ?eid As ye cours askis off ?owtheid, And wmquhill in-to rybbaldaill. And yat may mony tyme awaill, For knawlage off mony statis May quhile awail?e full mony gatis, As to ye gud erle off Artayis Robert befell in his dayis, For oft feyn?eyng off rybbaldy Awail?eit him and yat gretly. And Catone sayis ws in his wryt Yat to fenyhe foly quhile is wyt. In Parys ner thre ?er duellyt he, And yen come tythandis our ye se Yat his fadyr wes done to ded. Yen wes he wa and will of red, And thocht yat he wald hame agayne To luk gyff he throw ony payn Mycht wyn agayn his heritage And his men out off all thryllage. To Sanct Androws he come in hy, Quhar ye byschop full curtasly Resavyt him, and gert him wer His knyvys forouth him to scher, And cled him rycht honorabilly And gert ordayn quhar he suld ly. A weile gret quhile yar duellyt he. All men lufyt him for his bounte, For he wes off full fayr effer Wys curtais and deboner. Larg and luffand als wes he, And our all thing luffyt lawte. Leavte to luff is gretumly, Throuch leavte liffis men rychtwisly. With a wertu &amp; leavte A man may ?eit sufficyand be, And but leawte may nane haiff price Queyer he be wycht or he be wys, For quhar it fail?eys na wertu May be off price na off valu To mak a man sa gud yat he May symply callyt gud man be.

And quhen yai lang yus sorowit had, And he debowaillyt wes clenly And bawmyt syne richly, And ye worthi lord of Douglas His hart as it for-spokyn was Has ressawyt in gret daynte With gret fayr and solemnyte, Yai haiff had hym to Dunferlyne And him solemply erdyt syne In a fayr tumb in-till ye quer.

A lang way furthwart saylit he, For betuix Cornwaill and Bretaynne He sayllyt, and left ye Grun?e of Spain?e On northalff him, and held yar way Quhill to Sabill ye Graunt com yai, Bot gretly war his men and he Trawaillyt with tempestis of ye se, Bot yocht yai gretly trawaillit war Hale and fer ar yai cummyn yar.

Apon yis maner still yai lay Quhill throw ye countre yai hard say Yat ye hey king of Balmeryne With mony a mody Saryzine Was entryt in-till ye land off Span?e All hale ye countre to [man?e].

Bot to tell off yar sorowing It noyis and helpis litill thing, Men may weill wyt youcht nane yaim tell How angry for sorow and how fell Is to tyne sic a lord as he To yaim yat war off his mengne, For he wes swete and debonar And weill couth trete hys frendis far, And his fayis rycht fellounly Stonay throw hys chewalry Ye-quheyer off litill affer wes he.
