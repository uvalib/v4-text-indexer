      <field name="fulltext">AVE MARIA I In the ages of Faith, before the day When men were too proud to weep or pray, There stood in a red-roofed Breton town Snugly nestled 'twixt sea and down, A chapel for simple souls to meet, Nightly, and sing with voices sweet, Ave Maria! II There was an idiot, palsied, bleared, With unkempt locks and a matted beard, Hunched from the cradle, vacant-eyed, And whose head kept rolling from side to side; Yet who, when the sunset-glow grew dim, Joined with the rest in the twilight hymn, Ave Maria! III But when they up-got and wended home, Those up the hillside, these to the foam, He hobbled along in the narrowing dusk, Like a thing that is only hull and husk; On as he hobbled, chanting still, Now to himself, now loud and shrill, Ave Maria! IV When morning smiled on the smiling deep, And the fisherman woke from dreamless sleep, And ran up his sail, and trimmed his craft, While his little ones leaped on the sand and laughed, The senseless cripple would stand and stare, Then suddenly holloa his wonted prayer, Ave Maria! V Others might plough, and reap, and sow, Delve in the sunshine, spin in snow, Make sweet love in a shelter sweet, Or trundle their dead in a winding-sheet; But he, through rapture, and pain, and wrong, Kept singing his one monotonous song, Ave Maria! VI When thunder growled from the ravelled wrack, And ocean to welkin bellowed back, And the lightning sprang from its cloudy sheath, And tore through the forest with jaggÃ¨d teeth, Then leaped and laughed o'er the havoc wreaked, The idiot clapped with his hands, and shrieked, Ave Maria! VII Children mocked, and mimicked his feet, As he slouched or sidled along the street; Maidens shrank as he passed them by, And mothers with child eschewed his eye; And half in pity, half scorn, the folk Christened him, from the words he spoke, Ave Maria. VIII One year when the harvest feasts were done, And the mending of tattered nets begun, And the kittiwake's scream took a weirder key From the wailing wind and the moaning sea, He was found, at morn, on the fresh-strewn snow, Frozen, and faint, and crooning low, Ave Maria! IX They stirred up the ashes between the dogs, And warmed his limbs by the blazing logs, Chafed his puckered and bloodless skin, And strove to quiet his chattering chin; But, ebbing with unreturning tide, He kept on murmuring till he died, Ave Maria! X Idiot, soulless, brute from birth, He could not be buried in sacred earth; So they laid him afar, apart, alone, Without or a cross, or turf, or stone, Senseless clay unto senseless clay, To which none ever came nigh to say, Ave Maria! XI When the meads grew saffron, the hawthorn white, And the lark bore his music out of sight, And the swallow outraced the racing wave, Up from the lonely, outcast grave Sprouted a lily, straight and high, Such as She bears to whom men cry, Ave Maria! XII None had planted it, no one knew How it had come there, why it grew; Grew up strong, till its stately stem Was crowned with a snow-white diadem,â One pure lily, round which, behold! Was written by God in veins of gold, âAve Maria!â XIII Over the lily they built a shrine, Where are mingled the mystic bread and wine; Shrine you may see in the little town That is snugly nestled 'twixt deep and down. Through the Breton land it hath wondrous fame, And it bears the unshriven idiot's name, Ave Maria. XIV Hunchbacked, gibbering, blear-eyed, halt, From forehead to footstep one foul fault, Crazy, contorted, mindless-born, The gentle's pity, the cruel's scorn, Who shall bar you the gates of Day, So you have simple faith to say, Ave Maria? AGATHA I She wanders in the April woods, That glisten with the fallen shower; She leans her face against the buds, She stops, she stoops, she plucks a flower. She feels the ferment of the hour: She broodeth when the ringdove broods; The sun and flying clouds have power Upon her cheek and changing moods. She cannot think she is alone, As o'er her senses warmly steal Floods of unrest she fears to own, And almost dreads to feel. II Among the summer woodlands wide Anew she roams, no more alone; The joy she feared is at her side, Spring's blushing secret now is known. The primrose and its mates have flown, The thrush's ringing note hath died; But glancing eye and glowing tone Fall on her from her god, her guide. She knows not, asks not, what the goal, She only feels she moves towards bliss, And yields her pure unquestioning soul To touch and fondling kiss. III And still she haunts those woodland ways, Though all fond fancy finds there now To mind of spring or summer days, Are sodden trunk and songless bough. The past sits widowed on her brow: Homeward she wends with wintry gaze, To walls that house a hollow vow, To hearth where love hath ceased to blaze: Watches the clammy twilight wane, With grief too fixed for woe or tear; And, with her forehead 'gainst the pane, Envies the dying year. A WOMAN'S APOLOGY In the green darkness of a summer wood, Wherethro' ran winding ways, a lady stood, Carved from the air in curving womanhood. A maiden's form crowned by a matron's mien, As, about Lammas, wheat-stems may be seen, The ear all golden, but the stalk still green. There as she stood, waiting for sight or sound, Down a dim alley without break or bound, Slowly he came, his gaze upon the ground. Nor ever once he lifted up his eyes Till he no more her presence could disguise; Then he her face saluted silentwise. And silentwise no less she turned, as though She was the leaf and he the current's flow, And where he went, there she perforce must go. And both kept speechless as the dumb or dead, Nor did the earth so much as speak their tread, So soft by last year's leaves 'twas carpeted. And not a sound moved all the greenwood through, Save when some quest with fluttering wings outflew, Ruffling the leaves; then silence was anew. And when the track they followed forked in twain, They never doubted which one should be ta'en, But chose as though obeying secret rein. Until they came where boughs no longer screened The sky, and soon abruptly intervened A rustic gate, and over it they leaned. Leaned over it, and green before them lay A meadow ribbed with drying swathes of hay, From which the hinds had lately gone away. Beyond it, yet more woods, these too at rest, Smooth-dipping down to shore, unseen, but guessed; For lo! the Sea, with nothing on its breast. I âI was sure you would come,â she said, with a voice like a broken wing That flutters, and fails, then flags, while it nurses the failure's sting; âYou could not refuse me that, 'tis but such a little thing. II âDo I remember the words, the farewell words that you spoke, Answering soft with hard, ere we parted under the oak? Remember them? Can I forget? For each of them cut like a stroke. III âTrueâwere they true? You think so, or they had never been said; But somehow, like lightning flashes, they flickered about my head, Flickered but touched me not. They ought to have stricken me dead. IV âWhat do I want with you now? What I always wanted, you know; A voice to be heard in the darkness, a flower to be seen in the snow, And a bond linking each fresh future with a lengthening long-ago. V âIs it too much? Too little! Well, little or much, 'tis all That rescues my life from the nothing it seems to be when I call For a life to reply, and my voice comes back like a voice from the wall. VI âIf one played sweet on a lute, yea so soft that you scarce could hear, Would you clang all the chords with your hand that the octaves might ring out clear? Lo! asunder the strings are snapped, and the music shrinks silent for fear. VII âSee! the earth through the infinite spaces goes silently round and round, And the moon moveth on through the heavens and never maketh a sound, And the wheels of eternity traverse their journey in stillness profound. VIII â'Tis only the barren breakers that bellow on barren shore; 'Tis only the braggart thunders that rumble and rage and roar; Like a wave is the love that babbles; but silent love loves evermore. IX âFeeble, shadowy, shallow? Is ocean then shallow that keeps Its harvest of shell and seaweed that none or garners or reaps, That the diver may sound a moment, but never drag from its deeps? X âCowardice? Yes, we are cowards; cowards from cradle to bier, And the terror of life grows upon us as we grow year by year; Our smiles are but trembling ripples urged on by a subtide of fear. XI âAnd hence, or at substance or shadow we start, though we scarce know why. Life seems like a haunted wood, where we tremble and crouch and cry. Beast, or robber, or ghost,âour courage is still to fly. XII âSo we look around for a guide, and to place all our fears in his hand, That his courage may keep us brave, that his grandeur may make us grand: But, remember, a guide, not an ambush. Oh, tell me you understand! XIII âStill silent, still unpersuaded. Ah! I know what your thoughts repeat. We are all alike, and we love to keep passion aglow at our feet, Like one that sitteth in shade and complacently smiles at the heat. XIV âYou think so? Then come into shade. Rise up, take the seat at my side; Or, see, I will kneel, not you. What is humble, if this be pride? What seems cold now will chance feel warm when the fierce glare of noon hath died. XV âHave you never, when waves were breaking, watched children at sport on the beach, With their little feet tempting the foam-fringe, till with stronger and further reach Than they dreamed of, a billow comes bursting, how they turn and scamper and screech! XVI âAre we more than timider children? With its blending of terror and glee, To us lifeâcall it love, if you willâis a deep mysterious sea, That we play with till it grows earnest; then straight we tremble and flee. XVII âOh, never the pale east flushes with ripples of rising day, Never, never, the birds awakening sing loud upon gable and spray, But afresh you dawn on my life, and my soul chants its matin lay. XVIII âWhen the scent of the elder is wafted from the hedge in the cottage lane, Up the walk, and over the terrace, and in at the open pane, You are there, and my life seems perfumed like a garden after rain. XIX âThe nightingale brings you nearer, the woodpecker borrows your voice; The flower where the bees cling and cluster seems the flower of the flowers of your choice. I am sad with the cloud of your sadness, with the joy of your joy I rejoice. XX âWhat dearer, what nearer would you? Once heart is betrothed to heart, No closeness can bring them closer, no parting can put them apart. Oh! take all the balm, leave the bitter, give the sweetness with none of its smart.â The blue sea now had saddened into gray; Solid and close the darkening woodlands lay, And twilight's floating dews clung heavy with the hay. One with all these, he neither stirred nor spake, Though for a sound the silence seemed to ache, Waiting and wondering when his voice the pain would break. Then since the words hope forced despair to say Seemed to have vanished with the vanished day, She turned her from the gate, and slowly moved away. And he too turned; but pacing side by side, This mocking nearness did them more divide, Than if betwixt them moaned the round of ocean wide. But when o'erhead boughs once more met and spanned, She halted, laid upon his arm her hand, And questioned blank his face, his heart to understand. Had trust or tenderness been hovering there, She would have known it in the duskiest air; But face and form alike of every trace was bare. Her touch he neither welcomed nor repelled; Pulses that once had quickened straight seemed quelled; He stood like one that is by courteous bondage held. One hand thus foiled, the other rescuing came, And in the darkness sheltered against shame, She fawned on him with both, and trembled out his name. Then as a reaper, when the days are meet, His sickle curves about the bending wheat, He hollowed out his arms, and harvested his sweet. XXI âNow what shall I cling to?â she murmured, âBehold! I am weak, you are strong. Brief, brief is the bridal of summer, the mourning of winter is long; Never leave me unloved to discover love's right was but rapturous wrong!â Again was silence. Then she slowly felt The clasp of cruel fondness round her melt, And heard a voice that seemed the voice of one that knelt. âThe long, long mourning of the winter days Waits sure for them that bask in summer rays; One must depart, then life is death to one that stays. âThis fixed decree we can nor change nor cheat; For I must either leave or lose you, sweet, And all love's triumphs end in death and dark defeat. âDeath is unconscious change, change conscious death. Better to die outright than gasp for breath. Life, dead, hath done with pain; Love, lingering, suffereth. âThe only lossâand this may you be spared!â For which who stake on love must be prepared, Is still that, though life may, yet death can not be shared. âNo other pain shall come to you from me. What love withholds, love needs must ask. But, see! Since you embrace love's chains, love's self doth set you free.â So free they wandered, drinking with delight The scented silence of the summer night, And in the darkness saw what ne'er is seen in light. Hushed deep in slumber seemed all earthy jars, And, looking up, they saw, 'twixt leafy bars, The untrod fields of Heaven glistening with dewy stars. THE DEATH OF HUSS In the streets of Constance was heard the shout, âMasters! bring the arch-heretic out!â The stake had been planted, the faggots spread, And the tongues of the torches flickered red. âHuss to the flames!â they fiercely cried: Then the gate of the Convent opened wide. Into the sun from the dark he came, His face as fixed as a face in a frame. His arms were pinioned, but you could see, By the smile round his mouth, that his soul was free; And his eye with a strange bright glow was lit, Like a star just before the dawn quencheth it. To the pyre the crowd a pathway made, And he walked along it with no man's aid; Steadily on to the place he trod, Commending aloud his soul to God. Aloud he prayed, though they mocked his prayer: He was the only thing tranquil there. But, seeing the faggots, he quickened pace, As we do when we see the loved one's face. âNow, now, let the torch in the resin flare, Till my books and body be ashes and air! But the spirit of both shall return to men, As dew that rises descends again.â From the back of the crowd where the women wept, And the children whispered, a peasant stepped. A goodly faggot was on his back, Brittle and sere, from last year's stack; And he placed it carefully where the torch Was sure to lick and the flame to scorch. âWhy bring you fresh fuel, friend? Here are sticks To burn up a score of heretics.â Answered the peasant, âBecause this year, My hearth will be cold, for is firewood dear; And Heaven be witness I pay my toll, And burn your body to save my soul.â Huss gazed at the peasant, he gazed at the pile, Then over his features there stole a smile. âO Sancta Simplicitas! By God's troth, This faggot of yours may save us both, And He who judgeth perchance prefer To the victim the executioner!â Then unto the stake was he tightly tied, And the torches were lowered and thrust inside. You could hear the twigs crackle and sputter the flesh, Then âSancta Simplicitas!â moaned afresh. 'Twas the last men heard of the words he spoke, Ere to Heaven his soul went up with the smoke. THE LAST REDOUBT I Kacelyevo's slope still felt The cannon's bolt and the rifles' pelt; For a last redoubt up the hill remained, By the Russ yet held, by the Turk not gained. II Mehemet Ali stroked his beard; His lips were clinched and his look was weird; Round him were ranks of his ragged folk, Their faces blackened with blood and smoke. III âClear me the Muscovite out!â he cried, Then the name of âAllah!â resounded wide, And the rifles were clutched and the bayonets lowered, And on to the last redoubt they poured. IV One fell, and a second quickly stopped The gap that he left when he reeled and dropped; The second,âa third straight filled his place; The third,âand a fourth kept up the race. V Many a fez in the mud was crushed, Many a throat that cheered was hushed, Many a heart that sought the crest Found Allah's throne and a houri's breast. VI Over their corpses the living sprang, And the ridge with their musket-rattle rang, Till the faces that lined the last redoubt Could see their faces and hear their shout. VII In the redoubt a fair form towered, That cheered up the brave and chid the coward; Brandishing blade with a gallant air, His head erect and his temples bare. VIII âFly! they are on us!â his men implored; But he waved them on with his waving sword. âIt cannot be held; 'tis no shame to go!â But he stood with his face set hard to the foe. IX Then clung they about him, and tugged, and knelt. He drew a pistol out from his belt, And fired it blank at the first that set Foot on the edge of the parapet. X Over, that first one toppled; but on Clambered the rest till their bayonets shone, As hurriedly fled his men dismayed, Not a bayonet's length from the length of his blade. XI âYield!â But aloft his steel he flashed, And down on their steel it ringing clashed; Then back he reeled with a bladeless hilt, His honour full, but his life-blood spilt. XII Mehemet Ali came and saw The riddled breast and the tender jaw. âMake him a bier of your arms,â he said, âAnd daintily bury this dainty dead!â XIII They lifted him up from the dabbled ground; His limbs were shapely, and soft, and round. No down on his lip, on his cheek no shade:â âBismillah!â they cried, â'tis an Infidel maid!â XIV âDig her a grave where she stood and fell, 'Gainst the jackal's scratch and the vulture's smell. Did the Muscovite men like their maidens fight, In their lines we had scarcely supped to-night.â XV So a deeper trench 'mong the trenches there Was dug, for the form as brave as fair; And none, till the Judgment trump and shout, Shall drive her out of the Last Redoubt. OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE CHURCH I âThe old Church doors stand open wide, Though neither bells nor anthems peal. Gazing so fondly from outside, Why do you enter not and kneel? II âIt is the sunset hour when all Begin to feel the need to pray, Upon our common Father call To guard the night, condone the day. III âIs it proud scorn, or humble doubt, That keeps you standing, lingering, there; Half in the Church, and half without, Midway betwixt the world and prayer? IV âNo meeter moment could there be For man to talk alone with God. The careless sexton has, you see, Shouldered his spade, and homeward trod. V âThe Vicar's daily round is done; His back just sank below the brow. He passed the porches, one by one, That line the hamlet street, and now VI âHe, in his garden, cons the page, And muses on to-morrow's text. The homebound rustic counts his wage, The same last week, the same the next. VII âNor priest nor hind are you, but each Alike is welcome here within; Both they who learn, and they who teach, Have secret sorrow, secret sin. VIII âEnter, and bare your inmost sore; Enter, and weep your stain away; Leave doubt and darkness at the door; Come in and kneel, come in and pray.â IX Such were the words I seemed to hear, By no one uttered, but alack! The voice of many a bygone year, Striking the church, and echoing back. X I entered not, but on a stone Sate, that recorded some one's loss; But name and date no more were shown, The deep-cut lines were smooth with moss. XI Below were longsome tags of rhyme, But what, you could not now surmise. Alas! alas! that death and time Should overgrow love's eulogies. XII Round me was Death that plainly spoke The hopes and aims that life denied; The curious pomp of simple folk, The pedantry of rustic pride. XIII Some slept in square sepulchral caves, Some were stretched flat, and some inurned; And there were fresh brown baby graves, Resembling cradles overturned. XIV From where I sate I still could watch The old oak pews, the altar white. Gable and oasthouse, tile and thatch, Smiled softly in the sunset light. XV From here and there a cottage roof, Spires of blue vapour 'gan to steal; To eyes of love a heavenly proof The mother warmed the evening meal. XVI No more the mill-stream chafed and churned; The wheel hung still, the meal lay whole; From marsh and dyke the rooks returned, And circled round and round the toll. XVII The lambs were mute, the sheep were couched, The hop-poles bent 'neath leaf and bine; Adown the road the vagrant slouched, And glanced up at the alehouse sign. XVIII Again I heard the unseen voice: âWhy do you come not in and rest? Whether you grieve or you rejoice, You here will be a welcome guest. XIX âTo Heaven it is the half-way house, Where hope can feed, and anguish may Recline its limbs and rest its brows, With simple thanks for ample pay. XX âWas it not here you got the name Which is of you so close a part, That, uttered, it hath magic claim To flush love's cheek, to flood love's heart? XXI âHere too it was, when youth confessed The weariness of random ways, And felt a surging in the breast For faithful nights and fruitful days, XXII âYou came with one who, conquering fear When love surprised first thought to fly, Acknowledged with a tender tear The sweetness of captivity. XXIII âAnd here 'twill be when you have ta'en Last look of love, last look of Spring, When hearts for you will yearn in vain, And vain for you the birds will sing, XXIV âThat shuffling feet and slow will come, With cumbrous coffin, gloomy pall, And, while within you moulder dumb, That prayers will rise and tears will fall. XXV âAnd should Death haply prove your friend, And what in life was scorned should save, Hither it is that feet will wend, To read the name upon your grave.â XXVI I heard the voice no more. The rooks Had ceased to float, had ceased to caw; The sunlight lingered but in nooks, And, gazing toward the west, I saw, XXVII Beyond the pasture's withered bents, Upstanding hop, recumbent fleece, And sheaves of wheat, like weathered tents, A twilight bivouac of peace. XXVIII Into itself the voice withdrew. A something subtle all around Came floating on the rising dew, And sweetness took the place of sound. XXIX No word of mine, although my heart Rebelled, the scented stillness shook; But silence seemed to take my part, Thus mildly answering mild rebuke: XXX â'Tis true I have to you not brought My eager or despondent mood, But still by wood and stream have sought The sanctity of solitude. XXXI âBut as a youth who quits his home To range in tracts of freÃ«r fame, However far or wide he roam, Dwells fondly on his mother's name; XXXII âSo bear me witness, dear old Church, Although apart our ritual be, I ne'er have breathed one word to smirch The Creed that bore and suckled me. XXXIII âNot mine presumptuous thought to cope With sage's faith, with saint's belief, Or proudly mock the humble hope That solaced the Repentant Thief. XXXIV âI do not let the elms, that shut My garden in from world without, Exclude your sacred presence, but I lop them when they shoot and sprout; XXXV âThat I at eve, that I at dawn, That I, when noons are warm and still, Lying or lingering on the lawn, May see your tower upon the hill. XXXVI âBut when Faith grows a sophist's theme, And chancels ring with doubt and din, I sometimes think that they who seem The most without, are most within. XXXVII âThe name you gave, that name I bear; The bond you sealed, I sacred keep; And, when my brain is dust and air, Let me within your precincts sleep.â XXXVIII The sexton came and scanned once more The neat square pit of smooth blue clay, Then turned the key and locked the door, And so, like him, I went my way. XXXIX I had the summons not obeyed; I had nor knelt nor uttered word; But somehow felt that I had prayed, And somehow felt I had been heard. AT SAN GIOVANNI DEL LAGO I I leaned upon the rustic bridge, And watched the streamlet make Its chattering way past zigzag ridge Down to the silent lake. II The sunlight flickered on the wave, Lay quiet on the hill; Italian sunshine, bright and brave, Though 'twas but April still. III I heard the distant shepherd's shout, I heard the fisher's call; The lizards glistened in and out, Along the crannied wall. IV Hard-by, in rudely frescoed niche, Hung Christ upon the tree; Round Him the Maries knelt, and each Was weeping bitterly. V A nightingale from out the trees Rippled, and then was dumb; But in the golden bays the bees Kept up a constant hum. VI Two peasant women of the land, Barefoot, with tresses black, Came slowly toward me from the strand, With their burdens on their back: VII Two wicker crates with linen piled, Just newly washed and wrung; And, close behind, a little child That made the morning young. VIII Reaching the bridge, each doffed her load, Resting before they clomb, Along the stony twisting road, Up to their mountain home. IX Shortly the child, just half its height, Stooped 'neath her mother's pack, And strove and strove with all her might To lift it on her back. X Thereat my heart began to smile: Haply I speak their tongue: âCan you,â I said, ânot wait awhile? You won't be always young. XI âWhy long to share the toil you see, Why hurry on the years, When life will one long season be Of labour and of tears? XII âBe patient with your childhood. Work Will come full soon enough. From year to year, from morn till murk, Life will be hard and rough. XIII âAnd yours will grow, and haply I, Revisiting this shore, In years to come will see and sigh You are a child no more. XIV âYours then will be the moil, the heat, Yours be the strain and stress. Pray Heaven Love then attend your feet To make life's burden less.â XV Thus as I spoke, with steadfast stare She clung between the two, Scarce understanding, yet aware That the sad words were true. XVI Down from the mother's face a tear Fell to her naked feet. âBut now unto the Signor, dear, Your poesy repeat.â XVII Without demur the little maid Spread out her palms, and lo! From lips that lisped, yet unafraid, Sweet verse began to flow. XVIII She told the story that we all Learn at our mother's knee, Of Eve's transgression, Adam's fall, And Heaven's great clemency: XIX How Jesus was by Mary's hands In the rough manger laid, And by rich Kings from far-off lands Was pious homage paid: XX Then how, though cruel Herod slew The suckling babes, and thought To baffle God, Christ lived and grew, And in the temple taught. XXI She raised her hands to suit the rhyme, She clasped them on her heart; There never lived the city mime So well had played the part. XXII When she broke off, I was too choked With tenderness to speak. And so her little form I stroked, And kissed her on the cheek; XXIII And took a sweetmeat that I had, And put it in her mouth. O then she danced like a stream that's glad When it hurries to the south. XXIV She danced, she skipped, she kissed âgood-bye,â She frolicked round and round: The pair resumed their packs, and I Sate rooted to the ground. XXV âA rivederla!â Then the three Went winding up the hill. Ah! they have long forgotten me; But I remember still. Bellagio. NATURE AND THE BOOK I I closed the book. The summer shower In smiling dimples ebbed away, But still on leaf, and blade, and flower, The fallen raindrops glistening lay. II I placed the volume on the shelf, And, issuing from the leafy shed, Paced the moist garden by myself, Musing on what I just had read: III That Man should live by Nature's laws, And that his ways are waste and wild, Unless he follow where she draws, Cling to her skirts, and be her child: IV That love, and dread, and doubt are dreams, But dwindling specks in widening space, Nor shall we ever pierce what seems, Or find a soul behind the face; V That if man will but ask the air, Question the earth, consult the skies, He needs no help of awe or prayer, Or further wisdom, to be wise. VI The sun had dried the garden seat; The tall lithe flax nor bent nor swayed; The tassels of the lime smelt sweet Within the circle of its shade. VII The heavy bees from out the hive Came slowly answering to the sun; I watched them hover, and then dive Into the foxgloves, one by one. VIII Shortly a butcher-bird shot by, Then doubled back, and upward flew, Chasing a sulphur butterfly To whom the earth and air were new. IX Oft it escapedâescaped again,â But, each time, feebler swerved and rose; Till flagged the flying flower, and then I saw not, but could guess, the close. X Anon a hawk, intent to strike, In the blue ether hovering brown, Flickered an instant, and, then like Returning arrow, quickened down. XI What! Has he missed? No, bravely done! A whirr of wings, a silenced shriek. Off skimmed the coveyâall save one, Left in tight claw and rending beak. XII And are these then the laws that I Must copy with a docile will? Am I to suck each sweetness dry? Am I to harry and to kill? XIII If Nature is to be my guide, I doubt her fitness for the part, Rebuke her ruthlessness, and chide Her lack of soul, her want of heart. XIV I chafe within the cage of law; The realm of chance far sweeter is. I own no love, I feel no awe, For causes and for sequences. XV Doth Nature draw me, 'tis because, Unto my seeming, there doth lurk A lawlessness about her laws, More mood than purpose in her work. XVI The Spring-time will not come to date; Winds, clouds, and frosts, man's reckoning mar. For bud and bloom you have to wait, Despite your ordered calendar. XVII If Nature built by rule and square, Than man what wiser would she be? What wins us is her careless care, And sweet unpunctuality. XVIII They misconstrue her, who translate. They blur her mirror with their mist. âBehold,â one says, âthe face of Fate,â Because himself a fatalist. XIX Another, coming, cries âBehold The aspect of a veering will! The Gods are weak, the Gods are oldââ Fools! you are older, weaker still. XX In vain would science scan and trace Firmly her aspect. All the while, There gleams upon her far-off face A vague unfathomable smile. XXI Only the poet reads her right, Because he reads with heart, not eyes: He bares his being in her sight, And mirrors all her mysteries. XXII While others scan some favourite part Of Nature, he reflects the whole, Has every climate in his heart, And all the seasons in his soul. XXIII While she upon herself revolves, He only her whole sphere can see, And in that prism, his mind, resolves The fragments of her unity. XXIV He bids her not to him conform, He does not question her intent; He takes the sunshine and the storm As strings of some sweet instrument; XXV And out of these, and every mood That in her lurks, makes music flow, And fledges Fancy's happy brood E'en from the very nest of woe. XXVI He loves her, hence doth not demand That she be better or be worse, But links with his her helpful hand, And weds her beauty to his verse. XXVII He loves her more, as grow the years; Her faults are virtues in his eyes; He drinks, with her, Spring's wayward tears, With her, shares Winter's wasted sighs. XXVIII She waited for him till he came; Though he departs, she doth survive, And, fondly careful of his fame, Through hers she keeps his name alive. XXIX From sunny woof and cloudy weft Fell rain in sheets; so, to myself I hummed these hazard rhymes, and left The learnÃ«d volume on the shelf. AT SHELLEY'S HOUSE AT LERICI I Maiden, with English hair, and eyes The colour of Italian skies, What seek you by this shore? âI seek, sir, for the latest home Where Shelley dwelt, and, o'er the foam Speeding, returned no more.â II Come, then, with me: I seek it, too. Are you his kith? For strangely you Resemble him in mien. âNo, save it be that all are kin Who cherish the same thoughts within, And gaze on things unseen.â III It should be easy, sure, to find. Waves close in front, woods close behind, Green shutters, whitewashed walls; A little space of rocky ground, Where climbs the wave, and, round and round The seagull curves and calls. IV Lo! there it stands. A quiet spot, Untenanted, it seems forgot, Like shrine from which the God Hath vanished, and but left behind A something in the air, the wind, Recalling where he trod. V Upon this balcony how oft, When waves were smooth and winds were soft, As now, he must have stood, And dreamed of days when men should be Bondless as this unfettered sea, And peaceful as that wood. VI What would he find if came he now? A phantom crown on kingly brow, Veiled sceptre, trembling throne; Pulpits where threat and curse have ceased, And shrines whereat half-sceptic priest Worships, too oft, alone. VII With muffled psalm and whispered hymn, At secret dawn or twilight dim, A pious remnant pray; For their maimed rites indulgence plead, And, half uncertain of their creed, Explain their God away. VIII Gone the conventions Shelley cursed: The first are last, the last are first; The lame, the halt, the blind, Now in the seat of power, along With the far-seeing and the strong, Mould mandates for mankind. IX No longer doth man's will decide, And woman's feebler impulse guide; He yields to her his might: Duty hath grown an old-world tale, And chaste Obedience rends her veil, For epicene delight. X Where now do towering despots reign Over lithe knee and servile brain, The scared, the base, the bought? Monarchs themselves now bend with awe Before the kingliness of Law, The majesty of Thought. XI Yes, Kings have gone, or reign as slaves; Religion mumbles round our graves, But shapes our lives no more: Tradition, thrice-spurned Sibyl, burns The leaves mob Sovereignty spurns, Contemptuous of her lore. XII Fair Maiden with the sea-blue eyes, With whom, beneath these sea-blue skies, Shelley had loved to live, Forgive me if his dream, unborn Then, but now adult, moves my scorn: Would He too not forgive? XIII For where both Crown and Cowl defied Sue for the ruth they once denied, What would he find instead? A fiercer despot, fouler creed, The Rule of Gold, the rites of Greed, And a bitterer cry for bread. XIV Wake, poet! and retune your strings. The earth now swarms with petty kings, Seated on self-made thrones, And altar-tables richly spread, Where Roguery consecrates the bread, And Opulence atones. XV Here Shelley prayed that War might cease From earth, and Pentecostal Peace Descend with dovelike breath. Look round this bay! each treeless gorge, Each scarred ravine, incessant forge The instruments of death. XVI From Salterbrand's unfreezing peaks To sunny Manfredonia's creeks, Have alien satraps gone; But, guarding Italy the Free, Her murderous mammoth-monsters, see, Come grimly wallowing on. XVII Yes, here He dwelt and dreamed: and there, Gleams Porto Venere the fair, The mockery of a name. Where fervent Venus once was Queen, Hot Mars now ravishes the scene, And fans a fiercer flame. The Bay of Spezia is now one vast arsenal, and one of the chief anchorages of the Italian Ironclad Squadron. XVIII Fair Maiden with the English brow, Although from me, who shortly now Must tread life's downward slope, Illusions one by one depart, Still foster in your virgin heart The embryo of Hope. XIX The hills remain, the woods, the waves; And they alone are dupes or slaves Who, spurning Nature's breast, Too high would soar, too deep would sound, And madden vainly round and round The orbit of unrest. XX Pity, too, lingers. As I speak, The teardrops tremble on your cheek, Too silent to deceive; And with assuaging hand you show How tenderness still tempers woe, And none need singly grieve. XXI Yes! sweet it were, with you for guide, To float across that dimpling tide, And, on its farther shore, To prove if Venus still holds sway, And, wandering with you round the bay, Tempt back one's youth once more. XXII But, child! it is not Shelley's world. Fancy's light sails had best be furled, Before they surge and swell. What helm can steer the heart? or who Keep moored, inspired by such as You? Heaven prosper you! Farewell. AT THE GATE OF THE CONVENT I Beside the Convent Gate I stood, Lingering to take farewell of those To whom I owed the simple good Of three days' peace, three nights' repose. II My sumpter-mule did blink and blink; Was nothing more to munch or quaff; Antonio, far too wise to think, Leaned vacantly upon his staff. III It was the childhood of the year: Bright was the morning, blithe the air; And in the choir I plain could hear The monks still chanting matin prayer. IV The throstle and the blackbird shrilled, Loudly as in an English copse, Fountain-like note that, still refilled, Rises and falls, but never stops. V As lush as in an English chase, The hawthorn, guessed by its perfume, With folds on folds of snowy lace Blindfolded all its leaves with bloom. VI Scarce seen, and only faintly heard, A torrent, 'mid far snow-peaks born, Sang kindred with the gurgling bird, Flowed kindred with the foaming thorn. VII The chanting ceased, and soon instead Came shuffling sound of sandalled shoon; Each to his cell and narrow bed Withdrew, to pray and muse till noon. VIII Only the Priorâfor such their Ruleâ Into the morning sunshine came. Antonio bared his locks; the mule Kept blinking, blinking, just the same. IX I thanked him with a faltering tongue; I thanked him with a flowing heart. âThis for the poor.â His hand I wrung, And gave the signal to depart. X But still in his he held my hand, As though averse that I should go. His brow was grave, his look was bland, His beard was white as Alpine snow. XI And in his eye a light there shone, A soft, subdued, but steadfast ray, Like to those lamps that still burn on In shrines where no one comes to pray. XII And in his voice I seemed to hear The hymns that novice-sisters sing, When only anguished Christ is near, And earth and life seem vanishing. XIII âWhy do you leave us, dear my son? Why from calm cloisters backward wend, Where moil is much and peace is none, And journeying hath nor bourne nor end? XIV âRead I your inmost soul aright, Heaven hath to you been strangely kind; Gave gentle cradle, boyhood bright, A fostered soul, a tutored mind. XV âNor wealth did lure, nor penury cramp, Your ripening soul; it lived and throve, Nightly beside the lettered lamp, Daily in field, and glade, and grove. XVI âAnd when the dawn of manhood brought The hour to choose to be of those Who serve for gold, or sway by thought, You doubted not, and rightly chose. XVII âLoving your Land, you face the strife; Loved by the Muse, you shun the throng; And blend within your dual life The patriot's pen, the poet's song. XVIII âHence now, in gaze mature and wise, Dwells scorn of praise, dwells scorn of blame; Calm consciousness of surer prize Than dying noise of living fame. XIX âHave you not loved, been loved, as few Love, or are loved, on loveless earth? How often have you felt its dew? Say, have you ever known its dearth? XX âI speak of love divorced from pelf, I speak of love unyoked and free, Of love that deadens sense of self, Of love that loveth utterly. XXI âAnd this along your life hath flowed In full and never-failing stream, Fresh from its source, unbought, unowed, Beyond your boyhood's fondest dream.â XXII He paused. The cuckoo called. I thought Of English voices, English trees. The far-off fancy instant brought The tears; and he, misled by these, XXIII With hand upon my shoulder, said, âYou own 'tis true. The richest years Bequeath the beggared heart, when fled, Only this legacy of tears. XXIV âWhy is it that all raptures cloy? Though men extol, though women bless, Why are we still chagrined with joy, Dissatisfied with happiness? XXV âYes, the care-flouting cuckoo calls, And yet your smile betokens grief, Like meditative light that falls Through branches fringed with autumn leaf. XXVI âWhence comes this shadow? You are now In the full summer of the soul. The answer darkens on your brow: âWinter the end, and death the goal.â XXVII âYes, vain the fires of pride and lust Fierce in meridian pulses burn: Remember, Man, that thou art dust, And unto dust thou shalt return. XXVIII âRude are our walls, our beds are rough, But use is hardship's subtle friend. He hath got all that hath enough; And rough feels softest, in the end. XXIX âWhile luxury hath this disease, It ever craves and pushes on. Pleasures, repeated, cease to please, And rapture, once 'tis reaped, is gone. XXX âMy flesh hath long since ceased to creep, Although the hairshirt pricketh oft. A plank my couch; withal, I sleep Soundly as he that lieth soft. XXXI âAnd meagre though may be the meal That decks the simple board you see, At least, my son, we never feel The hunger of satiety. XXXII âYou have perhaps discreetly drunk: O, then, discreetly, drink no more! Which is the happier, worldling, monk, When youth is past, and manhood o'er? XXXIII âOf life beyond I speak not yet. 'Tis solitude alone can e'er, By hushing controversy, let Man catch earth's undertone of prayer. XXXIV âYour soul which Heaven at last must reap, From too much noise hath barren grown; Long fallow silence must it keep, Ere faith revive, and grace be sown. XXXV âLet guide and mule alone return. For you I will prepare a cell, In whose calm silence you will learn, Living or dying, All is well!â XXXVI Again the cuckoo called; again The merle and mavis shook their throats; The torrent rambled down the glen, The ringdove cooed in sylvan cotes. XXXVII The hawthorn moved not, but still kept As fixedly white as far cascade; The russet squirrel frisked and leapt From breadth of sheen to breadth of shade. XXXVIII I did not know the words had ceased, I thought that he was speaking still, Nor had distinguished sacred priest From pagan thorn, from pagan rill. XXXIX Not that I had not harked and heard; But all he bade me shun or do, Seemed just as sweet as warbling bird, But not more grave and not more true. XL So deep yet indistinct my bliss, That when his counsels ceased to sound, That one sweet note I did not miss From other sweet notes all around. XLI But he, misreading my delight, Again with urging accents spoke. Then I, like one that's touched at night, From the deep swoon of sweetness woke. XLII And just as one that, waking, can Recall the thing he dreamed, but knows 'Twas of the phantom world that man Visits in languors of repose; XLIII So, though I straight repictured plain All he had said, it seemed to me, Recalled from slumber, to retain No kinship with reality. XLIV âFather, forgive!â I said; âand look! Who taught its carolling to the merle? Who wed the music to the brook? Who decked the thorn with flakes of pearl? XLV â'Twas He, you answer, that did make Earth, sea, and sky: He maketh all; The gleeful notes that flood the brake, The sad notes wailed in Convent stall. XLVI âAnd my poor voice He also made; And like the brook, and like the bird, And like your brethren mute and staid, I too can but fulfil His word. XLVII âWere I about my loins to tie A girdle, and to hold in scorn Beauty and Love, what then were I But songless stream, but flowerless thorn? XLVIII âWhy do our senses love to list When distant cataracts murmur thus? Why stealeth o'er your eyes a mist When belfries toll the Angelus? XLIX âIt is that every tender sound Art can evoke, or Nature yield, Betokens something more profound, Hinted, but never quite revealed. L âAnd though it be the self-same Hand That doth the complex concert strike, The notes, to those that understand, Are individual, and unlike. LI âAllow my nature. All things are, If true to instinct, well and wise. The dewdrop hinders not the star; The waves do not rebuke the skies. LII âSo leave me free, good Father dear, While you on humbler, holier chord Chant your secluded Vespers here, To fling my matin notes abroad. LIII âWhile you with sacred sandals wend To trim the lamp, to deck the shrine, Let me my country's altar tend, Nor deem such worship less divine. LIV âMine earthly, yours celestial love: Each hath its harvest; both are sweet. You wait to reap your Heaven, above; I reap the Heaven about my feet. LV âAnd what if Iâforgive your guest Who feels, so frankly speaks, his qualmâ Though calm amid the world's unrest, Should restless be amid your calm? LVI âBut though we two be severed quite, Your holy words will sound between Our lives, like stream one hears at night, Louder, because it is not seen. LVII âFather, farewell! Be not distressed; And take my vow, ere I depart, To found a Convent in my breast, And keep a cloister in my heart.â LVIII The mule from off his ribs a fly Flicked, and then zigzagged down the road. Antonio lit his pipe, and I Behind them somewhat sadly strode. LIX Just ere the Convent dipped from view, Backward I glanced: he was not there. Within the chapel, well I knew, His lips were now composed in prayer. LX But I have kept my vow. And when The cuckoo chuckleth o'er his theft, When throstles sing, again, again, And runnels gambol down the cleft, LXI With these I roam, I sing with those, And should the world with smiles or jeers Provoke or lure, my lids I close, And draw a cowl about my ears. BROTHER BENEDICT I Brother Benedict rose and left his cell With the last slow swing of the evening bell. In his hand he carried his only book, And he followed the path to the Abbey brook, And, crossing the stepping-stones, paused midway, For the journeying water seemed to say, Benedicite. II But when he stood on the other bank, The flags rose tall, and the grass grew rank, And the sorrel red and the white meadow-sweet Shook their dust on his sandalled feet, And, lifting their heads where his girdle hung, Would surely have said had they found a tongue, Benedicite. III Onward and upward he clomb and wound, Bruising the thyme on the nibbled ground Here and there, in the untrimmed brake, The dog-rose bloomed for its own sweet sake; The woodbine clambered up out of reach, But the scent of them all breathed as plain as speech, Benedicite. IV Shortly he came to a leafy nook, Where wind never entered nor branch ever shook. Itself was the only thing in sight, And the rest of the world was shut out quite. 'Twas as self-contained as the holy place Where the children quire with upturned face, Benedicite. V A dell so curtained with trunks and boughs, That in hours when the ringdove coos to his spouse, The sun to its heart scarce a way could win. But the trees now had drawn all their shadows in; There was nothing but scent in the dewy air, And the silence seemed saying in mental prayer, Benedicite. VI 'Gainst the trunk of a beech, round, smooth, and gray, Brother Benedict leaned, with intent to pray, And opened his book: with vellum bound; Within, red letters on faded ground; Pater, and Ave, and saving Creed:â But look where you would, you seemed to read, Benedicite. VII He scarce had a verse of his office said, Ere a bird in the branches overhead Began to warble so sweet a strain, That, strive as he would, still he strove in vain To close his ears; so he closed his book, While the unseen throat to the air outshook Benedicite. VIII 'Twas a song that rippled, and revelled, and ran Ever back to the note whence it began; Rising, and falling, and never did stay, Like a fountain that feeds on itself all day, Wanting no answer, answering none, But beginning again as each verse was done, Benedicite. IX It brought an ecstasy into his face, It weaned his senses from time and space, It carried him off to worlds unseen, And showed him what is not and ne'er has been, Transporting his soul to those realms of calm, More blessÃ«d and blessing than even the psalm, Benedicite. X Then, carolling still, it drew him thence Slowly back to the spheres of sense, But held him awhile where self expires, And vague recollections and vague desires Banish the burden of things that are, And angels seem canticling, faint and far, Benedicite. XI Then across him there flitted the days that are dead, And those that will follow when these are fled; Generations of sorrow, wave after wave, With their samesome journey from womb to grave; Men's love of the fleshly sweets that sting, And the comfort that comes when we kneel and sing, Benedicite. XII He suddenly started and gazed around, For silence can waken as well as sound, And the bird had ceased singing. The dewy air Still was immersed in mental prayer. Time seemed to have stopped. So he quickened pace, But forgot not to say ere he left the lone place, Benedicite. XIII Downward he wended, and under his feet, As on mounting, the bruised thyme answered sweet; As before, in the brake the dog-rose bloomed, And the woodbine with fragrance the hedge perfumed; And the white meadow-sweet and the sorrel red, Had they found a tongue, would still surely have said, Benedicite. XIV But where were the flags and the tall rank grass, And the stepping-stones smooth for his feet to pass? Were they swept away? Did he wake or dream? A bridge that he knew not spanned the stream; Though under its archway he still could hear The journeying water purling clear, Benedicite. XV Where had he wandered? This never could Be the spot where the Abbey orchard stood? Where the filberts once mellowed, lay tumbled blocks, And cherry stumps peered through tares and docks; A rough plot stretched where in times gone by The plump apples dropped to the joyous cry, Benedicite. XVI The gateway had vanished, the portal flown, The walls of the Abbey were ivy-grown; The arches were shattered, the roof was gone, The mullions were mouldering one by one; Wrecked was the oriel's tracery light That the sun streamed through when they met to recite Benedicite. XVII Chancel and choir and nave and aisle Were but one ruinous vacant pile. So utter the havoc, you could not tell Which was corridor, cloister, cell. Cow-grass, and foxglove, and waving weed, Covered the scrolls where you used to read, Benedicite. XVIII High up where of old the belfry towered, An elder had rooted and whitely flowered: Surviving ruin and rain and wind, Below it a lichened gurgoyle grinned. Though birds were chirping and flitting about, They paused not to treble the anthem devout, Benedicite. XIX Then he went where the Abbot was wont to lay His children to rest till the Judgment Day, And at length in the grass the name he found Of a friar he fancied alive and sound. The slab was hoary, the carving blurred, And he rather guessed than could read the word, Benedicite. XX He sate him down on a fretted stone, Where rains had beaten and winds had blown, And opened his office-book, and read The prayers that we read for our loved ones dead, While nightfall crept on the twilight air, And darkened the page of the final prayer, Benedicite. XXI But to murkiest gloom when the gloaming did wane, In the air there still floated a shadowy strain. 'Twas distilled with the dew, it was showered from the star, It was murmuring near, it was tingling afar; In silence it sounded, in darkness it shone, And in sleep that is deepest it wakeful dreamed on, Benedicite. XXII Do you ask what had witched Brother Benedict's ears? The bird had been singing a thousand years: Sweetly confounding in its sweet lay To-day, to-morrow, and yesterday. Time? What is Time but a fiction vain, To him that o'erhears the Eternal strain, Benedicite?</field>
