TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND, K. G., &amp;c., THE FOLLOWING CHRONICLE OF HIS GRACE'S NOBLE ANCESTRY, IS, WITH PERMISSION, INSCRIBED BY THE PUBLISHER. Here followeth y? Coppy of an ould parchment booke devided into seaven lines, and seaven of the pedegrees lives &amp; deathes of the Percies from fower discents afore the Conquest to y? Earles sone y? was kild by the Co?ons at Thirsk in Henry the vij?? his tyme. It is in ffolio &amp; conteines eight leaves of parchm? whereof the first word is (here) &amp; the first lettre beeinge (H) is a greate red lettre &amp; is in length from y? ffirst line to the seaventh line. Now followeth y? booke conteininge 76 Devisions of Seven lines. Here beginneth the Prologue of this litle treaties followinge w?? is ye discent of the Lord Percies made &amp; compiled briefely by mee W? Peeris Clerke &amp; Priest. Secretary to the Right noble Earle Henry the V?? earle of Northumberland. Chronickles &amp; Annuall bookes of Kings Of ancient Lords &amp; estates royall. Declareth y? descent w?? many notable things theire fatall ends and theire Acts martiall. Yet a true descent &amp; Linage spetiall, in diverse places confused in the bookes it is hard to find but if a longe looke. Wherefore I have concluded rudely as I can In a perpetuall memory for a President Of the noble Pearcy bloud maintainer of many a man Here to entitle of ancient proofe evident. Soe liberall a linage, a stocke soe reuerent soe prepotent a progenie of noble blood descended ought to bee registred, remembred, &amp; penned. To yo? good Lordship my owne good Lord This litle poore Treatise I combined An infallible witnesse &amp; a true record of my true heart &amp; faithfull mind To yo? good Lordship soe bounteous &amp; kind where pow? wanteth &amp; fortunes smilinge face onely good will supplyeth the place. A poore widdowe saith holy scripture the vallew of a farthinge offred up and sent W?? harty devotion &amp; mind right pure Of Christ shee was commended for her good intent. W?? a mans true heart hee is best content Give mee thy hart man saith hee it is enough a poore man god knoweth hath none other plough. If soe litle a thinge may bee acceptable I have given it yo? Lordship an hundred fould Would god my litle cunninge were able To doe yo? such service as I would. But my hart is yo?? untill my carcasse be could If privy envy the contrary say it shall neuer bee proved untill my deaths day. The most radiant sone of Righteousnes y? euer cleard yo? W?? is neuer ecclipsed nor lacketh light Give yo? good Lordship many good yeares &amp; send yo? L?ship grace &amp; spetiall might To ouercome yo? enemies &amp; longe to enjoy yo? right This day this poore New yeares gift to yo? L?ship I present of harty good mynd and true humble intent. And how bee it this matter be compiled w??out science or art I beseech yo? good Lordship to accept the goodwill &amp; ponder the true stedfast hart. Afore the Conquest many yeares revolved The yeares of our lord nine hundred thirtie &amp; three the fourth yeare of kinge Alured of England obtaininge the monarchie As in the second booke of William Malmesbury Cronicles is remembred the progenito?? of y? Percies of stocke ancient in the Countrey Of Denmarke &amp; Norway flowred in high felicity &amp; doubtles they were of great nobility &amp; w?? famous Duke Rollo out of the said Countrey they came when hee tooke his jorney to conquer Normandy w?? many a noble man. And William of Malmesbury in his said second booke beareth witnes that the Cronicles of Normandy doth plainly expresse The name of the Lord Percy w?? was associate to the forenamed Duke Rollo was called Jeffrey Percie A right valiant knight gracious &amp; fortunate whose father named Mainefreed was fallen into fate. The forenamed Duke Rollo gave after his victory to the said Lord Geffray Percy Great possessions in Normandy in the Countrey of Artoys as the story sheweth more plainely In the third booke of William of Malmesbury soone after this Conquest done in Normandy This noble &amp; valiant Duke Rollo of holy Baptisme received the necessary Sacrament And was called Robert for hee desyred soe &amp; L?? Jeffrey Percy w?? devout intent To receive the same grace was glad &amp; centent &amp; of ffrance Arch Bishop of Reine They received Christendome &amp; Baptizacion as Henry of Huntington declareth is his third booke of latin translation. The saide first L?? Geffray Percy was a right noble lord specially accepted for his truth &amp; steadfastnes As the saide Chronicles of Normandy doe record &amp; after many yeares spent in this vale of wretchednes Almighty god called him to his mercifull goodnes In his Celestiall pallas rewarded to bee whom succeeded his eldest sone &amp; heire L?. W?. Percy. The first Lord William Percie sone to the first Lord Jeffray Percy borne in Normandy And Regent of the same made and ordained by the first Richard Duke of Normandy Was L?? of Artoys a knight of noble fame sone &amp; heire to him had his Grandfathers name ffor the second Jeffray Lord Percie hee was call'd, as his Grandfather height &amp; to god &amp; to his prince hee was a faithfull true knight. The second Lord Geffray Percie goodly issue had the second William Lord Pearcie borne in Normandy W?? prospered after his father the Second Lord Jeffray Pearcie &amp; was substantiall and sad And as the ffrench Chroniclers doth expresse &amp; notify, for his valiant acts &amp; faithfulness. Spetially hee was made Earle of Poitiers by noble duke Richard w?? his noble true knights w?? nobles would reward. The second Lord William Pearcie &amp; second William in Normandy borne had issue Lord Jeffray Pearcie the third w?? was Primo genitus In all vertues right excellent as his elders was beforne and as the said Annuall bookes of Normandy shew unto us He had issue the third William Pearcie a knight most famous sone &amp; heire to him &amp; this third William out of Normandy into England with the Conqueror came. This said third Lord William Pearcy as the Chronicles doth tell w? kinge William Conqueror was in favour specially, Hee found none more stedfast amonge all his Councell therefore hee promoted him in favour singularly ffor his merits &amp; his manhood hee loved him cordeally &amp; into the Boreall parts hee willed him to resort a noble Lady caused him to marry named Em de Porte. This Lord William Pearcie the third had his Nativity in Normandy the first here of that name In England after the Conquest as yee shall after see w?? to this day hath floured w??out reproach or shame ffor ffaith &amp; fastnes alway reputed in brute and fame ffrom the Conquest downe lineally my matter shall proceede &amp; if it bee not elegant, yet a true history shall yo? reade. By the vertuous Lady Emme de Port his wife goodly Jssue hee had w?? right prudent were Alane the ffirst, Jeffrey the ffourth in England after the Conquest Richard the ffirst w?? the daies of theire life Spent w?? greate hono? &amp; namely w?? goodly feare in theire due places I shall declare what they were But first by order is my purpose &amp; Intencion Of the noble deedes of the first William Pearcie here in England to make mention. At Whitby hee founded &amp; caused to bee builde a gracious Monastery of Monkes there to serve In the Hono? of god, S?. Peter, &amp; S?. Hilde y? god of his grace the better would him preserve And the perdurable life alsoe y? hee might deserve w?? Abbey hee indewed as hee did other moe w?? large possessions as this booke will declare &amp; showe. The said Monastery first was built of S?. Hilde, Daughter to Kinge Edwyn, y? tyme a place Of Nunnes of the w?? place shee was the first Abbas By inspiration devine but longe after it was Made desolate &amp; destroide by the Danes Cruelty But the said ffirst Lord William Pearcie soone after y? Conquest caused y? said house of Whitby to bee built againe as hee thought best. Couzen to the first Lord William Percie Raynfrede a knight Was first Prior of Whitby inspired by heavenly grace Maintaineinge the foundacion &amp; of his Uuckle the Right Serlo Pearcy the first the second Prior succeeded in short space Brother to y? first Lord William Pearcy &amp; first found? of y? place soe not onely by martiall acts floured the Pearcie name but alsoe y? bloud of them were fathers of Christs Church increasinge vertuous fame. Notw??standinge this first Serlo Pearcy the second Prior of Whitby afterward was the first y? would have wronged his bloud ffrom y? defendinge and foundership of the Abbeie to his duty havinge noe regard God pardon his soule for hee purposed a damnable thinge &amp; when this Serlo could not defeate his brother of his right by wronge surmisinge By craft hee divised &amp; by malice out found to cause his house to pay to the Kinge ten pound At euery vacation w?? now is raised to more large some &amp; bringeth in variance to the house &amp; causeth it in greate damage to din. Noe man may let a religious place to give or lend what they list it affordeth but a small But be it litle or much as shall require the case the founders right title it queteth nothinge at all ffor when the said Serlo Prior of Whitby had laid his traps all, yet god in his power would not suffer it to lye to defraude the right of the foundership fro his brother Lord William Pearcie. In the Monastery of Whitby ould records bee &amp; antient monuments of true remembrance That after the decease of Lord William Pearcy a Controversy was &amp; alsoe a variance Betweene Serlo Pearcy w?? was the second Prior of Whitby &amp; had the gouernance of the said Abbey And the Lord Alane the first founder of the said Monastery his nephew whereupon a wronge title the said Serlo forged out new. To intitle the Kinge as ffounder was the said Priors intent howbeit the Pearcies title is just, plaine, and evident ffor his wrongefull deedes god gave him sore punishment for at longe tyme ere hee departed greate pitty it was to see W?? a contagious Canker rufully vexed was hee after hee had greate repentance for in his conscience hee knew that the Lord William Pearcy his brother was the founder rightfull &amp; true ffor by evidence &amp; deedes under seale w?? I have seene &amp; looked upon the just title of the foundation appeareth, objection may bee none And alsoe scite of the place stands on the Pearcies ground thereupon the said Lord William Pearcie his Abbey first did found. The first William Pearcie in England was an active man of warre &amp; into the holy land hee went at the great voyage w?? Robert Duke of Normandy to the Conqueror of the w?? greate jorney &amp; dangerous passage In his ffourth booke William Moncke of Malmesbury right discreet and sage maketh mention where hee treateth of the Noble Godfrey of Bulloigne &amp; of the said Duke Robert journeyinge into Jerusalem. After many noble deedes done valiantly the said William Pearcie before his returne died as William of Malmesbury in the 2 booke doth expresse In fortifyinge of Christs faith and resistinge the Turks malice &amp; as may bee conjectured in the citty of Antioch in Heathenesse where many noble men departed w?? him to heavenly quietnes after the Citty was gotten as the said William in y? said booke beares witnes. The said Pearcies hart brought into England accordinge to his bequest for in the Abbey of his ffoundacion at Whitby hee willed it to rest This Lord William Pearcie had in Normandy faire patrimony possessions &amp; large dominacions The names Pearcie Surtum abraude &amp; Ftoris w?? liberties many of the w?? is faire evidence, &amp; such probation w?? I have seene &amp; read w?? advised consideration Whereby it appeareth &amp; is right evident, y? y? Pearcies ere they came in w?? the Conquero? were noble &amp; antient. The first Alane Pearcie the first William Pearcies Eldest sone &amp; Heire a knight right valiant was, next after The first William his father by lawfull succession a lady married hee called Em de Gant Hee confirmed his fathers grant of Whitby the foundation the Monks of Whitby were faine to bee under his protection Hee gave to them of reason what they would require &amp; they honoured him as founder w?? harty desyre. By Em de Gant gratious fruite hee had William the second, Walter the first, Alane The second w?? proved wise and sadde &amp; Geffray the second w?? was a right noble man To the w?? second Geffray David kinge of Scotland gave Hedon, &amp; Oxencambe w?? bee in Scotland and afterwards hee Gave them to his fathers foundacion of Whitby as they have evidence to shewe in theire Monastery. By the said Lady Em de Gant Hunmanby came fre w?? the members thereunto therefore of very right True founders of Bridlington the Pearcies be For Gilbert of Gant a full noble knight Was father unto this Lady w?? Em hight W?? Em was married unto first Lord Alane &amp; mother shee was unto the second William. This first Lord Alane to his foundacion of Whitby gave Stokeley Newham, Hackies, Thorneley, &amp; Brokysey The port of the See, &amp; Whitby strand w?? the fforrests, woods, &amp; pastures, lyinge at hand By Em de Port his mother in the chapter house lyeth hee as true founder where there tombes yo? may see And when the Monkes cometh to theire Chapter house of Whitby they are bound to name as theire founder the saide W? Pearcy And to pray for him w?? mind most devoutly, whose hart there in the said Chapter house doth lye. The second William eldest sone &amp; heire to the first Lord Alane succeeded &amp; by Alis his wife daughter to y? L?? Rosse had issue Alane the third, Rob? y? ffirst, and the second Richard: to y? monks of Whitby [hee gave in his life ... Leathum in a perpetuall memory He was the second Lord P?? y? confirmed the ffoundation] These two lines are written in the same hand as the rest of this piece; but afterwards expunged. w?? goodly regard to himselfe &amp; his heires reserved nothinge But the ffoundershippe of the Abbey of Whitby &amp; the defendinge Eldest sone and heire to the second William Alane the third height w?? w??out issue departed The second Richard therefore the second son to William the second brother to the third Allane succeeded of right This Richard the second left after him but small store The third William his Eldest sone &amp; heire I reade of noe more w?? god sent unto him by his wife Lady Jane which was daughter to S? William Bruse of noble fame. These before rehearsed in the Chapter house of Whitby doth ly monge theire ancestors in the said Monastery. After Richards death immediatly the third William succeeded accordinge to right Eldest sone &amp; heire to the second Richard &amp; next him lineally This William Pearcy this noble famous knight was married to a Lady w?? Mary hight. To S? Robert of Turke daughter was shee a valiant man descended of noble antiquity By Lady Mary his wife hee had goodly Issue Walter the Second, Alane the fourth, Richard the third W? y? iiij?? Lord ffoure yee may marke w??in theire youth were brought up w?? manners &amp; virtue But they dyed all children except W? y? fourth a who Clarcke who was after Abbott of Whitby reserved by god to some gracious worke ffor it is not possible for man to compas in his mynd why god taketh one sone, &amp; leaveth here another longe behynd. The yeare of our Lord A Thousand, a hundreth, thirty, &amp; three This third William founded an Abbey Called Handall of holy women of Cysternensis order of Arundell to serve god in theire verginity Hee married Ellenor w?? was daughter to the Earle by whom hee had Issue Henery the ffifth &amp; the eight William as the Pedegree can tell. The Baronage of Anwicke &amp; the signorie was first the Lord Vescy but this fourth Henery Pearcy Of Anthony Becke Bishop of Durham of noble memory did purchase it to him &amp; to his heires lineally In the xx?? yeare of Kinge Edward the first, &amp; of the same Bishop of Durham the said kinge Edward did purchase his manor of Eltham And suffered Alnewicke soe to bee. in his graces recouery of Eltham for the Percies more suretie.
