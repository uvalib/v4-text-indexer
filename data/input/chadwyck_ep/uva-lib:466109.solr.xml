      <field name="fulltext">[This level turnpike road we daily tread] This level turnpike road we daily tread, With its high hedges hiding from our view The features of the land we journey through, Inspires—not dreariness alone—but dread. Let but a cloud eclipse the blue o'erhead, A thicket dull the distance, or a new And unexpected turning change the hue And current of our hopes—and peace is fled! —Then let us leave the road awhile, my friend! How all my being wakes, and, pulsing, thrills To this pure mountain air! As we ascend, How sink to insignificance our ills! Gladness and gloom in perfect beauty blend— Life is a lovely landscape from the hills! [The shepherd Moses on the hillside saw] The shepherd Moses on the hillside saw A green buss bleezin', bleezin' aye awa'; Nae reek rase up, nae ashes fell adoun, There was nae sough o' fire, nae cracklin' soun'; But clear an' constant was the steady flame, An' unconsum'd the buss, an' aye the same. Ye needna doot the shepherd glowred wi' awe At sic a strange suspension o' the law That dooms to swift destruction barn or byre, Biggin' or buss that's grippit ance by fire. In this he saw the presence o' his God, An' felt the grund was holy whaur he trod. That selfsame miracle does yet appear: We see it i' the spring o' every year, When whin an' bonnier broom are fairly bloom'd, An', wavin', burn the same an' unconsum'd —But unregardit o' baith man an' woman, Quite unregardit, for the sicht's sae common! They see't a' gate—alangs' the public way, In gowden beauty bleezin', bleezin' aye, Till every hill-tap, craig, an' spritty knowe Owre Scotland braid like flamin' altars lowe! Yet wha draws near wi' reverential feet? Or is there ane that worships but to see't? Nae thocht is theirs that God's within the buss, Or that the grund is holy brightened thus! PART I.—SONGS. WITHIN THE SKJÆRGAARD. Here, in my little boat embayed, Unseen but safe, I lie, And watch, beyond the headland's shade, The mighty ships go by. Full swells the blue, the brimming tide Sparkles the sunshine clear; And to and fro, and free they glide, And far away, and near. To them the sweep of all the sea, And all the sweep of sky;— This little boat and bay to me And room enough have I Yet still—though hill, and head, and cliff My narrow welkin shear— To witness from my rocking skiff The star of eve appear; And still—though in the sheltering lee And shadow of the shore— To feel the tides of the great sea I will not venture o'er! THE MUSE OF POETRY. They have brought her into the town: Can you wonder she is become pale? I They enticed her away from the mountain, Where lightly she frolickt a fawn, From the truth of her face in the fountain, From peace, and the blessing of dawn. II She had run with the light step of childhood O'er moorland, and meadow, and lea; And hers was the range of the wild wood, Where boldly she sang, and was free. III In the shade of the hazel she rested, She couched among wild flowers and fern; But the stars only knew where she nested— The stars, and the high-sailing ern. IV She was free as the wind, and as froward; And fresh as the rose, and as fair; And her speech, if outspoken, had no word That truth did not wish to be there. V But they saw her, the beaux of the city, And proffered her praise, and a crown; And she yielded—the more was the pity— She yielded, and went to the town. VI And the grace of her virginhood vanished, And all the sweet dreams of her home; And her friends were forbidden, or banished, And freedom to rest or to roam. VII They had crowned her the Siren of Singers —Yet never a song sang she now; For the crown that was gold in their fingers Was lead, and a load on her brow. VIII And her cheek became bloomless and pallid, The sparkle was lost from her eye; —All in vain to her aidance she rallied Her mem'ries: they came but to sigh. IX Can they blame her, those men without pity, For cheeks that are haggard and pale? For they lured her away to the city, And sought of her song to have sale. X Oh, the kiss and the clasp of the moonlight Lay softer by far on her brow Than the gyve—though it looks so like sunlight— Which presses so hard on it now! XI Can they wonder, her prestige recounting, Her voice has been silent so long, Who enticed her away from the fountain And source of all solace and song? ENCHANTED GROUND. I Still by the banks of the stream I stand That borders the land of Truth; The skies are blue, and the winds are bland And blow from the shores of Youth. Rich are the blooms in the amber air, And the forest favours green, And aye the wings of an angel fair Flash through the golden scene! And I hear the bells of Hope that seem To sprinkle the air with sound, Now far away in the depths of a dream, Now clashing all around! II Flow on, flow ever, Fancy dear! Sweet stream I love so well! Blend with the tones I yet do hear From Hope's air-belfried bell! And live, ye winds of youthful years! Still, fostering, let me find, Though on my body age appears, Your freshness on my mind! And still be thy bright wings displayed, Where sometimes I may see And feel their magic, loveliest maid! Angelic Poesie! A MORNING LOVE-SONG. I Woodbine that clingest fair At my love's casement— Sweet be thy savour For sake of her bower! Blossom that swingest there High from the basement— Oh for the favour Thou hast at this hour! II Swallow that wingest the Fleetest of small birds— Thou at her waking Canst see how she seems! Laverock that singest the Sweetest of all birds— Thou at day-breaking Canst break on her dreams! III Morning that flingest bright Gold in the fountain— Oh with thy radiance T'enrapture her eye! Breeze that upspringest light On the green mountain— Oh with thy fragrance T'enfold her and die! WILLIAM'S BRIDAL. “May happiness be in that ha', And bliss be in that bower, And Fortune's golden treasures fa' Upon them every hour!” Oh never since the world began, And love on life had sway, Shone sweeter face or fairer sun Than did that bridal day! “May happiness be in their bower, And bliss be in their ha'—” It was the worship o' the hour, The wish o' ane an' a'. And never cloud aboon them hung That sunny bridal day; And William's bride-elect was young And blithesome as the May! Oh he was brave, and she was braw, And birds aboon them sang; Baith boor and baron blessed the twa— And wha would wished them wrang? —Yet William mounts the weary stairs To sit and sigh his lane, And a' thae bonnie hopes o' theirs Are blastit, ane an' ane! VOX AMORIS. The birds are singing, The woods are ringing, And hark! . . . hark! They're laughing, the waves o' the sea! —Merrily pipe, thou mounting lark! The girl I love loves me! The sun is glancing, The waves are dancing, And look! . . . look! They're smiling, the flowers o' the lea! —Merrily laugh, thou prattling brook! The girl I love loves me! THE DAWN OF LOVE. A young god met me yesternight On the scented sun-dried hill, A young god kissed me on the height And my lips are burning still; And it's oh! it's oh! The morning glow Is pulsing through my frame! And it's oh! it's oh! For the Lapland snow To cool the burning flame! He pressed a soft red lip to mine On the moonlit mountain height, He touched me but with his lips divine And vanished from my sight! But it's oh! it's oh! The morning glow Is pulsing through my frame! And it's oh! it's oh! For the Lapland snow To cool the burning flame! BLUE-BELLS. Thoughts too tender to be spoken Flood my fancy gazing there, Where they, from their kindred broken, Deck that mountain bare! —Blue-bells! crowding in the crevice, What a trustful look ye wear, On the rough breast of Ben Nevis Leaning, free of care! Bonnie when the sunshine glances Like a hope when hopes are rare, On the cliff your shadow dances —Bonnie past compare! Joyous life to you's a duty, Tossing freely, tossing fair, All your blue tumultuous beauty, On the billowy air!— Dream of Beauty! be about me, How or wheresoe'er I fare; What were Earth—were Life without thee But a bleak despair? TO MAISRIE. If you would deign on me to smile, And dare to go with me, I'd bear you to a fairy isle Lies lonely 'mid the sea. And there afar from scenes of pain And hid from human view, We'd practise whether of the twain Was happier—I or you! IN A HOLLOW OF THE HILLS. In a hollow of the hills, Green as Eden round me, By the babble of soft rills Slumber sweet had bound me. As I lay in bliss entranced, Faces, fair and smiling, On me in a vision glanced —All my soul beguiling. Come again, dear angel-dream! Never to be spoken! What though pleasure only seem? Though the charm be broken? He with wisdom were at strife That would “lichtlie” dreaming; Half the joys of waking life, —What are they but seeming? FLOWER-FLAME! One touch of Summer's golden torch And all the land's a-bloom! —The mountain-ridge, the garden-porch With roses burn, and broom! See where it runs along the lane, Flees waving o'er the waste, Expatiates on the mountain plain With purple-spreading haste— It is the fairy floral fire Down-flashed from Summer's sun, Keen-quivering with fulfilled desire And liberty begun! It leaps the grey towers of the wood, And bounds from branch to bough, And radiance, ripe and many-hued, Consumes their gloom! And now It is the fairy forest-bowers With Summer's lamps a-glow! It is the dawn, the day of flowers With every bud a-blow! —One stroke of Winter's leaden mace Amid the Summer's fire, And down the bright flames drop apace, Dull, deaden, and expire! They vanish from the blackened hill, And from the woodland walk, They drop into the droning rill From off the barren stalk! Sobs the lone wind—for ne'er a bloom Of all he kissed remains! It is the ghoulish land of gloom Drenched with December rains! —Eternal Summer! from thy heights Reach down thy torch, we pray! The world is cold without thy lights. —Or come thyself, and stay! THE WALL-FLOWER ON THE WALL. Soft the moonlight's silvery fall On the ruined castle wall, Low the wind's complaining tone Round each worn and wasted stone! Here of yore at gloaming-fall, Shadows on the moonlit wall, Youth and Beauty wandered twining, While the Star of Hope was shining! Then, oh then, sweet love was all!— Castles rose at Fancy's call, Music filled th'enchanted air, Faery blossoms flourished fair! Softly may the moonlight fall On the Wall-flower on the wall! Long and low the wind complain —Love can ne'er be here again! THE LOVER'S WALK. The sunset fires of evening glow Behind a gathering cloud, And winds that from the norlan' blow Go past me piping loud. But down by the meadow, and over the burn, And up by the witch's tree, With many a traverse and many a turn My path this night must be! Between me and the Druid stone A hare scuds o'er the grass; A cushat, with contented moan, Upbraids me as I pass. But through the dark planting, and out on the moss, And over the benty lea, With wall to leap, and water to cross, My path this night shall be! The moon looks up with frightened glower, Dim-glimmering on the night; And what is that by the haunted tower? —My girl in ghostly white! My troubles are over, my travels are done, The fears of the mid-mirk flee; The girl I love, and the only one, —She's true to her tryst with me! THE FISHER. The fisher lights his evening pipe And steers his boat to shore; His wife now from the window looks, Now waits him at the door. Oh low may be the fisher's life, And small and poor his store, But large his love for that dear wife Waits for him at the door. The sunset paves his path with gold —Now what could heart have more? Heaven smiles upon him at the sea, And human love on shore! THE TRYSTING-TREE. Their shadows to the hills return, The sheep are in the pen, And there's a gean by Craigie-burn Is scenting all the glen. Oh braw the birk, and tall the fir, And rich the rowan-tree, And sweet the lilac's lavender —But aye the gean for me! And I to see that bonnie tree Would walk a mile and ten, And after biding there awee Walk blithely back again Yet not for bonnie blossoms white, Nor graceful girlish air So lovely in the dusky light, I call the gean-tree fair. The dear, delightful, darling charm That makes me praise it so, God and good angels keep from harm! —But what, you must not know! THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY. The knight rides merrily forth to fight— Oh but the birds sing cheerily! The lady weeps from morn till night While the rain falls wearily. The knight wins love and high renown— Oh but the birds sing cheerily! The lady's tears still wimple down As the rain falls wearily. The knight comes back all gay of heart— Oh but the birds sing cheerily! The lady in mirth must bear her part Though the rain falls wearily. The knight he knows his fame is spread— Oh but the birds sing cheerily! The lady knows that his love is dead, And the rain falls wearily. PART II.—SCENES. OUTWARD BOUND. Reddas incolumem, precor, Et serves animæ dimidium meæ. Hor., Car. 3, Lib. I. I She speeds through southern seas; And William in the bow —His white hair by the steady breeze Blown forward on his brow— Sees other scenes than Scottish trees And Scottish burnies now. II Forward he seems to lean— As if with eager eyes To anticipate the future scene That far before him lies Beyond the line that sweeps between The ocean and the skies. III What marvels lay aside Their mystery to him! What famous islets are descried On the horizon dim! What constellations o'er him slide! What monsters past him swim! IV Leviathan at play Tempests the weltering brine; The Southern Cross redeems the day With radiancy divine; And on yon rock Napoleon lay After his great decline! V We traced, and traced again, Schoolboys, with knitted brow, Upon one atlas with a pen The track of that ship's prow: —I had the fuller knowledge then, He has the ampler now. VI Down the blue hemisphere, White sail! to Table Bay, For sake of one whom we hold dear, Glide steadily, we pray— We twenty, in the hamlet here, Whose hearts thou bear'st away! SUNSET ON THE LOMONDS. See where into the sunset far The terraced mountains rise, The cresset of a single star Just o'er them in the skies! Oh that to me a dove's meek eyes And snow-white wings were given, To reach yon hills and realise The calm they have from Heaven! My soul is o'er the Vale of Leven, (Though here in streets I stray) Till fades the holy golden even; —The wish, too, dies away! Alas for earth, that all it may Is but a mood in me! And that when Heaven withdraws its ray The mood should cease to be! OUR DRIVE. The toll-road we left where a by-way Leaves room for a burnie between, And now we look out on the highway From under an awning of green. The bees in the cherry-tree o'er us Hum low, and are happy by stealth, While hither and thither before us Flaunt coach-loads of fashion and wealth. They're glancing and prancing, and feather And ribbon are sweeping the sky —We sit in our arbour together And smilingly let them go by! For we too are rich, and we know it, In health and in hope and in brains; And hold with the old Hebrew poet —Earth ours, and the joys it contains. We, too, by the laws that o'er-rule us, Career it as grand as the great, Our horses the forces that pull us, And earth our Quadriga of State! Away in a curve that encloses The golden abode of the sun, Through snowflakes, and raindrops, and roses, The steeds of our universe run! How swiftly the wheels are revolving! How smoothly we're bowling along! —Come, Janet! I hope you're resolving To honour our drive with a song! While I, with my heel on a pansy, And thyme in a bank at my back, Will finger the reins with the fancy Of keeping our steeds in the track! HOLIDAYS. Once more, once more again On me, from city cares who fly, Lochleven, like a loving eye, Looks round the shoulder of the hills; And all life's artificial ills Pass from me with their pain! The smoke will leave a stain; In absence of the cleansing shower The dust will dim the freshest flower: Happy the heart on whom the dust Of active life (for blow it must) Grows not a thing in grain! Nor are those ills in vain: They come upon our passions here Like winter rigours on the year— The purer are the daisies' dyes When Spring comes round, bluer the skies, And welcomer the rain! To some the breezy main; To some the moors and burns; to some Who cannot go, sweet thoughts will come; To me—enfranchisement from ills When gleams, as now, between the hills Lochleven o'er the plain. CASTLE GLOOM. The hand of Time, O Castle Gloom! Will soon be thy undoing; The Mene Mene of thy doom Is written on thy ruin! What though the Ochils round thee stand, A bulwark firm and fast? Thy strength is as the broken sand, Thy pride of power is past. And of thy walls, to dust decayed, The rain has made a mould Which feeds the saddening nettle-blade, Or wall-flower flecked with gold. The mountain-ash with berries red Looks through thy windows high, And rain upon thy floors is shed From rain-clouds passing by. Still brawls the Sorrow round thy base To join his brother Care; —Oh, ill-advised they chose the place Who reared thy fabric there! Ill-chosen was the place, the hour, Ill-omened was the name; The sun even in meridian power Glooms on thy rugged frame! —Yet once, ere time completes thy doom, Thy halls with joy shall ring Frightening the dreary birds of gloom That to thy corners cling. For in thy topmost tower to-night Two hearts, made one in tune, With Hymen's torches burning bright Light up the honeymoon. And from thy topmost window-seat, When next the sun has shone, His smile responsive smiles shall meet, More cheerful than his own! MY WINDOW. Where gold laburnum hangs in fringe And fragrant lilacs blow, Where resting rays with rosy tinge Suffuse the hawthorn's snow, Through elm-trees high in pride that stand With heads that pierce the skies, My window gazes on the land That low before it lies. Fair cultured fields in youthful bloom, Whose freshness glads the eye, With here and there a grateful gloom Of forest dense and high, With here and there a white highroad By March winds bleached and clean, And thousand gleams of water strewed At random in between;— In terraces they slope away To meet reflected sky— The deep blue waters of the bay That clear and tranquil lie. The far horizon's line of light, The sunny, open sea, The distant sails that glimmer white— How glad, and young, and free! THE CATARACT. See where he bursts in beauty bar and lock In a fierce haste to wed with her below, The gentle Elv, that steals with rippling flow Along the deep-sunk dale! With what a shock His feet alight on this pink granite block! And how, half-stunned, he staggers to and fro, Compelled to pause, yet passionate to go, Till, steadying all his strength, he shoots the rock! The hazel coppice and a belt of pine Receive him next after his madman's bound; Yet still I see his great eyes, questing, shine Between the branches; and I hear the sound Of one whose lip is near some joy divine, Broken, and low, and last in rapture drowned. CASTLE DESOLATE. On broken wall and fallen stone Are grass and lichen growing, And winds around the courtyard moan Where bugles once were blowing! And grey Oblivion's eyeless face Looks blankly through the grating Where ladies once with witching grace Smiled to their knights in waiting! And kaes and starlings build and breed Where social fires were roaring, And from the donjon, choked with weed, A lark aloft is soaring. WINTER: AN ELEGY. I I look from my lonely window Over the snowy plain— A hearse and a handful of mourners Are creeping through the rain. The flowers are dead and departed, The memory of Summer is gone, Song from the lark, and the lark from heaven, —And the day drags on! II My soul looks out from its grating, And sees without a sigh The funeral train of youthful hopes Mournfully pass by. Health, and the joy of existence, And the faiths that wont to be, And love are dead and departing —It's winter with me! THE VOICES OF NORWAY. The cataract thundering from the airy rock, Or shouting through the forest wild and free; The river roaring onward to the sea, Defiant of all craft to bind or block Its loose unshackled strength; the thunder-shock, Echoed in silence round the blasted tree; And the black eagle screaming in his glee Above the storm, which his strong wings bemock: —These are old Norway's voices: not the shrill Whistle of steam-car jarring down the street, Nor clang of factory-bell, nor clank of mill Banging and beating to a fever-heat Of madness blood and brain; but Nature still Inhabits here, and men sit at her feet! SUMMER ON THE LOMOND. The silver mists of morning rise Obedient to the sun, And lo! the Lomond—to my eyes Of all the hills that kiss the skies The dearest fairest one. To Alps or Andes let them hie Who slight the hills at home— To Alps and Andes let them fly: With freer step will you and I Upon the Lomond roam. Its ample upland lawns be ours, Forsaken yet so fair; Its braes, its burnies, and its flowers, Its long calm summer pastoral hours, And its ethereal air! Oh sweet is love at eventide In green suburban lane! But on the Lomond—time is wide, And life is love, and glorified, And Eden back again! IN ORWELL ACRE. “Sui Vitam Innocuam per Plurima Lustra Peregit Pace Diu Gaudens Hic Tumulatus Obit Robertus Paterson—Mortem Subiit Ann. Dom. 1669, Ætatis Vero 97.” Forget-me-nots around the table grow —Nature's unconscious satire, for indeed, What with the weather, wear of time, and weed, We scarce make out the little that we know Of Robert Paterson who sleeps below. Patience and spell! And now at last we read In Latin old the meagre facts we need To set us thinking of the long ago. Here was a patriarchal length of life That ran its peaceful course to ninety-seven, Begun when Shakespeare played, nor thought of wife, (A little tiny boy “When that I was, and a little tiny boy, &amp;c. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey-ho! the wind and the rain.”) beside the Avon; And closed while Herrick, heedless of the strife Of civil war, was singing down in Devon! THE LARK. The curtains of the East are drawn, The sun is looking through, And hark! the minstrel of the dawn Is up, and at it too! What gushes of true song are these From fountains of the sky Flung heedless on the morning breeze That heedless passes by! Was ever mortal beauty blest, In modern days or old, With half so sweet salute addrest From lover's lips of gold? Nay; but did ever splendour grace, Or smiling mirth adorn, A fairer or a happier face Than that of Lady Morn? Oh still, where loveliness is had, With equal length so long Will beauty make the minstrel glad And gladness run to song! Thou glorious poet of the dawn! What melodies are these Thou flingest heedlessly upon The unremembering breeze? Could I, in human paraphrase, But fix them in a book, On which in dark and rainy days, When thou art dumb, to look— What harmonies should then be heard Of word and note complete! —With thee, thou little Bird and Bard, Not one would dare compete! A FIRST OF MAY. It was the first of May, and from the town Our young folks hastened in their best array, Our young folks hastened to bring in the May From where she loitered on the distant down. Said one—I hope she wears her snow-white crown; And one—They heard the cuckoo yesterday; I see her—cried another—far away Like a thin streak of silver on the brown! So to the down we came, and here and there Our little troop went peering far and wide; Then gathered silent: every bush was bare, And snow in the bleak hollows was descried, And new-born lambs wailed to the wintry air Their feeble plaints along the lorn hillside! THE BURN. Where hazel-branches meet o'erhead In shade translucent green, The burn springs from its rocky bed And plashes cool between. It dashes brightly down the den, Touched by the morning sun, And seeks the flat green fields of men To have its work begun. It stays not for the pink wild-rose That bends and blushes shy, Nor for the bank where glittering grows The graceful birk-tree nigh, Nor for the blue-bell, throned a queen Amid the strawberry leaves— For all the beauties of the scene It neither stays nor grieves. It steals one look, in leaping down, Towards the distant sky Where grand and solemn, still and lown, The cloudy mountains lie, Then flings its bright young life along The plains that thirsty be, And rushes in the river strong Towards the endless sea! ANDRO'S GRIEF. The winds, as day was dawning, slept After a stormy parley; And up the sky the laverock leapt From out the “mixing” barley, When Andro from his cottage stept And looked to heaven, and wept! I saw his face—his face was pale, Tears from his eyes were breaking, Yet neither sob nor sound of wail Told that his heart was aching: The aching heart—it knows its ail; But what would words avail? His little white-haired boy had died As dawned the tranquil morning, And Andro's grief was ill to hide, And yet, disclosure scorning, He hailed me as I passed, and cried— “A pleasant morning ride!” THE SUN'S GOOD NIGHT. Over the mountain's shoulder looks The Sun to say Good night To all the merry singing brooks That sparkled in his light; To all the dancing waterfalls That dashed their diamond spray Against their green and ferny walls In greeting to the day; To every hill whose gentle breast Swells up into the sky; To every flower that seeks a nest Amid the bent so dry; To all the brave blue-bells that swing In every passing wind; To every bird whose wearied wing A resting-place can find; To quiet sheep that contemplate His beams in grassy places; To children with his smiles that wait Upon their chubby faces; To every tree that glads the glen, Sweet birch and rowan ruddy; To happy wives, and resting men, And every other body! A TRANSFORMATION. All round a sky of dead continuous grey Smothered the valley like a smoky tent, Save that a small well-marked irregular rent In the low roof let in a gleam of day. All morning to that gap mine eyes would stray For the blue freedom of the firmament, And with that window I had been content To gaze afar into the heavens alway. But suddenly the travelling sun above Came to the lattice, and lo! the earth was fair; The clouds took on the lustre of a dove, Twinkled, and flew, and melted into air! —Such wonders works the smile of one we love When we are half abandoned to despair! A DREAM. O'erburdened with a weight of woes, amassed Slowly, I prayed—Kind spirit, grant a boon: Show me that mine's a common care!—And soon (The present like a mantle from me cast) I wandered blindfold forward; till, at last, The land of shadows and of shapes unhewn! And lo! the pale face of a frightened moon Looked on a sea of faces surging past! And one sad face out of the tidal throng, One out of millions, for a moment seen, Turned round upon me as it swept along, And a strange sudden joy altered the mien —A smile sat on the lips that framed a song, And the bright eyes spoke of a faith serene! TREASURE-TROVE. Clive, walking down that gallery of gold; A shepherd in the bush, whose staring eyes Half doubt the nugget at his feet that lies From nature's secret treasure-house outrolled; A ragged schoolboy, clutching in his hold A sudden sixpence;—vainly memory tries Similitudes to make you realise Her ecstasy: but no! it can't be told! —What was my find, you ask? It was the hour Friendly to love, when, seeing yet concealed, Its votaries worship in a twilight bower, That, at a crossing, at one step revealed, Just standing clear of the cathedral tower, The new moon argent in an azure field! RUS IN URBE. Among the city sounds to-day I heard the clacking of a loom, Or thought I heard; and far away My heart went bounding to the broom, The golden broom! that to a town Whose name to me is ever sweet, Comes from the hillside tumbling down And laughs along the lonely street. I saw among the fragrant broom The herd, a hardy sun-browned elf, Inhabiting a world of bloom, —As once it might have been myself. I heard the carol of the lark, The lyric of the laden bee; I saw the silver-glistening bark, And tresses of the birken tree; The poplars growing by the manse, The water bubbling from the well —How clear as crystal was its glance! How musically soft it fell! I saw the school, the children too, The maps upon the schoolroom wall, The playground—and the white-veined blue Of God's protection over all! The linen bleaching on the green; The basins, shimmering in the light; Shrill laughter from a child unseen Bringing a searching maid in sight. I heard the anvil's tinkling sound, The smith himself was hid from view; I saw the wheel-wright's wheels so round Set up in staring red and blue. The church, the mill, the village store, The carrier half-way down the street, The casks around the grocer's door, And Pincher winking in the heat; The cottage-windows, bright to view With flowers (in pot and box) in bloom —And all this vision woven to The fancied clacking of a loom!— The sanded doorstep, and the row Of haddocks hardening on the wall, And “bobbin” wives that come and go, And spinning-wheels—I saw them all! And this was in the city street With traffic's current pouring strong, Its black waves weltering at my feet And roaring as they rushed along! Crack! went a passing cabman's whip, —Burst on my ears the world of din; The vision gave my mind the slip, And all the city hemmed me in! THE SPRING WOODS. In life's young ardent prime, When winds were soft and skies were blue, And spring was making Earth anew, These woodlands I have wandered through From daybreak till the fall of dew, Oh many, and many a time! And now, from foreign clime Backward returning with the heat Of youth-time gone, I set my feet In the old welcoming wood-retreat With joy, and hear the birds repeat With joy the same old rhyme! Morning and evening chime— The same old joys of eye and ear Invite me still, and still are dear; And merry schoolboys rambling here, As I did whilom fifty year, Repeat the pantomime! A SERVICE OF LAMPS. I woke, and chair and floor were strewn With leaves of silver thin, And at the lattice, lo! the moon Quite close and staring in! I slept, and woke again, and lo! A glory unforetold— As of a sudden morning glow— Filled all the room with gold! What glorious travelling lamps are these That o'er my pillow sweep! —Between their splendid services Lay just three hours of sleep. THE EPILOGUE. The season's o'er; sport (save the mark!) is poor, And on the heather scarcely now remains A single gun: already winter rains Darken and drown the melancholy moor. And now, where social coveys played secure Ere the red Twelfth began, a voice complains, To winds that sob in answer, of the pains The gentle tenants of the waste endure. It is a plover, wailing through the shade Of night and rain-cloud on the upland lea, Around the marsh, where in the spring it played, And piped in summer, with its kindred free In the bright sunshine. —Plaints like its have made The moor a melancholy place to me. LOCHLEVEN FROM TILLERY HILL. Look back!—Lochleven, and a rare surprise! Long silver lines across its bosom run Bright in the light of the September sun: The rest in purple shadow slumbering lies. Yonder Benarty, here the Lomonds rise, And you may count the islands every one —There, in yon castle on the island dun, Languished Queen Mary, loved of many eyes!— The scene, though quiet, yet is fair—and full Of interest to a guide that knows his trade; Chiefly, I must confess, to me (and you'll Perhaps endorse the opinion when it's made), For that Servanus kept his Culdee school On yon St Serf's Island. lone island in Benarty's shade. ON READING DR JAMIESON'S HISTORY OF THE CULDEES. Honour to them who put to rout the dark Of Druid rule over our land forlorn, What time to lone Iona, ocean-born, Came through the mists Columba's wandering bark! Honour to them who in a fragile ark Nursed the true light amid prelatic scorn And papist, till the Reformation morn At midnight rose from its expiring spark! Now in these latter times the light again, Menaced by controversial mists and blasts, Grows dim behind the clouds, and purblind men Follow rush-candles while the tumult lasts: —But blow, thou clear strong wind of Truth! and then Shine forth, pure Faith! on strayed enthusiasts. PAST AND FUTURE. In Spring, when hopes like primroses were blooming, And youth was in its prime, 'Twas here we talked, our cares to come assuming, Like fools, before their time. We turned our faces from the past so tearless, So fresh, and free of stain, And for the future longed so blindly fearless We never dreamt of pain. And now again after a seven years' roaming, Under the same green lime, We almost sigh in the dim summer gloaming For that neglected prime. A LOVE IDYL. Scene—An Orchard. Idly roving without aim Up the orchard path he came, When, from out a corner cosy, Stept and stopt him, blushing rosy, Rosy with her face aflame! (He speaks—) Rosy! You deserve your name! Cheek and chin, and brow and bosy, —All are of one colour, rosy! (A Pause. Then—) Is it shyness? . . . Is it shame? . . . Shall I bless you? . . . Shall I blame? . . . Ear and eyelid, neck and nosy! —Was it cherry-brandy, Rosy? . . . Is't a lover? (A longer pause. No answer. Then—) Here's a game! Well, I'll stalk him, wild or tame. No! you shall not stop me, Rosy! —Ah! he's bolted; yonder goes he! (Looking after a retreating figure, her brother continues—) I should know that agile frame . . . Rosy! won't you tell his name? Come, you'd better! (She whispers a name. Then he—) Good for Rosy! Why, he's King of Trumps, is Josey! THE COUNTRY LAIRD. (Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis, &amp;c.) Happy the man who leads the life Of patriarch of old, Far from the city's fevering strife And from the race for gold. He owns with pride his fathers' lands —Who would that pride condemn? And cultivates with his own hands The fields he had from them. A soldier, when the bugle calls, Must leap to meet the foe; A sailor, when the storm appals, Must hurry from below! A lawyer must attend his case, His client at his heel; A hanger-on, to earn a place, Must knuckle down, and kneel. From fear, and care, and envious hopes, The country laird is free, As to the breezy mountain-slopes At morning forth goes he! How pleasant from their pastoral tops To watch his herds below; Or see, at mid-day, in the copse The oaks he planted grow! Now in his garden in the cool Of shady flowering trees, He plies an easy gardening tool, Or overlooks his bees. Or on the first warm day in May After a genial spring, He rises at the peep of day To view the sheep-shearing. Or, when the year to harvest comes, He stooks the golden sheaves, Or counts his juicy pears and plums And looks in vain for leaves! While these delightful seasons pass, He sometimes may be seen Extended on the scented grass Beneath a leafy screen. Soft sunshine through the branches peeps, And fountains fall around, And wrens and robins sing—he sleeps, Yet hears in sleep their sound. But Winter comes: the trees are bare, The fields are hard with frost; And now, you ask, how does he fare? —Are all his pleasures lost? See him at early morning, capped With fox-fur for the cold, Step forth, well-breakfasted and wrapped, A hardy hunter bold! On his left arm the shining steel, Upon his back the bag, And sure, but shivering, at his heel, Spotty, and Spring, and Shag. Two red hares in the valley bleed, One blue hare on the hill; But round the marsh, where wild-fowl feed, There is a deadly kill! Four brace of snipe, a ptarmigan, Six brace of duck and teal, And, maybe, a fat Iceland swan Fall to the pointed steel. As homeward in the early gloom A tired man he returns, He sees far off his dining-room, The fire within that burns; And, waiting with a welcoming smile, His healthy comely wife —For an unwedded love's a wile To mar the happiest life. And now—while bon vivants in town Sit o'er their oyster-sauce, Or gulp the fat green turtle down Their vitiated hausse; Or French ragout, or fricassee, With unclean jaws devour, Drenching th'unhallowed mixture wi' A claret cold and sour; Or, maybe, in a lodging-house, Or modish restaurant, They pick their morsel of a mouse While still the doors go bang! As black-tailed mutes, bedropt with grease, Whisk out, and whirry in, And bring the biscuit and the cheese Before you well begin— He sits at his own table-head In peace, and plenty too, And eats his game to home-baked bread And native mountain-dew! One tidy Phyllis, and no more, To whom he needs but look, Receives the dishes at the door From a sweet-tempered cook! He drinks the Queen, the Church and State, The landed Interest too; Then, turning to his smiling mate —“And this, my dear, to you!” —Oh, that's the life, as all will own, Securest yet from sorrow; I'll sell my shares, call up my loans, And buy a farm to-morrow! He raised his loans—he realised Ten thousand for that end; A fortnight—and he advertised Ten thousand pounds to lend! MORNING RAINBOW. In glint and gloom the barley swayed, The darting swallow sang, And sweetly in the gleaming glade The bursting blossoms sprang. As blithesomely I looked along Its line of checkered shade, A rainbow o'er the roadway flung A bridge of glorious braid! The vision stood before I knew, And what was earth but lately (For though it was a charming view It did not thrill me greatly) Became transfigured, grew to me Heaven's glorious portal straightway; —Expectant I looked up to see An angel in the gateway. THE HAWK AND THE TWO LINNETS. A hawk was wheeling in the high hill-air, With systematic curve gleaning the heather, On the fierce outlook for a partridge feather Or moor-cock's claw—your hawk loves dainty fare— When, just beneath him, rose a loving pair Of linnets, and on social wing together Flew jauntily along—they best knew whither— Singing, and of their danger unaware. He saw, and, ceasing his aerial tour, Hung motionless by the sheer strength of will; Then, like a stone slung with precision sure And deadly force, meant not to maim but kill, Down came his hawkship, missed, and struck the moor; And those two linnets—they await him still! THE LAST NIGHT ON THE TOWER. While to the West the sky is clear, Of palest amber hue, Where warmer tints just disappear —The East is purely blue; The blue of which blue-bells are made, As soft as air in Spring, With here and there a cloudlet laid White as an angel's wing. Down in the vale the village sleeps Wrapt in a smoky shroud, Save where some cottage firelight peeps Half frightened through the cloud. And in the gloom the woody glen Seems to contract and close Its sundered sides to meet again, Forgetting they were foes. The rounded outlines of the hills Are carven on the sky; A star into existence thrills And trembles there on high. Oh fairer than a diamond bright Upon a queenly brow, The first fair jewel of the Night Hangs o'er Craiginnan Knowe. Behind Castle Campbell. The rushing of the restless streams The Care, and the Sorrow—which unite just below the old castle. Is surging in the air; Far up, among the mountains, gleams Each fountain, calm and fair. But ever run the rapid rills To seek the Sea's unrest —And we, too, must forsake the hills Upon the self-same quest! PART III.—SATIRES. BONES. The type is common: there's at least a score That look on life as a rare piece of fun And all its business a burlesque, for one That sits and thinks the matter gravely o'er. You bear with this—you bear it, and deplore; But when in private life you cannot shun Nor stop the laughing misery, once begun —'Tis past all bearing, and the man's a bore! He comes, and straight, up-curls the labial sheath, Revealing all his dentistry within, As if the man were God-made for his teeth And not to show them were the fatal sin! Is there no power above (there's none beneath) To legislate a close time for the grin? NIL NISI MENDACIA! They laud him in the city: seated here In sober contemplation, God forbid That I should seek to hale what He has hid From the dead bosom on that lowly bier. —Yet I will dare to speak and be sincere: His life like a smooth-flowing current slid And wound through loamy flats; dozing, he did The easy duty of his narrow sphere. —But now they deify him?—That's the wine The soups and savoury suppers that he gave: You may be Divus too, if you incline; —Give banquets while you live, and, when you “cave,” Broadnose will snuffle platitudes divine, And Goatlegs dance devoutly on your grave. IN SEVEN YEARS. Seven years ago—only seven years ago He sat beside me in the Lecture-room In all the grace of literary bloom, And spake of what the next seven years would show. Songs, and an Epic, and a Play—but no! The Drama was played out: he would assume Some strange new form, all radiance and perfume, And sling his fancies o'er creation so! —I stumbled on him near a farm to-day, Straws in his hair and hog-wash on his sleeves; Loud was his voice, dew-lapped his throat, and—Hay! Damn you, the stirks are in among the sheaves! Amused, but startled more, I turned away And left him to his bullocks and his beeves. KINGS BY DIVINE RIGHT. Not these are kings—not these! Though girt with gold each brow, And courtiers on their supple knees Before them bow! Though couriers at the gate Await their sealed commands, To bear the fiat of their fate To distant lands! Though idle throats bray out Their vivats where they pass, And helmets compass them about With blaze of brass! Load them with gem and jew'l And pearl and purple fine —Not these, not these the kings that rule By right divine! What! chosen by the dice Of fate—the fault of birth, Is he, this vicious rake, the vice Of God on earth? Or tyrants and their tools —Does Heaven their crimes ordain? By sufferance of their fellow-fools The puppets reign! Who, then, are those that reign O'er this terraqueous ball From East to West and back again, Owning it all? The Potentates of Thought, Of Language and of Lay— Milton and Shakespeare, Schiller, Scott, And such as they! And of the kingly guild Are all who feel the flame Of genius—famed or unfulfilled Their dawning fame! Unmarked they come and go, Of outward splendour shorn; Yet kings are they without their show, And princes born! Through woods they wander, and On lonely hillsides sit, Too surely conscious of command To blazon it! Yet far as sky is curled Or lightnings flash their fire, They are the kings that rule the world By God's desire! And over all the earth Their deathless couriers ride— Passion and pathos, scorn and mirth, And love and pride! By these they gently sway, Enlighten, charm, and bless; By these they devastate, and slay, Free and redress! Sceptre nor sword they need, Nor sense-convincing sign: They are the kings that rule indeed By right divine! CHRISTOPHER SLY: HIS POLITICAL SENTIMENTS. The Peers! With what complacency they stand On heights englorified with golden fire! Look up, you tinker!—look up, and admire, And let your grovelling soul with pride expand! These are the guardians of your native land— “And they possess it too!” But that's their hire For guarding it: all bravery would expire Unless rewarded with a liberal hand: Their fathers bled for it—“Get out! you lie! Mine fled for it, he did, at Waterloo!” And they are long descended—“So am I; My dad came over with the Conqueror too; And what d'ye do for me? for Christopher Sly? —Gimme a pot of ale, for Godsake do!” PART IV.—PSALMS. [O Lord, all things are praising Thee always!] O Lord, all things are praising Thee always! The mountain's peaceful power; the restless sea With all its surging music, fiercely free; The busy rill that stone nor stumbling stays; The fairy blue-bells swinging on the braes In their ethereal beauty born of Thee: And with distinctest voice of all does he, My own belovèd, utter forth Thy praise! But I, who worship Thee from day to day In silence inarticulate, and seek Passionately to praise Thee, and who pray With feeling strong but thought and utter ance weak, Am dumb as are the pebbles of the way— Or as an infant, trying first to speak. SONG OF THE BLADES OF GRASS. Humble we are and lowly, Made to be trodden on; Once we had hope, but slowly, Softly that hope has gone; Yet we despair not wholly— On us a star has shone! When we first woke from sleeping, Rose from our earth-bed warm, Kindly the light came peeping Under the tall bent's arm, And the blue sky seemed keeping All on the earth from harm. But “Here is nought abiding” Mournful long grasses say, Shaking their heads, and hiding From us the light of day, E'en in the sunshine chiding If we are glad and gay. Strange are the things they tell us— How can the mighty powers Ruling the sky be jealous Of such a joy as ours? Sending forth storms to quell us, Darkness, and driving showers. And when the sky is dreary, When from the mists the sun Staggers out wan and weary As if his strength were done, Cry they “'Tis this we fear aye! This is our doom begun!” We are so young beside them Withered and old and grey, We never dare to chide them, No matter what they say; They would have ill betide them, We would have good alway. Surely the skies have heard them Murmur in midst of bliss, And to their wish preferred them— To a grey gloom like this— As in a grave interred them Safe from the sunlight's kiss. Boisterous winds are brawling Over the patient hill; Something upon us falling Heavy and damp and chill Seems to be ever calling “Down, little blades, lie still!” Summer, so long expected, Welcome however late! Come to our hearts dejected, Smile on our dismal fate, Leave us no more neglected —It is so hard to wait! “Patience!” they answer kindly, Shadow and shower and breeze— “Rest in the gloom resign'dly, Taking what Heaven may please: Trust, little children, blindly: None of us farther sees.” Yet there was, one morn, lightly Hung in our midst, a star! Glittering and beckoning brightly In the high blue afar —Once we saw many nightly, Now know not where they are! Some of our hopes are blighted— Hopes of a summer gone; Hopes to be no more slighted Trampled, and trodden on: Yet are we not benighted —On us a star has shone! DISTRUST. To-day my future seemed too golden clear. It cannot be, I said, it cannot be; God never meant such happiness for me— It is not good to have such pleasure here. Thus medicining my cup of joy with fear I sought my window, hoping half to see The smiling heaven o'erclouded ominously— And scared a bird, who thought I came too near. Ungrateful bird! It was my hand that spread That feast of crumbs for thee, and fleest thou thus? Canst thou not trust the hand that gives thee bread? Why then so doubtful and so timorous? —Lord, do we grieve Thee likewise with our dread, Distrusting all Thy gracious gifts to us? THE COMMON CREED. Lord, with blind eyes we look, and fear; We listen with deaf ears, and start; We think Thou mayst be very near —But oh! Thou ever silent art! And we that would obey Thy will, For Thou, we feel, art wise and good, Search for it in our hearts; but still, O Lord, it is misunderstood! We follow where our passions lead, Deeming them lights that lead to Thee; And when it is Thy light, indeed, We think it false, and from it flee! The soul ignores the human part, The human part denies the soul; To this we lean, from that we start, And back again to that we roll! We weep in hope, we weep in fear, Through life's long idly striving day; And what our hands collect and rear, Our hearts destroy, and cast away! There is no rock on which to rest And raise the fabric of a life! Time with its changes tries the best, Long ere oblivion ends the strife! Yet Thou that mad'st the human heart A home of vexing hopes and fears, —Our Father, not on earth that art, Wilt surely one day dry our tears! IN THE CHURCHYARD AT CHRISTIANIA. Death has no province in the Northern Land, To fetter, terrorise with threats, and slay; But when he comes (and that late in the day) He comes, as an official with his wand, Wearing a bosom-flower and smiling bland, To lead the spirit to its rest away. Few tears, or none, are shed—not more than may Grace a departure to some distant strand. They lay the body where they can re-view Daily its resting-place: no yew-trees wave Funereal plumes around of faithless hue, A sieve for all the sorrowing winds that rave, But lightsome blossoms blend their white and blue To make a pleasure-garden of the grave. AN EVENING HOUR IN ORWELL ACRE. Here, in the churchyard by the lake, One vigil hour I'll gladly wake, Where Orwell's buried thousands sleep In social slumber, calm and deep. Here, while the glooms of evening spread, I'll sit among the slumbering dead —No melancholy misanthrope, Bankrupt of health and heart and hope; But full of life, and like to live, Thankful for joys this earth can give, A young man drawing cheerful breath, And yet—no enemy to Death! I would not have a shortened day; And neither would I live alway. But, since the end I may not know Of why I live or where I go, With calm obedience I would wait The pleasure of omniscient Fate. 'Tis pleasant in the sun to live; And Night has her own joys to give. Our very sorrows and our cares —The pain they bring us is not theirs; Time passes and the pain has oozed, And now they seem like joys misused. In calm Eternity's wide view Little should vex or me or you. Even Death, which each must undergo, Whether he bows to it or no, —'Tis far too common to be sent Upon us for a punishment. And I would rather make a friend And talk of him before the end Familiarly—keeping the faith Of all our family with Death. As thus: I have a canker-care; It haunts me here, it hounds me there; But Thou wilt heal (if none before), And it will trouble me no more. A rival; and he hates me hard, The harder for my friends' regard; Drowning—he would not help me, no! Yet drowned—and he would weep, I know. We are but boys—fall out and fight, And cry, and make it up at night, When Thou wilt stroke us on the head And put us sobbing both to bed. How calmly by the mimic deep The buried crowds of Orwell sleep, Careless of all that once was dear, And past the sway of hope and fear! How enviably long and deep The buried cares of Orwell sleep! Night occupies Benarty hill, The last belated bird is still, A far-off cottage light goes out, And darkness gropes the world about! Save now and then amid the sigh Of sedges, or the pinewood nigh, A cushat's low domestic moan, The worlds of Life and Death are lone; Farmhouse and churchyard, lake and hill, Alike mysteriously still! Not stiller in the chancel light Lies the effigies of a knight Upon the lid of marble stone He lifts his mailèd hands upon —His child-meek hands, no more to feel The pulse of war, the strength of steel— Than I, upon this green grave-bed, Rapt into concord with the dead! I feel, as at the door of death, My spirit drawing curious breath! Methinks, though life to me is dear, 'Twere little to die now and here— To lay upon this turf my head As on the pillow of a bed, With this to deepen the delight That I should have no fears to-night, And only this to give me pain That one might call on me in vain. SONG OF THE CLOVER BLOSSOM. Within a soft and verdant bed Of clover leaves I lie, While drives the tall grass overhead Athwart a cloudy sky. The wind, that rocks it to and fro In agony of pain, Is whispering soft to me below Of pleasant things, and plain. The long stems, in their anguish, twist And bend as low as I; Yet see they but the clammy mist That makes the fair light die. Oh, I am poor and small, I know, And cannot see so far; I only give my scent to blow Where no sweet odours are. I only gaze up timidly And wish the light were there, With no strong cry of agony —No heaven-constraining prayer. I take the sorrow to my heart Unshrinkingly and dumb, And wait till darkness shall depart And sunlight's glory come. SABBATH ON THE HILLS. O Lord our God, we praise Thee on the height! Here in Thy smiling sunshine would we fling Earth's mantle from our souls, and let them spring Soaring to Thee, the Father of all light! From these Thy holy hills their sunward flight Nor toilsome were, nor tedious; on the wing Of this pure air upborne, still should they sing, Drawn, praising Thee, from earth to the Infinite. —There are no larks to bless this solitude. Silent it lies and looks on the blue sky Like some great giant, softened and subdued By the mild lustre of a loving eye; Yet, though by angels' song Thine ear is wooed, Thou hearest, Lord, the linnet's feeble cry! A RAILWAY ACCIDENT. For ever in my memory fast I see thee as I saw thee last. —What demon tempts me thus to look Upon the page of Memory's book, Where, blurred with blood, with anguish wet, The annals of that hour are set? —Heaven from mine eyes in mercy keep That spectacle that murders sleep! Surely the pitying angels wept That should have compassed round and kept This gentle life that did no harm, And was of mine the darling charm! The cruel tragedy is past, And thou—for ever safe at last! They shut the door, and locked thee in; Good-bye, we said, amid the din Of bells, and wheels, and gasps that burst From that black engine's heart accurst! Good-bye thou saidst—and in my ear The parting tone yet lingers dear— While on thy lips there sat the while A tender, tearful, timorous smile —As if thou wouldst not seem to part With boding sorrow in thy heart. Even now, while sorrowing here I stand, I feel the tremor of thy hand: Was it love's tenderness? or fear —A consciousness that Fate was near? Or jar of nerve from shriek and rasp? —It was at least our final clasp! The guard's shrill whistle brought the close, White steam-balls from the funnel rose; Good-byes repeated, friends drew back; The engine moved along the track, Strong and insensate through the gloom, Deliberately to its doom! As down the platform passed the train, I saw thee, Seraph! once again: The light shone full on eyes and brow —I saw thee as I see thee now! O loveliest picture Earth could claim Set in a carriage window frame! What radiant beauty from thy face Lit up the darkness of the place! It seemed the halo of a saint, But brighter than the Masters paint, A glory finer than the sun —The aureole of Heaven begun! A moment seen! I thank thee, Heaven! For the clear glimpse that then was given— It tarried with me from that day, It tarries with me now alway! It was as if an angel bowed Earthward from a dark thunder-cloud, Then gently, smilingly withdrew While yet you gazed and ere you knew. I charge thee, Memory, hold them fast, Those features as I saw them last,— Brave eyes, sweet lips, with just a trace Of transient sadness on the face, Saintly serenity of brow —How poor is Earth without them now! Thou blessèd Angel! where thou art Is all my hope, is all my heart; And Heaven scarce nearer now can be Since thou art there to plead for me! CLOUDS. Through all the day, in sunshine and in cloud, My heart was weighted with prophetic woe— “Thus,” in the cloud, I dreamt, “will grief o'erflow My smiling plains of joy, and care-weeds crowd My sunny gardens, by young love endowed:” And in the sunshine, “This will shortly go; Let me not trust therein; too well I know To none is constant happiness allowed.”— —Whence come these roseate shores that wide outroll? Those ebon rocks and flowery islets far Make with that amber sea a perfect whole. To love, all things add beauty; nought can mar.— The sunset sweeps misgivings off my soul, And peace drops from the wings of the first star. HYMN FOR THE NEW YEAR. O Lord, Thy creatures cry to Thee For love, and light, and guidance still! Their highest hope Thy face to see, Their utmost aim to do Thy will. Thou wouldst not have us vainly grieve For faults and follies past and gone? Be ours the bitterness to leave And bear the fuller knowledge on. From out the ashes of the Old The phœnix of the New Year springs With possibilities untold In the proud freedom of its wings. High may it soar with us, until On heights of holiness it dies, That other years may higher still On young unwearied pinions rise! We drift upon an unknown sea, On waves that ever nearer draw The borders of eternity, Obedient to unchanging law. And through the night we shrink to hear On that dim shore their dying fall; Till comes the thought to calm our fear, That Thou, O Lord, art over all! TO A FRIEND. Thy work may not be measured; scales and rule Are for the tangible and transient—thou With pain of heart and sweat of brain and brow Pliest thy work with no material tool. Therefore heed not the rating of the fool, Whose blindness to the light would not allow The glory of the sun that's shining now, If within walls he circumscribe thy school. But count thy work in every life that springs Attestive to thy teaching, wheresoe'er On earth it suffers—or in heaven it sings, Owning in part its portion to thy care; And think that round thee may be angel-wings As there are hearts, blessing thee unaware!</field>
