[Chapter I] Now gyneth the devel to wraththen him sore (as aftir scholen ?e herkene &amp; here wel more), whanne that oure lord to helle wente, and took owt Adam with good entente, and also Eve, and ek othere mo, √æat with him he likede forto han tho. and whanne √æe develis behelden this, moche drede and merveille they hadden, j-wis. So, as Aftyrward longe be-Felle, to-gederis they conseilled, the develis, ful snelle, and token hem to-gederis Jn parlement, the maister-develis, be on assent, and seiden: ‚Äúwhat mester man Js he, this, that doth vs here al this distres? we mown not a?ens him maken defens, whanne he is owht Jn owre presens, and bynemeth vs that we scholde haue, and for hym non thing mowen we kepen save. For we supposede, ful verrayly, that non man scholde be born of wommans body, that alle owre they weren be Ryht, but he hem benemeth vs be his myht. Sey, how was this ?oman bore, be whom owre Ryht js thus forlore?‚Äù thanne answerede anothir devel, and, as him thowhte, he answerede wel: ‚Äúwe hauen herd sein be prophecye that god jn erthe here Scholde dye Forto saven the Synneris here, that of Adam and Eve come jn fere. Anon wenten we thanne hem to prove, and evere weren they stedfast jn goddis love, and the more turment we diden hem do, Evere the ferthere they weren vs fro, So that Evere jn here moste peyne To hem aperede he, jn certeygne, and hem comforted so wondirly wel, that owre tormentes greved hem neuere a del, and euere jn here moste distresse he hem deliuerede to Sikirnesse.‚Äù Thus talkydden they √æere al jn fere of thinges that befallen were‚Äî ‚ÄúThat thus from vs hath he taken away thinges that we not kepen ne may. wel knowen ?e alle here wel everychon that jn water he doth hem waschen anon, jn √æe Name of the Fadir and sone &amp; holi gost, whiche that ben of myhtes most, and also hem anoynteth with oynement, where-thorwh owre powere js al j-schent, So that oure part of hem, Jt is don, Tyl that owre Servauntes they becom. and thus owre power he doth away, and so don his mynestres everyday, that jn erthe he hath left here; they don vs ful often wel mochel dere. For they, oure Servantes the[y] ben be Ryht, ?it ouer hem han they so gret myht, that, and they welen oure Servise forsake and onliche to Jesu thanne hem take, alle oure powere, than Js it j-don, and thus we lesen hem Everychon. Moche goodnesse schewed he for man-kynde, that jn this world he wold hym bynde of a wommans body to ben j-bore, to Saven mankynde, that was forlore. and whanne that he j-boren was, we hym assaieden jn every plas, as moche as was jn owre powere, and neuere gilty ne fownden we hym jn non manere, jn hym of oure werkes neuere Ryht nowht, For al that evere we to hym wrowht, But that he wolde deyen to saven man, For jn him hadde we non powere than. Ful mochel cherte hadde he to man, that so mochel peyne suffrede for him than, and hym forto wynnen ageyn, and from vs hem be-reven, jn certeyn. Ful mochel sorwe to vs he wrowhte thorwgh mankynde, that he bowhte.‚Äù thanne anon Spoken they Jn fere of Swiche thinges as greved hem there, of hem that proclamed the tydyng Ferst jn the erthe of his comeng: ‚Äúand whanne we ony tormentes scholde hem do, anon he delyverede hem vs Fro. Therfore wolden we weten ful fayn The beste to done, Jn certayn, how that jn the erthe a child to have that the peple wolde aftyr crave. For he scholde hauen alle connenge of thyng √æat js past and that is comenge, and encense the peple to oure lore, as he dyde that was √æere be-fore, To tellen hem of thinges √æat hadde be and befalle scholden, ful Sikerle. So scholde he √æe peple to vs drawe, For of hym they wolden ben Ryht fawe.‚Äù thanne seiden they amonges hem everichon that swich a child, and they hadden on, wel mochel he scholde hem profyte and torne the peple to here delyte, For fulwel beleved scholde he be For his prophecyes, ful Sikerle. thanne stirte there forth a schrewe anon, and seide amonges hem everichon: ‚ÄúJ haue power Seed forto Sowe jn the erthe on wommen bothe hye &amp; lowe, and j haue on redy at myn assent, that wil Fulfillen myn talent.‚Äù So concentyd they that this ilke schrewe jnto erthe scholde gon anon that threwe Forto Fulfillen that jlke dede, of wheche alle the schrewes token here rede. Now, grete Foles weren they everychon, that amonges hem cowde not knowen on how that god knew wel alle thyng, bothe gynneng, midwardis, and endyng! thus departyd they from here conseylle this werk to be-gynne, with-owten faille. thanne he that seide that he hadde powere on women jn erthe to engendren there, he taryed there non lengere thanne, but cam jnto erthe to this wommanne whiche womman that dyde hym Servise. with hire he anon mette jn prevy gyse, and anon he tempted hire so, that anon sche concentyd hym to, and graunted hym, al that sche cowde o√æer myhte, To don him Servyse bothe day &amp; Nyhte. and hire lord was a worthy man, &amp; moche more good hadde thanne J telle kan. This Riche man hadde moche of worldly good, more thanne ony man tho vndirstood, of Bestes and of other Richesse, of kamailles, of jewelis, &amp; of o√æer worthynesse. This worthy man hadde dowhtren thre, The Fa[y]rest Wommen that myhte be, and a sone, that scholde ben his eyr, bothe a gentilmanly child and a fayr; and alle he hadde be this womman, that √æe devel so mochel part hadde of than. thanne this devel for?at non thing, that Rowhte not of mannes begyleng, and axede of this womman anon how that Best he myhte don hire lord to haue to his partye, hym forto tellen he preyde hire hye. sche answerede: ‚ÄúWith non thing so sone, j-wys, as only be wraththe, with-owten mys; For ryht lyhtleche he wile wroth be, as j the telle now ful sikerle; and √æer-fore wraththe thou myht him sone with the leste thing that thou wilt done.‚Äù thanne wente forth this cursed schrewe anone, and slowgh his bestes alle thus sone, a gret partye of hem jn a nyht. and on the morwen, whanne it was lyht, the pastour aspide that moreygne, and to his lord he wente, ful pleyne, and told hym of that aventure, how his bestes deiden, J ?ow ensure. and whanne that the goode lord herde this, Ful wondirly wroth he was, j-wys, and axede of the pastour tho what Skile his bestes deyden so. the pastour answerede him ageyn: ‚ÄúSire, j ne can not weten, jn certein!‚Äù So belefte he stille alle that day. and whanne the devel this knew &amp; say, that for so lytel he wolde wroth be, thanne was he joyful, wel Sekirle, and thowhte more harm hym to do, be wraththe √æe sonnere to drawen hym to. So that he the nexte nyht jnto his stable, j Sey ?ow ryht, and there ten of his hors slowgh he, the beste that weren jn that contre. and whanne the goodman wiste of this, that al his good wente so amys, anon ryht angry ful sone he was for tho tydynges jn that plas, and a word of anger spak he thore, wheche after repentyd him ful sore, and be-took the devel al the remnaunt, That him be-lefte, petyt &amp; graunt. Whanne that the devel herde him so seyn, thanne was he bothe joyful &amp; fayn, and thowhte to greven him moche more thanne that he dyde ony tyme before. For he made the goode man thanne so wroth, that eche mannes compenye was hym loth. thanne wiste anon the devel ful wel that jn him hadde he part a gret del, and that wel jnowgh he myhte go jnto what partye him lykede tho. Thanne cam the devel to his sone &amp; his eyr, That was bothe so gentyl &amp; Fayr; Vppon A nyht, As he in his bed lay, the devel him strangelede, the sothe to say; and vppon the morwen hym fond ded his owne fadir Jn that same sted. thanne was he Ryht a sorweful man, For that non Recowr ne knew he than, Sethen that his faire sone he hadde lost so, thanne jnto disperaunce fyl he tho. and whanne the devel vndirstod al this, thanne was he joyful, with-owten mis. anon thanne wente he to his wyf, that began al this wo and stryf; jnto an hygh soler he dyde hire go, and abowtes a plawncher a rope caste tho, and Sette a thing thanne vndir hire feet, &amp; √æe Rope abowtes hire nekke teydde askeet; thanne voided sche anon hire stondyng, √æat so thike cursed womman √æere hyre-self heng. whanne the husbonde beheld al this, that his wyf thus ded was, j-wys, and also his sone Jn Swich manere, thanne was he of wondyr hevy chere, that there for sorwe he deyde anon, and thus alle thre, thanne weren they gon. Lo, thus the devel doth be hem alle that jn his Servise ony thing don falle. thanne caste the cursede schrewe a wyle how √æat he myhte his thre dowhtres begyle; and wel he wyste, Jt myhte not be but thorwgh som man of his afynyte. So was there a bacheler Jn the town, that folwed his werkis bothe vpe and down; and hym to this place he dyde propyne these thre faire maidenis forto engyne; and so ofte thedyr he gan to gon, that thussone he hadde ouercomen the ton. and whanne be hire he hadde don folye, the devel anon it schewede openlye, and disclawndred it al the contre, the more schame to hem √æat it scholde be. and jn thyke tyme was tho the lawe, that ho so dyde avowtrye, scholde be slawe and with stones j-browht to the ded, For that was the lawe Jn that sted; and thus with Stoneng scholden they ben schent, but ?if sche were comwne to alle mennes entent. Thanne thus this womman was taken anon, and the man fledde and was agon; and anon was browht to-forn the justice there forto Resceyven hire jewyse. so that of hire they hadden pyte, Swich maner of jewyse be hire to se, For that hire fadyr was so worthy a man, and Jn so schort tyme was mischevyd than. but Natheles nedis ded moste sche be, and thanne thus acordid they, Sykerle, So that for love of hire kynrede be Nyhtes tyme hire stone to dede. thanne jn that contre was there a good man, that of alle these merveilles herde than, and to the tweyne sostren gan he gon hem forto cownseillen with anon. and there anon he spak hem tylle, and axede how this misaventure befille‚Äî ‚ÄúOf ?owre fadyr And modyr Jn Fere, of ?owre brothir and ?oure Soster dere?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe nete Neuere, Sire, Jn certeyn, but ?if that God vs hate, ful pleyn, and this torment Suffreth vs to haue; we knowen non othyr, so god vs saue!‚Äù thanne seide this goodman to hem tho: ‚ÄúForsothe, ?e seyn mys bothe two, For god hatede nevere creature, but Js misplesid, J ?ow enswre, whanne ony Synnere doth him hate Owthir for ony thing with him debate.

Thus the covenaunt was fenyssched there, be-twene the kyng and merlyn jn fere. gret joye maden they jn that cyte of here kyng so ?ong jn his degre, that so worthy a man of armes he was, and therto so hardy jn eche a plas. so that for joye of that solempnite the worthy Burgeys of that cyte a qwyntyn they reryd there besyde jn a fayr medewe that jlke tyde, the ?onge knyhtes to bowrdeyen there with scheldes hangeng abowten here swere. this revel lasted Fully viij dayes with grete feste, as this storye sayes. and whanne the feste was al j-do, To londone ward the kyng gan go, there to abyden his parlement, at halwenmasse to ben holden present. thanne weren they sent fore everychon that homage and fewte scholden don. So √æat som partye comen at his sonde, and som partye hit dyde with-stonde. thanne sente the kyng to hem ageyn that they scholden hit amenden, certeyn, o√æer ellis he wolde hym-self ful blyve, ?if god √æerto hym Sente his lyve. Thus sente kyng [Arthewr] Forth Ryht anon, and bad Sire vlphyn &amp; sire bretel gon To kyng Ban of Baynok ful blyve and sethen to kyng Boors, his brother be wyve: and evere they wylen his love crave owther his Frenschepe Forto have, That to hym they comen jnto grete breteygne, at al halewen masse feste, with-owten leyne. Thanne wenten forth these tweyne knyhtes these two kynges to seken owt-ryhtes. these kynges emporyssched weren jn vyrown Jn tyme of Vter Pendragown. thus passeden the knyhtes ouer the se, Tyl jnto lytel breteygne they comen, certeinle; and thorwh a place of desert they wente, That distroyed and brend was, veramente. Thanne comen they to Anothir cyte, that boorges in berry is clepyd, Sekyrle, whiche that kyng clawdas of desert hyt kalanged openly and apert. this kyng clawdas of which j ?ow telle, anothyr castel kalanged ful snelle, whiche that kyng ban hadde there sette with-jnnen his lond, with-owten lette. kyng clawdas gan evere hym withseye, and seyde the Lond was his, jn feye, where-vppon the castel stood; he wolde hyt haven for evel o√æer good. and kyng Ban than answeryd ageyn, and seyde hit was neuere his, jn certeyn. So that thorwh this, grete werre began; but kyng Ban wolde leven hit for non man, that the castel he dede vpe make, owther for drede owther for wrake. thus began gret hate, werre, &amp; envye, betwixen tho two kynges, Sekyrlye. This werre al here lyve dyde laste. So that this clawdas jnto Ban his rem paste, and hym defyede jn many a d[e]gre, and jn that Lond dyde grete adversyte Jn Townes that vnwalled were; Sone on fyre he sette hem there, of wheche he took many grete pelages; the peple he Slowh and dyde Owtrages, For he was with-owten pyte. but as towching to the castel, Sykyrle, that kyng ban hadde areryd there, he ne hadde non myht to don hyt non dere. This castel kyng ban hadde Stuffed wel With Seriauntes and arblasteris everydel. and √æere-jnne hadde he put an old capteyn, hos name was gracyen, with-owten leyn. and on of Bannes sones with gracyen was, that Baynyn was clepyd jn that plas. this Baynyns was sethen of gret worthynesse, a worthy knyht, and of gret prowesse; more thanne at this tyme √æe Storye doth [not] spelle. but now of kyng ban j schal ?ow telle, that ful wroth &amp; ful angry was For the harm he hadde jn many a plas. and whanne he knew the certeynte, To-gyderis he gaderyd his meyne a?ens kyng clawdas forto fyhte, for alle passages he knew ful ryhte. Whanne these tweyne ostes scholden mete, To-gederis to Fyhten they wolden not lete. So that there was ful gret mortalyte on bothe partyes thanne, certeynle. and so moche peple Slowh this kyng ban, and dissemed the membres of many a man, that a man myhte han seyn jn the feld hepes as of Swyn o√æer of schepe lyn ded. So that Fawht kyng Ban &amp; his meyne, That kyng clawdas fledde &amp; his compeyne, and loste al his harneys and his Pelage, that he to-fortymes took be owtrage, and the presoners rescued weren everychon. on anothir partye entryd kyng boors anon, that half-Brothyr was to kyng Ban, jnto kyng clawdas Lond entrede he than, and √æere brende and dyde distrocciown Abowten Al His Lond Jn Vyrown Jnto the cyte of desert; thedyr he brend ful sone and apert, and that lond distroyede al abowte, that nowher for hym non man myhte rowte. So gret distrocciown there he dede, that jn twenty myle of lengthe &amp; brede No man jn that Lond loggen myhte, To liggen drye be day ne be nyhte, but ?if vndir roche o√æer vndir erthe hit were, cowde no man drye loggen hym there. So was kyng clawdas emporysched there tho, that he ne wyste what he myhte do. So on the kynges dorste he non more werre make, lest hit scholde hym torne to Sorwen and wrake. thus fownden they this lond distroyed &amp; brent, they that on kyng Arthewris message went, and merveylled mochel of this thing as jn the contre they paste rydyng. So ryden they forth, with-owten les, Tyl they comen to √æe castel of Trebes, That kyng Ban there dyde arere, From his enemyes to defenden him every-where. Jn this castel qwene eleyne was, kyng bannes wyf jn that plas, and therto the Fairest Lady was sche that owher was jn ony contre, and but of ?ong age, the sothe to say, but xvj ?er ?it be that day, and but lytel whyle wedded was sche kyng Boors hire soster wedded, sykerle, a worthy lady jn alle wyse, as ony man on erthe cowde devyse. whanne Vlphyn and Bretel comen to trebes, aftyr kyng Ban they axeden, with-owten les. they seyden, he was gon to parlement to his brothyr, kyng Boors, verament. and whanne they wysten he was not there, of qwene eleyne they token here leve in fere. So armed Ryden they forth anon, For the contre that they scholde by gon was perylows forto passen by, as j ?ow Seye, sires, certeynly, For mysdoeris jn that contre. and many mo Scholden there be, nere drede of √æe two kynges so ryhte that on hem don reddure anon with myhte. For ?if ony man that they cowden aspye, And he were taken with felonye, anon to jewyse he Scholde be do and ben distroyed for evere mo. Whanne these knyhtes from Trebees weren gon, Vlphyn and Bretel to-gederys alon, and er fyve myles they hadden past, vij knyhtes there they Syen jn hast, that weren of kyng clawdas meyne, that theke pas they kepten, Sykerle, and weren repeyred owt of desert tho, there what to geten that they myhten also. and whanne the Sevene knyhtes √æat √æer were Syen Vlphyn and bretel come rydyng there, ‚Äúbehold,‚Äù quod the vij knyhtes thanne, ‚ÄúSe on what hors √æat comen these menne; and but we letten hem the weye, we ben but cowardes, be my feye; For they ben not of this contre, Nethyr Here Armes We Knowen not, sekyrle.‚Äù ‚ÄúSertes,‚Äù quod on to anothyr thanne, ‚Äúthey semen bothe welfareng menne, bothe on horsbak and ek on foote, they seme good men, wel j woote. and ?if o√æer mennes Servantes that they be, Thanne a good man Serven they, Sykyrle. therefore hem to dispoylle let vs now hye, For √æer-of hauen we nede gret, ful Sykirlye. here hors and here harneys bothe vs nedyth to han, ben they neuere so lothe.‚Äù Thussone on of hem prekyd owt From alle his Felawes (he was so prowd), and a?ens these messengeris gan he ryde, jn a gret haste that ylke tyde, and seyde: ‚Äúlordynges, of whens ben ?e, whom Seken ?e jn this contre? and whethyr that ?e Serven kyng Ban owther kyng Bors, his brothyr, telle vs now than. and ?yf with kyng clawdas that ?e be, thanne scholen ?e passen whyder so wylen ?e.

So that Schepyd they weren, bothe lest &amp; mest, and esyly over pasten with-owten tempest, of which mater this Storye maketh an ende, and Forth to kyng Artheur now doth hyt wende, that js at londone jn gret Bretaygne, that logres tho was clepyd, jn certaygne. [Chapter IX] Now Scheweth Forthere this Storye that from Arthewr the messengeris gonnen hye, and stuffeden thanne every garnesown, every good cyte, and every town, with arblasteris and seriawntis also; thus merlynes comandement dyde they tho. For he knew alle tho that trewe were, lik as this Storye Reporteth here, For merlyne knew ful wel that compeyne, that be hem Treson scholde neuere non be. and whanne they hadden thus j-don, thanne to hem cam merlyne anon, and seide they hadden ryht wel j-do. thanne tolden they to merlyne vnto how that be the weye assaylled they were, and hou of vij knyhtes they deliuered hem there, ek with the two kynges j-spoken also, and how here londys they hadde deliuered tho To tweyne barouns of that contre, and the tokene of the ryng also tolden hee. Anon seide merlyne to kyng Arthewr thanne: ‚ÄúGoth, ordeyne ?ow to meten these worthy menne, For thin owne men ful Syker they be, and Born of hygh lynage, ful Sykerle, and ek here wyves Jn that same wyse hyghe Born as ony man kan devyse.‚Äù thanne answeryd the kyng to merlyne ageyne: ‚ÄúAs thou me redest, j wyl don, certeyne.‚Äù thanne quod merlyne jn alle haste: ‚Äúthat the weyes ben clensid ful faste, and √æerto alle the maidenis that √æou miht gete hem to meten dawnsing jn that strete, &amp; thus with songe &amp; dawnsyng with-owten √æe town hym so to meten in merie processiown, and thanne ?oure-self with alle ?oure chevalrye ek hem to meten ful worschepfullye.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, goode merlin,‚Äù quod Artheur the kyng, ‚Äúwhanne mai j be seker of here comeng?‚Äù ‚Äúa sondai next comeng, er √æe owr of Tyerce, hidyr scholen thei comen bothe heyl &amp; ferce.‚Äù whanne that kyng Arthewr vndirstood al this, thanne aftir merlines wil he wrowhte, j-wys, and merline him tawhte what he scholde do, and hou to the kynge he scholde speken vnto, that jn non wise jnterupt scholde he not ben Jn non thing that he Scholde don other sen. Vppon this him ordeyned Artheur the kyng a?ens these kynges to gon encowntryng. thus abyden they stille til vppon the sonday. thanne myht me sen men there jn good aray: the kyng Artheur &amp; al his Baronye, therchebisschope of dover with his clergye, thus with processioun they hem metten, sykerle. thanne gret kysseng &amp; joye there men myhten se. thus toward the cyte passeden they there, where as dawnsyng many maidenis were with many karoles &amp; ryht merye song, at that tyme was these maidenis among. and thus thorugh the cyte thei gonne to ride To the grete towr that ilke tyde. Anon as these kynges to √æe paleis weren browht, grete jewelis and ?iftis sone weren vpe sowht and to the kinges presentyd there; also cowrseris, palfreyes, &amp; with destrere, ek robes, and armures bothe goode &amp; riche To these kynges he ?af and to o√æer j-lyche. and al this wrowht he be merlines cownsaille, For aftyr hit dede hym gret availle. So that gret love he gat him there Of Riche and powre thanne Every-Where, and of hem that neuere hym sye Toforn tyme ne aftyr with here eye. Ful mochel merveylleden the peple tho whens that alle tho jewelis comen fro, and jn so schort time hit was j-don, bothe to hye and to lowe √æere riht anon. So that eche man jn his degre kyng Artheuris man swor forto be, and for nothing hym Neuere to faylle jn pes, in werre, nethir jn bataille. Whanne that these kynges jn √æe cite were, daunsyng of ladies Syen thei there, Torneyeng of Bacheleris ?onge, that alday lasted jnto evensonge. more ouer alle the stretis of the cyte with clothis of Sylk weren hanged, sikerle. and bothe fayr wedyr and cler hyt was, For nethyr rein ne hayl √æat day √æere nas. and alle the stretys with lampes hanged were, and euerich lampe ful of Bawm was there, whiche that brenden so Swetely, that al the cyte √æere-offen savourede, trewly, So that the swete odowr smellyd myhte han be half a myle thanne, ful certeinle. So that the barouns forth wenten in fere To the chyf mynstre anon ryht there. there met weren they with processioun, with cros, Baneris, and gomfanoun. Therchebisschope the masse sang, veramente, and aftyr masse to paleys they wente, the thre kynges al jn Fere with alle the baronage √æat was there, where as manye worthy viandes weren dyht √æerwith the kynges to serven, as hit was ryht. and alle thre kynges to-gederis they sete, with hem therchebisschope, as hit was mete; at on table alle J-Served they were with rial deyntes whiche weren there. thanne weren there two ?onge knyhtes that thyke day the halle serveden outrihtes with sire kay, sire Vlphin, and sire Bretel; that day they deden wondirly wel. the names of thes knyhtes so ?onge J schal ?ow declaren Jn Englysch tonge. the ton hyhte Lucans the Botelers, the tothir sire Gyrfles, a knyht ful fers. thus with these knyhtes the halle served was with gret deyntes thike day jn that plas. Aftyr noon was vpe set the qwyntyn, the ?onge knyhtes √æere justed wel and fyn, and Boordeieden there alle theke day, and aftyrward to torneyeng, with-owten nay. So weren they devyded on partyes tweyne, on eche side vij hundred, jn certeingne, of whyche of the rem of Baynoic, vtterlye, thre hundred weren in that compenye. and whanne these parties assembled were, alle thre kynges weren they there. and mochel of the clergye √æere was also, and of astronomers that jn √æe rewm was tho. ?it vndir hem alle cowden they not telle on whiche syde the better befelle, Sauf only merlyne he cowde declare, whiche side the bettere scholde han thare. Thus the thre Kynges And therchebysschope tho at Fenestris and wyndowes lokeden tho, and hou to-gederys they gonnen torneye, ek hou that here hors gonnen for to neye, and hou that the erthe hyt denede also, So faste to torneyeng gonn they to go. Thanne thus whiles they torneyed there, Jnto a renge aperyd thanne there Sire Gyrfle?, the sone of cardwelle, vppon a stede that was stowt &amp; felle; jnto that renge he rod ful faste. &amp; a?ens hym cam on atte laste: a knyht of Baynoic, that hyht Ladmas, with sire Gyrfles mette jn that plas; and assone as they to-gederis mette, Grete strokes on ech other there sette; with sperys and scheldes toforn here breest To-gedires they mettyn at here Treest. and so sore to-gederis they ronnen there, that ech vppon other barst his spere, For worthy knyhtes they weren bothe two, and eche be hym-self desirede also: the toon desired worschepe, trewelye, The to√æer richesse and Seygnourye. So sore they torneyeden togederis thanne, that hem thowhte the brayn was owt of h[er]e panne, and ek the eyen owt of here hed, So sore they torneyed jn that sted. and ech of hem to erthe o√æer there bar, that jn Swowneng stille they lyen thar. So that the peple wenden, √æat stoden abowte, that bothe hadden ben ded, with-owten dowte. For so crwel a fyht Syen they neuere ere be-twixen two men that knyhtes were. Thussone to-broken the renges anon; to rescwen these knyhtes wenten they ful son. there on partye with anothyr to-gederis gonne mete, that on eyther partye lay jn the strete. ek so sore to-gederis metten they there, that eche man on othyr brak his spere. whanne that here sperys to-broken were, anon here swerdis they pulden owt there. So that there a melle began ful strong, betwixen tho knyhtes hem among. ?yt was there thanne anothyr knyht, that ful merveillously bar hym in fyht, that Lucans le boteler was his name, cosin germayn to Gyrfles, a man of fame. This Lucans so on gan taken there, that bothe hors and knyhtes he gan to fere. For so harde he took on thanne, that his strok ne dorsten abyden non manne. he rente the helmes of hedis adown, here scheldes caste ouer here arsown, and swiche maistryes werken √æere he began, that of hym merveillede many a man. and so deden these kynges thre, and of hym merveilleden jn many degre. Longe lasted the torneyeng that Tyde at Londone faste by temses syde. and ?it knew non man the bettyr partye, ho √æe victorye scholde hauen, sykyrlye. For so many goode men there were here myht to preven on bothe sides √æere. whanne Gyrfles and his felawe vpe weren sette and on horsbak √æere, with-owten lette, Whanne they Aventyd Weren Jn that plas, a?en they torneyeden with-jnne litel spas. thanne sire Gyrfles and sire lwcans jn Fere Ful grete maystryes begonnen they there, and of hem of Baynoic goten they lond, and from here place remeved hem, j vndirstond. whanne that this they of Baynoyc Sye, that here Feleschepe gonnen so forto flye, they comen to rescwen hem with alle here myht, that toforn not ne hadden comen jn fyht. thanne comen of Arthewris thre hundred knyhtes a?ens hem of Baynoyc √æere anon ryhtes. and thus they entermellyd bothe jn fere, tyl that merveillous werkyng maden they there; for so sore to-gederis gonnen they ryde, that here speris to-borsten jn that tyde. and whanne here speres toborsten were, anon eche man his swerd drowh owt √æere. and √æere began ful gret Tornement of tho worthy knyhtes, verament. For a man the sothe myhte knowe, the worthynesse of knyhtes al be rowe, and ek of ?onge knyhtes that √æere were, that lerned to torneyen with scheld and spere. but of alle othere jn that plas Sire Gyrfle? &amp; Sire lwcans gonne hem pas. Whanne hyt was comen to the owr of noon, Syre kay with xvj felawes there cam anon, that ?it non strok j-smeten they hadde; thussone jnto the reng √æere he hem ladde. So that √æe ferste they gonne there mete, down they hem boren a-myd the strete. So sore they justed vppon that grownde, that here speris to-borsten √æat ylke stownde. and whanne here speris to-broken were, anon here swerdis they pulden owt there. that so sore they fyhten begonne, and fowhten, whiles they hadden ony sonne, that sire kay on his partye hadde the gre, on √æe tother side Gyrfle? &amp; lwcans, sykerle. thanne wenten these knyhtes tho jn fere Forto aventen hem owt of √æe place there. thanne to that resorted √æere anon ryht of Baynoyc Lordis of ryht gret myht, hos names j schal ?ow telle, and ?e wylen herkene to my spelle. There was Vsmerawnt of √æe Roche, ful prest in age, and Gawnes de bloy, &amp; Vryens of √æe forest savage, also Belyas Amorews of maydyn castel, and Flawndres le Blans, and Graciens the Lel, and Blyes de la kasse, and Bliobens of desert with melyadus √æe bloys &amp; madyeus of crispes, apert, and placydas the gays with hem, trewelye; alle these to torneyeng comen jn compenye. whanne this fresch peple cam to tornement, There they so torneyeden, verament, So that non man dorste hem there abyde; So sore they torneyeden jn that tyde. and whanne Sire kay be-held al this, that here lond his felawes hadden lost, j-wys, and there aventyng as he was &amp; with hym his felawes jn that plas behelden hem of Baynoyc lond putten his felawes to √æe wers, j vndirstond, Thussone √æere hasted hym thanne syre kay And His Felyschepe With Hym, Jn Fay, and prekeden jnto the grettest pres that he myhte fynden, with-owten les, and with hym his feleschepe in compenye. there gonnen they sore to torneyen, trewelye, So that but a lytel whyle hadden they ben there, that they of Baynoyc Scomfyt they were. thus wrowht Sire kay jn that Turnement, that his Name declared was, verament, as this storye here-after schal declare, hos that there-aftyr wil loken thare. Syre kay, that of his modyr neuere norsched was, but of anothyr womman jn dyvers plas, a tach of his norse there he cawhte, that of hym geten myhte hyt be nowhte. ?it his modyr a worthy lady was, and moche worschepe cowde jn every plas, and √æerto sche was ful of Bownte and ful of gentrye in eche degre. but this Sire kay a custom hadde, that he ne rowhte to speken good o√æer badde. ?yt he ne spak hit for non velonye, but moche √æat he seide was but folye. For often-tymes they that herd hym speke, on lawgheng they musten sone owt breke ek for disport and his Folye, that jn his speche they fownden, trewelye. And √æerto a?enward ?it was he the beste Felawe that myhte be. whanne sire kay cam to tornement, as to-forn time han ?e herd present, and Sire Ladmas, that ful wel hadde J-do vppon kyng arthewrs men ?it thedirto, and Sawh his Felawes put to the flyht, whiche so him grevede anon √æere ryht‚Äî whanne that Sire kay al this beheld, that his Felawes forsaken hadde √æe feeld, Ful Sorweful he was thanne jn his herte, and Forth on horsbak he gan to sterte To Sire Ladmas jn that pres, and of his Torneyeng he made him ses, and made him to meven owt of √æat place, there as to-forn tyme ful bold he wace, and so sore smot hym jn the Scheld, that bothe hors and man fyl jn the feld; and at √æe same strok there also Sire Graciens trebens to erthe gan go. So with that cowrs he brak his spere, and anon his swerd he drowh owt there, and rescwed his felawes echon. thussone his name discried was anon, how that alle his felawes socowrede he, that Scomfyt they wenden forto han be. thanne torneden they alle a?en jn fere, and of al that day ne dyden not so wel √æere. These jostes beheld wel Artheur √æe kyng, kyng Ban and kyng Boors, with-owten lesyng, and behelden the chevalrye of syre kay, that he there dyde that ylke day, and seiden he was a worthy knyht, vayllaunt &amp; vysable jn every fyht. and whanne Lwcans the Botelers Sawgh kay so do, hym forto helpe hym nede not to go. Thanne took He His Hors With His spores Anon, and jnto the grettest pres he gan to gon, and smot Syre Bloys so sore there, that al on peces to-barst his spere, and to the grownde him bar down ryht, and his swerd owt drowgh √æere forto fyht. thanne began √æere gret Torneyenge here felawes to socowr forto brynge. Thanne cam Sire Gyrfle?, armed ful bryht, as faste prekinge as that he myht, and Sawgh there Blyobers &amp; his felawes tweye, that abowten Sire kay weren, trewelye. and with here swerdes on hym they leyden faste, that wondyr hit was he myhte hit laste, For grete nede of socour there hadde he, For he was but on a?ens hem thre, and thike thre √æe best men were of Baynoykes meyne √æat was there. thanne mette he there with placydes, and his helm to-barst jn that pres. Aftyr Rod he to Blyobers, that thike tyme was bothe stordy &amp; fers, and smot evene a-myddes √æe scheld, that he there fyl doun jn the feld, and drowh owt his swerd anon thanne, and smot sire placydes so on √æe panne, So that sore astoned √æere he was, and from his hors fyl down jn that plas. Thanne what tyme Syre kay beheld al this, vp ful sone he hym dressed, j-wys, and beheld sire Gyrfle?, his socourer, and thowhte that kyndenesse to qwyten owher. So from that day evere aftyr-warde they loveden to-gederis ful strong &amp; harde; Al the whyle they leveden here, myht non man departin hit fer ne nere. Whanne S[i]re Gyrfles Sire kay rescwed hadde, and thens as he lay thanne forth hym ladde, thanne aspyde Sire kay on √æat hyht ?eroas, that hym sore anoyede jn that plas. anon his Swerd Sire kay owt drowghe, and, schortly to seyne, there hym he slowghe. thanne be-gan there gret noyse &amp; cry on the tothyr partye there, certeinly. thanne comen they thedyr fast prekynge, and ek on sire kayes syde, with-owten lesinge. So that gret melle there began, that hurt and anoyed was many a man, er alle fyve felawes rescwed were, owthyr er to-gederis they mo[w]n semblen there. but whanne to-gederis they weren alle fyve, wel mochel deseyse they wrowhte ful blyve. and ?if ?e wil knowen whiche fyve they be, J schal ?ou here declaren, ful sekerle: Ferst Vlphyn, Bretel, and Syre kay √æere, Sire Gyrfle?, and Sire lwcans √æe botelere. and whom so evere √æese fyve metten jn place, to therthe they wente, ther nas non o√æer grace, For so wel these Fyve gonnen hem be-stere, merveylleng to alle tho that there were. and how they myhte so longe endure, These thre kynges merveilleden, j ?ow Ensure. So that thus ther Was Ful strong melle on bothe partyes there thanne, Sykerle. and gret poyntes of armes √æere was j-do, and tyl hyt was even, hyt lasted tho. thanne comen these thre kynges adown this Torneye to breken al and som. So that they comen jn-to the place there as this Torneyeng al day was, and helden bothe partyes parygal. Anon thanne comen they jn with-al, For they cowde not wel declare on whiche partye the gre schold fare. and there departed the Torneye anon, So that eche knyht to his jn hom gan gon. and the kynges wenten forth to evensong, and aftyr to here Soper gonne they fong. and whanne the Soper was j-do, of this tornement thanne spoken they tho, and ho that best bar him thar, and whiche of armes √æat wysest war. thanne anon hem answerede there kyng Ban, &amp; seide: ‚Äúxvj knyhtes j have here than that jn this Torneyeng bettere han doon thanne alle the remnaunt everichon, and on this partye heyhte there were, For stronge &amp; harde they peyned hem here, and many merveillous armes dyden they, mo thanne at this tyme j kan wryte o√æer sey.‚Äù so vppon this long weren they jn talkyng, and √æanne atte laste for the gre ?eveng.

For more of this scholen ?e han encres, thanne oni of ?ow kan seyn, with-owten les.‚Äù thanne delyverede him √æe kyng his ryng anon, and √æer-with forth merlyne gan to gon, and be Blaysie, his maister, he took √æe weye, and of alle thinges tolde him, Sekerlye: that jnto litel Breteignes he scholde go; of the message eke he told him also; whiche that Blasye wrot in that throwe; and elles how scholde we hit knowe? Thus merlyne from Blase departed anon, and forth on his message he gan to gon, and dyde his message al in good tyme, For he was √æere he wolde er the morwen at pryme, and tolde sire Leownces the kynges wylle, and the kynges ryng took hym vntylle. there they beleved hym anon, and deden al that was forto don, And senten Anon bothe fer and Ny, and faire retenu to gaderen, trewly. So that with-jnne fowrty myles abowte thedyr they gadered with gret rowte, so that they weren to-forn the cyte viij dayes to-forn cristemasse, Sykerle; thanne good warde putten to √æe townes alle that to the tweyne kynges be riht schold falle. jn that on hold they putten a lady Bryht, that worthy lady was and of gret myht: the cyte of gawnes kepte sche thanne and with hyre ful many a worthy manne. Ek Phareens there merlyne preyde also that al his power he wolde do, and that he hym grawntyd, ful sekerly, jnto al his power, ful vtterly. on the to√æer syde, jnto Baynoyc cyte they putten a man of gret degre, Sire raier, the Lord of Hawt mure, a worthy knyht and vaillaunt, j ?ou ensure. and jn the castel of Trebes they putten Sire graciens, with-owten les, the whiche was godsone to kyng Ban. and jn that castel with him hadde he than Two sostren of Raynes, the worthiest knyht √æat √æere was be est o√æer west. For it was the strengest castel of alle √æat contre be many a del. and at mowntloyr, √æe castel of kyng Boors, that was don kept with strengthe &amp; foors: Sire placydes, that was a worthy knyht, That castel he kepte bothe day &amp; Nyht. And whanne alle these ordenaunces weren jdo, merlyne with his meyne forth gan to go, and that was be the tyme of Nyht, For theke tyme the mone schon ful bryht. and merlyne condeyede hem the weye From alle enemyes, as he wel kowde, jn feye. and to the se he Browht hem ful sone; there Faste to schepe gonne they gone. and kyng Arthewr, vppon the to√æer syde To bataille hym arayede the same tyde, also prevyly as he cowde thanne do. So that moche peple him cam vnto: bencheson of tho ?iftes grete that he hem ?af, they wolde not lete. Also o√æer peple to hym comen that throwe, For that they wolden kyng Artheur knowe; ek other peple hym kam forto se For that they herden of his gret bownte. So that whanne to-gederis j-sembled they were, x thousend on horsbak redy they were; For foot-men thedyr wolde he non haue, for his meyne and vytaille √æat he wolde save. and on √æe to√æer syde there comen a-down charyettes with vytaylle alle jn virown evene aftyr merlynes ordenaunce; So was hit don, with-owten variaunce. and ful prevyly alle j-logged they were jn a lawnde besyde Bredigan there; For that was on the prevyest place that jn that contre owher wace. and whanne this was al j-do, merveillously wrowht kyng artheur tho, whiche that merlyne Hyt plesed ful Wel, whanne he hit knew, his wyt, echedel. For anon as that they logged were, alle the weyes be-sette he there, that non man therby Scholde passe jnto his lond, nethir more ne lasse, but ?if he were taken and to-forn him browht, Er that ony jnto his rewm forthere sowht. For he kepte that non aspye his rewn scholde entren, trewelye, For to certefyen his enemyes what was his ordenaunce o√æer his devys. For there kyng Arthewr charged alle tho that to hym belonged vnto, that non man thyke pas scholde ryde, tyl hyt were aftyr kandelmasse tyde; and ho √æat dide a?ens his comandement, To deth he scholde gon, verament. So that stylle they helden hem every man, where-offen √æe comune peple merveylleden than. So that thus prevyly this was wrowht, &amp; sauf √æe kynges cownseille wist non man nowht. Now leveth this storye of this mater, and aftyr of √æe vj kynges hit speketh here, that at carliown discomfyted were, as √æat to-forn tyme ?e han herd told here. Thanne here-aftyr Reherseth this Book, ho so wele here there-aftyr look, what morneng that maden these vj kynges, For they hadden so lost alle here thynges and al the harneis that they hadde, and al that here meyne with hem ladde. So that they sworen and maden affyance there-on to ben avenged jnto √æe vttrawnce; For er glad scholden ney neuere be, Tyl they weren avenged, certeinle, bothe of kyng Artheur &amp; ek on merlyn, the wheche they clepeden his devyn, be whom they losten al here good; thus al amased homward they ?ood. and for that somme myhten ne√æer riden ne go, hom jn a leter weren they lad tho. so that smale Jornes forth they wente, Tyl jnto here lond they comen presente. so that they soiournede, tyl they hol were; &amp; with-jnne a monthe a parlement hadden they there jn a march that be-twene engelond was and scotland, so that hit stood in √æe middes of √æe plas. and this was the ende of the parlement, that every man scholde don his entent And Senden abowte in-to eche contre To alle here Frenschepis, where so they be, and that [eche] of hem to othyr swere redy forto ben with scheld &amp; spere To dryven kyng Artheur owt of his lond, and hit to Sesyn jnto here owne hond. So that they token day of assemble that ost to-gederis forto be Jn a feld besydes Bredygam; thus herto assentyd every man. Thanne thus departyd the parlement. Anon every man abowtes faste sent, So that to hem repeyrede there anon the dewk of cambenye &amp; othyr manyon. Fyve thousende men he browhte with hym, that jn bataylle weren bothe stowt &amp; grym. thanne cam there forth Tradelynaws, that kyng of Northgales tho he was, with vj thousend of Fyhteng men. and on √æe tothyr partye come th[e] kyng clariouns then with thre thousend men also. thanne √æe kyng of .c. knyhtes cam tho, and with hym foure thousende he browhte. thanne the kyng of orkanye owt hem sowhte wit[h] vij thousend jn his compenye. and aftyr hym carados of strangor faste gan hye, that vij thousend men of armes hadde thanne cam kyng Newtris, &amp; with hym ladde Sixe thousend men, that weren not badde. hym Folewede kyng Ydyers of Cornewaylle with vj thousend men, with-owten faylle. So that smale jornes they gonne to ryde The contre to Serchen jn that Tyde. thanne here aspyes abowte? faste they ?ood, to weten how hit with kyng Artheur stood. but they that √æe march &amp; the weyes kepte, Fulsone to these aspyes they lepte, and token hem, and to kyng Arthewr sente, &amp; anon to presoun they ful sone wente, So that Tydynges a?en boren they non. thanne jn here jorne forth gonne they gon, Tyl that they alle j-logged were vndir √æe castel of Bredygam √æere. For thanne they wenden alle han wonne, certein, but hit was alto-gederis jnveyn. thanne senten they here forreyerys jnto √æat contre, but ful lytel fowndyn they, Sekirle; For al that good was lad before jnto castelis and jnto cites thore. this was wrowht be cownseyl of kyng Ban and Ek of kyng Boors, a ful wis man. Whanne that they aspyden al this, that the contre thus was warned, j-wis, anon they Fireden, an gonne to brenne, and al the contre distroied thanne. So that owt of here owne Lond they hadden vetaylle, as hit scheweth here with-owten Faille; So that of vytaylle they hadden plente, as For swich a tyme hit longed forto be. and whanne to-gederis was al this semble, Fowrty thousend weren acounted, certeinle, of clene pyked men to fyhte, ek worthy werrours and of gret myhte. Thus endeth here now of here gaderyng, and speketh how merlyn browht to Arthewr √æe kyng Socour and helpe owt of lytel Bretayngne, as here-after scholen ?e heren, jn certeigne, and what meyne √æat merlin with him browhte owt of litel breteigne, where he hem sowhte. Forthere tellyth this Storye here how jn litel Breteygne merlyne spedde there, what be Leownces of Paerne, j vndirstond, and Sire Fariens, and Antony of √æat lond, that of Baynoyc tho steward was. alle to the port comen they in that plas, and jnto here Schepis they entred anon; thanne jnto grete breteigne sone gonne they gon. and it is good reson that ?e vndirstonde why that hit was clepyd Breteigne Londe. j do ?ow to wetene here every man that aftyr √æe distroccioun of Troye, as j kan, hit behapped that two kynges departyd thenne For drede of gre?ois, as this doth kenne, lest they wolden hem han slayn; this caused these kynges forto gon thayn. These tweyne kynges with gret meyne thens departed ful hastyle, of wheche the ton Brewt he hyhte, that was bothe gentyl &amp; worthy knyhte, that jn his lyve he bylte with gret joye a fair cyte, that was clepid new troye; bencheson that owt of troye cam he, Troye was clepid that jlke cyte. Ek the contre thanne clepyd hit was after Brewt Breteigne in that plas. thanne long aftyr, whanne Brewt was ded, anon kam there a kyng jn his sted, that Logryvs was his ryht name, a worthy man and of gret fame, that mochel amendyd this cyte, bothe Towres and walles, Sykerle. and whanne thus amended was √æat town, thanne wolde he ?even hit a Sewrnown, and after Logryvs Logres cald hit he, that jn gret breteigne stont, Sykerle. So that this name dured forth, in feye, long aftyr that Artheur gan deye. thanne aftyr the deth of lawncelot, that kyng Bannes sone was, wel j wot, hyt happede that a gret mortalyte jn that lond was after, certeinle, bothe of Barowns and comunes also, that thike tyme deyden so tho. and for √æe grete Los that they hadden thanne, Bloye breteygne hit was clepyd of every manne. and why bloye, j preye now the? leve sires, for this cause, parde: For here hertes bothe blw and blak they were, eche man for here frendis dethis there, that they losten be mischaunce and be synne; thus every Frend from othir gan twynne. Now hauen ?e herd declared, jn certaygne, why hit was clepyd the Bloye Bretaigne. The tothyr prince that owt of troye cam, Hyghte Corynaws, a Ful myghty man. this corinaus was comen of Jeawntes lynage, a worthy knyht and of hygh parage. So that he aryvede fast by that contre, that thike tyme the name breteigne scholde be. therto he was a merveyllous knyht, bothe long and strong and of gret myht. there arered he bothe townes and castel, Strongly j-bylt &amp; wondyrly wel; and aftyr hym the lond he dide don kalle Cornwaylle jn breteygne of gret &amp; smalle. So that thorwh hym comen jeauntes mo, that to Bretouns moche harme diden tho, as that here-aftyr now scholen ?e here to alle ?oure wyttes declared more clere. of the merveilles that aftyr befalle, j hope to declaren to ?ow alle, ?if that god wile granten me grace &amp; myht, helthe of Body, and myn eyen syht, owt of Frensch jnto englysch now wyl j fonde hit to drawen, that ?e moun vndirstonde. Therfore for herry Louelyche that ?e preye, that til this be endid, he may not deye, but lyven jn helthe and prosperite; Now, good lord, grante hit moot so be. Forth to my mater now wyl j pase of merlyne &amp; his meine, √æat jn the se wase, the whiche he browhte owt of lytel breteigne, as here-aftyr declared ?e scholen here more pleyne. Thanne anon as a-ryved they were, vppon the se banke he bad hem there. thanne merlyne comaunded every man here harneys al forto trossen than; For that he wolde For non thing that they maden non taryeng. But they holden here ryht weye Thyder as merlyn wolde hem gye, Tyl that to kyng Arthewr they comen ful ryht, there that he lay with al his myht. So that hym they foleweden alle, what so evere there-of myhte falle. So that be the Fyfthe dayes ende To √æe Forest of Bredygam gonne they wende, where as logged was Arthewr the kyng, that made gret joye of his comeng, and logged hem among his ost ful son, and amonges hem every day gan he to gon. thanne aftyr viij dayes j-rested they were, and merlyne here vetaylle departyd there amonges hem, er that he furthere wente. thanne seide he that he wolde veramente Gon visiten the thre kynges, where so they be, and how they ferde, to knowen &amp; to se. Thanne Seyde Syre Vlphyn to Hym Anon: ‚Äúmerlyn, be war how that ?e gon, For they on the tothir syde don ?ow manace, ?if they mown geten ?ow jn ony place, that certeinly ?e scholen be ded, and they mown ?ow geten jn ony sted.‚Äù ‚Äú?e,‚Äù quod merlyne, ‚Äú?it wyl j not werne that to these kynges j wyl ful ?erne. For of Me geten they non power. And ek also amonges hem com j not ther, Tyl that j haue spoken with Arthewr the kyng; j ne schal maken non taryeng. and there-fore gouerne ?e wel this ost, that non man Jsswe, nethyr lest ne most. For kyng Artheures enemyes jlogged be here vndyr Bredygam, ful certeinle, and Fowrty thousend of hem ben told, wel horsed men, hardy and bold, and but xxv thousend men we haue; there-fore we moste loken to kepen hem saue, and of hem that non j-lost there be, To this mater vs behoueth to se.‚Äù ‚Äúmerlyne,‚Äù quod Syre Vlphin thanne, ‚Äúhit is bette ?e sende som other manne.‚Äù ‚Äúthat schal j not,‚Äù quod merlyne tho, ‚ÄúFor that arende my-self best kan do and hem to bringen jn Savete, that non of here enemyes hem schal se.‚Äù ‚Äúthanne goth ?e forth in goddis name, and he ?ow kepe from angyr &amp; blame.‚Äù thanne from hem he wente ful sodeynlye, that they ne wyste whanne, trewelye. so that they hem blesseden everichon, that so sodeinly he was from hem gon. A?en to the ost wenten they thanne, and there they charged every manne that owt of his tente they scholde not pase, but prevyly to kepen hem jn that plase. So that fowre dayes contenued this, &amp; √æat of √æe iij kynges non word they herden, jwys, Nethir of merlyn neuere the mo. For streyht to londone gan he go and, as this storye reporteth here, on the morwe er evensong was he there, where that he fond the kynges al thre. and they weren ful hevy, Sykyrle, For so sodeinly amongis hem comen he was, that they ne wysten owt of wheche plas. and whanne they wisten that hyt was he, gret joye they maden, ful certeinle. thanne axeden they hym how he hadde sped, and seyde: ‚Äúwel in every sted!‚Äù and bad hem, faste that they scholde hye To here ost, that hem Bod, trewelye. Thanne seide kyng Ban To merlyn: ‚Äúbien owre Socours comen wel &amp; fyn?‚Äù ‚Äúthat they ben, Syre, ful trewelye, and kyng Artheuris host ben logged faste bye jn the lawnde besydes Bredygam; there ben they logged every man. but on the tothyr syde moche peple there js, Ten kynges corowned, with-owten mys, and jn here compenye a dewk also, and xl thousend men they hauen &amp; mo.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor oure help now be god,‚Äù quod Antron, ‚ÄúFor mochel mischef toward vs gynneth gon.‚Äù ‚Äú?e,‚Äù quod merlyne to hym ryht thanne, ‚Äúas that j am now kyng Arthewris manne, and be the oth that j haue hym j-do and ek to my maister Blasye also: be goddis helpe, and that j kan don, To evel ende schal j hem bringen echon.

But the xj kynges that departed were, and jnto the pleyn feld weren fled for fere, they setten a busch on lyht Fere thenne, therby to hem to gaderen thanne. and so they deden, as they myhten gon, For of hem pyte Artheurs meyne hadde non, So that er they knewen the day lyht, thre part of here meyne weren slayn jn fyht. whanne they of the ost behelden al this, that a?ens hem was so mochel peple, j-wys, Eche man fledde to his Banere, where as √æe horn herde he sownen there.

Sire Lwcawns his hors there smot so sore, and with Gwycher √æe kyng mette he thore, So that thorwhe hawberk and haberiown Sone jnto the feld there smot hym down. thanne whanne Sire moret beheld tho this, Ful sone jn that Sadel he was, j-wys, and forth he prekede jnto that pres, and for non man ne wolde he ses. thanne Belyas &amp; Flawndryn say he there, that vppon tweyne of his Felawes rested were, vppon dryawnt and dynas, that with Artheur weren jn that plas. but so gret was there that pres with-jnne, er sire moret to his Felawes myhte wynne, So that so sore there gan he fyhte, that hit was merveyl to ony mannes syhte; and so wel there he hym bar jn that fyht, that his felawes he rescwede anon ryht. And al this mene whyle Artheur the kyng vppon the tothyr side ful sore was bekeryng, and anothir kyng √æere hym ageyn, So √æat gret noyse gan rysen, jn certeyn, on partye to reskwen √æere kyng Artheur, anothyr partye hym to werkyn Langowr. So that anon bataylle began there ful strong betwixen bothen partyes hem among, but evere bothe kynges on horsbak were. but kyng Arthewr they myhten don no dere, For Kyng Arthewr and His meyne tho to the partye thanne wrowhten ful wo; and streyht to rescwen he forth wente Sire Gyrfles and Sire kay, veramente, that with kyng Newtres &amp; with Brangores, with kyng Vryens &amp; with kyng Ydiers and ek the Fyfthe kyng abygawnt also‚Äî these fyve these knyhtes hadden don moch wo; hem hadden they so beten and vnhorsed bothe, that aschamed they weren &amp; of here lyves lothe. and these two knyhtes non o√æer Socour hadden there but goode Syre Lwcawns the Botelere. and there this sire Lwcawns so hym √æer bar, that there-offen wondrede kyng Arthewr thar, and beheld the grete nede that they weren jnne. thanne for non thyng ne wolde he blynne, but jnto that pres prekede as a wood lyown, and on bothe sides dyde he mochel distrocciown, that non man there dorste his strok abyde; So sore fawht kyng Arthewr jn that tyde. and on bothe his sydes he slowh down ryht, so hydous &amp; angry was he in fyht. and ek Sire kay and Sire Gyrfle? with Arthewr sore fowhten they in that pres. on the to√æer syde syre Antron, Vlphyn, &amp; sire Bretel a?ens dukes &amp; kynges fowhten wondyrly wel, wyche weren dewk escam and kyng Tradelyvand, and a?ens chybret, kyng of Northhumberland, and ek a?ens kyng karados also, that a worthy werrour was holden tho. and alle these a?ens kyng Artheur gonnen ryde, and there sore fowhten they in that tyde. For eche a?ens o√æer so sore justed there, that they to-borsten bothe Scheld &amp; spere. For ne hadde socour to kyng artheur sone √æere be, the wers hadde he had, ful certeynle. For tho kynges and knyhtes on √æe to√æer side, Ful worthy men they weren that tyde; ek dowble they hadden a?ens kyng Artheur, that vnnethe they myhten abyden that stowr. Thanne happede, kyng Ban and kyng Bors that owt of √æe forest comen with gret fors jn releveng of kyng Arthewr there; but √æe tothyr partye of hem not war were. Anon they gonnen hem askryen so Lowde, that hit dynede jnto the clowde. Ful fresch they comen owt of that forest as worthy kynges, to fyhten ful prest. Thanne behelden al this these o√æer barowns, and wisten wel that non distrocciowns myhte comen but thorwghe theke partye; wherfore to cownseille they gonne hem hye, and to-gederis assemblede jn a medewe √æere, al these Lordynges to-gederis Jn fere, and tooken cownseyl what they myhten do. thanne seide kyng Loth to hem ryht tho: ‚Äúj wot wel that ech of vs here fyhten muste, but to on thyng ?e mown wel troste: that j my-self a?ens fowre o√æer thre, be my josteng ouercomen scholen be. Forto avengen myn noysaunce on hem j thenke to don veniaunce. for mochel peple han we lost here, whiche that they scholen beyen ful dere.‚Äù And whanne the kyng of an .c. knyhtes herde kyng Loth thus Speken owtryhtes, gret preyseng to hym ?af he thanne, as belonged to swich a worthy manne, And Swor By His creawnce Anon Ryht that the same wolde he don jn Fyht. And kyng karados &amp; kyng Newtres also the same oth sworen they bothe two. And the dewk escam of kambenye the same oth there swor, Sekerlye, and ek kyng clarioun of Northhumberlond the same oth swor, as j vndirstond. ‚ÄúNow schal j seyen ?ow,‚Äù quod kyng Loth thanne, ‚Äúwhat we scholen don now every manne. sixe of owre feleschepe we scholen ordeygne a?ens ?one busschement, jn certeyne; and here scholen beleven othyr fyve a?ens this meyne to fyhten ful blyve. for xi kynges here we now be to fyhten a?ens al this meyne. So that a?ens this busschement welen we go with .x. thousend fyhtyng men and mo, and viij thousend scholen we leven here kyng Artheur to anoyen jn alle manere. and toward √æe forest welen we go; tyl a?ens the Nyht lete vs don so. and oure purpos thanne bettere scholen we have and therto owre meyne moche bettere Save. For ?if that we abyden here stylle, they ben ful lyk to werkyn vs ylle.‚Äù To this cownseyl of kyng loth √æere anon thussone concentyd they everychon. thanne assembled to-gederis they were, and here hol meyne departed there. So that kyng Loth took with hym the kyng of an hundred knyhtes so grym, augwysseaus, &amp; dewk escam of kambenye, with xij thousend men jn here partye, where-offen that vj wynges they hadde and jn eche wynge ij thousend they ladde. So that forth they reden an esy pas, tyl that they comen jnto √æe same plas that kyng Loth √æere ordeyned before, for better conseyl myht not han ben thore. thus the .vj. kyngges forth they wente, and .v. abyden thanne there presente Forto werren vppon Arthewr the kyng hym forto anoyen with sore fyhttyng. Now of the .v. that leften behynde j schal ?ow tellen, as cometh to mynde. kyng Brangores &amp; kyng Vryens, kyng Newtres, kyng clariouns, men of defens, whiche was kyng of Northhumberland, and of north wales kyng Tradelyvaund, alle these weren jn on compenye with vij thousend men, certeynlye, and drowh hem to-gederis jn busschement, as this storye here reporteth, verament. For lyk as goode bodyes as they were, Ful manfully defendid hem there. but ful gret harm and damage hit was of the gret werre, was jn that plas be-twene kyng Arthewr &amp; kyng Lothis meyne. that tyme began there ful strong melle, whiche that durede, tyl evensong was don, and many a man to deth there gan gon. vppon the tothyr partye entrede kyng Ban, and kyng Bors kam with hym than, With Leownces and Syre Faryens Also, that the ferste Bataylle ladden tho. So that they comen an ese pas, tyl they weren alle ensemblyd jn that plas, and a?ens hem kam kyng ydyers, as he was kyng ful stowt and fers. And whanne that to-gederis there they mette, many sore strokes to-gederis they sette, So that the noyse myhte wel han ben herd a long half myle; so sore they Ferd. Ful gret occisioun thanne there was bothe of men and hors jn that plas. but certeyn kyng Ydiers meyne that storm miht not suffren jn non degre, but fledden awey for discomfyture To kyng gwyseawns, j ?ow ensure, whiche sone hem comforted sothfastly. and a strong bataylle began √æere, trewely, So that Sire Faryens and his meyne at gret mischef weren, ful Sykyrle. and whanne leownces of Paerne be-held al this, Ful sone to reskews he rod, j-wys, and so sore rod vpon that meyne, that jn that place ne lefte he, Sykerle, Non that dorste hym there abyde; So socowred he Pharyens jn that tyde. and thus drof he forth that compenye Jnto the dewkis ost of kambenye. Whanne the dewk hem Sawh comen so, thanne jn his herte he was ful wo, and a?ens hem faste he gan to ryde that hem so chasede jn that Tyde. and thanne they that flowen to-fore, a?en with the dewk retorned thore, and there began ful strong Bataylle, whan that eche partye gan other assaylle. thanne thussone entrede kyng Bors there with his hol meyne al jn fere, and there so sore they meten jn same, that betwene tho partyes was non game. and whanne kyng ydyers kyng Bors beheld, that So kam prekynge jn the feld, thanne to his feleschepe there seide he anon: ‚Äúgod vs defende now everychon this day from the peryl of ded of hym that cometh here jn this sted! For hym j knowe be his armure, that he is knyht bothe good and sure. For neuere his place he wyle forsake For non dismembrure ne for non wrake. and √æerto he is so worthy a knyht, jn al this world non bettere jn fyht. for thowh al the world were hym ageyn, but his owne brothyr hit were, jn certeyn, of prowesse Js there non man that jn bataylle dar abyden hym than.‚Äù Anon the kyng of an hundred knyhtes thanne askede of kyng ydiers what was that manne. thanne answerede kyng loth to hym ageyn, &amp; seide hit was kyng Bors of Gawnes, jn certein. ‚Äúbut, certein, j ne wot how he here kam; and behold, with hym he ledeth many a man!‚Äù ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù quod the kyng of an hundred knyhtes tho, ‚Äúhow jnto this contre scholde he comen so?‚Äù ‚Äúj not, so me god helpe!‚Äù quod kyng loth thanne, ‚Äúbut this day behoveth now every manne to preven hym-self a worthy knyht a?ens this kyng Bors here in fyht.‚Äù Anon Answerede Kyng Karados thanne: ‚Äúj not, this day ho √æat kan preven hym a manne, nethyr this day what we scholen do; but j my-self a?ens hym now wile j go. and ?if ony mester that j haue of Socour, loke ?e not me Faylle for non langour.‚Äù therto they graunteden everychon; he took his leve, and forth gan to gon. thus kyng karados wente forth thanne and with hym jn compenye many a manne; an esy pas and sadly they wente, til that kyng Bors they metten presente. and whanne that so ny to-gederis they were, of an archer a bowe drawht there, bothe parties to-gederis mette so faste, that ech on othyr here speres gonne breste, so that on bothe partyes they fyllen a-down, and of karados meyne gret occisiown. thanne drowen they owt here swerdis blyve, and manye a man there loste his lyve. thanne kam kyng Bors to an old knyht, whiche man that Blaaryus hyht, and hym comanded his Baner to bere (and this knyht dorste not refusen it there), and bad hym gon forth hym be-fore, that the Bretowns his armes myhten sen thore. Thanne took he a Royde spere anon, and jnto that pres he gan faste to gon, and that Reng he to-barst ful sone, and √æere-jnne entrede amonges hem echone. and with a knyht he mette schortly there, that thorwh armes and harneys he gan him bere. So thorwh the body there he hym smot, that down he fyl thanne, god hit wot, and brak his Nekke jn his fallynge tho; Swich destenye that knyht cam vnto. thanne kyng Boors drowh owt his swerd, and amonges that meyne √æere so he ferd. and whanne the peple Say hym faren so, Ful faste to flyht thanne gonne they go. thus kyng karados loste his meyne; For kyng Bors they gonnen alle to fle. that beheld the kyng of an hundred knyhtes; to Socouren karados he kam ful Ryhtes with ij thousend knyhtes jn compenye, that bolde werriours weren and worthye. and there fulsone to-gederis they mette, and many harde strokes to-gederis smette. For there to speken of king Bors prowesse, how that he fawht there jn that presse! Also ek on the tothir kynges syde they fowhten ful strongly that ylke tyde, bothe kyng karados and the tothyr kyng, that of an hundred knyhtes hath gouernyng. [for] so strong was the Bataylle thanne, that at mischef there was many a manne. Thanne kyng Ban of Baynoyk entrede anon, and with his meyne he entrede ful son, and there his steward his armes bar with a crowne of gold and azure thar with two bendis travers, ?elw &amp; grene; As ony flowr o√æer herbe there was hit sene. and of this Sixe knyhtes jn swte hadde he, bothe hors and man al jn on degre; Bothe trappures and Testerys, Al that √æer Was, so was arrayed there jn that plas. and whanne these kynges syen this syht, wondirly they weren ful sore a-fryht, and seiden they mosten forsaken here place, For they knewen there non othir grace. thanne to hem assembled kyng Loth, Ful sore wepyng there, wel j wot, and seide there to his compenye: ‚ÄúNow wot j wel, ful Sekerlye, alle is lost that we hauen jdo.‚Äù So bothe partyes thanne metten they tho; So sere here lawnces they borsten on sondyr, that al the erthe qwaked hem vndyr; and out of helmes √æe fer owt flew, that many a man hit Sawh on rew; and with the strokis √æat weren hem betwynne, alle that forest hit denede with-jnne, that half a myle men myhten hit here, ho that jn that feld tho were. whanne that kyng Ban ful sembled was a?ens the tothere jn that plas, there nolde but fewe there thanne abyde. Anon vppon √æe fyve kynges gan he ryde and ek vppon here hole meyne; For √æere made kyng Ban gret mortalyte. For anon as they kyng Ban aspyde, Ful faste they fledden that jlke tyde For the grete occision that kyng Ban made abowtes hym jn virown; and gret martyrdom he made also, and thus jn eche reng √æere gan he go, bothe on lefte syde and ek on √æe ryhte; he kyd hym there as kyng and knyhte. So that j-dowted he was ful sore of alle his enemyes √æat weren thore. Thanne forth cometh kyng Loth tho and the kyng of an hundred knyhtes also, and Sire margamur here thridde felawe was, with here Bataylles jn that plas. For thussone the bataylles j-medlyd were on with-jnne ano√æer ryht sone there. and whanne that they behelden kyng Ban, that so gret damage dyde there than, kyng Loth there-with was angry tho, and ek the tothyr kyng was ful wo. with here spores smeten they here hors thanne, and bothe they reden a?ens kyng Banne, for kyng Loth was a worthy knyht, and that he kydde there in his fyht. For with his spere he smot so kyng Ban, that a cantel of his scheld jnto √æe feld flew than. and whanne that kyng Ban felte thys, Fulsore he was amevyd there, j-wys. Anon his goode swerd he lefte on hy, as a man that was bothe wroth and angry, and to the kyng of an hundred knyhtes he rod, and hym so smot, there that he stod, vppon the helm; but hit glaweede adown There vppon his horsis arsown, that Trapped was jn erne &amp; stel. but ?it that Strok hyt bot ful wel, For the hors chine asondir there he smot, that bothe to grownde wenten fot hot. And whanne this kyng of an .c. knyhtes Felte hym so feld there jn fyhtes And therto His Hors Vndyr Hym so Ded, thanne was he ryht of Sory red. Vpe sone he rekouerede forto stond, and his swerd took jn his hond, and leyde his Scheld vppon his hed, For fulsore he dowtede of ded. Whanne that kyng Brangores beheld al this, that √æe kyng of an hundred knyhtes, j-wys, was thus feld and leyd on grownde, anon to kyng ban he rod that stownde, and smot hym evene a-myddes the scheld, there as he hovede jn the Feld. and kyng Ban Sone there tornede ageyn, and vppon the helm he rawht hym, ful pleyn, that his coyphe of yrne and Sercle also evene asondyr smot he tho, that to the grownde he fyl down ryht, For lengere to sytten hadde he non myht. Aftyr, whanne these kynges rekouered were, a?ens kyng ban Sore Fowhten they there. but he dede hem mochel more grevaunce, thanne they hym deden, with-owten dowtaunce. For ?it nas there non of the kynges two but that mochel of here blood hadden lost tho. what be here hurtes &amp; woundes bothe Ful feynt to fyhten they were forsothe. but ?it mochel harm there was j-do betwixen thike thre kynges tho. and whanne the bataylle entre-mellid were, asondyr sone weren they departyd there, whethyr that eyther partye wolde o√æer non; but ?it amonges hem moche harm was don. Thanne hyt happede that ylke tyde, that kyng Artheur jnto that pres cam ryde, and fond kyng Ban fyhtyng on fote, wherfore he was ful wo, god wote. but evere he fawht So sore there, that non man ne dorste comen hym nere, and so forth wente thorwh the pres vigerously fyhtyng, with-owten les. but there wolde non man his strokes abyde, So merveyllous they weren jn that tyde. thanne entrede kyng Artheur on √æe to[thyr] partye thorwh al the pres ful manfullye with his swerd on honde, that Soyled hit was with hors blood &amp; mennes jn that plas. For manye merveylles wrowhte kyng Arthewr, For jn armes he was bothe Styf &amp; stowr. but whanne he Say kyng Ban at sweche myschef, hym thowhte hit was to hym gret repref. Anon kyn[g] Arthewr aspyde a knyht, that ryaly was arayed forto fyht. with his swerd to hym kyng Arthewr rod, and non lengere there he abod, but with his swerd smot hym so sore, that jnto the teth he clef his hed thore, that ded to the grounde he fyl anon. And kyng Arthewr be √æe reyne his hors took son, and to kyng Ban he ledde hyt ful faste. ‚Äúmy leve frend,‚Äù he seide, ‚Äúworth vp jn haste, For amonges ?oure enemyes ?e han j-be; this place to forsaken sone scholen ?e hem se.‚Äù Whanne that kyng Ban Recouered was Be helpe of kyng Arthewr jn that plas, Gret Joye Bothe to-gederys they made, and amonges here enemyes they prekeden ful glade. Anon as they on the tothyr partye kyng Artheur and king Ban dyden aspye, anon so discomfyt weren they tho of the harm √æat these two kynges hadden j-do, that they hadden j-lost clene here talent to fyhten or ony dede don, verament, but Towardis the wode they wente ful faste. And er they myhten hit keueren atte laste, mochel occisiown was don there be-twixen the wode and the revere there here Stale they rested &amp; kepte. Anon here meyne there to hem lepte, and jn peryl of deth echon, For vnnethis to hem askaped ony on. Whanne kyng Newtris and kyng loth tho and the kyng of an hundred knyhtes also, also kyng karados &amp; kyng ydyors, ek kyng Vryens &amp; kyng Brangors, that tho was kyng of Northhumberlond, To on partye they drowen, j vndirstond, Thanne seyde maganors to hem anon: ‚Äúwith ?oure meyne j rede that ?e hens gon For al hit is j-torned to scomfyture and to distroccion, j ?ow ensure.‚Äù Thus hem enchasede kyng Artheur tho, kyng Ban and kyng Bors also, tyl that they comen to on rever, that ful wondyrly depe was there; where as √æe fugytyves a brygge diden make there for to passe ouer that lake. So that they pasten ouer echon, and these thre kynges aftyr gonne gon. thanne merlyn Seyde to kyng Artheur tho: ‚ÄúSey me now, what thynkest √æou to do? thyn enemyes hast thou ouercomen echon, therfore jn-to thin owne contre thou gon, and with the thy frendes thou lede, be whom √æat √æou hast had ryht good spede, and hem do thou worschepe and honour, For they han holpen the jn many a stour.

Sethen he tolde hym ek also of the grete Bataylle √æat was j-do, and of the scomfyture of the xj kynges. So that this Blasye wrot alle these thinges, and jnto his Book √æere wrot he euery thing, Be whom now √æerof haven we knowleching. [B]ut of Al this Bataylle Leven We now talkyng, [an]d let vs Speken of anothyr thyng, [Ne]thir of Blasie ne of merlyne at this tyde [No] more to speken, but let vs forth glyde, [an]d to kyng Arthewr &amp; to the tweyne kynges also [tha]t jn his compenye gonnen forth to go, [and] ek of other baronage jn compenye, [tha]t with kyng Arthewr weren, Sekerlye.

For j-nowh they hadden of the Beste, bothe riche and powre, to gladen his geste. Thus they hem restede, tyl hit was day; And thanne kyng Arthewr comanded, jn fay, that al the good that geten was and ek al the rychesse Jnto on plas that to-gederis scholde ben browht, ful pleyn, For he wolde departyn hit √æere, jn certeyn. and whanne that they hadden herd here masse, they wenten there as al √æe trosor wasse. and there on hepis as that hit lay, These thre kynges, with-owten delay, departyd this good √æere to every man, as that hem thowhte he hadde nede than: on man lasse and a-nothyr more, as hem thowhte they weren worthy thore, and ek to many pore knyhtes also, ek to seriauntes that with hem weren tho; they ?ouen hem of √æat good ful largely, Whyles that Hem Last there ony peny. and sethen departyd they forth in here compenye bothe stedys and palfreyes ful justlye, clothes of gold &amp; of Sylk also, that nowht to departyn beleft hem tho. So that every man gwerdonen he was that with hem was jn that plas. thanne xl knyhtes chosen they tho with hem of Tarmelyde forto go, which meyne Sire Leownce &amp; sire pharyen jn governaunce hadden &amp; with hem sire Gracien. Thus this peple of Tarmelyde jnto here lond they gonne hem gyde, that kyng clawdas non harm scholde √æere do, whyles the two kynges here lond weren fro. Thanne these Barowns to-fore seid here, Jn here owne contres whanne they were, hem purchased bothe londes and fe, everych a man aftyr his degre, with the grete ?iftes that they hadde, and with √æe tresor √æat they out of √æe ost ladde, So that evere riche men they were, whiles that on erthe they lyvede here. So soiorned kyng Artheur at Bredygam stylle and with hym bothe kynges at his wylle (that was jn the march of gret Breteyne and ek of Tarmelyde tho, in certeyne) merlyne forto abyden there; this was Artheuris entent, j sey ?ow here. and vppon the morwen, whanne this was do, that kyng Arthewr his meyne hadde departyd so, and at Bredygam hadde mad gret feste as wel to √æe meste as to the leste, and whanne they hadden eten echon, out of here loggenges gonnen they gon Forto beholden bothe ryvere and mede, How √æat the flowres dyden springen &amp; sprede, thanne behelden they furthermore: they Syen where a old cherl cam thore ouer alle the medewes, the sothe to sayn, with his bowe on hande, jn certayn. and boltes vndir his gyrdel bar he, and wylde fowl hadde slayn, sekerle, the whiche vndir his gyrdel him heng abowte. ?it anothir bryd aspide he, with-owten dowte; anon his bowe to his ere he drowh, and anon ryht there that bryd he slowh. ?it wylde mathelardes he slowh also, and evere vnder his gyrdyl he dyde hem do.

So that kyng Arthewr vppon a day be merlynes leve, the Sothe to Say, he aqweynted hym with a mayden so ?yng; hym thowhte he sey neuere a fayrere thyng. hire name Lysanore y-clepyd hit was, therles dowhter Sevayn, that deyde be kas. that mayden homage cam forto do and with hyre Barowns manye mo anon aftyr the Scomfyture of the xj kynges, j ?ow ensure. thus for drede they comen to hym tho here londes to holden with-owten wo. For his bettere neuere j-seyn was; that thus for here londys they sowhten here gras. So that jt happede that this mayde, of whiche to-forn tyme j ?ow seyde, cam to the castel of Bredyngham, where that sche osteyed hyre than wit[h] a riche Burgeys, as j rehers, that was bothe riche, stowt, and fers. and anon as the kyng hadde cast his eye vppon that mayden, the sothe to seye, Thanne With merlyne Spak He Anon, that they to-gederis myhte speken alon.

This Loost dyde many a merveyllous thyng, as here-aftyr hit schal come to rehersyng. whanne that mydlentone was fully gon, kyng Arthewr of this damysele took leve anon. that so bothe kynges and ek he jn-to Tarmelyde wenten, certeynle. Now of hem resteth this Talkyng, and lete vs speken of a-nothyr thyng, and to the xj kynges retornen ageyn, whyder that they weren chased, jn certeyn. [Chapter XII] Now begynneth this Tale and telleth here of the xj kynges that conqwered were, how that they reden al that nyht Sorewenge &amp; wepyng, j ?ow plyht, For here grete los and here damage; thus ryden they Soreweng, bothe knyht &amp; page; Nethyr of al nyht rested of rydyng, which was to hem alle an hevy thyng. For nethir drynk ne mete was hem among, Nethyr of al day whiles √æe bataylle was strong, so √æat day &amp; thike nyht they weren meteles, and therto gret passing cold, with-owten les, therto strong frost and Ys there was; So weren they evel esed in eche a plas. thanne ryden they forth to a cyte ful hungry &amp; ful cold, as j telle the, whiche cyte Sorhant it hyhte, of kyng vryens, that was jn fyhte. So there they weren resceyved alle and wel j-esed, as tho myhte befalle. For there-offen they hadden ful gret mester, For many man was hurt and wondyd ther. and manye there deyden for noysaunce, For at thike tyme swiche was here chaunce. And Skars thre dayes there hadde they be, that hem comen tydynges, ful sykerle, owt of cornewaylle &amp; orkanye of gret distroccioun &amp; of √æe felonye that to here londes √æere weren j-do, and toforn √æe castel of Vandeberis Sege leyd also, And therto the peple is Fled A-Way, that neuere to-fore remevede, j dar wel say. and whanne these Barowns herden of this, alle here flesch gonnen to tremble, j-wys, For that so sodeyn an aventure To hem scholde comen jn that langure. thanne wisten they, with-owten dowte, that they weren distroyed al abowte, and Gonnen thanne to wepen ryht sore, alle the peple that was thore. So thanne hit happede vppon a day that kyng Brangores this myschef say. So that he sente messengeris faste To alle the kynges ostes jn haste, and that to hym they scholde comen anon jn alle the haste that myhte be don. So that thyder assembled many men jnto the halle of kyng vryen. and aftyr that they hadden herd √æis kyng speke, alle jnto on partye they gonnen forto reke with eyen rede and al for-wept, that longe waked hadden &amp; lytel slept. and amonges hem spoken they word non, but stodyn ful stylle there everychon. and whanne that kyng claryowns say this, that there non man wolde Speken, j-wys, anon vppon his fet he was there stondyng, and seide openly to Brangore the kyng: ‚ÄúSyre, hyder am j comen now to the to weten what thow wylt Seyn to me. Now telle me, Sire, what js thy wylle, &amp; to my power j schal hit fulfylle.‚Äù thanne seide sone kyng Brangores ageyn: ‚Äúj schal ?ow schewen, sire, jn wordis pleyn the cause why that j for ?ow sente; j schal ?ow tellen, Sire, veramente. Lordynges, hit is not to ?ow vnknowe that the kynrede of kyng Augwys this throwe jnto oure londes entred they ben, and there don they bothe brennen &amp; slen. ek to to the castel vandeleris jn cornwaylle they han leyd sege there, with-owten faylle. and therfore cownseyl we mosten take From that Sege to gon hem make, ek hem forto dryven owt of kontre, other elles alle distroye[d] we be, and alle oure eyres j-put to nowht, that jnto this world we han forth browht.‚Äù ‚Äú?e, Sire, wyle ?e vndirstonden now me: a?ens kyng Artheur we han now j-be and non thing encresyd jn his Lond; this owten ?e wel forto vndyrstond.

For the jeantes wolden held his lond al of hem, as j now vndirstond, and he defendyth hym as a man, as long as that he may &amp; kan. Nethyr of Perdenyan the kyng mowen ?e hauen non helpyng, nethyr of the kyng Amadonan, nethir of kyng clamades, j telle ?ou kan; For they werren vppon kyng galaost, the wheche is cosyn, wel thou wost, To the kyng of an hundred knyhtes; and a?ens hym they kepen here fyhtes.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut assone as kyng Galaost hath conqweryd the tothyr ost the wheche he halt werre ageyn, thanne wot j ful wel, jn certeyn, that non thing so sore doth he crave as √æat was vterpendragons Lond to have.

Thus Sone Vpe Ros Kyng Tradelyvaunt, that of northwales was kyng tho; to thike assemblyng spak he vnto: ‚Äúthe beste cownceille that j now can, that we now vs ordeyne every man vppon that contre to setten keping, there as the hethene hauen here entring, and that with al oure chevalrye Faste thedirward now let vs hye, and stoppen hem of here vytaylle, and of here socour ek to Faylle. &amp; jn that tyme mowen we than gaderen to vs many a man.

So that they repentyd al jn fere that evere with merlyn angry they were; but alto late hit was tho hem to repente: he was a-go. So that they acorded alle jn fere alle the marches to don kepen there. Thanne sente they forth be eche partye to kepen the marches, ful sekerlye, bothe olde &amp; ?onge that myhte gon &amp; of straunge Sowdiours manion.

The fyrste cyte that they dyde kepen tho was toward Cornewaille, with-owten mo, whiche that thike tyme Nawtes hyghte, there as the hethene gonnen alyghte. Thyder gan gon kyng Ydyers with a meyne bothe prowd &amp; fers, that beleften of his Bataylle, as j ?ow seye with-owten faylle. and whanne kyng ydyers cam to √æat cyte, Ful glad and blithe gonnen they to be. For every day affrayed they were of tho hethen that weren comen there, that everyday there, certeinle, they wenten abowte that cyte and distroyed alle jn virowne abowte the contre there, with-owten dowte. For of hem Sevene thousend there be jn this partie aryved, ful sekerle. so that there dar non man passen therby with-owten gret strengthe, Sekerly.

For with-owten comfort &amp; socour they were a?ens the hethene that aryveden there. for they distroyeden al that contre bothe of corn and of bestes, ful certeinle. but whanne kyng Newtris entryd that cyte that jn cornwaille stood, ful pleynerle, he it wel gouernede with al his myht, lyk as he was bothe worthy kyng and knyht. and alle the strengthes that belonged √æerto, Ful manfully he let Stuffen hem tho, and sente aftyr sowdeours jnto eche contre, Tyl Sevene thousend he hadde in semble what on hors and what on foote (So manye he hadde, wel j wote) with-owten tho that weren jn towne that day, Fyve thousend men sensable, j dar we[l] say. thanne so wel kepten they that contre, that non of the hethene, ful Sykerle, but lytel refresschyng cowden they wynne, and euere among was bataille hem betwynne. So that the hethen be aventure losten gret peple, j ?ow ensure. for kyng Newtris was a worthy knyht, and a sone he hadde of ryht gret myht be his wyf, that Soster was sche To kyng Artheur jn alle degre. this ?ong child was xvj ?er of age, ful of bewte and of gret corage. his modir qwene Blasine hyghte, Qwene Ygwernes dowghter, j sey ?ow ryhte, that vterpendragon hadde to wyve, aforn dewk Tyndagellis wif be his lyve, whiche dewk this blasine on Ygwerne be-gat, er that he deyde, j wot wel that. Vppon this same qwene Blasine thanne begat kyng newtris this worthy manne. For as here reherseth this storye, a knyht of √æe rownd table he was, sekerlye. his name was that tyme jn presence Sire Galachim, that tyme dewk of clarence. So whanne this galachim gan to vndirstonde that Swich a werre there was jn londe, how his fadir kyng Newtris with Arthour gan werre, To his modyr he wente, &amp; sowhte not ferre, and seide: ‚Äúdere modir, j preie now the, The trewthe of on thing telle thou me: were ?e not dewk hoelis dowhter of tyndagel and of Ygwerne j-born, that men knewen ful wel? wheche after wedded kyng vterpendragon, on whom he gat kyng Artheur, man of renown, the wheche myn vncle sothly he js and therto a worthy kyng of pris, that xj kynges scomfyted in bataylle with ryht fewe peple, with-owten faylle. and therfore, my modir, j charge now the of this the sothe that ?e tellen me.

Whanne that galachim gan vndirstonde the dedis of √æat worthy kyng jn londe, anon he besowhte god, certeynlye, that jn this world he scholde neuere dye, Tyl that kyng had mad hym knyht, that holden was so worthy jn fyht. ‚Äúand ?if onis with my swerd gyrde he me, al my lyve after, ful certeinle, with hym to dwelle, to lyven &amp; to deye, j sey ?ow, modir, be my feye!‚Äù thus from his modir departed he thanne as an hevy &amp; a pensyvous manne, and him be-thouhte thanne everich owr how he myhte comen to kyng Arthewr. Anon a messenger dide he sende after gawnenet, his cosin so hende, that was kyng lothis Sone, that to hym to brokelond scholde he come also prevyly as he evere he myhte; the day was set of metyng ryhte. and with this the messenger wente his way To his cosin gawnenet, √æe sothe to say. Now lefe we here of this storye, and to speken of √æe kynges now let vs hye that at Sorhant to-gederis dwelle, and how that of aventuris they don telle. Now aftyr cometh hit Jnto memorye hou from Sorhant departyd kyng loth, sekerlye, and wente forth streyht To Garle cyte with ful thre thousend of his meyne, that weren holden worthy knyhtes &amp; goode, whiche with him out of √æe bataille ?oode. &amp; whanne he was comen to that cyte, the cete?eins maden joye and solempnite; for the hethen diden hem ful gret anoye, and al that contre they deden distroye what with robberye and brennenge; that contre they wasted jn alle thinge. Anon as kyng loth knew of this, For sowdeours he sente, with-owten mys, Faste abowtes jnto eche contre to geten as manye as √æanne myhte he. and er a mounthe was fully past, ten thousend sowdeours he hadde jn hast with-owten hem of that cyte, weren foure thousend, certeinle, To kepen that cyte bothe day &amp; nyht, whiles √æat kyng loth rod owt to fyht. So that often-tymes he with hem mette, and to-gederis many strokes they sette. So that his pore bachelerye gat often gret goodis, sekerlye. and al that evere they myhte wynne, kyng loth hit parded there hem betwynne. and that causede that gret meyne To kyng loth repeirede, certeinle, For bencheson of his gentilnesse &amp; fre, Sprang so wyde jnto eche contre; Thre thousend comen to hym anon ryht, For that he was holden so fre a knyht. and faire children he hadde be his wyve; worthiere bodyes weren non on lyve. Soth hit is that kyng lothis wyf was kyng Artheuris soster, with-owten stryf, ryht evene fully jn the same degre as was kyng Newtris wyfe, Sekerle. this lady bar be hire lord, Loth the kyng, fowre worthy childeren, with-owten lesing: Gawnenet, Agravains, &amp; sire Garrers, Gaheryes, foure knyhtes bothe goode &amp; fers. on the tothyr syde was Sire mordret hire eldest sone, with-owten let, whiche that on hire be Artheur engendrid was, and wyle ?e now heren be a wondyr cas. For j thenke to tellen ?ow every del how he was begeten on hire ful snel, So thanne the bettere may this storye ben more alowed, ful Sekerlye. For mani men knowen not how √æat it was of his be-geteng, ne nowht the cas. therfore they preisen it moche the lasse, For they ben vnknoweng of day &amp; plase. hyt behappede, as j ?ow schal say, that the barons alle vppon a day of √æe rewm of logres assembled were at kerdyf jn wales, with-owten dwere, there forto chesen hem a newe kyng aftyr vter pendragoun, with-owten lesyng. so that kyng loth with hym gan lede with hym his wyf jnto that stede; and so dyden o√æer barons also, that here wyves dyde with hem go. So that kyng loth j-logged he was and alle his meyne jn a ful fair plas, jn wheche place Antron jlogged was he and with hym Sire kay, ful certeinle. and artheur ful previly jlogged he was jn √æe kyngges chombre, so fil the cas. And Whanne Kyng Loth to mete Was Set, aftir Antron he sente, with-owten let, and also anon aftyr Sire kay, that but a ?ong knyht was that day. So √æat kyng loth ordeyned there that Antron &amp; Sire kay j-logged were jn his owne chambre ful prevyly; and ?ong Artheur was logged faste by at thentre of the chambre jn a korner, as befyl that tyme for a worthy sqwyer. this Artheur was a faire ?ong man, and mochel of norture that tyme he kan. and that lady he was fayn to plese &amp; ek to kyng loth to don him ese. This lady was both fayr &amp; ?yng and a good womman ouer alle thing, whom that Artheur lovede prevyly. but sche ne rowhte sche wiste not, sikerly, for stedfast sche was to hire Lord and him to plese at his owne acord. So hit behappede, as J ?ow say, that al the Baronage hadde taken a day at the Blake cros to meten jn fere there forto touchen of here matere. So on the nyht before hit happede tho, that kyng loth scholde thider go, he charged prevyly his meyne that hors &amp; harneis redy scholde be at midnyht with him forto gon; thus prevyly he charged hem everichon. So that his meyne, verament, Fulfild jn haste his comaundement vnknowen the lady of alle this thing. ful prevyly from hire wente he stalkyng, and jn hire bed lefte hire stylle on slepe, for of his goynge took sche non kepe. and Artheur, that wel knew of al this, that jn that corner √æere lay, j-wys, took good kepe of the kynges goynge, and ful prevyly to here bed wente he stalkynge, and there he turnede hym bothe to &amp; fro, but ?it this lady on slepe was tho. So as hit happede this kas gan gon, this lady awok &amp; hire tornede anon, and him enbraced al jn hire Slepe, that of non othir took sche non kepe but of hire owne lord so dere, weneng to hire to ben hire fere. and whanne that Arthewr felte this, thanne wiste he wel, with-owten mys, that of hym sche took non kepe but as a womman that was jn slepe. So that he embraced hire ageyn, and so be hire he lay, jn certeyn, where-offen the lady ful joyful was; sche wende hire Lord hadde ben jn √æat plas. and that Nyht, in certein to say, was mordret begeten, with-owten delay, jn this maner as ?e now here. And whanne that Artheur his wil hadde there, he ne slepte non maner thing, tyl that lady was fallen jn Slombring; thanne stalkyd Artheur previliche a-away. For √æer-of ne wyste non, the sothe to say, tyl on the morwe, as hit gan falle, that hym-self hit tolde jn the halle, whanne sche was set at hire denere, and Artheur as hire kervere knelede there. So that hit happede tho, this lady gent of his long knelyng took good entent. ‚Äúleve sevs,‚Äù sche seide, ‚Äú?ong Bacheler, Ful longe [mow] ?ow thinken that ?e knelen her.‚Äù And He Answerede Ful Boldlich Ageyn: ‚Äúto longe may j not knelen, certeyn, For j ne may not deserven the grete bownte, myn owne lady, that ?e han don for me.‚Äù thanne axede this lady anon ryht: ‚Äúwhat bowntes ben tho, gentyl wyht?‚Äù thanne seide Artheur, certeinle, that for him discouered scholde hit neuere be, ne non thyng to hire he wolde discrye, but ?if of trowthe sche wolde hym affye that neuer sche scholde discouere it to non creature, and also anothir thing sche schold hym Sure: that harm to his body scholde sche neuere do, ne be hire to ben purchased nether to ne fro. And sche hire trowthe ensured hym ful son as womman of that mater took kepe non. thanne anon Arthewr gan hire to telle prevyly betwixen hem how hit be-felle, and jn what maner that he be hire lay; al he hire tolde thike same day. Anon this lady gan wexen red, that for pure schame sche was ny ded; but non wyht wiste of here covyne. for at that tyme wolde sche no more dyne but let tables ben drawen, verament, and ful faste to hire chombre sche went. lo, thus ?onge Artheur be his soster lay, that kyng Lothis wif was that day; but hit behappede neuere aftyr more. and thus was mordret of hire body bore, For sche knew wel be tyme &amp; space that be Arthewr with childe sche was. Whanne that the tydynges gonnen forto springe that this ?onge Artheur scholde be kynge, and this mordret was tho j-bore, thanne jn herte louede sche him wel more thanne ony man cowde tellen that day, but for hire lord sche dorste nowht say. and mochel sorwe sche hadde jn herte for that werre, that was so smerte, and jn that rewm so many a schowr betwixen hire lord and kyng Arthowr and betwixen o√æer peple also that in theke rewm weren tho. So that hit happed vppon a day, that ?onge Gaweyn scholde hym go play, and qweyntely was he arayed there jn manere of a ?ong sqwyere that on huntyng scholde fare to chasen bothe the hert &amp; hare with two les of grehoundis jn √æat place, &amp; besides him stood there ?it two brace. he was the fairest schapen man that jn his tyme ony knew than; but this storye not declareth here Sauf of on thing in this manere: that he hadde certein tymes of √æe day; what that they weren j schal ?ow say. whanne that he ros on morwen vpryht, jn the world ne was there a strengere knyht; and at the owr of pryme, with-owten delay, his strenkthe hit doublede every day; and at the our of Tiers hit doublede eft sone, and eft-sones hit dowbled at the None; and so alle the oures of the nyht with him it abod jnto day lyht; So that every morwenyng thus ferde gawayn, with-outen lesyng. Whanne gaweyn entrede the chambre there, as ?e hauen herd rehersed here, His modyr Lay be on chemene, and there-jn fyr ful gret plente, as a womman that ful pensif was For hire brothyr jn that plas, and for the werre, was hem be-twene; thus lay that lady &amp; morned be-dene; and for schedyng of blood ful gret plente, that was amonges the cristiente, and for the hethen that entred were jnto that Lond amonges hem there. Whanne that lady Gaweyn beheld, that tyme it were to beren armes &amp; scheld, Sche began to wepen riht sore. Anon Sire gaweyn axede hire wherfore. ‚Äúcertes, sone, j haue now gret Skyl, For ?e ?oure tyme ne don but spyl and ek ?oure bretherin, jn certeyn, ?e don but spillen ?oure tyme jn veyn, that worthy knyhtes myhten be jn kyng Artheurs cowrt, ful certeinle. For ?oure vncle he is be ryht, and jn this world not a bettere knyht. with him J wolde ?e weren jn plase pes betwyxen ?oure fadir &amp; him to purchase. for hit is ful gret pyte that be-twixen hem swich distaunce schold be and of othir barouns jn the Rewm, that of here kyng wylen taken non ?em. and god knoweth the Ryhtwysnesse, that hath hem browht in gret distresse; For mochel more han they lost thanne wonne. &amp; now this hethen on vs han begonne, that scholen distroyen vs everychon, ?if goddis help ne come not Son. and of hym helpe geten we non that scholde vs fende from oure fon, which is ?oure oncle kyng Artheur, that scholde vs helpe jn every stour. worschepe &amp; los scholde ?e purchase and pes to maken jn every plase, and namly that ?oure fadir &amp; he goode frendis that they myhten be. and non other good ?e don this tyde but eche day on huntyng forto ryde To chasen the hare in eche contre, and thus ?oure tyme lesen ?e; wherfore ?e ben alle to blame, that myhten becomen men of better fame.‚Äù Thanne to his modyr spak ?onge Gaweyn wordis that to hire weren ful pleyn: ‚Äútelle ?e this for trewthe to me, that Arthour be ryht kyng scholde be, and √æat ?oure brothir he is also, &amp; ek ?e seyn oure vncle √æerto?‚Äù ‚Äú?e, sones, with-owten drede, he is ?oure vncle, so god me spede‚Äù‚Äî &amp; sette on &amp; tolde hem al on ende holyche hou that mater gan wende. And whanne that gaweyn herde al this, anon to his modir he seide, j-wys: ‚Äúbe √æe trowthe j owe to God &amp; ?ow, of on thing j schal maken avow: that swerd ne armvre to beren jn fyht, tyl that kyng Artheur haue mad me knyht. and we to his cowrt scholen gon him forto helpen a?ens his fon, ?yf ?e welen helpen vs owht √æerto; bothe my bretheren scholen √æedir go of hym forto ben dubbid knyhtes &amp; after to helpen him jn his fyhtes A?ens Hem Alle that Hym Wrong Wylen Don; we scholen him gon helpen everichon.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, swete children, as towching me, neuere distorbeled scholde ?e be.

For here non thing ne mown we wynne; therfore lete vs faste hens twynne, rathere than here to lesen oure renown and with the hethen ben taken &amp; leid in presown and so to lesen bothe oure tyme &amp; age; this is non of the sevene sage.‚Äù Whanne gaweyn herde his brothir so sayn, thanne was he jn herte ful fayn, and was ryht joyful of his talkyng, whiche him plesede ouer alle thing. ‚ÄúNow lakketh vs nowht at this Tyde but oure aray wherwith to ryde; and therfore with-jnne these xiiij dayes, modyr, ?e helpen here now to arayen vs.‚Äù whanne that here modyr vndirstod this, a ioyful womman sche was, j-wys, and thanked god ful many a Sithe. ‚ÄúFor ?ow to arayen j schal hyen me blyve, For hors ne harneys scholen ?e non lakke, nethir that be-houith to ?oure bakke.‚Äù thanne weren the children glad jnowh and also merye as bryd on bowh. Now of this leve now we oure talkyng, and let vs forth speken of the kyng, that out of sorham cite ryt ful hevyly bencheson of the hethene √æat ben him by. Now forthermore let vs tellen son how that these iij kynges ben agon owt Of Sorham, that cyte there, jnto othir contres, with-owten dwere. thanne rod owt kyng clarioun, j vndirstonde, that was kyng of Northhumberlonde, and rod him to on fair cite, that berland hyhte, certeinle; whiche cite he kepte wondir wel with iij thousend men bothe goode &amp; lel with-owten hem that jn the town were, of whiche fyve hundred fond he there. So that tho marches he kepte ful strong, and euere with the hethene he fawht among, and often he wan &amp; often he loste, as hit behappeth jn every oste. thus this kyng anoyed hem sore, for jn that contre vitaille no more mihten they geten to here refressching; So hit hadde vpe gadered clarioun the kyng. So that after kyng Clarioun was gon, the kyng of c. knyhtes isswede anon owt of sorham cite, ful Sekerly, with iij thousend men of armes him by. to the cyte of malehant gan he ryde, √æere a gentyl lady hym abod that tyde; this cite marched vppon his lond. and for the hethene, j vndirstond, abowtes faste by they lye, that was √æe cause √æedir gan he hye. and the barouns hym preiden echon vppon the hethen with hem to gon. this kyng, that was so worthy a man, fulfilled the barouns wille than. (this kyng evere kept an c knyhtes, wherby he hadde his name be ryhtes; but his name was be his baptesm Aingnignes clept aftir his borntempe.) that [tho] marches kepte he wel al abowte, So that of √æe hethen they hadden litel dowte. Aftyr him past owt Tradelivaunt the kyng owt of that cyte, with-owten lesyng. and to northwales he took the way, to on of his cites, as j ?ow say. with iij thousend of armed men jnto his contre rod he then. and of his comeng they weren ful glad, for of the hethen gret drede they had, that dyden ful gret distroccioun al the contre abowtes jn virown. thanne sente this kyng anon riht there aftyr sowdiours every where, So that vij thousend men he hadde with hem that he ferst forth ladde what on hors &amp; what on fote; this was his somme, wel j wote, with-outen hem of √æe town, pleinly, √æat weren iiij thousend, sekerly, Wheche Hem Defendyd Jn Every tyde a?ens a chastel there beside. that a maiden that carville hyhte, Socoured the hethen with alle hire myhte; hadagabrantis soster, certein, was sche, that thike castel hadde jn baylle. And be tho marches, j sey ?ow ryhte, non of the kynges there ne myhte, for non power that they myhten do, non noysaunce the hethen don vnto. for bothe viaunde &amp; vytaylle √æe hethen hadde out of √æe castel ech day to hem ladde. for that castel so strong hit was tho, that non harm myhte comen hit vnto. (For this carville cowde more of enchantement than ony o√æer womman, verament, except morgain, that Sostir was To kyng Artheur, jn everi plas, o√æer ellis juanne, the love of merlyn, that of enchantement coude wel &amp; fyn; For sche knew more of merlynes konnyng thanne alle √æe creatures that weren levyng, as ?e scholen heren jn tyme comeng, whanne ?e me heren speke of swich a thing.) what so √æorwh helpe of that castel the hethen ben refresschid wel, wherfore cast out of londe mow they not be but be helpe of kyng Arthour, Sykerle, and be the helpe ek of kyng Ban, that is holden so worthi a man, also kyng Bors jn here compenye (√æe sonere out of √æis lond scholen they hye), and be helpe of o√æer mo: kyng Lothis children with hem scholen go, as here-afte[r] ?e scholen heren say jn storye j rad this jlke same day. Than owt of sorhant wente kyng Brangor with iij thousend men j-armed thor, and to strangore cite he rod ful faste; For next to the roche hit was ful preste, there as the hethene j-logged were. and aftyr sowdiours he sent every where, tyl that assemblyd he hadde the ryht vj thousend armed &amp; redy to fyht with-owten iij thousend he with him browhte, that forto werren on the hethen ne dredden they nowht. this kyng brangores hadde a wif, kyng Andoannes dowhter, with-outen strif, that of costantyn-noble was emperovr and therto a man of ful gret honour. and be his wif, that ded was, tweyne dowhtres he hadde jn that plas, of whiche kyng Brangor weddid √æe tone, and √æe tothir at costantyn beleft alone, that weddid was to the kyng of hungrye, as j sey ?ow certeinlye. So that at thende of fyve ?er, j wen, a knave child hadden they hem be-twen of the fairest forme that myhte be, that becam bothe worthi &amp; strong, sikerle. at whiche tyme whanne kyng brangor out of Sorhant paste thor, thike child of age that tyme was a knyht to ben mad jn ony plas. and he was clepid be his ryht name ?onge sagremour, that child of fame, whiche that after dyde gret prowesse, as the lond of logres bereth witnesse, as aftir jn this storye here scholen ?e fynde, whanne aftyr to this mater j come be kynde. The Renown that Sprang Abrod so Wyde of kyng Artheur jn every syde and of his largenesse &amp; of his gentrie, alle the world hit spak Of, trewelye. so √æat jn alle stronge contres, with-owten lesynge, was non speche but of Artheur the kynge. For his los tho sprange so wyde, that jnto costantynnoble hit cam that tyde; that so ferforth hit cam to ere, so ?onge sagremour herde √æerof there. that nas ?it but fyftene ?er old, a fair ?ong Bacheler and a bold. and whanne that he herde this tydyng, he ne wolde not letten for non thing, tyl he were mad knyht of his hond, the sothe j do ?ow to vndirstond. and often to his counseil seide he that a worthy man moste he nedis be‚Äî ‚Äúwhanne that myn ayel, adrians the kyng, of him knyht was mad, with-owten lesing.‚Äù For that he was √æe nexte eyr that to theke empire scholde repeyr. so that Sagremour swor, certein, that knyht scholde he neuere be, pleyn, tyl that kyng Artheur of Breteygne hym knyht hadde mad, jn certeygne. So that they spoken √æer-offen so ofte, that thike noise wax hye on lofte. So that Adrians gan him to hye Sagremours to sende forth, Sekerlye, jn-to breteyne with gold &amp; fe and what thing that to him belonged on lond &amp; se. now speke we no more ?it of this matere, but here-after more scholen ?e here. ?yt procedith forth this storye: whanne kyng brangores was past trewlye, owt of Sorhant thike cyte, kyng karados aftir wente, sikerle with his meyne arayed ful ryht, foure thousend men redy to fyht. and to strangore cite he wente ful faste (alle his men of armes with him paste) whiche cite he kepte ful wel as a wys worthy werreour &amp; a lel. ?it sente he abowtes wilde where aftyr mo Sowdyowrs to han hem there, so that atte laste assembled there was vij thousend men jn that plas wel j-armed with swerd and lawnce, of stedis &amp; coursers √æat cowden wel praunce. ?it at that tyme non hethen there were, wherfore eche nyht they lyen owt there jn feldes and jn weyes bothe to aspien whanne √æe hethen comen, forsothe and anon as that they myhten aspye that ony of the hethen drow ther nye, a?ens hem faste the wolden ryde and with hem fyhten jn that tyde. So that often they wonnen gret good, Whanne that the hethen hem withstood. Aftyr that these vj Kynges Weren gon Out of Sorhant cite everychon, thanne of Scotlond Agwyseax the kyng out forth he paste, with-owten lesyng, The richest kyng of that contre; but as of armes onnethis cowde he. this kyng out forth rod with v thousend men, and to √æe cyte of corange wente he then, whiche that jn scotlond tho Stood, where as manye of the hethene abod. For there nas but xx scottysch myle where as the hethen lyen thyke whyle at the castel of Vaundebers, where as the sege was strong &amp; fers, that non man of hem the nombre cowden telle of the hethen, that weren so felle. whanne this kyng jnto corange j-entred was, of the cete?eins fond he jn that plas Fyve thousend redy armed to fyht. ?it sente he forth bothe day &amp; nyht to seken soudeours be every syde; So that him comen with-jnne a tyde what on hors &amp; what on foote x thousend Saudiours, wel j wote, with-owten alle his owne meyne and ek the peple of that cyte. so with the hethen helden they bataille, &amp; often goodes wonnen, with-owten faille, and repareilled the walles of here cyte, √æere as it was most wont feble to be. thus longe durede √æe werre tho be-twene thike partyes bothe to. Thanne aftir this out of Sorhant wente dewk escam of kambenye, veramente, with iiij thousend j-armed ful wel what on hors &amp; on foote echedel. And forth he rod bothe day &amp; nyht, tyl to Cambenie cite he cam ful ryht, the whiche of richesse hadde gret plente and √æer-jnne thre thousend men, Sikerle. and whanne they syen √æe dewk cambenye, gret joye they maden, certeinlye, For √æe deseisse they hadde there of the hethen, that weren hem nere, that comeng weren to on castel, For whiche kyng Artheur ordeyned ful wel, er that he paste ouer the se jnto tarmelyde lond, Sikerle. ?it sente that dewk al abowte to geten more peple to his rowte; So that vij thousend he hadde redy, as this storie witnessith apertly, with-owten hem √æat weren jn that cite, which √æat kepe weren ordeyned, Sykerle. and with the hethen fowhten they ofte, for mochel Sorwe was √æere on lofte. ?it whanne these barouns out of sorhant were gon, thanne lefte kyng Vryens behinde hem echon, and sent his gold jnto eche contre aftyr sowdiours ful gret plente; so that viij thousend to him comen ful ryht, and jn the cyte viij thousend redy to fyht. For a sege there lay hem faste by but on jorne thennes, Sekerly; so that often they metten jn same al on ernest &amp; not on game. som tyme they wonne &amp; losten also, as the aventure torned bothe to &amp; fro. so that v ?er, whilles hit dede endure, was gret meschef, j ?ow ensure, That othir levyng was not jn that contre But as ech of other Hyt tok, Sykerle, the cristene of the hethene som on day, &amp; the hethen of cristene anothir, jn fay. thus was distroyed that contre, that pyte &amp; rewthe hit was to se.

And whanne here speris to-broken were, eche man to his swerd took there. So ech with-jnne o√æer gan to ryde, So that gret bataylle was √æat tyde. bothe of hors &amp; ek of men ful strong bloodsched was √æere then, that it ran down be eche vale, as here reherseth this ylke tale; √æerto √æe dost so gret hit was, onnethis ony o√æer knew jn √æat plas. Ful strong was √æanne that melle of the children and [hem] of Londone, as ?e mown se, a?ens tho cursed hethen wyhtes, that so longe endured jn fyhtes. From morwen jnto evensong belle, so longe they fowhten, as j ?ow telle. There dede gaweyn worthy prowesse amonges the hethene jn that presse, thanne mette with kyng mandelent; with him to fyhte hadde he good entent. For he hadde smyten on of his kyn, √æerfore he thowhte to meten with hym. Doon of kerdyf was his name; a man he was of ful good fame. to √æe erthe he hadde him browht, whiche √æat gaweyn ful sone him sowht. he wolde han smeten of his hed, but ano√æer thowht gawayn jn √æat sted. Atte laste ?it gaweyn with mandelent mette, &amp; on strok he on him sette; thorwh his helm Ran gaweyns dynt, and at his teth √æere hit stynt, &amp; he fil ded doun to √æe grownde; thanne sory weren √æe hethen √æat stonde. Whanne the Hethene Behelden tho that kyng mandelent was ded so, Ful sore abassched alle they were, So √æat echon they fledden there, and to Vandobers they gonne hem hye, where as the Sege was, Sekerlye. thanne began the chas ful strong and ek gret dowst, √æat ros hem among, that non man o√æer myhte knowe, not √æe fadyr the Sone jn that rowe. So that Sore was that Bataylle, that jn thyke chas weren slayn, sauns faille, what be gaweyn &amp; his Felawis there and with helpe of hem of londone jn fere‚Äî xij thousend weren Slayn vpryht, that onnethe of √æat meyne askapen ne myht not thre thousend of al that rowte; So they were chased bothe jnne &amp; owte. thus the hethene weren scomfyt echon, &amp; homward ful joyful √æe children gonne gon To the cyte of londone ful rapelye; these children ful faste gonne hem hye. with presoners and pray faste √æedir they ronne, with the goodis √æat tofore tyme √æe hethene hadden wonne. Whanne that these children to Londone weren went, gret joye the cete?eins maden, verament, and to-forn hem they Browhten anon alle the prayes that they hadden don. thanne to gawayn seiden they there, jn maner as chef lord that he were, that he scholde maken distribucioun of this good there al Jn vyrown. Thanne answerede Sire gaweyn anon that for non thing he nolde hit don. ‚Äúbut let Sire doon of kerdyf cyte departen hit as that he wyl for me. For he knoweth bothe Poure &amp; riche and aftir eche degre to departyn aliche. √æerfore at his wille hit Schal be do, For of hit j wele entermete no mo.‚Äù and whanne the cete?eines herden this, Ful mochel gaweyn they preiseden, j-wys, and hym they lovedyn with stedfast herte, For he was gentyl, debonewre, meek, &amp; aperte. thus jn londone restede that meyne with mirthe, Joye, and Solempnite. Now a whille reste we of this matere, and of kyng Artheur let vs speken here, of kyng Bors, and of kyng Ban, that thike tyme weren ful worthi men, and also of here compenie tho, that jnto tarmelide with hem gonne go with kyng leodegam forto dwelle jn maner of Sowdiours, as j ?ow telle. [Chapter XIV] Now Forthere to this mater Let Vs pace, ?if that god wyle graunten vs grace, hou that Arthewr past owt of his lond and with hym these kynges, ?e vndirstond, bothe kyng Ban and eke kyng Bors, that weren men of myht and Fors; how that they riden Jn here jorne, Tyl to Tartaysse they comen alle thre, where as lay kyng leodegan, j vndirstond, that was a worthi man of his hond. On palmes-sonne eve jn gonnen they ryde and with hem merlyn that jlke tyde. there thus merlyne rod hem be-fore on a fulfair stede to √æe paleis thore, where as was tho kyng leodegan, that jn ful gret thowht was he than. For kyng ryowns hadde entred his lond with xv o√æer kynges, j vndirstond, and hym they hadden chaced so sore and from place to place dryven hym thore. So that these kynges logged hem alle a-Forn Neblaise cite, as gan be-falle, which cite was riche and plentevous of goodis &amp; of vitaille delicious. wherfore that tyme kyng Leodegan jn herte was a ful hevy man, For he niste how Forto do, nether how his lond defenden hem fro (For jn his Lond hadde he non meyne that Sege to remeven, certeinle), ne how owt of his lond he myhte hem chace; of wheche he axed counseyl jn that place of knyhtes and of othere mo, that at thike tyme weren comen hym to. Jn the mene whyle, whiles here-of they speke, kyng Arthewr and his compenie gonnen jn Reke, and cam to-fore kyng leodegan, that with his barowns cownseil held than. be tweyne and tweyne they entred tho, and jnto his halle they entreden so, and merlyne jn here compenye, but xlij vndir alle, with-owten lye. Ful richely vestured &amp; arayed they were, and alle Berdles bacheleris thanne jn fere Sof √æe two bretheren kynges √æat there weren than, kyng Boors of gawnes and kyng Ban, whiche that to-forn wenten tho; and merlyne √æe message √æere gan do. but alle the lordis √æat with-jnne were, of this peple hadden merveil there. and whanne they comen to-fore the kyng, they hym obeyeden jn worscheping. Anon the kyng ros hem ageyn, as this storye reporteth certeyn, For they semeden ful worthy men be here aray that they hadden then. Thus whanne they weren entred echon, thanne bespak kyng Ban √æere anon, and Salwede kyng leodegan. anon thussone he ?ald him than, and seide that alle welcomen they were‚Äî ‚Äú?if that for good ?e be comen here.‚Äù thanne bespak kyng Ban tho, and to kyng Leodegan he seide vnto: ‚ÄúCertein, Sire, with-owten lesyng, For non maner of evel is oure comeng, Ne not we comen owt of oure contre here jn thy lond Forto noyen the, but as jn manere of socouryng, For sothe as j ?ow seye, Sire kyng, and ?ou to don Servise jn swich degre that to ?oure plesaunce now myhte be. and ?if ?e wilen not with vs don so, Owt of ?oure lond, sire, we scholen go And to Betaken ?ow god Al-myht, that algates he spede ?ow jn ?oure ryht; and we scholen gon jnto an nothir contre, the√æer as men of oure comenge glad wylen be and vs resceyven jn Swich a manere as we to ?ow oure Servise profren here. but certeinly hit was vs tolde that alle manere Of Sowdiours ?e with-holde, and √æerfore was hedyr oure comeng; Therfore ?oure wille telle vs, Sire kyng.‚Äù Thanne answerede kyng Leodegan that with his counseil speken wolde he than. so √æat he axede of hem anon what that were best forto don. and they to him answerid anone that he scholde with-holden hem echone. ‚ÄúFor worthy men they Semen alle, what so evere there-of may befalle. and also hastely as ?e mown don, that ?e knowen here names echon, and whens they ben &amp; of what contre; al this that [?e] knowen jn certeinte.‚Äù thanne partyd leodegan from his cownsaille, and to these Barowns he cam, sauns faylle. ‚ÄúJ merveille mochel of ?oure askyng, &amp; that ?e wilen not discuren ?ow for non thing, ne tellen what ?oure names ben; swich ano√æer meyne haue j not Sen. but goode men me semeth be ?oure chere; that causeth me to resceyuen ?ou here. and ryht welcome mooten ?e be bothe to my Barouns and ek to me as Frendis and felawes to my Socowr, thus to ?ow troste j bothe day &amp; owr. and to this ?e scholen don me affiaunce with me to stonden jnto owttraunce; &amp; as longe as ?e ben jn my compenye, trewly me to helpen ?e scholen me affye. but of on thing j wolde ?ow preye: that what ?e ben, ?e wolden me Seye; and for this cause, ?e vndirstonde: ?e moun ben swich men of o√æer londe, that hit myhte ben gret schame to me of ?ow Servise to taken, certeinle, and that j not of power were ?oure mede to qwyten jn non manere. For j Suppose, ful trewely, that ?e ben grettere men than am j.‚Äù Thanne they answered hym ageyn that him misplesen they nolden, certeyn, but hym to Serve jn Swich degre, that likyngge to hym Scholde hit be. and thus ensurede kyng Ban, certeinlye, For hym and for al his compenye, and that, as hastely as he myhte, alle here names to declaren owt ryhte. Thanne thus departyd they from the kyng jnto the town to taken here loggeng of the beste that they cowden gete. So √æat merlyne hem ladde jnto a strete To ryht a good ?ong mannes hous, that was bothe riche and plentevous and ryht good esement jn alle degre; thydir ladde hem merlyn, certeinle. ek a good womman there was at house, that wel lovede god and ek hire spouse. and him-Self was curteis ek also, and of good lif they weren bothen two. therto hym-Self Blaires hyhte, his wyves name Leonel be ryhte. whanne to √æat hostel √æat they comen there, anon they alyhten al jn fere, and Blayres wente hem ageyn, and seyde they weren welcomen, jn certein. Anon they Answerede Hym Ful sone that he scholde han Crystes benysone. they alyhteden, and jn-to halle they wente, whiche was onestly arayed and gente. and the ?omen loggeden here hors anon, and deden jn stable what was to don. thus there they sojorned viij dayes, not but eten &amp; dronkyn, &amp; merye playes and on morwe they to court wente and ek at even after here talente so thus they servede kyng leodegan with alle the worschepe they cowden than thanne sente forth this kyng anon be sondry messengeris many on that alle thike that myhte armes bere, hem-self to defende, here enemyes to dere, that jn Toraysse they scholde ben on ascencioun even bothe fair &amp; clen. and ho so brak this comandement Jn ony degre be his entent, lik a man-mordrere he scholde ded be and √æerto his good to lesen, ful sikerle. On the tothir syde sente Leodegan of al his kynrede to every man and al aboutes jnto eche contre there he supposede ony sowdiours to be. for he ne sparede for Siluer ne Goold that plente of Sowdiours hauen he woold. So √æat with-owten ony more let at assencioun, √æe whiche was set, xl thousend jn tente and pavyloun weren logged vndir toreyse town what on hors and what on foote with-outen hem of √æe town, wel j wote. jn the mene while that this kyng hadde thus aboutes sent his warneng, happed that vppon the even of may vppon hym entrede, with-owten delay, kyng plariouns &amp; kyng Roallaund, whiche weren bothe of yrland, Ek of assirois kyng Sonigrans, and of √æe same Lond kyng Sorohans. these from the ost comen adown jnto Tarmelyde al jn virown with xv thousend armed ful clene For nede of vytaylle, as that j wene. So hit happede, as hit hem befelle, that nygh to toraysse they com ful snelle, where as soiournede kyng leodegan, that his meyne abod there than. so √æat there was gret noyse &amp; cry of these malfetours, sekerly, that robbede &amp; stroyede that contre. Anon the cite?eines aspiden hit, sykerle, and here ?ates they schetten ful blyve, that owt scholde gon non man on lyve. anon asarmes they gonne to crye, the cheualrie √æat with-jnne was, trewelye, and to-forn the ?ate they semblede anon, knyhtes of √æe rownd table everychon. and the cheventeyn of hem was hervy of Ryvel jn that plas, and malet le bruns was his felawe, that many a man browhten of dawe, with cc. &amp; fyfty jn here compenye of worthy Bodyes, with-owten lye, that vndir hevene non bettere nere thanne tho bodyes that weren there. these be hem-selven weren alone, For with o√æere meddelen wolden they none. On the tother part they gonnen hem dyhte, the cheualrye of √æe towne anon ryhte, And of hem iiij thousend ther were, That myhte Bewelden Bothe Scheld and Spere. this meyne hadden a cheventeyn that cleodalis hyhte, Jn certeyn, that wont was the kynges baner to bere bothe jn pes and ek jn werre. but sethen the knyhtes of √æe rownde table that Lond entreden, with-owten fable, thanne was hervy of Ryvel the kynges banorer everidel. but he bar a lytel gomfaynoun &amp; did it sprede with tweyne Langues be ryht resoun rede, the Feld gold with corowns of ynde. and the grete baner, that cam behynde, whiche that hervy Ryvel Bar, jn this maner was araied thar: with foure langues fayre &amp; pleyne, and there-jnne corouns of gold, jn certeyne, the Feld asure bothe fair and schene; thus this Baner bar he hem betwene. whanne redy armed that they were, aforn the ?ate they sembleden there, and abyden the kynges comeng, that ?it at that tyme was anarmyng. and whanne the kyng j-armed was, anon he asemblede jn that plas, and √æere drowh to hervyes Baner sytteng vppon a good destrer. and √æere he houed with his compenye To knowen of these jresch more certeinlye. On √æe thridde partye was armed than kyng artheur, king Bors, &amp; kyng Ban, and his compenye al jn fere, of wheche but xlij ther were. and ful ryaly they weren adyht, and merlyn here baner bare in fyht. and whanne j-horsed alle they were, thanne to hem Seide merlyn there that thyke day bothe gret &amp; smalle to Sewen his baner, what euere befalle. ‚Äújn what place that evere ?e hit Se, loke ?e hit Sewe and foleweth me.‚Äù and alle they seiden with on cry that So they wolden, ful trewely. thanne so they reden thorwh √æe town, and merlyn bar here gomfaynown. but richere arayed thanne they were, jn that town was neuere seyn there. and here baner was ryht merveyllous Forto beholden and ryht spetous: his Baner hit was on dragown, and not ful gret hit was jn virown; the tayl a kebyt and an half was long, al j-mailled as a serpent ful strong; and his throte so gret &amp; sterne hit was, that hit Semede hem jn that plas so that the tonge that stood with-jnne euere enflawmeng &amp; wolde not blynne, that thorwh the throte owt fyr hit caste vpe jnto the ayr, hit semede hem faste. and jn the mene while the jresch men, that hethen tho weren, as j ?ow ken, with here speres comen to the town, and the ?ates asayllede jn virown. and sethen jnto √æe medewes they wente, &amp; alle the bestes they token, veramente, that abowtes the town jn pasture weren tho; with hem they maden hem forto go. For √æere nas non man hem to defende, Tyl that god sone grace gan sende. thorwgh √æe town paste merlyne anon, There As the peple Weren sembled Echon, and thorwgh that pres redily he paste, tyl to the ?ate he cam atte laste and with hym there al his meyne. Anon to the porter thanne seide he: ‚Äúlet vs now, porter, here owt pace, Fore hit is tyme to comen on place.‚Äù and √æe porter answered hem ageyn that they Scholden not passen hit, Jn certein, with-owten comaundement of the kyng, and thus ?af he hem to answeryng. ‚Äúthat is be misaventure,‚Äù quod merlyn tho, ‚Äúthat thou √æe ?ate ne schalt vndo, whanne that j am as strong as thou, and that Schal j sone preven now.‚Äù Anon kam merlyne to the ?ate, and with his hond pulled there-ate, and pulde √æe ?ate owt from the ston. thanne owt they wenten there echon, ho so wolde or ho so nolde; owt they Riden al glytered jn goolde. Whanne that the two an fowrty men owt of √æe cyte weren passed than, the ?ate closed a?en also faste as hit ne hadde neuere ben vnwraste. For whiche merveille thanne anon these thre kynges blessed hem everichon, and so diden al that companye. but faste forward merlyn gan hym hye, And ouertook of that meyne two thousend hethen jresch, certeinle, and ladden with hem a ful gret praye. thanne anon as merlyne hem saye, anon he Sewede with his Banere, and his compenye holy folewede him there. betwene hem √æere was gret bataille, that certeinly, with-owten faylle, be half a myle nygh hem was non but the xlij there al alon, and token the pray, &amp; lad it ageyn aforn the ?ates tho, jn certein. and they ne hadden not ryden but a stounde, that they Sien vppon the grownde the foure kynges rehersed be-fore with xv thousend men j-armed thore, that with hem ladde so gret plente of kariage &amp; of pray to-ward the se, that they hadde robbed jn that lond, as j do ?ow here to vndirstond. Anon as merlyn Sawh al this, thanne to his feleschepe he cryde, j-wys: ‚ÄúSeweth me now for ony thyng, and ?e scholen Sen a good boordyng.‚Äù there they hym seweden everichon, but euere to-fore merlyne gan gon. and swich a wynd he gan to arere with wondir blastes of tempest √æere, that swich a powdir amonges hem √æere was, amonges here enemyes jn that plas, that non of hem o√æer myhte Se; So merveillous dowst hit was &amp; gret plente. Anon as these two and fowrty men with-jnne these hethen weren entrid than, they beten and slowen so many a-down, that ded abowtes they lyen jn virown. Anon comanded kyng leodegan that the ?ates anon opened weren than; and so they weren jn ryht gret haste, So that thike meyne owt √æere paste. There the Steward Rod forth Be-fore with iiij Thousend men wel armed thore, and they founden the ?ate schet ful faste, there as merlyne and his meyne owt weren paste. with xv thousend they fowhten that whyle √æere Ful merveillously a ful gret tyde in fere. Thanne forth cam cleodalys tho, and to that pres faste gan he go. So that the noyse of speris that √æere were, the brekyng of hem, jnto the cyte was herd there. there was thanne so gret distroccioun of men dede &amp; hors slayn j[n] viroun, So that hit Semede be here gruntyng that hit hadde ben a merveyllous thondryng, but merveillously wrowhte these xlij men that vndir merlynes Banere weren than. Whanne that the iiij kynges Syen al this, that with the cristene they weren thus mellid, j-wis, they departed her meyne anon vntwo, of wheche vij milia to √æe cyte gan go a?ens the baner of kyng leodegan. whanne they aspide hym comeng than, ech of hem a?ens o√æer gan forto ryde, also faste as they myhten that Tyde. and √æe to√æer viij thousend fowhten ful faste, whilles that here strengthe myhte laste. but leodegan and this othir meyne, betwixen hem gret bataylle was, Sikerle, that bothe helmes &amp; hauberkes j-borsten they were, Ne√æer non mail of steel lasten myhte not there, that down they fillen al blody to grownde, For √æere was ?oven many a dethes wounde. And whanne here speris j-borsten they were, anon here swerdis they drowen owt there. thanne began there gret Bataylle, that merveille to beholde hit was, sauns faylle. and namly the knyhtes of √æe rownd table merveillously they fowhten, with-owten fable, of wheche weren but two hundred &amp; fyfty, and of the tothere vij thousend, ful sekerly. but at gret mischef they weren there, that here bodyes gonnen tremblen for fere; and whethir they wolde other none, here grownd to forsaken mad weren they sone. but they helden hem so faste jn fere, that no man with-jnnen hem entren myhte there; Nethir litel ne mochel, lasse ne more, with-jnnen hem entren cowde not thore. whanne Plareouns &amp; kyng Roallaunt To-gideris swich a meyne gonnen se haunt, and of hem so lytel peple there was a?ens so gret meyne jn that plas, Ful gret dispit hadden these kynges bothe, and sworen ful bitterly many a gret othe that of hem askape scholde not on, as ferforthly as they myhten don. Thussone they maden an ordenance Forto han wrowht this meyne mischance. So that xl of that litel compenye weren sore defowlid, with-owten lye. And euer this jresch hethen peyned hem fulsore hem to han de-fowlid ful mochelis more and hem to han maymed, ?if hit myhte han be; but they myhte not thanne for here compene. For with-jnne hem √æere non man there paste, as fer as ony of here dyntes of swerdis myhte laste. And jn this mene whille, as j ?ow telle, vppon kyng leodegan they fowhten ful felle, So that fulsore beten he was jn that place, and there with his enemyes j-taken he was and lad forth there anon tho ryht with v hundred redy armed to fyht. So Hym Forth they Ladden, As J Vndyrstond, towardis kyng Ryown of jrlond, And with gret joye they forth hym ladde, for they wenden the werris ended ben hadde. So thus they hyede hem wondir faste, Tyl owt of the ost that they weren paste. And whanne that kyng leodegan Say this, that with his enemyes he was taken, j-wys, and him forth ladden moche maugre his hed, For sorwen he swownede jn that sted, and wepe ful Sore, &amp; made gret pyte, that jn swich a maner j-taken was he. they hym forth ladden vppon the weye two Skottysch milles, the sothe to seye. but evere the noyse ful gret hit was of the vij thowsend jn that plas and of the cc. and fyfty knyhtes, that a?ens √æe vij thousend held fyhtes, that maden gret sorwe &amp; gret mone, For kyng leodegan was so gone. and whanne they syen, hit wolde non o√æer be, that non reskeus was there, sekerle, they dresseden here bakkes al jn fere, and jn maner of a scheltrom they stoden there, and there thanne so sore they fowhte, that non man deren hem ne mowhte. but they maden gret occisioun of men &amp; hors aboutes hem jn virown with-owten remevyng of ony place; ful mochel peple be hem j-slayn √æere wace. So that they swetten for gret peyne, so hydous the storm was &amp; so sodeyne, that they that atte wyndowes gonnen loke out of the cyte, as Seith the boke, wepten for angwysch &amp; for pyte for the sorewe that they be these knyhtes gonnen se, and merveilled gretly jn here mynde how swich hertis with-jnnen hem myhten they fynde. but whanne gonnore beheld hire fadir dere, that with his enemyes forth lad was he there, Ful gret deol sche gan to make, and riht gret Sorwe to here gan take. Now a whille lete vs here dwelle, and of kyng Artheur lete vs now spelle and also of his compenye, sauns faylle, how that they spedden jn bataylle A?ens viij thousend forto fyhte, thike xlij men of gret myhte, and with hem the steward of Tarmelyde, that cleodalis hyht that tyde. Now reherseth this Storye ryht here of the xlij whiche √æat there were, &amp; of the iiij thousend that cleadalis vndir his Baner browhte, j-wys, whiche with viij thousend j-medled were, that kyng sonigrenx &amp; Sorohanx cowndiet there; of whiche weren manye defoulyd &amp; slayn, as this storye reherseth here jn certayn. And Whanne they Hadden Longe Fowhten Jn Fere, merlyne with his Banere owt prekede there, and to his meyne he cryede Jn gret haste that they hym Scholden folwen faste. and so they dyden ryht Swyftly tho, as faste as here hors cowden renne o√æer go, tyl that they comen jnto on valey, where as these v hundred ladden awey kyng leodagan, here presoner. And anon merlyn ascryed hym ther: ‚ÄúNow, barouns, let Se, kythe here ?oure myht To reskwen the kyng here with ?oure fyht. and but ?if ?e don, he goth his way.‚Äù And evere he cride: ‚ÄúTray, tray, tray!‚Äù So that these knyhtes Sewede on faste, Tyl they hym ouertoken atte laste. Thussone they entred hem betwene with manye gret strokis, as hit was sene, and slowh &amp; maymed al that √æer were, that nowht on his hele hadde there. there √æese xlij maden swich martyrdom, of men &amp; hors a ful gret Som, that vnnethes askaped ony away of thike v hundred, the Sothe to say, Sauf only fyve, that fledden be-fore, anon as kyng leodagan they hadden forlore. And thus Reskwed was Leodagan the kyng, whiche to hym was ful gret merveyllyng, To sen Swich martirdom Jn that plase as of thyke lytel peple j-mad there wase. and whanne he beheld the dragown √æat merlyn bar, thanne wiste he wel his frendis weren thar. thanne thankede he god of that dede, that so his Sowdeours with him dyden spede. Anon merlyn there to hym wente, and √æere hym sesede anon presente. Whanne Vlphyn beheld kyng Leodegan, anon of his hors alyhte he than, and sire Bretel jn the same wyse, anon he alyhte to √æat kyng of pryse, and him vnbownden, &amp; armed hym wel, and sette hym on a destrer bothe good &amp; lel. whanne Bretel &amp; Vlphyn horsid hym hadde jn √æat wise, he thankede hem ful hyhly of here Servise. thanne merlyne began to ascryen eft sone: ‚ÄúNow thynketh, Barouns, what ?e han to done.

For lyk as thondyr here dyntes ferde, that jnto the eyr hit myhte ben herde; For so merveillous was here fyhtyng, that alle that weren jn here stondyng they Slowen down ryht as they come, that to-gederis they lyen on many a throme. and whanne the xlij jn fere amonges tho jeawntis weren entred √æere, thanne began the fyht so strong, that wondir passyng noyse was hem among. so that gonnore, with-owten nay, that hydows noyse myhte heren, Jn fay. there dyde kyng Ban of Baynok, with correcense, his swerd, ?af many a strok.

Thanne kyng Bors √æere smot so Sarmedoun, that bar these jeauntes Gomfanown, that bothen arm, Baner, and scheld ful fer hit fley jnto the feld. these strokes beheld kyng leodagan, and to him-self jn his herte seide than: ‚Äúthere nas neuere kyng, so god me spede, that better socour hadde atte nede.‚Äù and whanne the jeauntes syen here lordes ded, and here banerer was slayn jn that Sted, anon they Tornede hem to the flyht, eche man be hym-Selve, hos gon myht. thanne that Syen they of the cyte, &amp; owte √æere comen a praty meyne, wel two thousend j-armed ful bryht, and folwed that chas √æere anon ryht. but merlyn wente not that contre, For sone to cleodalis thanne turned he, where as he with his iiij thousend men a?ens vij thousend fawht he then, whiche Sonygrenx hadde jn gouernaunce and kyng Sorohaunx with mischaunce. Whanne merlyne cam to that Bataylle, he fond Cleodalis, with-owten faylle, vnhorsed and at the erthe, jn certein, but on his fet he was rekeuered ageyn, and the baner kepte, with-owten lesyng, For that wolde he not leven for non thyng. and abowtes him stoden his compenye, that him defendid ful manfullye, but they weren at gret mischef.

So that theke xlij persones merveillously boren hem for √æe nones, that aftyr the deth of hem, j vndirstond, hit was of hem longe spoken jn that lond, and, as this storye reporteth now here, that So manye Bodyes weren slayn there.

And ?it so wolde not many a man don √æere as cleodalis dyde than, but he dede that many a man wolde not do; For the cause ?e schole knowen also. and ?it wolde he neuere his lord forsake For al the wrong he suffrede &amp; wrake, but euere be him stood in al myschef, as √æowh to hym he hadde ben good &amp; lef. This is the trowthe, As J ?ow telle, how that cleodalis the steward hit befelle. hit behapped that kyng Leodegan a lady of hygh parage wedded had than, and therto she was of gret Bewte, and jnto Tarmelyde browhte hire he owt of hire faderis owne lond, as j do ?ow to vndirstond. &amp; with hire sche browhte a mayden ful gent of wondir gret bewte, verament, whiche mayden cleodalis lovede ful derne, For there-of myhte non man hym werne. So that he preyde leodagan, verament, that he myhte wedden √æat mayden gent For alle his goode longe Servise; he axede no more to his apryse. the kyng hym graunted with riht good wylle, For √æat he was mochel beholden him tylle. and whanne j-wedded hire that he hadde, and from cherche as sche was ladde, and browht was jnto the kynges paleys, and down at mete was set on deys, therto apparaylled ful Ryaly aboven alle ladyes that seten hire by, thanne hadde sche moche more bewte thanne ony o√æer lady, Sykerle; wherthorwh √æe kyng on hire his herte caste, that for non thing a?en myht he hit wreste. So that stylle Leodagan the kyng a gret whylle dwellede jn morneng, For sche was the fairest creature jn ony londe, as this Storye doth me to vndirstonde; and thus at that tyme seyde he no more than. but as hit happede that kyng leodagan at an hygh feste of seynt Johne, Leodagan Cleodalis owt he sente anon a certeyn chevachye forto do vppon his enemyes, √æat hym noyede tho, and his faire lady behinde lefte there the qwene compenye forto bere (For bothen they loveden as paramour, the qweene &amp; sche, with-owten langour)‚Äî hit behappede vppon a nyht, Leodagan be his qwene lay, as wile ryht. that nyht on hire he be-gat tho a fair dowhter, with-owten mo, that jn hire age Gonn[or]e hit hyhte, whiche that was a wondir fair wyhte. this qweene sche was of gret bownte and an holy lyuere, certeinle; and on costom hadde this qweene: √æat but fewe nyhtes hit scholde bene that sche ne wolde to mynstre go hire matynes &amp; servise to heren tho. that same nyht √æat sche conceyved was, To matynes sche ros a ful gret pas, and be the stewardis wyf sche cam ful stille, and fond hire Slepyng, &amp; thowhte non ylle. thanne forth sche wente, &amp; wook hire nowht, To serven hire god, as sche hadde thowht, and lefte this lady there stylle on slepe, that of non creature took sche kepe. Forth wente √æe qweene alone with hire sawtyere to √æe mynstre, that faste by was there. Anon this kyng leodagan tho this lady thowhte to werken wo. and whanne √æat the qweene to mynstre was, anon vp he ros jn that plas, and qweynte alle the lyhtes √æat weren wyt[h]-jnne, For er wolde he √æat tyme not blynne. Sethen to the bed he goth ful ryht, there cleadalis wif lay jnne that nyht. Whanne the Lady Felte On Jn Hyre Bed, sche axede ho was there Jn that sted. ‚Äúhold thou thi pes,‚Äù quod kyng leodagan; ‚Äúand √æou discure me to ony man, vppon my swerd thou schalt deye, j the Swere, dame, be my feye.‚Äù This lady defended hire with al hire myht, but non noyse dorste sche make owt ryht. but lytel avayllede there hire defens, For be hire he lay there jn presens, and that same nyht begat on hire tho ano√æer dowhter ryht also. hit happede, whanne this qweene deliuered was The same nyht of a dowhter jn that plas, the same nyht, with-owten ony faylle, the stewardis wif gan forto travaille, and ano√æer dowhter hadde of gret bewte; a fairrere creature myhte non be. thanne so lyk bothe children they were, that on from anothir knowen myhte not √æere, Sauf gonnore √æat √æe qwenes dowhter was, a wondir mark hadde sche jn prevy plas: vppon the reynes that child behynde hadde √æe fygure as a corowne of a kynge. and but hit were be thike mark, cowde non man hem disseuere jn lyht ne derk. and ech of hem gonnore hyhte, as be here baptem j-named be ryhte. And evere weren they norsched bothe jn fere, tyl that the qweene after deide there. and the kyng aftyr hire deth anon aftyr cleodalis wif sente ful son, and al a?ens that ladyes wylle jn a castel he closede hire ful stille, bencheson that his steward of prise with hire scholde speke jn non wyse. and thus he contenuede v ?er, that cleodalis his wif ne say not ther; til on a day √æe frendis of √æe steward than there-of spoken to kyng leodagan, and hem answerede: whille he hadde werre, he scholde hire not hauen nethir nyh ne ferre. that ?it kepte he hire Stylle jnto the comeng, that jnto his lond entrede artheur the kyng. Now ?it, behold, for al this distresse the steward √æe kyng Servede neuere the lasse. but ?it torneth this Storye ageyn, and of this Steward speketh, certein, how with the jeauntes he fawht on foote, that him and his felawes helden ryhte hote. and after, as processe cometh and tyme, of bothe Gonnores scholen ?e here jn ryme. Evere the bataylle ful gret hit was, there as cleodalys was jn plas. And assone as these xlij men amonges √æat peple weren entred then, they fowhten faste on eche a syde, and moche peple was Slayn that tyde. many speres to-borsten weren there, helmes j-cloven &amp; scheldes jn fere; dede bodyes fillen faste adown, eche man on othir jn vyrown. So that jn √æe feldes al abowte Stedis √æere wenten a ful gret rowte, here reynes hangeng betwene here feet, that eche man forth hem passen let. and euere √æe steward defendid him faste, tyl he was reskwed atte laste. there many a lady was husbondles, and many a sostyr brothirles, and many a modir was childles, Thorwh strokis of cleoda[li]s jn √æat pres. Whanne Sonygranx And Kyng Sorpharouns beheldyn al tho grete distrocciouns and the grete slawhtre that there was, anon kyng Sonigranx jn that plas his trompes let Blowen, his tymbers let bete here mene there forto gaderen to hepe. And anon as assembled they were, Sire kay amonges hem entrede there, Sire Lucans and ek Sire gyrflees amonges hem prekede jnto √æat pres. ech of hem hadde a gret Stowr lawnce, √æer-with amonges hem they gonnen preken &amp; praunce. Anon sire kay kyng Sonygranx mette, and swich a boffet √æere he him sette, that tope ouer tayl he goth to grownde, where as he lay a ful long stownde, that neuere remevede foot ne hand, as j do ?ow here to vndirstand. Ryht tho sire Lucauns and sire girfles slowen tweyne stark ded jn that plas. Whanne kyng Sonygranx to grownde was leyd, anon these hethen maden a gret Breyd hym to reskwe with alle here myht, but that the xlij felawes anon ryht abouten Sonygranx assemblid echon, that thike tyme nyhe hym myhte come non. So that gretly defoulyd he was, as he lay there jn that plas, er that he myhte recoueren ageyn; the hethen abowtis semblede, certeyn. and merline, that bar the Banere, the cccc he cam to refreschen there, and the xlij felawes jn his compenye jn √æat bataylle weren sprad, ful Sekerlye. and cleodalis Sormowntyd was &amp; on a good destrer sette jn √æat plas, and his Baner evere held he stylle. Thanne ascryen he gan with good wille, that tyme assembleden they ful faste, and ho so myhte to-fore gon, they gonne haste. Anon there be-gan a merveillous stour, that was ful of angwis &amp; of dolour. there knyhtes feld men myhten se betwixen hors legges ful gret plente. but of the hethene so gret peple was, that hard it was to entren jn that plas. and so they fowhten evere than &amp; then, tyl atte theke v thousend men that fledden from Torayse atte √æe bataylle, a?en retorneden, with-outen faille. they repeyrede anon to kyng Sorpharins and to kyng Sonigranx, with-owten lesinges. But these xlij goode Saudioures, that jn that Bataylle weren stout &amp; fers, wolde not remeven non foot of lond there as Sonigranx was beten, j vndirstond. Atte laste this Sonigranx remounted was with gret sorwe &amp; peyne jn that plas. thanne began there anon newe bataylle, For avenged wolde he be, with-owten faylle. Anon the kyng sonigranx &amp; his meyne the xlij they hadden envyrownd, Sekerle. thanne entrede merlyne with his baner with al √æe myht that he myhte ther. and the cc &amp; .l. knyhtes of √æe rounde table, they weren Sourmontyd, with-owten fable, and a ful gret pas they comen rydand to √æe banere √æat merlyne bar on hande, and to that part they gonnen drawe, where-offen merlyne was ryht fawe. Whanne that these cc &amp; .l. knyhtes to the bataylle weren sembled jn ryhtes, Amonges Here Enemyes they gonne to Reke, there many a spere gonne they to-breke. and whanne here Speres to-broken were, anon here Swerdis they drowen owt there. So strong was the bataille, certeinle, that hit was wondir to behold &amp; se. On the tothyr partye √æe steward cleodalys with his meyne ful sore fauht, j-wys. but for non power that was hem among, here a stale myhten they not kepen ful long, but sorpharynis to the cyte ward wente ryht velonusly with his entente. thanne cam √æe two thousend of √æe cyte, that toforn tym jn the chas hadden be. and whanne they syen the stywardis banere and with him gret compenie there, anon they torneden jnto that partye. and jn here goynge thedirward, sekerlye, they slowen a thousend jn here comeng, and thanne with cleodalis they maden restyng. thanne there began a newe bataylle, as j ?ow seye with-owten faylle, that the Noyse wel herd myhte haue ben passeng a ful long myle then. this kyng Sorpharyn hadde on his side x thousend men that jlke tyde, and cleodalis hadde on his partye but fyve thousend, certeynlye.

There began Arthewr a merveyllous thing be his owne handis as jn werkyng, as merlyne hym cownseyllede at that tyde, that al the world of hym spak so wyde. and gonnore, that on the walles was than, the dowhter of kyng leodagan, alle the ladyes and √æe maydenis also, to hevene ward here hondis heldyn tho, and preyden for Artheuris Savaciown, that with enemyes was be-set jn virown, and wepten for rowthe and for pyte. So manye hethene a?ens crystyente merveille to suffren there hit was, So ?onge as they weren jn that plas. but kyng Arthewr amongis hem echon distroyede most of alle here fon. For [with] his swerd, that hyhte Calybrond, whiche that he bar √æere jn his hond, bothe on √æe ryhte syde &amp; on the lefte manye hedis &amp; scholderis he hem berefte, legges, armes, &amp; thyes also; bothe knyhtes &amp; hors to grownde gonne go. he made here helmes fleen jnto √æe feld and knyhtes ded fallen vndir here scheld. Ek the Sercles, that weren mad of Stel, a?ens his strok holden myhten non del. but evere abowtes hym good warde √æere was hym forto saven there jn that plas. For a?ens kyng Bors and kyng Ban non maner of armure myhte duren than. thanne so they wrowhten there jn fere, that here strokis dorste non man abyden there, what of hem of the rownde table and of the xlij Sowdiowrs, with-owten fable. For amongis hem was for?eten non thyng, whanne that they comen to here bekeryng. Ful strong was √æe bataylle and the stowr that to-forn √æe cyte of Torayse was √æat owr (and every knyht Jn his owne degre Ful boldly there hym bar, ful Sykirle), and dured al the day, as j ?ow telle, tyl that hit rang with evesong belle. that So nygh they weren to the cyte, Not thens A stones cast, Sykerle. but whanne hit cam to √æe owr of noon tho, of al that day fowhten they not So, that xij thowsend Jnto nyne was browht; at that tyme so sore the crystene √æere fowht. Whanne Sorpharynes Sawhe that hit wente so, anon be his creaunce Swor he tho that he wolde neuere from that grownd gon, tyl that he were venged of his fon. Anon he clepede his kynnes-men than, Sire Gaydone &amp; also Sire Sotybran, Sire Senebant &amp; Sire Claryown, Sire mallors &amp; sire Freellent jn virown; They weren knyhtes bothe goode &amp; bolde, as jn this Storye here hit is tolde. they dressed hem forth alle jn fere amonges theke worthy Sowdyowrs there. hit happede kyng Sorpharyn to meten tho Sire hervy the Ryvel, as hit gan go. and Sire Ryvel he smot so sore that tyde, that down to √æe erthe gan he glyde. and aftyr Ancor he smot also, that down to grownde thanne gan he go. Sethen Sire gyrfles smot he there, that hors &amp; man to grownd he bere. and ech of his felawes smot a knyht, that to the grownde he fyl anon ryht; thanne ech of his felawes bar hym so, and maden here aduersarye to grownde go. but there nas non wondid to √æe ded that felden were jn thyke sted. Sire Lucans √æe botelers happed thanne thus, Sire meraungis &amp; sire Gorvayns Caradus, Sire blyobers, sire galeys luchauns, as telleth this tale, Sire kay √æe steward &amp; sire guniret of lambale, ek Sire Godam and Sire staungot, the nithe was sire Bretel, wel j wot: alle these jn the feld j-feld they were. but non man wyste the sothe there, whethir be strok of lawnce hit was or be defawt of here hors jn that plas. thanne a ful gret noysse there began and a wondir gret dowst forsothe than, that non of hem othir myhten se, as this storye reherseth certeynle. but evere the hethene peynede hem faste the cristene to distroyen Jn alle haste. Anon these worthy nyne knyhtes vppon here Feet keuerede anon ryhtes. with here naked swerdis on honde Styfly to-gederis gonne they stonde, and Fowhten with hem with alle here myht For there began thanne a ful strong fyht. but lytel hit avayllede at that Tyde, For the jeauntes on hem ful sore gonnen abyde. thanne cam merlyne to here socour with his Baner on hande jn that stowr. Anon kyng Sorpharynes, that jeaunt, tho To kyng leodagan thanne gan he go, and smot hym evene amyddis the scheld, that hors and man Fyl jn the Feld. So lowe bar Sorpharynes his spere there: kyng leodagan[s] hors Slowh he there, So that bothe they lyen atte grownde, kyng leodagan &amp; his hors, that stownde. whanne they of the cyte behelden this, Gret sorwe they maden &amp; cryden, j-wys, For they wendyn kyng leodagan hadde be ded; So sore he Fyl there jn that sted. thanne to here reskews eche man wente, and sore they fowhten with good entente. whanne that kyng Artheur herde this of that stowt jeawnt &amp; grym, j-wys, That feld hadde fowre so worthy men, kyng Artheur swor anon ryht then that on √æeke jeaunt hym-self wolde asaye To Weten Whethyr of Hem Bettere cowde playe. Jnto that reng kyng arthewr wente with a boystous spere on honde, veramente, the hed ful Scharpe and wel j-grownde, and forth he rod jn that Stownde. hit happede that a?ens hym cam kyng ban, and to kyng Artheur there seide he than: ‚Äúwith whom thenken ?e to josten here? not with this jeaunt jn non manere! For to ?ow he is to strong jn this Felde, For ?e ben ?it but of ?ong elde. but let now me a?ens him go Forto asayen what j may do. For j am eldere of age than ?e and ek, j trowe, strengere, certeinle.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow god Forbede,‚Äù quod kyng artheur tho, ‚Äúthat evere ony man but j hym go to.

Go, coward, and do as thou scholdest do.‚Äù and whanne kyng Artheur herde merlyne speken so, and that coward he clypede hym thanne, Ful sore aschamed was √æat worthy manne. Anon he prekede jnto that pres, that for non thing ne wolde he ses. thanne anon bespak kyng Ban, and √æere to merlyne seyde he than: ‚Äúme thynketh hit is not ryht wel do to chargen Artheur forto don so, So ?ong a man as Arthewr now js a?ens that gret devel to josten, j-wys.‚Äù ‚Äúthere-offen non warde,‚Äù quod merlyn tho, ‚Äúbut tak ?oure spere and aftyr hym ?e go, and ?owre brothir and Vlphyn jn compenye; aftyr hym faste that ?e don hye.‚Äù his comandement they fulfylden in haste, also swithe as here hors myhten laste. whanne kyng Sorpharynes Sawh Arthewr there, anon a?ens hym he gan forto bere. And whanne they of the reng behelden this, thanne hoveden they alle stylle, j-wys. For of Arthewr they hadden gret drede, lest that the jeawnt hym scholde ouer-lede. So sore to-gederis they metten atte laste, that bothe here speres there al to-barste. Sorpharynes Arthewr jn √æe flanke hyrte, that a lytel hit gan hym smerte. and Artheur smot him so sore ageyn thorwh Scheld and hauberk, jn certeyn, that thorwgh the chyne the spere owt glod an arme lengthe behynde, er hit with-stod, that bothe hors and man to grownde they wente evene tope ouer tayl thanne, veramente. These Justes beheld this lady gonnore, the dowhter of kyng Leodegan, √æat was thore, as sche atte a fenestre wyndowe lay; sche beheld al theke bataylle that day, and merveyllede what this Bacheler was, that there so wel bar hym jn that plas. Non wyht his name cowde tellen that owr, but that hit was on a worthy Sowdyowr‚Äî ‚Äúthat ?oure fadyr hath now with-holde; what so evere he be, he is a man ful bolde.‚Äù ‚ÄúSertes,‚Äù quod the mayden tho, ‚ÄúFrom goode men nedis cam he fro. For but ?if of hygh blood that born he were, he cowde neuere so handelen ne√æer scheld ne spere.‚Äù So that al thyke day jnto the ende of the sowdiours to speken sche wolde not lende. Anon kyng Bors and kyng Ban Jnto that Reng anon entred than, eche of Hem With a spere Bothe myhty and strong, with hedis scharpe j-grownden, bothe stordy and long. There kyng Bors smot Sortybran, and kyng ban smot Claryel than; Vlphynes smot Sire Gaydon jn √æat plas, that of his lyf bereft he was. so that these jeauntes to dethe weren browht; thanne eche man his enemy owt √æere sowht. ?it forthere these thre gonnen to ryde, So that eche of hem ano√æer slowhe that tyde. the ton slowh moras, the tother Laundon, the thrydde senebawnt he slowh anon, So that stylle they leften there, tyl that awey they were born on bere. Anon kyng Artheur his swerd gan drawe, For eft to fyhten he was ful fawe. Sire mallore there he smot that day thorwh-out the helm, the sothe to say, For that he lay vppon kyn[g] Ban; ful bytterly he smot hym than, and so he dede Sire Freelent, that bothen purposeden with good entent For to han had kyng bannes hed Evene from the body jn that sted. For the ton his helm wolde han of drawe, the to√æer with a mas wold han hym Slawe. thanne lefte not kyng Artheur for non of this, but welsone mallore? hed he hadde, j-wys, and mad hit flen jnto the feld bothe from body and ek from scheld. Whanne Freelent Sawh his felawe ded, that was his cosyn, jn that sted, his mas he gan lyften ful hye kyng Artheur to han smeten, Sekerlye. Artheur his scheld threw vpe anon, that √æe strok hym scholde not lyhten vppon. and so sore he smot jn that tyde, that jnto √æe feld √æe scheld gan glyde and vppon the lefte scholdere decendyd adowne, that on √æe hors nekke hit stynte wel son. and vpe a?en freellent wolde han rekured his mas; anothyr thowhte Artheur jn that plas. he smot his hors with his speres tho, and a?en to Freellent gan he go, and vppon the helm hym hytte √æere jn hy, that Jnto the gorget hit wente ful ny. thanne the hethene gonnen forto crye, For sore aferd weren they, sekerlye. For socowr non hadden they thar but only of Raundolk, √æat the baner bar. to hym rod kyng Ban wel swithe, and a good strok hym rawhte ful blythe, that bothe the arm and baner also jnto the feld bothe flowen tho. thussone welfaste √æese theves gonne crye, and aweyward faste they gonne hem hye. hanne the chas so longe dyde laste, yl thyke day was al apaste. So that many men j-slayn ther were, that of th[e] ix thowsend √æat weren there, nas left but .v. thousend, √æe sothe to say, whiche that faste gonnen flen here way. and to kyng ryown they wenten ful faste, where as at √æe sege he was ful preste, and tolden kyng ryown everydel how that be hem hit be-fyl, and of the grete mortalite that amonges hem was, ful sekerle. hanne swor kyng ryown be his Sewrte √æat he wolde not owt of that contre, Tyl he hadde taken kyng Leodagan And Jn His presown to Hauen Hym than. Thanne sente kyng ryown jnto his lond aftyr more meyne, as j vndirstond, thorwh-owt denmark, al that contre, bothe high &amp; lowgh, of eche degre, and viaunde jnowh with hem to brynge, that may two ?er to-gederis ben durenge For cc thousend of Fyhtyng men; that vytaylle mowe Sufficen than. For that werre he wolde begynne wel strong and vigerously werren hem among. So that they sembleden every day, that with-jnne a mounthe, [the sothe] forto say, cc thousend and Fyfty men with-jnne that mounthe weren sembled than, of wheche xx kynges ther were To kyng Ryown comen there. Gret karyage they browhten with hem also of wynes, of vytaylle, as was forto do. So that here ost they kepten jn fere, that for non vyaunde ferreyen scholden they there, but ?if hit be jn-to on partye; For plente of viaunde hadden they, Sekerlye. Faste they asaylleden the cyte there, but they with-jnne of hem hadden non fere, For the cyte was bothe byg and strong. But skars of vetaylle was hem among, that was here drede for enfamyneng, lest the Sege were longe dureng. thus cam Socour thanne every day To kyng Ryown, the sothe to Say. For welsore agreved he was of the meyne he hadde lost jn that plas. Now leveth of this mater here, Of kyng Ryown &amp; of his ost jn fere and of hem with-jnne the cyte. And of kyng Arthewr speke now we and of his felawes jn compenye; Now to that mater let vs faste hye. This Storye here declareth a newe tale, how these hethene jeauntes weren browht in bale, and how glad that they of the cyte and joyful weren, whanne they gonnen fle, Ek that so lytel a compenye hem hadde j-scomfyted, certeinlye, that jn al but vj thousend an ccc were; a?ens xv thousend they fowhten there. and the scomfyture only hit was be merlynes helpe and goddis gras. whanne the hethen they hadde chased jnto √æe nyht, thanne to Torayse they torneden anon ryht, where as was kyng leodagan; Ful joyful and merye weren they than. For leodagannes men hadden hym vp take, whilles the Sowdiours wrowhten the hethen wrake. And whanne Leodegan wiste the Sowdiowrs comenge, a?ens hem he wente jn cowntrynge. Wondir gret joye thanne made the kyng, whanne they to-gederis comen jn metyng. But Whanne Sire Antron And Girflet they fownden √æere, Sire kay &amp; Sire Lucawns the Botelere, and alle here o√æer Feleschepe, bothe h√≤l &amp; sownd, thanne weren [they] joyful vppon that grownd. For they wenden, ded that they hadden be o√æer ellis taken presoner, certeyinle. and they hadden wonne good gret plente; Anon kyng leodagan, Sekerle‚Äî anon to the Sowdeowrs hit was to sent, with that good hem forto present. For better he wolde, and he bettere myhte do, but natheles that thedyr sent he tho. Whanne they seyen the grete curtesye that kyng leodegan dede openlye, they hym thankede a thouse[n]d Sythe, and to that messenger seyden as blythe: ‚Äúwe thanken the kyng of his gret sonde; let hym depart yt forth Jn his londe! and anothyr tyme, whanne we hauen nede, we wylen resceyven that he vs bede.‚Äù thanne cam merlyne Faste anon, and to the thre kynges gan he gon, and bad hem Resceyven ouer alle thyng the presentes that to hem sente √æe kyng. So they hit took, as merlyn hem bad, and amonges √æe peple distrebucioun they mad, and leften not the valw of on peny To here owne partis, ful Sekerly. So that alle men of that contre Tho Sowdyowrs preyseden ful hertele. So that the contre repleynsched was abowte of √æe goodis √æat they ?oven, with-owten dowte. For hem that the Sowdeours neuere Sye, mochel worschepe hem spoken, certeynlye, and al for here largenesse &amp; here good dede thorwh-owt the rem of hem gan sprede. And al this was be merlynes cownsaille, as j ?ow Seye with-owten faylle. Artheur to his ost he ?af that day bothe Richesse, and Robes, and many palfray; that alle the dayes aftyr of here lyve moche bettere myhten they bothen thryve. Whanne that kyng Arthour hadde thus j-do, and alle the richesses departyd so, that vppon the hethene they hadden gete (hit was departyd, er he wolde lete), thanne they gonnen entren jnto √æe town with al here feleschepe jn virown. thanne seide kyng Leodegan tho to alle the Sowdiowrs, as they gonne go, and wolde non Suffren with al his myhte Jn that town there Forto alyhte Sauf only at his owne paleys; he hem besowhte, with-owten les. Nether neuere owt of his compenye he ne wolde not Suffren hem, trewelye, but with the knyhtes of the rownde table with hem jn compenye to ben, with-owten fable. And whanne vnarmed that they were, kyng leodagan his dowhter to hem sente there with the richest robes that he hadde, dame gonnore, his dowhter, to hem ladde, and hot water to waschen hem Jn jn bacenis of gold bothe goode &amp; fyn. but Arthewr of hem wolde taken non Servyse, Tyl kyng leodagan comaunded jn alle wyse and merlyne Bad hem there also The Servyse of hem to taken tho. So that the gentyl damysele anon whisch tho thre kynges be on and on, bothe Artheuris Body and his nekke also and face, &amp; with a towaylle wypte hem tho. And ek bothe kynges jn the Same manere that gentyl gonnore wesch ryht There. and the tothyr gonnore, √æat begeten was on cleodalis wyf with-jnne his plas, Servede al the tothyr compenye With Helpe of othere Damyselys, certeynlye. whanne that gonnore Leodaganes dowhtyr, J-wys, these thre kynges hadde Servyd thus, thanne hire owne fadyr, kyng leodagan, hym forto waschen this mayden gan than. and whanne that thus j-waschen they were, Gonnore to ech of hem a mentyl took there. kyng Arthewr was a man ful of bewte, and that beheld this mayden, ful certeynle. And kyng Artheur beheld hyre also; So mochel of Bewte hadde sche tho. thanne so they spoken betwixen hem tweyne, that to Arthour this damysele gan Seyne that glad jn herte sche was, Sekerle, of swich a worthy body beloued to be. Thanne whanne al this was J-do, on the morwe to mete scholden they go. So that they weschschen &amp; seten a-down, these worthy thre kynges &amp; amonges hem non. And alle the knyhtes of √æe rownde table benethen the Sowdiours seten, sauns fable. but bothe kyng Bors and kyng Ban betwixen hem bothe setten Artheur than. For they deden hym ful gret honour, For he was a man of gret valour. kyng leodagan took gret kep tho of the reuerence they gonne hym do, and vndirstood wel be here Servyse that here souereyn he was jn alle wyse, and merveyllede gretly what he scholde be, For fayn wolde he han wyst, Sykerle. and to hym-Self he thowhte ryht there that he hadde weddid his dowhter gonnore. For he sawh neuere man of swich entaylle, but of hygh blood he were, saun? faille. ‚ÄúO√æer ellis the goode Lord jn maieste thys man for socour hath sent to me, a spiryt to ben jn mannes lyknesse this rewm to defenden from distresse, j wot wel, not only for the loue of me, but for the Sustenaunce of crystyente and ek holy chirche Forto meynteyne.‚Äù thus to hym-Self kyng Leodagan gan seyne. At that mete mochel thowhte than this worthy kyng Leodagan how that he reskewed was, jn feye, with xlij felawes jn the valeye, that hym reskewed of .v. hundred men, whiche that to preson ward ladden hym then, and browhten hym a-geyn with gret richesse, and Slowen alle tho that weren jn that prese. So that for thowht that he was jnne ther, nothyng he ete at his dener. Thanne that aspyde hervy the Revelle, and √æere-offen hadde merveylle euerydelle. Anon to the table to hym he wente, and there hym aresoned, veramente. he seide that neuere sethen he was bore‚Äî ‚ÄúSay j ?ow neuere of swich chere before, ne neuere abasched So, jn good fay, as ?e ben here this jlke day.
