Ambra is a spicerye, Of gret pris, smelleÃ¾ swotelye: Ãerof is called Ã¾is name Ambrose: For riht as hit sauereÃ¾ in monnes nose Riht so dude he in word and dede, Monnes soule to gete gret mede; And precious was to holy churche: Doctur he was and tauhte to worche Cristene men heore God to plese, In charite to lyue and pese. OÃer elles Ã¾ou mai?t sei Ã¾at Ambros Is seid of ambra and syos: Syos is to seyn Â»GodÂ« riht, And ambrum good sauour pliht. Ãenne, for he wiÃ¾ good preching Made men knowe God ouer alle Ã¾ing, God is good sauur to vche mon Ãorwh his techinge, Ã¾at good con. For Ambros is and also was Good Cristes sauour in eueri plas. OÃer Ã¾ou mai?t wel diuise Ãe nome of Ambros in Ã¾is wyse: Ambrum is to seye fadur of liht, And syon a luytel child ful riht. Ãen Ambros him seluen Is fadur of moni gostliche children, He was lihtful in expounyng Holy writ, wiÃ¾outen lesyng, In conuersaciun he was eke Riht as a chyld wondurliche meke. OÃur Ã¾ou mai?t expoune hit, and not varie, As seiÃ¾ Ã¾e bok, iclept Glosarie: Ambrum is heuenlich smel of sauour: So sauerede he in halle and bour In gode fame and contemplaciun, He hedde gret deuociun. Celestis Ambrosia, wiÃ¾outen lete, Is vndurstonden Angles mete: Ãat is to seyn Ã¾at inward siht Ãat Ambrose hedde in God Almiht. ÃIs word also Ambrosium Is to seyn al and sum An heuenliche honycombe: Ãat hedde seint Ambrose in his wombe Ãorwh swetnesse of exposicioun Of holy writ in religioun. Now haue I expouned his name, And hou he sauered in gode fame. HerkneÃ¾ nou, hosbonde and wyf, And i schal tellen ou of his lyf, Riht as a clerk, was clept Paulin, Wrot hit to seint Austyn. AMbrose of Rome was prefecte, And of his wyf wiÃ¾outen lette He gat a child, was clept Ambrose, Ãat mon was aftur of gret lose. Hit bifel vppon a day, Whil he was ?ong, in cradel he lay, And, forte stille him of his wepe, Rokked he was and fel on slepe; Ãer he lay wiÃ¾ open mouÃ¾. Ãen ful a cas wondur selcouÃ¾: For sodeynliche a cumpaygnye Of beon Ã¾er come, swiÃ¾e monie, His mouÃ¾ Ã¾ei fulden and his faceâ Ãat men se?en wel in Ã¾at place,â Ãei fullen in and out blyue As Ã¾ei? his mouÃ¾ hedde ben heor hyue. And afturward Ã¾ei toke Ã¾e fliht In to Ã¾e eir so fer on hiht Ãat no mon mihte on eorÃ¾e wiÃ¾ e?e Seo Ã¾is ben whodur Ã¾ei dude fli?e. Whon his fadur Ã¾is wondur hedde seyn, He seide, as mon Ã¾at was riht fayn: Â»Ãis child, i wot, so mot i Ã¾eo, Sum gret mon schal he beo.Â« Whon Ã¾is child com to fourtene ?ere Of age, he wente ofte tyme in fere WiÃ¾ modur and sustur to Ã¾e churche, Goode dedes forte worche. He tok good hede to vndurstonde Hou Ã¾ei cussed Ã¾e prestes honde. Whon he com hom, he wolde, iwis, Profre his sustur his hond to cus, And he wolde sei on his pleying Ãat moste heo do nedelyng. For he was ?ong, non hede heo tok, Heo wolde him bidde go to his bok. Whon he was lettred and vndurstod, Monye causes, bi Ã¾e rod! In Ã¾e noble cite of Rome Sikerliche he vndurnome, Rihtfuliche he hedde in mende And lawefuliche brouhte hem to ende. Whon Ã¾e emperour parceyued Ã¾is, To him he sende anon iwis, To gouerne Ã¾e prouinces of Lygurie And also of Emylye.

Whon men made him Ã¾en askyng Whi Ã¾at he made such serwyng And wepte for holy men and murie Ãat passed weren vp to glorie, He wolde onswere: Â»ne leeue ?e nouht Ãat i Ã¾us wepe and falle in Ã¾ouht, Out of Ã¾is world for Ã¾ei ben gon To him Ã¾at mad vs euerichon, But for Ã¾ei ben gon tofore me, And for hit is hard, so mot i Ã¾e, Forte fynden aftur such a mon Ãat such an offys so wel do con.Â« HE was of so good constaunce And strong in spiryt in eueri chaunce: Ãouh emperour or kyng in dede were nice, He nolde not suwe hem in no vice, But he wolde in certeyne WiÃ¾ opene vois him wel repreyne. ÃEr was a mon Ã¾at wikkedliche An vuel dede hedde don openliche.

VPpon a tyme bi godus dome Seint Ambrose tok Ã¾e wei to Rome, And in a toun, Ã¾at hette Trissye, He was herborwede, sikerlye, At a riche monnes hous, Ãer he in dwelled and his spous.

God hit him graunted specialiche: An angel him warned priueliche. Whon he was war of Ã¾at day Ãat he schulde passe hennes away, Ãerof he was joyful and feyn And tolde his breÃ¾eren in certeyn Ãat til Ã¾e feste of Ã¾e resureccioun He schulde wiÃ¾ hem dwelle her doun.

Whon Ã¾at he Ã¾erof was war, He criede and made muche far And bad men schulde hire bidde forÃ¾ gon, For of hir charmes wolde he non. Ãe child anon, witterli, Ãerfore felede Godus merci, For Ã¾e ache was went awey, And he aros and went to pley. VPpon a cristemasse niht To Ã¾e churche he wente forÃ¾ riht And abod Ã¾er wiÃ¾inne; And whon matyns schulde biginne, He coueyted wiÃ¾ al his miht To wite what hour of Ã¾e niht Crist vr saueour was bore.

Afturward Ã¾erfore wel sone Of vr ladi and hire sone In Ã¾e biginning of his makyng He made a wondur worching, Ãat is: a lessun of gret leornyng, To vche monnes heryng, In Ã¾e whuche he expouned Ã¾e gospel Missus est angelus Gabriel.

Seint Bernard Ã¾erof wondur had And Ã¾e sadul bringe to him he bad; He hedde riden fro Cleruous Til he com to Charthous, What maner sadel he rod inne Wuste he neuere, more ne mynne. ON a tyme his wey lay Al a dayes jurnay Bi Ã¾e lake of Lausan, Ãat knoweÃ¾ wel mony a man. He wente so Ã¾er al in Ã¾ouht Ãat Ã¾e lake sauh he nouht. At niht whon his felawes eke Of Ã¾at lake gunne to speke, He hem asked for his oune sake Ãei schulde him telle wher was Ã¾e lake. Whon Ã¾at Ã¾ey so asken him herde, Ãey wondred muchel whi he so ferde. ÃE hei?enes of his name WiÃ¾ meknes of herte he ouurcame; Al Ã¾e world miht him not reise: So he him self wolde dispreyse. Of men he was holden mest, But he him self heold aller lest; Eueri mon wolde him putte forÃ¾, But he huld him self lest worÃ¾. Ofte tyme he wolde knowleche Ãat, whon he herde of him gret speche And was among most honour And in Ã¾e peples feire fauour, Bi him self he Ã¾houte ri?t wel As mon Ã¾at weore chaunged eueridel, And he him self hedde such entent Ãat he huld him as absent, And trouwed hit hedde ben a sweuen Ãat falleÃ¾ on him Ã¾at slepeÃ¾ at euen. But whon he was among symple men, As his breÃ¾eren weoren Ã¾en, Ãat he mihte vse his mekenes WiÃ¾ frendschipe and goodnes: Ãen he wolde be wondur glad, As mon Ã¾at to lyf beo turned had. Euere a mon mihte him fynde Preyinge or redyng or writynge Or in good meditacion Or to his breÃ¾eren in edificacion. VPpon a tyme he stod vp to preche To Ã¾e peple, and hem dude teche; Men herden him bisyliche And token his wordus deuoutliche. Whil he Ã¾us was in his predicacion, Ãer ful on him such a temptacion Ãat to him self: him Ã¾hou?te, he seide, As he auctorites forÃ¾ leide: Â»For Ã¾ou prechest nou in Ã¾e best And Ã¾e herkneÃ¾ nou boÃ¾e mest and lest, On Ã¾e to loke Ã¾ei ben bolde, Of hem alle wys Ã¾ou art holdeÂ«. Whon he biÃ¾ou?t him vppon Ã¾is, Temptacion he hit heold iwis, A luytel while stille he stod And biÃ¾ou?t him on his mood Wher him weore bettere forÃ¾ to sey Or elles let of and go his wey. Ãorwh Godus help, Ã¾at nul not fayle, Anon riht of good counsayle To Ã¾e temptour softeliche He seide Ã¾eos wordus wyslyche: Â»Beo Ã¾e made I not my biginninge, Ne for Ã¾e nul I make non endyngeÂ«, And forÃ¾ Ã¾en aftur deuoutliche He prechede Ã¾e peple bisyliche. A monk ones he hedde wiÃ¾ him. Ãat in Ã¾e world was sum tym A ribaut and a pleyer grete, Whon Ã¾at he mihte wiÃ¾ felawes mete. Ãe deuel him tempted so, certeyn, Ã¾at to Ã¾e world he wolde go ?eyn. Whon Bernard sauh he wox so bolde Ãat he him noÃ¾ing mihte wiÃ¾holde, He asked him, as he hedde iÃ¾riue! Hou he schapt him forte lyue. Anon he onswerd and gon to seye: Â»At Ã¾e echesse i con wel pleye: ÃerwiÃ¾ schal I liue riht wel And winne Ã¾at me nedeÃ¾ eueridelÂ«. Seint Bernard Ã¾en gon to him seye: Â»?if i take Ã¾e Ã¾e chef moneye, WiÃ¾ to pleye, woltou be my feer And come a?ein ?er bi ?er And parte wiÃ¾ me half Ã¾i wynnyng And take Ã¾e toÃ¾urdel to Ã¾i liuyng?Â« Whon he Ã¾at herde, he was ful glad And Ã¾erof wiÃ¾ him god couenaunt mad. Seint Bernard in hy?ing Comaundet him twenti schilyng. He Ã¾enne Ã¾erwiÃ¾ went his wey, WiÃ¾ his felawes in Ã¾e world to pley. Seint Bernard dude Ã¾is, for certeyn, Forte make him come a?eyn: And so hit ful Ã¾e nexte ?ere, Anon riht as ?e schul here. Ãis mon went aboute faste to pleye, And lost faste his moneye, Atte laste he lost al togedere And leue hedde to pley him wiÃ¾ a fedre. To Ã¾e abbey ?ate Ã¾en he went, As a mon worÃ¾i beo schent. Whon seint Bernard Ã¾erof herde, Ful gladly out to him he ferde And huld his lappe abrod, lau?whyng, And asked him half his wynnyng. He seide: Â»fadur, nay nay, But I haue lost vr chef monay. I preye ow for charite, For Ã¾at moneye tac nou meÂ«. Seint Bernard of his godnesse Seide Ã¾us to him wiÃ¾ mekenesse: Â»SeÃ¾Ã¾e hit is so, beter me is Take Ã¾e, Ã¾en leose al at onusÂ«. SEint Bernard to a place wolde go, Vppon his hors he set him Ã¾o. Beo Ã¾e wei as he rod, He mette wiÃ¾ a boistes mon of mod; ForÃ¾ wiÃ¾ him Ã¾en gon he walke, Of diuerse maters Ã¾ei gunne to talke. Atte laste, wiÃ¾outen fable, Ãei speken hou a mon schulde beo stable And Ã¾enke vppon non oÃ¾ur Ã¾ing, Whyl he weore in his preying. Ãe cheorl Ã¾erof hedde dispyt And bad he schulde him nou?t edwyt, He seide his herte was al stable, Â»And forte preye hit is nou?t able, But hit beo wiÃ¾outen eny lettyng Of eny oÃ¾ur maner Ã¾yngÂ«. Seint Bernard caste Ã¾enne anon To ouercome his presumpcion; Â»Ãat i schal seoÂ«, he seide, Â»parde! WiÃ¾drauh Ã¾e sumwhat from me. Ãi pater noster loke Ã¾ou biginne WiÃ¾ al Ã¾e entent Ã¾at Ã¾e is inne; And ?if Ã¾ou mowe wiÃ¾ stable mende WiÃ¾outen lettyng make an ende, Ãe hors, forsoÃ¾e, Ã¾at i on sit, ?if Ã¾ou soÃ¾ seye, Ã¾ow schalt haue hit!

Hardiliche he wente him fro, His pater noster bigon he Ã¾o WiÃ¾ as god wille and talent As he couÃ¾e, and good entent. He nas vnneÃ¾e Ã¾e middel ipast, Ãat in his herte anon he cast WheÃ¾er he mihte Ã¾e sadel craue WiÃ¾ Ã¾e hors Ã¾at he schulde haue. Whon he abreid out of Ã¾at Ã¾ouht, He wuste wel he was worÃ¾i nouht. He wente forÃ¾ to Ã¾at holy mon And tolde al to gedre Ã¾on What mater ful in his mende, His pater noster or he mihte ende, And ?af him to deuocioun, Forsok eke his presumpcioun. HE hedde ischoren his kinnes man, Ãat frere Robert men called Ã¾an: Ãat men brouhten aftur in such deuocion Ãat he wente to Ã¾e abbey of Cloun; He wende he hedde idon riht wel, And was bigyled eueridel.

As Bernard a lettre gon to endyte, AnoÃ¾er monk also hit to write: As Ã¾ei seten Ã¾er oute, in certeyn, Ãer fel a gret drift of reyn; He Ã¾at Ã¾e lettre a writen scholde, For fere togedere he gan hit folde. To him Ã¾en seyde seint Bernard: Â»Loke Ã¾ou beo noÃ¾ing aferd To write forÃ¾, as a clerk, For Ã¾is nou Godus werkÂ«. Among al Ã¾e reyn Ã¾e lettre he wrot: Ãeron ful no drope, God hit wot, Hit reyned aboute oueral, But Ã¾eron ful nouÃ¾ur gret ne smal. IN a munstre Ã¾at he hedde mad, And a couent of beryng sad, Hit biful Ã¾at mony anuy?es Ã¾ey hedden Ã¾erin Ã¾orwh noumbre of fli?es. Whon Ã¾at com to Bernardus ere, Â»I hem curseÂ«, he seide, Â»al in fereÂ«. Vppon Ã¾e morwe alle weore founde Ded liggyng vppon Ã¾e grounde.

But seynt Syri on Godus part Ãouhte to do worschipe to seint Bernard, And lete hire passe as heo com. And Ã¾ei tornd alle a?ein hom, And a?eyn to seint Bernard Ãey hire ladden afturward. Ãe fend seide Ã¾an wiÃ¾ gret schout: Â»Seint Syri me naÃ¾ not cast out, Ne Bernard schal neuer Ã¾e moÂ«. Seint Bernard onswered anon riht Ã¾o: Â»NouÃ¾ur Syry ne Bernard Ã¾e schal out cast, But Jhesus Crist atte lasteÂ«. Seint Bernard made his orisoun To God wiÃ¾ gret deuocioun: Anon Ã¾e fend Ã¾en gon to sey: Â»Ful fayn wolde i go my wey Out of Ã¾is luytel croume brid Ãer mony day i haue me hid, For nou i suffre muche wo, And fayn wolde I henne go, But I may not haue mi miht For Ã¾e grete lord of rihtÂ«. Seint Bernard Ã¾enne asked Ã¾is word: Â»Who is Ã¾at ilke grete lord?Â« Ãe fend onswerde wiÃ¾ foul breÃ¾: Â»Hit is Jhesus of NazareÃ¾Â«. Â»Bernard him asked for Ã¾e nones: Â»Sauh Ã¾ou him euere? sei me at ones!Â« And he onswerde Ã¾enne a?eyn: Â»?e, ?e haue i him seynÂ«.

And Ã¾at scrouwe was no more ne min But Ã¾eose wordus on latin: In nomine domini nostri Jhesu Cristi precipio tibi, demon, ne hanc mulierem amodo contingere presumasâ Ãat is to sei vnto Ã¾e ende: Â»I Ã¾e comaunde, Ã¾ou foule fende, In vr lord Jhesu Cristes name, Ãis wommon Ã¾at Ã¾ou ne touche ne tameâ No more loke Ã¾ou beo so hardiÂ«. Whon Ã¾e hosbonde hedde so don soÃ¾ly, Ãe fend nas so hardi afturward To come a?ein, for seint Bernard. AT Aquitayne was a wommon Ãat a fend hedde so bigon And idon so gret anuye, Ãat wiÃ¾ hire he dude lecheryeâ Such a fend, as Ã¾e bok telleÃ¾ vs, Is icalled Incubus.

Â»Wommon, he seide, in Ã¾e nome of Ã¾e trinite Tac nou here my staf to Ã¾e And in Ã¾i bed loke Ã¾ou hit lay; What he may do Ã¾enne, let him assayÂ«.

Whon heo to seint Bernard tolde Ã¾is, He called Ã¾e peple togedere iwis And bad Ã¾at vche mon schulde fonde, A brennynge candel holde in his honde.

Ãe emperour ros vp wiÃ¾ gret fere And herkned wel wiÃ¾ herte and ere Al Ã¾at euere seint Bernard bad, And parfourned hit wiÃ¾ herte ful sad. VPpon a tyme, al in certayn, In to Ã¾e kyngdom of Germayn Seint Bernard tok Ã¾e wey forÃ¾word, For to seese a gret disscord Ãat was Ã¾er amongus hom.

Whon Ã¾e clerk seynt Bernard mette, Loueliche Ã¾enne he him grette And seide: his lord him sente had, Him to welcome wiÃ¾ herte glad. Seint Bernard onswerd wiÃ¾ dim entent: Â»AnoÃ¾ur lord, sire, Ã¾e haÃ¾ sentÂ«.

But as Ã¾ei wolken bi Ã¾e wey, Seint Bernard tornde his herte, in fey, Ã¾at he Ã¾e world Ã¾enne al forsok And habyt of monk of him he tok. VPpon a tyme Ã¾orwh Goddus miht Seint Bernard hed schoren in a kniht Ãat in werres tofore hedde iswonke And Ã¾enne was bicome a monke.

Â»I seyde and onswerde sum tyme to Ã¾e Ãat i schulde neuer glad be, But nou i sey, sikerly, In herte schal i neuer beo soriÂ«. IN Irelond dwelled, sikerly, A bisschop, was called seint Malachi, Ãat seint Bernard louede wel And endyted his lyf eueridel. Whon seint Malachi ded was, Bernard for him song an hei? masâ Of Requiem i trouwe hit were, For a miracle Ã¾at ful Ã¾ere. God schewed to Bernard iwis Ãat Malachi was in blis, And enspired him of an orisoun, To seyn at his post-comoun. Aftur Ã¾e post-comoun was isonge, He chaunged his orisoun wiÃ¾ his tonge Of Requiem Ã¾at he schulde seie, And seide of seint Malachie: Deus qui beatum Maluchiam sanctorum tuorum meritis coequasti, tribue quesumus ut qui preciose mortis eius festa agimus uite quoque imitemur exempla, per Cristum.

Ãe abbot him askede wiÃ¾ wondring: Â»Fadur, what neodeÃ¾ Ã¾e of leornyng? We trouwen Ã¾at of connynge Beo not such anoÃ¾ur lyuyngeÂ«. And he onswerde wiÃ¾ pacience: Â»Heer nis no verrey science, Ne no verrey knowyng Wel neih of no maner Ã¾ing; Aboue of science is al fulnes, Aboue is verrey knowyng of soÃ¾nesÂ«. Whon Ã¾at he him Ã¾us hedde told fore, Ãe abbot of him seih no more. He tok good hede what day Ã¾at was, To wite what wolde falle of Ã¾at cas. And he fond soÃ¾ly atte last At Ã¾at same day seint Bernard fast Out of Ã¾is world to God aboue, Of whom euere he hedde set his loue.

SEint Austin was nempned Ã¾at name For Ã¾reo causus of gret fame: Ãe furst is excellence of dignite, Ãe secunde is feruour of loue &amp; charite, Ãe Ã¾ridde is for Ã¾e kynde interpretacioun Of Ã¾at name of gret renoun. Whi? furst for excellence of dignite, For, riht as Ã¾e emperour Augustus in his mageste Grettur is Ã¾en eny oÃ¾ur kyng, Riht so was Austin in his teching Tofore oÃ¾ur doctours excellent In declaryng holy writtes entent.

Ãe secunde cause is, as I seide aboue, Feruour in charite and loue: For, as Ã¾e moneÃ¾ of August to his meete PasseÃ¾ oÃ¾ure in gret hete, Riht so seint Austyn his herte wiÃ¾inne WiÃ¾ heuenliche loue, forsoÃ¾e, dude brinne.

ÃEn his breÃ¾eren euerichon Tofore him he calde anon And seide: Â»i haue ipreyed vr lord, BoÃ¾e wiÃ¾ Ã¾ouht and wiÃ¾ word, Ãat he schulde of his god wil Delyuere vs of Ã¾is peril OÃ¾ur elles wiÃ¾outen offence ?if vs good pacience Or elles take me Ã¾is lyf fro, Ãat i seo not so muche woÂ«. GOd graunted him Ã¾e Ã¾ridde askyng: For Ã¾e Ã¾ridde moneÃ¾ of Ã¾e beseching Of Ã¾at citÃ©Ã© he fel seek And of Ã¾e feuere to bedde went ek.

Ãe seuen psalmus al on a rowe He let writen vppon a wowe, Ãat, as he in his beodes lay, Miht hem sigge eueriday; He wolde hem seye deuoutliche, Wepe Ã¾erto wel tenderliche, And, for Ã¾at he nolde nou?t be let To don as he his herte hedde set, Ten dayes bifore his dy?ing Ãer moste nomon come in his seoing, But ?if his leche were in ilet OÃ¾ur elles a mon Ã¾at brouht him met.

Whon Austin sauh his feiÃ¾fulnes, He preyed to God of his godnes Ãat his wille were Ã¾at mon to hele. And so he was sone eueridele. He heled mony a sek man And mony a miracle dude he Ã¾an. IN his two and twentiÃ¾e bok De ciuitate dei whose luste lok, He may fynde miracles tweyn Ãat he telleÃ¾, in certein, As Ã¾ei weore anoÃ¾ur monnes doyngâ But God hem wrouht for his preying. In his bok Ã¾us he sayde: Â»At Iponence I wot a mayde Ãat wiÃ¾ oyle enoynted hire had: Ãerfore Ã¾e deuel made hire mad; But a prest for hire wepte sore To God, Ã¾at heo schulde not beo lore: And anon heo dilyuered was Of Ã¾e fend in Ã¾at casÂ«. Â»AlsoÂ«, he seide, Â»i knewh a bisschope Ãat preyed to God wiÃ¾ good hope For a ?ong mon, Ã¾at he not sawe, Whom Ã¾e deuel heold in awe: And anon riht, verreyment, He was saued from Ã¾at cumbrementÂ«.

A child Ã¾er was wiÃ¾ wo bigon: WiÃ¾ Ã¾e seeknesse of Ã¾e ston; Leches putte his frendes in witte Ãat he moste nedes beo kitte. But Ã¾e modur hedde gret drede Leste Ã¾orwh Ã¾at cuttynge he schuld be dede; Ãerfore to seint Austin Ã¾an Deuoutliche preyede Ã¾at womman, WiÃ¾ word and wiÃ¾ herte mylde, Ãat he schulde helpe and hele hir chylde. Anon riht Ã¾enne Ã¾e chyld, iwis, A gret stone al out dude pis And was al hol of Ã¾at seknes, And Ã¾onked God of his goodnes. IN an hous of religious, Ãat men callen Almous, In Ã¾e vigile of seint Austin A monk was rauissched Ã¾erin In spirit and sauh such a cas: Ãat a cloude from heuene sliden doun was, And seint Austin Ã¾eron sittyng In bisschops cloÃ¾ing, him Ã¾hou?te, wel semyng, And his tweyn e?en verreyliche To twei sonne bemus weren liche, Ãat al Ã¾at churche lihted Ã¾o, A wondur gret swetnesse com him fro. SEint Bernard Ã¾orwh Godus miht Was at matins on a niht, Ãer Ã¾e legende good and fyn Was rad of a trete of seint Austin; Ãe while a luytel on slepe he fil, Ãouh hit were not wiÃ¾ his wil, Him Ã¾hou?te he say Ã¾at ilke tym A feir child stondynge beo him, Of whos mouÃ¾ out Ã¾er ran So grete cours of watres Ã¾an Ãat hit semed to him wel Ãat hit fulde Ã¾e chirche eueridel. Whon he awok, he wuste wel afyn Ãat Ã¾at was seint Austin, Ãat wiÃ¾ his goode teching Fulled holichirche wiÃ¾ god lyuyng. A mon Ã¾at louede him hertilike Coueyted of him to haue a relyke: Ãerfore ful deuoutely To a monk Ã¾at kepte Ã¾e bodi He ?af for seint Austines sake, On of his fingres him forto take, A gret summe of good money. Ãe monk Ã¾enne tok al in god fey, But he him Ã¾ou?t sumwhat on gyle: And a ded monnes fynger he rayed Ã¾at while, Wrapped hit in a selkene cloÃ¾, And tok hit Ã¾e mon wiÃ¾outen oÃ¾, He seide: hit was of seint Austyn A fingre and a relyke fyn. Ãe mon hit tok reuerentliche And worschiped hit deuoutliche, WiÃ¾ his e?en and his mouÃ¾, He hit cussed, as Ã¾ing selcouÃ¾. But God tok hede to his feiÃ¾ Ãorwh his miht, as Ã¾e bok seiÃ¾, And a verrei fingre of seynt Austin Him sende of his merci diuin, And Ã¾at oÃ¾ur anon riht Was don awey Ã¾orwh Godus miht.

Ãe monk Ã¾at him bygyled hadde Seide Ã¾at men weren waxen al madde, For he him bigyled on his maner WiÃ¾ a ded monnes fynger. But whon Ã¾e toumbe was vndon, Ãei founden Ã¾at Ã¾er lakked on Of Ã¾e fyngres of his honde. And Ã¾enne Ã¾ei Ã¾onked Godus sonde, And Ã¾e abbot of his offyce Remued Ã¾e monk, Ã¾at was so nyce, And punissched him for Ã¾at doyng Of such a fals begyling. AT Burgoyne in a munster swet, Ãat is icalled Fountanet, Ãer was a monk, god mon and truwe, Ãat men called Ã¾o Daun Huwe, To seint Austin he was deuout, To rede his bokus he was about. He preied seint Austin deuoutlye Ãat, what tyme Ã¾at he schulde dye, Ãat hit scholde falle on his festedayâ Ãus hertiliche he dude him pray. Fiftene dayes tofore Ã¾at solempnite WiÃ¾ brenynge feuere taken was he, And riht vppon seint Austines eue WiÃ¾ al his rihtes and good bileue Vppon Ã¾e grounde he was forÃ¾ leyde, Forte dye, as alle men seide. In Ã¾e chirche an old monk sat, Seyinge his psauter vppon a mat, And sauh a siht of gret delyt: A cumpaygnye, cloÃ¾ed in whit, Entringe wiÃ¾ deuocioun In to Ã¾e churche on a processioun, Beohynde hem alle Ã¾er com a man Al lyk a bisschop icloÃ¾ed Ã¾an. Ãe monk sumdel aferd was, But he asked on of hem Ã¾e cas, What Ã¾ei weren and whodur Ã¾ei went, Whi Ã¾ei come so, to what entent. And anon riht in Ã¾at tym On of hem onswerde him Ãat seint Austin wiÃ¾ his chanouns Was icomen for Ã¾e nones, To fette Ã¾e monkes soule to blis Ãat him tofore hedde serued, iwis.

VPpon a tyme wiÃ¾outen drede Seint Austin vppon a bok gon rede, W(h)il Ã¾at he liuede, wiÃ¾ good entent: He sauh wher a fend wend And a gret bok in his nek Trussed, in Ã¾e maner of a sek. Anon him coniured seint Austyn To schewe him what was writen Ã¾erin. And he seide: Â»sunnes, wiÃ¾outen doute, Ãat I haue gedered of mennes abouteÂ«.

Whon he com to Ã¾e fend a?eyn, Â»Scheuh me Ã¾e placeÂ« he gon seyn, Â»Ãer Ã¾at i was set in Ã¾i boke, Let me seo, red and loke!Â« Ãe fend turnde faste, he couÃ¾e not fynde, He wox al wroÃ¾ as Ã¾e wynde And seide: Â»me forÃ¾inkeÃ¾ i schewed Ã¾e Mi bok, for Ã¾ou hast bigyled me And don awey wiÃ¾ Ã¾i preyere Ãi synne Ã¾at was writen hereÂ«. Ãe fend vanissched Ã¾enne away, Seynt Austin nomore of him saih. A wommon dwelled sum men among Sumtyme, Ã¾at dude hire muche wrong, And Ã¾en heo went to seint Austin To place Ã¾er he sat in, Forte aske counseil of him What hire weore best do for Ã¾at tym. Heo fond him studying bisiliche, And heo saluwed him reuerentliche, But he biheold on hire noÃ¾ing Ne onswerd nouht to hire seying. Ãe wommon gan in hire hert caste Ãat Ã¾e holy mon was so studefaste Ãat he nolde not in no cas Biholde a wommon in Ã¾e fas; Ãerfore heo neihhed him ner, Tolde him Ã¾e cas of hire daunger. But he tornd him nou?t to hire Ne ?af hire non onswere, And heo Ã¾erfore wiÃ¾ sori cher Wente hir hom in heuy maner. Afturward what more and lesse On a day seint Austyn wente to messe; Ãis wommon stod Ã¾ere and herde hit, And was rauissched in hire spirit Aftur Ã¾e sacringe in verite Tofore Ã¾e he?e trinite: Ãer heo sauh wiÃ¾outen dred Seint Austin, enclyning wiÃ¾ his hed, As bisi as he mihte beo, iwis, Disputyng of Ã¾e grete blis Of Ã¾at blisful triniteâ God ?if vs grace Ã¾at siht to se!â A vois to hire seide cler and fyn: Â»Whon Ã¾ou were at seint Austyn, He was so ifulled of charite, To dispute of Ã¾e blis of Ã¾e trinite, Ãat of Ã¾e tok he non hede, NouÃ¾ur to counseil no to rede.

As heo was beden, so dude heo, And good counseil Ã¾en ?af hire he. SUm tyme a mon Ã¾er was Ãat bifel such a cas: Ãat rauissched was in his spirit In to blis wiÃ¾ gret dilyt: Ãer he sauh angeles monye And oÃ¾ur seintes in gret glorie, But, for seint Austin he sauh nouht, He wondrede gretliche in his Ã¾ouht. He asked Ã¾en on of hem Wher seint Austin mihte ben. And he seide: he was an heih, As a wys clerk and a sleih Disputyng in diuinite Of Ã¾e heinesse of Ã¾e trinite. ALso sum tyme men of Papye Weren itake for envye Of Ã¾e marchiun of Malaspyn And in a prison put strong wiÃ¾in; For couetyse of heore moneye Ãei forbed vppon al weye Ãat men schulde ?iue hem no drinke, NouÃ¾our swet ne sour, in hem to sinke. Ãerfore summe di?ed Ã¾er in And summe dronken heore oune vrin. Amongus hem was a ?ong felawe Ãat of seint Austin stod gret awe And worschiped him hedde ofte tym: Ãerfore he preyed he schulde helpe him. Ãe nexte niht at hei? midniht Austin apeered to him ful riht And lad him bi Ã¾e riht hond ForÃ¾ wiÃ¾ him vppon druy?e lond, Til he com to Ã¾e flod of Grauelâ Ãat mony a mon knoweÃ¾ riht wel; Ãer Austin dupped a leef of a vyn In Ã¾at flod wel ofte Ã¾erin, ÃerwiÃ¾ his tonge he moysted Ã¾an: Ãerof was he a wel fayn man, He Ã¾hou?te him so at ese, verreyment, Ãat he tok non hede of pyement. A prouost of a chirche collegial Loued seint Austin wiÃ¾ his herte al. But at a tyme him tok seknes, Ãat Ã¾reo ?er wiÃ¾outen les He kepte his bed as mon beddered, Ãat mihte not sture out of Ã¾e sted. Tyme of ?eer com Ã¾en, parde, Of seint Austines day Ã¾e solempnete.

A schepherde bitwenen his scholdres twein A gret bocche hedde and a uylein, Ã¾at him dude so muche wo Ãat his mihtes were neih ago. But to seint Austin he preyed fast To sende him hele, atte last. Seint Austin in a uisioun Apered to him in his deuocioun And leide his hond vppon Ã¾e sore: And hit was hol for euermore. ÃAt same mon afturward Ã¾o Lost Ã¾e siht of his e?en two. To seint Austin his herte he lende And preyed, his siht him forte sende. Vppon a day aftur Ã¾e meridien Austin apeered to him Ã¾en And wiped his e?en wiÃ¾ his honde: And he was hol Ã¾orwh Godus sonde.

Of his furste wyf he gat a childe And called him Sauyn, god and mylde, Of his secunde wyf also A feir douhtur he gat Ã¾o And called hire rihte name Sauyna, wommon of gode fame. Sauyn Ã¾e ?onge rad on a boke On a tyme as he gon loke, Ãis vers, wiÃ¾outen mor: Asperges me domine &amp; mundabor. What was Ã¾erof Ã¾e vndurstondyng, CouÃ¾e he not wite for noÃ¾ing. In to his chaumbre he wente him Ã¾ere, Leide him in askes and in an here, And seide he hedde leuer dye Ã¾en But he mihte wite what Ã¾at was to men. An angel seide to him Ã¾is red: Â»Trouble not Ã¾i self riht to bi ded, For riht here in Ã¾is place Of God Ã¾ou hast ifounden grace; Whon Ã¾ou art cristned, wite wel nou, Ãou schalt beo whittore Ã¾en is Ã¾e snouh, And Ã¾en scha(l)t Ã¾ou riht wel wite What is to sei Ã¾at Ã¾ou sauh writeÂ«. Whon Ã¾e angel was gon him fro, Idoles and maumetes he forsok Ã¾o And worschiped hemnomore aftur Ã¾at tym. Ãerfore his fader was wroÃ¾ wiÃ¾ him And seide: Â»beter is, wiÃ¾outen drede, Ãat Ã¾ou al one beo dede For Ã¾ou vr godus nult not honoure, Ãen alle we dyen in on vreÂ«. Priueliche fleih he Ã¾an To Ã¾e citÃ©Ã© of Tetrasinan. Whon he com to Ã¾e watur of Secan, Ãer preyed he God, as a good man, Ãat cristendom he wolde him sende. And so hit was, er he Ã¾eonne wende.

So Ã¾at for Ã¾at miracle Ã¾o A Ã¾ousund an hundred and ei?te Ã¾erto Men bileeued in vr lord And worschuped him wiÃ¾ herte and word. Whon Ã¾e emperour Aurelean Herde of such a maner man, Ãider he sente mony knihtes Him to take and bringe forÃ¾ rihtes. Whon Ã¾ei comen to Ã¾e watur syde, Ãei founden him preyinge in Ã¾at tyde; Ãei weren aferd him to lette, But, whon he ros, Ã¾ei him grette And seiden: Â»sire, wite Ã¾ou parde, Ãe emperour desyreÃ¾ to seo Ã¾e.

On of Ã¾at same arwes wiÃ¾outen ly?e Hutte Ã¾e emperour in Ã¾e e?e. And for he hedde lost his e?e-siht, He comaundede him to prisun anon riht, And he bad also wiÃ¾ sorwe Ãei schulde gurde of his hed amorwe. Sauinian preied God in Ã¾at cas Ãat he moste come to Ã¾at plas Ãer he was cristned for Godus sake: Anon his veteres al to-brake, And among Ã¾e knihtes euerichon To Ã¾at flod he wente anon. Ãe emperour herde of Ã¾is cast And bad men schulde pursuwe him fast, His hed Ã¾er of to smyteâ For Ã¾at was his most delyte. Whon Sauinian sauh ful riht Ãat Ã¾er suwed him mony a kniht, Vppon Ã¾e watur he wente anon, As Ã¾eih he on eorÃ¾e hedde igon, Til Ã¾at he com to Ã¾at same plas Ãer Ã¾at he icristened was. Ã¾e knihtes waded in ful fast And come to him atte last; Ãei weren aferd him forte smite, He bad hem not spare for no despite, Â»And whon Ã¾at ?e haue so idon, TakeÃ¾ my blod wiÃ¾ ou anon And to Ã¾e emperour ful riht BereÃ¾ hit, Ã¾at he mowe haue his siht, Ãat he mowe knowe euer afturward Godus vertue, Ã¾at is vr lord!Â« Whon his hed was of ismite, In his oune hondes he tok hite And Ã¾orwh Godus grete graas Bar hit nine and fourti paas.

Â»Nay, dame, quaÃ¾ heo, wiÃ¾oute doute, Whateuer Ã¾ou wolt, do Ã¾i wille, So Ã¾ou Ã¾i self nouÃ¾ur sle ne spilleÂ«. Vppon Ã¾e morwe whon hit was day, BoÃ¾e two Ã¾ei wenten heore way. Hire fadur hir souhte in eueri plasâ No mon couÃ¾e wite wher Ã¾at heo was.

Ãen al Ã¾at wike Ã¾ei faste and prayden; But Ã¾ei herde noÃ¾ing of Ã¾at mayden, As Ã¾ei weore wont bifore to heere Whon Ã¾ei to god made heore preyere; For Eufrosyne preyde so day and niht Ãat god schulde not outen hire to nowiht: Ãerfore to Ã¾e abbot verrament God wolde not hire schewe, ne to Ã¾e couent. ÃE abbot to Patnucius Ã¾enne he sayd: Â»Of godes sonde holt Ã¾e apayd, And keep his lore in alle wyse, For whom he loueÃ¾, he wol chastise.

ÃEn Eufrosyne wuste wel anon Hire tyme was come Ã¾at heo schulde gon; To hire heo called Pathnucius And speek to him and seide Ã¾us: Â»Almihti god of his goodnes HaÃ¾ disposet for my wrecchednes, Ãat Ã¾orw his vertu and his miht Mi desyr to an ende is fully diht, And, for Ichaue bore me so monliche, I schal haue a croune in heuene-riche.
