There was a caue ioynynge vnto the place Whiche was out of m?nes remembra?ce past For it was not vsed of longe space On the toppe therof in lyght for to cast There was an hole whiche wos so olde and wast That thornes and breres dyd it ouer growe So that the entre therof none myght knowe And from the caue there was a secrete way Whiche of no creature was espyed Unto the chambre where as Sygysmonde lay The way therof so longe was dysused The dore of the sayd caue was fast barred Whiche passage was stopped so secretly That harde it was the entrynge to espye Sygysmonde by the secrete introduccyon Of loue from whose eyes nothynge can be hyd Of the sayd caue she founde the entrynge soone And in to it alone she descended Bothe length and depnesse she well regarded And to Guystarde she made therof reporte By wrytynge how he myght to her resorte Guystarde of this beynge aduertysed Ordred all thynge mete to his besynesse A ledder cote for hym he deuysed From thornes and breres to kepe hym harmelesse And in the nyght thyder he dyd hym dresse And by a rope in to the caue dyd slyde And there for her all nyght he dyd abyde In the mornynge whan the day gan to appere Sygysmonde caused to auoyde by a trayne The maydes whiche lay within her chambere Sayenge that nyght she coude not slepe for payne And quyetly than to rest she wolde fayne And after them she locked fast the dore Of her purpose she thought she wolde be sure In to the caue she gothe incontynent Fyndynge Guystarde / she oft dyd hym embrace In to her chambre they bothe after went And vnto bedde they yede for theyr solace Theyr pleasaunt lyfe they contynue a space Enforsynge them selfe to please eche other Tyll it was tyme for them to dysseuer Guystarde in to the caue went secretly After whome she locked the dore full fast And to her maydens she went hastely But he durst not whyle the day dyd last Go from the caue but whan mydnyght was past He went out so that none hym espyed And vnto his house fast he hym hyed Often tymes this custome they vsed Theyr lyfe amorous ledynge couertly Of a longe tyme it was not perceyued But fortune whiche is alway contrary By his harde chaunce these louers dyd dyscry So that with sorowe ended theyr pleasure There is no ioye that alway may endure Tancrede alone vsed customably Unto his doughters chambre to resort And on her bedde to slepe somtyme wolde ly Or els with her to fynde some game and sporte In her talkynge he had full greate confort And whan he had ben there a certayne space He wolde departe vnto some other place He came vnto her chambre on a day Whyle she was with her maydens in the gardyne He seynge that she was besy in play Besyde her bedde he dyd hym selfe declyne Afore his face he dyd drawe the curtyne A soft pylowe vnder his heed he cast His were body fell a slepe full fast Sygysmonde before her chambre wyndowes shyt For with Guystarde she had made apoyntment The same day to haue a mery fyt And whan she thought her tyme conuenyent Out of the gardyne secretly she went And vnto her chambre she resorted And after her the dore she fast locked She not knowynge her father there a slepe The caue dore she opened with her kay And caused Guystarde out of it to crepe And on the bedde as they were wont alway Of Uenus they vsed the sporte and play So that by noyse and wordes that they dyd make Tancrede her father out of his slepe dyd wake Tancrede from his slepe moued sodeynly All theyr pastyme he well aduertysed At the fyrst tyme he dyd thynke for to crye But in hym selfe he well delybered By sylence his mynde sholde be better sped And that he myght with delyberacyon Upon them bothe take iust correccyon Where from noyse he kept hym selfe full close These louers whan they had done theyr pleasure With glad semblaunt they bothe from y? bedde rose The dede they thought ryght secrete and sure In to the caue whiche was depe and obscure Guystarde went in as he was wont to do And Sygysmonde dyd to her maydens go R.

Tancrede for this chaunce beynge troubled From the chambre secretly dyd yssue And with watche men the caue he enclosed Within the nyght Guystarde for to pursue As he came oute they toke this louer true In his ledder cote as he was clothed Before Tancrede they haue hym presented Tancrede vnto hym spake thus cruelly Guystarde my kyndnesse hath not deserued That thou sholde do to me this vylany Whiche with myne eyen this day I espyed I haue alwaye the greatly fauoured Thou hast dyshonoured me by thyne offence For kyndnesse shame thou doest me recompence The true louer answered pyteously Unto Tancrede sayenge syr for certayne The harde chaunce of loue no man can deny It is greater than is the power humayne From it I coude my selfe in no wyse refrayne Your puyssaunce may not vnto loue compare Loue is so greate that it wyll no man spare This prynce for this beynge full of sorowe Commaunded hym to be kept in prysone And after dyner on the nexte morowe Unto his doughters chambre he went ryght soone All were auoyded saue they two alone With heuy chere thus vnto her he sayd Whiche knewe nothynge her councell was bewrayd Sygysmonde I haue ben longe dysceyued By your honest vertu and sadde prudence Whiche vnto me so stedfast appered That in you I had so greate confydence Thynkynge ye wolde neuer do suche offence No man coude haue made me it to byleue Yf with myne eyes the dede I dyd not preue Thy heynous trespace doth my herte sore greue Whiche contynually is in my thought That the small tyme whiche I haue to leue In sorowe to ende thou hast it now brought At leest yf thou had mynded to be nought Thou sholde haue taken one to thy degre Conuenyent the lesse the faute had be But of the multytude that vse my hall Thou hast chosen Guystarde thy loue to be Whiche is moost symple and poorest of them all Not gentyll borne but come of lowe degre Whome we haue nourysshed for charyte Wherfore I am so wrapped in sorowe That what to do as yet I do not knowe Of Guystarde whiche is in captyuyte What I wyll do I am delybered But what punysshement I shall take on the As yet my mynde is not determyned Loue wolde the offence to be pardoned The trespace requyreth vengeaunce certayne Iustyce wolde punysshe / nature wolde refrayne Therfore my mynde as yet is varyable Not knowynge what to do ne what counceyll Sholde to this mater be moost profytable But I thought fyrst to knowe thy mynde and wyll And vpon that my pleasure to fulfyll These wordes sayd / he cast asyde his eye And lyke a chylde he wept haboundauntly Sygysmonde herynge her father thus speke And how Guystarde was put in pryson depe For sorowe her herte in two dyd nyghe breke Unneth from sownynge she coude her selfe kepe But lamentably she full fast dyd wepe Knowynge theyr loue to be dyscouered Whiche of longe tyme had be full closely hyd She vaynquysshynge her femynyne courage With constant mynde she dyd cease to lament For angre she knyt the browes and vysage And for to dye in herte she dyd assent Yf Guystarde dyed by her faders Iudgement Wherfore of dethe she beynge not dysmayd Unto her father these wordes she sayd Father your mercy I wyll not requyre Syth your mynde is my louer for to kyll I shall nothynge optayne of my desyre And as for me it shall be at your wyll Whyder that ye wyll my lyfe [t]o saue or spyll The one I knowe well I shall neuer get The other to haue I do not couet Wherfore your mercy I do now despyse And with good reason for to purge my fame Of this my dede lette it you now suffyse That ye your selfe of it are moost to blame For I had neuer come vnto this shame Yf it had not ben by your neclygence Syth I dyd yll / it is but your offence To loue Guystarde I knowlege and confesse And euer shall whyle that my lyfe doth last Whiche is but short the trewthe for to expresse My herte and wyll shall euer be stedfast Yf loue may be whan that the lyfe is past Hym for to loue / my herte shall neuer sease But and it may / it shall rather encrease Father ye sholde haue well consydred That I am not made of yron nor stone But of your flesshe and nature engendred And though that by age your courage is gone Of youthe ye sholde haue consyderacyon How they be brent with ryght feruent desyre Of loue whiche doth theyr hertes sore set on fyre Forthermore ye myght ryght well consyder That ydelnesse and delycate fedynge In yonge people to lust is a breder And
