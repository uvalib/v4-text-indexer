      <field name="fulltext">The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored To the right Vertuous, Beauteous, and accomplished Gentlewomen, Mistris Mary Holder, daughter to the worshipfull Cle: Holder Prebend Residenciary of the Collegiat Church of Southwell. And Mistris Sara Hart, daughter to the worshipfull Iohn Hart of London Esquire. I. [Open the dore, Whose there within?] Open the dore, Whose there within? The fairest of thy Mothers kin, O come, come, come abroad, And heere the shrill birds sing, The Ayre with tunes that loade, It is too soone to goe to rest, The Sun not midway yet to West, The day doth misse thee, And will not part vntill it kisse thee. Were I as faire as you pretend, Yet to an vnknowne sild-seene friend I dare not ope the dore. To heare the sweet birds sing, Oft proues a dangerous thing. The Sun may run his wonted race, And yet not gaze on my poore face, The day may misse mee: Therefore depart, You shall not kisse me. II. [Resolu'd to loue, vnworthy to obtaine] [1] Resolu'd to loue, vnworthy to obtaine, I doe no fauour craue, but humble wise, To thee my sighes in verse I sacrifice, Onely some pity and no helpe to gaine. 2 Much sorrow in itselfe my loue doth moue, More my dispaire to loue a hopelesse blisse: My folly most to loue when sure to misse, Oh helpe me but this last griefe to remoue. 3 All paine if you command it, ioy shall proue, And wisedome to seeke ioy: then say but this, Because my pleasure in thy torment is, I doe command thee without hope to loue. III. [Ah were she pittifull, as she is faire] Ah were she pittifull, as she is faire, Or but so milde as she is seeming so, Then were my hopes greater then my dispaire, Then all the world were heauen, and nothing woe. But beauty being pittilesse and sterne, Cruell in deede, though milde in outward show: Will neither hopes, or my dispaires discerne, But leades me to a hell of endlesse woe. IIII. [Disdaine that so doth fill me] [1] Disdaine that so doth fill me, Hath surely sworne to kill me, And I must dye, Desire that still doth burne me, To life againe will turne me, And liue must I, O kill me then dispaire, That I may liue againe. 2 Thy lookes are life vnto me, And yet those lookes vndoe me: O death and life. Thy smile some rest doth show me, Thy frowne with warre orethrow me, O peace and strife. Nor life, nor death is either, Then giue me both, or neither. 3 Life onely cannot please me, Death onely cannot ease mee: Change is delight. I liue that death may kill me, I dye that life may fill me, Both day and night. If once dispaire decay, Desire will weare away. V. [O pretious time] O pretious time, Created by the might of his blest word, That made all comely features, And wisely parted into day and night, For the best vse and seruice of the Creatures, O woe is me that haue mispent this treasure, In vaine delight, and fond and wicked pleasure. VI. [Can a Mayde that is well bred] Can a Mayde that is well bred, Hath a blush so louely red, Modest lookes, wise, milde, discreet, And a nature passing sweet, Breake her promise, vntrue proue, On a sodaine change her loue, Or be wonne ere to neglect, Him to whom she vow'd respect? Such a Maide alas I know, Oh that weedes mongst Corne should grow: Or a Rose should prickles haue, Wounding where she ought to saue. I that did her parts extoll, Will my lauish tongue controll: Outward parts doe blinde the eyes, Gall in golden pills oft lyes. Reason, wake and sleepe no more, Land vpon some safer shoare: Thinke on her and be afraide, Of a faithlesse fickle Maide. Of a faithlesse fickle Maide, Thus true loue is still betraide: Yet it is some ease to sing, That a Maide is light of wing. VII. [O I doe loue, then kisse me] O I doe loue, then kisse me, And after Ile not misse thee, With bodies louely meeting: To dally pretty sweeting. Though I am some what aged, Yet is not loue asswaged, But with sweet ardent clips, Ile lay thee on the lips. And make thee euer sweare, Fare-well old Batcheler. VIII. [Since iust disdaine began to rise] Since iust disdaine began to rise, and cry reuenge for spitefull wrong, What erst I prays'd, I now dispise, &amp; thinke my loue was all too long, I tread in durt that scornefull pride, which in thy lookes I haue discry'd, Thy beauty is a painted skin, for fooles to see their faces in. Thine eyes that some as starres esteeme, From whence themselues they say take light: Like to the foolish fire I deeme, That leades men to their death by night. Thy words and oathes are light as winde, And yet farre lighter is thy minde: Thy friendship is a broken reede, That failes thy friend in greatest neede. IX. [At her faire hands, how haue I grace intreated] At her faire hands, how haue I grace intreated, With prayers oft repeated, Yet stil my loue is thwarted, Heart let her goe, let her goe, let her goe, for shee'le not be conuerted, Say shall she goe, O no, no, no, no, She is most faire though she be marble hearted. How often haue my sighes declar'd mine anguish, Wherein I daily languish? Yet doth she still procure it, Harke, let her goe for I cannot endure it: Say, shall she goe, Oh no, no, no, no, She gaue the wound, and she alone must cure it. X. [Now Robin laugh and sing] Now Robin laugh and sing, thy Masters sheepe-sheering, When Pyes and Custards smoake, then Robin plyes his poake, And plaies the merry Cater, My teeth doth run a water, And when the Bagpipes play for this the merry day, Then comes in little Ioane, And bids strike vp the droane. And while the droane doth play, Vpon this merry day: The Country Lasses throng, With Timbrels to their song, In praise of lusty Robin, The Townes chiefe iolly Robin. Who footes it ore the Downes, Not caring for such Clownes As scorne his little Ioane. Then strike vp still the droane. XI. [Hey the horne, the horna] Hey the horne, the horna to Vulcan doth belong, And Venus, for she gaue it, is Mistrisse of my song, If Vulcan should not haue it, then Vulcan should haue wrong. The horne, the horne, the horna, The horne, the horne the horna. If Vulcan haue the horna, then Venus is to blame: And Mars that did entice her, vnto that wanton game. Yet Vulcan needs must keepe it, to set all well in frame: The horne, the horne, the horna. The horne, the horne, the horna. XII. [Vpon my lap my Soueraigne sits] Vpon my lap my Soueraigne sits, and sucks vpon my Brest, Meane time his Loue mayntaines my life, and giues my sense her rest, Sing lullaby, my little Boye, Sing lullaby, mine onely Ioy. When thou hast taken thy repast, Repose (my Babe) on me: So may thy Mother and thy nurse, Thy Cradle also be. Sing lullaby my little Boy, Sing lullaby mine onely ioy. I grieue that duty doth not worke All what my wishing would: Because I would not be to thee, But in the best I should. Sing lullaby, Yet as I am, and as I may, I must and will be thine: Though all too little for thy selfe, Vouchsafing to be mine. Sing lullaby my little Boy, Sing lullaby mine onely Ioy. XIII. [Locke vp faire lids the treasure of my heart] Locke vp faire lids the treasure of my heart, Preserue those beames, this ages onely light, To her sweet sence, sweet sleepe, some ease impart, Her sence too weake to beare her spirits might. And while, O sleepe, thou closest vp her sight, Her light, where loue did forge his fairest dart: O harbour all her parts in easefull plight, Let no strange dreame make her faire body start. But yet, O dreame, if thou wilt not depart, In this rare subiect from thy common right: But wilt thy selfe in such a seat delight, Then take my shape and play a Louers part: Kisse her from me, and say vnto her sprite, Till her eyes shine, I liue in darkest night. XIIII [Loue her no more] Loue her no more, Her selfe she doth not loue: Shame and the blackest clouds of night, Hide her for euer from thy sight. O day why doe thy beames in her eyes mooue? Fly her deere honor'd friend, doe so, Sheele be the cause of much, much woe, Alas she will vndoe thee: Her loue is fatall to thee. Curse her then and goe. [XV. Come pretty wag and sing] Come pretty wag and sing Come pretty wag and sing, The suns all ripening wing, fans vp the wanton spring, O let vs both, let's both goe chant it, O let vs both, et's both goe chant it, O how fresh May doth flant it, O how fresh May doth flant it. [XVI. Then with reports most sprightly] Then with reports most sprightly Then with reports most sprightly, Trip with thy voice most lightly, O sing. O sing so wittely, for now, for now the Cuckoo sings, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, that eccho, that eccho, that eccho doth rebound, And dally with the sound, and dally with the sound, and eccho doth rebound, dally with the sound, and dally, dally with the sound. [XVII. Pretty wantons sweetly sing] Pretty wantons sweetly sing Pretty wantons sweetly sing, In honour of the smiling spring, But O, But O, Hark, Hark, Hark, how the birds sing, O mark that note, O mark that note, Iug, Iug, Iug, Terew terew, terew, terew, terew, terew, terew, O pretly warbled from a sweet, sweet throate, from a sweet throat, O pretly warbled from a sweet throat, from a sweet throat, from a sweet, from a sweet sweet throat. [XVIII. Sing loue is blinde] Sing loue is blinde Sing loue is blinde, so now is lou's Lady Lou's a good Clarke, reads perfitly, perfitly, &amp; puts together, Then tel me then tell me, to hit the marke Cupid wants eyes, and is a baby, O no, O no, O no, yet he can make the strongest fall, With a hey nony, nony, with a hey nony, nony, with a hey nony, nony, nony, nony, nony no, hey nony, nony no. [XIX. What neede the morning rise] What neede the morning rise What neede the morning rise, seeing a Sun in both thine eyes? O tis on thee to gaze, Strike them into a maze by thy more golden rayes, Let no eye dare to see, how thus I challenge thee, O let no hate, our white hands seuer, neuer, neuer, neuer, neuer. [XX. Gaze not on youth] Gaze not on youth, let age containe thy wandring eye Gaze not on youth, let age containe thy wandring eye, thy wandring eye, thy eye from obiects vaine, But when the eye, but when the eye is on the face, The minde is in another place, the minde is in, is in, another place, in another place. [XXI. True pleasure is in Chastitie] True pleasure is in Chastitie True pleasure is in Chastitie, No learne of me, and sing this still, She onely, she, she, she onely, she, she euer is chast, That is with euery looke, That is with euery looke, looke outfac't, that is with euery looke outfac't. [XXII. The Spring of ioy is dry] The Spring of ioy is dry, that ran into my heart The Spring of ioy is dry, that ran into my heart, And all my comforts flye, my loue and I, I must part, I must part, I must part, Farewell my loue, I goe, The Bee vnto the flower, The Cattle to the brook, That we, that we may sport our fill, may sport our fill, And loue continue still, and loue continue still. [XXIII. Is not that my fancies Queene] Is not that my fancies Queene, in the brightnesse of her rayes Is not that my fancies Queene, in the brightnesse of her rayes, Passing Summers cheerest dayes? That comes tripping, tripping, tripping, comes tripping, tripping, tripping, that comes tripping ore the Greene? It is my Loue, tis my loue, tis my loue, it is my loue, And thus, and thus we meete, And thus, and thus we greete, Happier then the Gods aboue, the Gods aboue, Meeting may wee loue for euer, Euer loue, euer loue, euer loue, and neuer, neuer seuer, and neuer, neuer seuer, and neuer, neuer, neuer seuer. [XXIIII. See, O see, who is heere come a maying] This Song was made for the King and Queenes entertaynement at High-gate on May-day. 1604. See, see, see, see, see, see, see, O see, who is heere come a maying See, see, see, see, see, see, see, O see, who is heere come a maying, Why left we off our playing? On them that Gods as men amaze? Vp Nightingale and sing, Iug, Iug, Iug, Iug, Iug, Iug, All birds, all birds their Musick bring, Record from euery bush; Whose like was neuer seene for good and faire, Nor can be though fresh May should euery day, should euery day inuite a seuerall paire, inuite a seuerall seuerall paire, inuite, inuite a seuerall paire.
