      <field name="fulltext">LURES IMMORTAL Sadly, apparently frustrate, life hangs above us, Cruel, dark, unexplained; Yet still the immortal through mortal incessantly pierces With calls, with appeals, and with lures. Lure of the sinking sun, into undreamed islands, Fortunate, far in the West; Lure of the star, with speechless news o'er-brimming, With language of darted light; Of the sea-glory of opening lids of Aurora, Ushering eyes of the dawn; Of the callow bird in the matin darkness calling, Chorus of drowsy charm; Of the wind, south-west, with whispering leaves illumined, Solemn gold of the woods; Of the intimate breeze of noon, deep-charged with a message, How near, at times, unto speech! Of the sea, that soul of a poet a-yearn for expression, For ever yearning in vain! Hoarse o'er the shingle with loud, unuttered meanings, Hurling on caverns his heart. Of the summer night, what to communicate, eager? Perchance the secret of peace. The lure of the silver to gold, of the pale unto colour, Of the seen to the real unseen; Of voices away to the voiceless, of sound unto silence, Of words to a wordless calm; Of music, doomed unto wandering, still returning Ever to heaven and home. The lure of the beautiful woman through flesh unto spirit, Through a smile unto endless light; Of the flight of a bird thro' evening over the marsh-land, Lingering in heaven alone; Of the vessel disappearing over the sea-marge, With him or with her that we love; Of the sudden touch in the hand of a friend or a maiden, Thrilling up to the stars. The appealing death of a soldier, the moon just rising, Kindling the battlefield; Of the cup of water, refused by the thirsting Sidney, Parched with the final pang: Of the crucified Christ, yet lo, those arms extended, Wide, as a world to embrace; And last, and grandest, the lure, the invitation, And sacred wooing of Death; Unto what regions, or heavens, or solemn spaces, Who, but by dying, can tell? LIKE TO A MORTAL BARQUE Like to a mortal barque, Touching a fairy shore; Half wondering, half in dread, I fear to know thee more. Safer the open sea, Kinder large sunshine, Than island perilous On the green sea-line. DISILLUSIONED Doth Viola seem so cold? Yet virgin she Disclosed unto the evening her full soul, Telling her tale unto the violets, Her history to the lilies, while the sun Of passion glimmered to a gloomy west. Thinking to clasp a God her arms enwrapped Merely a solemn statue without life, Faultless, approved, a stiff unmeaning form, That which he seemed, dreaming she made him seem. The dream is dead, the hollow form remains. Frail-flaming June, to what a bareness fallen! None now can matter, after him she found So little, whom she cherished as so great. One leap her being made, and missed the leap, Now must she crawl her way for evermore. APRIL O brief and swift and sweet, April appears, Fickle, and shy, and fleet, Laughing through tears. Fitful and all afret, With shower and gleam, Magical mischief, yet Greenly adream. For she, so frailly fair, Shall bring to pass Pomps of the purple air, Glory of grass. Surely the elf shall yield With moody moon, Gold of the mellow field, Riches of noon. E'en as a girl unsure, With hair unbound, Yet may a poet lure To song profound. And, though she may not reap, But passeth by, She shall array the deep Rose of July. BEAUTIFUL LIE THE DEAD Beautiful lie the dead; Clear comes each feature; Satisfied not to be, Strangely contented. Like ships, the anchor dropped, Furled every sail is; Mirrored with all their masts In a deep water. TEARS Sad is the crystal tear From eyes of youth, Sadder the slower drops Of married ruth. Sad tears of maid or wife, Brimming to fall; Often the tearless eye Saddest of all. THE RETURN Slow falls the sun, with slowly failing birds, And a breeze of night! Silent and returning herds Through lingering light! Sated with seas, with stark and foreign towns, Green grass again! I stride once more the spreading downs, Then find the lane. The tree, the brook and the wild garden, all Have kept their place; The sigh, the ripple I recall, But fled thy face! BE THEN YOUR LIFE Be then your life as a swan that calmly glideth On a full river! Mine as the bird storm-tost In cloud for ever. Yet the calm for a hell without colour shall smoothly prepare thee, Sealing thy spirit; But tempest and heaven shall I Wildly inherit. CHILD SADNESS I Child of a life so soft, Laughter and sleep, Why grow thine eyes so oft Solemn and deep? II What of the gathering snow, Winters that weary us? Sprite, dost thou lightly know, Momently serious. III What amid all thy joys Shadow of sorrow? What amid all those toys, Fear of to-morrow? IV Flitting in pink or white Over the lawn, Feelst thou a chill of night Coming on dawn? V Or did the fairies tell Thee in a dream, What we have learned too well, Gloom after gleam? VI Came they through heavy dews Under red skies, Bringing thee silent news, Making thee wise? VII Grief never came to thee Through earthly portal, Yet in thine eyes I see Sadness immortal. AH, WHEN? I came at eve on a sunset field unknown to me, Unknown and yet known. Here did I run as a boy, or loitered a lover, Ah, when? I came at dawn on a river, visited never, Strange, yet unstrange, For I could follow faithful the wind of that river Away to sea. I was driven late in the night to the house of a stranger, Never that house had I seen; Though I never slept in it, yet could I tell each room of it, I knew my way. At times a lonely face from a crowd looks out at me, Startling me, wherefore? That sudden, flitting face I remember dimly, Dimly familiar. They played me music at midnight, never yet heard by me; Unheard, yet heard, Ah, when? TO MURIEL, SINGING I High the soprano goes, Shrill to the noon, Yet thy contralto Makes for the moon. II Though in that earthly voice Melody clear, In thy unearthly song, Music more dear. III Though she so plainly sings Moving the crowd; Thou dost a meaning bring, Low, but not loud. IV All we have wished to say Though but in dream; Dawn and the midnight come From thee astream. V Some may, no doubt, delight In clearer sound, Yet in thy note have I More meaning found. VI Wail for a world gone by, Battle and prayer. Who should express but thou, Deeply aware? AN OCTOBER DAY Through dry and hurrying leaves Golden our way; Sound of the wind, south-west From the wild day! Wild all thy loosened hair, Blown in my eyes; Till thou dost seem a part Of autumn skies. Wild from the setting sun Rushes the rain; Ah, be it true or false, Thy kiss again! THE HOSPITAL NURSE (The real tragedy of the wards) Time was, when filled with ministering dew, I like an angel to the bedside flew Of writhing anguish, or insane distress, Of marred and mutilated wretchedness. I might not sleep for some remembered cry, Or upward stare of fixéd agony. My heart beat fast at sorrow not my own, Easily melting at another's moan. Alas, a gradual apathy congeals My blood, my heart, and all that in me feels. Punctual, timed, obedient to the clock, Howe'er the injured on his pillow rock; This very heart within me does but tick, And dead that sympathy that once was quick. Almost I envy now the thrilling throe, Of hope and fear the furious ebb and flow, Which these upon their couches undergo. More tragic is my soft and noiseless tread,— This service from the dying to the dead; This grey acquaintance with fierce suffering, And bosom proof against the sharpest sting, Fearless familiarity with pain; The dreadful victory of pity slain. The touch unerring and the finger sure, Yet all within now stricken beyond cure! WINTER DAWN Stillness and creeping of colour, A flushing of gold and of red; Opening eyes of Aurora, Roused from a crocus bed. Voices of kine from the meadows, Weary of waning night; Birds in a husky chorus, Darkly aware of light. Lamps in the valley appearing, Bright spurts, one after one; A joyous crackle of faggots, And the heavy night is gone. LOVE'S TRANQUILLITY Dearest, our love is not of dark or bright, Or verses murmured in midnight; Nor hath it aid from starlight or the moon, Or music's long and splendid swoon. Not time, nor distance over it have power, No, nor the dead and wingless hour. Though simple and of everyday it seem, It holds the quality of dream. O, it is proof against delay and death, And hath a tranquil morning breath; Is fragrant as the wild and wayside rose That over grass and hedgerow blows. It hath a very real life in the sun, Scatheless and dateless shall it run; Do others call it cold and without life, Since in it is no kind of strife? Ah no, its peace is kindled from white flame, And from the core of fire it came. A WINTER NIGHT Let others laud the summer's languorous light And lucid glow; For me this dim, unruly winter night, Wild winds that blow! Without, uproar and storm upon the pane, Turmoil and cries; The loud lamenting of the hurricane, The sleet that flies! Within, this satisfying silence deep, With no desire; An apathy divine, surpassing sleep, And kindly fire. That outward conflict brings an inward truce Within this breast. The elemental strife doth but induce A deeper rest. DAWN AND LOSS I lack thee in the noonday light, I want thee in the deep of night, But most, when sadder than all words, I hear the voice of waking birds. Then seem I most of all forlorn, When the grey hour is crudely born. There is no mercy in that ray, On hopeless fancies comes the day. Then is the hollow world remade, God! But the image will not fade! That ghostly chorus from the leaves! Reminds and yet again bereaves! The widowing beam upon me falls, And to a grey remembrance calls; Re-builded is the massy loss, And re-erected is the cross. For in that dimness we had speech Simple and prudent, each to each; Slow on my shoulder fell thy head, I held thee close as skies grew red. O dear wert thou in silent dew! Thrice dear in deepening of the blue! But now I see from this dark room Only the glimmer of a tomb. THE SMILE OF DANTE Whence dost thou wear that smile, grim Florentine, That somewhat softens a too tense distress, Giving a gentleness to each harsh line, And something of more human wistfulness? Was it when thou didst hear behind thee said: “Lo, there the man who goeth down to hell; “And holds a solemn converse with the dead, “Whence earthward comes he all the world to tell.” Why doth that softness on thy lips abide, And tenderness about thy mouth remain? Is it some sweetness caught from her that died And whom thou wast allowed to see again? Still thou dost smile in answer to her smile, Given to sustain thee through this world awhile? BEATRICE CENCI Who stealeth down the turret-stair In raiment white with streaming hair? The moon is hid, the stars are pale, The night-wind hath forgot to wail. Like to a priestess seemeth she Addressed to some dread ministry. What solemn sacrifice or rite Comes she to celebrate this night? A deed of Hell, and yet of Heaven, Into these slender hands is given; Blood must she spill, but evil blood, As evil as hath ever flowed. Now enters she the moonlit room, She sees a bed bright in the gloom; Whereon an old man slumbers deep; Ah, God, how well the wicked sleep! But a faint breathing all she hears, As silently the couch she nears. Now the bright dagger at her breast She plucks from out her maiden vest. Why hesitates she? and a space Uncertain stands above that face? Is it some memory of youth, That brings upon her heart this ruth? Some far-off picture that she sees, When she was dandled on his knees? Is it the hair, so utter white, Hair that should seem a holy sight? Then the red shame leaps to her heart, And furious thoughts again upstart. O'er him she leans; no eyelid he Stirs as tho' warned of destiny. What cry was that? A single cry, That pierced the palace to the sky? And then came down a silence deep, Yet had each sleeper leapt from sleep, And wandering lights and hurrying feet, Hither and thither shadows fleet. But she in silence pure and clean Passed to her chamber all unseen. SHAKESPEARE I Others have pictured thee as mild and bland, And of a cloudless boundless human view; Of calm regard and of composure grand, To whom was nothing strange, and nothing new. Not thus do I conceive thee; but as one That bitterly exclaimed on human doom, And as a spirit sad beneath the sun, And dreading a worse thing beyond the tomb. Man but “an angry ape” appeared; who fed With torment laughter of the gods on high; Lear on the heath, Othello by the bed Awakened but the mockery of the sky. And ah! in this dark welter of the soul No guide art thou and urgest to no goal. II O true that thou couldst warble pastoral bliss, Of forest and green field and fairy land, Since to thy boundless reach nought came amiss, Thou to the nearest task didst set thy hand. And yet thy deepest hour was vast despair, And the true mood of thee was dark and fell; Then heaven with human lightning didst thou bare, Thy thunder echoed in the pools of hell. A sunny smiler all with God at rest, This would they have thee for thy lighter strain. To me a rebel dost thou stand confest, With mighty mutiny of heart and brain; And in no vale of Arden thy renown, But accusation of the heavens thy crown. KEATS Lament is made that thou wast all too young, When Death to silence carried thee away, With brain ungleaned, and many songs unsung, Giving the promise of so fair a day. But I have seen more glory in sunrise Than in the deepening of the azure noon, Gleaming untimely gold in fairer skies Than ever lay about an arctic moon. And I have caught in darkness ere the sun, A lovelier-liquid note from matin bird Warbled, than when the full day had begun, Or in the mid-day splendour I have heard. Better to leave behind a world to sigh, Than living fail a world to satisfy. A VIEW OF PETERBORO' MINSTER BY MOONLIGHT Threading the narrow ways of the town of my boyhood In silence of moon and frost; Sudden I paused and caught my breath in a wonder, Wondered, and held my breath. The minster arose, no longer the pile I remembered Of solid masonry built; But an exhalation, of solemn silver enchanted, A vision, no thing of stone. Like the vast and beautiful sigh of a wandering angel Here translated to earth, Or the tear of a spirit for all humanity fallen, The tear of an exiled God. And I feared, as I stood, that it might in a moment vanish, Vanish and utterly fade; Frail as a visible prayer up-breathed to the midnight, Starlike ending in stars. And I thought of the priestly masons of times forgotten Who builded, and building hymned. Had the mighty church become indeed as a vision, A fair intangible dream? And aisle and transept and choir created of moonlight To melt in the rising sun? So musing I roamed thro' the precinct and dead reposing, But sudden I knew and I wept; For I came at last to a tomb with splendour lighted, And the stone inscribed with thy name. THE REVEALED MADONNA As I stood in the tavern-reek, amid oaths and curses, Mid husbands entreated and drugged, Amid mothers poisoned and still of the poison sipping, Here harboured from storms of home; For a moment the evil glare on a woman falling Disclosed her with babe at her breast; An instant she downward gazed on the babe that slumbered, And holy the tavern grew, For she gazed with the brooding look of the mother of Jesus, On her lips the divine half-smile; An instant she smiled; then the tavern reeled back hell-ward, And I heard but the oath and the curse. THE WOMAN AND THE FLOWER I came into a garret where one lay A woman dying: round her children starved And piteously entreated her for bread. Her husband in the tavern drank and sang. Scarce could she speak, but on the coverlid The veinéd hand a wild flower held and clasped. I spoke to her of help, of life restored, Of hunger satisfied: she answered me: “The hunger that I have is for the flower; A deeper hunger than for any food. Why was I given this in my life so late? I did not know such things were in the world. Its colour kills me and the scent it gives. I could not rise up in this weary world Again; I have seen this and I long to go After it, follow it somewhere thro' the dark. So soft, so bright it claims me: let me die.” That night she died; the stumbling husband found Her cold, but in her hand fixed was the flower. INVALIDED I To England bear him wounded deep; Home to this island breeze; To leaves that medicine the brain, And ministering trees. II Where if he upward look, no vault Of fire his eyes shall view; But softer skies of passing cloud, Grey with a soul of blue. III And like a sister be the breeze, Star like a mother bend, And all-restoring Nature now The wounded soldier tend. IV At dawn the odorous unseen bush Into his room be blown; England through open window sweet Wafted from fields unknown! V Till that first zest of life return Upon a heart close-sealed; And like a child, and yet a man, He walks his native field. MY DEAD LOVE (Addition to the sequence entitled “The Apparition,” in the author's volume “Poems” 1898) I My dead love came to me in haste, And stood beside my bed, “Ah, why art thou so long away, Leaving me lone?” I said. II “Dearest, so many tasks and toils Are set the soul above; And dreadful errands that make pure, Belittle earthly love.” PROSPERITY A modern ballad I Wife, though the board between us gleams With glass and silver cell; And though in splendid silence stands Each liveried sentinel; II Though heavily the table glows, With many a monstrous bloom, And all of comfort and of cheer Forbids the human gloom; III There is a gulph between us fixt, Our souls can never cross, Nor you to me, nor I to you, Yet ours no tragic loss. IV No doubt, or soiléd faith hath raised The irremeable sea, That sunders with a silent surge The shores of you and me. V No festering secret such as eats Into an olden love, No white confession in moonlight This separation wove. VI No glamour in a slow decline, Or magic dead with days, Nor passion into friendship fled, Nor discontinued praise. VII True is it that no child was born To bind us with bright eyes; Or with its babble draw us close, Its chuckle at the skies. VIII Yet others closer-knit have lived, Joined by a yearning dumb; Though unconfessed, how deep the wish Burned, and was never numb. IX O smooth and rich and still our life, And oiled in every wheel; Anticipating every care Noiseless the servants steal. X You love your music, I my book; By some tremendous chord, Your soul is shaken in your stall, And with you is the Lord. XI A moment is your craving fed, Unspoiled by human speech; You leave the holy place; with all Your soul beyond my reach. XII Then should I meet you on the stair, You tremble as with sin; No murderess issued from the bed Could seem more dark within. XIII In deepest courtesy we pass; Yet never a word is said; As two ships without hail by night Pass when the moon is dead. XIV Decorous and slow each seventh day We to the church proceed Yet what have we to be forgiven, What absolution need? XV Our custom good; the vergers fly Like salesmen in a shop, In case the hassocks are too few, Or we a book should drop. XVI So hour by hour, and day by day, From placid week to week, Existence keeps its ordered path, Arranged each thing we seek. XVII Yet why, O wife, do you and I Scarce dare to speak or meet? What is the trouble twixt us two? A severance so complete? XVIII Wife, there hath dripped between our souls A dreary rain of days; Better mistake, or quarrel fierce, Better some spark or blaze! XIX Softness hath worn our love away; And smoothness passion slain; The dreadful gliding of a life, Unprivileged by pain. XX O let us tear us from this ease, And wheresoever hurled, Into the battle let us rush, And grapple with the world. CROMER ABBEY Here are the crimson flowers of sleep, But in this marsh may no man reap; More barren than the sea this land, More sterile than the ocean sand. And league on league is flat and dead, O'erflowing all with poppies red, For evermore unharvested. Yet springing from sterility The abbey rises to the sky, Fissured by years and rent with time, And yet bare-headed and sublime. More beautiful than any flower Stands from the waste the reverend tower, A ruin, lonely to the air; Massy, memorial, and bare. Where now are they, those holy men, Who laboured the unyielding fen? Who leaning on a spade would pray, And toiling carol all the day, Sending a lonely psalm on high, Or hymn uplifting to the sky? Some say that still at deep midnight You may behold a solemn sight Of cowléd men in order go, Passing in silence to and fro; Till once again a bell is rung And once the ancient anthem sung; Then all the throng will disappear, Leaving the dreariness more drear. Howe'er that be; now but remains The unpeopled flatness of the plains. KEATS TO FANNY BRAWNE You are the spirit of the haunted mere, O'erhung by whispering foliage, and you wear The shifting silver of the wayward moon; In you lies all the glory of the world, The splendours and the shadows of the sea; And all that grows and glows in you is shown, Red clouds of morning and the last of day. You are that Helen whose sweet smile allured The Grecian keels across Ionian foam; I think of you with all those damsels bright, Who, rising from green waves or forests dark, Waylaid the traveller to a perilous doom, Whether to silent foam of fairyland, Or the dense secret of entangling woods. And all about you is the mystery That haunts and tempts, and gleams, but ever flees. And yet at times I feel you but a shadow, Owing your magic to this fiery soul; I, I with golden fable gird you round, Or with a silver mist of antique dawn, With shapes from gorgeous cloudland and from dream. And ah, my tarrying with you is but brief, For death, red-bright, wells upward on my lips. A NIGHTMARE OF LONDON I dreamed a dream, perhaps a prophecy! That London over England spread herself; Swallowed the green field and the waving plain, Till all this island grew one hideous town. And as I gazed in terror rooted, so The City seemed to take a dreadful life, To be a monster that desired and felt; And still did she perceptibly advance, Blacken and grasp and seize and wither up. Northward she spread, and did assimilate Her sister cities of the loom and wheel That welcomed her with whirring ecstasies; She made the sky a pall, and as she moved, Blighted the breathing forests and the woods, And where the flower grew, now her pavement lay. And all the air grew dark, and there was heard, In place of rippling wave and whispering wind, Only the hoot of griding car, the shriek And fiery belch of engines to the cloud. A human army from before her fled; But swollen, spiderish, without shape or sleep, She stole, till now opposed her but the sea; Ocean preserved his sanctity of foam. ENCHANTMENT: “Woman Wailing for Her Demon Lover” Singing through the corn she goes; She no mortal sorrow knows; Singing clear as doth a brook, Rilling in a secret nook. Virgin is she in her thought, Lonely is she and unsought; All her soul is pure and free, Still as is the frozen sea. Yet away! Nor come again! For to love her were but pain; Vainly, vainly to pursue, Eyes of light and luring blue. Tell your passion! take her hand! Ah! she cannot understand Beautiful exceedingly; Perfect and without pity. Flee the maiden, lest she speak The faëry word, that makes thee weak! She they say in moonlight whist By a demon hath been kissed. THE DOOM OF SAILS Alas! must ye utterly vanish, and cease from amidst us, Sails of the olden sea? Now dispossessed by the stern and stunted ironclad, Wingless and squat and stern? Purple sails of the heroes lured to the Westward, Spread for the golden isles! Sails of a magic foam with faëry plunder, Wafting the wizard gold! Sails of the morning, come like ghosts on the sea-line, With midnight load of the deep! Sails of the sunset, red over endless waters, For the furthest Orient filled! Sails of the starlight, passing we know not whither, Silent, lighted, and lone! Sails of the seaman accursed, and cruising for ever Hoist by a spectral crew! Sails set afire by the lightning, resounding to tempest, That drum and thunder and sing! Sails that unruffled repose on a bosom of azure, Glassed by a placid flood! Alas! must ye go as a dream, and depart as a vision, Sails of the olden sea? THE AEROPLANE Leave us the air! enough the jar Of snorting engine, grinding car, The very heavens ye now would mar; Leave us the air! The air where dreamy birds do sing, Under Aurora reddening, And float on such a blissful wing. Leave us the air! Air doth the brow of age renew Darkly redeeming us with dew, And lifting to a boundless blue. Leave us the air! The ancient silence hath but stirred To solemn thunder and sweet bird; There must the aeroplane be heard? Leave us the air! Air that is bosom of our pain, That breathes on the besiegéd brain, And murmurs mercy of the rain; Leave us the air! Hither and thither are we tossed. Speed have we gained, but at the cost Of faded calm and firmness lost; Leave us the air! Whate'er the silly crowd enjoys, Our Progress is but stench and noise, We scream and shout and grasp but toys. Leave us the air! The earth is blackened from our eyes, And filled with dismal hoots and cries, Spare to profane the holier skies; Leave us the air! MUSIC AND THE WOMAN SOUL I All London in dim hurry streams Beside my door; then why, Cushioned in comfortable ease, Is mine this apathy? II And flower and plant upon me pall; Palls too the written page; The soundless and the sumptuous life, The splendour of the cage. III Death may some brilliant lightning flash, Some waking thunder roll; Till then I waste in cloudless calm, And starve through all my soul. IV Only by music am I freed, In melody find wings; No written word of poetry The mighty Spaces brings. V Then Sirius far behind me lies, The Sun is long outsoared; The Universe is but a sound, Creation but a chord! VI Here can I find my only flight, Tread where Beethoven trod; So am I raised, so am I rapt, And lose myself in God! THE SUBMARINE Suggested by Admiral Wilson's report I She slideth through the green sea-night, Certain and cruel without light; In ocean glooms her deaths are done, She craves no comfort of the Sun. II She striketh low, she striketh sure, No armour shall her thrust endure; The Iron-clad quails through every tower, Subsiding in elaborate power. III No mailéd fortress then shall save That metal mountain of the wave, No mounded castle of the deck, No yawning guns that yearn to speak. IV Once in the clear and cruder days A man might see the lunge that slays; The point the strove to baffle well, Missed, but not all in blindness fell. V But no man knoweth where She steals, If far away or at our keels; Sudden She strikes without a sound, And leaves a mute but mortal wound. VI What clamour of old ocean-war, What thunder belched at Trafalgar, Matches in terror the unseen Stab of the silent Submarine? VII So, late in time has come to be This man-built menace of the sea; God gave no monster to the main To make the works of man so vain. “AYE, BUT TO DIE!” When I would fain be freed of this dull breath, And tempt the dark uncertainty of death, Then Shakespeare's warning verse appals the mind; Regions of ice I fear and viewless wind; And yet that we shall cease forever trust, And this sad consciousness be blown in dust. But even though personality persist, And we endure behind this veiling mist; Give me Prometheus' crag, the undying thirst And unreached fruits of Tantalus accurst! Give me the fierce and purgatorial flame That eats into the soul and purges blame, And scorches with a realizéd shame; The cleansing torment, purifying slow, Till I ascend the wiser for the woe, Than here to drudge and ache, but never grow! If pain shall save, who then shall fear to die, And exaltation fetch from agony? O better all the terrors priests have told, That in dark durance may the spirit hold, Exile for æons from the smile of God, The unavenging, yet the chastening rod, Than this ignoble war of “how” and “whence,” The unglorious fight for necessary pence; In death at least I plunge in grander strife, Than sordid ills, wherewith this world is rife, Life's meanness makes the misery of life. THE FIREMAN (An impression of the street) His foe is fire, fire, fire! Hark his hoarse dispersing cry, From his path asunder fly! Speed! or men and women die, For his foe is fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! He is armed and helmed in brass, Let his thundering chargers pass; Be the iron Strand as grass, For their foe is fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! On he rushes as in gold, Under him a chariot rolled, As in Roman triumph old, But his foe is fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! Red the vault above him reels, Now the blistering stairway peels, But the battle-bliss he feels, For his foe is fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! Up the ladder flies he light, Disappears in dreadful night, Now re-starts upon the sight, Sudden out of fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! And no word the hero saith, Only on his arm hath breath Something between life and death, Snatched from fire, fire, fire! His foe is fire, fire, fire! Bring him to the victor's car, Richer is his spoil of war, Than from Roman battle far, Who has triumphed over fire. EMILY BRONTE Daughter of thunder and the northern moor, Singer of heath and grim and cruel souls. Yet of thy Love remembered deep in snow. Who taught thee in that bleakness to believe, Who told thee in that dimness so to trust Holding so fast a God for all the creeds? Loneliness only could such lightning make, So stern, so tender! only barren hills Could wring the woman riches out of thee. They live not long of thy pure fire composed, Earth asks but mud of those who will endure. Some star was too impatient for thy soul, In silence summoning through English dew. Did Shelley linger downward to grey hairs, Was Keats permitted that rich brain to glean, Or all his glowing morning to fulfil? Or Byron like thee in his later fire, When the true lightning of his soul was bared Long smouldering till the Missolonghi torch? Soul-solitary! taught by lonely flame; No need for thee to mix in civic crowds, Knowledge was thrilled to thee upon the heath, And wisdom came to thee from northern stars. Yet loving thy stern verse, I most am held By Heathcliffe following dreamily the dead. THE BLACK PERIL I Beware the black blood with the white! The skull of brass, the hands that tear! The lecherous ape, not human quite, The tiger not outgrown his lair! II Beware the strong and gleaming fangs, Fit for the forest where he ranged! The cruel simian arm that hangs! He goes upright, but is not changed. III Worse than the wolf descending gaunt, Or lion whom starvation brings, The village of the plain to haunt; For in your midst he prowls and springs. IV And him no shout upraised can fright, Nor lighted bon-fire scare away; Restless he crouches day and night, Leaps! and a woman is his prey. THE MISER MOTHER “Mother, what dost thou nigh my bed? Five years are gone since thou wert dead; All round us is the hush of night, And the moon is bright! “The moon shines through thee, mother old! What is it that thou wouldst unfold? In life thou ne'er didst love me well; What wouldst thou tell? “When I was but a lonely mite, How I would shudder from thy sight! And backward held my sobs for fear That thou shouldst hear.” “My son, forget the blows I gave! For we are weak within the grave; Never a blow this arm could deal, Which thou couldst feel! “Go! take from out the garden wall, The stone that nearest of them all Lies to the crumbling corner green Where the moss hath been. “There shalt thou feel a shining heap Of golden pieces hidden deep; Up now! and to the garden haste! The night doth waste. “Take up the golden pieces all Then dig, and let a few e'en fall Upon my coffin, of the best, That I may rest. “I ne'er did love thee from thy birth But I will bless thee under earth, If this my wish thou wilt fulfil, And I be still.” The mother faded without sound; Her son the golden pieces found; Dug deep; and what she so did crave Dropped in her grave. THE BLOW (The true story of an ancient house) I struck my dear son; I, his sire, An idiot made him in my ire; I hear him mumble in the sun, And see him listless walk and run. If I by penance might atone, And kneeling wear away the stone! If I might hope by prayer or fast To absolve me of my sin at last! Can any fast or penance heal The stare thy father's hand did deal? What withering vigil can restore Thy happy laughter as of yore? Thy mother of thy daftness died: She could not bear thee at her side; Thy vacant eyes became her doom, Thy jargon laid her in the tomb. See at my side he loves to stand, He puts into my own his hand; And at my knees his favourite place; God! how he smiles into my face! A PARTING Lone in the ghostly garden, Lone in the moonless night, I wait and watch thy window For thy coming taper light. Motionless all the garden, Though the heavy rose is sweet, Each bird hath sunk to silence, The dew is at my feet. At last thy light in the lattice, With narrow stream on the lawn! Ah, look thou forth but a moment, And flood me with thy dawn! Darkened again thy lattice! Hence! through the world my way; How all the garden shivered, Cold in the sigh of day! No more, nevermore shall I see thee, Clear candle of this soul: For the breaking ocean calls me With loud, estranging roll. A WOMAN She in a high walled garden walks, Drenching each flower; Or bends above her favourite beds After each shower. There seems no trouble in that brow, Those quiet eyes; The buds her silent children are, Their roof the skies. Was ever kiss upon those lips, Voice at her ear? Lived she as now for ever cold Without a tear? Ah! in the locked room in the night, May then be seen, Signs upon her, as on some shore, Where the sea hath been. A BALLAD I “Give me to drink,” the sick man cried, And straight his wife was at his side; He drank and of the draught he died. II That draught was brewed from drops of hell; The mortal drink she mixed so well, He back upon the pillow fell. III Adown the stairway slid she white, She felt a hot kiss without sight, And all the dark was falsely bright. MARGARET On that high hill above the wold, When the day has died in gold, Margaret! I have sung you mighty verse, Half of blessing, half of curse, Margaret! Yet though night hath brought a breeze, You are still as frozen seas, Margaret! And those lovely eyes are tired, Orbs of brown I have not fired, Margaret! Still you listen wearily, Striving to be kind to me, Margaret! LILY AND ROSE Roses bring we to our love, But lilies to the dead, White flowers to the breathless give, To the breathing, red. Yet soon the breathing shall be cold And earn the purer flower, The lily hath immortal lease, The rose an hour. MABEL She slumbers by the moorland stream That floods the brown stone fast; Into that sleep no dream shall come, No murmur of the past. Utterly cold she's grown to me, She careth nevermore; Though I be plunged in deepest sea, Or cast on furthest shore. So quick she was to note each tone, At every mood to start; Now death hath turned her into stone And taken away her heart. DREAMS AND THE DEAD Dreams can bring me back the dead; I with thee again may tread, As of old with thee I walk, Still in the olden garden talk. Though so rich, the moments fly, Pass they in futility. Dull our thought, our speech is slow, Over the earthy themes we go; So natural doth the moment seem, And we as idle as the dream. No news hast thou of heaven or hell, I nothing from the earth to tell. Sudden I wake! Thou art away! And ah what worlds had I to say! TREES O the trees feel before the soul The coming thunder-roll; So long have they been still; to-night They shivered, but with no delight. All night I watched them shiver, As for ever and for ever, And when the morning faintly shone, You whom I had kissed wert gone. THE SONG OF “RANJI” From a throne to the simple sward, Sudden to pass! From the aching Asian plains To the English grass! From the glitter fierce to the cool, Over the billow; From a crown to a cap pale-blue, From cedar to willow! From the stillness deep to the roar, To the green from the waste, From the howdah to hooting car, From the hush to the haste! From salaam to the friendly cheer, From the prince to the guest. From the shadowless to the shade, From the East to the West! “CRICKET I SING” (After Walt Whitman) Game of all games, than Olympian, Roman, serener; Cricket I sing! Here is no blood barbarian dyeing the sward; No thumbs turned upward or down. Only verdure and pipe-clay and silence perfect; The sacred silence of the game! Hark! I evolve under ribs of parody soul of an Epic, Who knows? Scintillant, modern, bizarre! Allons! The uncertainty, first of rain in the night, meaning so much, victory or defeat; The slow rolling of the ground, the roller how heavy! Five persons silent, bearing the shafts in front, One behind, solitary assisting, (he too playing his part), Or in your ear, camerado, does he but feign assistance, And in reality shoves not at all? The spinning of the coins by the captains before the pavilion, So much depending! The ringing of the bell! What bell indeed comparable, ship-bell, fire-bell, or bell even of tabernacle non-conforming? The arena of set faces! (The perfect white, now that I see clearer, of the popping-crease), The working-man, slunk from his sullen job away to the verdurous; The faultless, glossy, top-hatted he of the West; Business eschewed for the day anyhow. The fieldsmen emerging, some from one postern, some from the other; Yet wherefore, insula democratic? Is it so easy thus to sever the sheep from the goats? Silent I nudge thee, grim shag inhaler, beside me sitting, Dost thou not scent in this custom something feudal, passé? To me at least something mouldering, ivied, baronial. I know not who thou art, camerado, but from thy chin I guess thee A hater of razors and of kings. I surmise by that stubble democratic. Revenons! The stern tacit approach of the first two batsmen They take their guard, but glance fearfully around, Suspicious of ambush, laid either side. The sphinx-like umpire, surpliced, motionless! (Tho' for a matter of that a sudden leg-slash might render his children fatherless.) His decision final anyhow; no appeal! The score-board, infallible, the figures disappearing, returning, silent, Numerals as of Judgment-day! The panic of the young out-fieldsman, on test here, His first catch coming to him, the sun in his eyes, No thumbs turned upward, or down; only faces, Intent, judicial! If he should fumble it? Come now, memories, ghosts of Lord's, or the Oval! “W. G.” in his prime I see, black-bearded, ungainly, autocratic, With huge, thoughtful, bound-reaching stroke; Resourceful, a cumbrous ground-coverer, A luring, slow, aerial trundler, Incredulous of umpires! Spofforth, greyhoundish, lean, indefatigable, Furious, the problem before him; The wrist-sleeve masking the uncertain orb. Ranji, alert, Oriental, perfidious! With swift, sudden, unguessed glances, The silk shirt flapping to and fro on the dusk body, Quivering, mystical shirt! Bonnor, ambrosial, flaxen, gigantic, fleet! Shrewsbury, unexciting, each stroke a pattern, quietly perfect, a teacher. Blackham, prince behind stumps, gathering without fear Demon deliveries; Oft wounded ever returning! All these and others many I see as I lounge and lean on the rails; All these and others many I see, and I remember. THE ENGLISH SABBATH Smith in the week was dull enough, God knows, But doubly dull upon the Sabbath grows. An iron gong invites that soul of tin, A soul too grey for splendour of a sin. Sure of a heaven, he hears the tinkling bell, But has not yet ascended to a Hell. What weight is this that heavier makes the air? Hush! 'Tis the load of Smith's ascended prayer Recoiling back on him from Sabbath cloud, Returning on him though his knee be bowed. Each week-day Smith respectably can thieve But on the Sabbath would his God deceive. He kneels to pray, but ere his prayer has ceased Rises in fear his breeches may be creased; Later his wife from mundane matters free, Purring her Sabbath scandal pours the tea. O for some winnowing blast to swirl away The mouldering mummery of our Sabbath-day! LOVE AND THE POET You wonder why within your arms Laura, I seem to slight your charms; And yet when seas our spirit part, I waft you music of the heart. I am a poet, born to stray, And so my thoughts are far away. When Byron on the Italian breast His burning brow in passion prest, Dear Countess, while he gazed on you, His soul to Mary Chaworth flew. He was a poet, born to stray, And so his thoughts were far away. What woman will this satisfy In England or in Italy? It flatters not a lady's ear That only distance makes her dear. But every poet, born to stray, Still feeds upon the far-away. THE MODERN LOVER No more, Miranda, shed a tear That I but flirt, am insincere! Scan me no more with earnest eyes, Or seek a meaning in my sighs. To you I pay a compliment When nothing that I say is meant. I flatter, but I will not kneel, Ever I feign, but never feel. My wooing is the gayest lie, A shimmering, flitting phantasy, Aerial as the butterfly; And take a care that no one mentions A hint to me of my “intentions.” I'd not insult you, or intrude Upon you with “an impulse crude.” Love's but the flurry of a flunkey, The antic of the ancestral monkey. The utterance of the soul's upheaval Is really nothing but primeval; The solemn, serious “declaration” Degrades our polished generation. Remember when your tongue is tartest, That I, at least, am still an “artist.” MIRANDA'S EYES What colour are Miranda's eyes? Will no one tell me, pray? Now fleeting-blue as April skies, Sudden a tender grey! What is the colour of her eyes? What colour are Miranda's eyes? Are they of dawn or eve? A moment laughter in them lies; The next they seem to grieve. Tell me the colour of her eyes! What colour are my mistress' eyes? Painter lay down thy brush! How shalt thou seize what ever flies, Is brief, as is a blush, The colour of Miranda's eyes? What is the colour of her eyes, Those pools of mystery deep? Whatever lives, whatever dies, They mirror in a sleep. Such is the colour of her eyes. What colour are Miranda's eyes? For ah! when I her heart Would prove, I win but wild replies, Wild as those eyes that dart; Her heart is changing as her eyes. NERO'S MOTHER A DRAMA IN ONE ACT This one-act drama portrays a scene, which but for the exigencies of time would have been included in the play of “Nero,” so notably produced by Sir Herbert Tree at His Majesty's Theatre. The situation here is so intense, that in the author's opinion it can well supply material for a separate one-act play. PREFATORY REMARK The Emperor Nero having determined to rid himself of his mother Agrippina, whose influence thwarted him in all his designs, invited her to supper at Baiæ and after many pretended caresses escorted her to a ship which had been especially constructed to collapse in mid-sea. A tempestuous night was necessary to cover his design, but the Gods gave a brilliant sky and sea without a breath. The ship collapsed as was intended, but Agrippina escaped by swimming and reached her own villa on the Lucrine lake. Here she reflects on what had happened and awaits her doom at the hands of her son. CHARACTERS Agrippina (the mother of the Emperor Nero). Acerronia (her friend and companion). Myrrha (a maid attendant on Agrippina). Anicetus (a captain of the fleet and an instrument of Nero). Sabinus (a representative of the towns-people on the coast). [The scene is a chamber in the villa of Agrippina on the shore of the Lucrine lake. A large window on the right at back commands a view of the shore and near it is a table with a lamp burning. Lower down stage, on the right is a door communicating by steps with the shore. On the left is another door heavily curtained, leading to the chamber of Agrippina. The time is night and as the curtain rises loud shouts and cries can be heard from without congratulating Agrippina on her escape from shipwreck the night before. There can be seen the reflected light of many torches hither and thither waved along the beach in token of the popular joy. Myrrha is discovered gazing from the window on the assembled crowd laughing gleefully, and clapping her hands. As the curtain rises Acerronia comes from the door on the left from the presence of Agrippina.] Myrrha. [Turning excitedly to Acerronia who enters.] Will she not come, the Emperor's mother? Hark! [A loud shout arises and cries of “Agrippina” are heard from below.]Again, and yet again they cry her name, And some are dancing, many waving torches, And all aloud for Agrippina call! Look forth! [Acerronia goes and leans from the window, and a still louder shout is sent up.] They'll not depart; they will not sleep, Till Agrippina shows herself to them Safe from the wrecked ship. Acerronia. To and fro within She walks and murmurs to herself; then halts All suddenly; but moving still her lips In silence. There's a trouble at the soul, Which makes her deaf to all this shouted joy. Myrrha. Why! But last night and she escaped shipwreck. She should be rendering thanks upon her knees. Acerronia. I tell you there's some fierce tumult within; She puts some dreadful question to herself. [A knock is heard, then a still louder shout and in the reflected glare of torches Sabinus from the door on the right bursts into the room with others following.] Sabinus. We would congratulate the Emperor's mother. May we not speak with her? Will she not see us? Acerronia. [Going to the curtained door.] I'll tell her that you come to speak with her. [Exit.] Sabinus. [To Myrrha.] A moment to declare the public joy And thanks of all this coast that she is safe, Delivered from the peril of the deep. [Enter Acerronia, who pulls aside the heavy curtain as Agrippina enters. Agrippina advances and Sabinus, throwing himself on his knees, kisses her hand. He then rises.] Sabinus. We could not choose, O Lady Agrippina, But seek you out to show you our delight. [A loud shout is again heard.] Hark to this multitude that throng the shore, All hoarse with salutations who await The sight of you from yonder window thrown. And not alone have we a cause for thanks In that a sudden ship-wreck was escaped, But also that to Nero, to your son, You now are reconciled, so through the world Lasting tranquillity is granted us. Agrippina. I thank you all for true words from the heart, And for your simple joy that I am safe, And to my son last night was reconciled. How good is human speech that we can trust, And even though we be royal can believe! I'll show myself a moment. [She goes to the window, Myrrha holding up a golden lamp which lights up Agrippina's face and the acclamations are redoubled. As she turns from the window, Sabinus and his followers make an obeisance and retire.] Agrippina. [Slowly.] Seen from the window, how did yester-night Appear, disturbed or calm? Myrrha. O calm my Lady. The bay was like a floor that we could dance on And all the coast as clear as in daylight. Agrippina. Then does it not seem strange, nay wonderful That any ship should sink in such a sea, A brilliant heaven and a breathless deep? Acerronia. What is so treacherous as a glassy sea, What is so full of moods and sudden frets? Agrippina. [Eagerly.] Ah, that is true! Acerronia. Some under-current might— Agrippina. Yes, yes! who knows? Who can foretell or guard? How my heart clutches what my brain rejects! O to you two I must unfold my soul! 'Twas the uncertain sea; no human guile. If it were planned! The Gods at least would lend No colour to it. Myrrha. Planned! Agrippina. Planned by my son. Acerronia. Why! It is said he lay upon your breast Showering his kisses on you. Agrippina. Yes, he laid His head down on my bosom as of old. He seemed to me but as a child again, I stroked his hair, while he would kiss my hand, Or smile up in my face as a babe does. You cannot guess how eagerly I long To think that which I wish; and to believe That which I fear to trust; but I have been So schooled my brain is mistress of my heart. O but his touch had ancient tenderness! His eyes filled with the tears of long ago. Or were those fingers but the sheathed claws And talons of the tiger-cat; those tears A treacherous rheum called up at will? No, no! Myrrha. Mistress! Agrippina. [Sinking in a chair.] O if I might have lived secure! Only a woman busied with her flowers, And turning unto music at twilight; That passes from a garden to a grave; While one saith to another, “Hast thou heard, She died last night?” O if I might have dwelt Safe with the dim untempted Average! O had I been a wanderer on the road, That dreams on hay beneath a summer moon, All night a river running at his ear! Yet could I quench this fire with any flower? What fall of dew could slake this thirsting soul? O vain, vain, vain! [Suddenly rising.] Girls, may you never bring A man-child to the sun; and live to fear His kisses and grow careful of his clasp! Acerronia. Imperial Lady, hark not back to that! Agrippina. [Pacing to and fro.] Would I had been born barren in the light! Would I had lingered fruitless to the ground, Drooping with all my wishes to the earth, And so escaped the pangs precursing bliss To others! Why must I in pain bring forth That which shall tear me, why am I twice rent? Wherefore am I delivered of a monster That naturally on its mother turns, And sets its teeth there where it drew its life? What but a lair for adders have I been, A chest of poison or a dagger sheath? What but— [She pauses suddenly, listening.] Myrrha. My Lady, what so suddenly Arrests you? Agrippina. Listen! Acerronia. I can hear no sound. Myrrha. Nor I. Acerronia. What cry hath marbled you so still? Agrippina. No cry, but—silence! Listen! Why has ceased So suddenly the clamour from the shore? There is no single voice that rises now. Listen! At last comes clear upon the air The regular murmur of ocean on the stones, Till now unheard; hushed is the voice of man, Only the sea hath anything to say. Myrrha. [Going to the window.] And every torch that but this moment burned, Is vanished everywhere and all is dark. [Agrippina goes and slowly seats herself in the chair.] Agrippina. Come from the window, touch the harp for me! What does this mean? What bodes this sudden lull? [Myrrha begins to touch the harpstrings, when suddenly a loud knock comes on the door beneath. There is a pause.] Myrrha. I cannot hold the harp. Acerronia. I grow afraid. Agrippina. Children, be still! What is it that you fear? Perhaps Sabinus is returned. Acerronia. That knock Had more imperious sound. Agrippina. Myrrha, play on. Acerronia. Lady, forgive me, but I fear to stay. [She hurries out through the curtain doorway. A second and louder knock is heard.] Agrippina. [To Myrrha, who starts up in alarm.] O child be still! Perhaps my son has sent a messenger For news of me. Myrrha. Why do they open not? They all are fled below. I cannot stay Longer. I seem to suffocate with dread. [She, too, is going out.] Agrippina. You, too? Myrrha. O Lady, could I stay, I would, But— [She follows Acerronia out.] Agrippina. O there is no escape! Who can escape From Rome? She sentinels the utmost sea And sundered island; none can fly from Rome. [A sound comes as of a door broken down. There is the heavy tramp of armed men on the stair. Then the door on the right is dashed open and Anicetus enters. Agrippina, who has re-seated herself, does not rise; the lamp illumining her face. She does not deign to speak. At last the silence is broken by Anicetus.] Anicetus. Imperial Lady, the Emperor has sent us To ask if you are yet recovered quite The shock of ship-wreck? He can find no sleep, Pacing in deep anxiety the shore And he will have no peace till we return. Agrippina. Peace! Anicetus. We would hear from you by spoken word What to report to him. Agrippina. [Quietly.] Then tell my son That I am—well; a little shaken yet, But in a long sleep shall recover quite. My arm you see is bruised, but even now Is healing without pain. Tell him from me His mother would not he should vex himself With apprehensions; I shall soon be well. Anicetus. I will inform him so. Agrippina. And say this, too, That I would like to go far, far away And live out what remains to me of life In deep seclusion, with no rankling thought But memory; I could join his wife perhaps Octavia, in Pandateria; And find her a companion in exile; Tell him my head is weary of the state, And aches too much with this Imperial care. And now, no doubt, it is as well that he Go on alone; I set him where he is, Now leave him to himself; I feel that I Am but a bar to his Imperial dream. But yet I hope that my son's reign may far Outsplendour all precedent Emperors, And with his triumphs Rome may roar and rock. My place will be to watch him afar off, And catch great news of him with throbbing heart, Loving him from the limits of the world. Anicetus. I'll so report you. Agrippina. [Gradually losing her self-control.] So I understand The Emperor is much perturbed in mind. Can he not find relief in harp-playing, Or in some verse upon my near escape? [She rises, speaking with passion.] O let this solemn folly have an end! You are sent here to kill me, that I know. [Anicetus starts.] Why else this military silence kept? And I am caught here without hope of flight, To die as the rat dies. Give me a sword And Nero, set us one against the other, And let me fight for life to kill this whelp. [A murmur.] But if I must die here, then tell him this, That dead I'll vex him worse than e'er in life, Gathering an added swiftness from the tomb, And unretarded by the body strike. Did Clytemnæstra need to cry aloud Upon the slumbering Furies? They shall start Upon my whisper, hissing in his ear For all his deep draughts of Falernian wine. The night may pass, but the red cloud of dawn Shall bring the colour of his mother's blood. You, Anicetus, are well chosen here, You have not yet forgot the public jest I put upon you before all the court, I see them laugh still at your scarlet face. Not all the blood you spill upon this floor Shall ever wipe that ringing laughter out. Anicetus. Lady, I have forgotten. [Half unsheathing his sword.] Agrippina. No, ah, no! Else would you not so fumble with your sword; Insult, and blows, and ruin are forgot, Ridicule never; 'tis the eternal thrust. This vengeance that you take with arméd men Is somewhat heavy-handed, Anicetus, Lacking in lightness and in humour; you Have no reply but dullness of a blow, But I have stabbed your littleness more deep Than ever you my greatness could assail. [She snatches up the lamp and dashes it on the floor, plunging the stage in darkness.] 'Tis dark and I am ready for the grave. [As one of the soldiers is stealing up behind her she stops him.] Not in the back! In front this wound should be! Nero, strike here, here strike where thou wast born! [The curtain rapidly falls as they rush upon her.] THE ADVERSARY A DRAMA IN ONE ACT OF FOUR SCENES The idea of this brief drama is based on that of a play by Calderon. Beyond this, it is entirely original. CHARACTERS Fernando Del Castellano (a middle-aged, impoverished descendant of an ancient house). Marguerita (his youthful wife, daughter of a wealthy merchant). A Physician. An Old Family Servant. The Figure. Scene I. [The chamber of an ancient castle in Toledo. This chamber is evidently stripped and dismantled. Pedestals where statues have stood, outlines upon the walls where old pictures have hung, certain figures in armour of Fernando's ancestors alone remain. Fernando is sitting with his wife by a dying fire. The time is deep midnight.] Fernando. O Marguerita, this dismantled room, This old ancestral chamber stripped and bare, A leafless forest ruined by the blast, Strikes to my heart. Pictures and statues, blades, Encrusted long ago with infidel blood, And holy relics and memorials dear Bequeathed through ages, sold or carried off! The glory of our house is past away; And, dearest, most for thee my heart is sore. I took thee young from wealth and ease, and now Though still but on the verge of womanhood, Here have I pent thee in a house despoiled. [She draws closer to the scanty fire as he rises excitedly and paces to and fro.] Yet am I answerable, have I incurred This ruin? ever thriftily I lived, Drank not, nor gambled, yet each day, each hour Some new misfortune bows me to the earth. Some enemy remorselessly pursues me. Marguerita. An enemy! hark back into the past; Canst thou remember any thou hast wronged Who takes, though late, this vengeance? Had thy father Some foe ancestral and still unappeased? Fernando. I know of none that ever I have wronged. Marguerita. Unconsciously, perhaps? Fernando. Nor did my father Warn me of any such descended wrath. This only have I found, that field on field, And all this long inheritance hath past Into the hands of one whose name is hid; Who lunges at my breast behind a mask. Vainly I seek this foe for evermore. [His wife rises, shivering, as the first grey of the dawn appears.] Marguerita. Dawn peereth, I must go in to the child. [She kisses Fernando and passes through the decayed arras into an inner room.] Fernando. [Turning to the armed ancestral statues.] Ye armed ancestral figures of my house, Ye statesmen dim, captains of long ago, Declare to me doth any ancient wrong, Committed in far years, at last on me Evolve this dreadful consequence? Ah, thou, Thou old Pizzaro of infamous memory, Dark tales and legends grim are told of thee, Thy rapes, thy rapines, and thy blasphemies. Didst thou engender in a wilder day A curse, which innocent I expiate? Speak, one of you now glimmering in dawn. [Dawn begins to touch the armed figures.] All silent! Yet I cry again, invoke The very dead for answer. Who is he, That hath despoiled me thus and stripped me bare And made me naked before all men? The Figure. [Appearing masked and muffled against the stained window.] I. I. Fernando. [In slow horror.] Thou? Who art thou? Art thou a breathing thing? Or but the apparition of a brain O'ercharged? Thy face is hid. Who art thou? Speak! [As Fernando slowly approaches the figure, it vanishes as the curtain falls.] Scene II. [The same chamber. Midnight. As the curtain rises the clock strikes twelve. Fernando is seen standing in the very place where the figure has disappeared in Scene one.] Fernando. He then, that figure, muffled close and masked, Visible suddenly in grey of dawn, Accused by his own mouth of all this doom, From him I wrung no answer. As I stole To'ard him he vanished, silent as he came. [He looks into the inner room.] The child sleeps; but his mother! Midnight struck! 'Tis not her wont to be so late away. [Enter an old servant of the house in shabby livery, bearing a letter.] Servant. Master, my mistress gave this in my hand Enjoining I should not deliver it Until the clock struck twelve. [Fernando seizes the letter, breaks the seal and reads.] Fernando. [Reading.] Husband, I have left thee and my home and I shall not return. But of this be at least assured, that my honour is unstained. I have not fled to the arms of any other. Forgive me and teach the child also to forgive. Marguerita. [Fernando motions the servant to retire.] Fernando. Was not this desolation of my hearth Heavy enough, that she must now forsake me, No reason given? Doubtless the gnawing care, Anxiety for evermore renewed, And bareness when in plenty she had lived, Impelled her to inflict this final blow. [Suddenly he starts and, softly opening the arras, gazes into the room within.] But he, our child, how calmly slumbering. So that but for the colour in his cheek That sleep might well appear the sleep of death, Him even she leaves; a creature of the waste, And scenting death, will not desert her young. What influence then, what terror so could urge her, Since not into another's arms she fled? Then what compulsion irresistible? The Figure. [Again visible as before.] I. Fernando. Thou again, and masked and muffled still! And with thy own lips dost again pronounce Thyself the cause of headlong misery. Thy name! Thou canst not now withhold thy name! [A pause.] How have I wronged thee?—Yet what wrong so deep, That could this desolation justify? [A pause.] No answer still? Art thou of flesh and blood? Or com'st thou from the grave, even in death Bearing me malice from the underworld? Art thou perchance a spirit deep incensed, Still nursing hot a far off injury, That thus thou dost pursue me hour by hour? This vengeance seemeth more than mortal work. Whate'er ensues I'll put thee to the proof. [He rushes towards the figure as though to grasp it but again it vanishes as the curtain falls.] Scene III. [Again the dismantled chamber. Deep night. Fernando in an attitude of suspense is standing at that arras door, which now opens, and a white-haired physician enters slow and silent.] Fernando. [With outstretched arms.] The child? Still is there hope? Answer me. [The physician makes no answer but bows his head in silence.] Dead? [The physician approaches him and mutely endeavours to console him, leading him to a chair, into which Fernando helplessly sinks.] [The physician seeing his attempts at consolation are futile is about to retire, when Fernando stops him with a gesture.] Fernando. Doctor, these cumulated miseries, Of which this is the last and worst, I fear, Have shaken my reason. It has seemed to me That after each new fallen calamity, Here in this very room, by yonder window, A figure has appeared shrouded and masked, Which, when I cried to heaven to show me cause Of these extreme inflictions, answered “I.” Yet could I draw from it no plainer word; And when I have approached, it vanished straight. Tell me, for you maintain an equal pulse, Is this a self-created apparition, Born of a fevered and tormented mind? Or does it come for vengeance and alive? Watch with me now and re-assure my brain. Physician. Small wonder that a mind so deeply torn Should call up phantoms in mere ecstasy! I will dispatch thee, ere the morning break, A kind and drowsy syrup to bring sleep. [After once again laying his hand on Fernando's shoulder he silently retires.] Fernando. Almighty God that sittest in the heavens, Thou Who dost punish, yet with justice, I Demand of Thee, as Thou wilt judge us all On that last day when graves give up their dead, Why I am thus afflicted and pursued; First in the desolation of my hearth, Then in the causeless fleeing of my wife, Now in the dying of my only child; What curse is on me? The Figure. [Again appearing.] I. Fernando. Again thou comest, Now for a third time! 'tis not possible Thou art a phantom; clearly I behold thee; I know thee for mine enemy, thou hast said it, Three times pronouncing thee the cause of woe. I will pursue thee over land and sea, No forest is so deep that it shall hide thee, There is no wall so strong, no lock so fast, That it shall shelter thee. As thou hast me, So will I thee pursue unto the end. I am a lonely man, bereaved and stripped; To this bare task I now devote myself. Here I take oath in this dismantled room, By yonder still warm body of my child, That I will hunt thee sleepless through the world, Till I have called thee to a dread account. [He rushes towards the figure as though to assail it, but again it vanishes as the curtain falls.] Scene IV. [A narrow street ending in a cul de sac. Lurid sunset. The figure is seen striding slowly towards the cul de sac. Fernando suddenly appears pursuing, breathless, haggard and unkempt.] Fernando. At last I have thee. Hence is no escape! Here must thou turn at last, at last reveal thee. Remove thy vizor or I tear it from thee! [Drawing his sword.] Here, if thou art a thing of flesh and blood, Thou canst not still refuse me satisfaction, On guard, sir! I'll not stab thee in the back. The Figure. [Slowly turning and removing his mask discloses the very features of Fernando himself.] Fernando, art thou satisfied? Fernando. [With a loud cry.] Myself! [He falls dead at the feet of the figure, which stands over him, beginning to fade as the curtain falls.] THE KING A TRAGEDY IN A CONTINUOUS SERIES OF SCENES NOTE This play is constructed after the Greek and not the Shakespearian model, and is divided into a series of scenes, not acts. The subject is one of intense tragedy, but the author hopes that he has treated a story, inevitably grim and reminiscent of the Athenian drama, with something of Greek reticence and dignity. CHARACTERS Philip (King of Spain). Don Carlos (his son and heir). Gonzaga (Prime Minister). Fernando (an old servant). Christina (a lady of the Court). Nobles, Prelates, Courtiers, Couriers, etc. [The Scene is the ancient capital of Madrid.] Scene I. Audience Chamber. The Court Assembled. The King. Princes and prelates, nobles, courtiers, friends! Now thirty years have I unfaltering Held in these hands the reins of policy, And here have pacified and there repressed, Pursuing peace with unsurrendered power. And much of this felicity I owe To sage suggestion of Gonzaga here. [A murmur of admiration runs through the court.] But, friends, I grow aweary of my task, And would relinquish onerous royalty. And this high seat I lightly abdicate Since in my vacant room I set my son [An applauding shout, which visibly pleases the King.] Carlos. His youth unstained, his grave record When youthful blood hath license, recommends him. But that he might not climb these stairs untried, But straight from battle to a throne proceed, Against Granada I have now despatched him. To expel the encroaching Moor; each moment now I look for him; but, happier augury, I publicly proclaim that he shall wed The princess child of royal Portugal. This marriage builds a barrier doubly strong, Against assault a rampart twice secure. [Here Christina, a lady of the court, swoons, and is borne outward.] So with a twofold gladness I expect A son that warrior comes and bridegroom, too. [A courier rushes in breathless and kneels before the King.] Courier Out of Granada, tidings hear, O King! The city is retaken, the Moor is fled; And brightest over all in battle burned The Prince, who by a sudden flank assault Drove headlong the surprised Moroccan arms; And still they fled, and still the Prince pursued. Already hard upon me is our host. [The sound of arms and bugles of the returning army is heard, and with loud triumphant shouts the court disperses to welcome the victors, leaving only the King and Gonzaga.] The King Gonzaga, let me not in flood of joy Omit a duty. She who swooned but now, Doña Christina, I have reared till now. But ere I abdicate I will to leave A spacious and a broad estate to her, To be a home, or dowry should she wed. Her mother I knew well in other days. I cannot leave her to a youth's caprice, Who might o'erlook her need, no cause assigned. Let this not slip! Gonzaga O King, be thou assured. [A burst of music outside, and Don Carlos rushes in, blood-spattered, and is caught in his father's arms, who holds him close in silence.] The King My dear, dear son!—God, for this perfect moment Let us not suffer afterward! Again, Again I kiss thee through the spattered blood. Thou hast no scar? Carlos Scathless have I come off. The King And now I gird on thee this dazzling toy; [He girds a jewelled dagger on the Prince.] A toy, yet capable of mortal use. [The Prince draws the blade and looks smilingly at it.] Carlos A pretty thing to wear, if not to use. The King But now to give felicity a crown, My son, a bride awaits thee! [The Prince starts away from his father, who, however, continues unconsciously.] Ah, this news Strikes sudden on you! Listen, then! [He takes the Prince by the arm, walking to and fro excitedly.] She is A royal daughter out of Portugal. This marriage seals two neighbour kingdoms close, And builds a bristling frontier 'gainst the Moor. So you as soldier and as lover reign! What is your answer? [The Prince remains silent, with bowed head. The King stands gazing at him astonished. A pause.] Carlos, answer me! [Still the Prince is silent. Again a pause.] Boy, look up in my face and speak, at least! And let me have a human word from you! Carlos [Raising his head] Father, I am o'er-flurried from the war, Give me a little pause! The King A pause? But why? Have I deserved such silence from my son? Have I not compassed you with deeper love Than e'er man gave to woman? Since you lisped, Have I not hoarded every whisper up? Have I not cried aloud to God for thee? Hot speech from you, or maddest reason given I can endure, but motionless refusal, Silence and sullenness I will not bear. That you must seek and choose your phrase I loathe. When have I given you cause to hide your thought, Until this instant so transparent clear! [He paces to and fro in agitation, then pauses before his son.] Still silent! Carlos Father, give me till to-night! The King Child, you have not lived long enough to know What pain you deal me with your secretness. Gonzaga Prince, you will pardon me, but on your word Hangs here the embassy from Portugal. It will be taken at that fiery court An insult, making more for war than peace If this proposéd marriage you defer, And no cause given. Carlos To-night I'll give the cause, Father, to you alone—then as you will. The King How suddenly my bliss is clouded o'er, And what was free and bright, constrained and dark. To-night your certain answer then! [Going.] To-night! [Exeunt King and Gonzaga. The Prince passes his hand over his brow in a gesture of doubt and terror.] Scene II. Don Carlos and Christina [The scene is a sequestered arbour in an obscure part of the royal garden. Here amid the shrubs and fragrant bushes of that teeming southern land have these two been accustomed to meet. As the curtain rises they are clasped in a silent embrace.] Christina [drawing slightly apart from him] Dear, all the palace rings with thee; thy charge And headlong, wild, improbable assault, That from Granada flung the Moor surprised; And I have listened, glowing secretly. I said no word, but gloried to myself. My very silence was more proud than words. But ah! before the heroic news came in, The King, thy father, 'pointing you his heir, Spoke of an alien marriage politic, To be a barrier and a wall to Spain. Then, ah, forgive my weakness, I fell back, Borne to the air. Carlos This moment I have left My father for the first time wroth and sad; For well you know that he and I have lived Transparent as two friends, no shade between us. He broke to me this marriage in blind joy: I answered not; dear, dear, what could I say? Last he appointed I must answer him To-night. The embassy from Portugal Expects from me a “Yes” that will be “No.” Christina Carlos, I feel that I should go from you. [He starts and clasps her more closely to him.] I stand between you and the public weal. Belovéd, howsoe'er these lips are sweet, You shall not set my kiss before a throne, Prefer a lonely woman to the State. [He starts impatiently.] No! hear me to the end. You shall fulfil This marriage, Love, the issue is too vast; The safety of this ancient throne, and rule Of all this murmuring nation. But the heir That shall be born— [She comes close to him, whispering in his ear.] our child already lives. Carlos You mean? Christina For the first time I have felt it stir Within me; then I swooned amid the court. Carlos [In wild agitation] Then doubly, trebly, am I now resolved, Since two lives hang on me, and now not one, That you shall be my wife, and publicly Raised to the dazzling splendour I inherit. O pale the anointing oil, and dim the crown, If thou wert not beside me sitting; or I will forego the glory and the war, The applause, and battle glistening in the sun, And we will quit the splendour hand in hand, Walking together like two simple folk, Who love and cannot see the earth for love. Christina No, no! I must renounce the very life; The gold presented cup of crimson wine; And I will be to you as are the dead, If one can die, and yet consume in flame. Ah, but renunciation hath a fire, It is not cold; God knows it is not cold. What battle like this battle? I forsake Deliberately, as a woman can,— For to a man possession is the sum, The charm, the mystery and azure light; So strong my love of you; I'll pass away; And fear not that our babe shall ever know Who is his father; I will cherish him By the slow stream and grasses far from courts. Even now he feels out blindly toward the sun, Moving in me as in a world obscure. We two shall be most happy so alone. If thou, for we are mystically knit, Shouldst hear a pretty babble in the night, Out of strange fields, and know it is thy son, Yet still be strong; I'll see thee nevermore. [Suddenly clasping him to her.] No more! Ah! but thou'lt come, if only once! And I shall run and hurl me on thy heart, And as out of great darkness see a light. But no, come not to me! I'll not forget; I shall go down, filled with thee, to the grave. And still I tell thee, put my arms aside! A boy thou wast, now seek the sterner task! Carlos A boy! I am no boy; deep in my blood, Too deep, a moment ever to be moved, My thought of you. Is't the mere touch of lips, To feel my circling arm about your waist, To murmur verses under fading stars? Why you encircle me as doth the air, And nothing breathes or moves apart from you. The universe hath got from you a soul; Since first I saw you, on a fated night, From the dark palace casement secretly, Leaning with loosened hair to midnight lilies, O then more solemn grew the woods, the hills More strange, the mere more perilous still, More lone the bird, returning in red light, And ah! that moon new brought upon the heaven! Thou art more sweet than souls of evening flowers In a dim world, and ere a star hath come. Vain, vain the throne! for thou alone art real! But see, the sun is falling down in gold, And with the night I must await the King. You'll leave me not? [Again clasping her close.] Christina I will not. Yet I fear.— [He tears himself away as the light rapidly darkens.] Scene III. [The King's Private Chamber. The Prince has asked to see his father alone before giving his answer to the ambassador from Portugal, in regard to the proposed political marriage. The King and Carlos.] The King Carlos, since first I gave you to the light, Never a cloud has come between us two. This is the first, dispel it now with speed! Carlos Father! The King I have not been o'er-strict with you, Never asserted a mere father's right. But we have been as friends; never before Have you refused me confidence; yet now You stand in guarded silence which I loathe, As though you must be careful with your words; 'Tis this I hate, not any folly done, Whate'er it be; but that you will not speak To me, to me, at least. Carlos But I will speak; Forgive me whatsoe'er I shall disclose; Father, your life serene to all is known, Your days ascetic, and, my mother dead, Never a woman has had power on you. The King O, it is that way, is it; so I guessed; [Taking his son's arm, he walks to and fro with him in a friendly fashion.] Listen! A young man's trouble, natural To youth, appears to stay you from this marriage. 'Tis difficult to take a solemn view, [The Prince starts.] Yes, yes, I know! I only ask of you That you are free with me; I have the right. I'll save your blushing cheek and stammering tongue; Hunting perhaps the deer, or walking lone Through distant villages, you saw some maid, Simple and sweet amid our summer fields, Her beauty breathing fragrant as the hay, And lingering with her in a twilight lane, Followed the kiss and then the uttered word, By passion sped, repented in the cold. Carlos No, no, you understand me not at all. The King Too well I understand. But I would tell you I cannot take this prank of blood as grave. [Laughing as he walks with the Prince to and fro.] Twilight, a hedge of may, and coming stars, A face amid the dimness! All is said. Confess now, I have hit you. Carlos Father, no! The King Still, still you will not satisfy me, boy; Have I not made confession's pathway soft? And yet you will not tread it. Silent still! Now I will humble my white hair to you, And tell you, I myself, young then as you, Was drawn into sweet folly; but the throne Demanded me and all this people's care. Then I dismissed each wanton, wandering thought, And set my teeth and rose to sterner things. And this you too must do; the occasion cries Aloud for sacrifice of crude desires, It asks for wisdom, wildness put aside. Carlos Pity me, father! The King Now that I have bent So far, as to unfold to my own son A far-off folly, is it much I ask That you should open to me all your soul? Come, come! Some girl you cannot bring to court. Carlos No, for she is already of the court! The King Ah, this is better. For at least this fault Was with some lady nobly born? Carlos 'Tis so. She hath been nobly born, and in her face, Her step, the certain proof of lineage high. The King But there hath been no secret marriage, speak! Carlos As yet no marriage! The King Then my fears are o'er. All this is easy, and what seems to you So tangled, this Gonzaga can unravel, For he is ripe and still and unsurprised. You say it is some lady in my court. I'll not demand her name; unless you give it, And be assured, for my own sake that name Shall never be divulged. Carlos Sir, you have been So open and so much a trusted friend All those past years, and now you show yourself So easy with me that I'll not keep back The name of her I love. The King You love? Ah well!— Carlos Believe me that I do. The King [Similing.] I once thought so. Well, well? Carlos The name I call her is Christina. [The King starts back, grasping the rail of the throne; there is a breathless pause.] Father, I know not of her parentage, Nor who her mother and her father were; It is sufficient that she is received Among the noble ladies of your court. So much for that; but that her blood is proud, You, you yourself—if you would scan her close, Could not deny; even royal I would take her, But that I know that here she would not stand Attending, came she true from royalty. The King [With difficulty recovering speech.] But there has been no marriage. Carlos No, not yet. The King O boy, be frank with me; I am very old, If only then that I am old refuse not Answer! Carlos I will not. All things I will tell. The King Then how far has this matter gone, say, say! You think me too impatient, but impatience Is due to tremulous age. I understand Almost without the telling, it has been The kiss forbidden and the secret speech And ancient poetry beneath the moon, The touch of hand—yes, yes, perhaps the clasp, When the last star is fading to the dawn, No more?—You understand, I press you not. But there hath been no more? Carlos There has been more. The King But you two, you are not abandoned yet To the act of fire? Carlos Even to the act of fire. The King God, God! Carlos O, Sir, you say that you yourself Were in your youth not guiltless, why of me Ask such a dread account? Father, I love you, I love you, ah forgive me. The King I love you. Carlos Then here I kneel, I pray you to forgive me, I will not loose your knees till you relent. The King [Kissing the bent head of the Prince] I kiss you as of old. Carlos I feel your tears Drop on my hair. The King Vain tears of an old man. But one thing else; so far then things have gone Between you, but no issue of that act? Carlos Alas! I have just learned from her own lips That I have brought new life into this world. The King O Thou, that sittest in Thy heaven, relent! They say that when a thing is done 'tis done. It is a lie; our lightest act takes wings, And is made free of space for evermore. Carlos But, father, though a child is born to me Out of this passion and none borne to you, Am I therefore more guilty than yourself? And for this reason now am I resolved That she shall be my wife, and publicly My wife proclaimed; my love had been enough. But now this marriage is demanded of me. The King This marriage cannot be. Carlos [Angrily approaching his father] What, then, shall stay me? Let go the crown! The high, imperial seat! The glory and the marching hosts of war. All these are faint beneath a woman's smile. What then shall stop me, or who shall intervene? Not you yourself, you even, my very father. What high compulsion? The King This: I am her father. [The King falls backward unconscious on the throne, the Prince staggering from him in horror.] Scene IV. [Again the secluded arbour. Christina, singing softly to herself, starts suddenly to her feet as she is aware of Carlos standing silently gazing on her; but not as formerly approaching her.] Christina Ah! [She rushes towards him. He steps backward, motioning her away. She stands transfixed.] Love, why do you motion me away? And say no word at all? Why may I not Fly to thee to be gathered on thy heart As ever? What is my unconscious fault? What is my ignorant trespass? Or has thy father Between us fixed a gulf as deep as that Between the poor man and the rich in hell? Or hast thou done some rash thing in thy rage? Carlos, thou hast not stained thy hands in blood? Horrible! in his blood? Thou dost not stir! And still and dim thou growest and far-off, Looking into my eyes a long farewell. Love, if I may not come to thee, yet tell me, And swiftly, in warm words, what hath befallen, What sudden thing hath come between us two? Carlos No sudden thing, but one far back in time. Christina I cannot gather this. Is't that he knows— Carlos He knows. Christina Even then 'tis not in thee To shudder away from me; rather to hold me Closer, and with strong arms to shelter me. If we have sinned beyond a father's pity, Then with how many lovers are we damned! Carlos [With repressed passion] Believe me that I have not shrunk from you From ebbing passion, or from guilty fear. At heaven I'd spit back immortality, Might I one moment cross this yard of ground That separates us now: but we henceforth Must keep a measured distance evermore. Christina Is then our love so cursed? Carlos [Wildly] Cursed? Ah, how cursed! Lady, no love was ever cursed as this. Our kiss was potent to put out the stars. Christina Lady! Carlos Come thou no nearer, but declare Whose child thou art. Christina My mother I remember— Carlos Thy father? Christina Died, they said, ere I was born. Carlos But if he lives? Christina He lives? My father lives? Carlos And reigns! Christina I reel and fall into thy arms. Carlos I must not clasp her, tho' she reel and fall; I dare not touch her body even in death. Christina [Recovering herself in slow effort.] And all that time thy kisses were—how sweet! [A pause.] Yet all unconsciously we came to this, And in all innocency have we loved. Carlos Yet unto this we came. Christina O Carlos, now A sterner summons asketh more of us Than just to part; that I should say farewell, And pass out of thy life for evermore. Now not to thee alone I say adieu; I say farewell to all the earth at once. I stifle to be gone; I ache to plunge In the pure water of the purging grave. And yet—and yet—O, I must cry it out To all the gods assembled with cold eyes. I love, love, love thee, past all bar of birth. Forgive me, Christ, I cannot help but love him. Carlos Cease! Or I'll leap this interval of earth, And in the face of God Himself regain thee. [A silent flash of lightning is seen.] They thrust at us from on high; there is no need: For me this earthly steel suffices well. [Touching the dagger with which he is girded.] Christina For thee and me—together must we die. Carlos Now 'tis the deep of night. Christina I will not wait The sun with curious accusing beam. Carlos This love was of the night, not of the sun. Christina This night then, and with speed! Surely we two Of all who ever loved are most unhappy. Lovers who fell in death in olden time Might sob the life out in each other's arms. Carlos Or she did take the poison from his lips. Christina A venom sweet—though all the dark to come! Carlos His whisper weakened, yet into her ear. Christina Dimmer she gazed, but yet into his eyes. Carlos Over them came old odour of red may. Christina Or the sweet rustle of forbidden lanes. Carlos But we with failing breath apart must lie; Beautiful earth whereon we must not stay! Christina And you, forbidden stars, how bright to leave! Carlos On all the glory now we look our last; And without kiss, Christina or pressure of the hand, Albeit we sway together helplessly, Hopelessly t'ward each other swaying still, Like trees across a river, then withdraw. Carlos Yet without cry, but with a Roman heart We seek the steel that giveth honour back. Christina [Gently] Perchance, when we have winged a separate flight, When we are free of flesh, from blood released, God will not place his bar between our spirits, For nowise in the spirit have we erred. Carlos [Drawing the dagger given him] This blade my father gave me in his joy; See how the jewelled haft sparkles and gleams. 'Tis fitting we should use it in our sorrow. Now to some darker place, that we may die. Christina Carlos, thou, thou wilt kill me first. Carlos I cannot. Christina Give me the steel! I feared that I might strike Uncertainly: the child here must not linger. [She, taking the glittering dagger, goes slowly out, he following her.] Scene V. [The Throne-Room. The King is seen standing near the throne, which he does not ascend, Gonzaga attending.] Gonzaga [After a pause. He speaks somewhat lightly.] The affair no doubt is angry and perplexed. More deeply difficult than any I Have disentangled. But no problem yet, No situation howsoe'er confused, Hath baffled me; and with the sagest heads, The wariest brains, my lot hath been to fight. Doubt not, Your Majesty, that he who once Outthought and outdid scheming Angelo, Shall bring to wisdom fancy of a boy. The King No fancy, it hath struck too deep, I fear. Gonzaga Nothing in youth strikes deep; or not so deep, But it can be persuaded or outplucked. Leave then the boy to me. I have dispatched On all sides messengers to find him out And bring him to a private conference Forthwith; he hath not gone far in so short time. Leave him to me and be yourself unseen. You by, I cannot undertake to speak That which I have already in my mind. And I have here a list of those most near, Both to your throne and heart; to call them in And at the fitting moment speak to them. But be not seen; each moment he may come. Such was the summons that he must obey. The King I'll go apart; God aid your conference. [Exit the King. Meanwhile a courier has entered, with lantern, who stands silent.] Gonzaga [Seeing Courier] Well, have you found the Prince? When will he come? First Courier My lord, where'er you sent me I have searched But found no sign. Gonzaga Nor heard you any news? First Courier From no one could I glean a certain word. [A second courier appears on the other side.] Gonzaga [To First Courier] Well, go again! Don Carlos must be found. [Exit First Courier. Gonzaga turns on the second.] And you? Second Courier All o'er the palace garden dark I sought and left no cranny unexplored. Night makes more difficult our task; the eye Deceives, and we must touch to be assured. [A third courier comes in behind him.] Gonzaga You there who come behind, you have some clue? Third Courier None, none, my lord, I fear the Prince is gone. Gonzaga Gone whither? Third Courier That I cannot tell. But we Lose time to look for him still hereabout. Gonzaga Back, both of you! Although all night you spend. You'll be well paid; the King for tidings chafes. [Exeunt Second and Third Couriers. Gonzaga, impatiently turning from them, encounters an old man, entering slowly on the opposite side, holding his left hand behind him.] Gonzaga Ah! old Fernando! well from you I knew I would have certain tidings at the last. Is the Prince on his way? Fernando Ay! But not hither. Gonzaga Darkly you speak. And why behind you held Your left hand, as to hide some precious thing? A jewel is it? Fernando 'Tis a jewelled thing. Gonzaga What then? Fernando [Holding a dagger blood-stained.] A blade, and dyed with twofold blood. Gonzaga [Starts back in horror.] This is his answer eloquent to me! Fernando This blood I know; 'tis that of my young lord; For I have bound up many a careless wound He has incurred; the other blood was strange. But I have found from whom the stream hath flowed. Gonzaga Say then what other blood with his is mixed. Fernando I came upon two lying motionless In a dark covert; and the moon was full. They lay in no embrace, not even hand In hand was clasped, nor to each other turned; As though they feared each other more than death, And yet they looked a lover and his love. The Prince I knew, and by his side the blade. The other— Gonzaga But one other there could lie. Give me the knife! You still composure keep, And summon all of those here written down, That they attend forthwith in the outer room The pleasure of the King. Take this and go. [Exit Fernando with papers. Gonzaga stands gazing on the dagger held before him. Silently the King enters from behind the throne. There is a pause.] The King That blade I gave to Carlos. Gonzaga He hath used it. [The King for a time preserves a deadly calm.] The King This is the life-blood of my only son. Gonzaga O King! The King And she— Gonzaga She too hath dyed the steel. The King Strange that I cannot cry aloud, nor weep! Give me the dagger! It is doubly mine; This horror muffles me as in a dream, And all unreal is this encrusted toy. [Suddenly, with a loud cry, he reels backward, caught in Gonzaga's arms.] My children! [A pause; slowly he recovers himself.] Two I had; a boy and girl, I with a far-off kiss have slain them both. If they can die so young, then I so old Will follow them down to an equal tomb, I, the grand cause, and this at least I owe, My place is with them. Gonzaga [pointing to the throne] No, thy place is there, With suicide an opiate refused, And madness a rejected luxury. Thy life is not thy own; thou canst not now Abdicate, leaving on the throne a ghost; Whate'er it cost, thou must resume thy reign. And I have news of the advancing Moors, Granada is retaken; in the hour Of public peril crush the private grief; The nobles, sharers of our inner mind, I have convened already; they await A word to gather round thee as of old. [Gonzaga gives a sign, and the higher nobles of the court enter the throne-room in silence.] The King Gentlemen, but a little while ago My abdication I declared and made My son successor to this arduous chair. That son, my son, is dead and lies self-slain In the dark garden; through my fault he died. When I was young I took too little heed, And in rash passion I begot a child, A daughter whom I brought into the court. This was a young man's folly natural, But see to what a doom those kisses led. My son,—if my voice break a little, yet Have patience—my dear son this daughter loved, Unknowing. [A murmur of astonishment amid the court, who yet preserve a respectful silence.] They two secretly would meet. My sin was but rehearsal of their sin, A sad enacting of the tragic scene. With a new life he filled her; learning then That they inherited a common blood. They saw but one path, and that path they took, And lie together in some grand embrace, Not now forbidden. When this doom I heard, I too resolved me on a similar grave. But now I see how easy it is to die, How hard to live. This throne I re-ascend. [He mounts the steps of the throne alone, unaided.] Bring me again the crown, anoint me fresh With oil; a second coronation this. [The crown is again placed on his head, he is anointed with oil, in silence and with no triumphant cry.] Here I resume my reign without a hope; My life is ashen, as this ashen dawn That comes upon these windows colourless; It is as grey, it is as cold, as faint. Yet here I take it up. I had supposed That double death were punishment enough; Sequel how solemn to so frail an hour. But God, unsatisfied, must still inflict This grander chastisement, that I must reign, And unforgetting seem that I forget, Losing dead children in a living task. I have laid bare my soul before you all, Nothing have I concealed and nothing slurred. Most humbly now I re-ascend the throne. [The whole of the court fall on their knees in a silence of supplication. There is a pause.] Hark! In the bleakness a half-note of birds. Curtain</field>
