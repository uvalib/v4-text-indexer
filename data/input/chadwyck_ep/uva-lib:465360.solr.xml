      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE SABBATH: A POEM. Luce sacra requiescat humus, requiescat arator, Et grave, suspenso vomere, cesset opus. How still the morning of the hallowed day! Mute is the voice of rural labour, hushed The ploughboy's whistle, and the milkmaid's song. The scythe lies glittering in the dewy wreath Of tedded grass, mingled with fading flowers, That yester-morn bloomed waving in the breeze: Sounds the most faint attract the ear,—the hum Of early bee, the trickling of the dew, The distant bleating, midway up the hill. Calmness sits throned on yon unmoving cloud. To him who wanders o'er the upland leas, The blackbird's note comes mellower from the dale; And sweeter from the sky the gladsome lark Warbles his heaven-tuned song; the lulling brook Murmurs more gently down the deep-worn glen; While from yon lowly roof, whose curling smoke O'ermounts the mist, is heard, at intervals, The voice of psalms, the simple song of praise. With dove-like wings, Peace o'er yon village broods: The dizzying mill-wheel rests; the anvil's din Hath ceased; all, all around is quietness. Less fearful on this day, the limping hare Stops, and looks back, and stops, and looks on man, Her deadliest foe. The toil-worn horse, set free, Unheedful of the pasture, roams at large; And, as his stiff unwieldy bulk he rolls, His iron-armed hoofs gleam in the morning ray. But chiefly Man the day of rest enjoys. Hail, Sabbath! thee I hail, the poor man's day. On other days, the man of toil is doomed To eat his joyless bread, lonely; the ground Both seat and board; screened from the winter's cold, And summer's heat, by neighbouring hedge or tree; But on this day, embosomed in his home, He shares the frugal meal with those he loves; With those he loves he shares the heart-felt joy Of giving thanks to God,—not thanks of form, A word and a grimace, but reverently, With covered face and upward earnest eye. Hail, Sabbath! thee I hail, the poor man's day: The pale mechanic now has leave to breathe The morning air, pure from the city's smoke, While, wandering slowly up the river side, He meditates on Him, whose power he marks In each green tree that proudly spreads the bough, As in the tiny dew-bent flowers that bloom Around its roots; and while he thus surveys, With elevated joy, each rural charm, He hopes, yet fears presumption in the hope, That Heaven may be one Sabbath without end. But now his steps a welcome sound recals: Solemn the knell, from yonder ancient pile, Fills all the air, inspiring joyful awe: Slowly the throng moves o'er the tomb-paved ground: The aged man, the bowed down, the blind Led by the thoughtless boy, and he who breathes With pain, and eyes the new-made grave, well pleased: These, mingled with the young, the gay, approach The house of God; these, spite of all their ills, A glow of gladness feel; with silent praise They enter in. A placid stillness reigns, Until the man of God, worthy the name, Arise, and read the anointed shepherd's lays. His locks of snow, his brow serene,—his look Of love, it speaks, “Ye are my children all, The gray-haired man, stooping upon his staff, As well as he, the giddy child, whose eye Pursues the swallow flitting thwart the dome.” Loud swells the song: O, how that simple song, Though rudely chaunted, how it melts the heart, Commingling soul with soul in one full tide Of praise, of thankfulness, of humble trust! Next comes the unpremeditated prayer, Breathed from the inmost heart, in accents low. But earnest.—Altered is the tone; to man Are now addressed the sacred speaker's words. Instruction, admonition, comfort, peace, Flow from his tongue: O chief let comfort flow! It is most wanted in this vale of tears: Yes, make the widow's heart to sing for joy; The stranger to discern the Almighty's shield Held o'er his friendless head; the orphan child Feel, mid his tears, I have a father still! 'Tis done. But hark that infant querulous voice! Plaint not discordant to a parent's ear: And see the father raise the white-robed babe In solemn dedication to the Lord: The holy man sprinkles with forth-stretched hand The face of innocence; then earnest turns, And prays a blessing in the name of Him, Who said, Let little children come to me; Forbid them not: “And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it he was much displeased, and said unto them, suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.” —Mark, x. 13, 14, 15, 16. The infant is replaced Among the happy band: they, smilingly, In gay attire, wend to the house of mirth, The poor man's festival, a jubilee day, Remembered long.— Nor would I leave unsung The lofty ritual of our sister land: In vestment white, the minister of God Opens the book, and reverentially The stated portion reads. A pause ensues. The organ breathes its distant thunder-notes, Then swells into a diapason full: The people rising, sing, With harp, with harp, And voice of psalms; harmoniously attuned The various voices blend; the long-drawn aisles, At every close, the lingering strain prolong. And now the tubes a mellowed stop controuls, In softer harmony the people join, While liquid whispers from yon orphan band Recall the soul from adoration's trance, And fill the eye with pity's gentle tears. Again the organ-peal, loud-rolling, meets The halleluiahs of the choir: Sublime, A thousand notes symphoniously ascend, As if the whole were one, suspended high In air, soaring heavenward: afar they float, Wafting glad tidings to the sick man's couch: Raised on his arm, he lists the cadence close, Yet thinks he hears it still: his heart is cheered; He smiles on death; but, ah! a wish will rise,— “—Would I were now beneath that echoing roof! No lukewarm accents from my lips should flow; My heart would sing; and many a Sabbath-day My steps should thither turn; or, wandering far In solitary paths, where wild flowers blow, There would I bless His name who led me forth From death's dark vale, to walk amid those sweets; Who gives the bloom of health once more to glow Upon this cheek, and lights this languid eye.” It is not only in the sacred fane That homage should be paid to the Most High; There is a temple, one not made with hands,— The vaulted firmament: Far in the woods, Almost beyond the sound of city chime, At intervals heard through the breezeless air; When not the limberest leaf is seen to move, Save where the linnet lights upon the spray; When not a floweret bends its little stalk, Save where the bee alights upon the bloom;— There, rapt in gratitude, in joy, and love, The man of God will pass the Sabbath-noon; Silence his praise: his disembodied thoughts, Loosed from the load of words, will high ascend Beyond the empyrean.— Nor yet less pleasing at the heavenly throne, The Sabbath-service of the shepherd-boy. In some lone glen, where every sound is lulled To slumber, save the tinkling of the rill, Or bleat of lamb, or hovering falcon's cry, Stretched on the sward, he reads of Jesse's son; Or sheds a tear o'er him to Egypt sold, And wonders why he weeps; the volume closed, With thyme-sprig laid between the leaves, he sings The sacred lays, his weekly lesson, conned With meikle care beneath the lowly roof, Where humble lore is learnt, where humble worth Pines unrewarded by a thankless state. Thus reading, hymning, all alone, unseen, The shepherd-boy the Sabbath holy keeps, Till on the heights he marks the straggling bands Returning homeward from the house of prayer. In peace they home resort. O blissful day! When all men worship God as conscience wills. Far other times our fathers' grandsires knew, A virtuous race, to godliness devote. What though the sceptic's scorn hath dared to soil The record of their fame! What though the men Of worldly minds have dared to stigmatize The sister-cause, Religion and the Law, With Superstition's name! yet, yet their deeds, Their constancy in torture, and in death,— These on tradition's tongue still live, these shall On history's honest page be pictured bright To latest times. Perhaps some bard, whose muse Disdains the servile strain of Fashion's quire, May celebrate their unambitious names. With them each day was holy, every hour They stood prepared to die, a people doomed To death:—old men, and youths, and simple maids. With them each day was holy; but that morn On which the angel said, See where the Lord Was laid, joyous arose; to die that day Was bliss. Long ere the dawn, by devious ways, O'er hills, thro' woods, o'er dreary wastes, they sought The upland moors, where rivers, there but brooks, Dispart to different seas: Fast by such brooks, A little glen is sometimes scooped, a plat With green sward gay, and flowers that strangers seem Amid the heathery wild, that all around Fatigues the eye: in solitudes like these Thy persecuted children, Scotia, foiled A tyrant's and a bigot's bloody laws: There, leaning on his spear, (one of the array, Whose gleam, in former days, had scathed the rose On England's banner, and had powerless struck The infatuate monarch and his wavering host,) The lyart veteran heard the word of God By Cameron thundered, or by Renwick poured In gentle stream: then rose the song, the loud Acclaim of praise; the wheeling plover ceased Her plaint; the solitary place was glad, And on the distant cairns, the watcher's ear Sentinels were placed on the surrounding hills, to give warning of the approach of the military. Caught doubtfully at times the breeze-borne note. But years more gloomy followed; and no more The assembled people dared, in face of day, To worship God, or even at the dead Of night, save when the wintry storm raved fierce, And thunder-peals compelled the men of blood To couch within their dens; then dauntlessly The scattered few would meet, in some deep dell By rocks o'er-canopied, to hear the voice, Their faithful pastor's voice: He by the gleam Of sheeted lightning oped the sacred book, And words of comfort spake: Over their souls His accents soothing came,—as to her young The heathfowl's plumes, when, at the close of eve, She gathers in, mournful, her brood dispersed By murderous sport, and o'er the remnant spreads Fondly her wings; close nestling 'neath her breast, They, cherished, cower amid the purple blooms. But wood and wild, the mountain and the dale, The house of prayer itself,—no place inspires Emotions more accordant with the day, Than does the field of graves, the land of rest:— Oft at the close of evening-prayer, the toll, The solemn funeral-toll, pausing, proclaims The service of the tomb; the homeward crowds Divide on either hand; the pomp draws near; The choir to meet the dead go forth, and sing, I am the resurrection and the life. Ah me! these youthful bearers robed in white, They tell a mournful tale; some blooming friend Is gone, dead in her prime of years:—'twas she, The poor man's friend, who, when she could not give, With angel tongue pleaded to those who could; With angel tongue and mild beseeching eye, That ne'er besought in vain, save when she prayed For longer life, with heart resigned to die,— Rejoiced to die; for happy visions blessed Her voyage's last days, Towards the end of Columbus's voyage to the new world, when he was already near, but not in sight of land, the drooping hopes of his mariners (for his own confidence seems to have remained unmoved) were revived by the appearance of birds, at first hovering round the ship, and then lighting on the rigging. and, hovering round, Alighted on her soul, giving presage That heaven was nigh:—O what a burst Of rapture from her lips! what tears of joy Her heavenward eyes suffused! Those eyes are closed But all her loveliness is not yet flown: She smiled in death, and still her cold pale face Retains that smile; as when a waveless lake, In which the wintry stars all bright appear, Is sheeted by a nightly frost with ice, Still it reflects the face of heaven unchanged, Unruffled by the breeze or sweeping blast. Again that knell! The slow procession stops: The pall withdrawn, Death's altar, thick-embossed With melancholy ornaments,—(the name, The record of her blossoming age) appears Unveiled, and on it dust to dust is thrown, The final rite. Oh! hark that sullen sound! Upon the lowered bier the shovelled clay Falls fast, and fills the void.— But who is he, That stands aloof, with haggard wistful eye, As if he coveted the closing grave? And he does covet it; his wish is death: The dread resolve is fixed; his own right-hand Is sworn to do the deed: The day of rest No peace, no comfort, brings his woe-worn spirit; Self cursed, the hallowed dome he dreads to enter; He dares not pray; he dares not sigh a hope; Annihilation is his only heaven. Loathsome the converse of his friends! he shuns The human face; in every careless eye Suspicion of his purpose seems to lurk. Deep piny shades he loves, where no sweet note Is warbled, where the rook unceasing caws: Or far in moors, remote from house or hut, Where animated nature seems extinct, Where even the hum of wandering bee ne'er breaks The quiet slumber of the level waste; Where vegetation's traces almost fail, Save where the leafless cannachs wave their tufts Of silky white, or massy oaken trunks Half-buried lie, and tell where greenwoods grew,— There, on the heathless moss outstretched, he broods O'er all his ever-changing plans of death: The time, place, means, sweep, like a stormy rack, In fleet succession, o'er his clouded soul,— The poignard,—and the opium draught, that brings Death by degrees, but leaves an awful chasm Between the act and consequence,—the flash Sulphureous, fraught with instantaneous death;— The ruined tower perched on some jutting rock, So high that, 'tween the leap and dash below, The breath might take its flight in midway air,— This pleases for a time; but on the brink, Back from the toppling edge his fancy shrinks In horror; sleep at last his breast becalms,— He dreams 'tis done; but starting wild awakes, Resigning to despair his dream of joy. Then hope, faint hope, revives—hope, that Despair May to his aid let loose the Demon Frenzy, To lead scared Conscience blindfold o'er the brink Of self-destruction's cataract of blood. Most miserable, most incongruous wretch! Dar'st thou to spurn thy life, the boon of God, Yet dreadest to approach his holy place! O dare to enter in! may be some word, Or sweetly chaunted strain, will in thy heart Awake a chord in unison with life. What are thy fancied woes to his, whose fate Is (sentence dire!) incurable disease,— The outcast of a lazar-house, homeless, Or with a home where eyes do scowl on him! Yet he, even he, with feeble step draws near, With trembling voice joins in the song of praise. Patient he waits the hour of his release; He knows he has a home beyond the grave. Or turn thee to that house, with studded doors, And iron-visor'd windows;—even there The Sabbath sheds a beam of bliss, tho' faint; The debtor's friends (for still he has some friends) Have time to visit him; the blossoming pea, That climbs the rust-worn bars, seems fresher tinged; And on the little turf, this day renewed, The lark, his prison mate, quivers the wing With more than wonted joy. See, through the bars, That pallid face retreating from the view, That glittering eye following, with hopeless look, The friends of former years, now passing by In peaceful fellowship to worship God: With them, in days of youthful years, he roamed O'er hill and dale, o'er broomy knowe; and wist As little as the blythest of the band Of this his lot; condemned, condemned unheard, The party for his judge:—among the throng, The Pharisaical hard-hearted man He sees pass on, to join the heaven-taught prayer, Forgive our debts, as we forgive our debtors: From unforgiving lips most impious prayer! O happier far the victim, than the hand That deals the legal stab! The injured man Enjoys internal, settled calm; to him The Sabbath bell sounds peace; he loves to meet His fellow-sufferers, to pray and praise: And many a prayer, as pure as e'er was breathed In holy fanes, is sighed in prison halls. Ah me! that clank of chains, as kneel and rise The death-doomed row. But see, a smile illumes The face of some; perhaps they're guiltless: Oh! And must high-minded honesty endure The ignominy of a felon's fate! No, 'tis not ignominious to be wronged; No;—conscious exultation swells their hearts, To think the day draws nigh, when in the view Of angels, and of just men perfect made, The mark which rashness branded on their names Shall be effaced;—when, wafted on life's storm, Their souls shall reach the Sabbath of the skies;— As birds, from bleak Norwegia's wintry coast Blown out to sea, strive to regain the shore, But, vainly striving; yield them to the blast,— Swept o'er the deep to Albion's genial isle, Amazed they light amid the bloomy sprays Of some green vale, there to enjoy new loves, And join in harmony unheard before. The land is groaning 'neath the guilt of blood Spilt wantonly: for every death-doomed man, Who, in his boyhood, has been left untaught That Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace, unjustly dies. But ah! how many are thus left untaught,— How many would be left, but for the band United to keep holy to the Lord A portion of His day, by teaching those Whom Jesus loved with forth-stretched hand to bless. Behold yon motly train, by two and two, Each with a bible 'neath its little arm, Approach, well-pleased as if they went to play, The dome where simple lore is learnt unbought: And mark the father 'mid the sideway throng;— Well do I know him by his glistening eye That follows stedfastly one of the line. A dark seafaring man he looks to be; And much it glads his boding heart to think, That when once more he sails the vallied deep, His child shall still receive Instruction's boon. But hark,—a noise,—a cry,—a gleam of swords!— Resistance is in vain,—he's borne away, Nor is allowed to clasp his weeping child. My innocent, so helpless, yet so gay! How could I bear to be thus rudely torn From thee;—to see thee lift thy little arm And impotently strike the ruffian man,— To hear thee bid him chidingly,—begone! O ye, who live at home, and kiss each eve Your sleeping infants ere ye go to rest, And, 'wakened by their call, lift up your eyes Upon their morning smile,—think, think of those Who, torn away without one farewell word To wife, or children, sigh the day of life In banishment from all that's dear to man,— O raise your voices, in one general peal Remonstrant, for the opprest. And ye, who sit Month after month devising impost-laws, Give some small portion of your midnight vigils, To mitigate, if not remove the wrong. Relentless justice! with fate-furrowed brow! Wherefore to various crimes of various guilt, One penalty, the most severe, allot! Why, palled in state, and mitred with a wreath Of nightshade, dost thou sit portentously, Beneath a cloudy canopy of sighs, Of fears, of trembling hopes, of boding doubts! Death's dart thy mace!—Why are the laws of God, Statutes promulged in characters of fire, “And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.”—Exod. xix. 16. Despised in deep concerns, where heavenly guidance Is most required! The murderer—let him die, And him who lifts his arm against his parent, His country,—or his voice against his God. Let crimes less heinous dooms less dreadful meet, Than loss of life! so said the law divine, That law beneficent, which mildly stretched To men forgotten and forlorn, the hand Of restitution: Yes, the trumpet's voice The Sabbath of the jubilee “And thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven Sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.”—Lev. xxv. 8. 9. 10. announced: The freedom-freighted blast, through all the land At once, in every city, echoing rings, From Lebanon to Carmel's woody cliffs, So loud, that far within the desart's verge The couching lion starts, and glares around. Free is the bondman now, each one returns To his inheritance: The man, grown old In servitude far from his native fields, Hastes joyous on his way; no hills are steep, Smooth is each rugged path; his little ones Sport as they go, while oft the mother chides The lingering step, lured by the way-side flowers: At length the hill, from which a farewell look, And still another parting look, he cast On his paternal vale, appears in view: The summit gained, throbs hard his heart with joy And sorrow blent, to see that vale once more: Instant his eager eye darts to the roof Where first he saw the light: his youngest born He lifts, and, pointing to the much-loved spot, Says,—“There thy fathers lived, and there they sleep.” Onward he wends; near and more near he draws: How sweet the tinkle of the palm-bowered brook! The sun-beam slanting thro' the cedar grove How lovely, and how mild! but lovelier still The welcome in the eye of ancient friends, Scarce known at first! and dear the fig-tree shade, 'Neath which on Sabbath eve his father told “And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.—Thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.”—Deut. vi. 6. 7. 21. Of Israel from the house of bondage freed, Led through the desart to the promised land;— With eager arms the aged stem he clasps, And with his tears the furrowed bark bedews: And still, at midnight-hour, he thinks he hears The blissful sound that brake the bondman's chains, The glorious peal of freedom and of joy! Did ever law of man a power like this Display? power marvellous as merciful, Which, though in other ordinances still Most plainly seen, is yet but little marked For what it truly is,—a miracle! Stupendous, ever new, performed at once In every region,—yea, on every sea Which Europe's navies plow;—yes, in all lands From pole to pole, or civilized or rude, People there are, to whom the Sabbath morn Dawns, shedding dews into their drooping hearts: Yes, far beyond the high-heaved western wave, Amid Columbia's wildernesses vast, The words which God in thunder from the mount Of Sinai spake, are heard, and are obeyed. Thy children, Scotia, in the desart land, Driven from their homes by fell Monopoly, Keep holy to the Lord the seventh day. Assembled under loftiest canopy Of trees primeval, soon to be laid low, They sing, By Babel's streams we sat and wept. What strong mysterious links enchain the heart To regions where the morn of life was spent! In foreign lands, though happier be the clime, Though round our board smile all the friends we love, The face of nature wears a stranger's look. Yea, though the valley which we loved be swept Of its inhabitants, none left behind, Not even the poor blind man who sought his bread From door to door, still, still there is a want; Yes, even he, round whom a night that knows No dawn is ever spread, whose native vale Presented to his closed eyes a blank,— Deplores its distance now. There well he knew Each object, though unseen; there could he wend His way, guideless, through wilds and mazy woods; Each aged tree, spared when the forest fell, Was his familiar friend, from the smooth birch, With rind of silken touch, to the rough elm: The three gray stones, that marked where heroes lay, Mourned by the harp, mourned by the melting voice Of Cona, oft his resting-place had been; Oft had they told him that his home was near: The tinkle of the rill, the murmuring So gentle of the brook, the torrent's rush, The cataract's din, the ocean's distant roar, The echo's answer to his foot or voice; All spoke a language which he understood, All warned him of his way. But most he feels Upon the hallowed morn, the saddening change: No more he hears the gladsome village bell Ring the blest summons to the house of God: And,—for the voice of psalms, loud, solemn, grand, That cheered his darkling path, as, with slow step And feeble, he toiled up the spire-topt hill,— A few faint notes ascend among the trees. What though the clustered vine there hardly tempts The traveller's hand; though birds of dazzling plume Perch on the loaded boughs;-“Give me thy woods, (Exclaims the banished man) thy barren woods, Poor Scotland! sweeter there the reddening haw, The sloe, or rowan's Mountain-ash. bitter bunch, than here The purple grape; dearer the redbreast's note, That mourns the fading year in Scotia's vales, Than Philomel's, where spring is ever new; More dear to me the redbreast's sober suit, So like a withered leaflet, than the glare Of gaudy wings, that make the Iris dim.” Nor is regret exclusive to the old: The boy, whose birth was midway o'er the main, A ship his cradle, by the billows rocked,— “The nursling of the storm,”—although he claims No native land, yet does he wistful hear Of some far distant country, still called home, Where lambs of whitest fleece sport on the hills; Where gold-specked fishes wanton in the streams; Where little birds, when snow-flakes dim the air, Light on the floor, and peck the table-crumbs, And with their singing cheer the winter day. But what the loss of country to the woes Of banishment and solitude combined! Oh! my heart bleeds to think there now may live One hapless man, the remnant of a wreck, Cast on some desart island of that main Immense, which stretches from the Cochin shore To Acapulco. Motionless he sits, As is the rock his seat, gazing whole days, With wandering eye, o'er all the watery waste; Now striving to believe the albatross A sail appearing on the horizon's verge; Now vowing ne'er to cherish other hope Than hope of death. Thus pass his weary hours, Till welcome evening warn him that 'tis time Upon the shell-notched calendar to mark Another day, another dreary day,— Changeless,—for in these regions of the sun, The wholesome law that dooms mankind to toil, Bestowing grateful interchange of rest And labour, is annulled; for there the trees, Adorned at once with bud, and flower, and fruit, Drop, as the breezes blow, a shower of bread And blossoms on the ground: But yet by him, The Hermit of the Deep, not unobserved The Sabbath passes.—'Tis his great delight. Each seventh eve he marks the farewell ray, And loves, and sighs to think,—that setting sun Is now empurpling Scotland's mountain-tops, Or, higher risen, slants athwart her vales, Tinting with yellow light the quivering throat Of day-spring lark, while woodland birds below Chaunt in the dewy shade. Thus, all night long He watches, while the rising moon describes The progress of the day in happier lands. And now he almost fancies that he hears The chiming from his native village church: And now he sings, and fondly hopes the strain May be the same, that sweet ascends at home In congregation full,—where, not without a tear, They are remembered who in ships behold The wonders of the deep: “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.”—Psal. cvii. he sees the hand, The widowed hand, that veils the eye suffused; He sees his orphan'd boy look up, and strive The widowed heart to sooth. His spirit leans On God. Nor does he leave his weekly vigil, Though tempests ride o'er welkin-lashing waves On winds of cloudless wing; In the tropical regions, the sky during storms is often without a cloud. though lightnings burst So vivid, that the stars are hid and seen In awful alternation: Calm he views The far-exploding firmament, and dares To hope—one bolt in mercy is reserved For his release; and yet he is resigned To live: because full well he is assured, Thy hand does lead him, thy right hand upholds. “If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.”—Psal. cxxxix. And thy right hand does lead him. Lo! at last, One sacred eve, he hears, faint from the deep, Music remote, swelling at intervals, As if the embodied spirit of sweet sounds Came slowly floating on the shoreward wave: The cadence well he knows,—a hymn of old, Where sweetly is rehearsed the lowly state Of Jesus, when his birth was first announced, In midnight music, by an angel choir, To Bethlehem's shepherds, “And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And, lo! the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not, for, behold! I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”—Luke, ii. 8.—14. as they watch'd their flocks. Breathless, the man forlorn listens, and thinks It is a dream. Fuller the voices swell. He looks, and starts to see, moving along, A fiery wave, “In some seas, as particularly about the coast of Malabar, as a ship floats along, it seems during the night to be surrounded with fire, and to leave a long tract of light behind it. (so seems it) crescent formed, Approaching to the land; straightway he sees A towering whiteness; 'tis the heaven-filled sails That waft the missioned men, who have renounced Their homes, their country, nay, almost the world, Bearing glad tidings to the farthest isles Of ocean, that the dead shall rise again. Forward the gleam-girt castle coastwise glides. It seems as it would pass away. To cry The wretched man in vain attempts, in vain, Powerless his voice as in a fearful dream: Not so his hand; he strikes the flint,—a blaze Mounts from the ready heap of withered leaves: The music ceases; accents harsh succeed, Harsh, but most grateful: downward drop the sails; Ingulphed the anchor sinks; the boat is launched; But cautious lies aloof till morning dawn: O then the transport of the man, unused To other human voice beside his own,— His native tongue to hear! he breathes at home, Though earth's diameter is interposed. Of perils of the sea he has no dread, Full well assured the missioned bark is safe, Whenever the sea is gently agitated, it seems converted into little stars; every drop as it breaks emits light, like bodies electrified in the dark.”—Darwin. Held in the hollow of the Almighty's hand. (And signal thy deliverances have been Of these thy messengers of peace and joy.) From storms that loudly threaten to unfix Islands rock-rooted in the ocean's bed, Thou dost deliver them,—and from the calm, More dreadful than the storm, when motionless Upon the purple deep the vessel lies For days, for nights, illumed by phosphor lamps; When sea-birds seem in nests of flame to float; When backward starts the boldest mariner To see, while o'er the side he leans, his face As if deep-tinged with blood.— Let worldly men The cause and combatants contemptuous scorn, And call fanatics them, who hazard health And life, in testifying of the truth, Who joy and glory in the cross of Christ! What were the Galilean fishermen But messengers, commissioned to announce The resurrection, and the life to come! They too, though clothed with power of mighty works Miraculous, were oft received with scorn; Oft did their words fall powerless, though enforced By deeds that marked Omnipotence their friend: But, when their efforts failed, unweariedly They onward went, rejoicing in their course. Like helianthus, Sun flower. “The seeds of many plants of this kind are furnished with a plume, by which admirable mechanism they are disseminated far from their parent stem.”—Darwin. borne on downy wings To distant realms, they frequent fell on soils Barren and thankless; yet oft-times they saw Their labours crowned with fruit an hundred fold, Saw the new converts testify their faith By works of love,—the slave set tree, the sick Attended, prisoners visited, the poor Received as brothers at the rich man's board. Alas! how different now the deeds of men Nursed in the faith of Christ!—the free made slaves! Stolen from their country, borne across the deep, Enchained, endungeoned, forced by stripes to live, Doomed to behold their wives, their little ones, Trembles beneath the white man's fiend-like frown! Yet even to scenes like these, the Sabbath brings Alleviation of the enormous woe:— The oft-reiterated stroke is still; The clotted scourge hangs hardening in the shrouds. But see, the demon man, whose trade is blood, With dauntless front, convene his ruffian crew, To hear the sacred service read. Accursed, The wretch's bile-tinged lips profane the word Of God: Accursed, he ventures to pronounce The decalogue, nor faulters at that law, Wherein 'tis written, Thou shalt do no murder; Perhaps, while yet the words are on his lips, He hears a dying mother's parting groan; He hears her orphan'd child, with lisping plaint, Attempt to rouse her from the sleep of death. O England! England! wash thy purpled hands Of this foul sin, and never dip them more In guilt so damnable! then lift them up In supplication to that God, whose name Is Mercy; then thou may'st, without the risk Of drawing vengeance from the surcharged clouds, Implore protection to thy menaced shores; Then, God will blast the tyrant's arm that grasps The thunderbolt of ruin o'er thy head; Then, will he turn the wolvish race to prey Upon each other; then, will he arrest The lava torrent, causing it regorge Back to its source with fiery desolation. Of all the murderous trades by mortals plied, 'Tis War alone that never violates The hallowed day by simulate respect,— By hypocritic rest: No, no, the work proceeds. From sacred pinnacles are hung the flags, Church steeples are frequently used as signal-posts. That give the sign to slip the leash from slaughter. The bells, whose knoll a holy calmness poured Into the good man's breast,—whose sound solaced The sick, the poor, the old—perversion dire— Pealing with sulphurous tongue, speak death-fraught words: From morn to eve Destruction revels frenzied, Till at the hour when peaceful vesper-chimes Were wont to sooth the ear, the trumpet sounds Pursuit and flight altern; and for the song Of larks, descending to their grass-bowered homes, The croak of flesh-gorged ravens, as they slake Their thirst in hoof-prints filled with gore, disturbs The stupor of the dying man: while Death Triumphantly sails down the ensanguined stream, On corses throned, and crowned with shivered boughs, That erst hung imaged in the crystal tide. After a heavy cannonade, the shivered branches of trees, and the corpses of the killed, are seen floating together down the rivers. And what the harvest of these bloody fields? A double weight of fetters to the slave, And chains on arms that wielded Freedom's sword. Spirit of Tell! and art thou doomed to see Thy mountains, that confessed no other chains Than what the wintry elements had forged,— Thy vales, where Freedom, and her stern compeer, Proud virtuous Poverty, their noble state Maintained, amid surrounding threats of wealth, Of superstition, and tyrannic sway— Spirit of Tell! and art thou doomed to see That land subdued by Slavery's basest slaves; By men, whose lips pronounce the sacred name Of Liberty, then kiss the despot's foot? Helvetia! hadst thou to thyself been true, Thy dying sons had triumphed as they fell: But 'twas a glorious effort, though in vain. Aloft thy Genius, 'mid the sweeping clouds, The flag of Freedom spread; bright in the storm The streaming meteor waved, and far it gleamed; But, ah! 'twas transient as the Iris' arch, Glanced from Leviathan's ascending shower, When mid the mountain waves heaving his head. Already had the friendly-seeming foe Possessed the snow-piled ramparts of the land; Down like an avalanche they rolled, they crushed The temple, palace, cottage, every work Of art and nature, in one common ruin. The dreadful crush is o'er, and peace ensues,— The peace of desolation, gloomy, still: Each day is hushed as Sabbath; but, alas! No Sabbath-service glads the seventh day! No more the happy villagers are seen, Winding adown the rock-hewn paths, that wont To lead their footsteps to the house of prayer; But, far apart, assembled in the depth Of solitudes, perhaps a little groupe Of aged men, and orphan boys, and maids Bereft, list to the breathings of the holy man, Who spurns an oath of fealty to the power Of rulers chosen by a tyrant's nod. No more, as dies the rustling of the breeze, Is heard the distant vesper-hymn; no more At gloamin hour, the plaintive strain, that links His country to the Switzer's heart, delights The loosening team; or if some shepherd boy Attempt the strain, his voice soon faultering stops; He feels his country now a foreign land. O, Scotland! canst thou for a moment brook The mere imagination, that a fate Like this should e'er be thine! that o'er those hills, And dear-bought vales, whence Wallace, Douglas, Bruce, Repelled proud Edward's multitudinous hordes, A Gallic foe, that abject race, should rule! No, no! let never hostile standard touch Thy shore: rush, rush into the dashing brine, And crest each wave with steel; and should the stamp Of Slavery's footstep violate the strand, Let not the tardy tide efface the mark; Sweet off the stigma with a sea of blood! Thrice happy he who, far in Scottish glen Retired (yet ready at his country's call,) Has left the restless emmet-hill of man! He never longs to read the saddening tale Of endless wars; and seldom does he hear The tale of woe; and ere it reaches him, Rumour, so loud when new, has died away Into a whisper, on the memory borne Of casual traveller;—As on the deep, Far from the sight of land, when all around Is waveless calm, the sudden tremulous swell, That gently heaves the ship, tells, as it rolls, Of earthquakes dread, and cities overthrown. O Scotland! much I love thy tranquil dales; But most on Sabbath eve, when low the sun Slants through the upland copse, 'tis my delight, Wandering, and stopping oft, to hear the song Of kindred praise arise from humble roofs; Or, when the simple service ends, to hear The lifted latch, and mark the grey-haired man, The father and the priest, walk forth alone Into his garden-plat, or little field, To commune with his God in secret prayer,— To bless the Lord, that in his downward years His children are about him: Sweet, meantime, The thrush, that sings upon the aged thorn, Brings to his view the days of youthful years, When that same aged thorn was but a bush. Nor is the contrast between youth and age To him a painful thought; he joys to think His journey near a close,—heaven is his home. More happy far that man, though bowed down, Though feeble be his gait, and dim his eye, Than they, the favourites of youth and health, Of riches, and of fame, who have renounced The glorious promise of the life to come,— Clinging to death. Or mark that female face, The faded picture of its former self,— The garments coarse, but clean;—frequent at church I've noted such a one, feeble and pale, Yet standing, with a look of mild content, Till beckoned by some kindly hand to sit. She has seen better days; there was a time, Her hands could earn her bread, and freely give To those who were in want; but now old age, And lingering disease, have made her helpless. Yet is she happy, aye, and she is wise, (Philosophers may sneer, and pedants frown,) Although her Bible is her only book; And she is rich, although her only wealth Is recollection of a well spent life— Is expectation of the life to come. Examine here, explore the narrow path In which she walks; look not for virtuous deeds In history's arena, where the prize Of fame, or power, prompts to heroic acts. Peruse the lives themselves of men obscure:— There charity, that robs itself to give; There fortitude in sickness, nursed by want; There courage, that expects no tongue to praise; There virtue lurks, like purest gold deep hid, With no alloy of selfish motive mixed. The poor man's boon, that stints him of his bread, Is prized more highly in the sight of Him, Who sees the heart, than golden gifts from hands That scarce can know their countless treasures less: “And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury; and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.”—Mark, xii. 41.—44. Yea, the deep sigh that heaves the poor man's breast To see distress, and feel his willing arm Palsied by penury, ascends to heaven; While ponderous bequests of lands and goods Ne'er rise above their earthly origin. And should all bounty, that is clothed with power, Be deemed unworthy?—Far be such a thought! Even when the rich bestow, there are sure tests Of genuine charity: Yes, yes, let wealth Give other alms than silver or than gold,— Time, trouble, toil, attendance, watchfulness, Exposure to disease;—yes, let the rich Be often seen beneath the sick man's roof; Or cheering, with inquiries from the heart, And hopes of health, the melancholy range Of couches in the public wards of woe: There let them often bless the sick man's bed, With kind assurances that all is well At home; that plenty smiles upon the board,— The while the hand, that earned the frugal meal, Can hardly raise itself in sign of thanks. Above all duties, let the rich man search Into the cause he knoweth not, nor spurn The suppliant wretch as guilty of a crime. Ye blessed with wealth! (another name for power Of doing good) O would ye but devote A little portion of each seventh day, To acts of justice to your fellow men! The house of mourning silently invites: Shun not the crowded alley; prompt descend Into the half-sunk cell, darksome and damp; Nor seem impatient to begone: Inquire, Console, instruct, encourage, sooth, assist; Read, pray, and sing a new song to the Lord; Make tears of joy down grief-worn furrows flow. O Health! thou sun of life, without whose beam The fairest scenes of nature seem involved In darkness, shine upon my dreary path Once more; or, with thy faintest dawn, give hope, That I may yet enjoy thy vital ray! Though transient be the hope, 'twill be most sweet, Like midnight music, stealing on the ear, Then gliding past, and dying slow away. Music! thou soothing power, thy charm is proved Most vividly when clouds o'ercast the soul;— So light its loveliest effect displays In lowering skies, when through the murky rack A slanting sun-beam shoots, and instant limns The etherial curve of seven harmonious dyes, Eliciting a splendour from the gloom: O Music! still vouchsafe to tranquillize This breast perturbed; thy voice, though mournful, soothes; And mournful ay are thy most beauteous lays, Like fall of blossoms from the orchard boughs,— The autumn of the spring. Enchanting power! Who, by thy airy spell, canst whirl the mind Far from the busy haunts of men to vales Where Tweed or Yarrow flows; or, spurning time, Recall red Flodden field; or suddenly Transport, with altered strain, the deafened ear To Linden's plain!—But what the pastoral lay, The melting dirge, the battle's trumpet-peal, Compared to notes with sacred numbers linked In union, solemn, grand! O then the spirit, Upborne on pinions of celestial sound, Soars to the throne of God, and ravished hears Ten thousand times ten thousand voices rise In halleluias,—voices, that erewhile Were feebly tuned perhaps to low-breathed hymns Of solace in the chambers of the poor,— The Sabbath worship of the friendless sick. Blest be the female votaries, whose days No Sabbath of their pious labours prove, Whose lives are consecrated to the toil Of ministering around the uncurtained couch Of pain and poverty! Blest be the hands, The lovely hands, (for beauty, youth, and grace, Are oft concealed by Pity's closest veil,) That mix the cup medicinal, that bind The wounds, which ruthless warfare and disease Have to the loathsome lazar-house consigned. Fierce Superstition of the mitred king! Almost I could forget thy torch and stake, When I this blessed sisterhood survey,— Compassion's priestesses, disciples true Of Him, whose touch was health, whose single word Electrified with life the palsied arm,— Of him, who said, Take up thy bed, and walk,— Of him, who cried to Lazarus, Come forth. And he who cried to Lazarus, Come forth, Will, when the Sabbath of the tomb is past, Call forth the dead, and re-unite the dust (Transformed and purified) to angel souls. Extatic hope! belief! conviction firm! How grateful 'tis to recollect the time When hope arose to faith! Faintly, at first, The heavenly voice is heard: Then, by degrees, Its music sounds perpetual in the heart. Thus he, who all the gloomy winter long Has dwelt in city-crowds, wandering afield Betimes on Sabbath morn, ere yet the spring Unfold the daisy's bud, delighted hears The first lark's note, faint yet, and short the song, Checked by the chill ungenial northern breeze; But, as the sun ascends, another springs, And still another soars on loftier wing, Till all o'erhead, the joyous choir, unseen, Poised welkin high, harmonious fills the air, As if it were a link 'tween earth and heaven. SABBATH WALKS. A SPRING SABBATH WALK. Most earnest was his voice! most mild his look, As with raised hands he blessed his parting flock. He is a faithful pastor of the poor;— He thinks not of himself; his Master's words, Feed, feed my sheep, “So when he had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.”—John, xxi. 15—17. are ever at his heart, The cross of Christ is ay before his eyes. O, how I love, with melted soul, to leave The house of prayer, and wander in the fields Alone! What tho' the opening spring be chill! Altho' the lark, checked in his airy path, Eke out his song, perched on the fallow clod, That still o'ertops the blade! Altho' no branch Have spread its foliage, save the willow wand, That dips its pale leaves in the swollen stream! What tho' the clouds oft lower! Their threats but end In sunny showers, that scarcely fill the folds Of moss-couched violet, or interrupt The merle's dulcet pipe,—melodious bird! He, hid behind the milk-white sloe-thorn spray, (Whose early flowers anticipate the leaf,) Welcomes the time of buds, the infant year. Sweet is the sunny nook, to which my steps Have brought me, hardly conscious where I roamed, Unheeding where,—so lovely all around, The works of God, arrayed in vernal smile! Oft at this season, musing, I prolong My devious range, till, sunk from view, the sun Emblaze, with upward-slanting ray, the breast, And wing unquivering of the wheeling lark, Descending, vocal, from her latest flight, While, disregardful of yon lonely star,— The harbinger of chill night's glittering host,— Sweet Redbreast, Scotia's Philomela, chaunts, In desultory strains, his evening hymn. A SUMMER SABBATH WALK. Delightful is this loneliness; it calms My heart: pleasant the cool beneath these elms, That throw across the stream a moveless shade. Here nature in her midnoon whisper speaks: How peaceful every sound!—the ring-dove's plaint, Moaned from the twilight centre of the grove, While every other woodland lay is mute, Save when the wren flits from her down-coved nest, And from the root-sprigs trills her ditty clear,— The grashopper's oft-pausing chirp,—the buzz, Angrily shrill, of moss-entangled bee, That, soon as loosed, booms with full twang away,— The sudden rushing of the minnow shoal, Scared from the shallows by my passing tread. Dimpling the water glides, with here and there A glossy fly, skimming in circlets gay The treacherous surface, while the quick-eyed trout Watches his time to spring; or, from above, Some feathered dam, purveying 'mong the boughs, Darts from her perch, and to her plumeless brood Bears off the prize:—Sad emblem of man's lot! He, giddy insect, from his native leaf, (Where safe and happily he might have lurked) Elate upon ambition's gaudy wings, Forgetful of his origin, and, worse, Unthinking of his end, flies to the stream; And if from hostile vigilance he 'scape, Buoyant he flutters but a little while, Mistakes the inverted image of the sky For heaven itself, and, sinking, meets his fate. Now, let me trace the stream up to its source Among the hills; its runnel by degrees Diminishing, the murmur turns a tinkle. Closer and closer still the banks approach, Tangled so thick with pleaching bramble-shoots, With brier, and hazel branch, and hawthorn spray, That, fain to quit the dingle, glad I mount Into the open air: Grateful the breeze That fans my throbbing temples! smiles the plain Spread wide below: how sweet the placid view! But, O! more sweet the thought, heart-soothing thought, That thousands, and ten thousands of the sons Of toil, partake this day the common joy Of rest, of peace, of viewing hill and dale, Of breathing in the silence of the woods, And blessing Him, who gave the Sabbath day. Yes, my heart flutters with a freer throb, To think that now the townsman wanders forth Among the fields and meadows, to enjoy The coolness of the day's decline; to see His children sport around, and simply pull The flower and weed promiscuous, as a boon, Which proudly in his breast they smiling fix. Again I turn me to the hill, and trace The wizard stream, now scarce to be discerned; Woodless its banks, but green with ferny leaves, And thinly strewed with heath-bells up and down. Now, when the downward sun has left the glens, Each mountain's rugged lineaments are traced Upon the adverse slope, where stalks gigantic The shepherd's shadow thrown athwart the chasm, As on the topmost ridge he homeward hies. How deep the hush! the torrent's channel, dry, Presents a stony steep, the echo's haunt. But hark, a plaintive sound floating along! 'Tis from yon heath-roofed shielin; now it dies Away, now rises full; it is the song Which He,—who listens to the halleluiahs Of choiring Seraphim—delights to hear; It is the music of the heart, the voice Of venerable age,—of guileless youth, In kindly circle seated on the ground Before their wicker door: Behold the man! The grandsire and the saint; his silvery locks Beam in the parting ray; before him lies, Upon the smooth-cropt sward, the open book, His comfort, stay, and ever new-delight; While, heedless, at a side, the lisping boy Fondles the lamb that nightly shares his couch. AN AUTUMN SABBATH WALK. When homeward bands their several ways disperse, I love to linger in the narrow field Of rest, to wander round from tomb to tomb, And think of some who silent sleep below. Sad sighs the wind, that from these ancient elms Shakes showers of leaves upon the withered grass: The sere and yellow wreaths, with eddying sweep, Fill up the furrows 'tween the hillocked graves. But list that moan! 'tis the poor blind man's dog, His guide for many a day, now come to mourn The master and the friend—conjunction rare! A man, indeed, he was of gentle soul, Though bred to brave the deep: the lightning's flash Had dimmed, not closed, his mild, but sightless eyes. He was a welcome guest through all his range; (It was not wide:) no dog would bay at him: Children would run to meet him on his way, And lead him to a sunny seat, and climb His knee, and wonder at his oft-told tales. Then would he teach the elfins how to plait The rushy cap and crown, or sedgy ship: And I have seen him lay his tremulous hand Upon their heads, while silent moved his lips. Peace to thy spirit! that now looks on me, Perhaps with greater pity than I felt To see thee wandering darkling on thy way. But let me quit this melancholy spot, And roam where nature gives a parting smile. As yet the blue-bells linger on the sod That copes the sheepfold ring; and in the woods A second blow of many flowers appears, Flowers faintly tinged, and breathing no perfume. But fruits, not blossoms, form the woodland wreath, That circles Autumn's brow: The ruddy haws Now clothe the half-leaved thorn; the bramble bends Beneath its jetty load; the hazel hangs With auburn bunches, dipping in the stream That sweeps along, and threatens to o'erflow The leaf-strewn banks: Oft, statue-like, I gaze, In vacancy of thought, upon that stream, And chace, with dreaming eye, the eddying foam, Or rowan's clustered branch, or harvest sheaf, Borne rapidly adown the dizzying flood. A WINTER SABBATH WALK. How dazzling white the snowy scene! deep, deep The stillness of the winter Sabbath day,— Not even a foot-fall heard. Smooth are the fields, Each hollow pathway level with the plain: Hid are the bushes, save that here and there Are seen the topmost shoots of brier or broom. High-ridged, the whirled drift has almost reached The powdered key-stone of the church-yard porch. Mute hangs the hooded-bell; the tombs lie buried; No step approaches to the house of prayer. The flickering fall is o'er: the clouds disperse, And shew the sun, hung o'er the welkin's verge, Shooting a bright but ineffectual beam On all the sparkling waste. Now is the time To visit nature in her grand attire; Though perilous the mountainous ascent, A noble recompense the danger brings. How beautiful the plain stretched far below! Unvaried though it be, save by yon stream With azure windings, or the leafless wood. But what the beauty of the plain, compared To that sublimity which reigns enthroned, Holding joint rule with solitude divine, Among yon rocky fells, that bid defiance To steps the most adventurously bold! There silence dwells profound; or if the cry Of high-poised eagle break at times the hush, The mantled echoes no response return. But let me now explore the deep sunk dell. No foot-print, save the covey's or the flock's, Is seen along the rill, where marshy springs Still rear the grassy blade of vivid green. Beware, ye shepherds, of these treacherous haunts, Nor linger there too long: the wintry day Soon closes; and full oft a heavier fall, Heaped by the blast, fills up the sheltered glen, While, gurgling deep below, the buried rill Mines for itself a snow-coved way. O, then, Your helpless charge drive from the tempting spot, And keep them on the bleak hill's stormy side, Where night winds sweep the gathering drift away:— —So the great Shepherd leads the heavenly flock From faithless pleasures, full into the storms Of life, where long they bear the bitter blast, Until at length the vernal sun looks forth, Bedimmed with showers: Then to the pastures green He brings them, where the quiet waters glide, The streams of life, the Siloah of the soul. BIBLICAL PICTURES. THE FIRST SABBATH. Six days the heavenly host, in circle vast, Like that untouching cincture which enzones The globe of Saturn, compassed wide this orb, And with the forming mass floated along, In rapid course, through yet untravelled space, Beholding God's stupendous power,—a world Bursting from Chaos at the omnific will, And perfect ere the sixth day's evening star On Paradise arose. Blessod that eve! The Sabbath's harbinger, when, all complete, In freshest beauty from Jehovah's hand, Creation bloomed; when Eden's twilight face Smiled like a sleeping babe: The voice divine A holy calm breathed o'er the goodly work: Mildly the sun, upon the loftiest trees, Shed mellowly a sloping beam. Peace reigned, And love, and gratitude: The human pair Their orisons poured forth: love, concord, reigned: The falcon, perched upon the blooming bough With Philomela, listened to her lay; Among the antlered herd the tiger couched, Harmless; the lion's mane no terror spread Among the careless ruminating flock. Silence was o'er the deep; the noiseless surge, The last subsiding wave,—of that dread tumult Which raged, when Ocean, at the mute command, Rushed furiously into his new-cleft bed,— Was gently rippling on the pebbled shore; While, on the swell, the sea-bird, with her head Wing-veiled, slept tranquilly. The host of heaven, Entranced in new delight, speechless adored; Nor stopped their fleet career, nor changed their form Encircular, till on that hemisphere,— In which the blissful garden sweet exhaled Its incense, odorous clouds,—the Sabbath dawn Arose; then wide the flying circle oped, And soared, in semblance of a mighty rainbow: Silent ascend the choirs of Seraphim; No harp resounds, mute is each voice; the burst Of joy, and praise, reluctant they repress,— For love and concord all things so attuned To harmony, that Earth must have received The grand vibration, and to the centre shook: But soon as to the starry altitudes They reached, then what a storm of sound, tremendous, Swelled through the realms of space! The morning stars Together sang, and all the sons of God Shouted for joy! Loud was the peal; so loud, As would have quite o'erwhelmed the human sense; But to the Earth it came a gentle strain, Like softest fall breathed from Æolian lute, When 'mid the chords the evening gale expires. Day of the Lord! creation's hallowed close! Day of the Lord! (prophetical they sang) Benignant mitigation of that doom, Which must, ere long, consign the fallen race, Dwellers in yonder star, to toil and woe! THE FINDING OF MOSES. Slow glides the Nile: amid the margin flags, Closed in a bulrush ark, the babe is left, Left by a mother's hand. His sister waits Far off; and pale, 'tween hope and fear, beholds The royal maid, surrounded by her train, Approach the river bank; approach the spot Where sleeps the innocent: She sees them stoop With meeting plumes; the rushy lid is oped, And wakes the infant, smiling in his tears,— As when along a little mountain lake, The summer south-wind breathes with gentle sigh, And parts the reeds, unveiling, as they bend, A water-lily floating on the wave. JACOB AND PHARAOH. Pharaoh, upon a gorgeous throne of state Was seated; while around him stood submiss His servants, watchful of his lofty looks. The Patriarch enters, leaning on the arm Of Benjamin. Unmoved by all the glare Of royalty, he scarcely throws a glance Upon the pageant show; for from his youth A shepherd's life he led, and viewed each night The starry host; and still where'er he went He felt himself in presence of the Lord. His eye is bent on Joseph, him pursues. Sudden the king descends; and, bending, kneels Before the aged man, and supplicates A blessing from his lips: the aged man Lays on the ground his staff, and, stretching forth His tremulous hand o'er Pharaoh's uncrowned head, Prays that the Lord would bless him and his land. JEPHTHA'S VOW. From conquest Jephtha came, with faultering step, And troubled eye: His home appears in view; He trembles at the sight. Sad he forebodes,— His vow will meet a victim in his child: For well he knows, that, from her earliest years, She still was first to meet his homeward steps: Well he remembers, how, with tottering gait, She ran, and clasped his knees, and lisped, and looked Her joy; and how, when garlanding with flowers His helm, fearful, her infant hand would shrink Back from the lion couched beneath the crest. What sound is that, which, from the palm-tree grove, Floats now with choral swell, now fainter falls Upon the ear? It is, it is the song He loved to hear,—a song of thanks and praise, Sung by the patriarch for his ransomed son. Hope from the omen springs: O, blessed hope! It may not be her voice!—Fain would he think 'Twas not his daughter's voice, that still approached, Blent with the timbrel's note. Forth from the grove She foremost glides of all the minstrel band: Moveless he stands; then grasps his hilt, still red With hostile gore, but, shuddering, quits the hold; And clasps, in agony, his hands, and cries, “Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me low.”— The timbrel at her rooted feet resounds. SAUL AND DAVID. Deep was the furrow in the royal brow, When David's hand, lightly as vernal gales Rippling the brook of Kedron, skimmed the lyre: He sung of Jacob's youngest born,—the child Of his old age,—sold to the Ishmaelite; His exaltation to the second power In Pharaoh's realm; his brethren thither sent; Suppliant they stood before his face, well known, Unknowing,—till Joseph fell upon the neck Of Benjamin, his mother's son, and wept. Unconsciously the warlike shepherd paused; But when he saw, down the yet-quivering string, The tear-drop trembling glide, abashed, he checked, Indignant at himself, the bursting flood, And, with a sweep impetuous, struck the chords: From side to side his hands transversely glance, Like lightning thwart a stormy sea; his voice Arises 'mid the clang, and straightway calms The harmonious tempest, to a solemn swell Majestical, triumphant; for he sings Of Arad's mighty host by Israel's arm Subdued; of Israel through the desart led, He sings; of him who was their leader, called, By God himself, from keeping Jethro's flock, To be a ruler o'er the chosen race. Kindles the eye of Saul; his arm is poised;— Harmless the javelin quivers in the wall. ELIJAH FED BY RAVENS. Sore was the famine throughout all the bounds Of Israel, when Elijah, by command Of God, journeyed to Cherith's failing brook. No rain-drops fall, no dew-fraught cloud, at morn, Or closing eve, creeps slowly up the vale; The withering herbage dies; among the palms, The shrivelled leaves send to the summer gale An Autumn rustle; no sweet songster's lay Is warbled from the branches; scarce is heard The rill's faint brawl. The prophet looks around, And trusts in God, and lays his silvered head Upon the flowerless bank; serene he sleeps, Nor wakes till dawning: Then, with hands enclasped, And heavenward face, and eyelids closed, he prays To Him who manna on the desart showered, To Him who from the rock made fountains gush: Entranced the man of God remains; till roused By sound of wheeling wings, with grateful heart, He sees the ravens fearless by his side Alight, and leave the heaven-provided food. THE BIRTH OF JESUS ANNOUNCED. Deep was the midnight silence in the fields Of Bethlehem; hushed the folds; save that, at times Was heard the lamb's faint bleat: the shepherds, stretched On the green sward, surveyed the starry vault: The heavens declare the glory of the Lord, The firmament shews forth thy handy work; Thus they, their hearts attuned to the Most High;— When, suddenly, a splendid cloud appeared, As if a portion of the milky way Descended slowly in a spiral course. Near, and more near it draws; then, hovering, floats, High as the soar of eagle, shedding bright, Upon the folded flocks, a heavenly radiance, From whence was uttered loud, yet sweet, a voice,— Fear not, I bring good tidings of great joy; For unto you is born this day a Saviour! And this shall be a sign to you,—the babe, Laid lowly in a manger, ye shall find. The angel spake; when, lo! upon the cloud, A multitude of Seraphim, enthroned, Sang praises, saying,—Glory to the Lord On high; on earth be peace, good will to men. With sweet response harmoniously they choired, And while, with heavenly harmony, the song Arose to God, more bright the buoyant throne Illumed the land: The prowling lion stops, Awe-struck, with mane upreared, and flattened head; And, without turning, backward on his steps Recoils, aghast, into the desart gloom. A trembling joy the astonished shepherds prove, As heavenward re-ascends the vocal blaze Triumphantly; while, by degrees, the strain Dies on the ear, that self-deluded listens,— As if a sound so sweet could never die. BEHOLD MY MOTHER AND MY BRETHREN. Who is my mother, or my brethren?— He spake, and looked on them who sat around, With a meek smile, of pity blent with love, More melting than e'er gleamed from human face,— As when a sun-beam, through a summer shower, Shines mildly on a little hill-side flock; And with that look of love, he said, Behold My mother, and my brethren: for I say, That whosoe'er shall do the will of God, He is my brother, sister, mother, all. BARTIMEUS RESTORED TO SIGHT. Blind, poor, and helpless, Bartimeus sate, Listening the foot of the wayfaring man, Still hoping that the next, and still the next, Would put an alms into his trembling hand. He thinks he hears the coming breeze faint rustle Among the sycamores; it is the tread Of thousand steps; it is the hum of tongues Innumerable: But when the sightless man Heard that the Nazarene was passing by, He cried, and said,—“Jesus, thou son of David, Have mercy upon me!” and, when rebuked, He cried the more, “Have mercy upon me.” Thy faith hath made thee whole; so Jesus spake, And straight the blind beheld the face of God. LITTLE CHILDREN BROUGHT TO JESUS. Suffer that little children come to me, Forbid them not. Emboldened by his words, The mothers onward press; but, finding vain The attempt to reach the Lord, they trust their babes To strangers' hands: The innocents, alarmed Amid the throng of faces all unknown, Shrink, trembling,—till their wandering eyes discern The countenance of Jesus, beaming love And pity; eager then they stretch their arms, And, cowring, lay their heads upon his breast. JESUS CALMS THE TEMPEST. The roaring tumult of the billowed sea Awakes him not: high on the crested surge, Now heaved, his locks flow streaming in the blast; And, now descending, 'tween the sheltering waves, The falling tresses veil the face divine: Meek though that veil a momentary gleam, Benignant, shines; he dreams that he beholds The opening eyes,—that long hopeless had rolled In darkness,—look around bedimmed with tears Of joy; but, suddenly, the voice of fear Dispelled the happy vision: Awful he rose, Rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be thou still! and straight there was a calm, With terror-mingled gladness in their looks, The mariners exclaim,—What man is this, That even the wind and sea obey his voice! JESUS WALKS ON THE SEA, AND CALMS THE STORM. Loud blew the storm of night; the thwarting surge Dashed, boiling on the labouring bark: Dismay, From face to face reflected, spread around:— When, lo! upon a towering wave is seen The semblance of a foamy wreath, upright, Move onward to the ship: The helmsman starts, And quits his hold; the voyagers, appalled, Shrink from the fancied Spirit of the Flood: But when the voice of Jesus, with the storm Soft mingled, It is I, be not afraid, Fear fled, and joy lightened from eye to eye. Up he ascends, and, from the rolling side, Surveys the tumult of the sea and sky With transient look severe: The tempest, awed, Sinks to a sudden calm; the clouds disperse; The moon-beam trembles on the face divine, Reflected mildly in the unruffled deep. THE DUMB CURED. His eyes uplifted, and his hands close clasped, The dumb man, with a supplicating look, Turned, as the Lord passed by: Jesus beheld, And on him bent a pitying look, and spake: His moving lips are by the suppliant seen, And the last accents of the healing sentence Ring in that ear which never heard before. Prostrate the man restored falls to the earth, And uses first the gift, the gift sublime, Of speech, in giving thanks to him, whose voice Was never uttered but in doing good. THE DEATH OF JESUS. 'Tis finished: he spake the words, and bowed His head, and died.—Beholding him far off, They, who had ministered unto him, hope,— 'Tis his last agony: The Temple's vail Is rent; revealing the most holy place, Wherein the cherubims their wings extend, O'ershadowing the mercy-seat of God. Appalled, the leaning soldier feels the spear Shake in his grasp; the planted standard falls Upon the heaving ground: The sun is dimmed, And darkness shrouds the body of the Lord. THE RESURRECTION. The setting orb of night her level ray Shed o'er the land, and, on the dewy sward, The lengthened shadows of the triple cross Were laid far stretched,—when in the east arose, Last of the stars, day's harbinger: No sound Was heard, save of the watching soldier's foot: Within the rock-barred sepulchre, the gloom Of deepest midnight brooded o'er the dead, The holy one; but, lo! a radiance faint Began to dawn around his sacred brow: The linen vesture seemed a snowy weath, Drifted by storms into a mountain cave: Bright, and more bright, the circling halo beamed Upon that face, clothed in a smile benign, Though yet exanimate. Nor long the reign Of death; the eyes, that wept for human griefs, Unclose, and look around with conscious joy: Yes; with returning life, the first emotion That glowed in Jesus' breast of love, was joy At man's redemption, now complete; at death Disarmed; the grave transformed into the couch Of faith; the resurrection and the life. Majestical he rose; trembled the earth; The ponderous gate of stone was rolled away; The keepers fell; the angel, awe-struck, shrunk Into invisibility, while forth The Saviour of the World walked, and stood Before the sepulchre, and viewed the clouds Empurpled glorious by the rising sun. JESUS APPEARS TO THE DISCIPLES. The evening of that day, which saw the Lord Rise from the chambers of the dead, was come. His faithful followers, assembled, sang A hymn, low-breathed; a hymn of sorrow, blent With hope;—when, in the midst, sudden he stood. The awe-struck circle backward shrink; he looks Around with a benignant smile of love, And says, Peace be unto you: faith and joy Spread o'er each face, amazed:—as when the moon, Pavilioned in dark clouds, mildly comes forth, Silvering a circlet in the fleecy rack. PAUL ACCUSED BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE AREOPAGUS. Listen, that voice! upon the hill of Mars, Rolling in bolder thunders, than e'er pealed From lips that shook the Macedonian throne; Behold his dauntless outstretched arm, his face Illumed of heaven:—he knoweth not the fear Of man, of principalities, of powers. The Stoic's moveless frown; the vacant stare Of Epicurus' herd; the scowl and gnash malign Of Superstition, stopping both her ears; The Areopagite tribunal dread, From whence the doom of Socrates was uttered;— This hostile throng dismays him not; he seems, As if no worldly object could inspire A terror in his soul;—as if the vision, Which, when he journeyed to Damascus, shone From heaven, still swam before his eyes, Out-dazzling all things earthly; as if the voice, That spake from out the effulgence, ever rang Within his ear, inspiring him with words, Burning, majestic, lofty, as his theme,— The resurrection, and the life to come. PAUL ACCUSED BEFORE THE ROMAN GOVERNOR OF JUDEA. The Judge ascended to the judgment-seat. Amid a gleam of spears the Apostle stood. Dauntless, he forward came; and looked around, And raised his voice, at first, in accents low, Yet clear; a whisper spread among the throng:— So when the thunder mutters, still the breeze Is heard, at times, to sigh; but when the peal, Tremendous, louder rolls, a silence dead Succeeds each pause,—moveless the aspen leaf. Thus fixed, and motionless, the listening band Of soldiers forward leaned, as from the man, Inspired of God, truth's awful thunders rolled. No more he feels, upon his high raised arm, The ponderous chain, than does the playful child The bracelet, formed of many a flowery link. Heedless of self, forgetful that his life Is now to be defended by his words, He only thinks of doing good to them Who seek his life; and, while he reasons high Of justice, temperance, and the life to come, The Judge shrinks trembling at the prisoner's voice. THE RURAL CALENDAR. JANUARY. Long ere the snow-veiled dawn, the bird of morn His wings quick claps, and sounds his cheering call: The cottage hinds the glimmering lantern trim, And to the barn wade, sinking, in the drift; The alternate flails bounce from the loosened sheaf. Pleasant these sounds! they sleep to slumber change; Pleasant to him, whom no laborious task Whispers, arise!—whom neither love of gain, Nor love of power, nor hopes, nor fears, disturb. Late daylight comes at last, and the strained eye Shrinks from the dazzling brightness of the scene,— One wide expanse of whiteness uniform. As yet no wandering footstep has defaced The spotless plain, save where some wounded hare, Wrenched from the springe, has left a blood-stained track. How smooth are all the fields! sunk every fence; The furrow, here and there, heaped to a ridge, O'er which the sidelong plough-shaft scarcely peers. Cold blows the north-wind o'er the dreary waste.— O ye that shiver by your blazing fires, Think of the inmates of you hut, half sunk Beneath the drift: from it no smoke ascends; The broken straw-filled pane excludes the light, But ill excludes the blast: The redbreast there For shelter seeks, but short, ah! very short His stay; no crumbs, strewn careless on the floor, Attract his wistful glance;—to warmer roofs He flies; a welcome, soon a fearless guest, He cheers the winter day with summer songs. Short is the reign of day, tedious the night. The city's distant lights arrest my view, And magic fancy whirls me to the scene. There vice and folly run their giddy rounds; There eager crowds are hurrying to the sight Of feigned distress, yet have not time to hear The shivering orphan's prayer. The flaring lamps Of gilded chariots, like the meteor eyes Of mighty giants, famed in legends old, Illume the snowy street; the silent wheels On heedless passenger steal unperceived, Bearing the splendid fair to flutter round Amid the flowery labyrinths of the dance. But, hark! the merry catch: good social souls Sing on, and drown dull care in bumpers deep; The bell, snow-muffled, warns not of the hour; For scarce the sentenced felon's watchful ear Can catch the softened knell, by which he sums The hours he has to live. Poor hopeless wretch! His thoughts are horror, and his dreams despair; And ever as he, on his strawy couch, Turns heavily, his chains and fetters, grating, Awake the inmates of some neighbouring cell, Who bless their lot, that debt is all their crime. FEBRUARY. The treacherous fowler, in the drifted wreath, The snare conceals, and strews the husky lure, Tempting the famished fowls of heaven to light: They light; the captive strives in vain to fly, Scattering around, with fluttering wing, the snow. Amid the untrod snows, oft let me roam Far up the lonely glen, and mark its change; The frozen rill's hoarse murmur scarce is heard; The rocky cleft, the fairy bourne smoothed up, Repeat no more my solitary voice. Now to the icy plain the city swarms. In giddy circles, whirling variously, The skater fleetly thrids the mazy throng, While smaller wights the sliding pastime ply. Unhappy he, of poverty the child! Who, barefoot, standing, eyes his merry mates, And, shivering, weeps, not for the biting cold, But that he cannot join their slippery sport. Trust not incautiously the smooth expanse; For oft a treacherous thaw, ere yet perceived, Saps by degrees the solid-seeming mass: At last the long piled mountain snows dissolve, Bursting the roaring river's brittle bonds; The shattered fragments down the cataract shoot, And, sinking in the boiling deep below, At distance re-appear, then sweep along, Marking their height upon the half-sunk trees. No more the ploughman hurls the sounding quoit; The loosened glebe demands the rusted share, And slow the toiling team plods o'er the field. But oft, ere half the winding task be done, Returning frost again usurps the year, Fixing the ploughshare in the unfinished fur; And still, at times, the flaky shower descends, Whitening the plain, save where the wheaten blade Peering, uplifts its green and hardy head, As if just springing from a soil of snow. While yet the night is long, and drear, and chill, Soon as the slanting sun has sunk from view, The sounding anvil cheerily invites The weary hind to leave his twinkling fire, And bask himself before the furnace glare; Where, blest with unbought mirth, the rustic ring, Their faces tinted by the yellow blaze, Beguile the hours, nor envy rooms of state. MARCH. The ravaged fields, waste, colourless, and bleak, Retreating Winter leaves, with angry frown, And lingering on the distant snow-streaked hills, Displays the motley remnants of his reign. With shouldered spade, the labourer to the field Hies, joyful that the softened glebe gives leave To toil; no more his children cry for bread, Or, shivering, crowd around the scanty fire; No more he's doomed, reluctant, to receive The pittance, which the rich man proudly gives, Who, when he gives, thinks heaven itself obliged. Vain man! think not there's merit in the boon, If, quitting not one comfort, not one joy, The sparkling wine still circles round thy board, Thy hearth still blazes, and the sounding strings, Blent with the voice symphonious, charm thine ear. The redbreast now, at morn, resumes his song, And larks, high soaring, wing their spiral flight, While the light-hearted ploughboy singing, blythe, The broom, the bonny broom of Cowdenknows, Fills with delight the wandering townsman's ear; May be, though carolled rude in artless guise, Sad Flodden field, of Scotia's lays most sweet, Most mournful, dims, with starting tear, his eye. Nor silent are the upland leas; cheerily The partridge now her tuneless call repeats, Or, bursting unexpected from the brake, Startles the milkmaid singing o'er the ridge. Nor silent are the chilly leafless woods; The thrush's note is heard amid the grove, Soon as the primrose, from the withered leaves Smiling, looks out: Rash floweret! oft betrayed, By summer-seeming days, to venture forth Thy tender form,—the killing northern blast, Will wrap thee lifeless in a hoar-frost shroud. APRIL. Descend, sweet April, from yon watery bow, And, liberal, strew the ground with budding flowers, With leafless crocus, leaf-veiled violet, Auricula, with powdered cup, primrose That loves to lurk below the hawthorn shade. At thy approach health re-illumes the eye: Even pale Consumption, from thy balmy breath, Inhales delusive hope; and, dreaming still Of length of days, basks in some sunny plat, And decks her half-foreboding breast with flowers,— With flowers, which else would have survived the hand By which they're pulled. But they will bloom again: The daisy, spreading on the greensward grave, Fades, dies, and seems to perish, yet revives. Shall man for ever sleep? Cruel the tongue, That, with sophistic art, snatches from pain, Diseas, and grief and want, that antidote, Which makes the wretched smile, the hopeless hope. Light now the western gale sweeps o'er the plain; Gently it waves the rivulet's cascade; Gently it parts the lock on beauty's brow, And lifts the tresses from the snowy neck, And bends the flowers, and makes the lily stoop, As if to kiss its image in the wave; Or curls, with softest breath, the glassy pool, Aiding the treachery of the mimic fly; While, warily, behind the half-leaved bush, The angler screened, with keenest eye intent, Awaits the sudden rising of the trout: Down dips the feathery lure; the quivering rod Bends low; in vain the cheated captive strives To break the yielding line; exhausted soon, Ashore he's drawn, and, on the mossy bank Weltering, he dyes the primrose with his blood. MAY. On blythe May morning, when the lark's first note Ascends, on viewless wing, veiled in the mist, The village maids then hie them to the woods, To kiss the fresh dew from the daisy's brim; Wandering in misty glades they lose their way, And, ere aware, meet in their lovers' arms, Like joining dew-drops on the blushing rose. Sweet month! thy locks with bursting buds bedecked, With opening hyacinths, and hawthorn blooms, Fair still thou art, though showers bedim thine eye; The cloud soon quits thy brow, and, mild, the sun Looks out with watery beam, looks out, and smiles. Now, from the wild flower bank, the little bird Picks the soft moss, and to the thicket flies; And oft returns, and oft the work renews, Till all the curious fabric hangs complete: Alas! but ill concealed from schoolboy's eye, Who, heedless of the warbler's saddest plaint, Tears from the bush the toil of many an hour; Then, thoughtless wretch! pursues the devious bee, Buzzing from flower to flower: She wings her flight, Far from his following eye, to walled parterres, Where, undisturbed, she revels 'mid the beds Of full-blown lilies, doomed to die unculled, Save when the stooping fair (more beauteous flower!) The bosom's rival brightness half betrays, While chusing 'mong the gently bending stalks, The snowy hand a sister blossom seems. More sweet to me the lily's meekened grace Than gaudy hues, brilliant as summer clouds Around the sinking sun: to me more sweet Than garish day, the twilight's softened grace, When deepening shades obscure the dusky woods; Then comes the silence of the dewy hour, With songs of noontide birds, thrilling in fancy's ear, While from yon elm, with water-kissing boughs, Along the moveless winding of the brook, The smooth expanse is calmness, stillness all, Unless the springing trout, with quick replunge, Arousing meditation's downward look, Ruffle, with many a gently circling wave On wave, the glassy surface undulating far. JUNE. Short is the reign of night, and almost blends The evening twilight with the morning dawn. Mild hour of dawn! thy wide-spread solitude, And placid stillness, sooth even misery's sigh: Deep the distress that cannot feel thy charm!— As yet the thrush roosts on the bloomy spray, With head beneath his dew-besprinkled wing, When, roused by my lone tread, he lightly shakes His ruffling plumes, and chaunts the untaught note, Soon followed by the woodland choir, warbling Melodiously the oft-repeated song, Till noon-tide pour the torpor-shedding ray. Then is the hour to seek the sylvan bank Of lonely stream, remote from human haunt; To mark the wild bee voyaging, deep-toned, Low weighing down each floweret's tender stalk; To list the grashopper's hoarse creaking chirp; And then to let excursive fancy fly To scenes, where roaring cannon drown the straining voice, And fierce gesticulation takes the place Of useless words. May be some Alpine brook, That served to part two neighbouring shepherds' flocks, Is now the limit of two hostile camps. Weak limit! to be filled, ere evening star, With heaps of slain: Far down thy rocky course, The midnight wolf, lapping the gore-stained flood, Gluts his keen thirst, and oft, and oft returns, Unsated, to the purple, tepid stream. But let me fly such scenes, which, even when feigned, Distress. To Scotia's peaceful glens I turn, And rest my eyes upon her waving fields, Where now the scythe lays low the mingled flowers. Ah, spare, thou pitying swain! a ridge-breadth round The partridge nest; so shall no new-come lord— To ope a vista to some distant spire— Thy cottage raze; but, when the toilsome day Is done, still shall the turf-laid seat invite Thy weary limbs; there peace and health shall bless Thy frugal fare, served by the unhired hand, That seeks no wages save a parent's smile. Thus glides the eve, while round the strawy roof Is heard the bat's wing in the deep-hushed air, And from the little field the corncraik's harsh, Yet not unpleasing note, the stillness breaks, All the night long, till day-spring wake the lark. JULY. Slow move the sultry hours. O, for the shield Of darkening boughs, or hollow rock grotesque! The pool transparent to its pebbly bed, With here and there a slowly gliding trout, Invites the throbbing, half reluctant, breast To plunge: The dash re-echoes from the rocks, And smooth, in sinuous course, the swimmer winds, Now, with extended arms, rowing his way; And now, with sunward face, he floating lies; Till, blinded by the dazzling beam, he turns, Then to the bottom dives, emerging soon With stone, as trophy, in his waving hand: Blythe days of jocund youth, now almost flown! Meantime, far up the windings of the stream, Where birken witchknots o'er the channel meet, The sportive shriek, shrill, mingled with the laugh, The bushes hung with beauty's white attire, Tempt, yet forbid, the intrusive eye's approach. Unhappy he, who, in this season, pent Within the darksome gloom of city lane, Pines for the flowery paths, and woody shades, From which the love of lucre, or of power, Enticed his youthful steps. In vain he turns The rich descriptive page of Thomson's muse, And strives to fancy that the lovely scenes Are present: So the hand of childhood tries To grasp the pictured bunch of fruit, or flowers, But, disappointed, feels the canvas smooth: So the caged lark, upon a withering turf, Flutters from side to side, with quivering wings, As if in act of mounting to the skies. At noontide hour, from school, the little throng Rush gaily, sporting o'er the enamelled mead. Some strive to catch the bloom-perched butterfly; And if they miss his mealy wings, the flower, From which he flies, the disappointment sooths. Others, so pale in look, in tattered garb, Motley, with half-spun threads and cotton flakes, Trudge, drooping, to the many-storied pile, Where thousand spindles whirling stun the ear, Confused: There, prisoned close, they wretched moil. Sweet age, perverted from its proper end! When childhood toils, the field should be the scene,— To tend the sheep, or homeward drive the herd Or, from the corn-ridge, scare the pilfering rooks, Or to the mowers bear the milky pail. But, Commerce, Commerce, Manufactures, still Weary the ear; health, morals, all must yield To pamper the monopolising few, To make a wealthy, but a wretched state. Blest be the generous band, that would restore To honour due the long-neglected plough! From it expect peace, plenty, virtue, health: Compare with it, Britannia, all thine isles Beyond the Atlantic wave! thy trade! thy ships Deep-fraught with blood! But let me quit such themes! and, peaceful, roam The winding glen, where now the wild-rose pale And garish broom, strew, with their fading flowers, The narrow greenwood path. To me more sweet The greenwood path, half hid, 'neath brake and briar, Than pebbled walks so trim; more dear to me The daisied plat, before the cottage door, Than waveless sea of widely spreading lawn, 'Mid which some insulated mansion towers, Spurning the humble dwellings from its proud domain. AUGUST. Farewell, sweet summer, and thy fading flowers! Farewell, sweet summer, and thy woodland songs! No woodland note is heard, save where the hawk, High from her eyry, skims in circling flight, With all her clamorous young, first venturing forth On untried wing: At distance far, the sound Alarms the barn-door flock; the fearful dam Calls in her brood beneath her ruffling plumes; With crowding feet they stand, and frequent peep Through the half-opened wing. The partridge quakes Among the rustling corn. Ye gentle tribes, Think not your deadliest foe is now at hand. To man, bird, beast, man is the deadliest foe; 'Tis he who wages universal war. Soon as his murderous law gives leave to wound The heathfowl, dweller on the mountain wild, The sportsman, anxious, watching for the dawn, Lies turning, while his dog, in happy dreams, With feeble bark anticipates the day. Some, ere the dawn steals o'er the deep blue lake, The hill ascend: vain is their eager haste,— The dog's quick breath is heard panting around, But neither dog, nor springing game, is seen Amid the floating mist; short interval Of respite to the trembling dewy wing. Ah, many a bleeding wing, ere mid-day hour, Shall vainly flap the purple bending heath.— Fatigued, at noon, the spoiler seeks the shade Of some lone oak, fast by the rocky stream,— The hunter's rest, in days of other years, When sad the voice of Cona, in the gale, Lamentingly the song of Selma sung. How changeful, Caledonia, is thy clime! Where is the sun-beam that but now so bright Played on the dimpling brook? Dark o'er the heath A deepening gloom is hung; from clouds, high piled On clouds, glances the sudden flash; the thunder, Reverberated 'mong the cliffs, rolls far; Nor pause; but ere the echo of one peal Has ceased, another, louder still, the ear appals. The sporting lamb hastes to its mother's side; The shepherd stoops into the mountain-cave, At every momentary flash illumed Back to its innermost recess, where gleams The vaulted spar; the eagle, sudden smote, Falls to the ground lifeless; beneath the wave The sea-fowl plunges; fast the rain descends; The whitened streams, from every mountain side, Rush to the valley, tinging far the lake. SEPTEMBER. Gradual the woods their varied tints assume; The hawthorn reddens, and the rowan-tree Displays its ruby clusters, seeming sweet, Yet harsh, disfiguring the fairest face. At sultry hour of noon, the reaper band Rest from their toil, and in the lusty stook Their sickless hang. Around their simple fare, Upon the stubble spread, blythesome they form A circling groupe, while humbly waits behind The wistful dog, and with expressive look, And pawing foot, implores his little share. The short repast, seasoned with simple mirth, And not without the song, gives place to sleep. With sheaf beneath his head, the rustic youth Enjoys sweet slumbers, while the maid he loves Steals to his side, and screens him from the sun. But not by day alone the reapers toil: Oft in the moon's pale ray the sickle gleams, And heaps the dewy sheaf;—thy changeful sky, Poor Scotland, warns to seize the hour serene. The gleaners, wandering with the morning ray, Spread o'er the new-reaped field. Tottering old age, And lisping infancy, are there, and she Who better days has seen.— No shelter now The covey finds; but, hark! the murderous tube. Exultingly the deep-mouthed spaniel bears The fluttering victim to his master's foot: Perhaps another, wounded, flying far, Eludes the eager following eye, and drops Among the lonely furze, to pine and die. OCTOBER. With hound and horn, o'er moor, and hill, and dale, The chace sweeps on; no obstacle they heed, Nor hedge, nor ditch, nor wood, nor river wide. The clamorous pack rush rapid down the vale, Whilst o'er yon brushwood tops, at times, are seen The moving branches of the victim stag: Soon far beyond he stretches o'er the plain. O, may he safe elude the savage rout, And may the woods be left to peace again! Hushed are the faded woods; no song is heard, Save where the redbreast mourns the falling leaf. At close of shortened day, the reaper, tired, With sickle on his shoulder, homeward hies. Night comes with threatening storm, first whispering low, Sighing amid the boughs; then, by degrees, With violence redoubled at each pause, Furious it rages, scaring startled sleep. The river roars. Long-wished, at last, the dawn, Doubtful, peeps unsullied with a tear; Lights on the eyes unsullied with a tear; Nor flies, but at the plough-boy's whistle gay, Or hunter's horn, or sound of hedger's bill. Placid the sun shoots through the half-stript grove; The grove's sere leaves float down the dusky flood. The happy schoolboy, whom the swollen streams, Perilous to wight so small, give holiday, Forth roaming, now wild berries pulls, now paints, Artless, his rosy cheek with purple hue; Now wonders that the nest, hung in the leafless thorn, So full in view, escaped erewhile his search; On tiptoe raised,—ah, disappointment dire! His eager hand finds nought but withered leaves. Night comes again; the cloudless canopy Is one bright arch,—myriads, myriads of stars. To him who wanders 'mong the silent woods, The twinkling orbs beam through the leafless boughs, Which erst excluded the meridian ray. NOVEMBER. Languid the morning beam slants o'er the lea; The hoary grass, crisp, crackles 'neath the tread. On the haw-clustered thorns, a motley flock Of birds, of various plume, and various note, Discordant chirp; the linnet, and the thrush With speckled breast, the blackbird yellow-beaked, The goldfinch, fieldfare, with the sparrow, pert And clamorous above his shivering mates, While, on the house-top, faint the redbreast plains. Where do ye lurk, ye houseless commoners, When bleak November's sun is overcast; When sweeps the blast fierce through the deepest groves, Driving the fallen leaves in whirling wreaths; When scarce the raven keeps her bending perch; When dashing cataracts are backward blown? A deluge pours; loud comes the river down: The margin trees now insulated seem, As if they in the midway current grew. Oft let me stand upon the giddy brink, And chace, with following gaze, the whirling foam, Or woodland wreck: Ah me, that broken branch, Sweeping along, may tempt some heedless boy, Sent by his needy parents to the woods For brushwood gleanings for their evening fire, To stretch too far his little arm!—he falls, He sinks. Long is he looked for, oft he's called; His homeward whistle oft is fancied near: His playmates find him on the oozy bank, And, in his stiffened grasp, the fatal branch. Short is the day; dreary the boisterous night: At intervals the moon gleams through the clouds, And, now and then, a star is dimly seen. When daylight breaks, the woodman leaves his hut, And oft the axe's echoing stroke is heard; At last the yielding oak's loud crash resounds, Crushing the humble hawthorn in its fall. The husbandman slow plods from ridge to ridge, Disheartened, and rebuilds his prostrate sheaves. DECEMBER. Where late the wild flower bloomed, the brown leaf lies; Not even the snow-drop cheers the dreary plain: The famished birds forsake each leafless spray, And flock around the barn-yard's winnowing store. Season of social mirth! of fireside joys! I love thy shortened day, when, at its close, The blazing tapers, on the jovial board, Dispense o'er every care-forgetting face Their cheering light, and harmless mirth abounds. Now far be banished, from our social ring, The party wrangle fierce, the argument Deep, learned, metaphysical, and dull, Oft dropt, as oft again renewed, endless: Rather I'd hear stories twice ten times told, Or vapid joke, filched from Joe Miller's page, Or tale of ghost, hobgoblin dire, or witch; Nor would I, with a proud fastidious frown, Proscribe the laugh-provoking pun; absurd Although it be, and hard to be discerned, It serves the purpose, if it shake our sides. Now let the temperate cup inspire the song, The catch, the glee; or list! the melting lays Of Scotia's pastoral vales,—they ever please. Loud blows the blast; while, sheltered from its rage, The social circle feel their joys enhanced. Ah, little think they of the storm-tossed ship, Amid the uproar of the winds and waves, The waves unseen, save by the lightning's glare, Or cannon's flash, sad signal of distress. The trembling crew each moment think they feel The shock of sunken rock:—at last they strike: Borne on the blast, their dying voices reach, Faintly, the sea-girt hamlet; help is vain: The morning light discloses to the view The mast alternate seen and hid, as sinks Or heaves the surge. The early village maid Turns pale, like clouds when o'er the moon they glide; She thinks of her true love, far, far at sea; Mournful, the live long day she turns her wheel, And ever and anon her head she bends, While with the flax she dries the trickling tear. THE WILD DUCK AND HER BROOD. How calm that little lake! no breath of wind Sighs through the reeds; a clear abyss it seems Held in the concave of the inverted sky,— In which is seen the rook's dull flagging wing Move o'er the silvery clouds. How peaceful sails Yon little fleet, the wild duck and her brood! Fearless of harm, they row their easy way; The water-lily, 'neath the plumy prows, Dips, re-appearing in their dimpled track. Yet, even amid that scene of peace, the noise Of war, unequal, dastard war, intrudes. Yon revel rout of men, and boys, and dogs, Boisterous approach; the spaniel dashes in; Quick he descries the prey, and faster swims, And eager barks: the harmless flock, dismayed, Hasten to gain the thickest grove of reeds, All but the parent pair; they, floating, wait To lure the foe, and lead him from their young; But soon themselves are forced to seek the shore. Vain then the buoyant wing; the leaden storm Arrests their flight; they fluttering, bleeding fall, And tinge the troubled bosom of the lake. TO A REDBREAST, THAT FLEW IN AT MY WINDOW. From snowy plains, and icy sprays, From moonless nights, and sunless days, Welcome, poor bird! I'll cherish thee; I love thee, for thou trustest me. Thrice welcome, helpless, panting guest! Fondly I'll warm thee in my breast:— How quick thy little heart is beating! As if its brother flutterer greeting. Thou need'st not dread a captive's doom; No! freely flutter round my room; Perch on my lute's remaining string, And sweetly of sweet summer sing. That note, that summer note, I know; It wakes, at once, and soothes my woe,— I see those woods, I see that stream, I see,—ah, still prolong the dream! Still, with thy song, those scenes renew, Though through my tears they reach my view. No more now, at my lonely meal, While thou art by, alone I'll feel; For soon, devoid of all distrust, Thou'lt, nibbling, share my humble crust; Or on my finger, pert and spruce, Thou'lt learn to sip the sparkling juice; And when (our short collation o'er) Some favourite volume I explore, Be't work of poet or of sage, Safe thou shalt hop across the page; Unchecked, shalt flit o'er Virgil's groves, Or flutter 'mid Tibullus' loves. Thus, heedless of the raving blast, Thou'lt dwell with me till winter's past; And when the primrose tells 'tis spring, And when the thrush begins to sing, Soon as I hear the woodland song, Freed, thou shalt join the vocal throng. EPITAPH ON A BLACKBIRD, KILLED BY A HAWK. Winter was o'er, and spring-flowers decked the glade; The Blackbird's note among the wild woods rung: Ah, short-lived note! the songster now is laid Beneath the bush, on which so sweet he sung. Thy jetty plumes, by ruthless falcon rent, Are now all soiled among the mouldering clay; A primrosed turf is all thy monument, And, for thy dirge, the Redbreast lends his lay. THE POOR MAN'S FUNERAL. Yon motley, sable-suited throng, that wait Around the poor man's door, announce a tale Of woe; the husband, parent, is no more. Contending with disease, he laboured long, By penury compelled; yielding at last, He laid him down to die; but, lingering on From day to day, he, from his sickbed, saw, Heart-broken quite, his childrens' looks of want Veiled in a clouded smile; alas! he heard The elder, lispingly, attempt to still The younger's plaint,—languid he raised his head, And thought he yet could toil, but sunk Into the arms of death, the poor man's friend. The coffin is borne out; the humble pomp Moves slowly on; the orphan mourner's hand (Poor helpless child!) just reaches to the pall. And now they pass into the field of graves, And now around the narrow house they stand, And view the plain black board sink from the sight. Hollow the mansion of the dead resounds, As falls each spadeful of the bone-mixed mould. The turf is spread; uncovered is each head,— A last farewell: all turn their several ways. Woes me! those tear-dimmed eyes, that sobbing breast! Poor child! thou thinkest of the kindly hand That wont to lead thee home: no more that hand Shall aid thy feeble gait, or gently stroke Thy sun-bleached head, and downy cheek. But go, a mother waits thy homeward steps; In vain her eyes dwell on the sacred page,— Her thoughts are in the grave; 'tis thou alone, Her first-born child, canst rouse that statue gaze Of woe profound. Haste to the widowed arms; Look with thy father's look, speak with his voice, And melt a heart that else will break with grief. TO ENGLAND, ON THE SLAVE TRADE. Of all thy foreign crimes, from pole to pole, None moves such indignation in my soul, Such hate, such deep abhorrence, as thy trade In human beings! Thy ignorance thou dar'st to plead no more; The proofs have thundered from the Afric shore. Behold, behold, yon rows ranged over rows, Of dead with dying linked in death's last throes. Behold a single victim of despair, Dragged upon deck to gasp the ocean air; Devoid of fear, he hears the tempest rise,— The ship descending 'tween the waves, he eyes With eager hope; he thinks his woes shall end: Sunk in despair he sees her still ascend. What barbarous race are authors of his woe? With freights of fetters, who the vessel stow? Who forge the torture-irons, who plait the scourge? Whose navies shield the pirates o'er the surge? Who, from the mother's arms, the clinging child Tears? It is England,—merciful and mild! Most impious race, who brave the watery realm In blood-fraught barks, with Murder at the helm! Who trade in tortures, profit draw from pain, And even whose mercy is but love of gain! Whose human cargoes carefully are packt, By rule and square, according to the Act!— And is that gore-drenched flag by you unfurled, Champions of right, knights-errant of the world? “Yes, yes,” your Commons said, “Let such things be, “If others rob and murder, why not we?” In the smoothed speech, and in the upraised hand, I hear the lash, I hear the fierce command; Each guilty nay ten thousand crimes decreed, And English mercy said, Let millions bleed! SONG. [O lassie, will ye gang wi' me] Tune—Ettrick Banks. O lassie, will ye gang wi' me, And dwell amang yon hielan' hills;— Trim is my skiff, saft rows the sea, The summer breeze the sail scarce fills. The sea-bird on her white breast lights, And, floating trig, her feathers laves; Or on the wing, in wheeling flight, Darts at her image in the waves. The hielan' hills, though bare and bleak, Hae bonny glens and shaws between, Whare blooms the wild-rose like thy cheek, And bluebells like thy downcast een. What though nae houses, bien and braw Rise proudly on yon heathery braes,— A shielin is a lordly ha', If there wi' thee I pass my days. ANSWER. Yes, laddie, I will gang wi' thee; Wi' thee I'll trust the faithless main; Wi' thee I'll live, wi' thee I'll die, I fear na ought, if thou'rt my ain. On heathery bents I'll lay my head, Hardship, whan tholed for thee, has charms; Wi' thee I'll ask nae other bed, Nae other shielin than thy arms. SONG. [O marion is a bonny lass] Tune—If a Body meet a Body. O marion is a bonny lass, There's glawmry in her smile; And yet by a' it is confest, That Marion's free frae guile. Ilk rising thought, before she speaks, Ye maist wad think ye saw; An' then her voice comes like the breeze Blawn o'er the birken shaw. Whane'er she sings, her artless notes In sweetness far exceed The echo, that, frae rock to rock, Repeats the shepherd's reed: An' a' the while a wavering blush Her modest fears discloses, Like a bonny bird that sings embowered Amang a bush o' roses. Whan coming frae the fair wi' her, Though e'er sae late at een, The gloom is light, an hour's a blink, The muir's a foggy green. But what I like the best of a', She says whan I'm beside her, Be't light, be't dark, she never thinks That skaith can e'er betide her. MAIDA, OR THE BEGINNIN' O'T. Tune—A Rock and a Wee Pickle Tow. At Maida our Scotch lads gied Frenchmen a fleg, Was na that a guid beginnin' o't! For numbers maist double they cared na a feg; That was na an ill beginnin' o't. Puir Regnier drew up on the side o' a brae, Wi' a bog an' a wood atween him and the fae; But for braes, bogs, and woods, Scotchmen cared na a strae, An' they wist but to see the beginnin' o't. Up the hill, like a misty cloud after a shower, Our lads breasted up to the winnin' o't; Fare the right to the left ilka face leukit doure, An' wist but to hear the beginnin' o't. Now the silence was dead, till mak ready! was heard, Syne click gied ilk lock; level laigh was the word:— Here and there some French braggers lay flat on the yird; Was na that a guid beginnin' o't! But a' this was sport to the deeds o' the day, For what was it but the beginnin' o't,— Till Stuart cries—charge! then hey for the fae, And our callans push on to the winnin' o't. But at the first clash that the bagonets gie, The Frenchmen they swither, they stoiter, they flee: In the race, as in fechtin', our lads bear the gree, O that was a bonny rinnin' o't! THE COTTAR'S LAMENT. An' maun we leave our heartsome hame, To wander far awa'; An' maun we leave the glen sae lown, Below the birken shaw; An' maun our wee things nae mair wade, An' paidle in the burn; An' maun we a', baith auld and young, Learn,—Man was made to mourn! In some unhalesome, darksome town, We'll, ablins, find a bield; An' whan we're sick, the house o' dool Our helpless heads will shield: But nae kent faces there will sit To watch the troubled hour; An' stranger's hands will turn the couch, Wi' looks baith cauld and doure: The bloom upon the infant cheeks, That glint wi' thoughtless glee, Will fade right fast; and for the rose, A sallow hue we'll see. O then gif fok, wha hae the power, This ae cot-house wad spare! Our wee things' hands, up wa' and roof, Wad train the woodbine fair. A sweetbrier hedge we'd plant a' round, To scent the gloamin' hour; And change a cottar's hamely hut Into a bonny bower. O gin the fok, wha hae the power, Wad say the word—remain; What they in gowd and siller tint, They wad in blessins gain: Aye, nameless ways, by us unseen, God weel or wae extends, An' aften as the deed deserves, Heaven's dew or blight descends. THE THANKSGIVING OFF CAPE TRAFALGAR. Upon the high, yet gently rolling wave, The floating tomb that heaves above the brave, Soft sighs the gale, that late tremendous roared, Whelming the wretched remnants of the sword. And now the cannon's peaceful summons calls The victor bands, to mount their wooden walls, And from the ramparts, where their comrades fell, The mingled strain of joy and grief to swell: Fast they ascend, from stem to stern they spread, And crowd the engines whence the lightnings sped: The white-robed Priest his upraised hands extends; Hushed is each voice, attention leaning bends; Then from each prow the grand hosannas rise, Float o'er the deep, and hover to the skies. Heaven fills each heart; yet Home will oft intrude, And tears of love celestial joys exclude. The wounded man, who hears the soaring strain, Lifts his pale visage, and forgets his pain; While parting spirits, mingling with the lay, On halleluiahs wing their heavenward way. TO MY SON. Twice has the sun commenced his annual round, Since first thy footsteps tottered o'er the ground; Since first thy tongue was tuned to bless mine ear, By faultering out the name to fathers dear. O! nature's language, with her looks combined, More precious far than periods thrice refined! O! sportive looks of love, devoid of guile, I prize you more than beauty's magic smile; Yes, in that face, unconscious of its charm, I gaze with bliss, unmingled with alarm. Ah, no! full oft a boding horror flies Athwart my fancy, uttering fateful cries. Almighty Power! his harmless life defend, And if we part, 'gainst me the mandate send. And yet a wish will rise,—would I might live, Till added years his memory firmness give!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL.II. THE BIRDS OF SCOTLAND. Per virides passim ramos sua tecta volucres Concelebrant, mulcentque vagis loca sola querelis. Buchanan. PART FIRST. The woodland song, the various vocal quires, That harmonize fair Scotia's streamy vales; Their habitations, and their little joys; The winged dwellers on the leas, and moors, And mountain cliffs; the woods, the streams, them-selves, The sweetly rural, and the savage scene,— Haunts of the plumy tribes,—be these my theme! Come, Fancy, hover high as eagle's wing: Bend thy keen eye o'er Scotland's hills and dales; Float o'er her farthest isles; glance o'er the main; Or, in this briery dale, flit with the wren, From twig to twig; or, on the grassy ridge, Low nestle with the lark: Thou, simple bird, Of all the vocal quire, dwell'st in a home The humblest; yet thy morning song ascends Nearest to heaven,—sweet emblem of his song, Burns. Who sung thee wakening by the daisy's side! With earliest spring, while yet the wheaten blade Scarce shoots above the new-fall'n shower of snow, The skylark's note, in short excursion, warbles: Yes! even amid the day-obscuring fall, I've marked his wing winnowing the feathery flakes, In widely-circling horizontal flight. But, when the season genial smiles, he towers In loftier poise, with sweeter, fuller pipe, Chearing the ploughman at his furrow end,— The while he clears the share, or, listening, leans Upon his paddle-staff, and, with raised hand, Shadows his half-shut eyes, trying to scan The songster melting in the flood of light. On tree, or bush, no Lark is ever seen: The daisied lea he loves, where tufts of grass Luxuriant crown the ridge; there, with his mate, He founds their lowly house, of withered bents, And coarsest speargrass; next, the inner work With finer, and still finer fibres lays, Rounding it curious with his speckled breast. How strange this untaught art! it is the gift, The gift innate of Him, without whose will Not even a sparrow falleth to the ground. And now the assiduous dam her red-specked treasure, From day to day increases, till complete The wonted number, blythe, beneath her breast, She cherishes from morn to eve,—from eve To morn shields from the dew, that globuled lies Upon her mottled plumes: then with the dawn Upsprings her mate, and wakes her with his song. His song full well she knows, even when the sun, High in his morning course, is hailed at once By all the lofty warblers of the sky: But most his downward-veering song she loves; Slow the descent at first, then, by degrees, Quick, and more quick, till suddenly the note Ceases; and, like an arrow-fledge, he darts, And, softly lighting, perches by her side. But now no time for hovering welkin high, Or downward-gliding strain; the young have chipped, Have burst the brittle cage, and gaping bills Claim all the labour of the parent pair. Ah, labour vain! the herd-boy long has marked His future prize; the ascent, and glad return, Oft has he viewed; at last, with prying eyes, He found the spot, and joyful thought he held The full-ripe young already in his hand, Or bore them lightly to his broom-roofed bield: Even now he sits, amid the rushy mead, Half-hid, and warps the skep with willow rind, Or rounds the lid, still adding coil to coil, Then joins the osier hinge: the work complete Surveying, oft he turns, and much admires, Complacent with himself; then hies away With plundering intent. Ah, little think The harmless family of love, how near The robber treads! he stoops, and parts the grass, And looks with eager eye upon his prey. Quick round and round the parents fluttering wheel, Now high, now low, and utter shrill the plaint Of deep distress.—But soon forgot their woe: Not so with man! year after year he mourns, Year after year the mother weeps her son, Torn from her struggling arms by ruffian grasp, By robbery legalised. Low in a glen, Down which a little stream had furrowed deep, 'Tween meeting birchen boughs, a shelvy channel, And brawling mingled with the western tide; Far up that stream, almost beyond the roar Of storm-bulged breakers, foaming o'er the rocks With furious dash, a lowly dwelling lurked, Surrounded by a circlet of the stream. Before the wattled door, a greensward plat, With daisies gay, pastured a playful lamb; A pebbly path, deep-worn, led up the hill, Winding among the trees, by wheel untouched, Save when the winter fuel was brought home,— One of the poor man's yearly festivals. On every side it was a sheltered spot, So high and suddenly the woody steeps Arose. One only way, downward the stream, Just o'er the hollow, 'tween the meeting boughs, The distant wave was seen, with, now and then, The glimpse of passing sail; but, when the breeze Crested the distant wave, this little nook Was all so calm, that, on the limberest spray, The sweet bird chaunted motionless, the leaves At times scarce fluttering. Here dwelt a pair, Poor, humble, and content: one son alone, Their William, happy lived at home to bless Their downward years; he, simple youth, With boyish fondness, fancied he would love A seaman's life, and with the fishers sailed, To try their ways, far 'mong the western isles, Far as Saint Kilda's rock-walled shore abrupt, O'er which he saw ten thousand pinions wheel Confused, dimming the sky: These dreary shores Gladly he left; he had a homeward heart: No more his wishes wander to the waves. But still he loves to cast a backward look, And tell of all he saw, of all he learned; Of pillared Staffa, lone Iona's isle, Where Scotland's kings are laid; of Lewis, Sky, And of the mainland mountain-circled lochs; And he would sing the rowers timing chaunt, And chorus wild. Once on a summer's eve, When low the sun behind the highland hills Was almost set, he sung that song, to cheer The aged folks: upon the inverted quern The father sat; the mother's spindle hung Forgot, and backward twirled the half-spun thread; Listening with partial well-pleased look, she gazed Upon her son, and inly blessed the Lord, That he was safe returned: Sudden a noise Bursts rushing through the trees; a glance of steel Dazzles the eye, and fierce the savage band Glare all around, then single out their prey. In vain the mother clasps her darling boy, In vain the sire offers their little all: William is bound; they follow to the shore, Implore, and weep, and pray; knee-deep they stand, And view, in mute despair, the boat recede. But let me quit this scene, and bend my way Back to the inland vales, and up the heights, (Erst by the plough usurped,) where now the heath, Thin scattered up and down, blooming begins To re-appear: Stillness, heart-soothing, reigns, Save, now and then, the partridge's late call; Featly athwart the ridge she runs, now seen, Now in the furrow hid; then, screaming, springs, Joined by her mate, and to the grass-field flies: There, 'neath the blade, rudely she forms Her shallow nest, humble as is the lark's, But thrice more numerous her freckled store. Careful she turns them to her breast, and soft, With lightest pressure sits, scarce to be moved; Yes, she will sit, regardless of the scythe, That nearer, and still nearer, sweep by sweep, Levels the swarthe: Bold with a mother's fears, She, faithful to the last, maintains her post, And, with her blood, sprinkles a deeper red Upon the falling blossoms of the field;— While others, of her kind, content to haunt The upland ferny braes, remote from man, Behold a plenteous brood burst from the shell, And run; but soon, poor helpless things, return, And crowd beneath the fond inviting breast, And wings outstretching, quivering with delight. They grow apace; but still not far they range, Till on their pinions plumes begin to shoot; Then, by the wary parents led, they dare To skirt the earing crofts; at last, full fledged, They try their timorous wings, bending their flight Home to their natal spot, and pant amid the ferns. Oft by the side of sheep-fold, on the ground Bared by the frequent hoof, they love to lie And bask. O, I would never tire to look On such a scene of peacefulness as this! But nearer as I draw, with cautious step, Curious to mark their ways, at once alarmed, They spring; the startled lambs, with bickering haste, Flee to their mother's side, and gaze around: Far o'er yon whins the covey wing their way, And, wheeling round the broomy know, elude My following eye.—Fear not, ye harmless race; In me no longer shall ye find a foe! Even when each pulse beat high with bounding health, Ere yet the stream of life, in sluggish flow, Began to flag, and prematurely stop With ever-boding pause, even then my heart Was never in the sport; even then I felt,— Pleasure from pain was pleasure much alloyed. Alas, he comes! yes, yonder comes your foe, With sure determined eye, and in his hand The two-fold tube, formed for a double death. Full soon his spaniel, ranging far and wide, Will lead his footsteps to the very spot, The covert thick, in which, falsely secure, Ye lurking sit, close huddled, wing to wing: Yes, near and nearer still the spaniel draws, Retracing oft, and crossing oft his course, Till, all at once, scent-struck, with pendant tongue, And lifted paw, stiffened he panting stands. Forward, encouraged by the sportsman's voice, He hesitating creeps; when, flush, the game Upsprings, and, from the levelled turning tubes, The glance, once and again, bursts through the smoke. Nor, 'mid the rigours of the wintry day, Does savage man the enfeebled pinion spare; Then not for sport, but bread, with hawk-like eye, That needs no setter's aid, the fowler gaunt Roams in the snowy fields, and downward looks, Tracing the triple claw, that leads him on, Oft looking forward, to some thawing spring, Where, 'mid the withered iushes he discerns His destined prey; sidelong he stooping steps, Wary, and, with a never-erring aim, Scatters the flock wide fluttering in the snow;— The purpled snow records the cruel deed. With earliest spring, while yet in mountain cleughs Lingers the frozen wreath, when yeanling lambs, Upon the little heath-encircled patch Of smoothest sward, totter,—the gorcock's call Is heard from out the mist, high on the hill; But not till when the tiny heather bud Appears, are struck the spring-time leagues of love. Remote from shepherd's hut, or trampled fold, The new-joined pair their lowly mansion pitch, Perhaps beneath the juniper's rough shoots; Or castled on some plat of tufted heath, Surrounded by a narrow sable moat Of swampy moss. Within the fabric rude, Or e'er the new moon waxes to the full, The assiduous dam eight spotted spheroids sees, And feels beneath her heart, fluttering with joy. Nor long she sits, till, with redoubled joy, Around her she beholds an active brood Run to and fro, or through her covering wings Their downy heads look out; and much she loves To pluck the heather crops, not for herself, But for their little bills. Thus, by degrees, She teaches them to find the food, which God Has spread for them amid the desart wild, And seeming barrenness. Now they essay Their full-plumed wings, and, whirring, spurn the ground; But soon alight fast by yon moss-grown cairn, Round which the berries blae (a beauteous tint Of purple, deeper dyed with darkest blue) Lurk 'mid the small round leaves. Enjoy the hour, While yet ye may, ye unoffending flock! For not far distant now the bloody morn, When man's protection, selfishly bestowed, Shall be withdrawn, and murder roam at will. Low in the east, the purple tinge of dawn Steals upward o'er the clouds that overhang The welkin's verge. Upon the mountain side, The wakening covey quit their mother's wing, And spread around: Lost in the mist, They hear her call, and, quick returning, bless A mother's eye. Meantime, the sportsman keen Comes forth; and, heedless of the winning smile Of infant day, pleading on mercy's side, Anticipates, with eager joy, the sum Of slaughter, that, ere evening hour, he'll boast To have achieved;—and many a gory wing, Ere evening hour, exultingly he sees, Drop, fluttering, 'mid the heath,—even 'mid the bush, Beneath whose blooms the brooding mother sat, Till round her she beheld her downy young. At last mild twilight veils the insatiate eye, And stops the game of death. The frequent shot Resounds no more: Silence again resumes Her lonely reign; save that the mother's call Is heard repeated oft, a plaintive note! Mournful she gathers in her brood, dispersed By savage sport, and o'er the remnant spreads Fondly her wings; close nestling 'neath her breast, They cherished cower amid the purple blooms. While thus the heathfowl covey, day by day, Is lessened, till, perhaps, one drooping bird Survives,—the plover safe her airy scream Circling repeats, then to a distance flies, And, querulous, still returns, importunate; Yet still escapes, unworthy of an aim. Amid the marsh's rushy skirts, her nest Is slightly strewn; four eggs, of olive hue, Spotted with black, she broods upon: her young, Soon as discumbered of the fragile shell, Run lively round their dam. She, if or dog, Or man, intrude upon her bleak domain, Skims, clamouring loud, close at their feet, with wing Stooping, as if impeded by a wound; Meantime her young, among the rush-roots, lurk Secure. Ill-omened bird! oft in the times When monarchs owned no sceptre but the sword,— Far in the heathy waste, that stretches wide From Avendale to Loudon's high-coned hill, Thou, hovering o'er the panting fugitive, Through dreary moss and moor, hast screaming led The keen pursuer's eye: oft hast thou hung, Like a death flag, above the assembled throng, Whose lips hymned praise, their right hands at their hilts; Who, in defence of conscience, freedom, law, Looked stern, with unaverted eyes, on death In every form of horror. Bird of woe! Even to the tomb thy victims, by thy wing, Were haunted; o'er the bier thy direful cry Was heard, while murderous men rushed furious on, Profaned the sacred presence of the dead, And filled the grave with blood. At last, nor friend. Nor father, brother, comrade, dares to join The train, that frequent winds adown the heights. By feeble female hands the bier is borne, While on some neighbouring cairn the aged sire Stands bent, his gray locks waving in the blast. But who is she that lingers by the sod, When all are gone? 'Tis one who was beloved By him who lies below: Ill-omened bird! She never will forget, never forget, Thy dismal soughing wing, and doleful cry. Amid these woodless wilds, a small round lake I've sometimes marked, girt by a spungy sward Of lively green, with here and there a flower Of deep-tinged purple, firmly stalked, of form Pyramidal,—the shores bristling with reeds, That midway over wade, and, as they bend, Disclose the water lily, dancing light On waves soft-rippled by the July gale; Hither the long and soft-billed snipe resorts, By suction nourished; here her house she forms; Here warms her fourfold offspring into life. Alas! not long her helpless offspring feel Her fostering warmth; though suddenly she mounts, Her rapid rise, and vacillating flight, In vain defend her from the fowler's aim. But let me to the vale once more descend, And mingle with the woodland choir, and join Their various song, and celebrate with them The woods, the rocks, the streams, the bosky bourne, The thorny dingle, and the open glade; For 'tis not in their song, nor in their plumes, Nor in their wonderous ways, that all their charm Consists; No, 'tis the grove, their dwelling place, That lends them half their charm, that still is linked, By strong association's half-seen chain, With their sweet song, wherever it is sung. And while this lovely, this congenial theme, I slightly touch, O, may I ne'er forget, Nature, thy laws! be this my steady aim, To vindicate simplicity; to drive All affectation from the rural scene. There are, who, having seen some lordly pile, Surrounded by a sea of lawn, attempt, Within their narrow bounds, to imitate The noble folly. Down the double row Of venerable elms is hewn. Down crash, Upon the grass, the orchard trees, whose sprays, Enwreathed with blooms, and waved by gentlest gales, Would lightly at the shaded window beat, Breaking the morning's slumber with delight, Vernal delight. The ancient moss-coped wall, Or hedge impenetrable, interspersed With holly evergreen, the domicile Of many a little wing, is swept away; While, at respectful distance, rises up The red brick-wall, with flues, and chimney tops, And many a leafy crucifix adorned. Extends the level lawn with dropping trees New planted, dead at top, each to a post Fast-collared, culprit like. The smooth expanse Not one irregularity presents, Not even one grassy tuft, in which a lark Might find a home, and cheer the dull domain. Around the whole, a line vermicular, Of melancholy fir, and leaning larch, And shivering poplar, skirting the way side, Is thinly drawn. But should the tasteful Power, Pragmatic, which presides, with pencilling hand, And striding compasses, o'er all this change, Get in his thrall some hapless stream, that lurks Wimpling through hazelly shaw, and broomy glen, Instant the axe resounds through all the dale, And many a pair, unhoused, hovering lament The barbarous devastation: All is smoothed, Save here and there a tree; the hawthorn, brier. The hazel bush, the bramble, and the broom, The sloe-thorn, Scotia's myrtle, all are gone; And on the well-sloped bank arise trim clumps, Some round, and some oblong, of shrubs exotic, A wilderness of poisons, precious deemed In due proportion to their ugliness. What though fair Scotland's vallies rarely vaunt The oak majestical, whose aged boughs Darken a roodhreadth! yet no where is seen, More beauteously profuse, wild underwood; No where 'tis seen more beauteously profuse, Than on thy tangling banks, well-wooded Esk, And, Borthwick, thine, above that fairy nook Formed by your blending streams. The hawthorn there, With moss and lichen grey, dies of old age; Up to the topmost branches climbs the rose, And mingles with the fading blooms of May; While round the brier the honeysuckle wreaths Entwine, and, with their sweet perfume, embalm The dying rose: A never-failing blow, From spring to fall, expands; the sloethorn white, As if a flaky shower the leafless sprays Had hung; the hawthorn, May's fair diadem; The whin's rich dye; the bonny broom; the rasp Erect; the rose, red, white, and faintest pink; And long extending bramble's flowery shoots. The bank ascend, an open height appears Between the double streams that wind below: Look round; behold a prospect wide and fair;— The Lomond hills, with Fife's town-skirted shore, The intervening sea, Inchkeith's grey rocks, With beacon-turret crowned; Arthur's proud crest, And Salisbury abrupt; the Pentland range, Now peaked, and now, with undulating swell, Heaved to the clouds: More near, upon each hand, The sloping woods, bulging into the glade, Receding then with easy artless curve. Behind, a grove, of ancient trees, surrounds The ruins of a blood-cemented house, Half prostrate laid, as ever ought to lie The tyrant's dwelling. There no martin builds Her airy nest; not even the owl alights On these unhallowed walls: The murderer's head Was sheltered by these walls; hands blood-embrued Founded these walls,—Mackenzie's purpled hands!— Perfidious minion of a sceptred priest! The huge enormity of crime on crime, Accumulated high, but ill conceals The reptile meanness of thy dastard soul; Whose favourite art was lying with address, Whose hollow promise helped the princely hand To screw confessions from the tortured lips. Base hypocrite! thy character, pourtrayed By modern history's too lenient touch, Truth loves to blazon, with her real tints, To limn, of new, thy half-forgotten name, Inscribe with infamy thy time-worn tomb, And make the memory hated as the man. But better far truth loves to paint yon house Of humbler wall, half stone, half turf; with roof Of mended thatch, the sparrow's warm abode; The wisp-wound chimney, with its rising wreathe: The sloping garden, filled with useful herbs, Yet not without its rose; the patch of corn Upon the brow; the blooming vetchy ridge. But most the aged man, now wandering forth, I love to view; for 'neath yon homely guise Dwell worth, and simple dignity, and sense, Politeness natural, that puts to shame The world's grimace, and kindness crowning all. Why should the falsely great, the glittering names, Engross the muse's praise? My humble voice They ne'er engrossed, and never shall: I claim The title of the poor man's bard: I dare To celebrate an unambitious name; And thine, Kilgour, may yet some few years live, When low thy reverend locks mix with the mould. Even in a bird, the simplest notes have charms For me: I even love the yellow-hammer's song. When earliest buds begin to bulge, his note, Simple, reiterated oft is heard On leafless brier, or half-grown hedge-row tree; Nor is he silent until autumn's leaves Fall fluttering round his head of golden hue. Fair plumaged bird! cursed by the causeless hate Of every schoolboy, still by me thy lot Was pitied! never did I tear thy nest: I loved thee, pretty bird! for 'twas thy nest Which first, unhelped by older eyes, I found. The very spot I think I now behold! Forth from my low-roofed home I wandered blythe, Down to thy side, sweet Cart, where 'cross the stream A range of stones, below a shallow ford, Stood in the place of the now spanning arch; Up from that ford a little bank there was, With alder-copse and willow overgrown, Now worn away by mining winter floods; There, at a bramble root, sunk in the grass, The hidden prize, of withered field-straws formed, Well lined with many a coil of hair and moss, And in it laid five red-veined spheres, I found. The Syracusan's voice did not exclaim The grand Heureka, with more rapturous joy, Than at that moment fluttered round my heart. How simply unassuming is that strain! It is the redbreast's song, the friend of man. High is his perch, but humble is his home, And well concealed. Sometimes within the sound Of heartsome mill-clack, where the spacious door, White-dusted, tells him, plenty reigns around,— Close at the root of brier-bush, that o'erhangs The narrow stream, with shealings bedded white,— He fixes his abode, and lives at will. Oft near some single cottage, he prefers To rear his little home; there, pert and spruce, He shares the refuse of the goodwife's churn, Which kindly on the wall for him she leaves: Below her lintel oft he lights, then in He boldly flits, and fluttering loads his bill, And to his young the yellow treasure bears. Not seldom does he neighbour the low roof Where tiny elves are taught:—a pleasant spot It is, well fenced from winter blast, and screened, By high o'er-spreading boughs, from summer sun. Before the door a sloping green extends No farther than the neighbouring cottage-hedge, Beneath whose boortree shade a little well Is scooped, so limpid, that its guardian trout (The wonder of the lesser stooping wights) Is at the bottom seen.—At noontide hour, The imprisoned throng, enlarged, blythesome rush forth To sport the happy interval away; While those from distance come, upon the sward, At random seated, loose their little stores: In midst of them poor Redbreast hops unharmed, For they have read, or heard, and wept to hear, The story of the Children in the Wood; And many a crumb to Robin they will throw. Some Redbreasts love amid the deepest groves Retired, to pass the summer days: their song, Among the birchen boughs, with sweetest fall, Is warbled, pausing, then resumed more sweet, More sad; that, to an ear grown fanciful, The babes, the wood, the man, rise in review, And Robin still repeats the tragic line. But should the note of flute, or human voice, Sound through the grove, the madrigal at once Ceases; the warbler flits from branch to branch, And, stooping, sidelong turns his listening head. Ye lovers of his song, the greenwood path Each morn duly bestrew with a few crumbs: His friendship thus ye'll gain; till, by degrees, Alert, even from your hand, the offered boon He'll pick, half trustingly. Yes, I have seen Him, and his mate, attend, from tree to tree, My passing step; and, from my open hand, The morsel pick, timorous, and starting back, Returning still, with confidence increased. What little birds, with frequent, shrillest chirp, When honeysuckle flowers succeed the rose, The inmost thicket haunt!—their tawny breasts, Spotted with black, bespeak the youngling thrush, Though less in size; it is the Redbreast's brood, New flown, bewildered, still the downy tufts Upon their heads. But soon their full fledged wings, Long hesitating, quivering oft, they stretch: At last, encouraged by the parent voice, And leading flight, they reach the nearest bush, Or, falling short, lie panting on the ground; But, reassured, the destined aim attain. Nor long this helpless state: Each day adds strength, Adds wisdom, suited to their little sphere, Adds independence, first of heavenly boons! Released from all the duties, all the cares, The keen, yet sweet solicitudes, that haunt The parent's breast,—again the Redbreast's song Trills from the wood, or from the garden bough. Each season in its turn he hails; he hails, Perched on the naked tree, spring's earliest buds: At morn, at chilly eve, when the March sun Sinks with a wintry tinge, and Hesper sheds A frosty light, he ceases not his strain: And when staid Autumn walks with rustling tread, He mourns the falling leaf. Even when each branch Is leafless, and the harvest morn has clothed The fields in white, he, on the hoar-plumed spray, Delights, dear trustful bird! his future host. But farewell lessening days, in summer smile Arrayed. Dark winter's frown comes like a cloud, Whose shadow sweeps a mountain side, and scowls O'er all the land. Now warm stack-yards, and barns, Busy with bouncing flails, are Robin's haunts. Upon the barn's half door he doubting lights, And inward peeps.—But truce, sweet social bird! So well I love the strain, when thou'rt my theme, That now I almost tread the winter snows, While many a vernal song remains unsung. When snowdrops die, and the green primrose leaves Announce the coming flower, the merle's note, Mellifluous, rich, deep-toned, fills all the vale, And charms the ravished ear. The hawthorn bush, New-budded, is his perch; there the grey dawn He hails; and there, with parting light, concludes His melody. There, when the buds begin To break, he lays the fibrous roots; and, see, His jetty breast embrowned; the rounded clay His jetty breast has soiled; but now complete, His partner, and his helper in the work, Happy assumes possession of her home; While he, upon a neighbouring tree, his lay, More richly full, melodiously renews. When twice seven days have run, the moment snatch, That she has flitted off her charge, to cool Her thirsty bill, dipt in the babbling brook, Then silently, on tiptoe raised, look in, Admire: Five cupless acorns, darkly specked, Delight the eye, warm to the cautious touch. In seven days more expect the fledgeless young, Five gaping bills. With busy wing and eye Quick-darting, all alert, the parent pair Gather the sustenance which heaven bestows. But music ceases, save at dewy fall Of eve, when, nestling o'er her brood, the dam Has stilled them all to rest; or at the hour Of doubtful dawning grey; then from his wing Her partner turns his yellow bill, and chaunts His solitary song of joyous praise. From day to day, as blow the hawthorn flowers, That canopy this little home of love, The plumage of the younglings shoots and spreads, Filling with joy the fond parental eye. Alas! not long the parents' partial eye Shall view the fledging wing; ne'er shall they see The timorous pinion's first essay at flight. The truant schoolboy's eager, bleeding hand, Their house, their all, tears from the bending bush; A shower of blossoms mourns the ruthless deed. The piercing anguished note, the brushing wing, The spoiler heeds not; triumphing, his way, Smiling he wends: The ruined, hopeless pair, O'er many a field follow his townward steps, Then back return; and, perching on the bush, Find nought of all they loved, but one small tuft Of moss, and withered roots. Drooping they sit, Silent: Afar at last they fly, o'er hill And lurid moor, to mourn in other groves, And soothe, in gentler grief, their hapless lot. Meantime, the younger victims, one by one, Drop off, by care destroyed, and food unfit. Perhaps one, hardier than the rest, survives, And 'tween the wicker bars, with fading weeds Entwined, hung at some lofty window, hops From stick to stick his small unvaried round; While opposite, but higher still, the lark Stands fluttering, or runs o'er his narrow field, A span-breadth turf, tawny and parched, with wings Quivering, as if to fly; his carol gay Lightening the pale mechanic's tedious task. Poor birds, most sad the change! of daisied fields, Of hawthorn blooming sprays, of boundless air, With melody replete, for clouds of smoke, Through which the daw flies cawing steeple high; Or creak of grinding wheels, or skillet tongue, Shrilly reviling, more discordant still! But what their wretchedness, parents or young, Compared to that which wrings the human breast, Doomed to lament a loss, than death more dire,— The robbery of a child! Aye, there is wretchedness! Snatched playful from the rosy bank, by hands Inured to crimes, the innocent is borne Far, far away. Of all the varying forms Of human woe, this the most dire! To think He might have been now sporting at your side, But that, neglected, he was left a prey To pirate hands! To think how he will shudder, To see a hideous, haggard face attempt To smile away his tears, caressing him With horrible embrace, the while he calls Aloud, in vain, to you! Nor does even time,— Assuager of all other woes,—bring balm To this: Each child, to boyish years grown up, Reminds you of your boy! He might have been Like this, fair, blooming, modest, looking down With most engaging bashfulness: But now, Instead of this, perhaps, with sable mask Begrimed, he feebly totters 'neath a load, More fitted to his cruel master's strength. Perhaps, to manhood come, allured to sell His life, his freedom, for some paltry pounds, He now lies 'mong the numbered, nameless crowd, That groan on gory fields, envying the dead! Or, still more dreadful fate! dragged, trained, compelled, To vice, to crimes, death-sentenced crimes, perhaps Among those miserable names, which blot The calendar of death, his is inscribed! How much alike in habits, form, and size, The merle and the mavis! Thrush. how unlike In plumage, and in song! The thrush's song Is varied as his plumes; and as his plumes Blend beauteous, each with each, so run his notes Smoothly, with many a happy rise and fall. How prettily, upon his parded breast, The vividly contrasted tints unite To please the admiring eye; so, loud and soft, And high and low, all in his notes combine, In alternation sweet, to charm the ear. Full earlier than the blackbird he begins His vernal strain. Regardless of the frown Which winter casts upon the vernal day, Though snowy flakes melt in the primrose cup, He, warbling on, awaits the sunny beam, That mild gleams down, and spreads o'er all the grove. But now his song a partner for him gains; And in the hazel bush, or sloe, is formed The habitation of the wedded pair: Sometimes below the never-fading leaves Of ivy close, that overtwisting binds, And richly crowns, with clustered fruit of spring, Some riven rock, or nodding castle wall; Sometimes beneath the jutting root of elm, Or oak, among the sprigs, that overhang A pebble-chiding stream, the loam-lined house Is fixed, well hid from ken of hovering hawk, Or lurking beast, or schoolboy's prowling eye; Securely there the dam sits all day long, While from the adverse bank, on topmost shoot Of odour-breathing birch, her mate's blythe chaunt Cheers her pent hours, and makes the wild woods ring. Grudge not, ye owners of the fruited boughs, That he should pay himself for that sweet music, With which, in blossom time, he cheers your hearts! Scare, if ye will, his timid wing away, But, O, let not the leaden, viewless shower, Vollied from flashing tube, arrest his flight, And fill his tuneful, gasping bill with blood! These two, all others of the singing quires, In size, surpass. A contrast now behold: The little woodland dwarf, the tiny wren, That from the root-sprigs trills her ditty clear. Of stature most diminutive herself, Not so her wonderous house; for, strange to tell! Her's is the largest structure that is formed By tuneful bill and breast. 'Neath some old root, From which the sloping soil, by wintry rains, Has been all worn away, she fixes up Her curious dwelling, close, and vaulted o'er, And in the side a little gateway porch, In which (for I have seen) she'll sit and pipe A merry stave of her shrill roundelay. Nor always does a single gate suffice For exit, and for entrance to her dome; For when (as sometimes haps) within a bush She builds the artful fabric, then each side Has its own portico. But, mark within! How skilfully the finest plumes and downs Are softly warped; how closely all around The outer layers of moss! each circumstance Most artfully contrived to favour warmth! Here read the reason of the vaulted roof; Here Providence compensates, ever kind, The enormous disproportion that subsists Between the mother and the numerous brood, Which her small bulk must quicken into life. Fifteen white spherules, small as moorland hare-bell, And prettily bespecked like fox-glove flower, Complete her number. Twice five days she sits, Fed by her partner, never flitting off, Save when the morning sun is high, to drink A dewdrop from the nearest flowret cup. But now behold the greatest of this train Of miracles, stupendously minute; The numerous progeny, demanding food, Supplied by two small bills, and feeble wings Of narrow range; supplied, aye, duly fed, Fed in the dark, and yet not one forgot! When whinny braes are garlanded with gold, And, blythe, the lamb pursues, in merry chase, His twin around the bush; the linnet, then, Within the prickly fortress builds her bower, And warmly lines it round, with hair and wool Inwove. Sweet minstrel, may'st thou long delight The whinny knowe, and broomy brae, and bank Of fragrant birch! May never fowler's snare Tangle thy struggling foot! Or, if thou'rt doomed Within the narrow cage thy dreary days To pine, may ne'er the glowing wire (Oh, crime accursed!) Quench, with fell agony, thy shrivelling eye! Deprived of air and freedom, shall the light Of day, thy only pleasure, be denied? But thy own song will still be left; with it, Darkling, thou'lt soothe the lingering hours away; And thou wilt learn to find thy triple perch, Thy seed-box, and thy beverage saffron-tinged. Nor is thy lot more hard than that which they (Poor linnets!) prove in many a storied pile: The allusion here is chiefly to Cotton-mills. They see the light, 'tis true,—they see and know, That light for them is but an implement Of toil. In summer with the sun they rise To toil, and with his setting beam they cease To toil: nor does the shortened winter day Their toil abridge; for, ere the cock's first crow, Aroused to toil, they lift their heavy eyes, And force their childish limbs to rise and toil; And, while the winter night, by cottage fire, Is spent in homebred industry, relieved By harmless glee, or tale of witch, or ghost, So dreadful, that the housewife's listening wheel Suspends its hum, their toil protracted lasts: Even when the royal birth, by wonderous grace, Gives one half day to mirth, that shred of time Must not be lost, but thriftily ekes out To-morrow's and to-morrow's lengthened task. No joys, no sports have they: what little time, The fragment of an hour, can be retrenched From labour, is devoted to a shew, A boasted boon, of what the public gives,— Instruction. Viewing all around the bliss Of liberty, they feel its loss the more; Freely through boundless air, they wistful see, The wild bird's pinion past their prison flit; Free in the air the merry lark they see On high ascend; free on the swinging spray The woodland bird is perched, and leaves at will Its perch; the open quivering bill they see, But no sweet note by them is heard, all lost, Extinguished in the noise that ceaseless stuns the ear. Here vice collected festers, and corrupts. The female virtues fade; and in their stead, Springs up a produce rank of noxious weeds. And, if such be the effects of that sad system, Which, in the face of nature's law, would wring Gain from the labouring hands of playful children; If such the effects, where worth and sense direct The living, intellectual machines, What must not follow, when the power is lodged With senseless, sordid, heartless avarice? Where, fancy, hast thou led me? No, stern truth, 'Tis thou hast led me from the pleasant sight Of blossomed furze, and bank of fragrant birch. And now once more I turn me to the woods, With willing step, and list, closing my eyes, The lulling, soothing sounds, that pour a balm Into the rankled soul: the brooklet's murmur, That louder to the ear, long listening, grows, And louder still, like noise of many waters, Yet not so loud but that the wild bee's buzz Slung past the ear, and grasshopper's shrill chirp, Are heard; for now the sultry hours unfurl Each insect wing: the aimless butterflies, In airy dance, cross and recross the mead; The dragon-fly, in horizontal course, Spins over-head, and fast eludes the sight. At such a still and sultry hour as this, When not a strain is heard through all the woods, I've seen the shilfa Chaffinch. light from off his perch, And hop into a shallow of the stream, Then, half afraid, flit to the shore, then in Again alight, and dip his rosy breast And fluttering wings, while dewlike globules coursed The plumage of his brown-empurpled back. The barefoot boy, who, on some slaty stone, Almost too hot for touch, has watching stood, Now thinks the well-drenched prize his own, And rushes forward;—quick, though wet, the wing Gains the first branches of some neighbouring tree, And baulks the upward gazing hopeless eye. The ruffling plumes are shook, the pens are trimmed, And full and clear the sprightly ditty rings, Cheering the brooding dam: she sits concealed Within the nest deep-hollowed, well disguised With lichens grey, and mosses gradual blent, As if it were a knurle in the bough. With equal art externally disguised, But of internal structure passing far The feathered concaves of the other tribes, The goldfinch weaves, with willow down inlaid, And cannach tufts, his wonderful abode. Sometimes, suspended at the limber end Of planetree spray, among the broad leaved shoots, The tiny hammock swings to every gale; Sometimes in closest thickets 'tis concealed; Sometimes in hedge luxuriant, where the brier, The bramble, and the plumtree branch, Warp through the thorn, surmounted by the flowers Of climbing vetch, and honeysuckle wild, All undefaced by art's deforming hand. But mark the pretty bird himself! how light, And quick, his every motion, every note! How beautiful his plumes! his red-ringed head; His breast of brown; and see him stretch his wing,— A fairy fan of golden spokes it seems. Oft on the thistle's tuft he, nibbling, sits, Light as the down; then, 'mid a flight of downs, He wings his way, piping his shrillest call. Proud Thistle! emblem dear to Scotland's sons! Begirt with threatening points, strong in defence, Unwilling to assault! By thee the arm Of England was repelled; the rash attempt, Oft did the wounded arm of England rue. But fraud prevailed, where force had tried in vain: Fraud undermined thy root, and laid thy head, Thy crested head, low sullied in the dust. Belhaven, Fletcher, venerated shades! Long shall your glorious names, your words of fire, Spite of beledgered Trade's corrupting creed, That estimates a country by its gold, And balances surrendered freedom's self,— The life-blood of a people!—with a show Of columns crowded full of pounds and pence; Long shall your names illume the historic page, Inspire the poet's lay, kindle the glow Of noble daring in the patriot's breast! Deep-toned (a contrast to the goldfinch note) The cushat plains; nor is her changeless plaint Unmusical, when with the general quire, Of woodland harmony, it softly blends. Her sprig-formed nest, upon some hawthorn branch, Is laid so thinly, that the light of day Is through it seen: So rudely it is formed, That oft the simple boy, who counts the hours By blowing off the dandelion downs, Mistakes the witch-knots for the cushat's nest. Sweet constant bird! the lover's favourite theme! Protected by the love-inspiring lay, Seldom thou mov'st thy home; year after year, The self-same tree beholds thy youngling pair Matured to flight.—There is a hawthorn tree, With which the ivy arms have wrestled long; 'Tis old, yet vigorous: beneath its shade A beauteous herb, so rare, that all the woods, For far and near around, cannot produce Its like, shoots upright; from the stalk Four pointed leaves, luxuriant, smooth, diverge, Crowned with a berry of deep purple hue. Upon this aged thorn, a lovely pair Of cushats wont to build: No schoolboy's hand Would rob their simple nest; the constant coo, That floated down the dell, softened his heart. But ah! the pirate of the rock, the hawk, Hovering, discerned the prize: Soft blew the gale Of may, and full the greenwood chorus rose, All but the sweet dove's note: In vain the ear Turned listening; strewn upon the ground, The varying plumes, with drooping violets mixed, Disclosed the death the beauteous bird had died. Where are your haunts, ye helpless birds of song, When winter's cloudy wing begins to shade The emptied fields; when ripening sloes assume Their deepest jet, and wild plums purple hang Tempting, yet harsh till mellowed by the frost? Ah, now ye sit crowding upon the thorns, Beside your former homes, all desolate, And filled with withered leaves; while fieldfare flocks From distant lands alight, and, chirping, fly From hedge to hedge, avoiding man's approach. Of all the tuneful tribes, the Redbreast sole Confides himself to man; others sometimes Are driven within our lintel-posts by storms, And, fearfully, the sprinkled crumbs partake: He feels himself at home. When lours the year, He perches on the village turfy copes, And, with his sweet but interrupted trills, Bespeaks the pity of his future host. But long he braves the season, ere he change The heaven's grand canopy for man's low home; Oft is he seen, when fleecy showers bespread The house tops white, on the thawed smiddy roof, Or in its open window he alights, And, fearless of the clang, and furnace glare, Looks round, arresting the uplifted arm, While on the anvil cools the glowing bar. But when the season roughens, and the drift Flies upward, mingling with the falling flakes In whirl confused,—then on the cottage floor He lights, and hops, and flits, from place to place, Restless at first, till, by degrees, he feels He is in safety: Fearless then he sings The winter day; and when the long dark night Has drawn the rustic circle round the fire, Waked by the dinsome wheel, he trims his plumes, And, on the distaff perched, chaunts soothingly His summer song; or, fearlessly, lights down Upon the basking sheep-dog's glossy fur; Till, chance, the herd-boy, at his supper mess, Attract his eye, then on the milky rim Brisk he alights, and picks his little share. Besides the Redbreast's note, one other strain, One summer strain, on wintry days is heard. Amid the leafless thorn, the merry Wren, When icicles hang dripping from the rock, Pipes her perennial lay; even when the flakes, Broad as her pinions, fall, she lightly flies Athwart the shower, and sings upon the wing. While thus the smallest of the plumy tribes Defies the storm, others there are that fly, Long ere the winter lours, to genial skies; Nor this cold clime revisit, till the blooms Of parting spring blow 'mid the summer buds. PART SECOND. How sweet the first sound of the cuckoo's note!— Whence is the magic pleasure of the sound? How do we long recal the very tree, Or bush, near which we stood, when on the ear The unexpected note, cuckoo! again, And yet again, came down the budding vale? It is the voice of spring among the trees; It tells of lengthening days, of coming blooms; It is the symphony of many a song. But, there, the stranger flies close to the ground, With hawklike pinion, of a leaden blue. Poor wanderer! from hedge to hedge she flies, And trusts her offspring to another's care: The sooty-plum'd hedge-sparrow frequent acts The foster-mother, warming into life The youngling, destined to supplant her own. Meanwhile, the cuckoo sings her idle song, Monotonous, yet sweet, now here, now there, Herself but rarely seen; nor does she cease Her changeless note, until the broom, full blown, Give warning, that her time for flight is come. Thus, ever journeying on, from land to land, She, sole of all the innumerous feathered tribes, Passes a stranger's life, without a home. Home! word delightful to the heart of man, And bird, and beast!—small word, yet not the less Significant:—Comprising all! Whatever to affection is most dear, Is all included in that little word,— Wife, children, father, mother, brother, friend. At mention of that word, the seaman, clinging Upon the dipping yard-arm, sees afar The twinkling fire, round which his children cow'r, And speak of him, counting the months, and weeks, That must pass dreary o'er, ere he return. He sighs to view the sea-bird's rapid wing. O, had I but the envied power to chuse My home, no sound of city bell should reach My ear; not even the cannon's thundering roar. Far in a vale, be there my low abode, Embowered in woods where many a songster chaunts. And let me now indulge the airy dream! A bow-shot off in front a river flows, That, during summer drought, shallow and clear, Chides with its pebbly bed, and, murmuring, Invites forgetfulness; half hid it flows, Now between rocks, now through a bush-girt glade, Now sleeping in a pool, that laves the roots Of overhanging trees, whose drooping boughs Dip midway over in the darkened stream; While ever and anon, upon the breeze, The dash of distant waterfall is borne. A range of hills, with craggy summits crowned, And furrowed deep, with many a bosky cleugh, Wards off the northern blast: There skims the hawk Forth from her cliff, eyeing the furzy slope That joins the mountain to the smiling vale. Through all the woods the holly evergreen, And laurel's softer leaf, and ivied thorn, Lend winter shelter to the shivering wing. No gravelled paths, pared from the smooth-shaved turf, Wind through these woods; the simple unmade road, Marked with the frequent hoof of sheep or kine, Or rustic's studded shoe, I love to tread. No threatening board forewarns the homeward hind, Of man-traps, or of law's more dreaded gripe. Pleasant to see the labourer homeward hie Light hearted, as he thinks his hastening steps Will soon be welcomed by his children's smile! Pleasant to see the milkmaid's blythesome look, As to the trysting thorn she gaily trips, With steps that scarcely feel the elastic ground! Nor be the lowly dwellings of the poor Thrust to a distance, as unseemly sights. Curse on the heartless taste that, proud, exclaims, “Erase the hamlet, sweep the cottage off; “Remove each stone, and only leave behind “The trees that once embowered the wretched huts. “What though the inmates old, who hoped to end “Their days below these trees, must seek a home, “Far from their native fields, far from the graves “In which their fathers lie,—to city lanes, “Darksome and close, exiled? It must be so; “The wide extending lawn would else be marred, “By objects so incongruous.” Barbarous taste! Stupidity intense! Yon straw-roofed cot, Seen through the elms, it is a lovely sight! That scattered hamlet, with its burn-side green, On which the thrifty housewife spreads her yarn, Or half-bleached web, while children busy play, And paddle in the stream,—for every heart, Untainted by pedantic rules, hath charms. I love the neighbourhood of man and beast: I would not place my stable out of sight. No; close behind my dwelling, it should form A fence, on one side, to my garden plat. What beauty equals shelter, in a clime Where wintry blasts with summer breezes blend, Chilling the day! How pleasant 'tis to hear December's winds, amid surrounding trees, Raging aloud! how grateful 'tis to wake, While raves the midnight storm, and hear the sound Of busy grinders at the well filled rack; Or flapping wing, and crow of chanticleer, Long ere the lingering morn; or bouncing flails, That tell the dawn is near! Pleasant the path By sunny garden-wall, when all the fields Are chill and comfortless; or barn-yard snug, Where flocking birds, of various plume, and chirp Discordant, cluster on the leaning stack, From whence the thresher draws the rustling sheaves. O, nature! all thy seasons please the eye Of him who sees a Deity in all. It is His presence that diffuses charms Unspeakable, o'er mountain, wood, and stream. To think that He, who hears the heavenly choirs, Hearkens complacent to the woodland song; To think that He, who rolls yon solar sphere, Uplifts the warbling songster to the sky; To mark His presence in the mighty bow, That spans the clouds, as in the tints minute Of humblest flower; to hear his awful voice In thunder speak, and whisper in the gale; To know, and feel His care for all that lives;— 'Tis this that makes the barren waste appear A fruitful field, each grove a paradise. Yes! place me 'mid far stretching woodless wilds, Where no sweet song is heard; the heath-bell there Would soothe my weary sight, and tell of Thee! There would my gratefully uplifted eye Survey the heavenly vault, by day,—by night, When glows the firmament from pole to pole; There would my overflowing heart exclaim, The heavens declare the glory of the Lord, The firmament shews forth his handy work! Less loud, but not less clear, His humbler works Proclaim his power; the swallow knows her time, And, on the vernal breezes, wings her way, O'er mountain, plain, and far-extending seas, From Afric's torrid sands to Britain's shore. Before the cuckoo's note, she, twittering, gay, Skims o'er the brook, or skiffs the greenwood tops, When dance the midgy clouds in warping maze Confused: 'tis thus, by her, the air is swept Of insect myriads, that would else infest The greenwood walk, blighting each rural joy: For this,—if pity plead in vain—O, spare Her clay-built home! Her all, her young, she trusts, Trusts to the power of man: fearful, herself She never trusts; free, the long summer morn, She, at his window, hails the rising sun.— Twice seven days she broods; then on the wing, From morn to dewy eve, unceasing plies, Save when she feeds or cherishes her young; And oft she's seen, beneath her little porch, Clinging supine, to deal the air-gleaned food. From her the husbandman the coming shower Foretells: Along the mead closely she skiffs, Or o'er the streamlet pool she skims, so near, That, from her dipping wing, the wavy circlets Spread to the shore: then fall the single drops, Prelusive of the shower. The martins, too, The dwellers in the ruined castle wall, When low'rs the sky a flight less lofty wheel. Presageful of the thunder peal, when deep A boding silence broods o'er all the vale, From airy altitudes they stoop, and fly Swiftly, with shrillest scream, round and around The rugged battlements; or fleetly dart Through loopholes, whence the shaft was wont to glance; Or thrid the window of the lofty bower, Where hapless royalty, with care-closed eyes, Woo'd sleep in vain, foreboding what befel,— The loss of friends, of country, freedom, life! Long ere the wintry gusts, with chilly sweep, Sigh through the leafless groves, the swallow tribes, Heaven-warned, in airy bevies congregate, Or clustering sit, as if in deep consult What time to launch; but, lingering, they wait, Until the feeble of the latest broods Have gathered strength, the sea-ward path to brave. At last the farewell twitter spreading sounds; Aloft they fly, and melt in distant air. Far o'er the British sea, in westering course, O'er the Biscayan mountain-waves they glide: Then o'er Iberian plains, through fields of air, Perfumed by orchard groves, where lowly bends The orange bough beneath its juicy load, Thence over Calpe's thunder-shielded rock They stretch their course to Mauritania's plains. There are who doubt this migratory flight. But wherefore, from the distance of the way, Should wonder verge on disbelief,—the bulk So small, the buoyant wing so large and strong? Behold the corn-craik; she, too, wings her way To other lands: ne'er is she found immersed In lakes, or buried torpid in the sand, Though weak her wing contrasted with her bulk. Seldom she rises from the grassy field, And never till compelled; and, when upraised, With feet suspended, awkwardly she flies; Her flight a ridge-breadth: suddenly she drops, And, running, still eludes the following foot. Poor bird, though harsh thy note, I love it well! It tells of summer eves, mild and serene, When through the grass, waist-deep, I wont to wade In fruitless chace of thee; now here, now there, Thy desultory call. Oft does thy call The midnight silence break; oft, ere the dawn, It wakes the slumbering lark; he upward wings His misty way, and, viewless, sings and soars. PART THIRD. Farewell the greenwood, and the welkin song! Farewell the harmless bill!—The o'erfolding beak, Incurvated: the clutching pounce; the eye, Ferocious, keen, full-orbed; the attitude Erect; the skimming flight; the hovering poise; The rapid sousing stroke;—these now I sing! How fleet the Falcon's pinion in pursuit! Less fleet the linnet's flight!—Alas, poor bird! Weary and weak is now thy flagging wing, While close and closer draws the eager foe. Now up she rises, and, with arrowed pinions, Impetuous souses; but in vain: With turn Sudden, the linnet shuns the deadly stroke, Throwing her far behind; but quick again She presses on: Down drops the feeble victim Into the hawthorn bush, and panting sits. The falcon, skimming round and round, espies Her prey, and darts among the prickly twigs. Unequal now the chace! struggling she strives, Entangled in the thorny labyrinth, While easily its way the small bird winds, Regaining soon the centre of the grove. But not alone the dwellers of the wood Tremble beneath the falcon's fateful wing. Oft hovering o'er the barn-yard is she seen, In early spring, when round their ruffling dam The feeble younglings pick the pattering hail: And oft she plunges low, and swiftly skims The ground; as oft the bold and threatening mien Of chanticleer deters her from the prey. Amid the mountain fells, or river cliffs Abrupt, the falcon's eyry, perched on high, Defies access: broad to the sun 'tis spread, With withered sprigs hung o'er the dizzy brink. What dreadful cliffs o'erhang this little stream! So loftily they tower, that he who looks Upward, to view their almost meeting summits, Feels sudden giddiness, and instant grasps The nearest fragment of the channel rocks, Resting his aching eye on some green branch That midway down shoots from the creviced crag. Athwart the narrow chasm fleet flies the rack, Each cloud no sooner visible than gone; While 'tween these natural bulwarks, that deride The art of man, murmurs the hermit brook, And joins, with opened banks, the full-streamed Clyde. How various are thy aspects, noble stream! Now gliding silently by sloping banks, Now flowing softly with a silver sound, Now rushing, tumbling, boiling, through the rocks. Even on that bulging verge smooth flows thy stream, Then spreads along a gentle ledge, then sweeps Compressed by an abutting turn, till o'er It pours tremendously; again it sweeps Unpausing, till, again, with louder roar, It mines into the boisterous wheeling gulph; While high the boulted foam, at times, displays An Iris arch, thrown light from rock to rock; And oft the swallow through the misty cloud Flits fearlessly, and drinks upon the wing. O, what an amphitheatre surrounds The abyss, in which the downward mass is plunged, Stunning the ear! High as the falcon's flight, The rocks precipitous ascend, and bound The scene magnificent; deep, deep below, The snowy surge spreads to a dark expanse. These are the rocks on which the youthful eye Of Wallace gazed, the music this he loved. Oft has he stood upon the trembling brink, Unstayed by tree or twig, absorbed in thought; There would he trace, with eager eye, the oak, Uprooted from its bank by ice-fraught floods, And floating o'er the dreadful cataract: There would he moralize upon its fate;— It re-appears with scarce a broken bough, It re-appears,—Scotland may yet be free! High rides the moon amid the fleecy clouds, That glisten, as they float athwart her disk; Sweet is the glimpse that, for a moment, plays Among these mouldering pinnacles:—but, hark! That dismal cry! It is the wailing owl. Night long she mourns, perched on some vacant niche, Or time-rent crevice: Sometimes to the woods She bends her silent, slowly moving wing, And on some leafless tree, dead of old age, Sits watching for her prey; but should the foot Of man intrude into her solemn shades, Startled, he hears the fragile, breaking branch Crash as she rises:—farther in the gloom, To deeper solitudes she wings her way. Oft in the hurly of the wintry storm, Housed in some rocking steeple, she augments The horror of the night; or when the winds Exhausted pause, she listens to the sound Of the slow-swinging pendulum, till loud Again the blast is up, while lightning-gleams Shoot 'thwart, and ring a fearful, deadly toll. On ancient oak, or elm, whose topmast boughs Begin to fail, the raven's twig-formed house Is built; and, many a year, the self same tree The aged solitary pair frequent. But distant is their range; for oft at morn They take their flight, and not till twilight grey Their slow returning cry hoarse meets the ear. Well does the raven love the sound of war.— Amid those plains, where Danube darkly rolls, The theatres, on which the kingly play Of war is oftenest acted, there the peal Of cannon-mouths summons the sable flocks To wait their death-doomed prey; and they do wait: Yes, when the glittering columns, front to front Drawn out, approach in deep and awful silence, The raven's voice is heard hovering between. Sometimes upon the far-deserted tents She boding sits, and sings her fateful song. But in the abandoned field she most delights, When o'er the dead and dying slants the beam Of peaceful morn, and wreaths of reeking mist Rise from the gore-dewed sward: from corpse to corpse She revels, far and wide; then, sated, flies To some shot-shivered branch, whereon she cleans Her purpled beak; and down she lights again, To end her horrid meal: another, keen, Plunges her beak deep in yon horse's side, Till, by the hungry hound displaced, she flits Once more to human prey. Ah, who is he At whose heart-welling wound she drinks, Glutting her thirst! He was a lovely youth; Fair Scotia was his home, until his sire To swollen Monopoly resigned, heart-wrung, The small demesne which his forefathers plowed: Wide then dispersed the family of love. One son betook him to the all-friendly main; Another, with his aged parents, plied The sickly trade, in city garret pent; Their youngest born, the drum and martial show,— Deluded half, and half despairing,—joined; And soon he lay the food of bird and beast. Long is his fate unknown; the horrid sum Of dead is named, but boding fear is left, Enlabyrinthed in doubt, to please itself With dark, misgiving hope. Ah, one there is, Who fosters long the languid hope, that still He may return: The live-long summer day She at the house-end sits; and oft her wheel Is stopt, while on the road, far-stretched, she bends A melancholy, eye-o'erflowing look; Or strives to mould the distant traveller Into the form of him who's far away. Hopeless, and broken-hearted, still she loves To sing, When wild war's deadly blast was blawn. The first line of “The Soldier's Return,” a song by Burns. Alas! War riots with increasing rage. Behold that field bestrewn with bleaching bones; And, mark! the raven in the horse's ribs, Gathering, engaged, the gleanings of a harvest Almost forgotten now: Rejoice, ye birds of prey! No longer shall ye glean your scanty meals; Upon that field again long prostrate wreaths, Death-mown, shall lie: I see the gory mound Of dead, and wounded, piled, with here and there A living hand, clutching in vain for help. But what the horrors of the field of war, To those, the sequel of the foiled attempt Of fettered vengeance struggling to be free!— Inhuman sons of Europe! not content With dooms of death, your victim high ye hung Encaged, to scorch beneath the torrid ray, And feed, alive, the hungry fowls of heaven. Around the bars already, see, they cling! The vulture's head looks through; she strives in vain To force her way: The lesser birds await Till worn-out nature sinks; then on they pounce, And tear the quivering flesh: in agony The victim wakes, and rolls his wretched eyes, And feebly drives the ravening flocks away. Most dreadfully he groans: 'tis thirst, thirst, thirst, Direst of human torments!—down again He sinks;—again he feels the torturing beak. England, such things have been, and still would be, But that the generous band, the stedfast friends Of Afric's sons, stand ready to avenge Their wrongs, and chain the tyrant arm. One of that band of brothers is no more: The voice of freedom's firmest friend is mute. O what a spirit heavenward has forsook This darkened orb! In him was meekly blent Intelligence all but intuitive, With infantine simplicity of soul;— But vain is language to pourtray that mind, That system, comprehensive, yet exact,— As vain as man's poor efforts to describe, By mimic spheres with gilded satellites, The march stupendous of the starry host. His eloquence! There too all language, but his own, would fail; For who from glimmering sparks that crackling gleam From art's electric ordnance, could conceive The thunder's voice, that awes the world to silence; The vivid flash that passes like a thought From heaven to earth, or thwart the welkin's cope, The hemisphere illuming with its blaze! But these are not remembrances that glad Thy gentle soul: No; 'mid celestial joys Not one to thee bliss more congenial brings, Than memory of thy stedfastness long tried, Immoveable, unwearied in the cause Of Afric's sons by freemens' hands enslaved, Than does the hope, now almost realized, That on the blood-stained coast where murder's flag Streamed more terrific than the lion's mane, The father shall lay down his head in peace Among his infants on their leafy couch, Nor wake from dreams of horror that he hears The white man's voice dooming him to be torn From children, wife, from father, brother, friend, Or, more disastrous still! that all most dear To his wrung heart his destiny must share. Yet not to thee, spirit benign! is due The highest praise, for Africa restored To human rights: There is a man, endowed With eloquence, sublime as was the cause, With fortitude undaunted by defeat, With confidence derived from trust in heaven, Who moved, inspired the combination grand Of virtues, talents, ranged on mercy's side, Who shuns applause, whose actions are his name. On distant waves, the raven of the sea, The cormorant, devours her carrion food. Along the blood-stained coast of Senegal, Prowling, she scents the cassia-perfumed breeze Tainted with death, and, keener, forward flies: The towering sails, that waft the house of woe, Afar she views: upon the heavy hulk, Deep-logged with wretchedness, full fast she gains: (Revolting sight! the flag of freedom waves Above the stern-emblazoned words, that tell The amount of crimes which Britain's boasted laws, Within the narrow wooden walls, permit!) And now she nighs the carnage-freighted keel, Unscared by rattling fetters, or the shriek Of mothers, o'er their ocean-buried babes. Lured by the scent, unweariedly she flies, And at the foamy dimples of the track Darts sportively, or perches on a corpse. From scenes like these, O, Scotland, once again To thee my weary fancy fondly hies, And, with the eagle, mountain-perched, alights. Amid Lochaber's wilds, or dark Glencoe, High up the pillared mountain's steepest side, The eagle, from her eyry on the crag Of over-jutting rock, beholds afar. Viewing the distant flocks, with ranging eye She meditates the prey; but waits the time When seas of mist extend along the vale, And, rising gradual, reach her lofty shore: Up then to sunny regions of the air She soars, and looks upon the white-wreathed summits Of mountains, seeming ocean isles; then down She plunges, stretching through the hazy deep; Unseen she flies, and, on her playful quarry, Pounces unseen: The shepherd knows his loss, When high o'erhead he hears a passing bleat Faint, and more faintly, dying far away. And now aloft she bends her homeward course, Loaded, yet light; and soon her youngling pair, Joyful descry her buoyant wing emerge And float along the cloud; fluttering they stoop Upon the dizzy brink, as if they aimed To try the abyss, and meet her coming breast; But soon her coming breast, and outstretched wings, Glide shadowing down, and close upon their heads. It was upon the eagle's plundered store That Wallace fared, when hunted from his home, A glorious outlaw! by the lawless power Of freedom's foiled assassin, England's king. Along the mountain cliffs, that ne'er were clomb By other footstep than his own, 'twas there His eagle-visioned genius, towering, planned The grand emprise of setting Scotland free. He longed to mingle in the storm of war; And as the eagle dauntlessly ascends, Revelling amid the elemental strife, His mind sublimed prefigured to itself Each circumstance of future hard-fought fields,— The battle's hubbub loud; the forceful press, That from his victim hurries him afar; The impetuous close concentrated assault, That, like a billow broken on the rocks, Recedes, but forward heaves with doubled fury. When low'rs the moveless, massive rack, high piled, And silence deep foretells the thunder near, The eagle upward penetrates the gloom, And, far above the fire-impregnate wreaths, The ethereal-towered volcanos soaring views; Till, muttering low at first, begins the peal; Then she descends,—she loves the thunder's voice, She wheels, and sports amid the rattling clouds, Undazzled gazes on the sheeted blaze, Darts at the flash, or, hung in hovering poise, Delighted hears the music of the roar. Nor does the wintry blast, the drifting fall, Shrouded in night, and, with a death-hand grasp, Benumbing life, drive her to seek the roof Of cave, or hollow cliff; firm on her perch, Her ancient and accustomed rock, she sits, With wing-couched head, and, to the morning light, Appears a frost-rent fragment, coped with snow. Yet her, invulnerable as she seems By every change of elemental power, The art of man, the general foe of man, And bird, and beast, subdues; the leaden bolt, Slung from the mimic lightning's nitrous wing, Brings low her head; her close and mailed plumage Avails her nought,—for higher than her perch The clambering marksman lies, and takes his aim Instant upon her flight, when every plume Ruffling expands to catch the lifting gale. She has the death; upward a little space She springs, then plumb down drops: The victor stands, Long listening, ere he hear the fall; at last, The crashing branches of the unseen wood, Far down below, send echoing up the sound, That faintly rises to his leaning ear. But, woe to him! if, with the mortal wound, She still retain strength to revenge the wrong: Her bleeding wing she veers; her maddened eye Discerns the lurking wretch; on him she springs; One talon clutched, with life's last struggling throes Convulsed, is buried at his heart; the other Deep in his tortured eyeballs is transfixed: Pleased, she expires upon his writhing breast. Of bulk more huge, and borne on broader vans, The eagle of the sea from Atlas soars, Or Teneriffe's hoar peak, and stretches far Above the Atlantic wave, contemning distance. The watchful helmsman from the stern descries, And hails her course, and many an eye is raised. Loftier she flies than hundred times mast-height: Onward she floats, then plunges from her soar Down to the ship, as if she aimed to perch Upon the mainmast pinnacle; but up again She mounts Alp high, and, with her lowered head Suspended, eyes the bulging sails, disdains Their tardy course, outflies the hurrying rack, And, disappearing, mingles with the clouds.

Elizabeth enters, with her Train. Walks to a Chair of State. Melvil kneels, and rises. Eliz. You are welcome, Melvil. Mel. God save your Highness! Eliz. How fares the Queen of Scots, our much-loved sister? Mel. As captive queens are wont. Eliz. Still in the castle of Lochleven isle? Mel. Still there she languishes. Alas! to her Day after day forms but one tedious night Of gloomy suffering, with scarce a hope Of dawn, unless your Highness interpose In her behalf. O! did you but behold That beauteous, fading form— Eliz. And is that form as fair as rumour says? Mel. She is so fair—words cannot tell how fair! Eliz. Describe this paragon. Mel. Describe!— Eliz. Try, try; I'll question you. Mel. It is in vain. Eliz. Her brow? Mel. 'Tis seldom seen, save when the zephyr parts The raven lock, that as in envy shades it. Eliz. What foolery!— [Aside. Her eye? Mel. A middle 'tween the falcon's and the dove's. Eliz. Her cheek? Mel. An opening wild rose, of the faintest blush. In each the slightest smile a dimple shows,— The Scylla and Charybdis of the Loves, In which unwary hearts sad shipwreck meet. Eliz. How sounds her voice? Mel. In speech, gentle as when the west wind's breath Sighs through the new-downed willow leaves; in song Mellifluous, full, then floating,—floating soft As Echo answering Philomela's plaint. Eliz. And does she touch the harp with equal skill? Mel. The chords, though struck with careless sweep, speak love, Like Cupid's wing along Apollo's lyre; And with the notes so sweet is blent her voice In magic harmony, that none may know Which is the voice, and which the silver string. Eliz. Good, good: That she excels (Although your words sound more like love than truth) In each external grace, we know:—But tell me, Is she much versed in languages? Mel. She speaks the tongues of Scotland and of France With equal grace: Italia's is her sport: Each dialect her people use she knows; And to the humblest she so suits her phrase, That rustic maids, at first abashed, look up, Thinking they hear a sister-cottager. Eliz. And is she liberal, as becomes a queen? Mel. Her hand is Heaven; her charity On the receiver falls darkling, like dew On flowers, unseen from whence, yet weighing down, With overloaded cup, their bending stalks. Eliz. But is she just, as generous? What she gives Belongs not to herself, but to the state. Mel. She has—she had—her own, the royal lands. Eliz. But tell me, Melvil, Does your fair mistress poise the scales of justice With even hand—like me, with steady hand? Mel. Yes, she is just; but yet—mercy too oft Inclines the balance wrong. I have beheld This beauteous Queen half kneel, with eyes suffused, Praying her surly chancellor to stop The warrant winged with death; and she would lay Her hand on his, with softly-pleading pressure, Until she saw his fixed regard relax Into a smile contending with a frown. But if a judge (and she was eagle-eyed) Were found perverting justice 'gainst the poor, Her look how changed! Not the famed censor's brow, When dashing from the tablet venal names, Was e'er more sternly knit. Eliz. Which is more fair, the Queen of Scots or I? Mel. She within Scotland's realm, in England you. Eliz. To-morrow here we shall concert What should be done for your much-injured mistress, Our dearest sister. Farewell.— [Exit Melvil. Aye, let her pine until her radiant eyes Sink lustreless, till fades the rose's glow. No more shall silent crowds hang on her smile; Bent o'er the watery mirror that surrounds her, Herself shall be her sole idolater: There to her answering image she may pour The unavailing incense of her tears.— Enter Cecil. What from the Commons House? It is my will That the five leaders of the mutiny Enjoy their privilege of speech, their freedom Within the liberties of London Tower. I called them for their money, not advice. Go, let my order instant be obeyed. But, Cecil, stay—The Queen of Scots, our sister, Has suffered now enough: What shall be done To succour so much beauty in distress? Cecil. Her husband's murderess! The foiled usurper of your diadem! Remember how she quartered England's arms On Scotland's shield. One crown was not enough, And ne'er will be, for her o'ergrown ambition. Remember, too, she has— A son, who will inherit her ambition And her claims. Eliz. But would you let her languish in a prison, Till youth and beauty fade? Think, could you bear To see my fate the same? Ah! could you see My cheek grow pale! the lustre of— Cecil. No, that can never be; no change of fortune Could e'er impair such peerless charms as yours; Beauty that— But I must haste to expedite the warrants. Eliz. Stay, stay, good Cecil, stay a little while. What was you just about to say? Cecil. I must be gone. Eliz. Nay, Cecil, gentle Cecil, stay one instant. Cecil. No, no, the prating rebels may escape. [Exit. Eliz. I've acted well: He does not see how much I hate this queen, this paragon: His words Were all superfluous to such hate as mine. She has a son—I need none to remind me: She is a mother—May her infant perish! And her next bantling be—yes, may it be Some biform monster, for her double crown, And born with power of speech, to curse its birth! [Exit. SCENE II. —Lochleven Island. (Time—Sunset.) Enter Douglas and Montgomery, meeting. Mont. What, just from Stirling?—Is the infant crowned? Doug. How is the Queen?—a queen no more:—and Adelaide? Mont. I think they're yonder on the terrace—No, That cannot be the Queen. Doug. It is—for that I'm sure is Adelaide. The Queen ne'er leans on any other arm Save Adelaide's. O, what a friend is there! So young, so stedfast, born to wealth and power, Preferring still a prison with her friend To all the mirth and revelry of France. Mont. I ne'er could think she was of foreign lineage; She speaks as ours had been her native tongue. Doug. From earliest years she was the Queen's companion. I've heard her say, her first embroidery Was the joint labour of the Queen and her; And, with prophetic fondness, in the work They entertwined the letters of their names. But sure you jest in saying that her speech Is free from foreign accent? Mont. At times I think it is discernible. Doug. No, it is not; or, if at all discerned, 'Tis but a hesitation in some words, Which hang most prettily between her lips, Like new-fledged birds, when from their native rosebush They fluttering stoop to try their timorous wings. Mont. I fear her words have nestled in thy heart. Doug. 'Tis even so; my thoughts are all of her. Montgomery, I will trust thee:— Oft for her sake I've formed the perilous plan To aid the Queen's escape—'Tis in my power. Say, will you share the generous enterprise? Mont. Think, Douglas, ere you act; your brother's life Might be the forfeit of the Queen's escape. And what your recompence for all the risk? Trust me, you but contrive your own dispeace. Beware, while yet 'tis time; for, though she's humble, The heiress of the noble Count Verneúil, So near allied to the royal house of France, She would disdain a nameless gentleman. Doug. And I disdain the motive you surmise. However much I love, she ne'er shall know; No word, no whisper, sigh, or look, shall hint it. But is it possible she should believe That my design could ever have its rise In some base, grovelling, interested purpose, Some distant vista of her rich demesnes? 'Tis possible— Rather than undergo such degradation In her fair judgment, Honour's holiest temple,— Mont. Perhaps I err; perhaps she'd ne'er admit One thought detractive of your worth. Doug. And shall my honour hang on a perhaps? But granting that, to liberty restored, She should absolve me of all selfish ends, What then? Perhaps I might receive her thanks, United with the thanks of some great lord, To whom she had resigned her new-gained freedom: While I, poor I, perhaps should be a guest, A humble guest, may be, allowed to strut A puppet in the hymeneal pageant. No, no, she still must wear this watery chain. Mont. Douglas, I pity thee. Doug. Pity! for what? By day I here behold Beauty which makes these beauteous scenes seem tame; And when the night enshrouds that prison tower, I bask me in the taper's ray that shoots From Adelaide's iron casement thwart the gloom. Here, here she shall remain. Mont. They come this way. Doug. O, what a grace adorns her every motion! Here—no, this is no place for thee—I will Thou shouldst be free—I will it. Mont. Be calm, I pray; they're near. Doug. Her eye!— Enter Mary and Adelaide. Mary. 'Tis of the coronation that you speak? What news from Stirling castle? How did the crown Befit the baby's brow? Speak freely all. Doug. An please your Grace, I must speak sadly then; Yet 'tis soon told. Your son was crowned king Of Scotland, Mona, and the Hebrid isles. It was, in truth, a childish ceremony. Mary. Who held The mother's crown above her infant's head? Doug. Knox;—and, as he held it up, He smiled contempt upon the kingly bauble. Mary. Who gave the sceptre? Doug. It was not given. Mary. How? Doug. What cannot be received cannot be given: 'Twas but presented by the Earl of Ross. The infant stretched its little hand and smiled, Then cried to see the glittering toy withdrawn. Mary. O that I had been there to soothe my child! May be I might have been allowed to kiss The tear from off his cheek:—No, no, the touch Would taint him with my faith, my wretched faith. O that the haughty Murray would permit A mother once again to see her child! But just once more to lift his cradle veil! Perhaps he'd smile: Remembrance of that smile Might serve to cheer my gloomy prison hours. O were I but his nurse! what happiness!— 'Tis not allowed: A mother not allowed To be her infant's nurse! Doug. Barbarity! Monstrous barbarity! Mary. No voice, no angel's voice, Can like a mother's sing her child to sleep. Doug. Shall Murray's fiat cancel nature's law? Mary. Look down and see in circling flight that lark, Reflected in the bosom of the lake; It has a home; it is allowed to stretch Its pinions o'er its young. Doug. You shall be free. Mont. I vow you shall be free. Mary. I ask not liberty; I could submit, Like any captive slave, to tend my son: But this cannot be hoped from Murray's pity; From him who tore me from my child; who wrenched My finger from his clinging hand, Which with its feeble grasp seemed to beseech That I would not forsake him: Then I thought, Perhaps this orphan hand may one day hold The avenging sword o'er tyrant Murray's head. Doug. I'll serve your Highness with my life. Mont. And I. Mary. Think not of serving me; I've now no power To give rewards; I am no more a queen. Look at yon lily through my window bars, ,Tis withering apace; it has no root:— I am that rootless flower;— Think not of serving me; I have no recompence to offer you. Doug. We wish for none—You know us not. I could— But have you courage? Wish you to be free? Mary. What do you mean?—free! O, free! Doug. I could inform your Highness of some things That nearly do concern your freedom. Mary. What?—say! Adel. Say—O speak! Doug. Each night some trusty friends on yonder shore In secret lurk, ready to aid your flight. 'Tis scarce an hour since, when about to cross, I communed with the Earl of Arran's brother. We had been friends even from our boyish days;— He trusted me:—This night it is his turn To watch within St Servan's wood:—He brings A wing-hoofed courser for your majesty. Adel. God bless the youth, the gallant Hamilton! Doug. And yet there is great hazard in the attempt. What if it should misgive?—I lose my life. That to be sure is nothing; but your Grace Would be a sufferer too; and you, fair lady, Should know that, if we fail, her Grace's durance Would then be doubly rigid.—Could you attend Your royal friend into a dungeon-vault? Adel. Aye, to the bottom of the vilest cavern; Where toads would loath to dwell, where tapers die, My friendship's fire would then but blaze more brightly. Doug. Fear not, the risk is small; you shall, you shall Be free; yes! you shall meet your gallant Hamilton, But if it should misgive,—the risk—You lose The little liberty which here you have. Perhaps they'd banish you to some far shore:— Shut in a tower in some lone sea-girt isle, Beholding through the spray-worn prison grate No sight but waves, or sky, or distant sail; Hearing no sound but of the weary surge, With now and then the sea-mew's passing scream, Borne down the wind,— Ah! then you would lament that e'er you left This pretty islet, where you seem to dwell In durance sweet, like some benighted bee Pent in a flower-bell at the close of eve.— But yet, an' please your Grace, if 'tis your will [To the Queen. To brave the danger which I have described, Our service (for Montgomery too I vouch) Is yours. The castle keys are in my keeping:— Ere midnight, if you will, your way is free: I'll lead you through the postern to this spot;— And to yon elm-roots I have moored a skiff. Mary. (After a pause.) And I will trust you.— What say you, Adelaide? Adel. I too will trust you. Doug. I see the Lady of Lochleven come With chiding face. Be ye prepared. [Exeunt Douglas and Montgomery. Enter Lady Leven. Leven. Madam, your hour is out—you'll please return; And, if you'll lay aside that crucifix, That monstrous emblem of idolatry, You'll be permitted to attend The exhortations of a holy man. The hour of prayer draws nigh;—your soul, Your shipwrecked soul, may yet be saved, If pride will let you hear the words of life: Your prayer might reach the throne of grace, if borne Upon the breathings of a soul elect. Mary. The supplications of the wretched reach The God of mercies, though not winged with words Of holy men. Leven. You must, you shall attend. Mary. Will you not give the freedom which you ask? Say which religion acts the tyrant now? Leven. Your tyranny had nigh o'erthrown the law Of God and man; ours is the hallowed cause Of liberty and pure religion; yours Of superstition and despotic sway. Mary. O, liberty! What crimes are acted in thy sacred name! In thy insignia scarfed, how monsters riot! With clouds of incense stolen from thy shrine, They veil their horrible Atean orgies, And with thy pæans drown the victim's voice. Leven. Haste to thy chamber, else I'll dash Thy idol cross upon the ground, and tear That rosary for playthings to my boys. Mary. I go—I'm in your power. Adel. A day of retribution yet will come. [Aside. Leven. Haste, muttering minion, to thy chamber. [Exeunt Mary and Adelaide, followed by Lady Leven. SCENE III. —Shore of the main Land between St Servan's Wood and the Lake. (Time—Night.) Enter Montgomery, looking round. Hamilton seen in the back Ground. Ham. Who comes? Mont. Is it Lord Hamilton who speaks? Ham. Aye, and Montgomery's friend. Are all things ready? Mont. All right. You'll see the Queen—'tis near the time: Where are the horses? Ham. Behind these trees; listen, the night's so still, You'll hear them browsing on the dewy blade. Mont. They are not loose? Ham. No, no, they're led. I would the Queen were mounted. Mont. It is full time. Ham. I dread cross accidents—Look, see yon lights! Mont. That! Ham. But hist!—a dash and motion in the lake! The stars that in it shone so steadily, See how they dance—The boat is surely off. Mont. 'Tis but the springing of the sportive fry. I wish indeed we heard the dash of oars. Ham. But list again. Mont. Yes, now I think I hear the joyful sound— It is—they're safe—I hear the quick-plied oars: You'll see anon the little bark approach. Alas! how changed the royal equipage From what it was upon that jubilee day, When Mary Stewart, in a barge of state, Approached the Lothian beach! Graceful she stood, With one hand clasped around the rose-wreathed post, Which o'er her head upheld a silken sky, Tinged faintly with a broken-vaulted rainbow. At intervals was heard a quire of flutes, Breathing such lays!— The listening waves seemed music lulled, heaving With noiseless swell, that gently raised And yet half yielded 'neath the gilded prow. Then what a shout! as kneeled the beauteous Queen, Weeping with joy, to kiss her native soil! The flowers, tear-sprinkled, sprung to meet her lips, And wreathed themselves into her floating tresses. Rising, she clasped her hands, and looked to heaven. O! 'twas a day of which, from sun to sun, I ne'er should tire to speak. But see, they near— Woes me, how changed!—stealing away by night. Ham. They come, they come; there, look—how near the shore. I think I see a moving darkness—a cloud Swift gliding o'er the inverted galaxy, In quick succession hiding the deep stars. Mont. They near—how fast they near—their voices—list!— That soothing voice is Adelaide's; she's cheering The doubting spirits of the Queen. Ham. What means that gleamy waving in the gloom? Mont. 'Twill be her Highness' hand signing the cross. Haste, let us welcome them—I see they mean To land upon the rock. [Exeunt. (Noise, Voices heard.)—Re-enter Hamilton and Montgomery, with Mary and Adelaide, Douglas and Fishermen. Mary. Mother of God, I thank thee! Adel. Holy Virgin! Doug. Rest for a moment on this mossy plat. Adel. Is it your Grace's pleasure here to stop? Mary. No, not one instant. The alarm was given ere we had midway come; I heard the clanking of the draw-bridge chains; And see yon crossing lights along the island! Doug. Fear not. Mary. The shadow of a tree, Or even the rustling of a single leaf, Or trickling of a dewdrop, Would make me quake: My mind, alas! 'tis crushed; Captivity has quite unnerved my soul. Where are we going? Ham. To Hamilton; your Highness' friends are there. Mary. O take me to my child; he's with his foes: Remove me on a bier to where he is: I dare not sit a fiery courser now. Adel. Think, Mary, Queen of Scots; act like yourself; You'll not undo what now is half achieved. To horse! you now are, if you will, a queen. Your people's welfare summons you to act. Mary. Yes, Now I feel I'm free—again a queen; Prince of a people, generous, brave, and free. Quick, let us hence. [Exeunt. END OF ACT FIRST. ACT II. SCENE I. —Glasgow—Archbishop's Castle. (Time—Evening.) Murray and Glencairn. Glen. The Queen's force doubles ours; And, for the town, I've seen a sheep-fold with as stout a wall. In Stirling we might wait the expected succours. I vote retreat. Mur. You think not what a palsying power there is In that poor word retreat. Let us present A show of confidence; let us at least Await my son's return: Perhaps the terms We've offered may procure at least delay. He must be here ere long. Glen. He might have gone and come twice ere this time. I think 'twas hardly noon when he departed. Mur. Unless unlooked mischance has happened him, He will be here anon. Glen. It were no wonder if Mary's counsellors Should violate their own safe conduct. Mur. Aye, think you so?—No, no, it cannot be. Though wicked, they are wise, and must forecast The possibility of a reverse. And yet I wish I saw my son again. Enter Stewart. What staid thee, boy? I would not bear One hour of such disquietude (Think not, forsooth, it was on thy account) For Scotland's crown itself. Stew. I have had much to see, and hear, and say. Mur. Now thou hast but to say; without more preface, Give us a full relation of thy mission. Stew. When I arrived at Hamilton, the Queen— Mur. What mean you by the Queen? Stew. Well, Mary Stewart, if so be your will, Was at the palace gate. Mur. I ask not where she was; I want to know What friends were with her. Stew. She had some noble ladies in her suite, Besides some gallant gentlemen: She seemed— Mur. I ask not what she seemed; tell me at once Who seemed to be most in her confidence. Stew. Lord Hamilton he held her horse's rein; And Douglas led her down the palace stair. Mur. Where was the Earl of Arran? Stew. The barons, with their vassals, were arrayed Upon the plain where Aven joins the Clyde: The Queen was going thither. Mur. The Queen! Stew. Lord Hamilton, to whom I told my errand, Permitted me to follow in the train, And promised me an answer should be given Soon as the muster of the host was o'er. I went— Glen. 'Twas fortunate you went—you'll know their numbers. Mur. Glencairn, thou'rt always thinking of their numbers: I'd rather ask how armed, how disciplined; Whether their hearts and souls are in the cause? Stew. As for their discipline, it seemed but rude; But for their hearts, I am concerned to say, In number many, they are yet but one, Glowing with zeal in Mary Stewart's cause: And well they may; For well she knows, and practises each art To win mens' love. She wore a crown of bays Begemmed with primroses; and in the front A thistle-sprig appeared, as if to say, This emblem, dear to Scotland, still I prize The brightest jewel of my diadem: In her right hand, ungloved, a sword she bore, While with her left she reined her pawing steed, As passed the several clans. She knew the name Of every chief; to each one's homage bowed, Then kissed her hilt: But when the Douglasses Advanced, she stooped so low, her lovely locks, Disordered with the wind, were seen to join Her charger's flowing mane. When all had passed, They formed a ring around this fair Bellona; Then she harangued them with a modest boldness: She spoke of English arts, and English gold; And vowed she would not see her realm reduced To be a province of a foreign queen. Mur. How were these lies received? Stew. By all with mute attention; you might have heard The gentle kissing of the joining streams. Even those beyond the hearing of her words Did bend their heads, delighted with the music: The sound was pleasant, though unknown the strain. Mur. I think the sorceress hath bewitched thee too. Stew. None, while they look on her, may say they hate. Mur. She is a hypocrite. Stew. She said, For Scotland I would shed my blood, As Wallace did, upon an English scaffold, As did my grandsire upon Flodden field, As did your ancestors at Bannockburn. At this, as if one impulse ruled the whole, Ten thousand swords flashed in the setting sun: She, starting at the friendly gleam, betrayed That still she was no heroine at heart. Mur. I see thou'rt tainted; I will not believe Thy overcharged account; thou but describest The feelings of thy own perverted mind. But say, what homage next was paid This patriot Queen? It could be nothing less Than bearing home her Highness on their shields. Stew. No, she returned on horseback, as she went, I saw her now and then amid the throng: 'Mong the dark-visaged Douglasses, she seemed A lonely star amid the hurrying clouds, Seen but by glimpses. Mur. Spare thy similitudes, and give us facts. What were their numbers? Stew. Some twelve or thirteen thousand. Mur. 'Tis false, they are not five.— [Pausing. The Lennox-men will sure be here ere morning. What do you think, my Lords! They'll sure be here—. Glen. Not quite so soon. Mur. But what said Mary Stewart to our terms? Stew. She called me gentle cousin; and, when I kneeled, She took me by the hand, and bid me rise: She looked at me with such a piteous look, As if mistrustful of her new-gained power: 'Twas such a look As might have melted treason's ice-cased heart. Mur. Fool! thou'rt no son of mine:—Come to the point. What answer did she give to our conditions? Stew. A positive refusal. She stipulated, that we should confess Her abdication was the effect of force. The settlement of past disputes, she said, She willingly would leave to the estates: Her people might dethrone her if they willed; A foreign faction never. She owned her people had a right to choose Their own religious faith; and though she wished To turn them from the error of their way, She'd ne'er adopt compulsion for persuasion. Mur. What said she to our offers of a passport? Stew. I asked her if she wished to pass to France; At which she smiled, and said, Go, tell your father, That Mary Stewart is—the Queen of Scotland. Glen. What now is left for us but to retreat? Mur. I will agree, that, if the Lennox-men Do not arrive ere morn, we shall retreat. Glen. It is agreed then that we shall retreat? Mur. Yes, if we're disappointed of the succours. But it is time we visited the posts; We'll find, I fear, some of the warding burgesses Are fast asleep ere now, dreaming perhaps, In horror, that they hear the trumpet's charge, While nothing's heard save their own lullaby. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A Room of State in Hamilton Palace. Mary, Adelaide, and Douglas. Mary. They're gone.— [Looking towards the Entrance of the Stage. O regal state, a cumb'rous garb thou art! Arran I love; I love his lady too; And yet I'm glad they're gone. I feel now light With you, my friends, my chosen, well-tried friends. Adel. Poor gratitude—It is a term too faint— Your Highness ought to love Lord Hamilton. Doug. Without Lord Hamilton your Grace might still Have been a prisoner—You ought to love him; And you, my Lady Adelaide, you too. Adel. And so I do; I love him as a brother. Doug. And something more. Adel. He was but second in the enterprize. [To Douglas. Mary. By break of day, you said, The council have resolved we march.— The Regent dare not meet us, or, if he dare,— He'll meet his ruin.—To-morrow night we reach The two-peaked rock.—Good evening, Douglas: You'll arm betimes. Doug. God save your Grace!—God bless you, lady! [Exit Douglas. Mary. See if my chamber's lighted. [Exit Adel. No, Adelaide, thou must not learn— There are some things which, even in the ear Of sacred friendship, never may be breathed: O that it were to do!—consent!—O, no! Denial then should not be simple nay; My prayers, my threats, my power should interpose: I'd rush in at the death-impending moment; Even while the murderer, with averted face, Breathless, stretched out his trembling hand, I'd from it dash the hell-lighted match. Darnley, still wilt thou look upon me so! Yes, look, aye, frown reproach, while conscience smiles, I'm innocent. I feel I am not guilty. Abused, dishonoured, outraged, yea, despised! A queen despised! dishonoured! by the man Whom she had lifted to her throne!— Wretch! he deserved His fate. In slaughtering Rizzio in my presence, His deep-laid purpose was a double murder:— And then to step into the vacant throne; His dripping dagger glittered in my eye— Wretch! he deserved to die! The law was palsied— The hand of justice struck—and was I bound To thrust my arm between him and the stroke? To act, to speak, to warrant by a hint,— That had been wrong: But I—what was't I did? I only did not take into my bosom The viper that had stung me to the heart. Yes, look, aye, haunt me with that look, Thou vision, dream, thou phantasm of my brain! Sure it can be nought else; 'tis nothing real; [Looking round. And if it were, proud spirit, I would dare thee: At deepest midnight, in the charnel aisle, I would not dread to meet thee: Thy crimes, my wrongs, Would nerve this feeble frame, would to my tongue Lend utterance, till such a tale I told, Would make thee glad again to pall Thy face confused, and shrink into the tomb. Do I dream?—O, I'm weak—I'm miserable! Re-enter Adelaide. Adel. Why do you look so joyless 'mid the hope Which with still brightening ray spreads all around? Mary. With brightening ray! With me hope shines but faintly. Adel. What were you brooding on when I returned? Mary. Nothing—something—no, nothing. Adel. Am I your friend? am I your Adelaide? Now tell me, Mary, (for by that dear name I ne'er addressed you that I asked in vain,) Come tell me, Mary, what you thought upon? Mary. Nothing—nothing indeed. Adel. You know not how I love to share your sorrow. Mary. 'Twas nothing—'twas a prayer. Adel. Were not we fellow-captives in Lochleven? Mary. Dear Adelaide, I thought of thee: I feared lest Douglas loved thee. Adel. Fear not for that; I'm sure he loves not me. What makes your Grace imagine he loves me? 'Tis certain you're deceived. Me loved of Douglas! No, no, he loves not me. I fain would know What ground you have for such a strange suspicion. Mary. He is your constant shadow; He's seen but in the sunshine of your smile; And when a frowning cloud lowers o'er your eyes, He's gone. You are too harsh. Adel. It is your Grace he loves. How few there be That see your Highness, and escape unwounded! Mary. Nay, Adelaide,—love lives not without hope. Adel. Therefore 'tis sure that Douglas loves not me. Mary. Despair sometimes puts on the smile of hope. Enter Hamilton. Ham. Your Highness' council is again assembled Upon another message that arrived, Some half hour since, from Murray's quarters; They want your approbation to their answer. Shall they attend your Highness here? Mary. I'll go to them. O, if it be of peace, My joy-marred tongue will faulter in reply, But my glad heart will echo back the word, Peace!—word to mothers dear. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —The Bank of the River below Glasgow. Enter three Burgesses, a Barber, a Gardener, and a Tailor. Barb. You two watch here till the morning bugle tells the sun to get up; and hear me, you are not to step a hairbreadth below the old willow, nor farther up than that grey thorn there; and as soon as ever you hear the Lennox men coming, look sharp, run up to the water port, and tell the news. [Exit. Tail. It will soon be morning now. Gard. Morning! and so many stars in the water. Tail. I think I see a long shred of red far in the east. Gard. I wish I saw it. I'm weary of this work. I wonder how it is to end. I hope the Queen will get her own again. Tail. How dare ye venture to think or speak such a wish? Gard. It is not to every body I would venture; but are not you my friend? Tail. Yes, yes, you are safe enough with me. Gard. What think you of the Queen now? Tail. I fear she knew something of Darnley's murder; but what's ten times worse, they say she prays to a picture. Gard. Would you believe her to be a murderer? Such a face never belonged to a murderer. I saw her on her way to Cruickston with Darnley. Did you not see her? Tail. No; I never saw her. Gard. Both old and young ran out to gaze at her. Tail. The fairest skin may hide a cruel heart. Gard. A cruel heart! She would not hurt a midge's wing. I remember, that time she went to Cruickston, your King Darnley flew a hawk at a bird, but the Queen made the falconer try to lure her back; but on she flew, (I thought the Queen's eye would have darted after her with very earnestness,) and still they flew and flew till the bird was out o' sight, and the hawk as small as the bird, and next the hawk by little and little melted away; but at last she came back, and then if ye had seen how blythe the Queen's eye glistened, when she saw neither blood nor feathers on the hooked beak. She could not bear to think the poor bird was killed, and can ye trow she would kill her husband? Tail. Yes, I can trow it; he was too good to live. Gard. I'll tell you what that husband did;—he smiled a bitter smile of spite, and set the panting tarsel upon the Queen's bare arm till the blood sprang at each talon, and stained her lily skin;—I saw a tear run down her cheek, like a dew-drop on a wild rose, but I thought it was rather a tear of joy for the bird's escape, than of grief for herself; and then she hooded the hawk with her own hand. Tail. Some say she paints her cheek. Gard. Who would e'er paint a flower? You never saw her. Her cheek! the fading of the red into the white is a colour like nothing I have seen, unless it be hoar frost on a rose. Tail. She will cost many a brave man his life. Gard. That is too true; but see, the morning now is dawning; yon ruddy glow foreruns the sun; and hark! the mavis chaunt. Tail. It is time we should be gone. Gard. Before we go, I'll venture past our ward down to yon broomy brae, to pull a sprig for our little Jonny's new bonnet; the boys are all a-soldiering now o' days, and he is captain of his company; he'll be right proud of such a pretty plume. Tail. Stop, stop; I hear a sound far down the water. Gard. Can it be—(Listening)—the stroke of oars? Tail. The Lennox men, I hope;—it is;—Do not you hear the rowers' timing chaunt? Gard. I hear something like music. Tail. Hear how it swells. [Music heard, indistinctly at first; then “Lochaber no more.” Gard. (After a listening pause.) Aye; some of you will never return to your heathery braes. There will be many a fatherless child before that sun sets again. Tail. They come but slowly; I wish a breeze would spring to help them on; but there's not a breath of wind. [Music ceases. Gard. See yonder, their drooping streamers upon the mast-tops peering through the mist. Tail. There, there, the foremost bow comes bulging into view; look, look, the naked knees and tartan hose. It is the Lennox men. Haste, let us tell the welcome news. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. —Glasgow. The Castle. Murray sitting thoughtful. Enter Crawford. Crawf. Good morrow to your Highness. What answer to our second offer? Mur. None yet. I fear they have detained Our messenger. Crawf. The Lennox men are not arrived. Mur. I'm confident they will be here ere long. Crawf. Who would depend upon the wind and tide? Mur. Aye, there the folly of old Lennox shines. His torpid soul all action seems to hate: The motion of the gentlest ambling palfrey Is all too rough for him. To save his life He'd lift, but lift reluctantly, his arm. I do believe that if he were embarked, And set adrift above some cataract, He'd sit with folded arms, gliding along, And listen to the swelling roar, and then perhaps, With lazy listless hand, take up the oars, And slowly ply, until he gained the bank. Crawf. Why do you trust to him? Mur. I do not trust to him. There's one I trust,— Pharlan's brave chief, who, if it rest with him, Will not come late to any warlike tryst. Crawf. I wish your confidence may prove wellplaced. Enter Stewart. Stew. The Lennox men are come—five hundred strong. Mur. God bless the day! Stewart, dispatch the letter, The letter to Throgmorton; haste. All goes just as I wish. Enter Glencairn. Where have you been, Glencairn? what is the matter? Glen. I thought it best To go myself to gain intelligence Touching the force the Queen brings to the field; But ere I had arrived at Bothwell ford, I thought I heard, as from the other side, A strange and mingled sound, with now and then Some voices louder than the rest: The mist Was floating thick, and nothing could be seen, Save here and there the gleam of a spear point, Or gilded banner, like lightning from a cloud. Instant I turned, and on the spur am come. It must have been the Queen and all her power; It could be nothing less; 'twas like the rush Of rivers— Mur. I know the route they'll take: we must prevent them: They'll pass between the Roman camp and Cart, Unless we stop their course: Langside's the ground That we must seize: no time is to be lost. The burgesses must muster in the green. Meantime, Glencairn, hasten with all your men: You'll occupy the post that I have mentioned: You'll find some of your friends already there. The Queen will find I've been before-hand with her. [Exeunt Mur. Crawf. and Glen. Enter the Duke of Lennox, with Highlanders. Len. Where is the Regent? Stew. My lord, it is the Regent's pleasure, That with two hundred of your friends, to whom There will be joined two hundred burgesses, You guard the town. Len. God's blessing on you, sir; we will obey you. Follow, my friends. [Exeunt. SCENE V. —The Castle-hill of Cathcart. The Queen seated. Adelaide, Douglas, and Attendants, standing around. Doug. Do not despond: look what a gallant host Awaits your Highness's command to sweep The wavering rebel mob from yonder hill. Mary. Douglas, I never thought to see the day, When all a woman and a queen holds dear Upon the chance of battle should be staked. But surely they will not refuse our terms. Doug. No, no; our terms are backed by arguments Of weight and force not easily withstood. Mary. I fear, I fear. Adel. Do not despond when fortune seems to smile. Think what and where we were a few days since: Now we are free, and freedom of itself, How dear to them who e'er have known its loss! Besides our freedom is secured by power: Meet fortune then, so newly reconciled, With smiles, and not with sighs, and doubts, and fears. Mary. None of the Stewarts e'er was fortunate; Or on the field, or by the assassin's stroke, Or on the feverous, the pall-curtained bed Of disappointment, all my forefathers died. Enter Argyle. Arg. Now we might force their lines; my life upon't We now might do it; but, while we pause, They're strengthening every point: Let us attack. Mary. No, I'm resolved, whatever be the event, To wait the issue of our last proposal; Who knows but it may be the means of peace. Arg. Since that's your will, I must be gone; your men Are eager for the fight; perhaps they'll slip The leash, unless I aid my son's weak hold: 'Twas all I could to make them say they'd wait Until I should receive your Highness' orders. [Exit. Mary. How much is lost, how little gained by war! I'd rather lose my crown than see one child Made fatherless, one woman made a widow, One mother mourn a son, one maid a lover, Or even than a friendless man be missed By his poor dog. My crown! I care not for thee! Poor bauble, go and grace my baby's brow. Doug. I must away: See how the Regent's force Is spreading wider down along the slope. This is no time for Douglas to be idle. Adel. O wait until the answer— Doug. They're answering with their trumpets: Hear the charge! Adel. Perhaps it is a herald sounding peace. Doug. See yonder, rising from behind the brow, The other and the other floating banner: The English company now comes in view. Perhaps a Percy leads them on. I must, I must away. Adel. And will you leave us unprotected? Doug. You see those guards all stationed round the hill. Adel. They are not near enough: O, Douglas, stay! Do you not fear to die? Doug. Against my countrymen my arm is weak, As is my heart; but when a foreign foe Invades that soil, whence freedom's living bulwarks Long, long repelled the ocean waves of power, My heart, my strength, my soul, is in my sword; All dread of death then dies; and his dark frowns,— Which in the puny times of peace appalled,— Seem now like recollections of the shapes That wont to haunt our childish fantasies;— We hold them in derision, perfect scorn. All balancing, all doubts are fled;—to plunge Into the tide of war is now the wish Of every heart, burning to drink revenge. Who, who would bear to see these blood-bought vales, These woods,—the very hills where Wallace trode, And looked around, and saw his country freed, Freed by his heaven-raised arm,—to see these fields In foreign thrall!—I must be gone. Adel. Stay just but till you clasp your hauberk close. Enter Argyle, Hamilton, and Attendants. Arg. Douglas, remain. [To Doug. Mary. Argyle, O speak! say, is it peace or war? Arg. The enemy refuse all terms of peace, [To the Queen. But such as cannot be consented to,— Your Grace's banishment. Mary. And is there not a place for Mary Stewart In her son's kingdom? I'll be content to hold A private station for the sake of peace. Arg. Their sentence is your banishment. Mary. Then be it war! I ne'er could bear to see Injustice done the lowest of my people; I have a right to justice in my turn. Nor is the quarrel personal to me: Behold yon English standard,—'tis the aim Of England's Queen to subjugate our country. Force oft has failed; now she resorts to art, Foments division, joins this side, then that, And when the realm, with self-inflicted wounds, Enfeebled lies, she'll bind it with a chain: But I, for one, will never wear that chain; I'll gladly give this little-valued life A chance to 'scape from bondage. I this day Join in the ranks: Though feeble be my arm, Though inexpert in the death-dealing art, My presence, I foresee, will save some friends, By turning many an English shaft from men Who have some ties that make them love to live. Mine are all sundered. O, I would kiss the fledge Of the blest shaft that quivered in my breast. Arg. You cannot go; your Highness cannot go; Were it no more, you have not strength to rein Your charger through the battle's furious rush. Mary. Give me a lance, and girth old Barbary: Bothwell he often bore through deadly fields: I'll trust myself to him; and mounted thus, I do not fear to ford a river of blood. Arg. Think, think, I pray your Grace. Mary. My Lord, I'll ride by you; you on my right, And Douglas on my left. Arg. Your Highness knows not what you do; you risk, In hazarding yourself, the safety of your country: Besides, though you should 'scape unhurt, Think what a loss of life the very sight Of such a prize would cost. Each leaguer's heart That now beats languid in the Regent's cause, Would leap with eagerness to take the Queen. Mary. Might not my presence and my words disarm Some wavering hearts? Arg. No, no;—but reasoning here is out of place; It is my will—I here hold the command— Your Highness shall remain upon this spot. Though absent, you shall see that in our hearts Your presence lives. Give us your prayers. Farewell. Mary. I do beseech— Arg. No— Mary. Since that it must be so, may God preserve My people. Ah me! both armies are my people. Arg. You'll have the Regent in your tent ere night. Adel. Will not my Lord leave some one of our friends To wait upon the Queen? Douglas, perhaps, Or some one else? Doug. I would not stay behind, although the Queen, Although thyself entreated me. Farewell. Arg. Lord Hamilton, you shall attend her Highness. Ham. I, my Lord! Arg. You must; you know the consequence Of disobedience. [Exeunt Argyle, Attendants, and Douglas. Adel. O that I had my sun-burnt vassals here! They loved me well; a single look from me, A wave of this weak hand, would make them join Right merrily the Morrice Dance of Death. They'd be the pioneers of your brave Scots, And clear yon speary hedges from the hill. Mary. Ah me! that trumpet clang!—my heart is sick. And now they move—how many to their death! O haste, Lord Hamilton,—say, 'tis my will A message on the instant should be sent, Acceding to the Regent's rigorous terms. I'm willing to be banished this dear land. Ham. 'Tis now too late to stop your Highness' men In their career: you might as lief attempt To rein the lion by his bristling mane, Or catch him in a net of gossamer, When springing on his prey. Adel. Mother of God!—the Douglasses in front!— See, see the Bruce's heart, as in the breeze Their standards wave! Ham. Would I were there!—There happy Douglas cries, “Move on as thou wast wont to do, and Douglas “Will follow thee, or die.” Adel. Die! Mary. What a small space between the fronting lines! Oh me! most wretched! I, I am the cause. Ham. Your Grace's enemies,—they are the cause. Mary. I dare no longer look; O take me hence. Ham. You must not leave this spot; there's many an eye Looks backward now and then upon this hill, And, seeing you, turns fiercely to the foe, With forward-darting look of eagerness, To dash among your Highness' enemies. Mary. Adelaide, give me thy hand to grasp in mine; Or do but lean it kindly on my shoulder, That I may feel the touch of one I love. Speak, O speak to me. Adel. All will go well. Mary. No victory, though gained without the loss (O were it possible!) of friend or foe— What a dread trumpet clang! [Stooping and covering her Eyes with her hand, Adelaide kneeling at her side, holding her other hand, and looking up to her. Tell, Hamilton, all that thou see'st. The hearing of it I can bear; but, O! the sight Would crush me. Ham. They join. Mary. O God! O God! Adel. O Mere de Dieu! [A pause of silence, Hamilton looking eagerly to the Field of Battle. Ham. O what a glorious sight! Look at these columns of the horse—through—through— Like warping meteors 'thwart the northern sky. The victory is on your Highness' side: The Douglas' banner pierces through the line. Adel. But in whose hands? Perhaps 'tis taken, and its bearer slain. Ham. This day will prove that Fortune can befriend The cause of Justice:—Look, they break, they fly! Mary. Can it indeed be true that Fortune smiles On Mary Stewart? Again shall I behold My child after this dreary gloom of absence? Ah me! he will not know me; my son will start As if he saw a stranger in his mother: But I will smile so fondly on my babe, I'll press him to my breast, with an embrace That only mothers give, and infants know, Then through his tears he'll answer smile for smile. Ham. How well the rebels run, though 'gainst the hill: But yet they stop—again they stand: I fear It was a feint:—Gods!—now your Highness' men Give way; they waver—break. Mary. Stay, stay; for God's sake leave us not. Adel. O Douglas! Douglas! Mary. Perhaps—perhaps our leaders, in their turn, Are feigning a retreat. Ham. Alas, it is too rapid and confused! Horses, without their riders, flying here And there, and standards thrown away:— There is no hope. Mary. Is there no hope? Perhaps they wish to gain Their former ground. Ham. No, no,—your Grace must mount—the day is lost: Driven down the hill, some of your men Are forced into the river. Mary. O God, thy will be done! but save, O save My people! Adel. I must—will to the field. Ham. You both must flee. Mary. Ah! whither flee? Scotland is England now. Ham. For Nithisdale—speed to horse! to horse! I will compel you to your safety. [Exit, leading the Queen and Adelaide. END OF ACT SECOND. ACT III. SCENE I. —Lincluden Abbey in ruins. Enter Bernard, a Friar, carrying a Light before the Queen and Adelaide. Bern. This way, good people;—you've had a dismal night;— The rivers too are out. [Mary falls down almost lifeless, then recovers. Lady, you've nought to fear. Mary. I've nought to fear, that is too true: I'm sunk—I'm sunk—I'm at the very bottom Of ruin's gulf; so deep, that all around Reigns stillness horrible; while, far o'er head, The thunder of the storm is here scarce heard. Bern. O I have heard a tongue that spoke like yours, And seen an eye that wore that very look! Adel. May be;—but who is it that welcomes us? Bern. A man who has outlived all he held dear. Mary. Thou'lt not betray us? Adel. But tell,—it does import us much to know, In these dark times,—what party thou art of. Mary. Oh, I am very wretched! I am stunned With misery! But tell us, good old man, What place is this, and who thou art? Bern. I will remove your fears. Here have I dwelt Near threescore years. This place you must have heard of: Lincluden is its name. Within these walls Twelve beadsmen, of which number I was one, Said prayers by day, and nightly vigils kept. I am the only one that now remains In this sad corner of our ruined towers. Adel. How art thou suffered to remain? Bern. The bigot fury that destroyed our house Spared me. I had acquired, while in my youth I followed arms, some skill in healing wounds. Full many sorely hurt at Solway moss— Mary. O God! Bern. Were hither brought, and healed. Among the rest, One man, who afterwards, when the fierce rabble Circled these walls, with threats of instant death To all within, his left hand lifted up, And swore, that not a hair of Bernard's head He'd suffer to be touched: They gave assent. Thus was I saved; and here am I allowed To linger out my days. Mary. O, Solway, many an orphan didst thou make! But for that day I might have still a father. He was not healed—his wound was in his heart. Adel. I see that banner yet among the spears; He would not part with it, but with his life. O Douglas! Mary. He took me in his arms before he breathed His last, and kissed my then scarce conscious lip, And weeping, o'er me smiling, called me Mary, Ere at the font I had received that name: Hence 'twas a saying, that I was baptised With tears; and they who saw the scene presaged Ill fortune to me, and presaged too true. Bern. My Queen! my royal mistress! I said that I had seen that eye, and yet It is not so—but O how like the King's! My God, preserve her! bless her! O save her! [Kneeling. How can this be? (rising) your Highness in this guise? Mary. Ask not, good father, now; I scarce can speak; Were't possible, I'd go to rest. Bern. Besides this chamber, once our refectory, And my poor cell, there is a room of state, Which, in the days of our prosperity, Was set apart for guests of high degree: It too was left untouched. Mary. O lead me to it!—yet I cannot rest Until I know that Hamilton is safe. Enter an old Shepherd. Bern. Are the horses cared for? Shep. They are, father. Bern. An' please your Grace to follow me. [Exeunt Queen, Adelaide, and Bernard. Shep. What can this mean? Enter Hamilton. Ham. Say who art thou, and what this place? Shep. Say who art thou? Ham. Are there two strangers here? Shep. Old father Bernard—he will answer you. Ham. Who art thou, again I say? Shep. I'm an old shepherd man; all night I've watched Upon the hill with some few sheep, and now That day-light's near, and the storm fallen, I'm come to warm myself at Bernard's faggots. His door is never barred; his nightly taper Through the thick wintry flakes oft shoots a ray To guide us shepherds through the heaping drift. This night has been a kind of winter one. Now tell me who thou art? Enter Bernard. Bern. God save you, sir! Ham. Father, I thank you. Are there two strangers here? Bern. This is a roof which at all times, By day and night, welcomes the stranger's steps. Ham. I am the friend of those I now enquire for. Say, came they here?—They are—but why describe them— They are most fair,—unfortunate as fair. Bern. Your name? Ham. Hamilton. Bern. The Queen is here; and with her came One of a downcast, and tear-hidden eye; But such a soft and soothing voice she had, That when she spake, I thought some seraph hymned A requiem for an infant's parted soul. Ham. 'Tis she—'tis Adelaide. Bern. They're gone to rest. How came you not along with them? Ham. We scarce had seen your tapers welcome ray, When something from among the trees came forth, And followed us. I bade the Queen proceed: I turned—it fled: I followed it too far: O'erta'en at last, it turned—it seemed a man, But gave a groan unlike aught earthly; and then I heard the gnash of teeth. My charger wheeled, And brought me, ere I wist, close to the river, Where, frightened at the rapid eddying foam, He stopped, nor, till the rowels reached his ribs, Would take the flood. What could it be? Bern. None in these parts know who he is: We think his hands have been embrued in blood. In winter's bitterest storms he sometimes sits Beneath the gateway's broken arch; and there I've overheard half-muttered sentences, Such as—'twas me—no, 'twas this hand—not me: Had it been day—had I but seen her face, The deed had ne'er been done:— And then he'll fix his eyes upon the ground, As if he looked on something lying there, Then, seeming horror-struck, rush to the woods. Re-enter Queen and Adelaide. Mary. Lord Hamilton, I joy to see you safe, but yet must blame you. Ham. I left you, as the best means to defend you. Mary. 'Twas for the best, I know. Bern. How short has been your Highness' rest! Mary. I've had no rest: I fell into a sleep, And in that sleep have had such horrid visions!— A fiend pursued me o'er a sandy waste; I heard his steps gain on me; then his shadow Lengthened before me; then his furnace breath I felt shrivelling my hair: Lifeless I sunk. And next I found myself among the woods We passed yestreen; boisterous and dark the night, Save for the lightning's glare, which flamed so bright, That oft the traces of its zigzag course Were visible among the half-burnt leaves, Still curling from the flash. A raven next, Beneath a blasted yew, was busy gorging A murdered infant's corse. A friendly peal At this dire moment waked me. Adel. And I, I too, saw horrid sights: I saw— Half raised upon his arm, he fainting held That banner to his breast, to staunch the blood. Bern. Banish the memory of these phantasies! Put trust in God! Be of good cheer! Mary. You never dreaded sleep. Bern. God yet may turn The hearts of your worst enemies to love you. Meanwhile, you here may sojourn quite unknown; Nor shall you want for aught: I've friends all round. Mary. If e'er the hearts of my worst foes should turn To love and to obey their Queen, be sure That you shall have another resting-place Than this so drear abode. Ingratitude My enemies could ne'er reproach me with. Bern. I'll thank your Highness' with my heart's last throb; But know, I would not leave this lonely place: Those I hold dear;—one I held dear is laid Within that roofless chapel wall: Each weed That grows about her grave I know; They spring With gaudless flowers, year after year the same: The wind that sighs among you aged trees Sounds like an old friend's voice: Even Cluden's stream, Whether 'neath summer suns it gently flows, With such a whispering murmur, that the bee Upon the farther bank is heard to hum; Or whether, in its ice-fraught course, it roar So loud amid the wintry thunder storm, That though the flash is seen, the peal's unheard,— All, all its sounds are grateful to mine ear: I would not part from it, or from these woods, The very birds of which are tame, and know me: I should even miss the echo's wonted voice, That gives responses to my lonely hymn, And bears it, with a music not its own, To heaven. But hark, the woodland matins rise. Adel. O happy birds, each minstrel's mate is near! Bern. And shall our hearts be cold, and tongues be mute? An please your Highness, it is still my wont, Within the roofless chancel, to perform The service which in former days I joined. No person and no season hinders me: The snowy shower that drives upon my head, It shuts my eyes, but cannot seal my lips, When singing praise to God: The drifted wreath Feels like a downy cushion 'neath my knees. Come to the chancel, friends; come, follow me. Mary and Adel. Most joyfully. Ham. I may not go where Romish rites are done. Shep. I dare not go. [Exeunt Queen, Adelaide, and Bernard. Ham. That good old man, his words, his aspect mild, Almost persuade me to renounce my faith. Shep. Aye, he is good; his thoughts are ne'er on earth, Save when he's doing good among the poor: At other times his thoughts are all in heaven. Even in the night, we often hear his voice Borne faintly on the wind. His taper burning, Aye, and before an image on the cross, (That's wrong?) he never suffers to go out. Ham. List! list!— [Music of Voices heard—“By the Rivers of Babylon,” &amp;c.—Voice stops. How faint the echo floats along the aisles, As 'twere the soul of the departed strain! That hymn will to the mercy-seat ascend, And there, in unison with heavenly harps, Will from their chords (while listening angels pause) Draw forth a sound more sweet than seraph's touch. O what are forms, but different languages Addressed to Him, who knows all tongues, who hears The heart! We'll go to them. Shep. I will attend you to the gate, but not Go in. [Exeunt? SCENE II. —The Chapel. Bernard, Mary, and Adelaide. Mary. That hymn hath soothed my spirit: I think I now Could rest in quiet. Sleep, now I dread thee not! My dreams no longer will be horror-haunted; Angelic strains will lull my ear; my couch Shall be all curtained round with cherubs wings, Through which the morning sun will faintly send A purple slumber-shedding ray, sealing My weary eyelids for a time with peace, Until some gentle well-known voice Breathe in my ear, awake: And yet I think I see—no, no—begone—false fear— I gave no warrant—I forbade the deed. Adel. I hear a tread.— [Looking round. Ah me! it is not his. [Exeunt Mary and Adelaide. Bern. The shaft is plucked, but O I fear the barb Is rankling in her heart: If it be so, O God, forgive! Enter Hamilton. Ham. Where is the Queen? Bern. They are just gone. The Queen thought she could rest. Her spirit seemed—but for a moment—soothed. What think you 'tis that weighs upon her mind? Ham. What think you—to have been a Queen, and now To be cast down below a subject's state. Bern. I long to learn from you, my lord, the events Which must have come to pass since that the Queen Was held a captive in Lochleven isle. Ham. Father, you shall be satisfied. Bern. Let us, meantime, return: I must set down Refreshments 'gainst the awaking of the Queen. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A Wood on the Banks of Cluden. Enter Adelaide. Adel. Aye, she may sleep, whose loss is but a kingdom. She may be yet restored—The dead to life Return not.—Aye, sleep on, poor Queen, be happy A little while. She smiled, but soon a tear Her close-shut eyelash filled; and then again She smiled, but 'twas more faintly than before. I ne'er shall smile again, even in a dream. O Douglas! Douglas! hadst thou not been slain, Thou wouldst ere now have been with us. Thou'rt dead—I thought I could discern In Hamilton's close visage signs of joy; He knows, perhaps, thou'rt numbered with the dead; And yet, how should he? But Douglas, know, thy spirit ne'er shall see My love for thee to Hamilton transferred; No, if thou'rt dead, I'll even break the bonds Of sacred friendship; I'll forsake the Queen, Fly to thy grave, and make thy turf my couch. Why did I seem to favour him I loved not, Lord Hamilton, from whom my heart was far? Why did not Douglas see 'twas him I loved? The thought of it had been a comfort to him, When on the corse-strewed field he took His last look of the hill on which he left me. Oh me! had he but known how well I loved him, He would have been more careful of his life. O I have murdered him! He rushed on Death, Driven by Despair. Hadst thou but known how open was my ear To listen to the faintest prayer of love Urged by thy lips; how open were these arms To clasp thee to this breast; how my heart leaped With ardent hope one day to feel thine beat With mutual throb!—May be he yet does live. O, if he lives, feigning henceforth begone. Perhaps he feigns, and I am but the step— What if he loves the Queen— And sometimes I have thought her Highness' voice Was softer toned to him than other men. Enter Douglas, and kneels. Doug. Feign! no! Adel. God!—. [Falling, Douglas supports her. Douglas! no! Douglas thou art not: None of that name was ever treacherous found; No Douglas ever would have lain in wait To hear the ravings of a simple maid. Doug. Hear me, fair Adelaide! dear lady, hear me! I did not lie in wait with the design To hear your words. When I had hither come, I knew not who inhabited this place, Or friend or foe; wherefore I thought it best To take the advantage of the woodland shelter, Until I learned whether it would be safe To come more near. Just then I heard a voice, Of which, although I oft had heard the tones, Its music was so new to me, I thought it could not be but that I dreamed, Till by degrees I waked indeed to bliss. Adel. But Douglas, Douglas, say you heard me not; The Cluden's rushing roar was all so loud, You could not hear. Doug. Some words indeed I lost: But did you not my name reiterate In such a voice as told you loved the sound? Did you not say—Do not I see that blush? Adel. I'll hide it, Douglas, in thy arms. But you are wounded? Doug. No, I escaped unhurt, To be (how little did I think) most blest. Adel. And how did you escape—O Douglas, how? Doug. While thus you speak—I cannot think of what— Of what is past; the present Engrosses my whole soul. Adel. I love to hear. Doug. And do you truly wish to hear? Adel. I love to hear you speak about yourself. Doug. You saw the fight, and our discomfiture: A ponderous mace soon brought me to the ground. Adel. Douglas, is this thy hand? Do I not dream? Art thou indeed beside me? Doug. And when I from my stupor first awoke, I saw around me dead and dying men. The rout was o'er: The crowds, that on the hills Had stood, were now upon the field, to search For kinsmen or for friends. 'Twas a sad sight. The grey-haired father helped to bear the son Uncoffined to the grave, then laid the turf, With purple-bosomed gowans blood-bedewed, Above the mangled corpse. Amid this scene, Some of the horsemen, tired from the pursuit, Alighted, and were plied with flaggons, brought By Glasgow's zealous burghers to the field. My guards, (for I was 'mong the prisoners,) One after other, fell asleep. One wretch I never shall forget, whose ruffian head Was bolstered on a dead man's gory breast. I watched my time, rose, seized a straying horse: None of my guards could mount to follow me. Thus soon I was beyond the jangling sound Of old St Kentigern's rejoicing peal. Adel. How did you trace us? Doug. The country was all out; the mountain cairns Were clustered o'er; and at the cottage doors The old men stood, and asked, with trembling voice, How went the day.—Your course was not unmarked. From place to place I questioned of your way: At last I reached a cottage by a stream, Where you had left the little glib-tongued page. He pointed out a hill o'er which you passed: I passed it too; descended to the vale;— A dreadful night ensued; it stopped me not. Although I judged that I had lost you quite, I wandered on, half frantic with despair, And cursed the flash that showed my horse the flood Or wished-for precipice. But wherefore speak Of dangers past? I am now here with you. O happiness unhoped! No thought but joy Can now pervade my breast. Come, speak to me. Adel. I am so happy, I can only hear. Doug. And I can only think of what I heard. You said, I think, my turf should be your couch. Adel. Peace now, sweet Douglas, peace! Doug. And that— Adel. So soon to taunt at my too quick won love! Doug. And that your beating heart— Adel. You'll kill me. Doug. I love to raise your blush, to feel its glow Spread o'er my raptured cheek. Adel. But two days gone you were a humble lover; You trembled when you did but touch my glove. But, Douglas, did you never guess 'twas you I loved? Doug. But once, and only once, I dared to hope: 'Twas when you asked Argyle, before the fight, That he would leave me with the Queen and you: Your look, your voice, expressed solicitude Less for yourself than me: Then first I hoped. O it was sweet, though faint as the first breath Of some lone spring-flower, first of all its tribe, Which one would stoop to smell, yet think 'twere sin To pull. Adel. How are you sure that I do love you? Doug. Think you I have forgot— My turf should be your couch? No, Adelaide, Your head shall rest, your eyes shall gently close Upon this arm. Adel. Be sober-minded, as becomes our fortunes. Doug. Sobriety, demureness, melancholy, I do henceforth renounce, abjure you all. But tell me now, how wouldst thou have found out Thy truelove's grave among the other heaps? Adel. Why, by this mark—No flower, save only one, Called love lies bleeding, would have dared to grow— But, O! 'tis barbarous in me to harbour One cheerful thought, when Mary, Queen of Scots, My friend, my dearest, earliest, bosom friend, Lurks here a fugitive. Doug. My Adelaide, or mourning or rejoicing, If 'tis with thee, 'tis sweet: I sympathise With all thy sympathies: Besides, I love The Queen, and I will serve her for thy sake, And for her own. Is she within yon walls? Adel. She's there—she's gone to rest. Doug. What does she mean to do? where mean to go? Adel. To England straight. Doug. To England! Does she not know Elizabeth? Adel. I have in vain to endeavoured to dissuade her. Doug. And will you follow her, and pine your days, Sunk in the dungeon of an English prison? Adel. Perhaps they'll feel compassion for a Queen, A banished, helpless woman. Doug. No, no; fear, hatred, envy, all have steeled The heart of England's Queen. Adel. Mary feels no mistrust. Doug. And will you follow her? Adel. I am resolved—she's bent to go. Doug. Because she vaults a precipice, are you By any tie obliged to follow her? You follow ruin; her you cannot save. Adel. I cannot save—but I can die with her. But we must hence; she is, I fear, awake ere now. Doug. Lean on my arm—How very light you lean; I fear you love me not. Adel. Love you not! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. —The Refectory. Mary seated. Hamilton and Bernard waiting on each side. Mary. She cannot sure be far; she would not leave me Bern. No; for I have seen her look upon your Grace with such a look as spoke—whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried. She comes, but not alone. Enter Adelaide, followed by Douglas. Mary. Douglas! Doug. I joy to see your Grace in safety. Mary. Rise, Douglas, 'tis not fit you kneel to me; I am no more a Queen. Doug. If to yourself, and to your country's cause, You are not treacherous, you are still a Queen. Mary. What tidings do you bring? Doug. We lost the day, that's sure; but if your Highness Had staid, our flight might but have been retreat. You yet have many friends. Mary. I fear to ask How many fewer than before the battle. Doug. Cassilis I saw amongst the prisoners. No one of any note, that I could hear of, Was of the slain. Mary. Woes me!—of any note! How many men, Whose names were never heard beyond the sound Of their own native village bells, are mourned With tears more bitter than are shed for men Of high degree!—the poor man's orphan child Weeps as he sees the smooth-worn ploughshafts lie; He thinks upon the hard but kindly hand That helped his infant steps. Doug. Your Grace is not to blame; do not repine For what could not be helped. If to yourself You'r true, all yet may be retrieved; your friends Are numerous, powerful, faithful, though dispersed. Mary. How of them all art thou alone with me? How didst thou 'scape—how trace us out— How was the battle lost? Tell me each circumstance. Doug. 'Twas lost—but how, it boots not to inquire. Mary. Tell me, for I can bear to hear. Doug. I'll tell your Highness all I saw. Montgomery, with a band of noted names, A chosen few, moved wedgewise onward, No more regardful of the English archery, Than it had been a flight of thistle-downs; But, at two spear-lengths from the meeting phalanx, Forward— They cleft it thorough, like a thunder-bolt Ploughing a chasm 'thwart the foam-capt waves.— Here, with an edgeless stroke, I was laid low. How long I lay, I'm ignorant; but when I lift my eyes—no banner to be seen— 'Twas gone—'twas lost by me—the Bruce's heart. Soon as I stirred, a soldier, who had thought me dead, Wrenched from my clotted hand, the gore-glued hilt, By this time Glasgow's citizens Were plying hard their friends with merry pints, Staggering o'er corpses both of friend and foe: My maudlin guards, o'ercome with wine and sleep, I left; one of their horses straight I mounted, And soon I was beyond the dismal sound Of old St Mungo's dong, which, whether meant For funeral knells for their departed friends, Or merry peals for dear-bought victory, I do not know; but this I know, that all I met, questioned me how the day had gone, In words that told me that they wished you well. I even met some bands hasting to join; And, when I told them that they came too late, They looked as if they thought, “had we been there, “It might not have gone thus.”—Your Highness' friends Are many thousands strong. Go not to England. Mary. How did you trace us out? Doug. I knew your thoughts had often turned to England As a last refuge. I southward bent my course To Loudon Hill, and stopped by happy chance At the small cot-house, by the little stream, Where you had left your tiny magpie page. Mary. Poor child!—O tell me, were they kind to him? He too's an orphan, left in strangers' hands. Doug. The dame had sent him out to keep some sheep; But, when I went in search of him, I found The pretty elf asleep upon the bank: I stood, and wished my slumbers were as sweet: So gentle was his sleep, his breath scarce moved A primrose flower that almost kissed his lip; A rushy crown, half finished, lay beside him; The flock was scattered here and there around. Mary. O Scotland! O my people! Doug. When I had waked him, he was at first all joy: But, when I asked him to point out the way That you had ta'en, he could not answer me; With tear-filled eye he looked, and pointed southward; O'er yon far hill (at last he said) they passed; I saw them 'tween me and the light as small As little birds.—He would not let me go; It wrung my heart to force his little hand From mine. I promised to return—Then, forward. By the last streak of light, from Cossencot I saw the vale of Nith, and did resolve To keep its course. What is your Highness now determined on? Mary. England—England is now my only refuge: And yet I doubt. She tried to intercept My voyage to my native shore. I fear. Adel. The Queen of England will protect her sister. Doug. [To Adel.] Poor simple bird! Perhaps she will allow thee To flutter in a gilded cage; but still Thou'lt find thyself a prisoner. Mary. I ask not Adelaide to follow me. Adel. But I will follow you, though you forbid; I think I am in safety while with you. Mary. Thou seek'st the perilous shelter of a tree, To shun a thunder-storm. Doug. If e'er you trust yourself on English ground, I'm sure I ever shall have cause to rue That I released you from a Scottish prison. 'Twill be a sorry change. Woe is the fate Of him that bears the double wretchedness Of exile and captivity. Mary. Captivity! Doug. Yes, imprisonment. Mary. What do you mean? Doug. 'Twill be a prologue. Mary. To what? Doug. To a tragedy. Mary. Speak in plain words. Doug. She'll treat you as her prisoner at first; And oft you've read, the distance is but small Between a prince's prison and his grave. Mary. You give advice in aught but courtly style. Your words have shocked me, Douglas; you should have Some pity on me 'mid this storm of fate: Your words are lightning gleams, which, while they shew The foam-capt rock where ruin's breakers dash, Scathe and dismantle the poor labouring bark, And make her quite a helpless piece of wreck. Doug. Alas, no words I speak can serve to shew The Queen of England; she is a sunken rock Beneath a smooth and halcyon seeming bay. Mary. She would not crown herself with infamy. Doug. A woman and a queen can never want Pretexts. She'll at her manifesto mint, Stamp the base bullion with the regal die Of state necessity. Mary. Do not belie the Queen. Ham. I would not trust to her; She envies, hates, and fears your Majesty. I marked how once,—as Cecil spoke your praise, She blanched; her eye, retreating 'neath her brow, Seemed like an arrow peering through a loop-hole, Drawn back before it flies: Then such a rush Of blood o'erspread her face, as quite outflamed Her Berenician locks. Bern. O, put no trust in such a woman! Adel. Trust your own countrymen; they love you. Mary. Wilt thou not go with me? Adel. Can you believe I would not go with you? To think you were a prisoner, and I free, 'Twould kill me.—I ne'er will leave you—no; Were this Elizabeth some monster serpent, Hurrying to wreathe its undulating length Around my friend, I'd rush to her embrace, And joy to die in the same venomed folds. Enter Shepherd. Shep. I see three horsemen up the river side. Mary. How near? Come they this way? Look they like friends or foes? Shep. They were so distant, and they glittered so, I could not guess who they might be. Mary. How far? Shep. 'Yond Halbert's bughts. Bern. That's half a mile or more, an' please your Grace. I doubt not that they are your friends; But, please your Highness, go into my cell Until we know the certainty. Mary. I am resolved; I will not thus remain A slave to ever new alarms: I'll brave The storm, rather than, crouching, tremble thus Beneath the shelter of a threatening rock. For England at sunset we depart; 'tis fixed: My resolution's taken; do not harass me With vain entreaty. Meantime, good Bernard, We'll to thy cell; the Queen of Scots must learn To stoop her uncrowned head. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THIRD. ACT IV. SCENE I. —Windsor. Enter Elizabeth and Cecil. Cecil. The snare has answered to our wish. I guessed that any sudden change of fortune Would make her turn her thoughts to England. I had prepared accordingly for her reception. Eliz. Is't Lancaster, said you? Is it a place of strength? Cecil. Of strength to laugh at rescue. Eliz. I fear we shall be blamed for these harsh measures. Cecil. Be blamed for execution of the laws! Eliz. She's not in chains?—that sure would be too cruel. Cecil. Perhaps it would. Eliz. Yet, to prevent escape— Cecil. She's in sure ward. Eliz. What if we should comply with her request, And let her visit us? 'Twould be a triumph To see a captive Queen in England's court. Cecil. That must not be; she'd turn your nobles' hearts. O, I have seen her, ere I sowed dispeace Between her and her people: Every eye Was bent on her, with looks of love. She seemed A beauteous star shot from its sphere, that drew The constellations in its train: That is To say,—she seemed—she looked— Eliz. And shall I lose by the comparison? [Angrily. Cecil. An' please your Majesty to pardon me. Lose! No; though Venus' self were to descend, She'd first feel envy when she looked at you. Eliz. You do not think so.—Is Wingfield come? Cecil. He is at hand. Eliz. Send him to me. [Exit Cecil. [Reading a Letter.] “To be banished from my “country, and from my son—to be received in a prison, “and welcomed with fetters—Permit me either to “see your Majesty, or to return to my country and “my son—Languish unpitied and unseen.”— Unseen! She thinks, that if she were but seen, She would be pitied, aye, and loved besides; She'd draw the constellations in her train.— Her son! She boasts, too, of her son!—Detested— The threatened chains shall be realities. Aye, she shall feel their weight; and change Her posture, and still feel the iron's weight Bruising her beauteous arms, till the livid blotches Turn into festering sores, which flies shall loath To light upon. I'll goad her on to crimes; Then she shall have no reason to complain Of languishing unpitied and unseen. Her night of woe I will at last illume With lurid gleams of gorgeous misery, Displaying in the collied verge a scaffold.— Some have, for love, dipped napkins in the blood Of sufferers at the block: I, I, for hate, Could steep my pillow in the reeking stream, And lay my head in dreams of sweetest vengeance.— But, no—a public death!—'twould draw forth pity. I'd have her die unpitied and unseen.— He comes.—How to begin—I feel I dare not, Even to him. A villain though he be, He is a human being, and his eye Will look me dumb—But, no; I'm Henry's daughter. Enter Wingfield. Wing. An please your Majesty— Eliz. Wingfield! Wing. I'm here, an please your Majesty. Eliz. What sort of day is it? It seems, I think, to overcast. Wing. 'Tis a fine sunshine day, an please your Grace; And yet 'tis somewhat cloudy, I believe. Eliz. What are the people saying? Wing. Of what, an please your— Eliz. Of any thing—of every thing—the North. Wing. They think that things go well in Scotland. Eliz. I had a thing to say, but talking of these matters Has drove it from me: What, what could it be? Wing. Was it about the restiff commoners? Eliz. No, not that. Wing. The Queen of Scots? Eliz. No, no.— Wingfield, go shake the arras there; There, just behind where Brutus lifts his arm. I am not safe; I have no peace; I dread Some lurking king-killer; and still must live In dread, as long—till— Wing. Till when, an please your Majesty? Eliz. Until— Wing. I'll die, to save your royal life. Eliz. Would'st thou, now, put a poniard in thy breast, To save my life? Wing. I would. Eliz. Would'st thou become a suicide? commit Self-murder? Wing. I would. Eliz. 'Tis the most heinous of all sorts of murder. Wing. 'Twere here a pious deed. Eliz. If, then, to save my life, thou'dst sacrifice Thy own, and do self-murder; say, would'st thou not Think it less sinful to bereave of life Another, to attain the end? One guilty too; and one who, if not struck, Will strike? Wing. That were most sure a meritorious deed. Eliz. But who's the judge? who has the right to judge? Wing. The truth: The truth's the truth, though not declared By gospel-kissing knaves, who often yield Their perjured judgments to a scarlet robe. Eliz. O now I recollect what 'twas I thought of; The banished Queen of Scots—her maintenance— 'Tis hard the people should be burdened. Wing. 'Tis very hard. Eliz. And that the prince's state should be endangered. Wing. It is not right. Eliz. And yet, nor prince nor people have a friend To rid them of those burdens, and those hazards. Wing. Your Grace has many friends. Eliz. Aye, faithful friends, who'd rather serve themselves, Than do disservice to mine enemies. Wing. Who are your Grace's enemies? Eliz. Have I not named the Queen of Scots? Wing. She is your prisoner; she's in your hands. Eliz. She lives, and she has friends. Wing. Your Grace cannot complain of want of friends. Eliz. My friends have tongues. Wing. And some of them have hands. Eliz. And yet my enemies live. Wing. What would your Highness that your friends should do? Is death your life? Eliz. Begone! dost think I am a murderess? Wing. No, justice is no murder. Eliz. I fear the bird, though limed, may yet escape. Where then would be my safety?— Say, would'st thou, Wingfield, choose to be its keeper? The rangership of Wiersdale should be thy fee.— But, hark— Wing. An' please your Grace. Eliz. I would not have her blood upon my head; There is no need, no, none for shedding blood. Blood, though it sometimes glides with silent flow, At other times speaks with a cataract's roar. Wing. What does your Highness mean? Eliz. Mean! You ought to take with you a skilful cook; She's fond of dainty fare. Wing. I've been informed, she has a female friend Who tastes each thing she eats or drinks. Eliz. The holy wafer. Wing. How? Eliz. None tastes of it before she eats. Wing. I am no priest. Eliz. Wise, prudent priests there are, and of her faith. In Lancashire they swarm. Wing. The rangership? Eliz. I've said it:—But, hear, I would not have this done, unless you find That those suspicions which I have surmised Have truth for their foundation. Examine well; I put thee in the place of those same knaves, Those gospel-kissing knaves, of whom thou spok'st. Enquire, and judge; and let thy verdict be Written in deeds, not words; but, recollect, It must be on full proof. I would not touch The life o'the innocent to save my own. Wing. I would not do it, though your Highness ordered. Eliz. Wingfield! Wing. What more, an' please your Grace? Eliz. Nothing—O aye, I think on't; do not be Another Hubert; but yet, remember well, It must be on full proof of guilt: Remember! [Exit. Wing. Conscience, shall I be schooled by thee! Thou shadow of the soul, at which fools start. Crime! what is crime? If there be such a thing, It lies in the intention, and in that My guilt is now complete;—the plan is here: [Pointing to his brow. It is a furled scene, that's soon unrolled, A tragic scene, by Treachery drawn in blood. But where is all this guilt? What can I add To misery like hers?— Imprisonment perpetual is her doom: Death is the sole deliverance she can hope. Death—death—aye, death must come one day to me; What then? what is it but a loss of being? And what annihilation, but a sleep, Unhaunted by those qualmish phantasies, Which, while awake, I laugh at? [Exit. SCENE II. —Lancaster Castle. (Time—Evening.) Mary and Adelaide on the Battlements of one of the Towers. Mary. The fourteenth day is past, and yet no answer. O that I ne'er had crossed the Solway sea! Adel. Mary, be comforted. If there be laws of hospitality, Pity in woman, kindness in a sister, Or loyalty in princes, you are safe. Mary. And yet we're prisoners. Adel. Aye, we again are prisoners, 'tis too true; And who will rescue us a second time? Mary. O England, England! grave of murdered princes! Why did I leave thee, Scotland, dearest land? In thee I had some friends—they died for me. O were I on the side of yon dim mountain! Though wild and bleak it be, it is in Scotland. Adel. Alas! 'tis but a cloud. Mary. No, 'tis a mountain of sweet Annerdale. Adel. Ah, no! 'tis but a cloud; you know our distance. Mary. Well, then, it is a cloud that hovers o'er My dear, my native land: I love that cloud, That misty robe of spirits. O, Adelaide, Come soothe me with that mournful song— 'Tis an old thing; we heard it in the days Of happiness, and yet it filled our eyes With tears; we heard it in the vale of Morven: 'Twas something—'twas about the voice of Cona. Adel. The maiden with the distaff by the stream, 'Twas she that sung it: I do remember; and, after she had sung it, She tried to tell it o'er in broken Scottish. Mary. Let me hear it. Adel. I feel my heart so full, that but one note, A single note, sung even by myself, Would quite untune my voice.—Shall we descend? Mary. Whither? Adel. To our chamber. Mary. The weary rook hies home—my home's a prison. All things are free but me. Why did I leave Lochleven's beauteous isle? There I could range Along the shore, or, seated on the bank, Hope still for better days; there could transform The clouds reflected in the clear blue lake To sceptres and to diadems restored; And, when the visions melted into air, I drew a kind of quaint and foolish comfort, To see how far the watery circles spread In sympathetic motion with my tears.— O it presages ill the more I think! Their forcing Douglas back—he rescued us; And if it were not meant that we should still Continue prisoners, why should the last, The last friend but thyself, The sole attendant of a Queen, Be banished from her, and so rudely too? Adel. Perhaps, for ever! No, I will not suffer My foolish fears to think 'twill be for ever: No, no, we yet shall meet—we shall be free.— Mary, be comforted; you see I still, I think I still could—smile. Mary. Thou'rt not a banished Queen, a captive Queen; Thou'rt not a mother severed from her infant. I do remember when I used to think, How it was misery, most anxious misery, To be beyond the hearing of his voice: Even when I watched beside him as he slept In softest sleep, I've thought he ceased to breathe; Then, trembling, would I lift the silken cover, And at the light he'd smile without awaking. What extacy! But now he's watched by strangers, Perhaps by wretches hired to take his life.— O, God forgive me! Adelaide, That is a dreadful, dizzy height—'tis terrible! And yet to think, that in the little time In which I breathe a single heart-sick sigh, I end all sighs. Enter Warder. Ward. Your Grace will please come down; We're just about to lock. Mary. O let us breathe a little longer here. Adel. An' please you do; I know you're very good. Ward. The sun is set this hour; the dew falls thick; You'll mar that soft sweet voice if you bide out. Mary. Ah! misery is a shield against all seasons. Ward. 'Tis very late; the moon, you see, is up; I swear it's ten o'the clock, an't be an hour. Adel. Look at this dial here upon the corner, By it 'tis only six; I count by the moon. Ward. And why, fair lady? Adel. Because I'm one of Dian's virgin band. What think you of me?— But do, sweet keeper, let us stay a while. Ward. I wish Lord Scroop were here to give you leave; I scarcely dare to take so much upon me.— Well, well, you may: I'm sorry for you; I cannot tell you what I have to tell. Mary. What is it? Ward. Go not so near the wall, it is but low; Look how your shadow stretches cross the court. Mary. 'Would that I lay where now my shadow stretches! Adel. What have you got to tell? aught of our friends? Are any of them dead?—Speak, speak at once. Ward. No, that were nothing; but I am commanded— Mary. Well, I'm prepared to die. Ward. 'Tis not so bad, thank God, as that. Mary. What is it? Ward. Chains. Mary. Chains! Ward. I've orders that this night your Grace should wear A chain.—O, woe is me! All I can do, It shall be light, the lightest one we have, One which, they say, a little prince, Ta'en in the wars between the Roses, wore For many a weary night and day in this same castle. Mary. Oh! Adel. The order sure extends to me: I'll not be single, I will have one too, Although it were of links like anchor rings. These hands will ne'er submit to dastard freedom While Mary Stewart's wrists are bound with chains. Give me one too; I say, give me a chain.— But, keeper, must the Queen of Scots— Do not,—you need not do it. Mary. I'm ready; on, I'll follow thee. My fate is all before me; I see it all. Can malice, fraud, and cruelty like this Exist, and can the stupid world look up, Shouting, God save this model of all virtue! [Exeunt. SCENE III. —Wiersdale Forest. (Time—Night.) Gypsies sitting under a Tree. 1 Gypsy. I'll act the abbot. 2 Gypsy. You're not fat enough; I'll be the abbot myself. 3 Gypsy. And I'll be little John. 1 Gypsy. Thou little John! thou two-ell barber's pole. 3 Gypsy. And thou the abbot! thou whey-cheeked, small-beer nosed ninny. Enter Maude, a female Gypsy, singing. Maude. His nose is purple as a plum. 2 Gypsy. Aye, that's me; I am the abbot. [Sings. Her cheek is like the shilfa's breast, Her neck is like the swan's, Her— Enter Rosa, another female Gypsy, singing. Rosa. When the moon-beam shines so bright, That flower-bells open to her light, We fairies— Enter Douglas and Hamilton, with slung bows, coming forward from the back ground. Ham. Good folks, what is all this? Rosa. [Singing.] Dance right merrily. Doug. Sweet lass, what is't you sing? Rosa. I enact the Queen of the Fairies; I was singing the prologue. 1 Gypsy. And who are you, Sir? Doug. We live by our bows. 1 Gypsy. Then you'll probably die on a tree. Will you be one of us? You're from Scotland, I think? Ham. Right: But who are you? 1 Gypsy. Of a most honourable pedigree; none of our gang can boast an equal one: My brother was hanged for sheep-stealing, my mother was thrice i'the stocks, my father suffered with Johnie Armstrong; I was intended for the church, but I liked stealing better. Doug. But what was your contention about? I heard high words. 1 Gypsy. It was about the casting of the parts. Ham. What parts? 1 Gypsy. The Abbot of Unreason, Maid Marian, and the other parts of the play. Doug. Who acts the Queen of the Fairies? 1 Gypsy. Rosa here, my daughter; she does it passing well, though I say it. Sing us, child, the old prologue. 'Tis in the character, Sir, you must know, of the Queen of the Fairies. Quickly, child; quickly and trippingly. Rosa. [Sings.] When the moon shines all so bright, That flower-bells open to her light, Round about the hawthorn tree We fairies dance right merrily, Merrily, merrily. And when the fickle beam retires, What care we—our frolic quires Round the glow-worm's moving lustre Still in sportive revels muster, Merrily, merrily, Beneath the hawthorn tree. So light we tread, no flower we crush, Nor break the deep ear-soothing hush; You might, so noiseless is our tread, Hear gossamers o'er flowerets spread, All 'neath the hawthorn tree. Ere summer flies, in watery dell, Between two waves of gentle swell, We're tripping borne across the deep; But still our nightly sports we keep, So merrily, so merrily, On the smooth-rolling sea. Doug. 'Tis featly done. Ham. It goes right airily. 1 Gypsy. We're going, an' please you, to enact this play at Lancaster fair, before the castle; the Queen of Scots will see us. Doug. And are you sure she's there? we heard she was at Bolton. 1 Gypsy. I saw her but two days gone; she was looking through the grate of John o' Gaunt's tower; and when some of the— Enter an Old Gypsy. Old Gypsy. And when— 1 Gypsy. And when— Old Gypsy. I'm telling it.—And when the rabble reviled her, she kissed her hand, and held it through the bars; at which the giddy fools raised such a shout— 1 Gypsy. You'll know blind Robin the old Scotch minstrel; he has but one leg, and one tune; he lost his leg at Flodden Field: I led him that day the Queen was brought in, and her beauty was so bright, I sometimes thought old Robin saw her; for his face turned as she rode along, as if he had seen her; and in sooth, he said, he never saw her look sae bonny since the time she flang him a siller croun, and bade him no weary himsel' wi' playing. Doug. Was there any one with her? 1 Gypsy. There is a lady with her, but she ne'er shows herself. Ham. I'd give my land (if I had any) to see this Queen. 1 Gypsy. Your land, forsooth! But what hinders you to see her? You may go there to-morrow; we'll make you complete gypsies.—But, in the mean time, gentles, we must go on with our rehearsal; the rest of our company are waiting for us. Yon little plat is our stage; the white-branched hawthorn our scenes; the moon and stars our lustres; and you will be our audience. Haste, trip with me: Come, follow— Rosa. [Singing.] Follow, follow me. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. —The Terrace of the Castle Garden, Lancaster. (Time—Night.) Enter Wingfield and Francisco, conversing. Fran. I do not like the work. Wing. You shall have what you ask; I hold a broad commission. Think of the angels: Those I offer you, They're not your feathered tribe of cherubims, But solid sterling gold: Twelve score of them Are worth whole legions of the other kind. Fran. I care not for your gold; I'd rather have preferment in the church. Wing. That cannot be, unless you will abjure The errors of the Romish superstition. Fran. O God forefend I ever should do that! My conscience will not let me think of that. Wing. If you'll abjure, you shall be Dean of Peterborough; The place is vacant at this very time. Fran. My conscience is not pliable. Wing. There is small difference 'twixt the two religions. Fran. I'll think of it. Wing. Think of the deanery. Fran. I'll think of it. Wing. Will you not flinch? Fran. A Spaniard break his word! Wing. I'll go before: Meantime prepare the chapel. Fran. 'Tis requisite it be reconsecrated; I'd not profane the holy ordinance In an unhallowed place. Against to-morrow It may be ready. Wing. Do then prepare.— This is a strong, yet slowly sapping drug, [Delivering to him a little Box. A subtle, vital-gnawing thing, that's sure, Though imperceptible: The deed might else be traced. Death must not rudely pluck the pretty flower; No, let the canker-worm work at its root, So, by degrees, she'll fade, then droop, then fall: Nor will the real cause be once surmised. [Exit. Fran. The deanery of Peterborough!— For abjuration there is absolution. The deanery is a step: Why may not I, As well as others, reach the primacy? Then, having access to Elizabeth, Convert her from her present heresy, Rebuild the catholic church, and expiate My feigned defection from the holy see, And this projected pious-motived murder.— 'Twill do, 'twill do. [Exit. SCENE V. —Hall of the Castle. Enter Wingfield, followed by a Warder. Ward. 'Tis scarcely day. Wing. I must now see her; there is my warrant. Ward. You'd better wait an hour or two. Wing. No, not a second more; I do command— [Exit Warder. Now let me think how I may best ensnare This peerless piece of royalty. I must, If I obey my mistress's command, I must, By every hardship, goad her on to treasons, That, if the priest should fail, the judge may strike. But then she is so Christianly meek, She'll clothe herself in Resignation's stole:— I'll meet her there, I'll laugh her faith to scorn; That will, if any thing, incense her. Enter Mary and Adelaide. Mary. Who asks for me at this untimely hour? Wing. I bear the Queen's commission, which commands me To see your Grace the instant I arrived. Mary. Your business might have waited. Wing. Nay, 'tis your business most. I've orders to redress your wrongs: What are they? Mary. Am I at liberty? [Holding up her arms. Wing. No. Mary. Why am I not? Wing. The safety of the Queen requires this seeming harshness. Mary. Why are my friends forbid to visit me? Wing. It is the order of her Majesty. Mary. The word of God has said, Visit the prisoner; And who says no? a woman!— A curse will blast the power, that would arrest The prisoner's sigh floating to friendship's ear; That intercepts the beam of friendship's eye From lighting up the prison's dreary gloom: A curse will shrivel up the impious hand, That, with its sacrilegious signature, Arrests the joy-winged light, and tells The eye, which, with a grateful glance, Takes in the cope of heaven, to be content With the faint ray that, glimmering, struggles through The iron lattice of the hopeless man.— O God forgive me! May thy will be done. Wing. That is a pious wish. But who, or where Is God? If there be one, then thou art guilty; For why should innocence be doomed to suffer? Mary. And art thou sent to steal me from my faith? I rest on this: [Pressing a Psalter to her Breast. These are the words of life. Wing. Some foolish fables. Mary. This is the pillow of disease and age; On this the captive rests his weary head, And dreams of heaven. O blessed, blessed words! The bitterest tear that drops on you is sweet. These are the only words that comfort speak To broken hearts like mine. This little book The widowed mother presses to her breast, And gives it to her orphan child to kiss. The man bowed down by sorrow, who has laid The last of all his children in the grave, Returning to his lonely house, first finds Some solace here. Even to the death-doomed wretch, Who cannot read the blessed words of life, This volume makes his loaded arms feel light; Yea, even at the suffering hour, disarms The dreadful apparatus of its horrors. Perhaps to me that hour is in reserve,— When on a stage, with sable scenes hung round, Poor Mary Stewart shall lay down her life. Let that hour come! On this I lay my hand; Unclasping this, heaven opens to my view. Wing. Delusion all! Mary. I see, I see thee, proselyting fiend! The wretch who, tainted with the pestilence, Would breathe infection on the sleeping infant, Is not more devilish than is he who, 'reft Of hope himself, makes converts to despair. Wing. A God! [Smiling.]—What proof? That which you call his word, Is but the word of man. Mary. Canst thou blot out the stars? There do I read The Deity, there face to face behold him. Wing. Well, well, I did but jest; and, as a proof, I will o'erstep the bounds of my commission, And send a priest of your own faith To comfort you: Besides, I'll order that the castle-chapel Be given up to him, with liberty There to perform all rites of holy church. Mary. Heaven reward you! Adel. Amen. Wing. I'll on the instant go; 'tis now broad day; I'll rouse again the lazy Spaniard. [Exit. Adel. I do not like that man; His smile is still more hideous than his frown. Enter Warder. Ward. An please your Highness, there is come a fortune-teller; A cunning player on the harp besides. Say, would your Highness wish to see the man? Mary. I'm sure he cannot tell us any good; I wish not now to see him. Ward. Hark, he plays. [The “Flowers of the Forest” heard without. Mary and Adelaide appear astonished. Mary recovers herself. Mary. Yes, let him come; I think his touch is soft. [Exit Warden. It is the very hand of Douglas, and the tune He knows I took delight to hear him play. Adel. Ah, no! That tune, though Scottish, comes so near the heart, That 'tis a favourite with our enemies, And oftentimes draws tears from English eyes: There's many an English minstrel knows it well. Mary. But, hark!—the voice—'tis he. Adel. 'Tis Douglas! Mary. Be calm; there is some hidden purpose here: Study his looks, and if he seem to wish Not to be recognised, beware! Assume, Though fluttering be your heart to fly to him, Assume a cold indifference in your look. Adel. Can I look cold on Douglas?—and yet I will attempt. Enter Douglas, disguised in a Gypsy habit, followed by the Warder. Doug. God save your Grace! God bless thee, lady! Mary. Come forward, friend; why have you left your harp? Doug. I only play some few old things; the art Which I profess is one of higher dignity. Mary. And canst thou now, by looking at the lines Upon the hands, say when these shackled arms Shall once again be free? Doug. I think I can; but first I must inclose Your Highness, and your fair companion too, Within a certain circle of great virtue. Mary. I fear not such imprisonment as that. Doug. Well then, good warder, stand a little back While thus I draw my line;—a little farther— Aye, that will do. “Thrice times three athwart the line “I've warped through each heavenly sign, “Thrice times three, “Thrice times three, three, three, three.”— An' please your Highness now to reach your hand.— [Douglas, kneeling, surveys her hand. Aye, there's a lucky line.— This night, according as occasion offers, [Speaking low. Perhaps the next, or next again, Expect a trusty band, sworn to your rescue. Three days ago they'd leave Caerlavrock shore, In a stout bark, well trimmed and fitted out, Like those that sail to fish St George's sea. At dead of night they'll land, set fire at once To different places of the town, and— Mary. That must not be; how many sleeping infants— Doug. Be ruled by those who risk their lives to serve you.— Amid the noise, and hurry, and alarm, We win our way, by force or guile, to you, Bear off the prize, and straight embark for France. I pray you be prepared.— And you, sweet maid, come reach to me your palm: 'Tis a fair hand, that many gallants sue for. Come, let me see—I see, formed by these lines, A labyrinth from which thou'lt soon be free: The Queen of England is merciful as just.— Let me look nearer still. It is too soft; I fear it will too easily be won. But let me see again: These lines are branches of a full blown thorn, And that black mole, what is it but an ousel, Which 'mid the boughs so fair hath built its nest; A mystery right easy to be read: In brief, fair damsel, you do love a man, Who is so far from handsome, that his face Would scarcely be a foil to one like mine, [She seems for a moment displeased. Of Ethiopian tint: But, what is more, You'll win this sable gentleman; for if I know aught of my art or of myself, He loves you full as well as you love him. Adel. Now fair befal thee; tell me what's thy fee? Doug. Nor gold nor silver will I take of thine; One kiss of that sweet mouth is all I ask. Mary. Why hesitate to grant the spaeman's boon? Doug. A trick, a trick; that was thy cheek. Adel. Well, well, an that it must be so.— Ward. In sooth, a very gallant fortune-teller. Now, by Saint Peter's keys, I never saw, Since first I learned the trade of turning locks, One of thy tribe so bold, and yet withal So little given to greed. Adel. When wilt thou play again? Doug. Perhaps this night at sunset. Ward. Haste, friend, I must away; walk, trudge. Adel. At sunset. [Exeunt Douglas and Warder. Mary. I fear this too will fail.—Lead to my chamber, It is my home: Come, I would rest in it. I'm sick of disappointed hopes;—come, come. Adel. No, let us stay; none will disturb us here. That massive door is close; and here we see The furrowed field, from which spring all our hopes.— Look, yonder is a sail; and far beyond, As if suspended in the haze that joins The sea and sky, I think I can discern What seems another sail. Mary. I cannot see; my eyes ay fill with tears Whene'er I look upon the watery way, That brought me from the tranquil shores of France. But let me try; I'll look, though dim my sight.— Alas, thy hopes are bent to be deceived! That, nearest, is a gallant ship, deep-fraught, Whose well-stowed hull the shouldering waves Scarce heave; sail bulging above sail, she seems An airy castle turreted with clouds. Our friends! they voyage in some sooty buss, Hung round with lines, and nets, and pitchy ropes, And such like implements of fishers' gear. Adel. Well, well, they'll come; no matter in what plight. Look, see yon beauteous rainbow; you will grant, It is a happy omen. Mary. No, 'tis a broken vault; and, see, it fades, The fragments melting on the distant hills; And now 'tis gone, quite gone—so fade my hopes. Adel. I see you are determined to despond. Mary. Ah, no! I only dread to cherish hope, Because heaven breathes an anathema deep On all my hopes, and turns them to despair: I hoped to have a son—the infant's smile Was for a season mine; but now he smiles Upon his hopeless mother's bitterest foes. I never more shall see his face again!— O, I shall ne'er forget that hated day, (Hated! and yet I love to brood on it,— To speak of it,) when forced to leave my child. I asked but for the respite of one day; No, not a breath! the ruthless lips replied. Just till my infant wake,—I kneeling prayed; Well, well, you may;—such was the harsh response Made to a Queen. Then o'er my babe I knelt, And dreaded to behold, what oft my heart With inexpressible delight had thrilled,— The opening of his eyes, my parting doom. Thus rivetted I gazed, and longer still Had been allowed to gaze upon my child, But that a shower of tears fell from my eyes, And broke his placid slumber.—Woe, woe is me! Adel. O look not round upon the storm that's past. Look forward to the little azure plat Expanding in the clouds; 'twill soon extend Till full upon us shines the heavenly beam. Mary. I fear that this attempt,—lead me to my cell,— Like all the rest, will end in deeper woe. Adel. Keep up your hopes; success will never come Without attempts to win it. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. —Changes to the Castle Garden. The end of the Chapel seen in the back ground. Enter Wingfield. Wing. This fool is at his exorcisms no doubt, A-sprinkling holy lymph to purify An altar for a human sacrifice. Enter Warder. Ward. An please your worship, would you hear some music? There is a pleasant harper here. Wing. No, no; begone!—Music! I hate it. Hast e'er a cross-bow? I would that thou couldst shoot Yon noisy throstle on the yew-tree hedge. [Exit Warder. [The folding-doors of the Chapel open. Francisco, from within, comes forward. The altar, with lights, crucifix, &amp;c. seen at the farther end. A pretty show, indeed: The bait's well gilt; The hook is sharp, and barbed withal; It must not slip Francisco. Douglas seen in the back ground among the trees. Doug. What can this mean? [Aside. Fran. But there's one thing I fear may come to pass; I would not wish, when angling for the trout, To kill the little minnow: I've been informed, There is a lady with the Queen of Scots. Wing. O mind not that; since, if it come to pass, What then? There is no good can be attained Without some ill. Fran. We must somehow avoid a double crime. Wing. If it be possible.—But, good Francisco, There is another point: I know my mistress wishes to obtain Some proof of Mary's guilt, both as to Rizzio, And to the King her husband. Do you think You could persuade her friend to counterfeit The Queen's subscription? I have prepared a writing; It bears a full confession of her guilt. I've heard that this same friend, or secretary, Both pens and signs her mistress' letters. Fran. I'll not take more in hand; I do not know The Queen's companion. Wing. I'll bring you to them now. Fran. I long to see them. [Exeunt. Douglas comes forward. Doug. There's here some villainy devised. A double crime! some proof of Mary's guilt! The little minnow kill—whom? Although the character I cannot read, I can discern the Queen of England's hand; She writes in cypher, with a blood-dipped pen. She's working.—Now, were I some wretch, hope 'reft, Self-doomed to death, but dreading to incur The guilt of suicide, I'd by anticipation expiate That guilt, by stabbing first This empress of all princely hypocrites: I'd be the avenging angel. O, I would stand all hazards for the chance Of striking such a blow; and when 'twas struck, I'd deem the punishment a high reward.— 'Would I could see the Queen once more ere night, But just to say, Beware! I'll try again To wind myself into her presence. [Exit. SCENE VII. —Changes to the Hall of the Castle. (Time—Night.) Enter, to Mary and Adelaide, Wingfield and Francisco. Wing. Father Francisco is come. Fran. God bless your Highness! Mary. Father, I give you thanks. O, I am glad, I'm comforted once more to see That humble habit, and that sacred emblem. Fran. 'Tis the peculiar duty of our order, To minister to prisoners. Mary. You seem to feel, as if you once had felt The misery of them who learn to note The dreary hours by the slow-moving shadow Of staunchel-bars upon the chequered floor; To whom the cheerful sun shines but to tell That life and joy exist, but not for them; Whose serenade is noise of closing bolts; To whom the sweetest sound that meets the ear Is the slow warden's morning-steps ascending, And then the ringing of the loosened hasps; Even the stern face, that seems to grudge a look, And tongue returning monosyllables To anxious questioning, even these Impart a kind of pleasure to the wretch Whose home's the prison-house. Fran. Be comforted. Adel. Be comforted! Fran. How many pine in prisons for the crime Of poverty, who never were accused Of any greater guilt? Mary. The debtor! Oh, his lot is happiness Compared to mine; his friends, those whom he loves, They visit him. Have we not, Adele, marked, The little barefoot boy come to the gate, Bearing his prisoned father's morning mess? At sight of whom the keeper's frown would change Into a smile; and, as he let him in, He'd pitying stroak the elfin's sun-bleached head. I've wished to be the parent of that child. Wing. You would not wish to have your child with you? These gloomy walls would frighten him. Mary. (Reproachfully.) I'd shake this chain before my baby's face, And please him thus, and then he'd smile to me. Fran. Ah! why these bonds? [To Wingfield. Wing. I thought you came to comfort, not to move Her discontent. Fran. Your Highness' thoughts, I trust, are turned to heaven? Mary. Yes; and the more that sorrow fills the heart, Heaven shines more glorious to the sight of hope; As to the tear-filled eye the tiniest star Shoots forth a thousand beams athwart the gloom. Fran. I say it is not seemly, 'tis not right, [To Wingfield. This strict restraint—chains! Wing. Art thou the bearer of the Queen's commission? Mary. See what a furrow in my wrist it makes. [To Francisco. Fran. 'Tis barbarous. Wing. Withdraw, I do command.— [Exit Francisco. To show how much it is my earnest wish To grant your Highness all indulgences, I have allowed this priest to consecrate The chapel; he comes to tell you this, And to announce, that on the morrow morn He will perform the service of the mass, And that you and this lady here may join. He'll be again with you ere night. [Exit. Adel. O what a wretch is that! Mary. The friar had some ruth;— I thought I saw a tear start in his eye. Voice from without. Beware, beware! Adel. O God! that is the voice of Douglas. Mary. 'Tis his:—There's something dreadful meant against us. Farther access, no doubt, they have denied him: 'Twas from the garden that the warning came.— I dread some horrid purpose 'gainst my life: This low'ring Wingfield came not here for nought.— Lead me to my chamber; I'm sick with apprehension: Beware!—that word—it had a heavy knell. I see dark visions float before mine eyes. I used to love to muse on death; but now, Behind his form, I see a hooked wheel, Half-covered with a black, but blood-stained pall, And in his knurled hand, 'stead of a dart, He shakes fell torture-irons.— Bear, bear me from the sight! [Mary leans on Adelaide, looking wildly. Adel. O, Mary, I would die for thee. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. —The Shore of Lancashire. Enter Argyle, Montgomery, Soldiers, and Sailors. Arg. Is she fast moored? for, mark, the heavy clouds Are mustering all around. Sailor. Fast as the lesser bear to the pole. Arg. Speak not so loud. Mont. Douglas, I trust, will soon be here; This should be near the place. Arg. 'Would he were come. 'Twill be a dreadful night.— Look, look—yon flash. Mont. Speak low; perhaps some straggling fishermen May be returning from their day's adventure. Arg. And, hark! that distant, but tremendous peal, Careering round the pitchy vault of night.— Another flash—how nigh! And, hear; that is no distant bolt. 1 Sold. It bodes no good: I wish I were once more Upon the shore of fair Carlavrock bay. 2 Sold. 'Would I were now beneath my smoky roof. Mont. Soldiers, are all your bows securely cased? We'll have a flood ere long,—'tis pattering now. 1 Sold. I hear a foot. Mont. Soldiers, go back a little way.—Keep close And still.—Next flash will shew who comes. Arg. It is not Douglas. Mont. 'Tis Hamilton, I think.— Yes, both our friends. Enter Douglas. Doug. I'm here among my friends, yet scarcely know them.— I trust, you're all arrayed in Kendal green. Arg. All. Doug. My Lord, you're welcome to the English shore. Arg. How does the Queen? Mont. And her fair friend? Doug. They're well as captives are in use to be. The Queen desponds; her friend is full of hope.— But never did I see a night more cross; Darkness would best supply our want of numbers. Mont. The night, indeed, is luckless and perverse; For, as we past the postern-gate, each flash Displayed the castle plain as at high noon; We could have counted every vane, and spike, And pinnacle: One lengthened gleam there was, So bright, I thought I saw the watchman's eyes Peer through a loop-hole of the western tower. Arg. And yet our enterprize brooks not delay. This night must save the Queen, Or plunge her deeper still in ruin. Doug. I know it must, my Lord; retreat is ruin. You've past a broad and boisterous Rubicon. Arg. What is your plan? 'tis you must lead us on. Doug. I will explain it; but 'tis fit our men Should hear.— Comrades, draw near, and listen to the way By which we'll work the rescue of the Queen:— Close to the town of Lancaster, to which I mean to lead you now, There is a grange, whose barn-yard still is stored With the saved increase of the former year; We set it in a blaze, and then retire Into a little grove of trees hard by. Soon we shall hear the alarm of fire resound; The port is opened, out the townsmen run Confused, with pails and buckets, in their haste Half filled: The castle-guard ere long comes down; We watch our time, and straggling, two and three, Pass in, and meet before the castle gate. The porter takes us for their men returned; Besides, I've learned the watch-word for the night, The thistle 'neath the rose; and thus we gain, I think we cannot fail to gain, admission. By guile or force we'll make our entrance good. Arg. So far well planned. Doug. Admitted, instantly we shut the gate, Seize on the keys, secure their keeper, Force him to bring us to the royal chamber:— To lead the Queen, my Lord, will be your part. (What trembling joy in Adelaide's bright eye!) Then through the postern of the western tower Down to the beach; Quick we embark, unmoor, and hoist the sails;— I hear the rapid rushing of the prow. Arg. 'Tis well devised; it scarcely can misgive. Mont. I'll answer on my life. Doug. What say you, friends? [To the Soldiers. 1 Sold. We'll follow trustfully where'er you lead: We long to see our noble Queen once more. She'll look on us with such a look of thanks! To serve her we would rush on death. Doug. Then follow; now's the time; remember Scotland: May Bruce's spirit burn in every breast! [Exeunt. END OF ACT FOURTH. ACT V. SCENE I. —Wiersdale Forest. A Cave seen in the back ground. (Time—Morning.) Enter, from the Cave, Rosa and Maude. Rosa. They said, they would be back or morning, and the sun is almost up— [Singing.] Just crimsoning the mountain crest, And tinselling the lavrock's breast, As he meets the slanting ray, With his merry roundelay. Maude. I fear some mischance has o'ertaken them. Rosa. Why dost fear? Maude. They knew the vicar had been drawing his small tithes; and your pigs, they be the most difficultest things to steal that an honest man can put his hand to: They'll raise ye a rout would split the devil's ears.—I fear there's something wrong. Rosa. Thou'rt always fearing and fearing. Maude. And his wife, too, has the ear of a mouldewart, and she's as watchful as an old gander. Rosa. —But, then, think of the parson's snore; 'tis louder twice than the bellows of a smiddy forge. Maude. But didst not see the lightning? Rosa. No, I was so wearied with the rehearsing. I dreamed the live-long night I was the Queen o' the Fairies, and that the King was so handsome and so kind; and I was so vexed when I opened my eyes and saw your withered face. [Yawning. Maude. Haste to the well; but, hear, take care not to gaze in it at thy pretty self; the very shadow of such a dirty smutched-face ouphe as thee would make it muddy. Swith!—take both pails. Rosa. And your sweet face would look it clear again.—But what can keep them? Maude. Run up first to the Claughton brow, and look for them: Go, and I'll be putting on the bailiff's new pot. [Exeunt different ways. SCENE II. —The Castle Garden. (Time—Morning.) Enter Francisco. Fran. I thought the thunder roared, Woe to Francisco, If he should do the deed!— Can I relume those eyes, restore that form? To look on her, creation's fairest work! Were I an angel, I would quit my sphere, And let the planets reel into confusion, Till chaos again unfurled his flag of night, And, with a thunder-rimmed volcano for his trump, Proclaimed his reign restored.— Destroy thee! No, I never formed The horrible intent: It must have been a dream, which, with mere terror, At last has waked me. Never could I be, It is impossible, so thoroughly a villain, As for a moment harbour in my mind A purpose of such peerless wickedness. [Looks round towards the Chapel, and starts. 'Tis true, too true, here is a living witness. [Pointing to his breast. I must not pray; curses must be my prayers, Curses upon myself, and him who planned So devilish a conspiracy.—I'll find The wretch, and curse him to his face. [Exit. SCENE III. —Changes to Mary's Chamber. Mary leaning on a Couch, Adelaide standing beside her. Mary. I fear they've made the attempt, and been betrayed; The night was now and then as light as noon: The elements denounce hostility 'Gainst Mary Stewart. What an awful night! How couldst thou sleep? Adel. I tried to keep awake, and long kept up My leaden eyelids; the night was then quite still; I dropped asleep, thinking of Douglas. Mary. Didst thou not hear the peals? Adel. No. Mary. But that I'm miserable, I should have swooned With terror: The flashes followed each so fast, That had they followed faster, the night had shone One unremitting blaze: These window bars At times appeared as if of glowing iron; And up this chain there sometimes ran a gleam!— Then fear was gone; I hoped, I did half hope, That it might reach my heart, to which I held The links. But soon I clung to life again; I thought upon my boy; And while the other and the other flash Dazzled my sight, I wished to have my hand across his eyes: Then such a peal would burst, I scarce durst draw My breath, or move.—'Twas terrible; it bodes no good to us. Adel. You are of late so given to omening— Mary. And when it ceased, and sleep o'er powered my senses— O Adelaide! I fear, I fear to tell thee what I saw. Adel. Tell me, and I will read it. Mary. One made me swear an oath I'd not reveal. Adel. A dream! an oath sworn in a dream! 'tis nothing. Mary. I thought me walking in the Abbey garden; The moon shone bright: I wished her not so bright. Adel. What abbey? Mary. Holyrood. Adel. Say on. Mary. I thought I heard a burst of noise, as loud As were the thunder-peals of yesternight. Adel. And— Mary. I thought it came as if from Kirk O'Field; And, ere the echoes of St Antoin's rocks Had ceased, amid a shower of ashes, fell Close at my feet a blackened corse, with eyes unclosed; And, Adelaide,—but let me grasp thine arm,— They glared on Bothwell, who stood rooted by, All horror-struck:—My crucifix I tried To kiss; but ponderous it felt, Down-weighing my weak arm. I fancied next, What I had heard and seen was but a dream, And that I lay, new waked, beside a river, And felt the sunbeams, heard the thrush's note, And saw the wildflowers blooming o'er my face,— When straight the flowers, the trees, the sward, Seemed black and smouldering, and the sky blood-tinged; I turned me round, and feared I should again Behold the horrid form, but saw instead A sanded scaffold, and a sable block; My eyes were dazzled with the gleaming axe;— At sight of which, sudden methought I rushed To throw myself into the gliding stream; But as I stooping paused upon the brink, I saw, not my own image in the wave,— I saw, O Adelaide, I saw the corse, With eyes unclosed, and arms outstretched, to clasp me. At this I woke, and viewed the prison bars And bolts, the dire realities of fate, As objects grateful to my harrowed soul; Then counted o'er these links, to be assured That all was but a dream. Adel. You've uttered horrors—'Tis your hand I feel— Yes, it was but a dream—no more. Mary. But, Adelaide, it is no dream, that still Our friends are absent, and ourselves are captives. Adel. What though they be not come! Douglas is wise as brave, and would not mar, By heedless haste, what might be surer done By short delay. Mary. One circumstance I did forget to tell thee— Adel. Stop—tell it not—banish these dreadful phantasies. Mary. Banish!—what said'st thou about banishment? I'm banished from my country and my child. [Shouting heard without. Adel. They come, they come; we're free! O now for France!—Dear sunny fields!— Mary. Can it be so? [Shouting heard again. O joy! But is't impossible to land in Scotland? Is there not one, One friendly spot, in that ungrateful land I love so well?—which I would die to bless! Enter Warder, looking round the Chamber. Adel. Are they not coming up? Why dost not speak? This fellow is assuming consequence. Mary. Good keeper, speak to us; speak, I beseech you; What means that noise without? [Exit Warder. Mary. I dread— Adel. There is no cause. Mary. Something he had to say. Adel. What then? Mary. It must have been unwelcome tidings. Re-enter the Warder. Ward. The queen's commissioner desires to see you; He's waiting for you on the yew-tree terrace, Close by the chapel; he there expects Francisco. Mary. We're ready; we will come. [Exit Warder, followed by Mary and Adelaide. SCENE IV. —Changes to the Castle Garden. Wingfield solus. Wing. What can detain this lazy lubbard priest? Whatever happen, this shall be signed by her, And then they both, the principal and witness, Shall swallow death. She is so full of pity, She cannot choose but sign it. The rangership! No, that is not enough for such a service. She comes—O I could almost wish To do her good. How grand, (pausing) how fair she seems, Though veiled! I almost rue. Almighty God, How perfect is thy work! Fool that I am! A God!—Come reason, almighty reason, to my aid.— Enter Mary and Adelaide. Good-morrow to your Highness. Mary. Good-morrow. Wing. The day is better than the night foretold. Mary. Where is the friar? 'Twas for him I came. Wing. He will be here. You see my words do not outgo performance. [Pointing to the Chapel. Mary. I thank you. Wing. You have not heard the tidings— Mary. What tidings? Wing. The rescue of the Queen of Scots. [Tauntingly. Adel. O God! Mary. We are betrayed. Wing. Know'st not that prison walls have ears and tongues? Mary. Save us! Wing. And so you knew of it— Mary. Of what? Wing. Hear but this simple story: Lord Hamilton is slain; We tried to take him quick, but on a spear He chose to spit himself, and soon he'll be Quite ready for the worms: Douglas, your valiant errant knight, is safe. Adel. Virgin, I thank thee. Wing. In the viced hand of justice, there he's safe. He slew one of the sheriff's men Before he could be mastered; he was ta'en Redhand: Upon the spot a jury was impanneled, Who found him principal in levying war Against our sovereign lady; a traitor's death his doom: There's one, and but one way to save him, A signed confession of your guilt. 'Tis right You should confess ere you approach the altar. Mary. What guilt?— Wing. Rizzio and Darnley, the paramour and husband. Adel. Bid me confess! I'm ready to confess All crimes, the deepest, if you'll save his life. Wing. The lazy Spaniard comes at last.— Enter Francisco. Welcome, Francisco, we've been looking for you. You've got all ready in the chapel? Fran. No. Wing. What— Fran. I say no. Wing. What dost thou mean? Fran. Thou'rt an assassin; I the intending and accursed accomplice. Wing. Thou'rt mad; thou know'st thou'rt in my hand. Fran. I scorn thy power; I will not damn myself. Wing. Thou wretched fool! this day shall be thy last; Beyond these walls thou ne'er shalt pass again. Fran. I do despise, detest thee, monster, Almost as much as I abhor myself. O that I from myself could turn, as now I do From that loathed sight—a villain clothed with power! Wing. I'll hurl thee to the death upon the point Of but a single word; my voice will blast thee. Fran. Beware of him. [ To the Queen. Wing. Be dumb, or this is in thy heart. Mary. I see it all. Wing. Have you resolved? Mary. On what? Wing. You do not know whose fate hangs on my word. Mary. No. Adel. No—whose? Wing. Hear you that slowly passing noise Of footsteps numberless? I wish these windows But looked that way; you'd see a noble show. Adel. It is, it is—I see it all:—Douglas, O Douglas! Mary. A hubbub dull; with now and then a voice Of hurry and command, I hear.—What can it mean? Adel. O! are you blind? Douglas is in that crowd: He's now encircled by the sheriff's spears. Your word, O Mary, it can rescue him; Speak, speak the word. Wing. Hark, hark, the trumpet sounds! Know you its tune? It is the march of death. I know it well, Although 'tis rudely blown. That is your Douglas's departing knell. Adel. O! Mary. Fear not, dear Adelaide, it cannot be. He but deceives; yet 'tis a savage jest. Wing. Ye'll know ere long, I sometimes speak the truth. Mark ye the flag above the red-rose tower? Mary. What then? Wing. I pray you, mark it. Mary. I do. Wing. 'Tis white. Mary. I mark it; it can mean no harm to us, Or to our friends? Wing. Are you prepared to sign? [Presenting the Paper. Mary. Let me look at it—Never. [Throws it from her. Wing. Promise to sign ere night. Mary. Never. Wing. Douglas, ere this, is on the gallow moor; His life hangs on that flag. Will you relent? Adel. Mary! Mary. Subscribe to my own infamy! Wing. The red flag will be raised, the signal for the stroke. Adel. Mary! Mary. Shall I confess myself a murderess? Wing. He'll die a traitor's death. Mary. What— Wing. His heart, before he's dead, will be torn out, And burnt before— Adel. O can you, Mary, bear to hear of this? Am I your Adelaide—Does Douglas love me— Do I love him—and did he rescue you?— Mary. Would he had never rescued us! But if you look so, I will say or do Just what you wish; I will own any thing. Adel. 'Tis coming down—the white—it drops—O stop! Good, gentle Wingfield, stop! Wing. 'Tis now but falling with the falling breeze. Mary. What shall I say? I will say any thing. Wing. Thus you'll propitiate my sovereign's pardon. Mary. Your sovereign's pardon!—pardon didst thou say? [Contemptuously. Wing. And save the life of Douglas. Mary. I will not, no—I'm innocent. To save myself, I would not own a crime Of which I'm guiltless; no, not to save my child— No—though thou o'er his cradle threatening held'st A poniard in one hand, and in the other That false acknowledgment,—I'd bid thee strike. Wing. Wilt thou persuade her?— Adel. Give me the writing.— [Looks at it—tears it. Now let Douglas die! I'll choose for him, he is myself; I know He would prefer death to the Queen's dishonour. Wing. I see you're frantic, and I'm loath to take Advantage of your madness; yet a few minutes I wish to grant, to give you time to think; But if, when I return, you still persist In this most foolish hardiness, the sign Of peace must down, and in its stead— [Exit. Mary. Where can I turn me? Am I doomed to doom Poor Douglas to his death! Fran. Be silent. Mary. My silence is his sentence. Adel. And can you utter it?— Mary. It was but now you tore my condemnation, And tearing it, you tore his pardon too. Adel. I knew not what I did. Fran. Do what is right and true, and trust in God. Mary. I will do what thou bid'st me, Adelaide. Adel. O save my Douglas—quick, quick—be resolved— I hear, I hear the wretch's foot return. Mary. I said I would not seal my infamy To save my son from the assassin's dagger; But yet, for thee, I'll murder my good name, And on its scutcheon write, adulteress, Aye, assassin, traitress—what you will, I'll say. Enter Wingfield. Adel. Douglas must die. Wing. Your name, I think, is Adelaide? Adel. What then? It is. Wing. I thought it was; I heard it breathed by him While in the dungeon of the Lune-side port: After he was condemned, He lay an hour there. Adel. O Douglas! Douglas! Douglas! Wing. And when drawn up, and led into the light, Though at the first, the glaring sea of eyes Seemed to confound him, soon as he discerned These battlements, To them his face continued, as he passed Along, still turned; he only once looked round, Eying on either side, with proud contempt, The gazing roofs. Adel. Yes, he despises death; His soul floats tranquil on the storm of fate, As the heaved sea bird, with its wing-veiled head, Sleeps reckless of the surge's rise or fall; And shall I wish to save the life he scorns, Ransomed at such a price,—my Queen's, my friend's dishonour? Wing. Mark but the fateful stillness all around; There's not one foot in the late bustling street; Which seems as if a pestilence had swept The human throng away: Both old and young Are at the show; none but the bedrid absent: There's not a crutch in Lancaster this day. Look up—these ravens trooping to their quarry, They wind their prey afar. Mary. Miscreant! thy words, far from appalling me With the full marshalled horrors of this day, They steel my heart; the dire reality Daunteth not Douglas, and shall the description Intimidate me into infamy? Fran. 'Tis nobly said. Wing. Another word, and I will stab thee. Mary. And say that I had given my consent To ransom Douglas with my reputation!— Adel. And have you given your consent— Mary. And say that I had given my consent To perpetrate this perjury 'gainst myself; How could I trust that such a man as this Would show the thievish honesty to keep The dear bought paction? No, he's self-absolved Of every tie, both human and divine. From my repenting hand the wretch would take The extorted scroll, then with triumphant look, Half smile, half grin, which fiends would vie in vain To match, he'd laugh at my simplicity. I dare thee, wretch, to do thy very worst. Wing. I will. [Waves his hand. Down—down—the white drops down; and see, the sign Of blood ascends, and from its floating train Sheds death. [Trumpets heard at a distance. Adel. [As if waking from a stupor] —Pardon! it is proclaimed—I heard it. Wing. None in these parts, save me, prossesses power To pardon; no, that trumpet bays to drown The rabble-rousing words of Douglas. Adel. O Mary, Mary!—Am I speaking to her? Mary. A secret indignation has dried up All tears, all pity. Adel. My friend—my sister—myself! Wing. The blow is struck; fruitless were now your tears; Your lowliest suit were vain; he gasps, he dies, And now cut down half lifeless, falls: The hangman's hand now revels in his breast, And gropes to catch the fluttering heart; the heart Eludes the grasp; aye, now he tears it out: Now a sweet-smelling incense it sends up Most grateful to Elizabeth: and now— Now, with tucked sleeve, the butcher hand is twisted Into the traitor's locks, and now the head Is held on high, convulsed, whilst thus a voice Proclaims, So die our sovereign's enemies. [Adelaide falls. Fran. What so relentless as a tyrant's malice! It even survives the wretched victim's death: 'Tis like the raging of the infuriate waves, Which, as if all unsated with the life Of the poor mariner they've overwhelmed, Still toss, and dash, and mangle his drowned corse Upon the rugged rocks. Wingfield stamps—Enter Guards. Wing. Drag in this traitorous priest, And let him down into the deepest dungeon; And, that he ne'er may from the bottom rise, Load him with triple irons. Mary. O Adelaide, I have killed thee! Of all the woes That Mary Stewart suffers, none is so bitter As is the bitter thought, that she is still The cause of ruin to her dearest friends. Wing. Your friends! no longer shall you have to say I see the face of friend. Mark me; henceforth You are cut off from all the charities Of life; she that lies there woe-stunned, And you, must part; no longer shall ye plot Escapes: To Bolton she must go, and you To Fotheringay.—Imprisonment till death Must be your doom. Ne'er shall the vernal gale Play round your head: Sighed through your window grate 'twill faintly fan Your feverish temples, while mayhap you stretch Your hand beyond the bars, and on it look With envy, as it waves to feel the air. Mary. O Adelaide! [Falls on her. Adel. [Recovering, delirious.] Where is he laid? O lay me in his grave! 'Tis a sweet couch, 'tis downy soft. Wing. A grave!—look up, high up: Seest thou yon pinnacle With fluttering shreds bedecked, the only relics, Left by the ravens, of some rebel's fate? Your Douglas' quartered arms shall there be blazoned. [She dies. Mary. O that the Omnipotent had not denounced A curse against self-murder. Self-murder! No, there is another hand; I see, I see it raised, though dim the view. Misfortune such as mine inspires the soul With powers prophetic. Yes, I now discern, Through a long scutcheoned aisle of gloomy years, A scaffold close the dismal perspective. Wing. Bear her off. Mary. Bereave me miserable, if not of life, Of reason; dash down the conscious power, and make My soul a dream without an interval. [Curtain falls.</field>
