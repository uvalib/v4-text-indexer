      <field name="fulltext">The Preface. Drawe nere gentill reader and harken to mee, Her stondes Dauid Dicar Dremynge as you see. He sleapethe, and wakes not, but dremethe on still. To scanne what he dremeth eche man hathe a will. Some dothe him blame for his restles mynde. Whiche sleape causeth him Dreme by naturall kynde And some doth praise his labouringe reste, Thonghe Dreminge in sleapinge be not the best. And s?e saithe that sleaping nedes no Dremes at all Whiche yet neuer hathe ben, nor to come neuer shall. And somme wolde correcte Dauids Dreme to amende, Before he hath Dremed his Dreame to the ende And some do interpret what his Dreame ment. Declaringe the secrettes of Dauids intent. And some do immagyne Dauid Dicar to lye In doges sleape this Dremynge, eche man for to trye. But Dauid dreames on and thinkes no man ill. And sufferthe eche man to worke on his will And somme men dothe whisper suche neppes in his eare whiche efte now and then Dauid dicar dothe heare, Then answeringe sleapinge he momblethe this out, And cawllethe th? fomblers that stondes him aboute. As the whetstone beinge dul good edges dothe sette. So Dauid dreamynge still, sharpe wits he dothe whette And causethe the wakinge, to worke all ther will. From sleaping his dreming to fetche out the skill Yet some will not cease to shake him by the slyue Withe taunting poore Dauid from dreaminge to driue And some in this dreaminge dothe ponder so depe That in stoddinge of dreaminge they fall asliepe. And some are so weried that they may no more Answer dauid dicar as they dide to fore, And some cannot scarclie answer a whene Till time dothe determyne to shewe forthe a thene Sithe certaine of vncertain no stronger takethe holde Let him blowe the cole, that is moste a coulde Sure this is the beste waye for wisemen to take. To let slepers and dreamers alone till they wake, As plainlye apperethe by this fine witted men. In tossinge and tomblynge of Dauid dicars when. Thus beating thair brains in vain they do toyle. And clokethe ther wittes for feare of the foyle. The one dothe affirme the other dothe defende. Yet neither of either canons make anende. The ende of the preface. Dauy Dycars Dreame. When faith in fr?? esl ere fruit and folysh fr?cyes fade, And crafty catchers cum to nough, &amp; hate gret loue hath made. When fraud flieth far from towne, &amp; loytrers leaue y? fielde, And rude shall runne a right full race, &amp; all m? be wel wilde when gropers after gayne, shall carpe for comon welth, And wyly workers shall disdaine, to fygge &amp; lyue by stelth when wisdome walkes a loft, and folly syts full low, And vertue v?quish pampred vice, &amp; grace begins to grow. when Iustice ioynes to truth, and law lookes not to meede, And bribes help not to build fair bowres, nor giftes gret glotons fede. when hongere hides his head and plenty please the poore, And niggerdes to y? nedy m?, shall neuer shut their doore- when double darke deceit, is out of credit worne, And fauning speche is falshed found, and craft is laught to skorne when pride which pickes the purs, gapes not for garmentes gay. Nor iaveles wear no veluet weedes, nor wandring wits bere sway when riches wrongs no right nor power poore put backe, Nor couetous crepes not into Courte, nor lerned, liuing lack wh? slipper sleights are seene and far fatches be founde, And priuate proffit &amp; selfe loue shall both be put in pounde: when dete no sergeant dreeds, and cowrtiers credit keepe, And might melles not with merchandise, nor lordes shall sell no sheepe: wh? lucere lasts not long, and hurd great heaps doth hate, And euery wight is well contente, to walke in his estate, when truth doth tread y? strets and liers lurke in den, And Rex doth raigne and rule the rost, and weedes out wicked men: Then baelful barnes be blyth that here in England wonne, Your strife shall stynt I vndertake, your dredfull dayes ar done. To Dauid Dicars when. To him that doth dreame, Dauid Dicars when. And euen so from hym, to such othermen. Fr? when vnto when, to come to this when wh? fools of your folly, will worke lyke wyse men, And know theyr owne fautes and leaue faulting other. And fyrst m?de th? selues, and then warne theyr brother, Enuiyng none, for that theyr sorte is not Such as they would be, lyke others I wot. Goddes of degree, to rule and beare swaye, whose maners mete not, to stand in such stay, And yet wold haue mouthes, to rore like the Lyon Beyng but Asses brute of c?dicion Esorne de asino tug?s forgettynge that order doth thus aske and craue, That eche should hym selfe in order behaue. As baestes of lowe sorte, to be mek of theyr mynde, To those that be hygher, and greater of kynde. The Bore not to bragge, to stryue wyth the Lyon. The Hart not to stand, with the Bull in contention, The Oxe that doth draw, to thyncke hym selfe able, To runne for a wager, with the Horse of the stable. It grees not, it cordes not, nor orderly fyttes That men should fynd fault, with Gods and theyr wyttes Iupiters seate standes some what to hye. For vs to iudge it, that come it not nye. And iudgementes or gesse, in any such sorte, May serue to the Gods, for a laughter and sporte To se how Iudas, would fayne become Iuda. To iuste at the life, of Iuli apostata, Let Beastes that be meete, for carte and caryage, Leane to theyr laboure, as manne to hys maryage. And synce we be members of one common wealthe. Let vs ioyne aptly, as fyttes for our health. The eye as the eye, let hym stare and looke, And let the leg learne, to bow and to crooke. Let the hand answere, to help and to dooe, As the wyll of the hert, shall wyll hym vnto. And let not the foote, make murmur and cry. To aske why our head, is placed so hye. Our instrument iaeres, it makes no ryght melody, If we thus tune not to order our armony. Then mayster when, when bothe you and I, And euery man els wyl learne to applye, To our ryght metyarde, and kepe oure iust compasse, And looke not so deepe in an other mannes glasse. And leaue dreaming dreames of dead Dauid Dicar, And send such whens home, to our person or vicar. And ther wyth remember, thys verse of Cato, Whose wysdom doth warne vs, with these wordes I trowe. Que íoles culpare, ea'tu ipse: ne feceris. when wee marke this nipse, And leaue drawyng diales, on other mens dooyng And learne for to looke to our owne woorkes and brewynge Then I say then, when yon agayn when: will say well your selfe, and suche other men, And all folke wyll doo well. Lo thus I ende then, All thynges shall bee well, whiche god graunt. Amen. The debate betwyn A Replication vnto Camels Obiection. If right or reason, might moue you to speake, I wold not you blame, your malyce to wreake: Or if your iudgement, were vp right and cleane, You wold not so rudely, consture what I meane. How should your foli, so plaily be knowne. If that your wisdome, abrode were not blowne. You byd me amende, whose life you know not. As though that in you, there were not a spot. A tale of a tubbe, you bragge and you brall, Wherin you do rubbe, your self on the gall. You touche not one poynt, wher of that I wrate. You leape ore the hedge, and seeith not the gate, I muse what yon meane, to discant and preache, Upon a plaine song, so farre past your reache. why Camell I say, wyl you needes be fyne? what, wyll ye be knowne, for a durty deuine? It seemes you are learned, past reason or wyt, Or els you coulde not, y? mark so well hyt. You haue so good laten, you can want no pewter, Though ye are no foole, yet you are a newter. You writ like a clerke, or seyene well in Cato, Forgetting your name, which Therens cals Gnato. I can do no lesse, but shew what you are, Synce you ar a Daniel, dark dreames to declare. Your knowledge is great, your iudgement is good, The most of your study hath ben of Robyn hood. And Beuys of Hampton, and syr Launcelot de lake, Hath taught you full oft, your verses to make: By sweete sa?t Benet, I swere by no foole, you are not to learne, you plyde well your scole. Your wyts are not breched, who list you to preeue, you flocke and you flout, and smils in your sleeue. I prayse you no more, lest you thinke I flatter, I must now retourne, to thee pith of my matter. How can you wel proue, that I do enuye, At any estate, be they low or hye, Or that I spye fauts, in Iupiters seate, why are you so mad, on me thus to bleate, It grees not, it cords not, it fyts not you say, That men shuld find faut, with gods that bere sway If plaine Dauy Dicar with wise men be skande, He seaketh vprightly, I dare take in hande. I write not so rashly, but I rule my pen. In faith you mistake, Dauy Dicars, when, you take chauke for chese, and day for darke night, Of like you are spurblinde, or ye loke not a right: you purpose I know, you were in such care, Against this good tyme, your purs was full bare. yon thought to optaine, some garment or gift, Then dyd you inuent, to make a foule shift, To flater the Gods, and get a new cote, That made you to syng, so mery a note. yon faine me like Iudas, you thinke me not so, For if I were he, then you wold me know, I beare not the bagge, that may you rewarde, But yet my good wyll. I pray you regard. you say that order, wold haue eche degree, To walke in his calling: then how may this be, That you out of frame, do blother and barke, So lyke a curre dogge, at euery good warke. Is this the order, that Camels do vse? Bicause you are a beast, I must you exscuse. A Camell, a Capon a Curre sure by kynde, I may you well call, synce so I you fynde: Bicause you haue ratled, and railed to mytch, Now giue me good leue, to claw you wher ye ytch. And if that you thinke, I rub be you to sore, Then giue me no cause, to scratch you no more. Holde thys for certayn, and for asure thing, The ofter you styrre me, the more I will styng. Syns that you wyll nedes, a waken my wittes. I wyll seeke for you, both snaf fuls and bittes. To holde in your head, and make you to rayne. And byte on the bridle, for angre and payne. Then will I deuise, for you such a burthen. As long as you liue, you shal beare a lurden: A Camell by kinde, wil beare more at once. Then .iii. great horses. pick-out for the nonce. More meeter for yion, to be in some stable. To beare heauy burthens, I thinke you more able. Then being as you are, walking abrode. Your limmes ar well made to carie a great lode: All beastes that be made, for carte and cariage, Shuld leane to their labour as man to his mariage. with horses and Asses, you are well acquainted. Their maners in ordere, right wel you haue painted. I dout of your shape, some monster you are, Bicause such a name, to me you declare. Your wordes and your workes, ar tokens right sure. You ar some brute beast, in mans forme and picture. Right happy he were, y? had you in charge. He shuld gaine moch money, to shew you at large. what cause, or what toye, dyd trouble your mynde: To make you seeke fauts, wher non you can finde, Your instrument iarres, your myrth is not sweete, You play on false stryngs which thing is vnmeete. Your eare is not good, you know no sweete sounde. You can not espie, where faut may be founde. So farre out of tune, I neuer hearde none, Nor so much past shame, nor yet so farre gone. As you in this case, God sende you to amende. Which seekes to learne me, to bow and to bend: Direct well your steppes, by order and lyne. and sclaunder me not, nor no workes of myne. In all my writinges, right-honestly I ment. If they betaken, to my true entent: Thei shal breede no strife, nor no error sowe. when truth shalbe tryde, and vertue shall floow.

Therfore I suffre, all your wordes, which is mine enemi knowne, I could you serue, with taunting tearmes, and feede you with your owne. But I m?de not to chock your tale, before the worst be tolde. Then may I haue, fre choyce and leaue, to shew you wher you scolde. Good syr if I shulde you salute, as you saluted me. Then skuld I call you, Dauy too, and so perchauce you bee. Ye multiplye, fyue names of one, a progeny you make. As your desent, dyd comme from thence, wher of you lately spake. Though such as you, haue nyck named me, in gest and halfe in scorne, Churchiard I am, in Shrewisbury towne, thei say wher I was borne You put your name, to others works, y? weklings to be gild. Me thinke you are, somwhat to younge, to father such child The truthe ther of, is eeth to know, a blynd m? may discus Ye are in n?bre, mo then one, ye saye, bee good to vs. You say, I did not aunswer you: I could no mattier finde Nor yet can see, excepte I shulde, at folli wast my minde The gretest shame, and most reproch, that any man may haue, Is for to write, or scoulde with fooles, hose nature is to raue. Synce railing rims, orcoms your wits, talke on and bable styll, I not entende, about suche chats, my p? nor speche to spil. I neither fume, nor chaunge my moode, at ought that you haue sayde. The world may iudge, your railyng tong, full like a beast hath brayd. And where you say, you can poynt out, by lyne and leuell both. Of all the, whens, of Dycars dreame, you say you knowe the troth. It is a wilfull ignoraunce, to hyde, I knowe full well, I faute, agaynst Iuppiters seate, or agaynst his counsell. You shew yourselfe, not Iupiters frende, if you can truly proue. A faute in me, &amp; doeth it hyde for feare or yet for loue. As for my works, &amp; thankles paynes, in this &amp; such lik case. I shall be redi to defende, wh? you shall hide your face. Th?ke you I feare, what you c? do, my gro?de is iust &amp; true On euery worde, which I did speak, I fore not what ye brue Fyll all your chargers, as ye list, and dishes euery chone, when they be full, and r?neth ore, I will cast you a bone. whiche shall be harde, for you to pyke, though that your wits be fyne, I can sone put you out of sqar from your leuell and lyne: I wyll not answere word for worde, to your reioindre yet, Because I fynde no matter there, nor yet no poynt of wyt, But brabling blasts, and fr?tike fyts, &amp; chyding in y? ayre, Why doo you fret thus with yourself, fye man do not dispayre: Though that your wyts, be troubled sore, if you in Bedl? weare. I thinke you shuld be right wel kept, if you be frended theare: If you were scourged once a day, and fed with some warm meate. You wolde come to your self again, after this rage of heate This may be said without off?ce, if y? your wyts you had You wolde not lye nor rail on me, nor fare as you wer mad. But as it is a true prouerbe: y? threatned man lyues long, Your words c? neither hang nor draw, I feare not your yl tong. The world is such it doth c?tempne, all those that vertue haue. An euell tong hath no respect whose name he doth depraue what is the cause of mortall food, which dothe in frendes arise, But comenly these sclaunder tonges, whiche still delyts in lyes: who maketh war, who soweth strife, who br?geh Realmes to ruine: But plenty, pride and euell tonges, whose voyce is nere in tune, The roote and branche and chefeest gro?de, of mischeefs all and some, Is euyll tongues, whose sugred words, hath wyse m? ouercome, The proofe wher of you put in vse, your words ye frame and set, To creepe into some noble hertes, a credit for to get. The eatyng worme within y? nut, y? sweetest curnell seke, So doo you drawe where gayne is got, and there you looke full meeke. But vnder those fayr angels loks is hyd a deuelish minde I durst lay oddes who trust you long, ful false he shall you finde. Now to returne vnto thee cause, whiche made you first to write, You shew your selfe to be a foole, to answer me in spite. The first and last that I haue sene, of al your nipping geare Is not well worth when fruit is cheape, y? paring of a peare Your sodain stormes and th?dre claps, your boasts and braggs so loude. Hath doone no harme thogh Robyn Hood, spake with you in a cloud.

A Decree betwene Churchyarde and Camell. A decree vpon the dreame made by Dauy Dicare, with answer to Camel, whose tauntes be more quicker. Wher Dicar hath dreamed of thinges out of frame. And Churchiarde by writing affirmeth the same, And Camell contendeth, the same to deface, And therfore hath put hys doynges in place. Sythe both of those twayne hath set foorth in myter The wordes of the Authour, skyll of the wryghter. And rune in this race, styll chaffyng the bytte. I thynke in thys case muche more then is fytte. I myndyng as much as lyeth in me. To mak them both, as mone to agree Haue taken in hande y? dream to defende And so to recite theyr race to the ende. Not so to approue my learning or skill But onely because it be commeth them yll. From riming to rayling so ofte to dygresse, wher as reason and wyt doth wil nothing lesse. As Dicar hath dreamed so time out of minde, Dicars Dreame Some thynges were amys, that some men dyd fynde, If al thynges were wel, as I woulde god they were, we shoulde not be plaged fr? yeare vnto yeare, If all men do ryght, what nedeth the lawe, what nede any iustice to h?ge and to drawe, If no man be wronged nor wydowe oppressed, Then nedeth no care to haue it redressed, If no man wil v?ter to robbe or to steale, O England thou hast a good common weale. If no man do hurde nor hydeth in store, Then England shall haue no dearth any more If no man offend by way of excesse. Then grace doth abound, the fault is the lesse, If the lustes of the fleshe be pute oute of vre The world is amended the people be pure. If the poore and the nedye be daylye reliued, what man is so mad, therat to be greued? If no man do slaunder nor styre vp debate, Then Dicar I thinke hath dreamed to late. If no m? do flater, nor fawne for againe. Then may it appeare this dreame is but vain. If all thing be wel, and in the ryght waye, why do they not vse good lawes to obey. If no man defraude in bying nor sellyng. Then happy is England, for ther is best dwellyng. If faith be vnfained, and wordes do once bynde, The dreame is all false, and so ye may finde. If truth do take place and in all thinges encreasse, dreame no more Dicar, but lette thy dreame ceasse, If this be not so then Camell to you. I feare me thys dreame wyll proue to be true. For it is not so geeson withe vs for to heare, But the effect of thee dreame doth dayly appeare. And euery man is now in such takinge, It passeth a dreme, they finde it out waking If you be suche a one as neuer had peere, Then are you fauty in none of this geere. But seyng your writyng doth seme some what quycke, You seme that ye smarted because ye did kycke. Yet when the dreame was to printing dyrected, I thincke of the dreamer ye were not suspected. And where as you contende it doth not belonge, For Dicar to dreame of right haue or of wronge. In ded you dooe well yf you done amis, To shewe him his faulte, and say thus it is, And if you so well know what doth Dicar behoue, Then ought you to shewe the same to approue. But me thincketh you want a frendli good will. To deface a good matter though the authour wer ill. And certes of you both indifferentli to tell I cannot in your railinges c?mend your doings well. And both of you twaine are yet to me vnknowen, Yet can I aide your doinges, as if they were mine own, Ye passe from your purpose in such vnworthi sorte. Ye make of your doinges a very laughing sporte. Ye close and ye glose, in seking to be fine, Ye taunt and retaunt al most in eueri line. Ye affirme ye haue red both Terence and Cato, Ye co?t ye do but faletrye wel resemble Gnato. And looke howe much differs a Foxe from a foole, Su much do you differ from Cato and his scole, For Cato doth affyrme ther is no greater shame, Then to reproue a vyce, and your selues to do thee same. And because I wyl not seeme your fancy to embrace, As touching your debate, I answer in this case. Me thinketh in wrytynge ye both haue such skyll, Ye marre a good matter and make it very yll. wherby to say the truth it appeareth well vnto me, Your names and your wytts vnnumerable be. Therfore do not thinke that ye can be forborne. But such as be readers shall laugh you to scorne. And when that your doynges be throughly perused, Then by the same deedes ye shalbe accused. Cease nowe in season cast all contempt away, Be subiect vnto reas?, &amp; make no more delay. And eyther of you twane do not refuse to knowe, As Cato doth enstructe you but strayght embrace it so which though my skil be smal here thought I to reherse The text and sence wythe all of euery kynde of verse. Contra verbosos noli contendere nerbis. Sermo datur cunctis auimi sapiencia paucis, Cum recte viuas ne cures verba malorum. Arbitri nostri non est quid quisque loquatnr. To striue with men of many words, refrain I the aduise It is not geuen to euery man that he shalbe godlye wyse.

He wyll aswage your strudy stormes which you haue reised so Take this in worth good Reder now expound it to y? best: For I haue sayd to theyr deuyce, now harcken to the rest. The iudgement of the Authour. Some thyng is a mys and euer shalbe so Scripture writeth thys as learned men do knowe. And some men haue the gyft therof to speake and wryte which fal yet at a lyfte to frail and fonde delyte. It doth behoue vs al so iustly as we canne, To do right wel in dede, and eke to wryte it thanne. How be it, in hym I iudge muche greater faulte, there is whiche noght can saye nor do, but that which is a mys. The best may be am?ded, and that is very true The moore that haue offended, the more we ought to rue If any fall from grace gentelly hym assayle, Burden him wyth charity, no rygour can preuaile, For why, if that the shepherde do wander from the waye, No maruell if the shepe therafter go astraye Some men perhappe ther be wyl take me to the wourst, I pray you iudge of me, as I spake it at the fyrst For it becommeth yll in writting to contende, without wytte or skyll to mak a rayling ende Take me to the best, as one to you vnknowen, Whose worthy wits I do c?mend &amp; wold with you be one. Not minding so assuredli to spende and waste the daie, To make the people laugh at me, and here I make a staye, Westerne Wyll, Upon the debate betuyxte Churchyarde and Camell Rowe thy bote thou ioli ioli mariner, and wind well vp thy sayle, For thou mightest neuer w?d it vp better thine own self for to auaille. There ware thre meri mariners, that dwel in Maldon meade That coulde skil of winde and ryde, of canell and of streame And eke theyr compasse well directe, from euery shore and steade And ware acqueinted with y? rockes, and sandes the myght them queame Fr?

A Craier had they prest to sail and all their takle yare And al their fraught ybrought a borde; to wende to Maldon towne But for the winde was not y? best, before they forth wolde fare They thought y? citie for to rowne, and viewe it vp &amp; downe If thing vncouth they there might fynde, wher with to moue some glee Wh? they came home to Maldon meade, amonge their companie. To Poules they hied as place most fytte, for newes in their deuice Amonge the printers gan they searche, and busilye enquire For thinges that might for Noueltie, at h? be had in price The printer sayd he thought he had, to pleasen theyr desyre And drewe then nere into his shoppe, and gan vnfolde then light A rolle of Rithimes, wher of the fyrst, the dickers dreame it hyght. Then folowed aunswere to this dreame, to Dauie dickers whan A solempne processe at a blusshe, be quoted here &amp; there With matter in thee margent set, wheron to gase they gan But they ne wist for ought I knewe, but hebrue y? it were A Replication was the next, whiche well I vnderstoode For y?

Of ioyncture right for way warde wyues, to pleaden at the barre But ay the printer pressed on, and take them all quod he I notte your nammes, but brethren myne, I you assure can They be as good as in this to wuin any shoppe there be Our names quod he, and one stepped forth, a wight yonge watere man Wylkin is my name, and this is watte, and Herm? high the thirde As trusti and sure at tackle knotte, as euer with corde was gird. Well Wilkin, Watte, an Herman gent, by all your names I sweare Ye shall not nede vpon my worde, to stande in any doubt A merier iest ye can not finde, a boord with you to beare So will ye say your selues I knowe, when ye haue red it out. But if ye be vnlearned to red, as mariners lyghtly be Then yf ye lyst to harke a whyle, ye shall it heare of me.

It me behoueth fyrst to tell, good order asketh that wherfore a whyle gyue eare I pray, tyll I those twayne set out And then ye may your fancye say, by turne eche one about. This Diker sems a thryuing ladde, brough vp in pieres scole. The plowman stoute, of wh? I thynke ye haue full often harde. A swynckyng swaine, that handleth wel his spade and other toole Full loth hee ware for lake of hede, they shulde bee reckly marde For why in them and in his hande, his lyuynge chefely standes He bragges not of rentes fees ne of entayled landes And yet he semeth a curtouse hind, &amp; comen of good stocke For Dikers feawe in my contrey, so well ythewed bene I warraunt you who lyest him preue, he is no spritelesse bloke But to my tale, In cockowe tyme when eche thing gan to grene all weried from his worke, retournes this Dauy Diker hende And for to ease him selfe the bet, full softely gan he wende. Unto his house with? a groue a lytle there besyde His bottle and his bagge, he hent, he left them not behinde Wherin remayned but small surplus, of viande at that tyde And downe he sate hym on the benche, of meate had lytle minde But gan complaine his verinesse, and one his hande his bedde He did arrest, and cleped wyfe as though he wolde to bedde. Lo dame he sayd thou wotest I troue, that candle is to diere To sytte vp late and praten out our thrift til farther night And eke I nil no supper haue, lette be put out the fiere.

Then Wylkyn gan at once vp brayde, and sware by godes dyne harte A rushe for bookes, me leuer warre that I could tel this tale Then of your scablings for to haue, a loade by wayne or carte Strawe for suche peltry, it is good to stuffe an empty male I durst it take vpon my soule in all this lyther thinge Is not a tale that may bee fo?de so muche to my lykinge. Yea yea quod wat, my selfe by gisse, in youth might this haue learned If I so wyse or happie had b? to folowe my fathers wyll who would haue spent vpon my scoole so muche as he had earned But I was bent another waye, methought it very yl All daye to rucken on my taile, and poren on a booke It was nothing vnto my paye full soone I it forsoke. But Herman here our other mate, it was a wytty elfe Ado, ado, quod herman then &amp; printer yet go forth what was the Dreame that Dauy mette as he it tolde him selfe For yet me thinketh by thy feare, that Dreame is somme what worth.

It semeth wel he h? bethought vpon the worldes change And of his drudge and myckel paine, when he to bed did go And th? to dreame of such like th?ges, per di it is not stra?ge Suche as mitalke &amp; thoghts haue bene y? dai befor certain Such things again at night in slepe, my drem hath shewed me plaine. And eke I harden ones, &amp; right good doctour tell that such as farced go to bed, with meate and drinke goode stoore Theyr dreames alwaye to them in more dysorder fell Then yf they empty went to bedde, as ye haue hard before That Dauie dyd whose supper was, so slender &amp; so short That nothinge els but wearinesse, and nature caused him snort A dreame, a strawe quod Wylkin then, by God it was noswenyn Men dreame of deuyls, of apes, and owles, of naked gyrles and boyes But I ne thinke this dreame is such, it hitteth thinges so euen It talketh with good reason round, of fansies ne of toyes But of suche thinges as I cannot, amenden with my wytte Nor neuer shall I thynke befounde, reformed euery whytte. No quod the printer no, that ment not thee dreame I vndertake But where as many thinges ben found, that mans wit can not fatche To mende as many as we can, and thee rest a paterne make. To bringe our stat as reyghe to them, as mans deuyce can mache As out of Platoes commen welth, a tale I coulde you tell of many thynges that hee wolde haue, and not but very well: That neuer yet in earthe ware founde, as hee wolde haue them done Quod watte no more of Platoes lore, I ken hym not by gysse Ne care not muche excepte he coulde somme rules for chaunge of mone But well I wot algates and am full sure of this That I haue harde the preachers speake, of asmuche as is here And of mo thinges than any man, is able to comme nere But ay methinkes it is fine, for such a rude vplande It ware ynoughe for a right good clerke, at instyuynsty taught He had is helpe his parysshe prest I venture durst my h?de what thoughe hee coulde it dreame thus right, yet I belyue it naught That he coud with such que?t prouerbes, his dreame at large endite And eke I thinke thee sely swaene, dyd neuer learne to write. No watte quod thee printer tho, thou harpest on the truth This Diker had a frende in court that well coulde handle pen with whom he was acq?einted earst, as play felowes in youth who for they then companions warre dyd him vouch safe to ben. And loued Dauy euermore, in him suche truth there was And Dauy when hee came to town, vns?e wold not h? pas. Befell vpon a market daye, when he this dreme haue had That he to Lond? list resort, for thinges that stod him nied He founde his frinde, and all this dreme, at length vnto him radde And he for y? it semed a thinge the penninge worth in diede Gan drawe it into frame, and shapen as ye harde And one that lust it fantasien, to printinge it prefarde. Lo nowe I haue y? halfe perfourmed, that I you earst behight what maner man this Diker was, and howe this dreame came out And nowe I will to Camell passe, if ye therin dilight By whom this ioly sturre, is chiefly brought aboute And tell fro pointe to pointe, as earst I dyd of this His worthinesse as I it know and as the sayeng is. The Camell semes to me to be, a great out landishe beast Quod Herman to the printer then, that longe his peace had holde with bunches twaine vpon his backe, as highe as any horse atleast Of whiche I do remembre is in the newe Testament tolde That euery ryche gnof, may vp to heauen as easyly stye As maye this wilde vnruly beast, passe through a nidles eye. And eke we none in England haue excepte they bene vs brought Of late that I ne knowe, out of some farre countrye And by my trouth if I shall say you plainli to my thought Thoughe none we had, it skylles not muche, if they so vnruly by But prynter trust thou me, I nylle it not belieue A beaste to speake and writen this, my reason doth not giene. The prynter loude he loughe, and so dyd al the choppe And sayd that Herman spokene asmuch as myght be said But ware thee Camell here quod he, he would be in thy toppe No force quod he, of beastes I am nothinge afrayde Though I do selde on horse bake come, there can no Camell kynde. Tyll I knowe more, lette me to saye, thee fansies of my minde. Mary knowe thou then quod he, that Camell is a man. Nay printer softe quod wylkin tho and suffre me to speake what cause had hee that moued him, to auswere to this whan Or why shoulde he of other al, so fumysshlye out breake To barke at Dauye Dykers dreame that ment him none vnrest Excepte he ware one of those sortes, that wolde haue redrest Pardieu a Dreame is but a Dreame, a fansye of thee heade And hee ne ment I hope that men, sholde it for gospell take But as asweuen or fantasie, that eche one shulde it reade For thy me thynkes accordyngly, the name dyd Dauye make And nowe a man (ye saye he his) against a Dreame to spurne Me thynke it eyther smelles of craft, or els of somme harte burne. What soft, mate quod the prynter tho, and hee began to lowre You ginne ware hote I wene, against thee sommer sonne Ye may be cooled ere ye come home, with somme freshe Aprill showre This to muche before that I mytall haue all ydonne Here fyrst an ende of all, and then pronoucen dome Or els departe ye calmely hence euen suche way as ye comme. Herman was full wo, when he, thee prynter sawe thus wroth And had but lyttle lust to try out the tale And to his felowes gan vpbraide, ye se thee daye hence goeth And eke ye knowe aswel as I, the water gynnes to vale And by the vanes I spye the winde, to be by south at west That we vs haste to Maldon meade, I thinke it be the best. And therfore nowe giue vs quod he, and take thou here thy grote And though that wilkin and this wat, haue shewed theyr hasty wyt (We Maryneres be saltce y frete, we can no but god wote) I pray the prynter be content and take no grefe at it We haue at homme a mariner that can somme skyll of booke He shall them see and reade them vs, and so theyr leaue they toke. And I that present was at al, for that I lyked the sporte G? print it in mi fyckle heade in order as I coulde And for to pen it out the bed did to mycelfe resorte And drewe it there into a somme, as I had harde it tolde. Not withe suche wordes as they it spake, but in suche wordes as I. Had partly learned of my dame, and lyst to fantasy. Suche happe may happe, to giue a seconde fytte. If cause shall happe, and lay sure serue for it. Of such as on fantesye decree and discus: on other mens workes, lo Ouides tale thus. Rude Pan woulde nedes one day in companye Compare to mend Apolles melodye? And toke his homlye pipe and gan to blo The Ientil god, that saw his rudnes lo (Although him selfe knewe how for to excell) Contented stode, to here his conning well: Pan played, and played boystiouslye Apollo played but muche melodiously And suche a tune wyth suche musicke gaue As well became hys knowledge for to haue. Midas stode by to Iudge and to decre whiche of them both shoulde best in musycke be And as he herde Pan playe &amp; vse hys song, He thought it suche as he had liked long And wonted was to here of others oft Apolles harpe and song went very soft And swete and strange: as none might sweter be: But yet thought Midas this musycke lykes not me. And therfore strayght full loude he cried and said: Pan. to mine eares of both hath better plaied, Quoth then Apollo syns thus thou demest Pan: Me to excel that God of Connyng am, And so doest iudge of thinges thou canst not skyll Midas henceforth lo thus to the I wyll Thou shalte haue eares to shewe and tell I wys: But what thy skyll and what thy reason is. which on thy heade shal st?de and witnes be Howe thou haste iudged this rurall God and me Nay be contend for I haue it sayd A ful sad man stood Midas th? dismaide And as hee felt to trye if it so was He found hee had two eares as hath an Asse Newly growen out wher as hys own eares stoode Sor chaunged then his coullour and his mode But yet for thie, hauing no worde to say He shooke hys eares and sadly went hys waye I know no more, but thys I wot and know That tho the Phrigian kyng be buried lo And both hys eares eke with hym hydden be And so far worne that no man shall them se, Syns suche there are that lyue at this day yet Whiche haue hys skyl, hys iudgement and his wit And take vpon them both to iudge and know To them I wyshe euen thus and to no mo That as they haue hys iudgement and his yeares, Euen so I woulde they had his fayre longe eares.

Camelles Conclusion Camelles conclusion, and last farewell then, To Churchyarde and those, that defende his when. A man that hath mo thynges then two, to put him vnto prines, Hath euen so many cares the mo to worke hym wery braines. So I, that late haue laboured harde, and pulcked at my plowe, Am come to towne, where nowe I fynde mo matters then ynewe. Mo then I looked for by muche, mo matters to then needes, Mo makynges &amp; mo medlynges far, then I haue herbes or wedes. And all agaynst me one alone, a sory symple man, That toyles and trauailes for my foode, to earne it as I can. And gladly woulde in quiet bee, to swinke and liue in rest, But dreamers wyl not suffer me, they nettle so my nest. A surreioinder, dreamer bringes, the second a decree, A maryner bringes in his bote, and he the thirde wil be And so they ioyne and iompe in lease, god gra?t them well to runne. For I shall shewe them if I can, course er I haue done. The dreamer first full well I know, I shooke hym by the sleue, Whereat the other .ii. I trow, are angrye and do greue. But that no force be as be may, here gothe thee beast a broade Dreamer a wake, mariner rowe, decree man looke a broade. The beaste will turne I laye a grotte, and gyue you all a tryp, why nowe syrs nowe, nowe foote it well, this beast begyns to skyp. And fyrst to master dreamer turnes, and his surreioyndre to, wherin all thinges bee well he saith, that he doth dreame and doo. He dreames hee sayes and truly meanes, to put thinges in good stay Shorte syr Dreamer, a bandy ho, that baall muste nedes away. If that your dreame haue suche entent, that hath in an effecte, And that effeecte your western wyll would not haue men suspect: But take it as a Dreame sayes he, and fantesy of the head. A fyner freke by Roode then you, I haue his workes wel reade. Altho hee chop in chorles termes, and carpes in vncouth speeche, Yet knowe I with a fynger wet, where wyse men might hym seche, That if hee whyp his whyrryso, he may chance licke a clowne, To whyp it under water quite, and craire and cariag drowne. But s?s he is bec? my iudge and iudgeth me amysse, In nothing me quite oute of rule, as his wide wisedome is He shall well knowe, and so shall you, and the decreer too, that for my rule, when I was yonge, this was I taught to doo. My father put me firste to schole, where, I a maister hadde: Of whom I had preceptes and strypes as fitted for a ladde. He taught me there to feare my god, and loue hym with my mihht. To serue the king, and pray for hym, and all his counsell ryght. Then next to honour those my frendes, that kept me so at scoole. And this while I a scholar was, was euery day my rule. And syns that tyme, my vicar hath full lyke a christ? man, Taught mee to treade in godes high waie, and kepe it as I can. To be obedient to the kyng and to the lawe also. And doo my duetie to the powers, and lette their matters go. Que nostra sunt curare lo, he titled at my doore, And bad me printe it on my postes, an spread it on my flore. And leele loue &amp; labour eke, he had me learne to knowe, And kepe my plowe for profite sake, and thanke god to I trowe. And tolde me howe there hanges a bell, within our parishe churche, whiche he dothe tw?ge eche mornyng rathe, before we go to wurche, That toles to me, &amp; others mo, our neighbours there abut, This terme whiche I shall tel you nowe, as I can bring it out. que supra nos nihil ad nos, this bel tinges vs to kenne: And this hee said thee bell warnde me, as it dyd other men And when I sawe this Dicars when, I was so bolde to tell. That Dicar in his draffishe dreame, had not herd this bell well. And then for thy, forsooth and god my horne &amp; scrape I tooke: And scartched in a fewe fret lynes, for dreamers on to looke: And so syr thus I ment no more, but minded hym to know His duetie (as I ment myne owne) and father not to goe, Tyl in his toyes he tickled me, as lofty ladde on lowde And shope me shares to sharpe mee withe, to carpe out of a clowde. And if you rolle thus out of tune for raynyng hym this way, To kep h?selfe in ordersuch as he shoulde doo I faye: And take the iudgement to your hande, and terme me oute of rule, Then trowe me well, you me wid fr? Camel to a mule Whiche Camell can not trouch withal, nor cary with him home. But shape and shake it to yourselues, like lumpes of your owne lome, But wel away, I wander wide, for Churchyarde m?t it well, And so he saies, and so say you, and so your writynges tell, So sometymes houses fired are, by meanyng well in lyghtes, And then the meanyng is but marde, and they mad meaning wightes. But sens you wil nede haue me seke the meanyng of this whan, Meane it to those whom it dothe touche, and scuse it as you can And then let wyse men deme and iudge atwene Dicar and me, which of vs two is out of rule, I meane or I or hee. And fyrst let mee nowe are you all, what signifies this whan? That caries withe hym at his taile, so great a iarryng than. Holde is it in hand a present tymme, or future tymme to comme? Or is it admirantis worde, as schoole men call it some. It must needes meane a matter madde, as farre as I can see, But on go to, your wittes are fyne, meane you it out for me. Dreamer dothe dreame, and whens vs out, a wondre of these whens, wher of somme whens are wonders well, and mete for whens mens But some from gammuth gront and grone aboue ela a note: And those wilde whens at whend to large, I dare you gage my cote, what when is this, that he whens out, when iustice ioynes to truthe? whose seate is that? howe ioynes iustice? dreamer saie on in sooth. And nodde your noddles nowe in one, and make a trinitie. Ful worke manly to worke this when, if y? it wilso bee. And fyrst waye well what iustice is, to whom it dooth pertaine. Who swayes the swoorde, who dooth decree, looke to the matter pláin. From wh?s he coms, what branche he bears, and who and whiche him vse, And aunswere iustice to the wr?g, wher w? you h? accuse And meane your meanyng as you meane, and dreame not in your slepe, And shew what ioly ordere nowe, in this your when you kepe. But shorte to make of all your whens, to take thee principall, This is among the rest the worst, and standes thee last of all. when Rex dothe reigne and rule the roste, lo thus you raunge at laste A meruaillous when that suche a when, should out in print be paste. Dothe not Rex rainge sit dreamer now? what whennyng terme is this? If Rex reigne not? who reigneth then? a sauci when this is. And whend at length and large in deede, beyonde a subiecres wit, That god defende that I should dreame, or that, or lyke of it. And yet I trowe I haue a byll for cattall that I solde: That saies howe Rex hath raigeed vi. yeare almost I dare be bolde. And eyther is your when ful false, or my byl is not tru And which is truest of th? both, let me uow aske of you As for my selfe I make no doubtes, but that your wh? is wrong, And that Rex raignes as he hath doon, &amp; shall I trust raigne long. whiche as in scoole I was fyrst taught, to praie that he may doo. So euery subsecte let hym seke to haue that prayer to, Thus coulde I touch some other whens, wherin you when at large. A gret deale past your compasse to, and as muche paste your charge. But, those I leaue by lyght of this, for to bee scande and sene, To those that better iudgementes haue, then you or I, I wene. And nowe wyll take your then in hand wher with you knit your when. In publishing it thus to me and to al other menne. Than balefull barnes bee blithe you say, that here in England wonne: Our stryfe shall stynte you vndertake, our dredfull dayes are donne. An assurance her you make that baleful barnes we be, And that in strife we are also, &amp; dreadeful daies doo se. But God defende it should be true, which your ful frantycke hedde: Hath publysht to so op? eis for to be seene and redde. For once for me I make no doughtes, nor no good subect elles: But we a moble soueraign haue, as al our statuts tels. And as al orders els be?ds do wyll vs for to know: who gouernes vs and is our head, and rules vs also And vnder hym haue other powers to see that law be donne: To gree and tune vs in accorde, if wee be out of tune. Under whose rule &amp; order eke, al we that subiectes be: do liue and ioyne as sytteth vs, in one for to agree And in thee town where I do dwell, I know no stryfe or dread. But euery man there lyues in tune as subiectes to their head. And meddels not but with their plowes, and somtime with their bow. And prate with Peter and with Paule, theyr duties for to know. And learne so for to kepe them still, in order as they can: Except such wranglers wrangle them, withe suche large whan and than And so I truste they do elswhere, whiche for my part I pray, That l?ge we may so ioyne in one, what so your when dothe say But yet suche dreadfulle whans and thens, which doth the matter marre were bette quight, pulled out of syght, then shewed as they are. And so shewe westerne will from me, and wat and Herman too And will them wynde their talke well not as they wont to doo. For if they leane to learne suche whens, it will be l?ge I feare, Ere they will channell well theire craire, that shulde them safely beare Thomas Camell. Westerne will to Camell and for hym selfe alone, althoughe hee leudly lust, to knitte vp three in one When calmely blowes the winde, and seas but lytle moue, And cloude appereth none, to threaten from aboue Unwelcomme chaunge of wether, with rage of storms loude, Be mistes their manteles spreade, the sonne away to shroude, The Maister idle syttes, &amp; shipboyes stere thee sterne, The course so rarelesse is, he lust it not gouerne But when the storme beginnes, to rattle in the skyes And wallowing waues a loft, like mountaines high to ryse, And sources roul?g rounde, full thicke in others taile, Bethynde and eke before, the Crayer ginnes assaile, Then boyes comme fro the helme, and Maisters setto hande That better practise haue, the belowes to with stande. So now with me it fars syth ye begynne to blow, And thonndre in thee ayre, and sondrie lyghtnynges throw, And rore ageinst the rockes wher on your water beates My self to helme am comen to guyde her in these heats Suffised me a fore, when naught appered but calme To laughe and looke vpon the que?tise of your qualme As doeth the ydle man, vppon the plaiers game where parte hym self, hathe none and yeat vppon thee same His fansie commune wyll, and furtheto other telle what thing ther semed him good, or other wise then well But ye no lookers on, in no wyse can abyde To say their fansyes free, what toys in you they spied But eche muste haue his parte, when ye begyne to rage. Ye loue a nombre well, fo furnyshe out the stage And sithe ye will therfore, that niedes I shal come in, Thus for my self alone, to answer I beginne: A man that bendes hym selfe, to sowe thee sedes of payne No meruaylle thoughe hee reape, suche trauaile for his gaine. A wicked ploughe it is, that forowes vp a fielde To marre a pleasa?t patth and no goode fruite to yelde. who laboureth so to fynde with dygging in the mould Declareth well a wille, to fynde yf ought he coulde: And busieth hymself, with matters moe then niedes And roteth vp good herbes to plante in stynkynge wiedes. And yeat would counpted be, a sely symple man That nothing meanes but right, to further as he can And that ye myght him rue and pitiesome what more He makes as though he war, but one agaynst a skor And yet if all be weighed, in balaunce iust vpright, The chalenge restes in th?, that firste began the fight But that in diede I heare, ye haue the Beau Lugent. And eke that other one, that suche rewarde hath sent To him that went about, to stille you with decree As Phebus gaue to Pan, or iudgement like sayes he Lo here I bring my boate to rowe ye home to Lynne But ye suche c?science haue for punishement of synne That house and home may sincke, and oxen sterue at plow. But ye mai some what gete to carry home wit you woulde ye be glad in diede, to swincke and lyue in rest? Then haue ye much a wrye begonne to make your neste And that I trust at ones, in sobre woordes to showe, Bestirre ye now in beast, y? mariner ginnes to rowe, A personne of such witte, as ye would sieme to be Of such fore caste and zeale and of suche grauitie Before he taketh in hande, against a thing to wryte And sette the same abroche, to all the peoples sight Will weight what woords therin, bee not welle sayd or ment And eke howe farre the sam from dutie doe dissent which thing if ye so did, in reading of that bille Then founde ye all thinges well or some thing sounding yll But if you found them well ye raile and lacke a gro?de But if they siemed so ylle, as ye do make them sounde yle Then dutie claymeth this, and specially in you That in your youthe was taught, your dutie well enoughe To haue race it fro the post and whem ye warned had The seller, that this dream was da?gerous to be radd The same in sobre wise, to open vnto those That lawfull power haue our state, to binde and louse Of whome you th?kes had then deserued for your diede And taken away y? cause wher of more euil might bried But this thinge did ye not, wherfore I may conclude Yf any harme there be, by you the woorte was brued And ye concealed firste, the faulte ye dyd espie And iudged it matter mete, your wr?gling witts to trye Ye dreamed ye smelled a sparke, whiche thoughe it ware right smalle Ye could by blow?ges br?g, and tindre mirt withall To make a flambe right great, in syght of many a on which streight way of it self woulde ells haue quenched alone. But had the dreamer giuen the victory to you And holde his peace at first all had bene good enough: The purging of your galle and hongre of a cote As somme men do affirme, haue chauffed you so hote Yet if you so haue founde suche sparckles in this dreame Go blowe them where they bred, they be without my streame Although you argue thus, entente will haue effecte whiche westerne wil vould not, that any should suspecte wher to I answer thus, ye stomble in the plaine And wher ye thinck all sure your reas?s are most vaine Full lytle witte ye haue, if ye cannot espye this argument to be muche truer contrarrie For sieldomer entent, atteineth to effecte Then as ye folishelly, thee other do obiect. I bydde no man to take it as dreame or fantasie But ther I plainly shewed, that euen so tooke it I And nothing ells did mean in homely westerne wille But so to choppe in trenchour termes, as folkes do at the mill wher eche to other carpes in rude &amp; borrell spieche Of thinges wher with th?selues, do neither smarte ne itche, And if you would for this, we learned bothe to dyue My boate and I toguether god let ye neuer thryue But god bee thancked euer, that so for vs prouides More noble hartes &amp; wise, our com?welth that guyds. As he them list assigne, that reigneth in the toppe Our true redoubted kinge, of suche excellent hope As neuer subiectes had a paterne more expresse Of kingly vertues all, and learned noblenesse whose persons are to highe to, stowpe into this rythme and better nothing said, th? spoken out of time To you my pen I turne that iudgen me amysse, And praye you well to note the parkinge vp of this Sithe eye so well can racke, the mening of ones mynde And haue a grace to smelle, that fewe men elles would finde Content your self a while, and neither fume ne freate Though with your owne to you I doo like measure meate And sure I will not chuse the woorst emong the rost But take the woord wherin you sieme to triomphe most: Because ye woulde bee thought, to reuerence thee powers (As well becomes vs all, to all our gouernours) Suche name as they right well contented are to heare And suche as of it self a maiestie doth beare Contented are ye not, to vse in your verse But by the name of goddes ye do them oft reherse Now if you wille alleage the scripture vseth this According to your skille: Ego dixi dii estis Then harken I beseche your goddes howe they agree To him that wee call God, and one beleue to be, Lo in your rithmes afore, peruse them who that wyl, It well appearres, the Godes, whom you them liken till, ware neither goddes ne m? of cyuyle lyuing good But fansyes of ydolatres, &amp; dreames of Robinhood, But graunt that they ware goddes of olde gentilitie Yet muste we take them suche, as they them wryte to bee Then ponder well my fri?d sithe ye the latten knowe, what tales in them be tolde of Iupiter arowe, And what a worthi clue, ye wynd vp of this threade when ye thee magistrates, conioyne to such a heade: And here if I would bring, extent to haue effect I coulde make some beleue ye ware to be suspecte: Ye mean them honour least wher most ye do them glose And vse suche termes, as might be made a shipmans hose: I could ye heare paynt out, a rable of those Goddes Betwixst he whiche &amp; Magistrates, I trow ye should put oddes But that I do auoide, and feare also in diede, That people in my rithmes suche thinges vnfytt would riede I am not yet so bold, to talk at large of them whome alwayes I haue feared, if they but wink or hem But vse in you hathe bred, suche skylle bi sondry ch?ge That happen what so wyl, it sieldome semeth straunge wher practise small is had, in any kynde offeate To suche it often happes, that tryfile seme them greate But stomacke so are your, by trauaille in your trade with many a wandring course, from post to pyllour made That nothinge mountes so highe, ne semethe of suche, wayte That ye will not attempte if ones ye wynde the baite. Thus far I am content, to waste ye on the waye And as for all the rest, that you to other saye Let them the aunswer make to whome it apperteignes For I haue some what elles to occupye my braynes And for your lesson, lo by Christ I lyke it well And suche a lyke I wiene, doth Pierce the ploughman tell, But yeat leaue out this clause, to spreade it on thee floore It was enough to haue it written on the doore For if it comme so low, to lye vppon the grounde I feare that many fiete, will make it full vnsound And treade it all to durte, in sorte I you assure That ye may happe forgette to put the thinges in vre. W. Watreman. A plain and fynall confutation: of camelles corlyke oblatracion Ye vprighte men whiche loues thee light, whose heartes be voyd of gyle: Cond?ne no cause till trueth be tryed, giue eare and lyst a whyle. And marke my tale from point to point, let no worde skip vnskande: And heare them withe indiffrent eares, and way them as they stande. Fyrst lay aside affecci? blind for truethe my cause muste pleade, Let nether foe nor fained frend, this matter Iudge nor reade. And then I truste to clere myselfe, and Camell cleane confound: That blowes the trompet of defam, whiche geues vncertain sound. The tune wher of semes yet ful straunge, so boistrous is the blast: But quiet calmes settes forth stil windes, when stormes begon and past. Whiche quyet time I wish to haue, that I may be well harde. And th? I hope this vypars bryde, shall haue his iust rewarde. That forgeth fautes and seeketh holes, to crepe and scale therin: And flattereth for no other cause but fame or gayne to winne. What thinkes this man he hath more witte, &amp; learning in his head. Than hathe fyue thousand other men, that (Dicarres dreame hath read. Or thinkes hee that I am so rashe, to run so far fr? square Or that I make such obcure thinges, that I dare not declare. Than is hee blynde and veryfond, and scarce him selfe doeth know. Let him loke on his booke againe, his rule is nothinge so. To you I speake fr?d Camel now, which wreketh ryght to wrong: You saye you haue ben kept at scole, in soothe I thinke not longe. Your master dyd but stroke your head, he dyd for beare the rodde: I dout he dyd not teache you well, howe you should feare your God. For if hee had you woulde haue stayed, to wryte against this dreame: To spye a mote within my eie, since in yours is a beame Yf you might site and iudge my cause, I shoulde soone feele your worst: But God forbyd there were long hornes, on beastes that would be corst. I call you beaste because you sayde, here goeth the beast abrode: Thee beaste will turne you gage a grote, yf he be prickte with goade. Nowe turne syr beaste and come aloft, fling not for fear of whip: In dede it is a monstruse thynge, to see a Camelle skipe. You say you shoke me by the sleue, than rubde I your gall packe: Yf I know howe to doo you good my healpe you should not lacke. We I ompe in leasse, ye gab fyre beaste, I am but one alone: But I can proue (O beavv Camevv) that you are moe then on. My surreioyndrer doethe declrare, this dreame was for the best: And yet you crye, abandye ho at tenues thus ye ieste. What can you laye vnto my charge, of malyce or of hate: Since I do wyshe that euery wyght, shulde walke in his estate. This veerse you hyppe, and yet it standes, next that wh? rex doeth rayng: Bothe these be good and godlye to, here shall I showe you plaine. But as I sayde, out of faire flours, thee spyder poyson takes: And yet the bee doeth feede theron, and ther with hony makes I do compare this spyder nowe, to you whiche so apperes. For that you run a patheles waye, to leade me in thee breerres. Wheare fynde you this that dreames can haue, any effect at all. Be not they fancyes of thee hed and so wyse men th? call why do you wryte against a dreme, whiche hath a small effect, why turne you yt to meanyng leawde, to bringe it in suspect, You ment no more but mee to learne, so you woolde you excuse: Syr yf you mynde to kepe a frynde, do not your frinde so vse. You bragge you of your master much when you to skool dyd goe: You sayde ye larned your duetie well good syr it seems not soe. To serue the king and praye for hym, I learnede as well as you: To loue hym leall for concyens sake this lesson well I knew. His councell ecke for to obay my dueti learnes me too: And withe ther matters not to mell, nor therin haue to do. This lesson heether to I kept, and shall here after kepe: Tylle I to earthe retorne again, where fleshe and fell must sleepe What is thee cause you answerde not, to that whiche I wrott last: You do conclude muche lyke a thefe, whiche is cond?nde and cast. For at the barre hee pratethe long, &amp; can no reason shewe: To clere hym selfe and saue his lyfe whan trueth doeth hym orethrow. So you all thoughe withe matter now, I do you styll assault: Yet withe great shame you are content, to yelde vnto your fault. I wrate more thinges than one or two, yet reade them ons agayn: I do perceiue a littell thing, wille soone orecomme your braine. You haue sought councell fourteen daies, it seems that you dyd dreame: Or els ye thought to rune awaye, into somme other realme. But now I heare a sodayn sounde, the beast begyns to braye: It is muche like a Camells voyce, that dwelles in lyn they saye. Be as be may you say your selfe, ye byd me foet it well, why will the beast now lead the daunce, with beastes I will not mell. But wheare yon saye, I wh? out whens, aboue eala a note, You gront and groen from gammuth farre, I dare you gage my cott. Sins you will put me to my trompe, with a false carde often, Marke howe iustice shall ioyn to trueth, I will make large this when. Note Though iustice doeth bel?ge to Rex, whose swoord puts that in vre, Yet euery iustice vnder him is not so iust and pure. Because there bee knightes of the post, whiche will them selues forswere, And fained trueth will forge a tale, sometimes in iustice eare. And worke such wils, iustice to blynde, and make him credit lyes. Suche crafty mistes these men can cast, before true iustice eies. Thoughe iustice of him selfe is pure and cleane deuoide of crime, Yet falce witnes may alter him, and chaunge his minde somtime. Thee faut ther of is not in hym, he woulde fayn ioyn to truthe. But flatteryng faith, may him corrupt, alas the more is ruthe. Whan truthe is forman of the quest, and right shall vardyt gyue, Than iustice shall ioyn styll to truethe, &amp; so together liue. Thus is this when made manifeste, truely as I it m?t And yet it was ful plain before, to euery true entent. Here haue I waide what iustice is, to whome it dothe pertain, who swaies the sworde, who dothe decree, heare haue I set out plain. Now staye a whil, &amp; marke this when, whiche you calle principall, And is y? beaste amonge the rest and, st?deth last of all Note when rex doth reign (And) rule the rost, a coniuetion copulatiue, Your master taught you not to know, could he such th?gs discriue? Now Rex doth rayne whom god preserue, in long life on vs here, And sende him rule the rost himselfe, as prince withouten per. That he may fynde those secrete flighes, whiche nowe in corners lye: And suche as do abuse his lawes and liue so wickedlye. It semes they lyue as they delyght, and leane not to his lore, Bycause he doth commende them lawes and they passe not therfore. Howe dothe the master of the scole, his scollers rule and tame: whan he doth geue precepts and rules, and none doth kepe the same. How doeth y? kyng his peopl rule, let this be better waide whan hee dothe geue them lawes and actes and none of them obeyde. For thoughe y? Rex do rayne and rule, as I beleue in dede Yet dothe not hee for mercye greate, y? wicked al out wede And lyk as God is mercyful so doeth our kyng in dede: Enswe and folowe in his steppes, (whom God defend and spede.) His Iustice is to punish sine with death &amp; payne extreme; which is most godly exercisd and so doeth shewe and seme Yet yf al those that do off?de, should haue such punishem?t what man is liuinge nowe a dayes, that shoulde escape vnshente? But folowyng the example of, the Lorde and kynge of kynges: Dothe often suffer vs vnkinde, in vyle and greuous thinges. Becaus he would (as it doth seme, so mercifull and dere:) Bee rather loue th? obeyed or only dreade and feare. And this hys mercye godly mente, dooth make vs worse in dede: As scollers when they lacke the rodde, do lyue withouten drede. But when he shall begynne again, to punish wyckednes: whiche is his iustice (or more playne,) to vs but ryghtousnes. Then folk for feare (but not for loue,) shall better ende theyr life As horses whipt, ye then for feare shall stynte and cease our strife. wherfore yf euery kynge this daye whiche oughte in dede to raingne: Do raygne and rule the rost and weede, the wicked oute ful plaine. Then haue they welth with out? stryfe, which God geue vs ryght sone: That all oure wyckednes were paste, and dredfull dayes were done. If Dycar sayde, when Rex doth rayne, &amp; al m? doe obey How could you Camel, thus conclude? he raygneth not to daye. Note Or if he sayd, when Christ is God, and you a faythfull mam: would ye conclude? ergo, (to him,) he is not God now th? wherfor yf Rex do raygne &amp; rule, as I beleue he doeth: And I beseche almyghtye god, he maye do l?ge in sothe Yet muste you take another poynt, conteined in this wh? when Rex dothe raygne and rule the rost, and wedes oute wyked men. You muste not harken halfe the tale an leaue thee reste behynde: for than in dede you do amysse, and fayne woulde quareles fynde You Redde in faythe muche like the nunne omnia probate And turned not thee other syde quod bonum est tenete. Redde you no more but Rex doeth raygne, and lefte the reste vnspyed: Is there not to) and rule the roste, the sentences is so tyde. And wede oute wiked wordly men, thee spotted from the cleane: whose vyce infectes the chosen lambes, lo thus dyd Dicar meane. He doubted not but Rex doethe roigne, the truethe it selfe doethe showe: But yet he th?ghte it good to wede, oute wycked men I trowe. And thus I say dyd Dicar dreame, thee sence doethe plainly tell Yf vpryght eies and rihteo? mindes, do loke and skan him well. If you shulde bee my iudge I se, and deme my dreminge thus I shulde haue but short, curtesy, and you my cause discus, But god hath sawed your hornes so short, no great hurt do you can Hee made you nether lorde nor iudge, nor skarse an honest man, whan Rex doth raigne and rule the rost, and out thee wicked weede, Than you and many other lyke, would fyrst of al preced But where you set a snare and net, for these that well entende. To showe what is the very cause, of euill and the ende. There you yourself (and if it were, applied wel in fram As he hath ment) shulde certainly be catchid in the same what if I shulde cast furth the bone, you thoughte to choke me with: Perhappes you may repent to late, you went so nie y? pyth Wher is your lesson now be come, you lernd so long ago, That spide suche faute in dicars dreme, and yet conceilde it so. Note If it had raught to Iupiters seate as you affirme in dede You ought not it haue kept so long, but straight it told with spede. Or if you thought you saw the myst, that no man elles coulde skrye, There shulde no cause haue stopte you so, to tel it by &amp; by If dicars when, as true it is he clere from blame &amp; blotte Yet your off?c is no whit less by caus you thought it not. If ignoraunce had sayd a mysse, y? same be my defence, Yet wilful ignora?c in you, dothe pleade your great offence. Behold of god y? rightuouse scourdge, that now amydde the gryn: You layde to trappe the innoc?t your selfe is fall? ther? What say you nowe wise camelles caulse, if rex wede wicked men, You shuld of right be tide to short, to peruerte dicars wh? But tyll suche spyders bee wede out, and all theyr cob webes to, That sekes to trappe the sellye flies, as you begyn to do. The barnes I say that here do wonne, with in this brittaine lande, Shall byde alas those dred full daies, and dicars dreme may stande. O Syr you toke my thenin hand, wher w? mi wh? I knit where I perceiue your franityke head, begins, another fyt. Note Can you denie the plages of god, whiche he to vs hath sent? And scourgeth vs for our great sinnes, from which we not repent. Doeth not thee plowe man plowe his grownde, and laborith vereisor. The earth bringes forthe his fruite like wyse, encreasyng more and more Doeth not the heauens gyue vs rayne, the watters gyues vs fyshe? Doeth not the counsell seeke oure welth, as well as we can wishe? Do not they take great care &amp; payne, all euells to redresse Yes all these thinges doe worke as well, as mans t?g can expresse. Yet though oure kinge do make good lawes, the earth bringes forth muche sede: Tust gracious God of hys goodnes, will helpe oure miserie within thee towne wheare you doe dwell, you know no dred nor strife: Than is it sure a paradise, I laye theron my lyfe. For I haue traueld here and theare, &amp; sought this world well wide: to fynde a resting quyet place where I would fain abyde. But in this wery pilgrimag I neuer found suche stay: Nor suche a vertuous towne as Lin, yf it be as you saye Yf you haue done as muche in Line, as you in L?d? haue I thinke that al your neighbours woulde, sone wyshe you in your graue. For we were here in quyet al vntyll you came to towne: Sence that we could not lyue in reast, for suche a contrey clowne. And Dauie Dicars Dreme forsooth, was lowed of euery man: Tyll you began youre wranglyng reimes, to brall vpon his whan. Wherin you lost your honest name, you could not lose muche more: Thus are you put to open shame, and haue no thanke therfore. Go showe your co?cell on by on what gain you here haue got: Ad hereto vvatHerman wil helpe to rowe you hom, good syr nowe take your botte. Nowe trudge a waye feare gentill beast, and kycke no more at me: And let them lyue in peace and rest, that thinkes no harme to the. Thus here I take my leaue from you, wishing for grace and healthe: To kepe my prince from all his foes, &amp; eke y? c?un wealth Camelles crosse rowe. Doth playne y showe, Wythouten lyes or gyle: His foolyshe feattes, With raging freates, The truthe for to reuyle. A wycked man doth set his minde, his heart, &amp; hole intent, To sclaunder truthe, &amp; godlynesse, and hurt the innoc?t. But blessed be all those that be so falsly lyed apon: And pacyently do suffre it, whome God dothe helpe eche one. Catche no m? in his words to sooke, but reade for better minde. For so the Ieswes pursued Christe, some tryp with him to fynde. Discencion, discorde, variaunce, &amp; those y? make debate, The Lord that loueth vniti, dothe sore detest and hate. Embrace &amp; loue your enemi Chryst byddeth very plaine: How can you so? whan you for loue do r?dre hate again Forsake your forged lyes. &amp; turne your flattery to truth: And leaue in age the wyckednesse that you had in your youthe. God gyueth all the gyftes, to man, the whiche be good and pure: For of our selfe we haue nothyng but euell, I am sure. Haue no delyte, the gyltes of God, so wyckedly to vse, To sla?der good &amp; vertuo? thynges: I c?not you excuse I praye to God the Lord of myght, y? eueri wycked tongo Myght ones by roote be weded out his people fr? a m?g Knowe well before you knit your knot, the meaning, and the ende: And learne, at thinges of Godlynesse, your wycked lyfe to mende. Lyke as thee Horse dothe wynse whan he is rubbed on the gall: So wicked do at godlye th?gs, to m?d their lyf, withal Moche euel comes by those that wold mayntaine all wyckednesse, And eke peruert instruction good, &amp; sclaunder godlinesse No man can serue two masters wel &amp; please th? am wis Ye cannot serue our master Christe, &amp; flatter forging lies.
