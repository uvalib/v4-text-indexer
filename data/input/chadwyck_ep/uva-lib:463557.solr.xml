      <field name="fulltext">TO MY WORTHY AND iudicious Friend, Sir Francis Ducket Knight; his best wishes. So many kinde respects haue I had showne From You and Yours, that if you were mine owne As You are mine; for what can be more neere, Then Loue and Blood contracted in one Spheere? I could not prize Loue at a higher rate, Nor to my selfe more kindnesse vendicate: In lieu whereof, (but 'lasse th' requitall's small) I tender you this Spring, and this is all: Wherein, if ought tune fitly with the Time, I'ue stil'd it Yours, it shall no more be mine. Yours in all respectiue loue Mvsophilvs. Vpon the New Spring. A New Spring's found which cureth most diseases; It cleeres the Eye-sight, and the Bladder eases, It cooles the Stomacke, and it cheeres the Heart, And giues free passage to th'digestiue part, It recombines the Sinnewes too, some say, And makes the Cripple throw his Crutch away. So as there's none that iustly can complaine them, Since both a Sir Edward Bellingam, a Knight of extended bounty and curtesie. Knight and's Spring doe entertaine them. Hee, out of Loue and Bounty mixt together, It by it's Vertue healing such come thither. O that the Reader could like Vertue finde In my New Spring, to cure the griefes of Minde, But much I feare me, if it had like force, The Bodies care would make my Spring tast worse. A NEVV SPRING. Philo to Philemon. Non Vltra. Each day and houre (my friend) that shines on thee Esteeme it as thy Liues Epitome; Nor need I by a Precept further show it, Since 'tis so well aduis'd vs by the Poet: “'Mongst hopes, cares, feares, and all the griefes thou hast, “Imagine euery day to bee thy last: So shall the sight of each approaching Day Summon thee hence that thou may hast away: Meane while contend in vertue and in grace, Hastning to th'end of this thy Pilgrims race, This Weauers Shuttle, Grasse, Post, Shadow, Span, So short's the course, so small's the time of Man. Mans securitie, the Diuells opportunitie. Man thinks the shade of Night can couer sin, But Night and Day be all alike to Him, Whose eyes as they are piercing, so they be Pure, and doe loath the least impiety. Morall. How oft haue I (O Lord) erred in this, Thinking thee blinde when Night approched is; Where if I rightly did distinguish light, I'de thinke Mans Day farre darker then thy Night: For there's no Night with Thee; but such a Day, As needs no Sun to chase the Night away. Annotation vpon the precedent Morall. It is obserued by the Learned, that Adam after his fall or defection from God, seeing his owne nakednesse which hee procured to himselfe by his owne disobedience, being borne in a Primitiue freedome of will, to haue fled for refuge, or couert rather, to a shadie Groue in the Garden, imagining to exempt himselfe from the punishment due to his Sin, by flying to the shade to couer his Sin; implying (say they) that Man no sooner erreth, then hee seeketh some sconce, some defence for the sinne which he commiteth. But hee that rewardeth in publike, discusseth the secrets of our hearts in priuate: The Night is to him as the Day, for hee seeth not as Man seeth; hee that securely pretendeth darkenesse for a couert to his sin, and in the presumption of his owne security expostulates with his Creator, saying, Who seeth me? shall receiue his reward in the Land of Darknesse; for the secrecie of his sinne cannot auoid the piercing and searching eye of the Lord. Let him therefore stand in feare of Gods Iudgement both in the Morning and Euening, that he may shun the Arrow that flyeth at the noone-day, and the Pestilence that killeth in the Euening. A Diuine Embleme. Nosce et tace. Tu te time si viues tute. Thou Better part of Man: the inward Eye, Extended farre boue sense; how should the path (Erring and straying from Humanity) Haue guidance but by thee? where each Man hath A natiue pronenesse to Obliquity, Subiecting Reason to vnbounded wrath, Reaching as high by's Eye, as by his Faith. Where Truth lyes hid, curb'd by iniurious time, As in a Caue obscur'd: til th'glorious Sun Disperse this mist of Error by his shine, Discouering that which was in darknesse done: Still cheerefull be that faire Aspect of thine By whose refulgent beames such acts be showne As but for thee (Deere Light) had nere bin knowne. Age, which in some is as a Tale that's told, Wherein we rather be then seeme to liue, Tells me that it's not many yeeres make old; But houres how well dispos'd, since we must giue Accompt for euery Talent which we hold; And though the Lord seeme this accompt to driue: Time will approach when there is no repriue. Then may my number be in houres, not yeares, How good, and not how many, liu'd, not spent; VVhere may my Sinnes force sighs, my Errors teares, Liuing on Earth, yet leauing Earths content To Earthly-minded Moles, who sum their Feares By losse of goods, and giue no free assent To ought, saue what is to their profit ment. My Eyes not fixt but mouing in their Spheare, Transcend fraile Objects, nor can they behold Ought worthy louing or affecting heere, Where best of Natures treasures is but mold; Which in the Worlds eye how faire so ere, They shew their gawdie lustre is but gold, Which when the Mizer has is onely told. Let me haue Riches inward; for the rinde Of Earths exterior Beauty, my desire Rests well contented, howsoere I finde: And further should our soule-rapt thoughts aspire Then to content the Body; for the Minde, As in her ranke of honour she is higher, Shee scornes (pure Mirror) to be soild with mire. How hard is't to be good, and not decline From that small share of goodnes, where the Age In which we liue, bids vs to suite the time And make no mention of a Pilgrimage? It's true indeed, we seldome see the prime, Of Vertue made continuate; for the Page Which lackies Patience oft ends with rage. Hee liues the best who hath the least account, Accounting euery day to be his last: That when he comes vnto his finall poynt, To make recourse vnto the yeares be past, And sees to what the Totall summe doth mount: He may reioyce, t'haue made so little wast Of precious Time, while he on Earth was plast. How eft offend we? and as rockt asleepe Secure of ludgement, in the bed of Sin Lie we as men exempt from vengeance, Sheepe Straid from their Shepheard, which hath euer bin So kinde t'his Flocke, as he hath sought to keepe Them safe by his owne harme; yet leaue we him, Pursuing th' path of error we are in. If there be Hell, why doe we liue on earth As if there were none? yea, if common sense Tells vs a Pilgrimage hath no true mirth; Where this day we are heere, next calls vs hence: Why liue we heere as if we nere should forth From this vast Grate of griefe? our residence Is short on Earth; then let vs hasten hence. Th' vnseemliest Obiect Mans eye can behold Is Age attended on by nought but yeeres; Where his gray-hayres may tell vs he is old, But there's no other signe of Age appeares: Wherefore his Age seemes as a Tale that's told, His life a Medley of desires and feares, Desire of life to welcome Death with teares. What is this curious modell Man? whose shape Diuinely featured includes all faire In Him as in her Abstract, but an Ape, That imitates all formes, in habite, haire, Carriage of Body, and whats'ere may make His vanity admir'd, now heere now there Distasting most the tast of's Country ayre. If Man consist of Body and of Soule, And that the being of the first relies Vpon the latter; why should it controule The first by which it liues? or why despise, Or striue to make her chiefest Beauty foule With her seducing trifling vanities, Which presse the Soule so low it cannot rise? That Know thy selfe, deriued her first birth And Pettigree from Heauen, and did appeare On Earth to make it seeme an heauenly Earth; But see what chanc'd: Men so besotted were, Of their defectiue Knowledge, as a dearth Fell amongst humble men, learning to erre And fall by Pride, as did that a Lucifer. O let vs then confesse, (as well wee may) Our Knowledge it is nothing; and the good That's in vs is not ours; nor can we say Ought proper ours saue Sin, so rank's the blood Of our corrupted Nature: where each day Paints out our frailety, which if vnderstood, Man has no cause at all for to be proud. If euery Euen were as it ought to be, It should keepe count of all the day that's past; Asking our sin-surcharged soule, what she Hath done? which reckning should be neuer rac't Out of the Table of our Memory: But haue it so, o're all our actions plac't, That th' forme we haue may neuer be defac'd. If every houre we spend must beare record When we shall summon'd be; how carefull should Man be of euery worke, and euery word, Done, to be done, or spoke? for how shall mould, Clay, and corruption stand against the Lord? On whom wee all are truely said to hold: Seeing the crimes we act so manifold. Where each Mans Conscience shall his Tophet be, His Sinnes his Testates, and his last farewell To Earth, his entrance into misery: Where his owne Soule appeares his onely Hell, Th'Companions that attends him, doubts and feares, Mouing Despaire to sound her larum Bell, To warne him to the place where he must dwell. Mansion of horror, where the quenchles fire Burns without ceasing, where the gnawing worme Eates without resting, and that wofull hire Death neuer dead, though dying; where the forme Of all confusion formeth her retire; Thrice happy he if he had neere beene borne That's markt to come to such a place forlorne. No Life but shade of Life; for what is Life, But a continuall Death, wherein we die Each day a little? where dissention, strife, Restlesse Ambition, Treason, Periury, Oppression, violence bee onely rife: Where outward obiects daze the inward eye, And ill's made good by sinnes impunity. Liue may I neither to my selfe nor Time, Since Time-obseruers now proue Parasites; But to make streight that great accompt of mine, After so many dayes, so many nights, Past in neglect: so may my Soule in fine Possesse (then happy she) those pure delights Which doe include of comforts infinites. Muse doe I much when I doe heare men call (Whether Experience tell them, or their Art) Some yeares more safe, some Climactericall; Where if we looke into our humane part: In houres, dayes, yeeres, we shall perceiue how all Summon alike Deaths parley to our heart; From whom to get we striue, but cannot start. I haue long sought that Essence of my being, A faithfull friend; and I, haue found in Some, A veine of protestation well agreeing With Friend, if Christian, but when I should come To take a surer triall, he was fleeing, Prouing a Summer Swallow; this's my doome My friend's in Heauen, on Earth he has no roome. When I obserue Earth's as a Ball in th' ayre, I askt my selfe what may I seeme to be, That liues as if I had my Mansion there, Planting my hopes on mutability? And I doe finde who otherwise liues heere Then as a forraigne Trauellor though hee Seeme wise to some, hee seemes a foole to me. This House I liue in, like a shaking frame Threatens each day a fall; yet I secure Where I must goe to, or from whence I came Liue so, as if this Building would endure, And to eternity extend her name: But 'lasse how weake am I, seeming most sure, While sin wounds deepe and doth despaire of cure. Some, farre lesse wise then curious, doe delight To glaze their windowes with Perspectiue glasse, Presenting sundry obiects to the sight, As Hils, Dales, Seas, and whatsoere shall passe Within an equall distance: but the light Which the Bay-windore of my Mansion has, Hath no such various Prospect, though it might, But opens wide that she may see what's right. May Goodnesse be the Abstract of my Fayre, My best aduice, Direction of the word: May Worlds-care be still my least of care, May my Selfe-loue be now to loue the Lord: May I obserue a time to spend, to spare, Not taking thought to waste, or how to hoard, But in expence to keepe me on euen board. Rich had I rather then accounted be, Sayes the Worldling: But I am not of his minde; For my Account is dearer vnto me Then this same Barke of man, this outward rinde; Yet Rich are men of most account we see; It's true indeed, wee by experience finde, Oft goes the Cart before, the Horse behinde. Arise to iudgement, is a doome of feare To Flesh; for why shee could contented be To build her selfe a Tabernacle heere, Liuing to bee her owne posterity; But th'Soule mounts vpward to an higher Sphere Striuing to breake from her captiuity. Nor can shee ioy till shee's at liberty. Her Nunc dimittis, is her cheerefulst Song, Her passage th'entrance to a safe repose, Her comfort this, (though her restraint was long) Griefes past be counterpoiz'd with present ioyes. Her hope that she shall make her party strong, Being both rid of her perfidious foes, And sphered there where sacred comfort flowes. In our first Birth we shrike, in death we sigh, Thus discontent is Man, in birth and death; In Birth we shrike because affliction's nigh, In Death we sigh, sigh, sith wee cannot breath: Thus both in Death and Birth there's misery; And more in Death then Birth, if so his wreath Of glory be reduc'd to wrath beneath. An Elegie which the Author entituleth Bound yet free; Speaking of the benefit of imprisonment. Thou, whom we call lifes death, Captiuity, Yet canst contemplate in the darkest Cell Of things aboue the reach of Vanitie, Dost in my iudgement Liberty excell; In that thou teachest man to mortifie His indisposed passions; and canst well Direct him how to mannage his estate, Confin'd to th'narrow prospect of thy Grate. Hee sees the passage of this Globe of earth, And makes right vse of what his sight partakes: Some he obserues expresse a kinde of mirth, Of which he this due application makes; If they did know the misery of Birth With Deaths approach, they would not hazard stakes Of Soules eternall glory, for a day Of present ioy, which one houre takes away. Others he heares bemoning of the losse Of some deare friend; or't may be not so well, Decrease of fortune, or some other crosse, Which to forgoe they deeme a second hell, (So firmely fixed be their mindes on drosse) As nought smels well but what of gaine doth smell. These he condemnes, and proues it euery way, The captiu'st wretch's in better state then they. Others he notes obseruing of the time, Meere Fashion-mongers, shadowes of the great; And these attendance giue where th'Sunne doth shine, And like to Isis Asse admire the Seat, More then the Person, 'cause the robes be fine That hang about it: and hee doth intreat Their absence; for, These cannot well (saith hee) By liuing, leaue name to posteritie. Others as base and farre more dangerous, Notes he, as Politician Machauels, Who count that gaine which is commodious Adhering to themselues, and to none els: For these make ancient houses ruinous, And Charitie from out the Realme expels, Reducing th'Orphans teare and Widdowes curse To th' damn'd Elixie of their well-cramm'd purse. Others he notes, and they would noted be; For painting, purfling, smoothing, cerusing, Shew they would be obseru'd for vanitie, Staruing their Soules by bodies cherishing. And these hee laughes at for their foolery; For while they put the Case to garnishing, That Shell of frailty, they're indifferent What shall become of th'Soule the Instrument. Others there be which seeme least what they are, Pretending truth in falshood, and doe gull The World with shadow, yet doth he compare the passage of euents, and finds at full Their end's attended with an endlesse care, And th'pregnant wit which seemes so smooth proues dull, When thousand Testates shall produced be, For to disclose their close hypocrisie. Others hee sees and taxeth, for they hold proportion with the World, being made After a better Image, yet they'r sold to all collusion, making in their trade This vilde Position: Who'll be rich when old must cheat being young: but see how they'r displaid, So oft haue they deceiu'd as now they must, Perforce deceiue themselues by mens distrust. Others as Prollers of the time he sees, but scornes to take acquaintance; for their sate Presageth worst of ills, whose best increase proceeds from good mens falls: yet mark their state As indirectly got, so little peace accrewes in state to any, for the hate Of God and man attends them; and how then Should there be peace wher's war with God &amp; Men? More hee beholds, and hee obserues them too, and numbers their dimensions as they passe The compasse of his Prospect too and fro, for this same Grate he makes his Looking-glasse, In which he sees more then the world can show, conferring what is present with what was; Extracting this from times experienc't Schoole, The Captiue's freer then the Worlds foole. For by the first we shew but what we are, and Moralize our selues in being pent Close from the Worlds eye, which we compare Vnto a Prison, since th'enfranchisement We haue's in Heauen: then howsoere we fare, though bound, if free in minde, th'imprisonment We suffer, cannot so our spirits depresse, That th'freedome of our minds should seeme ought lesse: Ought lesse; nay more! for we approue as true What th'deuine Morall taught: That one may haue A fuller and more perfect enteruiew of the Starres beauty in a hollow Caue, Then on the Superficies; for the shew of pompe distracts our passions, and doth slaue Our reason to our sense; whence we may know, The dangers of high states are seene below. Below; and what more low then to be shut from open ayre, strang'd from the sight of Men, Clos'd in obliuion, linked hand and foot least their escape gaine liberty? what then Shall this enthrall my soule? it cannot doo't, it does aspire aboue the thoughts of them Who shed their Childish teares when they are sent By higher powers to take them to restraint. The truth of things, (saith sage Democritus) lies hid in certaine Caues, that is, the Cell Of Thraldome which restraines and limits vs, which makes vs happy if we vse it well; For we're sequestred from th'pernicious obiects of earth, and may in priuate tell, What we in publike were, where we doe finde, The freest man may haue the slauish'st minde. For my experience tells me th' Act of Sin, proceeds from sinnes occasion, which restrain'd, To meditate soules freedome we begin, and flie from earth when th'Body is enchain'd, Making our thoughts contemplators of Him, whom if we get we haue sufficient gain'd: So as the Grate of our Captiuity, Is th' Gate that opens to soules liberty. Whence 'tis wee see so many tast the ayre of freedome, with neglect of what they are; Making their will their Law; but when they share their portion in affliction, then their care Is in the honour of that inward faire, and they lament the state wherein they were: For Man in state forgets himselfe and his, Till his Affliction tells him what he is. If life indeed were such a Iubile, that euery houre, day, yeare, did promise vs Continuate health, and wealth, and liberty, then had we better reason to excuse The loue we haue to our mortality: but since wee see we cannot will nor choose, But must be reft of these, why should we grieue, To leaue as men what men are forc'd to leaue? Nor skills it much where we be reft of these, whether in Thrall or Freedome, but of th'two I'de rather lose my fortune where I cease, to make resort to any, and must know No more of th' World or the Worlds prease; but am retired from the publike show Of this fraile Theatre; and am confin'd In Flesh to tast true liberty of Minde. A Minde as free as is the Body thrall, transcendent in her being, taking th' Wings Of th' Morning to ascend, and make that all of hers immortall, sphearing it with Kings; Whose glory is so firme it cannot fall: where euery Saint in their reposure sings Th' triumphant Pæan of eternity, To Him whose sight giues perfect Liberty. Then whether my restraint enforce or no, Ile be my selfe, but more in my restraint; Because through it I see the end of woe, tasting in griefe the Essence of content: That when from this same double-ward I goe, this same entangled Prison; th' continent Of heauenly Freedome may receiue my Soule, Which Flesh imprison might, but not controule. Rest then (Retired Muse) and be thy owne, though all thy owne forsake thee, that when Friends, Fortune and Freedome are but small or none, thy hopes may ayme at more transcendent ends; So by the Body in strait durance throwne thy vnconfined Soule may make amends, For that which she had in her Freedome lost, In that most blest wherein she seemd most crost. The Statue of Agathocles. The Argument. Agathocles, a Tyrant of Syracusa, caused his Statue to be composed in this manner: The Head of Gold, Armes of Iuorie, and other of the lineaments of purest Brasse; but the Feet of Earth: intimating of what weake and infirme subsistence this little-World Man was builded. Whence wee may collect what diuine considerations the Pagans themselues obserued and vsually applyed to rectifie their morall life; where instructions of Nature directed them not onely in the course of humane society; but euen in Principles aboue the reach and pitch of Nature; as may appeare in many Philosophicall Axioms, and diuinely-inserted sentences in the Workes of Plato, Plutarch, Socrates, and amongst the Latines, in the inimitable Labours of Seneca, Boæthius, Tacitus and Plinius secundus. Vpon the Morall of this Statue of Agathocles, insists the Author in this Poem, concluding with this vndoubted Position: that as foundations on sand are by euery tempest shaken; so Man standing on feet of Earth, hath no firmer foundation then mutability to ground on. The Poem. Agathocles, me thinks, I might compare thee, (So rare thou art) to some choyce Statuarie, Who doth pourtray with Pencill he doth take, Himselfe to th'Image which hee's wont to make. How artfull Thou, and gracefull to by birth, A King, yet showes that thou art made of earth; Not glorying in thy greatnesse, but would seeme Made of the same mould other men haue beene: A Head of Gold, as thou art chiefe of Men, So chiefe of Mettalls make thy Diadem; Victorious Armes of purest Iuorie, Which intimates the perions purity; The other Lineaments compos'd of Brasse, Implies th'vndanted strength whereof thou was: But Feete of Earth, show th'grownd on which we stand, That we're cast downe in turning of a hand. Of which, that we may make the better vse, Me thinks I could dilate the Morall thus: Man made of Earth no surer footing can Presume vpon then Earth, from which he came, Where firmenesse is infirmenesse, and the stay On which hee builds his strongest hopes, is Clay: And yet how strangely confident he growes, In Heauen-confronting boldnesse, and in showes Bearing a Gyants Spirit, when in length, Height, bredth, and pitch he is of Pigmies strength: Yea, I haue knowne a very Dwarfe in sight, Conceit himselfe a Pyramis in height, Ietting so stately, as it were in's power To mount aloft vnto the ayery Tower. But when Man's proud, I should esteem't more meet, Not to presume on's strength, but looke on's feete, Which Nature, we obserue, hath taught the Swan, And ought in reason to be done by Man. Weake are foundations that are rear'd on sand, And on as weake grounds may we seeme to stand; Both subiect to be ruin'd, split, and raz't, One Billow shakes the first, one griefe the last. Whence then or how subsists this Earthly frame, That merits in it selfe no better name Then Shell of base corruption? 'Tis not Brasse, Marble, or Iuorie, which, when times passe, And our expired Fates surcease to be, Reserue in them our liuing memorie; No, no, this Mettall is not of that proofe, We liue as Those vnder a shaking roofe; Where euery moment makes apparant show (For want of props) of finall ouerthrow. Thus then me thinks you may, (if so you please) Apply this Statue of Agathocles. As he compos'd his royall Head of Gold, The pur'st of Mettalls; you are thereby told That th' Head whence Reason and right Iudgement springs Should not be pester'd with inferior things: And as his actiue sinnewie Armes are said (To shew their purenesse) to be Iuored, Like Pelops milke-white shoulders; we are giuen To vnderstand, our Armes should be to Heauen (As to their proper Orbe) enlarg'd, that we Might there be made the Saints of purity: By rest of th' parts which were compos'd of Brasse, (Being of bigger bone then others was) We may collect Men made of selfe same clay, May in their strength doe more then others may. Lastly, on Earth as Men subsistence haue, Their Earthly feet doe hasten to their Graue. Of Sleepe. Sleepe is the Prison that restraines the sense From due performance of her offices, Yet th'glorious Soule is of that excellence It mounts aloft, and scornes such Bonds as these; Shee acts when th'outward senses are asleepe, Building fantasticke Castles in the Ayre, And diues sometimes into th'obscurest Deepe, Conferring things that are with things that were; She fills the labouring Senses with extreames, And dreames of Loue if that she bee in loue, For what by day she thinkes by night she dreames; Seeming all mouelesse when shee's knowne to moue. Oft She betrayes the action of the day, While th' labouring Sense blabs on the dead of night, And guilty of her selfe seemes to bewray What we or did or thought, and though our sight Is fixt on no one obiect; yet the eye Of vnderstanding has her proper Sphere Wherein she moues and has her soueraignty, And being once there, she is euer there. Nor can Man properly be said to rest, When sweet-charmd Morpheus shuts his leaden eyes: Vnlesse it be by th'outward sense exprest, For th' Soule nere rests, nere sleepes, nere vacant lies: But as we see in Martiall pollicie While some doe sleepe some still keepe Centinall, That they may notice giue if ought they see Approching neere the breaches of the wall; So this same watchfull spie is euer seene Cautiue and circumspect least th'foe should win, Her strait-beleaguer'd fort and vanquisht cleane The Bodies power by letting Error in; Yet see we oft the temper of the Soule Follow the Bodies various temperature, And as foule water comes from Springlins foule, So if the Body be disposed pure Exempt from Passions, she will euer keepe A calme retension of her faculties: For guilty minds are troubled still with these. And this we see in Passions of the minde Or her Affections rather, there is none But is to some one humour more enclin'd Then to another; as the Chollerick one, Whose Passion spurnes at Reason, and delights In nothing lesse then to bee patient: And this he showes in darkest silent nights, When Sleepe aduiseth him to be content. Next is the sullen sallow Melancholly, Whose nature's Saint or Diuell, and it dreames Either of Subjects pure or most vnholy, For of all Humours this is in extreames. The third a watry crude, raw Phlegmaticke, (A bed-rid Humour) yet in youngest bloods, And he is spitting still and Rhewmaticke, Whose Dreames are neither bad, nor greatly good. The last and best, for it doth show affection In red and white is Sanguine, and is mixt So equally of all, as this Complexion Is th' onely one where Beauties Starre is fixt; And th' Dreames her senses whisper are so cleare From any thought of Passion, as her will Is o're her Passions so to domineere, That no delight may traine her vnto ill; All these doe dreame; but there's no perfect rest To any these, saue to a guiltlesse brest. Vpon the foure Constitutions As cold and drye attend on Age, so hot and moist on Youth; But hot and drye distempers show, farre more then any doth: The last (not worst) might well be first, is cold and moist together, Which giues digestion such free course, as it exceeds the other: All these appeare both heere and there, but no distemper's worse Our Gallants thinke, and so thinke I, then Drynesse of the Purse. Of Hospitality. Where art thou? no where? no, where's thy consort Of old Black-iacks, Blew-coats? They'r flown to th' Court Where they'r transformd. To what good Dyonise? To Pages like Pie-colourd Butterflies; Alasse poore Country, thou hast nothing then But vast penurious houses without Men; A row of smoake-lesse Chimneyes which agrees, With barme-lesse Hogsheds, empty Butteries, VVorme-eaten Rafters, VVindores Spider-wouen, VValls Snaile-belimed, a Loome-mudded Ouen Estrang'd from Bake-meats, nasty Dayeries, Halls hung with Caules and forlorne Nurseries. And yet Panurgus thou art more to blame Then Court house-keepers, for thou thinks no shame VVhen foot-bet Trauellers that's like to burst VVith heat, come to thy house to quench their thirst, To boult thy Buttry-dore and bid them goe To th'Alehouse, where th'aue nothing to bestow: VVherefore to saue their money, thou dost bring, These wearied Trauellers to some wholsome Spring, VVhere they may drink their fill; whenc't may appeare Thou'lt rather wast thy water then thy Beere. And thou Cremutius that doest nere display Thy Bounty but vpon thy Marriage day: VVhere thou inuites thy friends vnto thy store Of Resty Bacon; for thou hast no more Of Cates, to make their welcomming exprest, With one reserued Kilderkin of th' best; Whose Key thou kept as I informed am, Till thy Feast-day, and then thou gaue't thy Man: The wilie Porrus, who had so much wit As to appoint a time which might befit His iolly Cumrades to drinke vp thy Beere While thou and thy staru'd Guests conferring were: But by what hap I know not, he is found, With his Boon-socio's trauersing their round, Which makes thee sweare, fearing thy Beere should lack, To pull thy Blew-coate from poore Porrus back, But how did Porrus mittigate thy rage? Sir take your Coate, so you will pay my wage. But this doth little moue thy worthlesse minde, He weares thy Coate, thou keepes his wage behind. And Luscu, thou that neuer made expence, In vaine disbursements aboue eighteene pence In all thy time; me thinks I see in thee The Misers Mirror or Anatomie Rightly depictur'd, who hath wealth at will, Yet (like th'Hydropticke Man) is thirsty still: Seest thou not Luscus how thou starues thy selfe, To Cram thy Coffers and encrease thy Pelfe? And yet how fond art thou, all thou dost saue, Will in the end afford thee but a Graue, A Shroud, thus ends thy care, thus ends thy store: This Beggers haue and Princes get no more. And yet, vnhappy thou, drains golden streames, T'inhance thine owne by indirectest meanes. Making this Axiom with thy humour fit, Thou cares not how thou get, so thou may get: But if thou knewst what wiser men doe know, Thou wouldst not get before thou question how. The Shrift. A Time there was, and diuers there be yet, VVhose riper yeares can well remember it: VVhen folke were shriuen for th'sinnes they did commit And had their Absolution as was fit: Mongst which, as one crime doth another get, VVhere hope of Pardon doth authorize it, For Vertues Turtle-like doe single sit, But th'troope of Vices still in squadrons meete; A Boone-Companion to his liquor giuen, Came thither with his Neighbours to be shriuen. Steuen (quoth Frier) for's Christen name was Steuen, VVhat sinnes hast done to grieue the Lord of Heauen? Speake freely man, and it is ten to seauen, But by due Pennance I will make all euen: Confession is the way, when Man is driuen Into Despaire, that guides him vnto Heauen. I haue beene drunke last day and this day to, And may be next day too for ought I know: Tell me then (holy Frier) directly how Or in what sort I may my Pennance doe? Drunke (quoth the Frier) now by the faith I owe I know not what it meanes, nor as I trow Vnder Confession had I't ere till now, Yet come next day thou's heare what thou shalt doe. Meane while the Frier would not neglect his time, To know the secret of this drunken crime, Therefore betime, ere foure a clock did chime, This profane practice grew to be diuine: For Vpsefreese he drunke from foure to nine, So as each Sense was steeped well in Wine, Yet still he kept his rouse, till he in fine, Grew extreame sicke with hugging Bacchus Shrine: Vpward and downeward it did worke so sore, As if his vitall spirits could worke no more, Or that he were ariuing on the Shore Where Mortalls must ariue: but rid of store, That did oppresse his stomach ore and ore, At last he got a nap vpon the floore, Which hauing tempered his Braines, he swore To trye conclusions with the Pot no more. Stephen kept his steauen, and to the time he gaue, Came to demand what Pennance he should haue? What Pennance (quoth the Frier?) I'le tell thee knaue, I thinke it fit this Pennance to receiue: “Goe and be drunke againe; for if it haue “Th'effect with thee it had with mee, Ide craue “No sharper Pennance to the sinfullst slaue, “For soone it would possesse me of my graue. “Thus in this Sea of Sodome where each shelfe “Menaceth ruine to the forlorne Elfe, “The Drunkard is a Pennance to himselfe. Quidam erat. A preaching Frier there was, who thus began, The Scripture saith, There was a certaine Man: A certaine Man: but I doe read no where Of any certaine Woman mention'd there; A certaine Man, a Phraze in Scripture common, But no place shewes there was a certaine Woman: And fit it is that wee should ground our Faith On nothing more then what the Scripture saith. The Signe in Cancer. An Epigram. A crabbed Shrew, through sicknes weakly brought, Wisht by all meanes a Doctor should be sought; Who by his Art that hee her griefe might know, Felt both her pulse and cast her water too: Which done, he to her husband turn'd againe, And wishd him be content all was in vaine: For when the signe's in Cancer, she would dye; To whom her Husband answerd merrily: “If that (my learned Doctor) had beene so “She had beene dead beleeue it long agoe; “For these ten yeares and odde she has beene mine, “And I nere knew her yet out of that Signe. A Prize. Three Darlings haue I, and I know not which To make a Wife on; First is meetly rich, Faire, wife, but we in faith be different, And where that is there can be no content. The Next as louing as the Turtle is, Whose Lip distills pure Nectar with her kisse; But this 's my feare, her Nature is so prone To giue content, she cannot keepe to One. The Third is rich and wise and well adorn'd With inward graces, but she is deform'd, So as for all that I doe treasure lacke, I would not get it on a Cammels backe. VVhich should I haue of these they all loue me, One must I haue, I cannot haue all three? Himens Eglogue betweene Admetus and Menalchas. Menalchas. What makes Admetus sad? What ere it be Some cause there is that thus hath alter'd thee: Is it the losse of Substance, or of Friends, Or thy content in discontentment ends? Is it some scruple in thy Conscience, Which vnresolu'd doth leaue thee in suspence? Is it that thou thy long wisht loue should leese? Admet. No, no Menalchas it is none of these. Menal. Thou art not sicke? Admet. Nor sicke, nor greatly well. Menal. VVhere lies thy griefe? Admet. My Countenance can tell. Menal. Smooth is thy brow, thy countenance fresh enough. Admet. But Cares haue made my wreakfull minde as rough. Menal. Of Cares Admetus. Admet. Yes, I haue my share. Menal. Yet hope of cure. Admet. No hope of cure to care. Menal. Nay then I see 'tis loue that thee doth wring; Admet. Thou errst Menalchas, there is no such thing. Menal. If neither losse of friends nor losse of wealth, VVant to enioy thy Loue, nor want of health, If neither discontent, nor griefe, doe show Care in thy face, nor sorrow in thy brow, If thou be free as we all know thee free, Engag'd to none, what is it greeueth thee? Admet. VVouldst know Menalchas? Menal. Yes. Admet. Ile tell thee than; The Case is alterd: I'me a Married-Man. Thankfvlnes. The early Larke, from Earth to Heauen doth raise Her well-tun'd Note to chaunt her Makers praise, Why should not Men (indew'd with Reason) show Themselues more thankfull, sith more thanks they owe?
