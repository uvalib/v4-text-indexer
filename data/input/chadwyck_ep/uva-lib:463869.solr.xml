Of the conuersacion of saynt George in his adolescence and what gyftes of nature / grace and fortune aboundyd in hym. Capitulum. secundo. But nowe to touche / his ryches manyfolde He had of londes / and bestes abundaunce But namely plenty of syluer / and of golde His father and mother / his honour to auaunce Lefte with theyr sone / theyr ryches and substaunce His auncyent honour / the better to meyntayne Whiche he so ordred / that nought was spent in vayne. His fader dede / and gone as we must all Contynuyd george syngyll / and without wyfe Honourynge Idollys / of fendes Infernall As had his Parents / vsyd in theyr lyfe This blynde errour / was than so excessyfe That holy george / lyuynge in this errour Had no thynge harde / of Criste our sauyour But after the report / of this our true byleue Entryd his erys / kyndlynge his herte and mynde Incontynent / began / he to remeue His herte and mynde / from his olde errours blynde Hymself reputynge / to christ greatly vnkynde So longe to haue honoured / those fendes fraudelent And so in hast ran he / vnto our sacrament. He nought asshamyd / hym humbly to inclyne To all preceptis / of christ our sauyour Ryght mekely stodiynge / to folowe the doctryne Of christe: but for his elders had honour By warre and batayle / bolde in eche storme &amp; shoure Therfore george / wolde nat go out of kynde But in his youth on warre / set moste his mynde. In dyuers batayles / spent he his lusty age Subduynge tyrants / and mayntenynge the ryght The way deuysynge / in his moste bolde courage To vse such feates / as longeth vnto a knyght None bolder borne / none of more force nor myght No man was founde / aboute in that countre That coude mo poyntes / of valyaunce than he. To throwe a dart / by strength and clene puysaunce In londe or coste / no man coude better fynde All warryours / wondred of his valyaunce To se this knyght / to handell tourne or wynde A swerde or wepyn / of any sorte or kynde To throwe a plummet / or for to put a stone In Cappadoce / lyke vnto hym was none. To throwe a barre / or drawe a bowe of strength Was none his peere / nor to hym comparable Besyde the hede / his shaft a yarde of length Stronge / great / and myghty / to be in fleynge stable To drawe the same / his armys were so able That whan his craft / by exercyse dyd growe He hyd his arowe / nerehole within the bowe. To slynge a stone / as is the gyse of spayne Who had hym sene / he boldly durst haue sworne That in that londe / he had be bred certayne To ronne or lepe / none erthly man was borne That coude in swyftnes / one fote get hym beforne Or hyer lepe / into the ayre than he Suche was his strength / herte and agylyte. What shall I speke / howe manly he coude ryde Or tourne his stede / as quyckly as he wolde To mounte or lepe / or swymmynge hym to gyde No water / hedge / nor dyke coude hym withholde The ryder by craft / gaue wynges manyfolde Unto the stede / whiche lyght as is the wynde With touche of brydell / tourned and inclynde.

This Cyte / firste was foundyd as men wene By olde duke Bacchus / somtyme a man of fame And by his people / callyd men of Sylene Dryuen from the costes / of Nysus to theyr shame Whiche callyd this Cyte / Sylene / by theyr name And it defendyd / with myghty wall and toure The same instorynge / with men and great tresoure Without the walles / aboute the same cyte Was a depe dyche / the water moche vnpure The mote was large / and of great profundyte Infectyf / foule / and fyllyd with ordure The sent was lothsome / to euery creature Whether this vyle dyche / were watry or drye The stynkynge sauoure / yet bode contynually.
