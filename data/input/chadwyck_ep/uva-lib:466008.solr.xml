      <field name="fulltext">To my Friends, E. T. Peberdy and J. Davidson, In Memory of Happy Days in the Highlands gladdened by the two best things in life, MUSIC and LITERATURE. AUGUST, 1887.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Dirge of the Roses. Music, odour, moon Work within youth's blood. Who shall say how soon The roses bud? Nay I know not, only thisâ All the world's not worth a kiss. Pleasure, passion, fate Ripen sure and slow, Who shall say how late The roses blow? Nay I know not, only thisâ Manhood comes ere well we wis. Care, disease, decay Are busy hither thither. Who shall say what day The roses wither? Nay I know not, only thisâ There is something that we miss. Age, and cold, and rime Work in hidden shade. Who shall tell the time The roses fade? Nay I know not, only thisâ Old age hath but little bliss. Name him notâbut Death Breathes in every sigh. Who sees with what breath The roses die? Nay I know not, only thisâ I am ready when Death is. II. Love at all Seasons. Spring! Let us love! The time is ample: The lark, the dove Set good example. Come let us love. Summer! 'Tis ours! Honey-bee zealous, The fruits, the flowers Most plainly tell us That we should love. Autumn! The leaves That round us flutter, The grapes, the sheaves This warning utterâ That we should love Winter! Holloa! Rivers are frozen. The ice, the snow! The time is chosen That we may love III. The One in the Many. Flowers are born and die In the field, Some sweet, some odourless, Some made to heal and bless, And some to slay no less, But all are heavenly, And heaven in all revealed. Worlds are born and die Throughout space, Suns and circling spheres, And comets wild as tears, That fill the stars with fears, But all are heavenly, And run one heavenly race. Loves are born and die In the soul, Loves innocent and wild; Pure as a laughing child Some seem, and some defiled, But all are heavenly, And seek one heavenly goal. IV. Greeting. I send my love to you, And sweet repose, A snow-white dove to you, A fan, a glove to you, A crimson rose. The dove shall brood while you are fanned By singing maids to rest, The glove shall clasp your gentle hand, The rose lie on your breast. What will you bring to me Lest I despair? A flower, a ring to me, A ribbon-string to me, A lock of hair? The flower in music shall be pressed, The ring shall make me brave, The ribbon lie on my living breast, The hair-tress in my grave. V. Sphere-Music. Musical ecstasies Star-born of glittering skies! Spiritual symphonies, Immortal melodies, Mystical rhapsodies Of souls in Paradise! Star-galaxies that shine About the lucid pole, Your spirits speak with mine, Your myriad minstrels twine A harmony divine About my listening soul. Is it your song that steals Along the enchanted air? Is it your soul unseals The silence, and reveals A speech that calms and heals The tuneless hosts of care? My dazzled eyes are dim With gazing on the sky. By the horizon's rim, At the sea's shining brim, The planets reel and swim Frenzied with melody. Heaven's beating heart will break, It teems with magic songs; The waves tremble and quake And pulse with wild heart-ache; The love-tunes, as they wake, Burst forth in wingÃ©d throngs. Seraphs, come down to me Out of the silver rack From the moon's pearl-gate, ye Who cleave the clouds, oh flee Far, far o'er the dim sea Along the moonbeam track. Oh come, quicken my tongue, I too, I too would sing, As ye but now have sung, Of love that is ever young, Of the Heaven high o'er us hung And the soul's angel-wing. VI. The Mystery. What is it I know, I feel, At moments blind with tears, Voices from Paradise that steal, Glimpses beyond the spheres? What is it like a melody At which the whole heart aches, Neither within nor out of me, That suddenly awakes? Upon a woman's flushing throat I hear it pause and sing, I feel it in a sky-lark's note, Aud in a swallow's wing, The mellow purple hills afar, The moonlight on the lea, The passage of a shooting star The silence of the sea. What is it that we call love, Worship, and art, and song?â A music soft as chorus of A gathering angel-throng;â A whisper, as of seas and streams, From distant planets borne; An utterance like the voice of dreams Upon the verge of morn;â A brush as of swift seraph-wings That through the twilight pass; A sigh as of the murmurings Of the night-wind in the grassâ What is it that is all unknown But is the soul of us, That comes, that leaves us quite alone, So vague, mysterious? What is it for which we yearn?â Stars, sky, and sea are dumb. Ah peace! for we shall never learn, But wait and it will come. VII. From Soul to Soul. What was it but now that sped Through the solemn dusk? A keen a wingÃ©d odour shed Of mignonette or musk? What was it that made us start In the quick moon-beam? The message of a human heart A spirit, or a dream? You turned your eyes; you moved your lips; I saw a sweetness spring, A vision, an Apocalypse Of angels on the wing, Like kindling flame, to your soft gaze; And in my inmost breast I felt an answering frenzy blaze Miraculous, mixed with rest. Ay, there are things we know not of, Spirits half-felt at whiles, Immortal messengers of love That visit us with smiles! Else what was it, so fair, so fast, So formless, so divine, So splendour-winged, but now that passed From thy soul into mine? VIII. Song in the Light. In the light of the crimson even The wild birds float and sing. Out of the depth of heaven They issue on the wing; And all the air is choral; And the long fields fresh and floral, And the mountains many-folden, And the rich cloud purple and golden Seem, and the forest olden, To join their carolling In your smile's twilight spaces Sweet thoughts will sing and float. Out of the soul's hid places They issue with glad note; And the rills, and the streams, and the rivers, And the stars, the sweet light-givers, The fading twilight, the grasses, The golden and red cloud-masses, The ridges the mountain-passes Sing from one throbbing throat. IX. To One Beloved. What is moon or star to me By night, or sun by day? What are storm and shower that flee O'er drear coast and angry sea, Cliffs under the tempest's lee, Cataracts at play? Thou art moon, and sun, and star, Joy by day or night. When thy cheering smile is far, On the lake, where lilies are, Vainly lures nenuphar Void of grace and light. Thou art glory on the cloud, Light upon the hills, Bird-notes in the forest loud, Gleams that break the arches bowed Of the beech-trees tall and proud, Silver on the rills. Thou art splendour to the day, Softness to the night, Tenderness in the moon-ray, Freshness in the ocean-spray, Grandeur on the tempest's way, Courage in the fight. X. A Complaint. What have I done That thou shouldst slight me? Star, moon, sun No more delight me. What have I done That thou shouldst slight me? How far, how far Wilt thou still try me? Sun, moon, star Seem to deny me. How far, how far Wilt thou still try me? How soon, how soon Is love ungrateful! Sun, star, moon Are hideous, hateful. How soon, how soon Is love ungrateful! What have I done That thou shouldst forget me? Star, moon, sun Sicken and fret me What have I done That thou shouldst forget me? IX. Light Within. Lady mine, the faint year sickens, The leaf turns yellow, and falls, and dies. But my heart revives and quickens Though but fed with tears and sighs, Not till spring the tree recovers; Ever it is spring with lovers Who can dream of loving eyes. Lady mine, though dull cloud saddens Mount and sky with heavy gloom, Thy remembered presence gladdens Wasted garden, lightless room. Wintry storm the country covers; Ever it is spring with lovers While the young heart is in bloom. XII Absence. Tediously the hours creep on Fraught with many miseries. Glad am I when each is gone With its sad monotonies. Dismal, dismal is the rain Beating on the window-pane. I am here alone, alone; She who was, sweet day by day, Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, Heart of my heart, is far away. Dismal, dismal, the wind's flight Moaning round the house all night I am lonely, life is void, Restless fever preys no more. Poesy, music, half-enjoyed, Leave the craving heart so sore. Dismal, dismal the stirred leaves Rustling vaguely 'neath the eaves. Like the soul out of my soul, Like the life out of my life, She is gone, and to one goal All my thoughts wing weary strife. Dismal, dismal the watch-dogs bay In the farmstead far away. Why am I so prisoned here? Why is she away from me? Is it duty? Is it fear? Or the harsh world's cruelty? Dismal, dismal, my thoughts prey On my tortured breast alway. Yet be peaceful. Wheresoe'er Stray her steps by this moonshine, Still her thoughts, her love, her prayer, Her soul almost, all are thine. Dismal dismal, the harsh fate To be loved but desolate. XIII. Doubt and Certainty. What is it the future bears In the womb of pale to-morrow? Hopes or fears, or joys or cares, Anguished griefs, or dull despairs? Love me, love, through joy and sorrow. What is it the present gives? Brief delights we can but borrow? Ours the present while it lives; Love is love while it forgives; Love me, love, through joy and sorrow. XIV. Wisdom and Power. We are wise, for we have known Mutual love, the angels' feast. What is there that is not shown To that spirit whose wings have flown Past the earth-cloud to Love's throne, And burned incense t'ward the east, At his altar a pure priest? We are calm, for we have found Mutual love, the angel's quest, Who are they sit robed and crowned With a starry peace around? Souls that suffered and are sound, Love-completed, passion-blest With the holiness of rest. We are mighty, we have slain Life and death, and hopes and fears; We have known love, joy, and pain. Whatsoe'er in its domain The grim future holds, we reign With our feet upon the yearsâ Though our crown be gemmed with tears. XV. Tears. When boyhood is sowing In hope to reap, Their grace bestowing The sweet heavens weep. When crops are sowing Let rain be cheap. Boyhood's warm and generous tears Augur well for the coming years. When youth is growing His golden grain, Love-tears flowing Are fruitful pain. When corn is growing Men welcome rain Heroes wept: in early years Gentle feelings are fed with tears When youth is mowing His early hay, The rain-storm blowing Is wished away. When grass is mowing Give me a dry day! Deep is the well-spring of holy tears, Shallow the brook of the laughing years. When manhood is strowing Its ripened corn And summer glowing, Tears meet but scorn. When the sickle is strowing Tears cannot be borne Heroes wept: but the busy years Leave now no leisure for wasting tears. When age is done stowing Its garnered store, Raining or snowing It matters no more. When wheat is done stowing All care is o'er. Memories, and regrets, and tears, These are the solace of useless years. XVI. Song. What is the meaning of the spring If I may not love? The stirring life in everything, The kindling lights above! How shall I join the song of spring If I have no love? The birds at early dawn that sing, The cooing of the dove? What shall I send her in the spring To mind her of my love? A hair-fillet, a jewelled ring, A garter, fan, or glove? XVII. Song. (Motive from Hood.) Gold leaves on the tree, Red fruit in the garden, Storms out at sea. Since the summer dies, pardon If human hearts harden. Gold sheaves on the plain A few still remaining. If the harvest-moon wanes How profits complaining Of human love waning? Blue ice on the lakes, The plains white and cheerless! Ah but my heart aches. Nay, cold hearts are fearless; Love is dead, I am tearless. XVIII. The Foes of Love. Love hath many evil foes Lurking ever near Bent on mischief, but of those He fears most is Fear. Fear! Nay love is strong and brave. Wherefore should he fly Hunger, pain, disease, the grave? He fears more a lie. Lies! From Love's long-suffering Falsehood cannot hide. Truth from the furthest star he'll bring. Rather he fears Pride. Pride! Nay, Love, if Love be strong, Humbles Pride in the dust. Love forgiveth every wrong. Rather he fears Lust. Lust? From lust and treacherous deeds He hides his tortured faceâ Infatuate he forgives, and bleeds. More he fears Disgrace. Disgrace? Though Love must weep at sight Of aught that shames his prayer, His charity is infinite. He fears only care. Care! Ah yes the mighty things Lightly Love can bear, Not the daily bickerings Of insidious care. XIX. Hypocrisy. What will you say to me, Queen of my heart? Meeting, good-day to me, And, when we part, Farewell, good-night, good-bye? Which are we, you and I, Shy hypocrites or sly, Wretch that thou art? Say rather, meeting me, âChance willed it so!â As your guest greeting me, âHow bold you grow! Who bade you come to-day?â Ah, but still choose, I pray, When I would leave, to say âWhy must you go?â XX. To the Spirits of Dawn. Fires of the orient, Heralds of golden dawn, Over the mountain sent Hill-slope and river-lawn! How in my breast ye wake Love-leap and sorrow-ache, As from one instrument Sweet sounds and sad are drawn. Spirits of day that blow, As upon breathing flutes, Love-melodies that glow, And on immortal lutes! Faint are the waves with love, The blue sky swims above, Sweet passions ebb and flow In herbs, and flowers, and fruits. Angels of morn that ope Sun-gates of Paradise, River-lawn mountain-slope Gleam in your kindling eyes. Fire-flocks of golden wings Soar like a flame that springs, Leap like a splendid hope Up and up through the skies. Warriors of light that urge Chariots of flaming fire, Over the dazzling verge Nigher ye come and nigher, Up the long clouds in streams Rolling, like glorious dreams, Like bright winds on the surge, Higher ye sweep and higher! XXI. The Language of Love. You speak to me, my gentle one, In the tongue of woods and birds, Winds, waves, and clouds, and moon and sun,â Melodious mystic words. Vague utterances of the spheres, Hints of the gliding streams, A language holier than tears And lovelier than dreams. I seem to hear the murmuring leaves Caressing neath the moon, The converse sweet the forest weaves Under the stars in June, Voices of lovers by mute waves, And notes of nightingales, And the long ripple that laps and laves The sea-shore after gales; And far into the past I see By vague or vivid gleams, And my old thoughts come back to me And my forgotten dreams. Feelings of sweetness and desire That visit earliest youth, Uplooking visions that aspire, Resolves that reach at truth; And then my whole rapt soul falls down In one adoring trance, To touch the hem of your white gown Look in your countenance, To meet your downward-bended eyes As o'er a child asleep, And in their light of sweet surprise To kiss your hand and weep. XXII. What shall I Sing? Sing, sing to me, and give me joy, A bird-note wild and strong, The music I loved when a boy To hear the whole day long, A lark aloud, above the cloud, Sing to me, child, of joy. Sing, sing to me, and give me woe A plaintive cadence sweet, The music I loved years ago Sitting at your dear feet, A nightingale, in moonlight pale, Sing to me, dear, of woe. Sing, sing to me, and give me pain, A note of keen desire, Music that enters in the brain And sets the heart on fire, A woman's note where night-winds float. Sing to me, sweet, of pain. Sing, sing to me, and give me peace, A still, a quiet strain, The music I shall love when cease The throbs of love and pain, A seraph-song where angels throng, Sing to me, love, of peace. XXIII. A Moment. For a day we two were wed, One day in the year! Wind, and sun, and rain were shed, Sigh, and smile, and tear, On our happy bridal bed; But we felt them near Hovering o'er thy nestling head, Death, and Pain, and Fear. For an hour we two were wed, One hour in the day! Death, and Pain, and Fear were fled Miles and miles away. Lips on lips were sweetly fed, Heart on heart; but say, When those evil three were sped Why did Sorrow stay? For a moment we were wed, A moment in the hour! Death itself was buried, dead, Grief a blossoming bower. All I knew was splendour shed Into me and power, Your eyes the sunshine overhead My soul an opening flower. XXIV. Why? What hast thou done to me That I should love thee? That moon and sun to me Grow pale above thee? Thou hast made glorious Life, cold, laborious. How is it wonderful then that I love thee? What can I find in thee That I should love thee? Soul, heart, and mind in thee Glory above thee, Joy as a goal for me, Love, a new soul for me, How is it marvellous then that I love thee? XXV. Again Why? If I say the flower grew, Must I give a reason too? If that water is a boon In the heavy heat of noon, That the heart is light in youth, Will you question of my truth? If I say the hour is sweet When sunset and twilight meet, If birds voices I may call Delicate and musical, Moonlight pleasant on the seaâ Will you ask how this can be? If I speak of cold in snow, Will you crave how came it so? If I chcerless call the rain Terrible the hurricane, Must I give with each a cause Why the thing was as it was? If I tell you, you are fair, Must I add when, how, and where? Stately mien, voluptuous form, Eyes so large, and dark, and warmâ Love I these as all men would, Must I show you why I should? XXVI. Night Sounds. Noises of the night! Mystic sounds of sadness! Whispers of delight, Sobs, and sighs take flight, Mixed with yells of fright And wild howls of madness Tempests of the night! Echoes of the billow! The moon pale and white Sheds a sickly light, And ye moan the plight Of my lonely pillow Memories of the night! Singing, sighing, sobbing! Wild regrets that blight Slumber, will ye quite Blind with tears my sight Break my heart with throbbing? XXVII. Growth and Decay. Life is in me, Power onward flowing. Herb, flower, tree Are ever growing. What we shall be There is no knowing. Death is in me, Forever preying. Herb, flower, tree Are aye decaying. What we shall be There is no saying XXVIII. Love-Song. Come to me by greenest lanes White with hawthorn-flowers, Woodland nooks where from the rains The frail violet cowers, Cottage-porches by the plains Where o'er latticed window-panes Tenderly the peasant trains Arches of rose-bowers. Come to me by dreamiest lakes In the forest's keeping, Where the nightingale awakes While the world is sleeping, Where each ripple whose heart breaks Is a melody that aches, Like a soul which love forsakes, Weeping, weeping, weeping. Glad or mournful be the scene, Day or night, my dearest, Sunlight gold or moonlight green, Joy or grief be nearest, Thou of all things heard or seen, Things that shall be or have been, Lark and nightingale, art queen, Cloudiest and clearest. XXIX. Love grows by Love. Love that is born of fire Is lulled to death by pleasure, But love, the soul's desire, Increases out of measure. On thy soft lip's caresses It grows as flowers by dew; Thine eyes between thy tresses, Like sunlight shining through Leaves and boughs and flowers, Feed it from above, And thy tears like showersâ True love grows by love. Love, that the lovely earn, Is like a miser's treasure. The more of thee I learn, Love grows in equal measure. The debt I owe thy beauty By that sweet usury Which makes delight a duty Would make an end of me; But leaf's and flower's renewal, And voice of lark and dove,â All nature is love's fuelâ True love grows by love. XXX. Death. O'er none he passes, The poor man saith, Wild flowers and grasses Escape not Death. No place is holy, However lowly: Quickly or slowly It feels his breath. On all he closes, The rich man saith, Lilies and roses Are food for Death. No palace-splendour Can make Death tender. Some day all render To him their breath None he refuses, The leper saith, Foul weeds have uses For this same Death. Nothing so rusted, So loathsome-crusted That Death disgusted Flees from its breath, At all he reaches, The lover saith,â Apples and peaches And flowers for Death. Nothing so gracious But this audacious With lips rapacious Feeds on its breath. XXXI. A Child's Death. The little hands clasp thee, And tenderly tighten, To keep thee, to grasp thee; The little eyes brighten. What is her vision? Of Paradise portal, Meadows Elysian And rivers immortal? She is gone:âher white finger Unlocks and uncloses. Why should she linger After the roses? XXXII. Song. Gentle be thy word! In so sweet a sky Only sweet things, heard Or unheard, should flyâ Voice, and lute, and bird, Bee and butterfly. Tender be thy mien! At so sweet an hour Only sweet things, seen Or unseen, have powerâ Soft scent, and sigh, and scene, Love, and light, and flower. XXXIII. Flower of my Heart. Thou flower of my heart, I have set thee where no sun sears In the innermost part: I have watered thee with my tears. My own thou art; Blossom for many years. Thou gem of my breast, I have casketed thee in a shrine Choicest and best, I have bought thee with blood, thou art mine. Take thine ease, be at rest, Thou hast nought now to do but to shine. XXXIV. A Question. From what sick soil grows The sorrow of the years? From what sad source flows The spring of all our tears? Alas! who knows The limit of the spheres? On what sad shore sounds The sigh of the lapsing hours? What vague sea surrounds This dim isle of ours? Alas! who bounds Man's sufferings or his powers? XXXV. Spiritual Irradiation. When the smile is on thy lipsâ As the fair moon from eclipse Naked forth and shining slips; As the prisoned music, pent Deep within the instrument, Issues if thine aid be lent;â 'Tis thy soul I seem to see Come forth from its sanctuary. When the love is in thine eyesâ As the solemn stars arise Soft and clear without disguise; As the yearning sounds awake From the country at day-break, Forcing the full heart to ache,â 'Tis thy soul I seem to see Come forth from its sanctuary. XXXVI. Endurance. Lights upon the grasses, Shadows on the moss, Where a bird's wing passes Or green branches toss. Forest, field, and meadow Live through shine and shadow, Man through love and loss. Ah but I have founded All my hope on thee; With thee my life is rounded As with sky and sea. Leaf, and fruit, and flower Survive the storm and shower But not the parent tree. XXXVII. Nature. River, forest, stream To my spirit are As a distant star, As a dream within a dream. Mountain, valley, plainâ The world's beauty appears As the relief of tears To an unknown pain. XXXVIII. Aspiration. Wherefore do our spirits pine With a yearning so divine For the distant dim sea-line? Why so deeply strangely crave For the furthest leaping wave Of millions that together rave? Why wet we with tears our cheek At sight of the far mountain-peak? With hushed voices wherefore speak In the presence of the stars? Wherefore watch their shining cars As captives look through prison-bars? All things radiant and remote, All sweet sounds that seem to float From the distance, the sad note Of a bird, of wave, of wind Seem as if they would remind Of a life we have resigned Seem as if they would awake Musings, memories which partake Of a hope that we forsake. 'Tis thus on the doubtful spheres We can scarce look without tears. Were they our home in vanished years? XXXIX. History of a Flower. I saw a golden flower Its bright petals ope In a sunny hour, And I called it Hope. Hope whose life hath any length, Must be fed on pride and strength. I saw the rude wind play With its petals sere On a stormy day, And I called it Fear. Sere had not the petals grown Vainly had the tempest blown. Then the freezing rime Clutched the fragments torn At a chilling time, And I called it Scorn. Had the leaves clung to the stem Frost had ne'er laid hold on them. But soon they hard and cold As frost itself became Long ere they were oldâ And I found no name. Hard but weak the poor shreds were; Courage is not like despair. Last, a small green thing I saw sprout and ope In a second spring, And I called it Hope Strength and weakness meet on earth; Courage hath such second birth.</field>
