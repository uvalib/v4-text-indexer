      <field name="fulltext">âThe waters sing to the shore, The forests sing to the sea, All that hath motion in land or in ocean Is gifted with minstrelsy.â Laman Blanchard. TO CHANDOS LEIGH, Esq. THESE PAGES ARE GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED. I.âAUTUMN. Now is Harvest's golden time, And the year is in its prime!â Field and forest, fruit and leaf, Standing corn and corn in sheaf, Wholesome herb and noxious weed,â All that in the rank marsh breed; All that brave the broad noontide; All that under hedges hide, By the curious eye descried, Though they close and covert keep, And along the ground they creep,â All have ta'en the Autumn tint. Nature's hand too fast doth print (Glance the eye where'er it may) Signs and shadows of decay,â That decay which ripeness brings On the life of living things,â Tracing for the eye of Thought Themes which never can be taught Better than by truths which come With no sermonizing hum, But with solemn silence steal Upon the heart, and make us feel, Whether we would feel or no, The death which comes on all below. Hence, far hence, all melancholy, Though its thoughts are wise and holy! Let no tear of vain regret Make the eye of Pleasure wet; Let no thought of life's decline Shadow faces fair as thine With the heart's suffusÃ¨d shine! Man would look unthankful now With a gloom upon his brow; Beauty would less beauteous seem, If a tear should quench the beam That with kindling fervour burns Wheresoe'er her bright eye turns. Nature, she looks cheerful still, As when May first made her thrill With the news of coming Spring And return of blossoming; When the hawthorn, which at eve Wore the drops the spring-frosts leave, Spread with morning's mellow light Into stars of silver white;â And the lark,âwho had not sung While the ice on hoar-branch hung,â Found his wakeful voice again, And springing from the furzy plain, Flutter'd up with rapid wing, Making Earth's high arch to ring With the same sweet carolling He had pour'd, in accents clear, To the last departing year. May is gone, and August now (Crown'd about his ruddy brow With a wreath of ripen'd corn Gather'd in the heat of Morn) Steward is of all that store (Gold in hue, but valued more) Which the old and dying Year Leaves to his wide-squandering heir Hark, the ripe and hoary rye. Waving white and billowy, Gives a husky rustle as Fitful breezes fluttering pass! See the brown and bending wheat, By its posture, seems to meet Harvest's sickle, as it gleams Like the crescent Moon in streams, Brown with shade and night, that run Under shores and forests dun. Lusty Labour, with tired stoop, Levels low at every swoop Armfuls of ripe-coloured corn Yellow as the hair of Morn; And his helpers track him close, Laying it in even rows On the furrow's stubbly ridge: Nearer to the poppied hedge, Some who tend on him that reaps The border, pile it in quick heaps; And the little gleaners follow Them again, with whoop and halloo When they find a hand of ears More than falls to their compeers. Ripening now the sun is high, Some, too early reaped, doth lie; Some, upon the parchÃ¨d ground, Till the gatherers come round; Some in graceful shocks doth stand Nodding farewell to the land, Mother of its wholesome birth: Some is borne, with shout and mirth, Drooping o'er the groaning wain Home through green and hedgÃ¨d lane;â See the large, life-giving load Wagging winds along the road!â Wider than the way is wide, It sweeps the hedge on either side, And on the dangling briar leaves A swinging ear from passing sheaves. Hark! the anxious, cottage-poor, As it darkens past their door, Hail it with a generous cry, Though they'll buy it bitterly. See the old are in the sun, Watching that the work is done As it was when Age was young; And the harvest-song is sung; And the quaint and merry tale Takes the stint-key from the ale, And as free and fast it runs As a June rill from the Sun's Dry and thirsty-drinking mouth. Mirth doth ever feel a drowth! Butt and barrel lessening flow Fast as cans can come and go;â One with emptied measures comes Drumming them with tuneful thumbs; One reels fieldward, not quite sober, With two pitchers of October, Some of last year's brewing, kept Till the corn of this was reapt; And all are welcome to the cheer And full bounty of the Year! Now 'tis night, and done all labour, And to merry pipe and tabor, Or to some crack'd viol, strumm'd With country skill; or table drumm'd To the time of some old measure Wont to stir the pulse to pleasure, Men and maidens briskly beat The ringing ground with frolic feet; And the laugh and life go round Till all mirth in noise is drown'd. Some are weary of the day; Some untired yet with play;â Those steal home to healthy beds,â These drink on, till dizzy heads (Humming with the potent fume Of old ale, which makes the room Run round with them like a wheel, And the tapers dance a reel,) Tell them they have had their share Of that night's most bounteous fare. If they jest now, hiccups thick Foil the slow-tongued and the quick; And the tale, with many a shout At the teller, dribbles out Like the last drops of that ale Which made excellent the tale. That drank out, the merry jest Seems not good, or not the best; So with one consent they break Up the harvest's happy wake, Grateful for the merry cheer And full bounty of the year;â With many a thank ye, and low bow To him who gave, and gave enow, And wish sincere that many more Harvest-months may lift the floor Of his garner to the ceiling, And they be there to welcome in The latest cart, with lively din And long, loud shout to heaven pealing. II.âTHE WEAVER'S WIFE. Oh Willy, you're a weaver good As ever shuttle threw,â The bird which threads the tangled wood Winds not his way more true;â But, Willy, you're an old man now, Your hand flies not so fast;â The drift of age is on your brow,â Your working-day is past! Ah! 'tis a long day, Will, since when I knew thee but a child, As lively as the jerking wren, As warbling woodlark wild;â These locks were then of youthful white, Which now are aged-grey; These failing eyes were full of light As heaven is in May. 'Tis Time has changed you only, Will, You have not changed yourself By passions which their thousands kill, Nor sold your days for pelf;â No good of life has been your curse, And stole your strength away; No evil grown from bad to worse Will darken your last day. Then never droop, my good old man, You've done your duty well; As husband, father, artisan, You bear away the bell!â Our children bless your aged head, Their children bless it too; And when you rest among the dead, Their tears will follow you. Our daughters are a handsome race,â You wish'd them like to me; Our sons they have their father's face,â A better cannot be;â Oh may their lot, as our's has been, Be neither high nor low, Then happy to their graves of green Like us, at last, they'll go! Then let me kiss that comely cheek, Where lingers still the smile That cheer'd me, when the world was bleak, With many a pleasant wile. This hand, that trembles now in mine, The tear that fills your eye, Confess our hearts know no decline, Nor shall they till we die! God meant us for each other, Will, For both our lives have run Together, and are woven still Like many threads in one!â In infancy, I mind it well, Our mothers, in their glee, Pair'd Willy Gray with Lucy Bell, And so it came to be. And I recall it fresh to mind, As 'twere but yesterday, When with our little hands entwined We straggled miles away, And in the sun and in the shade, And by the river's side, We prattled, slept, and waked and play'd From morn till eventide. I've been your wife now fifty years, And have endured my share Of mothers' pangs and mothers' fears, But not an hour of care! Smooth as the current at our door, My days ran calm and even, Cheer'd on by Hope when we were poor, Our confidence in Heaven. We have not far to tread the hill, Ere we shall part with pain; But there's a world beyond us, Will, Where we shall meet again;â Our love, which here had little dross, Shall there be more refined; And all our sinsâoh welcome loss! Forgotten, left behind. III.âTHE FALLEN FOR FREEDOM. All honour to the dead,â The buried and the brave,â Who for their country bled, And made the world their grave!â The earth is over them, And silently they sleep;â But a reed shall sooner stem The mighty rolling deep, Than the slaves of Power still The storm which now they shun, Or bend a Nation's will To the tyrant will of One! A thousand heroes fell, And startled millions leap, At their spirit's passing-bell, From their slavery and sleep!â Their strife was for a day, Their pangs are overpast, But their glory is for aye, And the good they did shall last, While noble hearts and true Are born to hate the thrall Of tyrants and their crew, And for their Manhood fall! All honour to the slain, The loyal unto Man, Who broke their Country's chain, And fell in Freedom's van!â Whoâbreathing human breath, And bound by human tiesâ But envies them the death That crown'd their enterprise!â Sleep, sleep, ye daring dead, Ye buried and ye brave! The world for which ye bled Shall consecrate your grave. The slaughter'd Spartan few Who stemm'd the Persian tide, Their spirits welcomed you When gloriously ye died! And Freedom's Chief of Men, Who laid the Geisler low, His spirit hail'd you then, His aim was in the blow That struck, and struck them down, That day, and for all times, The treasons of the Crown, And its anointed crimes. Where Kosciusko slept In his forgotten tomb, A solemn shadow swept, With shrieks as from the womb Of Nature when she wakes To re-assert her right; And the sable Eagle quakes With palsying affright!â Roll on, thou mighty sound! God speaks his will in thee, And bids the nations bound Fling their shackles to the ground, And live, or perishâfree! IV.âTHE INVITATION. Mary, when the Sun is down, Steal unnoticed from the town, Through the dew of daisied green, Gone from sight as soon as seen;â Bend thy steps to where the rill Winds around the woody hill,â Giving to thy lover's arms Truth, and youth, and sacred charms. When the night hath darken'd eve, Thou thy bower may'st safely leave;â Thou canst have no dread of night, Having thoughts as pure as light!â Vice may then not be a-bed, But the wicked have such dread Of a chaste-eyed maiden's frown As will keep rude passion down. When the bat hath tired his wings, And the cricket shrillest sings, And the sad-sweet nightingale 'Gins to tell her tender tale, Steal thy way across the green Like a shadow faintly seen, Or a late-returning dove Winging lonely to her love. When the first star of the night Beams its ruddy rays of light, (Like the lashes of thine eyes Startling Sleep, that sweetly lies Like a bee upon his bed Nestling by a bluebell's head,) Wind thy way through green and grove Silently as moonbeams move. When the dew is on our feet, Then the woodland walk is sweet; When no eye but Heaven's doth see, Then 'tis sweet with thee to be!â We have pass'd long hours alone, Overseen and heard by none, And may wile a many more, Till our lifeânot loveâis o'er! V.âTHE COMING IN OF SPRING. The voice of Springâthe voice of Spring, I hear it from afar!â He comes with sunlight on his wing, And ray of morning star: His impulse thrills through rill and flood, It throbs along the main,â 'Tis stirring in the waking wood, And trembling o'er the plain! The Cuckoo's call from hill to hill Announces he is nigh; The Nightingale has found the rill She loved to warble by; The Thrush to sing is all athirst, But will not till he see Some sign of Himâthen out will burst The treasured melody! He comesâhe comes! Behold, behold That glory in the East Of burning beams of glowing gold, And light by light increased!â The heavy clouds have rolled away That darkened sky and earth, And blue and splendid breaks the day, With universal mirth! Already, to the skies the Lark Mounts fast on dewy wingsâ Already, round the heavens, hark, His happy anthem ringsâ Already, Earth unto her heart Inhales the genial heatâ Already, see the flowers start To beautify his feet! The Violet is sweetening now The air of hill and dell; The Snow-drops, that from Winter's brow As he retreated fell, Have turned to flowers, and gem the bowers Where late the wild storm whirled, And warmer rays, with lengthening days, Give verdure to the world. The work is done;âbut there is One Who has the task assignedâ Who guides the serviceable Sun, And gathers up the wind,â Who showers down the needful rain He measures in His hand,â And rears the tender-springing grain, That life may fill the land. The pleasant Spring, the joyous Spring! His course is onward now;â He comes with sunlight on his wing, And beauty on his brow; His impulse thrills through rill and flood, And throbs along the main,â 'Tis stirring in the waking wood, And trembling o'er the plain. VI.âTHE STREAM OF HOME. Dear stream, that winds my native vale, Thou clear and shining river, Pursue thy path through hill and dale, And fill thy course for ever! Oh may thy gliding waters creep Their wand'ring way to ocean, Silent as love, where love is deep And breathless with devotion. Dear vale, deep pictured in my heartâ Sweet home, that holds its treasure,â The love which lives its purest part, Its hope and holy pleasure,â May lovely flowers long paint thy banks, With early April springingâ The lark still waft his warbled thanks, Till all thy heaven is ringing! She lives along thy margin green Who loves thy gentle waters,â For beauty's bloom, and beauty's mien, The fairest of thy daughters!â Oh may the current of her days Flow tranquilly and even As thy sweet wave, when starry rays Lend earth the light of heaven! Dear stream, go visit the retreat, Where she her passion ponders, And lay this garland at her feet, With wave that silent wanders!â So shall the Fairies evermore, When summer moons are glowing, At evening haunt thy yellow shore, And keep thy waters flowing. VII.âTHE MILLER'S TREAT. Now, Dame, do you hear what I say?â (Confound the old mill's noisy clack!)â Some neighbours will drop in to-day, So spread them a plentiful snack;â There's a bottle of mum in the bin, And a cask of good ale on the floor; That flitch, there, will do to begin, The piece, Dame, that's nearest the door. Where's Nan, with her clucketty-cluck, And Fan, with her game-feather'd legs? Go call them together, my duck, And take me a tithe of their eggs;â For Tag, our song-smith, will be here, Ned Guager, and merry old Matt,â Three fellows that cherish good cheer, And, thank Heav'n! we've plenty of that. Yes, lad, you may quiet the mill,â This fair-day you shall have a treat; When we work with the grain o' the will, Then labour, that luxury, 's sweet; But thy heart is all at the Fair,â There's work to your mind o'er the lea, When Sue with her blue eyes is there,â Well, boy, it was once so with me. There, get you along for a dolt, Leave tweedling and twirling your thumbs; And if you're inclined for a jolt, Take Captainâhe's fond of the drums. Now mind you are home, boy, betimes, And bear yourself handsomely, do; And buy little Sue some old rhymes, A knick-knack, and ribbon or two. My corn shootsâa thorn 's in my thumbs, And Bitch 'gins her left ear to prick;â Something wicked this way surely comes? That pitch-pipe of psalmody, Dick!â Why, Stave, you can smell out a feast As pat as our parson a tithe! But welcome, old lad, to the best, If hungry, and drouthy, and blithe. Tut, man! never stand by the stair, Nor waste time in making a leg; Draw hither a stool or a chair, And hang up your hat on a peg. Come, tell us the news of the dayâ You're larned, and likely to know;â The church is in danger, they say,â The steeple was ten years ago! More friends!âby my mill, it is Tag!â I'll swear to the darns in his hose;â And with him comes Matty the wag,â I feel all the warmth of his nose!â You're welcome, good boys,âsit ye down; And now, my own Dame, spread the board; These rashers would make Cuddy Clown Refuse to change place with a lord! Here's Guager!â'tis he by his halt!â Well, Teddy, how works the excise? Whose sins are the deepest in malt? And how are the widow's bright eyes?â But this is no time for a word, For here comes a dish for a king; The eggs, look, are white as a curd, The rashers still bubble and sing! Now, Stave, with your long-metre faceâ â(Down, Pincher!âhave done with your pranks!)â Come, murther a 'fore-dinner grace,â 'Twill not eat the worse for that thanks:â The dinner gone down, o'er the ale John Tag, here, shall troll us a song, And the laugh and the merry old tale Shall push the day lightly along! VIII.âSERENADE. Mary, dearest, if thou hearest, Answer me, if I am dear!â I would hear none, I would fear none, Were I whispering to thee here. Then step lightly down, as sprightly Fairies do on flower-bedsâ Love so soft is, that not oft his Feet betray him where he treads! Let me press thee, let me bless thee, Now the solemn moon doth shine! Let me wake thee, let me take thee, From the arms of Sleep to mine! Time is speeding while you're heeding Doubt, who will advise delay;â Ah! why fear, love? None can hear, love, What the hearts of lovers say! Stars are looking stream and brook in As thine eyes look into mine; Heaven is ringing with the singing Of the bird whose voice is thine!â Here's an hour, in life's power, We should use while use we may;â Who'd lie wasting hours, which hasting, Take the youth of love away?â Shall I clamber to thy chamber Like the fragrant eglantine That hangs eyeing thee, and sighing As its love out-passion'd mine?â Shall I enter, where to venture Is like heaven after death, And awaken thee with taking Kisses honied with thy breath?â IX.âSONG OF THE SPANISH EXILE. Oh happy, loved Spain, flew my hours In bowers, I never may sport in again! When the dark maid I cherish'd caressing And pressing, All pleasure but mine seem'd a pain: Click-click went the quick castanet, And twang-twang the lover's guitar; Can mem'ry these dear joys forget? Ah noâthey are sweet, though afar! Oh Spain! dear Spain! How cheerfully then came the dawning Of morning On dances which lasted from eve; 'Twas then the bolero's grave measure Gave pleasure, Which tyrants can never conceive! But farewell the olive's green shade,â The silent siesta at noon;â And farewell my light-footed maid, Who danced like the beams of the moon! Oh home, dear home! Oh England, thou friend of the falling, When calling On thee in the day of despair, The hearts of the brave men who perish Oh cherish To bless thee with many a prayer! Giveâgive us our country again, And bid us but dare to be free, And the harp and guitar of old Spain Shall ring out with anthems to Thee! Oh Spain! dear Spain! X.âSUMMER. Now the Summer's face is brown, Let us shun the sultry town For the haunts of shade and dew, And the skies of smokeless blue; For the green and breezy hills, And the ever-running rills, Where their silent way they take By the foot of flowery brake, By the poets' nooks and bowers, Where the birds, and bees, and flowers Sing, and love, and live their hours, Nothing thoughtful of the morrow, Knowing neither pain nor sorrow, But, content with what is given, Live, and do the will of Heaven. We who are of Nature's making, And have souls that should aspire, Shall we not, from sloth awaking, Lift the voice and sound the lyre? Nature, shall she work alone, And be seen of brutes, or none? Shall her flowers bloom and die Undelighting human eye? Shall her music, ever-quiring, On the senseless air expiring, Be, like toning of the spheres, Only heard of heavenly ears? Shall her youth and age of greenness, And her comeliness and cleanness, Serious glee and holy gladness, That are ever without sadness, Be, like beauty to the blind, Unbeheld but of the mind? Shall her seasons come and go Like an unattractive show? Never!âthere are some are wiser; There are poets still who prize her; And immortal minds that yearn Wisdom from her lips to learn; There are eyes which still can read Truth and worth in vilest weed,â Form in things which to the eye Half-read is but deformity,â Grandeur in mean things and small, And God's great handiwork in all! Dear one, thou and I will prove We are not too cold to love Nature, and to reverence Her from no disguised pretence, But a homage high and holy, Which hath neither melancholy, Nor a thought of pain or fear To alloy it with a tear. Let us, now, on rested feet Seek her, in her temple's seat, Under her blue dome of sheen; On her altar's floor of green, In her pillar'd aisles of trees, Where her silver censers swing, All her abbey incensing, And her praiseful minstrels hymn Holy airs and harmonies Learn'd of Heaven's cherubim. Hie we to the fields away, While the white, unstainÃ¨d Day Blushes like young innocence At the fear of an offence. Who with senseless Sleep would toy? Sleep, that sister is to Sloth; Who to leave her bed be loth As the cold Latmian boy, While the beauteous Nature wakes, Like fair Dian, for our sakes?â See! the kine have left their lair; And the creatures of the air, Warbling bird and buzzing fly, Rising, wing from earth to sky;â And the early dew-worm creeps Slowly round the little heaps That about its caverns lie Like the fairies' tumuli;â And the rabbit from his burrow Slyly slinks along the furrow, Where the high corn hides his route, Looking timidly about, Lest the poacher's lurcher nigh Track him, with far-watchful eye, To his haunts 'mid fragrant thyme, And so bite him, ere his prime, With sure teeth as tooth of Time. See! there are few clouds in heaven, And the central one is riven, And the sun comes bright between Into ether, blue and sheen,â Like a ship by ice-isles pent, Breaking all impediment, And in glory sailing on Till its enterprize is won. See! the giddy-whirling swallow Leaves alone his hidden hollow, And careers around the river On white wings he wetteth ever. And the Lesbia-fondled sparrow Onward darteth like an arrow Twang'd from bow of Robin Hood. Hark! the proud lark fills the sky With his anthem loud and high;â And the cuckoo in the wood Gives a voice to solitude;â And the blackbird whistles oft In the brake by fencÃ¨d croft, Which the ploughboy halts to hear, And drawing to the thicket near, Mimics long with whistle shrill Something of his sweeter skill, Then treads on with hopeless heart, Learning only, to his smart, (What is soon or late discerned,) That Nature is for Art too learned! Loud the mighty-throated thrush Sends his voice out, with a gush, And a lengthen'd, liquid note Seems to rend his strainÃ¨d throat. What is good may still be mended: Thus, his first rehearsal ended, He records his song once more, Sweetening what was sweet before. Now he falls, and now he rises, Till his own ear he surprises, And, elately fluttering, Claps his many-speckled wing,â Like a poet pleased and proud When his lyre rings so loud, That the hard-worn worldly throng Hear, and praise his lofty song. Hark! the bee about our ears Hums a tune that ever cheers,â Like yon merry maid at labour, Wanting neither pipe nor tabor To make music for that spirit Which her bright heart doth inherit, Where her lively pulses dance Till they flush her countenance;â Happier girl than happy bee, May you sing thus constantly! Now the brooks in silence run, Lest their babbling tell the Sun Where they in thick sedges hide, For his warm and thirsty mouth Would drink them to the desert's drouth, Though they were of Nilus' tide. And the milky-breathing cow Tears the grass with frequent low;â And the frog, no longer leaping, But in some sly hollow keeping, Which the ox made with deep heel, Hides as closely as he can, Lest the proudly-sailing swan Snatch him up for her moist meal. See, the strong, unsparing mower Levels with his scythe of power Star-eyed daisies, and the flower Children hold beneath their chins, So to learn who 'tis that sins When the butter wastes by night; And whose chin looks yellow-bright, That's the rogueâif no such luck, Then 'twas ta'en by thievish Puck. Now the day is at its noon, And the thrush hath hush'd his tune; And the deep-delighted dove, Like a maid whose joy is love, O'er her quiet passion broods In the woods and solitudes. Heard no more is the cuckoo, And the lark is hushen too. Under a green hedge's shade Scanty scraps are coolly laid For the faint mowers' small repast, Swallow'd soon, with hungry haste. Near them, but still where the sun's Fierce eye scorches, clicking runs The gay grasshopperâminstrel he To their poor festivity;â Yet they hearken, weary-still, To his busy song and shrill, That doth warn them, with voice small, To enjoy the interval, Till the tasker's voice shall call Labour from his cool retreat To the noontide toil and heat. Pleasant now with Poet's book Idling in some greenwood nook; Or by smoothly-slipping stream, Shelter'd from the burning beam, Where the nimble minnow lies Watchful for the falling flies, That drop ever and anon, Float a moment and are gone;â And some trite old moral draw, Some wise folly, Sancho-saw,â How we mortals, frail as they, Having buzz'd our longer day, Drop like motes through sunny beam Into Time's oblivious stream! Pleasant, too, to wander lanes Where no rut of wheeling wains Yet has crush'd the spear-like grass; Where the tatter'd gypsey-lass Sidelong eyes you, as you pass, With a dark Egyptian leer; While her swarthy mother near Reads your looks with subtle eye, There to learn if she may try Something of her lying art On the easy-cheated heart. And 'tis pleasant now to be In full orchards, and there see All about your shaded head Richest fruits of rosy red:â Yellow, brown, and ruddy pears, Ripening in soft southern airs; Here, the Adam-tempting apple; There, the grape-vine, that will grapple With its neighbours far and near, Clinging here, and creeping there; And the downy peach and sleek, Like an infant's careless cheek; And the prim and plumpy pine; And the blooming nectarine:â Or where rubious cherries peep Through their green leaves at the lip Of sweet Beauty, wandering by, Blushing just as rosily. Sweet through forest depths to stray, Scarcely pervious to the day, So immatted are the leaves Which the ivy interweaves,â Where the foot must force its room, If therein it will presume Where Darkness sits in solemn gloom. Stumbling on, at every tread Something stirs inspiring dread. Wither'd verdure, sapless sticks, With such dry things as intermix, Crackle every step we take, While the hollow ground doth shake Wheresoe'er a foot we plant, Like some old volcanic haunt. Bats and owls, and such dark things, Move aloft with scaring wings. Startled snakes, that take amiss The strange intrusion, with a hiss Salute our steps as on we stride, Then glance away with silver glide. Then what pleasure to emerge Sudden on the forest's verge, Where the noon-light breaks with pain On the shrinking sight again!â There, beneath the sober shade By a clump of fir-trees made, The dappled tenants of the glade, Couching where few feet repair, Among the green moss make their lair. Scarce a falling foot can sound, And far they fly with lively bound! One, than his compeers more bold, Halts, and makes an oak his hold, Arches his fine neck, and eyes Our daring march with mild surmise, Then lifts aloft his branchy head, And ere we breathe again is fled, Quicker than the eye can follow, Till we lose him in the hollow. Now is come the dewy eve, And the lone bird on the thorn Teaches even Love to grieve; And the pale Moon, and forlorn, Treads away, like Melancholy, Far from the dull hum of Folly!â See! the moonlight and dark shade Move about in glen and glade, Like a handsome Moorish maid Amorous of some Southern boy, Met by stealth to kiss and toy, In some leaf-enwoven bower, Where the night-awaking flower And the lime-tree's golden bloom Feed the air with faint perfume, And the honeysuckle clambers Like young lovers to the chambers Of sweet beauties, beaming through Lattices with eyes of blue. Sleep's swart mother, silent Night, TorchÃ¨d by the Pleiads' light, Travels in her dusky car, Whose still wheels do never jar, Lest they wake her daughter dear, (Sooner scared than watchful Fear,) Who hath doff'd what Care encumbers Light heads with, and softly slumbers. Muffled in her mantle dark, Till the dewy-footed Dawn, Who will scare the turfÃ¨d lark, Rouse her up to see the morn. XI.âTHE YEOMAN'S SONG. When maddening tempests lash the land, And rush along the sea, The poorest hut on England's strand A pleasant home must be!â Whilst lightnings from the heavens leap, And mariners grow pale, I sleep, as round the wild winds sweep, And find delight By day and night Within my native vale. The seaman he may careless sing When kindly seas are 'round, But not like me when laughs the Spring, And verdure clothes the ground. The cuckoo's call from hill to hill Brings more good cheer to me Than voice of sea-winds whistling shrill, Or roaring seas Lash'd by the breeze;â The lark my minstrel be! A ship it is a noble thing When beating down the waves, Or battling for our island king With foreign foes and slaves!â The humble cot is noble, too, That shelters honest men, To love, and home, and country true, Who for the right Would bravely fight, And what is wrong disdain!â The Oak that shade and shelter lends To England's cottage-floors, Is dear to me as that which sends Her thunder from her shores!â Mine, mine be still the rural life, The shore and not the sea;â But should rude War roll here his strife, My hardy hand Shall guard the land, And strike where strike the Free! XII.âSONG. In a lovely Summer night, When the Moon with mellow beam Streak'd the meads with lines of light, And with silver touch'd the stream; When the pines upon the hill Stood like lofty pillars still, And the air was warm with balm, And the woods were dumb and calm As a gentle maiden's dream, With my tender love I stray'd In the trembling willows' shade, Where the warbling waters play'd Of the winding Avon stream. 'Twas the Nightingale that near Where the sounding waters well, From the fragrant-breathing brere Broke the silence of the dell With the music of her song, Heart-eloquent and strong, As listening long we stood, In the path that winds the wood, To the tale she loves to tell. And until the dawn we stay'd In the trembling willows' shade, Where the mingling moonbeams play'd, And the sounding waters well. XIII.âSTOLEN LOVE Oh love it is a weary thing, It will not let a young heart be; It gives the bloom to woman's spring, Or bids the rosy colour flee!â As I came up by Severn stream, I met a stranger from the sea, Who stole my heart beyond redeem, And then away he went from me! His eyes were blue as wild-wood bells Which in the summer sweetly spring; His voice gave music to the dells,â The birds sat dumb, and fear'd to sing!â And oh! he press'd me o'er and o'er To promise I would be his bride, And took me to my mother's door, And then soft won me from its side. He told me all that he had borne, The storms and wrecks of many years, And oh! my pitying heart was torn To see him struggle with his tears! I would have heard him all the night, For I could feel it eased his heart To tell his tale of Fortune's spite,â But neighbours watch'd, and made us part. He vow'd to me he would be true, And I believed his honest word, And should have stay'd till morning-dew, But mother in the cottage stirr'd. One kiss he gaveâthe first, the last, And parted, looking still behind, And then he sped away as fast As thistle-down upon the wind. I would not, if I could, regret The evening we together pass'd, The fated hour when first we met, No, not while life and love shall last!â But he's away upon the sea,â Oh use him well, thou mighty Main! And waft him soon and safe to me, To bring my heart its peace again! XIV.âORIGIN OF THE RED ROSE. It was the sultry noontide hour, When Bacchus revell'd in his bower. Rare was the wine, by Tuscan hands Express'd with care in Tuscan lands; Wild was the dance, for cymbals beat The clamorous time to cloven feet; And many a PÃ¦an loudly pealing, And mirth-shout shook the leafy cieling; And swill'd Bacchantes, headlong reeling, Crush'd the White Roses with rude tread, Till all the air was essencÃ¨d. âBring me,â quoth He, the crown'd with vine, The ruddy god of radiant wine,â âBring me yon pallid flowers, and lave Them in this generous wave!â Wan and virgin looks be their's Who unto Dian pay their prayers; But flowers, that woo the amorous Sun, Should take the tint by which he's won; And these, ere half my rite be done, Shall wear the blush this nectar wears, And be as beautiful to see As Ariadne, when that she Is fairest, and most pleases me; Or PhÅbus, when his purple tent Opens in the Orient, Or when his glorious head he lays Where Thetis wets his dusty bays!â He ceased, and while the sylvan rout Hung mute-wondering round about, Plunged them in a mantling flood Of the red grapes' luxurious blood;â Immediate, o'er their paleness spread A tint like that which stain'd the breast Of her to Collatinus wed, When to her heart the steel she press'd That vindicated the chaste pride For which she lived, and losing, died. Then rose a shout of triumph up; Clang went the cymbal and the cup; Round and round the dancers wound, Till the rapid-beaten ground Rung resonant to the sound! While he, Semele's son, The ripe, the rosy One, Sat with exulting air, And shook his purpled hair, Felt that his powers were great, And took the lofty state Of Jove's imperial heir! Venus heard the wondrous truth, And Hebe,âgoddess of sweet youth,â And came as fast as thought to see The lovely curiosity. Venus kiss'd it, and her breath Lives in it in life and death;â Blushing Hebe said it should Emblem budding womanhood;â And Love himself,âwho was at play With his Psyche, far away Where the dark leaves cool'd the day,â Partly ran and partly flew This new miracle to view;â And to guard it, set it round With those barbÃ¨d thorns which wound:â And thus from that day unto this Love, Youth, and Beauty's flower it is. XV.âTHE CALL OF LIBERTY. What voice of awful sound Is that which thrills the ear? It shakes the Nations 'round, And Tyrants learn to fear!â It is the warning cry Of Libertyâwho calls, With shrieks of prophecy, The People to their walls! For she discerns afar The Troubles as they rise;â Beholds the van of War, Hears Havock's vulture-cries, The clank of cannon-chains, The Hosts that hate the Free Tramp o'er the groaning plains To Discord's symphony. Fear not, ye Free; yet guard The strongholds of your power, Keep careful watch and ward On mountain-top and tower;â But ye who wear the chain, (How little it may fret,) Assert your rights again,â Demand your Fathers' debt,â Now while a dread endures Which shakes the Triple Throne; Russia, Prussia, and Austria. While chainless limbs are yours, And courage is your own; Now while the Island Free, Exulting, cheer ye on To Man's ThermopylÃ¦ And Freedom's Marathon;â Now while her fluttering wings, Upon the Southern shore, Alarms the souls of Kings Like a hundred Etnas' roar!â Yes, quail, ye Tyrant Ones! One blow of her strong pinion Could dash ye from your thrones, And break your base dominion! She pauses, but beware When next she takes her flight! Her cry shall fill the air, Make dreadful day of night, Hurl your high towers down, Lift up the mean and low, Melt sceptre, globe, and crown In her fiery thunders' glow! She fled when Poland fell, But long her murder-shriek Shall make one heart a hell, And blanch his blood-dropt cheek!â She rests, but does not sleep,â Noâfor her cry again Shrills o'er the silenced deep, And volleys up the Maine. Ye Allemanian Numbers, She calls ye to awake Like lions from their slumbers, And through your bondage break! She calls ye, by the blood Of your redoubted Sires, Pour'd like the Rhenish flood, To re-arouse your fires! If ye are Christian men, The sons of those who met The Papal Tiger, when Its fangs it loved to wet In gore of martyr'd saints, Now, when a bloodier foe The air of Heaven taints, Dare ye withhold the blow Shall crush the purple pride Of Rebels unto Man?â Yes, if ye dare abide The Three Worlds' bitter ban. By glorious Luther's creed, Melancthon's holy mind;â By those who rush'd to bleed As victims for mankind;â By Huss's fiery death, Which set your altars free,â Peal, or resign your breath, One shout for Liberty! Rouse,âand your chains are riven! Strike,âand your foes shall fall! Ask,âand your friend is Heaven! Shrink,âand deserve your thrall! XVI.âGUARDED SLUMBER. Sweet river, flow gently thy way to the ocean, Thy waves soft as music when sylphs are in motion; My fair one, way-weary, she sleeps by thy stream,â Flow gently, sweet river, and break not her dream! Ye winds, thro' the green branches tenderly sighing, Breathe softer than roses in Summer's lap lying, And still as an infant whose slumber is deep;â Breathe gently, ye wild winds, and break not her sleep! Ye birds, that are lightly among the leaves springing, Oh wake not my love with the gush of your singing, But sing as the heart does when pleasure is deep,â Oh hush your loud warble, and break not her sleep! XVII.âTHE BLIND MUSICIAN'S SON. Twelve mournful months have pass'd away, And I with grief have striven, But find with each receding day The arrow deeper driven!â The mother's tearsâthe father's groanâ The silence of the friendâ The agony when left alone, Tell not of sorrow's end!â My cherish'd boyâmy only oneâ My joy in miseryâ My hope in ageâmy gifted son, Would I had died with thee!â Thou wert a star unto my way,â In blindness blessed light; But now indeed I feel that day Is double, double night! Thy father's friends they all were thine;â They loved thy socialness, The warmth which hail'd them thine and mine, The welcoming caress!â They miss thee much, but not so much As he who still must mourn:â I miss thy kind hand's filial touch, Which ask'd the kind return;â Where'er I tread I miss thy feet, Which safely guided mine;â I miss thee in the peopled street, And where the waters shine! What pleased thine eye, I saw it thenâ Thy sight was sight to me;â But all that's fair to happier men Is lost in losing thee! They told me thou wert comely too;â My fingers oft would trace Thy young and gentle features through, And find in them a grace,â A something in thy open brow Which spoke the enlarging mind;â But all my pride with thee is low, And I am lone and blind! My sightless orbs will upward turn, As if to look for thee In that far world, which I must earn With years of misery!â I wake the organ's voice, and think I hear thee answering; But down my baffled spirits sink, And tears immediate spring! The tears are vain which then I shed,â But who will dare to blame The grief which bows a father's head, That wears a father's name?â My cherish'd boyâmy only oneâ My joy in miseryâ My hope in ageâmy gifted son, Would I had died with thee! XVIII.âFAIRY REVELS. âSuch sights as youthful poets dream On summer eves by haunted stream.â âMilton. Come hither, Fancy, on thy silent wing, With no more noise than blossoms fall in Spring; Come from thy viewless mansions in mid air, And waft me from this weary world of care, Which, as we know, we less admire each day, And turn with painful heart the eyes away, Glad to escape its thraldoms, and dispel The dreary vision which we see too wellâ Glad to close every avenue, and bar The offended ear from its discordant jar,â Music with some, and sights without offence;â But with a few, cursed with too sharp a sense Of life's sad hopes and drear realities, They shock the trembling nerves and sear the tender eyes! But thou, sweet Fancy! when this heavy life Weighs down the labouring heart, canst lay the strife, And lift the spirit, struggling with its clay, To worlds of purer air and more celestial day! Then, hence with Seriousness, that sorrowing thing, And all the cloud and gloom which she can bring! And come, soft queen of sleep and silence,âcome With glide invisible and lyric hum Of magic music, such as upon the soul Of thy Mozart in dreamy sweetness stole;â Come with thy quaint attire and antic train Of fairy folk, such as bewitch'd the brain Of thine own Shakspeare, mindful slumbering Upon some vernal knoll where May had flung Her flowery tribute at the feet of Spring, Lull'd by young bees the violets among, The lapse of waters, and the spring-born breeze Singing Eolian airs to Summer in the trees! Show Me such sights as Poets see in dreams, In summer's serious eves by haunted streams; And first, and more than all, visibly show Things now invisible, which I would know:â The sylvan plats which have ere now sustained The snow-light tread of tiny-footed fairies, Swarming what time the nightingale complained;â Show where Titania view'd their wild vagaries; What bending bell-flower hung her canopy; Where, couch'd on golden moss, the King sat by; Of all her dames, which one allured the gaze And love of Oberon, as through the maze And interweavings of the dance she wound With feet which noiseless beat the printless ground. Then, queen of phantasies, convey me where Titania wept his dalliance with her; And where her fine tears fell, a dew-like wet, Born of her eyes, sprang the blue violet. And then relate, or show my searching eyes, The mirth and manner of their mummeries;â What merry mischiefs Puck, that pranksome elf, Play'd to please them and recreate himself; And where, to shun their penalty, in cell Of darkling mole he dived; and where he fell Headlong and heedless in the dewy well By slow-worm sunk in sand, and certes would Have drown'd that night, had not a fay-friend stood Within his call, and flung a slender string Of well-spun gossamer, which Puck did cling To and was saved. What laughter long and loud Rang thro' the woods, raised by the fairy crowd, Cluster'd like bees along the bosky banks, When they heard tell of all his merry pranks. While the King listen'd, how an acorn cup, With Tuscan wine of ruddy grape fill'd up, Fell from his hand, laugh-shaken, on a flower White as the brow of Dian, from that hour The Red Rose named. What missions FaÃ¯a went That night upon:âfirst, round the firmament, To waft the sphere's immortal melodies For music to that night's festivities:â Then, with the lightning's speed, on fin-like pinions, To search all-grasping Neptune's large dominions For drinking-pearls,âprying in sparry cells And coral grots, cleft rocks and gaping shells, Following the sun from Europe unto Ind, Till she had found the few which took her mind. How she uprose from the deep-diving sea To its smooth-water'd surface suddenly, In bubble of her breathing, fast pursued By savage Mermen in thick multitude. How in a dewdrop blown to a balloon She went a voyage round about the moon; And where it burst, and like a shooting star Headlong she fell while yet from earth afar, Amid a group of fairies on the ground 'Lighting like snow, withouten harm or wound. Then half o'er earth, to gather glowworms, twice; Once to old Mab, to crave her presence; thrice To Fairy-land on secret missions; then To the still darken'd East, for tidings when The sluggish Sun would issue thence agen, That they might get their revels timely doneâ For Fairies love the Moon's mild light or none. In sooth it is a curious sight to see Them wind the verdant glade traced out to be The stage for dance, and rout, and revelry!â Soon as still Night upon the wakeful Hours Imposed her silence, and the day-born flowers Shut till the dawn their golden censers sweet,â In quaggy dingle, where their glancing feet, Soft as the down of swans, alone dare tread,â While yet the stars not half their course have sped, Ere Cynthia yet has turn'd her harvest beams Full on the earth, and silver-strow'd the streams, The Fairy World, roused from their chinky cells In grots unkenn'd by Man, and flower-bells Blooming afar from touch of human hand, By general summons to all Fairy Land, Muster as soon as call'd, like summer swarm Of gnats that play when Evening fears no storm. This way they come!âI see the honour'd ground Mark'd for their masque; and hear the fitful sound, Now near, now distant, of their herald horn Along the languid air with drowsy slowness borne; The shout, the chorus, and the band of shells, The lyres by soft winds twang'd, the pealing bells;â Behold the numerous lights dim-twinkling seen, Which point the pathway of the Fairy Queen; The glistening arms and helms and armour bright, Pour on my pleasÃ¨d ear, and glance upon my sight. And first come on a martial-marching troop Of tuneful-stepping Fays; and now a group, In sheeny garments gaily glittering, O'er mossy turf come swimming ring in ring; Each heart as light as the small, frolic feet That shake but do not shed the dewy weet, Like jewels pending from the daisy's crown Sunk in cool slumber on the freshening down. Swift they sweep on, with antic-tripping tread, By prankish Puck thro' hedge and thicket led; And where they pass the shaken wild-rose sheds Star-sparkling dews upon their comely heads. Comes now a beauteous band of Fairy maids; Each bears a rushy torch, through murky shades Of darkling forest (lit by no kind ray Of star or moon) meant to direct their way. They might have trusted to their eyes' young fires, Which certes burn with undisguised desires, But from the glowworm they have ta'en that light Which makes a day for them in Darkness's despite. The mellow Moon, full-orb'd, with smile serene, Looks from high heaven upon the radiant scene. Darkness, that hover'd with eclipsing wings Between her glory and the beauteous things Which in her light a softer beauty wear, Flies from her face to his mid-forest lair. Leaves glitter now; and rills, that fear'd to run Beneath the fervent shining of the Sun, Let their clear currents loose, and sparkling play Now in broad viewânow wind unseen away. And now behold a yoke of mice, so white, The snow-drop whitening in the spring moonlight,â The pearly spot that parts the raven hair Upon the brow of beauty debonair, The dawn which blends the dusk of night with day, Are not so delicately white as they.â Glittering with gems, their harness is the skin Of a springe-strangled mole, caught in the sin Of pilfering parson's tithe; the shining traces By handy Puck were glean'd from greenwood places, Where that most careless weaver, Gossamer, Had hanging left his skeins. Upon the back Of jaded mouse an elfin perch'd, with spurs Pluck'd from the angry wasp, oft goads and stirs Them to their task; and many a brisk smack Of his far-reaching whip (it seems to be A leg of the long-spinner) momently Lashes their soft sleek sides. How may I tell The beauties of their car!âIt was a shell, Tribute of Oberon to his Queen when he First wooed her love in white virginity,â A car of pearl, won from the Orient, Where rainbow-hues, harmoniously blent, Mingle like those which arch the firmament: Beauty has touch'd each part, and from within Blooms like a lovely face unstain'd with sin. Nor does it lack the wonder-working aid Of fay-artificers, who have inlaid The rounding rim with glittering gems of price, And graved its sides with many a quaint device. Placed on the backs of grasshoppers, the springs Are their lithe limbs: the wheels, those regal rings The Venice bridegroom wed the sea withal: The spokes are golden pins, bright, short, and small, Pull'd from the robes of maids who in their beds Dreamt wantonly; and o'er their gracious heads For canopy a cowslip drooping hings, And scatters fragrance round as gently stirr'd it swings. Such is their pomp. But how may I relate King Oberon's feast, of meats most delicate, And strange compounds of daintiest niceties?â The honied thighs of plump HyblÃ¦an bees, Strung on white cricket bones in twos and threes, And brownly broiled by slow marsh-fires, are sent First to his craving kingship: were his Lent Long as some subjects lasts, he could not eat More hungrily. Now he devours three sweet Delicious bags which never went to hive,â Rich interceptions,âby the twilight Fays Forced from benighted bees, who hoped to thrive By their late toiling and too-covetous ways; And now, the unctuous and honied tips Of small flies' feeders; with the gum that drips From pregnant belly of the ripening plum; And, for his bread, a sacramental crumb Dropp'd from the lip of holy-minded Nun, A sin-despising, self devoted one, To Mary dedicateâher sins forgivenâ Her heart unmix'd with earth, her spirit wandering heaven. These other dainties come by fits and starts:â Limbs of grasshoppers, and the sweet red hearts Of merry crickets; with the glutinous eyes Of bats and birds, beetles and butterflies; The slimy dewlaps of full-pamper'd snails, Gather'd from bushy brakes and verdant pales; A miller-moth in poet's taper singed; The moles small eyes, by fairy-farmers springed; Some twice-stolen eggsâfirst, by a school-boy brood, Then snatch'd from them whilst sleeping in a wood; A bee's fat thigh in his own honey stewed, And served in silvery shell, a dainty jelly, Makes paunchy Puck delighted smooth his belly, And smack his lickerish lipsâin vain. And next On fire-fly's brain he feasts, and seems sore vext The dish is scant, and elfin-cooks are blamed; But they know well his anger may be tamed, And quick as falcon flies, to cool his ire, They serve the plumpy haunch of barn-mouse, roasted By the few sparks of routed gypsy's fire; With pilfer'd bits of bread, from burning ovens Pinch'd by shrewd Puck, who likewise nipp'd the slovens: These in the moon-rays parch'd and nicely toasted, Give crisp employment to his pugging teeth, And leave but little time or breath to idly breathe. Some score of lordly fays high fed with pride, For the low common crowd too dignified, Keep, as such mushroom men should do, aloof;â A loftier mushroom serving for a roof, They sit in circle to a plenteous feast Of dainties plunder'd from an emmet's nest, His winter-store of food. You would have thought These ravish'd cates were prodigally bought, They eat them with such pomp and pursy mirth,â Much like some larger lords who batten on this earth! What is Titania's drink?âa ruby drop Of sacred wine from golden altar-cup Spill'd by a sinner's trembling hand, at start Of waken'd conscience. The death-tear of a heart That broke in penitence, a Magdalene's; Milk of a Fairy-mother, when she weans With honied syrops her wee baby fay; The tinted drops that fell in rainbow showers In weeping April and out-laughing May; Rich distillations drawn from fragrant flowers, Such sweets as bathe the dewy march of Day; Small blobs of dew, gather'd when glow-worms twinkle; The holy sheddings of a water-sprinkle, Which exorcised the lewd demoniac crew Tempting some reverend saint: the honey-dew Shook from the rose, whom the impatient bee Startled from slumber all too suddenly, With clamorous brattling of his brawling horn, Which blew for entrance to her fragrant bower Ere early birds pick'd out the blossom'd thorn, And Morning glanced from her high cloudy tower. These dainty drops which her coy palate please, Which freshen, but not madden, and leave no lees, Serve for her after-drink, and keep her cool, When night is spent, wisely the day to rule, Which the intemperate King will drowse in bed, With leaden-heavy eyne, and noisy-humming head. Dancing they have, and music rich and rare, And instruments right beautiful to see:â A lyre is one, strung with the golden hair Of Sappho, drownÃ¨d in the Lesbian sea; And drums, of halved shells and leathern wing Of bat outstretch'd, keep lowly murmuring, Much like the drowsy hum of evening bees, That interweaving wind among the summer trees. And there are pipes of reeds small and minute, And the shrill shrieking of an oaten flute, And many sounds, unsweet themselves, which blent, Make a wild music, that gives much content To ears tuned only to mad merriment. Much mirth there is, which waggish Puck excites, Playing such pranks as Fairy Land delights, Now on a thread of gossamer that swings From flower to flower, he vaults, and featly dances; And now on back of grasshopper he springs, And rides the fairy-ring, and leaps and prances, And now is thrown, and nimbly mounts again, Till laughter shakes his wagship's sides to pain. So came they forth that night, and such their court, Their dances, feasts, and wanton whim and sport, Which they untired maintain'd, and homeward went Startling the sleeping air with shouts of merriment. XIX.âLILLA. Oh Lilla is a lovely lass As ever man did woo! Her eyes all eyes on earth surpass, They kill and cure you too! Her winsome waist, however laced, A hand might span it all;â Her shoulders fair, lit by her hair, Whose yellow tresses fall Like sunbeams shed upon a bed Of lilies in mid June, Or golden light in summer night Soft streaming from the Moon;â These are charms which moral men May behold with careless eye; I, who am devoutest then, Love them to idolatry! Her ruddy lips, like scarlet heps, The balmy breath between; Her soft sweet tones, who hears them owns The music which they mean; Her hands and arms have each their charms; Her nimble-stepping feet, The very ground loves their light sound, Soft as her bosom's beat:â Her winsome waistâher shoulders, graced With sunny showers of hairâ Her voice, how sweet!âher dancing feet, Her face, like heaven's, fair;â These are charms which moral men May behold with careless eye; I, who am devoutest then, Love them to idolatry! XX.âTHE TEMPTING WOOER. You shall have a cloak to wrap you in, My own young dear, When Winter's war with roaring din Comes rolling near; And a Lord's wife in her pride Shall not stand my love beside, When she's drest to be my bride, My own young dear! You shall have a cap and bonnet too, My own young dear, With ribands deckt of every hue, My own young dear! And a comb of shining pearl Shall add light to every curl That adorns my winsome girl, My own young dear! You shall have a scarf and silken gown, My own young dear, And mittens, hose, and satin shoon, My own young dear! With a band to clasp your waist, By a golden latchet graced, And a bodice silver-laced, My own young dear! You shall have your golden finger-rings, My own young dear, And glittering stores of trinket things, My own young dear, With an honest man to boot, If ye will but hear his suit, And give an answer to 't, My own young dear! XXI.âYOUTH AND AGE. Oh give not thy youth unto age, Jessy, Thy chasteness to old desire;â His love may be hot for a sage, Jessy, But mine is the Etna's fire! If Autumn be young as Spring, Jessy, And Winter as Summer warm, Then still to the old man cling, Jessy,â The young one may do thee harm! 'Tis Love o'er the high wall springs, Jessy, On feet falling light as a leaf; 'Tis Love at thy lattice sings, Jessy,â He knows the old man is deaf. Fear not the dews and the night, Jessy, For neither will do thee ill; When thou art warm with delight, Jessy, No coldness but love's can kill. Heed not the world and its blame, Jessy, But fly to thy lover again; The wanton may crimson with shame, Jessy, Thy cheek cannot wear such a stain! Fear not foul Calumny's blast, Jessy, The search of Suspicion meet;â I'll give thee a name, which shall last, Jessy, When they are the dust at thy feet! XXII.âGOOD NIGHT. Good night, sweet heart, good night! Love's enemy, the light, Shoots in with sudden dart;â The star that loves the dawn Beams on the brow of Morn;â Good night, sweet heart! My path will lose the ray Which lit my darkling way Through wood and widening glade; Yet I would have thee gone, My own beloved one, Till evening's shade! The Nightingale is done! Not far, then, is the Sun, And we must say Farewell!â The hours are few and fleet Till we again shall meet In this lone dell! When hoarse the cuckoo calls, And slant the sunbeam falls, And village vespers chime,â When you the shadows see Of evening streak the lea, It is the time! To bed, sweet love, to bed!â The birds stir overhead, The darkness turns to light;â Look where the gray is seen, The leaves again are greenâ Good night! good night! Oh do not linger now! The white upon thy brow It is the light of day; Into thy cottage steal While dusky clouds concealâ Away! away! XXIII.âSONG. Come, brim your glasses, For Night now passes, With many a heavy-wingÃ¨d Hour!â When wine we measure We stint our pleasure, And turn a sweet of life to sour;â Whilst bumper-drinking Will drown low thinking Till light is winking in Morning's bower. 'Tis true, the sages Of many ages Have told the stages of joy's declining;â That 'tis our duty, When Youth and Beauty Are in their Eden-bower reclining, To warn the heedless;â But ah! 'tis needless, For where is joy without repining? We need not banish Our smiles, which vanish Like sunshine from the April flowers; Life then is fleetest When joy is sweetest, As beauty flies from Autumn bowers! I know we cherish The things which perish, But we must take what here is ours. To look around us Might well confound us, For death has bound us on every side;â The young we cherish'd Are old or perish'd, And those we lived in mostâhave died! When Love lies weeping O'er Beauty sleeping, Oh who would keep in a world thus tried! XXIV.âTHE ONCE-SEEN BEAUTY. I saw her in too brief an hour, That Beauty without beauty's pride, As humble as that lowly flower The primrose by the pathway's side. Her hair was like the golden rays That fall on mountain-heads of snow; And angels might admiring gaze Upon the glory of her brow! Her eyes were like twin violets, The violets of the sunny South, Which dewy Morn delighted wets, And kisses with delicious mouth. Her cheek was paleâpale as the Moon, The young Moon of the virgin year, When night has pass'd its solemn noon Ere in the East her rays appear. Her rosy mouth was like a bud Full of the balmy breath of May; Her voice was like a summer flood That softly winds its gentle way;â Its sound to memory's ear will start Like to a sweet, forgotten tune, Whose echoes live within a heart That when it loves forgets not soon. XXV.âSONG OF A SEA FAIRY TO A LAND FAIRY. Come unto our coral caves, Where no winds of winter blow, But the smoothly-gliding waves Like the songs of summer flow! We have many a pearly shell Where you may in splendour dwell, Safe as in the perfumed chamber Of the lily or red rose, And be fair and sweet as those. We have paths, too, paved with amber; And your tiny feet may tread On golden sands unto your bed, Or on thickly-sprinkled pearls, White as teeth of fairy girls In their tender virginhed. Grots we have of shining spar, Light as lit with moon and star,â Vast of arch and high of dome, Where the Triton-people come To disport in halcyon seas, And indulge such joys as please Creatures made for careless ease. Comeâby this they have begun; For the wan, way-wearied Sun Turns the beauty of his smile From the green hem of your isle. Faster than his smile doth fade Comes black Night, with cloud and shade Dusking half the world, whilst he Along the silent, shining sea, Wafted in the sea-horsed car Of the great Jove of the deepâ Sedge-haired Neptune,âstill doth sweep With swift wheels adown the steep And rounding waters, to the far Unseen chamber of his rest In the day-delighting East,â There to pause until the call Of Hesper, coming from the hall Of the young, impatient Day, Bids him take his wonted way Through the bright arch which doth span Wider than the eye of man Can o'er-measure, though it strain Over the wide earth and main! Come, ere yet his westering wheels Dip in the gold-sprinkled sea, And lewd Night, like Comus, reels From his dark lair lustfully!â We have fields of emerald-green, Such as are by seamen seen When they plunge into the sea, In their sick-brained fantasy, Dreaming they once more behold Home-fields spread with flowers of gold. Ours are fields where many a flower Blooms and fears no season's power, And eternally is fair Though your Sun shines never there. Shut in darkness while your day Wastes with wearying hours away, Soon as they behold the Moon Wandering forth to hear the tune Of Nightingale by waters near Warbling to the still Earth's ear,â Quick, to please their patroness, (Who has deign'd their lives to bless With a beauty far more fair Than your flowers of earth and air, Nurturing them with milder beams As devoted to her streams,) Then they spread beneath her eye Like a flowery galaxy. Come, and think not our sea-life One of terror, storm, and strife!â We have sports on rock and strand Vying with your nights on land: Wafted now by the curlew Over isles and waters blue, Merrily we sweep along, Listening to the mermaid's song; Now with dolphins bound and gambol; Now on sedgy sea-banks ramble; Now creep into flaws and chinks Of the fire-rent rocks and brinks That precipice the toppling isles Standing on volcanic piles, Under which run pillar'd halls, Built for our fairy festivals. In the wide sea-vales and plains At the foot of our sea-mountains, Fresh, sweet springs, like crystal veins, Sparkling rise in sprinkling fountains. There you may new flowers behold Which our Spring has dropt with gold, Others shining through our day With a silvery star-like ray, Making every step you tread Bright, and soft, and essencÃ¨d;â Water-daisies, white as stars, Giving lustre to the spars That, when Neptune is a-bed, Light his sea-cave overhead;â Lilies, snowy as thy hand; Violets, sweet as those on land, And as delicately blue As the fair veins running through Thy white brow, that whitest wonder!â Vales, among whose verdant weed Harmless creatures sport and feed, Where, indeed, no monstrous thing,â Dolphins, rudely gamboling; Rough sea-lions, roaring thunder; Slimy serpent and sleek seal; Savage sea-wolf; biting eel; Crocodiles, which covert keep, Dealing death when feigning sleep; Water-throwing whales, that make Ocean vibrate like a lake; Crafty sharks, that slily steal To their savage, sudden meal; Wild sea-horses, spurning strong The sands, as fierce they scour along, Till the chafing waters foam,â None of these will rudely come In the pearly paths which lead To your coral cell, or tread Where your feet will ever stray, To affright you, night or day. Nothing noxious there shall move, Only such things you may love: Timid mermaids, perhaps, may there Comb the pearls from their sleek hair, And, remote from rude alarms, Nicely dress their human charms;â These are Ocean's gentle daughters, And disturb not its still watersâ Waters clear, of cleanly tide, Through whose depths may be descried All the stars which course the sky, All which stand there fixedly; All the curious water-forms, Sluggish shells and finny swarms, Every harmless thing that there May please, but not affright, my fair! Come, sweet Fay, and follow me To the deepest-sanded sea, Where you may by day conceal Charms you wish not to reveal, Safe among the sea-born droves As among a flight of doves, (Such as Venus, with much pains, More by love than luring, trains To teach her Loves their wingÃ¨d way From the groves of Paphia.) And when night grows dark again, And the Fairies' moon doth reign, And the dark Hours' lonely bird Over land and sea is heard, Creep from chamber of your house Until morning to carouse In the camp of Oberon, Till his nightly sports are done, And the first voice of the day Bids us to our home away! Come, and ask no more persuading! Every fay and fairy maiden Have by this their court begun,â Now the wan and weary Sun Bathes his brow in the fresh sea, Sinking there, and so must we;â See, the light-sail'd Nautilus Waits to be a barque for us; And the fays and fairies slim, From their halls in sea-shells hollow, Call us with their choral hymn, And a gentle whoop and halloo, Crying âFollow, fairies, follow!â XXVI.âTHE RED CROSS KNIGHT'S RETURN. A lover to his lady's bower With silent foot came softly stealing;â The dew was down on leaf and flower, And night and shade the world concealing; And to his lute he sang this lay,â âOh, Lady, list thy true Knight's 'plaining! The night is innocent as day, Where love, and love alone, is reigning.â The Lady from her lattice high Came stealing, too, with steps as soundless; She heard his song, and heard his sigh, Which told a taleâof passion boundless. And much she mark'd the gentle Knight Within her silent bower sighing, But knew not, in his warrior plight, The lord for whom her heart was dying. From open'd window low she lean'd, Whilst still he sang till near the dawning,â âLove never yet from darkness glean'd A thought which gave a blush to morning.ââ âAye, so thou sayest; but who art thou, That comest when good men take their slumbers? The stain of night is on thy brow, Which thy dark plume more deeply umbers.â âMy casque is doff'd!âdost know me now?â Ah! how thou lovedst me when we parted!ââ âI know thee notâbut this I know, My lord is with the Lion-hearted!â I tell thee, Knightâ(if thou art knight, And not some recreant, coward craven, That recks not who concludes the fight, So his poor single self be saven)â âMy lord is in the Holy Land, Where Richard's heart to war is beating; And while his good sword own'd a hand Would never outrun the retreating!â But thou art some soft, carpet-Sir, Who won his knighthood by his kneeling, Whose heel would tremble at its spur; A preux chevalier of the ceiling âThe flower of Knights at tournaments, Great arbiter of tags and laces, Of lutes and love-locks, gloves and scents; Preferring courts to leaguer'd places,â The glances shot from ladies' eyes, To arrows in the battle glancing; The light plume stirr'd by summer's sighs, To banner in the bold wind dancing; âThe losel's laugh and minstrel's lay, And tinkling harp high-tuned to pleasure, To trumpets' fury in the fray, Or war-shout set to rougher measure!â I know thee not, but, by my fai', By thy bold tongue, thou'rt some bad lover, Who would dare that by night, which day Would by its waking blush discover!â âVice, when it wears the mask of night, May look as fair as holy Virtue, But you discern, by day's true light, The fiend disguised, who came to hurt you! The hawk by night may woo the dove, And seem a doveâas true and tender, But with the light she knows her love, And seeks the dovecote to defend her.ââ âOh think not so, thou lady rare! The moon safe guard for us is keeping; And we may love's communion share While sensual souls are idly sleeping. Descend, my lady dear, descend! And where Love is be never fearful; Pure passion ne'er had sinful endâ No,âHeaven of lovers is too careful!ââ âI know thee not!âââOh say not so! Thy words descend like drops of sorrow;â Yet since thou wilt not thy love know, Thou shalt behold him on the morrow. May all good angels guard thy head, When softly sunk on slumber's pillow; But I shall lie on torture's bed, As restless as on ocean's billow.â They parted then: the morrow came, And to her bower a Knight came riding; She knew him, by his scarf of flame, To be her lord, and wept her chiding. âNow tell me, surly groom, now say, Is thy love-worshipp'd lady waking? And does she know this night's delay Weighs on my heart, as it were breaking? âTell her I come from the Holy Wars, With the scarf she bound about me, Unstain'd, unmaim'd by the Moslem scars, With my trophies round about me! My casque may wear the axe's dint Where four on one were plying; My breastplate show the arrow's print Where showers death-wing'd were flying;â âFor where the Lion-hearted led, There fought his faithful Paladin; And Paynim fell and Paynim fled, Till singly struck the Saladin! In Richard's sight for England's might My sword and battle-axe were wielded; For this I fought the Christian fight, Till not a Pagan foe but yielded! âThe Lion now walks Judah's plain, And scares the pale Mohammedan, Who both from fight and feast refrain, But the vultures keep no Ramadan! Now, England, all thy pennons wave, And shout with all thy bravery! Thy Richard comes, who went to save The Christian Freres from slavery! âJerusalem! Jerusalem! Oh joy to tell! oh joy to tell! Thy cross and thorny diadem Are rescued from the Infidel!â The red cross now o'er Judah floatsâ Like dust its foes are drivenââ Then went a shout from English throats, That shook the vault of heaven! âBut I am spent with toil on shore, And peril on the sea, And hopes of meeting those once more That are most dear to me.â Now tell me, surly groom, now say, Is thy love-worshipp'd lady waking? And does she know this long delay Weighs on my heart as it were breaking?â The Lady from her chamber came, And, weeping as she ran, embraced him: She knew him by the scarf of flame, And by the plumed helm that graced him. âOh droop not soâoh weep not soâ Thou art still mine and loyal-hearted!â We've parted once, but never mo' Shall our dear lives and loves be parted! âThen let the merry bells ring round, And the feast be largely given, For I am now on England's ground, The favour'd Knight of Heaven!â Let the priest wight by tapers' light Unite us sure as love would be; And be the glee sung, and the carillons rung, And the feast and the flask held merrily!â Through chapel throng Sir Priest did wade; A portly man was he: His chin was on his shoulder-blade, His belly on his knee. Down by his feet, on altar-stone, With hand link'd fast in hand, They knelt till holy rites were done, And bound the wedded band. Then loud the merry bells rang round, And largesse gold was given;â There was not Knight on English ground More nigh, I ween, to heaven!â And the priest wight, that very night, Was rosy as good priest should be; And the glee was sung, and the carillons rung, And the feast and the flask went merrily. XXVII.âLOVE TILL DEATH. Should Time, through avarice of such treasure, Steal the bright gold from every tress, Robb'd of their wealth, yet still with pleasure I would behold their snowyness,â Nay, love them, silver'd, grey, and cold, More than I prized their gloss of gold. Should Time find pleasure in slow stealing The rose that makes thy face so fair, No sigh of mine shall tell the feeling That sees young beauty fading there;â I'll love thee, love, till thou art dead, Let thy cheek's rose be white or red. Should Time o'ercloud thy bright eyes' beaming, And quench the fire their glance betrays, Though many now may win their gleaming, Be mine their last, dim, dying rays, And they shall light my life, till I Have lived enough, and willing die. Should Time succeed thy form in bending Into that stoop which tells of age, Yet shall I find some beauties, lending Grace to thy last steps on this stage, Where thou hast play'd thy happy part, Less by thy beauty than thy heart. Should Time e'er mar that voiceâ(as tender As harmonies of sweetest sound)â Into the trembling pipe and slender, In its own efforts feebly drown'd,â Yet would I have thy latest breath, When thou art whispering with Death. And when by Time thou art entombed, And none but Love remembers thee, Thenâmy poor light of life consumedâ In the same earth my home shall be; And on our stone these words be read,â âThey loved when livingâlove when dead!â XXVIII.âTHE OLD LOVE. 'Tis twenty winters since we met, And still I dream of thee; Though waking I awhile forget, Sleep brings thee back to me!â I see thee in thy beauty's prime, And not as thou art now,â Ere one long line of lengthening time Was traced upon thy brow. I see the summer of thy smile, The sunshine of thine eyes, And feel I am not old the while, And know no miseries!â The vision fliesâthy smile is goneâ I wake again to care, And loathe the day, whose sunny dawn More darkens my despair! If to mine eyes my feelings rush, And tearsâunmanly tears,â Again from this hard Horeb gush, The treasured grief of years,â 'Tis thou that bidd'st these waters flow; And if my tears condemn My manhood with this woman's woe, 'Tis thou should'st blush for them! But noâI will not think of blame,â I love thee still too well;â Be witness this poor wasting frame From fires unquenchable,â The thought of thee when wandering where My happy hours were pass'd,â The long, long groan when lingering there Where I beheld thee last! Ah, Mary! these are things which make My heart and spirit feel What I have suffer'd for thy sake, But for thy sake conceal!â Oh may no agonies like mine, That make the heart their prey,â No grief that makes the spirit pine, Wear thy dear life away! My name is perhaps forgotten now, And all I was to thee; But thine is written on my brow Deeplyâindelibly! The world may read no record there, And faithful friends, who think They know my heartâits sorrows share, Behold not that I sink;â Yet I am sinkingâto the grave,â Lone place, but one of rest; Where, when the yew and cypress wave Above my silent breast, And grey light lingers in the gloom, And solemn shadows flit Like mourning friends about my tomb, And evening hallows it,â There if, some time, with pilgrim feet Thou piously should'st stray, To dress my verdant winding-sheet, And keep the weeds away, My spirit, hovering overhead, Shall breathe about thee peace, And bless thy homage to the dead, And bid thy sorrow cease! XXIX.âTHE BROKEN HEART. Sister,âonly one befriending, Save with words of idle breath,â Sister,âonly one attending Sorrow's couch and sickness' death,â Lo, a day is newly breaking, Whose decline I shall not see; And thy lover's voice is waking Thee, who shunnest sleep for me!â Droop not, sister, and thy weeping For my fated end give o'er; Could it hinder death's dark sleeping, Thou should'st weep for me no more!â Mourn not!âdying is not dying Unto those who love not life, But a hope to the relying, And a glad release from strife,â Strife, that wears the human powers,â Strife, that hardens o'er the heart,â Strife, that crushes, in few hours, Hopes with which our heart-strings part. Who would cling to this poor being That has better hopes on high? Who would murmur when th' All-seeing Points the hour that we should die? Yes, it may be painful, leaving Life,âwhich should be only joy, But that passions interweaving With its hopes, its hopes destroy!â Dying for her, it may grieve me That she never lived for me; Yet when my last sigh shall leave me, 'Twill be breathed for none but thee,â Thee,âthe only one befriending, Save with words of idle breath,â Thee,âthe only one attending Sorrow's couch and sickness' death! Tell her, though for her I perish, That my wrongs I can forgive; And if thought of me she cherish, Let her think that still I live, Though my bones the while be rotten,â Dust among its fellow-dust, And who knew me have forgotten All save that which never must Perish with me, but, surviving, Give the life that outlives death,â Fame,âthe life of life,âwhich living, Crowns me with unwithering wreath!â Poor and living, she may scorn me; But when I am with the dead, And the rays of fame adorn me, Shame will fall upon her head, If she then despises, proudly, Lowly love and lofty fame; And the world shall murmur loudly Of my wrongs, and hate her name! Had I been a heartless wooer, And adored with feign'd excess,â Had she loved me warmer, truer,â Had I loved her wiser, less,â Then my life had not been blighted,â Then these griefs would not consume; And the vow she broke, though plighted, Had not struck me to the tomb!â Mine was kept, and only broken When my heart is broken too;â Witness these death-pangs as token Of a faith severely true! Hah! my blood is coldly welling In my heavy, sinking heart; And my soul is proudly swelling Upon wings which yearn to start! Yes, my heart at last is breaking, And thy cares will end with me;â I shall wing where no awaking Brings a morn of misery!â Hopes I had, high ones and many; Now, not one of earth is left; And my heart, once strong as any, Fate hath crush'd and falsehood cleft!â Joys were mine, most sweet and ample, Such as youth will ever have; Life had flowers, till she did trample All but those will dress my grave!â Who would cling to this poor being, That has better hopes on high? Who would murmur when th' All-seeing Wills, in mercy, we should die?â Droop not, sister, and thy weeping For my fated end give o'er; Could it hinder death's dark sleeping, Thou should'st weep for me no more!â Let me feel thy hands, in dying, Clasp my brow, which chills with death; Let me hear thy gentle sighing Mingle with my gasping breath!â And when silence seals for ever These true lips, do this by me:â Kiss and close them, for they never Parted without blessing thee!â And my harp,âwhose plaintive story Drew your innocent young tear,â Once my hope, my joy, my glory,â Lay it on its master's bier;â And when this poor dust you bury, Place it in this icy hand, Which among its cords would hurry, Waking, at its wild command, Songs of war, and sounds of clangor,â Lays that were my earliest lore,â Airs that soothed the rage of Anger,â But will never wake them more!â I ask of thee the yearly shedding. Of such flowers as sweeten Spring; Fall them light on my cold bedding, And heaven will bless the offering! Breathe there the hymn that bard, the dearest, Framed for lips as pure as thine; And if a spirit's sigh thou hearest, By its sadness know it mine! Sister, fail not to see duly All the rites I ask perform'd, Adding prayers from heart as holy As Religion ever warm'd. Droop not, sister, and thy weeping For my fated end give o'er; Could it hinder death's dark sleeping Thou should'st weep for me no more!â Sure some angel's arms entwined me! Or, my sister, were they thine?â Stillâoh still caressing bind me,â Let me in thy arms recline! Nearer, sister, nearerânearerâ Thou art all that's dear to me! Feel my heart's last beat, thou dearer Far than fame, and song, and sheâ Ah! I read I should not name her, In the anger of thine eye! Never, as thou lovest me, blame her,â Scorn should with forgiveness die!â No, my gentle sister, pardon All the wrongs which she has done; Scorn and condemnation harden Many a heart, but soften none! I was wrong, perhaps, to aspire To a lady proud by birth,â Daughter of a princely sire, Sprung from proudest of the earth;â But the wings of my ambition, Broken by too rude a blast, Teach me, in this low condition, What I really am, at last. Hush thee! There are angels winging Visibly within the room! Come to claim, with joy and singing, What is heaven's from the tomb! Hear'st thou not their heavenly voices, Which have taken tones like thine? My soul hears them, and rejoices With an ecstacy divine!â Lay me lightly on my pillow, With that gentleness thine own; I can die now calm as billow When the winds have dropt it down. All is past, and all forgiven!â If my hopes have any worth, We shall meet and love in heaven, Though we might not upon earth!â Nearer, sister, nearerânearerâ Thou art all that's dear to me!â Take my heart's last throb XXX.âFANCY'S HOME. My cot should stand in some lone dale; Its windows, brightening with the East, Should hear the wakeful Nightingale When every song but her's has ceased. And there should be, to hear it too, A heart all tenderness and truth, And eyes that shine like morning-dew, And lips of love, and looks of youth. My cot should have a garden-bower, With fruit and flowers, for bird and bee, To balm and freshen evening's hour, And fill the air with fragrancy;â And there my Mary's harp should ring Sweet tones that make the pulses thrill, The heart unconsciously to sing, And as unconsciously to still. A little lake, nor loud nor deep, Should from my door to distance spread, Where we might hear the light fish leap, Or see them nestle in their bed;â And it should sleep between two hills, Shut from the sweeping storm's career, Calm as the heart when laughter stills, And bright as joy's delicious tear. And there my little white-sail'd boat Should lie in golden-sanded cove, Or on the silver waters float, Freighted by Beauty and glad Love. And thus might we laugh, sing, and play, And let the months like minutes wing; And life be all a summer's day, And death a dark, but dreadless thing! XXXI.âSUMMER MORNING. Darkness,âthat was ere the Creator said âLet there be light,ââlook'd it,ââand there was light,ââ Flies fiend-like from the Sun, and as he flies, With dusky wings shadows the West with gloom,â And slow to leave a world once all his own, Lingers awhile along the forest's marge, Till Light comes rushing on, and drives him in. And now begins the glory of the day!â First, in pure worship, from small censers, swung By stirring airs and insects on the wing, A flower-born perfume, Nature's offering, spreads Rich incense 'round, fragrant and fit for heaven. The mists, which sometime veil'd the dawning day, Gather'd from woods and fells and watery vales, Surmount the hills, and, by the wind compell'd, Sweep like the robes of morning-startled spirits, And melt afar into the viewless air. And now with murmurous prelude softly swells The choral concert, varbling of the Morn. First, from all hedges, the strong sparrows chirp, And fluttering linnets pour their lively song. Weak-voiced, but sweet, the wren is twittering heard, Half-drown'd in depths of thickly-wooded brake. The bold, house-loving bird, the bird humane, Trills sonorous and loud his plaintive tones, In winter loved, in summer all forgot, A poet's fate!âThe chaffinch in high elm Pours his shrill-sweetness down;âthe throstle tries His low notes now, and now full-throated bursts Into his powerful eloquence of song, And now refrains, confiding in his strength. The blackbird next, from neighbouring wood's green brim, Pipes to his mates far off among the hills, And pauses oft to hear them answer him. The selfish cuckoo, solitary bird, In stealthy haunts deep-hidden, 'gins his call, Frequent and strong, and now again is still. Last sings, first voice of day, the lark,âlong waked, But soaring silently where furling clouds Roll red before the Sun;âand the full choir Complete, outbursts the general hymn of day! NOON. Earth now lies basking in the blaze of Noon, Stirless, and without shadow, stands the grove; No leaf, however light,ânot the frail aspen-leaf, Timorously trembling at the slightest breath,â Is stirr'd by wandering wind, or winging bird Rustling from branch to branch; for bird and wind Are still and resting now. The tall hedge-grass, Escaped the mower's scythe, droops motionless O'er the dull poppy, as its opiate fume Had drowsed it into sleep. The daisy, too, Wags not its crowned head, save when the bee, With tiring wing, alights upon its brow. The trailing bramble, that in summer swings And gambols with the wind, hangs dangling down From lofty bank, fast-rooted, o'er a rill Flowing as gently as an infant's breath. The wild-rose (emblem, and resemblance too, Of beauty without art,) breathing its faint, Delicious life, peeps thro' the hawthorn hedge, Half pale, half red, like pining beauty's cheek, And stirs not its own space. Motion has ceased! Silence, the teacher of deep thought, sits still In her lone haunt, the Man-deserted fields, Still as despairâpatient as love that pines, And voiceless as the grave. How hush'd and dread Lies the wide landscape, far as sight can see, Its silence stunning more than loudest sounds!â The heart shrinks sensibly, and feels the load Of thoughts which wear its morning strength away! The eye looks 'round, and meets no living thing; The ear would listen thankful to the sound Of anything that, stirring, stirr'd the air, Which sleeps as it were dead.âI am indeed alone! He who first wound through Eden's beauteous vales Felt not, nor was, so awfully alone; For unseen angels hover'd where he went, And wondering view'd the new-created Man, Walking in glory such as waits not now On creatures fallen without the wish to rise!â Oh for the sight of something that has lifeâ The humblest thing which men consider mean,â Though but a snail sliding his daily span; An insect glittering in the shiny sun; Adder or reptile, beetle or hated toad,â To break this death-like loneliness, and say I live where others live! I leave the wood, Retrace my way along the winding vale, And once more visit life. But all is stillâ Silent and sleeping still. No sound is heard, Not the brown cowfly's sullen, murmurous hum, Nor droning bee's, that labours long, yet sings, And so makes labour light; nor the shrill pipe Of teasing gnat, by tender ladies fear'd; Nor lengthen'd low of drouth-impatient kine, Calling the rain-clouds up, which will not sail Till the wind bids; nor cock's shrill crow, that counts The hurrying hours of day. The resting lark Covers some clover'd spot, or picks his meal At Nature's feet;âthe thrush is in the hedge, But all his joy is dumb;âthe cuckoo, too, That ever wanders with melodious voice, Now near, now far, in field, in brake, and wood, Has ceased his flute-like call. The playful lamb, That bleated ere the dawn, lies slumbering down By its cud-chewing dam. The sturdy ox Recumbent rests, deep ruminant. The steed (Through summer free to crop the paddock round, Till Autumn's horn call him a-field again, To chase the headlong deer and doubling hare) Lolls his long neck over the bolted gate Which shuts him in; and though from labour spared, Eyes the wide heath afar, where boundless range His freer mates; and though their hides ne'er shone Under the wisped hand and sleeking rub Of careful groom, with tuneless whistling soothed; And though their manes dangle unbraided, lank, And loose in airâtheir fetlocks stand untrimm'd, Hard their employ, more hard their food,âyet longs (If eyes can speak where language is denied) For their rude freedom, fellowship, and play. Nature, and her wild children, in this deep Sweet silence sleep, and are refresh'd. Meanwhile Her work goes on with no discernible pause More than is witness'd now. Fruits to the Sun, Like infants to their sire, turn their fair cheeks, And woo his parent kiss. Flowers unto him Pour the soft incense of their silent praise. The tender grain aspires to meet his beam, And whilst the green veins of the leafy world Shrink withering in his warmth, stands confident, And dares his sultriest shine. Rivers and rills,â That like to serpents through green sedges glide, Or wind unseen their noiseless way in wilds And sylvan shades,ârun from his searching gaze, And plunge still deeper into solitudes. The teeming Earth gapes wide with open veins, Thirsty with heat, yet still desiring more, That she may glut man's garners with her gifts, And fill the world with universal good. Soon as the solemn shades of evening sail, And Darkness spreads her curtain on the scene, A freshening sweat cools every verdant thing That fever'd through the day. Soon as the dawn Streaks beautiful the East, sweet slumber-drops, Countless as sands shored by the shrinking sea, Hang tremulous, and numerous as the leaves They dress with diamonds. But whether heat The verdant earth exhaust, and parch her veins; Or heaven-directed showers and earth-born dews Refresh her wasting bosom, still the work, The mighty work benevolent, goes on, Till Man and Nature, both, are satisfied. Oh holy Nature! if my humble hymn Might dare be heard warbling half tremulous In this most solemn silence of all sounds,â Here in this temple, fashion'd by His hand Who made and trusted this fair world to Thine, Should it be pour'd. Down, daring Pride! and hear Unheard, and learn! For hark! again thy choir. With various voice more worthy of Thine ear, Awakes the slumbering air, and me compels To wonder and unutterable praise. XXXII.âFAREWELL OF A PILGRIM FATHER TO ENGLAND. I've trod my last step on thy strand, And now am on thy wave, To seek a home in some far land, But haply find a grave! I reck not where my bones are laidâ Who wraps them in their sheet; I reck not where my grave is made, If trod by human feet. My mother, England, still thou art, And I would be thy son; But thou hast flung me from thy heart, With many a worthier one!â I love Thee, oh! too much to say, And like a lover yearn; For though I turn my eyes away, My heart I cannot turn! The sea runs high, the ship dips low, The wild waves overwhelmâ The crew are lash'd above, belowâ The helmsman to the helm;â Rage on, rage on, thou wreaking windâ Roll on, thou weltering sea; Ye cannot be more hard unkind Than man hath been to me! I heed not these rude tempest-gales,â Their rage will soon be spent, I heed not these storm-riven sails,â My heart is deeper rent! The storm will passâthe angry main Will know a day of calm, But who will make Thee whole again, And give thy wounds a balm? Thy sons were strong, and brave, and bold; Thou wert the Ocean's heart; But Power hath drain'd their veins for gold, And sapp'd Thy vital part;â They dare not think of what they were, Nor say what they would be; For England now herself doth fear, Who fear'd no enemy! Thy bow was strong at Agincourt, Thy lance did stain Poictiers,â Thy strength shall be a theme for sport, As now it is for tears. There's one, for wine, shall give Thee gall, And laugh at thy distress; And some shall triumph in Thy fall, Who fear'd Thy mightiness! Farewell! I cannot think of Thee, And feel no filial fear; I cannot dread what Thou may'st be, Without a shuddering tear. I weep not at the wreaking wind, Nor dread the awful sea, Though both are fell and hard unkindâ I weep and fear for Thee! XXXIII.âLIFE'S STAGES. Ill-omen'd were my early years, When motionless and calm I lay A little bark in home's safe bay, Though all without was stormy; For Misery look'd on me through tears, And pitying, wept them o'er me! Young boyhood should have been the spring Of life's few hopes:âits summer flowers Should then have budded;âbut the bowers My youthful hands with care had gather'd, With every hope and rapturous thing Which made them heaven-likeâwither'd! Then manhood came, and with it came Miseries undreamt of, and the dread That worse might come. On sickness' bed I sorrowing pined, and death's pale terrors Made life far worse than deathâtill blame Was drown'd in tears for all my errors. The pure, white hours of childhood fled, And boyhood's April-day of tears And spring-like smiles, whose hopes are fears,â Through manhood's prime with rapid pace The downward path of life I tread, But find not yet my resting-place. That stage comes nextâlife's mellow prime, Grave herald of that winter white We will not see, though to our sight As palpable as light of day,â Though on our brows the hand of Time Traces his silvery lines and grey! Last comes old age, when garner'd in Is all for which we groan and toil And weep and wish and careful moil And barter health and ease and sleep:â Oh take me, Heaven, whilst young in sin, If what youth sows old age must reap! XXXIV.âMEETING. The green leaves were searing, For Summer was gone; The corn of her rearing Stood brown in the Sun; The high lark was singing To Silence and Noon; The skies were all ringing Aloud with his tune,â When lonely I wander'd By Wye's winding stream, And pensively ponder'd Love's passionate dream. In the silence of Even I linger'd there yet;â The great light of Heaven In glory had set; One silvery star sparkling Look'd down through the night, And hush'd Earth lay darkling Till the Moon shed her light; A soft step then sounded, A shade cross'd the shine, Towards me it bounded,â And Mary was mine! XXXV.âRESENTFUL LOVE. I never saw a girl so fair, And never knew one so deceitful; And now I see her smile no more, I can perceive her heart is hateful!â Oh who could dream that underneath A face so serious-sweet and smiling The soul lurk'd darkly in deceit, And subtle spells, and serpent-wiling! The heart the fountain is of tears; But mine is waterless, and weeps not! One griefâthe grief of yearsâhas drain'd That human fountâa woe that sleeps not. The pain I bear is in my soul, Too dumb for speechâtoo proud for sorrow:â It plows my brow with silent share, But ah, with daily deepening furrow! The hope, the fear of years are pastâ The strife with fateâthe chill, the fever; The racking doubtâthe jealous care, Are gone at last, and gone for ever!â And love, and all it loved, is gone, And left of all its dreams no token,â Save this long dumbness of despairâ An early ageâa spirit broken! XXXVI.âRECOLLECTIONS. Now Day hath closed, and Night is nigh, The mournful Moon treads up the sky, And I with Evening sadly sigh In loneliness! The past I mourn with many a tear; The future has no hope to cheer; Death has no dread, but life has fear And misery! Yet though to lose the past I strive, The future I would gladly give, If that sweet time I might o'erlive As happily! For I should wake Love's harp again With heart as light as its wild strain, And she who is that heart's sole pain Would hearken it! And I should revel in her smile, And life's dark hours with her beguile, And trust again in that sweet wile Which did undo me! Heart-happy was I then;âbut now Care writes her thoughts on my young brow, And tears of anguish coldly flow In loneliness! XXXVII.âTHE PALADIN'S BRIDAL. It was a noble Paladin, New from the Holy Land, That at the shrine of St. Austin Resign'd his battle-brand; Sir Reginald, the Red Cross Knight, A man of iron limb, A lion in the Lion's Richard CÅur de Lion. sight, In courage conquering him. St. Austin's mellow matin-bell Had call'd but thrice to prayer, When at the Friar Francis' cell The Knight stood knocking there. âNow God thee save, thou holy Friar, And lend more grace to me! What! yet a-bed, when Austin's choir Is chanting piously?â The Friar from his few rushes rose, His senses still asleep,â For you might read in his red nose His vesper-draught was deep:â For more than service at the shrine, Or mass for parted souls, Good Francis loved the ruddy wine That laugh'd in losels' bowls. The rosy radiance that shone From forth his purple face Did indicate no holier one Than Bacchus' babe of grace. Nor did he care to mortify His carnal mass of man:â His soul once fix'd upon goose-pie, He reck'd not though the ban Of Church and Empire had been set Upon so gross a sin,â They would not his devotion let, Till appetite gave in. His belly, when he sat at board, Bulged far beyond his knee With what his flock could well afford From bin and buttery: For, when they wish'd to be forgiven, A haunch of forest deer Made wide the narrow way to heavenâ At least for half a year; And widen'd, too, that holy man With many a plumping pound,â So that his soul was but a span, His body five feet round. âNow, save thee, Son! now save thee, Son! What is thy will with me? If 'tis to beg my benison, I give it willingly.ââ âI thank thee, Father; but I came To sin, and not to shrive!â Friar, I love a noble dame, Whom I am vow'd to wive. âThe war upon the Infidel That mock'd the Holy One, St. George be praised! hath ended well, And fight and field are won! My mail hangs now upon the wall, My sword lies on the shrine I snatch'd it from at Richard's call To arm for Palestine! âAnd now that War hath done with me, And I have done with War, I would not a vile losel be, And shame this sacred scar!ââ âGramercy, Sir! the holy rite Becomes the good Knight well,â Else should we lack new men of might To crush the Infidel!â âWhere is the lady, valiant Son? Right thankful shall I be To see thee wed some proper one, Of grace and good degree.ââ âWhere is the lady!âturn thine eye On something like the dawn, When thro' the starry galaxy Walks forth the radiant Morn! âThe light thou seest is not the sky's,â Noâfrom a heaven as pure, The heaven on earth of her fair eyes, It shines, my cynosure!â That music sounding nigh and nigher, Think not it is the call To matinals at Austin's choir,â It is her foot's soft fall! âShe comes!âbehold how like the swan She swims the amorous air, That kisses where and when it can, And wantons with her hair!â What takes thine eye? what thrills thy heart? What marvel lifts thy brow?ââ âOh, Son, that thou Friar Francis wert, And Friar Francis thou!â âGo, get thee holy walls within, For, till the rite is said, Each look of thine is like a sin Done to that sacred Maid!â An angel mingling among men Met in the house of prayer, Ne'er raptured more the eyes, than when That Lady enter'd there, And with soft glide of solemn grace, And downward-bending eyne, The saint and seraph in her face, Pray'd onward to the shrine. Religious men, as on she stept, Forgot the counted beadâ The sin for which but now they weptâ The grace which they did need;â And as at day's delicious rise The Ghebir worshipper Turns to the Sun with reverent eyes, So their's did follow her!â But she, unconscious of their gaze, Her thoughts with God alone, Bow'd down her heart in prayer and praise Before his holy throne; On humble knees, where beadsmen knelt, A lazar by her side, Paid the pure homage which she felt, And crucified her pride. The silver censers fuming waft Their solemn fragrance 'round, While warbling lutes and voices soft, And tinkling citherns sound. The Benediction!âmass is done, The reverend rite is paid:â âThou Red Cross Knight, come forth, good Son, Come forth, thou pious Maid!â The Knight up by the altar stood, And like an oak stood he;â Like whitest lily of the wood, Which droops in modesty, The gentle Lady lean'd on him,â It was a sight to see, For though her eyes that hour were dim, Her cheek bloom'd rosily. It was like heaven to behold That honourable Dame!â Loose hung her hair of radiant gold, And veil'd her virgin shame. Her smile was like a morn in Spring, A rosy morn in May, When Darkness folds her sable wing, And smiling breaks the day. A beautiful simplicity, That like a nestled dove Lay in her bosom, which no eye Could look on and not love;â A silent music, felt, not heard,â The harmony of grace;â A voice that warbled like a bird In a sweet summer place;â A speaking silence in her look;â A colour,âlike the streak Of rosy dawn seen in a brook,â Soft shining through her cheek;â The light and lustre of her eyes, Which shed their own bright day,â These mark'd her born for other skies, And soon to pass away! They knelt upon the sacred stone Where good St. Austin gave His soul unto the Holy One, His body to the grave; And there with Love's religious rite, And hands in blessing laid, The Lady took her loyal Knight, The Knight his lovely Maid. Then spread a joy, more deep than loud, Throughout that holy place!â The men of their brave lord were proud; The women loved the grace And beauty without beauty's pride Of Lady Madelon, And wish'd no other for his bride Than that belovÃ¨d one. What cry is that, so long and loud, Which shrills the chapel 'round? Who madly rushes through the crowd, And gathers from the ground That Lady, beautiful and wan, Clay-cold and motionless, Dead in his graspâher spirit gone In that last wild caress?â âOh holy Austin, save us all!â Prays loud the reverend man, And lets the marriage-missal fall From out his lifted han'. The crowd, too, swarming on each side, Recoil with shuddering thrill, With their own terrors terrified, And cross themselves from ill. Had the gaunt King of Phantoms, Death, Uncall'd stood threatening there, They could not breathe with less of breath, Nor whiten more with fear. âWhat awful spectre thing art thou? On what dread errand come? The brand of Fate is on thy browâ Thy look is of the tomb!â âIf thou dost gasp with human gasp, And wear a human heart, Let loose that victim from thy grasp, And tell me who thou art,â If manâor some fierce kite of hell, That through the air of day Dares swoop where God and good men dwell To tear my dove away!â âBewray thyself, or by this arm, Which never fail'd me yet, I will revenge this devilish harm, Or die where we have met!â For wherefore, wherefore, should I live, Since all the life of life The Saints could in their goodness give Lies murder'd in my wifeâ âAll, all I loved and lived for here,â What can I do but die?â He falters, for the sudden tear Springs to his eagle eye;â 'Tis gone, and from the trembling hand Of a young henchman by He snatches quick a deadly brand, And fronts him furiously. The crazÃ¨d man disparts his vest, And smiles, but answers not; And on the centre of his breast, Behold a starry spot!â It is the brave Sir Lionel, A kinsman to the Knight,â Long lost among the Infidel, Now come to claim his right! Three years like ten a captive he In Ascalon has been, In chain'd and scourged servility To heathen men unclean; And comes in rags and wretched guise, Who went in glittering mail, A man of many miseries, Lean, phantom-like and pale. Now, who that knew and looks on him, So pined and early old, Would see, in wither'd frame and limb, The young, the brave, the bold,â The lightest heart in hall or bower, The loved and envied then,â The star of Chivalry,âthe flower Of England's mighty men!â They shrink from himâbut not in scornâ In tears they turn away, To see a creature so forlorn, So grisly, wan, and grey. His long, long death to brave renown, That pride of his spring years; His martyr-pangs without their crown; His sorrow without tears;â The solitude of day and night, When through its silence came Home-visions on his blinded sight, And sounds which breathed his name;â And tones of home's sweet melodies Rang through his living tomb; And shades he loved repass'd his eyes, To darken more its gloom;â And she that should have been his bride, With looks remember'd well, By fancy conjured up, would glide In beauty through his cell;â Theseâthese have made him the crazed thing They pity and yet dread,â Have sent his reason wandering, And bow'd his noble head. None speak to himânone think of force, They let him have his way; And still he clings to her cold corse, And staggering stands at bay. Hand there is none that stirs to touch That man of sorrowsâno, They pity him, so changed, too much, And sanctify his woe. For all had thought him with the dead, And some who saw him fall Sad masses for his soul's rest said, And on his castle wall His knightly shield and banneret Were hung in mournful wise, And lord and vassal sorrowing met To grace his obsequies. That Lady, lying cold and dead, Who loved him, oh too well! Had plighted holy troth to wed This young Sir Lionel. When tidings from the Holy Land Told that in mortal fight He fell death-wounded, sword in hand, In Lion Richard's sight, Three years she gave to grief and him, To piety and prayer, Till her bright beauteousness grew dim With melancholy care. Then came Sir Reginald Seygrave, A nobler Knight was none,â Wise, comely, generous and brave, He wooed her and he won. Sir Lionelâone groan he gives, And he is silent now; His flickering flame of life still lives, But death is on his brow. A tear hangs trembling on his cheekâ It fallsâhis heart is dry;â His spirit is too worn and weak For deeper agony!â He lifts his wither'd arm on high, And waves it once in air, With wild and melancholy cry Of laughter and despair; And not one there but shudders cold And feels his warm blood stand In icy horror, to behold Him reft of his right hand, And maim'd, and scarr'd, and mutilate In limb, and trunk, and tongue; And not a heart but leaps, in hate, To be those fiends among, The savage-natured Saracen, And, one in front of two, Show what the rage of English men In his revenge could do! A gurgling groan,âa shrieking cryâ A glance which strikes aghast All those who meet his gazeâa sigh, And all his pangs are past!â They raise them up, that maiden fair, That noble man and brave;â And where they died, the good monks there Resign them to the grave. Sir Reginald survived that scene, But fled the haunts of men;â A change came o'er his mind and mien,â He went, no one knew when;â His sword was missing from the wall, His true dog from the door, His barb was taken from the stall, And he was seen no more. XXXVIII.âINVOCATION TO SLEEP. Why dost thou shun me, Sleep? when half the world From night to day unconsciously are whirled As earth turns in its sphere?âwhen as it seems Men lie in slumber, or disturbed in dreams, That are a part, and not the worst, of sleep Which in that wakeful death some mortals reap? Oh Sleep unkind!âthou comfortable nurse Of human life, sweet sister of its curse, Terrific Death, king of the human dead,â Why hast thou shunned this night the lowly bed Of him who would prefer to feel his brow Bound by thy poppy-crown, than circled now With Fame's undying wreath; or coronal Such as some shepherd youth makes king in all The simple sports that grace the village green, Set on his head by flowery May's sweet queen, Crowning with honour some supreme exploit In sinewy wrestling, race, or far-hurled quoit?â Last eve, thou badest me to thy modest bed, And I obedient went. My throbbing head Lay on my pillow balm unblest. In vain With wearying tongue and overtaskÃ¨d powers Did I invoke thee here. Night, with her train, Her sombre train, of silent-passing Hours, With wings of raven-black, deep darkness cast Over the earth, as lingering slow they past Like day's funereal pomp. Where wert thou fled, Oh Sleep? why gone? with whom low-palleted?â Was it with Penury on his dunghill straw, Ill-lodged in walls pervious to Winter's flaw? With toil-worn warriors, on the tentless ground After the sanguine fight reposing sound, Though pillowed cold upon their comrades dead? With wan, worn Pain on his Procrustean bed? With the pined lover, pale, half-crazed, abject? Or with watch-wearied mariners, wrecked, While deep they slept, by some uncharted rock, On which their fragile bark beat with rebounding shock? The murderer sleeps; and he who dies to-day Rests through the night, borrowing, that debt to pay, (His term of tears in few, brief hours expired) Sufficient life, in thy soft arms acquired, To meet with strength the mightier force of Fate. The beggar, huddled in the rich man's gate, He woos thee not, nor does thy coming wait: Thou'lt go to him, and kiss his eyes that weep, And bless his sorrows with a senseless sleep;â And though his blood is coldâhis scrip is scant, Lend dreams of comfort, and no dream of want:â Whilst I with fruitless prayers implore thee still, (Upon a couch which Winter cannot chill, Nor conscience point with pain,) as was thy wont, To steep my senses in thy balmy font, And wash remembrance off. Yet thou, strange Queen Of night and silence, hast a truant been From my warm bed, as Crime had burrowed there, Or hepeless Grief, or still more hopeless Care!â Yet if thou dost the starved and wretched tend, And stealest to sick men's beds a ministering friend, Calming their souls, racked with long inward strife, Shedding thy Gilead balms on dying life, That, like a flickering lamp, but needs this oil To brighten into light, gaunt Death despoil For some few hours of his eventual prey, And add to life, too short, another day,â For these sweet acts of kindness heaven-humane, Though I for lack of thee were panged with pain, No word of blame shall 'scape my murmuring tongue; For I am not like these, though once as wrung With grief as they, and plunged below the care Of Heaven in the tenth wave of misery and despair! Thou shalt be chid as mother chides her child; As sisters blame a brother when too wild; As jealous lover chides his lady-love; As true dove chides his truant turtle-dove; As whispering winds the smooth Sicilian deep:â For I would win thee back, oh timid Sleep, Not drive thee hence by boisterous words and bold, And make thee distant as thou now art cold. Come hither, Sleep, as was thy wont of yore, In youth, which life sees once, and sees no more,â In youngest youth, that careless, pleasant prime, (Whose hours have wings soft with the down of Time,) Which, spent too soon, to purchase age and pain, We vainly wish that dove might come again, As to the ark that wandering bird returned With the green branch of hope for which the good man yearned. Then, in those healthy hours, all unaware I've found me in thine arms, sunk down from chair (For fireside warmth placed snug in chimney-nook) Whilst poring drowsily the holy book, In sullen silence eyed, with glancing look Thrown sly asquint on task-untroubled elf Happier than Iâdelighted with himself, More with his toy, which, as it hummed about With giddy reel, was hailed with happy shout. Then, if I nodded when thy summons came, Some petulant nurseâtoo seldom slow to blameâ With words, harsh words, loud as a bellman's din, Startled light slumber off, as sleep were sin. To break the web, which broke soon knits again, (That filmy warp which winds 'round dreamer's brain,) If gentler granddam came, with voice all old, And tottering step, and shrivelled fingers cold, Vain was the shake she gave with tremulous hand, Whistled in ears which heard not her command;â Much might she strive to chide, but more she strove To hide with frowns the breaking smile of love. Yet thou wouldst come and come in their despite, And make thine arms my bed ere fall of night, Though I would shake thy poppies from my brow, And force thy fingers from my lids. But now,â When youth's brief day is in its eve, and Care Has ploughed my forehead with sharp, gradual share, And early sown the seeds of sorrow there,â To fly me now when thou art needed more Than light to seamen on a stranger shore,â To shun the tumult thy calm hush should sooth, And leave the pillow thy soft hand should smooth,â How, when I think of this, can I but blameâ How with my former fondness can I name, Thee, sovereign Sleepâsole minister of rest, Waving thy wand till noise is all suppress'd, But in thine office partial and untrue, Giving to some much more than is their due, Whilst to their fellow-men thou darest deny Thus in this wakeful death their hour to die! Yet, though forsaken, still I woo thee, Sleep; For to all studious wights (who couchless keep Through lingering night in a poetic swoon With some belaboured sonnet to the Moon) I know thou 'rt coy. With lover's softened speech Breathed in his mistress' ear, I thee beseech To lap me in unconsciousness, and lay Me, weary of slow night, on thy smooth couch till day! If thou dost hear, come from thy silent halls, Where no thing stirs with noise, and no foot falls, Nor sound is heard loud as a gnat's low hum! If thou dost hear, to him who calls thee come, Though he invoke thee with no louder breath Than some have called thy readier brother, Death!â But ah! thou shunnest eyes that seldom steep In dews Lethean, but watch, and anxious weep Hot, painful tears in full and frequent showers!â Thou lovest brows less marked than mine, and lids That knit as lightly as the lids of flowers;â Him most thou fliest who most thy presence bids,â Contrary thingâunfixed as Love, unkind As Hateâas both jealous, and deaf, and blind; False as the fickle windânow here, now gone; Constant to many, but untrue to one; Now all consent, and now as Beauty coy,â That wilt not bed with Grief, nor with her sister, Joy! Oh ever-willing bride of Youth; Death's fair And beauteous counterfeit; calmer of Care; Young comforter of Age; soft-handed friend, Who wilt uncalled the couch of misery tend; Love-patient nurse of puling infancy, Watching their swinging cots, hushing their cry, Oft as they wake from some delusive dream Of plenteous founts pouring a milky stream;â Fastener unheard of dormitory doors, Lest some rude step should tread thy rush-strown floors; Queller of revels and vociferous joys; Sealer of lips of shrews and garrulous noise; Lightener of heavy hearts and laboured limbs; Hearkener to vesper-bells and evening-hymnsâ To pillow-prayers, faint-muttered, incompleteâ And dreams of nuns, pining in shut retreat; Freer of him whose day is one long groan, Fast, with short chain, linked to some dungeonstone; Listener to secrets which corrode the breast,â Murder and spoil, to thee alone confess'd In broken tales told with imperfect words;â Oh healthiest bracer of the slackening cords That bind the impatient, ever-fluttering soul To this dim cell of earth, this prison-hole! Oh universal Sleep!âbest good to bad and good; Thou general blessing, friend, physician, food; Samaritan, whose balm lulls every pain; Best wine for wounded heart and troubled brain; Mind's meat of misery, death between day And dayâlisten, oh angel Sleep, whilst pale I pray Thy coming here, by all those poets' lays, Famous and deathless, anthemed to thy praise; By every bud, twined with their living bays, Of thy flush poppy, drowsiest of flowers; By all chaste sleepers in thy silent bowers; By the first slumberer, Adam, when his eyes Waking to love, and beauty, and surprise, Saw Her who perfected his paradise; By Milton's sleep (him of the mighty hand, That struck the harp of Heaven) in Tuscan land, On silver Arno's shore, where Beauty cast Admiring eyes on him as on she pass'd, And in that moment lost her life of heart; By Lucrece' ravished rest; by Richard's start From the king-haunted bed; by Juliet's sleep Intranced and death-like, pale, and cold, and deep; By the observÃ¨d sleep of Imogen; By the clown's charmÃ¨d sleep, when FaÃ«ry's queen Grew amorous of the Athenian artisan, That centaur-loveâhalf asinine, half man;â By these, and numerous more, I invocate Thy presence here, ere yet it be too late, Thou froward friend, coy spirit, wingÃ¨d good, Dove of sweet peace, loving unroused to brood; Thou sometimes friend and sometimes foe to men, That fliest when thou should'st stay, and lingerest when Thy wings should wagâhear my true vow to thee, That in my wreath of fame thy flower shall blended be! In this sixth hour, which darkness yet doth keep Unrightfully from day, delight might leap From thy forsaken couch and darkened room, And into morning-fields in earliest bloom Rush breathless to inhale a balmier breath, And wear the rose of life on cheeks half-stained with death. But Winter, lover of thy lengthened night, Thy rest, and kindliness, and long respite From chilling airs, and gusty winds that blow Thick, changeful intermittences of snow And binding frost, sharp sleet and bounding hail, Various or mixedâ(yet each and all still fail, Single or mingled, Man, that fretful thing, To please, and quell his mutinous murmuring)â Winter forbids this joy,âto hail the morn When dews hang tremulous on leaf and thorn, And green bowers ring with most harmonious noise,â A pleasant joy worth all life's lesser joys, Which we with long, slow winter-miseries earn,â A happy time, for which I restless yearn More than sick seaman in the calenture, When, with deluded eyes, too blind for cure, In the wide world of waters of the sea He dim descries green valley, pleasant lea, Fields flowered and fresh, and hears the hum of bees, And linnets warbling soft on shadowy trees, And mad for land, with loud exultant rave Leaps to that fancied shore, and finds a watery grave. But for thee, Sleep, and thy strange waywardness, What visions might have come this night to bless! I perhaps had dreamedâ(what will not Fancy fling Across that glass that takes of every thing Some shadowy semblance, which, soon gone, gives place To the next shadow,âa scene, a flower, a face Too beautiful to love, which we behold With reverence like awe; a form, whose mould Might make the sculptor, though Praxiteles, Pound his proud works to dustâsuch images As make and mock the curious mind of Man)â I perhaps had dreamed of scenes Arcadian In that short time soon fled, the golden age, Ere shameful Vice usurped this stainÃ¨d stage. Had wound through sacred Tempe's sylvan vale, Where the great spirits of the past, at pale Of eve, still sorrowing glide, and wonder where All the old gods are gone who harboured there And filled it once with mysteries wild and strange;â Scenes which all-changing Time too soon did change! Perhaps, too, unseen, had crossed the midwood way (When shadowy night darkened the winging day) Of Comus, issuing to his orgies lewd, With monstrous crew of Bacchants, drunken-rude And reeling 'round their sensual god, with pipe, And shameful dance, and hiccupped hymn, as ripe As Circe's son for any game that sprang:â Had heard, appalled yet pleased, the deafening clang That from the forest's core through avenues And paths thick-tangled with long branch and briar Rang as if Hell itself had issued loose, And its damned spirits, in shrill-sounding choir, Shouted their horrid joy that they were free! âHad marked their hideous rout and revelry, As slow they wound their sinuous way, to where In jungle deep they met the tiger's glare;â Driving foul Darkness from her midnight wood, And brutal things that in the twilight brood, With flaring torches and far-streaming brands Held with loose recklessness in savage hands (That knew not what they did, nor cared to know, Though their brute wassail laid the world's woods low,) Till half the forest like a meteor blazed, And earth looked troubled, and the heavens amazed. âHad haply seen, all unbeheld the while, The charmÃ¨d cup (brimmed with some vintage vile, Dangerous to Virtue in that tempter's hand) Dashed down to earth, ere he, persuasive, bland, And serpent-tonguedâwily and wise, but lewd, Had time to press that luscious draught, hell-brewed, To her sweet lip, pure as her soul within From any stain of guilt or sensual sin. Under the wide-winged Night, had trod unseen Though close-companioned with those brothers twain Seeking their sacred sister through a night Dark as its deeds of lewdnessâby no light More lustrous lit than glowworm's little ray, Yet, bright within, found through the woods their way, Fearing no harm themselves, but dreading lest Some devilish hand, foul with sin's leperous pest, Might seek to soil her soul. And so had lent Attentive ear to their long argument, Warm, high, and wise, and beautiful as true,â What Virtue by herself herself can do; Though all the Powers of Sin should her assail, Nor one nor all against her could prevailâ Safe in herself, she might all hell restrain: This, starry BoÃ¶tes, wheeling his slow wain Along the plains of heaven, halted to hear, Whilst the celestial few that to this sphere Each night come down from heaven to minister To Virtue's good when Virtue is in need, Won by Truth's holy voice, shut without stir Their wafting wings, to hear young Wisdom breed In younger Doubt now silence and now praise Of pure Philosophy, of power to raise The animal Man from wallowing all his time In sensual sty, delighted with its slime, Exalt his soul above its base abode, And in conception make him like a god! And but for thee, coy Sleep, I perhaps had flown From earth's low fields to worlds and fields unknown, With fire-eyed Fancy in her wingÃ¨d car, Up-travelling high and higher, until that star Nearest and first-discerned had seemed as far And dim-discernible as heaven from earth; And so had heard the Immortals, in their mirth, Singing with silvery voices unto lyres Strung by the hymner Praise with golden wires Perfect in harmony. And next had seen Beings unknown to man,âof form and mein Fairer than fairest thing which here we see,â Of beauty far too beautiful to be Moulded and made of earth. Had walked with them The world-wide road to heavenâroad with rich gem, And gold, and silver powdered, whose bright dust, The Northern Lights. Stirred by their feet springing to playful joust, Some northern shepherd, on the bleak-aired height Tending his wandering flock, sees with affright, And dreams ere day of hell-rained fire a flood, Of wasting wars, and waters turned to blood, Of Ruin trampling audibly and near, With every direful ill which men and nations fear. But hence, false Sleep! I scorn thy coming now; For lo! the grey-eyed Morn, whose brightening brow One star sole gilds, and that of lessening ray, Gently awakes, and wakes the tardy Day; Whilst every thing of life which death-like sleeps, But with death's semblance life more living keeps, Shakes off the dewy bands which Sleep did bind All nature in, with carefulness most kind, And finding life once more, that gracious gift Is theirs for one more day, their eyes uplift To heaven, if not their hearts, and mutely praise Him who alone can make our years as days, Our days as yearsâwho numbers out the sands Which through our life-glass run with even handed hands. Warmer and warmer grows the opening East With gradual rays, which usher in that guest Our world's best visitor, come to dispense Life, health, and food, and fair intelligence; While Darkness, like a guilty creature, crawls Through sombre woods, and by old abbey walls, Back to his lightless home,âsome world undone, Barred from all light of heavenâfrom cheerful Sun, Mild-beaming Moon, and many-twinkling starâ And every orb of light that shines afar, And, mingling beams, commix that blaze of light Which burns through day, and mildly fires the night. Fast comes the dayâthe day for which I yearn! Like startled deer, couched on the dewy fern, Light my heart leaps and my sunk spirits rise! Oh not more welcome broke the day on eyes Of him, long darkling from deprivÃ¨d sight, Who felt the gradual dawn and day of light, When He who made the darkness and the day Touched his closed lids with finger salved with clay, Than dawns thy morn, all-worshipped Sun, on me, Wan with this vigil lone, and Sleep's inconstancy! As that famed stream, which hides its infant spring In lands remote from human wandering, Grows with the year, and from its natal bed, The Hercules of waters, lifts its head, Till the prayed blessing its old bound o'erflows, And full fruition follows where it goes,â So comes the Light from its mysterious source, Floods the dark world, and fructifies its course, And where it spreads, like Nile's parental ooze, Life, hope, and health, with sylvan wealth, diffuse. The rising hills first greet its golden beams, The valleys now, and now the glossy streams. The woods, that winter's blasts have failed to bare, And forests hoar, the general glory share: Their withered leaves a withered beauty shedâ The sered more yellow grow, the red more red; Whilst silver-firs and hollies ever green With emerald glances light the lustrous scene. And now 'tis day!âand not a stain of night Dapples the westâfair as the east with light. Darkness is gone, with all her solemn train Of swarthy Hours, across the western main: The dawn-bred mists and shadows, both, have flown; And see! the Sun fast showers his glory down, Till light and rosy radiance shine around, And fill the wondering soul, and wake the thought profound! Hail, holy Light! that comest with silver flood To glad the earth and gratify the goodâ To drive the ruffian from his darkling trade, And wake the honest, who with loom and spade Weave the warm web and delve the pregnant ground. Alreadyâhark!âthe miller's wheel whirls round, And his loud song in louder noise is drowned. The shepherd boy, who stirred with morning's star, Unfolds his ravening flock, and drives afar Where verdure lives though scanty Winter reigns,â To sheltered hills and pasture-cultured plains. The woodman, too, with sturdy step and slow, Winds to the wood, to lay its lofty low. The rural life is stirring everywhere; And sounds of summer murmur through the air! One voice aloneâsweeter than oaten flute, Or lover's passion melting o'er his luteâ One rural sound and song alone is mute:â The Lark, the wakeful usher of the dawn, Pours no high orison, nor welcomes Morn. The Robin only, of the summer throng, Trills with short intervals his plaintive song;â Pleased with all seasonsâautumn, winter, springâ He sings through all, and gives them welcoming!â So should the Poet's serious anthem rise With holy airs and solemn symphonies, Whether the gladdening Spring and Summer reign, Or raging Winter desolate the plain; In forest bare as in the clustered bower, His various voice should hymn the varying hour. Seasons may change, and with them change the song, But full the tide of praise should pauseless pour along Jan. 31, 1817. SONNETS. I.âJANUARY. Cold January comes in Winter's car, Thick hung with iciclesâits heavy wheels Cumbered with clogging snow, which cracks and peels With its least motion or concussive jar 'Gainst hard hid ruts, or hewn trees buried far In the heaped whiteness which awhile conceals The green and pastoral earth. Old Christmas feels,â That well-fed and wine-reeling wassailer,â With all his feasts and fires, feels cold and shivers, And the red runnel of his indolent blood Creeps slow and curdled as a northern flood. And lakes and winter-rills, impetuous rivers And headlong cataracts, are in silence bound, Like trammelled tigers lashed to th'unyielding ground. II.âFEBRUARY. The robin now, by hungry want made bold, Flies the bare fields of grainless, leafless dearth, For where fat Plenty doth unloose his girth;â The wood-owl hoots from his obscure, lone hold;â The cattle moan and tremble in the fold;â The dog, that crouches on the blazing hearth, Shivers to hear the bellowing winds' wild mirth;â The snows melt gradually; the rains beat cold, Yet soften the froze soil for furrowing plough;â The faint, love-breathing voice of young-eyed Spring Calls to the Nymphs, who stir in their oaks now At the first woodlark's wilder carolling;â And Culture prunes the old and youngling trees, Whether excrescent, rude, or maimed by snow or breeze. III.âMARCH. Like as that lion through the green woods came, With roar which startled the hushed solitudes, Yet, soon as he saw Una, that white dame To Virtue wedded, quieted his rude And savage heart, and at her feet fell tame As a pet lamb,âso March, though his first mood Was boisterous and wild, feeling that shame Would follow his fell steps, if Spring's young brood Of buds and blossoms withered where he trod,â Calmed his fierce ire. And now both violets Breathe their new lives; the tawny primrose sits Like squatted gypsy on the wayside clod; And early bees are all day on the wing, And work like labour, yet like pleasure sing. IV.âAPRIL. Fair, fickle Month, now peevish as a child That frets in middle of the Pleasures' bowers; Now winsome as a bride betrimmed with flowers, LaÃ¹ghing like Wit when exquisitely wild,â How like art thou to Grief by Hope beguiled, When thou look'st smiling through short, gusty showers! How like to Joy, that laughs, yet ere an hour's Quick flight weeps in the arms where most he smiled!â Yet welcome, April! for thy blessed womb Gave greatest Shakspeare birth,âhe who, like thee, With mingling tears and smiles, strewed modestly Creation's fields with flowers of deathless bloom:â Proud be young May of her sweet floral crown; Be prouder thou, fair Month, of his supreme renown! V.âMAY. May, Summer's mother, sister of young Spring, Now votive garlands, woven of infant flowers, Festoon thy halls; and some true maiden towers Above her peers as queen where Love is king, And, in the midst of lusty youths a ring, Largesse of smiles and blushful praises showers;â And virgins pure and fair as thy white hours, (To passionate fretting of fast-fingered string, And rural reeds that pastorally play, And on the incensed air profusely pour Sounds sweet as scents,) with shepherds, on the floor Of primrose plots of green, dance fast away All winter-harms, and stir their stagnant bloods To the warm flush and hue of thy first red rose-buds. VI.âJUNE. Now come the rosy June and blue-eyed Hours, With song of bÃ­rds and stir of leaves and wings, And run of rills and bubble of bright springs, And hourly burst of pretty buds to flowers; With buzz of happy bees in violet-bowers, And gushing lay of the loud lark, who sings High in the silent sky, and sleeks his wings In frequent sheddings of the flying showers;â With plunge of struggling sheep in plashy floods, And timid bleat of shorn and shivering lamb, Answered in far-off faintness by its dam; And cuckoo's call from green depths of all woods; And hum of many sounds, making one voice That sweetens the smooth air with a melodious noise. VII.âJULY. Now the hot July hurries half-arrayed From tending his green work on sultry hill, In bower and field,âseeking the shrunken rill, Or cave, or grot, or grove of pleasant shade, But flings his length where huddled leaves have made Cool covert for faint Noon. Now not a bill Of happiest bird breaks the grave-silence still With call to his song-fellows; and not a blade O' the tall grass wags, so idle are the winds. The bee, with laden thighs, yet dares not stir For his far home; and the quick grasshopper, Though amorous of the sun, yet haply finds Deep shelter in green shades is better far Than burning in the blaze of the malign dog-star. VIII.âAUGUST. Come to the yellow fields, golden with corn!â The brawny August, with fast-reaping hand, Lays low the earth's tall plumes of pride; and blithe Young gleaners, in bee-swarms, trample the shorn Stout stubble down, with naked feet and torn, In little laps garnering allowÃ¨d tithe; And wheaten sheaves are bound with strawy band, And to the hungry barn brown Ceres' wain is borne. With no more music than the woods afford, No daintier food than is the wild strawberry, With water from clear brooks which clean deer ford, We may be fed, and pleased, and careless merry; And fear not but the day's sweet exercise Will bring night's balmiest slumber to our eyes. IX.âSEPTEMBER. Ruddy September, with wide wicker-maunds, Treads his full orchards now, and at all hours Gathers delicious sweets where are no sours. And numerous rural youth, in clamorous bands, With nut-hooks armed, clamber with knees and hands Old hazel trees, and brown nuts rain in showers, Pattering and pelting every maid that stands Within their sportive reach, who fall like flowers When hard hails pelt, and feign alarming cries, As they were hurt beyond the cure of kisses;â Their lovers drop, and read their roguish eyes, Kiss them, and feignÃ¨d pain unfeignÃ¨d bliss is, And thus the merry month wears well away, With feast and fruit, revel and roundelay. X.âOCTOBER. Few flowers, October, coronal thy head, And those are loathed by the love-kissing bee, Who kisses cold as forced satiety, Now all the honey of their mouths is shed. The woodbine's tresses, like lure-nets, are spread To tangle the wind-god;âshe feign would be As warmly wooed as she was wont, but he (Now her green youth and wanton prime are fled, And her life's winter comes with swallow-fleetness) Wings the wide air for the far bowers of Ind, And the young cassia's arms, and warmth, and sweetness. The violet, too, like an immortal mind, Lives yet not breathes; and every nook and bower Which sun and poets loved, withers,âgrass, leaf, and flower. XI.âNOVEMBER. Wrapt in dun fogs, which make the day seem night, November treads unseen. We sometimes hear His feet rustling through fallen leaves and sere; And scent his yellow breath that chokes us quite;â We know he comes, that rheumy, wheezing wight, And look for him with eyes grown dim and blear, That pry for distant things yet see not nearâ For blindness stumbles less than doubtful sight. Happy are they who in warm domiciles Trim learning's lamp and comfort's sparkling fire, Listening the while the hymning Muse's lyre, Or love's or friendship's talk, which lightly wiles The tedious and dull time with matters sweet, That make the leaden hours as restless moments fleet. XII.âDECEMBER. 'Tis dark December now. The early eves Are starless, long, and cold;âthe rain-winds moan Like pining spirits;ânight seems never gone; The day delightless dies, and morning grieves;â The robin perches most on household eaves, Craving the crumbs he sings for from the kind;â The slim deer shelter from the bitter wind Behind broad trees, couching on withered leaves. But though all things seem sad without our doors, Within sits Christmas at the board of cheer, Heaped with large tithings of the Months and Year;â Wild Wit hath now his whim;âlight Laughter roars, Till Music lifts her voice;âand Wealth's warm hearth Hath its bright eyes, old wines, brisk fires, dance, song, and mirth. XIII.âTHE NIGHTINGALE. Not farther hence than a young falcon's flight, In a low valley stands an antique grove: Dusky it is by day, but when 'tis night None may tread safely there unlit by love. In lonelier days, it was my mood to rove At all hours thereâto hear what mirth I might Of lofty-singing lark, deep-brooding dove, And powerful thrushâall breathers of delight. When Night's drawn curtains darkened the deep vale, And the rich music of the day was ended, Outgushed a song of melancholy wail, Breaking the silence it with sweetness mended:â It was the voice of the waked Nightingale,â Come thou and hear her solemn-sounding tale. XIV.âTO THE NIGHTINGALE. Now that the bee hath found his honied home, And every bird of day hath tired his wing; And the dark bat, weak-winged and flittering, Wheels his short round; and murmuring of night, Heedless the beetle soars with headlong flight,â Thou, sleepless Nightingale, dost serious sing, Till vaulted groves like high-arched abbeys ring, And moon and stars unheard to hear thee come. Where, in what woody depth, wide-watered glen, High-pinÃ¨d hill, dusk dell, or musky bowers, Didst thou let pass the whiter-wingÃ¨d hours, Far from thy fellow-birds and ear of men?â All things now rest which in the day delight, And why art thou the sole sad voice of night? XV.âTHE NIGHTINGALE. Sweet Nightingale, that poet's heart was sad Who called thee Sorrow's bird! Unto my ear (Familiar to her mournful voice, as 'twere A fretful friend's) thy saddest tone is glad As the Lark's matin when the trees are cladâ As Cuckoo's call when happy May is nearâ Or any sound that maketh Pleasure mad, And drains a passionate heart of its last tear. Let the dull-eared deem thee a melancholy Bird and sorrowful, and misconceive thy song, Heard in Night's silence the calm woods among: Heed thine own voice, and never note their folly; But sing to lovers in thy dark delight, And make them sigh with mirth too exquisite! XVI.âTO THE NIGHT-STAR. Fair Star, that beautifies the swarthy night, Art thou, indeed, no more than thou dost seem,â A halo, a bright spark, shooting thy gleam Through thickly-gathering glooms, intent to light Late wanderers on their way, whether on stream Or shore, less safe, and show them their true plight, And where dark danger lurks from wicked sprite And headlong cliff?âor art thou, as some deem, A world thyself, superior to this Earth, This self-imagined all, this moulded dust, This toy o' the heavens,âwhose vainness surely must Be serious matter for thy wiser mirth?â Whate'er thou art, I lowly worship thee, As the fair work of Him who bade thee burn eternally. XVII.âTO THE MOON. Lone traveller of the nightâcold, serious, wan, Still-footed as dark stealth, silent as Sleep 'Lighting on Beauty's bed, soft-downed and deep,â What passion sick, or far hope leads thee on Nightly this weary way that wears thee thin As the shrunk cheek of death-desiring Grief; And silver-pale as the white willow-leaf That looks with thee the glassy waters in?â The noisy day is noiseless now; the night Is lost in slumber; and the giddy world, Like drunkard in his dreams, around is whirled, But feels it not, from darkness into light; And thou with all thy mystery, mind, and glory, Passest away, like a romantic story! XVIII.âTHE MOON. Oh Moon, it is a passionate delight To pore upon thy beautiful wan face, And watch thee take thy silent way by night, Like Psyche seeking her blind Love's embrace!â What art thou, fairest visionâfairyest dream? A Northern nymph, climbing the silver-snows Of thy free mountains proudly? Or, as some deem, A Spirit of the Air, that nightly goes To see thy beauties mirrored, and to dress Thy golden tresses by the sheeny sea? Or some fair, passion-pining shepherdess, Tending thy fleecy flock on lonely lea? Or that fond vestal girl, on Sestos' shore Lighting the waves for him who'll land there never more? XIX.âSPRING. Come with me, lady, to the springing woods, Whose age, like thine, is young and beautiful; For there are flowers of rainbow-hues to pull; Violets that breathe thy breath; delicious buds Red as thy lips, sweet as thy slumber's sighs; Streamlets that run as silvery as thy speech; Pleasures that with no pain our hands may reach; And leaves, and birds, and songs, and sunny skies. The bee, who roves, yet is industrious, Calls us away to the green woods agen, As Robin's horn drew forth his merry men To sports and beechen spearsâto twanging bows And breathless chace of bounding doe and deer:â Then hie for hill and dale!âthe season laughs not here. XX.âTHE BOWER. Hard by there is a shady greenwood nookâ Haply by fairies formed, for sweet repose And pleasure of their queen. A silvery brook, Reflecting all which overhangs it, flows Smoothly by with noise of many springs. The young birds tenant it, and woo and pair, And silent sit to hear the thrush, who sings His frequent song of summer-blitheness there. 'Twill soon be reached, if we use willing speed; Then let us henceâmaking so little stir, Our light steps shall not rouse the grasshopper:â I have a song to breatheâa book to read; And we may pass the hours in such employ As will to hearts like ours give certainty of joy. XXI.âTHE BEE. Marked you a Bee that circled round our ears, And stunned them with his noisy trumpeting, Now faintly heard? Again these flowers he nears, But drops among them with more cautious wing. With low monotonous hum he first to sleep Hath lulled these maiden flowers, and now doth steal, Just as Dishonesty will watch and creep, To rob them whilst they nothing fear or feel. When he is sated, with a louder blow Of his deep horn he'll henceâbut not by stealth; Glad and rejoicing you shall hear him go, Leaving them robbed of beauty's virgin wealth:â How like to a seducer now is he, Winning by craft what some forbear through honesty! XXII.âEVENING. Pleasant it is, although the woods are brown, And trees grow thin and bare, and flowers are few, Careless of sweeping mist or dropping dew, Through lonely fields to wander far from town, When PhÅbus doffs his glorious golden crown, And bedded is the lark and late cuckoo, And nothing stirs save shadows of dark hue,â The latest leaves autumnal winds have strown,â The Bee, belated, hurrying to hive His latter gleanings, too much tired to sing,â The mouse-like bat, flapping his sooty wing,â Or beetle blind, who comes with heedless drive, Fierce in his flight, 'gainst traveller or tree, Drops in the dust, and there must trampled be. XXIII.âTHE SAME. 'Tis pleasant then to stand so silently, That from far wall loud sounds the cricket's chirr, And hearken to the faint suburban stir, And city's deeper hum; the hourly cry Of Time's wide-warning voice; or Evening's sigh, Like a sad nun's in prayer; or sounds which near Might seem discordant to some Midas' ear, But, in the distance mingling, make sweet harmony. And when the Moon usurps her brother's sphere 'Tis pleasant to behold the stars serene; The silver moonlight on the silent scene; The sleeping earth; and skies like waters clear, Through which some sights of heaven we may discern, Which glorify this world, though we for others yearn. XXIV.âCOMPARISONS. Her eyes' soft hue was of that serene grey Which softly tints the western sky at eve, When the light lingers by the dying Day, And Vesper shines under the portal-eave Of the dark East, ushering the silent way Of solemn Night; and the dusk Shadows leave Their sunless cells and forest haunts, and grieve, As at some tall tree's base their lines decay, That Day should drive them from their darksome lair; And under her pale brow, like sister stars, Those twin orbs beam'd through her dark-dropping hair Looks like the pensive Moon's, when heaven unbars Her silver gates, and gladdens the dark earth,â Solighting my dull heart to brightness, love, and mirth. XXV.âTHE SUMMER STORM. Whence is this hushâthis silence, so profound? Those gathering glooms which make earth early dark, And fright to silence the late-singing lark, Who ere his time is lodging on the ground?â Nature hath surely paused, and not a sound Or motion shows her trance!âoh vain remark, For she nor rests nor knows to tire!âAnd hark! In the far distance thunderâand lightning leaps around!â A storm is in the heavensâa fearful storm, Such as the wicked shall with dread appal; For who can tell on whom the bolt may fall, When it may 'light, and how and whom inform That Heaven impatient is, and will not wait To strike the vengeful blow it justly may foredate! XXVI.âTHE STORM. A fearful storm hangs hovering o'er the worldâ Its signs are visibleâits march is nigh!â Behold the wrack which scuds the under sky, And yon cloud-tufts, that, by the wind uncurled, Stream forward on the air, like flags unfurled; Whilst rock-like clouds seem tumbling massively, As if once more rebellion raged on high, And Titan arms those mighty missiles hurled. The awe-struck Earth is stillâsave that the owl Hoots horror in the ear; the raven cries; The cattle moan; the swallow whirling flies Close to the wave; the bat forbears to prowl; The dark bird warbles now like lover's lute, And now, abrupt, her wild, melodious rage is mute. XXVII.âTHE STORM. God is about us in this dangerous place, Therefore at what thou hear'st quail not, nor start; But hearken, with a hushed, untroubled heart, To His high voice whose music fills the space 'Tween us, and heaven, and Him. Face unto face, As the first Prophet did, if pure thou art, Thou may'st behold his look; and He will part Thee and all fearful Ills, should they embrace Thee closer than they do; and with his power Beat down thy foes as foes to Him and good,â Lending thee such protection as a flower Gains from the mighty Oak, when tempests brood How most they may destroy, with blast and shower, Summer's frail charms.âThen dread not this rude solitude. XXVIII.âTHE WINDS. Hark to the winds, that wildly rave and roar, Like ministers of wrath, loosed to destroy Man's and the season's hope,âwith savage joy Tearing young Autumn's bowers, ere his full store Is garnered in, and flinging on his floor Green fruit, and leaf unsered, and seedless flower, And yellow corn,âwrecking in one brief hour The work of many months, and woe of more!â The rich man in his hall shuts close his door, And heeds it not; it takes from him no meal, Nor makes his cheek to pale, his heart to feel:â His house is stored; his board, that feasts no poor, Battens the fat, and fat hearts never weep;â Then let the poor man pine, the proud man sleep!â XXIX.âTHE WINDS. That God, who doth the lowly sparrow keep, And with his hidden hand sustaineth all, May make his Babel-built, high-piled hall Toss like a mastless ship upon the deep Wide-weltering sea, at once the mark and mock Of the strong thunder, striking his flint wall As through his heart, and crumbling his tall rock Of surety as 'twere sand; whilst lightnings fall Like fiery waves on his wrecked towers, and steep Them in blue sulphurs; till, like a pyre Piled for some living death, in the fierce fire Of his proud phÅnix-nest, a nameless heap His ashes rot:âmeanwhile, in his safe shed, Poor Worth may weep but live, for angels guard his bed. XXX.âTHE LIGHTNING. The lightning now, leaping the vault of night, Stirred its black air to light,âas when from heaven The rebel Spirit, hurled to that nether stream, Splashed its dark sulphurs up with silvery gleam;â And the thick-veiling darkness now was riven Open and wide, as the vast heavens were rent, Making sight blind with a quick, blasting light. Nearer and nearer the round thunder wheeled, Shaking the earth, that like a bubble reeled Dizzy and drunken through the lapsing air.â The storm is roused; and now the full clouds weep, Like stubborn sinners, the dread wrath they dare! Guilt trembles cold in his disturbÃ¨d sleep,â But fear not thou, whose soul is white and innocent! XXXI.âTHE STORM. The storm came on. The strong and awful thunder Shook the wild air; the sudden lightning rent The cowl of Night; and light and darkness blent Blastingly together. The winds rushed under The low-branched woods, and violently tore His russet robes from Autumn's back, and threw Them at his feet; and then the loud uproar Fainted to silence audibleâand a few Rain-drops came down like tears!âMy love wept too; But 'twas in pity part, and part in fear For those at whom Wrath's bolt was hurledâthe tear She shed for sinners doomedâthat pure heart-dew, Was dear to heaven as those of agony Bathing His brow who wept in dark Gethsemane! XXXII.âTHE SAME. Deep in the hollow bosom of a dell, Under a towering tree, whose sinewy root Grappled the ground like a huge monster's foot, We crouched, and let the loose Winds rush to fell The old wood's pride, with horrid howl and yell, Such as make Asian forests quake, when brute Bellows to brute; or like that taunting hoot Which mocked at heaven when angels plunged to hell. That tree was our stout mast; the circling hills Seemed, to our dizzy eyes, like those green waves That shroud the mariners' ever-open graves. Happy were those who kept in domiciles, And only heard the storm; for 'twas a night Fearful to such as had less courage than affright! XXXIII.âTHE SAME. Her blood's red tides returned upon her heart As timid lambs together rush in fear, Or rills recoil to their far fountain-mere, When the earth quakes. To see the clouds dispart, And scorch with flame, as man's last doom was near, Flash following flash, making the strong heart start; To hear the threatening thunder-car career Round the shook heavens, and mark the lightning dart Down on its fateful mission; and the trees, High-roofed and centre-rooted, topple as did Those pillars huge, each one as pyramid Broad-based and vast, when the strong Hebrew fell Buried by broken towers and monuments, well Might scare a soul that knew not Nature's agonies. XXXIV.âTHE CALM. Like as an Eastern empress, from her tent Spread on some lofty hill, looks far abroad On her wide realm, so from her bright abode, Under the starry, deep-blue firmament, The Moon walked forth, and all the storm was still. The trees stood firm as pyramidal stone; The woods yet rained, though the rain-clouds were gone; From the steep hills poured silvery rill in rill; Freshness, soft airs, the silent sighs of flowers That dared not breathe while the winds raged, breathed now Like balm about the glittering-leavÃ¨d bowers; And the proud nightingale, from bough to bough Fluttering her wetted wings, 'gan warbling strong Her various sweetness and fine-laboured song. XXXV.âRESIGNATION. God of the sunny calm and cloudy storm, The beams that gladden and the bolts that kill, Shall Man, presumptuous, dare arraign Thy will, Should it Thy pleasure be quite to deform The beauty and the glory of the Earth,â Erase its forests oldâuproot its woodsâ Level its hills to plainsâexalt its floods To kiss the under cloudsâcommand a dearth Where plenty isâwhere happy Nature smiled, Pleased with herself and all which she surveyed, Bare, more than Winter can, her bowers of shade, And spread the desolate and dreary wild?â Noâ'twas Thy word which bade this World to be; It rolls while Thou uphold'st, and falls when left by Thee! XXXVI.âINVITING TO THE FIELDS. Ye who are worn with yon close city's stir, Come to the fields, full of the breath of June, Now while the thrush and lark, with frequent tune, Sweeten the silent air; and with shrill chirr And click continual the grasshopper Frolics around the feet of slumberous Noon;â Now while wood-doves in pathless depths commune, And all whom Nature loves sing now of her. Lone treading through the dew of dells and hills, I turn, and pry for that dim spot and far Hid in thick-breathing smoke, like stationed star Dark-masked in clouds; and stirring memory rills Through my tired heart a coldly-gushing tear For all the hopes and years which lived and withered there. XXXVII.âTHE FIELDS. Thanks be to Nature, some green spots remain Free from the tread and stain of that gross world Whose god is commerce, and religion gainâ Its altars furnaces, whose smoke is curled Around the very clouds!âBe praise agen To Nature and her God! while some are whirled The dizzy round of joy, and some turn churled Or fevered from life's game,âto balm the pain Of a stung heartâstill the self-troubled brainâ Refine the mindâsilence, if not appease, Pale recollections, memory's agonies, And throw the load of anxious cares behind, There still are flowery meadows, pathless woods, Groves, hills, and vales, forests and solitudes! XXXVIII.âOTHER WORLDS. I know not, ye bright stars, which nightly burn Yet never waste, whether ye are but lights Hung in this earth's high hall, to give the nights Some beauty of the day, lest man should yearn Too soon for that last heaven, which he must earn With patience here, making his woes delights; Yet my tired soul, worn with the world's sharp spites, And sad of its sick hopes, hungers to learn Whether ye are not worlds of finer spirits, Lit with more present suns and whiter hours, Sweet with the balm of never-withering flowers, And sounds and songs;âwhere he who once inherits, Sure in the safety of a stormless haven, Lives blest, and pines for no imagined heaven. XXXIX.âNATURE. Nature hath sights and sounds should never tire!â Such is the hum of honey-sated bee; The various voice of birds, who hireless choir Their mellow songs to the young seasons three; The stir of waters vast,âwhether they be Of ocean, lake, or river; the fields' attire; The rustling corn ripening on hill and lea; The sun enthroned upon his car of fire; The golden sunlight on the silver sea; The day that dies like widow on the pyre Where burns her bright-haired lord; the sweet respire Of incense-wafting flowers; the moon, when she Walks pale and lonely as sad Niobe; With all God formed for man, but man will not admire. XL.âTO THE MOON. Queen-Beauty of the Nightâpale and aloneâ Eye not so coldly Love's brief happiness; But look as once when thou forsook'st thy throne, Woman in all but thy free hunter's dress, And with white buskined limbs, through dew and flowers, Lightly, on sprightly feet and agile, bounded With fawn-like leaps among the Latmian bowers, While the wide dome of highest heaven resounded With shrilling shouts of thee and thy nymph-rovers When the hard chace with victory was won, And changed ActÃ¦on by his own hounds was torn!â But then thou hadst not seen Endymion, Nor knew the pain and coldness of his scorn;â Yet, if thy love was dear to thee, be dear to lovers! XLI.âWRITTEN IN A THEATRE. Oh for the quiet of the woods and hills, Broke but by storms (which make it more intense When they have passed in dread magnificence), Or by the gusty wind that sadly shrills Thorough their woodsâor by the rippling rills Running to some deep river, not far thence Making a murmur as its channel fills!â Oh for the vales where violets dispense Honey to bees, storing their frequent scrips; Where the loud lark to listening cherubim (Though we of earth may hear) sings high his hymn, And the full thrush among the ripening heps Prisons dumb wonder in some sylvan spot,â Rather than smiling haunts, where inward joy is not! XLII.âLOVE OF THE FIELDS. I leave the marts where this world's treasure's won, For places where its hues alone are seen, In yellow flowers that burnish in the sun, And white that silver-tip the May-banks green. Yet on his scrambled heaps the miser's eyne, Loving his being's bane, did never gloat With half of my delight when as I note The moonlight silvering the waters sheen!â And herein am I richer far and wiser Than he who barters life for worthless wealth, And as his riches swell turns poor and miser, Losing the life of life,âdelight and health, Calm, innocent nights, and charitable days, Not spent to selfish ends, but the good Giver's praise! XLIII.âDEATH OF SUMMER. Summer is dead and earthed, and o'er her grave Dark clouds pass slow and shadowy, shedding tears That beauty should be born for death, and have So short a term of days which should be years. No voice is heard but murmurs of despair:â The wild winds through her flowerless bowers rave; Her sister, Autumn, rends her yellow hair, And weeps the more that tears were vain to save âAnd weep the more because I weep in vain.â; The sorrowful Robin sings her requiem, And strews her hearse with all his favourite leaves; The sprightly Lark somewhere in silence grieves, And will not chaunt his wonted matin-hymn; And Nature, her proud mother, mourns her child With that unuttered grief which is not soon beguiled. XLIV.âAUTUMN. When Autumn leaves strew hill, and dale, and brook, And yet the trees are clad, 'tis sweet to lie In sun or shade, where winds run fluttering by, Shutting the leaves of some beloved book, (That flaps like startled bird,) ere you can look Through its well-wedded lines. Then wean your eye From studious stare, to pore upon the sky Dappled with fleecy clouds, (as if the crook Of Dian's shepherd had been gathering His golden lambs from PhÅbus' chariot-way,) And, letting fancy have her airy wing, Thus in lone musing wear the serious day, As slumber motionless where all is motion, And woods with winds are tossed like green waves of the ocean. XLV.âTHE AUTUMNAL FIRESIDE. Let the winds rush!âthey fan our Autumn fire, And make it red and loud. And let them tear Our bower's brown locks,âthey cannot ravage here; And let them in their fitful breathings moan,â They cannot thrill us though like fiends they groan, Or howl like famished Wolves; nor drown thy song Full-throated, lark-like, silvery sweet, and strong From strength of thy glad heart. Come, sit thee nigher, And glow with the fire's glow: for none without Crave share of our light meal, and genial hearth, Where the warmth-loving cricket creeps about, And shrills his song of sociable mirth. Then let the winds rage on!âAnon, our sleep Shall be more dead than shipboy's rocked by the rude deep. XLVI.âON A FRIEND'S DEPARTURE. His tarrying with us was a happy dream, Wherein sweet-voiced Music, sweeter Poesy, Were heard, as down Time's restless-running stream We floated buoyantlyâtriumphantly! A sun he was among us, and a light Splendid with knowledge, with a steady ray Shining full on our hearts; and to our sight Pleasant and smiling as the face of May. Such was his staying with usâbut his leaving Was like that voiceless heart-regret we feel When standing lonely at the time of Even, Looking where Day away from us did stealâ Remembering whilst he lingered here his brightness, And thoughts of cheerfulness, and looks of lightness. XLVII.âMEMORY. Three simple sounds which strike upon my ear,â My lattice rattling in the gusty wind; The sabbath-bell, with admonition kind, That tells the hour is come for praise and prayer; My mother's footstep on the creaking stair,â These sounds, by some mysterious link of mind, Bring back the years which life has left behind; And feelings,âkeen as iron-armed Despair Had never blunted them, nor gnawing Care Had fed upon the substance of my heart,â And hopes, like flowers where all was barren, start, And paint my future path in colours fair. Such power hath Memory!âoh had she, too, the power To make her golden chain last longer than the hour! XLVIII.âNATURAL APPEARANCES OF NOVEMBER. Farther and farther rolls the sun's pale fire, And the last flowers die on Summer's corse; The winter winds grow stronger voice and force, As the woods feel that fall beneath their ire, Strewing the earth with their own funeral pyre; The chafÃ¨d rivers rave till they are hoarse, Whilst Boreas, rushing forward his fierce course, Sweeps the white wave as 'twere Arion's lyre. Dark, sullen month, of cheerless days like nights, The homeless wanderers, the pined and poor, Who nightly lie at Comfort's closÃ¨d door, Feel thy torpedo touch,âwhich coldly bites Them to the heart, and stifles their hard breath, Till they sleep, senseless that their sleep is death! XLIX.âLONDON IN NOVEMBER. Oh mighty City! proud rival to proud Rome When Rome least feared that Rome could ever fall,â November's clouds hang o'er thee like a pall, Muffling the mind with dark, funereal gloom!â To me thou art no better than a tomb, That buries life like death. I stifling call On Help, who hears me not; and see my doom, Yet cannot pass my loathsome dungeon's wall:â Stern Hardship holds me with short-reaching chains, Which bind me like a maniac to the earth,â So that I may not hence to hear the mirth And voice of winds and waves, and bird and bee; Nor once behold high mountains, spreading plains, And watch the workings of earth, sky, and sea. L.âDISCONTENT. Oh, had I been a lowly shepherd boy, Feeding my flocks upon the cloudy mountains, Descending but to lead them where fresh fountains Water the valleys with white rills,âmy joy, And sole ambition, and serene employ, Had been to note their strength with frequent telling, And live lone lord of my high airy dwelling, Tasting those healthy joys which never cloy:â But 'twas my bane in city to be born, Where Wealth may show, but Worth must hide his head; Where Vice may waste, and Virtue want life-bread; Where golden minds are poor and live forlorn, And walk in crowds, and then are most alone, Living neglected, dying unwept, unknown. LI.âINVOCATION. Immortal spirit of her who in me bred A deathless loveâif thou dost mortally live Out of thine own heaven, some knowledge give Of where thou art, that I may now be fed With sight of thee; and be thine eyes' light shed On night's o'er-shadowed skyâand leave it there, Like a blest star, to lead me through the air, As those wise Easterns old to Bethlehem were led!â Do this, if thou dost live; but if thy breath Is breathed, guide my weak steps to thy young grave, That I may mourn on it, and madly rave, Till loathÃ¨d life expires in wished-for death! Hear meâand some way answer meâoh hover, Living or dead, about thy dying lover! LII.âA WISH. When I am dead, and in that narrow house Where all must dwell, and none who lodge there leave, I would not have the few who love me grieve Above my earth; nor flatter death with shows Which mock at life; nor scatter the sweet rose O'er foul decay; nor wish a friend to weave A funeral wreath:âbut if some dark yew boughs Bend there, and weep their dews at dusk of eve, And on a prostrate and time-trampled stone My name be writ (which Fame hath never known) With shadow of a finger in the sun, That it may fade like that forgotten one Who bore it to no end,âI shall be blest, And take what here was most denied meârest.</field>
