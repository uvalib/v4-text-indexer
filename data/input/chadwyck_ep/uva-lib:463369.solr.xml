Remembre man, thou art earth playne And therto shalt, returne agayne. Iob. Of late as I lay, musynge all alone Reuoluynge a certayne thynge in my mynde Whiche troubled me so, that my herte was gone But beynge compelled, remedy to fynde Myne olde custome, not beynge yet resynde I rose from my bedde, and forth dyd departe And then herde I a byrde synge, O man vnkynde I say remembre thou man, what thou arte. Whiche thynge so heryng, made me moche to muse And as I loked, what byrde it shuld be She spyde me and sayd, nowe fayne thyne excuse For truely I haue, a quarell to the And with that, I sawe hyr syt in a tre Whiche made me I tell you, glad at my harte But she spyenge that sayd, streyghe vnto me Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. I perceyue by thy countenaunce, quod she That thou dost moche reioyse, in my presence But lytell cause hast thou, thou mayst truste me For nowe art thou, with me out of credence Because thou hast not done, thy dylygence To performe thy promyse, made on thy parte Therfore in reproche, of thy neclygence Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Why what matter quod I, hast thou to me That thou shludest me, thus spytefully reproue Matter ynoughe, I warant the quod she For that thou dyddest not, as dyd the behoue What is it quod I, tell me for my loue Haue I in my promyse, ben ouerthawrte Ye none excuse quod she, can it remoue Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte. Thou dydest promyse me, yf thou call to mynde To set forth a songe, whiche I sange to the And nowe because vntrewe, I do the fynde Thou dost me prouoke, displeased to be That songe forth quod I, thou mayst truste me I se no profe quod she, for who doth reuarte From theyr vyce reprouyd, not one I can se Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte. It is forth quod I, though small profyte apere Consernynge of mannes lyfe, the amendment Thou mayst reproue synne, and neuer the nere All this worlde is set on myschefe. 1. Ioh?. 5. We are vnto the flesshe, so fully bente Then my laboure quod she, in vayne haue I spent But no doute at length, for it ye shall smarte Oneles that by grace, your faute ye repente Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Thou art but vyle earth, and shall turne to dust Though all the worldes good, thou haddest at thy wyll Iob. At the laste c?mes death, and then hense thou muste There is no treasure, can kepe the here styll Therfore thou vayne man, why dost thou fulfyll Thy flesshely luste, and from god dost reuarte Wylt thou for thy flesshe, thy soule deadely kyll Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. God hath apoynted, of his meare goodnesse Howe eche man shuld lyue, in his vocacyon Let euery man abide in his callyng wherin he is called. 1. Cor. 7. And scrypture doth, vnto you all expresse So that ye can make, no excusacyon But that ye prouoke, your owne dampnacyon Oneles ye repent, or death with his darte Of body and soule, make seperacyon Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Somwhat I haue, toched to the before Howe moste people here, doth lyue out of frame In the myrour of she mysery of the worlde. Not one shalt thou fynde, scaffy in a score That lyueth in his offyce, vnworthy blame Nay clene to necclecte, yet they haue no shame Or els they abuse it, so ouerthwarte That they seme not, to haue a chrysten name Remembre therfore thou man what thou arte. What nedes thou quod I, this thynge to reherse It is superfluous, as farre as I here In thy songe before, in many a verse Thou hast touched this, as well doth apere What though sayd she, I am neuer the nere I se no man grafte, my wordes in his harte Therfore I warne the agayne, playne and clere Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. I shewed the ones, and so I do agayne Howe euery creature, without blame Make we m? to our owne lykenes and symylytude. Gen. 1.Doth kepe theyr course, as nature doth constrayne But thou man whiche God, so nobly dyd frame Unto his ymage, thou wylt graunt the same And yet lyke a beaste, from God ouerthwarte Thou defylest his ymage, to thy great shame Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte. I knowe quod I, that thou toldest me all this Trouste thou that I haue, so dull memory To forget what goddes goodnesse, to me is Ye sayd she, I beleue it verely For thou art so replete, with mysery No thynge can moue the, from synne to reuerte But yet whan thou fedest, thy lust besely Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. What thou meanest sayd I, I can not tell I pray the shewe me, what thou dost intende Thou checkest me, me thynke for not lyuynge well And yet with no faute, dost me reprehende Haue I not sayd she, howe dost thou attende Unto my wordes, whiche enter not thy harte But in all thy tyme, that thou dost here spende Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Dyd not I say, howe in synne thou dost lyue By whiche thy soule, thou dost moste foully defyle Whiche God of his goodnes, to the dyd gyue Made to his ymage, and lyke no beaste vyle And yet the deuyll, from the for to excyle He suffred death here, with paynfull woundes smarte Amende therfore, and euery meane whyle Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Thy soule thou knowest, well is made immortall Hauynge wyll reason, and vnderstandynge In whiche thou dost deffer, from beastes brutall And therin to God, thou arte resemblynge But nowe in what case, thy soule thou dost brynge I purpose to shewe the, or thou departe That for feare, thou wylt quake at the herynge Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Fyrste thou hast reason, a gyfte excelent Whiche to the father, is apropryate Because that he is, alway permenent And dyd his persone, neuer derogate Note ones altrynge, but in deuyne estate He alway abydeth, and can not reuarte For whiche by reason, he is fygurate Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Nowe syth that by reason, thou dost represent In thy soule, to the Father eternall Whiche syngnyfyeth, thou muste be dylygent To obaye to reason, the powre pryncyall But howe thou from reason, dayly doest fall Thou mayst be asshamed man of thy parte As somwhat herafter. tell the I shall Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. So longe as to reason, thou dost agree In all thy workes, and conuersacyon So longe aperyth, in thy soule to be Thymage of God, by his creacyon Let reason than, haue domynacyon Folowe not wyll, and set reason aparte Put not the Father, from his mancyon Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. I trowe quod I, thou knowest not what thou sayest Thou hast forgot clene, what thou dyddest begyn Me thynke thou doest spende, many wordes in waste Wylt thou not, the other two powers brynge in Yes quod she, but bycause thy wyt is thyne I wolde that to reason, thou shuldest conuarte Whiche thou dayly, doest so fowle blot with synne Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. But for thy sake quod she, I am content The other two powers, to the to expresse Whyll in thy soule, doth the sone represent Math. 29.For as moche as he dyd, hym alway dresse To do his fathers wyll, with great mekenesse Wyllyngly suffrynge, for thy synfull harte Thus christe of good wyll, thy synnes dyd redresse Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte. Nowe lyke as Christ, onely of his good wyll He offrede vp hym because he wolde. Esa. 53.Toke here thy nature, and redemed the From the deuyll and synne, whiche dyd thy soule kyll He wyll not his death, thy sauegarde shall be He that louithme kepith my c?maunde mentes. Ioh?. 15.Onelesse thy wyll, freely to his agre Not compelled, but by loue from thy harte This meane by Iustyce, apoynted hath he Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Nowe stay there quod I, I pray the be styll Let me in this poynt, vnderstande the well Wylt thou affyrme here, that man hath fre wyll Thou sayst that God, doth not mannes wyll compell Mary syr yf I, that abrode shuld tell Some wolde say that I, the trueth dyd peruarte Wyll they quod she, agaynst that thynge rebell Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. A thou wycked man, nowe well I perceyue Thou woldest fynde, away thy vyce to excuse For yf thou couldest proue, the no free wyll to haue God temp tyth no m? to euyll. Iaco. 1. Thou woldest for thy synne, gods goodnes accuse Bycause thou wylt say, he wolde not infuse Grace in to thy soule, from synne to conuarte Alas man do not, thy lyfe so abuse Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. God offryth his grace, to the man dayly Beholde I stond at the dore &amp; knocke. Apoc 3. Knockynge at thy soule, by many away Declarynge his wyll, moste mercyfully To haue the saued, yf thou say not nay Therfore yf thou wylt, be saued thou may God wold haue all men saued. 1. Timo. 2. Gods helpe is redy, yf thou do thy parte Thou mayst consent, yf thou wylt I dare say Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. If thou wylt enter in to lyfe kepe the c?maundementes. Math. 9. In this quod I, thou hast peased my mynde But may hap all other, so wyll not be For in this matter, great faute they wyll fynde When so euer they shall, it rede or se What tho and they do, I pray the quod she Trueth wyll be trueth, though they wolde it peruarte Therfore to all them, as well as to the I say remembre, thou man what thou arte. I passe not sayd she, what any doth say So longe as the trueth, I do demonstrate To please all myndes, I do not knowe the way Onelesse I shuld, gods pleasure vyolate And that wyll I not do, for none estate Nothynge shall cause me, from trueth for to starte But let all this passe, early and late Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. If thou hast sayd I, in this sayd thy mynde I pray the, in thy fyrste purpose prosede Content sayd she, I haue it not resynde Though I dyd degresse, as I thought it nede Understandynge, is nowe the next in dede Or memory whiche twayne, can not departe In this the holy ghost, thy soule doth lede Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte, By vnderstandynge, well may syngnyfy In thy soule the Ymage, of the holy ghost Bycause it is a powre, whiche inwardly The knowledge of holy thynges is vnderst?dynge. ?gs. P 30. 9.?Doth worke, in thy soule a thynge whiche doth most Profyte thy soule helth, this well I dare bost For therby gods wyll, thou knowest in thy harte Without whiche, thou shuldest, be blynde as a post Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. Nowe I trowe sayd she, thou doth playne perceyue Howe to gods ymage, that thou art create And in what it restyth, openyd I haue Nowe syth that God, in the is socyate Let not his grace, in the be vacuate Kepe this ymage pure, in euery parte So shalt thou with hym, be peticipate Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. What nede I quod she, the here to exorte That thou shuldest, this ymage nothyng defyle For nowe I se playne, thy workes do reporte Thou hast done it redy, by thy synnes vyle For whiche cause I se, I muste turne my style To shewe howe thou dost, these thre powres peruarte By whiche I feare me, thou dost god excyle Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Fyrste for as moche, as I tolde the before That reason is the powre, moste pryncypall By whiche onely, thou dyfferest euermore From all other beestes, the whiche be brutall For set reason asyde, and proue I shall That beestes may compare, with the in some parte Consernynge the powres, whiche be naturall Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. The lyon in strength, doth man greatly passe And so doth the Egle, in clerenesse of syght In herynge also, compare may the asse The grayhounde to ronne, moste nemble and lyght In smellynge the hounde, by day or by nyght And in memory beestes, in plough and carte Nowe yf they had reason, passe the they myght Therfore remembre, thou man what thou arte.

Now haue I tolde the, how thou oughtest alwaye Thy body and soule, to god to sacrafyce Which thou canst not do, onlesse thou obaye Unto reason, and thyne owne wyll dispyse But how thou doste that, thy lyuyng well tryse Folow not thy lustes but turne from thine owne wyl. Eccl. 10. Wyll doth rule the, lyke a horse in a carte What shame is this to the, that shuld be wyse Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte.

Good Abell thought, the best was not to gode To gyue to god, the gyuer of all thynge But cursed Cayne, whiche no grace vnderstode Thought the worste, to good to burne in offrynge For whiche his sacrafyce, brent all smoldrynge Whiche declared, that he from god dyd reuarte But this matter, nowe in thy mynde nothynge Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. It is not mete quod I, in our tyme I am sure To burne our goodes, to god for sacrafyce That is trueth quod she, but they in fygure Burnt theyr offerynges, in many sondry wyse Whiche fygure in trueth, ye muste excersyse As thus Abelles fyre, burnynge bryght in eche parte Sygnyfyeth charyte, whiche all good workes tryse Remembre therfore, thou man what thou arte. The bryght fyre, causeth the smoke to assende And so doth charite, cause thy good workes all Before god to haue rewarde at the ende As sayth, the holy apostell saynt paull 1. Cor. [illeg.].

Now of those that offer with good Abell A lytel before I haue shewed to the And now of another sorte I wyll tell Whiche doth offer with Cayne in eche degre And of these no small nombre ther be I can scantly thynke on them all by harte Therfore though I happe some to ouer se Remembre I saye, thou man what thou arte.

Thou oughtest, vnderstandynge hole to aplye Unto gods honoure, with a faythe perfyte But thou from god, turnest it cleane a wrye By takynge scripture, to thyne apetyte I pray the, what vertue can I resyte But that thou fyndest, scripture it to peruarte By false vnderstandynge, from gods truth quyte Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Of this sorte, thou hast full many a one Yf thou make a vowe vnto god be not slacke to performe it. Eccl. 5. Deut. 23. [illeg.]. 6. As preestes chefely, which there vowes do not kepe And yf kytte wyll come, they wyll not lye alone Tushe say they, we are nother stones nor shepe This makes them to wake, when other doth slepe Such vnderstande, gods worde ouerthwarte They feare not, ne thynke the paynes of hell depe Remembre I saye, thou man what thou arte. Some sayth quod I, that they ought to haue wyues For they say in dede, they can not lyue chaste They muste nedes go quod she, whom the dyuell dryues For of vertuous lyuynge, they haue no taste As to faste and praye, nay tye of that haste They wyll fede, and playe a reuelers parte For to saye theyr seruyce, they counte it tyme waste Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. They vse not the meanes, to lyue a chast lyfe For where as they, shuld be solytary Contrarye, to all pleasures they are ryfe And commonly, couet lyght company Then reason they, there is no remedy We must nedes mary, our fleshe to subuarte Thus for theyr vowes, they care not a butterfly Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Thus of vnderstandynge, the grace they distroye And lyke beastes they lyue, without godly respecte Uery Epicures, sekynge belly ioye With which, all the realme they haue infecte Fastynge is now, so clearely reiecte That no good preacher, can make them conuarte Well, I say no more, but this in effecte Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. I pray the quod I, of them speake no more Nor yet of none other, it is tyme to ende I se well, vertue decayeth very sore I haue herde as moche, as I do intende Arte thou wery quod she, god the amende Lo here thou mayste se thy myscheuous harte Thou thynkest tyme longe, thy lyfe to reprehende Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. I haue done quod she, but now thou mayest se That I haue kepte promyse, as I dyd saye Haue I not proued the, so wycked to be That thou gods ymage, in thy soule doest decaye So moch as lyeth in the, thou canst not saye naye I haue not flattered the truly, in no parte But now thou arte warned, conuart whyle thou maye Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. Defarre not amendment, leste tyme do fayle the Uncertayne thou arte, whan deth shall the kyll Therfore to be sure, take warnynge of me Faste, watche, and praye, and do not thy soule spyll Turne thou to god, and turne to the he wyll I can say no more, for now I wyll departe But yet at my goynge, kepe this in mynde styll Remembre I say, thou man what thou arte. When she had thus spoken, awaye she flewe Mountyng wonders hye, into the wynde So that where she became, I neuer knewe Then dyd I reuolue, her wordes in my mynde And when that I, the next leasure dyd fynde I wrote out her sentence, hole with my penne Wherin I perceaue, how people are blynde Whom god graunte to mende, saye we all amen. FINIS. The Lenuoy of the Auctor. Go forthe my booke, speake thy mynde And flatter none, of no degre All men, be men of Adams kynde Without any diuersite For all mens soules created be To gods ymage, as thou dost tell Which they foule blotte, as they may se Yf that they do, peruse the well. And I praye the, tell all men this Yf chaunce I fayle, in any thynge That I erre not, of no malys In erroure, any man to brynge But am redy to reformynge In any thynge, that thou dost saye But truely, to my knowlegynge Thou tellest the truth, nere as thou maye And where, as lacketh eloquence To make the pleasaunt, for to rede Axe pardon, for my necligence For I confesse, in very dede That of lernynge, surely I nede To make the, a more pleasaunte style But a rude wytte, rudely doth lede So rudely nedes, I must compyle And all doutes, cleane to put awaye Who was thyne auctor, the to frame Saye Myles Hogarde, so swere thou maye Though some doth thynke, he settes his name To that, which other men myght clame But of that, no man profe can brynge And yf they can, let them hym shame As well they maye, prouyng that thynge. But now an ende, of the to make Trustynge thou shalt, be taken well God graunt vs all, vyce to forsake And to thynke on both, heuen and hell With feare and loue, not to rebell Agaynst gods lawe, in any case And then no doute, but we shall dwell With hym, in his moost ioyfull place. FINIS. God saue the Kynge.</field>
