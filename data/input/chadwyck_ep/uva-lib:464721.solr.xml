      <field name="fulltext">[PART the First.] ADVICE TO THE POETS. A POEM Occasioned by the Wonderful Success of Her Majesty's Arms, under the Conduct of the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders. Printed in the Year 1706. Oh, let the Conqueror stop his swift Career, A while the Foe, a while the Poet spare: What Muse can follow with an equal Pace Thro' the bright Stages of his rapid Race? He, like the Orbs of Light that roll above, Does in his glorious Course so swiftly move, His Conquests are so suddain, so compleat, And the fierce Foe his Arms so oft defeat, The Muse exhausted pants and hangs the Wing, Nor has more Strength to rise, nor Breath to sing. He Danger seeks, he asks unequal Fight, And conquers faster than our Bards can write; So thick Illustrious Vict'ries on them throng, That half his Triumphs must be left unsung. To sink the Proud, and suff'ring Nations save, To curb the Tyrant and release the Slave, Two Winters past, at Anna's high Command, The Chief prepar'd to leave Britannia's Land. He shone in Arms, and to the Great Campaign, Flew, like a threatning Tempest, cross the Main; He lands, and at their great Asserter's Sight, Fair Liberty rejoyc'd and publick Right. The Hero march'd, and on the Danube's Tide He chang'd the Ballance to Germania's Side, And terrible chastis'd the Gaul's aspiring Pride. By Marlbro's Sword upheld, the wondring Flood Was, like Egyptian Rivers, turn'd to Blood; Danubius swoln with Spoils of Foreign Lands, Dead Steeds and Warriors rolling o'er his Sands, Flow'd on, Britannia's Triumphs to convey To Eastern Empires and the Euxine Sea. The Hellespont and high Byzantia's Tow'rs Shook with the Thunder of the British Pow'rs: The num'rous Nations of the spacious East Struck with Amazement stood, while from the West They saw so bright a Luminary rise, And with his rival Beams adorn their Skies. The Muse forsaking fair Britannia's Thames Attends the Chief to Danaw's distant Streams. She pass'd the German Sea and Belgia's Soil, To sing Immortal Deeds and Blenheim's Glorious Toil: Now high Augusta, now Britannia rung, With Lyrick Numbers and Heroick Song, While Albion's Youth, in tuneful Lays unvers'd Nor yet refin'd, with grateful Zeal rehears'd Great Marlbro's Wars, and by an early Bloom Promis'd ripe Numbers and great Men to come; Adulter Poets all their Riches drain'd, Rais'd high their Voices and their Sinews strain'd, And lavish of their Force, at vast Expence Of generous Fire and Master Eloquence, In Strains sublime attempted to display The Martial Toil of Hochsted's wondrous Day; Which, as unhappy, Albion's Isle regards To Gallick Warriors and to British Bards; Those, by contending Marlbro' to repel, And These, by singing his Atchievements, fell; For Blenheim was a Theme too bright, too strong, For Maro's Rapture, or the Grecian Song; In this Effort we did our Stock exhaust, Spent all our Genius, and our Vigour lost. Say, ye uncautious Sons of Eloquence, Wastful of Wit; and prodigal of Sense, Could you believe the British Hero's Sword Would no more Triumphs, no more Themes afford? That here the Chief's Victorious Course would cease, That you and Gallia might indulge your Ease? That Judgment had been right, had Marlbro' fought For meer Renown, and only Laurels sought; For, one brave Toil, like that of Blenheim's Field, To which the Twelve Herculean Labours yield, Consummate Vertue to the World displays; We own the Hero, and we sing his Praise. Had therefore low Designs, had Wealth and Fame, Or mean Ambition kindled Marlbro's Flame, Like vulgar Warriors, had the Chief with Care And Caution play'd the doubtful Game of War, After the wondrous Deeds at Blenheim done, Where all, that Thirst of Glory seeks, was won, The Hero had resign'd his high Command, And rose from Combate with a winning Hand: He had retir'd with envy'd Laurels crown'd, And a delightful Seat on Isis found; There liv'd from publick Labour free, and far From Fields of Slaughter, and rude Shocks of War But 'tis his Country's, 'tis Europa's Cause, That to the Camp the mighty Briton draws: Divine Compassion to oppress'd Mankind, Like that which dwells in Anna's generous Mind, To lead her Armies forth the Hero's Heart inclin'd. Fair Liberty, and Right, and antient Laws, And Anna's, which is Humane Nature's Cause, Invite the Chief his Labours to repeat, And thy Redemption, Europe, to compleat. He yieldsâhe undertakes the pious Toil, And with the Trophies, with Illustrious Spoil, And Laurels sprung from Danaw's Banks adorn'd, His rapid Course of Glory back he turn'd. Bless'd by the num'rous States to Peace restor'd, And Princes rescu'd by his conqu'ring Sword, The great Deliv'rer marches to the Rhine, To break his Chains, and drive encroaching Sein. 'Tis doneâthe Sein's ambitious Waves subside, Reluctant roar, and backward roll their Tide. Oh! had not Envy, had not Discord reign'd, And the swift Progress of his Arms restain'd, The next Campaign had equal Wonders shown, And Triumphs giv'n, like those at Blenheim won; But that which follow'd, on the Chief confers Vict'ries postpon'd, and Glory's full Arrears. The Solar Orb did from the South retreat, And thro' the Air diffuse reviving Heat, Solace the Soil, exhilerate the Swain, And Nature loose from Winter's Chrystal Chain, When the Great Chief, at Anna's high Command, Return'd to chear Batavia's joyful Land: Dreadful in Arms he march'd to Brabant's Coast, And Terror struck thro' Gallia's shuddring Host, Whose Cohorts o'er the Ground, like Locusts, spread, Each Herb devour'd, and crop'd each verdant Head. The Vet'ran Troops inur'd to Blood advance, The Scourge of Europe, and the Pride of France, The Squadrons reach'd thy frighted Fords, Mehaigne, And cover'd all Ramillia's spacious Plain. Here their Brigades, their Ranks embattled close, Determin'd to withstand th' advancing Foes, The Briton sawâtransported with the Sight, And bravely eager of decisive Fight, He swiftly forward march'd, but march'd in Pain, Lest proffer'd War the Gaul should not sustain; But to elude his Fury should retreat, The only way the Hero to defeat. He drewâhe brandish'd his victorious Sword, Blenheim, remember Blenheim, was the Word. That magick Sound the Cohorts did inspire, Their Courage rous'd, and set their Veins on Fire. With Blenheim ring the Hills and Vales around, Lovania's trembling Tow'rs reverberate the Sound. Unguided Muse, say whether dost thou stray, In Marlbro's rapid Vortex caught away, In the bright Eddy lost, and blind with too much Day? Stop thy ambitious Flight, and modest yield Thy Force unequal to Ramillia's Field; For thee the Theme is too sublime and bright, Thou art not us'd to climb so steep a Height, Nor can'st thou bear this Blaze, this Stress of Light Can'st thou, to Heav'n secure from sinking rise, And soar with Strength amidst superior Skies? Can'st thou supported with a vig'rous Wing, To list'ning Orbs around Ramillia sing, And make thro' ecchoing Spheres great Marlbro's Actions ring? Hast thou of noble Words a Stock immense, And Stores of rich inestimable Sense, To furnish all the Pow'r and Pomp of Eloquence? Warm Fancy and cool Judgment can'st thou show, Make Numbers charm, and Words like Colours glow? Then take the Lyre, and in a lofty Strain Sing Marlbro's Triumphs, sing Ramillia's Plain. But unprepar'd make not so rash a Choice; How sluggish is thy Wing? How weak thy Voice? Proportion'd Strength, Invention, Numbers, Skill, All Things to thee are wanting, but a Will. Be then advis'd, the strong Temptation fly, Nor vain, on thy unequal Strength rely; For this Attempt more unprovided far, Than German Circles, when engag'd in War. But since the Bards, whose Laurels spring and thrive By Malbro', shou'd to Marlbro' Tribute give; Shou'd to remotest Realms, their Envoy Fame Dispatch, their Hero's Triumphs to proclaim; Since Cam and Ouze, which from the Gaul's Alarms And thine, O Rome, sav'd by the Briton's Arms, Soft Peace enjoy, and gently murmuring flow, Should tell the World what they to Marlbro' owe, And since, superior in the Field, 'tis fit We should assert the Empire too of Wit, And make the haughty Gaul in both submit: To sing Ramillia's Field, ye Bards, awake; The tuneful Lyre, let none but Masters take. Ye Mercenary Wits, who rhime for Bread, Ye unfledg'd Muses, this high Subject dread. Let not th' Inferior Race, who can indite A pretty Prologue, or a Sonnet write, Tho' none so forward, none so bold as they, Make on this Theme an impotent Essay. All who can raise a Shed, must not presume To frame a Palace, or erect a Dome. No more let Milton's Imitator dare Torture our Language to torment the Ear, With Numbers harsher than the Din of War; Let him no more his horrid Muse employ In uncouth Strains, pure English to destroy, And from its Ruins yell his hideous Joy. Away ye Triflers, who all Rule disdain, Who in Pindarick sing Philander's Pain, And Camps and Arms in Pastor Fido's Strain. Hence vain Pretenders to the Song sublime, Turners of Verse, and Finishers of Rhime, Who think with Fame Immortal you are crown'd By flowing Numbers and harmonious Sound, That wanting Fire and mindless of Design, Ply hard the Pump, and labour every Line, To make, like empty Clouds, your Diction shine: So many Masters of this tuneful Skill, With their melodious Songs the Kingdom fill, That to compleat poetick Eloquence, Nothing's demanded, but Design and Sense. Yet of the few, who can with Judgment praise, And sing great Actions in becoming Lays, Let none, betray'd by generous Thirst of Fame, Adventure singly on this mighty Theme, Lest crush'd beneath th' unsufferable Weight, He curse th' ambitious Flame that caus'd his Fate, And learn his Error in his Fall too late. Let various Master Bards their Force unite, And with Confed'rate Art a Song indite; The Muses richest Treasures let them drain, Lavish their Genius, and exhaust their Vein; Let them this gen'rous Resolution own, That they are pleas'd and proud to be undone, While they adorn with all the Muses Charms, Bright Anna's Empire, and brave Churchill's Arms. Tho' any one unvulgar Bard might raise The Briton's Triumphs in superior Lays To my unfinish'd Lines and crude Essays; Yet a distinguish'd and consummate Piece Excelling that of Mantua, that of Greece, A wond'rous unexampled Epick Song, Where all is Just, and Beautiful, and Strong, Worthy of Anna's Arms and Marlbro's Fire, Does all our Bards associate Strength require. The Poets, who assume this noble Theme, Must have their Hero's Heat, their Hero's Flegme They must have Judgment to direct their Flight, Be never low, and never out of Sight. Calm they must be, and yet with equal Grace Enthusiastick in a proper Place. Then Offel for distinguish'd Lays renown'd, And Melden with repeated Laurels crown'd; Harmonious Shafton, of superior Name, Mola and Corbel of establish'd Fame, And tuneful Hugens, all great Sons of Art, For this high Task your utmost Strength exert; Let each his Genius know, each take his proper Part. Let Remus and Mocuto joyn'd preside, Correct your Labours, and your Progress guide: One is with all politer Science grac'd, Of Thoughts refin'd, and delicate of Taste; All to his Judgment as decisive fly, And by that Standard, all their Labours try: And one, like Rome's Immortal Angelo, Does rich and universal Genius show: This Master, this Poetick Architect, Can stately Domes and Palaces erect. The Painter too, and Sculptor in his Turn, He can the Building, which he rears, adorn. Let these sustain the chief Surveyor's Care: By these directed can the Poets err? The Age in Taste, grown curious to a Vice, (O that it were as Delicate as Nice!) And all contending Parties will submit To such a soveraign Court of Sense and Wit: Let those employ'd the Edifice to raise, Chuse some fam'd Hero worthy of their Praise; Whose conquering Arms in Albion's Annals shine, And let the Action suit the great Design. Ye Bards, let all the noble Scheme be wrought With Art and Care, and deep deliberate Thought. Before the Basis of the Work you lay, The ancient Plans of Greece and Rome survey: The Iliad and the Ãneid well inspect, All that is just, and bright; and great, select; You know their Errors, those you will correct; With due Connexion let the Parts cohere, Lean on each other, and each other bear: Let Order, Rule and Symetry proclaim The artful Wonders of the happy Frame. Believe no Cost too great, but every where Let Plenty, Wealth, Magnificence appear. A Plan so firm, so beautiful contrive, As may the Critick mock, and Time survive: A nobler Subject will your Care employ, Than Latian Conquests, or the Wars of Troy. Let the stupend'ous everlasting Pile, Worthy of Anna's Name and Marlbro's Toil, The Glory of Ramilla's Field sustain, Longer than Woodstock's Tow'rs can that of Blenheim's Plain Be you, appointed to adorn the Song, Daring with Care, with Delicacy strong. Let Mantuan Judgment and Horatian Words, The generous Fire which tuneful Greece affords, And all the Beauties that in Spencer shine, To form your Diction's Dignity combine. Join to the purest Words and strength of Sense, The utmost Pride and Force of Eloquence; And all the bold and happy Images, Which by their master strokes amaze and please. Let Episodes, contriv'd with Art, surprize, Which from the Subject unconstrain'd arise; Like Walks and Gardens ravishing to sight, And Pleasure Houses, let 'em give Delight. In your Machines you will no Gods employ, Who by the Poet listed fought at Troy. The Pagan Gods become a Pagan Scheme, But will they too adorn a Christian Theme? Can you Concern or Admiration move, By introducing Pallas, Mars, or Jove? No more than Indian Pagods, Jove we fear, And Mars no more than Mahomet revere; Yet should you these employ to grace your Plan, You may the Indian please, or Musselman; The Christian, who reflects, you never can. When you the Briton's Character pursue, Design Ãneas and Achilles too, Else you but half the Hero set in view. Let him in Steel, bright as Achilles, shine; Give him his God-like Port, his Arms Divine. So let his Mien and martial Charms surprize, Let such a Flame irradiate his Eyes; Make him to Fight, like that brave Greek, advance; So wave his Sword, so grasp his trembling Lance: With such an Ardour and intrepid Air To Danger fly, and plunge amidst the War. Make him augment the Dyle with hostile Blood, As the Greek Hero dy'd Scamander's Flood. Then Marlbro' draw; (for Poets too can paint, And never Lights, or Shades, or Colours want) And give his Picture when engag'd in Fight, Let him with glorious Slaughter smear'd affright, And please at once with terrible Delight. But by the fam'd Achilles, Poets, know The Briton's Courage you imperfect show; Fierce is the Greek, and rugged as the Age, And next to brutal is his martial Rage. Churchill is brave, serene, unstain'd with Pride, And to angelick Warriors more ally'd. If you would Justice to the Hero do, In a true Light would you his Valour shew; Delineate Fury mix'd with god-like Grace, And Indignation in a Seraph's Face. Describe the Leader of the Guards above, Tell how he charg'd, how he in Battel strove, And o'er the Plains of Heav'n the vanquish'd Rebels drove Then let the Hero's Character be crown'd, With all the Vertues in Ãneas found. Give him his pious Mind, his generous Heart, Leave out his boastful and ungallant Part, In Marlbro' none can these Defects assert. Did the good Trojan bear his aged Sire, On his strong Shoulders from the raging Fire; Marlbro' on his, sustains a nobler Weight, His Kindred's, Country's, and Europa's Fate. The Heads by me suggested to your Muse, And those that you with more Success shall chuse, As Epick Laws demand, should be express'd In proper Types, and in Allusion dress'd: You'll thus the Soul with greater Pleasure strike, By side Advances and by Views oblique: Tell how the Prince, who to retrieve his Fame, From Boian Fields to Belgia's Region came, To make the Dole and fair Ramillia clear The Danube's Debt, and Blenheim's vast Arrear; Eager of Conquest to the Battel flies, Revenge and Fury flashing in his Eyes. As when a Panther has, with generous Pride, His Strength in Combat with the Lion try'd, And quickly vanquish'd by superior Might, Sore maim'd and wounded, sav'd himself by Flight, If when grown whole he meets the mighty Foe, His Hair's erected and his Eye-Balls glow: Fierce he extends his Paws, then threatning stands, And with revengeful Looks new War demands. He recollects, to animate his Flame, His painful Wounds, and yet more painful Shame; In Combat then once more his Fortune tries, And for Repair to greater Ruin flies. The Boian soâYe Bards, forgive me, you A nobler Image of that Prince will shew. Tell how the Gallick General was distress'd, What Grief, what vast Disturbance fill'd his Breast, When first he saw the plying Cohorts yield, And to th' advancing Briton quit the Field. Tell how amidst the trembling Troops he flies, With Tears and Fury mingled in his Eyes. How to prevent their Flight and his Defeat, He some did menace, and did some intreat: How he exclaim'd aloud amidst the Host, Oh Gallia! have thy Sons their Courage lost? By Gallia's Safety, and your Monarch's Name, By your past Deeds and military Fame, ReturnâBe for your Lives and Honour brave, Your King, your Country, and your Altars save. In vainâThe Franks unable to sustain Unequal Fight, forsook the fatal Plain. Tell the Distraction, tell the dreadful Cry Of Gallia's pale Battalions, while they fly. Describe their haughty Leader's troubled Air, Born down th' impetuous Tide of refluent War. But first to form this Image strong and true, In Raphael's famous Piece Maxentius view, Whom a great Briton did, like This, pursue. Observe him plung'd in Tyber's rapid Tide, Remark his sullen Rage, and melancholy Pride; His vast Amazement, Anguish, Horror, Care, And Indignation finish'd by Despair. See how he frowns, like a black Tempest driv'n By warring Winds thro' the blue Chace of Heav'n. Of Vill'roy in his Flight this Picture give, In his wild Looks let all these Passions strive; Let Marlbro' on his Rear conspicuous shine, Make him advance like Raphael's Constantine: Give him his Ardour and Majestick Grace, And all the martial Beauties of his Face; Give him a noble, unaffected Mien, Sedate in Triumph, as in Fight serene. Give him the Conqueror's and the Judge's Air, Oblig'd to punish, tho' inclin'd to spare. So the destroying Angels look'd, who came To cast on Sodom's Tow'rs destructive Flame: Reluctant they their fatal Arms employ, With Pity touch'd, and backward to destroy: They would have spar'd, they would have Mercy shown, Had not her Crimes to full Perfection grown, Extorted Wrath, and pull'd Destruction down. Since I the mighty Constantine have nam'd, Renown'd in Arms, for Moderation fam'd, A Christian Hero, and a Briton born, Why may not he, ye Bards, the Song adorn? May not this Warrior be your noble Theme, A proper Hero for your Epick Scheme? In this illustrious Leader, may not you Brave Marlbro's Picture with Applause pursue? The Piety and Love to Human Kind, Which fill'd, great Constantine, thy generous Mind, Are the same Vertues we in Marlbro' find. Did not thy States and Subject Realms, O Rome, From Constantine's fam'd Arms expect their Doom? Like vast Events on Marlbro's Progress wait, Whose Sword, Europa, will decide thy Fate. In this, 'tis true, the Heroes different are, One gain'd an Empire by successful War; One greater Glory wins, who by his Sword Reduces Countries for their rightful Lord. In some fit Place, which you know best to chuse, Describe a Traveller, who in Paris views The Street, in which the Gaul's proud Statue stands, And Veneration from the Crowd demands. Let the disdainful Stranger point and say, How swift, amazing Change! is thy Decay? The strong Foundations, which thy Pride sustain, Break with the Thunder of Ramillia's Plain. The Tow'rs around thee tremble at th' Alarms Of Anna's Anger, and her General's Arms. The Briton's blasting Flame thy Head invades, Thy Laurels wither, and thy Glory fades; This impious Scene of Pride must change its Name, No more the Place of Vict'ry, but of Shame. See, the resistless Briton's Troops advance, Europe's Deliv'rer, and the Scourge of France: He'll of its Honours strip thy haughty Head, And on thy ruin'd Glory scornful tread: The States and Cities, which in Fetters bound At thy triumphant Feet here lie around, Th' immortal Foe of Tyrants shall release, Unchain thy Slaves, and give Europa Peace. You the Narration will so well dispose, That all the great Campaign you may disclose; Tell all the Wonders done on Belgia's Plain, The Countries conquer'd, and the Numbers slain, In the short Compass of one Lunar Year: Superior Orbs run swifter their Career. In a few Days such Actions are atchiev'd, As will with Pain hereafter be believ'd. One Month so full of Miracles contains, The mighty Deeds of many great Campaigns; While Churchill's swift illustrious Steps out-shine Thy Progress, CÃ¦sar, and Adolphus, Thine. So thick, so great, the confluent Triumphs come, Confin'd and crowded in such narrow room, That these bright Weeks redundant Fame bestow, And with high Tides of Glory over-flow. If you in Hangings or in Painting shew, For that an Epick Song may fitly do, What Tow'rs, what Lands, what stately Cities yield, To crown the Labour of Ramillia's Field; Let her high Gates Lovania open lay, Receive the Conqueror, and Protection pray. Then to Brussella let his Arms advance, Driving along the frighted Herds of France. Pour'd from the Gates of fair Brabantia's Head, Of rescu'd Captives let a Deluge spread; Let them in joyful Throngs the Briton meet, Bless their Deliv'rer, and embrace his Feet; Whose Sword releas'd by one amazing Stroke, Their Feet from Gallia's Chains, their Necks from Gallia's Yoke Describe him entring high Brussella's Gate, Mid'st loud Applauses in Triumphal State, Express his Godlike, unelated Air: (Who so can Conquer, who so Conquest bear?) Th' Illustrious Vertues which in Marlbro' shone, As once the Glory that did Moses crown, Dazzled the Crowd, but were to him unknown Let all the eager Belgians throng to see The mighty Chief that set their Nation free, The Fence of Europe's Rights, the Prop of Liberty Let Princes, Lords and Counsellors of State, Augment the Pomp, and on the Triumph wait; Let 'em deliver to the Conqueror's Hand Their Keys, and all their Ensigns of Command. Shew all the Ways of fair Brabantia's Soil, With Travellers throng'd, and smoaking with the Toil Of Prelates, Princes, Magistrates Supream, Great Soveraign States, and Lords of mighty Name: Let some from fair Mechlina's Tow'rs, and some Pour'd from the Gates of fam'd Antwerpia come. Be these from Bruges, those from spacious Ghent, From Oud'nard part, and part from Lier sent. From every Region let a num'rous Train Fill every Road, and cover every Plain. Panting in Clouds of Dust and bath'd in Sweat, Let 'em advance to high Brussella's Gate; In grateful Accents there the Hero greet, And throw themselves obedient at his Feet. Let 'em his Favour and his Aid implore, And to be safe, resign to him their Pow'r. Thus Marlbro's Arms excel ev'n CÃ¦sar's Fame, Conqu'ring e'er yet he saw, e'er yet he came. You in your Plan will leave capacious Room For promis'd Triumphs, and great Deeds to come: What a luxuriant Harvest of Renown, What full ripe Glory will the Autumn crown, Since early Seeds so thick, so ripe appear, That Fame a nobler Bloom did never wear, Nor pregnant Time Events of more Importance bear. While I so near, so long the Hero view, And Hints suggest to be improv'd by you, My waning Flame does in my Veins renew. I feel an inward Impulse not unknown; Urging your Muse I have provok'd my own. Oh! did a Portion of the noble Fire, With which the Hero fought, my Breast inspire; I'd raise my Voice, and with a lofty Strain, Would to Etherial Fields uplift Ramillia's Plain. I from the Roman's Brow would win the Bays, And soaring high excel the Grecian's Lays: The Trojan Chief should to the Briton yield, And Latian Triumphs to Ramillia's Field; Scamander's Flood should own superior Dyle, And, Greece, thy Deeds submit to Marlbro's Toil. 'Tis doneâI've compass'd my ambitious Aim, The Hero's Fire restores the Poet's Flame; The Inspiration comes, my Bosom glows, I strive with strong Enthusiastick Throws. Oh! I am all in Rapture, all on Fire, Give me to ease extatick Pangs, the Lyre: How can a Muse, that Albion loves, forbear To sing the Wonders of the glorious War? I riseâO whither am I caught away? I mount, and must the tow'ring Muse obey; I cut the Space immense, and reach the Source of Day. Where will the Flight, where will the Labour end! Thro' the steep Gulph I to the Stars ascend; Stars which I now behold vast Orbs of Light; Only by Distance, little to the Sight: All Suns of equal Bulk and equal Flame With that, which rules the World from whence I came; All glorious Centers, whose attractive Sway, Revolving Moons and wandring Orbs obey. Amazing Prospect! ravishing Delight! How vastly great they are? How dazling bright? In beauteous Order, how they hang around? Good Heav'nâBut harkâI hear an ecchoing Sound. It does from Sphere to Sphere, from World to World rebound! The Noise augments, attend; it seems to rise From Belgia's Landâhark, how it fills the Skies. This mighty Noise is Triumph, 'tis Applause, A loud Rejoycing for some Victor Cause; 'Tis knownâAttentive I these Accents clear, Arms, Anna, Marlbro', Dyle, Ramillia hear. But see, with radiant Wings, see yonder flies, With Joy, and News important in his Eyes, A heav'nly Envoy, glorious to the Sight; How bright, how strong, how swift he wings his Flight! How mild a Glory, what a circling Ray Does the celestial Youth around display? His chearful Looks declare some great Success; I follow, I attend the bright Express: With him I climb the steep Celestial Height, Swift as an Angel's is the Muse's Flight: We now arrive at Heav'n's eternal Gate, Where shining Guards in Arms immortal wait; Who thronging round Heav'n's Minister, demand What happy Tydings from the Belgian Land, Of Albion's General, Guardian Seraph, say What great Events, and what new Triumphs pay The noble Labour of Ramillia's Day? That Chief, the beamy Messenger replies, Who on the Justice of his Cause relies, His prosp'rous Ensigns daily does advance, To sink the Pride, and break the Pow'r of France. The Victor's Arms before him all Things bear, Like Torrents in the Hills, or Tempests in the Air. The stately Cities which Brabantia crown, And Flandria's Tow'rs their rightful Sovereign own, And from their Necks proud Gallia's Yoke have thrown. Hark, now I hear the Shouts of Joy around; I hear the Triumph's multiplying Sound; Th' Angelick Acclamations grow, and fill Each azure Plain, and every crystal Hill. They shew by this repeated loud Applause, Those fight in Heaven's, who fight in Anna's Cause. The Shouts of Joy diminish; but behold, Yon Seraph takes his Harp of heav'nly Gold; Hark, the bless'd Poet of the glorious Choir Begins, he strikes his bright celestial Lyre. How the Terrestrial Lucifer, The Son of Pride, the haughty Gaul, Does from his high Imperial Sphere, Struck with Britannia's Thunder, fall! Th' Almighty gave his high Command, From all the Hills and Tow'rs of Belgia's Land, Hang out the Flag, and let the Banner stream, Terror denounce, and growing War proclaim: Call forth my Warriors from Batavia's Soil, My Generals from Britannia's Isle; Warriors to whom proud Tyrants yield, To Gallia known at Blenheim's Field. Warriors, who only Godlike Fame respect, Despise the Danger, and the Spoil neglect. Let confluent Cohorts crown the Mountain's Head, And o'er the Plain a Martial Deluge spread; Let them extend their Front, collect their Rear, And dreadful on their March appear. Lutetia tremble, see the Clouds arise, The Tempest darkens all the Skies, It will Destruction on thy Head unload, And spread th' Almighty's Terrors far abroad; Justice no longer will delay, But will its Debt of Vengeance pay. Aspiring City, which exalted high, Did'st with Celestial Stars in Lustre vie; And mad with Pride, wert wont to say, Europa's Realms shall my Commands obey; The ruin'd Nations woful Cries, The Widows Tears and Orphans Sighs, The Seas of Blood, by thy Ambition spilt, (Dire Tokens of enormous Guilt!) Provoke just Heav'n on thy proud Head to pour Fury fermented high, and as thy Crimes mature: See, drench'd with Wrath Divine, the Tyrant reels, What Anguish, what Distress he feels? Against the Gaul, th' Almighty does declare, Against th' Oppressor he denounces War. His lifted Arm descends with ling'ring Sway, But heavier Strokes will recompence Delay. Bearing his glitt'ring Sword, and Sun-like Shield, The Lord of Armies takes the Field; Grasping his bright Immortal Lance, He does to Belgia's Plain advance. The Earth's Foundations quake, the Mountains bow And frighted Rivers backward flow: Nature's strong Fears and vast Distress, The awful Presence of her Lord confess. Torrents of Glory his dread March proclaim, Clouds and thick Darkness, and tempestuous Flame. The Gaul before his Terrors flies; A hideous Yell, and lamentable Cries, Of routed Warriors fill the Skies. How red with Slaughter is Ramillia's Plain? How are the Mountains cover'd with the Slain? How deeply dy'd with Gallick Blood, Belgia's polluted Rivers roll their Flood? Ye Flandrian Hills and Tow'rs around, For you beheld the Field, and heard the Sound Of Arms, and Combat from the Skies rebound, And saw Britannia's Foes subdu'd in Fight, Their Rout intire, and Ignominious Flight; Tell how against the Gaul the Battel turn'd, How from the Field their Cohorts fled, Like scatt'ring Flocks upon the Mountain's Head; How Albion's Captain, dreadfully adorn'd With Dust and Slaughter, did pursue, How on the Rear he hung, and how his Terrors flew. The Gallick Gen'rals Looks relate, Enrag'd and cursing their amazing Fate, Their Consternation and their Woe declare, For you their Anguish saw, and absolute Despair. Let us in rapt'rous Hallelujahs sing The Praises of th' Eternal King, Who sits above the Empyrean Height, Enthron'd in Uncreated Light. He, by his Servant Anna's Hand, On Dola's Flood in Belgia's Land, Has the proud Oppressor broke, Who his just Vengeance did so long provoke: The hardy Deed will Men below surprize, 'Tis wond'rous too in Seraphs Eyes; This mighty Work of Providence Divine, In Earth's and Heav'ns Records shall shine. Blest be Ramillia's Plain, that gave Ease to th' Oppress'd, and Freedom to the Slave: That has rebuk'd th' ambitious Gaul; A glorious Promise of th' Tyrant's Fall. May'st thou with flow'ry Honours crown'd, With Natures richest Gifts abound; May Genial Show'rs, and Heav'nly Dew, Thy verdant Pleasures still renew: Let not the cruel Ploughshare wound, Nor the sharp Harrow tear thy Ground; Let thy prolifick, but unlabour'd Soil, Enrich the Farmer, and prevent his Toil: Unconscious of inclement Skies, Be neither chill'd with Cold, nor scorch'd with Heat, Let no destructive Meteor rise, Nor Tempest on thy peaceful Region beat. Let not thy Glebe produce a Weed, Thy Caverns no raw Vapours feed, Nor spotted Plague or Pestilential Seed. Unfading Bloom and vernal Verdure wear, And with spontaneous Plenty blest, Like Eden's happy Garden rest, Thy Soil as fruitful, and as mild thy Air. Be this its Fate, for this auspicious Plain Plain Has sunk th' Oppressor's Hopes, and broke Europa's Chain Now, Dola, thou before a vulgar Stream, Among the noblest Floods shalt have a Name; Danaw alone shall Rival thee, And Thames alone superior be. Auspicious Chief, thy great Designs pursue, Defend the Suff'rer, and the Proud subdue, Till by Defect of Foes thy Triumphs cease, And grateful Europe thank thee for her Peace: Then, 'midst Applauses of the Realms restor'd, And Nations sav'd by thy Victorious Sword; Return Triumphant to thy Native Soil, To honourable Ease, from glorious Toil. Let Anna then, with a just Umpire's Hand, Of Europe's Pow'r, the balanc'd Scales command: May she ambitious Monarchies restrain, Religion guard, and Publick Right maintain; Let her be dear at Home, Abroad rever'd, By all good Princes lov'd, and by all Tyrants fear'd. INSTRUCTIONS TO VANDER BANK. A Sequel to the Advice to the POETS. A POEM Occasioned by the Glorious Success of Her Majesty's Arms, under the Conduct of the Duke of Marlborough, the last Year in Flanders. Printed in the Year 1709. Have all thy Bards, Britannia, spent the'r Vein, Not one rich Genius left, that can sustain Th' expensive Task of Marlbro's last Campaign? Ruin'd by Conquests, do they pray for Peace, That the hard Taxes on the Muse may cease? Thou, Artist, who dost Nature's Face express In Silk and Gold, and Scenes of Action dress; Dost figur'd Arras animated leave, Spin a bright Story, or a Passion weave, By mingling Threads, canst mingle Shades and Light, Delineate Triumphs, or describe a Fight; Do thou relate the Hero's Toil, record The new Atchievements of his matchless Sword. Since some illustrious Patron thou wilt need, If Ann propitious smiles, thou must succeed; Her high Command inspir'd with martial Flame The Warrior's Breast, she by her pow'rful Name Prepar'd half beaten Foes to yield the Day, And for advancing Vict'ries made the Way. Belgian attend; and from thy noble Loom, Let the great Chief August in Triumph come. For Blenheim's lofty Rooms the Work design, In every Piece let Art and Labour shine: Let glorious Deeds the Briton's Palace crown, Not those of ancient Hero's, but his own. In the bright Series of his Story show, What Albion, what Mankind, to Marlbro' owe. I only rude Materials can suggest, Some by thy Art too hard to be express'd, Chuse what are proper, and neglect the rest. If thou with Care, and that thy Genius may, Improve these Hints, refine this crude Essay, Thou may'st Illustrious, lasting Scenes contrive, At least the Work will by its Subject live. Let the first Labour on this lofty Theme, Express the Chief on Scalda's wondring Stream; From him that Flood immortal Fame derives, Rivals the Danube, and with Dola strives. Describe his Steed, not patient of the Rein, Champing his Foam, and bounding on the Plain; Arch his high Neck, and graceful spread his Mane. Give ample Nostrils breathing inbred Fire, Eyes that confess the gen'rous Mare and Sire, Such Life and Pride, as in the Race appear, Which Arab Lords and Persian Monarchs bear. But with their chief Delight our Eyes to feed, Mount the brave Leader on his manag'd Steed: Give him a noble Seat, a Martial Mien, Scornful of Danger, and in Arms serene. Let his Right Hand his Sword vindictive Sway, Grasp'd with vast Strength, and spreading dreadful Day By which the Tyrant Monsters are destroy'd, Who fill'd with Riot, and with Rapine cloy'd, Oppression's howling Wilderness defend, And Desolation's empty Realms extend. The Looks of Justice to the Warrior give, Where Wrath and Mercy for Dominion strive; Intrepid Ardour well to Gallia known, Heroick Grace, the mighty Briton's own. When you express the Leader's Face and Eyes, Studious with daring Labour to surprize, Could you with in-wrought Glory charm the Sight, And interwoven Threads of manag'd Light, You might succeed, and do the Conqueror Right. Let Fame and Vict'ry in inferior Sky, Hover with balanc'd Wings, and smiling fly Above his Head, and on his Fauchion wait Assiduous, to pronounce Europa's Fate. On th' adverse Banks of Scalda's silver Tide, Delineate Gallia's military Pride: Express her Cohorts covering all the Plain, Thick as the Waves, that spread the troubled Main: Show them advancing swift to Ganda's Walls, Where Lesia's Current into Scalda falls; Till Marlbro's Marches did their Speed outgo, And made them stop to face th' impending Foe. So when a Stag, Lord of the Herd, endow'd With beauteous Limbs, and of high Antlets proud, Hears the shrill Horn, and hallowing Huntsmens Cries Ring thro' the Forrest and embroil the Skies, Trusting his Feet, more rapid than the Wind, He flies, and leaves the clam'rous Band behind; Till spent, he stands at Bay, erects his Face, And to a Fight decrees to change the Chace; Determin'd now, he does th' Invader dare, And feels unusual Courage from Despair. O Belgian, work a Piece by this Cartone, And be this Picture by thy Art out-done: For confluent Nations spread a spacious Loom, And give the mighty Host sufficient room, Where more Brigades form each extended Wing; Than Eastern Monarchs e'er to Combat bring: Let the wide Van, and deep unnumber'd Rear, Exuberant War, and Strength immense appear. Here let the Flow'r and Pride of Spain advance, And there the Belgian Slaves, that courted France. Let the Helvetian martial Youth compose The threatning Front, fierce mercenary Foes, Who trade in Blood and Rapine; let the Gaul Back to the Rear, a safer Station, fall. Show how the Chief sprung ardent to the War, In Arms refulgent, as the Morning Star; And if the Task be not unequals found To Looms for Master-Skill the most renown'd, The Hero is distinct Compartments show, Supporting here his Friends, and breaking there the Foe. Let him in every Place surprize the Sight, As if dispers'd and multiply'd in Fight, And as the Leader, watchful to protect His Squadrons, did Ubiquity affect. Here let him stand intrepid and sedate, Dispensing high Commands and certain Fate; There let his Arm his reeking Fauchion wield, Triumph in Slaughter, and pollute the Field With glorious Spoil; while, like the fabled God Of War, thro' thick embattled Deaths he rode. Let him the Vale with Rout and Ruin fill, Like Torrents rushing from an Alpine Hill, Or a high Wind, that o'er the Desart sweeps, Lays waste the Woods, and rolls the Sand in heaps. Where his destructive Sword the Foe pursu'd, Express the Lanes the glitt'ring Feller hew'd; Let Streams of Blood the Victor's Wrath attest, A purple Vintage from the Slain express'd. Show Warriors quiv'ring in the Pangs of Death, Rolling their Eyes, and gasping doubtful Breath; While scatter'd Arms, and Horse and Horse-men slain, An ignominious Medly, spread the Plain: Weave Desolation, let prodigious Waste, And Tracks of Death mark where the Victor pass'd, As Conflagrations are by Ruin trac'd. On a new Scene attentive Care bestow, A Princely Youth in polish'd Armour show: Let him advance, and as a Seraph bright, Ravish at once and terrify the Sight: Place him conspicuous mid'st the hostile Troops, Hanover's Pride, and Albion's distant Hopes; Whose early Deeds and blossoming Renown, To wond'ring Europe have the Hero shown. With strong Impatience let him seek the Fight, Eager of Fame, and trembling with Delight. As when the Eaglet, which the Parent tries, Not us'd to soar, nor conscious of the Skies, Against the strongest Radiance of the Sun Mounts bold, and makes the genuine Offspring known; So the young Chief undazled, fac'd the Charms Of martial Glory, and the Blaze of Arms; Thro' glitt'ring Deaths, and Storms of Smoke and Flame, Ardent aspir'd to the bright Mark of Fame, And made his first Effort his high Descent proclaim. Show how he flew intrepid to the Foe, Plung'd mid'st the Host, and forc'd his Passage thro': How the brave Youth with Vet'ran Captains vy'd; What Trophies crown'd a Sword, till then untry'd. So a young Lion, of his matchless Might Yet ignorant, but grown mature for Fight; If he by chance a shaggy Bear descries, Determin'd to the Combat, rapid flies: Lashing his Sides he roars, and from afar, Thro' ecchoing Hills denounces dreadful War; And soon victorious in his first Campaign, The yellow Warrior, Master of the Plain, Conscious what mighty Strength he had in Store, Wonders, and grieves, he try'd it not before. Then let Germania's Angel, and his own, Each bearing high a Shield and Laurel Crown, Fly watchful o'er his Head, with one to guard His Life, with one his Valour to reward. Artist, record how fair Britannia's Isle, When first she heard the Youth's advent'rous Toil, Scarce pleas'd with Glory from too daring Fight, Felt proffer'd Joy suspended by Affright; While her tall Oaks shook on the Mountain's Brow, And refluent Streams did Consternation show. Work a new Piece, describe the Gallick Pow'rs, Quitting the Field to reach Gandava's Tow'rs: Concern and Trouble in their Eyes express, Finish'd Confusion, and extream Distress; Unfeign'd Amazement, Horror, anxious Care, And the wild Looks and Features of Despair. Show how the Generals to restore the Fight, Confirm their Legions, and prevent their Flight; Asham'd, enrag'd, and griev'd, did These upbraid, Encourage Those, some menace, some perswade; While all their Efforts unavailing were; Idle their Threats, and fruitless was their Pray'r; What Words can charm inexorable Fear? Can Terror listen? Can Distraction hear? Show how the Gaul's disorder'd Cohorts fled, Express their Anguish and perplexing Dread, While Horse and Foot strove each to have the Van, And Chiefs Companions of the private Man, Inglorious Flight! disregimented ran. So when incumbent Tempests press the Deep, And rouse the frighted Billows from their Sleep; The liquid Legions crowding, fly so fast, And shove each other with such headlong haste, That sometimes they are rid, and sometimes ride, By Turns exalt their Heads, by Turns subside, O'erwhelm each other, and distract the Tide. Show how the General, whom the Gauls adore, To Belgia's Plains, call'd from Hesperia's Shore, Gallia's declining Empire to restore, Instruct her Troops, new Laurels to acquire, And in their Breasts rekindle Martial Fire, Did to the common Fate reluctant yield, And with his routed Army left the Field: He blam'd the Stars, that on his Conduct frown'd, And, Marlbro', thy superior Genius own'd. So a fierce Boar on Mauritania's Plain, The Lyon's Fury does a while sustain, Till torn and sunk with vast Expence of Blood, He quits the Field, and seeks the shelt'ring Wood; He grinds his Teeth, impatient of Defeat, Indignant foams, fain would the Strife repeat, Looks back and threatens in his sour Retreat. Then show the Conqu'ror in another Scene, Protecting with his Arms the brave Eugene, While he the matchless Strength of Lisle assail'd, And o'er her Tow'rs with loud Applause prevail'd. Witness ye six times Twenty Thousand Gauls, Who then advanc'd near Lilla's lofty Walls To face the Foe, were honour'd with the Sight Of the brave Cohorts, which you felt in Fight: Witness ye Generals, and ye Princes, proud Of Veins distended with Imperial Blood; For You Spectators of the Action stood. Next let the Chief advance to Scalda's Banks, To drive th' unactive Gaul, whose Warlike Ranks Spread thick as Locusts on the adverse Side, Did in their Guardian Flood and Lines confide. 'Tis doneâFor when the Out-guards saw from: The Briton's Arms, and cry'd prepare for War, The Hearts of boastful Chiefs inglorious melt, And their cold Breasts their well-known Passion felt, Assur'd no more, while Marlbro's Sword invades By Rivers, Works, and numberless Brigades, As Terror dictates, they direct their Flight, Spread all the Plain with Marks of wild Affright, And ignominious Rout, but none of Fight. Let Churchill next, his conqu'ring Cohorts lead, To save Brussella, fair Brabantia's Head; To break th' united Arms of France and Spain, And make the Threats of proud Bavaria vain. Shew how the Foe the Scheld's Contagion caught, Gave cheap Renown, and left the Field unfought; And how the Boian Prince enrag'd to find, The Laurels blasted, for his Brow design'd; With troubled Pride, and Anguish in his Eyes, Chas'd a Third Time, before the Briton flies. He curs'd the Victor, who his Arms repell'd, And cruel Fate, that still Success with-held, But more the Coward Guardians of the Scheld. So when a rav'ning Wolf has long patroul'd, And found at length a Place to leap the Fold, He seems already of his Prey possest, And licks his Jaws, preluding to the Feast; If then the Master-Shepherd with his Band Arrives, their brandish'd Weapons in their Hand, The prowling Robber shuns unequal Fight, And grins, and growls, and rages in his Flight. While Gallia's Canton'd Troops inglorious rest, With frequent Flight, and fruitless Toil opprest; O Britain! thy great Chief his Ease denies, Patient of Labour and inclement Skies, He with new Ardour to new Conquest flies. Here fresh Materials for the Loom prepare, And weave a cold, white Winter-Piece of War: Ev'n then a Bloom of spreading Glory show, And verdant Laurels forc'd from Beds of Snow. Confed'rate Pow'rs of Flandria, Gallia, Spain, A num'rous Army destin'd to sustain Th' invading Foe, did Ganda's Walls maintain. Much in their Lines, and in the River's Tide, Much in their Chiefs and Numbers, they confide, But trusted more to Frosts and Ice, than Arms, To guard their City from the Foes Alarms; They hop'd that Tempests, arm'd with Snow and Sleet, Winds that from Hyperborean Mountains beat, With furious Wings the bleak untrodden Plain, And crystal Desarts of the frozen Main, And all th' embattled Meteors would conspire, To charge and force the Briton to retire: In vainâEv'n then, the Hero undismay'd, Advanc'd his Ensigns, and his Wrath display'd; Against perfidious Ghent his Batt'ry rear'd, And Winter Thunder for her Walls prepar'd, The Gallick Generals saw, and Marlbro's Arms rever'd. To pay due Honour to their Royal Head Burgundia's Lord, they in his Foot-steps tread; Of Gallia's Blood Effusion to decline, Yield without Combat, and the Town resign. Now Marlbro's Deeds ring thro' the Belgian Skies, And swift their Terror propagated flies; Soon did it reach the list'ning Towns around, How Bruga's Turrets trembled at the Sound? How frighted, how amaz'd the Warriors stood, Their Sinews slacken'd and congeal'd their Blood? Show, Artist, how their Cohorts, wing'd with Fear, Fled from the Foe, e'er yet he did appear. Thus Churchill sends abroad his conqu'ring Name, And wounds at Distance by his missive Fame. So oft, when Storms from Barbary's Sun-burnt Soil, Advance impetuous, and the Deep embroil; The rushing Waves th' Infection swift convey, And by their Flight distract Hesperia's Sea, Which rolls and works beneath a Sky serene, Disturb'd by Winds unheard, and Clouds unseen. Then show how Bruga's Counsellors of State, And Lords deputed, on the Briton wait, To make their low Submission, and implore His Mercy to protect them from his Pow'r. The Hero's Triumphs equal thus appear, Crowning alike each Season of the Year. Ev'n Winter's self, whose frozen, hoary Head Was ne'er before with martial Honours spread, For want of Deeds Illustrious, can't complain, Sharing the Glory of this great Campaign. An Arch of Triumph in another Piece, Artist, contrive, like those of Rome and Greece. What Master-Sculptors form in Base Relieve, Do thou in bold expressive Figures weave. Let Horsemen first in long Procession bear The glorious Trophies high display'd in Air, Bavaria's Standards, Emblems of the Fall Of Neighbour Pow'rs, that aid the faithless Gaul: False Flandria's Colours, and Castilia's Pride, And with thy Warrior's Blood, vain King, thy Lillies dy'd. Next let the Train bring on the Spoils of France, Augment the Triumph, and in Turn advance. Describe them lab'ring with th' unweildy Prize, Their tortur'd Sinews, and their starting Eyes; Let them beneath their rich Oppression bow, And seem to groan and stagger as they go. Shew, how the Throng with Hands upheld adore Justice Divine, that has by Anna's Pow'r Compell'd the Gaul his Rapine to restore; That has aveng'd the injur'd Nations round, Curb'd lawless Might, and proud Ambition bound. In a high Car the laurell'd Victor place, Drawn by the noblest Steeds of Belgia's Race, Thro' deep applauding Crowds on either Side Sublime, yet unelated, let him ride. The Seraph Chiefs such Moderation shew'd, When to the Gates of Hell their Host pursu'd The Rebel Pow'rs, and thro' th' unlightsome Way Return'd in Triumph to the Coasts of Day. Of various Nations let a confluent Throng Hang on his Wheels, as slow they roll along. Let them, like crowding Waves, each other press, And strain their eager Eyes to see and bless. Add to the martial Pomp an endless Train Of Warrior-Slaves, that drag the Conqu'ror's Chain: Let Lords and Chiefs, impatient of Disgrace, With haughty Trouble, melancholly Pace, And sullen Shame, bear the hard Fate of War, And pant amidst the Crowd behind the Hero's Car. Let high Augusta's Sons transported meet, And with loud Joy th' advancing Victor greet; And let her Speaker for superior Sense Renown'd, as well as charming Eloquence, The solemn Progress of the Triumph stay, While publick Thanks his Words to Marlbro' pay. Then let the Bards in humble Manner stand With Distichs, Sonnets, Prologues in their Hand, In Marlbro's Praiseâ'Tis all alass we know That from their dry exhausted Springs can flow. Let all the Pomp of Decoration grace The high Pillasters and the Structure's Face: Let curious Mottos, Hieroglyphick Art And mystick Emblems shine on every Part. Here Liberty in all her heav'nly Charms; With her gay Offspring Plenty in her Arms, With chearful Looks and humble Gesture may. Embrace the Victor's Feet, and Homage pay, Who broke her Chains, restor'd her Rights Divine And in her Native Beauties bade her shine. There, to extend the Briton's just Renown, Show Dungeons open'd, Prisons broken down, Fetters and Chains in Heaps neglected thrown Which late tormented Slaves and Captives wore. But which, auspicious Day! they wear no more Let shouting Throngs of these deliver'd Slaves, Frequent as sailing Clouds, or rolling Waves, With Flow'rs and verdant Branches spread his Rod And prostrate kiss the Ground the Victor trod. Then raise in Piles the Gibbet, Rack and Wheel, And all the Tortures wrought of Cord or Steel Plenty of Death, and Luxury of Pain, Which Master Tyrants from their fertile Brain And curst Projectors of Destruction find, Curious in Torment to afflict Mankind. Let these congested Engines, set on Fire By Marlbro's generous Hand, in Flames expire: Let them as Marks of publick Joy arise, And with applauded Ruin fill the Skies, To Heav'n and Liberty a grateful Sacrifice. Attempt another noble Work, and raise A lofty Column to the Hero's Praise. Tho' high Augusta's Sons, who still reveal In Liberty's Defence an ardent Zeal, Studious of Truth and Justice ne'er adore Thy Altars, Rome, nor Gallia's lawless Pow'r, May, as they ought, a stately Pillar rear, That shall the Victor's Weight of Glory bear; Yet, Belgian, still do thou thy Task pursue, For should not all the Arts conspire to shew To the Great Briton's Deeds the Honours due? Then with the Sculptor and the Architect, Artist, contend, and the proud Pile erect. With Marlbro's wond'rous Story fill the Space Between the Spires, which the high Column grace, Ascending to the Summit from the Base. Be first his swift and glorious Course exprest, When he from Belgia's Regions to the East Transfer'd the hardy War, did bold advance To whelm the Danube o'er the Pride of France. Thro' distant Empires to extend the Fame, Of Albion's Arms, and Anna's awful Name: The Wonders done at Schelenburg display, And the great Deeds of Blenheim's glorious Day Down all the Ebb of Time to Men unborn convey. Next shew the Hero on Ramilla's Plain, And deathless Laurels won that great Campaign: The Valour shown at Oudenard repeat, The Briton's Triumphs and the Gaul's Defeat. Describe the Conduct and the hardy Toil, That wrested from the Foe his darling Lisle, In passing Scalda's Flood th' acquir'd Renown, Brussella sav'd, and Ganda's vanquish'd Town. The Angles of the Pedestal you'll grace With Figures proper to adorn each Place; Chuse of the following, which shall please you best, If by the Loom all cannot be exprest. Chain'd Tyranny expose, delineate well The odious Features of that Fiend of Hell. When you this Figure horrible design, All Lybia's Plagues, and Scythia's Terrors joyn. Give to her Eyes a red malignant Glare, And let the Monster's threefold Head, for Hair Black Curls of pois'nous, hissing Vipers wear, Which full of Rage their crested Necks erect, And forked Deaths with cloven Tongues eject: Give her the surest Weapons to destroy Which savage Beasts and rav'ning Birds employ; The Dragon's Teeth, the Alligator's Jaws, The Eagle's Pounces, and the Lion's Paws. Distend her hideous Belly with a Load Of Limbs devour'd, and Seas of guiltless Blood. The Poets, who in Arms their Pallas drest, Had in their Fiction greater Art exprest, If in her fatal Shield they had display'd Fierce Tyranny's, and not the Gorgon's Head. On the next Corner with ingenious Pains Show vanquish'd Envy bound with brazen Chains: Let her Lean Face Infernal Features wear, A spleenful Aspect and a scornful Air; With its last Dregs let a dark Jaundice taint Her hateful Skin and loathsome Visage paint. Make her fierce Eyes, like livid Flames of Hell, Burn bloodshot in their Urns, and backward dwell Deep in their Caves, like Furies in their Cell. Let her with endless self-tormenting Care, Gnaw her own Heart, and her own Bowels tear. Shew how her Jaws her meagre Limbs devour; Green Floods of Hemlock Gaul and Wormwood pour Down her wide Throat, to poison every Vein, Inflame her Bosom, and distract her Brain. Shew with what Rage the Captive Fury views The spreading Laurels on the Victor's Brows, While she as pale and hideous as Despair, Gnashes her Teeth, and grasps her snaky Hair. Next on the Base Dissimulation bind A mild and courteous, but an odious Fiend; Who labours most to win us to believe Her Oaths unfeign'd, when most she would deceive. Give her an honest Mien, an Aspect free From Affectation and Hypocrisy; Well imitated Truth, and Eyes sincere Oft dropping, when she vows, a faithless Tear. Express her artful Smiles, that hide the Art, And friendly Manners, that ensnare the Heart. In her Right Hand a Monarch's Sceptre place, And her long Robe of State with Lillies grace Torn Treaties interweave, and solemn Leagues Broke or eluded by refin'd Intreagues. Express Ambition next in Fetters bound, Sunk from her Height, and grov'ling on the Ground Let thwarted Pride sit sullen on her Brow, And Indignation in her Eye-balls glow. Let anxious Looks her inward Care attest, And prove that deep Designs employ her Breast; That warring Passions strive within for vent, Cruel Revenge and haughty Discontent; Passions, that still the Fury wakeful keep, Fierce as the Winds, and restless as the Deep. In some sit Place let pleas'd Spectators see The proud Remains of ruin'd Dignity, Rich Purple Robes polluted, broken Crowns, Fragments of Scepters, and subverted Thrones, Sad Wrecks of Pow'r, which on th' Aspiring wait In troubled Empires and in Storms of State: Her adverse Fate reluctant let her bear, Her Fetters spurn, her Limbs in Anguish tear, And rave to find her Pomp and Pride depress'd, Her Foes exalted, and her Friends distress'd, While she compell'd must Spoils immense restore, Acquir'd by Fraud, or grasp'd by greedy Pow'r, Contract her Frontier, all her Slaves release, And beg the Conqu'ror to prescribe a Peace. A SATYRE UPON WIT. Printed in the Year 1700. Who can forbear, and tamely silent sit, And see his native Land undone by Wit? Boast not, Britannia, of thy happy Peace, What if Campaigns and Sea Engagements cease, Wit, a worse Plague, does mightily encrease: Some monstrous Crimes to Ages past unknown, Must sure have pull'd this heavy Judgment down; Whence Insect-Wits draw out their noisy Swarms, And threaten Ruin more than foreign Arms: O'er all the Land the hungry Locusts spread, Gnaw every Plant, taint every flow'ry Bed, And crop each budding Vertue's tender Head. How happy were the old unpolish'd Times, As free from Wit as other modern Crimes; As our Forefathers vig'rous were, and brave, So they were vertuous, wise, discreet and grave, And did alike detest the Wit and Knave. For Wits and Fools they justly thought the same, And Jester was for both the common Name. Their Minds for Empire form'd, did long retain Their noble Roughness, and soft Arts disdain; For Business born, and bred to martial Toil, They rais'd the Glory of Britannia's Isle, Which then her dreadful Ensigns did advance, To curb Iberia, and to conquer France. But this degenerate, loose and foolish Race Are sunk to Wits, and their great Stock debase: Learning and Sense decay, while Jest is grown The Conversation of the laughing Town, Where manly Virtues, which we once could boast, Unnerv'd by Mirth and Levity, are lost. So far this Plague prevails, I fear, in vain We now attempt its Progress to restrain; It takes Men in the Head, and in the Fit They loose their Senses, and are gone in Wit: By various Ways their Frenzy they express, Some with vile Lines run haring to the Press, In Leudness some are Wits, and some in Dress. Some seiz'd, like Graver, with Convulsions strain Always to say fine Things, but strive in vain, Urg'd with a dry Tenesmus of the Brain. Had but the People, scar'd with Danger, run To shut up Will's, where this sore Plague begun, Had they the first infected Men convey'd Straight to Moorfields, the Pest-House for the Head, The wild Contagion might have been supprest, Some few had fall'n, but we had sav'd the rest, An Act like this had been a good Defence Against our great Mortality of Sense; But now the Poison spreads, the Bills run high, At the last Gasp of Sense Ten Thousand lie. We meet fine Youth in every House and Street, With all the mortal Tokens out of Wit. Vannine, that look'd on all the Danger past, Because he 'scap'd so long, is seiz'd at last; By Pox, and Hunger, and by D?n bit, He Grins and Snarls, and in his dogged Fit Froths at the Mouth, a certain Sign of Wit. Craper runs madly 'midst the sickest Crowd, And fain would be infected if he could; Under the Means he lies, frequents the Stage, Is very Leud, and do's at Learning rage; Yet happily his Care and Pains are lost, By his Athletick Constitution crost: Against th' Assaults of Wit his Make is Proof, Still his strong Nature works the Poison off; He still escapes, but yet is wond'rous pleas'd Jests to recite, and to be thought diseas'd. So Hypocrites in Sin, in this vile Town, Boastful pretend to Vices not their own. Since this vain Humour has the Realm possest, And sober Heads are grown a standing Jest; Men arm'd with Pow'r should this light Spirit hate, That saps the Church, and undermines the State. What Throne is safe, what Government can last, When impious Wits have laid all Vertue waste? While Wisdom fails, and Probity decays, In vain we beat our Heads for Means and Ways. The laughing Mob is up, and range the Town, With Jests and Noise they bear all Reason down; Subvert Divine Religion's envy'd Fence, Set up loose Wit, and pull down common Sense. Our Libraries they gut, and shouting bear The Spoils of ruin'd Churches in the Air. Their Captain Tom do's at their Head appear, And S?d in his Gown brings up the Rear. Aloud the Church and Clergy they condemn, Curse all their Order, and their God blaspheme. Against all Springs of Learning they declare, Against Religion's Nurseries, and swear They'll of the Schools not One Supporter spare. But chief the Crew affirm by all that's good, They'll ne'er disperse till they have B?ly's Blood For that ill-natur'd Critick has undone The finest Piece of Wit, that has been shown: Till his rude Strokes had thresh'd the empty Sheaf We thought there had been something else than Chaff: Crown'd with Applause this Master-Critick sits, And round him lie the Spoils of ruin'd Wits: How great a Man! what Rev'rence were his due, Could he suppress the Critick's Fastus too? As certain Words will Lunaticks enrage, Who did before appear sedate and sage, So do but Lock, or Books, or Newton name, The Wit's in clammy Sweats, or in a Flame. Horror and Shame! what would the Madmen have? They dig up learned Bernard's peaceful Grave; The sacred Urn of the fam'd Stilling fleet, We see prophan'd by the leud Sons of Wit. The skillful Ty?n's Name they dare invade, And yet they are undone without his Aid; Learning they next to Vertue most abhor, Laugh at Discretion, but at Business more: For a loose Wit's an Idle Fool of Parts, That hates all Liberal and Mechanick Arts. Mirth do's enfeeble and debauch the Mind, Before to Action or to Arts inclin'd. How mean a Trifler is a saunt'ring Wit, Only to please with Jests at Dinner fit? What hopeful Youths for Bar and Bench design'd, Seduc'd by this light Vein have Cooke declin'd? For what has Wit to do with Sense or Law? Can that in Titles find or mend a Flaw? Can that supply great T?by's nervous Sense, Or S?r's more than Roman Eloquence? The Law will ne'er support this jesting Breed, There Blockheads may, but Wits can ne'er succeed. Thy Learning G?ns, and thy Judgment H?w Make you in envy'd Reputation grow: Had you been Wits, you had been both secure From Business, and for Satyre too obscure, Ill-natur'd, arrogant and very poor, Let Malice rage, the Thousands whom you raise From threaten'd Death, will bless you all their Days, And spend the Breath you sav'd in just and lasting Praise. Had not this merry Sickness of the Head, This Plague in Fashion o'er the Nation spread, Proud of her Sons, Britannia might have seen Vast Numbers more of great and generous Men. She had not lost a Senator in M?l, Nor a fine Scholar in the hopeful B?l: Now, since his foolish Rhymes, both Friends and Foes Conclude they know, who did not write his Prose. Wit do's our Schools and Colleges invade, And has of Letters vast Destruction made; Has laid the Muses choicest Gardens waste, Broke their Inclosures, and their Groves defac'd. We strive in Jests each other to exceed, And shall e'er long forget to write or read. Unless a Fund were settled once, that could Make our deficient Sense and Learning good, All Hope will be extinguish'd; for the Debt By this loose Age contracted is so great, To set the Muses Mortgag'd Acres free, Our Bankrupt Sons must sell outright the Fee. The present Age has all their Treasure spent, They can't the Int'rest pay at Five per Cent. Ye noble Patrons, who Parnassus sway, Whom all the Muses tuneful Sons obey, Are in your Service and receive your pay, Exert your Soveraign Pow'r, in Judgment sit To regulate the Nation's Grievance, Wit; Pity the cheated Folks, that ev'ry Day For Copper Jests good Sterling Silver pay: If once the Muses Chequer would deny To take false Wit, 'twould lose its Currency; Not a base Piece would pass, that pass'd before, Just wash'd with Sense, or thinly plated o'er. Set forth your Edict, let it be enjoyn'd, That all defective Species be recoyn'd: R?r and E?r?t are Judges fit To oversee the Stamping of our Wit. Let these be made the Masters of Essay, For they will every Piece of Metal weigh, And tell which is too light, or has too much Allay. 'Tis true, that when the coarse and worthless Dross Is purg'd away, there will be mighty Loss. Ev'n C?e, S?n, manly W?ly, When thus refin'd, will grievous Suff'rers be. Into the Melting-Pot, when D?n comes, What horrid Stench will rise, what noisome Fumes? How will he shrink, when all his leud Allay And wicked Mixture shall be purg'd away? The Men who D?s melt, and think to find A goodly Mass of Bullion left behind, Copy the Hibernian Wit, who, as 'tis told, Burnt his gilt Leather to collect the Gold. But when our Wit's call'd in, what will remain The Muses learned Commerce to maintain? How pensive will our Beaus and Ladies sit? They'll mutiny for want of ready Wit. That such a Failure no Man may incense, Let us erect a Bank of Sterling Sense; A Bank, whose current Bills may Payment make, Till new-mill'd Wit shall from the Mint come back. Let S?er, D?set, Sh?ld, M?gue, Lend their great Names, the Project then will do. The Bank is fix'd, if these will underwrite, Who pay the vastest Sums of Wit at Sight. These are good Men, in whom we all agree, Their Notes for Wit are good Security; Duncombs and Claytons in Parnassus all, Who cannot sink, unless the Hill should fall. Their Bills, tho' ne'er supported by Trustees, Will thro' Parnassus, circulate with Ease: If these come in, the Bank will quickly fill, All will be scrambling up Parnassus Hill; They'll crowd the Muses Hall, and throng to write Great Sums of Wit, and will be Gainers by't. V?e and C?e both are wealthy, they Have Funds of Standard Sense, need no Allay, And yet mix'd Metal oft they pass away. The Bank may safely their Subscriptions take, But let 'em for their Reputation Sake, Take care their Payments they in Sterling make. Codron will underwrite his Indian Wit, Far fetch'd indeed, so 'twill the Ladies fit: By hearsay he's a Scholar, and they say The Man's a sort of Wit too in his Way. Let 'em receive whatever P?r brings, In Lyrick Strains no finer Genius sings; 'Tis Complaisance when to divert his Friends He to facetious Fancies condescends. T?e will subscribe, but set no Payment-Day; For his slow Muse you must with Patience stay, He's honest, and as Wit comes in will pay. The Bank, when thus establish'd, will supply Small Places for the little loit'ring Fry, That follow G?, or at Will Ur?'s ply. Their Station will be low, but ne'er the less For this Provision they should Thanks express, 'Tis sad to be a Wit and Dinnerless. T?n the great Wit-Jobber of the Age, And all the Muses Brokers will engage Their several Friends to cry the Actions up, And all the railing Mouths of Envy stop. Ye Lords, who o'er the Muses Realm preside, Their Interests manage, and their Empire guide; Regard your Care, regard the Sacred State, Laid by Invaders waste and desolate. Tartars, and Schythians, have in barb'rous Bands Rifled the Muses, and o'er-run their Lands. The Native Subjects, who in Peace enjoy'd The happy Seat, are by the Foe destroy'd. Gardens and Groves, Parnassus did adorn, Condemn'd to Thistles now, and curst with Thorn; Instead of Flowers and Herbs of wholesome Use, The Beds rank Weeds and pois'nous Plants produce, Fitter to be for Witches a Retreat, Owls, Satyres, Monkeys, than the Muses Seat; Who since debauch'd by D?n and his Crew, Turn Bawds to Vice, and wicked Aims pursue. Therefore some fit and wholesome Laws ordain, That may this wild licentious Course restrain; To Vertue and to Merit have regard, To Punish learn, you know how to Reward. Let those Correction have and not Applause, That Heav'n affront, and ridicule its Laws. No sober Judge will Atheism e'er permit To pass for Sense, or Blasphemy for Wit. Declare that what's Obscene shall give Offence; Let Want of Decency be Want of Sense. Send out your Guards to scow'r the Ways, and seize The Footpads, Outlaws, Rogues and Rapparees, That in the Muses Country rob and kill, And make Parnassus worse than Shooter's Hill. The strictest Justice should on these be shown, Or Schools of Learning soon must be undone. For now a vertuous Pen scarce peeps Abroad, And all chaste Muses dread the dangerous Road. If in Parnassus any needy Wit, Should filch and petty Larceny commit; If he should rifle Books, and Pilferer turn, An Inch beside the Nose the Felon burn; Let him distinguish'd by this Mark appear, And in his Cheek a plain Signetur wear. Chastise the Poets, who our Laws invade, And hold with France for Wit an Owling Trade: Felonious G? pursuing this Design, Smuggles French Wit, as Merchants Silks and Wine; But let his Suff'rings doubly be severe, For he both steals it there, and runs it here. Condemn all those, who 'gainst the Muses Laws, Solicite Votes and canvass for Applause. When Torman writes, he rattles up and down, And makes what Friends he can, to make the Town. By Noise and Violence they force a Name, For this leud Town has Setters too for Fame. It is not Merit now, that recommends, But he acquires most Fame, that makes most Friends. In Panegyrick let it be a Rule, That for his Sense, none praise a wealthy Fool. D?n condemn, who taught Men how to make Of Dunces Wits, an Angel of a Rake. By Treats and Gifts, our Youth may now commence, Wits without Brains, and Scholars without Sense. They cry up Darfel for his Parts; to treat Let Darfel cease, and they their Words will eat. Great Atticus himself these Men would curse, Should Atticus appear without his Purse. Of any Price you may bespeak a Name, For Characters they cut, and Retail Fame; Bounty's the Measure of a Patron's Mind, For they have still most Brains, that prove most kind. Fame on great Men's a Charge, that still goes on; For Wits, like Scriv'ners, take for Pro and Con. Without his Gold, Pausanias had not writ With Spartan Judgment, and Athenian Wit. Those, who by Satyre would reform the Town, Should have some little Merit of their own, And not be Rakes themselves below Lampoon. For all their Libels Panegyricks are, They're still read backward, like a Witch's Pray'r. Ell?t's Reproofs, who do's not make his Sport? Who'll e'er repent that S?d do's exhort? Therefore let Satyre Writers be supprest, Or be reform'd by cautious D?set's Test. 'Tis only D?set's Judgment can command Wit, the worst Weapon in a Madman's Hand. The biting Things by that great Master said, Flow from rich Sense, but theirs from want of Bread, To lash our Faults and Follies is his Aim, Theirs is true Worth and Vertue to defame: In D?set Wit (and therefore still 'twill please) Is Constitution, but in them Disease. Care should be taken of the Impotent, That in your Service have their Vigour spent. They should have Pensions from the Muses State Too old to write, too feeble to translate. But let the lusty Beggar-Wits, that lurk About the Hill, be seiz'd and set to work. Besides some Youths Debauches will commit, And surfeit by their undigested Wit: Th' intoxicating Draught they cannot bear, Their Heads grow giddy e'er they are aware; Weak Brothers, by Excesses it appears, Have oft been laid up Months, and some whole Years That neither Sick nor Poor you may neglect, For all the Muses Invalids, erect An Hospital upon Parnassus Hill, And settle Doctors there, of Worth and Skill. This Town can Numbers for your Service spare. That live obscure, and of Success despair: Fracar has many sow'r Invectives said, And Jests upon his own Profession spread, And with good Reason, 'twill not find him Bread. And some such Doctors sure you may perswade To labour at th' Apothecary's Trade; They'll make up Medicines, at the Mortar sweat, And out of pounded Drugs their Dinner beat. THE KIT-CATS. A POEM. Printed in the Year 1708. TantÃ¦ molis erat? Advertisement. This Poem was writ some Years ago, as the Reader will perceive, and not design'd for the Press. But the Author having unwarily let a Copy of it go out of his Hands, which he has not been able to recover, has at length thought fit to make it publick, having Reason to believe it will otherwise come Abroad, by Means of the Copy before-mention'd. I sing th' Assembly's Rise, Encrease and Fame, That condescends to honour Kit-Cats Name, Whose Pride, like thine, O Rome, from small Beginnings came. Oh, Thou, who Chief art to the Muses dear, Whom Poets court, and Statesmen love or fear; Who with an uncontroul'd despotick Sway, Do'st still new Burdens on thy Subjects lay; That tax'd by Thee, with less Reluctance bear The Charge of CÃ¦sar's, than of Anna's War, And reeking in thy own and Roman Sweat Dost ancient Conquests o'er the French Repeat; Do Thou, great Bocai, smooth thy spacious Brow, And one kind Smile on my Attempt bestow. For Thou, whose fertile Genius do's abound With noble Projects, did'st this Order found, And still do'st cherish, cultivate and guide Thy humble Creature, and with decent Pride Do'st, like the God of Wine, the Kit-Cat State bestride. Gracious appear, as when thou mount'st thy Seat High in the great Assembly to create Some Peer a Member of the Kit-Cat State. Or when, Apollo like, thou'rt pleas'd to lead Thy Sons to Feast on Hampstead's airy Head; Hampstead, that tow'ring in superior Sky Now with Parnassus do's in Honour vie. When warlike William, Albion's Scepter sway'd, Succour'd th' Opprest, th' Oppressor's Progress staid, And of Europa's Peace the blest Foundations laid, Illustrious Deeds were still the Hero's Aim, He follow'd Danger, as he flew from Fame; A Thousand Ills he bore in Albion's Cause, Patient of every Suff'ring, but Applause. Reverse of Lewis, he (Example rare!) Lov'd to deserve the Praise, he could not bear; He shun'd the Acclamations of the Throng, And always coldly heard the Poet's Song. Hence the great King the Muses did neglect, And the meer Poet met with small Respect. But tho' the Muses and their tuneful Train, In this fam'd Monarch's Military Reign, Had of the Royal Favour little Share, Still they were kinder Bocai's tender Care. He still caress'd the unregarded Tribe, And did to all their various Tasks prescribe; From whence to Both great Acquisitions came, To him the Profit, and to them the Fame. On the fair Strand, by which with graceful Pride Unrival'd Thames rolls his alternate Tide. Between the Courts, which most the People awe (In One the Monarch reigns, in One the Law) A stately Building reer'd its lofty Head, Which both the Thames and Town around survey'd; Here crown'd with Clusters, Bacchus kept his Court, Where mighty Vats his chearful Throne support; High o'er the Gate he hung his waving Sign, A Fountain red with ever-flowing Wine. Here Politicians use to recreate Their Lungs exhausted with their long Debate In sett'ling or perplexing Points of State. In Pleasure here they pass the waning Night, And the hard Labours of the Day recite: They tell how bravely Artop Silence broke, And how much like an Angel Oran spoke. How some Young Orators new come from School Mounted the Rope, and danc'd without a Pole: What wretched Speeches t'other Party made, How weak and how insipid Things were said By all their Leading Men; but by their own What Miracles of Eloquence were shown, What Flames of Fire, what Thunderbolts were thrown. How all their Speakers but of middle Name, Surpass'd the Grecian and the Roman Fame. They tell with how much Negligence of Art, With how sincere an Air and open Heart, The prudent Prolocutor plaid his Part. Th' elated Victors of their Conquest boast, And triumph at the vanquish'd Party's Cost, And tell how down they look'd, the Question lost. One Night in Sev'n, at this convenient Seat, Indulgent Bocai did the Muses treat, Their Drink was gen'rous Wine, and Kit-Cat's Pies their Meat. Here he assembled his Poetick Tribe, Past Labours to reward, and new prescribe: Hence did the Assembly's Title first arise, And Kit-Cat Wits sprung first from Kit-Cat's Pies. Bocai, the mighty Founder of the State, Led by his Wisdom, or his happy Fate, Chose proper Pillars to support its Weight. All the first Members for their Place were fit, Tho' not of Title, Men of Sense and Wit: While Kit-Cats by their Discipline secure Preserv'd their well-fram'd Constitution pure, Soon from this warm well-cultivated Bed, Letters came forward, Sense began to spread, And Wit shot up apace its thriving Head. The languid Muses now new Life acquire, And every Genius feels its Native Fire: The cheerful Bards their weekly Works rehearse, And noble Subjects sing in noble Verse. No sweeter Lays, nor more exalted Strains E'er blest Parnassus, or th' Arcadian Plains; The tuneful Tribe with Praise each other crown, And Bocai with a Nod approves Apollo's Son. Old Thames, while list'ning to the Poet's Song, In ling'ring Volumes slowly crept along; But soon the Flood, that with Reluctance past, To hear the charming Lays return'd in haste. Their Conversation fed their mutual Fame, And made the Bards at Flights much higher Aim: For Men of Wit, do Men of Wit inspire, And Emulation strikes out nobler Fire. Mean Time, these Sons of Wit advanc'd their Name, And fair Augusta rang with Kit-Cat Fame. Their brighter Beams eclips'd the fading Toast, That long before unrivall'd rul'd the Roast. Now Crowds to Founder Bocai did resort, And for his Favour humbly made their Court. The little Wits attended at his Gate, And Men of Title did his Levee wait; For he, as Soveraign by Prerogative, Old Members did exclude, and new receive. He judg'd who most were for the Order fit, And Chapters held to make new Knights of Wit. While Kit-Cats thus to their first Maxims true, Not of high Station, and in Number few, Did Wit's just Rights and Interests pursue, They were by All esteem'd, by All carest, The Town's Delight, the Life of ev'ry Feast; If not a Kit-Cat Wit or Two were there, Flat was the Wine, and tastless was the Cheer; To such a Height so soon their Credit rose, And such great Men their Order did compose; But who can flourish long and raise no envious Foes? As when new States industrious, frugal, wise, Advancing swift to Strength and Wealth arise, The Realms around are jealous of their Pow'r, Suspect and fear those they despis'd before: Great Potentates each other's Court alarm, And to suppress the growing Neighbour arm. So here the Foes of Wit soon Umbrage took, And did with Envy on the Kit-Cat look. The numerous Species of the Blockhead Race, Which the Long Robe, Camp, Gown and Court disgrace, With all the vast Variety of Fools Of Mother-Nonsence, or improv'd in Schools, The Noisy and Impertinent, and all The Fops and Pedants, all the whimsical, Half-craz'd, half-witted, of the R?ff Kind, Against the rising Kit-Cat State combin'd. O, Bocai! all these mighty Clans rebell'd Against thy Throne, by Sense and Wit upheld. Their envious Tongues thy Government defam'd, And loud against thy spreading Fame exclaim'd. For they assert the Privilege to play The Fool or Madman in their proper Way; These Sons of Liberty will ne'er endure The Tyranny of Sense, or Vertue's Foreign Pow'r. But they in vain the Kit-Cat State assail'd, Their ill-laid Plots and bung'ling Malice fail'd. Fix'd on a Rock, great Bocai's Throne withstood Confed'rate Fops, and Folly's confluent Flood. Resisted thus, his Reputation rose; For all wise Men esteem, what Fools oppose: Their Leaders raving, that from each Attack With mighty Loss their Troops were beaten back, Resolv'd in Council on a wise Design, What all their Force repell'd to undermine. In fam'd Hibernia on the Northern Main, Where Wit's unknown, and Schools are built in vain, Between Two Hills, that rise with equal Pride, And with their Tops the floating Clouds divide, A lazy Lake, as Lothe black and deep, Secure from Storms, extended lies asleep. Young vig'rous Winds, which heavy Tempests bear, With fruitless Toil shove at the stagnant Air; Their Breath all spent, they from their Labour cease, And leave th' unweildy Fogs to rest in Peace. The Beasts, that come for Water, at the Brink Benumb'd, stand Nodding and forget to drink: The Birds by luckless Fortune hither brought, Fall down, and sleeping on the Water, float: The thoughtless Boat-Men scarcely half awake, Do never one successful Voyage make, But yawn, and drop their Oars into the Lake. These Shores, that with this quiet Breed abound, Kindly supply the Neighb'ring Nations round With calm Commanders, who enjoy their Ease, And rule in Time of War a harmless Fleet in Peace. On the dark Margin of the stagnant Flood, The Temple of the God of Dullness stood, With rude Magnificence sublime in Air, Thick Walls of Mud the pond'rous Roof did bear. Of Birds the formal Owl, of Beasts the Ass, Dear to the God, did the dark Niches grace; And on the Dome's high Front, ill cut in Wood, Sottish Silenus and dull Morpheus stood. Irregular it seem'd in every Part, Which, as in China, here is perfect Art. In gouty Pillars, thick unlightsome Walls, With Windows at the Top, like Pidgeon-Holes, It imitates our hideous Church of Paul's. Such is the Skill, that all the Parts appear Contriv'd for cold and blind Devotion here. Sleek pamper'd Priests beneath the Altar snore, And stretch'd at Ease, their stupid God adore. The Vot'ries here eternal Silence keep, And unreproach'd their Worship pay asleep. The Idol is compos'd of Massy Lead, And Wreaths of Poppy-Flowers adorn his Head: Lolling and Yawning in his Chair of State, His Head reclin'd, the drouzy Figure sate. For Incense here, instead of Indian Gums, Kindled Nicotian spreads more grateful Fumes, Which lull the Senses vex'd with Care and Pain, Blunt the sharp Edge of Thought, and kindly cloud the Brain. Hither the various complicated Foes That all enrag'd against the Kit-Cats rose, Sworn Enemies to Bocai and to Wit, Sent Deputies for their Employment fit. The Coxcomb Clan Sir Thomas Trifle chose, Prince of the civil Fops and grey-hair'd Beaus: The grave and bookish Blockheads of our Isle Sent a fam'd Native of Hibernia's Soil, Dodwell, of undigested Fathers full, Opprest with Learning, and profoundly dull. The Vertuoso Tribe deputed S?, Who got the Poll from L?st?r but by One. The Mountebanks were first inclin'd to Read, But Twinkler nam'd, in Twinkler all agreed. The Politicians did their Mac?h send, Of all the Foes of Sense a faithful Friend; He with him took his Books, a pond'rous Load, Design'd an Off'ring to the sleepy God. The Pedant Tribe, who Wit and Sense oppose, And the false Criticks, Learning's mortal Foes, Ch?d, a wond'rous shining Genius, chose. Strong B?ks was chosen by the lower Gown, The scribling Rakes sent the poor Devil Brown, Who doom'd to starve, yet fated to believe He shall in eating Circumstances live, Do's with a Stomach empty as his Head, Write in a Garret to the Shops for Bread. The Lawyers, once of one Opinion, chose The great Aurato with a loud Applause. These by Aurato led, did soon proceed To the fam'd Temple with industrious Speed, When their grave Speaker slowly Silence broke, And thus the God of Dullness did invoke; But hem'd and paus'd, and on his Notes did pore. Repeating often what he said before. Great drousy Pow'r, whose wide extended Sway, All the cold Kingdoms of the North obey; Who gently rul'st the whole Hibernian Isle, And a large Part of Albion's Neighb'ring Soil, We in the Name of all thy Vot'ries there, Address thy Altars with our humble Pray'r; An upstart Sect, one Bocai at their Head, Have great Commotions in Britannia bred; Who would with Arts the British Youth refine, And the Subversion of thy Throne design. The Kingdom into Parties they have split, Rebels to Sense, and Schismaticks in Wit. In Strength the restless Sectaries encrease, And interrupt thy quiet Subjects Peace. Still with fresh Conquests they extend their Fame, And now at universal Empire aim. Those, who to Thee have firm Affection shown, And always labour'd to support thy Throne, Who ne'er suspected were of such as Sin, To speak in Favour of the Sect begin. T?r himself affects to be Discreet And wav'ring W?d inclines to be a Wit. Ev'n T? and D?y disaffected grow, And underhand are treating with the Foe. Ambiguous D? who to no Side adher'd, Strangely drawn in, has for the Sect declar'd. Lugo, whom still we did with Honour name, That Men of Brains despis'd, and laugh'd at Fame, Assumes judicious Airs, and in the Pit, Grows hot for Sense, and violent for Wit. Robell, who Schools and Colleges did mock, Solid, unchang'd and steady as a Rock, In these revolting Times begins to shake, And do's Discoveries of Infection make. Young Ollan, so well-principl'd, and free From the wild Notions of fine Company, Ah, much lamented Youth! is from us lost, The gravest Genius which our Cause could boast; Had he escap'd his late unhappy Stain, And not with Wit forc'd his reluctant Brain, I had enroll'd him my adopted Son, To him I had bequeath'd my awful Gown. C?s and S?l, and a Thousand more, For whom, as for my self, I would have swore, Who stood unshaken, now begin to start, Leave their old Friends, and take the Faction's Part. If thou, great Pow'r, do'st not with Speed apply To this Disease some Soveraign Remedy, Soon from thy Empire Albion will be won, By Bocai's Kit-Cat Squadrons over-run; Squadrons, for this great Undertaking fit, All clad in solid Sense and treble polish'd Wit. Proud Kit-Cats soon will Triumph at thy Cost, Nor wilt thou more of Britain's Vot'ries boast; A Revolution, which was never fear'd, Where thou hast been so lov'd and so rever'd. H?n no longer will thy Shrines adore, Nor will Tr?m e'er obey Thee more. Great B?k's Gownmen, who have still withstood All Light and Sense, and made their Party good, A num'rous Clan, will All thy Cause disown, Declare for Wit, and worship Bocai's Throne. A Thousand Politicians will desert Their ancient Side, and take the Rebels Partâ More had he saidâBut strove in vain to keep His Eyelids ope, then fell down fast asleep. This Pray'r disturb'd the drozy God's Repose, Who with Reluctance from his Seat arose: He stretcht awhile, and did half-waken'd stand Rubbing his heavy Eyelids with his Hand; But rous'd at length, he to Aurato came, And gave him this kind Answer in a Dream. Thou, who so well dost thy high Post adorn, For fair Britannia's and my Service born, Know, faithful Servant, I shall still protect My British Vot'ries from this hated Sect. The haughty Kit-Cats, who my Pow'r defy'd, Shall find me able to correct their Pride. Let not my Friends despond, for certain Fate Decrees the Ruin of the Kit-Cat State. Let Kit-Cats cease to boast, cease ye to fear, The Fall, O Bocai, of thy Throne is near. Infernal Pow'rs will send at my Request Faction from Hell, thy Empire to infest; She'll with the Poison of her vip'rous Brood Infect their Veins and agitate their Blood; Will with malignant Heat their Breasts inspire, And with their Breath blow up Sedition's Fire. Now angry Kit-Cats feel the Fury's Flame, Talk big and Bocai with Dishonour name. Against his Ministration they inveigh, His haughty Airs, and arbitrary Sway: They cry he sep'rate Int'rest carries on, Pretends their Profit, but designs his own. Such Defamation shall they spread Abroad, And with collected Scandal Bocai load, Till in the troubled State Things desperate grown, Outrageous Kit-Cats shall assault his Throne. Now by Defection universal, they Shall from their Court Rebellion's Flag display, And swear they will no more the Tyrant's Will obey. They'll then dethrone their Leader, and declare An Interregnum and a vacant Chair. This crowns my Wish, with Bocai sinks their State, Who else has Shoulders equal to its Weight? Bocai depos'd, the Sect with Faction rent, Embroil'd in Feuds, and sow'r with Discontent, Shall into various warring Parties split, Which bring the Downfal of Imperious Wit. This Doom attends the upstart Kit-Cat State, This shall be Wit's, this shall be Bocai's Fate. Go back in Peace, my faithful Vot'ries, go, Let high Augusta my Prediction know; Let all the Clans and Sects you represent, Rest in the Prospect of the great Event. CREMES. A SATYRE. Writ in the Manner of Horace. Written in the late Reign. Cremes, I guess you have at length embrac'd More just Opinions, and improv'd your Taste: That you are tir'd with Cries of Clam'rous Hounds, With tramp'ling growing Corn, and breaking Mounds, Weary of constant Chases and Pursuits, And living still a Jockey Life in Boots, Of breaking Limbs to keep your self in Health, And feeding Dogs and Cocks to save your Wealth That you are cloy'd with course ill-manag'd Cheer, And the brown Nectar of October Beer; And with your Reverend Dunce, who puffs and pants Waddles with Fat, and bursts with Ale and Nants; Who must in Jest against those Vices preach, Which his loose Manners do in earnest teach. From Noise and Nonsense you would fain retire, Leave the Brute Tenant, and the awkard Squire, Who in his House foments eternal Strife, With Pleasure stroaks his Dog, and kicks his Wife. You'd be no more a great Domestick Boy, Your Mother's Comfort, and your Sisters Joy: And therefore fly to Town to be refin'd, To make your Fortune, and to know Mankind; Cremes, your Scheme is wond'rous well design'd. I see your Mirth, but Raillery apart, Tell me the Method and successful Art, By which an humble Fortune One may raise; You know the Town, and all the Means and Ways. Then to be serious, with attentive Ear The Maxims, which must guide your Conduct, hear. From Prejudice you must deliver'd be, From all Restraints of Education free; And own that Vice and Vertue are the same, That their Distinction from gross Error came, And that their Nature's one, tho' not their Name. Misguided and ill-principled at first, If you would shine, shake off your pious Rust. In your Opinions should you be so odd, As freely to assert and fear a God, The Scoffing Party will become your Foes, Deride your Folly, and your Aims oppose. You a new Creed, to please them, must receive, Embrace Spinosa, or in Hobbs believe. Learn with Delight Religion to explode, As idle Cant, as Fancy, or as Fraud; As an ignoble, feeble Passion, fit For giddy Women, not for Men of Wit. You boldly must engage to make it clear, That Superstitious, melancholy Fear Did first make Gods, and then their Altars rear. That Priests and Statesmen did th' Advantage take, And carry'd on the Cheat for Empire's Sake. Perhaps with secret Fears you'll be possest, That the fierce Viper will corrode your Breast, And ill-presaging Thoughts disturb your Rest: But persevere, and you will easy grow, Custom will make, and Wine will keep you so. Our Wits, who labour to refine the Town With Riot, will embrace you as their own, And their new Convert with Applauses crown; From all misgiving Thoughts your Bosom clear, Sooth your Remorse, and laugh away your Fear. Reluctant Reason you'll in Fetters keep, And lay th' insulting Judge within asleep. You'll triumph o'er Religious Knaves with Ease, Mock future Life, and soon know where 'twill please. You're right put off of Hand, if this be done, Your Ground well taken, you will smoothly run. Then plunge your self in Company, be known To all th' Bards and Criticks of Renown, To all the intreaguing Creatures of the Town. To gain Acquaintance universal strive, And into all their Vices freely give. Thus you a Man in Fashion will commence, Prais'd for your Mirth, fine Company, and Sense. Be sure at Levees humbly to attend, Strowling from Lord to Lord the Morning spend, Affect distinguish'd Impudence, and own You practise all the Leudness of the Town, But all the Vertue, which you have, disown. These brighter Days excel dull Ages past, Our Men and Ladies have refin'd their Tast. Those lik'd a Head sagacious, cool, and clear; False Wits to Us, Buffoons, and Fops are dear, Do you at Honour and Distinction aim, Acquire in Vice an unexampled Name. To mend the Laws when Lawyers shall engage, And Players labour to reform the Stage, When Lines obscene the Ladies shall offend, And Poets, Poets shall with Zeal commend; Then Men of Merit, who Assistance need, By Vertue not obstructed, shall succeed. All Qualities have triumph'd in their Turn, Arts, great Augustus, did thy Age adorn; Thy Reign, O Charles, did Sense and Learning show, Wits flourish'd in thy Son's, and Jesters now. When first a Genius, great in Wit and Vice, Do's like some bright unvulgar Beauty rise; And to display a noble Bloom begins The Promise of mature illustrious Sins: From House to House he's carry'd up and down, To Statesmen, Gen'rals and great Lords made known; By every Club of mighty Fame approv'd, By all applauded, and by all belov'd; Pamper'd with Praise, and with high Flatt'ry fed, Till oft the too strong Diet turns his Head. In peaceful Seas he do's with Pleasure ride, And runs before the Breeze, and with the Tide: Nor ever wants a favourable Gale, The Breath of all the Town extends his Sail. Vertue mean Time to stormy Seas confin'd, Has Shelves and Sands on either Side, behind The threat'ning Rocks, and in her Face the Wind. Pleas'd Neighbours crowd to see her in Distress, As Sussex Parsons, and their People press, When the loud Tempest rages on the Coast, With barb'rous Joy to see the Merchant tost; Then Eyes uplifted piously implore The Aid of Heav'n, to send the Wreck a-shore. Be well with all the Laughers, else in vain You strive a handsome Figure to sustain. Admire their Sense, call that vain Thing discreet, This Fool a Statesman, that Buffoon a Wit. Your Parts they'll in their Turn with Honour name, Promote your Int'rest, and protect your Fame. In their own Way the Men and Ladies please, Drink Burgundy with Those, and Tea with These On all the past and present Fops refine, Make your affected Indiscretion shine. For all the craz'd, the whimsical, the vain, And bright conspicuous Coxcombs now obtain. Some Strains of Folly next to Madness shew, Attempt some Strokes of Leudness bold and new. Or else invent some unexampled Thing, And careless tell it to the laughing Ring. Thus you will rise to Fame, you'll be a Wit, For high and finer Conversation fit, Ridiculous with Praise, and wisely Indiscreet. Learn all Intreagues, but chiefly Love-Affairs, Find out the Scandal of the private Stairs. Cringe to the Great, and in a fawning Way To every Creature Things obliging say, But most to those you scorn or would betray. Mark how the Lady's Inclinations tend, And by the Mistress, make the Lord your Friend. Write wretched Farce, be stupidly prophane, And please the Audience with a wanton Scene. Compose bad Plays, or good Ones ill translate, Your Friends are stanch, you need not fear your Fate. Grow a HeâGossip, do like F?r, Pick Scandal up, record the Tales you hear, And up and down the wise Tea-Tattle bear. Would you become the Darling of the Town, Be well with All the Ladies, but your own. Now make your Choice, pretend to what you please, Cry'd up by All, you must succeed with Ease. You may a Builder, or a Poet be, By Physick you may rise, or Heraldry. Your Patrons for you from th' unwilling Court, Which oft oblige those, who have Pow'r to hurt, Perhaps unfit Preferment may extort. Should you a Scholar prove and shine in Print, You may controul the Ord'nance or the Mint. You never saw the Sea, What then? By Land You may the Chart and Compass understand, And Chief's advise, how Navies to command. If you are pleas'd to leave your Native Soil, You may be sent to Rule some Western Isle; Your Excellence will that high Post become, Leave there bad Laws, and bring good Money Home. Or be Intendant of our Foreign Trade, By Four good Maps your Skill is perfect made. A Victualer, you may buy the Sailor's Food, Send them the Bad, and keep your self the Good. Another Way by which you cannot miss, The great Design at which you aim, is this: Turn Politician, Ministers arraign, And of imagin'd Grievances complain. In moving Accents, Britain's Fate display, Increase of Taxes, and of Trade Decay; Cry out the Wasters of Britannia's Coin, The Publick name, but Private Good design; That they are Fat by our Consumption grown, And empty all our Veins to fill their own. On the first Courtiers let your Fury fall, Still let them feel your Sting, and tast your Gaul. Whate'er Misfortunes come by Land or Sea, With Ardour charge them on the Ministry, For not preventing what they could not see. Let them for casual Losses be arraign'd, Or by our Merchants or our Fleets sustain'd By Tempests torn, or adverse Winds detain'd. Rise by Degrees, a stronger Tone assume, Grow warm, make Heav'n and Earth together come. Excite your Courage, be in Language bold, Not H? like, correctly weak and cold. When at the Court, you for your Country rave, Call Heav'n to Witness, you would only save Old England's Rights, and would not be a Slave. That you in all this Charge may seem sincere, With Hands spread forth, and Eyes uplifted swear, That you unmov'd can all Assaults abide, That no high Post shall draw you from your Side, Much less that you will e'er a Place divide. Whether the Question be of War or Trade, Exclaim aloud the Church will be betay'd. Against her fierce pretended Foes declare, Show her not safe ev'n under Anna's Care. Phantastick Clouds and dreadful Figures form, Cry out against th' imaginary Storm. Make deep Designs, that ne'er were laid, appear, And paint that Danger, which you do not fear. Hold Sir, to what do's all this Counsel tend? This will obstruct, and not promote my End. Hearken, Young Man, and you'll your Error mend. Some Courts by Provocations are endear'd, Where you are so much valu'd, as you're fear'd. From Opposition you'll their Favour find, Incense them to comply, and vex them to be kind. Weak State-Directors with bold Speech invade; Make them uneasy, you'll be easy made. Our Friends, they cry, by Principle are so, Our Int'rest is to court and gain the Foe; Tho' every Age arraigns th' ungrateful Scheme, All practise in their Turn, what All condemn. Good Heav'ns! is this your celebrated Town? Are these your Ways to Riches and Renown? Can impious Maxims here such Credit gain? Bold by Success do's Vice unbridled reign? Do's its licentious Deluge rise so high, Pass all Entrenchments, all Restraints defy? Do great Offenders trembling Justice awe? Deride Church-Censures, and elude the Law? Are Parties form'd true Merit to disgrace, While Vertue hides her ignominious Face? Can you a Zeal to spread Prophaneness own? In Irreligion are you Bigots grown? Are Libertines caress'd with loud Applause? Cabals engag'd to sink Religion's Cause? Should such be arm'd with Pow'r, and who can tell How high the Antichristian Tide may swell? They would, O Rome, thy Violence exceed; Pull ev'ry Altar down, burn ev'ry Creed. Is such a Town for me a fit Abode, Who own Religion, and revere a God? Who have th' Immortal coming State in view, And more than this, who am a Christian too? From this contagious Seat I'll fly away, For Health I'd sooner in a Pest-House stay. In barren Desarts rather live, confin'd To Savage Creatures of less noxious Kind. I'd seek the lonesome Margin of the Main, Hide in the Rock, or range the Sandy Plain: I'd find some unfrequented River's Tide, Lodge in the Reeds, or in the Woods abide, The Forrest-Den I'd chuse, or Mountain-Cave, To be my Dwelling, and my Vertue save. TO COLON Why, Colon, this melodious Sound? Why this luxurious endless Feast? Can Bowls with gallick Nectar crown'd, And mellow Sychophants around Asswage the Torments of a guilty Breast? Still wilt thou grin in Play-House Pit, Or saunt'ring seek the Puppet-Booth, Can'st thou thy monst'rous Crimes forget? Can Shows, or Women, Wine or Wit, The raging Viper in thy Bosom sooth? Forbear, vain Man, this fruitless Art, Thy Conscience ne'er can be appeas'd; Thou always feel'st her poison'd Dart, Art merry with an aking Heart, And tho' for ever laughing, yet ne'er pleas'd. So when Tarantulas have bit, Poor Farmers in Calabrian Plains, They all their rural Labour quit, And pleas'd with Musick in their Fit, Sing, laugh and dance, while rack'd with raging Pains. THE STORY OF Don Carlos, PRINCE of SPAIN. Carlos, the mighty Second Philip's Heir, Who now did proud Castilia's Scepter bear, Illustrious with Heroick Vertue shone, And every Grace and bright Endowment known In high-descended Youth, of generous Mind, For Empire, Arms, and worthy Deeds design'd; Bright Life and Spirit breaking from his Eyes, Did please at once Spectators, and surprize; Who there could trace great Actions yet to come, Young Vict'ries smiling in their downy Plume, The Hero's op'ning Bud, and Laurels in their Bloom. So were his Features mingled, that the Bold And Warm were temper'd by the Mild and Cold, The Strong and Martial by the Soft control'd. Hence did his Aspect blended Passions move, Delightful Awe and reverential Love: Discreet and just, munificent and kind, Sincere and courteous, and of Sense refin'd, The Court's Esteem he did unrivall'd gain, And grew the Wonder and the Boast of Spain. The Gallick Princess, his contracted Bride, Her Neighbour's Envy, and her Nation's Pride, Possess'd all Charms and Graces, which conspire To form consummate Beauty, and inspire Regard and Love, whence she the Chief was own'd Of high-born Virgins, who Europa crown'd: Nor did her Mind shine less surprizing bright, Serene, sagacious, and acute of Sight; Of Thought extensive, Reason clear and strong, Rarely the Honour of an Age so young. Th' engaging Features of the Royal Maid By Fame, to Love indulgent, were convey'd On Wings assiduous to the Prince of Spain; He heard, and felt a sweet unpractis'd Pain Throb in his Heart, and beat in every Vein. Willing he entertain'd the gentle Dart, Approv'd the Pleasure, and enjoy'd the Smart. But when he earnest view'd her Form Divine, And charming Face, which did in Colours shine, Drawn by a Master-Hand in France carest, Ravish'd, immod'rate Pleasure he exprest, And form'd a warmer Image in his Breast. Nor did the Gallick Princess less admire Spain's Royal Youth, but felt a secret Fire Spread thro' her tender Breast, that glowing strove With the first Efforts of expanding Love; Which warm'd and in th' indulgent Bosom fed, Stretch'd out its Limbs, and full-grown Wings display'd. By constant Couriers now the Royal Pair Maintain'd fond Commerce with alternate Care, Which kept alive their languishing Desires, Supply'd new Fewel, and improv'd their Fires. Now the high Pontiff studious to constrain Alva the Leader of the Pow'rs of Spain, To leave Hesperia's Fields, where then he lay, And did encamp'd with proud Defiance stay Before high Rome, us'd various Arts and Toil, Lorrain with new Commotions to embroil: He work'd his Aims; soon Spain in Arms engag'd, And War in Belgia's Plains with Fury wag'd. Two bloody Fields were fought at Gallia's Cost, Whose Army by inglorious Combat lost All the brave Youth her warlike Land could boast. France thus disgrac'd, enfeebled and distrest, Panting for Breath and languishing for Rest, Submissive courted Peace, and prudent chose To gain at any Cost her Realm's Repose. A solemn Treaty follow'd to concert A grateful Scheme of Terms to either Part, Carlos, who rav'd by Turns, by Turns was sad, While Arms the Triumph of his Love forbad, Was joy'd as much, while Fame on sounding Wings The News of Peace to sooth his Passion brings. But, while the Treaty held, the Queen bereft Of Life, a Widow'd Bed to Philip left, Who bent on farther Nuptials humbly su'd, And by repeated Efforts earnest woo'd Th' Illustrious Queen, whose Vertues Albion blest, Till oft repuls'd, he Gallia's Court addrest To gain the Bride for Carlos' Arms design'd: The Gaul, 'tis true, more to the Heir inclin'd Than the Possessor of Iberia's Crown, Whose Tide of Life far spent ebb'd hasty down, But all Things balanc'd, France could not withstand, So much she wanted Peace, the King's Demand. While certain Fame did this sad News impart To the Young Prince, like Light'ning's pointed Dart, It pierc'd his Breast, and wounded deep his Heart. And tho' the Anguish watchful he supprest, Yet in Despight of Care his Looks confest Too oft suspected Marks of secret Pain, Which to conceal, his Reason strove in vain. Now did the Royal beauteous Bride advance In Pomp and Splendor from the Court of France, By easy Journeys to deceive the Toil, And reach the Frontier of Iberia's Soil, Where to receive her with becoming State, Deputed Lords of Spain assiduous wait. Obsequious Carlos at their Head attends The Stranger Queen, and the same Car ascends. And now with secret Rapture he beheld The heav'nly Charms, that her bright Fame excell'd; And while his Eyes did on her Beauty feast, He felt his Wound bleed fresh within his Breast, Nor would his swelling Passion be supprest. And while the Queen the Royal Lover view'd, Her tender Looks and gracious Manner shew'd, She would her Stars have more propitious own'd, Had they her Love and not Ambition crown'd. With various Converse they beguil'd the Hours, Till they arriv'd at high Madrita's Tow'rs, Where Philip pleas'd with his auspicious Fate, Receiv'd his Consort at the Palace Gate; Whose lovely Features, Bloom and winning Grace, Eclips'd the Beauties of the Spanish Race: Of the first Rank she shone a radiant Star, The Idol of the Lords, and Envy of the Fair. The Prince of Spain, his Court assiduous made, And still with Pleasure in her Presence staid. The more he saw the more he did admire, Till her bright Form possess'd his Soul entire. Nor did he strive his Passion to disguise, But the soft Accents of his melting Eyes, The Eloquence of Looks and Vocal Mien, Love's tender Diction, told it to the Queen; Which in her Breast did anxious Care create, Touch'd with the gen'rous Prince's rigid Fate, Whose Reason was too Young to rule a Flame, Which from a Spring approv'd by Vertue came, And own'd a just, tho' unsuccessful Aim. She view'd him like a Ship, its Rudder lost, On swelling Waves by Winds tempestuous tost, Despairing e'er to gain the wish'd-for Coast. Philip, Hispania's Greatness to assure, Augment her Wealth, and wider Sway procure, Ambitious grasp'd at fair Navarra's Soil, And hop'd without Expence or Martial Toil Ungenerous to surprize and seize the Prey, And on her Subject Neck clandestine lay Iberia's Yoke, which once she did obey. Studious by Ways unworthy to succeed In this Attempt inglorious, he decreed To send the Royal Captives from their Court Secret to some remote Iberian Fort; There the imprison'd Princes to detain, And seize their Kingdom by the Troops of Spain. Alva his General by the King's Command For this base Purpose form'd a chosen Band, Trusting the Conduct to a faithful Hand; Who, ready Alva's Orders to obey, Fell sick, and long in wasting Torment lay. He now convinc'd that Life would soon expire, Stung with Remorse and Fears of endless Fire, To Philip's Consort did the Plot impart, And hop'd her Care the Tempest would avert. Surpriz'd and wond'ring at the black Intent, She to Navarra's Queen the Secret sent, To whom in Royal Blood she was ally'd, And by the Sacred Bonds of Friendship ty'd: Thus taking Vent the deep Design was lost, By Heav'n, that guards the Guiltless, kindly crost Soon as Prince Carlos heard the heinous Deed Unworthy of a Monarch, was decreed, The Project he indignant did resent, And threats to give his generous Passion Vent, Against the King's Advisers oft exprest, Which should have slept conceal'd within his Breast. He said in Rage, Those who the Scheme design'd, His just Displeasure should unpardon'd find. Alva and Gomez, Fav'rites, One of whom Wag'd War Abroad, One rul'd the State at Home, Jealous the Prince, who Philip's Council blam'd, Against their Lives the menac'd Vengeance aim'd, Surely to disappoint th' impending Blow, Concerted Carlos' Power to overthrow. Besides, the brave Iberian Prince of late, Toucht with the Suff'rings of the Belgian State, Had own'd Compassion to their hapless Fate. Where pious Rome's August Tribunal stood By Arms erected, and upheld in Blood. This kindled in the Priests vindictive Rage, Whose wrathful Flames, no Time nor Arts asswage; Wisely did Alva and his Friend conspire To urge the Prelates, and improve their Fire, That by these Holy Mens confed'rate Aid, The gath'ring Storm might break on Carlos' Head. Fair Eboli, mean Time the envy'd Bride Of Gomez, and Iberia's matchless Pride, For Carlos' Life did Snares destructive frame, Who show'd Contempt of her discover'd Flame: Nor was she less against the Queen enrag'd, Whose Charms she thought the Prince's Heart engag'd. And hence from diff'rent Principles she joyn'd With the Two Lords, who Carlos' Fate design'd. Since no Incentives jealous Princes move, Like Rival Pow'rs in Empire and in Love, To fire the King the Two great Lords arraign, Of bold and trait'rous Aims the Prince of Spain; While Eboli attempts with subtile Art To sting with painful Jealousy his Heart. One Day the King thus to the Lords begun, Have you observ'd the Temper of my Son? To me, his cloudy Fore-head seems to wear Concern unusual, and a thoughtful Air, The Tokens of some anxious secret Care. Whate'er it be, his Trouble seems unfeign'd, His Mirth dissembled, and his Smiles constrain'd. The Monarch ceas'dâAnd Gomez thus reply'd, His Change of Temper cannot be deny'd. Perhaps the Suff'rings of the Belgick State Afflict his Soul, and inward Pain create, For oft he mourns that Nation's present Fate. He of your mod'rate Violence complains, As too severe your gentle Arms arraigns, And wishes oft kind Heav'n would give him Pow'r To ease their Troubles, and their Rights restore. 'Tis like the Passion of a gen'rous Mind, Not yet by prudent Rules of State refin'd, Too much to Belgia has his Heart inclin'd. He cannot sure foment Sedition's Fire, Much less at Empire can his Thoughts aspire. Nor can he Northern Heresy protect, Tho' some sagacious Heads his Faith suspect. Hither, 'tis true, the Belgian Lords resort, And from the Prince assiduous ask Support; While constant Couriers Commerce close maintain Between the Belgian and the Prince of Spain; Perhaps that thus the Prince they may engage In Ways your just Resentment to asswage, And win you thence your Army to recall, And let high Rome's oppos'd Tribunal fall. He ceas'dâThe Lords retir'd, and in their Stead, Fair Eboli for Audience did succeed. Who thus beganâLong watchful I have seen, So Philip bad, the Intercourse between The Spanish Prince and Spain's Illustrious Queen. Heav'n knows, To Heav'n as Witness I appeal, With strong Reluctance I at last reveal Th' ungrateful Truth I've labour'd to conceal. But due Obedience to your high Command, Without deep Guilt can Eboli withstand? Dejected Carlos, scarce to Life and Sense, While absent from the Queen, can make Pretence. The Cloud and settled Sadness, which he wears In those black Hours, if her bright Form appears, Are from his Brow dispell'd, as Shades of Night And hovering Mists are chas'd by rising Light. His ravish'd Eyes still on her Beauty gaze, Wanton he basks and revels in the Blaze: As to a Being of celestial Race He often kneels, and now his Arms embrace Her Feet in amorous Raptures, now he stands Imprinting ardent Kisses on her Hands. The Queen's indulgent Smiles his Flame approve, She meets his Glances, and confirms his Love. But here Surmise should not proceed too far, Nor will the King condemn the Royal Pair, And from Imprudence heinous Guilt infer. Your Bed, Illustrious Monarch, may remain Still undefil'd, and they without a Stain: Your Native Goodness will incline your Heart To spare uncautious Youth, and Wrath avert. She saidâThen parted from the jealous King, And in his Bosom left th' envenom'd Sting. He feels, like warring Winds, strong Passions fight In his vext Soul, that darken Reason's Light. The Storm, which furious on his Vitals reigns, Drives thro' his Breast, and rages thro' his Veins, O'erwhelms his Heart, and scornful of controul Embroils the Springs of Life, and works his inmost Soul, In these dark Clouds, like rip'ning Thunder, lay Livid Revenge prepar'd to break away, And its destructive Terrors to display. Thoughtful a while and silent Philip stood, Forming black Schemes, and meditating Blood; Then did the King, in these fierce Accents, vent The jealous Passion in his Bosom pent. Rivall'd at once in Love and Empire, where Prudent and generous Minds disdain to bear The least suspected Guilt! My Son rebel! My Queen abuse my Bed! Perdition, Hell! Then both must die: Carlos, thy Fate's decreed, Just Heav'n will sure applaud the Righteous Deed. Treason and Incest joyn'd! thy Life alone, For Crimes so black, so monst'rous, can atone. 'Tis true, thou art my Son; no, Carlos, no, Thou wert my Son, but art no longer so. Mercy be dumb, Compassion cease to weep, And Love, inglorious Coward Passion, sleep Benumb'd with strong Oblivion, while I wrest By Force the struggling Father from my Breast, And sink indulgent Nature in my Soul, Which would arrest my Arms, and sweet Revenge controul. 'Tis doneânow, Carlos, I my Eyes can cloy With thy Distress, and thy last Pangs enjoy. Pleas'd I can see thy Eye-balls roll in Death, And hear thy double Sighs exhaust thy Breath. He saidâAnd then to give his Scruples Ease, And his reluctant Conscience to appease, He to the pious Fathers secret goes, Who Rome's August Tribunal did compose, And ask'd their Sense; These holy Sons of Pride, A cruel Race of Bigots, thus reply'd. Since the Young Prince the Flandrian Rebel courts, Aspires to Empire, and besides supports Invented Doctrines by the Christian Creed And sacred Rome condemn'd, to make him bleed Must be a just and meritorious Deed. By this bright Vertue emulous you shine, Of the just Man, who at the Word Divine Without Regret did Isaac's Life resign. Thus too the King will imitate the Love And the blest Aims, which did th' Almighty move To let his only Coeternal Son A Victim die, his Justice to atone. Thus did the Reverend Sycophants combine To urge the King, and aid his fierce Design. Brave Carlos not convicted and unheard To a warm Bath, at Philip's Word prepar'd, To sooth his Lust of Blood, was now convey'd, Where by the Steel his Veins were open laid. Philip, who all Entreaties had deny'd Of Friends and Princes to his House ally'd, And unrelenting as the Parian Rock, Did Carlos' Pray'r and low Submission mock, To please unnatural Hate and vengeful Spleen, Sate, and attentive view'd the Tragick Scene. Long he beheld the Vital Fountains play, Which wasted Life, and spouting every Way, Did thro' the red'ning Bath their Streams convey. He heard his Sighs, his Throbs and short'ning Breath, While trickling Sweat presag'd approaching Death: Yet did not Pity nor paternal Love Touch his hard Nature, or his Bowels move. He then retiring left th' unfinish'd Deed, And thus insulting Carlos' Fate, he said, My own Physician thus I cure my Blood, And let the Noxious out to save the Good. The bleeding Prince, as the fierce King withdrew, Stedfast pursu'd his Steps while yet in view With earnest ghastly Looks, and which to paint All Fancies are too cold, all Words too faint. Then cry'dâFor yet his falt'ring Speech could flow, My Father, no, nor King, but Tyrant go; Go cruel Man, th' indelible Disgrace Of Spain, the Scourge and Blot of Humane Race. Tygers and Wolves, which tear the harmless Herd With Hunger pinch'd, still their own Offspring guard. But Philip riots with inhumane Joy In his own Blood, do's his own Flesh destroy, And with th' unnatural Feast his Hunger cloy. But since you've wrested from my longing Arms, But never from my Heart, the heav'nly Charms Of Spain's bright Queen with spotless Vertue crown'd, Belov'd by me, to me by Contract bound, Inflicting Death, Compassion you have shown; What's Life, when all that's dear in Life is gone? He ceas'dâand kiss'd the Image of the Queen, That in his Hand he held till then unseen, And by his destin'd Bride from France was sent, On which he fix'd his Eyes and look'd intent, Till by Degrees Death's overspreading Shade Involv'd his Eye-balls, and his Soul, that staid Hov'ring a while o'er Life's expiring Flame, At length forsook th' inhospitable Frame. Now did the raving Monarch, to asswage His jealous Pain, and sooth vindictive Rage, Decree his beauteous Queen's untimely Fate, Nor could her lovely Form, her pregnant State, And blooming Youth incline his Marble Heart, Change his black Purpose, and his Wrath avert. Than Alva's Consort none of all the Fair Did ranker Hate, or greater Envy bear To the bright Queen; she at the King's Command Brought the sure Poison with a willing Hand. The Queen constain'd drank down the deadly Juice, Which in her boiling Veins did soon produce Destructive Ferments and malignant Heats, From whose fierce Rage invaded Life retreats, In Agonies of Pain and horrid Throws She lay convuls'd, when to insult her Woes And mock her dying Pangs, the Monarch drest As Mourners in a black depending Vest, Enter'd the Room with melancholy Pace, And strong dissembled Sorrow in his Face. He tenderly embrac'd the dying Queen, And with affected Grief, Theatrick Mien, And woful Voice he bad a long Adieu, And then the Royal Hypocrite withdrew. Now while the fatal Draught her Heart assail'd And o'er the last Efforts of Life prevail'd, In slow deep Sobs she gasp'd away her Breath, Stretch'd out her beauteous Limbs, and lovely smil'd in Death. THE NATURE OF MAN. Printed in the Year 1711. A POEM. In Three BOOKS. Quid quÃ¦que ferat Regio, &amp; quid quÃ¦que recuset. Virg. THE NATURE OF MAN. BOOK I. The Argument. The Introduction. The Proposition. The Variety of Vegetables and Animals in various Climates. Great and wise Men not the Production of the Torrid Zone, and the Reason why. This Observation exemplify'd in the Regions of Africa, the Kingdoms and Islands of the East and West-Indies that lie beneath the Ecliptick Line. The cold Regions near the Poles no less hurtful to Humane Nature. Instances of the Stupidity of those Nations near the Arctick Circle: Their Strength of Body: Their long Life. The Advantages of the temperate Climates for Courage, Sense, Wit and Politeness. Those too Cold or too Hot, not more receptive of Religion than fertile of Sense. The various Kinds of Idolatry in those barbarous Countries. Superior Bards, the Pride of ancient Days, Tuneful have honour'd with immortal Lays The lowing Grazer, and the fleecy Flock; The Goat, that brouzes on the shrubby Rock, And generous Steed, that flying leaves behind The panting Storm, and mocks the lagging Wind, With Ears erect springs ardent to the War, Or, proud in Triumph, draws the Hero's Car; The feather'd Clans, that soar amidst the Clouds Sublime, or perching sing in shady Woods; And all the swift-finn'd Nations of the Floods: Ev'n Infects too they rais'd, which artful form. Their waxen Caves; and the Silk-Weaver Worm. Mean Time Heav'n's Viceroy, Man, whose wide Command Controuls the spacious Realms of Sea and Land, Is left unsung: Then, Muse, extend thy Wing For unattempted Flight, and Humane Nature sing. Tell, what distinguish'd Regions chief abound With Wit and Sense, what Soil is most renown'd For Strength athletic, what with Valour crown'd. What different Virtues, and as different Crimes Owe their Production to peculiar Climes. Tell, whence a worthy Race does long endure, And what Defects its Ruin will procure. In various Countries, we with Wonder find Birds, Beasts, and verdant Plants of various Kind: The Golden Orange-Grove, and spreading Vine Ask a hot Soil, a cold the Fir and Pine. The Amaranth and odoriferous Rose Abhor Arabia's Sands, and Scythia's Snows. Few Realms, like that of fertile Britain, breed The fair-horn'd Bullock, and the swift-heel Steed. Bright Humane Nature does no less demand An Air adapted, and peculiar Land. In vain you hope Illustrious Youth will shine Beneath th' Ãquator, or th' Ecliptick Line; Where Sun-burnt Nations, of a swarthy Skin, Are fully'd o'er with blacker Clouds within. Their Spirits suffer by too hot a Ray, And their dry Brain grows dark with too much Day. For while the Solar Orb, with Heat intense, Concocts their Gold, it dissipates their Sense: So much his Beam the Nerves of Moisture drains, So draws transpiring Vapours from the Veins Thro' gaping Pores, the Channels can't diffuse O'er the parcht Head, sufficient gentle Dews. Their Spirits burning with too fierce a Fire Unqualify'd by proper Flegme, acquire A Disposition so inept for Thought, Few just Perceptions in their Minds are wrought. The scorcht and pathless Desarts of the Brain, Want proper Caves and Cells to entertain A Crowd of airy Forms and long Ideal Train. Observe the Realms from Congo's Lands to those Which Ãthiopia'a Southern Seas inclose: The Inland Tracts, that various Kings obey, Which the white Mountains of the Moon survey; Where, fabulous Atlas, thy vast Shoulders rise, And constant Winter wear in Summer Skies: Where Niger, wanton with his Silver Pride, Rolls thro' the burning Land his fruitful Tide; Benin's and Zara's unfrequented Plains, Unblest with cooling Winds and genial Rains. Each India's spacious Monarchies survey, Those at the Spring, these at the Ebb of Day, O'er which the Sun describes his Spiral Way. The various Realms disperst in Orient Seas, The wild Philippine Isles, and barbarous Celebees: Java, Sumatra, and Borneo's Land, And that which rude Golconda's Kings command: The Climes, where Siam's Lords the Scepter sway, And which Malacca's Potentates obey. Regard the Western-Indies, long unknown, Controul'd by Europe's Kings, or by their own. The Kingdoms neighbour to the sandy Shores, Where fam'd Hondura's Gulph resisted roars. The wealthy Regions of the Southern Soil, Where Foreign Lords enjoy the Natives Toil, And to Iberia's Ports convey the precious Spoil. And where the famous Amazonian Tide Do's thro' the Sands, like their own Serpents, glide. The various Nations of these various Lands, Opprest with scorching Heats, and Desart-Lands, Are, for the most, so ignorant and blind, So unreflecting, and so dull of Mind, They cast Reproach and Shame on Humane Kind. So void of Sense the Hotentot is found, Whose Speech is scarce articulated Sound, That 'tis disputed, if his doubtful Soul Augment the Humane or the Brutal Roll: Nor do's the Cafres barb'rous Race express More Marks of Wisdom, or of Dullness less. Ye Frontier Kingdoms, stretch'd on Guinea's Shore, Enrich'd with Ivory Wealth, and golden Oar; Ye Spicy-Isles, lav'd by the Indian Main, Count what your Losses are, and what your Gain: And will your Gold and Spices recompence Your Want of Thought, your Penury of Sense? Will ye your cruel Benefactor own, And bless th' immoderate Bounty of the Sun? As Rays direct are hurtful to the Mind, So by their Heat our Nature is inclin'd To various Passions, of destructive Kind. The vital Ferments they exalt so high, Their Dews exhal'd, the Channels grow so dry, That fiery Spirits rising from the Blood, Adust Extraction of the boiling Flood, Thro' all their fib'rous Paths malignant dart, Furious extend the Limbs, and fierce impel the Heart. The Fire, untemper'd with proportion'd Flegme, Scorches their Veins, and burns the Meagre Frame. These Spirits rais'd from Choler to the Brain, Like those extracted from the basest Grain, Impure and crude, produce unnatural Heat, And an ignoble Flame of Life create. The Natives hence no tender Motions find, No generous Passions agitate their Mind. Fierce is their Rage, and all the Savage Beast Reigns in their Soul, and haunts their desart Breast; Where Hate, Revenge, and Jealousy are bred, And livid Envy hides her spleenful Head. The Brute and Humane Animals acquire From these hot Skies alike intemperate Fire. The swarthy Nations near the Sun partake Of the fierce Viper, pois'nous Rattle-Snake, And Dragon, Bird obscene, which dreadful flies, Shoots forth his forked Tongue, and licks the Skies. Such was the Plague, that in Arabia's Sand, Stung Hebrews rescu'd from proud Pharoah's Hand; And round their Limbs in turgid Volumes clung, While with their Noise rehissing Mountains rung. Yet not Arabia's Sands, nor Lybia's Soil, Not Zara's Desart, nor the Banks of Nile, Fruitful of Terrors, yield a Savage Race, Which Ãgypt's King in Cruelty surpass. See where the Sun wastes his intenser Ray, The Cannibal, a Humane Beast of Prey, With more than brutal Fierceness drinks the Blood Of his own Kind, and makes their Limbs his Food. Th' Ãthiopian, and the Inland Moor, From Zanguebar's to Africk's adverse Shore, Merchants of Humane Nature still maintain Detested Trade, and sell their Race for Gain: Send their own Offspring Slaves to Foreign Soil, To sweat in Mines, or with incessant Toil To plant for British Lords some Indian Isle. Nor is the Glebe to Humane Nature kind, Between the Circles and the Poles confin'd. Nor the North Regions of the temperate Zone, Nor Southern Lands presumptive, tho' unknown. Where while th' unfriendly Sun do's Visits pay, So cold and short, he saves his precious Ray, And parsimonious makes the least Expence of Day. Mean Time in dark Abodes the Natives mourn His quick Departure, and his slow Return. See Nova Zembla's unfrequented Shores, Whence Scythia's Main reverberated roars: Iseland, a wild inhospitable Place, Which the North Sea's circumfluent Waves embrace. Greenland survey, on whose unfaithful Coast, Oft fixt in Ice th' advent'rous Ship is lost: Where the vast Lord of the Mute Clans, the Pride, As well as Terror, of the Ocean's Tide, Rolls in the troubled Deep, or wanton lies, Spouting the missive Seas against the Skies. Tartaria's Eastern Regions, and the Land Which far and wide Muscovia's Kings command; Where in unlightsome Caves the Nations pray For the short Comfort of returning Day; And Norway's Hills, whose Pines arise sublime, Which when transplanted to Britannia's Clime, Wing'd in her Fleets o'er all the Ocean roam, Export her Growth, and fetch the Indies Home. In all these Regions, from the Source of Light Remote and doom'd to long prevailing Night, See, Cold extream clasps in its rigid Arms Dishonour'd Nature, of their Strength disarms Her wither'd Limbs, and blasts her blooming Charms. See how she sickens by the chill Embrace, Behold her squallid Looks and ruin'd Face! While all her genial Ferments are detain'd With Ice coercive, and in Frost-work chain'd. Here Hyperborean Winds, that constant blow From crystal Caves, and Hoards immense of Snow, Tempestuous range the dreary Plains, and sweep The glaz'd Apartments of th' unactive Deep: Where cutting Sleet, bleak Gales, and beating Rain, Drive thro' the Air, and sweep along the Plain. This fruitless Soil, opprest with Cold intense, Is barren too of Wit, and void of Sense. Th' unsprightly, coarse, and unfermented Blood, Form'd of base Juices and unwholsome Food, Flows thick and lazy in the Venal Road. From this impure and unsubacted Mass, By a weak Fire sublim'd the Spirits pass Thro' the trajected Strainers of the Brain, And sluggish to the Nerves their Passage gain. Unlabour'd, unrefin'd, and slow of Course, They act the brawny Limbs, and give athletick Force. While thro' the nervous tough and subborn Thread Of larger Size and Bore they are convey'd, Vig'rous they move the lab'ring Heart, and warm, The winding Veins, with Strength the Muscles arm. Hence the hard Natives of the frozen Soil Robust of Sinew, and prepar'd for Toil, Patient of Pains, can unexhausted bear The Soldier's Buckler, or the Huntsman's Spear. These Spirits too, Guests of a torpid Brain, Will ling'ring Life prolong, and Health maintain. For with its hard constringent Grasp the Cold Shuts up the Pores, and do's their Flight with-hold; Which else expanded with a warmer Ray, Thro' larger Meshes soon would wing their Way, Defraud the Limbs, and lost in Ãther stray. Fed sparingly with Oyl, and dim with Fumes, The Vital Lamp by slow Expence consumes: While in hot Climes, unthrifty of its Fires, It blazes high, and wasting swift expires. But then these Spirits gross and unrefin'd, Slow Ministers, and Envoys of the Mind, Can ne'er on Vital Messages proceed, Or for Reports return with proper Speed; Swift thro' their nervous Channels cannot dart, No Touches bold or delicate impart: With no bright Figures furnish Fancy's Train, Nor grace with curious Imag'ry the Brain. The noble Functions of the Soul require A brighter Flame, and more exalted Fire. Mean Time the Realms, where Beams indulgent shine From the North Circle to the Tropic Line, Exempt from each Extream of Cold and Heat, To Human Nature prove a kinder Seat. The Sun here darts an oblique gentle Ray, Nor prodigal of Glory do's display Immoderate Splendor, or destructive Day. Here from the tepid Glebe sweet Vapours rise; Mild is the Air, and clement are the Skies. Soft Winds their balmy Burden here unload, And scatter genial Juices all Abroad. Prolifick Heat fermenting Nature warms, Gladdens her Face, and calls forth all her Charms. By this her teeming Bosom is supply'd With gay Abundance, and with verdant Pride. Flocks cloath'd with Fleeces crown the Mountain's Brow, And Herds beneath with Duggs distended low. In these propitious Climes th' embody'd Mind Do's happy Instruments, of various Kind, For all her noble Operations find. Here proper Ferments animate the Blood, And give just Vigour to the bounding Flood. The vital Streams with due impulsive Force Spring from the Heart, and triumph in their Course; Rarely a dull unagitated Mass Do's lazy linger in its circling Race: Nor do's a flaming rapid Torrent fry The winding Tubes, and leave the Muscles dry; While the mild Dews, forc'd with too great a Fire, Desert the Limbs, and thro' the Pores perspire. The Purple Streams, warm to a just Degree, From Dregs and unconcocted Juices free, As they pervade the Channels of the Brain, Their purer Parts thro' the fine Meshes strain. These active Liquors, which Admission find Thro' the strait Paths, and leave the coarse behind, Swift to the inmost Rooms their Passage beat, And crowd around the Soul's Imperial Seat; Of subtile Matter form'd, refin'd and bright, As Light'ning sprightly, and serene as Light, Watching their Soveraign's Nod, they ready stand Apt to perform the Mind's supream Command. Such noble Vital Instruments are fit For Reason's Works, and beauteous Turns of Wit. With finer Strokes they move the tender Strings Tun'd in the Brain, whence clear Perception springs. When Fancy makes superior Flight her Aim, Wing'd with this vig'rous, clear seraphick Flame, She ranges Nature's universal Frame; Bright Seeds of Thought from various Objects takes, Whence her fair Scenes and Images she makes: Spirits so swift, so fine, so bold, so strong, Gave Milton Genius fit for Milton's Song. Others have Spirits volatile and gay, Which in the Brain, like darting Meteors, play, Or Atomes dancing in the solar Ray. Tho' these with Strength Divine can never rise, Nor stretch the daring Wing in upper Skies: Yet sportive with their Wit, that flows with Ease, And Humour, they the Taste in Fashion please. In Raillry fine, in Conversation bright, They now with Praises sooth, and now with Satyre bite. As lighter Airs th' ignoble Audience charm, Whom the Divine Scarlatti cannot warm, So Sports of Fancy please the People's Ear, Who cold the Epick Inspiration hear. Of either Kind a Genius we should prize, One makes us laugh, as One would make us wise. For different Ends the busy Head is fill'd With different Spirits from the Blood distill'd: Behold in some, these Agents of the Mind Mild, but exalted, active and refin'd; And from the sharp and sullen Vapours freed, Which from the Bile, and anxious Spleen proceed, Dart to the Soul a pure, and easy Ray, Serene as Morn, and sweet as Eden's Day: Gentle and soft, as tepid, genial Rains, Inspire a kindly Warmth thro' all the Veins: Dispos'd around the Mind's High Judgment-Seat, They give abundant Light, but moderate Heat. When Spirits temper'd thus combine, we own A Fleetwood sorm'd, a Lock, or Tillotson. In some the Spirits their rich Store diffuse, Drawn from a Mixture of digested Dews And equal Fire, which purer Choler joyns, And the high Ferment of the Spleen refines. These plenteous rise, and with their radiant Train Fill all th' Apartments of th' inlighten'd Brain. They burn, without exhaling Vapours, bright, And give a clear and comprehensive Sight, Piercing Inspection, and attentive Thought, Where Nature's Steps are trac'd, and Schemes of Science wrought. From Spirits thus dispos'd expect to see A Wren, a Newton, or a Gregory. Those, which the able Statesman's Head inspire, Approach yet nearer to Etherial Fire. These by their frequent Sublimations pure, Mellow by long Digestion, and mature; Justly attemper'd with proportion'd Flegme, And to a certain Height exalted, frame A noble, generous, strong, and steddy Flame; Which thro' the Brain Meridian Lustre spreads, Mild as the Glory, which a Seraph sheds. This Flame is vig'rous, lasting, clear, serene, And darts not outward, while it shines within. Hence Judgment flows, and Thoughts sagacious, hence Come steddy Temper, and superior Sense. This makes a Master to direct a State, And forms the Man denominated Great. Give to the Brain such Guests as these, and we New Burleighs, and new Walsinghams shall see. And may Britannia's Soil with Spirit stor'd, And blest with Genius, still a Race afford In Council able, and with Prudence crown'd, Not less for Wisdom, than for Arms renown'd, In Action warm, and in Designing cool, Mighty to conquer, and as fit to rule. Nor do's the wild intemperate Zone admit Religion's Empire more than that of Wit, Alike for Sense and Piety unfit. Survey the Regions near th' Ãquator Line, To Congo's Sands from swarthy Abyssine, The Nations spread on Guinea's golden Shore, The tawny, black, the long, and short-hair'd Moor, Who drink the Niger, or the Nile adore; That People barbarous Madagascar's Soil, Camboia's Kingdom, and Mindano's Isle, Who range like Savage Beasts, the Hill and Wood, Unciviliz'd, and naked snatch their Food, Nature's pure Growth, and drink the ready Flood. These stupid Nations, this degenerate Race, Can scarce the Being of their Maker trace, Tho' Marks of Pow'r Divine shine bright on Nature's Face. And those, who Altars for Religion raise, To Demons, not to Gods, direct their Praise. Soon as th' unhappy Head of Humane Kind, By secret Guile and flatt'ring Arts inclin'd, Had (fatal Choice!) embrac'd th' Impostor's Cause, Abjur'd his Soveraign, and despis'd his Laws; Inflicted Mists, and Shades of penal Night Involv'd his Offspring, and perplex'd their Sight: Hence, lost in various Error, they ador'd Some Fellow-Creature, as their Maker-Lord; And mumerous Kinds of Idols did revere, The Objects of their Love, or of their Fear. Some deify'd the Seraph-Race, that fell From bright celestial Thrones, condemn'd to dwell In Falshood's dark Abodes, and reign accurs'd in Hell. While these Fall'n-Angels, Princes of the Air, From their low Seats to ours, did oft repair, To manage here their Empire, to preside O'er warring Winds, and wrathful Tempests guide, To ripen Plagues, and Torments to dispense, To scourge Mankind, and punish bold Offence; Mistaken Man, by Terrors thus alarm'd, Bow'd to the Pow'rs with so much Vengeance arm'd: And to the fierce Tormentors Fanes did reer; While Demons thus were first made Gods by Fear. Th' Apostate Spirits proud to be ador'd, And vie in Honours with their Soveraign Lord; In various Climes appointed various Modes, By which th' Usurpers were aton'd as Gods. In Person some, disguis'd in Humane Shape, Met their Adorers, some assum'd the Ape. The Satyr's Form some did capricious chuse, Some did the Goat's, and some the Serpent's use; Others were pleas'd, from different Taste of Pride, Unseen in various Idols to reside: Temples and Domes were rais'd, the high Abodes Of wing'd, four-footed, and of reptile Gods. Some did the Town, and some the Desart love; These chose the Hill, and those the shady Grove. Here burning Incense sooth'd their Nostrils, there They view'd the prost'rate Crowd, and heard their abject Pray'r. Here impious Priests, full of the Demon Guest, With trembling Limbs and agitated Breast, Exclaiming loud the Fiend within confest. While some with Rites uncouth, and hollow Notes Exploded frightful thro' their lab'ring Thoats, From murm'ring Bowels raving did dispense Dark Oracles, and Words of doubtful Sense, As Evil Spirits were by Men implor'd, So Good, their own Invention, were ador'd. Such Deities their Guardian Genij were, Who rul'd wide Realms, or made great Towns their Care; And those, who still assiduous did attend Their Fav'rite's Person, and his Life defend: Such those commission'd to protect their Tow'rs, And guard their Walls against invading Pow'rs; And Lares, plain, familiar, inmate Gods, Who watchful kept their Votaries Abodes. Those of their Race, who useful Arts did find, Or blest with gen'rous Labour Humane Kind, By States too grateful were enrol'd Divine, And mid'st the Stars did Gods illustrious shine. Bacchus, and Ceres, who obtain'd a Place High in the Heav'ns among th' Immortal Race, Their Priests and Altars to their Skill did owe; One taught to plant the Vine, and One to sow. Robust Alcides, whose heroick Toil, From Plagues and Monsters freed his Native Soil, By Strength Athletick climb'd to Heav'n and rais'd His Temples by the Club, which rescu'd Nations prais'd. On Ãsculapius Altars they bestow'd, First their Physician, and at length their God. Some duller yet of Reason, more debase The Dignity of Man's superior Race, While stupid they with sacred Honours crown Creatures of Rank inferior to their own; Worship wild Inmates, which the Woods infest, The Desart's Terror, or the Mountain's Guest, That walk, and run, or on their Bellies creep, Traverse the Air, or range the spacious Deep. Rude Africk Realms, far from the Tropic Lines, On which the Sun, profuse of Glory, shines, Abject, their own Destroyers idolize, And stock with Monster-Gods th' affronted Skies. The wild and barb'rous Nations of the Land, That stretches near the ErythrÃ¦an Strand, The Viper, Snake, and Basilisk adore, And from their Plagues and Torments Aid implore. Ãgypt bow'd down before the Crocodile, Who fierce infests their other God, the Nile; The Terror That, and This the Blessing of their Soil. While Heroes dead, and Demons were prefer'd To Thrones Divine, and Beasts were Gods declar'd, Ev'n Herbs themselves, cheap verdant Deities, From Earth transplanted, flourish'd in the Skies. Ãgypt in Garden Pow'rs her Safety plac'd, Divinities of high delicious Taste: Her Sons, like modern Rome, their Gods did eat, Who fixt in Domes, or on their Tables set, Did raise Devotion now, and now their Hunger treat. Some lifting to the glorious Sun and Skies Magnificent with Stars, their wond'ring Eyes In Error lost, took for their Maker God His Throne refulgent and August Abode. But Muse return, and thy first Aim pursue, With closer Flight, and with less distant View. Nor do the Nations which inhabit near Arcturus, and the never-setting Bear, In Nova Zembla, and Iselandia's Isle, In Lapland Hills, and bleak Muscovia's Soil, More noble Dictates of Religion own, Than the Brute Kingdoms of the Torrid Zone. This heav'nly Plant, which Life Divine bestows, Rare in incliment Air successful grows, 'Tis scorcht with Libia's Heats, and nip'd with Russia's Snows. 'Tis true th' Almighty can with Ease display O'er dull benighted Realms celestial Day; And to th' unaptest Natures can impart Transforming Pow'r, and with unerring Art Bend the reluctant Will, and new create the Heart, Yet who shall tax his Goodness, who arraign Of Providence Divine the secret Chain, If chief we see his Blessings the Reward Of Thoughts more Humane, and of Minds prepar'd? Nations, 'tis known, with finer Nature blest, And Sense and Wit superior to the rest, Soonest Divine Religion's Charms discern, Meet the blest Teacher, and her Dictates learn. And hence, ye various Nations dull of Thought, To near the Solar Orb, or too remote, Stupid of Mind, and obstinate of Will, Unconscious of the Rules of Good and Ill, Rarely your Souls to pious Acts incline, Or feel th' impulsive Force of Light Divine: Obdurate, rarely in your yielding Breast, You entertain the Beatifick Guest. Your Hearts, as barren as your Rocks and Sand, Her Charms and pow'rful Influence withstand; Whose heav'nly Rays defeated thence recoil, Like Sun-Beams wasted on unfruitful Soil. Know, hardy Atheists, who insulting say Some populous Realms to Gods no Homage pay, And therefore Nature's universal Law Imprints not on the Mind Religious Awe; That those, who no superior Being own, Are more from Beasts by Shape, than Reason known. Then impious Maxims, which affront the Skies, From Want of Wit, and not Abundance rise. The End of the First Book. BOOK II. The Argument. The Character of the French Nation: Their Virtues and Vices. Of the Spaniard. Of the Inhabitants of the Northern Coast of Africa stretching along the Mediterranean-Sea. Of the Italians. Of the Germans. Of the People of the United-Netherlands. Of the Britons. An Episodical Digression, in Praise of British Liberty. The Britons Vices. Now see what Genius of distinguish'd Kind, What Passions, Manners more or less refin'd, What Vice, what Virtue, eminent their own, Make Neighbour Nations from each other known. Fertile of Spirit, Sense, and subtile Wit, Gallia affords a Race of Natives fit For high Command, for Schools and liberal Arts, Yet not alike in all her various Parts. The temperate Tracts view'd by the distant Sun, With Rays more slanting, which extended run From Bourbon's healing Waters to the Coast, Where in the Main fair Sequana is lost, Excel the rest, and more abundant yield Sense for the Court, and Courage for the Field. The brightest Stars, that Honour Gallia's Skies, Neighbours to Britain's Southern Empire rise. 'Tis to this Soil the boastful Kingdom owes Her fam'd Cartesius, here her Calvin rose. The nearer they approach th' Ãquator Line, The thinner, and less beautiful they shine. From their pure Air, and mild, delightful Seat, Where the contending Rivals, Cold and Heat, Maintain a constant Balance, while they strive With equal Vigour, Gallia's Sons derive That Ease and Joy, which show them free from Care, Their active Nature, and their sprightly Air. While Reason's brighter Beams adorn their Mind, Of Thought acute, and Faculties refin'd, Ready they frame Perceptions, whence the Brain Is fill'd abundant with a busy Train Of Images, which lively, light and gay Range all its Walks, and thro' th' Apartments play, Good Humour give, and cheerful Scenes display. The Gauls with finer Spirits still abound, More for Discernment, than for Wit renown'd, Which yet they do not want, nor are with plenty crown'd. And tho' their Fancy is not rich and strong, Not vig'rous, bold, and fit for Epick Song, Their Taste is exquisite, and Judgment right; And hence they censure, better than they write. Weak and diluted Notions they dispense, Their Thoughts not full, nor sinewy their Sense. Their Words not great, yet beautiful and clean, And tho' too oft their Sentiments are lean, We still conceive with ease, the Thing they mean. Polite of Manners, easy of Access, With winning Phrase, and elegant Address, Courteous th' enquiring Stranger they Caress. Graceful and fluent, and in speaking clear, At once they please the Eye, and sooth the Ear. Active, industrious, and intent on Gain, Gallia, thy Sons incessant Toil sustain. Frugal and temperate in their Food and Wine, Tho' both delicious, they Excess decline. Hence they their known Alacrity maintain, Their Bodies healthful, and serene their Brain. Splendid in Houses, Equipage, and Dress, For Show and Pomp their Passion they express. Fawning and servile to the Great they bow, While scornful they insult the Mean and Low: They thirst for Praise immod'rate, and proclaim In fulsome Stile, a Benefactor's Name; And when their lawless Monarch is the Theme, To court a Tyrant, they their God blaspheme. They boast with hasty Pride each small Success, And as small Losses soon their Souls depress; Still in Extreams their Passions they employ, Abject their Grief, and insolent their Joy. Matchless in Treaties, they the Ear amuse With doubtful Phrase, and Words of various use, And with unfeign'd Hypocrisy abuse. To work their Aim they still new Methods find, Traverse their Course, and sail against the Wind. Gamesters in Politicks, they know the Way To win, is still to bring new Frauds in play. This mean ungenerous Race, for Thraldom fit, Obsequious to the Yoke their Necks submit. Their abject Minds ev'n Liberty disdain, Pleas'd to be Slaves, they boast the Tyrant's Reign, And servile hug their ignominious Chain. The Gaul by Nature is not cruel made, Nor secret in Revenge do's Life invade. But then the Fierceness, which his Clime denies, Plenteous his false Religion's Flame supplies. Inverted Zeal! whose Dictates can controul All inbred Goodness, and corrupt the Soul. Tell, great Lutetia, how thy Sons, refin'd From the good Passions of a generous Mind, Devout Assassins grew, and to asswage Their Lust of Slaughter, and Religious Rage, Did all thy Streets with holy Murder stain, And fill thy high Apartments with the Slain; Did their feirce Hands with crimson Seas pollute, And terrible in Arms proud Heresy confute. The Solar Rays, to which th' Iberian Race, Owe their lean Bodies, and their swarthy Face, Unqualify'd by proper Cold, inspire Their scalded Veins with too intense a Fire. Whence from the glowing Heart the rushing Tide Thro' the hot Channels do's impetuous ride; And while the Streams, thinn'd by immod'rate Heat, Break thro' the Skin, and thro' the Strainers sweat, The boiling Floods of high fermented Juice Too fiery Spirits in the Brain produce. And since the Passions, which the Heart surprize, All from the Spirits various Nature rise, On which the Mind's high Faculties depend, While they Ideas frame, or choose an End: The Cause of Spanish Temper here we find, Why to such Virtues, and such Faults inclin'd. Th' Iberian makes his Honour chief his Care, Nice in his Taste, and in his Rules severe. In Friendship steddy, faithful to his Trust, True to his Prince, and to his Neighbour just, Arm'd in the Field he feels the martial Flame, Tastful of Glory, and the Hero's Name, He do's in Fight intrepid Courage show, Ardent attacks, or firm sustains the Foe. Religious he performs his solemn Vows, And no elusive Subterfuge allows, Unless from Rome's dispensing Pow'r it flows. Able in Council, and for Action born, Heroes and Statesmen once did long adorn Iberia's Land, her Empire did defend, And with her Frontier did her Fame extend. Success her Schemes, and Vict'ry crown'd her Arms, While distant Kingdoms shook at her Alarms. This shews her happy Soil fit Men can yield To rule the State, or conquer in the Field. Her Men of Genius merit great Renown By Wit and Sense, and Humour, all their own; Yet, like their Beauties, they are thinly sown. And both these Kinds that grace their Native Sphere, Of the first Rank and Magnitude appear. But haughty Pride and Idleness efface Part of the Glory of the Spanish Race. On Neighbours round they look disdainful, proud Of their unmingled, old Castilian Blood. They take up Honour on their Father's Grant, While Merit, not their own, th' Usurpers vaunt; Believe the Hero is entail'd, and claim In a right Line Hereditary Fame. Of Toil impatient, they their Hours employ In soft Delights, and various Scenes of Joy. Amours to them, and frequent Feasts are dear, And all th' exalted Pleasures of the Ear. But if too poor such costly Sweets to taste, Their wretched Lives in sullen Sloth they waste. Careless the Natives and unactive stand, Mindless to plough the Ocean, or the Land. Unthrifty they consume their gather'd Store, Spite of th' Indies destin'd to be poor; Indies which more industrious Neighbours drain, Enjoy the Thing, and leave the Name to Spain. Immortal Hatred and malicious Will, O Spain, the Bosoms of thy Natives fill. Too near advanc'd to Mauritania's Shore, They feel the Passions of the cruel Moor. Witness, ye peaceful Indian Nations, you Who peopled Mexico and till'd Peru: What Racks, what Tortures of distinguish'd Kind, Able in Torment did your Masters find, Frugal of Death, tho' liberal of Pain, To sink your Stock, and plant the Growth of Spain? To sooth the Spaniard's raging Lust of Blood, From your exhausted Veins what Rivers flow'd? From your unhappy Seats, what dreadful Cries, What Groans did long uninterrupted rise, And form infernal Noise amid'st the howling Skies? Nor do's in Spain her self the Trav'ller see Less odious Marks of Spanish Cruelty. Witness the Fate of her own Native Moor, Proscrib'd, destroy'd, and banish'd from her Shore, Nor guarded by the Oaths Castilia's Monarch swore. Yet their Lay-Fierceness we indignant see Is mild compar'd with Clergy-Cruelty; These Reverend Tyrants, absolute of Will, With fetter'd Slaves their sacred Prisons fill. And stock their heav'nly Labour-Houses, where The curious Artists Men for Heav'n prepare On Racks of Holy Use contriv'd with studious Care. With Engines, form'd by Art Divine, they wrest Pernicious Error from the stubborn Breast, And with celestial Piety endu'd Scourge Hereticks to Heav'n, and force them to be good. The Tawny Race, that People Africk's Land, Between the Northern Tropick and the Strand, Whose Barrier-Rocks and rising Sands restrain Th' insulting Billows of the Midland Main, Scotcht by a near and more inclement Sun, In Sense and Virtue is by Spain outdone; But not in great Degree, for near the Coast The Natives Genius and Reflection boast. Witness the Race in ancient Carthage born, Who bright in Virtue, Africk did adorn. Valiant they strove with Rome's Ambitious State, Rival in Arms, with undecided Fate To which the Subject World should Homage pay, Thy Laws, O Rome, or, Carthage, thine obey. Till Discord, Faction, Strife too fierce to tame, And Envy kindled by th' unrival'd Fame Of the great Heroes, who their Armies led, And far and wide their Praise and Terror spread, Soon broke the Punick Pow'rs, and made them yield, Victors till then, the long contested Field. And had some noble Carthaginian Pen, Wrote the brave Actions of their valiant Men, Greater Esteem perhaps we should express To Africk Heroes, and to Roman less. May Britons ne'er by Envy's Pow'r misled, A Vice by bright Heroick Virtue bred, Madly their flowing Tide of Fortune stem, Nor Victory forsake, e'er that abandons them. Nor after did these Regions less abound With Men of Wit, with Sense and Virtue crown'd And for celestial Piety renown'd. Here did the various Luminaries rise Of the first Order in the Christian Skies. Tertullian, Cyprian, and Augustine, bred In this warm Land, did Light abundant spread, And more than rival'd Rome's aspiring Head. Yet lasting Hate, Resentment, Pride and Spleen, Revenge, and Cruelty, and haughty Mien, More than in Spain, are here conspicuous seen. Hesperia's Soil, which turbid Adria's Waves, And th' Hetrurian adverse Billows lave, Whence humid Vapours still exhaling rise, Sooth the hot Air, and qualify the Skies, A middle Disposition do's obtain, Not mild as Gallia, nor so hot as Spain. Hence she affords a Race distinct from both, From Gallick Lightness free, and Spanish Sloth. A lofty Genius in her Natives shines, For Empire turn'd, and apt for vast Designs. Witness the Heroes, who in ancient Days, By Actions worthy of Immortal Praise, From Pole to Pole, Ausonia's Fame did spread, And made high Rome the World's Imperial Head. When mighty Storms, which in the North arose, From Alba's Banks, and Scandinavia's Snows, To fair Hesperia threat'ning bent their Course, And rushing down her Hills with rapid Force, Had with their Thunder Rome's proud Empire broke, And made her Neck receive a Foreign Yoke, Behold a Scheme form'd by unvulgar Sense; Thy subtile Sons, O Rome, to recompense Their Loss of Pow'r, did Means successful find To found a wider Empire o'er the Mind. Witness the mitred Monarchs, who controul Reluctant Conscience, and command the Soul. Who, as erroneus, Nature's Light asperse; The Judgment, which our Senses pass, reverse; And by th' usurp'd Authority of Heav'n Repeal the just Decrees by Reason giv'n: Who Schemes of new Religion have enjoyn'd, Impos'd Belief, enslav'd the free-born Mind, And artful by the manag'd World to come, Have conquer'd this, and Heav'n annex'd to Rome; Possest of all the dreadful Strength of Hell, Its Magazines of Pain and Death, compel The Earth's affrighted Nations to obey Proud Rome's Command, and own her Soveraign Sway: To compass this, Ausonia must abound With Genius strong and vast, and Thought profound. Here rose the sacred Machiavellian Kind, Of subtile Head, and Politicks refin'd, Fruitful of Projects, and in Council great, Fit to support, or undermine a State. Open and free, while most reserv'd, expert To dress Designs, and act a double Part, Most artful, when they seem most free from Art. Solemn they vow, but still their Minds suppress, Intending Ruin while they most caress. This happy Land in all her various Parts, Has still been friendly to the liberal Arts; But chief the Regions, which their Wealth display Between the Mountains and the Midland Sea. The Sun and Soil indulgent here conspire To raise bright Genius and Poetick Fire. Hence rise distinguish'd Bards of every Kind, Fertile of Thought, and elevated Mind; Some fit in Azure Heights to stretch the Wing, And in superior Lays heroick Virtue sing: And some with humble Flight to range the Plains; The Hills and Groves, and tell in gentle Strains The Labours, and the Loves of Rural Swains. Of the great Pair, who yet unrivall'd shine In Epick Song, Italia, Virgil's Thine; And where's the Voice admir'd for Lyrick Lays, That with thy Horace merits equal Praise? In Musick too th' Ausonians, nice of Taste, Unmatch'd in Skill their Neighbours still surpast, Whether they strike th' extended Vocal String, Or eloquent in Sound some tender Passion sing. When Margarita moves us with her Song Melodious, artful, delicate and strong; When Nicolini we in Rapture hear, Whose Motion charms the Sight, and Voice the Ear; Surpriz'd Italia's Genius we admire, None sing so sweet, as none so touch the Lyre. Strangers amaz'd see how her stately Rooms, Her gilded Tow'rs and elevated Domes, Matchless Productions of the Painter boast, Which all his fertile Energy exhaust: Where Skill Divine great Raphael do's exert, And Nature re-create with rival Art: See, Plants in verdant Fields of Canvass rise, And Birds ascend in well-imagin'd Skies. The Herds and Flocks, the Pencil's Creatures, fill Th' extended Vally, and adorn the Hill: On Humane Limbs it Shape and Strength bestows, While vital Fire in kindling Colours glows, Makes the strong Lines a living Aspect wear, And in the Eyes the whole bright Soul appear. Here too illustrious Architects abound, Tho' few in Buonarota's Sphere are found. Her lofty Structures to the Skies aspire, While to reveal their Pride the Clouds retire. How much her Domes and Palaces delight, Where Order, Pomp, Magnificence and Height, Beauty and Strength conspire to please the Sight! Yet Jealous, Proud, with quick Resentment fir'd, Reluctant to Forgiveness, and inspir'd By secret Fury, with clandestine Arms, Italia's Sons revenge imagin'd Harms. The pois'nous Plant of Cruelty do's here Luxuriant spring, and Fruits full ripen'd bear. What Seas of Blood were with unrivall'd Guilt By Sylla's Hand, and thine, fierce Marius, spilt? How did the dire Proscriptions of the Three, Octavius, Lepidus, and Anthony, Pollute high Rome with Heaps of noble Dead, And Streets with moist Patrician Purple spread? How did her Neroes, and their Tyrant Race, Imperial Plagues, the Terrour and Disgrace Of Humane Kind, regale their greedy Eyes With Scenes of Death, their Ears with Groans and Cries? Yet guilty Rome, thy Neroes, Maximins, And all the Tyrants of the Pagan Lines, Who red with Slaughter fill'd th' Imperial Throne, Are by thy Christian Potentates out-gone. With pure celestial Piety endu'd, They Humane Nature from their Breasts exclude, And fill their Hands, they lift to Heav'n, with Blood. These Sons of Wrath, this unrelenting Tribe, Condemn whole Nations, and their Kings proscribe. Doom Crowds of guiltless Men to cruel Chains, To Death, and after to infernal Pains; And their immortal Cruelty extend Beyond the Grave, where all Lay-Torments end. Now view the Regions, which their Fields display, From the wild Shores of Adria's boist'rous Sea, And from the Alps, thrown up by Nature's Hand, High Frontier Lines to guard Ausonia's Land, To Albia's Mouth, and the rough Swevic Waves, And from the Banks, which rapid Rhinus laves, To the East Regions of th' Hircynian Wood, Sarmatian Hills, and fair Odera's Flood. These numerous Nations, where the Sun displays His oblique Glory, and less active Rays, Are in proportion less acute, and more Unapt for Thought, than those describ'd before, Hence finer Spirits here do less abound, And noble Poets are unfrequent found. Yet this Defect their Tempers recompence With a judicious Taste, and solid Sense; Prudent, tho' not in Conversation bright, Not rude as Russia, nor as France polite; And tho' they rare as Wits or Criticks shine, Or Schemes of dark Philosophy design, Yet useful Knowledge studious they pursue, Improve invented Arts, or find out new. They shew a plain Simplicity of Mind, Honest, tho' rough; sincere, tho' not refin'd. Faith, Friendship, and Integrity they boast, Virtues long since in well-bred Nations lost. Of Sloth impatient, and the downy Bed, Not with rich Wines, nor costly Dishes fed, Pliant they keep their Limbs, their Sinews strong, Maintain firm Health, and active Life prolong. Hence Toil immense the hardy Natives bear, Patient of trackless Land, and rig'rous Air, If with the Huntsman's Arms they chase the Game, Or with the Soldier's seek heroick Fame. Nor do's the rolling Sun a Soil survey, In all the Stages of his annual Way, Which yields more martial Fire, and where we find To Strength of Body so much Courage join'd. The Laurel, which rewards the Hero's Toil, Luxuriant grows in all this friendly Soil. The warlike Youth controul the haughty Race, Who rule Byzantium, and inhabit Thrace; And bold in Arms, with like Success, repel The Seine's proud Waters, when they threatning swell. Yet Cruelty and untam'd Fierceness, Crimes The frequent Growth of Military Climes, And haughty Nature, do too much debase The Name and Honour of the German Race. Oft with the strong Extraction of their Grain, They cloud their Senses, and inflame their Brain, While in their Breasts unbridled Passions reign. Britons, their Sons, hence learn'd th' immod're use Of Wine, and strong intoxicating Juice. Regard Batavia, whose well peopled Plain, By Art is wrested from th' indignant Main. Her moist, but fruitful Glebe and temp'rate Skies, Produce a Stock industrious, frugal, wise. 'Tis true, their humid Air and marshy Field Do not abundant Wit and Fancy yield, Yet while their moderate, but prevailing Flegme Restrains the Spirits too impetuous Flame, They reason well, and just Ideas frame. Than Her's, few Statesmen boast a clearer Sight, Their Views extensive, and their Judgment right: Nor for their Country's happy State reveal More ardent Love, or more intrepid Zeal. Forc'd by the narrow Limits of their Land, Th' industrious People leave their Native Strand, And on the Product of the Billows live, While what the Soil denies, the Waters give. Nor are they only by the Ocean fed, While Winds and Waves afford them Wine and Bread; But more, their Sons, who ignorant of Sloth, O'erspread the Seas, import the Arts and Growth, The various Pride of every distant Soil; Out-rival'd only by Britannia's Isle, They send their numerous Colonies abroad, And with Barbarick Wealth their Navies load: Thus from strait Bounds their wide Dominion flows, And from their Want their great Abundance grows. This Region, so we learn from CÃ¦sar's Pen, Of all the Belgians bred the bravest Men. Of Freedom then they shew'd a generous Taste, And the fierce Pow'rs, that laid their Neighbours waste, Valiant in Arms their Cohorts did attack, And from their Frontiers drove th' Invaders back. And while Iberia's Monarchs they obey'd, Of all the Tribes o'er wide Germania spread, None did the Sword with greater Terror weild, Nor won more Laurels in the Martial Field. When after free, to Commerce they apply'd, Studious of Wealth, they were by few out-vy'd. Swift they arose to that prodigious Growth, That they at once reproach'd Iberia's Sloth, And screen'd her Empire by their friendly Pow'r, Beneath whose Yoke they servile groan'd before. Fair Industry, what Voice can sing thy Praise, Which could so soon with Skill successful raise A Spot of scarcely habitable Land, To Wealth immense, Renown, and wide Command! Then is it strange, Batavians so revere This Founder of their State, and so adhere To her instructive Precepts, who are blest With the rich Bounty of this generous Guest? But Avarice do's thro' their Nation reign, Intent on Gold they all their Sinews strain, And oft by Fraud, or Force, extort unrighteous Gain. Of vulgar Taste, and Manners unrefin'd, Seditious, fierce, and turbulent of Mind, When strong Commotions vex their troubled State, They cruel Nature shew, and deadly Hate. Nor can they neighb'ring Northern Realms upbraid, While lawless they intoxicate their Head With Native Liquors, or with Foreign Wine, From Gallia's Fields, or those that bound the Rhine. To vertuous Deeds the Britons are inclin'd, Their Manners not too rough, nor too refin'd; Sincere of Heart, and generous, just and kind. Industrious and intent on honest Gain, Robust of Nerve, they various Toil sustain: They plant the Garden, cultivate the Field, Or bold in Arms the Spear and Fauchion wield. Studious they send Abroad to needy Lands, The Product of their Glebe, or Labour of their Hands. Hardy their Annual Voyages perform, And fearless ride familiar with the Storm. Thro' yielding Waves they roam from Isle to Isle, Now visit Russia's Snows, now Guinea's Soil. Hence in Hesperia's Silks the Britons shine, Wear India's Gems, and drink Burgundia's Wine. Their floating Oaks of War, from Shore to Shore Awful advance, and with loud Thunder roar, Like what they suffer'd on the Hills before. And by the Winds, like that, convey'd it rolls From Sun to Sun, and shakes the distant Poles. This Naval Pow'r the Merchant's Wealth defends, And Albion's Empire o'er the Main extends. Nor do we Britain's Soil unfruitful find Of Men for Council and the Helm design'd, Able, when Clouds and Winds sedious rise, To check the Tempest, and relieve the Skies; Or in the Storm with steddy Hand to steer The fluctuating State, and ease her Fear. Nor do's Britannia less abundant yield Heroes to lead her Armies to the Field. Both these secure their Country's happy Fate, While One defends, and One directs the State. From this exhaustless Soil still springs a Kind, Blest with superior Sense, and brighter Mind: With clear Seraphick Faculties adorn'd, For Science some, and some for Business turn'd. Hence, Cam and Ouze, your Lights Divine arise, That grace Britannia's fair exempted Skies, While on the Southern Realm thick Roman Darkness lies. These Regions plenteous yield the noble Flame, Which gives the Bard impulsive Thirst of Fame, Rich Genius, Fancy delicate and strong, And bright Ideas for the Epick Song: A sprightly Thought, good Taste, and Humour fit To sooth the Spleen, and form the Comick Wit. Wit is a Native of this happy Isle, It springs spontaneous from the kindly Soil; By its own Force it perfect will become, Fair Branches spread, and wear a noble Bloom. Ripe Fruit adorns her Head, nor can the Frown Of Fortune blast, or Hunger eat it down. A British Muse from her own Instinct sings, Ambitious soars with unassisted Wings: Mindless of Pensions, and the Patron's Smile, Our Poets still renew their hardy Toil. The tuneful Genius here neglected grows, And thrives, like Norway Pines, in Ice and Snows. 'Tis true exhausted with continu'd Pains In singing Marlbro's Toil, and great Campaigns, They now sit silent to recruit their Veins; Nor can their tuneful Contributions pay, But plead their Poverty, and Patience pray. They have unsung more Triumphs on their Hand, Than unheard Causes on the Roll did stand, When W? our Court of Conscience did command. Victorious Hero! in Compassion give The panting Muses Time to breathe, and live. Let them to Quarters of Refreshment go, Their Genius there reviv'd again will flow To sing thy Actions in a lofty Strain, And Laurels won in this last great Campaign. Attending then the Progress of thy Sword, Which still new Themes of Rapture will afford, They'll tell of Vict'ries struggling in the Womb Of pregnant Time, and Triumphs yet to come. While Neighb'ring Realms, too course or too polite, To lawless Will resign their Civil Right, Britannia's brave and generous Sons restrain Invading Might, and ancient Laws maintain. When Happiness, Guest of celestial Kind, Rang'd the wide Globe a peaceful Seat to find; With outstretcht Wings she did her Way pursue, Fame, to direct her Flight, before her flew. Curious th' Enquirer did the Realms explore, Rich with the glitt'ring Mass that Men adore, Wide India's Silver Veins, and Guinea's golden Shore, The lovely Stanger turn'd her scornful Face, And left the rude inhospitable Place. Then swift, as Heav'ns bright Envoys, did she fly Thro' the thin Void of interjected Sky, To visit Realms blest with Euphrates' Wave, Which Indus' Streams, and thine, Hydaspes, lave. Her searching Eyes the Spicy-Isles survey, And frontier Kingdoms near the Spring of Day, Enrich'd with various Luxury, Perfumes, Silks, Gems, and Pearls, and odoriferous Gums. But when she saw the abject Slaves endure, The Yoke of Lawless Will, and boundless Pow'r, She left the Soil, and, following Fame, her Guide, Flew to the Courts, where mighty Kings abide. Here, grac'd with Purple, and a glitt'ring Crown, Guarded with Arms, and stretch'd on easy Down, She hop'd she might reside; but Cares of State, Infernal Legions, that attend the Great, Deny'd her Entrance at the Palace Gate. Then long she roam'd o'er fertile Europe's Soil, And reach'd at length august Britannia's Isle; The Native's Temper, and the gentle Air, Rescu'd the weary Trav'ller from Despair, And rais'd her Hope she might inhabit there. Following the Track of Thames, on either side Fair Towns and verdant Vales she ravish'd spy'd, And Indian Wealth advancing on his Tide. Envy'd Augusta soon she did explore, Britannia's Glory on the Northern Shore, Proud of her lofty Tow'rs, but of her People more. In the West Quarter of the winding Flood, An ancient Palace venerable stood Between two Domes, which rise with solemn Awe, In one Religion reigns, in one the Law. Here on her Throne fair Liberty did shine, Engaging was her Form, her Looks divine. Still pleas'd, with Grace ineffable she smil'd, Serene as Peace, and as a Seraph mild. Celestial Odours from her Bosom spread, While heav'nly Roses blossom'd round her Head; Elysian Youth bloom'd lovely on her Face, And more than human Charms assur'd her heav'nly Race. Five Hundred chosen Freemen, her Delight, Props of her Pow'r, and Guardians of her Right, Check'd the proud Insults of ambitious Might. Her beauteous Offspring to the Skies ally'd, In graceful Order rang'd on either Side Adorn her Throne; here smiling Plenty, Peace, Health, Strength, Success, Prosperity and Ease; There Prudence, Counsel, Sciences refin'd, Rich Industry, and Arts of various Kind. Soon the Seraphick Trav'ller had in view This ancient Pile, and swiftly thither flew: And stooping enter'd at the Palace Gate, Where the mild Guardian of Britannia's State, And generous Friend of Humane Nature sate; While she survey'd the venerable Place, And view'd fair Liberty's celestial Face, Who, mid'st her bright Attendants, shone enthron'd, She lowly bow'd, and her blest Parent own'd. Determin'd soon, the charming Wand'rer cry'd, Here, here, I fix; in Britain I'll reside: Nor will I e'er forsake this gen'rous Soil, While Liberty protects her Favourite Isle. O Albion! more than Neighbour-Nations blest, Thy Blessings know, and court thy heav'nly Guest: Let Northern States by Rapine Wealth procure, And stretch o'er injur'd Realms their lawless Pow'r: Let Italy, with Wit, and Arts refin'd, Invent Religions to enslave the Mind; Let the polite, and well-bred Slaves of France, Fine Manners shew, and teach to Dress and Dance; With artful Shifts, and Skill in State Intrigues, Elude their Vows, and break their solemn Leagues. Do thou, Britannia, check encroaching Might, Fair Liberty support, and Civil Right: Dictate to warring Neighbours, Terms of Peace, Just Arbiter by Land, and Soveraign of the Seas. Yet must th' impartial Muse the Britons blame, For various Vices, which obstruct their Fame. Fickle of Mind, and changing as their Skies, What soon they value, they as soon despise. Long the same Way they cannot Ease possess, Nor in one Track, with Pleasure taste Success, Tir'd with the stale, unalter'd Happiness. Ingratitude, of curst infernal Soil The rank Production, thrives in Albion's Isle, Pleas'd with the Glebe prodigious Growth acquires, See, to the Clouds her blacker Head aspires; Whence noxious Dews and blasting Poison drop On Fame's swift Pinions, and her Progress stop. Th' intemp'rate Natives oft their Spirits cheer, With Foreign Wine, or strong Domestick Beer; Till their hot Blood beats high in every Vein, And fiery Fumes intoxicate the Brain; While thro' the Pores, the Vapours Passage find, And cloud the bright Apartments of the Mind, Unbrace the Sinews, and the Senses bind. Hence does a crude and unfermented Mass, Strive thro' the Veins, and thro' the Strainers pass; Which the soft Fibres load, pollute the Skin, Obstruct the Liver, and disturb the Spleen. Hence Dropsy, Jaundice, hence the Limbs remain Unapt for Labour, and for Thought the Brain. While Passions in their Breasts ungovern'd rage, Distract the Mind, and War intestine wage, Reason divine from her high Throne descends, Lays by her Scepter, and her Pow'r suspends. Mean time, transform'd, they various Shapes assume, These rav'ning Bears, and Lyons those become, Some odious Swine, some Goats, and Asses some. Oft Envy, Discord, Avarice, and Pride, With factious Heats, Britannia's Sons divide; Where each believes his Head is fit for Sway, And is more pleas'd to govern, than obey; And while with Zeal they Pow'r and Wealth pursue; And all would Pilots be, and none the Crew, Strife and seditious Tumults they create, Affront Religion, and unhinge the State. Blest Isle! would all thy Sons reputed fit To guide thy State, to any Chief submit; Or had'st thou fewer wise, th' entrusted Hand Rever'd and prais'd, might then the Helm command; Or from a generous Taste of true Renown, Did all thy Greatness seek, and not their own. The End of the Second Book. BOOK III. The Argument. The Causes which produce a great and worthy Race of Men. 1. Laws and Government. 2. Union, and a Course of Virtuous Actions. 3. A due Regard to Religion and Divine Worship. The Errors and Defects which sink and destroy a great and flourishing People. 1. Tyranny: Its fatal Efficacy illustrated in the Case of ancient Greece. 2. Discord. 3. Universal Depravity of Manners. 4. Irreligion and profane Principles. The Conclusion, being an Account of the Rise, Encrease, and Fall of ancient Rome. On this terrestrial various Stage, behold How troubled States are back and forward roll'd; On what frail Props Imperial Greatness leans; While Nature shifts so fast her transient Scenes: Letters and Empire, whose confed'rate Pow'r, Mutual each other's prosp'rous Fate secure, First in the spacious Regions of the East Rose, like the Sun, then wander'd to the West. Assyria's Kings did first the Scepter hold, Which Asia's num'rous Potentates controul'd: Till broke and vanquish'd by the Persian Sword, The Realms around obey'd the Victor Lord. While these prevail'd below, their Sages wise, To Nature's Heights by thoughtful Labour rise, Explore the distant Stars, and triumph in the Skies. Next Pow'r and Arts did Asia's Lands forsake, And their Abode aspiring Grecia make. But thence invited to Hesperia's Soil, For civil Virtues fam'd, and martial Toil, Transfer'd their Seat, while num'rous Nations own'd High Rome their Head, with Pow'r Imperial crown'd; Till gather'd Clans in Northern Climates sprung, Tho' not polite, yet wise, and bold, and strong, Broke Rome's vast Pile, and on her ruin'd Tow'rs Rais'd various Thrones, and independent Pow'rs. Since that, each Potent Monarchy and State Has sunk and flourish'd by alternate Fate; While Realms by Turns in Strength superior grown Enslave free States, or Neighbour Kings dethrone. Now, Muse, the most successful Methods trace That raise, and long uphold a worthy Race, And the Defects which a great Stock debase. As single Men, Strength by Degrees acquire, Sink by Degrees, at length by Age expire: Or else, before opprest with Years they bow, Fall by a sharp Disease, or by a slow. So States and Pow'rs, which subject Nations sway, By Steps grow vig'rous, and by Steps decay: Yet swifter, some compleat their destin'd Course, By Discord worn, or broke by foreign Force. To form a generous Race of Men, 'tis fit They should to some Imperial Head submit: Combin'd in wise Societies should live, And for the common Good industrious strive. For, see, the Tribes thro' swarthy Africk spread, In the wide Indies adverse Regions bred, And in the snowy Climes beneath the Pole, Who rude and barb'rous, and without Controul, Roam o'er the Plain, and in the Forrest rest Not with Improvements, nor with Genius blest, A middle Species seem of blended Man and Beast. Of Government ill Forms we should prefer To Anarchy, and the wild State of Wat: Where Men of no coercive Laws afraid, Each Others Lives and Properties invade. But when these civil Plans are well design'd, And all the Parts in just Proportion joyn'd; Where mingled Powrs each Other's Force controul, Support each Other, and confirm the Whole; Where Liberty and Soveraign Will restrain Mutual Excess, and balanc'd Rights maintain; Men govern'd thus, if blest with temp'rate Skies, Flourish and soon to great Perfection rise. Here see the unexhausted Fountain-Head, Whence all the Streams of Indust'ry are fed! For all assiduous will their Hands employ, Who reap their Fields, and their own Toil enjoy. Shelter'd by Guardian Laws in this mild Seat, From nipping Frosts, fierce Winds, and scorching Heat, From blasting Plagues, and every various Death, Which spreads malignant from the Tyrant's Breath, The liberal Arts, nice tender Plants, appear, Pleas'd with the Soil, and blooming Beauty wear. Customs polite, and fine Address that sooth The fiercest Passions, and rough Nature smooth, From prudent Laws and civil Order flow, While Men ungovern'd, rude and brutal grow. Genius and Wit, which else would lie deprest, Cheer'd with Rewards, and with Applause carest, In well-form'd States exert their Force Divine, And brighter still by Emulation shine. Science refin'd, which Admiration moves, Directs our Instincts, and the Mind improves, Here shines Illustrious, here her Schools display The radiant Stores of intellectual Day. Ev'n Courage, which the Natives Veins inspires, Such artful Force from Discipline acquires, That vast confed'rate Hosts of barb'rous Foes In vain the Progress of their Arms oppose. As Children happy in their Birth, and sprung, By Nature's Care, from Parents hail and young, The noblest Principles of Life obtain, And firm without compounded Druggs remain; Nor owe to Art precarious Health, but late By Time alone deprest, submit to Fate: So Governments by Constitution strong, Design'd and reer'd by skillful Masters, long Maintain athletick Force, and wear away By Steps unheeded, and a slow Decay: While those by artless Heads imagin'd, where Scarcely the huddled Rudiments cohere, Weak from their Infant State will quickly fade, If strife Domestick reigns, or foreign Pow'rs invade. Yet not the Goodness of a civil Frame, Tho' rais'd by Founders of unrival'd Fame, Can make a noble Stock unshaken stand, If Virtue lend not her protecting Hand. See Mercy smiling with immortal Grace, Concord, indulgent Love to Humane Race, And Publick Zeal, impartial, unconfin'd, The Pride and Pleasure of a generous Mind; Justice behold, whose clean unerring Hand, Steddy her equal Balance do's Command; Beneficence, adorn'd with heav'nly Charms, That scatters Blessings from her lib'ral Arms; These Kindred Pow'rs a worthy Race sustain, Without whose Help all Arts, all Schemes are vain. Nor can you hope a generous Breed to reer, Unless Religion's Altars they revere, Whose Rays, more genial than the Sun's, produce Immortal Life, celestial Light diffuse On Man's ennobled Nature, and inspire Exalted Instincts of Divine Desire. This radiant Empress do's within controul Our Train of Thoughts, and guide the secret Soul; Do's with her Nod tumultuous Passions awe, Restrain the Will, and give the Conscience Law. An Empire this, from Humane Reach secure, From Edicts free, and all created Pow'r. Hence prudent Legislators, who design'd To civilize, and cultivate Mankind With Salutary Laws, Religion mixt In all their Schemes, and Modes of Worship fixt. Convinc'd the Atheist has no civil Right, Who to the State no binding Faith can plight, To Death or Exile they the Wretch condemn'd, Who mock'd their Altars, and their Gods blasphem'd. Is there a Nation found, where none adore Celestial Pow'rs, or Aids Divine implore? Who think no causeless Being did create The World, but say it sprung from Chance or Fate? No happy Schemes of Government improve Those barb'rous Tribes, who wild of Nature rove, Lurk in the Caves, or in the Forrest dwell, Like the Brute Rangers, which they scarce excel. Muse, tell the fatal Causes, that debase The noblest People, and their Stock efface. Imperial Pow'r by no fixt Bounds restrain'd, And Will despotick, lawless, and unrein'd, Ill-us'd, will soon the greatest Race destroy, Let them the happiest Soil, and Skies enjoy. Curst Tyranny, which wasted Nations find, The fiercest Fury of th' Infernal Kind, Preys on the Vitals of a State, and drains, To fill her own, th' exhausted People's Veins. The Fiends, her cruel Train, with harpy Feet, Invade their Rooms, and rav'ning snatch their Meat; From crying Infants tear their Daily Bread, And with their Pouncers strike the Parent dead. Their rigid Fate the ruin'd Subjects mourn, Nor can their Thoughts to fruitless Labour turn. Will hardy Merchants range the threatning Main, Thro' various Deaths, impell'd by Thirst of Gain, Who when they 'scape the Storm and faithless Sand, Meet greater Terrors on the cruel Land, And see their Wealth encrease the Tyrant's Power, Whose cruel Jaws, what Tempests spar'd, devour: Will Artisans their Time and Skill employ, If arm'd Invaders must their Pains enjoy? Or Farmers till the Glebe, or dress the Vine, If others reap their Fields, and drink their Wine? And when a Monarch arbitrary rules, Great Masters rare adorn the letter'd Schools: Philosophy, unfed and in disgrace, Conceals her meagre, ignominious Face: The tuneful Genius unrewarded lies Grov'ling beneath, nor dares attempt the Skies: Will constant Fasts support Poetick Fire? Or rapt'rous Ardour famish'd Veins inspire? Of generous Thoughts Oppression is the Grave; Can slighted Virtue flourish? Can the Slave Become industrious, or the Beggar brave? Blest Liberty! 'tis thy distinguish'd Pow'r To heighten Humane Nature, and secure A noble Stock, which, as thy Force prevails, In Vigour thrives, and, as it lessens, fails. Fam'd Greece, when free, with populous Cities crown'd, For her high Merit, Wealth and Strength renown'd, Disdainful view'd the barb'rous World around. Sagacious Genius, Elegant Address, And graceful Manners did the Nation bless: In her full Schools exalted Wisdom sate, And to improve her venerable State, Bright Kindred Arts did on the Empress wait. Letters from these exhaustless Springs did flow, As from Britannia's Cam and Isis now: Hence far and wide her branching Streams did spread, And foreign Schools with borrow'd Science fed. Nor did her Warriors less Applause acquire By their wise Conduct, and their martial Fire; Who brave in Arms proud Persia's Monarch quell'd, From rescu'd Fields th' invading War repell'd, And the bright Throne of Liberty upheld. Greece blest with this great Offspring was rever'd By her own Sons, and by her Neighbours fear'd. But when insulted by the Victor's Sword, And haughty Dictates of a foreign Lord, To take the Yoak she did obedient bow, And Liberty receiv'd the fatal Blow; The hapless Nation, by a swift Decay, Sunk from its Heighth, and base in Ruin lay. The Trav'ller now, who sees thy wasted Lands, And worthless Sons, O Greece! astonish'd stands. And cries, what strange Reverse of Fate is this? Good Heav'n! What Change? I Greece in Grecia miss. Where's the Lyceum? Where the Stoa's Pride? Where the great Sages, who did there preside, And by wise Precepts Humane Nature rais'd? Where the fam'd Bards, who Gods and Heroes prais'd? Shew me thy Plato's, and thy Stagyrites, Thy Pythagorean and Socratick Lights. Would'st thou, O Athens, own this stupid Race? Or Sparta, thou, these as thy Sons embrace? Can it be thought this despicable Brood, From those great Warriors could derive their Blood, Who at ThermopylÃ¦ such Honours won, And triumph'd on the Plains of Marathon? Discord, domestick Strife, immortal Hate, Which with Convulsions rack the suff'ring State, And oft in Arms contending Sides engage, Prove as destructive as the Tyrant's Rage; Deep in the Bowels of a Nation bred, And with black Blood, and noxious Humors fed, The Fury Faction gradual Force acquires, Stretches her hideous Limbs, and trails her speckled Spires: Then tries her Infant-Strength, and first invents Grounds of Distrust, and Jealousy foments, Whispers Detraction, breeds Disgust and Spite, A secret Prelude to her full-grown Might. See, how of Hydra-Race this odious Fiend, While pois'nous Ferments all her Veins distend, Erects her dreadful Crest, and threatning shakes Her Monster Heads, and Twists of hissing Snakes: Expands her cruel Jaws, and fierce exerts Her forked Tongues, and throws malignant Darts. From Town to Town, behold, the Terror flies, With large unfeather'd Wings, and with her Cries And horrid Uproar fills the suff'ring Skies. Th' infernal Guest, where'er she comes, inspires The People's Breasts with fierce Phrenetick Fires. Hence spiteful Envy, and invective Spleen, Open Revenge, or Hate conceal'd within, Passions impatient of the Rein, disown Reason's Dominion, and usurp her Throne. As Seeds of Torment, and contagious Death, Spring from her fatal Aspect; so her Breath Creates outrageous Storms, which rushing shake The strongest Empires, and their Pillars break. Distracted States, if Faction sound th' Alarm, Against their rightful Lords seditious arm: How oft have Nations, which in Strength encreast, Triumph'd in Peace, and Empire long possest, With Discord mad, and with Resentment spur'd, In their own Bowels plung'd th' unnatural Sword? And when to foreign Arms superiour grown, Have Self-Assassins perish'd by their own? See, when the Ship of State distends her Sails, Not with too strong, nor with too feeble Gales, Do's on the Deep of Fear unconscious dance, And o'er the peaceful Waves secure advance, While able Masters at the Helm preside, And guide her safe from Rocks on either Side; See suddain Storms blown up by Discord rise, Embroil the Main, and terrify the Skies! Tempest with Tempest wages furious War, And Clouds o'ercharg'd with inbred Thunder bear A while th' imprison'd Wrath, then bursting rend the Air And while conflicting Winds the Fight maintain, And doubtful claim the Empire of the Main, The suff'ring Ship is this and that way driv'n, Oft sunk to Hell, uplifted oft to Heav'n; Is now insulted by the Tempest's Shocks, And now the Billows dreads, and now the Rocks: Ar length grown leaky, and her Rigging lost, Splits on her own inhospitable Coast. Unhappy States, where raging Discord reigns, And with fierce Flames inspires the Nation's Veins! Where guideless Passions bear superior Sway, And Right and Order Violence obey: Where Factions, urg'd with Jealousy and Pride, Led by designing Heads on either Side, Determin'd, deaf, and obstinate of Mind, Nor by their Country's mournful Cries inclin'd, Furious contend, and while the various Field They often win and loose, and neither yield, They waste their Vigour, languishing decay, And grow to foreign Pow'rs an easy Prey! Conflicting Parties thus subvert the State, Which sad, and yet inevitable Fate In Ruin both united see too late. As struggling Vapours deep in central Caves Imprison'd lie, till by exhaling Waves In Fight engag'd with Subterranean Fire, Their Numbers grow, and mighty Strength acquire; In Spite of Vaults coercive now they heave And urge th' incumbent Rocks, the Mountains cleave With ghastly Chasms, in Ruin lay the Earth, And burst the Caverns, where they had their Birth: Such Mischiefs inbred Discord do's create, So twists, and rends the Bowels of a State. Degenerate Manners, and immoral Life Are no less fatal, than Domestick Strife. As when the Ocean with impetuous Roar, Breaks the high Fences of Batavia's Shore, Sweeps the wide Valley with his spreading Train, And drowns the Hopes and Labour of the Swain; If then a Dome, tho' reer'd with mighty Cost, And greater Skill than Angelo could boast, Obstructs its Way, the Deluge foams and swells, And with its batt'ring Waves the Walls impells; Till the proud Tow'rs, that long unshaken stood, Sink, and with holy Spoils enrich the Flood: So, if enormous Vice with rapid Force Rushes o'er Mounds, and urges on its Course, Disdainful of Restraint, do's far and wide Roll the black Billows of th' Infernal Tide, And o'er insulted Law in Triumph ride; Plung'd in Pollution, and o'erwhelm'd with Guilt, The Fabrick, tho' by artful Masters built, Must fall, nor can the ablest Heads of State Uphold the Structure, or prevent its Fate. Those, who their Wealth and Hours more precious waste In finding Pleasures to regale their Taste, For which they search the Hill, and range the Wood, And of its finn'd Delights defraud the Flood; Who with delicious Wines inflame their Veins, And give to loose Desire the slacken'd Reins; Will find all generous Instincts soon effac'd, Their Nerves enfeebled, and their Minds defac'd. And while their Humane Faculties decline, In Nature's Roll they their high Rank resign, Degrade the Man, and chuse the brutal Line. Dissolv'd in soft Enjoyments, which unbrace The vig'rous Sinew, this degenerate Race Become too weak to bear the pond'rous Shield, And the hard Labours of the Martial Field, They purchase Scenes of Joy at vast Expense, Where, with their Wealth, they dissipate their Sense. Amid'st the Dreggs of Sloth unactive sink, Unapt for Labour, yet averse to think. Such is their busy Idleness, they find No vacant Hour to cultivate the Mind: For liberal Arts appoint no narrow Room, But lazy Life in Indolence consume. When the Diseases of the Mind grow rife, And the Prophane, and dissolute of Life, Diffuse contagious Vice in fatal Sport, O'erspread the People, and infect the Court, In their great Strength the Criminals confide, And mock Tribunals with unpunish'd Pride. Inferior Rulers they with Numbers awe, Rulers, who oft, obnoxious to the Law, With an ill Grace th' Offender must arraign For Faults, which equal their own Manners stain. Will they inflam'd with Wine Excess condemn? Censure vain Oaths, while they themselves blaspheme? Will they th' Adulterer punish, when at once They must his Sentence, and their own pronounce? Hence Vice triumphant reers her hateful Head, And do's her Poison unobstructed spread; While modest Virtue seeks some lonely Place, And friendless walks with melancholy Pace, Veils her sad Looks, and ignominious Face. While these luxuriant Weeds o'erspread the State, And baneful rise to such enormous Height, Base Lust of Gold will wide Dominion gain, Invade all Places, and all Orders stain. Justice, before inflexible, will lean, Her Eyes enlighten'd, and her Hands unclean. At publick Sales Promotions Men will buy, While shining Merit Africk Mines supply: And while such Tribes advanc'd, great Places fill, Of Reason void, Integrity, and Skill, Growing Distempers must the Nation sink, Exhaust her Vigour, and her Spirits drink. Not can a State worse Mischiefs feel, than those Caus'd by her own Domestick, impious Foes. Should Men believe no Self-existent Cause Created Man, nor rules him by his Laws; Of Faith and Truth they would regardless grow, Of solemn Vows no Veneration show. If Right and Wrong, if moral Good and Ill, Are empty Names, Men may pursue their Will, Steal without Fraud, and without Murder kill. Free from a Crime, they may betray their Trust, Nor were it in their Pow'r to be Unjust. Suppose no God; then no Decree divine To ruling Pow'ers, Obedience can enjoyn; And giddy Crowds may guiltless then disown The best of Soveraigns, and usurp his Throne. Nor could the Subject in the Prince confide, By sacred Vows, and solemn Compact ty'd: For not by Oaths restrain'd, with lawless Might, Strip them he may, but can't invade their Right; Since publick Rights on no Foundation stand, If Oaths oblige not by divine Command; Then from her Seat Men Justice may release, Belief and Trust reciprocal must cease; Leagues were in vain by Neighbour Monarchs sign'd, Honour would sink, nor would our Promise bind. Depriv'd of common Faith's cementing Pow'r, What Kingdoms could cohere? what States endure? Where Providence supream the Tribes deny, And fearless dare Almighty Pow'r defy, Law-Fences soon are levell'd all around, And Guardian Virtue flys the hateful Ground; While at the Breach, the num'rous hostile Train Of complicated Woes, free Entrance gain, Which the licentious Pow'r of Vice attend, And sap the State, or by Distraction rend. Muse, to compleat this tuneful Labour, tell How Rome to Empire rose, and how she fell. As yet the Tyber in the Latian Plains, Possess'd by Flocks, and Herds, and peaceful Swains, A pastoral Scene, unconscious of the Bar, The Pomp of Empire, and the Spoils of War, Roll'd to the Main his undistinguish'd Stream, As yet unsung, and scarcely known to Fame; Till, hither guided by auspicious Fate, Wise Romulus erects his recent State, At first obscure; at once the Walls arround, Did his new City, and Dominions bound. While Rome in Embryo, rude and shapeless lay, Wisdom and Law did thro' the Mass convey Such generous Ferments, that the State inspir'd With active Heat, soon Life and Growth acquir'd: Th' heroick Infant did with Vigour move, Stretcht out its mighty Martial Limbs, and strove With Force unusual at an Age so young, Like great Alcides, in his Cradle strong. Still at the Helm, Directors skilful sate, Who steer'd secure the fluctuating State; Form'd with deep Thought, their Maxims, and intent On publick Glory, and their Pow'rs Extent, Just Schemes of lasting Greatness did invent. With ardent Zeal supported Virtue's Cause, Fixt wise Decrees, and salutary Laws: Did guard the Throne of Justice, and command The Reins of Empire with a steddy Hand. Nor did their Wisdom less conspicuous shine, While Temples they ordain'd, and Rites Divine. Now while her Natives Law and Right upheld, And gen'rous Love of Publick Good reveal'd, Patient of Toil, and ignorant of Rest, In Pow'r and Wealth the frugal State encreast. The Realms around, with Envy now behold The growing Roman, virtuous, rich, and bold; And, justly jealous, dread a rising Pow'r, Not fear'd, unheeded, or contemn'd before. The Volscians, Sabines, and the Tuscan Lords, In vain their single, or confed'rate Swords, Against this well-establish'd State employ'd, Whose Strength at first they might have soon destroy'd. Her gen'rous Sons, with Martial Virtue fir'd, Repell'd encroaching Force, and then aspir'd To Fame and Pow'r, which soon her Arms acquir'd. Adult in War, and ripe in Counsel grown, She triumph'd far, and still new Laurels won; Beheld, elated from her lofty Tow'rs, Her Chiefs advance, and fair Hesperia's Pow'rs Before her Ensigns quit th' inglorious Field, And to her Yoke their Necks submissive yield. So brave in Arms, the Roman does advance, Such is his Conduct, such his Vigilance; To Discipline he shews such wise Regard, Studious alike to punish and reward, That in the Stages of his glorious Course, He meets no Task unequal to his Force. In her heroick Virtue's perfect Bloom, Hard and athletick grown by Labour, Rome Intrepid fac'd the blackest Storm of State, And vig'rous, stem'd all Tides of adverse Fate. Is she unprosp'rous, plac'd on Ruin's Brink? Does she distrest, in deep Misfortunes sink? Boyant she'll upward strive, and to her Height Elastick spring, and claim her Virtue's Right. Witness at CannÃ¦ that disastrous Day, Which shook the Props of Rome's Imperial Sway; While Punick Pow'rs, encamp'd beneath her Wall, Promis'd their Lords their Rival's sudden Fall; Beaten, not vanquish'd, with unbroken Mind, See, Rome do's still sufficient Spirit find, To free her Bowels from th' Invader's Sword, And finds her Wounds by strength of Nature cur'd. Nor did their Arms decide these Rivals Fate, But Roman Union Punick Discord beat, And sober Life did Luxury defeat. The Africk Tempest o'er the Alpes retir'd, To more extensive Empire she aspir'd, And still the more oppos'd, more Force acquir'd. As when a Torrent from dissolving Snows Down Alpine Hills abrupt, impetuous flows, If Woods or Rocks withstand its rapid Course, It swells indignant, and with mighty Force, Collected in its Waves, it breaks the Way, O'erturns the Woods, and makes the Rocks obey; Then stronger grows, and with its conqu'ring Tide, Rolls to the Vales the ruin'd Mountain's Pride, And o'er the Plains, does unresisted ride. So RomeâAnd now Hesperia's Regions own Her Soveraign Sway, and Kingdoms yet unknown Revere the potent Nation of the Gown. Had here, O Rome! thy Lust of Empire stay'd, While all Ausonia's Towns thy Will obey'd; If the high Alpine Hills, rough Adria's Waves, And adverse Sea, which fair Hesperia laves, The Bounds which then did thy Dominions screen, Of thy Ambition had the Frontier been; Thou might'st have long surviv'd the fatal Time, Which punish'd, with thy Fall, thy Aim to climb. But now, imperious grown by long Success, She, scornful of Restraint, did forward press; To foreign Kingdoms did her Wrath transfer, And unprovok'd affect ambitious War. See her proud Eagles o'er the Mountains soar, New Seats, new Scenes of Glory to explore! The Seine, the Rhone, the Danube, and the Rhine, Tyber, submit their humble Streams to thine. Numidia's Towns, and Mauritania's Lands, The Yoke receiv'd, and own'd her high Commands. In vain Euphrates, thy opposing Flood, Tygris, in vain, the Victor's Course withstood: Asia's proud Monarchs trembled at her Frowns, While she at Will bestow'd Imperial Crowns, And plac'd precarious Kings on Tributary Thrones. The Spicy Realms, and NabathÃ¦a's Soil, Reward the Roman's Military Toil. Thus stretcht, and rising to uncommon Height, Rome bends beneath her own unweildly Weight. The more she won, the less she grew secure, Weak and disabled by Excess of Pow'r. She did in Bulk, but not in Strength encrease, Hydropick swell'd, augmented by Disease. Their active Force so subtile Spirits loose, Which thro' too great a Mass their Stock diffuse; She her own Armies could not long withstand, Nor the fierce Demons, which she rais'd, command. Thus sunk proud Rome: And what auspicious Fate Can from its Guardian Legions save a State? The hardy Youth too long in Gallia fed, Forgetting Rome, own as their Regal Head The valiant CÃ¦sar, who their Army led. The Rebel Hero, aided by their Swords, Invades Hesperia, drives his lawful Lords, And, with usurp'd Authority enthron'd, Gave gasping Liberty her mortal Wound. 'Tis true, enormous Crimes, and Disregard Of ancient Virtue, for the Change prepar'd; Flagitious Customs, and unpunish'd Vice, Riot, Excess, and sordid Avarice, In every Quarter unobstructed reign'd, Vanquish'd the Victor, and wide Empire gain'd. Now Magistrates let loose the Reins of Law, And powerful Guilt do's weak Tribunals awe; Plung'd in th' impurest Dregs the Nation lies, Wise Precepts break, and sober Rules despise. And as these Manners dissolute prevail'd, The noble Spirit of the People fail'd: Degenerate Life, and Luxury immense, Weaken'd at once their Valour, and their Sense. While at their ancient Discipline they spurn'd, The generous Courage of the Roman turn'd To cruel Rage, and now the bloody Prize And barb'rous Scenes delight the People's Eyes. Oft hence engender'd Discord vig'rous grew, The Fury hence infernal Fewel drew To feed her fatal Torch, which livid flam'd In her Left-Hand, and gath'ring Wrath proclaim'd: While with her Right she brandish'd high in Air, Her threat'ning Fauchion, and commenc'd the War, With mournful Triumphs fills Hesperia's Soil, And urg'd her Warriors to ignoble Toil. But no Commotions did her State invade, Which rag'd so long, or such vast Havock made, As those the Factions rais'd, who firm remain'd To Marius' Cause, or Sylla's Pow'r sustain'd: While fierce in Arms each other they assail'd, By Turns were vanquish'd, and by Turns prevail'd. A crimson Deluge drench'd the Latian Plains, Now from Plebeian, now Patrician Veins. The raving Vulgar, and revengeful Lords With desperate Malice sheath'd their furious Swords Deep in the Bosom of their Parent Rome, Thus did her Glory sink, and Strength consume: Whoe'er with Conquest crown'd from Fight return'd, Rome lost the Battle, and the Triumph mourn'd. Thus Vice, and Discord, and Domestick War With treach'rous Force united, did unbar Her Gates inglorious to the Victor's Car. Now mourn, unhappy State! thy Freedom lost, The god-like Gift, which at so vast a Cost Thy Patriots long preserv'd, whose glorious Aim Was thy Dominion, and Immortal Fame. Henceforth despotick Will thou must obey, For thy mild Senate's Rule in vain wilt pray, And curse in vain the Tyrant's cruel Sway. Mean Time by Steps thy boasted Force will break, Thy Root will wither, and thy Limbs grow weak: And blasted by th' Oppressor's Breath, thy Head Will its rich Fruit, and blooming Honours shed. Some greater Minds, who did the Yoke disdain, At once impatient of the Shame and Pain, Made vig'rous Efforts to prevent their Fate, The Throws and Strugglings of a dying State. 'Tis true the Genius, and heroick Fire, The generous Thoughts which Freedom did inspire, Some Years retain'd their Force, nor greatly fail'd, While those, who born while Liberty prevail'd, Applauded Worthies, trod the Roman Stage, Supported and adorn'd th' Augustan Age. But let us, Rome! thy modern State survey; Where are the Chiefs, who held superior Sway O'er Subject Kings, and made the World obey? Is this soft Tribe dissolv'd in shameful Ease, Is this thy genuine Martial Race? Can these To the great Line of Romulus pretend? From Pompey's Blood, or CÃ¦sar, thine descend? Be wise, O Rome, thy Monuments erase, The Boast of ancient Times, but thy Disgrace: Nor let those proud triumphal Honours stand T' upbraid with Fame extinct, and tell of lost Command. Produce thy Maros, who in lofty Lays Could praise thy Chiefs, if thou had'st Chiefs to praise: Art thou of tuneful Genius quite bereft? Is there no Horace, not a Lucan left? Scarce could one Tasso stretch his feebler Wing In Epick Verse inferiour Acts to sing: For Bards and Heroes both at once expire, Great Deeds alone can feed Poetick Fire. Now can'st thou only on the Mimick-Stage Revive the Glory of some Martial Age; Act ancient Heroes to th' Effeminate Ring, Paint their fam'd Battles, and their Triumphs sing. Should Tully this degenerate Rome behold, So prais'd for Conduct once, in Arms so bold, How would the Patriot blush with Shame, and scorn A Stock so base, in that proud City born, Which once the brightest Virtues did adorn? With sharper Rage he'd this new Nation wound, Than Anthony did sting, and Cataline confound. Look down, great Genius, see thy Tusculum Now made a soft melodious Eunuch's Home. Where thou did'st form thy Philosophick Schemes, And write divinely on immortal Themes, Musicians play, and to the melting Lire Sing wanton Airs, and kindle wild Desire, Unbind the Soul, and false Delights inspire. Look where the Palace of great CÃ¦sar stood, Sloth reigns supine amidst a yawning Brood Of superstitious Monks; and on the Place The Scipios with their Residence did grace, A rich Procurer Virgins Honour sells; Where Cato liv'd severe, a loose Comedian dwells. Such Power have Vice and Discord to debase Th' exalted Genius of a matchless Race And sink a mighty State, tho' long rever'd, With Wisdom fram'd, and by slow Labour reer'd. The END. THE POWER OF PASSIONS Philander, anxious to prevent The Danger ready to ensue, With Reason's whole Militia went His Rebel-Passion to subdue; On this decisive wish'd-for Day, Resolv'd to vanquish, or obey. But when bright Clelia took the Field, And drew her Beauties in array, How did confounded Reason yield, And cast all Arguments away? Against the Power of Clelia's Charms, How weak are Intellectual Arms? Before, he cry'd, I am destroy'd, I'll try if Flight will Conquest gain, By Time and Distance I'll avoid Fresh Wounds, and ease my present Pain. Those, who would Clelia's Strength defy, Must not engage, but bravely fly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART the Second. CONTAINING POEMS Moral and Divine. YOUTH in Danger. TO MENALCAS. When first to Think your active Mind essay'd, And young Ideas in your Fancy play'd, While dawning Reason's unexperienc'd Ray Drew a faint Scetch of Intellectual Day, Your Parents, who the Laws of Heav'n revere, And make Immortal Bliss their pious Care, Assiduous strove by mild Instructive Light To form your pliant Infancy aright. Knowledge Divine they by degrees bestow'd, And with blest Seed your Heart industrious sow'd, Whence verdant Issues soon began to shoot; A Bloom ensu'd, that promis'd generous Fruit. Drawn by their Pray'r, from Heav'n descending Dews Cheer the fair Plant, and Heat Divine infuse: While watchful they destroy'd the springing Weeds, Baneful to Virtue, which our Bosom breeds, Nature's spontaneous Growth, that no Assistant needs. Nor did your disappointed Friends complain Their Hopes were idle, or their Labour vain. Religion thriv'd, with pious Precepts fed, And crown'd with Blossoms rais'd her sacred Head. A Blow of Virtues, all of heav'nly Kind, Mingled their Beauties, and adorn'd your Mind. While Neighbours round unusual Joy exprest, Admir'd the Son, and call'd the Parents blest, Thinking your early Merit must presage Uncommon Blessings to the coming Age. But now the Season rolling on the Tide Of Time arrives, when in the fullest Pride Of Youth, your Virtue must the Test abide; And to excite your Vigilance and Care, The threatning Dangers, which attend you, hear. Now downy Honours grace your manly Chin, And high Spring-Tides with bounding Life begin To smell your Veins, while active Spirits sport, And Nature triumphs in her Vital Court; Now, when unbridled Passions use to reign, While vanquish'd Reason wears the Victor's Chain, See Pleasure, fair and smiling as the Morn, (Soft Silks her Limbs, gay Flow'rs her Head adorn) Which with her Breath perfumes the ambient Air, While sporting Zephyrs heave her golden Hair, Midst her bright Train exerts her conq'ring Charms, And beckning calls you to her open Arms. Millions the beauteous Sorceress destroys With her sweet Poison and bewitching Joys; Bath'd in Delight, their Sinews feeble grow, Lose manly Hardness and dissolving flow. Her fatal Eyes, like Stars malignant, blast Religion's Shoots, and lay her Garden wast; Where Virtue flourish'd in her kindly Bed, Now rank luxuriant Plants their Venom shed, And Broods of Vermin from infernal Seed, Detested Offspring! unmolested breed. At first we play along the flow'ry Brink, View the suspected Stream, and trembling drink: Affronted Reason stings us with Remorse, Suggests the Danger and obstructs our Course: For Nature yet her Modesty retains, Starts to behold her ignominious Stains, And grieves her Beauties are so much defac'd, Her high Descent and Dignity debas'd; But the sweet Bowl's intoxicating Fume Will by degrees our vanquish'd Sense benumb, And o'er the Mind diffuse Egyptian Gloom. Now Nightly Horrors cease to haunt the Head, And we no more familiar Danger dread. Our faithful Censor laid asleep within, We undisturb'd take down full Draughts of Sin. Repeated Prostitutions conquer Shame, Assure the Face, and struggling Reason tame. Tho' Youth untaught in Virtues heav'nly School, Who ne'er rever'd Religion's sacred Rule, Make swift Improvements, and with little Pain, Mature in Vice, an Eminence attain. Should you the Reins to guilty Passions give, And to suppress reluctant Conscience strive, You must maintain a long uncertain Field, By Turns prevail, by Turns inglorious yield. You'd sin and grieve, and by alternate Course Know fleeting Joy, and permanent Remorse. Now you would taste forbidden Fruit, and now Repent your Folly, and renew your Vow: Thus will your Mind a constant Strife sustain, Amus'd with false Delight, or rack'd with real Pain. Should you at length decide the doubtful War, Renounce to Virtue, and for Vice declare, You'll ne'er in Triumph captive Reason lead, On Conscience wholly conquer'd never tread. That dreadful Worm may long enchanted lie, And roll'd in Volumes sleep, but cannot die; Rousing at Times, indignant 'twill exert Immortal Rage, and sting you to the Heart. When Sickness, from intemp'rate Pleasure bred, Confines you trembling to your restless Bed, Where Musick, Wine and Wit would strive in vain, To cool your Fever, and appease your Pain; See, Death approaches with a horrid Pace, Points to the Grave, and stares you in the Face: How will the ghastly Form your Soul affright? How will you start, and shudder at the Sight? And while your conscious Mind shall recollect Past Scenes of Life, and on your Crimes reflect, What Gripes, what Throws, what Torment, what Despair, Will seize your Vitals, and your Bosom tear? While Sense of Guilt not wholly is supprest, Misgiving Thoughts must interrupt your Rest; The hardy Atheist, and the Libertine, Who, Slaves to Vice, ne'er tasted Joys Divine, May pass in Peace their Guilty Hours, which you Who once did Heav'n revere, can never do; Call to your Aid the Arts of Earth and Hell, Th' upbraiding Guest within you'll ne'er expel. I tremble now, to see your Trial near, Distrust your Firmness, and your Danger fear: The mighty Strength of Pleasure do you know, Can you to all her Charms Resistance show, And Victor, triumph o'er this lovely Foe; To all the fair Seducer's Beauty cold, Fly from her Arms, or loose her clasping Hold? Should you presumptuous, quit your safer Ground, And seek the utmost Lines, which Vertue bound, And on the Frontier to engage the Foe, With Reason's weak collected Forces go, You'll soon those nice, ill-guarded Limits pass, Throw down your Arms, and fond her Feet embrace, In her soft Snares her Pris'ner she'll detain, And will you then have Pow'r to break her Chain? Then view the hostile Charmer from afar, And not advance to meet unequal War. Cautious retreat, and fly th' enchanting Sight, You'll only conquer by a Running Fight: Intrepid Courage is destructive here, Where Victors win the Laurels, which they wear, By gen'rous Flight, and wise heroick Fear. The Foe has secret Friends within your Breast, Perfidious Passions, which dissemble Rest; All these, should you approach her Camp too near, Rising in Arms, against you will declare. By this strong Party lurking in your Heart, Reason seduc'd, will to her Side desert. The Fort of Virtue thus will be betray'd, And you, uncautious Youth, a Captive made. If in her Magick Circle you are caught, Not yet benum'd and hard, correct your Fault; Spring from her treach'rous Arms, and swift return, Blush at your Folly, and your Error mourn. Never despairing to the Sorc'ress yield, Tho' wounded, still unconquer'd, keep the Field; With Vows renew'd, and more attentive Care, Against the Foe maintain eternal War. While Pleasure draws her Forces in array, Attentive to invade you ev'ry Way, Your Virtue unexperienc'd and untry'd, A Test of equal Danger must abide, While you on Profit and Promotion bent, Studious contend your Fortune to augment. How will you gain the Favour of the Great, Who Heav'n's Adorers with Derision treat? With scornful Feet divine Religion spurn, Against her Altars all their Battries turn, Far from their Breast detested Vertue drive, And to suppress their conscious Censor strive. See, a strong Faction, sacred Light deny, Plunge deep in Vice, and threaten'd Wrath defy; Watchful to spread th' Infection they reveal To Heav'n Immortal Hate, for Hell an ardent Zeal; By Toleration bold, at Empire aim, And haughty by Success, their Strength proclaim. Those, who their Smiles and Patronage procure, Must take their Test, and pious Creeds abjure. They mock the Good, and only those support, Who by distinguish'd Leudness make their Court. Whate'er to break your Morals they pretend, Stedfast on this unerring Rule depend, They none but Party-Criminals befriend. Should you reluctant Virtue's Cause decline, Studious suppress your Sense of Truths Divine, And bashful with their Ways in part comply, You would in vain to win their Favour try. You from your Breast must root Religion's Weed, Not only sin, but disbelieve your Creed. It must by daring Blasphemy be known, By Principle you're Leud, and all their own. Should you at length from Virtue's Camp desert, To please your Patrons with Religion part, Still a new Convert they'll suspect, and fear You'r Change is feign'd, your Vices unsincere. You by distinguish'd Crimes must Credit win, Fam'd for strange Guilt, and new enormous Sin. You Piety must Superstition name, Exclaim that all Religions are the same; The Prejudice of Education mourn, And laugh your Parents pious Care to scorn. Besides Applause, Esteem and general Love, Another Test will your Religion prove, Reveal you to your self, and faithful show If from celestial Seed your Virtues grow. Your clean, well-manner'd Wit, that flows with Ease, With unaffected Strains must always please. Nor sparing, nor yet lavish of your Store, You never are redundant, never poor: When you should entertain, you ne'er decline The Season, nor impertinently shine. You no Resentment by your Satyre raise, Nor kindle Blushes by your decent Praise, While your surprizing Turns the Audience charm, And all the envious of their Spleen disarm. These shining Parts, this elegant Address, Will gain to Men of highest Rank Access: All to your Conversation will aspire, Applaud your Humour, and your Sense admire, Parties of Pleasure will your Presence court, And Crowds of Flatt'rers to your House resort. While all shall you the Man in Fashon own, The rising Wit and Darling of the Town. When thus admir'd, applauded and carest, Will modest Thoughts possess your humble Breast? Can you such Praises unelated hear? May not this cheering Breath, this soothing Air, Nourish too fast Vain-Glory's secret Root, And make its rank pernicious Branches shoot, Till on your Mind they baneful Blossoms spread, And drop malignant Dews on Virtue's tender Head? While you your Hours amid'st Admirers spend, And scarce to all their Favours can attend, Will not your Mind uncultivated lie, Religion languish, and Devotion die? Without a Will or Leisure to reflect You'll Heav'n forget, and sacred Rules neglect. A sensual Tincture will pervert your Taste Of Things Divine, with Rapture once embrac't. And now the fair Ideas, which possest Your Mind, by loose and vicious Thoughts opprest, How will you wing your Way to Realms above, And feast your Soul with Extasies of Love? Conscious of Guilt, you'll not to Heav'n apply, But dread your Judge, and from his Presence fly. The coming World will cease to be your Care, Formal your Thanks, and cold will be your Pray'r To pure Religion you'll Indifference show, And that Indiff'rence will Aversion grow. Thus you'll proceed, till Heav'n severely kind, By sharp Affliction shall correct your Mind; Gracious arrest you in your headlong Race, And make you Virtue's Cause again embrace; Or angry let you plung'd in guilty Joys, Obdurate perish by your fatal Choice. On FAME. Printed in 1714. By what strong Impulse anxious Mortals strive, That their own Fun'rals they may long survive? Charm'd with its Splendor; all at Glory aim, And ardent climb the tempting Heights of Fame. Behold for this imaginary Good, Intrepid Warriors wade thro' Seas of Blood: Sages for this, with painful Labour spent, Subvert old Systems, and new Schemes invent; Now dive to view the Wonders of the Main, Then range the Meteors, curious to explain The Birth of Storms, and secret Springs of Rain. While others studious 'midst the starry Skies, Explore new Worlds with late invented Eyes; Describe the Empire, which the Sun controuls, And how each Planet round its Centre rouls. The Poets own, their restless Aims aspire To lasting Fame, for this they string the Lyre, Exert their Genius, and exhaust their Fire. And yet their Atomes scatter'd by the Wind Thro' the wide Void, or to the Tomb confin'd, Of all we say, unconscious still remain, They taste no Pleasure, as they feel no Pain. Do's Maro smile, when we extol his Lays? Or Tully listen in his Urn to Praise? Do Shouts of Triumph sooth great CÃ¦sar's Ear? Or Fame, young Ammon, thy cold Ashes cheer? While foolish Men, with vain Ambition try To live in Sound and Names, that never die; Exalted Minds should Toil superior bear, More Hazards run, and warmer Zeal declare, Whose gen'rous Thoughts inspir'd by Virtue aim At Blissful Life, and true Immortal Fame. An ODE to the Supreme Being. I Hail Nature's Lord! from Thee their Source, Brute Matter flows, and Thinking Mind, Blest Center, whose attractive Force, Enlighten'd Souls resistless find. II Mine, while it here an Exile lives, Detain'd in Clay, with Night opprest, Feels she's misplac'd, and upward strives To Thee, and Heav'n its Seat of Rest. III See, as the Hart in Syria's Sand, Gasping with Heat, with Labour spent, Viewing with eager Eyes the Land, Pants for the cooling Element. IV My Soul, great Power, her Way would wing With like Desire, and swifter Speed, To Thee, O unexhausted Spring! Whence living Streams of Joy proceed. V Which cheer the Gardens of the Blest, And all the Heav'nly Walks revive, Which Saints almost with Bliss oprest Do ever Drink, and ever Live. VI Freely the Miser may for me, Amass-vast Heaps of Guinea's Oar, Lord of the Indies let him be, So Thou art Mine, whom I adore. VII With Science let the Scholar's Brain, And pure Ideas overflow, Let him all Nature's Works explain, So I the Lord of Nature know. VIII While of my Wish I am secure, The Soveraign Good at which I aim, I'm blest with Pleasure, Wealth and Pow'r, And envy not the Hero's Fame. THE Safety of a Low State. Printed in 1696. Translated out of Seneca's Agamemnon Chor. Argivarum. The treach'rous Fortune of a Royal Crown, Places whatever's Rich and Great, On a steep and slipp'ry Seat; Whence with an easy Blast all tumbles down. Proud Monarchs can't command soft Peace and Rest, Nor chase uneasy Fears away, They know no safe and happy Day, But painful Cares their Greatness still molest. The Lybian Sea ne'er with such Fury raves, When new collected Hills of Sand Heap'd up by Tempests tott'ring stand, And interrupt the loud impetuous Waves. Euxinus, Neighbour to the Snowy Pole, Where the bright Carman by the Main Untouch'd drives round his shining Wain, Can't with such Force his troubled Waters roll; As when Kings fall, turn'd round by rapid Fate, Kings, whose Desire is to appear Awful to move their Subjects Fear, Which Fear must in themselves the like create. The Night, to hide them safe, do's Darkness want, Soft Sleep, by which a troubled Breast Is sooth'd, and lies dissolv'd in Rest, Can't charm the anxious Cares, that Princes haunt. The Men, who born by too kind Fortune rise, Soon sink and fall down from their Height, Prest by their own unequal Weight, Whom those, who envy'd them, as much despise. Great Fortunes can't their own vast Burden bear, So the swift Ship's expanded Sails, Swol'n out with too indulgent Gales, The Winds, they wish'd before, begin to fear. So a proud Tow'r thrusts his aspiring Head Among the flying Clouds, but finds Th' uneasy Neighbourhood of Winds, And Thunder-Claps, that are around him bred. So the rude Storms that shake the bending Wood, Design an envious, fatal Stroke At the ancient well-spread Oak, The Grove's Defence and Glory, while it stood. High Hills, the fairest Mark for Thunder stand, Great Bodies are but seldom sound, Such have most room to take a Wound, And the fat Deer invites the Huntsman's Hand. What fickle Fortune do's this Day advance, It throws down with a greater Fall; Estates, that are but low and small, Last a long quiet Age secure from Chance. He's only happy, who of meaner Rank, Will ne'er his humble State resent, But always in his Fate content, With a safe Wind sails by the Neighb'ring Bank; Whose wary Boat, that dares not trust the Oar To the rough Usage of the Wind, And the wide Ocean seldom kind, Keeps still in prospect of the safer Shore. Psalm 42. v. 5. Why art Thou cast down, O my Soul, &amp;c. Declare my Soul, why art thou so dismay'd? So much dejected and so much afraid? Why ly'st thou Agonizing in my Breast, O'erspread with Darkness, and with Woe opprest? Hoarce with thy Groans, and delug'd with thy Tears, Still do'st thou feed thy ill-presaging Fears; As fond of Woe indulge thy mournful Strain, Enrage thy Grief, and aggravate thy Pain? Why should'st thou thus in vain afflict the Air, With the sad Accents of thy wild Despair? Fly to thy God, and on his Care depend To ease thy Burden, and thy Life defend; He will dispel thy Fears, revive thy Heart, And for thy Aid Almighty Strength exert. Securely fixt on this Immortal Rock, Thou may'st defy fierce Persecution's Shock, And Earth's and Hell's Confed'rate Malice mock. Psalm 2. v. 12. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, &amp;c. Heav'n will not still th' Obdurate Rebel spare, It suffers long, but will not always bear: Sin grows so pond'rous in its perfect State, Almighty Patience sinks beneath its Weight: Rejected Love do's deadly Hate presage, And Goodness scorn'd proves unrelenting Rage. Rebel repent, and to thy God submit, Cast down thy Self and Weapons at his Feet; To his Imperial Throne due Homage pay, Allegiance swear, and his just Laws obey; Lest when his Kindness to Displeasure turns, And his hot Breast with Indignation burns, He should thy tremb'ling Limbs in Pieces tear, And make thy guilty Soul his Terrors bear, Terrors surpassing all that Man can fear. If thy Delays long-suff'ring Heav'n incense, And injur'd Love should arm Omnipotence Against thy Head, say, whither wilt thou go To scape the just, the sure, the fatal Blow? E'er yet his Fury do's his Arm extend, Sinner reflect, and make thy God thy Friend. An humble contrite Heart his Favour wins, For he will soon repent, if Man begins. Should'st thou beneath his heavy Vengeance fall, Who can deliver, who thy Fate recall? Thou by his dreadful Wrath wilt be consum'd, To Caves of Fire and Pains Immortal doom'd. AN ODE TO JEHOVAH, Creator. I. Hear, O ye Heav'ns, ye Constellations hear, And Thou, attentive Earth, give Ear: Whirlwinds be gone, asleep ye Tempests lie, Nor let ye gloomy Clouds, that float on high, Your Thunder bellow, or your Light'nings fly: And thou, O Ocean, Peace command, Let all thy list'ning Waves erected stand In Chrystal Heaps, as when the splitting Tide Sav'd threaten'd Jacob from Egyptian Pride Be each extended Vale, and rising Hill, As Midnight husht, and as the Desart still, Whil'st I of Seraphs Ã¦mulous, reherse Allmighty Wonders in extatick Verse. II. Hail Independent, Perfect Excellence! Of pure Immortal Light Abyss immense! This and the Orbs around on Thee depend, From Thee they came, in Thee they end. Thou, Lord of Lords, Thou King of Kings, Blest Source, whence all Dominion springs, With Glory art adorn'd, and for Defence, Begirt with dread Omnipotence. Eternal, Mighty, Causeless God! Heav'n is Thy Court, and Bliss is Thy Abode: Nor can Thy Being but unchang'd endure From Thy own Nature's Self-preserving Power, While the vast Worlds, that roll in Air, And all the various Equipage they bear, Unable Beings, are upheld by Thee, And, as Thou pleasest are, or cease to be. III. Above the Regions of Etherial Space, And far extended Frontier of the Skies, Beyond the Outlines of wide Nature's Face; Where Void not yet inclos'd uncultivated lies, Jehovah! Thy Eternal Throne, With unprecarious Brightness ever shone, Rais'd by Skill and Energy Divine, From Thy rich Unfathomable Mine, Whose Womb contains, without Decay, Exhaustless Veins of Light, and glitt'ring Seeds of Day. A Throne, whose Radiance cannot fade, Of uncreated Beams, and Gems immortal made. Pillars of vast interminable Size, Such none but Hands Omnipotent can rear, Which to a Height insuperable rise, This mighty Weight of Glory bear. Pillars of Adamant, Transcendent bright, With blazing Heads of fine Celestial Gold; Inwreath'd in Rays of Spiral Light, Which Saints with dazled Eyes, and slanting View behold. Here Thou, Great King, hast always sate, Awful in blissful Robes of State. Whence Trains, Divine Profusion, all below Of long unmeasurable Glory flow; Compleatly filling every Place, And far outstretching all imaginary Space. IV. Collected in resistless Might, With Majesty's bright Ensigns crown'd, Here did'st Thou Reign, e'er Time began its Flight, Or Orbs set out to run their Round. Nothing, Supreme, Eternal King, Father of Life, of Love, exhaustless Spring, Nothing could e'er Thy happy State molest, Which ne'er grows less, or is encreast. Fixt on Thy Sacred Throne, Thou did'st possess An all-sufficient Plenitude of Bliss; And did'st unnumber'd Ages past employ Whilst Thou, in full Delight, did'st Thy Blest Self enjoy. Till Thou, Thy Goodness to display, Beings of various Order did'st create, To whom Thy Bounty might convey Felicity, and not Thy own abate. V. The unfrequented Provinces of Night, By hostile Motion never yet annoy'd, Not yet discover'd by far trav'lling Light, Profound Tranquility enjoy'd. Thro' the void Regions of diffusive Space, Unfruitful Solitude securely reign'd; No Track appear'd on Desolation's Face, And Silence undisturb'd her peaceful Throne maintain'd. Till Troops of Matter, all unknown before, New-rais'd by high creating Power, Unregimented, raw, undisciplin'd, Receiv'd the great Command to move, And to intestine Feuds inclin'd, Fiercely for Conquest with each other strove. Confusion, Strife, discordant Noise, And horrid Uproar's hateful Voice, Vex the dark Regions of the Deep, Where ancient Night her loneful Court did keep, And where unactive Shade extended lay asleep. VI. Thou Necessary, Self-existent God, With One Divine pacifick Smile, With One Allmighty Nod, Did'st all this fierce Contention reconcile. Obedient to the Word Divine, In friendly Leagues the new Allies combine. To their respective Tasks they all repair, The mighty Fabrick of the World to rear, Of Providence supreme th' intended Theater. The lighter Parts at Thy Command disjoyn'd, Leave the dull Earth and pond'rous Dreggs behind, 'Twas Thou did'st give 'em Wings, and bid 'em rise, Refin'd Materials for the Skies. Aloft th' Etherial Rudiments ascend, Around th' immense Expansion hung; The Spheres their vast Circumference extend, And tune Themselves preluding to their lasting Song. At Thy Command th' unfetter'd Light Emerging from the dark Abyss of Night, At the appointed Rendezvous on high, Muster'd its shining Legions in the Sky: Th' assembled Beams themselves dispose In glorious Ranks as Thou had'st Order giv'n, And with their sep'rate Lines compose All the bright Squadrons of the Host of Heav'n. VII. Thou did'st extend the waving Fields of Air, And dress the Magazines of Meteors there. How do's Thy Chimistry Divine In full Perfection shine Thro' the low Regions of the Atmosphere, Thy vast Elabratory, where Aerial Furnaces Thy curious Works prepare? From Flow'rs and Plants beneath exhaling Steams Persuaded by the Sun's insinuating Beams Forget their Center, and forsake their Place, And mount to fill the Liquid Space: Then by Thy cool Alembicks chill'd, They soon regain their Weight, and are in Drops distill'd, In Drops of healing Virtue, which revive The thirsty Earth, and make faint Nature thrive. The Compositions for Thy Works of Fire Digested here, Maturity acquire; Thunder and Light'ning Thy Arcana, here Concocted ring, or flame around the Air. The hov'ring Snow descends at Thy Command, And spreads its downy Fleeces o'er the Land: Tempestuous Show'rs of rushing Hail, Pour'd from the Crystal Quarries of the Sky, The Earth's unguarded Face assail, And on the Wounds they make, they weeping lie. VIII. Thou, Pow'r Divine and Wisdom to display, The deep Foundations of the Earth did'st lay; The beauteous Structure frame with artful Care, And weigh the pond'rous Mass, and hang the Pile in Air; Th' unshaken Pillars which sustain it, stand Fixt on no Base but Thy upholding Hand. Thou spak'st, th' aspiring Hills appear'd, Their everlasting Heads the Mountains rear'd, The Rocks of vast unmeasur'd Size Obey'd th' impulsive Word, and sprung amid'st the Skies: The humble Vallies now subside, And with their Wealth upbraid the fruitless Mountain's Pride. The starting Streams begin their Race, And with their winding Arms the flow'ry Mead embrace. Now Birds for Flight, their untry'd Wings display, Beat thro' Aerial Waves, and cut the liquid Way. The Flocks adorn'd the Hills, the Herds the Mead. The bellowing Bull advancing at their Head. The Woods with various Beasts were stor'd, Where uncontroul'd their Yellow Lord Slept in his Den, or thro' the Forrest roar'd. The mighty Whale rolls in his weedy Court, While Finny Trains around their Monarch sport More Energy and more amzing Art In Man at last Thou did'st exert, Thy godlike Creature destin'd to command The spacious Empires of the Sea and Land: Thy wide Creation then review'd, Pleas'd with Thy Works, Thou did'st pronounce them good. IX. Then let the num'rous Actors, which appear In all the Scenes of this bright Theater, Rivals conspire to spread thy Fame, And thro' Thy list'ning Worlds, Thy mighty Deeds proclaim. And Thou, my Muse, stretch thy ambitious Wing, Swift from beneath, as Rays reflected, spring, And ravish'd thy Great Author's Praises sing. Ardent exert thy utmost Vigour, strain Thy Vocal Nerves, and spend thy tuneful Vein; Thro' all the Spheres and Orbs that hang around, Thro' frontier Crystal Hills, that Nature bound, Where-e'er thin Air, or Ether are display'd, And far as sounding Accents are convey'd, Fir'd with a sacred, pure, impulsive Flame From blest Religion's Altar's sprung, proclaim Th' Almighty's fruitful Pow'r, and propagate his Fame. CONTEMPT OF THE WORLD. I. When Trav'llers pass from Town to Town, And quit for Foreign Realms their own, To learn new Modes and Laws, and see New Cities and new Company; They visit Courts, and famous Men, Rais'd by the Sword, or by the Pen: And are with curious Sights amus'd, By Nature or by Art produc'd. When Gallia gives no more Delight, Italia sooths their Lust of Sight; Till cloy'd, they next the Towns demand, In Belgia's or Germania's Land: Then tir'd with Show, the weary Wand'rers come To rest in Peace and sweeter Seats at Home. II. So have I roam'd, and so pursu'd New Objects, and new Places view'd: I've tasted all the Pleasures here, They are not lasting, nor sincere. My present Thoughts condemn my past, I've with my Notions chang'd my Taste. To Eat and Drink, Discourse and Play, To Morrow, as we do to Day, This beaten Tract of Life I've trod So long, it grows a tedious Road. I have the World survey'd, and know The Worth of what it can bestow: It can no more new Scenes adorn, The same known Pleasures still return; What can the Coming Time afford me more, Than I have often here enjoy'd before? III. I search in vain, in vain pursue, Some Scene untry'd, some Pleasure new: I'm tir'd with Hearing, tir'd with Sight, Applauses are a past Delight: The Wise and Witty, once my Joy, By Custom now begin to cloy; The Wise prescribe, the Witty rave, These are too Gay, and those too Grave. Who here on Earth would long remain, In fleeting Joys and lasting Pain? Should we not, eager to be gone, Prefer to this the World unknown, Hoping to find in happy Seats above, Exalted Pleasures worthy of our Love? Contemplative Solitude. Printed in 1696. O Fortunati minium bona si sua norint AgricolÃ¦. âVirg. How much the Joys of Solitude excell, The World's rude Mirth and clam'rous Sports, The Noise of Triumphs and of Courts, The Mind, that aims at Heav'n, can only tell. She from the Body, loos'd by ardent Love, Delights in Upper Sky to soar, And mounts thro' Ãther to explore The Scenes of Bliss, and joyn the Blest above; Who, Heirs of Heav'n to Godlike Empire born, Enthron'd, Immortal Scepters bear, Bright Crowns of solid Glory wear, And look on Earthly Pomp with generous Scorn. She sees them lay their Regal Ensigns down, And lowly prostrate lie before Th' Almighty's Throne, whom they adore, And with Extatick Hallelujahs crown. What Raptures inexpressible the Flights Of Heavenly Contemplations raise; The Soul breaks forth in Songs of Praise, And covets These, and only These Delights? Too much dilated for the Breast with Love, And, with her Limbs of Earth opprest, Eager she asks to be releast, To feel more Ease, and find more Room above. She aims and strives to reach the Realms of Light, And chides her Chains and Screen of Clay, And rising Fogs, that take away Her Heav'nly Prospect, and retard her Flight. Safe in Celestial, unmolested Seats, From Clouds and stormy Winds, that blow O'er this tempestuous World below, She mourns as oft as she to Earth retreats. No Fears in those mild Regions vex the Soul, Seated secure, she from on high Beholds the ruddy Lightning fly, And hears beneath the distant Thunder roll. She dwells secure from impious Angels Pow'r, That stray in this low Void of Air, And, watching with unwearied Care, First tempt to Sin, and then their Prey devour. Those Minds become more Excellent and Pure, The more they Heav'ns blest Air frequent, Air free from Damps and noisome Scent; So wholsome Climates Mens sick Bodies cure. When they from Heav'n and Solitude return, Like Saints, like Seraphs they appear, So fresh a Grace their Virtues wear, With such pure Flames of Love their Bosoms burn. This World is still so turbulent and loud, That Heav'n's still Voice can scarce be heard; Angels have oft to Men appear'd, To Men retir'd, but never in a Crowd. In silent Groves the Men of old grew wise, Vot'rys in low Prostration there To the true God address'd their Prayer, There Pagans too ador'd their Deities. To feast her Taste with pure Angelick Food, The Soul does there herself compose, Calmly devout and solemn grows, Aw'd by the Shade, and Stillness of the Wood. The famous Essens, Sages free from Care, Who starv'd their Limbs to feed the Mind, To gain Delight and Joy refin'd, Did solitary Woods to Towns prefer. Their Deeds were harmless, and their Looks untaught, Of the next Silver Stream they drank, Got a cheap Meal from some green Bank, And far from Strife and Clamour liv'd and thought In Fields and Groves unenvy'd Joys I find; I Nature's secret Springs explore, And her Almighty Cause adore, Where Objects solace and instruct my Mind. Like the rich Valley let me fruitful grow, May Hills excite me to aspire, Like them, to Heav'n with rais'd Desire, And may my Thoughts pure, as the Fountain, flow. Like Birds I'll send to Heav'n my grateful Lays, The Sheep shall make me wish I may Be useful, and as meek as They, And hear the Pastor, that directs my Ways. Both Birds and Beasts shall my Distrust condemn, Which ne'er repine, but stray about, Free from all Care and anxious Doubt, And teach me to depend on Heaven, like Them. Motives I ne'er shall want of Love and Praise, For Heaven and Earth will still supply My Thoughts with such Variety, As will new Wonder, fresh Devotion raise. Let me my Mind improve by all I see, And by the Creatures still ascend To the first Cause, whilst I attend To Nature's Volume of Divinity. A Closet or a secret Field with Thee, Shall, Lord, to me be far more dear, Than all the transient Pleasures here, Than all the poison'd Sweets of Ease and Luxury. A Thought of Death. When I with Pain and Sickness strive, And turning This and That Way lie; Convinc'd, I cannot long survive, Yet, not prepar'd, afraid to die; Can I the King of Terrors face, When he approaches near my Bed, With threatning Looks, and awful Pace? Oh! how his Presence shall I dread! While on my Judge I forward look, And back on bold repeated Sin; My shuddring Soul, with Horror struck, Will agonizing thus begin. To the cold Grave when I commit This ruin'd Frame of Lifeless Clay, These dark Terrestrial Regions quit, And wing my Flight in unknown Way, Opprest with Guilt of Crimson Dye, Can I th' Almighty's Sight endure; To whose All-searching, Glorious Eye, The brightest Angels scarce are pure? At His Impartial Judgment-Seat, In what Confusion shall I stand? Can I by Fraud his Pow'r defeat, Or wrest his Vengeance from his Hand? Frown'd from his Throne, and doom'd to dwell In Endless Torment and Despair; What Heart can think, or Tongue can tell The Stings and Anguish I shall bear? Can I my dreadful Doom reclaim, Or Heav'n's Almighty Wrath defy, When pierc'd with Cold, or scorcht with Flame, I ever Live and ever Dye? Can I the fierce Remorse asswage, And Self-avenging Terrors bear, When Conscience, with Immortal Rage, Shall my distracted Bosom tear? These Penal Sufferings to prevent, And gain the Blissful Seats of Day, Let me, with Ashes spread, repent; Nor more the Laws of Sin obey. Why should I hardy forward go In Ways, that Dying I shall blame? Why still repeat the Deeds, I know, I must review with Grief and Shame? The Ejaculation. I Immortal Sun of Righteousness arise, With dawning Radiance bless my eager Eyes: On my benighted Mind Thy Beams display; Kindle, O kindle there Celestial Day. II Bright Source of Blissful Glory, Lord of Light, Chase from my Soul the Horrors of the Night: Remove the dark Eclipse, the Shades dispel, With which, encompass'd round (sad Fate!) I dwell. III Then I Divine Mysterious Things shall learn, Shall Truth from Error, Good from Ill discern; I shall my God, I shall my Saviour know, Whence perfect Joy and Life Eternal flow. An Expostulation with Damon, complaining of his Narrow Fortune. Printed 1696. His Creatures and his Subjects, we should owne Double Allegiance to th' Almighty's Throne Our Place is to revere his Sov'reign Sway, Not to dispute his Will, but to obey. To Heav'n shall our Remonstrances be sent To plead the Justice of their Discontent? For Life and all Possessions, to his Hand That scatters Blessings, we indebted stand. What he is pleas'd to take, you should resign, Nor can complain of Wrong, since nothing's thine What if your Fortune's mean, did not the Best And Wisest, who in Heav'n outshine the rest, Live in this Vale of Tears, despis'd and poor? Some wanted Food and Garments, few had more. And should you quarrel with your Fate, when God Afflicts, but to direct you with his Rod In the known Path, which godlike Men have trod? Toil and Fatigue a Trav'ller best become Amidst his Foes, and far remote from Home. Pilgrims, as we are, while Abroad they stay, Must quit th' Ambition to be rich and gay. This is a strange and hostile Country, where Of Pomp, and Pow'r and Ease we must despair: We only hence a Passage crave to Bliss, And that, whate'er we loose, we cannot miss. No Wants or Woes can make the Virtuous seem Base or inglorious, in their Lord's Esteem; Favour Divine they never can remove, Nor interrupt the Pleasures of his Love; And Happiness to those is yet unknown, Who cannot find it in that Love alone. From Riches free you scape a Thousand Cares, By Distance guarded from destructive Snares. By a low State you kindly are deny'd Th' alluring Baits of Luxury and Pride: And weaker Virtue may be here secure, Which Plenty's strong Assaults might not endure: So little Vessels may in Safety ride On a small River's smooth and peaceful Tide, Where gentler Winds with soft and easy Gales Scarce heave the Bosom of their humble Sails; But if they put to Sea, too late they find Their Strength unequal to a boist'rous Wind, While thro' successive Dangers they are born Split on the Rock, or by the Tempest torn. Thus meaner Stations Virtue most befriend, Giving what's fit, and more would but offend. If now to Heav'n so painful is the Road, What will it be with Wealth's encumbring Load? Do your Endeavours now succeed so well, And all Temptations with such Ease repel, That your Ambition should a harder Task Demand, and vast Herculean Labours ask? That you with Care and Toil should purchase Foes, And seek the Place, which thickest Danger shows: Are those you cannot shun so few and slight, That fond of Ruin you should more invite? This were to ravish Death it self, and scale The Gates of Hell, lest milder Arts should fail. You aim at Heav'n, and will you chuse to stray, And quit the plainest and the safest Way, That you a longer Journey may endure, Thro' Roads more difficult, and less secure? Still narrow Fortunes are the safest found Free from the Nets, which Wealth and Pomp surround: The humble Valley needs but small Defence, We justly dread the rising Eminence, Where Sin and Death their chosen Forces post, And Minds seduc'd are in such Numbers lost. The greatest Hazard that your Fear should move, Is lest the World should too obliging prove; For then she's dangerous, when her smiling Art, And splendid Dress, invite the yielding Heart; But when she frowns, her Charms are lost, unless You Misery pursue, and court Distress. For such Unkindness may abate your Love, And turn your Aims to Happiness above; Make you for high Eternal Joys inquire, And Heav'n pursue with more enflam'd Desire: For still our Wishes after Home and Rest, Are by the Badness of the Way encreast. 'Tis then because we disbelieve or slight The Prize of Virtue, Heav'ns immense Delight, That in an humble State we can't rejoyce, And make nor Wealth, nor Poverty our Choice: That Pomp and Plenty we so little dread, So by the Living prais'd, and curs'd so by the Dead. Assur'd of future Pleasures seek, no more, Ask not soft Persia's Pride, nor Guinea's Oar, So blest complain not that your Fortune's poor. One of such Views possest, may well employ His fleeting Hours in calm Delight and Joy, Who, when a few short Days are past, will know What Raptures from Celestial Triumphs flow, Happy, if those who Heav'n enjoy, are so. Why should you grieve for what you suffer here? All these slight Sorrows soon will disappear, And what is Transient, is below your Fear. AN ODE TO JEHOVAH, Immutable, Merciful and Just. I. Immortal Muse, Essential Truth, display Thy Heav'nly Beams, and whelm me o'er with Day: Give Force proportion'd to my hardy Aim, And kindle in my Veins Celestial Flame, While I approach th' Almighty's blissful Throne, And make in sacred Verse his high Perfections known II. Hail Great I Am! The First and Last, Unchangeably the same. Thou Rock of Ages, Thy Exalted Head, With Clouds and awful Darkness spread, Unshaken by the rolling Floods of Time, Above Duration's Deep ascends sublime. Thy undecaying Vigour ever reigns, And still Thy Arm Almighty Strength retains. Thou liv'st from undermining Years secure, Which this low World with Revolutions fill; No ages can abate thy Pow'r, Nor change the setled Purpose of Thy Will. III. Vain Man, as soon as born, begins to dye, And spends his Vital Stock apace, Swift his successive Minutes fly, Industrious soon compleat their destin'd Race. The Flame it self, which ling'ring Life sustains, Preys on the mould'ring Frame, and burns the wasting Veins. He now an Infant cries, at Manhood now, Does grasp the Huntsman's Spear, or Warrior's Fauchion wave 'Till bow'd with Years, and sunk with Woe, Weary he stretches in the peaceful Grave. His Mind as num'rous Changes undergoes, At various Times, to various Ends inclin'd; By Turns his Tide of Passion ebbs and flows, Impetuous as the Storm, and fickle as the Wind. IV. The deep Foundations of the Hills, And the strong Pillars, which sustain the Isles, Sap'd by Degrees, shall wear and shrink, And let their pond'rous Superstructure sink. The Mountains, which so high in Air ascend, That their broad Shoulders seem to bear the Sky, With Age at last shall stoop and bend, And buried in the Valley lie. The Subterranean Roots of Marble Rocks, Which Winds and Thunder's fiercest Shocks In vain assail, Eat by the surer Teeth of Time shall fail. The Sun may from his Track depart, May stand, or frighted backward start; To spread his Lustre may forget, And now delay to Rise, and now to Set. The Crystal Spheres that roll on high, And seem Corruption to defy, By their own Motion shall decay, And, like a fading Vesture, wear away, The World shall strong Convulsions feel, Sick Orbs shall This and That Way reel. Exhaling Seas their ancient Caves shall leave, And Earth's vast Ribs and Girders cleave: Thro' the wide Chasm, the Sun shall dart his Ray, And to th' astonish'd Center let in Day. Fixt Balls of Light their Station shall decline, And opening Graves their Spoils resign. Fragments of Planets, Sheets of Sky, And Stars abrupt, shall huddled lie, In these last Throws of Nature's Agony. And Time it self, that all Things does devour, Shall perish by its own consuming Pow'r: This mighty Sampson once shall break The Pillars which the World sustain, And of all Nature dreadful Havock make, Then buried in her Ruins shall remain. V. But Thou, Great King! for ever dost endure, From all Corruption free, and from all Change secure. Thy happy Days will never cease, Nor Thy Perfections lessen or encrease. Thou art without Circumference, A Center fixt of Bliss, a Sea immense, Which ne'er from rising Storms Disturbance knows, Nor with successive Tydes retreats and flows. Father of Lights, Thy Self Essential Light, Thy Face unvaried never fades, Thou dost not rise by Day, or set by Night, And never art eclips'd by interposing Shades. Thou can'st not from Thy Purpose start, Nor from Thy steady Rule depart. No watchful Eye in Thee Mutation sees, For as Thy Being, fixt are Thy Decrees. Thou never dost, like fickle Man, repent, Thy Words and Deeds ne'er disagree, And when Thou'rt pleas'd to say, Thou dost relent, The Change is made in Us, and not in Thee. VI. Hail Mild, Indulgent God of Love! To Man what Pity in Thy Bowels strove, When He, who by Thy Goodness was upheld. Won by the great Impostor's Art, Against Thy sacred Throne rebell'd, And took th' Apostate Angel's Part? Thou, by an Irreversible Decree, Did'st not to Endless Death the Race condemn, But that Thy Gracious Nature he might see, Did'st of Redemption lay the Wond'rous Scheme. Divine Compassion such strong Efforts made, And did with such Success perswade, That Thou Thy only Co-Essential Son Did'st from Thy Blissful Bosom give, That all, who His Celestial Message own, Might the Blest Station, which they lost, retrieve. Thou to Thy Uncontested Heir did'st say, Be Thou of all Created Nature Lord; The Subject World Thy Scepter shall obey, And Lost Mankind by Thee shall be restor'd. Proud Princes shall dispute Thy Right in vain, In vain against Thy Throne combine, Defy their empty Threats, for Thou shalt reign, And, with Applause, accomplish my Design. VII. Patient how long dost Thou Delinquents bear? What Blessings undeserv'd confer? Not willing to destroy, but to amend, Thou would'st by gentle Methods Man reduce, Nor does the fatal Blow descend, 'Till Rebels proffer'd Life refuse. Audacious Scoffers, with Infernal Pride, Affront Thy Throne, Thy Government deride, They mock Thy Threats, and formidable Pow'r, Insult Religion, and despise Her Laws, And, by their long Impunity, secure, Provoke Thy Justice to assert Thy Cause: Yet Thy Vindictive Lightnings thro' the Sky, To strike the Wretches dead, refuse to fly. Earth, with a Mother's Pity, does forbear The proud Blasphemer to entomb, Nor does the Pestilential Air, With fatal Plagues, the impious Race consume. They with Thy sleeping Thunder play, And with Almighty Terrors sport, Condemn as Fools those who Thy Laws obey, And, by their Righteous Deeds, Thy Favour court. Because Thou art not Man but God, Thy mighty Patience can sustain so long So heavy and so vast a Load Of Provocations, and repeated Wrong. Thy Heart is tender, and Thy Nature kind; To Acts of Grace, and not of Wrath, inclin'd, Quick to forgive, but to Resentment slow; Thy Vengeance is constrain'd, but willing Mercies flow. VIII. Beautous as Mercy's Self and Bright, Thy spotless Justice ravishes the Sight; Thy Laws are equal, and Thy Ways upright. Thy High Tribunal cannot err, Condemn the Guiltless, nor the Guilty spare. Thou show'st to Deeds distinguishing Regard, The Ill do'st punish, and the Good reward. Partial awhile Thou may'st appear, And to the Righteous Man Displeasure show, But to the Good, tho' oft severe, Thou do'st not Bolts of Thunder throw. Thou do'st Thy Rod, but not Thy Sword employ, Chastise Thou wilt, but not destroy. Long may'st Thou let Oppressors live, And suffer Godless Criminals to thrive; 'Till Guilt to full Perfection grown, Thou cutt'st the ripe Offender down: And then Thy sudden Vengeance shall declare Thou did'st not pardon, but the Stroke defer. IX. Bewilder'd now we can't Thy Ways explore, Nor clear the Justice we adore, In Paths perplex'd she's pleas'd to tread, And wraps in Clouds her venerable Head: But at the last decisive Doom, When Men shall leave the cleaving Tomb, And to Thy High Tribunal come; When Thy Impartial Sentence Thou shalt give, And all shall due Rewards receive; When Godlike Men shall, crown'd with Glory, reign, And Rebels groan beneath Vindictive Pain, Then Justice, then shall Providence Divine, Unveil'd, in perfect Lustre shine: Th' Eternal Scheme of Government display'd, And all Thy secret Counsels open laid, Shall rapt'rous Admiration raise, And grow the Glorious Theme of Everlasting Praise. Matth. V. 29, 30. If thy Right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, &amp;c. I The hardy Deed is done at last, My Criminal Offensive Eye, Pluckt out by Force, I've from me cast; There do's the bleeding Rebel lie. II No more ensnaring Images, Let in by that perfidious Gate, Shall, by Surprize, my Bosom seize, And guilty Passion there create. III Now for my Hand! at one brave Stroke 'Tis gone, I spurn it with Disdain; Its Guilt no more shall Heav'n provoke, No more produce my inward Pain. IV 'Tis better far to enter so Dismember'd into Heav'nly Bliss, Than Healthful and Unmaim'd to go Down to th' Infernal Black Abyss. On Riches. I Allow a Merchant should forsake His Kindred, Friends and Native Soil, And should a willing Exile make His wild Abode some Indian Isle; II Should Hoards of Treasure there pursue, And Wealth above his Wishes find, Which, when he quits the barb'rous Shore, The Fool resolves to leave behind: III That Man is equally of Sense, Of Reason and Reflexion void, Who here amassing Stores immense, In endless Labour is employ'd; IV Which, when he parts with fleeting Life, And quits this World for that unknown, He knows he must, with hopeless Grief, Behind him leave, no more his own. V Good Heav'n! That Trav'llers, who must make So short a Stay upon the Road Of this vain Life, should so mistake Their Journey for their fixt Abode! A Paraphrase on the XCth Psalm, stiled, The Prayer of Moses the Man of God. Tho' we unsettled wearing Life consume Like our Fore-fathers, and without a Home, Vagrants thro' vast and howling Desarts roam; Yet Thy protecting Care Indulgent God, Has been our constant and secure Abode. E'er yet th' aspiring Mountains had their Birth, Or the strong Pillars, which sustain the Earth, Were reer'd, e'er yet the World's extended Frame From the dark Vacant into Being came, Great God, Thou art, and always wer't the same. Destruction is th' inevitable Doom Of short-liv'd Man, who breaking from the Womb, Begins his hasty Journey to the Tomb. When a few Days within its Vital Urn, His Flame of Life has been allow'd to burn, Thou bid'st him, whence he came, to Dust return. The spacious Circle of a Thousand Years, To Thee by Age uncircumscrib'd appears But as a Day that's past with speedy Flight, Or the swift Watches, that divide the Night: Thou Human Kind do'st as a Torrent sweep From Earth, who as the empty Scenes of Sleep, Illusive Dreams and Shades, the Mind amuse, And soon their unsubstantial Figure loose. As the gay Offspring of the Verdant Mead, Man in the Morning blooms, but hangs his Head When Evening comes, decays and with'ring dies, Or by the Scythe cut down in Ruin lies. We in this wasteful Wilderness distrest, And by unnumber'd Plagues and Deaths opprest, By Thy Displeasure are to Sorrow doom'd, And by Thy unrelenting Wrath consum'd. To shew our secret Sins Thou do'st delight, And set our Errors in the strongest Light Before Thy Face; and accurate observe Our Steps, that from the Paths of Virtue swerve. Sunk and opprest by Wrath Divine, behold, We spend our Minutes, like a Tale that's told; Minutes, which with unheeded Swiftness fly, And vanish like a Thought, a Breath, or Sigh. The usual Period of the Age of Men Extends its Bounds to Threescore Years and Ten; And if by Nature, some robust and strong, To Stages much remoter Life prolong, Pinch'd by the Frosts of hoary Age they find Pain in their Limbs, and Sorrow in their Mind; Nor as in blooming Youth, by Steps decay, But fly like Birds of swiftest Wing away. Who form such true Ideas of the Force Of Thy fierce Anger, as with just Remorse, And pious Sense of their own Guilt, to shew Becoming Fear to Thy Displeasure due? Instruct us how to calculate the Train Of our few Days, Days full of Care and Pain, That we attentive may our Thoughts apply To sacred Wisdom, and prepare to die; And with th' Account made ready, free from Fear, And unsurpriz'd, may at Thy Bar appear. How long, Blest Lord, shall we Thy Absence mourn? At length intreated, merciful return To suff'ring Jacob; let Thy Soul relent, Thy Bowels yearn, and of Thy Wrath repent. Lay down Thy Arms, nor as a Foe destroy, That we may taste our Change of Fate with Joy: Soon, e'er with Plagues we wholly are consum'd And to Despair unsufferable doom'd, Dismiss Thy Anger, and Compassion show, That we may Peace possess, and Pleasure know. Let, in Proportion to our Sorrows past, Thy mild Indulgence, and our Comforts last: Nor may our fair delightful Days be less In Number, than were those of our Distress. By their Deliv'rance let Thy Servants find Thy glorious Work, long promis'd and design'd, At last compleated; let the Nations see The Scheme accomplish'd of Thy high Decree: And let of Thy blest Countenance the Light And glorious Presence glad Thy People's Sight; And that our Guilt may not Thy Work obstruct, By Thee directed let us so conduct Our Ways, that Jacob's Crimes excite no more Thy dreadful Wrath, as they have done before. Right ZEAL. Printed in 1696. Behold the Zeal of high Immortal Race, In Whose bright Charms, you may its Lineage trace, Admire this Fervour, and sublime Degree Of Love Divine and generous Piety, Which quickens Minds grown stupid, and imparts An active Ferment to Religious Hearts; Gives to faint Virtue, Force and blooming Grace, And sheds fresh Beauty on her sickly Face. It works not out in Froth, nor will it vent In furious Heats its inward Discontent; For Trifles, never will to Blood contend, Nor all its Warmth in Noise and Censure spend; But meek and peaceful, as the Sacred Dove, Do's on the Soul in gentle Breathings move. It smooths rough Nature, sweetens eager Blood, Expels the vicious Part, and saves the Good. It will its Rise and high Extraction prove, By Charity refin'd, and boundless Love, While it enlarges and extends a Mind To the strait Compass of a Sect confin'd, Till it embraces those of diff'rent Name, And finds ev'n for an Enemy a Flame. With Pity it reduces those that stray, By mild and gentle Methods, to their Way; But makes no Storms of Thunder break on those Whose Errors less Important Truths oppose: Nor do's with Racks or Fire the Stubborn tame, Employing none but its own lambent Flame. If it Reforms, it will some Faults endure, And not enrage the Wounds, it seeks to cure. It pleads for Peace, and strives on Mercy's Side, Controuls fierce Rage, and checks ambitious Pride. By such heroick Energy inspir'd, And by this pure celestial Passion fir'd, Men for Religion's sake and Publick Good, Will shed their own, but not their Neighbour's Blood. This heav'nly Zeal most Heat has always shown For our Great Maker's Honour, not our own: Insults and Wrongs, it can with Patience bear, Provok'd forgive, unask'd th' Offender spare. How sick without it, Piety appears? What lean, what pale consumptive Looks it wears? Its Beauty faded, and its Vigour lost, It seems departed Virtue's Meagre Ghost. This Zeal alone can make it fresh and fair, Restore its Charms, and all its Wounds repair. Such Courage springs from this victorious Grace, As can the various Shapes of Terror face. It makes us lay our Lives with Pleasure down, For Bliss unseen and Triumphs yet unknown, And with Delight perform the various Tasks, Which Heav'n prescribes, and our own Safety asks. This Zeal is wary, not inflam'd with Pride, And walks not but with Knowledge for its Guide. When it grows warm, its Lights are always true; And when 'tis doubtful, 'tis as modest too. Blest Zeal! how pure, how spiritful and clear, Those Souls, that feel its active Pow'r, appear? How much such godlike Heroes us condemn, Whom they excel, as much as Angels them? Psal. XCIV. 19. In the Multitude of my Thoughts within me, &amp;c. I When Hell and Earth their threat'ning Frowns unite, Muster their Terrors, and my Soul affright, When my ill-boding Fears disturb my Rest, And anxious Cares perplex my aking Breast; II When Snares are spread on all the faithless Ground, And Rocks and Shelves encompass me around, When thro' my Veins tempestuous Sorrows roll, Their swelling Tide, and agitate my Soul; III The Thoughts of Thee, indulgent God, dispel These Shades of Death, and change this Face of Hell: From Thee, the Source of Joy, such Comforts flow, As sooth my Suff'rings, and appease my Woe. IV The Thoughts of Thee my wounded Spirit cure, Compose the Tempest, and my Peace restore; The Thoughts of Thee, Great Power, new Life excite, Revive my Hopes, and fill me with Delight. The WISH. I O when shall my glad Soul releast From these uneasy Chains of Clay, To the bright Regions of the Blest Wing with a Lover's Speed her Way? II Where ravish'd with His blissful Sight, I my Redeemer may adore, And in the pure Abodes of Light, May live and love, and sin no more! A HYMN TO THE LIGHT of the WORLD. Printed in the Year 1703. I. Hail radiant Offspring! Emanation bright! Pure effluent Splendor of Eternal Light! Substantial Beam not of Created Race; Th' Effulgent Image of the Father's Face, Who of the blissful Persons hast the second Place! Immortal Life and Love in Thee, And the full Glory of the Godhead dwell, O Co-eternal Majesty! O Source of Goodness inexhaustible! II. Ee'r yet Creation was employ'd To work her Wonders in the Wastful Void: E'er her Incursions she begun The spacious Realms of Night to over-run, Or to secure the Conquer'd Ground Had thrown up Frontier Worlds, and fenc'd her Empire round. E'er Nature out of Chaos sprung, The beauteous Orbs above in Order hung, Or tuneful Spheres essay'd to roll along: Before Young Time his Wings did try, Or Days and Years his active Progeny, Their lasting Breath and Swiftness knew, Or in successive Circles flew: Before the Mountains were brought forth; Or Rocks had Roots, or Hills their Birth; Thou did'st inhabit Boundless Light, A Dwelling like Thy Self, beyond Expression, bright. III. But when from vacant Space Creating Power Had rais'd the Seeds of Things, and Elemental Oar, Dress'd Nature's Magazine and Wealthy Hoard For unform'd future Worlds with crude Materials stor'd, Projected from Thy Face a Vital Ray Thro' Chaos made its radiant Way, And drew the tender Lines of dawning Day: Thy smiling Offspring new-born Light, Freed from the gloomy Chains of Night, Did from the dusky Gulph arise, And spread its shining Wings, ambitious of the Skies. The grey Expansion hovers in the Air, To which new Beams from Prison loos'd repair: Thro' all the Space the bright Infection goes, And chasing ancient Shades away, Do's all young Nature's Charms disclose, And propagate the ripening Day. These pure Emissions of Thy Glorious Face, To Heav'n return their Native Place, Reflected back to Thee, they wing their Flight, Ocean Immense of Independent Light! IV. To Thee their Beams the Constellations owe, Thou on the Stars their Beauty did'st bestow: They, and the Milky Galaxy, Shine by the Rays deriv'd from Thee, Thy Magazines on high, that hold Rich Stores of pure, Ãtherial, liquid Gold, Freely th' Expensive Sun supply, And feed his boundless Prodigality: The vast uncalculated Sums Of Light, which daily he consumes, Thy Treasures, whence they flow, can never waste; Treasures, that, like Thy Self, for ever last. Should'st Thou, the Fountain, stop Thy Glorious Streams, The sick'ning Sun, defrauded of his Beams, Would, with his dusky Orb, the World affright, And yield his Empire to prevailing Night; And thus the Sun, that borrow'd Glory spends, More, than on him the Moon, on Thee depends. V. Are not the Crowns of high Seraphick States, And great Celestial Potentates, Crowns beyond Expression bright, And their wide spreading Robes of spotless Light, Of thicken'd Rays, and labour'd Glory wrought, From Thy Immortal Wardrobe brought? These Seraphs, who Thy Throne surround, And spread, with prostrate Throngs, the Heav'nly Ground; These Eldest Stars, Sons of the Morn, Who sing Thy Praises, and Thy Court adorn, With intercepted Brightness shine, Emitted from Thy Plenitude Divine. On Thee they gaze, and with their eager Eyes Imbibe Unutterable Joys: So long they feed their ravish'd Sight With Beatifick Luxury of Light, They view Thy Radiant Face so long, They feel their Tides of Pleasure run too strong, And with unequal Happiness contest, Strugling with Glory, and with Bliss opprest. VI. Thy Beams irradiate every Mind, Blest Seraphims above, and Men below; Who Truth, by painful Reas'ning, find, Or, like Thy Self, by Intuition know. These owe to Thee their piercing Sight, O Ever-during Spring of Intellectual Light! Arch-Angels of superior Race, Who to Thy Throne possess the nearest Place, In more illustrious Robes of Glory drest, And by their Crowns distinguish'd from the rest: To Thee, the Fountain, owe the purer Rays, Which their inlighten'd Minds to such high Knowledge raise. VII. Thy pow'rful Breath first quicken'd Adam's Frame, Blew up and kindled there the Vital Flame, And Animated Clay a Living Mould became. Then the warm Blood did from its Goal, the Heart, To run its Purple Ring with Vigour start. Then Infant Life began to play, To bound and leap along th' Arterial Way, And carry'd on the circling Tide, Did thro' its winding Labyrinths, and Veiny Mazes, glide. The moving Frame began To breath and speak, and act the Man. His noble Mind Thou form'd'st of Light refin'd, A Thinking Substance of Celestial Kind; A fair and undecaying Flame Pure, like th' Eternal Fountain, whence it came; Which, stampt with Thy blest Image, shone Bright, as the Cherubs, who adorn thy Throne. Thou bad'st the Heav'nly Guest in Flesh abide, And by Thy Skill the Knot of Life was ty'd. Thus Half-Immortal and Half-Mortal He To Angels and to Brutes ally'd, A true Ãquator is design'd by Thee In Halves the wide Creation to divide. VIII. When with Mysterious Links the Heav'n-born Mind Was first with Dust in Vital Union join'd, Thy Offspring was all pure and bright, A spotless Ray of Self-Existent Light, Of thy full Glory an illustrious Beam, A clear and uncorrupted Stream Deriv'd from Thee th' immense Abyss Of Life and Love, and Endless Bliss. Then Upright Man, for Endless Life design'd, With due Devotion did his God adore, In Consort with blest Seraphs joyn'd, Enjoy'd his Goodness, and rever'd his Pow'r. His Breast was fill'd with Heav'nly Joy and Love, Calm and serene, as the Blest Seats above. He neither Sin nor Suff'ring understood, Compleatly blest, because compleatly Good. For Guilt and Ruin are the same, And Bliss and Goodness differ but in Name. IX. But when the great Apostate's Art Seduc'd the wav'ring Creature's Heart, Man from his happy Region fell To the destructive Gulph of Death and Hell; Now Guilt's infernal Gloom, and horrid Night, O'erwhelm his Intellectual Sight, And Clouds, with Vengeance stor'd, his trembling Soul affright. Darkness, like that in Central Caves beneath, Like that, which spreads the lonesome Walks of Death, Where never Ray one Inroad made, The Rebels Mind did swift invade. The Light, which he enjoy'd, abus'd withdrew, And back to Heav'n, its Parent, flew. His Breast of this Celestial Guest bereft, Became a Den of salvage Passions, left Without a Keeper, loose and unconfin'd, Which now no Guide directs, nor Precepts bind. X. Whilst on the Earth such Darkness dwells, Malicious Fiends forsake their hateful Cells, Like rav'ning Wolves, or roaring Lions stray, Hunt and devour by Night their Prey. These Tyrants, as their Empire, did possess This wide, unlightsome Wilderness, And fierce infest th' unhappy Regions, grown In Guilt and Blackness, like their own; Should from the Earth the Sun conceal his Face, What Terrors would invade this dismal Place? Nature and Order would be soon depos'd, And all their Subjects from Obedience loos'd; Which their first Monarch Chaos would restore, And prove the wild Assertors of his Pow'r: Confusion, Misrule, Uproar, Chance, His blind Adherents, would support Their ancient Lord, and swift advance To take their Stations in his lawless Court. Since Guilt did first Admission find, This is the fatal State of Humane Kind. Passions Subjection to their Guide disown, Insult their Soveraign, and subvert his Throne. Fancy does fickle reign in Reason's Seat, And Thy wild Empire, Anarchy, uphold, Hostile Desires fierce Wars repeat, By Turns victorious, and by Turns controul'd: Which e'er prevails the Suff'ring is the same, A Tyrant 'tis, tho' with a milder Name. All that unhappy Man can hope to gain Is various Servitude, and endless Change of Pain. XI. Thou, Kind Redeemer, toucht to see Such Scenes of Woe, such moving Misery, Did'st soon determine to dispell These Shades of Death, and Gloom of Hell. Soon as kind Heavn, of Love th' exhaustless Source, Pronounc'd, that Thy Superior Might Should break th' infernal Serpent's Force, And to benighted Minds restore Celestial Light, Early Thou mad'st Thy blest Essay, And here and there did'st dart a Ray Preluding to maturer Day. In every Age Thou did'st indulgent shew Distinguish'd Kindness to a chosen few; 'Till Thou to Abraham, and his pious Race, More fully did'st reveal the Beauties of thy Face. O Jacob, Thy Auspicious Star, That promis'd Night should soon be chas'd away, Smil'd beauteous in the East, and from afar Did Beams presaging brighter Scenes display. Then were the shining Strokes and Outlines drawn, Then did the Morn of blest Redemption dawn. The Fav'rite Nation was reviv'd with Light, While Pagan Kingdoms lay involv'd in Night; Had scarce a Streak or glimmering Ray, Thro' the dark Maze of Life to guide their doubtful Way: Only some Happy Men, who dwelt Upon the Confines of Thy People, felt A Skirt of that Resplendent Show'r, Which on this Chosen Race Thou did'st abundant pour. XII. At various Seasons, and in sundry Ways, Thou did'st dispense Thy Heav'nly Rays. Sometimes the Form of Man Thou did'st assume, Assuring Thy Incarnate State to come. Thou, who did'st fit enthron'd on High; Above the Convex of the outmost Sky, Whose Robes of Glory, spread abroad, Fill'd all the spacious Heav'ns, Thy blest Abode Thou did'st forsake Thy Blissful Place, To honour with Thy Presence Adam's Race; From Thy sublime Immortal Throne, To Abraham's Tent on Mamre's Plain, In Humane Shape Thou cam'st in private down, Attended but with two of all Thy Heav'nly Train. Thou did'st converse, O condescending Grace! With this blest Fav'rite Face to Face: To Him, as to a Friend, Thou did'st disclose Thy secret Thoughts, and thy Designs propose. When pious Jacob, by Divine Command, Return'd from Laban to his Native Land, Thou met'st the Patriarch on the Road, Who wrestled with, and overcame his God: Crown'd with so great a Victory, Well might he Esau's Force defy; In vain the Pow'rs of Earth and Hell assail The Victor Saint, who does o'er Heav'n prevail. XIII. Often did humble Moses see The bright Eruptions of Thy Majesty: Before that happy Hebrew's Face, Thou mad'st thy glorious Goodness pass. In Sinai's Mount he staid with Thee alone, 'Till with thy dazling Light his Face infected shone. When Joshua first the Land survey'd, Where Jericho's proud Kings the Scepter sway'd, Thou, Warrior like, did'st in his Passage stand, Thy Sword up-lifted in Thy threat'ning Hand: And did'st Thyself the ready Chief declare, To lead Thy People to successful War. The pious General, with due Rev'rence, struck, And, conscious of the sacred Place, Off from his Feet his Sandals took, And worship'd Thee fall'n prostrate on his Face Tho' not the highest Angel of the Lord Did e'er consent to be by Man ador'd. XIV. Sometimes without a Shape in Glory clad, Or wrapt in Robes of awful Darkness made, Thou did'st from Thy Etherial Seat To these low Regions kind retreat. But chiefly with the Mind Thou did'st converse, And to thy People inwardly reherse Thy Purpose, and Thy sacred Will; And, with pure Light, their Understandings fill. From Time to Time Thou did'st those Prophets raise, To guide Thy People, and correct their Ways, Some Lustre still Thou did'st dispense To cherish Thy Inheritance. And on their Minds did'st in a Pillar stay Of Heav'nly Light, to lead the Way Thro' this Pathless Wilderness To Mystick Canaan's Realms of endless Peace and Bliss. XV. Thus Thy Etherial Beams Thou did'st display, The Pledge and Preface of ensuing Day; Which by Degrees o'erspread the East, And, as Thy Rays advanc'd, encreast; 'Till rolling Years had all the Stages run, Set by Divine Decree, e'er Measure first begun: And now the Fulness of the Time was come For Thee our Nature to assume. Then Thou, O Sun of Righteousness, did'st rise Spreading Thy Beams thro' Palestina's Skies. The Prophets, those illustrious Stars, Thy Envoys, Heralds, and bright Harbingers, And all the glitt'ring Beauties of the Morn, That did Judea's Heav'n adorn, No longer now their Beams convey, Sunk in full Glory, and effac'd with Day. Thy gushing Floods of Light o'erpass'd the Mound, And dark Inclosures, that did Israel bound, And overflow'd the Pagan Nations round. Triumphant in its radiant Course It did thro' thickest Shades its Passage force; It made curst Fiends from this Terrestrial Seat, And all the Horrors of the Night retreat. As soon as Thy propitious Star had blest, With its fair Beams the Princes of the East, They left the Sun, and their remote Abode, An Orb of greater Lustre to adore, Such as the World ne'er saw before, Incarnate Glory, and indeed a God. XVI. Hail Prince of Peace! Hail pure embody'd Light! The black uncomfortable Night, That did these wretched Seats molest, By Thy victorious Rays is dispossest. Her dusky Legions routed fly Before Thy shining Forces thro' the Sky, To hide in Caves and Subterranean Cells, Where ancient Shade in Silence dwells, They haste away, and in Despair Yield up to conqu'ring Light the Empire of the Air. Blest Revolution! happy Hour! That did this long expected Day restore: This glorious, this auspicious Day, That with its mild reviving Ray, Cheers desponding Mortals Sight, And back again to Hell sends abdicated Night. XVII. Blest be the Day, be blest the happy Morn, In which th' Eternal Infant God was Born. Let it in all the Pomp of Joy appear, And with its brighter Glory crown the Year. Ye swift-wing'd Hours for ever shew The Rev'rence to your Soveraign due. When it returns, halt for a while to gaze, And bless this Pride of Time, this Chief of Days. Mercy, Compassion, Pleasure, Peace And Plenty, in your gayest Dress, All your celestial Charms display, And here your Annual Homage pay, For is not This your Restoration Day? When Weeks and Years, their circ'ling Eddies done, Shall their appointed Course have run; When aged Time his ebbing Streams shall see Sunk in the stagnant Gulph of vast Eternity, Let that blest Day escape the Fate, Which on vulgar Hours must wait; Let it be rescu'd from the common Doom, And live to Ages still to come: Let it be sav'd, that did Salvation bring, And shew'd Apostate Man his Great Redeemer King. XVIII. When this blest Day returns, be calm the Air, Let the fair Morn her richest Purple wear, And let her spring from the dark Womb of Night, Pure as the smiling first-born Light. Let all her heav'nly Roses spread the Way Before this glorious rising Day. Let it advance, as lovely and serene, As the blest Peace and Joy it brought to Men: And let its Face appear so charming mild, That all the Earth may see kind Heav'n is reconcil'd In all his Splendor let the Sun From his Rooms of State sublime, As an eager Bridegroom run To wed this Day, the fairest Child of Time: Nor let the Sons of Art in Plannets wise With long far-seeing, Astrologic Eyes, Be able now to trace One Spot or Speck in all his radiant Face. Let no outrageous Winds the Seas molest, Let Storms, their Fury sooth'd, in Caverns rest. Let no black Cloud, no sullen Vapour rise, To trouble, or pollute the Skies: Let not a Frown appear Upon one Brow, or on one Face a Tear: Let Grief this Day be silent, let Despair With no sad Accent vex the peaceful Air. Let anxious Care not dare to sigh, nor Pain Presume to groan, nor Anguish to complain. Let nothing but melodious Lays, Triumphant Shouts, and cheerful Sound, No Voice but that of Joy, no Song but Praise, Ring thro' the Earth, and from the Skies rebound. XIX. Let the succeeding Night approach in Peace, Let not the Caves their stormy Guests release. Only, ye Zephyrs, now prepare Your softest Breath to fan the Air: Curle gliding Rivers with a gentle Breeze, With silken Wings pass rusling thro' the Trees, And let no boist'rous Blasts essay To interrupt your inoffensive Play. Let no unwholesome Reeks ascend this Night, No ill-presaging Fires Mankind surprize; May only harmless Meteors take their Flight, And shoot in lambent Flames across the Skies. Let not the Nightly Raven croak, Nor Owls forsake the Hollow Oak; May no fantastick Horrors of the Air, The late benighted Trav'ller scare. Let no wild Beast rush from his secret Hold, To fright the Shepherd, and destroy the Fold; In cavern'd Rocks let no Sea-Monsters yell, Nor Fiends the Earth infest, but rage and howl in Hell. XX. Ye Constellations with your clearest Light, With your whole Store of Beams adorn this happy Night. If any absent Star should not appear This Night to grace the Hemisphere, Cashier'd and broken from the heav'nly Host, Let it in Darkness sink, and be for ever lost. Ye Seraphims who did in Myriads stand Rang'd on the Azure Frontier of the Skies, That all the rolling Worlds below command, And stoop'd and strain'd your eager Eyes To see the Blest Redeemer-God Take up in Flesh his vital kind Abode; Strike your Immortal Harps, and raise Your Voices to exalt his Praise. The ecchoing Spheres with Sacred Anthems fill, Sing lasting Peace on Earth, and sing to Man Goodwill. THE Vanity of Human Life. I What art thou Man? Why all this Pomp and State? Whence can this haughty Mien, these Looks proceed? What can this wond'rous Vanity create, And of thy self this Admiration feed? II High Thought of thy Extraction can'st thou have? Art thou not fram'd of Clay, to Worms ally'd? Rais'd from the Dust, and destin'd to the Grave, The Grave of all thy Joy, and all thy Pride? III Art thou one Moment of thy Life secure? Do's not thy Fate invade thee ev'ry way? Do's not thy Vital Flame it self devour? And will not Age and Aches bring decay? IV What means this Toil? why dost thou Castles build? Why heap up Gold, and stately Houses reer? Why do'st thou carve thy Roof, thy Chambers gild? Do'st thou not know, there's no abiding here? V Thy Life, a transient Vapour set on Fire, A misty Meteor kindled in the Air, Will as the Evening's lambent Flames expire, Or as the Morning Dew soon disappear. VI This World's illusive Scenes of Vanity, Of painted Pageants, and of gaudy Toys, Can lasting Treasure ne'er supply, Nor pure Delight, that never cloys. VII All real Pleasure that we here enjoy, Is on our pious Actions to reflect, Our Lives in Virtue constant to employ, And the Reward of Virtue to expect. Happiness Discover'd. Printed in the Year 1696. With fruitless Toil I've search'd the World to find Pleasures adapted to a Deathless Mind: Honour, Abundance and Delights have spent Their Smiles in vain to give my Breast Content: The Joys they bring, which please a sensual Taste, Dissolve and disappear, when close embrac'd; Never extinguish, but inflame Desire, And add fresh Fuel to a restless Fire. What is a Drop to those, who cry, we burst With feverish Drought, and for a River thirst? My Mind can grasp each India's wealthy Store, And still continue empty as before. For Earthly Pleasures their Intention miss, Ingulph'd and swallow'd in a vast Abyss. When a small Current, or a single Wave, Shall fill the Deep, and crown the ample Cave; When a few Sands of this Terrestrial Mass Shall rise, and spread the whole Etherial Space; Then may the Treasures, which on Earth I find, The Compass fill of my capacious Mind. I have survey'd whate'er the World can shew, All that it promises, but gives to few; And still some lasting Happiness I want, Which these vain Scenes of Life can never grant. Hence, Power supreme, my Thoughts to Thee ascend, The Cause of all Things, and their Guide and End; Thy Goodness inexpressible, immense, And far remov'd above the Reach of Sense, Which is most pure, and will for ever last, Can only please, and satisfy my Taste. I find my Soul is from her Center driv'n, While here misplac'd she strives and aims at Heav'n And is to some superior Good inclin'd, Which she despairs, except in Thee, to find. My Faculties Thy-self can entertain, Thou did'st not make those Faculties in vain. And, as I can, so I aspire to be Happy for ever in enjoying Thee. On Earth of Thy Blest Face a transient Glance, Do's so transport, and so my Mind advance, That I am conscious I could ever rest In Thy full Sight, and be compleatly blest. When I Thy Glorious Attributes admire, And to Thy Presence full of Bliss aspire, I such pure Pleasures, such Delights enjoy, Delights that always grow, and never cloy, That I no more with doubtful Thoughts contend, But rest convinc'd, that for this happy End These Faculties Thou did'st on me bestow, My Will to love Thee, and my Mind to know. How shall my useless Soul its Vigour spend, If not in loving Thee, its Cause and End? If Joys Divine my Breast must never fill, Why have I Godlike Reason? Why a Will? The low Delights of Sense might be enjoy'd, Were I of Choice depriv'd, of Reason void: These Objects in Perfection I might taste, Were I a Salvage, or Domestick Beast. Felicity on Earth I seek in vain, New Disappointments still renew my Pain. The more I grasp, the more my Wants require, Fresh Acquisitions but encrease Desire; My Wishes still unsatisfy'd Return, And make me all my lost Endeavours mourn. Heav'n does to all, but Man, Perfection grant, That, with their Happiness upbraid my Want. No Hopes or Fears unanxious Stones molest, Which in the Earth's Embraces peaceful rest. Trees to their destin'd Size and Stature grow, And no Defect of Fruit or Branches know. Flowers fully blown perfume the ambient Air, And in their Smiles consummate Beauty wear. Beasts that the Forrest range, or feed in Stalls, Blest with Supplies, for which their Nature calls, Pleas'd with themselves, are happy Animals. Above the Field their Wishes never fly, Nor do their Looks erect regard the Sky. No Thoughts of Joys Divine and Bliss immense, Tempt them to scorn the low Delights of Sense; No Views of vast Eternity can show To them how short their Pleasures are below; Nor can they Dangers at a Distance see, But from the Fears of Death and Torment free, They still possess Tranquility and Rest, And are with pure unmix'd Enjoyments blest; While conscious Minds, that high as Heav'n can climb, And look beyond the ebbing Streams of Time, Become unhappy by their Eminence, Their Reason serves but to disturb their Sense. When the sad Mind her solemn Thought employs, And finds she's form'd to taste immortal Joys, And on her high Divine Descent reflects, She scorns this World, and all its Toys rejects. Since then my Native Faculties aspire To Heav'n, and endless Happiness require, To this my Wish right Reason will agree, Would I had never been, or may I always Be! If some refin'd and intellectual Good, Which I demand, and anxious have pursu'd, By persevering Zeal I cannot gain, I all my Soul's Capacities arraign As useless, as impertinent and vain. I hence infer our Author must intend Himself alone Man's Beatifick End. On those pure Minds he'll this Reward bestow, Who mock'd this World, and spurn'd the Pride below. What This denies, the Coming Life will give, Where in Eternal Bliss the Just shall live. A Morning Thought. I How much the Night's refreshing Rest Has lull'd my Thoughts, and eas'd my Breast, Which now becomes a peaceful Scene, Like this fair Morn, these Skies serene? II My Soul impatient of Delay, Thro' Heights Etherial wings her Way, And like the Lark in early Lays, Do's Light's Immortal Fountain praise. III But oh! from this Celestial Seat To Earth reluctant I retreat, Where, while I sojourn, I must bear Affronts and Wrongs, Fatigue and Care. IV Thence rising Vapours Night display, Oppress my Mind and cloud my Day, Spread black Pollution o'er my Soul, While murmuring Tempests inward roll. V Oh! when shall I, from Business free, From Cares and Noxious Company, To the pure Seats above aspire, By Thoughts Divine engrost entire? VI Then shall I still unhinder'd rise, And keep blest Commerce with the Skies; Sill Heav'ns serene and cloudless see Fix'd, Power Supreme, alone on Thee. A HYMN TO THE SACRED SPIRIT. I. Hail Sacred Spirit! Hail Immortal Dove! Essential Purity, Uncomprehended Love! Hail Vigour Emicant! Effulgent Beam! The Uncreated, Co-existent Stream, Proceeding from the Father, and the Word, In a high mysterious Way, That finite Wit can ne'er display; 'Tis not to be unfolded, but ador'd. In Thee, Eternal Love and Grace Divine, The full Perfections of the Godhead shine: Thou art of Goodness an immense Abyss, An ever-during Spring of perfect Joy and Bliss. II. Nature and all her numerous Progeny, Prolifick Spirit, sprung from Thee; The blest Inhabitants above, That People all the Seats of Life and Love, All Things, which these inferior Regions bear, That range the Fields, or in the Ocean feed, That cut the Lakes, or beat the Air, From Thy exhaustless Energy proceed. Did'st Thou not move on the dark Water's Face, And with expanded Wings the Deep embrace, To form the Seeds of Light, and to produce Enlivening Ferments fit for Nature's Use? Thy fruitful Leven, with resistless Might, Diffus'd its Vigour thro' the Plains of Night. Old Shade and Cold were soon depos'd, And Heat and Light were from their Fetters loos'd: All Chaos labour'd with the Genial Strife, And felt the Struglings of prevailing Life. Soon did the crude and formless Mass Put on Distinction, and a charming Face: Soon from the dark Abyss arose, This, and the Worlds around, which the vast Whole compose. III. In the Great Consult Thou did'st joyn To carry on the blest Design Of raising wretched Man from Sin and Hell To the high Station, whence th' Apostate fell. This Project of Inimitable Love Thou did'st from all Eternity approve. Mov'd with Compassion's tender Cries, Mankind to rescue and convert, Thou in the gracious Enterprize Did'st condescend to bear a Glorious Part. IV. The Mind, e'er Guilt had Man undone, With Heav'nly Lustre, like blest Seraphs, shone. Of Fault unconscious and unstain'd In unpolluted Flames of Love, And pure Desires it upwards strove, And full of Peace and Joy the happy Creature reign'd. Since Sin these Regions did invade, What Desolation has the Tyrant made? While Man a willing Slave to Guilt becomes, The World a Scene of murder'd Souls appears, Interr'd in living Sepulchres, And moved from Place to Place in walking Tombs. Sad State of Things, the Human Being's Dead, And the Brute Beast lives in his Shape and Stead. Black Guilt involves the World in horrid Night, And clouds our Intellectual Sight. The Soul is darker than the deepest Cave, Hard as the Rock, and colder than the Grave; Which Hell wants Terrors to affright, And Heav'n sufficient Pleasures to invite. Thou, to fulfil the high Decree, Enroll'd in Heav'n from past Eternity, Did'st undertake the Chosen to inspire, With new enliv'ning Light, and pure Immortal Fire. V. Soon as the Sun of Righteousness appear'd, Emerging from the Shades beneath, And from the Grave his Head in Triumph rear'd, Leading his fetter'd Captives Sin and Death, And then ascended thro' th' Etherial Road To his high Throne, and blest Abode, He on his gracious Purpose bent, His promis'd Blessing Thee, Great Spirit, sent, Of pious Minds to be th' unerring Guide, And stretch his Heav'nly Empire far and wide. VI. These Regions Thy Almighty Fruitfulness With a Celestial Progeny does bless. Seraphs look down from Heav'n to see Th' Effects of Thy diffusive Energy, Transported view th' Immortal Vigour spread, Awak'ning, as it goes, the drousy Dead. Thy Light benighted Minds pervades, Repairs their Ruins, and dispels their Shades, Whence they regain their first exalted State, A Work, as nobly Great, as to Create! And when the Sons of God are thriv'n In this Terrestial Nursery of Heav'n, Thy Colonies Thou kindly dost remove, From these low Seats to people those above. VII. Only the chosen, happy Few, Whom Thou art pleas'd, pure Spirit, to renew, Can aim at Bliss, and warm with Love Divine, The worthless Trifles here, with Scorn, decline. The senseless Many, who possess This World, ah wretched Happiness! Without a Vital Principle within, Benumb'd with Guilt, and stupify'd with Sin, Bereft of Feeling, and of Sight, Have no Perception of Divine Delight: They strive no Heav'nly Pleasure to acquire, For what they cannot taste, they can't desire. When the pale Dead shall in the Grave Demand rich Wines, and Banquets crave; When Beasts, to live with Men, the Forrest quit, And show a Sense of Eloquence and Wit; Then shall th' Impure, unhallow'd Race, Unconscious of Celestial Grace, Feel sacred Transports, and express Relish of Joys Divine, and Endless Happiness. Thy Radiance, which illuminates the Mind, And all bright Virtues of Etherial Kind, They censure, as a Visionary Dream, The Wonders of Thy Grace condemn, Hard and like the Jews, Thy Acts of Power blaspheme. Subjects Divine, which they illusive treat, Are now the Priest's, and now the Statesman's Cheat, Fanatick Cant, and Fancy's feverish Heat. VIII. When Christ had finish'd his Divine Intent, His Labour of unrivall'd Love, And made in Triumph his Ascent, To sit enthron'd in Light above, Dejected, and disconsolate, Th' afflicted Twelve in Counsel sate, And did Thy promis'd Coming wait: Thou, from on high, did'st make a swift Descent, (A rushing Wind before Thee went,) And resting on their Heads in Tongues of Fire, With Fortitude Divine did'st their warm Breasts inspire; Kindly Thou cam'st to strengthen their Belief, Confirm their Courage, and abate their Grief, To clear from Mists their Intellectual Sight, And fill their Minds with Truth and Heav'nly Light. IX. The Saviour King sent Thee his Advocate, To manage here the Int'rests of his State, To plead with Unbelieving Man his Cause, And win him to obey, and love his equal Laws; Full Pow'rs to Thee, his Resident, were giv'n To treat and settle lasting Peace Between the guilty Earth and Heav'n, And Sin's unhappy Captives to release. X. Inmate Divine! Celestial Guest! Who dost inhabit every pious Breast, Vile Man becomes, when purify'd by Grace, Thy Living Temple, and abiding Place. His Heart is made Thy Altar, whence To Heav'n arise pure Flames of holy Fire, It moves by Thy impulsive Influence, And feels the God within, fresh Heat and Life inspire. Minds, destitute of Native Purity, Quicken'd, ennobled and refin'd by Thee, To the blest Seats above aspire, Wing'd with Celestial Love, and strong Desire. They by their striving upward prove Th' attractive Center is above, Thither their Motions they direct, All which the Sun of Righteousness respect: Govern'd by Him they take their Course, Drawn by his Glorious Orb's Magnetic Force. XI. Thou in the Mind the noble Plant dost rear Of Life Divine, and its Immortal Root, With Heav'nly Dews, and Heat indulgent, cheer, 'Till fresh it springs, presaging generous Fruit; 'Till all abroad its Branches spread, And to the distant Regions of the Skies, Is raises swift its verdant Head, And thence all hostile Pow'r defies. Let Persecution now her Ars'nals drain, And for sure Ruin arm'd employ Her vet'ran Deaths, and most experienc'd Pain, Thy blest Production to destroy; Let heavy Tempests groan along the Air, Let Fire and Rain confed'rate Wrath prepare, And must'ring Clouds denounce outrageous War, Thy Offsspring will their rude Assaults sustain, Which on its Head will spend their Rage in vain. Prest with the Storms impetuous Shock, It may from Side to Side incline and rock, But still it shall preserve its Root untorn, Still shall its blooming Head its Parent Heav'n adorn. THE RETIREMENT. If I, of so much Happiness possest, Of bounteous Heav'n might greater Bliss re-request, At a fit Distance from this noisy Town, A small neat Box would all my Wishes crown. To suit my Fancy let the Building stand In a dry Air, upon a rising Land, On whose green Face the Southern Sun displays His warmest Glory and his kindest Rays. A murmuring Brook should at the Foot complain, And sweep the Meadows with its Silver Train. Oft by the Crystal Stream I'd walk and think, Oft sit and write upon the flow'ry Brink. Let on the North a Grove of ancient Oaks, Or lofty Elms from all the furious Strokes Of Snowy Boreas and his stormy Pow'rs Protect my Dwelling, Fruits and springing Flow'rs. I must have Books, Books are my daily Food, But I demand but few, for few are good. I ask the Works of deep and clear Divines, First Tillotson's, by whose Immortal Lines, Britannia's happy Isle inlighten'd shines: Celestial Genius! whose seraphick Pen To Men transforms wild Beasts, to Angels Men. Then of the Poets, I would Milton chuse, Of all, that Albion boasts, the noblest Muse. His hardy Efforts boldly did explore Regions untrodden and unknown before. None e'er had Courage to attempt his Flight, None Strength of Wing to soar to such a Height. Cowley once pleas'd me with his careless Charms, Whose sprightly Vein the Reader often warms. Still I delight in Waller's easy Song, The great Refiner of the English Tongue. He first reform'd th' unpolish'd Poets Faults, Pure in Expression, and as chast in Thoughts. I grieve, I can't in the fam'd Spencer find The Charms, that touch and captivate Mankind. Forgive, great Bard, my undiscerning Taste, My want of Relish can't thy Beauties blast, Lines that have liv'd so long, must ever last. Some good Historians I would likewise chuse, Fit to instruct me, or at least amuse; Where I'd the Actions of the Ancients read, Recal past Ages, and revive the Dead. Travels by Men of Sense and Voyages, Writ with good Judgment, would my Fancy please; Here I should Nature's various Wonders view, And to admire should still find something new. I'd by their Help thro' all the Kingdoms go, Where fertile Nile, or fam'd Euphrates flow; I would their Manners, Arts and Customs know. I would the Rocks and stormy Winds deride, And fearless cut the Deep's impetuous Tide: I'd range the World, and in my Closet roul From East to West, and visit either Pole; Would sail to ev'ry Continent and Isle, And safe at Home enjoy the Trav'ller's Toil. I ask a Friend, whom I might often meet, Of pleasant Conversation and Discreet; Whose Faithfulness is by Experience prov'd, One pleas'd with me, and fit to be belov'd; One who do's ill and mean Designs detest, Of open Hand, but of a secret Breast. A Thought of Repentance. Let down my Cheeks, my melting Heart In trickling Streams incessant flow, Let mournful Looks my Grief declare, And Sighs my deep Contrition show. Let Woe, Confusion, blushing Shame, My Breast inhabit, and express In my sad Face their wildest Shape, While I to Heav'n my Guilt confess. Would my sad Eyes were Springs of Tears, My Head an unexhausted Source Of wat'ry Stores, that moist Supplies Might feed my Sorrow's endless Course. On me, kind Saviour, cast a Look Like that to guilty Peter sent, That touch'd, like his, my Soul may grieve, And yield to weeping Trouble vent. Should not a Wretch with numerous Stains, And Wounds and Sores so overspread, To some unpeopled Desart fly, Or hide in some dark Cave his Head? Should I not leave frequented Towns, The Seats of Mirth, and Sons of Joy, That I my short Remains of Life May penitent in Sighs employ; That I my Actions may review, My Faults and Follies past bewail, And for Remission prost'rate cry To Heav'n, till constant Pray'r prevail? But tho' a bleeding Heart's requir'd, No Grief by Contrite Sinners shown, Without the Merits of the Cross, Th' incens'd Almighty can atone. Saviour to Thee, to Thee I fly, With wrathful Justice intercede; That I Forgiveness may obtain, Thy dying Passion gracious plead. THE CARTONS OF RAPHAEL URBIN, IN THE Gallery at Hampton-Court. Printed in 1703. [Stay, Stranger, here, in this Apartment stand] Stay, Stranger, here, in this Apartment stand, And view the Wonders of great Raphael's Hand; Whose Skill do's all the Sons of Art controul, They only paint the Body, he the Soul. Such Admiration will thy Eyes possess, As none but Raphael's Pencil can express. THE STORY of ANANIAS. See Peter there, who by his fatal Breath At once gave Sentence, and inflicted Death: His Eyes just Zeal and Indignation wear, Such awful Frowns his Face and such an Air, As all to Heav'n's Commissioner allow, While Justice sate vindictive on his Brow. See Ananias there resigns his Breath; How Raphael lives in that Immortal Death! Down the Dissembler fell amid'st the Crowd, As struck with Flashes from an opening Cloud, Or deadly Damps, which Caves beneath prepare, Or suddain Blasts of red malignant Air. Mark how his Eyes resist invading Night, And labour to detain retreating Light; Swimming in Clouds, they seek the doubtful Day, And sinking deep in Shades, Hold eager lay On every glimm'ring Streak and every broken Ray. His Mouth still seems to mutter in the Dust, Some second Falshood, to excuse the first: His quiv'ring Lips of Life th' Appearance wear; But to believe the Hypocrite forbear, For by the Painter's Art they dead deceive, And false, as living, wrong Impressions leave. Observe attentive round th' Apostles spread The thick Assembly seiz'd with shiv'ring Dread, Who look surpriz'd, and at the wond'rous Sight, Seem to start back, and own their great Affright. THE Story of Elymas the Sorcerer. Next to th' Apostle of the Gentiles turn, How do his Eyes with Indignation burn? In his warm Cheeks, what angry Colours glow, What threat'ning Clouds sit gather'd on his Brow? Whilst the Magician with a curst Design, Obstructs the heav'nly Light and Truth Divine, Which Paul on noble Sergius did display, To chase Infernal Pagan Shades away, And o'er his Mind diffuse celestial Day. See to chastise audacious Elymas, Austerely looking on the Sorcerer's Face, He do's his Wonder-working Pow'r assume, And strikes th' Impostor Blind, to strike him Dumb. Thick Darkness on the Necromancer fell, Like that upon his Soul, or that in Hell. Scales made of Mists condens'd and solid Shade, Repel the Beams, which his lost Sight invade; This sable Curtain blunts the keenest Ray, And still unpierc'd reverberates the Day. The Sorcerer's Mien so justly is design'd, His Face conceal'd, his Limbs will shew him blind: With groping Hands to feel his Way he tries, For Hands and Feet are now his only Eyes. There Sergius seiz'd with decent Wonder sits, Such as a great and noble Mind befits. From the Magician's Blindness he receives His Intellectual Sight, and then believes. Thus from the Shade that on the Sorc'rer lies, On the wise Roman, Rays celestial rise. So in Creation, when the Infant Light, To try its golden Wings first took its Flight, The gentle Beams, that did around display The tender Seeds and Rudiments of Day, Sprang smiling from the dark Chaotick Gloom, And broke from ancient Night's reluctant Womb. What Consternation, what Excess of Fear, In all the Figures standing round appear? Their Postures represent their just Surprize, They wonder with their Hands, their Lips and Eyes. Strong Marks of Admiration all betray, All are amaz'd, but in a diff'rent Way. The Cripples at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple. See, Stranger, there the famous Cripples wait At the high Pillars of the Temple Gate, Hoping the Rich, who in that Holy Place Solicit Mercy and Celestial Grace, Who Alms Divine and Heav'nly Gifts receive, Will, in Exchange, some Temp'ral Succours give. Yet to the craving naked Creatures, few Express the Pity to their Sorrow due. No Wight, so very beggarly and poor, Did ever importune a Rich Man's Door. Ne'er in a living Object did we see Such moving Want, such perfect Misery. Pale Cheeks, sunk Eyes, and ghastly Meagerness, Famine, in all its woful State, express. Their Bones, distorted from their Place, begin To start, and break the loathsome wither'd Skin. How slack their Sinews are? their Limbs how lame? How shatter'd all the breathing Engine's Frame? Diseas'd, decrepit, and with Hunger worn, The Wretches make a Figure so forlorn, That all Spectators must Compassion show To such Distress and undissembled Woe. Soon as the great Apostles they espy'd, Aloud for Alms the crawling Cripples cry'd; With fruitless Accents they for Silver pray To these blest Men, who were as Poor as They. Yet they solicit with such earnest Cries, And on th' Apostles fix such eager Eyes, As if they firmly thought, but knew not why, That these kind Strangers would their Wants supply; Which soon they did, not by bestowing Wealth, But a far dearer Blessing, perfect Health; The Apostle only speaks the high Command, And the rejoycing Cripples rise and stand. The Story of St. Peter's Draught of Fish. See Peter at His Feet, whose mighty Word Had the wide Net with Fish portentous stor'd. This wond'rous Piece, with Admiration view, Did ever Face such just Confusion shew? Did Passions e'er in such Perfection reign, Where each for Conquest strives, but strives in vain? Devout Disturbance, Gratitude and Love, A pious Medley, equal Wonder move. From trembling Joints his Spirits upwards rise, And to express th' Apostle's vast Surprize, See his whole eager Soul collected in his Eyes. In Limbs and Face so much he seems alive, That Lookers-on might well this Judgment give, That he has Voice, and ready is to speak, But that Amazement do's his Utt'rance break. Remark the holy Rapture in his Mien, 'Tis in each Vein, and every Muscle seen. Were ever Hands, Compassion to implore, So tenderly devout stretcht out before? If any Force can Heav'n's rais'd Stroke arrest, And from his Arm th' Almighty's Thunder wrest, Or can invade the distant Seats of Bliss With prosp'rous Violence, 'tis such as This. All will pronounce, who here attentive dwell, The Painter's Art, another Miracle. The Story of St. Paul and Barnabas at Lystra. How soon the various Many change their Mind, As Waves unstable, fickle as the Wind? Those they condemn'd as impious just before, As Gods in Humane Shape they now adore. So was the Saviour us'd, one Day the Sky Their loud Hosannahs fill, the next they cry Seize Him, the vile Blasphemer crucify! They call'd th' Apostles Mercury and Jove, Arriv'd on Earth from their blest Seats above; To these suppos'd Celestial Strangers they Honours Divine and Adoration pay. Mark with Attention how the zealous Throng, Inspir'd with wild Devotion, shove along Their Ox, with flow'ry Superstition crown'd, You'll think they shout, and that you hear the Sound. With impious Clamours to the Altar they The Beast, less stupid than themselves, convey. The brawny Priest do's by the Victim stand, His fatal Ax uplifted in his Hand. Observe the sleek and pamper'd Glutton, see His Skin, that shines with holy Luxury. See how th' Apostles, fir'd with Zeal divine, Run in to stop th' Idolatrous Design. What strong Confusion, what a mighty Dread Of undue Worship, in their Looks are read? What great Disorder, how disturb'd an Air, What just Abhorrence do their Faces wear? Their Anger, how unfeign'd? their Trouble, how sincere? None Honour e'er pursu'd with greater Zeal, Than these blest Men, in shunning it, reveal. So high their swelling Tides of Passion rise, Such holy Fury flashes in their Eyes, They so detest the barb'rous Crowd's Intent, And show such Care their Purpose to prevent, That Lookers-on have oft a doubtful Strife, If 'tis the Picture, or the the real Life. One would expect their Lips should Silence break; But, if they can't, their Looks and Gestures speak, By which expressive Language they reveal What inwardly they think, as well as feel. If they had Voice, you would such Accents hear, Mistaken Men, your mad Design forbear; To us your Adoration is not due, We are but Men, as mortal Men, as you. We can of no Divine Extraction boast, We are but breathing Clay, and mould'ring Dust; Weak Flesh and Blood like you, like your's our Frame Is brittle, and our Passions are the same. The Power, by which this Miracle is done, We grant Divine, but know, 'tis not our own. We give, blest Jesus, in Thy Pow'rful Name, Ease to the Sick, and Vigour to the Lame. The Worship, you intend us, we abhor, You must the God, that made the World, adore. If we the Lame restore, and cure the Blind, 'Tis to enlighten, and confirm the Mind. Our mighty Works, that so much Wonder move, Show that we bring our Doctrine from above, And these Credentials our Commission prove. St. Paul Preaching. There does the Humane Seraph preaching stand, Whose very Looks th' attentive Crowd command: Divine Persuasion, with a Heav'nly Grace, Sits on his Lips, and Pity in his Face. No Preacher's Eyes did e'er before reveal Such tender Love, mixt with such ardent Zeal. That Orator must certain be obey'd, Whose Mien is eloquent, whose Hands persuade: To say he speaks, Spectators, do not fear, For if you cannot, sure his People hear, Else how could ev'ry Face such pious Passions wear? With how much Eagerness the list'ning Throng Gaze on his Eyes, and hang upon his Tongue? On 'em, his Words, like Heav'nly Lightning, dart, They leave the Body found, but melt the Heart; And to the Mind the Seeds of Truth convey, Which glow a while, then kindle into Day. Celestial Meekness with such Ardour joyn'd, Mild Gravity, with so much Fire combin'd, The most reluctant Passions must controul, Pierce thro' the Heart, and touch the inmost Soul. The Preacher, with resistless Eloquence, Do's, as the Sun from his bright Orb, dispence O'erflowing Streams of pure Etherial Light, That chases far away Infernal Night. Paul shews such great Concern, such sacred Awe, As if the Heav'nly Majesty he saw, By whose supreme Commission he was sent, To treat with Rebel Man, and bring him to repent. Only that Preacher can th' Affections touch, Who's so in Earnest, and whose Zeal is such. 'Tis plain that Paul his Hearers do's inspire With his own Passions propagated Fire; And while the Speaker, with Seraphic Art, Divine Enchantment sends to ev'ry Heart, He, by his own, do's their Devotion raise, And to their Breasts his very Soul conveys. Then, while with sacred Flames their Bosoms glow, And their soft Hearts begin to melt and flow, He, to compleat his Masterly Design, On 'em imprints fair Images Divine. See, how he triumphs with resistless Skill, How he instructs the Mind, commands the Will. His Breath, like Winds, that on the Ocean blow, Moves all the waving Multitude below, And drives the Tide of Passion to and fro. This mighty Pow'r his Auditors confess, Who such Emotion in their Looks express. Was more sincere Devotion ever known? Did e'er the Soul such painted Passions own? Were e'er her various Shapes to such Advantage shown? Th' Apostle's Words divine Desires produce, And holy Ferments thro' their Breasts diffuse; From Man to Man the blest Contagion flies, They catch it at their Ears, and drink it at their Eyes. Th' obdurate Wretch with Thunder he invades, And with the Terrours of the Lord persuades: And as the hardy Kind his Threats affright, So his mild Arts ingenuous Minds invite. One there inlighten'd, and convinc'd of Sin, Shews in his Eyes, what Pangs he feels within; Fierce Conscience binds him on her dreadful Rack, And stretches all his Heart-strings, 'till they crack. By the Disturbance in his Face appears, What Pains he suffers, and what Wrath he fears. He's so undone, so perfectly distrest, As melts with Pity each Spectator's Breast. That Figure mind, how much it does relent? With fadder Looks, can any Face repent? How just a Trouble, what a pious Grief, Temper'd with Hopes of Mercy and Relief? His melting Eyes, that swim in Tears, declare How deep his Wound, how sharp his Sufferings are. View the next Face, Spectator, thou wilt say Confusion there do's all its Pomp display. Did ever Man so much his Guilt deplore, Detest and hate himself so much before? How that unfeign'd, inimitable Shame, And last Distress, advance great Raphael's Fame? Our SAVIOUR and His Twelve Apostles. There in the blest indulgent Jesus see How Heav'nly Sweetness strives with Majesty; Tho' each in full Perfection is design'd, Yet more conspicuous Passions there we find, Mercy in all her Charms, and Love to Human Kind. See, holy Peter on his bended Knee From his Great Master's Hand receives the Key, That opens wide high Heav'n's immortal Gate To all pure Souls, that for Admission wait, But locks it fast against the impious Train Doom'd to the Seats of Death and endless Pain. Thus the Redeemer did the Saint invest With Pow'r Divine, but not above the rest. For all the sacred Tribe, as well as he, Have Pow'r to bind, and set a Sinner free. Much less this Grant did Sov'raign Right convey, Obliging all th' Apostles to obey Their Monarch Peter's Universal Sway: But do not ask what Raphael's Notions were, His Judgment might, his Pencil cannot err. The PASSAGE. I Now thro' a Desart World I stray Expos'd to rav'ning Beasts a Prey, While I to Heav'nly Canaan beat my Way. II Cast on this wild Terrestrial Isle, 'Mid'st base-born Natives of the Soil, I strive thro' various Deaths with endless Toil. III Passing the Burning Waste along I'm by the fiery Serpent stung, Hurt by his Teeth, or by his pois'nous Tongue. IV Opprest with rig'rous Heat I stand, Viewing with eager Eyes the Land, And for the Fountain, search in vain the Sand. V How much the Springs above I want, I long, I languish, gasp and pant For the blest Streams, which Heav'n alone can grant. VI Let me my ardent Wish obtain, Let me the happy Regions gain, Where Living Waters blissful Life sustain. VII Where Rivers of Delights are spread, And Floods of endless Joys are fed, By unpolluted Pleasure's Fountain Head. The Impertinence of Earthly Things. I What are Possessions, Fame and Pow'r? What all the Splendor of the Great? What Gold, which dazled Eyes adore, And seek with endless Care and Sweat? II Express their Charms, declare their Use, That I their Merit may descry; Tell me what Good they can produce, Or what important Want supply. III If wounded with the Sense of Sin To them for Pardon I should pray, Will they restore my Peace within, And wash my guilty Stains away? IV Can they Celestial Life inspire, Nature with Pow'r Divine renew, With pure and sacred Passions fire My Breast, and loose Desire subdue? V When Age and Sickness Life invade, Should I opprest to them complain, May I depend upon their Aid To sooth my Grief, and ease my Pain? VI When with the Pangs of Death I strive, And yield all Comforts here for lost, Will they support me, will they give Kind Succour, when I need it most? VII When at th' Almighty's awful Bar To hear my Doom I trembling stand, Can they incline the Judge to spare, Or wrest his Vengeance from his Hand? VIII Can they protect me from Despair, From the sad Seats of Death and Hell, Crown me with Bliss, and place me where The Just in Joys immortal dwell? IX Sinner, thy Idols I despise, If these Demands they cannot grant, Why these Delusions should I prize, That can't relieve my only Want? To Devout Christians. I Ye pious Minds of high Celestial Race, Destin'd to Glory and immortal Bliss; Ye Sons of God, by free adopting Grace, And Heirs of Life Eternal after This; II In your peculiar happy Fate rejoyce, Nor let the World's Enjoyments be your Care, Leave them to those, who chuse, ah foolish Choice! Their Portion, all their worthless Portion, here. III Should Princes of the Great Redeemer's Blood, Debase by mean Designs their noble Birth, And condescend to struggle in the Croud For shining Sand, and Bags of yellow Earrh? IV You to divine immense Possessions born, Who aim at Empire, and expect a Throne, These transient Trifles should reject with Scorn, And act like Heroes worthy of a Crown. V You should a just and generous Sense retain Of your high Calling, and expected Joys, And with becoming Pride, and brave Disdain, Should mock the World, and spurn its proffer'd Toys. VI Will you, who own a Taste of Things Divine, And to the Banquets of the Blest aspire, Descend to sordid Pleasures, and with Swine Feed on Pollution, and demand the Mire? SOLOMON's Irony: A Paraphrase on Eccles. XI. 9. Rejoyce, O Young Man, in thy Youth, &amp;c. Printed in 1714. What all-aspiring Mortals have in View, And by a thousand diff'rent Ways pursue, With ardent Zeal, true Happiness discern, And what it is to live, Philander, learn. Let Chiefs, by daring Toils, enjoy their Aim, Their Laurel Gugaws, and their Bubble Fame; Litigious Coifs infest the clam'rous Bar, Prolong Disputes, and thrive by manag'd War; Let hardy Merchants, bent on useless Gain, Patient of Terrors, plough the Liquid Main; Let idle Students on their Volumes pore To cloud with Learning, what was clear before; The Statesman fill with Plots his aking Head, And Misers, 'mid'st Abundance, want their Bread. While these their Hours in various Error waste, Lavish of Time, that spends it self too fast, Do thou, inspir'd with wiser Thoughts, excite Thy Native Fires, and every Sense invite To slake its Thirst with exquisite Delight. Since Future is not, and what Was is gone, And we the Present only call our own, Be thy whole Life, in various Mirth, employ'd, And let no Minute perish unenjoy'd. Now thy young Cheeks fresh rosy Beauty dyes, And darting Spirits sparkle in thy Eyes, While from th' impulsive Heart the sprightly Floud Exploded leaps and bounds along the Road; Piercing thy Sight, and exquisite thy Taste, Thy Joynts all pliant, and thy Sinews brac't; While these fair Hours extend their am'rous Arms, Dance laughing by, and proffer all their Charms, Eager advance, and catch the willing Joy, With Feasts renew'd thy craving Senses cloy. With ravish'd Eyes view Pleasure's smiling Tide, See her rich Banks display their lovely Pride; See, the pure Volumes of her flowing Train, With flow'ry Verdure crown the beauteous Plain; Amid'st the Flood thy self with Transport throw, Dissolve in Pleasure, and in Rapture flow. Be thy soft Limbs with softer Silk carest, Shine in the splendid Labour of the East, By Persia now, and now by India drest. Let Goblets, flowing with the sparkling Juice, Which Gallia's Plains and Tuscan Hills produce, Distend thy Veins, and on the generous Tide Let youthful Joy in circling Triumph ride. To crown thy Table with delicious Food, Rifle the Mountain, ransack every Wood, And cull each finny Pleasure of the Flood. Let thy unrivall'd endless Banquets grac'd With artful Dishes in long Order plac'd, Surprize with new Delight the most luxurious Taste. Ravish'd survey thy Garden's charming Scenes, With Statues proud, and everlasting Greens; The fair, yet unforbidden Fruit behold, Pleasant their Relish, and their Colour Gold; Traverse the beauteous Walks, and free from Care, Regale thy vital Flame with fragrant Air: Now stretcht on Roses in thy Myrtle Bow'rs, Thy Head adorn'd with Wreaths of rival Flow'rs, In constant Transports pass the happy Hours. To Heights superior yet Enjoyment raise, Taste all the various Kinds of Heav'nly Lays, Which tuneful Heads with studious Care compound, Of blended Airs and soft voluptuous Sound. For thy Delight hear Master-Voices sing, Now breathing Tubes, and now the speaking String, While in the Ear attentive Spirits watch, Sieze the sweet Accent, and the Rapture catch. Now with the Men of Wit and Mirth converse, And hear the Bards their am'rous Songs rehearse. Let Beauty now thy eager Passion move, Embrace its Charms, and feast thy Soul with Love: In Pleasures tir'd, with costly Scarlet spread, On downy Pillars rest thy weary Head. How swift the fleeting Minutes wing their Way? Thou'lt die to Morrow, therefore live to Day. When Man dissolves, and mingling floats in Air, His ruin'd Form what Artist can repair? His scatter'd Atomes, and his loose Remains, No Pleasure taste, and feel no torturing Pains. He now in Vapours climbs, now falls in Snows, He's fix'd in Marble, or in Streams he flows, And thro' the various Scenes of changing Matter goes. But know, vain Youth, an ever-during State To this succeeds, and brings a diff'rent Fate. Death but removes the Flame of Life to burn More clear and bright, and in a lasting Urn. When breathless grown, thou wilt not cease to Be, To other Seats transfer'd thou'lt live, and see How Wrath Divine the impious Race destroys, While guiltless Minds imbibe immortal Joys. New Year's Day. I In Annual Spires the circling Sun Has travell'd round th' Etherial Waste, So one Year's Task of Life is done, And one more Stage of Time is past, Whose ebbing Streams apace subside, And in Duration's Deep make haste to loose their Tyde. II The Train of my determin'd Years, With a swift Pinion wing their Way, Daily my Vital Vigour wears, Daily the active Springs decay; The Sun still kindly goes and comes, Kindly unthrifty Time my Stock of Life consumes. III Patience a little longer hold, A while this mortal Burden bear, When a few Moments more are told, All this vain Scene will disappear. Immortal Life will follow this, And Guilt and Grief be chang'd for endless Joy and Bliss. IV Repeat, kind Sun, repeat thy Race; Swiftly, ye Hours, O swiftly fly, Ye ling'ring Minutes mend your Pace, And do not long my Joys deny: Quicken indulgent Time thy Flight, And bear me on thy Wings to the blest Coasts of Light. AN ODE TO THE DIVINE BEING. I Hail all Perfection, Source of Bliss! Hail Self-existent Cause of Things, Essential Goodness, bright Abyss, Whence Beatifick Glory springs! II Blest Object of my Love intense I Thee my Joy, my Treasure call, My Portion, my Reward immense, Soul of my Soul, my Life, my All. III Freely the Pomps and Triumphs here, Illusive Phantomes, I resign, Princes unenvy'd you may share The canton'd World, while Heav'n is mine. IV You, who Delights and Pleasures court, For me may all your Senses cloy, You may unrivall'd Dance and Sport, While my blest Author I enjoy. V Have all the spacious Heav'ns around, With him an Object to compare, On Earth is any Pleasure found, Which to his Favour I prefer? VI When Cares invade on every Side, And restless Passions urge my Soul; When gloomy Grief its pond'rous Tide, Do's thro' my aking Bosom roll; VII Fountain of Glory, Lord of Light, From thy bright Face, one darted Ray, Will calm the Storm, dispel the Night, And re-establish banish'd Day.
