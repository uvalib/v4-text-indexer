      <field name="fulltext">Anniversaries upon his Panarete, continued. The second Yeeres Annivers. Last yeare I wrote of my deare Panaret, To pay my dearest Deare her duest debt; But who is Hee knew her and knoweth not How many things I in my Threnes forgot, Which should have been exprest? but such as wee Who share in griefes, fall short in memorie. This to supply with teare-distilling eye, Still to one Taske I must my selfe apply; For wee an Anniversall meane to reare In honour of her vertues ev'ry yeare: Where though our Pencyle cannot well set forth The riches of her goodnesse and true worth, It shall appeare wee have desire to doe it, By th' ceremonious zeale wee beare unto it. ? lachrymis? revisimus umbras. First, in my weekely visit to her shrine, I bathe those corps with teares which once were mine, Once mine, now Earths: Nor doe I, trust me, stay In any superstitious sort to pray For her reposed Soule, which being at rest, My Prayer would seeme superfluous at best: Yea, I should injure her, whose boundlesse blisse Is such, none can be happier then shee is. Yet give me leave to eye her scatt'red dust, Which in the resurrection of the just Shall bee united to her better part, And re-united never to depart One from another, but must joyntly share In those choise comforts which eternall are. O Earth, Earth, Earth! O triple style of man Earth, for from Earth his first beginning came; Earth affection too, because, heav'ns know, What we should hate, wee're most affected to; Earth by his dissolution, since hee must Returne from whence he came, his mother dust. Deare Dust! whose smallest atoms shall not be Strain'd through the Crevet of my memorie Without religious reverence! I will give These pretious graines for reliques while I live To such as honour her, whose vertuous fame Before all Monuments, preserves her name. In my diurnall sorrowes, I doe muse Discoursing, as I many times doe use, Et lachrymasse juvat.—Of this unequall'd Subject, those that heare My Scenes of griefe, should not afford a teare To ev'ry accent: ev'ry trifling toy Sprung from the ashes of consumed Troy Can force distreaming passion, though this woe, This feined woe, were many yeares agoe: Yet in that great destruction shew me one, Whose losse might really exact our mone By her exemplar vertues, as this did, Or ever strove to have her worth more hid. Some were held faire, but they were vicious; Others deform'd, though they were vertuous: Scarce one of that pure temper should we finde, Where beauty vy'de with graces of the minde: But Mine was faire and good, chaste, choice and free In all, save what she had ingag'd to mee; A sacred-secret gage, which I still keepe. In lieu of Her, who now is falne asleepe. A Modell of her feature yet I have, Et meminisse juvat. Which I will carry with me to my Grave, And this in private am I wont to eye, And view't from top to toe, then set it by, Then take it up againe to feed my sight, Which cheeres, but cannot cloy mine appetite. Sometimes opinion does delude conceite, And makes me thinke Shee h'as dispenc'd with fate, While sweet stolne blushes from her Cheekes appeares Mixt with th' Elixer of pure Amber teares, Which with a carefull hand I wipe the while, And she requires me with a winning smile. But what are these, but fancies that are bred From the distempers of a troubled head? Heav'ns blesse me! now, how melancholly seeme Those shady walkes, and that Olympick Greene Where nimble youths their exercises did, And yeerely for her sake solemnized? With what enwreathings would my Love and I T'encourage young endevours there stand by, While with a modest smile Shee'd deigne to grace The blest Spectators of that happy place? Blest by her presence! for I freely vow, Nought but was gracefull what shee deign'd to doe. Oft have I seene her from her Dayry come Attended by her Maids, and hasting home To entertaine some Guests of quality, Shee would assume a State so modestly Sance affectation, as she struck the eye With admiration of the Stander by: That Hee who saw her from the Dayry passe Would scarce beleeve her for the same Shee was. So well Shee could upon the selfe-same day Both Civile Courtier and the House-wife play. But to survey the passage of her life, With Offices belonging to a wife, A modest Matron, and a Courtly Bride, Dispencer of a Family beside, Heare but a little what I shall relate; And you may finde one fit to imitate In th' posture of all goodnesse! which may give Example unto others how to live. Draw hither then, ye Formalists of th' age, Who make your life a Progresse to a Stage, Your Chambers Tyring-houses, where to pray Were such a tedious taske, as you delay To take acquaintance of it; or decline Your thoughts from heav'n, because you have no time For such reserved vowes: no more you have, Nor can you dainty-Ducks a moment save. For all your pretious Morning-houres are given For you to paint and decke you till eleven; And then an houre or two must be the least To jeere your foolish Lover, or to feast, Or court your amorous ?b?ringing Favorite With a bare-bathed breast to feed delight, And purchase more Spectators:—but time's lost Till a Play-bill be sever'd from the Post T'informe you what's to play; then comes your Coach, Where numerous light-ones, like your selfe approach. But where's Devotion all this while? asleepe, And for her selfe sole-Centinall may keepe, But now you'r seated, and the Musick sound For th' Actors entry; pleasures doe abound In ev'ry Boxe; sometimes your eye's on th' Stage, Streight on a lighter Object, your loose Page, Or some phantastike Gallant, or your Groome, But when this Embleme of your life is done, This piece of witty art, what doe you then? To your sinne-shrouding Coaches streight againe You make repaire, where you relaters bee Of what your Eare did heare, or Eye could see. Then to a luscious Supper, after this To a reere banket, or to some quaint dish To move a sensuall slumber, and delight But never sate your boundlesse appetite. Thus you in painted joyes mis-spend your dayes More to your Suiters than your Makers praise. But thinke not, Faire Ones, that I am too bitter, For I doe hold no Recreation fitter Than Morall Enterludes; but have a care You doe not make them too familiar; For that were to invert a Recreation, And by day-practice make it a Vocation: Though Some have writ that I doe hate a Scene, Their judgements erre, nor know they what I meane; I'm no Stage-Stinger, nor will ever be, But doe preferre a pleasant Comedie Before a Taverne, where so many sit To drench downe care without a drop of wit. But see th' effect of griefe! how glad would I To any forc'd Digression rather fly Than to our teare-swolne Subject, where reliefe Hath made it selfe a Stranger to our griefe? But now I haste to thee, my Dearest Deare, To shew what precious treasures stored were In thy religious bosome: nor shall love Cause me speake more than I can duely prove. Education of her Children. First, for her nursing care; Shee held no state Fitter for Mothers than to educate Those they brought forth, and make their life a line To teach their children how to spend their time. And this shee did; for ev'n her Nurserie Appear'd a private Schoole of industrie, Where th' Elder taught and taskt the younger sort, As th' Mother taught the Elder; none fell short In their Endevours: but if so they did, They were by Her so sweetly chastized, (And rare is such discretion to be knowne) Both Love and awe were foulded in her frowne, Yea, such a lovely reverence did attend her, They'd rather be corrected than offend her. But no delitious fare could she endure Her Children to be us'd to, but inure Their youth to timely Moderation now T' enable them when they should riper grow. For she was wont to say, “When God shall call “On us, Heav'n knows in whose hands they may fall. “Let's then so breed them as may best become them, “And to endure whats'ere may fall upon them. With wholesome temperate dyet shee'd supply The luscious fruits of Mothers vanity. Observe this, Mothers, for 'tis unto you I speake, who so much delicacy shew To your too tender off-spring, and like th' Ape, Annoy them most of whom you most doe make. Where be these native Arguments of love Which you expresse? Or, wherein doe you prove Your selves true Mothers? none can gather this From pleasing of your Younglings with a kisse, Or indiscreetest dandling on your knee, Or cockring them with your indulgencie, That you are naturall Mothers, unlesse wee By naturall meane foolish; so't may bee You may be tender Ones, I'l not deny, Who, when they put their finger in the eye For such a forraine Fashion, or a Feather, Rather than grieve them you'l deny them neither, But cloath them in their folly: but are these Expressions of Parentall Offices? Oh no; while you are thus indulgent to them; Through too much love you utterly undoe them. For when they are attyred gorgeously, Their formall habits crave more liberty; Their eyes must have new Objects, which impart Secrets of love unto a wanton heart. Dinah must roame abroad, but ten to one She looseth honour ere she visit home. Prevent this, modest Matrons, let no staine Impeach their youth; vessels, you know, retaine A taste of their first liquor; season them With that at first which may accomplish them. All this my Deare One did, and so must yee That hope to live in your posteritie. Governement of her Family. Next, Fame reares to her Name a monument For house-affaires and private Government, While her well-guided Family might seeme A Patterne unto others to demeane Their actions by; since all desires were bent To close in one harmonious consent. No spleenefull Waspe might lodge within her roofe, All discontented Spirits stood aloofe. With willing care her pleasure all attend, Fearing nought more than that they should offend For she with mildnesse did her Servants win, Mildnesse to her Servants Sweetning th' endevours they were busied in. Yea, so much had her candid nature wonne, The Ev'ning joy'd ith' Day-works they had done. How far swerve ye from th' Patterne instanc'd here, Who o're your Servants use to domineere, As if they were your Slaves? which is no way To make your people cheerefully obey. This but begets Eye-service at the best, And makes an Holy-Day when you'r at rest. Others there be, who have occasion sought To beate their Servants, though it were for nought, Like Vedio, who for breaking of a glasse Would drowne his Page: let such Examples passe Unworthy your Observance: better farre, And to discretion farre more regular, To imitate Architas, who in's field Finding his Servant loyt'ring, would not yeeld Forthwith to Passion, but intreats him thus, Which may be presidentall unto us: “Sure I would beat thee, were I not in anger, “But that secures thee for this time from danger. But other vertues now I hasten to, Which did my late endeared Spouse endow. Love to her Neighbors. Next, to the Love she to her Neighbours bare Than which no Creature ever had more share; Were they infirme, she would not nicely stand, But to their griefes apply her helping hand, And dresse their wounds her selfe, for she was rare Both for her happy cure and holy care. Herbals Shee'd read, but timorous to erre, With men of choice Experience Shee'd conferre, Which so enabled her, as she was still By doing good, improving of her skill. Not like blind Herbists, whereof there be store, Who have but one bare cure for every sore: These, if they kill, they kill, and if they cure, Th' effect is farre above their reason sure. Now, to the last not least, for it is this Which gives us speedy Convoy unto blisse; Hospitality to Strangers.And that was, Strangers Hospitality: Where her Provision ever would supply Their necessary wants; nor all her time (Wherein her thoughts did ever close with mine) Would she avert her eare from any one Who for reliefe did to her Portell come. Her Cruse was ever open to the poore, Calling them Schollers of our Saviour: If they were old, or feebly impotent, An Almes with more bounty might be sent. No Stranger ere did to her gate repaire Confin'd to anguish, or surpriz'd with care, Shee would not comfort, and with dropping eye Afford compassion to their miserie. None hungry but Shee'd feed; no thirsty wretch But Shee'd refresh; Nor naked but shee'd fetch Garments to cover them. How farre be yee From these expressive Acts of Charitie, Who fed with Amber broaths, delitious fare, Have of your starved Sisters little care? Their rags are your contempt; their shreekes &amp; cryes Are boulted from your Eares, fann'd from your eyes. But how should you take pitty of these Elves, Who have no greater pitty on your selves? How should you couer them whom Colds molest, Who will not cover your loose-bared Brest In sharpest ayres, but rather starve your skin, Than shroud th' occasion of alluring sin? O doe not so; let gracious thoughts appeare To mould you to that Patterne you have heere. He clozeth this second Anniversary, as A votive Sacrifice to her memory.But I must leave; but never leave to love My glorious Saint, which now is sphear'd above; Who, if shee daigne t'accept this Sacrifice Dipt in a throbbing heart, and streaming eyes, I've got my Gole, and shee a treble rest, In Heav'n, in Earth, and in my naked brest. When Just ones die, then they to live begin, “They live to Sion, when they die to Sin. FINIS.</field>
