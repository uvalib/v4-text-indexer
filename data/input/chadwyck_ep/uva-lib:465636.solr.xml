      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAM. LYCE. Go, said old Lyce, senseless lover, go, And with soft verses court the fair, but know, With all thy verses, thou canst get no more Than fools without one verse have had before. Enrag'd at this, upon the bawd I flew; And that which most enrag'd me was, 'twas true. PASTORAL ECLOGUES. ECLOGUE I. DAPHNE. Sicilian muse my humble voice inspire To sing of Daphne's charms and Damon's fire. Long had the faithful swain supprest his grief And since he durst not hope, ne'er ask'd relief. But at th' arrival of the fatal day, That took the nymph and all his joys away, With dying looks he gaz'd upon the fair, And what his tongue cou'd not, his eyes declare: 'Till with deep sighs, as if his heart-strings broke, Pressing her hand, these tender things he spoke: Damon. Ah lovely nymph, behold your lover burn, And view the passion which you'll not return. As no nymph's charms did ever equal thine; So no swain's love did ever equal mine. How happy, fair, how happy should I be, Might I but sacrifice my self for thee? Cou'd I but please thee with my dying verse, And make thee shed one tear upon my herse? Daphne. Too free an offer of that love you make, Which now, alas, I have not pow'r to take: Your wounds I cannot, tho' I wou'd, relieve: Phaon has all the love that I can give. Had you among the rest at first assail'd My heart, when free, you had perhaps prevail'd. Now if you blame, oh blame not me, but fate, That never brought you 'till 'twas grown too late. Damon. Had the fates brought me then, too charming fair, I cou'd not hope, and now I must despair. Rul'd by your friends, you quit the lover's flame, For flocks, for pastures, for an empty name. Yet tho' the blest possession fate denies; Oh let me gaze for ever on those eyes. So just, so true, so innocent's my flame, That Phaon, did he see it, cou'd not blame. Daphne. Such gen'rous ends I know you still pursue, What I can do, besure I will for you. If on esteem, or pity, you can live, Or hopes of more, if I had more to give; Those you may have, but cannot have my heart: And since we now perhaps for ever part; Such noble thoughts through all your life express, May make the value more, the pity less. Damon. Can you then go? can you for ever part? Ye gods! what shivering pains surround my heart! And have one thought to make your pity less; Ah Daphne, cou'd I half my pangs express, You cou'd not think, tho' hard as rocks you were, Your pity ever cou'd too great appear. I ne'er shall be one moment free from pain, 'Till I behold those charming eyes again. When gay diversions do your thoughts employ, I wou'd not come to interrupt the joy: But when from them you some spare moment find, Think then, oh think on whom you leave behind! Think with what heart I shall behold the green, Where I so oft those charming eyes have seen! Think with what grief I walk the groves alone, When you, the glory of them all, are gone! Yet, oh! that little time you have to stay, Let me still speak, and gaze my soul away! But see, my passion that small aid denies; Grief stops my tongue, and tears o'er-flow my eyes. ECLOGUE II. GALATEA. Thyrsis, the gayest one of all the swains, Who fed their flocks upon th' Arcadian plains, While love's mad passion quite devour'd his heart, And the coy nymph that caus'd, neglects his smart, Strives in low numbers, such as shepherds use, If not to move her breast, his own t' amuse. You, Chloris, who with scorn refuse to see The mighty wounds that you have made on me; Yet cannot sure with equal pride disdain, To hear an humble hind of his complain. Now while the flocks and herds to shades retire, While the fierce sun sets all the world on fire; Thro' burning fields, thro' rugged brakes I rove, And to the hills and woods declare my love, How small's the heat? how easy is the pain I feel without, to that I feel within? Yet scornful Galatea will not hear, But from my songs and pipe still turns her ear. Not so the sage Corisca, nor the fair Climena, nor rich Ægon's only care: From them my songs a just compassion drew, And they shall have them, since contemn'd by you. Why name I them, when ev'n chaste Cynthia stays, And Pan himself, to listen to my lays? Pan, whose sweet pipe has been admir'd so long, Has not disdain'd sometimes to hear my song. Yet Galatea scorns whate'er I say; And Galatea's wiser sure than they. Relentless nymph! can nothing move your mind Must you be deaf, because you are unkind? Tho' you dislike the subject of my lays, Yet sure the sweetness of my voice might please. It is not thus that you dull Mopsus use, His songs divert you, tho' you mine refuse. Yet I cou'd tell you, fair one, if I wou'd, And since you treat me thus, methinks I shou'd, What the wise Lyoon said, when in yon plain He saw him court in hope, and me in vain; Forbear, fond youth, to chase a heedless fair, Nor think with well-tun'd verse to please her ear; Seek out some other nymph, nor e'er repine, That one who likes his songs, shou'd fly from thine. Ah, Lycon! ah! your rage false dangers forms; 'Tis not his songs, but 'tis his fortune charms: Yet, scornful maid, in time you'll find those toys Can yield no real, no substantial joys; In vain his wealth, his titles gain esteem, If for all that you are asham'd of him. Ah, Galatea, wou'dst thou turn those eyes, Wou'dst thou but once vouchsafe to hear my cries: In such soft notes I wou'd my pains impart, As cou'd not fail to move thy rocky heart; With such sweet songs I wou'd thy fame make known, As Pan himself might not disdain to own. Oh cou'dst thou, fair one, but contented be To tend the sheep, and chase the hares with me; To have thy praises eccho'd thro' the groves, And pass thy days with one who truly loves; Nor let those gaudy toys thy heart surprize, Which the fools envy, and the sage despise. But Galatea scorns my humble flame, And neither ask my fortune, nor my name. Of the best cheese my well-stor'd dairy's full, And my soft sheep produce the finest wool; The richest wines of Greece my vineyards yield, And smiling crops of grain adorn my field. Ah, foolish youth! in vain thou boast'st thy store, Have what thou wilt, if Mopsus still has more. See whil'st thou sing'st, behold her haughty pride, With what disdain she turns her head aside! Oh, why wou'd nature, to our ruin, place A tyger's heart, with such an angel's face? Cease, shepherd, cease at last thy fruitless moan; Nor hope to gain a heart already gone. While rocks and caves thy tuneful notes resound, See how thy corn lyes wither'd on the ground! The hungry wolves devour thy fatten'd lambs; And bleating for the young, makes lean the dams. Take, shepherd, take thy hook, thy flocks pursue, And when one nymph proves cruel, find a new. Delia. A pastoral Eclogue; lamenting the death of Mrs. Tempest, who died upon the day of the late storm. Ye gentle swains! who pass your days and nights In love's sincere and innocent delights! Ye, tender virgins, who with pride display Your beauty's splendor, and extend your sway! Lament with me! with me your sorrows join, And mingle your united tears with mine! Delia, the queen of love, let all deplore! Delia, the queen of beauty's now no more! Begin, my muse! begin your mournful strains! Tell the sad tale through all the hills and plains! Tell it through ev'ry lawn, and ev'ry grove, Where flocks can wander, or where shepherds rove! Bid neighb'ring rivers tell the distant sea, And winds from pole to pole the news convey! Delia, the queen of love, let all deplore! Delia, the queen of beauty's now no more! 'Tis done, and all obey the mournful muse! See hills, and plains, and winds have heard the news! The foaming sea o'erwhelms the frighten'd shoar, The vallies tremble, and the mountains roar. See lofty oaks from firm foundations torn, And stately towr's in heaps of ruin mourn! The gentle Thames, that rarely passion knows, Swells with this sorrow, and her banks o'erflows: What shrieks are heard? what groans? what dying cries? Ev'n nature's self in dire convulsion lyes! Delia, the queen of love, they all deplore! Delia, the queen of beauty's now no more! Oh! why did I survive the fatal day, That snatch'd the joys of all my life away? Why was not I beneath some ruin lost? Sunk in the seas, or shipwreck'd on the coast? Why did the fates spare this devoted head? Why did I live to hear that thou wert dead? By thee my griefs were calm'd, my torments eas'd; Nor knew I pleasure, but as thou wert pleas'd. Where shall I wander now, distress'd, alone? What use have I of life, now thou art gone? I have no use, alas! but to deplore Delia, the pride of beauty, now no more. What living nymph is blest with equal grace? All may dispute, but who can fill thy place? What lover in his mistress hopes to find A form so lovely, with so bright a mind? Doris may boast a face divinely fair, But wants thy shape, thy motions, and thy air. Lucinda has thy shape, but not those eyes, That while they did th' admiring world surprize, Disclos'd the secret lustre of thy mind, And seem'd each lover's inmost thoughts to find. Others, whose beauty yielding swains confess, By indiscretion make their conquest less, And want thy conduct and obliging wit, To fix those slaves who to their charms submit. As some rich tyrant hoards an useless store, That wou'd, well plac'd, enrich a thousand more; So didst thou keep a crowd of charms retir'd, Wou'd make a thousand other nymphs admir'd. Gay, modest, artless, beautiful, and young; Slow to resolve, in resolution strong; To all obliging, yet reserv'd to all; None cou'd himself the favour'd lover call; That which alone cou'd make his hopes endure, Was, that he saw no other swain secure. Whither, ah! whither are those graces fled? Down to the dark, the melancholy shade? Now, shepherds, now lament! and now deplore! Delia is dead, and beauty is no more! For thee each tuneful swain prepar'd his lays, His fame exalting, while he sung thy praise. Thyrsis, in gay and easy measures, strove To charm thy ears, and tune thy soul to love. Menalcus, in his numbers more sublime, Extoll'd thy virtues in immortal rhime. Glycon, whose satyr kept the world in awe, Softning his strain, when first thy charms he saw, Confess'd the goddess that new-form'd his mind, Proclaim'd thy beauties, and forgot mankind. Cease, shepherds, cease; the charms you sung are fled! The glory of our blasted isle is dead! Now join your griefs with mine! and now deplore Delia, the pride of beauty, now no more! Behold where now she lies, depriv'd of breath! Charming tho' pale, and beautiful in death! A troop of weeping virgins by her side; With all the pomp of woe, and sorrow's pride! Oh, early lost! oh, fitter to be led In chearful splendor to the bridal bed! Than thus conducted to th' untimely tomb, A spotless virgin, in her beauty's bloom! Whatever hopes superior merit gave, Let me, at least, embrace thee in the grave: On thy cold lips imprint a dying kiss: Oh! that thy coyness cou'd refuse me this! Such melting tears upon thy limbs I'll pour, Shall thaw their numbness, and thy warmth restore; Clasp'd to my glowing breast, thou may'st revive; I'll breathe such tender sighs shall make thee live. Or if severer fates that aid deny, If thou canst not revive, yet I may die. In one cold grave together may be laid The truest lover, and the loveliest maid. Then shall I cease to grieve, and not before; Then shall I cease fair Delia to deplore. But see, those dreadful objects disappear! The sun shines out, and all the heav'ns are clear: The warring winds are husht, the sea's serene, And nature soften'd shifts her angry scene. What means this sudden change? methinks I hear Melodious music from the heav'nly sphere! Listen, ye shepherds, and devour the sound! Listen! the saint, the lovely saint is crown'd! While we, mistaken in our joy and grief, Bewail her sate, who wants not our relief: From the pleas'd orbs she views us here below, And with kind pity wonders at our woe. Ah, charming saint! since thou are bless'd above, Indulge thy lovers, and forgive their love. Forgive their tears; who, press'd with grief and care, Feel not thy joys, but feel their own despair! HORACE. BOOK III. ODE III. IMITATED. Justum &amp; tenacem propositi virum, &amp;c. I The man that's resolute and just, Firm to his principles and trust, Nor hopes nor fears can blind; No passions his designs controul. Not love, that tyrant of the soul, Can shake his steddy mind. II Nor parties for revenge engag'd, Nor threat'nings of a court enrag'd, Nor storms where fleets despair: Nor thunder pointed at his head; The shatter'd world may strike him dead, Not touch his soul with fear. III From this the Grecian glory rose, By this the Romans aw'd their foes: Of this their poets sing. These were the paths their heroes trod, These acts made Hercules a god; And great Nassau a king. IV Firm on the rowling deck he stood, Unmov'd, beheld the breaking flood, With black'ning storms combin'd: Virtue, he cry'd, will force his way; The wind may for a while delay, Not alter our design. V The men whom selfish hopes enflame, Or vanity allures to fame, May be to fears betray'd: But here a church for succour flies, Insulted law expiring lies, And loudly calls for aid. VI Yes, Britons, yes, with ardent zeal, I come, the wounded heart to heal, The wounded hand to bind: See tools of arbitrary sway, And priests, like locusts, scout away Before the western wind. VII Law shall again her force resume; Religion, clear'd from clouds of Rome, With brighter rays advance. The British fleet shall rule the deep, The British youth as rous'd from sleep, Strike terror into France. VIII Nor shall these promises of fate Be limited to my short date: When I from cares withdraw Still shall the British scepter stand, Still flourish in a female hand, And to mankind give law. IX She shall domestic foes unite; Monarchs beneath her flags shall fight, Whole armies drag her chain: She shall lost Italy restore, Shall make th' imperial eagle soar, And give a king to Spain. X But know, these promises are giv'n, These great rewards imperial heav'n Does on these terms decree; That strictly punishing mens faults, You let their consciences and thoughts Rest absolutely free. XI Let no false politicks confine, In narrow bounds, your vast design To make mankind unite; Nor think it a sufficient cause To punish men by penal laws, For not believing right. XII Rome, whose blind zeal destroys mankind; Rome's sons shall your compassion find, Who ne'er compassion knew. By nobler actions theirs condemn: For what has been reproach'd in them, Can ne'er be prais'd in you. XIII These subjects suit not with the lyre; Muse! to what height dost thou aspire; Pretending to rehearse The thoughts of gods, and godlike kings. Cease, cease to lessen lofty things By mean ignoble verse. The golden age restor'd. A poem in imitation of the fourth pastoral of Virgil; suppos'd to have been taken from a Sybilline prophecy. ? Paulo majora canamus. Sicilian muse, begin a loftier flight; Not all in trees and lowly shrubs delight: Or if your rural shades you still pursue, Make your shades fit for able statesmens view. The time is come, by ancient bards foretold, Restoring the Saturnian age of gold: The vile, degenerate, whiggish off-spring ends, A high-church progeny from heav'n descends. O learned Oxford, spare no sacred pains To nurse the glorious breed, now thy own B?ley reigns. And thou great S?l, darling of this land, Do'st foremost in that fam'd commission stand; Whose deep remarks the list'ning world admires, By whose auspicious care old Ra?gh expires. Your mighty genius no strict rules can bind; You punish men for crimes, which you want time to find. Senates shall now like holy synods be, And holy synods senate-like agree, M?th and M?n here instruct the youth, There B?ks and Kim?ly maintain the sacred truth. P?s and H?lin here with equal claim, Thro' wide West-Saxon realms extend their fame; There B?ch and H?per right divine convey, Nor treat their bishops in a human way. Now all our factions, all our fears shall cease, And tories rule the promis'd land in peace. Malice shall die, and noxious poisons fail, H?y shall cease to trick, and S?ur cease to rail: The lambs shall with the lyons walk unhurt, And H?x with H?meet civilly at court. Viceroys, like providence, with distant care, Shall govern kingdoms where they ne'er appear. Pacific admirals, to save the fleet, Shall fly from conquest, and shall conquest meet: Commanders shall be prais'd at William's cost, And honour be retriev'd before 'tis lost. Br?ton and Bur?by the court shall grace, And H? shall not disdain to share a place. Forgotten Molineux and Mason now Revive and shine again in F? and H?. But as they stronger grow and mend their strain, By choice examples of king Charles's reign: Bold Bel?sis and patriot Da?nant then, One shall employ the sword, and one the pen: Troops shall be led to plunder, not to fight, The tool of faction shall to peace invite, And foes to union be employ'd the kingdoms to unite. Yet still some whigs, among the peers are found, Like brambles flourishing in barren ground. Som?rs maliciously employs his care To make the lords the legislature share. Bu?t declares how French dragooning rose, And bishops persecuting bills oppose: 'Till Ro?r's cool temper shall be fir'd, And N?th's and Not?m's strong reas'nings be admir'd. But when due time their councels shall mature, And fresh removes have made the game secure; When Som?et and Dev?ire give place To Windham's B?d, and to R?d's grace, Both converts great; when justice is refin'd, And corporations garbled to their mind, Then passive doctrines shall with glory rise; Before them hated moderation flies, And antichristian toleration dies. G?ile shall seize the long-expected chair, Go?in to some country-seat repair; P?ke from all employments be debar'd, And Mar?gh for ancient crimes receive his just reward. France, that this happy change so wisely has begun, Shall bless the great design, and bid it smoothly run. Come on, young J?'s friends, this is the time, come on; Receive just honours, and surround the throne. Boldly your loyal principles maintain, H?s now rules the state, and R? the main. Gr?es is at hand the members to reward, And troops are trusted to your own Gr?rd. The faithful clubs assemble at the vine, And French intrigues are broach'd o'er English wine, Freely the S?te the designs proclaims, Affronting W?m, and applauding J?es. Good antient members with a solemn face, Purpose that safety give to order place; And what they dare not openly dissuade, Is by expedients ineffectual made. E'en F?ch and Mu?ve, whom the court caress, Exalt its praises, but its power depress; And that impartial justice may be seen, Confirm to friends what they refus'd the queen. Bishops who most advanc'd good J?'s cause In church and state, now reap deserv'd applause: While those who rather made the tow'r their choice, Are styl'd unchristian by the nation's voice. Avow'dly now St. David's cause thy own, And J?es's votes for simony atone. Archbishop K?n shall from Longleaf be drawn, While firm nonjurers from behind stand crowding for the lawn. And thou, great W?th, to reward thy charge, Shalt sail to Lambeth in his grace's barge. See by base rebels Ja?es the just betray'd, See his three realms by vile U?rs sway'd; Then see with joy his lawful h? restor'd, And erring nations own their injur'd l?. O would kind heaven so long my life maintain, Inspiring raptures worthy such a reign! Not Thracian St. J?ns should with me contend, Nor my sweet lays harmonious Ha?nd mend: Not tho' young Dav'nant St. J?ns should protect, Or the shrewd doctor Ha?nd's lines correct. Nay should Tr?am in St. Maws compare his songs to mine; Tr?am, tho' St. Maws were judge, his laurel should resign. Prepare, auspicious youth, thy friends to meet; Sir G? already has prepar'd the fleet. Should rival Neptune, who with envious mind In times of danger still this chief confin'd, Now send the gout, the hero to disgrace, Honest G? Ch? may supply his place.</field>
