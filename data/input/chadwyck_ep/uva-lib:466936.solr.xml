      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON, Bart., M.P. CORAYDA. PART I. I.âTHE HOME OF CHILDHOOD 'Twas in an ancient kingdom In the old world far away, In those ages dim and grey, Where 'mid the lonely mountains A pastoral province lay. 'Twas in a valley, holy With the quiet melancholy Of its woodland and its hill, Where a cottage nestled lowly Beside a highland rill. The stream was threaded silver, But travellers had told How it grew a mighty river Between its sands of gold, And floated bannered navies, And imaged cities old. The sound of far achievement Came o'er that solitude With a melody subdued, As the voice of unfelt tempest When heard across the wood. For mighty deeds were doing In the old world far away, In those ages dim and grey, When fame was worth the wooing, And chivalry held sway. Before that lowly dwelling, At the still fall of the night, When the fairy moon was bright With the poetry of light, A youthful heart was swelling In the fulness of its might, And o'er the wistful child Sang the spirits of the wild. II.âTHE SPIRITS' CALL. The stag-hound pants for the bugle call, The steed strikes the ground as he waits in the stall, The eagle looks up when the thunder is nigh, And brooks not to rest though his eyrie be high, Corayda! The falcon will dart from his hood to the skies, As the fire of his heart overflows through his eyes; All are strainingâattainingâor seeking a goal: The soulless are stirringâwhy slumbers thy soul, Corayda? Hark! Voices are calling from far and from near, And dull is the spirit that recks not to hear; The statues, they speak in their funeral caves, And old bards are sending thee songs from their graves, Corayda! There is duty before thee, wherever thou art: Then up, and unfurl the strong wings of thy heart! 'Tis treason to idle when action is free; Thou needest the world, and the world needeth thee, Corayda! III.âTHE ANSWER. The boy upgazed from his lowly seat Through the gloom of the solemn night, Where the clouds were flecked with the silvery feet Of the stars in their fiery flight. They waved as black as the raven braid On a pale queen's forehead bound, And the earth seemed only a deeper shade 'Mid the shadows that mantled around: But glorious hopes from his high-beating heart Came mounting and gathering fast, As forth from a lofty nest young eagles dart, And rush out on the night and the blast; And the gloom rolled back, like a cloud in the west When the splendours of sunrise begin, For the darkness without is an atom at best, But a world is the radiance within; And the soul of emprise that replied in his breast Had the courage that fails not to win. âWelcome, welcome the day of strife! And welcome the foeman brave! And he who neglects the call to life, Let him die as an abject slave. Wrong may baffle the right a while, And virtue may yield to crime; But the help of my need, And the gods of my creed, Be Energy, Faith, and Time. âWhile the mind still reigns in its kingly dome, While the heart in the breast beats still, There is nothing so stubborn, wherever we roam, But must yield to the conquering will. And long as I march in the ranks of life I will swear by those gods sublime; For what shall withstand The invincible hand Of Energy, Faith, and Time?â IV.âTHE PARTING HOUR. The hour, the hour has come, that parts The son from his mother's side; The hour that scatters the household hearts On life's tempestuous tide. Oh! fondly on his mother's breast Will sleep the mother's joy; And fondly at his father's knee Will play the jocund boy: But years will pass, and thoughts will roam, And time steal hearts away; And a sterner nurse and a wider home He seeks in his ruder day. Sweet childhood's quiet dreams have fled, New hopes are hurrying o'er. âFather! I heard the voice that said, âYoung spirit, rest no more! ââAway! away! beyond the bound Of the home that grows too small: Away! away! beyond the sound Of the pleasant voices all!â â'Tis heavy and hot in the valley here, And my heart feels ill at ease; Beyond the hills 'tis cold and clear, And I long for the freshening breeze.â âMy son! my son! out yonder, I've heard, There 's a toilsome war to wage; For the years of youth there is hope deferred, And regret for the hours of age. âAnd many a flower is there to die, No sun on its viewless bloom; And lights that might be stars on high Are lamps in a living tomb.â âOh! never a pearl in watery waste, Or a bud on loneliest lea, But the hand of their God with a purpose placed, With the eye of their God to see. âTo toil unrepining, though reaping no fame, Is the test to the great-hearted given; But gather the darkness, or brighten the flame, The harvest will ripen in heaven.â Then âBless thee!â cried that aged sire; He caught the spirit from his son: So like their glances' kindred fire, The twain they looked like one. Slow from the porch Corayda steppedâ So slow life's first link parts; His father prayed, and his mother wept, And his shadow fell back on their hearts. V.âOLDEN DAYS. Those were the glorious, gallant days Of hero-feats and poet-lays. Out on the world the high hearts rushed As rivers upon deserts gushed: As rivers upon deserts bring The blessings of undying spring, So, where they passed in glory's hours, Rose gentle bloom of deathless flowers. Then warlike men of ancient name Deemed all that was not honour, shame; Not, not as now our goal we make, Content to live for living's sake; And when the soldier came to woo With honest heart a heart as true, They questioned not what lands he'd won, But nobly asked what deeds he'd done. Unheeding whence their hero came, They chose a man, and not a name. And warriors old from warrings wild, With truthful spirits, kind and mild, With deeds that live, and faith that saves, Sank smiling into peaceful graves. Then bards sang not for rank or gold, For honour was not bought and sold; And harps were then as sacred things As crowns upon anointed kings. Oh! were not those the glorious days Of hero-feats and poet-lays? Mayhap at times the evil thought A blight upon their brightness brought, And men, uncaring and uncared, Would mar the bliss they might have shared, And for a time would hold their sway, As storms hang darkening on the day:â As whirlwinds dash the storms away, Gallant harps to honour strung, And gallant songs to glory sung, And gallant swords in knightly hand Would sweep them from the frowning land. Oh! were not those the glorious days Of hero-feats and poet-lays? VI.âTHE YOUNG SOLDIER'S FIRST FIELD. It was the young soldier's first field, And bravely he battled it through; He belted his sword and he cast down his shield As only the bravest may do. And loudly the storm rolled along Till the battle was ebbing away, And it fell on his ear like a chivalrous song Heard at the dying of day. The field began thinning apace, And the air growing darker and cold, And the north wind was wrinkling the heavens' pale face As he gathered the clouds in his fold. The horsemen were galloping past To the call of the far trumpet-throe, And he knew by the tone of the shattering blast That his monarch was beating the foe. His comrades were passing him byâ No time now for greeting or stayâ And he met the cold glance of the pitiless eye As low on his banner he lay. His pulses beat wavering and weak, Subsiding in slumber and pain, When a spirit-like touch on his fast fading cheek Recalled him to life once again. 'Twas the snow falling silent and swift, And the wounded boy blessed it aloud, As with parched tongue he caught at the freshening drift, And drank from the cup of the cloud. The darkness was flowing around Like streamers of conquering death, And the whirlwinds of battle and tempests of sound Were wailing away to a breath. Hark! a muster drum rolling afar! Straight a hundred are swelling the strain; Come gathering and trampling the ranks of the war O'er the snow-shrouded ranks of the slain. They were marching all spectral and pale In the gleam of the night's sullen noon; And the torches that lit them were helmet and mail, As they flamed in the face of the moon. The stern monarch gazed o'er the plain, And his proud heart with victory fed; He nor counted the living, nor counted the slainâ What to him were the live or the dead? But his banners were passing him slow, And proudly he numbered them o'er: âThere is one that has fall'n in the hands of the foe! Now shame to the craven who bore!â That pealed on the ear of the boy With a knelling of pleasure and pain; And upward he bounded with wild, dying joy, And stood to his banner again. Life swooned, on the wing to depart, He heard not the cheers round him ring; But he waved it once more with the strength of his heart, And fell at the feet of the king! VII.âTHE KING. Borne with his banner as he fell, Saved from the field he fought so well,â Tended in the royal tent, Where haughty monarchs humbly bent,â Raised to the sovereign's household train (Reward for those of gentle strain, But here bestowed as tribute high To valour's true nobility), Corayda, rescued from the grave, Vowed to his king the life he gave. And well that monarch's spirit stern To glory's touch could melt or burn, While death would pass his icy eye Unpitied and unheeded by. Within his castle you might see All spirits stern and bold as he; No courtiers bland with ready smile, But hate was hate, and guile was guile. He read their secrets through and through, And every man his master knew. Nor shrunk he from the traitor bold, But called him to his very hold, And made him serve him long and nigh, And watched him with his own keen eye. He was not lovedâhe was revered; And friends obeyed, for foemen feared. The dangers he decreed, he dared; Was slow to smite, but seldom spared; And soldiers' hearts, by valour bought, Would fight for him who with them fought. For mercy it were vain to press; But wrong was sure to meet redress. He lived in good old royal state, But simple grandeur kept his gate; His kingly majesty was shown More in himself than in his throne, Till those who would his bearing scan Forgot the monarch in the man. Oh! many ages few shall bring, Like this, our true old warlike king. VIII.âLOVE'S CONFESSIONAL. It is a sweet and sultry night, When woods are dark and skies are light, And earth seems like a globe of jet Amid an orb of silver set, Whence stars look downward, large and clear, As though God's heaven were drawing near. The palace chambers are unlit, And shades like arras clothe the wall, Where solemn statues silent sit In life-like gloom adown the hall. With tread so dull no echo stirred, Pace of guard at portal far Like minute-stroke of time was heard, Monotonous and regular; But drowsy died the weary round, And slower still the footstep fell, Till o'er his halberd, slumber-bound, Leant the lazy sentinel; And few there be who still may take For joy or care one hour to wake, Save one young page, who may not sleep, Though others their dull chamber keep, But still doth watch, and pray, and weep, And feel by inspiration true, That when the stars are shining too, A living light will come and shine, And downward from a casement gaze, Like some sweet saint from lofty shrine Upon a heart that loves and prays. And well he knows when earth is still, And quiet glides from every hill, And sends forth song and shade and dew On forest brown and mountain blueâ When fondling winds are kissing leaves, That tremble with a faint delight, And every opening bud receives Its dewy lover in the nightâ And chant the rivers low and dim, She too will sing, and sing for him. She was a maid of royal lineâ He was a page of poor degree; But all who love with love divine Are crowned with kingliest royalty. Out on the thought that heart can sleep With love's sweet dream, and not awake! Out on the thought that heart can keep Secret so burning, and not break! Though of their love they breathed no word, Though eyes were downcast, lips were mute, Yet all was told where nought was heard. Thus know we, though no chord be stirred, That music sleeps within a lute. Needs there no language, needs no art, As flame draws flame, so heart draws heart. Hark! from her balcony she sings! The page in silent rapture clings All trembling at the column's base, With pale, upturned, and eager face; And as the song comes hovering o'er, Each moment burns his spirit more; His hand is on the column cold, His foot upon the tracery bold, Unconscious all of rest or holdâ Thought, memory, hope, to her are flown, And leave him life and love alone. He seems borne up by some wild art, Borne up by wings within his heart, With raptureâoh! scarce death could tameâ So heart draws heart as flame draws flame. The gulf is passed, not to retrace; The lamplight pale upon his face Casting a melancholy grace, As breathless at her feet he kneels, His long, soul-speaking look reveals. Voiceless and swift, from eye to eye, Hope, wish, inquiry, answer fly; Till the vast barrier reared by fate, Of pomps and treasures, thrones and state, Seems thin as moonlight to their sense, Beneath that look's omnipotence. Some wild sound falters from his tongue Like music from a harp unstrung, And then they nearer draw and near, With pulses mingling joy and fear, Till the long doubt is solved at last In one wild, agonising kiss. Oh! what to this is all the past? What has the future like to this? Sudden they startedâcame no sound! Each gazed abashed upon the groundâ The blushing girl, the death-pale page. A moment passedâno, 'twas an age! The ringdove fluttered in its cage. Came o'er her face One flash of pride; One moment's space She turned aside; One struggleâoneâthe last between The world without, the worlds withinâ Then gave her hand. On bended knee He touched it most religiously, And poured into that meek caress All, all his spirit's holiness; Not, as but erst, with wild embrace, But trembling lip and downward face. How flushed her cheek, how glowed her eyes, With love and hope and sweet surprise, Too fondly dreaming nought could part From loving heart the loving heart! But oh! Corayda's cheek turned pale As memory told another tale; In his cold hand her hand he took, And pointed with his drooping look To where, inwrought with many a gem, Careless was cast a diadem. She bowed her like a wounded dove, And only wept, âI love! I love!â What heaven unites earth cannot part; As flame draws flame, so heart draws heart. IX.âTHE PARTING. The moon hung low on the rim of the mist, His last had the nightingale sung, When the lover came from his sweet lovetryst, Where the roses of passion clung. In his glance was the flash of a victor's pride, A light on his forehead above, For life's other triumphs are poor by the side Of youth's first garland of love; And a conqueror greater is he by far, One pure loving heart who gains, Than he who may stand as the lord of war On a thousand battle plains. But dark grew the garden, and dimmer the sky, And dark was the casement above, And treason was watching, and danger was nigh, For hate is the shadow of love. X.âCONSPIRACY. Three men stood back in a darkling spot Beneath an ancient tree, But they were so busy they heeded not When they stepped in the moonlight free. They stood too close for all but illâ All three were speaking quick and still: More close they drew all three. And they were planning a devilish plan The grey-haired king to slay. Afar the woof of treason ran To many a discontented man, And the viewless threads held theyâ To many a watchful enemy, To many a traitor lurking nigh, And armies far away. It needeth but a single blow, And those dark fires that smouldering glow Will lighten fierce and free; Then o'er their plans they chuckle low, With heavy laughter welling slow, Shook by their hearts' uneasy throe, And cry, âTrue comrades we! And none are here the thought to know, And none will be the hand to show, Or mark the steel that strikes the blow In night's deep mystery.â But as they turned into the shade, The glitter that the moonlight made Upon Corayda's dagger-blade Struck terror to their treachery. Then the first his weapon drew, And a ghastly smile smiled he: âThere were four,â he cried, âof a secret knew; And the fourth, he kept it as long and true As the truest of the three.â Back bent the page with wary eye: âTraitor! the step that bears thee nigh, Shall find an echo in a cry, Ere thou canst smite or I can die, Brings witness and avenger too!â Palsy seized the uplifted hand; Each plotter stood with baffled rage, And glared a moment on the page, When spake the second of the band: âOne shout will bring the avenger near? Ho, page! we wait that call to hear. No word?ââThey stood as silent all As shadows cast against a wall. âNay, nay! methinks I know the spell That seals the listener's lip so well. See! tangled bough and broken flower, And trailing stem and midnight hour, Tell of a tryst in fairy bower, Andâsave my fancy hath beguiledâ With Amorine, thy monarch's child!â With quivering brow and lip compressed, And dagger clenched against his breast, Corayda stood; one step he made, But met that old man's devilish mirthâ As though a frost a torrent stayed, That look has rooted him to earth. âNow, boy! we both have much to tell, And both can keep a secret wellââ Swift turned the page. With sudden bound Speeds not more swift the scenting hound, Nor scuds the wind upon the wrack, Than the pursuers on his track; For hope of vengeance, fear, and rage, Gave strength of youth to stalwart age. âStay! stay!â their cries in whispers ring; âStay! whither speeding?âââTo the king!â Short space yet to the palace gateâ Short shriving time for wrath or hate, When spake of that dark three the third: âHold back! for struggle, clash, or shout, Would bring the watchful warders out To seize us ere we gained delay, Our gathering friends to warn away. The king must live another day! Haste! haste! from post to post! Sir Palm, Sir Talenc, he may go, And not a surer overthrow I wish unto the deadliest foe Ambition ever crossed.â A sign, a glance, a whisper low, And like swift shadows over snow, Athwart the moony lawn's white glow The flitting twain are lost. Sir Guivro then, with step subdued, Glided beneath an archway rude, By lichens overtossed. XI.âTHE CORRIDOR. The clustered lights are gleaming Adown the corridor, And nightly dews are steaming The casements richly teeming With legendary lore, Where saints, in holy seeming, Their penance life-redeeming For endless ages bore; And ladies softly glancing; And knights to battle prancing With chargers unadvancing, And war-plumes never dancing, Though angry winds may roar, From forth their stand supernal Gaze down with look eternal, Cold, soulless, thought-escheating, Like conquerors, time defeating, So fragile, yet unfleeting, On races fleeting o'er. The moonlight, white and hoary, Cast on each pictured story A life-renewing glory, As passed the page before; And one by one faint smiling, Those shadows fancy-wiling, They caught the light beguiling, Then darkened dim and frore. But onward all unheeding, Corayda, swiftly speeding, Has passed the inner door; While, slowly ringing after, Faint echo came like laughter, And chased him on before. XII.âTHE ROYAL CHAMBER. Throughout the halls a heavy calm was spread, Like the dull awe that consecrates the dead. The varlets few who stood from porch to porch Had sunk to sleep by each extinguished torch; But, as Corayda passed, the instinctive hand Moved drowsily towards the unreached brand. Anon subside they in oppression blindâ His step had reached the ear, but not the mind; And here and there, with slumber-broken strength, A half-dressed page had fallen in listless length, Who, as he caught the swiftly-crossing shade, With lip unclosed mechanically prayed. Corayda passed in silence one by one, Unknowing whom to trust or whom to shun, With step subdued and terror-bated breath, Intent to warn the king of threatened death, Till crimson draperies o'er an archway cast Told him the dangerous goal was found at last. In folds all motionless the curtains hung, A living silence to the threshold clung, Like some hushed sentry standing at the door To warn the sounding foot to fall no more. With doubtful hand he moved the folds aside, And gazed athwart, fixed, pale, and eager-eyed. Is it the gloom that mocks the eye untaught With gaze that from intensity sees nought? The very air is thickening into stone: The monarch's couch is voidâhe seems alone! His hand unclasped, down rustling, strangely loud, The curtain closed behind him like a cloud. One step across the threshold stone he made; Sure more than echo answered from the shade. âStand!â burst a voice in startling thunder, âstand!â Fell on Corayda's arm an iron hand, While came the hollow words with boding peal, âWhat seeks by royal couch the midnight steel? Ho, lieges! to the rescue of the king!â Sharp on the hush the clashing carbines ring; From forth a dark recess the curtains swept, And gloomy guards like moving statues stepped. Up gazed the page, and caught the monarch's eye Fixed on his own, stern, calm, immovably. Again; and o'er him like a sudden blight, Unvarying once its cold, grey, glittering light, Sir Guivro's look weighed down. He turned away, And met the guards' long, motionless array; Glanced down that line of faces without soul, As seeking for some kind, familiar goal, While that stern gaze, in which suspicion wrought, Cast on his face the shadow of its thought. The truth fell faltering from Corayda's tongue, But loud and clear the ready falsehood rung: âMy liege! I found him stealing from the shrine That holds our royalty, young Amorine. The deed's discovery, and thine anger's fear, Chasing the lover, drove the assassin here, Our lives to forfeit with a ready lie. He dared to murder, though he feared to die. By shorter path I gained thy couch in time, To slay the falsehood and prevent the crime. âWhat prates he of conspiring traitors three? Sir Palm? Sir Talenc? They were not with me. Sendâseek them! Ask where tarried they to-night, And by that one inquiry test the right.â Swift sped the messengerâas swift returned As though expectancy his footstep burned. He found Sir Palm in seeming revel deep, Sir Talenc on his couch, as bound in sleep; And roundly swore false grooms and varlets all, Neither that night had left his palace hall. âTake hence the assassin!â and triumphant hate Held on Sir Guivro's brow its fiendish state. XIII.âTHE PRISON CELL. Where, wrapt in bondage gloom, Corayda waits his doom, The wind is sadly sighing, Past prison turrets flying, And the sun is sliding low Down the mountain-side of snow. Across the dungeon walls The grating shadow falls, Higher still and higher As sinks the setting fire; The city lies below, Half kindled by the glow, With rings of ruddy gold Around the church towers rolled By sunset's gaudy hand, Painter of fairy-land; While all beneath is black As midnight tempest-wrack. The birds with hurried flight Sweep homeward for the night, With a quick and restless cry Wheeling nigh and still more nigh, Then settling far away On trees and turrets grey, And waiting, still and lorn, Dim sentinels, for morn. The sounds die one by one At the feet of the dying sun, And stealthy silence fleets Through dark, deserted streets, Till in the city wide Fails life's stagnating tide, And single pulses only Throb in its bosom lonely, Monotonous and drear, Like a heart that beats in fear. 'Tis now the hallowed time 'Twixt night and evening's prime, When nature turns to pray At the deathbed of the day. All earth grows solemn-still; The deer couch on the hill; The pausing rivers flow To a music saintly slow; The night-flower on the sod Looks meekly up to God, As his dewy angels pass From blade to blade of grass; A holy whisper creeps From the forest ere it sleeps; The mountains seem upturning To the stars above them burning, Those altars, angel-lighted, To the God of the benighted; And a sound is on the air Like the spirit of a prayer. It was the hallowed time 'Twixt night and evening's prime. XIV.âTWILIGHT. Then sank a feeling on Corayda's breast, Half hope, half fear, half peace, and half unrest. He scarce could turn to mourn his captive state, Life seemed so short, creation was so great. Before the eternal hosts in heaven arrayed, His prison walls seemed nothing but a shade; Earth but an altar to creation's King, The soul its incense, life its offering. And if at times the captive heart oppressed Throbbed for a sigh to flutter from the breast, He heard the distant descant, low and deep, Where o'er their forest harp the breezes sweep, Whose awful, melancholy anthem rings In million tones from off its million strings, And each faint sigh of lonely grief seemed drowned Beneath that solemn majesty of sound. Then on his spirit fell the lonesome curse: âWhat is one life amid that universe? While those vast voices ceaselessly prolong Their grand, unchanged eternity of song, What recks it if the dying heart's last tone Be prayer or curse, a triumph or a groan?â The while he thought, deep in the lowest shade And loneliest nook of a sequestered glade, That in dim darkness and seclusion sweet Lay at that towering city's marble feet, Warbled a nightingale a faint, low song, That sweetness only made surpassing strong. 'Mid all the blasts through that lone gloom updriven, Unmingled and unlost it rose to heaven. Then to his heart returned the glory mild, That doubt should never quench in God's true child. On that melodious prayer he poured his own, Nor deemed his voice unheard, his thought unknown. Though darkened worlds around in ruin fall, The true, the beautiful, survives them all. XV.âTHE TEMPTATION. 'Tis midnight in the prison cell, And soon the morrow's matin bell May ring Corayda's funeral knell. The moon had climbed the southern height, And kindly came the rising light, Like some sweet saint's hand, ghostly white, Through grating dark and arching stone In pity held to the captive lone. But hark! along the dusky stair Sir Guivro and his friends repair. Corayda's words began to find An echo in the monarch's mind; And though the coming sun might see Fulfilment of the death decree, The traitors feared each hour would bring Reprieve and question from the king. Give but of proof one shadow more, And all their life of lies is o'er. They would have slain him in his cell, But he was guarded far too well; The heavy bribe alone could pay Unto the dungeon grate their way; In safer keep, the iron door Still rose their wished-for prey before. Then deep their cunning lure they press, With fear of death and hope of life, To triumph 'mid his spirit's strife, And make him, in his soul's distress, Imaginary guilt confess. That morn the king had heard their prayer, A felon's forfeit life to spare. The crime confessed, and mercy sought, The pardon's precious scroll they brought, And when the king the page had read, But ere his royal sign he traced, Another sheet before him placed, That bore Corayda's name instead. Thus with the well-wrought lure they hied Unto their death-doomed victim's side. âOne word,â they cried, âand thou art freed: Thou need'st but own the intended deed. Our proof so strong, our charge so grave, No innocence avails to save.â A smile passed o'er Corayda's face. Had Heaven, relenting, sent him grace? Sudden he paused. âTo fix thy mind, Behold thy pardon ready signed, Placed in our keeping at our prayer, If thou confess, that we may spare. For though 'tis we arraigned thy guilt, We shrink from blood thus idly spilt; And that dread charge was meant to be Life to ourselves, not death to thee.â Hope sparkled in the captive's eyes. âGiveâlet me touch the precious prize.â They held the pardon through the grate, With hands that shook from wrath and hate, Whilst with insidious lure from hell The tempters' wily accents fell: âIf thou confess not, where the gain? Death seals for aye thy memory's stain. If thou confess, the future time May help thee yet disprove the crime.â Shook all his frame with inward strife; One moment his brave spirit bowed, Then shone like starlight o'er a cloud, With all its undimmed glory rife. âNay, good from evil never rose, And fame from falsehood never flows. Since choose I must, my choice is ta'en Between my honour and my life.â The pardon 's in the captive's handâ Beneath the grate the tempters stand; But ere Sir Guivro could regain The fateful scroll, from portal near Was heard the guards' advancing tread, And in discovery's sudden fear The startled traitors turned and fled. Quick passed the watch, but 'neath the cell It left an added sentinel. XVI.âTHE JUDGMENT DAY. The citizens are thronging Fast to the justice place; A wild and feverish longing Is flushing every face. Gentle eyes are straining To catch a sight of fear, And threatening and complaining Are jarring on the ear. The deep and sullen tones Of their million-footed tread Are shattering on the stones, Are hurtling overhead. The balconies are garnished, And the windows every one; And the countless heads are varnished By the gleaming of the sun. Each house its tribute pours, And every street its share; The crowds flow backward through the doors, So full the thoroughfare; And still the tide From every side Is setting on the square. It seemed o'erflooding long ago, And not a span's breadth to remain; Still in that gulf the living flow Is streaming, and is lost again, Head by head so closely blended, As though the pavement had ascended. And then they clash and strive and meet, And whelm, and whirl, and smother; Like million waves the million feet Flood back upon each other. Above them expectation sleeps Like tempest on the seas, And now and then a rumour creeps Across them like a breeze, And to and fro, with swell and sway, It swings the mass and fleets away. And every eye and every face With one expression fraught, Is turning to the selfsame place: Stands man by man, with not a space, Cemented by one thought. The king is on his burnished throne: Far other sight seek they; He scarcely gains a glance or toneâ The king's no king this day. Beside the block the headsman standsâ At times on him they glance; The axe within his thirsting hands Shines brighter than a lance. And black and gaunt above his head Frowns down the scaffold-tree; They long to see it reeking red, For 'tis a sight to see. The hushed air throbbed round roof and spire With hot and sullen flow; Spread like an orb of smouldering fire The listening crowd below. Lone in the glare Corayda stood, And a wind that far had strayed Across that living solitude With his long hair faintly played. 'Twas like a warm hand's soft caress, 'Twas like a human tone: That spirit of the wilderness Came visiting the lone. He stood so mournful and so proud, So meek, and yet so high, That maid and matron cried aloud, âHe is too fair to die.â While to the monarch's chair of state Three men were pressing near: Upon each face was written hate, And on each lip a falsehood sate, And on each forehead fear. Broke from Corayda's lip no tone; Cold, yet flushed and fixed as stone, He felt not that, of all that throng, Full every eye with question strong Was fixed upon his own. He saw not, filling that vast space, Those countless faces, like one face Upturned to his alone; Nor block below, nor axe above: He was away with death and love. Passed through the crowd a muffled stir, A wonder crept from man to man; Smiling the executioner His hand along the axe-edge ran. Then of that hoary-headed three Each turned to each with flendish glee, And something like a stony smile Crawled o'er their thin grey lips the while; And coldly then they laughed and jeered, And taunted more the less they feared, As dastards ever do; Then âGuilty!â cried that three aloud, And âGuilty! guilty!â roared the crowd; The judgment clove from earth to cloud, As heaven should speak it too. Then flashed Corayda's eye one flame, Then sunrise to his forehead came, And bending round in proud surprise On that vast living, moving zone, That mighty glance of million eyes He seemed to gather in his own, And with its concentrated frown To gaze his false accusers down; And fell his words so calm and clear, It was a wondrous thing to hear: âThy mercy, king, for culprit meant, Was useless to the innocent: Takeâtake thy pardon back!â The fraud revealed, the forgery shown, The impulse given, the truth was known; The traitors writhed before the throne Like culprits on the rack; They strove to answerâdied the tone; They strove to smile â their lips were stone; They stood as very life were flown On long-lost honour's track. And âGuilty!â then that look avowed, And âGuilty! guilty!â roared the crowd; The judgment clove from earth to cloud, And heaven returned it back. The guards advancedânone gave the word; No voice was raised, no answer heard; No sign forbade, no arm was stirred, While that mute sentence wrought; But plainer still on each pale face, Usurping bold effrontery's place, Stood out, fast gathering trace on trace, The spirit of their thought. Then, like an earthquake on a shore, That rends the rocks with mighty roar, And lures the breakers in and o'er, Up rose the vast acclaim; Far flashed the guarded line along, Waved lances in the sunlight strong, As though the ardours of the throng Were gushing up in flame. But lowly then Corayda bowed, Then downward sank that look so proud; Then first he shrank before the crowd, And but one prayer he breathed aloud: âO monarch, bid me die!â And low the king, all heart-beguiled, Inclined him to that page and smiled, With trouble-shaken eye: âKneel, gallant soul! True metal, ring! He is a knight who saved a king. But for the blood that beat too boldâ Time make it tame, and absence cold. Ambition honours may content; Love's only cure is banishment.â PART II. I.âTHE WANDERER. Through peace and war, and varying scenes of life, Whose peace is but another name for strife, Corayda passed, with heart unwarped and true, Still strong to act what duty bade him do. Not, not as some beneath affliction sink, And fill with their own tears the cup they drink, His the brave spirit great enough to hope, Though vanished years their mournful memories ope. Led by the star, not eddied by the blast, He with the golden future gilds the past, Strong with the strength time neither takes nor gives, That with the immortal in our spirit lives. Full soon Corayda won a knightly fame, And warlike followers rallied to his name. The wise shall win the homage of the bold; The steel may conquer, but the mind must hold. Still doomed to struggle, and still forced to roam, 'Mid life's wild pauses oft came thoughts of home, And once in peaceful hoursâhow brief and few!â Back to his native vale the wanderer drew. 'Twas on the evening of a toilsome day, When horse and man were weary with their way, Ere night's serene and humid hand had brought The flowers their dew-cups of pale moon-gold wrought, When at his feet the long-lost valley lay. Then with a soundless sign his band he stayed; He could not break the silence of that glade, Where slept the quiet echoes of his youth, With war's rude clangs and harmonies uncouth. There stood the cottage in the white moon-glow, Like walls of marble with a roof of snow; The river and the lake, the wood, the hill; The same kind faces, with the same smile still; And ne'er so palpable, and ne'er so fast, Came thronging up the spirits of the past, Until he thought to see within the door His father's form, and hear his voice once more. Yet slow he rode adown the still retreat, As loth to reach what he had longed to meet. II.âTHE SOLDIER'S RETURN. A soldier came to the chamber of death, From the world and its noisy disdaining; His step he subdued, and he stifled his breath, And he fettered his heart's complaining. And the old man turned with an impulse of sight, Though dim with time's shadowing hoary: âWho stands by my bedside in silence and night, Between me and the night's silent glory?â âA strangerâa friendâhis day's wandering done, From the darkening world hither driven.â âNay! an thou art a friend â upon earth I have noneâ Thou must be some angel from heaven. âNay! tears on my hand? Those are earth's mournful dower. Now bless thee so kindly for weeping! For me none have wept since the sorrowful hour When she her last vigil was keeping. âWhy sobbing so wildly? What careth another That the dying is loving the dead? Ha! who but the son can weep thus for the mother Such tears by the father's deathbed? âBend lowerâbend lowerâthat yet I may trace With my poor hands the vision I cherished. Ah! it is not my bonny sweet child's smiling face. Speak!âquick!âhas the music too perished? âThy voiceâ'tis so kind!âso familiar appears, Yet so strange, like a child's harp restrung. Ye have left me the dear voice, ye ravishing years! Like the same song by ruder lips sung.â His dreamy thoughts came on the ebb of his breath, Like echoes from Eden-land flying, And a smile like the kiss of the angel of death, Too happy for aught but for dying. âAh! hark to my boy's voice, that sings by the stream, And his laugh as he bounds through the dell! Hush! hush! I am dreaming a sweet, quiet dream: Wait awhile, I shall wake and be well!â He lay there so still, and he lay there so white, Like a soldier from life's warfare sleeping, And so grand in the funeral pomp of the night, With silence his death-vigil keeping. They laid him with wailing, they laid him with tears, In the churchyard all quiet and lone:â The little birds sing the great song of the years, And the grasses have hidden the stone. III.âTHE COMING STORM. Upon the wane the summer stood, And coming autumn's shade Across the wild breeze-haunted wood In gold and purple played, Veiling the progress of decay With brighter, but with colder ray, As those who hide some deep distress Seem far more gay than happiness. There was a curse upon the land; Pale plague grasped famine's bony hand, And discontent began to reign, And single voices to complain, While moody brows showed here and there, And eyes that gloomed with more than care Began to lighten with despair; And heads, in anguish bowed, to rise Like threatening signs on silent skies, Fast challenging their destinies; And hands that had been raised in prayer, Unconscious half, began to feel In sleep for the forgotten steel; And those who, when their rulers passed, Stood cap in air, and eyes downcast, Now looked them darkly in the face, As claiming right, not seeking grace; And when, within the teeming street, Burgher and noble chanced to meet, The first forgot to step aside, And held his way with churlish pride. For 'twas the time when spirits wild Cried to the masses dream-beguiled, âRise for the causeâthe cause of man!â Earth's saturnalia then began. Then rose the mass, then led the few, But why nor led nor leader knew; They chose a cause, they seized a name, No matter which, 'twas all the same, So that it bore them onward straight Through tumult, death, and wrath, and hate, To scaffolds red, where they could slake The thirst their hearts must quench or break. Some led the way, like pilots sent, The wild time's wild embodiment, With something generous still and true: They fall 'neath the succeeding few That start from the chaotic strife, As breeds corruption its own life. This was the time when fierce delight, Like conflagration in dark night, Shook Guivro's ruthless heart of hate, Who watched the crisis-turn of fate; Far and secure, with icy hand Tossed on the pyre another brand, And with his breath insidious fauned, What time its fires were burning low, Afresh the deeply smouldering glow. For he had flown impending fate, And broken through his dungeon grate With all the strength of fear and hate, And, as he dashed his shattered chain, Had sworn, âI will return again!â He was forgotten by his foes. When sudden riots first arose In passing gusts, with gatherings scant, Men deemed them but the birth of want, And showered down gold, and portioned food, Among the hung'ring multitude; But, as they gave, arose more loud The clam'rous cravings of the crowd. In vain the pitying monarch shared The hoarded wealth through ages spared; Spread through that vast infinity, 'Twas like a wreck upon a seaâ As though ye'd lull a storm to sleep By sinking navies in the deep. Then, when the mass took head at length, Roused to the sense of its own strength, Their ruler, taught to fear the worst, Did what he should have done at firstâ Called forth the war-ban of the state, And smote when it had grown too late. For drunken age and maddened youth, Unbridled passion, strode at large, Battalions wavered in their truth, And leaders feared to bid them charge, Lest a refusal break in twain Obedience' last decaying chain. As yet the nobles in the land Had leagued not with the people's band; From king and rebel both aloof, They watched o'er discord's sable woof, Fast bright'ning, steal the crimson streak, Strength'ning themselves as both grew weak. IV.âTHE INSURRECTION. The people held the capital, Besieged the palace high, Riot beat on tower and wall, And like a fierce artillery Came from without the savage cry, Piercing through the stately hall, And through the echoing chambers all, More deeply wild, more strangely loud, As crowd was gathering fast on crowd. A sea of torches tossed by night, A sea of lances heaved by day; Like waves against an island height, Around, around, by day and night, High to their own wild tumult's gale, As to a breeze, they storm and scale, And backward dash, like scattered spray, In shivered flakes of shining mail; While burned the city like the torch That flames in hell's unsated porch, And rose the smoke a regal pall, Fit for an empire's funeral. Still from the castle's loftiest height Northward strained the monarch's sight, At evening dim, at morning clear, To see the expected succour near; But day by day was passed the same: Still watched heâstill no succour came; And shadowy rumours still were told Of disaffections fresh and bold. The king as yet, with conscious pride, Hurled the disordered onsets back, And laughed to scorn the threatened wrack. The unskilled mass, with none to guide, That might with one gigantic blow Have struck the tottering palace low, In cumbrous crowds tumultuous died Beneath the reeking rampart's side. But anxious grew his brow this day, When change came o'er their wild array; The masses took embattled form, The clouds were gathering for a storm, And order, like a mighty charm, Taught the fierce rebels how to arm. He knew the master hand had come, Upwaving fast the hour of doom, And in the changes wrought below Beheld the presence of his foe. With hurried step the castle-ward Unbidden stood before his lord: âSome evil's brewing from without. Hark to the fresh upgathering shout!â And deeply beat the sullen roar From wall to wall, from arch to floor; But strangely sweet a mellow clang Loud o'er the volumed voices sang, And silvery tone and glorious strain Thrilled through the listener's heart again. âUp to the rampart! for behold, That bright voice hath the rescue told! I know the clang my trumpets threw; I know the tread of my henchmen true!â The monarch sped to the rampart's height; And oh! it was a glorious sight. On, on it cameâthe bannered pride! The crowd gave way on every side, Fast flooding back, Like tempests black When parted by the sun-god's track. On, on it cameâa stream of gold, That with a tide of music rolled! Right on the palace held its wayâ Loud and more loud the war-notes playâ The very ramparts thrilled again, As though the stones stirred to the strain. Still, still they spread And glide below, With steady tread, As rivers go, And, as the waves gleam in the sun, Flames in the light their harness dun; Ranged in a long, firm, steely wall, The tall men with their lances tall; And the gushing floods of the riders stand Like frost at the sign of their leader's hand. Adown the ranks he gallops fleet, And shrill the stones to his courser's feet, And with him he hales in his quick career, Like a palpable thing, the long-following cheer; His bearing so stern, though his visor is down, That e'en through its steel ye can fathom his frown. Full proudly gleams the monarch's eye: âThey comeâmy own brave chivalry!â Loud from the walls the soldiers fling Their gallant cry, âFor God and King!â âGod for the People!â comes the roar, And silence sinks the answer o'er. Then from the line all slow of pace That stately leader rode amain, Flung back his visor from his face: âSir Guivro has returned again!â âFalse knights! in arms against your king? And headed by so foul a thing?â Against the glowing sunset came A flitting sheet of pallid flame, And faint-drawn streaks of thin grey smoke, Fast followed by the cannon-stroke, That on the castle rampart broke, And shook the chambers as it sped With sullen clang and shattering tread. â'Twas there Sir Guivro's answer spoke!â V.âTHE KING'S VIGIL. Night sank on that disastrous day, And light and hope died both away. No longer raged the noisy din, Without was silent as within, Save the repeated heavy tone, And the scant answer backward thrown, Where pealed the gun, and bore the ball Death's messages from mound to wall. Within his chamber lone the king Listed his empire's death knell ring: Then in his eye first gleamed a tear; Then in his heart first froze a fear. But not on his throne his glances rest, And royalty fills not his throbbing breast; His hand is not on his sceptre of gold, But it plays with the tress on his daughter's brow, And he wreathes round his fingers its long silken fold: The father was never a father till now. Disaster is teaching the stern heart to feel, As flame from the flint is but struck by the steel. Still and dovelike on his breast That gentle daughter drooping pressed; The fiery blast that upward rolled, Stirred along her forehead cold, Where haply, with the coming morrow, Death from her might beauty borrow. âOh! where are now the champions allâ The thousand swords in courtly hall? Oh! where are now the proud and high, That vowed for thee to live and die?â That savage shout gave stern reply, And heavy falls from the tottering tower Told of the step of the coming hour. Up starts the kingâ The night-guard callsâ His wild cries ring Through empty halls, And quick he paces on the walls, Beneath the artillery's thickening fire, Commands, entreats with weeping eyes, Until they think, in mute surprise, That fear has seized upon their king, Nor deemed, in their poor reckoning, `Twas not the kingâit was the sire! Then, when himself had ordered all, Placed every guard on every wall, He hurried back in pale unrest, And clasped his daughter to his breast, And forced a smile upon his cheek, And strove in cheerful tone to speak, And laughed as 'twere a merry thing When tower and mine went thundering. But as the hour was drawing nigh, Came empire to his troubled eye; And when the rest, whose spirits' power Had served them bravely to that hour, Began to vail their pallid cheek, Then he grew strong as they grew weak. The greatest heart will deepest feel, As easiest bends the purest steel; But soon grows calm, as 'twas before, The lofty thought, the tempered ore, Back trembling to itself again, Where baser metal breaks in twain. VI.âTHE SUCCOUR. A stir is at the palace gate, In the palace hall a cheer, And hurrying feet, with step elate, Sound hope's sweet music near. Why was it that a spirit new Seemed breathing that dark castle through? 'Twas that one face had dared to look Unshaken upon hearts that shook, And that one strong mind dared to speak Of their own strength to spirits weak, And from its own abundance gave The faith in safety that doth save. From far Corayda came that night, Like warrior true by his king to fight, When left defenceless, well-nigh lone, With but his sceptre and his throne. Wounded he found his secret way Through the loose leaguer's wild array. That evening erst the mighty crowd Had cast aloft their clamours loud, When Guivro brought his army proud. They came in strength, with trumpet tone, And showers of golden light; Corayda wounded, worn, and lone, In melancholy night. But greater powers reside in thought Than in the sword and spear: Ten thousand to the foeman brought Less joy than one man here. They led him proudly to his king, As though they had a host to bring. Dark grew the monarch's brow of pride; He had forgiven in brighter hour, But, when dominion left his side, Wilder he grasped the shade of power. Red anger lit his forehead stern: âWho bade the exile home return? And dare men beard me to my face?â Low knelt Corayda: âMonarch, grace! I ask but for a soldier's rightâ Death at thy feet in loyal fight.â Then fled the frown: it could not hold By the warm tear, that shadow cold! Oh! it had been a study strange To mark the monarch's glances change: Triumph's far temple seemed to ope At that one voice of whispered hope, With light, first clothed in seeming doubt, Where all had erst been light without. â'Twere vain,â he cried, âon hope to dwellâ They are so many, we so few. I taught them victory far too well To teach defeat's stern lesson too. But stillâay, still there is a chance, If timely yet the aid advance, Though weak, and farâah! far away, And ruin waits upon delay. I reck not! There's a mighty charm That rests within a sceptered arm: I mightâI still would win the day. But hark! Too late! Dost hear them come To the muffled curse of the muttering drum?â Then paled the garrison amain; None drew their swords, as though 'twere vain, And terror glared from every eye; When pealed aloud Corayda's cry, Like the first trumpet of a victory. âHo! bid the merry bugles blow. Who wears a sword and fears a foe? Give out the word, âLet traitors go!â And bid them all their false arms lend To storm the walls that we defend; And o'er them blaze the beacon-brand, That all may see them where they stand.â Aloud the merry bugles blow; Assault was gathering thick below, The storming column moving fast, The coming hour had proved the last, What time they heard that bugle blast, And saw the bale-fire o'er them glow: Then thought they, by that sudden cheer, Reserve or safety must be near, And straight from the defenceless wall Their trumpets sounded the recall. Another pause is snatched from strife, Another chance for death or life. VII.âTHE FATHER. The noon of night was well-nigh spent, When from the silent battlement The monarch for Corayda sent. âA guerdon for thy duty past, Thy greatest service, and thy last! Not such reward as can repay The vulgar herd of common clay; But I will overpay my due, And yet depart thy debtor too: Defend my daughter, and be true! âOne pathway still is unopposed. Flyâere the morrow sees it closed. Nay, answer not, young chivalry! Thou lovestâshe is safe with thee.â Swept anguish o'er Corayda's brow: âMy kingâmy king! fly thouâfly thou!â âNay, this old arm grows weak in strife; I trust it not with that dear life, Though fit enough to guard its own, And fight for baubles like a throne. But oh, my child!âCorayda, thine Is but poor love compared with mine.â He paused; and in that moment's space His heart seemed starting from his face, Then smiled again: âThe frontier past, My kinsman's court attained at last, Tell him your king knew how to die, But had not learned to yield or fly.â He moved with step still firm and proud, But gathered in his eyes the cloud; Ere half way he had reached the door, Oh! they were streaming, streaming o'er. He pausedâhe turnedâas struggled still Those mighty champions, heart and will; Then quick the broken accents fell, âOh, guard her well! oh, guard her well!â VIII.âTHE FLIGHT. Six hundred warriors strong and tall Are missing from the western wall, Forth marshalled by Corayda's hand, To guard the lady of the land. And haply chanced it they had leftâ That morn the mine the rampart reft; They heard the thunder on their flight, Like war's own shout of fierce delight, And o'er the coppice rough they viewed, Part in the rising of the wood, Part in the dazzling distance lost, A marching line as of a host; And then aloud a clangour rose, Like 'larums of encountering foes. They paused, half hoping. Suddenly Swelled faintly up the people's cry. â'Tis rebel succour! Speed the flight, For safety must be reached with night!â Wideâwide across the ravaged land Fierce swept insurgent band on band, Far scattering ruin as they went, Like hail-clouds over harvests sent; But clearly shone the morning light, The gallant train was glancing bright, Though carnage was all freshly dressed, And anguish bleeding in each breast; But failed the cheer and failed the song To time their lonely march along. It was not on the martial face Disaster showed its blighting trace; It was not on the furrowed cheek, But on the lip that could not speak; Not in the stern eyes darkening, But in the heart that could not sing. 'Tis song that cheers the soldier's life, 'Tis music stirs him on to strife: Be sure, when silent bands ye meet, They're passing from or to defeat. Through woodlands wild, that summer day, Their march untroubled won its way, With here and there warm ashes strewed, Where war had made fresh solitude. O'er varying shades of human woes How bright eternal nature rose! How glorious shone the lasting sun O'er fleeting war-clouds low and dun! How clear the woodland music ran Above the dim dark graves of man, As chanting down the living sky His soul's proud immortality! IX.âTHE BRIDLE-REIN. But in a world all, all their own, A thing from earth apart, Engirdled by love's magic zone, That melted heart in heart, Of garden sweet, of heather wild, Unconscious, onward strayed, So sad, so blessed, so dream-beguiled, Corayda and the maid. He walked beside her bridle-rein, And never a word spake he; The winds were singing on the plain, The birds sang on the tree. He gazed not once up to her face, But downward looked alway On the flowers that bent 'neath her palfrey's pace, Though far less fair were they. And he laid his arm on the palfrey's mane, And patted its neck where it glowed, And he held to his heart the trembling rein Of the steed that his lady-love rode. A gentle wind upsprang from the west, And waved in the silken flow; Oh! the eastern side was the side he loved best, And the angel of love was the angel he blessed, For it made that sweet breeze blow. He walked beside her bridle-rein, And never a word spake he; The winds were singing on the plain, The birds sang on the tree: But oh! dear love to youth and maid A sweeter music taughtâ The music that their own hearts played To the silence of their thought. X.âTHE RUINED FORT. And when the evening planet came, Afar a castle stood, Red tinted, like a beacon flame Above a twilight flood. And old trees rose all dark and still, No welcome in their look; Like sentinels from hill to hill, Their gaunt dim arms they shook. Whole woods had died away between Where these still braved the blast, But looked so old, they must have been The first as now the last, Left behind to bury low, With their few leaves sere and slow, Their generations past Sternly frowns the castle arch O'er the warriors' weary march; Thick the wet grass on the ground Muffles low the coursers' tread; The lichens trail the towers around, Like funeral weeds on mourners bound, Moistened with the tears they shed For their brave old glories dead. Stands the keep-tower dim and lone, Riven roof, and shattered stone, Like a great black skeleton; And thick along its rampart-side The rough holes that the cannon plied Gaped like wounds, of which it died. Waves no banner on the wall, But a pine tree, dark and tall, With stately crest its root has sent Athwart the broadest battlement. No warder from the watch-tower blows Friends to arms and scorn to foes, But the winds their clarions swell With a blast as loud and fell; No troopers mount in such brave haste, That plate and mail but half are braced; No sallying rush, no scaling din, But the storms sweep out, and the storms sweep in; And never, be sure, in their days most proud, Assault or sally were half so loud. Each turned his eyes from the lonely place, And fixed them on his neighbour's face; But showed each face so blank amain, They bent them for cheer on the ruins again. XI.âTHE NIGHTLY HALT. The sun has sunk, the guard is set, The foe seem distanced far as yet; With martial haste the wary band Place the defences to their hand, And arquebuse and culverin They range the batteried walls within. The morrow should herald their further flight, But the warder has taken his stand for the night. Still through the twilight strain his eyes, For spears along the distant rise; The night breeze waves the tree-top spires, The low clouds gleam like wandering fires; He bends his ear for the signal-blast, And curses the shadows that gather so fast, With phantoms of spearmen swift wandering past. Darkâdarker it grows where the hill is high: Now keep well the watch of the ear, not the eye! Not a torch be waved on the long rampart-side, Not a lamp be hung in the gateway wide, The friend to betray, and the foeman to guide. Ha! a light in the turret! 'Tis hurried away, And Amorine kneels in the darkness to pray. Weareth the watch. In the midnight profound Corayda is pacing the ramparts around. Is it the wind on the far forest beat, Crushing the leaves with invisible feet? Is it the stream that has risen and roars, Fretting and champing the rock of its shores, Claiming the mountains, not vales, for its strife, As a large spirit strives with the shackles of life? The warder thought it was the air: His raised hand met no motion there. He thought 'twas the mountain stream quickening by: That eve, when they passed it, the channel was dry. But when the third guess he had given, I trow, He spoke not a word, for he knew 'twas the foe. Onward came the solemn treading, Widening as it nearer drew, Like the stream its banks o'erspreading, Like the winds the forest threading Through, and through, and through. Count the thousands by the sound, By the time the thousands count, Striking numbers from the ground, Crossing still the highland bound, As they fall and as they mount. Hark! the cohort on the hill Casts a clangour passing shrill; Trampling through the forest's arch, Dulness wraps the lowland march. Still pass they, distant scarce a rood; Still ye hear them tread away; Still upgathering through the wood, Sweeps and swells the coming flood, Or ebbs the long array. Hark! Now and then a heavy groan, Where the wheels of iron drone, And cannon grate against the stone; And now and then a sudden clattering, Like rain-drops upon broad leaves pattering; And now and then a steely ringing, Like church-vanes in a tempest swinging; And now and then a murmur blending, Like locusts on a land descending; And now and then, from nearest band, A loud hoarse signal of command; But never a sound, and never a word, That passed the castle's guard unheard. They bent them o'er the rampart low, Their long guns pointed at the foe, Their matches burning pale and slow; And little knew the hosts beneath, Where, like a cloud poised on a breath, Hung o'er their heads the darkened death, All ready to come scattering hot, A mountain shower of lurid shot. Silentâsilent all they stand, Burning match 'neath covering hand. An hour has flownâthey breathe more bold, Yet undiscovered in their hold. But one short space, one half hour more, And the foe may pass, and the peril be o'er. A flash!âa sound! Who fired that shot? On wall or tower what careless hand Betrayed their unsuspected band? Fastâfast on the devoted spot Pours the loud answer fierce and hot, And straight the marching myriads stand. A pause. Along the hill-pass wide Runs the signal, strikes the halt, And either side Prepare to bide The brunt of sally or assault. In single shots, receding dies The volley of the first surprise, And ye can hear the rapid riding, Onward marching, and abiding; Firelocks charging, spear-heads fixing, Square and squadron intermixing, Cannon planting, column wheeling, Scout advancing, ambush stealing, While echo leaping, bound on bound, From hill to hill with the gathered sound, Shouts as ten hosts were circling round. Sudden on the gloom-wrapped wall Ran and leaped a fiery ball. Another and another came, Above, around, with vaulting flame. The battlements showed as in glaring of day, And faint fell the gleam on the hostile array, Revealing the column prepared to assail, And the black battle clouds still withholding their hail. Then belched forth together the carbine and gun, Like iron volcanoes their canopies dun, Swathing the red death, that flamingly broke From their mouths of hoarse thunder in volumes of smoke. But when not a sound, save of echo alone, From those time-ruined ramparts in answer was thrownâ When flashed not a flame, and when hissed not a ball, And not a defender was seen on the wall, But the breach, and the rent, and the wide portal arch Seemed to turn the assault to a battle-less marchâ Then burst the loud cheer Down the lengthened array, Now far and now near, As it flooded away; And then ye might hear The quick rush to assail, And the hand on the spear As it shrilled to the mail. They strained up the rise, and they climbed o'er the ridge, The feet of the foremost were beating the bridge: âNow fire!â As Corayda the stern signal gave, Saint's troth! but the echo that answered was brave! Blazed loophole and bastion, blazed turret and wall, Down thundered rent ruin, and foemen, and all; A shriek and a groan, that are lost in the din Of the sharp-ringing carbine and hoarse culverin; A rushing away and a beating of feet, And a trailing of limbs in the bleeding retreat; A sharp shot sent after To quicken their flight, Like a spasm of laughterâ Then darkness and night; A muttering of drums, then a trumpet-clang clear, As though pealing so loud lest the soldier should hear How the heart in his bosom was beating with fear; And deep pauses filled to o'erflowing with dread, Like long soundless requiems held for the dead. XII.âTHE SIEGE. Through morning's cold grey lips the breath Chased darkness from the brow of death. The ruin rose with more of gloom, Like some old violated tomb, And the dead-piled fosse, with its crimson ground, Gaped like a great wide wound around; While in a circle lengthened far, Brooded the lines of leaguering war; And to and fro, in many a road, Uptrampled tracks all redly showed Where the rivers of carnage had ebbed and flowed. But the morning wind came with its pure fresh breath, Like the spirit of life to the spirit of death, And shook the torn arms of a banner on high, Like strips of pale cloud that had dropped from the sky; And those who had looked to the far forest range, Albeit for some traces so passing and strange, Might have deemed 'twas a desert abandoned of man O'er which the wild breezes fresh pasturing ran. But when the leaguering army round it coiled, Saw what a ruin had its onset foiled, Clove through its waking orb a hollow laugh, Half self-derision, and defiance half; The batteries, that were smouldering till the morn, Withheld their salutations as in scorn, And but a single rider from them all Dashed through the circling legions to the wall. A smile was kindled on Sir Guivro's face, As up he reined, in distance scarce a pace From where the cannon peered athwart the gate With iron lips for oracles of fate. Safe from assault through martial honour's use, He called his deepest enmity a truce! No forms upon the crested wall are seen, But human shadows rest the rents between, And grate of steel and click of carbine tell The foe can fight again who fought so well. Scornful and loud Sir Guivro's challenge rung, But died âSurrender!â on his palsied tongue, When from the crumbled rampart cast below Corayda's shadow smote him like a blow. Terror and hate hung stifling on his breath: He knew âSurrender!â must be changed to âDeath!â But then he strove, with promised wealth and life, To win the soldiers from the useless strife, And tempt them to desert the chief who gave For battle, murderâfor a fort, a grave; Showed his wide host and their defenceless state, With scarce a weapon save despair and hate; How the orbed tempest hung on his one breath; How they were wrecked and islanded by death, Cast in his thrall with that defenceless maid, Who deepened but the vengeance she delayed. Once let a great heart breathe with daring plan The spirit of its greatness into man, Then lesser hearts begin to beat and boundâ The soil for flowers is hid in every groundâ And men will love the great for greatness' sake, If once ye bid their souls' deep music wake. As stones turn statues in the sculptor's hands, So hero-leaders make heroic bands; Thence thought they all, though theirs was not the cause, Like true men answering nature's golden laws: How can the warrior fear, the soldier yield, Beauty to serve, and innocence to shield? Girdle the leaguerâdraw its iron length; Her grief's our arm, her helplessness our strength; Let yonder hirelings fight, the brutish brave! They strike but to destroy, and we to save. Then burst from every lip the one-voiced cry, âGod for the right! up challenge to the sky; God for the right! and blessed are those who die.â âAnd think yeââbut Sir Guivro's lip was paleâ âThe riddled bark so long may ride the gale, Till comes the king, with fiery spur at heel, To sweep our lines away with waves of steel? Be undeceived! Now die, despairing hate! The king was slain before his palace gate.â Up from that gallant band, up burst the shout, As rung each heart its knell of anger out, âGod for the Queen!ââone answer, one from all! Pealed on the rising morn the solemn call: âNow forth, each sword of gentleman and knight; For nobles all who fight a noble fight. God for the Queen! Up, royal standard, high, That all may know the worthiest spot to die!â Up rushed that stately banner fold on fold, Baring to golden skies its shield of gold; O'er the black fort its sheeted light unfurled, As honour shines above a darkened world. What was it that subdued the soldiers' cheers, And brought to furrowed cheeks unbidden tears? The crown of sorrow on that young queen's brow Bowed heads the sceptred kings could never bow. The kindred heart, though rude in mail arrayed, Is gentle in the warrior as the maid. As light comes gliding on the morning air, She stole on the fresh silence like a prayer; Those ruins seemed an altar to heaven's King, Crowned with high hearts, earth's noblest offering; While, like a white uplifted flame, the maid With hands upraised in silent anguish prayed, Or one lone lily in some dark old wood, Where sternly ranged the circling soldiers stood. That fiery orb of living hearts around Sank as by some enchantment to the ground, And brightly shone from each uplifted eye The deep resolve for God and her to die. Then knew Sir Guivroâand his smile grew dimâ Who knelt to God would never kneel to him. The rapture in those glances flashing free, Taught him how proud a thing man's death can be; That life has greater aims than pomp and strife, And death itself may prove worth more than life. E'en in that moment of unchecked command He enviedâay, the meanest of that band; And half he cursed himselfâcould half prefer To leave his hosts, and come and die for her. So fair is virtue to the darkest sight! So God has doomed the wrong, and blessed the right. With spur and bit to maddest fury lashed, Hence â hence Sir Guivro's steed tumultuous dashed. Vain, vain to fly, or call thy strong array! The foe is in thy heart, they cannot slay. Whatever fate thine after arms may meet, Thou hast received thy worst and last defeat. XIII.âTHE RED ROSE. Fourteen long days had passed in storm and flame; And now the last, last evening slowly came. Now hope began to look with heavenward head, And memory count on beaded tears her dead: Five hundred hearts with pulses glory drivenâ Five hundred spirits leaning down from heaven No royal banner flapped the subject air, No hand had vailed it, yet it hung not there; Rapt by the fiery kiss of battle's blast, It waved o'er men unvanquished to the last. Sad on the shattered fort fell evening's smile, Gilding a dying empire's funeral pile; But still within the crumbling rampart's heap Their last defence the last defenders keep: That living ruin strikes and strives the same, Like heart unconquered in a conquered frame. A tower yet stands upon the western wall, The most exposed, although the last to fall; And strange to see, uninjured round it grows, With yet a single flower, a red queen rose: Facing the whirlwind, sweet as poet's song, Type how the beautiful survives the strong. Pale listened Amorine, that endless day, How on the ramparts died the cheers away; The crash, the shout, and the wild nameless din Became more loud without, more low within. It was not that the soldier proved less true, Or hearts grew weak, but that the hands waxed few. The sulphury smoke came sweeping round the tower, That rocked and reeled beneath the thundery shower; Yet never gazed she from that sad retreat, Dreading to see the death she dared to meet; But still at times, when lulled the eddying roar, Pale faces peered through the half-opened door, And wounded men would come with quiet smile, And tend her gently, dying all the while; Speak with a faltering tongue some word of cheer, Kiss her cold hand, and lingering disappear; And then anon, without, some faint voice cried. âGod for the Queen!ââand thus the brave hearts died. Through that long day Corayda never came But battle's voices chanted to his name; And well she knew, when clanged his knightly brand, There blazed the breach up with the leaguering band. The storm was scaling nearer from without, And died the answer to a single shout. She longed to greet him, but she feared it most, For he would come when all but he was lost. The sun is riding lowâthe walls are won; The unburied dead lie coldâthe strife is done. There rung the last cheerâthere the last sword smote: The fort's a tombstone to the deep grave-moat! One half hour more, the sun shall set, Whose lingering beams look proudly yet, Fronting the clouds that curdle nigh, Like a conquered chief who scorns to die Beneath the scowl of his foeman's eye. A vesper-bell swung on the air, Knelled o'er the clash the lull of prayer, A pause crept the loud leaguer through, And quiet sank on earth like dew; The slayers knelt above the slain Before they rose to slay again, When slow the turret-door swung back, Streamed through the arch the battle's wrack, And streaks of fire and sunny shine, Like death and glory, intertwine. Yet marked she, 'mid that sight of wail, One form alone, one forehead pale, That shone above the clouds of war With light immortal like a star. Still stood Corayda, as he came, With marble cheek, but eye of flame, His hand pressed slightly to his side. Was it the tumult of his heart to hide? Who broke the silence first, what sighs Upwafted slumbering destinies, What words were said, what thoughts had power, Rests with the angel of the hour. Back, back the wind the portal hurled, Closed, closed on the discordant world. Along the sun's red disc appear Black flecking lines of flag and spear. Vain hopeâvain hope! 'Tis but the sail Of vapours to the evening gale. Hark! The vesper chimes are done; Stands the chariot of the sun; His horses paw the western rise, Striking flashes from the skies. Hark! with slow and smothered roar, How the mounting murmurs soar! Shakes the tower beneath the blast: One moment and the worst is past. Hear they not, and heed they not, Lurid hell upboiling hot; And the clattering of the shot, And the crash from spot to spot, Hear they not, and heed they not? Lip to lip, and eye to eye, Raised to heaven before they die, Counting by their hearts' wild beating Moments rich as ages fleeting, Love remembered, life forgot'â Hear they not, and heed they not. Down from the mountains it sweeps like a gale, Up from the valleys it swells like a flood; The trumpet is driving the lance on the mail, As the hurricane scatters the arrowy hail On the leaves of the echoing wood. Does it not rouse them, the gathering and rout, And the storm that is pouring and clashing without? Why falls not the portal? Why comes not the foe? Why thunder above? and why silence below? Further and further, but loud and more loud, Like tempest receding with fresh-gathered cloud, The hosts are engaging on highland and moor: One hurried step only is nearing the door. Follows afar the deep, regular march, And a tall shadow falls through the red portal arch. Corayda's hand is on his blade, But fails the effort soon as made; His eyesight films, his senses ring: Kneel, kneel, Corayda!â'tis the king! False, false, Sir Guivro's tale of hate! One struggle brave at palace gate, One kingly fight on level plain, And those who were rebels are subjects again. The gallant succour came aright, 'Twas their advance Corayda saw When marching through the highland shaw. Then, when Sir Guivro learned the flight Of Amorine and the banished knight, And that unshaken in the north Leal barons led fresh lances forth, And even then were bearing near, He raised the siege in sudden fear, And with the best part of his force Straight tracked Corayda's woodland course, Sure, if the fugitives he take, His own triumphant terms to make; But purporting to strike the foe, Ere union could affect the blow. The brave are slain, who scorn to yield; The traitors sleep on lonely field; Faithless heart and lying tongue, Death unmourned and life unsung. Pealed the far-off triumph-sound, The lieges closed their King around; Low spake the father and the child, And oft the listening monarch smiled. Was it the sunset's crimson hue That faint blush o'er the maiden threw? No sunset e'er so brightly burned, When to the knight the monarch turned: âFor noblest knight the truest maid. The king the soldier's faith repaid; The father gives for the rescued child, A bright rose to thy laurels wild. Ambition gilds the warrior's sword, But love alone is love's reward.â Slow sank Corayda to his knee; It was a beauteous thing to see, The glory on his face that rose, Deepening, deepening evermore, Then passing like an angel o'er, And settling in a rapt repose. But once he spake, but once he smiled, As calmly as a dying child; Stole o'er his brow a saintly rest, And low he murmured, âBlest! O blest!â And lifted once his pallid face, Draped like marble with death's grace, And slow his arm began to glide Like shadow, powerless now to hide The death-wound at his gallant side. The maiden blushed, the maiden paled; The maiden turned, the glory failed! She never shrieked, nor swooned, nor fell; That fond heart passed without a knell. Sudden one long deep breath she drew, And one sad look, so piteous, threw, That every eye began to fill; Then sank beside him pale and still. Athwart her brow her fingers swept, As if she saw her flowing hair, Though not a tress was straying there; She took his hand, but never wept, And monumental silence kept. âAlas! my father!â Further word Than this, if spoken, was unheard. Is it the passing angel's tread, Or the dead that is whispering with the dead? The sun had gone behind the hill, That one rose drooped on the dewy sill; The wind that through the casement played Strewed its red leaves o'er the maid. Wild bursts without a joyous cheer, Conquering crowds are drawing near; The hosts defile, the clarions play, And glory lights the long array, And loud the notes of triumph ring, âLong life and gladness to the king!â Break at his feet the waves of steel, Before him knight and noble kneel; He fixed them long with vacant gaze, Dimmed with dreams of other days, Then murmured with averted sight, âOh, truest maid and noblest knight!â SCATTERINGS. THE BARD'S LAMENT. Spirit! why hast thou flown? Ethereal thought! Thou camest once like gush of ready flame, Wrapt on the currents that wild fancy fraught, Strong in a mighty melody untaught: Thou thing of fire! say, who so still and tame? Is this poor heart, thy whilom tenement, So worn that thou despisest there to stay? Has sorrow seamed my house with many a rent, Through which the world's cold storms their chill have sent, And scared my heavenly visitant away? Oh! still at times thy hovering form I trace, Thin wavering ghost, at fancy's fading feast: Re-cross the threshold of my dwelling-place, Where once thou camest, uninvited grace, And yet most welcome when expected least. Come back! I'll deck thy home with dainty pride: Its open doors thy fitful stay invite. Alas! 'tis but the ruin's portals wide, Through which the storms their dripping steeds may ride, But whose black arches scare the blest sunlight. In vain! Thy cold and dewy fingers play Across my heart-strings, yet they wake no sigh; The chords are broken, and the charm's away; Harp out of tune, and bard without a lay, The music's lost: then, lost musician, die! ON HEARING OF A POET'S DEATH. He's gone, 'tis said. Be still, false tongue! He's with us yet in what he sung. The earth has taken all it gaveâ His body to its hallowed grave; But heaven mourns its missing due, Since earth has kept his spirit too: And nature let him live so long, Her patriarch of modern song, Confessing, ages shall have flown Ere such another bard is known. HOPE. Gate that never wholly closes, Opening yet so oft in vain! Garden full of thorny roses! Roses fall, and thorns remain. Wayward lamp, with flickering lustre Shining far or shining near, Seldom words of truth revealing, Ever showing words of cheer. Promise-breaker, yet unfailing! Faithless flatterer! comrade true! Only friend, when traitor proven, Whom we always trust anew. Courtier strange, whom triumph frighteth, Flying far from pleasure's eye, Who by sorrow's side alighteth When all else are passing by. Syren singer! ever chanting Ditties new to burdens old; Precious stone the sages sought for, Turning everything to gold! True philosopher! imparting Comfort rich to spirits pained; Chider of proud triumph's madness, Pointing to the unattained! Timid warrior! Doubt, arising, Scares thee with the slightest breath. Matchless chief! who, fear despising, Tramples on the dart of death! O'er the grave, past Time's pursuing, Far thy flashing glory streams, Too unswerving, too resplendent, For a child of idle dreams. Still, life's fitful vigil keeping, Feed the flame and trim the light: Hope's the lamp I'll take for sleeping When I wish the world good night. EARTH'S BURDENS. âWhy groaning so, thou solid earth, Though sprightly summer cheers? Or is thine old heart dead to mirth? Or art thou bowed by years?â âNor am I cold to summer's prime, Nor knows my heart decay; Nor am I bowed by countless time, Thou atom of a day! âI loved to list when tree and tide Their gentle music made, And lightly on my sunny side To feel the plough and spade. âI loved to hold my liquid way Through floods of living light; To kiss the sun's bright hand by day. And count the stars by night. âI loved to hear the children's glee Around the cottage door, And peasant's song right merrily The glebe come ringing o'er. âBut man upon my back has rolled Such heavy loads of stone, I scarce can grow the harvest gold: 'Tis therefore that I groan. âAnd where the evening dew sank mild Upon my quiet breast, I feel the tear of the houseless child Break burning on my rest. âOh! where are all the hallowed sweets, The harmless joys I gave? The pavements of your sordid streets Are stoues o'er virtue's grave. âAnd thick and fast as autumn leaves My children drop awayâ A gathering of unripened sheaves By premature decay. âGaunt misery holds the cottage door, And olden honour's flown; And slaves are slavish more and more: 'Tis therefore that I groan.â THE SEA SHELL ON THE DESERT. Mournful murmurer, whence thy music, Singing chimes of distant seas? Constant harper, bard in exile, Come, translate thy rhapsodies. â'Mid the waters green I listed, Billows sing and oceans roar, And the flowing in the deepness, And the thunder on the shore. âFor in far back generations Here the tides majestic ran: Time's remorseless transmutations Dried them to a burning span. âAnd those boundless waters spurned me With their strong tempestuous hand; Great, and huge, and wild, they cast me Into exile on the strand. âBut the sea that bore me perished, With its million mighty waves; Sleeps the music that it cherished In their lone and arid graves. âMountains lofty shake their heather Where the depths of water flowed, And where coral paths were shining Winds the dry and dusty road. âYet the memory of those oceans, And the grandeur of their tone, I, the bard, whom they rejected, Cherish and record alone.â THE TREES. A young tree from the Apennine Was taken far away, And planted with the northern pine Beneath a colder day; Far severed from its parent stem, That now deserted grew, A sun-created southern gem, A child of fire and dew. The quick years rang their starry chime, The seasons fleeting sped, The lone child graced its northern clime, The southern tree lay dead. But oft at eve the autumn wind The living branches plays, Fresh whispering from that sunny grave Its melancholy lays. Oh, how the green boughs wave and stir! Oh, how the sere leaves fall! Cease, cease, most mournful messenger! Thus Time dissevers all. THE LAST LIGHT. Ah! the sun, the sun is setting, And the rocks are rimmed with gold; Darker yet the shades are getting In the whispering pine-wood old, And the fairy light is fleeting From the white sand on the shore, And the weary ebb is beating Faint retreat with muffled roar. Up the wreck the waves are leapingâ Tiny, mocking, impish crew! Children base their revel keeping O'er the foe their father slew; And the foul things, darkly winging, Dart from forth the hidden cleft; And of all the day was bringing, But the morrow's hope is left. Yet the spirit knows no fearing, Though its hour of joy hath been; Light without is disappearing: Kindle up, thou light within! THE WAYSIDE PORCH. A sinner on the highway passed; The sun lay burning on the blast, That sank beside him heavily, Like a wanderer worn as he. The dry dust rose and fell again, Like bitter thoughts in a fevered brain, That upward crowd, and whirl, and dart, Then sink all arid on the heart. He cast a frown at the burning sun: âOh, would my wandering were done!â He saw a porch beside him tower, Fresh with shade at noontide hour; Awhile on the threshold he sat him to rest, And the porch, and the builder who built it, he blest. Scarce had that blessing been breathed ere a change Came o'er his spirit, all wondrous and strange, And a voice was heard from the pile within, Like an angel-call to the child of sin. Was it lute, was it lyre, that with breath or with string Made music, like spirits in heaven that sing? His brow it grew cool, his heart lightened the while, As slowly he turned through the porch to the pile. Blest is the spot, 'tis so shady and still, A shelter at noontide, a rest on the hill! And he bent him in thought and in gratitude thereâ His thought was repentance, his gratitude prayer. In a cool spot of slumber he laid him to rest, He woke not again, but his slumber was blest. O ye who toil on o'er the wild desert way, The gate standeth openâgo, enter and pray! THE FACTORY CHILD. The factory child went on its way All weary and repining: Oh! brightly with the summer day Both heaven and earth were shining; And it thought how sweet it were to play 'Mid the flowers and corn and new-mown hay, And the bowery bushes twining. The town was hot with a furnace heat, And the sky was dark with smoke, But a wood wind came down the narrow street, And again it thought, âHow sweet, how sweet Where the daisies grow, and the waters fleet From the mill-wheel's whirling stroke!â But it heard its mother's voice behind Rebuking its sad delay, For the bell had ceased; and sorrow blind, It thought how the laggard was punished and fined, Of the heavy task and the home unkind, And the hot, close, hungry day. But the angel of death had touched the child, And she felt the longing for flight; And the light of her eye became more wild, And the hue of her cheek more bright. And onward, and onward, through alley and street, Unconscious and eager she trod, While her heart kept time to the fall of her feet, For 'twas flying from man to God. And soon the houses were waxing few, Clear shone the morning air, And the dust was slaked with a shower of dew, And a dwarfish tree with a fresher hue Was scattered here and there. And soon the space began to expand By the road on either sideâ At first in a track of garden-land, And then the corn-fields, green and grand, Were stretching far and wide. And the hillsâthe pleasant and smiling hillsâ Rose up in a mighty line; And the singing birds, and the singing rills, And the bees in the dazzling daffodils, And the breath that the depth of the woodland fills, Made melody divine. At noon, through the breezy upland glade, She reached a far-seen heightâ Oh! blest was the air that round it played, And the coppice waved and the corn-fields swayedâ Till the distant town like a spot was laid On the disc of their emerald light. And weary she sank in that green retreat On the fresh, cool, dewy sod, Till she heard through the hush of the noonday heat, Like the music of dreams in her slumber sweet, The fall of the passing angels' feet Who gather the flowers of God. They will miss her not in the factory town, Though vainly the bell shall ring; They are busy treading such young hearts down: What to them is so small a thing? And the pitiless mother shall think with a frown Of the earnings she used to bring; But the angels of God have prepared her a crown At the throne of eternity's King. TOO SOON. 'Mid the glories of youth's garden-land I gathered a garland of flowers, And bound them all in a band Of pleasure's and hope's golden hours. I gathered them fair and bright, And wore them a short sunny day; Overpowered at length with delight, In oblivious slumber I lay. I awokeâand I clasped them again; But ah! all their beauty was o'er; And I sought for a fresh wreath in vain: I could meet with those flowers no more. Alas! I had gathered them all Ere blest by their bright summer noon; Nor could I their freshness recall: I had gathered my garland too soon. Ah! had I but left them to bloom, Nor ravished them all without ruth, They had brightened the grass of my tomb, As they gladdened the path of my youth. TOO LATE. O! rich was the wild parterre, And gay was the garden-land; The hopes of my heart were there, Planted by youth's fond hand. I tended them through long years, I gave them my golden past: Were they watered with precious tears To be killed by a frost at last? Then why let the bright buds cling Till winter his spoil has won? Takeâtake thy rose in the spring, For the autumn will leave thee none. WHERE? Where is Love? O! rather name the spot Where Love is not: Below, above, In calm and storm, in wild and city martâ Wherever beats a human heart, There is Love! Even where Hate's red woof is seen Love weaves a golden thread between. In the battle's bleeding mass? He lurks beneath the wet cuirass, Breathed with earliest breathâ He dies not even in death. In the grave? The ring he gave, The lock of hairâ Love, Love is there! The mourner's thought dives down deep, deep, And the waking dream fathoms the dreamless sleep. No heart so withered, lost, and old, No thing so dull, and dead, and cold, But love compels in his boundless fold. He floats on the waves as they lean to the light Of the unseen moon in the darkest night; He dwells in the bud of the wet, green leaf, He lurks in the seed of the long-dried sheaf; He climbs into heaven, he dives into hell; He sits on the thrones where the angels dwell; He walks through the haunts of the souls that fell: For what can madden the anguished mind Like a glimpse of the heaven it left behind? O torture most exquisiteâjoy most divine! Thine is earthâthine is heavenâall creation is thine! WHAT? What is love? It is the striving Of two spirits to be one; Sweetness hungering after sweetness; Want that thirsteth for completeness; Planets twain decreed to be Each other's dear necessity, Each from each its light deriving, Till they melt into a sun. TO HER. To love, and to love hopelessly, It is a bitter lot! Not the idle love that parts, Light as it comes, from fireless hearts, Felt and remembered not! But love so deep that it must be An agony or ecstasy. Not the poor cold feeling, child To sickly sentiment, Whose fitful course is swiftly run, But flame as wild As comet sent Athwart a burning firmament, Yet lasting as a sun. And could I fly away, away, O'er land and main, in search of rest, Were I more blest? For day by day I am constrained that form of heaven to see; Hear the soft sigh Breathed low, but not for me. Ah! and how could it be? Thisâthis is agony! Yet could I fly away, away, Far as the bounds of night and day, Where mortal eye doth cease to see, Still would thine image present be; Presentâsurpassing as thou artâ As though I'd eyes within my heart, To which earth's barriers are unknown, Born to gaze on thee, and gaze on thee alone. What torture like to this hath man e'er given? A dying martyr, but who hopes no heaven; No solace for my heartâno guerdon for my pain; But ever doomed to love, and ever thus in vain. AGATHA. Like yon star that hangs lone in the desert of space, An oasis of light 'mid the dark of its blue, With the clouds of the gloomy night near on its trace, And the glow of its brightness half dimmed by their hue; Like yon lonely star, my beloved one! I found thee, Shining alone 'mid the deserts of earth, While the cold and the vain threw a dark cloud around thee, And dimmed with its shadow the light of thy birth. But thou art all goodness, and pureness, and love; Whatever the lineage by which thou art known, The Sire of thy heart and thy soul is above, And from Him I receive thee and make thee mine own. MINE. She's mine! Down, earth, beneath me, Too heavy for my tread! Sunshine, be my raiment; Ether, be my bed; Glory, be my banquet; Music, be my wine! Hear it, earth and heaven: She's mineâmineâmine! VILLAGE COURTSHIP. Green Lyndale was merry at sweet eventide, When the rough sounds of labour grew mute, And nature lay decked like humanity's birde With her dowry of harvest and fruit; When the soft shadows smoothed the harsh face of the earth, And the sunbeams danced o'er it like glances of mirth; And the still dew arose like the ghost of a shower, And the nightingale chanted the prayer for the hour. The peasant, returning the greenland along, Translated the wisdom of toil into song; His wife through the lattice trilled home-ditties sweet, And came down the passage the pat of small feet. But young eyes are watchful, and young hearts will roam: The house dog has given a short cheery bark, And the village maid knows that her sweetheart has comeâ As true as the dove, and as light as the lark. Why tarries the lad where the white willows play At hide and at seek with the light of the day? Why wanders the lass where the white willows' shade Is thrown like a veil o'er the modest-eyed maid? They met by the hillside, they met by the dell, Whatever they said there was still more to tell, Till they met far too often, and loved far too well. There's sorrow and sighing, And parents denying, And love that is wilful, and will have a way; There's meeting and flying, And secret allying, And husband and wife on some bright summer day. O willows of Lyndale! now blest be your shade, For there love is love, and not barter and trade; There flowers still are cherished, and songs still are sung, And no hearts are old that have never been young. THE LORDS OF ITALY. I. All in silence mounts the lava Through its veins of red-hot ore; All in silence lightnings gather Round the mountain's glaciers hoar. Weight on weight, and all in silence, Swells the avalanche's snow, Till a scarce-heard whisper hurls it Crushing on the world below. Drop by drop, and all in silence, Up the mound the waters creep, Till away in night and darkness Down the o'erweighted barriers sweep. O! the hamlet slept securely; But it woke not from its sleep. II. Dream ye not, on flowers reposing, 'Mid the grasses fresh and sweet, Of the hell beneath you raging, Rushing upward to your feet? See ye not, through haze of summer, Thin and calm above ye spread, Yon red hand, that, high in heaven, Aims already at your head? Hear ye not those sullen murmurs From the great volcano's breast, Like a heart within it beating, With an anger scarce repressedâ Like thy fiery heart, Italia, Bursting from its slavish rest? III. Silent as the snowflake sinking, Truth on truth keeps gathering strong, As the nations turn to thinkingâ Thinking of their right and wrong; Thoughts that make the bravo tremble, Thoughts that make the despot flee; For the thinker may be fettered, But the thought itself goes free. Thus, 'mid long historic pauses, Times will come with great events, Like the deluge-tides returning On decaying continents, Sweeping worn-out wrongs before them, Wrecks, and wrongs, and discontents. THE LAST BATTLE. The war-steeds are trampling, the bayonets are bare, And the banners of battle are red in the air: Hurrah! There flashes the flame, and there circles the smoke, And the army awakes at the loud cannon-stroke: âNow rise to your duty, and march man by man, And ruin, and slaughter, and crush all you can. Hurrah! For this is the glory of war.â There bends the long host in its scarlet array, Far stretching its deluge of glitter away; Hurrah! The cuirass and helmet are flaring in light: By heaven! but it is a magnificent sight, As battalion and squadron are moving amain To the battery's song and the brazen strain. Hurrah! For this is the beauty of war. And opposite, sullen, and shadowy, and vast, Stand masterless, motionless multitudes massed: Hurrah! One shudder there crept through that great living wedge, As the first flame broke from the battery's edge; Then all was steady and still as death, And million lungs drew one long breath. Hurrah! For this is the moment of war. Anon you might note the long streaky lanes dart, Where the shot drove right through the multitude's heart: Hurrah! And a sudden pit dug in that human floor, Where the shell dropped downward, and burst, and tore; And the shrieking here, and the booming there, With a hell on the earth and a hell in the air: Hurrah! For this is the music of war. They stood their ground for a time like men; Where a rent was made it was closed up again: Hurrah! But every moment more thick and fell Came the arrowy sleet of the shot and shell, And heads were turned backward, and cries grew loud, And they swept away like a great black cloud. Hurrah! For this is the panic of war. Then at once all the thousand battalions enlarge, As that army pours down its magnificent charge: Hurrah! And the fugitives stand in their panic aghast, Like stubble mown down by the great kingly blast. Wild bursts the loud cheer â but destroyers, beware! Here cometh that leader of leadersâDespair! Hurrah! For this is the crisis of war. And the people are turning and standing at bay Behind ramparts of deadâa brave garrison they: Hurrah! Now, courtier, your plumes should be wings in your need! And, knight of St. George, give the spurs to your steed! Your bright silken bravery scatters the plain, Like gossamers strewn by the round summer rain. Hurrah! For this is the triumph of war. At the close of the day, when the tempest was laid, Great masses were moving about in the shade: Hurrah! And broke o'er the field a broad deluge of light, And a thunder was thrown on the pause of the night: They clanged all their cannon, and prophets were they Of ages of peace beneath Liberty's sway. Hurrah! For that was the ending of war. NEW YEAR'S MORN. Morning flowed o'er the endless sea Like a march of spirits bright, Till the foam was turned to a silver smoke, And the wave to a waving light. And forth from the ball of the cloven sun The new year gaily came, A shining bark with sails of white, A swan of snowy flame. And ever as the strong ship passed Athwart that boundless main, It bore what was saved from the wreck of the last, To be wrecked in the tempest again. But time, he smiled Like a new-born child, Heart beguiled With roses wild, And his hand he doth lay on the helm like a ray, And steers out to sea as he chants alway: âPassions! ye warriors, the proud heart assaulting; Thoughts! ye wild eagles, that ride the cloud's are: Fears! ye black shadows from hell upward vaulting; Hopes! ye sweet nightingales heard in the darkâ Mount, millions! mount on the new year's bark!â And forth from air, earth, sky, and ocean, they came, Dewdrop and sunbeam, and shadow and flame. Then sang the waves with a trumpet tone, And danced to their own wild lay; And the stars they shaded their golden eyes With the mist of the rising spray. The blushing clouds o'er the ether driven, Sailed on a sunlight tide; And the morning wind gathered those roses of heaven, And scattered them near and wide. PERCY VERE: A DAY OF YOUTH. I.âLEAVING HOME. It was a day of autumn weather, The sleeting mists clung low together, And heavy clouds of leaden hue Strangled the wolfish winds, that blew The sere leaves from the branches bare, And sent them on the shadowed air, Like tiny biers to bear away The summer fairies, dead as they. Alone across the world to roam, That day I left my early home; Long it had been darkening round me, Lonelier still my childhood grew; Broke the fairy links that bound me, Dearer in becoming few. It was a solace to my mood When at the door the chariot stood, And that at least, with quickened breast, I could be stirring like the rest. How oft the mind, to musing prone, From nature takes a deeper tone, And passing nothings, frail and slight, Subdue a hero's heart of might: Last nightingales on springtide eves, Pale skies when summer's swallow leaves, First falling leaf, last fading flower, Small things that have a giant's power. Thus one slight scene, with touch subdued, Broke all my brazen strength of mood; Fast as the mansion died away Behind the scud's upbillowing spray, The woods, and, verging on the wood, The grand old trees, that singly stood Each in its own ancestral place, Like living scutcheons of our race: I passed a nook of sunny ground, By quiet woodland fenced around, Save where you saw, 'mid groupings dark, One turn of road divide the park, And distant villages, where ope Long vistas like a telescope. This, though remote, my childhood's care Had stocked with flowers of beauty rare, Yet simple things, of native birth, Like sunbeams rooted in the earth. There oft, when sunset's transient glows Cast phantom roses on the rose, O'er life's strange tissue fancy wrought The rich embroideries of thought. As down the winding drive I hied, The gate swung negligently wide, And one by one the gathering wind Sent those pale ghosts of leaves behind. The storms were busy with the flowersâ My thoughts were with the stormless hoursâ Neglect could never speak more plainly, Regret could never sigh more vainly. The past my heart came rushing o'er, Strong waves upon a hardened shore, That as they beat but harden more. I well-nigh weptâdeceiving pride The honest tear imperious dried. False wisdom, call it folly now, Chilled my vain heart, to smooth my brow: O triumphs of the ruthless years, I'd give you all to weep those tears! II.âTHE EVENING'S JOURNEY. It cleared towards the afternoon: The clouds in broken scud withdrew, Like squadrons routed in a fight, Before the north wind's lances light, And o'er them waved heaven's banner blue; While pale and tremulous the moon, Like a far trophy shining through, Or victory, dimmed by a regret, Above the sun's declining, set. The rain-drops glittered on the grass, Each like a fairy's looking-glass; The freshened breeze, with cutting edge, Mowed hissing through the river's sedge, And ringing sharp, the horses' bound Struck brittle music from the ground; Steamed from their gallant hearts the breath, Toil's incense at the shrine of death; While o'er the clouded windows fast The peopled panoramas passed. 'Mid clustering roofs, and tree-tops higher, Showed here and there the village spire, Up ambery skies obscurely driven, Like landmarks parting earth from heaven. Meanwhile the lines from hill to hill Across the plains were lengthening still. Though on we travelled fast and free, Those shadows travelled fast as we, Till where the road an angle turned, And full in front the sunset burned, There lay a hamlet on a hill, Like some sweet painting, warm and still; A calm lake nestled at its base, Flushed with the evening's golden grace, Like slumber on an infant's face. There life with gentler pulses stirred, And lowest sounds of loving rest Heaved o'er the heather's breathing breast. The cawing rookâthe lowing herdâ The airy music that the bell Shook from its deep wind-haunted cellâ The homeward carol, coarse and strong, By distance softened into song, Came melting through the mellow sky In melancholy melody. A fine old mansion on the height, Fretted with day's departing light To rich mosaic, grey and bright, With vanes of gold, and forests old In belted blackness round it rolled, Telling the tales of times gone by, Preached down its great, still homily. Afar, a vast dank city lay, With dome of smoke and cone of light, All black by day and red by night, A reeking mass of steaming clay, Where furnace chimneys mock the spire, Churches rise high, but factories higher, And fetid throngs, with constant flow, Through narrow streets hard-thoughted go. And on the horizon, further still, What if you mount the castle hill, Far as you stretch the aching eye, A large wild tract you may descry. A mist hangs over it by day, A thick, cold mist of bluish grey; But furnace flames at night arise, And there the dreary hell-land lies, Like some doomed world's uneasy hearse, For on it broods wealth's withering curse. It is a coal-field rich to till, By avarice unexhausted still, But all the wealth within its bound Sin holds like treasure under ground, Snake-guarded in a goblin tale. O! who can look on that black vale, And think of faces pleasure dight, All clustering round the home hearth's light, Like warm stars round a planet bright, And all the loving hopes that save Our kind affections, gently dear, When Christmas consecrates the grave That is to hold the dying yearâ O! who can think of these, and mark That spot where sunshine's self is dark? E'en this one scene, so near the waste That avarice made, and vice disgraced, With all its tranquil beauties, told It might beâfairer notâmore bright, And that the blight around it rolled Was faintly shadowed on its light; For something of neglect was there, And something of too still an air; And thus amid its woods it clung Like some sweet poet-song half sung. As down the winding hills I swept, Where the road's every turning kept Fresh masks, but all of pleasing grace, To suit the scene's expressive face, And a small wood path wandering o'er, Seemed, half concealed, to lure the more, I bade the noisy chariot stay, And silent went the quiet way. The leafy trees closed thickly round, As though beneath their cover bound They veiled some secret newly found; They swayed their slender, sunlit spires Like fibrous films of flitting fires, And all their leaves from crest to bole Trembled, as thrilling with a soul; While whispers soft sank circling round, As unsubstantial ghosts of sound, That died afar on field and flood, And won this paradise of wood. Now like a sigh the swelling west Rose from the clouds on evening's breast, And fresh beneath his toning pace Awoke the music of the place: The solemn beech the pauses filled, The anthem through the linden thrilled, The rougher harping of the oak The gliding notes to quavers broke, And all the scattered drops, commingling, Poured on the fir's sharp needles tingling, Till 'mid the willow's mournful play The lengthened cadence died away, And o'er the fairies' moss cairns grey The brown pine tassels sounded knells In carillons of forest bells. The autumn day's long labours ending, The village folk were homeward wending. Well might ye tell their age and state By rapid walk or slouching gait, Firm tread and independent swing, Or poacher-like meandering; The delicate, mincing, tripping pace Of stocking white, and black cross-lace; Or weaker, hesitating tread Of pale mechanic, city bred, Who started on a fieldward stroll Some moment when he felt a soul; The sturdy yeoman, statue-footed, As though each step to earth were rooted; Or the hired tiller of the sod, Who smote the ground on which he trod, That unto others luxuries gaveâ To him, life, toil, want, death, a grave. III.âTHE PASTOR'S FIRESIDE. The meadow track, through windings wide, Had led me to a garden side. The path well trodden, hard and bare, Showed many had been welcomed there. A wicket gate, a hedge of green, A thatched roof, through thick branches seen; Bright buds, as though the summer rain Had bathed them with the sunbow's stain; And, bending o'er the borders gay, A Titian head all silvery grey, An old man rearing those frail flowers, Like Time, the hope of childish hours; A laughing spirit at his side, All morning-faced and evening-eyed (For on her cheek morn's roses play, Sleeps in her eyes sweet evening's grey)â The weary world's young traveller greet, At that old pastor's calm retreat. Clung to his side his beauteous child, Like some sweet angel earth-beguiled; Pure pleasure sparkled in her mien, And love lurked in those eyes serene, And pensive peeped their modest fringe between; While varying hues of equal grace Threw lights of heaven across her face, And there in rapid changes wrought A rich romance of joyous thought. A greeting calm, but kind and warm, A lull of heart, a nameless charmâ These made me feel all home allied At that grey pastor's still fireside. The iron years, that furrowing flew, Dealt with the gentle gently too; For still, as drive their shares along, They mould the mild, but tear the strong. And they had spared that pastor old, Whom time made calm, but turned not cold, And bent him o'er life's fading page, As 'twere with prayer, and not with age; And, while they thinned the failing frame, Revealed the soul's immortal flame, Forth shining through its house of clay, As glory gilds our life's decay. Thus doth the long-maturing fruit Sun-ripened drop, though winds be mute, From no bleak bough untimely riven, But perfected by light from heaven. In every feature plainly wrought The promptings of the holy thought; And, when 'twas raised, his voice beguiled As music soothes a wayward child. He never spoke in angry tone, Screened others' faults, but not his own, Nor clashed in zealâmistaken guide!â With the hot arms of inward pride; His wiser words, that mildly ran, Rebuked the sin, but spared the man; Ne'er made of sanctity display, Thus over-gilding common clay; But 'twas the under-feeling, welling From that pure heart where truth was dwelling, The look, the voice, the example given, That, suiting earth, thence suited heaven. Of all-day themes he kindly heard, And warned as with a casual word, Laughed with the gay, yet ne'er o'erstepped The bounds by hallowed gladness kept; But when the Sunday bells aloft Poured forth their salutations soft, Then warmed his heartâhis glance bespoke The inspiration that awoke. Hisâhis was not the listless tone, Nor languid form, like preaching stone, The glowing prayer, but deadened eye, While lips say yes, but looks deny. Nor rhetoric's aid, nor priestcraft's art, Curbed the full ardours of his heart, But praying age and listening youth Felt the simplicity of truth; And all, by no vain show deceived, Believed him, because he believed.
