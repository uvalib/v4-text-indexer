Come shepheard swaynes that wont to heare me sing] Come shepheard swaynes that wont to heare me sing Come shepheard swaynes that wont to heare me sing, Now sigh and groane, Dead is my loue my hope, my ioy, my spring, Dead, dead &amp; gone, dead is my loue, my hope, my ioy, my spring, O she that was your summers Queen your dayes delight, is gone and will no more be seene, O cruell spight, Breake all your Pipes that wont to sound with pleasant cheere, And cast your selues vpon the ground to waile my deere, to waile my deere, Come shepheard swaynes, Come Nimphs and all a roe, Come Nimphs and all a roe, to help me cry, Dead is my loue, Dead is my loue, And seeing she is so, loe now I dye, loe now I dye. [II. Flourish ye hillockes] Flourish ye hillockes set with fragrant flowers Flourish ye hillockes set with fragrant flowers, So graced with her deity, whose eyes bedew you with their pearled showers, whose eyes bedew you with their pearled showers bewayling loues impiety. Happy yee are, be prodigall disposed, disdaine not loues lamenting, Let me, but kisse those steps, those steps where she reposed, to ease my harts tormenting, to ease my harts tormenting, then while she flyes me, here I lye and languish, sounding my sorrowes, sorrowes, tun'd in notes of anguish. tun'd in notes, tun'd in notes, of anguish. [III. Ah, cruell Amarillis] Ah, cruell Amarillis Ah, cruell Amarillis, since thou takst delight, to heare the accents of a dolefull dittie, dittie, of a dolefull dittie, To triumph, still without remorse or pittie, I loath this life, Death must my sorrowes right, And least vaine hope, my miseries renue, Come quickly death, reaue me of breath, (Ah) cruell Amarillis, Cruell Amarillis, Amarillis, cruell Amarillis, cruell adew, adew. [IIII. So light is loue] So light is loue, in matchles beautie shining So light is loue, in matchles beautie shining, So light is loue in matchles beautie shining, When she reuisits Cypris hallowed bowers, Two feeble doues harnest in silken twining, harnest in silken twining, can draw her Chariot midst the Paphian flowers, can draw her Chariot midst the Paphian flowers, Lightnes to loue, how ill it fitteth? Lightnesse to loue how ill it fitteth? lightnesse to loue, lightnesse to loue how ill it sitteth? so heauie on my hart she sitteth. Lightnes to loue how ill it fitteth? lightnes to loue, how ill it fitteth? lightnes to loue, how ill it fitteth? so heauy on my hart, (O) on my hart she sitteth. [V. As faire as morne] As faire as morne, as fresh as May As faire as morne, as fresh as May, A pretty grace in saying nay, Smil'st thou sweet hart? then sing and say, Ta na na no, Ta na na na, &amp;c. But (O) that loue inchanting eye, Loe here my doubtful doome I try, But (O) that loue enchanting eye, Loe here my doubtfull doome I try, my doubtfull doome I try. Tell me my sweet, liue I or dye? Tell me my sweet, liue I or dye? She smiles, Fa la la, &amp;c. Ah, she frownes, Aye me, Aye me I dye, I dye. [VI. O what shall I doe] O what shall I doe, or whether shall I turne me? O what shall I doe, or whether shall I turne me? Shall I make vnto her eyes? O no they'l burn me, Shall I seale vp my eies &amp; speak my part? then in a floud of tears, I drown my hart, for tears being stopt will swel, wil swel, will swel for scope, though they o'reflow, loue, life, and hope, By beauties eye Ile chuse to dye. At thy feet I fall fayre Creature, rich in beautie, And for pitty call, for pittie call, O kill not loue and duty, Let thy smooth tongue fanne on my sence thy breath, to stay thine eies from burning me to death. But if mercy be exiled from a thing so fayre compiled, [VII. I Liue, and yet me thinks I doe not breath] I liue, and yet me thinks I doe not breath I liue, and yet me thinks I doe not breath; and yet me thinks I do not breath; I thirst, and drinke; I drinke and thirst againe; I sleep &amp; yet I dreame I am awake; I hope for that I haue; I haue and want, I sing &amp; sigh; I loue and hate at once, I sing and sigh, I loue and hate at once. O tell me restlesse soule, What vncouth iarre doth cause such want in store? doth cause such want in store, in peace such warre? Doth cause such want in store, in peace such warre? then patiently by thee Ile dye. Ile dye. [VIII. There is a iewell] Risposta. There is a iewell There is a iewell, there is a iewell which no Indian mines can buy, no Chimick art can counterfait, It makes men rich in greatest pouertie, It makes men rich, it makes men rich in greatest pouertie, in greatest pouertie; Makes water wine; turnes wooden cups to gould; makes water wine, turnes wooden cups to gould, The homely whistle, to sweet musicks straine, the homely whistle, the homely whistle, to sweet musicks straine, Seldome it comes to few from heauen sent, seldome it comes, to few from heauen sent, That much in little all in naught. Here endeth the songs of 3. parts. Of 4. voc. [IX. When Cloris heard of her Amintas dying] When Cloris heard of her Amintas dying When Cloris heard of her Amintas dying, She grieued, she griued then for her vnkinde denying, Oft sighing, oft sighing, oft sighing sore and with a hart vnfayned, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye, I dye she thus complayned, Whom when Amintas spyed, then both for ioy out cryed, I loue, I loue sweet Cloris eye, And I Amintas till I dye, [X. Happy streames whose trembling fall] Happy streames whose trembling fall Happy streames whose trembling fall, with still murmure softly glyding, Happy Birds whose chirping call, with sweet melody delighting, Hath mou'd her flintie and relentlesse hart, to listen to your harmony, your harmony, inchanted with your melody, your melody, Sing on and carroll forth your glee, sing on, sing on, She graunts you leaue, her rayes to see, She graunts you leaue, her rayes to see, Happy were I, were I, happy were I, were I, could loue but so delight her, But aye alas, my loue doth still despight her. But aye alas, alas my loue doth still despight her. [XI. Change me O heauens] Change me O heauens, into the Ruby stone Change me O heauens, into the Ruby stone, That on my Loues faire locks doth hang in gold, that on my Loues faire locks, that on my Loues faire locks doth hang in gold, Yet leaue me speech to her to make my moane, yet leaue me speech to her to make my moane, to make my moan, to her to make my moane, And giue me eies her beauties to behold, and giue me eyes, and give me eyes her beauties to behold, or if you will not make, my flesh a stone, make her hard heart seeme flesh, that now seems none. make her hard heart seem flesh, that now seems none. make her, make her hard hart seem flesh that now seemes none. [XII. Loue not me for comely grace] Loue not me for comely grace Loue not me for comely grace, for my pleasing eye or face; Nor for any outward part, No, nor for my constant heart: For those may faile, those may faile, for those may faile or turne to ill, So thou and I shall seuer: Keepe therfore a true womans eye, keepe therefore a true womans eye, keepe therefore a true womans eye, And loue me still, but know not why; And loue me still, but know not why, but know not why, And loue me still but know not why, So hast thou the same reason still, to dote vpon me euer. to dote, vpon me euer. [XIII. Flye not so swift] Flye not so swift my deere, behold me dying Flye not so swift my deere, behold me dying, If not a smiling glance, a smiling glance, If not a smiling glance for all my crying, Yet kill me with thy frownes: The Satyres o're the lawnes full nimbly dauncing, Friske it apace, apace, to view thy beauties glancing, Thy beauties glancing; See how they coast the downes, See how they coast the downes, Fayne wouldst thou turne and yeeld them their delight, faine wouldst thou turne, and yeeld them their delight, faine wouldst thou turne, fayne wouldst thou turne and yeeld them their delight, but that thou fearst least I should steale a sight. [XIIII. I Loue alas, alas, yet am not loued] I loue alas, alas, yet am not loued I loue alas, alas, yet am not loued, alas, alas, yet am not loued, For cruell she, to pitty, is not moued: My constant loue with scorne she ill rewardeth, onely my sighs a little she regardeth, onely my sighs a little little shee regardeth, Yet more and more the quenchlesse fire increaseth, yet more and more the quenchlesse fire increaseth, which to my greater torment neuer ceaseth. neuer ceaseth. yet more and more, the quenchlesse fire increaseth, which to my greater torment neuer ceaseth. [XV. As matchlesse beauty thee a PhÅnix proues] As matchlesse beauty thee a PhÅnix proues As matchlesse beauty thee a PhÅnix proues, faire Leonilla, faire Leonilla, faire Leonilla, As matchlesse beauty thee a PhÅnix proues, faire Leonilla, So thy sowre-sweet loues: For when young Acons eye thy proud hart tames, for when young Acons eye, for when young Acons eye thy proud. hart tames, Thou dy'st in him, and liuest in my flames. thou dyest in him, and liuest in my flames.

Deeming his life a Scene, the world a Stage whereon man acts his weary Pilgrimage. whereon man acts, whereon man acts his weary Pilgrimage. Here endenth the Songs of 4. parts. Of 5. voc. [XVII. Sweet hony sucking Bees] Sweet hony sucking Bees, why doe you still Sweet hony sucking Bees, why doe you still, surfet on Roses, Pincks and Violets? As if the choysest Nectar lay in them, wherwith you store, your curious Cabinets: Ah, make your flight, Ah, make your flight, to Melisuauiaes lips, there, there may you reuell in Ambrosian cheere, Where smiling Roses and sweet Lillies sits, there may you reuell, keeping their Spring-tide, keeping their Spring-tide graces, keeping their Spring-tide graces all the yeare. keeping their Spring-tide graces all the yeare, [XVIII. Yet Sweet take heed] Yet Sweet take heed, all sweets are hart to get Yet Sweet take heed, all sweets are hart to get, sting not, sting not her soft lippes, Oh beware of that, Oh, oh beware of that, For if one flaming dart come from her eye, Come from her eye, was neuer dart so sharp, Ah then you dye, you dye, For if one flaming dart come from her eye, was neuer dart so sharp, Ah then you dye, then you dye, Ah then you dye, was neuer dart so sharp, Ah then you dye, Ah then you dye. Ah then you dye. [XIX. All pleasure is of this condition] All pleasure is of this condition All pleasure is of this condition, It pricks men forward to fruition, All It pricks men forward to fruition, But if enioy'd then like the humming Bee, then like the humming Bee, The honie being shed away doth flee, away doth flee, But leaues a sting that wounds the inward hart, But leaues a sting that wounds the inward hart, the inward hart, With gnawing griefe, and neuer ending smart. With gnawing griefe, and neuer ending smart. With gnawing griefe, and neuer ending smart. [XX. Oft haue I vow'd how dearely I did loue thee] Oft haue I vow'd how dearely I did loue thee Oft haue I vow'd how dearely I did loue thee, how deerely I did loue thee, And oft obseru'd thee with all willing dutie, Sighs I haue sent stil hoping to remoue thee, stil hoping to remoue thee: Millions of tears, of tears, I tendred to thy beautie, millions of teares, I tendred to thy beautie, Yet thou of sighs and silly teares regardlesse, yet thou of sighs and silly teares regardlesse, suffrest my feeble hart to pine with anguish, Whilst all my barren hopes returne rewardlesse, My bitter dayes doe wast, and I doe languish. My bitter dayes doe wast, and I doe languish, and I doe languish. [XXI. Downe in a valley] Downe in a valley, as Alexis trips Downe in a valley, as Alexis trips, Daphne sat sweetly sleeping, sat sleeping, Soone as the wanton toucht her ruddy lips, she nicely fell a weeping, The wag full softly lifts her, And too and fro hee sifts her, But when nor sighes nor kisses mou'd her pitty, nor sighes could moue her pitty, nor teares could moue her pitty, With plaints he warbles forth, he warbles forth this mournfull ditty. But when nor sighes (ah) nor kisses mou'd her pitty, nor sighs could moue her pitty, nor teares could moue her pitty, with plaints he warbles forth, he warbles forth, this mournful ditty. [XXII. Hard Destinies are Loue and Beautie parted] Hard Destinies are Loue and Beautie parted? Hard Destinies are Loue and Beautie parted? Fayre Daphne so disdainfull? Cupid thy shafts are too vniustly darted, Fond Loue thy wounds be painefull, But sith my louely Iewell is prou'd so coy and cruell, Ile liue and frolicke in her beauties treasure, Ile liue and frolicke in her beauties treasure, But languish, faint, and dye, But languish, faint and dye in her displeasure.
