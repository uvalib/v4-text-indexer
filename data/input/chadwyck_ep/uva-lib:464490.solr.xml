      <field name="fulltext">SIR AMADACE Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. I Thenne the kny?t and þe stuard fre, Þay casten þere houe hit best my?te be Bothe þe ferre and nere. Þe stuard sayd, “Sir, ?e awe wele more Þenne ?e may of ?our londus rere In faythe this seuyn ?ere. Quoso may best, furste ?e mun pray, Abyde ?o till anothir day. And parte ?our cowrte in sere; And putte away full mony of ?our men; And hald butte one, quere ?e hald ten, Tha?ghe þay be neuyr so dere.” II Þenne Sir Amadace sayd, “I my?te lung spare Or all þese godus qwitte ware, And haue no?te to spend; Sithun duell here, quere I was borne, Bothe in hething and in scorne— And I am so wele kennit. And men full fast wold ware me, Þat of þayre godus hade bynne so fre, Þat I haue hade in honde. Or I schuld hold men in awe or threte, Þat þay my?te no?te hor awne gud gete— Thenne made I a full fowle ende. III “Butte anothir rede I wulle me toe, Wurche anothir way þen soe, Bettur sayd soro þenne sene. Butte, gode stuard, as þu art me lefe, Lette neuyr mon wete my grete mischefe, Butte hele hit vs betwene. For seuyn ?ere wedsette my lond To þe godus þat I am awand Be quytte holly bidene. For oute of þe cuntray I wille weynde, Quil I haue gold, siluyr to spende, And be owte of dette full clene. IV “?ette wille I furst, or I fare, Be wele more riall þen I was are, Therfore ordan þu schall, For I wulle gif full ryche giftus Bothe to squiers and to kny?tis; To pore men dele a dole. Suche men my?te wete þat I were wo, Þat full fayn wold hit were such toe, Þat my?te notte bete my bale. So curtase a mon was neuyr non borne That schuld scape withoute a scorne Be iche mon had told his tale.” V Thanne Sir Amadase, as I ?o say, Hase ordanut him opon [a] day Of þe cuntray in a stowunde. ?ette he gafe ful riche giftus, Bothe to squiers and to kny?tis, Stedus, haukes, and howundes. Sethun afturward, as I ?o say, Hase ordanut him opon [a] day, And furthe þenne conne he founde. Be þat he toke his leue to wynde. He lafte no more in his cofurs to spende, But euyn xl. powunde. VI Þenne Sir Amadace, as I ?o say, Rode furthe opon his way, Als fast as euyr he my?te. Throowte a forest, by one cite, Þer stode a chapell of stone and tre, And þerinne se he a li?te. Commawundut his knaue for to fare, To wete quat li?te þat were thare— “And tithing bring me ry?te.” The knaue did as his maister him bade, Butte suche a stinke in þe chapell he hade, Þat dwelle þer he ne my?te. VII He stopput his nase with his hude; Nerre þe chapell he ?ode, Anturs for to lere. And as he loket in atte þe glasse, To wete quat meruail þat þer wasse, So see he stonde a bere. Candils þer were brennyng toe, A woman sittyng, and no moe. Lord! carefull wasse hur chere. Tithinges þere conne he non frayn, Butte to his lord he wente agayn, Told him quat he see thare. VIII And sayd, “Sir, atte ?ondur chapell haue I bene, A selcothe si?te þer haue I sene, My herte is heuy as lede. Þer stondus a bere and canduls toe; Þer sittus a woman, and no moe. Lord! carefull is hur rede. Suche a stinke as I had þare, Sertis þenne had I neuyr are Noquere in so stid. For this palfray that I on ryde, Þer my?te I no lengur abide; I traue I haue ke?te me dede. IX Þenne Sir Amace commawundut his squir to fare, To witte quat woman þat there ware, “And tithinges bring þu me.” As he loket in atte þe walle, As þe knaue sayd, he fund withalle, Him tho?te hit grete pete. Butte in his nace smote such a smell, That þere my?te he no lengur duelle, But sone agayn gose he. He sayd, “Gud Lord, nowe with ?our leue, I pray ?o take hit no?te on greue, For ?e may notte wete for me.” X He sayd, “Sir, þer stondus a bere, and candils toe, A woman sittyng, and no moe. Lord! carefull is hur chere. Sore ho sikes and hondus wringus, And euyr ho crius on heuyn kynges, How lung ho schall be thare. Ho says, Dere God, quat may þat be, The grete soro þat ho opon him se, Stingcand opon his bere. Ho says, ho will notte leue him allone Till ho fall dede downe to þe stone, For his life was hur full dere.” XI Þenne Sir Amadace smote his palfray with is spur, And rode vnto þe chapell dur; And hastele doune he li?te. As his menne sayd, so con him thinke That he neuyr are hade such a stynke, And inne thenne wente þat kny?te. He sayd, “Dame, God rest with þe.” Ho sayd, “Sir, welcum most ?e be.” A[nd] salit him anon ry?te. He sayd, “Dame, quy sittus þu here Kepand this dede cors opon þis bere, Thus onyli vpon a ny?te?” XII Ho sayd, “Sir, nedelonges most I sitte him by, Hifath, þer will him non butte I, For he wasse my wedutte fere.” Þenne Sir Amadace sayd, “Me likes full ill, ?e ar bothe in plyit to spille, He lise so lung on bere. Quat a mon in his lyue wasse he?” “Sir, a marchand of this cite, Hade riche rentus to rere. And euiryche ?ere thre hundrythe powndee Of redy monay and of rowunde, And for dette ?ette lise he here.” XIII Thenne Sir Amadace sayd, “For þe rode, On quat maner spendutte he his gud Þat þusgate is away?” “Sir, on gentilmen and officers, On grete lordus, þat was his perus, Wold giffe hom giftus gay. Riche festus wold he make, And pore men, for Goddus sake, He fed hom euyriche day. Quil he hade any gud to take, He wernut no mon, for Goddus sake, Þat wolnotte onus say nay. XIV “?ette he didde as a fole. He cladde mo men agaynus a ?ole Thenne did a nobull kny?te: For his mete he wold not spare; Burdes in þe halle were neuyr bare, With clothes richeli di?te. Giffe I sayd he did no?te wele, He sayd, God send hit eueryche dele, And sette my wurdus atte li?te. Bi thenne he toke so mycul opon his name, Þat I dar notte telle ?o, lord, for schame Þe godus now þat he a?te. XV “And þenne come dethe, wo hym be, And partutt my lord and me, Lafte me in all þe care. Quen my ne?teburs herd tell þat seke he lay, Þay come to me, as þay best may, Þair gud aschet þai þare. All þat euyr was his and myne, Hors and naute, shepe and squwyne, Away þay drafe and bare. My dowary to my lyue I sold, And all þe peneys to hom told. Lord! ?ette a?te he wele mare. XVI “Quen I hade quytte all þat I my?te gete, ?ette a?te he thritte powunde bi grete, Holly till a stydde; Till a marchand of this cite, Was fer oute in anothir cuntre, Come home quen he was dede. And quenne he herd telle of my febull fare, He come to me as breme as bare, This corse þe erthe forbede, And sayd, howundus schuld his bodi to draw, Þen on þe fild his bonus tognaue. Þus carefull is my rede. XVII “And this xvi. weke I haue setyn here, Kepand þis dede cors opon this bere, With candils brennand bry?te. And so schall I euyrmore do, Till dethe cum and take me to, Bi Mary, most of my?te!” Þenne Sir Amadace franut hur þe marchandes name That hade done hur all þat schame. Ho told him anon ry?te. He sayd, “God þat is bote of all bale, Dame, cumford þe, and so he schale; And, dame, haue þu gud ny?te.” XVIII Thenne Sir Amadace on his palfray lepe; A ffitte Vnnethe me my?te forgoe to wepe, For his dedus him sore fortho?te; Sayd, “?ondur mon þat lise ?ondur chapell withinne, He my?te full wele be of my kynne, For ry?te so haue I wro?te.” Þenne he told his sometour quat þe marchand he?t, And sayd, “I will sowpe with him tony?te, Be God þat me dere bo?te! Go, loke þu di?te oure soper syne, Gode ryall metis and fyne, And spicis þenne spare þu no?te.” XIX And sone quen þe sometour herd, To þe marchandus howse he ferd, And ordanut for that kny?te. Þenne Sir Amadace come riding thoe, But in his hert was him full woe, And hasteli dowun he li?te. Sithun intylle a chambur þe kny?te ?ede, And kest opon him othir wede, With torches brennyng bry?te. He cummawundutte his squier for to goe, To pray þe marchand and his wife allsoe To soupe with him þat ny?te. XX Þenne þe squier weyndut vpon his way, And to þe marchand conne he say; His ernde told he thenne. He squere, “Be Jhesu, Mare sone, Þat lordus will hit schall be done, Of cumford was þat man. Þenne þayre soper was nere di?te; Burdes were houyn hee on li?te; [the] marchand [the] dees began. Sir Amadace sate, and made gud chere, Butte on þe dede cors þat lay on bere fful mycull his tho?te was on. XXI Sir Amadace sayd, “Tony?te as I come bi the strete, I see a si?te I thenke on ?ete, That sittus me nowe full sore. In a chapell beside a way A dede cors opon a bere lay, A woman all mysfare.” “?e,” þe marchand sayd, “God gif him a sore grace, And all suche waisters as he wasse, For he sittus me nowe sare; For he lise þere with my thritti powunde Of redy monay and of rowunde, Of hitte gete I neuyr more.” XXII Thenne Sir Amadace sayd, “Take þe till a bettur rede, Thenke þat Gode forgaue his dede, Grete merit þu may haue. Thenke how God ordant for the Bettur grace þen euyr had he. Lette þe cors go inne his graue.” Þenne he squere, “Be Jhesu, Mare sun, Þat body schall neuyr in the erthe come My siluyr tille þat I haue; Till ho be ded as wele as he, Þat howundus schall, þat I may se, On filde þayre bonus tognaue.” XXIII Quen Sir Amadace herd þat he hade squorne, He cald his stuard him beforne, Of kyndenesse þat kny?te con kithe, And bede, “Go foche me thritti powunde Of redy monay and of rowunde, Hastely and belyue.” Þe stuard tho?te hit was agaynus skille, Butte he most nede do his maistur wille— Now listun and ?e may lithe. Þer Sir Amadace payd him thritti powund of monay fyne. And thenne Sir Amadace asket to wyne, And prayd þe marchand be blythe. XXIV Þen Sir Amadace asket, “Awe he þe any mare?” “Nay, Sir,” he sayd, “wele most ?e fare. For thus muche he me a?te.” Þenne Sir Amadace sayd, “As furthe as x. pounde will take I schall lette do for his sake, Querthro?e he haue his ri?te. I schall for him gere rede and singe, Bringe his bodi to Cristun berunge, That schall þu see wythe si?te. Go pray all þe religius of this cite Tomorne þat þay wold dyne with me, And loke þayre mete be dy?te.” XXV Howe erly quen day con spring, Þen holli all þe bellus con ring That in þe cite was. Religius men eurichon Toward this dede cors are þay gone With mony a riche burias. Thritty prustus þat day con sing, And thenne Sir Amadace offurt a ring Atte euyriche mas. Quen þe seruise was all done, He prayd hom to ete with him atte none, Holli more and lasse. XXVI Þenne þe marchand wente tille one pillere; Mony a mon dro?he him nere To wete quat he wold say. He sayd, “Sirs, there hase byn here A ded cors opon a bere— ?e wotte querfore hit lay. And hase comun a full riall kny?te, Of all þe godes þe cors me he?te Hase made me redi pay. Vnto his cofurs he hase sente, And geuyn x. powunde to his termente, Wythe riche ringus today. XXVII “Hit is on his nome þat I say, He prays ?o holly to mete today, All þat þer bene here.” Þay did as þe marchand bade; Mete and drinke ynu?he þay hade, With licius drinke and clere. And Sir Amadace wold no?te sitte downe, Butte to serue þe pore folke he was full bowne, For þay lay his hert nere. And quen þay hade etun withinne þat halle, Þenne Sir Amadace toke leue atte all, Vnsemand with full glad chere. XXVIII Quen Sir Amadace hade etun, To sadull his horse was no?te for?etun, Þay bro?te hym his palfray. Thenne his sometour mon before was dy?te, Þer as that lord schuld leng all ny?te And hade nothing to pay. Quat wundur were hit tha?he him were wo Quen all his godus were spendutte him fro, Þe sothe gif I schuld say? Þenne Sir Amadace kidde he was gentilman bornne, He come þe grattust maystur beforne, Tok leue, and wente his way. XXIX Qwen he was gone on this kin wise, Thenne iche mon sayd þayre deuise, Quen he was passutte þe ?ate. Sum sayd, “Þis gud full li?teli he wan, Þat thusgate spendutte hit on this man, So li?tely lete hit scape.” Sum sayd, “In gud tyme were he borne Þat hade a peny him biforne,” That knew full litull his state. Lo, how þay demun þe gentill kny?te, Quen he hade spendut all þat he my?te. Butte þe trauthe full litull þay wote. Quen he come sex mile þe cite fro, A crosse partut þe way atoe. Thenne speke Sir Amadace: To his stuard he sayd full rathe, His sometour and his palfray mon bothe, And all þer euyr was, Sayd, “Gode sirs, take no?te on greue, For ?e most noue take ?our leue, For ?oureseluun knauyn þe cace; For I may lede no mon in londe, Butte I hade gold and siluyr to spend, Neuyr no quere in no place.” XXX Now the hardust hertut men þat there ware, For to wepe þai my?t notte spare Quen þay herd him say so. He sayd, “Gode sirs, haue ?e no care, For ?e mone haue maysturs euyrqware, As wele wurthi ?e ar soe. ?ette God may me sende of his sele, Þat I may keuyr of this full wele, And cum owte of this wo. A mery mon ?ette may ?e se me, And be full dere welcum to me, Bothe ?e and mony moe.” [Sir Amadas seyd in þat stonde: “Þo warst hors is worþe ten pownde Of hom all þat here gon. Sqwyar, yomon, and knave, Ylke mon his owne schall have Þat he syttes apon. Sadyll, brydyll, and oder geyre, Fowre so gud þoffe hit were, J woch hit save bi Sen Jon. God mey make yo full gud men. þryst of hevon Y yo beken!” Þei weped and partyd ylke on.] XXXI Quen all his men was partutte him fro, Þe kny?te lafte still in all þe woe, Bi himseluun allone. Thro?he þe forest his way lay ri?te; Of his palfray doune he li?te, Mournand and made grete mone. Quen he tho?te on his londus brode, His castels hee, his townus made, Þat were away euyrichon, That he had sette, and layd to wedde, And was owte of the cuntray for pourte fledde. Thenne þe kny?te wexe will of wone. XXXII Thenne bespeke Sir Amadace, “A mon that litul gode hase, Men sittus ry?te no?te him bye; For I hade thre hundrythe powunde of rente, I spendut two in þat entente. Of such forloke was I. Euyr quyll I suche housold hold, For a grete lord was I tellut, Much holdun vppe thareby. Nowe may wise men sitte atte home, Quen folus may walke full wille of wone, And, Christ wotte, so may hi.” XXXIII He sayd, “Jhesu, as þu deet on þe rode, And for me sched þi precius blode, And all þis word þu wanne; Þu lette me neuyr come in þat sy?te, Þer I haue bene knauen for a kny?te, Butte if I may avoue his thanne. And gif me grace to somun all þo That wilsumly are wente me fro, And all þat me gode ons hase done; Or ellus, Lord, I aske þe rede, Hastely þat I were dede, Lord, wele were me thanne. XXXIV “For all for wonting of my witte, Fowle of the lond am I putte, Of my frindes I haue made foes; For kyndenes of my gud wille, I am in poynte myselfe to spille;” Thus flote Syr Amadace. He sayd, “Jhesu, as þu deut on tre, Summe of þi sokur send þu me, Spedely in this place! For summe of thi sokur and þu me send, And ?ette I schuld ful gladely spende On all þat mestur hase.” XXXV Now thro þe forest as he ferd, He wende þat no mon hade him herd, For he se?he no mon in si?te. So come a mon ryding him bye, And speke on him fulle hastely, Þerof he was afry?te. And so was all his othir wede— Hade consciens of a kny?te. Now tho?he Sir Amadace wasse in mournyng bro?te, His curtase for?ete he no?te, He saylut him anon ry?te. XXXVI Quod þe quite kny?te, “Quat mon is this, That all þis mowrnyng makes thus With so simpull chere?” Þenne Sir Amadace sayd, “Nay!” Þe quite kny?te bede “do way, For þat quile haue I bene here. Thowe schild no?te mowrne no suche wise, For God may bothe mon falle and rise, For his helpe is euyrmore nere. For gud his butte a lante lone, Sumtyme men [haue] hit, sumtyme none, Þu hast full mony a pere. XXXVII “Now thenke on him, þat deut on rode. Þat for vs sched his precius blode, For þe and monkynd all. For a mon that geuees him to god thewis, Authir to gentilmen or to schrewis, On summe side will hit fall. A mon that hase all way bynne kynde, Sum curtas mon ?ette may he fynde, That mekille may stonde in stalle; Repente þe no?te þat þu hase done, For he þat schope bothe sunne and mone, Full wele may pay for alle.” Milke quyte was his stede, XXXVIII Quod þe quite kny?te, “Wold þu luffe him aure all thing That wold þe owte of thi mournyng bringe, And keuyr þe owte of kare? For here beside duellus a riall king, And hase a do?tur fayre and ?inge, He luffis nothing mare. And þu art one of þe semelist kny?te Þat euyr ?ette I see with sy?te, That any armes bare. Þat mun no mon hur wedde ne weld, Butte he þat first is inne þe fild, And best thenne justus thare. XXXIX “And þu schalt cum thedur als gay Als any erliche mon may, Of þi sute schall be non; Þu schall haue for þi giftus geuand, Grete lordus to þi honde, And like þu spare ri?te none.

Loke þat þu be large of feyce, Tille þu haue wonon gode congrece, And I schall þay ichone.” XL He sayd, “Þat þu be fre of wage, And I schall pay for þi costage, x. thowsand gif þu ladde. Þer schall þu wynne full mekille honowre, ffild and frithe, towne and towre, Þat lady schall þu wedde.

Butte a forwart make I with the or þat þu goe, That euyn to part betwene vs toe Þe godus þu has wonun and spedde.” XLI Þenne bespeke Sir Amadace, “And þu haue my?te thru?e Goddus grace So to cumford to me, Þu schalt fynde me true and lele And euyn, lord, for to dele Bettwix þe and me.” “Fare wele,” he sayd, “Sir Amadace! And þu schall wurche thru?e Goddus grace, And hit schall be with the.” Sir Amadace sayd, “Haue gode day, And þu schall fynde me, and I may, Als true as any mon may be.” a ffitte XLII Now als Sir Amadace welke bi þe se sonde, Þe broken schippus he þer fonde— Hit were meruayl to say. He fond wrekun amung þe stones Kny?tes in meneuere for þe nones, Stedes quite and gray, With all kynne maner of richas Þat any mon my?te deuise Castun vppe with waturs lay; Kistes and cofurs bothe þer stode, Was fulle of gold precius and gode, No mon bare no?te away. XLIII Þenne Sir Amadace he him cladde, And þat was in a gold webbe, A bettur my?te none be. And þe stede þat he on rode, Wasse þe best þat euyr mon hade In iusting for to see. Þer he wanne full mecul honoure, Fild and frithe, toune and towre, Castell and riche cite. Aure þat gud he houet full ry?te. That see the king and his do?tur bry?te, Þe iusting furthe schild be. XLIV Þe kinge sayd to his do?tur bry?te, “Lo, ?ond houes a riall kny?te!” A messyngere he ches, His aune squier, and kny?tes thre, And bede, “Go loke quat ?one may be, And telle me quo hit is. And his gud hitte schall be tente Holly to his cummawundemente, Certan withowtun lesse. Go we to his comyng all togethir, And say þat he is welcum hethir, And he be comun o pese.” XLV As þe messingerus welke bi þe see sonde, Þay toke Sir Amadace bi þe quite honde, And tithinges conne him fraynne: And sayd, “Oure lord, þe king, hase send vs hethir To wete ?oure comyng all togethir, And ?e wold vs sayn. He says ?our gud hitte schall be tente, Holly atte ?oure commawundemente, Sertan is no?te to layne. Quatseuer ?e wille with þe kinges men do, ?o thar butte commawunde hom þerto, And haue seruandis full bayne.” XLVI And Sir Amadace sayd, “I wasse a prince of mekil pride, And here I hade tho?te to ryde, Forsothe atte this iournay. I was vetaylet with wyne and flowre, Hors, stedus, and armoure, Kny?tus of gode aray. Stithe stormes me oredrofe, Mi nobull schippe hit all torofe, Þo sothe ?oureseluun may say. To spend I haue enu?he plente, Butte all þe men þat come with me, Forsothe þai bynne away.” XLVII Þen Sir Amadace, þat wasse so stithe on stede, To þe castell ?ates þay conne him lede, And told þe king all þe cace. Þe king sayd, “Þu art welcum here, I rede þe be full gud chere, Thonke Jhesu of his grace. Seche a storme as þu was inne, Þat þu my?te any socur wynne, A full fayre happe hit wase. I see neuyr man þat sete in sete, So muche of my lufue my?te gete As þu þiseluun hase.” XLVIII Thenne þe king for Sir Amadace sake A riall cri thenne gerutte he make Throoute in þat cite. To all þat þer wold seruyse haue, Kny?te, squiere, ?omon and knaue, Iche mon in þayre degree, Þat wold duelle with Sir Amadace, Hade lost his men in a cace, And drownet hom on þe se. He wold gif hom toe so muche, or ellus more, As any lord wold euyr or qware, And þay wold with him be. XLIX Quen gentilmen herd þat cry, Þay come to him full hastely, With him for to be. Be þen þe iusting wasse alle cryed, There was no lord þer besyde Had halfe as mony men os he. Þer he wanne so mycull honoure, Fild and frithe, towne and toure, Castell and riche cite; A hundrithe sedis he wan and moe, And gaue þe king þe ton halue of thoe, Butte þer othir til his felo keput he. L Quen þe iusting was all done, To vnarme hom pay wente anone, Hastely and belyue, Þen sayd þe king anon ry?te, And bede, “Gromersy, gentull kny?te!” Ofte and fele sithe. Þen þe kingus do?tur þat wasse gente, Vnlasutte þe kny?te, to mete þay wente, All were þay gladde and blithe. Quen aythir of othir hade a si?te, Suche a lufue betuene hom li?te, Þat partut neuyr þayre lyue. LI Quen þay hade etun, I vnderstonde, Þe king toke Sir Amadace bi þe quite honde, And to him conne he say: “Sir,” he sayd, “withoutun lesse, I haue a do?tur þat my nayre ho isse. And ho be to ?aure pay, And ?e be a mon þat will wedde a wife, I vouche hur safe, by my life, On ?o þat fayre may. Here a gifte schall I ?o gife, Halfe my kyndome quiles I life, Take all aftur my daye.” [“Gramarcy,” seyd Sir Amadas, And þonkyd þo kyng of þat grace, Of his gyfftes gudde. Sone after, as Y yow sey, To the kyrke yode þei To wedde þat frely fode. Þer was gold gyffon in þat stonde, And plenty of syluer, many a ponde, Be þe way as þei yode. And after in hall þei satte all, Þo lordes and þo lades small Þat comon wer of gentyll kyn.] LII Þus is Sir Amadace keuyrt of his wo, Þat God leue grace, þat we were so! A riall fest gerut he make. Þer weddut he þat lady bri?te, Þe maungery last a faurteny?te, With schaftes for to schake. Othir halfe ?ere þay lifd in gomun, A fayre knaue child hade þay somun, Grete myrthes con þay make. Listuns now, lordinges, of anters grete, Quyll on a day before þe mete Þis felau come to þe ?ate. LIII He come in als gay gere, Ry?te as he an angell were, Cladde he was in quite. Vnto þe porter speke he thoe, Sayd, “To þi lord myn ernde þu go, Hasteli and alstite. And if he frayne o?te aftur me, For quethun I come, or quat cuntre, Say him my sute is quite. And say we haue togethir bene, I hope full wele he haue me sene, He wille hitte neuyr denyte.” LIV Þenne þe porter wente into þe halle, Alsone his lord he metes withalle, He sailles him as he conne: Sayd, “Lord, here is comun þe fayrist kny?te That euyr ?ette I see with sy?te, Sethen I was market mon. Milke quite is his stede, And so is all his oþer wede, That he has opon. He says ?e haue togethir bene, I hope full well ?e haue him sene, Butte with him is comun no mon.” LV “Is he comun,” he sayd, “my nowun true fere? To me is he bothe lefe and dere, So aght him wele to be. Butte, all my men, I ?o commawunde, To serue him wele to fote and honde, Ry?te as ?e wold do me.” Þen Sir Amadace a?aynus him wente, And allso did þat ladi gente, Þat was so bry?te of ble. And did wele þat hur aghte to do, All þat hur lord lufd wurschipput ho, All suche wemen wele my?te be. LVI Quo schuld his stede to stabulle haue? Kny?te, squier, ?omon, ne knaue, Nauthir with him be bro?te. Thenne Sir Amadace wold haue takyun his stede, And to þe halle himseluun lede, Butte, so wold he no?te. He sayd, “Sertan, þe sothe to telle, I will nauthir ete, drinke, no duelle, Be God, þat me dere bo?te. Butte take and dele hit euun in toe, Gif me my parte, and lette me goe, Gif I be wurthi o?te.” LVII Thenne spoke Sir Amadace so fre, “For Goddus luffe, lette suche wurdus be! Þay greuun my herte full sore. For we my?te no?te þis faurteny?te Owre rich londus dele and di?te, Þay liun so wide quare. Butte lette vs leng togethir here, Ri?te as we brethir were, As all þi none hit ware. And othir gates no?te part will wee, Butte atte þi will, sir, þu hit spare!” LVIII He sayd, “Broke wele þi londus brode, Þi castels hee, þi townus made, Of hom kepe I ri?te none; Allso þi wuddus, þi waturs clere, Þi frithis, þi forestus, fer and nere, Þi ringus with riche stone, Allso þi siluyr, þi gold rede, For hit may stonde me in no stidde, I squere, bi Sayn John! But, be my faythe, withoutun stryue, Half þi child, and halfe þi wyue, And þay schall with me gone.” LIX “Alas!” sayd Sir Amadace þan, “Þat euyr I this woman wan, Or any wordes gode. For his life, þat deet on tre, Quatseuer ?e will, do with me, For him þat deet on rode. ?e, take all þat euyr I haue Wythe thi, þat ?e hur life saue.” Þenne þe kny?te wele vndurstode, And squere, “Be God, þat me dere bo?te, Othir of þi thinge þen kepe I no?te, Off all þi wordes gode! LX Butte thenke on þi couenand þat þu made In þe wode, quen þu mestur hade, How fayre þu hettus me þare!” Sir Amadace sayd, “I wotte, hit was soe, But my lady for to sloe, Me thinke grete synne hit ware.” Then þe lady vndurstode anon, Þe wurd þat was betwene hom, And greuyt hur neuyr þe more. Þen ladi sayd, “For his luffe þet deut on tre, Loke ?oure couandus holdun be, Goddes forbotte ?e me spare!” LXI Þenne bespeke þat ladi bri?te, Sayd, “Ye schall him hold þat ?e haue hi?te, Be God, and Sayn Dri?tine! For his lufe þat deet on tre, Loke ?aure couandus holdun be, ?ore forward was full fyne. Sithun Crist will þat hit be so, Take and parte me euun in toe, Þu wan me and I am thine. Goddus forbotte þat ?e hade wyuut, Þat I schuld ?o a lure makette, ?ore wurschip in londe to tyne!” LXII Still ho stode, withoutun lette, Nawthir changet chere, ne grette, Þat lady myld and dere. Bede, “Foche me my ?ung sun me beforne, For he was of my bodi borne, And lay my herte full nere.” “Now,” quod þe quite kny?te þare, “Quethur of hom luffus þu mare?” He sayd, “My wife, so dere!” “Sithun þu luffus hur þe more Þu schalt parte hur euyn before, Hur quite sidus in sere.” LXIII Þenne quen Sir Amadace see Þat no bettur hitte my?te bee, He ferd as ho were wode. Þenne all þe mene in þat halle, Doune on squonyng þer con þay falle, Before þayre lord þat stode. Þe burd was bro?te þat schuld hur on dele; Ho kissute hur lord sithis fele, And sithun þerto ho ?ode. Ho layd hur downe mekely enu?he, A cloth þen aure hur enyn þay dro?he; Þat lady was myld of mode. LXIV Þenne þe quite kny?te, “I will do þe no vnskill, Þu schalt dele hit atte þi wille, Þe godus þat here now is.” Þenne speke Sir Amadace so fre, Sayd, “Atte ?our wille, lord, all schall be, And so I hope hit is.” Þen Sir Amadace a squrd vppehente, To strike þe ladi was his entente, And thenne þe quite kny?te be[de] “sese!” He toke vppe þe ladi, and þe litull knaue, And to Sir Amadace þer he hom gaue, And sayd, “Now is tyme of pees!” LXV He sayd, “I con notte wite þe gif þu were toe, Suche a ladi for to slo, Þi wurschip þus wold saue. ?ette I was largely as gladde, Quen þu gafe all þat euyr þu hade, My bones for to graue. In a chapell quere I lay to howundus mete, Þu payut furst thritty powund be grete, Sethun all þat þu my?tus haue. Þer I beso?te God schuld keuyr þe of þi care, Þat for me hade made þe so bare, Mi wurschip in lond to saue.” LXVI “Fare wele now,” he sayd, “mynne awne true fere! For my lenging is no lengur her, With tunge sum I þe telle. Butte loke þu lufe þis lady as þi lyue, Þat þus mekely, withouten stryue, Þi forwardus wold fulfille.” Þenne he wente oute of þat towne, He glode away as dew in towne, And þay abode þer stille. Þay knelutte downe opon þayre kne, And thonket God and Mary fre, And so þay hade gud skille. LXVII Þenne Sir Amadace and his wiue, With joy and blis þay ladde þayre liue, Vnto þayre ending daye. Þer is ladis now in lond full foe Þat wold haue seruut hor lord soe, Butte sum wold haue sayd nay. Botte quoso serues God truly, And his modur, Mary fre, Þis dar I sauely say: Gif hom sumtyme like full ille, ?ette God will graunte hom all hor wille, Tille heuyn þe redy waye. LXVIII Then Sir Amadace send his messingerus, All þe londus ferre and nere, Vnto his awne cuntre. Till all þat euyr his lond withheld, ffrithe or forest, towne of filde, With tresur owte bo?te he. His stuard and othir, þat with him were, He send aftur hom, as ?e may here, And gafe hom gold and fee. And þay þer with him for to leng, Euyrmore till þayre lyuus ende, With myrthe and solempnite. LXIX Þenne sone aftur þe kinge deet, atte Goddus wille, And þay abode þare stille. As ?e schall vndurstond. Þenne was he lord of toure and towne, And all þay comun to his somoune, All þe grete lordus of the londe. Þenne Sir Amadace, as I ?o say, Was crownette kinge opon a day, Wyth gold so clure schinand. Jhesu Criste in Trinite, Blesse and glade þis cumpany, And ore vs halde his hande! ffinis de Sir Amadace THE AVOWING OF ARTHUR I He þat made vs on þe mulde, And fair fourmet þe folde, Atte his will as he wold; The see and the sande; Giffe hom joy þat will here Of du?ti men, and of dere, Of haldurs, þat before vs were, Þat lifd in this londe. One was Arther the kinge. Withowtun any letting, With him was mony lordinge Hardi of honde; Wite and war ofte þay were, Bold vndur banere, And wi?te weppuns wold were, And stifly wold stond. II Þis is no fantum, ne no fabull; ?e wote wele of þe rowuntabull Of prest men and priueabull, Was holdun in prise. Cheuetan of chiualry, Kyndenesse of curtesy, Hunting full warly, As wayt men and wise, To þe forest þa[y] fare, To hunte atte buk and atte bare, To þe herte, and to þe hare, Þat bredus in þe rise. Þe king atte Carlele he lay, Þe hunter cummys on a day, Sayd, “Sir, þer walkes in my way, A well grim gryse! III He is a balefull bare, Secheon segh I neuyr are. He hase wro?te me mycull care, And hurte of my howundes; Slayn hom downe slely, With fe?ting full furcely. Wasse þer none so hardi Durste bide in his bandus. On him spild I my spere, And mycull of my nothir gere; Þer mone no dintus him dere, Ne wurche him no wowundes. He is masly made, All of fellus þat he bade, Þer is no bulle so brade, That in frithe foundes. IV He is he?er þenne a horse, That vncumly corse; In fayth, him faylis no force Quen þat he schalle fe?te. And þerto, blake as a bere, Feye folke will be fere. Þer may no dyntus him dere, Ne him to dethe di?te. Quen he quettus his tusshes, Thenne he betus on þe busshes; All he riues and he russhes, Þat þe rote is vnry?te. He hase a laythelyche luffe Quen he castus vppe his stuffe; Quo durst abide him a buffe, Iwisse he were wi?te.” V He sais, “In Ingulwode is hee.” Þe toþer biddus, “Lette him bee; We schall that satnace see, Giffe þat he be þare.” Þe king callut on kny?tis thre; Himseluun wold þe fuyrthe be. He sayd, “Þere schalle no mo mene Wynde to þe bore.” Bothe Kay and Sir Gauan, And Bowdewynne of Bretan, Þe hunter and þe howundus squayn, Hase ?arket hom ?are; Þe kinge hase armut him in hie, And þo thre biurnes him bie, Now ar þay fawre all redie, And furthe conne þay fare. VI Vnto þe forest þay weynde, Þat was hardy and heynde; Þe hunter atte þe northe ende His bugull con he blaw; Vncoupult kenettis as he couthe; Witturly þay so?te þe southe, Raches with opon mouthe, Rennyng on a raw, Funde fute of þe bore, ffaste folutte to him thore Quen þat he herd, he hade care; To þe denne conne he draw. He slo?e hom downe slely, With fe?ting full fuyrsly; But witte ?e, sirs, witturly, He stode butte litull awe. VII Þay held him fast in his hold; He brittunt bercelettus bold, Bothe þe ?unge and þe old, And raste hom þe rest; Þe raches comun rengnyng him by, And bayet him full boldely, Butte þer was non so hardy Durste on þe fynde fast. Þenne þe hunter sayd, “Lo him þare! ?aw þar such him no mare; Now may ?e sone to him fare; Lette see quo dose beste. ?aw þar suche him neuyr more, Butte sette my hed opon a store, Butte giffe he flaey ?o all fawre, Þat griseliche geste!” VIII Þenne þe hunter turnes home agayn; Þe king callut on Sir Gauan, On Bawdewin of Bretan, And on kene Kay; He sayd, “Sirs, in ?our cumpany Myne avow make I, Were he neuyr so hardy, ?one satenas to say; To brittun him, and downe bringe, Withoute any helpinge— And I may haue my leuynge— Hentill tomorne atte day. And now, sirs, I cummaunde ?o To do as I haue done nowe, Ichone make ?our avowe.” Gladdely grawuntutte þay. IX Þen vnsquarut Gauan, And sayd godely agayn, “I avowe to Tarnewathelan, To wake hit all ny?te.” “And I avow,” sayd Kaye, “To ride þis forest or daye; Quoso wernes me þe waye, Hym to dethe di?te!” Quod Baudewyn, “To stynte owre strife, I avow, bi my life, Neuyr to be jelus of my wife, Ne of no birde bry?te; Nere werne nomon my mete, Quen I gode may gete, Ne drede my dethe for no threte, Nauthir of king ner kny?te.” X Butte now þay haue þayre vowes made, Þay buskutte hom, and furthe rade, To hold þat þay he?te hade, Ichone sere way. The king turnus to þe bore, Gauan, with[out] any more, To þe tarne con he fore, To wake hit today. Þenne Kay, as I conne roune, He rode þe forest vppe and downe. Boudewynne turnes to toune, Sum þat his gate lay; And sethun to bed bownus he. Butte carpe we now of þer othir thre, How þay preuyd hor wedde fee, Þo sothe for to say. XI Furst to carpe of oure kinge— Hit is a kyndeliche thinge— Atte his begynnyng Howe he dedde his dede. Till his houndus con he hold; The bore with his brode schilde, Folut hom fast in þe filde, And spillutte on hom gode spede. Þen þe kinge con crye, And carputte of venerie, To make his howundus hardi; Houut on a stede; Als sone as he come þare, A?aynus him rebowndet þe bare; He se neuyr no sy?te are So sore gerutte him to drede. XII He hade drede and doute, Of him þat was stirrun and stowte; He began to romy and rowte, And gapes and gones; Men my?te no?te his cowche kenne For howundes and for slayn men Þat he hade draun to his denne And brittunt alle to bonus. Þenne his tusshes con he quette, Opon þe kinge for to sette; He liftis vppe, withoutun lette, Stokkes and stonis. With wrathe he begynnus to wrote, He ruskes vppe mony a rote, With tusshes of iij. fote, So grisly he gronus! XIII Þenne þe kinge spanos his spere, Opon þat bore for to bere; Þer may no dyntus him dere, So sekir was his schilde. Þe grete schafte þat was longe, All to spildurs hit spronge; Þe gode stede þat was stronge, Was fallun in þe filde. As þe bore had mente, He gaue þe king suche a dinte, Or he my?te his bridull hente, Þat he my?te euyr hit fele. His stede was stonet, starkeded. He sturd neuyr owte of þat sted; To Jhesu abone he bede Fro wothes hym weylde. XIV Þenne þe king in his sadul sete, And wi?tely wan on his fete; He prays to Sayn Margarete, Fro wathes him ware. Did as a du?ty kny?te, Brayd oute a brand bry?te, And heue his schild opon hi?te, For spild was his spere. Sethun he buskette him ?are, Squithe withoutun any mare, A?aynus þe fynde for to fare, That hedoes was of hiere; So þay cowunturt in þe fild— For all þe weppuns þat he my?te weld, Þe bore brittunt his schild, On brest he conne bere. XV Þere downe knelus he, And prayus till him þat was so fre, “Send me þe vittore, Þis Satanas me sekes.” All wrote wex þat sqwyne, Blu, and brayd vppe his bryne, As kylne other kechine— Þus rudely he rekes. Þe kynge my?te him no?te see, Butte lenyt him doune bi a tree, So ny?e discumford was hee, For smelle oþer smekis. And as he neghet bi a noke, Þe king sturenly him stroke, That bothe his brees con blake, His maistry he mekes. XVI Thus his maistry mekes he, With dyntus that werun du?te; Were he heuyr so harde, Þus bidus þat brothe. Þe kinge with a nobull brande, He mette the bore comande; On his squrd till his hande, He rennes full rathe. He bare him inne atte þe throte; He made no myrthe of þat mote; He began to dotur and dote, Os he hade keghet scathe. With sit siles he adowne. To brittun him þe king was bowne, And sundurt in þat sesun His brode schildus bothe. XVII Þe king couthe of venery, Þolurt him full kyndely; Þe hed of þat hardy, He sette on a stake; Sethun brittuns he þe best, As venesun in forest; Bothe þe ?onge and lees He hongus on a noke. Þere downe knelys hee, Þat loues her þat is free, Sayd, “Þis socur þu hase send me, For þi sune sake.” If he were in a dale depe, He hade no kny?te him to kepe, For werre slidus he on slepe, No lengur my?te he wake. XVIII The king hase fillut his avowe— Of Kay carpe we nowe; How þat he come fro his prowe, ?e schall here more. Als he rode in þe ny?te, In þe forest he mette a kny?te Ledand a birde bry?te; Ho wepputte wundur sore. Ho sayd, “Sayn Mare my?te me spede, And saue me my madunhede, And giffe þe kny?te, for his dede, Bothe soro and care.” XIX Þus ho talkes him tille Quille ho hade sayd all hur wille; And Kay held him full stille, And in þe holte houes; He prekut oute prestely, And aurehiet him radly, And on þe kny?te conne cry, And pertely him reproues. And sayd, “Recraiand kny?te, Here I profur þe to fi?te; Bechesun of þat biurde bri?te, I bede þe my glouus!” Þe toþer vnsquarut him with skill, And sayd, “I am redy, at þi will, Þat forward to fulfille, In all þe me behouus. XX “Now quethun art þu?” quod Kay, “Or quethur is þu on way? Þi ri?te name þu me say! Quere wan þu þat wi?te?” Þe toþer vnsquarut him agayn, “Mi ri?te name is, no?te to layn, Sir Menealfe of the Mountayn, My godefadur hi?te. And this lady sum I þe telle, I fochet hur atte Ledelle, Þer hur frindus con hur selle As foes in a fi?te; So I talket hom tille, Þat muche blode conne I spille, And all a?aynus þayre awne wille; Þere wan I this wi?te.” XXI Quod Kay, “Þe batell I take Bechesun of þe birdus sake, And I schalle wurche þe wrake.” And sqwithely con squere. Þenne þay rode togedur ry?te, As frekes redy to fi?te— Bechesun of þat birde bry?te— Gay in hor gere. Menealfe was þe more my?ty, He stroke Kay stifly, Witte ?e, sirs, witturly, With a scharpe spere; All toschildurt his schilde, And aure his sadull gerut him to held, And felle him flatte in þe filde, And toke him vppe on werre. XXII Þus hase he wonun Kay on werre, And all tospild is his spere, And mekill of othir gere, Is holden to þe pees. Þenne unsquarut Kay a?ayn, And sayd, “Sir, atte Tarnewathelan Bidus me Sir Gauan, Is derwurthe on dese. Wold ?e thethur be bowne, Or ?e turnut to þe towne, He wold pay my rawunsone, Withowtyn delees.” He sayd, “Sir Kay, þi lyfe I þe he?te, For a cowrce of þat kny?te.” Þette Menealfe, or þe mydny?te, Him ruet all his rees. XXIII Þus þay turnut to þe torne With þe thriuand thorne; Kay callut on Gauan ?orne, Asshes, “Quo is there?” He sayd, “I, Kay, þat þu knawes, Þat owte of tyme bostus and blawus; Butte þu me lese with þi lawes, I lif neuyrmore. For as I rode in þe ny?te, In þe forest I mette a kny?te Ledand a birde bry?te; Ho wepput wundur sore. Þere togedur fa?te we, Bechesun of þat lady free; On werre þus hase he wonun me, Gif þat me lothe ware! XXIV Þis kny?te, þat is of renowun, Hase takyn me to presowun, And þu mun pay my rawunsun, Gawan, with þi leue.” Þen vnsquarutte Gauan, And sayd godely agayn, “I wille, wundur fayne; Quatt schall I geue?” “Quen þu art armut in þi gere, Take þi schild and þi spere, And ride to him a course on werre, Hit schall þe no?te greue.” Gauan asshes, “Is hit soe?” To toþer kny?t grauntus, “?oe;” He sayd, “Then togedur schull we goe, Howsumeuyr hit cheuis.” XXV And these kny?tus kithum hor crafte, And authir gripus a schafte, Was als rude as a rafte, So runnun þay togedur; So somun conne þa[y] hie, Þat nauthir scaput forbye; Gif Menealfe was þe more my?tie, ?ette dyntus gerut him to dedur. He stroke him sadde and sore, Squithe squonut he þore; Þe blonke him aboute bore, Wiste he neuyr quedur. Quod Kay, “Þu hase þat þu hase so?te, Mi rauunsun is allredy bo?te, Gif þu were ded I ne ro?te, Forþi come I hedur.” XXVI Þus Kay scornus þe kny?te, And Gauan rydus to him ry?te; In his sadul sette him on hi?te, Speke gif he may. Of his helme con he draw, Lete þe wynde on him blaw. He speke with a vois law, “Delyueryt hase þu Kay. With þi laa hase made him leyce, Butte him is lothe to be in pece, And þu was aye curtase, And prins of iche play; Wold þu here a stowunde bide, Anoþer course wold I ride; Þis þat houes by my side, In wedde I wold hur lay!” XXVII Thenne vnsquarut Gauan, Sayd godely agayn, “I am wundur fayn For hur for to fi?te.” These kny?tus kithum þay[re] gere, And aythir gripus a spere, Runnun togedur on werre, Os hardy and wi?te. So somen þat þay ?ode, Þat Gauan bare him fro his stede, Þat bothe his brees con blede On growunde qwen he li?te. Thenne Kay con on him calle, And sayd, “Sir, þu hade a falle, And þi wenche lost withalle, Mi trauthe I þe pli?te!” XXVIII Quod Kay, “Þi leue hase þu loste, For all þi brag or þi boste; If þu haue o?te on hur coste, I telle hit for tente.” Thenne speke Gauan to Kay, “A mons happe is notte ay, Is none so sekur of a say, Butte he may harmes hente.” Gauan rydus to him ry?te, And toke vppe þe toþer kny?te, Þat was dilfully dy?te, And stonet in þat stynte; Kay wurdus tenut him mare Þenne all þe harmes þat he hente þare. He sayd, “And we allone ware, Þis stryf schuld I stynte.” XXIX “?e, hardely!” quod Kay, “Butte þu hast lost þi fayre may, And þi liffe, I dar lay.” Þus talkes he him tille. And Gauan sayd, “God forbede, For he is du?ti in dede.” Prayes þe kny?te gud spede, To take hit to none ille If Kay speke wurdes kene. “Take þu þis damesell schene, Lede hur to Gaynour þe quene, Þis forward to fulfille; And say þat Gawan hur kny?te Sende hur þis byurde bri?te, And rawunsun þe anon ri?te, Atte hur awne wille.” XXX Þerto grawuntus þe kny?te, And truly his trauthe pli?te, Inne saueward þat byurde bry?te To Carlele to bringe. And as þay houet and abode, He squere on be squrd brode; Be he his othe hade made, Þenne waknut þe king. Þenne þe day beganne to daw, Þe kinge his bugull con blaw; His kny?tus couthe hitte welle knaw, His was a sekur thinge. Sethun thay busket hom ?are, Sqwith withowtun any mare, To wete þe kingus welefare, Withowtun letting. Primus Passus XXXI To þe forest þay take the way, Bothe Gawan and Kay, Menealfe and þe fare may, Comun to þe kinge. Þe bore brittunt þay funde, Was colurt of the kingus hunde; If he were lord of þat londe, He hade no horsing. Downe þay take þat birde bry?te, Sette hur one, behinde þe kny?te, Hur horse for þe king was dy?te, Withoutun letting; Gaue Kay þe venesun to lede, And hiet hamward gode spede; Bothe þe birde and þe brede, To Carlele þay bringe. XXXII Now as þay rode atte þe way, Þe kynge himseluun con say, Bothe to Gauan and to Kay, “Quere wan ?e þis wi?te?” Thenne Kay to þe king spake, He sayd, “Sir, in þe forest as I con wake, Atte þe anturis hoke, Þer mette me this kny?te; Þer togedur fa?te we, Bechesun of this lady fre; On werre hase he thus wonun me, With mayn and wythe my?te; And Gawan hase my rawunsun made, For a course þat he rode, And felle him in þe fild brode; He wanne þis biurde bry?te. XXXIII “He toke him þere to presunnere.” Þen loghe þat damesell dere, And louet with mylde chere, God and Sir Gawan. Þenne sayd þe king opon hi?te, All sqwithe to þe kny?te, “Quat is þi rawunsun opon ry?te, Þe sothe þu me sayn?” Þe tothir vnsquarut him with skille, “I conne notte say þe þertille, Hit is atte the quene wille, Qwi schuld I layne? Bothe my dethe and my lyfe, Is inne þe wille of þi wife, Quethur ho wulle stynte me of my strife, Or putte me to payne.” XXXIV “Grete God,” quod þe king, “Gif Gawan gode endinge, For he is sekur in alle kynne thinge To cowuntur with a kny?te; Of all playus he berus þe prise, Loos of þer ladies. Menealfe, and þu be wise, Hold þat þu behe?te, And I schall helpe þat I maye,” The king himseluun con saye. To Carlele þay take þe waye, And inne þe courte is li?te; He toke þis damesell gente, Before þe quene is he wente, And sayd, “Medame, I am hedur sente ffro Gawan, ?our kny?te.” XXXV He sayd, “Medame, Gawan ?our kny?te, On were hase wonun me tony?te; Bechesun of this birde bri?te, Mi pride conne he spille, And gerut me squere squyftely To bringe the this lady, And my nowne body, To do hit in þi wille; And I haue done as he me bade.” “Now,” quod þe quene, “and I am glade; Sethun þu art in my wille stade, To spare or to spille, I giffe þe to my lord, the kinge, For he hase mestur of suche a thinge, Of kny?tus in acowunturinge, Þis forward to fullfille.” XXXVI “Now,” þe quene sayd, “God Almy?te, Saue me Gawan, my kny?te, That þus for wemen con fi?te; Fro wothus him were!” Gawan sayd, “Medame, as God me spede, He is du?ti of dede, A blithe burne on a stede, And graythe in his gere.” Þenne þay fochet furthe a boke, All þayre laes for to loke, Þe kinge sone his othe toke, And squithely gerut him squere; And sekirly, withouten fabull, Þus dwellus he atte þe rowuntabull, As prest kny?te, and preuabull, With schild and with spere. XXXVII Nowe gode frindus ar þay; Þen carpus Sir Kay, To þe king con he say, “Sire, a mervaell thinke me, Of Bowdewyns avouyng, ?ustureuyn in þe eunyng, Withowtun any lettyng, Wele more thenne we thre.” Quod þe king, “Sothe to sayn, I kepe no lengur for to layn, I wold wete wundur fayn, How best my?te be.” Quod Kay, “And ?e wold gif me leue, And sithun take hit o no greue, Now schuld I propurly preue, As euyr my?te I thee.” XXXVIII “?isse,” quod þe king, “on þat couande, Þat o payn on life and on londe Þat ?e do him no wrunge, Butte saue wele my kny?te; As men monly him mete, And sithun forsette him þe strete. ?e fynde him no?te on his fete Bewarre, for he is wy?te; For he is horsutte full wele, And clene clad in stele; Is none of ?o but he mun fele, Þat he may only?te. ?e wynnun him no?te owte of his way,” Þe king himseluun con say, “Him is lefe, I dar lay, To hald þat he he?te.” XXXIX Þenne sex ar atte on assente, Hase armut hom, and furthe wente, Brayd owte aure a bente, Bawdewyn to mete; With scharpe weppun and schene, Gay gownus of grene To hold þayre armur clene, And were hitte fro þe wete. Thre was sette on iche side To werne him þe wayus wide; Quere þe kny?te schuld furthe ride, Forsette hym þe strete. With copus couert þay hom thenne, Ry?te as þay hade bene vncowthe men, For þat þay wold no?te be kennet, Euyn downe to þayre fete. XL Now as thay houut, and þay hyild, Þay so a schene vndur schild Þome prekand fast aure þe filde On a fayre stede; Wele armut and dy?te, As freke redy to fy?te, Toward Carlele ry?te He hies gode spede. He see þer sixe in his way; Þenne to þaymseluun con þay say, “Now he is ferd, I dar lay, And of his lyfe dredus.” Þen Kay crius opon he?te, All squythe to þe kny?te, “Othir flee or fi?te, Þe tone behouus þe nede!” XLI Þenne þay kest þayre copus hom fro, Sir Bawdewyn se þat hit wasse so, And sayd, “And ?e were als mony mo, ?e gerutte me notte to flee; I haue my ways for to weynde, For to speke with a frynde, As ?e ar herdmen hinde, ?e marre notte me!” Þenne þe sex sembult hom in fere, And squere, “By him þat bo?te vs dere Þu passus neuyr away here, Butte gif þu dede be!” “?isse! hardely,” quod Kay, “He may take anothir way, And þer schall no mon do nere say, Þat schall greue þe.” XLII “Gode the for?ilde,” quod the kny?te, “For I am in my wais ri?te; ?istureuyn I the king hi?te, To cumme to my mete; I warne ?o, frekes, be ?e bold, My ry?te ways wille I holde.” A spere in fewtre he foldes, A gode and a grete. Kay stode nexte him in his way; He jopput him aure on his play, Þat heuy horse on him lay; He squonet in þat squete. He rode to þere othir fyue, Þayre schene schildus con he riue, And faure felle he belyue, In his in þat hete! XLIII Hardely, withouten delay, Þe sex to hom hase takyn vppe Kay, And þenne Sir Bawdewin con say, “Will ?e any more?” Þe toþer vnsquarutte him þertille, Sayd, “Þu may weynd quere þu wille, For þu hase done vs no?te butte skille, Gif we be wowundut sore.” He brayd aure to þe kinge, Withowtun any letting; He asshed, if he hade herd any tithing In þayre holtus hore? Þe kny?te stedit and stode, Sayd, “Sir, as I come thro ?ondur wode, I herd ne se butte gode, Quere I schuld furthe fare.” XLIV Thanne was þe kinge ameruaylet þare That he wold telle him no more. Als squithur þay ar ?are, To masse ar thay wente. By þe masse wasse done, Kay come home sone; Told þe king before none, “We ar all schente Of Sir Baudewyn, ?our kny?te; He is nobull in þe fi?te, Bold, hardy, and wi?te To bide on a bente; ffle wille he neuyr more, Him is muche leuyr dee þore; I may banne hur þat him bore, Suche harmes haue I hente.” XLV Noue þe king sayd, “Fle he ne can, Ne werne his mete to no man; Gife any biurne schuld him ban, A meruail hit ware.” Þenne þe king cald his mynstrelle, And told him holly his wille— Bede him layne atte hit were stille— Þat he schuld furthe fare To Baudewins of Bretan. “I cummawunde þe or þu cum agayne, ffaurty days, o payne, Loke þat þu duelle þere; And wete me preuely to say If any mon go meteles away; For þi wareson for ay, Do þu me neuyrmore.” XLVI Then the mynstrell weyndus on his way Als fast as he may; Be none of þe thryd day He funde þaym atte þe mete— Þe lady and hur mene, And gestus grete plente; Butte porter none funde he, To werne him þe ?ate. Butte rayket into þe halle, Emunge þe grete and þe smalle, And loket aboute him aure alle; He herd of no threte; Butte riall seruys and fyne— In bollus birlutte þay þu wyne, And cocus in þe kechine, Squytheli con squete. XLVII Þen þe ladi conne he loute, And þe biurdes all aboute; Bothe withinne and withoute, No faute he þer fonde; Kny?te, squyer, ?oman, ne knaue, Hom lacket no?te þat þay schuld haue; Þay nedut notte aftur hit to craue, Hit come to hor honde. Þenne he wente to þe dece, Before þe pruddust in prece; Þat lady was curtase, And bede him stille stonde. He sayd he was knoun and couthe, And was comun fro bisouthe, And ho had myrth of his mouthe To here his tithand.

Bothe kny?te and squiere, Mynstrelle and messyngere, Pilgreme and palmere, Was welcum, I wene. Þer was plenty of fode, Pore men hade þayre gode, Mete and drinke or þay ?ode, To wete wytheoutyn wene; Þe lord lenge wold no?te, Butte come home, qwen him gode tho?te, And bothe he hase with him bro?te The kinge and þe quene. a ffitte XLIX Now þer come fro þe kechine Riall seruice and fine; Ther was no wonting of wine, To lasse ne to mare.

Þen sayd þe kinge opon hi?te, All sqwithe to þe kny?te, “Suche a seruice on a ny?te Se I neuyr are.” Þenne Bawdewyn smylit, and on him loghe, Sayd, “Sir, God hase a gud plu?e, He may send vs all enughe, Qwy schuld we spare?” L “Now I cummawunde þe,” quod þe king, “Tomorne in þe mornyng, Þat þu weynde on huntyng, To wynne vs þe dere; ffare furthe to þe fenne, Take with þe howundus and men, For þu conne hom best kenne, Þu knoes best here. ffor all day tomorne will I bide, And no forthir will I ride, Butte with þe lades of pride, To make me gud chere.” To bed bownut þay þat ny?te, And att þe morun, atte days li?te, Þay blew hornys opon hi?te, And ferd furthe in fere. LI Þenne þe kynge cald his huntere, And sayd, “Felaw, come here.” Þe toþer, with a blithe chere, Knelet on his kne; Dowun to þe kinge con he lowte. “I commawunde þe to be all ny?te oute; Bawdewyn, þat is sturun and stowte, With þe schall he be. Erly in þe dawyng, Loke þat ?e come fro huntyng— If ?e no venesun bring, ffull litill rechs me.” Þe toþer vnsquarut him þertille, Sayd, “Sir, þat is atte ?our aune wille, That hald I resun and skille, As euyr my?te I the.” LII And atte euyn þe king con him dy?te, And callut to him a kny?te, And to þe chambur full ri?te, He hiees gode waye, Qwere þe lady of þe howse, And maydyns full beuteowse, Were curtase and curiowse, ffor sothe in bed lay.

Worlyke in wede, He sayd, “Lye downe preuely hur by, Butte neghe no?te þu that lady, For and þu do, þu shall dey For þi derfe ded; Ne no?te so hardy þu stur, Ne onus turne þe to hur; Þe toþer sayd, “Nay, sur;” For him hade he drede.

To þe chaumbur he takes þe way, He fyndus þe king atte his play, A kny?te in his bedde lay, With his lady. Þenne sayd þe king opon hi?te, “Tony?te myssutte I my kny?te, And hithir folut I him ry?te, Here funden is hee; And here I held hom bothe stille, ffor to do hom in þi wille; And gif þu take hit now till ille, No selcouthe thinge me.” LVII Þen þe king asshed, “Art þu wrothe?” “Nay, sir,” he sayd, “withouten othe, Ne wille þe lady no lothe, I telle ?o as quy: For hitte was atte hur awen wille, Els thurt no mon comun hur tille; And gif I take hitte þenne to ille, Muche maugreue haue Y, For mony wyntur togedur we haue bene, And ?ette ho dyd me neuyr no tene, And iche syn schall be sene, And sette full sorely.” Þe king sayd, “And I hade þo?te Quy þat þu wrathis þe no?te, And fyndus him in bed bro?te, By þi laydy?” LVIII Quod Bawdewyn, “And ?e will sitte, I schall do ?o wele to witte;” “?isse,” quod þe king, “I þe hete, And þu will no?te layne.” “Hit befelle in ?our fadur tyme, Þat was þe kyng of Costantyne, Puruayed a grete oste and a fyne, And wente into Spayne.

Bede bringe bred plente, And wine in bollus of tre, Þat no wontyng schuld be, To lasse ne to mare. We hade no mete, butte for one day; Hit come in a nobull aray. Þe messyngere lokit ay, And se hom sle care; He toke his leue atte me[te]. We gerutte him drinke atte þe ?ate, And gafe him giftus grete, And furthe con he fare. LXIX “But quen þe messyngere was gone, Þese officers ichone To me made þay grete mone, And drerely con say; Sayd, ‘In this howse is no bred, No quyte wine nyf red; ?o behoues ?ild vppe þis stid, And for oure lyuys pray.’ ?ette God helpus ay his man; Þe messyngere come agayn þan, Withoute to þe cheuytan, And sone conne he say, ‘Þo?he ?e sege þis seuyn ?ere, Castell gete ?e none here, ffor þay make als mirry chere, Als hit were ?ole day!’ LXX “Þen þe messyngere con say, ‘I rede ?o, hie ?o heþinne away, For in ?our oste is no play, Butte hongur and thurst.’ Þenne þe king con his kny?tis calle, Sethinne to cowunsell wente þay all; ‘Sythinne no bettur may befall, This hald I þe best.’ Euyn atte þe mydny?te, Hor lordis sembelet to a sy?te, Þat were hardy and wi?te; Þay remuyt of hor rest. Mete laynes mony lakke, And þere mete hor sege blak brake; And gerut hom to giffe vs þe bake, To preke þay were full preste. LXXI “And þen we lokit were þay lay, And see oure enmeys away, And þen oure felawis con say, Þe lasse and þe mare, He þat gode may gete, And wernys men of his mete, Gud Gode, þat is grete, Gif him sory care! ffor the mete of þe messyngere, Hit mendutte all oure chere.” Þen sayd þe king, þat þay my?te here, And sqwythely con squere, “In þe conne we fynde no fabull, Thine avowes arne profetabull.” And þus recordus þe rowndetabull, Þe lasse and þe more. LXXII Thenne þe kinge and his kny?tis all, Þay madun myrthe in þat halle, And þen þe lady conne þay calle, The fayrist to fold; Sayde, “Bawdewyn, and þu be wise Take þu þis lady of price For muche loue in hur lyce; To þinne hert hold. Ho is a biurde full bry?te, And þerto semely to þy si?te, And þu hase holdinne all þat þu hi?te As a kni?te schulde!” Now Jhesu Lord, heuyn kynge, He graunt vs alle his blessynge And gife vs all gode endinge, That made vs on þe mulde!</field>
