      <field name="fulltext">A RESEMBLANCE As Orpheus flower and fern Called to his knees, And by delicious tones Ravished the trees, Forcing the oaks and poplars high, Lissom as maids, to change their sky; So April's lovelier voice Calls to the birds. Hearing delicious tones, Ravishing words, Pipits with tiny cousins fly, Nimble as dreams, to change their sky. THE CHEATED LOVER How sharp a punishment to bear Alone this beauty of the pear That, dressed for bridal, bids me think Of her whose robes are blue and pink! Would she but imitate the pear, And on her lovely body wear The bridal clothes at last for me, How gay this shadowed heart could be! When comes the gloaming she will give Fair reasons for my life to live, And yet will beg to have the bliss Of staying Cupid's chrysalis. Remember, Clovermaid, how fair A frock this tree is glad to wear, And scorn to let a rival shine Through veilings lovelier than thine! TO A SNOWDROP Wert thou as warm as thou art white, Then would'st thou seem the perfect friend For me to gather ere the night Invokes her dewiness, and send To her upon whose bosom's swell The sisters, Warmth and Whiteness, dwell. But it were sacrilege to give A gift less radiant than the place Where beds of breathing snowdrops live And wonder how my exiled face Endures so long to lose the sight Of them, and lilies just as white. THE GREAT BEECH With heart disposed to memory, let me stand Near this monarch and this minstrel of the land, Now that Dian leans so lovely from her car. Illusively brought near by seeming falsely far, In yon illustrious summit sways the tangled evening star. From trembling towers of greenery there heaves In glorious curves a precipice of leaves. Superbly rolls thy passionate voice along, Withstander of the tempest, grim and strong, When at the wind's imperative thou burstest into song. Still must I love thy gentle music most, Utterly innocent of challenge or of boast, And playmate of the sun's adoring beam. Close kindred to thy softer tremblings seem The sighs of her I covet, when she kindles in a dream. Oft at thy branching altar have I knelt, Searched for the secret, and thy lesson spelt Before the athletes of the night had done Their starry toil and joyous beams had run To melt that ancient silversmith who loves the set of sun. When Spring was budding in my heart anew, Thy prayer for foliage soared into the blue. Within thy branches myriad children heard: Pale were their lips and fingers as they stirred And promised leafiness enough to tempt thy favourite bird. Quick was the wonder to amaze my sight: Where stood the leafless suppliant towered a knight Green to the helm and touching lips with May! Far on the hill the wheatstalks stopped from play To call across the valley love to leaves more fine than they. Then wert thou vocal, hospitable king! Safe in thy heart the birds were glad to sing, For dove and stormcock to thy breast had come; And at the perfect hour a moony foam And starlight fell upon the thrush that made thy bosom home. As gentle gatherer of the weary wing, Happy to quaff from the eternal spring That damps the woodwren's feather-swollen breast, Thou lendest to my heart a deeper rest, Working with priceless balm a miracle for thy guest. On thee, in green and sunshine greatly stoled, Thy kindred of the undulating wold Obeisance, as befits their stature, spend: Sweet is the embassy, with wind for friend, When lofty limes of Todenham Church their fragrant homage send. Rightly they worship. Rightly comes the maid To look for love beneath thy bounteous shade; Rightly as these the village children haste, And with their sunburned fingers interlaced Fasten a living girdle round thy cool and stalwart waist. For games and grief thou hast an equal heart, Giving to all petitioners the needed part. Often I ask the shape of him who fled To drink of knowledge at the fountain-head: He pulses in the shadow as a fugitive from the dead. Old noble of the county, once we twain Beneath thy roof discoursed of bliss and pain; And, looking upward for the star Content, Laughed deep at soul to watch the sunbeams sent In coveys glittering all along the field of firmament. If ever the travelled spirit can return Where once in earthly bliss 'twas proud to burn In hard-won triumph over resolute clay, 'Tis here my friend shall fold his wings and stay To fill my unforgetting heart with tremulous holiday. The tryst is here. Brother, I shall not fail Whether in summer's ripeness, winter's hail. Come most in Autumn's sympathetic charms, When opal hazes touch the red-roofed farms, And in the night the beech-tree holds the red moon in his arms. And tell me, Brother, if the shining plan Of resurrection chooses only man; If every friend of plain and upland dies. For I would have this turreted tree arise To lord it over beeches in the forest of Paradise. Fast in the ample chamber of his bole There dwells, perchance, an unintelligible soul Destined to tower in some celestial wold, Where you and I, conversing as of old, May watch the Alps of Heaven become as mountains made of gold. Or bend to watch how cunningly the Earth Tangles our kin in webs of tears and mirth, And soils them even as they fly the stain; And, seeing this, may find that Heaven is vain To keep earth-broken hearts from breaking in Heaven again Till shines the hour when Home is truly Home, With all the brave and dear familiars come: Assembled ripely in the lustrous sheaf Of Love, and radiant in divine relief From Joy that used to spoil the earth by whispering to Grief. THE REVIEW One Sabbath, just as eve was come, When musings all were sleepy-fair, Sunshiny Wakefulness ran home And left me dreaming in my chair. At once I searched among the flowers Of Heaven to find my mother's face: By beds of musk, in lilac bowers, And near laburnums' golden grace. I could not. Then I dreamed I woke With trouble aching in my brain, Till on my startled vision broke A sight to make me young again; For radiant in the window-seat My mother sat with downward look Intently reading (how unmeet For eyes so fair!) my latest book. At last, when all the book was read, She gave a happy little nod, Drooped lower still her gracious head, Kissed it, and faded back to God. THE HIDDEN WEALTH Adam and Eve together stood Amid the crop they both were tending, While far away the feathery wood Of Eden in the wind was bending. And Adam, feeling in his veins The better for his splendid tussle, Laughed at his body for its pains, And showed to Eve his hardening muscle. Fine was the bread his sweat had earned, Despite the fields of rock and thistle, While daily wounds and baulkings turned His olden softness into gristle. So, thinking deeply of the life Of chartered idleness and blisses, Sudden he seized his comely wife And took her mouth by storm with kisses. ‘Dear heart!’ he cried, ‘we fare the best When earth and labour roughly grapple. Who could have thought the only rest Worth having, centred in an apple!’ PAYMENT Master of the orchard, Pay me for the pears, Render for my cherries Star-delaying airs: Pouring from the apple Lyrical delight, Warm the cheek of Evening, Touch the heart of Night! Master of the orchard, Perching to rejoice, How the sweet of childhood Trembles in your voice! Lo, the narrow garden Misty at my feet! Here a camp of crocus, There a patch of wheat. Master of the orchard, Sing for me again Blossoms of the homeland, Grasses in the lane: Sing my cottage cradle, Sing my mother's eyes, Sweeter than the dog-rose, Bluer than the skies. Master of the orchard, When again the Spring Teaches you her ballads, Gives the glossy wing, Flit among the branches, Pipe your jolly airs, Fluting thanks for cherries, Paying for the pears. CUPID'S ARROW Once I called him till he woke From his dreamy resting Underneath the giant oak Where he stayed his questing: Better had I flung my heart In the June-bright river Than have bared it for a dart Out of such a quiver! Many years away have run Since the Archer shot me, Half in passion, half in fun, Wounded and forgot me. Safely now he falls asleep Where my hands could take him; For the arrow went so deep That I dare not wake him. THE MOWER'S VISION The dawn was cradled in the skies When from the hut beneath the hill The mower came and turned his eyes On sleepy grasslands by the mill. He whistled as he strode along A shrill good-morrow to the lark That, linking earth to heaven with song, Shook from his breast the tuneless dark. ‘Come, come,’ said Richard to his scythe, ‘What say you? Shall we mow, my lass?’ And so in royal weather They swung as mates together In dewy deeps of fragrant grass. As Richard mowed, his father's corn Whispered and curtsied in his way; There rose the farm where he was born, And one sweet bush of double-may. Once more, beside the ancient clock, He heard in rustic piety His mother share with all her flock The old brown Bible on her knee. ‘Come, come,’ said Richard to his scythe, ‘What say you? Shall we rest, my lass? And so in ruddy weather They sat them down together, And viewed long lanes of fallen grass. And, musing there beside his blade, The dreamer saw a flowery cot Where lived (ah! wounds of love!) the maid That knew his hope, but loved him not. He watched her lips in wonder part; His brother entered proud and blithe; And as she kissed him, Richard's heart Fell in a tear upon his scythe. ‘Come, come,’ said Richard drearily, ‘What say you? Shall we mow, my lass?’ And so in cloudy weather They swung and sighed together Along the graveyard of the grass. TO CANTERBURY BELLS Many blossoms to my breast Make a sweet appeal: Lily with the snowy crest, Solomon his seal. Glad am I in spring to learn All the violet tells; But of all the coloured host You, fair friends, I love the most, Ringing bells, singing bells, Canterbury Bells! Through the days of innocence Marvel was my food; Then I stormed the angry fence Scowling round the wood: Not for daffodils I searched In the warmer dells, But I sought the wood-king bold In his helm of beaten gold, Gleaming bells, dreaming bells, Canterbury Bells! When the forest made my heart Quiver in despair, Sad because its leafiest part Hid no warrior there, Mother taught me all the hedge, Took me to the fells, Filled my hands with deep delights— Petalled monarchs, flowering knights— Swaying bells, playing bells, Canterbury Bells! In her garden she would stroke Cage and cup of blue, While with joyful love she spoke, Homeland bells, of you. Even now her voice (it flows From remembered wells) Pours within my ears the praise Poured on you in happier days, Blowy bells, snowy bells, Canterbury Bells! That was long ago. Her end Like a blossom shows. Never shall the Gardener tend Such another rose. God be thanked, her spotless soul In a heaven dwells Where her brow is cooled by trees And your kindred kiss her knees, Calling bells, falling bells, Canterbury Bells! THE OLD PIANO The old piano must not go As rubbish to an upper-room, Where crippled sofas, tables, chairs With dust and spiders stand in gloom. Beautiful maids and lordly lads And grandsires grey together give A treasure to the instrument, A lavender that needs must live. To boys and girls the instrument Has stood for misery and fears; And even now the ivory shows The smudges made of dirt and tears. While the lank spinster, full of starch, On knuckles rapped with frequent force, The children past the quavers looked To bears and Indians in the gorse. The lad of twenty made the tramp Of regiments pass along the keys; He looked across the world and saw The blood of England stain the leas: Sudden the scarlet horsemen poured In thousands down the ivory lane, The flag in front, and shouting hurled The wild-eyed foe across the plain. The old piano knew the sweet Bewildering of the maid's unrest Before with tears and sighs she found An Eden on her mother's breast. 'Twas in a summerhouse of sound She trembled to the touch of bliss, And felt her heart of pearbloom take The arrow of her lover's kiss. The woman never blessed to bend Above a cradle sweetly filled Unrobed in melody the babes That flocked the keyboard as she willed: Lullabies wooed to perfect sleep The children called from fairyland, As patiently she covered up The little chest, the little hand. At evenfall a bride has played A son or daughter on the notes, And stitched in cadences a stock Of pinafores and tiny coats; Has in the treble set a maid, And in the alto put a boy, With evening pauses, lark-like trills, And octaves bursting out of joy. The old piano must not go As rubbish to an upper-room, Where crippled sofas, tables, chairs With dust and spiders stand in gloom: Surely it joins of infancy And age the sleep-defended poles, This rosewood colony of shapes Too fragile even to be souls. THE WORST Nightly, bereft of Mercy's beam, I dreamed the thrice-bewildering dream That shakes the turrets of my brain Beneath a tempest of disdain. At last the lamp of mercy burned: Away from wretchedness I turned, And in a Canaan of delight Found grapes and honey rush to sight. My bed a miracle confessed! For in it breathed a girlish breast, And on my pillow blossomed fair The face that never can be there. ‘Are you awake?’ I said to her; ‘Are you awake, my Lavender?’ But as I spoke, from dreamland's mesh The girl flew back again to flesh. Then loud I cried to Agony, ‘Take not thy sport by maiming me! Pierce with the thrice-bewildering dart, But never show that lovely heart!’ TO CHRISTOPHER Barely have you made a start On the road that I have travelled Leagues and leagues toward the part Where its meaning is unravelled, Christopher. As I hold you, bathed and gowned, While your mother's happy face is Sign enough that you have found Here on earth a sweet oasis, I am thinking of that night When the Virgin was unable Otherwhere to ease her plight Than within a narrow stable; When the startled oxen near Wondered at the strange declaring Of the beam, so more than clear, Jesu's little brow was wearing. On the birthday of the Lord, You, a rush of joy compelling, Came to bring the full accord Love allows where love is dwelling. Thus it is I think of Him On His Mother's bosom lying In a stable cold and dim, Hearing love, but not replying. Surely Joseph, kneeling there In the litter to caress Him, Must have pledged his heart to bear All it could to help and bless Him. Thinking this, I vow to stand Near your side when you are older, Just to steady with my hand Any cross upon your shoulder. Ah, I feel the man in me Almost woman while I press you Close against the soul to be Happy only if it bless you, Christopher! WITH A ROSE Take it and wear it! If it were half as sweet As the breast to bear it, Even for you, I could hardly spare it. Reigning, 'twill wonder Deep at your lake-like eyes; At its image under Sparkles and mist; And your heart's low thunder. Thus shall this rose's Home be an exquisite home, Where the Spring ne'er closes The snowdrop's life, And herself reposes. Take it and wear it! When it has kissed the heart I desire to bear it, Send it me back, That our breasts may share it. AT VARLEY As my sunny self went homing In the loveliness of gloaming Through the hedges looking over Little continents of clover, Nought to me was all the treasure Kings and Emperors can measure, Since the Child Beloved was waiting For my heart's tumultuous mating There at Varley. Near the honeysuckle's wreathing (Hardly sweeter is the breathing Of the Child Beloved) a wonder Took my heart with Cupid's thunder, And my veins were all a-filling With a kind of precious thrilling That compelled my lips to rushes Of a song as ripe as thrush's In the evening. Then I guessed her come from Varley By the field-path through the barley To the roadway's leafy turning, There with Love and frolic burning. How my arms went fire-fast round her When beside the thorn I found her In the old blue muslin waiting For my heart's tumultuous mating Close to Varley! THE SHAME While Love on him was playing In bounty from above, I heard a rich man saying He had no time for love! Had not this shame been spoken Too oft by foolish men, I think God's heart had broken To hear it uttered then. To rise with love at morning, Go home with love at night, Is still the best adorning To keep the bosom bright. A SONG [Give me to hold] Give me to hold That lovely, lovely hand, Violet-veined and lily-white, Fairest in the land! Give me to hold That lovely, lovely hand; For Cupid, pouting, swears that he Lipped none so soft in Arcady. Give me to kiss That honied, honied mouth, Cupid-curved and tremulous, Spicier than the South! Give me to kiss That honied, honied mouth, And I will count Apollo's joy, Had Daphne stumbled, but a toy! Give me to share That haunting, haunting breast Snow allied with lavender, Resting-place of Rest! Give me to share That haunting, haunting breast, And I will laugh to think how Love Gave only crumbs of bliss to Jove. THE BALANCE Once I was a woodlad A million years ago; And once you were a woodgirl A million years ago. Though Memory wearies to unwind The darkling story from her mind, The words are few and stiff and slow, Because of trances in the grave. But yet she whispers, it was well (Very well—ah, very well!) When I was but a woodlad, And you were but a woodgirl, A million years ago. Dreaming in the woodland, I taste the Long Ago— The berries and the honey A million years ago. The air is quivering while you grace With scented grass our resting-place; And knowing naught, I seem to know The bird I snared to bring a smile Upon our boy's enchanting face (Our little son's delicious face!) When I was but a woodlad, And you were but a woodgirl, A million years ago. Dimly in the woodland There come from Long Ago The shadows of my blisses A million years ago: Beneath a starry coverlet True love against my heart is set In flow of joy, and overflow Too lovely not to have its price. To-day we pay with lashes wet (Would God that only mine were wet!) For what we held as woodlad (Remember, Love!) and woodgirl A million years ago. THE FRECKLES To others leave The cunning care of speckles; Why should'st thou grieve To have a hundred freckles? They suit so well, 'Twere sad indeed to miss them, Or not to tell The number as I kiss them. If Beauty fails Her charms and traps to vary Herself she stales, And loses the unwary. The golden flakes, By thee denounced as stupid, Enhance the lakes Where swims a childlike Cupid. From white to white's A journey less entrancing Than one whose lights With various tints are glancing. Be sure this nest Of freckles for my praising But gives thy breast A clearness more amazing! UNMELTED Ask me not, Friend, to ramble from the books Sounding with birds and freshets of the Spring; For all along the landscape show the signs Of Winter's playmate roaring in the pines, And Frost, his wand uplifted, darkly stills The river deep in dreams of June-bright mills. Not yet the snow is melted on the hills. So with the maid whom most of all I need. Lovely in ignorance, she calmly views The torrents in my eyes and thinks them pools Where Simpleness her brow in lustre cools. There's waiting to be done, my heart, ere fills Her frost-bound breast with discomposing thrills! Not yet the snow is melted on the hills. FAIR FORTUNE Where merchantman with merchant meets, To bandy terms of more and less, Came Laura through the London streets In earth-delighting heavenliness. The sun, by her compelled to shine, Made up a posy of his heat, And bared his face. She wanted mine, And searched for me along the street. At last she flushed the selfsame pink I'd kissed her to, twelve hours ago, And halted, giddy on the brink Of joy her bosom ached to know. And as with gradual warmth she thrilled, And Love half-listened to Desire, She pressed against my side and filled My every vein with happy fire. Then, while I watched this girl adorn The street, as swans adorn a lake, I thanked Apollo I was born A minstrel for her lovely sake. THE LOVER TO HIS DEAD MISTRESS Night after night, Eurydice, I tremble at thy homing To pillows long deserted, with lips and hands forbidden: I cannot bear the agonies that scorch me at thy coming With so little beauty showing, with so much of beauty hidden! To hear thee breathing by the bed, to feel thy fingers stroking The nest thy body sweetened once, is peril near to madness. Sleep in thy grave, Eurydice, by memories invoking, Nor work so bitterly to give a double-edge to sadness. Have I not bought the sullen ground that waits for me above thee, In promise of the summer when they bring to thee my starkness? Keep in thy grave, Eurydice, remembering how I love thee, Nor break me on the wheel at night by breathing in the darkness! THE PUZZLED THRUSH For sure there's something in my bones to-day That makes my body restless as a breeze, And drives me, whimsical, from spray to spray In search of what is never in the trees. The rosy goodwife's bunching snowdrops took Me steadily by charm a fortnight since, But now the garden is a fevered nook— So mused Sir Feathery Fullthroat on the quince. I asked the cocksure Robin if he knew The kind of ailment bubbling in my breast. He flung his noddle backward, eyed the blue, And puffed the scarlet jersey on his chest: ‘My precious hobbledehoy’ quoth he, ‘'tis March! Expect a pang, for Love is in the air.’ On this he chased Robina to a larch— So mused Sir Feathery Fullthroat in the pear. 'Tis true I've wanted very much all day To know where Nancy Nonesuch has removed, And why she's changed her January way Of suffering me beside her unreproved. Ah! There she stands in sunshine at the brink Of yonder thread of stream, with eyes more bright Than water's self! The dear! I think—I think (So mused Sir Feathery Fullthroat) Robin's right! TO MY MOTHER The more I live, the more I look Amazedly behind, Astonished by the pains you took To help my early mind; Astonished by the bitter-sweet Insistence of the dart With which you fought me, to defeat Old mischiefs in my heart; Astonished by the load of smiles, Of prayers, of secret tears, You must have dropped along the miles That led to Twenty Years; Astonished by the radiant truth My inward sight can see— That you would give your angel-youth To fall from heaven for me. TRUTH IN SILENCE I have made you a song, my dear, Because I love you; Because there is nobody here In the world above you: It is only a simple song Of a heart's deep pining To have the hidden revealed By a constant shining. But a shadow of truth, my dear, Is seen when I find you Suddenly turned to me here As I step behind you: Though the lips have never a word, Thank Love for the token Unwarily kept! It is more Than a silence broken. TO A BLACKBIRD Deep in the lilac, Pulsing with tune, Richly you warble Promise of June. Brother, you call me Out to the Spring, Even as Blondel Called to the King. Blondel sang England, Dear and desired; Blondel sang England, Leafily shired. Then was the prison Broken by words Smelling of cowslips, Flashing with birds! Now, as I labour, Weary for play, England you carol, England in May. Seems it that Blondel, Vanquishing death, Lives in your bosom, Sings with your breath. Here at my window Surely you sing Double the sweetness Heard by the King: Deep in the lilac, Merrily met, Blackbird and Blondel Sing a duet! THE SHEPHERD'S SONG Marry me, marry me, Nancy! Come, settle you down and be cheery! Too long have you kept me aching, Too long have you held me weary. Since there's not on the moorland a shepherd To love you so heartily, Deary, Marry me, marry me, marry me, Settle you down and be cheery! Marry me, marry me, Nancy! Let's settle us down and be double! 'Tis time we were Christianly handfast And out of this starving trouble. Since you mope for no handsomer shepherd To burn with a kissing, my Deary, Sign to the long-tailed parson, Settle you down and be cheery! See in my grandmother's teapot Ten metal-made buttercups blowing! So long as I've loved you, Nancy, So long have these flowers been growing. Since there's not in the valley a shepherd Can keep you so feather-fine, Deary, Make me your man at the altar, Settle you down and be cheery! SPION KOP Five minutes more, O Honey of my heart, Although it be the cradle-hour, And sleep be growing like a flower From out the nursery floor! Five minutes more, To feel the agony of tenderness Shake all the spires and belfries of my soul! The very ropes are singing; the very stones are ringing As I tremble at thy brightness, as I flutter at thy mouth, And ache with fearful happiness, Star of my bosom's south! Five minutes more, O Honey of my heart, Although it be the cradle-hour, And petals from the sleeping-flower Begin to strew the floor! Five minutes more, To clasp a kingdom in thy slenderness, Warming by thee thy father in his grave. Not wholly have they slain him; thy borrowings contain him, For I stroke him on thy forehead, from thy lips his lips come forth, Thou wound and cure together! Thou rainbow of my north! THE ROBIN Bird of the scarlet breast, Whose genius is not hidden, But, though by Winter chidden, Preserves a glorious zest, Could I but sing as thou Upon my heart's bare bough! Could I, when storms of grief Have buffeted and shaken, Be never so forsaken But that of song the leaf, The bud, the flower, should dress My other nakedness! Could I from youth to age Remember to enclose thee, And all thy wisdom shows me, Within my bosom's cage, Keeping as balm for smart A redbreast in my heart! THE WELCOME Upon his couch, with body spoiled, Year after year the sick man lay, And, forcing Courage onward, toiled To help the helpers of his way. If Mercy passed the simple cot, Or Anguish entered by surprise, Within his heart he kept a grot For Cheerfulness, and lifted eyes That never ceased to offer Pain A battleground (Ah, sacred room, For those who loved him you remain A temple sweet with holy bloom!) At heart of night in middle May, Soundless as if on moss he stepped, The powerful Reaper thrust his way Past all who knelt and prayed and wept. From glazing eyes a welcome sped Was lovelier than the loveliest star, As brokenly the sufferer said, ‘Why, Friend, how—very late—you are! THE CHILD ASLEEP Lilybabe, you want to go To a world away from mother Where the velvet waters flow Soundlessly to one another Through enchanted Faraway. Evening eyelids, evening breast, Tell me you must wander west In a maze of mystery, While, methinks, your lips confess Neither breath nor breathlessness, Lilybabe. Glad were I to see you go, Lilybabe, upon this travel, Could the water noisier flow Over beds of ruby gravel In the streams of Faraway. But heartbreakingly you lie Past the power to move or sigh, Till my very spirit bleeds From the fear that Wonder's foam Never more will drift you home, Lilybabe. THE REFUGE Home again to Birdlip! Cries the heart, the heart Aching in the thunder Of the gloomy mart— Home again to Birdlip And the quivering breast Honeyful, honeyful In the west. Home again to Birdlip And the golden musk Breathing at the window In the dewy dusk— Home again to Birdlip And the pulsing night Bosomful, bosomful Of delight! THE APPEAL If you had been in Birdsey Wood Last Wednesday afternoon, Where, frocked in muslin, once you stood As April breathing June, You might have thought that near the glade Beyond the Druids' stone You heard Pan trolling in the shade His vigorous baritone. For there I lay along the moss And sang to ancient skies A ballad heavy with the loss I suffer when your eyes Reveal to lads in other shires Blue limpidness, and teach Their heart the burden of desires That run away from speech. Ah, come, my dear! The baby oak We measured by your length Is waiting for your hands to stroke His bark and thrill his strength. Come, with a sob, to find the place Where long ago you stood, And fill my arms with pulsing grace Once more in Birdsey Wood! WEARY HEART AND WEARY HEAD To Weary Heart cried weary Head, ‘Sweeter the day if I were dead, For I have called farewell to Christ, And every joy is over-priced: Each precious and inspiring friend Already knows the graveyard end, And round me bitterness is shed,’ To Weary Heart cried Weary Head. To Weary Head cried Weary Heart, ‘He made the balm who made the smart. Though sundered ever from the breast Where throbs my lilied chance of rest, And though I languish every day That Agony shall have her play, Handlocked with Hope I bear my part,’ To Weary Head cried Weary Heart. VITAL MOMENTS When Eve looked close at her son, and saw A shadowy Adam alive on his face, Then, with a beauty was better than law, Lovely Fidelity flowered in the place. When Adam moved from his Love, to scan Across the river the beckoning brake, Then was the birth of adventurous man Dicing with Death for Uncertainty's sake. When Abel lay in the noontide heat, A clod by the altar, bloody and lorn, Then did the Christ on his Heavenly seat Taste of the vinegar, groan in the thorn. TO A PROUD BEAUTY The cloud that sails, A silver lamb in blue, Not long prevails By innocence of hue. The stream that goes Like violets melted there, In rains and snows Is neither blue nor fair. The star that takes The wilderness with joy Time's hammer breaks, The rods of heaven destroy. Then be not proud That beauty loves to wear Thy face, thy cloud Of king-compelling hair. For like a dream The loveliness shall pass: A flash, a beam, A breathing on the glass! Thou dost not think That June perceives the way Toward the brink Of beauty in decay; But thither tend Thy bosom-breaking charms Where Death shall bend Thee backward in his arms! BABE OF BABES The Child has opened His eyes Where the ox is bound, And yet is the truest king In the wide world found. We all should bend on this day To the Child of grace, And lift Him out of the straw To a better place. For every heart is the home He will best adorn, Making a cradle of each On this Christmas morn. THE LOSS Ah, had'st thou either gone or stayed! For often when I swiftly turn I find thee in the olden chair; Not mortal, and not half so fair As when, in honest earth arrayed, Thou wast the bosom of my care. Ah, hadst thou either gone or stayed! Less lovely as an angel, still Thy loveliness so sharpens pain That blood of grief renews its stain, And suddenly my heart, afraid Of being broken, breaks again. AN ENVOY TO THE BOOK If you go for a thousand miles to the right, And again for a thousand miles, With your wavering star for single light, And your soul half tears, half smiles; Then over a hundred mountains go, And into a hundred vales, A pilgrim between the rose and the snow, The eagles and nightingales; Perhaps you will find in a thousand hours, If you laugh at the need of rest, The girl with the heart of breathing flowers Too fair for a woman's breast. If you home at last on her gentle knee, By laces and muslins kissed, I bid you a voluble blackcap be, With songs of love-in-a-mist.</field>
