      <field name="fulltext">PVBLII. OVIDII NASONIS DE ARTE AMANDI: OR, The Art of Loue. The Proheme or Introduction. If there be any in this multitude, That in the art of Loue is dull and rude, Me let him reade, and these my lines rehearse, He shall be made a Doctor by my verse. By art of sailes and oares Seas are diuided, By art the Chariot runnes: by art Loue's guided: By art are bridles rein'd in, or let slip: Typhis by art did guide the Hemonian ship. And me hath Venus her Arts master made, To teach her Science, and set up her trade: And time succeeding shall call me alone, Loue's expert Tiphis and Antomedon. Loue in himself is apish and vntoward, Yet being a child, Ile whip him when he's froward: Achilles in his youth was taught to run On the stringd Lute a sweete diuision: Art on his rude and sterne aspect did cease, Instructing him in old Philerides: He that so oft his friends, so oft his foes, Made quake and tremble when he would disclose. His furious rage was knowne to be a Sutor, And with submission kneele vnto his Tutor: Ãneides by Chiron was instructed, And by my arts loue himselfe conducted, Both goddes sonnes, Venus and Thetis ioyes, Both shrewd, both waggish, and vnhappy boyes: Yet the stiffe Bulls necke by the yoake is worne, The proud Steed chewes the bit which he doth scorn And though Loues darts my owne heart cleaues asunder, Yet by my art the wag shall be kept vnder, And the more deep my flaming heart is found, The more I will reuenge me of my wound; Sacred Apollo witnesse of my flame, Behold thy arts I do not falsly clame, Of Clios sisters, loe I take no keepe, That in the vale of Asca feede their sheepe. Proud skie I teach of what I haue beene taster, Loue bids me speake Ile be your skilfull master: And what I speake is true thus I beg in Be present at my labours loues faire Queene. Keep hence you modest maids and come not neare, That vse to blush and shamefast garments weare, That haue scant ruffes &amp; keepe your haire vnseene, Whose feet with your white aprons couered beene From Vertas virgins here no place is left, My muse sings Venus spoiles and Loues sweet theft, What kinde affections louers thoughts do pierse, And there shall be no fault in this my verse; FINIS. THE FIRST BOOKE. First thou that art a Freshman and art bent, To beare Loues armes and follow Cupids tent, Find whom to loue, the next thing thou must doe, Learne how to speake her faire, to pleade and woe: Last hauing wonne thy Mistris to thy lure, Ile teach thee how to make that loue endure, This is my aime, Ile keep within this space And in this road my Chariot wheele shall trace. Whilst thou liuest free and art a Batcheler, The loue of one aboue the rest preferre: To whom thy soule sayes, you alone content me. But such a one shall not from heauen be sent thee, Such are not dropt downe from the azure skies, But thou must seeke her out with busie eyes: Well knowes the Huntsman where his toyle to set, And in what denne the Boare his teeth doth whet: Well knowes the Fowler where to lay his gin, The fisher knowes what poole most fish are in, And thou that studiest to become a louer, Learne in what place most Virgins to discouer. I do not bid thee saile the Seas to seeke, Or trauell farre to find one thou dost like. Like Perseus that among the Negroes sought, And faire Andromade from Inde brought: Or Paris who to steale that daintie peece, Trauelld as farre as betwixt Troy and Greece, Behold the populous Citie in her pride, Yeelds thee more choice then all the world beside. More eares of ripe corne growes not in the fields, Nor halfe so many boughes the Forrest yeelds: So many greene leaues growes not in the woods, Nor swimme so many fish in the salt floods. So many Starres in heauen you cannot see, As here be pretty wenches, Rome, in thee. Faire Venus in the Citie of her sonne, Is honoured with Ãneas first begun, If in young Lasses thou delight, behold, More Virgins thou maist see then can be told: If women of endifferent age will ease thee, Amongst a thousand thou maist chose to please thoe If ancient women, in the Citie bee Matrons admired for their grauitie: To find a Matron Widdow or young Maide, Walke but at such time under Pompies shade. When as the Sunne mounts on the Lions backe, And store of all degrees thou shalt not lacke: Or to that marble walke which was begun, And ended by a Mother and her Sonne. Abroad, at noone, betimes or euening late, That day which we to Luna consecrate, Or to the fiftie sisters Belus daughters, That all saue one made of their husbands slaughter Or that same holiday we yearely keepe, In which faire Venus doth for Adon weepe, Or in the seauenth day sacred more then all, Which the Iewes nation doe their Sabboth call: Or to the Miemphien Church, where many a vow, Is made to the Egyptian Isis and her cow: Or to the market place, which way is short, Women of all estates do there resort, Repaire else to the pulpets, euen the same In which our learned Orators declaime, Here often is the pleaders tongue stroke dumbe By those attractiue eyes that thither come. There he to whom anothers cause is knowne, Speaking of that, wants words to pleade his owne. Venus reioycing smiles to see from farre, The Lawier made a client at the barre: But most of all I would haue thee stir, At the play time unto the Theater, Where thou shalt finde them thicke in a great nomber The matted seates, and the degrees to comber, Amongst that goodly dew thou maist behold, Whom thou both lou'st, suest to, &amp; faine would hold Looke as the laden Ants march to and fro, And with heir heauie burdens trooping go: Or as the Bee from flower to flower doth flie, Bearing each one her hony in her thigh: And round about the spatious fields do stray, So do the fairest women to a play, That I haue wondred how it could include, Of beauties such a gallant multitude. There many a Captiue looke hath conquered beene Thither ole armed to see and to be seene. Great Romulus thou first these playes contriues, To get thy widdowed souldiers Sabines wiues, In those dayes from the marble house did waue, No saile, no silken flag, no ensigne braue: The tragicke stage in that age was not red, There were no mixed coulours tempered: Then did the sceane want Art, the vnready stage. Was made of grasse and earth in that rude age. Round about which the boughs were thickly placed, The people did not think themselues disgraced: Of tuffe and heathie Sods to haue their seats, Made in degree of sods and massie peates. Thus plac'd in order, euery Roman bride, Into his Virgins eyes, and by her side. Sate him downe close, and seuerally did moue, The innocent Sabine women to their loue. And whilst the Piper Theuscus rudely playde, And by her stamping with his foot had made, A signe unto the rest, there was a shout, Whose shrill report pierst all the ayre about. Now with a signe of rape giuen from the king, Round through the house the lustie Romans fling: Leauing no corner of the same unsought, Till euery one a frighted Virgin caught: Looke as the trembling Doue the Eagle flies, Or a young Lambe when he a Wolfe espies: So run these poore girles, filling the ayre with shriek, Emptying of all the coulour in their pale cheeks, One feare possest them all but not one looke This tears her haire, she hath her wits forsooke. Some sadly sit, some on their mothers call, Some chafe, some flye, some stage but frighted all. Thus were the rauisht Sabines blushing led, Becoming shame unto each Romans bed: If any striu'd against it, strait her man, Would take her on his knee, whom feare made wan, And say why weepest thou, sweet what ailst my dear Dry up those drops, these clouds of sorrow cleare Ile be to thee, if thou thy griefe wilt smother, Such as thy father was vnto thy mother. Full well would Romulus his souldiers please, To giue them such faire Mistresses as these. If such rich wages thou wilt giue to me. Great Romulus thy souldier I will be, From that first age the Theater hath bin. Euen like a trap to take faire wenches in: Frequent he Tilt yard, for there oft times are, Clusters of people thronging at the barre. Thou shalt not need, there with thy fingers becken, Of wincking signes, or close nods do not recken; But where thy Mistris sits, do thou abide Who shall forbid thee to attaine her side, As neare as the place suffers see thou get, That none betwixt thee and her selfe be set: If thou beest mute and bashfull I will teach, How to begin and breake the ice of speech: Aske whose that horse was, what he was did guide him Whence came he, if he well or ill did ride him. Which in the course of barriers best did do, And whom she likes, him do thou fauour to. When thou espiest where Romes best gallants sit: Applaud faire Venus with thy Mistris hand it: If dust by chance upon her garments fall, Looke with thy ready hand thou brush it all. And though none fall, yet looke that without scoffe Thou with thy dutious hand beat that none off. And let the least occasion shew thy duty, None can be too seruile vnto beautie: If her loose garments hang downe that the skirt, Lick ud the dust or fall into the dirt: Officious be to lift it vp againe, And from the slutish earth to beare her traine Happly thy dutious guardian such may be, That thou her foot or well shapt leg may see. Beware that none behind her rudely crush her, Or with his bard knees or his elbowes brush her: Small fauours womens light thoughts captiuate, And many in their loues make fortunate. Beating the dust, or fanning the fresh aire, Or to her wearie foote but adde a staire. Such diligence and dutie often proues, Great furtherance to many in their loues. Within these lifts hath Cupid battaile sounded: And he that makes men wounds, himselfe bin wounded: As carelesse of himselfe he pries about, To know which c?querors of the Champions stout He feeles himselfe pierst with a flying dart, And wounded sore, complaines him of his heart. Oh what assemblie did there come to see. Great CÃ¦sar stand in all his royalltie. Praysing his prizes in their shouts and skips, Tooke in the Persian and Athenian ships, From both sides of the Seas young Gallants came, And Virgins of all sorts tÃ² see the same: Then was the Cittie throng'd, who could not find In that faire crew a Saint to please his minde. Oh gods! how many did kind fancie driue, Strangers to vs, vs vnto them do wiue. Behold Great CÃ¦sar through the whole world famed Will adde unto the nations he hath tamed. The Easterne kingdomes here to ouerpast, And they of all his Conquest shall be last. See where a stout reuenger comes in armes, Whose haughty brest the flower of honour warmes That being but a child leades warre in chaines, But more then children can by warre constraines, Thy birth day shall by generall accord, With all the newest vertues be ador'd, Thy wisedome which might well become the aged, Shall in the selfe same ranke he equipaged: That all the world may wonder one so young, Hath such a ripe wit, and so queint a tongue. Thy gifts out-strip thy age, whose slow pace lingers, Such was his instant strength, who twixt his fingers Crusht two inuenom'd Snakes being in the cradle, What would he doe being mounted on the saddle, As great as Bacchus when his yeares yet greene, Was in his power amongst the Indies seene: Is CÃ¦sar heire vnto his fathers spirit, That his forefathers vertues do inherit, With their auspicious fortune proudly dight. Wars, and shall vanquish still where he doth fight: Such be the fates, decree must be his fame That shall wage battell vnder CÃ¦sars name. Liue still thou, youth, of whom thou now art king. With milkewhite heads and beards thy praises sing, Reuenge thy wronged brothers, thy dead father, And to the wars millions of people gather. Thy father, and thy countries father too. Case thee in armes against thy insulting foe. Thou bear'st religious armes so doth not he, Wrong leades him forth, but iustice fightes for thee: Behold the Parthians are already slaine. The East yeelds homage to the Latine traine. CÃ¦sar and Mars, both gods, his fathers both Bee powerfull in his iourney now he goeth, I prophesie his conquest and his praise, In a rich stile vnto the heauens Ile raise: With my field words he shall his armie cheare, Which with their sweet sound shal inchant each eare Whilst I the Parthians flight describe at large, Who backward shoote, as flying, their foes charge. And of the Romans resolution write, In vaine poore Parthian souldiers thou dost fight, Mars the great god of armes, forsake thy droome, In vaine thou hop'st by flight to ouercome: In what day shalt thou fairest of all things, Bedeck with gold, attended on by Kings. And drawne along by foure white snowie Steeds. To royalize thy acts and famous deeds. The whilest thy troopes of souldiers round inuirons, The Captaine of the enemy bound with irons: Giuing their legs to keepe them from the flight, Which they before did practise in their fight. The ioyfull young men mingled with sweet lasses, Will croud and presse to see him as he passes, And now being meet, no sweete occasion balke, Make speech of any thing to enter talke: Though ignorant in all things, all things know, And take vpon thee to explaine each show. As thus she Euphrates that first proceeds, Hauing her head bound with a reath of reeds Call the next Tigris with her haire all blew, Maides may be flattered, to think fained things true, Say this presents Armenia, Denae she, In the next place let Achemonia be. That man's a conqueror, captiues they that tremble Speake truly, if thou canst, if not dissemble. Thence if you go to banckquet and sit downe, To tast sweet Viands and to drinke a round, There may thy thoughts vnto my art incline, Obseruing loue more then the crimson wine, Cupid himselfe alwayes inured to rapes, Hath with his own whit had rest Bacchus grapes Vntill his wings with sprinkeled wine made wet, He heauie sits and sleepes where he is set. The dew from off his feathers soone he shakes, Which from his drowned wings the dry aire takes, But from his breast so soone he cannot driue, Loue sprinkled there, though nere so much he striue Wine doth prepare the spirits, heates the braine hot, Expels deepe cares, make sorrowes quite forgot: Moues mirth, breeds laughter, makes the poor man proud And not remembring need to laugh aloud: Sets ope the thoughts, doth rudenes banish, Refineth arts, and at wine fight woes vanish. In wine hath many a young mans heart bin tooke And borne away in a faire wenches looke, In wine is lust and sancknes of desire, Ioyne wine and loue, and you adde fire to fire: Choose not a face by torch-light, but by day, Onely grosse faults such splendors can bewray. Trust no made lights, they will deceiue thine eye, Thou canst not iudge by torch-light, nor in twie. At the broad noone tide, when the Sun shin'd rarest, Did Paris say to Hellen thou art fairest. The night hides faults, the midnight houre is blind, And no mishapt deformity can find. Stones and dyed Scarlet by the day we chuse: The broad day and bright sunne in beauty vse: Sometimes vnto those places taske thy feet, Where the faire forrest hantresses do meete. In number more then sea sands, else prepare, To the warme bathes, where many a female are: There some or other hurt by Cupids stroke, Where troubled waters with warme brimstone smoke Mistakes the wounds, cause and exclaming raues, Not blaming Loue, But those vnholsome waues. See where Dianaes grouie Temple stands, Where kingdoms haue bin won by slaughtringhands Because she Cupid loathes and liues chast still. Much people he hath slaine and much shall kill: Thus farre my Muse hath sung in diuers straines: Where thou maist find fit place to set thy traines, My next indeauour is to lay the ground, To atchieue and win the Mistris thou hast found. Be prompt and apt, you that shall read my lines, And vse attention to their disciplines, The first strickt precept I enioyne your sence, Needfull to be obseru'd is conscience: Be confident, thy sute being once begun, And build on this they all are to be wonne. First shall the birds that wellcome in the spring, All mute and dombe for euer cease to sing: The sommer Ants leaue their industrious paines, And from their full mouthes cast their loaded gaines The swift Menatian hounds that chasing are Shall frighted runne backe from the trembling hare Before a wanton wench once tempted by thee Poore foole, shall haue the hard heart to deny thee, Stolne pleasure which to men is neuer hatefull, To women, is now and at all times ever gratefull: The difference is a Maide her loue will couer, Men are more impudent and publicke louers: Tis meet we men should aske the question still. Should women do it, it would become them ill. The Heifers strength being once ripe and mellow, After the Bull she through the field will bellow. The Mare neighes after the couragious Steed, But humane lust doth not so much exceed. Our flame hath lawfull bonds, keep time &amp; season, Nor bestiall made like theirs, but mixt with reason, Shold I of Biblis speake whose hot desire Doth to the brothers lawlesse bed aspire: And when the incestuous deed she well suspendeth, With resolution her sweet life she endeth: Mirrha the loue of her owne father sought, Affecting him but not as daughters ought: Her body in a tree rough rinde appeares, And with her sweete and odorifrous teares, Our bodies we perfume, these are the same, Mirrh of their mistris Mirrha that beares the name: In Ida of tall tree and Cedars full, There fed the glory of the heard, a Bull, Snow white, saue twixt his hornes one spot there grew, Saue that one staine he was of milkie hew, This Bullocke did the Heifers of the groues, Desire to beare as Prince of all their droues, But most Pasiphae with adulterous breath, Enuies the louely Heifers to the death: I speak knowne truth this cannot Creet deny, With all her hundred Cities built on hie. Tis said that for this Bull the doating Lasse, Did vse to top fresh boughes and mow young grasse Nor was the amorous Cretan Queene afeard, To grow a kinde companion to the heard: Thus through the Campaigne she is madly borne. And a wild Bull to Minos giues the horne. Tis not for brauery he doth loue or loath thee, Then why, Pasiphae, dost thou so richly cloth thee. Why dost thou thus thy face and lookes prepare, What makst thou with thy glasse ordring thy haire. Vnlesse thy glasse could make thee seeme a Cow, And how can hornes grow on that tender brow? If Minos please thee, no adulterer seeke thee, Or if thy husband Minos do not like thee: But thy lasciuious thoughts are still increast, Deceiue him with a man, not with a beast. Thus by the Queene the wilde woods are frequented, And leauing the Kings bed she is contented: To use the groues borne by the rage of mind, Euen as a ship with a full Easterne wind. How often hath she with an enuious eye, Look'd on the Cow that by her bull did lie: Saying, oh wherefore did this Heifer moue, My hearts chief Lord, and vrge him to her loue. Behold, how she before him ioyfull skips, And proudly ietting on the greene grasse lips: To please his amourous eye, th? charg'd the Queen See in these fields that cow no more beseene. No sooner to her seruants had she spoke, But the poore beast was straight put to the yoake. Some of these strumpet Heifers the Queene slew, And their warme bloud the alters did imbrew: Whilst by the sacrificing Priest she stands, And gripe their trembling entrailes in her hands, Oft praid she to the Gods but all in vaine, To appease their dieties with bloud of beasts thus slaine, And to their bowels speake, go, go, begone, To please him whom I fondly dote upon. Now doth she wish her selfe Europa then, To be faire, so pasturing in the fenne, Io a beast in shape, hide, hoofe, and horne, Onely Europa on a beast was borne. At length the Captaine of the heard beguilde, With a Cowes skin with curious art compilde. The longing Queene obtaind her full desire, And in the childes birth did bewray the fire: Had Cressa kept her from Thiestes bed, She had not with her childe beene banished. Nor PhÅbus stopt his Carr that so bright burned, And his Steeds back vnto the morning turned. King Misus daughter that was held so faire, Stole from her fathers head the purple haire: And hanging at the ship in her fall. Chang'd to a bird in voice, in shape and all. Another Silla was by Circes spels Made a Sea monster, and in the ocean dwels: Beneath whose nauell barketh many a hound. Whose rauenous gulfe like throats ship, and men drownd. The wisest of great Alcides that by land, Fled the great god of war and did withstand: Neptune by Sea, behold alas she dies. A wofull and lamented sacrifice: Whose sorrows only not bright Crusaes flame, Wishing their salt teares might haue quencht the same Who could but weepe to see young children slaine, Whilst their warme blouds their mothers garments staine, Phanux Annutors daughter she laments, The swift pact hurrying chariot teares and rents. Chiefe mischiefe all by womens lusts engender, Some of their hearts be tough, though most be tender Womens desires are burning, some contagious, Mens are more temporate, farre &amp; lesse outragious: Then in my art proceed nor doubt to enioy. And win all women be they nere so coy. Vse them by my directions, being learned by thee, Not one amongst a thousand will deny thee: Yet loue they to be vrg'd by some constraint, As well in things which they deny as grant: But take thou no repulse, ist not a treasure, To enioy new delights and tast fresh pleasure. Varietie of sweets are welcome still, And acccptablest to a womans will: They thinke that corne best in anothers field, Their neighbors go ate the sweetest milk doth yeeld. But first ere siege be to thy Mistris laid, Practise to come acquainted with her maid: She can prepare the way, seeke thy redresse, And by her meanes thou maist haue sweet accesse To her familar care your counsels show, And all your priuate pleasures let her know: Bribe her with gifts, corrupt her with reward With her that's easie which to thee seemes hard, She can chose times, so times Physitions keepe, When in thy Mistris armes thou safe maist sleepe, And that must be when she is apt to yeeld, What time the ripe corne swells within the field, When banisht sorrowes, from her heart remoue, And giues mirth place, she lies broad wake to loue. Whilest Troy was pensiue, twas well fenc'd and kept, But then betraid when they securely slept: Yet sometimes proue her, when thou find'st her sad, Mourning her owne wrong with some vsage bad. Follow that humor with thy fluent tongue, Shee'l grace thee to reuenge her former wrong. Her may the industrious maide betimes prepare, And softly whisper, yet that she may heare, Such wrongs no woman that hath sprit can beare: So shee proceeds to thee, lifts thy praises hie, Sweare for her chaste Loue thou art bent to dye, And there step in, and doubt not to preuaile. Yet ere her furious anger hath strooke saile, Rage in that Sea: delay consumes and dyes, Like ice against the sunne; no grace despise That from the hand-maid comes; with all thy power Seeke by conuenient meanes her to deflower. She is industrious and made apt for sport, And by her office limits your resort, She, if her owne counsel may be closly kept, Her Ladies due would gladly intercept. All is hap hazard, though it be with paine, My counsell is from these things to abstaine. I will not headlong ouer mountaines tread, Nor following me shall any be misled: But of the maide by whom thou send'st thy letter, With her care please thee well, with her face better Begin not therefore with the Maide to toy. Thy Mistris loue and fauour first enioy. One thing beware, if thou wilt credit Art, Nor let my words amongst the windes depart: If thou hast mou'd her once take no deny all, Resolue to act, or neuer to make tryall, From feare and blame thou art secure and free, As soone as she partakes the crime with thee. You see the bird that to the morning sings, Cannot soare high, when she hath lim'd her wings: Nor can the sauage Boare with brisled backe, Breake through those toyles, which he before made slack; The fish that glides along the siluer brook, Is quickly drawne, being wounded with the hooke, So hauing once but tride her, make her yeeld, And neuer part but conquer from the field: The fault being mutuall, knowing how she fell The bashfull girle will be asham'd to tell, But shee can shew thee in familiar phrase, Both what thy vertuous Mistris doth and sayes. Alwayes be secret if your gilt appeare, Twill in thy Lady breed perpetuall feare. He is deceiu'd that thinkes all times auaile For Swaines to turne the earth, Seamen to sayle: All seasons are not kinde when men should sow, Times must be pickt, to haue your graine well grow. Nor alwayes is the surging ocean fit, That the well fraughted ship may saile in it: Nor is it alwayes time faire girles to woe, Sometimes abstaine, so doth thy Master doe. Omit her birth-day, and those Calends misse, When Mars and Venus both abstaine to kisse: At some forbidden seasons being deckt, With princely tire, vse her with great respect: In the breame winter when that Phades raine. From the sweet worke of Venus most abstaine: Forbeare the like resort amongst thy wenches, When that the tender kidd the ocean drenches. Thou shalt begin euen in that very day, When wofull and lamenting Alila. Lookes on the tragicke earth made crimson red, With the wild Romans wounds which that day bled, Or in the seuenth feast which is held diuine, And honoured by the men of Palestine. Thy Ladyes birth day Ceremonies make, And superstitiously all workes forsake, Aboue all dayes let that a blacke day be, When thou giuest ought, or she doth beg of thee You shall haue some into your bosomes creepe, Who iestingly will snatch things they will keepe. And by some slight and pretty wanton suite, To enrich themselues will leaue thee destitute, First shall the linnen draper bring his wares, And lay his pack wide open, at the Faires. She will peruse them as thou standst her nigh, The whilst the Draper askes what will you buy? Strait will she craue thy iudgement in the Lawne, Thou by degrees to shew thy skill art drawne: Then will she kisse thee, pray thee she may try it, Thus by her flattery thou art wonne to buy it. Canst thou deny the wanton she will sweare, This gift shall serue her use for many a yeare: It is now cheape she hath great need of this, And euery word she mingles with a kisse. Hast thou no coyne about thee thou shalt send, To intreat it by a letter from thy frend. What must I needs present her with this casket, Because that on her birth day she doth ask it? Then euery day she wants she will be sworne, That at that very day she's bred and borne, Or when I see her how she sadly weeps, And faining some false losse much seeking keepes, As if she had let fall some pretious thing, A iewell from her eare, her hand a ring. What's that to me, or if I here her pray, To borrow this or that vntill some day. What's lent is lost, and to be found no more. Women things borrowed neuer will restore. Ten tongues, as many mouthes cannot impart, Halfe the sleights vsed in the strumpets art, Make loue with letters and thy money saue, Dato dona sicut dat mella genista. And let them wax, and inke, and paper haue, Keepe what thou hast, for words good words surrender. For flattery, like falshood euer tender. Faire words are cheape, what more thou giu'st is lost, Flatter, speake faire, 'tis done with little cost. Old Priam by intreaty Hector wonne, Which bribed Achilles neuer would haue done: Force is but weake, intreaty hath her odds. So we intreate but not inforce the gods. A promise is a charme to make fooles fat, Be full of them, promise no matter what. A promise is a meere inchanting witch, By promises 'tis an easie matter to be rich. The hope of gaine will keepe thy credit free, Hope is a goddesse false yet true to thee Giue her and say, you part on some disdaine, Thou by her looseth, she by thee shall gaine: Be allwaies giuing, but your gift still keepe, And thy delayes in wordes well harmed steepe. So hath the barren field deceiu'd the swaine, So doth the Gamster loose in hope to gaine: Loue that on euen hands growes is most pure, That which comes gratis longest doth endure. Write first, and let thy pleasant lines salute her. A letter breakes the ice of any suiter: A letter in an apple writ and sent, Wonne faire Cidippe to her louers bent. You Roman Youthes all other toyes resigne: Leaue the seuen liberall Arts and Muses nine: As when you heare an Orator declaime, The people iudge and Senat grace the same. So when the faire maids thou shalt come among, Speake well, and they will all applaud thy tongue, But speake not by the booke, it breeds offence, To count in strange and fustian eloquence: None but a gull such Bastard words will praise, Or in his speech vse an inforced phrase. Who but a mad man else with Orations, Plead to his loue and woe in declamations Vse a smooth language, and accustomed speech, And with no straining discourse loue beseech, As if thou camst to speak a studied part, But as immediately sent from the heart. If she receiue thy lines, and scornes to read them, But casting them away, on the ground tread them: Despaire not though, but that she may in time, And will with iudging eyes peruse thy rime, In time the stubborne Heifers draw the waine, In time the wildest steeds do brooke the raine: Time frets hard iron, in time the plowshares worne Let the ground soft by which the steele is torne. What's harder then a stone, or what more soft Then water is, and yet by droping oft The gentle raine will eat into the flints, And in their hard sides leaues impressiue dints. Do but persist the suite thou hast begone: In time will chaste Penelope be wonne: Long was it ere the Cittie Troy was taine: Yet was it burnt at length and Priam slaine. Hath she peruse the scroule thou didst indite, And will she not as yet an answer write: Enforce her not, it is enough to thee, That she hath read it, and thy loue doth see. Feare not, if once she read what thou hast write, She will vouchsafe in time to answer it. At first perhaps her letter will be sowr, And on thy hopes her paper seeme to lowr: In which she will coniure thee to be mute, And charge thee to forbeare thy hated suite Tush, what she most forwarnes she most desires, In frosty woods are hid the hottest fires. Onely pursue to reape what thou hast sowne, A million to a mite she is thy owne. If thou by chance hast found her in some place, Downe on her back and vpwards with her face. Occasion smiles upon thee, thanke thy fate, Steale to her besides with a theeuish gate: And hauing wonne, vnto her wisely beare thee, With watchfull care that no Eausedropper heare thee. When thou meetest best abroad. Or if she walke abroad without delay, Be thou a quicke spie to obserue her way. Keepe in her eye, and crosse her in the street, Here ouertake her, at that corner meet; Then come behinde her, then out strip her pace, And now before her, and now after trace. Now fast, now slow, and euer moue some stay, That she may finde thee still first in her way, Not be affraid if thou occasion spie. To iog her elbow as thou passest by. When thou findest her in the Theater.Or if thou happenest to behold from farr, Thy Mistris crossing to the Theater: Hye to the place, being there look round about thee And in no seate let her befound without thee No matter though the play thou do not minde. Thou sights enough within her face shalt find: There stand at gaze, there wonder, there admire, There speaking lookes may whisper thy desire, Applaud him whom she likes, if thou discouer, In any straine a true well acted louer. Make him thy instance, court her by all skill, If she rise, rise, if she sit, sit thee still: Laugh thou but wh? she smiles, die when she lowers And in her lookes and gestures loose thy howers. Thy legs with eating pumice do not weare, Vse not hot irons to crispe and curle thy haire, No spruce starch fashions should on louers waite, Men best become a meere neglectted gate. Blunt Theseus came with no perfumes to Creete And yet great Minos daughter thought him sweete PhÅdra did loue Hippollitus, yet he, Had on his back no Courtly brauery. Adonis like a woodman still was clad, Yet Venus doated on the louely lad: Go neate and handsome, comelines best pleases And the desire of women, soonest ceases. Vse a meete gate, thy garments without staine, Keepe not thy face from weather nor from raine, Thy tong haue without roughnes, thy teeth cleare And white, and let no rust inhabite there, Weare thy shoes close and fit and not to wide, Cut thy haire compasse, euen on either side: Let no disordered haires here and there stand, But haue thy beard trim'd with a skilfull hand. Make blant thy nailes, pare them &amp; keep them low Let no stiffe haires within thy nostrils grow: Keepe thy breath sweet and fresh, lest ranke it smell Such is the aire where bearded goates do dwell. All other loose tricks and effeminate toyes: Leaue thou to wanton girles and iugling boyes: Behold young Bacchus me his Poet names, He fauor louers and those amourous flames, In which he hath bene scorcht; it so fell out, Mad Ariadne straid the Ile about: The tale of Theseus and Ariadne. Being left alone within that desert plaine, Where the brooke Dia pores into the maine. Who making from her rest her vaile vnbound, Her bare foot treading on the tender ground, Her golden haire disolued, aloud she raues, Calling on Theseus to the defused waues. On Theseus, cruell Theseus, whom she seeks, Whilst showers of teares makes furrowes in her cheeks She calls and weeps, &amp; weeps and calls at once, Which might to ruth moue the senceles stones. Yet both alike became her, they grac'd her, The whilst she striues to call him, or cry faster. Then beates she her soft breast, and makes it grone And then she cries what is false Theseus gone? What shall I do? she cries, what shall I do? And with that note she runs the Forrest through When suddenly her eares might vnderstand, Cimballs and I in brels toucht with a loud hand, To which the forrest woods and caues resound: And now amaz'd she senceles falls to ground. Behold the Nymphes come with their scattered hair Falling behinde, which they like garments weare, And the light Satires, and vntoward crew, Nearer and nearer to the Virgin drew. Then old Silenus on his lazie asse. Nods with his drunken pare about to passe. Where the poore Ladie, all in teares lies drown'd, Scarce sits the drunkard, but he falls to ground, Scarce holds the bridle fast, but staggering stoopes, Following those giddy Bacchanlian troopes. Who dance the wild Laualto on the grasse Whilst with a staffe he layes upon his asse. At length when the young Satyrs least suspect, He tumbling falls quite from his asses necke: But vp they heaue him, whilst each Satyre cries, Rise good old father, good old Father rise, Now comes the god himselfe, next after him, His vine like Chariot driuen with Tygres grimme: Colour and voice, and Theseus she doth lack: There would she fly, and their feare puld her back: She trembles like a stalke the winde doth shake Or a weake reed that growes besides the lake. To whom the Gods spake, Lady take good cheare, See one more faithfull then false Theseus here. Thou shalt be wife to Bacchus for a gift, Receiue high heauen, and to the spheares be lift, Where thou shalt shine a starre to guide by night, The wandring Seaman in his course aright: This said, least that his Tigres should astray, The trembing maide, the God his coach doth stay. And leaping from his Chariot with his heeles, He prints the sand, with that the Nymph he feeles: And hugging her, in uaine she doth resist. He beares her thence, Gods can do what they list. Some Hymen sing, and Io cry, So Bacchus with the maide that night doth lye: Therefore when wine in plenteous cups do flow, And thou that night vnto thy loue doth owe: Pray to the god of grapes that in thy bed, The quaffing healths do not offend thy head. In wine much hidden talke thou maist inuent: Loue tricks vsed in eating and drinking. To giue thy Lady note of thy intent. To tell her thou art hers and she is thine, Thus euen at board make loue tricks in the wine. Nay, I can teach thee though thy tongue be mute, How with thy speaking eye to moue thy suite: Good language may be made in lookes and wincks, Be first that takes the cup wherein she drinks. And note the very place her lip did such Drinke iust at that, let thy regard be such. Or when she carues, what part of all the meate, She with her finger tuch that cut and eate: Or if thou carue to her or, she to thee, Her hand in taking it touch cunningly. Be with her friend familiar, and be sure, It much auailes to make thy loue endure: When thou drink'st, drink to him aboue the rest, Grace him, and make thy selfe a thankfull guest. In euery thing preferre him to his face. Though in his function he be nere so base. The course is safe and doth securenesse lend, For who suspectlesse may not greet his friend. Yet though the path thou tread'st seem straight and plaine, In some things it is full of rubs againe. Drinke sparingly, for my impose is such, And in your singling him take not too much: Carrouse not to much.Carrouse not but with soft and moderate sups, Haue a regard and measure in your cups. Let both the feete and thoughts their office know, Chiefly beware of brawling which may grow By too much wine, from fighting most abstaine. In such a quarrell was Eurition slaine: Where swaggering leades the way mischiefe comes after, Iankets and wine were made for mirth &amp; laughter, Sing.Sing if thy voice be delicate and sweet, Dance.If thou canst dance then nimbly shake thy feet. If thou hast in thee ought that's more then comm?, Shew it; such gifts as these most please a woman. Though to be drunk indeed may hurt the braine, Yet now and then I hold it good to faine. Instruct thy lisping tongue sometimes to trip, That if a word misplac'd do passe thy lip: At which the carping presence find some clause, It may be iudg'd that quaffing was the cause. Then boldly say, how happy were that man, That could enfould thee in his armes and then Wish to embrace her in her sweet hearts stead, Whom in her eare thou rauest to see dead. But when the tables drawne and she among: The full crew rising thrust into the throng. And tuch her softly as she forth doth goe, And with thy foot tread gently on her toe. Now is the time to speake, be not afraid, Him that is bold both loue and fortune aid. Doubt not thy want of Rhetorick true loue show, Good words vnwares vpon thy tongue will flow, Make as thy tong could wound thy soul with griefe And vse what art thou canst to win reliefe. All women of themselues selfe-loued are, The foulest in their owne conceits are faire: Praise them, they will beleeue thee I haue knowne, A meere dissembler a true louer growne. Prouing in earnest what he faind in sport, Then, oh you Maides, vse men in gentle sort: Be affable, and kinde, and scorne eschew, Loue forg'd at first may at the last proue true. Let faire wordes worke into their hearts as brooks, Into a hollow band that ouer looks: The margent of the water praise her cheeke: The coulour of her haire commend and like. Her slender finger and her pretty foot, Her body and each part that longs vnto't: And women as you hope my stile shall raise you, I charge you to beleeue men when they praise you, For praises please the chastest maids delight. To heare their Louers in their praise to write, Iuno and Pallas hate the Phrigian soyle: Where Paris to their beauties gaue the foile. Euen yet they enuy Venus and still dare her, To come to a new iudgement which is fairer. The Peacock being praised spreads his traine, Besilent and he hides his wealth againe. Horses trapt richly praise them in their race, They will curuet and proudly mend their pace. Large promises in loue I much alow, Nay call the gods as witnesse to thy vow: For Ioue himselfe sits in the azure skies, And laughes below at louers periuries. Commanding Eolus to disperse them quite, Euen Ioue himselfe hath falsly sworne some write. By Stix to Iuno, and since then doth show, Fauours to us that falsly sweare below. Gods surely be gods, we must thinke they are, To them burne incense and due rights prepare: Nor do they sleepe as many thinke they do, Lead harmelesse liues, pay debts and forfeits to, Keepe couenant with thy friend and banish fraud, Kill not, and such a man the gods applaud. Say women none deceiue, the gods haue spoken, There is no paine impos'd on faith so broken. Fa[illeg.]ere fal[illeg.]a a[illeg.]tem non [illeg.] fraus.Deceiue the sly deceiuer they finde snares, To catch poore harmelesse louers vnawares. Lay the like traines for them; nine yeare some faine In Egypt there did fall no drop of raine, Susiris kild Horatius because he saw as a stranger.When Thratius to the grimme Busiris goes, And from the Oracle this answer showes: That Ioue must be appeas'd with strangers blood, They said Busiris kild him where he stood: And said withall thou stranger first art slaine, To appease the Gods and bring great Egypt raine Phallaris bull, King Phallaris first said; With the worke master that the Engine made: Both Kings were iust, death deaths inuenter try, And iustly in their owne inuentions die, So should false oathes, by right false oathes beguile And a deceitfull girle be caught by wile: Keepe to her,Then teach thy eyes to weepe, tears perswade truth And moues obdurat Adamant to ruth. At such speciall times that passing by, She may perceiue a teare stand in thy eye. Or if tears faile, as still thou canst not get them, Kisse her.With thy moist finger rub thy eyes and wet them Who but a foole that canot iudge of blisses, But when he speakes will with his word mixe kisses, Say she be coy and will giue none at all, Take them vngiuen, perhaps at first shee'l brawle. [illeg.]triue and resist her all the wayes she can, And say withall away you naughtie man. Yet will she fight like one would loose the field, And striuing gladly be constraind to yeeld: Be not so boisterous, do not speake to hie: Lest by rude hurting of her lips she cry. He that gets kisses with his pleading tongue, And gets not all things that to loue belong; I count him for a Meacocke and a sot. Worthy to loose the kisses that he got, What more then kissing wanted of the game, Was thy meere dastardie, not bashfull shame: They terme it force, such force comes welcome still, What pleaseth them they grant against their will. PhÅbe the faire was forc'd so was her sister, Yet PhÅbe in her heart thank'd him that kist her: There is a tale well knowne how Hecubs sonne, To steale faire Hellen through the streame did run, Venus who by his censure wonne in Ide, Gaue to him in requitall this faire bride: Now for another world doth saile with ioy, A welcome daughter to the king of Troy The whilest the Grecians are already come, Mou'd with this publick wrong against Ilium: Achilles in a smok his Sex doth smother, And layes the blame upon his carefull mother. What makes thou great Achilles tozing wooll, When Pallas in a caske should hide thy skull? What doth that palme with wobs and thrids of gold Which are more fit a warlike shield to hold? Why should that right hard rocke and twig contain By which the Troyan Hector must be slaine, Cast off these loose vailes and thy armour take. And in thy hand the speare of Pelias shake. Thus Lady like he with a Lady lay, Till what he was her belly did bewray: Yet was she forc'd; so oft we to beleeue, Not to be so inforst how would she grieue. When he should rise from her still would she cry, For he had arm'd him and his Rocke laid by, [illeg.]e secrett in loue.And with a soft voice spake Achille stay, It is to soone to rise, lie downe I pray: And then the man that forc'd her she would kisse, What force Deidemeia call you this. There is a kinde of feare in the first proffer, But hauing once begun she takes the offer, Trust not to much young man to thy faire face, Nor looke a woman should entreat thy grace, First let a man with sweet words smooth his way, Be forward in her eare to sue and pray If thou wilt reape fruites of thy loues effects, Onely begin 'tis all that she expects, So in the ancient times Olimpian Ioue, Made to Heroes suite and wonne their loue: But if thy words breed scorne, a while forbeare, For many what most flies them hold most deare: And what they may haue profer'd fly and shunne, By soft retreate great vantage may be wonne. In person of a woer come not still, But sometimes as a friend in meere good will: Thou camst her friend, but shalt returne her Loue, A white soft hew my iudgement doth disproue. Giue me a face whose coulour knowes no art, Which the greene sea hath tan'd the Sunne made swart: Beauty not approued in [illeg.] man.Beauty is meere vncomely in a Clowne, That vnder the hot Planets plough the ground. And thou that Pallas Garland wouldst redeeme, To haue a white face it would ill be seene. Let him that loues looke pale, for I protest, That coulour in a Louer still shewes best, Looke pale. Orion wandring in the woods lookt sickly, Daphne being once in loue lost colour quickly Thy leannesse argues loue, seeme sparely fed Leane. And sometimes weare a nightcap on thy head, For griefs and cares that in afflictions show, Sickly. Weaken a Louers spirits and bring him low. Looke miserably poore, it much behoues, That all that see you, may say, yon man loues, Shall I proceed or stay, moue or disswade? Friendship and faith of no account are made. Loue mingles right with wrong, friendship despises And the world faith holds vaine, and slightly prises. Thy Ladies beauty do not thou commend, Suspect thy friend in loue. To thy companion or thy trusty friend: Least of thy praise enamoured it may breed, Like loue in them with passions that exceed, Yet was the nuptiall bed of great Achilles Vnstain'd by his deare friend Actorides: The wife of Theseus though she went stray, Was chast as much as in Pithirous lay. PhÅbu and Pallas, Hermonius, Phillades, And the two twins we call Tentarides: Tend to the like, but he that in these daies, For the like trust acquires the selfe same praise. He may aswell from weedes seeke sweete rose buds, Apples of thornetrees, home from the flouds. Nothing is practis'd now, but what is ill, Pleasure is each mans God, faith they excell: And that stolne pleasure is respected chiefe, Which falls to one man by anothers grief: O mischiefe you young louers, feare not those, That are your open and professed foes, Suspect thy friend, though else in all things iust. Yet in thy loue he will deceiue thy trust, Friends breed true feares in loue the presence hate, Of thy neare kinsman, brother and sworne mate. I was about to end, but loe I see, Quot capita tot sensus.How many humourous thoughts in women be, But thou that in my Art thy name wilt raise, A thousand humors woe a thousand wayes: One plot of ground all simples cannot bring, This is for vines, here corne their oliues spring. More then be seuerall shapes beneath the skies, Haue womens gestures, thoughts, and fantasies? He that is apt will in himselfe deuise, Innumerable shapes of fit disguise, To shift and change like Proteus whom wee see. A Lion first, a bore, and then a tree. Some fishes strangely by a dart are tooke, These by a net and others by a hooke: All ages not alike intrapped are, The crooked old wife sees the traine from far. Appeare not learned vnto one that's rude, Nor loose to one with chastitie indu'd: Shoule you so do alas the pretty elues, Would in the want of Art distrust themselues, Hence comes it, their best fortunes some refuse And the base bed of an inferior chuse: Part of my toyles remaines, and part is past Here doth my shaken ship her ancker cast. FINIS. THE SECOND BOOKE. Sing Io PÅan, twice twice Io say, My toyles are pitcht, &amp; I haue caught my pray: Let the glad Louer crowne my head with bayes And before old blind Homer Ouid praise. So did king Pryams sonne exulting skip, Parit. With the faire rauish'd Hellen in his ship: Pelops. So did he sing that in his chariot runne, And Victor like the bright Allanta wonne. Whether away young man thy barke is lost, Yet in the mid-sea farre from any coast: 'Tis not enough to thee by my new art, To finde a Lady that commandes thy heart, The reach of my inuention is much deeper. By art thou her shalt win, by art shalt keepe her: As difficult it is by art to blinde her. To thy desires, as at the first to finde her. In this consists the substance of my skill, Cupid and Venus both assist me still. And gratious Erato my stile prepare, Thou art the muse that hast of Louers care, I promise wondrous things, I will explaine, How fickle thoughts in loue may firme remaine, And how the wag in fetters may be hur'ld, That strayes and wanders round about the world Yet Is loue light and hath too wings to fly: Tis hard to outstrip him mounting the skie. The tale of Dedalus &amp; his sonne Icarus.What Minos to his guest alwayes denied, A desperate passage through the aire he tried: As Dedalus the Labyrinth hath built, In which to shut the Queene Pasiphaes guilt. Kneeling he sayes, iust Minos end my mones, And let my natiue country shroud my bones. Grant me great king, what yet the fates deny, And where I haue not liued Ã´ let me die: Or if dread Soueraigne I deserue no grace. Looke with a pitious eye on my childs face. And grant him leaue, from whence we are exilde, Or pitty me, if you deny my childe. This and much more he sayes, but all in vaine: Both sonne and sire still doth the king detaine. Which he perceiuing, said, now now tis fit, To giue the world cause to admire thy wit: The Land and Sea are watcht by day and night, Nor land nor sea lies open to our flight: Onelie the ayre remaines, then let vs trie, To cut a passage through the aire and flie: Ioue be auspitious to my enterprise, I couet not to mount aboue the skies, But make this refuge since I can prepare, No meanes to flie my Lord, but through the aire: Make me immortall, bring me to the brim, Of the blacke Stigian waters, Stix Ile swim. Oh humane wit thou canst inuent much ill, Thou searchest strang arts who would think by skill, A heauie man like a light bird should stray, And through the emptie heauens find a [illeg.]t way. He placeth in iust order all his quils, Whose bottoms with resolued wax he fills? Then bindes them with a line, and being fast tide, He placeth them like oares on either fide. The little lad the downie feathers blew, And what his father wrought he nothing knew: The wax he softened, with the strings he plaid, Not thinking for his shoulders they were made: To whom his father spake, and then lookt pale, With these swift ships we to our land must saile, All passage now doth cruell Minos stop, Onely the empty aire he still leaues ope: That way must we, the land and the rough deepe, Doth Minos barre the aire, he can not keepe, But in the way beware thou set no eie, On the signe Virgo nor Boetes hie: Looke not the blacke Orion in the face, That beares a sword, but iust with me keepe place, Thy wings are now in fastning, follow me, I will before thee flie, as thou shalt see. Thy father mount or stoope, so I arreed thee, Take me thy guide and safely I will lead thee If we should soare too neare great PhÅbus seate, The melting wax will not endure the heate. Or if we fly too neare the humid seas, Our moistened wings we shall not shake with ease, Fly betweene both, and with the gusts that rise, Let thy light bodie saile amidst the skies. And euer as his little sonne he charmes, He fits the feathers to his tender armes, And shewes him how to moue his body light, As birds do teach the little young ones flight: By this he calls a counsell of his wits, And his owne wings vnto his shoulders fits. Being about to rise he fearefull quakes, And in his new way his faint body shakes: But ere he tooke his flight he kist his sonne, Whilst flouds of tears downe by his cheeks did run. There was a hillock not so high and tall, As lofty mountains be: nor yet so small: To be with vallies euen, and yet a hill, From this they both attempt their vncouth skill: The father moues his wings and with respect, His eyes upon his wandring sonne reflect. They beare a spacious course and the apt boy. Fearlesse of harmes in his new tract doth ioy. And flies more boldly now vpon them lookes, The fishermen that angle in the brookes. And with their eyes cast vpwards frighted stand, By this is Samos Isle on ther left hand: With Maxos, Paros, Delphos, and the rest, Fearelesse they take the course that likes them best Vpon the right hand Eenrithos they forsake. Now Astpelea with thy fishie lake: Shadie Pachinne full of woods and groues: When the rash boy to bold in ventring roues. Looses his guide, and takes his flight so hie. That the soft wax against the Sunne doth fry. And the cords slip that made the feathers fast, So that his armes haue power vpon no blast: He fearefully from the high clouds looks downe, Vpon the lower heauens whose curld waues frowne At his ambitious height, and from the skies, He sees black night and death before his eyes: Now melts the wax his naked arme he shake. And seeking to catch hold no hold he takes. But now the naked lad downe headlong falls, And by the way he father; father calls? Helpe father, helpe he cries, and as he speakes A violent waue his course of language breakes, The vnhappy father, but no father now, Cryes out aloud, sonne Icarus where art thou: Where art thou Icarus? where dost thou fly? Icarus where art? when straight he doth espie, The feathers swimme, thus loud he doth exclame, Vse in Charmes The earth his bones, the Sea still keepes his name. Minos could not restrane a man from flight, But winged Cupid be he nere so light. He gulls himselfe that seekes to witches craft, No Magick potions Or with a young colts forhead make a draft. No power in wise Medeus potions dwells, Nor drowned poysons mixt with magicke spels. The power of Loue is not inforc'd by these, For were it so, then had Ersonides. Beene stayd by Phasius, and Vlisse kept, Who stole from Circe, while the inchantresse slept. These charmed drugs moues madnesse: hurts the brain To gaine pure loue, pure loue returne again. Mischieuous thoughts eschew to purchase grace. Manners preuailes more then a beautious face, Vse manners. And yet the Nimphes the loue of Nilus seeke, And Homer doats on Nieureus the faire Greeke, But trust not thou the beautie to keepe kind, Thy mistris seekes the beauty of thy minde All outward beautie fades as yeares increase, Euen so it weares away and waxeth lesse, Beautie in her owne course is ouertaken, The violet now fresh is, strait forsaken. Nor allwayes do the Lilles of the field, The glorious beauties of their obiect yeeld. The fragrant rose once pluckt the briery throne, Shews rough &amp; naked, on which the rose was born Oh thou most faire, white haires come on apace, And wrinkled furrowes which will plough thy face Instruct thy soule, thy thoughts haue perfect made, These beauties last till death, all others fade. To liberall arts thy carefull howers apply, Learne many tongues with their true Euphony: Vlisses was not faire but eloquent, Yet to his Loue the Sea Nymphes did consent. How often did the Witch his stay implore, Making the Seas vnfit for sayle or oare: She praid him oft, because he spake so well, Ouer and ouer Troyes sad fate to tell. Whilst he with pithy words and fluent phrase, Receits the selfe same storie diuers wayes: Calipso as they on the Sea bonke stood, Casting their eyes vpon the neighbouring flood: Desires the fall and bloudy acts to heare, Wrought by the Ord[illeg.]ision Captaines sword &amp; spear, Then holding twixt his fingers a white wand, What she requests he drawes vpon the sand. Here's Troy quoth he, and then the walls he paints Thinke Simois this imagine these my tents: There was a place in which Dolon was slaine, About the virgill watch when with the raine. The Hemonian horses play, and as he speaker, To counterfeit that place the sand he breakes, Here Scithian Rhesus tents are picht on high, This way his horsemen slaine, returned I. More did he draw, when on the sudaine low, A climing waue the shore doth ouerflow. And as her drops amidst his workes doth fall, It washt away his tents, his Troy and all: To which the Goddesse dares Vlisses try, These sencelesse violent waues that clime so hie: And wilt thou with these waters be annoyed, By which so great names are so soone destroyed. Then trust no idle shape, it will decay, Seeke inward beauty, such as last for aye: Sweete affabillity will enter farre Be [illeg.] Into a womans breast, when scorne breeds warre. We hate the hawke and loath her flesh to eate, Because by rapine she doth get her meate. The Woolfe we hunt, and enuy all her stocke, Because the Lambe she kils, and spoiles the flocke: But none the gentle swallow layes to catch, The louing stockes within our turrets hatch, Away with quarrels, bitter words, rough deeds, Loue with kind language and faire speeches speeds Shun str[illeg.] Strife makes the married couple often iarre: The man with wife, the wife with man to warre: Leaue brauls to wiues, they are their marriage dower, And with kinde words salute thy Paramore When by appointment you shall meet in bed, By the lawes done, you are not thither led: Strict statutes from such actions still withdraw, Yet your abounding loue supplie the Law: Bring louing speeches to enchant the eare, Be louing: And mouing words such as she ioies to heare: I am not Tutor vnto him that's rich, My precepts soare not to so high a pitch. The Louer that's endow'd with gold or fee, And comes with gifts, he hath no need of me. He that at euery word can take supply, Hath in that euery word more wit then I: We yeeld to him he that their laps can fill. Teacheth an art that goes beyond my skill. My Muse instructs poore Louers wanting pelfe, For when I lou'd I was but poore my selfe. Still as my purse no store of crownes affords, I in the stead of rich gifts give fair words; Be fearfull you poore louers to displease, Be patient to endure things against your ease. Be patient.Things that the rich would scorne, it was my hap: Once as my head lay in my mistris lap: To grow inrag'd, when straight I fell to beate her, To touse her ordered locks and ill intreate her. But what ensude oh God, much griefe it cost me, Many sweet dayes, many sweet nights it lost me. Whether I toucht her cloathes, I might deny, She sayes I tore them, I some new must buy: You Schollers by your Masters harmes beware, These ills by him already proued are. Make against the Parthians warre, but to thy Loue Being concord peace, and all things that can moue: Though at the first you finde him but vntoward, Beare it, and she in time will proue lesse froward. The crooked arme that from the tree is cut. By gentle vsage is made straite, but put: Such violence is it as thy strength deliuers And thou wilt breake the short wood into shiures. By industry thou maist ore swimme a floud, Whose raging currant else is scarce withstood. By industry the Tigres gently grow: And the wild Lions may be tamed so. The sauage Bull whose fierce ire doth prouoke, By industry is brought vnto the yoake: Arcadian Atalanta was most cruelie, At length came one whom she esteem'd her Iewell. Oft wept Hippomanes at his mishap, And her seuerity who sought to intrapt Her harmlesse Louers, oft, at her fierce becke, He laid betwixt his shoulders and her necke. The toyles for sauage Beasts: and with his speare, He pierc'd such vntam'd cattell as came neare: To such hard taskes I do not thee compell To arme thy body against Monsters fell. In the wide wildernesse to seek out broyles, Nor on thy necke to beare the guilefull toyles. My imposition is not seuere: No such aduentures are inioyned here. This onely meanes all danger will disperse: Yeeld her her humour when she goes perverse: Humor her. What she in conference argues, argue thou What she approues, m[illeg.]he same words allow, Say what she saies, deny what she denies, If she laugh, laugh, if she weeps wet thine eyes. And let thy countenance be to thine a law, To keepe thy actions and thy lookes in awe: Or if thou hand to hand shalt play at dice, At tables or at chasts by some de[illeg.]e, Loose to her at game Let her depart a Conquerour else 'twere sinne, What gladly thou wouldst loose, that let her win. Let thy officious hand then beare her fan. Beare her fanne. When thou shalt chance her through the streets to man Make thy supporting arme to hers a stay, Through throngs and presses vsher her the way. As she ascends her bed set her a staire. By which to [illeg.]lme and every thing prepare: That she may see them done without offence, Reach thou her pantefles or take them thence. And standing by to watch her while she rests, Warme thy cold hands betwixt her parting breasts Nor thinke it base, 'twill please though it be base, To hold the glasse vnto thy Mistris face. He that deseru'd within those heauen to tarry: Hercules Which he before vpon his backe did carry. Performing more then Iuno could command him So wrong, that no fierce m?ster could withst?d him Euen he Al ides Ioles. Grace to win. Shapt like a woman did both card and spin. Go thou, and in his seruill place proceed, And gaine as faire a mistris for thy meed: Art thou inioyn'd at such an hower to be, In the great Forum where she waites for thee. Hasten thy weary steps and thank thy fate, Come there betimes, depart not thence till late: Bids she thee go, all businesse lay apart, Run, till with extreame heate thou melt thy heart. Sups she abroad, and wants she one to attend her, Backe to her lodging, it will not offend her: To wait her at the same place in the porch. And light her home directly with a torth: Is she in the Country, and commands thee come, Hast thou no coach vpon thy ten toes run. Let neither winter blast, nor stormes of haile, Nor the hot thirstie dogstarre let thee faile: Shun neither heate nor cold but see though, Though euery step, thou treadst knee deep in snow Loue is a kinde of war, all such depart, As beare a timerous or a sloathfull heart, Nights, winters, long waies, watching griefe in milions, Torments Loues souldiers in their foft pauilions: On cold ground thou must lie beare many a showr When the heauens open and the floudgates powre So PhÅbus when Aometus sheepe he kept, In a thatch cottage on the cold flower slept. What PhÅbus did, who may it not beseeme, Better then PhÅbus of himselfe esteeme: What mortall louer dare, then sloth despise, You that confirm'd and lasting loue deuise. If at the outward gate as watch stand centry, Or say the blots or locks deny the entry: Hazard for her. Search some strange passage, through a casement crall, Or by a cord downe from the chimney fall. Thee in her louing armes she straite will take, Reioicing thou wouldst hazard for her sake: Euery vaine feare and danger thou dost proue, Is a sure pledge and token of thy loue: Oft had Leander without Hero slept, To find his loue into the sea he leapt. Thinke it no shame the fauour to deserue, Of euery Maid, that doth thy Mistris serue: To vse her maides. Salute them by their names in curteous sort, For these are they that can preferre thy sport. And more and more into their grace to grow, Some trifling gifts on each of them bestow: Especially regard her smiles or frowne:- Whose office is to brush her Mistris gownes: To her make meanes, for she is groome porter, Both to her bed, and such as do resort her: Great and rich gifts I do not bid thee send her, I meane thy loue, but knacks of value slender: What gifts to send her As when the ochard boughes are clagd with fruite, In some choice dish from thence comm?d thy suite And let the little page that beares them say, Though thou perhaps hast bought them by the way These pears, or plums, or graps which I present you As his first fruites were by Mistris sent you Or be they hazell nuts, or chesenuts great, Euen such as Amaritis lou'd to eate. Or a young Turkie, these will shew thy hart. These gifts send freely, lay thy gold apart: Such presents neuer bring men to dispaire, To vntimely age, or to tormenting care. O let them amongst others rot and perish. That hate mens person and their presence cherish. Send her [illeg.]rses.What shall I bid thee send her, meetred rimes. Alas, they find small honour in these times, Verses they praise, but gold they most require, If rich, though barbarous he commands desire: This is the golden age: not that of old, Both life and honour are now bought with gold. Though Homer bring the Muses in the traine, Yet without gold he may retire again: Some girles their be but they be passing few, Worthy to rancke amongst that learned crew. Others vnlearned there are yet would be held, As if in skill in iudgement they excel'd: Both let thy verses praise, and in a stile, Of sweetest posie their worthes compile: Perhaps thy laboured lines they may esteeme: Note.And like a slight gift thy sweet verses seeme. What thou intend'st to do by some fine feare, Cause of thy Lady may of thee entreat. Art thou by couenant tide, and must it be, That thou of force must set thy seruant free: Contriue it so, that it she dare protest, Thou hadst not freed him but at her request. Art thou for any rash offence asswag'd, So make thy peace, that she may be ingag'd: Do as thy profit leades thee and yet so, That she for euery thing thou dost may owe. Praise her attire.And thou that hast attain'd by passions deepe, Thy Ladies grace and wouldst her fauour keepe. Make her beleeue still when thou view'st her feature Through all the world she is the fairest creature. If cloth of Tire she weare that habit laud, Her Tertian vesture with thy tongue applaud. If silke which we from rich Arabia trafficke, Sweare such attire cannot be found through Affrick If cloth of gold she weare, tush gold is base, If you compare her habit to her face: If in the cold she but a freeze gowne weare, Then her perfection makes that garment deare. Is she compleatly drest, and rapt with ioy? Cry out aloud my heart burnes bright as Troy. Doth she aboue her forehead part her haire? That louely seene doth make her twice as faire: Are her curld locks in carelesse tresses dangled? Her dancing Her voice. In these crispe knots thy heart must be intangled. If she doth dance, admire her actiue feet, If sing then wonder at her voice so sweet. But when she ceaseth, either then complaine, Intreating her to try her skill againe, Do this and were her heart as hard as brasse, Or more obdurate then Medusaes was, Yet she in time shall be compeld to yeeld, And thou depart a Conqueror from the field: Onely beware of too apparent flattery, It will destroy the siedge and tedious battery. Dissembling with Art, tempered much imports, Else from all fature credit it dehorts: In Autumne when the yeare is in his pride. And the grape full with wine red's on the side. When the cleare aire keeps a deuided seate, Affording sometimes cold and sometimes heate. Women are prone to loue healthfull and quicke, But if by chance thy Lady be falne sicke, Make both thy loue, zeale, faith, &amp; all things cheap, Then sow what with full sickle thou maiest reape, Cast all about her longing thoughts to please, Seeme nor as if thou lothest her disease: Imploy thy hand in each thing done to her, These offices euen of themselues will woe her. Let her behold thee weepe as thou stands by That she may drinke each teare falls from thy eie. Vow manie things, but all in publicke stile Tell her thy pleasing dreames soe make her smile. And let the trembling nurse thought fit to watch, Bring in her shaking hand a kindled match: Let her peruse the bed and make it soft, Whilst with thy hand thou turnst &amp; rearst her oft: These are the easie footsteps thou maist tread, Which haue made way to manie a wanton bed: No such faire office can with hate be stained, Rather by these affection is soone gained. But minister no drugs of bitter iuice, Such let the riuall temper to his vse. Now greater gusts must to my Barks giue motion, Being from the shoare launcht forth into th'ocean. Young loue at first is weake and craues forbearing But in continuance gathers strength by wearing: Yon moodie bull of whom thou art afraid Being but a calfe thou with his hornes hast plaid. That tree beneath whose branches thou dost stand To sheeld thee from a storme was once a wand: A Riuer at the first not once a stride, Increaseth as he runs his waters wide, Receiuing in Fresh brookes in diuers ranks, Till he in pride haue overflowne his bankes, Vse to conuerse with her, the speeder knowes, What strength from custom &amp; acquaintance grows Frequent herFrequent her often, be from her, seld away. Keepe in her eare and eie both night and day, And yet sometimes from these thou maist desist, 'Tis good one should be asked for being mist Be absent from her some conuenient season, And let her rest a while it is but reason. Be absent from her. The field being spar'd returnes vs treble gaine, After great drough, the earth carrouses raine; Phillis did loue Demophoon but not doate, Vntill she saw his flying ship a floate. Penelope her absent Lord did mourne, So Laodemia did till the returne, Vlisses. Of her deare spouse but be not long away. Cares perish: new loue enters by delay. When Menelaus from his house is gone, Poore Hellen is afraid to lie alone: And to allay these feares lodg'd in her breast, In her warme bosome she receiues her guest. What madnesse was it Menelaus say, Thou art abroad whilst in thy house doth stay, Vnder the selfesame roofe thy guest and Loue, Madman vnto the Hawke to turne the Doue. And who but such a gull would giue to keepe, Vnto the mountaine wolfe full folds of sheepe, Hellen is blamelesse, so is Paris too, And did what thou or I my selfe would do. The fault is thine I tell thee to thy face, By limitting these louers time and place, From thee the seed of all thy wrongs are growne, Whose counsell hath she followed but thy owne. Alas what should she do, abroad thou art, At home thou leau'st thy guest to play thy part: To lie alone the poore wench is afraid, In the next roome an amorous stranger laid, Her armes are open to embrace him he falls in, And Paris I acquit thee of thy sinne: Neither the brisled Boare in his fierce wrath, Womans rage. Torne by the rauenous dogs more anger hath. Nor the she Lion hid within some ake, Seeking her lost whelpe, hid within some brake, Nor the short Viper doth more anger threaten, Whom some vnwarie heele hath crusht and beaten. Then a fierce woman shewes her selfe in mind, Her dearest in adulterous armes to find. Oh then she swells, her fierd eie bures apace, And you may see her thoughts writ in her face: Through swordes, through slames she rushes, ther's no ill. So grieuous but she acts it with her will: This breakes all mutuall loue though well compounded; This destroies all, though nere so firmelie grounded. Medea did her husbands guilt repaire. And with her bloudie hand Absiretis slay. Yon Swallow which thou seest wa such another, Before her transformation a fierce mother: And that he deeds may yet be vnderstood: The feathers other breast were staind with bloud But for all this I taske not thy affection, Of one, and her alone to make election: You Gods defend the fords should proue so deepe, These married men haue much adoe to keepe. Play you the wantons, but being done conceale it And by no brags or foolish boasts reueale it. Meete at no certaine houre, giue no knowne gift, Thy vsuall place of meeting often shift: It may be shroud disturbers to me may send thee, And spialls may be set to apprehend thee, And when thou writest peruse thy letter first, Before thou send some, take things at the worst. Venus being wrong'd, maks war still mouing sorrow Who late from others griefe their mirth did borrow Whilst Agamemnon liu'd with one contented, His Wife was chast and neuer it repented: His secret blows her heart did so prouoke, Wanting a sword she with the scabbard stroke, She heares of Chirses and the many iares, About Liruesis to increase the warrs: And therfore meer reuenge the Lady charmes, To take Thiestes in her amourous armes. If when thou hast gone on thy nightly arrant, The act by circumstance peares too apparant: Deny it stedfastly, what ere they know, And boldly face them that it was not so: Be not so sad or oft too mirthfull cheare. Least in thy countenance thy deeds appeare: In thy close meetings vse thy nimble knee, It may perhaps a bould intruder be. And after so repulsed scale the fort, But venture not too rashly on thy sport: Many there be by whose vnskilfull motions, You are prescrib'd strang drugs and diuers potions To make you lustie they are poysons all, To infect the body and inflame the gall. Pepper with biting nettle seed they mixe, Of bastard pellitory some few sticks: Which beaten and in old wine drunk vp cleare, Makes spightfull men aloft their standards beare, The Goddesse that beneath high Eripe raignes Vnto her pleasure no such bloud constraines: White skallions brought you from Megera eate, With garden sage make sallets to thy meate. Take new laid eggs, fresh hony from the Bees. Pine apple nuts full ripe, eate such as these: This holesome fare breeds nought, corrupt or tragicke, What hath my Art to do with hellish Magicke. Thou that but now wast bid thy guilt to hide, Turnes from that course, boast and in it take pride, Not blame the lightnesse of thy Tutors mind, You see we do not saile still with one wind, Sometimes the East, and when his fury sailes: West, North and South by turn doth fill our sailes The Chariot driuer sometimes slakes his raines, Sometimes againe horses he restraines. Many there be which calmes much doth blind, And if the finde a riuall grow vnkind: Prosperity makes humane minds grow ranck; Themselues to know, or their great God to thank, Nor is it held an easie taske to find, Men that all fortunes beare with equall mind. As fire, his strength being wasted hides his head, In the white ashes sleeping though not dead. And when a suddaine blast doth come by chance, Spare fire and light all wake as from a trance: So when with sloth and rest the spirits grow blunt Loue must be quickened euen as fire is wont. Make her to feare and to looke pale sometime, By shewing her some instance of thy crime: Which she suspected erst in some strange vaines, Must she abide whilst she thy guilt complaines. No sooner the report of this assailes her, But colour, voice, and euery sence strait failes her Then I am he whose face she madly tears, Whom she desire to haue straight by the eares Hate me she must and yet good God she may not, Without me liue she will (alas) but cannot, Dwell not vpon this passion, but at length. Make peace, in little time rage gathers strength: By this her white neck with thy arms imbrace, Drying the tears that trickle downe her face, Kisse her yet weeping, her yet weeping show. All the proud sweets the Queen of loue doth know This makes true concord in her greatest rage, These sports alone her passion can asswage. Peace goes vnarmd &amp; knows not warlicke fashions This happy peace is knowne among all Nations: Doues by their nobring songs shew their good wils But now they fought, &amp; now they ioyne their bills, The first confused Masse no order knew, Earth Sea and Heauen, had all one face, one hew: Strait was the heauens the earths large couering made The shore guirt in the Sea not to inuade, Either in others bounds then Chars ceast, And each thing in their seuerall part increast: The woods receiue the beasts, aire the birds take, Fish the Sea choose and the land forsake, Man wanders in the field and knows no art, Meare strength his body rules, meare lust his hart, Grous were his cities, shadowed bows his dwelling Water his drink all other drinks excelling, And long it was ere man the woman knew, Till pleasure did their appetites pursue, And then vpon these vnknown sweets she venterd Where many an vnsackt fort was scald and enterd Art they had none, no man then plaid the Sutor, But lay with her and liv'd without a tutor: Euen so one bird doth with another toy. And the male fish doth with the female ioy. The Hart the Doe doth follow, serpents to Are with the serpents held their feat to do: The hounds in their adulterate parts were fast. The ioyfull Ewe receiues the Ram at last. The Cow with lofty bellowing meets the Bull, And the ranke he Goate finds the female trull. The Mare to try the valiant horses courage Swims ouer fords, and doth large pastures forrage To thy offended loue giue this strong potion, And perfect friendship strait succeeds the motion. This medicine rightly tock all hate expels, Apply it then others it far excels, As I was writing, loe the God of fire, Appeares, and with his thou be he stroke his life. In his right hand a branch of Lawrell grew, A Lawrell chaplet I might likewise view, Circle his brow, though all men do not know it, This showes the Sunnes God PhÅbus is a Poet. Who after mouing of his head thus spake Mistris of Loue, thy amorous Schollers take, And lead them to my temple built on high, There is an old Sunne knowne in euery skie. Which by his Characts doth plainly show That euery man must learne himselfe to know: Alone he wisely loues that can do so. He that is faire may shew his amorous face, Whose skinne is white to do his colour grace. Ly naked with his necke and shoulders bare, Let him shun silence, whose discourse is rare. He that sings, sing by art, that drinks drink to, By art and without cunning nothing do. Let not the learnd in their words declame, Nor the vaine Poet prate of his owne fame. So PhÅbus warnes, PhÅbus himselfe hath said it. And his braue words are worthy to haue credit. To come more neare the Louer that Loues wisely, If these my precepts he obserue precisely: Shal reach his wish, th'earth brings not stil increase Ships when the winds keep in, their course do cease. Few be our helpes, but many be our troubles, Small is our furtherance which our let still doubles A Louer must endure much griefe besides, For euery Hare in Ãtho that abides. For euery berry that the Oliue yeelds, For euery spike of grasse sprong in the fields: For euery shell strowed on the salt sea shore, Loue hath one grief to tast, and ten griefs more. Art told that she abroad, but now did wonder, Yet in the window seest her with her Pander. Blame thou thine eies, for it shall much auaile thee Think not that newes, but that thy eie sight fail'd thee, Locks she the doore she promised to leaue open. O thinke not she deceitfully hath spoken. Take vp thy lodging make thy bed thy floore, Thy pillow the cold threshold of the doore: Perhaps a Maide from high may cast a flout, And aske what's he doth keep the gates without. Yet both the Maide and rude posts do thou flatter, Sprinkling the seats and portalls with rose water. If she call come if bid thee go, then trudge. Railes she vpon thee, doth she call thee drudge: Nay doth she knocke thee, beare it, it is meete, Nor scorne it though she bid thee kisse her feet: I dwell on trifles, greater matters heare, To which thou people lend a generall eare: On stricter impositions now we enter. Vertue is still imployed no hard aduenter. A riuall brooke do this and by Ioues power, Thou art inthrong'd a Conquerour in his tower, Oh thinke me not a man that thus doth teach, Some rough hew'd oake doth this hard doctrine preach. This is the hardest thing I can impose thee, If she defie beare it, if she showes thee Her hand; forbeare to read it euery day, When she calls come, when she comm?ds thee stay This euen the married to lead peacefull liues, Art oft enforc'd to endure of their faire wiues. I am not perfect I must needs confesse, In this my art, though I this art professe, What shall I then my word I cannot keepe, I haue no power to swim a sea so deepe, Shall any kisse my Lady I being by: And to his throat shall I not madly fly. Shall any becken to her and I beare it, Shall any court her and I stand to heare it I saw one kisse my Mistris I complained, And anger all my vitall spirits constrained. My loue alas with Barbarisme abound, And doth my wits and spirits whole confound: That Wittoll is much better skild then I, Who sees such sights, and patiently stands by. To keepe the room where such things are in place, Despoiles the front of shamefastnesse and grace: Then oh you young men though you come to view Your looks beguile you, do not think it true Surprise her [illeg.].Against all censures I euer hold this plea, It is not good to take them Res in Re. Where two are taken napping both alike, Their mutuall guilt makes them the oftner strike, The tale of Venus and Mars.This tale through heauen is blazd how vnwars Venus and Mars was taken in Vulcan, snares The God of war doth in his brow discouer, The perfect and true patterne of a Louer. Nor could the Goddesse Venus be so cruell, To deny Mars, soft kindesse is a Iewell. In any woman, and become her well, In this the Queen of Loue doth most excell. Oh God) how often haue they mockt and flouted, The smiths polt foot, which nothing th? misdoubted: Made iests by him and by his begrimd trade, And his smudg'd vissage black with coledust made. Mars tickled with loud laughter when he saw, Venus like Vulcan limpe, and halt, and draw, One foot behinde another with a grace, To counterfeit his odde and vn euen pace. Their meeting first they did conceale with feare, From euery searching eye and captiues eare. The God of war and his lasciuious Dame. In publicke view were full of bashfull shame. But the Sunne spies how this sweet paire agree, Oh that bright PhÅbus can be hid from thee. The Sunne both sees and blabs the sight forthwith And in all post he speeds to tell the Smith. Oh Sunne what bad example dost thou show, What thou in secret seest must all men know. For silence ask a brib from her faire treasure, She'l grant thee that shal make thee swel with pleasure The god whose face is smudgd with smok and fire, Placeth about the bed a net of wire. So quiently made that it deceiues the eye, Stait as he faines to Lemnos he must hie: The louers meet where he the traine hath set, And both lay cacht within the wiery net. He calls the Gods, the louers naked spraule And cannot rise, the Queene of Loue shewes all. Mars chafes, and Venus weepes, neither can flinch Grappled they lye, in vain they kicke and winch: Their legs are one within anothers ty'd, Their hands so fast that they can nothing hide. Among these high spectators once by chance, That saw them naked in this pitfall dance: Thus to himselfe said, if that it tedious be, Good God of warre bestow thy place on me. Scarce at thy prayers god Neptune he vnbound th? But would haue left th? as the gods ther found th? The nets vntide, Mars strait repaires to Creet, Venus to Paptes, after that they meet. What did this help thee Vulcan, shall I tell thee, Vnto more griefe and rage in will compell thee: The publicke meeting which at first shame couers Is now made free; who knowes not they be louers. There is no hope they should be now reclam'd, Worse then they haue been, how should they be sham'd Of thy rash deed it often doth repent thee, Mad art thou in thy mind, yet must content thee: This I forbid you so doth Venus too, It harm'd her, and she forwarnes it you. Lay for thy riuall then no secret snares, Nor intercept his tokens vnawares: Let those close prancks by such iust men be tride, That are by fire and water purifide. Behold once more I giue you all to know, Saue wanton loues my art doth nothing show: No gouern'd Matron well and chastly guided, I here protest is in my verse derided. What prophane man at Ceres kites dare smile, Or blab her secrets kept in Samos Ile. Silence is held a vertue, silence then, Tels taile and blabs, fie, Venus hates such men: For blabbing Tantalus is plac'd in hell. An there must euer and for euer dwell. Hungry, whilst ripened fruit hangs by his lip, Thirsty, whilst water by his chin doth slip: But Venus more desires then any other, Her secret misteries and rights to smother. I charge you let no tell-tales hither come, Such amongst manie there must needs be some: Hide her reports from euerie eare that lists, And locke her secrets vp in brazen chests. In their new births till pleasures buried lie, Twixt vs they grow, betwixt vs let them die. Her naked parts, if she to any showes, Her readiest hand to shadow them she throwes, The shamelesse beasts in common field do stray, And act their generation at noone day. Which Maides by chance espying, cry oh spight, And through their fingers looke to see the sight. But when our Louer with his mistris meets, Haue beds &amp; doores shut twixt them and the streets With clothes &amp; vailes their nawednes they shroud Wishing the bright Sunne hid behind some cloud. Euen in those daies when men on Acorns fed, And the greene turfe was made the generall bed: When no thatcht cottage or poore house was builded. By which from heate of cold they might be shielded. Into the woods and caues the people went: And their sweet pleasures there remotely spent. In the Sunnes presence they shew'd nothing bare. The rudest and most barbarous had his care. As loath the day should view their publick shames, Now to their nightly actions they giue names, Bargaines and price is made in all their doings, And nothings costs vs dearer then our woings. Let not thy talke be when thou com'st in place, To say she, this, on that wench did me grace: Noath. Or point then with thy finger, [illeg.] may fall Thus thou maist loose her whom thou louest &amp; all Others there be from street to street do wander, And innocent women in their shops do slander. Forging of them they know not many a lye, Which were they true t[illeg.] gladly would deny: For who command not they their spoile is such, Whose breast they cannot fold their nams the tuc[illeg.] Go then thou odious Pander that keeps whores, A thousand locks hang fast vpon thy doores: Part of her honest canst thou keepe within, When her whole name abroad is full of sinne; Do not their wanton wishes make them nought, When they desire to be as they are thought: Necessary obseruations in a louer.Sincearest Loues we sparingly do teach, Yet like no publicke craft their names impeach, Dissemble euery fault in their complections, Hit not in womens teeth their imperfections. I wish you rather smother them, then blame them, They loue if you praise them, hate if shame them: Andromeda was belly sides and backe. To Perseus seen, he did not tearme her blacke. Andromeda she was of to huge a stature, One louing Hector prais'd her gifts of nature: And lik'd her selfe, at the first despised. Seem not so grosse when men be well aduised. Continuance and acquaintance wears away. Such spots as are apparant the first day: A young plant clothed in a tender rinde. Cannot withstand the fury of the winde, But when his bark is growne, he scorns each blast, In spight of whom he grows and bears at last, Euery succeeding week and following day, Takes from acquainted lookes a staine away. And what to day a grosse blot thou wouldst guesse Tomorrow in thy eye appeares much less Young Heifers cannot be tickt to beare. The ranke and lustie Bull for the first yeare: But their society acquaints the smell, After continuance they can brooke it well. Then fauour their disgraces and relieue them, Blemishes helpe by the good names you giue them To her whose skin is blake as Ebon was. I haue said ere now, Oh 'tis a good browne lasse. Or if she look as quint, as I am true, To Venus looks if she be black of hew, [illeg.]ale for the world like Pallas be she growne: [illeg.]ellow by heauens Minerua vp and downe: [illeg.] she be tall then for her height commend her, She that is leane like Enuie terme her slender: She that is dwarfish name her light and quick, And call her well set grubbed thick, She that is puft like Boreus in the cheek, Is but full fac'd, and Daphne she is like: Thus qualifie their faults, not to disgrace them, But in a higher rank of beautie place them: Or hapnest thou of but one dimme of fight, Wrinckled her brow, her grisled haire tur'nd white Her nose and chin halfe meet she would take scorn To tell who Counsell was when she was borne. Then if to such thy loue thou wilt engage, Looke that at no time thou dost aske her age. Though she wants teeth and haue a flattering tong Yet she takes paines to be counted young, This is the age young men that brings the gaine: And plenteous harvest of the springtides paine, Employ your selues then in your youth &amp; strength, Age with a soft space steales on you at length. Spend thou the youth at Sea or till the land, Or take a warlicke weapon in thy hand: Follow the wars, siege townes, or lye in trenches Or if not so, then learn to loue faire wenches. It is a warfare too, when men are trained, And euen by this employment wealth is gained: Such discipline, such practise must be vsed By vs, as those who hostile armes haue chused. Some women by their industry and paines, The losse of yeares recouers and regaines: Times speedy course is by their art controld. They can preferre themselues from seeming old, Their amorous pastimes and lasciuious playes, They shape and fashion many thousand wayes: With sundry pleasures they their trade commixe; And euery seuerall day deuise new tricks They can prouoke the appetite and please it, Coniure the spirit vp and straite appease it: But these rich feasts of sweets which they prepare Women and men should both of euen hands share I hate the bed that yeelds not mutuall ioyes, And thats the cause I loue not iugling boyes: I hate her denies that no spirit will vse, Yeelding no more then what she cannot chuse. I like not pleasure, though I like the beautie, Lasses of Loue performe not but of duty: Duty away, I banish thee the place, Where mutuall Louers mutuall sweets embrace, Let me the musicke of her soft voice heare, Whispering her rauisht pleasures in my eare, To bid me on, then pause, proceed, then stay, And tired with that, to try some other way, Let me behold her eyes turne vp the whites, Now to be rapt, now languish in delights. These prodigall pleasures nature hath not giuen, To the first age a little aboue seauen. The wine that from the vnripe grape is prest, Is tart, and sower, the mellow wine tasts best: The palme tree till it hath a well growne rinde, Cannot withstand the violence of the winde. The mead new mowne doth pricke the feet that's bare Igrant thee young Hermione was faire: But to preferre the girle before the mother, The beautious Hellen neither one nor other Can so blaspheme, heres Gorge some adore her: But who praise her before the Saint that bore her Now I suppose ripe fruites I most approue, And in my thoughts I couer mellowed loue. Yon bed new tost, behold where it discouers, The curtaines being drawne to wanton louers: There stay my muse, no further now proceed, Without thy help they both can speak and speed. Without thy help kind words will quickly passe, Betwixt the Louer and his amorous Lasse: Without thy help their hands will nimble creep, And in each ticklish place their office keep. Nay euery finger will it selfe imploy. To adde increase to thy imperfect ioy: Handling those parts where loue his darts doth hide, This valaiant Hector with his wife hath tride: Andromache to this of force must yeeld, His vallour was not onely for the field: This stout Achilles of his loue desired, When with the slaughter of his enemies tired. He daught his cushes and vnarm'd his head: To tumble with her on a downe soft bed; Thou didst reioyce Driseis to embrace, His bruised corpes, and kisse his blood slaind face. These warlicke hand that did but late embrew. Themselues in bloud of Troians whom they slew Were now imploy'd to tickle touch and feele, And shake a lance that hath no point of steele: Beleeue me for I spaek as I haue tasted, The sports of Venus are not to be hasted. They should be rather by degrees prolonged: By too much speed much oft the sport is wronged When thou by chance hast hit vpon the place, Which being toucht a girle still hides her face: For beare not though she blush &amp; spring &amp; kicke, And tumbling shew thee many a gamble tricke. Thou shalt behold her straitely still amazed. Her eyes with a lascivious tincture glazed Affording a strange kinde of humide light, As when the Moone in water shines by night. Let neither amorous words cease their inchanting Murmure nor whispering sounds of ioyes wanting Yea their let euery sweet content resort, Euery word, deed and thought that furthers sport Let not thy Mistris vse to swift a saile, Nor let thy hast beyond her speed preuaile: Both keep one course your oares together strike, Your iourneys on then, make your pace alike. Together striue at once win to the marke, You may no question grope it in the dark Then is the fulnesse of all sweet content, When both at once striue both at once are spent Such course obserue when as the time is free: And that no iealous eyes attend on thee: Being secure no future danger neare Then thou maist boldly dally without feare But if thou beest not safe, and hast short leasure, Doubtfull to be disturbd amidst thy pleasure, Make then what speed thou canst, vse all thy force And clap a sharpe spurre to a iade pack horse: My worke is at an end the palme bring me, And let the Mirtle garland be my fee How much renowned great Pollidorus was, That all the Greeks in Phisick did surpasse, As famous as great Nestor for his age, Or strong Achilles for his warlike rage. As much extold as Calchas for his charmes, Or Telemonius Aiax by his arms: As for his Chariot skill AntomedÃ²n, So great in Loue shall I be censur'd on. Cannonize me your Poet, giue me praise, And crowne my Temples with fresh wreathes of bayes: Let this my land in euery mouth be song, And my fams clanger though the whol earth rong [illeg.] giue you armour, such god Vulcan framed, So great Achilles he his enemies tamed. And so do ye, but what soere he be, That by my armes subdues his enemy: This Motto let him giue, lo her's a Lasse By Ouid my arts Master conquered was: Behold young Wenches likewise craue my skill They shall be next instructed by my quill. FINIS. THE THIRD BOOKE. Arm'd at all points, the Greeke to field is gone To encounter with the naked Amazon: Behold like weapons in my power remain. For the Penthisilea and thy traine. Go arm'd alike, fight and they ouercome, Whom sacred Venus fauours and her sonne: It were not meet poore naked girles should stand, To encounter men prouided hand to hand. To conquer at such odds 'twere shame for men, Oh but some say, why Ouid should they pen: Put poyson into snakes, or giue to keepe, Vnto the rauenous Woolfe a fould of sheep, Oh for some few offenders do not blam, All of their Sexe, let not a generall shame: For some few falters their whole brood inherit, But euery one be centurd as they merit. Although the two Atrides hath their liues, Endangered both by falshood of their wiues: Though false Eriphile her husband sould, To Polinydes for a chaine of gould: Yet did the faire Penelope liue chast, While twice fiue yeares her royall Lord did wast: In bloudie battels and as many more, Wandring through euery sea and vnknowne shore So did the chast Phillacides and she, That partner of her husbands griefe to be, Went with him as his page a tedious way; And in the trauell died before her day: Oh happy Pherecides thy wife. From death redeemed thee with her owne life. Receiue me oh you flames did Iphias cry, And with my buried husband let me die, And with that word she skips into the fire, All faire endowments that we can desire. Raigne in a womans breast no maruele then. They with adorned vertues please vs men: But these chast minde my art inioyneth not, A softer saile will serue to guide my boate: Nothing but wanton loue flowes from my braines How pretty wenches may scape men traines A woman neither flames nor swords will shun, But through them both: vnto her sweet heart run; So will not men, poore girles by them are scoft, Many times men faile, maides sometimes, not oft: False Iason left Medea and her charmes: To claspe another Mistris in his armes. As much as in thy power false Theseus lay. So right Ariadne was a wofull pray: To the Sea foules and Monsters left alone, In a remote place friendlesse and vnknowne, Many vncertaine waies hath Phillis gone, Being forsaken of her Demophoon. And though Ãneas had no sirname good, He left his sword to let out Didos bloud: But what destroy you Ladies can you tell, You know not how to loue or fashion well, Your thoughts to art, Loue artles stands vnsure, Are with loue tempered is strong to endure: Nor should you know it now, but that the Queene Of sacred Loue was in my vision seene: And straitly charg'd me that I should impart. To all the Sex the secret of my art. For thus she spake how haue poore maides misdone That against armed men must naked run. Two books haue giuen men weapons in their hands The whilest our fearefull Sex vnarmed stands: He that rebuk'd Therapnes lewd desire, Since song her praises to a sweeter lire: Thy selfe examine, canst thou do them domage, To whom in time thou maist perform due homage This hauing said she tooke from off her brow, A mirtle wreath, for in a mirtle bow, Her haire was twisted vp and gaue to me, Of leaues and seeds a little quantitie. Strait in my braine I felt a power diuine, Whilst in the place a purer aire did shine; And all the cares that hung vpon my heart, Euen at that instant I might feele depart. My wits at ripest, are wenches come thicke, Receiue my precepts whilst my wits are quicke: First thinke how old age hourely doth attend: To steale vpon thee so be sure to spend. Women loose no time.No season idly, thou art young then play, Yeares like the runing waters glide away Thou canst not stay the flouds it streames so fast, Nor pull the houres backe when they are past; Make vse of time for time is swift and fleet, Nor can the following good be all so sweet: As the first pleasure was, haue I not seene, This now a withered stalke once fresh and greene: From that bare throwne within these many howers I had a chaplet of sweet smelling flowers: The time shall come when thou that dost exclude, Such louers from thy doores as would intrude. Shall on an empty pillow through thy head, Stretching thy stiffe limmes on a frostie bed: Nor in the night shalt thou be rais'd vp late By such as knock and thunder at the gate. Nor in the morning when the cocke hath crowed, Find porch and threshod with fresh roses strowed: [illeg.]ime how soone doth the cleare coulour fade, How quickly wrincles in thy skin are made. Looke on thy looke and thou wilt sadly sweare, Age hath too soone snowed on thy golden haire: Snakes through their age of when they chang their skinne, Harts when they cast their heads fresh strength begin: And's giuen to them, when that in age ye grow Ye haue no heads to cast no skins to throw, Your good flies helples, therefore pluck the flower Which being gathered withers in an hower: In many childe birth age is quickly crept, Fields soone grow leane, that so often reapt. You see Endinion by the Moone lou'd still, Nor doth she blush thereat and by thy will: Aurora thou would euer haue the name, Of Cephalus thy deare, nor thinkst it shame. And to conceale thee Adonore whose hearse Venus her selfe hung many a tragicke verse, Tell vs by whom you Queen-borne of the sea. Had you Ãneas and Hermione. Oh mortall generation follow these. And practise after them being goddesses: Do not deny your rauishing pleasures when, They are besought you by desirous men. Tell me what loose you by it, what thou hast, Thou art possest of still, and feelst no wast: Take thence a thousand sweets be not affraid, Thou keepest thy owne, and nothing is decai'd. Stones are by vse made soft, iron worne to drosse, That neuer weares and therfore findes no losse: Who will deny vs at a torch being light, To light a taper till it burne as bright. Or who would striue in their owne power to keepe, All the spare billowes in the vastie deepe: Yet will a woman pleade her loue is rare, And in her plenty she hath nought to spare. Oh tell me why so strange a doubt thou mak'st, Dost thou but loose the water that thou takest: I speake not this to prostrate every one, But lest you seare vaine losse where losse is none. Now greater gusts my swelling saile must straine, Neatnesse required in a woman.Being from the shoare new lancht into the maine First with their neatnes I begin, the vine Well trim'd and prunde affords vs choyse of wine And in a field well till'd the corre growes tall, Shape is the gift of God, none amongst you all, But in there shapes take pride, nay there be many Proud of their fauour when they scarce haue any. Proportion euen the greatest number want, But rare supplies where nature hath been scant: Care makes the face, the face a while neglected: Will grow to ruine, and be nought respected, The Virgins of the old time had this care, Their bodies and their beauties to repaire: Else had the men of former ages spent, Their yeares without their wonted ornament. If you behold Andromache go clad, In manly robes, no maruaile, for she had A souldier to her husband, if you see The wife of Aiax iet it valiantly, Nor marvaile, for she was his wife that bare. A shield of seauen oxe-heads thick tan'd with haire. The world was plaine, simple and rude of old, But now abundant Rome doth flow with gold: And shines in glory with the bright reflection, All the worlds wealth is vnder their subiection. Behold the Capitall and thou wilt say, In these great Ioue hath choos'd to dwell for aye: This gorgeous Court &amp; Counsel house was framed Out of meere stubble when king Latius raigned. These gorgeous Pallaces that against the Sunne, Did glitter and shine when they first begun: A pasture for draught oxen: let them ease, Their thoughts with ancient times whom old times please I thanke the gods I in this age was borne, These times my humour fits, old dayes I scorne. Not because gold in the earths vaines are sought, Or shels, or stones, fr? forraigne shores are brought Not because marble from the hills is dig'd, Or voyage ships to vnknowne seas are rigd. But because rudnesse to the gates is sent, And this our age is full of ornament, Hang in your eares bright stones, but not to deare Such Iudyes cast vp and are sold you here: Neatnesse we loue, your haire in order tie, To keepe in within Law thy hands apply: Thy hands mishape keeps still and by her care, Thou maist oreseeme, deformed or woundrous faire Nor is there onely one kind of attire, The fashion that becomes thee best desire, Proue euery shape, but ere it current passe, See thou before take counsell from thy Lasse. A long and leane visage best allowes, To haue the haire part iust aboue the browes: So Laodemeia sirnamed the faire, Vsed when she walk'd abroad to trusse her haire. A round plumpe face must haue her trammels tied In a fast knot aboue her front to hide: The wier supporting it whilst either eare: Bare, and in sight vpon each side appeare. Yon Ladies locks about her shoulders fall, And her loose ware becomes her best of all: So PhÅbus look't when last he toucht his Lute, That other Lady doth her habit suite, With chast Diana being trickt to go, To strike the sauage bore or tameless Roe. She when her haire hangs loose hath greatest pride This best becomes her when her locks are tyed: Yon when her head tire is like a tortoise shell, Is roost and vawted well be seemes it well: More leaues the Forrest yeelds not from the trees, More beasts the Alpes breed not, nor Hibla bees: Then there be fashions of attire in view, Euery succeeding day adds somthing new. Many become their tires best when they weare: In stead of sprucenes a neglected haire: And being comb'd but now yet thou shalt say, Her haire hath not been toucht since yesterday. Art doth much change, so did Alcides see, Iolattired, and said this wench is for me, So Inossis whom the god of grapes commended, When by his shouting Satires being attended: He found her plac'd locks by the cool wind shifted With scatterred haire her to his coach he lifted. How much oh nature are we bound to thee, That findes for euery griefe a remedy. And as our shapes and colour suffer crosse, To helpe the defects of nature. Yet thou hast in thee to repaire that losse. Say that by age or some great sicknes had, Thy head with wonted haire be thinly clad: Falling away like corne from ripened sheaues, As thicke as Boreas blowes downe Autum leaues. By Germane yearbes thou maist thy haire restore, And hide the bare scalpe that was bald before, Women haue knowne this art, and of their crew, Many false colours buy to hide the true. And multitudes, yea more then can be told, Walke in such haire as they haue bought for gold: Haire as good Marchandize and growne a trade, Markets and publicke trafficke thereof made, Nor do they blush to cheapen it among, The thickest number and the rudest throng. Nay euen before Alcides sacred flames, And in the presence of the vestall Dames: To leaue their haire, and speake of their attire I do not trailes or purfled guards desire. Nor roabes of blush scarlet prized hie, Whose wooll is twice dipt in the Tirian dye: Looke but abroad and thou maist in a trice, Find lighter colours and of farre lesse price. Were it not madnesse thou in scorne of lacke, Should wear at once thy whole wealth on thy back Behold the colour of the azure aire, When in a cloudles day the skie is faire: And the South wind bring on the earth no showers As once it did what time one flow deuoures. Pbrixus and Hellis, such a colour chuse, Tis neat, and cheape, but costly dyes refuse: That prettie colour intimates the waues, And from their sea greene drops a name it craues In this the young Nymphes went apparrl'd most, This saffron immitates of no great cost, And yet she goes attired in saffron weeds, That euery morning decks faire PhÅbus steeds Else such a dye as Paphian mirtles yeeld, Or purple Amethistos or a field: Where nothing saue the milke white roses grow, Or of that hew the Thratian Cranes do show Let not faire Amarilles wanting be, Thy ackhornes or thy bloomes of Almond tree, All these of seuerall colours iuice be full. And with the seuerall colours staine the wooll: So many sundry flowers as the fresh spring. In spight of winters horrid rage doth bring. To decke the earth with full so many hues. The thirstie earth doth drink and none refuse. [illeg.]their attire to their [illeg.]tions,Mongst which faire women out of your affections, Choose them that shall become best your complections: She that is browne let her attire be white, Briseus ware a Robe of colour light. When she was rauisht others that are saire, Let their attires be black as Sables are, Swarthie Andromed ware a milk white smocke, When she was tied halfe naked the rocke. Lest you be seene so let no ranknes grow, Betwixt you armes and shoulders let none show. Of rough and ragged hairs there may appeare, Vpon your legs and thighs but not to neare: I do not teach young maids by Cauease bred: Or such as drink of Risus but in sted Of barbarous t[illeg.]uls to you braue girles of Rome, Do I direct my phrase, and to your dome. I now instruct you then your teeth to fret, Lest in their vse some furdnes they do get: To keepe their teeth. To wrince your mouthes in water you haue wit, To apprehend my words betimes to sit. And in the morning take away the slime, Which makes the white teeth subiect to such crime Let such whose blouds are blacke and swart Whom nature reds not, make them red by art: Art likewise fills the wrinkles in the browes, Cheekes. A skinne of died red leather art allowes, To rub your faces with, nor hold it shame, To kindle in your eyes a sparke of flame, It may be done with saffron, which like corne, Grows near bright Cyduas wheras thou wert borne I haue a little booke in substance small, And yet a worke of weight writ to you all. The Treatise is vnto your generall races, How you by art may best preserue your faces: You whose rare beauties haue receiu'd a scar, Seeke thence your helps, receipts there written are You may there find how to restore your blouds. My art was neuer idle to your goods. Beware lest that by chance your boxes lye Vpon the table, and your Loues passe by: Throw them aside, art spreads her safest net, When she is with most cunning counterfet. Spill not thy drugs alike in euery place, They will offend such as behold thy face, Corrupting the beholder with such motion, As should he see thy garments stand with lotion, How doth the greasie franck woolls smell offend, Though we for it as far as Athens send, Yet is it good for vse, not before men, Vse thou Deares marrow good for medicen: Nor before men in presence rub thy teeth, They both are good, yet harsh to him that seeth, Many things which in doing we detest, Being once done they oft times please vs best: These stately pillars in iron caru'd and wrought, Were a confused rocke, this ring now brought, To that good forme, was once vnfashioned ore, The costly cloth thou wearest a rough sheepe bore The curious picter of faire Venus was, Before the cutting an vnpolisht masse. Mind thou thy beauty when we think thee sleeping Thy hand, thy boxe, thy glasse their office keeping: Why should I know how thou art growne so faire, Shut fast the forge where beauties ioyned are. For many things there be men should not know, The greatest part of them if you should show. They should offend them much spare not to shroud The doing, though the thing done be allowed. The golden ensignes yender spreading fare, Which wasts them to the gorgeous Theater: See what thin leaues of gold foile guilde the wood, Making the columes seeme all massie good: Yet are the audience of all sight debarred, Untill the showes and sights be full prepared: Note.So in thy preparation marke this note, Still make thee ready in a place remote: Obserue this woman.Yet sometimes if they head be wondrous faire, Euen before men tis good to combe thy haire, The haire a beauty hath which much besots, Being tyed and wreathed in pleats &amp; comely knots, But be not tedious in thy art applying, Be quick both in the fasting and vntying: Still when thou goest to drosse thy selfe be safe, I hate those sullen pettish things that chase At euery idle crosse, who scrath and bite, And with their nailes and bodkins pinch and fight: Wounding themselues in anger, rending, tearing, The wires, the tires, the ruffes which they be wearing, She that is badly haired, let her before She dresse her selfe, set watch still at the doore, Vpon the suddaine 'twas my chance one day, To presse into the place where my sweet hart lay: When wondring she vnwares was thrust vpon, Snatch vp her haire, and put the wrong side on. Like cause of shame let come vnto my foe, And such disgrace vnto the Parthians go: A scalded breast, fields that no grasse will beare, Trees without leaues, and heads that haue no haire Are odious to the eye none of you three, Europa, Leda, or faire Senebe. Were subiect to his want or me did need, The helpe of Physicke in this point to reed: Nor Hellen thou whom with aduisement deepe: Menelaus askes; the Troiane still doth keepe: The wanton wenches in full troopes passe hither, Good, bad, faire, foule, of all sorts flocke together: And come to be instructed amongst which Oft times the faire be poore the foule be rich. And yet the fairest haue of me lest need, Theirs beuatie is a dower that doth exceed My precepts farre, the sea being calme and cleare, The secure Seaman all his sailes may beare. But when it swells and is disturb'd apart, The troubled Pilot must try all his art, Of euery little mole be thou not squeamish, 'Tis hard to finde a face that hath no blemish. Yet shalt thou seeke to hide the least disgrace, Either in tho proportion or thy face. A lesson for Dwarfes.If thou beest short thy stature hide by wit, Still sit, lest standing thou beest tooke to sit. And stretch thy legs at length out in thy bed: Lest that thy stature there be measured: Loue Dwarfes, obserue my words I hold it meet, To haue some garment throwne vpon thy feet: Remedy for them that [illeg.]he leane.She that is wearish and no clothes can fill, Her double plated gowne must sit by skill. To make her portly whilest a robe vnbound, From her two shoulders falls vnto the ground, Pale. Blacke. Splay foote.She that is pale, with purple staine her cheekes She that is blacke the fish of Pharoes seekes. A splay mish a pen foote in white shoes hide And let dryed legs were a rich garter tide: Let such whose shoulder blades stand much in sight Weare boulster'd gownes to make them seeme vpright, To slender.About a faint and slender body weare. A flannell swathband or warme stomacher, Such whose fat hands are itchy in the ioynt, Scabbed hands. Stinking breathes.Wh? they discourse let them not vse to point, You that haue stinking breathes must not speak fasting But helpe themselues by some good breakfast tak?g Else chewl a cloue the strength of it to breake, Or keepe some distance of still when you speake: Bad toothed.Or if thy teeth in wide vneuen ranks grow, Or be they gag'd, black or too great in show: Rot, lost, or that the fashion disagreeth, Beware of laughing, laughing shewes the teeth: Who would beleeue this, wonder yet 'tis true, Maides may be taught to laugh and to eschew Vncomely mouthes and harsh tricks of the face, In laughing is much vncomelines and grace: Be moderate in thy flearing, there's a feate, To be obseru'd in that make not to great. The hallow pits mirth digs in euery cheeke, To hide thy gummes let both thy red lips meete. Nor do thou stretch thy entrailes by constraining, Thy selfe vnto loud laughter netheir feining: A more familiar gesture with voice flat, Sound out a womanish noise I know not what. Looke but on them that with loud yalling force, Anticke and peruerse faces what shewes worse: And there is such a coile with wry mouthes kept, That wh? they laugh, a man would swear they wept Many with vntun'd clamor hoarce and shrill, Ball as the slow Asse bayes out of the mill, What cannot art? women are taught to weepe, How to weepe. And in their lookes a sober forme to keepe: To shape their eies according to their passion, Both at what time they please, and in what fashion Is there not grace in lisping to be sound, How to lispe. To giue true words a forged imperfect sourd: Robbing the tongue his office in some part Euen in deprauing words is sometimes art. Many that by my words my meaning scan, Are taught to speake lesse perfect then they can. Weigh these my words according to their worth, And these being coud take other lessons forth: Learne how with womanish pace to vse your gate, To go. In euery step there is a kinde of state Nor is their ought that yet my art discouers, Which with more violence drawes or criues backe louers Behold you Ladies gate the rest out strips, See with what cunning she doth moue her hips: And in the pride of steps how the cold wind. Swels her loose vailes before her and behind. This like the blushing wife of Vember paceth, Her full viewed legs at euery stride she graceth. Long measured steps do fit the state of some, Others a moderate pace doth best become: As far as where the armes and shoulders parts, How farre [illeg.] appeare [illeg.]are.As far as where the armes and shoulders parts. Appeare thou bare to wound the amourous harts, Of wanton youthes, this fashion vnderstand, Longs to the faire, not such whose skins be tand. Such sights ere now haue made me I protest, To kisse her necke, her shoulders and her breast, The Sirens are Sea-monsters, whose sweet notes Draws to their tunes the wandring ships and botes: And if their eares with wax they do not stop, Sing.They are charm'd to leape vp from the hatches top Song is a faire endowment, a sweet thing, A praisefull gift then woman learn to sing, Hard fauord girles by songs haue wonne such graces. Their sweet shrill tongs haue prou'd bands to their faces. Somtimes rehearse a speech brought from the play Or else peruse some poeme in thy way. Of Musicke I would haue thee know the skill, With thy right hand to vse a Rebecks quill. Or with thy left a harpe when Orpheus plaid, The beasts, &amp; trees, and stones to dance he made: And in his way to hell no fiend durst stirre, Nor tartar power, nor tripple headed Curre. Thou that so iustly do thy mother punish, Didst by thy Musicke skill the world astonish: In those sweet walkes that were by Musicke rear'd, By euery tuch sweet harmony is heard: The armed Dolphin is by nature mute, Yet did he lift Arion to thy Lure. Learne Musicke then and hope to play vpon. The double handed sweet Psaltirion. Reade Poetrie the workes of Cous seeke, Or great Callimacchus that writ in Greeke: The laboured lines of Bacchus Poet get, Read what lasciuious Sapho else both writ. For what more wanton workes then Sapho liues, See what delight to the Proportuis giues: Or if thy further leasure serue thee looke, In Gallus workes, or in Tibullus booke. Or Varro that of Phrixus and his neece, The Legend writ, and of the golden fleece: Or read Ãneas banishment from Troy, Th'originall of Rome, Rome doth enioy: No bookes more famous, hapbly to my grace, Some one may say thou Ouid hast a place. Amongst the rest thou and thy lines may sound, To aftertimes, not be in Sethe drown'd. Some one may say perchance our Master read, The booke he last drew with a double head Or those three bookes which he Amo[illeg.]nm calls, Entituling them of loue which of them falls, Into thy handling first that do thou choose, And louingly my louing lines peruse, Or with a composd voice my Cantons sing: The vse of these Loues mistris first did bring: To other yet vnknowne oh PhÅbus graunt, Graunt this you gods whom sacred Poets haunt. With their oblations, grant these powers deuine, Thou god of grapes, and you oh Muses nine: Who doubts but I would haue you learne to dance Measure and Galliards shall your name aduance, Command your armes and hands that they agree, Vnto the motion of the foote and knee. In mouing of the body hand and side, The commicke Actor cannot take more pride. Nor vse more art the comlinesse of either, Concurres, and I compare them both together Learne triuall sports, but oh your Poet shames, To game.To bid you be experienc'd in some games. Yet long they to my art then be not nice, To learne to play at cockall or at dice: How to cast lots and chances which to guesse, To play at draughts at tables or at chesse To vse a racket or to tosse a ball, At set game, or at that we bandy call: To passe the night at balliards till eleauen, At pickapandie, cards, or odd or euen. Play prepares loue, your skill is not so needfull, As ought to be your lookes and carriage heedfull, Your greatest cunning is with art to frame, The gesture and the countenance in your game: Game makes vs earnest if we play with care, Then with our open thoughts our breasts lie bare. And straite we brawle and scold a grieuous staine, Oh these be monstrous faults to chide and raile, Or to blaspheme the Gods when our lucke faile: To vow to sweare, with protestations deepe And in the heate of play to fret or weepe. Great Ioue himselfe from you such crimes expell. Who couet suitors and to please them well. Natures these triuall sports to woman lends A freer scope of pastimes she extends. By much vnto vs men, for so we may Scourge tops, fling darts, and at the football play: Vault, ride, and teach the horse to trot the ring, Frequent the Fenceschoole, practise armes, leape, spring. Nor can you march or muster on the sea, Or like the Merchant venturer go to sea: Walke may you sometimes vnder Pompeus shade, To PhÅbus pallace to the place was made: For nouall triumph to the Memphian fawne To the goatfield where chariots are still drawne. To the warme bleeding alter, some preferrs, Before all these the three braue Theaters: Thus couet to be seen, vnseen, vnproud, What is not viewed and knowne, cannot be lou'd, What profit were it to haue beautious been: If thy admired face were neuer seen: Say you more stilde in shapes then Orpheus were, Or Thamiras, such if men cannot heare. How should your musicke please; Apelles painted, Venus in Cois else her fame had fainted, The dignitie of Poets. And died in Lethe, he redeem'd her name, What hunt the sacred Poets for but fame. Onely for fame their labouring spirits they send, Of all the vowes, fame is the scope and end But see what alterations rude times brings, Poets of old were the right hand of Kings. Large were their gifts, supreame was their regard, Their meeted fames with fear and reuerence heard Honour and state: and sacred maiesty, Belong'd to such as studied poetry: Emnus by Scipio that great man was sought, And from the mountaines of Calabria brought. Vnhonoured how the Iuy garland Iyes: The ancient worship done to Poets dyes: Yet we should striue our owne fames to awake. Homer a liuing lasting worke did make: His Iliadis call'd, else who had Homer knowne, Had Danas in her tower an old wife growne, And neuer vnto publicke view resorted, How had her beauty being so farre reported: You that applause would for your beauties win Be oft abroad, and keepe not too much in: At the full folds the she Wolfe seekes her pray, Though amongst all she steales but one away, Ioues bird the Eagle when she soares most high, To seaze on fowle doth at the Couy fly. Frequent you faire ones, where men may you see Mongst many one best part will fancy thee: In euery place where thou shalt hap to sit, Loose none by frownes whom thou by smiles maist gein, The bow of Cupid neuer stands vnbent, And oftentimes things fall by accedent. Be thou prepard, hang alwayes out thy hooke; For in that stream where thou no fish wouldst look A fish by chance may bite, oft haue I seene The wandring hound range where no game hath beene And harts that scaps the chase wh? no m? mids them, Fall in the toyles and there the keeper findes them What hope hadst thou Andromeda being bound, Vnto a rocke a louer to haue found: Being prepar'd for death beset with feares, Blubbed thy cheeks, thy eye quite drownd in teares At buriall of one husband well I wot, Another husband hath been oft times got, Weeping for him thats lost, may hap to grace thee, And in the bosome of a second place thee, But in your choyse especially beware, Of such effiminate men as starch their haire. Prank vp themselues who lispe and cannot leaue [illeg.] Loue complement and use to smell of Ciuit: They haue a thousand loues what they protest, To thee theyll do as vnto all the rest, Unstaid such be, and what will women say, When in their thoughts men are more light then they Scarce will they credit me, and yet tis true, Troy had yet stood, and Illium beene in view, Had euery thing beene swaid as Priam spake, But good aduise they leaue, fond counsell take. There are who vnder shew of loue to fame, Louers disloyalty in many. Seuerall passages. And by such passage seeke dishonest gaine: Let no mans haire deceiue with powders sweete, Nor studded girles which are short and meete: Nor these fine womens coates, a sightly thing, Nor that each finger beares a golden ring. Perhaps who in this kinde most gallant goes, Is a close theefe, and loues nought but your clothes Som Maids thus roab'd, so loud cry for their owne That all the towne and country heares their mone Venus whose golden shines at Apian stand, And Pallas laugh a good these strifes in hand: There are some Maides to sure but of bad same, Who oft deceiu'd are thought to vse the same. On learne by others plaints to heare your owne, Ope not your ears to men whose frauds are known Beleeue not Theseus Athens though he sweare, The gods can heare no more then they heare. And thou Demop[illeg.]oon Theseus falshood haire: Philis deceiued nones trust by speeches faire, If men makes promises then maides make you. If men performe, performe your vowed ioyes too, Now Ile come nearer, Muse, take faster hold. Nor loose thy seat the wheels though swiftly rold: Men frame them, set maids vowes some else where writ Let som maids take their course, for it were fit. Look on them, read them, fr? the words then gather Whether he faines or [illeg.]ues intirely rather: After some while write backe euer delayes: Inflames a louer; so no tedious stayes. Shew not the plaint, to the youth denies. Nor yet denie him what by suite he plies Let him both feare and hope by euerie letter, Be his fearelesse, his hope comes sure and better. Be your phrase pure, but common vsuall words, In speech the plainest stile best grace affords: Full oft ambigious words loue so misplace. And a foule tongue hath hurt a beautious face: But since although you yet not married be, To go beyond vs men that care take ye. By maides or some knowne lad your letters send. And to no strange young man tokens commend. I haue seene some maides so terrifide with this, That euer after they were slaues I wisse, Faithlesse he is who keepes such tokens backe. And burns like Ãtna till he ope the packe Trust me, we may with fraud quite fraud againe, From force to shield, from force the laws maintaine One maide must vse her selfe to many hands Ill might he speed whose shifts this rule commands Deface the old seale when you do reply, And to one writing but one hand apply. Subscribe your letters thus, thine in all loue, Impedimento to beautie. Anger.Be his, as he was yours, this art approue, If from small things we may to greater go, And in our ship spread our full saile to show. It longs to beauty to haue manners milde, Sweet pace fits women, fierce rage sauage wilde. Rage swels the face, the vaines makes blacke with blood The eies blase ghastly like sell Gorgons brood Away quoth she I prize not feature so, Pallas should view her face, where waters flow: And should you looke your anger in your glasse, You wold scarce discerne your visage whose it was. Nor do we lesse blame proud and loftie lookes Pride. Gentle and humble eies are Cupids hookes, We men do hate this ouer-weening pride, Shew in the silent face, trust him hath tride. View him views you, if men then women smile, Signes made to you, make signes, 'twill men beguile Thus whiles he playes before with headles dart, Cupid hath after wounded to the heart. We hate men said Aiax, Tremessa take, We merrie Greeks blith wenches sweetharts make: Andromache Tremessa all your state, Could not moue me to chuse you for my mate, Take gifts of rich men who do law professe. Giue him no fee, be his client, need the lesse: We that make verse, let us send onely verse Our hearts are pliant, whose loue soon doth pierce We spread abroad sweet beautie lasting praise Poets. We Nemesis, we Cim[illeg.]heas honour raise: The East and West land knew lou'd Licoris, And many aske who our Cormina is. Besides we Poets from all frauds are free, And forward manners by our Poetrie. Nor honour vs, nor loue of money please, We slight our games for priuacie and ease, Soone are we caught, our loues burn fierce &amp; bold And where we loue we know to well to hold, So 'tis we soften nature by meeke art. And as our studies, so our loues take part: A fauour Maidens, a blest Poets will, Heauens power we haue, the Muses owne vs still. A God is in us we commerce with Ioue. The spirit in vs boue your bright stars doth moue: To looke for money from vs what a crime, And yet no Maides do feare it in our time. At first be not too eager, faine beware, A nouice louer slights an open snare: Nor do we rule a horse new broke to backe. With the same raines as he that's skild to racke: To catch one staid in yeares, and a briske swaine, Must not one way, may not one course be [illeg.]aine: Hee's rude, and in loues tents nere seene before, Who as a new pray touch'd thy chamber doore. Who knows no Maid but thee, non else wold know This corn would be highfenced that it may grow: If one, he is thy owne, no riualls frowne, Two things admits no mate, Loue and a Crowne. That ancient souldiers wife and softly loue, And much that younger scorns he meekly proues: He'll breake no posts, nor burne with furious fire, Nor scratch his mistris soft cheeks in his ire, He'll teare no clothes, his Loues nor his owne, Nor shall his torne haire giue him cause of mone: These things fits youthes, whose loue as age is hot, This beares harsh wounds gently as they were not: Old men burne softly like a torch that's drie, As woods from heath out downe when first they lie Old mens loue sure, youth short, but fruitfull made Maides pluck those fruites betimes, betimes which fade, May yeeld vp all, ope the gates to our foe. That faith from faithlesse treasure once may flow: What's easie granted, long loue cannot feede, (Deniall seeth) our sports must oft proceede: Let them walke at the gate cry cruell dore, Do humbly much, but in their threats much more, We loath these sweets, bitter loue makes them new, The winde oft drown'd the ship by which it flew; Tis this makes men their wines to slight so full, They are ready prest when are their husbands will. Let the Maide run and cry we are vndone, And hide the sacred youth till feare be gone Yet sport him midst these feares lest he misprise, Your night's nor so much worth such feares should rise I had like to passe by what art to deceiue. To deceiue the most watchfull keeper. Your husband and sly keeper to bereaue Wiues feare your husbands, who must keepe you in 'Tis firme by law right modestie hath bin. Her to be kept whom late reuenge hath wrought, Who can endure to avoid these meanes be sought: As many keepe thee as had Argos eyes, If thou wilt out thou shalt defeate with lyes Youll say your keeper doth withstand to write, Take water for your selfe what time you might, What can the keeper when the Cities fill, Of plaies and Maides see horses run that will. When she will, a maide complaines her head, And faining sicke, hides home she will in bed: When the false key tells plainelie what is done, And to her chamber are more waies then one. Besides a keeper may be foxt with wine, Prest from the grapes of Spaine, and so made thine And there be drugs, which can cause a sound sleep, And shut the eies fast drencht in Lethe deepe, You know Maides to May quicklie finde some way By long made sports to hold him in delay. But what need I for to go farre about, When one small gift may buie the keeper out, Gifts trust me do appease both gods and men, By gifts euen Ioue is pleased now and then. What do the wise since fooles in gifts delight, Giue, and the husband sayes nought, say he might. Hast bought thy keeper once hes thine for euer. The helpe he once affords heele faile thee neuer. I blam'd companions now it comes to minde, The hurt by it not men alone do finde. Beleeue me, other Maides thy ioyes may taste, And others with thee hunt the Hare as fast, The wench that sweepes the ch?ber makes the bed With sports of loue hath more then once bin sped Let not your waiting Maides be ouer faire, Their Mistris place by them supplyed are. Where run I Madman, naked against my foe, And ope those ports that may me ouerthrow: The birds teach not the Fowler how to take them, The Harts teach not the dogs to run &amp; shake them, Looke too't that need my taske Ile do indeed, Though 'tis to lend a sword to make me bleed: 'Tis easie to make vs think we are beloued, Their faith which to desire is quickly moued: Smile louely on a youth, sigh from your hart. Aske why he comes so late, a pretty art. Shed some few tears, faine grief for some close loue, And teare your haire as doth your passions moue. He is ouercome straite, pitty he will take, And say his care is onely for my sake: If he be spruce, and looke faire in the glasse He'll thinke the gods loue him, let not this passe Who ere thou art be not thy worth so strong Nor rage not ouer much, hath he done wrong? The hysterie of Procris.Trust not too soone what art is in this case, Procris may be example haue you grace, Neare to Hymetus hill a holy well, The description of Hymetus.And a moist ground thick grast the ancients tell: The wood, but vnderwood about this land, The Crab tree, Rosemarie, Bay, Mir[illeg.]le stand. The thicke leau'd boxe, the Tamariske so small, Low shrubs, neat Pines, ther do these trees grew all The gentle West wind and the healthfull aire, Blow all those leaues &amp; grasblads which are there: Cephalus loued rest, his hounds and men forgone, Weary in youth this ground oft sat vpon And thus he sings, thou which dost lay my heat, Age, my breast come gentle aire and beat. One ouer dutious told his fearfull wife, These words she heard, and so began the strife: Procris who for a strumpet tooke his care, Fell downe much moued with a suddaine feare. Looke how the vineleafe which you latest gather, She lookt so pale, or far more paler rather: And the ripe Quine-tree which doth bend his bows Or dog-tree fruite, which none for meate allowes. Come to her selfe, her garments quite she tore, From of her breast, and made her breast all gore, And without stay in rage and hast she goes, Her haire about her necke like Bacchus froes: Being near the place, her mate she leaues behind, Steals slily to the wood no feare in mind. Tis thus thou thinkest now, who this aire should be And her dishonest tricks thine eie shall see: Her coming shames her now, she would not take her Yet now she's glad she's come, loue doubtfull makes The name, the place, the signe all these agree, And what the mind fears, that it thinks to be, Seeing the grasse so by some body prest. Her trembling heart knockt at her tender breast: Now the Mid-day had made the shadowes short, The euening and the morne of equall port: Young Cephalus returns vnto the wood And cooles his face with water as he stood. Procris stands close, on the grasse he laies him fair, And cries aloud, blow west winde, come sweet aire So soone as she had heard the eronious name, Her mind and her true colour to her came, She rises, with her body the leaues shake, In mind to Cephalus her way to take: He thought it some wilde beast, snatch vp his bow, His arrow in his right hand wont to show. What dost thou wretch, 'tis no beast, stay thy dart. Alas, thy arrows pierce a womans heart: She cryes out, thou hast stroke thy louing breast, Vpon this place thy wounds haue euer rest. I dye before my time, not wrong'd in loue, This earth made me suspect thee light to proue, Aire take my breath, thee 'twas I did mistrust, I dye, close thou my eyes, lay me in the dust. She ended speech and life, and falling down, Her husband takes her last breath from the ground, He beares his dying loue in wofull armes, And wailes with tears so strange and deadly harms, But let vs backe, I see I must be plaine, At the lost hauen that our ship may againe, You looke now to be brought vnto a feast. And that we teach you here as in the rest: Come late, but comely brought in by night. Thou shalt be welcome so delay hath might. Though thou be blacke thou shalt seeme fair to all The night will hide thy faults both great and small: How maides must behaue themselues at meate.Eate neately with your fingers art commands, Wipe not thy whole face with thy dirty hands. Eat not to long, leaue ere you would forbeare, More then thou well canst do, this counsell heare: Were Hellen greedy Paris would her hate: And say my rape is foolish out of date, To drinke is comely: and more fit for you, Bacchus doth well with Venus this is true, Drinke, but yet not more then you well can beare And what is one, let it not to appeare: A shamefull thing to see a woman drunke, Such a one is fit to be each base knaues punke. Nor is it safe to sleep the tables drawne, Much shamfull things haue in your sleep bin sawne 'Tis shame to teach you more, yet Diou sayes, Shame is the chiefest abiect of these layes Each know your selues as you your bodies see, So frame your lying in form that it may be. Gestures in lying. Whose face is beauteous she must lye vpright, Whose backe is best that still must be in sight: Atlantues thighes vpon his shoulders wore, Meuation be these best, shew thee the more. Low Maides must ride, Thehais was somewhat long Nere sate on Hectors horse her pride among, Who hath a long side, which shed haue in eye, Let her bend to her knees her necke awry: Whose hidden parts haue not a fault or spot, Lye euer sidelong pray forget it not. Nor thinke it a disgrace your haire to loose, And then thy necke cast backeward still to choose Thou that art ragged close and couered lye. And from mens sight like the swift Parthian fly: Loue hath a thousand wayes most void of pride, To lie halfe vpright on the higher side, Apollos, Tripos, nor horrid Ammon say, Nor things more true then whatare in our lay: If there be truth in art got by long vse, Beleeue and trust, you'll finde it in our muse. Maides see you loue vs men, plucke from the root, One thing may help you and steed to boot: Cease not faire words cease not close whispering sweet And wanton words must with your sports of meet. And thou wh? nature hath bard loues quick sence Faine pleasant ioies though the things be from thence: Vnhappy Maide to whom that place is dull, Which with a man and woman should be full. Yet when you faine, beware, let none else know it, For feare thy gesture or thy eies may shew it: What helpes the speech and shewes the breath is ill That part hath secrets, shame would hide it still, Who seekes a man after enioyment straight, Louing a gift would not her prayers had weight: Ope not your windowes wide to take in light, Much in your bodies rather fits the night, Conclusion of the workOur sport is done, 'tis time the swaines depart, Which on their necks as yoaks haue drawn our art As Men before, say Maides, when ye preuaile, Ouid our master was, his hart our saile.
