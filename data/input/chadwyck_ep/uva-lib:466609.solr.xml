      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I “Per desio di Lode Non canto io, no; ben per chi m'ama e m'ode.” Vittoria Colonna. TO MY FRIENDS. GONZALVO OF CORDOVA, A ROMANCE DRAMATIZED. This first attempt at dramatic composition was made in the year 1810, without any previous study or reflection. The subject was taken by mere accident; yet on revising the piece after so many years, I am struck with the situation of the hero as one capable of great interest in more able hands. I am aware how little the Gonzalvo of the drama is the “great captain” of history, but I must plead in my excuse, that I took him from Mons. de Florian's novel. I beg the indulgence of my friends for the weakness which induces me to retain a sort of dedication, in the form of a sonnet, to my late aunt, Mrs. Ogle. Many of those whom I address remember her piety, her goodness, her touching animation, and even youthful cheerfulness in extreme old age, under great infirmity, and after thirty years of total blindness: these will not wonder that the recollection of her having shed tears over this poem should give it a value in my eyes of which I feel unwilling to divest it. The Hoo, April 25, 1821. TO MY AUNT, WITH A COPY OF GONZALVO OF CORDOVA. Although Time's heavy hand thy form may bow, And leaving Earth's low cares, be fix'd on high Thy graver thought, youth's every energy Forgets not in thy boundless heart to glow: Those orbs that Heaven's gay light no longer know, Nor meet with kindred beam affection's eye, (Long, long denied each grateful ministry), Still own the tear that flows for others' woe; Nor flows o'er sad reality alone: Ev'n for the fabled ill the Muse portrays The sacred drop upon thy cheek has shone. Be thine the lay so graced, and so endeared! Thou, as the sainted author of my days, Alike from earliest years beloved, revered! Hampton Court Palace, January 27th, 1812. GONZALVO OF CORDOBA. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. SPANIARDS. Ferdinand, king of Aragon. Gonzalvo of Cordova, prince of Venusa. Lara, his friend. Pedro, his servant. Garcia, Alvarez, and other Spanish nobles. Isabella, queen of Castile, married to Ferdinand. Ladies of her train, &amp;c.MOORS. Muley Hassan, late king of Granada, having abdicated his throne in favour of Abdoulah, his eldest son. Almanzor, his youngest son, leader of the Moors. Omar, Selim, and other Moors. Zelima, daughter of Muley Hassan. Moorish damsels of her train. Chorus of Moors, Messengers, &amp;c. The SCENE lies in and near Granada. ACT I. SCENE I. A Wood. Moors employed in preparing tents or pavilions for the Princess. A distant view of Granada, and on the further hills the Spanish camp.—Omar and Selim employed in the front of the stage. OMAR. After our long day's travel, here, my friends, The princess wills we rest us for the night. Spread her pavilion; for beneath this shade She will await her royal father's coming. SELIM. The good old king! and shall he thus receive His rescued daughter from the stranger's hand? 'Mong woodland wilds!—not on Granada's throne? OMAR. Peace! 'twas to stay the civil strife he placed The diadem on King Abdoulah's brow. SELIM. True! for we thought a younger king, forsooth, Should lead us forth to certain victory— Mistaken men!— OMAR. But only in the chief Should lead us forth, for victory is ours Since Prince Almanzor leads Granada's forces, And since the hero of Castile, Gonzalvo, In Africa is stay'd by Seïd's arts. Assist thou our companions. I will seek The Princess Zelima: on yonder height She waits th' approach of royal Muley Hassan. SELIM (significantly). And by her side, I ween, the gallant stranger. OMAR. Ev'n so.—But from his follower I learn The noble youth now purposes departure, Resigning to a father's care his charge. 'Tis pity, Selim, they should e'er be sever'd; And sure the man who singly rescued her Might claim her favour. SELIM. Nay, I will be sworn, Brave though he be, of courtesy unmatch'd, He is not nobly born: else why conceal His name and lineage? OMAR. Peace, Selim, peace! the noble stranger comes— Assist thou yonder—We but lose the hour. [Selim goes back to assist, and exit Omar. Enter Gonzalvo and Pedro, in Moorish habits. PEDRO. Why thus disturb'd, my lord?—Beware, beware, That you betray not 'tis Gonzalvo's brow Conceal'd beneath that turban's folds!—Your arms, The terror of the Moor, the Spaniard's boast, Brought by a faithful hand at evening's close, Will wake your soul to war and victory! To-morrow! and Gonzalvo is himself! GONZALVO. Oh Pedro! Pedro! never wilt thou see Gonzalvo bear himself as he was wont. PEDRO. Rouse you, my lord, to meet your sov'reign's favour: The gracious Isabel your coming waits With Ferdinand, her spouse. Attain'd the object Of your high embassy, and thus escaped From Seïd's snares, oh! judge with what full joy! Brave Lara, too, your earliest, dearest friend, Your glory's partner— GONZALVO (with momentary joy). To-morrow I shall grasp My Lara's glowing hand!—But oh! I shrink From friendship's searching eye. PEDRO. What says my lord? GONZALVO. Pedro, this fatal habit has unmann'd me. PEDRO. This Moorish garb, my lord, has done you service: Beneath it you escaped from Afric's coast, Although beset by Seïd's base assassins, And on this hostile shore, possess'd by Moors, It lull'd suspicion:—throw it off with thanks. GONZALVO. Oh! that Gonzalvo ne'er had stoop'd to wear This base disguise! then Zelima had known Her country's foe, and honour had withheld Her gentle hands that medicined my wounds; And the sweet accents, far more powerful, That bade me live—bade her preserver live! PEDRO. Behold! she leads her royal father on.— Avoid her eye, she must not see you thus. [Exeunt. Zelima appears among the trees, conducting Muley Hassan, Almanzor, and train. They advance with expressions of joy and affection. MULEY HASSAN. My child! my child! beyond all hope restored! What joy to clasp thee thus! and can it be Gladness once more should visit my sad age? Oh! what is loss of empire to me now? Thou art my all! [He embraces Zelima, and appears overcome. ZELIMA. My father! my dear father! [Turning to Almanzor. My brother too! my ever loved Almanzor! [They embrace. And do I hold thee to my heart again? Avenger of Granada's injured realm! How sweet to hear thy name through all the land, Lisp'd even by babes, as guardian of their home! ALMANZOR. And this blest day will doubly nerve my arm, Which the sad loss of thee had half unstrung. ZELIMA (returning to her father). My father, you look pale and worn with sorrow! Was it the loss of your poor Zelima? Oh yes, it was!—But I am yours again, Thanks to the generous stranger, of whose deeds My messengers gave something to your ear. But—no—it was not for their tongues to tell, How, rushing on the Ethiopian ruffians, Who bore me shrieking to the sea-beat shore, As though his hand had grasp'd the thunderer's bolt, He dealt destruction! How, with desperate strength, Though bleeding, cover'd o'er with wounds himself, He bore me—nobly bore me—till he sunk, O'erspent with toil, and weltering in his gore. MULEY HASSAN. May Heaven reward his valour!—Where is he? ZELIMA. Haste, Selim, and entreat the stranger's presence. [Exit Selim. ALMANZOR. Say, since he rescued thee, my Zelima, How hast thou fared? ZELIMA. Trust me, most royally. Soon as the thronging multitudes had learnt My high condition, and my piteous tale, I was provided by their humble duty With all things both for service and delight. The stranger's wounds, so grievous, ask'd the 'tendance Of gentlest skill; and happy! oh, thrice happy! These hands unwearied minister'd relief, Until restored to health, my brave preserver Might safe conduct me to my father's arms! And let thy fancy picture, my Almanzor, A simple people's love, devising ever Honours uncouth, but prompted by the heart, To grace the generous stranger as he pass'd. My travel through the realm has been as 'twere A fair delightful vision, and the waking, Oh! 'tis more joyous still! Enter Gonzalvo—Zelima meets him eagerly and joyfully. ZELIMA. Say why, my friend, Breaking so sudden from my side, you shun To witness happiness yourself dispense? MULEY HASSAN (to ALMANZOR). This joy tumultuous pains my aged breast. [Zelima presents Gonzalvo to her father. Words are but poor to speak a father's thanks, And as a father only can I thank thee. Were I a monarch still, brave youth, I might In some sort prove my heart's deep gratitude, But beggar'd as I am, my prayers and blessings Are all I can return. GONZALVO (embarrassed). Spare me, good king; Bred in the tented field, I am unused To gentle words like these. MULEY HASSAN. Give me thy hand! Let these tears speak. GONZALVO. Oh! never—never yet Has such a tear as thine been shed for me; The widow's and the orphan's tears are those My deeds have caused to flow. ZELIMA (tenderly). Nay, say not so! ALMANZOR. Your arm, brave youth, has won us to your love: I thank you, as a soldier thanks a soldier, And hope, when, fellows in the field, we strive With the insulting foe who threats Granada, By open deeds my pleasing debt to quit. Forgive me, sir, that yet I know not how To name the stranger, whom henceforth I hold Brother in arms, t'avenge Granada's wrongs. GONZALVO. Prince, I am one mark'd in so strange a sort By Fortune's hand—(happy alone in that My favour'd sword has done your sister service), That my distemper'd mind, at war within, Sees evil in each good men value most. My name in Fame's proud record is enroll'd, Yet would I fain erase it from her page; Forgive me, then, if I pronounce it not. ZELIMA (who has been talking apart with her father). Oh! my loved father, you are too much moved. Come and repose beneath yon canopy, There will I paint to you my dangers past; It will be grateful to retrace them now— Your happy daughter will support your steps. [She leads her father to the Pavilion, looking back at Gonzalvo, who watches her as if lost in admiration. ALMANZOR (observing them). Ha! that soft interchange of mutual looks! [He follows slowly, looking with keen suspicious glances at Gonzalvo. GONZALVO (alone). How my soul sickens to dissemble thus! To bear myself as midnight murderers use, To hang the head, and stammer some quaint phrase, Obscure and vague, not gender'd in the heart: Detested fraud! Oh! one must love as I do, And be, like me, just object of the hate Of her he loves, expect her utter scorn If he throw off this serpent's slough, and yet Disdain to wear it from his very soul As I do, but to guess at what I feel. Enter Omar, from the Pavilion. OMAR. Brave youth, the king requests some conference. GONZALVO. I obey. [Follows to the Pavilion, from whence Almanzor and Zelima advance. ALMANZOR (aside). Ha! why are we dismiss'd? and why alone Would our good father entertain the stranger? I like it not. ZELIMA. How sweet the evening airs! Almanzor, while they fan thy war-worn brow, I will recount the noble stranger's deeds. ALMANZOR (sarcastically). My Zelima, methinks the pleasing theme Wearies thee not. ZELIMA. And can the pleasing theme Of benefits received be wearisome? Brother, your heart was wont to beat in unison With mine. ALMANZOR (kindly). And ever will!—but now, my sister, I must away; for in such haste I flew, When first the happy tidings reach'd my ear That thou wert safe, I, heedless, gave no thought To matters of high import.—Ere we part, Declare, who is this youth to whom you owe Your honour and your life, and in whose praise You are so eloquent?—There is a something My spirit brooks not in this stranger's bearing: Noble his air, right haughty too, and yet Faltering his speech. ZELIMA. He may be languid still, Newly restored from wounds received for me. ALMANZOR. But why that air of woe? ZELIMA. Alas! I know not; Some sorrow sure had labour'd in his breast Ere I beheld him; yet I mark'd it not Till hitherward we journey'd day by day, And as each evening closed, methought his grief Had ta'en a deeper hold. It was not so, With looks averted, he was wont to speak, His brow was open as th' expanse of heaven, Candour and truth sat ever on his lips. ALMANZOR. Hold, Zelima! this truth, this candour—where Were they when you sought to know his name? ZELIMA (embarrassed). He still besought me—spare him sad remembrance Of what he would forget—I knew his deeds! The name of one who had so nobly wrought Could nothing add to my strong gratitude. ALMANZOR (after musing). Sister, I think he to your hand aspires. Nay, blush not thus. Yes, this dissembler does. For that he rescued thee, I freely thank him; Yet who had worn a sword and had not done it? His birth, his name unknown—I will not think Thou couldst so much forget what thou wert born As brook the suit of such a wanderer. ZELIMA. Nay, wrong him not, Almanzor, by these thoughts. He has not breathed a vow I might not hear, Nor will he, till his deeds proclaim his birth, And blazon forth that name he has conceal'd. ALMANZOR. I will believe thee—Pardon thou, my sister, A brother's jealous fears. Granada's fate Sits heavy at my heart. Abdoulah, lost In the soft slothful luxuries of empire, Disgraces much our father's yielded sceptre— I must away—inquire not wherefore. ZELIMA. Nay, Thou shalt not break discourteous thus away From our loved father's presence.—Yonder see A faithful peasant train to hail our joys! Come, lead them on; their rustic courtesy Will smooth thy careful brow—Refuse me not. [She leads him out gaily. Re-enter Muley Hassan with Gonzalvo. MULEY HASSAN. Youth, I have read thy heart, and joy to find My daughter's image there. Nay, start not thus. Yes, friend, the varying brow, the deep-drawn sigh, The quick emotions flushing on thy cheek, Are nature's language, and not strange to me. I, too, have known how 'tis that young hearts feel, Nor have forgot how dear I held her mother. Haste, then, brave youth, and win my daughter's hand On yonder plain—Relieve besieged Granada, And Zelima is thine. GONZALVO (aside). My tortured soul! Good reverend king! you know not what you say. While thus you speak heaven opens to my view, Then sudden closes with a tenfold gloom. That I do love and honour your fair daughter I will confess; but spare me, spare me, king, The agony to think I may not hope. MULEY HASSAN. Thou art too modest, youth; thy worth and valour Are not so lost on Zelima. Zelima and Almanzor enter with a train of peasants, bearing fruits, &amp;c. ZELIMA. My father, Behold the offerings of simple duty Court your acceptance. [The peasants present their offerings. Oh! you know not half The joy that fills this bosom! [Observing Gonzalvo's emotion, while her father is employed in expressions of gracious acceptance towards the peasants. Why, my friend, Art thou disturb'd?—If I might see thee smile, Nothing on earth were blest as Zelima. GONZALVO. Yes, at thy bidding I would veil with smiles Thoughts fraught with nameless bitterness—but no, It will not be—Give all thy gentle soul To innocent joy, and heed me not. ALMANZOR (observing them, aside). Again Those earnest looks! again those tender tones! MULEY HASSAN (to the peasants). Thanks! thanks, my friends! (To Zelima and Almanzor). My children! Oh, how sweet Affection's tribute, howe'er rude and humble! Trust me, no feast in gorgeous vessels served, With all the pomp of the Alhambra palace, While yet I fill'd the throne, was half so grateful As this repast of simple fruits, thus shared In full confiding love. Enter a Messenger. Good Muley Hassan, And Prince Almanzor, thou our matchless chief! 'Tis meet ye know that through Granada's host Strange consternation spreads, for that 'tis rumour'd, Escaped from Afric, to the Spanish camp Gonzalvo, styled of Cordova, returns. [All start with terror: Zelima presses closer to her father, as if for protection. Gonzalvo, apart, betrays contending passions. ALMANZOR. Shall consternation seize our host for this? Shame on the dastard slaves! Have they forgot Almanzor leads them? Have I led them on Often to victory, never to defeat, And shall they—dare they doubt me? Go, Tell them their leader pledges here his faith To rid them of their terror—Yes, to-morrow Shall their Almanzor fall in single combat, Or he shall bite the dust, my glory's rival, Proud Spain's Gonzalvo! GONZALVO (starting from his reverie, and laying his hand on his sword). Does the Moor Almanzor Thus rush on certain fate? ALMANZOR (with contempt). “On certain fate!” Haply to thee 'twere so. GONZALVO (trembling with indignation, his hand onhis sword). Insulting Moor! ZELIMA (seizing his arm, and looking earnestly in his face). Why, why that terrible brow? that sword why grasp'd? [He looks tenderly at her, and drops his hand. Was it to save the wretched Zelima Once more in her Almanzor?—Yes, 'twas so! [To her father, with exultation. Oh, trust these eyes, my father, that beheld The prodigies of valour which redeem'd Your Zelima, if this brave youth go forth Unmatch'd no longer vaunts the dread Gonzalvo. ALMANZOR (with irony and disdain). Haply this arm is palsied! so, it seems, A sister would infer. As for yon stranger, Yon fortunate unknown, whose maiden sword Has done some service to Granada's princess, I marvel not his new-blown valour suddenly Aspires to deeds in arms, of other sort Than to chastise the Ethiop ravisher. MULEY HASSAN. My son, repress thy ardour, and attend A father's counsel. ALMANZOR. Lend me rather, sir, A patient hearing, and I will unfold Reasons of state.—Apart from these were best. [Exeunt Almanzor and Muley Hassan. GONZALVO (aside). For what am I reserved? [Seeing Zelima still looking fearfully and wistfully in his face. Fear nothing, princess! For this poor arm were nerveless as a child's To wreak my wrongs on one who is thy brother. [After a pause, with assumed firmness. My dream of bliss is o'er—I must away, Imperious duty calls; but ere I go For ever from thy sight—Oh yes, for ever— (For so thyself thou wilt pronounce my doom) Allow me in yon grove to say farewell, A last farewell to thee and happiness! [Breaks from her in an agony, and leaves her thunderstruck. ZELIMA (alone). For ever, said he?—What! for ever part? A chilling horror creeps o'er all my frame. How happy! Oh how happy have I been! Alas! what made me so I cannot tell, Nor why I feel so wretched on the sudden. Was it that freed from cumbrous dignity I roam'd at large, restored to simple nature? Saw the sun rise, and heard the early birds, Breathed the pure morning airs o'er hill and dale, And quite forgot I was a wretched princess? Or was it (I tremble but to think 'twas so), That with the dawn I saw the stranger youth, Enjoy'd with him the early choristers, With him the morning gale!—Alas, for me! How could I hope it should be ever thus? Well might I sure have thought that one so brave Would to the field of fame, nor think of me. Did he not ask to speak a last farewell? Yes—I will seek him ere the evening close, And say—if so I can—farewell for ever! ACT II. SCENE I. Royal Tent in the Spanish Camp. Enter Ferdinand, Isabella, and Suite. FERDINAND. True, Isabel; when I received advices That thy Gonzalvo had escaped the snares Of treacherous Seïd, I gave forth to all, That he, ere many suns should set, would join The glorious strife as he was wont. Methinks Thy hero slackens in our cause, or else Why this delay? ISABELLA. We know not yet how many Disastrous chances may beset his way. Thou dost not love the flower of my heroes, For that he still has borne the palm away From those of Aragon. Yet, Ferdinand, Since he who conquer'd Cordova no longer Flames in the van of battle, the proud Moor Has borne himself right vauntingly; nay, oft With such true mettle, that our knights of name Are dash'd and crest-fall'n. Of sicklier hue The soldier's ardor. FERDINAND. Isabel, thou wrong'st me. Would he were here, so he might woo again The truant Victory to smile on us! Enter Lara. Welcome, brave Lara! Ha! methinks thy mien Bespeaks some joyful tidings. LARA. Yes, my liege, And gracious queen! These letters, from good Pedro, Announce Gonzalvo's coming. A faithful Moor (I know not how won to his service), bore them, And now conveys his arms, and gallant steed, To meet th' impatient chief. ISABELLA. Oh! doubly welcome, For all the dangers past! How 'scaped he, Lara? LARA. He and his faithful Pedro, clad as Moors, In a frail fisher's boat put forth by night, And purposed, when at open sea, to join The ships that bore his train; but, tempest-tost, The crazy, unresisting bark was drifted Towards the Moorish coast of Spain, where courteously They were as Africans received, and shared The liberal rights of hospitality. FERDINAND. The moon has fill'd her horns and waned again Since he escaped, as our advices stated. LARA. A grievous sickness seized him, good my liege: And Pedro further adds, his lord not yet Has gain'd his wonted cheer. FERDINAND. The Moors are soft, And they have dark-eyed maids, with wily speech. Methinks thy friend has loiter'd on his way, Till, haply, Moorish hospitality Has won his soul from glory's love; and yet The infatuated soldier, if he lead, Will rush, as 'twere, enamour'd ev'n of death, When met beneath his eye. LARA. My liege, what praise So great as that which from thy lips has fall'n, Though in contempt? The leader who is loved, Beneath whose eye 'tis glory but to fight, And deathless fame to fall, whate'er th' event, Leads on to what a soldier covets—honour! Nay Fortune, fickle Fortune, will forego Her very nature; and, as 'twere, spell-bound, Wait on his charmed sword. FERDINAND. Thou pleadest well, And art an honest, and an eager friend. Nay, 'twas but our impatience, Isabel, (To Isabella. That chid Gonzalvo's stay. When may we hope To speak a joyous welcome? LARA. Ere the close Of evening I dare swear he will appear, And by his wonted bearing, put to flight The half form'd doubts that cloud the royal brow. Enter Messenger. MESSENGER. My liege, our outposts near the city walls Have mark'd advancing heralds, with the wand That speaks their office. FERDINAND. Ha! What may it be? We will receive them as befits our state. Come in, my queen: let all things be prepared. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Wood. Gonzalvo leaning against a tree, lost in thought. Zelima enters timidly; he starts, and meets her with rapture. ZELIMA. I come, my friend, since thou wilt have it so, To speak a long, thou say'st a last, farewell; Yet I had hoped—believed—my father's claims— For Muley Hassan loves thee— GONZALVO. Oh! my princess! Might I obtain my wildest dream of bliss, It were no other than to share with thee Each filial care; but I should violate The sacred ties of nature and of honour— Nature's, that binds us to our country; honour's, That binds us to the cause we have espoused. ZELIMA. Mysterious stranger! say, what tie of nature, Or of capricious honour, can forbid That you should cheer, when battle gives short respite, The tedious hours of age? and must I never Behold thee more? nor know whose valour saved me? GONZALVO. Alas! methinks I oft have said enough To lead thy shuddering fancy to portray The hated thing I am. ZELIMA. No, never, youth! If e'er I sought to know your name, your race, Your colour alter'd, and some strange distress Hung on your brow, and changed your wonted cheer: Deeply your debtor, silent I respected Your secret sorrow; but my father now Approves my gratitude, and bids me think Of you as one—of whom then must I think, As now my father wills? GONZALVO. Yes, thou shalt know The wretch I am! but say, sweet excellence! Say, would'st thou spurn him thou hast call'd thy friend, If, strange to fame, a lowly peasant born, He were the basest thing that bears a name? ZELIMA. I smile, brave stranger, while you talk thus idly. Can he be base whose actions are so noble, Rear'd though he were beneath the humblest roof? GONZALVO. But if I were perfidious, false; had practised On the unguarded goodness of an angel; By vilest fraud had won her confidence, Her fair esteem—though mine the world's wide empire, Wouldst thou not scorn me? ZELIMA. No, not such thy deeds! For if thou glance at hapless Zelima, Thou never, never hast in aught deceived her. Was it deceit, from a most cruel death, Or worse than death, to save her at the price Of thy own generous blood? To honour her (A poor, deserted, helpless wanderer), And guide her to her father and her home? These deeds are honest: for these deeds I thank thee, Nor ever will they fade from my remembrance. GONZALVO. How shall I e'er deserve this angel goodness? Yet do I tremble, and my faltering tongue Refuses still to name the wretch accursed, Call'd by the Fates to lift his murderous sword Against thy brother. ZELIMA (with horror). Gods! the dread Gonzalvo! Granada's ruthless foe! [After a pause recovering, yet fearfully. Oh, no; you mock My woman's weak credulity. Why—why Should I thus tremble? Friend, this is not kind! 'Tis now you practise on th' unguarded heart. Away, vain terror! no, it is not so! Is this the look the fierce Gonzalvo wears? His looks must speak his cruel soul! his deeds Are all of blood! He is not wont, like thee, To rescue innocence; to watch, nay, weep [Observing his emotion. O'er the unfortunate! Sure some jealous fear, Or thought injurious to my faith, has led thee To prove me thus. Away then all disguise! Know, though thou shouldst blame my frankness, Zelima Wrongs not, as false ones do, whom once she loves: And that I love thee, love thee in that sort That links my fate with thine, whoe'er thou be— GONZALVO. Gods! give me power to bear this flood of joy! Speak the blest words again, and bid me hope, E'en if I were the wretch thou oft hast named, Hated Gonzalvo— ZELIMA. Name him, name him not! But oh, I fear me, e'en if thou wert he, I could not hate thee: no, I fear I could not. GONZALVO. Swear it, my love! for I indeed am he! It is Gonzalvo clasps thee to his bosom. [She sinks into his arms. My Zelima! my love! The hated sound Has check'd the current of her life. Oh look! In pity look on me! She breathes! she lives! Enter Almanzor behind. ALMANZOR (aside). Or do I dream, or does Granada's princess Hang on the bosom of a wandering stranger? ZELIMA. From what fair dreams of bliss do I awake! What horrors compass me on every side! Oh thou, whom I so long have wish'd to name Other than “stranger!” thou, to whom my heart In secret gave each title that endears! How blest that ignorance I once deplored! ALMANZOR. (Coming hastily forward, and separating them roughly). A brother's arm protects the princess now. We thank you, sir, nor need your farther service. [Zelima appears terrified. GONZALVO. Fear nothing, princess; I am arm'd with patience, Nor heed the haughty Moor. ALMANZOR. “Thou heed'st me not!” Thou arrogant, nameless thing, that dost presume To parly with the princess of Granada! [Drawing. ZELIMA (rushing between them). Almanzor, ere thy sword shall reach the breast Of my preserver, it shall drench itself With thy poor sister's blood. ALMANZOR. Degenerate maid! Loose me, I say, and give my vengeance way. [Breaks from her and attacks Gonzalvo, who, after a short conflict, seizes his arm, and holds it firmly with superior strength. GONZALVO. Disdainful Moor! but thou'rt a sacred thing: Gonzalvo's sword shall never take thy life! [Releasing him with dignity. ALMANZOR. (After they have contemplated each other in silent astonishment). Is it the hated rival of my glory— Gonzalvo! who by stealth, in base disguise, Attempts the sister of his deadly foe? GONZALVO. It is Gonzalvo who restores that sister; Who honours her with such high reverence As good men pay to excellence divine. It is Gonzalvo, who, for her dear sake, Forgives the slanders of thy haughty tongue. ALMANZOR. Thou, the destroyer of my bleeding country! Thou, who too long hast choked my way to glory! Thou, the fell wolf, who in the shepherd's seeming, Hast stolen into the fold, and by this baseness Cancell'd the vaunted rescue of my sister, Think not I will forego my great revenge! Think not, for that, unmann'd by female cries, Thou took'st me at some disadvantage now, Thou shalt escape the fury of my arm. GONZALVO. Resentful as thou art, thou shalt not move me. Prince, I adjure thee by the tender love Thou needst must bear thy sister, I adjure thee By the white hairs of thy age-stricken father, And by thy people's weal, recall thy challenge. ALMANZOR. Never, Castilian! To the Spanish camp E'en now my herald bears the strong defiance: Defiance to the death! ZELIMA (clasping his knees). Almanzor, hear me! Dear brother of my love! I will not loose thee Till thou unknit thy gather'd brow. Oh, hear me! By all the joys of our first childish days; By all that memory hoards of tender—sacred— Oh, hear me!—hear me— ALMANZOR. For a Spaniard plead, Whose guile has won thy softness from the path Of duty and of honour? Nay, forbear. [Breaks from her, and aside. Each string that readiest in man's bosom vibrates, Jarr'd thus to agony! In glory's field Shoved from my place, and jostled by this boaster! Deliberately thus insulted now, Nay, almost pitied by the proud Castilian! [She attempts again to soothe him, and he puts her away. Away! begone! Here break we off. Look, sir; You meet me in the deadly strife to-morrow. [Exit. ZELIMA. Oh stay, my brother, stay, nor part in anger. He's gone, he's gone!—nor ever from his lips Did aught of harshness reach my ear till now. Wretch that I am! GONZALVO. Hear me, my Zelima! Bright hopes and dear forebodings fill my soul. Ere the slow herald reach my sov'reign's tents, I'll by a shorter course, with all love's speed, And ere his fatal purpose he declare, To gracious Isabel will speak of peace: My queen has often listen'd to my counsel. ZELIMA (with a melancholy smile). Thou wilt but woo the fowler to forego The quarry, while thou placest on his wrist Th' unerring falcon. GONZALVO (cheerfully). Nay, but if the bird Refuse to mount? ZELIMA. Alas! alas! what reasons Can sway the Spaniard from his cruel purpose? GONZALVO. Wrested by love, each circumstance shall prove An argument to win the soul from war. The losses late sustain'd by the besiegers, The hydra valour of the patriot Who fights for home, and all that makes home dear. ZELIMA. Fly, fly, Gonzalvo! kneel, implore, and paint In angel characters the charms of peace. Who shall resist thee if thou plead with all The soul-commanding eloquence thou own'st? [Pedro appears among the trees with Gonzalvo's armour. GONZALVO. Pedro, approach. PEDRO. My lord, behold the arms Your father gave you when he sent you forth The flower of Castilian knights. Away! Castile and Aragon demand their champion. GONZALVO. Farewell, my love! I pray thee droop not thus: Ere thou retire within thy father's palace, I will with tidings of success return. PEDRO. My lord, if you delay— GONZALVO. If I delay! My soul is on the rack with strong impatience. My shield! my corslet! [He throws off his turban and takes his armour; Zelima shrinks back terrified. Dost thou shudder, love, At this my hostile seeming? Many times In form horrific, choicest good appears. The deep-toned thunder, and the threat'ning cloud, Bring on the kindly shower,—and these dread arms Are harbingers of peace. ZELIMA. May they prove so! The God of mercy speed thee! Farewell, prince! Farewell! and oh, remember that thou bearest Within thy breast my life with thine entwined! [Exeunt severally. ACT III. SCENE I. The Spanish Camp. Royal Tents. Ferdinand and Isabella in full Council. Garcia, Alvarez, Spanish Nobles, &amp;c. FERDINAND. Princes and nobles, join'd in holy league Against the infidels, we have convened you, For that we have accepted the defiance Of proud Almanzor, in Gonzalvo's name, Who, as ye know, from Africa returns. Each moment we expect to welcome him. ISABELLA. And hark, my friends, the joyous sounds that ring, In gratulation wild, through all the air! He comes! 'tis he! the champion of Castile! Flourish of trumpets. Gonzalvo, attended by Lara, with great demonstrations of joy. He advances, and kneels at Isabella's feet. GONZALVO. Receive, my queen, the long expected treaty, Hardly obtain'd from Seïd, who disbands The forces destined to Granada's aid. ISABELLA. Welcome, Gonzalvo, welcome to our presence! Prince, we know all thou hast endured for us And our great cause. The thanks of Ferdinand And Isabel keep pace with thy deserts. FERDINAND. Prince, we have miss'd you in th' embattled field. Capricious victory but plays the wanton, Half granting, half withdrawing, the fair guerdon Of our hard service, since her favour'd chief No longer seeks her grace. (Aside to Lara). Haste, valiant Lara, Spread wide the joyful tidings through the camp, And rouse each spirit to the work of death, That must to-morrow make Granada ours. [Exit Lara. ISABELLA. The god who leads the armies of Castile Brings thee, brave prince, in an auspicious hour; Yes, brings thee, by a single feat in arms, To stamp eternal glory on thy name: The Moorish Chief, Almanzor, gives his life To thy unerring blade. Granada falls When proud Almanzor dies! GONZALVO. How may that be? The armed Moors defend their native land, Their heritage, their homes, their wives, their children. In such a cause a people rests not, Queen, Its every hope upon a single arm: Almanzor fallen, each Moor that has a heart Will an Almanzor rise to meet his foe. ISABELLA. It was not so they met thy sword, my friend. Mark me!—Almanzor slain, ere shrouding night Close on their consternation, we invest Granada on all sides. Abdoulah, sunk In luxury's soft lap, nor danger's voice, Nor glory's will awake. Without a chief, The infidels dispersed, an easy prey, Fall to our swords. The impious city rased, Fair peace shall smile o'er all this happy land! GONZALVO (with enthusiasm). Oh why, my queen! oh why may not fair peace Smile on this land ere it be drench'd in blood? Does peace delight in mangled carcasses, In dying groans, and agonizing shrieks? You will give peace to those who now would kiss The royal hand that dealt the precious boon, But who will then lie stretch'd upon the plain, Their spirits fled, where not that hand can reach To deal its bounteous gifts! FERDINAND (sarcastically). Venusa's prince Returns from Afric other than he went. GONZALVO. Oh, yes, my sovereigns: Since I parted hence, I have beheld misfortune face to face, Have mark'd the ills of desolating war In all the sad details kings never see. The sun that rises on the peasant's toil In happy lands not visited by war, And gilds their waving harvests with his beams, With barren splendour glares on desert fields Depopulated by the sword. The gale Sweeps sullen o'er them, loaded with the cries Of frantic widows and of orphan babes, That else had borne upon its gladsome wing The careless carol of the husbandman, Tilling in peace and liberty his field. FERDINAND. Is it Gonzalvo? He of Cordova? He on whose sword attended victory, Binding each day his brow with fresher laurels? He who was wont to lead Spain's gallant knights Gaily to battle as 'twere to a feast? GONZALVO. True, king, I led them on as to a feast— A feast of blood! Such laurels may beseem O'erbuoyant youth, maddening in glory's field! Reckless that every leaf of such a wreath Is, for the pearly dew-drop heaven had hung, Gemm'd with a drop of blood! [A general expression of discontent in the assembly. GARCIA. A shepherd swain, But not a soldier and a Spaniard, speaks. FERDINAND. Gonzalvo, sure, has sigh'd away his hours In Seïd's haram, where some soft sultana Has held this silken language. GARCIA. Can it be The fame obtain'd of late by brave Almanzor— GONZALVO (laying his hand on his sword). If any here believe my arm unbraced, Him do I challenge—let him feel its force. ISABELLA (haughtily). Prince of Venusa! you forget yourself. This language in our presence? GONZALVO. Pardon, queen! ISABELLA (graciously). 'Tis past. We know your valour, and the more Stand in astonishment at this your speech. GONZALVO. And can thy gracious nature, Isabel, Marvel that one who has so late received From Moors each right of hospitality, Should lay aside the rancorous despite Of an ungenerous foe? Granada's realm For centuries has been the native land Of its possessors. They who were usurpers Have long been dust—Oh! then let vengeance sleep. When Moorish fathers, husbands, brothers, sons, Fall by our swords, as many bosoms ache As among us when they fall whom we love. Have we not wasted the best blood of Spain Before these walls, firm rooted in the fealty Each thing that lives bears to its native place? Then spare alike the Spaniards and the Moors; 'Tis now th' auspicious moment when blest peace— FERDINAND (interrupting him). Forbear, Gonzalvo! lest thy recreant tongue Infect the warlike spirit of these chiefs. After a contest of so long a date, When Europe's eye and Africa's are fix'd Upon the issue of this glorious strife, When to our swords Granada gives herself, Shall we, brave knights, with sickly thoughts like these, And dainty hands that cannot dip in blood, Disdain to grasp her?—But if so it be Gonzalvo choose the rural joys he paints, Castile and Aragon have many heroes Ready to answer the proud Moor's defiance. [Several grasp their swords. GONZALVO. On your lives, sirs! 'tis mine exclusively! He that would meet Almanzor in the lists Must bear Gonzalvo's life upon his sword. FERDINAND. My noble friends! we much amiss interpret The brave Gonzalvo's words. See with what ardour He claims the glorious combat! none but he Shall win the deathless laurel victory wreathes To bind his honour'd brow. Behold, brave prince, The sword that graced the famed Rodrigo's side, The valiant Cid! th' avenger of his father! Who won Valencia's realm, and fair Ximena! [Ferdinand gives him the sword, which he accepts with apparent confusion. ISABELLA. Prince! you have need of rest: few hours remain Ere, summon'd by the warlike trumpet's voice, You teach the vaunting Moor what 'tis to dare To single fight th' invincible Gonzalvo! [Exeunt with ceremony, as the Scene closes. SCENE II. Before Lara's Tent. Enter Lara and Pedro. LARA. My faithful Pedro, this thy wondrous tale Confounds all reason. Oh! he is undone! Unhappy, lost Gonzalvo! that a girl, A Moorish girl, should by her wiles ensnare thee! PEDRO. Nay, sir, the princess is a gracious creature; My lord had died but for her tender care. Oh! she is innocent as nature's self, Fair as her fairest works, and yet withal She wears a native simple dignity, Commanding most when most her sweetness wins. LARA (smiling). Why, Pedro, thou hast caught thy master's frenzy. PEDRO. Oh! 'tis no time to jest. My lord has sworn His sword shall never take Almanzor's life. LARA. Blasted his fame! For ever wrapt in night, If he so bear himself as he has sworn! Gonzalvo throw his country's cause away! Impossible! Enter Gonzalvo. GONZALVO. Is it Lara speaks my name As 'twere in anger? Pity, sure, my friend, Had better suited thy Gonzalvo's sorrows. LARA. Oh, my Gonzalvo! I do pity thee; I pity thee, but I must blame thee too. GONZALVO. Speak, Lara, show me any way to escape The brand of treason or of perjury. LARA. We are our country's ere we are our own; This tie is prior to all other claims. GONZALVO. And know'st thou, Lara, all my country asks? LARA. To rid her of the proud insulting foe Who checks her arms. GONZALVO. Nay, more than that, my friend: To be ungrateful as the venomous serpent, That stung the bosom which had foster'd it; To mock the laws of hospitality, Sacred to all who bear the form of man: The very savage, in the deadly strife By life's first wants provoked, will slack the bow, Or drop th' uplifted club, if he but mark In th' adverse band his sometime host, whose hut Had housed him from the night storm. LARA. Why, Gonzalvo, Then why receive the sword of famed Rodrigo? Confirming thus th' acceptance of the challenge. GONZALVO. That none other might. LARA. Think'st thou no other arm Has power to wield? GONZALVO. Think'st thou the Spaniard lives Shall claim the challenge to Gonzalvo offer'd? LARA. Then wilt thou meet the Moor, and by thy arm Almanzor dies!—Thou art thyself again. GONZALVO (shuddering). “Almanzor dies!”—Is this to be myself? Oh horror! horror! which way soe'er I turn, Dishonour meets my view. Or I betray My country's sacred trust, or break the faith I swore to her I love! Shall a Castilian Not shudder at the charge of perjury? LARA. The time has been when we two, side by side, Like two young lions rush'd into the fight. The turban'd infidels, disparting wide, Shrank from the lightning of our swords. Thy soul Then knew not of these nice distinctions; no, Thy country, and her cause, and love of fame, Led thee resistless on. GONZALVO. I had not loved! LARA. The soldier has no leisure for soft love, Save when, his iron harness all unbraced, He gives his toil-worn limbs to careless ease, Or looser revelry; till braying trumpets Rouse to the war, and scare the baby god Far, far away, with all his idle toys. GONZALVO. Thou hast not loved if thou hast loved but so; And nothing know'st thou of the hallow'd bond Of virtuous attachment. He whose soul Owns with true loyalty his king and country, Alike is loyal to the maid he loves. For oh! what traitor, Lara, is more base Than he who steals a maid's first thoughts from peace, And leaves her desolate? LARA. I am not skill'd In Love's quaint rhetoric:—the subject's loyalty, The soldier's glory mine! GONZALVO. Alas, my friend! My thoughts of glory are not what they were. To stay the fury of wide-wasting war, And give fair peace to this distracted land; This was th' ambition that fill'd all my soul. How dear I hold my country, witness Heaven! But I would fold in my expanded love All—all her children, natives of her soil, And commoners to breathe her balmy gales. My friend, the vision's past! war still must rage. 'Tis doom'd!—To-morrow's sun must set in blood! Thousands must sleep in death!—But not Almanzor. I fly to tell her this. [Going. LARA. What would'st thou do? GONZALVO. Pedro! my steed, my steed!—Thou only, Lara, Couldst thus have held me from her. LARA (holding him). My Gonzalvo! GONZALVO. Off, Lara! stay me not.—Peace may not be! My Zelima must learn it from myself, Must know Almanzor's life to me is sacred; My own, thus lost to her, not worth my care. [Exit. LARA. Follow him, Pedro—Nay, a moment stay— This passion robs him of his better judgment. Mark me!— [After anxious thought. Remind him not how fly the hours, And lead him if thou canst through devious paths,— And still of Zelima thy converse be,— Devise delays as best thou canst, old man: His life, his fame, hang on thy skill in this, Nay more, the weal of Spain! PEDRO. I will, my lord; But how may this delay avert the ill? LARA. Gain but a day.—Let pass this fever'd dream, Then Glory's voice and Lara's will be heard. Gonzalvo's valour who shall dare to question? And trust to friendship;—yes, there yet are means To save his fame!—His well-known casque, his shield, Now lie within my tent.—My soul beats high— Yes, either host shall deem Gonzalvo's arm Deals the unerring stroke!—His proudest courser Shall think he yields but to Gonzalvo's mastery!— Follow him, Pedro,—soothe him, and be secret. [Exeunt severally. ACT IV. SCENE I. The Wood. Zelima, Gonzalvo. ZELIMA. Yes, we must part:—leave, leave the wretch thou hast made. Oh, fly me! Hush—methought I heard a voice! The breath of morning, panting on the leaves, Comes o'er me like deep thunders.—Heard'st thou aught? GONZALVO. 'Twas but the carol of the early woodman. Thy looks affright me: no, I cannot leave thee. ZELIMA. Thou must! thou must! and I must learn to see In him who saved me but my country's foe. It is a fearful task! for deep, too deep Is stamp'd thy image here. Oh leave me then To utter sadness,—lonely,—desolate,— That I may conjure to my weak heart's aid The ghosts of all my butcher'd countrymen, Whose pil'd up corses built thy cruel fame. Thy true love's token be the sword that slew them! I'll fix my eyes on the blood-crusted blade, And listen to the sobbing of the night-blast, Till to my ear it seem the upbraiding wail Of dying men, cursing the unhallow'd love I bear their murderer! GONZALVO. Oh, check thy speech, Lest my brain turn, and, urg'd by fell despair— ZELIMA. 'Tis I who must despair!—for thou art call'd To take my brother's life, or he must plunge His ruthless blade in my preserver's breast. I am alike destroy'd by either blow. Already treason!—ere the sun go down It may be fratricide to love Gonzalvo! Then listen what I swear. If in the lists Thou prove victorious, glory be thy meed! Never will Zelima behold the man Who bears her brother's blood upon his sword. GONZALVO. Then art thou mine! for at thy feet I vow, By all the passion in this bosom pent— By all my sufferings—by thy sacred self— By all the trembling hope—by all the joy Thy tender pity pour'd upon my soul— Gonzalvo's hand shall never take the life Of one who is thy brother! ZELIMA. In this grove Thou hast no witness of thy deeds, Gonzalvo, Save love, and thy poor weeping Zelima. But think'st thou, when the glorious lists appear, Thy haughty queen, the king of Aragon, With their proud court in all its bravery; On either side the eyes of an arm'd host Fix'd on your single swords;—the shouting voice Of thousands pour'd upon the gale,—oh! think'st thou, When all these strike at once upon the sense, They will not rouse the terrible Gonzalvo, And bear you on—O horrid, horrid image! My bleeding brother! the exulting foe! GONZALVO. Have I not sworn Almanzor's life is sacred? ZELIMA. Ha! cruel! thou would'st say thyself will fall, And if thou fall, 'tis I—'tis I have doom'd thee! There's madness in that thought! Thou shalt not go: Yet stay awhile—my brother's rage is high: Thou shalt not meet his fury—no, thou shalt not— Thus will I fetter thee! [Clinging round his neck. GONZALVO. And here, my love, Here will I grow; and ever, ever, thus Live in thy eyes, and lose myself in joy! Farewell to fame! since thou will have it so. Rest on this bosom, it is thine alone. Welcome dishonour for thy sake!—But hark! [After a pause. What sound was that? a distant trumpet!—hark! Again?—It bears on every blast reproach! The sun is high—th' appointed hour is past! Again! again! it swells upon the gale.— Ha! now the mingling roar should rather seem Of general conflict. Never yet Gonzalvo Turn'd from the battle! Louder, louder still! My soul burns in me!—infamy, disgrace, Are on my name! I come! I come!—Farewell! Haste, Fatima—haste, Zayda—Moorish maids, Support your princess—soothe her tenderly. [Enter Moorish women, to whose care he commits her insensible with terror. My Zelima, to live for thee denied, Death for thy sake is sweet, but not dishonour! [He rushes out. ZELIMA (recovering, and looking wildly around.) Where am I?—what has chanced?—Ha! where is he? Sure he was here e'en now!—and is he gone?— See, see! he spurs his courser o'er the plain;— He rushes to the fight! Oh, spare my brother! Thou shalt not murder him. Forbear, Almanzor! And would'st thou thus repay a sister's rescue? Oh! pity, pity! Sheathe your murderous blades! Live! cruel ones! Live for your Zelima! [Sinks into their arms, and scene closes. SCENE II. The Royal Tents. Isabella, Alvarez, &amp;c. ISABELLA. No message from the king? Alas! my fears! Had Spain's brave champion triumph'd o'er the Moor, Garcia, (so I enjoin'd him), had, ere now, Brought the glad tidings. Hast thou mark'd, Alvarez, When adverse clouds o'er th' Alpuxares meet, A shuddering stillness creep through all the air Ere the storm burst? Such Ferdinand observing, Through either host as either champion yielded, Urged me to quit the lists. I ne'er before Beheld so fierce, so obstinate a combat. Who would have thought, beneath a turban wrapt, Such matchless hardihood, such desperate valour? Enter Garcia. GARCIA. This praise from Isabel be now his meed! Almanzor's fall'n! ISABELLA. Then victory is ours! GARCIA. Alas! not so: the Moors, with frantic cries, Rush'd on our troops: a general fight ensued; And oh, my queen! with grief and shame, these eyes Beheld the Spaniards yield. Enter Ferdinand. FERDINAND. Joy, joy, my Isabel; The tide of war is turn'd! Our Spaniards fled,— In wild disorder fled!—when from the camp Darted, with eagle speed, one all unarm'd, Save that he brandish'd wide his desperate sword, Maddening with rage: and “Spaniards!” he exclaim'd, “Castilians! men of Aragon! ho! stand! It is Gonzalvo calls you to the field!” All turn'd at once: the Moors are panic-struck! Impetuous as the hurricane, Gonzalvo Bears down the yielding foe, following amain The refluent tide of battle. ISABELLA. Gallant youth! Pride of Castile! But how saidst thou “unarm'd?” In panoply complete he met the Moor. FERDINAND. So deem'd each host: but when with toil o'erspent, And hard-earn'd victory, the conqueror sunk, His squires unbraced his casque to give him air, And lo! brave Lara's lineaments! ISABELLA. Amazement! FERDINAND. More wonderful what follow'd, Isabel. Our soldiers seize the slain Almanzor's corse: Behold Gonzalvo head a Moorish band, Defend the lifeless chief with frantic zeal; And, aiding the heart-stricken Moors, convey The corse from off the field. ISABELLA. Most strange, indeed! GARCIA. Venusa's prince false to the cause of Spain! ALVAREZ. Nor leave to hungry dogs an infidel's Unhallow'd corse? FERDINAND. Returning, now he mark'd Brave Lara 'mongst a host of vengeful Moors, Though faint and bleeding, holding them at bay: With lightning's speed he rush'd upon them.—Lost To my sight, I know not the event. ISABELLA. My liege, Oh doubt it not!—'tis victory! FERDINAND. Be ours To improve the advantage gained. Come, Isabel; We must take order for to-morrow's onset. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Before Lara's Tent. Enter Lara, leaning on his attendants as if wounded; Gonzalvo by his side in great disorder. LARA. I pray thee, my Gonzalvo, rave not thus! Nay, hast thou not eclips'd thy former glory; Snatching amidst defeat itself the palm Of victory? Hast thou not redeem'd from death Thy Lara, too? Oh, who so blest, my friend, That would not barter lots with thee this day? GONZALVO. None who could read my heart. Enough of this: Speak of thy safety, of thy life, thy fame, For that is all saved from my wreck of bliss. LARA. Thy wreck of bliss when thou hast sav'd thy country? GONZALVO. Is not Almanzor dead, and by thy hand? LARA. Yes, by my hand! Would'st thou that I had bared My bosom to the Infidel's assault? He met me not to joust in tournament— Or he had fallen or I. GONZALVO. It was not thine The combat—'twas thy friend's. Had he met me, Almanzor had return'd to bless his Zelima. Wretch that I am! Ev'n now, ev'n now, alas! My princess bends o'er her dear slaughter'd brother, Deeming Gonzalvo perjured, false—a murderer! He, who so lately at her feet had sworn Almanzor's blood should never stain his sword! Is't not enough, that, every hope shut out, Despair be mine, but she must think this hand, This treach'rous hand, has slaughter'd him? [Lara takes his hand kindly. Away! Offer not consolation, Lara. Off! Thou liv'st. My soul, at least, is spared remorse For thee! thou art the victor! Wear the blood-stain'd wreath, Thy valour's due, and leave me to my sorrow. [Turning from him. LARA. My friendship is not dear to thee as once, Gonzalvo— GONZALVO. He is to holy friendship's laws A stranger, who knows not to sympathise In his friend's sorrows, though he ne'er have proved Like ills himself. Thou art my fellow soldier, Not my friend. LARA. Nor friend, nor fellow soldier, Is welcome to thee more. The flatterer—yes, The servile flatterer, is the friend thou would'st; But Lara cannot be Gonzalvo's flatterer. Go, bind the silken turban round thy brow, Forswear thy friend, thy country, and thy fame; Go revel in the Moorish wanton's smiles, And at her feet— GONZALVO (drawing). The Moorish wanton! say'st thou? [Pedro rushes between them, and catches Gonzalvo's arm. LARA (baring his bosom, and with much emotion). But first take back the worthless life thy hand So lately gave to him thy recreant heart No longer owns. [Gonzalvo gives his sword to Pedro, and turning axay, hides his eyes with his hands. PEDRO (going up to LARA). My lord is not himself. Your wounds still bleed: I pray you be more calm. [To his attendants. My friends, attend The valiant Lara—bind his wounds afresh. [Exit Lara supported. Pray you, my lord, allow me to attend you To your own tents. Indeed you need repose. Haply your faithful Pedro, who has shared The chances that have wrought this change in you, May better soothe the anguish of your mind. GONZALVO. “The Moorish wanton!”—“Revel in her smiles!” Her brother's blood still reeking on his sword, To wrong her thus! With friendship's holy name To grace such insults! PEDRO. Oh! be calm, my lord. GONZALVO. Yes, Pedro, I will see her once again; Tell her this hand is guiltless of his blood— Pardon obtain—or at her feet expire! PEDRO. My lord, you rave. The princess is retired Within th' Albaysin palace with her father. It were impossible to enter there, As 'twere to scale yon skies.—Impossible! GONZALVO. No, Pedro, nothing is impossible To one who greatly dares. I can but die, And it is better far to die, while, ardent, I aim my soul's strong purpose to effect, Than sit me down as coward spirits use, And, unresisting, sigh my life away. Yes, I will see her!—Let me pass. PEDRO. My lord, 'Tis madness—'tis impossible!—I pray you Bethink you better. [Attempting to stop him. GONZALVO (with violence). Nay, attempt not, Pedro, One to dissuade who is so bent as I am. Yes, I will enter the proud city thus! My arms alone are known—alone are fear'd. What Moor will dream the wretched thing he sees Was once Gonzalvo? I shall pass unheeded Amidst the consternation of defeat. [He rushes out wildly, leaving his sword in Pedro's hand. Pedro, after a moment of consternation, follows him. ACT V. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Albaysin Palace. Muley Hassan and Zelima. ZELIMA. Look up, my father; thus thy hoary head Low in the dust! MULEY HASSAN. My dear, my duteous daughter! I strive to thank the prophet thou art left me, But cannot waken grateful thoughts within My frozen bosom, too severely chasten'd. My gentle child, can I no longer love thee? [Weeps. ZELIMA. Weep, weep, my father, give thy sorrow vent; Despair not wholly lords it o'er the heart That can dissolve in tears. MULEY HASSAN. Hah! saidst thou so? Then wherefore see I not thy female softness Melting in floods of woe? ZELIMA. The time may come That I shall weep.—We both have lost Almanzor: Pride and support of both!—What else of ill May heap the measure of my grief so high, Methinks despair can be but this—regards None other.—It is mine—mine only. MULEY HASSAN. Thy tones of anguish thrill my soul.—My child, For thy poor broken-hearted father's sake, Speak yet some word of comfort and of hope. ZELIMA. He swore the brother of his Zelima Was sacred to his sword! the oath still hung On his perfidious lip.—Alas! my father, That the dear hand which rescued Zelima, Should pierce her bosom thus! MULEY HASSAN. Degenerate maid! Thy murder'd brother welters in his blood, And thou canst name in terms that breathe not hate The foe who slew him! ZELIMA. Not in a moment can we learn to hate One we have loved so well. Is it not hard To call him false whom I had thought so true? For thanks and blessings now to utter curses? But I will bear myself as bitterest hate, And dire revenge should prompt, nor ever see The false, the cruel, perjured Spaniard more. Enter Omar. OMAR. Good king! my princess! I am charged with tidings May soothe a father's grief. MULEY HASSAN. Is't death thou bring'st? OMAR. A boon more precious, Muley Hassan,—vengeance! Gonzalvo's taken. MULEY HASSAN. Dost thou mock my sorrow? OMAR. My words are true. Unarm'd the Spaniard roam'd, As one distraught, around the palace walls: His wild disorder'd mien awaked suspicion, Hemm'd in by numbers, madly he exclaims, “Moors, dare ye meet Gonzalvo?” they shrink back In blank amazement; when, indignant, one Cries, “Countrymen! What!—shall a swordless arm “Ward off a thousand sabres?” Struck with shame, They close around and seize him. King Abdoulah Commands his blood be shed at the obsequies Of slain Almanzor. ZELIMA. Let me rather die Than witness the too savage rites of vengeance! Revenge may soothe the angry spirit's pain, Not heal the broken heart. MULEY HASSAN. My life's last comfort! Oh! I shall lose thee too! (To her women). Support her—soothe her. [Zelima retires among her women in great disorder. Am I a Moor? and is not vengeance dear? How lost am I!—Alas! alas! my son, 'Twere sweeter far to sheathe the dagger here, And lay me down by thee, than shed the blood Of him who saved thy sister. At my feet When he lies lifeless, will thy lips, my son, Or smile, or breathe? or shall I aught regain Of all I lose in thee?—No—I shall look, As now, on all around, a hideous blank, And wish alike for death! OMAR. The mournful train, With solemn symphonies, draws near the palace. Abdoulah wisely urges all despatch, For that an aged follower of Gonzalvo Unheeded 'scaped, and may alarm the Spaniards. MULEY HASSAN. I come—thy arm.—Oh! give me courage, Allah! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Court of the Palace. The funeral procession of Almanzor. Gonzalvo chained and guarded: the executioner by his side. CHORUS OF MOORS. For the warrior young and brave, Doom'd untimely to the grave, Pour on the passing gale the voice of woe; And mark, as deep and sad the numbers flow Successive from the heart;—the hollow groan Falls on the ear!—It is a father's moan! And now the silver tone Of female tenderness dissolves the soul: A sister's inbred love disdains control, Mourning the friend, the brother, and the chief, With wild impassion'd grief. The airs that erst with gratulation rung, Now on dank pinions hung, Bear heavily the plaint a nation breathes, That sorrowing wreathes Funereal garlands for her hero slain, Slain in his country's cause, on yon ensanguined plain! CHORUS OF YOUTHS. We who on his steps attending, Learnt from him the soldier's part, Valour, fortitude unbending, For our sacred home contending! Can we tear him from our heart? No, by our leader's bier, our arms laid low, Wait we, in mute despair, the now victorious foe. [Laying down their arms by the bier. CHORUS OF MAIDENS. Opening radiant with the morning Beam'd the smile we strove to share; For that smile all others scorning: Now for whom her charms adorning Would the Moorish maid be fair? Our chaplets, faded, on his bier we throw, Our braided tresses tear, and join a sister's woe! [Placing their garlands on the bier. CHORUS OF MOORS. Wake a more impetuous lay! Keener pangs our bosoms sway, By patriot rage, and frenzied anguish tost! Yet—yet—all is not lost! Revenge! Revenge, is ours! Her bitter smile Our sorrow shall beguile! Revenge shall yet a thrilling joy impart, Dear to the Moorish heart! While cold Despair shall guide her frantic hand Deep in the murd'rer's breast to plunge the ruthless brand! YOUTHS AND MAIDENS. Breathe again funereal strains, Give to dust the loved remains; While from seats of glory bending Angels hymn the soul ascending; While a grateful nation's sighs Waft the hero to the skies, And its tears embalm his name, Thus by a people's love consign'd to deathless fame. MULEY HASSAN. Prepare thee, youth, to die. Spite of this tear, Revenge anon will brace my unstrung nerves To taste the joys she gives. GONZALVO. Oh, Muley Hassan! Thy gentle tongue erewhile bade me aspire To call thee father! erring vengeance now Prompts that same tongue to speak the doom of death On one who has not injured thee. MULEY HASSAN. Ha! Spaniard, Thou hast not injured me?—Look there! Look there! [Pointing to the bier. GONZALVO. I do beseech thee, ere I bow my head, And court the blow that rids me of this life, Allow me but once more to see thy daughter: Oh! see me kneel for this, and weep before thee! MULEY HASSAN (aside). And must I pity him?—At distance yonder, Behold the wreck of all that was so joyous! So beautiful!—A little month ago (So tender was her nurture) had she died, She never had known sorrow. (To the attendants). Lead her on. Speak, prince, we may not long delay. [Zelima totters forward supported, and on seeing Gonzalvo, hides her face in her father's bosom. GONZALVO. Nay, turn And look on me!—It is for thee I die, And innocent of all offence to thee. ZELIMA. Perfidious Spaniard! false as thou art cruel! [To Muley Hassan. (No, I will not disgrace thee, my dear father, By any show of pity, though it kill me). [To Gonzalvo. Didst thou not swear to me in yonder grove My brother's life was sacred to thy sword? And swiftly as thy fleetest steed could bear thee, Didst rush on him and deal the deadly blow? GONZALVO. No, it was I who saved yon corse from insult. ZELIMA. Is it thus thou givest me my rescued brother? Is this thy pledge of faith? GONZALVO. I slew him not:— I go to death, my faith to thee unbroken. Say, thou believest—Oh! my Zelima, Say, too, thou pitiest me. ZELIMA (giving way to tenderness). Nay, canst thou wish Such twofold torture to poor Zelima, As but to think thy hand is innocent, And see thee thus?—Spare me, and say thou'rt guilty. THE EXECUTIONER. We may not thus delay the obsequies. MULEY HASSAN (with assumed firmness). My injured country, prince, demands thy blood. Thy life is forfeit to the sacred dead; A father's vengeance claims it! (To Zelima. Thou, my child, withdraw. [Zelima retires in great disorder. And now, dread minister of justice, strike! GONZALVO. My Zelima! my love! farewell for ever! [Muley Hassan hides his face. The executioner lifts his axe, when Lara and Pedro rush in. LARA. Stay—stay your hands! ye impious murderers! I!—I slew your Almanzor! MULEY HASSAN. Who art thou? None other but Gonzalvo could have done it! LARA. Here Lara stands to avouch the glorious deed! Behold Almanzor's conqueror! GONZALVO. My Lara! Whither would cruel friendship lead thee? Go— Sever'd from her I love, death is my choice. Live, Lara, live, for Spain and for Gonzalvo. (To the Executioner). Strike, Moor! why stand ye thus suspended? (To Muley Hassan). Command, good king! This frantic man would save His friend, and knows not what he says. LARA. Old king! I swear 'twas I who slew thy son. GONZALVO. Strike here! the king, Abdoulah, bade despatch. Dread the fierce tyrant's wrath. (To Lara.) Away, my friend! Thy artifice shall not prevail. LARA (to the Executioner.) Strike here! ZELIMA (rushing from among the women, and throwing herself at her father's feet). Pardon, my father, both these noble youths! 'Tis Lara speaks the truth—Gonzalvo pardon, For that he tarried with thy Zelima, Swearing to spare her brother, while his friend Struck at our peace; yet pardon Lara too, For that he thus would die to save Gonzalvo. MULEY HASSAN. The Spaniard's blood will not allay the pang That rankles in this breast; but how may these Consent to lose the sweets of promised vengeance? ZELIMA (to the attendants). My friends, who knew my brother's generous soul, Think you his spirit may be soothed by blood Of kindred spirits butcher'd o'er his tomb? Not nobly shed in battle?—No—'tis he, 'Tis my Almanzor's hovering ghost that prompts My feeble voice to cry for mercy!—Mercy! [Distant sounds are heard of the storming of the city. Enter Omar hastily. OMAR. Granada is invested on all sides! The vengeful Spaniards lay the city waste, Claiming their leaders, Lara and Gonzalvo. GONZALVO. Release me, king, and I will stay their fury: It were more grateful to Almanzor's spirit That I should stanch his country's blood, than shed My own upon his corse. ALL THE MOORS. Release him, king! Release the noble Spaniard! [Muley Hassan releases him, and Pedro gives him his arms. GONZALVO (embracing LARA). Oh, my Lara, Generous and brave alike!—My Zelima! Yes, thou dost pity me—deny it not! ZELIMA. Haste, haste, dear prince, nor lose again the moment. MULEY HASSAN. Let them depart, while thou and I consign To earth, the mortal part of him whom now The Prophet welcomes to the bowers of bliss. [Exeunt Gonzalvo and Lara on one side, followed by the young Moors. On the other the funeral procession, with Muley Hassan, Zelima, Maidens, &amp;c. and the Scene closes. SCENE III. A public Part of Granada. Storming of the City heard. Spaniards and Moors in great confusion, fighting: the Moors driven off.—Muley Hassan and Zelima afterwards, with attendants. MULEY HASSAN. My friends, it is the Prophet's will these eyes Should see, ere yet they close, Granada's realm— Land of my fathers—fall!—My son! thou sleepest The eternal sleep, not ev'n thy country's groans May break!—I am resign'd! [He kneels, and for a moment is wrapt in devotion, While yet I reign'd, I did not cause my people's tears to flow; And at this awful moment, when I wait The stroke of death, no form terrific gleams Athwart my soul of one accusing Moor! [The noise redoubles. ZELIMA. The dreadful tumult grows upon the ear! Havoc and death approach!—My dear, dear father! [Clinging to him. They shall not tear thee from me—my last breath Shall speak a blessing on thy parting child. They come! they come!—Oh, hold me to thy heart! Enter Selim. SELIM. The guard is forced!—Within the gates they rage, The furious Spaniards!—Fly, my princess, fly! Fly, good old man! (Kneeling.) I was thy subject once, And my heart owns thee still—Oh! if my arm Could stay the stroke that threats thy reverend head, One moment stay it—think'st thou I would fly?— But they are thousands drunk with blood and conquest. [Starts up, and exit. Spaniards rush in, led by Garcia. GARCIA. This—this is he! the hoary infidel! Drag him before victorious Ferdinand! [They seize him. A SPANIARD (seizing ZELIMA). This is a prize indeed!—Come on, fair Moor! ZEZIMA (struggling). Save me, my father! save me from these ruffians! Gonzalvo! Oh Gonzalvo! where art thou? MULEY HASSAN. Unhand her, villains! Leave the royal maid! ZELIMA. Save me! MULEY HASSAN. Can age, e'en palsied age, unnerve The arm of him who hears a daughter's cry! Oh, my heart's darling!—Brutal villains, off! [He makes a violent effort, breaks from them, strikes down one, rescues his Daughter, is wounded by Garcia in the struggle, and sinks into Zelima's arms. This trembling hand was arm'd with Heaven's might To save a daughter!—Yes, I hold thee still— Thanks to the Prophet!—Cling to me—I faint. ZELIMA. Oh gracious Allah! See—he bleeds—Help! help! Enter Lara. LARA. Whence came that piercing shriek?—The Moorish princess! Hold, ruffians, hold!—Hold in Gonzalvo's name! [To Muley Hassan. From him I come with grateful tidings, king, Alas, I fear too late!—Recal thy spirit— Peace to thy bleeding country! MULEY HASSAN (reviving). Oh! I thank thee! That word has life in't.—I can hear thy tale. I bleed apace, but my firm spirit yet Wings not its flight— [To Zelima. It hangs on all it loves, And will not part. LARA. The tide of blood is stayed. The heartless Moors, deprived of their Almanzor, Yielded on all sides, when Gonzalvo's voice Quarter proclaim'd, and check'd the hot pursuit In the names of Ferdinand and Isabel. In gentlest triumph see the victors come! MULEY HASSAN. I breathe more freely. ZELIMA (with rapture). Yes, thy swimming eyes Are lighted with new fire. Oh thou wilt live, And bless thy daughter still! MULEY HASSAN. Yes, Zelima, I grapple still with death, and will not yield. A purpose to my parting soul most dear, Supports me still a space against the course Of nature—and I will—will yet— Enter Ferdinand and Isabella, Gonzalvo, Spanish Nobles, &amp;c. GONZALVO (kneeling, and raising MULEY HASSAN). Oh, Muley Hassan! honour'd, reverend king! What ruthless hand has done this?—Look on me, Dear, good old man! and call me once thy son. MULEY HASSAN (joining their hands). Protect her—Oh! my son! ISABELLA. Live, Muley Hassan! Live to bless these, and see thy people blest! The weal of fall'n Granada we commit To thy Gonzalvo. MULEY HASSAN. Now I die content— Thanks, generous victors!—Oh, my Zelima! My pent soul flutters to be gone.—We must— Yes, we must part.—I forced my spirit—stay Awhile—and still—still would behold thee once— Why dost thou vanish?—Why dost flit away? My child—my child—I hope—I hope I die Within thy arms. (Reaching, as if to seek her). Oh! that I could feel thee!— Press me—Oh! press me to thy heart, my child! [Dies. [After a pause Zelima lays her cheek to his face, and starting. ZELIMA. Hush! hush! was't not a breath of life that fann'd My cheek? [Laying her hand on his breast. Oh no!—no, no—I may not hope— Thy kind heart beats no more beneath my hand— All, all is still!—My father! oh, my father! [She leans over the body lost in grief,Gonzalvo supporting her. The Curtain drops. PEDRARIAS A TRAGIC DRAMA. This drama was written in May 1811, and has been revised at different periods since. For the story see “Les Incas” of Marmontel. As it is one of pure invention, it was thought allowable to take great liberties with it. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Pedrarias D'Avila, governor of the Isthmus of Darien. Alphonso, his son. Gusman, his minister. Lopez, and other Spanish nobles. Perez, a spy. Capana, an Indian cacique. Houaco, his son, at first under the name of Zamori. Thelasco, an Indian warrior. Kali, an Indian. Lascala, an old Indian. Amazilia, a young Indian woman of high birth, betrothed to Houaco. Laila, her friend. An old Indian woman. Spanish Soldiers, Indians, &amp;c. SCENE, Panama, and mountains of the adjacent country. ACT I. SCENE I. Indian scenery. Groups of Indians pass over the stage with garlands, &amp;c. as if busily employed in preparations for a rustic sacrifice. Thelasco enters alone from the opposite side, and Kali comes forward from the other Indians to meet him. KALI. Welcome, Thelasco, welcome! Thou return'st In happy hour. Our good cacique, Capana, Wills that the feast of vengeance be completed This very day. The rites are all prepared. THELASCO. What mean'st thou, Kali? Ere the last moon waned, Nine of the fell invaders, by our warriors Surprised and taken on yon wilds, had bled: One breathed alone, when with my chosen band Again I sought the foe. KALI. True, brave Thelasco; For nine successive days our people feasted, Pouring forth songs before the God of Vengeance, While on his altars flow'd a Spaniard's blood; But nought of joy stole on the settled sorrow Of good Capana. On the tenth, the sun Frown'd on our rites; the angry thunders roar'd; The ominous tear rolled down Capana's cheek; The rites were stopp'd. THELASCO. But sure the sun has smiled With ray benignant many a day since then? KALI. And yet the sacrifice has still been stay'd. Our great cacique best reads portentous skies, Nor till this day has deem'd the signs propitious. With sadden'd brow e'en now— THELASCO. Alas! what sadness Can thus hang heavy on Capana's breast? Has he not saved the remnant of his people By his sole godlike wisdom, and his valour? Did he not lead us, press'd by foes and famine, O'er mountains, inaccessible to all But those who follow such a leader? One, Whose bleeding wounds mark, drop by drop, the course He cheers his bands to follow: whose parch'd lips, Smiling, refuse the cooling draught we scoop In the cleft rock—bidding his follower drink! Till in this valley, by these heights hemm'd in, (Committing us, as 'twere, to Nature's bosom), He bids us live secure—beyond the reach Of fierce Pedrarias, and his lawless rout. Can he retrace these deeds and taste of sadness? KALI. Valiant Thelasco!—thou art not a father, Or had'st not ask'd that question. THELASCO. True:—Houaco Was on the fatal field or slain, or lost; But two long summers, since gone by, might blunt Remembrance:—and the bloody day that reft Capana of a people, and a son, Closed that son's course in glory! Mark'd you not How many his unerring hatchet laid in dust? I saw them writhe in death! I heard them groan! That is a music never shall be poured Upon th' invader's ear from Indian lips! Speaking of the natives on the coast of those provinces known by the names of Paria and Cumana, Robertson says, “They seemed to possess a better understanding, and greater courage, than the inhabitants of the islands.” History of America, Book II. We laugh amidst the tortures they inflict, And sing our death song—while these sons o' th' sea, (Cast by distemper'd ocean on our shores), If chance the feather'd shaft, or missile bone, Invade their blanch'd and delicate limbs, forget, And shame, their manhood thus. KALI. Yet by their arts Of fatal magic, that compel the cloud To yield reluctant from its wreathing folds The smouldering bolt—by their bright arms that flash Forged lightnings, bickering, impious, to the sun, And by their iron coats that mock our shafts, They are invincible. THELASCO. Invincible! No, Kali, no. Hast thou not seen the deep With hideous swell, wave over wave, bear on, As it would swallow, in its might, our shores? And do not still our green and laughing shores Mock at its rage? E'en thus let us oppose Resistance firm, unalterable—thus mock Their glittering terrors, and their coward mail. KALI. Such reckless valour, what has it avail'd us? THELASCO. And dost thou call that valour reckless valour Which saved thee, Kali, and thy trembling fellows, When conquer'd by these idle fears ye fled, Or fell unhurt? Eternal shame!—No more— We loiter. I to Capana must report How undisturb'd I and my band have roam'd The unpeopled wastes, nor found a straggler more Of this fell race, to thee so terrible![Exeunt severally. Amazilia and Laila come forward from among the woody scenery. LAILA (following AMAZILIA, who seems to avoid her). All is prepared. The troops of damsels hymn The song of sacrifice. Fair Amazilia, Here is a wreath of flowers to deck thy brow: Here is thy flowing veil: thou heed'st me not— Thou dost not smile. AMAZILIA. Why should I smile, my Laila? This is a solemn sacrifice—a sad one. Is not death sad? LAILA. When 'tis our foe that dies, We Indians “Even after the error which gave rise to this opinion (that the new world was part of India) was detected, and the true position of the new world was ascertained, the name has remained; and the appellation of West Indies is given by all the people of Europe to the country, and that of Indians to its inhabitants.”—Robcrtson's History of America, Book II. hold it is a joyous sight. AMAZILIA. “Our foe?”—Methinks this poor, ill-fated youth, Has not the semblance of a foe to any. LAILA. Is he not of the band of fell destroyers? Dost thou not hate him? AMAZILIA. Yes—I hope I hate him. LAILA. Why dies the word upon thy faltering lip? AMAZILIA (taking her hand affectionately). Thou wast my friend. Am I still dear to thee? LAILA. Indeed, indeed, thou art! I never thought But as thy nobler nature swayed my mind, And am in all devoted to thy will. AMAZILIA. A month has pass'd, and ever as this youth Has been led forth to bleed before our gods, Thou know'st Capana has been moved to pity; And canst thou blame a woman's gentler nature, If, touch'd with soft compassion, I relented? I would not see him die. LAILA. The God of Vengeance Demands his blood. AMAZILIA (with energy). Oh! but the God of Mercy Bids the poor captive live! LAILA. Alas! the Indians Know not of such a God—and how shouldst thou? AMAZILIA. The captive Christian bade me serve him, Laila! LAILA. Thy words and gestures fill my soul with terror. How couldst thou learn aught of the captive's worship? AMAZILIA. Each night, when all, within this happy valley, Lay hush'd in sleep, compassion led my steps To the young captive's cave; and near the entrance, Unseen by him, I oft would chant the lays Our mothers teach, when death has claim'd our warriors, To cheat the hideous phantom of his terrors. But while I sang of nature's sweet repose, Lapt in the bosom of the parent earth, My heart disown'd the fraud—and form'd the wish That he might live, whom thus I woo'd to die! He too address'd me in such accents, Laila, I could not choose but listen. His heav'n-taught words, Awful yet sweet, waked in me a new soul. In lowly ignorance, and abject fear, Erewhile I trembled when the thunders roll'd; And in each element a mighty power, Angry and vengeful, sought t' appease. But now, Oh now! a father's warning voice I hear In solemn thunders!—see his gracious smile In the sun's beams—his hand beneficent In the earth's fruits—nor fear might infinite, With goodness infinite!—Infinite mercy, Wisdom, and love—as in Alphonso's God! LAILA. And did a God so bounteous send them forth To ravage India? AMAZILIA. No:—he bade them spare. More have I learnt, my Laila. These destroyers, These cruel men who drench our land with blood, Have some among them who are like this youth; But they are few, and o'erborne by the many. LAILA. Oft, Amazilia, have I mark'd of late Thy alter'd mien, and the high views that fill'd Thy labouring mind: still thou wert ever kind, Nor didst disdain thy Laila's humble love. Give me then all thy thoughts. AMAZILIA. They are all—all, To save the youth! Dear Laila, come with me, And we will pray Alphonso's God to aid us: He will inspire my dark, untutor'd mind In his own holy cause—the cause of mercy! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A deep valley, inclosed by inaccessible mountains, filled with Indian huts, mixed with palm-trees, &amp;c. In the front a rustic throne under a spreading palm, and an altar with an image rudely carved, representing the God of Vengeance. Enter Capana (properly attended), in conversation with Thelasco. CAPANA. Believe me, brave Thelasco, 'tis not weakness. Thou hast shared my counsels, and hast ever been My partner in the fight. When hast thou known Vain shapes, and idle phantoms, move my spirit? Our very Gods have pleaded for this youth: A boding voice has sounded in my heart; Nay, strange portentous signs have stain'd the skies! The guards that, nightly watching, skirt the valley, Have heard melodious warblings round his cave, Soothing his slumbers, and have trembled, awe-struck. Whene'er I communed with him, he, methought, Held all my troubled spirit in control. If these destroyers are like him endow'd, Alas! for India's sons! THELASCO. Alas! for thee! Alas! for India's sons, should he escape! He would divulge the place of our retreat. CAPANA (sorrowfully). I know it well: and therefore have decreed The consummation of the sacrifice. THELASCO. That one of this fell race should move thee thus! CAPANA. He is a father's only son, he says: I had no son, my friend, save young Houaco. [Brushing away a tear. What had I felt had he a captive stood Before a Spaniard? THELASCO. Ha! had he found mercy? Let double tortures rack this cozener! [The procession for the sacrifice approaches, winding through the trees. Alphonso bound and guarded. CAPANA. They lead him on, but ere he sleep in death, Thou too shalt hear him, and astonish'd, won, To pity yielding, wilt revoke this wish. [He makes signs that Alphonso should be brought before him, and ascends the throne. ALPHONSO. Cacique! What would'st thou with me? I have pray'd The God I worship not to visit on thee My innocent blood: and almost am resigned To quit this life, ere I have aught achieved Of all the mighty purpose of my soul. THELASCO. Thy coward spirit shrinks from death, it seems; We Indians welcome the repose he brings. ALPHONSO. It is the coward spirit, haughty Indian, That welcomes soft repose. But, fearless, I Would welcome dangers, toils, severest ills, In glory's cause; and would not lay me down, In all the pride, and strength of manhood, thus Unhonour'd and unwept! THELASCO. What call'st thou “glory?” Thousands of friendly Indians at thy feet Butcher'd by fraud, who on their shores received With songs and dances, and with garlands crown'd ye, As welcome guests? ALPHONSO. I was a stripling then: With horror marked the deed, and, in my heart, Vow'd I would ever be the Indian's friend! Nor have I stained this hand with Indian blood. Nay, oft my youthful pleadings have prevailed With one, whose sterner temper own'd no check, Save my poor prayers and tears. [Checking himself; then with energy. Yes, I would live! I feel such impulses within my breast, To mark my course by justice and by mercy, That I would live! Yet would exulting meet Death, linked with torture, if with glory linked! But thus to fall! CAPANA (to THELASCO aside). What wrong would'st thou avenge? Say, what his crime? THELASCO. That he was born a Spaniard. Was it not guilt enough in Spanish eyes, That we were Indian born? CAPANA. Not so with him. (To ALPHONSO with emotion). Were I, in weak compassion to thy youth, To give thee life! ALPHONSO (eagerly). And liberty! CAPANA. Thy liberty Were our destruction. Here thou must abide. ALPHONSO. Death has no terrors now! Command the rites. CAPANA. Thou would'st reveal the place of our retreat. ALPHONSO. What wilt thou trust if not the grateful heart? CAPANA. Nay, not thy heart: I but mistrust thy youth. In fellow feeling for a father's pain, Who has no son but thee—I could relent— ALPHONSO. Not to my father must thou give my life! Lead on—I will not practise on thy goodness. CAPANA. Not to thy father? 'Tis for him I feel! I too have lost an only son, and would not Another father should feel pangs like mine! ALPHONSO. Generous Capana! I will not deceive thee. Know, should'st thou give me life and liberty, It is Pedrarias' son thou bind'st to thee! CAPANA (with horror). The fell Pedrarias! THELASCO. Ha! Pedrarias, say'st thou? He who, insatiable of Indian blood, Clapping his gory palms, cheer'd on his dogs To trace our weary steps, and piecemeal tear Our quiv'ring flesh! Pedrarias! the destroyer! Beneath whose murderous stroke our fathers fell; Whose name our widows curse, and, but pronounced, Serves as a bugbear to their orphan babes! (To the attendants). Invent new tortures for Pedrarias' son! (The Indians rush forward with expressions of fury). AMAZILIA (breaking from the troop of damsels). Hold! hold! forbear! Ye know not what ye do! A God, far other than the God of Vengeance, Speaks by my simple tongue, and will be heard! Say, if revenge were sweet, as we are taught, Have not nine victims bled upon this altar? And who has yet seen good Capana smile? What son regains the father he has lost? What widow ceases to deplore her husband? The victims bled, while we, with giddy songs, Drown'd nature's voice! They bled—and all was o'er! In our lone cabins, when retired to rest, Say, were our sorrows soothed? [All hang their heads mournfully. I!—I will tell How noble spirits seek a sweet revenge! Give him a son who robb'd thee, chief, of thine, And see the humbled tyrant at thy feet Owe all to him he injured, and confess He learns of thee to serve the God he boasts! CAPANA (with great emotion). Thy words, my Amazilia, reach my soul, And shake its temper— [Striking his breast. Oh! I feel them here! ALPHONSO (aside). That voice! whose every tone my heart-strings answer With strong vibrations, sweet e'en to agony! Those charms! nor seen, nor imaged, till this hour! CAPANA (after a conflict, descending from his throne). Son of the man who desolates my country— Whom pity never touch'd—son of Pedrarias— I give thee life!—I give thee liberty! [Alphonso throws himself at his feet. Go to thy father. Say, an Indian chief, Whose people he has swept from off the earth, Whom he has doom'd to childless age, and sorrow, Low at his feet saw fell Pedrarias' son! Within his grasp each instrument of torture— And raised him thus, and press'd him to his bosom! [Raising and embracing him. ALPHONSO. Oh generous! generous! Thou—my more than father! CAPANA. Speak not Capana's name, nor e'er reveal The place of our retreat. [Alphonso is kneeling to swear. Nay, swear not, youth. It is impossible thou should'st betray us. ALPHONSO. Oh thou so noble! Thou, who serv'st so well The Christian's God! and thou! divinest maid! My guardian angel! Oh! I cannot speak My soul's wild tumult!—yes, the life ye give Devoted to your weal! I here abjure My country's cruel cause. Trust me, cacique, Nor prayers nor threats shall wring thy secret from me. A father's wrath were vain. But far, far otherwise His grateful thoughts will prompt. This deed will wake An Indian soul in great Pedrarias' breast; And sure, if benefits can e'er atone The wrongs ye've suffer'd, sure ye will be blest! Oh that he could alike restore thy son, And render joy for joy! CAPANA. Houaco fell With thousands of my butcher'd people, youth. Wake not the thought, while thus a something new, Awful, exalted, soothes my heart's long sorrow! 'Tis not a father's wrath will shake thy soul. Thou know'st him not. Beware his thanks! his blessings! Oh! let not these betray thy simple heart To break thy promise!—no, not if he swore To place me on the throne of all these realms, Himself my subject, and his arm my stay. Name not Capana, nor his place of rest; Not e'en to Indians, now the invader's slaves! I and my friends ask but to be forgotten. And should thy guileless youth, o'ermatch'd by fraud, And semblance fair, aught falter, look on this! [Taking an ornament from his own neck, and hanging it on Alphonso's. Think of Capana, and be firm again. ALPHONSO. Dear, honour'd pledge! that never but with life Shalt quit this bosom! [After gazing on it, and pressing it to his bosom. Visions of glorious deeds! Bright hopes that float confus'dly in my brain! Yes, I was born the instrument of mercy! My father now shall hail you men, and brothers; Shall sheathe the sword, and ye shall come anon, Won by the fame of his good deeds, shall come— CAPANA. Alas! thou dreamest, poor ingenuous youth! Depart!—My people shall conduct thy steps Among the yawning gulfs, and rocks stupendous That gird this valley, shutting out each eye, Save that of the all-searching, sacred sun. ALPHONSO. Yet ere I part, Cacique, oh! let me breathe A prayer for her, that unknown, heavenly maid, Who calls me to a new—a dearer life! [As he kneels and takes her hand. AMAZILIA. Away—away, youth!—See, Thelasco frowns. Oh fly!—farewell!—Yet if e'er aught of sorrow Visit thee, in that hour think of the maid Who soothed, erewhile, thy anguish; and who still, Oh! still would fain—yet never must again Or see—or hear thee-youth. [Appears overcome, and then with sudden transport. But thou wilt live! 'Twas all I ask'd! ALPHONSO. This life, thy gift, were vain, My guardian angel! vain were deeds of worth Not by thy smile approved!—and saidst thou never? That word of dreadful import—Oh! recall it, For till this hour, thou matchless excellence!— THELASCO. Why linger's thou? Art thou not free?—Away! And may each torture, vengeance can devise, Rack thy false soul if thou break faith with us! [Exit Alphonso on one side, escorted by a troop of Indians; Capana and Thelasco on the other. Amazilia and Laila remain. AMAZILIA (after gazing till ALPHONSO is out of sight). And is he gone? for ever gone, my Laila? And must I in this valley still remain, To breathe, to move, to sleep?—If haply sleep, Calm death-like sleep, will close my aching eyes, Wearied with watching through the live-long day Yon towering heights, upheaved by hate and envy. [Alphonso and his troop seen at a distance among the heights; when he disappears, she stretches her arms towards the heights. Ha! have ye shut him from my view for ever? Arm, arm your terrible brows with darker terrors, If ye would awe my soul, or bar the way To my fond wishes. LAILA. Said'st thou thy fond wishes? My Amazilia, wert thou not betrothed To brave Houaco? AMAZILIA. I have wept Houaco, In battle slain. LAILA. And shall another fill The heart where brave Houaco wont to reign? AMAZILIA. What have the dead to do with this sad heart? I held Houaco dear from earliest years, For that he would prevent my childish wishes, And still was blest if Amazilia smiled. It was a thing of habit, as we prize Whate'er may to our pleasure minister. It did not fill the heart, but I was tranquil, And nothing knew of these high hopes, these thoughts Aspiring, restless, wild, tumultuous, That make our pent up vale, our abject life, Our brutish ignorance, and slothful ease, So irksome to my soul. LAILA. Oh, Amazilia! 'Tis a distemper'd fancy thus misleads thee. Are we not taught that disembodied spirits, In sweet perpetual change of song and dance, Float joyous; or in flowery meads recline, Now slumbering, or now waking to light labours That make repose more grateful?—Say, my friend, Live we not even so? and is this irksome? AMAZILIA. Yes, to a mind that would aspire so high As fellowship of thought with him—that would With him share toil and danger!—Yes, to one Who would with him enlighten,—bless a people,— And, dying, leave a name that might not perish! Come with me to our cabin—thou shalt learn All that thy friend would wish, would hope, would dare. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. The Governor's Palace at Panama. Pedrarias and his Court at a grand feast, Alphonso by his father's side. Shouts are heard as from the people rejoicing around the palace. The guests rise with goblets in their hands to welcome Alphonso. PEDRARIAS. Thanks, thanks, my friends and fellows in renown! That ye who shared my dangers and my toils, Should, with such heartfelt brotherhood, partake My private joy, to me is doubly grateful: Our infant state on these fair-conquer'd shores Thrives but by brotherhood thus firmly knit. What yet remains were as a healthful pastime To banish sluggish ease. 'Tis but to sweep, From these our fruitful plains, the native hordes That still infest them.—What says my Alphonso? ALPHONSO (shudders, and starts from his reverie). My honour'd father! in this o'ercharged breast A thousand feelings strive for mastery. I would control my wayward thoughts, and worthily Express my thanks to these our noble friends. [He rises, and bows with a goblet in his hand. LOPEZ. The holiday thy glad return has made In Panama, were idle revelry, Unworthy of its cause, if mark'd alone By clamorous shouts. A nobler game, Alphonso, Should seal our joys with blood! PEDRARIAS. It is well said! [The shouts without are repeated. Don Gusman, bear our oft repeated thanks Once more to the glad throng without, I pray; Go thou and give them fair dismissal.—Now [Rising. In this last cup, my friends, I pledge you all. [All rise and drink. 'Twere tedious to repeat my grateful thoughts. The evening closes fast; and, ere I rest, The cares of state demand a thoughtful hour. [They begin to move off with ceremony, Pedrarias comes forward. Conduct Don Lopez to the gate, my son. [Exeunt Alphonso and Lopez. No longer shall your boiling spirits chafe Within these walls, my friends. The means are mine To trace the savage hordes to their last refuge. Visions of conquest on your slumbers wait! My valiant Gomez, Carlos, and Alvarez; And you—and you—my brave companions all! Pass without compliment.—Sweet rest attend you! [Exeunt with proper ceremony. Pedrarias remains in deep thought. Gusman returns. GUSMAN. Methinks, my lord, while with such general joy All Panama has welcomed Don Alphonso, Some secret care has prey'd upon your mind, Checking the tide of a fond father's gladness. PEDRARIAS. True, Gusman, true; greatness has heavy cares. Those savages, who rather than submit To slavery, would sullen die despairing— Say, have they suffer'd torture? GUSMAN. No, my lord. Pardon that still the rebel natives live. Tortures avail'd us nothing.—We desisited. PEDRARIAS. Perdition! shall they live who brave my power? Why am I not obey'd? GUSMAN. If vanquish'd foes We daily slaughter thus, where shall we find The slaves required to dig the precious ore? PEDRARIAS. Ye have been slack. New tortures shall compel These slothful slaves to ply their sun-bask'd limbs For conquerors.—Let them be rack'd—Away! GUSMAN. My lord, 'tis useless now. Zamori's voice, Their fellow slave, Zamori's, has prevail'd. PEDRARIAS. Zamori, say'st thou? GUSMAN. Yes, with earnest prayer, He sued to parley with his countrymen, Unheard by me. PEDRARIAS. Thou didst not sure consent? GUSMAN. I did, my lord. But was not distant far, And something caught of what Zamori urged. He spoke of patience—of some distant hope— A hope full sweet—some good inestimable, However dearly purchased. There I lost His farther speech among the mingling sounds. Their stubborn spirits on the instant yielded: They wept—they gnash'd their teeth, when, sudden, he First snatch'd a mattock, and with lusty stroke Open'd the soil. All follow'd eagerly, With bleeding wounds inflicted by the lash, Or limbs disjointed by the rack.—'Twas piteous! PEDRARIAS. Gusman, thou wert of my all-conquering band. I little thought to see thee heave the sigh For these dull clods of earth.—Thou mov'st my scorn. [He paces the stage, ruminating. And would Zamori move his brutish fellows To serve their master? What might be his motive? Proud, uncomplaining, melancholy, stern, I oft have mark'd this Indian's lofty mien; And (for his carriage still rebuked my spirit) I added e'en indignity to torture. As rocks that from the daily whelming tide Rear the unalter'd brow, he bore himself! It was his firmness taught them to resist, And is it he who schools them now to yield? GUSMAN. My lord, released of late from servile chains, Nearer your person he has been advanced. This gentler treatment in a noble nature— PEDRARIAS. 'Twas but the nearer to observe his bearing. There is a savage greatness in Zamori That should awake suspicion. Much he may, Swaying the minds of all his fellows thus. GUSMAN. Indeed, my lord, the slave has well deserved. He will be faithful. PEDRARIAS. Faithful he shall be! My eye is on him.—But far other cares Engross my mind.—Hast thou observed Alphonso? Can a few weeks have changed his very nature? Musing he sits, and frowns as fancy works, Or if I question him, he speaks as though Each word involved some mighty consequence. GUSMAN. Perchance the thought of those who shared his sports, And perish'd 'mong the desert wilds, may still Hang heavy on his heart, and cloud his brow. PEDRARIAS. I know not what to think, nor what to fear. —But thou retire, my friend, and charge Zamori To seek my son, Alphonso, ere he rest, And say I wait his coming in my chamber. His father there would give the rein to nature, And breathe a blessing on his son restored. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The Governor's Ante-chamber. Alphonso and Houaco enter in conversation. ALPHONSO. Thee, most of all, Zamori, save my father, I joy to see again. Yet thou alone Hast not once deign'd to smile on my return. HOUACO. Joy is a stranger to Zamori's breast! [Retiring slowly, and fixing his eyes on Alphonso, who looks kindly after him, then advances towards his father, who comes from an inner apartment. PEDRARIAS. My son! my loved Alphonso! shall I own That I am almost weary of these loud Tumultuous rejoicings? though for thee, And thy return glad Panama thus maddens. Nay, thou art weary too, and spiritless. ALPHONSO. The joy to see my father and my friends Has something of a tender, serious cast, That rather might to silent tears incline Than these wild revellings. PEDRARIAS. Were tenderness The character of my Alphonso's joy, He were not thus dark, guarded, hesitating, Whene'er a father's fondness prompts th' inquiry Of all that has befallen. ALPHONSO. I will tell all That may import a father. How the chase Of the swift lama, and the fiercer bison, Led on thy thoughtless son, and his young band, The partners of his sports, through trackless woods, O'er mountains, rocks, and wilds, till, lost their course, O'erspent with toil, dispersed, a prey to famine— The natives of those unknown deserts found, Surrounded, seized, and bound thy son. PEDRARIAS. Bound thee! Pedrarias' son bound by these savages! Ha! they shall dearly rue— ALPHONSO. Nay, shall they rue The noble pity lavish'd upon one Of the fell race— (Aside, checking himself.) But silence, my rash tongue! (Aloud.) Their generous leader knew thy son, and loosed him! He raised, embraced me, bade me say from him— [Again checking himself. His looks strike terror!—The good Indian's words Would but embitter whom they might not move To emulate his gentle deeds. PEDRARIAS. E'en now Mark how your speech is broken—how you start, And shift, as 'twere some guilty thought appall'd you. Their chief?—say, was he a Cacique? (Aside. Could he, The bold, the patient, persevering savage, Capana?—Would the fierce Thelasco do it? No, no. It must be one who knows my power, And thus would win my favour; but not one Who has so felt that power who would release him. (Aloud.) Where lurks the savage chieftain with his horde? Whence com'st thou? ALPHONSO. From among a generous race! Nature's free children! By her special love Guarded from ill! Blest in their simpleness, To avarice they hold no fatal lure! Rich but in worth! Oh, sacred be their peace! [With joy and tenderness. Thou didst lament a son, and he is here! Is't not enough thy once loved son restored? [Throwing himself on his bosom. PEDRARIAS (putting him from him coldly). 'Tis not enough, if thus my son return Alter'd, estranged,—haply with savages Leagued to betray— ALPHONSO. Oh, check thy cruel speech; Or if thou canst suspect my loyalty, Treat me as one attainted; fasten fetters On thy son's guiltless limbs, within a dungeon Cast him, and prefer thy accusation. What is my crime, my father? PEDRARIAS. Disobedience To the vicegerent of thy king, young man, And to thy father. ALPHONSO. Load me then with chains— Proclaim me traitor—send me thus to Spain: Were it not better to be falsely branded, Than in my secret bosom feel the sting He needs must feel who can indeed betray? PEDRARIAS. Ungracious boy! and is it thus I find thee? What tortures shall my just revenge devise For him who robs me of my son?—The savage! ALPHONSO. Is he the savage who feels others' woes? Who breaks the captive's bonds, and bids him live? Is he the savage who forgives his foe, And renders good for ill?—Pardon, methinks He is the Christian! PEDRARIAS (confounded). (Aside). I have gone too far— I will try gentler means. (Aloud.) A Christian, say'st thou? And has thy friend embraced our holy faith? ALPHONSO. The Christian's deeds are his. PEDRARIAS. Then as a brother I'll fold the generous Christian to my bosom! I was too warm, my child; my spirit brook'd not A heathen should have held my son in bondage, Nor own'd the debt of gratitude to one Bending at idols' shrines, with rites abhorr'd. ALPHONSO. Pardon, my father, if I have offended. Oh! now I feel I am thy son again, For now thou look'st on thy Alphonso kindly, As in those days of childish happiness, When, from the heavy cares of state retired, Thou would'st assume the boy, and share his sports. PEDRARIAS. Oh yes; and I would thank the Indian chief That he restores my boy, as in those days, Simple, ingenuous, obedient, duteous! ALPHONSO (earnestly). And art thou grateful to the gentle Indian? And would'st thou prove it? PEDRARIAS (with impatience). Yes, I would—I would. ALPHONSO (taking his hand affectionately). He and his friends ask but to be forgotten. PEDRARIAS. Nay, nay; thou would'st not that my miser heart, Thankless and cold, should hoard its selfish joy. Come, boy, come, guide me to the Indian Christian, And let me lock him in a friend's embrace; The debt were painful should I nought dispense Of good, for all the mighty good received. ALPHONSO. And what canst thou dispense to one above The idle wants of pride? A little maize Feasts him, the dimpling brook allays his thirst; The palm-tree bowers his bed of reeds, and forms His canopy of state; the bank beneath, Gorgeous in nature's 'broidery, his throne; His empire, in a people's love, is vast: The God he serves—with rites however rude— A God of Mercy, and how truly serves, Thou know'st. PEDRARIAS (impatient). 'Tis well—yet nam'st thou not thy friend,— Thy Christian friend,—nor tell'st me his abode. ALPHONSO. I cannot. I beseech you, urge it not. PEDRARIAS (resuming his anger). By thy allegiance, I command thee tell me. ALPHONSO (with firmness). I owe my king th' allegiance of a subject: My services are his—my sword—my life! But there's a secret rectitude within, Stamp of the soul free-born, that will not own Control from aught of earth; nor can a king Command me that I act the villain's part. PEDRARIAS. Ha! dost thou brave me thus in every way? Leagued with the rebel natives to defy My delegated power! with impious foot Trampling on nature's first, most sacred tie Of filial duty! [Paces the stage in great agitation. Yes—how I have loved thee Thou know'st, ungrateful boy!—but I—I, too, Alphonso, can be firm. If, on the moment, Thou answer not to all I shall demand, I banish thee for ever from my sight, Doom thee to wander, with a father's curse, Among the savages thou hast preferr'd To him who gave thee being. ALPHONSO. Oh, forbear! Reverse the dreadful sentence thou hast pass'd, Or take my worthless life. PEDRARIAS. Nor fancy thou I cannot hunt the natives down, and sweep them From earth, if thou assist not. Would'st attempt To shield the pensile warbler from the swoop Of the huge condor that has mark'd his prey? Thou know'st what I can do when simply led, Like other men, by thirst of fair renown, But hast not mark'd Pedrarias' dread career When urged by sense of wrong—by strong revenge! Hadst thou but trusted to a father's heart, It might have pleaded for the man who spared thee. Look to it now.—Thou—thou would'st have it so. 'T will soon be proved who is most powerful, Or thou to save—or I to crush a foe. [Going. ALPHONSO (clinging to him). Oh stay! my father, stay!—Behold my breast— Yes, let my blood atone his fault who spared it, And thus made gratitude a crime. PEDRARIAS. Away! Thou know'st how best to prove thy gratitude: It rests with thee to save thy friend. ALPHONSO. Then hear me. But first—Oh, swear thou never wilt molest His peace, nor seek his place of refuge—Swear— [Aside, perceiving Capana's token. What am I doing?—Come, thou sacred pledge, Rouse, in this trying hour, my sinking courage! [Aloud, with resignation and firmness. I am resolved, and bow me to my fate! Farewell, my father! PEDRARIAS. Then my curse be on thee! Fly an offended father's presence, rebel! Hide thee in caverns, far from haunt of man, Or, in dread loneliness, bleak deserts roam, Where hope is dead, where pity may not find thee, Where sound of life is none, nor answering echo Gives back thy groan in horrid fellowship! Thy father's heart for ever casts thee off! ALPHONSO. Guiltless I go.—But when destruction follows, As sure it will, e'en thou, though late, may'st prove A father's anger cannot last for ever. [Exit. PEDRARIAS. Away! nor think to lull my just resentment. Foil'd in the object of my glorious labours— Braved by my child—Told by a beardless boy The brutish savage was the better Christian!— Yes, he shall drain repentance' bitter cup E'en to the dregs!—Away, parental weakness! I will know where the native hordes are hived. Ten years of bloodshed and of toil are lost, If in their fastnesses secure they breed, And swarm forth on us.—But the means— (Calls off the stage). Hoa, Gusman! Enter Gusman. GUSMAN. My gracious lord, what has befallen? Alphonso In strange disorder— PEDRARIAS. From my presence banish'd, Name not the traitor. GUSMAN. Has he not declared Where rally from defeat the natives? PEDRARIAS. No; With obstinate defiance he persisted, Nor would betray his friend, the gentle Indian, The Christian, as it seems.—Ha, baffled thus! I have it, Gusman—His pretended faith Shall prove their bane.—Banish'd, he sure will seek His Indian friends—My spies are skill'd— GUSMAN. Yet think, My lord; each danger, he so late has 'scaped, Besets Alphonso in his pathless way, And doubly foil'd if aught of ill befall. PEDRARIAS. Ha! doubly foil'd?—'tis true.—But how secure From peril—and yet free his will perverse To follow, unsuspecting of the snare?— GUSMAN. The slave Zamori; you have proved him faithful; He has done you service since his chains were lighten'd. PEDRARIAS. Yes, as the native tames the baneful snake, And bids him wind in glossy folds, around His limbs, innocuous, extracting first The tooth beneath whose fang the poison lurks— So to my service the proud slave's subdued. GUSMAN. And more; your son affects him, for that once From death Zamori rescued him, unconscious; He may again avert impending ill— PEDRARIAS. And guide his steps; for, led by nature's self, The slave will find, instinctive, their retreat. His very love will give them to my vengeance! Thanks—thanks, my friend! I hold Zamori's faith, For well he knows that thousands of his fellows Will bleed if he but swerve. 'Twill do—'twill do. Go, bear my will to my disloyal son; With hopes of future favour win Zamori— Nay, I, myself, will school him to my purpose. And, mark me—seek thou Perez—send him hither. To-morrow's sun shall find my plans matured For future conquest, and for future glory. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A Court of the Palace. A distant View of the Bay—Evening; the Moon rising. Houaco enters slowly from one side. HOUACO. His wond'rous tale has roused each recollection That bids me live, while it makes life so bitter. Oh, my poor countrymen! and ye, dear objects Of my sad, secret thoughts!—No, nothing—nothing,— Can ever slacken memory's strong hold! [Alphonso enters from the other side, with folded arms, and lost in thought. Alone! I will accost him.—Don Alphonso! ALPHONSO (starting from his reverie). Approach, Zamori, for thou art an Indian. Haply the sight of thee may soothe my soul! I am o'erwhelm'd by a stern father's curse For keeping faith with men like thee, Zamori. HOUACO. By men like me faith given ne'er was broken. ALPHONSO. My faith was given to one so great!—so noble! To one, whose spirit seems an emanation From him whom darkling he adores unknown! Yes, given to one, whose gentle sway of love Is stamp'd by Mercy, and upheld by Justice! HOUACO. Yet Justice upon Mercy's bosom slept When the wrong'd Indian held Pedrarias' son, And loosed his bonds! (With suspicion). If so indeed it were? ALPHONSO. Oh! that I might disburthen my full heart In any human breast!—I would choose thine. Ere I departed from my father's court, Thou know'st I woo'd thy friendship, though in vain. HOUACO. I am a slave—the slave can never be The freeman's friend. ALPHONSO. Not so. Can twisted bands, Or fire-wrought iron, though they bind the limbs, Subdue the free-born spirit?—Thou art noble. I would no other friend. HOUACO. I am a native Of this fair land, that reeks beneath my foot With the dear blood of those I wont to love, Shed by thy father's unrelenting hand! And shall my soul communion hold with thine? ALPHONSO. Thou didst, with friendship's own unshrinking hand, Unwreathe the hooded snake that round my neck Had wound him in my sleep! HOUACO. 'Tis true, I did. But first it chanced, when, as unskill'd, I strain'd The servile oar, with muscles all unused To the strait tension, and the rapid current Of Oronoko seem'd to mock my toil, Thy father bade his creatures urge with stripes My fainting strength— (Aside, mastering himself). Be still—be still, my soul! Thou took'st my place, as 'twere in youthful sport, And lustily didst buffet with the stream, While on the oar, amid thy playful speech, Fell pity's tear! ALPHONSO. Then why refuse, Zamori, The fellowship I court?—'tis nature's self Draws kindred spirits, and Pedrarias' son Is dear to one like thee—a noble Indian! [Takes Capana's token from his bosom, and gazes on it. Thou sacred pledge! HOUACO. That pledge! or do I dream? That sacred pledge! [Seizing Alphonso roughly. Speak—speak, Alphonso, speak! Or I will tear the secret from thy soul!— Did he who gave thee liberty, give that? ALPHONSO (putting him away haughtily). Must thou, too, question with imperious tone? I have withstood a father's sacred claim! (Aside.) “Breathe not the sounds even in an Indian's ear,” He said.—I must mislead his eagerness. (Aloud.) I found the bauble! HOUACO (with trembling anxiety). And a mangled corse Beside it! or, haply, scatter'd bones, that bleach'd In the rude blast!—Oh! on my knees, I beg, Tell me the fatal spot, that I may gather Each honour'd relic to my broken heart! ALPHONSO (kindly). Pardon, Zamori, that I may not tell By what dear right this valued pledge is mine. HOUACO (shuddering with horror). Ha! thou hast slain him, and dost bear his spoils! ALPHONSO (with delight). No, no.—He lives! he lives, who gave me this. But wherefore dost thou strain thy eyeballs thus, With short convulsive heavings?—Who art thou? HOUACO (recollecting himself). I am thy father's slave. ALPHONSO. But ere these chains, (My heart prophetic throbs) who wert thou?—say! HOUACO. This bosom holds its secret too. ALPHONSO. Oh, no! It holds no secret mine does not partake! Nature's strong impulse bids me clasp thy hand, And all thee—brave Houaco! HOUACO (in ecstacy). Yes, 'twas he! 'Twas he himself who spared thy life! ALPHONSO. Thy father, Capana, gave me life and liberty, Thou brother of my love! and gave me this. [They embrace. He bade me not reveal to living being The place of his retreat. His son, he thought, Was number'd with the dead. HOUACO. And so he is! The slave Zamori lives. ALPHONSO. Capana's son Thou art, and shalt be!—Yes, I fly to claim The free enlargement of Capana's son! HOUACO. Oh stay, rash youth! ALPHONSO. Alas! the sudden joy Had blotted from my thought all former ill; My vow—my cruel father's anger—all! By gratitude debarr'd from grateful deeds, Oh, am I not, Houaco, most accursed? To know my benefactor wastes his days In sorrow, and thus,—thus to hold the means Of full requital!—hold his happiness As 'twere within my grasp, nor dare dispense it! HOUACO. Young man, misfortune has not school'd thy spirit, Unmoved, to suffer; to the present senseless, Thy very being forward borne, with purpose Intense, deep fix'd, till years bring on the hour Of retribution, great as was the wrong. ALPHONSO. Rear'd in gay luxury, my friend, my youth Sought but the pleasures of the passing day; But when I mark'd thy calm, disdainful, brow Smiling in tortures, felt how great the conquer'd!— The conquerors how little!—then my mind Aspired to emulate the man I honour'd. That man the son of him who set me free— To free him be henceforth my soul's strong purpose! By heaven, it cannot be, that he, the father Who to my infant prayer would yield with smiles, Should now relentless— HOUACO. If he could relent, Capana must not look on these gall'd wrists: He has wept me, dead—he must not find new tears To weep his son enslaved! ALPHONSO (eagerly). A slave no longer! For thou with me from Panama shalt fly, Escaped from chains— HOUACO. Might I escape, I would not. The tyrant's vengeance would with tenfold fury Fall on my fellow-captives!—No, I would not; For while I stand between Pedrarias' rigour And the poor suffering few his rage has spared, Methinks it is a last sad duty, owed By lost Houaco to his father's people! ALPHONSO. Thou noble spirit!—Then 'tis mine alone To seek Capana, and with him concert To break thy bondage. Thou, meantime, my friend, Wear this, it will recall his honour'd image. [Giving him Capana's token. HOUACO. No, wear it thou! for no remembrancer Houaco needs of his poor wandering father, His butcher'd people, and his wasted country! Enter Gusman. GUSMAN. I have sought thee, Don Alphonso, through the palace, The bearer of thy father's will. [Houaco retiring. Nay, stay, Zamori! thy good services are graced: 'Tis thine to follow on Alphonso's fortunes. Yet one night more within these walls ye rest: Ere dawn, together— ALPHONSO. Together, Gusman! Thanks, My gracious father! e'en in anger kind! (To Houaco). The heavens thou see'st on holy friendship smile! Come then, thou brother of my heart! The heights Upheaved before us frown in untamed grandeur, Our ample heritage! th' o'erarching skies Our mutual roof! for bolts and bars, our faith! Then not in lonely deserts shall we roam; For, with a friend, the wilderness is peopled! Nor in throng'd cities, nor in soul-less courts, Is known the full communion of free thought Man finds with man in native liberty! [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. Wild Mountain Scenery. A Palm-tree in the Foreground, with Fruits placed beneath it. Alphonso, Houaco. HOUACO. Oh should Pedrarias trace our steps, my friend! The very thought strikes with a death-like chill Through all my frame, killing each thought of joy! Thy father's looks and words when he dismiss'd me, Guarded—mysterious! No, 'twas not blind rage That banish'd a loved son, so lately found! ALPHONSO. Thy boding mind too idly shapes vain terrors. Have we not, wandering thus, pursued a course Most intricate? It were impossible! Ravaged by conquest, the unpeopled plains Are silent! Though dark-brow'd, these rocks are friendly: Nor hostile e'en the beasts of prey, shunning Our aspect strange with disregard, not fear. There is no guile in the primeval haunts Of nature, still inviolate by man. Then think, these heights o'erpass'd, how will thy heart Bound at the sight of the green vale!—thy father! And her thou lov'st—thy Amazilia! there— (Aside) Yes, I will speak her name without emotion. She is my friend's! Away the impious thought That would repine! HOUACO. Hast thou e'er lov'd, Alphonso? Oh no! or thou hadst known love's doubts—love's fears— That war with joy, unwonted inmate here! And then to meet my Amazilia's eye, Ere noble deeds efface the blasting traces Deep stamp'd by slavery!—this is bitterness! ALPHONSO. Be cheer'd, and from thy fancy drive these thoughts, For much they wrong thy gentle Amazilia. HOUACO. Thanks—I will strive to think so. Now resume we Our search for the deep-rifted rock which gives Admittance to the valley. Friend, we hold, That on these awful heights, Illapa stores His vengeful thunders. The stern God himself Rent the eternal barrier to admit A fugitive cacique! ALPHONSO. 'Tis strange, Houaco, We should have sought in vain the deep ravine Since early dawn, and now the sun is high. Methought I noted each o'erhanging cliff, And yawning gulf, as forth your people led me. HOUACO. 'T were best despatch that thou the eastern ridge, And I the western, traverse. ALPHONSO. 'Tis well thought. Here part we then awhile—and here ere noon Meet we again. Beneath this palm, the fruits Thou, provident, hast gather'd as we journey'd, Shall furnish forth our banquet. HOUACO (going). Warily Observe thy course. ALPHONSO. And do thou call, my friend, From time to time, that we may not be sunder'd. [Exeunt severally. Enter Amazilia and Laila. AMAZILIA. Oh, Laila! I must lay me down and die, Such weariness and faintness overcome me: My trembling limbs refuse to bear their burthen. LAILA. Why didst thou press our little store on me, Refusing still to share it? Why preserve Thy Laila, if to live bereft of thee? Alas! our happy vale! Why, Amazilia, Could'st thou no longer taste our blameless life? AMAZILIA. Go ask the bird, why from his wicker prison, Where unsought plenty courts him ere he hunger, He seeks to escape. LAILA. A prison? Amazilia. AMAZILIA. Oh, 'twas a narrow prison to my mind! My thoughts would range, as the young Christian led, Beyond the bounds of timid ignorance. LAILA. And dost thou call it ignorance to enjoy The season's gifts in peace and innocence, Secure from the fierce storms that wreck'd our country? How lovely Nature in her gentler mood! It is her pearly dew, her noiseless shower, That rear the maize, that swell the cocoa's nut, Which with untoil'd and careless hand we crop. AMAZILIA. Dull, vacant ease—insipid sameness—Laila! That wake not glowing thoughts, nor wing the soul To soar above the brute creation round us. The hurricane, majestic in its terrors, Resistless sweeps our orange groves away, And marks its awful course by desolation; Yet roused, as we contemplate power so vast, We bend before the spirit of the storm In worship, we forget to pay, when nature Serenely smiles around. But I would rest. LAILA. Beneath this tree the bank is clothed with moss: Here find repose, while I, among the thickets, Search for cool berries, or a gushing spring: Ere long I will return. See! rest thy head Against the shaded trunk: now, art thou well? Kind slumbers visit thee! I will not tarry. [Exit. AMAZILIA (alone). Alas! I cannot rest. My fever'd brain! Oh that my Laila may but find a spring! To lave my burning hands were some relief. I am not well here. Yonder palm, methinks, Affords more ample shade. [She removes to the palm. What see I here? Bananas, yams, and juicy gourds!—Ho, Laila! Whence comes this boon? Ah! I bethink me now, Alphonso said, the God of Mercy watched O'er all his creatures! not a sparrow fell Without his bidding! [Kneeling. Oh! Alphonso's God! Accept my thanks! Enter Alphonso. ALPHONSO. I heard a soft complaining— This way the sound! Eternal Providence! What angel form before me kneels? 'tis she! AMAZILIA (starting up). Is it an airy vision?—or art thou The god, whose hand beneficent has placed These fruits before me, lest I sink in death? [She staggers towards him, and sinks into his arms. ALPHONSO. Help, heaven! My Amazilia's passing soul Flutters on her pale lip!—So fair! so sacred! Perforce these guilty arms— [She half recovers, and gazes on him. She breathes! she lives! Why dost thou gaze so wildly? 'tis Alphonso! AMAZILIA (wildly). It cannot be that thou of kindred earth Wast framed! Thou hast the power to save from death! Thou hast watched o'er me! Thou, unseen, hast led My steps o'er yon proud heights that barr'd my way! Thy air—thy voice—all—all! betray thy nature! ALPHONSO. Oh be more calm! These wand'ring thoughts affright me. AMAZILIA (more wildly). Thou art the spirit that wings the middle air In gentle breezes; with assuasive hand Turning aside Illapa's The God of Thunder. angry bolt, That it may rive the haughty mountain's crest, And spare the lowly vale! ALPHONSO. When last I saw thee, Thou hadst abjured these idols, false, and vain, Offspring of fear and ignorance! AMAZILIA (more impassioned). Then, sure, Thou art the hope, the love, the gentle pity Thou told'st me of, embodied in a form Not of earth's mould! Thus kneeling— [As she is about to kneel he raises her. ALPHONSO. Rise! oh rise! I shudder at thy error, Amazilia. Am I not he whose life thy goodness saved? Should I not rather kneel to thee?—and yet Thou see'st I bend not! Said'st thou not thyself, When pleading for me to the good cacique, That by thy lips the God of Mercy spoke? And might not he, by my unconscious hand, Before thee place these fruits? Human am I, And frail. Too well I feel it! (aside). But say—Why To these rude wilds, and to their ruder tenants, (If such there be), thy virtue all unguarded, And high estate, thou—inconsiderate!— Commit'st thy charms? AMAZILIA. And have I, then, done ill? ALPHONSO. That were not possible! but—thy companions? AMAZILIA. I left the valley with no friend save Laila. ALPHONSO. Oh heaven! and wherefore didst thou so? rash maid! AMAZILIA. It was grown hateful, youth. Within my breast Something still whisper'd, if I could escape, I should once more—I pray you, pardon me! ALPHONSO. Dear Amazilia!—what is thy offence? AMAZILIA. Said'st thou not “dear?” Oh then thou wilt forgive! ALPHONSO. What is this mystery? I pray thee speak! Can Amazilia e'er offend Alphonso? Did she not soothe his sufferings? save his life? Oh prove the gratitude too big for utterance! AMAZILIA. And wilt thou grant whatever I may ask? ALPHONSO. I will! for Amazilia cannot ask What purest angels would not smiling grant! [She throws herself at his feet with the wildest enthusiasm. AMAZILIA. Then at thy feet I humbly ask this boon— That I may follow thee through toil, through danger, In winter's storms, beneath the burning skies, In sickness tend thee—when thou sorrowest, weep; Lull thee when weary, o'er thy slumber watch, Wait on thy every look—from thy lips learn Of heavenly wisdom, goodness infinite; And soar in thought as much above the sphere That once was mine, as when in night's hush'd hour I hung upon thy words! ALPHONSO. No more! no more! Oh, let me fly for ever from thy sight, Thou fair enthusiast! ere a guilty thought Pollute my faith, and wrong my chosen friend! AMAZILIA. Whom should'st thou wrong? I am an orphan, free From every tie. ALPHONSO (in an agony). Oh no! thou art not free! HOUACO (at a distance). Hoa! Alphonso! ALPHONSO. That voice! Heard'st thou that voice? I do beseech thee, generous Amazilia! If thou would'st save me from despair, from death, Forget the words that now have pass'd thy lips! These shapings of distemper'd fancy, trust me, Thy better reason will disown. Oh yes, Thou art o'er wearied! [Takes her hand as she seems violently agitated. This hand burns with fever! HOUACO (nearer). Alphonso! hoa! ALPHONSO. It is Houaco's voice! Capana's son! my bosom's chosen brother! Houaco! hoa!—I pray thee be composed. Enter Houaco. Amazilia faints, and Houaco stands thunderstruck. HOUACO. Ha! Amazilia in Alphonso's arms! ALPHONSO (supporting AMAZILIA). Approach, Houaco! I have found thy spouse Thus spent with travel, and with hunger fainting. Support her thou, and I will bring the fruits, Our only store. [Houaco receives her from Alphonso. HOUACO. Oh! my loved Amazilia! And can it be thy heavenly form these arms, These trembling, these poor, chain-gall'd, arms, support? And shall thy opening eyes behold a slave, In thy youth's promised husband, Amazilia! Wilt thou not spurn him? [She opens her eyes languidly, looks at him, and feebly struggles to get from him. Shuddering she would break From my unworthy hold!—Come thou, Alphonso! For e'en in death she shrinks from my embrace. Do thou support her. [Alphonso supports, and Houaco retires dejectedly. AMAZILIA (opening her eyes, and finding herself in his arms). I am free, Alphonso! O'er the wide world I may at pleasure roam: Who, who shall stay me? ALPHONSO. Oh! her thoughts are fever'd! These idle words are fancy's sickly coinage! AMAZILIA. Methinks, indeed, I am about to die! Then wherefore aught disguise of all I feel? Houaco, I rejoice that thou still livest! Thy presence will restore Capana's peace. Oh may ye both be bless'd! but 'tis not given To wretched Amazilia, if she live, To witness, or to share, your happiness! HOUACO. I knew the high-born maid would thus reject One who had been a slave! AMAZILIA. Nay, dear Houaco, Think not thou art degraded in my eyes By any chance of war. No, dearer far Thy sufferings have made thee; and my heart Will ever own for thee a sister's love. HOUACO. “A sister's love!” Why should'st thou say “a sister's?” Thou art betroth'd to me! Canst thou not promise The love a wife should know? AMAZILIA. My wayward fate Will have it otherwise. HOUACO. What mean these words? AMAZILIA (with solemnity). I own the Christian's God! the God of Mercy! Farewell, Houaco! I am dead to thee. [Going. HOUACO (stopping her). And dost thou fly me?—Whither, Amazilia? AMAZILIA (with enthusiasm). I follow where Alphonso leads the way! ALPHONSO (embarrassed). No, she is not herself. Houaco, hear me! HOUACO (after a pause of contending passion). This is no forgery of sickly fancy! I see,—too clearly see! Fool that I was To be thus duped! thus led in triumph hither! Thou art a Spaniard! son of fell Pedrarias! And thou canst smile, and flatter, to betray. I was thy father's slave by right of war, But did consent to fellowship with thee: Nor half so low Pedrarias' slave I hold As false Alphonso's friend! ALPHONSO (aside, with effort). (Down, down my rage! Capana's son is to Alphonso sacred!) No, by my soul, 'tis false! 'tis false, Houaco, What thou hast thought. My faith to thee is pure. All lovely as she is, she shall be thine! And never, never— AMAZILIA. Hold! Alphonso, hold! I never can be thine—too well I know it! My fancy had not yet distinctly formed The daring thought! but following thee, it seem'd I sought the unknown God, whose virtuous lore Thy heaven-instructed lips were wont to teach! Thou may'st refuse my proffered service, youth; But canst not give me to another. Free I am—and will be! HOUACO. Nay, it is well done, Pedrarias' son! to steal from me her faith, And now to spurn the maid! ALPHONSO. To spurn her?—No. But to my friend! but to Capana's son! To yield what most I prize beneath heaven's cope! AMAZILIA. “To yield me,” haughty youth! E'en thus our people Will barter for the tame, domestic Lama, Gay colour'd shells, or cocoa nuts, her price. (Turning to Houaco). Of noble blood—my father a cacique, Great as thine own, Houaco! Liberty, As thine, my birthright! My free-will I claim, And evermore in solitude will dwell, Secure, self-guarded! For I know to charm The baneful snake—the properties have learnt Of herbs salubrious; and the mystic song Is mine, to lull the powers of ill that haunt The mountain caverns, and in storms disport. (To Alphonso). Farewell, Alphonso! proud as thou, no mate, No loved companion shall this bosom own! My fellowship be with the answering rocks; The winds my counsellors—for who shall share Those thoughts—those hopes—which thou, youth, thou alone Who didst inspire—could'st, worthily, partake? [She sinks exhausted on the bank;Alphonso, terrified, bends anxiously over her. Enter Laila hastily. LAILA. My Amazilia, I have found a brook; The clustering cessus, and papaia fruit— (Seeing Houaco) But oh! ye pitying heavens! or do I dream, Or do I bow to great Capana's son? HOUACO (putting her away). Leave me, oh leave me! I am nothing, Laila! Haste thee, kind maid, and aid thy sinking friend. Ah see! she faints!—and yet thy services May be, as mine, ungrateful—for behold! The wily Spaniard o'er his victim bends! [Laila hastens to her assistance, and is anxiously employed about her with Alphonso, without observing Houaco. And are there ills Houaco has not felt? What torture new, and strange, and fierce, is this? Have I not baffled all Pedrarias' rage, And smiled upon him,—as I had been at ease? When pierced with wounds, fainting with loss of blood, While swam all nature in my glassy eyes, And, on my brow, death hung his last cold dews, My spirit still held on its even course! When torn with stripes, (the son of a cacique!) I bore myself as though I felt them not! I wearied out my torturers' cruelty, And thought this iron breast was proof against The touch of human ill. But this! oh! this Awakes a pang so keen! it strikes so home! On chords so tender of the heart! on chords That neither fortitude nor manhood tempers To bear a touch so rude! [After watching them with violent emotion. The smooth-tongued villain! He shall not triumph in my woes! I'll hide me In desert haunts and die!—or rouse my soul To actions worthy of Capana's son! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Deep Caverns that lose themselves in the Distance. Pedrarias, Gusman, and Spaniards. PEDRARIAS. Gusman, it was a dreadful night! Methinks The heavens smile not on our enterprise. Has Perez seen my son? GUSMAN. He has, my lord. Long practised, in their secret haunts, to hunt The natives, he, with matchless skill, has traced The winding way the fugitives pursued. These caves conceal his trusty band. PEDRARIAS. 'Tis well. Our veteran troops where posted? GUSMAN. In the rear, A few hours march, my lord. Refresh'd by rest, Elate with hope, and burning with impatience, They wait their conquering chief to lead them on. PEDRARIAS. Perez, thou said'st e'en now, had seen my son. Summon him, Gusman; I will question him. [Exit Gusman. Thanks that thou yet art safe, my son! What pangs Have I endured, since from a father's presence In wrath I banished thee! Re-enter Gusman with Perez. Good Perez, welcome. Thy skill and diligence have well deserved. How follow'd'st thou Alphonso and the slave? PEREZ. My lord, I traced their steps by many signs: Here, twisted boughs had form'd a hasty bower— There, lay remains of fruits; beside the rill, The shells of cocoa nuts had served as goblets. PEDRARIAS. And didst thou see Alphonso? PEREZ. Yes, my lord: But two nights since, Zamori and your son, Beneath a plantain so profoundly slept, That by the moonlight I could dwell a space Distinctly on each feature. PEDRARIAS (aside). Two nights since! How many chances may two nights involve, And two long days that have gone by since then! PEREZ. E'en now, my lord, I saw Zamori. PEDRARIAS (eagerly). How? PEREZ. Beneath dry leaves, within a thicket laid: I scarcely breathed. PEDRARIAS. And by his side Alphonso? PEREZ. Zamori was alone. With alter'd carriage, He raged—he beat his breast—and, desperate, On the cold earth he flung himself. PEDRARIAS. Spoke he? PEREZ. Some words he mutter'd, and methought the tones Were those of deadly anger—menaces, As though of vengeance. PEDRARIAS. Tones of anger!—menaces! (Aside) Gods! can the slave I deign'd to favour?—Yes, A Spaniard, and Pedrarias' son, might well Become the object of Zamori's vengeance! Retire, good Perez. Gusman, I will follow: In th' inner cave we will concert our measures. [Exeunt Gusman and Perez. Ungrateful, wayward boy! Thou little know'st How still the father hangs about this heart! I would not lose thee, no—for all the wealth Of either world! But wherefore take th' alarm? The slave's hand raised against the conqueror's son! He durst not—no—the thought is idle—vain. Besides, Alphonso had his sword!—No more— These fears might better suit a trembling mother, Than one, who, heaven commission'd, seeks new worlds, Sets on their shores his foot, and stamps them his! [He follows Gusman and Perez into the further caverns. ACT IV. SCENE I. The first Mountain Scenery. Alphonso, Amazilia. ALPHONSO. Forget me, hate me, lovely Amazilia; And let me fly, and yield me to despair. [Going. AMAZILIA. Whither?—Whither? ALPHONSO. Where I may never more Behold thy fatal charms! AMAZILIA (with desperation). Nay, if thou dost, I will not live!—No, by yon Heaven, I will not! An Indian knows a thousand ways to death, No death so frightful as were life without thee. ALPHONSO (after gazing on her earnestly). I dare not trust my eyes—thy every look Exerts a several destructive power! AMAZILIA. Kill me, if I am in my nature hurtful! Kill me! but fly me not—Yet wherefore hurtful? My heart goes forth to every thing that lives With kindliest will. I would not crush the reptile E'en though it stung me. Am I then more cruel Than venom'd reptiles? for they spare their kind, But I, thou say'st, injure whom most I love. ALPHONSO. Nay, nay; it is involuntary wrong!— Alas for poor Houaco! slavery, tortures, Were powerless to dash his bosom's firmness. Thy scorn alone could break that noble spirit. AMAZILIA. I do not scorn Houaco. Must I wed One whom I cannot love—as now I feel This heart can love? (With enthusiasm). Oh yes! it would revere Its object, as above the human race; And, hanging on his words, his looks, would catch A new soul, and new hopes, and glorious thoughts! ALPHONSO (aside). Oh gratitude! Oh friendship! bar each sense! AMAZILIA. Alas! and can I honour thus Houaco? Returning from the battle, if he bear An hundred scalps of those his hatchet slew; If on his steps, when crown'd with victory, His fellow creatures manacled attend, To bleed before the altars of our gods; Say, shall these eyes, by thee unseal'd to truth, Behold with sympathy that husband's triumph? If thou would'st doom me to a fate like this, Oh! why dispel the darkness of my soul, And break upon me, as Heaven's glorious beam Darts through the mountain chasm, by lightnings rent, Awaking life and joy, where since creation Darkness, and silence, and inaction dwelt? ALPHONSO. Dear, lost enthusiast!—Curse! Oh, curse the hour I led thy glowing fancy— AMAZILIA. Hold! for mercy! Curse not the gleam of bliss this heart has caught, To sweeten the long life of misery To which thou doom'st it now! (With sudden earnestness). But whence the law?— Haply of some more cruel God than ours Thou hast not told of yet;—for not of nature The law that bids thee give me to Houaco. ALPHONSO. Friendship, and gratitude— AMAZILIA. Hast thou no friendship? Hast thou no gratitude for Amazilia? Must all—all be Capana's and his son's? Thou said'st I saved thy life—have they done more? And do they love thee, honour thee as much? ALPHONSO (after a conflict). Believe me, Amazilia, this poor life Has worth but as thy gift! and for thy sake To lay it down were joy! but thus to live! Oh no! thy sweetness cannot—must not guess The torturing force stern honesty exerts To rule this breast; for might I loose the curb Of headlong passion, at full bliss to aim, What were it, think'st thou, but to see thee ever, To claim thy tenderness, to call thee mine! AMAZILIA. Thine—thine I am! the fates have will'd it so! 'Tis nature's strong decree! 'tis Heaven's! 'tis virtue's! ALPHONSO. Hold! Hold!—Does virtue bid us seek delight Reckless of all beside? I to Houaco Have sworn a brother's faith—to him thy father Gave thee!—He lives! and I, with holy love, Must honour thee as my Houaco's wife! [A pause of consternation. Shall we, who boast of Christian virtues, own A thought, a wish, so selfish, and so base, As our own bliss by his destruction purchased? Nay, is there bliss for them who know remorse? And what remorse were ours! AMAZILIA. No more, Alphonso! Thy awful words confound th' astonish'd sense, Yet woo my trembling soul to higher thoughts Than e'en—the heaven I dream'd—to live for thee! Say—were I—by such self-devotion, stamp'd A being worthy of thy fellowship? Of thy regard? to thee a kindred spirit? ALPHONSO. Thy matchless virtue were as far above My humbler aim, as are thy matchless charms Above the sum of loveliness dispensed To all thy sex beside; and I should live (If live—I—must) to honour—to adore! AMAZILIA. Firm as thyself in virtue's path, Alphonso, Thou shalt admire, and wonder at thy victim. See, at thy feet I welcome wretchedness! [With profound resignation. I am Houaco's wife! ALPHONSO (aside). (Oh! dreadful sounds! 'Tis agony I feel that should be joy!) I thank thee, Amazilia; yes, I thank thee, With fervor, as when pleading for my life Thy angel tongue preserved me!— (Turning from her). Spare me now! Let me not look on thee!—I pray thee go. Thy Laila waits thee, and thy happy lord Claims thee—his own!—(Stern honour, holy friendship, Blot out the madd'ning thoughts that rise!) (As she approaches meekly). Oh! leave me! I do beseech thee, leave!—in pity leave me! [Amazilia goes submissively and dejectedly. Accept the sacrifice, my benefactor! I, who might fold her to my burning bosom, Yet, for her thousand, thousand glowing charms, Embrace despair! [Throws himself on the bank, then starting up with horror. It is my father's curse, Wretch that I am, pursues me to the end! Shun me, Houaco! Shun me, Amazilia! I bear destruction wheresoe'er I go! With deadly influence, as the baleful mildew, O'er the young harvest of your loves I pass'd, That but for me (the winter fled) had been Fair ripening now beneath a smiling sky. [He sinks on the bank in despair. SCENE II. A different and wilder Part of the Mountains. HOUACO alone. Ye angry Gods, by my forefathers worshipp'd, How terrible ye crowd upon my soul! What spoke your thunders, rolling o'er my head, Through the black vault of night? Your fiery bolt Flashing on the lithe rattlesnake that lay Coil'd at my feet?—They spoke thy will, Illapa, Demanding thus thy victim at my hands, And imaging, in the insidious serpent, The Spaniard who has stung me to the soul. My father wrong'd thee, vengeful Deity! Of blood, thy due; and I, more guilty still, Won by Alphonso's blandishments, forgot The hate, the deep unconquerable hate, I vow'd to fell Pedrarias' race—Nay, more, Gave him the friendship of an honest heart, And lent my easy ear to his smooth words, While joy and hope won softly on my soul: Joy—the attendant of the thoughtless child, And hope—that waits on fools! [Thelasco and a troop of Indians are seen approaching among the rocks. THELASCO. All powerful Heaven! Or does a wreathing vapour mock my sight, Or art thou from the land of spirits come To warn us of impending ill?—Oh stay! Whate'er thou be, thou seem'st Capana's son, And thus my heart acknowledges the semblance. [Bowing down before him. HOUACO (starting from his reverie). Friend of my youth! my father's friend! Thelasco! [Embraces him. How fares it with the good Cacique, Capana? THELASCO. He lives! and in his son restored, is happy. Come, let me lead thee to him. HOUACO. Stay, Thelasco! Oh stay! I am not yet prepared; thou see'st How the firm temper of my soul is shaken! Think not the ills our cruel foes inflicted E'er moved me thus!—'Tis here, Thelasco, here [Beating his breast. It rankles e'en to madness.—Yesterday— Oh! yesterday!— THELASCO. Forget the pass'd day's ill: Think of to-day! th' auspicious day that brings thee, After two years of sorrow for thy loss, To share our happiness, thy father's gift! HOUACO (not attending to him). Virtues fantastical!—By Christians dream'd! Ye are vain names! flowers that wreathe the dagger They plunge into our breasts! (To Thelasco, eagerly and wildly). Valour in war, And fortitude that tortures cannot shake— Say—are not these the virtues of the Indian? Revenge, if wrong'd, his duty and his solace? Is it not so, Thelasco? THELASCO (astonished). Surely, so! But wherefore hang dark thoughts upon thy mind When all is joy? Each social bliss awaits thee; A people's welcome—friendship—love! HOUACO (with a bitter laugh). Ha! ha! [Then falling into his former melancholy. I have no friend, Thelasco!—Idle love Is for the fortunate! THELASCO. As thou shalt be! HOUACO (not attending to him). Had I nor eyes, nor ears? Where were my senses? Did he not falter? did he not turn pale, Oft as I named the maid? And when I told How to my arms, when yet a sportive child, Her dying father gave her, he exclaim'd, “Oh! tie indissoluble! sacred!” clasping His trembling hands; then, starting, blush'd, and smiled; And on the sudden all was calm, serene, As smooth hypocrisy's own brow!—Fool! fool! [Striking his forehead, and relapsing into his thoughtful posture. THELASCO (alarmed, to the Indians). My friends, the heavy ills our chief has known Prey on his wounded spirit: wild disorder Oft waits on thought intense in noble minds. Bear the glad tidings that Houaco lives To all around. Summon our people straight In joyous bands, with festive song and dance, To welcome home Capana's warlike son. (To Houaco). [The Indians go. In yon deep-bosom'd glen, 'mong beetling rocks, Dwell the surviving few of the young band That follow'd thee in thy first days to battle. There, sorrowing for thy loss, in gloomy caves They hang their idle hatchets, till they hear Thy voice, Houaco! thy awakening voice! Rousing them from their sad inglorious ease, To lead them forth. HOUACO. Ha! there again thou strikest! My youthful band of friends!—Oh, hide me from them! They still are free, and on their native mountains Share with the savage of the wilds his prey; They ne'er felt chains!—Oh, no! The lasco, no! 'Tis not the slave must lead the freeman forth! Troops of Indians advance from among the rocks, with festive garlands, &amp;c. CHORUS OF NATIVES. Is the patriot chief restored? He whom India's sons deplored, He who sank on slaughter's field, Where new forms of death appal; He who bade us bleed and fall, Nobly fall—but never yield! CHOSEN BAND OF WARRIORS. A people's vow Has won our leader from the tomb! His sadden'd brow, Hung with dark affliction's gloom, Shall smile again beneath the victor's meed, And hail! with transport hail! his injured country freed! CHORUS OF NATIVES. Bearing on with hope elate, From his beaming eye flash'd fate! He th' avenger's work began, The spell of panic terror burst; And his daring hatchet first Proved the invader was but man! BAND OF WARRIORS. To yield the breath, And give to dust the mangled frame, This is not death! It is the warrior's birth to fame! On! to the field of glory lead again, And drive the invader back,—back to the guilty main! [The Indians crowd around Houaco with wonder, joy, and affection. LASCALA. Noble Houaco! thy return brings joy, Brings hope, brings life, to every Indian warrior! Bliss to our great Cacique! But I—I, too, Had sons I loved! to war with the invader They follow'd thee. Trembling I ask their fate. HOUACO. Lascala, the brave youth who bore thy name, Beneath his hatchet saw a Spaniard fall, Ere to the land of spirits he was welcomed By his forefathers. LASCALA. Oh! had I died so! [He is lost in grief, while and old woman comes forward. WOMAN. And at thy feet I ask my Zama's fate: Zama, from whose strong arm the arrow sped Unerring in the chase. HOUACO. Nor err'd in war. But the forged thunders of th' invading foe More fatal sped, alas! WOMAN. Ah me, my boy! And shall he never more, at evening's close, Bear homeward from the mountain's side the prey To cheer our cabin hearth? And shall Nayati, His faithful wife Nayati, never more— HOUACO. Ha! faithful, say'st thou? Was Nayati faithful? She shall be honour'd above all her sex! Let her be crown'd—be led in triumph hither! I thought there was no faith in womankind; There is, it seems—there is—but not for me— Houaco only is to no one dear. THELASCO (aside). How strange his words! LASCALA (with trembling anxiety). But say my Azlan lives; One lives, at least, to close his father's eyes. HOUACO. He lives— LASCALA. He lives? and follows not thy steps? HOUACO (with bitterness). He lives; and shares the fate—the bitter fate— Of great Capana's son. [He bares his wrist, and shows it to Lascala LASCALA. These marks, Houaco, What may they mean? HOUACO (with the utmost bitterness). Chain'd!—manacled!—a slave! Capana's son has lived! LASCALA. Say'st thou “has lived?” And has th' invader bound e'en mighty Death To do his will? Can Death no longer free The man who will not live? HOUACO. To die, old man, Were easy, as 't were sweet. The very weeds Our careless footsteps bruise, with juices teem Will loose from life. 'T were but to have refused A little maize, and I had slept the sleep Th' invader could not break: but sweet revenge Had then been lost! Who would not live, Lascala, And shake off death, e'en though within his grasp, Nay, snatch at life with strong convulsive fondness, Whose country's wrongs, whose private injuries, For vengeance call? LASCALA. There spoke Capana's son. Yes, we will follow thee where vengeance leads, And free my Azlan. HOUACO. Stay, Lascala—stay! Vengeance is slow. I, to Capana, must Unfold the deep and secret means, nor strike Till sure the blow. Thy Azlan's self would bleed Were this hand rash. (To Thelasco). Valiant Thelasco, Lend me that weapon in thy girdle fix'd. [Thelasco hesitates. Yes, Amazilia had been faithful too, But for the potent spells these treach'rous men Have foully wrested from mysterious nature. Give me that weapon, and await me here; Anon I will return with new life fraught, And freer thoughts. I cannot yield my soul, E'en to my country's claims, my father's love, Till I have satisfied a private duty Of strong imperious urgency. The weapon! Give it, Thelasco, to my eager grasp. THELASCO. Take it, and may'st thou plunge it to the hilt Where I would see it buried! [Houaco rushes out with the dagger—Thelasco watches him. With eagle speed, By godlike vengeance wing'd, see how he darts From cliff to cliff. We at a distance, friends, Will follow on his steps, to grace his deeds, Or, if aught ill befall, to give him aid. [Exeunt, with music, as they entered. SCENE III. Alphonso lying on the bank where he had thrown himself in despair—Laila behind him scattering weeds around his head, unobserved by him. He sinks to sleep, and she comes gently forward. LAILA. At length a dull, and drowsy torpor steals O'er his torn bosom: such the lulling virtue Of this pale weed, whose chilly blossom shrinks From the fierce glare of day, expanding wide To the moist moon, that nightly brims its cup With vapours dank, of power to lock each sense, And lap the limbs in motionless repose.— Soft—soft!—methought he moved. [She scatters more weeds. Deep sleep be on thee! Thou creature of another world, beyond The vast, and terrible ocean!—Thou, so noble! And yet, so fatal!—Slumbers deep be on thee! While I (so prosper Heaven my true affection!) Seek the deluded, desperate Amazilia, Win back her faith to him, her destined husband, And to our peaceful valley lure her steps. [Exit. Enter Houaco, not seeing Alphonso. HOUACO. Yes, yes,—I will avenge my country's wrongs! Appease the Gods of India! claim my wife! And, more than all, pierce fell Pedrarias' breast! Wring from him, pang by pang, and groan by groan, Th' atonement of each several broken heart, That drags out life upon this ruin'd land! The thought awakes a dark, and sullen joy, Worthy of him who was Capana's son— Blasted by slavery, and to glory lost. [Turning to go, sees Alphonso. Thanks, ye immortal powers! who thus present The sacrifice to th' injured Godhead due! [He contemplates him. How still his slumbers! And can treachery sleep? How calm and open is his brow! Has guile So fair a habitation? It has—it has— And shall not lurk beneath a form so gracious, To lure th' unwary to destruction. Thus— [Going to strike. Why shakes my coward hand? It is a deed Of highest virtue!—pleasing to our Gods!— I will not shrink— [Advancing resolutely, and removing the garment from Alphonso's breast, starts back. The pledge of amity My father gave him, shields the very spot Where I would strike! [Returning with assumed resolution. I must remove it.—No— I dare not!—no— [Trembles, and drops the dagger. Capana guards thy life! ALPHONSO (starting up). Is it a joyous vision? or, indeed, Do I again behold my lost Houaco? HOUACO. Alphonso, thou behold'st thy murderer! But that this hand has fail'd.—That sacred pledge Stood between thee and death! ALPHONSO (affectionately). Thou rav'st, Houaco. Come to my bosom!—Art thou not my friend? HOUACO. Stand off, false Spaniard!—Bind these limbs with chains! Give to the rack (if thou would'st live secure) Th' assassin of the tyrant's guiltier son! But I will brave thy rage, and scorn thee still! ALPHONSO (seeing the dagger on the ground). Too true;—this fatal weapon proves thy words. This have I not deserved of thee, Houaco! And thou shalt feel it, if thou hast a heart! Did I not swear to thee a brother's love? [Extending his arms affectionately towards him. The brother's part is ever to forgive. Oh then forget with me that thou hast wrong'd me. [Taking his hand. HOUACO (confounded, turning away). What powerful magic in his words o'ercomes me? Can he, unmoved, thus grasp his murderer's hand, Nor aught of anger, aught of fear betray? What hinders that I seize again yon weapon, And plunge it in his bold, unguarded bosom? What hinders?—but that it were easier far To bury it, and my confusion—here! [Striking his breast. ALPHONSO. Combat no longer with thy better feelings! Let thy heart speak, and, ere I clear myself, 'Twill bid thee rest thy head upon this bosom! [Houaco, overcome, throws himself on Alphonso's bosom. I am content.—Thy honour trusts in mine! Be cheer'd;—brush off that tear, and meet with smiles Thy Amazilia.—Her unalter'd faith Shall prove my truth.—Houaco, I can suffer, E'en as thyself, unmoved! HOUACO. Canst thou, Alphonso, Canst thou forgive the headlong rage that arm'd This hand against thy life? ALPHONSO. 'Tis not remember'd. Blot from thy mind alike—But see—she comes— Be blest in her thou lov'st—'tis all I ask. Let me conceal this weapon from her eyes. [Conceals the dagger in his bosom. Now all is well.—Resume thy tranquil mind. Enter Amazilia in great agitation, breaking from Laila. AMAZILIA. Refuse me not to speak one last farewell!— Houaco here!—in friendly conference! Then am I lost indeed!—Their bond of union Too well, too well I know—my wretchedness!— Instruct me, Laila, to pronounce my doom! And oh! Alphonso's God! support my courage! [She advances with great effort, and throws herself at Houaco's feet. Low at thy feet, behold thy wife, Houaco! Thou, pardon the involuntary error Of one, restored to duty—and to thee! HOUACO (raising her, and pressing her to his bosom). Oh! spare me, Amazilia! lest my brain Support not all the joy that breaks upon me! (To Alphonso). Thou, before whom I bend with soul subdued, Disdain not the full triumph of thy goodness. The virtues I have prized are savage Nature's— Thine are from Heaven! ALPHONSO. Oh! no more—no more— 'Tis time that good Capana share our joy. Thelasco and Indians approach in joyous procession. they stop suddenly with astonishment and terror on seeing Alphonso. Thelasco fixes his eyes on him with a menacing expression. The Indians seize their bows, and wait the signal to shoot. HOUACO (placing himself between Alphonso and the Indians.) My friends! my countryment! replace your arrows. This is the godlike youth Capana spared! The Indian's friend!—Behold my father's pledge! [Pointing to the pledge. They drop their bows, and replace their arrows. To him I owe my liberty!—to him— That I again thus clasp, my bosom's treasure! (To Thelasco). I was deceived, Thelasco,—thou shalt learn How much I, to the generous Spaniard, owe! THELASCO (aside, after an expression of cold assent). What magic drugs, what herbs of potent juice Yield the strong spells that guard this wily Spaniard? At his approach the God of Vengeance flies! Th' uplifted weapon slackens in the grasp, And every heart, with strange unwonted softness, Gives its full confidence! HOUACO. Lead on, my friends. Within your deep retreat a little space We will repose:—this tender frame, o'ertoil'd, Requires short respite.—Amazilia, say, Shall it be so? AMAZILIA. Thy will, henceforth, is mine. [Houaco, Thelasco, and Indians, move off in triumph, among the rocks at the back of the stage, Amazilia looking mournfully at Alphonso as Houaco leads her away. Alphonso lingers behind, in great agitation. ALPHONSO. Repose!—delay!—And must I, drop by drop, Dwell on the deadly draught myself prepared? Oh, that Time wore the driving Tempest's wing, Whose headlong sweep might leave no pause for thought, Till to Capana I restore his son, And in his happiness find peace—or die! [Exit, following. The Scene closes on them. ACT V. SCENE I. Scene among the Rocks, with a distant View of the Valley. Alphonso and Houaco. ALPHONSO. Yes, all is well. Now seek we Amazilia, Where late we left her with the mountain band? HOUACO. No, she is more secure in that retreat With those who followed on my youthful steps. The mountain lama could not footing hold On yon steep crags: the spoiler cannot find The well conceal'd and only access thither. My treasure's safe. We are not yet assured Whence was the clamour, as of hostile tongues, That broke, by fits, the stillness of the night. ALPHONSO. We have discovered nought that may confirm Thy fears, Houaco. Trust me, all is well. The sounds thou heard'st were, sure, imprison'd winds: They, in deep caverns pent, will chafe in tone, That, by each rock repeated, much resemble The brawling of rude tongues. Away with doubt! And from this cliff, as from the eagle's nest, Behold the wished for valley spread below. Within an hour thou wilt embrace thy father.— Give all thy soul to gladness! HOUACO. Oh! Alphonso, In this long-saddened heart joy cannot harbour But as the flash that o'er the stormy sky Darts amid rolling thunders, and again 'Tis darkness all! Alas! with sad forebodings Shuddering, I seek the vale. [He looks anxiously about. Distant cries are heard. And hark! Those sounds Are not the busy stir of peaceful life: No—nor the voice of gratulation. Hah! The din of war rings thus upon the ear, Or shouts of fierce pursuit. ALPHONSO. Forbid it, heaven! And yet thy terror has infected me. (Listening) Now all is still again. It were impossible! Thou know'st the dreadful thought—I dare not speak it. But say—oh say—it is impossible! HOUACO. And hark, again! Heard'st thou that hideous yell? It grows upon the ear. It must be so! ALPHONSO. If it be so, I by thy side will fall, And dearly sell each drop of my heart's blood For India's injured sons. No—save his father's,— No Spaniard's breast is sacred to Alphonso. [Drawing his sword. HOUACO. Yes, that same dagger shall redeem its guilt. Oh, give it me, and thou shalt see how strong Against an iron host, a single arm, Nerved as Houaco's, by a cause so dear— My father! and my people! and my wife! Give—give the dagger! ALPHONSO. Take it; but first swear Thou wilt not aim it at Pedrarias' breast. HOUACO. Nay, take it back again, if such the terms. ALPHONSO (baring his breast). Then once more point it here! I will remove Capana's cherished pledge, and give it way! Or plunge it here, or say my father's sacred. HOUACO. And wherefore, think'st thou, I have suffer'd life? For two long years have dragged th' invader's chains? Born to command, protect, and lead a people, Have bowed this body to the servile oar? Wherefore did I reject thy fellowship, Till driven from his presence, cursed by him, My heart forgot thou wert Pedrarias' son? Wherefore all this?—but that I hoped to quaff The cup of sweet revenge! E'en now 'tis mine, The luscious draught! and shall my lips refuse it? ALPHONSO. [Nearer cries are heard. The foe is on us! I will trust in friendship! Take thou the dagger to defend thy father: This sword must guard the author of my days E'en against thee! for not to parricide, Although to treason doom'd by holiest ties, Each crimson drop that swells within these veins Must flow for good Capana and his people! Indians pass across the stage pursued by Spaniards Alphonso and Houaco rush upon the Spaniards, and presently drive them back. The Indians gather round Alphonso and Houaco, full of joy and wonder. ALPHONSO. Yes, Indians, yes—ye see Capana's son! Restored by Heaven to save you from your foe! Behold in me the Spaniard your cacique Released from death! both to your service vowed: By nature he!—and I by gratitude! On! follow us to liberty and vengeance! But mark me, friends; dismiss the well-aim'd shaft, Then instant turn, nor grapple with th' invader. Keep still aloof—surround him—harass him; Be swift—be indefatigable.—On!— [Exeunt with expressions of ardour and joy. SCENE II. The Valley, with the Altar, Throne, &amp;c. Pedrarias and Spaniards pursued by Houaco, and Indians. Pedrarias recognises Houaco, and turns. PEDRARIAS. Is it the slave Zamori's daring hand Against Pedrarias raised? Stand! Indian, stand! [They for a moment contemplate each other. This blade shall give thee back thy forfeit life, So thou declare where thou hast left Alphonso! HOUACO. Tyrant, come on! nor parley with thy foe! See, in Zamori, great Capana's son! The chains that have disgraced these free-born limbs, My father's wrongs, my country's desolation, Render this little weapon swift, and sure, And terrible as the avenger's thunder! Thousands of slaughter'd Indians hovering breathe Their spirits in my soul, and guide my hand! [They close and struggle. Houaco disarms Pedrarias, and drops the dagger in the conflict; casts Pedrarias on the ground, and setting his foot on his breast, points his own sword at it. Lie there, thou fell destroyer of my people! Where are thy conquests now? thy power, thy greatness? I met thee man to man, and there thou liest! Beneath my foot I might crush out thy spirit, And rid my groaning country of its tyrant! One motion of this hand and thou art nothing— A name!—a sound!—to future ages hateful, E'en of its terrors stript! But to Alphonso! The son thy rage has cursed—I give thy life! [He rushes out with Pedrarias's sword, leaving his dagger on the ground. PEDRARIAS. Am I a Spaniard?—he a savage Indian? Oh for swift lightnings, earthquakes, hurricanes, To raze this new found world from out existence, And thus from record blot the conqueror's shame! Thousands on thousands withering curses blast thee, Insolent slave! Curst be this arm! and curst My dotard weakness! for not Pedrarias—no— The father 'twas, whose edgeless sword dropt, palsied By the base slave's evasion, when I asked Of my lost son. But hold! Alphonso lives! Let me but find him, from the Indians tear him, Then ruin—slaughter—utter devastation Rage on, and feed insatiable revenge! But who are these? shall they behold me thus? Ha! the slave's dagger!—it may do me service. [Takes up the dagger, and conceals it in his breast. Enter Gusman and Spaniards with Capana and Indians captives. GUSMAN. My lord, behold the proud cacique, Capana! Thus victory is ours, although Alphonso, (Whom, were he not thy son, I might term traitor), Has raised his sword against his countrymen, Mowing them down with wild resistless rage, To rescue from our hands this savage chief. PEDRARIAS (with great anxiety). And did my people turn their arms against him? Who followed him?—Where is he?—say, how was it? GUSMAN. The frantic natives thronging on his steps, With hurtling arrows darken all the air, That even our veterans, appalled, shrink back, Or fall, ere they have marked the coming death! In firm array, if we advance, behold, As formless spirits of the night, they vanish! And on the right, or left, or in the rear, Gathering again, they deal their dole of death, And quick disperse as soon. Doubtful, astonished, Where'er thy son appeared our soldiers fled! Nor had I held my prisoner from the rescue, But that I pointed at his breast my sword! PEDRARIAS. Haste, Gusman, haste! Command that they respect The viceroy's son, nor harm him, on their lives! But, if it may be done, secure Alphonso, And bring him to my presence strongly guarded. [Exit Gusman. (To Capana). And do I then behold the proud cacique, Whose vain resistance has destroyed his people? CAPANA. Thou see'st a chief who for his people lived: A man who fought for native liberty. PEDRARIAS (with the utmost bitterness). Thou hoary savage! skilled in hellish arts! Thou who hast wrought upon a noble Spaniard To mock at filial piety, and fall From due allegiance to his sovereign lord! CAPANA. Tyrant, I gave thy son his forfeit life, Because I pitied thee!—and for this weakness Our Gods have justly now deserted me. But answer thou.—Was it thy treacherous son Who led thee hither? For the damned act But ill accords with these his deeds in arms. Say, must my latest breath, or curse, or bless him? PEDRARIAS. How may it aught import Pedrarias' son, The idle words a dying savage breathes? CAPANA. If right I judge, the youth whose life I spared, Capana's dying curse may much import him. PEDRARIAS. Nay, curse him not, old man! Thou hast no cause— He bears a curse this heart would fain recall. CAPANA. Ha! is it so? Then will Capana bless him! PEDRARIAS. Dost thou insult a conqueror, whose nod May doom thee to such tortures as appal Humanity? CAPANA. No tortures can appal Capana's spirit! In this time-worn frame Kind Nature has, with gentle hand, unravelled Her own work, till there is little left for thee To mar with violence. Few strokes are needed To level with the dust the leafless trunk; While the majestic palm, in youth's full honours, Wearies the woodman. Alphonso rushes wildly in, followed by Houaco, and throws himself at Capana's feet. ALPHONSO. Oh my benefactor! Thus let me expiate, at thy feet, my folly! That I am guiltless, thy Houaco knows. [Presenting Houaco to him, who throws himself into his father's arms, and they remain engrossed with each other. PEDRARIAS. Confusion! Is it at Capana's feet Pedrarias' son should kneel, when in the presence Of an offended father? Turn, rash boy! “A father's anger may not last for ever,” If meek remorse, and duteous thoughts, succeed Thy fatal dereliction! ALPHONSO. Duteous thoughts This breast has ever own'd! Remorse, my father, Alphonso knows not! He has not betray'd His noble benefactor, and his friend; But, ruin'd with them, will partake their doom. PEDRARIAS. The flames are kindling will reduce thy friends To idle air, and dust that I may trample. ALPHONSO (to Capana). Disdain not thou my fellowship in death, My more than father! [Embracing his knees. PEDRADIAS (aside). Oh! impotence of rage! CAPANA (making a group with Alphonso, and Houaco). Unhappy tyrant! object of my scorn! I mock the power thou boastest o'er my life! For what import a few convulsive throbs, That set at large a spirit fraught with joy, With love, with triumph, thou canst never know! See, I embrace my noble, long-lost son,— Nay, more—the captive youth my heart adopted, With filial tenderness, would die with me; While thou, who doom'st me to devouring flames, Enviest thy victim!—I could pity thee, But that to pity thee offends our Gods. [Embracing them both. My children dear alike! PEDRARIAS (frantic with rage). Has hell worse pains? By him adopted—to his bosom prest— A savage, by the right of war my slave!— I cannot wait the slow consuming flame, My sword— [Grasping the empty scabbard. HOUACO (haughtily). Thy sword no longer, but thy conqueror's! Has wash'd away its guilt in Spanish blood. PEDRARIAS. Zamori too?—Worse hell! [Recollecting the dagger in his bosom. Hah! thoughtless slave, Thyself didst furnish to my rage the serpent Shall sting thee home!—Die, hoary villain,—die! [Rushes to stab Capana, when Alphonso interposes his breast, receives the stroke, and falls on his father's neck. ALPHONSO (after a pause). My father! Oh my father,—yes, I thank thee. This stroke is merciful,—is kind.—It gives The only good that now thy son could know— To die for him, my benefactor!—Oh! If ever I was dear to thee, my father, Let not thy son lay down his life in vain. This blood, that flows thus freely—gladly flows— At the strong call of gratitude—is thine! See—on thy breast it falls!—Oh! let it not There stagnate!—rather swell, as kindly dews, The latent germ of mercy! PEDRARIAS. My Alphonso! Curse on my frantic rage!—It cannot be The blow was mortal? (With tenderness). Look up, and smile, my son! [Watches Alphonso with trembling anxiety and hope. CAPANA. Noble, but rash and ill-advised Alphonso! Why didst thou snatch me from the death I courted? I should have fallen in all my full-blown joys; Now, if I live, it is to sorrow. [Hiding his face, overcome. PEDRARIAS (with a forced smile and faltering voice. Nay, Thou would'st but terrify thy wretched father, Who in all nature loves but thee alone. Thou know'st it, and would'st work upon my fondness. But live, my boy! and it shall be henceforth E'en as thou wilt.—Yes, I will heap each blessing On these, thy friends. [Alphonso makes an effort to express his joy, and falls back into his father's arms. PEDRARIAS (with extreme terror). He bleeds apace!—Help! help! ALPHONSO. Oh!—no—I feel I cannot live, my father! 'Twas Heaven unnerved, erewhile, thy arm, and now Directed with unerring might the stroke— Heaven's pity spares me—without her to live!— Heaven's justice guides thy hand—to execute The curse—thy lips—but bless me now, my father! Oh! bless thy dying child! PEDRARIAS. Distraction! Horror! Wretched old man! Despair is mine, and madness! (To Houaco). In pity, slave, take thou this hated life. ALPHONSO. Be calm, my father, nor thus doubly point The sting of death!—Oh say,—my friends are free! PEDRARIAS. They, and their people shall be free and happy. I swear it by the trembling hope I feel Thy parting soul forgives thy murderer. ALPHONSO. Now on thy dear, and honour'd breast, I sink— In sleep as calm as weighs down infant lids. [Looking affectionately at his father. 'Tis sweet to rest upon a parent's bosom! [Reaching his hand to Houaco. Give me thy hand, Houaco! Amazilia— Will grieve for me.—Oh soothe her sorrow gently!— I thought thee dead, when first I saw the maid. HOUACO. And loved her, and did yield her to thy friend! And must I lose thee? Oh, thou gracious pattern Of virtues thou hast taught me first to know! [A moment of speechless grief, when Amazilia breaks her way through the attendants, who try to stop her. AMAZILIA. Nay!—Give me way! Not thousand, thousand weapons, All pointed at this breast, could stay my steps! [Stands gazing at the group, transfixed with horror. Then in the wildest manner. Ha! What have I to do—if it be so? PEDRARIAS. Away with her!—Her sacrilegious cries Disturb the awful horrors of despair Within a father's and a murderer's breast! HOUACO (going to her from ALPHONSO). My Amazilia! thus high Heaven reclaims Its own! and as a god, henceforth Alphonso Will watch o'er those he loved, and guide them still. AMAZILIA. Away!—I know thee not—nor heed thy words! See there—see there!—His spirit takes its flight! I must away! ALPHONSO. My Amazilia!—Oh!— [Dies. AMAZILIA. He calls on me!—He bids me follow—See! With lifeless hand he beckons me away! I come! I come! [Seizes the dagger which lay on the ground, and stabs herself. HOUACO. Oh, stay thy frantic hand! AMAZILIA (supported by HOUACO). Alphonso! Oh, one moment hovering stay! Thou didst refuse my fellowship on earth, But wilt thou now reject the attendant spirit, That through immeasurable space, with thee, Would soar to worlds—of Love—and Liberty? [Breaks from Houaco, and throws herself on Alphonso's body. PEDRARIAS. Have ye not hatchets? arrows dipp'd in poison? Ye injured natives! though to vengeance vow'd, One—one devote to pity!— AMAZILIA (raising herself from the body, and looking wildly around her). Who are these? Oh! help,—and loose the bonds that bind me down To earth!—How heavily—Oh! how heavily They weigh upon my bosom!—I would spurn The abject soil, and spring into the skies! But—Oh! I sink—I sink—Wilt thou not stay? Where art thou now? [Struggling violently. Oh where? I see thee not! [She stares wildly on Pedrarias. It is thy murderer!—It is thy father!— His eyes glare on me!—Save me from him—Oh! [Gives a shriek, and dies. The curtain drops. [A section of translations has been omitted here.] END OF VOL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II “Per desio di Lode Non canto io, no; ben per chi m'ama e m'ode.” Vittoria Colonna. This tragedy was first printed in 1815, as it had then been prepared for the stage. I now restore the original catastrophe, and some other parts which had been cut out. I have also compressed many passages, and hope to have succeeded in rendering the piece more deserving of the protection it received from individuals, when rejected by the public. As I retain the title of tragedy, I, for the same(I think obvious) reasons, retain the name of “Ina,” although I am aware it was once borne by a good old king, of whom we know little else. The sound appears to me feminine, and I have a fanciful preference for it, as bearing some affinity with Inez de Castro, whose melancholy story suggested the fable of my play. PROLOGUE, BY THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM LAMB. The tragic Muse, in this our later age, Has seldom shed her influence on the stage. With jealous eye, with cold disdainful mien She turns away, and seems to claim the scene For those, to whom her loftiest lays belong— The mighty masters of her earlier song. For her high thoughts, for her impassion'd strain, For her proud crown, so often sought in vain, To-night you hear a timid votress dare Address an humble, yet ambitious prayer. Say, should her powers beneath her task decline, And sink, unequal to the great design, Yet can you from her aim your praise withhold; Bold is that aim, but noble as 'tis bold. As erst in Athens, mighty mother state Of all that's lovely, as of all that's great, The gifted bards, whose grave and simple song Held high dominion o'er the list'ning throng, Drew from their country's first heroic day The wondrous subjects of their moral lay: So, in that time, when nations, driv'n to roam, Had sought in this fair Isle another home, And barbarous chiefs, where each had led his band, Now sway'd divided empires in the land; In that rude time, which gathering ages veil, We fix the scene of our fictitious tale; Which seeks by natural passions to impart A human interest to the human heart; A tale of secret love in generous youth, Uncompromising honour, dauntless truth; Faith, which sore-tried nor change nor doubt can know, And public danger mix'd with private woe.— For, e'en amidst those dark and murderous times, Religion's errors and ambition's crimes, Athwart the gloom of that tempestuous day The native spirit shot a splendid ray; The spirit of the land—whose course appears Mark'd by its glory down the path of years, Unalter'd still through every varying state, The lapse of ages and the turns of fate— And late, when o'er us gleam'd the troubled air, With signs of woe and portents of despair, The soul of Britain, tranquil and the same, Shone forth to all mankind a guiding flame: And if those times of toil must come once more, If blasts again must rise, and thunders roar— The beacon, brighter 'midst the gathering night, Lifts high to heav'n its unextinguish'd light, And, from the sacred Isles commanding steep Streams life and safety o'er the labouring deep! INA. A TRAGEDY. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Cenulph, king of Wessex. Egbert, his son. Alwyn, Egbert's friend. Oswald, Mordred, and other lords. Baldred, a crafty monk of the royal blood. Osric, captain of the guard. Edelfleda, princess of Mercia, betrothed to Egbert. Ina, secretly married to Egbert. Bertha, an old lady, confidant to Edelfleda. Elenor, and other ladies, attendants on Edelfleda. Alice, attendant on Ina. Blanch, attendant on Ina. Messengers, Soldiers, Peasants, &amp;c. SCENE, the kingdom of Wessex. ACT I. SCENE I. Edelfleda's Antichamber. Bertha, Elenor, &amp;c. BERTHA (entering from the inner apartment). The princess will not yet come forth. She thus Will oft retire from gaiety and splendor To sit and muse. ELENOR. She is much changed of late. There was a time when she was always pleased. She chid me yesterday, I know not wherefore. The broider'd robe, I wrought with so much care, She cast aside, and said it suited not Her homely features. BERTHA. Homely features, said she? The beauteous princess Edelfleda! ELENOR. Yes. She is but changed in mind, although she blame Her outward form: she is no longer gentle. Dost thou remember something of this humour, When the orphan Lady Ina's charms erewhile Arrested every eye and every heart Of the gay court? BERTHA. Fie on thee, Elenor; Thou would'st not tax thy mistress with base envy? ELENOR (archly). Not so—but when the Lady Ina was forbid The royal presence, our fair Edelfleda Shone forth more radiant; as the glorious sun Himself is wont, when the o'ershadowing cloud Is wafted by the angry winds away. BERTHA. The king of Mercia's daughter, so adorn'd With every gift of royal excellence, Were rather deem'd the sun that shed a radiance O'er the slight vapour sporting in his beams. ELENOR. Nay, you are angry now; but 'tis well known How much Prince Egbert loved the Lady Ina. BERTHA. Silence, imprudent girl! At such an hour, When for the royal nuptials we prepare, If she should hear thee speak the hated name— ELENOR. I will be silent. But even thou hast own'd The princess loved not her—I may not name. Enter Edelfleda (they appear embarrassed). EDELFLEDA. Why start thus, Elenor, and blush to see me? Wherefore dost thou look strange upon me, Bertha? It seems my presence is to neither grateful. Accurst the day I came to Wessex' court! E'en my own women, Bertha, even thou Wilt soon forsake me. BERTHA. How have I deserved This keen reproach? EDELFLEDA. Go, leave us, Elenor! [Exit Elenor. Forgive my wayward temper, dearest Bertha; And may'st thou never know the pang that forced The peevish word which seem'd to chide thy love. BERTHA. Alas! my princess, double is the wrong To own a pang, nor share it with thy Bertha. EDELFLEDA (embarrassed). What have I said? Oh! there are pangs that shun All fellowship. Grief utters its complaint, And finds a sweetness in its gushing tears; But this!— BERTHA. Remorse alone speaks thus. EDELFLEDA. Remorse Were his, more justly, who inflicts the ill. Wrongs undeserved, and borne in silence, wake No conscious blush. The weak complaint alone (By pride disown'd) might crimson o'er my cheek. BERTHA. If breathed to me? To me, whose raptured ear Drank the first half-form'd accents of thy tongue. EDELFLEDA. This hated court is Edelfleda's prison, Not the gay scene of her famed beauty's triumph. But Mercia's king, the valiant Ethelbald, Will free his daughter, and avenge her wrongs! Restore her to her country—to her honours— To all restore her, save to happiness! Neglected! scorn'd! BERTHA. By whom neglected, scorn'd? EDELFLEDA (embarrassed). The king!—his nobles! BERTHA. The king loves—honours thee; Already, princess, holds thee as his daughter, Whom a few days will make Prince Egbert's wife. EDELFLEDA. Prince Egbert's wife! Oh! never, never, Bertha. Why hast thou touch'd that string? BERTHA. I thought no ill. Came you not to this court betroth'd to him? And gaily came, a joyful, willing bride. Is not Prince Egbert knighthood's fairest flower? EDELFLEDA. Too sure, I came; gay, thoughtless, young, and free; And, oh! too surely he is all thou say'st: Nay, far beyond thy fancy's reach endow'd! BERTHA. Thy speech is still at variance with itself. EDELFLEDA. 'Tis but the picture of the strife within. BERTHA. My child! these dreadful words of mystery Fill all my soul with terror. I adjure thee, By my long services, my faithful duty, Speak thy full heart. EDELFLEDA (after a conflict). He loves me not, good Bertha. Spare, spare a princess' pride, and guess the rest. BERTHA. Heaven shield thee! would'st thou say he loves another? Nay, think it not: she has been long removed. EDELFLEDA. I named her not. Ha! then thou know'st it, Bertha! Or hadst not glanced at her. Thou know'st it; speak, Oh! tell me all; it is too late to hide it. BERTHA. Indeed I nothing know—believe me, nothing: The idle rumours of an idle court— Should they arrest our thoughts? EDELFLEDA. What idle rumours? And am I then the jest o' the idle court? Do they point at me as I pass, and say 'Tis she! 'tis the neglected Edelfleda! BERTHA. Be calm, my princess; see the holy Baldred: You did yourself request his presence. Enter Baldred. EDELFLEDA (resuming a dignified manner). Father, You are welcome. I would claim a service; For sudden purposing to leave a court Where I have long resided, while the duty A daughter owes a father— BALDRED. Can it be That Edelfleda leaves the court of Wessex, When all the palace, all the city, hail With gratulation her approaching nuptials? EDELFLEDA (haughtily). Softly, good Baldred. Learn that Mercia's princess Is not so lightly won, nor gives her hand As to the careless boor the village maid, Willing ere woo'd, or rudely woo'd at best. BALDRED (sarcastically). Ill would the faltering phrase, the humble sigh, Become the lip accustom'd to command! Would'st thou Prince Egbert, he so graced by fortune, Should bear himself as common lovers use? EDELFLEDA. I heed not how the prince may bear himself. Go, Baldred; plead his cause in other ears, Where it may more import. What may concern My honour, is my sole, my proper care. I claim no service of your courtesy, Save to make known, e'en now, to royal Cenulph, My purpose to return to Mercia's court. [Exeunt Edelfleda and Bertha. BALDRED (alone). And is it so? And will she sacrifice To pride, her passion for detested Egbert? This may work mischief to the man I hate. All kindly feelings from my breast I banish'd, When, in disgust and bitterness of soul, O'er my deep festering wounds I flung this garb. It was for Egbert fortune slighted me! Ere he had grasp'd a sword, I led the battle! When lo! he comes a meteor in men's eyes— Draws in his glittering train my soldiers' hearts— I woo'd fair Ina, and was paid with scorn: While Egbert—curses on him! fired alike— Though now to hate be turn'd the love I bore her, My bosom holds remembrance of the offence. Enter an Attendant. ATTENDANT. The king demands your presence, holy father, On matters of high import. BALDRED. I attend. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Cenulph and Lords. CENULPH. The times indeed do wear a fearful aspect. You, noble Oswald, Mordred, Alwyn, Orgar, Have shared my counsels with the holy Baldred; We have most sure advices from our outposts That Ethelbald has arm'd, but yet declares not His hostile purpose; still in martial shows Breathing his powers: as 'twere the boar enchaf'd, That whets his hideous tusks, and wounds the soil, Rooting up herb and flower. OSWALD. My gracious liege, And can you doubt the purpose of proud Mercia? Have not of late more frequent messengers Sped with unwonted diligence 'twixt him And his fair daughter? nay, who has not mark'd The princess' alter'd mien—the quick succession Of fierce conflicting passions on her brow? The day is not yet fix'd that gives her hand To Cenulph's royal heir. The people murmur, That thus the pledge of peace with Ethelbald Should still on vain pretences be deferr'd. CENULPH. Oswald, thou pointest to my sorrow's source. My friends, ye know Prince Egbert's ardent temper, In childhood haply foster'd by indulgence. ALWYN. We do, my liege; but his impatient spirit Is coupled with such warm, heart-winning frankness, Such all-embracing kindness, it but seems The larger bounty of more lib'ral nature. MORDRED. A father or a friend may see it thus, But it is dangerous.—To this we owe, (This spirit so impatient of control,) That we are threaten'd by dread Ethelbald. CENULPH. We sheathed the sword, my friends, and Edelfleda Came to our court—the pledge of mutual love Betwixt two nations harass'd by long war. Betroth'd to Egbert, all a mother's care, From my good Editha, the princess shared. The general sorrow, while my poor queen languish'd, And her lamented death, forbade the nuptials. Meantime—(Ah! woe to me that e'er I foster'd That serpent in my easy bosom) Ina, The orphan daughter of brave Sigiswold— OSWALD. My liege, removed you not the lovely mischief? Forbidding her the court and festive pageants? CENULPH. I did; and thought to quench love's idle flame, By sending Egbert to command the force Raised to repel the inroads on our borders. Whether it be, that all on martial deeds His soul intent, he spurn inglorious ease, Or that his fancy still on Ina dwell, The court he shuns, and its gay soft delights; And late, when at the tournament, proclaim'd In honour of the beauteous Edelfleda, He bore the prize from all the knights of name, Neglectful of the princess,—at her feet He placed nor sword nor trophy,—but abrupt Broke from the lists, unmindful and discourteous. MORDRED. Justly the haughty princess is offended. Enter Baldred. BALDRED. My Liege, I come from Edelfleda's presence, A messenger unwilling—to declare Her sudden purpose, ere the nuptial rites Have seal'd the bond of union 'twixt the states, To seek her father's court. OSWALD. My sovereign Lord! The public weal at stake— MORDRED. Prevent her purpose— Delay not, sire, to solemnize the nuptials. CENULPH. But she must first be soothed.— OSWALD. The prince alone Can bend her proud neck to the gentle yoke She would be woo'd to wear.— CENULPH. Retire, my friends,— Alwyn, find thou my son. Thou know'st his haunts. Command him to my presence in my closet. I must be firm—my crown, my honour, all Must be secured this day by his obedience. I have too long been passive.—Mark me, Alwyn, For thou dost hold, I know, the master key That locks his inmost counsel; nay, with voice Of soft persuasion, while thou seem'st to yield, Dost bend his lofty spirit to thy reason: See that he come disposed to do my pleasure. It is the King who will confer with him. Tell him he has too long abused the father. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Ina's Bower. Egbert and Ina. EGBERT. Oh, yes! I was indeed to blame, my love. Too much I yielded to the timid counsel Of cautious Alwyn. INA. Thou wast not to blame. Thy mother's fondness, and her sov'reign sway O'er thy kind father's heart;—her care for me, The orphan daughter of her earliest friend— EGBERT. And thy brave father, too, whose loyal breast Received the dagger aim'd at Cenulph's life— INA. And at his feet expired! EGBERT. Oh! these were hopes And claims, that sanction'd well the confidence With which I snatch'd thee to my beating bosom, Call'd thee my wife! my dear, my honour'd wife! And swore that thou should'st be ere long acknowledg'd By Cenulph, his throne's heiress, and his daughter. INA. Thou could'st not then foresee that cruel death Would rob us of the queen, and our best hopes. EGBERT. But that I did respect my father's sorrow, I then had at his feet confess'd my fault— Ha! said I fault to love such excellence? INA (starting). Methought I heard approaching steps; each sound Appals me, since I live a sad recluse, With thoughts—tho' not of guilt—that shun the light. EGBERT. This is my worst reproach!—That virtue's self Should be by me condemn'd to own the fears Which only guilt should know. Enter Alwyn. INA. It is kind Alwyn: Welcome, my friend. Oh! soothe his troubled mind, That dwells with too much pain on our lost hopes. ALWYN. Alas! I am the bearer of worse pain. Ye have heard that Ethelbald has taken arms— The offended princess past all hope estranged.— The king, awaken'd by th' indignant lords, And by the people's murmurs, which have reach'd At length his careless ear, in angry mood, Has sent me to command you to his presence, To press,—I fear—with Edelfleda— EGBERT. Peace! 'Twere sacrilege to utter such a thought As now hangs on thy lip.— INA. My much-lov'd lord! Oh! hear good Alwyn: hear him patiently.— Too long we fondly from our thoughts have driven The frightful future in our present bliss. EGBERT. And would'st thou I should hear him bid me wed With Edelfleda?—Cast thee from me?—thee! By every holy tie my wedded wife! ALWYN. But by the laws, alas! and king, not sanction'd! EGBERT. Can human laws o'ermaster the divine? Tear from a mother's breast her infant joy, And bid a father's heart not own his child? Can a king's breath annul the thing that is? INA. Be calm, my Egbert! oh! it is not thus By eager words of fruitless controversy We can avert the ill, or find the means To reconcile our duty and our love. I will retire, and leave thee with our friend: Yes, my loved lord! true friendship has more skill To work our good than our self-blinded judgment. It knows not passion—for it takes the soul Out of the earthy mould where passion lurks, To watch,—a guardian spirit,—o'er the weal Of its true object: as the sun it shines For others' good!—still giving, without thought Of like return! so high! so pure! so bounteous! Oh! I do think kind angels lend to friendship Some touch of their divinity, to raise Th' aspiring thought to heavenly harmony! [Exit. EGBERT (gazing after her). She is herself that heaven of harmony! Oh! Alwyn! blest in Ina's love, thy friend Is lost to life's low cares. ALWYN. Too true, my prince; In voluntary blindness thou hast pass'd Thy thoughtless days of visionary bliss; But I must rudely rouse thee from thy trance, And bid thee look, with eye firm fix'd, e'en now On all the fearful truth. EGBERT. Speak on.—I am calm. ALWYN. The king expects thee. He will press thy marriage With Edelfleda. EGBERT. Alwyn, were I not To Ina bound by ties so dear, so sacred— Oh! no—I could not think of Edelfleda But as a sister. Once to Mercia's court I went a stripling, ere the feud arose That sever'd us, and plunged the states in war. In th' op'ning splendour of her awful beauty I honoured her with boyish reverence. ALWYN. And woo'd the Mercian princess—yes, you woo'd her: Whisper'd gay flatteries in her willing ear At banquets, tournaments, and courtly revels. EGBERT. Well, grant I did so—'twas a stripling's homage At beauty's shrine: she was of riper years. ALWYN. Two summers more had but matured her charms, And not impair'd. You woo'd her, in good sooth. EGBERT. Nay, why insist? I had not then seen Ina. Who shall resist his fate? ALWYN. Resist his will, More aptly had express'd your thought. EGBERT. My friend, Thou wert not wont thus keenly to retort. ALWYN. Nor would I now, were not the ruin imminent, And no redress save one. I crave your patience: You have abused the princess, much abused. EGBERT. How shall I soothe her but at honour's price? How speak, and not redouble my offence, Disclosing all the truth? ALWYN. Thou'rt new to love, If thou know'st not how lightly we believe What we too fondly wish! The heart forlorn Will snatch e'en from a word, a look, a nothing, A fearful hope of sweet returning kindness. Avert her anger, you avert the sword Upheaved by Ethelbald t' avenge his daughter. EGBERT. But said'st thou not, the king would urge the nuptials? ALWYN. Uncertain of thy love, the haughty princess Will spurn the hand but offer'd as the pledge Of union 'twixt the states. EGBERT. Oh! let me rather Shun the wrong'd princess' presence, or declare My wedded faith: I know not to dissemble. ALWYN. Yes; shut your eyes, and let the ruin come! Nay, nay, my prince, hear me! The veteran bands, Not yet dismiss'd by peace to their far homes, On the fresh news that Ethelbald has arm'd, Demand thee as their leader. I but ask, That thou dissemble till the trumpet summon To arms the late disbanded men of Wessex. EGBERT. And wherefore, friend? ALWYN. The chief who sways as thou His soldier's hearts, may, with best vantage, treat With angry Mercia, or repel his rage; Best may avert, or over-awe the vengeance At Ina aim'd. 'Tis for thy wife, thyself, I plead, no less than for the state; and ask But that thou play awhile the cautious part. Be rul'd by me—conceal thy marriage still A little space. EGBERT. I will: and bend my spirit To cold occasion. Yes, for Ina's love I will defile that singleness she prized. Alwyn, I had mark'd the crooked ways of courts, And in the arrogant dreams of boyhood, shaped To myself a course of future glory So proudly honest! but I find that he Who would hold on the broad and open way, Not once may swerve aside, howe'er allured. ALWYN. Your father waits—Come on, my friend. EGBERT. I come. [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. Cenulph, Oswald, &amp;c. CENULPH. And has a king no friend? Would no one tell What, it seems, all or knew or did suspect? And have his secret visits been so frequent To this abandon'd woman? Artful fiend! Well might she meekly thus retire content, And shun the public gaze, as I commanded; When, at her feet, all languishing with love, Lay Cenulph's son, the heir of Wessex' throne! Ye all have been in league—are traitors all! OSWALD. My liege, you wrong our faith. It is but now I learn what I have given to your ear. CENULPH. By night, say'st thou, he from the camp would steal? OSWALD. Ev'n so, my liege. When, in the crimson west, Mantled in blushing clouds, the sun went down, Each order given, the prince would mount his steed; Swift as the winds, and as direct his course, He topp'd the mountain, skimm'd the valley, plunged Into the foaming river, stemm'd the current, And reach'd the bower where Ina waited him; Then, ere the grey light streak'd the eastern sky, With course as rapid, he regain'd the camp. CENULPH. Perdition seize the sorceress! That the child Of Sigiswold, my youth's first friend, in age My counsellor—who in th' extreme of peril Gave me his life.—Leave me. [Exit Oswald. The soldiers, too— Who hailed him first but as their good king's son— Sought but to trace in the young eagle's bearing Some semblance of the sire— Enter Alwyn. ALWYN. Prince Egbert waits. May I beseech your grace, assail the prince With gentle speech. Howe'er his spirit rage Beneath the iron curb of harsh control, His heart will answer every tender touch With readiest sympathy. CENULPH. He must, he shall, This very day, espouse fair Edelfleda. OSWALD. Nay, my good lord. She too must now be won To give her hand; but that would cost small pains To Egbert's self, might he be brought to wish it. 'Tis to this end I would that you urge home To his warm, generous nature, all the ruin, Dishonour to your crown—the thousand mischiefs That hang on his refusal, till his heart Embrace our cause, forgetful of its own. CENULPH. I hear his steps—away! I will suppress My anger, Oswald, and will touch each string That readiest vibrates in the generous breast. Attend the princess hither. She requests A private audience. [Exit Oswald. In Cambria's fastnesses The Druid seers, with hymns and sounding strings, To such religious frenzy work the soul, That mothers dash, before their gods, exulting, Their sucklings to fierce flames. Hang on my lips The golden phrase of patriots! so to grace The cause of public virtue, that my son, Alike exulting, from his breast may dash This worthless woman's love! Enter Egbert. Egbert, draw near: Sit thou beside me. I am old, and worn By a long reign of war—of cruel bloodshed, It was not mine t' avert. The throne I fill Will soon be thine, and I would know from thee Thy thoughts of the high office. EGBERT. Oh! my father! As yet unknowing but of martial rule, To rouse, direct, or quell the soldier's rage— Of thee I hope to learn each exercise Of peaceful government. CENULPH. And dost thou think To learn of me to hold the throne of Wessex, But as a larger means to do thy pleasure? To hold the people but as flocks, nor care How many swell th' account of them that bleed, If but thy giddy passions be indulged? EGBERT. How should I learn of thee these tyrant maxims; Thou, who hast ever sought thy people's good? CENULPH. If such has been the measure of my sway, How much must wiser Egbert scorn his father! Egbert, who rather would unbar the gates, And hail, with impious welcome, the invader, Than aught control his idlest appetite. EGBERT. No, my loved father; I would give my life To save thy simplest peasantry from ill. Oh! let me prove it in the field of glory, And pour forth all my blood! CENULPH. Go to, rash boy; 'Tis not thy blood thy country asks of thee: 'Tis not thy blood can make thy father happy: No, if thou hadst but entertain'd such thoughts As suit thy royal birth, thou hadst, ere this, Assured our people's welfare and thine own. Now, 'tis too late; the sword is drawn that dooms Thousands to pay the forfeit of thy fault, While thou wilt, thoughtless, revel in light joys I blush to think upon! EGBERT (much affected.). My guilty soul! Each word a deadly weapon! Oh! my father! CENULPH. A princess mock'd by nuptials vainly promised! My name, my crown, branded with foul dishonour! I shall not long survive this sum of ill; Thus parricide will heap the monstrous measure Of thy licentious deeds!— EGBERT (terrified). Most horrible! Are there no means? Oh, point the way, my father, To thy unworthy son! Let me alone Meet the uplifted sword of Ethelbald, And free thy people from the threat'ning foe; Nor from a subject's veins one precious drop Distain the peaceful soil.— CENULPH. It is well said.— Insult a princess,—break her generous heart;- And murder then her father!— EGBERT (clasping his hands.). Wretch accursed! Am I so deep in guilt? CENULPH (taking his hand kindly). Not yet, my son; But such the course thou headlong dost pursue. EGBERT (eagerly). Not yet? and is there time? Oh, then thy son Will act a worthier part. CENULPH. Why, this is well.— I will ascribe to wild unbridled youth What late hath reach'd my ear. Not wanton smiles, Soft lisping lips, and braided locks, the toys One born to rule should sport with—save indeed, As he would, at the careless banquet, quaff The luscious mead, each graver care discharged. But see, my son, fair Edelfleda comes. Think of her wrongs: you woo'd her, won her love. She came a stranger to a foreign court, Abused by hollow promises, and hopes, That in high souls will sicken to despair Ere yet the lofty brow betray a pang. EGBERT. Much injured princess! Villain that I am! I know her generous nature: at her feet I will pour forth my soul—atone my fault— Oh yes—she will forgive—will pity— Enter Edelfleda and Bertha. EDELFLEDA (aside to BERTHA). Bertha, May I believe my senses? have I wrong'd him? CENULPH (to EDELFLEDA). Thou, unawares, hast heard my son declare What a rude soldier's plain unpractised tongue, Awed by thy charms, had ill express'd to thee. EDELFLEDA (watching EGBERT). Royal Cenulph! I but claimed your patience To ask such escort—as becomes—my state,— Unto my father's capital—in—Mercia: This was my errand—nor thought I to meet One—almost—grown a stranger—in this presence. CENULPH. Doubtless, fair princess, if it be thy wish Thy native court to visit, and thy father, When the new season smiles with happy omen, Thou shalt have royal escort, as befits us, And love shall guide thee, Hymen light thy way,— Meet convoy for the beauteous Edelfleda, And mine and Mercia's daughter! EDELFLEDA. Royal sir, As Mercia's daughter only must I go. Nor can as Mercia's daughter brook delay. I claim no other title. CENAPH. Thy father pleads in vain: speak thou, my son. Thou may'st prevail on filial love, perhaps, (Though much I honour this its pious wish), Awhile to yield its claim to claims more sweet, And yet more powerful. EGBERT (much embarrassed). Fair Edelfleda! Thou know'st our youth, contracted by our fathers; Ere yet our hearts had spoken, we were doom'd By Hymen's bonds to ratify the peace Betwixt two war-worn nations. EDELFLEDA. Oh! sad lot Of royal slaves, who thus are bought and sold! But no, Prince Egbert—no, not so, our fathers Barter'd with their children's hearts. Mutual The affection—mutual—once—the tie—and I Shall still esteem—thy virtues, Prince—shall still Bear with me the remembrance of thy worth,— Though far—far—distant. [She turns away to hide emotion. EGBERT. Say not so—Oh, hear me, Unworthy as I am: in pity hear me! It was not thus erewhile you turn'd away. Reverse this harsh decree, and from remorse, Or worse destruction, if worse be, save him Who once found favour in thy sight: nay, turn— Turn, gracious Edelfleda! EDELFLEDA. Might I think That from thy heart these words of gentler import— Might I believe—the slighted—Edelfleda— Indeed—were—I adjure thee, on thy soul, Trifle not, Egbert, trifle not!—be plain! EGBERT. Not though the axe were lifted o'er my head, Could I one moment longer, by feign'd words, Abuse thy generous temper. Hence, base art! Dissimulation, hence! Speak nature! truth! [Throwing himself at her feet. See, princess, at thy feet a wretched man, Bowed to the level of the peasant swain, Who trembles for the lowly roof that shelters His wife and little ones! CENULPH. What mean thy words? EGBERT (with dignity, rising). I am, like him, a husband and a father! [Edelfleda sinks into Bertha's arms. CENULPH. Darest thou avow it?—Ha! rash youth, beware! Thou art a subject still, nor could'st thou pledge Thy faith, unsanctioned by thy king! thy father! My royal word was given to Ethelbald. EGBERT. King! there are ties of nature stronger far Than even those convention has stampt sacred 'Twixt man and man, by social compact bound. The rudest savage, howling amid deserts, That tears his vanquish'd foe, devours his flesh, And quaffs his smoking blood, does yet defend His mate, the mother of his babes, with wild And desperate love; and meekest things that creep, Or wing the air, in nature's dearest cause Will brave destruction from the spoiler's rage. I am a husband, king! I am a father! CENULPH. Guards! secure the traitor. Enter Guards and Alwyn. ALWYN (aside). Who now will shield poor Ina? EGBERT. Her Egbert will! (To the guards.) Off, sirs! first take my life! [The guards fall back. ALWYN. Oh! yield, dear prince! Yield, if the life of Ina yet be precious! EGBERT. My Ina! for thy sake— [Gives his sword to the guards. Sirs! take my sword! And now my chains! [The guards approach fearfully and reluctantly to chain him. CENULPH. Why tremble ye? Obey! EDELFLEDA (recovering). Monarch! grown hoary in deceit and fraud! Leagued with thy worthless son to insult me thus! Ye shall for this feel Ethelbald's dread arm: Hurl'd from your throne, and prostrate at his feet, Shall sue in vain for mercy, while your cries, The cries of Ina—e'en her infant's cries— Shall fall as sweetest music on my ear. Ev'n now great Ethelbald is on your borders; 'T was I unsheath'd his sword! 'T is I who guide it! And none but I can turn its edge aside! [Exit with Bertha. CENULPH (to EGBERT). Thus, wretch accursed! is this devoted land, Her wounds scarce closed, and scarce renew'd her strength, By thee to war's fell demons given again; Nor though th' abandon'd, the perfidious Ina, Were doom'd to pay the forfeit of her crime, By deep disgrace, by death in lingering torments— EGBERT. Ha! torments? lingering torments, said'st thou, tyrant? But Heaven's own angels watch o'er innocence! Nor can there be conceal'd in human shape The fiend could touch her with a hand of harm! The most remorseless villain, bred to blood, Fierce creature of thy fiercer will, would shrink At sight of Ina, in the majesty Of virtue, beauty, youth, distress! CENULPH. Away! Guards! drag him hence. Ha! Osric in such haste! Enter Osric. OSRIC. My liege, with rapid march the King of Mercia Advances on thy frontier. Deadly his rage! His powers, the breathless messengers declare, Rush as a torrent with impetuous course On the devoted land. No order taken, Confusion and dark mutiny prevail Among our troops. The surly soldiers, murmuring, Demand Prince Egbert at their head. CENULPH. Prince Egbert? What? to a traitor shall I trust my cause? OSRIC. Such confidence in him each soldier feels, Such love, such loyalty: I know it well, They will fall off, or coldly meet the foe, If any other leader— CENULPH. Is it so? Then is it time I yield my forfeit sceptre, Lest he with impious hand should wrest it from me! [He throws down his sceptre, crown, or any emblem of royalty. Guards, free the man who henceforth is your king, And do with me as does the graceless churl, Who lays the axe, remorseless, to the oak, That stretch'd its sheltering arms o'er his forefathers, When wintry winds have stript its leafy pride. EGBERT (rushing to him with passionate tenderness). See me, my honour'd father, at thy feet! Oh speak not words that cut my heart asunder! Resume thy honours— [Giving him the sceptre. See thy humblest subject! Oh show some signs of pardon and of comfort, That I may say thy son—thy penitent son. Yes, trust thy cause to me—to thee I trust All that my sould holds dear—my wife! my child! [After a pause, taking his hand with great emotion. If I should fall, they will be dear to thee. CENULPH. Oh Egbert! Egbert! thou go'st near to break Thy father's heart. Thou wast a duteous son. Once more I trust thee, nor admit the thought Thou yet hast practised aught disloyal. Leave me. Alwyn, thy arm. [Egbert offers his assistance, and Cenulph puts him away. Nay, I would be alone. [Exit Cenulph with Alwyn. EGBERT (alone). 'Tis Alwyn's arm supports him—not his son's! Alas! this keen rebuke is just, my father: Yet dost thou trust me; and thy confidence, So precious, shall be justified by service Thou look'st not for at my unworthy hands. Re-enter Alwyn. ALWYN. My royal friend—I tremble but to think Of thy imprudence.—How avert the ills— EGBERT. Alwyn, no ill awaits the upright course! This dark concealment! 'twas the only stain My bosom knew.—Oh! could'st thou guess the load It has thrown off! how buoyant all is here! Avert what ill? for, grant I lose a crown, (An awful charge, not merely a gay circlet To grace the brow) integrity remains! Were I not happier? ay, and worthier too— A sturdy peasant, with undaunted front, Grappling with stern adversity, than wielding Sceptres by wrong obtained, or violence To inbred honesty:—my friend, I have led My countrymen to battle: each bosom owned As brave a heart, and in his country's cause As warm as mine—and haply each, like me, Had his heart's partner too at home, who trembled, And wept for him, as Ina for her Egbert. There is a brotherhood in tented fields, Where all with equal venture play for lives, That wakes a consciousness we are but men, And men alike, till worth has made distinction. [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. Edelfleda, Bertha. EDELFLEDA. Leave me, good Bertha; thy officious love But wearies me. BERTHA. Thy pardon, dearest mistress. EDELFLEDA. These cumbrous robes, these idle ornaments, Oppress my bosom. Thou hast deck'd me out As 'twere a victim for the sacrifice.— I am the victim! thou hast wisely done! BERTHA. The artful Baldred rules King Cenulph's mind; Nay, can compel, some say, the stubborn fates, By prayers, and penance, and mysterious rites. Through his means haply thou may'st triumph yet. EDELFLEDA. Yes! I will triumph yet—but if the means Recoiling fancy dare but faintly shadow, Oh Bertha! Bertha! dost thou think kind nature Form'd me for darkest deeds? Oh, no! her hand Temper'd my soul to gentleness and love, And stampt it with a royal loftiness; But it is given in possession now To such a friend!—so irresistible! [Hiding her face in Bertha's bosom. Thou'rt good and kind!—oh! throw me from thy heart! I never more shall there deserve a place. BERTHA. That heart is thine, my princess,—owns no bounds To its devotion! nay, take hope—take comfort— Th' astonish'd king was as thyself indignant. Thou saw'st the prince in chains! King Cenulph loves thee— He will annul the marriage. EDELFLEDA. How annul it? Not if she live! he cannot sunder hearts. No, if she live—it is impossible. I would have fled ere the ungentle wish That she were not— BERTHA. Then think of her as dead! Thy wish might stamp her doom. EDELFLEDA (with horror). What, murder her! BERTHA. Not that.—Stern policy has instruments Secret and sure. Thou know'st the envious abbot Beneath that saintly garb wraps deadly hate. EDELFLEDA. Let me not hear—nor guess what thou would'st say. It will be mine to soothe him when 'tis done! I must not bear the horrid consciousness About my heart;—for I will win his love By virtue then, by tenderness, and patience! Then did I say? as, then! what thought was that My guilty soul admitted? oh! is virtue So convenient? will she? can she dwell again In the polluted bosom she forsook? Or if she could—remorse must usher her! Unutterable woe!—oh, save me!—save me! [After a pause. One only means is left may yet preserve These hands from stain of blood. Some pitying angel Whispers the thought.—Come, Bertha! let us haste. [Exeunt. SCENE II. BALDRED (alone.). Too long, methinks, the king confers with Egbert. He leads the army!—I would have it so.— The time has been men fell in fight.—Death ruled Unquestion'd there.—Yet now, methinks, for him All weapons lose their edge!—But has this head Forgot the means t' effect this bosom's purpose? I hate her now—yet envy him his joys. Yes, but for him I had won her—but for him In love's full confidence had met those eyes, Had clasp'd that hand in love. Enter Egbert. EGBERT. What! murmur'st thou of confidence and joy? Of eyes that meet, and hands that clasp in love! BALDRED. That sinful in their sweetness are these things, And as rank weeds that wear a gaudy blossom, Should be uprooted from the wholesome soil; While, as the liberal herbage spreading wide, Or sacred grain, friendly to general life, The public weal alone should be our care. EGBERT. These maxims, holy kinsman, are severe For one erewhile a gay, a gallant soldier. What! for the public weal would'st thou uproot That which does make the public weal our care? Why fill the eyes with tears? Why leaps the heart? “Our country” but the theme of our discourse? We love the land where first the light of heaven Broke on our eyes!—dear by all childhood's joys! Her soil enfolds our fathers' honour'd bones! Our friends and kinsmen reap her golden harvests! But there are ties! which thou hast thrown from thee, That more than these endear our country's name! That brace the thrilling nerves, and swell the bosom— Doubling the powers and energies of man! BALDRED. Ha! did I throw from me those ties? (howe'er My heaven-ward thoughts despise them now!) thou treach'rous, Thou gay insinuating flatterer!—thou, Who stealing on the promise of my bliss— EGBERT. 'Tis false, proud priest! Her love was mine, ere thou Hadst with loathed passion gazed on Ina's charms. She ever hated thee!— BALDRED. Thou say'st so, boaster! Haply my soldiers' hearts alike were thine, Ere I had led them forth.—I! who so long Fenced with this arm thy father's tottering throne Against dread Ethelbald.— EGBERT. Hold, Baldred, hold! I grant my father's throne was sore beset When mighty Ethelbald came thundering on. But force me not to say who fenced his throne. BALDRED. Nay, doubly treacherous was thy part! thou cam'st Prank'd in gay youth, and glittering novelty— With idle promises, alluring wiles— And won the dastard knaves, who had forsook me, To turn again with swift recoiling force On the triumphant foe; thus foully wresting The dear-earn'd meed of longer services. EGBERT. Vain reasoner! true; the flying bands I rallied By promises, not idle, if fulfill'd! Nor robb'd thee of the meed of victory,— For on thy brow I would have placed her wreath. BALDRED. 'Twas all hypocrisy!—'twas insult all! Thou still hast wrong'd me,—but I scorn thee still. Fortune's sleek minion! Flattery's demi-god! Awhile thou yet may'st flutter in their sunshine, A gay-wing'd insect, till the northern blast From short existence sweep thee, while the eagle Towers in her native skies! EGBERT. Peace! coward priest! Who thus secure, beneath that saintly garb, Dost blacken worth, and rail at envied greatness. BALDRED. Thy worth I own not, nor thy fleeting greatness. Power is true greatness! Go, guide thou the sword Thousands of sinews wield! but I can slack Those sinews that they loose their hold. Thus wrapt, I sway by holy awe the souls of men, And am superior in superior power! EGBERT. I mock thy blustering impotence and pride, But I respect the garb thou dost abuse, And, therefore, priest, I unchastised will leave thee, While yet my better thoughts restrain my arm. [Exit. BALDRED. Thinks he to awe me by his lofty carriage? And shall my spirit stand rebuked by his? Shall I, in blood his equal,—hang the head? Wondering, confess his rare endowments? Hail him With idiot incense as the vulgar use? There are tame spirits who recline content Beneath the greatness that o'ershadows them. The timid herds, denied by nature fangs To wage offensive war, will throng together— Obscure equality! The lion stalks This was first printed in 1815. Alone!—unrivall'd he!—the lonely tiger Leaps single on his prey!—these brook no equal; Nor will I, crouching, a superior own! [Exit. SCENE III. Ina's Bower. Ina, watching over her sleeping child; Alice, Blanch, &amp;c. INA. Sing me, dear maids, the lullaby I love; 'T will soothe my infant's slumbers, and may speed The lagging wing of time till Egbert come. SONG BY ALICE AND BLANCH. ALICE. Lull my babe in rosy slumbers, Whisper sounds that die away, Utter none but drowsy numbers, Luring dewy sleep to stay. BOTH. Lullaby, lullaby, Hush my babe with lullaby. BLANCH. But if on a brighter morrow Ope his eyelids laughing gay, Careless notes of light joy borrow, Lest his mother's tears betray He wakens to a world of sorrow. BOTH. Merrily, merrily, Maidens, then, sing merrily. INA. Thanks, my good girls:—yet, Alice, Egbert comes not. It seems an age that I have fix'd my eyes On that sweet sleeping innocence, thus hoping To lose the consciousness of each sad moment That slowly drags its length till he return. ALICE. The noble Alwyn went with him, dear mistress; Thou know'st his prudence well. INA. Still Egbert comes not. ALICE (after looking at the child). His sleeping features wear a joyous smile, And see, he stretches forth his little hands! Regard it as a happy omen, madam. INA. Kind Alice, thanks. Would my sad heart could do so! Poor helpless slumberer! oh! had I been born A village maid! a cottager, my Egbert! The war of elements the only danger That threaten'd our low roof—thy innocent smile Had waken'd but a mother's honest joy, Nor chill'd my heart, as now, with nameless fears. ALICE. Alas! the sadden'd fancy gives its colour To all it rests upon, and often paints In objects of delight some idle terror. INA. Hark! Alice, hark! feel how my poor heart beats! Some dreadful ill hangs o'er us! It must come, The hour of vengeance.—Royalty insulted! A father's love deceived!—Alice! how guilty Do I appear to my affrighted conscience Whene'er my Egbert tarries long away; But when he comes,—and when I hear his voice And meet his eye,—and feel how I am loved— And with what full devotion I am his, It seems not only happiness, but virtue, Glory, and honour!—all, are mine—and lift My proud heart— ALICE. Now I hear a busy stir! Sure 'tis the prince! INA (hastening to meet him). My lord, my life, my husband! [Meets Edelfleda, who enters with Bertha. Edelfleda measures her with her eyes as she totters back to Alice. EDELFLEDA. Why do you tremble, madam, and turn pale? I own that this intrusion can be warranted By none but its true motive. INA. Motive! princess? What motive prompts the gentle mind to seek The unhappy,—but some courteous, kindly impulse? And your eyes speak not such. Some dire mischance Perhaps—oh! tell me—tell me all—and with one blow— Alice—support me— [Sinks into Alice's arms. EDELFLEDA (aside to BERTHA). Is she so beautiful As to my tortured soul my eyes present her? BERTHA. 'Tis but the beauty of the menial train. The royal air is wanting. EDELFLEDA. Say'st thou so? Ah, no! that timid softness wins its way More surely to the heart.—I, too, were gentle, If I, like her, were blest. BERTHA. Perversely thus Ingenious jealousy will rack itself To deck its object. EDELFLEDA. Jealousy no longer, But hate, contempt, and vengeance— (To Ina, who recovers). I am sorry That you anticipate what I would say. If thus thou swoon while yet in ignorance, How wilt thou tear with self-destructive passion Those tresses in their dark luxuriance bound With skilful negligence around thy brow! Deface that matchless beauty with thy hands, Play o'er each practised act of desperation! When thou art told,—the prince thou hast enthrall'd, In a vile dungeon, bound with traitor's chains, Awaits the doom of his disloyalty. INA. Have mercy! heavenly powers! imprison'd! chain'd! But no—it cannot be—thou com'st to prove me. Thou too hast loved him, lady, and thou could'st not, Oh no, thou could'st not thus unmoved declare, That he whom thou hast loved—impossible! Thy voice had falter'd, and thy tears had flow'd! Yes, thou hadst pitied me, and kindred sorrow Had one short moment link'd our adverse souls.EDELFLEDA. Who tells thee, insolent! I love the prince? Or ever loved the base degenerate Egbert? 'Tis true that policy had doom'd our hands To a forced union once—and therefore was he Sacred to such as thou!—treason the thought In any subject's breast to match with him. INA. If it be treason, I alone am guilty. Treason regards but the aspiring subject; Nor can the same be charged on yielding greatness. Then plead for me in this, howe'er thou hate me. Plead for me, royal Edelfleda! Claim For me the chains he wears (if it be so That he indeed does wear them); set him free: [Kneeling. I, I alone have sinn'd against the laws! The king, and him, and thee! EDELFLEDA. All! all! thou fiend! And think'st thou it can aught atone my wrongs, Though low I see thee, grov'ling at my feet? Off, shameless woman! Shameless Egbert's choice! INA (rising, and with dignity). The woman honour'd by Prince Egbert's choice, Founds on that choice her claim to more respect. As Egbert's wife, I must withdraw from one Unmindful what to Egbert's wife is due. [Turning to Alice. Raise gently, Alice, my sweet infant boy, Lest he affrighted wake; then follow me. EDELFLEDA (stopping ALICE, and gazing passionately on the child). Oh Heaven! Is this his child? INA. Madam, it is. You startle him. I pray you speak more softly. Ungentle tones ne'er wounded yet his ear. EDELFLEDA. Nay, take it hence. I know not why I look'd on't. [Ina, &amp;c. going. I had forgot the purpose of my visit; Will you not stay and hear it? [Ina returns. Edelfleda softens her tone. Ina, say— Would'st thou Prince Egbert, whom thou call'st thy husband, Were freed from prison, and from shameful death? I come to tell thee how to compass this. INA. Oh! pardon, gracious princess! that my ignorance Misjudged your generous purpose. Yet goodness, sure, Ne'er wore before such haughty looks and tones As you ev'n now did lend her. Name the means! Weak as I am, my courage will not shrink In such a cause, from any fearful task. EDELFLEDA. There needs to save him, but that thou forego The idle title thou erewhile didst boast; For, as thou know'st, it is of youth's gay coinage; Unsanction'd thus—an empty appellation— Offensive as 'tis empty. Claim it not. INA. Princess! I understand you. I am ready, By death, to cancel my pure marriage vow, That he may live, but by no other means; Nor is it fit I longer parley hold With one who counsels thus Prince Egbert's wife. [Exit. EDELFLEDA (after watching her in a tumult of passion). Thus scornful to withdraw!— (Striking her bosom). Hell! hell is here! (Turning eagerly to Bertha). Didst mark the infant? Had it not his brow? Methought I could have snatch'd it to my bosom With transport such as mothers scarce have felt, And instant came a horror—such a horror! That I had dash'd the tender form to atoms, Had I but held it in my shuddering grasp! BERTHA. Oh! let us quickly leave this fatal scene! Too much it racks thy bosom. EDELFLEDA. How I hate her! I envy her her very dangers, Bertha. She claim his chains! 't were mine the right to share them. Or rather I had brought all Mercia's power T'avenge his wrongs! Nor had I proved my love By tears and prayers, low grov'ling on the earth, But by such gifts as kingdoms! sceptres! thrones! Adoring nations kneeling at his feet! BERTHA. It yet will be so. This presumptuous woman Will meet the death she merits, and her image, Her worthless image, fade from the remembrance Of him who should be yours! EDELFLEDA. Yes, mine by right! By solemn compact mine! Attested mine By witness nations! And thinks she I will yield him? But, ah! he loves me not! What were his hand, His cold reluctant hand, without his heart?— Shall I not find some solace in revenge?— Yet will that sweeten life like what ev'n now These eyes have seen? Enter Egbert. EGBERT. Oh, Heaven! whom find I here? EDELFLEDA. I came to see this miracle of beauty, She for whose fatal charms two realms must lie In ruin, and for whom Prince Egbert Remorseless dooms his people to the sword; And I have seen her. [Going, he stops her. EGBERT. Hast thou seen my wife? Ha! Edelfleda!—How didst thou address her? EDELFLEDA (contemptuously). As is her due. EGBERT. Then as Heaven's fairest work! As Virtue's brightest gem! as Nature's pride, Didst thou address her!—and—as Wessex' princess! EDELFLEDA. Say, rather, as a subject too aspiring, Presumptuous, and vain; who gave her ear To idle flatteries from royal lips, And swerved from honour's path. I would have saved her, But she scorn'd my counsel. EGBERT (eagerly). Save her from what?— Say, princess! is aught practised against Ina? EDELFLEDA (going). Nay, it imports not me.—I would depart. EGBERT (stopping her). Oh, Edelfleda! I have held thee noble, Have ever honour'd thee. EDELFLEDA. Ye powers supreme! Oh hear his words! mark his unblushing brow! Thou! thou hast honour'd me?—hast held me noble? And didst thou honour me in Cenulph's presence, When late—oh! grant me patience, Heaven! an hour, A little hour has scarce elapsed,—since mock'd, Insulted—scorn'd. EGBERT. This keen reproach were due Had I thy royal nobleness mistrusted; 'Twas from thy generous nature that I hoped For help and stay in this my utmost need. Canst thou forget when in our earliest youth, Ere yet the fatal torch of discord blazed, Severing our houses,—of thy mother 'reft, Mine proved our common parent? happy days! EDELFLEDA (with emotion). And were they happy days to thee too, Egbert? EGBERT. Yes, they were days of thoughtless, unmix'd joy.— Hadst thou, sore press'd with sorrow, said to me, “Friend of my youth! thy help!”—Oh, Edelfleda! What had I not encounter'd in thy service? But thou desertest me—art my worst foe!— EDELFLEDA. I! I, thy foe?—I, who for thy sake live In torments, fiercer than e'er yet consumed The guiltiest wretch.—I, who but err'd in this, That yielding to our parents true obedience, I gave my heart where they had given my hand. EGBERT (distressed). Princess!—my heart—my hand—no longer mine,— How often with the secret on my lips, Sought I, ere this, to throw me at thy feet: But thy averted looks,—thy cold disdain— The sudden anger flashing on thy cheek— EDELFLEDA. Were the last struggles of expiring pride! And hast thou loved? nor know'st love's various language? Tremble, yes tremble, at the bound I've pass'd. Nothing remain'd to wretched Edelfleda But pride of soul, and that lies prostrate now. And dost thou think I will recede? No, Egbert! Triumph or death be mine! EGBERT. Triumph! o'er whom? EDELFLEDA. O'er her! the source of all my ill! o'er her!— Who, as the sweeping pestilence, unseen Stole o'er the tender germ, and blasted it, That, growing with our growth, unfolding fair, Had ripen'd into love, and made me blest! EGBERT. Hold, woman! would'st thou be a vengeful fury? And will my deadliest hate?—my soul's deep curse— EDELFLEDA. Thy hatred? yes—thy curse were far less bitter Than thus to see ye blest. EGBERT. Nay, Edelfleda, Be thyself again!—thou, once so generous! I, who have wrong'd thee, throw me on thy mercy! By the new faith that teaches sweet forgiveness! By my contrition for the outrage done To thy best feelings! By our early days Of childish fondness! By our common mother (For thou didst give her that endearing name!) And by her dying blessing o'er us breathed, As we together knelt and mingled tears! Oh! be thou great, as not to mortal frailty Has yet been given!—Princess, protect my wife! Enter Ina. INA. I hear his voice! 'tis he! my lord! my Egbert! [They embrace. Why kneel to her? why claim of her protection? And canst not thou protect me? thou, my husband! EGBERT. Alas! my love, I must on the instant hence; The army claims me, and the king commands. I can but fold thee to my faithful bosom. [They embrace in speechless emotion. My Ina!—oh! I would be firm.—I pray thee Tremble not thus.—Nay, smile—though forced the smile, It were a pious fraud, and my poor heart Will half deceive itself. INA (in great distress). My lord! my love! EDELFLEDA (aside). And must I witness the soft melting eye! Hear the endearing name! mark all their fondness! And thus learn each sweet several joy I lose! And is't of me he claims for her protection? Let justice take its course. He knows I love, And therefore must be mine: and for she knows it, My pride cannot consent that she should live. [Exit with Bertha. EGBERT. Alas! my love, to part with thee is hard; Never so hard before. Yet, my kind father, As if repentant of the angry haste With which he fasten'd ('twas but for a moment) Chains on thy Egbert, has even now dismiss'd me With gracious signs of sweet returning love— With fullest confidence—with ample powers.— Was it not generous? And think'st thou, Ina, I will not justify the noble trust? INA. Oh, yes! thou wilt a thousand, thousand fold. Heaven guard thee while this thought impels thy valour (As well I know it will) beyond all bounds Of prudence! Oh! when desperate, thou seek'st To pluck fair wreaths from danger's hideous brow, Think of thy Ina! of thy child! and check Thy daring rashness! EGBERT. Nay, it is that valour Thy love would chide, will best protect thy Egbert, Restore him worthy of thy tenderness! INA. And must I stay so near a treacherous court, And that fierce woman's hate, now all is known? EGBERT. My father will protect thee. INA. Can he, Egbert? Thou know'st the artful sway of cruel Baldred. Nay, let me go with thee!—See, Alwyn comes. Enter Alwyn. Plead for me, Alwyn, that I follow him. ALWYN. She must not stay, my friend—Thou art deceived, Thy father was too gentle. 'Tis not so, Howe'er the parent may relent—that kings Can wipe away all trace of injury. Go, then, my prince, as was appointed, wearing That open brow—a stranger to mistrust. When night shall close the eye of vigilance, And with her friendly mantle shroud our steps, I will steal forth with Ina, both conceal'd In such rude weeds as wrap the villager. INA. Thou art our guardian angel!—and my child? ALWYN. We will not leave him. On his mother's breast He shall be cradled. On the gentle steed Thou lov'st so well, for that he brought thy Egbert So often to thy arms, ye shall be placed, And I beside you will conduct your steps. EGBERT. How for a moment shall I leave thee, love, Now that a doubt—Oh, no! a doubt would wrong My father—yet—a fear—Love's idle fear— INA (with joy and eagerness). I have nor doubt, nor fear. I follow thee, My lord! my husband! thee, my all of bliss! And bear our mutual treasure in my arms! Rear'd softly, I ne'er knew life's rougher hour; Yet shalt thou find me as the rudest peasant, Hardy, and firm of nerve. If night should wrap Her brow in clouds, I'll bless the kinder shade Favouring our flight; or, if her lamp shine forth, I'll think it is to light me on my way. The howling wolf shall seem but as a friend, Scaring who may pursue me (for true love Never knew fear!) The blust'ring winds that meet me, I'll hail as eager messengers from thee; And, if they scatter from their ruffled wings The driving hail-storm on my houseless head, I will but lap our infant's mantle close, And say it is plain nature's ruder welcome. [Exeunt severally. ACT IV. SCENE I. CENULPH (alone). The cheerful day revives me. All night long In thousand changeful forms my labouring fancy Presented Sigiswold. The very smile Beam'd on me still—the smile he wore in death! He wrung my hand as then; and, as I gazed, He glared all ghastly, horrible. In agony I shook off sleep—again I sunk o'erwearied, And then methought my son came towering on, Nor touch'd the ground, but in contempt. Enter Osric. OSRIC. My liege! From royal Egbert messengers arrive. CENULPH. Conduct them hither. [Osric goes. My distemper'd thoughts bode nought but ill. Enter Edred. What tidings from the army? EDRED. Prince Egbert greets his father and his king With duteous love and firmest loyalty; Already to his banners throng thy subjects With ardour never witness'd. He had number'd Ten thousand men in arms ere he dismiss'd us. The peasant leaves the coulter in the furrow To snatch his battle-axe, or ponderous spear; The aged bowman, all unnerved by time, Grasps the tough yew he can no longer bend. Ev'n mothers bid their slender striplings arm, To follow their loved prince! their future king! CENULPH. Their future king! say they, “their future king?” Are they impatient that old Cenulph lives? It is enough. You may retire. [Exit Edred. The prince, Elated, thinks 'tis but to break a lance With Ethelbald, and gaily speed him back To love and Ina. [He appears in great agitation. Enter Baldred. Baldred, thou art welcome! I think thou art true, nor like the summer courtier, Dost more affect the prince than thy old master; Oswald I doubt, and Orgar.—The smooth Alwyn Is wholly his.—The father's tenderness Has, more than all, proved traitor to the king. Did I say king? Ah! king no longer, Baldred, Than it may please Prince Egbert! BALDRED. True, my liege; You have cause to fear him. CENULPH. Fear him! Fear my son? BALDRED. Yes, you do fear the prince, and you have cause; E'en the wolf's whelp will gambol round its dam With new life's graces:—but ere long, behold The blood-red eye-balls glare—the keen-hook'd fangs: Anon th' invaded fold, the slaughter'd flock. Yes, Egbert was a child—his father's darling— But now he is a prince, in manhood's prime, Bold, strong, ambitious—and the soldier's idol. CENULPH. Of Egbert's growing honours thou would'st speak, Nor aught infer of dark design. I said— I know not what—in moody vein. Thou hast seen The lambent lightnings flash o'er summer skies; E'en so a father for a moment chides. The ominous clouds must heap their sooty volumes, Shrouding the last blue space of hope, ere yet The bolt be sped in wrath. BALDRED. Nay, trust him till he pluck The diadem from thy time-silver'd brow. I can retire within my holy cell, That, self-defended in its sanctity, Not shameless vice shall dare to violate; Welcome to me the sacred fold I left! [Going. CENULPH. Stay, Baldred, stay! Think not I bar my ear Against thy counsel. Yes, my rebel son Must be reduced to duty and obedience. BALDRED. Then must his wanton, Ina, be removed! There is nor peace, nor safety for the realm, Till Egbert with the Mercian princess weds. 'Tis but to pluck this canker-worm away— CENULPH. And crush it underneath my foot, good Baldred? BALDRED. Rather, my liege, to holy keeping yield her. To the new faith devoted by strong vows, The veil shall shroud her from his sight for ever; And from her wiles escaped, the prince once more Is Wessex' heir, and Cenulph's duteous son. CENULPH. The marriage void declared, thyself shall lead And offer at the holy shrine the victim; But she must be compell'd herself to cancel The idle vow, or Egbert will not yield To wed as the high views of state demand. If she refuse—her doom is fix'd—she dies! BALDRED. Most wise! most just!—Yet had not I kept watch, She had escaped beneath a peasant's garb, By darkness favour'd. CENULPH. Thanks to thy vigilance! We must be prompt. But I would have the council Debate on this, and hear her on each charge— That all may know how just the king's decree. BALDRED. The lords, assembled, wait the royal presence. Ere yet they met, I sounded warily Each several bosom: they are well advised. They view with steady eye the general good, Nor mark the private pang. Leave all to them! 'Tis meet that Alwyn (though we know him false) Should hold his place among them: he will mark The father's wish to save, ere yet the king And prudent council doom the criminal. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Lords in Council. FIRST LORD. Methinks the holy abbot tarries long. SECOND LORD. King Cenulph loves his son. It were not easy, Perchance, to bring him to the point we wish. ALWYN (eagerly). King Cenulph was the father of his people! Then how much more the father of his child! Ere Baldred practised on declining age To sow dissension— THIRD LORD. Hark! I heard their steps. Cenulph enters with Baldred. They all rise. He takes his seat with due ceremony. CENULPH. Have ye, my lords, each several charge prepared Against this woman? that she may appear, And answer for her crime? MORDRED. We have, my liege. CENULPH. We do not wish that she be hardly dealt with, Nor would we pluck up by the roots a flower Our son has sometime foster'd with fond care, But rather place it, rich in blooming sweets, An offering on the shrine of public good. [The lords bow assent. Bring in the prisoner! [Ina is brought in, guarded. Holy abbot, speak! BALDRED. Daughter of Sigiswold, thou art summon'd hither, To answer to high charges brought against thee! Thou hast, by subtle and unlawful arts, Wrought on the royal heir of Wessex' throne, And drawn him from his true allegiance; That he hath broke the faith the king, his father, Had pledged for him, and thereby brought on us A bloody war, and on the throne dishonour. CENULPH. Speak, Ina, nor dissemble; thy confession May win stern justice to commit thy cause To mercy's hands. Say, was't by flatteries, By honied words thou didst so far prevail? INA. My king, my royal master! ever gracious! Thanks for thy gentler speech, that gives me time To wake and rouse my senses to these horrors, So new, so strange, around me, conjured up To terrify my weakness!— [A pause. My confession, And my defence, are one. On simple truth I rest. For my good father's services, Most honour'd Cenulph, and his happy death (For that he held it happy his last words, As ye all know, declared), I was advanced To attend your late loved consort. In her presence I often saw the prince, but practised nought Of what ye charge me with. I am not skill'd In arts unhallow'd, lords, nor even practised The arts less blamed of courtesy and smiles. Nay, when through all the realm one voice was heard Of gratulation on his martial deeds, Oh! when the widow's tears were dried to bless him! When age shook off its weight of years for joy! And children gambol'd round his homeward steps, While checking his proud steed he smil'd upon them! And when his boundless heart to all went forth, To age with filial love! to glowing youth With all a brother's warmth! To the fall'n foe With sadden'd grace, as though he blush'd at conquest! I still was silent—though sweet tears would gush To hear his praises from a nation's lips! [She appears overcome. ALWYN. It was a glorious triumph for a prince So young in war's dread lore! BALDRED. Such deeds more justly Had in a simple maid raised distant awe, Not the ambitious thought to match with him. INA. Still was I happy in my secret homage, (To blame alone in that it border'd much On what were due to Heaven) nor knew a wish Beyond what each ensuing hour now gave, To see him, hear him, and retain each word His gracious lips let fall; when, on a day, (How fortunate esteem'd till now!) the queen, For some slight instance of my duteous care— The prince assisting—said, “My children, thanks!” I met Prince Egbert's glance—it bore my fate! Confused, I hasten'd from the royal chamber. He follow'd me, and pour'd forth all his soul! For in those words he read the queen's consent; Nor did I otherwise interpret them, Who had no power to think but as he thought. You, royal Cenulph, then were on the borders, To treat with Ethelbald. When you return'd With Mercia's princess—I was Egbert's wife. CENULPH. Thy father's services are not forgotten, With which thou artfully dost usher in Thy tale of innocence. Although thy deed In any other were as treason censured, The worth of Sigiswold shall gloss it over, And I will pardon thee, if thou retire Within the walls of some far monastery, And take the holy vows that sever thee For ever from the world and all its ties. This, by thy free consent, and presently! Declaring void th' unsanction'd marriage. INA. King! I am a wife, and mother of a prince, Who must not blush, in riper years, to hear His mother's name. BALDRED. Dost thou, perverse and thankless, Turn from the outstretch'd hand of royal mercy? The law to death has doom'd thee. But the king Would snatch thee from thy fate, and we, his council, Applaud his deed; while thou, ungrateful woman!— INA. My lords, the sentence you declare as law I cannot have incurr'd. The prince is free: He is a man, and has the privilege Ye none of you would yield, to choose his mate! But if the claims of state demand my death, I, for my country's weal, can lay my head, Calmly as any of ye, on the block. A death so glorious, by my countrymen With grateful tears acknowledged, will not stain The name of her who bore your future king. BALDRED. Consider well. Delay is not allow'd. To-morrow, or the scaffold or the cloister! INA (with terror). And must I then, my lords, prepare for death? Nor see my husband—more? BALDRED. Thou never wilt see him thou hast named thus, Which e'er thou choose. [Seeing her overcome. Think of that tender frame, Moved thus by ills, as yet but faintly imaged! Oh! how will it sustain the real horrors Of infamous and public execution? While the outrageous populace throng round thee With curses loud, or haply, coarser pity? I marvel not to see thee shrink appall'd! Yes, shroud thy timid softness in the cloister, Where sister saints shall fold thee to their bosoms, From the rough world and all its ills secure. INA. Mock not, my lord, what nature's various hand Stampt on the weaker sex to set off yours! The finer texture of our nerves will thrill At horrid sounds: the changeful cheek will blanch, Though not with fear; or glow with crimson hue, Though not a thought less pure have stain'd the mind: And, though I tremble, lords, nor can support me— Nor can distinctly mark this awful presence (For in amazement swims my troubled vision); Yet does this frame, so fragile, bear a soul More constant than ye think, where youthful pride Both knows to make the choice which virtue prompts, And by that choice abide. 'Tis death, my lords; Dishonour never! BALDRED. Thou wilt think otherwise; Thou art not firm to meet the law's full rigour. INA. Baldred, I am! If what thou say'st be law: I must live honour'd as Prince Egbert's wife, Or must not live: and, when ye shed my blood, Remember, 'tis Prince Egbert's wife ye murder. May I retire, my liege, and wait my sentence? CENULPH. Attend her hence, Lord Oswald. Ina, mark, 'Tis thou who hast rejected offer'd mercy. [Exit Ina. Alwyn, thou see'st how vain it is to strive Against her firm resolve. ALWYN. Most firm, my liege, In honour's mid-day course. I thought no less Of one, though of the weaker sex, and gentlest Ev'n of the gentle—sprung of Sigiswold! BALDRED. Alwyn would say, the father's loyalty Sanctions the offspring's treason. CENULPH (to the lords, rising). In your hands I leave my seal: affix it to the sentence Your steadier judgment prompts. [Exit. OSWALD. Harsh the decree, howe'er expedient, lords; And pregnant too with danger that ye mark not. Prince Egbert holds the soldiers' hearts, and may Be driven to extremes. Though justice doom her, And the public safety, yet remorseful Be the stroke; nor chains, nor loathsome dungeons Add gloomier terrors to untimely fate! Be her own house her only prison, lords; And though ye place a trusty guard around it, Let her not be control'd in aught, save what Might furnish means to escape:—this mercy asks. LORDS. And justice yields.—No one objects to this. BALDRED. The impending danger, nay, the sure destruction Of this ill-fated land, if we avert not The sword of war, and this the only means, Have been well weigh'd before. Alas! my friends, The public danger suffers not delay. The child must die with her, or nought is done. Are we not all agreed? ALWYN. No. I, my lords! I dare protest against the bloody sentence! BALDRED. Alwyn, beware! 'Tis well known thou hast been Base pandar to Prince Egbert's worst excesses. What by my holy office I declare To be most just—most necessary—thou, Bold as thou art, wilt thou, at thy life's hazard, Vainly oppose? I do take shame, my lords, That this man's taunts should thus have moved my temper; I who have thrown aside the ruthless sword To bear the pastor's crook! who did forego The pride and pomp of war—the shout of triumph, For humble beads, and the low voice of prayer! Would I, my friends, would I have doom'd this lamb, Pride of my flock! but for the good of all? SECOND LORD. None doubt your pious motives, holy Baldred. BALDRED. In the fair cause of peace, 'tis Heaven's decree. ALWYN. I tell thee, proud remorseless priest—that Heaven, Thou would'st make 'complice of thy cruelty, Will baffle thee. Yes—the red bolt of vengeance Will find the guilty head beneath the cowl, As surely as the bare and houseless ruffian's, Who spoils the nightly traveller!—nor waits The swifter fire till tardy thunders warn! [Exit. [The scene closes on them as they are signing her sentence. ACT V. SCENE I. Ina's Bower. Ina, Osric, and Guards. INA. My home! thou scene of happiness! my home! (Oh! the sweet recollections in that word!) For the last time my eyes would fain retrace Each several spot so dear!—but blinding tears— [Seeing the guards, and shuddering. These savage men! good Osric, pray dismiss them— They gaze on me with bold, ungentle looks, That wear not the respect methinks were due To wretchedness like mine. OSRIC (makes signs they should retire). You are obey'd. INA. Is thy heart hard, that Baldred chooses thee To be my jailer? OSRIC. Lady, I'm a soldier, Command the troops that guard the royal person; And while I hold this charge, were my own father Entrusted to my keeping, I were firm. INA. And must the soldier know no touch of nature? OSRIC. I said not so. I meant but to declare The soldier's honour must not shrink, although His heart-strings burst. INA. Methinks, my lord Did show thee favour once? OSRIC. 'Twas on an outpost. Wounded, and left as dead, the tide of battle Roll'd onwards where I lay.—The prince was there (For he was every where, and ruled the fates), He placed me on his steed, supported, led me,— Himself deep wading through swoln Isis' flood, And gave me to a cottager in charge— Nay, thought of me in victory's madd'ning hour, And sent, ere night, one skill'd to close my wounds. Lady, if hard this heart, th' impression graved On hardest things is deepest, and most durable! INA. Thou'rt moved!—kind soul!—my grief, not I, did wrong thee. Sure thou couldst pity me! OSRIC. Oh! might I prove it! INA. Thou may'st! for though thou canst not spare my life, 'Tis thine to soften death. Thou, by thy office, Hast access ever to the royal presence. Conduct me to the king. OSRIC (astonished). Ha! say'st thou?—wherefore? INA. I would but claim a grandsire's pitying care For Egbert's—for thy benefactor's—child. Then look on death with such meek constancy As innocence may lend. OSRIC. Thou hast prevail'd. But, lady, wait—I pray you wait a space Till darker night close round, and the hush'd palace Assure no interruption.—'Tis but life I hazard here,—the soldier's honour safe! For Alwyn said the king forbade control, Save in what might afford thee means of freedom. INA. Thou generous man! thy precious life is sure; The prince at hazard of his own will guard it. But what of Alwyn? thou didst speak his name. OSRIC (giving her a dagger). He bade me give thee this; yet, charge thee, live If it be possible— INA (taking it eagerly). I understand him. [After looking at it with emotion, she goes to a table on which are emblems of worship. Here I shall offer up my last sad prayer When I return; and, if the secret voice Of conscience speak assent, yes,—I will hug thee, Horrible as thou art!—thou last best friend, That canst alone prevent the headsman's stroke. [Lays the dagger on the table. Here too I place my Egbert's pictured form, It might offend. [Takes a picture from her breast. And here, these gems, his tokens! [Places ornaments. They ill become the wretched supplicant To death devoted.— (Returning to Osric). Alwyn, where is he? I little thought that Alwyn would forsake me. OSRIC. Forsake thee? He! The cruel sentence pass'd, He flung him on the steed prepared for thee; And, with a madman's desperate course, he sped To seek thy Egbert. INA. Oh! 'twas rashly done! Had I but known his purpose, I had sent Some words of comfort,—of fallacious hope. Osric, my husband's bosom owns no thought Mine does not share. We are one heart! one mind! And the full tidings of my fate, pour'd forth With careless haste, will kill him. Oh! I know, Too well I know, alas! th' impetuous course Of all his soul's affections!— OSRIC. Nay, take comfort. Haply good Alwyn brings him to thy rescue. INA. The distance, Osric!—Will the wild winds lend Their rushing wings? OSRIC. Forestall not evils, lady. There's pity still in heaven! INA (looking out). See, my friend! The last pale lingering light has left the west. I will prepare me. OSRIC. I will wait you, lady. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Wood. Night. Baldred and armed Peasants. BALDRED. A thoughtless groom that tends on Alwyn's steeds Betray'd their course. They will pass through this wood: Conceal yourselves, my friends, and be ye sure The prince escape not. Egbert's death alone Can save you from the sword of Ethelbald. Think of your wives, your children, and your homes. Hark! I hear distant voices! to your stand. [They conceal themselves. Enter Egbert and Alwyn. EGBERT. Oh Alwyn! that my gallant steed should fail me! In Ina's rescue fail me!— ALWYN. Ere he sunk O' erwearied, he had measured half the realm! My fleetest coursers wait in yonder hamlet, Conceal'd by darkness and these tangled trees. Trust me, my lord; I know each knotted oak, Each bushy dell; and, though the moon refuse Her friendly beam, can guide your steps aright. [The peasants attack them. Egbert wards off their weapons, but does not strike them. EGBERT. Refrain these ruffian staves! hold, traitors! hold! I am your prince—your leader—and for you Have this day staked my blood on yonder plains. Stand off! forbear! I would not take the lives Of those for whom I fought beneath that sun, Gone down erewhile in crimson blushes wrapt, To hide him from your deed. [The peasants fall back, and then advance again tumultuously. On your allegiance! Ingratitude shames mercy from her softness! [They fall back again. Mistaken men! what villain set you on? Not of yourselves—ye men of Wessex!—no— Not of yourselves,—my countrymen! My fellow subjects!—and my fellow soldiers! Would ye attempt my life. I know you would not! I trust you ere ye speak. [Peasants fall at his feet. (Sheathing his sword). Who set you on? PEASANTS. A holy man declared you held at nought Our lives, our fortunes—and he bade us boldly By one great stroke secure them. EGBERT. “Boldly,” fellow! Is midnight murder bold? ye are abused— 'Tis at his country's foe the Briton strikes, And thus secures the blessings ye have named. PEASANTS. Oh! pardon—generous prince! our lives are yours. EGBERT (raising them). Away, poor knaves, away! ye were misled. I would not have the peering moon betray Some well-known aspect, and unwilling force me To do as justice points.—I pardon you— Depart—nor let me see you till in battle Ye on your country's foes redeem this deed. [As they are going off, Baldred steals behind Egbert with uplifted weapon. ALWYN (rushing on him, and seizing his arm). Ha! treacherous villain?—No! it cannot be A British breast I pierce!—Die—traitor, die! [Stabs him. BALDRED (falling). Detested Alwyn!—Is it thine—to wield— The threaten'd—bolt—of vengeance!— ALWYN. Baldred's voice? And didst thou wrap thee in the holy seeming Of peace and love for this? for secret murder? EGBERT. Unhappy Baldred! how had I deserved Thy deadly hate? BALDRED. As does the sun—himself— The hate—of all—heaven's glittering—host beside, And I—like them—would shun—thy hated—presence. Wilt—wilt thou—still-embitter—death's last pang, As thou hast poison'd—all—my course—of life. EGBERT. Yet live! oh live! accept my friendship, Baldred— My forgiveness!— BALDRED. Forgiveness—from the man—I hate? Ye demons! save me—from him—save—oh, save me! [Dies. ALWYN. So may th' unerring vengeance of high Heaven Still fall on those, who wrest the sacred cause To their dark purposes! EGBERT. Oh, Ina! Ina! Should this delay prove fatal!—On, my friend! [Exeunt. SCENE III. The King's Closet. CENULPH (alone). The midnight hour has toll'd! I fain would rest. Sleep flies these aching eyes! Why is it so? [He ruminates in a disturbed manner. It is not much that one be sacrificed To stay the sword of war. Yet, ere I press The downy couch, a painful something here, I would compose by my accustom'd prayer. I never yet have laid me down to rest, Unoffer'd to high Heaven the past day's deeds. Why do I seem less ready now to bend The humble knee? If, for my people's weal, This woman's death!—'tis well— [He kneels. Yes, I will kneel. I am alone with thee, my Maker! Thee! In whose sight all are equal—all thy creatures. [As he kneels down, Ina enters softly behind with her child, approaches unperceived as he speaks, and kneels beside him. INA. No; I am with thee, in thy Maker's presence! Like thee, his creature! and, if true thou say'st, Thy equal in his sight. CENULPH (with terror). Protect me, Heaven! Ha! is it past?—Avaunt! terrific vision! Com'st thou to charge me with thy blood? INA. No, king! I come to bow me at thy honour'd foot, And plead for thee, that thou wilt spare thyself. Oh! spare thy age, nor rob it of its staff, The blameless conscience! Of its graceful honours, Posterity! and children's children's blessings! CENULPH. Thou! thou dost bar me from the joys thou nam'st. They will be mine when thou art in the grave. How didst thou gain admittance at this hour? Who aided thee in this?—his life shall pay— INA. 'Twas He, to whom thou didst pour forth the prayer. He gave to innocence unwonted courage, And lent my suit the winning grace it needed. He, whose voice heaves the sea, and stills the storm— Bade every cruel passion to subside; And, as I pass'd, fashion'd each heart to pity. The gentle hand, unconscious of its act, Put back the pond'rous bolt!—With noiseless sweep The portal open'd, to admit a mother Bearing her orphan'd little one, to place him Beneath a grandsire's care. [Presenting the child. Protect this child! The heir of Wessex' throne! CENULPH. I will not look on't. Away, and take it hence!—It dies with thee. INA. Oh! say not so! Murder the rosy babe That smiles on thee? thy age's stay and hope! Thou, who not yet in wantonness of power Hast rioted in blood! not yet hast mock'd At nature's ties!—and at thy first essay To crimson thy hard hand with this! thy own! Nay, tremble, tyrant! tremble in thy turn Before a frantic mother!—Thou a father! Oh, yes! thou art, and father of a son, Whose infancy was dear as is this babe's. CENULPH. Yes, dear his infancy! his boyhood dearer! His youth my pride! my joy! till thy loose arts Wound sensuality's soft silken toils Around his soul.—Besotted in thy love, What crimes may he not perpetrate to soothe Thy woman's pride!—His father's throne—his life— Nay, hang not on me—thou'rt my bane, my curse. But thou art doom'd—of treasonous practices Convicted publicly.—Prepare for death! INA. I am prepared to meet death as becomes me; Although 'tis hard to die, so young, so loved! Thy Egbert, too, will find it hard to part. CENULPH. Shall the young eagle mate him with the raven, Nor, spurning the delusion, spring aloft, Bathing his plumes in the meridian ray To shake off foul pollution?—Think it not. INA. Nor think thou he can lose the wife he loves, Nor feel a pang. CENULPH. 'T will be forgotten soon. INA. And was the pang so soon forgot by thee, To lose thy virtuous queen, my gracious mistress? Though 'twas by nature's hand, matured for heaven By a long life of happiness and love! Not torn from thee, as must be Egbert's wife, In spring of bliss, but gently summon'd hence. CENULPH. No more of this. Fair Edelfleda's charms, With whom he weds— INA. Oh! never, never, king! He will not long survive.—Thus Edelfleda Will be appeased, and peace once more restored. Then will this child—Oh, look on him, King Cenulph! Then will this child remind thee of thy son. Fear not to look:—he but resembles Egbert.— He bears no feature of his wretched mother. His looks will waken none but grateful thoughts Of all that once was thine in Egbert's worth, Nor e'er remind thee of the deed of blood That stain'd thy long reign's close. CENULPH. I charge thee, hence! Was't I who will'd thy death? INA. It was myself! And I am firm to die with honour, rather Than live with fame attainted. Sigiswold, My father, died with honour. CENULPH (starting at the name). Sigiswold! INA. I am his daughter! and like him I die For thee, and for thy people.—If his blood, His faithful blood, that at thy feet flow'd forth, While thronging subjects hail'd thy rescued life! Have any claim upon a royal heart, (But, haply, nursed in soft prosperity, A king is not a man that he should pity!) Oh! in my father's name—to thee—my father! My Egbert's father, therefore mine, I sue. CENULPH. I'll hear no more—away! I have sworn thy death. INA. And I will die content—indeed I will, If thou wilt hear thy victim's dying prayer. Grant, grant, that I once more behold my husband! Oh! let thy Egbert once more see his child! And bless him, once, once more! Oh! let me see him, And parting, speak as holy wedded love, So rudely sever'd in its youthful prime, May prompt. This last, this sad, this little comfort, Canst thou refuse to her whose father saved thee? A mother! and a wife! whose throbbing breast Thy hand so soon will still for ever? CENULPH (groans). Oh! INA. Merciful God! thou dost wipe off a tear? Spite of thyself thou hast a father's heart! [Eagerly pressing the child towards him. Look on thy Egbert's child, and let me hear, Ere yet, at day-break, I lay down my life, A grandsire's blessing pour'd upon his head! [Cenulph snatches the child to his bosom. Ina contemplates them with rapture, then with trembling anxiety and hope. Father! and shall I see my Egbert too? CENULPH. Yes! thou shalt see him—nor for thousand worlds Shalt thou be torn from him! [Embraces her and the child together, with agonizing emotion—then Come, Ethelbald! In all thy terrors, come! I am prepared— I and my children will defy thy rage. EDRED (behind the scenes). Nay, let me pass. Ye shall not stay my steps. Monarchs would wish their slumbers ever broken By tidings such as these! (Entering). King Cenulph! joy! Th' invading host no longer threatens thee. While they advanced in insolence and pride, Dreaming of conquest—as the god of battles Prince Egbert came!—with skill, his powers dividing, He rush'd upon the foe from every side. Disorder'd, broken, they but fell on death Where'er they turn'd. 'Twas one wide slaughter all. Our brooks run crimson to th' affrighted sea! Our thirsty fallows drink of Mercian blood! Countless the prisoners!—Ethelbald is taken! Enter Edelfleda. EDELFLEDA. Egbert victorious!—Ethelbald in chains! And is it true? and am I quite undone? [Seeing Cenulph embrace Ina. What sight is this that blasts the blessed sense Of vision? doom'd to death a few hours since, Feeble old man, by thee and by thy council, I see her now, clasp'd in thy trembling arms, While tears of dotage o'er thy eye-balls swell. Stand I alone in the wide world?—no power That rules our fates to avenge or to protect me? Then will I be protector to myself! My own avenger!—independent—single— Supreme!—though but in misery and guilt! [She rushes to stab Ina. Cenulph seizes her arm, and the attendants surround her. CENULPH. Guard her, Lord Oswald, with respectful care.— This frantic act was but the effect of grief. INA. Soothe her, my lord. Who shall compassionate Her soul's distracted state if Ina do not? Oh! use not harsh constraint, lest she should feel Too heavy on her heart her father's chains, Her fortune's overthrow. EDELFLEDA. This ruffian grasp! And think ye, sirs, ye hold some lawless hind By sordid rapine stain'd?—I am a princess! A mighty monarch's daughter!—though dethroned— And sacred still my person!—Nay, unhand me. [They leave her. See, I am tranquil, king!— (To Ina). Nor tremble thou— One moment I forgot myself—no more— But to high Heaven belongs to judge the faults Of royal souls!—the royal soul itself, |Heaven's best interpreter!—and royal hands Alone shall execute Heaven's just decree! [Stabs herself. INA. Hold, hold her hand, Lord Oswald! 'tis too late! What hast thou done? EDELFLEDA. To Mercia's wretched princess I have secured an honourable death!— I could not live degraded!—thou or I— Must yield!—'tis mine—I will'd it so!—and now— (Which Edelfleda had not ask'd and lived) Thy pardon, Ina! INA. Oh! much-injured princess! Thou pardon rather the unworthy Ina That happiness it now seems guilt to own! EDELFLEDA. These torpid pulses, with—mad passion throb— No longer—all—is calm—and cold—tell Egbert— I—dying—bless'd—your loves!—I pray—you—both— Think—kindly—sometimes—kindly—speak—of me— CENULPH. Oh! Edelfleda! rash, unhappy maid! Thy hand has dash'd from thee exalted good; The good congenial to thy lofty spirit! Seated on Mercia's throne, thy soul of love Had in a people's bliss secured thy own. EDELFLEDA. No, monarch—no; there is—no bliss—for one— Who—loving virtue, but—by passion—driven— To worst—extremes—can never—never—more Honour—herself.—Oh! let—the quiet—grave— Close o'er—my sorrows—and my—fault. That pang!— And now—I rest— [Dies. INA. Oh Heaven! her soul is fled! CENULPH. Poor Edelfleda! Summon her attendants! Good Bertha, bear her hence; apply each means If yet a lingering breath of life— EDRED. My liege, We fear some ill may have befallen Prince Egbert. CENULPH. Where is he? Comes he not? EDRED. There came a man, With visor down—in breathless haste he came; They spoke apart with gestures violent, And sudden sped together o'er the plain. INA. 'Twas to his heart's dear home my Egbert sped! He will be there ere we can reach it, father! [She rushes out, Cenulph follows. SCENE IV. Ina's House. Enter Egbert and Alwyn hastily. EGBERT. I am here, my love! they shall not tear thee from me! Thy husband will defend thee from the world! My love! my wife! where art thou? ALWYN (alarmed). My good lord, Strange silence reigns around. They sleep, perhaps— The menial train. The night is far advanced. I pray you rest you here: I will awake them. Haply thy Ina too enjoys repose— For sleep will visit suffering innocence. EGBERT. Haste thee, my friend, and rouse the drowsy sluggards. [Exit Alwyn. (Going to a door) This is her chamber. Those loved eyes have wept, Till, as the infant's, they have closed in sleep. I'll enter softly, and will whisper peace; Till, by degrees, she wake to the full sense Of all our joy. [He enters, and returns. She is not there!—Nor wife! Nor child is there! Nor Alice—all is still! Where am I?—(faltering). (Starting.) Ina!—Is it possible? (With violence.) My love! my wife! my Ina! Enter Blanch. EGBERT. Where is thy mistress? BLANCH. Some hours have pass'd since she departed hence, With Alice and her infant, good my lord. EGBERT (distracted). Say how? say whither?—Speak—be brief! BLANCH. My lord, The guard and Osric waited on her steps; With locks dishevell'd, wrapt in sable weeds, Weeping she went, alas! we know not whither. EGBERT. Hush! speak no more—thy every word is death! [Exit Blanch. [After a pause, in which he appears violently agitated. Am I still living? Had we not one being? Beats still my heart? and not responsive beats, In each pulsation, throb for throb to hers? [With revived hope. It cannot be: I yet shall find her— [Sees the table, with the dagger, picture, &amp;c. What see I here? Her holy book of prayer? A dagger placed beside it! and my portrait, That never had forsook her living bosom! The tokens of my love too!—Tyrant father! And ye, ye men of blood! [He weeps. She is with angels! Yet still unblest without her Egbert! Thus She summons me, and gives the means—and thus, Thus, my soul's love, thy husband follows thee. [Stabs himself. Enter Alwyn. ALWYN. She is gone forth; but yet I nothing doubt: I with redoubled diligence will search— We yet shall find her. EGBERT. I—shall—find her soon! ALWYN. Why, why, my friend, that ghastly aspect? why Those tottering steps? What hast thou done?—A poniard! EGBERT. I could not live—she beckon'd—from the skies— I let my spirit—forth—that else—had burst— With ruder shock—its prison. ALWYN. Mercy! Heaven! INA (behind the scenes). And is he come? Oh joy! Where—where is he? My husband! Egbert! (Entering). See—I live! I live! [He sinks into Alwyn's arms. He sinks! Too mighty the o'erwhelming joy! Softly, good Alwyn—softly—place him here— [She helps to support him, and he rests his head on her bosom. A moment yet—his senses will return— Let all be hush'd around. [After a pause, in low tender accents. My love! my husband! 'Tis thy own Ina—We are happy, Egbert! EGBERT (reviving). Is death but this? Have I already past The dreaded bourne? And does thy sainted spirit Bend to receive me in the blest abodes? How easy death! INA. Talk not of death—we live, And we are blest beyond our fondest wish— We are forgiven—The good Cenulph loves me, Has clasp'd thy wife, thy infant to his bosom! [A pause. A little moment, friends—his mind not yet Can compass our immensity of bliss. Ha! while I speak of joy thy cheek grows pale: Methinks no gladness beams in those dear eyes. Thou art very ill!—thy looks are wild and sad. Come, father, come. Enter Cenulph. CENULPH. My son! my victor son! EGBERT. My father too! Oh that I yet might live! CENULPH. What has befallen? Is not all well with thee? My age's prop! My noble, valiant son! INA (screams). Here's blood! EGBERT. Oh! Ina—this rash—desperate—hand Has dash'd—dash'd to the earth—our cup of joy. 'Tis here—'tis here—cold—cold—and I must die. Have mercy, Heaven!—one—little hour—of life Were worth—but 'twill not be—I'm sick—to death. CENULPH. Haste—seek—bring aid—my throne, my treasure, all, All shall be his who first brings timely aid. EGBERT. 'Tis vain, my father—Oh! the stroke—was—home— Pardon—Oh! pardon—that I could—misjudge A father's heart! My love—my wife—be patient— Oh! father—bid her live—to warn—our child— From—passion's—headlong—course.— [Stretches his hand to Alwyn. My friend!—Oh! Ina! Where art thou?—I nor see—nor feel—I sink— Hold fast—my hand!—My wife—my Ina—Oh! [Dies. She falls on the body, and the Curtain drops. EPILOGUE, BY THOMAS MOORE, Esq. Last night, as lonely o'er my fire I sat, Thinking of cues, starts, exits, and—all that; And wondering much what little knavish sprite Had put it first in women's heads to write; Sudden I saw—as in some witching dream— A bright blue Glory round my book-case beam; From whose quick-opening folds of azure light, Out flew a tiny Form, as small and bright As Puck the Fairy, when he pops his head, Some sunny morning, from a violet bed: “Bless me!” (I starting, cried) “what Imp are you?”— “A small He-devil, ma'am—my name, Bas Bleu— “A bookish Sprite, much giv'n to routs and reading,— “'Tis I who teach your spinster of high breeding “The reigning taste in chemistry and caps, “The last new bounds of tuckers and of maps; “And, when the waltz has twirl'd her giddy brain, “With metaphysics twirl it back again!” I view'd him as he spoke—his hose were blue, His wings—the covers of the last Review— Cerulean, bordered with a jaundice hue, And tinsell'd gaily o'er, for evening wear, Till the next quarter brings a new-fledged pair. “Inspired by me!” (pursued this waggish Fairy) “That best of wives and Sapphos, Lady Mary, “Votary alike of Crispin and the Muse, “Makes her own splay-foot epigrams and shoes. “For me the eyes of young Camilla shine, “And mingle love's blue brilliancies with mine; “For me she sits apart, from coxcombs shrinking, “Looks wise, the pretty soul! and thinks she's thinking. “By my advice, Miss Indigo attends “Lectures on Memory, and assures her friends, “'Pon honour! (mimicks) nothing can surpass the plan “Of that Professor—(trying to recollect) psha!—that Memory-man,— “That—what's his name?—him I attended lately— “Pon honour, he improved my memory greatly.”'— Here, courtseying low, I ask'd the blue-legg'd sprite What share he had in this our play to-night? “Nay, there,” he cried, “there I am guiltless quite; “What! choose a heroine from that Gothic time, “When no one waltz'd, and none but monks could rhyme: “When lovely Woman, all unschool'd and wild, “Blush'd without art, and without culture smiled; “Simple as flowers, while yet unclass'd they shone, “Ere Science call'd their brilliant world her own, “Ranged the wild rosy things in learned orders, “And fill'd with Greek the garden's blushing borders!— “No—no—your gentle Inas will not do— To-morrow evening, when the lights burn blue, I'll come—(pointing downwards) you understand—till then, adieu!” And has the Sprite been here?—no—jests apart— Howe'er man rules in science and in art, The sphere of woman's glory is the heart; And, if our Muse have sketch'd, with pencil true, The wife—the mother—firm, yet gentle too;— Whose soul, wrapp'd up in ties itself hath spun, Trembles, if touch'd in the remotest one!— Who loves,—yet dares ev'n Love himself disown, When Honour's broken shaft supports his throne;— If such our Ina, she may scorn the evils, Dire as they are, of Critics, and—Blue Devils! XARIFA, A TRAGIC DRAMA. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Abdallah, king of Granada. Moraizel, of the race of the Aben-Zurrahs, leader of the troops, and father of Xarifa. Albin Hamad, nephew to Moraizel, and betrothed to Xarifa. Alhamut, Moorish knight of the race of the Zegris, at enmity with the Aben-Zurrahs. Ali, Moorish knight of the race of the Zegris, at enmity with the Aben-Zurrahs. Don Juan de Chacon, the Spanish general. Don Diego. Xarifa, betrothed to Albin Hamad. Esperanza, a Spanish slave, her attendant. Moorish and Spanish Soldiers, Guards, &amp;c. SCENE, Granada, and the Spanish camp under the walls of the city. For the fable, see page 340, “Historia de las Guerras de Granada.” ACT I. SCENE I. Scene on the walls of the city overlooking the field of battle. On the distant hills is seen the Spanish camp. Moors pass hastily across the stage, and look anxiously over the walls on the combatants beneath. Two Moors come forward from the crowd. FIRST MOOR. They yield—they yield on all sides to the foe! SECOND MOOR. Their ranks are broke. THIRD MOOR (from the walls). Mark, yonder on the left They make a stand.— FOURTH MOOR (on the walls). 'Tis but to check the bands Of fierce Castilians pressing on the rear. And see! our friends along the valley pour With breathless speed— THIRD MOOR. They throng the eastern gate! FIRST MOOR. Granada! oh my country! woe for thee! Press'd by the foe without—within thy walls Tumult and civil strife! The envious Zegris! They have fall'n off to blast Moraizel's fame, The Aben-Zurrah chief who led them forth! SECOND MOOR. The chief is brave, but bends beneath his years: Youth's fire is quench'd. Had Albin Hamad led The morning's onset, it had not been thus. He is alike of Aben-Zurrah lineage, Nor envy prompts my speech. FIRST MOOR. True, he is nobly gifted: yet, methinks, Of youth too green, too confident, too rash, To hold a leader's charge; but I will haste And meet our hapless friends, of them to learn The worst that has befallen. SECOND MOOR. 'Tis well advised. And see—the beauteous daughter of Moraizel, With hurried step, disorder'd, and her train Of Moorish damsels, on the ramparts throng. FIRST MOOR. The clamorous grief of women is not music To the dull ear of age. I will avoid them. [Exeunt two Moors. The train of women are looking anxiously over the battlements, with actions expressive of various emotions, while Xarifa, as if unable to bear the sight any longer, totters forward, supported by Esperanza. XARIFA. Look, Esperanza, look:—survey the field— Say, is the last sad remnant of our troops Received within the gates? ESPERANZA (after looking over the walls, returns). Alas! dear mistress, Few, few remain upon the fatal plain, Save those who never more— XARIFA (hiding her eyes). Oh dreadful sight! Confused through tears, the hill, the valley, all To me appears one mingled mass of horror. Yet look again—thou hast no father there! See'st thou the milk-white steed, the crimson vest, The lofty turban, ensign of command? ESPERANZA (looks again, and returns). Alas! no—nothing. But, perchance, Moraizel, When treacherous fortune frown'd upon his arms, With the first band return'd. XARIFA (indignant). Ha! Esperanza, Speak'st thou of brave Moraizel?—of my father? ESPERANZA. Pardon, dear mistress; I would calm thy fears, And weigh not well my words. XARIFA (kindly). Thy thought was kind; Yet, Esperanza, know, although 'tis hard To tremble for his life, 'twere not relief To deem his glory tarnish'd. ESPERANZA. Yet be patient. The valiant Albin Hamad will, ere long, Bring tidings fraught with comfort. Well thou know'st The band he leads this morning went not forth. And is it not some joy to think that he, The faithful youth, thy bosom's chosen lord, Was spared a part in this disastrous day? XARIFA. Thy gentle cunning now has touch'd the theme That best might soothe my cares. I thank thee, friend; But Albin Hamad tarries long, methinks: To-day his post was at the eastern gate. ESPERANZA. E'en while I look'd, the eastern gate was closed. XARIFA. Then is he free to come. Does he forget How dear her father to Xarifa? ESPERANZA. Nay, Since the eastern gate was closed, an arrow's flight Had scarce the distance measured—and behold, Unjust Xarifa! Albin Hamad comes. Hamad enters, takes Xarifa's hand, and appears unable to speak. HAMAD. Xarifa! oh! XARIFA (terrified). Thou canst not speak thy tidings! HAMAD. Our troops repulsed with loss— XARIFA. But say—my father!— Speak!—how fares Moraizel? HAMAD (clasping his hands). Good Moraizel! XARIFA. Have pity yet. Oh say not he is slain! HAMAD. No, dear Xarifa, no!—thy father lives! XARIFA. All powerful Heaven, thanks!—But yet methinks Thy looks, thy tone of sadness, ill accord With these glad tidings. Oh my fears! he is wounded? HAMAD. Not so.—The scars that grace the hoary chief Bleed not afresh! XARIFA. Then all, methinks, were well, If Hamad's brow but wore its wonted cheer; And I to-morrow—so my father bade— Should vow to Hamad all a wife's obedience. HAMAD. For us to-morrow is no day of joy. XARIFA. Ah! wherefore? wherefore?—Is it Hamad speaks? HAMAD. Could'st thou know joy, Moraizel far away? Say, who but he can give Xarifa's hand? XARIFA. Nor slain! nor wounded! Yet these dreadful words! Oh! worse than all!—a captive— HAMAD. Doom'd to chains Those noble hands from youth to veteran age Used but to wield the terror-flashing sabre, Till now so fatal to Granada's foes! XARIFA. What! fasten chains on him?—Oh no, they durst not— They durst not for their lives!—His eye, in anger, Would dash their hardihood. His reverend head Wears awe and strong control: no, their rude hands Would slacken—but thou smil'st in tender pity. Are they so hard?—have they no mercy?—none! And will they tear the father from his child? [After an agony of tears. Has filial love but unavailing tears To give a father? Yes, it has—it has A worthier boon! Farewell, my Albin Hamad! Yes, I must follow in captivity My honour'd father. From my infant years I have been his heart's best joy! he told me so But yesterday, and press'd me to his bosom. His tears fell on my tresses as he spoke, And then he thought but to have given me, Hamad, To thee and happiness! 'Tis mine to follow, And in the stranger's land to tend his age. Nay, stay me not! HAMAD (detaining her). Thy looks and words how wild! Think of the guarded walls that bar thy way! Think of thy youth! thy sex! thy matchless beauty! Thou would'st but rush on danger, or dishonour, The sport, the mock of brutal, pitiless men! Spurn'd haply by their chief! the haughty Juan! ESPERANZA. Oh, speak not thus!—Born in Andalusia, The blood my parents gave me swells my heart To hear my generous countrymen so slander'd. While I was yet a child in Carthagena, Don Juan was the universal theme For deeds of courtesy no less than valour. XARIFA. Pardon, good Esperanza! (To Hamad). Yes, full oft She has with tales of noble Juan's worth Beguiled the heavy hour—and portray'd him As one who own'd, beneath a soldier's sternness, The kindliest feelings: e'en so gently temper'd, That when war's clarion ceased to rend the air, His ear would drink the lute's soft mingled sounds, Till he was lost in pleasing ecstacy; And he would lend his fancy to the tale Of fabled woe, till from his ardent eye Big tears would follow each disastrous chance. ESPERANZA. Oft have I seen it! Oh that he were here! And young, and pitiful as then! XARIFA. Ha! “pitiful!” Was that thy word? and “would that he were here,” Said'st thou?—Thou thinkest then Xarifa's plaint Might touch in noble Juan's heart the string Would answer to the lute, were she to plead As filial love should prompt? ESPERANZA. My life upon it! XARIFA (with enthusiasm). Thanks, Esperanza, thanks! Dear Hamad, come! Honour and knighthood shall protect and guard The suppliant and the woman! Come, away! Yes, I will throw me at the victor's feet, Prone in the dust, and clinging to his knees, Will claim my father with an orphan's cry! HAMAD. Thou art inspired! Thy ardent eye, thy words Burn with a fire the prophet's self has lent! My soul has caught thy hope! all fear is fled! Thy promised husband, I attend thy steps. Let us go forth— [During this speech the King, Alhamut, and attendants, appear on the battlements. As Hamad is leading Xarifa off he sees them. Ha! yonder walks the king, With looks disturb'd! I would avoid his eye. My love, why didst thou stray so near the tower Whence 'tis his custom to survey the plain? XARIFA. Led on by anxious fears, and step by step— But whither shall we turn? The king has mark'd us! See—he approaches! Let us stand apart. The King advances in conversation with Alhamut. KING. The flower of my warlike bands mow'd down; Moraizel taken, say'st thou? ALHAMUT (with affected sorrow). Even so! Yet gallantly, my liege, your troops bore on, Till their brave leader lost, their order broken— KING. No more!—For this we must not to the foe Present a heavy brow, and hang the head; But with to-morrow's sun, in prouder cheer, Pour from the gates, and bear ourselves in all As men who follow up late victory. (Observing Hamad and Xarifa avoiding him). Young Albin Hamad—is it not? Draw near— Yet nearer— [Takes him aside, watching Xarifa. Noble youth, who is yon fair one Who from my presence would withdraw close-veil'd? HAMAD. My liege, she is the daughter of Moraizel, And weeps her father's fate. KING. Tell her the king Partakes her grief. Conduct her hither, Hamad. (Aside). Fame speaks her passing fair; 'tis haply, therefore, Secluded from my sight, her father ever Would find some specious reason— [Hamad leads her forward, veiled. Gentle mourner, Teach me how best to soothe thy virtuous sorrow; But first, I pray, remove thy folding veil, That I may read thy story in thy eyes, And sympathize ere thou canst speak thy pain. [She meekly unveils; the King starts. Ha! Fame has wrong'd thee much, bright excellence! XARIFA. Give me thy royal sanction, great Abdallah! That I go forth and seek the Spanish chief; Bow'd at his feet redeem my captive father, Or follow him, and share his chains. KING. Nay, rather stay where never chains shall bind Those graceful limbs, save such as Love may weave Of thornless roses, and unfading myrtle: Thou art too fair to meet the lawless gaze Of mail-clad ruffians. By Mahomet, methinks, Should the bold winds too rudely kiss that cheek, Or flutter on those lips with fond delay, They were my envy! XARIFA. King! these flattering words Distasteful strike on misery's sicken'd sense. I do entreat your royal nobleness, Let my soul's honest purpose but have way: A secret voice within my bosom whispers Assurance of success. KING. To dry those tears My coffers shall be tax'd for boundless ransom! XARIFA. Pardon, my liege; methinks that proffer'd gold Were held offence to knighthood. KING. Yet be cheer'd, A monarch's suit shall soothe the Spaniard's pride! A monarch's awe strike off thy father's chains! XARIFA. The orphan's prayer will oft times more prevail O'er sterner tempers than a monarch's awe. Fierceness itself in lions, and in wolves, Has pitying stoop'd to infant innocence; And haughtiest spirits put not on defence When lowliness assails. KING. There is no spirit So savage, or so brutal, could resist Thy sweet persuasion! Reason sinks abash'd, Robb'd of her argument, and wisest deems Whate'er wild fancy counsels by thy voice. Then be it as thou wilt:—but come thyself, And bring thy rescued father to my presence; From thy hand only will his king receive him. (To Hamad). Tend her, brave Hamad, as a sacred trust Committed by Abdallah to thy faith. HAMAD (indignant). Moraizel's daughter is a charge so precious To Hamad's faith, not thou canst make it more so! KING (indignant). Ha! heard I well? was it a subject spoke? XARIFA (anxiously interposing). From childhood he has honour'd—loved my father. Great king! his eager thought is gone before; And for the Spaniard's ear that firmer tone— KING. 'Tis well, sweet maid! since thou wilt have it so. XARIFA. Thanks, gracious king! Permit me to retire. [As she goes with Hamad and Esperanza, he gazes after her. KING. And must it be?—so soon?—Alhamut, mark Her graceful carriage!—Sure she treads in air, And draws the willing spirit from my bosom To float the way she leads. I never yet Beheld the form so robb'd me of myself. ALHAMUT. The maid is fair, I grant.—Yet think, my liege, How many fairer share your smiles already. The gentle Miriam! Shall another rival Dim her dark eyes with tears? Circassia's maid! Whose bosom scarce has ceased to heave with sighs For her lost country, and the home she loved. The blue-eyed Christian damsel, so demure, Who with her faith so prettily waged war In Love's victorious cause! KING (not attending to him). Did'st thou speak her name? ALHAMUT (with suppressed vexation). They call the maid Who parted hence, Xarifa. (Aside). Blast her charms! His soul is fired! KING (thoughtful). Young Hamad—is't not so?— Is kinsman to the maid.—How near of blood, That she should be “so precious to his faith?” ALHAMUT. He was bequeathed an infant to Moraizel By a loved sister, twice ten winters since In sack'd Cardela lost; and with his daughter, The orphan youth has shared a father's care. KING. 'Tis well.—How gracefully she shrunk, abash'd, From my too ardent gaze! What hidden power Lurk'd in her meek deportment, so to o'erawe My sovereign will that would have stay'd her steps, Yet fear'd to offend? I have heard of potent spells, Of fascination strange, ta'en by the eyes, That fetters fast each limb, locks up all use Of wholesome judgment. ALHAMUT. Yes—I have heard it said— The prophet's foes know to compel foul spirits By charms, and magic, and unholy things, Unto their service. KING. What would'st thou infer? Why dost thou measure me with anxious looks And broken speech? Give utterance to thy thought. ALHAMUT. The Christian slave, who waited on Xarifa, Is much suspected to have won her youth From the pure Moslem faith to rites abhorr'd; And it should seem, my liege, to see you thus— Let not my loyalty and love offend! Might I presume to urge a timely counsel, Admit her not again. KING. Peace, slanderer, peace! We know the enmity you Zegri knights Bear to Moraizel, and the Aben-Zurrahs. Now, by my faith, the maid should rather seem Graced by the prophet's self with gifts so rare, The chosen houri of his blissful hours, Than faithless to his worship. Ha! thou smil'st, And bit'st thy lip the while.—Leave me, Alhamut; (Aside.) Must a king ever be surrounded thus By prying eyes, officious, that would scan His inmost thought? [Going, Alhamut follows humbly; the King waves him off. I would not be attended. [Exit. [Alhamut remains confounded—to him Ali. ALI. Alhamut, thou art disturbed. Hast thou not heard The proud Moraizel's ta'en?—our hated foe, Abdallah's favour'd chief. ALHAMUT (impatiently). I know it all. ALI. Oh! 'twas well done!—Our faithful Zegris mark'd The chief o'erpower'd by numbers, yet delay'd— ALHAMUT. Tush! what avails it?—Even now his daughter— Perdition seize her charms!—with tears and sighs— ALI. Well may she weep her sire and fortunes lost! ALHAMUT. We, we have cause to weep. Abdallah saw her: I mark'd the subtle fire that sudden stole Through all his frame. The slave of lawless passion! Yet skill'd to bend each adverse circumstance, By deepest art to work his soul's dark purpose, That so his tyrannous will may wear the semblance Of strong necessity!—Was't not enough The Aben-Zurrah chief should lead the battle, While in the scabbard slept perforce our sabres, Forbid to dim the lustre of his deeds; But now his daughter with her blandishments Shall trick defeat in triumph's wreaths, and bring him To claim a victor's meed?—We are undone. With frowns the king forbade my due attendance. Displeased he parted hence. ALI. Our hopes are blasted. What! of the Aben-Zurrah race, shall she, She—curses on her!—rule Abdallah's breast, And lord it o'er us?—No—it shall not be! ALHAMUT. It shall not be—brave Ali, we have said it— No, perish first the Zegris man by man! [Exeunt. ACT II. SCENE I. The Spanish Camp. Don Juan, Diego, and Spanish troops. Moraizel and Moorish prisoners. JUAN. How fare our wounded friends? DIEGO. Their gashes bound, In eager thought, already, noble Juan, Beneath thy banners they renew the fight. JUAN. Lead on the prisoners. [The prisoners pass in review. So! prepare an escort To guide them to th' interior of Castile. Come hither, Diego. Takes Diego apart. He, the Moorish chief, Our noble captive, let his reverend age Claim due observance. Said'st thou not, he is Of Aben-zurrah lineage? DIEGO. True, my lord. But why thus moved? JUAN. The very name, good Diego, Awakens recollections twice ten years Have not yet lull'd. My loved, my lost Daraxa! It was her boast the Aben-zurrah's blood Enrich'd her veins! DIEGO. Daraxa!—So you call'd A Moorish maid, the choicest spoil you bore From sack'd Cardela's walls. JUAN. We loved, Diego, And seal'd by holy ties our mutual vows. Spain's sovereign claim'd my service on the sudden. My cruel father, in my absence, wrought To annul the bond with one of Moslem faith. She could not brook dishonour!—fled, and, dying, Consign'd the pledge of our unhappy loves To one—'twas all I e'er could learn—who swore To rear the boy in my Daraxa's faith: Or who, or where, nor if he live, I know not. Ha! who are these? and this low bending train Veil'd from my view? Hamad, Xarifa, and a train of Moorish damsels, enter from the back of the stage while he is speaking, and throw themselves at Juan's feet. HAMAD AND XARIFA. Mercy, victorious Juan! Mercy, Christian! XARIFA (on seeing her father, starts up and runs to him). My father! my dear father! MORAIZEL. Xarifa! Oh, my child! Why art thou here In hostile camps? Why from thy peaceful home? XARIFA. The daughter's home is by her parent's side. [Throwing herself on his bosom. Now—now, my father, is thy child at home! MORAIZEL. Quit the defenceless bosom of a captive! Why would'st thou rob me of a soldier's firmness? Return—return! XARIFA. Never without my father! MORAIZEL. Nay, loose thy tender grasp! (To Juan). As thou art brave, Give her safe convoy to the city's walls. I am prepared to meet my fate. The arm That could no longer guard this aged head, Is justly doom'd to wield no more the sabre. Farewell, my child!—Lead on. XARIFA (at JUAN'S feet). Victorious chief! Never was valour link'd with cruelty: The generous foe conquers to spare; for victory, Not slaughter, thirsts his spirit; and sweet mercy, The glorious labour o'er, claims all his soul! JUAN. Yet victory may bear foul slaughter's name, If wisdom fail to profit by her gifts. XARIFA. Wisdom and Mercy still go hand in hand. Wisdom is not so stern to bar thy ear Against the orphan's prayer; and Mercy ever Showers her own gifts on those whom she has school'd: Then give a father to a daughter's tears! JUAN. Trust me, fair Moor, I pity thy distress; But shall the leader of the Christians, leagued To war against the infidels, release The captured chief who led th' embattled foe? Thou mock'st me, lovely maid;—it must not be. XARIFA. Oh then, deny me not to follow him! Bold as he is, and dreadful in the fight, See, he is bent with years—his locks are silver'd! Sickness not yet impairs his veteran strength, But now, methinks, will find the access easy To one heart-stricken. Then let me be near! These hands can best prepare the cooling draught, Or bind the aching brow. [Juan turns away. Turn, noble Juan! Hast thou no little ones, whose lisped love Has taught thy heart how dear the tie that binds The father and his child? JUAN. Sweet pleader, no; To all domestic ties—long—long a stranger. XARIFA. Owns not thy bosom one dear bond of nature May wake thy sympathy for private sorrow? JUAN (with a heavy sigh). Not one. I am but a soldier. [As she presses towards him, observing his emotion, he turns from her. Nay, fair maid! XARIFA. No, not the unbending brow, the haughty carriage Stern war must needs assume, can still the voice Of nature in thy breast. Thou hast a heart! Oh yes! it beats in secret for my pain! I have no other parent, noble Juan, And twice am orphan'd if thou tear him from me. [As Juan strives to get from her, Hamad rushes forward. HAMAD. Behold, hard Spaniard, one in youth's full prime, The promised husband of this maid! These limbs, These suppler limbs, in all their pith and strength, Shall wear her father's chains—But give Moraizel, Oh give him to her tears! JUAN. Shall I be baited? Though knighthood doff the helm to suppliant beauty, To thee, bold youth, I am the Spanish chief! XARIFA (hanging on HAMAD'S arm, while he and JUAN fix each other). And would'st thou leave me, Hamad? this thy love? HAMAD. Proud victor, yes!—to thee, the Spanish chief, Boldly I say, accept my hardier youth. JUAN (aside). He has a look that powerfully pleads. XARIFA (to JUAN). Oh! spare my husband! Say, shall I be widow'd Ere yet the vow be breathed that makes me his? Brave Juan, hadst thou known the tie that binds Two faithful hearts, thou would'st not sever us. JUAN (aside). Oh memory! I thought the chords were snapt That vibrate here to agony! MORAIZEL (interposing). No more! Return, my children, with a father's blessing. XARIFA. No, no, my father, never will I quit thee. MORAIZEL. And wilt thou, faithless, rather leave thy husband? XARIFA. Faithless to Hamad?—No, may Heaven's bolt Fall on my perjured head, if e'er in thought, In word, or deed, I wrong my chosen lord, The husband thou, my father, bad'st me love! MORAIZEL (joining their hands). Hamad, lead hence thy wife. HAMAD. Moraizel, thou Lead hence thy daughter. JUAN (who has watched HAMAD during this debate). It should seem, methinks, That I have met his ardent eye ere now. But where?—'tis as a dream. HAMAD (earnestly to JUAN). See, at thy feet I ask Moraizel's chains. XARIFA (in the same supplicating attitude by his side). The faithful wife Follows her husband's fortunes. So the father His daughter's duty points. MORAIZEL. And would my children on my white head heap Such wretchedness? bereft of all I love, To drain the dregs of age's tasteless cup! Such foul dishonour, as to hold these days, So few, so sad,—I will not say of life,— At such a price!—am I so poor of soul? To nature recreant? the shame of knighthood? I blush, brave Juan, at this idle strife: Lead on—lead on. JUAN (aside, after a conflict). No, not for worlds by me Shall their young loves be torn asunder. (To Xarifa). Rise! Rise, lovely maid! I am not, as ye think, Of stuff impenetrable, noble Moors! Used but to scenes of blood, this gentler war Of loving hearts makes Victory dash the wreath From her vain brow, and deem her honours poor. (Presenting Moraizel to Xarifa). Lady, receive thy father. Still a captive, Be thou his only jailer. Thou forbid That he against us lead Granada's troops. XARIFA. How poor are words to speak my bursting soul! MORAIZEL. Oh generous! great!—believe an old man's tears! JUAN (to HAMAD). Thou, noble youth, art free. We claim no slaves Save those in battle taken. No restraint Can I impose, with justice, on thy valour: Yet let me pray thee, husband of Xarifa, Avoid Don Juan in the bloody strife. The time may come when war, as 'twere a beast Of prey o'ergorged, may sleep, and then I would That we might meet as friends. HAMAD. Thus bound to thee, Heaven's swiftest lightning sure would blast this arm, Were it upraised against thy godlike breast! Xarifa's benefactor! mine! and his, My more than father! his, who rear'd my youth From orphan'd infancy! JUAN (starting). An orphan! (Aside, mastering his emotion). Sure 'Tis weak compassion moves me thus—no more. (Resuming tranquillity). Depart, brave veteran. Lovely maid, farewell! (To the attendants). Give them safe convoy to the city's walls. [Moraizel, Hamad, Xarifa, and train move offin procession. Juan follows Hamad with his eyes. Why of his fortunes did I not inquire? Oh! thou tormentor, Hope! must I still listen To thy suggestions, idle, vain, delusive? [Exeunt Spaniards on the other side, Juan thoughtful. Scene closes. SCENE II. Royal Apartments in the Alhambra. The King with Galefo, and proper attendants. KING (thoughtful and disturbed). Fool that I was to grant her suit! and yet 'Twere shame to knighthood and to public faith Should he detain the maid. The haughty Juan Was ever noble. (To an attendant). Hast thou o'erlook'd the plain? Saw'st thou the youth and lovely maid returning? Leads she her rescued father? ATTENDANT. No, my liege, I nothing saw when last— KING. Peace, fool!—Galefo, Haste to the eastern turret. Yon dull clod Nor sees nor hears aright. Thy eye is keen, Glance o'er the plain;—return with lightning's speed. [Galefo goes. The King is again thoughtful. 'Twere idle to suppose the Spanish chief Would such a prize release.—No—no! and he, Moraizel, may assert a father's right. Yet a fond father would not doom his child To sad captivity. She will return— I yet shall see her. Galefo enters. Ha! thou smil'st, Galefo! GALEFO. They come, my liege, they come! within the walls, E'en now, the joyous troop approach th' Alhambra: They lead Moraizel. KING. Thanks, Galefo, thanks. Thou see'st my joy to greet the rescued chief. (Aside). She comes! victorious fair! My spirits all Rush with tumultuous throbbings to my breast, That scarce I can find utterance.—'Tis she! Enter Moraizel, Xarifa, Moorish damsels, &amp;c. in a festive and triumphant train. Moraizel kneels to the King. MORAIZEL. Lo! at your feet, my sov'reign lord, behold Your faithful subject! from the Spaniard's bonds By filial tenderness redeem'd. KING. Most welcome! Rise, valiant chief! thy monarch holds thee dear For thy own worth, and for thy peerless daughter's. (Turning to Xarifa). Say, how may we, fair excellence, repay Our own particular debt, to hold again The honour'd veteran we lamented lost? XARIFA. I am too well repaid, my gracious liege; No thanks are mine—'twas Hamad's prayer prevail'd. MORAIZEL. 'Tis thine, my child, by duteous tenderness, Still to repay tenfold the generous deed. Long promised to the noble youth, my liege, I had appointed to bestow, to-morrow, My daughter on his faith. KING (much agitated). Bestow thy daughter? Said'st thou long promised? She—the fair Xarifa? I knew not this.—Moraizel, thou art secret! MORAIZEL. The humble fate of old Moraizel's child, Methinks, were not of moment to arrest The royal thought. KING. The fate of one so fair, And of a race so noble, well might claim A monarch's watchful care—nor can we sanction That thou unworthily should'st match the maid. MORAIZEL (with respectful firmness). My word is given. Hamad well deserves her. KING. Hamad deserve her?—Ha! what mighty deed Has yet graced Hamad's arms? A thousand swords Of proof, by Hamad's single valour wrested From thousand Spaniards' grasp, would warrant ill So high an aim! MORAIZEL (more firmly). My liege, she is my daughter. KING. She is my subject! and thou shalt not doom To low obscurity, to household cares, A maid whose charms might fire a monarch's breast. MORAIZEL. Ha! “shall not!” Heard I well? KING. Dost thou reply? Let Hamad first by deeds of arms deserve Abdallah's favour, and Xarifa's hand! Meantime this jewel of Granada's crown Within the Alhambra palace shall be lodged. Start not, old man. Thy daughter shall be honour'd, Thou hast my royal word. MORAIZEL (bows with suppressed indignation, and then aside with agitation). He durst not—no— I will be calm.— [Xarifa presses close to him. My child! XARIFA (with inquiring looks). Speak—speak, my father! MORAIZEL. Xarifa! Oh! I cannot speak my thoughts! XARIFA. I read them all in this parental tear. This trembling grasp that holds me to thy bosom, Each speaks a several blessing! MORAIZEL. That my blessings Might as a guardian host— KING (interrupting them). Sweet excellence! Retire, I pray, where there thy slaves will tend thee. Let every knee bend to the fair Xarifa. Read in her eyes her will, and all obey! XARIFA (terrified, and clinging to her father). Oh! leave me not, my father! KING. Stay, Moraizel! (To Xarifa). Fear nothing thou.— (To Moraizel). Nay, I command thee stay. [Xarifa is led out. Why dost thou frown, and mark with grudging eye The honours on thy daughter's worth conferr'd? MORAIZEL. My liege, I have been silent, for I fear'd To wake in her pure thought the least suspicion Of what her father dreads. KING (with levity). And does thou dread A king should think her fair? MORAIZEL. I do, my liege. KING. Know then we love her! that we have resolved To snatch her from the fate, the abject fate, To which her father dooms her matchless charms. Nay, smooth thy brow—she must, she shall be mine. Why thus disturb'd, Moraizel? Moorish maids Account it fame to win a monarch's love! What should'st thou fear? MORAIZEL. True, what should I fear? Thou canst but ease me of my weight of years. Behold this faithful bosom! here strike home! For till thy hand has still'd life's last pulsation, Thou shalt not, king, dishonour old Moraizel! And have I shed for thee in glory's field More blood than frolics in thy wanton veins, To be rewarded thus? KING. Old man, take heed. As yet thy daughter's graces stand between Thee and Abdallah's wrath! MORAIZEL (clasping his hands with passionate tenderness). My bosom's pride! My virtuous child! Rear'd in such innocence That she pass'd on, nor read the fell intent Thy eye's wild flash proclaim'd! KING. Peace, dotard, peace! MORAIZEL. Hast thou forgot the race of which she springs? The Aben-Zurrahs will avenge her wrongs. KING (starts, and appears disturbed). The Aben-Zurrahs! Ha! too oft they have shook Granada's throne; and now, its best support!— At such a time as this!—It must not be. Where was my better judgment? This sweet frenzy Possess'd my soul with such resistless sway, I lost all thought but to obtain the maid. [After a pause of thought, while Moraizel appears wrapt in grief. My queen! my wife!—Yes, she would grace a throne. (To Moraizel). I will forget thy warmth. Thou didst mistake Our purpose, good Moraizel. Is a diadem So poor a gift? MORAIZEL. I understand you not. KING. The lovely maid shall be Abdallah's queen. MORAIZEL. May I believe your words, my gracious liege? Have I so much misjudged my sov'reign's thought? KING. Anger will hoodwink judgment! Yes, my friend, Xarifa's noble birth, and spotless fame, As to thyself are to Abdallah sacred. MORAIZEL. Yet still, my liege, I crave a patient hearing. Young Hamad has my word. By my consent, Their interchange of vows, and mutual faith. KING. I will deal nobly with him. Summon him. [Exit Moraizel. The youth is of high mettle. I will touch him That he shall sue for danger as a boon. Nor shall he vainly sue! I will confer it As most especial favour. Re-enter Moraizel with Hamad. Gallant Hamad! Brave youth, approach! Think not I doubt thy worth, Yet are Xarifa's charms of higher price Than good Moraizel deems. It were not well That she, so excellent, so fair, so virtuous, Were thine, ere thou hast proved in fight that valour We all believe thou own'st. It were not well That slander on Moraizel's choice should glance, And say his age misplaced the precious gem Would grace a monarch's crown. HAMAD. My gracious liege! Your words are just! Oh put me to the proof! Yet let me sue—by love's impatience sue— That I, not later than to-morrow, vindicate My valour on the foe. In this dear cause, All tasks were light save such as ask delay. KING. One sun for thee shall, in its circling course, Include a life of glory. The proud task Not without danger, that shall stamp thy fame; But glory, well thou know'st, on danger waits. The blood that mantles in thy cheek assents, While on thy brow sits crested honour throned! Yes, thou wilt justify Moraizel's choice! HAMAD. Or leave my life upon the bloody plain! KING. Know, with ourself in equal poize we hold thee, In Fortune's adverse scales. We are thy rival! We love Xarifa! on Granada's throne, Would place her matchless virtues. HAMAD (aside, thunder struck). Help me, Heaven! KING. Our will were absolute! yet as man to man, Thy king says—“Win her, Hamad, she is thine.” So wilt thou doubtless. Yet we rule not, youth, The shifting fates, and if thou win her not, As frankly yield her thou! HAMAD. What say'st thou? Yield her? Yield my Xarifa?—Never but with life! Abdallah, no! Thou bad'st me win the maid. Methinks a thousand scorpions nestle here Till I go forth. See there be danger, king, To shame proud knighthood's blazon'd feats till now, Or the light task might but disgrace the prize. KING. Thy speech is big: no doubt thy deeds will match it. Thy kinsman band of valiant Aben-Zurrahs Beneath the sacred standard thou shalt lead. Thou know'st the law! Beneath that holy ensign, To turn aside before the world in arms, Incurs dishonour! and to lose it—death! HAMAD. Thanks, thanks, my gracious liege! A band of knights, Though unmatch'd, few, against the Spanish host Flush'd by late victory! the enterprise Is worthy of the blood we boast. To-morrow Victorious Hamad claims Xarifa's hand! KING. Go, noble youth! summon th' intrepid band— Go forth ere dawn—the word be “Love and Glory.”— So the young eagle springs into the sky To meet the eye of day, with lusty wing Winnowing the chequer'd clouds, then, poised a space Firm in mid air, stoops on the careless quarry Ere from his plumes he shake the dews of night. [Moraizel and Hamad speak apart. Moraizel appearing to encourage, and dismiss him kindly. How easy 'tis to urge fond, headlong, youth To self destruction! As a noxious reptile, That chanced to cross my path, I might have crush'd him, Or whisper'd some dark Zegri in the ear, “Hamad obstructs my way!” But were it wise To buy Xarifa's hate? or live to feel Th' accomplice Zegri tyrant of his lord? More skilful—nay, more honest, sure, to say, “Thou art my bane—kind youth, remove thyself.” [Having dismissed Hamad, Moraizel rejoins the King. Moraizel, art thou satisfied? MORAIZEL. My liege, The task, methinks, o'ermatches Hamad's youth. KING. Brave Hamad thinks not so.—Art thou content, If Hamad win her not, thy peerless daughter Grace King Abdallah's throne? MORAIZEL. To glory dead, Of abject soul, I were, if such high honours I could unmoved contemplate. Yet, my liege, The youth has claims upon my love:—to-day He would have worn my bonds. KING (impatient). No more! no more!— The Prophet will decide our claims, old man. Go thou and calm thy daughter's fears. Ere long, Abdallah at her feet will tell his love. [Exit. MORAIZEL (alone). My daughter on Granada's throne! The Zegris, Their proud crests fall'n! 'Twere glorious!—But her tears! The gallant Hamad's worth! My honour pledged!— Though pure, and gentle, is she not a woman? Splendour, and power, and greatness in the queen Will dry the maiden's tears, as mid-day suns Disperse the dews of morning.—“Hamad's worth!” Xarifa shall reward it from the throne.— “My honour pledged!” I nought infringe my word: 'Tis the king rules, not I.—I needs must yield. Abdallah nobly said, “Let Hamad win her!” And wisely, “The Prophet will decide our claims.” Shall I pluck from my daughter's brow the diadem, If Mahomet decree to place it there? [Exit. ACT III. SCENE I. The Plain before the Walls of the City. Spaniards in great numbers are driven back by the Aben-Zurrah knights. After the skirmish, two straggling Spaniards meet on the stage. FIRST SPANIARD. What is our veteran band o'erthrown alike? This is most strange and fearful! SECOND SPANIARD. Dost thou wonder? Roused from their slumbers ere the dawn of day! Sore from late hard-earn'd victory, our soldiers Marshall'd in haste, scarce arm'd— FIRST SPANIARD. Good Heaven befriend us! A band of madmen sure this Moorish troop. I never saw such desperation rage. Didst mark their headlong leader?—One would say He, in youth's proud conceit, had ta'en the burthen Of the long war that wastes alike both states On his gay shoulders—confident to end The strife at once!—But mark!—with eagle flight He stoops this way.—I'll not encounter him. [Exeunt. [Routed Spaniards again cross the stage. Hamad remains with the Moorish knights and the sacred standard. HAMAD. Is the day ours, completely ours, my friends? And am I blest beyond all mortal thought? FIRST MOORISH KNIGHT. We have not met Don Juan in the field; The sun is not yet high; although dispersed, The foe may rally. Juan not o'ercome, I cannot hold the victory ours. [To Hamad. Hast thou Encounter'd him? HAMAD. Not I! the Gods be praised! SECOND MOORISH KNIGHT. Were it not Hamad's voice, those tones, methinks, Might argue fear. HAMAD. Ha! fear?—Hadst thou not wrought Such wonders for my sake— SECOND MOORISH KNIGHT. Nay, thou wast moved. HAMAD (recollecting himself). I was, good kinsman; and if that be fear, It was with fear—to do a deed of baseness Would darken this bright day. SECOND MOORISH KNIGHT (aside to the first). What mean his words? And mark his alter'd brow! THIRD MOORISH KNIGHT. Look yonder, friends! A troop in gallant cheer advancing! FIRST MOORISH KNIGHT. They come! The flower of Spain!—Don Juan at their head! Now, Hamad, will the day indeed be ours! SECOND MOORISH KNIGHT. In firm array the sacred standard circle! Nay, Albin Hamad, 'tis no time for thought. HAMAD (with effort). True, true, brave knights, my kinsmen, and my fellows! Victory or death!—since it must needs be so! SECOND MOORISH KNIGHT. Sure his voice dies away!—Is he o'erspent? FIRST MOORISH KNIGHT. It were no wonder:—he, like us, is human, And has done more than squares with human powers. See, they approach. HAMAD (with great effort). Charge—charge! “for love and glory!” Enter Juan and his troop. JUAN. Stand, Moor! who as the ravening wolf hast leapt The fold, concealed by thievish night! HAMAD. Don Juan! JUAN (astonished). Husband of Xarifa! HAMAD (with desperation). Nay, come on—come on! JUAN. Why dost thou seek thy fate? HAMAD. I am victorious! A victor, or a corse, must I return! JUAN. Neither—neither, youth. (To his soldiers). My friends, forbear, And stand apart. [Soldiers retire. HAMAD (aside). Delay not!—lest I think— JUAN. Hamad, Don Juan would not take thy life. HAMAD (with passion). Would thou hadst ta'en it when I knelt before thee! Then had my soul escaped Hell's foulest stain, Ingratitude!—for now in mortal fight 'Tis mine to meet thee:—thee!—my benefactor! Yes, noble Juan!—lift the godlike hand That raised me from the earth!—Defend thyself! JUAN. Nay, turn aside. HAMAD. That would incur dishonour! No—I must on!—Xarifa's hand the prize! JUAN. Vain were the thought again beneath yon standard To seek your homes—Spain claims it of our swords! The price were great were Hamad's life the forfeit. HAMAD. Yet, noble Juan, while life's current warms This guilty breast, thou shalt not grasp yon standard. [Lifting his sword, then dropping his arm, and turning away. Oh! every way undone! If by my sabre My benefactor fall, I live the victim Of dark remorse! a terror to myself! But fame, and fair Xarifa, both are mine! Nor shall Abdallah tear her from my arms. (With renewed desperation). Come on! for in this thought a demon rages Would raise my hand against a brother's breast. JUAN. Ha! would Abdallah tear your loves asunder? Live, Hamad, live! to rescue thy Xarifa From splendid wretchedness!—Avoid my sword! HAMAD. Let me fall rather by thy generous hand, And scape such guilt! such ills! in glorious death. Come on, nor fear to strike. JUAN. I will not, Hamad. This is thy first assay!—Methinks it were As one should heave the pond'rous axe to crop The flowers of spring, were I to lift my sword (Temper'd by a long course of hardihood) Against thy youth's fair promise. HAMAD. Haughty Spaniard! Disdains thy pride to meet my youth in fight, And shall I live thus shamed?—Insulted honour! Stifle all weak regards, and nerve this arm, This arm he scorns, to reach his vaunting soul! Thou, who to Xarifa gav'st her father— Whose galling pity (it should seem) refused To bind these limbs, their every swelling sinew Is braced to thy destruction! JUAN. Think what thou dost! Think of Xarifa! HAMAD. Yes!—'tis she I lose, And am dishonour'd!—by thyself despised If I but think of what I do!—Come on! This to thy heart! [They fight—Hamad with wild desperation, Juan on the defensive, with skill and caution. Thou mock'st me still, proud Spaniard! Thou ward'st off my point!—Nay, take my life, Or yield the day. JUAN. Don Juan never yielded: That is thy part. HAMAD. And lose Xarifa!—Hell! [They fight again; Juan disarms Hamad. In the mean time the Moors are overpowered, and the standard taken. JUAN. Thanks! thanks! kind Heaven! (He raises Hamad). Hamad, take thy sword, And deem it not disgrace, that one grown grey Beneath war's iron harness—valiant youth! Though not more brave than thou, should prove more practised In the cool swordsman's skill. HAMAD. Too noble foe! Ah! guilty thus!—thus lost to happiness! The life thou didst disdain to take—this hand— (Attempts to fall on his sword). JUAN. Hold, frantic boy!—Ye noble Moors, his friends, Watch o'er him, save him from his rash despair. (To Hamad). Recall thy better thoughts. Be free—return— Xarifa's husband—rescue her thou lov'st! [To the Moors, gazing on Hamad with admiration as he goes off. He is a gem in knighthood's coronal! To King Abdallah say, if many such His walls pour forth, our sturdiest knights must gird Their blades of proof to the encounter. Yes, This Moor would honour the best blood of Spain! His foe thus speaks his worth! Sirs, lead him hence. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Xarifa's Apartments in the Alhambra. Abdalla, Xarifa avoiding him. KING. Why dost thou fly me? stay, beloved Xarifa! Have greatness, honours, power, no charm for thee? XARIFA. My thoughts are humble, and in lowliness Content to dwell with him my father chose. Hamad, my liege, will prove invincible! He fights for his Xarifa! KING (fixing her with significant looks). Should he fail? XARIFA. 'Twas confidence in Heaven's mercy led me To seek my father at the victor's feet! 'Twere impious then to doubt that Heaven's mercy Protects my innocence, and Hamad's virtues. E'en now my husband—my victorious husband, Is haply at the gates! [Going, he interrupts her. KING. Patience, sweet maid: Ere long we shall have tidings. (Aside). Her resistance Provokes the fire that rages in my bosom. My senses palled by slaves who woo my smiles, What keen delight to tame this graceful pride! To banish from that radiant brow those frowns! XARIFA. Hark! hark! what sounds are those?—My trembling heart, Is this thy confidence? One comes, and bears My fate. (Enter a Messenger breathless with haste, introduced by Esperanza. MESSENGER. My liege, the noblest victory! KING (betraying his disappointment). Ha! victory? XARIFA (exultingly). Yes, victory! Victory to Hamad! MESSENGER. The noblest victory that human valour Ere yet achieved! but in a moment snatch'd From Hamad's brow! The sacred standard taken— KING (eagerly). And Hamad slain? MESSENGER. Don Juan's self, my liege, After fierce conflict, man to man, disarm'd him. KING. Lives Hamad then? MESSENGER. He does:—but were he not By friends surrounded, who restrain his hand, A thousand times he had the dagger plunged Deep in his desperate heart. KING. Enough!—retire. (Aside). 'Tis well—'tis well—the sacred standard lost. Xarifa faints. Look to the lovely maid!—The female train, Where linger they? [Her attendants rush in. Support her head—she sinks— Soft—lead her in!—Nay, give her to my arms! He supports and contemplates her. She on my bosom rests!—Reclining thus, Thus unresisting clasp'd, unconsciousness A moment wears the semblance of consent. Her fluttering heart beats faster—half unclosed Her eyelids seek the light. That heavy sigh! 'Twas Heaven's own breath!—but was it not for Hamad? XARIFA (reviving). Hamad!—my husband! KING. Thou art with one who loves thee! Loves thee with ardour such as subjects know not. Who at thy feet would lay an empire's crown! Beauties from every clime—thy rivals once— Low bending in thy train! XARIFA (struggling, and getting from him to ESPERANZA). The king!—Oh horror! Save me!—save me! KING. Save thee from whom?—Abdallah Were thy best friend, would'st thou but have him so. XARIFA. Thou! thou my friend! who sent my Hamad forth? KING. Nay, Hamad sued for danger as a boon, Mock'd the slight task that asked but human powers. Th' aspiring youth has highest aims!—would snatch With one bold grasp all Fame can give!—His meed, All that the prophet promises of bliss To long-tried warrior saints!—Am I to blame That Hamad was presumptuous? XARIFA. Thankless king! Thou should'st have slaves, that to the dust abased Shrink from thy banners while they kiss thy feet— Not noble knights thy subjects!—loyal, true, Of matchless valour! KING. Ha! Moraizel's daughter! Fair as thou art, presume not thou too far! It had been deem'd forbearance in a king To let one live, so long, who barr'd the way To what his soul desired; but I, more generous, Bade Hamad win thee by fair deeds of arms. 'Tis this same “matchless valour,” as thou call'st it, More justly term'd presumption!—arrogance! Blots from the roll of chivalry his name! Forfeits his monarch's favour—and thy love! XARIFA. Oh never, never, king! In lowest fortunes Dear to this heart as though the proudest throne Of all the world were his!—Nay, dearer far! For now 'tis mine alone to make him blest. Then let us go for ever from thy sight In poverty—disgrace—with all thy hate! So we but go together, pathless wilds Shall nothing lack of home! of home's best joys! The breath of Fame is worthless to the brave If it but wait on Fortune!—Scornful king! I will so honour him, he shall not miss Or thine! or the applause of multitudes! Love has a thousand shifts thou little think'st To steal away each care! KING. Dost thou insult me With bold avowal of thy shameless passion? Know Hamad's life is forfeit to the law, The sacred standard taken!—Dost thou tremble? [She sinks at his feet. Ha! haughty fair one! dost thou sink abash'd? Who shall resist the law? XARIFA. Thou, king!—thyself! 'Tis thine to pardon!—Heaven's own privilege! KING. Not even kings may, on each slight pretence, Sport with the laws. XARIFA. Is there no hope of mercy? KING. Hamad must die! XARIFA (rising). Say too Xarifa—tyrant! KING. No, thou must live!—live honour'd, fear'd, and loved! XARIFA. And hast thou power to bid the wretched live? Canst thou allay the pang that gnaws the heart? Or blot out memory's strong and faithful transcript? Herbs, by the peasant's thrifty hand distill'd, Can slack the fever's rage—but not thy frown Arrest one pulse-throb hurrying life away. Despair will mock thee from her hollow eye, And with her last sad feeble laugh, elude thee In Death's kind arms!—The godlike power thou hast Thou wilt not use,—and that thou would'st assume, Heaven gives not even to kings! KING (with passion). But thou, fair maid! Thou hast each power thou nam'st.—Oh yes! 'tis thine To rescue from the law its victim!—thine To bid the wretched live!—to still each pang! Arrest the fever warring here with life! And teach Despair to lose herself in joy! XARIFA (shuddering). How may this be? What mean thy eager looks? KING. Adored Xarifa! Yes, brave Hamad's chains Fall at thy bidding!—Pardon, royal favour Await him at thy word! Say—shall he live? XARIFA. I tremble while I say—he shall!—for there— There—in thy eyes—I read—I know not what Of cruel triumph—of strange—horrible joy! Yet—will I say—he shall!—if with me rest The power to save:—for can ingenious malice Inflict, or dream the torments and the racks I would not welcome, and esteem delights?— KING. Talk not of racks and torments. Force shall never Oppose in aught thy will!—save Love's soft force, That would constrain thy sweetness to be blest, In blessing him who cannot live without thee! Away with idle tales of constancy To vows extorted from simplicity, Unknowing of its worth! [Seizing her hand. XARIFA. Loose me, Abdallah! 'Twas Death I welcomed, though beneath the rack, Not life—with thee to live!—and bought by perfidy To Hamad! Nay, by perfidy alike To thee thyself!—were I to vow thee love, And hate thee while I swore! KING. Hate!—said'st thou hate? Beware, ungrateful woman! lest thou rouse The hand of power—of sov'reign power—to vengeance! Yes, there are deaths more frightful than thou dreamest! They wait upon my nod!—To which of these Think'st thou that nod shall doom thy minion—Hamad? XARIFA (frantic with terror). His life!—his life!—'tis all I ask—Be mine Death in each frightful form— KING. Thou hold'st his fate! For him on thy next word hang lingering tortures, Multiplied, various, keeping death at bay! One moment yet is given thee to relent. Say, wilt thou be my wife? XARIFA (after a pause of agony). Impossible! KING. Xarifa has doom'd Hamad's death!—Ho! guards, To instant execution— [Guards enter. XARIFA (clinging to him). Tyrant—hold! Or let me die with him. KING. No, thou shouldst live, If 'twere but to revenge me of thy slights. [She embraces his knees in speechless agony. He contemplates her in her abject posture with savage joy, then relenting, Yet such my weakness still—I blush to own it— I, for thy beauty's sake, could pardon him, So thou would'st be more kind! XARIFA. Oh let him live! Let Hamad live!—Heaven will dispose the rest. KING. Thou know'st the terms! XARIFA. Let Hamad live!—Xarifa Will be—will be— (Aside, turning from him. Oh yes! will soon be—nothing! KING. Will be Abdallah's wife! Granada's queen! XARIFA (aside). Death cannot tarry long! within my bosom I feel his icy grasp. KING. Turn, fair Xarifa! Turn thy averted eyes, that I may gaze, And take in draughts of bliss too heavenly sweet For the weak sense!—Thy willing hand in pledge! XARIFA (trembling and faltering, gives her hand). Swear—swear Hamad shall live! KING. He shall!—he shall! The vow that makes thee mine once seal'd, I swear, Hamad is free!—thyself with royal favour Shalt grace his worth! Then clear thy brow! let smiles Play round those lips again, as sportive beams Dance on the dimpling ripple of the shore, That all my soul may yield to thy soft sway, And snatch a foretaste of the prophet's heaven! [To the guards. Let every minaret throughout Granada, By the muezzin's voice, proclaim my bliss! Prepare the nuptial rites! adorn the mosque! [Taking her hand and leading her off in a state of insensibility. Come on, my fair! my love! my wife! my queen! ACT IV. SCENE I. The Mosque, magnificently illuminated. A splendid marriage procession. Xarifa, supported by Moorish ladies, seems scarcely able to advance. When the procession has entered the Mosque, Alhamut and Ali remain. ALHAMUT. I will not to the Mosque; nor wilt thou, Ali, If on thy brow I read thy thought aright. ALI. No, truly; why should we be there, to cringe Before the Aben-zurrah's haughty daughter, Who from the giddy throne prepares to frown Annihilation on the Zegri race? ALHAMUT. With what deep art Moraizel long conceal'd The serpent in his bosom hatch'd to sting us! ALI. Yes, feigning still his daughter was betrothed To Albin Hamad. But when time is ripe, The youth is sent where sure destruction waits; And now, condemn'd to death, the trusting fool— ALHAMUT. No, Ali, no! the Aben-zurrah's daughter, Ere yet the crown was on her brow, had tasted The sweets of sovereignty. O'erturn'd at will Granada's laws! extended royal pardon, Condemn'd—protected—with the practised grace Of long accustom'd sway. ALI. What mean thy words? ALHAMUT. The royal nuptials solemnized, I bear The mandate for young Hamad's liberation. And see this scroll! these magic words have power To topple from her height this meteor queen. ALI (reads). “If thou would'st rescue her thou lov'st, repair With speed of thought to the Alhambra gardens. A Mute will loiter near the orange grove, And point the secret way.”—How may this work? ALHAMUT. This by a faithful hand to Hamad given!— He loves!—is bold—nor will suspect the snare. My office gives me access to the gardens— Dost thou not guess the rest? Love's twilight hour! The gardens sacred to the queen! ALI. Enough. Mad jealousy, in fierce Abdallah's breast, Will colour high the picture to our wish. ALHAMUT. Come on, my friend! ALI. I will not quit thy side, But share each danger that may free the Zegris From the detested Aben-zurrah's sway. [They go. SCENE II. Hamad chained in a dungeon. HAMAD. How short were years of ill, sure, palpable, To hours of this suspense!—Oh! my Xarifa! Did I say mine?—Mine never, never more Till hideous Death unite us!—Death, whose hand Must dash the roses from that cheek! deface What all fond nature's care but once could form Of fair! of lovely!—steal the melting lustre From those dear eyes!—for ever seal those lips, Cold, pale, and motionless!—Hold! ruthless power! And is it thus thou wilt present my bride— Enter Esperanza. ESPERANZA. My lord! HAMAD. Kind Esperanza!—Speak—Oh speak! And yet I dread to hear!—Is my Xarifa— ESPERANZA. From her I come. She bids thee be of comfort. She bids thee live!—live if thou hold'st her dear, Yet fly Granada's walls. HAMAD (pointing to his chains). Can I obey? ESPERANZA. Hamad, thou can'st. Ev'n now thy chains will fall, And, free as nature made thee, thou may'st range The wide world o'er in liberty and peace. HAMAD. Is Hamad fetter'd by no chains but these? What hand shall loose the bonds of strong affection In childhood woven—closer knit by time? What giant arm shall from this bosom heave The load dishonour heaps?—Impel the spirit With renovated spring to range the world? To me—the desert world—Xarifa lost! Disgraced—condemn'd—I cannot—will not fly! ESPERANZA. Not so. Restored to fame, to royal favour, E'en now the officers of state attend To loose thy chains.—They must not find me here. HAMAD. A moment stay, thou niggard of thy speech! Oh, when the finest chord of all that make The bosom's harmony is snapt asunder, The touch of joy but wakes harsh dissonance. Then with one word attune my soul, and say— Say—she still loves! ESPERANZA. Too well she proves her love! No farther ask—But live!—She thus commands— And fly!—Oh fly! [Exit. HAMAD. Restored to fame and honour! Xarifa true!—Yet that I fly enjoin'd! Enter Alhamut and Officers of State, &amp;c. They loose Hamad's chains, and Alhamut presents him his sword. ALHAMUT. 'Tis King Abdallah's will that Albin Hamad, The flower of Moorish knights, receive his sword, And live, renown'd for deeds of martial prowess, Which forced applause from the astonish'd foe. HAMAD. Oh, let me at my monarch's feet— (Aside, checking himself). But no— He loved her—Gods! what dreadful thought has flash'd Athwart my madd'ning brain?—Away—away, Dastard suspicion! No—he spoke me fair. (To Alhamut, &amp;c.) Thanks, my good friends, thanks for your courtesy: I pray you leave me. [They go. Peace, tumultuous thoughts! [A Mute lingers behind, and puts the scroll into Hamad's hand—he reads it eagerly. She bids me rescue her!—Now all is clear— Thy words of mystery, good Esperanza, Were love's own language!—Yes, she bids me live, And live for her!—She bids me fly these walls, But with her fly! with her in native freedom Range the wide world in liberty and peace! [Exit. SCENE III. The Alhambra Gardens. Xarifa in bridal robes, surrounded by a train of Moorish ladies. She is seated, and appears insensible to every thing around her. FIRST LADY. The queen revives! the flower-perfumed airs, And rich delights th' Alhambra gardens yield, Are grateful to her senses.—Royal mistress, Accept our homage! [They crowd around to do her homage; she turns away, shuddering. SECOND LADY. How may we best obey our sovereign lord In duteous service to Granada's queen? [They present offerings; she looks wild and distressed, and waves them off. FIRST LADY. Will not your majesty regard your slaves? SECOND LADY. The queen rejects our services, methinks. [Esperanza enters at the back of the stage, and comes forward fearfully. ESPERANZA. My queen!—my mistress!—speak. [As she draws near more tenderly. My friend!—Xarifa! [Xarifa starts on hearing her name pronounced tenderly, recognizes Esperanza, and falls on her neck in a flood of tears. FIRST LADY. Shall none but she, the Spanish slave, find favour? SECOND LADY. We yet may be revenged of these proud slights. ESPERANZA. Ladies, I pray withdraw awhile. The queen Will meet ere long with smiles your gentle cares. [They withdraw. We are alone! 'Tis Esperanza! XARIFA. Lives he? ESPERANZA. He does. XARIFA. And free? ESPERANZA. Released from chains, Blest in his monarch's favour— XARIFA (starting and shuddering). Blest!—Ha!—blest!— ESPERANZA. Would'st thou not have him so? XARIFA. It was for that I gladly would have died!—and have done more. Have done what makes grim Death look lovely fair, That I would fondly woo his cold embrace, Change for his pure white shroud these bridal robes, And lay me in his earthy bed for ever! Oh yes! I would have Hamad blest!—and yet 'Tis hard to think him happy—and I—thus! Hadst thou but said content!—Oh no, 'twere poor By so much woe to purchase but content To him I love!— [Starting with horror. Ha! “love!”—It is a crime To speak that word!—A faithless wife already! ESPERANZA. Remember that he lives!—that Hamad lives! Forget all else— XARIFA. “Forget!”—Thou hast not loved! Or if thou hast, he whom thy heart had chosen Forsook thee— ESPERANZA. No—he died. XARIFA (taking her hand with kind compunction). Poor Esperanza! Yet not like me, undone; for thou art free To weep his loss!—Alas! thou art most happy! I must not even think of Hamad's worth— Must nothing feel of all that seem'd life's functions,— And yet must live!—The viewless air, if tainted, The worthless reptile with its puny sting, Can still this motion we call life!—and can Nor madden'd brain, nor broken heart arrest These stubborn beatings forcing on existence? [She feels her heart and her temples, as if distracted. HAMAD (behind the scenes). Xarifa!—My Xarifa! ESPERANZA. Hark! methought Among yon clustering shrubs a voice—It breathed Your name!—All gracious Heaven! who have we here? HAMAD (rushing in). My love! my wife!—Oh, this repays all, all, To see thee once again, and clasp thee thus! [She sinks into his arms in speechless transport. XARIFA. My Hamad! Can it be?—Art thou restored? Safe, and unharm'd? Thy looks speak nought but joy! [After gazing at him, she takes Esperanza aside, and looking wildly and anxiously in her face. Was't all a frightful dream?—Assure my senses. [Esperanza smiles mournfully, and she looks around and recollects hereself. Oh! no, no, no!—These fatal scenes!—too true!— Irrevocably true!— [Returning to Hamad with terror. How camest thou here? Oh fly! for ever fly!—'Tis well with me If thou but fly, for now I know thou liv'st, The power that pent my parting spirit in For this dear hour—this last—last—sad farewell, Will gently loose my bonds, that my wing'd soul May seek the skies, and this forgotten form Mingle with dust!— HAMAD. Forgotten!—thou—forgotten— Mingled with dust!—Thy words, thy looks affright me. XARIFA. Already dead to thee. HAMAD. Ha! faithless! perjured! Dazzled by splendor, has ambition tainted Thy once pure bosom?—No—it cannot be— Thou still art mine!—Come, let us fly, my love! XARIFA. Hold, Hamad, hold!—I never can be thine! HAMAD. Proud, cold Xarifa! does thy heart throw off One Fortune has disown'd?—I fondly hoped That King Abdallah's generous acquittal— XARIFA. Generous! say'st thou?—Hamad, know'st thou not The cruel price? Behold these fatal robes! These trappings of despair! and guess the rest. HAMAD. I will not tremble—No, I know thy truth! I gave not back thy faith—thy father will not, Cannot resume his gift—Thou art my wife! XARIFA (as he looks anxiously in her face waiting her answer, after an agony). I am—most miserable!—Leave me—leave me! Thou liv'st!—Ere long all will bewell! HAMAD. I live! And live for thee! or will not live. XARIFA. Hamad! The choice was mine to link thy name with death, Or mine with wretchedness!—Thou see'st me wretched! HAMAD. Not yet—the fatal vow—thou art not yet— XARIFA. I am—another's!—but not long to be so. There's something here assures me 'tis not long. HAMAD. No, not a moment longer!—We will fly! XARIFA. I never learnt to fly from duty's voice, Till now so sweet! and still to be obey'd However stern!—'Tis mine to stay—and die! But fly! thou, once so loved, and still so dear, Fly!—Seek thou happiness in other climes, And tell thy heart thou seek'st it for Xarifa! 'Twill e'en be so!—Thy happiness will make Her only joy, though in the realms of bliss! HAMAD. Cruel! In vain thou calmly bid'st me live. XARIFA. Would Hamad see Xarifa thus undone, And rob her of the meed? HAMAD. Am I a stock? A thing insensible to pain?—We are one! From infancy are one!—Our earliest sports, Our opening minds, our fellowship of thought, Our first affections, sorrows, hopes, and fears, All, all, were one!—Without thee I am nothing— [He weeps. I do not bid thee live!—I better know How much we are one!—Then let me die, Xarifa, Or be thou mine!—spite of the whole world, mine! XARIFA. Thy grief has robb'd thee of thy better self, That thou should'st urge her, so respected once, Unworthily to act. Yet is it well, That thus, awakening slumbering conscience, Thou warn me to preserve us both from crime. The honour of my blood—my father's name— The memory of my virtuous mother—all— Rise in array against mad passion's dictates. I am a wife! and in those holy bonds Unstain'd will die!—I am a queen!—the throne Is as the sun—the cloud that dims his lustre Darkens the world beneath!—Then from the throne Virtue's pure beams shall flow, and Moorish dames In virtue's cause shall learn of me to suffer. HAMAD. Where shall I hide me? worthless as I am! Thus at thy feet, bright matchless excellence— XARIFA. Rise, rise—in pity— Alhamut, Ali, and Janisaries rush in. ALHAMUT. Traitor!—tenfold traitor! Is this thy gratitude to great Abdallah? XARIFA. Oh! hear me—hear me!—He is innocent. Hold, merciless— ALHAMUT. Nay, bind him fast—Come on— Now to the king. [In the struggle Hamad drops the scroll. HAMAD. Farewell! beloved Xarifa! Yes, death is sure!—Nor will the guilt be mine To disobey thy will.—Farewell—for ever! [As they are leading him off, the King with attendants comes hastily from the distant part of the garden. KING. What savage broil profanes the holy stillness Of this blest evening, and these blissful bowers, Held sacred to Granada's queen?—Her train, Where loiter they?—thus negligent? [The female train rush in from all parts, terrified. ALHAMUT. My liege, Your faithful Zegris, to your service vow'd, Seeing these haunts of royal privacy Most foully violated, and your honour Outraged by the Aben-Zurrah— KING. Ha! Hamad! He, whom e'en now mistaken mercy spared? But speak—be brief—tell all the hateful tale. ALHAMUT. Forgive if loyalty unwilling wound. Foul passion's language struck our startled ears! We nearer drew:—Of flight the villain spoke, And caught her in his arms—the yielding fair!— My liege, our zeal no longer knew control: On him we rush'd, and as he fiercely struggled, From his false bosom fell this treach'rous scroll. [The King snatches, and reads it. KING. Accursed traitor!—Thou! abandon'd woman! The law thy doom declares!—In flames to-morrow Thy bosom must yield up its fouler fires! XARIFA (clasping his knees). Oh, hear me, king!—'tis false. KING (putting her away with fury). I will not hear! XARIFA (clinging to him). Dash me to fragments! trample me to dust! I will not—will not loose thee till thou hear me. KING. Away, thou serpent!—wind not round me thus. (To the attendants Prepare the rack! and see the flames be fierce— They cannot match the fury raging here. XARIFA. Abdallah! hear me! hear me—thou! my husband! KING. That tender name! which to my heart erewhile Had been so sweet! as sting of scorpion now Is keen and poisonous. [After an agony he turns to the Zegris enraged. Ye envious Zegris! At peril of your lives, and dearer souls, Prove your tale true!—or I, by Allah, swear My vengeance shall devise more bitter pangs, More various, and more lasting, than even these Your malice has inflicted! ALHAMUT. Is suspicion All the reward of loyalty and faith? Then, in this presence, thus our knighthood's pledge We freely throw! [Throwing down his gauntlet. —and challenge chivalry Throughout the world! of Moslem faith or Christian, To take that gauntlet up! KING. The bold defiance Be through the realm proclaim'd!—To-morrow's sun Shall vindicate my queen from slander's charge, Or smile upon the flames that wrap her shame. The deepest dungeon, and the heaviest chains, Meantime, be Hamad's portion—Thou, Galefo, See this be done.— [To the attendant ladies. And ye, lead hence the queen, Until our farther pleasure we make known. [Exeunt severally. ACT V. SCENE I. Juan alone in his tent.—Night.—Illuminated with lamps—armour lying on the ground. JUAN. Strange that this Moorish maid, and gallant youth, So haunt my fancy!—Yes, her silver tones Struck on my ear as though Daraxa spoke; And when he sunk in fight beneath my arm, I could have snatch'd him to my heart, for then His upward eyes' dark radiance beam'd on me As hers was wont! [He paces the stage thoughtfully. 'Tis rumour'd in the camp, Xarifa is the fierce Abdallah's queen— The youth condemn'd to death. Enter Hamad, wrapt in a cloak. What form is this? HAMAD. It is the form of one undone by thee! And, for the spirit once its happy tenant, By fell Despair inhabited! [Throwing off the cloak. Behold The victim of thy goodness and thy valour! JUAN. Young Hamad!—Yes, 'tis he!—What joy is mine That still thou liv'st! HAMAD (giving him a paper with sullen sadness). These from Granada's queen! JUAN. Ha! from the queen!—Then is it true, poor youth! Sever'd from her thou lov'st— HAMAD. Speak not of me! I have no being, save what ministers This one act of obedience to her will. JUAN (reads). “Granada's slander'd queen in knighthood's name On noble Juan calls, that in the lists His spear maintain her cause against the Zegris. By all condemn'd!—held guilty by her father!— No Moorish knight defends the wrong'd Xarifa. Heaven and brave Hamad know her innocence!” HAMAD (with sudden transport). Oh she is pure as yon chaste orb!—as pure As bending angels who attend to welcome Her brighter spirit to their heavenly choir! Give but a sword, brave Juan, to my grasp! Nay, the bare sinews of this single arm, Methinks, in virtue's cause should crush to dust Base, trembling slander, though in mail of proof! JUAN (who has watched him with admiration). Ye shall stand cleared before the world! Oh thou! Who rul'st the battle! thou!—attest my vow To save the wrong'd Xarifa and brave Hamad! HAMAD. Art thou a god? JUAN. I am a knight, young Moor, And so art thou!—The cause of innocence! Of slander'd chastity!—is knighthood's cause In every clime alike.—Thou shalt have arms— (JUAN considers him). But who art thou, that, strangely moved, my heart Should thus adopt thy fortunes? HAMAD. I am one, From birth a wretch!—and now to death consign'd— To shame, and to oblivion! Noble Juan, Waste not a thought on me. Xarifa's fame Rescued from slander's taint! and Hamad dead— [Taking a string of gems from his bosom, and with great emotion. Oh! give her this—'tis all that e'er was mine— Tell her— JUAN (examining them with agitation). Thine?—thine?—these gems!—Speak, youth—how thine? HAMAD. A mother, with her dying blessing, bound them Around my infant neck, nor till this hour— JUAN (who has torn a similar one from his own bosom, compares them with trembling hands). Are they not, gem for gem, the same?—say thou! These eyes are dazzled— [Brushes off a tear. Haply they deceive me. HAMAD (takes them). I am amazed!—nor know I which was mine. JUAN. 'Twas on the day we pledged our mutual faith! A mutual token each! [Seems choked, then breaking forth. And would she not Thy infant lips should lisp thy father's name? My son! my son! my lost Daraxa's image! [Falling on his neck in an agony. HAMAD. Thou!—thou my father!—thou—our benefactor! Against whose breast this parricidal hand Erewhile was frantic raised! Oh outraged Nature! JUAN. Nay, rather own her strong mysterious power! 'Twas Nature spoke when Juan woo'd thy valour To turn aside in battle!—Imperious Nature! That summon'd to thy cheek Don Juan's blood, Deep-mantling crimson at th' inglorious thought; Nature that pitying warded off thy point, Lest it should pierce a father's breast, and blunted The sword of Juan raised against his son. HAMAD. My noble father!—canst thou thus excuse The impious fury— JUAN. I, like thee, was young— Like thee I loved.—And think'st thou, had I fought For my Daraxa, with less deadly rage This arm had dared?—Thy peerless mother was!— My child! thou hast much of her!—Her brow! her eye! She ruled my soul as only virtue can! Not as dark braided locks, and laughing eyes, In every city claim a soldier's homage. 'Twas a new being!—But I prattle idly Of what has been—'tis past!—and thou, my son! If it be true, to death condemn'd—how here? How from Abdallah's cruelty released? HAMAD. A faithful Spanish slave who tends the queen Besought my jailor in Xarifa's name— I pledged my word to yield myself to-morrow To meet my doom; and thus my jailor won. Wrapt in his cloak I darkling pass'd the guard. Thy outposts I eluded, practised well To thread each tangled brake, each deep ravine. But mark!—methinks already in the east The fatal dawn!—and ere the sun go down The fair Xarifa dies!—dishonour'd dies!— Thou, noble knight! my generous foe! my father! Haste—let us arm to vindicate my queen! Then will I to my dungeon—with glad arms Outstretch'd to meet my chains, and hug them close, Till welcome death— JUAN. Talk'st thou of death, my son? Glory awaits thee, victory, and bliss! Oh! I have much to tell, and much to learn! But now for deeds of arms! “For love and glory!” [They retire into the tent, and the scene closes. SCENE II. Royal Apartments. XARIFA (alone). The hour is near, and Esperanza comes not. By all deserted!—miserable greatness! A few days past, had the base Zegri knights Blacken'd the fame of old Moraizel's daughter, An hundred swords had from their scabbards leapt, An hundred spears gleam'd in the rest !—But now I am a queen!—a wretched queen!—all hearts Have thrown me off to royal loneliness! Methinks that else—the cause of the oppress'd Were knighthood's proper cause! [Takes a dagger concealed in her dress, and gazes on it. Good Esperanza! If thou succeed not, this, thy last kind boon, From public obloquy—My father here! Enter Moraizel. MORAIZEL. Thou of the Aben-Zurrah race the stain! The sun already high!—the lists prepared— No knight takes up the gauntlet by the Zegris In proud defiance thrown:—so foul thy deed! Thy guilt so plain!—At noon, death's iron hand For ever seals thy shame! XARIFA (with dignified composure). Not so, my father! I still have hope—for I am innocent! Shall I forget, so oft when on your knee A happy child!—and Hamad at your feet— To school our opening minds, from all around You drew some theme of trust in Heaven's mercy? If in the terrors of the storm I clung Closer and closer to thy bosom, smiling, Thou bad'st me lift my tearful eyes, and welcome, Within the cloud's dark folds, the gathering flood Salubrious, to fertilize the earth! Admire the fires that flash'd from pole to pole, Winnowing the air, with impure vapours clogg'd, Noxious to life:—and mark, the tempest pass'd, How bright! how fresh! how joyous nature all! Thus train'd by thee, in Heaven's darkest frown, To find a hidden mercy—I will hope! For I am innocent!—to the last will hope To leave a spotless name!—and thou, stern Death, Suspend thy shaft, till some commission'd spear Confound the slanderers!—and I own, once more, No ills, save those thy hand can cure! MORAIZEL. My child! I cannot look on thee and think thee false— Yet, yet—the scroll!—thy train of damsels Timely dismiss'd!—all, all, force strong conviction. Despight of proofs so pregnant, could I hold thee Still chaste, and pure from blame, my trusty blade I'd buckle on, and grasp my toughest lance, Old as I am!—these lusty knights should feel, (Though to their banners rallied hell's dark powers), With Heaven on his side, a father's vengeance! Enter Abdallah. KING. Ere yet thou die, once more within these walls Thou see'st thy injured husband, and thy king! Thank partial nature, lavish to adorn Thy outward form, that the recoiling hand Shudders to mar the mould so wond'rous fair, To strike at the deformity within.— Would thou wert guiltless! XARIFA. If the unshaken purpose To die in strict observance of the vow, The fatal vow I breathed, be innocence, My soul is free of all offence to thee! KING. Free of offence!—Ah! shameless!—at thy feet A slave! a traitor! fired by lawless passion! Had not the faithful Zegris interposed— Ha! dost thou blush? XARIFA. It were thy part to blush, If such thy thoughts of her thou hast compell'd To share thy crown. KING. Would'st thou imply the crime Was his alone?—By Allah, might I think it!— But no—thou lov'st:—with equal guilt thou lov'st. XARIFA. I love—his virtues! KING. Thou lov'st him with the love My due!—and purchased by a throne!—Confess Thou lov'st him—Speak— XARIFA. Else why am I thy wife? KING. Accursed wretch! thou gloriest in thy guilt? XARIFA. I know not guilt. Thy queen is innocent. I loved young Hamad better than myself When I, for him, became Abdallah's wife! But since I am thy wife, know, King Abdallah, I hold my honour dearer even than Hamad— And, for my honour's sake, am innocent! KING. Then is he guilty!—he alone! XARIFA (terrified). Oh, no!— Hamad is guiltless! KING. Thou, and he!—both, both. Why tremblest thou? XARIFA. Not for myself! KING. For him That quivering lip—that crimson tide now rushing O'er thy blanch'd cheek!—Thou own'st it—all for him! So young! so fair!—Is vice so bold? so reckless? XARIFA. No, innocence is bold! and wretchedness Is, indeed, reckless. KING. Would'st thou urge this hand Instant to search thy bosom's depths, and pluck Th' adulterous passion forth, and, with it, life! Hast thou no fear? XARIFA. Oh, spare me—spare me, king! For I have fear—I fear to die dishonour'd! And I have hope—hope in Heaven's justice still! Then stay thy hand. Ere noon, with spotless fame, The wrong'd Xarifa of thy rage may woo The stroke, she for a moment would suspend. KING. Within an hour, irrevocable death Will give thy name to infamy for ever. Already multitudes have throng'd the lists. The knights appellants, gay-careering, urge Their foaming coursers o'er the vacant space, Held by no knight defendant in thy cause. [A trumpet heard. The trumpet sounds! The ministers of justice But wait my signal to conduct thee forth To public execution! XARIFA (with great firmness). I am prepared! If Heaven protect not innocence below, The greater its reward in realms of bliss! And she thou would'st to infamy consign, Closing her eyes in death awakes to glory! [As she is speaking the Officers of Justice enter, and she is led to execution. SCENE III. The Lists. In the farther part of the stage preparations for the execution of the Queen. The Zegri Knights armed cap-à-pie on horseback, with their lances in the rest. After they have paraded the lists, the Queen is led in, covered by a black veil, to slow and solemn music, and conducted to a seat apart from the King, who ascends a throne. Alhamut lifts his vizor, and speaks. ALHAMUT. Mighty Abdallah! see your faithful knights, Who, when the morning dawn'd, already arm'd, Their trusty lances grasp'd; and confident In their good cause, in Allah, and the Prophet, Thrice by the trumpet's voice have vainly call'd On knighthood to defend thy faithless queen— The hour appointed by the law is pass'd! If none embrace her cause, 'tis Heaven's decree, Thy queen is guilty!—Wherefore this delay? KING. Valiant Alhamut!—yes, thy words are just. Allah has blest, my friends, the loyal swords Your faith unsheathed against her double treason. (Rising.) The queen is guilty! Let devouring flames Prey on those charms, by angry Heaven lent To wreck a monarch's peace. Moors enter with torches to light the funeral pyre, and as the Officers of Justice approach Xarifa, Esperanza rushes in, and the Queen falls on her neck. Suddenly a distant trumpet is heard—Esperanza clasps her hands, and exclaims, ESPERANZA. A challenge sounds! 'Tis on the gale!—Forbear, ye bloody men! Again!—Again! XARIFA. Then Heaven has not forgot me! ALHAMUT. My liege, delay not. Justice claims her victim. ESPERANZA. Nearer, and nearer still!—They come! they come! Enter Juan and Hamad on horseback, armed cap-à-pie, their vizors down. They stop before Xarifa, dismount, and kneel before her. JUAN. Low at your feet, behold, much injured queen, Two stranger knights, who to your cause devote Their arms, their lives!—Accept our service, lady, And we will fall within this listed space, Or see thy honour, clear'd from slander's stain, Beam doubly radiant, as the glorious sun Smiles in his might upon the cloud dispersed. XARIFA (rises, and raises them graciously). Brave knights, and friends of the defenceless, rise! The thanks and blessings of a broken heart Were as a faded wreath, unmeet to grace Your noble brows! But deeds of godlike goodness Yield their own meed to souls of godlike mould! Heaven is my witness that my cause is just! And hope, that almost had forsook my breast, In you reposed, becomes strong certainty. Angels, to pure intentions ever friendly, Will hover watchful o'er the kindred spirits Lodged in those gracious forms! [Aside to Esperanza, while the knights remount their horses, and prepare to fight. 'Tis Juan's self! But who is he?—the younger knight who spoke not? Methought he trembled. ESPERANZA (half smiling). He alike is brave! XARIFA. Nay, guess my thought, dear Esperanza, he Whom I dare not name— ESPERANZA (whispers). 'Tis he—'tis Juan's son! XARIFA. His son!—Mysterious Heaven! ESPERANZA. We are observed. [The knights have now taken their positions. JUAN. Base, recreant slaves! true knighthood's lasting shame! Thus in the rest I place my trusty spear In the pure cause of innocence! HAMAD. And I! I have no breath to waste in empty words, Which could not speak your infamy.—Come on! This to thy traitor's heart! [Hamad engages Alhamut, and Juan, Ali. Their spears are broken; they dismount, and fight with their swords. Juan and Hamad conquer. Alhamut falls on the front of the stage. Hamad points his sword at his breast. HAMAD. Villain, ere yet this hand dismiss a spirit Recoiling hell shall shudder to receive, Declare Xarifa's angel purity. ALHAMUT. The voice of Hamad!—Heaven! thy hand is on me— Release my bosom—Oh!—the skies are dark— And Paradise—for ever—closed— HAMAD. Speak, traitor! ALHAMUT. Oh!—sheathe thy sword—already—Hamad— Its cold—cold point— HAMAD. Ere yawning hell engulf thee, The queen!—the queen!— ALHAMUT. The queen is—innocent! [Alhamut sinks into his squire's arms, and is borne to the back of the stage. Shouts of triumph. Juan and Hamad lay the swords of the conquered Zegris at Xarifa's feet. JUAN. Lady, thou art free! a wretched queen no more; The vow, at an unhallow'd shrine extorted, Is void!—betroth'd to Hamad—perjury! And he who casts thee from him, to the flames, Has justly lost thee. KING (rushing from his throne). Lost?—Presumptuous knight! Thy valour claims a monarch's thanks; thou hast them: But we give law within Granada's walls! And thou, our queen once more, to fame restored, We take thee to our bosom, and our throne. [As he approaches to take her hand, she comes forward with disordered steps, avoiding him. XARIFA. Forbear, Abdallah!—Nay, approach me not. HAMAD (with exultation and impassioned expression). Th' award of knighthood is held Heaven's decree! Again thou art mine! my wife betrothed! my love! Thou my lost happiness! my rescued bliss! My life! my all!— XARIFA. Forbear!—forbear! alike. [She motions all to stand apart with increasing agitation. A little space I pray—Oh! farther yet.— (To Hamad tenderly). Thou, most of all!—My bursting heart would thank— Would thank—my brave deliverers!—for fame— Life's better part—restored— [She appears unable to proceed—a pause of suspense and violent emotion on her part. Aside. But not—for life! To live the tyrant's wife!—Or worse—to give To Hamad's love pollution! perjury! Oh, horrible alike!—Death!—Death! alone. (To Hamad with assumed firmness). Th' award of knighthood cannot loose the vow Breathed at the altar! breathed in truth and honour, Howe'er extorted— (To Abdallah with dignity). King! I am thy wife! KING. Pattern of virtue! glory of my throne! [As he approaches with rapture she still wards him off. XARIFA. A moment yet delay! I pray—a moment— (To Hamad). To thee, my Hamad, all I am was vow'd— From childhood vow'd! lord of my first fond thoughts! (Turning to Moraizel). The husband thou, my father, badst me love! And on my head (thou heard'st it) I invoked Heaven's vengeance if in thought or deed I wrong'd him. [She takes a dagger concealed in her breast. Thus!—thus!—I seal, and quit alike each vow! [Stabs herself. KING (rushing to support her). Hold, frantic woman! MORAIZEL. Spare thy wretched father! XARIFA (to ABDALLAH). I die—a virtuous queen—and spotless—wife— Hadst thou—been gentle!—patient—I—had waited— The sure—yet slower hand—of—sorrow.— [She puts him gently from her, and makes an effort to approach Hamad, who rouses himself from stupefaction, and supports her. Hamad!— A few—pangs—yet!—to me they—are not—bitter,— And—I am thine—again!—for ever—thine!— [Hamad attempts to seize the dagger she has dropped. She makes an effort, and catches his arm. Live! live!—to pay—my debt—of gratitude— To him—thy—noble—father!— [She motions Juan to approach, takes his hand, and points to Hamad. Guard him!—save—him— From—his—despair—Oh thou—my brave—preserver. [She sinks again on Hamad's bosom. Kind Death—deals—gently—with me.—'Tis not—hard To sink—in sleep—thus gazing—on thee—Hamad!— It had—been—hard—to live—another's—wife!— And, stain'd—by broken—vows,—I were—unworthy— [Seeing her father, who hangs over her in speechless sorrow. Thy—blessing—on thy dying—child!—My Hamad!— Oh!—I am—very—faint!—that pang!—it cancels— The—fatal—vow!—and now—my love!—my husband! [She dies in Hamad's arms, and the curtain drops. POEMS. STANZAS WRITTEN IN APRIL, 1797, SOME MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF MY SISTER JANE. Now laughing Spring awakens all the vale, On Zephyr's wing a thousand perfumes float, And the first cuckoo's solitary note Bids us expect the evening nightingale: With gaudy flowers the chequer'd fields are drest, The violet lurks in every brake and dell; With joy and hope all Nature seems to swell: But 'tis nor joy, nor hope, that swells within my breast. For not gay Spring that wont to lift my soul, Nor zephyrs breathing on the bounding sense Of untamed youth, in all their redolence, Can now keen memory's secret power control: Nor birds, nor flowers, in tangled brake or dell, That once through all my being bore delight, Can my dull ear and sadden'd eye invite, Or teach my heart again with joy and hope to swell. Fragrant the breezes of the morning sweep, Bearing away the new-turn'd furrow's breath, And scent of grass fresh-nibbled on the heath By eager sheep; while on the crumbling steep Rash lambs, thick huddling, seem the race to urge: So rash, so sportive once, a happy child, My new existence filled with rapture wild, I too snatched pleasure strange, like them, on danger's verge. But morning breezes bear no healing breath To her, whose first friend is in earth laid low. Nor grass, nor sheep, can teach the heart to glow, Whose loved companion is the prey of Death: Nor life first bursting all around is sweet To eyes that mark'd life ebb in one so dear; Nor Nature's universal smile can cheer Her, who is doomed no more her sister's smile to meet. SONNET OCCASIONED BY A DREAM. Oft when life's cares, and woes, and fears are fled, Swept by the wing of hovering sleep away, Fair dreams enchanting float around my head, (Enchanting dreams, for of my sisters they), And all the heaven of my early day Fresh dawns upon me; and around me glows Each sparkling eye, with youth, and hope, once gay, Now closed for ever, or now dimm'd by woes: My weary spirit tastes of joy again In sweet illusion, when a creeping thrill Of horror, boding some impending ill, Half thought—half felt—renews the sense of pain; Affrighted sleep spreads his swift wings for flight, Fair dreams and sister forms quick snatching from my sight. Feb. 1801. TO A YOUNG LADY ON HER APPROACHING MARRIAGE. Oh! never may the hope that lights thine eye, Sweet maid! be changed to disappointment's gloom! Never, th' ingenuous frolic laugh I prize To the forced smile that care must oft assume! But may the blissful dream of thy young heart— That dream from which so many wake too late— Of joys that love requited shall impart, Be realized in thy approaching fate! And may I meet that frolic laugh again, When time shall mix thy raven locks with grey, Nor on thy brow detect the trace of pain, Open as now, ingenuous, and gay; And calling to thy mind my terrors vain, “My dream is realized,” oh may'st thou say! Aug. 1801. BOUTS RIMÉS GIVEN BY A YOUNG FRIEND AT SUPPER, AND FILLED ON THE SPOT, ADDRESSED TO HIM. O! that I could my lab'ring thought so dress That grave rebuke might wear an aspect gay, So should I wake fair virtue's sleeping ray In thy young breast, thy riper age to bless. So shouldst thou crown thy father's visions bright, And, nobly roused, from Pleasure's shackles free, Thy genius and thy worth should then agree; Nor wouldst thou Reason's sober dictates slight. Then wise and gentle, generous and brave, Thy brow should thy soul's character assume, Whose lasting trace should dignify the gloom Of age one day, nor fade till in the grave. Awake! awake! disdain each worthless care, Spurn Pleasure's tinsel chain, and nobly dare! Sept. 1801. ON DUNSTONBURGH CASTLE. WRITTEN UNDER THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS MADE BY THE NEWS OF PEACE IN OCTOBER 1801. Majestic Ruins! that so sadly speak The glory of past days, and seem to grow To the huge rock, high, desolate, and bleak, That curbs the ocean tossing far below; Shatter'd by time and war, sublime ye stand In awful solitude!—on either side, How vast the waste of water, or of land! Above your head th' expanse of Heaven how wide! Now round your hoary battlements dark frown The threat'ning skies! while sudden from the west The setting sun a radiant beam has thrown, That gilds each fretted stone on your broad breast. Touch'd by the glorious light, your turrets now Gleam on the heavy clouds that roll away With sullen pride,—again your deep-scarr'd brow Smiles terrible beneath the evening ray. So o'er thy ruins too, more awful far, And far more sad, my country! heaven-born Peace Her radiance flings, that gilds thy every scar, While backward rolling, Fate's dark tempests cease. So smiling terrible, through nature's tears, Fancy might paint thy veterans, with clasp'd hands, O'er the void tombs that vain affection rears To sons, to brothers, fallen in hostile lands; The gallant youths, alas! thy strength, and pride, England! who in thy cause, yet not in Freedom's died! SONNET. [See the poor captive from his dungeon break] See the poor captive from his dungeon break, Where long he pined, and hail the light of day, With eyes that in the broad effulgence ache, With smiles that mid deep lines of anguish play! How eagerly he meets the morning gale, With lab'ring lungs that each sweet breath would seize! How fondly views the hill, the plain, the vale, Green meadows, brooks, fields, flow'rs, and waving trees! And, “Gods!” he cries, “how dear is Liberty! Is there in Heaven's large gift a boon beside? The world is mine, and all the good I see!” But soon, too soon, his raptures wild subside, And sighing sad, “Not Freedom's self to me Is sweet,” he cries, “if one to share it be denied.” IMITATION OF BURNS. TO THOMAS GRAHAM OF BALGOWAN, NOW LORD LYNEDOCH. In cauld death lock'd is mute the tongue That best thy virtues could ha' sung, On lyre the muse hersel' had strung To Scottish lays, Till on the inmost heart had rung Thy well-earn'd praise. Yet when the lark his song has closed, And cozie 'mang the grass is housed, Wi' head beneath his wing composed, The houlet shrill Shrieks, by the dewy night-air roused, Wi' fearless bill. So I, by ventrous friendship led, Though thy own country's bard be dead, And, weeping, every muse be fled Wi' Burns away, Wad weave a garland for thy head O' Scottish bay! Wad fain thy dauntless valour sing, Resistless as the tempest's wing That wave on wave does dashing fling Upo' the shore; Yet mild thy soul as breath of spring When war is o'er. But och! in vain I glowre and spell Thy social merits a' to tell, And thou maun aiblins blush thysel' Sic strains to hear, For Virtue loves in shade to dwell Wi' modest fear. June 17, 1802. STANZAS SUGGESTED BY A CANZONE OF PETRARCH. “Amor se vuoi ch' i torni al giogo antico.”P.2.C.2. Away, proud boy, away! thou canst not harm; Seize not thy unstrung bow, nor aim thy dart, Void is thy quiver, nerveless is thine arm, Vanish'd thy cruel empire o'er my heart: No more a mighty God Art thou, whose sov'reign nod To worlds can woes and terrors wild impart; No more I bend and weep before thy throne, And sigh my soul away, unheeded and alone. Hence, tyrant urchin, hence! and humbly lay At the cold foot of Death thy broken bow; Death's iron hand has borne thy torch away, Death! mightier Death! proud victor, bends thee low. A feeble child thou art, And aim'st a pointless dart. Arm'd by despair, my bosom dares the blow— Thy baby archery I laugh to scorn— Away! and leave me here, my liberty to mourn. Or if once more thou wouldst me of thy train, Seek thou my treasure in the earth laid low; And if it be that thy unbounded reign O'er Heaven extend, and o'er th' abyss below, Burst thou the sacred tomb, That clasp'd in early bloom The form to which alone my soul can bow! Wrest thou from Death the prize he bore away, And in her charms resume thy universal sway. Hang on that brow the same sad pensive weight, Then wake that smile that might awake the dead, Bright as the glittering beam of orient light Breaks o'er a weeping sky when storms are fled! And breathe those sounds again, Thrilling through every vein, Sounds that to thoughts of Heaven the fancy led, While the rapt soul hung fondly on each note, Which on the ear, when past, long sweetly seem'd to float. And those luxuriant locks, with art control'd, In glossy braids around her temples bind, Now in an envious net of twisted gold Be all their waving glories close confined; Now loosed from every band, With sly and sportive hand Toss them in ringlets on the wanton wind, Then bind me, gazing, to thy car again, And I will kiss my bonds, and hug once more my chain! FRAGMENT, ON THE IMPRESS OF THE SEAMEN OF THE FLEET FROM INDIA TO MAN THE KING'S SHIPS. This fleet had been attacked, on its homeward bound passage, by the French squadron commanded by Admiral Linois. The senior officer, Captain Dance, not only resisted the attack of the French admiral, but actually compelled him to fly with his flag and men of war, before the armed merchantmen of England. AUGUST, 1804. Mark ye the towering vessels, dimly seen, That throng the horizon? freighted with the wealth Of either world, as their proud bosoms stem The opposing surge, tossing their big sails high, Exulting!—for they bring their treasure home, And, laden as they are, have quell'd the foe Who durst impede their course. The lioness Thus homeward bears the prey, to nature true, And in a mother's fond end uring love Terrible, although th' unerring spear Aim'd by the hunter gore her panting side: So, bounding o'er the billows, ride our fleets, To reach the land that owns the sacred name Of home; and high among the shrouds, brave hearts Beat towards that home with strong tumultuous joy. The deep-scarr'd mariner, in thought already Snatches the dear ones to his arms, long left In penury, and for whose sake alone He dared th' Atlantic surge, the tempest's rage, The thunder of the foe, and dire disease. Perchance escaped the fatal fever's sweep, With alter'd looks, languid and sad, some pine For inland sweets, green fields, umbrageous woods, And trickling rills refreshing to the soul. How many eyes that wept not when they saw, Weltering in blood, their mangled comrades fall, Now swim in tears at sight of the white cliffs That gird their native isle! How many ears That, unappall'd, have heard the cannons roar, With quivering nerves now strain the trembling sense To catch the shout faint-wafted from the strand! Haply the youth, who utter'd not a groan When the jagg'd steel erewhile his shatter'd limb Slow-sever'd, heaves the tender sigh, unmann'd, To think how joyfully his coming waits The doting mother—who shall see him thus! But ah! no more shall he, the deep-scarr'd veteran, In his fond arms his dear ones clasp; nor he, Sad pining after late disease, shall gaze On inland verdure, nor inhale the airs Fraught with unnumber'd sweets from flow'rets breathed, Fresh herbs salubrious, and the steamy earth; Nor they, who with moist eyes descry these cliffs, Shall view them nearer, nor with eager step Print the loved soil; nor shall the trembling sense Aught seize of an applauding country's shouts, Save the faint sound by pitying winds convey'd. For lo! forth rushing from the shore, are sped The fatal barks, with cruel purpose wing'd, And sudden torn from yet but fancied joys, Despotic power condemns them, thus o'ertoil'd, To labours new, and all the ills of war! And shall their countrymen her bidding do? Gods! shall they grasp the unsuspecting hand, Outstretch'd to greet with honest joy these men As brothers,—and the mandate fell declare? TO PSYCHE Mrs. Tighe, authoress of the poem so called, was herself called Psyche, by her friends. ON READING HER POEM. Who hears the lark's wild rapturous carol shrill, Nor feels with kindred joy his bosom glow? Who, the lone owl's loud dismal shriek of woe, Nor starts as with a sense of coming ill? The mingled bleatings that at evening fill The dewy air with tender sounds, that flow From mother's love, all answering hearts avow, Such sympathy does nature's voice instil! What wonder, then, if the enchanting lay In which the soul of love and virtue blend Their force resistless, and thy heart pourtray, While all the Nine their fascination lend, That the rapt fancy the strong spell obey, Greeting thee, unknown Psyche! as a friend? April, 1806. PSYCHE'S ANSWER. Lady, forgive if late the languid lyre, At length responsive to thy sweetest lay, Breathe its low trembling chord with weak essay, To utter all my grateful thoughts inspire; Forgive, if vacant of poetic fire I seem with frigid heart and dull delay The flattering summons careless to obey; Woo'd, kindly woo'd, so highly to aspire, And echo the soft name of friend!—for me, Alas! for me, in anguish and in fear, The darkling days have since rolled heavily; But go, my Psyche! in her partial ear Whisper the sad excuse; and bid her see In thine, the “sister form” most fair, most dear! May 7th, 1807. TRANSLATION OF HORACE'S ODE TO GROSPHUS. The above paraphrase was undertaken at the desire of a friend, who accompanied the request with a literal translation in English prose. Had I understood the original, or been, at the time, aware how peculiarly unfitted to the character of Horace is that more expanded metre which I adopted, I should have employed a shorter measure, and have attempted a more compressed style. The mariner on the Egean tost, Sighs for repose, when from the pilot's sight The moon is shrouded, and th' uncertain light Of friendly stars in gathering clouds is lost. The Thracian, terrible to armed foes, Asks of the Gods repose; Repose the weary Median fain would know Who bends th' unerring bow; Repose, my Grosphus, not by gold procured, By robes of Tyrian dye, nor precious gems ensured. For not the wealth proud Persia can display, Th' attendant lictor, and the consul's state, The lofty dome, and all the gifts of fate, Can the wild tumults of the soul allay, And still the breast; nor from the fretted roof Keep fluttering cares aloof: Blest who, content with little, simply fares, Whose board no goblet bears, Save one descended from his frugal sires; His rest by fears unbroke, or sordid, base desires. Ah why this breath of life so fleeting prize? With distant aim why projects idly form? Why climates seek that other sun-beams warm? Say, can the wretch who from his country flies, Fly from himself?—Destructive care e'en now Mounts the tall vessel's prow! Behold the warrior on the rapid steed! Swift care o'ertakes his speed! Swifter than flies the stag that, startled, springs, Swifter than Eurus bears the clouds upon his wings. The man of mind serene, beyond to-day No thought will take, still on the present fixt; And if his cup with bitterness be mixt, The cheerful smile upon his lip will play, Tempering the draught—for not on earth below May we each blessing know: Renown'd Achilles in his manly bloom Found an untimely tomb: Tithonus languish'd in eternal years, And Time may snatch from thee what he for me prepares. Sicilian cows, and herds unnumber'd, low Along thy meads; eager thy coursers neigh, That in the chariot race thy hand obey; Gorgeous with purple dye thy vestures glow. To me the gentle fates (my promised meed) An humble farm decreed; O'er my rapt thought in happy hour to feel The Grecian muse soft steal; And a calm soul, that with determined choice Shuns the malignant world, and scorns its idle voice. Jan. 1805. SONG. [Though I may never more behold] Though I may never more behold Thine eye of heaven's blue, And catch the timid glance that told Thy heart so fond and true; By memory's magic force I feel That eye still on me beam, And half its pang from absence steal, Lull'd by the waking dream. The smile that on thy lips erewhile So kindly wont to play, That could each idle care beguile Of Love's first golden day; Now, when lone fancy rules the hour, At evening's lingering close, Comes o'er my soul with mightier power To soothe my real woes. SONG [Shall this pale cheek no pity claim] SET TO MUSIC BY MISS PARKE. Shall this pale cheek no pity claim, That thou wert wont to swear Might opening damask roses shame? Ah! if that hue no more it wear, Thine, cruel! be alone the blame, Who hung wan lilies there. And is this eye, with tears o'erfraught, To thine no longer known? This eye that read the tender thought, Erewhile soft trembling in thine own; By thee, alas! to weep, since, taught, And all its lustre flown. Thou, who hast clouded with despair My joyous break of day, And blighted what to thee seem'd fair, Youth's mantling bloom, and smile so gay; Tear from my heart, in pity tear, The power to love away! H. C. P. July, 1806. SONG. NANNIE ATTIE. FROM NATURE. SET TO THE TUNE OF “THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST.” And do I see the bairn again That first I rock'd upo' my knee? The bairn whose earliest moan I hush'd, The bairn whose first smile dwelt on me? Ah! turn aside the lock sae brown That hides fra' me thy bonnie brow; For dim with age these eyes are grown, And tears of gladness blind them now. Fu' twenty years ha' stolen by Since Nannie Attie saw thy face; And these auld eyes or see amiss, Or still see ilk remember'd grace. Then turn aside, &amp;c. The same thy ivory temples clear, Sae kind the things thy young eye said; 'Twas here I traced the vein sae blue, 'Twas here the thought sae pure I read. Then turn aside, &amp;c. Southill, Jan. 1808. SONG. [The paleness stealing o'er thy cheek] The paleness stealing o'er thy cheek To me betray'd thy pitying thought, And ill thy faltering tongue could speak The cruel lesson pride had taught: Oh give me back the lingering smile, That bade me hope, though you denied! Oh let me live in doubt awhile, And follow, blind, my blindfold guide! SONG. [The tell-tale Sun is in the sea] The tell-tale Sun is in the sea, Now fades the last pale, lingering, light, And thou hast sworn to fly with me Beneath the friendly veil of night. What though the loud wind rock the grove, And rudely toss thy raven hair? Wild Nature's haunts are those of Love, And peace and liberty are there. Why shudd'ring press thee to my side? Why start, my love, with doubt and fear? 'Twas but the bird of night that cried! Hark! 'tis the torrent tumbling near! If love like mine thy heart has known, To other cares and joys 'tis seal'd; Love mocks all sorrows but his own, And damps each joy he does not yield! H. C. P. Feb. 1808. LINES [Ever still must I adore thee] COMPOSED FOR A PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC. Ever still must I adore thee, Though wide seas between us roll, Each fond thought shall hover o'er thee, And thy image fill my soul: Morning breaking on the ocean, Will thy opening graces wear; And with evening's last devotion I will breathe thy name in prayer. Tossing sad mid waters boundless, While for thee I live, Ah! wilt thou, dear one, give A sigh—a tear—to me? Is the doubt tormenting groundless? Yes, I read thine eye; Faithful I again shall clasp thee Ere I die: Ever still must I adore thee, Though wide seas between us roll, Each fond thought shall hover o'er thee, And thy image fill my soul. Morning breaking on the ocean, Will thy opening graces wear; And with evening's last devotion I will breathe thy name in prayer. July, 1809. SONNET ON SEEING THE BUST OF THE LATE SAWREY GILPIN. My friend! my father! here thy heavenly mien, Here the last smile thy parting spirit hung On thy cold lips, as passing forth serene It sought the fount of love from whence it sprung, Sorrowing I trace, and think how I have seen Thy meek eye beam sublime, while rapt thy tongue Told of Heaven's mercy, as each note had been To win the wanderer home, divinely strung! The loved, the honour'd, kind, parental air, Impress'd upon the cold and senseless stone, My streaming eye, and bursting heart declare, As when in youth's wild joyous day, long flown, With smiles benignant, such as fathers wear, “My child,” thou saidst, as I had been thine own. May, 1807. WILLIAM AND SARAH: A BALLAD. FROM NATURE. Mark yon low roof beside the road! Old William, blind and poor, lived there, And Sarah, bow'd beneath the load Of age, and sickness, want, and care. When suffering most she breathed no groan, But spoke with cheerful utterance still, Thankful for blessings she had known, For William's sake she welcomed ill. And still it was her nightly prayer To live to close his sightless eyes; For this her torturing pains to bear, Then sink in death ere morning rise. “For who, when Sarah is laid low, Will be,” she said, “poor William's friend? Who spread his board, who smooth his brow? Who on his wayward age attend? “Ah! who th' uncertain staff will guide With which he feels, amiss, his way? And careful lay the stone aside That might his tottering footstep stay? “Who lead him to the shelter'd stile That fronts the sun at noontide hour? And watch the western clouds the while To warn him of the gathering shower? “When thunders roll above our head, And the storm rocks our humble wall; Then helpless blindness shrinks with dread, Though nought the conscience pure appal! “Who then, his listening ear to cheat, Shall name our children far away, And wake each recollection sweet, Till they in thought around him play? “A smile faint-stealing o'er his cheek, His eye-balls then in vacant space Will seem each cherub face to seek,— On memory stampt a cherub face,— “For thirty years have o'er them roll'd, Since my good man our girls could see; Our sons have thirty harvests told Since rosy boys around his knee; “And want, and time, have, on each brow, For smiles deep lines of care portray'd, And cherub faces round them now So bloom,—and so are doom'd to fade! “Ah! none but Sarah can retrace Each snatch of joy he e'er has known!— E'en on the fallow's barren space, A wild flower here and there has blown! “Then be it still my nightly prayer, To live to close his sightless eyes, For this my torturing pains to bear, Then sink in death ere morning rise!” With steadfast hope, and faith serene, The humble prayer of duteous love, Pour'd ardent forth, in anguish keen, Was heard, where mercy rules above! Old William, drooping, softly dosed, And without pain resign'd his breath; His sightless eyes poor Sarah closed, And, grateful, sunk ere morn in death. Worthy, Oct. 1809. FABLE. TO MY CHILD, IN ANSWER TO HER “VISION OF MIRZA.” Nay, little dreamer, hear me too! May I not dream as well as you? I've visions also, I can tell ye. Methought, that journeying towards Delhi, High mounted on a camel's back, (A hump-back'd, ewe-neck'd, eastern hack), Exhausted, weary, thirsty, hot, I 'lighted on a verdant spot, Where as I sat to rest and muse, Flowers spread their bosoms of all hues; And lo! these various flowers among Gay butterflies in bevies throng! One little troop I chiefly note, That in the soft airs idly float, With gorgeous wings of velvet plume, Wrought, one would swear, in Iris' loom, And by her pencil taught to glow With tints prepared to deck her bow. But now observe the strangest thing! These butterflies of glorious wing Seem'd still to float, with one consent, From flow'r to flow'r, wherever went A little yellow butterfly, Of small regard to catch the eye; Of such are seen the homely race That England's lukewarm dog-days grace. Now this fond, fickle, fluttering fly Leads to a rose-bud blooming nigh, And when to taste its sweets they think, It beckons to the chequer'd pink; Now round the woodbine shapes its flight, But cannot fix on which t' alight: Then flitting sideways towards the lily, It spies the vulgar daffodilly, Or wheeling with a pironette, Sudden descries the violet; Yet scarcely has the perfume caught Ere orange flowers claim a thought, Or gaudy tulips strike its fancy, Or, “freakt with jet,” th' immortal pansy. And now methought the evening hour Stole on the scene, and every flower Profuse, a double perfume flung, While dews upon the still air hung. The blue-bells see the planet sink, And hang their heads, while daisies wink, And lapt convolvoluses sleep Till on their lids again he peep. 'Twas now the little yellow thing Began to droop the cheerless wing, And labour in its giddy flight, Clogg'd by the chilly damps of night. The butterflies in insect tongue, Now one and all, or said, or sung, “Look, sisters! whither flies the Sun? Ah! whither, ere our race be run? Just now he gave us life and light, Nor thought we of such things as Night, And we have no provision made! The dew will spoil my rich brocade.” Cries one, “My golden spots look dim, That in the sun's beam rival'd him!” Another, “See, my crimson hue And purple tints are turning blue!” The thoughtless troop thus put to rout, Marked an old bee that buzz'd about, A plodding, bustling, busy soul, Who still, en passant, something stole, Poking within their cups her nose, Ere sleepy flowers their leaves could close. Her bundling figure they deride, With thighs like pockets on each side; The sober bee their quizzing hears, And thus she buzzes in their ears: “To sport beneath a summer sun, And still from sweet to sweet to run, To aim at all, on none to dwell, Is not to taste e'en pleasure well: Learn from old mother Bee this truth: Some toil may sweeten even youth.” Haply this hum-drum, drowsy speech, Like others fared that wisdom preach; But such a buzzing round my head Awoke me—in my own tent bed. H. C. P. Feb. 15th, 1808. IMITATION OF BURNS. FRAGMENT, IN REPLY TO A LETTER OF AN ARDENT ADMIRER OF BURNS, WHICH CONTAINED EXPRESSIONS TOO COMPLIMENTARY TO MYSELF. Ah! find some city hizzie bra', Nor seek auld Wolsey's mouldering wa', To throw sic courtly parle awa', Auld crones amang, As wad turn tapsaltary a' Brains mickle strang.

TO MR. YOUNG, ON HIS READING TAM O' SHANTER WITH PECULIAR SPIRIT. The same rude winds wi' mighty sweep Upheave the waters of the deep, To dash them on ilk jutting steep Their fury meets, And cozie 'mang low flowrets creep, Stealing their sweets. And suns that rear the forest's pride, To bear upo' the subject tide Britannia's thunders far and wide, Wi' milder ray Will glint adown the copse-wood side On ilka spray. So thou wi' learn'd and tunefu' tongue Wilt pour, mellifluous, full, and strong, Great Shakspeare's bold, creative song Wi' master skill, Resistless to the listening throng Thou sway'st at will: And Tam o' Shanter, roaring fou, By thee embodied to our view, The rustic bard wad own sae true He scant could tell, Wha 'twas the living picture drew, Thou, or himsel! ALICE AND MARIAN: A BALLAD. The dewy hour was wearing late, And from the upland field The cows were lowing at the gate, Their evening store to yield. Sad Alice heeded not the sound, Nor mark'd her feather'd care, That throng'd, and peck'd, her foot around, The wonted grain to share; And when, at length, the streamlets flow Beneath her listless hand, Wayward, she chides the patient cow, Though motionless she stand: And from her hazle eye down roll Big tears upon her cheek, While sighs, wrung from her inmost soul, Its bitter anguish speak. “'Mong April buds his vows were made, And ere those buds could blow, His vows,” she cried, “were all betray'd, And they are Marian's now. “I must forget that ere I heard That voice so false, so dear! Alas! how could I doubt his word, While mine was so sincere? “I must not think how heavenly sweet That smile would on me beam! Too well I know it was a cheat, And all I felt—a dream! “It is with merry Marian now He laughs from morn till noon; But thy tears, cruel! thine may flow Ere wane the harvest moon! “Though Marian's frolic mirth so gay The sultry hay-field cheer, Say, when the short, cold, sunless day Shall close the parting year, “Will her gay smile then beam as bright, And beam for only thee? Will winter's toils to her seem light As they had seem'd to me? “Say, will she trim thy evening hearth? Duteous thy meal prepare? Nor know—nor dream—a bliss on earth, Save but to see thee there? “I too with laughter will beguile My bosom's secret smart— And I could laugh—but that his smile Still hangs about my heart. “These silly tears! they shall not tell Gay Marian all my woe;” But as she speaks they bigger swell, And down her pale cheek flow. “I will avoid,” she cries, “the shade Where first he told his pain, The stile where his false vows were made I ne'er will see again. “And when I drive my cows afield I will go round a mile; For as I once, so Marian now Fond loiters by that stile.” Yet heedless of the new-made vow Of love's relenting wrath, Behind her cows, sad pacing slow, She winds the wonted path. She shudder'd as the beach-tree flung O'er her its lengthen'd shade; Shudder'd, for there, fond loitering, hung Marian, the laughing maid! The false one, too, hard by she watch'd, Among the copse-wood glide; A trembling hope poor Alice snatch'd— “He is not by her side!” Thus Love the faithful bosom wings With every jealous care! Thus Hope to some vain shadow clings Ere all be blank despair! Alice, her bosom's peace thus lost, The long sad summer pined, And now the yellow leaves are tost By every gust of wind. The hoar frost glitters in the morn, The evening closes chill; The fields are bare where waved the corn, And clouds hang o'er the hill. For gayer scenes the laughing maid Forsook the sadden'd plain, And he, the faithless one, repaid Poor Alice pain for pain. TO UGO FOSCOLO, WITH A SNUFF-BOX. Ugo, not mine to scan the high control, That wrings for Ortis' woes the honest tear, And bids us tremble with Ricciarda's fear, But to the poet's mastery yield my soul! The patriot course that shall thy name enroll 'Mong those who most have held their country dear— More dear her glory! and in exile drear Have borne their honour'd sorrows—Fame's proud scroll Shall give to after-times!—My task to tell Of spells that win thee back to lowly earth, Though in ideal worlds thy genius dwell; The beaming eye where wit and softness blend! The homelier radiance of the social hearth, Haply, e'en now, this bauble from a Friend! Nov. 1820. THE END.</field>
