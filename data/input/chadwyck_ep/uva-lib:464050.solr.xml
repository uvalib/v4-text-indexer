      <field name="fulltext">Here gynneþe þe sermon þat a clerk made þat was cleput Alquyn To Gwy of WarwykSquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Speculum Gy de Warewyke. Herkneþ alle to my speche, And hele of soule i may ou teche. Þat i wole speke, it is no fable, Ac hit is swiþe profitable. Man, if þu wolt heuene winne, Þurw loue to god þu most biginne. Þus shal ben þi biginning: Þu loue god ouer alle þing And þin emcristene loue also, Riht as þi-self[e] þu most do. If þu wolt þus biginne and ende, Þu miht be seker to heuene wende; Ac, if þu louest more worldes god Þan god him-self[e] in þi mod, Þu shalt hit finde an yuel plawe: To deþ of soule it wole þe drawe, For, whan þe world þe haþ ikauht In his paunter þurw his drauht, Al at his wille he wole þe lede. Ne shaltu spare for no drede, Ne for loue to god, ne for his ei?e, To gon out of þe rihte weye; For swiche [þer] beþ, þat loueþ more Þe world and his foule lore, Þan þeih don god, þat hem wrouhte And on þe rode [hem] dere bouhte. Her-of i wole a while dwelle, And a tale i wole ?ou telle Off an eorl of gode fame— Gy of Warwyk was his name— Hou on a time he stod in þouht: Þe worldes blisse him þouhte noht. Þe world anon he þer forsok And to Iesu Crist him tok, And louede god and his lore And in his seruise was euere more. A god man þer was in þilke dawe, Þat liuede al in godes lawe; Alquin was his rihte name, And man he was of gode fame; Dekne he was, and þe ordre he hadde; In holinesse his lyf he ladde; Wit of clergie he hadde inouh, Þerfore to godnesse euere he drouh. Off him þe eorl was wel war, Þerfore his wille to him [he] bar, And of him he tok his red, To kepen his soule from þe qued. On a day, i vnderstonde, Sire Gy þe eorl sente his sonde To þe holi man Alquin And seide: ‘[I] grete þe wel, fader myn, And preie þe for godes loue, Þat us alle sit aboue, Þat þu wole, par charite And in amendement of me, Make me a god sarmoun And don hit write in lesczoun: Þat were my ioye and my delit And to my soule a gret profyt; For þe world þurw his foule gile Haþ me lad to longe while. Þer-of i wole consail take, Hu i mihte þe world forsake.’ Alquin þe eorl þo answerede, And Iesu Crist ful ?erne he heriede, Þat swich a wit was comen him to And seide: ‘His preie i wole do.’ ‘And, [sethen] i shal be þi leche, Aller furst i wole þe teche, Faire uertuz for to take And foule þewes to forsake. Þat maitou noht don, leue broþer, Bote þu knowe on and oþer, I shal þe now shewe boþe, Whiche beþ gode and whiche beþ loþe; And at þe beste i wole biginne, Þe betre grace for to winne. Þe uertuz i wole first shewe, Whiche þeih beþ, alle on rewe.’ ‘Wisdom in godes drede Vse wel, þat be my rede; Trewe bileue and charite— Þise sholen bileue wid þe— Stedefast hope and mieknesse, Pes, merci, and for?ifnes, Loue of herte, ful of pite, Þat is verray humilite. And þu wolt haue godes ore, ?it þu most vse more, For þi sinne repentaunce, And redi þerfore to don penaunce Wid sorwe at þin herte rote, And shrifte of mouþe shal be þi bote. In almes dede and charite Þi lyf shal euere more be. Þise beþ þe þewes, þat i þe teche, Whar-þurw þu miht to heuene reche, And so þu miht þe world forsake, If þu wolt hem to þe take.’ ‘Nu i wole nempne þe wicke þewes, Þat beþ noht gode, ac muche shrewes, For, if þu dost bi here red[e], To strong[e] pine þeih wolen þe led[e]; Þanne is hit god, þat þu shone To drawe hem into þi wone. Herkne nouþe to me, And i hem wole nempne þe: Pride, wraþþe, and enuie, Fals iugement and tricherie; Fals witnesse is on of þo— Many a soule itt doþ ful wo. Loue noht to muche þis worldes blisse: Hit bringeþ man to þisternesse, Auarice and glotonye, Wicke sleuþe and leccherie.’ ‘Accedie is a wel foul sinne To man, þat he may come widinne, And, what it is, i wole þe wisse, Vnderstond, þat þu ne misse: Accedie is (as) sleuþes broþer, Wicke on and wicke oþer; Hit is a derne mourni[n]g in mod And makeþ man anuied to do god. Offte þurw swiche mourning[e] Wanhope beginneþ for to spring[e], Þat, bote man turne awey þerfro, Sauued worþ he neuere mo. Wroþer hele was Iudas born, For þurw þat sinne he was lorn; Merci he les þurw þat sinne, Wher-þurw he ne mihte no ioye winne. Vch man birede him in his sihte To flen þat sinne bi his mihte And alle oþere þat i haue nempt, If he wole to ioye be dempt.’ Herkne now to my sarmoun, What i wole telle in my lesczoun. Wisdom in godes drede, De Sapientia. Off which þat i erere seide, Tweie þinges it wole þe teche, Whar-þurw þu miht to heuene reche: Þat is, lat þi sinne and do god For his loue, þat deiede on rod; Ac to late þi sinne al onliche Nis noht inouh, sikerliche. Þu most don god forþ þerwid, If þu wolt haue merci and griþ. Þis wonder of many sinful men, Þat þinkeþ it were muche for hem To haue gret worldes honour As londes, rentes, halle, and bour, Riche vessel of siluer and gold And grete tresor and faire bold, Riche mete and riche drink[e], And litel þerfore for to swink[e], Hele of bodi in bon and huide, And gret los of pompe and pride. A murie lyf hem þinkeþ þis were, But eft hit worþ ibouht [ful] dere, Quia nihil in-felicius, quam felicitas peccatoris. Naþeles hit may falle wel, Þat, þouh man haue muche katel As londes, rentes, and oþer god, ?it he may be pore of mod And low of herte, ful iwis, And halt þerof ful litel prys. Ac nu i wole speke and rede Of hem, þat i erere seide, Þat þurw here pride and here wil Þeih fallen ofte in gret peril. Seint Austin halt þer-mide noht And seiþ, it shal ben dere bouht, And skilfulliche it mot be so, For, whan a man haþ sinne do, Oþer he mot hit beten here Or suffre pine elles where. Wole ?e here, what louerede God kudde to hem þat wole him drede? [He wyll hem here hold[e] lowe, For þei schold hym þe better knawe;] He wole hem chasten wid smale pining And maken hem lese þat hote brenning; And many anguisse he wole hem ?iue To suffre here, whiles þeih liue, As hunger and þurst and trauail strong; Hij sholen haue euere among Lore of catel and seknesse, And al is to echen here blisse. Man, if þu (ne) leuest noht me, Þu sek aboute, and þu miht se Þise holi men alle bidene, How þeih liuede in wo and tene. And, if my tale nis noht for-?ete, Þanne maitou wel iwite, Þat þe worldes blisse is noht, Whan þu hast abouten souht; For, ?if a man haþ her his wille, Wel lihtliche he may spille. Her i wole nouþe blinne. De Fide. Anoþer þing i wole biginne To speke, man, of þi bileue, For hit is god, it wole noht greue. Man, þi bileue shal be so: Þat o god is and no mo, Þat o god is in vnite, Þre persones in trinite. Þu shalt, [man], bileue also And treuliche in þin herte do, Þat god had neuere biginning Ne neuere (ne) shal haue ending, And shappere is of alle shaftes, And ?eueþ wit in alle craftes, And made man after his owen face— Nas þat gret loue of heih[e] grace? And ?af to man fre power To chese, boþe fer and ner, Off god and yuel shed to make, Þe euel to late and god to take. Wheiþer he wole chese, he haþ power Þurw ?ifte of god, while he is her; Þanne is hit noht on god ilong, If man wole chese to don wrong. Adam was þe forme man, Þat euere singyn bigan, And þat was god to wite noht, Þerfore hit haþ ben dere bouht. God ?af him wit as his owen, God and yuel for to knowen, Ac þurw eging of þe fend and Eue He dede a sinne þat gan him greue. Vnboxomnesse was his gilt, Þerfore out of paradys he was [pylt]. Boxomere he was to his wif, Þan to god þat ?af him lyf; And, for he dede after hire lore, He bouhte hit siþþen swiþe sore. His fredom was binomen him al And put in seruage as a þral, Noht one he, bute alle þo Þat of him comen for euere mo. Ac for hit was þurw gile don, God ?af his pite þer-vpon, And eke for loue þat he hade To man, þat he himselue made, To sauue man, man he bicam, And pine for hem to him he nam, And ?af for hem his herte blod, And deiede for hem on þe rod. Ibiried he was, in toumbe he lay, Til hit com þe þridde day; Vp he ros þe þridde day From deþ to liue wid-oute nay; To heuene he steih þurw his mihte, Riht in-to his faderes sihte, And sit on his faderes riht[e] side, Þe grete dom for to abide. Þider he wole come on domesday, Cruwel and sterne wid-oute nay, He þat was woned to be Meke as a lomb, ful of pite: Þeder he wole lihten adoun Wraþfful and sterne as a lioun. Merci nele he shewe non, Ac, riht after þat man haþ don, He shal fonge his iugement To ioye or to strong turment. Allas! what sholen hij onne take, Þat wolden [here] her god forsake Þurw sinne of fles[c]h[ly] liking, And wolde hit bete wid no pining? Þer-fore þeih sholen in-to helle, Wheiþer þeih wolen, or þeih nelle, And þere bileue[n] euere mo, In [as] strong pine as men may do. Seint Austin spekeþ of alle swiche And seiþ wordes [ful] reuliche: Habent mortem sine morte et finem mortis sine fine. ‘Hij sholen haue deþ wid-oute deiing And point of deþ wid-outen ending;’ Here deþ hij sholen wilnen euere, Ac to ende of deþ comen hij neuere; Hij sholen euere more duire In stronge pine of hote fire. Her i wole nouþe dwelle, And of mur[y]ere þinge [i wole] ?ou telle. Tellen i wole ful iwis Off þe ioyes of paradys, Whiche godes children, þat gode be, Sholen haue and ise; Ac, þouh i hadde in my bayli[e] Þe wit of alle clergy[e], Mihte hit neuere so bifalle, Þat i mihte telle[n] alle. Ac, also god ?if me grace, I shal ?ou shewe in þis place, What ioie þeih sholen han ifere, Þat seruen god on eorþe here. Whan þeih sholen parten henne, Ful wel þeih sholen here weie kenne Riht to þe blisse of paradys, Þat god haþ ?arked to alle his. Þere is euere ioye inouh And euere riht widouten wouh, Wit and kunning and kointise, And trewe loue widou[t] feintise, Streinþe inouh and fairnesse, And liht wid-oute þisternesse. Þere sholen þeih noht ben agilt, [For] al here wille shal ben fulfilt: Hij sholen haue, mid iwisse, Fulle ioye and fulle blisse, Boþe þe pore and þe riche, Ac, wete þu wel, noht alle iliche. Euerich shal haue his woni?[i]ng Riht after his owen deseruing; Ac lat hit noht come in þi þouht, Þat any of hem shal wanten ouht, For he þat haþ lest in þat woniing Haþ fulle ioye ouer alle þing. Þerfore, man, in al þi miht, Þu loue wel god bi day and niht: Þe inwardlichere þu louest him her, Þe more shal ben þi ioye þer. Herkne nu alle to me, For i wole speken of charite. De uera Caritate. Off alle uertuz hit is hext, And godes wille hit is next. ?if þu wolt wite [what] hit be, Herkne, and i wole telle þe: Hit is, loue god ouer alle þing, In þouht, in dede, and in speking. And, if þu wolt euere come þerto, An-oþer þing þu most do: Þu most loue, hu-so hit be, Þin emcristene forþ wid þe. Man, woltou make a god prouing, Wher þu loue þe heuene king? If þu louest god ful iwis, Þu [wolt] louen alle his. Si non diligis proximum tuum, quem uides, deum quem non uides, quomodo potes diligere?For men seiþ soþ, bi wit[te] myne: ‘Whoso loueþ me, he loueþ myne.’ ‘But þu loue [þyn em] cristene þat bi þe be, Þat alday [þou] mait hem ise, Hou maitou loue god, i ne can deuise, Whom þu miht sen on none wyse!’ Þis seiþ sein Powel and bereþ witnesse, As he may wel in soþ[e]nesse. Abraham him sauh, ac þu [nost] noht hou! Herkne, i wole þe telle nowh: Þe fourme of þre children he mette, Þre he sauh, and (as) on he (hem) grette; In tokne it was, i telle þe, Off þe holi trinite. Holliche as on he grette hem þere In tokne of o god, þat hij were. Hu Moyses him sauh, woltou here, In fourme of a bush al on fire, At þe mount of Synay bi olde dawe, Þar god him ?af þe firste lawe? Al on fire þe bush was, And ibrent noþing it nas: Þere shewede god his grete miht And himself in þat ilke sihte. Þat bush bitokneþ vre leuedi, Hire clene maiden-hed witerli; For hit was euere iliche clene, [Ne] mihtte hit noht be wemmed ene. Hete of flesh ne mihte hire wemme, No more þan þe bush mihte brenne. And many anoþer him iseih And wid [him] spak, þat was him neih, But noht alone in his godhede, Ac i-meind wid þe manhede; For, sikerliche i telle þe, Man ne sauh neuere his deite Bodiliche on eorþe her, He mihte noht, it is so cler. And, if þu wolt witen hou, Herkne, i wole þe telle now; For so heih a þing is þe god-hede, Þer-of to speke it is drede. God is so clene and so cler a þing, Þat heuene and erþe he ?eueþ shining, And sunne and mone and sterren breme, Off him þeih han al here leme. Þu sext, man, wel aperteliche, Þat þe sunne haþ brihtnesse muche, And, þouh he sitte so wonder heie, Hit greueþ euere mannes ei?e, Inwardliche on hire to se For hire grete clerte. Nu, for-soþe i telle þe— And sikerliche lef þu me— Þat god, þat ?af þe sunne his liht, Is swich an hundred [siþe] so briht. Man, mihte hit euere þanne be, Þat bodilich ei?e mihte him se Here on eorþe,—þe godhede? Nay, noman mihte don þat dede: Þat is preued and ishewed Boþe to lered and to lewed. Þanne maitou þenke: ‘Hu mai þis be? Ne shal no man god ise?’ ?us, ?us, bi my leaute! Herkne, and i wole telle þe: ?if þu wolt sen in þi siht God of heuene, þat is so briht,— Vnderstond nu what i mene— ‘Þu most ben of herte clene,’ In word, in dede, and in þouht, Þat þu ne be ifiled noht; For god self seide in soþ[e]nesse— Þe godspel þerof bereþ witnesse: Beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi deum uidebunt.Þis is to seie, i telle þe: ‘Þe clene of herte, blessed þeih be;’ For, at þe heie dom sikerliche ‘Þeih sholen se god’ aperteliche, In his godhede and in his blisse, Off which þeih sholen neuere misse. Þanne sholen þeih here, herkne nouþe, A blisful word of godes mouþe, [Which shal not be to hem vncowþe, For god shal sey it with his mowþe: Venite, benedicti patris mei.]‘Comeþ, mine blessede fere, Þat my fader beþ leue and dere! In-to my blisse ?e sholen wende, Þat lasteþ euere wid-outen ende, And euere more þer to wone Wid þe fader, and wid þe sone, And wid þe holi gost in vnite, Þat is þe holi trinite.’ ‘And [?e], cursede gostes, goþ anon, Þat sholen ben dampned euerichon!’ Þere hij sholen him sen also, Ac al shal ben for here wo; For toward hem he wole turne Boþe wraþful and eke sterne, And namlich to þat cumpaignye Þat slowen him þurw enuie, And kene nailes driuen ek Þurw his honden and his fet, And þere þeih sholen se soþliche, His grisli wounden openliche, Þat þeih deden hemselue make. For drede hij sholen þanne quake; Þanne wole god to hem seie Wid sterne voiz and wid heie: ‘Corsede gostes, ?e beþ me loþe! Goþ anon, goþ nu, goþe In-to þe stronge fyr of helle, Euere more þer to dwelle, And brenne þer in hote fyr! ?e seruede non oþer her: Merci is al fro ?ou gon, For whij on me hadde ?e non!’ He þat nele no merci haue Off him þat doþ him merci craue, He shal ben iuged, witerli, Rihtfulliche wid-oute merci. Sein Daui seiþ, if þu wolt loke In a vers of þe sauter boke: Spera in domino, et fac bonitatem.‘Hope to god, and do god,’ Riht so i hit vnderstod; Ac ydel hope man mai habbe— I sey þe soþ wid-outen gabbe— For alone to hope, widoute goddede, Is ydel hope, so god me rede. Ac i ne seie noht forþi, Þouh man be charged, sikerli Wid grete sinnes heuie and sore, He ne shal despeire neuere þe more, Ac soþfast hope haue, to winne Godes merci of his sinne Þurw shrifte of mouþe and repentaunce, And redi þerfore to don penaunce. ?if þu dost þus, bi day and niht, Put al þin hope in god almiht, And tristi hope to him þu haue, Þat he þe wole helpe and saue. Herkne, what i wole seie nouþe, For hit com out of godes mouþe: Vbi te in-benio, ibi te iudicabo.‘Man, riht þere as i þe finde, Riht þere i wole þe iuge and binde.’ Allas, what sholen hij þanne do, Þat beþ ifounde in sorwe and wo, Þat wolde noht hemselue shriue, While þeih mihte in here liue! Þerfore, man, i warne þe: Loke, þat þu þe bise, Þat þu be euere redi and ?are Out of þis world for to fare; For siker noman wite ne may, Whanne shal ben his ending day. Þerfore þenk ofte in drede Off þis word, þat god seide: ‘Þere i þe finde, i wole þe binde:’ Lat ofte þat word ben in þi mynde! Man, if þu wolt þe world forsake, And Iesu Crist to þe take, Þu most ben ofte in orisoun And in reding of lesczoun. De Scripturarum Lectione. Wid us god spekeþ, whan we rede Off him and of his goddede, And we wid him, ful iwis, Whan we him bisekeþ þat riht is. Holi writ is oure myrour, In whom we sen al vre socour, And, if we hit wolen vnderstonde, Þer we muwen sen and fonge, To haue of god þe knowelache, Boþe in þouht[e] and in speche. And, if þu wolt haue þe loue Off god, þat is in heuen aboue, Þu most ben euere in god acord, In pes and loue, and hate descord, De Præceptis Pucis. And ben aboute wid al þi miht, To make pes bi day and niht; For Iesu Crist hit seiþ ful wel, As we hit finden in godspel: Beati pacifici, quoniam filii Dei uo-cabuntur. A soþ word hit is and no les: ‘Iblessed be þat makeþ pes:’ Hij ouhten to ben honured alle, For ‘godes children men shal hem calle.’ Man, if þu wolt to me herkny, De Misericordia. Nu i wole speken of merci. Soþ[e]liche, wid-oute fable, Man, þu most ben merciable. On Iesu Crist þenk witerli, Hou he deiede for merci, And al for he wolde merci haue Off hem þat wolde merci craue; For, ar he deiede in flesh and bon, Merci was þer neuere non. Bi þis ensaumple ?e muwen se, Merciable for to be. ?if þi neiheboure misdoþ þe, More or lasse wheiþer hit be, Or in dede, or in vbbreid, Or wid word þe haþ misseid, And he þer-after of-þinkeþ sore And þer-of crieþ merci and ore, For-?if hit him for godes loue, Þat us alle sit aboue! And, if þu wolt no merci haue Off him þat doþ þe merci craue, Merci getestu neuere non Off trespas, þat þu hast idon; For god it seiþ in his godspel— Þere men may finde it ful wel— ‘Alswich met as þu metest me, Alswich i wole mete to þe.’ [For-?eue, þou man, for þe loue of me, De Indulgentia. And I wyll for þe loue of þe.] Nym god ?eme, man. Þu sist In þi paternoster, what þu bist: Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos etc.Þu seist: ‘Swete lord, for?iue þu me, Þat i haue gilt a?eines þe, Riht as i do alle þo, Þat me hauen ouht misdo.’ And þu, þat art so cruwel in þouht And wolt to merci herkne noht, What wole hit [þe] helpe in eny stede Þe holi paternoster bede? Noht, if i dar it seie, For a?ein þiself[e] þu dost preie, And þe holi bok of soþ[e]nesse Þer-of bereþ god witnesse And seiþ: ‘He þat wole no merci haue, On ydel doþ he merci craue.’ In patientia bestra possidebitis animas bestras.Houre swete lord in his speche Hise deciples began to teche De Patientia And bad hem ben of god suffraunce In alle manere destourbaunce. ?if þu art sek in flesh and blod, Þu most ben meke and þolemod And þenk[e] þat god it þe sende, Þi seli soule to amende. ?if þu hast lore of þi catel, Biþenk þe þanne swiþe wel, Þat of þi-self[e] haddestu noht, But as hit was þurw god iwrouht; And, if god it wole from þe take, Þu ne shalt þerfore no gruching make, Ac suffre al godes wille Boþe lude and eke stille. And, ?if þe falleþ trauail on honde, Or pine of bodi, or shame in londe, Off al þis þu most suffraunt be, Þouh þe þinke, hit greue þe. Þenk hou Iesu in-to erþe cam, And þolede pine and shame for man, And foule was þerto misseid, And many a skorn on him leid, Wid-oute gruching he held him stille, And þolede hit al wid milde wille, And al he dede for vre sake, For we sholde ensaumple take To be suffraunt in eueri stede, Riht as vre lord himselue dede. And, ?if a man þurw his power Doþ þe wrong on eorþe her, Þenk in þin herte, i preie þe, Off þe wrong and þe vilte, Þat men to Iesu Crist dede Here on eorþe in many stede, And hou he þolede hit mildeliche, Al ffor þi loue, sikerliche. On ensaumple of him þu nim, To suffre wrong for þe loue of him; For, i dar seie soþ[e]liche, He may be martyr, treweliche, Wid-oute sheding of mannes blod, Þat may ben here þolemod, To suffre wrong and vnriht For þe loue of god almiht: Ac swich a fiht is vnmeþ, For a?ein þe kinde hit geþ. Whij? for þe kinde of þi manhede Wolde haue wreche of wrongful dede; Ac of Iesu tak þi minde, And fiht a?ein þin owen kinde, And þu shalt haue for þi goddede Off martyrdom þe heie mede. Ac þu, fersse man, þat art so stout, And heih of mod, and herte proud— He wole bowe for noþing To man, ne to heuene king— And he þat wole him heinen here, Þat nele be meke in none manere, In litel while he shal hit knowe De Humilitate. And falle þerfore swiþe lowe. Qui se exaltat, humiliabitur, et qui se humiliat, exaltabitur.Þe milde þurw [her] humilite Ful heie honoured þeih sholen be; For þeih sholen be drawen on heih And wonye god swiþe neih. And pride, it is so foul a last, Þat out of heuene he was cast. Þu shalt wel wite, þat i ne li?e, For Lucifer [with] his cumpaignye, [Out of heuen, þat was so bry?te, In-to helle for pride he toke his fly?te.] Þurw þe pride þat hem gan folewe, Þe pine of helle hem gan to swolewe, And so he wole don alle and some, Þat in pride be inome. [Nowe be þou were, þou proude gome, Þat þou ne be in pryde enome:] Cast hit awey, i wole þe rede, Er of strong pine þe may drede; For siker, and þu be nomen þerinne, Heuene maitou neuere winne, And oþer weye is þer non, Bute to heuene or to helle gon. Þanne do bi consail and bi red, And ouercome þe foule qued, Þat fondeþ þe on vch a side, Þe to holde in þi pride. Ac, if þu couþest knowe and se Þe uertu of humilite, For noþing þu noldest shone, Ac hit sholde euere wid þe wone: Off alle uertuz it is hext, And godes wille it is next. Sein Gregory þerof bereþ witnes, Þat muchel spekeþ of soþ[e]nes: Qui sine humilitate uirtutes ceteras congregat, est quasi, qui in bento puluerem portat. Man, þou[h] þu do muchel god, But þou be meke and þolemod, Sein Gregory seiþ, þat holi clerk, Þat muchel on ydel is þat werk. Hit fareþ bi swiche, as we finde, As who-so bereþ poudre in grete winde; For, bere he neuere so muche, Hit fleþ awey ful lihtliche. Off man hit fareþ riht so, For, gode dedes þouh he do, Many and fele in vch a side, Þer may non wid him abide: Bute he haue humilite, Awey þeih wolen fro him fle. A god þing is humilite: Off him comeþ verray charite, And penaunce, and eke shrift— De Compunctione cordis. Þis is of god a wel fair ?ift— And of him for?if[e]nesse of sinne. Wel is him þat hit may winne! Who-so is aferd of his trespaz, He shal haue comfort and solaz Off þe holi gost, witerli, Þat wole [his] soule comforti, And make men haue, mid iwisse, Tristi hope to heuene blisse. Sein Daui þer-of spak and seide In þe sauter, as men rede: Secundum multitudinem dolorum meorum in corde meo, consolationes tuæ lætificauerunt animam meam.‘[Þe] more man douteþ here sinne, Þe more ioye he shal winne;’ For, who-so haþ of sinne drede And nel noht don þat foule dede, Hit semeþ, þat he haþ trewe loue To Iesu Crist, þat is aboue. O þing is comen in my þou[h]t, To shewe hit wole i spare noht: ?if any þat is in holy lyf, Man, maiden, oþer wif, In any time, þurw any cas, Doþ a litel trespas, Þat be a?ein godes wille, Oþer loud[e] oþer stille, He wole haue more sorwe and drede For þat litel sinful dede, Þan many on wole in eny stounde, Þat lyþ in dedli sinne bounde. ?if ?e wolen wite herof þe skile, Herkne, and i ?ou telle wole: Þat man þat lyþ in dedli sinne, And to singy wole noht blinne, Gostli wit he haþ ilore. Whi, i wole telle, [and] wharfore; For gostli siht, witerliche, Man, is þi resoun, sikerliche, Wher-þur[w] þu miht in þi mod Knowe boþe yuel and god, And shed to make in eueri dede Bitwene soþnesse and falshede. And, whan mannes soule, ful iwis, Þurw dedli sinne ifiled is, His knowelaching is al gon; For wit ne siht haþ [he] non, Wherfore þe sinful man Noþer he ne may ne he ne can His owen stat [a]riht ise, Ne knowe in what lyf he be For þisternesse, þat he is inne Þurw þe filþe of dedli sinne. Ac he þat liueþ in holy lyf, Man, mayden, oþer wyf, And serueþ god on eorþe her, His gostli siht is swiþe cler; For þerwid he may knowe and se— In what lyf[e] þat he be— God and yuel, lasse and more, Al he knoweþ þurw godes lore; For widinne him is god almiht And ?eueþ him grace of gostly siht To sen and knowe in his mod Þe longe lyff, þat is so god, And þe drede of domes-day, And þe pine þat lasteþ ay, Wher-þurw hij sholen þe more drede And flen sinne in al here dede. Here ?e muwen se þe wrong And knowe, wher-on [hit] is long, Þat sinful man may noht se Hise giltes, þou[h] þeih grete be. Listneþ nouþe to my speche, And of nedful þing i wole ?ou teche. Off holi churche it is þe lore, Þat spekeþ to alle, lasse and more, And seiþ: ‘Man, while þu miht liue, Loke þat þu be ofte shriue.’ De Confessions. Anon, so þu hast sinne wrouht, While it is newe in þi þouht, Anon to shrifte þat þu gange, Ne dwelle þu noht þerwid to longe; For, if þu dost, þu miht wel wite, Þat sumwhat shal be for?ete, Wher-þurw þu miht be blamed, And at þe dom sore ashamed. Þerfore, man, while þu miht liue, Loke, þat þu be [clene] shriue, Wid sorwe of herte and repentaunce, And of þe prest tak þi penaunce. Þis is a riche medicine, Hit shildeþ man fro helle pine. A betre þing was neuere founde,— For hit may hele dedli wounde— And, who-so euere wole hit craue, Wid-outen cost he may hit haue. Man, ne lat hit for no shame, Last þu falle þerfore in blame. If þu nilt for shame [shewe] hit her, Hit shal ben shewed elle[s]wher To alle þe shaftes þat euere were, And alle þeih sholen sen and here. Nihil absconditum, quod non scietur, nec occultum, quod non reueletur,And þer-of þu shalt haue shame And þer-to wel muche blame. Tweye manere shame men fint in boke, Who-so wole þerafter loke: Þat on goþ to dampnacioun; Þat oþer, to sauuacioun. ?if ?e wole wite hou hit be, Sitteþ stille, and herkneþ me: Man, þouh þu haue sinne wrouht In word, in dede, and in þouht, If þu art þiself þerof ashamed, And at þin herte sore agramed, And ne sparest for shame ne for ei?e, Þat þu hit nilt in shrifte seie, Off god þu miht wel lihtliche For?ifnesse haue, sikerliche. Þis ilke shame, be my croun, Draweþ al to sauuacioun. Þat oþer shame so is þis: ?if a man haþ don amis And foule sinne[s] haþ iwrouht, And wole for shame shewe hem noht In his shrifte to þe prest, He wraþþeþ sore Iesu Crist. For-?ifnes, iwis, ne tit him neuere, But in helle to brennen euere. Whi artu more ashamed to speke A word, þan godes heste to breke? Þis is foule, wicked shame, Þat bringeþ sinful man in blame. Þe lore þat comeþ out of godes mouþ, To alle men hit sholde be couþ: Lauamini, et mundi estote. De Pamitentia.Iesu spak and seide ene: ‘Wassheþ ou, and beþ clene.’ Kindeliche ofte men seþ, Wid water men wassheþ, þat foule beþ, And hot water, be þu bold, Makeþ clannere þan doþ cold. Al þis i seie sikerliche, For to speken openliche, What hit is for to mene: ‘Wassheþ ou, and beþ clene.’ Summe wassheþ, ac noht ariht, For þe clannere beþ hij no wiht. Þe hote teres of mannes ei?e Makeþ clannere þan any li?e. Many on wepeþ for his misdede, Ac to do sinne noht hij ne drede: He weneþ, wasshe him wid þat water, And he is foul neuere þe later. Whij? For ?it wole he noht sinne fle: Iwis, vnclene he shal be. Ac anoþer manere wasshing Makeþ clene of alle þing: Man, þouh þou hane sinne don, Lodlich and foule many on, ?if þu hast wille to leue þi sinne, Þat þu no more ne come þerinne, Of þin ei?en þe hote teres, Þat goþ adoun bi þine leres, Hij wolen make god acord Bitwene þi soule and oure lord And make þe clene of þi sinne, Wher-þurw þu miht heuene winne. Nu ?e muwe witen, what it is to mene: ‘Wassheþ ou, and beþ clene;’ Ac he þat wole clene be, Certes [synne] he mot fle. Wole ?e here ?it eft sone Off þing þat nedful is to done; Hit is godes owen lore, De non Tardando Couverti ad Dominum. Þat spekeþ to alle, lasse and more: Ambulate, dum lucem habetis, ne tenebræ bos comprehendant.‘Go, man, while þat þu hast liht, Lest þe of-take þe derke niht.’ Þi lyf, man, is cleped liht, And þi deþ þe derke niht. While þu art on liue, þu miht worche Godes werkes of holi churche, And, certes, whan þat þu art ded, Þanne maitou don noþer god ne qued. Þerfore, man, i warne þe, While þu miht gon and se, In gode weyes sped þe faste! Lef, þe niht þe wole agaste, And sikerliche widoute nay, At þi dei[i]ng shal ben þi domesday, For þere shal ben irekened al Þat euere distu, gret and smal. Þere þu shalt knowe and se God or yuel, wheiþer it be, And þanne, par aunter, wo[lde]stu fain Biginne to worche and turne a?ein; Ac, certes, þu ne shalt noht go, Ac riht after þu hast do, Þu shalt fonge verreement Þare þi rihte iugement. Et ideo ambulate, dum lucem habetis.Deþ is gilour swiþe strong And gileþ many on euere among, Þerfore worch, while þu mait, For sodeyneliche þu miht be caiht. Initium sapientiæ, timor domini: De Timore Domini.‘Drede of god in alle þing Off wisdom is þe biginning;’ And many hauen of god drede, Ac noht for loue of his godhede, But last þeih sholde for here gilt In-to strong pine ben ipult. Hit fareþ bi swiche, i vnderstonde, As hit doþ here bi þe bonde: Þe bonde nele noþer loude ne stille Don noht a?ein his lordes wille— Ac þat nis for loue ne for acord, Þat he haþ toward his lord— For, if he dede, he wot wel, He sholde lese of his catel; And ?it hit fareþ bi man also, Þat spareþ more sinne to [do] For þe doute of gret pining, Þan for þe loue of heuen king. It is noht euel so to biginne, For drede of pine to late þi sinne, For sone after he may kacche grace To biþenke him on godes face, Hu murie hit were, to haue þe siht Off godes face, þat is so briht! And so he shal casten his loue To Iesu Crist, þat is aboue, And leten and flen sinful dede, Boþe for loue and eke for drede. Ac, who-so wole don be my lore, Iwis he shal spare more, To flen sinne day and niht, For drede to lese þat faire siht Off godes face, þat is so cler, Off whom we han al oure power, Þan for drede of any wo, Þat any þing mihte hem do. Leue frend, herkne to me, And more i wole speke to þe; De Eleemosynis. For in þe godspel i wole rede Off þe uertu of almesdede. Þin almesse þu shalt forþ puite, And spare hit noht, þouh hit be luite: [In þe godspel it es write, I sal, man, þat þou it wite.] God seiþ þus in his lore: ‘Man, if þu miht ?eue no more But a dishful of cold water, Þu shalt hit ?eue neuere þe later Wid gode wille and wid charite, And ful wel it worþ ?olden þe.’ And, whan þu shalt haue þank and mede For so litel an almesdede, Siker maitou þanne be, If þu ?euest muche in charite To god, þu miht þe betre spede, And þe more shal ben þi mede. Enes i it vnderstod, Þat in almesdede is double god: It fordoþ sinne, wite it wel, And hit wole eche þi eatel. And, if þu art her-of in drede, Hu hit mihte so be in dede, A god witnesse i wole drawe, On ensaumple of þe olde lawe. Holi writ, þat wole noht li?e, Spekeþ of þe profete Eli?e, Hou Iesu Crist, houre lo[ue]rd swete, Spak to Eli?e þe profete. To a pore widewe he him sende, Here beyþere lyf [for] to amende. He seide: ‘Eli?e, þu shalt fare In-to Sarepte and wone þare. Þer is a widewe, þat shal þe fede, And i wole ?elde wel hire mede.’ Þe profete Helie began anon Forþ in his weie for to gon. At þe ?ate of þe cite þe widewe he mette, And faire anon he hire grette. He bad hire for godes loue, Þat us alle sit aboue, A di[sh]ful water she sholde him ?iue, For to helpen him to liue. Þe widewe seide, she wolde fain, And to serue him she turne a?e[i]n. After hire he gan to crie, And bad hire þat she sholde hie. ‘Do,’ he seide, ‘be my red, Bring me wid þe a shiue bred!’ Þe widewe him answere[de] anon: ‘Siker,’ she seide, ‘bred haue i non, Ne noht, þat i mihte þe ?iue, For to helpe þe to liue, But an handful mele in o picher And a litel oyle, þat is cler, Þat i mot make of mete here To me and to my children ifere; And seþþe we moten deie in sore, For mete haue we no more.’ Þe profete hire answerede þo: ‘Abid,’ he seide, ‘er þu go! First, þer-of mak me mete, And, whan þat i hit haue iete, Off þat bileueþ, þu shalt make For þe and for þi children sake.’ Þis seli widewe þo wel sone Grauntede wel al his bone: For his loue, þat him þider sende, Hire litel mete she wolde spende. Þo þe profete þis iseih, His ei?en he kest to god on heih: To him he made an orysoun, And anon god putte his fuisoun Vp-on hire mele in hire picher And on hire oyle, þat is cler. Þo seide anon þe profete To þe widewe wordes swete: ‘Ne dred þe noht, womman, in þi þouht! Þi mele ne shal wante noht, And þin oyle shal waxen: sikerli Þi lome shal noht ben empti.’ Gret plente hadde þe widewe þo, While she liuede euere mo. Now þu miht knowe in þi mod, Þat in almesse dede is double god: Almesdede for[doþe þi synne], And þer-þur[w] [men may heuen wyn[ne]]; And þi god sh[al multiplie], So seiþ þe bok, [þat nyl nau?t lye]. Þe godspel sei[þe to þe and me]: ‘?if and men sha[l ?efe þe].’ In anoþer stede, [I haue wytnesse], Þat god self se[ide] [in soþenesse]: ‘Al þat þu dost [for loue of me] To þe leste of m[yn meyne], Riht to my-sel[fe, wete it wele], Þu dost þi pres[ent euery dele].’ Glad maitou [be þan in þi þou?t], Also ofte as þ[ou mayt? ?eue ou?t], For, þu miht [wele vnderstande], Þu takest hit [gode with þi honde]; For godes w[orde in soþenesse] Þer-of bereþ [gude wyttnes]: ‘A man [may] b[e nou?t to quede], Iesu Crist for to [fede];’ For þer-wid þu [my?t wele spede] And heuene h[aue vnto þi mede]. To þa[t] blisse [he] [vs bryng], Þat is king [ouer all[e] þyng], And ?eue us [grace, while we be here], [To serue hym and hys moder dere In trowþe, loue, and in charite. Amen. Amen. So mot it be.]</field>
