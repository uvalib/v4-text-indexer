Two birds within one nest; Two hearts within one breast; Two spirits in one fair Firm league of love and prayer, Together bound for aye, together blest. An ear that waits to catch A hand upon the latch; A step that hastens its sweet rest to win, A world of care without, A world of strife shut out, A world of love shut in. THE SUMMER ROSES. (Imitated from the old German song, âRÃ¶schen auf der Haide,â in Herder's Collection.) Roses, roses, summer roses, Shall I pluck you from the thorn? Shall I leave you there till through you Autumn breezes rustling, strew you On the earth forlorn, Roses, summer roses? Answered then the summer roses, âHe who plucks the rose will find, As his grasp upon it closes, That the thorn is left behind: Through its sharpness still must sweetness Of the rose be brought to mind, Roses, summer roses!â So I plucked the summer roses, And the cruel thorn I met; Soon the sweetness of the roses Made me all its wound forget; But the roses, oh, the roses Bloom and breathe around me yet, Roses, summer roses! IMITATED FROM THE TROUBADOUR SORDEL. Her words, methinks, were cold and few; We parted coldly; yet, Quick-turning after that adieu, How kind a glance I met! A look that was not meant for me, Yet sweeter for surprise, As if her soul took leave to be One moment in her eyes: Now tell me, tell me, gentle friends, Oh, which shall I believe, Her eyes, her eyes that bid me hope, Her words that bid me grieve? Her words, methinks, were few and cold: What matter! Now I trust, Kind eyes, unto your tale half-told, Ye speak because ye must! Too oft will heavy laws constrain The lips, compelled to bear A message false; too often fain To speak but what they dare; Full oft will words, will smiles betray, But tears are always true; Looks ever mean the thing they say: Kind eyes, I trust to you! Her looks were kindâoh, gentle eyes, Love trusts you! Still he sends By you his questions, his replies, He knows you for his friends. Oh, gentle, gentle eyes, by Love So trusted, and so true To Love, ye could not if ye would Deceive, I trust to you! THE SINGER. From a ProvenÃ§al Poem of the Ninth Century. How thick the grasses spring In May! how sweetly ring The woods with song of many birds! the note That is of all most sweet, Most varied, most complete, Comes from a little bird of slender throat, The Nightingale, that sings Through all the night, and flings Upon the wood's dark breast her sweet lament. What! little bird, dost seek To conquer with thy beak The lyre's full ringing chords? be well content: A Minstrel to thy song Long listened, lingering long; A Prince a moment paused upon his way: âSweet, sweet!â they said, and then Passed onwards, while again Broke from the topmost bough thy thrilling lay. What! thinkest thou to chain The world? thou dost but strain Thy slender throat, forgetful of its need, Thou carest but to sing: Yet who is found to bring, To stay thy want, a berry or a seed? They praise thy song, and yet They pass thee, and forget; None feedeth thee save He who gave thy strain. Oh! why wilt thou prolong Thy sweet, thy mournful song, Unwearied, while the world to sleep is fain! When summer comes, unstirred Are all the leaves, the bird Is silent, while her callow young are tended. When Winter comes, the leaves Fall off, and no one grieves; The singer dies, her little song is ended! November, 1862. FOUR SONGS. Set to Music by the Author. TO L. A. C. Oh, hast thou won my heart, my love! What gain to thee? what gain? It plights thee with no golden ring, It decks thee with no chain; A simple thing, yet it will bring To thee, my love, no pain; To give thee rest, to make thee blest It hath been ever fain, my love, It hath been ever fain! Oh, have I won thy heart, my love? What gain to me! what gain! What brooding calm, what soothing balm, What sweet release from pain! Through sudden rest my spirit guessed What hour to me it came, And day by day I mark its stay Through comfort of the same, my love, Through comfort of the same! TO MARIA IVANOVNA. If dark be she I love, or fair, I ask not now; I do not seek With her the lily to compare, To find the rose upon her cheek. Such flowers as these grow everywhere; With all things soft, and dusk, and rare I liken her; the woodbine feels And finds her way with touches light; She keeps her hold with tendrils slight. How close, how kind the woodbine steals! The summer air is warm with bliss All stolen from the woodbine's kiss. Sit thou by me when eve has stilled And soothed the day's quick pulse to rest; Let none be near us while we build Within each other's hearts a nest, Of joys that fade, of youth that flies, Of love that stays, of memories That pass not with the passing day: Sit thou by me; be sad, be gay, So sweet thy smiles, so sweet thy sighs, So soft thy clasp, so kind thine eyes. Be what thou wilt, 'tis ever best; Be what thou art, and I am blest! IF IT BE PLEASANT TO REMEMBER THEE. If it be pleasant to remember thee, What is it, then, what is it to forget thee? But for a space, one moment's space to be As though I ne'er had loved, or known, or met thee? My soaring soul on some high quest to send, On some stern task to bind my strength's endeavour, Then, like the bird, with rapid wing descend Upon the nest that is my own for ever. By some sweet song, by some dear dream to be Upon my lonely way entranced, o'ertaken; Awhile, awhile to cease to think of thee, Then in the sweetness of thy soul to waken! Sweet dream, with day pass not away, As once in hours when all my joys were fleeter; Dear haunting lay, I bid thee stay, And in my heart for evermore grow sweeter. If still to bear thee in my mind be sweet, What is it then, what is it then to lose thee? In play with life to let the moments cheat My steadfast heart that flies again to choose thee? Afar, I see thee lift thy soul in prayer, I see thee in thy quiet ways abiding; Oh, sweet to me hath grown the common air, To me, for whom the Rose of life is hiding! I SPAN BESIDE OUR CABIN DOOR. (Adapted from an ancient Irish Song.) I span beside our cabin door, I watched him slowly cross the moor, I smiled as I will smile no more, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! How many an evening as I sat, With father he would come to chat, He came for this, he came for that, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! I watched him o'er the moor so wide, He took the path that turned aside I went within the house and cried, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! I saw him pass our cabin door; The world is wide, he came no more; I wept as I will weep no more, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! I drew my wheel beside the fire, I span as if I span for hire, My father talked, and did not tire, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! My heart is weary and my head, And all is done, and all is said, And yet it is not time for bed, Eskadil, mavourneen slawn! A SONG. [Kiss me before I sleep] (Set to music by Mrs. Tom Taylor.) Kiss me before I sleep, Oh gentle child, oh loving child! that so My spirit, ere it sinks within the wide Dim world of shrouded dreams, unsatisfied, And seeking ever, unto Thine may grow, Nor stir, nor move, nor wander to and fro; Kiss me before I sleep! Kiss me before I wake, Oh loving child, oh child beloved, that so The sweetness of thy soul, thy smile, thine eyes, May meet my spirit on its way to take The chill from off this life of ours, and make A world more kind and warm wherein to rise; Kiss me before I wake! AMID CHANGE, UNCHANGING. The Poet singeth like the bird that sitteth by the rose, While dews are chill, and on the hill the first faint sunbeam glows; While through the buds' thick-folded green the first red rose-streak shows, Sing, Poet, sing of Hope and Spring, Still sing beside thy rose! The Poet singeth like the bird that sitteth by the rose, While on the golden summer noon her golden heart o'erflows; And now she waxeth red, now pale, yet ever is the rose, Sing, Poet, sooth of love and youth, Still sing beside thy rose! The Poet singeth like the bird that sitteth by the rose, When from the drooping stalk her brief sweet glory earthward goes, And the red is kindling on the leaf that fadeth from the rose, Sing, Poet, sing, remembering, Still sing beside thy rose! ONE FLOWER. âFarewell, my flowers,â I said, The sweet Rose as I passed Blushed to its core, its last Warm tear the Lily shed, The Violet hid its head Among its leaves, and sighed. âOh thou, my flower, my pride, Sweet Summer's sweetest bride, The rest are fair, but dear Art thou, hast thou no tear, What givest thou?â âThe whole,â The glowing Pink replied, âBlush, tear, and smile, and sigh I gave In giving thee my soul.â âThe summer, wandering by, Hath breathed in thee her sigh, Hath wooed thee from the South, With kisses of her mouth; Hath wooed thee from the West, Hath blest thee with the best Warm blessings of the sun; And yet a heavy dower Is thine, my joy, my flower, Thy soul hath burst its sheath, Oh, is it love or death, Sweet flower, that thou hast won? Oh, is it love or death That breathes from this thy breath, That kindles in thine eye?â Then won I for reply, âI have made sweet mine hour; As dies the flower, I die, I lived as lives the flower.â A SCHERZO. (A Shy Person's Wishes.) With the wasp at the innermost heart of a peach, On a sunny wall out of tip-toe reach, With the trout in the darkest summer pool, With the fern-seed clinging behind its cool Smooth frond, in the chink of an aged tree, In the woodbine's horn with the drunken bee, With the mouse in its nest in a furrow old, With the chrysalis wrapt in its gauzy fold; With things that are hidden, and safe, and bold, With things that are timid, and shy, and free, Wishing to be; With the nut in its shell, with the seed in its pod, With the corn as it sprouts in the kindly clod, Far down where the secret of beauty shows In the bulb of the tulip, before it blows; With things that are rooted, and firm, and deep, Quiet to lie, and dreamless to sleep; With things that are chainless, and tameless, and proud, With the fire in the jagged thunder-cloud, With the wind in its sleep, with the wind in its waking, With the drops that go to the rainbow's making, Wishing to be with the light leaves shaking, Or stones on some desolate highway breaking; Far up on the hills, where no foot surprises The dew as it falls, or the dust as it rises; To be couched with the beast in its torrid lair, Or drifting on ice with the polar bear, With the weaver at work at his quiet loom; Anywhere, anywhere, out of this room! RAPTURE. Light at the full of the harvest moon, Heart of the rose in the heart of June, Song of the bird when its song takes wing, Breath of the blossomed furze in spring, Kiss of the angel that comes when dreams Are more sweet than all sweetness that is or seems, Fire in the cloud of the opal burning, Fall of a footstep at eve returning, Clasp of a hand that thrills to the soul, Bliss of a spirit that wins its goal! A SONG. [A little cloud that hung, my love] A little cloud that hung, my love, So low 'twixt earth and sky, Too sad it seemed for earth, from Heaven Afar, yet ever nigh; And oft it longed on Earth's warm breast To fall in kindly rain, And oft, on morn or evening's crest To leave a crimson stain; Yet fell not, rose not, till a bright, Keen arrow pierced it through, All fleecy thin, all milky white, All golden clear it grew; What could it do but fade, my love, And melt into the blue? A little wind that hid, my love, Beside the water's edge, And shook a music unforbid From out the withered sedge, And whistled o'er the dreary moor, And round the barren hill, And sighed at many a fastened door And darkened window-sill, And through the forest whirled and swept, When leaves fall wearily, And o'er the lake's cold bosom crept, And moaned beside the sea, Until between the sea and sky It found a quiet cave, All lined with mosses soft and dry, Afar it heard the sea-bird's cry, Afar the restless wave; What could it do but die, my love? What could it do but die? THE BRIDGE. NOON. We lingered on the rustic bridge, We saw the pebbles in the stream Below us, clear in amber light Of noonday, flash and gleam; Afar, the yellow flag-flowers caught A glory from the flitting beam, And all was still and fair, methought, And golden as a dream. Oh, might this hour not pass away! Oh, were it given to us, not lent! And might we, framed within it, stay, A breathing picture of content! And hear the babbling waters run, And hear the distant stock-dove coo, And dream that in the world were none But only I and you! A PICTURE. It was in autumn that I met Her whom I love; the sunflowers bold Stood up like guards around her set, And all the air with mignonette Was warm within the garden old; Beside her feet the marigold Glowed star-like, and the sweet-pea sent A sigh to follow as she went Slowly adown the terrace;âthere I saw thee, oh my love! and thou wert fair. She stood in the full noonday, unafraid, As one beloved of sunlight; for awhile She leant upon the timeworn balustrade; The white clematis wooed her, and the clove Hung all its burning heart upon her smile; And on her cheek and in her eyes was love; And on her lips that, like an opening rose, Seemed parting some sweet secret to disclose, The soul of all the summer lingered;âthere I saw thee, oh my love! and thou wert fair. THE SONG OF THE TROUBADOUR PIERRE RAYMOND DE TOULOUSE. âVergiers, ni flor, ni pratz, No m'an fait cantador, Mas per vos cui ador Domna, m'sui alegratz.â I know the woods in spring, I know The voices of the breeze and brook; I know the little flowers that look With starry eyes upturned, and grow Through all the rapture that the bird Flings down, with quiet hearts unstirred; The joy above, the calm below, The thrill that passes, and the slow, Sweet stealing silence, these I know. Yet more than these I know; the light Upon the passing moment thrown, That weights its bliss, yet wings its flight; The look that makes two hearts alone, Two spirits to each other known, And all the world's wide clamour thrown Afar, afar! Yes! all that dies And lives 'twixt loving lips and eyes Is known to me! and would ye deem I caught this music from the stream? Ye say my song is sweet; I know My song is sweet! Ye call me proud, A careless-hearted singer, slow To gather praises from the crowd. Yet praise me if ye will! in cold Set phrase, with others standing by. With gracious smile and voice unmoved, One told me once that she approved The strain I sang; my looks were shy, But from that hour my song grew bold; I saw her blush, I heard her sigh; Enough, enough, if so approved! Oh! softly as she spoke that word, What songs it woke within my breast! As when a warm wind from the west Shakes all the summer thicket stirred With breezy rapture and unrest: Of all that gives delight I sing, Of all that lightly comes and goes In bud and bloom and withering Of last year's flowers, of last year's snows; Of many a pleasant tale outworn I sing! of forest alleys green, And lovers underneath the thorn That met; of many a maid forlorn, And robber fierce, and wandering queen; Of knights upon a glorious quest, And lovely ladies, long ago Of each bold heart beloved the best, And near the hearts that loved them, low Long laid and lapped in quiet rest; I sing of banner and of crest, Of lifted lance, of ringing shield; I sing the tourney's mimic field, In crowded lists the shock, the stir, I sing of her, I sing of her! And if she loves me for my songs, Or if she loves my songs for me, I ask not! idle question wrongs Love's soul, from such vain surmise free. If first the Bulbul sings, who knows, Or first unfolds the crimson rose? The sweet bird sings, the sweet flower blows. She loves, she loves my songs and me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LATER POEMS. A FAREWELL TO YOUTH. A MIDSUMMER DAY'S DREAM. Thou fair and hurrying guest! O Youth, in tears half-drowned, And half with roses crowned! Thou sweetness unpossessed! I pine not for the sound Of thy swift wings, thy sighs, Thy whispers, nor thine eyes' Soft, silent language seek, that sent around So many a glance, caressing and caressed; Nor grieve I for thy song, Glad, sad, and sweet, so long Remembered, though its cadence broke so soon: A fond farewell, O Youth, I take of thee! thy truth Was sweet, and e'en thy falsehood scarce beguiled; For thou, thyself a child, Believing, hoping, loving, didst receive And give with equal hand, and sweetly keep And sweetly break thy troth, and wake and sleep In peace through every change, unchilled, ungrieved; Thy Waking and thy Dream So sweet, so close did seem, That thou wert blest, deceiving or deceived. And thou wouldst not remain To hear reproachings vain; A print upon the grass, a line between The rustling boughs of sudden-parted green, And thou wert gone for ever! Truly fled? I know not yet! methinks within my heart Thou hidest still thy bright unsheltered head, And dost remain, for evermore a part Of all things fair, and from the violet's eye Thy smile looks up, thy breath goes wandering by In many a wild, warm, briery-scented sigh, Linked with all lovely things that change and cannot die! So come and go, dear Youth, I will not chide with thee! for now the mist Hath rolled all up the glittering hills sun-kissed, And broad around me stretch the woods, the plains; And still the landscape widens, still the sky Bends over all with broad, unwinking eye, Above an equal blue, an equal green Below, and nought is hidden! all is seen And all is known! But now methinks the lanes Grow white and dusty, and no flower remains With brimming cup, no descant wild and shrill Of all that morn and eve were wont to thrill My listening ear; the reapers work in bands, But all is silent: where are now the hands That sought for mine, the dances light and free? The tales that seemed beginning still to be, And pausing woke again, and still were sweet to me? But now upon the clear Calm summer air, I hear, Far on the silence borne, a distant strain; A tune that gives and takes, That hushes while it wakes, That loosens while it binds a gentle chain: So sweetly on the sense It falls, I ask not whence It comes, nor know I whither goes that tune More soft than summer dewsâ Most like a hand that wooes An arrow forthâand while I listen, seems Far off and faint, like music heard in dreams, To change and fade each dim, half-shrouded pain; Each fond regret, each care Is fled;âoh, tell me where, Dear Shepherd, Thou dost feed Thy flocks at noon? Oh, tell me in what still Fair meadows at Thy will Thou leadest them? by what glad streamlet's flow? Perchance upon the rocks Thou sittest now, Thy flocks With reedy murmurs soothing, while the low Soft summer winds reply; or by the Well Thou sittest now, perchance, as once befell When Thou wert wearied with the noontide glare. Oh, long-belovÃ¨d, let me find Thee there, And there with Thee abide; the shadows soon Will fall and darken o'er these pathways wide; Oh, let me be no more as one aside That turns unwilling! by Thy tents I dwell, Thy dear companions know me! Shepherd, tell, Where dost Thou make Thy flocks to rest at noon? THE WHITE CRUSADEâITALY, 1860. âAnd the earth helped the woman.â âRev. xii. 16. Long, long the foot of pride Trode down the human heart from hour to hour With iron heel, and ever on the side Of tyrants there was power; Till, seventy summers back, A Cry went up by night to God for food; A raven's cry, a lion's, on the track Of rapine and of blood; And Freedom at the sound Stirred where she lay within her grave for dead, And rose up from the earth, and gazed around Like one disquieted. As one that hath been dead Four days, she rose up from her grave; she woke Fast bound with grave-clothes, hands, and feet, and head; Yet when she rose she spoke: Like Lazarus from the tomb She rose, and stood upright; like him a while She walked with men,âyet on her cheek no bloom, And on her lip no smile. As one that sleeping shakes Beneath a ghastly slumber-coil, will seem To wake at dead of night, yet only wakes Into a fearful dream; She woke into a world Of wreck and ruin; winds and waves that roared, Men's hearts that failed, and goodliest treasures hurled To monsters overboard. They called her, but she shrank; She stretched her hands to bless, and, lo! a stain Of blood upon each palm! She groaned, and sank Into her grave again. Yet 'mid the tumult fierce That gathered as she fell, was faintly heard From fainting lipsâa blessing or a curseâ And yet a treasured word;â And still from land to land The whisper grew, and still the murmur sped By look, by sign, by pressure of the hand, âThe maiden is not dead.â Till every heart that knew A stronger beat, that shook a looser chain, Caught up the word, until its meaning grew From hour to hour more plain. And some would watch for hours Beside her tomb, until they seemed to hear, Beneath the winter's ice, the summer's flowers, A breathing low and clear. The nations spake: âBut who Shall roll away this heavy stone, by day And night close sealed and watched?â They came, and lo! The stone was rolled away! And clothed in raiment white From head to feet, was seated on the stone A Shining Form, that earth had given to light Without a travail-groan. No blood on brow or palm, Or on her robe, but in her steadfast eye, And on her lips, a summons clear and calm: âWho loves, knows how to die.â The swords of friends and foes Are crossed before her breast; her breast is bare, And bare her feet, and on the way she goes Lies the red burning share. She wakes, perchance to show Of wounds received in houses of her friends,âto weep, Like Rachel, o'er her sons brought forth in woe, Yet never more to sleep! THE CLEFT. 1861. âHamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. âOh, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half.â The skies have voices soft And loud, they mutter oft, Dissolve and break in tears of joy and wonder; More fierce the shock, the din More harsh, when from within Earth shakes, self-torn, and riven with secret thunder; And now a ghastly cleft Yawns wide from right to left, And sucks and draws the Western World within it; What voice, what arm uplift This dire encroaching rift May close with sovereign spell? and how begin it? In such a gulf of old The Roman flung, not gold, But Youth's heroic hope and Strength's endeavour; Yet this one of the best Hath ta'en, and for the rest Still craves, unclosed, insatiate, widening ever. Say, will ye smoothe it over, And bid the maid and lover Dance here away their light-linked hours of leisure? Yea, smoothe it over, sow it With grass and flowers; below it Are sounds that mingle strangely with the measure. Or, leaning o'er its edges, Now will ye barter pledges With clasping hands, and talk of hearts combining, Or plant the rootless tree Within itâLiberty, Hung round with garlands and with ribbons shining? The jagged cleft from side To side yawns yet more wide; And Echo from within, your words recalling, Hath sent from out the ground The yet more hollow sound Of loosened earth upon a coffin falling. Then let it yawn to sever The Bond and Free for ever: Than Falsehood's hectic flush of vain relying, On Freedom's cheek more fair The glow of health, though there Across it broad and deep a scar be lying! Yea, let the sword pierce through This tangle, and undo The knot that doth but harder twist for friction: Oh, seek not now to bind What God hath loosed! no kind Espousals these, but fettered, galled constriction. When life meets life with kiss Of rapture strong, oh! this Is union, this is strength; then leave the dying With Death their troth to plight, In charnel vaults by night, 'Mid dead men's bones and all uncleanness lying. There leave them! let the wide, Deep chasm still divide 'Twixt Night and Day, 'twixt Light and Darkness,âknow That greater than the whole Is now the part; the soul Is nobler than the body,âlet them go! THE SATURDAY REVIEW. âLearn to live, and live and learn,â In the days when I used to go to school, Would always pass for an excellent rule; But now it's grown a serious concern The number of things I've had to unlearn Since first I began the page to turn Of The Saturday Review. For once (I believe) I believed in truth And love, and the hundred foolish things One sees in one's dreams and believes in one's youthâ In Angels with curls, and in Angels with wings, In Saints, and Heroes, and Shepherds too; The pictures that David and Virgil drew So sweetly, I thought were taken From very life, but now I find A Shepherd is but an uncouth Hind, Songless, soulless, from time out of mind, Who has cared for nothing but bacon. And though to confess it may well seem strange, When I had them by scores and dozens (I was young, to be sure, and all things change), I really have liked my cousins, And schoolfellows too, and can bring to mind Some uncles of mine who were truly kind, And aunts who were far from crusty; And even my country neighbours too Didn't seem by half such a tedious crew As now I find they must be. And I used to think it might be kind, In the world's great marching order, To help the poor stragglers left behind, Halt and maimed, and broken and blind, On their way to a distant border; Not to speak of the virtuous poor, I thought There was here and there a sinner Might be mended a little, though not of the sort One would think of asking to dinner. But now I find that no one believes In Ragged Children, or Penitent Thieves, Or Homeless Homes, but a few Old Maids Who have tried and failed at all other trades, And who take to these things for recreation In their aimless life's dull Long Vacation. And so as we're going along with the Priest And Levite (the roads are more dry in the East) We need have no hesitation, When the mud is lying about so thick, To scatter a little and let it stick To the coat of the Good Samaritan, used To be spattered, battered, blackened, and bruised; These sort of people don't mind it the leastâ Why, bless you, it's their vocation! Yet sometimes I've thought it a little strange,â When good people get such very hard change, In return for their kindly halfpence, When the few who are grieved for sorrows and sins Are bowled to the earth like wooden pins, When to care for the heathen, or pity the slave, Sets a man down for fool or knave, With The Saturday in its sapience,â Things that are mean and base and low Are checked by never a word or blow; The gaping crowds that go in hope To see Blondin slip from the cruel rope Tightened or slack, and come away In trust of more luck another day, Meet never a line's reproving; Heenan and Sayers may pound and thwack Each other blue and yellow and black, And only get a pat on the back From the power that keeps all moving. And I sometimes think, if this same Review, And the world a little longer too Should last, will the violets come out blue? Will the rose be red, and will lovers woo In the foolish way that they used to do? Will doves in the summer woodlands coo, And the nightingales mourn without asking leave? Will the lark have an instinct left to cleave The sunny air with her song and her wing?â Perhaps we may move to abolish spring; And now that we've grown so hard to please, We may think that we're bored by the grass and the trees; The moon may be proved a piece of cheese, Or an operatic delusion. Fathers and Mothers may have to go, Brothers and Sisters be voted slow, Christmas a tax that one's forced to pay, And Heaven itself but an out-of-the-way Old-fashioned place that has had its day, That one wouldn't a residence choose in. And though so easily learnt, and brief Is the form our new faith's put in, When we've said, âI believe in a Round of Beef, And live by a Leg of Mutton,â We come to another region of facts, That are met quite as well by the Gospel and Acts As by any teaching that's newerâ Life has its problems hard to clear, And its knots too stiff to be cut by the sneer Of the sharpest, smartest Reviewer. October, 1863. A DIALOGUE. IN 1863. âWell, what news have you got to-day, neighbour?â âWhy, the Prince is going to be wed To the Princess Royal of Denmark.â âAy, so I hear it is said, And she'll be a grand young lady, there's no doubt at all; but you see I never set eyes on the Prince in my life, and he knows nought about me.â âAnd what other news have you got, neighbour?â âOh terrible news: abroad The great Garibaldi's taken and wounded.â âWas he some Lord Or King? But I know so little of these people beyond the sea, They seem to be always fighting, it's a pity they cannot agree.â âWhy, then, if you come to fighting, the Yankees are at it still, As hard as ever they were at the first.â âWell, they must then, if they will. I suppose they're a sort of cousins of ours; but then they're so very far Removed, that it doesn't much matter to us how long they go on with the war.â âNow there you are out for once, neighbour, for it's neither more nor less Than their keeping up of this war so long that's causing our great distress. They've given up growing their cotton, and sending us any to spin, And that's the way things keep going wrong, you see, when once they begin. âYou're not a reader like me, neighbour, or you wouldn't soon forget The things that they tell in the papers; my word, but they're sharply set In Lancashire now; and it's my belief, that if things don't soon work through They'll be taking to dying off pretty fast, if they've nothing else left them to do. âWhy now, how would you like it, neighbour? I think you would look rather blank If you hadn't a shilling left in the house, nor a guinea left in the Bank, If first you'd to part with your silver watch, and then with your handsome clock, And then with your quilt, and blankets, and bed, till at last you came to the stock! âUntil when you looked about your room there was nothing to see at all But just a table, perhaps, and a chair, and the roof and the floor and the wall. And how would you like to sell your best black coat that you've worn so long? Or your wife to have to go out and pawn her good Sunday cloak for a song?â âI shouldn't like it at all, neighbour; and as to my wife, why she Would take on, perhaps, if all were known, a great deal worse than me.â âAnd then when there's nothing to do, you see, there's always so little to eat; And only think of the children, neighbour, how they must be missing their meat! âNow there's that curly Jem of yours, that likes nothing he gets so well As what he gets with his granny and you, as I've heard you so often tell, That just when you're sitting down to your meat he's sure to come peeping in, You wouldn't like it so well, neighbour, to see him growing thin.â âI shouldn't like it at all, neighbour, I tell you, but where's the good Of talking when folks are starving? sure I'd help them if I could.â âWell, there's nothing so easy as that, neighbour, you haven't got far to sendâ It's only like taking a bit of your dinner across to an ailing friend.â âWhy, not quite so easy as that, neighbour, for if things are as bad as you say, It's little to better them that we can do by giving them once in a way.â âWell, giving them once in a way perhaps would come rather short; but then There is nothing to stop us, that I can see, from giving them once and again.â âWhy that's very pretty talk, neighbour, but then to be always giving Doesn't come quite so easy to folks like us that have to work hard for our living.â âWell, as to the matter of that, neighbour, if we haven't got much to spare There'll just be the less to send, but still we may always have something to share. âWe might all of us give far more than we do, without being a bit the worse; It was never yet loving that emptied the heart, or giving that emptied the purse. We must be like the woman our Saviour praised, and do but the best we can.â âAy, that'll be just the plan, neighbour, that'll be just the plan.â A SONG TO CALL TO REMEMBRANCE. A Plea for the Coventry Ribbon-Weavers. I heard a little maiden sing, âWhat can the matter beâ? A simple song, a merry song, yet sad it seemed to me, âOh, my love is coming from the town, he is coming from the Fair, And he will bring me ribbons blue to tie my bonny hair!â O lasses fair, that love to wearâO lads, that love to see The ribbons bright, the ribbons rareâwhat can the matter be? At Christmas tide, when all beside are merry and are glad, How many English hearts are sore, how many homes are sad! The looms are stopped, the hands are still that wrought the ribbons gay; When anxious fathers have no work the children dare not play; No cheerful noise around the board; oh! little to prepare! The mother's work is quickly o'er, but not the mother's care! And all is dull and all is chill within the humble room; Beside his black and fireless hearth, beside his idle loom, The poor man sits from day to day in garments worn and thin, And sees the homely comforts go he toiled so hard to win. The icicle hangs on the eaves, and silent as a stone All Nature lies in sleep or death, chilled through unto the bone; The earth below is white and cold, the skies are cold and grey, The grave seems very near, and Heaven seems very far away. Oh sad and short the wintry day, oh sad and long the night, When in the heart there is no hope, and in the house no light, No fire, no food! yet goodly gifts, yet words of Christian cheer, Can make the grave seem farther off, can make the heavens more near. Ye merry hearts, that meet to laugh and dance the hours away, Ye gentle hearts, that better love in sheltered homes to pray, Think on the homes whose Christmas guests are only Want and Care, Think on the hearts too sad for mirth, too sad perchance for prayer; For Want and Care are dreary mates, and where they enter in There Love should follow after quick, for Discontent and Sin Without the door are knocking loudâoh! keep them waiting there, And hold at bay the prowling wolf of savage, gaunt despair! A little while and skies will clear that now are overcast; Our ship that rides 'mid heavy seas will right itself at last; Come, loving hearts, come, open hands, with bounty warm and wide, Come, lend our struggling friends a lift, till the turning of the tide. January 10, 1861. A NATIONAL SONG. Of flowers that bloom in gardens fair, that bloom in meadows free, I had my choice of all that blow, and I chose me only three; But I must have them all or none! the first one that I chose Was Queen of all the flowers that be, the red, the royal Rose! The Rose that blooms upon the rock, and lets the salt sea-spray Drift over her, nor asks if this be anger or be play; She bows not down her stately head for any breeze that blows, She smiles in kindness on her friends, in pride upon her foes. A lion watches by her root, and all her gallant stem Is set with thorns, ah, woe betide the hand that touches them! But deep within the rose's heart, in many a silken fold Wrapt round, a costly treasure lies of fragrance and of gold. Then lone and free, on hill and lea, unguarded yet unharmed, All green I saw the Thistle grow that groweth ready armed, She flings her arrowy seeds afar to thrive where'er they fall, Oh grasp the hardy thistle close, or grasp her not at all! Oh love the thistle well, for she will love thee to the end, For scorching sun she will not droop, for storm she will not bend; How fair upon the thistle's head her purple-tasselled crown, And oh! within the thistle's heart, how soft and warm the down! Yet must I farther on to seek a flower that loves the West; I only found a little leaf, with mystic signs imprest; âHast thou no flower?â I sadly said, âand hast thou nought to show But this thy high and heavenward hope, but this thy patient woeâ? âYet saints have loved thee, fairies danced across thee at thy birth, And thine are gifts that suit with joy, and gifts that suit with mirth; Shine on, green leaf, to kindly Trust, to Wit, to Valour dear, And still let Erin's smile be ours, though smiling through a tear.â Of flowers that bloom in gardens fair, that blow in meadows free, Now have I had my choice of all, and I have chosen three; I would not live, I would not die, I would not sing for one, I love them all so well that I must have them all or none! A CHRISTMAS CAROL. 1863. If ye would hear the Angels sing âPeace on earth and mercy mild,â Think of Him who was once a child, On Christmas-Day in the morning. If ye would hear the Angels sing, Christians! see ye let each door Stand wider than ever it stood before, On Christmas-Day in the morning. Rise, and open wide the door; Christians, rise! the world is wide, And many there be that stand outside, Yet Christmas comes in the morning. If ye would hear the Angels sing, Rise and spread your Christmas fare; 'Tis merrier still the more that share, On Christmas-Day in the morning. Rise, and bake your Christmas bread: Christians rise! the world is bare, And bleak, and dark with want and care, Yet Christmas comes in the morning. If ye would hear the Angels sing, Rise and light your Christmas fire; And see that ye pile the logs still higher, On Christmas-Day in the morning. Rise, and light your Christmas fire; Christians, rise! the world is old, And Time is weary, and worn, and cold, Yet Christmas comes in the morning. If ye would hear the Angels sing, Rise and spice your wassail bowl With warmth for body, and heart, and soul, On Christmas-Day in the morning. Spice it warm, and spice it strong, Christians, rise! the world is grey, And rough is the road, and short is the day, Yet Christmas comes in the morning. If ye would hear the Angels sing, Christians! think on Him who died; Think of your Lord, the Crucified, On Christmas-Day in the morning. GO AND COME. Thou sayest to us, âGo, And work while it is called to-day; the sun Is high in heaven, the harvest but begun; Can hands oft raised in prayer, can hearts that know The beat of Mine through love and pain be slow To soothe and strengthen?â still Thou sayest âGo; Lift up your eyes and see where now the Line Of God hath fallen for you, one with Mine Your Lot and Portion. Go, where none relieves, Where no one pities, thrust the sickle in And reap and bind, where toil and want and sin Are standing white, for here My harvests grow: Go, glean for Me 'mid wasted frames outworn, 'Mid souls uncheered, uncared for; hearts forlorn, With care and grief acquainted long, unknown To earthly friend, of Heaven unmindful grown; In homes where no one loves, where none believes, For here I gather in my goodly sheaves;â Thou sayest to us, âGo.â Thou sayest to us, âGo To conflict and to death;â while friends are few And foes are many, what hast Thou to do With peace, Thou Son of Peace? A man of war Art Thou from Youth! when Thou dost girded ride, Two stern instructors, Truth and Mercy, guide Thy hand to things of terror; friends and foes Thine arrows feel; a sword before Thee goes, And after Thee a fire, confusion stirred Among the nations even by the word Of Meekness and of Right; âYea, take and eat Of these my words,â Thou sayest, âthey are sweet As honey; yet this roll that now I press Upon your lips will turn to bitterness When ye shall speak its message; lo, a cry Of wrath and madness, ere the ancient Lie That wraps the roots of earth will quit its hold, A shriek, a wrench abhorred; and yet be bold, Oh, ye my servants! take my rod and stand Before the King, nor fear if in your hand It seem unto a serpent's form to grow; Rise up, my Priests! my Mighty Men, with sound Of solemn trumpet, walk this city round, A blast will come from God, His word and will Through hail, and storm, and ruin, to fulfil; Then shall ye see the Towers roll down, the Wall Built up with blood, and tears, and tortures, fall, And from the Living Grave the living Dead Will rise, as from their sleep disquieted; O Earth, this Baptism of thine is slow! Not dews from morning's womb, not gentle rains That drop all night can wash away thy stains.â The fire must fall from Heaven; the blood must flow All round the Altar;ââstill Thou sayest, âGo.â And that Thou sayest, âGo,â Our hearts are glad; for he is still Thy friend And best beloved of all, Whom Thou dost send The farthest from Thee; this Thy servants know; Oh, send by whom Thou wilt, for they are blest Who go Thine errands! Not upon Thy breast We learn Thy secrets! Long beside Thy tomb We wept, and lingered in the Garden's gloom; And oft we sought Thee in Thy House of Prayer And in the Desert, yet Thou wert not there; But as we journeyed sadly through a place Obscure and mean, we lighted on the trace Of Thy fresh footprints, and a whisper clear Fell on our spirits,âThou Thyself wert near; And from Thy servants' hearts Thy name adored Brake forth in fire; we said, âIt is the Lord.â Our eyes were no more holden; on Thy face We looked, and it was comely; full of grace, And fair Thy lips; we held Thee by the feet, We listened to Thy voice, and it was sweet, And sweet the silence of our spirits; dumb All other voices in the world that be The while Thou saidest, âCome ye unto Me,â The while Thou saidest, âCome.â We said to Thee, âAbide With us, the Night draws on apace;â but, lo! The cloud received Thee, parted from our side, In blessing parted from us! Even so The Heaven of Heavens must still receive Thee! dark And moonless skies bend o'er us as we row, No stars appear, and sore against our bark The current sets; yet nearer grows the Shore Where we shall see Thee standing, never more To bid us leave Thee! though Thy Realm is wide, And mansions many, never from Thy side Thou sendest us again; by springs serene Thou guidest us, and now to battle keen We follow Thee, yet still, in peace or war, Thou leadest us. Oh, not to sun or star Thou sendest us, but sayest, âCome to Me; And where I am, there shall My servants be.â Thou sayest to us, âCome.â A SONG WHICH NONE BUT THE REDEEMED CAN SING. We came not in with broad Full canvas swelling to a steady breeze, With pennons flying fair, with coffers stored; For long against the wind, 'mid heavy seas, With cordage strained and splintered masts, we drave; And o'er our decks had dashed the bitter wave, And lightening oft our lading, life to save, Our costly ventures to the Deep were given. Yea! some of us were caught, and homewards driven Upon the storm-wind's wings, and some rock-riven Among the treacherous reefs at anchor flung, Felt the good ship break under them, and clung Still to some plank or fragment of its frame Amid the roaring breakersâYet we came. We came not in with proud, Firm, martial footstep in a measured tread Slow pacing to the crash of music loud; No gorgeous trophies went before, no crowd Of captives followed us with drooping head, No shining laurel sceptred us, nor crowned, Nor with its leaf our glittering lances bound; This looks not like a Triumph, then they said. With faces darkened in the battle flame, With banners faded from their early pride, Through wind, and sun, and showers of bleaching rain, Yet red in all our garments, doubly dyed, With many a wound upon us, many a stain, We came with steps that falteredâYet we came! Through water and through fire We came to Thee, and not through these alone, We came to Thee by blood! Thou didst require One only sacrifice, and like Thine Own, The life Thou gavest us Thou didst desire, And all was ready for us! Lo, the knife And cloven wood were waiting; bound or free We too were ready! In the battle strife Or by the lonely altar, unto Thee We offered love for love, and life for life; Through swords, through seas, o'er sands of burning flame We came to Thee! through toil and pain and loss; Yea! all things failed us but the steadfast cross, And hearts that clave to it while grief and shame Still followed where we followedâYet we came!</field>
