      <field name="fulltext">THE AVTHOR TO THE READER. Of Syon if thou be, good friend I greete thee well, If not, God furnish thee in better hope to dwell. Some paynes here haue I spent, the papistes to perswade, His treason to repent, and take a better trade. If not I bring him newes, that hanging is his hire, Which scarsly will excuse, the tormentes of hell fire. For such as haue regard, of God and Gods elect, This pamphlet is preparde, although not finely deckt. I way not what is sayd, for want of wit or skill, Ne am I much afraid, though workemanship be ill. The tidings yet are true, and trueth is worth the penne: The blame that may ensue, is but from Balish men. But duetie driues me forth, the cause conuenient, Though labour little worth, the learned to content. Yet this my silly quill, though voyd of Poets Art, Doth offer my good will, accept it in good part: My purpose doth pretend, the power and prayse of God, And how he doth extend, his mercy and his rod. His Rodd to punish those, that practise wicked wayes, His mercy to disclose, the same to his great prayse. Whereby the iust are taught, their manners for to mende: And trayterous Papistes brought, to their deserued end. This is the summe and fine, of my vnlearned tale, The iust will not repine, at this my emptie male: But rather helpe to fill, the same with better stuffe: That schollers of more skill, may put the like in proofe. A: N. The Booke to the Reader. Loe I am sent, but vnto whome God knowes: Mine aucthor ment, this message to inclose. Within his chest, as he doth many moe: But at the request, of friendes abroad I goe. I must be seene, I know of manie eyes: If I had bene, but pend amongest the wise, Then most men might, with liking lend me eare: Though some would spight, the message that I beare, To whome in deede, mine aucthor wild me say: I pray thee read, and beare it well away. Though liking small, yet leaue me for the rest: That haply shall, haue me in more request, The learned sorte, may finde simplicitie: Though other sporte, at this my poetrie. The godly minde, will see and search the worke, And if he finde, the faultes that therein lurke, He will amend, the matter with good will. And eke defend, the aucthors purpose still. The rest I craue, to reade and rightly iudge, And let me haue, free passage without grudge, As messenger that meanes but to bewray: The massacre, of murthering Papistes praye. Which seene and viewd, by loyall subiectes eye: Loe I conclude, with farewell by and by. A warning to all trayterous Papists. Come forth ye Papistes and confesse, that God is iust and true Come on I say and see the proofe, now practised on you. Ye nations all that neighbours are, be witnesse to the same: That God hath broke their brasen walles, all glory to his name. What eye so dimme, or darke by age, or blinde by natures arte: That hath not seene by sondry showes, how God hath playd his part. In loue he hath relieu'de his Church, by tyrauntes long opprest, And therein plaste his Debora, and this our country blest. Whose staggering state full oft did stand, on topp of treasons towre: From whence was brought the batterie, that should her life deuour, What meanes were made for to impeache, her maiesties good name: UUhat shifts to shed her guiltlesse bloud, by shauelinges voyd of shame, That if our God had not begonne, his Scepter forth to show: His Church and Children had bene spilde, and this our Prince also, who maugre Saule, and Doegs drifte, hath Dauid set on throne: By whom his Church hath liu'd in peace, yeares twentie sixe and one, with blessinges more aboundantly, then can with toong be tolde: which christian countries can report, and you your selues beholde. But Sathan neuer satisfitd, his malice to aduaunce: Hath practised conspiracies, from Rome, from Spaine and Fraunce, Yea and at home, with houshold mates, whose feete her courts did tread: whome she aduaunst to dignities, with whome she brake her bread. Not onely rayling Semei, that churlishly could chide: But Absolon for to vsurpe, the kingdome in his pride. And to destroy his father deare, whome he had kept with care, Such counsell could Achitophell, that popish priest prepare: But God the guide of Princely thrones, his purpose could preuent, who hath appointed prudencie, in this her gouernment, with Salomon for to discerne, the flie from forged arte, with Samson eke the Lyons iawes, to teare and pull apart. For God hath made your mosseled mouthes, your secrets forth to show, Your owne vile handes your heartes bereaue, of life and breath also, Can iudgement ioynd with iustice then, be made a fortunes wheele: Hath God no worke in this your wracke, which iustly now ye feele. Awake ye momish Madianites, and heare your fellowes dreame: The barley loafe must bruse your tentes, for Gedeon rules this realm, The harloc Rahab was resolu'de, that God would his defend: But you are growne so impudent, your mallice hath no end. Like Rabsack the Assirian, ye thinke your sword must cut: That by your strength ye may pull downe, that God hath builded vp. But would ye haue your purpose sped, then runne the ready way: Achior Holophernes tolde, what should be our decay. Send Sathan with obliuion, to lay our heartes abroad, That God for our ingratitude, may let her feele your sword. But otherwise reproche is yours, as alwayes it hath bene: For God will his annoynted keepe, from trayterous handes vncleane. Will no man teach you whence Kings are, nor wherfore they are sent: Let Peter be your patron then, and yeeld your selues content. Giue honour to the King sayth he, as to the ruler chiefe: Sent for the safetie of the good, but for the wickeds griefe. Thapostle Paule could this alleadge, when Festus was in place: I haue committed naught sayth he, against law nor Cæsars grace. If thou wilt prooue Gods minister, pleade so for thy defence: If not, as traytour take thy leaue, for all thy proud pretence. We must not still be blest like babes, with bottles full of blis: But teache vs in the booke of God, what subiectes duetie is. And eke what Princes in their place, of subiectes ought to haue, What fayth, what feare, what Cæsar may of duetie duely craue. Ioyne not with Iewish Iesuits, theyr godly Prince to spoyle: Remember that thy Bishopricke, ought beare no trayterous broyle. Seduce not subiectes from their due, but loyall let them bee: And deale with doctrine faythfully, as best becommeth thee. Thapostles were not leaft as Lordes, goe looke what Christ doth say, Much lesse for to depose a Prince, if Dauid liu'de this day. He would pronounce thy punishment, and thus his sentence bring: The man shall dye that dare lay hand, on Gods annointed King. But you pronounce a pardon playne, and great reward also, In this life and the life to come, that thereabout shall goe. And prayers make for present helpe, but vnto whome I doubt, Not God I know, but Sathan must your purpose bring about. But how you prosper with the same, let heauen and earth take view, How God doth wrestle with your worke, who is a iudge most true. will Balam bluntly beate his Asse, though God withstand his way, will Ionas still to Tharsis flie, what euer God doth say. will Holophernes hard of heart, at no time vnderstand, whose force it is that doth defend poore Iudith from his hand, will foolish Pharaoh neuer finde, although he feele indeede: Iehouah still to fight for them, that are the faythfull seede. will shamelesse iudges neuer cease, to seeke Susannaes bloud, Till Daniell doe pronounce theyr doome, then stoning is to good, will Haman Mardocheus hang, on gallous at his gate, But Hesters prayers will be heard, himselfe shall hang thereat. O Balish Babilonian, and Balthazar by name. Let Daniell reade the kingdomes fall, and ruine of the same. For thou art wayed and found to light, thy kingdome must be rent. Lo, Chaiphas in thy byshhopricke, hath long bene resident. But God shall smite that paynted wall, who persecutes his flocke. And teare him from his triple throane, and breake him like a crocke. Who sitting on his regall seate, shall laugh his foes to scorne, By whome their names out of this booke, of lyfe shall quite be torne. Such are the iudgements of the Lorde, for them that shall dispise. His scepter and annoynted seate, by any enterprise. No Patriarke, no Pope, no Priest, nor vicar that may vaunt, Supremacie on sacred prince, but loyaltie to graunt. Of prince therefore no euill speake, no not in secret bed, For sure the birdes shall thee bewraie, when thou shalt shewe thy head. Although thy treasons tooke effect, in Gods appoynted time, By murthering of a vertuous prince, let not thy courage clime. Though God giue lothsome traytours leaue, our gratious prince to kil, Triumphe not thou as though thy strength, had wun the golden hill. But whensoeuer it shalbe, if God haue so decreed. It is not thou, no it is wee, through whome it doth proceed. And therefore brethren deere I pray, let heart and heades be ope. To craue of God to saue her grace, from this vngodly Pope. And that our sinnes may not deserue, so greeuous plagues to fall. That in his wrath he take away, his word our Prince and all, with watered eyes therefore behold, the euils of this age And with great care of conscience passe, through this our pilgrimage. Let eche man trie his pathes and steppes, least we should tread awry: Let all our workes be wrought in feare, for Sathan standeth by. who sifteth vs as in a searce, for suttle is his shift: That he may shake our feeble fayth, to this is all his drift. Then downe comes all that we haue done, our labour is but lost: Our coupling cannot holde togither, if he remoue that post. For if we falter in our fayth, what works can haue effect: As is our fayth, so followes workes, direct or indirect. Be not deceaued, see the fruites, corrupt are all our wayes: And there is no man that doth good, not one as Dauid sayes. we haue bene gadding after gaine, from God and his good lawes: But let vs turne againe to him, and eke confesse the cause O let vs runne and ring the bell, that hangeth by his eare: Yea ring it out and neuer cease, till mercy make him heare. Come let vs tumble out our teares, and on his feete them cast: That he may see our sorrowes great, and pitie haue at last. with bowed backes and broken heartes, prostrate before him fall, With sighings sent from sobbing brest, confesse our faultes withall. And pardon prayd for that is past, prepare vs to amend, This sayd, thus done, let papist proud, his treason still pretend. Our God shall giue them such a blow, vpon the hard cheeke bone: That all the world shall see and know, how God doth keepe his owne. And we shall sing with himnes and Psalmes, the prayses of his name: All Christians shall confesse and say, Amen vnto the same. The Prayer. O Lord our father deere, through thy beloued Sonne, Who els art but an vpright iudge, to geue vs dolefull doome. Thy seate is in the heauens, which man cannot conceaue. Contayning all thinges, not contaynd, whome time is faine to leaue, To whome all prayse is due, thy name most reuerent. Whose kingdome still must rayne and rule, thy purpose permanent. Beholde thy children poore, oppressed sore with sinne. The burthen greate, we cannot beare, the weight that is therin. Behold vs lothsome whelpes, to whome no bread is due, which we must needs confesse O Lord, to be both iust and true. we know it is not meete, that dogges deuoure the foode. Belonging to the childrens lotte, prepared for their good. But from the childrens board, maye fall some crummes which we. By thy good grace may gather vp, and so sustained bee. Shunne not this little fayth, though very small it prooue. But furnish it with feruencie, that it may neuer moue. Strength vs with sturdie hope, thy vesture but to tutche. Our blouddie issue may be stopt, that troubleth vs so much. Our leprosie likewise, Lord clense, and being cleane. We may returne with thankefulnes, that thanklesse long haue bene. Unworthy are our mouthes, thy worthy prayse to giue. But onely say the worde O Lord, and our sick soule shall liue. Our Palsie put a way, which would preuent thy grace. And say our sinnes forgiuen be, lo wee shall mend apace. For sinne is sure the cause, of thy displeasure sore. Till thou in mercy bid vs go, in peace, and sinne no more. Then may we haue acces, as children to beholde. The countnaunce of a father deere, and neuer be controlde. To whome with ioy we bring, thy Christ and with him craue. That our petition may be heard, and gracious graunt to haue, Our follies Lord forgiue, and pardon that is past: Repayre the ruine of our fayth, and stablish it at last. We do confesse O Lord, vnworthy wee haue bene. To reape so great a grace from thee, as is our gracious Queene. with whome so bounteously, thy blessings haue bene sent. Such as the nations round about, colde neuer yet frequent. Thy gospell giuen with peace, that in her heart shee brought. And in her hand the scepter held, whereby thy truth was taught. But grateles Gergesices, colde not embrace the same, But rather sent it from their coastes, for feare of losse or blame. For which thy threatned wrath, hath thondered in our eares. with signes and wonders that are past, and dayly yet appeeres. Amongst which threatnings straunge, this last is not the least. The likely losse of this our Queene, which threatneth our vnrest. In whome thou hast layd vp, our hope for happie daies. By whome thou dost defende thy Church, in peace to giue thee prayse. For which thy mercies greate, the malice of thy foes, with murthering mindes do marche aloft, thy scepter to depose. But thou hast broke the teeth, of eache vngodly one. Though in their wicked enterprise, thou let them long alone. Surueiw their vile deuice, let iordaine floud bee dryde. Hurle down the walles of Iericho, supplant them in their pride. Abash the brazen face, of Bayarde bolde and blinde, Let Holophernes feele the force, of Iudiths godly minde. Let Pharaoh finde and knowe, what fellow is the Lorde, Let all amazde Madians meete, with edge of Gedeons swore. Let Haman haue the doome, for Mardoche deuisde, shut vp the shameles mouth of him, that hath thy name despisde. Ty vp those Tyrants Lorde, Let Samson teare their iawes, Let Daniel deale with wicked Iudge, by lot of Godly lawes. O Let thy feeble flocke, haue such defence and ayde, That Atheisis, Papists and the rest, may see and be afrayde. We know O Lorde our God, our wretchednes is such, That we do more deserue thy rod, then mercy halfe so much. But for thine own names sake, drawe now thy sword and kill. Thy foes that fayne would Babel builde, on sacred Syon hill. Their cankered cruell hearts, doe gape for guiltles bloude. To suck it from her princely brest, that seekes to do them good. But we beholde O Lorde, thy holy helping hande, And doe perceiue thy passing powre, their purpose to withstande, Howe thou haste led them foarth in liew of their delight, Like howndes that looke for greedy game, their pray in present sight. But when their match was made, their mouths were muzled vp, Ne coulde they bite, nor skarsly barke, their chaps by thee were shut. Their tygrish harts turnde vp, for all their leaue and scope, To their reproche, but our releefe, and her assured hope, For which they maruellous might, we magnify thy name, Which haste in mercy made vs see, her safety to their shame. which seene can neuer sincke, out of the heartes of thine, But register and eke recorde, the same from time to time. Our broken hartes we bring, and bowed knees we bend, Beseeching thee in mercy still, her state and ours defend. O heare the humble sute, of ashes, earth, and dust, and helpe vs Lorde in time of neede, thou art our onely trust. Be guide vnto her grace, from feare of future foes, Deliuer her from dayly doubtes, that present daunger shoes. Conuert or else confounde, the troup of traytors all, Depaint them out in colours plaine, that they may faint and fall. And let her fearfull heart, feele comfort from thy throne, Aduauncing her with vertuous minde, to yeelde thee thankes alone. Prepare and plant her sure, in garden of thy grace, That she may growe to happy dayes, and health in heauenly place. And on thy children poore, such blessings Lorde bestowe, That they may haue thy holy worde and sacramentes also. And on this little land, cast downe thy carefull eye, Continue still thy wonted grace, and heare vs when we cry, And though we shall offend, yet doe not vs forsake, But when we come before thy throne, our prayers for to make. Then heare and helpe vs Lorde, according to thy worde, That we may say and sing aloud, Amen through Christ our Lorde.</field>
