      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONORABLE MRS. NORTON, AS AN HUMBLE TRIBUTE OF THE SINCEREST ADMIRATION FOR HER VARIED AND TRANSCENDENT TALENTS, AND AS A SLIGHT TOKEN OF REGARD, THIS LITTLE VOLUME IS DEDICATED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY SONNET. Accept this tribute, Queen of England's Lyre! And as thou read'st the weak, unworthy line, Bid thine own Genius round it brightly shine; Lend it, oh lend it some of thine own fire. Haply too much, too boldly I aspire, Thine all-surpassing name with name of mine Thus to attempt presumptuously to entwine; But some sweet dream of fame Song will inspire! Then let it be soâthen thus let it be, Oh thou! whom all extol, whom all admire, My little offering let me bring to thee; So an extraneous worth shall it acquire; O'ershadowed by thy proud bays waving freeâ Bright, gifted, beauteous Queen of England's Lyre! FAREWELL TO ENGLAND. 1833. Farewell, my Land! on thy blest shores I leave Many Beloved Ones!âshall I seek to weave A Song of warbled lamentations soft, For sighing breezes, towards those shores to waft A melancholy, plaintive, swan-like strain, Murmuring that like Death's pang is Parting's painâ Or leave it to these voiceless tears to shew All that can be revealed of jealous woe (Which still loves best in hidden streams to flow)â Or pour the fervent sorrows of my soul On one wild, sudden, full Farewell!âwhile roll Bravely beneath our bark, loud, fast, and free, Those waves that soon must sever us from thee, Beloved Country!âYet roll on, roll on, Ye blue, rejoicing waves!â'tis past, 'tis done! When my last footstep printed that loved shore, Was not the bitterness of parting o'er? Rollârollâimpetuous waves! that onwards bear Life's care-stained Wanderers!âye that know not care, Ye that in freedom of disdainful play Reflect, redouble all the pomps of day, And evermore become in joy and might The mirror of ten thousand worlds by nightâ Ah! only on your pure, transparent face, Of Heaven and Heavenly things ye keep the trace! No Earthly stain your glorious surface marsâ Clouds, sunbeams, meteors, lightnings, rainbows, starsâ The many-coloured mists that float and spread Around Light's throne and Sovereign Fountain-headâ The crimson, and the purple, and the gold, The Tempest's kingly banners, broad unrolled, With lurid blazonries on every fold; The Morning and the Evening's proud display Of dazzling wealth and prodigal arrayâ The glories and the terrors of the skies, Their varying lights, and ever-changing dyes, Their royal pomps and gorgeous mysteries, The endless wonders of the Firmamentâ These are the pageants that ye still present, These are the matchless spectacles and shows That ye display in turmoil and repose. On! bear us on! now let now hopes arise, To greet new shores and gild ev'n alien skies: No spot of Earth is there that may not bless The admonished Soul with chastened happiness; The Soul that, calmly free and humbly meek, Improvement, Knowledge, Wisdom, Truth would seek, Where'er its destined path may chance to lie, Beneath the all-o'ershadowing dome of sky: Not hitherâthitherâlike a thing astray, Wandering, unmapped, unbeaconed on its way; But with a rational aimâa governed will, A studied endâand settled purpose still. And with a calm and an established trust, A clear-couched view, unprejudiced and just, And with a solemn and a steadfast hope (Embracing more than Earth in its vast scope), And with the excitement of a blameless quest, A search for all that's noblestâfairestâbest, Bent to pursue its journeyings, far or near, Though not its own free course ordained to steer, Haplyâyet strengthened by such inborn cheer. So may it be with me!âyet let me prove, Where'er, 'midst Earth's all-various scenes I move, Still true to Memory, Gratitude, and Love. And therefore, true to thee, Oh! Island-home, Dear Country of the Cradle and the Tombâ Land of the inviolate shrine, the unshaken tower, The honoured hearthâthe sacred, social bower. England! sweet England! Fare thee well! Farewell! Thy cliffs in Heaven now lose themselvesâdispel Those clouds, dear Memoryâgathering dense and dim Round that loved shore. Now doth my fond eye swim, My fond heart swellâwhile looking thus my last On thee, my Country! where my chequered Past, With its ten thousand changes, flowedâhow fast! Where first were opened to mine eager view, Great Nature's pages, ever fresh and new; Where first my mind for Truth's pure fountains yearned, Where first my soul with deep emotions burned; Where, first and last, my heart was touched and moved, Where first and last it hoped, dreamed, trusted, loved! Where now I have left, as hostage for that heart, Its own best, dearest, and most intimate part! Yes! Land of Loveâof Childhood, and of Home! Thy cliffs do lose themselves in Heaven!âa gloom, A gorgeous gloom, seems gathering round thee now, And scarce to Love will Grief's last gaze allow. Pavilioned round by many clouds art thou, (That dim and gloomy to mine eyes appear, Because they bar those eyes from sight so dear!) Yet richly do those vapoury curtains wear A purple radianceâpure, and bright, and fair. Thy cliffs do lose themselves in Heavenâin Heavenâ For of their clear, sharp outlines, all bereaven, And of their proud proportions shorn and clipped, And of their bold, projecting features stripped, And of their massive semblance dispossessed, And robed in shadowy palliamentâthin vestâ And stained with faint, soft colourings, not their own, Pale hues, by widening distance o'er them thrown, And girdled round by many a vapoury belt, And many a cloud-wreath, do they seem to melt Into the smiling Firmaments above, And the soft atmosphere spread round in love. Ay! to my strained, tear-troubled eye, they seem, Ere yet they vanish like a beauteous dream, To mix and mingle with the crystal sky, (Until they form one aÃ«ry pageantry, One dreamy splendourâthus together blent, While so to each a lovelier charm is lent!) To grow ethereal, and to cast aside Their rugged massiveness and stubborn prideâ To fade and fleet from the desiring sight, But fadingâfleetingâsoftly to unite With yon serene, celestial Realms of Light. And thus, my heart-dear Country! thus, e'en thus, Within my thoughts, grown half-idolatrous, Thy loved and lofty memory doth outshine; By envious Distance made but more divine, By dark divorce made but more sacred there, By mournful Exile yet more blest and fair. Yes!âso thou seem'st, beloved and matchless Land! Mingling with all of glorious and of grand, Of brightâof beautifulâthat may be scanned By mortal eye, or mortal fancy evenâ Yes! England! thou becom'st thus one with Heaven. Almost I deem, within thy hallowed bound Nor care, nor pain, nor sorrow might be found; One mighty, magic circle, brightly free From earthly wrong and earthly misery. Is there one blessing that doth not abound In the free precincts of that thrice-bless'd ground?â Is there one virtue that doth not adorn That sacred soil (as there 'twas bred and born, Native to thee, as light and dew to morn?)â Is there one proud distinction that doth not Exalt and glorify that chosen spotâ One generous feeling that doth not expand In the pure bosom of that favoured Land? Oh! ever-free and happy England! prove The mighty magnet of my duteous love! Oh! ever prove, though seas and mountains part, The Land of Promise to my longing heart: For ever prove the haven and the goal, The centre round which all my thoughts may roll, The ever-beauteous Dream-land of my soul! And still new glories ceaselessly display, And o'er that soul exert increasing sway; And still new claims perpetually unfold To new devotionâdeeper than the old, Though that was all unmeasured and untold! So Love exalts the object he adores, So Love enriches with his priceless stores Whate'er he worshipsâwith true faith and zeal So doth he still bestowâand still reveal New charms, attractions, and enchantments there, That still surpass each otherâstill more fairâ More perfectâmore prevailingâand more rareâ (Until the soul, engrossed by that bless'd theme, Becomes one passionate, one adoring Dream.) So Love embalms the object he reveres, And Absence gildsâEstrangement but endearsâ Distance, delay, and difficulties make That object yet more cherished for their sake. 'Twas dear beforeâbut consecrated then; Fair alwaysâthen e'en dazzling to the ken; For ever preciousâbut then prized sevenfold, An hundredfold more dearly than of old! So Love adorns with his deep-working spells, That shrine where all his sumless treasure dwellsâ But Oh! sweet Land! of every charm possessed To arouse and animate the coldest breast, Doth Love require Imagination's aid To view thee in Perfection's guise arrayed? To dwell with zeal of homage, ever newâ With ardour of delightâwarm, quick, and trueâ On such a theme of Sovereign Excellenceâ No! No!âhis inspiration springs from thence, And Truth becomes the liveliest Eloquence. (Yet all the truth to express, would surely ask Gigantic powersâ't were a gigantic task!) Why Eloquenceâwhy Fancy seem but tame, When they would lend new lustre to thy name, And magnify thy Gloryâsound thy Fame; Enthusiasm itselfâdull, slack, inert, When 't would do homage to thy vast desert; All Love, all Admiration, and all Praise To thee belong, nor can adorn nor raise;â Palladium of the rights of all mankind!â What sacred treasures are in thee enshrined. Surely while thou dost flourish and endure, Humanity's best interests rest secureâ Peace, Justice, Honour, Temperance, Liberty, Fair Charity, and Independence high, Reverence and Virtue, Wisdom, Valour, Worth, Make thee the very Eden of the Earth. Doth not fair Plenty's cornucopia pour O'er thy glad fields the abundance of its storeâ Doth not sweet Quiet make her hallowed nest In thy calm bosom, where no storms molestâ Doth not bright Concord smilingly abide Where thy free towns and towers display their prideâ Doth not supreme Security remain Where thy proud oak trees lord it o'er the plain, And to triumphal arches shape and bend Their mighty boughs, that far and wide extend, And give fair promiseâwhich they yet shall keepâ That they shall lord it o'er the thundering deep? Yes! yes! Security for ever smiles, Where Heaven and Nature guard the Imperial Isles; Where thy dread Seas the' ambitious foe control, And round thy shores of smiling beauty roll; Where thy white cliffs in venerable pride Confirm the sentence of the briny tideâ That no Intruder on that sacred strand Shall dare, with rash, unlicensed foot, to stand. Lo! Earth and Heaven, and the confederate Sea, In concert cryââBe peaceful, and be free!â And free and peaceful may'st thou still remain, And prouder heights of palmy state attain. Oh! Ark and TempleâCitadel and Shrine, What marvelâtorn from Sanctuary like thine, That Love's full heart should deem it all divineâ What marvel, while we stretch the parting sail, That fond Devotion's tongue should trembling hail Thy fading shores, embracing with yon skies, As the' outskirts of an earthly Paradise! Well may the Wanderers, severed from thy breast, Proclaim thee, weepingâFairest, Firstâand Best! And still thy name exaltâthy worth attest. Well may it be, to them in their distress Pardoned, though they should worship to excess; Well may it be to them, indeed, forgiven, To deem their England almost one with Heaven! A SUNSET SCENE BETWEEN AUXERRE AND AVALON. Yon bare hill, brightened by the sun's last rays, How doth it now attract and chain the gaze! Erewhile, of no proud beauties 't was possessed, The wearied Traveller's wandering glance to' arrest; But now!âa Pyramid of golden fire, It doth outshine and triumph, and aspire. Its unadorned and rude and sterile brow (That ne'er felt sweeping scythe nor cleaving plough) In bright supremacy 'tis rearing nowâ A thousand splendours its huge bulk displays, And proudly its crowned front it seems to raise Above the' o'ershadowed plains. It hath become, While they lie round it, robed in solemn gloom, A wonder!âall one gloryâand its sides, Erst darksome as the flow of midnight tides, Might shame those streams that roll through gorgeous Lands, O'er beds of jewel-heaps, and gold-strewn sands. It smiles a challenge at yon dazzling skies, And with the sumptuous tracts of cloud-land vies; It shines like some pure globe of light, let down From yon most radiant Heavens, this earth to crown; For with such brilliance doth its surface glow, That scarce its shape can be distinguished now: It gleams a golden Paradiseâafar Heaved o'er the faint Horizon's delicate bar, Lovely and shining as a new-born star, Fair as the' Olympus of the fabled Jove;â Yet All it hath of bright is from above; All that it hath of Beautiful and Bright, Is borrowed lovelinessâreflected light. No heaps of glowing fruitâno beds of flowers, No emerald sheen of closely-clustering bowers; No coloured mossâno plumy-waving corn, Clothe its bare crags, its sterile sides adorn. No sparkling springs gush forth with gentle leap, And light their own way down its frowning steep; No vernal gifts from Nature's bounteous hand, Such as adorn this fair and favoured Land, Make beautiful that lone, uncultured Hillâ No! all it hath, yon bright sky lendeth still. Thus o'er a heart that's unenriched, unblessed By earthly treasuresâin a virtuous breast, Heaven doth delight to shed profusely down Its hallowed gifts, and make them all its ownâ Thus o'er a heart, devoid of earthly joy, Its golden treasuresâpureâwithout alloy,â Indulgent Heaven doth oft unsparing pour, And bless it with an unexhausted store. (The Poor in Spirit are the Rich indeed, When such their treasure is, and such their meed). Thereâthere that Heaven doth shed its purest grace, And there unveils the glory of its face;â Thereâthere is oft its chosen seat of seats, No hindranceâno obstruction there it meets; No evanescent blooms of smiling Hope, Born but to fade, and springing but to droopâ Of headstrong Passion no vain prodigal tares, No clustering growths of thick and choaking Cares; No rooted plants of stubborn Prejudice, No thorny shoots of bold and reckless Vice. By proud Prosperity encouraged so, That all beside, around them they outgrow. No poison-leaves of Envy, fell and direâ No towering stems of Pride (allowed to aspire Unpolled, unprunedâin triumph higher and higher)â No gaudy weeds of Pleasure unrestrained (Whose scanty honey's all too quickly drainedâ That shed their garish colourings lightly round)â Invade its lonely, consecrated bound. 'Tis open all to the awakening light, To the free day-beams in their joy and might; To the soft showers, and to the gracious dew, Such as these golden Eves unfailingly renew!â Revivifying, freshening, brightening all; A costly blessing wheresoe'er it fall. But oh! far richer, costlier dews are poured, O'er the pure Soul with but Heaven's treasures stored, Than e'er from Evening's hyacinth-tinted urn Were shed o'er blossomy boughs or feathering fernâ Deep dews of Lifeâfrom holiest source that spring, And promise, healing comfort with them bring. (That make the loneliest desert bloom and smile Like the glad face of some sweet sunny Isle)â Oh! from the secret treasury of the skies Are sent these dews, which no fierce noontide dries,â From Heaven these dews, those day-beams, and that shower; From Heaven the light, the glory, and the power;â Thence, only thence, doth brightly-issuing flow All the prosperity it boasts belowâ Heaven rushes full upon that unclaimed soul, Embraces, kindles, wakes and warms the whole. Then its bright riches, boundless and supreme, Surpass the doting Miser's wealthiest dream; Then its possessions and its gains transcend All Fortune can bestowâall Earth can lendâ Exhaustless, sumless affluence, without end! And Oh! fair Hill! its lot surpasseth thine, Since in unsetting Suns, it shall for ever shine! VINE-COVERED HILLS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. Beautiful Hills! ye're like some magic dream, While thus ye shine in Morning's purple beam; Not bareânot bleakâbut to your summits clad With gadding vinesâas though the fair Earth had In Mother-like solicitude sent these, Like gentle Emissaries, ev'n to seize And bind ye to her loving breast, methinks, With their soft ligatures and delicate linksâ So to remind ye, that though soaring high Into the bright, glad regions of the sky, Ye still are hersâand must to her belong, While Nature's everlasting laws stand strong; So to remind yeâev'n while thus ye lift Your kingly foreheads crowned with Morning's gift Of dazzling sunshineâover wood and plain, That still ye're hersâand still shall hers remain! For this, methinks, these delicate chains ye bear; For this, her verdurous livery brightly wear. For this, in many a light fantastic ring These tender Parasites about ye cling; For this, in mazy wreathings round ye twine These thousand-tendrilled Clamberers serpentine; Up-creeping to your summits from your base, And folding ye in soft yet strict embrace. Yes! ye are hers!âand bound by sternest ties (Howe'er ye may aspire to yon clear skies) To her maternal bosomâties that mock The lapse of yearsâeach elemental shockâ The roll of Seasonsâand the march of Fateâ Ties which disruption ne'er shall desecrate. Yours is a union nothing shall dissolve While duly on her axis she revolve; Cities shall be forgotten in their place; Huge forests fall, and leave no visible trace; But ye shall stand unshaken, and look down On Chance and Change with a reproving frown; And while ye last, ye still must hers remain; And if from her ye'd soarâye soar in vain! Deep your foundations in her heart are laid, Not to be loosened, weakened, nor decayed! Firmly your roots are in her centre cast, To last while Nature and herself shall last! Ruin, Mutation, they shall pass ye by, Till Time must melt into Eternity! Nor shall the thunderbolts of fiercest storms Cleave your unwedgeable frames and mountainous forms; But from your rocky-studded armour fall, Like weak darts from some adamantine wall. Is not your name the Everlasting Hillsâ And shall ye stoop like reeds, or shrink like rills? And shall ye fleet like transient shows away? No! ye shall scorn subversion and decay! Firmâindestructibleâshall ye abide In solid strength and in substantial pride! And yet, proud Hills!âev'n now to me ye seem, While thus ye shine in Morn's refulgent beam, No Earthly shapesâbut some Ethereal Dream! ON THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. 1 Oh! Mediterranean Sea!âoh! thou Mediterranean Sea! It is well with me that at last I look on thy loveliness and on thee. Oh! how placidly pure, and how beamingly bright do thy glittering waters seem, Like an hundred rivers of sapphire and gold, met together in some rich dream. 2 Now hail to thy brightnessâand hail to thy calm and thy heavenly heavenly hue, Oh! Glorious Mediterranean Sea, so beautiful and so blue. And hail to the fertile and flowery pride of thy winding and verdant shore, For never did Scene of Enchantments so rifeâgreet and gladden my senses before. 3 Oh! Mediterranean Sea!âOh! thou Mediterranean Sea! It is well with me thus, on thy golden shoreâon thy borders of beauty to be; Where gracefully spread the olive-trees into many a shadowing bower, And haughtily with their crested heads, the ambitious stone-pines tower. 4 Oh! thou Mediterranean Sea serene! Oh! thou Mediterranean Sea! 'Tis gently and lightly the breezes blow o'er thy dimpled glass in their glee, 'Tis a feast of sunshine makes ever glad thy surface and thy fair shore; Roll, roll, and rejoice! breathe music, flash light,â for ever and evermore. A SCENE NEAR NICE. A Scene of Beautyâthe close Olive-trees, That scarce let through the winged and vagrant breeze, Weave their pale silvery tapestries of light leaves, To doubly, triply-veiling foldsâscarce cleaves The day-beam through this thick entangled screen, So dim, so dense, so shadowy and so green. And where it doth, it must consent to wear A twilight softnessâworth its proudest glare When cloudless noon is most supreme and fair, That silvery tint of tenderest sheen it gains Which trembleth o'er those trembling leaves, that stains Its ruddy orient, clouds its golden hue, Abates its fiery flash, like moistening dew, And tempers its keen radianceâall too keen, For such a tenderly sequestered scene, And of its wanton joyousness beguiles, Like feeling harmonizing mirth's gay smiles! Sunshine seems witched to delicate moonlight here, Ethereal, soft, mild, spiritually clear, As though through some celestial atmosphere, That round a world of boundless glory rolls, The fair abode of pure angelic souls, 'Twas strained and filtered,âwhere the brightest part Of light from Seraph's eye-beams seems to dart,â Each added flushânay, each alternate ray, From heavenward-journeying pinions seems to play, Or from the halos round Saint's brows to glance away. Oh loveliest Scene! it graciously bereaves The heart of half its careâwhich thence receives, A golden boon of quietâsoft and deep, Shed o'er the Spirit like the dews of sleep. Yes! yes! it cheats the heart of half its care, A scene so exquisitely calm and fair, A scene so lovely and serene as this; And gladly doth the Soul-soothed Wanderer miss That load of weariness which ofttimes rests On world-worn feelings; those delightful guests, Content and Pleasure, too, are won to glide Into the bosomâwhile their gentle guide Is holy Admiration, she whose birth Can sanctify at once the encircling Earth, The Skyâthe Airâthe Seaâthe outshining Show Of mighty Nature's Opulence below, (If she herself directed duly be In the rich kindlings of her ecstasy By calm, discriminating Judgment's aidâ By no false views beguiled â nor hollow doubts betrayed). How can we dwell with rapture on the works Nor think on the Creator? and there lurks In such high Contemplation, free and full, A Pleasure such as Worldlings ne'er may cull From Life's poor Vanities, short-lived and dull; A Pleasureâdeep and true and calm and pure, Bright while it lasts, and privileged to endure In Memory's records longâto which the heart Without one pang of conscience may revertâ A Pleasure, rare and peaceful and refined, Such as improves and elevates the mind, There bringing forth most fair and wholesome fruit: How unlike joys that pall and that pollute! And a Contentment that may well pervade The thoughtful breast, that soberly hath weighed The wretched, worthless mockeries of Earth, Its hollow goodâits miserable mirth, And found that Nature only can afford Delights that well and worthily accord With the immortal Soul's desires, that spring Upon a vigorous and aspiring wing! Yet howsoe'er they proudly swell and soar, She, from her all-exhaustless fund and store, Can brightly satisfy and crown them still, And the sublimest wishes best fulfil! How can we ev'n in loftiest mood pretend To bliss of purer Origin or Endâ Oh! how can we in loftiest mood desire Aught that is nobler, finer, prouder, higher, Than thus to view the Works of the Most High, If with a chastened mind and tutored eye âAnd hold divine communion with the Sky âThan thus in hallowed ecstasies to stand, And mark the achievements of the Omnific Hand! Than thus to standâand to participate Almost in his Supreme and Kingly State, Who made and rules the vast Creation spread Around our steps, where'er those steps are led; For this triumphant and august display, That's opened out for everânight and day; This theatre of Natureâwhose wide range Of glorious Scenes in all their boundless changeâ Is always spread our feasted eyes beforeâ To our free view exposed for evermoreâ 'Tis this that doth outstretched and open lie, In prospect fair beneath the Eternal Eye. And shall not weâpoor, abject, creeping worms, Frail atomsâpassing shadowsâfleeting formsâ Oh! shall not we, too undeserving, rest In measurless contentâthus richly bless'd; Ay, we should bask in fulness of contentâ With lowly thankfulness profoundly blentâ And give our souls up to a lofty joy, Whose pure delights can never pall nor cloy, A bliss, that rightly weighed can be no less Than perfect, full, and exquisite Happiness! A soaring joyâwhose wings are light and airâ Which with the spher?d Hierarchies we share, Who bend from their high thronesâand evermore Give thanks, extol, exult, admire, adoreâ And still ascribing unto Him alone, Who on a Pyramid of Worlds His throne Hath builtâconfronted and approached by none, The Glory, triumph, honour, powerârenew Their zealous praises circling ages through: They may â they do, with loftier minds than ours, With keener faculties and mightier powers, Upon the glories of Creation gazeâ And track its vast and complicated maze; But if, with faith and zeal and heavenly love, We cast our eyes around, beneath, above, And with a vigilant Veneration, teach By smooth degrees our climbing thoughts to reach, If not the more surpassing wonders wrought By Him â whose greatness foils our labouring thought, At least the undoubting consciousness profound, That his Omnipotence can know no bound âBeyond all finite faculties to soundâ A bright promotion we shall surely gain,â To something more than knowledge shall attain; Unto Initiation deep and free, Ev'n may unconsciously admitted be, In the most dreadâthe Sovereign Mystery! While that pure judgment we may thus acquire, Which to the Highest leaves, thoughts struggling high and higher; And that pure wisdom shall be all our own Which bids proud Reason sink, subdued and prone, Fain to admit how little can be known, While we're thus barred and circumscribed from birth By the dull, narrow boundaries of Earth. And let us not forget ev'n those dread Powers, The Angels and Archangelsâin Heaven's own bowersâ Throned on high Council-Seatsâin specular towersâ Whence they, exulting and entranced, behold Thingsâunimaginable and untold; They, of stupendous faculties possessed, And glorious energies that ne'er need rest, With space-transpiercing eyes, space-cleaving wingsâ Even they may sound n t Heav'n's deep hidden things! Oh! Scene of Beauty! must I say adieu To all thy charms just opened on my view, And most reluctantly my path pursue? I must! but Memory's strong and faithful spell Shall surely make this but a half farewell; In fancy I shall oft again behold This loved scene, cast in more ethereal mould. All shall be mine again! and fitly seen, By pale, pure Dream-lightâmost like that, I ween, Which pours its tender, tremulous radiance here, Soft as the quivering lustres of a tear. All shall be mine againâmine own once moreâ All, all shall Memory's magic might restore. The soft obscurityâthe brightened shades, Which such a haunting dreaminess pervades The sudden gleams of deep cerulean sky, That seems in its transparent rest to lie, When caught at times by the upward-straining eye, Height above height, unmeasured and unscaled, And Firmament o'er Firmament unveiled; The dewy calm, the exquisite repose, The winding endlessness, where pleased to lose, Mid thick involving shades, its aimless way, Thought, led by busy Fancy, loves to stray. The umbrageous sheltering of these Olive-treesâ The bright blue rolling of those laughing Seas! Whose sunlit waves just here and there are seen, Through these twined boughs and leaves of softest green, Shivered into a thousand stars of light, (In sparkling rivalry of some clear Night,) Thousands and tens of thousands, yet more bright, Thus shewn by fitful glimpsings, shivered thusâ Oh! yet more bright, more fair, more luminous These glittering waters seem, than when surveyed, At once, with all their radiancies displayed, With all their fair expanse at once exposedâ The Sources of their borrowed wealth disclosed! Now we might dream a second Heaven is thereâ A Heaven all starsâto its rich depths laid bare; Quivering and palpitating on the sight, A heaving, tremulous mass of Life and Light. Lo! how the waters through the foliage glance; 'Tis with a two-fold motion that they dance. These restless leaves their restlessness impart To them (the while they thrill, and quake, and start To the Wind's breathâthe breath of this soft breeze, That like a Spirit moves around the trees, And trembles o'er the surface of the seas); For momently their brightness they reveal, And in caprice as suddenly conceal; Alternately, with wanton strife and play, To sight they shift them, and then snatch away A lightning-glimpseâan instantaneous stay: And they have delicate motion of their own, Motion provoked not by the breeze alone; The mighty pulse of Ocean's giant breast, That never intermission knows, nor rest, With gentlest stir uplifts them evermore, And softly agitates that shining floor. A sweet perplexity results from thence, That in confusing charms the cheated sense; For Nature's soft perplexities are such, They make us wish for more where we find much. And thus could I, the hours of this calm day Unwearied in this sweet spot wear away, The sport of Fanciesâlively, yet sereneâ That spring from the suggestions of the scene. RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CORNICHE. By the edge of Precipices steep and dread, I journeyed, silent as the shrouded Dead; For the quick thoughts that rushed upon my soul, Defied disclosure and disdained control, And while those thoughts were thrilled and rapt, and fired, Electrified, upraised, absorbed, inspired, Expression in abortive sighs expired; Words had been like cold water-drops, when thrown O'er some bright, vivid painting, that had grown Beneath the artist's hands with such winged haste, That every stroke was wetâso newly traced,â And but too lightly, easily effaced: Or if not all effacedâconfused and mixed, Ere stamped indeliblyâand deeply fixed. Thus words had been, if rashly showered along The new impressions of my Soulâthough strong, Yet immaturedâthough vivid, not engrained Deep in the mindânor long to be retained Without the aid of Contemplation mute, Whose ponderings best with new-born feelings suit, (Even like the Potter's paintings, ere the flames Have to endurance given them fadeless claims, And to their delicate fragile beauty lent A glory durable and permanent!)â So had they mingled and confused the hues, Which did my Spirit's very depths suffuse: The burning huesâthe bright and glowing dyes, That flushed my feeling's inmost sanctuaries! But like those water-drops when gently shed On storied canvass that hath long o'erspread Some dim deserted Image-chamber's wall, Freshening the faded dyes where'er they fallâ Ev'n like those water drops, when lightly flung O'er pictured Scrolls that long exposed have hung (Haply in some neglected nook immured) By dust and cobwebs clouded and obscured: Those drops, that fall like tears of glistening dew, Some withered flower's lost splendour that renewâ Bringing forth every magic touch again, And cleansing every casual spot and stain, Making the troubled outlines fresh and clearâ Till in its pristine splendour doth appear That rainbow-coloured triumph of proud Art, Till the dimmed hues and darkened traceries start Once more to sight, as though those forms that graced The soulless canvassâmore than half-effaced, The Artist's own fine hand retouched, retraced; While the long-buried Images outshine, Unfolding, part by part, and line by line; Like some sweet vision bursting on the viewâ A finished work in every stroke and hueâ Some fair Creationâwhose bright scenes expand, Touched lightly by an unseen Wizard's wand! Thusâthusâmay words in far-off after-days Bring back unto my longing mental gaze, The rich enchantments of that rapturous hour In all their freshness, liveliness, and power; While ev'n more delicately bright and clear, In that sweet resurrection they appear, Unto the dreaming eye so softly shownâ With Memory's magic mantle round them thrown, By Memory's trembling moonlight-ray revealedâ Too long in dull obscurity concealed! Ah! while to others we would seek to unveil The charms of some bright scene, the glowing tale Warms into life those memories dim and pale, That half-unconsciously we yet retain, And unto us they're thus restored again. And oftâhow oft, when we would strive to unfold What our emotions wereâere all is told, Back on ourselves those sweet emotions flow, With quickened power, and renovated glow, And we're at once won back into the Past, Before so veiled, obscured, and overcast. On back-ground dim, of soft regrets relieved, Clear sweet impressions, that we then receivedâ Like beauteous butterflies escapedâthat fled, And faint and fainter colourings ever shed From parting pinions, far and farther ledâ Like those bright, lovely butterflies recaught, Shall fluttering come, to settle on our thought; And from that shadowy back-ground surely gain New lustre and new lifeânor brief nor vainâ And Fancyâwhile to sight they thronging start, Shall seem yet richer colourings to impart Than those which at their dawn and birth they bore, Ere they were wide dispersed and darkened o'er: Then shall those sweet impressions brightly dwell Within the hiving bosom's secret cell; Then shall they live within the quick heart's coreâ That best of sanctuariesâfor evermore; Revived with yet redoubled power and grace, For no new train of feelings to displaceâ No chance to eradicateâno change to erase; Then shall they, rescued from Oblivion's grave, Defy thenceforth her Lethe's leaden wave. Yea! language such as truth doth sole inspire, May, with a stroke of lightâa breath of fire, Melt off the incumbent shades, the incrusting seal, And images on images reveal! Then may that broken Seal expose anew, Those long-stamped luminous characters to view, Which an invisible hand erst softly drewâ Then may the scattered clouds at once disclose Each lovely vision that behind them glows. As when dissolved the chains of cumbering Frost Leave free the Streams whose glittering light was lost: As when the snow-wreaths, from the mountain's side Loosened by sunbeamsâever as they glide Adown the uneven steeps, lay bare to the eye The verdurous promise, smiling at the sky: As when a vapour, by the wind's soft breath Dispersed, reveals the sparkling sea beneath: As when a veil withdrawn at once, displays The emergent objects to the observer's gaze: As when an unclasped volume to the sight Discloses page on page, emblazoned bright! Clad ev'n in heaven-touched hues they reappear, Things haply lost and buried many a year, In all their wonted power and native pride, Amongst themselves harmoniously allied, One thoughtâone kindling and inspiring thought, With fervour quickened, and with feeling fraught, Wakened by wizard words, ten thousand moreâ An inexhaustibly abounding store, Can unconfusedly, yet swiftly bring, Like some fair flight of birds upon the wing; Or like successive waves, each following fast The otherâas though none would be the last; Or like bright stars, that still, when one hath crost Night's threshold, press in thickly-mustering host; Or as the Spring's young leavesâthat when the first Hath been set free, by shining myriads burst Their silken sheathsâwith dew and sunshine nursed, And with their clustering and luxuriant pride, The stalks that bore them in adorning hide; Or as those large drops, that in sultry hours Plash down with startling noise on banks and bowers (The big drops of the exulting Thunder-showers), And when the first hath fallen, the alarm to sound, Beat loud and louder still on the echoing ground!â One note recalls the whole enchanting strain; One link restores the whole electric chain; One spark relumes the half-extinguished blaze; One stroke repairs the half-evanished traits; One seed requickenethâsoon as it is sown, The whole rich Harvest's growthâone seed alone; One word reprompts all, all the exciting tale; One step re-piles the whole unmeasured scale; One thought, one breath, one glance can conjure backâ Like swift clouds sweeping o'er their destined track, The things that were, in such a rushing tide, That lo! the things that are seem thrust aside. Thusâthusâthose glorious, wond'rous Scenes, ev'n thus, All clear, distinct and fair and luminous, May yet revisit mine enraptured eyes, When at some future period fondly tries My tongue to speak their wonders and their charms, Till my brain kindles, and my bosom warms, Till my pulse flutters and my Spirit burns, And all the Past in all its power returns! What if Expression fail at lengthâonce more Taxed to the utmost, as it failed before, At least it will have laid the auspicious train Whose bright explosion shall restore again Those mines of wealth unto my grasping holdâ Wealth, costlier far than gems or burning gold. Oh! 'twas a marvellousâa matchless Scene! And keen the enjoyment was, full, full and keen, That then through every wakened feeling thrilled, But deep the awe wherewith my soul was filled, Oh! deep the awe through every thought instill'd. A stern and terrible enchantment there Brooded o'er Scenes gigantically fairâ Terrifically Beautifulâthat charmed, Yet charmingâstunned, and staggered, and alarmed, And drew with a resistless magic sway From all beside the centred mind away! A horrible Fascination lived along The glorious terrors of the Sceneâa throng Of shadowy dim Attractions rose around, That called and beckoned, without show or sound;â They rose and reigned, like Spirits of the Spot; By them impelled and urgedâin thought I shot Each dreadful gulph of darkness, yawning deep, Or hung supportless on the slippery steep; In thought to each dizzy point, high, high in air, By them was drawn as by a single hair; In thought, by them suspended, shuddering, swung On these slight boughs, all tremulously hung Over those hideous precipicesâfrail As though they might be snapped by each faint gale; Nay, by each breath of every passing breeze, And torn and severed from their parent trees! So was the vexed Spirit made the sport Of dim, unseen temptationsâin such sort By mystical excitements 'twas impelled, Not to be mocked, resisted, calmed, or quelled. Strange Impulses seemed busy in the breast, By wild Emotions was the Soul possessed, And powerful Instincts crowded on the mind, With vague, blind, dreamy sympathies entwined;â While these were more inexplicably mixed With stern Antipathies, stampedârootedâfixed! Lingerings, recoilings, yearnings, doubts, and fearsâ The weight that crushesâand the warmth that cheers; The shock that startlesâand the pause that soothes; The strife that rufflesâand the calm that smoothes; All in their turn my troubled Spirit knew,â Nay, from all points at once the winds opposing blew;â Conflicting Influences my Being swayed, Each mutely, unresistingly obeyedâ The Adverse Impressions stamped upon my soul, Made it, as 'twere, one dark, inscrutable scroll, Where characters on characters impressed In dim confusion, troubled and distressed The labouring thoughtâ(the investigating thought, That still those strange, illegible traceries sought To unravel, to decypher, and to expound, Yet evermore its efforts hopeless found; That close entangled web might not be thus unwound!) And passed athwart my kindling, working brain Of startling Phantasies full many a train, Till Thoughtâtill Senseâtill Spiritâand till Frame Seemed wrapt and bound in one consuming flame! My troubled pulsesâoh! at once they felt Compressed and cramped in adamantine belt, And painfully disquieted and stirredâ By impulse after impulse roused and spurred; A weight of deep suspense and terror lay Upon their feverish strife, and restless play:â My very breathings then appeared to be Suspended in that spasm of ecstasy; And yet, oh! 'twas not so; but thick, and fast, And deep, as though each gasp must be the last, Came the low, stifled sobs, and broken sighs, Unheeded in that hour's full, rich surprise! Wherefore, 'midst Scenes where Giant terrors spread, As though to crush the Soul with whelming dread, Delights that soul in magnifying still Each threatening harm, and each foreboded ill;â And more:âOh! wherefore doth it onwards press, As in a wild Despair's worst, last excess, To revel 'mongst those terrorsâdire and deep, Until the very flesh doth seem to creep; The vexed brain whirlsâthe wrung nerves quivering thrillâ The aching bosom owns a sickening chillâ The throbbing temples feel an icy dewâ The heart is struck by panic strange and new. Why doth the soul feel near and nearer drawn, By all-resistless impulse, to where yawn The deadliest gulphs, and frown the gloomiest shadesâ What force impelsâwhat inner voice persuades? We feelâwe feel already wildly lost, Dashed from the heights, and as by whirlwinds tossed: The abrupt, quick, crushing, shattering, mangling fall, The plunge, the whirl, the shockâwe feel it all! Like Martyrs hurried to the stakeâthat kneel, Already half consumed by fiery zeal, And the unlit flames anticipating feel! Why doth the mindâyet stung with fond remorseâ Why doth the mind 'gainst its own will ev'n force, Mid such o'erwhelming scenes as those, where wide Dismay and Terror reign on every side, The shuddering, lingering, faultering Frame to act o'er With breathless fear, increasing more and more The struggle, and the anguish, and the strifeâ The final tragic scene 'twixt Death and Lifeâ The all of horror that is there reserved For that lost wretch whose tottering step hath swerved, Though but a hair's breadth, 'mongst those perilous ways, Where dark Destruction, ever watching, staysâ The dread catastropheâthe hideous closeâ The deadly crisis of unuttered woes; For by some secret influence, keen and fellâ Some strong, strange Sympathy's prevailing spell, Constrained too surelyâaided but too well, Rehearses painfully the feeling frame (Oh! through what mystic aid, and with what aim?) Its dreadful lessonâits most dolourous part, As with refined, unerring, matchless art! Too faithfully rehearses and repeats, While thrills each sensitive nerve, each quick pulse beats In fearful unison and dread accord, To invest with terrible truth that dream abhorred. Down, down, a thousand fathoms down below, In that delirious phantasy we go, While still that dark attraction evermore Grows stronger, deeper, keener than before; And still we own, in that wild dance of Death, Temptation centring in the abyss beneath! Whence springs that hurrying phrenzy of the soulâ Jealous of contradiction and controul,â Impatient of impediment and stay, Earnest to try the dark, forbidden way; And goaded on by rash, imperious pride, To court stern Danger as a worshipped Bride;â To look impending Ruin in the face, And rush into Destruction's fell embrace, As with one desperate plungeâone passionate burstâ At once driven onâto dare and do the worst, And slake on Certainty its maddening thirst, And pre-ordained conclusions rashly try, With strict, inexorable Destiny! As though at once the appointed end 't would seek, And on Extremity exulting wreak The feverish, quick excitements of Suspense, Ever too keen, and harrowing, and intense; Sayâis 't the o'erflowing Engergies of Life, That meet half-way the Struggle and the Strifeâ The o'erflowing Energies of Lifeâthat thus Stir up the thoughts in wild throngs mutinous! While Opposition but strikes forth the fire From every dormant wish and lulled desireâ While the roused Mind each imminent peril braves, Like some strong swimmer battling with the waves, Who finds the tossing surge, the breeze, the spray But lend his quickened pulse more vigorous play, And while he deals his free and skilful strokes, Feels that resistance but new force provokes. Is't these o'erflowing Energies that wake Thrist for Adventureâfor Adventure's sake!â Is't the excitement that upsprings from thenceâ Is't of quick Life the rich, luxuriant senseâ The strong emotions quivering in the breast, The whirl of passionate pulses, in the unrest Of their precipitate play and spring-tide gush? The full-blown strengthâthe exhilarating flushâ Oh! is't of feverish Life's intense excessâ The untamed, intoxicating consciousness That thus leads on the over-weening mind,â To pain, to peril, to destruction blind? Or is 't the Human Being's natural pride That loathes to be restricted or denied, And from itself instinctively would hide The bitter truth, which forces still its way Against our willâthat we, frail Sons of clay, Are but the reeds upon the current cast, Where strong Necessity her law hath passed, That we poor wormsâall helpless weakness are, Where Nature breathes her ban and heaves her barâ Sayâis't that pride which thus with stern controul Governs and guides at will the yielding soul?â The Spirit's prideâthat thus by Matter's laws Thwarted, obstructed, and constrained to pause, With stormy indignation roused and fired, With wild, delirious ardour filled, inspired, Would spread its own eternal wingsâand soar Above the limits it may not pass o'er; Its own eternal wingsâthat, swift as wind, Would leave all bars, bolts, boundaries far behind? Or is't the love of Power, so deeply sown In Mortal natures, that when most they own Their weakness, their dependence, and their bounds, When shew of dreadâof absolute Power surroundsâ Then smit by Disappointment sore, they most Seek with fool-hardy vauntâvain-glorious boastâ To thrust aside the humiliating sense Of their deficiency and impotence! And struggle from themselves e'en to conceal The inferiority they keenly feel; And when, despite of the unconquered will, The certainty of failure mocks them still, One desperate effort, and one fierce essay, They fain would make for Victory and for sway. And strive to force the Elements to obey? Is't this that prompts the dreadful wish, confessed Within the secret confines of the breast; The passionate yearning from the Soul that springsâ The Soulâdeep Mother of mysterious things? Is't this that doth, in hours so dark and wild, Wind up to such proud pitch the mind beguiledâ That still that wish new force, new fervour gains, While the warm blood seems curdling in the veins,â The inexplicable wish we feel to seek, With venturous foot, the topmost pointing peak, And thence, with horrible, headlong haste, to fling The shuddering formâwith one mad, desperate spring, As though to split on black Destruction's shelves Were painlessâso the choice were from ourselves; So we might seem to govern and to guide Imperious Fateâor, ranged upon her side, Give the dread signal, 'gainst ourselves allied: Thus would we hurl defiance at the array Of threatening barriers that impede our way. Or is't the thirst for Knowledge, deep and strong, That hurries thus the impetuous thoughts along; While Reason vainly strives her rule to enforce, And check them in their mad, eccentric course? Is it from this those inward promptings come, That make us long to shoot the gulphs of Doomâ To rush with fierce precipitation on, Until at once enlightened and undone, When the Great Mystery motions and invites, And tempts the Soul to try forbidden flights! We dream we hear its faint, low, thrilling call, The deep, dread Mysteryâmost profound of allâ Ev'n Deathâterrific and triumphant Deathâ That beckons us, his dusk shroud from beneath, And draws us by a thin, invisible chain, And flits before us with a ghostly trainâ A shadowy retinue of phantom things, (Whose birth from our disordered fancy springs; Pale-eyed Amazements, Terrors, Doubts, Despairs, While all and each the excited Spirit dares), And wins usâspite of horror and alarm, With fastening, flattering, fascinating charmâ With strong Attraction, magnet-like and sure, Too powerful to entangle and to allure; Still, still it leads the yearning Spirit on. Great Heaven! how soon the dread goal might be wonâ The mighty question solved, declared, exposedâ The important truth discovered and disclosed: One light, incautious stepâone careless turnâ One heedless movement, and how soon to learn That awful lessonâthat tremendous loreâ That fearful secret might be oursâbefore So hidden from our view, so veiled, so masked, That hopelessly the labouring mind was tasked To pierce its marvels, dark and recondite, And drag the appalling Mystery to the light, Which proud Philosophy hath striven, in vain, Age after age to expound and to explain; Which all the labours of unwearying thought, 'Mid all the triumphs Intellect hath wrought, Have failed to lay before our seeking eyesâ That knowledge Man can gain not till he dies! How soon those barriers might be overpastâ Those gates thrown open wide, soon, soon and fastâ How soon that clasped and covered page unsealed, And all the deep contents at once revealedâ How soon that dense and massy curtain raised, Behind whose folds no living eye ere gazedâ That veil through whose dread gloom no sight can pierce, That cuts in twain the Eternal Universeâ That doth the unbounded Universe divide, While half lies bared, and half those stern folds hide Until it seems to us, that view not Heaven Too widely, fearfully asunder riven, Half Life, half Death, half Darkness, and half Light, Half dull Stagnation, half rejoicing Might; Half the strong Is, and half the shadowy Wasâ While still the First doth in the Latter pass. Say, is't from this those phantasies arise That seize the soul in many a dark disguise? Oh! is't the thirst for Knowledge, strong and deep, Which makes us pant to try the fatal leap? The thirst for Knowledge, or the love of Power, Each mightiest of the mighty in their hour?â Or the quick morbid sensitiveness of pride, With jealous indignation's force alliedâ Or of Life's energies the o'erburdening sense, That pine for Action ev'n at Life's expenseâ Luxuriantâpassionateâfiery and intense! Say, is't from any one of these, or all, Those Phantasies like monstrous Shadows fall?â Whate'er that strange Infatuation be, It is a sealed and shrouded mystery! And fearfully it ruled, with dark controul, In those deep moments, all my troubled soulâ Nor then I sought the enshrouding veil to lift, Nor then essayed to analyze or sift The ambiguous feelings and the unequal mood, That so completely swayed me and subdued. Oh! 't was a wondrous trance that fired my brain; Half calm, half storm, half pleasure and half pain. It was a waking and a wondrous tranceâ Half ecstasy, half horrorâwhile each glance New subjects still for new reflections brought Unto the excited and the enraptured thought, With an adoring Consternation fraught, And ruffled with a stormy, strong delight, Too fierce and restless in its rushing mightâ Too quick, too vehement, in its sweeping sway, Until it darkly bordered on dismay! Oh! all surpassing, overpowering scene! Well might the awe be deep, the enjoyment keen, Wherewith spontaneously I trembling hailed The outshining world of Wonders there unveiled, The o'erwhelming burst of glories there revealedâ Nature's own trophy-piled, triumphal field! Where, though reposing from no blood-stained war, She rests a laurelled Conqueress on her car; Luxuriant barrennessâelaborate wasteâ Sweet Peace, in Desolation's arms embraced; Strong Eloquence, with Silence' hush entwined; Bright Grace, 'midst dread Sublimities enshrined; Thick-haunted SolitudeâDisorder fairâ Oh! what harmonious Contradictions there Were blent and mixed in solemn Union rare; Union of startling contrasts and extremes, Such as oft come to mock us in our dreams (When feverish workings trouble and molest The needful hours of Slumber's golden rest); Yet, yet I felt, 'midst those proud hills and rocks, Nature perplexes oftâbut never mocks! How whilst I gazed, with hushed amaze around, Fresh glories 'midst that Prospect vast I found! Like granite billows heaved in thousand shapes, Appeared those mountainous formsâwith beaked capes, With huge curled Crestsâthat soared into the skiesâ While proudly each upreared its giant sizeâ While light clouds wreathing round each soaring crest, Seemed like the spray from the Ocean's working yeast; As though those vast, enormous billows, rose In agony and furyâlashed by blows From the unseen Storm-Fiendsâo'er huge hidden rocks Tossed, shivered, shattered with convulsive shocksâ 'Stead of themselves being thus huge rocks sublime, That so have ramped and reared throughout all Time. As though that mountainous Chain was meant to be A vast Colossal Statue of the Sea! These Granite Giants thus were meant to form A Statue of the Sea and of the Storm! Dread Waves!âso silent and so motionlessâ Doth not your very stillness help to impress The Spirit with a more religious awe? And from its depths doth not your Silence draw A fuller homage, that would breathe in prayers, But, taught by ye, all language it forbears? How were ye thus heaved up in solid wallsâ Whence no stray fragment melting, loosening, fallsâ Like the obedient tides of the Old Red Sea, That saw the favoured Host pass safe and free Through their riven depths, and soft, then cast aside All the dread terrors of their power and pride; But oh! not so their looks of threatening might, Those fiercer billows softened to the sight! Nor laid aside with motion and with sound Their awful aspect, scattering gloom around! They seemed, thus checked, and sentenced thus to stand, By some resistless and supreme command, When at their fury's wildest pitch and worst Their most o'erwhelming sweep and fiercest burst! 'T was thus to Fancy's vision they appeared, While each its giant frame, sublime, upreared, And imaged forth too painfully and plain The maddening ire of a tempestuous main! Yet such stern lessons they ne'er learned from thee, Thou blue, broad mirror of tranquillityâ Smooth, bright, transparent Mediterranean Sea! (Or so I deemed, beholding thy clear breast, By zephyrs and by sunbeams soothed, caressed, What time I mused on thy enchanted shore, And blessed the look of peace thine aspect wore, Could ever roaring gale and rugged storm Presume that Heavenly Beauty to deformâ Mar that ambrosial luxury of repose, And break the Elysian calm that round thee throws Almost an air of Sanctityâwhen shine Thy waves beneath blue skiesâscarce more divine?) But howsoe'er such lessons harsh and stern Those Rocks, those frowning Heights were made to learn, Too darkly they presented, near and far, The troublous show of strife, and wrath, and war; And thus my mind was with wild conflicts vexed, By dark opposing influences perplexed; The Immortal, the Immaterial learned to share The Mortal, the Material trouble there. Ah! rather 't was the living Soul alone That then did the anxious Agitation own; No heaving pulse might ruffle and molest The Mountainous region's adamantine breast; 'Tis but of Strife the semblance and the showâ Peace, perfect Peace, for ever lurks below. Oh! the least pulse of even the meanest thing That crawls, creeps, swims, or moves on tiniest wing, More wringing painâmore perturbation sharesâ More startling, thrilling, keen emotion bears, Than all the Eternal Elements can feel, Whate'er of wild disorder they reveal. Can feel? oh no!âthis solid Earth may reelâ The Old Ocean toss and raveâthe Mountains look Splitâriven by thunder-stroke on thunder-stroke; But there is pain, strife, trouble, fear, suspense, Only where Life isâthrobbing Life and Sense!â No! 'twas my fluttering pulses wildly fought, And from Strife's semblance Strife's contagion caught; My struggling thoughts, that worked with painful play Beneath tumultuous Passion's fearful sway,â At once were they with keener powers endowed, And shadowed, withered, wrapt in stifling shroudâ Beleaguered and enfranchisedâthrilled and tamedâ Benumbed, o'erwrought, lashed, petrified, inflamed; Now like mad Lightnings in their strength and might, What time they plough the pitchy waste of Night; Now like dead leaves, whirled powerless on the blast, And hither, thither, hurried far and fast; Now with a Cataract's leap swift plunging down The dismal steeps, back on themselves now thrown In wild confusion, like clouds shouldering clouds, In shadowing clusters and in huddled crowds, When some fierce Tempest darkens o'er the day, And through the labouring welkin drives its way; But yet one certain, one unquestioned vein Of thrilling, piercing pleasure did remain Through every passing mood of rapid change, Bewildering, startling, complicated, strange, That threw those checquering shadows o'er my thoughtâ Those wild Emotions to my feelings brought! And so it must be, when to Nature's Throne, Where in her Glorious State she dwells alone, We reverentially and meekly bring A free heart's uncontaminated spring. And as we onwards fared, I felt there rose From that Tremendous Beauty (whose repose Was like the Gladiator's heavy rest, When his stern powers in slumber lay suppress'dâ The ponderous strength of whose dread, vigorous arm Seemed as suspended then by some deep charm, While the strong man was as a little child With rugged features, almost smoothed and mild), A cloud of solemn and of precious hints, That stamped my thoughts with long-enduring printsâ A cloud of gentle counsels, soft and deep, That did at length with tender influence steep My Spirit in a reverential calmâ A gracious dewiness of healing balm; And yet at times a faint, chill, dull suspenseâ A dim, bewildered, and uneasy sense, Troubled and indistinct, appeared to be The shadow of some dark Uncertainty, That hovered round my heart with heavy wings, And altered all the outward face of thingsâ A sad perplexityâa withering doubt, That seemed as half within and half without; While Nature's countenance, o'ershadowed, wore Expressions yet more solemn than before; That dim and anxious sense at times arose, And chased away my newly-found repose:â The blessed calm that tenderly suffused The heart that feltâthe watchful mind that mused. Wherefore? sayâwas't not that my dreaming ear Caught murmurings of reproach, which wrought that fearâ Reproachâthat with those counsels deep and soft Seemed dimly mingling?âYea, 'twas that did waft The uneasy tremblings to my listening heart; That listenedâbroodedâwatched and dreamed apart. Did not those tongueless Oracles repeat, In wild, unearthly language, stern yet sweetâ Those voiceless Oraclesâthat hung midway 'Twixt Earth and Heavenâdid they not seem to say, âBe pure, Undying Spirit! be thou pure! That must, when Rocks and Hills succumb, endureâ Endureâwhate'er may be thy sentenced doomâ Beyond the dark gates of the frowning tomb!â Did they not seem, too, in the self-same breath, To inquire, in whispers as the call of Death, Low, clear, distinct, and not to be o'erborne By heartless clamour or the laugh of Scornâ âAnd art thou pure? Undying Spirit, say? Thou, that canst never change nor pass awayâ That must for ever and for ever live, And all Creation's soulless frame surviveâ That must through boundless ages still exist, When the great Stars are from their stations missedâ When Suns and Systems darkly are displaced, And Nature's web's unwoundâher mighty plan effacedâ From Everlasting to Everlasting made To endure unbowedâunwitheredâundecayed?â 'T was Conscience lent to things inanimate Her awful voiceâa voice of fear and fate;â 'T was Conscience â Conscience whispered in mine ear, For ever wakeful and for ever near, And always skilfulâalway on the watch, Her golden opportunities to snatch;â Conscience! o'erpowering Conscience!âshe that fills The Heaven's blue concave and the ancient hills, The whispering forests, and the sunbright plains, And the loud City's vast and crowded fanes, With her pure voice, that varying now appears Like judgment-thundersânow like eloquent tears!â She that doth lend that voice of myriad tones To waves and windsâto leaves, clouds, reeds and stones, And makes the Earth, the Air, the Seas, the Skiesâ Ambassadors, and Agents, and Allies; And her momentous task untired pursues, Until she win the Soul to purer viewsâ Until she draw the enfranchised thoughts away From all the encumbering vanities of clay. Oh! still she pleads and provesâprompts, threats and chidesâ Arouses, teaches, smites, sustains and guidesâ Melts through the Soul, and through the senses glidesâ Breathes through all things, and watches through all timesâ Broods o'er all scenes, and follows through all climesâ Puts on all aspects, and assumes all forms, And from withoutâwithinâthe obdurate Soul she storms! THE CAMPO SANTO, AT PISA. Earth of the Holy Land!âwherein repose The mouldering bones of thousandsâwhereon grows The unscorched, bright grass of Europeâemerald-green, Luxuriantlyâso lending to the scene A vivid freshness, touching to behold, Midst these surrounding objects, dim and old; Sepulchral trophies of this Funeral Ground, That tell of Deathâand nought but Death around! Thrice honoured mouldâthrice venerated Earth! Looking on thee, what deep thoughts spring to birth? Deep thoughts of far-off scenesâof far-off daysâ (Till buried things seem opening on the gaze)â Deeds long ago performedâevents long pastâ But whose momentous consequences last, And ever shall, when all besides is lostâ Ruinedâdecayedânay, that e'en then the most Shall be in all their boundless scope revealed, With all their awful mysteries unsealed; That then shall most victoriously appear, With all their deepest secrets made most clearâ All their immense importance then outspreadâ Importance how tremendous, and how dread! These thoughts come rushing o'er my musing mind, With hopes, emotions, yearnings, fears entwined. Thrice hallowed Earth! thrice consecrated Mould! And can the gathered embers ere grow cold Embedded here?âand dare Corruption come To do dishonour to so proud a tomb? Sanctified Soil!âoh! sacred, sacred Sod! For ever hallowed by the Incarnate God, Whose pure feet pressed thee on His destined way To Eternal triumph on the appointed day! How doth my memory kindlingly revert, While beats with heavy throbs my troubled heart To those past yearsâthose awful scenes afar, While Timeâwhile Distance interpose their bar In vain;â(for ah! as though in truth I'd seen With mine own eyesânor veil nor cloud between; As though with mine own ears I'd trembling heardâ Perceived, discerned what then and there occurred, With mine own sensesâtracked that fearful ground With mine own feetâmidst thronging thousands round, And in my living person there had been An awed spectator of each wond'rous scene. Now with a dread distinctness I retrace Those recollectionsâthat at once embrace The depths of horror and the heights of hope, Heaven, Doom, Eternity, within their scope!) Now flies my Spirit to that solemn spot Whence came this mouldâne'er, ne'er to be forgotâ That spot, beyond Earth's proudest scenes renowned, Where Heaven's astounding plan of Love was crowned! Oh! precious Earth!âoh! beatific dust! Nor pillar, tombstone, urn, nor featured bust Should we within these awful precincts scan, Since not on the Individualâbut on Man, Must we with contrite bosoms ponder hereâ For oh! in heavenly language, deep and clear, Thou eloquent dust! thou speak'st unto the soul, And not of partâof portionâof the whole!â By the Universal Race was shared the fallâ The great Redemption was bestowed on all. Oh! let me bid ye hail, blest Earth! all hail! While my heart trembles to the affecting tale, The old story of your prompt conveyance here, By hands the mightiest with the lance and spear, The readiest in the stormy battle field, When shivered round lay crest, and sword, and shield, Still, still the readiest War's dread arms to bear, Or to be clasped and strained in solemn prayer. Say, did the willing Elements unite To speed your passage with their peaceful might?â Say, did the hushed Sea gently heave beneath The Pisan galleysâand with favouring breath Did the winds waft them to the Ausonian shore, As conscious of the freight those galleys bore, Far richer than all wealth of gem and ore What time the Championâthe Crusader fired With holiest faith Ubaldo Lanfranci.âwith loftiest zeal inspiredâ The Warrior-prelateâPilgrim-patriot gave, The sacred treasure to the smiling waveâ Committed to the Deep the valued store, Destined to enrich the far Etrurian shore?â Earth from Mount Calvaryâfor Pisa's Dead, As in a more than proudâthan Royal bed To rest in, when by their last sleep oppressedâ The deepest, sweetest, calmest, longest, bestâ The one unvexed, unfeverish, full repose, Unvisited by ghosts of buried woesâ Not to be broken by the Morning's light, How oft unwelcome to the unwilling sight! Surely when dark and slow the Funeral train Came on, and sobs arose of natural pain And human sorrow, whose pathetic power Might not be all o'ermastered in such hour; 'T was with a warmer hopeâa happier trust, While Earth to Earth was said, and dust to dust, The fond survivors saw their Dead bestowed In that blest soil whereon the Lord had trode; That Holy Earth of the most Holy Land, Which well they might deem haunted by a bandâ A Heavenly band, intent to trace and bless The sacred footsteps which he deigned to impress On mortal groundâHe, the Everlasting King, Who robbed the Spectre Death of his worst sting, And of its victory the devouring grave;â Heâmightiest to deliver and to save!â HeâRuler of the Worlds!âbeneath whose sway Love, Mercy, Peace, shone forth with brightest ray;â Heâthe betrayed, the abased, the insulted Lord, The Man of Sorrowsâscorned, contemned, abhorred; Who on the Funeral Mount from whence was borne This earth, rent, bleeding, pierced by nail and thorn, Endured of all His sufferings and His woes, The dread, the hideous, agonizing close! Surely the Fathers of the City gazed With pious reverence on the grave-mounds raised In this most sacred Sanctuaryâand felt, While by some well-known tomb they humbly knelt, 'T was sweet to thus look forward in the years Of their gray hairs (when all that most endearsâ All that most charms in Life is snatched away, And gloomy shadows cross the darkening day), To resting their tired bones in this blest spotâ It almost brightened their impending lot! Oh! it was sweet in verge of their decline, To think they yet should sleep in Palestine; For so to them this hallowed field appeared, (By bright associations, blestâendeared)â This hallowed fieldâset solemnly apart For sacred usesâgrafted in the heart Of their own native countryâLo! to them It seemed a rich, inestimable gem Framed, sweetly framed, in their own golden landâ As by the touch of some Enchanter's wandâ And by Imagination's warm sighs fannedâ Oh! fanned by Fancy's soft Elysian breath, It was the very Paradise of Death! Yet fond delusion!âsuperstition fondâ How little might they care, when once beyond The fearful barrier that doth far and wide The living from the unconscious Dead divide, In what sad prison-house of kindred clay They suffered the dire process of decay. Oh! false delusionâsuperstition blind, How little recked the ashes there consigned Of the Asylum which they thus had found, Ev'n in that Holiest of all Holy Ground! How vain 't was to transport then, oh! how vain, That blessed soil o'er the dividing main, For poor Corruption there to moulder in, Since not all Calvary could cleanse one sinâ Since not all Calvary, piled above the place Of their repose, could hide or could efface The smallest, slightest blot on their past livesâ While yet they struggled with their fleshly gyves; Nor might all Calvary, heaped upon their tombs, Defend them from their just, eternal doomsâ Nor stay the awful sentence that must seal Their future state's all boundless woe or weal; Though like the desperate ones, that shall upraise Their voices in the fearful, deadly days, And cry, âFall on us!â to the Hills aboveâ To the huge Mountains, they would fain remove, âCover us!â they should put their trust in that To shield them from the frowns of threatening Fate: Oh! noâ't is He, the Eternal Lord alone, Who suffered upon Calvary, can atone For all our sinsâsuffice for all our needsâ Blot out our darkest, foulest, worst misdeedsâ Bid every danger pass, and terror cease, And gird us round with Safety and with Peace!â That high and heavenly Refugeâfirst and best, Beneath whose shelter we securely rest!â He who on Calvary suffered, bled, and died, With hands and feet pierced deep, and wounded side; And brows, where Love and Mercy beamed, all torn By the mock crown of sharp and painful thorn;â He, who became for us the sacrificeâ Who for our pardon paid the astonishing priceâ The astonishing, awful price, unmurmuring paidâ The appalling sacrifice unshrinking made!â He, the Immaterial, Spiritual, Divine, Who could for us His glorious throne resignâ For us consent unto a mortal birthâ For us submit to dwell on sinful earth;â He, the Everlastingâthe Infiniteâthe Supreme, Who stooped to Death, our vile race to redeem;â He, the forgiving, patient sufferer, there Condemned the bitterest pangs of Death to bear;â He 't is alone can succour, and defend, And save, and guard, and shield us to the end; Beneath whose blest protection we may dwell As in a strong and mighty citadel! Then oh! how vain 't wasâoh! how very vain, To bear this strange soil o'er the severing main, Since 't is the Soul that must transported be, Beyond the dark tides of mortality; The Soul that must be freely wafted o'er Unto a purerâholierâbetter shore, Far, far from Sin's dull, deadly climates borne, Even while it waits on earth for Heav'n's transcendant morn! Still for the virtuous feeling's hallowed sake, Which in those pious breasts did brightly wakeâ Still for the sake of the ennobling zeal Displayed by those who bared the avenging steel 'Gainst Pagan hordesâbe honoured that fond dream; And did our sapient, rational Age, thus teem With proofs of bright Enthusiastic trustâ (Though but displayed on dustâon very dust) Haply 't were betterâfor 'midst all the pride, The wealth of Knowledge, scattered far and wide, Is there not something wanting, which doth mar, Doth dim the whole? Oh! something better far Than high, victorious, kingly Knowledge evenâ Though lowlier, meeker muchâyet nearer Heaven! The deep Humilityâthe enkindling Zealâ The faith in things we may not know, but feelâ (In things unsearchable, unscanned, unseen, But yet whereon we may more safely lean, With all our load of wants, and fears, and cares, Our human griefs, misgivings, and despairs, Than Knowledge, on thy staff!âwhile what we know Remains imperfect and unsound below! And ah! the heavenly wisdom to refrain From things to which we should not strive to attainâ (Things that for us are all too hard and highâ The darkly-complex secrets of the sky)â The uplifting of the chastened heart aboveâ The deep, pure, fervent, consecrated loveâ The self-depreciationâself-distrustâ Without which all is dust, and very dust! For what is Man, of aid divine bereft? If Heaven forsake him, what, ah! what is left?â A bubble on the surface of the seaâ The dark, vast Ocean of Eternityâ That is and is notâin itself a void, A nothing, that waits not to be destroyed; Perishing of itselfâbut made to show How near can Nature to a vacuum go; Oh! what is Manâwhat are the works of Man? Look round, and if ye closely, clearly scan Ay! even his loftiest actionsâye shall find Much that shall show how weak he is, how blind; Much that shall deeply prove and darkly show, How less than little he is here below. Behold the proudest Wonders of his handâ They sink, they melt, they pass; or if one stand Beyond the allotted period, is't not made Oblivion's heir-loomâdimmed, defaced, decayedâ (A mark for stern Derision's fingerâwhere Timeâwho in very malice seemed to spareâ Hangs his all-mournful trophies, and displays His sad memorials to the thoughtful gaze; And stuffs the skeleton frame with that he hath reaped From bounteous Nature, there in mockery heapedâ The weed and wall-flowerâmaking what had been Once Man's and Art's, a strangely different scene; All his, even his, and Nature's, where the twain Hold undisturbed their deep and solemn reign; He seems to spare it purposely to show What all shall, soon or late, become below!) Man's noblest of Discoveriesâsee ye not In them the failure, the error, and the blot? His Sky hath still the cloudâhis Sun the spot! He hurrieth on, his triumphs to complete, But lo! the ground gives way beneath his feet; He feels the iron checkâthe icy thrallâ He grinds his face against the opposing wallâ Still his research, most painful, most profound, Acknowledges the barrier and the bound. And oh! look round! pronounce if every aim For Gain, for Glory, Power, Place, Freedom, Fame, Doth not a thousand times end in the sameâ In disappointment, and in darksome dust. Oh! that Man might be to himself more just, Nor upon mortal things too fondly place His firm dependence, nor in his embrace Clasp dreamy Shadows, nor track every way But one to lift himself above his clay;â That one, the easiest, nearest, straightest, best, Avoidingâby Presumption's pride possessed. Though in the marble and the enduring stone He clothe his thoughts, how oft his hope's o'erthrown! The stone, the marble may endureâyet still His proud desire fail darkly to fulfil: Time, the great Leveller, may not deign to spare His Architectural trophiesâTime may wear, May fret away his polished sculptures fair, Which half a life's devoted labour costâ Half a life's toilâa life's ambition lost! In shapeless heaps thick scattered o'er the ground, Disjoined, shall lie promiscuously around The blocks that once in stately temples rose, And looked eternal in their bright repose; Fallen from Cohesion, and confused at last, In rugged piles irregularly massed, They baffle then ev'n the Antiquarian's quest, And what but Man's defeat do they attest? His dark discomfitureâhis sad defeat, He that would his proud Structures raise, to meet The sunlight firstâ(as mountains do, that soar And sparkle like the Ocean's beam-paved floor; But they hold their high place for evermore)â To wear the Stars as ornaments divine Upon their earthly frontsâas these did shine Chiefly to adorn, to dignify and gild The sky-disturbing Towers he wills to build! And Time, that all subvertsâthat all destroysâ May crush the very language he employs In his inscriptionsâtill the future age Find the surviving tablet a sealed page! Thus stone and marble may endureâyet not The embodying of his thoughts thereinâhis lot Is still to pass, and all he doth shall passâ Himselfâhis Worksâhis World, all frail as glass, For even his World dies with himânay, before; Since who e'er yet arrived at gray fourscore Nor felt himself a Stranger in the Landâ The last poor remnant of a vanished bandâ A vanished band, removed from him and Earthâ From this World's long-lived grief and transient mirth; Or if, perchance, thin scattered round, some fewâ As Winter's path, some leaves of Autumn strewâ Are left, even like forgotten things, behind, Not yet borne hence by Death's black, bitter wind, Either they are so darkly, vilely changed, So much, so wholly from themselves estranged, That he might pass them, and not recognize With cold, ungreeting, unobservant eyes; Or Time, and this harsh, hollow World, have come (By them unwronged where smiles the happiest home?) Betwixt them, haply, were they fondest friends, Writing âDivision!ââLo! while Nature blends Both slowly into one unconscious heap, One senseless mass, bound in one common sleepâ In cheerless union, long, dark, close, and coldâ With all Mortality's preceding mouldâ Writing âDivisionâ on their hearts!â(alas! Are friendships, feelings too, all frail as glass?)â Yea, Discord and âDivision,â while great Death, With whom false Time concerts (who hides beneath His cloudy robe, dark chances full of fateâ Terrific secrets of momentous weight; That treacherous Tyrant, who doth uncreate While he createsârearing plants, flowers, fruits, weeds, And fostering in them all, Decay's own seedsâ Who strives to seem Eternity to all, Flattering them onâstill flattering, to their fall!) Death, Death comes onâin scornful mockery comesâ Beckoning them both unto the place of Tombs; Earth claims the clay, and Heaven requires the Soulâ By different ways they reach the selfsame goal. And while the stern, unpitying Conqueror smites, With his dread, dire, and ever-withering blights, âConfusionâ with his shadowy hand he writes! And 't is Confusion allâand dust to dust, And Earth to Earth must goâit shall and mustâ And massed and mixed in undistinguished clay, Even with the Dust and Dead of ages, stay, In one Oblivion wrapt, to await Heaven's awful day! Oh, Man! thyself, thy Works, thy World are glass, But born, but made to perish and to pass; For even the world in which thou erst wert born Is gone before thee (so himself forlorn The mournful Bard Young. saidâand how truly said!) Yon mighty Orb of Glory over head Ne'er setsâbut set to swell his parting train, Ten thousand things that ne'er shall rise again! All changed around thee, what hath been before Hath vanished quiteâall's changing evermoreâ All's altered, altering round theeâget thee gone! There's yet for thee a shroudâa sodâa stone! What dost thou here?âwhy vainly lingerest thou, With that hoar head, that many-wrinkled brow? 'T is Revolution all!âaround thee fast, Thou helpless, hopeless outcast of the Past, New generations now rejoicing rise, And look on thee with cold, unkindly eyes; All that once charmed theeâthat once bless'd and cheeredâ All things familiar, cherished and endearedâ Endeared unto thy yearning heart of hearts, To which ev'n still fond Memory oft revertsâ Are goneâare flown: ah! wherefore look behind? Go forwardâfollow themâthou yet shalt find! Trackâtrack their footstepsâoh! away, away; Doth Earth retain one charm to tempt thy stay? How change comes down on all, men, manners, things, Customs, opinions, and each day but brings Fresh alteration, or addition strangeâ So strange, it seems a wider, deeper change! With time how many a bright illusion fliesâ With every passing moment something dies; Nature's material world alone endures, And that too changesâalthough Heaven secures Its perfect stateâwhile her exhaustless life, Her glorious energies, that with their strife, Their busy, restless strife, ne'er pause nor cease, (Oh! strife that's harmonyâoh! war that's peace!) Keepâas the Sea's eternal movement keeps Corruption and putrescence from the Deeps, Decay from her sublime and wond'rous frame, Through every variation still the same!â Even this essential principle in her, That hath its own fixed bounds, nor knows to err; That tends not unto worse, nor turns to wrong, But finds and leaves her fresh, bright, great, and strong; Even this, that never doth relax nor rest, Serves more to efface from her immortal breast All traces of frail Man and of his Works! Lo! where some lone Memorial lingering lurks Of his ascendance, skill, taste, strength, and pride, How oft doth she transform, obliterate, hide, Or seize it, half in mockery, for her own, And seat herself thereon, as on a throne! The Activity that never intermitsâ That wakes not, works not by vain starts and fitsâ But still by imperceptible degrees, By just gradations, with sublimest ease, Performs the allotted taskâthis, this still brings, Sooner or later, o'er all earthly things, Change and mutationâ't is the law of all, And ever should be, as it ever shall. Oh, if 't were not so, would not all things be Stagnation, sameness, and monotony? So should a dull and deadly torpor creep Over the bright face of the mighty deep? No circulation should make pure the air, No life, no health, no force, no freshness there; No life, no strength, no freshness anywhere; Creation should be calmâbut oh! not less Chill, blank, stark, mute, dark, lifeless, motionless. And Man, who dreams the works of his weak handâ A hand of fleshâshall all unshaken stand, With gross delusion feeds his Soul indeed, And suffers hope full strangely to mislead! Haply, where flourished, gay, and proud, and fair, The decorated gardens, which his care Had artificially and richly graced With founts, urns, grots, and gleaming statues, placed In life-like groups, broad terraced walks and bowers, And bright, fantastic beds of choicest flowers, She (when forsaken and untended they Spread their neglected beauties to the day) Sets free the fountain with its silvery wave, Tapestries with varie-coloured moss the caveâ With draperies of wild ivy girdleth round The Statues, there declined and drooping found; Fills up the fallen urns with wild-flowers fairâ Fair as the marble roses sculptured thereâ And fresh as Joy, and young as Love and Hope; What though they grow even pale as these, and droop, She hath bright thousands and gay myriads more In her abounding and o'erflowing store; Renewed by fostering beams and fragrant rains Stillâwhile one fragment of those urns remains; And sometimes o'er the fair yet desolate Scene, Deep, glorious woods, a sea of living green, She proudly spreads, and they are whelmed and lost, Like wrecks by sweeping, swelling billows tossed; And she o'ermantles with luxuriance wild, Of verdant growths, the Structures he hath piled In symmetry and strength, in the ardent hope That they victoriously with Time might cope. Oh! hopes of Man! what are ye? false as fairâ But melting, fleeting clouds of painted air! Alas! when things that towered in strength sublime, And seemed to dare the barbarous wrath of Time, As though they were the Adopted and the Elect, Eternity! of theeâwhen these are wrecked, Are overtaken by a harsh neglect, When these must pay a heavy price at last For all their splendid Triumphs in the Pastâ When these, that seemed to claim, to enjoy and boast, While Generations yielded up the ghost, A bright exemption from the general lotâ When these, o'erborne, deserted, and forgot, Sink from their proud position and give way To hopeless degradation and decay, A painful feeling haunts them; 't is far worse, So stern a contrast, such a dire reverse, Than the unpretending equal course allowed To things of meek beginningsâdeep, not loud Their stream; and their endurings are, As their beginningsâthrough long years and far Consistent and continuous, as on base Eternal fixed in lowliness of place They oft remain, as though o'erlooked by Fateâ The unenvied privilege of low estate! Oh! ye who to Italia come to admire The might of Geniusâall its force and fireâ One moment from the temples and the fanes, The glorious reliques, and the proud remains, The statue, and the column, and the urn, Oh yet a moment, but a moment turn; Ye have brooded o'er the Wonders Man hath wroughtâ Unwearied still have tracked, gazed, followed, soughtâ Ye've honoured meetly what he meant should be Honoured and praised by all Posterity. The tribute of your homage ye have paidâ The incense of your admiration laid Even at the feet of those proud Works sublime, That have survived the deadliest shocks of Time; Conceptions and Creations all divine Have held ye Captiveâtill, keen, pure, and fine, Ten thousand quick Emotions seemed to start, Too deep for utterance, in the swelling heart;â Till something of the Elysian charm soft shed Round these, throughout your whole Existence spreadâ Till something half unconsciously ye've caught Of the Inspiration wherewith these are fraught, Even the Inspiration wherewith these were wrought; Earnestlyâbreathlesslyâye've paused to scan Each proud performance of aspiring Man; Each glorious Monument of glorious Mind, Where something more than Mortal seemed enshrined;â Yea! ye've consumed full many an exquisite hour 'Midst trophies of his high creative Power; And past bright minutes rapturously beside The old Monuments of his Earth-scorning Pride: Yea! ye've adored with kindling Soul, apart, Each pure elaborate Masterpiece of Artâ One Monument remainsâ't is of his Heart! All that hath chained, hath dazzled thy charmed glance, 'T was still his state, his dignity to advanceâ To plant a deathless and triumphant nameâ To win the dazzling wreaths of starry Fameâ To bid Mankind behold him glorying rise In self-apotheosis to the Skies!â High, even to uplift him to the Gods above, Through pride, defiance, daringânot through love. Now turn to contemplate a different scene, Where Man not all upon himself doth lean, Nor fondly tasks his energies to gain The meed of Glory, worthless oft and vain; Where not in Exultation he displays His high achievements to the admiring gaze, Nor stands forth to demand, in pride of might, Honour and Admiration as his Right! While ignobly content with mortal birth, He bounds his prospects to the narrow Earth; And, though his thought soars high o'er every sphere, Resigned, surveys his short and swift career; And journeying onwards to the engulfing tomb, Without one ray of Hope to break its gloomâ One smile of Mercy kindling sweetly nighâ To bid its black and brooding horrors flyâ One breath of Love to clear its mists away, And tell its Night but brings Heaven's long and cloudless dayâ By Revelation's sacred Truths unblest, The Child of Chance, Earth's accidental guestâ Still calls on every Being yet to be To exult and glory in Humanity! The wonders of his plastic hand to view, And boast rejoicing, he is a Mortal too! His high, transcendant, matchless Works to scan, And proudly own the kindred name of Man! Turn to this handful of light-scattered Earth, Which should but move the Sceptic's impious mirth, The Sage's jealous frown, the Cynic's sneer, But well may claim the Christian's gaze and tear. Oh! seen by Faith's meek, better-seeing eyes, That through all things looks upward to the Skies, 'T is precious as the clots of virgin Gold Strained in the o'erjoyed Discoverer's grasping holdâ Precious and glorious as the jewelled heap Kings for their bright Regalias proudly keep; Precious and glorious, beauteous and divine, As those pure Stars that in Night's diadem shine. Yes! yes! each grain is precious if it brings Deep, solemn thoughts of high and holy things; And (while it thus reminds of Man's sure end) Doth heavenly comfort and composure blend, With the serene dejection which o'erspreads The thoughtful Mind, that half desiresâhalf dreadsâ That fain to Eternity from shadowy Time Would lift its Hopes, victorious and sublime! Enough, enough is for To-morrow done, Even from the rising to the setting sun; Enough for Man's use, pride, approval, praise, In these enlightened and laborious days, While Civilization's polished sway extends Almost to the o'ertravelled Earth's remotest ends! While Enterprise and Emulation move From Land to Land, to encourage and to improve; While Perseverance and Intelligence Spurn every bound and break down every fence; While Arts, Refinement, Luxury, Learning spread From Clime to Climeâfrom Realm to Realm are sped! While busy Commerce with her countless sails Whitens the Seas and tasks the free-born gales! But, are they characterised by brighter traits, These sapient, polished, proud, enlightened days? 'Midst all we shape and scheme, and plot and plan, Still, still for the Earth, the World, Time, Life, and Manâ 'Midst all this indefatigable stir, This ceaseless toil, do holier things prefer Their righteous claims?âif not, the sagest errâ The Giant-Kings of Royal Intellect, Who weigh all worlds, all elements dissect; If that the still, small Voice they may not hear, That breathes blest tidings in Faith's listening ear, They're weak as the unweaned Children on the knee, Just lightly launched on Life's eventful sea. And Genius, wild and eager, and inspired, With more than mortal ardours filled and fired, If Heavenward points not its triumphant flame, Oh! what can be its hope, its quest, its aim? Ere long, each wreath is dimmed, dried each bright spring, Warmthless its proud sun wanes, and strengthless droops its wing! If by Heaven's hallowed precepts uninformed, Its promised Mercies, all uncheered, unwarmed, The studious Sage from morn to midnight bends O'er the rich page, and still his lore extends; Alas! he hath, with all that boasted lore, Blundered in grievous Error, deep and sore; For he hath fallen upon dark Ignorance In midst of Knowledge!âhe who in raptured trance All Pride, all Self-Congratulation, showed, While conscious triumph in his bosom glowed, The palms he had won, the trophies he had earned, And still to his unceasing task returned! And, while his brain of endless schemes was rife, Alas! even in the midst of hurrying Life He was in Death! and if no thought he'd spared, To this sure end, nor tutored nor prepared His Soul to meet the inevitable hour, Oh, what was Knowledge?â what was mental power? If no enduring treasures, pure and bright, He had amassed in Realms of living Lightâ No heavenly, holy treasures gathered there, To bless his hope, when (like a breath of air, A bubble on the waters, a light cloud, Swift vanishingâto dissolution vowed From its first vapoury birth)âall things beside Melt fast away, dispersing far and wideâ All things fall crushed, and changed, and chilled, at lengthâ The Glory, and the Wisdom, and the Strength, The Beauty, and the Pride, and the Delightâ The Hope, the Life, beneath the unsparing blight, And, like the Prophet's gourd, fade, withered in a Night! Oh! what was Mind, whose gifts were thus abusedâ Whose Hopes were thus repressed, whose Rights refused? Bounded to Earth, and to Life's little day, A dazzling, gorgeous Sun, to illume a clod of clay! And ah! if he who from his fervent youth Proclaimed himself of Everlasting Truth The Follower, Servant, Lover, Champion, Childâ The Ally unmoved, the Apostle undefiled; Who searched all secrets, bent for evermore To unravel and to unfold, to explain, to explore! Who strove all deepest mysteries still to sound, And spread great Truth's immortal lights aroundâ If heâOh shame!âOh grief!âcan dare delay On his appointed and commissioned way; If he can swerve from one bright path asideâ Oh! time misspent! oh! talents misapplied! If he can shut his Eagle-gifted eyes Against the Sun that lives through all the Skies! And, mindless of his dread, momentous trust, To Man, to Heaven, and to himself unjustâ Still the awful Truth of Truths neglected leave, Till leisure shall be none, and no reprieve; The extremest Mystery of all Mysteries pass With heedless disregard; until, alas! To black Destruction's huge and growing mass He's called upon to add his little mite, And in a moment disappears from sight! His bark, so proud, so brave, condemned to sink! His Soul compelled Death's bitter cup to drink! Darkness for Lightâfor fiery thought, cold clayâ The Grave's strict slavery for Mind's sceptred sway. Say, was his Wisdom not an empty boastâ A false light luring to a dangerous coast? Oh! was his Knowledge not even worse than vainâ A fatal boonâa deep and deadly bane? For doubt ye not, that strict the account shall be, Oh! strict the account, which he, and such as he, Shall be constrained to render up before The Almighty Judge when Time shall be no moreâ The favoured few, by Heaven's own hand endowed With glorious gifts, how wondrous and how proud! The richly favoured and the nobly bless'dâ Marked from their race, and raised above the rest! And ah! if these prove Traitors to their trust, That Hour arraigns them, and that Heaven is just. Better for them to have passed their noiseless hours Undignified by Intellectual Powers; To have trodden paths by no proud laurels strownâ To have stolen along, unknowing and unknown! Better for them to have dwelt in shades obscure, (So that they dwelt there innocent and pure) Better for them to have little understoodâ Nothing possessedâsave a contented mood; If Duty's golden yoke they have lightly worn, And but possessed to abuseâbut understood to scorn! Shall Wisdom, Science, Knowledge, then, alone Plead at the Almighty, the everlasting Throne, For Nations or for Individuals?âno! The Voice of Truth saith, it shall not be so; Noâif the one thing needful be not there, All else is dust, dross, shadows, ashes, air; Vain are the triumphs that are but of earthâ Vain its feigned Greatness, and its fancied Worth. If these have chosen not the better part, Vain is the glorious Mind, the mighty Heart! Vain, vain to ensure to them the Immortal meedâ They reap the harvest as they've sown the seed; Yet for such meed what care they? what they've soughtâ They 've found; 't was but to one end that they wrought; That end accomplished, all besides is nought; What had or hath the eternal, holy Skies, To do with or their labours or their prize? Enough! Eternity was not their quest, In their own chosen way they've triumphed and been blessed. Honoured, oh! honoured be the zeal of old; Quick from the heartânor faultering, faint, nor cold; The unselfish and the uncalculating zeal, That sought not glory, pleasure, wealth, nor weal; But only asked, profusely to pour forth Its own rich treasured stores of wealth and worth! The Christian meekness, that could thrust aside All the independence of imperious Pride; The unquestioning, the undisputatious Faith, Whose Star shone bright through clouds of Fate and Death; The enlarged, disinterested purpose, fraught With truth, with feeling (pure, even though o'erwrought); The generous and o'erflowing warmth of Soul, Which, proffering part, burned to bestow the whole! The fine forgetfulness of Self displayed In the efforts solely for Heaven's glory made; The free Devotion, the exalted sense Of things aboveâdeep, solemn, and intense; The impassioned Inspiration of the heart, That dreamed, watched, wrought, and prophesied apart! The holy instinct of the Soul, whose power Ruled it through many a rapt and fervent hour; The earnest, bright Sincerity, uncrost By wavering or reserve; and most, oh! most, All else transcending far, all else above,â The full, confiding, meek, devoted Love, (Pure as the source whence it derived its birth) That makes a Hymn of Life, a Heaven of Earth! Honoured be these things still, and for their sake, Honoured each trace they leave, each shape they take! What, doth it suit us, in contemptuous scorn, High on Presumption's trampling Chariot borne, To mock what our dead Ancestors have done, And deemed was wisely done?âNoâno! let none With haughty, contumelious rashness, slight What their Forefathers did, and thought was sage and right. Perchance those very things we most despise Might be acceptable to yon dread Skies!â Those things we think unprofitable, vain, Might not seem thus to Him, whose boundless Reign Is o'er all Worlds of matter and of soulâ Who judges, proves, directs, and weighs the Whole! He sees the motive which we cannot see, In all its fresh and opening purity; To Him alone are utterly confessed The deepest workings of the inmost breast; He judges not as Men judge here belowâ 'Tis theirs to dream and guess, 't is His to know: His ways are not as our waysâwho shall tell, Oh! who shall trace their maze inscrutable? His thoughts are not as our thoughts â what is Man, Whose soul's an exile, and whose life 's a span? Who on this Earth can nothing call his ownâ One moment full of lifeâthe next, cut down! Be still, proud Man! thy impious pride restrain! Think'st thouâoh! rash and weak, oh! fond and vainâ To the Tribunal of thy sapient Thought Nations and Generations shall be brought? A higher, holier, better Judge have they, To try them on the dread, appointed dayâ To try them then, when thou, too, shalt be tried, When changed shall be thy soul and crushed thy pride! When thou shalt know that He, the All-Wise, the All-Just, Sees not like Manâthat blind worm in the dust!</field>
