      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS HIGHNESS The Illustrious Prince Frederick of Hanover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALFRED. BOOK I. The ARGUMENT. The Proposition. The Invocation. Prince Alfred with the Consent of his Father King Atulpho, accompanied by Guithun, once his Preceptor, and still his Friend and Adviser, sails from Britain to visit Foreign Nations, intending chiefly to improve his Mind by the Observations he should make on various Forms of Government, Laws, Customs, and Ceremonies in different Kingdoms, by which he might be better qualified for his High Station, should he succeed to his Father's Crown. While He is steering from Rome to Naples, Lucifer having descry'd his Ship from the CircÃ¦an Hills, expresses his Rage against him, summons together the DÃ¦mons of the Air, and commands them to cause a Storm, and drive the Britons from the Italian to the Africk Coast. The DÃ¦mons obey, and raise a North-West Wind, that occasions a Tempest, in which the Britons were shipwreckt, and cast on the Coast of Numidia. Advancing thro' this barren Country, they grew extream thirsty and faint with Heat and Toil. At length they found a Rivulet, where they refresh'd themselves, and standing on the Bank saw a Panther making to them. The Beast assaults Alfred, who leaps into the River with him in his Arms and drowns him. Afterward they are met by a Hermite, who admonish'd by a divine Vision, came to seek them: He leads them to his Cell; where reviv'd with Meat and Rest, they held Discourses concerning the Advantages of a private Life, and the prudent Forms of Civil Government. I sing the Man, who left fair Albion's Shore, Mov'd by a generous Instinct to explore In various Realms the Customs, Arts, and Laws, Which Pow'r extend, and Peace and Plenty cause. Do Thou inspire my Breast, Celestial Muse, Kindle one Rapture more, again infuse Poetick Force, that I in lofty Verse The British Heroe's Labours may rehearse: Extatick Bards by thy strong Impulse wing Their Way sublime, and Themes superiour sing. Thou, Thou alone can'st feed their flowing Vein, Supply new Ardour, and their Flight sustain. Now did Prince Alfred, steering thro' the Deep To fair Parthenope, the Region sweep Near the CircÃ¦an Mountains, which divide With their protruded Wedge the Ocean's Tide. Th' Apostate Angel, who commands the Air, And rules th' inferior DÃ¦mons that prepare Malignant Meteors, and in Storms preside, Fire Seeds of Lightning, and in Whirlwind ride; Here anxious sate, on dire Destruction bent, His Brows contracted, and his Looks intent, Contriving Vengeance from infernal Hate To sink the Pow'rs that guard the Christian State. Casting his Eyes from this high Mountain's Head, To view the spacious Main around him spread, Th' Apostate with a quick seraphick Glance Saw Alfred's Ship thro' foaming Waves advance: Rage uncontroul'd his livid Veins possest, And Spleen immortal swell'd his aking Breast; While sharper Fires did in his Bosom glow, Than those in hot Gehenna's Caves below. Then with stern Aspect and indignant Air, Such as, the Battle lost, great Warriour's wear, Thus to himself he saidâPerdition, Shame! Curs'd be Atulpho's, curs'd be Alfred's Name; Against my Throne shall this proud Youth rebell, Elude my Schemes, and mock the Force of Hell? Should he in unmolested Peace pursue The vain ambitious Ends he has in view; Improv'd in Arts and Arms, at length defeat The Dane, and drive him to his northern Seat From Albion's Isle, and with the loud Applause Of Christian Pow'rs advance the Christian Cause; Will not infernal Potentates complain, That I, their Prince, neglected to sustain Hell's Empire; that, inglorious and supine I let their Honour, Fame, and Strength decline? How will the impious Nations, who have broke My sacred Altars, and renounc'd my Yoke, Deride my disappointed Plots, blaspheme My Wisdom, make my awful Pow'r the Theme Of Mirth sarcastick, and their Strength ascribe To the proud Founder of their hateful Tribe? Shall this aspiring Briton, the Disgrace And vast Reproach of mighty Odin's Race; Odin, whose Arms did potent Kings dethrone, Confirm my Empire, and enlarge his own; Shall this degenerate Saxon, who denies His Father's Gods, and Me their Chief defies, Pursue his curs'd Design by Sea and Land, And vanquish all the Powers, that I command? NoâHeav'n has ready granted my Request, And bids me bring this Heroe to the Test; But may of that conceded Pow'r repent Ere all my Schemes are try'd and Vengeance spent. He saidâAnd with a Voice, whose mighty Sound Shook all the Forrests, Hills, and Shores around, He call'd the dusky DÃ¦mons of the Air, Who to their Monarch's Seat in Swarms repair: To whom he saidâAerial Pow'rs, employ Your Arts, and Alfred Hell's great Foe destroy, Raise a fierce Tempest, whose outragious Force May break his Scheme, and end his destin'd Course: His Head with swelling Surges overwhelm, Or let him drive without a Mast or Helm, Till beaten by the Winds impetuous Shocks, He sinks in yielding Waves, or splits on stable Rocks. Th' obedient DÃ¦mons bow'd, and took their Flight Swift as a Parthian Dart, or Ray of Light, And did with wonted Diligence perform The Task appointed, and prepar'd the Storm. Now active Boreas rag'd, and with him join'd Zephyr a humid hollow whistling Wind: With equal Force they forward rush, and share Alike the spacious Empire of the Air. They pass the Mountains, that aspire so high Their Heads grow blue by mingling with the Sky; Then sweep the dusty Plains, and in their Course O'erturn proud Tow'rs &amp; Domes with matchless Force; They traverse swift th' Aerial Fields, and gain Hesperia's Regions, and Numidia's Main: Now with united Wings they beat the Face Of the wide Deep, and rouse up from their Place The liquid Treasures, that extended lay In peaceful Coral Caves remote from Day. Successive Horrors with Amazement fill The Sailer's Breast, and mock the Master's Skill. Sea-Mountains reer their whit'ning Heads on high, And with the solid Alpes the Liquid vye. The Chrystal Heaps soon fall, their Structure lost, Like Rocks of Ice abrupt on Scythia's Coast. Now opening Gulphs and Chasms expanded show The ancient Water's gloomy Beds below; Whither prodigious Twilight they convey, Blending with Subterranean Shade the Day. Flames breaking from the Clouds, and sudden Night, By Turns extinguish and restore the Light: Loud Thunder, Light'nings, Hail, and Floods of Rain Compleat the Tempest, and distract the Main: The Billows sparkled, and the lower Skies Seem'd kindled to the pale Spectator's Eyes; As if the furious Impulse of the Storm, And their own rapid Motion could transform Those Elements, and Heat enough inspire To set the Water, and the Air on Fire. Alfred, who still in Straits did firm appear, Now felt a just Concern and decent Fear: Then opening thus his Soul, he Heav'n addrest, To ease the pious Labour of his Breast; Great, causeless Pow'r, by whose amazing Art All Things did ready out of Nothing start, Thou, whom tempestuous Winds and Waves obey, This furious Ferment of the Deep allay: Compose this Strife, and pacify the Air, Divert the Danger, and thy Servants spare. Gracious Protector of the Good and Just, Thou art my Refuge, Thou my Hope and Trust: On Thee, my Strength, my Anchor, I rely, Pursu'd by Threatning Storms, to Thee I fly; And prostrate Thy known Clemency implore; Living I'll love Thee, and in Death adore. Defend a Life, which solemn I devote Justice and pure Religion to promote: The Dead no Altars to Thy Name can raise, Nor in Thy Temple celebrate Thy Praise. Will God to strive with Mortals condescend? Will He with Man, a Moth, a Worm, contend? Why should'st Thou draw Thy Terrors in Array, To break a brittle Piece of worthless Clay, That moulders of it self so fast away? Thy ready Aid in Straits so often try'd, On which my Soul has ne'er in vain rely'd, Thy gracious Nature, and Thy promis'd Care Support me sinking, and forbid Despair: But if the high Decree has sign'd my Doom, And some low Cave must be my secret Tomb, Still will I trust, that from the deep Abyss I shall emerge to Heav'n and Thee and Bliss. While Alfred thus th' Almighty's Throne addrest, Easing the anxious Struggles in his Breast, The Vessel by the Storm impell'd, at last Bulg'd on a Rock, and stuck some Moments fast, Till dash'd and ruin'd by the batt'ring Waves, It left the Sailers doom'd to liquid Graves. Alfred and Guithun, Heav'n did so ordain To save the Britons from the threatning Main, Laid clasping hold on a long Rib of Oak, Part of the Ship in ghastly Fragments broke: While to the Wrack abrupt they fast adher'd, Now to the Top they rose, now disappear'd: Sometimes they sunk, and drank the briny Flood, And sometimes floated on the boyant Wood. The Gracious Angel, who by Heaven's Command As Alfred's Guardian still did near him stand To ward th' Assassin's secret Blow, or shield The Heroe battling in the tented Field; Now to elude the Snares, and now repell The Force and Fury of the Fiends of Hell, His watchful Care of Alfred did express, And flew to succour Virtue in Distress: Tho' unobserv'd, he did assiduous keep The Pair from sinking, and elude the Deep. Careful he push'd them with a gentle Hand, Guided the Wreck, and shov'd them safe to Land. Thrown on the lonesome Coast in Pain they climb A Neighb'ring craggy Rock, that rose sublime In Air, and overlook'd the spreading Flood; Joy'd with his Fate here pious Alfred stood, Whence he review'd the Toil and Danger past, And scatter'd Ruins, which the Deep defac't: Yet did with Grief unfeign'd lament his Train Of British Friends, that perish'd in the Main. Then thus, his Eyes up-rais'd, he Heav'n addrest, And his just Sense of Aid Divine exprest. Great King, Thy Hand the awful Scepter sways Which the vast Empire of the World obeys: Thou with a Glance dost view, enthron'd on high, The Orbs immense that roll in distant Sky, Beneath Thy Feet appointed Rounds compleat, And at Thy sole Command their Course repeat. To some Thou dost afford, to some deny Deliv'rance, who dares ask a Reason why? Now at Thy Feet, who did'st the Storm controul, I in profound Submission bow my Soul. To Thee, Great Pow'r, who did'st my Fate reverse, My grateful Tongue shall Songs of Praise rehearse. Ye Hills, which rear your aged Heads on high Hoary with Frost and Snow, and Time defy, Ye Rocks, which on your Base unshaken stand, And from insulting Waves defend the Land. Ye radiant Orbs, and Azure Skies, and Thou Vast Deep, bear Witness to my solemn Vow: While I can move these Limbs, while in my Veins Alternate Breath the vital Flame sustains, I'll serve th' Almighty, and the Life devote, Which he has spar'd, his Glory to promote. He saidâAnd now fresh Courage he acquir'd, And felt his Soul with Heat Divine inspir'd. Wise Guithun then Prince Alfred thus bespoke; Since Heav'n has this infernal Effort broke, And watchful warded this impending Blow Aim'd at our Heads by envious Fiends below, Let us in him confide, and from the Shore Advance the neighb'ring Country to explore. Passing the Rocks, they enter'd on a Plain Barren of Verdure, and unsown with Grain, Where on the russet Glebe some Shrubs of Yew And here and there a ragged Hornbeam grew: When they had long their toilsome Way pursu'd, And Alfred no Abode, no People view'd In all this wild uncultivated Seat, To whom for due Repose they might retreat: Favour'd by Heav'n, he said, the Waves and Wind We 'scap'd, but do not Perils yet behind Appear as great, while we opprest with Toil In Want of all Things pass this lonesome Soil? He saidâAnd Guithun thusâBestill your Breast With your known Godlike Fortitude possest: Rest your incumbent Soul on Pow'r divine, And brave in Straits your Will to Heaven resign. Th' amazing Danger we have 'scap'd should raise Our pious Wonder, and excite our Praise, And tho' distress'd and friendless we are thrown By raging Winds and Waves on Land unknown, We should th' Eternal's Providence revere, Submit, and still to Virtue's Cause adhere. Wisdom divine her Graces here conceals, And but in Part her heav'nly Form reveals, And then but to the Few, whose Minds are pure From gross terrestrial Thoughts, and who procure Celestial Habits, while they ardent rise From this dark Planet and frequent the Skies; And to improve their intellectual Sight, Dwell in the Regions of immortal Light. The boastful Pride of Mortals to abate Heav'n lets experienc'd Pilots of the State Oft steer on Shelves, and rashly run on Fate: And by superiour Art oft undermines The best form'd Plots, and seeming sure Designs, Contriv'd by clear and enterprizing Heads, And on the ruin'd Schemes of Statesmen treads. That favour'd Kings, when honour'd with Success, Th' Almighty's, not their own right Hand, may bless, And grant, shou'd Heav'n their Efforts not sustain, Their Pow'r is feeble, and their Wisdom vain; Oft he propitious proves by adverse Ways, And breaks the Plan the wise Projector lays, Who splits on Rocks, to which as Forts, he steer'd, And by those Winds is rescu'd, which he fear'd. The Discipline of stern Affliction's Hand Forms princely Minds for Pow'r and high Command. Mid'st Flames intense Men cast their giltt'ring Oar, And from the Dross refine the Golden Store, Then on the Anvil with the pond'rous Sledge Renew their Blows, to shape the precious Wedge. Artists, who form a Gem with Skill and Sweat For some great Monarch's Crown, their Cuts repeat, And never cease their Labour till they clear The Crust, and make the radiant Form appear: Then do's the glitt'ring Stone its Light display, Confess its Parent Sun, and with its Ray Dazle Spectators, and enforce the Day. The Sculptor, who with humane Limbs and Face Endows the Marble, to adorn the Case Of some high Dome or Palace with a Piece That rivals those of ancient Rome and Greece, Strikes with his Chizel, and his Blow pursues, Till he the finish'd Work with Pleasure views. Thus with his Rod the Pow'r Supreme corrects The favour'd Prince, whose Safety He respects, That he may humble and indulgent grow, Patient in Suff'ring, and resign'd in Woe. Hence Albion's Prince, to ease your growing Grief Trust the great Mind, confirm'd in this Belief, That the past Storm you'll well intended find, That Heav'n is just, nor, when severe, unkind: That by Affliction wise and mod'rate grown, And fit for Empire you may mount the Throne: Then you may Albion raise to high Command, Establish Peace, and from a suff'ring Land Drive Foreign Arms: thus shall the Isle be made The Seat of Science, and the Mart of Trade: Then warring Empires shall in her confide, And she Europa's Umpire shall decide The Fate of Princes by her just Decree; And bid contending Monarchies agree. Now they advanc'd, and by the burning Skies Grown dry and faint, they search'd with eager Eyes The barren Heath; at length they joyful found A Stream with Flaggs and bristling Rushes crown'd, Which gushing from the neighb'ring Upland flow'd, And its moist Treasures on the Flats bestow'd. Here with delicious draughts they slak'd their drought, Their Anguish sooth'd, and eas'd their anxious Doubt. Joy'd with the sweet Refreshment of the Flood On the rais'd Bank a while the Britons stood; Then Alfred ThusâHow should the various Ways Of Heav'n's Salvation pious Wonder raise, That touch'd with Mercy led our doubful Feet When faint with Thirst to Springs and Waters sweet? Ye favour'd Tribes, once Heav'ns peculiar Care, By Wonders oft deliver'd, Witness bear, How, when you panted with excessive Heat, With Thirst opprest, and spent with Toil and Sweat, While thro' the sandy solitary Waste From Egypt's Frontier you to Canaan past, Your Leader did more Power than Nature's show, Made stable craggy Mountains liquid grow, Dissolv'd the Cliffs and bade the Marble flow, While their hard Bowels as they Pity felt, To slake your Thirst did into Rivers melt; Tell, how from Rocks your Drink did streaming spread The Desart's Face, as from the Skies your Bread. How this amazing, this refreshing Aid At the last Gasp did vile Distrust upbraid. And may our Souls divine Compassion bless, That led us to the Springs in our Distress. He saidâwhen in Surprize they heard a Sound Ring thro' the ecchoing Plain, and looking round They saw a grisly Panther on his Way Advance to seize them and assure his Prey. He roar'd aloud, oft lick'd his rav'ning Jaws, And struck out oft his fierce destructive Paws, A Preface to the Feast he eager view'd, And with voracious Hunger swift pursu'd Alfred beheld the Terrour from afar, And dauntless stood to undertake the War. Guithun surpriz'd at this amazing Sight Felt vast Concern, and shudd'ring with Affright Sent earnest Cries to Heav'n for speedy Aid, And for his own and Alfred's Safety pray'd. The British Prince did dauntless Courage show, Determin'd to sustain th' invading Foe, And on the Margin of the narrow Flood Waiting the unexampled Combate stood. The Foe came on, and leap'd against his Breast; Present of Mind the Briton clasp'd and prest With strong Heroick Gripe the savage Beast: Then in a Moment, to effect his Scheme, Plung'd with him in his Arms amidst the Stream, And held him down, till with his Struggling tir'd, And by the Current choak'd, the Beast expir'd. Now to the Bank the valiant Heroe rais'd On bended Knees his great Deliv'rer prais'd, Guithun mean Time, from pale Despair releas'd, Wonder and Joy and Gratitude express'd: Then saidâThis Action, Alfred, must presage Yet greater Wonders in your riper Age. That from your Coasts you'll barb'rous Arms repell, Extirpate publick Pests, fierce Monsters quell, And Tyrants, who fair Realms and Towns efface, The Plague of Kingdoms and Mankind's Disgrace. David, when first young Manhood did begin To cloath with tender Down his blooming Chin, Slew the fierce Lyon, and the shaggy Bear, That ran with rav'ning Jaws his Flock to tear. Thus flush'd with Spoil, and conscious of his Might He kill'd Philistia's Champion bold in Fight, Of Size stupendous, and Gigantick Height. These Deeds procur'd the Heroe wide Renown, And shew'd him worthy of Judea's Crown, Which yet he did not wear, till in the School Of sharp Affliction try'd, and taught to rule: And then advanc'd to Empire, how he shone! What Triumph's rais'd the Glory of his Throne! Sea-Commerce brought him Wealth immense, by Land Proud Syria's Lords obey'd his high Command. Of this great Monarch Ã¦mulous, O Prince, Your mighty Deeds will wond'ring Realms convince, That you'll a publick Benefactor prove; Crown'd with Applause and universal Love. He saidâAnd now the Britons much reviv'd Travers'd the Plain till, at the Foot arriv'd Of a high Hill, a Trav'ller they descry'd Descending to them from its steepy Side. The Hermite, such he prov'd, the Britons join'd; Grave his Deportment, and his Aspect kind. Hair white, as hov'ring Snow, upon his Head Did reverend Grace and hoary Honours spread. His Nerves were firm, his Eyes preserv'd their Fire, His Skin scarce wrinkled, and his Voice entire; His Cheeks a fresh and florid Colour dy'd By active Spirits and warm Blood supply'd; While plyant Joints and cheerful Looks combin'd Shew'd Health unbroken and a peaceful Mind; His Face unmark'd by Grief or secret Fears, Nor did he bend beneath his Weight of Years: While Life defying Time did in its Urn Flame up with Vigour, and unwasted burn. As when a mild autumnal Season yields A second Summer, and renews the Fields, Fresh Flowers and springing Plants adorn the Plain, And verdant Meads exhilarate the Swain; Nature's again in vernal Pride array'd, And smiles, while Winter is so long delay'd: So look'd the happy Hermite, free from Care, And all the Ills of Age that Mortals bear. Then Guithun thus the Anchorite bespoke; Behold two Strangers, who their Vessel broke, Their Friends, their Servants, and Provisions lost, Were newly Shipwreckt on the Neighb'ring Coast: That Goodness and Benevolence of Mind, That makes the Heart grow gentle, soft, and kind, Which in your Mien unvulgar is confess'd, And in your Face in strongest Lines express'd, Inspire fresh Hopes that we shall find Relief From your Indulgence to abate our Grief. A while the Hermite stood, and as he ey'd The Pair, he thought in Alfred he descry'd The Marks of Greatness, and a noble Mind To Glory and Heroick Deeds inclin'd: Such were his blooming Beauties, such his Grace, And such his Godlike Dignity of Face. Then saidâPure Love and Charity divine That Christian Faith inspires, my Soul incline To pity all that Fate unhappy know, Solace their Sorrow, and relieve their Woe: That Heav'n of Pleasure conscious Virtue brings, That Joy, which from indulgent Mercy springs, Rivals the Triumphs of the Blest above, Where perfect Bliss results from perfect Love. Then did he bid them anxious Thoughts expell From their sad Breasts, and follow to his Cell. Ready the Britons with his Will comply'd, And grateful bless'd their wise and reverend Guide; Who thus bespoke Prince AlfredâCourteous Guest, Ease my Suspension, and at my Request Tell me your Names and Parents, let me know The distant Realm to which your Birth you owe; And why, expos'd to Perils, Straits, and Toil, By Land and Sea, you left your native Soil? Then Alfred thus reply'dâAtulpho, who O'er Albion reigns to his high Office true, Is my lov'd Father, and this prudent Sage, My Friend th' Instructor of my tender Age, Is Guithun; why I did from Britain steer To visit foreign Realms, the Motive hear. While in my Thoughts revolving Britain's State I sigh'd, and mourn'd with Tears her hapless Fate, Which of her Virtue, Strength, and Wealth bereft, And succourless by neighb'ring Nations left, Is now exhausted and degenerate grown, Where Sciences and Arts are scarcely known, Commerce neglected, and the Land unsown, (The sad Effects of raging Civil Arms, Of fierce Invasions, and renew'd Alarms;) I soon decreed to leave Britannia's Soil, And bear in distant Realms uncommon Toil, From various Modes of Empire to select The fittest Schemes and Rules, that might correct Domestick Ills, and Foreign Foes defeat, Make Subjects happy, and the Monarch Great; That if I breathe again my Native Air, And should Britannia's Crown Imperial wear, I might by wise and just and equal Laws Advance the Realm, and aid Religion's Cause: Might from their growing Fears her Sons release, And gain to Albion Plenty, Strength, and Peace. Leaving in this Design Britannia's Shore, Resolv'd new States and Kingdoms to explore, (Nor did Atulpho from my Choice dissent) With Guithun and some faithful Lords I went From Britain's Coast; to Rome our Way we sped, Of Christian Pow'rs the delegated Head; Whence while to fair Parthenope we steer'd, And the sublime CircÃ¦an Hills appear'd, A furious Tempest rose, when we were thrown Shipwreckt and naked on this Coast unknown. He ceas'dâThe Hermite bow'd, and thus reply'd; Know, Prince, so Heav'n ordain'd, you by the Tide And Storms are cast upon Numidia's Strand, Tunisian Monarchs rule the fertile Land. Not far remote stands tow'ring on the Shore, By Traffick rich, and strong in naval Store, Their City, where a Prince of great Renown Halla now wears, what he deserves, a Crown; Descended from the first Arabian Head, Who hostile Troops against the Christian led. Long had the Christian Realms lain plung'd in Vice, Whence God's destructive Anger took its Rise: The Day now come, sad Day of Wrath and Gloom, Almighty Patience tir'd, he sign'd their Doom; Then ready to discharge his vengeful Blow, He fill'd his fatal Quiver, strung his Bow, And brandishing his Adamantine Lance, Immortal Arms did in his Rage advance. He call'd his Warriours vers'd in Martial Toil, From Idumea's and Arabia's Soil, And from the Shore that the Red-Sea restrains, Muster'd his Cohorts on Medina's Plains, A barb'rous, proud, inexorable Race, And bad their Swords, the Christian Towns efface. The Arab soon made num'rous States obey, And open'd for his Faith a bloody Way, Which, like a raging Amazon in Arms, Conquer'd by Terror, not Celestial Charms. This Scourge of rebel Kingdoms, and the Sword Of the degenerate Christians mighty Lord, Drawn in his fierce vindictive Wrath destroy'd The Realms that Godless Christian Lords enjoy'd, And triumph'd in their Blood, who (impious Shame!) Abhorr'd his Precepts, yet usurp'd his Name. May Christian Pow'rs, who yet in Peace remain, Triumph in Plenty, and in Pleasure reign, From their Lethargick Indolence awake, Lest of this Cup of Fury they partake. Tho' Arabs much to Rapine are inclin'd, Of Nature fierce, and Manners unrefin'd, Yet is King Halla gen'rous, mild, and wise, And with the most applauded Heroe vies; Courteous, humane, and easy of Access This Monarch succours Merit in Distress. Tho' the great Prince rejects our Creed divine, His moral Virtues so illustrious shine, That he like some, who Rome's proud Scepter bore, Excells most Kings who Christ their Head adore, That potent Empires as his Viceroys sway, And own his Faith, but not his Laws obey. Now at the Hermite's Mansion they arriv'd, A lonesome Cave by Nature's Art contriv'd In the same Hill where they the Father met; A Heap of Turf was at the Entrance set: Hither the Reverend Man did oft repair To ease his Limbs, and breathe the open Air. Low branching Trees with various Verdure crown'd, Spontaneous Offspring of th' unlabour'd Ground, Did oe'r the Mouth their mingled Heads display, And interwoven Arms, which beat away Invading Winds, reduc'd intemp'rate Heat, And screen'd from Rain the solitary Seat. Ten Steps hewn roughly form'd the short Descent, By which the Strangers with their Leader went Down to the Floor, which the pleas'd Britons view'd With od'rous Thyme, and new-cut Rushes strew'd. A maple Table and four Chairs did stand Along the Side, wrought by the Owner's Hand; And plac'd in Iron Sockets, Tapers bright, Diffus'd around the Cave sufficient Light. Two Planks on Tressels with a Goat-skin spread In a Side Grotto, were the Hermite's Bed; And tho' the strait Abode was low and mean, All Things were decent, wholesome, sweet and clean. He then the Strangers friendly did embrace, And gave them Welcome to his lonely Place: Bade them their adverse Fate with Firmness bear, And trust th' Almighty's Providential Care; Who oft, said he, the Heroe's Virtue tries, And lets him send to Heav'n neglected Cries; But ne'er will leave him succourless in Woe, Nor let him hopeless in Affliction grow: Gracious at length he'll hear his ardent Pray'r, In the black Gulphs confining on Despair He'll find his Servant out, will raise him thence, And shew his Care of suff'ring Innocence. While, in the Night that last succeeded Day, My Senses bound in Sleep's soft Chains, I lay, Some Guest Divine did in my Brain convene The Spirits, and dispos'd the following Scene. While looking stedfast on the spreading Deep, The Heav'ns sweet-smiling, and the Winds asleep, I saw black Vapours on a sudden rise, And heard fierce Boreas whistling in the Skies, And lab'ring with a Storm; the Storm ensu'd, When I the Face of Heav'n with Horror view'd. During this Strife, presented to my Eye Like struggling Nature's last strong Agony, I saw a Vessel bulge upon a Rock, And dash to Pieces with the furious Shock; And soon two Shipwreckt Passengers appear'd Cast on the Beach, when I these Accents heard; Go meet these Christian Suff'rers, sooth their Grief, And, as thou can'st, afford them kind Relief. The Heav'nly Order glad I did obey, Went from my Cell, and found you on the Way. He saidâAnd Alfred bless'd th' indulgent Care Of Heav'n, that did this wond'rous Scene prepare To ease his Trouble and prevent Despair. And when the Christian Heroe had express'd The grateful Ardour that his Soul possess'd, The Anchorite did cheap Provisions bring, Milk, Honey, Fruits, and from the Chrystal Spring Pure WaterâThey invited, sate and eat, Pleas'd with the Banquet of unartful Meat: And when their Thirst and Hunger were appeas'd, And in great Part their Grief and Anguish eas'd, Prince Alfred thus.âHow sweet is lonely Life, And this serene Simplicity! from Strife And Uproar free, from the loud Noise of War, And the litigious Clamours of the Bar! Safe from the various Nets, and fatal Snares, That spread the City's faithless Ground, and Cares That haunt the Great, and every Way surround Mortals in Business, or in Pleasure drown'd. Blest were our Fathers in the eldest Age! Ere Lust of Pow'r did Men in Arms engage; Ere avaricious Eyes were charm'd with Gold, Or Traytors to be great, their Country sold! Ere the Voluptuous of degen'rate Taste Disrellish'd simple Foods, and those embrac'd Who taught Men rich Destruction first to eat, And with high Sauces poison'd wholsome Meat! Till nauseous Med'cines were at length employ'd To cure the Glutton by the Cook destroy'd: Ere Men embroider'd precious Silks, and wore Wide Robes of State enrich'd with Lybian Oar: None yet did hardy o'er the Ocean run Thro' Deaths and Dangers to the rising Sun; Oe'r dreadful Gulphs and distant Kingdoms roam To fetch all Asia's Pride and Pleasures Home: They knew no Persian Loom, nor Tyrian Dye, Nor dress'd in Colours Rivals of the Sky; Nor spread with Scarlet lay on downy Beds, With gilded Roofs of Cedar o'er their Heads; Nor did from od'rous Limbs and scented Hair Diffuse Arabia thro' the ambient Air, Or in their Vests Hesperian Gardens wear. He saidâAnd thus reply'd the Reverend Sage; Wise Prince, you justly praise the eldest Age; What is the Man of Royal Favour proud, This Day the Idol of th' adoring Croud, The next a wretched Object of their Scorn, Disgrac'd, exil'd, or to the Scaffold born? What are a Palace, or Imperial Seat, But lofty Prisons, that confine the Great, Where Envy, Fraud, Suspicion, secret Fear, And Flatt'ry charming to a Monarch's Ear, A fatal Brood, which Beds of Down create, Roost in high Roofs, and swarm in Rooms of State? What is the Life of Kings so much renown'd, But anxious Cares enthron'd, and Trouble crown'd? Real Vexation and dissembled Ease, A splendid Triumph on tempestuous Seas? Still is the Tyrant less secure, than They Who frighted by his Might his Will obey. Slave to his Slaves, he endless Terrour knows, And dreads the Pow'r by which he dreadful grows. Since so much Pain and Care a Court attend, Who from this Height of Pleasure would descend To the low State of Monarchs, and refuse Substantial Good, and a gay Phantom chuse? Who would not ease his Temples of a Crown, Take up the Crook, and lay the Scepter down, And to a peaceful Cell would not resort To fly the Furies that infest a Court? All, who discern true Joys from empty Show, And how to live the happy Secret know, Would Pomp and Pow'r to calm Delights postpone, Prefer the Desart, and renounce the Throne. This saidâhe thus bespoke the Briton; Know, Discerning Prince, that these Reflections flow From much Experience of the Cares and Strife That vex the Great, and trouble publick Life; Not from monastick Spleen or sullen Pride, That oft in Desarts, Grotts, and Caves abide: For this delightful solitary State I now enjoy, is not of ancient Date. The Hermite now his wise Discourse renew'd, And thus his gen'rous Sentiments pursu'd. The genuine Heroes, who have Toil endur'd, Patient of Suff'ring, and to Straits inur'd, Reluctant chuse a Crown's oppressive Weight, The Task of Empire, and the Cares of State; Nor, till the Tribes their earnest Pray'r repeat, Comply at last, and, yielding to be Great, To Courts from peaceful Solitude retreat. These, when exalted to th' Imperial Throne, Encrease the People's Riches, not their own; At whose Commands rude Swains laborious grow, And make the Land with Milk and Honey flow. Now do the Schools, (for all great Kings a Zeal To raise th' Esteem of Sciences reveal,) Abound with fludious Heads that Nature know, And to th' admiring World her Secrets show; With Men of Genius, who in tuneful Verse The Glorious Actions of their Kings rehearse. By Penalties and Gifts, by Frowns and Praise, They labour in their Subjects Breasts to raise Warm Emulation, and a gen'rous Strife, To learn industrious Arts, and frugal Life; While their own Cares and unluxurious Course Inspire their Precepts with prevailing Force: Arm'd Pow'r may dictate and prescribe the Law, But high Examples to Obedience draw. Crowns of pure Glory dazling to the Sight, Wrought with more Skill, &amp; with more Labour bright, Immortal Vests, which Gemms divine adorn, Inferiour scarce to those by Seraphs worn, Are kept in Heav'ns rich Wardrobe to array The Godlike Kings that thus the Scepter sway. The Hermite ceas'dâAnd Guithun thus reply'd; How much these Worthies void of haughty Pride, Whom you have lively drawn, by Rays divine Ambitious Chiefs and vulgar Kings outshine, Who violate the Laws, encroach on Right By various Frauds or Arbitrary Might, Enjoy Destruction, and in Blood delight; Or plung'd in Pleasure, and dissolv'd in Ease, With soft Delights their ravish'd Senses please? While they renew'd their Strength by Drink &amp; Meat. These wise Discourses did with Pleasure treat Prince AlfredâThen the Hermite thus addrest With Words unfeign'd his Royal British Guest; You, gen'rous Prince, not Riches, Pow'r, and Fame, But high Heroick Virtue make your Aim. Had the great Monarch, whom I serv'd, been born With those Endowments, which your Mind adorn: Had he the Glorious Ends design'd, which you Inspir'd with warm Celestial Zeal pursue, He had Immortal Praise and Glory gain'd, And o'er a happy Church and People reign'd. He saidâAnd now the Shipwreckt princely Guest Importunate the pious Hermite prest To tell his chief Adventures, and declare Who was his King, and what his Actions were: For such Narration Alfred wisely thought Would the great End he had in View promote; Whence he might judge, led by the Hermite's Light, When Princes err'd, and when their Steps were right. The Anchorite with humble Mien reply'd; Can your Request by Silva be deny'd? But now, great Briton, since the wearing Night And your past Suff'rings to Repose invite, Enjoy your Rest, and when the Morning Ray Shall tender shoot, and introduce the Day, The Province you enjoyn, I will discharge, And you shall hear my various Fate at large. Since panting you to Wisdom's Heights aspire, And by new Labours studious would acquire The high Perfections glorious Kings possess, Who by their Godlike Reign their People bless; My Story I'll relate, where you will find What may in Part for Empire form your Mind. BOOK II. The ARGUMENT. The Wilderness round the Hermite's Hill describ'd. Silva the Hermite's Story. He relates that he was born in Spain, and bred in Salamanca, whence he was call'd to the Court of Pampelune, and made Preceptor to the two Royal Infants. He tells what Care he took of their Education, and by what Instructions he endeavour'd to form their Minds, and fit them for Empire. That Garcia the King pleas'd with his Conduct, besides other Rewards, promoted him to the chief Arch-Bishoprick of Navarre, and afterwards made him one of his Councellors of State. But by reprehending too freely the Errours, which he observed in the King's Government, he lost in Part the Royal Favour. At that Time the Lallites, a Party of Churchmen, that chiefly govern'd the King's Conscience, and were Enemies to Silva, used various Arts to ensnare him, and not only to remove him wholly from the King's Councils, but to take away his Life by false Accusations. Silva was persuaded by his Friends to fly from the growing Storm, but resisted their Importunity, till admonished by a Vision he left Navarre, and passed the Seas, as directed, to Numidia; where he chose this Place of Retirement, and Life of Solitude. His Narration being ended, Alfred took his Leave, and, as advised by Silva, went with Guithun to Tunisia. The Country about that City described. The Plenty and Abundance of the People attributed by Guithun to Liberty, on which he bestows great Encomiums. Now did the opening Roses of the Morn, With blushing Beauty, Heav'ns mild Face adorn: Their weary Limbs refresh'd with due Repose, And Sleep's soft Fetters loos'd, the Britons rose, And from the narrow Cell ascending went To view the Region round, of wide Extent; When casting from the Hill their Eyes around They wond'ring saw a Precipice profound, An awful Scene of terrible Delight, Where solemn Horrours pleas'd and pain'd the Sight. At Distance they the barren Soil behold, Unconscious of the Plough, or Shepherd's Fold; Where no sweet Vapours, no descending Dews Prolifick Treasures on the Glebe diffuse; And hence th' unfruitful Field unharrow'd lies, Of genial Vertue robb'd by sultry Skies. Now a North-Wind did from th' Etruscan Main Rush o'er the Hills and agitate the Plain, Rolling in Heaps the undulating Sand, And scatt'ring thro' the Air the incoherent Land. No Trees thro' all the sandy Desart grew, But Cypress, Thorn, and melancholy Yew. No painted Birds their Way did hither wing, Hover in Air, or mid'st the Branches sing. Vultures alone, that smell from far their Prey, Unfeather'd Bats impatient of the Day, Ravens and Crows, that from the Oak delight To croak by Day, and Owls that hoop by Night, Here vex the Ear, and prejudice the Sight. Besides the dry uncultivated Ground Do's with a pois'nous Brood of Snakes abound, Variety of Deaths, that with their Train And glossy Volumes mark the barren Plain: With active Life inspir'd they bound along, Erect their Crests, and dart their forked Tongue; And while in youthful Pride they sport and play, Their speckled Honours on the Glebe display. Beyond this level Space and spreading Sand, A spacious Forrest cloath'd the rising Land, Where dwell the strip'd and spotted Brotherhoods Of Beasts, that range the Hills and haunt the Woods; Where savage Bulls in Fight each other gore, While echoing Mountains with the Combate roar; Wolves Hunger-bitten howl, wild Asses bray, And from rebellowing Rocks and Hills convey A dreadful Medley of discordant Sound, Which hideous ring thro' the wild Region round. Now to his Den the Lyon makes his Way, Fatigu'd with Toil, and surfeited with Prey, To sooth his Limbs with Rest, renew his Might, And ease by Day the Riot of the Night. These are the only Tenants that possess These horrid Seats, this howling Wilderness. While Alfred view'd this unfrequented Place, This Desolation's wild and wasteful Face; See the Reverse, he said, of Albion's Isle, Hesperia's Gardens, and rich Belgia's Soil: Yet here the Marks of Pow'r and wise Design Clearly confess the Architect Divine: While Desarts, Hills, and Rocks abrupt advance The Beauty of the Whole. Is this from Chance? The Britons now their Footsteps backward bent, And to salute the Reverend Father went. The Hermite, who did still at Dawn of Day On bended Knees to Heav'n Devotion pay, His pious Labour ended, cheerful joyn'd The Strangers. Alfred turning in his Mind The Father's Promise, ask'd him to relate His StoryâThen my various adverse Fate, Reply'd the Reverend Sage, with Patience hear: The Britons listen'd with attentive Ear. Strangers, Navarra is the Country where I first beheld the Light and breath'd the Air. From Vasquez sprung, a Chief of spreading Fame, Whose martial Deeds our Bards with Honour name. Nuna, Navarra's Patriarchal Head, Me, his first Son, in Schools of Learning bred, In which ambitious to enrich my Mind With Notions just, and Images refin'd; At the Spring-Head to drink the purest Streams, And from their Source derive the brightest Beams Of Truth divine, I all my Hours apply'd, Delights by Day, and Rest by Night deny'd. Nor had I Pow'r, or Wealth, or Fame, in view, Nor did with idle Industry pursue Vain Speculations and unfruitful Themes, Empty ChimÃ¦ra's, philosophick Dreams, And Phantasms, which in Schools abundant breed, Cling to the Desks, and on dark Volumes feed. I still, by grave and solemn Folly shock'd, This Tinsel Pride, and old Mens Gugaws mock'd, Which are with lost Expence of Time acquir'd, Yet, tho' false Learning, by the World admir'd. Those Authors only were to Silva dear, Which free from labour'd Darkness did appear In Reason strong, and in Expression clear. I study'd Precepts taught by moral Schools, Instructive Maxims and prudential Rules That govern Life, and publick Zeal inspire, Whence Princes gen'rous Habits may acquire, And may of Minds serene be still possess'd, Not vain in good, nor by ill, Fate depress'd; And whence a Nation may industrious grow, Flourish in Commerce, and in Plenty flow. I thus my Youth in thoughtful Toil had spent, On intellectual Ornaments intent, Till call'd to Court, so Garcia gave Command, The potent Prince that rules Navarra's Land, I was appointed to th' important Care Of the great Monarch's Sons, a Royal Pair Not yet adult nor of the tend'rest Age, To form their Manners, and their Love engage To brave and worthy Deeds, and mark the Way To gain fit Virtues for imperial Sway. 'Tis true, the weighty Charge I long deny'd, But, press'd, at last reluctant I comply'd. While to the Court I did my Way pursue, And bade the learned Colleges adieu, Inward I said, must I my Farewell take Of these soft Skies? This sweet Abode forsake? From these dear Friends, these Walks, these Brooks, this Seat Of Learning now must, Silva, thou retreat, And change these pure Delights, these Charms of Life, And unmixt Pleasures for a Place of Strife; Where treach'rous Plots and dark Intrigues of State, Friendship well-feign'd, conceal'd Revenge and Hate, With courteous Falsehood, humble-looking Pride, Suspicion, Envy, and Distrust, abide: Where fawning Flatt'ry with bewitching Charms Betrays the Man she hugs with eager Arms; And where Ambition by a thousand Wiles Supplants and climbs, and ruins, where she smiles. On the high Trust to me consign'd intent To Garcia's Royal Palace now I went. Conscious, what vast and num'rous Blessings spring From the wise Conduct of a gen'rous King, To Justice, Faith, and Clemency inclin'd, I undertook th' important Task enjoyn'd. Firm I determin'd to employ my Skill, And strive with Care unwearied to instill Notions sublime, and Rules of Right and Truth, That might for Empire form the high-born Youth. Watchful I seiz'd Occasions to convince The Royal Pupils that a Sov'reign Prince, Tho' Independent here, his Pow'r Supreme Is of th' Eternal Source a borrow'd Stream: That Monarchs are his Officers of State Who Crowns distributes, and decrees the Fate Of Kings, on whom He all the Realms bestows Which his vast Empire of the World compose. Thus they possess a delegated Throne, And scepter'd guide Dominions not their own: And hence to Heav'n they must Accountants stand For their high Trust and subaltern Command. Oft I bespoke them thusâI ever saw That Princely Virtues to Allegiance draw More than Tribunals and coercive Law. Justice, Indulgence, and a generous Hand, Are the strong Guards that round a Monarch stand: Princes are safe, while to their People dear; Subjects are rul'd by Love, but Slaves by Fear, Who all inviting Seasons watchful seize To break their Yoke, and their gaul'd Shoulders ease. Kings of the Empire of the Soul possest, Who sit enthron'd secure in every Breast, In Civil Strength, and Glory will encrease, And triumph mid'st the Joys of lasting Peace: While all in Arms with Ardour will defend Their Country's Father, and their common Friend. Not so the Kings, who thoughtless and supine Revel in Empire, but the Toil decline; Who love the Pow'r, but not the Cares of State, Praise the Crown's Lustre, but detest its Weight. Good Kings, 'tis true, unrivall'd Pleasure find, Not low and sensual, but of heav'nly Kind; From conscious Virtue their Delight proceeds, And the Review of just and generous Deeds. Such Minds, that no Man can be happy, know, That wants the Means of making others so; By whom consummate Bliss is understood A boundless Pow'r of doing boundless Good; Who Greatness wish, and Empire unconfin'd, Only to make them able to be kind. As Skies indulgent o'er the Fields diffuse Soft genial Heat, and mild prolifick Dews, That may unfold and swell the new-sown Grain, And with fresh Verdure cloath the smiling Plain: So gentle Sov'reign's humane Nature cheer, Supply their Wants, and dissipate their Fear. I told them, King's use Violence in vain The Growth of new Religion to restrain; Since Schemes, that Men Enthusiastick frame, Fall of themselves, nor long Duration claim; And those by Heav'n inspir'd all Force repell, And triumph o'er the Pow'rs of Earth and Hell. Witness, O Rome! to sink the Christian Cause What Seas of Blood were spilt by barb'rous Laws In vain, while horrid Persecution rag'd, And fruitless War with Truth celestial wag'd! Christ's Heav'n-born Faith by Opposition grew, And by Destruction did her Strength renew; While from the Martyr's Blood a num'rous Seed Of Converts sprung to propagate their Creed. These Truths, in Words adapted to their Taste, I in clear Light before the Princes plac'd. While thus in either Prince's Mind I fed Love of Mankind, and of their Maker Dread, Our gracious Monarch shew'd me great Regard, And did my Toil with gen'rous Gifts reward: At length advanc'd me nearer to the Throne, And bade his Council me their Leader own. Till, greater Favour by swift Growth acquir'd, The Dignity, to which I ne'er aspir'd, He gave, and Primate by his high Command I was acknowledg'd of Navarra's Land: Thus I became by unexpected Fate Great in the Church, and valu'd in the State. In this high Station free from guileful Art, Firm I decreed to act the Patriot's Part, Tho' clear I saw that Conduct would create The Churchman's Envy and the Statesman's Hate; And knew, that few Religion did support, While friendless Virtue mourn'd her Fate at Court: That the proud Lallites, my immortal Foes, And active Rivals would my Schemes oppose; Dress endless Snares, and false Suggestions bring To blast my Credit with the jealous King, Whose Actions shew'd that now without Controul Vice had usurp'd the Empire of his Soul; That Heav'ns just Laws and Terrours he defy'd, Nor on Divine, but his own Pow'r rely'd. Thirst of false Glory, Fame, and wide Command By the destructive Breath of Flatt'ry fann'd, And haughty Pride the Monarch's Mind inspir'd, And with ambitious Aims his Bosom fir'd: Hence he disturb'd the World with fierce Alarms, And vex'd the neighb'ring States with lawless Arms. As sudden Tempests gath'ring in the Skies In Harvest Time the lab'ring Hind surprize, While confluent Thunder, Winds, and Hail, and Rain, Drive from th' unshelter'd Fields the dripping Swain; So Garcia, who at Pow'r unbounded aim'd, No Anger yet denounc'd, nor War proclaim'd, On States unguarded sudden Fury pour'd, Subdu'd their Cities and their Land devour'd: Lustful of Might his Kingdom to enlarge, Before, for one Man's Strength, too great a Charge, Or to acquire by Arms Heroick Fame, And spread the Terrours of his dreaded Name; He sent his Warriours with Command to spoil The neighb'ring Realms, and waste their fertile Soil; Thro' various Countries bade the Robbers roam, And lead in Chains their Captive Princes Home. Lawless from Faith and Justice still he swerv'd, Made no just War, and no sworn League observ'd; But Lands by Fraud and Violence procur'd, To which all Claim his solemn Vows abjur'd. Thus with his Armies he his Neighbours vex'd, And conquer'd Kingdoms to his own annex'd. The Farmer was compell'd to quit his Toil, To wield the Sword, and leave untill'd the Soil. Women in Want of Men the Meadow mow, Prune Garden Fruit-Trees, and the Furrow sow. Towns were dispeopled, Arts neglected, Trade Languish'd, and Countries were a Desart made. To the poor Mother starving Infants clung, And on the empty Breast defrauded hung; While others, Striplings meagre and unfed, Round the sad Parent stood, and cry'd for Bread. Oft the griev'd Tribes did thus their Thoughts express; From all the Triumphs and the fam'd Success Of her great Chiefs, what does our Country gain, Distress'd, and sunk in Poverty and Pain? Can she of Conquests and proud Trophies boast, Which wound her Sinews and her Veins exhaust? We thro' our Neighbours Bowels thrust the Steel, But in our own the piercing Weapon feel. Vastly we lose by every Conquest won, By Greatness sunk, and by Success undone. Their mournful Cry thro' all our Land resounds, Which, tho' victorious, bleeds by foreign Wounds. While thus, to raise the Glory of the Crown, And spread the true Disgrace and false Renown Of Garcia's conqu'ring Arms, in every Place Sad Desolation shews her ghastly Face, The Lallites Faction by their Prince caress'd, Of the high Charges in the Church possess'd, Who with voluptuous Flatt'ry sooth his Ear, And make his Crimes in Virtue's Shape appear, Engage the King, whose Conscience they direct, To arm with Regal Pow'r their furious Sect, Those to imprison, banish, or assign To servile Tasks or Labours of the Mine, Who their erroneous Articles deny'd, Nor with their haughty Dictates e'er comply'd. Now Persecution rear'd her threat'ning Head, Display'd her odious Viper-Brood, that fed On guiltless Blood, and by malignant Breath And pois'nous Teeth inflicted Pain and Death. Profuse of Vengeance, Tortures they compose, Works of ingenious Cruelty, for those Who would not Christian Liberty betray, And yield the Church to Arbitrary Sway. Tho' Chains and Scourges never were design'd For Demonstrations to convince the Mind, Nor Dungeons to dispense Celestial Light, Nor Racks to set perverse Opinions right; Yet these fierce Servants of the Prince of Peace, To spread his mild Religion, never cease To issue bloody Orders, and employ New Arts their guiltless Brother to destroy. Besides th' unnumber'd loyal Christians doom'd To Stripes and Labour, and by Want consum'd, Thousands forbid to breathe their Native Air In mournful Bands to Foreign Realms repair: Strangers with Pity touch'd did tender grow, And kindly entertain'd their vagrant Woe. Ev'n savage Clans did melting Hearts express, Solac'd and mourn'd their fugitive Distress; While thus Navarre by Arts and active Hands Enrich'd at her Expence the neighb'ring Lands, By her Lay-Chiefs and militant Divines Drain'd of her Sons, in Vigour she declines. Mov'd by the Suff'rings of our sinking State, And each adjoyning Nation's hapless Fate, Who knew no Guilt, but that their Lands confin'd On a great King's, by Lust of Pow'r inclin'd To win new Realms, I wholsome Truth decreed To speak, tho' like the Sage I should succeed, Who from a generous Impulse bold addrest The Macedonian Conqu'ror of the East; Rebuk'd his Riot, and condemn'd his Pride, And for offensive wise Instruction dy'd. Inspir'd with loyal Zeal, I now address'd The King, and thus my inmost Soul express'd. As I with anxious Thought have still pursu'd My Sov'reign's Glory, and his People's Good, So, while the vital Flame inspires my Breast, Shall constant Toil my pious Zeal attest. Then artless Speech, indulgent Monarch, bear, While Truths important faithful I declare. Let me those Truths with Freedom open lay, Which close and cautious Statesmen ne'er display, Lest harsh ungrateful Counsel should create Their Lord's Displeasure, and his Smiles abate. These with sagacious Application find The strongest Passions of their Monarch's Mind, Then, as unconscious of his secret Will, Adapt their Counsels with consummate Skill To his own Bent, and with false Zeal implore Their Prince to follow what he lik'd before: And when they see his Empire feeble grown, Betray him to the next that claims the Throne. Thus by perfidious Arts in every Reign They keep their Station, and their Pow'r maintain. Then know, Great Prince, your Subjects loud declare Their publick Burdens are too great to bear; And mournful thus exclaim, unhappy Fate! By Officers of War and Chiefs of State, Who o'er these fertile Provinces preside, Slaves to their Pleasures Avarice and Pride, Rapacious Vultures, we exhausted groan, In Corners weep and make in vain our Moan; While fruitless Accents fill the conscious Air, And echoing Hills reflect our sad Despair. Did our great Monarch know, they often say, How these deputed Chiefs their Trust betray; How by a thousand Frauds and Acts of Pow'r They feed their Rapine, and the Land devour, Till they the Nation's Treasure have engrost, Pamper'd with Riot at the publick Cost; What Indignation would his Looks express? His People's Wrongs how soon would he redress? But we have no Access to Garcia's Throne, No Way is left to make our Suff'rings known. Sunk in Despair no more we hope Relief, No Avenue is open that our Grief May reach the King, we can alone complain To the Tormentors, who create our Pain, And who supported by some pow'rful Hand, Abuse their Prince, and say, 'tis his Command. Nor causeless are their discontented Cries, Navarra's Lords, once gen'rous, just, and wise, Immoral, godless, and voluptuous grown, Oppress the People and disgrace the Throne. Publick Promotions they as Posts behold Of Profit, not of Trust, and hence for Gold They sell great Charges to a worthless Race Of stupid Drones unequal to their Place; While all unbribing Merit meets Disgrace, And modest Virtue hooted hides her Face. Would you this great invet'rate Evil cure, Ease your good Subjects and their Hearts ensure, At your Tribunal let the Vice-roys stand, Who your fair Towns and Provinces command; Let them for guilty Conduct past account, See to what Summs their Plunder will amount? Let them refund their Pillage, and restore Unrighteous Gain extorted from the Poor. Should these, who triumph at the Realm's Expence, And by Oppression heap up Wealth immense, Who fleece the People, and with Rapine fed, The Widow rob, and eat the Orphan's Bread, Not question'd, and unpunish'd, still enjoy The Nation's Spoils, and keep their high Employ, All Arts, all Virtue, all industrious Care Must sink, and sad Navarra must despair. Justice eluded, shall Orellan boast, That, by his Conduct in his gainful Post, The gather'd Treasure in his swelling Hoards Rivals the Fortunes of the greatest Lords? To see his Groves amaz'd Spectators croud, Fish-Ponds well stor'd, and Pleasure-Houses proud Of painted Roofs, his Gardens, gilded Barks Riding in wide Canals, and spacious Parks. The prancing Steeds, and num'rous Slaves, that wait On his high Chariot, vye with princely State; While costly Liquors, rich, luxurious Feasts, And charming Musick entertain his Guests. What Government can long remain in Ease, If such enormous Criminals, as these, Can for Protection on Court-Friends rely, And Justice, fearless of Account, defy? Besides, O King, while endless War you wage, And pour on peaceful Potentates your Rage; Elude your Treaties, and revive Alarms To propagate the Glory of your Arms, And with a vast Expence your People load, At Home you lessen, as you grow Abroad. And tho' your potent Kingdom you diffuse; What in Extent you get, in Strength you lose. Kings, who to gain new Countries long employ Their conqu'ring Troops, at length their own destroy, And while their Arms their Neighbours over-run, Victors and Vanquish'd are alike undone. Besides the injur'd Nations will combine, And in their Rage collected Forces join To stern the Fortune of the common Foe, Drive its proud Tide, and make it backward go. Applause, great Monarch, and divine Renown, Which Toil Heroick and high Virtue crown, Rise not from Pow'r extended wide and far, But spring from just and warrantable War. Is it true Honour Spoilers to employ, Glory to torture, ravage, and destroy? Should Chiefs and Christian Monarchs Pleasure take In conqu'ring Kingdoms for the Conquest's Sake; And not provok'd unnumber'd Troops enroll To waste the World and distant Realms controul? Can Kings, who Heav'n adore, and Justice dread, With Garments roll'd in Blood and Slaughter red, Blind with false Splendor and obdurate grown, Fearless approach th' Eternal's Righteous Throne; Sue to the Prince of Peace to ease their Woe, And pray for Mercy, which they never show? Should these in publick Triumph Lawrels wear, And thro' th' applauding Croud elated bear Trophies of proud Injustice, and the Spoil Of arm'd Oppression and destructive Toil? Should Statues, Arches, Pillars, Tow'rs proclaim Their Rapine and perpetuate their Shame? All elevated Minds, like Heav'n, inclin'd, Succour the World, and not devour their Kind. Heroes, as bless'd Deliv'rers, we adore, That Plenty, Peace, and ravish'd Rights restore, And by their Conquests gen'rous Aims pursue, Guard and improve the States their Arms subdue. To heal the Church divided and distrest, If I the Means most likely may suggest, I would rescind the new coercive Laws, Intended to support the Lallites Cause, Which doom those Christians to instructive Pains, To wholesome Scourges, and convincing Chains, (The Scoffers stile them such) who can't subscribe Th' imagin'd Scheme of this ambitious Tribe: Whence Strife, and Discord, and unchristian Hate Distract the Church and deeply wound the State. 'Tis clear the heav'nly Founder ne'er design'd A Church offensive, nor her Chiefs enjoyn'd, Neglecting Reason's mild perswasive Charms, To argue Sword in Hand, and preach in Arms. Subjects, who make the publick Peace their Aim, As Men and Christians may Protection claim, Nor should Church Lictors, those with Force pursue, Who give to CÃ¦sar and to God their due. Thus to the King my Duty I discharg'd, And my Discourse, tho' long, had been enlarg'd, Had I not seen presaging Marks arise Of growing Anger in the Monarch's Eyes: Tho' when admitted to his Council first, I earnest pray'd that, to fulfil my Trust, I freely might declare what I believ'd Ecclips'd his Honour, or his People griev'd; Which ready he allow'd, and oft would hear My loyal Bluntness with a patient Ear: Yet now not soâwhence I with Ease could find The Lallites Credit grew, and mine declin'd: Yet calmly He dismiss'd me, and declar'd He would to this Advice pay due Regard: From this Discourse, perhaps too free and bold, The King to me grew more reserv'd and cold. How hard ill Kings unartful Counsels hear! How the rough Truth disturbs their tender Ear! If offer'd in a mild and tim'rous Tone, Nor urg'd and press'd, its feeble Force is gone, And leaves no more Impressions on the Mind, Than Rocks receive from a soft Breeze of Wind. But if you edge your Words, repeat your Blow, And in your Looks a loyal Ardour show, You cut too deep, and soon offensive grow. Hard Fate! when Monarchs neither can endure The threat'ning Gangrene, nor the painful Cure! And now the Lallites, my inveterate Foes Whose haughty Aims I did with Zeal oppose, Artful Intrigues and various Wiles employ, And make repeated Efforts to destroy My Credit that remain'd, resolv'd to wrest Silva entirely from my Sovereign's Breast. A thousand Frauds and Slanders they invent, And with infernal Malice represent Me as erroneous and unpeaceful grown, False to the Church and dang'rous to the Throne: Yet unprevailing were their Pains and Art Quite to remove me from the Monarch's Heart, Who still believ'd me innocent and just, And tho' too rigid, faithful to my Trust. But soon I saw the Monarch I had lost, Whose Favour my relentless Foes engrost: And while He lay entangled in their Wiles, I only had his Frowns, and they his Smiles. While thus the Lallites triumph'd, my Disgrace I read express'd in every Statesman's Face, But diff'rent Ways; some seem'd with Sorrow mov'd, And some well-pleas'd my sinking State approv'd. As when a Stag, that reign'd the Forest's Pride, And all the Rivals of his Strength defy'd, One of the Lords for his high Antlers fear'd, Lov'd and obey'd by all th' obsequious Herd, Is wounded by the Huntsman's bloody Dart Fix'd in his Side, his old Companions start; Then from his Presence in Amazement run, And by their Flight imagin'd Danger shun: So did the Men in Pow'r about the Throne, Abandon Silva as a Courtier blown. And now the gath'ring Clouds my Fall presage, Which all my Friends in deep Concern engage; Who, while the growing Storm they trembling saw, To shun its Fury urg'd me to withdraw. Stedfast I still withstood their earnest Pray'r, Fearless of Ills, and resolute to bear, Rather than in the People's Minds create Suspicion by my Flight, the hardest Fate. Thus, to the Will of Heav'n entire resign'd, I fac'd the Tempest, nor its Rage declin'd. My Foes, who long my ebbing State had seen, With double Wrath and unextinguish'd Spleen, My Ruin to compleat, their Blow pursue, And with unwearied Diligence renew Pois'nous Invectives, and black Calumnies, And various Plots, and subtile Schemes devise, Fit to engender Jealousies of State, And draw upon my Head my Sov'reign's Hate. They charg'd me, that with proud Ambition fir'd, With discontented Lords I had conspir'd To yield Navarra to the Moorish Pow'rs, Who now drew near to high Toledo's Tow'rs, Since their prevailing Arms had conquer'd Spain From fair Castilia to the Midland Main. To make this Plot detestable succeed, 'Twas said the feign'd Conspirators agreed In a fit Place to dress an Ambuscade, And issuing thence the Monarch to invade, While from the Pleasures of his rural Seat He to his Royal Palace should retreat; Then seize his sacred Person, and confine Their Sov'reign, and compell him to resign His Dignity and Crown into the Hand Of the great Chief, that did the Moors command. This Charge abandon'd Miscreants did attest, Who gain'd Belief, and Garcia deep imprest. Now he decreed my Death, and gave Command Silva should suffer by the Headsman's Hand: And this, great Prince, had been my rigid Fate, And guiltless Blood had stain'd Navarra's State, Had not th' Almighty pleas'd to interpose, And guard my Life against relentless Foes. While on my Bed I slumber'd sweet by Night, A shining Angel from the Seats of Light Descended swifter than the Sun-beam flies At Dawn of Morning down the Eastern Skies; His Eyes celestial Lustre did display, Mild as the Stars that form the milky Way; And in bright Locks of curling Rays his Hair Dishevell'd fell, and easy mov'd in Air: White Robes, etherial Work, his Limbs did grace, And rosy Youth smil'd blooming in his Face; While from his blissful Head and Feet abroad A rich Eruption of pure Glory flow'd. Addressing me with gracious Looks, he said, Silva arise, and swift forsake thy Bed, Thy Enemies enrag'd thy Life pursue, False to Religion's Cause, as thou art true. Therefore with Orders sent from Heav'n comply Without Delay, and from Hispania fly; Make haste, embark, sail for Numidia's Shore, There stay till Heav'n propitious shall restore The injur'd Silva to his Native Land, To greater Honours, and as high Command. His Message done, the Seraph wing'd his Way To the bless'd Seats of Peace and endless Day. Soon as the Sun's returning Ray had freed From humid Shades the Hemisphere, with Speed I the high Order sent from Heav'n obey'd, Embark'd, and to the Northern Wind display'd The heaving Canvass, and the Ocean crost With a fresh Gale to fair Numidia's Coast. Ramez I chose, who Heav'ns high Ruler fear'd, To me by faithful Services endear'd, The sole Companion of my wand'ring State, And took a Cask of Value, not of Weight. Thrice had the Sun diffus'd his radiant Light, And thrice retreated from prevailing Night, When high Tunisia's Tow'rs appear'd in Sight. Soon with a prosp'rous Wind I gain'd the Shore, And thence advanc'd the Country to explore, And find a Region, where the Sweets of Rest And peaceful Solitude might be possest: At length I chose this unfrequented Seat, And settled here my fugitive Retreat, Where free from Cares domestick, and the Strife, Distractions, and Fatigue of publick Life, My Hours in heav'nly Commerce I employ, And PrÃ¦libations of immortal Joy. He ceas'dâThe Prince his Firmness much admir'd, And much the Zeal and Wisdom that inspir'd His gen'rous Mind, nor did he wonder less At his unshaken Courage in Distress. The Briton then his grateful Thanks express'd, And thus the pious Anchorite address'd; Till the great Being pleases to remove Silva the Just, to the bless'd Seats above, Or, with a gracious over-ruling Hand, To bless, by your Return, your native Land, In sacred Intercourse your Hours employ, And thus to Heav'n a Prelude here enjoy. When I reflect how much from anxious Cares This Cave is free, and safe from tempting Snares, Like the fam'd Greek, who glorious Aims pursu'd, And great in Arms the eastern World subdu'd, I hesitate, and undetermin'd weigh Sweet Solitude against imperial Sway; Unable to decide, if I should chuse The Cares of State, and private Ease refuse. They may accept a Crown, who are inclin'd From gen'rous Views to cherish humane Kind And publick Peace; but they, who seek their own, Should for a lonely Cell resign a Throne: At last to this Decision I agree, Were I not Alfred, I would Silva be. He ceas'dâembrac'd the Sage, and said, Adieu. The Prince and Guithun now their Way pursue To fair Tunisia, so the Reverend Chief, Guided their Steps and bade them hope Relief. Soon as the Sun twice by alternate Sway Had carry'd round the World the circl'ing Day, From an aspiring Hill, which far and wide O'erlook'd the flow'ry Vale's extended Pride, They saw Tunisia's gilded Turrets rise, And mingle rival Glories with the Skies. It vy'd in Pomp and Strength with Dido's Tow'rs Possess'd of old by Carthaginian Pow'rs, Who did at envy'd Wealth and Fame arrive, And for the World's contested Empire strive, But fell by DiscordâNear the fruitful Lands Where Carthage stood, now fair Tunisia stands, Which Carthage like, does Sov'reign Stile assume, Defy Hesperia, and the Lords of Rome. The tuneful Shepherd and the vig'rous Swain With Lays and Labour fill the echoing Plain; Some bending to the Scythe, unwearied mow The verdant Meadow, some the Furrow sow. Some form Canals, and from the neighb'ring Hills Bring down the Fountains in unnumber'd Rills, Whose genial Chrystal streaming thro' the Soil Revives the Plants, and cheers the Farmer's Toil, Which yearly reaps from cultivated Fields The plenteous Crops, that pregnant Nature yields, Whose lavish Births her vital Treasure drain, And load the Reapers Arms with ripen'd Grain. As they advanc'd, new Objects of Delight, And opening Scenes engag'd their ravish'd Sight. Sweet Fennel here, whence lofty Branches shoot, And Sell'ry, each of Aromatick Root, And Numbers more, that vulgar Plants excell, Wholsome for Food, and grateful to the Smell, They view'd; and there, fair Groves of Trees, that bore Choice Fruits, and bent beneath the fragrant Store. Here Orange-Gardens, that at once unfold Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit enrich'd with native Gold, Fair Citron-Trees, which endless Verdure wear, The Fig, Pomgranate, and delicious Pear, And Apples red'ning with th' indulgent Ray, Mixt with the Velvet blushing Peach, display All the rich Colours of the opening Day. These join'd their Sweets with balmy Scents, that strove Thro' Bow'rs of Jes'mine &amp; the Myrtle Grove, Whence gentle Breezes did the Vapours bear, To cherish Life with odorif'rous Air: There Limes in Rows with Branches interlac'd, And plaitted Heads, as constant Friends embrac'd, And twice each Summer by the Pruner shorn, Did the Green Walks on either Side adorn; Whose arboring Boughs a vaulted Convex made, And sooth'd immod'rate Heat with cooling Shade. Thick in the Gardens Pleasure-Houses stood, And seem'd a beauteous City in a Wood, Whose polish'd Marble charming to the Sight, And Turrets, that reverberate the Light, Rich gilt with Gold, back to the Sun convey The Subterranean Creature of his Ray. For tho' its Birth in Beds of Earth we trace, Its splendid Beams attest its heav'nly Race, And shining Lines express the Parent's Face. While these fair Scenes of Plenty did surprize And entertain the Briton's ravish'd Eyes, Sage Guithun thus bespoke th' attentive Prince; These Joys, these Riches, Alfred, may convince, That Silva truly told us we should find Tunisia's Sov'reign gen'rous, just, and kind. See here the Fruits of Liberty ensur'd By gracious Lords, and by fix'd Rules secur'd: These Princes reign in Peace and loud Applause, Not led by boundless Will but equal Laws. Happy the Kings, that thus the Scepter sway; Happy the Subjects, who such Kings obey, And thus protected by a Righteous Throne, Enjoy their Toil, and call their Wealth their own! Blest Liberty! fair Offspring of the Skies! By Thee these fragrant Groves, these Gardens rise; By Thee cheer'd Nature smiles, &amp; drench'd with Show'rs And streaming Rills, from her warm Bosom pours Luxuriant Bounty, spreads the Fields with Grain, And crowns with yellow Crops the joyful Swain. Thy lib'ral Hand the echoing Valley fills With lowing Herds, with woolly Flocks rhe Hills; Thou Courage, thou dost gen'rous Nature breed, And Science, Arts, and gainful Commerce feed. As nearer to the Gate they pass'd along, With Wonder they beheld a num'rous Throng Of People flowing from each crowded Street, Whose confluent Streams here in one Deluge meet. As when in Spring the flow'ry Meads excite The active Bees, and to new Toil invite; Th' industrious Tenants of the narrow Hive Thro' the small Port intent on Labour strive, Then fetch Home Spoils their Wax-works to renew, And fill their Cisterns with delicious Dew. So the Tunisians in unnumber'd Trains Press'd thro' their Gate, and overspread the Plains. Then Guithun thusâPrince Alfred, look around, Behold how these wide Streets with Men abound, The Beauty, Strength, and Riches of a State; Does not this Sight Astonishment create? This Stock by Parent Liberty is bred, For when the Natives are with Plenty fed, Frequent Espousals bring forth endless Swarms Of Youth inclin'd to Toil, or Arts, or Arms. See, the free Spirit, which these Tribes possess, Does in their easy Looks its Pow'r express. How glad they seem! how strong! how void of Fear! What Life, what Ardour, in their Eyes appear! 'Tis Liberty alone that can impart Such undissembled Pleasure to the Heart. What diff'rent Aspects those poor Wretches wear, Who the hard Yoke of Pow'r tyrannick bear! How pale they look in Want of Food and Sleep, While, scarce alive, they thro' their City creep! How abject is their Mien, how sad their Air! Each Face is mark'd with Tokens of Despair. He saidâPrince Alfred's unresisting Mind Receiv'd th' Impressions, by the Guide design'd: And much the wise Remarks the Heroe prais'd, Which in his Breast had generous Passions rais'd, Mercy, Indulgence, Love to Humane Kind, That more than Compacts Pow'r imperial bind. BOOK III. The ARGUMENT. Halla King of Tunisia, coming out of the City to take the Evening Air, discovered the two Britons, who being brought into his Presence, upon the King's Enquiry, acquainted him who they were, and what they had suffered. The King received them with great Marks of Kindness, and afterwards entertained them at a magnificent Supper. Dollah the Bard sung the Praises of the great Poets of his own, and some other Countries. The Song being ended, Halla tells Prince Alfred what great Esteem the Tunisians paid to Poets, and how their Princes and Men of superior Rank endeavoured to excell in that Art; and then asks if the Britons were not so much addicted to Arms as to have little Taste of Poetry. Alfred replies, that the Muses and Poetical Inspiration were not unknown in Albion, and moreover that be himself had in some Measure felt it; and then takes Occasion to tell the King, that if he returned in Safety and should wear the imperial Crown of Britain, he would build Colledges of Learning, and give great Encouragement to Arts and Sciences. The next Morning Alfred with Ardilla the first Sea-Officer visits the Fleets, the Galleys, Arsenals, and Magazines, and having seen a Man of War launched, Alfred asked Ardilla by what prudent Rules the naval Power of Tunisia was carried on to so great a Height. Ardilla's Reply. Alfred returns to Court, is entertained by the King with great Respect, at whose Request after Supper he sings an Ode on Divine Wisdom, then retires, and leaves Guithun to relate his Adventures. The Sun advancing on his Western Way From the blue Heights of Heav'n brought down the Day, And made long Shadows with his slanting Ray: The King and Queen now to the spreading Plain Pass'd from their Palace with a princely Train, In a high Chariot rich with Paint and Gold, Which slow along in State Majestick roll'd, To breathe fresh Air, and feel the fanning Breeze In cooling Shades between fair Rows of Trees, Where they dismissing publick Cares, employ'd, Their Evening Hours, and the sweet Walks enjoy'd. Now Halla, casting round his searching Eye, Did at a Distance from the Crowd descry The British Pair, and thus bespoke the Queen; Behold two Men, whose Aspect, Dress, and Mien Confess them Strangers, and their Faces show They know by rigid Fate uncommon Woe: Their graceful Manner and unvulgar Air More than Plebeian Pedigree declare: Let us from whence and who they are demand, That if they prove good Men, our lib'ral Hand May mitigate in Part their settled Grief, And to their Wants indulgent yield Relief. Then, by his high Command, Attendants bring With kind Respect the Britons to the King. He friendly thus bespoke themâStrangers, say What Men you are, and whence you took your Way To seek these SeatsâThen Guithun thus reply'd; Know, mighty Prince, we are in Blood ally'd To Houses of Renown in Albion's Isle, Where first we drew our Breath; That spent with Toil In the late Storm, our Men and Vessel lost, Shipwreckt we floated to Numidia's Coast. He, whom our Souls with pious Zeal adore, We trust will soon our native Soil restore; Till then, submissive we our Wills resign, And calm rely on Providence divine, That has, to try our Fortitude, and prove Our Hope, Dependance, and Celestial Love, Decreed to let us adverse Fortune know, To break our Scheme, and plunge us deep in Woe. But, gen'rous Prince, while we transported see Your happy People from Oppression free; These flowry Gardens, these rich Fields survey, Which tell what gracious Hands the Scepter sway; Reviv'd we hope your Goodness will relieve Our various Wants, and our hard Fate retrieve. He saidâAnd Halla with a courteous Air Thus answer'dâStrangers, yield not to Despair. Your wise Deportment, Aspect, and Address, Which bright Endowments and high Birth confess, Evince your Hands with no foul Guilt are stain'd, Your Hearts not double, nor your Language feign'd. To suff'ring Worthies I would Love express, Condole their Loss, and solace their Distress: Pity, the Source whence publick Blessings spring, Adds the sure Friend and Father to the King. Should not this Heav'nly Passion's gentle Fire Soften the Breast, and melting Force inspire, Should not its Impulse cruel Nature sway, And make fierce Instincts Reason's Nod obey, The Heart, like Marble, would unductile grow, And hard, as Di'monds, no Impression know. Men undistinguish'd from the savage Brood, That haunt the Mountain and infest the Wood, Would feast on Rapine, and Delight in Blood: Nor would they help their Neighbour, but destroy, Smile at his Anguish, and his Pains enjoy. If Men to Brutes superiour Nature show, To Love and Mercy they that Honour owe, Bright Virtues, that adorn the Bless'd above; And what makes hateful Fiends, but Want of Love? He ceas'dâThe Britons grateful Thanks addrest For these Expressions of a gen'rous Breast. Then Abramel by Birth and Office great, So Halla order'd, to the Royal Seat Conducts the Strangers, where their wond'ring Eyes Art and august Magnificence surprize, Not by the Pomp of Carthage overcome, Nor the proud Tow'rs and Palaces of Rome. The noble Guide did on the Britons wait, With courteous Mien, to lofty Rooms of State: Here, to renew their Vigour spent with Toil, They us'd warm Baths, and sooth'd their Limbs with Oyl. Tunisia's Prince, when equal Shade and Light A doubtful Mixture made of Day and Night, Returning from the Fields sent Lords to bring The StrangersâJoyful they attend the King. When Alfred, now refresh'd and richly drest, So bade the Monarch, in a Crimson Vest Enter'd the Room, he Love and Wonder rais'd, His Presence some, and some his Stature prais'd; These his fine Shape, and those extoll'd his Face Where blooming Beauty strove with princely Grace. Then thus mild Halla with a pleasing Air Bespoke the BritonsâWelcome Guests, declare Your Families and Names, and let us know To whom, this Honour done our Court, we owe. Then Alfred thusâOur Country we have told: Alfred, Atulpho's Son, you here behold, The pious Prince that rules Britannia's Land, And sways the Scepter with a gracious Hand: Here Guithun see, he all my Cares attends, A wise Adviser, and the best of Friends: His Veins from Hebert, still we trust alive In Albion lov'd, illustrious Blood derive. I, to enrich my Mind, left Britain's Soil, Expos'd by Sea and Land to various Toil, Intent in diff'rent Monarchies to learn The wisest Forms of Empire, and discern The Laws and Customs, whence those Blessings spring, That ease the People, and advance the King; That thus inform'd, if destin'd to a Throne, I might retrieve the Isle degen'rate grown, Teach her how Pow'r and Plenty to encrease, And make her great in Arms, yet fond of Peace. Of gracious Heav'ns wise Scheme I thankful boast, Which threw me Shipwreckt on Tunisia's Coast, Where by her Sov'reign's bright Example taught, I may my Aim, my Country's Good, promote. Alfred these Words pronounc'd with so much Grace, And such becoming Greatness in his Face, Peculiar to a high-born gen'rous Mind, That the whole Audience in Applauses join'd, While the fair Sex did with the Lords contend, Who most the Royal Stranger should commend. Now chosen Dishes of voluptuous Taste Were on the Board, a rich Profusion, plac'd; The tim'rous Hare, the Stag, and wanton Fawn, That hide in Brakes, or sportive range the Lawn, The Animals untam'd, delicious Foods, That dwell in Rocks, or ask the sheltring Woods, Sweet Ortolans, and Quails, and Partridge red, In fruitful Fields, or flow'ry Gardens bred; The various Kinds of tasteful Fish, that crave Th' unseason'd Flood, or seek the briny Wave, Or pleas'd with Change alternate Pastime take, The River now, and now the Sea forsake, That chuse the running Stream, or standing Lake; All princely Dishes, high luxurious Cheer, Dispos'd with Art did in long Pomp appear. And, while fair Fruits and Greens were interwove, Seem'd a rich Banquet in a Golden Grove. They sateâThe beauteous Queen the Table grac'd, Near her high Chair Britannia's Prince was plac'd: And while the pleasing Foods they cheerful eat, And praise the Choice and Plenty of the Meat, All pure delicious Drinks, (excepting Wine Which, as enjoin'd, Religious they decline,) Press'd from the Fruits that Garden Trees produce, Pomegranate, Citron, Lime, and Orange Juice, Sherbets and Lemonades of diff'rent Sort, Solac'd the Strangers, and regal'd the Court. Applauded Voices touch'd the melting Heart With Heav'nly Sweetness and unrivall'd Art; Tubes of a various Figure, which acquir'd Unnative Breath by skilful Mouths inspir'd, And tuneful Strings, that speak by Pow'r unknown, And vibr'ate by an Impulse, not their own, Combin'd in Consorts ravishing to hear, Call'd all the list'ning Spirits to the Ear, Encreas'd the Pleasure, and improv'd the Cheer. Then, as the King commanded, Dollah came, Among the Bards a celebrated Name, By great Arabian Princes much approv'd, Who Poets were themselves, or Poets lov'd: For the Tunisians this wise Maxim own, That Men to Letters bred best fill a Throne. Dollah beganâAnd did the Monarchs praise, And high as Heav'n the State-Directors raise That caught the Poet's Rapture, ardent strung The Lyre, and soft or martial Passion sung; Or to the tuneful Tribe did shew Regard, Cherish their Genius, and their Flights reward. He sang, how Poets first the World refin'd, And in the eldest Days adorn'd the Mind With Science, and improv'd rude humane Kind. How the great Monarchs, who with loud Applause Founded wide Kingdoms and establish'd Laws, The Rules of Empire, and the Arts of State Hid and disguis'd in mystick Verse relate: How Priests, exalted Notions to promote, Religious Rites and sacred Precepts taught In Symbols and dark Allegories dress'd, Or in allusive Images express'd; And how the Poet's fab'ling Art engrost What curious Knowledge Egypt's Sons could boast; That all the Maxims and instructive Rules To govern Life invented in the Schools Of the fam'd Magians born in Persia's Land, And where Hydaspes rolls his spreading Sand, And Sophists of the East in Letters vers'd, In Apologues or Metre were rehears'd. He sang how David, who, so Fame had told, The Choice of Heav'n Judea's Realm controul'd, On the sweet Harp with Skill unrivall'd play'd With the same Hand the awful Scepter sway'd, And sang great Actions to the warbling Strings; The Pride of Poets and the first of Kings. The Arab then in tuneful Rapture prais'd Wise Solomon, who Palestina rais'd To wealth and Pow'r, while his fam'd Lines no less The artful Poet, than the Sage confess. He sang how Scipio, CÃ¦sar, Brutus bred In Camps &amp; Schools, &amp; more fam'd Chiefs, that led Rome's Army forth, and far her Empire spread, Cheer'd Arts, and tuneful Labours, with Rewards, Chiefly MecÃ¦nas Patron of the Bards; And how Augustus, of the Roman State The Prop and Glory, oft with Pleasure sate Among the Poets, whom above the rest Of all his favour'd Subjects he carest. He then the Caliphs of th' Arabian Line Prais'd in his Song, whose Acts illustrious shine, In ancient Archieves of the Realm enroll'd, Or by Tradition from past Ages told. He sang how wise Abdalla great in Arms, And fam'd for Letters and poetick Charms, Stretch'd the Arabian Empire o'er the East, And by his Lays his Country's Fame encreast. He sang Almansor's Deeds, who lib'ral reer'd High Schools of Learning, and the Muses cheer'd; And the great King, who his own Odes dispers'd, And turn'd from Prose their Prophet's Rule rehears'd. He ceas'dâAnd Alfred, who attentive heard The tuneful Numbers, prais'd th' unvulgar Bard. Then Halla thusâTunisia's Youth at Fame, By finish'd Songs and Strains of Fancy aim: This common Passion does her Sons inspire With ardent Zeal, and sets their Breasts on Fire. Lords of the highest Rank, as well as Those Of lower Order, tuneful Works compose. Some seiz'd with Rapture, Heights superior climb In Lyrick or Heroick Song sublime, And bold in Flight, with elevated Lays Their mighty Chiefs, their God, and Prophet praise. Some humbler Subjects chuse, who lofty fear, And paint forth Sylvan Beauties to the Ear, Describe the Harvest, and the furrow'd Soil, And fill the echoing Court with rural Toil; Collected Pleasures from the Country bring, And at a Winter's Feast revive the Spring. Some the rude Shepherd to the City lead, Who scorns its Joys, and seeks the flow'ry Mead. Some touch the Lute, and tender Passion move, By Damon's Death or Zara's hapless Love, And make Philander languishing complain Of cruel Mella to the Guests in vain. Poetick Genius of a great Extent We make a certain Mark of high Descent, Nor think so gen'rous and divine a Fire Can ever coarse Plebeian Veins inspire: Hence, when a Youth, for tuneful Numbers fit, Opens the Beauties of a blooming Wit, Rejoycing Kindred Messengers employ, In high Respect, to wish the Parents Joy Of the bright Mark of Favour Heav'n has show'd, That has a Poet on their House bestow'd. Perhaps fair Albion's Youth inur'd to Arms Taste not with Pleasure these harmonious Charms, And, while they aim at martial Glory, praise The Heroe's Lawrel, not the Poet's Bays. He ceas'dâAnd thus Britannia's Prince reply'd; Happy Tunisia, Libya's envy'd Pride! This nearer Sun, and more indulgent Clime, Fertile in Genius, for the Song sublime, Or humbler Strains, is fill'd with Bards renown'd, Cheer'd with Rewards, and with Applauses crown'd. Nor does th' effulgent Father of the Day View Albion's Isle with such an oblique Ray, But oft her Natives catch poetick Fire, Strive with the Rapture, and demand the Lyre: Alfred has felt this Flame inspire his Veins, And often sung his low and artless Strains. Letters and Science I so much approve, And with such Passion tuneful Labours love, That this establish'd Purpose I declare, Shou'd I th' imperial Crown of Albion wear, By me erected Colledges shall stand, And Schools of Learning on the fruitful Land, Where Britain's Glory, celebrated Thames, And Isis wanton run in confluent Streams: Where Sages some shall search with ardent Zeal The starry Regions and the Heav'ns reveal; Some artful Nature's Secrets shall display, While Bards inspir'd th' impulsive Force obey. From foreign Realms my Bounty shall invite Heads of the clearest intellectual Sight, Fam'd Chiefs of Learning, fit to form our Youth, And bless the Isle with heav'nly Beams of Truth; Till Knowledge hence her bright Renown shall spread; And rear to Heav'n her venerable Head: And as I vow to purge Britannia's Court, Vice to suppress, and Virtue to support; So no unletter'd Men shall there enjoy A Post of Honour, or a rich Employ. He ceas'dâAnd now the Supper ended, rose The Company august, when for Repose The Briton from th' assembled Lords retir'd, Who prais'd his Virtue and his Sense admir'd. Now did the Morn her tender Light display, And from her rosy Lap shook out the Day: The British Prince awaken'd, left his Bed Refresh'd with Rest, and as he long had fed A worthy Passion, should he ever wear The Crown, a royal Navy to prepare For Albion's Guard against the Danish Harms, Whose fierce and cruel Chiefs with barb'rous Arms Insulted oft Britannia's fenceless Shore, And loaded lawless Ships with plunder'd Store, Resolv'd by Models here, in Plenty seen, To cultivate his Mind in Arts marine, Then went with Guithun from the Palace Gates; On whom Ardilla, as commanded, waits Chief of the Fleet, the Haven to survey And Groves of Vessels, that at Anchor lay. As thro' the Streets they pass'd, they much admir'd The stately Buildings, and the Wealth acquir'd By Arts and Commerce, where each House they found With Asia's Skill, or Europe's Growth was crown'd. While wise Remarks th' advancing Strangers made, At length the Ships a pleasing Scene display'd: Their Number, Strength, and artful Form surprize, And with their Order charm their wond'ring Eyes. Some with Arabian Balms, and Spices, some With sweet Calabrian Oyl, came freighted Home. These brought the Pleasures of the Cyprian Isle, Those Egypt's Riches from the Mouths of Nile. Some were with Tyrian Luxury opprest, And all the pompous Labour of the East. Linnen by Indian high-born Women worn, And costly Silks, which Persian Lords adorn, Set off with Figures, beauteous to behold, Bright Silver Flowers, and Animals of Gold. These Velvets brought from high Liguria's Looms, Fit for proud Beds of State and lofty Rooms; And those from Norway, Masts and naval Stores, Some Flax and Tin and Lead from Albion's Shores, Or various Ftuits from fair Iberia's Coast, And some the Golden Oar of Guinea boast. The British Prince this confluent Wealth admir'd, And, with a worthy Emulation fir'd, To Guithun thusâHow this surprizing Sight Affects my Soul with Wonder and Delight! If the great Prince of Princes has decreed Alfred to Albion's Kingdom shall succeed, How does the Thought my ardent Passion please Of building potent Navies, o'er the Seas Her Empire to extend, and make her reign Secure by Land, while Mistress of the Main! That I her Pow'r and Riches may improve, Thro' her fair Towns I would inspire the Love Of Commerce, and by fit Rewards engage Her active Youth to scorn the Ocean's Rage, And from the various Coasts, to which they roam, Bring Libya's Wealth and Asia's Labour Home. Then to Ardilla turn'd, he highly prais'd Th' industrious Zeal, that had their City rais'd To so much Strength, such Opulence, and Fame, And made the World revere Tunisia's Name. Then courteous Lord, he said, indulgent tell By what wise Means in Traffick you excell; Th' effectual Laws and prudent Rules relate, That thus by Trade advanc'd Tunisia's State. Then thus reply'd the sage Tunisian Peer; Illustrious Prince, what rais'd our Commerce, hear. Tunisia's Monarchs made a wise Decree That this fair Port, frequented as you see, Should be to Strangers as to Natives free. A Council, from its Province call'd marine, Was form'd, which might th' industrious Merchant screen From all oppressive Arts; for this were nam'd Men vers'd in Business, and for Virtue fam'd. If Subjects or Advent'rers from Abroad Complain of Wrongs by Violence or Fraud From Officers, who lawless Methods use To heap up Riches, and their Pow'r abuse, This prudent Council easy of Access Hear patient, and their Injuries redress Without vexatious Law, and Suits that spend The Client's Time and Wealth, yet never end; A baneful Custom and th' unhappy Fate Of an ill-govern'd and degen'rate State; Whence oft the Suff'rer chuses to endure, Rather his painful Sickness, than his Cure. Th' accus'd Intendants at the Bar arraign'd, If with Extortion or with Fraud distain'd, With Marks of high Displeasure are disgrac'd, And Men unblemish'd in their Station plac'd. If the Tunisians in just Arms engage To guard their Realm against th' Invader's Rage, And then the Foes, their Youth and Treasure spent, At length to settle friendly Leagues consent, The Lords of Commerce solemn Summons send That all the chief Advent'rers should attend To give Advice, what Schemes will best ensure Tunisia's Traffick, and her Peace secure: And by their Counsels such just Plans are laid, As may not injure, but protect our Trade. Rigid Sea-Chiefs and turbulent of Mind, Hard as the Rock, and boist'rous as the Wind Whence they derive their Fierceness, strive in vain A Seat in this high Council to attain. Such rough Commanders would Petitions slight, Delay th' Attendant, or deny his Right; At least their stormy Air and haughty Port Would drive the griev'd Advent'rer from their Court; Would vex the Trader with austere Restraints, And fill the murm'ring City with Complaints. Justice in Ways impartial thus express'd, And Wrongs without Delay and Cost redress'd, Freedom from Imposts, and Indulgence shown To all without Distinction by the Throne, Invite the Merchant to this gainful Port; Whither rich-laden num'rous Fleets resort From all the Coasts, which roaming Sailers know, Whence Waves repuls'd can roll, or Storms can blow, And pleas'd, unload on fair Tunisia's Strand The Arts and Growth of every distant Land. He ceas'dâAnd then Ardilla led the Way To the wide Basin, where the Galleys lay: These warlike Vessels fit for peaceful Seas, A curious Prospect, much the Heroe please: He their peculiar Shape and Size survey'd, And wise Remarks upon their Structure made. While he beheld the Rowers bound in Chains Rang'd on each Side, and doom'd to endless Pains, He Guithun thus bespokeâThese Creatures mind, These Galley Slaves to endless Tasks confin'd, Fresh-colour'd active and robust appear, As nourish'd daily with luxurious Cheer. Guithun reply'dâLet not this Sight surprize, From daily Toil their Strength and Vigour rise: For while they constant eat the coarsest Bread, The Spring their Drink, and the hard Plank their Bed, And grasp the lab'ring Oar, they happy 'scape Rich artful Dishes and the tempting Grape, Which kindle Fury oft too fierce to tame, Deprave the Humours and the Blood inflame; Whence burning Fevers, Gouts, tormenting Pains, Consuming Hecticks, and the loathsome Stains Of Jaundice spring, that raise intestine Strife, And storm or undermine the Fort of Life; These they avoid, and while they chearful feed On simple Fare, they no Physician need, Who chiefly owes to those his Fame and Gains, That swell at endless Feasts their pamper'd Veins, Dissolve in Ease, and spend the Day and Night In Riot unrestrain'd and soft Delight. By constant Labour active Men expell Engend'ring Deaths and Seeds of Pain, that dwell Crude in their Veins; but those, that Life employ In costly Banquets and loose Scenes of Joy, That wholsome Sweat and useful Toil decline, Which purge the Humours and the Blood refine, Pass all their Hours, as if by flowing Wealth Exempt from Labour, and excus'd from Health; Whence in its crouded Road their lazy Blood Becomes a dull unagitated Flood, And like a standing putrid Pond remains A Nursery of Plagues, and Hoard of Pains. These Sons of Pleasure, tho' the Slaves are bound In softer Chains, in a worse State are found Than those that fetter'd in the Galley row, Who, tho' less Joy, more Health and Vigour know; And by their Labour Strength athletick keep, Active their Limbs, and undisturb'd their Sleep: Sharpen'd with Toil, their Hunger makes them eat Hard Bread, with sweeter Relish than the Great Taste their rich Sauces and high-season'd Meat: And hence that State of Life wise Men would crave, In which the Prince is blended with the Slave; The Prince's Pow'r, who Luxury disdains, And the Slave's Temp'rance, but without his Chains. He saidâAnd now the Prince Ardilla asks For what black Crimes to these laborious Tasks Those Wretches were condemn'dâThe Lord reply'd, These Men by Halla's equal Judges try'd, Some Thieves and Robbers were, some Houses fir'd, Some, a Ship's Crew, against their Chief conspir'd. These stung with Envy and immortal Hate, Defam'd and blacken'd Councellours of State, Nor spar'd the indulgent King himself; and those Held trait'rous Commerce with Tunisia's Foes: Some with seditious Lyes the Realm inflam'd, Poison'd the People, and at Uproar aim'd. For various Crimes of this enormous Kind, The Slaves you see to Hardships are confin'd. But Court Resentment, arbitrary Will, And State Caprice these Galleys never fill. For none till heard and try'd, and not before Their Guilt is prov'd, in Fetters ply the Oar. No erring Sect, who our great Prophet's Laws Expound amiss, are for Religion's Cause, If in the State they no Dissention breed, Taught in the Galleys to reform their Creed. Our Prince ne'er Arms one favour'd Sect to make Others their Victims for Opinion's Sake: Nor does he Christians banish or destroy, But they religious Liberty enjoy, While to the Laws they due Obedience show, No Faction feed, nor Seeds of Discord sow. We never Threats or Pow'r compulsive use Belief and Truth celestial to infuse. Can Pains and Prisons Errour's Force controul, And the chain'd Body loose the fetter'd Soul? In vain the Slave, to set his Notions right, Is doom'd to delve in Mines and dig for Light. In vain Sectarians for Instruction lye Stretch'd on the Wheel, where Malefactors dye. And now they view'd erected near the Shores The Ars'nals, Magazines, and naval Stores. Here Wealth immense of Pitch and unctious Tar Requir'd alike for Ships of Trade and War, The fiery Product of Norwegia's Snows, And Piles of Hemp and Flax congested rose. Cables in Rings, like vast Sea-Serpents, roll'd Their twisted Lengths voluminous enfold. There Bars of Iron dug with endless Pains, Finlandia's Entrails, and cold Swecia's Veins, A far more useful Oar exchang'd for Gold, And for Delights to Southern Regions sold, Heap'd up they saw, then view'd with wond'ring Eyes Hot Furnaces, whence black Eruptions rise Of fiery Sparks and Smoak in Air sublime, That from the Mouths of those Volcano's climb, Which with athletick Labour roar, around Rebellowing Rocks and Shores uphold the Sound. Unnumber'd Anchors of prodigious Weight, That shew'd the Strength and Riches of the State, Rang'd in long Order near the Forges lay, Forges, like those, where (so old Poets say,) Sicilian Smiths, besmear'd with Soot and Sweat In trembling Caves, to form their Works repeat Cyclopian Blows, and with gigantick Toil Shake Ãtna's Roots, and make the Ocean boil. And next they view'd Tunisia's Royal Docks Secure by Art, as if begirt with Rocks, Some wet and wide, which high-rais'd Sluices save From the fierce Insult of the breaking Wave, While thro' their opening Gates tall Ships advance Like Castles rigg'd, and on the Ocean dance; Some dry, where Shipwrights with redoubled Strokes Hew the rude Pines, and form th' unfashion'd Oaks. Some join the Planks, some with a vig'rous Blow Drive in long Iron Pins, some Pitch and Tow To fill the Chinks, while Hills and Shores around Repeat the Toil, and propagate the Sound. A Ship of War new-built in one of these, Appear'd compleat, and ready for the Seas, And now was launch'd: So Halla had exprest His Royal Will, to please his princely Guest. This to effect a thousand active Hands Were now employ'd, soon from her loosen'd Bands The Vessel freed, did from her Cradle start, That in her Structure shew'd consummate Art; Nor Tyre, nor Rhodes such Models could invent, Not rocking once or rolling, off she went Smooth as the swift-finn'd Racers of the Flood, And plung'd amidst the Waves a floating Wood: This Ship of War for Strength and Beauty fam'd, In Honour of the Prince was Alfred nam'd. Courteous Ardilla now the Heroe brought To his own House of Pleasure not remote, That overlook'd at once Tunisia's Plain, And open'd to their View th' Etruscan Main. The British Prince here, tir'd with Labour, met A grateful Banquet in just Order set: The Meats were choice, and exquisitely drest, An elegant, tho' not a pompous Feast. Alfred his Drought and craving Hunger eas'd With tasteful Meats and gen'rous Drinks, and pleas'd With wise Discourses from th' Occasion rais'd, Thank'd the Tunisian, and the Banquet prais'd. The Solar Orb declining now displays A Face more ample, but less splendid Rays, When Alfred reconducted to the Court Applauded to the King Tunisia's Port; The num'rous Fleets, and unexhausted Stores; That fill'd the Magazines along the Shores. Then offer'd various Questions, which relate To the swift Growth of this puissant State, Curious the prudent Laws and Rules to know Whence so much Strength, such Peace, and Plenty flow. Th' indulgent Monarch grants what he desir'd, And spoke to all the Subjects he requir'd, Their Statutes, Manners, Rites, and Customs told, And did their Scheme of Government unfold. Now was the Supper in long Order plac'd, In princely Pomp and Plenty not surpass'd; The august Assembly sit, and chearful eat The various Dishes of luxurious Meat, While Silver Cups and Chalices of Gold Of Size capacious, and with Figures bold Emboss'd, and with delicious Liquors crown'd, Tunisia's tasteful Growth, went joyful round. Soft Instruments with Strings of diff'rent Kind, And diff'rent Voices in sweet Consort join'd With as melodious Rapture sooth'd the Ear, As what the Night before improv'd the Chear. Dollah again did in exalted Verse Arabia's Heroes mighty Deeds rehearse: He sang their Princes Great in Peace and Arms, And not less honour'd for poetick Charms. The Banquet finish'd, to a Room of State The Court retir'd, the Queen and Halla sate, And Alfred near, whom thus the King address'd; Since you your tuneful Genius have express'd, Indulge our Passion, and the Pleasure raise Of this Assembly by your happy Lays. Nor did Britannia's Prince the Task decline, But took the Lyre, and sung this Song Divine. To blissful Heav'n I'll stretch the soaring Wing, By strong Celestial Rapture urg'd to sing The boundless Knowledge of th' Eternal King. But while this Flight I meditate, around What wond'rous Heights untry'd, what Depths profound Affright my Soul! what Gloom, what trackless Ways Awful appear in Wisdom's sacred Maze! Ye wise, ye intellectual Lights, that guide Enquiring Heads; ye Masters, who preside O'er Learning's Schools; ye Oracles of State, Who reason strong and triumph in Debate; And you blest Minds without a Blemish bright, Of piercing, clear and comprehensive Sight, Tell how you are bewilder'd, how distress'd, How with the vast unequal Task oppress'd, When you thro' Wisdom's Empire urge your Flight, Trace her dark Windings, search th' Abyss of Light, And strive with too much Day, or too much Night. All Things, Great King, Thou see'st, who art all Mind, An intellectual Nature unconfin'd: From thy bright Palace, that sublime outvies The most aspiring Turrets of the Skies, Thou view'st thy vast Creation round Thee spread, On which thy Feet as on a Footstool tread. With Ease thy clear all-penetrating Eye Nature's remotest Frontier can descry, And with a Glance is able to survey The num'rous Worlds, which thy sole Nod obey. Thou mak'st the secret Chambers of the Deep Thy Walks, where peaceful ancient Waters sleep, And searchest dark unfathom'd Caves beneath, Hell's gloomy Prison's, and the Tracts of Death: The pond'rous Shades of subterranean Night, That guard the Center from th' Approach of Light, Where not a darted Sun-beam can intrude, Cannot thy bright unbounded Eye elude. The vast Extent of Possibility Is clearly view'd, and only view'd by Thee. Thou must all Creatures know, who in thy Mind Do'st all their Models and Idea's find: Millions of Beings in thy Breast remain, Beings, which ne'er Existence will attain, That Space immense yet unemploy'd might fill; The Objects of thy Pow'r, but not thy Will. It comes alone from thy divine Decree, That what is possible shall actual be, Thy Purpose is the Spring of all Futurity. Thou see'st the Tide of Time come rolling on, And Days and Years, ere yet they are begun, Ascending from Duration's deep Abyss, Which their appointed Order never miss. Thou view'st succeeding Ages with a Glance, And see'st how in their Turns they all advance; Who on this Stage shall enter, as of old They stand in Heav'n's unchang'd Decrees enroll'd. Thou know'st how every Man will act his Part, Who Virtue's heav'nly Precepts will assert, And who abandon blest Religion's Cause, And aim at Wealth and a vain World's Applause. Thou with unerring Prospect dost foresee How a free Agent shall determin'd be; Contingency to us is Certainty to Thee. Thou know'st the secret Biass of the Will, For Thou, who mad'st the Springs with so much Skill, The Passion see'st by which it is inclin'd, And view'st the various Motions of the Mind. Thou only can'st the wond'rous Links descry That Minds unbody'd to a Body tye. Thy peircing Eye th' elastick Spring surveys By which the beating vital Engine plays, And thro' arterial Tubes mechanick Life conveys. Thou only secret Nature can'st pursue, And her entire Oeconomy review, How she performs with undiscover'd Art A diff'rent Task in every diff'rent Part, How active Ferments work the fluid Mass, How thro' their Strainers various Humours pass, How all the noxious Juices are expell'd, And by what Skill the Wholsome are withheld. Thou see'st from whence her Colours Fancy takes, Of what Materials she her Pencil makes By which she paints her Scenes with such Applause, And in the Brain ten thousand Landskips draws. The Cells, and little Lodgings, Thou canst see In Mem'ry's Hoards and secret Treasury; Dost the dark Cave of each Idea spy, And see'st how rang'd the crouded Lodgers lye; How some, when beckon'd by the Soul, awake, While peaceful Rest their uncall'd Neighbours take. Thou know'st the downy Chains that softly bind Our slumb'ring Sense, when waiting Objects find No Avenue left open to the Mind. Mean Time thou see'st how guideless Spirits play, And mimick o'er in Dreams the busy Day, With pleasant Scenes and Figures entertain, Or with their monstrous Mixtures fright the Brain. Thou know'st the secret Soul's imperial Throne Surrounded with thick Darkness, like thy own, Where she to all the Senses Audience gives, Appoints their Tasks, their Messages receives, And passes Judgement in her Sov'reign Court On every Envoy's true or false Report; How her sole Nod our Motions does controul, And guide the various Parts to serve the Whole; Can'st say what diff'rent Turns the Spirits take, When they of diff'rent Kinds Impressions make; What vital Springs those Spirits in their Flight Strike to cause Torment, what to give Delight; Can'st tell the Manner how the Actors move, When they excite our Anger or our Love, By what Contrivance and mechanick Art Our Passions interrupt the beating Heart; How they encrease the vital Lab'rour's Toil, When they constrain the Blood to freeze or boil; Whence martial Ardour warms the Heroe's Breast, How shiv'ring Fears th' arterial Flood arrest; How active Joy dilates the swelling Veins, And Shame the modest Face with Blushes stains: Thou know'st these Secrets, and ten thousand more, Which narrow-sighted Man can ne'er explore, Who to a high Conceit of Wit arrives, Yet knows not how he thinks, or moves, or lives, Exhaustless Source of Light! from Thee proceed The Streams of Science, that diffusive feed The intellectual World, and plenteous flow On all blest Minds above, and Men below. Thou do'st the Soul with curious Arts inspire, Knowledge, by Thee instructed, Schools acquire: By Thee the Bards to Heav'n direct their Flight, View the bright Orbs, and range the Fields of Light, Climb Empyrean Heights, and hardy soar In Ether heav'nly Empires to explore, And from the Chrystal Convex of the Sky The vast Immense, and vacant Gulphs descry, That stretching far beyond Creation lye. Thou guid'st the Pencil in the Painter's Hand, Sculptors the Chizel by thy Aid command; While Skill and Wisdom are by Thee instill'd To rear the Palace, and the Castle build, To form the Ship with wond'rous Skill design'd To float on Waves and catch the breathing Wind, Which by the Impulse of the active Gale That swells the heaving Bosom of the Sail Starts from the Port, and o'er the Ocean flies, Bounds on the foaming Main and sweeps the Skies: By these the Isles and sever'd Realms are joyn'd, And mutual Gain by mutual Commerce find. Great King, no Limits can thy Being bound, No Place is vacant of th' Almighty found: In every Rock and each unpractis'd Seat Oppress'd with too much Cold or too much Heat, In ev'ry subterranean dark Recess, Each Forest and unpeopled Wilderness, In ev'ry shining Orb that rolls on high, And the waste Field of intervening Sky, Thou art, or rather they are all in Thee. No lonesome Cell is from thy Presence free: Above the Heav'ns, below the deepest Waves, The Courts of Death, and Hell's remotest Caves, Beyond the Gulphs, where dissipated Day Loses at length its dim expiring Ray, Is thy Abode; all Space is fill'd by Thee, If Space be not the same with thy Immensity. He ceas'dâAnd Halla much the Subject prais'd, And much the Song the Monarch's Wonder rais'd! Justly, he said, wise Briton, we admire Your tuneful Numbers, and th' impulsive Fire That gives this Inspiration to your Veins, And urges to sublime Celestial Strains: Great are the Instincts which your Choice incline To ease your Rapture on such Themes Divine, And soar on high, while the Great Pow'r you praise, And spread his Glory in seraphick Lays. Besides your gen'rous Purpose I applaud, That, when from various Toils sustain'd Abroad You shall regain Britannia, you will found High Schools; where Science, with Applauses crown'd And chear'd with princely Bounty, may reside, And boast superiour Fame with worthy Pride; With clearest Lights may British Youth refine, And in her high-rais'd Orb to distant Nations shine. Then he continu'd thusâIllustrious Guest, Recite your various Fate at my Request, Since first you chose to leave your native Land, Till Shipwreckt you were cast on Libya's Strand. Alfred reply'dâIndulgent King, consent That, much with Care and much with Labour spent, I may for due refreshing Rest retire, While Guithun will perform what you require. The Prince withdrewâIntent th' Assembly waits, While Guithun past Adventures thus relates. BOOK IV. The ARGUMENT. Guithun, as requested by King Halla, begins the Narration of Alfred's Adventures. He relates how the Prince, to qualify himself for the Government and Protection of his Country, (should he ever succeed to the Crown,) sailed from Britain to visit foreign Nations, where he might observe the best Models, and collect the wisest Maxims of Civil Societies. He tells how they crost the Seas to Antwerp, and then pass'd to Agrippina or Collogne. The Character of Raman the cruel and tyrannical Prince of that Country, and his unhappy Fate. Hence Alfred passes thro' Germany to Italy. The Description of the Alps, and the various Appearances of Nature in those Hills. The Prince arrives at Rome, is received with great Kindness by Pope Leo. The City described. The Pope from an uncommon Esteem, resolves to crown Alfred King of Britain in due Succession to his Father Atulpho. The Coronation described. The Prelate Labot's Harangue upon that solemn Occasion. The Pope and Alfred, when the Ceremonies were ended, return from the Church to the Palace, where a magnificent Supper was prepared for them. After the Time for publick Rejoycings was expired, Prince Alfred, to pursue his Design of visiting various Countries, takes his Leave of the Pope, who gives him his Benediction, with Marks of tender Affection; and advises him how to behave himself while Abroad, and how to govern when he returned Home. Alfred departs from Rome, and embarks at Ostia for Naples. Ostia and the Italian Coast described, as far as the CircÃ¦an Hills, where, the Tempest rose, that cast them Shipwreckt on the Shore of Numidia. Here an Anchorite admonished by a Vision, met, received, and refreshed the Britons, and directed them to King Halla's Court. Long Scandinavia's military Swarms Insulted Albion's Realm with barb'rous Arms, And on her Coasts with Troops recruited pour'd Fresh Force and Fury, and the Land devour'd: While vers'd in Hardship, and in Pillage bold, They pass'd thro' fenceless Cities uncontroul'd. Britain, her Blood and Treasure spilt, no more Could drive the lawless Robbers from her Shore, Nor to her harrass'd Natives Peace restore. Alfred with num'rous princely Virtues bright, The People's Darling and the Court's Delight, With mournful Eyes oft view'd Britannia's State, Pity'd her Suff'rings, and bewail'd her Fate: Nor did he silent and unactive grieve, But form'd wise Schemes her Honour to retrieve, And strove by various Efforts to inspire A gen'rous Zeal, and set her Sons on Fire Celestial Virtue to pursue, and aim At Albion's Greatness, and Heroick Fame. But the prevailing Dane was not suppress'd, Nor Britain's painful Grievances redress'd, Till Alfred, who had ne'er before encas'd His Limbs in Steel nor martial Danger fac'd, Forsook the gameful Wood, and took the Field, Renounc'd the Huntsman's Silvan Arms, to wield The batt'ling Warriour's; and, by Wonders shown Of Conduct, Strength, and Courage yet unknown, The Heroe three unrivall'd Conquests gain'd, Broke the proud Foe, and barb'rous Rage restrain'd. Thus the brave Briton triumph'd o'er the Dane, And by his Sword remov'd Britannia's Bane, Forcing the vanquish'd Spoilers to retreat From the glad Isle, and seek their Northern Seat. Now, the freed Land refresh'd with Peace and Ease, The Pious Prince decreed to pass the Seas, That he in Foreign Realms the Arts might know Customs and Laws whence Wealth and Empire grow, And that new Science might adorn his Mind To heav'nly Truth and glorious Deeds inclin'd. Blest by the King, he, fair Britannia's Pride, Augusta left, and sailing down the Tide Of spreading Thames, soon the wide Ocean crost, Borne by auspicious Gales to Belgia's Coast. We soon sublime Andverpia's Haven gain'd, And there for due Repose some Days remain'd: Alfred the Domes and Palaces admir'd, Whose gilded Turrets high to Heav'n aspir'd, Which to the Sun his borrow'd Light repay, Diffusing thro' the Skies redoubled Day. When he the Port and Vessels had survey'd, And Magazines where naval Stores were laid, Had learn'd their Strength, their Manners, &amp; their Laws, And what their Pain and Pleasure chiefly cause, Their Courts of Justice, and their Burse had view'd, And all Things curious; Alfred thence pursu'd His Way direct to Agrippina's Gates, The beauteous Head of the rich Vbian States. Her Tow'rs, that wide Germania's Piles outshine, Adorn the Margin of the spreading Rhine. The Roman Empress, who imperious sway'd The stupid Monarch whom the World obey'd, That gave to Nero Birth, a fiery Brand, And rais'd the Monster to Supreme Command, Fond of her native Soil to such Renown, At vast Expence, advanc'd this favour'd Town; Where Raman held his Court, a potent Lord For Pride despis'd, and for black Crimes abhorr'd. His cruel Hand a Rod, of Iron made, And not a Ruler's gracious Scepter, sway'd. By various Deaths the Guiltless he destroy'd, And, pleas'd with Slaughter, Cruelty enjoy'd. He reap'd the Harvest, seiz'd the Parmer's Grain, The Artist's Labour, and the Merchant's Gain: Deaf to their earnest Cries, and humble Pray'r, He mock'd with savage Mirth their sad Despair: Told them that, wanton with Abundance grown, They press'd for Grants exorbitant the Throne: Bade them return and till the fertile Field, Which would enough for peaceful Subjects yield; That Idleness, not Misery and Pain, And Pride and Fulness made them still complain. These rigid Ways, and violent Abuse Of regal Pow'r, seditious Heats produce, Clandestine Plots and open Murmurs form, Murmurs the Prelude to a publick Storm. The States impatient of th' oppressive Yoke The yielding Fetters of Allegiance broke, And grown at length by Desperation bold Revolted, (so swift Fame soon after told, And has perhaps these Tidings publish'd here,) And fierce in Arms against their Prince appear. Him they depos'd, and to his Brother's Head Transferr'd the Crown; for Refuge Raman fled To Gallia's Court, of sov'reign Power bereft, Curst by the Tribes, and by his Creatures left. Alfred, when first he heard th' Oppressour's Fate. Reflecting wisely on th' unhappy State Of Kingdoms subject to a cruel Lord Who breaks thro' Laws and governs by the Sword, These Words exprest; What Care should Princes use Lest they, by Pride and Passion sway'd, abuse Their Pow'r, by Deeds despotick shake the Throne, And by their People's Ruin, cause their own? When Alfred this delightful Town had view'd, Our destin'd Journey ardent we pursu'd To rich Italia's Land, and swiftly past Germania's States that intervene; at last We reach'd the Hills which Snows eternal hide, Hesperia's Frontier on the Northern Side. With cheerful Labour we began to climb The steep Ascent and craggy Rocks sublime; These horrid Seats, this howling lonesome Place, This Desart wild, and desolate of Face, As we advanc'd, to our admiring Sight Open'd new Scenes of Terrour and Delight. Pleasing Amazement seiz'd our Minds to see Nature so rude, and such Variety Of Wonder and Affright, while every Way These Regions some surprising View display. The Mountains Peaks, with flaky Fleeces White, So high ascended that the solar Light Reflected could not climb so great a Height! And hence the Skies remain so cold, they know No Exhalations, no moist Stores, but Snow. Soft Zephyrs, tepid Show'rs, and gentle Dews, That on the Meads their genial Stock diffuse, To Seats inferiour their Production owe, Hover in Clouds and hang in Foggs below. The misty Convex of the Atmosphere Did at a Distance spread below appear, While we, in Air serene, beheld from far Conflicting Meteors and Aerial War, And looking down, saw Mists extended lye, And Rafts of floating Clouds beneath us fly. Here Pyramids of Snow immense, that climb Etherial Heights and pierce the Clouds sublime, Mix their white Heads with Heav'n's blue Hills, and rise Hoary with Winter's Force in Summer's Skies. There Gulphs, profound and gloomy as the Night, With solemn Horrour prejudice the Sight. There unctious Pines on barren Ridges stand, Disdainful of the Vale's prolifick Land, And, like the Firs along Norwegia's Shore, From frozen Hills derive their fiery Store. There broken Cliffs, that fell with dreadful Sound And shook the Woods and snowy Peaks around, With craggy Heaps deform the wounded Land, As active Demons at their Lord's Command, Or fabled Giants had in sportive Toil With rocky Ruins spread the lonesome Soil. Great Waters here from cavern'd Mountains gush, And spreading Torrents unsupported rush Down in Cascades immense, to find below More equal Grounds and Channels where to flow. These Falls out-roar the Monsters that possess The howling Empire of the Wilderness, While the continu'd Noise of dashing Waves Rebounds from echoing Hills and repercussive Caves. Surpriz'd and pleas'd we now beheld the Source Whence celebrated Rivers take their Course: As Egypt's Natives for their Nile depend On the relenting Treasures that descend Swift from the Moon's exalted Mountains, so The rapid Rhone, the Rhine, and Danube flow From unexhausted Heaps of Alpine Snow: For while that plenteous Stock in gentle Rills, Or ample Streams, falls from the channell'd Hills, Those Floods their Current from the Confluence gain, And thence supply'd their vast Expence sustain. Pleas'd with these various Works of Nature's Art Alfred disclos'd the Passions of his Heart, Praising in rapt'rous Speech the wise Design And wond'rous Scheme of Providence Divine. Thus he exalted Sentiments express'd, Then in these Words fam'd Hannibal address'd, Great Leader, what heroick Heat inspir'd Thy Veins, and thee with brave Ambition fir'd To mount these lofty Lines and Mounds of Snow, That reach the Clouds, to seek the distant Foe? Thy Tempest, gath'ring in th' aspiring Hills, With War unknown the Alpine Desart fills, Pours Carthaginian Thunder from the Skies, While rushing Floods of Wrath the Vale surprize. Brave enterprizing Chief, thus far renown'd! What Fame, what Triumphs, had thy Progress crown'd, Had not the soft Delights of Capua more Obstructive prov'd than the hard Rocks before. These Heights surmounted with Delight and Pain, We enter'd fair Hesperia's flow'ry Plain, And passing thro' rich Towns that crouding stand, And with their Tow'rs the Soil around command, We safe arriv'd at Rome's illustrious Tow'rs, The sacred Empress of the Christian Pow'rs; Where the great Pontiff, with distinguish'd Grace And Marks of Honour, did the Prince embrace. Still he express'd to Britain's King above His other Royal Sons Esteem and Love, Who, by his princely Gifts to Rome endear'd, A generous Monarch and a Saint appear'd. The Honours heap'd upon Atulpho's Son At first we judg'd were to the Father done; But when the Pontiff saw his Virtues shine, His Reason, Wit, and Sentiments divine, His Mien majestick, and polite Address, That Worth Heroick and high Birth confess, Uncommon Favours were on Alfred thrown, Not for Atulpho's Merit, but his own. Charm'd with his Morals, with his Arts refin'd, And all the bright Endowments of his Mind, He felt paternal Pleasure in his Breast, And fondly, as a Son, the Prince carest. By pompous Shows and Pastimes, splendid Feasts, And Banquets, worthy of imperial Guests, Melodious Musick, Interludes, and Plays, And all Things that Delight and Wonder raise, The Roman Lords, so Leo gave Command, Regal'd Prince Alfred with a gen'rous Hand. He often view'd the Town of wide Extent, The Tow'rs sublime, and Domes magnificent, The Palaces with Art consummate rear'd, Where Strength and perfect Symmetry appear'd; Proud Statues on the Walls around were plac'd, And each high Room of State rich Hangings grac'd, Hangings, that rivall'd Life in Figures bold, Silk form'd the Shades, the Lights were ductile Gold. But tho' Hesperia's Towns in Pow'r and Pride By Rome's illustrious Head are all outvy'd, Yet is she sunk from her great State, before When Pagan Lords the regal Scepter bore. In her proud Reliques Albion's Prince could trace The beauteous Features of a ruin'd Face. Imperial in Destruction she appear'd, And as a mighty Shade is still rever'd. Stupendous Fragments and august Remains Seen in the Town, or scatter'd thro' the Plains, Tell what this potent Empress was of old, Whose awful Nod the trembling World controul'd. So when a Delver has by Fortune found Vast humane Bones long buried under ground, He stands with Arms uplifted to the Skies, And views astonish'd their enormous Size; Then judges, by their Bulk and wond'rous Length, They fram'd some Giant of prodigious Strength. The sage Instructor, who Prince Alfred led To Monuments renown'd, thus pointing said; There mighty CÃ¦sar's lofty Palace stood, Where Gardens boasted once an Orange Wood, Fair Citron Groves, and arboring Myrtle's Shade, Rich Fruits and Flow'rs, that mingled Scents convey'd, And various Colours mixt with lovely Strife, Besides fam'd Statues Ã¦mulous of Life, And od'rous Shrubs of everlasting Green, And Rows of Pines with verdant Walks between. There see the ample Cave and Marble Shores Where slept in Peace collected liquid Stores, By long and costly AquÃ¦ducts convey'd, That thus an artificial Sea display'd; Where oft, to please the Sons of Rome, were seen Embattled Lines of Ships and Fights marine. Now the capacious Theaters they view'd, And now the stately Structures, that include Patrician Ashes and th'imperial Urn, Where Funeral Lamps without expiring burn. Here an illustrious Arch of Triumph stands For Laurell'd Chiefs, who came from conquer'd Lands Till the wide Globe, by Rome's resistless Sword Subdu'd, no more proud Sirnames could afford To her great Sons, while of its Titles drain'd, As well as Wealth, the vanquish'd World complain'd. There Obelisks and Pyramids arise, Whose mystick Figures entertain the Wise, And with Egyptian Learning grace the Skies: Here ancient Pillars of stupendous Height And stately Bulk Astonishment excite. There verdant Walks extended lay betwixt Fair Ranks of Golden Fruit-Trees intermixt With Pleasure-Houses, Baths, and glitt'ring Tow'rs, Unrivall'd Fountains, and sweet Jes'mine Bow'rs. Here Pagan Temples high in Ether rear'd Their Heads, by erring Vot'ries once rever'd, Who from unbreathing Images implor'd Blessings, and loose immoral Gods ador'd. Some from wide Roofs, contriv'd with wond'rous Art, Dazling to Sight Corinthian Glory dart; Some on proud Pillars rais'd of Size immense, And beautify'd with Skill and vast Expence, Enrich'd with various party-colour'd Stains, And Stones of Azure streak'd with Golden Veins, From polish'd Marble Walls and Turrets bright Send splendid Glances and rebounding Light: But how her Pow'r and Pride are now debas'd! How lyes her Honour in the Dust effac'd! Strangers, observe that venerable Soil, There once aspir'd sublime the awful Pile Where the august assembled Lords of Rome Acquitted Princes or pronounc'd their Doom, Made subject Monarchs, and imperious sway'd The conquer'd Nations that their Will obey'd: Here faithful States Rome with her Favour crown'd, And from their Thrones Kings disobedient frown'd; Now Shrubs and Moss in Seats Patrician grow, And Weeds their Birth to stately Ruins owe. In noble Rubbish there the Court behold Where fix'd Decrees of Justice were enroll'd; Where Orators for Eloquence renown'd, Excelling all in boastful Athens sound, With ardent Zeal maintain'd their Client's Cause, Defended Freedom, and explain'd the Laws. Here did the Glory of the Latian Blood, Great Tully, oft pour forth a plenteous Flood Of Words divine, and with resistless Art Touch'd every Spring, and master'd every Heart: His Charms could raise Emotions and controul, And from the Breast transport the ravish'd Soul, While he prevailing Force and Light display'd, And his own Ardour to their Veins convey'd. Great venerable Shade! degenerate Rome! Illustrious Patriot! ah, thy rigid Doom! How did thy Head, before the Rostrum hurl'd, Reproach th' ungrateful Victors of the World? Thy breathless Lips vile Anthony arraign, On that loose Roman's Name imprint a Stain Indelible, and wound his Honour more Than thy invective Stings had done before. There see Vespasian's Theater sublime Defac'd, not ruin'd, by the Pow'r of Time; Where Gladiators strove in bloody Fight To give the Roman horrible Delight. View that wide Space that broken Walls surround, Where Charioteers with envy'd Palms were crown'd, When their train'd Coursers, fleeter than the Wind, Victors their panting Rivals left behind: The Roman Youth here eager of a Name Flew to the Goal swift as th' alluring Fame For which they gasp'd; none made more bold Efforts To gain the Prize at old Olympick Sports, While their hot Steeds impatient of the Rein Their active Sinews work, their Eye-balls strain, And spread the Air with Dust, with Foam the Plain. And now the learned Sage, Prince Alfred led To the fam'd Field of Mars, and pointing said; Th' assembled People here advanc'd by Vote Lords to great Stations, who their Favour sought, Strangers observe, that once this fertile Field Did PrÃ¦tors, Censors, and great Consuls yield, Advanc'd Patrician Peers to high Commands, And sent deputed Kings to conquer'd Lands. Here, in the spreading unpolluted Bloom, And the maturer State of mighty Rome, Superiour Worth in every Choice prevail'd, And Posts of Trust on Merit seem'd entail'd; At length, the Taste and gen'rous Spirit lost That once the Sons of Romulus could boast, The Chiefs, who Honour and Promotion sought, With Bribes profuse corrupt Electors bought. These wanted Wisdom to reflect, that They Who purchase Places make the Nation pay. Unhappy Tribes, that could not till too late See that no Means are left to save a State Where ancient Virtues in Contempt are found, And Vice applauded is with Empire crown'd. By Feasts and Games and pompous costly Shows Now worthless Subjects to Preferment rose, Till the degen'rate Race, for Plays and Gold, To proud Ambition Roman Freedom sold. Thus Day by Day the Antiquary led The Prince to some fam'd Monument, and read On Marks of ruin'd Glory; which supply'd Great Images of Rome's imperial Pride. While thus he panted after Knowledge new, The Briton dearer to the Pontiff grew; Th' illustrious Heroe he so much admir'd, That, by an Impulse as from Heav'n inspir'd, He to anoint and crown him King decreed, That Alfred might, from Toil and Danger freed, To Albion's Throne in destin'd Time succeed. Progressive Time brought on th' auspicious Morn, When the great Pope determin'd to adorn Alfred with Marks of Honour, yet to none Of Rome's great Sons and favour'd Vot'ries shown. Now the bright Sun, before in Shades conceal'd, Dispell'd the Darkness and the Skies reveal'd. Guards, Heralds, Marshalls, and a num'rous Band Of Houshold Troops, and Chiefs of great Command, State-Officers and Judges, Magistrates And Presidents of Leo's subject States, And Peers distinguish'd by their Diadems, Array'd in Tissue deck'd with glitt'ring Gems, In due Succession regular and slow Mov'd to the Dome, and form'd a splendid Show And solemn Pomp, like that which Rome of old Us'd with repeated Rapture to behold, When her great Warriours of unrivall'd Fame, From conquer'd Kingdoms, Home in Triumph came. And now the Prince, Britannia's Hope and Pride, Advanc'd, while Troops were drawn on either Side; And clad in Robes Sky-colour'd, stiff and bright With Gold and Di'monds, glorious to the Sight, A Belt of broider'd Crimson round his Waste, With graceful Mien and Steps majestick past. A Canopy sublime, the inward Part Was Persia's Work, the outward Genua's Art, Dazling with Flow'rs of Gold, and high embost With silver Birds and Beasts at mighty Cost, By noble Youth above the Briton held His Head protected and the Sun repell'd. Superiour Lords in Birth and Lands before Britannia's Prince, proud of their Office, bore The Scepter, Globe, and Crown with Jewels bright, The aweful Ensigns of imperial Might. Such was the Heroe's Port, and in his Face Sweetness serene so soften'd princely Grace, Such was his artless Dignity of Mind And inbred Fire in proper Bounds confin'd, He seem'd some Envoy from the Seats above, That Awe excited and attracted Love. The Tribes in swelling Streams from every Street Rush to the Show, and in a Deluge meet: Unnumber'd Crouds, that thick in Clusters clung To the high Roofs and on the Windows hung, At once their Voices strain'd and eager Eyes To see and raise the Heroe to the Skies. Loud confluent Shouts the Heav'ns wide Concave fill, Ring thro' each Chrystal Plain, and Azure Hill, And bounding from the echoing Spheres convey Back to the Earth its Joy, and Rome repay. At Length the Pomp and long Procession came To the fam'd Dome that bore Saint Peter's Name; When Alfred ent'ring at the Temple Gate To the high Altar pass'd in princely State, Near which enthron'd the aweful Pontiff sate. Envoys from Monarchs, Princes, wealthy Lords, Leaders advanc'd to Honour by their Swords, And Rome's great Peers, who sacred Mitres wear And scarlet Robes, were pour'd around his Chair. The solemn Rites and Ceremonies pass'd, On kneeling Alfred's Head the Pontiff plac'd The glitt'ring Symbol of supreme Command, And gave the regal Scepter to his Hand, Then gracious look'd, and to th' illustrious Ring Pronounc'd Prince Alfred Albion's future King. All Leo prais'd, who thus the Briton crown'd For spotless Deeds and pious Life renown'd; For as thy Church, O Rome, as well as Court, Did Virtues more than modern now support, So Leo, of thy sacred Priests the Guide, By Lust of Gold unstain'd and free from Pride, Express'd a Heart to generous Deeds inclin'd, To Science, Arts, and Love of humane Kind. Labot, a Prelate of Britannick Race, That could his high Descent and Lineage trace From Heroe's lov'd at Home and fear'd Abroad Whose glorious Arms late Ages shall applaud, Had Wisdom, Learning, and Politeness join'd To State Endowments, and a noble Mind. Long since from Albion's Soil to Rome retir'd, He general Love and Glory here acquir'd, And now, so Leo bade, he mounts the Chair With a becoming Mien and solemn Air. The Rise of Pow'r was his important Theme, This he evinc'd sprung from the Will supreme Promulg'd by written Laws or Nature's Light, And that the branching Streams of ruling Might Were all deriv'd from that celestial Source, Which, as it gave, still feeds their binding Force. That Princes, who in Orbs illustrious shine Tenants of high Authority divine And scepter'd Stewards of entrusted Pow'r, Must all account at the last aweful Hour At Heav'ns august Tribunal, where uncrown'd They with the Vulgar stand on equal Ground. Hence he inferr'd, that Actions once enjoin'd By the immortal self-existent Mind, Of Pow'r, as well as Things th' exhaustless Cause, Can't be suspended by imperial Laws, Nor lose its first obliging Energy, By his own Viceroy's opposite Decree. He did with pious Vehemence display The sad Effects of arbitrary Sway, Where lawless Pow'r, and Pleasure unconfin'd, Defeat the Ends by Government design'd. Had Kings, said he, Perfection infinite, Unerring Wisdom to direct them right, And Goodness equal to unbridled Might, They should, like Heav'n, despotick Thrones possess, And Realms Submission boundless should express: But since destructive Passions frequent reign O'er Monarchs not controul'd, who oft disdain Reason's unequal Force, and in Debate Prefer the Flatt'rer to the Sage of State; 'Tis just that Subjects round the Throne should draw The sacred Lines of circumscriptive Law And solemn Compacts, that unbounded Pow'r May not encroach, and Property devour. And thus well-guarded Realms will never know The Plagues and sad Varieties of Woe, That from licentious Empire constant flow. As when the swelling Billows of the Main Insult the Shore and overflow the Plain, And while they forward rush with lawless Sway Involve the Herds, and sweep whole Towns away, The Swains, such future Mischief to prevent And disappoint th' invading Flood's Descent, Against the threat'ning Waves raise lofty Mounds, That now grow patient of their ancient Bounds. Wise Statutes so, and fundamental Right Protect the State, and check ambitious Might. Kings then are Great, when freely they dispence Their cheering Light and genial Influence On the glad Realms committed to their Trust, Frown on the Impious, and reward the Just; These Princes publick Benefactors grow, Like the first Cause, the Source to which they owe Of regal Pow'r their delegated Stream, On Heav'n dependant, tho' on Earth supreme. Thus various Kings, that Judah's Scepter sway'd, Their Subjects govern'd, and their God obey'd; And some great Monarchs of immortal Fame, That Rome's extended Empire rul'd, became, By all th' Expressions of a gen'rous Mind, The Blessing and Delight of humane Kind. When, said the Prelate, slighted Virtue weeps, And her divine Abode desponding keeps In some low Cave or unfrequented Waste Far from the Court, from which she flew disgrac'd, Good Kings invite her from her dark Recess, With bright Rewards and friendly Smiles, caress And place the lovely Stranger near the Throne, And make the World her Birth and Merit own. Then Liberty shines forth with heav'nly Grace, And shows the Godlike Beauties of her Face: Sweet-smiling Peace with soft prolifick Wings Broods on the Land, and unmolested sings: Divine Religion chearful rears her Head, And aweful makes the trembling Scoffer dread Her Frowns and threaten'd Vengeance, but imparts Transports of Joy to pure and pious Hearts. Flagitious Men, when Vice the Throne offends And Goodness Subjects to their Prince commends, Conceal their Crimes now ignominious grown, And for Respect claim Virtues not their own: Nor does the Hydra Vice in Triumph reign, Erect her Crests and spread her fatal Train; Her odious Brood lye not on Beds of Down Roll'd up to Rest, nor lurk about the Crown; Never their Heads in Tapistry enfold, Nor twist their pois'nous Spires round Busts of Gold: Thro' Rooms of State their Volumes never slide, Intrude in Councils, nor in Purple hide: None but the Wise, and Men of spotless Fame Can make to Posts of Pow'r successful Claim. These rule their Subjects with paternal Care, Crush proud Oppressours, and the Guiltless spare; Still studious in the Steerage they preside, And, tho' in Storms, unfluctuating guide The agitated State, and steady steer Mid'st Rocks and Shelves, and all that Pilots fear: They tender Bowels to their People show, And vigilant repell th' invading Foe; With just Compassion soften rig'rous Laws, And plead the Orphan's and the Widow's Cause, They sooth their Sorrows and relieve their Pains, Cloath their cold Limbs, and fill with Food their Veins; They guard the Merchant, and protect the Swain, And bid him reap in Peace his ripen'd Grain. These search with Care to find for Posts of Trust Men skilful, sober, cirumspect, and just; But, as suspected, prudently postpone Those who for Charges rudely press the Throne. Hail, happy Kings, in heav'nly Wisdom's School Thus form'd, and thus instructed how to rule: Happy the Nations, who such Princes gain, Blest with a Godlike just indulgent Reign. But those ambitious Monarchs who aspire To boundless Pow'r, impell'd by strong Desire Of Glory misconceiv'd and false Renown, Vex foreign Kingdoms, and oppress their own; In vain attempt to purchase worthy Fame, And win th' applauded Heroe's deathless Name; In vain unnumber'd Vet'ran Troops enroll, And martial Terrours spread from Pole to Pole, Affright the trembling World with fierce Alarms, And waste the Nations with inglorious Arms. What are these Chiefs whom haughty Wreaths adorn, But lawrell'd Robbers high in Triumph born, Elated by their Mischiefs, proud of Guilt, And pleas'd with Seas of Blood unjustly spilt? He ceas'dâWhen confluent Murmurs of Applause From the thick crouded Floor and Scaffolds rose To the resounding Roof: And now the Quire, Which all the tuneful Sons of Art admire, Begin an Anthem of Celestial Praise, And above Heav'n Jehovah's Greatness raise. Now from th' Dome th' illustrious Pair retreat, And march with solemn Pace to Leo's Seat; The joyful Throng the moving Pomp pursue, Repeat Applauses, and loud Shouts renew That o'er the Hills of Rome promiscuous rise, Reach distant Clouds, and echoe thro' the Skies. Rome's crosier'd Prince, and Britain's promis'd Heir Now gain the high imperial Palace, where Domesticks, so their Lord his Will exprest, Had at a vast Expence prepar'd a Feast Worthy of Leo and his Royal Guest. All Fish applauded by the skilful Cook, The Captives of the Net or of the Hook, That seek the stagnant Pond or streaming Brook, That oft their Scenes of Pleasure change, and crave By Turns the sweet, by Turns the brackish Wave: All Kinds of feather'd Luxury that hide In shelt'ring Brakes, or wild in Rocks abide, That chuse the barren Heath, or fenny Moor, Or sweep with balanc'd Wings the ouzy Shore; The Beccafigo, Ortolan, and Quail, Delicious Dishes which in Courts prevail; The Deer, and Boar, and all the grateful Foods That range the Mountains or frequent the Woods: With Pyramids compos'd of golden Fruits, Greens of rich Verdure, and high-tasted Roots; Immense Prosusion! spread th' extended Boards, Refresh'd the Prelates and regal'd the Lords. Wines rich as fabled Nectar, that appease Reluctant Cares and settled Sorrows ease, The noble Growth of sweet Campania's Soil, And the Reward of Tuscan Farmer's Toil; The Vintage gather'd by Calabrian Swains, That crowns Iberia's Hills or Gallia's Plains, In massy Gold and Silver went around, With generous Foam and Purple Honours crown'd: Glasses in tow'ring Rows, the curious Skill Of high Venetia's Sons, the Side-Boards fill; While Voices by consummate Art refin'd, With speaking Strings and sweet-mouth'd Tubes combin'd, (Melodious Pleasure ravishing to hear!) By soft Vibration sooth'd the attentive Ear, Gave Flavour to the Wine, and Rellish to the Chear. Hesperia's spicy Plants, and fragrant Flow'rs From Gardens Rivals of Arabian Bow'rs, Persia's sweet Groves, and India's rich Perfumes, Diffus'd voluptuous Vapours thro' the Rooms. Joy'd with the Splendour of the princely Feast, Magnificent Excess, each chearful Guest Applauded much the Art and much the Cost That all Hesperia's Luxury engrost. Now to the Field of Mars the Youth resort To spend in various Games and active Sport Declining Day, where Strangers might behold The manly Pastimes us'd in Rome of old. Soon as the Sun retreating from the Skies Left sick'ning Day defrauded of Supplies, And the dim Glim'rings of expiring Light Involv'd in Shade eluded Mortals Sight; Illuminations all the Dwellings grac'd, Diffus'd new Splendour and the Day replac'd, And Fires expressive of uncommon Joy, Nocturnal Triumph, Rome's glad Sons employ, While in the Court the chearful Night concludes With Musick, Dancing, Masks, and Interludes. The Time to Pleasure destin'd thus expir'd, Which the august Solemnity requir'd, Britannia's Prince, to his first Purpose true, Determin'd now his Labours to renew. To the high Vicar he all Marks exprest Of filial Rev'rence and a grateful Breast, For the great Honours granted, and declar'd That he to leave Hesperia now prepar'd. Leo reply'dâAlfred, to Leo dear, Receive my Blessing, and my Counsel hear. While you from Realm to Realm, from Isle to Isle, Studious of Wisdom with Heroick Toil Patient advance, and undismay'd expose Your Life to great Varieties of Woes, To Shelves and Tempests on the Ocean's Tide, By Land to Deaths and Hazards yet untry'd, Stedfast on Heav'ns propitious Aid rely, To this safe Rock in threat'ning Danger fly: That you divine Protection may assure, And thro' a thousand Terrours pass secure, From Virtue's sacred Precepts never stray: Heav'n only those will guard, that Heav'n obey. In your full Strength and Bloom of Youth beware Of Beauty's Force and Love's enchanting Snare; When Pleasure tempts you with expanded Arms, Due Distance keep, and gaze not on her Charms; Should you presumptuous face the lovely Foe, Too late convinc'd you will your Weakness know: Avoid th' alluring Syren's Voice and Sight, You stay in Danger, but are safe in Flight. If on the Verge of Vice you careless play, The dubious Limits will your Feet betray, In some ungarded Hour you'll miss your Ground, And, when you pass the Lines that Virtue bound, You'll know not where to stop, but cease to mourn Your Crimes, and prove reluctant to return. Besides forbidden Pleasures will unbind Your manly Sinews and dissolve your Mind: From Guilt their Fountain Fear and Terrour flow, Whence Men or timr'ous or remorseless grow: The Best and vilest Sort are only bold, And unconcern'd approaching Death behold, While unreflecting These contemn their Fate, And Those expect a future blissful State. The middle Kind in Part with Guilt distain'd, In Part by Fear of Heav'n from Vice restrain'd, Against the King of Terrours cannot stand, But pale and trembling view his lifted Hand: The Heroes, who in Arms immortal shine From Heav'ns bright Stores and Arsenals divine, Fair Innocence, pure Faith, and pious Love, Firm in Distress and brave in Danger prove. Mid'st boist'rous Waves, like stable Rocks, they dwell, And scornful of its Rage the Storm repell: In vain hoarse Thunder rolls in ambient Skies, Against their Heads in vain fierce Lightning flies. Patient in Suff'ring and in Woe resign'd, They no Regret, no Discomposure find, Never the Steps of Providence arraign, Nor of Injustice petulant complain. When you return to fair Britannia's Isle, Thus habited to Care and vers'd in Toil, Your noxious Passions vanquish'd, and your Mind Form'd for Dominion, and with Arms refin'd, You'll rule your Subjects with indulgent Laws, Guard publick Right, and own Religion's Cause. What a rich Train of Blessings will a King So fit for Empire to his People bring! Fame, pleas'd th' illustrious Province to sustain, Will spread the Glories of your Godlike Reign; On her bright Pinions will convey your Name, And your great Deeds from Realm to Realm proclaim. You, in your Subjects grateful Hearts, will lay Such strong Foundations of Imperial Sway, As will in Storms of State remain secure, And all the Insults of your Foes endure. You Sycophants will banish from the Throne; They will not seek your Greatness, but their own; These a wise Prince to his high Office just May sometimes manage, but will never trust. You'll spurn the Avaricious with Disdain, Who sell their Country, King, and Friends for Gain, That in immense Possessions curs'd are poor, And Beggars in Abundance covet more. In vain the Indies would exhaust their Store To cure their raging Lust of golden Oar, Whose Hoards, tho' swelling to a vast Extent, Sink not th' hydropick Fury, but augment. Thus you its Father, Patron, Guardian, Friend, And Benefactor, will your Realm defend: Those Titles, greater than the awful Stile Of Monarch, will advance Britannia's Isle. He ceas'dâAnd now in solemn Manner bless'd The Briton, and paternal Care express'd. His gracious Arms his royal Son embrace, While plenteous Tears fell down his reverend Face. These tender Passions pious Alfred move, Who in the Pontiff faw the Father's Love: His Words abrupt, and discompos'd his Air, He took his Leave, and did with Speed repair To Ostia's Port, where a tall Vessel lay Ready the British Heroe to convey To high Parthenope: And here the Night He pass'd, and waited for the dawning Light. The Morning Beams now thro' the Sky display A rosy Tincture, and infuse the Day: Alfred embark'd, and, favour'd by the Wind, Stood off, and left the flying Shores behind. The bounding Ship before th' impulsive Gale, That swell'd the Bosom of th' expanded Sail, Spoon'd swift away along Hesperia's Coast, And soon subsiding Ostia's Castles lost: Ostia, where first the Trojan with his Band Made his Descent on sweet Italia's Land; And not remote the first Foundations laid Of Rome's wide Empire, which the World obey'd. This City once (by Martius built in part, Part by succeding Princes) vy'd in Art Shown in its Haven, Palaces, and Tow'rs, With the chief Labours of the Roman Pow'rs. Its Beauty, proud Magnificence, and State, Its Amplitude, and Wealth, did once create In gazing Strangers Wonder and Delight, And Envy in Hesperia's Lords excite. Advancing, next we pass'd the pleasant Shore Where Latin Kings of old the Scepter bore, And here beheld the celebrated Wood, Near which Laurentum once aspiring stood: The spacious Lawrel-Groves, that gave the Town Its Appellation, with rich Verdure crown The Region, sooth hot Sun-beams, and prepare: For Health and soft Delight the scented Air. Near this the City, that from rising Ground Survey'd the Seas and hollow Shores around; Ancient Lavinia, whose recorded Name From the fair Consort of Ãneas came, Rear'd her proud Head now scarcely known to Fame. Next Antium's Tow'rs their Lustre once display'd, Then great by Land and flourishing in Trade, Founded by Circe's and Vlysses Son, Whence the old Volscian potent Reign begun, Whose hostile Corsairs seiz'd the Merchant's Gain, And with pyratick War distress'd the Main; Since Neighb'ring Pow'rs and adverse Turns of Fate Destroy'd the Strength and Splendor of the State. Now scatter'd thro' the Mountains, Woods and Plains The Trav'ller sees the City's rude Remains, And wand'ring Farmers on the Ruins tread, In which the Town conceals her fameless Head. Next the CircÃ¦an Hills sublime and steep, Above the watry Convex of the Deep Ascending slowly, gain their airy Height, And open by Degrees a charming Sight; While issuing from the Land they wedge their Way Amid'st the Waves, and form the spreading Bay Where Terracina's Turrets midst the Sky O'erlook the Billows that beneath her lye, And view the Streams, and Fields, and Towns around Crouded with People and with Plenty crown'd. Now Boreas in the Shrouds began to roar, And furious beat us from Hesperia's Shore; Collected Clouds the Fields of Air o'erspread, And in their Wombs the growing Tempest bred, Which soon discharg'd its Rage upon the Main, Whilst we unguided sail'd thro' Storms of Rain, Loud Peals of Thunder, and exploded Flame, Till all our Men and Vessel lost, we came Shipwrack'd to Shore on fair Numidia's Land, Bless'd by Subjection to your high Command. Here a sage Hermite, in a heav'nly Dream By Night admonish'd from the Pow'r supream, Met and receiv'd Us kind, till with Repose And cheap but wholsome Food refresh'd we rose, Then we, the Hermite's Dictates to obey, Pursu'd to this delightful Town our Way. He ceas'dâAnd all the Briton's Conduct prais'd: His Suff'rings much, and much his Virtue rais'd Wise Halla's wond'ring Thoughts, but chief his Mind Humble in good, and in ill Fate resign'd. Now did the Night her Noon o'erpast prepare To quit in Turn the Empire of the Air, When the pleas'd Audience to their Rest retir'd, Commended Guithun, and his Prince admir'd. BOOK V. The ARGUMENT. Alfred sails from Tunisia to Parthenope. The Description of King Artolan's Palace, who receives and entertains the Briton with great Respect. The Prince surveys the Curiosities of the Town, and the neigbouring Country. The Grott of Lucullus, Pausilippo, BaiÃ¦, Puzzolo, Vesuvius. Artolan carries the Prince to Ischia: While they are viewing that Island, Messengers arrived from Naples acquaint the King that his Subjects had taken up Arms against him, and were advanc'd as far as Capua in their Way to Naples. The King returns thither with Speed, gives Order that his Army should be assembled to suppress the Rebels. Barri, at Prince Alfred's Request, relates to him the Causes of the Sedition. The Prince accompanies Artolan to the Field, and when the Armies were ready to engage, he rides between them, proposes Terms of Accommodation to either Side, and at length procures Submission from the Rebels, and an Amnesty from the King. Publick Rejoicings made for the Peace. Artolan reforms the Court. Puts Persons of great Abilities into the chief Offices of State. The Characters of his new Ministers. The discarded Courtiers highly enraged at their Disgrace meet in Council, and agree to use all their Industry and Power to embroil Affairs, and distress the King. Arban, to gratify his Revenge, proposes the Assassination of Alfred on the Sicilian Coast. The Rest agree to it. A Bark and Men are hired for this Purpose. Raban their Chief, having been formerly discharged from Imprisonment at Rome by Prince Alfred's Means, reflects on his Ingratitude, and discovers the Plot. The Conspirators are seized, tryed, and condemned, but pardoned upon Alfred's Intercession. The Prince takes his Leave of the Court, and sails for Sicily. In Halla's Court Britannia's Heroe spent His Hours with great Delight, while he intent Observes the Manners, Customs, Rites, and Laws, That fam'd Tunisia's Wealth and Greatness cause, And crown the Sov'reign's Conduct with Applause. And now the Briton, who had stock'd his Mind With new and useful Schemes of various Kind, Decreed again to try his Fate by Sea, And seek the Coast of fair Parthenope. Then taking Leave, the Monarch he address'd, And Strains sincere of Gratitude express'd. The smiling Graces of the infant Morn Now dawning sweet the peaceful Skies adorn; No hov'ring Foggs, no Clouds their Gloom display, Obscure th' Horizon and suspend the Day. A southern Wind, that from Tunisia bore Soft balmy Vapours, and the fragrant Store Breath'd from Numidia's Woods and flowry Plain, Perfum'd the Air, and gently mov'd the Main. The Sailers now, so Halla bade, prepare Th' appointed Vessels with assiduous Care: Some rang'd, and bending forward, in Array Howl at the Cables and the Anchors weigh: Some sitting cross the Yards the Shrowds dispose, Expand the Canvass and the Gale enclose: Others bring Fowl, Sherbets and Fruits aboard, And in the Hold Numidia's Pleasures hoard. Britannia's Prince, advancing to the Strand, Mounted the Ship well-rigg'd and fully mann'd, Then stood his Course to gain Hesperia's Land. Thrice had the solar Orb around the Earth Describ'd his radiant Circle, giving Birth To the new Morn, as oft prevailing Night In Turn succeeded discontinu'd Light; When sailing near the Shore at Height of Day They came with Joy before fair Naples Bay, A Sea-Peninsula of great Extent, Which to the Midland Ocean's Continent A watry Isthmus joins, that with its Tide From Ischia's Banks does Caprea's Isle divide. They thro' this opening Mouth their Way pursu'd, And not remote the rising Castles view'd. Alfred with Pleasure did the Coast survey, Where in a beauteous Bow extended lay Sublime Parthenope of wide Command; The Heroe soon debark'd and came to Land. Here Artolan the regal Scepter sway'd, Whose Laws Campania's happy Soil obey'd, And the rich Fields which owe their flow'ry Pride To Liris's Bounty and Vulturno's Tide, With the fair Realm, that stretches to the East By wanton Sora's Chrystal Arms carest Between the sandy Margins, which restrain Th' Ionian Billow and the Adrian Main. The Briton much admir'd the stately Town, And much the Royal Palace, whose Renown The Tow'rs and Piles magnificent outvyes That with their Splendour grace Hesperia's Skies. The Structure rose august on Pillars plac'd Of Corinth's beauteous Order, and was fac'd With polish'd Marble proud of curious Stains, And Azure Stones enrich'd with golden Veins. Here Statues feigning Life, th' amazing Skill And Pride of Greece, the hollow Niches fill: There other Creatures of an equal Hand On the high Walls in pompous Ranges stand: The lofty Rooms of State at vast Expence Were beautify'd with Luxury immense, With matchless Purple by the Tyrian sold, Rich Tapistry, and pond'rous Busts of Gold, Gilded Pilasters, odorif'rous Doors Of Cedar, painted Ceilings, checker'd Floors, And costly Tables of prodigious Weight, Some curious Porph'ry, some all massy Plate. At first the Monarch to the Prince express'd The usual Honours to high Birth address'd; At length his bright Endowments he admir'd, The Gifts of Nature, or by Art acquir'd, His princely Mien by all Spectators prais'd, And graceful Limbs that Love and Wonder rais'd, While charming Form and Nobleness of Mind To make a Prince like heav'nly Seraphs, join'd. Then as a Friend the Heroe he embrac'd, And with peculiar Marks of Favour grac'd. To the most curious Objects, that invite Th' attentive Trav'ller, and surprize the Sight, He oft Britannia's Prince in Person led, And on the Works of Art and Nature read. Alfred survey'd this celebrated Town In fair Hesperia of the first Renown: On the North Side he saw by slow Degrees A Hill arise adorn'd with verdant Trees; Where Balls, gilt Tow'rs, and Temples mixt with Rows Of Limes and golden Orange-Groves compose Delightful Landskips, while he doubtful stood If he beheld a City or a Wood. Now to Lucullus Grott the Heroe past, By daring Genius and with Labour vast Pierc'd thro' the Mountain's Bowels to display For trav'lling Troops a short and easy Way, And thus excuse a toilsome steep Ascent; The Prince surpriz'd thus gave his Passion Vent: O Rome! What Glory, Pomp, and Pow'r immense Did'st thou acquire! What boundless Opulence! When thy great Chiefs opposing Monarchs broke, Brought all the Realms around beneath thy Yoke, And fill'd thy Bosom with the gather'd Spoils Of vanquish'd Lands and tributary Isles; Since one of thy Patrician Sons alone At vast Expence has such great Wonders shown, And but a Subject of thy Empire vy'd With Kings, that broken Monarchies divide. He view'd Campania's Fields, and Capua's Tow'rs Whose Joys dissolv'd the military Pow'rs Of mighty Carthage, that by Sea and Land Did long by rival Strength high Rome withstand, While of th' expecting World th' imperial Sway Balanc'd in equal Scales suspended lay. And next the Charms of Pausilippo's Hill The Heroe with Delight and Wonder fill; From its exalted Heights with ravish'd Eyes He curious Scenes o'er the wide Bay descries; Its Head and Side are still with Pleasure seen Adorn'd with Flow'rs and never-fading Green; Whither the Rich in painted Boats repair To breathe the breezy Evening's cooling Air. Here they beheld the Mantuan's artless Tomb, The Prince of Poets and the Pride of Rome. When Guithun first observ'd the small Regard Paid to the Ashes of so great a Bard, Shame of th' ungrateful Nation he express'd, And then with solemn Accents thus address'd The unexampled Roman; Bard divine, What narrow Limits thy Remains confine? While thro' th' applauding World unbounded Fame Proclaims thy Labours and immortal Name. Happy the Bards! who sing, while Pow'rs supreme Pleas'd with the Muses taste the tuneful Theme: Princes with true heroick Virtue crown'd To Schools of Science are propitious found; For still a great and elevated Mind By native Instinct is to Merit kind. Deserv'd Renown thy lofty Genius gain'd, Because it flourish'd, when Augustus reign'd: Only such CÃ¦sars will a Maro raise, Only a Maro can such CÃ¦sars praise. He next at BaiÃ¦ did with Wonder see The Monuments of ancient Luxury, Where the great Sons of Art expensive strove Of the fair Seat the Beauties to improve. Here Neighb'ring Youth dissolv'd in soft Delight Play'd all the Day, and revell'd all the Night; Hither did Rome's Patrician Lords resort, Where Pleasure then was thought to keep her Court, And left their Shows and Games and high Employs To be regal'd with BaiÃ¦'s sweeter Joys, To which Thessalian Tempe's charming Field, And, Daphne, thy delightful Scenes must yield. The steaming Baths by tepid Vapours made Thro' subterranean Galleries convey'd, And CÃ¦sar's Ponds once for their finny Store And Structure fam'd, and num'rous Wonders more Britannia's Heroe saw, the proud Remains Of Roman Greatness scatter'd thro' the Plains. They view'd Puzzuolo on the adverse Strand, Whose Forts in Part the spacious Bay command; Where in deep Beds extended underground Exhaustless Stores combustible are found, Naphtha and Sulphur-Veins, that kindled rage And furious War in trembling Prisons wage. With Vapours now they fill the Vaults below, Now thro' the Air hot Eructations throw Of Smoak and livid Flame; and thus they form Beneath, the Earthquake, and above, the Storm: And since, from Wombs abrupt the cleaving Soil On the flat Lands has with convulsive Toil Exploded Hills and new-born Mountains cast, And with projected Heaps whole Towns effac't. Not far remote they saw the spreading Plains By Nature rich and till'd by Cuma's Swains, Where the fam'd Sybil in her Cave profound Secrets involv'd in Words of mystick Sound Oft utter'd from her agitated Breast, And future Fates inspir'd by Heav'n exprest, That sees in Causes and effective Springs The sleeping Scenes of unexistent Things: She Tribes unborn could number, and explain Of dark Events a long successive Chain, And by Prediction greater Fame acquir'd Than all her Sisters with like Rapture fir'd. Curious his Mind he with new Pleasure fed Viewing sublime Vesuvio's stormy Head, That high in Air with gloomy Terrours crown'd Scatters its crude unfinish'd Bowels round, Smokes in the Skies, and Thunders underground; Covers the Fields with unconcocted Oar, And with vast Heaps of Cynders spreads the Shore; While lab'ring it explodes from bellowing Caves Blue Sulphur flaming in uplifted Waves. He view'd the Vines, which round the Hills produce Clusters, that swell with such a gen'rous Juice As seem'd a Spirit, which its Strength acquires From Chymick Nature's subterranean Fires. The Briton hence Calabria's Plain descry'd Adorn'd with Grain and Groves and flow'ry Pride, Where crouded Towns almost contiguous stand, And scarce for Tillage leave sufficient Land. And now a costly Barge of Pleasure bore The King and Albion's Prince to Ischia's Shore, That with the ample Gulph encompass'd lay, Which the rich Soil's expanded Arms embay: They landed with a splendid Train; and while They view'd the Face of this delightful Isle, Three Lords with Consternation in their Eyes Arriv'd from Napolis the King surprize With News unwelcome; That Apulia's Lord Had drawn against his Prince his faithless Sword; That marching onward at his Army's Head, And threatning high, he the bold Rebels led To the imperial Seat of Artolan, And that to Capua's Gates the hardy Van Was now advanc'dâTh' uneasy King with speed And Albion's Prince from Ischia's Isle proceed To high ParthenopeâAnd then, to save The Realm from fierce Sedition, Orders, gave To congregate his faithful Troops, and form An Army to dispell the low'ring Storm. Barri, a Lord for loyal Zeal approv'd By Artolan, and thro' the Realm belov'd, To publick Good and Merit still a Friend, Was by the King commanded to attend Britannia's Prince since first he came to Land, And now alone did in his Presence stand. Alfred reflecting on the troubled State, Bespoke the Courtier thusâKind Lord, relate The genuine Causes, which you judge inspire The People's Breasts with this seditious Fire. No Facts important, no fit Lights conceal, But all the Springs of this Disease reveal; That done, with Zeal I'll labour to prepare Some Remedy of Force, with timely Care. The courteous Lord, who fully understood Alfred's great Mind and Aims at publick Good, Resolv'd to make th' enquiring Heroe know The fatal Fountain of the Nation's Woe, In Hope his num'rous Qualities divine Would now to prop a sinking State combine: Then thus he answer'dâWith a patient Ear, Illustrious Briton, my Narration hear. To sacred Vows, and social Virtue true, Uncensur'd still I paid th' Allegiance due To Artolan my Prince, and studious strove To guard his Throne, and fix his People's Love; And now at your Command I must with Sighs Tell the true Springs whence Feuds intestine rise. Know, Alfred, that our Prince, of Thought refin'd And blest with high Endowments of the Mind, To splendid Modes of Worship is inclin'd: Hence he adorn'd our Domes at vast Expence With various Pomp and great Magnificence: Those of the sacred Rank he most caress'd Who Show admir'd, and active Zeal express'd To beautify and make Religion shine In a rich Dress and Equipage divine. Besides misled he often seem'd to aim At Pow'r above the Laws, that thus his Name Might more respected and august become In foreign Courts, and more rever'd at Home. Hence all who sooth'd his Passion, and approv'd The Monarch's Conduct most, were most belov'd. In Swarms the Flatt'rers settled round the Crown, And fill'd all Posts of Profit and Renown: Dora and Arban gain'd his chief Regard, And uncontroul'd the royal Favour shar'd, Whence haughty Thoughts th' unrivall'd Pair elate, While That Religion rul'd, and This the State. Dora a Prelate, who for Wit admir'd And courtly Mien to Greatness still aspir'd, By subtile Conduct and consummate Art In Adulation, won the Monarch's Heart. The Flatt'rer soon high Pontiff was proclaim'd, The Height at which his tow'ring Wishes aim'd. Now while o'er sacred Rituals he presides, And all our Priests and solemn Worship guides, He soon display'd his Arbitrary Mind Where superstitious Bigotry combin'd With Cruelty and Pride, and now began To form and fix a new religious Plan. He forc'd the Priests and People to adore Their God by Rules and Ways unknown before: His Laws new-fangled Rites and Modes enjoin, Gay sacred Toys and Pageantry divine; New priestly Habits gorgeous to behold, Invented Shrines and Statues smear'd with Gold, A meretricious ceremonial Load Of godly Pomp imported from Abroad. Now costly Decorations introduc'd, Liturgick Rules and Manners never us'd In Temples here till now, create Offence, And the whole Realm against the Priest incense; While most his Precepts resolute withstand, Condemn the new, and the old Rites demand. The haughty Priest, with vengeful Rage inflam'd To find the End oppos'd at which he aim'd, Engag'd the Conscience of his zealous Lord To force the disobedient by the Sword. Now Persecution still with Slaughter fed, Shaking the Vipers round her frightful Head And grasping in her Hand her bloody Spear, Advanc'd, and fill'd the trembling Realm with Fear. Houses were empty'd, Prisons crouded, Chains Unwieldy, and unsufferable Pains From Racks and Tortures, for Religion's Sake, Thro' the sad Nation great Destruction make; And is it Wonder such tyrannick Ways Should Discontents and Heats seditious raise? Besides this Grief, the suff'ring Land arraigns The Government, and in bold Speech complains That Arban, of immod'rate Pow'r possess'd, Abus'd his Sov'reign and his Towns oppress'd: That he rapacious, by a lawless Course, By various secret Frauds and open Force, Draining the People's Chests to fill his own, In Wealth was Rival to a Monarch grown. From these two Heads, illustrious Briton, spring The Passions that inflame the Realm, and bring Threats on the Pontiff, and embroil the King. Hence were malignant Ferments spread that tend To publick Feuds and in Rebellion end: And now the Storm breaks out, unhappy Fate! That shakes th' enfeebl'd Pillars of the State. Of sacred Customs Men tenacious are, And will no sudden Change of Worship bear: This shew'd the Weakness of our Priest supreme, Who strove to fix at once his novel Scheme. All Reas'ning Heads on peaceful Counsels bent Saw rip'ning in its Seeds the sad Event, While the high Pontiff with imperious Sway Forc'd on the Subjects his new Modes, and they Stood full determin'd never to obey. They judg'd that Conscience cannot be compell'd, Nor her divine Dominion be upheld By uninstructive Penalties and Fines, Dark Prisons, and unedifying Mines; In vain th' Erroneous banish'd from their Home In Search of Truth thro' foreign Regions roam, Or in the Gallies School are taught in Chains, And disciplin'd for Heav'n by unenlightning Pains. He ceas'dâThen Alfred thus his Thoughts exprest; This Kingdom's Woes with Pity fill my Breast: I judge the Breach of fundamental Laws, Vows, and religious Rites, may justly cause The Tribes their State-Directors to arraign, And of their heavy Grievances complain: Yet publick Right here is not so infring'd, Nor so the Frame of Government unhing'd, That Subjects wrong'd should martial Methods chuse, Enroll their Troops, and Force coercive use: All should Submission pay to Pow'r supream, And, till fierce Rage and Cruelty extream Shall warrant Self-Defence, should patient pray Succour Divine, and for Deliv'rance stay. Religion's sacred Altars I revere, And to celestial Truth shall still adhere Fix'd and determin'd, but I can't approve A Sword unsheath'd ill Prelates to remove: Nor will right Reason's Light their Cause support, Who would by Force reform an erring Court. But to prevent the most destructive Harms, And all the dire Effects of civil Arms, As Intercessour I'll assiduous try To make each Host with Terms of Peace comply. Soon as the King return'd to Naple's Strand, He issu'd to the Chiefs his high Command Their Cohorts to assemble on the Plains Of fair Campania, where soft Pleasure reigns. Now dawn'd the tender Morn, delightful View, Streaking with rosy Red th' etherial Blue: And then the Chiefs the Royal Standard rear'd, While bold in Arms the must'ring Host appear'd: Next Day the Monarch, with his martial Lords Who brandish'd high in Air their threat'ning Swords, And with an ardent loyal Zeal inspir'd Impatient of Delay the War requir'd, Advancing join'd his Troops; the King, to give His distant Legions Leisure to arrive, Staid in the Camp the next succeeding Day, Then drawing forth his Army in Array Mov'd forward to engage th' Apulian Host, And settle Quiet at the Rebell's Cost. The solar Orb had reach'd the Azure Height Of Heav'n, and shone with strong meridian Light, When the seditious Cohorts march'd in Sight. Now Front to Front th' embattled Armies stood, And Death prepar'd to sooth his Thirst of Blood. The Briton, conscious that the Rebels warr'd Chiefly their ancient sacred Rites to guard Against the Dictates of the Priest supream, Who now impos'd a new religious Scheme, Tho' they rapacious Arban too accus'd, Who, so the Tribes alledg'd, his Trust abus'd, Determin'd to attempt the Plan, design'd With Thoughts delib'rate and an anxious Mind, To make intestine Strife and Uproar cease, Disarm the Rebels and recover Peace. His Enterprize approv'd by Artolan, The Briton issu'd from the Army's Van; And to the Rebels with a princely Train Advancing pass'd the interposing Plain: But first a Herald to the Foe he sent To make his Person and his great Intent To Vlla known, who the bold Cohorts led. Vlla receiv'd him at his Army's Head, And strove all Honours and Respect to shew That his high Birth and Merit claim'd as due. Then Albion's Prince the Leader thus address'd; That this seditious Strife may be suppress'd, And heav'nly Peace again may bless the Land, Say, what your Troops and you their Chief demand. If you oppress'd such just Concessions want Which your great Monarch may with Honour grant, From civil Arms to give the Nation Rest, Your Grievances with Speed shall be redrest, If I, who act the Mediatour's Part, Am able to incline your Sov'reign's Heart. Vlla reply'dâIllustrious Alfred, know That our chief Suff'rings and Resentments grow From thisâThat haughty Dora misemploys His Pow'r, while ancient Worship he destroys: He those pursues with Punishments severe Who to their old Religion firm adhere, And to the Pontiff's Laws Respect deny, Nor with invented Rituals will comply: Hence Persecution rages in our Streets, And he, that flies from Guilt, Destruction meets. And each brave Man is justify'd, who draws The Sword to vindicate Religion's Cause Favour'd by Heav'n and fix'd by civil Laws. Who can their sacred Rites, their Deity And venerable Priests affronted see By novel Worship, and supine and cold Th' impending Tempest o'er their Church behold? Against these Foes our Ensigns are display'd, These daring Giants, that the Skies invade; Our pious Ardour must to Heav'n commend This right'ous War, while we for Heav'n contend, And arm'd against an innovating Sect, Our Altars dearer than our Lives protect. Know likewise Arban is obnoxious grown, And by his Conduct has disgrac'd the Throne, Whilst he by Rapine and a thousand Frauds Has fleec'd the People, pillag'd their Abodes, And gainful Posts at open Market sold, And thus exhausted all our Springs of Gold, Whose ne'er returning Streams their Passage make To Arban's dead uncirculating Lake: Whence just Reproaches and immmortal Shame Will stigmatize th' Oppressour's hateful Name. We ask this Pair, whose Crimes for Vengeance call, May by the righteous Sword of Justice fall; And that such Lords of Probity and Skill As we shall name, may publick Places fill: This done, we'll lay our Swords with Pleasure down, Obey our Sov'reign, and defend his Crown; Soon as his Heralds Amnesty declare To those who Arms to guard their Altars bear. He ceas'dâThe Briton then his Thoughts exprest; Important are the Ills which you suggest, And ought, but not by Force, to be redrest. If Princes never with tyrannick Aim Subvert their Empire's fundamental Frame, Nor breaking thro' the sacred Rules of Right Ravage with barb'rous Rage and lawless Might Their Realms, the Subject has no Plea to take The Field in Arms for meer Religion's Sake. Kings should in Peace their Dignity enjoy Who ne'er the Ends of civil Power destroy. But since some potent Fav'rites you arraign, And for your threaten'd Altars shew your Pain, An Intercessour I'll with Ardour press Your gracious Prince your Suff'rings to redress; Your Worship from new Rituals to secure, Clean as at first and from Addition pure. Since Means coercive are in vain enjoin'd To force the Judgement and convince the Mind. I'll strive to win your Prince no more with Arms And Vengeance to enforce Religion's Charms; Bloody Instructors never to enroll, That teach with Fire and Sword, and storm the Soul. Mean Time you'll no Hostilities commence, Till I return and bring your Monarch's Sense. He saidâAnd soon the loyal Host regain'd, And Vlla's Terms for settling Peace explain'd, Which with a frowning Air the King disdain'd. But Britain's Prince with Eloquence divine And Weight of Reason labour'd to incline The Monarch Vlla's Offers to embrace, And his obnoxious Courtiers to displace. He urg'd; to free from Ministers the Throne Who by illegal Deeds are hateful grown Is a wise Act, nor will Dishonour bring, But loud Applauses on th' indulgent King; Save Seas of Blood, and stop the fierce Alarms And Devastations of intestine Arms: Better one favour'd Chief should sink, than all The ruin'd Frame of Government should fall: Tho' the griev'd Subject should not Sword in Hand Favours, for which he ought to pray, demand; Yet Kings to some Complaints should rather yield, Then run the Hazard of a doubtful Field, And feed within the Bowels of a State, Consuming War and cherish deadly Hate, By which, whoe'er victorious prove at last, The Crown is weaken'd, and the Land laid waste. He urg'd; their Squadrons, tho' misled, reveal For Truth and Heav'n's Commands an ardent Zeal, And that Religion's Charms the Breast inflame With nobler Fire than Views of Pow'r and Fame, While all the Warriours strong in Faith regard Immortal Bliss their Valour's sure Reward; Hence in the Field they the bright Fauchion wave Fearless of Death, and grow in Battle brave. The Briton thus continuedâTo displace Pontiff's who dangerous Principles embrace, And by coercive cruel Ways enjoin New Modes of Worship, and new Rites divine, Will Feuds remove and stable Peace ensure, Nor can your Altars else remain secure: What Kingdoms e'er with ready Choice submit To new Religion, and their Ancient quit? In such Conjunctures they their Prince withstand, And ev'n to Blood resist his high Command: These must by Time be gain'd, nor will at once Embrace new Worship and the old renounce. And when a potent Minister of State Becomes the Mark of universal Hate, Envy, and Rage, 'tis Prudence to remove That Officer to fix the People's Love, Advance the Sov'reign's Credit, and prevent The threat'ning Storm from publick Discontent. Alfred did these convincing Reasons press With so much Spirit, such a just Address, And uncontested Signs of Zeal sincere, The King began to lend a gracious Ear, And soften'd by repeated Pray'rs comply'd With Vlla's Terms in Part, and Part deny'd. Alfred, his glorious Enterprize in view, With eager Speed back to the Rebels flew, Th' Apulian and his Captains to persuade That the Concessions by their Sov'reign made Were Grounds sufficient to dismiss their Arms, Quit Fields of Battle, and regain their Farms. Oft did the Heroe, to obstruct the Tide Of growing War, with Speed alternate ride Between the Armies that embattled stand, And only watch the Word of high Command Their mutual Fury to discharge, and stain With its own native Blood Campania's Plain: With soft Address the Way to Peace he smooth'd, And now the Rebels, now the Monarch sooth'd, Whence Condescensions grew on either Side, While each by Turns adher'd, by Turns comply'd. At length his Care and wise Advice succeed, And either Host to proffer'd Terms agreed. The Rebel-Chiefs, the King so gave Command, Their Pardon publish'd, kiss'd his gracious Hand. And Artolan in solemn Manner swore Their Freedom and Religion to restore; To rule the Land by Law and not by Might, Defend his Subjects and protect their Right. Thus Peace returning on the Nation smil'd, Disarm'd the Youth and eager Death beguil'd. Now from each Host loud Acclamations rise, And ecchoing Shouts of Triumph fill the Skies, Which beaten from Vesuvio's smoaky Caves Ring thro' the Shores, and shake the list'ning Waves. As when returning Beams new Light display, And dart along the Hemisphere the Day, Nocturnal Clouds that o'er th' Horizon spread Swelling with Vengeance in their Bowels fed, Won by the mild insinuating Heat Of interceding Rays, by Steps retreat, Neglect to form the Tempest, and prepare To leave at Rest the Empire of the Air. So Alfred's Wisdom from Campania's Plain Dispell'd the Storm, and eas'd the People's Pain. Now did the Monarch, fierce Sedition's Fire Subdu'd, to fair Parthenope retire, Where he dismiss'd the Ministers of State Who had incurr'd the People's general Hate. Dora the Pontiff, who abus'd his Trust, From his high Station was excluded first; And all the novel Modes and Rites divine Obtruded on the Nation with Design To change Religion, by the ruling Priest Who Pow'r ill us'd, the Sov'reign soon dismist. While all condemn'd the Pontiff's barb'rous Course, That would new Rites impose and Conscience force, Justly; can Arms o'er Reason Conquests win, And triumph o'er the awful Judge within? Do bloody Troops in Casuistry excell? Can Lictors able in Dispute dispell The Clouds of Errour that involve the Mind, And by enlight'ning Pains restore the Blind? Can Scourges argue, or the Rack persuade? Can Kings the Empire of the Soul invade? No, Let them first draw Armies in Array Along the Shore, and bid the Ocean stay His rushing Tides, the driving Storm restrain, And stop the rolling Sands on Libya's Plain; That done, the Tyrant may to Conscience say Rebel submit, and my Decrees obey. Next Arban was discarded odious, grown By Tyranny and Lust of Gold unknown; By Fraud and Force he strove his Soul to cloy With Wealth, which yet he knew not to enjoy. The King, obnoxious Courtiers thus disgrac'd, Bourgen and Poli in their Posts replac'd, Two Ministers of celebrated Name, That from the North of fair Calabria came. Bourgen, whose Virtues did illustrious shine, Such as adorn'd his fam'd Heroick Line, The Soul's minute Recesses had in View, And all the secret Springs of Empire knew. Studious his Monarch's Glory he sustain'd, Chear'd loyal Zeal, and Headstrong Faction rein'd; He to the Depths of Treason could descend, And thro' her dark and winding Walks attend The wily Serpent's Way, her Aims defeat, And make her hopeless to her Cave retreat. He shew'd a Zeal to serve Religion's Cause, Defend the Crown, and vindicate the Laws, Ne'er did his Actions from his Words dissent, Who never promis'd what he never meant, And unelated, when at Court employ'd, Only the Pride of doing well enjoy'd: Wrongs he forgot, but ne'er forgot his Friends, Nor publick Good postpon'd to private Ends, While worthy Patriots for great Posts he sought, And back to Favour banish'd Virtue brought. Poli was own'd a Genius rich and vast, By no profound experienc'd Sage surpast: The Monarch's Treasure, his important Trust, He still dispens'd to his high Office just: He, Poet-like, a Politician born Could only Nature's Work by Art adorn; Time did the finish'd Statesman but display, That whole in Embrio, tho' infolded, lay: Yet had he great appear'd by Art alone, Had sparing Nature less Indulgence shown. He by his Reason and superiour Sense Convey'd in all the Charms of Eloquence, Where Roman Force conspir'd with Attick Art, Convinc'd the Mind, and triumph'd o'er the Heart. On the full Audience he impulsive lay, Like a strong Wind whose Pow'r the Seas obey, Then did he work and agitate the Soul, Make the mov'd Passions This and That Way roll, And Ferments raise by Turns, by Turns compose; Hence he, withstood in vain by envious Foes, An Oracle in Council did preside, And matchless in Debate the Senate guide. Crater a Lord for Books and Business turn'd, Who the Decay of Arts and Learning mourn'd, Conscious that Erudition would refine Illustrious Blood, and make it brighter shine, That Sciences, which polish native Wit, Industrious Youth for Trusts important fit; Enrich'd his Mind in celebrated Schools With Letters, Arts, and wise instructive Rules; Then he in foreign Courts his Monarch's Cause And Country's Int'rest manag'd with Applause: Pleas'd with the promis'd Statesman all admir'd His Genius much, and much his Skill acquir'd. Now to State Cares and busy Life inur'd, By a swift Growth the Minister matur'd Came back, and, soon in a high Post employ'd, Well serv'd his Sov'reign and his Smiles enjoy'd. The King the Leader of his Army nam'd Ogan, a Chief for Deeds immortal fam'd: He brave in Arms, and great in martial Skill With his just Praises did Europa fill; He knew to scatter gath'ring Clouds from far, To fight a Battle, or direct a War. His wise Encampments, Marches, Choice of Ground And just Precautions with Success were crown'd; And thus by Foresight, Judgement, Vigilance He seem'd resolv'd to leave no Room for Chance, And would no Hazard in the Battle run, Assuring Vict'ry ere the Fight begun: Yet when engag'd he did such Courage show, And such Heroick Fire, as he would owe To Arms alone his Triumph's o'er the Foe. Patient of Toil and rig'rous Cold he knew To gain ev'n Winter Laurels, to pursue The Foe o'er frozen Mountains, and distain The Snows with Blood and thaw the icy Plain. The Monarch's Friends joy'd at their happy Fate, That Heads so able to direct a State, Endow'd with Courage, Zeal for publick Right, Deep Judgement, watchful Care, and piercing Sight, Were to high Stations rais'd; they now believ'd The Nation's Honour lost might be retriev'd; And should the factious Chiefs at Court disgrac'd, Indignant rave, and strive to be replac'd, Should violate their Oaths and sacred Vows, And while a Cause abjur'd they bold espouse, And the supream Avenger's Wrath despise, Rival th' accurs'd Original of Lies; Should they clandestine Councils hold, and form Seditious Plots to raise a civil Storm, Enroll their Troops, and foreign Pow'rs engage To lend them Forces and assist their Rage; Good Subjects hop'd these Statesmen would discern Their secret Schemes and Walks of Darkness learn; On their own Head would plotted Mischief turn, And make them Treason disappointed mourn; That while at Helm such skillful Masters stand, And steer with Conduct and a steady Hand, They'd free at length th' endanger'd Ship of State From Rocks and Shelves, on which, unhappy Fate! By temerarious Pilots she was thrown, Void of Reflection, or perfidious grown, And then thro' Uproar, Storms, and raging Seas Successful Guide her to the Port in Peace; While joyful Subjects shall obey their King, And the Snake Faction hiss without a Sting. Alfred with Joy unfeign'd the Monarch prais'd, Who thus to high Employs the Worthy rais'd; And saidâYou soon the glorious Fruits will find Of your new Scheme with so much Skill design'd: My wise Preceptor taught me, while he strove My Mind with prudent Maxims to improve, That Kings the Care of Empire should commit To Men renown'd for Wisdom, more than Wit; There might be found ev'n in degen'rate Times Ill fam'd for Vice and execrable Crimes, When publick Spirit's lost, and Honour scorn'd, Subjects with State Abilities adorn'd, Would Rulers search them out, and not regard Suitors unsham'd, nor Sycophants reward, Who shew no Title to their Monarch's Grant, But their false Virtue, and their real Want. The Wise with gen'rous Qualities endow'd Seek secret Life, and shun the noisy Croud; Nor is superiour Merit ever known For a great Place to importune the Throne. Still bashful Virtue would from Courts retreat, And only to be Useful would be Great, Nor till by warm Entreaties long withstood, Stoops to Promotion for the general Good. He saidâAnd now the City, highly joy'd With their restor'd Tranquillity, employ'd The Days a while in Sports and Games, the Nights In Feasts and various Pastimes and Delights. Dora's and Arban's Friends at Court disgrac'd, And envy'd Rivals in their Stations plac'd, Impatient rav'd, and curs'd their luckless Fate, Venting in desp'rate Speech enormous Hate. So the seraphick Rebel-Host, that fell From Seats of Bliss to the black Mouth of Hell, Pursu'd by Vengeance and to Flames condemn'd Rag'd in Destruction, and their God blasphem'd. Spurr'd by Revenge to desp'rate Means they fly And with their Schemes to make their Prince comply On their great Credit, Pow'r, and Wealth rely. The Leaders firm to their old Maxim stand, Never to serve a King they can't command; Nor to superiour Pow'rs Subjection pay, Who their imperious Dictates disobey. Intent to wreck their Malice on the Court, The restless Chiefs invited now resort To Arban's Palace, where in Council met They their ill Fate with Menaces regret, And, stung by Fury and infernal Hate, Decreed ill Blood and Faction to create, Perplex their Sov'reign and unhinge the State; While they resolv'd their Posts to re-enjoy, Or if they could not govern, to destroy. Thus Strife intestine must the Land devour To please a fond Caprice or Lust of Pow'r, While the false Patriot grows his Countries Foe, And sows the baneful Seeds of publick Woe To sooth Revenge, and with his cruel Sword Thro' the sad Kingdom's Bowels wound its Lord. Now did th' assembled Friends in Turn suggest Their various Schemes, that each esteem'd as best, By which the ruling Pow'rs might be distrest, Schemes with infernal Art contriv'd to bring Scorn on the Court, and Hatred on the King. Than Arban thus th' attentive Lords bespoke, Since Albion's Prince has by his Counsels broke A Frame of Government so wisely laid, And a new Scheme to us destructive made, Tis fit that first due Justice he should feel, And in his Veins receive the fatal Steel. Let us, ere yet the Briton shall pursue His Way, and bid to Artolan adieu, Dispatch a Ship arm'd with a valiant Band Of chosen Men, that on Sicilia's Strand May lye in ambush till he gains the Land; Whence rushing on him with a sudden Blow They may avenge us on this hateful Foe: Thus with his Blood, by just Resentment spilt, Let us asswage our Wrath, and purge his Guilt. That done, the Men their Vessel may regain, And to Hesperia's Shore soon cross the Main: Then we'll employ our utmost Care and Toil To sink the Monarch, and the State embroil. He ceas'dâThe Project pleas'd, and such were hir'd As this infernal Enterprize requir'd, Who guiltless Blood with Arms clandestine spill For impious Gain, and by Profession kill. The Russians, won by these conspiring Lords, To cut the Briton off with treach'rous Swords Made haste, and, eager of the great Reward, Convenient Stores a Bark and Arms prepar'd. Rabal was nam'd their Chief, one newly come To dwell in fair Parthenope from Rome, Where at the British Heroe's earnest Pray'r, When by the Pontiff crown'd, that all might share The joyful Triumph, he and others charg'd With various Crimes by Leo were enlarg'd. While Rabal restless on his Bed revolv'd Th' atrocious Deed, that rashly he resolv'd To perpetrate, his conscious Soul relents, And of the black Engagement he repents: Then anxious to himself he thus begun; What has ungrateful savage Rabal done? Shall I consent that by a treach'rous Blow A Prince shall die to whom my Life I owe? Shall he, the Flow'r and Joy of humane Kind, The Man, he gracious sav'd, his Murd'rer find? If I advance to strike him to the Heart, Aw'd by his Presence I should backward start: My shudd'ring Soul would feel distracting Pains, And struck with Horrour leave my freezing Veins: My Sword uplifted from my trembling Hand Would fall, while I should pale and lifeless stand: But gen'rous Alfred's Mercy, so he'll find, Has left Impressions grateful on my Mind. Now at the Birth of Day out sprang the Light, Beauteous Eruption, from the Womb of Night; When Rabal rose, made haste to Court, and told The black Design, and did at large unfold The bloody Scheme, and who the Authors were, Whose Heads contriv'd the execrable Snare. Then Arban, Borez, Fraca, Chiefs that fir'd With fierce Revenge against the Prince conspir'd, Seiz'd by the Sov'reign's Order were convey'd To the State-Prison and in Fetters laid. Now Artolan pronounc'd his high Command, That these three Lords that hir'd the cruel Band Should at his awful Judgment-Seat appear, And there arraign'd a righteous Sentence hear. The Lords before his just Tribunal stood, Charg'd with a cruel Plot to shed the Blood Of Albion's pious Prince, who guilty prov'd And doom'd to die were by the Guards remov'd. And now the Consorts of the Pris'ners drown'd In Floods of Tears, their Children weeping round, And many noble Lords by Birth ally'd, Suing for Mercy to the Prince apply'd. They the indulgent Briton's Breast assail With vehement Address, and to prevail All the pathetick Sentiments express That Fear or Love can dictate in Distress: They press'd him to forgive, and Pardon ask For the three sentenc'd Lords, an easy Task For such an Intercessour, who alone They judg'd the King's Displeasure could atone. Soon as they paus'dâ.Britannia's distant Heir The Supplicants dismiss'd, their earnest Pray'r Not granted nor deny'dâYet Alfred thought He should not seek the Mercy they besought For Criminals so black, but let the Laws Exert their Force, and vindicate his Cause. Then faithful Guithun thus the Prince bespoke; Let not this Crime so much your Wrath provoke As from your Breast Compassion to exclude, Just Anger sometimes is too far pursu'd. It is a Deed illustrious great and brave The Guilt to pardon, and th' Offender save. To bright heroick Virtue it belongs To bear Affronts, and patient suffer Wrongs; The Virtuous know, tho' wrathful Men believe Revenge is sweet, 'tis sweeter to forgive. Th' Almighty Being is to punish slow, While Mercies free from his soft Bowels flow: His Stores of Wrath Digestion long endure, And long lye hoarded crude and immature, Ere they a perfect State by Growth attain, And a due Ripeness for Destruction gain. So great and godlike Natures Pity show, Prone to forgive, and scarce Resentment know: Heroe's, who Conquerours of themselves suppress Pride and Revenge, more glorious Aims express Than mighty Warriours, who with Laurels grac'd Subdue wide Realms, and lay fair Cities waste. Then let not Alfred seek ev'n Vengeance due, But for th' Offenders to their Monarch sue; This to Religion's Honour will redound, Advance your Glory, and your Foes confound. He saidâThe Prince receiv'd th' impressive Force Of Guithun's prudent and divine Discourse: Then he absolv'd his Foes, and ardent strove With Artolan his Anger to remove, From the three Lords to turn th' impending Doom, And sink their Crime in dark Oblivion's Womb. He urg'd, that since their treach'rous Schemes relate To Alfred's private Person, not the State, Th' offended King with Honour might forgive The Lords condemn'd, and gracious bid them live. The Monarch, by the Heroe's Suit prepar'd, Forgave the Treason, and the Authors spar'd: Tho' Fame soon after told, this generous Deed Did not extinguish, but their Anger feed. The pious Briton by the Lords caress'd, Prais'd by the King, and by the People bless'd, Took Leave in princely Manner of the Court, And mid'st loud Shouts arriving at the Port Embark'd, and stood for fair Sicilia's Shore, New Scenes of curious Nature to explore, The Hills and Towns and Soil that Wonder cause, The People's Manners, and the Monarch's Laws. BOOK VI. The ARGUMENT. Alfred leaves Naples and directs his Course to Sicily. The Coast of Italy, by which he steer'd, described, as well as the Gulphs between Sicily and Calabria. He lands at Messina, is kindly received by Barlan King of the Island, where the People, unlike their Prince, were dissolved in Pleasure, and expressed the greatest Corruption of Manners. Their Idleness and Vices. Their Temple of Pleasure standing in the Middle of the Land described. Alfred's Curiosity led him to visit several remarkable Places in the Island. He goes to Catanea, and from thence to Centoripe, intending to visit Mount Ãtna the next Morning. At this Town an Angel inform'd him, that Lucifer with Design to destroy him, had order'd the Demons to cause a great Earthquake and a mighty Eruption from Ãtna. He warned Alfred to fly with Speed to the Eerian Hills, that by this Means he might escape the Judgement, which Heaven would permit to punish the Inhabitants of the Island for their Crimes, and where he might securely see this terrible Tragedy. Alfred obeys. The Angel assists him and Guithun in their Flight. The Eruption described. At Alfred's Prayer it ceases, and the Demons are driven away. Guithun from hence takes Occasion to discourse on the future general Conflagration, and shews what Preparations appear for it in the Structure of the Earth. And now unmoor'd the Heroe's Ship advanc'd From Napolis, and o'er the Ocean danc'd, While a propitious Wind the Sails inspir'd, And by Degrees the less'ning Tow'rs retir'd. Sweet-scented Exhalations, balmy Dews, And od'rous Steams, which Zephyrs far diffuse, The grateful Breath of each Hesperian Field And which green Groves and thymy Mountains yield, Regal'd the Britons Smell, while o'er the Tide, The Shoar in Prospect, they progressive ride. So when in India's Aromatick Isles Batavian Merchants burn redundant Piles, The Fruits of spicy Gardens, to the Skies In wheeling Clouds delicious Vapours rise, Which thro' the Air their spreading Incense cast, Superfluous Sweets and rich voluptuous Waste, Whence barren Hills and Seas and Lands unsown Are sooth'd with fragrant Pleasures not their own. Now did the Prince thro' foaming Billows sail, And weather'd soon, push'd by a breezy Gale, The Promontory whose high Head divides The rolling Waves that wash its rocky Sides: This Point, and that of Palinuro, keep The spreading Gulph half-sever'd from the Deep. Hence with a prosp'rous Course they spoon'd away Before the Wind, and gain'd the ample Bay Where fam'd Salerno stands sublime, a Town For letter'd Sages of the first Renown: Some from the lofty Chair in crouded Schools Expounded Nature, some taught moral Rules; With these the Sons of Ãsculapian Art, And tuneful Bards who touch the melting Heart With rapt'rous Songs, enjoy'd the sweet Abode, Whence Streams of Science thro' Hesperia flow'd. Advancing now along Calabria's Coast, The TerinÃ¦an raging Gulph they crost, Between th' Ãolian Islands and the Land Where Bruttian Pow'rs had once supream Command. Standing their Course they soon beheld from far Th' embattled Waves, that wage perpetual War, And with alternate Fury rouse the Main, Which Coasts almost contiguous so restrain That turbulent it rolls in peaceful Skies, And feels without a Wind the Tempest rise. From Shore to Shore high restless Billows roam, With Uproar fill the Deep, and spread with Foam The ambient Air, and thus, surprizing Sight! To the black Meteors send up Clouds of white. So narrow is the interposing Tide Whose boist'rous Waves Sicilia's Isle divide From fair Calabria on the adverse Side, That ancient Sages oft declar'd, that these Were once continu'd Lands, but by the Seas Insulted, and with Storms and Earthquakes worn They were by slow Degrees asunder torn. Revolving Eddies of impetuous Wind Caught in the Gulphs and by the Cliffs confin'd, Whirlpools and intercepted Floods enrag'd, Tides pushing Tides and Storms with Storms engag'd, From Rock to Rock, from Cave to Cave rebound, Embroil the Coast, and thro' the Hills resound. These congregated Terrors constant roar As deep-mouth'd Hell-hounds dwelt along the Shore, While dreadful Echoes fill the Land and Main, Amaze the Merchant, and affright the Swain. Here Scylla, whence prodigious Fables sprung Divulg'd by Sailers and by Poets sung, With her sublime accuminated Peaks Pierces the Clouds and their black Fleeces breaks; Begirt in Part with Groupes of smaller Rocks, Which by the Winds assaulted, and the Shocks Of raging Seas their craggy Heads reveal, Or in the Flood their treach'rous Heaps conceal. Such is the crooked Current of the Tide, That the aspiring Cliffs on either Side, And Promontories, to th' admiring Sight Appear to open now, and now unite; By Turns the stormy Waters to embay, And give by Turns to rushing Billows Way; Whence with loud Uproar Waves on Waves recoil, Roar in the Mountains, and the Sea embroil: Hence ancient Bards in legendary Verse Imagin'd Tales of this wild Deep rehearse; Hence rose the Monsters of Sicilia's Main, The dreadful Offspring of the Poet's Brain Not Scylla's Womb, with all the barking Brood And howling Horrours which the Rocks include. Like Danger's threaten'd from the adverse Strand, Ill fam'd for Whirlpools, Gulphs, and faithless Sand: The boist'rous Sea with Fury turning round From central Caves and Channels underground Rolls back upon it self, indignant raves And labours with regurgitating Waves, And, while the Eastern Wind the Ocean moves, Oft to th' advent'rous Merchant fatal proves. Here too, the Tyrrhene Sea thro' Roads unseen Secret Canals and Burrows sub-marine, Rushes along the excavated Isle, Laves Ãtna's Roots, and makes its Forges boil, Whence greater Heat and Rage the Hill acquires, Gives louder Groans, and vomits fiercer Fires: Barks hither beaten by the Tempest's Force Ingulph'd pursue a subterranean Course, Nor longer subject to the Wind's Command, Pass thro' the Channels of the cavern'd Land By which to Africk Seas th' Ionian creep, As Caspian dive to seek the Indian Deep: Hence ancient Fables, which these Seas defame And make Charybdis doubly dreadful, came. Five Times the solar Orb's indulgent Ray Had cherish'd either Hemisphere with Day, Since first they took from Napolis their Way; When fair Messina's Town began to rise, And thrust her beauteous Head amid'st the Skies. Pleas'd with the Prospect ravishing to Sight Britannia's Prince approach'd with great Delight The safe and ample Port, and landing there Did to the King's imperial Seat repair, A stately Pile that rear'd on rising Ground Proudly survey'd the Seas and Soil around. Barlan the Monarch of Sicilia's Isle Embrac'd the royal Youth, reliev'd his Toil With fit Refreshments, and with Joy exprest Marks of Distinction to his high-born Guest. This Prince renown'd to Arts of Peace inclin'd, Temp'rate, indulgent, and serene of Mind, Oppos'd the Pow'r of Luxury in vain Which thro' the Kingdom did licentious reign. The hateful Dregs of Vice now uncontroul'd In a black Deluge o'er Sicilia roll'd, While Pleasure here her conquering Banners spreads, On the soft Necks of captive Nobles treads, And ruin'd Virtue's Spoils in Triumph leads. The Nation sunk in Ease and Indolence, And studious to regale each craving Sense, Their Change of Taste with Change of Pleasure cloy, Suck every Sweet, and feast on every Joy. Soon as they waken'd from their soft Repose, All to replunge their Souls in Riot rose; With Thirst reviv'd soft Luxury renew'd Repeated old Delights and fresh pursu'd: And when the falling Sun withdrew his Ray, And to the adverse World transferr'd the Day, The wanton Tribes employ'd succeeding Night In boundless Mirth, and revell'd in Delight; While charming Musick and expensive Feasts Protracted till the Morn regal'd the Guests, And Wines and Liquors of delicious Taste, Not by Hesperia's noblest Grape surpast, Went in capacious mantling Goblets round, Drench'd their warm Veins, and all Reflection drown'd. Gay Nymphs &amp; Youths in their full Pride and Bloom Danc'd with immodest Airs along the Room, While Tongues obscene recited amorous Pains, And Love Adventures in lascivious Strains. They Bacchus now extoll, now Venus praise, And Cupid now advance in wanton Lays: Honours divine to Woodland Gods ascribe, And sing vile Anthems to th' invented Tribe Of Deities aton'd with wicked Rites, Vicious Devotion, and impure Delights. Enormous Bacchanalian Pleasures, loose Milesian Feasts and Luxury in Use Among abandon'd Sibarites, were dear To all the Natives sunk in Riot here, As they to brutal Instincts had resign'd Celestial Reason's Empire of the Mind. Their Brows adorn'd with parti-colour'd Flow'rs, They revel now in odorif'rous Bow'rs, Now in the verdant Meadows sing and dance, Or on the Stream in gilded Boats advance. On endless Mirth and wild Excess intent, Their Limbs unactive, and their Souls unbent, Mindless, they all domestick Cares disband, Forget to plant the Grove, or sow the Land: Commerce and publick Business of the State With like Reluctance they decline, and hate Charges of Weight, and each important Task, That Thought, Concern, and Application ask. Nor could they intellectual Labour bear, No Hours for Works of Erudition spare; No venerable Schools of Learning rise To form the Mind in soft Sicilia's Skies, But oscitant supine and dull of Mind Letters they mock and Sciences refin'd. Romantick Fables, which with fatal Art Diffuse soft Poison and infect the Heart, Novels and comick Writings, that inspire Immodest Thoughts and kindle wild Desire, And lyrick Labours of a wanton Cast, Only delight their vitiated Taste. Reserv'd Demeanour and a modest Air, The lovely Grace that most adorns the Fair, The sweetest Beauty of the Sex, were here Despis'd, while all affected to appear By decent Rules of Conduct unrestrain'd, Their Countenance assur'd, and never stain'd With one weak Blush, for vain Sicilia's Court Made that Plebeian Quality their Sport. The fair themselves could unoffended hear Tales the most shocking to a moral Ear, And would as flat the best Production blast, Not season'd high for this degen'rate Taste. In the sweet middle Land with Plenty crown'd A Grove sublime protects th' inchanting Ground, Where Jes'mine, fragrant Myrtle, graceful Pines, And Orange-Rows, aspire in beauteous Lines, While Day descending thro' the op'ning Glades Smiles on the Walks, and wanders thro' the Shades. Here painted Birds pleas'd with eternal Spring From Tree to Tree their Flights alternate wing, And tuneful Strains to echoing Grotto's sing. Hither lascivious Zephyrs come to load Their downy Wings, and sportive spread Abroad The odoriferous Spoils of blooming Bow'rs, And the sweet Breath of verdant Plants and Flow'rs, Which join'd, the Smell with greater Pleasure feast Than all the Gardens of the spicy East, Or burning Incense of the PhÅnix Nest. A Chrystal River thro' a smiling Plain In wanton Mazes to the Tuscan Main Now draws his Ebbing, now his refluent Train. Here the bright Turrets of the Temple rise Sacred to Pleasure mid'st the wond'ring Skies. High Silver Walls and Pillars cas'd with Gold, For Cost and Art unparallell'd, uphold Th' expanded Roof of fragrant Cedar, whence Promiscuous Glory inset Gems dispense. Here Statues stand, that seem with Breath inspir'd, Frolick with Wine, or with wild Passion fir'd, Where the surprizing artful Chizel feigns Force in the Limbs, and Spirit in the Veins. Here Venus smil'd attended with her Doves, Alluring Graces and unhallow'd Loves, Her Limbs in Marble soft look'd charming sweet, A Chaplet crown'd her Head, and at her Feet Lay prostrate Vot'ries, who embrac'd her Cause, Ador'd her Beauty, and obey'd her Laws. There next in Order pleas'd Spectators see Cupid a wanton Boy-Divinity, Her Offspring, near th' immoral Goddess stand, His Eyes encircled with a Linnen Band; He holds his fatal Bow for Action strung, And arm'd with Shafts his Quiver backward hung. Here Bacchus glows, the Clusters of the Vine Around his Brows their Purple Riches twine; This a full flowing Bowl, the other Hand, The mystick Emblem of his wide Command, The Thyrsus grasps, and o'er his Cheeks a Red That rivals fiery Carbuncles is spread: His Belly with vast Draughts of Wine opprest, And striving with the strong fermenting Guest, Streighten'd the Limits of his lab'ring Breast. There Goats-Foot lustful Satyrs laugh, and here Stand Nymphs immodest to the Goddess dear. Within, the Roof, encas'd by Azure Stone With golden Streaks distinguish'd, glorious shone, With polish'd Marble rich in curious Veins, And Porph'ry varied with surprizing Stains: Pillasters finish'd with unrivall'd Art Strength to the Pile and Elegance impart: Beneath the Ceiling hang with Blood distain'd Arms, Gauntlets, Standards, and proud Laurels gain'd From valiant Warriours, and th' inglorious Spoils Of hapless Kings, who, after martial Toils And num'rous Conquests, with Applauses crown'd, Resign'd their Pow'r and Pleasure's Empire own'd. Amidst a thousand envy'd Trophies more, That grace the Temple, Walls, and lofty Door, Here shines the mighty Macedonian's Sword, Which of the World's wide Empire made him Lord, And the fam'd Heroe's Club suspended swings, That vanquish'd Plagues and quell'd tyrannick Kings. Sweet Flow'rs of various Hue, white, blue, and red, Beauteous Profusion, o'er the Floor are spread, The Violet, Jes'mine, Rose, and blooming Pride Of Orange-Groves, whence Odours are supply'd, That Asia's Gumms, and India's Spice excell, And more regale the Goddess Pleasure's Smell. Goblets of Gold, vast Silver Vessels, Gemms, Bracelets of Pearl, and glitt'ring Diadems, The Gifts of Princes and great Potentates, Enrich the Walls and grace the lofty Gates. Besides Oblations made by all Degrees, And the sad Spoils of ruin'd Families (Lavish Donation on her Altars thrown) Th' unchaste luxurious Deity atone; In all the Pomp of Youth, and Beauty's Bloom, Clad in fine Linnen from soft Ãgypt's Loom, O'er which unrivall'd Silks their Pride display, Light as fair Clouds and as the Morning gay, She sits sublime with Flow'rs sweet-scented crown'd, A Croud of vain Adorers pour'd around, And spreading forth with wanton Airs her Arms Smiles lovely and unfolds ten thousand Charms. Which her voluptuous Votaries inspire With Thoughts impure, and kindle loose Desire. The lazy Priests that at her Altar serve, And from her grateful Precepts never swerve, Immers'd in Riot and dissolv'd in Ease Strive the immoral Deity to please. Ne'er to a Temple such vast Throngs repair, Shew warmer Zeal or more sincere an Air, Princes, who Toil and publick Care detest, And Lords of Pow'r and Wealth immense possest, Mindless of Profit, busy Life, and Fame, Crouding in long Processions hither came, Their Heads with various flow'ry Garlands grac'd, Greens in their Hands and Scarves around their Waste: With Flutes and Timbrels playing, they advance, And with lewd Joy intoxicated dance; Pamper'd with Wine and Riot they express Prophane Religion and devout Excess. These stretch'd on Down their Deity adore, Those drench'd with Surfeit round the Altar snore; Some in the verdant Walks lascivious Play, Or in the Myrtle-Groves unthoughtful stray. Some sportive on the River's Silver Tide Singing in gilded Barges wanton ride, With silken Flags display'd, and painted Oars, While beauteous Syrens on the flow'ry Shores In Order rang'd their charming Voices join, And in transporting Melody combine. Thus soft Sicilian Lords their Hours employ'd And undisturb'd with Care their Senses cloy'd, While vulgar Tribes immers'd in vain Delight Consum'd the Day in Sport, in Feasts the Night, Only sate down to eat, and rose to play, By Vice exhausted, and in Riot grey. Sage Guithun, with Amazement seiz'd to see, Such unexampled Scenes of Luxury, Thus said to AlfredâSure some heavy Fate Impends o'er this supine degen'rate State: The King of Heav'n, tho' flow to Wrath, at last With some sore Veng'ance will this People blast, With Plague or Famine sweep their Sons away, Or give them up to foreign Arms a Prey. Now Alfred went from Town to Town to view What curious Objects Nature here could shew; He pass'd the fertile Acres, where 'tis said, The Oxen sacred to the Sun were fed, And the delicious Region near the Coast, On which the Tyrrhene Sea's loud Waves are tost. He saw Trinacria's Helicon convey Its Silver Current to the spreading Bay. Then Tyndarum he view'd of ancient Fame That to the tuneful Muses gave its Name, And with proud Cities once in Beauty vy'd, Now sapp'd and ruin'd by the Ocean's Tide. Then Guithun thus beganâWhile, with Design Of gaining wide Renown by Strains divine, The Grecian Poets gen'rous chose to climb Superiour Seats, and then from Heights sublime Plung'd in the Depths of Nature to explore Surprizing Scenes and Walks untry'd before, Sicilian Muses did the Breast inspire, So ancient Poets told, with gentle Fire, And with a soft and easy Impulse raise The flowing Genius fit for lyrick Lays To sing the Flocks, the Forrests, and the Plains, The Pleasures of the Nymphs, &amp; Labours of the Swains. Alfred reply'dâThe Pagan Bards implor'd Justly those Gods, whom they sincere ador'd; But Wonder 'tis the Christian tuneful Train Such venerable Thoughts should still retain Of unexistent heav'nly Potentates, The empty Idols of the Heathen States, That in Defiance of their Founder they Senseless exploded Deities should pray Gracious to guide and animate their Flights, When they aspire to more than vulgar Heights. Then to the Eerian lofty Hills they came, For their rich Acres of unrivall'd Fame: Sicilia's Isle, the Granary, that fed Dependant Rome, the World's imperial Head, Is so exhaustless, that her teeming Soil, When scarce assisted by the Farmer's Toil, Yields gen'rous Fruits, yet not her happiest Ground Is more with Flocks and Corn and Vineyards crown'd, Than the fat Glebe, that this high Ridge surveys, Where lavish Nature Wealth immense displays. They enter'd next Leontium's fertile Plain, Where Fields excuse the Labour of the Swain, And up and down produce spontaneous Grain Unwounded with the Plough-share, and with Crops, Where till'd, exceeds the greedy Farmer's Hopes. Next they approach'd the fam'd PergÃ¦an Lake, Which ancient Bards their frequent Subject make, And sing how here their God of Darkness pleas'd With her consummate Beauty eager seiz'd Bright Proserpina, and compell'd the Fair To change for Night and Hell the lightsome Air. Well might the GrÃ¦cian Wits in Fiction bold, That useful Men among the Gods enroll'd, Fix Ceres Birth, who to the harrow'd Soil First trusted Grain, in this prolifick Isle. And then the curious Briton took his Way To the rich Land where Pagan Fables say, Fierce Anthropophagi, a cruel Race, Horrid, inhumane and obscene of Face, Cyclopian Shepherds, savage LÃ¦strigons, And Giants dwelt, the Earth's enormous Sons, Of Strength and Bulk immense, who once enrag'd Against the Gods in impious War engag'd, And made uplifted Hills and Mountains rise Torn from their Roots against th' affrighted Skies, Till thunder-struck the Warriours headlong came From their proud Heights &amp; stretch'd involv'd in Flame; Where vast TyphÅus raves and groaning lyes Beneath whole Ãtna's Weight, but never dies. To visit Ãtna's Heap and smoaking Head, Britannia's Prince his Way with Pleasure sped To high Catanea's Tow'rs, which from the Hill Ejected Fires with frequent Terrour fill, Whose lab'ring Vaults with inborn Thunder roar From struggling Vapours, undigested Oar, And fighting Elements, that wide and far Disturb the Skies with subterranean War. Soon they arriv'd at the fair City's Gate Not far remote from Ãtna's airy Height: Two Days the Heroe in Catanea staid, And pleas'd the Haven and the Town survey'd, Thence he advanc'd thro' fertile Fields, and came To Centoripe's Walls of ancient Fame. The Prince of Darkness now conceiv'd with Joy, That he successful might his Power employ The Troubler of his Empire to destroy: Then call'd the earthy, bloated Fiends, that dwell In gloomy Caves near the sad Gulph of Hell, That o'er low Damps and restless Stores preside, And wild thro' cavern'd Ground in Tempests ride; Earthquakes by fierce collected Vapours form, Inspire the Whirlwind and excite the Storm, Which while in Vaults beneath imprison'd, howl, Roar when awake, and in their Slumber growl. The Fiends appear'dâWhom thus their Prince bespoke; Alfred, whose hateful Deeds my Wrath provoke, Will, when the rising Sun reveals his Face, Advance to see this celebrated Place. But then, terrestrial active Demons, show Your mighty Pow'r in the dark Realms below: With inward Conflicts work all Ãtna's Ground, And with Convulsions shake the Soil around; Let your strong Breath on Caves of Sulphur blow, Kindle fat Oars and make the Forges glow; Disjoin the rocky Girders of the Hill, And with intestine War its Bowels fill, Till they explode hot Cinders, Smoke, and Fire, In which involv'd the Briton may expire. The Fiends obedient bow'd, and, to pursue The Task enjoin'd, in humming Swarms withdrew, And to avoid th' ungrateful Realms of Light, Shot to their low Abodes, and plung'd in Night. Now Albion's Prince in Centoripe stay'd, Which Ãtna's smoaky Furnaces survey'd, Resolv'd to view the wond'rous Scenes that Fame Hoarse with her Province labour'd to proclaim: Then, while at Noon of Night, with Toil oppress'd In Slumber's downy Arms he lay caress'd, Amel in Heav'n, as Alfred's Guardian known, By high Commission left th' Eternal's Throne, And swift as solar Emanations fly Thro' empty Gulphs and unresisting Sky, Heav'ns Envoy brighter than the brightest Flame Down the blue Precipice to Alfred came. Then gently waken'd Britain's Son, and said With gracious AirâForsake in Haste your Bed To quit this dang'rous Place, for, Alfred, know, The potent Prince of Hell, your watchful Foe, Prepares against your Life a fatal Blow. Soon as the circling Sun's projected Ray Shall gild the Mountains and renew the Day, Vindictive Fiends will by their Lord's Command With dreadful Earthquakes shake Sicilia's Land, And trouble Ãtna's Caves, whence mid'st the Skies Ejected Storms of Fire and Stones may rise Thro' horrid Mouths, and o'er the trembling Soil Spread glowing Cinders and Metallick Spoil. This Plot's imagin'd Alfred to destroy; But to defeat th' Apostates cruel Joy, From Seats of Bliss commission'd I descend Your Life from Rage infernal to defend: Then rise, Britannia's Prince, without Delay And to the Eerian Mountain's speed your Way, I'll be your faithful Guide, and lead you right, Dispell the Darkness and assist your Flight. He ceas'dâThe Briton soon Obedience paid: The Seraph Guithun and the Prince convey'd Safe to the mention'd Hill whose airy Height Affords to Ãtna's Peaks an easy Sight; Then thus bespoke themâHence, from Danger free You'll hear the Noise and dire Eruptions see: Tho' you elude th' Apostate's deep Design, Yet 'tis decreed by Providence divine To let the Fiends pursue their vengeful Toil, To scourge the Natives of this godless Isle, Lewd as Gomorrha and as Sodom vile. Tho' lull'd by Mercy's Charms stern Justice sleeps, And Wrath imprison'd in her Phiol keeps, Rous'd up at length She in the destin'd Hour On vicious Realms will ripen'd Vengeance pour. The Seraph ceas'dâThen from their Sight withdrew, And thro' the Skies on Wings immortal flew. Now had the Forces of returning Light Assail'd and put nocturnal Shades to Flight: The Sun, as conscious of the fatal Day, Shone with a waning Face and languid Ray; The stagnant Air unventilated stood, Oppress'd with lazy Reeks, and streak'd with Blood, While in the Skies prodigious Meteors hung, Wolves howl'd, and ill presaging Ravens sung; Portentous Shrieks and lamentable Cries From neighb'ring Woods and cavern'd Mountains rise; The troubled Billows foaming rush to Land, And wild Sea-Monsters yell along the Strand. Now had the Sun climb'd half his steepy Way, Rolling up Azure Heights the golden Day, When the fierce Fiends employ'd their Strength &amp; Skill To rend the Roots of Ãtna's trembling Hill. Now Sounds, like Thunder ready for the Birth, Fill the dark Prisons of the troubled Earth, Whose rocky Girders, Ribs, and Vaults profound Shake with intestine War, and all around Spread strong Concussions thro' the heaving Ground, Whence dreadful Roarings and deep Groans prelude To the vast Strife and Uproar that ensu'd: The list'ning Shepherds fear, and busy Swains Start at the Noise, and tremble on the Plains. Soon from the Hill exploded Flakes of Fire Involv'd in Clouds of Smoak to Heav'n aspire: The ruddy Oars offensive Light display, While burning Sulphur choaks the solar Ray. Such Storms, such Tempests now the Heav'ns embroil, Such Consternation struck Sicilia's Isle, As no descriptive Words have Force to teach, Nor Roman Wits can paint, nor Grecian reach; And scarce will be outrivall'd till the Day, When Heav'n and Earth dissolv'd shall melt away, And Time it self shall ceaseâWhen, Nature's Frame Sapp'd and disjointed by consuming Flame, Its beauteous Parts shall from their Order fly, And undistinguish'd in Destruction lie. The lofty Peaks at once in lab'ring Throws Spread melted Metals and unmelted Snows; Dislodge crude Minerals from their dark Abodes, And cast from hollow Caves unweildy Loads. The Mountain's working Sides, dread Sight! expell From their profoundest Gulphs and hottest Hell Uplifted Heaps and Hurricanes of Fire, Which with loud Storms of red hot Stones conspire To gain Belief, that Mortals soon should see Nature's last Pangs and dying Agony. From Marble Rocks below great Fragments torn, And missive Hills abrupt in Tempests born, Prodigious Ruin! now ejected fly Against the Azure Lines that guard the Sky. Cinders, unfinish'd Earths, and pitchy Smoke, Ashes, and Show'rs of Pumice-Stones, that broke Mingled with flaming Sulphur from the Hill, The Air and Earth with Strife and Terrour fill, While gasping Birds their Way obstructed found, And fell with burning Feathers to the Ground. The Sun that labour'd to support the Day Lost in black Fumes his suffocated Ray, And from his sick'ning Orb faint Lustre sent, While Thunder, which from Caves beneath had Vent And subterranean Lightning's fÅtid Flame Such Uproar, such a Scene of Horrour frame, As if blue Mountains rushing from on high, And Earth's hard Rocks rais'd to the middle Sky, Met, and confed'rate Forces would employ Distinction, Peace, and Order to destroy. Now Chaos Marks of secret Joy express'd, To see insulted Nature so oppress'd, And Strife and Misrule of the World possess'd. While thus discordant Elements engag'd, And Ruin War with Ruin fiercely wag'd, While Ãtna with Supplies the Combate fed, And dreadful Flames and Smoke th' Horizon spread, Thick Clouds of Ashes, which the Skies engrost Pour down unfruitful Show'rs on Libya's Coast: Torrents of rocky Fragments, fluid Oar, And Cataracts of Fire, with Fury roar Along the Mountain's Sides, and join'd below In one amazing Inundation flow. The massy Waves whole Cities overturn, At once the Flocks and Shepherds drown and burn, Demolish Tow'rs, rend from their Roots the Woods, And from their Channels raise th' exhaling Floods. Heaps of hot Cinders, and th' unductile Store Of Fossils, scorch the Land and spread the Shore; While livid Streams along the Valley creep, Rolling unborrow'd Treasures to the Deep, And, disemboguing there their pond'rous Train, Bury the Mountain's Entrails in the Main. Sea-Monsters howling from the Terrour fled, While sodden Fish swam on the Waters dead, And liquid Metals mingling with the Waves Now for marine change subterranean Caves. The Billows thinn'd and sever'd by the Heat Flew to the Clouds and left their ancient Seat; The Skies th' ascending Ocean entertain, Surpriz'd at this new Origine of Rain. Touch'd with the penal Wrath that thus defac't The fruitful Soil, and laid the Cities waste, The British Prince besought with ardent Pray'r Th' Almighty Power the suff'ring Isle to spare, To stop the Fury of th' infernal Band, And not compleat the Ruin of the Land. His Pray'r prevail'd, and by th' Almighty sent, Sicilia's whole Destruction to prevent, A beamy Envoy, like a darting Ray, Swift to the troubled Mountain wing'd his Way, And bade the wrathful Demons Vengeance stay. Reluctant they the great Command obey'd, And stopp'd th' Eruptions that such Havock made; The Sun shone bright, and peaceful was the Air, Which freed the trembling Nation from Despair. The Christian Heroe, who with Pleasure found His Supplications with Success were crown'd, To Heav'n becoming Gratitude express'd; When Guithun thus Britannia's Prince address'd. The Conflagration by the Judge supream Destin'd to ruin Nature's present Scheme By these amazing Scenes we may conceive, Which in the Mind no faint Idea leave Of those destructive Flames, that shall consume The Globe terrestrial at the general Doom. And for the Fire that shall the World invade, Remark the wond'rous Preparations made; Reflect what various burning Mountains stand In Libya's parch'd inhospitable Land: What Numbers more eject their fiery Spoils In Asia's Realms and distant India's Isles: Regard the Hills which Europeans know, Hecla, Vesuvius, Ãtna, Strombolo, That from their working Bowels vomit Flame, Besides Volcano's of inferiour Name. What burning Stores are lodg'd in barren Sands Of vast Extent in solitary Lands Scorch'd by the Sun's direct, incumbent Ray, And of their Moisture drain'd by too much Day! What plenteous fiery Fossils have their Birth In the superiour Layings of the Earth, As well in Climes with Beams indulgent bless'd, As those with fierce ungenial Heat oppress'd! See, thro' the fruitful Surface of the Ground Rich marly Veins and Hills of Chalk abound, And Heaps of Flint lie scatter'd o'er the Plains, While Beds of Sulphur and exhaustless Veins Of Coal combustible of various Kind, In various Regions lab'ring Delvers find. Of liquid Pitch what Treasures, what of dry, And what of fat Bitumen hoarded lie! Enough on fam'd Euphrates Banks alone Was found to fix, as Cement, Stone to Stone, And bind the wond'rous Walls of Babylon. Add the hot Springs and Floods, that scorch the Soil, And Baths, that with incocted Sulphur boil; Each reeking Lake, that burns, but ne'er consumes, And suffocates the Air with sultry Fumes, Like that, which drowns the execrable Land, Which impious Sodom's Tow'rs did once command; All these enclose a Stock of Heat immense, And secret Seeds of Flame embody'd, whence The destin'd Conflagration may acquire Vast Re-enforcements of collected Fire. Contemplate now what ruddy Entrails glow, What kindled Streams and smoaking Torrents flow In distant Channels and deep Vaults below. What burning Stores disturb the Gulphs profound And the vast Hollows of the central Ground! What Ãstuaries rage! what reeking Tides! What Exhalations heave their Prison's Sides! Which thro' the rocking Earth Convulsions make, And the strong Girders and Foundations shake; Whence thro' the gaping Chasms and Mountains rent Tempests of Fire and Whirlwind find a Vent. At last, so Reason dictates, as of old The Vaults profound, that liquid Treasures hold, Broke up, th' ascending Waters met with those That floated on the Surface, to compose The mighty Flood that Hills and Valleys drown'd; So now, the Globe terrestrial to confound, Vast burning Seas from Earth's profoundest Caves And Gulphs disrupt may rise in boiling Waves To join with those above, and then employ Associate Flames this Fabrick to destroy. Should all these Hoards release their Stock of Fire, And emptying all their Magazines conspire At once with Arms confed'rate to assail Nature's high Fences, must they not prevail? Then Alfred thusâLet us with Speed retreat From this abandon'd Race, this godless Seat, Lest we the dreadful Cup of Vengeance share, Which Heav'n, no longer patient, will prepare For these Abodes, where monstrous Men abound In Guilt obdurate, and in Pleasure drown'd. Then at the tender Dawning of the Day To fair Messina's Gates he took his Way To bid the Court adieu, embark, and stand His Course intended to Iberia's Land; Unheedful then, that Hell might undermine By captivating Snares his wife Design, Or that Temptation's Force might over-pow'r His Virtue's Strength in some unguarded Hour. BOOK VII. The ARGUMENT. Alfred returns to Court, designing to take Leave of the King, is received with great Marks of Respect, and while there, growing more remiss and less guarded, he tastes the Pleasures of the Place with unwarrantable Liberty. Albana descended from the royal Family, and a Person of consummate Beauty, falls in Love with the Prince, and by Degrees raises the like Passion in him, which Guithun perceiving, warns Alfred of the Danger, presses him to leave Sicily and pursue his first Design. Alfred is convinced of his Errour, resolves to correct his Conduct, and quit Messina, but breaks his Resolutions and continues fluctuating and unsteady, sometimes yielding, and sometimes getting Ground over his Passion; till seized with a dangerous Feaver, he is awakened by Reflection on approaching Death; repents of his Misbehaviour, deprecates divine Displeasure, and sincerely resolves to leave the Sicilian Court. Vpon which Amel is sent from Heaven to encourage him, and remove his Distemper. Alfred being recovered, found that his Virtue was now strong enough to put his Resolutions into Practice, and then takes Leave of the King. Albana enraged at his Design, hires Russians to kill him, but is disappointed by the Management of Mara her Friend and Confident, who herself had a Passion for Alfred. Mara substitutes Broglio in his Place, who is slain by Assassins. Mara mean Time reveals Albana's Plot against Alfred. The Prince leaves Messina, privately embarks and sails for Spain. Albana reflecting on her Order to kill Alfred, is distracted between the Passions of Revenge and Love, but the latter prevailing, she going to Alfred's Chambers to prevent his Death, meets the Assassins coming out, who tell her the Work was done, she swoons, and is carried to her Apartments, where in Anguish she stabs herself. Alfred return'd to soft Sicilia's Court, That seem'd unchang'd by the late dire Effort Which Ãtna made the Kingdom to deface, And purify by Fire th' unhallow'd Race, The Courtiers Marks of general Joy express'd; And while the Sov'reign Britain's Prince caress'd, Chiefs and superiour Officers of State, Distinguish'd Lords did on the Stranger wait Assiduous, and by Turns the Guest invite To Feasts and Scenes of exquisite Delight. Alfred intemp'rate Instincts now obey'd, While at their Banquets he unwatchful staid: Mean Time his pious Zeal began to cool, While oft he swerv'd from that celestial Rule Which he imbib'd in Virtue's sacred School. Beauteous Albana by the Mother's Side Near to Sicilia's King in Blood ally'd, The Relict of Panorma's generous Lord, For Wit and Features was by all ador'd. None in her Cheeks, from artful Graces free, Could borrow'd Bloom and Charms unnative see; But Beauties, such as in the Realms above Spring from immortal Youth and blissful Love, Like opening Roses at the Sun's Embrace Smil'd heav'nly sweet and blossom'd in her Face. No Tongue her gracious Movement can declare, Nor Words the most expressive paint the Air And winning Manner of the lovely Fair. But then beneath these various Charms she hid Habits, that heav'nly Virtue's Rules forbid: Nor did she guard her Honour free from Blame, But with repeated Guilt distain'd her Fame. She oft the Prince at publick Feasts had seen, And with his Person pleas'd, and princely Mien, Her glancing Eyes she frequent on him turn'd, His Features view'd, and as she view'd, she burn'd. Wounded she felt the soft Contagion's Pain Beat thro' her Heart and shoot thro' every Vein: By pow'rful Efforts of alluring Smiles, Expressive Looks and all-engaging Wiles, She strove to make her Love to Alfred known, And fire his Soul with Passion, like her own. Britannia's Prince, whose unexperienc'd Breast That prevalent Infection ne'er possest, The Snare eluded, and preserv'd his Heart Unmov'd by all her Charms and all her Art. Finding that Albion's Heroe could despise The silent Eloquence of Smiles and Eyes, One Day, the Season fit, she thus addrest Th' attentive Briton now her Brother's Guest, While she observ'd him singled from the Rest. The Sense, Politeness, wise and graceful Mien, Perfections which in Alfred we have seen With Wonder and Delight, illustrious Prince, Will now with Ease th' admiring World convince, That the bright Virtue's of a noble Mind To these more Southern Climes are not confin'd. Endow'd with Letters, Elegance of Taste, And courtly Manners yet by none surpast, You from a distant Isle and colder Skies Sicilia's Sons and Rome her self surprize. At their first Rising, your strong Beams display A Blaze of Glory and meridian Day: Your early Branches rich with Verdure shoot, And mingled with their Bloom bear ripen'd Fruit. These confluent Graces, which such Lustre wear, Make you th' unrivall'd Idol of the Fair: You o'er the Sex to boundless Empire born, Gain all the Beauties that the Court adorn, And with despotick Pow'r their Passions sway; Should Alfred sue what Heart can disobey? The envy'd Princess, whose superiour Charms Shall warm your Breast and win you to her Arms, Proud of the glorious Conquest of her Eyes Would match the happy Natives of the Skies. She ceas'dâAnd blushing with a modest Air Doubled her Graces and enforc'd the Snare. The Heroe, conscious of her Flame confest, Prudent conceal'd the Secret in his Breast, And thus reply'dâAlbana, were it true That these profuse Encomiums were my Due, That from immod'rate courtly Candour grow, And not from Justice but Indulgence flow; And if, assur'd none would my Suit refuse, I might the most engaging Beauty chuse, Yet bound by strict irrevocable Vows Not the most charming Princess to espouse While trav'lling I pursue my first Design, I must the great Felicity decline. Religion and Atulpho's high Commands Bid me advance and visit various Lands To form my Mind, should Empire be my Fate, To guide with skilful Hands the Helm of State. For this I chearful left my native Soil To undergo great Dangers, Care, and Toil, In Lands unknown and on unpractis'd Seas, That I my Thirst of Science might appease. Tho' Providence supream, which I adore, Enjoins me soon to leave Sicilia's Shore New States and distant Kingdoms to survey, And I the mighty Impulse must obey; No Absence, Time, or intervening Space Shall from my grateful Soul the Thoughts efface Of the high Honours here on Alfred thrown, And chiefly those by bright Albana shown. He ceas'dâThe Princess with Resentment fir'd, Which yet she cover'd artfully, retir'd. And now her Breast with warring Passions strove, An Uproar caus'd by disappointed Love, A Medly of Distress, Revenge, and Care, And Rage the genuine Offspring of Despair. She wrung her Hands, and raving beat her Breast, Now threw her self upon the Bed opprest With heavy Grief, now starting stamp'd the Ground, Fix'd her sad Eyes, or turn'd them wildly round. So when in cruel Pastime Peasants fling Their pointed Reeds, and break the vig'rous wing Of some proud Swan, the lovely Suff'rer's Cries And piteous Moans ring thro' the ambient Skies; Flutt'ring in Flight she with her Pinion beats The River's Face, and seeks the shelt'ring Seats Of the next reedy Isle, and of her Pains To Hills and Woods and murm'ring Streams complains, While from her Wound fresh vital Crimson flows Plenteous, and dyes to red her native Snows. Then thus the Princess to her self begun; Ungrateful, cruel, proud, Atulpho's Son, Hast thou Albana's Favour thus abus'd, Slighted my Charms and profer'd Love refus'd? Rejected! mock'd! my Soul is all on Fire, My tender Flames more gen'rous Heat acquire, And nobler Passions now my Breast inspire. I'll show the vain Transalpine, barb'rous Boy, That I can ruin, if I can't enjoy; That 'tis the hardest Province to asswage Love's soft Emotions, when improv'd to Rage: By me instructed, haughty Youth, believe A Woman scorn'd can ne'er th' Affront forgive. But as her Passion's high unbridled Tide, Its Fury spent, did by Degrees subside, Resolv'd by fresh Efforts to prove her Fate She artful dress'd a new ensnaring Bait: Then in a chosen Season she address'd Britannia's Prince, and thus her Thoughts express'd. Alfred, I know, that you prepare to leave Sicilia's slighted Kingdom, and bereave Her troubled Natives of the vast Delight That thro' the Court and City you excite, In Virtue rich and Ornaments divine, That all imperial Pomp and Pow'r out-shine. But chief our Beauties will their Fate bewail, By their weak Charms unable to prevail And soften Alfred's adamantine Breast, And scorn'd Albana sad above the rest Will secret weep, or fill the conscious Air With the sad Accents of extream Despair; While on the sandy Margin of the Main With Hands to Heav'n uplifted we in vain To Winds and Waves and echoing Rocks complain. Can blooming Youth inviting Bliss deny? From Seats of Joy to Scenes of Horrour fly? All the Delights and Pride of Life postpone To barb'rous Kingdoms and to Seas unknown, To Scythia's Snows or Libya's burning Zone? She saidâAnd then to win the Royal Prize Smil'd lovely, and, with fascinating Eyes And all engaging Airs and Arts combin'd, She studious strove to captivate his Mind. Th' Assailant stood collected in her Charms Darting against the Prince her piercing Arms, And overwhelm'd him with a gushing Blaze Of Beauty, and a Burst of dazling Rays. And now, this pow'rful Effort made, the Fair Left Albion's Prince to struggle with the Snare. Nor did the bright Aggressor miss her Aim, For Britain's Son perceiv'd a secret Flame, And felt the vital Force of quick'ning Love; And now his Spirits by the Impulse move Of the new Guest, while soft unpractis'd Pains Throb in his Breast and thrill along his Veins. Th' unknown Contagion with a pleasing Smart Beats thro' his Nerves and vibrates in his Heart. Now changing Cheeks, by Turns from pale to red, Confess'd the gentle Wound that inward bled. Sometimes he started up as in Surprize, And sometimes rigid stood, and fix'd his Eyes; While the new Pow'r impatient of Controul Rais'd this seditious Tumult in his Soul, Reason, thy Pow'rs imperious Love obey, Or own at best a weak, divided Sway. As when on Indian Plains a Rattle-Snake Perches a Red-Bird in a shady Brake, The wily Serpent from his Eyes conveys A splendid Show'r of captivating Rays; The Bird enchanted cannot turn his Sight, Nor from the bright Destroyer take his Flight; But to the Ground he falls, and panting lies Still gazing on the Charmer, tho' he dies. So Alfred felt th' Infection in his Heart, And conscious of its Poison hugg'd the Dart, Now Passion's Tide retires at Reason's Frown, Now rushes back and bears Reflection down; It this and that Way in his Bosom roll'd, By Turns prevailing and by Turns controul'd. At Court-Assemblies oft he met the Fair, Nor could he but in Pain her Absence bear; Hence oft impatient he Albana sought, And, when he found the Idol of his Thought, A Stress of Joy did in his Bosom rise, Bound thro' his Heart, and sparkle in his Eyes; His Spirits sprung and with redoubled Force Shot thro' their Roads and brighten'd in their Course. Profuse Delight, when she was present, shown, And gay Demeanour in the Prince unknown, Repeated Visits, and protracted Stay, Conspiring Signs, victorious Love betray; And tho' he thought that Conquest he conceal'd, His every Look the secret Wound reveal'd, And his disorder'd Temper plain confest The Pow'r that rul'd his Soul and broke his Rest. But tho' this Passion he unwary feeds, He yet resolv'd that no forbidden Deeds Should on his Conduct leave a guilty Stain, Determin'd still his Virtue to maintain. Albana, Mistress of th' engaging Art, Saw her self Victor of the Heroe's Heart, And, with the Triumph of her Beauty pleas'd, Felt the fierce Conflict in her Breast appeas'd: Nor did she cease to prosecute her Aim, But rais'd by perfect Skill the Briton's Flame. And now conspicuous genuine Marks convince Sicilia's Courtiers, that Britannia's Prince Was by Albana smit, whilst he in vain Strove to suppress his self-discovering Pain. Guithun mean Time, whose watchful Eye discern'd Alfred's Disorder first, the Fountain learn'd Whence it deriv'd its Rise, and had in View The fatal Danger ready to ensue. To extricate the Heroe, and defeat The threat'ning Mischief by a wise Retreat, No longer he his prudent Scheme delay'd, But thus to touch the Briton's Heart essay'd. Indulgent Alfred, my important Care, My free Discourse with wonted Candour hear. Duty, and Love, and Gratitude, extort, To cure your erring Judgement, this Effort. My Prince I fear has with too strong a Taste Of late th' Enjoyments of the Court embrac't: Nipt by this wanton Isle's malignant Air, The lovely Bloom your Virtue's us'd to bear Begins to languish, and your heav'nly Light That shone out strong and dazling to the Sight, Involv'd in Vapours looks less pure and bright. Think how the Pontiff with paternal Care Pray'd and advis'd you wisely to beware Of Beauty's Charms, and Pleasure's fatal Snare. Since you first yielded to Temptation's Force, And then pursu'd your late voluptuous Course, Is not a sensual Tincture thro' your Mind Deeply diffus'd, by which 'tis now inclin'd Not heav'nly, but terrestrial Bliss, to chuse, Pursue low Pleasures, and sublime refuse! While Plays, and Sports, and Banquets, you frequent On soft Sicilia's Luxury intent, Can you maintain your Intercourse above By vig'rous Efforts of celestial Love And lively Hope? Say, can you now adore And praise the Pow'r supream, and as before Taste gen'rous Pleasures and divine Delight? Say, can your Mind to Heav'n direct her Flight In ardent Anhelations? Can she rise From these low Regions to possess the Skies, And hold a sacred Correspondence there? Does she not flag and hang in cloudy Air, Or sordid cling to this dark Planet's Face, And clasp Pollution with impure Embrace? Does not the conscious Pow'r, the Judge within, With Frowns and awful Menaces begin To fill you with Remorse and secret Fear? Can you before th' Almighty's Throne appear, And his impartial Scrutiny abide, Or from his searching Eye your Errour hide? Besides, while you with Pleasure have been charm'd Unvigilant and of your Guard disarm'd, Albana not for moral Honour fam'd Has by her Beauty's Charms your Heart inflam'd: This secret is no more, Men speak it free, Nor can you veil what all around you see. Oh! Alfred, where will this Deportment end? The most destructive Evils must attend A Conduct (if pursu'd) so ill begun, Alfred is lost, and Albion is undone. By Distance screen'd and shelter'd safe beware How you approach too near th' alluring Snare. If you to nice Distinctions have Resort, And on the Frontier of Destruction sport, On Virtue's utmost Bounds, you'll miss your Way, And thro' a Maze of Vice and Errour stray. Never uncautious rashly tempt your Fate, But dread the Hook hid in th' enticing Bait; Would you maintain unblemish'd Virtue? still Shun dubious Things, as well as plainly ill. Tho' now, 'tis true, the strong Temptation's Force Suspends Religion, and diverts its Course; Yet still the Pow'r that chiefly rules your Soul, And will I trust your future Life controul, Is heav'nly Virtue, which, tho' now opprest It sleeps a while unactive in your Breast, Will, rous'd and waken'd by a conscious Sting, From its elastick self-recov'ring Spring New Strength acquire, and re-instated gain Its former Empire and o'er Passion reign. He ceas'dâPrince Alfred, who began to melt, Soon strong Emotions in his Bosom felt, And while to right Reflection he return'd, He saw his Folly and his Errour mourn'd: And now convinc'd he had too far comply'd, And on his Virtue's Strength too much rely'd, Firm he resolv'd his Conduct to correct, To shun ensnaring Luxury, neglect Th' engaging Fair, and, arm'd with Reason, wrest Her beauteous Image wholly from his Breast. Guithun was ravish'd in the Prince to find So good a Taste, and so dispos'd a Mind: Then press'd him to forsake Sicilia's Isle, And change soft Pleasure for instructive Toil. Alfred assents, determin'd to pursue His great Design, and yet new Kingdoms view: But Alfred was not conscious how the Heart Is faithless, and from Vows inclin'd to start: Moral Intentions, form'd in Heat and Haste, O'erpow'r'd by youthful Instinct cannot last. Soon as at Court by Chance he met the Fair, Won by her Graces and alluring Air, He felt the secret Fire begin to burn, Which now o'er Reason triumph'd in its Turn. Decrees, that he believ'd would keep the Field And ne'er again to tempting Objects yield, In ignominious Weakness at the Sight Of the resistless Foe were put to Flight. Now did the Prince Albana's Charms adore, With the same Ardour which he shew'd before; And, by his Mien and Looks and Words, confest That Love restor'd reign'd Victor in his Breast. But when by Night on Bed he sought Repose, Tumultuous Thoughts thick in his Soul arose Stung with Reflection, while with Shame he view'd His broken Vows, and felt his Flame renew'd: Then he resolv'd to shun th' alluring Bait, But soon relaps'd, and urg'd again his Fate. Now Love and Reason Alfred's Heart divide, The ruling Pow'r not fix'd on either Side: The Dictates now of Prudence he obeys, And conquering Passion now the Heroe sways, Who oft with unsuccessful Efforts try'd To quell the Tyrant, which his Force defy'd. When he Albana sees, with Beauty charm'd, Won by a Smile and by a Glance disarm'd Of all his Vows, his Weakness he betrays, And melts, like Wax, before the solar Rays: But when alone attentive and sedate He views his Virtue's fluctuating State, He mourns the Fault he wants a Heart to mend, And does by Turns repent, by Turns offend. Perplex'd unequal Life! so Men, that game, When Losers rave and their ill Fortune blame, Then vow, with Hands uplifted to the Sky, They'll touch no more the Card, nor throw the Die; Till caught again by the same tempting Bait, Again they try, and curse again their Fate. Great are their Streights whose adverse Instincts reign With equal Force, and doubtful War maintain: Oft pious Paths they keep, and oft forsake, Repeat their Vows, and break the Vows they make: They conquer now, and now the Battle lose, Not wholly Vice, nor wholly Virtue chuse. As near the Cape, or Taprobana's Coast Where the wild Waves of orient Seas are tost, If Hurricanes or wild Tornadoes rise And breaking spread loud Terrour thro' the Skies, In furious War Winds opposite engage, And with Success alternate spend their Rage; While prevalent by Turns the Rivals share The litigated Empire of the Air: So Alfred fed intestine doubtful Strife, And full of Anguish past distracted Life; Tho' urg'd by Guithun oft to break away From this luxurious Isle, still would he stay, Inventing new Excuses for Delay. Amel mean Time commission'd from above To stop the Growth of rash pernicious Love, Descending from on high thro' liquid Skies, With rapid Pinions to Sicilia flies. Now Night prevail'd when he the Briton found: While Sleep's soft Chains his yielding Senses bound, Unseen the Angel darted at his Breast A pointed livid Flame, that soon possest The Seats of Life, fill'd every Limb with Pains, His Heart with Anguish, and with Heat his Veins. His Orders thus the Minister obey'd, Then to regain the Heav'ns his Wings display'd. The Prince in restless Agitations turn'd From Side to Side, and, while his Body burn'd In the fierce Feaver's Flame, he pass'd the Night Watching with eager Eyes returning Light. With the hard Labour of a panting Breast, Aches acute, and raging Thirst opprest, Fetching repeated Sighs the Briton lay, Till the bright Sun had finish'd half the Day. Archon, whose Praises for consummate Skill Sicilia's Court and grateful Cities fill, Just Methods takes and gen'rous Druggs ordains To cool the Fire and mitigate the Pains. But still the sharp Disease new Force acquir'd, For Time, as well as Med'cine, is requir'd To aid succumbent Nature, and appease Seditious Ferments now, now Torment ease. Six Times the Sun by Turns his Face reveal'd And to each adverse World by Turns conceal'd, While restless Alfred languish'd on his Bed, And in his Veins the secret Poison fed. Now trembling Pulse, deep Groans, and double Sighs Which from opprest and sinking Nature rise, Sickness at Heart, and short unequal Breath, Seem'd ill presaging Messengers of Death. The Heroe held in this suspended State, Anxious of Mind and doubtful of his Fate, And setting vast Eternity in View, And Scenes of Life that after Death ensue, The awful Day that shall, with just Regard To Vice and Virtue, punish and reward, Delib'rate Thoughts on his late Conduct turns, And with Displeasure from Reflection burns. For now the Worm, that circling lay at rest, By this Affright awaken'd in his Breast Unfolds his Volumes and erects his Crest: Then all enrag'd, exerting double Force, Wounds deep his Soul and stings him with Remorse. Thus rous'd the contrite Heroe now repents, O'erwhelm'd with Grief and Shame his Guilt laments, And, with Confession and repeated Pray'r, Implor'd the Judge the Penitent to spare. To Guithun, standing by with Woe oppress'd, In troubled Accents thus the Prince address'd; Guithun, my Friend, my wise and faithful Guide, Had I with thy divine Advice comply'd, I had not felt these Terrours in my Mind, But unreluctant had my Life resign'd To Heav'n's Decree; but oh! 'tis now too late, Guilt makes me startle at approaching Fate. Distracted in my Thoughts I trembling lie Doubtful of Life and ill prepar'd to die. Offended Justice frowns, how much I fear Before th' august Tribunal to appear! In deeper Colours this my Guilt displays, And in Proportion should my Sorrow raise, That I, who storms of fiery Vengeance saw Which on my Soul impress'd a solemn Awe, Should soon forget those Scenes of Wrath divine, And, stupid grown, from Virtue's Paths decline. But should th' eternal Mind, whom I implore, Gracious my pristine State of Health restore, âMy sacred Vows sincerely I renew Religion's heav'nly Precepts to pursue With ardent Zeal, and fly this dang'rous Land Where reigning Vice enjoys such wide Command, Where fatal Nets o'erspread th' insidious Ground In Riot drench'd and in loose Pleasures drown'd. He ceas'dâAnd prudent Guithun thus replies, Grief in his Breast and Pity in his Eyes. Whene'er a contrite Criminal laments Contracted Guilt, indulgent Heav'n repents Of threaten'd Vengeance, and to Justice slow Lets fall his lifted Arm, and drops the Blow; Mercy divine displays her heav'nly Charms, And meets Returners with expanded Arms: Then in th' Almighty's promis'd Aid confide, On this in vain no Penitent rely'd. If you no more your erring Steps allow, But your griev'd Soul in deep Contrition bow To the great Being Nature's causeless Cause, Who rules the World by just and equal Laws, By the Redeemer's Merit, Alfred, know, Not by your own, he will propitious grow: Then to the Pow'r supream your Will resign, For if, by Death decreed, he should confine Your Body to the Tomb, your Mind will rise To endless Bliss, and triumph in the Skies; Alfred will sure (to this safe Refuge fly,) Live to his Praise, or in his Favour die. The Prince reply'dâMy Crimes disarm my Soul Of wonted Firmness, and her Pow'rs controul: Frenzy it is, not Courage, to engage Th' Almighty Being and provoke his Rage By bold Defiance, on his Thunder press, And rush on Arms divine; in my Distress I chuse to importune, as you advise, The Judge supreme with penitential Cries; I'll justify the Rod, and not arraign, That wounds my Body and inflicts my Pain. I ask for Mercy at th' Almighty's Feet, And may perhaps divine Compassion meet: But still whate'er is my determin'd Fate, It never impious Murmurs shall create: Still on th' Eternal's Goodness I rely, Living I love, and trust him if I die. His ardent Pray'r strove thro' the void Abyss To the sublime Abodes of Peace and Bliss, And like a balmy Cloud of Incense rose Whence thro' the happy Skies sweet Odour flows: This the great Intercessour, who alone Can by his Merits Wrath divine atone, Presented gracious to the Father's Throne. He thus appeas'd express'd his high Command That Amel swift should gain Sicilia's Land And heal the Briton; he without Delay Quick, as a golden Sun-beam, wing'd his Way. He reach'd the Isle and to the Prince address'd With trembling Pulse and Death-like Sweat oppress'd: And thus he saidâBriton, my tender Care, Th' Almighty Being, who has heard your Pray'r, Will Alfred's threaten'd Life indulgent save, And gracious disappoint th' expecting Grave. This Med'cine in my Hand shall Health assure, Asswage your Feaver, and compleat your Cure. Then to the painful Boil with Speed apply This wholsome Gumm, and Alfred shall not dye. He saidâAnd with a mild angelick Mien Retir'd, and mounted to the World unseen. Guithun the Sov'reign Drugg extended o'er Soft Sattin, and apply'd it to the Sore, Which ripen'd by the healing Vertue broke, And gave the Poison vent,âThen Alfred spoke To Guithun thusâI find my sharp Disease Remov'd, and Nature feels returning Ease: New vital Vigour animates my Heart, And active Spirits thro' my Sinews dart. Now he his God, who the bright Seraph sent His Fate by timely Succour to prevent, Devoutly prais'd, and his great Name ador'd Who to his Body Health at once restor'd, And to his Mind Tranquillity and Rest: Then with an ardent Zeal these Words exprest; Since gracious Heav'n has from my Soul the Night Dispell'd, and open'd my suspended Sight Whence I my Stains with Shame and Sorrow view, Bear Witness I my solemn Vows renew Celestial Virtue's Dictates to pursue. Should I Britannia's Crown imperial wear This firm Decree delib'rate I declare; Acts of Religion, sacred Pray'r and Praise Which pious Minds by heav'nly Commerce raise. Affairs of high Importance that relate To the Defence and Glory of the State, Decrees of Justice, and domestick Care, Shall all my Hours in settled Order share. Th' Approach of Death thus cures an erring Mind, Teaches the Deaf to hear, to see, the blind: Confine the Youth, that makes forbidden Joys And sensual Pleasure his immoral Choice, Let him in Pain and threat'ning Sickness lye, While his despairing Friends stand weeping by, And while he draws in Sobs unequal Breath, And grows acquainted with instructive Death, How soon convinc'd will he his Crimes confess? What diff'rent Notions will his Mind possess? How will he now soft Pleasure's Charms despise, While he reviews them with enlighten'd Eyes! Nor Sports, nor Women, nor th' enchanting Bowl, Will please his Taste or captivate his Soul: Thus Rays divine, and intellectual Light, Dawn from the Grave, and break from gloomy Night. Alfred, his florid Looks and Strength restor'd, Address'd with high Respect Sicilia's Lord, And, for his princely Favours shewn exprest, The worthy Passion of a grateful Breast: In lively Words then bade the Court adieu, Determin'd soon Sea-Labours to pursue. To fair Albana busy Fame reveal'd Th' important News no longer now conceal'd: She finding Alfred was no more her Slave, Defeated of her Aim began to rave; And her outragious Sorrow to abate, Asswage her tort'ring Pain, and sooth her Hate By deep and sweet Revenge, she studious bent Her Genius rich in Mischief to invent With black infernal Art some Project sure, The Heroe's swift Destruction to procure. Now in her Mind she various Schemes revolv'd, And on the Russian's Steel at length resolv'd: For here great Numbers Wounds clandestine give For annual Stipends, and by Murder live. From this inhumane execrable Band, Ready for Slaughter at their Lord's Command, She chose out four that should their Arms employ The British Prince in secret to destroy. Mara, of noble Birth, in Blood ally'd And in strict Friendship to Albana ty'd Was near her Heart, and priviledg'd to know Her private Life, as well the Scenes of Woe As of Delight; besides she knew the Fair Did to the Briton warm Affection bear. To her Albana had the Secret told How she disclos'd her Passion, and how cold To her discover'd Love the Prince appear'd, And how unmov'd her tender Story heard; Till by Degrees the long resisted Dart Enter'd his Breast and pierc'd his yielding Heart. He then, she said, his pleasing Wound declar'd, But for Albana now owns no Regard. Without addressing me, whom he before Did as the Idol of his Soul adore, Cruel he seeks to leave Messina's Shore. Then her Resentment fully she display'd, And told the vengeful Scheme her Wrath had laid. Mara, who Albion's Prince admir'd and lov'd, With a feign'd Joy the black Design approv'd, Flatt'ring her Rage, but with conceal'd Intent Albana's bloody Purpose to prevent. This to accomplish she with Care oppress'd To Broglio, sprung from noble Blood, address'd. He Mara's Brother had perfidious slain, And oft had profer'd Love to her in vain. Broglio, said she, would you by Deeds attest That Flame sincere which you have oft profest, Gain my Esteem by granting my Request. Alfred oblig'd to pass the following Night With one of high Extraction in Delight, Has ask'd, that she would some fit Youth engage, Alike in Stature and alike in Age, On the Britannick Prince's Bed to lye, And thus elude attentive Guithun's Eye. This Scheme to sooth two Passion's Mara wrought, While to avenge her Brother's Death she sought, And guard the Briton's Life from threat'ning Harms, And disappoint th' Assassin's barb'rous Arms. Broglio, impatient to oblige the Fair, Comply'd, unconscious of the hidden Snare, And to th' Apartment secret took his Way Where for Repose the Briton constant lay, And, to obtain bright Mara for his Bride, In Alfred's Bed he Alfred's Place supply'd, Where, from th' Assassins ent'ring swift the Room, The hapless Youth receiv'd another's Doom; Stabb'd in soft Slumber he resign'd his Breath, And chang'd its Image into real Death. Ere this fell out the Secret Mara told To Albion's Prince, and did the Plot unfold Against his Life, then urg'd him to retreat With Speed from this inhospitable Seat. Her Words obtain'd Belief, the Prince revolv'd A while th' important Subject, then resolv'd Soon to embark, and change Sicilia's Isle For Seas less dang'rous, and securer Soil. Mara, with Airs that tender Nature move And all th' engaging Eloquence of Love, Earnest Britannia's Heroe now addrest To bid her live by granting this Request; That she his future Fortunes might attend, And near his Person Life remaining spend; To win him to consent, and gain his Heart, She urg'd her ardent Passion, and the Part She generous acted with successful Art, While she contriv'd that Alfred might not feel Plung'd in his Breast th' Assassin's fatal Steel: And hop'd her Beauty, Wit, and blooming Age, When thus assisted would his Soul engage; But in her Story Broglio's Fate supprest, Assur'd the Heroe would that Deed detest. Here Briton's Prince his grateful Sense declar'd Of Mara's Care and Vigilance to ward Th' impending Blow against his Life design'd, Who thus enrag'd Albana countermin'd. Then saidâControul'd by Albion's King's Command And solemn Vows, I must your Suit withstand; And as I dare not feed forbidden Love, So now I cannot Conjugal approve. Then he repeated to her Merit due His Thanks unfeign'd, and bade a long adieu. Bent to depart before, and now appriz'd Of the black Scheme against his Life devis'd By the vindictive Fair, the Prince withdrew Secret from Court his Purpose to pursue. Then on a Ship made ready in the Bay The British Pair embark, soon Anchor weigh, And to a prosp'rous Wind the Sail display. The Plan adjusted Alfred to destroy, Albana felt a while distemper'd Joy, While in her Bosom for Dominion strove Rival Emotions, fierce Revenge and Love; Like adverse Tides, or Storms of Wind engag'd In furious Conflict, her wild Passions rag'd. Now did Revenge her swelling Breast controul, And with its Vipers sting and urge her Soul, When thus she saidâBriton! thy Fate's decreed, To injur'd Love thou shalt a Victim bleed. The Poniard's Point shall more successful prove To pierce thy Heart, than the soft Dart of Love. Methinks I see the brave Assailant stand Grasping his bright Steeletto in his Hand Ready to strike the Blow, and make thee feel Fix'd in thy wounded Veins the fatal Steel. I see, I see Thee agonizing lye, Delightful Sight! bleed, Traytor, bleed and die. I hear thy deep-fetch'd Sighs and double Breath, Thy Sobs and Groans, and see Thee strive with Death. How do convulsive Throws thy Sinews rack, Thy Members quiver, and thy Heart-strings crack! How do thy rolling Eye-balls search the Light, Swim in thick Mists and sink in endless Night! Voluptuous Scene! what high Delight it brings! From just Revenge what rapt'rous Pleasure springs! This Tempest scatter'd, Love, before restrain'd, Its Force exerted and Dominion gain'd. Lovely the Prince did to her Thoughts return, Reviv'd her Flame, and made it fiercer burn: His godlike Image to her Mind endear'd, His beauteous Form, and blooming Youth appear'd: And hence the Princess tender grew, and felt Her yielding Heart with soft Compassion melt. Then thus she saidâMy Orders I repent; Must Alfred die?âNo, I'll his Fate prevent. Indignant Love insults my Mind, and now How much the Tragick Scheme I disavow? I feel my Soul with Horrour backward start; Shall I destroy by base revengeful Art The chief Delight, the Idol of my Heart? I'm wild, distracted, tortur'd with Debate; I have decreed, yet would reverse his Fate, At once the Object of my Love and Hate. Arm'd with vindictive Fury could I wrest His dear yet odious Image from my Breast, I should not wish my Orders to recall, But see him die and triumph in his Fall. But while my Passion rules I must the Steel, That pierces his, in my own Bosom feel. Why does Albana undetermin'd stand? If Alfred bleeds by my unjust Command, Of Life impatient I must Death implore To ease my Anguish, and my Peace restore. Should Alfred die, no more I Being own, What is the joyless Name? the Bliss is gone: I must repair to Hills and lonesome Woods, Or sighing wander by the murm'ring Floods: Now meet the howling Wolf and grisly Bear, Companions savage as my wild Despair: Now on the sandy Shores complaining creep, Lull'd with the whirling Gulphs, and stormy Deep; Musick becoming my delightless State, If I prevent not godlike Alfred's Fate. But then reflecting on her slighted Charms, And his Refusal of her proffer'd Arms, Tho' he had oft in lively Words confess'd The soft Contagion that his Heart possess'd; And how to see Albana he declin'd, And now to quit Sicilia's Coast design'd; Unbridled Fury soon began to burn With Flames reviv'd, and triumph'd in its Turn. Thus fierce Revenge and melting Pity strove For Empire in her Breast, till tender Love, The most prevailing Instinct of the Soul, Its rival Passion did at length controul; And then she cry'dâMy Orders I recall, If 'tis not now too lateâThe Briton's Fall I must preventâIn this indulgent View To Alfred's Rooms she with her Servants flew. The Leader of the mercenary Band, Grasping his bloody Poniard in his Hand, Met the impatient Princess at the Door And cry'dâ'Tis doneâProud Alfred is no more: See, there he welters in his flowing Gore. The Princess mutt'ring faintly, Furies! Hell! Swooning away as Planet-smitten fell Into her Servants Arms, who weeping bear Sinking Albana back with tender Care: Reviv'd with burning Gumms and fragrant Oyl Her Spirits reassum'd their vital Toil. The Princess now, Attendants sent away, Distress'd in anxious Thoughts extended lay, As meditating Slumber on her Bed Of softest Down with broider'd Scarlet spread. Conscious Reflections gave her deadly Pain, With frightful Visions fill'd her lab'ring Brain, And in her Soul with Guilt polluted bred Remorse and Horrour and amazing Dread. While, as she thought, she saw the Briton stand With open Breast, and shewing with his Hand The deep and ghastly Wound that reach'd his Heart, How did her shudd'ring Soul with Terrour start! Then thus she saidâAssist me, bold Despair, Let me no longer breathe the vital Air; Life is a Burden now too great to bear. Then rising up with heavy Grief opprest, She plung'd her Poniard deep within her Breast; And while her Heart in agonizing Strife Quiver'd, and felt the Pangs of ebbing Life, Her misty Eyes swam in prevailing Night, Catch'd dubious Day, and hung on parting Light. BOOK VIII. The ARGUMENT. Alfred sails from Sicily, and steers his Course for Spain. The Coast of Italy by which he passed described, excepting the Part before mentioned between Ostia and Naples. Passing the Streights into the Atlantick Ocean, be stood for the Mouth of the BÃ¦tis, or Quadalquivir, the River on which Hispalis, or Seville is built. Satan raises another Tempest, that forced the Prince back, and compelled him to land in the Evening on the Coast of Africa; where he and Guithun shelter'd themselves in a neighbouring Grove till the next Morning. While Alfred slept, to encourage him for future Labours and hazardous Adventures, Amel descending from above, mounts with him in a Vision to Heaven, and shews him that blissful Place. Then carries him down, and gives him a Prospect of Tophet or Gehenna, the Prison of condemned Criminals. While they ascend from these Seats, the Angel takes Occasion on the Way to let Alfred know what Revolutions and various Changes of the royal Lines shall happen in Albion till the present Times: That done Amel places him as he thought again in the Grove, and then withdraws. Alfred awakens from the Vision, which leaves deep Impression on his Mind. In Air serene swift o'er the peaceful Main Push'd by propitious Winds they steer'd for Spain: While high Messina's Turrets backward flew, And smoaking Ãtna's sinking Peaks withdrew, They spoon'd away, and, with wide Sails display'd To catch the breathing Force, their Passage made, And with sharp Keels and Streamers waving high Wounded at once the Deep and swept the Sky. Advancing o'er the Billows soon they lost The Towns and Tow'rs on soft Hesperia's Coast, Which with Delight the Britons view'd before, Coasting to Naples from fair Ostia's Shore. Now on the Tyrrhene foaming Sea they stood Steady their destin'd Course, and plough'd the Flood Fam'd from the Prince that for Lavinia's Charms Flew o'er its Waves from slighted Dido's Arms, To found a Pow'r that should from Pole to Pole, From Sun to Sun the Subject World controul. Then with auspicious Gales they pass'd the Land, Where Pisa's Domes and lofty Castles stand, A City, whilst with civil Freedom crown'd, Frequent of People and for Wealth renown'd, Potent by Land and Sea; but since the Yoke Of Servitude her Strength and Spirit broke, She languishes, she hangs her weeping Head, And mourns her Riches and her Children fled: Now Trav'llers Moss in stately Buildings meet, And tread on springing Grass in every Street. Next thro' the wide Ligustick Sea they steer'd, Where Genua's Tow'rs sublime in Air appear'd Dusky and in blue Distance almost lost, Extended on Hesperia's crooked Coast. Such are the Wealth and Beauties of the Town, It vies with Cities of the first Renown, Tho' hewn from solid Rocks by Toil and Art, While the proud Walls and Buildings seem to start From Marble Hills, whose Peaks transfigur'd rise In glitt'ring Spires and Turret's midst the Skies. Then thro' the Gallick Seas they made their Way, Where, Rhodanus, thy Streams their Tribute pay To the wide Deep, which their moist Treasures owe To Alpine Mountains and to weeping Snow. So the sad Nymph, as said by ancient Fame, Dissolv'd in Tears a running Flood became; And where Massilia, with Abundance blest Fetch'd from the Shores of Egypt and the East, Its tow'ry Pride on winding Land displays, And with its Arms the peaceful Waves embays. Next near the Coast the Voyagers were born Which fam'd Monspelia's Palaces adorn, Whose skilful Sons and salutary Air Raise vital Flame, and broken Health repair; Delicious Seat! where all the neighb'ring Soil Smells sweet with Flow'rs, and flows with Wine &amp; Oyl. Then sailing thro' the Balearick Deep With great Delight Iberia's Coast they sweep, Where Barcelona's Turrets rise sublime, O'erlook the Shore, and Heights etherial climb; Of Catalonia's Kings th' imperial Seat, Who great in Arms did Victors long defeat Invading Pow'rs, and reign'd in Wealth and Ease Potent by Land, and Sov'reigns of the Seas. And now they pass'd the narrow rushing Tide, Whose Waves th' Iberian from the Moor divide, And left behind the celebrated Land, Where the Herculean fabled Pillars stand, Confining on th' extended Western Main, And on the North oppos'd to spacious Spain; Which elder Ages as the Bounds regard Of the known World, that further Progress barr'd. Then to the River's Mouth they steer'd away, Where, Hispalis, thy Tow'rs their Pride display, Double the Sun-beam and reflect the Day. Now while, with Thought intent and anxious Care, The Prince that rules the Empire of the Air Patrolling travers'd swift the vacant Space, Rang'd Azure Gulphs, and flew from Place to Place His Provinces and Frontiers to review, And learn if Demons to his Orders true Perform'd their Tasks, in Anguish he descry'd The Briton's Ship advancing on the Tide. As gath'ring gloomy Storms that heavy rise Loure with a threat'ning Aspect in the Skies, So frown'd th' Apostate, dreadful to behold, And his fierce Eyes in stern Defiance roll'd. Then to himself he saidâDoes Alfred still My Rage vindictive and infernal Skill Escape, and tho' with watchful Zeal pursu'd Defeat my Pow'r, and well-laid Plots elude? Can't all the Force and Stratagems of Hell, Nor all our Fiends this hateful Briton quell? Are we exhausted? is our Vengeance drain'd? No; since my Empire here is unrestrain'd, Room yet is left to check th' ambitious Boy, The Pleasure to afflict I'll still enjoy. And then he call'd the Demons of the Air, To whom he saidâA Tempest swift prepare, And drive the Briton from Iberia's Shore To the parch'd Regions of the tawny Moor. Th' obsequious Fiends their Monarch's will obey'd, And active Meteor's midst the Heav'ns convey'd, Which, there assembled, might a Tempest grow, And pour their Rage on Hell's immortal Foe; Force back his Vessel from Iberia's Soil, Distress the Heroe, and renew his Toil. Collected Vapours now the Skies deform, And hollow whistling Gusts denounce the Storm, Which furious from the North ascending drew Its sable Train o'er Heav'n's extinguish'd Blue: While must'ring Clouds, such as pale Sailers dread, With awful Gloom the wide Horizon spread, Whose dusky Fleeces drown the solar Light, Suppress the Day and cause untimely Night; Incumbent Gales hard on the Ocean bear, Weigh up the Deep, and drive it thro' the Air. Now diff'rent Winds in Hurricanes maintain Outragious Combate, and alternate reign; Extream Distress afflicted Nature shows, Her Center shaking with tempestuous Throws, While by impulsive Force emerging Waves Regurgitate from trembling rocky Caves, Whence fighting Tides and dreadful Whirlpools rise, And Floods uplifted climb the steepy Skies. Wild Horrour, Mis-rule, Noise, and Strife confound The Air, the Ocean, and the Heav'ns around, Howl in the Woods and from the Hills rebound. Now while the raging Seas resistless Shocks And furious Frets of Wind too near the Rocks The Vessel Force, and now while adverse Gales, That blowing from the Shore fill'd out the Sails, Impell'd it back, the Crew uncertain stand, Whether the Ship disdainful of Command Would founder in the Deep, or perish on the Strand. Then Amel swift descending from above, As order'd, thro' the Skies inferiour drove The Demons that with Clouds efface the Day, Sport in loud Thunder, and in Tempests play. Aw'd by the Serapah's Frown they took their Flight, Bore off the Storm, and eas'd the Sailer's Fright. And now succeeds a soft Favonian Breeze, That curl'd the Floods, and gently shook the Trees. The Heav'ns, the wild seditious Uproar sooth'd, Serenely smil'd, and the calm Ocean smooth'd His furrow'd FaceâThen did the Men descry A Creek where Vessels might at Anchor lye. To this safe Bay their leaky Ship they thrust And plac'd on Pow'r divine religious Trust: Then prais'd kind Heav'n, and leaping on the Shore With Pray'r devout they future Aid implore. The solar Orb withdrawn, by doubtful Light They spy'd a neighb'ring Grove, to pass the Night Beneath the shelt'ring Trees they took their Way, And there decreed to wait th' Approach of Day. Their Strength in Part with Meats and Wine restor'd, Refreshments from Messina sent Aboard, On Leopards spotted Skins in Libya drest Drousy they stretch'd their weary Limbs to Rest. His Angel swifter than the Morning Ray, So Alfred dreamt while slumb'ring sweet he lay, With radiant Wings shot down the yielding Skies Bliss and celestial Gladness in his Eyes, Godlike his Mien, ineffable his Grace, And rosy Youth possest his beaming Face: Approaching Alfred with divine Address, He gracious smil'd, and did these Words express. Alfred, that you fresh Courage may acquire, Improve your Vigour and heroick Fire, Whence you in adverse Fate may firm abide New Toils and Tryals which your Foes provide, The Pow'r supream, whose Breast is still inclin'd To guard the Righteous to his Will resign'd, Has me his Angel from his Throne of Light Sent to display before your wond'ring Sight The peaceful Seats of endless Joy and Bliss, And the low Regions of the dark Abyss; Whence you will learn your Zeal is well employ'd To gain the first, the latter to avoid. He saidâAnd then the Angel gently caught The Briton up, and, so the Heroe thought, On his immortal Pinions Alfred bore, And with his Charge did high in Ether soar. The Eagle never mounts so swift and strong, That with a Leveret truss'd to feed her Young, To her safe Nest in some wild Mountain's Height Or Rock entrusted, wings her airy Flight. They pass'd the Globes immense, that run their Course By Aid divine and delegated Force, And thro' th' expanded Districts of the Skies, And o'er blue Hills and Fields of Chrystal rise Till they had gain'd the bless'd Abodes above, The Regions of Delight and Seats of Love: Where Alfred ravish'd saw dispers'd around The happy Saints, with all their Wishes crown'd; Transports of Pleasure fill'd each swelling Breast, Which heav'd and labour'd with th' unequal Guest. Rich Splendor, that from Bliss internal came, Strove thro' their fair and undecaying Frame; These bright Eruptions from within convey'd A Heav'n of Glory round each Saint display'd. Then said the AngelâThese bless'd Men regard, What Joys what Triumphs now their Toil reward! What Words expressive can their Beauty tell! On every Face what Charms, what Graces dwell! What lovely Looks with Dignity combin'd! What blooming Cheeks with Strength immortal join'd! How great their Port! How graceful do they move! How pleas'd they seem! How full of Joy and Love! How rich their Robes, how ravishing to Sight, Form'd of pure Skies and interwoven Light! See, as along th' Etherial Fields they go, Behind what sweeping Trains of Splendour flow! What Raptures of Delight fill every Breast With Life divine and Youth unfading blest! What Palms triumphant do the Victors bear; Majestick Pomp! What radiant Crowns they wear! How blissful are their Eyes! How Godlike is their Air! The Guide continu'dâThis bright Quire behold, See in their Hands melodious Harps of Gold: What Hymns, what Praises they for ever sing, What Hallelujahs to th' eternal King! How their extatick Strains in Consort rise, And fill with loud Devotion distant Skies! See, of their Glory they their Heads uncrown, And at th' Almighty's Feet fall prostrate down, Where they entranc'd in Adoration lye O'erwhelm'd with Bliss ineffable, and cry To him, who sits on high enthron'd in Light, Salvation, Honour, Pow'r, Dominion, Might, Thanksgiving, Blessing be for ever giv'n, And to the Lamb that dy'd, and purchas'd Heav'n For his Elect, while he propitious paid Their Ransom, and for Guilt Atonement made. With the Fruition of th' Almighty blest, Transports of Pleasure not to be exprest, And ardent Passions swell each striving Breast: And while his beatifick Favours move The strongest Efforts of exalted Love, Inflame their Soul, and rapt'rous Wonder raise, They drink in endless Joy, and send forth endless Praise. There the bright Army of the Martyrs see That clad in Arms divine, Hope, Charity, Belief, and Patience, fought a glorious Fight, Subdu'd the World and put Hell's Prince to Flight; In what Abodes of Glory now they dwell, Celestial Scenes of Joy ineffable! These Worthies now unpersecuted rest, Who once endur'd Affliction's fiery Test: Pagans by killing some their Fury cloy'd, Some by worse Christian Tyrants were destroy'd; Some were by Racks and cruel Scourges try'd, And some by ling'ring manag'd Torment dy'd. These 'midst consuming Flames confess'd their Lord, Those by the Cross, these perish'd by the Sword. Hark! from beneath the Altar Night and Day These Souls devoutly thus th' Almighty pray, How long, how long, Lord righteous, faithful, good, Will it yet be ere Thou avenge our Blood? Ere thou indignant in thy Wrath resolve Our Murd'rers in Destruction to involve, Perform thy Word, make Justice spotless shine, And vindicate thy Government divine? The next to These in Dignity regard That order There; what Joys their Deeds reward! View their high Thrones, behold their Diadems Form'd of blest Gold and bright Etherial Gems, A Weight of Glory inexpressible, Their sparkling Eyes their inward Rapture tell. These are good Kings, in whose auspicious Reign None did of Wrong by Fraud or Force complain; They strove the People's Riches to encrease; And wag'd no War for Triumph but for Peace; They ne'er believ'd Religion Courts disgrac'd, Nor that to act like God a Prince debas'd: But frown'd on Vice, asserted Virtue's Cause, And by their own enforc'd celestial Laws. These knew that Crowns no Pow'r peculiar bring From Christian Precepts to exempt a King, Who levell'd with the Croud promiscuous stands At Heav'ns high Bar when Heav'n Account demands, His Dignity no more rever'd, for here Distinctions all but moral disappear. To the next Order, Alfred, turn your Sight, Clad in long Vests of beatifick Light, How fresh a Bloom their Cheeks immortal dies! What Extasies of Joy possess their Eyes! What circling Radiance darts from every Head, And from their Bow'rs what blissful Odours spread! These Christian Chiefs o'er Churches did preside, And with Applause their sacred Province guide; Who by their Lives, as well as Precepts, taught Rules that just Deeds and pure Belief promote; With ardent Zeal to serve their Lord inspir'd They fed the Flock and not the Fleece desir'd; They strove the Heart by Reason to incline, By gracious Speech and Evidence divine, And us'd no Arms Church-Conquests to acquire, But Faith's bright Sword, and Love's celestial Fire; Now their rich Crowns and happy Seats regard, What endless Raptures transient Pain reward! See there on high august Tribunals plac'd Judges with milk-white Robes of Honour grac'd; These, what impartial Justice bade, decreed, Condemn'd the Guilty and the Guiltless freed; With Minds unbiass'd and with Hands unstain'd, Fearless of Threats, they ancient Law maintain'd; Guarded the Orphan, screen'd the Widow's Right, And sav'd the Friendless from oppressive Might. And now that small but glorious Band behold Of faithful Statesmen, who their Monarch told Truth undisguis'd, and, to their Province just, Discharg'd with high Applause their weighty Trust. These unasham'd own'd and ador'd a God, In the bright Steps of Christian Heroes trod, Contemn'd the impious with a worthy Pride, And scorn'd the Scoffers who the Just deride: They open Truth and artless Virtue prais'd, And ne'er the sweet-tongu'd worthless Flatt'rer rais'd; Never deceiv'd, nor play'd a double Part, But, when they vow'd, express'd sincere their Heart; Firm to their Word their inward Notions spoke, And promis'd wary, but no Promise broke. See the brave Patriots there in blissful Bow'rs; These from a publick Spirit Sov'reign Pow'rs, And Law and Right with equal Zeal upheld, And from their Breasts all private Aims expell'd. Remark that Order, who illustrious shine In Linnen wrought above, and Vests divine, What mild Complacence, what a lovely Grace, And heav'nly Sweetness, dwell in every Face! These by celestial Goodness were inclin'd And ardent Love to succour humane Kind; In threat'ning Danger eas'd their Neighbour's Fears, And from the Mourner's Face wip'd off the Tears: They to their Home the weary Trav'ller led, And cloath'd the Naked, and the Hungry fed; Charm'd wild Despair, to Anguish gave Relief, And with soft Accents sooth'd reluctant Grief: Pour'd kindly healing Balm on wounded Veins, Ransom'd the Captive from his servile Chains, And oft were mov'd by Pity to bestow Various Supplies on various Sons of Woe; But most to Men their Charity apply'd In Aims divine and pious Faith ally'd; They Persecution's Frowns could dauntless face, And boldly side with Virtue in Disgrace. Now, while the Just review the dreadful Roads That led the Trav'llers to these bless'd Abodes, Dangers that once caus'd Terrour and affright, And Suff'rings past, grow Objects of Delight. So when a Swain, who seeks Hesperia's Soil, Shudd'ring with Fear, and faint with Sweat and Toil, Thro' craggy Rocks, steep Heights, and Snows, at last Secure the tow'ring Alpine Hills has past; He stands, looks back and views the Wildnerness, Then triumphs and enjoys his late Distress. And now the Seraph cry'dâHow great, how strange Above Expression is this happy Change! What a serene, what a bright Mansion this! What Scenes are these of Peace and endless Bliss! What is an earthly Monarch's transient Crown, His empty Grandour and inept Renown, The Victor's Trophies in long Triumph born, Or envy'd Laurels that his Brows adorn! What all the Pomp of Courts and Purple Pride By Heav'ns imperial State so much outvy'd! How short do narrow-sighted Mortals guess At the Delights the Saints in Heav'n possess! What faint unequal Images they draw Of these sweet Regions that they never saw! They represent the Pleasures of the Blest By Ease from Torment, and from Labour Rest: By Robes of Glory which bright Trains display, And Light out-shining far meridian Day; By Diadems, or by the Conquerour's Prize, And Shouts that raise the Heroe to the Skies; By Palaces sublime, by pompous Feasts, Where gen'rous Wine and Songs regale the Guests; By flow'ry Gardens ravishing to Sight, Fountains of Joy and Rivers of Delight: But all these weak Idea's, tho' the best By which celestial Triumphs are exprest, By measureless Degrees must fall below Th' immortal Bliss that Heav'ns Possessours know. Far as the Soul in noble Pow'rs excells The Tenement of Clay, in which it dwells, The Joys of Heav'n the Sweets of Sense exceed, Fear no Decay, and no Accession need. When Alfred thus had view'd with ravish'd Eyes These bright Etherial Seats, these happy Skies, Which on his Soul divine Impressions made, And high Idea's to his Thought convey'd, They by Degrees descended thro' the Air To the sad Realms of Horrour and Despair; The Walks of Death, and gloomy Gulphs of Hell, Where howling Pain and perfect Sorrow dwell. Then thus the Angel spokeâThe Wretched see, Condemn'd by Heav'ns unchangeable Decree To freeze by cold, or burn in raging Fire, To strive with dying Pangs, but ne'er expire; These once elated with enormous Pride The threat'ning Storms of penal Wrath defy'd, And bold rebell'd against th' Almighty's Throne, Nor would Religion's sacred Empire own: Scornful they mock'd, as unreflecting Fools, The strict Observers of the Christian Rules: These impious Beings thoughtless and supine, Immers'd in Vice and void of Taste divine, Preferr'd to heav'nly Bliss terrestrial Toys, And transient Pleasures to unceasing Joys. With fruitless Cries their Frenzy they lament, And of their fatal Choice too late repent; In Groans and mournful Wailings waste their Breath, And agonize in endless Throws of Death: Th' Almighty's Arms of pointed Light'ning made Strike thro' their Bosoms and their Hearts invade; Amidst the Depths of Woe the Wretches sink, Repeated Draughts of Wrath immortal drink, And with the eldest Phiol, that contains The strongest Vengeance, drench their swelling Veins. See, while in Hell they cast their envious Eyes Thro' intervening Gulphs to upper Skies, And view the Triumphs of the Righteous blest With heav'nly Joys and everlasting Rest, They rave, and cry, what Bliss did we refuse! For false Delight what real Pleasure lose! While those we mock'd have Seats celestial gain'd, We lye in Torture and in Darkness chain'd; Ruin'd, undone, and groaning in Despair Bewail the Fate we must for ever bear, And curse in vain th' Almighty's vengeful Darts That pierce our Breasts and fester in our Hearts. And now survey, said the seraphick Guide, Tophet accurs'd, that stretches far and wide Its gloomy Districts, view the burning Vale Whence Clouds of Smoke and sulph'rous Steams exhale, And where thro' num'rous gaping Chasms aspire Noisome Eruptions and red Flakes of Fire; While Storms beneath of striving Vapours rage, And subterranean War imprison'd wage, Rivers of Brimstone and infernal Oar Advance above and in their Channels roar: See, Hurricanes sweep o'er the level Land, And lift in Heaps the fluctuating Sand; To rise or fall the restless Fields constrain, And This and That Way drive the rolling Plain. Thro' all the troubled Gulph fierce Demons ride In rapid Whirlwind, and the Tempest guide; While dreadful Screams and lamentable Cries, That from th' Abodes of Death incessant rise, Amazing Thunder, Light'nings, fiery Show'rs, Like those that fell on impious Sodom's Tow'rs, Uproar, and Strife, and Yellings of Despair, A hideous Medly, fill th' infernal Air. His Guide then bore the Heroe to a Hill, Whence issuing Groans and Shrieks the Region fill; Then waving in the Air his glitt'ring Wand Of Adamant Etherial in his Hand, Dispell'd the gloomy Shade that on the Cells And burning Caves impenetrable dwells, Thro' the dark Vaults was spread a sudden Day, Whose shining Beams to Alfred's Eyes display The chief Abodes of Pain, that Rebels bear In the low Realms of Guilt and sad Despair. Then said the GuideâHow does this Mountain's Smoak With dismal Flames inwrapt the Region choak! See, in its Sides and round its Base below What ruddy Caves, what wide Volcano's glow! What Furnaces, that far in Heat surpass Those where the sooty Artist melts his Glass, Or those which raging in Sicilia's Isle Pollute the Skies, and shake the cavern'd Soil! To these dire Vaults, where dwell the Fires intense That eat in deep and most afflict the Sense, The sharpest Torments in the Courts of Death, Blown up by Tempests of Almighty Breath And fed with strongest Lees of Wrath divine, Heav'n's just Decrees tyrannick Pow'rs consign, Who scorning Right the World with Rapine fill'd, Releas'd at Pleasure and at Pleasure kill'd; Urg'd by infernal Rage their Arms employ'd, And Realms with wanton Cruelty destroy'd; While their own Cities they of People drain'd, Till like the Forrest Lords with Blood distain'd They riotted in Spoil and o'er a Desart reign'd. There groan the Giants that before the Flood, Abhorr'd for Rapine Violence and Blood, Affronted Heav'n, and us'd unbridled Might To tread down sacred Laws, and ravish Right: Such was their crying Guilt to Heav'n convey'd, That God repented he Mankind had made: Whence in his sore Displeasure he consum'd The godless Race to Death eternal doom'd. There rave obdurate Pharaoh and his Host Of mighty Warriours, in the Ocean lost While striving from the Billows to retire; O'erwhelm'd with Water then, and now with Fire. See, There th' Assyrian high imperial Lords, Princes, and Captains, whose resistless Swords Red'ning with Slaughter and with Triumph crown'd Destroy'd Mankind and aw'd the World around. They from the Field of Battle with the Slain Came down, and in th' infernal Depths remain: Their num'rous Guards and Multitudes immense, Whom once they kept for Glory and Defence, Around their Kings accurs'd tormented lye, While to their Shrieks the echoing Hills reply. Behold the Medes and Persian Potentates Who rul'd with Pride elated Asia's States, And by unrighteous War, intent on Fame, Extended wide and far their dreaded Name: Weak and disarm'd these like the Vulgar Dead, (No Scepters grace their Hands, nor Crowns their Head, For no Distinction in these Seats remains, But that of greater Guilt and fiercer Pains,) Descended to this execrable Place, The Prison of the old gygantick Race: The cruel Servants of their lawless Will The Caves around the great Oppressours fill. See next the Grecian Tyrants who destroy'd The Eastern Nations and their Spoils enjoy'd: Illustrious Robbers rich by Rapine grown, And potent by Possessions not their own, Once of their vast extended Empire proud, Came hither mingled with the common Croud. There burn the Chiefs that Rome's bright Scepter bore, Imperial Crowns and awful Purple wore, Enslav'd the trembling World, Mankind distress'd, And unprotected Nations sore oppress'd; They, with the Spoils of ruin'd Kingdoms fed Pamper'd with Riot and with Slaughter red, Came with the Slain down to these Caves profound, Not known from vulgar Shades; and all around Their Armies lye, their Chiefs and Men of Might, Who ravag'd Realms and took in Blood Delight. To this dire Valley of Gehenna, this Wild Region of Despair, this dark Abyss, Oppressive Lords of future Times, and all Who with their Iron Yoke their People gaul, And while they Wars unwarrantable wage, Leave bloody Marks of Cruelty and Rage, Shall cast down headlong from their Thrones repair, And in this Gulph superiour Torment bear. Next see th' Apostate Princes, who inur'd To right Belief at length their Creed abjur'd, And, urg'd by Lust of Empire and Applause, Renounc'd their Saviour and betray'd his Cause. In the same Mount, Lords their sad Lodging take Who kill'd their Subjects for Opinion's Sake: These thought the Scepter should free Reason sway, And that Belief should Fire and Sword obey, And trusting not Religion's native Charms, Planted their Faith in Blood &amp; spread its Pow'r by Arms: These did the Lands with fierce Instructors fill, And forc'd Men to believe against their Will: To honour God his Image they effac't, Terrestrial Realms, to people Heav'n, laid waste, And lest their Way erroneous Minds should miss, Bade cruel Russians guide them safe to Bliss. In the next Cells, that burn as fierce, behold Perfidious Statesmen, who in Treason bold, By deep Revenge or Lust of Riches sway'd, Their Prince, their Country, and their Trust betray'd. As not a Soul, that chain'd in Darkness raves And yells tormented in these burning Caves, Owns blacker Guilt, or Crimes that more disgrace Mankind than this accurs'd ungodly Race; So none are doom'd to more unweildy Chains, To stronger Vengeance or more raging Pains. There lye corrupted Judges, who for Gold Subverted Right and bought Decrees enroll'd, Or urg'd with Party-Malice wrested Laws, And shameless judg'd the Person, not the Cause. Now say, immortal SeraphâAlfred cries, What is yon Mountwhose Peaks exalted rise Amidst the Meteors of th' infernal Skies? They seem encas'd in Chrystal, and aspire Hoary with Frosts in raging Gulphs of Fire. The gracious Angel answer'dâBriton, know This is a diff'rent Seat of Pain and Woe. Pris'ners by cruel Spirits, who inspir'd Their wicked Breasts and with Ambition fir'd And Thirst of Gain their impious Souls, by Turns From the high Hill that unextinguish'd burns To this are carry'd, which exalted stands O'erlooking all the waste infernal Lands, Where cold extream and endless Winter reigns, And undissolv'd perpetual Ice remains: No polar Wind so keen and piercing blows O'er Hyperborean Coasts or Russia's Snows, As Blasts that in these stormy Caves are bred, And spend their Rage on this bleak Mountain's Head. Th' accurs'd immur'd in Chrystal freezing lye, Feel shiv'ring Pangs of Death, but never die: Millions of Atomes, all fine pointed Darts, Pierce thro' their Veins and penetrate their Hearts: They weep and gnash their chatt'ring Teeth, and fill With Groans and loud Despair the echoing Hill, While they by Turns from Death to Death retreat, Now burn by Cold intense, and now by Heat. When scorch'd in Flame, they frozen Seats desire; When there, again they ask their Vaults of Fire; Sad Choice! in either Suff'ring they complain, The Change enrages, not abates their Pain. That spreading Lake, now said the Angel, view, With dismal Flakes of kindled Sulphur blue; Regard the fluid scalding Stores, behold The livid Billows this and that way roll'd. Tempests of Vengeance o'er the Surges sweep, Blow up the Flames and agitate the Deep; Which tho' it ever burns is unconsum'd, As are the Rebels to its Torment doom'd: Pillars of furious Exhalations rise, And fill with Fire and Smoke the sultry Skies. See there great miter'd Chiefs of impious Mind And blameful Life to liquid Plagues consign'd. These as to teach, a Right to ruin claim'd, And at terrestrial Pomp and Riches aim'd; I'll pleas'd with Jesus, like the Jews before Who hop'd he came their Kingdom to restore, For promising no more than endless Bliss In the next World, no Pow'r or Wealth in this, Scornful of his, did their own Scheme pursue, Nor had they distant Heav'n, but Earth in view; These made beneath their Yoke the People groan, And Realms submissive their Dominion own; And while they held o'er Conscience awful Sway, Made scepter'd Princes crosier'd Lords obey: Still with delicious Wines and Banquets chear'd, The Flock they should have fed, they only shear'd, Sad Disappointment! how amazing strange Is this new State, this unexpected Change! Snatch'd from their painted Rooms and Beds of Ease They lye extended now on boiling Seas; Instead of Liquors, which their Thirst requires, They drink full Draughts of Wrath, &amp; swallow liquid Fires. The hateful Race that Providence deny'd, And from the Scoffer's impious Chair defy'd Almighty Pow'r, despis'd celestial Grace, And mock'd the Terrours of this dismal Place, To this hot Lake their sad Conviction owe, And disciplin'd in Hell Believers grow. Now in these Waves to flow and now retire, And rowl involv'd in undulating Fire, The Fools are sentenc'd who on Earth employ'd Their transient Hours in soft Delights, enjoy'd Riot immense, and in Succession pleas'd Each craving Sense, and every Lust appeas'd. Bewitching Pleasure's sweet but faithless Tide, Where they embark'd and did enchanted ride 'Midst all the Joys that Minds degen'rate charm And oft the Wisest of their Strength disarm, Smiling the thoughtless Voyager betrays, And all the soft luxurious Crew conveys To this dire Gulph, where her perfidious Stream Is empty'd; now their short delusive Dream Broke off, amaz'd and undeceiv'd they wake, And feel the Tortures of the burning Lake. Know, here th' Adult'rer must for ever groan, Plung'd in fierce Flames first kindled by his own: He now reflects amidst distracting Pains On past Pollutions and his guilty Stains With Shame and Horrour, and vain Curses spends On the sweet Poison which in Torment ends. The Hypocrite, who blameless Men caress'd, And more than vulgar Piety express'd, Yet Virtue in his secret Breast despis'd, And in a Saint-like Figure liv'd disguis'd, By artificial Looks and Goodness feign'd Conceal'd his Fraud, and great Possessions gain'd, Lays by his useless Mask and double Art, Condemn'd to act the Suff'rers open Part: He now involv'd in burning Waves remains O'erwhelm'd with Wrath unfeign'd, and real Pains. Here, They that threaten'd Torments did defy, Imagin'd deep Deceit, and hugg'd a Lye, Call for a Drop of Water to asswage Their burning Tongue's unsufferable Rage. There the Prophane, who Pow'r divine contemn'd, With Imprecations horrible blasphem'd Th' Almighty's Throne, and call'd him to attest Their false or idle Speech, are now opprest With Wrath immense, and all the Vengeance bear They once invok'd by execrable Pray'r. While Britain's Prince Gehenna's Vaults survey'd, He saw a black impenetrable Shade, Of Foggs infernal and dark Vapours made That on the Frontier near the Verge of Day Pond'rous and gloomy and unactive lay: Then earnest ask'd the Guardian Seraph why Those Clouds opacous there collected lye. Who thus reply'dâTo Alfred I reveal What those exalted Mounds of Shade conceal. Then with a Gleam of swift projected Light He pierc'd the Meteors and dispell'd the Night: The parting Mists on either Side withdrew, And the thick Darkness from its Station flew. Then saidâBehold the horrid Entrance there Of this Abyss, these Regions of Despair, The Port of Death, and the black Mouth of Hell, Where, as you see, tormented Rebels dwell. Observe, the Angel said, the Fiends that wait In threat'ning Crouds to guard the gloomy Gate With Fire-brands arm'd, that none may e'er retreat By Pow'r or Stealth from this infernal Seat; While from the Heights of Earth and Realms of Day Others the Dead to this sad Gulph convey: These, as the impious Criminals arrive, Receive them stern, and the chain'd Pris'ners drive With livid Flames and Whips of ruddy Wire To Vaults of dry, or Floods of liquid Fire; Where, since their Crimes are of a various Dye, In various Torments they despairing lye. Then said the Briton, Gracious Seraph, tell What is the Croud now rushing into Hell, The Gates unbarr'd and yawning horrible; And who's the Man that walks with sullen Grace, Majestick Port and melancholy Pace, Fierce Rage and vast Disturbance in his Face. The Briton ceas'dâThe mild celestial Guide To the enquiring Heroe thus reply'd. The Swarms you see, who in this destin'd Hour Thro' the wide Gates to Hell's sad Prisons pour, By their wild Aspects and vindictive Air Their ghastly Wounds and bloody Marks declare, Some martial Rout, and that the num'rous Train Come from the Field of Battle newly slain. The Chief that leads them (Solga is his Name, One lately proud of Empire, Wealth, and Fame, Lord of the various Realms on either Side, Where Ganges rolls his celebrated Tide,) To me is known; for by Supream Command I long presided Chief o'er India's Land: He vex'd the States around with proud Alarms, And ruin'd Kingdoms by his lawless Arms; Impious his Vows and solemn Treaties broke, Impos'd on peaceful Realms his heavy Yoke; And to extend his Conquests wide and far Destroy'd the Nations by ambitious War: Scarce one in Hell's intensest Fires exceeds In Falsehood, Pride, Revenge, and cruel Deeds, This godless King, none more the World defac't, Nor spilt more Blood, nor laid more Cities waste. See, while the Fiends to raging Flames convey Solga, what Numbers meet him on the Way: These were his Captains, Chiefs, and Potentates, That rul'd the Monarch's tributary States: They thus bespeak the King, their Voice I hear, Perceiv'd by mine, tho' not by Alfred's Ear. Art Thou, so lately rang'd among the Gods, At last arriv'd at these accurs'd Abodes? Thou, who with Triumphs and wide Empire crown'd Didst awe with mighty Hosts the World around, Art thou descended to these Seats abhorr'd, By all the Eastern World so late ador'd, This Place of Torment, where distracting Pain Rage and Despair in endless Triumph reign? Where are thy Purple Robes, thy dazling Crown, Imperial Ensigns, and august Renown? Art thou of all thy Pomp and Pow'r bereft? Like us, unpity'd, poor, and naked left? Could none of all thy Ministers design A Scheme to save their Prince from Wrath divine? Are all thy false and sweet-tongu'd Flatt'rers gone, That us'd to croud and bow before thy Throne? Where are thy num'rous Guards and mighty Host, That made the Nations tremble? are they lost? Vain Guards and Hosts, that could not Solga save From pow'rful Fate and this infernal Cave! Sink, cruel Tyrant, in th' Abyss of Hell Where fiercest Plagues and Pains immortal dwell. Go take Possession of these dismal Seats, Where Death unceasing Agonies repeats. Curst be the Hour we first thy Will obey'd, Curst be thy Court that has our Lives betray'd, Where first we learn'd to mock eternal Might, To plunge in Vice, and take in Blood Delight: Go to thy burning Cell; 'tis some Relief, Sad Consolation! to behold thy Grief. To meet him, see, a Band of Women flies, How menacing their Looks! how fierce their Cries! What Indignation rages in their Eyes! The foremost of the Train bespeaks him thus; Tyrant, art thou become like one of us? Art thou condemn'd to suffer gloomy Chains, And howl and groan in everlasting Pains? Must thou, like us, almighty Fury bear, And sink amidst the Depths of black Despair? Thou, Thou of my Destruction art the Cause, By Thee seduc'd I broke th' Eternal's Laws: To thee did I my Innocence resign, And perjur'd left my Consort's Bed for thine; Thy guilty Flames I yielded to appease, But, Tyrant, say, who shall extinguish these Which I endure in these dark Prisons barr'd, Of Criminal Delights the sad Reward? Perdition! Fury! Plagues! oh I could wrest And tear thy hateful Soul from out thy Breast. Lend me, Despair, thy sharp envenom'd Dart, That I may stab this Monster to the Heart. Know, Solga, Tyrant unexampled, know, I'll still enrage thy Pains and swell thy Woe; To pierce thy Breast and aggravate thy Hell I'll hourly haunt thee, in thy Ears I'll yell, And groan and scream and shriek about thy Cell: Besides, this Troop by thee betray'd will join Their Execrations and their Cries with mine. Solga provok'd his Teeth indignant gnash'd, And bit the ruddy Flame that round him flash'd: Furious he beat his Breast, and rais'd his Eyes In bitter Anguish to the sultry Skies. Now Demons whip him to his burning Cell, Where he for ever must in Torments dwell, Sharper than e'er were by the Lictor's Hand Inflicted at the Tyrant's fierce Command. Now while ascending from the Seats below, The Courts of Death and Residence of Woe, The gracious Seraph gently wing'd his Way Thro' gloomy Night to the bright Coasts of Day, He to the British Heroe thus addrest; Tenacious lodge th' Events within your Breast Which, Alfred, now shall by Prediction see Wrapt in the Womb of dark Futurity. After great Dangers, Cares, and various Toil, Alfred shall reach again his native Soil; Where he shall soon th' imperial Scepter sway, And willing Subjects shall his Laws obey: He'll quell the Dane, and with a potent Hand Sweep the devouring Locusts from the Land; Will Peace and Plenty to the Isle restore, And with his Navy guard Britannia's Shore. Now shall the Kingdom thus deliver'd smile, Pow'r shall defend and Plenty crown the Isle: Letters shall flourish; while with friendly Grace Soft Equity and rig'rous Law embrace: Freedom shall Might, and Justice Peace caress, And with united Charms the Nation bless. Enroll'd above, yet more great Saxons stand That shall the confluent Monarchies command. Thro' many peaceful Reigns fierce Cimbrian Swarms Shall cease to vex the Realm with Foreign Arms. (Yet on the Throne at length the Dane shall shine And interrupt a while the Saxon Line) Your potent Race shall by Degrees decay, And a new Line shall Albion's Scepter sway. The mighty Norman from Neustrasia's Shore On Albion's Strand shall valiant Cohorts pour, And land the floating War; he'll Harold beat, Then march in Triumph to th' imperial Seat Sublime Augusta, and the Throne ascend, From whose high Blood four Monarchs shall descend. And now a fam'd Plantagenet shall wear Th' imperial Crown, and make the Realm his Care, From this rich Stock shall flow a num'rous Train That shall, with various Fate, o'er Albion reign; Weak and inglorious now, now wise and great, They'll raise by Turns, by Turns depress the State. While this illustrious House shall rule the Isle Discord and Heats shall long the Land embroil, While rich and potent Patriots bold in Arms Shall trouble Albion's Peace by fierce Alarms, And jealous of their Freedom draw their Swords To check th' encroaching Pow'r of Sov'reign Lords. These long Disputes, whoe'er are Victors found, Will deeply fair Britannia's Bosom wound. Nor will she less beneath her Suff'rings groan From undetermin'd Titles to the Throne, While Chiefs for Empire strive with equal Might, Victorious now, and now subdu'd in Fight. Long the white Rose contending with the Red With Seas of Blood shall Albion overspread: Happy Espousals shall at Length unite The rival Pow'rs, and settle doubtful Right; Shall fix the wav'ring State, its Wounds cement, And the fierce Rage of civil Arms prevent. By Tudor now restor'd the British Line, Which Foreign Arms victorious Will confine To the high Hills beyond Sabrina's Tide, Shall mount the Throne and o'er the Realm preside. Now a new Race shall rise to rule the Isle, From Caledonia's independent Soil, Whose Kings united Scepters shall command, This of Britannia, that of Scotia's Land. Six Sov'reign Pow'rs shall from this Fountain flow, Who'll diff'rent Fate by diff'rent Conduct know. Nam'd by the States, and by th' august Nassau, Who shall the Land defend, proud Rebells awe, And great in Arms and wise in Council aim At Glory, and acquire immortal Fame, See, George on fair Britannia's Shore appears A second Saviour to dispell her Fears, Who midst triumphant Shouts of Joy unknown Shall reach Augusta and ascend the Throne. From the old Seats, whence Alfred's Fathers came, Kings of high Merit and Heroick Fame, Whose conqu'ring Swords acquir'd supream Command, Wore independent Crowns and shar'd the Land, This Monarch shall arrive on Albion's Strand. He shall the Kingdom rule by ancient Laws, Guard publick Right and aid Religion's Cause, Prone to forgive ev'n of his Foes the worst, To Friends indulgent and to all Men just. When with infernal Faction he contends Adhering firmly to his constant Friends, Of steady Mind and stable as a Rock 'Midst boist'rous Waves, he'll Party-Fury mock. Calm and unchang'd he'll in the Storm preside, Manage unruly Strife, the Tempest guide, And stem and drive Sedition's refluent Tide. Thus he'll the headstrong Multitude restrain Mad as the Winds, and restless as the Main. Happy Britannia! If thy Sons could know To this indulgent Monarch what they'll owe, Could they the Lust of too great Pow'r appease Patient of Wealth, and reconcil'd to Ease. The Prince, his Offspring, who shall bear his Name, Thirsty of Glory and Heroick Fame, Ev'n in the recent Bloom of Youth shall gain Laurels, the Warriour's Pride, on Belgia's Plain; Where he'll intrepid 'midst the Squadrons fight To guard invaded Realms from Gallick Might. Then in the Field for martial Deeds renown'd, Laden with Spoils and with Applauses crown'd, He'll with his Sov'reign pass to Albion's Isle, And share by Sea and Land his various Toil. His royal Consort of a noble Race, Whom all the Charms of finish'd Beauty grace, Happy in rich Endowments of the Mind, Dear to her Prince and to the People kind, Of gracious Mien and elegant Address, Not too reserv'd, nor of too free Access, Shall raise the Glory of Britannia's Court, Religion guard, and Liberty support. A Virgin she'll to Truth divine postpone The tempting Pow'r and Splendor of a Throne: Illustrious Fact! for which immortal Fame And Praise shall crown, bright Heroine, thy Name. See, from this royal Pair's blest Nuptial Bed, Fruitful of Princes to supply the Dead, A Train shall spring; some of this royal Seed Shall, as I trust in Heav'n it is decreed, Britannia's Scepter in long Order bear; And some shall Brides in foreign Kingdoms wear Imperial Crowns and sov'reign Honours share. In their first Offspring blended shall conspire The Mother's Sweetness and the Father's Fire, Whence inward Beauties with exteriour join, And in a lovely Constellation shine. This Prince for Empire turn'd and high Command, The other Hope of fair Britannia's Land, Shall Fred'rick be, a Genius just and bright, No less the People's than the Court's Delight. By Thee, O Alfred, may he form his Mind To Science, Arts, and Arms, like Thee, inclin'd, Then the illustrious Bloom the Youth displays Of princely Virtues, in maturer Days If such are granted, generous Fruits shall bear, And a full Head of ripen'd Glory wear. The Seraph ceas'dâAnd Alfred thus replies; In destin'd Time let that young Heroe rise, Who great in Arms Britannia may defend, Encrease her Virtue and her Pow'r extend; And may no hard disastrous Fate delay; In due Succession, that auspicious Day. Now did the gracious Guide the Briton bear From the low Regions to superiour Air, And plac'd him in the Grove, whence, so he thought, He was on high by the bright Seraph caught. Then Heav'ns illustrious Minister withdrew, And thro' the azure Districts mounting flew. Now was dissolv'd the visionary Scheme; And Alfred waken'd from th' important Dream, To Heav'n in pure Devotion rais'd his Thought, And Aid divine to guide his Steps besought. BOOK IX. The ARGUMENT. The Britons at the Return of Day leave the Wood, and advancing into the Country are seized as Spies by a Troop of the King of Agmat's Guards, who were in Search of Dalcanor, a great Offender fled from Justice. They are sent to Agmat, where the Inhabitants were then celebrating a high Festival in Honour of their God the Sun. They are carried before Albuzar the Governour, and examined, who, and whence they were. They own themselves to be Britons and Christians. The Governour tells them they must, according to an indispensable Law of the Country, pay solemn Worship to their Deity the Sun, or suffer Death. The Britons refuse the first. Are condemned, and led to Execution. On the Way thither, Guithun, who was an eminent Astronomer, foreknew that a total Eclipse of the Sun would happen at this Time, and, to terrify and dissuade the Agmatians from putting them to Death, he threatens them that their God should immediately be extinguished and blotted out of the Skies. The Eclipse ensued. The People seized with the utmost Consternation, entreat Guithun to restore their Deity. Guithun promises that he should be re-established; which done, the People taking the Britons for Gods descended from Heaven in Humane Shape, were ready to pay divine Honours, and offer Sacrifices to them, which Guithun interposing prevents. The People kill Albuzar, and destroy his Palace. The Britons are carried to Abal the King, who receives them with great Kindness and Respect. The King of Dara hearing that Albuzar was slain, who, tho' an ill Man, had been a successful General, and had brought that Prince under the Agmatian Yoke, takes this Opportunity to rise in Arms and invade Abal's Kingdom; who hearing the News, immediately orders his Army should be assembled. Gives Alfred the chief Command. The Prince overthrows the Darans. Is received with great Applause at Agmat. Abal advanced in Age and grown weary of publick Cares, resigns his Crown and Dignity. The People chuse Alfred to fill his Place. Alfred refuses, and recommends to them Golan, who is unanimously elected King. Now did the solar Orb revolving rise With growing Glory thro' the Saffron Skies; Alfred and Guithun from the Wood advance To search th' unpractis'd Country, when by Chance A well arm'd Squadron by their Monarch sent Dalcanor's Embarkation to prevent, A Minister corrupt from Justice fled, In their Pursuit of this Offender's Head Observ'd the British Pair, who from the Shore Wander'd this unknown Region to explore. As Spies they seiz'd and led them to the Town Of Agmat first in Empire and Renown. The People then held to their God the Sun Their annual Feast, which, when he rose, begun. Worship divine th' adoring Vot'ries pay, And solemnize with pompous Rites the Day. The Domes with Clouds of balmy Incense smoke, While fatty Vapours from the Entrails broke Of Victims burning in each sacred Grove, And Fumes in curling Columns upward strove. Now were the Britons to Albuzar led, Th' imperial City's delegated Head, And the great King's first Officer of State; He bade them who and whence they were relate. Alfred reply'dâYou see of Albion's Isle Two Natives shipwreck'd cast on Libya's Soil. Then are you Christiansâsaid the Pagan Chief. The Prince return'dâTo that divine Belief We firm adhereâThen said Albuzar, know, You on this Feast must to the Temple go, And to our God the Sun due Honour show: An ancient sacred Law commands that all Found on this Day within our City's Wall Must to adore our Deity comply, And practise our religious Rites, or die. Then AlfredâHeav'n indulgent is and good, And takes Delight in Mercy, not in Blood: This Pow'r supreme, that sits enthron'd above A Mind benevolent, a God of Love, Can no religious Cruelty approve. Zealots to him detested Worship pay Who, to instruct the Mind, the Body slay. Schemes of Belief, that tend not to create Intestine Ferments and embroil the State, Should from coercive penal Laws be freed, Doctrines from Heav'n no earthly Terrours need. Can Creeds be fram'd by Lictors? to the Heart Can tort'ring Scourges, Racks, and Wheels, impart Passions devout and pure? can Light divine Emerge from Dungeons or the Delver's Mine? The greatest Monarchs can't extend, by Right, Beyond their Civil Sphere their civil Might. Hence none condemn'd should at your Altars bleed For Disagreement with the publick Creed: Oh! let not Strangers shipwreck'd on your Strand Perish in this inhospitable Land; Let not Agmatian Lords relentless grow, And, than the Storms we 'scap'd, less Mercy show. Your God, the Sun, to Good and Bad is kind, Nor is his Bounty to a Sect confin'd, But his revivng Heat and Lustre flow Without Distinction on the Realms below. Hence we your Favour can't in vain implore, If, of th' illustrious Orb that you adore, You Ã¦mulous on all impartial shine, And spread around Benevolence divine. He ceas'dâAlbuzar wrathful thus reply'd; Are then our God, our Laws, and Pow'r defy'd? Your Words are vain, without prolong'd Debate Kneel at our Altars, or expect your Fate. Then AlfredâIdol-Worship we refuse, Fix'd in our Faith, and Death shall rather chuse Than on his Wrath by Disobedience run Who reer'd the World, and made your God, the Sun, Which shines dependent on that Source of Light, And climbs the Skies by delegated Might. This GOD unseen, whose Hands alone sustain What first he made, the Heav'ns, and Earth, and Main, Gave to the solar Orb his motive Force, And settled Orders that direct his Course: This God we honour and his Will obey, But to his Creatures no Devotion pay. He ceas'dâAnd, when incens'd Albuzar saw The Christians in Contempt of Agmat's Law Resolv'd the publick Worship to defy, Refuse Obedience and accept to die, He gave to waiting Officers Command That both should suffer by the Headsman's Hand. Then cruel Lictors to a neighb'ring Plain, Where Criminals expir'd in tort'ring Pain, Convey the Britons, while a shouting Throng To see the bloody Action march along. Guithun, who, verst in Astronomick Art And own'd superiour to the greatest Part Of Sages, knew that at th' approaching Noon In Nature's Course the interceding Moon Would wholly interrupt the solar Ray, And with surprising Gloom efface the Day, Resolv'd in this important Hour to use His Astrologick PrÃ¦science to amuse Th' unletter'd Nation, and dispose their Mind Not to inflict the cruel Stroke design'd. Then, beck'ning with his Hand, he cry'd aloud, And earnest thus bespoke th' attentive Croud; To shed our Blood beware how you proceed, See, to deter you from this heinous Deed, Heav'n will o'erspread the Land with sudden Night, Blot out your Sun, and of his chearing Light Defraud your Tribes, when you with fruitless Cries And unprevaling Pray'r shall fill the Skies. See and repent, the awful Scene's begun, Lift up your Eyes, behold the sick'ning Sun Shines dimly, soon you'll find his splendid Train Extinguish'd, and will seek the Day in vain. Your God, prodigious Sight! At Noon will set, And mask his Visage with a Veil of Jet; While you astonish'd will bewilder'd stray, And in meridian Darkness lose your Way. Now did the intervening Moon apace Advancing in her heav'nly Road efface The Source of Light, and by Degrees at last His whole refulgent Body overcast; And while his Beams began to disappear, The People shook at once with Cold and Fear; For, introduc'd by dark unnat'ral Shades, A sudden Winter's Force the Air invades. Uncherish'd now by solar Light and Heat Their Hearts with Toil their vital Task repeat; While shiv'ring Chillness seizes every Vein, Slackens their Sinews and disturbs their Brain, Which deep Impressions left of various Kind, That pain the Body or afflict the Mind. Reveal'd by Darkness Stars amaz'd the Sight, And thro' surprizing Gloom diffuse surprizing Light: The radiant Leaders of the Ev'n and Morn, Beheld at once, the wond'ring Heav'ns adorn: Nor could the Birds deluded overcome Their sudden Fear and Consternation, some In various Errour this and that Way flew, Nor what Abodes to seek bewilder'd knew; While some to shady Coverts wing'd their Flight In their known Roosts to pass expected Night. Flocks in the dark from Shepherds went astray, Who the nocturnal Shade at middle Day Astonish'd view'd, mean Time the plowing Swains, The Ox unyoak'd, in Terrour left the Plains. The Lyon too, deceiv'd, his Time mistook, Rous'd, yawn'd, &amp; stretch'd, &amp; his close Den forsook, Then roaring thro' the Forrest made his Way, And, tho' so lately fed, pursu'd his Prey. The Pagan Nation, at this dismal Sight In Horrour and ineffable Affright, Fearing the Sun was blotted from the Skies, And would no more to bless their Kingdom rise, With howling Cries the British Sage implor'd That by his Aid their God might be restor'd. Guithun aloud reply'dâSoon you shall find The Sun rekindled will again be kind. And as he saidâThe Moon, some Moments past, Whose Shade the solar Orb had overcast, Advancing on her known progressive Task, From his bright Face in Part remov'd the Mask: Then, wond'rous to behold! a sudden Blaze Of heav'nly Glory and oppressive Rays, Unsufferable Burst of gushing Light, Sprung from the Heav'ns and pain'd the dazled Sight: Now by Degrees the Sun his Orb reveal'd, Which by Degrees the Moon before conceal'd. At this surprizing Scene the gather'd Croud In Songs and Dances, Acclamations loud And Shouts of Triumph, rapt'rous Joy express To see the Sun his Empire repossess. Then all exclaim'dâThese are not Men, but Gods Newly descended from their bless'd Abodes In humane Form disguis'd; then let us shew Honours divine to these high Beings due. And first the priestly Order richly dress'd Their Zeal to honour Albion's Sons express'd. Some brought sleek Bullocks for the Altar fed With flow'ry Garlands crown'd, some eager led In solemn Pomp devoted harmless Lambs, While others forward shov'd their bleating Dams, Which they as sacred Victims meant to slay And publick Worship to the Strangers pay. Inconstant Vulgar, who as Gods adore The Men condemn'd to Torments just before! Guithun, perceiving this, amidst the Croud Impetuous rush'd and thus exclaim'd aloud; Deluded Men, your rash Attempt forbear, Dismiss the Pomp, and undue Honours spare. We are not Beings of celestial Race, But you as Brother-Mortals we embrace. Believe me, we are Flesh and Blood like you, And eat and drink our Vigour to renew. Common to you we under Suff'rings groan, And in our Breasts feel Passions, like your own. He saidâYet scarcely could his Zeal prevent Unhallow'd Rites, and change the Priests Intent. The Multitude incens'd with Fury flew To his high Palace and Albuzar slew With all his hapless Offspring, then defac'd His curious Gardens, Walks, and Groves, and raz'd His proud aspiring Structure, to asswage At the fierce Ruler's Cost vindictive Rage, Who by his rash Decree condemn'd to die Two judg'd immortal Natives of the Sky: While others with unusual Honours bring The British Pair to Abal Agmat's King, And told him these Commands on Nature lay, That they recall'd the Sun's departed Ray, Succour'd their God, and re-establish'd Day. Th' indulgent Monarch clasp'd them to his Breast, And of a grateful Mind great Marks exprest. Abal, a Sov'reign generous, wise, sedate, Long rul'd in War and Peace the happy State; But when in Years advanc'd, to Ease inclin'd, He to Albuzar publick Cares resign'd, Who with despotick Will the Kingdom sway'd, While his Commands the Camp and Court obey'd: But ill the Fav'rite royal Goodness us'd, Betray'd his Trust and his high Pow'r abus'd, While he the Realm by cruel Ways distress'd, Plunder'd the Wealthy and the Poor oppress'd: Thus he excited universal Hate, And by enormous Guilt brought on his Fate. Th' indulgent King receiv'd in princely Sort The British Heroe at his splendid Court, Whose princely Virtues there to all appear So bright, so great, so from Suspicion clear, That soon he grew to Abal's Servants dear. One Night, while Sleep his downy Wings had spread O'er Alfred's Eyes then resting on his Bed, Bright Amel swift as Heav'n's exploded Flame Down the steep Vacant to the Briton came, And in a Vision to the Heroe said, Empow'r'd by high Commission I have sped My Way to Abal's Court, to let you know, That, by this Prince to quell a faithless Foe Who'll soon invade his Kingdom, when you 're pray'd With earnest Speech in Arms to give him Aid, You to the King should unreluctant yield, And lead his muster'd Warriours to the Field. This will become a great Heroick Mind, You'll hence without Remorse true Pleasure find, And by illustrious Deeds on Agmat's Plains Efface in Part your late Sicilian Stains. This said, he vanish'd; and without Delay Alfred resolv'd Heav'n's Orders to obey. Then the next Evening, while the royal Pair Travers'd the Walks to breathe refreshing Air, Two Officers of Rank superiour bring, Panting with Haste, bad Tidings to the King, That with a potent Army Dara's Lord The Kingdom had invaded, and with Sword And Fire the Country and the Towns laid waste; That he the Streights of Abela had past, And, if not soon oppos'd, might Orban gain, And thence advance direct to Agmat's Plain. Present of Mind the Monarch gave Command That his great Chiefs, the Daran to withstand, With utmost Speed their Forces should unite, And march th' Invader to engage in Fight. He then the Briton courteous thus bespoke; The Daran, whom no Reasons just provoke, Has solemn Vows and Leagues of Friendship broke. War not denounc'd the faithless Prince assail'd Our Towns ill-mann'd, and has so far prevail'd By unexpected ignominious Arms, That Agmat fears th' Aggressor's proud Alarms. My Chiefs, their Troops assembled, will attack Th' insulting Foe to drive the Tempest back; But, Alfred, you, importunate I ask, Will head the gather'd Army, 'tis a Task Worthy the British Heroe's generous Hand To quell proud Might, and guard an injur'd Land. Then lead my Host to glorious Labour, thus Renown will you attend, and Safety us. Alfred, whose Intercession could retrieve Th' extinguish'd Sun, may troubled States relieve With greater Ease; on you I firm rely, On you, to whom the Gods no Aid deny. Alfred, to pay Obedience fully bent To the Command by the bright Seraph sent, Comply'd, and took at Dawn of Light his Way To Goreb, where collected Bodies lay Of Abal's Forces, and was quickly join'd By neighb'ring Troops to swell the Host design'd. The Army thus encreas'd puissant grows, When Alfred march'd to meet th' advancing Foes, And with such Ardour, such heroick Airs, And Spirit undismay'd for Fight prepares, That all his Looks, and Mien, and Words, express Th' auspicious Tokens that presage Success. The Host observ'd him with consummate Joy, Sure that his Aid would the proud Hopes destroy Of Dara's Monarch, and support their State Against the Terrours of impending Fate. And now the Daran Army march'd in Sight, But Action was deferr'd by growing Night. In his Pavilion Alfred watchful lay, And search'd the Heav'ns with eager Eyes for Day. At length the Morning Ray began to try Its tender Wings, and thro' th' Abyss of Sky Flew smiling down; the British Heroe rose Pleas'd, his Brigades for Combate to dispose. Now clad in polish'd Armour, glorious Sight! That pain'd Spectators with reflected Light, He mounted swift his Mauritanian Steed, Fam'd for his Beauty, Courage, Strength and Speed, The most renown'd of Abal's noble Breed. With his strong Hand he grasp'd his trembling Lance, Look'd fearless round, and bade his Troops advance. His bounding Courser scornful of the Rein Carried the martial Tempest o'er the Plain With graceful Pride, the Rider with an Air And dauntless Aspect, such as Heroes wear And such as inbred Fire and Valour shew, Impatient of Delay to Battle flew. The Daran at his mighty Army's Head, Bold and with sanguine Hopes of Conquest fed, Advancing thro' the Pass of Cela press'd, And by Degrees his Van the Vale possess'd. Soon was his Host extended wide and far, And cover'd all the Fields with spreading War. So when a Cloud, at first but small, in Air Is seen near Western India's Climates, where The Ãquinoctial Girdle does embrace The Earth's round Globe, soon all th' Etherial Space Black congregated Vapours overspread, Whence adverse Storms and Hurricanes inbred Are ready to explode their hostile Rage, And in aerial Fight their Strength engage. Before the Briton would the Foe assault, Tho' near advanc'd, he bade his Squadrons halt; Then holding up on high a Parchment roll'd And turning to his Troops he cry'd, Behold The friendly League between the Monarchs sign'd And fix'd by sacred Oaths; no Wit can find Words of more Force, that can two Princes bind, Your Sov'reign from his Archieves gave in Trust To me this Volume, when his Orders first Alfred receiv'd, to which I now am just. With worthy Indignation then to fire Your Breasts and double Courage to inspire The Treaty hearâ. A Herald now aloud Read the Diploma to the martial Croud That list'ning stoodâThe Chief, that Office done, Thus to the Cohorts pour'd around begun. Warriours, you see the Darian King defies Justice divine, and mocks religious Tyes; 'Tis clear he impious Principles allows, Affronts his God and violates his Vows; This has the Pow'r that rules the World incens'd, Who ne'er with such enormous Guilt dispens'd: Perfidious Princes War not only wage With injur'd Realms on Earth, but Heav'n engage, Whose fatal Vengeance Monarchs will pursue Not to their Oaths nor solemn Promise true. Confed'rate Pow'rs from the bright Host above That Fraud abhor and your just Cause approve, Sent by the Lord of Armies high Command, Grasping immortal Sabres in their Hand, Hover in Air unseen to charge the Foe, And will their Hate of Treaty-breakers show. Trust to your Cause, and on their Guilt depend; The Realm their Arms invade, their Crimes defend: Undaunted meet them, and in Battle brave Assert your Monarch, and your Country save. Devoutly then the Heroe rais'd his Eyes, And, holding up the Treaty to the Skies, He saidâGreat Pow'r, who dost the Just protect, And perjur'd Nations in thy Wrath correct, To vindicate thy Laws, and States affright From breaking Leagues and violating Right, Punish this Day by some Agmatian Sword This proud Invader, Dara's faithless Lord. That saidâHe sprung, and with a gen'rous Thirst Of Glory plung'd amidst the Ranks, and first Noble Borello from fair Arva's Plains Felt the bright Javelin in his wounded Veins. Then mighty Dravan with enormous Rage Rush'd thro' the Field the Heroe to engage: The Briton heard him threat'ning from afar, And fir'd with Fury coveted the War: Then to th' advancing Chief intrepid flew, And by his matchless Arms the Champion slew. So a young Lyon, that in prosp'rous Fight His Courage oft has shown and prov'd his Might, If, now convinc'd of his superiour Force, He spies a vig'rous Bull that bellowing hoarse And proudly nodding thro' the flow'ry Meads His fair horn'd Troop with Pace majestick leads, Lashing his Sides he roars, he licks his Jaws, And oft to feel his Strength strikes out his Paws; Then rushing on with Terrour in his Eyes, Rapid to tear his Foe in Combate flies. Alfred his Weapon next at Boran threw, Which struck the valiant Chief, and, passing thro' His Bosom, enter'd deep his bleeding Heart That trembling felt low ebbing Life depart: The Warriour fell and in Convulsions lay Striving with earnest Eyes to catch the Day. His Fauchion next great Taracol assail'd, Whose Sword o'er mighty Heroe's had prevail'd; The Weapon sever'd from the Neck the Head, This gasping bounded, while that jetting bled At all the open'd Veins, and drench'd the Ground With reeking Streams of Purple pour'd around. When Atrofan a Chief of great Renown, By his high Birth of Kindred to the Crown, Seeing the Prince with such Success advance, Sprung forward to engage him with his Lance, Which with prodigious Strength and Fury hurl'd Had sent immediate to another World A vulgar Warriour, but in Alfred's Shield The Weapon stuck; he to assure the Field To his undauuted Foe with Vigour flew, And at a Blow cut Head and Head-piece through: He fell, and shook the Ground, a dreadful Cry Rung thro' the Daran Host and reach'd the Sky. Then thro' opposing Files the Briton broke, And on the right and left at every Stroke Kill'd or dismember'd Heroes, till the Slain With ghastly Heaps deform'd the reeking Plain. Della mean Time, who martial Honour sought, Brave but with unsuccessful Valour fought; For, by the Daran's thick Brigades opprest And compass'd round, the Leader in his Breast Receiv'd a mortal Thrust, the glitt'ring Spear, Its Point distain'd, did thro' the Back appear. Thus fell the wise and great Agmatian Chief, And thro' the Host mov'd universal Grief. The Troops by this intrepid Warriour led, Desponding when they saw their General dead, By greater Numbers press'd began to yield The Battle, and forsake th' unequal Field. Soon as Britannia's conquering Heroe found That Della's strong Battallions left their Ground, To stop their Flight he 'midst the Cohorts flew, And from his foaming Courser eager threw Himself upon his Feet, and cry'd aloud With moving Accents to the daunted Croud, Courage, brave Warriours, tho' your Leader's slain, Renew the Combate and your Ground regain: Your wonted Valour now intrepid show, And with your Arms chastize a perjur'd Foe: You for your Country now in Arms appear, Your King, your Kindred, Friends, and all Things dear: Shall these fair Towns be lost? these fertile Plains? And servile will you wear th' Invader's Chains? Say, has th' extinguish'd Sun reviv'd his Light To see your Troops by ignominious Flight Decline the Combate, leave in Fear the Field, And to a faithless Prince your Nation yield? Forbid it Heav'n, then follow me to Fame, Renown and Safety be your double Aim. Then to the Charge the valiant Heroe sprung, And the first Weapon, which he furious flung, Slew Jared fighting at his Squadron's Head, In courtly Arts and military bred. Next he at Adull cast his pointed Spear; It pierc'd his Head and pass'd from Ear to Ear: His Vigour sinking by the dreadful Wound The Heroe fell, and as he struck the Ground His Arms and Armour clank'd, his Limbs grew cold, And Life forsook th' inhospitable Mould. Next his bright Javelin did at Salan fly, And enter'd deep the Warriour's brawny Thigh, Splinter'd th' opposing Bone, and with its Point Made its swift Passage thro' the yielding Joint: His Friends rush'd in, and on an ample Shield Bore off the wounded Heroe from the Field. Golan elsewhere, a brave Agmatian Lord, Amidst the Cohorts his destructive Sword Employ'd at vast Expence of hostile Blood: PhÃ¦da, who came from Gira's noble Flood, Oppos'd his Arms, but with unequal Force Strove to arrest the valiant Champion's Course; Who gath'ring up his Vigour cast his Dart With mighty Strength, and pierc'd the Daran's Heart. Bold Capi ne'er of threat'ning Death afraid With hasty Strides rush'd in to bring him Aid, But soon th' Agmatian Spear transfixt his Chest, The Heroe fell with endless Night opprest. Next with resistless Arms the Warriour kills Great Molpo from the high Atlantick Hills, Whose lofty Ridges far thro' Libya run And with unmelted Snows upbraid the feeble Sun. Then mighty Dupar from Garama's Plain, And valiant Orfat, by his Arms were slain, And many Warriours more, that bleeding lay Their Eyes defrauded of their vital Ray. Thus did the Chief unrivall'd Valour show, And, where he fought, broke thro' th' opposing Foe, And soon the Time will come, that shall reward His Arms, that now so well his Country guard. The Daran Chiefs with fresh Brigades attack Th' Agmatian Lord, and strive to drive him back. Now close in Fight the Foes each other prest, And Foot to Foot they strove and Breast to Breast, Whence on the Sand lay bleeding Heaps of Slain, And ghastly Ruin fill'd the Purple Plain. From mingled Cries by various Kinds of Death, From Groans of Warriours gasping out their Breath, From neighing Coursers, and the ringing Blows Of Swords on Helms and Shields, such Clamour rose, That all, who dwelt around, astonish'd stood, Pity'd Mankind, and mourn'd th' Expence of Blood. So when the raging Caves of Strombolo, Hot Ãtna, or sublime Vesuvius, throw On high their Minerals and unfinish'd Oars, In Earth's low Vaults imprison'd Thunder roars, And with such Noise the pond'rous Vomit flies, So shakes the Shores, and so embroils the Skies, That all the neighb'ring Towns the Uproar hear, And struggling Nature's Dissolution fear. Mean Time with Fury Dara's King engag'd Prince Alfred's Right, and thro' the Battle rag'd. Boma; for Arts and martial Deeds renown'd, First from his Spear receiv'd a fatal Wound; He sinking groan'd and gasp'd, and grovling lay, Till Death excluded from his Eyes the Day. Striving th' invading Monarch to repell Next noble Braga much lamented fell; The fatal Javelin pierc'd his bleeding Veins, Wounded his Bowels, and transfixt his Reins. Next his broad Fauchion's horizontal Blow Struck off brave Narva's Head, a gen'rous Foe, Who, tho' a Patriot, was the Court's Delight; His Trunk dismember'd quiv'ring lay to Sight Ghastly, while all his sever'd Art'ries bled, Bath'd the dry Sand, and warm'd the neighb'ring Dead. Then Sorba, Boscan, Kindred to the Crown, Burkell and Mofa Chiefs of high Renown, And mighty Darkan from fair Guada's Plain, Fell by the Monarch's Arms in Battle slain. And while he made this terrible Effort, Th' Agmatians long the bloody War support, Till born by Numbers down, and forc'd to yield; Their broken Cohorts left th' unequal Field. The Daran Squadrons Sword in Hand pursue, Hung on their Rear, and num'rous Warriours slew: Then sure of Conquest and with Plunder pleas'd They on the Camp and wealthy Baggage seiz'd. While thus the Foe in gath'ring Spoils employ'd A half-won Vict'ry's unripe Fruits enjoy'd, Alfred, that held his stagg'ring Foot from Flight Inspir'd fresh Courage and renew'd the Fight, Return'd the Daran Horse again invades, And made vast Havock 'midst their thick Brigades; He broke th' opposing Files, and Victor spread The Ground with wounded Chiefs and Heaps of Dead. As when a Torrent from the melting Snows Of Libya's lofty Mountains rapid flows Down the rude Tracts to feed the craving Nile, Fill his dry Caves, and chear burnt Egypt's Soil, It bears down Rocks and Forrests in its Course, And gains the Valley with resistless Force. The Briton so the Daran's Troops o'erthrew, That felt his dreadful Sword or from it flew. While now no Leader of superiour Fame, And bold in Fight, to charge the Briton came, A While his fatal Weapons he suspends, Nor glitt'ring Deaths by Spear or Javelin sends On Messages inglorious, while from far The clam'rous Bands maintain'd unhurtful War. As when a Yelper of the mongrel Race Flies out, and barking fierce presumes to face A fearless Mastiff of the gen'rous Kind, Which Men in Albion or Thessalia find, He unconcern'd does Looks disdainful throw, And careless thro' the Streets advances slow, Scorns the base Strife, and asks a nobler Foe. So did the Heroe vulgar Combate slight And spar'd his Arms, when now appear'd in Sight A Chief of dreaded Name, Darvenna's Lord, A Rival worthy of the Briton's Sword: Soon as the Daran saw Prince Alfred near, With mighty Strength he hurl'd his glitt'ring Spear, And had not Alfred's Shield the Weapon staid, Its Point had thro' his Breast its Passage made. The Briton then projected his, aside It flew, and Rocar by its Errour dy'd. Their hissing Deaths a while alternate past, As yet with untriumphant Labour cast, While every Javelin and projected Lance Stay in their Shields, or thence recoiling glance: Then Alfred griev'd, that Victory so long Hov'ring in Air with balanc'd Pinions hung, Eager of Conquest gather'd up his Might, And straining all his Nerves to end the Fight, His pond'rous Spear against the Daran threw, Which thro' his polish'd Shield impetuous flew, And thro' the Cuirass wounded deep his Side, Whence streaming Blood his splendid Armour dy'd. Their Weapons wasted, which they threw from far, The Combatants advance to closer War. The Daran Chief hot to revenge his Wound, With stern Defiance travers'd first the Ground, Then wav'd his pond'rous Fauchion o'er his Head, And in proud Words pronounc'd the Briton dead. Alfred incens'd, his Breath and Strength restor'd, Assail'd his Rival with his flaming Sword, And, while, his Arm high rais'd, a mortal Blow The Combatant prepar'd to sink his Foe, The Briton thrust his Weapon's glitt'ring Point With Force resistless thro' his Armour's Joint; Between the Warriour's Ribs it furious went, And in his bleeding Heart its Vigour spent: He fell, and found his vital Spirits yield, Indignant gnash'd his Teeth, and bit the Field. Now, Numbers lost and their fam'd Champion slain, The Daran Troops unable to sustain Th' unequal Conflict in amazing Dread, Routed and ruin'd, from the Battle fled. Then Alfred drew his Squadrons in Array, And march'd to meet the Monarch on his Way Laden with Riches by his Arms procur'd, And of the Battle won too soon assur'd. Soon as the Daran saw the Foe advance, And found the Troops he left, by fatal Chance, Were vanquish'd, loud he curs'd his hapless Fate, Of his rash Errour now convinc'd too late. Soon did the Briton bright in Arms invade The Foe's Battalions at his Sight dismay'd, And of their Youth immense Destruction made. Broke by his Charge their disarray'd Remains O'erspread with scatter'd Spoils the Hills and Plains, Marks of their Army's ignominious Rout: The Victor suff'ring much by Toil and Drought Chac'd Dara's King, who hindmost left the Fight With Chiefs the sad Companions of his Flight, And all the Anguish, Spleen, and Rage confess'd, By proud discarded Ministers express'd; But in the Chace, inglorious Fate! by Chance The Monarch wounded by a random Launce Cast by a vulgar Hand expiring fell, And sunk, where Treaty-Breakers rave, to Hell. Alfred surrounded with an endless Croud, 'Midst Shouts of Triumph and Applauses loud, Returning enter'd Agmat's lofty Gate, Where the first Courtiers his Arrival wait; These to the King the Victor Heroe led; He clasp'd him in his Arms, and gracious said, Receive my Thanks, victorious Prince, and know As to your Sword th' Agmatians Safety owe, So your great Name in coming Ages here Shall be to all, as now to Abal, dear. And now the chearful Court their Hours employ In Marks expressive of uncommon Joy; While all, in Musick, Feasts, and various Plays, Exhaust the Nights, and dissipate the Days. The Youth in Sports and active Kinds of Game, Eager of Conquest to assure a Name, With Vigour strive; on Chariots mounted some Exert their Art and Strength to overcome Their Rivals, some on Steeds and some on Foot Swift Races run, and some at Rovers shoot. These with Address project the glitt'ring Lance, Those rein hot Steeds, that bound, curvett &amp; dance, Or with Applause in Carousels advance. With long protended Spears these tilting spring, Those run with manag'd Coursers at the Ring. The British Prince to honour Abal's Court In Tournaments and Games of manly Sort Was pleas'd his Strength and Skill to signalize, And much applauded gain'd th' unenvy'd Prize. Abal aspiring to heroick Fame Had, in preceeding Years, advanc'd his Name, Enlarg'd his Empire by successful Arms, And fill'd all Libya's Realms with loud Alarms. Vict'ry, with Lawrel-Honours in her Hand, Her shining Wings auspicious did expand And circling hover'd o'er the Monarch's Head, When he his Armies forth to Battle led; While vanquish'd Cities and submissive States Rever'd his Pow'r, and humble Potentates At the great Conqu'rour's Feet their Scepters laid, Brought costly Presents, and his Favour pray'd. On these he gracious smil'd, but with his Frowns Shook disobedient tributary Crowns. The num'rous Nations on the Western Shore, Where the Atlantick foaming Billows roar, From the Herculean Pillars to the Coast Where tow'ring Claro's Head in Clouds is lost, And from the inland Sea that laves the Strand Of Tingitana to the Sun-burnt Land, Where stretching West and East in azure Skies The snowy Peaks of lofty Atlas rise; The swarthy Tribes, that on Bardulio's Brink Their Dwellings rear, or swift Bagrada Drink, And all, that till the Glebe with gainful Toil, From Fessa's Tow'rs to Targa's fruitless Soil, To Abal's Yoke their Neck obsequious bow'd, Own'd the great Monarch, and Allegiance vow'd; While his Alarms shook distant Nubia's Towr's, Nor dy'd unfelt by Ãthiopia's Pow'rs. Thus Abal reign'd in Triumph, till at last He disesteem'd, surprizing Change of Taste! Dominion, Pow'r, and Fame, which he before Did, as the Idols of his Soul, adore. Now burden'd with his Crown's oppressive Weight, The Cares of Empire and the Yoke of State, And with suspected secret Trouble pain'd He much of royal Servitude complain'd. From this Reverse of Relish known to few His Manners varied, and less princely grew. His solemn Looks and melancholy Mien Shew'd Marks of inward Grief and Wounds unseen. Oft the whole Night the Monarch wakeful lay Revolving anxious Thoughts, and oft by Day Retir'd in silent Groves he us'd to vent In mournful Sighs his hidden Discontent. Thus balancing a while he staid, but grown Ill pleas'd with long Success, and of a Throne No longer patient, did at length decree Soon of his Crown his weary Head to free. Besides the sharp consuming Cares of State, That haunt the Great and on proud Purple wait, The King perceiv'd that dimly in its Urn His wearing Lamp of Life began to burn, And thought, thus prompted by declining Age, He now should quit the busy publick Stage, And act the King no longer, but retreat To some obscure and unfrequented Seat, Where Commerce with the Gods he might enjoy, And the Remains of Life in Peace employ. In the fair Region of Duccalia's Land, That Elmedina's potent Lords Command, On the sweet Margin of a silver Flood A Fabrick fit for sweet Retirement stood. Here lavish Nature clad in bright Array Dispenses Plenty and Profusion gay; 'Midst various Pleasures ravishing to Sight, And finish'd Scenes of exquisite Delight, In a terrestrial Heav'n she seem'd enthron'd, Young Joys and laughing Graces pour'd around. The curious Trav'ller would with fruitless Toil Attempt thro' all extended Libya's Soil To find such rural Charms, on either Hand Aspiring Hills rang'd in long Order stand Sulime in Air, proud of their secret Store, But of their Height, and Strength, and Beauty more. Contiguous Trees their twining Branches spread, Grace and enrich the Mountain's lofty Head, Whence pleasant Rills of limpid Water flow Down to refresh the smiling Vale below; Where lost in Rivers they pursue their Race, With confluent Arms and wanton Folds embrace, And ling'ring leave the sweet voluptuous Place. Promiscuous Flow'rs in gay successive Bloom, That various Hue from sportive Light assume, Display their glossy Silks, the Pride of Nature's Loom; While Myrtle-Bow'rs in fragrant Verdure dress'd, And Groves with golden Luxury oppress'd, Pomgranates, Citrons, Limes, as with Design To charm the Eye, their diff'rent Pleasures joyn; And to afford the ravish'd Smell Delight Sweet-scented Spoils and balmy Steams unite, While warm soft Breathing Zephyrs thro' the Air On downy Wings the od'rous Treasure bear. The King resolv'd to this delightful Seat From Camps, and Courts, and Business to retreat, And, pleas'd his anxious Bosom to unfold, His form'd Design to favour'd Courtiers told. They much surpris'd uncommon Grief express'd, And oft their Prince with earnest Pray'r address'd, And all the Words that troubled Love could find, To touch the Monarch's Heart and change his Mind; In vainâThe King determin'd still appears Deaf to Persuasion and unmov'd with Tears. Now to the Lords assembled from the Throne In this Harangue he made his Purpose known, His Scepter in his Hand, and on his Head his Crown. Agmatians, long in Fortune's Arms caress'd, Long with successful Fields and Empire bless'd, I've run my Course, now, of the toilsome Task The just Reward, Recess and Ease I ask. See, like the Swain, his Labour done, I stand Panting for Rest and due Repose demand In Life's cool Ev'ning, but without his View Still for fresh Toil lost Vigour to renew. Nor, Subjects, think your Monarch is inclin'd By Aims ungenerous and an abject Mind; I've Things in Order of their Merit rang'd, Still my Ambition reigns, the Object chang'd. What is the State that dazzles Mortals Sight, And the proud Marks of Majesty and Might? The Cares that mingle with imperial Sway, If Wisdom holds the Scales, its Pomp outweigh. Let others Laurels, Pow'r, and Greatness claim, A brighter Course of Glory is my Aim: While Pride and Lust of Empire I subdue, And low ambitious Ends no more pursue; No more for Pow'r enlarg'd by Conquest plead, But my own Vict'ries chain'd in Triumph lead. Nor hence conclude, that Pleasures I refuse; No, I the chief and most exalted chuse, While, Care and Trouble banish'd from my Breast, I Peace enjoy and unmolested Rest: The sweet Possessions of a thoughtful Mind From Solitude deriv'd are more refin'd And grateful, than the mean Delights that please Voluptuous Minds, and loose Desires appease, Delights that Change of Age or Taste destroy, Repeated flatten, and familiar cloy. Determin'd now, Agmatians, to acquire The happy State at which my Thoughts aspire, See, I renounce my Dignity and Crown, Resign my Pow'r, and lay my Scepter down. Then the bright Symbols of supream Command He gave to high-born Bruno's faithful Hand, And thus bespoke th' august Assembly, See, From their Allegiance I my Subjects free. Now one, whose high Endowments well are known, And princely Virtues worthy of a Throne, Agmatians, chuse delib'rate, yet with speed, That may to this important Trust succeed; Whose generous Deeds and publick Aims persuade That he by Pow'r will no Man's Right invade; But will the Poor from proud Oppressours guard, Punish severe, and bountiful Reward; One that by Toil and Suff'rings oft endur'd Is for imperial Dignity matur'd; Whence he will rein his Instincts, and controul The Perturbations that distract the Soul; Just, but indulgent, as the Pow'rs supream, Will spare the Good, and Criminals condemn, And rule his Kingdom more by Love than Dread, By willing Subjects, not by Slaves, obey'd. He paus'dâAnd then his Hand upon his Breast Gracious th' assembled Lords he thus addrest; Thus I your PrinceâI errâth' Expression spare, The royal Stile I can't so soon forbearâ The Diadem have taken from my Brow, Unking'd your Sov'reign, and absolv'd your Vow. Now Farewel Empire, Farewel Pomp and State, Ye envy'd Honours that on Greatness wait. Projects adieu, adieu to publick Toil, To Triumphs, Trophies, and to hostile Spoil. My Ministers, who did my Counsels guide, And weighty Burdens with your Prince divide, Of you and State-Fatigues I take my Leave, My Thanks unfeign'd to Merit due receive. To you, my valiant Chiefs, a long Adieu. Grateful my Debt, brave Men, I pay to you That shar'd my Toil and Dangers past, and stood Expos'd to various Deaths for publick Good. Farewel, my lov'd Agmatians, to my dear And loyal People I no more appear. This last Expression of indulgent Love To loyal Subjects did the Monarch move, And touch'd his Heart so near, moist Dews apace Gush'd from his Eyes and trickled down his Face. Now from th' assembled Court the King departs; This pierc'd their Breasts and enter'd deep their Hearts. Th' Agmatian Lords, almost dissolv'd before, Their swelling Passions now resist no more, But bath'd in Tears by rival Trouble show A finish'd Triumph of ungovern'd Woe: No Fancy can suggest, no Tongue affords Sufficient Choice of strong descriptive Words, That these sad Strains of Sorrow can express, And paint this Scene of exquisite Distress. Soon as the Sun with beamy Honours crown'd Had all the adverse Stages of his Round Compleated, each great Lord and every Head Of the Plebeians now assembled, led By Views of publick Int'rest not their own, To chuse some Heroe fit to mount the Throne; Nor was the Choice deferr'd, for all decreed The British Prince most worthy to succeed Their late great Sov'reign, him they Monarch name, And Shouts of Joy th' elected King proclaim. Alfred the Just, now on a Chair of State Curious to see th' important Issue sate; Then rising from his Seat stretch'd forth his Hand And looking round did by his Mien demand AttentionâThen the Heroe Silence broke, And gracious thus th' Agmatian Chiefs bespoke; The Honour done me this auspicious Day, That would advance me to imperial Sway And fill Ambition's most enlarg'd Desire, The utmost Strains of Gratitude require. While Breath inspir'd shall feed my vital Flame, And active Spirits animate this Frame, Your Nation's Honour thankful I'll defend, Divulge your Favours and your Fame extend. But know, Agmatians, by a sacred Vow I'm strictly bound, should gracious Heav'n allow Alfred, deliver'd from my various Toil And Dangers, to regain Britannia's Isle, In War to guard my Country, and in Peace To raise her Empire and her Wealth encrease: Your gen'rous Offer hence I must refuse; Do you some wise and valiant Native chuse Of all th' illustrious Qualities possess'd That your late King, to guide you right, express'd; Who may th' Agmatian Throne applauded fill, And rule by Law and not despotick Will. He ceas'dâAnd troubled they at length resolv'd Their Fate on Alfred's Vote should be devolv'd: Then all th' assembled Chiefs the Briton pray'd To name the Heroe who should be obey'd. Then Alfred thusâLords worthy of the Throne Of Agmat to Agmatians best are known. Can I a Stranger here presume to tell What Chiefs in princely Virtues most excell? But since, if, as you ask, I give my Voice, I may procure a speedy peaceful Choice, And long Disputes and Party-Feuds prevent, To name a gen'rous Patriot I consent. Brave Golan I pronounce a Heroe fit To whom imperial Pow'r you may commit. He in the bloody Battle lately fought, To his immortal Honour Wonders wrought, And by his equal, unelated Mind, That all Distinction and Applause declin'd, And various other Virtues, has express'd Superiour Merit, and his Country bless'd. Then Agmat's Chiefs their Monarch Golan own, And judg'd him worthy of th' imperial Throne, While Hills and Dales with Acclamations ring, And echoing Shouts declare the chosen King. BOOK X. The ARGUMENT. Alfred takes Leave of the King of Agmat and his Court. Embarks and sails for Spain. Arrives at the Mouth of the BÃ¦tis or Guadalquivir, which he enters, and then goes to Hispalis, now Seville. A short Description of that City and the Country thereabout. Here the Prince learns, from British Merchants, the News of the Death of King Atulpho, and that Ethelbal his Brother succeeded his Father in the Throne. Alfred retires and spends some Time to vent his Grief. Then returns to his Ships and sails to Olysippo, now Lisbon. The Town described with the Nature of the Soil in that Part of Lusitania. Again he goes on Board, and coasts along the Country of Spain, till he arrives at Amanum, now Fontarabia in the Bay of Biscay, and having visited Sobrarbe, takes his Way to Pampelune the Capital City of Navarre. Here he was received with great Respect by Fortunio the new King. A great Plague happens among the Cattle, and Blasts of unwholsome Air destroy the Herbs and Fruits. Fortunio advises with Alfred about the most proper Measures to be taken in this Conjuncture. The Prince, having declared his Opinion that some national Crime had occasioned this extraordinary Judgement, perswades him to recall Silva from Numidia, who was once his Preceptor, and sometime a favoured Minister in his Father's Reign, and to consult him as the fittest Person to give Directions in this Posture of Affairs. Silva is sent for, and when arrived acquaints the King, that Heaven being displeased with Navarre, because the notorious Treaty-Breakers and Violaters of the publick Faith in the late Reign had been uncensured, he advises him to bring those Offenders to condign Punishment, assuring him that this Atonement being made, the Plague would be removed. Fortunio follows this Advice, and the Land was restored to Health and Plenty. Th' appointed Time for publick Joy expir'd, The British Prince, as his wise Scheme requir'd, Bade Agmat's Monarch and his Lords adieu, Intent his first great Purpose to pursue. With all the Marks of high Esteem caress'd, By Words unfeign'd and gen'rous Deeds express'd, He left th' imperial Town, and to the Port, Attended by the Chiefs of Golan's Court And shouting vulgar Crouds, he took his Way, Where three tall Ships, the King so order'd, lay For Alfred's Use; here he embark'd and soon Stood off to Sea, now did the Vessel spoon Away thro' foamy Waves before the Wind, And left the Towns and Sun-burnt Shores behind. But his bright Virtues and divine Discourse Had on the Libyans wrought with so much Force, That most inclin'd, won by prevailing Lights, To change for Christian Faith their Pagan Rites, Where some reveal'd Religion had embrac'd, Which from the Nubian Church to Agmat pass'd. Four Times th' illustrious Father of the Day Had to each adverse World dispens'd his Ray, When on the swelling Ocean Alfred's Men Clinging to Masts sublime attentive ken The Land, the Temples, and aspiring Tow'rs, That own'd the Empire of Hispania's Pow'rs. They soon the working Estuary gain, Where BÃ¦tis with her pure unbrackish Train Dilutes the season'd Waters of the Main. And now advancing on the River's Tide They view'd Delights and Wealth on either Side, Where Nature all her fruitful Pow'r employs, Wantons and triumphs 'midst ten thousand Joys; While every Vale and each exalted Hill, Improv'd by Labour and adorn'd by Skill, Like Eden's Walks the ravish'd Sight surprize, So fertile were the Fields, so soft the Skies. Here lovely Gardens rich in gen'rous Roots, Delicious blooming Bow'rs, and golden Fruits, That far in Beauty, Taste, and fragrant Smell Hesperia's Arbours and sweet Groves excell, Glow'd with the solar intercepted Light, And to the Eye disclos'd a charming Sight. At Length they came to Hispalis, the Pride Of Spain, that all her fairest Towns outvy'd In Amplitude, superb Magnificence, In publick Buildings rear'd at vast Expence, High Temples, Tow'rs, and Ornaments of State, Wonders and proud Remains of ancient Date; In AquÃ¦ducts, that Streams from far convey The Cistern fill, and make the Conduit play; In her fair Burse, rich Markets, beauteous Squares, And Piles erected for the Merchant's Wares. Nor did the loud expanded Mouths of Fame Th' Emporium's Honour with less Zeal proclaim, Whose coasting Fleets to every Nation run, Where Winds can Breath expend, or Light the Sun, And freighted from unnumber'd Shores abroad Pleasures and various Wealth at Home unload: Thus She of Trade a central Seat became, To Europe's richest Marts a rival Name. Here Alfred first from British Merchants heard, Who bent on gainful Commerce hither steer'd, That Albion's King weak and exhausted grown Had for a heav'nly chang'd his earthly Throne; That Ethelbal, by Incest after stain'd, Now in Atulpho's Stead o'er Britain reign'd. When Alfred knew these Tidings, from his Eyes Tears plenteous gush'd, and from his Bosom Sighs, That from a filial strong Affection spring To a wise Father and a gracious King. Some Weeks to silent Solitude confin'd He to express becoming Grief assign'd, Close in his Palace he his Minutes spent, Or gave in lonely Walks his Trouble vent; While sad Reflexions all his Mind engross, Now on his own, and now on Britain's Loss. The Time expir'd to decent Sorrow due, Alfred the Wonders did attentive View That Nature here or curious Art could shew. That done, their Vessels with Provisions stor'd, Leaving the splendid Town they went aboard. Steering along the Gaditanian Main They turn'd the sacred Western Cape of Spain, Then thro' th' Atlantick Ocean pass'd the Sands Where old Turdulians till'd the neighb'ring Lands. They swept the Coast of Lusitania's Realm, Nor long had work'd the Ship and ply'd the Helm, Ere to the River's Mouth they made their Way Where Olysippo's Walls the Soil survey, And to the Deep look o'er th' encircled Bay. Whose gilded Domes and Spires that glitt'ring rise With double Glory reimburse the Skies. Here num'rous Fleets unload their wealthy Stores, From Africk's Regions and Europa's Shores, From snowy Climates near the Arctick Pole, And where the British Seas or German roll. For Lusitania's Youth from thirst of Gain The various Pleasures of the Land disdain, And hardy face the Terrours of the Main; While no Advent'rers distant Realms explore With bolder Sails, nor spread their Commerce more, Till grown by Traffick opulent, the Town Takes Place among the Ports of first Renown. The Briton pleas'd observ'd the noble Tide Of wealthy Tagus, Lusitania's Pride, Whose precious Streams, so ancient Poets told, Roll to the Ocean glitt'ring Seeds of Gold. Attentive he survey'd the Soil around With rich Productions and sweet Pleasures crown'd; Pomgranates, Almonds, Olive-Yards and Vines, Whence flow the purest Oyl and richest Wines; Where the fair Orange, that in Part repell'd, In Part th' admitted solar Rays withheld, Vies with the Fruits of Andalusia's Fields, Nor to the golden Groves of Asia yields. Now, all Things seen by curious Thirst requir'd, Britannia's Heroe to his Ships retir'd; These soon unmoor'd, and all their Anchors weigh'd, Their Canvass Wings before the Gale display'd; Then plough'd the watry Gulphs, on Surges danc'd, And o'er the Ocean's furrow'd Face advanc'd; Cutting the Western Seas they pass'd the Coast, Where Durius, that Pisurga's Flood engrost Arbinco, Arva's and Estolla's Tides, Flows to the Deep and in its Bosom hides; And where Lavara stood, an ancient Town, Once rich by Trade, and still of great Renown. And now the Celtick Promontory's Head They weather'd, where the Nerian Goatherds fed Their brouzing Troops o'er shrubby Mountains spread. And next they swept the Shores, which with its Waves, The turbulent Cantabrian Ocean laves. Along the rocky Frontier now they steer'd, Where the fair Town of Bilbilis appear'd, To whose wide Haven of superiour Fame Unnumber'd Fleets from distant Nations came. The Hills around afford a gen'rous Wine, And, hence transported, celebrated Swine Of Taste delicious grace Britannia's Feasts, And more than Belgia's Boar regale the Guests. Here unexhausted precious Mines produce Unrivall'd Oar for Arms of various Use, Some fit for martial, some for rural Toil, Those to defend, and these to till the Soil. As he advanc'd he coasted near the Land That Tramontane Asturian Lords Command, The Soil by old Pesician Clans possess'd, And where Salenian Youth the Vintage press'd. He reach'd the Region where in ancient Time Amanum's Tow'rs rose in the Skies sublime, Whose Ruins Birth to Fontarabia gave, Where lofty Works drive back th' insulting Wave. This Haven gain'd, the Prince debark'd, and soon Departing hence advanc'd to Pampelune. But first he careful view'd Sobrarbe's Town Amidst the Mountains, once of chief Renown, While the first Kings, not yet in Empire great, Fixt in th' aspiring Hills their royal Seat, From the encroaching Moor a safe Retreat. And much it pleas'd the Briton's curious Taste To see amidst the Rocks this City plac't, Its Site and Walls did none superiour know, And scornful of his Arms defy'd the Foe. The Pyrenean Heaps sublime surprize And entertain the Heroe's wond'ring Eyes, High frontier Lines thrown up by Nature's Art, The rival Empires, Spain and France, to part: Their Peaks survey the Meteor-Fields below, And white in sultry Heav'ns wear unrelenting Snow. The Prince admir'd to see these Mountains rise On the South Side, in hot intemp'rate Skies, Adorn'd with Fruits and cloath'd in verdant Pride, While on the North, whence Gallia is descry'd, (So was he told) blest with indulgent Air They Russet look'd and as the Desart bare. Pleas'd he remark'd how Rivulets and Rills From weeping Rocks and perforated Hills Gush forth, and flowing down their channell'd Sides Embrace below, and form unvulgar Tides. Here Sicoris to Streams collected owes Its precious Flood, and hence fair Cinga flows, And, while swift confluent Brooks its Current raise, To fam'd Ibero's Arms her Tide conveys. Leaving these Lands with Scenes surprizing fill'd He pass'd the Fields the old Selenians till'd, Where Oregonians rural Arms employ, And where Caristian Farmers Wealth enjoy, That stretch'd along Menlasco's verdant Bank, And where the thirsty Swain Magrada drank. To Pampeluna now the Briton came, A beauteous City and of spreading Fame; She, when Navarra's Monarchs flourish'd, great In Pow'r and Wealth, became th' imperial Seat: Where lately Garcia by ill Councils sway'd With conquer'd Rivals Peace inglorious made; And then by wasting Grief of Life bereft His great Dominions to Fortunio left. He Arragonia's Cities now commands, Asturia, Biscay, and Gallicia's Lands, Acquir'd by Nuptials or successful War, Besides his ancient Kingdom, fair Navarre, And proud Castile, whose Pow'r has since engrost All Spain, but then no regal Stile could boast. He rul'd the Soil till'd by Valdurian Swains And the Cantabrians near the sandy Plains, Where the wild Deep, to which this Region gave Its Name, impetuous breaks its foaming Wave; Besides Vasconia's Tow'rs on either Side The Heaps sublime that Spain and France divide. Fortunio thus with Peace and Empire bless'd, And of such potent Provinces possess'd, Reign'd, as their Head, rever'd by Christian Pow'rs, That unsubdu'd withstood th' encroaching Moors. Alfred, with Ease refresh'd, without Delay Now to Fortunio's Court directs his Way; But first he made his Name and Nation known, His Birth and claim successive to the Throne. The King with due Respect the Prince embrac'd, And on the royal Guest great Honours plac'd; But as he more the Heroe's Merit knew, He prais'd him more, and more indulgent grew. In Dances, Feasts, and various Court Delights They oft enjoy the Days, and spend the Nights: Now by feign'd Kings see War theatrick wag'd; Now Youth in ancient manly Games engag'd. They sometimes hunt the Boar in High-lands bred, And with the Fruits of the rich Valley fed: Sometimes th' unharbour'd Stag they ardent Chace, To which the fleetest Tempest yields the Race, Till for Escape deny'd the shelt'ring Wood The Forrest's Lord submits to swim the Flood, And while the opening Hounds and eager Train Of Huntsmen fill with mingled Noise the Plain, From Hill to Hill recoiling Clamours fly, And Rocks rehallowing propagate the Cry: With so much Friendship at his royal Seat, Navarra's Monarch did the Briton treat. Mean Time the Angel of Iberia's Land, Gamel vindictive by supreme Command, Sprung with immortal Vigour from the Height Of Heav'n, and soon with unobstructed Flight Down the deep Gulphs of Ether wing'd his Way, More swift and brighter than the active Ray, The smiling Introductor of the Day. Now did the high celestial Viceroy gain The lower Skies, and saw extended Spain: With pois'd expanded Wings in Air a while He hung, and hov'red o'er Navarra's Soil. He held a dreadful Phiol, that contains Strong Lees of Wrath, fierce Plagues, &amp; wasting Pains, By ripening Age with full Perfection crown'd, Then pour'd the dire Contagion all around; Whence fatal Stores for Brutes and Plants design'd Abroad were scatter'd, while the breezy Wind Fann'd to and fro the blue malignant Breaths, Destructive Reeks and undulating Deaths. Red pestilential Vapours, noxious Dews, Such as their Labour's Bane griev'd Swains accuse, With Honey-Meteors, and wide wasting Blights, That arm'd with Vengeance take clandestine Flights, Pernicious Blasts and sultry Gleams annoy The blooming Garden, and the Field destroy. The beateous Flow'rs and Fruits and springing Corn, That bless the Valley, or the Hill adorn, Ruin'd their sudden Desolation mourn, And Meads their verdant Face to Russet turn; While Groves their sindg'd and shrivell'd Heads bewail, Wond'ring that Winter should so soon prevail. Insects engender'd by prolifick Beams From black unwholsome Vapours, putrid Steams, And crude corrupted Exhalations fly In animated Clouds along the Sky; Whence to the Earth they fall a rav'ning Show'r, And each young Bud and tender Plant devour. Unnumber'd Swarms of Flies, a dreadful Host Like that which once assail'd proud Egypt's Coast, In blasted Leaves and with'ring Branches bred On all remaining Greens voracious fed; Till they the Kingdom's Glory had defac't, And turn'd Navarra to a joyless Waste. See, Murrains now Brute Animals invade, And of the Flocks and Herds vast Havock made: Faint on the Grass, their usual Food, they lye, And, for the Guilt of Men their Masters, die; Whose Bodies cover every Hill and Plain Thicker, than after bloody Fights, the Slain. Nor did the Classes of the feather'd Kind, Unprecedented Fate! Exemption find From the Contagion's Force, but wild and tame, The Swain's Revenue, and the Sportsman's Game, In the sore Plague involv'd no longer eat, But pine and perish in Disdain of Meat. So far'd the Fish, some gasping seek the Strand, And to escape the Water swim to Land; While others kill'd, that sought in vain the Shore, Poison the Flood that poison'd them before. The Plenty gone this Region once could boast, The Vintage ruin'd and the Harvest lost, The troubled Monarch and the Court believ'd Navarra's Suff'rings ne'er could be retriev'd; They fear'd the Flocks and Herds, yet unconsum'd By the fierce Plague, were to Destruction doom'd. And now Navarra's thoughtful King, oppress'd With Sorrow, thus Britannia's Prince address'd; You, Alfred, just and as an Angel wise, Can in their Streights desponding Minds advise, Kind Remedies apply to sooth their Grief, And to uncommon Care dispense Relief: Behold, what Plagues against our Land combine O'erwhelm'd with Woe, and drench'd with Wrath divine. What can support us in our vast Distress? What can our sore Calamities redress, And Fears of more vindictive Rage suppress? The Prince reply'dâSome unaton'd Offence, It's clear, must Heav'ns Almighty Lord incense; For publick Crimes will with resistless Cries Call down due Vengeance from th' unwilling Skies; This with Contrition own'd, Heav'n will restore The Peace and Plenty you enjoy'd before. I to the King this Counsel give, intent Navarra's total Ruin to prevent. In Sun-burnt Libya near Numidia's Strand, Where not remote Tunisia's Castles stand, Silva, a pious, venerable Sage, Unhurt in Body and in Mind by Age, An Anchorite does solitary dwell, And by Devotion in his lonely Cell He fore-enjoys his bless'd celestial Home, And prepossesses endless Life to come, Your native Subject, once renown'd in Spain, And dear to all the just in Garcia's Reign. He, while he sacred Commerce keeps above By pure Desires and Strains of ardent Love, From publick Cares and busy Life retir'd, Is with prophetick Energy inspir'd. Let Messengers be soon dispatch'd to bring This godlike Prelate to Navarra's King. He'll tell what Breaches of th' Almighty's Laws Are of his Anger and your Woes the Cause; And to the King will the right Means display Heav'n to atone, and turn fierce Wrath away From this afflicted Realm, then she shall rear Her drooping Head and more august appear. He ceas'dâThe King express'd his great Surprize By mingled Joy and Wonder in his Eyes; Alfred, said he, your Words my Soul revive, Is then my sage Preceptor still alive? Is Silva safe? Did Heav'n defeat his Foes, And lead him thro' his Labyrinth of Woes? I long to see his venerable Face, And in my Arms with Ardour to embrace The just Instructor of my youthful Age, These Tidings to Navarre great Good Presage. Does Silva live? Then universal Fame That told his Death no more can Credit claim. Unrivall'd Silva to Fortunio dear, How much are thy wise Counsels wanted here? Forthwith I'll Envoys to Numidia send, That may the Prelate to the Court attend, Where as a Guardian Angel he'll appear To save Navarra and remove her Fear. Three Lords deputed, Sancho at their Head, By Silva lov'd and by his Counsel led, Forthwith obedient to the King's Command Advanc'd with Speed to parch'd Numidia's Strand, Where soon arriv'd they enter'd on the Road By Alfred mark'd to Silva's mean Abode. They found the Prelate in his Hermite's Cell, Where heav'nly Joys and peaceful Pleasures dwell. Now the King's Message they at large unfold, And sad Navarra's sore Affliction told: Then saidâFortunio, whose hard Fate requires Consummate Wisdom, at his Court desires Just Silva's Presence, you'll the Way explain, How his griev'd Realm Heav'ns Favour may regain. The Sage, tho' all the Splendor of the Great Could ne'er have drawn him from his lonely Seat, So much he lov'd sweet Solitude, obey'd Fortunio's Pleasure, by the Prospect sway'd Of shewing Means to cure Navarra's State, Remove her Suff'rings, and reverse her Fate. And now the joyful Lords the Sage convey'd To the safe Port where their tall Vessel staid: They reach'd the sandy Margin of the Main, Embark'd, put off to Sea, and stood for Spain. While o'er the Deep, shov'd by auspicious Gales, The Vessel flew with wide expanded Sails, The venerable Man these Words addrest To SanchoâCourteous Lord, at my Request, Tell what important Incidents of late Have happen'd, that affect Navarra's State. Then Sancho thus beganâSince Libya's Shore An Exile you approach'd, the haughty Moor, That Pow'r and Fame with ardent Thirst pursu'd And Southern Spain already had subdu'd, Advanc'd his Arms, and with collected Pow'rs Assail'd and conquer'd high Toledo's Tow'rs: Then spoil'd the Country, num'rous Captives made, Castles surpriz'd and Towns in Ashes laid. Garcia, this hostile Progress to prevent And drive the Moor, a valiant Army sent By Raymir led, a Chief in Battle try'd, The Moor's great Terrour and Navarra's Pride. They met and by heroick Impulse warm Commenc'd on either Side the martial Storm. Contested was the Field and bloody, while The Foes for Vict'ry strove with doubtful Toil: At length the Moors dishearten'd left the Plain Deform'd with Rout and Slaughter, and to gain Their shelt'ring Forts precipitate their Flight, Sav'd by their Speed and cover'd by the Night. Judging this Blow would much the Moor enrage And make him war with double Vigour wage, With anxious Care his Thoughts the Monarch bent By new Brigades his Army to augment; Resolv'd the Moors swift Progress to restrain And guard the Northern Provinces of Spain: Then he engag'd the Christian Potentates, And chiefly Roscinonia's warlike States, Against the common Foe to draw their Swords, And join his Host to quell unchristian Lords. At the first Opening of expected Spring Navarra's Chief, obedient to the King, Led forth his Army and his brave Allies The fierce and treach'rous Libyan to surprize. The Foe awaken'd at our loud Alarms Gather'd a mighty Host, and bold in Arms Pitch'd on Toledo's Frontiers to oppose Th' advancing Cohorts of united Foes. The Armies join'd, a furious Fight ensu'd And dubious hung, at length the Moors subdu'd To Raymir's conqu'ring Troops reluctant yield, And to the Victor-Christian left the Field. Two signal Battles more the Libyan King, In Autumn one, one early in the Spring, To Raymir lost; and now, where-e'er he came, Repeated Triumphs rais'd to Heav'n his Fame; Still new Atchievements Lawrels new afford, Till from the Terror of the Heroe's Sword, As he advanc'd, the Foe before him flew, And into Towns of Strength his Cohorts threw. Wide Tracts of Land, strong Forts, and Tow'rs he took, Till the proud Moor's enfeebled Empire shook, And soon had fall'n by mighty Raymir's Force, Had not ill Counsels stopt his Glory's Course: For now the vanquish'd Moor, exhausted left Of Treasure, and of Vet'ran Troops berest, Resolv'd to purchase Friendship with Navarre, And win by Treaty what they lost by War. Some Lords in Power, who envy'd Raymir's Fame And made the highest Dignities their Aim, Gain'd by the Moor to favour his Design And their great Prince to Amity incline, Garcia by subtle treach'rous Arts addrest, And fir'd with various Jealousies his Breast, Till he resolv'd to sheath his conqu'ring Sword, And treat for Friendship with Toledo's Lord. A sep'rate Peace ensu'dâNavarra's Shame, And Blot immortal on that Monarch's Name! For we, unheard of Conduct! now restore All that our Arms had wrested from the Moor, And gave the Vanquish'd more fair Towns and Land Than they, had they been Victors, could demand. Mock'd and deserted by unjust Navarre, Th' Allies, unable to sustain the War, Were forc'd such Terms of Friendship to receive As the imperious Moor was pleas'd to give. Raymir, who still at publick Welfare aim'd Indignant saw Navarra's Guilt proclaim'd, And soon with Age and heavy Grief oppress'd Resign'd his Life, by each good Subject bless'd. He ceas'dâAnd rev'rend Silva grateful paid Thanks for the free Discourse by Sancho made: Then anxious in his Mind revolv'd the State Of sad Navarre, and much bewail'd her Fate. Now, with a prosp'rous Wind the Ocean crost, The joyful Lords regain'd the adverse Coast, And came to LandâThen kneeling on the Shore Silva with outspread Arms did Heav'n adore, And prais'd the Care that, from the Sun-burnt Strand Of Libya, brought them to Iberia's Land. And then to reach his Native Soil intent He first his Steps to fam'd Valentia bent, Th' Abode of one of Spain's first mitred Pow'rs, Proud of illustrious Domes and lofty Tow'rs. They rested here, and at the Dawn of Day To Pampelune with Speed pursu'd their Way; And when the Prelate enter'd first the Lands Obedient to Fortunio's high Commands, He sigh'd and wept to see the Woods defac't, The Gardens wither'd and the Fields laid waste; The running Streams with putrid Fish defil'd, And Plains, of Verdure, Flocks, and Herds, despoil'd; Then saidâHow sad a Fate is this! and mourn'd O'er fair Navarra to a Desart turn'd. Now pious Silva at the late Retreat Of solar Light approach'd th' Imperial Seat, And there arriv'd the Prelate soon retir'd To seek the Rest his weary Limbs requir'd: But prost'rate on the Ground he first the Lord Of Heav'n and Earth with ardent Zeal implor'd His Minister of Vengeance to recall, Lest this great Nation should entirely fall By the destroying Angel's secret Sword; And that, the Plagues remov'd, might be restor'd Mild genial Show'rs and salutary Air Which suff'ring Nature's Ruins might repair. Nor fruitless were his CriesâTh' eternal Mind To pity more than Punishment inclin'd, Mov'd by the pious Prelate's fervent Pray'r, Decreed the Land, if penitent, to spare. Then the great Seraph President of Spain Descended, gracious Heav'n did so ordain, With rapid Flight thro' all th' Etherial Space, Youth in his Eyes and Gladness in his Face, And with a mild celestial Air addrest Just Silva risen from refreshing Rest, And thus bespoke himâBy supreme Command I come an Envoy to Navarra's Land From Seats of Bliss, that all her Sons may know To your Devotion what these Kingdoms owe. Then tell your Monarch that the black Offence Which caus'd th' Almighty's hot Displeasure, whence Inflicted by Command Navarra's Woes Destructive Plagues and Desolation rose, Is this, That Garcia's Counsellours remain From Justice screen'd in this indulgent Reign, Who, impious and in Adulation skill'd, With Passions vile and faithless Maxims fill'd Their Monarch, he inspir'd by them betray'd His Faith, and broke the solemn Leagues he made With neighbouring Powers, and did at length forsake Faithful and firm confed'rate States, and make Inglorious Friendship with the sinking Moor, And thus renounc'd the sacred Oaths he swore. Then would Fortunio wrathful Heav'n atone, Succour his People and secure his Throne; Would he restore the Kingdom's Joy, and see From vengeful Plagues his blasted Country free; At his Tribunal let them be arraign'd Who Treaty-breaking Principles maintain'd, By whose Advice the King his Promise broke, And mock'd the Pow'r supreme, whom perjur'd Crowns provoke: This to Navarra Heav'n will reconcile; Then verdant Riches thro' the Fields shall smile, And plenteous Harvests bless the teaming Soil. He saidâand sprung with swift angelick Flight From these low Gulphs to the high Seats of Light. The solar Orb had now brought back the Day When Silva to the Court directs his Way, Where all receiv'd the welcome reverend Guest With Love and Joy in strongest Marks exprest. Then thus the King the pious Sage addrest. Silva, you timely here arrive to tell What Means the Storms of Vengeance may dispell That still continue to afflict the Realm, While Floods of Wrath divine o'er sad Navarra whelm. Say what can backward drive the swelling Tide? He ceas'dâAnd faithful Silva thus reply'dâ The Lord of Armies has his Envoy sent From Heav'n, this Realm's Destruction to prevent; He bade me make distress'd Fortunio know The only Means that can remove your Woe; Then the great Message with attentive Ear And pious Awe, Navarra's Monarch, hear. What makes th' Almighty in Displeasure frown, And on this Nation pulls such Vengeance down, Is thisâThat erring Pity you express, Mercy unjust, and cruel Tenderness, While Criminals of State evade the Laws, Who of the Kingdom's Ruin are the Cause; Who void of Honour taught their Prince the Way To slight his Vows and Schemes perfidious lay. Kings that in Wrath such Officers pursue And make them Victims, to their Duty true, Give God, their Country, and Mankind, their due. Angels and Men with just Delight behold The Impious suffer, who in Treason bold By false destructive Lights their Prince misguide, State-Honour mock, and publick Faith deride. At your high Bar be then the Lords arraign'd, Haughty and hard, tho' deep with Guilt distain'd: And on their Heads the Stroke of Justice deal, This Wound will that, they gave their Country, heal. Heav'ns mighty King, that earthly Kings ordains And to their Hands commits the sacred Reins Of Government, 'tis true, will long forbear; But will he always black Offenders spare? Heavy and slow his Storms of Vengeance rise, And hov'ring hang and linger in the Skies; His ripening Thunder murmurs long, before It bursts its Prison and begins to roar; But then the finish'd Bolt, to strike him dead, Exploded flies against the Rebel's Head; He, sad Conviction! then will ruin'd know That patient Justice but deferr'd the Blow. Should Kings at Guilt enormous still connive, And to excell eternal Goodness strive? Vindictive Rigour should they still decline? And aim at Pity greater than divine? Whene'er Compassion triumphs at the Cost Of Justice, Monarchs cannot Virtue boast: Pity is Weakness, when it breaks a Trust, And Mercy is a Vice, when 'tis unjust. Pity and Pow'r unrul'd by Reason bring A like great Ills to Subjects and their King, While each to act without Restraint contends, And each by Turns establish'd Law suspends; Thus Mercy's self, that no Confinement knows, As well as boundless Pow'r Oppression grows. Most Kings, 'tis true, that from right Maxims swerve Despotick Lust and Aims ambitious serve, And strengthen'd with usurp'd licentious Pow'r Invade the Subject and the Land devour: But some, tho' few, of too indulgent Mind No useful Anger nor Resentment find: Ill judging they such Clemency affect, As Reason will not own, nor Law direct: They spare black Crimes, or if th' Offenders try'd They rig'rous wrest the Law to Mercy's Side. Then just Fortunio act a vig'rous Part And banish false Compassion from your Heart. As your good Subjects feel your tender Care, Let Criminals your righteous Vengeance bear, That to their solemn Oaths and Vows unjust Betray'd their Prince, and broke their publick Trust; Lest this audacious Tribe from Terrour free, And bold by undeserv'd Impunity, New treach'rous Schemes of Mischief should create, Disturb the Throne and re-embroil the State: Thus Heav'n aton'd soon gracious will restore The Joys and Plenty you possess'd before. He saidâThe King with fix'd Attention heard The Prelate, who a Minister appear'd From Seats above by Heav'ns Commission sent Navarre's entire Destruction to prevent; And thus reply'dâYou, Silva, pious, wise, And just, I still esteem'd, what you advise Is ReasonâThen, Heav'n's Anger to appease, He issu'd out his high Command to seize Lopez, Alonso, Tulga, Chiefs of those That on their Country brought unnumber'd Woes, And Victor Garcia sold to vanquish'd Foes. The great Offenders, by the Marshals sought And to the King's august Tribunal brought, Now by his Procurator stood accus'd That they their Monarch's Favour had abus'd, Their native Land and their high Trust betray'd, And with the sinking Foe perfidious made Destructive Peace, and ignominious left Confed'rate Pow'rs of promis'd Aid bereft, And by designing Counsels won their Lord To slight his Oaths and break his sacred Word. The Crimes objected evident appear By Proofs conspicuous and as Noon-Day clear, Nor could convincing Light be wanting here; For Earth and Heav'n, Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all Mankind and Angels at th' Accuser's Call Would Witness bear that the three Lords arraign'd With the black Deeds alledg'd were deeply stain'd. Judg'd Guilty and condemn'd they were convey'd To the State-Prisons and in Fetters laid: And when the Morning Ray with early Flight Had streak'd the azure Skies with Purple Light, Led by the Guards from the high City Gate, While shouting Crouds applaud their righteous Fate They suffer'd painful Death and publick Shame, The just Attendants that their Guilt became. Ne'er did Offenders so unpity'd die, Scarce in the Throng was seen one weeping Eye; But signal Marks of general Joy exprest How much Mankind perfidious Arts detest. Atonement made, Heav'n spar'd the wasted Land, And bade the bright Destroyer stop his Hand. Obedient he his dreadful Plagues withdrew, And back to Heav'n thro' the wide Vacant flew. Navarra now no more her Suff'rings mourn'd, While Nature's fruitful Energy return'd Which with Abundance soon the Valley bless'd, And Groves and Gardens in new Verdure dress'd. Wholsome the Air, the Seasons fruitful grew, And the sick Herds and Flocks fresh Vigour knew: Navarre recover'd rais'd her drooping Head, While Joy and Plenty o'er the Nation spread. So when King David had by Heav'n's Command, To stop the Famine raging in the Land, Given up the Sons of Treaty-breaking Saul To suffer shameful Death, and Victimes fall To please the Gibeonite, rich Crops of Corn, A welcome Blessing, all the Plains adorn; Verdure the Woods, Fruits every Garden grace, And beauteous Flowers Bloom gay on Nature's Face; While meagre Famine with her ghastly Train, Consuming Sickness, Grief, and howling Pain, From Judah fled to Southern burning Sands, Or Northern bleak inhospitable Lands. Then Alfred thus Navarra's King addrest; Joy undissembled rises in my Breast, That in Numidia's distant Hills you sought, And back to Pampelune wise Silva brought. Conducted by his Counsels you'll regain Heav'n's Favour and in Joy and Plenty reign. Inspir'd by him (illustrious was the Deed!) You made three unrelenting Traytors bleed. Ages to come this Justice will proclaim, And with Applauses crown Fortunio's Name. Silva is able, unreproach'd, and just, Fit to discharge the most important Trust. He'll teach industrious Rules of Life, and show How Arts may flourish and the Kingdom flow In Wealth, and great and formidable grow. How was I joy'd to hear the King declare He would no Creatures of the Traytors bear, Resolv'd the treach'rous Faction to disgrace, And Silva's Friends in their high Station place, Patriots for great Capacity renown'd, And to their Trust still just and faithful found. This wise this happy Reformation made, Your Hands a strong Foundation will have laid, While you possess the Throne, in Peace and War To bear the Pow'r and Glory of Navarre He saidâAnd mild Fortunio thus reply'd; Silva, that form'd my Youth, shall be my Guide In Things important that regard the State, Or to the Welfare of the Church relate. His wise Suggestions will true Lights afford When to make Peace, and when to draw the Sword; How to suppress intestine Discontent, Calm growing Heats, and civil Strife prevent. Then did the King the reverend Sage entrust, Able in Council and in Action just, With Pow'r to banish at one brave Effort The Guilty, and suspected from the Court; Dismiss the Cohorts that the Lords obey'd While they their Monarch and Navarre betray'd, And break their Chiefs; then to give loyal Hands Try'd in severest Times all great Commands. This Silva didâAnd from that happy Hour, Subtile Contrivance, Int'rest, Gold, and Pow'r The sinking Faction long employ'd in vain In a high Post one Traytor to maintain. Now mutual Leave the Prince and Monarch took With tender FriendshipâAlfred then forsook Fortunio's royal Palace, and decreed O'er the high Hills for Gallia to proceed, To view the Tow'rs and Towns of wide Command, And the chief Joys, that crown the happy Land: But ere the Briton from the Court withdrew He Silva kind embrac'd, and bade the Sage adieu. BOOK XI. The ARGUMENT. Alfred takes Leave of the Court of Navarre. Enters the Country beyond the PyrenÃ¦an Hills, in his Way to Tolose, thence he journeys on to Burgundy. The Towns, Rivers and the Countries describ'd, where he pass'd. He arrives at Diona or Dijon the Capital of Burgundy. Is made known to Rod'rick the King. An Account of that Prince's unparallell'd Avarice, and the Violence and Oppression us'd by him to amass Riches, and extort vast Sums from his Subjects. Alfred having view'd what was remarkable in this City, and being ready to take his Journey from thence to the Court of France, receives an Embassy from Fortunio, to inform him, that the discarded Ministers and their Party had taken up Arms against him, and joyn'd their Troops with those of the Moorish King of Toledo; upon which he earnestly requests the Prince to come back to Navarre, and assist him with his Arms and Advice. Alfred hastens to Pampelune, which breaks his Design of going to Paris; and being plac'd at the Head of Fortunio's Army, advances towards Toledo, near which Place the Enemy was posted. The Prince attacks their Troops, and puts them to Flight, and so closely pursues them with his Forces that they enter Pell-Mell with the Foe into the City; by which Means the Town is taken, and the Enemies throwing down their Arms, submit to the Mercy of Alfred. He gives them their Lives, and orders that the Rebell Subjects af Fortunio should be confin'd, till their Sovereign had declar'd his Pleasure concerning them. Britannia's Prince now gain'd Segovia crown'd With proud aspiring Turrets, and renow'd, For woolly Wealth, above Apulia's Fleece, That in Sicilia spun, or that in Greece, Whence Garments made of fine unrivall'd Thread The British Heroe's Admiration bred: Which to excell scarce Persia's Silks presume, Venetia's Labour, or Liguria's Loom; By this the People gainful Trade uphold, While Art and Nature they exchange for Gold. Next to the splendid City Alfred came That owes to CÃ¦sar her imperial Name, Which on the Flood of fam'd Iberus stands O'erlooking num'rous Towns and distant Lands, And sways the Province by her high Commands: From fertile Glebe her Tow'rs in Ether rise, The Air salubrious and serene the Skies: Here Sons of Science own a peaceful Seat, And at their Founder's Cost luxurious eat; Where pamper'd Monks of Ignorance profound Pass lazy Life, in Ease and Riot drown'd: For in this stupid Age averse to know, The ebbing Streams of Learning ran so low, That Albion's Heroe in the Schools could find Volumes alone of legendary Kind, Or Grecian Fathers ill to Latin turn'd, Whence he the Springs of Erudition mourn'd. The British Prince the Region round admir'd, That with prolifick solar Heat inspir'd, Impregnated with chearing Brooks and Rills, Streaming Eruptions from the neighb'ring Hills, And oft refresh'd with tepid, genial Show'rs, Unnumber'd Blessings from her Bosom pours; While fruitful Groves, Limes, and Pomgranates grace With mingled Beauty's Nature's blooming Face. Bowels of Marble streak'd with curious Stains, And Porph'ry mark'd with winding bloody Veins, In Heights above, and Rocks beneath the Ground, Are by the searching Miner plenteous found; Where Walls and Pillars for the Dome are sought, And Busts and Figures for the Palace wrought. The Delver here, besides metallick Oars, Oft Alabaster meets, and Chrystal Stores, As if the pure coagulating Snow, By Petrefaction grown unapt to flow, Had left its floating Station in the Sky, And chose in subterranean Beds to lye. The British Heroe these new Objects view'd With great Delight, and then his Way pursu'd. He pass'd the fertile Vales and happy Lands Where Cinga flows and fair Ilerda stands, Where Sicoris revives the smiling Plain While golden Sands enrich his silver Train, And (Fame so publish'd) where its Current flows On the green Banks its yellow Treasure throws; Hither, their rural Labour left, the Swains Repair to gather up the splendid Grains Richer than those they reap upon the Plains. He view'd the Meads once by the Ligyan mow'd, The Fields by Castellanian Farmers sow'd, And those on Julian Colonies bestow'd: Next saw the Town by the old Rhodians rear'd, Who hither from their Isle for Traffick steer'd; Then gain'd by toilsome Steps the hilly Land That strong Perpignan's Castles now Command, Where ancient Roscinonia's Turrets rose To which the Realm its Appellation owes. With much Fatigue Britannia's Prince at last Thro' Ways abrupt the steepy Mountain past; Then to Narbona's lofty Gates they came, Whence the fair Region once deriv'd its Name That from the Pyrenean Hills extends To the high Alps, where modern Gallia ends: Here Helvian Pow'rs and Allobrogian Lords, Felauni, Salvians nam'd in old Records, VolscÃ¦, Rutunians, who for Empire warr'd, Canton'd by settled Bounds the Country shar'd: In these sweet Skies high Rome her Natives plac'd, And with aspiring Piles the City grac'd, A Capitol adorn'd at vast Expence, Artful Canals, the Works of Toil immense, And Theatres august, whose Pomp and Pride With potent Rome when in her Glory vy'd. Here, while a Time for due Repose they staid, Th' attentive Prince the wond'rous Scenes survey'd. He then advancing o'er delightful Plains By easy Journeys high Tolosa gains, Of all the beauteous Towns the awful Head Thro' Occitania's spacious Province spread. He much admir'd her proud Magnificence, The Domes for Pray'r, and Castles for Defence; The gilded Turrets, and the Walls sublime, That scarce perceiv'd the wasting Force of Time, And stately Buildings, that on either Side The ample Streets, express unrivall'd Pride. The Heroe now the neighb'ring Region views, Where Nature fond her Riches to diffuse Indulgent scatters with a lavish Hand Her Gifts, and crowns with Luxury the Land, While Hills and Vales abundant Stores produce For Pleasure these, and those for needful Use. The Prince observ'd in all this chearful Race No Saturnine, no sow'r or joyless Face; No Loss foreseen, or unexpected Stroke Of adverse Fate, their steady Temper broke, Who always pleas'd and still in Humour gay To Cares by Turns apply'd, by Turns to play. Oft Alfred said, sweet Country, lovely Skies Whence constant Joy and Mirth unceasing Rise! Yet right he judg'd that oft their Strains of Mirth Deriv'd from native Levity their Birth, And unreflecting Indolence that here In every Rank did prevalent appear. Now he departed to renew his Toil, And much the City prais'd and much the Soil. Leaving Tolosa's Tow'rs their Way they sped To reach Divona fair Burgundia's Head: When Guithun thus to Albion's Prince applies; This charming Country to my wond'ring Eyes A Theatre appears, which Nature's Skill Does with unrivall'd Decorations fill: How rich a Land! what balmy Breezes blow! And thro' the Valleys what sweet Rivers flow! What Odours, what pure Draughts of Air inspire The breathing Pow'rs and fan the vital Fire! Hark, how around the Birds melodious sing Pearch'd in the Grove or wasted on the Wing! How Nature triumphs, and in every Place How the glad Plains display a smiling Face! O happy, happy Natives, if they find That these soft Regions don't dissolve the Mind, And indispose them by voluptuous Charms For Letters, Labour, and the Warriour's Arms! He saidâAnd now they fam'd Nemausus gain'd Where Marks of Rome's imperial Pow'r remain'd, Whose Lords once rul'd this Land by Arms subdu'd: The stately Amphitheatre they view'd, Which more entire, is only overcome In Amplitude by the proud Pile at Rome. Here Gladiators oft engag'd in Fight With fierce wild Beasts for wilder Mens Delight. The AquÃ¦duct, that o'er a River pass'd On Arches, wondrous Sight! on Arches plac'd, And for their naval Fights by Land supply'd Th' extended Basin with a plenteous Tide, They saw; and next they reach'd Avignion's Tow'rs, Since rul'd by papal delegated Pow'rs; They prais'd the Town, tho' not of vast Extent, Yet beautiful, and clean, and opulent; And from the Walls view'd the wide Fields around With smiling Joys and various Riches crown'd. Here golden Groves, that fruitful Heads display Drink the bright Sun and qualify his Ray, Diffuse the temper'd Lustre thro' the Sky, And with their Beauty captivate the Eye. There far extended lovely Almond Rows, Voluptuous Scene! their flow'ry Pride disclose. Here balmy Jes'mine, there the Myrtle Bow'r On the soft Air sweet-scented Vapours pour. The artful Worms that on the Mulb'rry feast, In whose rich Labour high-born Lords are drest, There spin their Webb with self-destructive Care, And for the Loom their precious Spoils prepare. Unnumber'd Births rise from the teaming Soil, Pure Grain and Saffron, gen'rous Wine and Oyl, Pomgranates, Figs delicious white and blue, Sweet Pears and Apples of a lovely Hue; A long successive Harvest of Delights The Lord enriches and the Swain requites. Leaving these Seats they pass'd the fruitful Plain Wash'd by the rapid Rhone's interfluent Train, And reach'd Valencia, near whose lofty Walls Down the flat Land the winding River falls: On the South Side they saw a Mountain rise Which, bless'd with fertile Glebe and mod'rate Skies, Boasts a delicious Wine of spreading Fame That from a Hermite's Cott derives its Name; To this submit Florentia's Purple Spoils, The Growth of Spain, and of the happy Isles. Hence they advancing to Lugdunum came, To the august Lutetia next in Fame, Where Rhodanus and fair Saona's Tide Meet and embrace and mingling Currents glide. And here a while the curious Briton staid, And the rich City with Delight survey'd; Admir'd her Beauty and Magnificence, And publick Buildings rais'd at vast Expence: He learn'd, that Merchants oft with Toil and Sweat Arrive at this fair Town, this central Seat And Mart of Commerce, from Germania's Land, And from the Hills Helvetian Lords command, To fetch rich Silks and fine-spun Linnen Home, The proud Production of Lugdunum's Loom. Then from the Tow'rs with Pleasure he survey'd The verdant Valley's flow'ry Wealth display'd, Which the sweet Streams of Rhodanus divide That this and that Way spreads his wanton Tide, And thro' the Pastures draws his silver Train, Delightful Prospect! to enrich the Main. The Meads &amp; Groves &amp; Gardens from th' Embrace Of the prolifick River in his Race Wear flow'ry Honours and a blooming Face. On either Margin of the fruitful Stream Promiscuous Trees, that from the sult'ry Gleam Shelter the Grazlers and adorn the Flood, The fertile Soil's spontaneous Offspring stood. Here 'midst the trembling Leaves the feather'd Quire To sooth the Skies and charm the Swain conspire; Challenge each other by their daring Notes, And strain for Conquest their melodious Throats, Till some o'ermatch'd by Rivals bold and strong Fall in the Strife and perish by their Song, As Alfred these chief Towns with Pleasure view'd, His great Design attentive he pursu'd, While eager to indulge his curious Taste In different Realms he different Customs trac'd. Now after various Joys and various Toil At length they enter'd fair Burgundia's Soil, Where while the British Heroe journey'd on, He prais'd the Region that the fruitful Soan Laves with its Current, and the Hills surveys Where the fam'd Vine its Purple Pride displays Which an unrivall'd gen'rous Juice affords Fit for the Banquets of assembled Lords, Sparkling as Diamonds and as Rubies bright, While mantling Stars adorn its Head, the Sight And ravish'd Taste it does at once Delight. Then Guithun thus began,âWe justly prize These Fields and Gardens and indulgent Skies. The Mountains here are cloath'd with gameful Woods, There murm'ring Fountains and lascivious Floods Refresh the thirsty Meadows, and their Face With verdant Joys and flow'ry Beauties grace: Here lowing Herds the springing Pastures fill, There waving Crops of Corn enrich the Hill, While lovely Prospects, that just Bounds restrain, With greater Pleasure Trav'lers entertain, Than where no rising Lands confine the Eye Lost in transparent Gulphs of endless Sky. See, while the Swain improves the fertile Soil, The Hills rejoyce and the sweet Valleys smile; Not so the People; They their Fate deplore, Grip'd by Oppression and in Plenty poor. They plant and sow the Fields with Sweat and Care, But Spoilers from the Land the Harvest bear; Thus they th' industrious Farmer's Hopes destroy, And all his Labour cruelly enjoy; Sad Marks of Trust abus'd and lawless Might; That robs the People and usurps their Right! The Britons now to fair Divona came Of present Greatness proud, and ancient Fame. The Temples much, that high in Air aspire, And much the stately Buildings they admire; But griev'd to see the People's Looks express Such Signs of anxious Care and deep Distress, Who gaul'd by lawless Pow'rs that rul'd the State Groan'd in Despair and mourn'd their hapless Fate. And now conducted to Burgundia's Court, Which to the Strangers seem'd more like a Fort, That Ditches wide extended and profound And double Walls for sure Defence surround, Than an imperial Seat; for Rodrick, who Burgundia's Sceptre sway'd and had in view No End but Heaps of Treasure to collect, That he unmeasur'd Riches might protect And dreaded Insults and wild Rage repell Had turn'd his Palace to a Citadel. No panting Swain in Libya's sultry Sands With greater Thirst the cooling Stream demands, Nor hungry Lion at the Fall of Day Forsakes his Haunt more eager of his Prey, Than avaricious Rodrick Wealth pursu'd, And still in Want encreasing Treasure view'd. Midas, Pigmalion, CrÅsus, Kings of old Fam'd for their Lust exorbitant of Gold, With this Burgundian Potentate compar'd Would be but frugal Managers declar'd: New Acquisitions still Desire inflame, Nor could th' exhausted World his Passion tame. To drain the Nation and augment his Hoards, He to his Chiefs and ministerial Lords, Prefects of Cities and provincial Lands, Issu'd unjust, and oft renew'd Commands To make the Subject Sums enormous pay, And on the Realm oppressive Burdens lay. As these State-Leeches suck'd the People's Blood, And from their Veins transfus'd the vital Flood Into their own, so when their Hoards were swell'd, Rodrick the griping Governours compell'd By Force to vomit up their plunder'd Store, And thus encreas'd his Wealth immense before. Mean Time the murm'ring Nation to restrain, Whose Towns of raging Cruelty complain, He thro' the Kingdom Towers and Castles built, And paid vast Armies to defend his Guilt; Nor on their Deeds licentious would be frown, To keep the Cohorts steady to the Crown. Burgundia's Treasure Rodrick thus engrost, And fill'd his Coffers at the People's Cost, Coffers between high secret Walls immur'd, Or in deep Vaults and guarded Forts secur'd, Which he forgot long buried under Ground, And left by future Princes to be found. On avaricious Parcimony bent The King to save Expence inglorious went From Chief to Chief, from Lord to Lord to eat, And they in Turn th' ungen'rous Monarch treat. Rare was he known, so much his Coin he spar'd, The Labours of the Heroe or the Bard, Or active Patriot's Merit to reward. And when he gave, his Gold did from him part Like Life-Blood issuing from his aking Heart, And then the scanty and unprincely Dole, Declar'd the abject Meanness of his Soul. Soon as this private Court the Briton view'd, Which not the awful Face of Empire shew'd, Guithun the pious Heroe thus address'd; How ill are Pow'r and Majesty express'd By such illib'ral mean and sordid Ways, That must Contempt, not Veneration raise? Splendor and Pomp that vulgar Eyes engage, Magnificence and noble Equipage, And the proud Ensigns of imperial State, Will Rev'rence, Wonder, and Esteem create: Else Monarchs would not, as they ought, appear The Objects of Regard nor useful Fear: For still we find Plebeian Minds are sway'd By strong Impressions on the Senses made. Assign to Men in Pow'r a mean Abode, Dismount the PrÃ¦tor from his Steed, disrobe The Judge, and strip them of their num'rous Train, And would they long their Dignity maintain? Besides as Kings by Lust of Gold create Contempt, they bring great Mischiefs on the State; For while the publick Treasures hoarded sleep Unrefluent in the Monarch's stagnant Deep, The sad exhausted Provinces bewail Their Fate, while all Recruits obstructed fail. Did not the Streams, that with their silver Train Sweep thro' the Meads and seek the spreading Main, In secret Channels or in Rain return, How would the Land its Desolation mourn! Nor did th' exhaling Vapours, which supply The Atmosphere, and stock with Clouds the Sky, Come back to Earth in mild refreshing Dews, And genial Show'rs on thirsty Fields diffuse, Would not the Lands the cruel Heav'ns arraign, And of the Rapine of the Sun complain, That seiz'd their Moisture by his active Ray, Nor did the Furrows nor the Meads repay? Thus while their Wealth is in the Coffers pent Of griping Kings, sad Realms their Wants lament, And, unrefresh'd by Streams that us'd to flow Reciprocal, despond and lifeless grow. Burgundia's King to Lust of Wealth a Slave Now to the British Heroe Audience gave, And, as he decent State and Splendor scorn'd, Receiv'd him in a Chamber unadorn'd By Arras, Busts, and Pictures, with an Air Of Care and Sadness bord'ring on Despair, That all observ'd did on the Sov'reign grow, Lest in Abundance he should Famine know. Alfred, the cold Reception past, retir'd, And much the royal Miser's Fate admir'd: Then went to view the Prisons near the Court Where Lictors verst in Cruelty extort From all, suspected Riches to conceal, By Whips and Wheels Confessions, to reveal The dark Recesses where they hid their Gold, And their strong Casks that buried Jewels hold. Some to the Rack, tho' indigent were brought, To purge the Guilt of being wealthy thought; While others, who discover'd all their Store, Were still tormented to discover more. Thus did th' Iberians, who in after Times Became the Lords of Western India's Climes, A cruel, fierce, and unrelenting Race, The fairest Realms and richest Towns deface By dreadful Rapine, and with endless Loads Of plunder'd Treasure fill'd their own Abodes. Now to compleat his Scheme the Prince decreed To gain sublime Lutetia's Gates with Speed, Conscious he there a splendid Court should find, A People faithful and a Monarch kind: When brave Fuentes well to Alfred known, And Sancho, Courtiers near Fortunio's Throne, By his Command the British Prince attend In fair Divona; he their generous Friend Kindly Navarre's Ambassadours caress'd, When just Fuentes Alfred thus address'd. On you, great Briton, we commission'd wait, Whose wise Advice preserv'd Navarra's State, To bring the King's Request and Silva's Pray'r, That Alfred would to Pampelune repair. The haughty Faction who before engrost All Trusts and Pow'r, their high Employments lost, Distracted and impatient of their Fate Revil'd their Monarch and express'd their Hate Of Alfred and just Silva, who, they thought, Combin'd this Change and Revolution wrought. The furious Traytors soon in Arms engage, And meditate Revenge to sooth their Rage: Too much the poison'd Provinces support Disloyal Leaders, and arraign the Court. Sedition's growing Flames great Force acquire, Break furious out and civil Heats inspire. And now their Leaders to Moavi sent, Toledo's King, fit Envoys with Intent To gain from that fierce Monarch pow'rful Aid, To whom before their Friends Navarre betray'd. The Moor, his Pow'r ambitious to extend, Ready engag'd the Faction to befriend, And with their Forces to unite his own, To move Fortunio from the regal Throne; That done, he knew his Cohorts might with Ease As his Reward Navarre's Dominions seize; Which vastly would his Empire stretch, and lay A stable Base for universal Sway. Thus they sollicit Succours from the Moor, Help from th' Impostor Mahomet implore, And would Arabian Infidels employ Their Christian King and Country to destroy: Black Guilt! but Pride, Revenge, and Lust of Gain Grasp at all Means to ease their raging Pain. To you, illustrious Briton, we address To lend your Aid this Tempest to suppress: Thus you'll our happy Government defend, Support our Prince, and guard your mitred Friend: The Realm from Libyan Potentates assure, And Christian Faith from raging Arms secure. The Envoy ceas'dâAnd, gracious thus reply'd The British HeroeâWhat can be deny'd That Silva that Fortunio shall demand? Can Alfred such Sollicitors withstand? With Speed I'll Pampeluna's Tow'rs regain, And aid his Arms th' Assailants to sustain, Drive back the Spoilers from Navarra's Coast, And save Religion from a barb'rous Host. Now Morning Rays of heav'nly liquid Gold Exhale the Dews and the gay Heads unfold Of sleeping Flow'rs clos'd by nocturnal Cold: The Briton then Burgundia's Land forsook And to Hispania's Soil his Journey took; Where wing'd with Zeal the Heroe soon arriv'd, Whose Presence much Fortunio's Court reviv'd. Ardent the Monarch Albion's Prince carest, And all the Chiefs uncommon Joy exprest, But Silva Transport shew'd above the rest. For all presag'd the Rebels in the Field Would to his Courage and wise Conduct yield. To lead his Host the King did Alfred ask, Who undertook the military Task; With a gilt Trunchion then he grac'd his Hand, Proud martial Emblem of supream Command, In strong Belief his Sword would quell his Foes, Chastise their Pride and civil Strife compose. Th' intrepid Chief advancing at the Head Of his brave Troops warm Hopes of Conquest fed In all their Breasts, who eager to engage By threat'ning Looks express'd a loyal Rage, Denounc'd Defiance, earnest ask'd the Fight, And pre-enjoy'd the Triumph's great Delight. Moavi's Army by Almansor led, And the fierce Rebels, Velez at their Head, Advance in long Array on Blood intent, And daring Combate to the Foe present. As when renown'd Sabrina from the Main Regurgitates, and draws her refluent Train, The foamy Billows of the rushing Tide, That press and croud and o'er each other ride, Stretching their Front a furious Aspect wear, And from the Sands th' affrighted Farmer scare; The Moor's Brigade their March so forward bend, And on the Plains the growing War extend. The Squadrons shone in polish'd Armour bright, While the refulgent Sun his glancing Light From Shield to Shield from Helm to Helm convey'd, And keen Reflection on Reflection play'd. Fortunio's Warriours reach'd Titulcia's Vale, Whence Seas of Blood must soon to Heav'n exhale: The threatning Armies met, but doubtful Light Restrain'd their Fury, and defer'd the Fight. Now did the Sun gild Heav'ns Cerulean Plain, And spreading o'er the Earth his splendid Train, Call'd to his Song the Lark, &amp; to his Toil the Swain. Alfred repose for martial Labour chang'd, And his brave Troops for glorious Combate rang'd. Strong tawny Grooms his generous Courser led In the high Mountains of Gallicia bred, Of the fleet Race, which, so great Poets sung, From the prolifick Force of Zephyrs sprung, Rapid of Foot outstrip their parent Wind, And leave their swiftest Kindred Gales behind. Pricking his Ears he in the Leader's Hand Bounded, and whiten'd with his foam the Sand. The Heroe mounted with a martial Grace, Delight and Terrour mingled in his Face; And now the Armies stood in long Array Determin'd to decide th' important Day: Rage on their Brows and fierce Defiance sate, And echoing Shouts denounc'd destructive Fate. While thus the Field with warlike Clamours rung, To charge the Foe the Prince intrepid sprung. So when a fearless Lion has descry'd, From some exalted Libyan Mountain's Side, A mighty Bull Lord of the lowing Herd, Or a vast Boar thro' all the Forrest fear'd, Safe, as they think, from all invading Harms, One by his Horns, one by his Iv'ry Arms, Eager of Fight he flies to make the Foe Superiour Strength and nobler Courage know. Thus to the War the valiant Briton flew, And the first glitt'ring Jav'lin which he threw A great Arabian Champion Omir slew: The Weapon thro' his Shield and Armour went, And in his wheezing Lungs its Fury spent: A while the wounded Warriour on the Field, With Blood oppress'd and suffocated, reel'd, Then fell and groan'd and agonizing lay, His Eyes no longer conscious of the Day. Aleb a Warriour, near in Blood ally'd To their great Prophet on the Mother's Side, Broke thro' the Cohorts with intrepid Rage, In Fight the British Heroe to engage. He curst the Christian Founder and defy'd His faithful Armies with enormous Pride: Now he the fam'd Impostor earnest pray'd To guard his Person, and his Weapon aid, Then threw his Jav'lin with prodigious Might; The Christian Squadrons trembled at the Sight; From Alfred's Shield the Point unhurtful glanc'd, Who all enrag'd to the proud Foe advanc'd, And by his Faulchion's horizontal Sway Made thro' his boastful Throat a bloody Way. He fell, and rattling with his ghastly Wound Indignant star'd, and quiv'ring beat the Ground. Then Salar in a rich brocaded Vest And a bright Scarf Aurora-colour'd drest, Beauteous Bethana's Gift, (which first he wore When, at a Bull-Feast held the Year before, He fam'd for Valour and in Combate skill'd Numbers of bellowing grisly Terrours kill'd;) Rush'd forward to oppose the Briton's Course, And ready to exert his martial Force He cry'd, Bethana, Idol of my Love, Fair as the HourÃ¦ in blest Seats above, Now to thy Eyes, that Salar's Soul enthrall, This Chief a Victim shall devoted fall. The Warriour then his Spear long, bright, and vast Straining his Nerves with Force unvulgar cast: The Weapon, like a flying Serpent hiss'd Along the wounded Air, but Alfred miss'd; Who heard unmov'd and ignorant of Dread The disappointed Death sing o'er his Head. The Briton strode with Vigour o'er the Sand, His ample Faulchion flaming in his Hand, Then on the hardy Moor indignant flew And by repeated Wounds the Champion slew. Now valiant Zobar, of a noble Line Whose martial Deeds in Moorish Annals shine, That brave in Arms to signalize his Name From Carpitanian ancient Menta came Not then a City of Superiour Fame; Tho' now, grown great and wealthy at the Cost Of potent Kings, her Tow'rs of Empire boast; Boldly advanc'd and undertook the Fight, That Akem shun'd by ignominious Flight; On Alfred's Crest he dealt a noble Stroke, Which did the Heroe's Fury so provoke That he his Spear with mighty Vigour sent, Which thro' the Bowels of the Warriour went: The Moors around rush'd in, and to the Rear Bore off the wounded Champion on a Bier. He soon in deep-fetch'd Groans and tort'ring Pain Expir'd, and call'd on Mahomet in vain. Then thro the Ranks the conqu'ring Briton past, And laid on either Side the Cohorts waste. As when in Harvest Time the lab'ring Swain Bends to the Hook and cuts the ripen'd Grain, The yellow Offsprings of the Furrow feel The Edge destructive of the rural Steel, While to reward th' industrious Reaper's Toil, Thick Rows of Sheaves oppress the parent Soil. So by the Heroe's Arms the Field was spread With Spoils of War, wide Rout and Heaps of Dead. Mean Time at distance great Almansor rag'd Amidst the Troops; and Nunez, who engag'd The mighty Chief and in his Breast receiv'd The Foe's bright Weapon, fell of Breath bereav'd. Lifeless he stretch'd along the Field, and all The Christian Cohorts much bewail'd his Fall. Brave Perez from the Banks of Cinga came To guard his Country and advance his Fame, But, in full Strength and blooming youthful Pride, By the great Moor's destructive Faulchion dy'd. Alphonso, who from Saragossa's Plain Joyn'd the King's Cohorts with a num'rous Train, Beheld in Rage the African advance, And flew to charge him with his pond'rous Lance: A doubtful Fight ensu'd, the Christian cast His pointed Ash, the Death impetuous past Thro' half the Thickness of his Rival's Shield, And there stuck fast; then did Almansor wield His flaming Sword on high, (a noble Blade By skillful Varon in Toledo made,) And for a dreadful Stroke his Arm prepar'd: And while he strain'd his Joints and furious star'd, With such prodigious Strength he struck the Foe Full on his Crest, that with the vig'rous Blow The dizzy Christian stagger'd to and fro; But soon restor'd his ample Faulchion drew, And to the Moor with Rage redoubled flew. His lifted Blade came down with such a Sway As made the Plate that arm'd the Side obey, And to the Veins unguarded forc'd its Way; Whence trickling Streams of Purple Life distain His reeking Steel, and mark the red'ning Plain: But brave Alphonso slipping on the Sand Fell on his Knees, and lean'd upon his Hand. The Moor th' Advantage saw, and with his Sword Cut deep the Shoulder of the Christian Lord, And quickly had destroy'd his valiant Foe, Had not Mendoza took the second Blow, By which he fell, then dy'd with scarce a Groan, And lost, to save his Brother's Life, his own, Alphonso's Friends flew in, and on a Shield Plac'd the great Chief and bore him from the Field. And now th' elated Victor midst the Files Vast Havock made, and spread the Ground with Spoils. While thus the Champion triumph'd in the War, The British Prince beheld him from afar, And to the Foe advanc'd without Delay: The thick Brigades divide to give him Way. Almansor stopt his Progress at the Sight To undertake a more important Fight. The Heroe stood collected in his Strength With stern Defiance in his Looks, at length Alfred with hasty Strides advancing near With wond'rous Force discharg'd his glitt'ring Spear, Which pierc'd Almansor's Shield and raz'd his Ear. Swift in Exchange the Foe his Jav'lin threw That from the Briton's Buckler slanting flew And Vador, hapless Fate! at Distance slew. Long to and fro their missive Weapons past With undecisive Toil and Valour cast, Till, to determine who excell'd in Might, The Combatants prepar'd for closer Fight. A while the Champions traversing the Ground, And casting fierce and threat'ning Looks around, Took Breath, and then the Combate they renew'd, While each with dreadful Strokes his Foe pursu'd. A vast Concern in either Host appears, Now rais'd by Hopes and now depress'd by Fears, For all on this great Action seem'd to lay, As by Consent, the Fortune of the Day. So when, in Regions near the rising Sun Where Indus, Ganges, or Oraxes, run, Two mighty Elephants in Fight engage, And spend in equal Strife enormous Rage; Their vast protended Trunks each other wound, And with their Iv'ry Arms the Hills resound: Mean Time, while Vict'ry in a Balance rests, The gazing Herds, and grisly savage Beasts, Trembling with Terrour, and expecting stand Which rival Pow'r the Forrest shall command. And now the Moor determin'd to destroy His valiant Foe did all his Nerves employ And all his Skill in one prodigious stroke; But on the Briton's Shield his Faulchion broke. Alfred rush'd in, and thrust his Weapon's Point Deep in the Side between the Armour's Joint: Almansor fell, and gasping on the Ground In Search of Light turn'd his dim Eye-Balls round, And in the Pangs of Death indignant frown'd. Navarra's Troops the great Event proclaim, While Shouts of Joy divulge the Victor's Fame. The Moor's Brigades, their mighty Leader slain On whose vast Strength their Host rely'd in vain, Distrest and heartless now began to yield, And disarray'd forsook th' inglorious Field. Sancho mean Time the brave Braccarian Head, Who to the Field his Country's Squadrons led, His lifted Jav'lin in his Hand, invades Splendid in Arms the Rebells rang'd Brigades: His Weapon cast with Vigour wing'd its Way, And in young Nona's Bosom buried lay. Nor with less Fury did his second fly Against applauded Sancher standing by, And with sure Aim directed reach'd his Head, Broke thro' the Scalp and struck the Leader dead: Both grov'ling lay and in one reeking Flood Mix'd tainted Currents of disloyal Blood. The Chief projected next his glitt'ring Dart, That thro' his Cuirass peirc'd Acosta's Heart. Noman, for Arts and Sciences admir'd As well as Arms, with dauntless Courage fir'd Oppos'd the Heroe; he intrepid drew His mighty Faulchion and the Warriour slew. Fuentes Arms elsewhere the Foe invade, And midst the Rebels wide Destruction made, He peirc'd brave Gomez with his pointed Spear; And Davila who ignorant of Fear Advanc'd too late his Brother to sustain, Transfixt, expiring stretch'd along the Plain. Lerma and Mendez, near in Blood ally'd, By the victorious Leader's Weapon dy'd. Hara, a fiery Youth Vasconia's Head At factious Feasts by loose Caballs misled, That from Solorius came, whose Peaks divide The South Asturia's from the Northern Side, By luckless Fate stood in the Heroe's Way, Whose pond'rous Sword, that with a dreadful Sway Fell on his Helmet, deeply cut his Head, Dizzy he dropp'd, and thus expiring said; Curst be the Friends that Hara's Life betray'd, And to my Veins seditious Heats convey'd. I now detest the Faction I embrac't, While bold Rebellion's bitter Fruits I taste. He saidâAnd now th' encroaching Shades of Night From his dim Eyes exclude their vital Light. Anco a Lord in Pampeluna bred, Of Heart couragious but of thoughtless Head, Who by false Honour urg'd, ambitious Pride, And Party-Fury took the Rebells Side; Advanc'd the conqu'ring Leader to oppose, Whence in the Field a noble Combate rose. His Jav'lin he with mighty Vigour flung, But in his Rival's Buckler stopt it hung: He in Exchange sent his long Spear, that graz'd On his Foe's Armour and his Shoulder raz'd. The Warriours then prepar'd for closer Fight, Fuentes grasping with prodigious Might The Traytor, threw him headlong on the Ground And cross him stood; but ere the fatal Wound The Victor gave, he thus the Chief bespoke; How much thy Crimes th' Almighty's Wrath provoke? Could'st thou to sooth Revenge, unnat'ral Lord, In thy own Country's Bowels plunge thy Sword? Strive thy indulgent Sov'reign to dethrone, And make his Realm a Foreign Master own? Call in the Moor Navarra to enjoy, Impose his Prophet and our Faith destroy? Infernal Aim!âThen take thy Guilt's Desert. He saidâAnd struck his Jav'lin thro' his Heart; From his deep Wound out sprung the crimson Tide, And to the Faction dear the Rebel dy'd. Then noble Martin of Castilian Blood, And valiant Mancho, who his Arms withstood, And beauteous Ramer from Segovia's Plain Were by the loyal Chief in Battle slain, Who fill'd with Spoils and Rout the reeking Field: The Rebells stagger'd and prepar'd to yield. Then the great Traytor Velez brave in Arms And fond of martial, as of Female Charms, Advanc'd intrepid to restore the Fight. Soon as their Leader of acknowledg'd Might 'Midst his disorder'd Regiments arriv'd, He rais'd their Courage and their Hopes reviv'd. So swift, so thick, and with such Force he threw His missive Deaths, that he whole Cohorts slew. Cortez and Ronda from Cantabria's Soil Expert in Arms and vers'd in warlike Toil Along the Plain lay bleeding by his Spear, This to the Court, that to the Muses dear. His Sword depriv'd Pinta's left Eye of Sight, Th' unhappy Youth before had lost his Right, Whence without Death he felt eternal Night. Now was the War with dreadful Strokes renew'd, And Vict'ry with redoubled Heat pursu'd; While Beard to Beard the fierce Battalions stood Close as young Poplars in a thriving Wood. Still obstinate in Fight the Rebels stay, Nor to the faithful Warriours yield the Day, While now they lose and now recover Ground, Vanquish'd by Turns, by Turns with Conquest crown'd. As when two mighty Bulls, a Match in Age Of equal Vigour and of equal Rage, Contend in dubious Combate, which shall reign Lord of the Herd and Master of the Plain; With goring Arms the furious Rivals rush To Battle, and by Turns each other push With like Success, while each disdains to yield, And loses oft, and wins as oft the Field: So did Fortunio's and the trait'rous Host By balanc'd Pow'r alternate Conquest boast, Till, when the Rebels knew the Moor's Defeat, Sunk and dismay'd they from the War retreat, And in Confusion and Confed'rate Fright With their Allies precipitate their Flight. Their vanquish'd Army thus from Combate fled, And left the Field with frequent Rows of Dead, With scatter'd Arms, and Rout inglorious spread. Now Part disperse and in the Forrest hide, Or in the Mountain's secret Caves abide: Part to their Towns and rural Seats return'd, And much their Treason disappointed mourn'd: But the chief Cohorts of th' united Pow'rs March'd swift to gain sublime Toledo's Tow'rs. Britannia's Heroe brandishing his Spear Follow'd, and hung destructive on their Reer, And mark'd where-e'er he came th' extended Plain With Tracks of Blood, and Arms, and Warriours slain. Toledo conscious of the Battle lost With open Gates receiv'd the flying Host, Thro' which in Crouds the conquer'd Cohorts prest And hop'd their Walls the Victor would arrest, In vainâSo close the Troops by Alfred led Pursu'd the vanquish'd, who before them fled, That fir'd with Zeal to gain compleat Renown, They enter'd mingled with the Foe the Town: On their Brigades now Sword in Hand they flew And in vindictive Rage great Numbers slew. Velez, who first did Flames seditious spread And to the Field the Rebel Squadrons led, Inur'd to Arms and of prodigious Might In a wide Square maintain'd a desp'rate Fight; Till by Fuentes Spear transfix'd he fell And in vast Rage and Anguish sunk to Hell. The bloody Streets now fill'd with Death, at length The Moors submitted to superiour Strength, And neither able to resist nor fly Threw down their Weapons and for Mercy cry. The gen'rous Prince, who cruel Deeds abhorr'd, Restrain'd his Troops, and bade them spare the Sword, But gave Command the Moors should be confin'd, And that in Chains they should the Rebells bind, Till their great Monarch should their Fate decree; Doom them to suffer Death, or set them free. BOOK XII. The ARGUMENT. Alfred after his Victory returns to Pampelune, where he is received with great Honour. Three Lords of the Britannick Court, having found the Prince at this City, acquaint him with the Death of Atulpho; that his eldest Brother Ethelbal, who succeeded him, was soon after kill'd by a Fall from his Horse, and that Ethelred, who upon his Brother's Decease came to the Crown, was hard press'd by the Danes, and therefore earnestly desir'd that Alfred would return Home with the greatest Speed. The Prince immediately takes Leave of Fortunio, embarks, and sets sail for Britain; Lands at Isca in Devonshire, and makes Haste to find the King, who, the Day after Alfred came to Shore, received a mortal Wound in a Fight with the Danes. Alfred arrives at Ethelred's Tent, who dyed the next Morning. Alfred is proclaimed King. He marches to engage the Danes, and reaches their Camp by Break of Day. Ocra and Oduno by the King's Command attack the Danish Camp in two Places at once, and after a long and sharp Combate, Ocra and Oduno are repulsed. Alfred leads on his Men and, after an obstinate Fight, forces their Lines and puts them to Flight. While Alfred's Troops plunder'd the Camp, Ocra seized the royal Pavilion and took in it King Gunter's Queen, and Elsitha his Daughter. Alfred gives them their Liberty, and sends them back to the King with great Respect. King Gunter and his Court astonish'd at this generous Action of Alfred, which they attribute to the Power of his Religion, resolve to make Peace and become Christians. Oratours are sent to King Alfred to propose Terms of Agreement, to which he consents. The Princes by Appointment meet at Cunetio, where Gunter and his Court are baptiz'd. The next Day the Terms of Peace agreed upon are solemnly ratified. That done, Alfred asks of Gunter Elsitha for his his Bride. Gunter and Elsitha consent, and the Nuptials are solemnized. The British Heroe, these great Wonders done, The Rebels vanquish'd, and Toledo won, Back with his Chiefs to Pampeluna came, Where the glad Tribes ador'd the Victor's Name. The King with eager Arms the Prince embrac'd, And on his Friend high Marks of Honour plac'd. Superiour Lords and Officers of State To praise his Valour on the Heroe wait. Silva the just, for Gratitude renown'd Address'd the Leader with Respect profound, While Tears of undissembled Joy apace From melting Eyes ran down his reverend Face. The crouding Vulgar to the Palace press, Applaud the Monarch and the Briton bless: The tuneful Bards the Heroe's Actions sing, And echoing Streets with Acclamations ring. During three Days of Triumph various Sorts Of celebrated Games and manly Sports Employ the active Youth, whose eager Eyes Impatient view and seize the tempting Prize: Some strain their Nerves, and Feet superiour show In the swift Race their Rivals to out go, And the proud Garland, envy'd Emblem, gain, That crowns th' elated Victor of the Plain. On Coursers some with sprightly Air advance, And with surprizing Skill project the Lance. These at the Mark the glitt'ring Jav'ling fling, Those send the Arrow from th' impulsive String, While buckled some demand the Wrestler's Ring. The Pyrenean wounded Forrests lend Their sever'd Limbs, and Neighbour Woodlands send Their verdant Branches, which in Piles arise, And kindled bear the Triumph to the Skies: These solemn Fires the wond'ring Heav'ns adorn With Light unborrow'd and terrestrial Morn, While they aspiring ruddy Flame display, Reveal the Hills and spread nocturnal Day. Setts of fam'd Bells, sublime in Turrets hung, Manag'd by Master-Hands melodious rung, And by their Peals and Changes sweet of Sound Publish'd the Conquest to the Lands around: While Fountains play'd high Jetts of gen'rous Wine, The Purple Honours of Navarra's Vine, The crouding Youth their Bowls capacious crown'd, And loyal Shouts from Tow'r to Tow'r rebound. The Court by Day regal'd at princely Feasts With all delicious Foods unnumber'd Guests, And spent in various Joys the chearful Nights, Balls, Games, and Masks, and theatral Delights; While Tubes, that Speech from Foreign Breath acquire, With the sweet Lute, the Viol, and the Lyre, That vocal grow by soft Vibration, join'd In well imagin'd Consorts, and combin'd With tunefnl Voices, ravishing to hear, Regal'd with heav'nly Harmony the Ear. And now the solemn Space of Time expir'd Destin'd to publick Joy, the King requir'd Just Silva, and the British Prince besought To speak the Method they the wisest thought Against th' imprison'd Rebels to proceed, If he should punish or forgive the Deed. He saidâAnd Albion's Heroe thus reply'd: 'Tis hard on this great Subject to decide; Prudential Virtue, which is wont to use The middle Way, must here that Way refuse; Either Extream you may successful chuse. You the severest Rigour may employ, And thus Rebellion's baneful Root destroy, Which should you think an Act of Prudence, none Can as unjust arraign Fortunio's Throne; Your's are the Rebels Lives and not their own. But should the King this rig'rous Justice show, Do it with Speed, at one effectual Blow: For by Delay the People's Minds relent, Who soon their Heats and stormy Passion vent; And Justice, when they feel no Rage nor Fear, Will Lust of Blood and cruel Wrath appear: They'll now for Mercy to th' Offender cry, Nor will they bear to see the Traytors die, Whose Heads, so great for Vengeance was their Thirst, They had with Rapture seen struck off at first: And hence crown'd Heads, that stedfast have decreed Against proud Rebels vig'rous to proceed, Observe, so I conceive, a wholsome Rule, Who give the People's Rage no Time to cool. And as in Justice Kings should not be slow, But should at once their utmost Rigour show, So then to all they shou'd indulgent grow; Who by Degrees to just Reflection brought, Will soon forget, what once they cruel thought. If you severe chastise this high Offence, You should disable all, that you incense; Your wise Precaution should extend so far, As not to leave them Pow'r to wage new War; Else they will vengeful rise again in Arms, And still disturb your Realm with fresh Alarms: Often, as all recorded Annals tell, Conspirators set free again rebell, And while unpunish'd more their Prince defame, Indulgence Fear, and Mercy Weakness name. Rebellion's Witch-like Charms the Senses bind, Harden the Heart and stupify the Mind: Whence Traytors spar'd the Mercy seldom own, But, more embolden'd, more insult the Throne: Oaths, Pardons, Dangers can't their Progress bar, They lay new Plots and meditate new War. Hence prudent Kings oft in their just Defence Disarm these Sons of Blood and Violence, And to prevent a new seditious Storm, Disable Foes they never can reform. Th' Extream upon the adverse Side that brings, In such a State, Security to Kings Is that they grant an Amnesty with Speed To all, that all from Fear of suff'ring freed, And won by such a gen'rous Act of Grace, May the disloyal Cause no more embrace, But in Obedience to a Monarch live, Able to strike, but willing to forgive. Mercy so unconstrain'd, so undeserv'd May change their Hearts, who from their Duty swerv'd: Thus poison'd Clans may factious Maxims quit, Renounce their Guides and to their Prince submit. But should a Monarch in the Middle go, And not strict Justice, nor great Mercy show; Should he, when Rebels who presum'd to wield Perfidious Arms are vanquish'd in the Field, Suspend their Sentence long, and not decree Either to punish or to set them free; Mercy and Justice he would much debase, This would its Terrour lose and that its Grace. Hence should you penal Pow'r by Halves employ, And not acquit the Pris'ners, nor destroy, Deal Justice Peace-meal out, and now and then Cut off some friendless, low, unmony'd Men, While all of Titles, opulent and great By purchas'd Intercessions Law defeat; While favour'd Courtiers Pardons now retail, And set up Lands and Lives at publick Sale; Stung with Resentment Subjects will behold Not only Places, but Rebellion sold, And conscious of the Springs from whence they rise, These weak inglorious Methods must despise; And such a Temper they'll interpret Fear, And Clemency will Impotence appear: Rebels embolden'd will refuse to yield, Recover Hopes, and take again the Field. Would then Fortunio unmolested live, Push Home your Blow at first, or all forgive. He said, and Silva thus the King address'd: Prince Alfred fully has my Soul express'd. Let not the King false Moderation know, But great Compassion or great Rigour show: Most to the first my Sentiments incline, For tho' like Mercy Justice is divine, Yet when a Monarch soft Indulgence finds Likely to calm exasperated Minds, Feuds and contagious Ferments to appease, Ill Humours sooth and heal the State's Disease, He should with Balms the angry Sore asswage, Which often Med'cines violent enrage: And Mercy more securely may be shown Since Velez Faction's Head and Prop is gone. Each Method publick Troubles may remove, But I the mild before the sharp approve, From This you'll rule by Fear, from That by Love. He ceas'dâAnd Alfred prais'd what Silva said; And by this wise Advice the Monarch led, Gracious proclaim'd a gen'ral Amnesty, Forgave their Guilt and set the Pris'ners free. This Mercy undeserv'd, to Rebels shown, The People eas'd, and fix'd the Monarch's Throne. Now Osmor, Ocra, Lords from Albion sent, And Alred, Guithun's Brother, with Intent To find the Prince, to Pampeluna came, Directed thither by the Heroe's Fame. He at the Sight of British Friends express'd Great Marks of Joy, whom Alred thus address'd. When weak by wasting Pains Atulpho grown Chang'd for a heav'nly his terrestrial Throne, Prince Ethelbal, who had before rebell'd Against the King, by trait'rous Chiefs upheld, And shar'd his potent Realm, was now the sole And uncontested Sov'reign of the Whole: But his Dominions he not long possest, Thrown by his fiery Courser on his Breast, And by the fatal Bruise of Life bereft, To Ethelred, the King his Empire left: He sways the Scepter now of Albion's Isle, That Scandinavia's Powr's of late embroil With fresh Descents, the suff'ring Land devour By new Brigades, that numberless they pour On Britain's Coast: Our King by Foes oppress'd, His Ruin threaten'd, and his Realm distress'd, Entreats, brave Prince, that you without Delay Would to your Native Land direct your Way, To guard his Throne by your unrivall'd Arms, And from your Country drive the Cimbrian Swarms. He ceas'dâThe Prince mourn'd Albion's State involv'd In Woe, and soon to reach her Shore resolv'd: And now departing from Fortunio's Court Takes solemn Leave, and hastens to the Port Of Flaviobriga, in whose ample Bay His Ships, so Alfred bade, at Anchor lay. And now the solar Orb's prevailing Light Unveil'd th' Horizon and dispell'd the Night, While gloomy Shades before his Glory flew, And humid Meteors and raw Fogs withdrew. The Britons soon embark, and plough the Main, While o'er the bounding Waves they sail from Spain: On Aquitanian Seas they steady steer, Till the white Cliffs on Albion's Shore appear: At Isca's Mouth, where strong Danmonian Swains Feed woolly Flocks, or till the fertile Plains, The Prince debark'd, and wing'd with Zeal and Love To gain the Monarch's Camp impatient strove. The Fame of Alfred's Landing swiftly spread Thro' all the Region in the Natives bred New Life and Joy, their Weapons all prepare, And quit for glorious Labour rural Care. With martial Noise the Vales and Mountains ring, While to the Field bold Youth with Ardour spring: Towns catch from Towns contagious War's Alarms, And every Street resounds withâArms, to Arms! The Cry is, Alfred, Alfred, wise and brave Is safe arriv'd, his Sword will Albion save, Defend our Altars, quell the Cimbrian Host, And drive the Robbers from our harrass'd Coast. The Prince mean Time the high Pavilion gains Where agonizing Ethelred in Pains Severe, cold Sweats, and Throws convulsive lay, Peirc'd by a Spear the antecedent Day In his right Side, while resolute in Fight He push'd the Dane, and put his Troops to Flight; And ere returning Morn new Light display'd, His Eyes were clos'd with everlasting Shade. Alfred for all great princely Virtues fam'd, Who at his Country's Pow'r and Greatness aim'd, And strove to raise her Riches and Renown, With loud Applause succeeds to Albion's Crown. While he some Days amidst his Army staid, Till he had decent fun'ral Honours paid To an heroick Royal Brother due, A prudent King to his high Office true, Undoubted Tidings to the Monarch came, That his West-Saxons fir'd with martial Flame Had taken Arms, and speedy Marches made To reach his Cohorts, and the Dane invade. The King encamp'd near a wide Forrest lay, Since Sellwood call'd, and on the following Day Ere the bright Sun had spread meridian Light His Friends with waving Ensigns march'd in Sight, And soon, while Shouts and Acclamations ring Around the echoing Skies, they join'd the King. Some from th' extended Promontory came, That took from mighty Hercules its Name, Who landing here on fair Britannia's Isle, So Fame reports, by wonder-working Toil Destroy'd a monst'rous fierce gigantick Race Of Bulk enormous, and obscene of Face, Who cloath'd their hideous Limbs with Skins of Beasts, And held in cavern'd Rocks their savage Feasts: Horn'd-hides with grisly Terrour crown'd their Head, Their Cup a hollow Oak, a Grove their Bed: Long they infested every Hill and Wood, On Rapine liv'd and rioted in Blood. They came, who dwelt on the sweet River's Bank Since call'd Tonrigia, or the Tava drank; These in their vig'rous Hands bright Lances bore, Strong Bows of Yew a-cross their Shoulders wore, While feather'd Deaths their ample Quivers store. From Moridunum on the Southern Main They rush to Arms, and muster on the Plain; Join'd by the Youth which from the Current came That from th' amphibious Otter takes its Name: With these combin'd the military Pow'rs That left high Isca's celebrated Tow'rs, Or dwelt along Isaca's verdant Side Which thro' the smiling Vale rolls down her Tide. Urg'd by brave Zeal their Country to restore Ardent they left the Totonesian Shore, And spreading Dert whose silver Streams bestow Gay Pride and genial Treasures as they flow. These arm'd with two edg'd Swords &amp; polish'd Shields Fill'd, as they march'd, with growing War the Fields. Some left the fertile Land that Tamer laves, And the fam'd Town wash'd by the Ocean's Waves, Which on that River's Mouth exalted stands, Protects the Port, and Sea and Land commands. Here CorinÃ¦us, (Rumour so prevail'd,) The mighty Giant Gogmagog assail'd Vast and twelve Cubits high, a dreadful Sight; And grasp'd &amp; caught him up with wond'rous Might, Then headlong from the rocky Mountain hurl'd Th' enormous Heap amidst the watry World! Drown'd and emerging he disturbs the Main, And frights the Monsters that its Gulphs contain, While, like a floating Island scarcely mov'd By Tempests, he whole Seas before him shov'd. Bold Troops advance from all the Towns that stood On either Side Tamara's spreading Flood, Whose flow'ry Banks and intervening Tide The West Danmonian from the East divide. Intrepid Warriours leave the Northern Shore Where wild Hibernian Seas indignant roar, And march from all th' Abodes dispers'd around With People, Rivers, and rich Acres crown'd. Others in Arms the Southern Region quit, Which interposing Seas from Gallia split: Here oft the Land uncommon Freedom takes, And to the Main Excursions frequent makes, While rocky Points protended wedge their Way, And oft extruded Promontories stay The rushing Billows this and that Way tost, Whence the unequal, rough, indented Coast A Kind of Hornwork seems by Nature fram'd, Whence the whole Region is Cornubia nam'd. Rumours of War thro' Hills and Vales resound, And enter 'midst the Delver's Caves profound: These subterranean People of the Soil Catch warlike Heat, and ask more noble Toil, And while their Breasts impulsive Ardour feel, They leave their Tinny Oar for warlike Steel. In Whorlbats, manly Games, and wrestling taught, Active and strong, at Home they Honour sought, Abroad with Spears and Battle-Axes fought. Renown'd Oduno these to Alfred led, And shone in polish'd Armour at their Head. Rous'd by th' Alarm brave Durotrigian Lords To vindicate their Nation draw their Swords; While Hope of Conquest Thirst of Glory feeds, All snatch their Weapons and demand their Steeds; For Helms and Shields run to their lofty Halls, And of their martial Honours strip the Walls: Then emicant in Arms they take the Field, Brandish the Spear, and the broad Faulchion wield: Tenants and Vassals wing'd with Courage swarm Around their Leaders, and Freeholders warm With equal Fire from Countries near and far Flock to the Rendezvous, and ask the War, Fair Vendogladia's military Force, Septona's Foot and Durnovaria's Horse. Illustrious Esca these to Alfred brought, Who various bloody Fields with Triumph fought. Some Trinobantes of distinguish'd Fame, Regnian and Belgian Chiefs to Alfred came, And Attrebatian Lords to martial Toil Innur'd, and valiant Knights from Vecta's Isle. As when sweet Isis, that with worthy Pride Salutes the Seats of Science with her Tide, Advances smiling thro' the flow'ry Meads, And wanton Volumes to the Ocean leads, Her liquid Arms new confluent Brooks enclose And adventitious Rivers, as she flows, Till, grown a noble Flood, her Depths can bear Sublime Augusta's Fleets of Trade and War: So Alfred's Army swell'd, who now with Speed To storm the Scandinavian Camp decreed. Mean Time the Dane his Forts and Castles drain'd Where strong Brigades in Garrison remain'd, Assur'd his Conquests, and his Pow'r maintain'd; These Cohorts vastly Gunter's Host augment, All vers'd in Combate and on Slaughter bent: Against the Foe he wise Provisions made, Resolv'd to guard his Ground and not invade; Then pitch'd his Camp on Edingtona's Plain, Determin'd there with Vigour to sustain Th' invading War; a thick and spacious Wood Assur'd his Left, his Right a fordless Flood, And in the Front high Lines and Bullwarks stood. Now Alfred bright in Arms the Saxon heads, And to the Dane th' embattled Cohorts leads: They high in Air with Shouts their Weapon's wield, And by swift Marches gain th' extended Field, Where the augmented Cimbrian Host they found Strongly encamp'd on advantagious Ground. Then dress'd Musician like, and in his Hand His Harp, that could with charming Sounds command The ravish'd Soul, the Heroe took his Way, And reach'd the hostile Camp at Fall of Day; Where ent'ring bold he struck his vocal Strings, No sweeter Musick chears voluptuous Kings. So David, fair JudÃ¦a's potent Lord, Was for his Lyre renown'd, as well as Sword; With This He savage Beasts and Giants kill'd, Phrensy with That compos'd and Fury still'd. With Art like Alfred's so, if Fame be true, To touch the Harp admir'd Amphion knew, And Orpheus with such Strains the Forrest drew. His Melody the list'ning Warrious hear, Feel the soft Rapture vib'rate in the Ear, And thought some Stranger from the Seats above Was sent their Hope and Valour to improve. He sung the Praises of their warlike Bands, And high extoll'd the Chiefs of great Commands, Whose martial Deeds were fam'd in distant Lands. How Inguar, Hubba, Haldan, mighty Lords Of Scandinavia by their matchless Swords Had often glorious Laurels gain'd in Fight, And put their boldest Foes to shameful Flight: How unfatigu'd with Hardships, Care, and Pain, And scorning all the Terrours of the Main, Their potent Navies with successful Toil Landed their Troops, and conquer'd Albion's Isle. Two Days and Nights the royal Harper staid, And unsuspected vigilant survey'd The Posture of the Camp, intent to know, Where best his Warriours might attack the Foe: Now, ere the Skies were conscious of the Day, He undiscover'd hasty took his Way Back to his Troops, and gave Command with Speed To bring his Armour and his gen'rous Steed. Then forward sprung, and brandishing his Lance Bade his embattled Squadrons bold advance With silent Pace, and not excite Alarms By the shrill Trumpet or the Noise of Arms. 'Twas Night, the Image of the Court of Death, Waves ceas'd to rage, &amp; Winds had spent their Breath: Tir'd Swains relieve the Day's by nightly Sweat, And Hounds their Chaces in their Dreams repeat: The Groves and Garden-Trees cold Dew-drops weep, And Flow'rs in native Silks enfolded sleep; The sparkling Stars in azure Turrets shine, While all Things favour'd Alfred's high Design. The Prince of Darkness from a Mountain's Height, Looking around with sharp seraphick Sight, Discern'd the Britons in the silent Night, Ready to pour their Vengeance on the Foe, While unsuspicious of th' intended Blow. Then to himself with Fury in his Eyes He saidâShall Albion's hateful Prince surprize The Scandinavian Leaders, and employ Base Arts and Arms clandestine to destroy Their Cohorts? No, I'll interpose Delay; I'll give them Time to draw forth in Array The Battle, and rebuke bold Alfred's Pride, Not Fraud, but Valour shall the Field decide. He saidâAnd call'd the Ministers of Hell Of vulgar Rank, malicious Fiends, that dwell Among the Reeks and Meteors of the Air, Smiths of the Sky, that Thunder-Bolts prepare In floating Forges, and industrious form The livid Light'ning, and contrive the Storm; And thus bespoke them.âDemons, fly in Haste, And with raw Steams and Vapours overcast Th' aerial Gulph contiguous to the Land, The Demons swift obey'd his dread Command. Soon Mists and Vapours form a gloomy Fog, And with their hazy Stores th' Horizon clog, That from the Marshes, Ponds, and Rivers rise, Whence lazy Damps oppress th' inferiour Skies. Alfred had reach'd the Foe by Break of Day, But stood compell'd the Combate to delay Till the bright Orb should with prevailing Light Disperse the Mists and chace this second Night. Now did the Sun the hov'ring Reeks dispell, Black to the Sight and noxious to the Smell, When to the Camp the King advanc'd, and found The Dane well posted to defend his Ground: For while the Air grew thick he took th' Alarm, And bade, to guard their Lines, his Cohorts arm. Yet did the King intrepid Courage show Determin'd to assault the num'rous Foe; But first in solemn Pray'r did Heav'n invoke To aid his Arms; then thus his Men bespoke. Long have the Cimbrians Albion's Spoils enjoy'd, Pillag'd our Cities, merciless destroy'd Our fruitful Land, by Murder fill'd the Graves, Deflowr'd our Maids, and took our Men for Slaves; Vengeance severe! yet in the Balance laid Against our heavy Guilt it's far outweigh'd. Heav'n has chastis'd our Crimes, now in its Turn The cruel Cimbrian shall his Suff'rings mourn: So heav'nly Visions Alfred have foretold, Be then couragious and in Battle bold. Trust your great Maker; trust your righteous Cause; The Land is yours,âthey violate the Laws Of Heav'n and Earth, while from their naked Home Spoilers and robbing Vagabonds they roam. Shall they our sacred Altars overturn, And in the Dust the Christian's Glory spurn? Shall Pagan Demon-Gods, by us abhorr'd, (Forbid it Heav'n) be thro' the Isle ador'd? Shall their unhallow'd Domes in Albion rise, Pollute the Kingdom, and affront the Skies? Shall they their Idols, Wood and Marble, raise In every solemn House of Pray'r and Praise; Drive thence the Vot'ry, that our Creed believes, And turn each Temple to a Den of Thieves? Shall here enthron'd a Cimbrian Robber sit? Shall gen'rous Britons servilely submit To an insulting barb'rous Lord their Neck, Aw'd to Obedience at a Pirate's Beck? Shall these Abodes, these Streams and fertile Plains, These Pastures fill a vagrant Nation's Veins? Beggars that left their Home in Want of Bread, Shall they, Britannia, by thy Spoils be fed? Will not West-Saxons for their Church contend, Their Laws and Lands and Families defend? Avenge, brave Men, the Blood the Dane has spilt, Reduce his Arrogance, chastise his Guilt, And force him to repass the boist'rous Waves, To dwell again in Snows, and skulk in Rocks &amp; Caves. He saidâAnd Ocra, so the King commands, And fam'd Oduno with two chosen Bands March from the Army, and advance in Form By two Attacks the lofty Lines to storm. Alred brave Ocra joins, two faithful Friends, And Esca great Oduno's Fate attends. Ere the bright Orb had his first Stages run, The Signal giv'n, the Chiefs th' Assault begun. Intrepid Ocra with his Troops assail'd The high rais'd Lines and long in Fight prevail'd; With such Success his missive Weapons flew, That he bold Segar and Ammonda slew; This did in Skill, and that in Strength excell, One by the Spear, one by the Jav'lin fell. Then his projected glitt'ring Deaths destroy'd Fam'd Esketel, that Wealth immense enjoy'd, And mighty Ilden long in Arms employ'd: This in his Belly felt the fatal Wound, Then sunk and struck with ringing Arms the Ground; That by the Steel which enter'd deep his Side, Dropt on the Field, and in a Moment dy'd. Then Regenol of Borno's martial Race, Sivard and Vmbo, who their Lineage trace From Cimbrian Monarchs, by the Heroe slain Britannia's Fields with royal Blood distain. Then waving in the Air his flaming Blade On the high Lines he great Destruction made: Elfus and Edrick he depriv'd of Breath, Peirc'd Arpen's Breast, and to the Courts of Death Sent Rabanol, who left the Northern Shores Where the Norwegian boist'rous Ocean roars, And with the Dane invaded Albion's Isle, Urg'd by rapacious Hopes of wealthy Spoil; Now with the Cimbrians slain he mingled lies, And by the Briton's Arms with Honour dies. Gufrid advancing Ocra's Force withstood, And dauntless made a while the Battle good; Till wounded deep and smear'd with flowing Gore He stagger'd, fell, and groan'd, and spoke no more: He, long insulted by a haughty Wife, To 'scape the Torments of domestick Strife Fearless expos'd to nobler War his Life: By mortal Wounds now did the Warriour bleed, By worthy Combate from inglorious freed. Then Heuladin, a bold Finlandian Lord, Who in the Danish Cause had drawn his Sword, His hardy Cohorts to the Battle brought, And to repell the Heroe bravely fought: But by superiour Arms the Goth had dy'd, Had not Gotaro swift Relief supply'd; He rushing to the War with fresh Brigades In desp'rate Rage the British Troops invades. Great Ocra then in doubtful Conflict strove, He now retir'd, and now prevailing drove From their high Lines the fluctuating Foe, While Vict'ry unresolv'd flew to and fro. So when two adverse Storms the Skies embroil Near Persia's Gulph or Madagascar's Isle, Warring with balanc'd Pow'r by Turns they yield, By Turns are Masters of th' aerial Field: The flying Clouds they this and that Way drive, And long with equal Force in Combate strive. Still Forces new hard on the Saxon prest, While Foot to Foot they fought, and Breast to Breast. When faithful Alred saw the valiant Chief By Foes encompass'd, swift he brought Relief By fresh Brigades the Conflict to maintain, And fill'd the ample Ditches with the Slain. He slew bold Vlfrid at his Cohort's Head, And laid brave Anlafe on the Rampart dead. Cubert and Eltha, who his Arms withstood, Fell by his Sword, and welter'd in their Blood. Then did Elfuda to the Fight advance, Vast was his Size, and pond'rous was his Lance, Which at the Saxon he with Vigour threw, But o'er his Head the erring Vengeance flew: Then rushing on they came to handy Blows, When on the Lines a noble Combate rose; Alternate Strokes ring from their suff'ring Shields, While neither overcomes, nor either yields. Alred at length enrag'd, to end the Fight, Stretcht all his Nerves, and call'd up all his Might For one decisive Blow, his lifted Sword Descended on the mighty Cimbrian Lord With such a dreadful Sway, that thro' the Crest It cut his Head; the issuing Blood confest The grievous Wound; he stunn'd, and dizzy reel'd, Till Friends ran in and bore him from the Field. Then did the Chief, his Faulchion in his Hand, Drive back the Danes, and made a noble Stand Till Ocra, who renew'd Assaults in vain, Prest with fresh Foes, and weak by Numbers slain, His fruitless Efforts now no more repeats, But with his Warriours from the Fight retreats. Back from the Lines then to the Host he came, And, tho' not Vict'ry, won egregious Fame. Mean Time Oduno with his stout Brigade Approach'd the Lines and a brave Onset made: To clear his Way his missive Arms he hurl'd, Which sent Haddingus to th' unpractis'd World, Rother and Helga, both of Scandia's Isle, Who oft came Victors Home with wealthy Spoil And Trophies won, this on the Northern Shoar Kill'd a huge Bear, and that a savage Boar. The Chief press'd on and num'rous Warrious slew, The rest dismay'd and seiz'd with Terrour flew From his destructive Sword, till he at last, His Passage freed, the high Entrenchment past. Many brave Cimbrians striving to repell Th' advancing Heroe by his Weapons fell. Then Osmund, dreaded for prodigious Might And Arms enormous, undertook the Fight, Who left the polar Snows, and frozen Shore Where gag'd with Ice the Billows ceas'd to roar: Religion's sacred Altars he contemn'd, Mock'd future Vengeance, and the Gods blasphem'd: The Christian's Founder impious he defy'd, And on his Sword, renouncing Heav'n, rely'd: With horrid Execrations on he came, And cry'd, Oduno's Fate shall spread my Fame. Now at the Chief the Pagan's Jav'lin flew, It struck, but pass'd not half the Buckler thro'. Oduno then with Force athletick flung His pointed Ash, th' impetuous Weapon sung Along the Air, and, had not here the Foe Inclin'd his Body to elude the Blow, It might have pierc'd the Cimbrian's polish'd Crest, Or buried lain triumphant in his Breast. Great Osmund three more missive Weapons cast, And three Oduno, but in vain; at last They close the War; each other's Life assail, And with vast Rage contending to prevail, With rival Courage and with rival Might And equal Strokes they long protract the Fight, Tho' not a vulgar Chief could ever give Once such a Stroke, or one such Stroke outlive. Now rushing in, the Saxon Heroe clasp'd The Scandian Champion, and with Vigour grasp'd Him in a close Danmonian Hug, and held (Alcides so 'tis said AntÃ¦us quell'd) His Foe on high, then cast him on the Ground, And gave him with his Spear a mortal Wound. Welt'ring in Gore he gasp'd and strove for Breath, And mutt'ring Curses star'd and rav'd in Death: Thus the Contemner of Religion fell Sent for Conviction to the School of Hell. Now high-born Hubba raging o'er the Plain Advanc'd th' invading Champion to sustain. He from the Banks of Eyder came, renown'd For wise Designs, and oft with Conquest crown'd In bloody Wars, but more the Cimbrian Lord Rely'd on magick Pow'rs, than on his Sword: He, quilted in his Vest, a potent Store Of Spells and Charms and little Idols wore: But chiefly he regarded, when he fought, Th' auspicious Crow, that by his Sisters wrought And broider'd on his Banner flew in Air, And made the Pagan Potentate his Care; So Superstition taught; hence undismay'd While guarded by this secret mystick Aid He march'd the Saxon Conqu'rour to engage, Invok'd his sacred Bird, &amp; fought with desp'rate Rage. Dauntless the Saxon Chief the Charge sustain'd, And, to encrease his Honour newly gain'd, He now his Jav'lins, now his Sword employ'd, While Hopes of Conquest Hubba yet enjoy'd, And in his Turn dealt noble Strokes; at length The Saxon Lord, collected in his Strength, Hurl'd a huge Iron Ball against the Foe, Which struck his Breast with such a dreadful Blow, As beat out thence his unreturning Breath, He sunk, and felt the cold Approach of Death: While thus the Saxon Chief the Dane assail'd, Nothing his necromantick Arts avail'd, Nothing his magick Crow, nor could one Spell The great Danmonian's pond'rous Death repell. And now Oduno soon a glorious Field Had gain'd, and made the Cimbrian Cohorts yield, Had not the Troops that drove back Ocra join'd With Hungar's, who to help their Friends combin'd, Reviv'd the Fight, and pour'd a furious Storm On Warriours weaken'd, tho' with Valour warm. Oduno yet maintain'd the Ground he won, Aided by Esca, who had Wonders done Cover'd with Blood, and by his fatal Blade Had many Orphans and young Widows made: But by augmented Foes out-number'd far Oduno wisely now declin'd the War; Retreating he discover'd on the Plain Succours by Osmor led his Onset to sustain; And join'd with these he turn'd, the Fight renew'd, And soon repell'd the Cimbrians, that pursu'd. Back to the War with double Rage he flew, And mounting up broke thick Battallions through, Then on the Lines stood gather'd in his Might Dispensing Death, and long maintain'd the Fight. Clad in refulgent Arms in Suecia wrought The Cimbrian Monarch full of Fury brought New Forces up his fighting Troops to aid, And midst the Foe profuse Destruction made: Yet still the Saxon Leaders kept the Ground They gain'd, not vanquish'd nor with Conquest crown'd. Alfred, his Jav'lin brandish'd in his Hand, With Ocra first in subaltern Command, Now springing to the Lines his Weapon cast, Which thro' Aquino's Shield and Breast-Plate past, Then to his Heart its Way impetuous sped, And drank his Vitals at their Fountain-Head: The Heroe fell, and gasping out his Breath, Shiver'd, and sunk in the cold Arms of Death. Then his long glitt'ring Spear with mighty Force The Briton threw, which in its rapid Course Peirc'd valiant Froger's Scarf, and silver Belt; Its Point the Warriour in his Stomach felt; Who groaning, and with Pain outragious torn Swift by his Friends was from the Battle born. Then Alfred up the Lines intrepid rose, And, by his flaming Sword's repeated Blows, Cuts down the Cohorts that his Arms oppose. Gumarus, who by unrestrain'd Expence And loose Delights had wasted Wealth immense, And swoln with flatt'ring Hopes that by the Sword His broken Fortunes might be soon restor'd, With dauntless Courage Albion's Prince assail'd, But not his Strength and temper'd Arms avail'd, Nor invocated Idols; on the Lines Transfixt by Alfred's Spear, he Life resigns. Suno of boundless Hoards of Gold possest, Collected while the Spoiler did infest The Hyperborean and the British Main With warlike Ships equipt for lawless Gain, Beheld the King, and fearless of the Sight Hardy advanc'd, and undertook the Fight. A while they strove, till Alfred's Faulchion broke Thro' Suno's Helm, and with the dreadful Stroke Cut thro' the high Apartments of the Brain, The Champion fell and mingled with the Slain; Thus Suno's Blood was by the Briton spilt, And War by Land aveng'd pyratick Guilt. Hasna the Lord that rul'd the Rugian Isle, Mighty in Strength and vers'd in martial Toil, Withstood the King, but by his Faulchion fell, And Shades eternal on his Eye-lids dwell. Elmunda then a wise and valiant Chief, Who ardent sprung to bring his Friends Relief, By Alfred wounded lay of Life bereft, And a fair Wife with sev'n young Orphans left. He slew Golara, Borcan, Alvared, And Hubbalar in Northern Cimbria bred, And many Champions more and Warriours bold, Whose Names in past Records were ne'er enroll'd: Thus did the King destroy his Foes around, And with a bloody Harvest spread the Ground. His Men by Alfred's great Example fir'd, And with heroick Fortitude inspir'd, With so much Vigour martial Strokes repeat, As made the Cimbrians from their Lines retreat. The conquering Cohorts, Alfred at their Head, Pursu'd the Foes, who from their Fury fled, And left their Camp, that with abundant Spoil Enrich'd the Chiefs, and crown'd the Souldier's Toil. Ocra, who Gunter's high Pavilion seiz'd, There his fair Queen and Daughter sound, and pleas'd With his propitious Fate was joy'd to bring The high-born Captives to the Victor-King. Much was the Queen for princely Virtues fam'd, And every Tongue Elsitha's Worth proclaim'd; The joyous Spring of Life and opening Morn Of rosy Youth her lovely Cheeks adorn, While Dignity with heav'nly Sweetness join'd, And modest Airs with royal Blood combin'd, All Charms and Beauties to the fair impart That draw Esteem and captivate the Heart: From such a Mixture in a Seraph's Face Results the Bloom celestial, and the Grace Ineffable, that crown th' immortal Race. Genius and Wit, Perception swift and clear, And all the chief Endowments that appear In Souls the most exalted and refin'd, Form'd for so bright a Frame an equal Mind. Works of the Needle, Books, domestick Care, And fit Diversions all her Minutes share; Nor did the Fair in Games and Feasts rejoice, Nor made voluptuous Scenes of Mirth her Choice; Yet these, lest too great Rigour should offend, To grace the Court, at Times she would attend: Courteous to all, and tho' still guarded, free, She kept, when most she stoop'd, her high Degree: Chearful, not vain; reserv'd, but not morose; Open, but still in Things important close, She did to all obliging Speech address, And strove to solace Virtue in Distress. The Queen to Alfred brought, first Silence broke, And to the King these Words pathetick spoke: See, prostrate we before great Alfred lie, Sollicit Grace and for Protection cry; From your illustrious Clemency we crave Our Lives, at least our dearer Honour save. Decline what vulgar Conqu'rours think their Right, And, like the Gods, with Mercy soften Might. On your fam'd Virtue stedfast we rely; Rather than suffer Shame we beg to die. Then, while a Flood of Tears fell down her Face, The royal Captive did his Feet embrace, While fair Elsitha with her Head inclin'd Fetch'd frequent Sighs, and weeping stood behind. She saidâAnd Alfred gracious from the Ground Rais'd up the beauteous Queen in Sorrow drown'd: And thus he spoke,âIllustrious Princess, here You stay secure, and need no Insult fear On Life or Honour, cease to mourn your Fate, See, I release you from your Captive State: To Christ's celestial Scheme of Truth resign'd, I thus obey the Laws that he enjoin'd. He saidâAnd gave to Ocra's faithful Hand Th' important Trust, and by his high Command Bound him to guard and give the royal Pair To Gunter with Respect and tender Care. So Scipio, who heroick Aims pursu'd, And gain'd a Name from Africk Realms subdu'd. Thro' all the loud-applauding World renown'd, With more illustrious Elogies was crown'd For not invading his fair Captive's Charms, Than those the Heroe gain'd by matchless Arms. Enrich'd with princely Gifts, bright Gemms &amp; Gold And Silks embroider'd, glorious to behold, The royal Danes their great Deliverer bless'd, His Goodness prais'd and grateful Minds express'd, Then took their Leave, and were by Ocra led Safe to their King, who from the Battle fled With the collected Remnants of his Host To Ascola a strong well guarded Post. The Scandinavian Prince with Joy receiv'd Elsitha and his Queen, of whom bereav'd He more his Loss and hapless Fate bewail'd, Than that the Foe had o'er his Arms prevail'd. Alfred Elsitha's Beauty much admir'd, And found a secret Flame his Breast inspir'd: His Thoughts her Form divine, her radiant Eyes, Mild as the milky Lustre of the Skies, Her Features, Air, and graceful Mien approve, And Liking quickly ripens into Love: And had Elsitha Christian Truth profess'd, To gain the Fair he had his Suit address'd; And just had been his Choice, for faithful Fame Strove thro' the Isle her Merit to proclaim. This gen'rous Action of a Foe imprest The royal Dane, and kindled in his Breast To Alfred ardent Love; he much admir'd His Valour, much the Virtues that inspir'd His noble Mind and just Renown acquir'd. Ocra with rich Rewards to Alfred's Tent Joyful return'd, to whom the Cimbrian sent A Cap of Velvet from Hesperia's Shore, Splendid with Figures form'd of Guinea's Oar: The Sides turn'd up with Furrs of glossy Jet With various Gemms of Worth immense were set; And a broad Sword, the Haft an Agate made, An Amethyst the Pommel, and the Blade Fine temper'd Steel with Figures bold inwrought By curious Art, was from Iberia brought. This Sword, that Hugar from Borasso won Was left to Gunter his heroick Son, Whose faithful Edge unnumber'd Warriours felt, Besides a Crimson Scarf and silver Belt. This generous Deed from Aims unworthy free, This unexampled Mark of Piety, And Virtue shining with a heavn'ly Blaze, Did in the Cimbrian Court such Wonder raise, That Christian Precepts justly they admire Which such celestial Energy inspire, And Principles sublime, by which the Mind From vile and vicious Habits is refin'd. Nor had the King with serious Thought revolv'd Th' important Subject long, ere he resolv'd His Pagan Idols to renounce, efface Their Shrines and Domes, and Alfred's Faith embrace: His Queen and Chiefs, by the same Springs inclin'd, Soon to espouse the Christian Creed combin'd. Alfred mean Time, who Conquest had in view Ardent advanc'd his Ensigns, to renew Heroick Toil, and by swift Progress lay Encamp'd on Birga's Fields at Close of Day. Soon as th' emerging Sun with Lustre mild Gilded the Clouds, and on the Mountains smil'd, Three of his greatest Lords by Gunter sent Were led by Alfred's Captains to his Tent; To whom with low Obeisance they addrest; Then Inguinar superiour to the rest Broke Silence and their Message thus express'd. Great Prince, by us our Sov'reign lets you know He is no longer pleas'd to be your Foe: Your Valour much, but more your gen'rous Deed, When you his captive Queen and Daughter freed, And sent them back with princely Gifts, has wrought Strong on his Mind &amp; chang'd the Monarch's Thought: He must, he says, believe your Faith divine, That can the Heart to such great Acts incline. Hence his old Rites determin'd to forsake, And to the World sincere Profession make Of Christian Faith, he your Assistance prays, And asks to be baptiz'd without Delays. For Amity he yields, that you command In Peace the Middle and the Western Land: That to the Northern Region he'll retire, And not to Pow'r of more Extent aspire: For these Dominions he will Homage pay, And should new Swarms their Ensigns here display, He will no Succours to th' Invaders send, But will the Isle against their Arms defend. He saidâThe King reply'dâThe Offers made Shall be with Care and Thought delib'rate weigh'd. The Danes withdrewâTo whom the following Day Thus Alfred spokeâYour King has found the Way To FriendshipâI his Articles approve To settle Peace, and hostile Heats remove: If then your Monarch and his Court with Speed Will to Cunetio on the Downs proceed, There to our pure Religion if inclin'd, Baptiz'd, as by our Founder is enjoyn'd, He to our sacred State may Entrance find. I'll haste to lead him to the Christian Fold, And 'midst Believers see the King enroll'd: Then may a League form'd on his Scheme commence For Friendship and reciprocal Defence. He ceas'dâThe Envoys to th' expecting King The Briton's Answer to their Message bring: Gunter rejoyc'd, and bade his Men prepare For his intended March with speedy Care. The Sun's bright Orb three Times had rose and set, When the two Monarchs at Cunetio met. The royal Pair embracing here express Their Joy, and mutual Amity profess. Again, the Queen and fair Elsitha pay Their grateful Thanks, and Baptism earnest pray: Alfred transporting Pleasure felt to find In the fair Danes so well dispos'd a Mind. Guithun, chief Pontiff of Britannia nam'd Soon as th' illustrious Prince was King proclaim'd, With Christian Love and heav'nly Zeal inspir'd, (So Alfred bade and so the Dane desir'd,) Th' important Objects of Belief explain'd Reveal'd from Heav'n, by Miracles unfeign'd Asserted, and in sure Records contain'd. He the Redeemer's wond'rous Scheme display'd By boundless Love and perfect Wisdom laid; And then expounded with instructive Light The blest Design of Baptism's fed'ral Rite And venerable Test, which they that take Of Christian Faith solemn Profession make. The Prelate then the Cimbrian Converts told They by this sacred Badge would be enroll'd 'Midst Combatants, who, by their conqu'ring Head The mighty Captain of Salvation, led To glorious War, in Arms divine repell The World's Allurements and th' Assaults of Hell. That their celestial Founder's Laws enjoin This mystick Seal, this sacramental Sign, His Kingdom to distinguish, and enclose His Church from unbelieving Tribes, that those, Who his Dominion mediatorial own, By this baptismal Symbol might be known. The Monarchs with their Train in princely State Enter Cunetio's lofty Temple-Gate, Where Guithun Chief of Albion's sacred Lights Baptiz'd the Danes with instituted Rites, And many Lords besides the royal House Now at the Font reveal'd Belief espouse. This Ceremony past, the Temple rung With loud confed'rate Songs devoutly sung By Danes and Britons, who in rapt'rous Strains Prais'd the great Being, that immortal reigns Enthron'd sublime in Empyrean Skies, And the vast World, that stretch'd beneath him lies, Holds as an Atom in his boundless Hand, While the bright Orbs impell'd by his Command Run their known Rounds, nor in their Progress stay Oppress'd with Toil, nor deviate from their Way. The joyful Quire in like extatick Lays Rais'd high as Heav'n the bless'd Redeemer's Praise: They sung the wond'rous Labours of his Life, And boundless Value of his dying Strife; Then magnify'd the Energy divine That made the Grave the Lord of Life resign, Who springing from the Grasp of Death did rise By self-recov'ring Vigour to the Skies; Where high enthron'd for his he interceeds, And to remove their Guilt his Merit pleads: Nor did they in their Hymns neglect to join The Praises of the Comforter divine. The Baptism finish'd and loud Anthems sung, Sweet sounding Bells in lofty Turrets hung Unvaried Peals or tuneful Changes rung. Now did the Kings move from the Temple Gate 'Midst shouting Throngs in slow majestick State To the high Palace, fair Cunetio's Pride, Where Princes oft to breathe sweet Air reside. Next Day the royal Pair to Peace inclin'd With fed'ral Rites a strict Alliance sign'd; And by the God, whom Christian Realms adore, To keep their solemn League religious swore; By which the Northern Districts of the Land Were all submitted to the Dane's Command, While he a Kingdom did dependent own, And annual Homage vow'd to Alfred's Throne; That if the Dane should issuless Decease, His Realms to Alfred might revert in Peace: Britannia's middle Regions, and the West To Alfred's Sov'reign Pow'r subjected rest. The Treaty finish'd by the Trumpet's Sound Thro' either Army and the Towns around, Heralds and parti-colour'd Kings at Arms Proclaim'd the Peace and sunk fierce War's Alarms. The Kings embrac'd; and to his new Ally Now did Britannia's Monarch thus apply; That we in nearer Bonds may yet be ty'd I ask Elsitha for my beauteous Bride, Whose lovely Form and Qualities divine To my admiring Eyes unrivall'd shine: When first the Fair sunk in Distress I view'd, Her Charms in Part my yielding Heart subdu'd; But since she owns the Christian's sacred Creed, And in her Breast receives the heav'nly Seed Of Truth divine, my Passion I approve, And hope I feed not unsuccessful Love. The Cimbrian joy'd with Alfred's Choice comply'd, Nor by Elsitha was his Suit deny'd: For Alfred's Deeds before the royal Maid So rich a Bloom of Virtues had display'd, That when the captive Princess he releast She felt a Pow'r unknown invade her Breast, And not displeas'd with her soft Wound, in Part Let in the gentle Victor to her Heart. The Nuptials solemniz'd, and all the Days Destin'd to pompous Triumphs, Feasts, and Plays, To Justs, and publick Games, at lengh expir'd, Gunter enrich'd with princely Gifts retir'd, And took to fair Eboracum the Road, The City chosen for his Chief Abode. And now attended with a noble Train The British Monarch from Cunetio's Plain Did to the Banks of spreading Thames retreat, And made Augusta his imperial Seat. FINIS.</field>
