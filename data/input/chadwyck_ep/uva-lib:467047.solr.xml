      <field name="fulltext">I. POEMS IN MANY LANDS Second Series THE UNKNOWN MADONNA. I know that picture's meaning,—the unknown, Called School of Umbria; it stands alone; Those prayerful fingers never worked to fame,— A master's hand, though silence keeps his name. But for the meaning, gaze awhile and plain The thought he worked in warms to life again: Love made those features living, such a face Smiled once,—on whom? Say in a lofty place He could not climb to,—in those eyes' blue deeps The reverence of unreached ideals keeps The human memory, not a face of dreams, And coldly beautiful, but one that seems Caught in the likeness that a lover's eyes Devoutly worshipped to idealize; And since creation is akin to prayer He made that face God's Mother, and set her there Among the lilies by the hill-side town. And then the child, a flower-face to crown The human love-dream, little hands entwined Round one surrendered finger, to my mind Just such close watching, tenderness expressed As those who miss it learn to look for best. Perugian, say we,—look, the lilies lean Against the mountain, dips the vale between, Yonder's Assisi on the nearer ridge, And that's the gorge that hides the giant bridge Joining Spoleto, and beyond, away Hill-crests like waves in purple to midday. That was his thought, to make his art her shrine, And lift her human up to the divine; So smiles Madonna, so evermore sits she Against the Umbrian blue mountain sea. Why do I think so? Why, because if I Could paint just one such picture ere I die, Make one thought everlasting, I would choose His theme, the Mother and the Child, and use A face as sweet as this was; in the Child Reflect its beauty, only undefiled Of pain and sorrow and knowledge, and would set Both in a garden that is lilied yet With beds her own hands tended, and enclose All in a girdle of the hills she chose Of earth's fair homes to dwell in, keeping so The tender fragrance of dead years ago. I would not change these few square feet for halls Of Ghirlandajo, for the magic walls Of this your Cambio,—I would rather keep My silent record of his nameless sleep, Dream back his story through the long blank years— Believe those lilies once were dewed with tears. Perugia. DANTE'S GRAVE. There is an awe, I know not whence or why, About the graves where sleep the mighty dead, There is an instinct guides our feet to track The path they travelled; these have led me here. This is Ravenna, in the midnight hour Of windless silence, the blank windows stare Like eyes that time has blinded through the night From ruins and half-ruins, and my step Startles the haunted echoes. It is here! Vast in the shadows, San Francesco looms Against the quick Italian stars, one lamp Confirms the cloister's gloom, a willow tree Droops to a grill of iron, and within Dark cypress clusters: this is Dante's grave! Far from the Tuscan mountains and the vale Loved with a patriot's passion, here he died, Unpardoned, unforgiving, unsubdued. Oh great sad constant soul that stood for God In a wild world of discord, though you climbed Steep stairs of alien palaces, and knew How salt the bread of exiles, failing friends And misconceived ideals,—where are they Who sat in the high places! Time has made Thy scorn their only monument, and dimmed Each lesser lustre round thy lonely star! Not all unrecompensed on earth! For thine The faith which ventures the ideal love, The crown which envy cannot clutch, the faith Which feels how vainly venomed arrows strike The flawless armour of a pure intent; And the ideal love leaned down from heaven To win thee from false idols, and reveal Tier after tier to the last murky deep The doom that passes pardon, urged thee mount Hard ridge by ridge the penitential hill, Through the terrestrial Eden, to attain The mysteries of the rose of Paradise. Oh stern of tenure to thy purpose high! Oh, hard to love, compelling to revere! For all the wanderings of thy exile feet Be earth's remorse our reverence and our hope! For hope is child of wisdom, and despair The bastard of half-knowledge. O'er this grave The soft quick stars have climbed and set again, The rose he loved has flushed the morning east, The snows along the back of Apennine Have blanched and thawed through five long hundred years, And man has marched not vainly the steep road Proclaimed by priests and poets. Soon, aye now, We almost need thy grisly hell no more! We have outgrown the visionary doom That waits on sin's hereafter, Love not Fear Urges our progress up the purging hill, Where man must answer for his fellow man: And new ideals have set heaven so high We miss thy clearer vision, nor complain! Our years are dim with struggle, as were thine, But lit with gleams of promise, where at times The herald watchers on the heights discern Far peaks of that first Eden which is spread Nearest the confines of the light of God. Ah, lonely city of the marshy mead, Left lonelier by the ever-ebbing sea, Keep thou thy guest and guard his sacred sleep: The poet's refuge, be the poet's grave! Well rests he here, dead reed of deathless song, Where silence feeds on echoes of mute names, Shrouded in memories, famous and forlorn! Ravenna. MARCH. Such blue of sky, so palely fair, Such glow of earth, such lucid air! Such purple on the mountain lines, Such deep new verdure in the pines! The live light strikes the broken towers, The crocus bulbs burst into flowers, The sap strikes up the black vine stock, And the lizard wakes in the splintered rock, The wheat's young green peeps through the sod, And the heart is touched with a thought of God; The very silence seems to sing, It must be spring, it must be spring! OCTOBER. A fitful wind about the eaves, That sways the creaking door; The shadows of the falling leaves Flit past me on the floor. The autumn skies are clear above, But silent is their song; Oh, spirit of the changeless love, Keep back my autumn long! In vain with gold the forest weaves Its sylvan greenness o'er; The shadows of the falling leaves Flit past me on the floor. It means the world is growing old, It means no birds to sing; Oh, not for all the autumn's gold Would I forego my spring! THE GONDOLA. We do not speak but hearken To softly plashing oars, We watch the wide way darken Between the lighted shores, While sable-hulled and silver-prowed Slide past the phantom boats, And near and far, now low, now loud A drifting music floats: They only have one song to sing, The song of youth and love and spring. And where St. George's Island Looms o'er the dark lagoon, Slow through the rifts in sky-land Sails up the golden moon; Now I can see your shadowy hair, And read your dreaming eyes, So sweet, almost the old despair, The dirge of memory dies; Oh, only teach me to forget, And I may learn to love you yet! THE WANDERER'S SONG. Day is dead, and blent in shadow Lies the ridge that crowns his tomb, Mists are rising from the meadow, And the woods are massed in gloom. Homeward bells of lowing cattle Sound along the village street, And the gossips' shrilling prattle, And the children's running feet. Cool the fountain water splashes, And the lights show one by one, While the first star faintly flashes In the gold wake of the sun. Silent groups return from reaping With a reverence past the shrine— Hold you God in His good keeping, Give you lighter hearts than mine! Out beyond the hills that bound you Deeds are done and thoughts are thought— Such a battle rages round you, But it vexes you in naught: Evening air a-scent with clover, And the peat-smoke softly curled Up the dark hill-side and over— This is all your little world! Have ye other lives to travel, Quiet dwellers in the trees, Deeper problems to unravel Than the darkest drift of these? Loftier aims in other ages, Wider orbits, keener fears? Rest you now! for labour's wage is Dreamless sleep and quick-dried tears. Here men change not, men desire not, Here men wander not away; Here they fail not who aspire not, Here are still content to pray, Such a rest from all the riot! Fairest valley that thou art, This contagion of thy quiet Spreads its twillight on my heart. Now the mountains lie in trances, All the forests sway in dreams, And the moon with silver lances Strikes the ever-waking streams: Waking stream, we race together, Rush and swirl and even flow, Breasting crags or skirting heather To a sea we neither know. Your swift eddies envy surely, As they near the rocky leap, Yonder lake that lies so purely Hardly rippled in its sleep; So, half-envious, I too linger, Pace the village to and fro, While yon peak gleams like a finger Pointing skyward through the snow; Then away—and no returning! Whirls the eddy down the gorge, Where, night through, the fires are burning, And the sparks fly from the forge. On, till these blue stars are setting, And the dawn unrobes the sky! Such an Eden of forgetting I would ask for when I die! Tyrol. AVE MARIA. Ave Maria! Day declines, Grows the peace of the evening star, Shadows rise on the mountain lines,— Wide the heaven and God so far! How should He stoop to the human sin! Mother and human take me in! Thou hast suffered, and thou canst see, Ave Maria, Ave Marie! Ave Maria! At end of day Rings thy peal on the evening air, Calls the world to its homeward way, Stays the heart in a pause of prayer; Ave Maria, by storm or star, The thought of the wanderer turns from far To the shrine of his haven,—Light of the Sea! Ave Maria, Ave Marie! Ave Maria! Years roll by, Thy dominion shall endure, All who make for the hard and high, All the chivalrous brave and pure, Kneel in heart at an inward shrine, Built for a woman, and therefore thine, For we lift our love to the light of thee, Ave Maria, Ave Marie! CHRISTMAS EVE. A GERMAN STUDY. Little mother, why must you go! The children play by the white bed-side, The world is merry for Christmas-tide, What would you do in the falling snow! They sleep by now in the ember-glow, Hushed to dream in a child's delight, For wonders happen on Christmas night: Little mother, why must you go! The still flakes fall and the night grows late, Oh slender figure and small wet feet, Where do you haste through the lamplit street, And out and away by the fortress gate? It's drear and chill where the dear lie dead! Yet light enough with the snow to see: But what would you do with that Christmas tree, At the tiny mound that is baby's bed? A Christmas tree, with its tinsel gold!— Oh, how should I not have a thought for thee When the children sleep in their dream of glee, Poor little grave but a twelvemonth old! Little mother, your heart is brave, You kiss the cross in the drifted snow, Kneel for a moment, rise and go, And leave your tree by the tiny grave. While the living slept by the warm fireside, And the snows fell white on your Christmas toy, I think that its angel wept for joy, Because you remembered the one that died. TOURGUÉNEFF. Oh watcher of the night, what cheer to see? A fruitless fret and fume of uncontent, A world of shadows wandering aimlessly, A weary purpose and a heart long spent; A hand of iron reaching everywhere, And over-clouded skies where no stars shine, A flock without a shepherd, and despair Gazing across the darkness for a sign; A crowd of preachers without faith or creed, And here and there, to break the monotone, The passing wonder of a golden deed— A sacrifice, unrecompensed, unknown. And is that all? Not quite; beside the bier Where youth lies self-devoted, far and faint Above the world's scorn crying “fool,” I hear Another voice that seems to answer “saint.” VENICE. SAN SERVOLO. The isles are purpled in the haze, We leave the dark canals and pass To open water ways, The noon sky burns like burnished brass, The yellow waters glare: The Euganéan mountains seem Suspended high in air, A mystic world of island rocks From some enchanted dream. The noon chime breaks from distant clocks Faint o'er the hot lagoon, The yellow sails hang lifelessly, The earth lies in a swoon; We hardly know if sky or sea Is round us where we float, There seems no life in all the world But in our sable boat. The very oar-weeds do not sway, The seagull's wings are furled, And on the shallows still as they It floats beneath the spell. In yonder ancient island pile Each window lights a cell; A great red wall shuts in the isle And dips in the lagoon, And blank and shadowless it stares Towards the burning noon. Great God, a sudden shriek that scares The seagull to its wings! A brutish shriek, but not of pain, That rings and rings and rings, And once again, and yet again, And then the silence falls Lonely and weird and sad.— A world of life in yonder walls, And all those men are mad! TO F. M. C. Strange is it not, old friend, that you who sit Bowered in quiet, four garden walls your world, With books and love and silence,—sails fast furled And grounded keel that hardly now will quit Its stormless haven,—you sit there and write Of human passions, of the fateful fight, Of all men suffer, dream and do, Denounce the false and glorify the true! While I the wanderer, I whose journey lies In stormy passages of life and sound, I with the world's throb ever beating round, Here, in that very stress and storm of cries Make songs of birds, weave lyric wreaths of flowers, Recall the spring's joy and the moonlit hours, And know that children's ways are more to me Than all you write of and I have to see. THE SONG'S SPELL. Where did you learn that music?—for it drew My dreaming back down autumn paths of years, Touched chords long silent, and forgotten tears, Recalled dim valleys where dead violets grew, Soothed me with twilight, as it were it knew The very secret of my heart, and sighed For sympathy, and when at last it died It seemed as if my soul were singing too. Where did you learn that music, to allure Thoughts long in silence and submission pent? Oh such was Blondel's at the dungeon doors, So rang the song of captive troubadour, Echoed along the moonlit battlement On far-off legend-haunted shores. TO A CHILD. Nay, child, awhile go back to play, Be happy to be young! The world grows wise before its day, Leaves half the songs unsung. And bloomless are its garden trees, Round all the ways are set Forget-me-nots of memories And pansies of regret. The meadows where your daisies are Will yield more dear delight Than watching for the wandering star We may but watch at night. I would not clip your wilful wing, Nor cloud your morning sky, Nor draw across your path of spring The shadow of a sigh. For Time will bring the bloomless tree, The roseless garden plot, And on the bed of memory The sad forget-me-not. ASSISI. AN INTRODUCTION. Di quella costa là dov' ella frange Più sua rattezza nacque al mondo un Sole. —Par. XI. The gates are shut, for here in the mountain nest They keep the old-world custom, and the ring Of battled ramparts holds the little town Safe in its stern embracing,—twilight walls With windows staring at the April stars, Grey fronts of hoary palaces upreared Like ocean cliffs against the sky.—Deep down A few lights twinkle in the shadowy vale That broadens into darkness, and beyond The misty hills, and still the hills beyond. Near by a fountain splashes on and on, Intensifying silence, now and then Some hound bays on the mellow air, the bells Ring the reluctant hours, but all things else Slumber profoundly, and the ancient streets Are dark and solemn as befits a shrine. Lovely in light of morning, touched with peace In the gold glow of noontide, loveliest still In the moon-radiant sleep, this mountain land Of all earth's lands speaks nearest to the heart, Touches a chord of memory, and relinks Time's broken sequence. Here once lived a man Who took God's literal word in earnest, chose The child's interpretation, and forsook, While a fierce world about him warred and wailed, The path of glory for the thorny way Worn by the feet of one in Galilee A thousand long forgetful years before. Tread softly here, for here his feet were bruised, Here he was mocked and gibed at, here he gave His very body to redeem men's souls In that rough age of symbol, till a light Burned in this mountain fortress that still shines Round his forsaken altar, and shall shine When altars fall and litanies are dumb. This was a man like you and I who went With song and laughter down the vale of youth, With keen delight in living, in no wise Secured from passion or withheld from pride, The earthly dream had lured him:—suddenly He heard the voice speaks once to every man, And hearing did not stifle it; he saw The visible contrast, the old woe of earth That ever cries for righting, he conceived There was another kingdom made for souls, Where love not wisdom watches at the door, That whoso enters, enters as a child,— And lived out his ideal; such white lives God takes for mouthpiece here on earth, secure His word shall pass untainted. Therefore he Who loved the whole life-throbbing earth so well, With such quick sympathy the very birds Endured his gentle presence, the wild things Fled not his kindly greeting, flung aside The lute of young romances and stripped off The sword and helmet, girt about his youth The sackcloth of repentance, and went forth A homeless pilgrim to the heart of man. And lovely now across the sundering years, Touched with the glamour of earth's morning time, It rings, the ancient story, how they went His new disciples on their helpful ways About these Umbrian valleys, and fulfilled The literal record of the life of one That had not anywhere to lay his head. But ah, the cloister's dedicated cells Are tenantless, and silent is the shrine. The fortress towers moulder on their hills, And pilgrims seek not his deserted fane: The world is so much wiser! Only when, As now, the moon is on the land, then ghosts Flit round these shadowy portals, and the night Rolls back long tides of centuries. So I,— Waking an old-time echo by the walls That Giotto decked and Simone, long since When priest and painter first went hand in hand, And still the memory of saints was dear,— I, standing in the shadow and looking down To where the lowlier tower of St. Claire Leans woman's wise to the high rock of his,— The last and lonely pilgrim, made my vow Some day to tell his story and enshrine The “saintly brother” in an English song. OH DEEM ME NOT FORGETFUL! TO M.T. Oh deem me not forgetful, though I love The sunny pastures and the land of vine, And golden walls where in the niche above Some shadowy saint smiles through the broken shrine! For when the angel of the evening star Looks down the track of sunset, and there fall The twilight dreams, and through the hush afar Some church-bell rings good-will at eve to all, Oft in the twilight of my dream I pass To a quiet spot in England where the trees Seem giant shadows on the misted grass, And silence turns the key of memories; And there are times it makes me mad to see Those red lights twinkle, hear the horse's tread Along the old familiar road, and be Where all the mirth and all the love are dead. NORTH AND SOUTH. How I remember one day of all That Tuscan spring-tide's carnival! How I remember one eve when we Leaned over the edge of Fiésole, While all the plain lay in opal mist Low under the ridges of amethyst, When the gates of heaven seemed open wide As the sun went under the mountain's side, And over the sky in a flood-wave rolled The tide of the glory of molten gold. Do you remember the chime that fell From the tinkling roof of the cloister bell? Do you remember the tales we told Of the dwellers there in the days of old, While the reapers climbed from the slopes below With scythes that flashed in the after-glow, With the laughing eyes and the hill-born grace, And the tale of ages in their face? Do you remember how marble-white The towers lay in the May moonlight, How the first few fire-flies came and went, And just to live was a deep content? How warm and sweet was the evening air, As if all the garden of spring grew there! How we seemed to have reached to a joy at last That was not in the morrow and not in the past, And only a word might have held it fast! We were hardly lovers, yet more than friends, If one begins where the other ends: And was it the dream, the time, the place, Or was it the magic of your sweet face? For I can remember your least word said,— When the blood is young and the lips are red, Oh why should the dead not bury their dead! Here, leagues away, are the plains that roll To the Baltic shore and the silent Pole; Dark belts of forest shut in the day Low under the dome of the autumn grey, With a gleam of red on the rifting lines Over the edge where day declines: The leaves decay and the chestnuts fall, The chill Norse shadow is over all! And yet, and yet, were you only here, I might not fret for the waning year, Nor hunger so for the valley wide, For the starry blue and the steep hill-side, And the tower of Arno dim-descried. Pomerania, '87. TO FLORENCE. For the unveiling of the new façade, May, 1887. IMPROMPTU. The strife is dead, the ramparts' ring Is a flowery path for feet of spring, The old gates never close, And well the Lily City rests Between the hills' divided crests Through which her Arno flows. The strife is dead, the broad-flagged street Recoils no more from armoured feet, The towers are all laid low, For White and Black have long been one, As sunset after setting sun, And friend was laid with foe. A people's love returns to thee, Who first of cities learned to be A nation and a name, Who never bowed the head to fate, And bore the harvest of thy great To gratitude and fame! For Rome is like some mighty wraith Reincarnate by a nation's faith, But Florence did not die! She earned her peace in ample tears, And rests upon the stormless years With passion long put by. But still the spirit is not spent That bade the Ghibelline relent To save her from her doom; The love that softened Dante's eye For Farinata's agony, Fire-tortured in his tomb: The spirit which in the day of need Was greater than the merchant greed, And armed her for the fray, When stern Ferruccio hacked and hewed And died among his hero brood On Gavinana's day. The spirit which decreed the shrine, That old Arnolfo's dim design First planned for Florence free, That Donatello decked and gemmed, And Brunellescho diademmed, And Giotto, ah, but he! He set the marble marvel high Against the limpid Tuscan sky, The tower of all the towers, Her glory and her sentinel With chime and ave warding well Our Lady of the Flowers. And now glad bells ring out to-day, Ring far down Arno vale away, To the mountain citadels: Let Prato's to Pistoia call, And let Pistoia's battle-wall Re-echo with the bells! For where the old ambition failed The love of after years availed Worked with as prayerful hands, And Florence has her shrine at last, The shrine she purposed, unsurpassed In all the alien lands: Fair delicate spiral shafts and rose Of window tracing and repose Of saints in solemn row, And wealth of jewels set in gold, And fretted carvings manifold Of marble white as snow! Oh, hero dead, from your happy isle I think that you look back and smile The exile heart returns, For never dead were held more dear, And pilgrim nations reverence here Your cenotaphs and urns. Her work of years is done to-day, And watching in their long array Her mighty sons rejoice: The last upon the scroll of Fate, De Fabris, from the silent gate Leans back to hear her voice. Dear city of the hills, well done! Smile on beneath the fair May sun In calm and conscious pride, The fairest city built of hands In recollection's loveliest lands By silver Arno's side! A nation's effort is their prayer, And thine shall rise on this spring air Beyond the blue above, Worthy of Florence, Florence free, Worthy of Florence, Italy, And worthy all men's love. Florence, 1887. TO G. L. G. Less often now the rolling years Will time our feet together, And seldom now the old voice cheers The march of wintry weather. But friendship knit in other days, When hope was first aspiring, Will hardly quit the travelled ways For fancy's new desiring. Hope beckoned round the world, dear lad, And light we followed after, And knew the grave and loved the glad, And shared men's tears and laughter. We set our young ideals high, And if the aim out-soared us, Still not to trust was not to try, And something shall reward us: And what we found too hard to reach, And what we failed in winning, May wait us somewhere yet to teach The end is the beginning. We made mistakes in youth, my lad, But they will not out-live us, The worst we did was none so bad— The world may well forgive us! Long be it ere we two depart! Time make our friendship mellow! I never loved a truer heart, Nor wished a better fellow. “BRUMA RECURRIT INERS.” The clouds roll down the forest And almost meet the plain, One snowy peak, the hoarest, O'er-tops the clouds again, The brooks are babbling louder, The stream is swelling prouder, For many days of rain. The belfry in the village Rings with a muffled chime, The rooks swoop o'er the tillage, You see it's autumn time; All things are dead or dying, And thoughts are turned to sighing, And will not run in rhyme. A MAZURKA OF CHOPIN. Play on, play on, the low lights wane, So, softly, softly play! For your fingers draw me away, away, And dreamland comes again. Are you 'ware of little stars in a pale sky! Play on,—and say no word!— There is scarce the breath of a midnight sigh? Or a frond of the fern-wood stirred; Was there ever a night so magic still? Only a low moon is peeping Through the sway of aspens sleeping, And a ripple frets the rushes in the rill: Are you 'ware of little feet upon the grass, Tripping, rushing, Hardly brushing Any feather of the frailest as they pass, Of a twinkle of infinite tiny feet, And the kissing of tiny kisses,— Never was night so summer-sweet Blessed of the moon as this is! They are threading in endless mazes, Lifting the drowsy fold Of the lids of the sleeping daisies For a look at the eyes of gold: Gossamer robes of delicate weft Cling light on the moony air, Rosy petals, a pardoned theft, Are bound on the streaming hair;— Now round and round in a linking chain, Round and round and away again! They are dancing to the ripple they are moving, Keeping time to the glinting of the star; There's a glowworm for the lantern of their loving, And wedding bells are ringing where the heather-flowers are. Can you hear their little voices, you would hear If it were not for the ripple on the stream: Still, for a moment,—now you hear, Marvellous sweetly, clear and near, Under that silver beam, Songs of a wonder-world, my dear, World of a wonder-dream. [There never were such radiant noons] There never were such radiant noons, Such roses, such fair weather, Such nightingales, such mellow moons, As while we were together! But now the suns are poor and pale, The cloudy twilight closes, The mists have choked the nightingale, The blight has killed the roses. SONG. You were the only, only one, A long long while, You were the spring, and all my sun Was in your smile! You were the cloudless crescent moon In quiet skies, The stars that clouded o'er so soon Were your two eyes. Oh why so much and not the whole! Was mine the wrong? You were the music and the soul Of all my song! New suns may dawn for you, for me, Stars rise again, But you have been what none can be, My spring refrain. TO ARISTARCHUS. Dear critic with the many tongues, again I come for judgment with my book of rhymes; And since, dear critic, you do oft complain This youth has graceful fancies and clear chimes, But ever in some soft and southern strain He sets his key to soothe us, let him strive Henceforth with sterner weapons; I would say, Dear critic, not ten talents, no, nor five But one poor talent fell to me who play For whoso listeth on what keys I may. And for the selfs song?—well, I would reply That words so issuing to the world belong, To tear in its ribald humour, and if I At times have written all myself in song, I'll keep my own soul's secret, none shall buy My life-blood in the public place to test: He knows who sings what songs are of the heart, How the highest notes touch silence; for the rest, I would not hawk my sorrows in the mart, Nor sell my soul to win the crown of art. And last, dear critic, what you most impugn, These scanty handfuls for a season's yield,— May I not answer, still the year's at June, And other fruits have ripened in my field? But now and then the lute is set atune, And fancy beckons in the wandering time; And so, dear critic, let us part good friends, And as of old be patient with my rhyme. Farewell, to other lands my journey wends, But we may meet again before it ends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. IN EXCELSIS. A SONG OF EVOLUTION. IN EXCELSIS. “Das Einige, woran mir gelegen sein kann, is der Fortgang der Vernunft und Sittlichkeit im Reiche der vernünftigen Wesen.” “Und hiermit geht die ewige Welt heller vor mir auf, und das Grundgesetz ihrer Ordnung steht klar vor dem Auge meines Geistes.” —Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Thou hast passed the fatal border, Thine eyes are open wide, And where is that new order Should be on the other side? The light of old is darkened, And knowledge dwells with pain, Now fain wouldst thou have hearkened And turned thee back again. So many foes assail thee,— The sorrow of weak will, The sorrow of friends that fail thee, The hurt of loving still, The sorrow of idle speaking, The sorrow of waning youth, The sorrow of fruitless seeking, The bitterness of Truth. Thou askest, who will show thee The thing that thou shouldst do, And a hollow deep below thee Returns thine answer, who! The devious ways are doubled, Thou hast doubted what is sin, Thou art tired and dark and troubled, And disconsolate within. Lonely soul, I know thy trial, thy denial once was bitterness to me, No white ray of hope hath found thee, All grows dim and fleeting round thee,— Only forms of things external Shadowed o'er a dream diurnal, Only what the self discerneth still returneth for its essence but to thee. Thou hast passed through wildering mazes, Thinking in and thinking in, Till the spirit reels and dazes And the moving sands begin. Thou has peered behind the curtain, And the clouds seem ever shifting, And the ocean darkly drifting, And there is no sure nor certain In the shadow world thou knowest Save the grave to which thou goest. Now no more thy choice is free Face what thou hast willed to see, Set thy nerve to face the gloom, Bold to wrestle with thy doom, Clear away all tangent issues, Memory's weft of phantom tissues, Fling the dear child dream apart, Hug the haggard truth to heart! Either less than nothing worth Fruitless pangs for bitter birth, Aimless wanderings over earth, Any dawn of any day To the life whose goalless course is But the sport of unknown forces In a worse than wanton play; Or there must be something other, oh, my brother, than our nothingness to find, Something still besought for blessing though confessing we are lost and spirit-blind, Something dimly apprehended Not in thee begun or ended, Vainly questioned by thy “whence” Out of thine experience, Something that in all our being though unseeing yet as surely we pursue, Which thy will accepts unproving, ever moving, ever fruitful, therefore true. What is this which whispering saith All thy being is by faith, Only faith and nowise knowing Moves thy coming and thy going, Faith in power to perform, Faith that effort is not vain, Good that was will be again, Faith that peace will follow storm: Surely thou canst find evolving From begetting and dissolving, Something ever growing, gaining, Through the transient remaining, Not alone that sea's unchanging ever-ranging monotoning rhyme, But on every tide's returning Surely dawns to thy discerning, Something of the waves upcasting That confirms the everlasting As a shore for ever forming through the storming of the ocean drift of time. In the tale of ages hoarded, Witness is of this recorded, Wrongs that were and passed away, Night that was where now is day, Human needs that struck in blindness Answered back in human kindness, Harvests reaped in latter years Richer for long rain of tears; This across the dark sea's drifting marks the lifting of the cloudy veil and far As we cry our no surrender, dawns the splendour of Hope's solitary star. Ah, but Hope, I think thou sayest, Beams on havens, smiles to peace! Where is Hope, oh, thou that prayest, When the whirlwinds find release, When the blind force wakes to raven, And the shaken hills fall down, And the ocean whelms the haven, And the puny prayers drown! Thou hast deemed the sowing wasted Where the harvest fell untasted! Years of labour unrewarded Love's surrenders unrecorded, All the pains that none may tell Spent to do one small thing well! Then the sudden storm arises Big with passionate reprises, Sweeps away what lives have striven, dearly given in their sacrifice of joy, And the wave of life is stricken And the generations sicken, Or the mountains burst asunder, or the thunder bellows earthward to destroy, Silence drowns the human cries, Mocked and vain the effort dies. Oh, but Faith shall overthrow Utmost evidence of woe, Seeing nature knows no treason To the evermore of reason, Nothing dies though all things alter, Only faith and courage falter. All these shocks of desolation Are but birth-pangs of creation, Last convulsions of the forces That ordained the stars their courses, Witness of a work not ended, love-befriended since the dawn of all began, Thwarting forces that dissever, God's denials of the never Ere earth settle down for ever, To the silence of completeness in its meetness for the excellence of man: Nature lives and life fulfils Those old laws which laid the hills, In her wildest-seeming mood Still benevolent and good. Through the ruin o'er the wrack Gems of life come throbbing back; Not by earth shall cease to live What was never earth's to give; Life more live shall be again, After death and human pain Man's eternity remain. Come with me and I will show thee, I who know thee, to the solitary place, Where the morning-lighted road is haply God is speaking plain and face to face, Far beyond the wildering city And the discord of its cries, Where our impotence of pity Draws a blindness on our eyes, Where is life for aye renewing all the ruin of the used and the outworn, Where you feel the conscious essence in quiescence as the flower-buds are born; Where the woodbird fearless launches On the wing he trusts to bear, Where the waving forest branches Stir an ever limpid air, Where the world's heart throbs its fountain Through the rent of granite hill, With the silence of the mountain And the small voice crying still. Too long our lives have lain at ease When simple joys have ceased to please! Consider all this singing mirth The eternal miracle of earth, Very death implying birth. A while agone and all was grey, A mist was wrapped about the day, The broken trees were black and torn, The sky all joyless and forlorn;— Then see how simply and how sure The mother nature works her cure, A sudden thrill, there runs a sign Through all the intricate design, A little sun, a little rain, And all the glory is again! No human logic shall destroy The mighty balance here for joy! Is the heart not beating stronger By one dread that dooms no longer? Joy thou hast if thou wilt use it, Hope if thou wilt not refuse it, Clearer yet from yonder summit Eyes shall see that overcome it. Up and on then! Higher, higher Climb the upland of desire, Till the valleys fade from wonder, Like a blue sea rolling under, And the lowlier echoes die Near the silence of the sky! Art thou dizzy at the steepness, and the deepness of the chasm under thee? At the light which strikes so purely, very surely, thou art dizzy to be free! Far beneath the mist shapes roll, Brows may face the glory fearless, Eyes are open wide and tearless, And self-conscious is the soul. Here where seldom since the world was Thought has travelled, feet have trod, Nature with a wealth as lavish Thrusts her marvels through the sod; In the silence, on the mountains Man has ever sought for God! Dimly under roll before thee All the ages of the earth,— Forms that cast the shadow story Of creation and of birth: Phantom shapes of first existence Looming hugely up through time, Shadows cast down wastes of distance From the mist-light of the prime; Giant strife of forces heaving Through a half-created day; Life surviving, strength retrieving What the torrent tore away; Stalks a gaunt and huge-limbed nation Hunger haunted, born to dearth, Compassed round with desolation Through bare hollows of the earth; Wandering races sternly striving With the infinite to do; And the good of them surviving For assertion of the true; Slowly mounting up from chaos Warring each upon his kind, To the first prayer,—“Lest they slay us,” From a spirit born but blind: Till the need of kindred uses Shed a fitful light on life, And they swore their savage truces To the demon of their strife: Then a little love like leaven Working upward, dimly seen, Till beneath the sun in heaven Tracts of barren earth grew green: And there rose the prophet speaker Pent in narrow grooves of race, Here and there an earnest seeker In his own appointed place: Sagas of the wandering nations, Idol carvers of the lake, Runes inscribed in mountain stations Which the haunting spirit spake; Truth begets her own recorder, In the drift and waste impearled, Slowly grew the dawn of order On the dark and waiting world. Slowly light on light ensued, Voices filled the Solitude. Light on light! for ever breaking with the waking to the consciousness of mind, But the love that needs must guide it not beside it yet, long lingering behind: Reason working blind and crudely, With the passion of the child, Strength and passion blending rudely For the taming of the wild; While some Titan marked his border, welding order, and on many a sanguine plain Fell the corn before the mowers that new sowers might replant the world again. Rose the hero's intercession 'Twixt the human and his doom, Heralding a new progression From a darker deep of gloom; Till the forms grow plainer nearer Memory known and dreamed and dearer All that human effort made for, Warred for, lived for, died for, prayed for, Prayed in all the names that slumber without number in the aves of the dead, Balder Ormuzd and Osiris Mark the height where man's desire is, And the temples on the mountains and the fountains and the oracles of dread; These and tides of Empire rolling for controlling savage hearts and wanton hands Till the wildest learned submission and tradition found the law that binds the lands. Fair creations pass before thee, Sunrise crowned and silver shod, Lit with all the halo glory Of man's morning dreams of God; Rose in Greece the star of beauty And the fables gathered form, Rome proclaimed the star of duty, And the stars outlive the storm; Slowly, spite the world's derision, Through the old pathetic strife, Gained and grew the stedfast vision Of the seers who taught us life; How they stand out grand and stoic more heroic than the heroes they dethroned, Drank their hemlock mute and smiling, unreviling, disregarded and disowned! Though the forms obscured in distance Rises one with mild insistance, O'er the hero's incompleteness O'er the code and o'er the creed, With a voice of passing sweetness Toned to touch the human need: One among loud wildering cries Still, with pity in his eyes, One despised and thereby purest One in bonds and thereby surest,— Man's defiance round him hurled, Standing lone against the world; And a sound like music thrilleth Yonder dark and misty vales, For a gentle answer stilleth All the world of human wails, Love is first! on love relying, Love the gain and life the loss, Crowned with sorrow, stabbed and dying On the shoulders of the cross! Love is first, though all agree not, Points the way, though all men see not; Though the road seem only steeper, depths the deeper, for the height we have to climb, Though mirages false bedizen our horizon, and a halo decks the prime, Though the aging eyes regretful Search the vanished vales of youth, And a memory half-forgetful Gilds the bitter lips of truth. Heed not thou man's false divining in the shining of thy true and stedfast star, Mark not thou the marsh light's luring the obscuring of the winded clouds that mar, Heed not all the groves of error, And the phantom thrones of terror, All the shadows of the sun, All the infinite undone! What is all the wrinkled past By the while the world shall last! These endure their little season, But the timeless eyes of Faith See the transience of treason And the impotence of death. Life shall pass and be reborn, Night as ever yield to morn, As surely as there dwells in thee The instinct of eternity; While through the changing chances, And by the conquered throes, The scope of life advances, The individual grows! Unbound by superstition, From forms and precepts free, His warrant in tradition, His law in Liberty! Say through chaos dawned a True, An Order, and a work to do: And clearer as each deed is dared The higher heights beyond are bared: Say 'twas sorrow and 'twas sin Human hearts were tempered in; War was but that peace ensue, Falsehood to assure the true, Lust for life to weary of, Hatred to constrain to love; Death is but the trance that brings Promise to the worm of wings! Much is needed to surrender Much of brave and dear and tender, False renowns that once were true While their work was yet to do, Liens of nation, ties of lands, Severed hearts and parted hands, All of chaos that survives Thwarting our unmoulded lives, All the idols time has shed Reverence over from the dead, Much beloved of yesterday, Worlds to do yet lie before us Swell the mighty triumph-chorus; Nothing good has passed away! Look not back with longing eyes, On before the gold age lies! By those heights we dare to dare, By the greatness of our prayer, Ever growing, loftier reaching To a royaller beseeching, By the olden woes washed painless, white and stainless in the tears of bitter price, By the strength of our assurance to endurance of the need of sacrifice, Not by dreaming but by using, Not by claiming but refusing, There shall dawn on eyes unsealing the revealing of a self that knows and grows, And the stream of thy devotion find the ocean where its meaning overflows. So take the thread that seemed so frail, Have faith to hope and never quail, For all the weary woes of earth And all the hollowness of mirth, Accept but this divine in man Believe I ought to means I can, And comprehend the perfect plan. Lift thee o'er thy “here” and “now,” Look beyond thine “I” and “thou,” Every effort points the next, And the way grows unperplexed To wider ranges, larger scope, All things possible to hope! Till thou feel the breath of morning shadow scorning, and on spirit wings unfurled Win the way to realms of wonder, Rolling starward with the thunder, Flashing earthwards with the lightning to the brightening the dark edges of the world, Till the vastness shall absorb thee, And the light of lights enorb thee, And the wings on which thou soarest Thou wilt need to shade thine eyes, For the radiance thou adorest, For the nearness of sunrise; Then thy strongest strength shall be In thine own humility, Wrapt into the holiest holy In thy worship vastly aisled, Bend the knee and whisper lowly “Our Father” with the child!</field>
