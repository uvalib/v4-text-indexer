      <field name="fulltext">?Non hic Te Carmine ficto Atque per ambages &amp; longa exorsa a tenebo, Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GENESIS. The CHAOS. Out of a rude and undigested mass The glorious Lamp of Heaven created was: No difference at the first 'twixt day and night, Until the Almighty said Let there be light: So after an Eclips his beams he darts, And rayes to the benighted world imparts. The CREATION. Herb yeilding seed, and fruit-tree her encrease, Was that with which God new-made Earth did bless. Sun, Moon, and Stars; with Fish, with Fowl and Beasts Our Infant world was stockt; but yet no guests; Stars unobserv'd, their constant laws fulfill'd, The Beasts untam'd, and Paradise untill'd. The PROTOPLAST. In Form, and Image, like His Own, the Lord Created man, by speaking but the word: With face erect, not to mind things below, Or whence he came, but whether he must go; The Prince, the Empire, and the Title good, Had but the man in Honour understood. The SECOND SELF. Adam has in exchange of's Rib, a Wife, The comfort of a solitary life; The breach clos'd up, how should that do amiss, Where God the Maker and Repairer is? Flesh of his Flesh is Eve, Bone of his Bone, So that the couple are not two, but one. The SERPENTS CRAFT. The Serpent, to make out he was a Devil, Prompt's Eve to what seem'd Good, intending Evil; His charm's so strong while he do's her entice That for an Apple Man lost Paradise: 'Twas well before since Adam, you dare eat The terms are hard for you and yours must sweat. The CURSE. Under a shady bough, with pensive thought, Asham'd to shew his head, lost Adams brought, His guilty hand now hide's his blushing face, But cannot hide his crime, or his disgrace: 'Tis sad for one to have been high before; And know that he can never be so more. The EJECTMENT. Turn'd out of pleasant and delightful Eden, For tasting of the fruit that was forbidden, He diggs into the bowels of the earth, And find's his grave whence he receiv'd his birth; Exile's a just reward for such as they, Who when they are exalted, disobey. The FRATRICIDE. When only Cain and Abel brothers were, And the whole world had not another pair, The firstlings of the flock acceptance gain, For which is inoffensive Abel slain; Worship by heaven approv'd made an offence; Such early Wars the Church and World commence. ABEL Revived in SETH. After an hundred years, and thirty gone, On Adam is bestow'd another son: Our chast Progenitors were youthful then, But now mans age is threescore years and ten: Bounty at first the thread of life did spin At length, but soon 'twas shorter cut by sin. The TRANSLATION. Enoch upright, and righteous in his waies, And one that wrought repentance all his daies, God will not have the common way to die, But be translated to Eternity: Those who their contemplations fix above, May seem to die, but rather do remove. NOAH ent'ring the ARK. While crying sins aloud to heaven did call, A floating Inundation sweep's off all; But Noah and his Family embark, And save themselves from danger in an Ark; Eight righteous Souls of all the rest survive, When others sink these keep mankind alive. The DELUGE. O how promiscuously the peccant World, Townes, Citties, Men, Beasts are together hurl'd! The lofty Oak, that out lives ten mens years, Will not serve turn when angry Heaven appear's: Yet mercy in judgment move's the God of Love For tydings by a Raven and a Dove. The COVENANT. The Deluge past the gratious Lord repents That justice should expect such punishments; Therefore a Bow i'th' clouds assures, by rain The world shall never be destroi'd again; So willing God his own is to content His word a Sign confirm's i'th' Firmament; NOAH Overtaken. Noah, though perfect found, look's to his vine More then himself, and is o'recome with Wine: This was too bad; but thrice accursed he. Who his own Fathers Nakedness would see; Noah's was a surprizal; Ham's offence Has put a blott on Natures Cheek e're since. BABEL. The Sons of Men grown insolent again, Design to build a Babel, but in vain; For while to th' skey's they boast the top shall reach They a confounding down-fall from it fetch; Diversity of Language undermind's, Working by wonders, yet they wrought by signs. GOD Blessing ABRAM. Abram in Exile, has a Promise made, Of a more glorious Land then that he had; The terms obscure indeed, but vouch'd by heav'n And Canaan but a type, yet Christ is given: He that can stedfast in assurance rest, Has what he would enjoy lockt in his breast. The DISAGREEMENT. Abram and Lot fall out; (the rich forsake Their dearest Friends when Mammon lies at stake;) 'Twas for a spot of Turfe they disagreed, (Men often covet most, when least they need) The promise is renu'd, an Altar built, Where faithful Abram more assurance felt. MELCHIZEDECH'S Blessing. In Sidims Vale four Kings encounter five, And the design on with much fury drive: Lot taken Prisoner, Abram with his Bands Of Souldiers, rescues him from cruel Hands: Feasted with blessing both from King and Priest Melchizedech, after whose orders Christ. ABRAHAM entertaining three Angels. Three Angels curteous Abraham entertains With old frugality, not sparing pains; Oats, Milk, and Butter, then expostulates The case on Sodoms side, with strong debates. He makes his own terms, e're he makes an end, 'Twas boldly done; but Abraham was Gods friend. LOT entertaining two Angels. Lot entertains two Angels, and next morn Unnatural Sodom and Gomorrah burn, As soon as he (in hast) was got to Zoar They are calcin'd that burnt in lust before: The Law denouncing sentence let him die Hell falls from Heaven to punish Sodomie. LOT and his two Daughters. Corn, Wine, and Oyl, choice gifts; yet Lot's beguil'd, By whom both of his Daughters prove with Child; Out of incestuous loyns the Moabites Have their extraction, and the Ammonites: They tempted at a time when he was not As yesterday, the good, old, sober Lot. The CAVEAT. The Patriarch, in fear, his Wife denies, (Though dearer to him, then his very Eyes) Abimelech, admonish't in a dream, With royal gifts returns her back to him, But not without a check; nor would he buy Pleasures too dear from opportunity. HAGAR in Distress. Hagar in anguish and perplex't condition: An Angel comfort's by Divine Commission: With Bread and Water Abraham (Oh distess!) Give's her the Child, to dwell i' th' Wilderness, Unhappy Pilgrims! to inhabit where No Food, or Raiment, but from Wolf or Bear. The TUTELAR Angel. The Water spent, and no assistance nigh, Under a Shrub the helpless Babe doth lie: Her tears are all is left, through anguish few, With which her pining Cheeks she doe's bedew: Her, at a distance, (loath to see him die) An Angel shew's a Well for a supplie. ABRAHAM'S Tryal. For proof of faith, Isaac, a promis'd seed, By his own Father Abrahams hand must bleed: The Wood lay'd on the Altar, and the Knife Stretch'd out, a Ram saves trembling Isaac's Life, Dispute must take no place, if God advise, Obedience here does pass for Sacrifice. The PROSPEROUS JOURNIE. Abraham, first having prai'd, does soon dispatch His Man to bring his Son a properr match; All things succeed: Rebecca makes no stay, Return'd they meet their Lord upon the way: Her watering 'till the Camels all gave o're Was token of the blessing laid in store. ABRAHAMS Death and Burial. The Father of the faithful aged grown, His Race now run, is gather'd to his own: His Monument prepar'd, lodg'd in a Cave I'th' Field of Iphron, where is Sarah's Grave: Corruption is our Mother, in our urn To dust from whence we came, we shall return. The BIRTHRIGHT Sold. Esau for that he quick dispatch could make Finds Isaac's favour for his Vensons sake: But bringing a good Stomach from the Field's For a few Pottage he his Birthright yeilds: How wretched he whose thoughts on eating rest, And Soul to th' lowest Region is deprest? The DISAPPOINTMENT. Jacob, in subtilty, his Mother dressing A Dish of Savory Meat, obtain's the blessing: Esau deluded, (or supplanted rather) With tears cries out (too late,) bless me too, Father. Advice in a disguise in season came; He should have sooner look't into his Name. JACOB'S Ladder. Lo! Jacob in a vision Angels sees, Ascending and descending by degrees; His Pillow is a Stone, which after stood A lasting Monument, his Vow made good. He that his speculations 'has a-loft, Makes all things easie to himself and soft. The HARD BARGAIN. Jacob, approaching, to a Fountain, meet's With Rachel, takes acquaintance, and then greet's; Ask's her to wife, seven years being serv'd before, 'Has Leah given: for Rachel serves seven more; Love puts up foul Indignity and wrong, To gain its dearest wish seems never long. The CONFLICT. Jacob at Peniel Wrestle's until day, Nor will he let the Angel go away, Without a blessing, when he made a vow His name was Jacob, but 'tis Israel now: That Praier effectual is, which often try'd, Delay'd, repuls'd, yet will not be deny'd. The MUTUAL EMBRACE. Esau and Jacob, though i'th' womb they strove, And fell out afterward, here they love, They Meet, Embrace, and Kiss, they kindly Speak, And Weep, each hanging on the others neck; Revenge is Poor; one end for which we live, Is to forget offences, and forgive. DINAH Deflowr'd. Diuah defil'd by Shechem, Hamors Son, Simeon and Levi hearing what was done All Males are put to th' Sword, the City spoil'd, While in a boundless rage their choler boil'd: Upon a weak Maid to commit a Rape 'Tis easie, not so easie to escape. The COMBINATION. Joseph repeat's his Dream, (from Visions) twice, For which his Brethren turn his enemies; By all of them he hated was before, But that Rehersal makes them hate him more; They spare his life, cast him into a pit, And selling him, Gods Hand was seen in it. Love-sick TAMAR. Tamar, for Shelah not bestow'd upon her, Judah, her Husbands Father, brings dishonour: Reward consent procures, and to oblige A Signet, Staff, and Bracelets are the Pledg. Her Doom from him is Let the Harlot Burn, But alter'd, when he knew she had serv'd his turn. The MODEST YOVTH. Joseph, his Ladies fond Amours oppos'd, By her fals charge in a deep Dungeon clos'd, As once her Love, so now her hate can brave, He free in Chaines, she her own Passions Slave: Delights are Momentary, Pleasures cloy; 'Tis braver to abstain than to enjoy. The INTERPRETER. Pharaoh once and again disturb'd in Visions, Tells Joseph what had puzl'd his Magicians; The Dreams explain'd, a Famine's understood, To his Advancement, and the publick good: He that could the Decrees of Heaven make known, Deserv'd his being next an Earthly Throne. The FAMINE. 'Tis come, and Jacob sends his Sons to buy In Egypt Corn, each one is call'd a spie, And into Prison cast, but Simeons doome Being to stay, the rest go laden home: When provocations a Rich mind infest Love knows not to dissemble, but in jest. CONSCIENCE Awake. Joseph, Lord Governour all round about, His Brethren crouch unto; (his Dreams are out) Conscience let loose on antient guilt reflects, And vengeance, by delay improv'd, expects; Vicissitude on humane things attends But honour scornes advantage upon Friends. The UNWILLING GRANT. With much reluctancy, and grief of Heart Jacob consents with's youngest Child to part: Joseph the feasted strangers welcome makes, Where Benjamin a five fold Mess partakes. When Providence is at the Helm to steer Nor Passenger nor Mariner should fear. EXODUS. The KIND MIDWIUES. The Israelites the more they are opprest, Even to a wonder, are the more encreast: So fragrant Herbs when trodden under foot The higher grow, and take the deeper root: Those Infants which the rapid brook should have The Midwives, fearing God, from mischief save. The TENDER NURSE. Moses is born; the Tyrant Pharaoh's curse Intended fails; his Daughter proves the Nurse: A few slight flaggs preserve him safe and sound, A man of God had otherwaies been drown'd: All Children prove not like their Parents, bad, Though he no bowels, yet his Daughter had. The UMPIRE. Grown up, he sees a Lord assault his slave, Smites the Egyptian, does the Hebrew save; Yet his dull Country could not from this sign, The fate of Egypt, nor their own Divine: The secrets of Gods will are seldom seen To any but who have Gods servants been. MOSES Incognito. Moses escap't from Pharaohs high disdain, Unto a Priest and Prince of Midian, By faith and gentle Arts his Daughter won, And in his Pilgrimage obtain'd a Son; 'Tis wisdom to retire when dangers nigh, And good success attends sincerity. The BURNING BUSH. To Moses, keeping Jethro's flock appear'd A burning Bush, and thence a voice was heard; To Egypts Tyrant in Jehovah's Name Hast, and his Hebrew Slaves my Freemen Claim: When Heaven insists upon't and Earth denies, The Down-fall must be great, if God arise. The CRUEL TASK-MASTER. Pharaoh grows angry at the message Moses And Aaron bring; he harder tasks imposes; Brick must be made, (to keep them more in awe,) And yet the Infidel denies them Straw; Will above reason when it most intends An others, in its own Destruction ends. The TYRANT Plagued. The Nile flow's Blood, Vermin, and Insects swarm; Beasts and Men rot; Heaven does the Meteors Arm; The ninth Plague boundless Night brought, &amp; remov'd, Yet Pharaoh more in Stubborness improv'd: When Hearts are once grown Adamantine hard, They neither do themselves, nor God regard. The DELIVERANCE. The Passover, the First born slain, at last The Bondmen are dispatch't away in hast: After Four Hnndred Years and Thirty, they Are all brought out, on a most noted day; Deliverance from oppression with controul Makes a new Man, and gives another Soul. PHARAOH Drowned. See how the Rageing and Tempestuous Waves Obedience pay, while God his chosen saves! At holding up a Rod the Waves divide, Strong as a Wall of Brass on either side: But Pharaohs Chariots and his Horsemen find It had been safer to have staid behind. The REPINEING ISRAELITES. The great Salvation wrought, anon instead Of Thanks, Complaints are made for Flesh and Bread; Manna and Quails are plentifully sent, The most ungrateful Rebels to content: Such insolence for vengeance calls with wings, Quick judgment, and a swift Destruction brings. The MUTINEERS. Into a Wilderness the People brought, Their next complaint is they shall die for drought They threaten their Meek Ruler, 'till he smites A Rock, whence Water flows to th' Israelites: Strange Miracle! strange if the Multitude Requite not favours by appearing Rude. AMALEK Over-thrown. After Refreshment an Alarum comes, The shriller Trumpets noise exceeds the Drumms; While Holy Hands are up, Gods cause prevails, But Amalek's when down, (Praier never fails) He that in earnest Supplication pleads Less seen, does more then who an Army leads. MOSES upon the Mount. Mount Sinai in a flame, while all admire, The People are forbid to venture higher: They promise due obedience, none go up But consecrated Moses to the top: Gods presence may all rev'rence well require, Who in his wrath, is a Consuming Fire. The TABERNACLE. The Heavenly Tent, by Gods own purpose pitch't With Types and Sacraments must be enrich't: Ark, Mercy Seat, High Priest, and sprinkling Blood, (By penitent believers understood) If a Decorum due was to the Law, Who dares from Gospel Decency withdraw; The TABLE'S Broken. The head strong Rabble giving ill advice To Aaron, get a Calf to Idolize; A golden Calf; Moses in great disdain The Tables breakes; the Idolaters are slain. So to be angry, so to shew a zeal, Was not to do a miss, but to do well. LEVITICUS. The ALTAR. Abihu, joyn'd with Nadah, both conspire To offer unto God unlawful Fire: The high Priests Sons found guilty make it worse, Their bold attempt call'd for a speedy curse: How suitable the punishment and Sin! They die by Fire, which their offence had bin. NUMBERS. The SPIES. Moses sends Messengers to understand The excellency of the promis'd Land: Clusters of Grapes denote a Land desir'd By faith, with utmost Wars to be acquir'd. Patience with perseverance win's the day, 'Tis good to gain at last, though with delay. The REMEDY. The Rout still mutinous, for their hissing Tongue By winged Serpents Fiery Lances stunge Chastis'd by Scorpions, look in ardent grief Up to the Brazen Serpent for relief; To murmur and repine is to encrease Perturbance of the mind, not purchase Peace. BALAAM'S ASS. King Balak plots Destruction to the Host Of Israel, but his designes are crost: The dumb Ass speaking with Mans voice forbad The purposes that he with Balaam had: To Sacrifice and make the Altar smoak For ill, was not to offer, but provoke. DEUTERONOMIE. The PROSPECT. Moses, from Pisgah, views the Land below Of promise, into which he must not go: He dies; the Mourning lasts out thirty daies, Succeeding ages celebrate his praise; The Memory of the Righteous cannot die, 'Till time it self end in Eternity. The CONTROVERSIE. The Israelites for Moses make great moan, But where his Sepulcher is, as yet unknown; The Devil and Michael are at hard contest About his Body, while his Soul's at rest. Upright and virtuous need no Tombes erect, Their Monuments are the Hearts of the Elect. JOSHUA. The CHAMPION. From Circumcision fresh, with Sword in hand, Joshua dares bid an Armed Angel stand: Jehovah is a Buckler and a Shield, To animate his Volunteers i'th' Field. He that Gods battels fights receives his pay Before hand, and is sure to gain the day. The MEMORIAL. The Brook divided, out of each Tribe one For a Remembrance is to fix a stone Where the Priests feet stood, to remain a mark, While Forty Thousand wait upon the Ark; Wonders exceeding reason, puzling sence, Memorials well deserve in their defence. The SIEGE. Jericho shuts up her Gates, 'till at the sound Of Rams-horns all the Walls fall to the ground, Such means the High and Mightie one will use His haughty adversaries to amuse; Where City and Builders most accursed were, Rahah the Harlot God is pleas'd to spare. The SACRILEDGE. A pitch't Field, Israel meets with a disgrace, Cast lot's the cause on wretched Achan place: 'Twas not so much the Talents, or the Wedge, Or Garments ston'd him, as the Sacriledge: The publique Curse of private avarice A Nation shakes, and ruines Families. The SOLSTICE. A mighty work in hand, the Moon and Sun Stand still at Joshua's word, 'till it is done: Great Hail-stones witness where Five Kings are caught And Hang'd, with Twelve more to Perdition brought: Let Potentates to fear and tremble learn, When God and Nature ioyn in One concern. The ANAKIMS Cut off. More Kings discomfited, the Ammonites Assist the Hittites and the Jebusites: Those from the Mountains and the Vallies sight And with the Anakims are put to flight. Such as draw back when Gods cause lies at stake, Do their own mercy, with the truth forsake. JUDGES. The REQUITAL. Under whose Table Seventy Kings, their Thumbs And great Toes Chizzel'd off, did gather Crumms; Adonibezek taken may subjoyn, How justly am I paid in mine own Coyn? Astrea's equal ballance even stands, Justice 'has Leaden feet, but Iron hands. The HEROINE. Faint Sisera betakes himself to sleep, The Captain weary, 'tis profound and deep; Jael, her sex excelling, strikes him dead, His Temples nail'd, not laid in Honours Bed; Women are Tender, yet where they mislike The avenging blow falls Heavy, when they strike. GIDEON'S PRESENT. The Israelites oppressed under Midian, An Angel to deliver them send's Gideon: His gift touch't by him, as the Flame did rise, Was of a present made a Sacrifice: To evidence that from Heaven the orders came, The Witness is a Spirit and a Flame. GIDEON'S SIGNES. An Angel unto Gideon makes it known What Gods intention was to save his own: Who, to confirm the matter to the full, Asks, and has two signes in one fleece of Wool. One Token from above might him amaze, Reduplicated, 'twas Transcendent grace. The SUPERNUMERARIES From Thirty and Two Thousand he's advis'd To have his mighty Army modeliz'd Into Three Hundred; he obeys, who knew God saves alike by many, or by few: To put in Arm's of Flesh our Confidence Is to neglect and slight Omnipotence. The STRATAGEM. God having purpos'd Midian to subdue, With Amalek and the confederate crew, A stratagem of Pitchers, Trumpets, Lamps Takes off their Man-hood, and their Valour damp's. Hope blasted, fear, despondency, with rage, Wait upon such as without God engage. The DISCHARGE. Abimelech by a conspiracie And Murder seat's himself in Majestie: A peice of Mil-stone, by a Womans hand, Discharges him from Court-ship and command. How weak are earthly Monarchs, and how frail, Against whom Woman can, and Chance prevail! JEPTHAH'S VOW. When as the Ammonites were all subdu'd Jephthah speakes his intended Gratitude: That Vow upon him was a sacred Tye, His Daughter comes out first, she first must Die. Words cannot be recall'd, and vows once made Inviolable are, and must be paid. SAMSON'S VALOUR. Samson in strength and vigour, his designes Are for a Wife amongst the Philistines; In's journie a Lion by the Throat he shakes, Soon as return'd, his Wife another takes. To match amongst Gods enemies and theirs Shew'd Samson's weakness greater far then hers. The RESENTMENT. Affronted thus, he is resolv'd to Burn, By Fire-brands ty'd to Foxes tailes, their Corn; For Father Burnt, and Wife, it comes to pass A Thousand fall by th' Jaw-bone of an Ass. Those that provoke a Gyant should bespeak Their Graves, or else confess themselves too weak. The RESURRECTION TYPE. Barr'd gates of Gaza by the break of day The Gyantean Ruler bears away: Hir'd Delilah thrice her subtile charmes repeats To find his strength, thrice he her Arts defeats. Importunate Solicitations force, And that extort which often proves a Curse. DELILAH'S FRAUD. At last, laid in her Lap, they slight and scorn The Man of might, lull'd fast a sleep and Shorn: Drawn in by cunning slights and treacheries He pulls the House upon his Foes, and dies. Unhappy Samson! thou before wast Blind, Or hadst not put thy God out of thy Mind. The LEVIT'S CASE. A Levite and his Wife for Gods House bound, Having in Gibeah scarce a Lodging found, Streight the Lascivious crew (not without strife For both) to Vile Lust sacrifice her life. All laws of Nations and of Nature fail When Anarchy in Israel does prevail. The ANNIVERSARY, Or the Surpris'd Virgins. The Benjamites, except Six Hundred slain, (A grief the rest ill knew how to sustain;) To such as did survive, and had no Wives Direction a supply from Shiloh gives. When men for their transgressions quit their hold, They must do as they may, not as they would. RUTH. The DUTIFUL Daughter-in-law. Ruth, finding favour, Gleans in Boaz's Fields, Beats cut of Barly what an Ephah yeilds; Parcht Corn and Morsels steept in Vinegar With our Fore-fathers was esteemed good Cheer. 'Tis dull to glut when life is but a Span, A frugal Table feasts the Inward Man. The MIDNIGHT BLUSH. With Boaz Ruth claiming Kins-womans right Laies her self humbly at his feet all night; Such Modesty and Chastity in both They well might after take each others troth. Those that are Innocent and Pure in Heart Even when they are together dwell apart. I. SAMUEL. The ARK TAKEN. In one day Eli's impious Sons are Kill'd, (The man of Gods words now are all fulfill'd,) To hear the Arke was taken makes him break In a desponding Syncope his Neck. Reproof for grand faults in a gentle strain, Is to bid Children do the same again. DAGON'S DOWN-FALL. The Philistines the Ark of God have got, Into the House of Dagon it is put: That dumb, deaf Idol, they so much adore He Cringes first, then Sprawls upon the Floor. He that shall worship that which Hands have made Does forfeit reason, and himself degrade. The RASH ADVENTURE. Smitten with Emrods, they resolve to bring The Ark back, with a Trespass Offering: Those that into it look without respect To what it was, sustain the sad effect. Things Sacred are not for the Vulgar sort Who when they are at best, take all in sport. The HUMILIATION. Abinadab the Ark (commanded) takes, The Congregation their Confession makes, By Praier and Supplication; Samuel winns A victory against the Philistines. The way to be successful in the Field Is upon God and his support to Build. SAUL ANOINTED. The Prophet Samuel here Anointeth Saul, (A goodly Person for his shape, and tall) To prove that Gods decrees are constant still Sign upon Sign confirm his sacred will. When for a lasting Throne God sets apart He looks not to the Stature, but the Heart. The PANICK FEAR. Jonathan, unknown to his Royal Father smites The Philistines, and resolutely fights; A sudden Consternation does them seize, And they against themselves turn enemies. Infatuation will possess the Brain Of Reprobates, and scatter all their Train. The AFTER Reckoning. Amalek, long since devoted, now must fall For their Old Grudge, under the hand of Saul: His sparing Agag, kept him but in store 'Till the Decision of that day was o're. Pride and Presumption are unlucky Signes, Fortune, like Glass, cracks soonest when she Shines. The GYANT. The huge, Portentous, Domineering Gathist Out-dareing Heaven and prateing like an Atheist, The stripling David with a Stone and Sling Knock's down, and brings his Head to Saul the King. The resolute Christian when the cause is Gods Sets out with Courage, and falls on with Odds! The TRIUMPHANT March. The Champion of the Philistines now dead, They bear away his mighty Sword and Head; All kinds of Musick play, while Virgins fair Trip it, and with their voices split the Air. Weapons of War though in a Gyants Arm May Terrifie the Truth, but never Harm. The LAWFUL CHARM. While Musick Saul with Emulation strikes, In Anthem's David's prais'd, which Saul mislikes; Expecting one day by his hand to fall, The Javeling cast at him, it stuck i'th' Wall. Suspition of a Rival gnaws, and frets, And Rage unlimited with Disdain begets. The MATCHLESS Friend. David and Jonathan sworn bosom Friends, The Son reveals the Fathers bloody ends; An Arrow sent from Jonathan's true Bow David directs, when Anxious, what to do. A Friend exceeds a Brother; David must Trust him, who his own Father could not trust. The PUSILLANIMOUS Churle. David, put to it hard, beggs a recruit; Nabal returns a Clownish answer to't: Abigael in her Wisdom peace acquires, All known, within Ten daies the Churle expires. Wisdom Reigns over all, and will be seen; 'Twas that alone made Abigael a Queen. The NOBLE ENEMIE. Saul in pursuit of David, with express Commands to Murther him i'th' Wilderness He at his Mercy has; but Heaven appointed He should not die, with touch not mine Anointed. So generous Lions spare the prostrate Wretch, If with his Belly to the Ground he stretch. The SAFE COUNCELLOUR. David (as he was wont) consults the Lord, If he should put the Amalekites to Sword For spoiling Ziklag; God gives him his charge, And he the Foes, his borders to enlarge. When Military men advice want most Who can direct them like the Lord of Host? The FORLORN HOPE. Saul and his Armour-bearer when they saw Themselves past hope upon Mount Gilboa, Fall on their Swords, where Jonathan and two More Sons of Sauls bid all the World adieu. Ah Jonathan the Kind! now thou art gone David is half dead too, and left alone. II. SAMUEL. The REMOVAL of the ARK. Uzza for touching of the Ark which shook, Is smitten in the place where hold he took; Temerity where Gods presence still attends No wonder if in Punishment it ends. Michal for Scoffs when David danc'd his best, Her Curse a Barren Womb is, and dry Breast. The AMBASSADORS Affronted. The Messengers of David us'd with spite Occasions War against the Ammonite, With whom the Syrians taking part the fight Is lost to them, and God maintains his right. Ambassadors affronted leagues disown, The publique shar'd disgrace in what was done. The AMOROUS Glance. David at Ease, upon a quick surprise Rendring his heart to his ill-guarded eyes, Hides sin with sin, Oh! where can Pride have place If so much Frailty dwell with so much Grace? Where Chronicles blazen his renown &amp; praise, The matter of Uriah nip's the bay's. The RECANTATION. In words obscure and figurative Speech Nathan does David of his Sin impeach; He hides it not, but on his Knees repents And in true penitential tears relents. What aggravated when the Message came, Was that he took the poor mans only Lamb. The COUNTERFEIT. Amnon in love with Tamar, calls for Meat, (Pretending Sickness) from her hand to eat; He feeds not, but enjoys his Brutish Lust, The heat allay'd, she out of Doors is thrust. Inordinate affections when they Burn End in the snuffs of Hatred, Shame, and scorn. The REVENGE. Absalom, understanding Tamar's case, Resolves Revenge; appoints the time, and place; At a Sheep-sheering, (all the Brothers met,) Amnon is slain, to take off the regret. Sense of an injur'd Sister inward reaks, 'Till out like Thunder from a cloud it breaks. The UNNATURAL SON. The Rebel Son against his Prince and Father, First pays his vow, then up his Troops does gather: Hang'd betwixt Heaven and Earth, the Traytors Heart Is penetrated there by Joab's Dart. Rebellion, and against a Parent wrought, Is that which leaves an Everlasting blot. The SYCOPHANT. Joab intending Amasa to kill By flattery and deceit obtains his will; Dissimulation may effect foul ends, But Barbarous they that use it to their Friends. Turbulent Sheba a-side by Faction led Raises the Seige, but with the loss of's Head. I. KINGS. The IMPARTIAL MAGISTRATE Two Harlots, being newly brought to Bed, Strive for a living Child, and slight the dead: By Solomon then the matter is decided Against her who would see the quick divided. Good Omen 'twas that he was hence Renown'd, And this the Second time the King was Crown'd. SOLOMON'S TEMPLE. Though God dwell not in Temples that are made With hands, but Mansions that can never fade, 'Tis fit that Structure be of Noble Fashion In which with fear we work out our Salvation. No Architecture can augment Gods worth, Yet gratitude suggests to set it forth. The DEDICATION. King Solomon at his Temples Dedication Begins with solemn Prayer and Adoration: Peace Offerings and Burnt Sacrifices follow, To feast the People, and the House to hallow, He that himself to seek his Maker sets All other things into the bargain gets. The ACKNOWLEDGMENT. The wisest King that ever Scepter sway'd, Has from the Queen of Sheba homage paid, Owning by Fame that She was to him sent, But entertain'd to Her Astonishment. That King whom the Almighty has inspir'd, Is justly far and near to be admir'd. The ZIDONIAN GODDESS. Mounted on high, and Wisdom at Her feet, See Astoreth, the Zidonian Goddess set: So many Wives and Concubines had got, And kept that Heart which longer God had not. How slight and vain a thing is Flesh and Blood! When left unto itself, expect no good. The FATAL COUNTERMAND. A Prophet God with strict injunctions sends, A Brother Prophet countermands pretends: The ill-obedient proves a Lions prey, Let no Authority known truth out-weigh. No Consultation stands against the Lord, The safest Rule is to believe His word. The USURPER. Elah Carousing to excess, is slain By his own servant Zimri; Zimri's Reign Omri cuts short; King Ahab him succeeds As well in Empire as ungodly Deeds. Succession plac'd in an illegal Line Withers, and shrinks like fruit without a Rine. The RECRUIT. Starv'd Ravens (Birds of prey) if God think good, Shall for Elijah purvey daily Food: The Widow who had little Oyl before, By giving that away, has endless store. The just can live by Faith, when Victual fails The unlook't for Ship returns with swelling Sails. The FAIR TRYAL. The numerous Priests of Baal implore his aid, Whether he be a God the Trial's made; They Cut, and Lance, they cry, and call amain, God is but One and their Mock-god is vain. What pitty 'tis a Deity of note Should have no mercy on his Priests sore Throat? The DESPONDING PROPHET. Elijah laid under afflictions Rod, Caus'd by proud Jezebel, has help from God: An Angel bids him hold his Resolution, And bear up manful under Persecution. The Cruel and Malicious take no rest, An angry Woman is an Hornets nest. The ARCHER. Ahab, as Graceless as his Wife, both foes To good Elijah, into Battel goes; He that in others Blood took such delight Has Doggs lick up his own, in open sight. The Shaft successful prov'd and Justice hit The Mark, but one above directed it. II. KINGS. The CONDITIONAL LEGACIE. Elijah with his Mantle does divide Jordan, and in a Fiery Chariot ride; At parting he his Spirit doth bequeath Unto Elisha while he staies beneath. What cursed Simon Magus would have bought Is here a Free gift, and Entail'd for nought. The SAD EUENT. Elisha indefatigable grown In serving of his God, and him alone, The Children mock; go Bald-head up, up, go, ('Twas all they said) Two Bears kill Forty Two, Do not my Prophets harm was a command Ill-bred Idolaters could ill-understand. The STRICT CREDITOR. A pious Prophets Widdow left in Debt, When her Two Sons the Creditor did Threat, Implores Elisha; Her store of Oyl one Cruse She into borrow'd Vessels must infuse. Reliance upon Providence sustains And Satisfaction with Advantage gains. GEHAZI's CHEAT. Elisha when by Naaman ask't to Cure His Leprosie (as loth to live impure) 'Tis granted Gratis; but Gehazi's Lie And Filching gives himself that Leprosie. How just a Punish?nt! the Hand now sore Had not bin so, but that it Itch't before. The EXTREMITIE. To enlarge the Prophets Schools a wonder's wrought And Iron swimms, (which Nature never taught) Samaria for her sins in such a streight Women are their own Children found to eat. Philosophy must herein acquiess, And her self to a Nonplus put, confess. The INCREDULOUS LORD. Into their Host Four Lepers at twilight Escaping bring news of the Assyrians flight: Plenty proclaim'd, a Lord cries God can't do't, He finds it true, when trodden Under-foot. Not to believe when Heaven sends an express Is not distrust, but a Fool-hardiness. PRIDE with a FALL. Gay Jezebel with an Embelish't Face, Opens the Casement, with intent to gaze: Had Zimri peace, quoth she, who slew his Master? Head-long to the devouring Doggs they cast her. Naboth was Murder'd, she made Ahab strike Blood answers Blood, and both are serv'd alike. The GHOST. The Moabites invading of the Land, A dead man is observ'd upright to stand; This was a Marvel, but yet not so much If we consider what the Corps did touch. The Righteous end not when they die, but have An Efficatious power ev'n in the Grave. The REFORMATION. Good Hezekiah, second unto none Came after, or before him that had gone, Roots out Idolatry, removes high places, Cuts down the Groves, and Images defaces. Idolaters their worship first begun In Groves, because asham'd to see the Sun. The PARRICIDES. Thousands and Thousands of Assyrian might Are by an Angel Cut off in one night; Sonacherib at false worship gets his death From his own Sons, to whom he gave their breath. Unthought of Execution follows those That trust in Graven Images repose. The FAITHFUL WITNESS. Kings are but mortal; Hezekiah lies Upon his Death-bed, and to Heaven he cries For longer life; the Sun is to attest God cannot be unfaithful in the least. When grim Death is with his Memento sent The best man wants more leisure to Repent. The UNANIMOUS RESOLVE. Josiah set upon a Throne of State, Does all his Priests and People Congregate; Devoutly they with one consent and Heart All swear from Gods laws never to depart. A solemn League, (where Kings are first) does well, And if perform'd, withstands the gates of Hell. The CAPTIVITIE. Jerusalem begirt, and all her Glory Concluding in a Melancholy story: Huldah the Prophetess Destruction saw, And told it, at the Reading of the Law. Ah Zedekiah! could'st thou call to mind, Thy Murder'd Sons before they made thee Blind? I. CHRONICLES. The FELO DE SE. Saul asks the Kindness of his Armour-bearer To Kill him, as the Philistines drew nearer; Deny'd, he Kills himself; besmear'd with blood His Hairy Scalp on Dagon is bestow'd. To recollect bad actions, done before, And not to be undone, torments the more. The DIFFIDENT PRINCE. Mistrustful David gives it in command To number all his Warriers in the Land; He falls into Gods hands; the Plague begins, But th' Angel spares Jerusalem's foul sins. Frail man! his politique contrivance past, He must be put into Gods hands at last. II. CHRONICLES. The SAFEST COURSE. Jehosaphat Environ'd round about With Enemies, and in great fear and doubt, His Resolutions are to God to go, The end proves well, because he did do so. They that assurance place in Heaven's support May in the Forefront march, and Scale the Fort. DAGON A-LOFT. Dagon is up, Joash will have it so, And all must to the stupid Image bow; None but Old Zachariah firm and fast, Who rather would be Ston'd then fail at last. Who Martyrdom endures for acting right Mounts above Spleen, and may defie all Spite. NEHEMIAH. Jerusalem (where God was most renown'd) Nebucadnezzar having raz'd to th' ground, While Nehemiah mourns to tell its fall, They are Recorded who rebuild the Wall. When War, and Desolation is our lot The memory of the just shall never rot. ESTHER. The IMPOLITIQUE STATES-MAN. To Esther the Kings Scepter is extended, The Jews and Mordicai by her befriended; Male-content Haman, in his pride and height Scorns both, as standing yet a Favorite. Ambition thwarted strives to do her worst, And puffs the owner up, until he burst. The BLACK BOOK OPEN. At dead of night, when Mortals take their rest, Ahasuerus feels his soul opprest; The Books brought forth, the Gallows set so high Proves the contrivers fatal destiny. Nothing but discontent while he surviv'd, A nation had been lost had Hamon thriv'd. JOB. The CONTENTED WRETCH. Satan allow'd to punish Job with losses Of Children, Goods, and other Worldly Crosses, His answer is, though almost in despair, Naked I hither came, shall go hence bare. When man with Tempests is to Ship-wrack tost, Contentment is a gift can nere be lost, PSALMIST ROYAL. The SWEET SINGER. King David with his Harp in Symphony Delights to hear Glory to God on high: 'Twas Israel's Sweet Singer who best knew To render to his God the Praises due. Such as to Gods House take delight to go Appease him for themselves, and others too. CANTICLES. The SERAPHICK DIALOGUE. Christ and his Spouse pathetically Court Each other, with unspeakable Effort: Their Dialogues are all of things above, Until at last they both fall Sick of Love. Affection heightned with a strong desire Is restless 'till it's end it can acquire. ISAIAH. The CMMISSIONER. Isaiah is commanded to controle, A Seraphim comes to him with a Cole, To touch his Tongue; he needs not be affraid, Or shrink, that has the Almighty for his aid. Had he forborn, and not kept vice in awe He had not undergone the tearing Sawe. JEREMIAH. The WARRANTED REPROVER. The Prophet Jeremiah in a Vision, An Almond tree sees, (noteing Expedition;) Impiety spread over all the Nations, A seething Pot foretels their Desolations. Sins multiply, and steal on by degrees, Until, like Wine, men settle on the Lees. The PRISONER SET FREE. Denouncing Judgments boldly, as he ought, Being by God himself his errand taught, He's thrown into the Dungeon; past all hopes An Ethiopian draws him out with Ropes. Extremity aloud for succour Cries, And handmaid is to Opportunities. EZEKIEL. The THREAT. Four Cherubins and Four Wheels represent Gods Glorious Majesty, and Excellent; A Roll out of the Clouds is made a Type To signifie Iniquities were Ripe. Into Gods awful Presence let none Prie 'Till Mortal put on Immortality. The MISTERY, or the Second RESURRECTION TYPE Ezekiel by the Spirit led, beholds Dry Bones, which two fold Mistery infolds; Judah to Israel joyn'd by Gods Selection, With an assurance of our Resurrection. When Sap and Moisture fail he that said Live, And thence Created, can Revival give. DANIEL. The VAIN ASTROLOGER. Nebucadnezzar Dreams, the Astrologers Are to unriddle what import it bears; They fail, and suffer for it, Daniel speaks The Matter, and the Secret open breaks. Though Magick some things may disclose ere done, Secrets there are belong to God alone. The FIERY FURNACE. Three resolv'd Heroes summon'd to their Tryal Commanded to Fall down, give flat denyal; Cast into Furnace, heat forsakes the Fire, But the Accessaries Burn when they draw nigher: Plain Nature must her property forget If the Almighty speak, be here no heat, The STENOGRAPHER. Belshazzar Feasting all his Peers in State Has in Three Words a prospect of his fate; After much Wine ('tis strange) his Visage Pale, O terrible Hand-writing on the Wall! Astonishment and Trembling is their hire Who, laying God aside, to rule aspire. The CONFEDERATE PRESIDENTS. Wise Daniel acting as chief President The rest to make away with him consent; Cast into Lyons Den, by their great power, They hurt him not; the accusers they devour. Envy with Hatred joyn'd bears no allay, But ruine plots the most Compendious way. TRANSITORY MONARCHS. Those Four Beasts Daniel in a Vision saw Denote Four Kings which kept the World in awe, Whose Government and Reign stood for a time, But Christs is everlasting and sublime. The Mighty, be their Lease for many years 'Tis Cancel'd when unwelcome Death appears. HOSEA. The ADULTERESS. God to Illustrate Typically how With obstinate offenders it will go, Hosea is to take to him a Wife Of an Unclean and Profligated life. No means from Heav'n are wanting to express The Shame and Punishment of Wickedness. JOEL. The CALM. The sounding of a Trumpet warns a Fast, A Lamentation for Transgressions past; Sion is comforted; the Godly find Inward refreshment from a troubled mind. Tranquility of Soul, though it come late, Is what the Wise will buy at any rate. JONAH. The WHALE, or the Third RESURRECTION TYPE. Jonah refusing Gods command to embrace Is swallowed by a Whale, for three daies space; Cast over-board (by his own free consent) He knew he could not Sink, could he Repent. His re-appearing as the third day ends To the Holy Jesus's Resurrection tends. The MALE-CONTENT. Jonah repineing sets him down to see What would become of sinful Nineveh: Sackcloth and Ashes dull the Keener Sword And they find Pardon, though he find no Gourd. Tears of Repentance wash off every sin, And Reconcile as if it had not bin. MICAH. The PREDICTION. The Prophet Micah shews he did fore-see Gods Irreversible reveal'd decree; Christs everlasting Kingdome is foretold And none so long as He can Scepter hold. From that time Earthly Kings remove here-hence Shall never-ending Monarchy commence. HABAKKUK. The PETITIONER. Habakkuk instant at his Prayers implores Attention from the God-head he adores; The stout Chaldean Bands are made a Scourge Gods Chosen People from their Sins to Purge. Much is done by Contrition, and Remorse, But the Importunate take Heaven by Force. ZECHARIAH. The JOYNT SOLLICITORS. An Exhortation to Repentance, where Both Man and Angel Sympathize in Praier; Jerusalem thy Comfort is at hand, God cannot This, and muchless That withstand. 'Tis bounden duty to Request below, Hereafter we shall Reap what here we Sow. TOBIT. The MISCHANCE Well-meaning Tobit, when to rest compos'd Has a Mischance before his Eyes were clos'd; The Swallows from the Wall mute in his Eyes, Whil'st Anna, his Wife, works hard to get supplyes. A little got with Honest Care and Pains Gives more content then vast Unlawful Gains. RAPHAEL and TOBIAS. Tobias, charg'd by Tobit, steers his course To Media, in hopes to re-imburse; The Angel Raphael bears him company, (For Man but little lower is then he.) Country, nor Friends, Rest, nor Content, nor Health Nor Life are thought on, where the end is Wealth. TOBIT COMFORTED. Tobias upon his return is met, By his Blind Father, who receives his debt From Media, Tobias clears his sight To satisfie him that the Tale was right. Mony at once and Eye sight to re-gain Was beyond Expectation to obtain. JUDITH. The BRAVE EXPLOIT. Puissant Holofernes with his Host, Too confident, when no such cause to boast, Dies by a Female hand, and steals away E're he could Farewell to his Champions say. His Head cut off, his Army is Perplext, Wine had the conquest first, and Judith next. SUSANNA and the ELDERS. A pair of Elders Grave, at Noon day light, In private, put Susanna into a fright: The Garden Doors shut, and her Maides away, Who should the fair Susanna share but they? Youth runs the risque, if strength of Nature fail 'Tis time our past offences to bewail. BEL and the DRAGON. Cyrus, a Persian Monarch stands in fear, And serves a Dragon, choakt with Pitch &amp; Hair; The like to Bel; whom when they offer Meat, What He can't do, his Priests make bold to Eat. Self-interest first the World fals Dictates gave, Men easily believe what they would have. I. MACCABEES. The ZEALOUS GENERAL. Brave Mattathias feelingly bemoans Jerusalem, with deepest Sighs and Groans, Slaies an Idolater, and at his Fall Leaves Maccabeus Captain General. The latest kindness we the Truth can do, Is for it Nobly Death to undergo. The CONCERN at STAKE. Stern Apollonius at a loss for Forces, The Gentiles furnish him with Men and Horses: Now Israel's concern lay at the Stake 'Til Maccabeus the complotments brake. If to the Test Mans cause with Gods be brought, All Human Machinations come to nought. The OPPRESSOR. Antiochus the Tyrant, makes Confession, And dying tells the World of his Oppression: Whose Son, though kinder than his Father found, Yet Sions Walls are levell'd with the Ground. When for our Selves, we work with all our Heart, But when we Act for God, we Act in part. The COMPETITORS. Demetrius waging War with Alexander, Nor brooking to be thought a worse Commander, Is slain; God Dagon and his Temple Burn Together, and may serve to fill one Urn. A Molten Image dignified with Dross Should be Refin'd, though to the makers Loss. II. MACCABEES. VINDICTIVE JUSTICE Heliodorus sent to bear away The Treasure of a Temple for a Prey, Is paw'd to th' Earth; two Angels him Chastise, And make him feel the Smart before he Dies. The Sacrilegious Person is a Thief, To whom nor Law nor Gospel grants Relief. The ECLIPS. The People of Jerusalem behold Prognostick Signs, which were by Heav'n foretold, Antiochus his rage is read i'th' Skies, Though scarce discernible for Prodigies. Where Provocation moves, the angry Stars Are kind to make known Famine, Plague, or Wars. The UNDAUNTED MATRON. A Matron and Seven Children are destroy'd, For not committing what they would avoid, By tasting Swines Flesh; for when Mortal Eats, 'Tis Faith makes lawful, or unlawful Meats. Who in his Bosom Right has for a Friend, May Heaven-ward with the best assurance tend. The RUNNAGATE in SCARCENESS. Antiochus (whom the great Heart Searcher knew Implacable against the worsted Jew) Dies in a strang Land, Loathsom, Fear'd by many, But, his Name rotting, not desir'd by any. Extremity of want attends on all That Fight against the Church, and wish her Fall. The DISCOMFITURE. To persecute the Jews, Timotheus draws His Men of War up, to maintain his cause, But valiant Maccabeus drawing nigh, Smites Thirty Thousand of them Hip and Thigh. If Ambiguities in Fighting lurk, 'Tis the concluding stroke that Crowns the Work. Finis. Vet. Test.</field>

The GENEALOGIE. An Angel to good Joseph makes appear; The time of the Messias drawing near, Whose Genealogie in a streight line With Blood of Kings and Prophets does combine. That God-head should with Man-hood so unite, Makes Angels not to equal Man in height. The EPIPHANIE. Kings of the East, Three Magi, come from far Directed to their Saviour by a Star: Each from his Treasure choicest Presents brings, To the great Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Gold, with Arabian Aromatique Gum, An Offering to the great High Priest that's come. The ESCAPE. The Mother of the propitious High-born Child, The Virgin over-shadowed, undefil'd, Must with her Infant fly; O our defence, Thy Favour, and thy Love are most Immense! Who for the whole World was a Ransom meant Betimes from Judah is to Egypt sent. The INNOCENTS MASSACRED. A Tragick Scene, Bethlehem with Infants strew'd, Proud Herods guards with Milk and Blood embrew'd; Yet, Rachel, let this news just grief asswage, Thy Heav'n-born Royal Babe has scap'd their rage. Had they compleated their severe intent. Christs Blood, by Man, for Man had not bin spent. BAPTISM INSTITUTED. Christ Holy Ordinances to maintain, The Sacrament of Water doth Ordain; His Son Baptiz'd God by a voice approves, Whom for himself, in whom he Man-kind loves. Sprinkling Regeneration must precede (For all of us in Trespasses are Dead.) The SOPHISTER. Christ, in the Desart, the sly Tempter finds, (When Solitary we must guard our minds) To knowledg in the Scripture he pretends, And Quotes it too, but for his own fals ends. Prince of the Air, turn'd Minister of Light, Knows how to screw his notions to the Height. The ORTHODOX TEACHER. Christ's Sermon speaks his Kingdom, who Inherit, The Meek, the Merciful, the Poor in Spirit: How sacred Pastors are, learn by this Sign, Divinity it self is a Divine. Tremendous charge! the Souls Christ did redeem Are to his Priests committed all by him! The BUSIE BODY. Our Brothers Faults we are too prone to note, Make Mole-hills Mountains, magnifie a Mote; Betwixt both parties then in open light, The partial Microscope is not held right. Who gives Reproof and yet Obnoxious stands, May Quarel, but has reason to Shake Hands. The INDULGENT MASTER. The Servant of a good Centurian sick, To find a Remedy his Master's quick: Acted by Faith, by which the Cure is wrought, (But we are sav'd by Faith our Selves have got.) Who has of all Physicians found the best Let him believe, and set his Heart at rest. The STORME. The Roaring Billows swell, a Tenth Wave roles A First a Second, Second Third controles; Faith staggers with the Man, by fear opprest, Nor can be found in an Apostles Breast. Euroclydon may rage, 'till Courage fails, But who makes Christ his Pilot safely Sails. The PARALYTICK. A weak and feeble Wretch upon a Bed, Unable to uphold his shakeing Head, Get's up, walkes, and the Bed on which he lay, By Christs commanding strengthned, bears away. Such Miracles our Lord was pleas'd to shew In whom all Power to whom all Praise is due. The HUSBAND-MAN. A Sower at his lawful Calling, Sows, And leaves to Providence what of it grows: The Thorny, Stony, with the High-way ground, Are such on which no Crop will e're be found. Planting and Watering may together cease If the Almighty give not an Encrease. The EXECUTIONER. Herodias tax'd with her Incestuous Bed, Resolves to Dance off St. John Baptist's Head: The Trunkless Prophet in a Charger lies, Mother and Daughter glut their greedy Eyes. When Resolutions hold to Act with Shame, Unlawful Lust breaks out into a Flame. The WEAK ENDEAVOUR. Ship and Disciples tost upon the Main, Christ, to their rescue, Walks the liquid Plain, Peter attempts too, at his Lords command, But sinks, unless supported by his Hand. Peter the Rock on whom Christ's Church was Built, Did herein shew a Frailty, not a Guilt. The REPARTY. A Heathen suing for her Child possest, Slighted, then as a Dog, from Bread represt; Yea, the Dogs, answers, Gather Crumms up Lord; Christ doth her Faith extoll, her Suit accord. Humility hath Exaltation found, When Pride and Self-conceit are cast to th' ground. The TRANSFIGURATION. Christ, to assure them of their Future state, Lets Peter, James and John Anticipate, Yet but a Glimps, at which Elias staies With Moses to behold his brighter rayes. In highest Heav'n the whole we shall Possess, Here an excess of Glory might Oppress. The WORLDLING. Babes, as uncapable of doing Harms, Our Saviour Christ, embraceth in his Arms; The Rich man asks the way to Heaven, indeed, But Mony, thinks he, stands me in better stead. Leave all, and follow! hard sentence! worldly wise Mind not, to Covet is to Idolize. The HIRELINGS. The Labourers in the Vineyard, these a Day Those the last Hour, are equall'd in their Pay; Nor may we murmur, but admire Gods will, Gratious and just, who can do nothing ill. To cut the Hireling short, is to deceive, But who can blame if Over-plus we give? The ADVENT. Christ in Humility rides on an Ass, All shout Hosanna, and bestrew the Pass: The Buyers in the Temple are whip't out, And made to heard abroad with their own Rout. Due Reverence to the Church must not be lost, Man is the Temple of the Holy Ghost. The INTRUDER. A Nuptial Table spread, while those admire The Princely Banquet, these the Guests attire, One without Decent Garment is condemn'd To Manacles, the Wedding so contemn'd. What preparation can be thought too great When Christ the Bridegroom, &amp; his Bride are met? The BANKRUPT. A Rich Man setting out, not to come back In hast, resolves a Thrifty course to take; Talents this Man has Five, that Two, this One, And he that hides that Talent must have none. Assiduous Management with Diligence, Brings with it the contenting Recompence. The GRAND ASSIZE. When Christ shall be attended to his Throne, And Sublunary Pomps all past and gone, The Sheep are to be set at his Right Hand, But the Lascivious Goats at his Left stand. Then a Discrimination will be made, No Subterfuge, no Corner, to evade. The EUCHARIST. Before his Passion, his Disciples set, The Sacrament partake, first having Eat The Pascal Lamb: O happy there St. John, To have his Masters Breast to stay upon! Though he had Honour to be next his side, Communion of all Saints is here imply'd. The CONSPIRACIE. The Rulers, and chief Governours, conspire How to accomplish their accurst desire: When once it comes to this, one must betray, The rest of his Disciples fall away. Adversity a Touch-Stone is to prove Stability distinct from common Love. The ARRAIGNMENT. A Court of Justice summon'd, Christ Arraign'd, The People throng, nor will they be restrain'd: Though Pilat wash, and no fault in him spy, Yet Barabbas is sav'd, and Christ must die. He that fore-warn'd fals Sentence dares Pronounce, Is Judge, and Executioner at once. The CRUCIFIXTION. The Unrighteous Sentence past, without releif Christ hangs betwixt one, and an other Theif: Darkness, Vail rent, Graves open, Dead arise, And the whole frame of Nature a disguise. Infinity confin'd, and God-man dead, The Fainter light well might obscure his Head. The RESURRECTION. An Earth-quake still the Angel to make known The Resurrection, roles away the Stone: Mary with the Eleven beholds the Lord, Who sends them far and wide to Preach the Word. The Gospel promulgation cries Repent; The End for which the Son of Man was sent. S?. MARK. The HERMET. Judah's Triumphant Lion is set out By him whose Emblem is the Lion stout: St. John the Baptist clad in Camels Hair As Messenger his way is to prepare. The question put art thou the Christ or no? He told the truth, and Sufferd for it too. The INDECORUM. Christ with an holy Indignation Burns, And Mony-changers Tables overturns: His House is set apart to hear the Word, No Burthen must come there, but of the Lord. Where Heav'n has the peculiar claim and right To Marchandize is doing it despite. S?. LUKE. The THREE PROPHESIES. St. Luke, Himself presenting with an Ox, The Incarnation Mysterie unlocks; What was before the Worlds Creation laid, Here Gods determinations are obey'd. Elizabeth and Mary's Prophesies Concerning Christ are joyn'd with Zacharies. The SALUTATION. Hail, full of Grace! The Book before thee tells Thy Heart is fixt on Heaven, and nothing else: Blessed art Thou, and blessed is thy Womb, From whence a Man-child, without man, can come. Wonder of Wonders! so exceeding deep, Angels dare only gently into it peep. The NEGLECTED GUESTS. Joseph, to pay his Tax, to Bethlehem tends, With Mary espous'd, and when their journy ends They put into an Inn, where Christ is Born, No Grandure, Stable-manger serves the turn. Magnificence and State are for the great; He came to put the mighty from their seat. The ANTHEM. An Angel makes the harmless Shepheards know, The look't for Prince of Peace was here below: A Chorus Hallelujah heard to sing To Lion, and to Lamb, to Priest and King. That for us lost, Himself thus God should give, Simplicity of Heart did first believe. The CIRCUMCISION. The Eight day come, the tender Childs content To feel the Circumcising Instrument: How kindly with us has the Father dealt? The word was made Flesh, and amongst us dwelt. Who any thing Unclean did never know Did this for us, Polluted, undergo. The EXTASIE. Good aged Simeon, over-joyed, takes up The strength of Jacob, and all Israels hope: Depart in Peace was here the fittest Theme, He first held Christ in's Arms, now Christ holds Him. Extatique Exultation doth him seize, This life a Prison now, Death a Release. The YOUNG REPLICANT. The Pharisaick Doctors Christ confutes With Cogent Arguments, in Sharp Disputes; Answers Objections, when they put him any, Yet Beggs no question, though he ask them many. Who should Discourse a point, or handle right, But he in whom all knowledge was and might? VIRBIUS. A Widdows onely Son at Naim dead, After the Bier the weeping Mother's led; The Bearers stop; a-rise, when Christ had spoke, His Soul returns; the Bands of Death are broke. He that Restorer was to be of all, A Single one for instance does recall. The CONTRITE HEART. A Pharisee Christ at a Dinner treats, Where Mary Magdalen staies while he eats, Half drown'd in Tears; her penitent behaviour Gains her offences pardon from our Saviour. A broken Contrite Heart, with swolen Eyes, The God of Mercy never will despise. The WAY-FARING MAN. A Traveller has unlucky chance to fall Into Theives hands, who rifle him of all, And wound him; many passing by, at length A good Samaritan repaires his strength. To have no Sympathizing for distress Humanity it self is to suppress. The REPROOF. Martha and Mary (Sisters) disagree In stating wherein lies Felicity: Martha is cumbred with the Worlds affairs, Mary to Heavenly matters gives her cares. Nature contented is with little Food, Nothing too much for our Eternal good. The ORACLE. The Worlds Redeemer from the Devils Snares, (Who ready stands to catch men unawars) Casts out a Dumb one; for if Christ command, Legion nor Beelzebub his word withstand. That Oracle was not Dumb which spake out plain (Without a Trope) the Hebrew Child will Reign. The BAD FORE-CASTER. A Scraping Miser casts about to encrease His stock of Worldly wealth, and live at ease: His Granaries too Scanty, and Barnes too Small, But Mute he stands told whether he must fall. When we possess what ever Heart desires A little Room will serve when breath expires. The SPEND-THRIFT. A Profuse Upstart spends what e're he had, And then considers that his case was bad: Making Acknowledgment in's own behalf His Father Feasts him with the fatted Calf. Abhorrence of a Misdemeanure past Gains pitty, and forgivness at the last. The BELLY-GOD. A Pamper'd Wretch, that Rob'd each Element To give his Craving Appetite content, Less kind then Dogs to Lazarus at's Door, Wants Water now, who Swam in Wine before. Small Satisfaction in excess is found, We are most uneasy, when we most abound. The GOOD PHYSICIAN. Ten Lepers cleans'd from their Impurities, By Christs true Magisterial remedies, One of all these, with thanks returns alone, That Men have grateful Hearts 'tis ten to one! Who so unworthy is as not to own A Courtesie, should have no future done. The SEPARATIST A Pharisee, with Stentorian voice, and motion, Out-words the Publican at his Devotion; Who smiting's Breast is justified, we are Neither to be Presumptuous, nor Despair. Humility will purchase a good Name, When Ostentation must draw off with shame. The IMPORTUNATE BEGGAR. A Blind man, understanding Christ was nigh, Is heard once and again aloud to Cry, Ah mercy, mercy, Lord, mercy, he saith, His Eyes restor'd are, for his Eye of Faith. Reiterated Supplications move So Strongly, a Good man cannot chuse but love. The ACTIVE PUBLICAN. A Publican, Diminutive for Height, Out-runs the rest, to have of Christ a sight; And Heaven-ward gets by climbing up a Tree, That him who brought Salvation he might see. Christ dines with him: be he a Publican, Alms and just Deeds make the accepted Man. The AGONY. Christ, with submission to his Fathers will, (Which he was alwaies ready to fulfill) Beggs that the Cup might pass, of Dregs brim full, O how had then our Sins been White as Wool! Even when his Soul with grief was sore opprest Thy Will be done on Earth, was his request. The SPIRITUAL TOUCH-STONE. For Sins of Deepest Die, and Crimson hue Who calls to mind Christ spit on by a Jew, Bearing that Cross from whence a Theif is freed And not his own Heart feel (if Flesh) to bleed? So to the Shambles is the dumb Sheep brought As was the Shepheard here, who us has bought. The APPARITION. After his Resurrection Christ is seen By two that his Disciples long had been; They know him not, and ther's good reason why, They did ill-know him when he was to Die. Few are contented to partake in Woes, Self-interest will to it self stick close. The EXALTATION. All now Fulfill'd, and the Great Ransom paid, (Each individual Man hath disobey'd) When as the Comforter was to be sent, Christ blessing his, ascend's the Firmament. When Way, and Truth, and Life are fled and gone, He that the Spirit has, is not alone. S?. JOHN. BOANERGES. St. John the choice Disciple, though he Write The last of all the Evangelists, his flight Soar's high, whose Raptures are so to excess, That nothing but an Eagle can express; Whose Wing, the Writer with a Pen supplies, To Treat of nothing but Sublimities. The WEDDING. A Wedding Solemniz'd where many Dine, Christ works a wonder, and makes Water Wine: Wine at a nuptial Feast is best allow'd, To clear an Aspect, and expell a Cloud. They had been less astonish'd then they were, Had they regarded the True Vine was there. The QUERIST Christ, holding talk with Nicodemus, finds Our knowledge shallow is, and dark our minds: Mans everlasting welfare, and true good, Is not by sense and reason understood. We blinded are, and walk as in a maze, Illumination is a spark of Grace. The OPPORTUNITY. A Woman, (a Samaritan by Nation) Near Jacobs Well, finds (to her admiration) A Well of Life, and learns her Creed in brief From him, who was of all Instructers Chief. He that could tell her all that she had done, Was a sufficient Ground to build upon, The MIRACLE. Five Thousand Hungry Souls! Compassion moves, Christ feeds them with Two Fishes and Five Loaves: They'd make him King, t' extreames the Vulgar start, Fill but their Belly, and you have their Heart. Omnipotence no limits has, no stop, To whom all things are as the Buckets drop. The LEGISLATORS COMPAR'D. One of the Weaker Sex, is caught i'th' Act, Christ spares the Woman, but Reproves the Fact, Moses Condemns Her, but that Law must cease That Thundering came, Christ's Gospel is of Peace. If Heav'n should Strike as oft as we Offend, The Sinful World would soon be at an end. The EARNEST. Lazarus laid under Ground, at his long Home, Commanded to Arise comes out of's Tomb: This was too hard for Mortal Man to do, But he that Rais'd Himself can Raise Us too. Such Energie proceeds from Power Divine, From him who doth with's Fathers Brightness Shine. The TRAYTOR. The Traytor Judas (pre-design'd to this) Betraies his Lord and Master with a Kiss, Peter (not alwaies so Couragious,) here Fights, and sends Malchus from him with one Ear. Under pretence of Friend-ship to betray, Is to be fals the most Notorious way. The GRAND EXEMPLAR. Jesus our Saviour! Christ our Righteousness! How did our Weight of Sin thy Soul oppress? Since then our Scourgings upon thee were spent, Thy Church while Militant, must be content. No Sorrow like to this, no Pain so great, For us those drops of Blood did Jesus sweat. The RANSOM. Clad in a Purple Robe (to cause Derision) Christ bears his Crown of Thornes with meek submission Let him be Crucified while they Cry out The Magistrate is govern'd by the Rout. So when a Breach is made the Torrent gains Upon the Neigh-bouring Banks and drowns the Plains. The ASSURANCE. Arimathea's Joseph has regard To the sure recompence of the reward; And therefore decently he Christ Interr's With whom he is to Reign above the Spheres. Duty perform'd with Love in manner fit Has a Remuneration follow it. ACTS. The MISSION. Christs Farewell promise of the Holy Ghost To his, now like a Ship with Tempests tost, Is here made good: the Spirit Utterance gives, This Man rejects the Gospel, that believes. The way to our Salvation is abus'd When Life is set before us and refus'd. The HEAVENLY ALMONERS. An Impotent Poor Cripple at the Gate O'th' Temple, askes an Alms, as there he sate: Peter replys, Mony I seldom see, 'I th' Name of Christ I give thy Leggs to thee. Who gives what he is Able to bestow, Shall for the Will and Gift accepted go. The HYPOCRITE. A Compact made by two starch't Hypocrites To keep the Church bare, and with-hold her Rights: Trust not a Brother; there were ever they, That put their Nay for Yea, and Yea for Nay. Deceit effected through Hypocrisie, Is to call God to witness to a Lye. The BEATIFICAL VISION. The Sanction of the Law set up by Moses, Fore-told by Christ, who no such Yoak imposes, St. Stephen proving past, and of no force, They Stone, upon his Knees, without remorse. Beholding Christ stand ready to receive, The Proto-martyr took a joyful leave. The PROSELYTE An Ethiopian Eunuch, meanly fraught With Literature, is to St. Philip brought, And made a Proselyte of Christ; however 'Tis better be a Christian late then never. While we the Law endeavour to fulfill Conversion is not in our Choyse, or Will. The CONSTERNATION. Saul going to Damascus, is struck down, And in a dreadful manner told his own: Saul, Jesus Cries, dost Persecute me Saul? Yes, Lord, but Die'd for thee, when he was Paul. O Depth of goodness! here with Kind constraint, The Chief of Sinners made the Chiefest Saint The DREAM. Cornelius, to inform himself the better Which was the true Religion, sends for Peter: Who in a Dream is told what God would do Not for the Jew alone, but Gentile too. No Industry too great, no Labour lost To learn what will at last advantage most. The RELEASE. St. James Cut off at Cruel Herods word, St. Peter next is Destin'd to the Sword; But Praier guards him from Persecutions Storms, And the Proud Wretch is eaten up with Worms. Gods Glory taken to himself Prophane, His Rhetorique proves his Fall, his Tongue his Bane. The STOUT CHRISTIAN. The Fiery Tryal grown exceeding hot, And all Compassion lost, or quite forgot, St. Paul at Lystra is resolv'd to stay, To make a Cripple throw his Crutch away. A good cause Perseverance propagates, And fear of what may do us Harm, abates. The SHIP-WRACK. The World is but an Inn, best Friends must part, And this was Pauls case, though with heavy Heart: Rocks, Quick-sands, Gulfes, Waves dashing o're and o're, Yet all well though a Serpent on the Shore. To settle upon Earth we purpose wrong, A Tabernacle has no Durance long. REVELATIONS. The PERFECT NUMBER. Seven Candlesticks Sev'n Churches represent, By being of pure Gold, the truth is meant: Those Asiatick Hieroglyphicks gain. Belief in such as own that Christ does Reign. Types may of Heav'n here some faint Shadows bear, We shall view things hereafter as they are. The THRONE. If Eye and Ear, their Organs have too Weak To See or Hear, how should the Tongue then speak The bliss that Saints enjoy? or how St. John Give us a definition of the Throne? So when the Worlds Eye is most clear and bright, Ours fail, as dazeled by too strong a light. The JOY UNSPEAKABLE. Conquest, War Plenty, Death, on Horse back sit, And all things pass away when Christ thinks fit: Joys Sublunary fade, all Worldly things Must be dissolv'd when He his Summons brings. Occult and Seal'd up Sins will then lie bare, Thrice happy they that in the Lamb have share. The ATTONEMENT. Seven Seals, Sev'n Trumpets, and Sev'n Angels, note Plagues pour'd from Viols with Gods vengeance hot; But one with Incense on the Altar laid Makes an Attonement that they might be staid. Gods attribute of Mercy most is seen, When Justice has her Sword drawn out, and keen. The APOSTATE. Proud Lucifer when the Fifth Trumpet sounds, Is hurl'd down with such force that he rebounds: Thus that Apostatizeing Angel fell, (From highest Heav'n to the profoundest Hell.) To him the Keyes of it are due, for Tophet The Wicked share, be they King, Priest, or Prophet. ETERNITY. Behold an Angel with a Book in's hand, Prepar'd to Cut off Time, at Gods Command: St. John receives the Book, and bid to Eat, What few their Study make, he makes his Meat. How ought we then Good Works to lay in store? Man must survive when Time shall be no more. The WITNESSES. Two Witnesses, in Scarlet, Prophesie, And by the Beast are both Condemn'd to Die: Inveterate Malice opposition makes, (And what it knows Destructive, undertakes.) Where lies the conquest 'tis not hard to tell, Sure they that Conquer Death it self, excell. The PRODIGIES. St. John beholds a Beast rise from the Main (The like to which none shall behold again) With Seven Heads, and Ten Hornes; an other birth As monstrous from the center of the Earth. No formidable Creatures so deterr The Chosen, but at last they banish fear. The SPIRITS. The Ministring Spirits act, if God direct, In order to the good of his Elect: Vessels of Wrath upon their Foes are pour'd, By which his Majesty's the more ador'd. Had Virtue no Reward, no Torture Sin, Man of all Creatures better nere had bin. The ANTICHRIST. Imperious Babylon here her down-fall takes, And Universal Monarchy now shakes; The Cup of Trembling makes her Grandees faint, But this is Satisfaction to the Saint. The Sentence past, no hope of a Reprieve; They gnash (too late) at what they must beleive. The DOOM. The Devil for a Thousand Years in's Chain, Was to be set at's liberty again, But grown Out-ragious that his time was short, Return he must to his Infernal Court. Privation of that bliss the Righteous have, Add's Torment to the Doom, God Satan gave. The IMMARCESCIBLE CROWN. The New Jerusalem, that City above, Where nothing dwell's but Purity, and Love, Need's not the Lamp with which we first begun Our bold attempt; Gods Glory Exceeds the Sun. Ineffable Contentment grief expels He being ours in whom all fulness dwells. Finis Novi Test.</field>
