      <field name="fulltext">THE TEARES OF PEACE. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows:For Pea. read Peace For Int. read Interlo. Indvctio. Now that our Soueraign, the great King of Peace, Hath (in her grace) outlabour'd Hercules; And, past his Pillars, stretcht her victories; Since (as he were sole Soule, t'all Royalties) He moues all Kings, in this vast Vniuerse, To cast chaste Nettes, on th' impious lust of Mars; See, All; and imitate his goodnesse still; That (hauing cleard so well, warres outward ill) Hee, God-like, still employes his firme desires, To cast learn'd ynke vpon those inwarde fires, That kindle worse Warre, in the mindes of men, Like to incense the outward Warre againe: Selfe-loue, inflaming so, mens sensuall bloud, That all good, publique, drownes in priuate good; And that, sinks vnder, his owne ouer-freight; Mens Reasons, and their Learnings, shipwrackt quite; And their Religion, that should still be One, Takes shapes so many, that most know't in none. Which, I admiring (since, in each man shinde A light so cleere, that by it, all might finde (Being well informd) their obiect perfect Peace, Which keepes the narrow path to Happinesse) In that discourse; I shund, (as is my vse) The iarring preace, and all their times abuse; T'enioy least trodden fieldes, and fre'est shades; Wherein (of all the pleasure that inuades The life of man, and flies all vulgar feet, Since silent meditation is most sweet) I sat to it; discoursing what maine want So ransackt man; that it did quite supplant The inward Peace I spake of; letting in (At his loose veines) sad warre, and all his sinne. When, sodainely, a comfortable light Brake through the shade; and, after it, the sight Of a most graue, and goodly person shinde; With eys turnd vpwards, &amp; was outward, blind; But, inward; past, and future things, he sawe; And was to both, and present times, their lawe. His sacred bosome was so full of fire, That t'was transparent; and made him expire His breath in flames, that did instruct (me thought) And (as my soule were then at full) they wrought. At which, I casting downe my humble eyes, Not daring to attempt their feruencies; He thus bespake me; Deare minde, do not feare My strange apparance; Now t'is time t'outweare Thy bashfull disposition, and put on As confident a countnance, as the Sunne. For what hast thou to looke on, more diuine, And horrid, then man is; as hee should shine, And as he doth? what, free'd from this worlds strife; What he is entring; and what, ending life? All which, thou onely studiest, and dost knowe; And, more then which, is onely sought for showe. Thou must not vnderualue what thou hast, In weighing it with that, which more is grac't; The worth that weigheth inward, should not long For outward prices. This should make thee strong In thy close value; Nought so good can be As that which lasts good, betwixt God, and thee. Remember thine owne verse—Should Heauen turn Hell, For deedes well done, I would do euer well. This heard, with ioy enough, to breake the twind Of life and soule, so apt to breake as mind; I brake into a trance, and then remainde (Like him) an onely soule; and so obtainde Such bouldnesse, by the sense hee did controule; That I set looke, to looke; and soule to soule. I view'd him at his brightest; though, alas, With all acknowledgement, of what hee was Beyond what I found habited in me; And thus I spake; O thou that (blinde) dost see My hart, and soule; what may I reckon thee? Whose heauenly look showes not; nor voice sounds man? I am (sayd hee) that spirit Elysian, That (in thy natiue ayre; and on the hill Next Hitchins left hand) did thy bosome fill, With such a flood of soule; that thou wert faine (With acclamations of her Rapture then) To vent it, to the Echoes of the vale; When (meditating of me) a sweet gale Brought me vpon thee; and thou didst inherit My true sense (for the time then) in my spirit; And I, inuisiblie, went prompting thee, To those fayre Greenes, where thou didst english me. Scarce he had vttered this, when well I knewe It was my Princes Homer; whose deare viewe Renew'd my gratefull memorie of the grace His Highnesse did me for him: which, in face, Me thought the Spirit show'd, was his delight; And added glory to his heauenly plight: Who tould me, he brought stay to all my state; That hee was Angell to me; Starre, and Fate; Aduancing Colours of good hope to me; And tould me, my retired age should see Heauens blessing, in a free, and harmelesse life, Conduct me, through Earths peace-pretending strife, To that true Peace, whose search I still intend, And to the calme Shore of a loued ende. But now, as I cast round my rauisht eye, To see, if this free Soule had companie; Or that, alone, hee louingly pursude The hidden places of my Solitude; He rent a Cloude downe, with his burning hand That at his backe hung, twixt me, and a Land Neuer inhabited; and sayd; Now, behould What maine defect it is that doth enfould The World, in ominous flatteries of a Peace So full of worse then warre; whose sterne encrease Deuours her issue. With which words, I view'd A Lady, like a Deitie indew'd; (But weeping, like a woman) and made way Out of one Thicket, that sawe neuer day, Towards another; bearing vnderneath Her arme, a Coffine, for some prize of death; And after her (in funerall forme) did goe The woddes foure-footed Beasts, by two, and two; A Male, and Female, matcht, of euerie kinde; And after them; with like instinct enclinde, The ayrie Nation felt her sorrowes stings; Fell on the earth, kept rancke, and hung their wings: Which sight I much did pittie, and admire; And longd to knowe the dame that could inspire Those Bestials, with such humane Forme, and ruthe; And how I now should knowe, the hidden Truthe (As Homer promist) of that maine defect That makes men, all their inward Peace reiect For name of outward: Then hee tooke my hand; Led to her; and would make my selfe demand, (Though he could haue resolv'd me) what shee was? And from what cause, those strange effects had pass? For whom, She bore that Coffine? and so mournd? To all which; with all mildensse, she returnd Aunswere; that she was Peace; sent down from heauen With charge, from the Almightie Deitie giuen, T'attend on men; who now had banisht her From their societies, and made her erre In that wilde desert; onely Humane loue (Banisht in like sort) did a long time proue That life with her; but now, alas, was dead, And lay in that wood to bee buried; For whom she bore that Coffine, and did mourne; And that those Beasts were so much humane, borne, That they, in nature, felt a loue to Peace; For which, they followd her, when men did cease. This went so neere her heart, it left her tongue; And (silent) she gaue time, to note whence sprung Mens want of Peace; which was from want of loue: And I observ'd now, what that peace did proue That men made shift with, &amp; did so much please. For now, the Sunne declining to the Seas, Made long misshapen shadowes; and true Peace (Here walking in his Beames) cast such encrease Of shaddowe from her; that I saw it glide Through Citties, Courts, and Countryes; and descride, How, in her shadowe only, men there liv'd, While shee walkt here ith Sunne: and all that thriv'd Hid in that shade their thrift; nought but her shade Was Bullwarke gainst all warre that might inuade Their Countries, or their Consciences; since Loue (That should giue Peace, her substance) now they droue Into the Deserts; where hee sufferd Fate, And whose sad Funerals Beasts must celebrate. With whom, I freely wisht, I had beene nurst; Because they follow Nature, at their wurst; And at their best, did teach her. As wee went I felt a scruple, which I durst not vent, No not to Peace her selfe, whom it concernd, For feare to wrong her; So well I haue learnd, To shun iniustice, euen to doues, or flies; But, to the Diuell, or the Destinies, Where I am iust, and knowe I honour Truth, Ile speake my thoughts, in scorne of what ensu'th. Yet (not resolv'd in th' other) there did shine A Beame of Homers fre'er soule, in mine, That made me see, I might propose my doubt; Which was; If this were true Peace I found out, That felt such passion? I prov'd her sad part; And prayd her call, her voice out of her hart (There, kept a wrongfull prisoner to her woe) To answere, why shee was afflicted so. Or how, in her, such contraries could fall; That taught all ioy, and was the life of all? Shee aunswered; Homer tould me that there are Passions, in which corruption hath no share; There is a ioy of soule; and why not then A griefe of soule, that is no skathe to men? For both are Passions, though not such as raigne In blood, and humor, that engender paine. Free sufferance for the truth, makes sorrow sing, And mourning farre more sweet, then banqueting. Good, that deserueth ioy (receiuing ill) Doth merit iustly, as much sorrow still: And is it a corruption to do right? Griefe, that dischargeth Conscience, is delight: One sets the other off. To stand at gaze In one position, is a stupide maze, Fit for a Statue. This resolv'd me well, That Griefe, in Peace, and Peace in Griefe might dwell. And now fell all things from their naturall Birth: Passion in Heauen; Stupiditie, in Earth, Inuerted all; the Muses, Vertues, Graces, Now sufferd rude, and miserable chaces From mens societies, to that desert heath; And after them, Religion (chac't by death) Came weeping, bleeding to the Funerall: Sought her deare Mother Peace; and downe did fall, Before her, fainting, on her horned knees; Turnd horne, with praying for the miseries She left the world in; desperate in their sinne; Marble, her knees pearc't; but heauen could not winne To stay the weightie ruine of his Glorie In her sad Exile; all the memorie Of heauen, and heauenly things, rac't of all hands; Heauen moues so farre off, that men say it stands; And Earth is turnd the true, and mouing Heauen; And so tis left; and so is all Truth driuen From her false bosome; all is left alone, Till all bee orderd with confusion. Thus the poore broode of Peace; driuen, &amp; distrest, Lay brooded all beneath their mothers breast; Who fell vpon them weeping, as they fell: All were so pinde, that she containde them well. And in this Chaos, the digestion And beautie of the world, lay thrust and throwne. In this deiection, Peace pourd out her Teares, Worded (with some pause) in my wounded Eares. JNVOCATIO. O ye three-times-thrice sacred Quiristers, Of Gods great Temple; the small Vniuerse Of ruinous man: (thus prostrate as ye lye Brooded, and Loded with Calamitie, Contempt, and shame, in your true mother, Peace) As you make sad my soule, with your misease: So make her able fitly to disperse Your sadnesse, and her owne, in sadder verse. Now (olde, and freely banisht with yourselues From mens societies; as from rockes, and shelues) Helpe me to sing, and die, on our Thames shore; And let her lend me, her waues to deplore (In yours, and your most holy Sisters falls) Heauens fall, and humane Loues, last funeralls. And thou, great Prince of men; let thy sweete graces Shine on these teares; and drie, at length, the faces Of Peace, and all her heauen-allyed brood; From whose Doues eyes, is shed the precious blood Of Heauens deare Lamb, that freshly bleeds in them. Make these no toyes then; gird the Diadem Of thrice great Britaine, with their Palm and Bayes: And with thy Eagles feathers, daigne to raise The heauie body of my humble Muse; That thy great Homers spirit in her may vse Her topless flight, and beare thy Fame aboue The reach of Mortalls, and their earthy loue; To that high honour, his Achilles wonne, And make thy glory farre out-shine the Sunne. While this small time gaue Peace (in her kinde Throes) Vent for the violence of her sodaine woes; She turnd on her right side, and (leaning on Her tragique daughters bosome) lookt vpon My heauy lookes, drownd in imploring teares For her, and that so wrongd deare Race of hers. At which, euen Peace, exprest a kinde of Spleene. And, as a carefull Mother, I haue seene Chide her lov'd Childe, snatcht with som feare from danger: So Peace chid me; and first shed teares of anger. The Teares of Peace. Peace. Thou wretched man, whome I discouer, borne To want, and sorrowe, and the Vulgars scorne: Why haunt'st thou freely, these vnhaunted places, Emptie of pleasures? empty of all Graces, Fashions, and Riches; by the best pursude With broken Sleepe, Toyle, Loue, Zeale, Seruitude; With feare and trembling, with whole liues, and Soules? While thou break'st sleepes, digst vnder Earth, like moules, To liue, to seeke me out, whome all men fly: And think'st to finde, light in obscuritie, Eternitie, in this deepe vale of death: Look'st euer vpwards, and liu'st still beneath; Fill'st all thy actions, with strife, what to thinke, Thy Braine with Ayre, and skatterstit in inke: Of which thou mak'st weeds for thy soule to weare, As out of fashion, as the bodies are. Interlo. I grant their strangenesse, and their too ill grace, And too much wretchednesse, to beare the face Or any likenesse of my soule in them: Whose Instruments, I rue with many a Streame Of secret Teares for their extream defects, In vttering her true forms: but their respects Need not be less'ned, for their being strange, Or not so vulgar, as the rest that range With headlong Raptures, through the multitude: Of whom they get grace, for their being rude. Nought is so shund by Virtue, throwne from Truth, As that which drawes the vulgar Dames, and Youth. Pea. Truth must confesse it: for where liues there one, That Truth or Vertue, for themselues alone, Or seekes, or not contemns? All, all pursue Wealth, Glory, Greatnesse, Pleasure, Fashions new. Who studies, studies these: who studies not And sees that studie, layes the vulgar Plot; That all the Learning he gets liuing by, Men but for forme, or humour dignifie (As himselfe studies, but for forme, and showe, And neuer makes his speciall end, to knowe) And that an idle, ayrie man of Newes, A standing Face; a propertie to vse In all things vile, makes Booke-wormes, creepe to him: How scorns he bookes, and booke-worms! O how dim Burnes a true Soules light, in his Bastard eyes! And, as a Forrest ouer-grow'n breedes Flyes, Todes, Adders, Sauadges, that all men shunne; When, on the South-side, in a fresh May Sunne, In varied Heards, the Beasts lie out, and sleepe, The busie Gnatts, in swarms a buzzing keepe, And guild their empty bodies (lift aloft) In beames, that though they see all, difference nought: So, in mens meerly outward, and false Peace, Insteade of polisht men, and true encrease, She brings forth men, with vices ouer-growne: Women, so light, and like, fewe knowe their owne: For milde and humane tongues, tongues forkt that sting: And all these (while they may) take Sunne, and spring, To help them sleep, and florish: on whose beames, And branches, vp they clime, in such extreams Of proude confusion, from iust Lawes so farre, That in their Peace, the long Robe sweeps like warre; Int. That Robe serues great men: why are great so rude, Since great, and meane, are all but multitude? Pea. For regular Learning, that should difference set Twixt all mens worths, and make the meane, or great, As that is meane or great (or chiefe stroke strike) Serues the Plebeian and the Lord alike. Their obiects, showe their learnings are all one; Their liues, their obiects; Learning lov'd by none. Int. You meane, for most part: nor would it displease That most part, if they heard; since they professe, Contempt of learning: Nor esteeme it fit, Noblesse should study, see, or count'nance it. Pea. Can men in blood be Noble, not in soule? Reason abhorres it; since what doth controule The rudenesse of the blood, and makes it Noble (Or hath chiefe meanes, high birth-right to redouble, In making manners soft, and man-like milde, Not suffering humanes to runne proude, or wilde) Is Soule, and learning; (or in loue, or act) In blood where both faile then, lyes Nobless wrackt, Interlo. It cannot be denyde: but could you proue, As well, that th' act of learning, or the loue, (Loue being the act in will) should difference set, Twixt all mens worths, and make the meane or great, As learning is, or great, or meane in them; Then cleare, her Right, stood to mans Diadem, Pea. To proue that Learning (the soules actuall frame; Without which, tis a blanke; a smoke-hid flame) Should sit great Arbitresse, of all things donne, And in your soules, (like Gnomons in the Sunne) Giue Rules to all the circles of your liues. I proue it, by the Regiment God giues To man, of all things; to the soule, of man; To Learning, of the Soule. If then it can Rule, liue; of all things best, is it not best? O who, what god makes greatest, dares make least? But, to vse their tearms; Life is Roote and Crest To all mans Cote of Nobless; his soule is, Field to that Cote; and learning differences All his degrees in honour, being the Cote. Simi. And as a Statuarie, hauing got An Alablaster, bigge enough to cut A humane image in: till he hath put His tooles, and art to it; hew'n, formd, left none Of the redundant matter in the Stone; It beares the image of man, no more, Then of a Woolf, a Cammell, or a Boare: So when the Soule is to the body giuen; (Being substance of Gods Image, sent from heaven) It is not his true Image, till it take Into the Substance, those fit forms that make His perfect Image; which are then imprest By Learning and impulsion; that inuest Man with Gods forme in liuing Holinesse, By cutting from his Body the excesse Of Humors, perturbations and Affects; Which Nature (without Art) no more eiects, Then without tooles, a naked Artizan Can, in rude stone, cut th' Image of a man. Int. How then do Ignorants? who, oft, we trie, Rule perturbations, liue more humanely Then men held learnd? Pea. Who are not learn'd indeed; More then a house fram'd loose, (that still doth neede The haling vp, and ioyning) is a house: Nor can you call, men meere Religious, (That haue good-wills, to knowledge) Ignorant; For, virtuous knowledge hath two waies to plant; By Powre infus'd, and Acquisition; The first of which, those good men, graft vpon; For good life is th' effect, of learnings Act; Which th' action of the minde, did first compact By infusde loue to Learning gainst all ill, Conquests first step, is to all good, the will. Int. If Learning then, in loue or act must be, Meane to good life, and true humanitie; Where are our Scarre-crowes now, or men of ragges, Of Titles meerely, Places, Fortunes, Bragges, That want and scorne both? Those inuerted men? Those dungeons; whose soules no more containe The actuall light of Reason, then darke beasts? Those Cloudes, driuen still, twixt Gods beame and their brests? Those Giants, throwing gould? hils gainst heau?? To no one spice of true humanitie given? Peace. Of men, there are three sorts, that most foes be To Learning and her loue; themselues and me: Actiue, Passiue, and Intellectiue men: Whose selfe-loues; Learning, and her loue disdaine. Your Actiue men, consume their whole lifes fire, In thirst of State-height, higher still and higher, (Like seeled Pigeons) mounting, to make sport, To lower lookers on; in seeing how short They come of that they seeke, and with what trouble; Lamely, and farre from Nature, they redouble Their paines in flying, more then humbler witts, To reach death, more direct. For Death that sits, Vpon the fist of Fate, past highest Ayre, (Since she commands all liues, within that Sphere) The higher men aduance; the neerer findes Her seeled Quarries; when, in bitterest windes, Lightnings, and thunders, and in sharpest hayles Fate casts her off at States; when lower Sayles Slide calmely to their ends. Your Passiue men (So call'd of onely passing time in vaine) Passe it, in no good exercise; but are In meates, and cuppes laborious; and take care To lose without all care their Soule-spent Time; And since they haue no meanes, nor Spirits to clime, Like Fowles of Prey, in any high affaire; See how like Kites they bangle in the Ayre, To stoope at scraps, and garbidge; in respect, Of that which men of true peace should select; And how they trot out, in their liues, the Ring; With idlely iterating oft one thing, A new-fought Combat, an affaire at Sea; A Marriage, or a Progresse, or a Plea. No Newes, but fits them, as if made for them, Though it be forg'd, but of a womans dreame; And stuffe with, such stolne ends, their manlesse breasts, (Sticks, rags, and mud) they seem meer Puttocks nests: Curious in all mens actions, but their owne; All men, and all things censure, though know none. Your Intellectiue men, they study hard Not to get knowledge, but for meere rewarde. And therefore that true knowledge that should be Their studies end, and is in Nature free, Will not be made their Broker; hauing powre (With her sole selfe) to bring both Bride, and dowre. They haue some shadowes of her (as of me, Adulterate outward Peace) but neuer see Her true, and heauenly face. Yet those shades serue (Like errant Knights, that by enchantments swerue, From their true Ladyes being; and embrace An ougly Witch, with her phantastique face) To make them thinke, Truths substance in their arms: Which that they haue not, but her shadowes charmes, See if my proofes, be like their Arguments That leaue Opinion still, her free dissents. They haue not me with them; that all men knowe The highest fruite that doth of knowledge grow; The Bound of all true formes, and onely Act; If they be true, they rest; nor can be rackt Out of their posture, by Times vtmost strength; But last the more of force, the more of length; For they become one substance with the Soule; Which Time with all his adiuncts shall controule. But since, men wilfull may beleeue perchance (In part of Errors two-folde Ignorance, Ill disposition) their skills looke as hie And rest in that diuine Securitie; See if their liues make proofe of such a Peace, For Learnings Truth makes all lifes vain war cease; It making peace with God, and ioines to God; Whose information driues her Period Through all the Bodies passiue Instruments; And by reflection giues them Soule-contents, Besides, from perfect Learning you can neuer Wisedome (with her faire Reigne of Passions) seuer; For Wisdome is nought else, then Learning fin'd, And with the vnderstanding Powre combin'd; That is, a habite of both habits standing; The Bloods vaine humours, euer countermaunding. But, if these showe, more humour then th' vnlearn'd; If in them more vaine passion be discern'd; More mad Ambition; more lust; more deceipt; More showe of golde, then gold; then drosse, less weight; If Flattery, Auarice haue their soules so giuen, Headlong, and with such diuelish furies driuen; That fooles may laugh at their imprudencie, And Villanes blush at their dishonestie; Where is true Learning, proov'd to separate these And seate all forms in her Soules height, in peace? Raging Euripus, that (in all their Pride) Driues Shippes gainst roughest windes, with his fierce Tide, And ebbes and flowes, seuen times in euerie daie; Toyles not on Earth with more irregulare swaye, Nor is more turbulent, and mad then they. And shine; like gould-worms, whom you hardly finde, By their owne, light; not seene; but heard like winde. But this is Learning; To haue skill to throwe Reignes on your bodies powres, that nothing knowe; And fill the soules powers, so with act, and art, That she can curbe the bodies angrie part; All preturbations; all affects that stray From their one obiect; which is to obay Her Soueraigne Empire; as her selfe should force Their functions onely, to serue her discourse; And, that; to beat the streight path of one ende Which is, to make her substance still contend, To be Gods Image; in informing it, With knowledge; holy thoughts, and all formes fit For that eternitie, ye seeke in way Of his sole imitation; and to sway, Your lifes loue so, that hee may still be Center To all your pleasures; and you, (here) may enter The next lifes peace; in gouerning so well Your sensuall parts, that you, as free may dwell Of vulgare Raptures, here; as when calme death Dissolues that learned Empire, with your Breath. To teach, and liue thus, is the onely vse, And end of Learning. Skill that doth produce But tearmes, and tongues, and Parrating of Arte, Without that powre to rule the errant part; Is that which some call, learned ignorance; A serious trifle; error in a trance. And let a Scholler, all earths volumes carrie, He will be but a walking dictionarie: A meere articulate Clocke, that doth but speake By others arts; when wheeles weare, or springs breake, Or any fault is in him; hee can mend No more then clockes; but at set howres must spend His mouth, as clocks do; If too fast, speech goe Hee cannot stay it; nor haste if too slowe. So that, as Trauaylers, seeke their peace through storms, In passing many Seas, for many forms, Of forreigne gouernment; indure the paine Of many faces seeing; and the gaine That Strangers make, of their strange-louing humors; Learn tongues; keep note books; all to feed the tumors Of vaine discourse at home; or serue the course Of State employment, neuer hauing force T'employ themselues; but idle complements Must pay their paines, costs, slaueries, all their Rents; And, though they many men knowe, get few friends: So couetous Readers; setting many endes To their much skill to talke; studiers of Phrase; Shifters in Art; to flutter in the Blaze Of ignorant count'nance; to obtaine degrees And lye in Learnings bottome, like the Lees, To be accounted deepe, by shallow men; And carue all Language, in one glorious Pen; May haue much fame for learning: but th' effect Proper to perfect Learning; to direct Reason in such an Art, as that it can Turne blood to soule, and make both, one calme man; So making peace with God; doth differ farre From Clearkes that goe with God &amp; man to warre. Int. But may this Peace, and mans true Empire then, By learning be obtainde? and taught to men? Pea. Let all men iudge; who is it can denie, That the rich crowne of ould Humanitie, Is still your birth-right? and was ne're let downe From heauen, for rule of Beasts liues, but your owne? You learne the depth of Arts; and (curious) dare By them (in Natures counterfaits) compare Almost with God; to make perpetually Motion like heauens; to hang sad Riuers by The ayre, in ayre; and earth, twixt earth and heauen By his owne paise. And are these vertues giuen To powrefull Art, and Vertue's selfe denied? This proues the other, vaine, and falsified. Wealth, Honour, and the Rule of Realmes doth fall In lesse then Reasons compasse; yet, what all Those things are giuen for (which is liuing well) Wants discipline, and reason to compell. O foolish men! how many waies ye vex Your liues with pleasing them? and still perplex Your liberties, with licence? euery way Casting your eyes, and faculties astray From their sole obiect? If some few bring forth (In Nature, freely) something of some worth; Much rude and worthlesse humour runs betwixt; (Like fruit in deserts) with vile matter mixt. Nor (since they flatter flesh so) they are bould (As a most noble spectacle) to behould Their owne liues; and (like sacred light) to beare There Reason inward: for the Soule (in feare Of euerie sort of vice, shee there containes) Flies out; and wanders about other mens; Feeding, and fatting, her infirmities. And as in auntient Citties, t'was the guise To haue some Ports of sad, and haplesse vent, Through which, all executed men they sent; All filth; all off all, cast from what purg'd sinne; Nought, chaste, or sacred, there going out, or in: So, through mens refuse eares, will nothing pearse Thats good, or elegant; but the sword; the herse; And all that doth abhorre, from mans pure vse, Is each mans onely Siren; only Muse. And thus, for one God; one fit good; they prise These idle, foolish, vile varieties. Int. Wretched estate of men, by fortune blest; That being euer idle, neuer rest; That haue goods, ere they earne them; and for that, Want art to vse them. To bee wonderd at Is Iustice; for Proportion, Ornament; None of the Graces, is so excellent. Vile things, adorne her: me thought, once I sawe How, by the Seas shore, she sat giuing lawe Euen to the streames, and fish (most loose, and wilde) And was (to my thoughts) wondrous sweet and milde; Yet fire flew from her that dissolued Rocks; Her lookes, to Pearle turnd pebble; and her locks, The rough, and sandy bankes, to burnisht gould; Her white left hand, did goulden bridles holde; And, with her right, she wealthy gifts did giue; Which with their left hands, men did still receiue; Vpon a world in her chaste lappe, did lye, A little Iuory Book, that show'd mine eye, But one Page onely; that one verse containde, Where all Arts, were contracted, and explainde; All policies of Princes, all their forces; Rules for their feares, cares, dangers, pleasures, purses, All the fayre progresse of their happinesse here, Iustice conuerted, and composed there. All which I thought on, when I had exprest Why great men, of the great states they possest, Enioyd so little; and I now must note The large straine of a verse, I long since wrote. Which (me thought) much ioy, to men poore presented; God hath made none (that all might be) contented. Peace. It might (for the capacitie it beares) Be that concealed and expressiue verse, That Iustice, in her Iuorie Manuell writ; Since all Lines to mans Peace, are drawne in it. For great men; though such ample stuffe they haue To shape contentment; yet, since (like a waue) It flittes, and takes all formes, retayning none; (Not fitted to their patterne, which is one) They may content themselues; God hath not giuen, To men meere earthly, the true Ioyes of heauen; And so their wilde ambitions either stay; Or turne their headstrong course, the better way. For poore men; their cares may be richly easde; Since rich (with all they haue) liue as displeasde. Int. You teach me to be plaine. But whats the cause, That great, and rich, whose stares winne such applause; With such enforc't, and vile varieties, Spend time; nor giue their liues glad sacrifice; But when they eate, and drinke, with tales, iests, sounds; As if (like frantique men, that feele no wounds) They would expire in laughters? and so erre From their right way; that like a Trauayler, (Weariest when neerest to his iourneys ende) Time best spent euer, with most paine they spend? Pea. The cause, is want of Learning; which (being right) Makes idlenesse a paine; and paine delight. It makes men knowe, that they (of all things borne Beneath the siluer Moone, and goulden Morne) Being onely formes of God; should onely fix One forme of life to those formes; and not mix With Beasts in formes of their liues. It doth teach, To giue the soule her Empire; and so reach To rule of all the bodies mutinous Realme; In which (once seated, She then takes the Helme, And gouernes freely; stering to one Port. Then, (like a man in health) the whole consort Of his tun'd body, sings; which otherwise, Is like one full of weiward maladies, Still out of tune; and (like to Spirits raisde Without a Circle) neuer is appaisde. And then, they haue no strength, but weakens them; No greatnes, but doth crush them into streame; No libertie, but turnes into their snare; Their learnings then, do light them but to erre; Their ornaments, are burthens; their delights, Are mercinarie, seruile Parasites, Betraying, laughing; Feends, that raisde in feares, At parting, shake their Roofes about their eares; Th' imprison'd thirst, the fortunes of the Free; The Free, of Rich; Rich, of Nobilitie; Nobilitie, of Kings; and Kings, Gods thrones; Euen to their lightning flames; and thunder-stones. O liberall Learning, that well vsde, giues vse To all things good; how bad is thy abuse! When, onely thy diuine reflection can (That lights but to thy loue) make good a man; How can the regular Body of thy light, Informe, and decke him? the Ills infinite, That (like beheaded Hydra's in that Fen Of bloud, and flesh, in lewd illiterate men) Aunswere their amputations, with supplyes That twist their heads, and euer double rise; Herculean Learning conquers; And O see How many, and of what fowle formes they be? Vnquiet, wicked thoughts; vnnumbred passions; Poorenesse of Counsailes; howrely fluctuations; (In entercourse) of woes, and false delights; Impotent wils to goodnesse; Appetites That neuer will bee bridl'd; satisfied; Nor knowe how, or with what to be supplyed; Feares, and distractions, mixt with greedinesse; Stupidities of those things ye possesse; Furies for what ye lose; wrongs done for nonce; For present, past, and future things, at once Cares vast, and endlesse; miseries, swolne with pride; Vertues despisde, and vices glorified. All these, true Learning calmes, and can subdue: But who turnes learning this way? All pursue Warre with each other, that exasperates these; For things without; whose ends are inward peace; And yet those inward Rebels they maintaine. And as your curious sort of Passiue men, Thrust their heads through the Roofs of Rich &amp; Poore; Through all their liues, and fortunes, and explore Forraigne, and home-affayres; their Princes Courts, Their Counsaile, and Bedchambers for reports; And (like free-booters) wander out, to win Matter to feede their mutinous Route within; (Which are the greedier still) and ouershoote Their true-sought inward Peace, for outward boote; So Learned men, in controuersies spend (Of tongues, and tearmes, readings, and labours pend) Their whole liues studies; Glorie, Riches, Place, In full crie, with the vulgare giuing Chace; And neuer, with their learnings true vse striue To bridle strifes within them; and to liue Like men of Peace, whome Art of Peace begat: But, as their deedes, are most adulterate, And showe them false Sons, to their Peacefull Mother, In those warres; so their Arts, are prov'd no other. And let the best of them, a search impose Vpon his Art: for all the things shee knowes (All being referd, to all, to her vnknowne) They will obtaine the same proportion That doth a little brooke that neuer ran Through Summers Sunne; compar'd with th' Ocean. But, could he Oracles speake; and wright to charme A wilde of Sauadges; take Natures Arme, And plucke into his search, the Circuit Of Earth, and Heauen; the Seas space, and the spirit Of euerie Starre: the Powers of Herbs, and Stones; Yet touch not, at his perturbations; Nor giue them Rule, and temper, to obay Imperiall Reason; in whose Soueraigne sway, Learning is wholly vs'd, and dignified; To what end serues he? is his learning tryed That comforting, and that creating Fire That fashions men? or that which doth inspire Citties with ciuile conflagrations, Countries, and kingdomes? That Art that attones All opposition to good life, is all; Liue well ye Learnd; and all men ye enthrall. Interlo. Alas they are discourag'd in their courses, And (like surpris'd Forts) beaten from their forces. Bodies, on Rights of Soules did neuer growe With ruder Rage, then barbarous Torrents flowe Ouer their sacred Pastures; bringing in Weedes, and all rapine; Temples now begin To suffer second deluge; Sinne-drownde Beasts, Making their Altars crack; and the filde Nests Of vulturous Fowles, filling their holy places; For wonted Ornaments, and Religious graces. Pea. The chiefe cause is, since they themselues betraie; Take their Foes baites, for some particular swaie T'inuert their vniuersall; and this still, Is cause of all ills else; their liuing ill. Int. Alas! that men should striue for others swaie; But first to rule themselues: And that being waie To all mens Bliss; why is it trod by none? And why are rules so dully lookt vpon That teach that liuely Rule? Pea. O horrid thing! Tis Custome powres into your common spring Such poyson of Example, in things vaine; That Reason nor Religion can constraine Mens sights of serious things; and th' onely cause That neither humane nor celestiall lawes Drawe man more compasse; is his owne slacke bent T'intend no more his proper Regiment. Where; if your Actiue men (or men of action) Their Policie, Auarice, Ambition, Faction, Would turne to making strong, their rule of Passion, To search, and settle them, in Approbation Of what they are, and shalbe (which may be By Reason, in despight of Policie) And in one true course, couch their whole Affaires To one true blisse, worth all the spawne of theirs; If halfe the idle speech, men Passiue spend, At sensuall meetings, when they recommend Their sanguine Soules, in laughters, to their Peace, Were spent in Counsailes how they might decrease That frantique humour of ridiculous blood (Which addes, they vainely thinke, to their liues flood) And so conuerted, in true humane mirth, To speech, what they shall be (dissolv'd from Earth) In bridling it in flesh; with all the scope Of their owne knowledge here; and future hope: If (last of all) your Intellectiue men Would mixe the streames of euery iarring Penne. In one calme Current; that like land flouds, now Make all Zeales bounded Riuers ouer-flowe; Firme Truth, with question, euery howre pursue; And yet will have no question, all is true: Search in that troubled Ocean, for a Ford That by it selfe runnes; and must beare accord In each mans self; by banishing falshood there, Wrath, lust, pride, earthy thoughts; before elsewhere. (For, as in one man, is the world inclosde, So to forme one, it should be all disposde:) If all these would concurre to this one end, It would aske all their powres; and all would spend Life with that reall sweetnesse, which they dreame Comes in with obiects that are meere extreame: And make them outward pleasures still apply Which neuer can come in, but by that key; Others aduancements, others Fames desiring; Thirsting, exploring, praysing, and admiring; Like lewd adultererers, that their owne wiues scorne, And other mens, with all their wealth, adorne. Why, in all outraying, varyed ioyes, and courses, That in these errant times, tire all mens forces, Is this so common wonder of our dayes? That in poore foretimes, such a fewe could raise So many wealthy Temples, and these none? All were deuout then; all deuotions one; And to one end conuerted; and when men Giue vp themselues to God; all theirs goes then: A few well-giuen, are worth a world of ill; And worlds of Powre, not worth one poore good-will. And what's the cause, that (being but one Truth) spreds About the world so manie thousand heads, Of false Opinions, all self-lov'd as true? Onely affection, to things more then due: One Error kist, begetteth infinite. How can men finde truth, in waies opposite? And with what force, they must take opposite wayes When all haue opposite obiects? Truth displaies One colourd ensigne; and the world pursues Ten thousand colours: see (to iudge, who vse Truth in their Arts;) what light their liues doe giue: For wherefore doe they study, but to liue? See I Eternities streight milke-white waie, And One, in this lifes crooked vanities straie; And, shall I thinke he knowes Truth, following Error? This; onely this; is the infallible myrror, To showe, why Ignorants, with learn'd men vaunt, And why your learn'd men, are so ignorant. Why euery Youth, in one howre will be old In euery knowledge; and why Age doth mould. Then; As in Rules of true Philosophie There must be euer due Analogie Betwixt the Powre that knowes, and that is knowne, So surely ioynde that they are euer one; The vnderstanding part transcending still To that it vnderstands, that, to his skill; All, offering to the Soule, the Soule to God; (By which do all things make their Period In his high Powre; and make him, All in All; So, to ascend, the high-heauen-reaching Skale Of mans true Peace; and make his Art entire, By calming all his Errors in desire; (Which must preceede, that higher happinesse) Proportion still, must trauerse her accesse Betwixt his powre, and will; his Sense and Soule; And euermore th' exorbitance controule Of all forms, passing through the bodies Powre, Till in the soule they rest, as in their Towre. Int. But; as Earths grosse and elementall fire, Cannot maintaine it selfe; but doth require Fresh matter still, to giue it heate, and light; And, when it is enflam'd; mounts not vpright; But struggles in his lame impure ascent; Now this waie works, and then is that waie bent, Not able, straight, t'aspire to his true Sphere Where burns the fire, eternall, and sincere; So, best soules here; with heartiest zeales enflam'd In their high flight for heauen; earth-broos'd and lam'd) Make many faint approches; and are faine, VVith much vnworthy matter, to sustaine Their holiest fire; and with sick feathers, driuen, And broken Pinions, flutter towards heauen. Peace The cause is, that you neuer will bestowe Your best, t'enclose your liues, twixt God, and you; To count the worlds Loue, Fame, Ioy, Honour, nothing; But life, (with all your loue to it) betrothing To his loue; his recomfort; his rewarde; Since no good thought calls to him, but is heard. Nor neede you, thinke this strange; since he is there, Present: within you; euer, euery where Where good thoughts are; for Good hath no estate Without him; nor himself is, without That: If then, this Commerce stand twixt you entire; Trie, if he either, grant not each desire; Or so conforme it, to his will, in staie; That you shall finde him, there, in the delaie, As well as th' instant grant; And so prooue, right How easie, his deare yoke is; and how light His equall burthen: whether this Commerce Twixt God and man, be so hard, or peruerse (In composition); as, the Raritie, Or no-where-patterne of it, doth implie? Or if, in worthy contemplation It do not tempt, beyond comparison Of all things worldly? Sensualitie, Nothing so easie; all Earths Companie, (Like Rubarb, or the drugges of Thessalie) Compar'd, in taste with that sweet? O trie then If, that contraction (by the God of men) Of all the lawe, and Prophets, layd vpon The tempting Lawyer; were a lode, that None Had powre to stand beneath? If Gods deare loue, Thy Conscience do not, at first sight approue Deare, aboue all things? And, so passe this shelfe; To loue (withall) thy Neighbour as thy selfe? Not, loue as much; but as thy selfe; in this, To let it be as free, as thine owne is; Without respect of profit, or reward, Deceipt, or flatterie; politique regard, Or anie thing, but naked Charitie. Interlo. I call, euen God, himselfe; to testifie (For men, I know but fewe) that farre aboue All to be here desir'd; I rate his loue. Thanks to his still-kist-hand, that so hath fram'd My poore, and abiect life; and so, inflam'd My soule with his sweete, all-want-seasoning loue; In studying to supply, though not remoue, My desert fortunes, and vnworthinesse, With some wisht grace from him; that might expresse His presence with me; and so dignifie, My life, to creepe on earth; behold the skie, And giue it meanes enough, for this lowe plight; Though, hitherto, with no one houres delight, Heartie or worthie; but in him alone; Who, like a carefull guide, hath hal'd me on; And (euery minute, sinking) made we swimme, To this calme Shore; hid, with his Sonne, in him: And here, ay me! (as trembling, I looke back) I fall againe, and, in my hauen, wracke; Still being perswaded (by the shamelesse light) That these are dreames, of my retired Night; That, all my Reading; Writing; all my paines Are serious trifles; and the idle vaines Of an vnthriftie Angell, that deludes My simple fancie; and, by Fate, extendes My Birth-accurst life, from the blisse of men: And then; my hands I wring; my bosome, then Beate, and could breake ope; fill th' inraged Ayre; And knock at heauen, with sighs; inuoke Despaire, At once, to free the tyr'd Earth of my lode; That these recoiles, (that, Reason doth explode; Religion damns; and my arm'd Soule defies; Wrastles with Angels; telling Heauen it lies, If it denie the truth, his Spirit hath writ, Grauen, in my soule, and there eternisde it) Should beat me from that rest; and that is this; That these prodigious Securities That all men snore-in (drowning in vile liues The Soules of men, because the bodie thriues) Are Witch-crafts damnable; That all learnings are Foolish, and false, that with those vile liues square; That these sowre wizzards, that so grauely scorne Learning with good life; kinde gainst kinde suborne; And are no more wise, then their shades, are men; Which (as my finger, can goe to my Penne) I can demonstrate; that our knowledges, Knowledge of our selues. (Which we must learne, if euer we professe Knowledge of God; or haue one Notion true) Are those, which first, and most we should pursue; That, in their searches, all mens actiue liues, Are so farre short of their contemplatiues; As Bodies are of Soules; This life, of Next: And, so much doth the Forme, and whole Context Of matter, seruing one; exceede the other; That Heauen, our Father is; as Earth our Mother. And therefore; in resemblance to approue, Who are the true bredde; fatherd by his loue; (As Heauen it selfe, doth only, virtually Mix with the Earth; his Course still keeping hie, And Substance, vndisparag'd; (though his Beames Are dround in many dung-hils; and their Steames, (To vs) obscure him; yet he euer shines:) So though our soules beames, digge in bodies Mines, To finde them rich discourses, through their Senses; And meet with many myddins of offences, Whose Vapours choke their Organes; yet should they Disperse them by degrees; because their swaie (In Powre) is absolute; And (in that Powre) shine As firme as heauen; heauen, nothing so diuine. All this, I holde; and since, that all truth else, That all else knowe, or can holde; staies and dwelles On these grounds vses; and should all contend (Knowing our birth here, serues but for this end To make true meanes, and waies, t'our second life) To plie those studies; and holde euery strife To other ends (more then to amplifie, Adorne, and sweeten these) deseruedly) As balls cast in our Race; and but grasse knitt From both sides of our Path; t'ensnare our wit: And thus, because, the gaudie vulgar light Burns vp my good thoughts, form'd in temperate Night, Rising to see, the good Moone oftentimes (Like the poore virtues of these vicious times) Labour as much to lose her light; as when She fills her waning horns; And how (like men Raisd to high Places) Exhalations fall That would be thought Starres; Ile retire from all The hot glades of Ambition; Companie, That (with their vainenesse) make this vanitie; And coole to death, in shaddowes of this vale: To which end, I will cast this Serpents skale; This loade of life, in life; this fleshie stone; This bond, and bundle of corruption; This breathing Sepulcher; this spundge of griefe; This smiling Enemie; this household-thiefe; This glasse of ayre; broken with lesse then breath; This Slaue, bound face to face, to death, till death; And consecrate my life, to you, and yours: In which obiection; if that Powre of Powers That hath reliev'd me thus farre; with a hand Direct, and most immediate; still will stand Betwixt me, and the Rapines of the Earth; And giue my poore paines, but such gratious birth, As may sustaine me, in my desert Age, With some powre, to my will; I still will wage Warre with that false Peace, that exileth you; And (in my prayd for freedome) euer vow, Teares in these shades, for your teares; till mine eyes Poure out my soule in better sacrifise. Peace. Nor doubt (good friend) but God, to whom I see Your friendlesse life conuerted; still will be A rich supply for friends; And still be you Sure Conuertite to him. This, this way rowe All to their Countrie. Thinke how hee hath shew'd You wayes, and by wayes; what to bee pursew'd, And what auoyded. Still, in his hands be, If you desire to liue, or safe, or free. No longer dayes take; Nature doth exact This resolution of thee, and this fact: The Foe hayles on thy head; and in thy Face Insults, and trenches; leaues thee, no worlds grace; The walles, in which thou art besieged, shake. Haue done; Resist no more: but if you take Firme notice of our speech, and, what you see; And will adde paines to write all; let it be Divulged too. Perhappes, of all, some one May finde some good: But might it touch vpon Your gratious Princes liking; hee might doe Good to himselfe, and all his kingdomes too: So virtuous, a great Example is; And that, hath thankt, as small a thing as this; Here being stuffe, and forme, for all true Peace; And so, of all mens perfect Happinesse. To which, if hee shall lend his Princely eare, And giue commandement (from your selfe) to heare My state; tell him you know me; and that I, That am the Crowne of Principalitie, (Though thus cast off by Princes) euer vow Attendance at his foote; till I may growe Vp to his bosome; which (being deaw'd in time With these my Teares) may to my comforts clyme: Which (when all Pleasures, into Palseys turne, And Sunne-like Pomp; in his own clowds shal mourne) Will be acceptiue. Meane space I will pray, That hee may turne, some toward thought this way; While the round whirlewindes, of the earths delights Dust betwixt him and me; and blinde the sights Of all men rauisht with them; whose encrease (You well may tell him) fashions not true Peace. The Peace that they informe; learns but to squat, While the slye legall foe (that leuels at Warre, through those false lights) soudainly runs by Betwixt you, and your strength; and while you lye, Couching your eares; and flatting euerie lymme So close to earth, that you would seeme to him The Earth it selfe: yet hee knowes who you are; And, in that vantage, poures on, ready warre. Conclusio. Thus, by the way, to humane Loues interring, These marginall, and secret teares referring To my disposure (hauing all this howre Of our vnwordly conference, giuen powre To her late-fainting issue, to arise) She raisde her selfe, and them; The Progenies Of that so ciuile Desert, rising all; Who fell with her; and to the Funerall (She bearing still the Coffine) all went on. And, now giues Time, her states description. Before her flew Affliction, girt in storms, Gasht all with gushing wounds; and all the formes Of bane, and miserie, frowning in her face; Whom Tyrannie, and Iniustice, had in Chace; Grimme Persecution, Pouertie, and Shame; Detraction, Enuie, foule Mishap and lame; Scruple of Conscience; Feare, Deceipt, Despaire; Slaunder, and Clamor, that rent all the Ayre; Hate, Warre, and Massacre; vncrowned Toyle; And Sickenes (t'all the rest, the Base, and Foile) Crept after; and his deadly weight, trode downe Wealth, Beautie, and the glorie of a Crowne. These vsherd her farre of; as figures giuen, To showe, these Crosses borne, make peace with heauen, But now (made free from them) next her, before; Peacefull, and young, Herculean silence bore His craggie Club; which vp, aloft, hee hild; With which, and his forefingers charme hee stild All sounds in ayre; and left so free, mine eares, That I might heare, the musique of the Spheres, And all the Angels, singing, out of heauen; Whose tunes were solemne (as to Passion giuen) For now, that Iustice was the Happinesse there For all the wrongs to Right, inflicted here. Such was the Passion that Peace now put on; And on, all went; when soudainely was gone All light of heauen before vs; from a wood Whose sight, fore-seene (now lost) amaz'd wee stood, The Sunne still gracing vs; when now (the Ayre Inflam'd with Meteors) we discouerd, fayre, The skipping Gote; the Horses flaming Mane; Bearded, and trained Comets; Starres in wane; The burning sword; the Firebrand, flying Snake; The Lance; the Torch; the Licking fire; the Drake: And all else Metors, that did ill abode; The thunder chid; the lightning leapt abrode; And yet, when Peace came in, all heauen was cleare; And then, did all the horrid wood appeare; Where mortall dangers, more then leaues did growe; In which wee could not, one free steppe bestowe; For treading on some murtherd Passenger, Who thither, was by witchcraft, forc't to erre. Whose face, the bird hid, that loues Humans best; That hath the bugle eyes, and Rosie Breast; And is the yellow Autumns Nightingall; Peace made vs enter here secure of all; Where, in a Caue, that through a Rocke did eate The monster, Murther, held his impious Seat: A heape of panting Harts, supported him; On which, he sate, gnawing a reeking lymme, Of some man newly murtherd. As he eate His graue-digg'd Browes, like stormy Eaues did sweat; Which, like incensed Fennes, with mists did smoke; His hyde was rugged, as an aged Oke With heathie Leprosies; that still hee fed With hote raw lyms, of men late murthered. His Face was like a Meteor, flashing blood; His head all bristl'd, like a thornie wood; His necke cast wrinkles, like a Sea enrag'd; And, in his vast Armes, was the world engag'd, Bathing his hands in euerie cruell deed; Whose Palmes were hell-deepe lakes of boyling lead; His thighes were mines of poyson, torment, griefe; In which digg'd Fraude, and Trecherie, for reliefe; Religions Botcher, Policie; and Pride; Oppression, Slauerie, Flatterie glorified; Atheisme, and Tyranny, and gaine vniust; Franticke Ambition, Enuie, shagge-heard Lust; Both sorts of Ignorance; and Knowledge swell'd; And ouer these, the ould wolfe Auarice held A goulden Scourge, that dropt, with blood and vapor; With which, he whipt them to their endlesse labor. From vnder heapes, cast from his fruitfull thyes, (As ground, to all their damn'd Impieties) The mourneful Goddesse, drew dead Humane Loue; Nor could they let her entrie, though they stroue; And furnac't on her, all their venemous breath; (For; though all outrage breakes the Peace of death) She Coffind him; and forth to Funerall All helpt to beare him: But to sound it all, My Trumpet fayles; and all my forces shrinke. Who can enact to life, what kils to thinke? Nor can the Soules beames beat, through blood &amp; flesh, Formes of such woe, and height, as now, afresh, Flow'd from these Obiects: to see Poesie Prepar'd to doe the speciall obsequie, And sing the Funerall Oration; How it did showe, to see her tread vpon The breast of Death; and on a Furie leane; How, to her Fist, (as rites of seruice then) A Cast of Rauens flew; On her shoulders, how The Foules, that to the Muses Queene we vow, (The Owle, and Heronshawe) sate, how, for her hayre, A haplesse Comet, hurld about the Ayre Her curled Beames: whence sparkes, like falling starres, Vanisht about her; and with windes aduerse, Were still blowne back; To which the Phœnix flew; And (burning on her head) would not renew: How her diuine Oration did moue, For th' vnredeemed losse of humane Loue; Obiect mans future state to reasons eye; The soules infusion; Immortalitie; And proue her formes firme, that are here imprest; How her admirde straines, wrought on euery Beast; And made the woods cast their Immanitie, Vp to the Ayre; that did to Citties flye In Fewell for them: and, in Clowds of smoke, Euer hang ouer them; cannot be spoke; Nor how to Humane loue (to Earth now giuen) A lightening stoop't, and rauisht him to heauen, And with him Peace, with all her heauenly seede: Whose outward Rapture, made me inward bleed; Nor can I therefore, my Intention keepe; Since Teares want words, &amp; words want teares to weepe. Corollarium ad Principem. Thus shooke I this abortiue from my Braine; Which, with it, laie in this vnworthy paine: Yet since your Homer had his worthy hand In vent'ring this delaie of your Command, To end his Iliades; deigne (Great Prince of men) To holde before it your great Shielde; and then It may, doe seruice, worthy this delaie, To your more worthy Pleasure; and I maie Regather the sperst fragments of my spirits, And march with Homer through his deathless merits, To your vndying graces. Nor did he Vanish with this slight vision; but brought me Home to my Cabine; and did all the waie Assure me of your Graces constant staie To his soules Being, wholly naturalliz'd And made your Highnesse subiect; which he priz'd, Past all his honours helde in other Lands; And that (because a Princes maine state stands In his owne knowledge, and his powre within) These works that had chiefe virtue to beginne Those informations; you would holde most deare; Since false Ioyes, haue their seasons to appeare Iust as they are; but these delights were euer Perfect and needefull, and would irke you neuer. I praying for this happie worke of heauen In your sweete disposition; the calme Euen Tooke me to rest; and he with wings of Fire, To soft Ayres supreame Region did aspire. By the euer most humbly and truly dedicated to your most Princely graces, Geo. Chapman.</field>
