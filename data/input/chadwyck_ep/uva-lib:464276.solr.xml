TO THE RIGHT HONO?????, ARTHVRE Lord CHICHESTER, Baron of Belfast, Lord high Treasurer of Jreland, and one of his Majesties most Honorable Priuy Counsell, of that Kingdome. Songs of 3. Voyces [I. Love is the fire that burnes me] Loue is the fire that burnes me Loue is the fire that burnes me, The smokes are thoughts confused, Which dimmes my soule, my soule, And hath my sence abused, Though fire to ashes turne me, Yet doth the smoke more grieue mee, That dimmes my minde, Whose light should still relieue me. Though fire to ashes turne me, Yet doth the smoke more grieue me, That dims my minde, whose light should still relieue me. [II. My Mistrisse after seruice due] My Mistrisse after seruice due My Mistrisse after seruice due, Demaunded if indeed my loue were true, I said it was, Then shee replide, That I must hate who she defide, And so my selfe, aboue the rest, Whom she, (she swore) did most of all detest, In sooth said I, you see I hate my selfe, Who sets my loue on such a peeuish elfe. In sooth said I, you see I hate my selfe, who sets my loue on such a peeuish elfe. [III. One woman scarce of twenty] One woman scarce of twenty One woman scarce of twenty. But hath of teares great plenty, Which they powre out like fountaines, That runne downe from the mountaines, Yet all is but beguiling, Their teares and eke their smiling, Ile therefore neuer trust them, Since nature hath so curst them, That they can weepe in smiling, Poore fooles thereby beguiling Ile therefore neuer trust them, Since nature hath so curst them, That they can weepe in smiling, Poore fooles thereby beguiling. [IIII. If I seeke to inioy] If I seeke to inioy, the fruits of my paine If I seeke to inioy, the fruits of my paine, She careles denyes me, with endles disdaine, Yet so much I loue her, that nothing can either remoue me, or moue her, Alas, why contend I, why striue I in vaine? in vaine, The water to mingle With Oyle that is Ayre, and loues to be single, Tis not loue but Fate whose doome I abide, You pow'rs and you plannets, which Destenies guide, Change your Opposition, It fits heau'nly powers to be milde of Condition. Change your Opposition, It fits heau'nly powers to be milde of Condition. [V. Pleasure] Pleasure, is a wanton thing Pleasure, is a wanton thing, When old and young doe dance and spring, Pleasure, is a wanton thing, When old and young, doe dance and spring, Pleasure it is that most desire, And yet tis but a fooles hire. Pleasure it is that most desire, And yet tis but a fooles hire. [VI. Sweet those Trammels of your haire] Sweet, those Trammels of your haire Sweet, those Trammels of your haire, Golden locks more truely are, My thoughts locking to your beautie, Thus you doe, my captiue minde, From my dying body binde, Onely to you, to doe duty. O my deere let it goe free, Or my body take to thee, So your Captiues you shall cherish, For if parted thus they lye, Or my thoughts or I must dye, T'will grieue thee, if either perish, Songs of 4. Voyces [VII. Liue not poore bloome] Liue not poore bloome, but perish Liue not poore bloome, but perish, Whose Spring frosty Winter blasteth, Other buds fresh Mayes doe cherish, Hyems o're thee his snow casteth, And in wither'd armes thee graspeth, Tyrants, nothing worse you can, Now my liuely body's yoaked, to the dead corps of a man, Thus with loathed burden choked, Lingering death with teares inuoked. [VIII. The Nightingale in silent night] The Nightingale in silent night The Nightingale in silent night, Doth sing as well as in the light, To lull loues watchfull eyes asleepe, She doth such nightly sonnets keepe, Hey hoe, Sing we with all, What fortune vs so ere befall. Hey hoe, Sing we with all, What fortune vs so ere befall. [IX. Oh, what is she] Oh, what is she, what is she Oh, what is she, what is she, Whose lookes like lightnings pierce thus suddenly my brest, Scorching no skinne? Yet oh yet oh, yet oh, yet oh, my heart burnes with a fire fierce, The flames ascending, in my face are seene, Yet courage man, Her speaking eye doth shew, Some fire remaines, from whence those lightnings flew. [X. See forth her eyes] See forth her eyes her startled spirit peepes See forth her eyes her startled spirit peepes, Which now she on me, straight she off me keepes, Not able long, lookes off, lookes on, doth blush, doth tremble, Sweet wretch she would, but cannot loue dissemble, but cannot loue dissemble, not loue dissemble, Happy euent, Whats lingering is but sleight, Who euer lou'd that lou'd not at first sight? [XI. When to the gloomie woods] When to the gloomie woods When to the gloomie woods, When to the barren plaine, When to the stony rocks and sullen floods, I wayling often goe, and of my Loue complaine, How senceles then thinke I, By loue I grow, To senceles things that tell my woe? Yet these my piercing moanes, haue touched oft so nye, That they to me replie, But cruell, cruell she, More senceles then hard stones, Quite senceles of my paine, No answer giues, Vnmoued still remaines. [XII. I floods of teares could clense my follies past] I floods of teares could clense my follies past I floods of teares could clense my follies past, Or smokes of sighes might sacrifice for sinne, If groning cries might salue my faults at last, Or endlesse moane for errour pardon winne: Then would I cry, weepe, sigh, and euer moane, Mine errours, faults, sinnes, follies, past and gone, follies past and gone. Then would I cry, weepe, sigh, and euer moane, Mine errours, faults, sinnes, follies, past and gone, follies past and gone. Songs of 5. Voyces [XIII. Haue I found her] Haue I found her? Haue I found her? (O rich finding) haue I found her? (O rich finding,) Goddesse like for to behold, Her faire tresses seemely binding, In a Chaine of pearle and gould, and gould, Chaine me Chaine me, O most faire, Chaine me to thee with that haire, O most faire, Chaine me to thee with that haire. [XIIII. Downe the hills Corina trips] Downe the hills Corina trips Downe the hills Corina trips, Corina trips, Fetching many wanton skips, To the groue she doth goe, Where thousand birds in a rowe, Sitting all vpon a tree, And three by three, Corina coueting to see, to see, Tuning notes of her praise, Doe welcome her with Roundelayes. with rounde roundelayes. with roundelayes. Tuning notes, tuning notes of her praise, Doe welcome her with roundelayes, with roundelayes. with rounde rounde roundelayes. [XV. Camella faire tript or'e the plaine] Camella faire tript or'e the plaine Camella faire tript or'e the plaine, I follow'd quickly after, Haue ouertaken her I would faine, and kisse her when I caught her, But hope be'ng past her to obtaine, Camella loud I call, She answerd me with great disdaine, I will not kisse at all, I will not kisse at all, at all, I will not kisse, not kisse, not kisse at all. But hope be'ng past her to obtaine, Camella loud I call, She answerd me with great disdaine I will not kisse at all. [XVI. Sadnesse sit downe] Sadnesse sit downe, on my soule feed Sadnesse sit downe, on my soule feed, Teare vp thoughts, tombe, a numbed heart, make wounds to speake, and scarres to bleede, On withered strings tune springing smart, on withered strings tune springing smart, And leaue this farwell for posteritie, Life is a death where sorrow cannot dye. And leaue this farwell, this farwell for posteritie, Life is a death where sorrow cannot dye. [XVII. Life of my life] Life of my life, How should I liue alas Life of my life, How should I liue alas, since thou art thus resolu'd for to depart? Or how should I disguise, my secret smart, Wanting the sweet fru'tion of thy face? Where beauty, loue, with maiestie and grace, (Things seld or neuer, meeting in one place) Haue all conspir'd to plague a plagued hart, alwaies careles of my carefull case, Then if thou wilt not haue thy loue to mourne, to mourne, Deere to my soule, O deere to my soule, I pray thee make no stay, Goe not at all, or else with speede returne, Nay rather far my deere goe not away, But thou must goe, Then sweet while I thee see, Farwell, farwell, But bide, or let me dye. [XVIII. I heard a noise] I heard a noise, and wished for a sight I heard a noise, and wished for a sight, I lookt aside, and did a shadow see, a shadow see, Whose substance was the summe of my delight, It came vnseene, and so it went from me, But yet Conceit perswaded my entent, There was a substance where the shadow went, I did not play Narcissus in conceit, I did not see my shadow in a spring, a spring, I knew my eyes were dim'd with no deceit, I saw the shadow of some worthy thing, For as I saw the shadow passing by, I had a glance, I had a glance of somthing in my eye, Shadow or she, or both, or chuse you whether, Blest be the thing that brought the shadow hether. Blest be the thing that brought the shadow hether. [XIX. With bitter sighs I heard Amintas playning] With bitter sighs I heard Amintas playning With bitter sighs I heard Amintas playning, For his chast loue, he found but deepe disdaining, As thus he sat, and in his griefe did tremble, To cheere his spirits the Ãr'all queere assemble, assemble, They sweetly sing, In dolefull tunes he cryes, Griefes are long li'ud, and sorrow seldome dyes. [XX. Why doe I dying liue] Why doe I dying liue, and see my life bereft me? Why doe I dying liue, and see my life bereft me? Why doe I doubt to dye, and see death onely left me? Th'enlargement of my better selfe by natures foe, Confines my haplesse life, to neuer dying woe, Immur'd in sorrowes hold I onely see the light, see the light of all my ioyes, Wrapt vp in horrors blackest night, in horrors blackest night, Then like Meander Swans, before my death, in fatall notes, Ile sigh my latest breath. Ile sigh, my latest breath. Ile sigh my latest breath. [XXI. In depth of griefe] In depth of griefe, and sorrow great In depth of griefe, and sorrow great, Oft haue I, my selfe bewailed, my selfe bewailed, of that same loue that late had seate in my heart, but now is failed, And sorrow thou hast done the worst that thou canst doe, to make me Curst, And sorrow thou hast done the worst that thou canst doe, to make me Curst. [XXII. All the day I wast in weeping] All the day I wast in weeping All the day I wast in weeping, grieued with, grieued with, grieued with my loues, (Oh) grieued with my loues disdaining, All the night, all the night, I lye complaining, sighes and sobs, me watchfull keeping, For thy losse, my liues bright Iewell, Once too kinde, But now too cruell, For thy losse my liues bright Iewell, Once too kinde, but now too cruell. [XXIII. Why doest thou flye] Why doest thou flye? in such disdaine Why doest thou flye? in such disdaine, Stay, or I dye with endlesse paine, Pittie, pittie, pittie, my plaint; alas I faint, vnhappy me, wilt neuer be? Then yet at last glance backe thy eye, And see thy wretched louer dye. Then yet at last glance backe thy eye, And see thy wretched louer dye. [XXIIII. Come sorrow, helpe me to lament] Come sorrow, helpe me to lament Come sorrow, helpe me to lament, For plaining now must ease my heart, No pleasure can giue me content, For all delights doth breede my smart, doth breed my smart, Onely my loue can yeeld reliefe, Whose absence causeth all my griefe. causeth all my griefe. Onely my loue can yeeld reliefe. Whose absence causeth all my griefe. Songs of 6. Voices [XXV. Cupid in a bed of Roses] Cupid in a bed of Roses, sleeping, Sleeping Cupid in a bed of Roses, sleeping, Sleeping, chanced to be stung, of a Bee that lay among the flowers, the flowers, Where he himselfe reposes, And thus to his mother weeping told, weeping told, That he this wound did take, Of a little winged snake. As he lay securely sleeping. as he lay securely sleeping. And thus to his mother weeping told, That he this wound did take, of a little winged snake, As he lay securely sleeping. [XXVI. Cytherea smiling, said] Cytherea smiling said, smiling said, smiling, said Cytherea smiling said, smiling said, smiling, said, That if so great sorrow spring, From a silly Bees weake sting, A silly Bees weake sting, as should make thee thus dismaide, What anguish feele they think'st thou, and what paine, Whom thy empoys'ned arrowes cause complaine? [XXVII. Her haire, the net of goulden wire] Her haire, the net of goulden wire Her haire, the net of goulden wire, Wherin my heart, Led by my wandring eye, So fast entangled is, entangled is, That in no wise it can or will againe retire, againe, againe, retire. But rather will in that sweet bondage die, Then breake one haire to gaine her liberty. But rather will in that sweet bondage dye, Then breake one haire, to gaine her liberty. [XXVIII. Fond loue is blind] Fond loue is blind, Blinde therefore louers be Fond loue is blind, Blinde therefore louers be, blinde therefore louers be, But I more blinde, I more blinde, Who neare my loue did see, Pigmal'on lou'd an Image, I a name, I a name, I laught at him, But now deserue like blame, Thus foolishly I leap before I looke, I looke Seeing no baite I swallow'd haue the hooke. the hooke. Thus foolishly I leape before I looke, I looke, Seeing no baite, I swallow'd haue the hooke. the hooke. I swallow'd haue the hooke. [XXIX. Ah Cupid, grant that I may neuer see] Ah Cupid, grant that I may neuer see Ah Cupid, grant that I may neuer see, may neuer see Her through mine eare, that thus hath wounded me, If through mine eyes another wound she giue, Cupid alas, Cupid alas, then I no longer liue, no longer liue, But dye poore wretch, Shot through and through the liuer, With those sharpe arrowes, She stole from thy quiuer. But dye poore wretch, Shot through and through the liuer, With those sharpe arrowes, She stole from thy quiuer. [XXX. She with a cruell frowne] She with a cruell frowne She with a cruell frowne, opprest my trembling heart with deadly swone. Yet pitt'ing my paine, Restor'd with a kisse, with a kisse, my life againe, Restor'd with a kisse, with a kisse, with a kisse, Restor'd with a kisse my life, againe, Thus let me daily be of life depriued, of life depriued, So I be daily thus againe reuiued. So Thus let me daily be of life depriued, So I be daily thus againe reuiued. FINIS.</field>
