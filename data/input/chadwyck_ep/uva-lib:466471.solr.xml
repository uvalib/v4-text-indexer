      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND TITAN WAR AGAINST HEAVEN; OR THE TALENTS BURIED UNDER PORTLAND-ISLE. A Satirical Poem. “DECREES ARE BOUGHT, AND LAWS ARE SOLD, HONOURS AND OFFICES, FOR GOLD; THE PEOPLE'S VOICES, AND THE FREE TONGUES IN THE SENATE, BRIBED BE.” Johnson's Catiline. TO THE PUBLIC, This Poem IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR. The Ancients feign'd, from their inventive store, That on the Gods themselves, in times of yore, The Titan Giants wag'd a dreadful war, And fill'd high Heaven with dire dismay and jar;— Defied its Monarch;—to the throne aspir'd, By ruthless, wasteful, wild ambition fir'd. To carry on their scheme,—none could be madder,— Mountains on mountains pil'd, like steps of ladder, Serv'd them to scale the vast ascent, and come To fisticuffs in the celestial dome. The huge Typhoëus led the furious van, Grasping whole islands in his either span, Which, hurl'd amongst the Gods, caus'd Jove to stand Amaz'd;—the thunder useless in his hand. Briareus next, and huge Prochytè threw Like pond'rous masses, which at random flew Amidst the stars, and made th' expanse so hot, The Gods for safety left it on full trot, And fled to Egypt, where, in diff'rent form, Each sought his safety from the pelting storm. Great Jove himself a horned ram became— Than him no bell-wether was e'er more tame:— The God of song, Apollo, like a crow, Flew croaking to avoid some knock-down blow:— Gay Bacchus caper'd,—an unsav'ry goat, And browz'd among the vines to wet his throat:— In search of rats and mice, Diana stalk'd,— A cat; and Juno, like a white cow, walk'd:— Not trusting to her charms, fair Venus fled, In form of fish, to Nilus' oozy bed;— There wanton'd in the no-less wanton tide;— The term, “loose fish,” to Cyprians hence apply'd:— Light-finger'd Mercury, an Ibis flew;— So Ovid tells us,—to be sure, he knew. A rout so total ne'er before was known;— Mortals were revelling in Heaven's high throne! But Fate, which rules the Gods as well as men, Thought fit to bring things to their place again, And by slight means its latent purpose wrought When least expected:—By a lucky thought, Jesting Silenus open'd wide his throat;— So, naturally bray'd an ass's note, None of the long-ear'd tribe but would have sworn, The hero-god of some she-ass was born. Fear seiz'd the rebels;—fear, that comes and goes At the Moon's pleasure, as tide ebbs and flows:— Thus accident oft serves the purpose, when Success deny'd to all the wits of men. The Gods, now more than half their bus'ness done, Became themselves, and shar'd the vict'ry won; And as Jack Falstaff hacks the man that's slain, And beards the foe who ne'er can rise again; Just so the Gods!—The mighty Thund'rer shakes His red right-hand, and all th' empyreum quakes,— Quakes at the pow'r, which just expiring lay, Like farthing rush-light at th' approach of day. The forked lightning, at the rebels hurl'd, In spiral lines from Heaven sent them twirl'd; And Jove, than modern pugilists more wise, Who suffer prostrate enemies to rise, And tempt again the doubtful fray, took care, His sturdy foes once down, to keep them there; For cowards are in victory most cruel,— 'Tis natural,—fear is to fear a fuel! Some years have past since first the needy pack, With scarce a change of linen to each back, Resolv'd to force themselves into some note, And make their dinners at expence of throat;— That is, by dint of mouthing to run down The confidential servants of the crown, And fill their places;—ease the monarch's hand Of toilsome charge of governing the land. They knew the hard conditions of a throne, Where kings are snar'd in errors not their own; Are led hood-wink'd to do what they would shun, If suffer'd once to see the light o' th' sun: All this they knew, and for the royal ease And public good, and not themselves to please, They'd kindly interpose their firmer hands, And prop the country firm as Atlas stands. Such gen'rous motives who but should admire! Alas! the world is full of ranc'rous ire! The fool, with gold, but no one sense in store, Will aim at being witty on the poor; Make of the torn great-coat, and ragged vest, And patch'd apparel of the wretch, his jest: The coat that's soil'd on both sides with oft turning, Affords him room to say:—“The man's in mourning;” Or if on well-worn shoe a patch he spies— “Behold a plaister on his foot!”—he cries. Thus want's the butt of ev'ry wealthy fool, And ragged talents are a ridicule. In days of Juvenal the case was so, And so 'tis now;—the Giants felt the blow, Which, hurl'd at random 'mongst the headstrong crew, Hit here and there, and scarcely could miss two: From the Typhæan F?, the daring head, Down to the meanest drudge;—all wanted bread; Therefore, to use the phrase of money'd folks, ‘Those could not be good eggs that wanted yolks.’ 'Twas said they only mouth'd, because their jaws Lack'd other work, than popular applause; Something more solid,—in the sir-loin way, The road to which through the Exchequer lay. Well, be it so;—since nature teeth had giv'n, That they should eat was the design of heav'n. By industry too indolent to thrive, At cost of prudent bees the drones will hive; Gaming they'd tried, but found it would not do— The Treas'ry promis'd more than E. or O.'Twixt Africa and Europe, in the sea, The vanquish'd rebels on their huge backs lay; And on their breasts the fearful Jove bestow'd The vast Trinacrian Isle;—a pretty load! Thus shewing, by his care, how great his dread, The foes once more 'gainst Heaven might make head; But they were just as snug as if they'd been 'Squire Duncan Campbell's floating-school within. 'Tis true they ever and anon turn round To change their posture, or to shift their ground; Threat'ning, if loosen'd from their dire abodes, Again to challenge Jove, and fight the Gods. Then all the island trembles with their force, And the surrounding flood withdraws its course; But when, quite spent, they sink beneath their toil, And feel their pangs increas'd by this new foil, They vent their heavy groans, and fill the air, Through Ætna's mouth, with liquid flames that bear Defiance to the skies, and speak them smote, But not subdued;—all this has Ovid wrote,— As sweet a bard as ever touch'd the lyre:— Oh! that I had but one-tenth of his fire!— No less would do;—for mine no vulgar theme,— No love-sick ditty, poet-laureat's dream, Which may be said or sung from either end, And to the very self-same meaning tend; I'll deal in no provocatives to sleep, Give me the Reader who will laugh or weep; 'Tis sign he's touch'd in some part or another, Or else the poet's fire is all a smother; No matter so he's touch'd—My muse takes wing, And All the Talents she will strive to sing! Off, then, they set full tilt, in mock array, Knight, Squires, and Armour-bearers without pay, T'attack the Treas'rer, P?, who kept the prize, With hands unsoil'd, and undesiring eyes. He, like the serpent curl'd in mazy fold, Guarded the tree that bore Hesperian gold; Watch'd honestly the never-tasted prey, And, without profit, wasted life away: His honest mind, to virtue's precepts true, Despis'd the fury of the lawless crew; Firm as a rock, he to his purpose stood, And bore their pelting for the public good. P? was alone a host, the gate thrown wide, He, like another Ajax, stemm'd the tide;— Invited, and repulsed his feeble foes, Preferring missile war to close-hand blows. First F? advanc'd; in either hand he bore The tropes and figures of a wordy war; But in hyperbolè his chief strength lay, He shot his arrow too great length of way; The law of nations he would turn and twist— Grotius and Puffendorf —just as he list, Close at his heels came S?n, who reel'd Beneath the British Drama's spacious field; From which he threw quotations in a strain That show'd his lance was Irony's keen vein. Then strutted heavy G?y, slow dragging on His lab'ring sentences, and periods long; He now and then would strive to make a bound, And like a war-horse snort and paw the ground; But soon he'd sink (than camps more fit for dray) Into the dull, phlegmatic, plodding G?y. Next costive W?m flogg'd his hide-bound wit— The beast would kick, and give a little skit; But could not deviate from the old jog-trot, Whether on turf or road its master got:— War or bull-baiting—all alike to him, Whose deepest schemes were but a wise man's whim:— Affairs of Nootka-Sound, or Oczakow, The parent Lott'ry, or the Little-go, Slave-Trade or Volunteers—he dash'd at all— Oft roll'd in mud, as oft retriev'd his fall; Kept splashing on, annoying friends and foes— Elbowing these, he trod on t' others' toes. His counterpart, the Brewer, guards his rear, For guiles politic quitting guiles of beer, Eager to fall into the ranks—a Peer. W?d will talk, but when the bung is out Forth from his mouth nought else but froth will spout, Which, though all o'er his foes it madly flies, Fails not to splash his friends, and blind their eyes; For with the froth much grains and dregs you'll find, Like eloquence that is not well refin'd. Smirking, behold the prating egotist, The little lawyer, E?e;—“List! O, list!” READER. What does he talk about?— AUTHOR. —About himself;— What pity 'tis he's laid upon the shelf, Whose tongue can charm the ears of law-pluck'd pigeons, Who dive but can't escape, like luckless widgeons. Have ye not heard those sounds, which need must lure ye?— “My Luds—your Ludships—gemmen of the Jury.” Then follows a long string of legal pother, Itself sufficient common sense to bother; But when 'tis larded with Joe Miller's jest— Oh! 'tis a feast for fools of highest zest. Hear him but plead, reply, rejoin, demur, Rebut and Surrebut,—by G?! you'd swear The seven Grecian sages were combin'd To form this little body's wond'rous mind. But change the scene, nor leave the Chapel's walls, Down from his pinnacle the tom-tit falls. Who, in the morning, made the cobwebs dance, Which grace the K? B? Court, by dire mischance, At eve you'll find in H? of C? vext, Bewilder'd, lost, and e'en for words perplext; Nay once, so gravell'd was for lack of matter, He stoop'd as if he wanted to make water, And losing hums and hahs! (the long-robe trick) His last resource was crying:—“Sick, oh, sick!” No doubt he was—so Rochester, the wit, Was once before reduc'd to hawk and spit In the same place, because his speech, divided Into three branches, from his mem'ry glided, And left him, like our lawyer, plump aground:— But Rochester for no excuse look'd round— He honestly confess'd what was the case; That he had wander'd into a wrong place, And gave them leave, if there he branch'd again, To grub him root and branch up for his pain. The courtly wit was wise, the lawyer still Long'd with himself the chapel-walls to fill; 'Twas pity he'd no friend within the place, Who might have giv'n this hint to save disgrace:— “An ass spoke Hebrew in Judea's land, “Which dull old Balaam could not understand; “Throughout the land the ass's praises rung— “Thy greatest praise will be, to hold thy tongue.” These were the van and body of attack— The rear-guard, all who chose to join the pack. Deep-mouth'd and yelping on their prey they broke, Thinking to bear him down at ev'ry stroke; Snuff'd up each tainted gale, tried all their skill, To scent, to view, to turn, to seize, to kill. Through his financial windings close pursued, P? kept the open grounds, was mostly view'd; At times would proudly stand at bay, and keep The trembling pack afraid to mount the steep: Thus, in the Sinking-Fund, he made them halt, Then doubled, leaving them at a dead fault. The huntsman, Want, however urg'd them on, And Famine, whipper-in, flogg'd up the throng; Not staunch they were, but apt to break the ground, Whene'er another scent more fresh they found. Thus, when the Hastings, (India-laden ship,) Came cross the path, disdaining voice or whip, They left their former chace to share the spoil Of years' hard service, and of dang'rous toil. They thought that, like that beast which in death's throes Bites off and leaves behind the fatal cause To save its life; so Hastings would come down, Out of his wealth, to each some thousand pound. But here they were thrown out, and hung their ears After a tedious chace of seven years. Foaming with disappointment, on they flew In the old track—they'd had enough of new. When r?l malady their spirits cheer'd— Threaten'd that life to honest hearts endear'd, Their gloomy breasts with avarice were steel'd They shook the th?e, and all the country reel'd. How chang'd was then their tone—the mask fell off, And patriotism was their public scoff. 'Twas pow'r they wanted; but, too eager grasp'd, They lost it, and their arms a shadow clasp'd; The storm averted—grateful Britons praise The hand that lengthen'd out the r?l days. The Whigs thought fit to make a quick retreat To gather strength—(more desp'rate for defeat) And lurk like spiders to entrap their prey, If chance should bring them in their cobweb way. Not long they waited;—o'er a neighb'ring state Hung the dire portents of a ruthless fate; On Heaven's hand long vengeance seem'd to call, And public vice proclaim'd a public fall. When first the Revolution dawn'd in France, The British Whigs rejoic'd—it was a chance, Such as they wish'd for—desp'rate was their case, And troubled streams their only angling place. Then they became The People's Friends, forsooth! And talk'd the thing so vastly well, and smooth, They thought they should be made their guardians too, Should Johnny Bull get craz'd enough to sue A lunatic commission for the care As well of's person, as his worldly ware. Because the ministry for war were hot, The whigs as cool as cucumbers were got; Nay prophesied, like soothsayers of old, And all the dire effects of war foretold. What wondrous divination! Was it new, That war begets of evils not a few? An ideot might have sung the self-same strain, Of which the whigs were afterwards so vain. They took care not to say which was the worst— A foreign war, or civil strife accurst. Much moderation they assum'd—meek doves! Ready to change their principles as gloves. But when they found the public side with P?tt, Some other nice expedient must be hit; And, whilst they bawl'd against jacobinism, Took the right steps to raise a sim'lar schism 'Twixt king and people; they the latter grac'd With majesty— READER. —'Twas very oddly plac'd— AUTHOR. Yes; but 'twas new—the majesty o' th' mob Might the good people of their senses rob, Who, in their gen'rous fit, might condescend To be directed by the people's friend. Then would the ragged whigs sail into state, Like swans into a pond, with necks elate; Nor deign to stoop their heads, unless some fishes Should chance to catch their eyes, fit for their dishes; When gabbling, gobbling, each one for himself From Britain's bowels would extract his pelf. Posts, pensions, honours, on these beggars' backs Would sit as well as they on their new hacks, Yclep'd the Treas'ry Benches, could they mount 'em:— Thus folks, ere chickens hatch'd, do often count'em. The worst on't was, P? would not quit his seat, And to dismount him was no easy feat; Like Sisyphus's stones theirs would recoil, And stinging shame alone reward their toil. Yet they would on, and right or wrong condemn, To give P?'s ministry a requiem: And though they would not form a coalition With H?e T?'s jacobins, yet mad ambition Made them side-friends, they seem'd to be but one;— Both cried:—“Old England's Constitution gone!” Not more in substance could Tom Paine have said, Whose web compriz'd each foul sedition's thread. They moan'd our losses, our successes too, Because the latter into errors drew; At least they said so, for a reason plain— By neither could they get a penny's gain. Those politics for ever are the best, Which of the open day will bear the test; But if the cloven foot be once reveal'd, The eyes once opened can ne'er again be seal'd. Whene'er the whigs with wine or hope were drunk, 'Twas plain that patriotism was their punk, Us'd and abus'd, discarded or retain'd As her kind keepers found it shone or rain'd. 'Twas but a poor companion at the best, That would not entertain a single guest, Nor keep their Dî Penates in plain food— Who then would starve for the bare public good? Not whigs, who were, at public cost, for eating, Altho' they put a stop t' election-treating; No—the exchequer was a tempting chicken, Which still would yield a tolerable picking, If by the wind, their breath, the public stream Would wash off P?, and realize their dream. But the cabal of party soon was drown'd, When French invasion threaten'd British ground. A host of warriors—volunteers—took arms And to the royal standard flock'd in swarms, Laughing to scorn the vap'ring Gallic boast, Which ended in their strength'ning their own coast. Britain in danger! What a dire alarm! Enough the frozen blood of age to warm, T' awake the soul, and send it to the field To conquer, or to death alone to yield. Britain in danger! Magic's in that sound— Arm'd men spring up from ev'ry rood of ground, (As when the serpent's teeth did Cadmus sow)— Not to destroy each other, but the foe. O, what illustrious images arise When virtue a whole state electrifies! Posterity will read those scenes with pride! And second childhood, throwing crutch aside, Like uncle Toby, and brave corporal Trim, Will feel a fit of youth in ev'ry limb; Till, by their aches The Reader is most earnestly entreated not to torture this unfortunate word into Mr. Kemble's forced reading of “aitches,” as it will spoil the measure. reminded, back they sink To read again, to pause, and then to think— Then with new strength exclaim:—“Such times as these Were ne'er excell'd by the best Roman days!” READER. The public spirit merits all you've said— A state can never sink till that is dead. Whatever secondary props arise From schemes which crafty statesmen can devise, Yet certain 'tis, the manners of a land Produce its fall, or make it firmly stand. When rotten these, no politics can save, But quicker send corruption to its grave. AUTHOR. Forth from the mint of truth, no words more true Were ever drawn than those produc'd by you. With equal candour too, I hope to hear Why public manners are now black, now fair. READER. 'Tis my belief—the hue falls from above, As in the higher circles there may move Or State-Othello's, or White-Men in pow'r— As drops the dew from them, so thrives the flow'r. Corruption ne'er ascends, nor great men heed Th' example of the little—'tis a weed Engender'd first in Courts, whence it descends, And fills the kingdom to remotest ends; Nearer the source, the stream is more impure, As diff'rent channels drain the common sewer. AUTHOR. Those sentiments are mine—but you'll allow That virtue, too, in courts will often grow And spread its healthy shoots— READER. —Gently there— 'Tis found in courts, but often! not I fear. AUTHOR. Not as it should be—Well, shall I proceed? READER. I'm ready. AUTHOR. —Come then, Pegasus, my steed! Give us a flight somewhat beneath bombast But above dullness—Come, my knees are fast. Soon as Jacobinism— READER. —Pray, what is that? AUTHOR. Read then its origin—the tale is pat. THE ORIGIN OF A JACOBIN. AN ALLEGORY. ‘Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.’ Virg. Nature, once tir'd of having mortals made, And bent on pastime, for a while left trade, Trusting her stock to care of journeymen; Soon as her back was turn'd, the knowing elves Resolv'd to try to make a man themselves, Altho' ne'er known to knead the clay 'fore then. One, wiser than the rest, conceiv'd the joke, And thus each gaping brother-rogue bespoke:— “Brethren attend! I've somewhat to propose: Is it not hard that we for others toil? We do the work—Dame Nature reaps the spoil— Say—shall she ever lead us by the nose?” “What can we do?” bawls out a drawling wight. “Do!” cries the orator; “why do what's right; Convince our mistress she sha'n't use us so: Let's knead the clay, and straight a mortal make, That done, the honours of the trade partake, Henceforth in partnership—Nature and Co. “Huzza! Huzza!” No sooner said than done; With eagerness to work the blockheads run, Full of th'importance of their after-fame: Heads, legs, arms, trunk, et-cæt'ra, soon they make, Then chuckling cry: “Dame Nature, how she'll shake— Quick now, to finish, bring Promethean flame!” No sooner is th' enliv'ning torch applied, The statue moves—joy puffs out ev'ry side— How the rogues bellow, roar, and scream and grin! The mere machine th' admiring crowds survey, Which does the superficial man pourtray Without the soul;—then call him Jacobin. Their noisy screams their mistress' ear soon caught, She came, and saw the monstrous thing they'd wrought:— Joint grief and indignation rent her breast: Off to the council of the Gods she hied— The story told—the Jacobin denied To be her work, and enter'd her protest. READER. Thanks for your Allegory—pray proceed. AUTHOR. Soon as the Hydra had display'd its head, Whiggism reviv'd—just then almost a corse. Hid in the vast machine, like Grecian horse, They thought to storm that Troy, the Treasury Bench— Their thirst of pow'r, and avarice to quench, From P?tt's firm hand the helm could they once wrench. In vain they found a leak sprung in the Bank The critical situation of the Bank in 1797., P? stopp'd it first with some strong Council Plank Order of Council prohibiting the issue of any more specie., Then paid the seams with paper, seaman-like, And swore the ship should neither sink nor strike. In vain F? cried: “The public downfall's brewing And confidence in P? is certain ruin!” In vain was S?ff?k's motion to dismiss Those whose pernicious measures dug th' abyss:— In vain did G?y move Parliament's Reform, And Sh?d?n, another Proteus, storm About the Constitution's restoration To its pure state Mr. S?n declared that he supported the motion for parliamentary reform, because he thought it tended to restore to the people the purity of their excellent constitution, and to save the state from ruin.—“Non sum qualis eram!”—to save the sinking nation:— All would not shake the minister who stood Firm on Olympus' top, and at the brood Of modern giants hurl'd the Mr. P?tt's principal objection to a Parliamentary Reform, was, that it was brought forward at an improper season. times and seasons, With murders big—with stratagems and treasons. The people fear'd this war 'twixt Ins and Outs Like those phenomena, nam'd Waterspouts, Threaten'd destruction to the country's bark— Ne'er Britain's horizon was half so dark! True to his country—to his honour true, P? smil'd disdain on the tumultuous crew, Nor, like a worm, would grovel in the dust, Palsied by fear at all the clam'rous burst Of jealous party; no, he rais'd his head In conscious worth, not feeling aught like dread. From C?m, his fam'd sire, he did inherit His talents, genius, and unshaken spirit— Of Revolution's faction did withstand The rudest blast that ever shook this land;— When mutiny That at the Nore. rear'd up its hydra head, His single glance suffic'd to strike it dead; Deeds he oppos'd to words, rather to those Than these to trust, the prudent m?h chose; The public approbation stamp'd his choice, And voluntary off'rings The voluntary contributions made in aid of the ordinary mode of the raising Ways and Means, amounting to a million and a half. spake their voice. The Whigs, divided, from each other fell, Because the times were bad, or P?tt bade well. Those who had aught to lose, preferr'd to save it; P?'s boon bought others who thought fit to crave it. W?m obtain'd a place—a pension B?e, To do, what once they term'd, P?tt's dirty work. F?x, who aut Cæsar aut nullus would be, Scarce knew which best—to keep the field, or flee; Secession d?d The secession of the Whigs from their Parliamentary duty, under pretence that they could do no good— Pretty Shepherds to desert their flocks in any extremity! 'twere useless to repeat, John Bull would not be hook'd with such a bait. To clamour for him.—What was to be done? Blue devils haunted him—hopes there were none. And yet to honours loth to bid adieu, He cried:—“The candle of the state burns blue! “When plac'd in Revolution candlestick, “Best spermaceti with a goodly wick “Its light was bright and clear; but now 'tis dim— “And why?—The reason's plain,—P?tt cannot trim. “His ways and means are all so very shallow, “They only tend t' increase the waste of tallow; “And soon will end it, if —('tis the last stake!) “Me, as a save-all, you don't quickly take.”— This cry his few adherents join'd full loud, As mountebanks harangue the gaping crowd, In hopes, as these, by wonder-working tale, Gain for their body-saving drugs a sale, So they should blind the people with their tricks, And palm on them their nostrum politics. When all these schemes were vanish'd into air, Their expectations sunk into despair; For e'en the damn'd endure no greater pain, Than knowing there's a heaven they can't attain. What all their subtlety could ne'er effect, Was brought about when least they did expect. P?tt's resignation fann'd the expiring embers Of hopes within the opposition members. They vainly hop'd that then success was certain, But P?tt had only stepp'd behind the curtain. Where with a string he mov'd the puppet's jaws, And made the passive actor gain applause. Small things affect light heads, and A?n Thought he might well go on as he'd begun; Though P?tt, and all his friends should turn their backs, He'd skill, he hop'd, to parry their attacks: For having tasted once the luscious cup, He could not bring himself to give it up. Too strong was the temptation to resist— He'd keep his seat,—P?tt take it as he list. 'Twas ta'en in snuff,—the P?tt?s fell away— The whigs advanc'd in hopes of present pay. But their proceedings such disgust had giv'n, Great Jove was bent they ne'er should sit in heav'n. Once more repuls'd, with disappointment big, They measur'd back their steps with awkward jig;— Declar'd so weak was the administration, That 'twas impossible to save the nation, Unless a new one of broad-bottom'd size, Were fram'd, which all the talents should comprize, Of the whole country— READER. —Pray, whom did they mean? AUTHOR. Themselves—they made th' allusion very plain. The oddest things oft coupled are by chance, And P?tt and F?x now join'd in the same dance. Their aim the same—the minister to scout, And scuffle for his place, when he was out. Th' impending danger A?n foresaw, And summon'd all his art to ward the blow; Determin'd to stand out to his last drop, He seiz'd his pestle to defend his shop. Nor art, nor great Jove's favour could avail To make his sturdy enemies turn tail. The languid state o' the In 1804, Mr. F?x proposed a Committee to enquire into the measures recently adopted for the National Defence. Mr. P?tt concurred with him in terming them wholly inadequate, and Mr. A?n, finding himself unable to resist their united efforts, reluctantly quitted the helm. national defence Afforded for their junction a pretence. And A?n, unable to withstand, Quitted reluctantly the Promis'd Land. READER. Good heav'ns! What crooked beings statesmen are— How for each other lay the treach'rous snare! The public good, their stalking-horse, their game, Their private plunder, or their private fame. A patriot's but another name for rogue— AUTHOR. Hush! Not so harsh.—Decorum is the vogue. Whene'er a nation is on the decline, Its language softens—men seek to refine; A mutual feeling tenderness begets, And one forgives, as he's forgiv'n his debts. The honest terms, which healthy times will bear, Can't be endur'd when sickly ones appear; Crimes then are youthful follies; vice the ton, And public peculation but a loan; Borrow'd to be repaid— READER. —You're right enough, The times are made of just such rotten stuff. It makes me giddy to look down the steep— AUTHOR. 'Tis dang'rous then for honest men to sleep. Demosthenes dar'd hurl Philippics now, Lest some A?y G?l knit his brow; In vain would Ciceronian strains now clank 'Gainst modern Pisos, of Patrician rank; Their p?rs would screen them from the whip of law— Not guilty upon honour—heal the flaw. As sure defaulters are to be carest, As public wrongs are to go unredrest. But to go on:—When A?n was fled, P?tt took the helm—the whigs expected bread; But just as soon two suns might gild one sky, As P?tt with F?x consent to ride and tie. Thus foil'd once more, the whigs fell back again Into their ancient opposition train; 'Gainst P?tt, and friends, they more than ever rag'd, And war more secret—more successful wag'd. All have observ'd thro' what mysterious ways Kind Heav'n its blessings to mankind conveys: The struggles 'twixt the parties brought to light Deeds thought deep buried in the shades of night. An honest cheeld, bra' M?lv?e, ken you weel— A bairn plac'd uppermost on Fortune's wheel, A bonny Briton, (lords e'en may be knaves) A very slave with lords, a lord with slaves, Had plac'd the public money out to use, And of his talents made a good produce— READER. A faithful steward, and a Christian too— AUTHOR. Hold! He forgot to render Cæsar's due. READER. A knave! AUTHOR. —Not so.—Acquitted by his peers, The white-wash'd lord his blushing honours bears. Altho' impeach'd by commons, and debas'd— His name from privy-council-list eras'd; Yet, with a change of times, his unmask'd face, The honest peer would show again, in place. READER. When things are come to such a desp'rate pass, 'Tis plain, corruption poisons the whole mass; The state's decrepid—and its constitution, Manag'd by quacks, flies on to dissolution. AUTHOR. Pray Heav'n, your prophecy may not prove true! Altho' things wear a very sombre hue, Virtue may heal the wounds which vice has made— READER. Virtue is weak, when vice becomes a trade. AUTHOR. Still virtue is not an Elysian shade; From British Isles, despairing she's not flown; In British bosoms she retains her throne— Not a weak empty form Such as is described by Thomson:—The more the bold, the bustling, and the bad, Press to usurp the reins of pow'r, the more Behoves its virtue with indignant zeal, To check their combination. Shall low views Of sneaking int'rest, or luxurious vice, The villain's passions, quicken more to toil, And dart a livelier vigour thro' the soul, Than those that, mingled with our truest good, With present honour, and immortal fame, Involve the good of all?—An empty form Is the weak virtue, that, amid the shade, Lamenting lies, with future schemes amus'd, While wickedness and folly, kindred powers, Confound the World.— Lines to the Memory of Lord Talbot.,—but bold and firm; And yet may see of all her foes the term, Or foreign or domestic;—still may shake That red right-hand, will make them all to quake;— Curb French ambition—ministerial fraud, And make the wond'ring nations loud applaud. READER. Pray Heav'n it prove so! AUTHOR. —From my soul—Amen! Weak be each British foe, and strong each friend! But to go on:—Let's drop an honest tear On real worth and merit,—on P?tt's bier. Pow'r was his idol, not for power's name, But, for his country's, and for his own fame. Objects so laudable need no acclaim, When public good, not private ends, the aim. With the best Roman patriots he vied, For though he frugal liv'd, in debt he died; Died prematurely—Nature could no more— Incessant toil had drain'd out all her store. Farewell, thou great and honest man, farewell! Yet wilt thou e'er in British bosoms dwell. READER. He will indeed;—and the historic page Bestow that justice an ungrateful age Is slow to yield.— AUTHOR. —His elegy was wept Ere well with his forefathers he had slept. Exulting whigs, with haste indecent, block'd All avenues to pow'r, and overstock'd The ministerial common. To appease Their tedious fast, they swallow'd down with ease Each post of profit and of honour too;— No kennel witness'd such a famish'd crew. “So wolves, the faithful mastiffs gone, grow bold “And fiercely leap into th' unguarded fold: “The trembling flock they seize with eager claws, “And tear their mangled limbs with rav'ning jaws; “Till they stand panting with th' uneasy load, “O'ercloy'd with carnage, and oppress'd with blood.” READER. Men of dispatch they prov'd themselves at least, Admitted to a loaves and fishes' feast. AUTHOR. Granted they were; they seiz'd the public store, Then promis'd against thieves to shut the door: Public economy their chiefest end, Pence, shillings, pounds, they'd carefully attend, To Coventry all peculators send. READER. 'Twas a fair outset— AUTHOR. 'Twas indeed most fair; No better course they possibly could steer, To keep the public favour; they well knew Great Jove's antipathy to buff and blue, Which nothing could have forc'd him to gulp down, Could but one able P?tt?te have been found. There was not one,—P?tt left but shreds behind, Tossing about, the sport of ev'ry wind; They'd neither make, nor mend, nor line, nor face Th' administration cloak, in any case. 'Twas a hard drench— READER. —But wisdom to submit; The proudest war-horse owns the rein and bit, And to necessity e'en kings must bend. AUTHOR. Just so:—perforce the whigs must have their end:— On high Olympus' top the giants revel, Like horse-back'd beggars posting to the devil. Great Jove a swelling felt within his chest To see such forc'd supporters to his crest. But S?dm?th was at hand, and he prescrib'd Two drachms of patience and a smooth outside, Till the vulpinus morbus could be sent Again with good Duke Humphrey to keep Lent. Th' advice was politic and put in play, And nods and smiles were th' orders of the day, Whilst underneath the devil crouching lay. READER. In truth, this seems a dirty kind of life. AUTHOR. Like cat and dog, forever they're at strife. Each thinks his services deserve the most; All keep court calendars—know ev'ry post. One vacant falls, and they fall by the ears, Crowds of intriguers block up the back stairs; Friends, mistresses, wives, daughters, put in play— The bubble honour's broke to win the day. READER. If so with single posts; what must ensue, When all th' old brooms are to make for new? AUTHOR. That you'll ne'er know, unless by lucky chance Asmodeus you should free from vile durance; Who, taking off the roofs, might let you peep Into great houses, just like pens of sheep. One change of ministry a book would make, Which should “The Devil upon two Sticks” shake. READER. Th' idea's good—some bookseller will seize it— Tickle the public, and you're sure to please it. AUTHOR. If in a laughing humour; but the case Is not so now; right reverend grimace Is fashion's mask, and protestant lank locks Are to supplant gay whigs, and popish blocks. The precedent, from musty records drawn, Through lawyer P?l abroad has flown; And the most glorious bonfires may ensue The cry reviv'd:—“no pop'ry, and true blue!” But we're before our story; let's go back, And see the talents mounted on their hack. Being the people's friends, they thought 'twas fair, That of the people's friends they should take care. The loaves and fishes were divided soon, Each more or less contented with his boon. If any grumbled—with a public sop, The rest took care their discontent to stop. 'Twas— “Sir, your talents are above all price; “Here is an untouch'd loaf—pray take a slice— “My lord, your place is not a sinecure— “Do take another fish L?d H?k complained that the business of his office had multiplied, and procured the salary to be rais'd from three to five thousand a year. Yet this was the man who once said, during the debates on the P? of W?s's establishment, that the only way to sccure the government, was to render it as little oppressive as possible to the people.—But he was then only plain Mr. G?y.—you're welcome, sure.” Their fast thus broke, a miracle was wrought— READER. Baskets of fragments left? AUTHOR. —Faith, they left nought; E'en lick'd the plates; but by a wond'rous charm, The ministerial benches scarce were warm Beneath their pressure, when their magic rumps Had totally dispell'd the public dumps. The nation, which, but one short month before, Had been by them proclaim'd at ruin's door, Was now most flourishing— READER. What had they done?— AUTHOR. I've told you all.— READER. No other deeds? AUTHOR. —Not one. READER. That was a miracle indeed!— AUTHOR. —Aye such, None in the Romish catalogue can touch. The veni, vidi, vici, Cæsar's boast, In this grand gasconade was wholly lost. But something must be done to prop the fame Of all the Talents—their adopted name. And F?x was striving hard to make a peace When ruthless death bade all his labours cease. READER. Another loss for Britain!— AUTHOR. —'Twas indeed: From all his youthful prejudices freed, F?x might have prov'd himself his country's friend, But what heav'n does is all for some wise end. Like P?tt's, his colleagues of their head bereft Scarcely could tell their right hand from their left; But they resolv'd with both to keep their hold And to the last the Treas'ry Bench t' enfold. They knew in what predicament they stood, As servants by a jealous master view'd; And therefore strove, by way of counterpoise, T' excite the people to a little noise. What signify the means, if good the end? These interested views good did attend: And wholesome measures Such as the abolition of the African Slave Trade;—The formation of a Committee for reducing sinecure and useless offices, and for diminishing the unnecessary expences of the state;—and a new disposition of the financial resources of the country, which, however, was but a slice of P?tt's sinking fund system. flow'd from source impure, As to some poisons others are a cure. But still it was remark'd, no more was said 'Bout lopping off corruption's hydra head; Of rotten boroughs—radical reform; Subjects on which they'd formerly been warm. No more they sang the Majesty of Mobs, Of ministerial tools, and dirty jobs. The H?e of C?s was not now that place, They once had stigmatiz'd with such disgrace, As if unworthy In the debate, in 1797, on Mr. G?y's motion for a parliamentary reform, the following were the words of Lord (then Mr.) E?ne:—“The virtue, spirit, and essence of a H?e of C?s consist in its being the express image of the feelings of a nation. It was not instituted to be a controul upon the people, as of late it had been taught, but a controul for them. A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy— an anxious care of public money—an ear open to public complaint— these are the true characteristics of a H?e of C?s. But an addressing H?e of C?s, and a petitioning nation; a H?e of C?s full of confidence, when the nation is plung'd in despair; in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regard with abhorrence; who vote thanks when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachment; who are eager to grant, when the general voice demands reckoning and account; who, in all disputes between the people and administration, decide against the people; who punish their disorders, but refuse to inquire into their provocations; this is an unnatural, a monstrous state of things in this constitution. And this (added Mr. E?e) is the degraded, and disgraceful state of this assembly at this moment.”— I would ask his Lordship whether any alteration was made or ever talked of whilst he sat upon the W?l S?k? of an honest face. The People's Friend did now that term disown; Friends of Subordination they were grown: T?ke, and B?tt no longer they did know; Honores mutant mores—so times flow. They were content to keep things as they found'em, Why should they change, when all was snug around'em? They'd what they wanted—things were well enough, And Reformation was seditious-stuff; Administration must perforce command Majorities, and rotten boroughs stand. READER. When was't not thus?—Like waves by waves pursued, One brood of wasps b' another is renew'd, What is the reason of't?— AUTHOR. —The reason's plain: A minister has two ways to enchain A p?t; Elections Mr. Burgh, in his excellent Political Disquisitions, makes this very observation, and adds that the chief materials by which a minister keeps up an ascendancy in parliament are: 1. The prodigious sum of public money of which he has the disposal: 2. The innumerable places in the customs, excise, salt duty, &amp;c. in the navy, army, and church, the greatest part of which are at the disposal of the minister. Latter times have thrown into the ministerial scale a weight unknown to former ages; I mean the national debt. The anxiety of the public creditors, the proprietors of the funds, about public credit, is a powerful cause of their shewing a reluctance against all proposals for salutary alterations, or restorations. But their reasonings on this subject are not sounder than it would be for the inhabitant of a crazy building to oppose all repairs, and to insist that the best way for preventing his mansion from coming in ruins upon his head is to let it fall. Secret service is a huge cloak thrown over an immense scene of corruption, and under this cloak we must not peep. Our court-men tell us, there must be large sums expended in this way, and those sums cannot be accounted for; because the service done for them must never be known. But we find that the Commons, A. D. 1708, address'd Qucen Anne for accounts of pensions paid for secret service to members of parliament, or to any persons in trust for them, and that the Queen ordered said account to be laid before the house. Contracts are a great fund of ministerial influence. It is well known that our ministers do not accept the most reasonable offer; but the offer which is made by those who have the greatest parliamentary interest; and that, in war time, every man, who furnishes for the government, is enrich'd; in France the contrary; which shews that we manage our public money much worse than the French ministry do theirs. In the late war it is notorious that several of our purveyors and commissaries got estates sufficient to set them up for earls and dukes. But as Bishop Burnet says of his own times—the regard that is shewn to members of parliament among us, causes that few abuses can be inquired into, or discovered. To these sources of ministerial influence, Mr. Burgh, also adds a civil list of one million per annum increased by pretended deficiencies or debts; lotteries, &amp;c. and latter times have much increased the catalogue. he o'errules, And bribes the members to become his tools. Hence on the body politic the wounds bestow'd Thro' which the constitution's blood has flow'd. READER. No wonder, then, that virtue yields to vice, When ev'ry honest member has his price: So Walpole said; 'twas he first gave the blow, That, oft repeated, sinks the nation low. AUTHOR. You err a little,—he was not the first Lord Chesterfield, in his character of Sir Robert Walpole, makes use of the following terms: ‘Money, not prerogative, was the chief engine of his administration; and he employed it with a success which in a manner disgraced humanity. He was not, it is true, the inventor of that shameful mode of governing, which had been gaining ground insensibly ever since Charles II.; but, with uncommon skill and unbounded profusion, he brought it to that perfection, which at this time dishonours and distresses this country, and which (if not checked, and God knows how it can be checked) must ruin it. Besides this powerful engine of government, he had a most extraordinary talent of persuading and working men up to his purpose. A hearty kind of frankness, which sometimes seemed impudence, made people think that he let them into his secrets, whilst the impoliteness of his manners seemed to attest his sincerity. When he found any body proof against pecuniary temptations, which, alas! was but seldom, he had recourse to a still worse art; for he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of public virtue, and the love of one's country, calling them, “The chimerical school-boy flights of classical learning;” declaring himself, at the same time, “No Saint, no Spartan, no Reformer.” He would frequently ask young fellows, at their first appearance in the world, whilst their honest hearts were yet untainted:—“Well, are you to be an old Roman? a patriot? You will soon come off of that, and grow wiser.”—And thus he was more dangerous to the morals than to the liberties of his country, to which I am persuaded he meant no ill in his heart. It is strange that statesmen should prefer a few temporary advantages to the detestation of posterity!—; But he struck home the treach'rous barb accurst. In Charles the Second's days, the pension'd tribe, First seiz'd with open mouths the deadly bribe: King William's bad advisers made him think The practice needful, or his pow'r would sink; Ann's ministry pursued the embryo plan, But then irreg'lar;—Walpole was the man To render it a system; from his time, The theory and practice constant chime. Venality holds up its golden dream— Lost is the balance—justice kicks the beam. No longer parliament with C?n contends; Nor lords and commons strive for diff'rent ends; All are embodied,—fall into the ranks, And from the people stand—a strong phalanx; Whose int'rests, views, and habits are the same, For int'rest is the stake for which they game; And mutual int'rest renders men so mild, That a brib'd patriot is like a child. Each ministry, whene'er they take the lead, Bestow on their dependents daily bread; Tell you the politic millennium's come, And hasten on the country to its doom. And, though the times are bad as 'twere a dearth, Would have you think—the Just now reign on earth. So floats the bubble on the treach'rous stream Until it bursts, and lost is then the dream! No other Hercules can deal a blow, Except Reform, the monster to o'erthrow. READER. When will that honest minister be found, Who'll undertake to heal this canc'rous wound? AUTHOR. Aye, when, indeed! The second race of Titans— The patriotic whigs were not the right ones. Those, who in opposition poverty, had made Such noise about it, slyly did evade All talk of reformation, when in pow'r:— Nay more,—elections, Freedom's fairest flow'r, More than the blighting Walpole they mildew'd, And with their mangled limbs their passage strew'd. READER. May Heav'n repay them— AUTHOR. —And their country too! Already they've had somewhat of their due. But to the fact:—As vanity is blind, When F?x was gone—no like had left behind— The hypocritic S?n conceiv'd That in himself the loss might be retriev'd; At least, he wish'd th' idea to impress On Westminster electors, with success. Throughout the city, nothing then was heard Of F?x's talents, and his bushy beard; 'Cause S?n's abilities transcendant, Mouth'd by his friends, had gotten the ascendant. As'twere by metonymy, F?x's shade Stood for himself—'Twas F?x in masquerade. Some few were blinded—most laugh'd at the jest— READER. A sad burlesque! I wonder F?x could rest E'en in the grave; 'twas much he had not burst The bonds of death, and from the hustings thrust His mimic representative— AUTHOR. —His ghost Did not go unreveng'd: P?ll rais'd a host Of B?rd?tt's friends, who S?n unmask'd, And the apostate patriot roundly task'd. The hustings scarce sustain'd his weight, before He heard the public indignation roar. He started, and could scarce believe his ears;— Look'd round, but nothing saw to ease his fears. With popularity went oil of tongue, Which with self-praise had otherwise well rung. The constitution's purity rejected; By fair, or foul means, he would be elected. The public cash in rivulets ran down, In muddy streams, the public voice to drown. The ministerial cabinet Mr. W?tb?d, in his examination on oath before the Committee appointed to try the merits of the Westminster election, deposed that all the cabinet ministers had subscribed towards Mr. S?n's expences under fictitious names, except lord E?ne, who could not but be aware what a scandalous impeachment such a transaction, if brought to light, would bring upon his high official situation. subscrib'd And voters were cajol'd, or else proscrib'd. The H?r A?pp?t Mr. G?y also deposed that 500l. subscribed was the money of H? R? H? The P? of W? Quid fulurum sit! too threw in his mite. READER. Into futurity, what dark insight! I shudder at the prospect, as I peep, Like Edgar overhanging Dover's steep. Corruption's flood shall deluge all the land— (Better 'twere cover'd o'er like Goodwin sand,) A civil war rear its unnat'ral head, And desolation, like a fiend, o'erspread. AUTHOR. Pray Heav'n avert such a disastrous fate, And open statesmen's eyes ere 'tis too late! The body's sound, and if it do not sink Into lethargic sleep, upon the brink Of this dread precipice, things may end well; But if it should, then Britain hear thy knell! “Debas'd and sunk by depredating knaves, “Thou'lt harbour only millions of rank slaves.”— But if thou'rt wise and patient—and yet firm, Thy miseries will one day have a term; Th' oppressive load insensibly be dropp'd, And vital circulation no more stopp'd: Vigour will be renew'd—thy nerves be strong, Thy happiness triumphant,—lasting long. READER. O, may these halcyon days our offspring bless! We ne'er can hope such blessings to possess. AUTHOR. No;—reformation is a work of time, And to effect it, many things must chime. Vice must decrease, and as its stream departs, Virtue must fill the inlets to our hearts. But truce to future prospects: craft obtain'd Th' ascendancy, and S?n now reign'd:— But short the triumph; just as it was o'er, The haughty Titans tried their strength of pow'r Against Jove's will—and boldly strove to gain A point Lord H?k brought in a bill for partial Catholic emancipation, by allowing them to fill the highest naval and military offices without taking the oath of Supremacy., which even P?tt could not attain. The die was cast,—their downfall was prepar'd; They heard the distant thunder, and were scar'd: They dropp'd th' obnoxious measure to retain Places and popularity,—in vain. They must leave off each former prank and trick, And promise ne'er against Jove's will to kick. 'Twas not expected that they would submit, And ready stood the satellites of P?tt And all the outs,—a very num'rous host, Who wish'd Jove's countenance, and some fat post; Ready t' expel if they refus'd to yield. Hard terms to stay, hard terms to quit the field! They hesitated; but the eager crew Of Jovites could not wait,—to arms they flew. P?tl?d, who lay in wait behind the th?e, At lordly Gr?nv?lle hurl'd a massive stone, Which sunk him down to earth; made P?y reel: Which, P?rc?l perceiving, caught his heel, And with a firebrand made him glad to dance, After friend Gr?lle down the vast expanse. E?sk?e and E?n would not fight, because To keep, not break the peace, the end of laws; So E?ne, finding opposition vain, Resign'd the w?ls?k much against the grain, And not before the proudest of his host Were wholly routed, and the day nigh lost. The Jovites, fir'd by P?rc?l's success, With firebrands arm'd, the Titans to distress. D?nd?s encounter'd T?rn?y, face to face, Both arm'd in brass; but T?rn?y met disgrace. R?se seiz'd on Sh?n, who had just sunk Into a sleepy fit—that is, dead drunk; And pitch'd him headlong from Olympus' top, Into a luckless brandy-merchant's shop. The pompous C?er?h prepar'd t' attack The no less pompous W?dh?m, on the back Of his high war-horse, but ere they could charge, A book struck W?dh?m's head—“statutes at large”— By the sage P?rc?v?l, with both hands thrown, And knock'd him off his hobby with a groan. The Titan force retreated,—M?x last, Who to his piece of ordnance stuck fast, Defying C?th?m's efforts to obtain it, Whether by art, or force, he strove to gain it. Now down to earth the Titan talents driv'n,— Jove, to prevent their rising against Heav'n, The pond'rous Portland Isle upon them threw: He might expel, but not subdue the crew. The reason of their fall they public made— What did the public care? They were a trade— A stock,—commodity,—a piece of land— That's sold and bought,—transferr'd from hand to hand. So often thus through diff'rent hands they'd past, The next possessor welcome as the last; Things might amend, but could not well be worse;— The stream must flow, so let it take its course. The Titans wish'd the lesser mortal's aid— Not then to carry on the war afraid. To show their spirit, and their foes to hurt, They belch'd towards high Heav'n a loud report. The shot, delinquency, sore wounded St?le, And would have made a greater person reel, Had not the w?ls?k damp'd its furious force, And dissolution This last struggle displayed all the intrigue and address of both parties; but the relics of P?tt's party, who had mostly join'd the new administration, were too well practised in public business for their adversaries. The Committee for inspecting military accounts had discovered a deficiency of nearly 20,000l. in the hands of a former paymaster, the Hon. Mr. St?le, and the new ministry thought proper to delay the report, because, as it is whispered, the money would have been traced to higher hands. The Whigs hastened the report, and were actually waiting in the H?e of C?s to present it, when the Speaker entered, dissolved the parliament, and consequently, stifled the report for the present. What will be the end of all this? turn'd aside its course. READER. Thus 'tis—the Outs strive hard to bring to light Whate'er the Ins wish buried under night. The Ins may prove successful for a while, But time may open further scenes of guile. AUTHOR. And doubtless will;—to leave th' enquiry free, Great Jove stands pledg'd; and daring must they be, Who will henceforth advise him to retract, Though by a superstitious frenzy back'd. READER. Some good, howe'er, the whigs have brought about. AUTHOR. That matter, sir, will not admit a doubt; And lamentable 'tis they turn'd aside From gen'ral questions; on which had they tried Their skill, they yet might have retain'd the helm, And prob'd the wounds which pang'd the sickly realm. But now the politic horizon's gloom'd, And seems to bigotry unfeeling doom'd. The new administration have begun A mad career, they never long can run. Knowing their want of skill and resolution, The p?rl?t was cast for dissolution; And P?rc?v?l prefac'd the new election;— “No Popery, and Protestant protection!” Should thus l?d G?n's tragedy revive,— Should it—said I?—Already 'tis alive! In the cities of Liverpool and Bristol, the most disgraceful scenes have already attended the elcctions commenced under this system of terror. On some provincial boards has been brought out, And many heads still carry it about. Such wicked weakness ne'er can serve the turn, Though bigot fires throughout the kingdom burn. Th' alarm is wanton too; the cause withdrawn, The cath'lics have more moderation shown Than our bless'd Protestant administration, Who (send them wits!) are to preserve the nation! But since with bonfires they commence their reign, The Titans may Olympus' top regain;— Throw off the Portland-Isle, which keeps them down, And prove much better servants of the C?n. From such an outset, good can't be expected; But, still we'll shew how it may be effected:— Let them avoid the dire Walpolian schemes, And ne'er defile the Constitution's streams; Permit inquiry to go shackles-free, Nor screen delinquents, who to them may flee For their protection:—Let them walk upright, And, like good, honest guardians, play in sight;— Strive to decrease the national expence, And, as their own, take care of public pence;— Be moderate, yet firm, towards our foes, And, when they safely can, the contest close;— This moral deeply on their hearts engrave;— 'Tis virtue only can a nation save. Then may they justly claim the public praise, And higher powers, should these deeds displease, And make them lose their posts;—a nation's love Sweet recompence for such a loss will prove.</field>
