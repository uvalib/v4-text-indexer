      <field name="fulltext">These are the many-coloured beads of life; Blame me not, gentle reader, if their hues Should please thee little, for I did but choose And thread them where I found them, by the strife Of Time's great ocean cast upon the shore— Stay Thou with me awhile, and tell them o'er.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHRISTINA. Father, when I am in my grave, kind Father, Take thou this cross,—I had it from a girl,— Take it to one that I will tell thee of,— Unto Christina. I may not part with it while I have life; I kept it by me, treasured it through years Of evil, when I dared not look upon it; But of the love and reconciling mercy Whereof it is a token, now it speaks. Sore bitten by the fiery flying serpent, Yet have I strength to raise my languid eyes, And fix them on that sign, for sin uplift Within the wilderness, and there my gaze— My straining gaze—will fasten to the last, Death-glazed, upon it. Oh! may then my soul Be drawn up after it unperishing! Thou knowest of my life, that I have been Saved as by fire,—a brand plucked from the burning; But not before the breath of flame had passed On all my garments, not before my spirit Shrunk up within it as a shrivelled scroll Falls from the embers, black,—yet unconsumed, For One in Heaven still loved me, one on earth. O Father, I would speak to thee of Love; We learn the price of goodliest things through losing. They who have sat in darkness bless the light, And sweetest songs have risen to Liberty From souls once bound in misery and iron; So, Father, I would speak to thee of Love. Fain are my lips, and fain my heart to sing The glad new song that both have learned so late. Once, ere my soul had burst the fowler's snare, I heard a wild stern man, that stood and cried Within the market-place; a man by love Of souls sent forth among the lanes and highways, To seek, and haply save, some wandering one Long strayed, like mine, from flock, and fold, and pastor. His words were bold and vehement; as one Set among flints, that strove to strike a spark From out dull, hardened natures. Then he used The terrors of the Lord in his persuading; Death, Judgment, and their fearful after-looking, Grew darker at his words: “How long,” he said, “O simple ones, will ye be fain to follow Hard service and hard wages—Sin and Death? Now, the world comes betwixt your souls and God; Here, you can do without Him and be happy; He speaks to you by love, ye put Him by; But He will speak to you by wrath, and then Vain will it be to shun Him, to forget— In the next world ye may not do without Him: Seek God, run after Him, for ye must die!” Oh! then, I thought, if one like me might speak, If I might find a voice, now would I raise A yet more bitter and exceeding cry, “Seek God, run after Him, for ye must live! I know not what it may be in that world, The future world, the wide unknown hereafter, That waits for us, to be afar from God; Yet can I witness of a desolation That I have known; can witness of a place Where spirits wander up and down in torment, And tell you what it is to want Him here.” I had no friends, no parents. I was poor In all but beauty, and an innocence That was not virtue—failing in the trial. Mine is a common tale, and all the sadder Because it is so common: I was sought By one that wore me for a time, then flung Me off; a rose with all its sweetness gone, Yet with enough of bloom to flaunt awhile, Although the worm was busy at its core. So I lived on in splendour, lived through years Of scorning, till my brow grew hard to meet it; Though all the while, behind that brazen shield, My spirit shrank before each hurtling arrow That sang and whistled past me in the air. On every wall methought I saw a Hand Write evil things and bitter; yea, the stones Took up a taunting parable against me. I looked unto the right hand and the left, But not for help, for there was none would know me, I knew that no man carèd for my soul; Yet One in heaven still loved me, one on earth! But being then unto myself so hateful, I deemed that all did hate me, hating all;— Yet one there was I hated not, but envied, A sad, despairing envy, having this Of virtue, that it did not seek to soil The whiteness that it gazed upon, and pined. For I had loved Christina! we had been Playmates in innocent childhood; girlish friends, With hearts that, like the summer's half-oped buds, Grew close, and hived their sweetness for each other. She was not fair like me unto the eye, But to the heart, that showed her by its light Most lovely in the loveliness of love. I parted from her on Life's cross-road, where I parted from all good; yet even then, Had prayers and tears prevailed, we had not parted. Long after me I heard her kind voice calling, “Return!” yet I went on;—our paths struck wide, As were the issues that they led to, then She lost me, but I never lost her: still Across the world-wide gulf betwixt us set My soul stretched out a bridge, a slender hair, Whereon repassing swiftly to and fro, It linked itself unseen with all her lot, Oft seeking for a moment but to lose The bitter consciousness of self, to be Aught other e'en in thought than that I was. I took a portion of her innocent life Within myself; I watched her in her ways, Unseen I looked upon her in her home, Her humble home. Yes; I that once had scorned At lowly poverty and honest love, I know not if it were its joys or sorrows I envied most! Her tears were like the dew That lies all night upon the fruitful field That Heaven hath blessed, and rises there again. I was like blasted corn shrunk up and mildewed, Like sere, dry grass upon the house-tops growing, Whereof the mower filleth not his arms, Nor he that bindeth up his sheaves his bosom. Earth, earth methought and Heaven alike refused me; None gave me the kind wish, the holy word. I had no joys, no griefs; yet had I joyed, Then none had said, “God bless thee!” had I grieved, Then none that passed had said, “God pity thee!” I said, Christina wept. Within her home There was one only little one, a girl: Oft had I marked her playing in the sunshine, Oft by the hearth-light on her father's knee I watched her (little did Christina think Who stood without), but she was taken from her, This child of many prayers and hopes: I saw The little bier borne forth; this tender flower That Love had nursed so warm, yet could not keep, Did seem to leave a blank where it had been. Christina wept; but still as one whose tears Rained inward on her heart, whence rising oft They filled her eyes, but did not overflow them: For still she moved about the house, serene, And when her husband sought his home at eve She met him now, as ever, with a smile, So sweet, I know not if he missed its joy. But oft I tracked her thoughts unto a field, Quiet, yet populous as the city round it— Thick sown with graves; yet there the mother's heart Had marked a place, and there her constant feet Had worn a path. At early morn, I knew Oft went she by the grave to weep unseen, So oft at night-fall there I scattered flowers, The fairest and the sweetest I could find. I thought, she will not know whose hand hath strewed them, So wonder and a loving guess may cheat Her mind, a moment taking it from grief. I stood beside that grave one summer night; The skies were moonless, yet their dusk serene Was grateful to my spirit, for it seemed To wrap me from the world, myself, and heaven; And all the air was soft and cool, methought It kissed my cheek as if it were a child That loved me,—sinless, shrinking not from sin. Old legends say, that when the faithful join On holy Sabbaths with one fervent voice, Then doth prevailing prayer hold back awhile The edge of torment, and the lost have rest. So then, perchance, some gracious spirit wept, And prayed for sinners, for the voices died, The wailing ones, the mocking, at my heart; And through the hush came up a wish, a yearning— I know not where it took me—not to heaven,— Yet, had I ever prayed, it had been then; I sought not death, for that were but a change Of being, and a passage to a world Where thought would after me to hunt and vex, But to cease utterly to be, to find A place among the rocks, among the stones, With things that lived not, that would never live, To pass absorbed, and be at rest for ever. So stood I, holding in that trance the flowers, A wreath of white Immortelles, that as yet I hung not on the gravestone, when I heard A sudden step, and was aware that one Had come upon me in the gloom; I felt A grasp upon my arm, detaining kindly, A hand that sought to fold itself in mine: Before she spoke, I knew it was Christina. “And who art thou, with charitable hand Such kindness showing to the dead, the living? Now let me look upon thy face, for long My soul hath deemed of thee as of the angels That come and go unseen, and only traced By deeds that show some gracious Presence near; Yet, surely thou art one whom earth hath taught Through sorrow and through love this gentleness With grieving hearts, with stricken ones; from mine The blessing of the sorrowful be on Thee!” But at her words a madness took my soul; They seemed to mock me; falling one by one Like gracious drops upon my heart, they smote Its stagnant waters, stirring there no spring Of life or wholesomeness; yet were they stirred. Now would I speak with her, the fire was kindled; Long had it smouldered, long enough consumed me. Now by its flashes she shall read my soul Methought, and look upon me as I am; So, with a gesture of the hand, I led Christina, following on my rapid steps Like an unquestioning child, as if my will Had power to draw her, till within the door Of the great Minster passing, in the aisle's Dim light we stood, together and alone. Oft had I shunned Christina; now beneath A steadfast lamp that burned before a shrine, Confronting her, I said, “Now look on me;— Where is the blessing that thou spakest of?” But to my words she answered not; methought She did not catch their import—so her gaze Was fastened on me—then her very soul Gave way in tears; she took me in her arms,— Me, wretched me, that never thought to feel, In this world, or the after one, again Such pure embrace around me; to her heart, That heaved as if it could not hold a joy Made out of such an anguish, close she pressed me, And, sobbing, murm'ring to herself or heaven, In language half articulate, the words Came broken: “I have found thee! I have found thee!” “What hast thou found, Christina?” then I said, And with the words unto my lips arose A laugh of bitterness, whose mocking tones Through all the dreary hollow of my heart Woke up the echoes of its desolation; “What hast thou found? Speak not to me of her Whose name perchance thy lips are framing now,— The Magdalene; my life hath been as hers But not my heart, for she loved much—for this The more forgiveness meeting; I love none!” But then Christina pointed to the flowers Still hanging on my arm; “Thou lovest none!” And gently laid upon my mouth her hand, A soft restraining curb that now my speech, Like an ungovernable steed sore stung And goaded into frenzy, spurned aside, And sprang the wilder; “None, not even thee!” I cried; but then the whiteness of her face Smote on my spirit, taming scorn to sadness. “Why should I vex thee with my words; of love I know but as I know of God, of good, Of hope, of heaven, of all things counted holy— Know only by their names, for nought in me Gives witness to their natures; so, to speak Of them is but to take their names in vain. Oft hast thou told me how souls hang on God Like leaves upon a gracious bough, that draw Their juices from its fulness; long ago Mine fell from off that Tree of Life, thereon Retaining not its hold;—a withered leaf It lies, and bears the lightning's brand upon it.” “Yea, truly,” said Christina, “it may bear The spoiler's mark upon it, yet, like His Daniel iv. Of whom the Scriptures tell us, may thy soul (A watcher and an Holy One befriending) Have yet a root within the earth; though bound About with brass and iron, still the dews Lie on it, and the tender grass around Is wet with tears from heaven; so may it spring Once more to greenness and to life, for all The years it felt the pressure of the band So close and grievous round it.” But I cried, “There is no root! a leaf, a withered leaf, Long tossed upon the wind, and under foot Of men long trodden in the streets and trampled,— God will not gather it within His bosom!” “And who art thou that answerest for God? Now from this mouth of thine will I condemn thee; For, saying that thou knowest nought of love, How canst thou judge of Him whose name it is?” But here she clasped her fervent hands, and all The sternness melted from her: “Look on me, A sinner such as thou,—yet I have loved thee; Remembering thee above my mirth, how oft Beside the cheerful board that Heaven had blessed, I ate my bread in heaviness; and then Had I known where to seek thee, had risen up And left my food untasted, till I brought Thee in to share it; to my lips thy name Rose never, so I feared some bitter word Might chide it back within my wounded heart, That shut it in from blame; but then my prayers Grew dearer to me, for the thought that here, In this pure Presence only, could I meet thee; Here only to the Merciful could name thee, Could love thee, plead for thee without rebuke. Yes! even in my sleep my quest went on; Through dreams I ever tracked thee, following hard Upon thy steps, pursuing thee, and still Before I reached thee (thus it is in dreams) Came somewhat sundering us, and I awoke With tearful eyes, and on my lips half-framed Some loving word,—recalling so the past, I thought thou couldst not turn from it away. Yes! I have loved thee, I, a poor weak woman, One like to thee, yet holding in my heart— That else were dry and barren to all good— One drop of love from out of God's great ocean. And thinkest thou that we can love each other As He loves us,—as He that made us loves us? And sayest thou, ‘I am cast out from God?’ No! He hath lovèd thee from everlasting, Therefore with loving-kindness will He draw thee Oft doth He chide, yet earnestly remember, Long waiting to be gracious: come, poor child,— Thy brethren scorn thee, come unto thy Father! Away from Him, in that far country dwelling, Long hast thou fed upon the husks, too long Hast hungered sore, while no man gave unto thee; But there, within thy Father's house, is Bread Enough and still to spare, and no upbraiding. My little Child, my Innocent, that scarce Had left His arms, nor angered Him, nor grieved, Was not so welcome back to them as thou; Even now, a great way off, even now He sees thee, And comes to meet thee—rise and go to Him! The home is distant, but the way is nigh. Oh, Thou who, dying, madest us a way, Who, living, for us keepest ever open That access to the Father, look on us!” So speaking solemn, looking up to Heaven, She knelt down where we stood; upon my knees Beside her drew me; holding both my hands Firm folded 'twixt her own, she lifted them Towards the Mercy-seat; within her arms She held me still, supporting me; it seemed As then the very fountains of her soul Were broken up within her; so she wept, So pleaded: “Jesu, Lamb of God, O Thou The Father's righteous Son, that takest all The sin of earth away, have mercy on us!” But I was passive in her arms, I knew She wrestled sorely for me; yet as one That feels in heavy dreams a strife go on, And may not stir a finger, by the chain Of slumber compassed; so my torpid soul Slept numb, yet conscious, till within my heart, That had no movement of its own, but rose Upon Christina's heart that heaved beneath it, At length this miracle of love was wrought: Her spirit lay on mine, as once of old The Prophet on the little clay-cold child Outstretched, through warmth compelling warmth again, And o'er the chaos of the void within A breath moved lightly, and my soul stretched out Its feelers darkly, as a broken vine Puts forth its bruisèd tendrils to the sun: A mighty yearning took me, and a sigh Burst from my bosom, cleaving for my soul A way to follow it, and in that hour Methought I could have died, and known no pain In parting from the body; then I cried, “Oh, turn Thou me, and so shall I be turned!” When we arose up from our knees, her face Was calm and happy, then she kissed me, saying, “I call thee not my Sister, as of old, But come with me unto my home, and there Be thou unto me even as a Daughter, In place of her God gave and took again,— So hath He given thee to me.” Thus she spoke, And drew me on constraining; but my soul Held other counsel, minded in itself That I would look upon her face no more; Though all my soul clave unto her, as he From whom our Lord drave out the vexing demon, Had followed fain upon his steps for ever, So had I tarried by her well content; And yet I answered her, “Entreat me not, This may not be, yet fear not thou for me; I go upon my way, that crosses thine Perchance no more; so give me counsel now Upon my journey, for, as thou hast said, The home I seek is far away, the road Is strait and narrow, hard for erring feet Like mine to walk in.” Then Christina said, “I can but give thee counsel in the words Of Him our Master, ‘Go and sin no more!’ Keep in the Way, and as thou goest, there A Blessing will o'ertake thee; thou shalt meet With One to pour within thy wounds the wine And oil of consolation; He will set thee On His own steed, and bring thee to an inn Where thou may'st tarry till He comes again; Yea! all thou spendest more He will account for, For thou wert purchased and redeemed of old: Now must I leave thee, for the night wears on.” But still I held her closer, “Not before I too have blessed thee, even I, Christina; May now the blessing of a soul wellnigh To perishing be on thee! may thy love Be poured, a thousandfold by God requited, Within thy bosom.” Then Christina turned Once more beneath the lamp, and smiled farewell;— Smiled as if then the sweetness of her soul Rose to her very lips and overflowed them, But spoke not: passing swiftly through the porch, The darkness took her from me. That same night I left the guilty city far behind me; Thou knowest, Father, of my life since then. Here have I found the place Christina spoke of,— A goodly inn, where they have cared for me, These gracious souls, who loving so their Lord, And covetous for Him, upon the coin Long-lost, defaced, and soiled, could trace His image And read His superscription, half out-worn,— Soon must I leave it for a surer refuge. I sent Christina long ago a token, To tell her it was well with me, and now Fain would I send this other one, a sign From Him that loved me in the heavens, to her That loved so true on earth. When I am gone, Kind Father, to my rest, take thou this cross, Take it to her that I have told thee of— Unto Christina. 1851. GOD'S SINGER. He bore a harp within his hand, And on his breast outspread The flower, that from the dawn to dusk, For love of one o'erhead, Still follows on a look, till all Its golden leaves are shed; Ye had not called him grave or gay, For old nor yet for young Ye had not known him; so he seem'd To be them all in one; And only in his smile ye knew The Singer ere he sung. “A Name, a Name is in my heart, It bideth, hidden long, Because my hand hath not a chord That would not do it wrong; So pure is it, so sweet, unmeet For rounding of a song, Yet in the cleft, its honey left Hath made my spirit strong. “A thought, a thought is in my heart Though seldom on the string; I keep it, round all other thoughts Its sweetnesses to fling: Yea! were it not within my soul, Methinks I could not sing, Nor ever raise my voice in praise Of any other thing.” So sang he sweet, so sang he clear, and lift his look above, They said that listened, “Now he thinks of her, his ladye love;” But through the wood, where in the calm of summer's noon hung still And motionless each little leaf, there ran a sudden thrill. He stood within a Castle's keep, A Castle that could wear— Stern looming o'er its rocky steep— As dark a frown as Care. Yet now it smiled, as one beguiled Of ruggedness through sleep, So sweet a sunshine on from tower To tower did flash and leap, And all the summer's noon did swoon About it, breathing deep. On coigne and gurgoyle little heads In carven stone did seem To wink and peep, as they did creep From out some evil dream; And over each, on leaf and scroll, Strange words were writ, that seem'd to flit Within each mask, and be to it Interpreter of soul: “Sans Roi, sans Loi, sans foi:” and there, Above the gate, a time-gnawed wreath And legend mouldered half away, Spoke fair to passer underneath: “Entres dans le Chateau des delices, et fais ce que voudray.” A fountain warbled, more it seemed In weariness than play; The birds sang loud, but not as in The forest depths sing they; Yet ringing clear above them all, Up rose the minstrel's lay, As freshly shook as when the brook Sang with him on his way. The soft air lifted it on high, Through pleasant bower and hall, And ladies o'er the balcony Leant, holden in its thrall; It floated in above the din That rose within the Court,— The grey-beards paused above the cup, The gallants 'mid their sport; “Ha!” spake the Baron, “bring him in, The merry Jongleur! to the strings The wine will move, and dance within Our beakers while he sings.” As came the minstrel in the hall, He bore him high and free, Yet lowly bowed, as one long vowed To gentle courtesy. Then o'er his harp, with thought to claim A silence ere he sung, He passed his hand, as if to tame Each bounding chord that sprung Beneath it; as a loving heart, Now fretted, and now wrung, Must rise and fall unto the thrall That over it is flung; Then soft and low, as is the flow Of waters, to whose drip A child hath danced, his finger fine From string to string did slip, Till, gathered in a sudden shower, The spray-drops glanced and flew As light as when, 'mid thick-wove boughs, The sunbeams trickle through. And then, with firmer, bolder touch, he struck a deeper strain, And high amid the cloven hills, by thunder rift in twain, The swollen torrents leapt and sprang, and down the flashing rain Poured in through ghastly rents, while swift, from giant hand to hand, Like arrows torn from fiery sheaf, the lightning's jagged brand, Flung careless on from peak to peak, lit up the startled land; And then a swell, a rush as of broad rivers in their flow, Ran through it, and the forest shook with rustlings light, and low Smooth-sweeping winds, till underneath you heard the grasses grow. And as the stormy waves withdrew, Disparting here and there The flood rolled backward, and to view The mountain summits bare Pierced upwards, till a world swept out Green, jubilant, and fair; Then clear the singer's voice arose Upon the freshened air. He sang an old and simple tale, A sad and earnest song, Of things most frail that did prevail, Of weakest things made strong; Of tender Truth, that did not fail For time or change, and long Long suffered, rather than to give Content to suffer wrong; A song that hath been oft-times sung, A tale that hath been told Since first this world of ours was young, Nor with it groweth old; While human eyes keep tears to weep, And hearts have love to hold For friend or lover under sun, Or underneath the mould. The matron on her Dais high, That held her place of pride, Turned, with a trouble in her eye, Her stately head aside; For through the music little feet Went moving, and the child That One who loveth souls took back, Unaltered, unbeguiled, With sweet voice small did seem to call Upon her name, and smiled. The Gallant drew his plumèd cap Across his brow, and sighed; A hand was clasped within his own, A step was by his side; A soft low voice he seemed to meet, Each whispered tone he knew; None since had ever been so sweet, Nor any since so true, For like a child, unto the hill Whence springs the rainbow, driven, His mind on many a glittering quest Since then had toiled and striven, Yet never had he touched again The point where Earth meets Heaven. The grey-haired Seneschal, that leant Upon his staff apart, Felt somewhat trembling on his lip, And tightening round his heart,— A ruined shrine, that had not seen Its angels all depart; For now he felt his mother's kiss Upon his cheek, and heard— Oh! sound approved from lips beloved— Her fond and praiseful word. And as each aged fibre shook, And trembled to the strain, He heard the cawing of the rook,— He was a boy again! With glad feet plashing in the brook That wimpled onwards, fain Its shining boundary to trace, And clip his little world within Too small a space to leave a place For sorrow and for sin. And through each heart a pang shot strong, And on it darkly bore A sense of somewhat that had long Been lost, unmissed before; But now, to reach a guiding Hand, The Spirit groped and felt Across the void, and for the land It yearned where once it dwelt; It longed to knit some broken troth, And then, as if it knew All good below is but the show And shadow of the true, Each thirsted sore to claim once more His birthright, and renew A higher 'legiance, whence the soul Had lapsed and fallen through. And there was Silence, such as falls On one that, musing lone At midnight on a city's walls, Sees moonlight round him thrown, So heavenly fair, ere he is ware His inner sense hath grown More pure, and may not well endure To think on Pain and Sin, On all that shines so fair without That lurks so foul within Our mortal state, and ill can wait Those clearer Heights to win, Where never goodly thing goes out, Nor evil cometh in! At length the Baron broke the spell: “Sir Minstrel! sorry cheer— For all thou playest deft and well— Methinks thou bringest here; So now, that ye have made us grave, Your penance I will choose To troll us out a joyous stave, As merry Trouveurs use,— A song of jest and gaillardise To wreathe about the cup, That, while we drain it, ladies' eyes May glisten from it up.” “Fain is my harp,” the minstrel spake, “To bring you joy and ease, Yet would it break if I should take A strain on it like these: Its only skill is such to wake As may my Master please.” “Thy Master!” then the Baron smiled A scornful smile and proud, “I did not deem ye brethren free To other service vowed Than flowing of the Malvoisie And largesse clinking loud.” “Yea,” said the Minstrel, “I am free, And yet a Lord is mine— A Service that is liberty, A Master who is Thine!” Then sprang the Baron from his seat; “A priest without the frock! Now bind him, varlets, hands and feet, And fling him down the rock; For I have sworn, no hireling shorn Among their tribe should cross My threshold, but have cause to mourn His boldness to his loss.” “They bar against Thy priest the gate, Thy Singer passeth free, So hold me ever consecrate Thy Witness still to be.” Thus, looking up, the minstrel spake, And, turning, went his way From out them all, and none did seek To hinder him or stay;— And as he passed beneath the gate, A bird was singing free, And from the chapel in the wood Rose vespers solemnly; And as upon the air serene His song ascended calm, Methought it filled the space between The Carol and the Psalm! A STORY OF OLDEN TIME. [[FIRST PART.]] So spake the gentle Lady Maude: “He loves me not!—He said, ‘Nay wed me unto whom ye list, Now Margaret is dead; But, dearer than the reddest rose In bride-bower blushing brave, Is the little daisy flower that grows Upon my true love's grave. And on my lips the kiss I took So cold from hers, will cling, For marriage-bell, for priest and book, For spousal troth and ring. So if in kiss of loveless lip, In clasp of loveless hand, There lie a spell old feud to quell, And quench strife's smouldering brand; If loveless bonds can fetter hate, Be then this bridal sped: Yet in an evil fate ye mate The Living with the Dead.’” So spake the Lady Maude, and fast her tears fell down like rain: “Ten long—ten silent years my breast hath striven with this pain, And flung it off a while, then ta'en the weary load again; Ten years—ten years that I have lived the noble Guilbert's wife, Have crept uncheered by look of love, unmarked by word of strife; Within the house an honoured dame—a lady unreproved, Within the heart a slighted wife—a woman unbeloved! Long, long ago, I thought this woe would cease, or I should prove How patient grief wins quietness, how patient love wins love; Long, long ago, I thought this woe would cease, or I should be Love-lifted up to happy life, death-gathered to the free. The smile of love, the smile of death, oh! wondrous sweet they be, The brethren's and the father's kiss, and neither were for me. “The brethren's and the father's love; oh! Father, having Thine, And can we seek aught else for joy, or in our sadness pine To rest on one another's breast; oh! Father, can it be That we can need each other still?—each other—having Thee? Yet even so hast Thou been pleased to weave us in one woof, To bind us in one golden sheaf, that none may stand aloof From these sweet sacred bands, and say, ‘In having One above So have I all;’ that none may scorn his human brother's love That Thou art mindful of, and thus since Thou hast loved us, none That loves Thee best, may ever rest in loving Thee alone!” So spake she calmer: “He who made best knoweth how we feel, So dare I show Him of the thoughts that never I unseal To human ear, in very fear lest censure should lie cold With our dead fathers in their graves, heaped o'er them with the mould, Or follow on my living lord; nay, rather let this blame Be mine that dared to give him more than he hath cared to claim. And yet small blame, for who e'er lived with him that loved him not? And never sign or word of mine hath wearied him, I wot, For from the first my heart its lot accepted, understood; I saw that of the things he had he gave me what he could. No lady in the Marches sees for pleasure or for state So fair a train of servitors upon her bidding wait; I never lacked for page in bower, for minstrel in the hall, For gentle merlin on my wrist, or palfrey in the stall, Robe, gaud, and gem, each costly gift that on love's altar lies, Were mine, but never with them that which only sanctifies; And he perhaps who gave them all did never guess or know (For loving hearts run fast, and eyes unloving read them slow), That I had cast them from me fain, so might I but have found The greeting that he gave to serf, the look he gave his hound, The smile and largesse he flung down unto a vassal old,— Fain had I gathered up the one and doubled him the gold. “I am not fair as Marg'ret was; yet faces have grown bright That nature made not so, methinks, when seen by household light; And in the heart a mirror set hath shown them forth approved In every look; not only they, the lovely are the loved! For never hath my name been borne on tilt or tourney's din, Nor minstrel ta'en it for his song, a sweeter praise to win; Yet children leaving brighter dames have run in haste to press Their rosy cheeks against my own, yes, children! they could bless With unsought tenderness. Methinks a child upon my knee Had been a pleader winning love both for itself and me; A child's soft touch, perchance, had stirred the springs of feeling so, That even to my lips had risen its strong, calm overflow. Yes, even so, yet well I know these thoughts but bring unrest, They strive, but may not better that by God marked out for best— For me the best; for every path, the sun-lit and the dim, The flower-strewn as the thorny Way alike have led to Him; Yet finding Love's sweet fountain closed, it even thus befell That searching farther on I found Life's clear upspringing Well.” So spake she fervent: “I have learned by knocking at Heaven's gate The meaning of one golden word that shines above it, ‘Wait!’ For with the Master whom to serve is not to ride or run, But only to abide His Will, ‘Well waited is well done.’ So waiting, on my heart sweet words, like fragments of a song Down floated from a happy place, have whispered ‘Not for long.’ So be it; yet before I go, if I might but require One boon, if God would answer me in this my heart's desire, Then would I ask, through toil, through pain, through death itself, to see My husband's eyes, before mine close, look once with love on me. Then with this arrow that hath long through strength of pain upborne The breast that hid it, would my soul be gently, gently drawn Forth by a loving hand, that so my spirit as it passed Might breathe one slow and soft and low ‘At last, at last, at last!’” SECOND PART. All night beneath a double weight, and followed by a track Of fire that flashed along the dark, the steed, with ears laid back As if he heard a cry behind, and was aware that death Or life was laid upon his speed, bore on with deepdrawn breath And nostrils quivering wide, until at length the stars withdrawn Had melted out into the dusk that comes before the dawn. Then cheerly to his steed outspoke the rider of the twain That bore the nobler, knightlier mien, and slackened girth and rein: “Three rivers hast thou set between the foemen and our flight; Now softly, gallant Roland, now, for soon by this good light, Slow breaking pale o'er moor and dale, above the eastern hill, Soon shall I see my castle rise: art weary, or art chill, Thou gentle youth, that tremblest so? Nay, only with the cold I ween, for thou approved hast been for steadfast and for bold. Small speech has passed between us yet, small guerdon hast thou shared Of thanks as yet for all that thou for me hast done and dared; But One shall thank thee, for I wot that on my lady's 'hest (A gentle lady, true and kind!) thou camest on this quest. Yet tell me now, where foundest thou the strength, and where the skill To win at me, to set me free,—so young, so tender still?” Then answered faint and low the Page, as one that strives to speak In spite of very feebleness: “Thou seest I am weak; So took I twain for counsellors that have been held from old More strong than any under heaven, and one of them was Gold.” Long thoughtful paused the Knight, but not above the Page's word That fell perchance upon his ear (so deep he mused) unheard. Then spake he: “When at first I heard thy sweet, low-warbled song, That night by night came floating light around my dungeon strong,— Now far and faint, as if it woke and died among the stars, Now nearer, like a friend's kind voice beneath my prison bars,— I thought some spirit of the blest watched o'er me from above, And mourned for me, itself set free from all of earth but Love.” But sudden spake the Page, and clenched his hand, “To thee it seemed That Love dwells only with the Dead; yet have the living deemed That they could also love, I ween.” No further word he said, But ever fainter came his breath, and lower sank his head. “Now rest on me, thou gentle youth, for thou art sorely spent; So lean thy head upon my breast;” and ever as they went Still firmer round his drooping form Lord Guilbert did enfold His stalwart arm, and strove to wrap and shield him from the cold, And whispered oft, “How farest thou?” and still the answer fell As from a soul that moaned in sleep, “Yea, with me it is well.” So fared they on in silence, till at length, as clearer broke A glimmer on the hill's dusk edge, the boy, as one that woke, Half roused from heavy dreams, spake slow,—“This dawn to me breaks dim; I pray thee lift me off from steed ere yet my senses swim, And bear me to the little well that springs beneath the hill,— Thou knowest it?” But then the Knight spake soothingly and still,— “A little, little space, dear youth, yet bear thee up, be strong; My gentle lady waits for us.” “Nay, she hath waited long, So may she tarry yet a while. Oh, bear me to the place Where now I hear the waters flow—I ask it of thy grace!” Then kind, as one with feebleness that will contend no more, The good Knight lifted him from steed, and tenderly him bore, Light as an infant in his arms, and passive as the dead, Adown the grassy, woodland path, with firm and cautious tread; And after them a sunbeam slid, a glitter struck all through The dell, thrid deep with gossamers and films besprent with dew; On swift and silent sped the knight, yet at each step he trod He startled up the happy things beloved of Sleep and God, And through the rustling grass and leaves a hum, a twitter broke, As if the Soul within them hid half-stirred before it woke. So gliding swift 'twixt heavy boughs that stooping seemed to sign With wet, cool finger on their brows a benison divine, They gained a rocky, moss-grown stair; and where the fountain sprung, One moment as above its deep dark mirror Guilbert hung, He saw each wild-wood flower and fern that grew around the place,— And looking upward from its depths a white and deathly face! There smiled she on him in the light that never yet was cast By earthly dawn. “Thou knowest me! thou knowest me, at last!” But all his soul grew wild; from lips as pale as were her own, He murmured, “Blind as ever; blind, that only now have known— Death, death!” But with a quiet mien she spake, “Not death, but life, The winning of a long-sought boon, the ending of a strife;” And laid her head upon his breast, like one that wearied sore, Sighs deep, yet well content to know the struggle comes no more. He looked at her, he smote his hands together with a cry— “True heart and sweet, that hast not spared for one like me to die,— O live for me!” “Yea, would I fain, for what is death to prove What life bears feeble witness to—the steadfast strength of love;” So spake she tenderly: “yet One above shall choose for me, That chooseth best,—for each is blest,—to live, to die, for thee!” “Oh come unto thy place at last!” and to his heart, smit through With love and anguish, Guilbert then the dying woman drew; Two human hearts that Life had held apart with severance keen, Together met and mingled fast with only Death between. At length she raised a calm, glad face, and looking upward drew A long, deep, blissful breath—again—again—for now she knew The token,—it was Pain and Life together that withdrew. The sun brake solemn. “There,” she spake, “I see the golden gate, But not the word that shone for me so long above it—‘Wait!’ Now with this sprinkling on my soul, this Baptism, I go Where evermore from shore to shore the blissful waters flow; I see them flash in sudden light, I hear them as they roll, The billows of the flood wherewith our God makes glad the soul; There, by that river of delight, on goodly branches grow All fruits of pleasantness and peace, we failed to find below; All blossoms withered in our heat, or blighted by our frost; All things we missed and did not mourn; all things we loved and lost: There, O my husband! there this love of mine, that was not given To bless thee on the earth, will bide, stored up for thee in heaven!” SEEKING. “And where, and among what pleasant places, Have ye been, that ye come again With your laps so full of flowers, and your faces Like buds blown fresh after rain?” “We have been,” said the children speaking In their gladness, as the birds chime All together,—“we have been seeking For the Fairies of olden time; For we thought, they are only hidden— They would never surely go From this green earth all unbidden, And the children that love them so; Though they come not around us leaping, As they did when They and the World Were young, we shall find them sleeping Within some broad leaf curled; For the lily its white doors closes But only over the bee, And we looked through the summer roses, Leaf by leaf, so carefully; But we thought, rolled up we shall find them Among mosses old and dry; From gossamer threads that bind them, They will start like the butterfly, All winged: so we went forth seeking, Yet still they have kept unseen; Though we think our feet have been keeping The track where they have been, For we saw where their dance went flying O'er the pastures—snowy white Their seats and their tables lying, O'erthrown in their sudden flight. And they, too, have had their losses, For we found the goblets white And red in the old spiked mosses, That they drank from over-night; And in the pale horn of the woodbine Was some wine left, clear and bright; But we found,” said the children speaking More quickly, “so many things, That we soon forgot we were seeking— Forgot all the Fairy rings, Forgot all the stories olden That we hear round the fire at night, Of their gifts and their favours golden,— The sunshine was so bright; And the flowers—we found so many That it almost made us grieve To think there were some, sweet as any, That we were forced to leave; As we left, by the brook-side lying, The balls of drifted foam, And brought (after all our trying) These Guelder-roses home.” “Then, oh!” I heard one speaking Beside me soft and low, “I have been, like the blessed children seeking, Still seeking, to and fro; Yet not, like them, for the Fairies,— They might pass unmourned away For me, that had looked on angels— On angels that would not stay; No! not though in haste before them I spread all my heart's best cheer, And made love my banner o'er them, If it might but keep them here; They stayed but a while to rest them; Long, long before its close, From my feast, though I mourned and prest them, The radiant guests arose; And their flitting wings struck sadness And silence; never more Hath my soul won back the gladness, That was its own before. No; I mourned not for the Fairies When I had seen hopes decay, That were sweet unto my spirit So long; I said, ‘If they, That through shade and sunny weather Have twined about my heart, Should fade, we must go together, For we can never part!’ But my care was not availing, I found their sweetness gone; I saw their bright tints paling;— They died; yet I lived on. “Yet seeking, ever seeking, Like the children, I have won A guerdon all undreamt of, When first my quest begun. And my thoughts come back like wanderers, Out-wearied, to my breast; What they sought for long they found not, Yet was the Unsought best. For I sought not out for crosses, I did not seek for pain; Yet I find the heart's sore losses Were the spirit's surest gain.” THE KISS. “She died young!” “I think not so; her infelicity Seemed to have years too many.” Webster. I come to thee from one Thou knowest of,—I bear to thee her kiss: “No bitter words;” she said, “when I am gone Give thou but only this.” The mouth was wellnigh cold I took it from, yet hath it power to bless; The lips that sent it never moved of old Except in tenderness; And ere they ceased to stir They trembled, as if then they strove to frame A word,—the only one 'twixt heaven and her,— Methought it was thy name. They wore unto the last A calm, sad, twilight smile, from patience won; Her face had light on it that was not cast From joy's long-sunken sun. She waited for a word Of Love to stay on; Hope did long endure; She waited long on Time, for she had heard His spells, though slow, were sure. She waited; but her stroke Was heavier than her groaning; one by one All failed her: Grief was strongest, so it broke Each thing it leaned upon. She waited long on God, And He forsook not; through the gloomy vale She leant upon His staff, until His rod Brake forth in blossoms pale. Then did her spirit bless The gracious token; then she saw the rife Salt-crusted standing pools of bitterness Spring up to wells of life. And Peace, a friend for years Estranged, stood by her on her dying bed: See that thou weep not o'er her grave, her tears Have long ago been shed. She grieves not for the mould: A heavier load lay long upon her breast Than Earth, which hath been to her far more cold In waking than in rest! WHEN THE NIGHT AND MORNING MEET. In the dark and narrow street, Into a world of woe, Where the tread of many feet Went trampling to and fro, A child was born—speak low! When the night and morning meet. Full seventy summers back Was this; so long ago, The feet that wore the track Are lying straight and low,— Yet hath there been no lack Of passers to and fro. Within the narrow street This childhood ever played; Beyond the narrow street This manhood never strayed; This age sat still and prayed Anear the trampling feet. The tread of ceaseless feet Flowed through his life, unstirred By waters' fall, or fleet Wind music, or the bird Of morn,—these sounds are sweet, But they were still unheard. Within the narrow street I stood beside a bed— I held a dying head When the night and morning meet; And every word was sweet, Though few the words we said. And as we talked, dawn drew To day—the world was fair In fields afar, I knew; Yet spoke not to him there Of how the grasses grew, Besprent with dew-drops rare. We spoke not of the sun, Nor of this green earth fair; This soul, whose day was done, Had never claimed its share In these, and yet its rare Rich heritage had won. From the dark and narrow street Into a world of love A child was born,—speak low, Speak reverent, for we know Not how they speak above, When the night and morning meet. THE SOUL'S PARTING. She sat within Life's Banquet Hall at noon, When word was brought unto her secretly: “The Master cometh onwards quickly; soon Across the Threshold He will call for thee.” Then she rose up to meet Him at the Door, But turning, courteous, made a farewell brief To those that sat around. From Care and Grief She parted first: “Companions sworn and true Have ye been ever to me, but for Friends I knew ye not till later, and did miss Much solace through that error; let this kiss, Late known and prized, be taken for amends. Thou, too, kind, constant Patience, with thy slow, Sweet counsels aiding me, I did not know That ye were angels, until ye displayed Your wings for flight; now bless me!” but they said, “We blest thee long ago.” Then turning unto twain That stood together, tenderly and oft She kissed them on their foreheads, whispering soft: “Now must we part; yet leave me not before Ye see me enter safe within the Door; Kind bosom-comforters, that by my side The darkest hour found ever closest bide, A dark hour waits me, ere for evermore Night with its heaviness be overpast; Stay with me till I cross the Threshold o'er.” So Faith and Hope stayed by her till the last. But giving both her hands To one that stood the nearest: “Thou and I May pass together; for the holy bands God knits on earth are never loosed on high. Long have I walked with Thee; thy name arose E'en in my sleep, and sweeter than the close Of music was thy voice; for thou wert sent To lead me homewards from my banishment By devious ways, and never hath my heart Swerved from Thee, though our hands were wrung apart By spirits sworn to sever us; above Soon shall I look upon Thee as Thou art.” So she cross'd o'er with Love. RECONCILIATION. “But when in the other world, love meets love, it will not be like Joseph and his brethren, who lay upon one another's necks weeping: it will be loving and rejoicing, not loving and sorrowing.”—Baxter's Saints' Everlasting Rest. Our waking hours write bitter things Against us on Life's wall; But Sleep her small soft finger brings, And draws it through them all. Oh! sweet her kiss on tired eyes, More sweet to make amends Her child-kiss on the soul that lies, And sayeth, “Come, be friends!” One is there I have loved so long And deep, I know not when I loved her not with Love too strong To change its now to then; But Love had been with Love at war, And bitter words had been, And silence bitterer by far Had come our souls between; But now she came to me in sleep, Her eyes were on my soul: Kind eyes! they said, “And didst thou weep And I did not console? Look up, and be no longer sad!” She called me by my name: Our spirits rushed together, glad And swift as flame to flame; And all the sweetness from my life Crushed out, and all the bloom That wasted through those years of strife, And faded on their gloom, Came back together; as of old She clasped me, then I knew And spoke not, stirred not, fold by fold Our hearts together grew: Then thought I—as in whisper soft, “We two have died, and this Is joy that saints have told of oft,— The meeting and the kiss.” Such bliss, forgiving and forgiven, Ran through me while I slept, To find the ties that Earth had riven Above were sacred kept; And yet I knew it was not Heaven,— Because I wept! GONE. Alone, at midnight as he knelt, his spirit was aware Of Somewhat falling in between the silence and the prayer; A bell's dull clangour that hath sped so far, it faints and dies So soon as it hath reached the ear whereto its errand lies; And as he rose up from his knees, his spirit was aware Of Somewhat, forceful and unseen, that sought to hold him there; As of a Form that stood behind, and on his shoulders prest Both hands to stay his rising up, and Somewhat in his breast, In accents clearer far than words, spake, “Pray yet longer, pray, For one that ever prayed for thee, this night hath passed away; “A soul, that climbing hour by hour the silvershining stair That leads to God's great treasure-house, grew covetous; and there “Was stored no blessing and no boon, for thee she did not claim, (So lowly, yet importunate!) and ever with thy name “She link'd—that none in earth or heaven might hinder it or stay— One Other Name, so strong, that thine hath never missed its way. “This very night within my arms this gracious soul I bore Within the Gate, where many a prayer of hers had gone before; “And where she resteth, evermore one constant song they raise, Of ‘Holy, holy,’ so that now I know not if she prays; “But for the voice of Praise in heaven, a voice of Prayer hath gone From Earth; thy name upriseth now no more; pray on, pray on!” HAUNTED GROUND. “It is the soul that sees.” The rest have wandered on— Stay thou with me, dear friend, awhile, awhile; The air is full of voices, leading on, As o'er enchanted isle. This ground is writ all o'er With the soul's history; I may not choose— Spell-bound—but pause above this living lore To linger and to muse. We give of what we take From life of outward things; our spirits leave, Where they have been, a glory in their wake More bright than they receive. And this was once my Home: The leaves, light rustling o'er me, whisper clear— “The sun but shines on thee where thou dost roam, It smiled upon thee here.” The idea that the sun shines on us in absence, but smiles on us at home, is borrowed from a German Song. And these are of the things That God hath taken from me, safe to keep; Sometimes to let me look on them, He brings Them to me in my sleep; And I have been in sleep So oft among them, now their aspect seems The vague soft glow evanishing, to keep, Of half-remembered dreams. Thou shouldst have been with me Of old, dear friend, as now! and borne a part In all that was—then Life were filled with thee As wholly as the Heart! Then hadst thou won mine eyes My soul to look through; half it angers me To think a sweetness on the years can rise That is not mixed with Thee! Yet stoop with me to trace These olden records, overrun with bloom; The Dead are underneath, and yet the place Looks hardly like a tomb. This is the wood-walk; oft I feel a clasp detaining—not the fold Of clinging bindweed—far more close and soft, For here in days of old My earliest friend with me Walked hand in hand; we sat long hours upon This bank; and I am on the earth, but she Had wings, and she is gone. See! see! the ancient hall With sunset on it! Now the windows flame In evening light—they flash and glitter all— And one looks still the same As when my mother kept Upon me, while I played, an eye of love; Since then, it oft has watched me while I wept, Still watching, from above! As then she used to smile, And softly stroke my head; so now my heart These gentle memories stroke and soothe—awhile, Awhile we will not part. Kind shadows! from the door, At noon-day with a joyous shout flung wide, I see the merry children rush, before Its welcome stroke had died. The old domestic, grey And bowed with weight of many years, whose look And grave kind smile still followed on the way Our flying footsteps took; Such wealth was his in store Of loving words—when fain he would be stern And chide our rovings, all his speech the more To tenderness would turn! As twilight brings a face Drawn faint, yet perfect, on the darkening wall; So on me rise the spirits of each place, Yet bring not gloom withal. Heaven's wasted wealth, the gold It gave for treasure slighted and ungraced, Earth's kindly seeds of love on soil too cold Let darkly run to waste, That needed but our care To bloom for ever round the heart serene; These, these the forms of evil things that were, Of good that might have been, Time gathers silently, Yet from their ashes troubling phantoms sends More stern than these of happy hours gone by, Than these of buried friends; More sad than these that smile And whisper, “Now thou comest as a guest Where once thou dwelt—yet mourn not thou the while, Because thou hast been blest!” POETS. One spake to a Poet, “And whence hast thou won The key to the melodies vagrant that run And throb along Nature's strong pulse, like a strain That haunts us by snatches, yet doth not attain, Save in thee, to completeness: The wind-song, the bird-song, the song of the leaves, The heart-song which breathes through them all, and receives E'en in giving them sweetness?” Then he answered, “From God, who to each at His will From His fulness gives somewhat the yearning to still Of the soul, that as yet He designs not to fill; For He would not that any should tax him and say, ‘Thou gavest me nought as I went by the way To joy in and bless Thee.’” And His gifts are all blessed; He giveth to some Rich boons; they are happy, and so they are dumb,— There was Silence in Heaven; And the strength and the loving, to gaze on each thing That they have not with joy in its beauty, and sing, To some He hath given. These sit in their gladness, all robed and all crowned, As guests at Life's banquet, while swift circles around Life's rosy joy-bringer; But a banquet needs music, so these in the cold Stand singing without; though his harp be of gold, Wilt thou envy the singer? For one (was it one then?) went forth from the crowd, A warrior, chosen, and faithful, and vowed; Sore-wounded, they found him With a bright-blazoned banner wrapt round him, and prest To his bosom, to stanch its deep death-hurt; none guessed That his life-blood welled over it darkly, so proud Was the purple that bound him. Ye sit by the hearth in the cold, bright spring weather At evening, and hear the birds chiming together; And ye say, “Happy singers!” forgetting the trees Are leafless, and keen winds hold back beyond the seas The swallow, blithe comer; Yet Summer is coming for us as for these,— A long Summer. A COMPARISON. There is no Winter in the soul of Man; Its clime is Tropical, a giant tree In stately Southern forests blowing free And broad, it stands where equal Summer sways All seasons, and as one swift joy decays, Another pushes forth a fan-like frond Or succulent leaf dark-shining far beyond Before it falls; and wing-like thoughts have sown Their seeds all round about its roots, and thrown A veil of living blooms from bough to bough, Leaf, flower, and tendril twining, so that now Most vain it were to track each home, or guess Whence springs this weight and wealth of love-liness; While e'en its cloven bark, a sheath and shroud Of splendour, blossoms o'er,—so fancies crowd Within the soul, so mounting swift and high Up to that tree's tall summit, suddenly Spring in one night efflorescent, bright hopes, That drop again to earth like flowery ropes Let down from Heaven by angels' hands; yet there Stand forth, 'mid all that fulness, gaunt and bare Like matted cordage, withered coils that fruit, Or flower, or leaf, bear never, for the root From whence they drew earth's kindly juice is gone; And these are hopes that die, yet still cling on! THE ETERNAL NOW. “For one day with thee is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” “Now have I won a marvel and a Truth;” So spake the soul and trembled, “dread and ruth Together mixed, a sweet and bitter core Closed in one rind; for I did sin of yore, But this (so said I oft) was long ago; So put it from me far away, but, lo! With Thee is neither After nor Before, O Lord, and clear within the noon-light set Of one illimitable Present, yet Thou lookest on my fault as it were now. So will I mourn and humble me; yet Thou Art not as man that oft forgives a wrong Because he half forgets it, Time being strong To wear the crimson of guilt's stain away; For Thou, forgiving, dost so in the Day That shows it clearest, in the boundless Sea Of Mercy and Atonement, utterly Casting our pardoned trespasses behind, No more remembered, or to come in mind; Set wide from us as East from West away: So now this bitter turns to solace kind; And I will comfort me that once of old A deadly sorrow struck me, and its cold Runs through me still; but this was long ago. My grief is dull through age, and friends outworn, And wearied comforters have long forborne To sit and weep beside me: Lord, yet Thou Dost look upon my pang as it were now!” CONSOLATION. “They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. . . . Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there?” —Jer. viii. 11, 22. Yea! trouble springs not from the ground, yet must it ever be, Man knows that he is born to care, so seeks his remedy; And he hath found out store of charms and spells to give it rest, Yet grief turns from human comforters, the Highest is the best! One saith, “Be comforted, for grief is idle and is vain, It never hath brought back the smile to Joy's dead face again, It only fixes there the look it wore when Hope took leave; Yes, grief is vain, I know it well, and therefore will I grieve.” One saith, “Be comforted, for thus how many say with dawn, ‘Would God that it were eve!’ at eve, ‘Would God that it were morn!’” But then more noble in its woe spake out the grieving heart, “Nay! rather would I all were blest and bear alone my smart.” “And yet,” saith one, “be comforted, for grieving is a sin, Thy tears may Malachi ii. 13. stain Heaven's goodly floors yet there be trodden in; This is a grief that Heaven hath sent, a grief that thou must bear,”— And Patience smiled so cold, so cold, I took her for Despair! Yet these were simple reasoners; I said, “I will arise, I will seek out counsel from the sage and wisdom from the wise; They shall show me of their merchandise who trade for hidden things, Who go down to the heart's great deep to track its secret springs. Then with calm brow, one answered me in measured tones and brief, That we are stronger through our pain, and nobler for our grief, And when I looked on him, I saw he spoke what he believed, And I talked no more of grief to him who ne'er himself had grieved, Or he had known that spoke of Will, how vain its strong control When Deep is calling unto Deep within the wavetost soul; Yea! happy are they that endure! yet never was the tide Of nature's agony stemmed back by high, o'ermastering Pride; But then with kindlier mien, one said, “Go forth unto the fields, For there, and in the woods, are balms that nature freely yields; Let Nature take thee to her heart! she hath a bounteous breast That yearns o'er all her sorrowing sons, and She will give thee rest.” But Nature on the spirit-sick as on the spirit-free Smiled, like a fair unloving face too bright for sympathy; Sweet, ever sweet, are whispering leaves, are waters in their flow, But never on them breathed a tone to comfort human woe! Small solace for the deer that hath the arrow in its side,— And only seeks the woods to die,—that o'er his dappled hide Spread purple blooms of bedded heath, and ferny branchings tall— A deadly hurt must have strong cure, or it hath none at all; And the old warfare from within that had gone on so long, The wasting of the inner strife, the sting of outward wrong, Went with me o'er the breezy hill, went with me up the glade— I found not God among the trees, and yet I was afraid! I mused, and fire that smouldered long within my breast brake free, I said, “O God, Thy works are good, and yet they are not Thee; Still greater to the sense is that which breathes through every part, Still sweeter to the heart than all is He who made the heart! I will seek Thee, not Thine, O Lord! for (now I mind me) still Thou sendest us for soothing not to fountain, nor to hill; Yet is there comfort in the fields if we walk in them with Thee, Who saidest, “Come, ye burdened ones, ye weary, unto Me.” Yet is there comfort, not in Pride that spends its strength in vain, But in casting all our care on Thee—on Thee who wilt sustain; Not in dull Patience, saying, “This I bear, for it must be,” But in knowing that howe'er Grief comes, it comes to us from Thee! Thou, Lord! who teachest how to pray, O teach us how to grieve! For Thou hast learned the task we find so hard, yet may not leave; For Thou hast grown acquaint with Grief—Thou knowest what we feel, Thou smitest and Thou bindest up, we look to Thee to heal! PENCIL-MARKS IN A BOOK OF DEVOTION. “It happened one day, about noon, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand.” Strong words are these, “O Lord! I seek but Thee Not Thine! I ask not comfort, ask not rest; Give what, and how, and when thou wilt to me, I bless Thee—take all back—and be Thou blest.” Sweet words are these, “O Lord! it is Thy love And not thy gifts I seek; yet am as one That loveth so I prize the least above All other worth or sweetness under sun.” And all these lines are underscored, and here And there a tear hath been and left its stain, The only record, haply, of a tear Long wiped from eyes no more to weep again; And as I gaze, a solemn joy comes o'er me— By these deep footprints I can surely guess Some pilgrim by the road that lies before me Hath crossed, long time ago, the wilderness. With feet oft bruised among its sharp flints, duly He turned aside to gather simples here, And lay up cordials for his faintness—truly Now will I track his steps and be of cheer. And wearied, by this wayside fountain's brink He sat to rest, and as it then befell, The stone was rolled away, he stooped to drink The waters springing up from life's clear well. And oft upon his journey faring sadly He communed with this Teacher from on high, And meeting words of promise, meekly, gladly, Went on his way rejoicing—so will I! “FAINT, YET PURSUING.” A SONG OF THE CHURCH MILITANT. All day among the corn-fields of the plain, Reaping a mighty harvest to the Lord, Our hands have bound the sheaves; we come again,— Shout for the garners stored! All day among the vineyards of the field, Our feet have trodden out the red ripe vine: Sing! sing for hearts that have not spared to yield A yet more purple wine! All day against the spoilers of our land, Our arms made bare the keen and glittering sword; None turnèd back, none stayed the lifted hand,— Sing! sing unto the Lord! All day beset by spies, begirt with foes Building a house of holiness; by night We watched beside our weapons; slow it rose,— Sing! sing from Zion's height! ENTREAT FOR ME. TO E. F. Entreat for me, for thou hast ever stayed Within the Father's house; thine eyes serene Have followed on Him there, while I have strayed, And in far distant lands a wanderer been. Thou needest not to seek Him, and arise To go to Him, for on thy lip and brow The shadow of a blest communing lies That tells, dear friend, that thou art with Him now. “Son, thou art ever with me,” robe and ring, The greeting tear, the reconciling kiss, Were for the Prodigal's return; “each thing I have is thine,” oh, blest enough in this Art thou, that freely from the Father's store Mayst take at will of all His goods increase For thy heart's solace; mine that hungered sore Hath still to crave for pardon, still for peace. I would not dare an earthly wish to speak; Yet is there this one boon: I come to thee, Because I am not bold enough,—I seek A messenger approved,—entreat for me! So wayward children, through a dearer child, Would win some wished-for favour, pleading thus, “Go to our Father, thou art good and mild, Less often hast thou grieved him, ask for us!” A VISION OF GREEN LEAVES. The time was Winter, Winter or the Spring That comes with tardy footstep, lingering Like some reluctant Giver, yielding cold The boons that it no longer may withhold; And ere I slept, I listened to the rain Dashed by the fitful wind against the pane, The wind, that even through my sleep did seem To break upon the music of my dream, With pause of change and dreariness, and still Swelled, sighed, and moaned each varying scene to fill With trouble and unrest; at length outworn I slept within my sleep, and to the Morn (Still in my dream) awoke, with vacant eye Forth from the casement gazing listlessly, When sudden I exclaimed, “A miracle! A Summer come at once, without a Spring To herald it! a bright awakening To life and loveliness,” for all around Were leaves, green bursting leaves, and on the ground Was short grass springing thick, and through the wave The dark flag cut its swift way like a glaive; And broad as Orient growths, upon the pool, Large, juicy leaves lay mantling, smooth and cool: I saw no flowers, no fruit, but everywhere Leaves, only leaves, that filled the summer air With murmurs, soft as whispers, that the heart Hath longed and listened for; while light and low, As chidings fall from lips that turn their flow To gentleness, quick rustlings waved apart The boughs, and fragrance soothed the sense like thought Too sweet for utterance; e'en then I caught The Dream's full import: “'Tis the Spring's warm sigh,” Methought, “that calls forth all this luxury Of leaf and greenness; thus, upon the heart A word, a look will bid a Summer start, A Summer come at once, without a Spring To herald it, a sudden wakening;” Then from the bands of sleep my spirit broke, And with the sweetness on my soul I woke, And it was Winter still! but in my heart Was Summer! Summer that would not depart, But breathed across its silence, low and light, Like those sweet forest-rustlings of the night; It was a dream of Hope! and sent by Her My Lady bright, because I minister Unto her honour, while I strive to sing And praise her with my Lyre's most silver string; It was a dream of Hope; I know the hue Of her fresh mantle, and her symbol true, The leaf! she cannot give the flower or fruit, But sends their promise by a herald mute; The leaf, that comes like one in haste to bring The first of all some gladsome welcoming, And cannot speak for joy, but with the hand Still points and beckons to the coming band; I know the symbol, and I bind the sign Upon my heart to make it doubly thine, Thou Bringer of sweet dreams by day and night, Still will I sing and praise Thee, Lady bright! And I will gather of these leaves, to twine A chaplet for those sunny brows of thine; And by thy smiling Thou wilt keep its sheen, In Winter as in Summer fresh and green! TO A LONG-PARTED FRIEND. Thou comest back unto me like a ghost; And all the years that have been buried long In silence, at thy aspect, crowd and throng Each portal of my mind—a Phantom host. Now will we commune with that cloud-like train Awhile, then send them to their rest again; For all their forms are pale and colourless; Not from their full Joy-vintage could we press The wealth of this day's gleanings! nay, the woes That we have known since then have nobler shows, And all their “more” sounds feebler than our “less.” We parted in the blossom and the bud, Now in the bloom-time of Life's perfect Rose We meet; and though it may not yet unclose Each petal, for that earth lies ever cold About its roots, and in their conflict rude, Rough, biting winds have bowed its head, and strewed Some leaves upon the ground; yet hath it won From shower and shining, from the moulds and sun Deep colours, odours richer than of old! The rocks that lock the Vale's monotony In quiet, once our mutual vision spanned; Since then by distant pathways, painfully We have been climbing both, now hand-in-hand Together on the steep ascent we stand, And see the spot where then we parted lie Beneath us like a speck; now through the haze, Disparting for a moment, we will gaze Down on the Alpine hamlet, till we hear Its songs and sheepfold tinklings rising clear, Then lift an upward heaven-aspiring eye Together, ere our tracks break suddenly, And we go onwards through the cloud and mist Alone, yet cheerful! on the Hill, dear Friend, Ere evening-light its cold white brow hath kissed, Tingeing its snows with rose and amethyst, Once more those far-diverging lines may blend! “SO IT HAPPENS.” FROM THE GERMAN OF EMANUEL GEIBEL. “He loves thee not,” so spake they to her cold; “He trifles with thee;” then she bowed her head, And down her cheeks, like dew from roses, rolled The tears fast welling at each word they said; Oh! why did she believe? for when he came Her doubtings angered him; a seeming light He held through all, he spoke and smiled the same, And waited—waited to weep through the night! Still knocked a better angel at her heart, “Yet is he true, give, give thy hand again;” Still felt he through that bitterness and smart, “She loves thee yet, she loves thee now as then; Speak but one word, hear but one greeting kind, So is the spell that lies betwixt you broken.” Once more they met; oh, Pride is harsh and blind, That word, that only word remained unspoken. So parted they, and as within the choir Of some great Minster, wanes the altar-light To duller red; then flashes fitful fire All quivering restless, then sinks down in night; So love died in them, long and sore bewept— Called back again with yearnings vain, at last Forgotten—till within each heart it slept, With old illusions faded and o'erpast. Yet oft-times started they, when moonlight streamed, Up from their pillows that were wet with tears, And wet with tears each face, for they had dreamed I know not what; then thought they of the years, The old, the lovely time that once had been, And of their idle doubts, their broken troth, And all that now was set their souls between, So wide, so wide—O God, forgive them both! THE PICTURE AND THE SCROLL. “Oh, mes amis! lisez-vous quelquefois mes vers; mon âme y est empreinte.” A Bride looked long upon her picture: “Thou Art left among the things I held most dear, A dearer love is calling me; yet now These to my heart have never been so near; And I shall not be by when they are gay; They will be sad, and I shall be away; Yet Thou wilt look upon them night and day, As once I looked, so now I leave upon Thy silent lips a kiss to bide alway,— Smile on them, smile on them when I am gone!” A Singer looked in silence on a scroll, Her eyes were dark with eloquent fire, her soul Smiled through them bride-like—yet the hand was cold That locked her slender palm within its hold, And set the spousal wreath upon her brow; She said, “I go from all that has been dear, For dearer love is calling me; yet now These to my heart have never been so near, So will I leave my kiss this scroll upon, That they may find it, while I whisper clear, ‘Smile on them, smile on them when I am gone!’” TO A YOUNG GIRL. Twelve years before thee through life I must run, Dearest! oh, would I might counsel the hours, Saying, “Keep back your best sunshine for one That is coming behind me, and spare her the showers!” Fain would I stop to remove from thy way Stones that have bruised me, and thorns that have grieved; Set up my errors for waymarks, to say— Here I was wounded, ensnared, or deceived! Vain is my wishing! in lines of our own We must traverse the pathway marked out from above; Life is a sorrowful teacher, alone We must learn its deep lessons—unaided by Love. Yet where I journey waste places among, I will scatter a seed by the wayside, and say, Soft to myself as I hasten along— “It may be a flower when she cometh this way;” Yet will I leave thee some token, that there, Just where the path looks most rugged and dim, It haply may cheer thee in meeting with Care, To know that thy friend walked before thee with Him! So for thy loving and trusting and truth, Gentle acquittance in part it may be; Thou who hast shrined me an image of Youth, Brighter than ever my youth was to me! February 13th. A SONG OF MEMORY. Here it was I saw her last: When the farewells all were said, Through the garden speeding fast She o'ertook me breathless, led By some gentle after-thought, That she spoke not yet, but smiled As I stooped to set me free From a wild-briar clinging, “See, This kind weed to stay thee sought, Yet wilt thou break from it and me;” Then she clasped me, smiling still Through the shining of a tear, “Come and go, dear friend, at will, Comfort still thou leavest here; Should the future days bereave, Never with a chiding sore Can the bygone bid us grieve That we loved not in them more!” So we parted where we stood In the ancient gateway; then As I hurried down the wood, Once I turned to look again Where she stood, in life and bloom, With the summer sunshine kind Streaming round her, in the gloom Of the massive arch enshrined; To her feet the shadows crept From the grey and ruined stone, And her form from out them swept Like an Apparition thrown On the sunny air—the light Smote her forehead—even now Bides that vision in my sight With the halo on its brow! Even so, within my heart Ever young and fond and fair Stands she in her shrine, apart From the ruins round her there; Glides her image through its gloom In a quiet track of light, As within a darkened room Soft a straggling sunbeam falls On the ceiling, on the walls, Finding nothing else so bright! Dark the castle stands above, Dark the river onward floweth, Murmuring as one that knoweth Somewhat of my grief and love. Nay! the river nothing knoweth, Ever floweth, ever speedeth, Nothing heedeth as it floweth, Of all my heart hath missed and needeth; Murmur, murmur, still unknowing, Murmur, murmur, in thy flowing, None the less will fond believing Link thy chiding with my grieving. Since we walked beside thy stream, Oft 'mid summer musings lost I have dreamed a deeper dream; She a deeper stream hath crossed,— Crossed it singing! once of old Dark and swift that river flowed Sunless, to an unknown sea; And the nations shivering stood On the margin of the flood, Sorely pressed behind,—before Lay a dim and doubtful shore; Till a Helper, at the cry Of a world in agony, With a garment dipped in blood, Smote the waters as He passed On a glorious errand;—fast Hither, thither backwards drew All the sullen waves, and through Came His ransomed! King and Priest, Sage and warrior, virgin mild, And the Slave from bonds released, And the mother with her child, From the greatest to the least, Crossed it singing! but to me As I watched that company, Strong and beautiful and bold Seemed they all, and I was weak, And the river still was cold, And the country far to seek! But since Thou didst leave my side, Following after, with my tear Still upon thy cheek undried, Seems the river far less wide, And the hither shore more near: Ever more that shore was dear For the sake of one unseen, So He shows me it more clear By the light of what had been, For like lichen on the stone Ever round each well-known thing Still this heart of mine hath grown, Firm to fix and close to cling: So God beckons by a Hand I have clasped, unto His land; So He bids its Dawn arise On me, through beloved eyes; So the new, unearthly song Seems a strain remembered long; With the angel voices blend Tones familiar, seraphs wear Looks I loved on earth; oh, friend, Kind companion, Thou art there! TO JOSEPHINE. AN APOLOGY. I thought of Shakspere saying long ago, That forms were but devised to set a gloss On hollow welcomes, making up the loss Of kindness, with their faint, unreal show, When Thou to give me greeting didst upraise Thy gracious head, bowed ever lowly down As if thou didst incline to meet thy crown Of Blessing, and of Favour and of Praise; Then looking for the first time in thine eyes, My soul rushed up to thine, and did disclaim All set approaches, swift to recognise Its kindred—and I called thee by thy name! THE MARRIAGE OF TRUE MINDS. The annals of the heart are rich and various, extending over a wide region, yet it would be hard, among all its written or traditionary wealth, to find a sweeter true-love story than that contained in the lyrical autobiography of Vieira, the Lusitanian, the famous painter and faithful husband. This poem, which was given to the world at the age of eighty-one, three years before the author's death, is so remarkable in all respects, as to have been considered by Southey the best book Portugal has to boast of. It is full of extraordinary incident, and celebrates the passion which, beginning before either of the lovers was eight years old, forms, in its mutual strength and constancy, at once the marvel and the glory of the two lives it bound together.— See on this subject an article in Blackwood's Magazine for March 1851, “The Fine Arts in Portugal.” “Endure and dare, true heart, through Patience joined With boldness come we at a Crown enriched With thousand blessings.” —From the Spanish of Argensolas. I. AGNES AT HER WINDOW. My window looks upon a dead blank wall, Yet flowers that grow beyond are kind, and send— As friend might soothingly to prisoned friend— Their kisses blown upon the wind, to call A summer round me in my cell, where all Breathes of the rose and jessamine that blend; And struggling o'er—yet more to make amend, A Vine hath run, and on my side let fall Some leaves and tendrils, chequering the dull stone With verdurous gloom; e'en like such gracious bough Hast thou, O Love! thy goodly branches thrown O'er our Life's drearness; grieved and hated Thou By this world's archers, yet Thou dost abide In strength, firm rooted on the other side! II. THE SERENADE. Last night, as Thou thy wonted round didst make, Beloved watcher, sore I chid the wind, When citron scents were wooing it, to take Thy sweetness from me, leaving theirs behind! For ever, though my very soul did wake To catch that broken music, tenderness Was fain to fill its pauses with a guess! And “Oh, my prisoned jewel” “Tesouro imprisonado.” (so I strove To bind these links, the breezes' envious dole In one), thou calledst me “thy star, thy dove, Thy rose, thy angel, treasure of thy soul!” These words came fitfully, the strain passed by; Then from these scattered fragments Love and I Sat down to frame one bright mosaic whole! Thou callest me thy Rose! O that indeed I were A white rose—dewy fair, Or ruby-red—that glows On India's fervid air; For then would I enclose My fragrance shut within thy heart, and dwell As lives the flower's quick spirit in the cell It floods with sweetness, sweetness never knowing Loss for the bounty of its overflowing! Thou callest me thy Pearl! O that indeed I were A bright pearl gleaming fair, A white pearl in its quivering lustre, yet Faint-shining like a tear,—a tear that met With comfort ere it fell, and trembling hung Awhile, all round and glistening, where it sprung; Then would I fall and lie, Beloved, in thy cup dissolving slow At Life's great banquet, and thou shouldst not know What gave thy wine the tinge of ecstasy! O that indeed I were A star, a jewel rare, A soft snow-plumaged dove, An Angel from above; Thou sayest, “These are mine,” And hast but one poor heart; yet love, Love on, and all are thine! III. AGNES AMONG THE SISTERS. I sit among the sisters—moments make Their way to hours, as slowly day by day Creeps lagging on, as if before them lay Some evil Thing they feared to overtake; Our fingers move together swift, but slow And few the words that fall, like drops that ooze From springs that in the desert long ago The drifting sands sucked in; full oft I choose To hearken if some echo subterrain Tells where life's hidden streams in darkness yet Flow on; but all is silent, and again I look and see each face before me set— A dial-plate with mosses long o'ergrown, And finger that still duly round the stone Moves on to point to nothing; then I thank My own, if it from theirs hath caught this blank Impenetrable aspect, and so lies A scroll outspread, yet locking from their eyes (Though writ within, without) the precious lore They would but shrink from; yet my heart runs o'er With pity and with love, for these were made For noble creatures, that within the shade Kept by man's fraud, and cheated of their right In the Great Father's heritage of light And warmth, have shrunk to mildewed forms like these; So will they die, methinks, and never know What life was made of, till they pass above To sun themselves for ever in the Love Whose blessed reflex they have missed below. And in the stillness oft my fancies please To frame similitudes, as like a pall This silence wraps our spirits, one and all; Yet theirs, methinks, is Polar silence froze Unto the centre; snows piled up on snows 'Mid icy seas where glimmer to the moon Cold shapeless forms, and wrecks that to and fro Drift aimless on; but like a Torrid noon Is mine, begirt with stillness like to death, Where large-leaved flowers upon the burning air Hang motionless, and drink its fiery breath; And every beast lies couched within its lair, And bird with folded wing; yet listen! there A pulse beats audibly, a murmur rife Above, beneath, this sultry hush profound Is quickening on the sense, and at a sound Will flash and kindle, all instinct with Life! IV. And oft upon me is the fancy borne And oft upon me is the fancy borne— (Wild wish whose wayward longing doth but prove How this poor heart with anxious throbbings worn Hath need of rest from all things, e'en from love!) To cross those icy barriers that wreathe Betwixt these sisters' souls and mine; to see How it fares with them on the heights, and breathe The cold, clear air of their serenity; For thought o'er-peoples all this life of mine, So would I leave it for one moment, free From hope, fear, rapture—yea, Beloved, from thee. One moment! could I thus indeed resign A fraction of my troubled wealth, my bliss So dearly won? I trow not! and in this I seem like some proud courtier bowed and bent With weight of honours, that beside his road Sees nested 'mid thick leaves some low abode; “There,” sighs he, “there is peace and calm content,” Yet would he deem its quiet—banishment! WITHOUT AND WITHIN. Once spake a grey-haired poet: A noble thing and good To strike a heat adown the chain of our great brotherhood; To send the blazing torch of truth from eager hand to hand, To bid thought's swift electric wire vibrate from land to land. To nurse a generous seed that in the mind hath taken root, Then waft it forth on kindlier soil to come to nobler fruit, By fire-lit hearth, in love-lit heart, a heritage to claim; This have men called an idle breath, the vanity of Fame! But as to champing steed the noise of battle from afar, That bids him paw the ground, and neigh to trumpet-sound, Ha, ha! Is Fame to poet-soul, and mine hath shared among the rest; Yet was the praise of earliest days the sweetest and the best! And it is with me now as when with keen, ambitious breast, At school I struggled with my mates, and ever foremost pressed; Yet knew not what I won—the worth or sweetness of my prize— Till I took it home, and read them both within my mother's eyes! My mother! She to whom I read my earliest rude essays, Who pinned my verses in her gown, and on her household ways, As she kept moving, to herself she said them ever soft; I had a True-love afterwards that read them not so oft! And He, the kind old bachelor whose heart had been for one Too much, and so he shared it out with all beneath the sun— I see his broad and honest brow, the sparkle in his eye (A steadfast fire undimmed by age), I hear his slow reply. The patientest of anglers he, and I the quietest Of dreamy boys, true comrades we,—he chose me from the rest; Content to saunter by his side in silence through the day, Through coppice and by stream, the while my thoughts were far away, Perhaps with Crusoe in his isle; our noonday meal we took Beneath an old grey lichened rock that beetled o'er the brook; Then were our tongues set free at last! not learning much nor wit Went with our simple fare, but talk as well that seasoned it. I never hear a chafing brook, nor see the smooth stones lie Beneath it golden-brown, or mark the mailéd dragonfly Shoot past, but something o'er my soul a summer feeling sends, That brings my good old kinsman back, and all my boyhood's friends. One still is left—the friend that fought my battles out at school; Now would he fight them with the world, if ever it should cool To verse of mine—yes, inch by inch contending: not a line He reads, but takes them all on trust,—content that they are mine. Now have I made me store of friends, the kindred of my mind; They give unto me of their wealth, I pay them back in kind: The world needs music at its feasts, it bids me welcome free; It loves me for the songs I sing, but these loved my songs for me! And so to such as these my heart flies back, a thing set free; It craveth more than doth the mind, less cold equality; Love is the one true leveller below—he bringeth down, He raiseth up, he sets on all his chosen brows a crown: For He hath gold enough, enough of sweetness in his tone To lend an echo unto Fame far deeper than its own; Its hollow cymbal-sound is gone, and hushed its selfish din, When praising from Without is met by loving from Within. MADANA. The invisible Madana (or Kama), the Hindu Cupid, is armed with a bow of Sugar-cane, strung with bees, and five arrows, each tipped with a flower exercising a peculiar and distinct influence on the heart; among these, one alone of fatal and unerring flight is headed, and the head covered with honeycomb. Summer! Summer! soft around, With a hushed and dream-like sound, From a beating heart that knows Too much rapture for repose, Breathless, tremulous, arise Murmurs; thick mysterious sighs: Whispers, faintly wandering by, Breathe a warning out and die; Lightly o'er the bending grass, Changeful gleams and shadows pass; Through the leaves a conscious thrill Lightly runs, and all is still; Like the tree The red Asoka, supposed to blossom when its stem comes in contact with the foot of a beautiful woman. whose branch and stem Flame with many a sudden gem, Blushing in its haste to greet Touch of Beauty's slender feet; Earth with inner joy opprest, Shaken from her central rest, Through her bursting bloom reveals Hidden ecstasy she feels: Now the rich, unfolding Rose Through its crimson splendour glows; Jasmine blossoms manifold Shed their stars of paly gold; On the lake's broad bosom borne, Redd'ning to the redd'ning dawn, Flashes many a floating cup Raised to drink the sunbeams up; Drooping on the heavy air Faint with sweetness that they bear, Now the Mango buds grow pale O'er their passion-breathing tale; And the Champak's leaves disclose Where, amid their vestal snows, Kindling at deep gleaming eyes Fiery-hearted fragrance lies; Summer! Summer! now the air Trembles—Madana is there! Watch not for his flitting wing, List not for the bounding string, Floating 'mid the groves to choose Gorgeous blossoms, mingled hues, Viewless as the viewless wind, Weaving spells for heart and mind, Flower-armed, flower-crowned Deity, Light his unseen arrows fly! Tremble not! the archer's smile Plays but carelessly the while Summer lightning o'er the sky Flashing, flick'ring restlessly; Sporting with the passing hours, He hath winged their flight with flowers; Gentle witchery and brief, He hath breathed o'er bud and leaf; That hath lent to glance and tone Light and sweetness not their own; And as these shall fade away, Will the pleasant charm decay, Droop, and leave no trace behind Where its clasping tendrils twined, Fading, fleeting, like the sigh Of some wandering melody; Like a blissful dream that flings Light upon the coming day, Like a bird whose gorgeous wings Glitter as it flits away; So they vanish! yet the heart Ere its gentle guests depart Links a thought for after hours,— Summer! to thy songs and flowers! Yet beware the hidden power, Madana hath yet his hour: These were but the chords that thrill Lightly to a master's will,— Tones, his wand'ring fingers fling Breeze-like from the trembling string, Ere he call forth all the fire, All the passion of the Lyre; Ere he stir through one deep strain All the founts of joy and pain, One full chord is yet unshaken, One wild note hath yet to waken, One keen arrow yet to fly— Tremble! Madana is nigh! O'er the fatal shaft is thrown Sweetness all the archer's own; For his strength in sweetness lies— Sweetness, that through gentle eyes (E'en in gazing half withdrawn) Sheds upon the soul a dawn; Sweetness ling'ring in a word, Softly uttered, faintly heard, Yet within the heart to dwell, Treasured deep in many a cell, Long with haunting echoes rife, When the sounds have died to life; From that subtle arrow's might, Vain is wisdom, vain is flight! Vain the charmer's boasted spell Mightier charms than his to quell; Groves of sandal and of balm Yield no soothing, yield no calm, Though their odorous branches shed Fragrant tears upon thy head, Vainly o'er thine aching brow Droops the incense-breathing bough, Not the cooling The flower and leaf of the lotus are used by Ilindu writers as the type of all grace and beauty, and they suppose the latter to possess a peculiar efficacy in allaying any mental disquietude. Lotus leaf Gives to hurt like thine relief; To thy throbbing temples prest, Bound upon thy burning breast; Vainly! still through pulse and vein Glows the dull unceasing pain; Vainly, vainly! still the smart Rankles in thy stricken heart. Therefore from the earth a sound, Hushed, and dream-like, and profound, Gathers—warning whispers rise, Murmurs, thick, mysterious sighs! Therefore all the haunted air Trembles—Madana is there! VALENTINES AND SONGS. “For Lovers' eyes more sharply-sighted be Than other men's, and in dear Love's delight See more than any other eyes can see. But they who love indeed, look otherwise With pure regard and spotless true intent, Drawing out of the object of their eyes A more refinèd form which they present Unto their mind void of all blemishment: Which seeing now so inly fair to be As outward it appeareth to the eye, And with the spirit's proportion to agree, Love thereon fixeth all his fantasie, And fully setteth his felicitie, Counting it fairer than it is indeed, And yet indeed its fairness doth exceed! Spenser's Hymn in honour of Beauty. LUISA. “Just like Love is yonder Rose, Heavenly sweetness round it throws, And in the midst of briars it blows, Just like Love!” Camoens. I stood at eve upon the furrowed shore With One, that as the tide its legions filed Unto our feet, stooped down, and o'er and o'er Wrote on the sand that only name, and smiled— The stern, self-mocking smile joy owns no more— To see the waves efface it. “Far more slow,” He said, “are Time's dull waters in their flow To wear away that name where it is writ And graven deep, as with a pointed gem, Upon the rock; yet vain to cancel it All else, so must I leave it unto them! This name, that I in weakness of self-scorn, With idle finger have dishonoured thus, Fair-written once in letters luminous, Was shut and clasped within my heart's great Book— For ever, as I deemed! rude hands have torn Those pages from my life, but Memory Hath kept them; yet for sadness scarce can brook Within that rifled volume now to look, Or shut its golden clasps without a sigh! THE SUMMER FRIEND. TO C. M. “It was not in the winter Our loving lot was cast; It was the time of roses,— We plucked them as we pass'd.” Hood. Yes! ever with the Summer, As flies across the sea The Spring's first blithesome comer, My thoughts fly swift to thee! For they were wove of sunbeams, The ties that hold us fast; It was Summer when I saw thee first, And when I saw thee last! And short and bright as Summer Our meetings still have been, (Enough, enough of Winter Hath ever come between!) Till with a doubling sweetness Thy smile is now a part Of Summer,—Summer on the earth, And Summer in the heart! Still come, dear friend, in Summer, That I may keep thee twined With all its warm and golden gifts, For ever to my mind! Yet come, dear friend, in Winter, To prove what half my heart Hath guessed, that it is Summer still,— My Summer where thou art! February 13, 1851. “QUI SAIT AIMER, SAIT MOURIR.” “I burn my soul away!” So spake the Rose and smiled; “within my cup All day the sunbeams fall in flame,—all day They drink my sweetness up!” “I sigh my soul away!” The Lily said; “all night the moonbeams pale Steal round and round me, whispering in their play An all too tender tale!” “I give my soul away!” The Violet said; “the West wind wanders on, The North wind comes; I know not what they say, And yet my soul is gone!” Oh, Poet, burn away Thy fervent soul! fond Lover at the feet Of her thou lovest, sigh! dear Christian, pray,— And let the World be sweet! THE BROKEN CHAIN. Captives, bound in iron bands, Half have learned to love their chain; Slaves have held up ransomed hands, Praying to be slaves again: So doth custom reconcile, Soothing even pain to smile; So a sadness will remain In the breaking of the chain. But if chain were wove of flower, Linked and looped to sister free, With a Name and with an Hour, Running down its Rosary; Light as gossamers on green, By their shining only seen;— Would not something sad remain In the breaking of the chain? But if chain were woven shining, Firm as gold and fine as hair, Twisting round the heart and twining, Binding all that centres there In a knot, that like the olden May be cut, yet ne'er unfolden;— Would not something sharp remain In the breaking of the chain? A VALENTINE. I said to One I loved, “Why art thou sad?” And he made answer, “There hath been a tune Long floating round my brain; morn, night, and noon, With inarticulate cadence making glad, Yet vexing me, because I could not find Words sweet enough to set to it, and bind Its music round about my heart for aye. Till, musing late above an ancient book, The window being open, breezes fleet Lifted the rare old page, and sudden shook A loose leaf, writ with song, unto my feet: In these quaint words methought lies hid the key To all those cadences faint struggling round, Now will I wed them to that melody, And set my Life to music by their sound; E'en so I practised them upon my lute Early and late, yet found they would not suit Together, though so sweet! and all the strain Broke into discords! still the strain goes on, But only angers me, its meaning gone; Nor will I ever seek to find it words again! February 13. A VALENTINE. TO C. M. One said to me, “To-day I go where I perchance may meet thy Friend,— What shall I take from thee?” I answered, “Nay, Nought have I left to send, “For she hath all of mine Already! only giving of her store— A little miser!—through her usury fine To draw on mine the more! “More fit that she send back What she hath won of me; but it were vain,— What once hath been with Her will seek the track, The wonted track, again!” February 13. “ICH DIEN.” She spake to him—that woman with a brow Most like a Queen's,—“With all the sovereignty That I was born to, crown and sceptre, My soul hath parted—Be thou true to me; Fain had I brought thee all; but vassal's vow And bended knee were but for One; e'en so, All state I may not share, I would forego!” “Once dwelt I in a Palace of Delight, A lonely castle on enchanted seas; Its hundred doors stood open day and night; My thoughts gold-banded—honey-laden bees— Passed to and fro for traffic; now all these That I have slighted (like true friends of yore Left for a stranger's smile), return no more. “And I may not return to them, or stand Among them as in olden days, when well They stored my treasure-caverns, for my hand Hath lost its wonted gesture; and the spell— Through murmuring one name this chance befell— That gave those treasure-chambers to the clay, Hath passed, forgotten, from my mind away! “So let it pass!—it were a thought too bold Within my grasp to keep these empires twain, And living in two Worlds, the New and Old, To serve in one, and in the other reign! Would now that all mine ancient fair domain, To spirits calm and free I might resign, To take their joy in it, as I in thine!” Her words were high, yet like proud music shook From straining chords, that in their vibrant fall Break over it, her faltering accents took Them all in humbleness; she did recall No gift for vaunting that had given all For All or Nothing? pleading mournfully, “I love, I serve,—oh, be thou true to me!” THE BABES IN THE WOOD. A LOVER'S DREAM. So dreaming sad and true, He deemed he saw two outcast children rove; Oft had he nursed them fondly, so he knew Their faces—Hope and Love! And ever farther North— Such heavy doom lay on them through some sin And sorrow not their own—they wandered forth, And none did take them in. The wild wind round them strewed Brown whirling leaves, and sighed amid its play, While ever deeper in the wintry wood Their small feet went astray. Yet smiling as they sung Their little songs, they held each other's hand, And cheered each other onwards in a tongue None else might understand. They fed each other kind— For slender food these gentle Babes require— With here and there a berry, left behind On ragged thorn or brier. And closer, as the dew Fell dank, unto each other's side they crept; And closer, closer to each other drew For warmth, before they slept; For by some law, these two Together born, together linked for aye, Could only die together! so they knew What time their hour drew nigh. And oft amid the chill They woke, and listened for each other's breath, And felt a pulse beat feebly; all was still, And yet it was not Death! “Still, Brother, thou art warm,” They whispered to each other; till its fold Relaxing languidly, each little arm Grew stiff, and both were cold. No pious Robins there Brought leaves; but smitten with a late remorse, A pitying Spirit of the upper air Wept kind above each corse; And from undying bowers Shook on those Children, buried in the snow, Sweet buds and blossoms of the very flowers They played with long ago! SONNETS. ASCENDING. They who from mountain peaks have gazed upon The wide illimitable heavens, have said, That still receding as they climbed, outspread, The blue vault deepens over them, and one By one drawn further back, each starry sun Shoots down a feebler splendour overhead So, Saviour! as our mounting spirits, led Along Faith's living way to Thee, have won A nearer access, up the difficult track Still pressing, on that rarer atmosphere, When low beneath us flits the cloudy rack, We see Thee drawn within a widening sphere Of glory, from us further, further back,— Yet is it then because we are more near. LIFE TAPESTRY. Too long have I, methought, with tearful eye Pored o'er this tangled work of mine, and mused Above each stitch awry, and thread confused; Now will I think on what in years gone by I heard of them that weave rare tapestry At Royal looms, and how they constant use To work on the rough side, and still peruse The pictured pattern set above them high; So will I set my copy high above, And gaze and gaze till on my spirit grows Its gracious impress; till some line of love Transferred upon my canvas, faintly glows; Nor look too much on warp or woof, provide He whom I work for sees their fairer side! LOVE BIRDS. IN A POLYTECHNIC EXHIBITION. “For likely hearts composed of stars concent Are these—whom Heaven did at the first ordain And made out of one mould the more t' agree; Love have they harboured since their first descent Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see And know each other here beloved to be.” Spenser. Mine eyes, 'mid all these wonders may not choose But fix on ye, meek pair, so closely prest For warmth against each other, breast to breast, Till all their green and golden couplets fuse, And run in one the many-mingling hues, Whereon your heads lie, drooped and sunk in rest, With eyes half closed, yet straying never, lest Their gaze its one accustomed object lose. Now do ye mind me of two spirits, cast On life, 'mid all its strangeness new and old, That having found each other out at last, No longer rove, but mutually enfold Soft plume with plume that blends and mingles fast, The while they keep each other from the cold! TO ELIZABETH BARRET BROWNING. I lose myself within thy mind—from room To goodly room thou leadest me, and still Dost show me of thy glory more, until My soul like Sheba's Queen faints, overcome, And all my spirit dies within me, numb, Sucked in by thine, a larger star, at will; And hasting like thy bee, my hive to fill, I “swoon for very joy” amid thy bloom; Till—not like that poor bird (as poets feign) That tried against the Lutanist's her skill, Crowding her thick precipitate notes, until Her weak heart brake above the contest vain— Did not thy strength a nobler thought instil, I feel as if I ne'er could sing again! TO A REMEMBERED STREAM, AND A NEVER FORGOTTEN FRIEND. Sweet stream, the haunt of solitary hern And shy king-fisher, far from busy town Or even populous hamlet, winding down Through banks thick fringed with underwood and fern And hazel thickets, where the ripe nuts turn Unmarked and slow to Autumn's ruddy brown; Where gems thy single rock its feathery crown (For nought of thine looks ever sad or stern!) With berried scarlet of the mountain-ash;— I never hear 'mid waking dreams thy dash Above the pebbles, but I think on One Whose course of days hath by thy waters run, A course like thine of calm and quietness, Nor ever raised a voice except to bless. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. TO D. E. L. Too full our hearts of sorrowful delight, Of parting converse, that one night, I ween, For dream of Midsummer or Fairies' Queen; As Thou sat'st near me, half in shade, half light, The moonbeams touched thy forehead cold and white, And Thou didst speak in moonlight! so serene And soothing were thy words, and all thy mien, Transparent as thy soul! when swift and bright (So did our talk the short-lived night beguile) The sun broke in to bid us make an end With his beginning! Since that hour, dear friend, I never think on Thee, so calm the while Yet cheerful, but the sweetness seems to blend Of moonlight and of sunlight in thy smile! RESERVE. Now would I learn thee like some noble task That payeth well for labour; I would find Thy soul's true Dominant, and thus unwind Its deeper, rarer harmonies, that ask Interpreting; for like a gracious mask Is thy calm, quiet bearing; far behind Thy spirit sits and smiles in sunshine kind, And fain within that fulness mine would bask: Set if thou wilt this bar betwixt thy tide Of feeling and the world that might misknow Its strength; use ever with the crowd this pride, “Thus far, and yet no farther shall ye go;” But not with me, dear friend, whose heart stands wide To drink in all thy Being's overflow. DREAMS. “Dost thou believe in dreams?” I asked my Friend; But then he answered quickly, “Would that I Could learn that gentle Faith! to certainty Turn all that Hope dares faintly apprehend! Then would Life's richest colours meet and blend Together, fused as in a Tropic sky That hath no clouds; then Life would utterly For all its wrongful doings make amend; For Life hath brought me partings, but in Rest Are only meetings! for the waking hours Have trampled in their flight upon my flowers; But Sleep's kind hand still gathers them again From bowers remote, and binds them on my breast,— I dare not stir for fear to break their chain!” February 13. THE SOUL'S WOOERS. Like Captive Judah, underneath the Tree She sat alone and silent on the ground; While from the valley rising, came the sound Of music and of dancing, gay and free,— But none did bid her to that company; Till lifting up her heavy lids, she found One standing by her, winged, and rosy crowned And robed within the purple: “Rise, for thee (He said, and kissed her on the brow elate) The Ruler of the Feast hath kept till now The richest wine;” but as she marvelled, drew Another near, that whispered to her, “Wait; Not of this vintage shalt thou taste till thou Shalt drink it with me in my Kingdom new.” HOPE. When I do think on thee, sweet Hope, and how Thou followest on our steps, a coaxing child Oft chidden hence, yet quickly reconciled, Still turning on us a glad, beaming brow, And red, ripe lips for kisses: even now Thou mindest me of Him, the Ruler mild, Who led God's chosen people though the wild, And bore with wayward murmurers, meek as thou That bringest waters from the Rock, with bread Of angels strewing Earth for us! like Him Thy force abates not, nor thine eye grows dim; But still with milk and honey-droppings fed, Thou leadest to the Promised Country fair, Though thou like Moses may'st not enter there! TO A FRIEND. Oh, call me but thy Friend! Seek thou no other word when thou wouldst pour Thy soul in mine; for this unto the core Of Love doth pierce, and in it comprehend All secrets of its lore! Yet thou dost move within A Tropic sphere of soul, and all too weak For thy full-hearted utterance; worn too thin By daily usage seem the words we speak, Too oft misprizing them; so thou dost hold This current coin of ours for base, and choose From thine own wealth new moulds, wherein to fuse Thy virgin, unsunned gold! So let thy choice be free! Our spirits thus by divers laws are bound; One may not judge the other, but from me Seek thou no other token! for its sound Hath been to me for music; bringing round Kind eyes that looked on me, kind hands I found Outstretched to help me over pathways drear; And some of these are far, and some are near, And some are in the Heavens, but all are dear In God, who gave them to me; so this “Friend” Is like a full-stringed chord, that still doth seem Within its sound to gather up and blend All, all that life in other lives that takes Away Life's curse of barrenness, and makes Our Being's sweet and often-troubled dream! I never used it lightly; unto me A sacredness hung round it; for a Sign I held it of our common words that be Initial letters of a speech divine: Oh, take this coin, too oft to worthless ends Profaned, and see upon its circlet shine One Image fair—one Legend never dim; And Whose but Cæsar's? for this word by Him Was used at parting, “I have called you Friends.” TO L. M. “La mia Sorella che tra buona e bella Non so qual più fosse.” Soft eyes, soft hands, soft step that with no sound Hath glided to my side; I know ye near, Yet pause not from my task to look around With lifted glance, for, Halcyon! where'er Thou buildest for awhile, an atmosphere Of calm and quiet broods about thy nest; O thou beloved inmate! not a Guest Art thou, in any house, in any heart, For so thy presence makes itself a part Of all, we feel it like an unexpressed Sweet thought within the soul that gives it rest, And needeth not to be in words confessed; So moving on as if some inner law Of music graced thy steps, we only find And feel thee in our lives, because we draw An easier breath through mingling of so kind And pure an element! thy soul doth lose No odour, yet around it still diffuse A charm within whose concentration lies The secret of thy strength! oh, Rose full blown, That wearest still the bud's soft grace, unstrown Are all thy petals; provident and wise, Thou hidest from the day's too-curious eyes The dews the morning gave thee, and dost fold A leaf above thy heart, but with no cold Reserve, for still its sweetness overflows. I question now thy Future: on what breast Wilt thou at length thy perfect bloom unclose? I know not, yet I know thou wilt be blest! TO THE AUTHOR OF ZISKA. Not like the Sophist, of his phosphor-light Enamoured so, that he would blot out one By one God's lofty candles, fain in night To plunge the nations, so that for a sun They come to bow before his counterfeit; And not like him—of mocking smile, the dull Cold Scorner, ill-content the heart to cheat Of Heaven, but trampling out the Beautiful From Earth, to make life's ruin more complete,— Art Thou, oh, erring Genius! not for thee Their high emprise, to drag Humanity About the miry streets, and hold to scorn This vesture God hath fashioned, God hath worn; Dry, hopeless hearts, dry, loveless, tearless eyes! Thou Youth of lofty dreams, of generous prayers, Come out from them, and better recognise Thy place! thy lot can never be with theirs! For speaking to the Father thou hast said, “Give Thou to me, oh, give that I may share With them that need, Thought's true and living bread, Whereon the soul that feedeth hath to spare.” Then turning to thy brethren, taking up Thy country's ancient war-cry, thou dost call With Him, her blind old Chief, “I claim a Cup, The Cup of freedom and of light for all;” Oh, never be thy prayer, thy claim denied Of God or Man, but as thy soul doth yearn May'st thou receive in measure far more wide Than thou dost ask! thy thirst be satisfied By waters wrung from out a fuller urn Than thou dost dream of now; Oh, goodly tree, Though set so deep within the jungle-brake, The trees that in God's garden Ezekiel xxxi. 8, 9, 15. planted be Might envy thee thy beauty! yet they take A mourning up for thee, because the snake Is gliding 'twixt thy roots; with burning breath These flowers of thine, of Loveliness and Death Show forth the fearful spousals; from the Vine That hath thee in its clasp drops poison-wine. Yet dost thou struggle upwards from this lair Of doleful things, and even now the air Of open heaven hath fanned thy topmost bough. Lift higher o'er these under-growths thy brow, And look on Jacob's tents that whitening lie Within the sunshine; hearken to the cry That rises from among them: in their shout For One. a Brother and a King, thy prayer Doth meet its answer. Spirit, that through doubt Hast kept thy hold on fervent Love, come out From this dim shade, thy portion waits thee there! REST. This life hath hours that hold The soul above itself, as at a show A child, upon a loving arm and bold Uplifted safe, upon the crowd below Smiles down serene,—I speak to them that know This thing whereof I speak, that none can guess And none can paint,—what marks hath Blessedness, What characters whereby it may be told? Such hours with things that never can grow old Are shrined. One eve 'mid autumns far away I walked alone beside a river; grey And pale was earth, the heavens were grey and pale, As if the dying year and dying day Sobbed out their lives together; wreaths of mist Stole down the hills to shroud them while they kissed Each other sadly; yet behind this veil Of drearness and decay my soul did build To music of its own a temple filled With worshippers beloved that hither drew In silence; then I thirsted not to hear The voice of any friend, nor wished for dear Companion's hand firm clasped in mine; I knew, Had such been with me, they had been less near. PART FIRST “In this book regard rather the affections than the expressions; Love is the speaker throughout, and if any one wish to understand it, it must be by Love.” St. Bernard on the Canticles. TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. Thou Mother stern and proud, That carest not to hear about thy knee The singing of thy children; absently Thou smilest on them, listening for the loud, Quick crashing of thy chariot. What to thee Is pastoral stop or reed? thy thoughts are vowed To tasks of might, and thou thyself wilt be Thy Poet, finding in thy stormy tunes Rough music, leaving on the rock thy runes So dinted deep, no Bard hath need to tell The triumphs of a march where chronicle And deed are one. What carest thou for praise Of gentle-hearted singers! Thou wilt raise The crown to thine own brows, and calmly claim The Empire thou hast won; as yet no Name Is thine to conjure with, as in the days When Giants walked on earth,—a spell more clear Is thine in thought, that makes an atmosphere Where all things are gigantic! portents vast Loom round thy path, where good and evil cast Increasing shadows that the Evening near Foreshow; as yet no Prophet doth appear In all thy sons, and he among the rest Most wise and honoured found, is but the Seer That reads thy signs, interpreting the best! TO AN EARLY FRIEND. Beneath the tree we played Together, Thou and I! the sunshine fell Betwixt the boughs, and on our faces laid A loving finger, marking, where it strayed, A Dial for the hours, whose very shade Was but a softened brightness, for the place Wherein we dwelt was Eden! Through the wild The man must journey, yet methinks the child Should stay within the garden! with the Race Should run the mortal's history, and trace From those blest bowers its chequered chronicle! We played beneath the Tree; We did not pluck the apple; little taste Was ours for fruit of knowledge! little haste To lift unbidden hands when ours were full Of flowers and purpled berries, beautiful, That grew around us; but the apple fell Beside our feet, and through its sight and smell Instructed, now we good and evil knew,— So must we bid that pleasant place Farewell. Yet well for us that there We dwelt awhile! oh, well for us to make Acquaintance soon with all things glad and fair; To have them for our earliest friends! to take These playmates to our bosoms ere more stern Companions meet us, for they oft return And hold us by the hand, and for the sake Of Eden love us! Now its Angel knows Our faces through all change, and oft from far Hath smiled upon us kind; he will not close The gate so surely, but that Love ajar Hath held it for a space, and Dreams aside Have turned the Flaming Sword, and been our Guide O'er half-forgotten tracks; and on the wind, Like kisses blown upon it, greetings kind Send whispers after us, to half recall Half-presage glories, that no Primal Fall Hath robbed us of; for Heaven had been less near Had we not gazed up to it through the clear Calm eastern skies, that, waking or asleep, Bent o'er us in our childhood like a deep Unvexed, unfathomed sea, when it was Prayer To know, that day and night upon us there Our Father's eyes looked down; “Our Father!” First And Last in Love's blest language! we were nurst Within Thy breast, Thy sapphire floor for roof Was over us; and now less far aloof We view Thy awful Throne, that then we played Beneath Thy footstool, and were not afraid! And well for me that there We played together! in my heart, thy Book Beloved from olden days, thou wouldst not look So oft or fondly, maybe, flung aside With childish things, but for its margin wide With pictures stored! Yet now we will not take This love of ours to pieces; who would strew A blossom, leaf by leaf, to learn it grew As grow the flowers? Now love me for the sake Of blessed Eden; if thou wilt, believe Me fairer than I am! it will not grieve My soul to borrow of thy wealth, and be Attired in splendour that belongs to Thee: Thou givest freely, for the heart is wise And bountiful and rich; with naked eyes It seeth never; like a child that takes Some thing of little price that nearest lies To be its treasure, well content it makes From out its very joy its Paradise! OLD LETTERS. Within an ancient Hall Where oft I love to wander, once I found An antique casket, that without a sound Flew open quick, and as a Rose will fall To pieces at a touch when overblown, So was the floor around me thickly strown With yellow leaves, the letters of the Dead: Oh, hands that wrote these words, oh, loving eyes That brightened over them, oh, hearts whose prize And treasure once were these, by Time made Heir To this your sometime wealth, with pious care I gather in my hoards; for this is dust Of human hearts that now I hold in trust, And while I muse above it, spirits flown Come back and commune with me, till the fled Pale ink reveals two names that now have grown Familiar to my soul, as I had known And pitied them in Youth; in parley soft I win their secrets forth from them, and oft Make question of their Past! Did Love find rest And fold its wing where it had made its nest So warm and deep, or were these of the strong And patient souls, condemned, though wedded long, To serve for the other duteously, and wait Upon a harsher Laban,—Life, that proves With grievous, stern delays each heart that loves? O gentle spirits, all your lives on high Are written fair, but mortal history Is traced upon the sand that may not keep The dint of wave, so quick the dash and leap That follows on—a picture on the wall— A name upon the stone—a leaf whose green Less quickly fades, because it once hath been Within the Dove's soft beak, and this is all. I. I write to thee in cypher, even so Doth not the heart write ever? being proud, It careth not to boast its wealth, nor show Where lie its precious things by speaking loud. And here, upon my page an uncouth sign Would say, “I love thee;” further down this mark Shows plain, “for ever,” yet the sense is dark To every eye that looks on it but thine. So is it even with my heart, thine ear Can catch each broken whisper it hath used; So even with my life; thou makest clear Its meaning, oft-times to myself confused; The souls that use one mother-tongue are free To mould their rapid speech, but when from thee I turn to others, straight I have to choose My words, as one who in a foreign dress Must clothe his thought, speaks slow in fear to err, Interpreting himself; We do but guess At one another darkly 'mid the stir That thickens round us; in this life of ours We are like players, knowing not the powers Nor compass of the instruments we vex, And by one rash, unskilful touch, perplex To straining discord, needing still the key To seek, and all our being heedfully To tune to one another's: Ours were set Together at the first; each hand could move Like a skilled Master's, knowing well each fret And chord of the sweet viol he doth love, All up and down each other's soul, and yet, Call forth new concords,—now with softer kiss I move o'er other souls in fear to miss Their latent charm; these too, if better known, Were worthier prizing; “Though I love my friends dearly, and though they are good, I have, however, much to pardon, except in the single Klopstock alone. He is good, really good—good in all the foldings of his heart. I know him, and sometimes I think if we knew others in the same manner, the better we should find them. For it may be that an action displeases us which would please us if we knew its true aim and whole extent.”—From the Letters of Meta Klopstock. Love's great charity Hath taught this lesson, as beside her knee I stand, and child-like con it o'er and o'er, “Through loving one so much love all the more.” II. Oft have I bent my gaze Adown our Life's steep edge with eye-balls dim And thirsting soul, a-weary of the day's Hot parching dust and glare; this Well is deep, Too seldom rise the waters to its brim, And I had nought to draw with! oft in sleep I felt them touch my very lips, and flow All o'er my forehead and my hands, but, lo! I waked and thirsted; looking down, I knew Each pebble lying at the base, that drew A glimmer from the sunbeam; round the rim I knew each flower, each forkéd fern that through The stone did thrust its tongue, each moss that grew Far down its cool and slippery sides—I knew All but the water's freshness. Now I yearn No more in vain, no longer need I stoop So wistful o'er the well, for like an urn Is thy pure soul to me, wherein I scoop The waters as I list, and still return. III. We broke no piece of gold, We took no pledge of lock nor picture slid Within the breast, our faith was not so cold That it should ask for any sign! we date Our marriage from our meeting day, and hold These spousals of the soul inviolate As they are secret; for no friends were bid To grace our banquet, yet a guest Divine Was there Who from that hour did consecrate Life's water, turning it for us to wine. IV. Stern voices say, “Too much Thou givest unto one thy soul in trust; To frame such covenants with things of dust Is but idolatry, that to decay Doth quickly tend.” I answer not to such, But turning from them proudly, I appeal Unto my equals, “Perhaps love and grief may make me speak more than many will think fit. But though some passion blind the judgment, some doth but excite it to duty, and God made it to that end. And I will not be judged by any that never felt the like.” —Richard Baxter on his Wife's Death. none but those that feel Shall be my judges in this question; nay! I will not unto these my cause unseal, But bear it to a Court where I shall find A yet more patient hearing; far more kind The Father than the Brethren! He who made The heart doth know its need, but what are we, And whence have we our wisdom, unafraid With hands unskilled to vex a mystery We cannot disentangle? Yet I speak Too harshly in this matter, silence best Becometh happy spirits; hearts at rest;— O Love, thy gentleness hath made me meek! V. Upon thy lips this name Of mine so softly taken, first became That which it is in very deed, the name Most Christian and most kind, by which I claim A wide inheritance;—and I have borne This name so long, and only yester morn Have learned its sweetness! so doth life—our field Redeemed for us—but slowly, slowly yield The treasure hid within it! all our less Would grow to more, and this our Earth to Heaven, Might we but pierce unto the blessedness That lies so near us, might we but possess The things that are our own—as they were given! VI. I turn from things behind; They lose their savour! now that on the core Of Life content I feed, I fling the rind, That once looked fair, aside for evermore, For I have pierced beneath it. Since my eyes Have looked upon thy face, to all things wise, And pure, and noble, they have clearer grown; But careless are they to the vanities That once could hold them chained. I stood alone To watch the long procession that yestreen Moved through our city stately to the flow Of martial music; then I saw thee lean From out a balcony, and all the show Went by unmarked of me, as we had been Alone beside the river winding slow;— So doth this world's fair Pageant pass me by, I see but thee! yet do not therefore grow Unmindful of its goodly company: I tracked those glittering ranks until they stayed Within the square, and passing through the door Of the great Minster, took within its shade The sunshine after them; like One that prayed In silence, seemed that multitude, before So bright and jubilant, now only made The stiller for its vastness, as the sea Doth soothe the sense with wide monotony Of quiet waves unstirred. I saw thee kneel Afar; the organ, as it were the Soul Of many human souls, that did reveal Their secrets, sighed, as on its stormy roll It gathered them; my silent spirit drew More close to those who prayed with me; I knew That each of these still faces, where I see No charm to bid me look again, doth make The sunshine of some eye, and for its sake The heavens and earth look fairer: each that here Doth kneel, is loved of some, or hath been dear— The treasure of some heart beneath the sod. Oh, we are held unto the other near When each is dear to one—and all to God! AFTER PARTING. O Love, O Death! how sweet, How strange are ye! oh Parting! that dost stand Between these twain, from touch of either hand— One warm, one cold, thou winnest strength to meet Thy hour and overcome it! Tenderness And woe are twins! and may not deeply bless Except together, when the tear one weeps Falls in the golden cup the other keeps Hid for this moment in his breast, unshown Till needed most; When Love must leave its Own Belovèd, loved unto the end, it broke Its vase of costliest odours; though it spoke Before as none have spoken, then its tone Was fullest, clearest; breaking hearts have flown To fasten on those words, “Be not afraid!” And aching spirits, desolate, have grown Like limpets to this Rock, “now have I prayed The Father for you, and ye are not lone,— I leave you not uncomforted.” E'en so Full oft since then hath Parting made us know A Heavenly Presence; while we broke our bread With bitter herbs, the words were not our own That then we spoke, and we were comforted. For there is concentration in strong pain That draws the soul together; it can hold Its breath beneath the waves, and like a bold Strong diver, desperate will snatch and gain What calmer moments fail of. One of old Spake, looking on his judges, “Soon I die; So gather up my words that are not vain,— The lip of Death turns speech to prophecy.” So hath the parting hour its agony Of inspiration: All our path with dew Was drenched that autumn morning; like a day Begun too soon, our Life before us lay In early chillness,—hard to live it through Without each other! slow our footsteps drew, And slower, to our bourne, because they knew They measured off the moments we must spend Together; we were silent—friend to friend Was near as yet; at last thou spakest low My name, and whispered, “Bless me ere I go!” Oh, then I sadly thought, but did not speak: How may I bless thee, I, oft proved so weak, So poor in blessing that I can but love, Nor even bless through loving? I will seek For that I cannot give. “May One above, Belovèd, love thee, keep thee, bless thee still!” I spake these words in sadness, but a flame Did sweep them from my lips; the next that came Was even as a Message,—“and He will!” IN ABSENCE. And quick as when a blush Drinks up within its hasty glow a tear From off the cheek, within that sudden gush Of warmth our sadness grew to better cheer. Not now so wide, methinks, not now so drear The blank that parts our lives, for Love between Keeps ever moving; even now I ween Thy task becomes less hard! for sacrifice And patience are thy path, which ever lies O'er odorous herbs; but other destinies And other toils are mine, and, like a goad, The thought of thee doth urge me on the road Where thou dost wait me: but lest this should fail,— For Hope, the lover's friend, grows sometimes pale In musing o'er his fortunes,—oft to me A surer aim is present: I would be Of thee more worthy and of Him that blest My life with thine, and thus I cannot rest; Spurred on by noble discontent, my care Is still to make this proud, unquiet breast The fitter for the flower it may not wear! THE FIRST LETTER. Not since the breeze that took Thy soul by kind surprise, and turning o'er Its pages on a sudden, let me look Upon my name ere yet thou wast aware (Keep thou that leaf turned ever down, that there The book may open soonest!) have I known A moment like to this; I keep thy seal Unbroken, as it were thy hand in mine; I hold it clasped in silence, till I feel A warmth hath reached my spirit; then I ope These pages, confident as one with Hope In certain league; I need but touch this spring That now I play with to and fro, to bring Thy Presence on the stillness; these enclose Thy spirit shut within them. Even now Thy soul's breath is upon them—as a Rose Fresh plucked and dewy with the morning, thou Hast sent me of thine inner life that glows In sweetness; fain am I, yet know not how, To send thee thus each fancy as it blows; But while I gather these my thoughts, they fade, And pressed upon the page their colours fly, And all their sap runs from them, wan and dry, Like withered flowers within a herbal laid; And this may be, perchance, because my heart Hath been alike their cradle and their tomb, Close folded there too long, their hues depart,— Yet press them unto thine, and they will bloom! SILENCE. I turn unto the Past When I have need of comfort; I am vowed To dear remembrances: most like some proud, Poor Noble, who, on evil fortunes cast, Has saved his pictures from the wreck, I muse Mid these that I have gathered, till I lose The drearness of the Present! On the hill That noon in summer found us; far below We heard the river in a slumbrous flow Chide o'er its pebbles, slow and yet more slow; Beneath our feet the very grasses slept, Signed by the sliding sunbeam as it crept From blade to blade, slow-stealing with a still Admonitory gesture; now a thrill Ran lightly through the wood, but ere to sound The shiver grew upon the hush profound, It died encalmed; methought a Spirit's sigh Had then been audible, but none came by To trouble us, and we were silent, fed With golden musings by our friend that read From out thy chosen Poet; in a hall Of mute expectancy we stood, where all That listened with us held their breath unstirred; When suddenly the reader's voice let fall Its flow of music; sweet as was the song He paused in, conquered by a spell more strong, We asked him not its cadence to recall. It seemed as if a Thought of God did fill His World, that drawn unto the Father's breast, Lay hush'd with all its children. This was Rest, And this the soul's true Sabbath, deep and still. Then marvelled I no longer that a space Is found in Heaven for Silence; so to me That hour made known its true sufficiency, Revealed not oft below, because its place Is with the Blessed! Speech is but a part Of Life's deep poverty, whereof the heart Is conscious, striving in its vague unrest To fill its void; but when the measure pressed And running over to its clasp is given, It seeketh nothing more, and Earth is blest With Silence—even such as is in Heaven! IN ILLNESS. I sunk beneath the wave Of sleep, not drawn as oft by visions light And soothing as the hand of Mermaid white, But by intolerable pangs that drave Me downwards, plunging like a diver keen For some unrestful pause, some blank between The fiery chinks of anguish, dimly seen And deeply longed for; yet I might not stir. All day, beneath a cruel armourer, The Hours—like weary slaves—slow, silent, pale, Wrought link by link their iron mesh of mail About my senses; now a brief escape I won, but after me a wingèd shape, Most like a wild and weird musician, threw His hand 'mid shattered chords, and did renew The day's slow-dying torture. It was Pain That held me—only lengthening out its chain, And through its glare unmitigable drew Strange forms from out the darkness;—oh, the steep, Rock-girdled citadel of rest to gain, And so escape them! but I strove in vain; For sleep hath its two Worlds! a lower deep Within its deep still opens! Night is kind As is the Day, so one doth fold behind Its light, and one in darkness shroud a worn And spectral Realm; but now the veil was torn, The gulf yawned wide, and down amid the waste And leavings of existence, charred, defaced— It sucked my soul; 'mid living agonies I walked, on old disquietudes forlorn I stumbled as I trode; I saw them rise And point at me, a lifetime's mockeries, The dreary phantasms of giants shorn And crippled of their strength; on swords that gleamed 'Mid oozy weeds, deep bedded to their hilt,— I gazed, and seemed no more like one that dreamed. Once were these girt for valiant enterprise; I know not now if it were sloth or guilt That rusted them, for all things did perplex My spirit, dragging it among the wrecks Of heart and brain; hard stony eyes were set On mine, with endless questionings that met No answer; Then I know not how the strife Gave way; and passing through that outer court Of giddy cries confused, I gained the shrine Where sleep is kindest, holiest: too divine Those eyes of hers for sadness, and for sport Her brow too tender! Then she laid on mine Her hand, she pressed it with a hallowed sign,— And all its throbbings vanished; It was Night I stood with thee within a garden; Night, Yet never hath the Noonday been so fair, For all the air was luminous, and white Was every flower that grew around us there; We did not marvel at their fragrance rare; Their bloom was but the breathing in of light That paled into a subtle odour; these Were gentle ghosts of flowers that other where Bloomed many-coloured 'neath familiar trees; Now calm as spirits passed away in prayer, Large-leaved and beautiful the Jessamine Hung forth her stars; the Rose did half resign Her empire with her blush, and over all The Lily reared her blossomed sceptre tall; While at our feet the Violet's purple fled Would whisper mutely of a wound that bled No longer, then I know not what delight Fell on our asking spirits that addressed Each other on the silence, “All is drest For Death or for the Bridal, each is white And each is solemn, each hath won for guest An Angel, and we know not which is best.” VII. “The Heart is a Clock that gives warning before its Hour strikes.” Before they met they loved; Their souls fore-felt each other: passing through This life's dim treasure-caverns, on them grew A whisper, clearer as they onwards moved; “There is a Sesame that opens to Yet richer chambers,” so like Him who drew The perfect circle of our globe, and proved, That waiting for him on its margin (where He knew not yet), A World in summer air And muffling leaves and greenest quiet slept Until he came to wake it, they were 'ware Of this bright realm, this Virgin of the Sun, This bride unsought, unwooed that should be won. But of the luxury, the wealth it kept In store, its gorgeous wilds, its solitude Instinct with life, its tropic shade and glow Alternating, they knew not, nor could know. Yet, as they neared that shore, the deep was strown With drifts of fragrant things,—and seawards-blown, Strange birds with sunshine warm upon them, clung About their masts, while evermore, like tales So vague and sweet that spoken language fails To catch their music-meaning, gentlest gales Curled up the waves before their prow, and sung And whistled clear within their fluttering sails, To lure them to the country whence they sprung. So when they met they loved; They took not counsel of the Eye or Ear; These are but erring vassals, and the clear Soul-region in its rarer atmosphere Needs not their failing witness. This was June, The noon of Life,—the heart was at its noon; A noon by Summer lulled to sleep, and hid Beneath its leaves, half-stirring to a tune Self sung in happy dreams; while sunshine slid Adown the hill's steep side, and overtook And meshed within its golden net, each nook O'ershadowed with dark growths, and filled each cleft, And thunder-splintered chasm storms had left; When these two mounted on a blissful tide, Sailed each within the other's soul—no oar Flashed light along their way, no canvas wide Impelled them; but a steadfast current bore Them o'er the level champaign, till they neared A Palace, where, through open gate and door, They gazed together on the land that lay Before them, glittering peak and gleaming bay, As on a country known to them before, Though unbeheld; and even as a King Upon his crowning day new robes will fling On all around him, so each common thing Stood forth in light apparellèd, and took Its hue and semblance even from the look They cast upon it; yet, thus venturing, I speak not wisely,—nay, these only took Their pristine hues—their colour that forsook And fled, when Man with Death upon his track Went woful forth from Eden's gate, came back When Eden's tongue was spoken! and the smile That Nature 'neath her Mother's brow of care Hides in her loving eyes, dawned bland and fair To see her children's gladness; so the while They sat beneath one crown, upon one throne, And wrapped within the purple, o'er their own Stretched forth the sceptre; never dial flung Its warning shadow, never iron tongue Knelled forth the busy hours; Note C. they took no heed Of Time or of his flight, For still doth time in days of blessedness Appear to stay upon his constant course, Then flows no sand, then strikes no warning bell; Oh! he is fallen from his Heaven already Whose thoughts are heedful of the changing hours— The happy hear no clock.”—Wallenstein. nor had they need: For they together with the world were young, And ever would be! Life in very deed Held back for them no Future, and the Past Lay calm before them in a mirror glassed To feed sweet fancies, showing how it led To this bright now; so all things ministered And wrought their bidding; here they deemed it well, Like her who said, “I sit a Queen,” to dwell In joy for evermore; but change befell. They parted but they loved; How could these part? what sword could be in life To sever hearts like these? Methinks its strife Should but have proved the furnace in whose glow The fiery bars of metal fuse, and grow More close together welded; even so. But in this world of ours the heart, though strong And armed and watchful, never holdeth long Its own in peace; for sure as to the moon The Ocean rises, here a steadfast law Doth hold or rend asunder hearts that draw Together, restless till they meet, then soon Divided, and for ever; it would seem That God hath made these loving hearts and bold, For Him and for His world that lies a-cold For lack of generous fuel, not to fold Their warmth within each other, but to stream Afar and wide, with broader, purer gleam. How this may be I know not, but I know That never more within our hearth-light's glow These sat together; never, gazing through One lattice, watched the sky; but when they knew Their paths were severed, rising, on their way Went forth before the breaking of the day, And parted on Life's cross-road,—not before Each lifted up a voice of weeping sore, And blessed the other's journey! So they moved (In tents abiding) through new lands that bore No likeness to the country where of yore They dwelt together: other scenes and looks Grew round them; other hearts became the books They read and mused in; other trials proved, And other blessings gladdened, yet they loved. They parted, yet they love; And shall these spirits in an air serene, Where nought can shadow, nought can come between, Meet once again, and to the other grow More close and sure than could have been below? Or will that State, that blissful Commonweal, Leave, each of all possessing, room to feel For other bliss than merges in the flow Of Love's great ocean, whence these drops did steal To Earth of old, and wandered to and fro? —I know not of this now, but I shall know. VIII. Thou camest in a dream,— So sudden taken from my life that now 'Mid all Earth's strangeness, it would strangest seem To feel thy hand meet mine in greeting,—Thou That clasped it once so close! but seas have swept Between us, silken Spring-times have unrolled Their bursting green, wild Autumns shaken gold Upon our paths, since last I looked on thee; And on our Life's great organ suddenly Have keys gone silent, whence the music rolled In blissful waves; but still through manifold Swift change and dreary pause our hearts have kept (Like quiet watchers left in peace to hold A tryst with Thought, while others deemed they slept) The steadfast secret of our Love untold. Together and alone We stood: they have not loved who have not known What meaning lies in those two words—alone, Together and alone! And ever went a dash Of tinkling, chiming waters through my dream, As of a brook that sends a quiet flash Through tangled boughs, and ever golden brown From wet bright stone to stone goes lapsing down; There oft we stood with hands together locked, And lips whose gay and wandering converse mocked The deeper oracles that ran below Light words, light leaves, clear waters in their flow— Till through those wood-aisles dim A breath of soul, a consecration-hymn Rose gradual on the summer's sunset glow. Then came an hour that tore Our lives asunder, but within my dream Far, far away did change and parting seem As waves that chide upon some distant shore; Our hands were locked, our lips—we did not speak, Our very souls were locked,—we did not seek For word, or look, or outward token more; It was not Heaven, because we were not glad, It was not Earth, no future made us sad, But in a calm, unshadowed land between, Our spirits loosened from their bonds terrene Did meet, and commune in a language clear, Of things that they had known and suffered here— And I awoke and knew thou hadst been near! TO A LONG-PARTED FRIEND. “That I never made use of your stay here to unite the present with departed days is one of the things—there are not a few of them—for which I can never be consoled; it was as though a spell lay upon me; I felt it would be enough to speak one word, but that word I could not unclose my lips to speak. The Past could not rise again from its grave, and I felt as though it would have shaken the foundations of that Present, which it is now my duty to preserve and develop. My mind is like a nation that has passed through a revolution, and must proceed in a new order, the old order being irrevocably destroyed. . . . Yet how was it with me after you had gone?” —Niebuhr to Count Adam Moltke. I. As by a camp-fire in the wilderness Two hunters meet, that o'er the Prairie long Have roamed on distant tracts companionless; So to this city, drifted by the stress That draws the nations hither—in the throng We stood together in this mortal press A moment face to face; Thou didst not guess At mine, and I—forgive me then this wrong— By favour of the light that fitful fell Did let thee pass unchallenged; so that look, Thine olden look, so long unseen, so well Remembered, troubled me; thine aspect shook The strong foundations of my soul, I knew It was the Past within its grave that drew A long, deep, sighing breath, and like a pent Volcanic force, this smouldering element Would kindle at thy glance; I felt a stir Among the ashes of a sepulchre Long sealed, long smooth with grass, with flowers o'ergrown, A word from Thee, and bursting through the stone The Dead had risen up! before one shrine We knelt together; though the fires are cold We lighted there, I deem that still we hold A mournful faith unto this worship old And lovely, counting it for half Divine. Now is that altar broken, and a sign From Heaven hath warned us hence—we may not bring The living Past again, we can but wring Its secrets from its grasp, disquieting Like one of old, with awful charm its sleep: Oh, leave its rest unbroken, I assign A day far hence to meet Thee—now thine eye Would vex me with its kindness, silently Would turn where mine is turning;—even yet, I am as one that wistful o'er a wave Stoops down, intent, and sees beneath it lie The fragments of a wreck, that glistering wet Tempt down the eager outstretched hand; I crave A little longer pause, for soon or late Come all things to a calm;—I do but wait. I turned, and thou wert gone— O then my heart rose sudden up and passed A hasty judgment; saying, I had cast A Life within that moment from me, more Than life would give again, and chiding sore Like one defrauded of its right, it took Its arrows tipped with olden love, a look, A word remembered barbs them—oh, my friend, I turn to thee for solace;—draw this glaive Deep plunged unto the hilt from out my breast! Thy hand it was unwittingly that drave It home, and none beside can give it rest; Speak comfort to my soul, oh reconcile My spirit with itself! upon thy track My heart runs after Thee; yes, mile by mile, It follows Thee, it does not call thee back! II. I said, I do assign A day far hence to speak with Thee; if late Or soon it fall, I know not, for its date Rests not with me, but One above, who draws Our ruins to an order through the fine And ceaseless working of His kindly laws; For we are hasty builders incomplete; Our Master follows after, far more slow And far more sure than we, for frost and heat, And winds that breathe, and waters in their flow Work with Him silently; we stand too near The part as yet to look upon the whole; That thing which shall be doth not yet appear; It is not with the eye but with the soul That we must view God's work; Of when and where We ask not wisely; if our meeting were Delayed indeed, until no more to part We meet at last within a Mansion fair Where there are many such, would this impart A sadness to thy spirit? heart with heart May commune safely when the Master's art Hath tuned His perfect instrument! below We learn not half its sweetness; not for men Its broken strings are joined; it keeps its flow Of music for the Land where none again May wring its chords; Yet even here, I know, Are seasons calm and glad that antedate The coming in of happier cycles, where The human soul, too long left desolate Shall reckon up its Sabbaths, and repair Its pleasant things laid waste; upon that Rest Together we shall enter! we shall share Its joy above, below,—as God deems best! TO ? ?. “Then, towards the right, I saw a cloud of the colour of opal, and towards the left, a dusky cloud, and under both, the appearance as of a falling shower; under the latter, as of rain at the end of autumn, and under the former, as of dew at the beginning of spring, and immediately I returned from the spirit into the body, and from the spiritual into the natural world.”—Swedenborg. I. I say not to Thee, “Dost Thou mind Thee how that eve above the dell We sat together?” for I know thou must Remember it, as I remember, well. I held thy hand in mine; We spoke of many things, with frequent calm Of tender pause between; the air was balm That stirred the pages of the Book we held Betwixt our hearts, till by their warmth compelled, We brought its faded characters to shine Upon us, tracing them with finger fine Still further back, and when, upon a word We paused, that time had worn, or grief had slurred, Our spirits drew the closer, till at last I read, as if by hearth-light flame, each line Within the glow thy soul around thee cast, Whilst thou didst read them by the light of mine. And loath its clasps to close We hung above that Book; we kissed its leaves, And marvelled at their fragrance, till a rose Dropt from them, gathered once when summer-eves Were kindest, it had withered there—the bloom Had fallen from it, yet, within its tomb It strewed with odours all its winding sheet— Fragrant in life, among the dead how sweet! I held thee by the hand; The evening deepened round us, still we read, Evoking those old spells, till from the Dead We summoned up our Youth and saw it stand Before us beautiful! upon its brow Sat pain and sweetness mingling, even now I know not which was victor; then we took Our counsel with the pages of the Book To reckon with it harshly, but this dust Turned on us sudden with the look of yore— And of the wealth it took away, the trust It broke with us, all question we forbore. But even as a child, Lured by a bird's clear singing, makes a track Within the wood's deep heart, did fancies wild And lovely draw us further, further back; Until, 'mid windings green and lone we felt Our feet were deep in flowers we loved before Those grassy paths brake sudden, and we dwelt In Arcady no more! We murmured, “Yea, no more We know our Eden's place, yet is it well; Although the gate be barred for us, the Door Is ever open.” Suddenly there fell A glory from the Heavens, and all the dell Was filled with quivering light, as in a cup Its woody hollow caught and kindled up The sun's last sinking flashes; on the sky There was no cloud, no flaming bar, no line Of fire along the West, but solemnly Heaven glowed unto its depths, as if the curse Were lifted upwards from our universe One moment's Sabbath space, and only Love Stooped down above its World!—so from above A smile dropt visibly on Earth, that prest To meet that sign of reconcilement—blest On brow and bosom blest. We spoke no more; Our souls were silenced; then we thought to fold The pages of the volume worn and old That still lay open, but the sunlight fell And tracked each letter luminous and bold, Until it shone a golden Chronicle,— O sweet, sad Book, traced o'er With marvels! light must fall Upon thy page from Heaven, before We see that Love writ all! II. Then while we mused, a word Fell on us, spoken once on desert plain, “Go, gather up these fragments that remain, And store them carefully, that none be lost;” And at that Voice methought the ashes stirred Within the Vale of Vision; Ezek. xxxvii. sere and dry Each severed hope, each shred of memory Did shake and come together. Suddenly Our life from days when infancy was sweet Stood up before us, all from head to feet Transfigured fair. “How holy is this place!” I said, and wist not what I spake; methought I felt like one upon his journey brought By ways he knows not of; these pathways dim Had ever seemed their promised end to cheat, Yet had they led to Him In whom Life's tangled, broken threads complete Are gathered up, its wasted things made meet For holier use, its roughness smoothed, its bitter turned to sweet! Then saw we how this hour That we had chidden with, this mortal life, That broke its faith with us, had not the power To keep it better; weariness and strife So marred its gentler purpose; yet comprest Among its thick-set thorns, because the air Did breathe about it all too chill and rare, Our Past had held our Future, like a Rose That may not yet its perfect soul disclose, Lest angry winds should scatter and molest; So shut within this narrow bud, its woes Were but the crumpled leaves too closely prest; And all its loveliness did but enclose The germ of after beauty, now a Guest, But soon to be a Dweller! So we stood, While gradual to our feet the shadows fell; We looked abroad, and all was very good; On all within was written, “It is well;” For things that were and would be met and kissed Each other in the heart, that like a child For loss of each bright joy that it had missed, Was by a loving promise reconciled! TO A DISTANT FRIEND. INSCRIBED TO D. E. L. “There are wonders in true affection.” Religio Medici. I knew not ye were sad, Dear distant friends of mine! Across the sea Ye sent me only tidings making glad, And all was gladness round; for Life to me Had grown a summer's day, whose very air Was luxury to breathe, and on Love's fair Smooth forehead lurked no folded plait of care; Yet, borne I knew not whence, a sadness stole, Disquieting the music of my soul With dreary change; as one that, feasting high At some great banquet, feels a tremor chill Pass o'er him, and, grown sudden pale and still, Sets down his brimming goblet with a sigh, So all the wine of my felicity Was mixed with tears! oh, strange that now the cup Should shrink within itself, and narrow up For fulness poured within it! dark distrust Was this of God, and servile fear, unjust To Love's ungrudging sunshine: I would pray, And so this heaviness should pass away; But when your names arose that ever there Are nearest to my spirit, all my prayer Was stayed upon their sound, as when a strain Recurring oft unbidden, will enchain The sense to track its cadence, I must pause Upon these words that ever on my way O'erlook me urgent, “Pray yet longer, pray For them thou lovest,—is there not a cause?” And even then ye wept; And even then o'er Desert and o'er Sea Were deathful tidings speeding on to me, That knew them through a steadfast pulse that kept Its pace with yours; I needed but to tear My festal robes to show the sackcloth bare They hid; and even with the iron tongue That knelled your loss, a warning presage flung Across my path the shadow of your care! And quickly hath this keen Vibration brought us to the other near, Because the air betwixt us was serene; And calm as when on mountain summits clear, We count distinct the fall of distant bells, So is there stillness round the soul that dwells In Love! The spirit loosened from the jar Of earthly turbulence, can hear afar Belovèd footsteps stir, and thus we prove Through very pain the comforting of Love. For we have parted at a wrench from all The things we held in common, so that now One wears the rose of joy, while on some brow Or in some bosom best-beloved, the thorn Is rankling deep; for now we may not press Each other's hand or lip, we do but guess At one another's faces far withdrawn. And one is crowned and robed, while one forlorn Doth sit upon the ground; our lots are cast So wide, upon the waste your whisper dies, And while we tell you of our smile it flies. For even while we speak with you—so fast Life's golden sands are fleeting—unto Past Our Present darkens! Yet the heart hath set Its calm Eternal Dial to a Sun That changes not. Oh, friends, we had not met E'en when together; heart when drawn to heart Most near, had shrunk and shivered, held apart By chillness from within—more blank, more keen Than seas that roll, than winds that sweep between, Except for Him who holdeth even yet Our souls in one. Oh, Love, that doth o'ersweep The gulfs of Time and Space, and o'er our sleep And o'er our waking brood, if dear and near Are one in thy blest language even here, How may it fare with them that on a shore Where none are parted, none are troubled more, A little farther from us dwell, set free From bonds that fetter here.—And may there be In heavenly harps a chord that vibrates still In swift yet painless unison with ill That mars not perfect music? Yet I cast My plummet down a mystery too vast For mortal line to fathom. Deep to deep Doth call, yet wake no answer. Love will keep This sweetest of its secrets till the last! TO MY FRIENDS AT ?. This love of ours hath been Awhile mislaid, it never could be lost; I did not fear for it, yet somewhat crossed My spirit mournfully, as o'er the grass The little cloudlets darken as they pass. It was a shadow from without that swept The sunshine off our spirits, yet I wept, So much I missed that sunshine! Sad and strange It seemed to me that any chill should creep Across our Love; yet patient o'er its sleep I watched and warmed it safe through every change, Until it wakened smiling! All things came As they had been of old, yet not the same, For nought returns again! but far more sure, More deep our trust, more fitted to endure Life's changeful skies; we mourn not for that fled First April bloom; we count not up the cost Of that sweet blossom on the breezes sped,— The ripened fruit need fear no after-frost! MEETING. Oh, how elate my look,— Far down the thronged and lighted table sent Upon a careless quest indifferent,— Met thine in mirthful flashing! Then we took Our leave together, and, like boys released By the glad stroke of Noonday, from the feast Went home beneath the star-light. Oh, that night, How shall I e'er forget it! At a bound My spirit rose, a river that had found Its level on a sudden; forth in chase Quick vagrant fancies rushed as in a race, Unemulous and glad; while at the light Of those wild torch-fires solemn thoughts and deep Enkindled clear, as on a northern sky, Through Borealis gleams that flash and leap, The stars look down. What was that hour to me! What is it now! My soul hath been more free, More noble, since that meeting; to the laws Of this strange country for awhile in pause Content to hold my breath; with step more bold Because my wings have grown, I walk these old Accustomed pathways. Earnest Friend, thy youth Of soul makes all things fresher; in thy truth Grows all more true, more real; come and hold Thy mirror to my soul, that I may be The more myself for having been with thee! PARTING. TO E. L. R. We parted not like lovers in their youth, Fond pledge and promise eager to renew, But e'en like steadfast-hearted friends whose truth, Tried by world-wear, world-change, soul-conflict, knew Its strength and rested; so our words were few. We parted with the clamour of the street Around us thick, yet secret, lone, and sweet Was our communing. Then I did not say As oft of yore, “Dear friend, when far away, Remember me,” nor thou, “Forget me not.” What is this life that Thou shouldst be forgot For all that it hath yet to give me? Nay! In this world or the next I count to be Rememb'ring and remembered; we have shared The cloud and sunshine here, Eternity Will never blight the flower that Time hath spared! TO A DEPARTED SPIRIT. “And there in Abraham's bosom, whatever it be which that bosom signifies, lives my sweet friend. For what other place is there for such a soul?” St. Augustine's Confessions. Oft was I wont to pray For thee in olden days; our spirits knew A common travail, and upon the way We never stayed to commune, but we drew A comfort from the other, inly cheered; So knowing of the things beloved and feared Of thee, O gentle Spirit! as before I walked, an elder pilgrim, o'er and o'er I scanned the ground for thee, and it was sweet To think that after me thy tender feet Might find a smoother path; when suddenly Thou didst o'ertake me with a footstep fleet, And wingèd, turning on me such a bright, Sweet, joyous face, I knew that thou hadst neared Thy journey's end, and even then appeared The long-sought home, the Father's house in sight; While from its flaming windows all alight Came festal sounds. Then, Friend beloved, for thee I could not pray as once, though still arose Thy name because of use, would somewhat say, “Pray not for her, but for thyself and those Who linger far behind; the little way That she hath yet to travel, like the rose Doth blossom, paved with love; her kindred wait E'en now to welcome her within the gate; But ere their dancing and their songs resound, Her spirit rushing on before, hath met The Father coming forth; her cheek is wet With reconciling tears. Oh, wake no sound, She seeketh nothing further! she hath found Him whom her soul desired by night and day,— What wouldst thou ask for her?” Yet must I pray For thee, so spake I soft, “The stream is wide That lies between; oh, gentle be its flow When she doth cross,”—that boon was not denied. Now that thy feet upon the hither side Stand firm, I charge thee, Friend, by all below That knit our souls in one, that thou dost take This music from my lips, for thou canst frame Its flow more fitly; only change thy name Belov'd, for mine. I lay on thee this task, Entreat for me. “Brother Bradford, as long as I shall understand thou art on thy journey by God's grace, I shall call upon our Heavenly Father for Christ's sake to let thee safely home, and then, good brother, speak you, and pray for the remnant which are to suffer for Christ's sake, according to that thou shalt then know more clearly.”—Bishop Ridley writing to Bradford the Martyr. for thou hast drawn more near God's gracious heart, and closer to His ear,— Nay! thou dost pray for me, I need not ask! PART SECOND. “Thoughts too deep to be expressed, Yet too strong to be suppressed.” —George Wither. THE RECONCILER. “And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me, ‘Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book.’” The Revelation of St. John. All things are reconciled In Thee, O Lord! all fierce extremes that beat Along Time's shore, like chidden waves grown mild, Have crept to kiss Thy feet! For there is no more sea Within Thy kingdom; so within Thy reign Are no more tides that murmur and complain, Like ancient foes that seem through some dark law Their life from out each other's hate to draw; So Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, set Against the other's being, strive, and yet Contending mix, while caught and driven by winds So keen and restless in their rage, the Will, Drawn hither, thither, trembles, till it finds Its centre, and is still. Then nothing is displaced, Thou drawest all things to an Order fair; The things we treasure most with those our haste Doth count for nought, alike in Thee are graced With beauty past compare. For all grows sweet in Thee, Since Thou didst gather us in One, and bring This fading flower of our humanity To perfect blossoming, All comes to bloom! this wild Green outward World of ours, that still must wear The furrow on its brow, by print of care And toil struck deep; this world by Sin made sad, Hath felt Thy foot upon its sod, and smiled,— The desert place is glad! Thou madest all things glad As they were good. When first Thy sunbeam flew Abroad, it lit on nothing that was sad; So now is all made new That meets in Thee! Thou takest—for thy birth Is of the Morning's womb, and so the dew Lies ever on it—of the things that Earth Hath left for waste, their freshness to renew. Him most of all, the Chief Of things thy hands have fashioned, sorest curst Yet holding still the First-born's Birthright; first In grandeur and in grief. Of old perplexed he stood And questioned much with things that did appear Of things that were. and for the unseen Good He sought 'mid present shows, but neither ear Was there, nor voice to give an answer clear; So listening oft, O Thou, Desired of all, To hear afar Thy coming footsteps fall, Thy shadow on the murky atmosphere Grew gross and palpable, and soon his sense Discerned not well if foe or friend were near; While whirling, ringing still from sphere to sphere Of widening thought, went up his bitter cry Of “whence” and “why,” and evermore this whence And why did clash together for reply. Until for aye to quell This battle, that had grown for him too sore To bring his foes to silence, and compel His doubtful friends to weary him no more, With changeful aspects and with frequent strife, Thou camest suddenly: And first with Life Thou madest friends for us; our lives in Thine Grow kind and gracious, Lord! when Thou didst make Thy soul an offering for sin, Thy love Was even unto Death; yea, far above, For Thou didst suffer Life for us. “We bear with life for the sake of Him who suffered both life and death for us.”—Pascal. to take More hard than to resign. And since this garment old And fretted by the moth Thy love hath borne Upon Thee, all that wear it in its fold With Thee enwrapt and gathered, have grown bold, To Thee and to each other closer drawn; Pale grows our purple pride Beside this vesture dyed In Kingly blood; before our common name We feel our titles but a gorgeous shame, That doth betray, not clothe, our nakedness; But Heaven and Earth have been More near, since Earth hath seen Its God walk Earth as Man; since Heaven hath shown A Man upon its throne; The street and market-place Grow holy ground; each face— Pale faces, marked with care, Dark, toil-worn brows—grows fair; King's children are these all; though want and sin Have marred their beauty glorious within, We may not pass them but with reverent eye; As when we see some goodly temple graced To be Thy dwelling, ruined and defaced, The haunt of sad and doleful creatures, lie Bare to the sky, and open to the gust, It grieveth us to see This House laid waste,— It pitieth us to see it in the dust! Our dreams are reconciled, Since Thou didst come to turn them all to Truth; The World, the Heart are dreamers in their youth Of visions beautiful, and strange and wild; And Thou, our Life's Interpreter dost still At once make clear these visions and fulfil; Each dim sweet Orphic rhyme, Each Mythic tale sublime Of strength to save, of sweetness to subdue, Each morning dream the few, Wisdom's first Lovers told, in stately speech, Within the porch, or underneath the beech, If read in Thee comes true; And these did mock the other, saying, “See These dreamers,” but in Thee Their speech is plain, their witnesses agree; So doth Earth mock the hearts' fond Faiths and rend Our idols from our failing grasp, and fling Dust, dust upon our altar-shrines, yet bring No worship in their place, but Thou, O Friend From heaven, that madest this our heart Thine own, Dost pierce the broken language of its moan— Thou dost not scorn our needs, but satisfy! Each yearning deep and wide, Each claim is justified; Our young illusions fail not though they die Within the brightness of Thy Rising, kissed To happy death, like early clouds that lie About the gates of Dawn—a golden mist Paling to blissful white, through rose and amethyst. The World that puts Thee by, That opens not to greet Thee with Thy train, That sendeth after Thee the sullen cry, “We will not have Thee over us to reign;” Itself doth testify through searchings vain Of Thee and of its need, and for the good It will not, of some base similitude Takes up a taunting witness, till its mood, Grown fierce o'er failing hopes, doth rend and tear Its own illusions grown too thin and bare To wrap it longer; for within the gate Where all must pass, a veiled and hooded Fate, A dark Chimera, coiled and tangled lies, And he who answers not its questions dies,— Still changing form and speech, but with the same Vexed riddles, Gordian-twisted, bringing shame Upon the nations that with eager cry Hail each new solver of the mystery; Yet he, of these the best, Bold guesser, hath but prest Most nigh to Thee, our noisy plaudits wrong; True Champion, that hast wrought Our help of old, and brought Meat from this eater, sweetness from this strong. Oh, Bearer of the key That shuts and opens with a sound so sweet Its turning in the wards is melody— All things we move among are incomplete And vain until we fashion them in Thee! We labour in the fire, Thick smoke is round about us, through the din Of words that darken counsel, clamours dire Ring from thought's beaten anvil, where within Two Giants toil, that even from their birth With travail-pangs have torn their mother Earth, And wearied out her children with their keen Upbraidings of the other, till between Thou camest, saying, “Wherefore do ye wrong Each other?—ye are Brethren.” Then these twain Will own their kindred, and in Thee retain Their claims in peace, because Thy land is wide As it is goodly! here they pasture free, This lion and this leopard, side by side, A little child doth lead them with a song; Now, Ephraim's envy ceaseth, and no more Doth Judah anger Ephraim chiding sore, For one did ask a Brother, one a King, So dost Thou gather them in one, and bring— Thou, King for evermore, for ever Priest, Thou, Brother of our own from bonds released— A Law of Liberty, A Service making free, A Commonweal where each has all in Thee. And not alone these wide, Deep-planted yearnings, seeking with a cry Their meat from God, in Thee are satisfied; But all our instincts waking suddenly Within the soul, like infants from their sleep That stretch their arms into the dark and weep, Thy voice can still. The stricken heart bereft Of all its brood of singing hopes, and left 'Mid leafless boughs a cold forsaken nest With snow-flakes in it, folded in thy breast Doth lose its deadly chill; and grief that creeps Unto thy side for shelter, finding there The wound's deep cleft, forgets its moan and weeps Calm quiet tears, and on thy forehead Care Hath looked until its thorns, no longer bare, Put forth pale roses. Pain on thee doth press Its quivering cheek, and all the weariness, The want that keep their silence, till from Thee They hear the gracious summons, none beside Hath spoken to the world-worn, “Come to me,” Tell forth their heavy secrets. Thou dost hide These in thy bosom, and not these alone, But all our heart's fond treasure that had grown A burden else: oh, Saviour, tears were weighed To Thee in plenteous measure! none hath shown That Thou didst smile! yet hast Thou surely made All joy of ours Thine own; Thou madest us for Thine; We seek amiss, we wander to and fro; Yet are we ever on the track Divine; The soul confesseth Thee, but sense is slow To lean on aught but that which it may see; So hath it crowded up these Courts below With dark and broken images of Thee; Lead Thou us forth upon Thy Mount, and show Thy goodly patterns, whence these things of old By Thee were fashioned; One though manifold Glass Thou thy perfect likeness in the soul, Show us Thy countenance, and we are whole! THE QUESTION. “Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”—John xxi. 15. Lord, didst Thou turn Thine eyes On me, and speak upon this solemn shore The words that wounded with a keen surprise Thine erring, loving servant, grieved the more That love, as doubtful of its own, should seek To put it thrice to proof; I could but speak With Him; I could but say, ‘Below, above Thou knowest all,—Thou knowest that I love.” But canst Thou say with Her, The Bride of ancient Song, “My soul hath found Him whom it only loveth? wilt Thou stir And quit me now for these that stand around— Am I more dear than these?” I answer, “Yea, Than each, than all more dear! I could not stray From Thee, O Shepherd, skilled with silver sound Of voice and hand attuned, thy flock to please And lure them o'er the mountains, knowing best Beside what streams, beneath what spreading trees To solace them, to give their wanderings rest; Why should I ever leave Thee? which of these Hath charm so sure?” “Yet hast Thou never feared To gaze on these around, lest they should grow Through fairness to thy soul too much endeared?” “Nay, this I fear not, since I learned to know A truer fairness, lighting on the Rose That doth within its folded breast enclose All fragrance, being as the soul that glows In every other flower, I wander free About this earthly garden; sweet to me Its blooms and safe! for they that of Thy wine Have tasted, will not from its strength decline For any meaner cup! they love not Thee Enough, who fear that any else should be Too much beloved!” So spake I over bold, And knew not, Lord! that round Thy Tree of Life The serpent still doth twine with deadly fold; I knew not then the thrice-refinèd gold Was thrid with baser clay; that still the strife Goes on, till Death doth part 'twixt things accurst And things of blessing; severing best and worst That grow together—easy still to miss And hard to win—Thou knowest, Lord, of this, Thou only knowest, what are we to speak? Yet, Thou hast spoken, “Blessed are the meek,” And “they that mourn are blessed.” I can touch This border of Thy garment; now I know I love Thee, Lord, I will not let Thee go; I will not ask, “Are these beloved too much?” Too little, Lord! because my heart is cold In loving Thee! I make with one of old This fervent prayer, Do Thou enlarge my coast And o'er it rule Thyself! where Thou art most Beloved, is room for all! the heart grows wide That holdeth Thee! a Heaven where none doth press Upon the other, none of more or less Doth ask solicitous, for ever there Is bread enough, and fulness still to spare, And none that come depart unsatisfied.” FORSAKEN. Martyrs, through fire and steel Have felt the tracking of the steadfast eye Of faithful friend or kind disciple nigh That strengthened them; beside the cruel wheel Hath Woman waited, wiping from a face Beloved, the damps of anguish; kings in chase Upon the mountains held from day to day, Have leaned on peasants scorning to betray The baffled hope, the head discrownèd: nay, A hand unseen upon a tyrant's tomb Hath scattered flowers; so strong above disgrace, Despair, and death, rise human hearts; of whom— King, Martyr, Malefactor—is it said That all forsook him, all forsook and fled, Save of One only? Human love forsakes Yet is not all forsaken! He that takes This drear pre-eminence of woe, alone Forsaketh never—never! He hath known That pang too well; O Saviour, with Thine own Too little seemed it for Thy love to share All bitter draughts, so hast Thou bid this cup Pass from our souls for ever, drinking up Its wormwood and its gall, our lips to spare. THE LESSON. I said, This task is keen— But even while I spake, Thou, Love Divine, Didst stand behind, and gently over-lean My drooping form, and, oh! what task had been Too stern for feebleness with help of Thine? Spell Thou this lesson with me line by line, The sense is rigid, but the voice is dear; Guide Thou my hand within that hand of Thine— Thy wounded hand!—until its tremblings take Strength from Thy touch, and even for Thy sake Trace out each character in outline clear. THE TWO RELIGIONS. The heart is like the World— A dreamer, yea, a Pagan in its youth; It takes its visions—being fair—for truth, And seeks no further; loving best to brood In lonely thought, it throngs its solitude With wondrous shapes, it flings upon the air Its Shadow, worshipping before that fair And floating semblance! caring but to please The noble and the beautiful, for these? Its flowery altars shine; it will not seek Communion with the baser crowd, in scorn It holds all lowly things, and for the weak It takes no thought; Yet hath this haughty creed Been found too narrow for its scope, too cold E'en for the soil that raised it; in its need The spirit turns from its as from its old Fond faiths the Earth revolted—each hath tried And each grown weary, casts the broken chain Away, to greet a purer Worship, wide As is the world that it was made for, warm As Heaven that it was sent from; it hath place For all, it gathers in a wide embrace Things dis-esteemed, it goeth forth to seek The things that none desire; its words are meek Yet eloquent; it loveth in the shade Of inner calm to muse, yet will not shun The Many, looking in the face of One Divine, yet like unto His brethren made! LOVE. O Love, thou goodly child, Though not its own, the World makes much of Thee! Thou mindest me of him, from out the wild Bulrushes drawn, and at a royal knee Brought up with songs and nurtured tenderly. Sweet songs are sung to thee, yet thou dost sing Far sweeter back, because the mystic bee Hives ever on thy lips, and Egypt's king And courtiers, failing of thy company, Would wearier grow of all their pageantry Than infants of their toys that for the moon Cry out. Yet thou thyself dost weary soon Of Egypt's hollow show, and being grown To thy full stature wilt no more disown Thy country and thy brethren; thou wilt turn To share their task-work, yet wilt not unlearn The precious lore of Egypt; and the songs That Pharaoh's daughter taught thee wilt recall Full sweetly on thy harp of many strings— Thou needest them, to plead thy people's wrongs Thy Master yet may send thee before Kings! IN SADNESS. A child in sickness left behind its mates Upon a summer holiday, from tears Refrains himself a little while, and waits Perchance in hope to see some comrade kind Come back to play with him, but no! he hears Their voices die away, and up the hill Now, thinks he, they are climbing, now they wind Along the hedge-row path, and now they find The berries that o'erhang it; even now The red ripe nuts from off the hazel bough Are dropping fast, and then across the brook He hears them shouting to each other, through The alder-bushes. So his thoughts pursue Those wand'rers on their way, until his look Steals wistful to the sunshine, and his book Drops from his hand; what would he with that glad Free company? too weary for their glee, Too weak to join their sports—yet he is sad; Then comes his mother, lifting tenderly Her darling on her knee, and all his day Glides peaceful on, though none come back to play. The house is very still; none come between Their quiet talk, she smiles on him serene, He speaketh oft to her of those away; So, Father, I am lfet! I will not mourn To follow after them, so I may be The closer to thy heart;—so I am drawn Through stillness and through sadness nearer Thee! THE SUMMONS. Methought from out the crowd a steadfast eye Did single out mine own! a voice Divine Was borne within my soul, in tones that made Such depth of music there, the sense did fade Through sweetness that it kindled; Lord, for thine I knew the voice full well! and yet I heard Of all Thou spakest then one only word; My Name! Thou calledst me! I must prepare For Thee this day! and wilt Thou come and share My Mid-day meal, while I with heart elate Shall wait on Thee, or wilt Thou rather wait On me, Thy servant? through this noon-tide glare Thy Banner drawing tenderly, to spread An early dusk that I may lay my head The sooner at Thy supper on Thy breast? It matters little, Lord! or come or send— Take Thou my spirit hence, or like a Friend Make Thou thy home within it,—I am blest. PAX IN NOVISSIMO. “He gave her therewith a sure token that he was a true messenger, and was come to bid her make haste to be gone. The token was an arrow, sharpened with love, let easily into her heart: —so Christiana knew that her time was come.” Not like the rulers of our vanities At earthly feasts, art Thou, O Love Divine; These pour their best at first, and still decline At each full-flowing draught, till only lees Of bitterness remain, but Thou dost please To keep unto the last Thy richest wine. And now, this grace-cup, crowned with flowers, o'erflows To meet my lips, the music never fell More sweet, yet from the banquet, ere its close, I rise to bid the company farewell; I see no sign, I hear no warning bell, No airy tongue my Summoner hath been, Yet all my soul by cords invisible Is drawn the surer unto One unseen; For oh, my Father! whom I have desired By night, and sought for early, not through Man Or Angel have I at thy voice inquired Since first my solemn quest for Thee began; Thee, only Thee my spirit hath required For Teacher and for Counsellor and Friend; So now Thou needest me, Thou dost not send By any other, but within the shade Thy awful Presence makes, ere yet the fall Of evening darkens, I can hear Thee call, “Come home, my child!” and I am not afraid; Though oft Thou showedst me a brow austere, And oft thy lessons hard to understand Were grievous to me, now Thou drawest near I see Thy smile, “Rabia, a devout Arabian woman, being asked in her last illness, how she endured the extremity of her sufferings, made answer, ‘They who look upon God's face do not feel his hand.’” —Milne's Palm Leaves. I do not feel Thy hand. And He, our Brother kind, Wounded and grieved by us, yet waiting where He passed before our Mansions to prepare, Made himself strange at first; I did not find An instant welcome; oft with speech severe He questioned me, and oft methought his ear Was turned away, but now I feel his tear Upon my cheek, his kiss upon my soul; He biddeth all withdraw, while with His Own He talketh: “How is this, Thou hast not known Thy Brother? I am Joseph,”—now no more Doth Love refrain itself because its goal Is well-nigh won, and all its trial sore O'erpast, it leaveth with a brow serene The secret Chamber where so oft unseen It wept before; For ofttimes Love must grieve; For us content and willing to be sad, It left the Halls wherein they made it glad And came to us that grieved it! oft below It hides its face because it will not show The stain upon it! now I feel its clear Full shining eyes upon me, and I know Soon I shall meet the kiss without the tear! For all my life grows sweet, I know not how to name it; from behind Comes up a murmur voluble and fleet Of mingling voices, some were harsh, some kind, But all are turned to gentleness, the wind That bears them onwards hath so soft a wing, As if it were a Dove unused to bring Aught but a loving message; so Earth sends One only question on it from the track Where I have passed, “Friends, friends? we part as friends?” And all my soul takes up and sendeth back One word for echo and for answer, “Friends.” And, oh, how fair this Earth I leave!—methinks of old I never took Account of half its loveliness and worth; Yea! oft I mourned because I could not look More deep within the pages of this Book, God's glorious Book shut in between the eves And glowing morns, I read betwixt the leaves Like one that passes hastily, and failed To catch its import, yet hath One prevailed To loose its golden clasps, and on her knee He biddeth Nature lift me tenderly And read thereout her Fairy tales, and tell Where lie her treasures guarded with a spell. She takes me to her heart, she will not hold A secret from me now! things new and old She brings to please me. Yet, as if she knew— A loving nurse—that soon her child must sleep, And waken in a land where all things keep Their first simplicity—she doth renew Her forms that charmed me earliest; With the dew Still hanging round them, well I know these flowers She holds before me; through the noon-tide hours I looked not on their hues; they did not burst To gorgeous life, like some that I have nursed, Shut from the ruder air, until they caught Through each broad leaf a colouring of thought, And spake a symbol-language too intense, The while each lamp-lit urn Did glow and spread and burn Its heart away in odours, till the sense Waxed faint through fragrance; not like these of bold Magnificence, nor dearer flowers that grew Familiar by my path, with whom of old I talked so secretly, it seemed we drew A common breath, until methought they took A human aspect, and like friends that know Too much the heart's deep history, their look Hath oft-times troubled me; But these did blow For me in meadows wide, ere yet I knew That flowers were charactered with joy or grief; Ye hid no secret in your folded leaf,— Flowers innocent and cool That hung above the pool, Or thrid with gold the pleasant pastures through; I learnt no “Ai, Ai,” in your school, Quaint orchis, speedwells blue, And slender cups that grew Deep in the woods, pale purple-veined and brimming o'er with dew! I see the quiet glade Slope sunward, shut among its hills that lie With light upon their brows; I hear the cry Of wheeling rooks, the little brook goes by And lifts a hurrying voice as one afraid To linger on its way; within the shade Moss-cushioned now I sit, where once my day Cast all its wealth of Summer hours away Upon a book of Marvels; sunbeams hid Among the boughs came trickling down, and slid From page to page to light me on my way; —The charm that fled, the glory that forsook Flow back upon my spirit; I am glad Of ye, sweet scenes, sweet thoughts! I know the look Ye turn upon me, it hath nothing sad; Long, long ago, yet not through blame of mine I left you far behind me on my track, Now flits the shadow on Life's Dial back, Twice ten degrees to find you! things Divine Are imaged by the earthly, it was meet That I should gather in my soul these sweet, Long-parted childish fancies ere I go Where none but children enter; Even so; I sleep at noon; all household noises cease, No voices call me from without; the room Is hushed and darkened round me; through the gloom One friend beloved keeps moving to and fro With step so quiet, oft I only know Her presence by her gentle breathing,—Peace! A MEDITATION. “I believe in the Communion of Saints.” The World doth love its own, Doth praise its own, doth keep their memories young; Where warrior once hath bled, where poet sung, Time's dust may never gather,—hill and stream Catch up heroic echoes, and the lone Vaucluse still murmurs of the music thrown Around it by one fervid Lover's dream. The World doth love its own, But unto you that loved it, hath it proved It was not worthy of ye! little loved Or loved amiss, how hard hath been your lot! Followed with worship that ye had disclaimed And warned each suppliant, “See thou do it not,” Or like to cherished friends that on its throne The heart hath lifted, till too rudely blamed For overprizing, it hath grown ashamed, And taken from them that which was their own, So are ye little treasured, coldly named, Remembered with vain honours, or forgot! And ours hath been the loss: Our silence grieves you not, our erring praise Perchance doth never reach you where you raise Your fuller, sweeter song to Him whose brow Doth wear the Many Crowns upon it, “Thou Art only worthy, Thou who art our Praise.” Yes! ours hath been the loss, For ye are ours! the lives ye held not dear Were given for us! strong champions of the Cross Who went before us in God's faith and fear, Your blood makes rich our heritage; no tear Of yours but lies upon it still like dew, No word of yours but yet hath power to cheer— Ye have not need of us, but we of you! And oh, Beloved ones, my lips are fain To speak of you! this heart of mine so long Hath communed with you, they may not refrain To pay you honour in a guileless song; I will not fear to do the Master wrong In praising you, His servants, whom, unseen, I love in Him. As oft a stranger's mien Grows sudden dear through summoning the face Of friend beloved, so have I joyed to trace Your features back to His, and in the tone Ye use, a sweeter voice hath still been known; Nor read I blame within their ardent eyes, Our elder, stronger Brethren of the skies, That unto me their names, their effigies Have been less dear than yours, who did not move About your work with them Ezekiel i. 14. whose feet of flame Upon their Master's errand went and came As in the lightning flash; with footsteps slow And wearied oft, kind ministers! Ye went About this lower House of His, intent On humblest household tasks, and for the sake Of this great family, with care opprest, That it might fare the sweeter ye did wake Betimes, and watch that it might safer rest. Ye wore not then the Halo on your brow, “Elias was a man of like passions as we are,” says St. James, “to wean Christians from that false idea which makes us reject the examples of the saints as disproportioned to our own condition; these were saints, we cry, and not men like us. We look on them as being crowned in glory; and now that time has cleared up things, it does really appear so. But at the time when the great Athanasius was persecuted, he was a man who bore that name; and St. Teresa, in her day, was like the other religious sisters of her order.”—Pascal. But bound on rugged paths where once of old Your Master toiled, where toil your brethren now, Ye had not Angels for your mates, but cold Dull hearts were round you, that within your own Ye warmed, till oft their chillness deadly grown Hath made your hands, hath made your bosoms ache! For oft, methinks, true Lovers! loved the less For more abundant loving, bitterness Was wrung within your cup while ye did strain Thereout your balms of healing; yea, the Vine Was bruised within your souls to make them wine That trampled down its tendrils! yet this pain Ye took in meekness, nor of outward foe Made much account that knew a subtler foe, A sorer strife, a plague-spot lying bare To one loved eye, and fain ye would be fair To meet that only eye;—so, faint yet still Pursuing, oft ye look unto the hill From thence expecting aid, and not in vain. Now have ye reached the Mount of God! no stain Lies on your robes, and all your faces shine As shone they never here, while yet in frail Coarse vessels all your heaven-won treasure lay, While oft the light within would pale and pine Because the lamp that bore it was of clay— Now, far behind the shrouding veil, your way Leads on from grace to grace, and yet you say “Here it is good to be:” of this your state We know not now, but this still doth appear; Though none have left the chambers where ye wait To tell us if their light be dark or clear, And he who looked upon you there, the Seer Beloved, hath spoken little, if ye wake— Or sleeping, where you take your solemn rest— Yet hath a voice from Heaven proclaimed you surely blest! And if ye wake or sleep, Or wrapt yet conscious in a Calm between That stealeth not on Earth, ye lie serene, Doth matter little—solemn, sweet and deep Must be your rest with Him whose eyelids keep Their watch above, for He can bless in sleep His own beloved ones; But is there prayer Within your quiet Homes, and is there care For those ye leave behind? I would address My spirit to this theme in humbleness: No tongue nor pen hath uttered or made known This mystery, and thus I do but guess At clearer types through lowlier patterns shown;— Yet when did Love on earth forsake its own? “Fain would I know thy present feelings towards thy Broher, thy beloved, if indeed it is permitted to one bathing in the floods of Divine radiance, and transported with the happiness of eternity, to call to mind our misery, to be occupied with our grief. For perhaps though thou hast hitherto known us according to the flesh, yet now thou knowest us no longer. He who is joined to God is one spirit with God; he can have no thought, no desire, save for God and for the things of God, with whose fulness he is filled. Yet ‘God is love,’ and the more closely a soul is bound to God, the more does it abound in love. It is true that God is impassible, but He is not insensible, for His ‘nature is to have mercy and to forgive;’ so then, thou must be merciful, since thou art joined to Him who showeth mercy, and thine affection, though transformed, is no whit diminished. Thou hast laid aside thine infirmities, but not thy love, for ‘love abideth,’ saith the Apostle, and throughout cternity thou wilt not forget me. It seems to me that I hear my Brother saying, ‘Can a woman forget her sucking child? Yea, they may forget, yet will I never forget thee.’ Truly it is not expedient. Thou hast found greater consolations. Thou art in the everlasting presence of the Lord Jesus, and hast angels for thy companions; but what have I to fill up the void thou hast left? In all that has since happened I have looked to Gerard as I had been wont, and he is not.”—St. Bernard on the death of his Brother. Ye may not quit your sweetness, in the Vine More firmly rooted than of old, your wine Hath freer flow! ye have not changed, but grown To fuller stature; though the shock was keen That severed you from us, how oft below, Hath sorest parting smitten but to show True hearts their hidden wealth that quickly grow The closer for that anguish,—friend to friend Revealed more clear,—and what is Death to rend The ties of life and love, when He must fade In light of very Life, when He must bend To Love, that loving, loveth to the end? I do not deem ye look Upon us now, for be it that your eyes Are sealed or clear, a burden on them lies Too deep and blissful for their gaze to brook Our troubled strife; enough that once ye dwelt Where now we dwell, enough that once ye felt As now we feel, to bid you recognise Our claim of kindred cherished though unseen; And Love that is to you for eye and ear Hath ways unknown to us to bring you near,— To keep you near for all that comes between; As pious souls that move in sleep to prayer, As distant friends, that see not, and yet share (I speak of what I know) each other's care, So may your spirits blend with ours! above Ye know not haply of our state, yet Love Acquaints you with our need, and through a way More sure than that of knowledge—so ye pray! And even thus we meet, And even thus we commune! spirits freed And spirits fettered mingle, nor have need To seek a common atmosphere, the air Is meet for either in this olden, sweet, Primeval breathing of Man's spirit—Prayer! And now your prayers are free, Not hindered oft, as in this field below By One himself unblest, that envieth so The bonds of Brotherhood he may not know, He joys to fling a seed of enmity 'Twixt very friends;—with anxious hearts, with hands That rested not, ye wrought in scattered bands Apart; intent upon your work, a word Would reach you from the distance, faintly heard, That moved to anger; yet the speech that vexed The sorest, often was but Love perplext To find one common tongue; but now the sun Hath fallen on you, all your task is done; Ye sit within the House with One whose kind Prevailing counsels bring unto one mind Its inmates, making Brethren to agree, And oft ye marvel that ye did not find Each other sooner, soul in soul doth see One kindred image shine, no longer dim Through contact of its gold with baser clay— The fruit is ripe, its husks have dropt away, And ye are only what ye were in Him! Oh! Virgin Lilies rayed With light and loveliness, that did declare His perfect beauty here, that grew so fair By only gazing on Him! from the shade Where God hath planted me I have essayed To reach unto your sunshine! though you keep Your silence even from good words, I miss No sign of greeting, nor have need of kiss For sealing of our love, for this is clear That ye are near me when I draw most near To Him in Whom we meet: I see you shine In Christ, as once I marked above a shrine By midnight clear, yet moonless, pictured fair A Virgin Mother in a lowly place Bend o'er a sleeping infant; full of grace His brow and lip; with gifts and odours rare Came Kings adoring, lowly Shepherds there Rejoicing knelt, and all the canvas dim Was crowded up behind with Seraphim In goodly ranks; yet Mother-maid serene, Sage, Seraph, lowly Shepherd, all were seen By Light that streamed from out the Babe divine! EARLIER POEMS. ASPIRATION. O that my songs were sweet! Sweet as the voice of bird or breath of rose, Then would I lay them at His feet, From whom all sweetness flows. O that some sudden breeze Might sweeping cross my lyre, that once awoke The solemn murmurs of the cedar trees, Where man with angels spoke! That once the living coal Upon my lips, within my heart might lie, Within the secret chambers, where my soul Hath stored its imagery. That once the fire would break While I am musing 'mid the fancies lone That I have garnered, and Heaven's Lightning make The sacrifice its own! Then would I stoop no more Of earthly Love, of earthly Grief to sing, That met and mingled in their sighs, of yore So oft upon the string; For as the dew-drops dry On the bird's wing, exhaling in its flight, So mortal dreams would on my spirit die, Nearing the source of light; And like a flame that glows Steadfast before an altar, from the ground My soul would soar, and scatter as it rose Odours and light around! Yet since this may not be, Since, but before the Temple's Outer Gate, And not within its Inner Sanctuary I minister and wait; Still would I linger fain About that Porch, and patient strive to win A breath of sweetness for an earthly strain From all that flows within! Still would I strive to bring (E'en of the best I could) my gift, and twine Of earthly blossoms, soon awithering, A garland for that shrine; Flowers of the field and wood. Fading, and faint, and frail, yet haply there Received by Him that made them once so good, And keeps them still so fair! Pale blossoms, dewy-bright (For they are Earth's, that speaks through tears her love); Yet all their leaves unfolding to the light Of sunshine from above! MARY. Scene—A Farm in the Clearings of a Canadian Forest. Mary. You must not leave us yet awhile; the kindred That you are seeking know not of your coming; And so delay of yours can little grieve them, Were it a year, far less a single day— Traveller. Nay! I have far outstay'd my time already. Mary. But not your welcome, wait but till tomorrow, Then I will bid you speed upon your journey. Trav. So it was yesterday with you, good mistress, And when to-morrow comes 'twill be the same, Still you will frame some kind excuse to keep me,— And if I stay much longer it will be But all the harder then to leave behind me A house like this, where all is rest and comfort: For on the waves I have been tossed so long Like sea-weed, drifting, shifting, hither, thither Among the rocks and reefs, with nought to hold by, That Home, the sound we English love so well, Has been as strange to me as to those nations That have no word, they tell me, to express it; And in my heart, perhaps, I fain could find it, To cast my anchor in a spot like this, And stay till even one as kind as you are Might tire at last of the old, useless stranger. Mary. And what am I myself but old and useless? I sit beside the fire or in the sunshine, An old woman, good for nothing but to talk And please the little children with my stories Of the old country as they call it here; And they have heard my tales so oft, that when I chance to halt they quickly help me onwards; But since you came to freshen up my memory, Things half forgotten, thick as bees in summer, Have swarmed and crowded on my mind so fast, That I have store to last me out my life; I think it is your voice that brings around me The voices that were round me in my youth; You have not been, you say, in pleasant Yorkshire For half a lifetime, yet I think your heart Forgets it not entirely, while your tongue Remembers it so kindly. Trav. And so you know me for a Yorkshireman! And I that have been round the world so oft, 'Mid all my gains and losses, still have kept A touch that speaks of Home! well then, it seems The tongue is like the heart, forgetting slowly What it hath learnt the soonest; like the lessons That, taught in our first childhood, we remember When many a thing between escapes for ever. Mary. Nay, not in childhood only, but in youth,— The things that happened then so sweetly cross Our spirits, that I sometimes think they lie Within the heart, as when I was a girl I used to lay the things I treasured most, Strewed o'er with lavender and withered rose-leaves; There was a hymn-tune that but yesternight You hummed above my grandchild in its cradle, The good old Psalm, “How sweet to dwell as Brethren In kindness and in offices of love,”— Oh! how it brought the pleasant Sundays back, The Sundays when I used to sing it, sitting By William, looking both on the same book:— Here, one may say, 'tis evermore a Sabbath, Like the World's first One, when its Maker looked Upon his work and saw that it was good; There are no work-day sounds within these woods; Yet not so dear their deep unbroken silence, As was the quiet of the Christian Sabbath: The sweet unwonted stillness of the air When those sounds ceased awhile, and man with them Ceased from his labours, resting in the sight Of Him that gave that blessed breathing time. My father was a strict man in his duties; Careful, it might be, anxious overmuch For this world's substance, yet forgetting not To seek the truer riches, well he wrought His six days' labour out with the Commandment, And rested with it on the day appointed. I think I see him with his Sunday face, The face that suited with his Sunday garments, The wrinkles of the busy week smoothed down, Walking to Church with us his children round him, Never so happy or so proud as then, Exchanging, as we moved along, grave greetings With friendly neighbours, pausing on his way To hear the bells' last merry chime, and see From the stone gateway of the ancient Hall The good old Squire come forth with his sweet daughters. Oh! how I loved the Sunday! still I love it As the hymn teaches, best of all the seven: But then, I fear me for far other reasons Than make it dear unto my spirit now!— For then I sat by William in the church, And then I walked with William in the evenings, The long bright summer evenings—if I had A wish on earth, it was that all the week Were Sunday from one end unto the other, And Summer, only Summer all the year!— How often in my thoughts I walk alone O'er all the spots where once I walked with him, Talking at first of many things so gaily— Of everything except the only thing That both were thinking of, before he spoke And told me that he loved; when afterwards We walked o'er the same ground, how all was changed, For then we were too happy to be gay; I never knew what care or grieving was 'Till I knew William; but I never knew Until I knew him, that there is a joy Worth all we pay for it: yes! none so gay, So goes the saying, as the merry beggars With nought to care or fret for, nought to lose; But wealth brings care with it, and when the heart Grows rich, it watches anxious o'er its treasure With busy fears it never knew before; And we were grave and anxious, ofttimes silent Perchance, but never happier than then; And when the walk was over, and we parted, Still William leant across our garden gate, Still there seemed always something left to say, Still some last word yet sweeter than the last That went before it;—I should ask your pardon For wearying you with talk of these old times, But if I thus forget you are a stranger, Yours is the blame that make me to forget it, As there you sit and look so like a friend— Trav. I think your heart would entertain the stranger Where'er it met him, but it seems to me, The farther we have left our home behind us, The nearer do we feel to those that hold With us some link, though slight, in common there, As claims of distant kindred rise in value When closer ties have failed us,—meeting here, Both born in Yorkshire, we are friends at once, Old friends as we had known each other all our lives; And if you still will talk to me like one, I will put off my journey till to-morrow, Just for the sake of hearing you: for I Had once a home like yours, and there is still A chain between my heart and it that seems To tighten with each word that you are speaking. Mary. Ours was a pleasant farm: a sudden turning In a deep lane of hawthorn, white in summer With flowering elder, brought you where it lay Shut in among its close-clipped beechen hedges, Just like a place forgotten by the world; It was a sunny spot, and all around it A kind of cheerful stillness, broken only By noises that had in their very sound A sort of quietness, because they told That there were none but harmless creatures near; And all without us, all within, was quiet, For ours was a grave house; my mother died When we were young; my father, as I said, Was a strict man, though kind, or meaning kindly, Yet in his serious aspect and slow speech Was something that rebuked our childish mirth. We loved him as he loved his heavenly Father, Not with the perfect love that casts out fear. God's word was honoured in our house; we came, My father loved to tell us, of a stock That prized it so, they left their homes that were In foreign parts, and gave up trades and calling, Going, like Abraham, they knew not whither, Rather than give up that, the heritage More valued still, the word of Truth and Life; The spirit of those fore-elders lived in him; A serious spirit, yet perchance akin More to the rigour of the older Scriptures, Than to the second kindlier Dispensation; Living by law, and letter, and commandment, Yet lacking surely somewhat of the love The Gospel tells us best fulfils them all; But peace be to his memory! holding fast Integrity, he walked before his God One of a faithful upright generation The world, that loves them little, ill could spare. I was the only daughter left with him For many years, my sisters marrying young; And this, I think, because I knew his ways And kept the house for him and for my brothers, And looked to everything, might be one reason (Although he owned it not unto himself) Why still he put all talk of marriage by From year to year, and when we spoke of it, Still shook his head, and put us off with saws Made but to vex the trustful heart of Love, The more in that they bear some show of wisdom, Such as “Wed soon, and there'll be time for rueing,” “When poverty comes in, love takes his flight.”— Trav. (smiling) And William, then, I fancy, was not rich, Or, as they say in Yorkshire, well-to-do? Mary. His father died when he was young; his mother Had held a little farm not far from ours, As best she could since then, and William Had worked for her and for the younger ones, 'Till, as he oft has told me, he ne'er knew The feeling of being young or like a boy, The cares of life set in on him so early; And he was thoughtful far beyond his years, Although I do not think he ever had A thought except for others till he knew me, And then he said that Love had made him selfish In making him so happy, still contriving And planning how we might be happier still; We used to hope my father, when we married, Would set us up upon a larger farm, Where we could take his mother home to us, And William used to say, that he would wait As long for me as Jacob did for Rachel (Serving that hard apprenticeship twice over), But could not, like him, think it but a day! For time wore on, and still we hoped and waited, Until at last, with William and my heart Persuading me together, I began To think my father, that withheld consent Still for some fancied reason, might not grieve Perchance if it were taken without asking; I saw that he loved William more and more, And thought that he would end where I began, By loving him so much that everything I did for love of him would find excuse; And so at last worn out with hope deferred Too long (I tell you what you guess), we married When I was staying with some distant kindred, And spoke to none, not even William's mother For fear of mixing others with our blame; And I came home again; we fixed to speak Unto my father in some happy hour, And say what we had done, but much my heart Misgave me, and I could not bear to meet His eye, or hear him speak unto me kindly And know I was deceiving him, although But for a time: my youngest brother George, That in the world I loved next best to William, Just then came back from sea; we sat one evening Just as the short November day was closing All in our little parlour round the fire— My brothers had come home from work, my sisters Had both called in to have a look at George— I never saw my father seem so happy As then he did to have us all about him; And as they talked together in the gloaming I drew my wheel beside me, and seemed bent Upon my spinning, but I only hoped Its busy hum might still the busier thoughts That turned, as it was turning, in my brain: My father said, “Ay, Mary will not waste An hour as we do, there she sits and spins, Still for the wedding! well, when that day comes, No one will have a better plenished house Than she and William,”—almost before I knew what I was saying, as if then The words that had been framed upon my lips So oft before, to die there, came to life, I said, and did not tremble, “Oh, dear father, That day is past already, I am married”— “Married!” he cried, and started from his chair, “Who knew of this? who planned it with you? married?” I said, “We married when I was away— There is no living soul that knows of it Except ourselves;” he answered, “It is well, For then I have but one ungrateful child; Go to the home that you have chosen,—now You have no other; go unto your husband, And make to him a more obedient wife Than you have been a daughter—ay, make much Of him, for now you have not any Father.” There was a dreadful stillness in the room When he had done: it seemed to me all full Of stony faces, no one moved or spoke— I thought my sisters would have spoken for me, For they were married, and they must have loved, But not as I did, or they would have spoken, Their husbands were good men, but not like William; And there was silence, but I heard the words “You have no father,” sounding in my ears, And all things darkened round me—then I felt An arm that caught me ere I fell, and heard My brother George's voice that said, “Oh, father! You must forgive poor Mary; she has been Such a kind sister, such a loving daughter, The first offence, they say, should find some favour, And Mary never crossed your will before, And never would have done so, but for love Of William, that deserves her love so well.” But at his words my father's brow grew dark, He clenched his teeth as if to bar some word— I dared not stay to hear it, but rose up, And crying, “Brother, anger not our father For one like me, that have done too much wrong Already without that,” just as I was I went forth from among them to the darkness, And through it and a heavy rain that fell Unfelt upon me, made my way, nor stopped Nor even knew where I was going, till I found myself at William's mother's house, Wet and bewildered, choked with tears, scarce able To speak, or give an answer to their questions. Oh, what a different coming home to that I had so often pictured to myself! I used to think that were I but with William, No matter where or how, I must be happy; But now I found that we may buy the things That are most precious, at too dear a cost, With loss of conscience and the peace of mind That goes with it—for I was with him now, But not the thought that we were one for ever, That I belonged to him, that nothing now Could part us, no, not even William's words Could ease the aching anguish of my heart; And when he found he could not comfort me, He ceased to speak, and held my hand in his, Blaming himself in silence; so we sat Together, feeling we had left behind us The little Eden of our happy thoughts, Where we had lived so long, like our first parents Cast out by disobedience; when we heard A knock, and George looked in with anxious face That brightened when he saw that I was there: His was a cheerful honest face, that seemed To have a comfort in its very look; Not then alone, but many an aftertime Only to see him lightened half our cares, And if he found us anxious, still he left us, Sometimes we scarce knew why, with happier hearts; His was a hopeful, generous, kindly nature, That ever turned things to their brightest side, Or made one for them out of its own sunshine; He did not, like my other brothers, rest Content with wishing well to us, but left No way untried to bring my father round; But all in vain, yet still he cheered us, saying, The good time would not fail to come at last; Before he left he brought us all his savings, They were no use, he said, to him at sea, And all things were a help to new beginners— Oh, sir! you are a Sailor like my brother, You have a kind heart, I am sure, like his, To listen as you do; he went away, My brother, my dear brother! little then I thought that I should see his face no more,— I stood with him beside the garden gate (The gate where I had so oft talked with William), One starlight night, for I had set him home To see the last of him—oh! how I grieved To think that I, who used to set his things In order for him when he went away Like any Mother, dared not now be seen Within the house! and after we had parted, I heard him calling after me so kindly (The last, last words I ever heard him speak), “Keep a good heart up till we meet again, All will come right, dear sister, in the end.” Trav. And did your brother's parting words come true? Mary. Yes, after many days—but first I suffered Much, and in many ways, but most in mind. Things did not thrive with us; I used to grieve About my father, thinking I had lost Perhaps for ever for myself and William The promised blessing; feeling oft as if My Heavenly Parent's love had gone with his; I lost a little girl, the only one I ever had; I surely was not worthy, That had myself so sorely failed in duty, To know the comfort of a daughter's love; Then William's kind, good mother too was taken; In those few first years of my married life, Our lot was crossed by poverty and sickness; Yes! many trials, many cares were mine, But never, never one that William caused me; The things we prize the most are ofttimes used To chasten us—it was not so with me; Heaven was too kind to send my punishment Unto me by the hand I loved so well! I oft have heard grave people at my father's Talk of the sin of loving over-much, Forgetting the great Giver in his gift— To me it seems we best remember Him By prizing, loving all the things He gives In Him, the Giver,—loving them the more Because He gives them; just as we would wear A token from some cherished earthly friend Upon our hearts, as if we could not hold It there too closely for the giver's sake, That gave it not for slighting. These were times Whose very troubles seem to have their dearness For the one happiness that ran all through them; But those days passed, and as the proverb tells us, The darkest hour of life, as of the day, Is that before the dawning, even so It was an evil chance that wrought the change That rolled the heavy stone from off my heart. My father who was now well up in years, Yet never seemed to feel their weight, so strong The spirit that was in him, late and early Still working with the foremost, in the field As they were bringing home the hay, was struck By an unruly horse; the loaded wain Passed over him before a soul could help, And he was brought back to the farm for dead, Senseless and crushed—oh! what it was for me To meet him for the first time thus! for me Who now might stay beside him with the rest (So is there comfort in the saddest things) Nor fear to anger him; I kept my place Beside him day and night, and when my sisters Sank, worn and wearied past their strength, in me Something there was that could not tire nor rest, Which used to make me wonder at myself; There was one thought upon my mind that bore me Through all, a wish so like a fear, it trembled, Because I dared not turn it to a prayer; I had no right to weary Heaven for favours, Too happy if I might but win its pardon; And yet although I asked it not, I trusted— Through goodness giving more than we dare ask— My father's soul might come to him again Before he died, to bless and to forgive me. Trav. And it was granted you? Mary. Weeks passed, and then My father's mind returned as clear as ever, But life was shattered in him, and we saw His days would not be many for this world; He spoke unto me kindly, and seemed pleased To have me near him (I that always knew His ways so well), yet never named the past, Or mentioned William,—yet still I hoped; For the strong spirit was subdued within him; He lay as weak and helpless as a child. And like a child his Father called him home, So gently, that I cannot think but God Whom he had followed from afar, yet truly, Was gracious to his spirit at the last, And to his evening gave a clearer light Zechariah xiv. 7. Than the long earthly day had ever known; I sat by him one summer afternoon While he was sleeping—there is truth in Sleep, They say the tongue if questioned cannot choose But answer truly, even so the face In slumber answers truly to the soul; And upon his was now no trace of hardness, No more than on the earth of last year's snow; And even in his half-shut eye a kindness, And all about his mouth a look of peace; He slumbered lightly, and I heard the words Half murmured, “Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, O Lord, and on the Earth is none beside Thee; My heart and flesh are failing me, but God Is my Soul's portion, and my strength for ever.” And fearing to awake him, I sat down And stirred not from the window-seat that looked On the old pleasant garden that I loved; All in the house was quiet, for the rest Had gone out to the milking, nothing stirred— The old house-cat slept by me in the sunshine, And through the open window came the sound, The summer sound of bees among the flowers, With distant voices from the harvest field; I know not how it was, but on my spirit There fell a quietness so still and deep, A sadness that had such a sweetness in it, As I can find no language to express; There are such moments, when the air is full Of blessing, moments in our life when Heaven Seems nearer to us, and its lofty gates Set wider open; in that Sabbath moment, All that I loved were with me, William, George, and my little girl; I thought of all The things that had been, and my soul was filled With humble, hopeful, reconciling joy: Just then the door was opened, and looked in Our good old clergyman, my father's friend; He made a sign to me, and by the bed Sate silent till my father should awake. At last he stirred, and when he saw our friend He said, “You, Sir, alone? Where are they all? And where is Mary? seldom is it she Deserts her post,” he added, smiling kindly. I answered, “Father, I am here;” and then Knelt down beside the bed and took his hand, And kissed it over and again, and said, “Oh, Father, only say that you forgive us! For now I know that in your heart you have Forgiven us, then only tell us so! We feel as if your anger turned away God's face from us—Oh, father! then forgive us; It is the first time I have asked it of you Upon my knees, because you still denied me, But I have asked it of my Heavenly Father Upon my knees, for years, and something tells me That He has not refused me!” Then my father Was silent for awhile, but pressed my hand, And to his lip before he spoke there came A smile, that was itself a piece of Heaven; He said, “Oh, Mary! rightly art thou named, For thou art like thy namesake in the Bible, Thou hast loved much! be therefore unto thee The more forgiven, and when thou art, my daughter, As near thy end as now I draw to mine, Then may thy heavenly Father pardon thee All things that thou hast done through life to grieve him, As freely as I now forgive and bless thee.” But at his words I wept—“Oh, Father! William! You have not mentioned William's name! to me It is no blessing if he does not share it.” He smiled and answered, turning to our friend, “(Said I not well that she was rightly named?) But when I blessed thee, Mary, even in thought I did not put asunder those whom God Hath joined so close and kindly; go for William, Yes, go for my son William, that my soul May bless you both together ere I die:” I would have flown to fetch him then, but felt A hand upon my arm, that stopped me kindly; It was the good old clergyman—his eyes Were wet with tears, and yet he ever loved A cheerful word that had instruction in it; “When Mary was a little girl,” he said, Turning unto my father, “at the school I taught her all her ten commandments duly, And made her say them over and again Till I was sure she knew them perfectly. But God himself has taught her that Eleventh one, Our Blessed Master bade us learn by heart, And I am sure she knows it perfectly.” Now have you heard My story; it has been A long one: rather I have made it so, Loving to linger over it, for now Those that it tells of only live for me In thoughts by day, and dreams upon my bed; Now there is little more remains to tell. Trav. Except of how you came to leave old England, And settle in this lone and distant place. Mary. It was through William, Sir, that used to think (Being, unlike most other country people, Of an inquiring, active turn of mind) The New World was more roomy than the Old, And fairer prospects open to our children; And both are good, I know, for God made both; And we have prospered well in this, yet still, In part, I missed the things I left behind, Although I brought my chiefest treasure with me; At least I missed them when that too was gone,— It is now ten years since I buried William; Sometimes, when we were happiest, a gloom Would come across me, thinking of the time When one of us would have to leave the other; Such thoughts are suited to a life like ours;— What matter! since there is a world where Love Shall fill the soul, and never over-weigh it; In Heaven, Love walks for ever in the sun, Yet casts no shadow after him as here. When William died, I know not what it was, I felt,—a grief that was a thankfulness, For being blest with one like him so long;— And I am always cheerful as you see me, But since he went, my life has never seemed To me what it was then; my sons are thriving, And settled happily; I now may say, Thanks to the goodness that has followed me, Through my long life, I have no wish remaining As far as this world goes, or only one; And that is, if I could but see my brother, Or hear some tidings of him ere I die. I sometimes think that he is dead, but then He does not come with William in my dreams: He settled in the Indies, where he traded, And married there, and seemed a prosperous man; Then we had often letters; later on They spoke of change that was not for the better, And told us he had lost his wife and child; Now it is years since last we heard of him, And how things fare with him I guess in vain, But oft I picture him within my mind, Now old and failing as I am myself, With no one by to comfort him with talk (He that was kind and good to all the world) Of things that were, and better things that shall be; And then I think of all that I could do To cheer him if I were but near, until (It is an old woman's thought) I feel as if— Knew I but where to seek him—I could start That moment, and walk on until the shoes Wore off my feet, nor stop until I reached him. Trav. And when you met, perhaps you might not know him, He must be changed. Mary. He was not one to change, Yet years and troubles may have told upon him. Trav. They must have told a heavy tale, indeed, Since all this while you have not known me—Mary! (He holds out his arms to her.) Oh, my dear sister, I have found it hard To make myself awhile thus strange unto you, For I came here to seek you; you are now The only one I have,—the rest I love Are neither in the New World nor the Old, But in another, safer far, and happier; Yet I was restless wanting them, and thought I will go forth, if yet my sister lives, Or William, there is something left for me. But, when at first I saw you did not know me, A sudden fancy took my mind to try If still the heart you used to have of old Kept in its right place through a lifetime's changes, And kept a place for me,—but now I find That there, and by the hearth is room enough For the old stranger, as you thought him; now He will not leave you till you tire of him. . . . CHILDHOOD. Once in a garden bounded By many a lofty wall, Where quaint old sentinels, in stone, Kept watch and ward o'er all, But opening southwards, shaded By trees that swept the ground, And kept the turf unfaded And green, the summer round, There was a little lake, and there An island, and a boat That lay 'mid shining water-flags And lily-leaves afloat; Smooth as the swards around them clipt, Swept only by the wing Of gauzy dragon-fly, that dipt In many a mazy ring, Were those still waters; all unstirred The rose's leaf would lie, Blown there by summer winds; the bird Skim, lightly glancing by. This was the Haunt of childhood; Once there I seemed to grow Among the flowers, and with the fruits To change and ripen slow; I watched them through all changes, there Upon the grass I lay Snowed over by the blossoms light That fell so thick in May; I saw the currant strips that hung Transparent on the stems They clothed as in the Eastern tale With many coloured gems; I watched the peach's sunny cheek Turn slowly on the wall, And with no guess at Nature's laws Saw many an apple fall; Gold-tinted, rosy-tinged, their hues Were mine, and I as they; The purple bloom was on my life, The down unbrushed away; My world was then like His that first A happy garden knew, Unworn, and fresh, and glistening bright With shining spheres of dew; My soul was full of light that passed As through a tinctured pane In warm and vermeil hues, and cast On all its gorgeous stain; The dial on its grassy mound That silent marked the hours, (Time's footfall then awoke no sound, That only trod on flowers), The sun-flowers and the moon-flowers (These were lilies white and tall), The ancient griffins that looked down Upon me from the wall! These were for tokens unto me And signs, they seemed to pass Into my life as then I lay At noon-day on the grass, And twined a wondrous history Slow twisting, branch and stem, My garlands binding all the while My Being up with them; And I knew that in the wild-wood 'Mid the meadows, on the hill Were flowers, but unto childhood The best were nearest still; And I sometimes thought “out yonder I will seek for blossoms too,” But turned again the fonder To those that round me grew; Still have I flowers around me— But some that grow so high I cannot reach unto them, And they drop not till they die; Still I have flowers around me— But some that lie so low I cannot stoop to pluck them, They must wither where they grow; Still have I flowers to eye more fair, More dear unto the heart Than those, but scattered here and there They bloom, and far apart; I scarce know where to find them, I can never hope again Within one knot to bind them, As I did so often then. Soon told were childhood's treasures— The childish world was small, But its wonders and its pleasures Were its own—it held them all! Once, in a mansion, looking Upon that garden fair, Was a wide and pleasant parlour, And an eastward bedroom; there As on my little bed I lay Before my half-shut eyes Danced dreams of pleasure, that the morn Was sure to realize; When the sun knocked at my window, And to give him entrance free I sprung, because he never came Without some gift for me! Still night brings visions round my bed As sweet but not so true, And still the morning comes with gifts, But now they are not new; So I cry not now “To-morrow's come!” My spirit, less elate, For all that it may bring to me Full patiently can wait. My Evening and my Morning then Made up one perfect Day Of joy, and round the parlour fire My winter garden lay; I played beside it till I saw The deepening shadows fall, And through the twilight come and go The pictures on the wall, This was the hour for stories And wondrous tales, that drew My spirit after them to lands Where all was strange and new; And I listened, and I wondered, Then hastened to resume My journey (broken oft by falls That harmed not) round the room; I have now of longer journeys O'er rougher roads, to tell, And sorer hurts, without the kiss That used to make them well! This was the Home of childhood; As in a Fairy Ring Within the circle of its hearth Was drawn each cherished thing; I sent no restless thought beyond, I looked not to the door, If the whole world had entered there It could not give me more Than those that sat around it—all I knew of good and wise, Spoke for me then upon their lips, And lived within their eyes; I had no Future then, no Past, My life was unto me But one bright Now—the happiness That has no History! Still hath my heart a hearth, but now Its circle is so wide That those it burns for, never meet Around it side by side; They are severed, they are scattered, And now the twilight's fall Too often only comes to me With shadows on the wall; Soon filled with childhood's measure, The childish heart was small, Yet they that made its treasure Were its own—it held them all! Now is that hearth deserted, So warm and bright of yore, And that pleasant garden—through its paths I shall never wander more; It is closed to me as surely As if, to bar my way, The Flaming Sword before its gate Were turning night and day; Yet I would not therefore sever My spirit from the light, But strive to widen ever Its circle of delight; For all things from it taken, And all it seeks in vain, Together prest and shaken Shall fill it yet again; For each dim and shadowy token, Each hint to childhood given, Each promise Earth hath broken Shall yet be kept in Heaven, When joy and peace long-parted Meet in an endless kiss, And perfect Love is joined at last To pure and perfect bliss! For the great and gracious Giver, Till He spread both hands to bless The cup that ever floweth o'er, And never holdeth less, With the blessing without sorrow, With the long and perfect Day Of light, that hath no morrow To take its joy away, Lets not the heaped-up measure Within the bosom fall; Keeps back its richest treasure Until He gives it all! WINTER. Cold, cold! it is very cold Without the house; the year is old! His pulse is faint, and his blood runs slow, He lies, like a corpse, in his shroud of snow; It was drawn round his limbs by a noiseless sprite; He grew white with age in a single night. Wrap him up close, and cover him deep; Nothing is left for him now but to sleep! Sleep away! dream away! take no care, All day falls the snow through the darkened air; Fast, fast! for it knows, firm packed together, The clouds have laid stores in for wintry weather; Dark, dark! like a lazy slave, the sun Leaves his short half day's work all undone; But the night is clear, and the stars shine forth, And the fire-flags stream in the frosty north, And the glistening earth in the moon's pale ray, Looks fair with the smile of a softer day: Red breaks the morn, and the evening glows With the sea-shell's blush on the drifted snows, Rose-tinted pearl! while 'mid the glooms The flake-feathered trees show like giant plumes. No stir awakes in the death-like woods, In those still enchanted solitudes, Wreathed in all wild fantastic forms Are the tomb-like halls of the King of Storms, The streams are all chained, and their prisoned waves Sleep a charmèd sleep within crystal caves; No stir in the waters, no sound on the air,— Their inmates find shelter, they only know where; But cold is the comfort they own at the best, When the icicle hangs where the swallow found rest, And a few of Earth's wise things when summer was gay, Laid by something safe for a Winterly day; But the wisest among them have taken a sleep, Snug coiled up, and warm, while the snow lies so deep, Where the keen frost may bite, yet can do them no harm, As they dream of the summer and all that is warm: No breath in the valley, no breeze on the hill, No stir in the farm, all is dull, all is chill; And the cattle lie huddled within the fold,— Cold, cold! it is very cold. Warm, warm! it is so warm Within the Heart, that all is warm! The Heart knows a secret to keep out the chill, Let it come when it likes, and stay as it will, For, the keener it blows, and the deeper it snows, The higher the pure flame of charity glows! When earth grows unkind to her children, nor cares How soon they may sink to that cold breast of hers; Though she know not pity, love will not withhold; There are those who have hunger to bear with the cold; There are homes that are no homes! no work and no wage, No sunshine for childhood, no comfort for age, No food and no fire; but sickness, with care And poverty, dreary companions! are there. Oh! sweet to sit around the board That Providence hath blessed,— And sweet to draw the curtain round our warm and sheltered rest; To see the faces at whose smile the household hearth grows bright, And to feel that, 'mid the darkness, in our dwellings there is light! If we have done what love might do, and wished that it were more, To keep the grim wolf yet awhile without the poor man's door; And if our day hath not gone down, without its kind relief To some of those its sad dawn woke to misery and grief, We need not fear the frost and cold; we have found out a charm, To keep our House, and Home, and Heart, and all our Being warm! Kind Christmas comes with all its gifts, and absent friends seem near, And the Christian hails earth's darkest day for the brightest in his year; And there is peace, and there is joy, and there are anthems sung, As once by angels in the air, when Christmas-time was young;— And our hearts learn the tones of that happy psalm. Warm, warm! it is very warm! THE DEFORMED CHILD. When Summer days are long and warm, they set my little chair Without the door, and in the sun they leave me sitting there; Then many thoughts come to my mind, that others never know, About myself, and what I feel, and what was long ago. There are no less than six of us, and all of them are tall And stout as any you may see, but I was always small: The neighbours look at me and say, I grow not with the rest; Then Father strokes my head and says, The least are sometimes best. But hearing I was not like them, within my head one day It came (strange thoughts that children have!) that I'd been changed away! And then I cried—but soon the thought brought comfort to my mind, If I were not their own, I knew they could not be so kind. For we are happy in our home as ever people were, Yet sometimes Father looks as if his heart was full of care: When things go wrong about the house, then Mother vexed will be; But neither of them ever spoke a cross word unto me. And once, when all was dark, they came to kiss me in my bed, And though they thought I slept quite sound, I heard each word they said. “Poor little thing! to make thee well, we'd freely give our all; But God knows best!” and on my cheek I felt a warm tear fall. And then I longed to sit upright, and tell them not to fret, For that my pains were not so bad, I should be stronger yet; But as the words came to my lips, they seemed to die away, And then they drew the curtain close, and left me as I lay. And so I did not speak at all, and yet my heart was full, And now, when I am sick and ill, for fear it makes them dull To see my face so pale and worn, I creep to Father's side, And press it close against his own, and try the pain to hide Then upon pleasant Sundays in the long warm evening hours, Will Father take me in his arms among the fields and flowers; And he'll be just as pleased himself to see the joy I'm in, And Mother smiles and says she thinks I look not quite so thin. But it is best within the house when nights are long and dark, And two of brothers run from school, and two come in from work; And they are all so kind to me, the first word they will say To Mother at the door will be, “Has Bess been well to-day?” And though I love them all so well, one may be loved the best, And brother John, I scarce know why, seems dearer than the rest; But tired and cross as I may feel, when he comes in at night And takes me on his knee and chats—then everything is right! When once, I know, about some work he went quite far away, Oh! how I wished him back again, and counted every day; And when, the first of all, I heard his foot upon the stair, Just for that once I longed to run and leave my little chair! Then when I look at other girls they never seem to be So pretty as our Hannah is, or half so neat as she; But she will soon be leaving us, to settle far away With one she loves, and who has loved her well this many a day. I sometimes think because I have few pleasures, and no cares, Wherewith to please or vex myself, they like to tell me theirs; For sister talks to me for hours, and tells me much that she Would never breathe unto a soul unless it were to me. One night, when we were quite alone, she gave the fire a stir, And shut the door, and showed the ring that William bought for her, And told me all about her house, and often she has said, That I shall come to live with them, when she and William wed. But that I think will scarcely be, for when our Hannah goes, What we shall do for want of her, not one among us knows; And though there is not much in me, the place she leaves to fill; Yet something may be always done, where there is but the will. Then the kind doctor says, and he is very seldom wrong, That I some day, when no one thinks, may grow both stout and strong; And should I be, through all my life, a care unto my friends; Yet Father says, there are worse cares than God Almighty sends! And I will think of this, and then I never can feel dull, But pray to God to make me good, and kind, and dutiful; And when I think on Him that died, it makes my heart grow light, To know that feeble things on earth are precious in His sight! THE DAUGHTER OF THE HALL. A STORY OF EVERY DAY. “Where I was wont to meet her, My true love to my call, Came glimmering through the laurels at quiet even-fall, In the garden, by the turrets of the old manorial hall.” It was at church, one summer morn, my good, my dear old wife, That first I saw the face that made the sunshine of my life; Your look still dwelt upon your book, I do not think you knew The stolen glances that were cast towards the squire's pew! Seven blooming Daughters then were there, and one a fair young bride, And at the head the mother sat and looked adown with pride; And well she might! when it was said and sung by great and small, How sweet a family were they, the ladies at the Hall! But from her lofty place of pride, could that high dame have guessed The thought that woke, ah, woe betide! in one poor scholar's breast; That I should dare to look at you! yes, it was boldly done, The Daughter of the wealthy squire! the vicar's youngest son! The next time that I saw your face was at the county ball, There with our County member's son you led off first of all; Low in the country dance I stood, yet to my ears since then, There has been music in the sound of “cross hands, back again!” Yes, you were fair! your sunny hair, I think I see it now, Rolled back in many a shining curl high from your open brow; No step so light, no smile so bright, as yours within the ball, Yet with an air that might declare, the lady of the Hall. And I went home to dream that night of many a splendid scene, But through them all, one form, one face shone forth, my fancy's Queen; Of high-born maids and lowly squires,—and woke from slumber's thrall, To see the dawning gild with light the turrets of the Hall. Ah! now, I thought, perhaps she wakes, but not from dreams of me, My homage can be nought to her, unknown then let it be; Unknown! uncared for! but just then, Hope stole so slily in, And something whispered that faint heart might ne'er fair lady win; And then I wrote! how many times, in days that are long past, Have you and I laughed o'er those rhymes, my first but not my last; For in your father's stately woods does many a tree declare, (If Time hath spared the letters yet) that Emma's smile was fair; Then term-time came, and with it brought some academic bays, Ah! dear to youthful scholar's heart, the hard-won meed of praise! The county paper will not fail, I thought, to tell her all, Yes, surely they will speak of me, this morning at the Hall! Then Fancy flew on burnished wing an aërial race with Time, O'er many a strange and brilliant land, through many a glowing clime; Then like a bright and wandering bird, that answered to my call Would fold its soft and gleaming plumes upon the ancient Hall. Old Time wore on; there dawned a day that brought me to your feet, Oft have we lived it o'er since then, and still the theme is sweet! Your sisters sighed, “True love was all, with or without a purse,” And once for all your brother said, that Emma might do worse. The good old Squire; I see him yet! the squire of days bygone, Who had a laugh for every jest, the loudest for his own, “My seven fair daughters! shall I find a lord apiece for all? A worthy youth, our vicar's son, and welcome at the Hall!” Your Lady-mother smoothed her brow, and smiled her stately smile And made some show of courtesy to mine within the aisle, Yet wore throughout a dignified and somewhat frigid mien, And did not take me to her heart until I was a Dean. Full fifty years since then have wrought their web of good and ill, But only seem in heart and thought to bind us closer still! “Time changes all,” the saying goes, but we can surely prove, That his cold breath may pass in vain o'er evergreens like Love. I wonder, when in idler hours I read of sylvan shades, And noble youths who sought for truth with simple village maids, If I had found a gentler wife, a truer 'mong them all, Than SHE who somewhat stooped to me, the Daughter of the Hall! THE LOVER'S QUARREL. Light is the Lover's quarrel, men say — I think not so, It is the hand we love the best that deals the hardest blow, And the wounds that come from it the heart is still too proud to show, So closes over them; too proud? Nay! Pride is not so strong As that which fain a hurt would hide although it rankle long, From soothing that would only chafe, and pity that would wrong; For Anger born of Love, although like sweetest things that turn The bitterest of all, it seem each soft'ning thought to spurn, Yet owns the country whence it came, and after it will yearn,— And something there is still that brooks no word or thought unkind, And seeks amid its very pain some fond excuse to find, For what was dear, and may not all at once be cast behind; I speak of what I know full well, for thus it chanced of yore, (I know not now where blame should rest so lay it at the door Of Love, that having given so much, will still exact the more.) With me and Her I love—one Eve our parting was in scorn, Oh! dimly, sadly broke the next and many an afterdawn, With sense of something gone from me, and evermore withdrawn; For Sunrise used within my heart to wake a matin chime Of bells, that rung me to a strife untold as yet in rhyme, Though fierce as Dragon-Fight of old—the Lover's against Time! Like Errant Knight I pressed him sore and found him hard to kill, Yet strove with action and emprise to gain upon him still, And with some task of nobleness each lingering pause to fill Between the hours we used to meet; but now with even flow His sands might run, I would not try to shake them to and fro, And his great Chariot-wheels for me might move on swift or slow, For all the days that used to shine in characters of light Upon the Kalends of my life marked out in red and white, Had faded, when their Saint no more would bless her Votary's sight; And so I thought I will away, nor linger here alone, To vex my heart out, like a ghost that makes an idle moan About the place where joy was once and is for ever flown; Better to see her never more, than meet as now we meet, Yet will I see her once again, I said; and strove to cheat, To sternness and to pride my heart that told me it was sweet To meet her even thus; I thought, some crowded scene were best, Less room for feelings there to rise that have to be repressed; There she may pass me if she will as one among the rest, And less be there to bring again the thought of things gone by, And easier for me to bear her changed, averted eye, And to cold words of courtesy make fitting, due reply. Small heart had I for revels then, and little graced, I trow, The one I went to as I stood with dark, abstracted brow And folded arms,—I see it all distinct before me now, The gay and lighted room, the crowd of smiling faces there, I smiled (for quickly learnt the stern moralities of Care;) “It only is that they than I the mask more closely wear.” Was she among the maskers then?—that came into the room With frank sweet smile, and cheek that blushed in beauty's conscious bloom; I wrapt my spirit at the sight in deeper, thicker gloom, And to my brain the endless strain more dull and vexing grew, The dance swept onwards—it were well to play the pageant through; I thought, and with a listless step its maze I threaded too, And knew not she was nigh until my ear her accents met, “You leave us then so soon? Farewell!” and softer, lower yet In tones that none beside might hear, “Forgive, but don't forget.” I looked up at her words and met an eye whose gentle ray Sunk timid 'neath my anxious gaze, yet was not turned away, And the smile that used to be of old, as kind, but not so gay; The ice about my heart gave way, and with a generous shame, I answered quick, “Forgive? nay! now too much from me you claim, For hard I find it to forgive the only one to blame,” “Unless your kindness intercede, and plead for him awhile, You that alone in all the world can soothe and reconcile My wayward spirit with itself,”—she answered by a smile. THE OLD FAMILY. Not now is given, as of old, unto the free of hand, And to the liberal of soul, the fulness of the land; Or They would have been with us still, our hearts and homes among, The good old family, that held by hill and stream so long. The oldest tales among us told, the oldest song e'er sung, Could bring no trace of times when that our goodly tree was young; They lived among us, sire and son, among us when they died, We laid them where their Fathers lie, each resting side by side. They were so much our own, that still their pleasure was our pride, When a child was born unto the house, or the heir brought home his bride; We owned a part in all they had—it seemed that we went shares In Life, when we partook their joys, and half forgot our cares! Oh! when shall we e'er see the like of them we loved, again? Where meet such kindly hearts to feel for all the poor man's pain? When in his hour of gladness now shall those kind tones be heard, To make it double with the smile that sweetened every word? A word from them, a smile, a look, oh! it was sweeter far Than all the gifts that others give, than all their favours are; Yet they were bountiful and free as any that may live, But with their gifts the blessing came, that money cannot give. How oft it comes within my mind, the morning of the day, When we took our leave of them—the last, before they went away: The beating hearts, the trembling hands, the tongues that strove to tell Our gratitude and love to them, who knew it all so well. There was no child but owned their care, no aged soul and poor, But blessed their shadow, as it fell within the humble door; No bed of sickness, where their words of comfort did not wake; May He who saw their love to us their bed in sickness make! May He be with them in their ways, wherever they may go, And give to them the Heritage the faithful only know; And they have wealth, that will abide when earthly goods depart, In the poor man's love, the poor man's prayer, and the blessing of his heart! How sad it seemed to miss their words of greeting on our ways, How heavily our work went on without their cheering praise; We felt like those who lose on earth their refuge and their stay, When They, the family we loved, went from us far away. They left with us their treasure—yes, we hold what they held dear, The father, our good father, laid for ever with us here; Not in his day the change came o'er the scenes he loved the best, He sleeps, nor dreams of what is now, safe gathered to his rest. The noble-hearted gentleman, who house and hand and heart So open held, that in his own he only claimed a part; He bore his state unto the last, the snows of winter fell, A mirthful man was he! the snows of age Fell on him, but they chilled not. —Scott. But might not chill the true-born soul that loved us all so well! How sad it seemed to us to see the velvet lawn unmown, Weeds springing in the garden that our Lady called her own! The pleasant lake choked up and dry, and swamped the little boat That bore the children in their glee so merrily afloat. Our fine young gentlemen, no more when Autumn days grow dark, We hear their loud and cheerful tones come ringing through the park; Their dogs find other masters now, it seemed to do us wrong That aught that they had liked so well to others should belong. And strangers now live at the Hall, oh! sad to us and strange It seems, to see their places filled, when hearts have known no change; Strange voices sounding in our ears, strange faces in the pew, When Sunday found the fairest ones, the dearest that we knew. Yet it were evil to complain, the new may be the kind, But can they be to us like Them—to whom each heart and mind Was like a book before them spread, where they might read at will, And 'mid our errors trace their names, the loved and honoured still. We feel it still, though from us gone, the smile that was our praise, The eye that mourned to see our steps withdraw from virtue's ways; The patient words, the gentle deeds, that strove to lead us on In paths of pleasantness and peace, they have not surely gone! We think of Them, that if they come once more to the old place, Our looks may answer theirs, nor fear to meet them face to face; For the land, the land is still their own, and they may come once more, To flourish where the ancient stock was wont to thrive of yore. We think of them when Spring sends forth the bud upon the bough, And wish that They could see how well the young woods promise now; When Autumn brings the harvest round, we wish that They could see How well the reapers do their work upon the upland lea. Oh! things have changed with us, with all, since last they went away, And youthful brows are marked with care, and hair is mixed with grey; And They will look on many a change, on children grown to men, But the heart,—the heart will be the same to welcome them again! “REJOICE EVERMORE.” Gen. I. 31. A Spirit rests upon our Earth, abiding, though unseen Its soft and gleaming wing may be, we know where it hath been, We hear no sound of rushing plumes, yet feel them where they pass, O'er waving boughs and bursting buds, and light up-springing grass. And we discern in Earth and sky, in all familiar things, A sense, a subtle influence, we know not whence it springs! A gentle presence looks on us with pure and loving face, A mother yearns to fold her sons within a kind embrace. Oh! she is bountiful and rich in costly things and rare, But her sweetest, dearest blessings spring like lilies without care, The sun that shines o'er good and ill, the gentle rains that fall, These are but types of what she gives—a heritage for all. The glory of the silent eve, when all is hushed and still, And golden sunset splendours stream o'er valley and on hill, When broad and deep the shadows fall, and o'er the pearly sky In glory Earth may never match, the clouds go sailing by. Or when the flush of morning breaks in hues undreamt, untold, And light dawns clear upon the world through shrouding mists of gold; These are her pageantries in which each living soul bears part, Her gorgeous shows for every eye, her lessons for each heart. Where shielded for the eye of wealth exotic beauty glows, The chaste Camellia unfolds her pure, unsullied snows, The bright Geranium shines there in rich and crimson pride, And waxen Orange-blossoms hoard their sweetness for the bride. But in the paths we daily tread, and in the poor man's way, The flow'rets lie, whose looks, whose names, are far more sweet than they; The Primrose gem-like, 'mid its leaves, and she whose heaven blue eye Repeats the lesson it hath learnt from the pure changeless sky! There clustering like wreathèd pearls, like ocean's foam-white spray, It blooms for every hand and eye, the almond-scented May; Fragrant and wild 'mid bosky dells the faint, pale Woodbines wreathe, And shed their store of honey-dews for all that live and breathe. A palm-like coronet, the Fern waves green 'neath hedge-rows lone, The Cherry gleams within the woods, the Chestnut rears its cone; The Furze breaks like an odorous flame o'er waste and upland wold, And o'er each silent, ruined place the Wall-flower scatters gold. And many a humble garden owns the flowers we love the best, Whose aspects weave a gentle spell by every heart confest; Where glowing Pink and queen-like Rose in burning colours vie, And the pale-blossomed Lilac breathes a summer on its sigh. Within the palaces of wealth the song and dance are found, The Viol and the Harp are there, the Lute with silver sound; But Summer sends upon the air a yet more pleasant tune, The slow, sweet murmurs of the bee, the melodies of June; Dim forest-rustlings light and low, the waters lulling fall, The songs of birds, the Ring-dove's plaint, more sad, more sweet than all; In one deep hymn the mighty winds, the chiming billows blend, And in a ceaseless harmony unto their Lord ascend. Yet there are sweeter sounds than these!—the music of the heart That breathes through greetings and farewells when kindred meet and part; Kind voices loved in olden days, that bear upon their tone A message from the happy Past and all that it hath known. Oh! dim must be the deadened eye, and dull the pining thought, That owns not in all things that be, a power with blessing fraught; The Mother-love Chacun en a sa part, et tous l'ont tout entier!”Victor Hugo. that waits around with fond untiring care Where each has all! abounding more, the more her children share. A single taper homeward guides the poor man's toilworn way, A thousand turn the rich man's night to soft and lustrous day; But light more blessed shines alike on cottage and on hall, Kind smiles are there, and pleasant words, and the dear, dear love for all! BALLAD. “Do you think of the days that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye wish that the Morn might bring back the time, When your heart and your step were light?” “I think of the days that are gone, Robin, And all that I joyed in them, But the fairest that ever arose on me I have never wished back again.” “Do you think of the hopes that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye reckon them o'er, as they faded fast, Like buds in an early blight?” “I think of the hopes that are gone, Robin, But I mourn not their stay was fleet, For they fell as the leaves of the red Rose fall, That even in fading are sweet.” “Do ye think of the friends that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye wish they were round you again once more, By the hearth that they made so bright?” “I think of the friends that are gone, Robin, They are dear to my heart as then, But the best and the dearest among them all, I have never wished back again!” THE IRISH EMIGRANT'S SONG. FOR MUSIC. Alone—amid the darkening woods I hear them lightly pass, And in the twilight little feet come stealing o'er the grass; Kind voices rise when all is still, and call me by my name, And pleasant faces look on me from out the Pine wood flame: Oh! my Brothers and my Sisters, how I miss you here alone! Oh, Father and my Mother dear, do you think upon your own? Who prays for you each night and morn The burden of this song is that of a very ancient Irish ditty.—See Lockhart's Life of Scott.—Och hone! Och hone! Thinking on the days that are long enough agone! I sit beside the mighty stream that rolls down like a sea, And think upon the Burn-side where my true love sat by me! Where we said our sad and parting words the evening of the day, The last I spent with them I loved before I came away; Where my little Kathleen sat by me, her hand within my own, And wept to think that I should go so far away alone; It seems to me I see her still—Och hone! Och hone! Thinking of the days that are long enough agone! No more the thousand welcomes send their music to my heart, No more the kind “Heaven prosper ye!” when kindred meet and part; Amid the trackless forest-wilds a lonely man I stray, Where never word of greeting comes to cheer me on my way; Far from the looks I love the best, from each familiar tone, Here must I live and labour on, alone—alone! Yet I work, I work and pray for them—Och hone! Och hone! Thinking on the days that are long enough agone! SONGS OF FAREWELL. PARTING. “They that my trust must grow to, dwell not here, They are with all my other comforts, Far hence.” Oh! speak of me, my friends! when I am gone Bind with my name some old familiar strain, That it may bear a greeting on its tone From One, heart-woven with its linkèd chain. For I will speak of you! your names will rise When the full heart would of its treasure tell, And I will seek in stranger looks and eyes To trace the aspects I have loved so well. Oh! think of me, my friends! when I am gone Let not my memory lightly pass away, With pleasant songs forgotten—or as one A stranger-guest, abiding but a day. For I will think of you! a purer ray Will gild Life's journey, flung from times of old, And Thought will reckon o'er, when far away, Their gentle memories—its hoarded gold. Oh! dream of me, my friends! when I am gone, Then be your happy slumbers lightly stirred By tender shadows from the distance thrown, By echoes sweet of some remembered word. For on my visions haunting forms will rise, And I will seek in sleep a clasping hand, And I shall look within those much-loved eyes, Once more, within the pleasant dreaming-land! Oh! pray for me, my friends! when I am gone Still with your voices let my name arise, Where once my accents mingled in the tone Of your sweet hymns and twilight harmonies. For I will pray for you! my spirit lone Will seek the language that its kindred share; Yes! there, beloved friends! when I am gone It will be mine, dear friends, to meet you there! DEATH. “Leaves and clustered fruits, and flowers eterne, Eternal to the world, but not to me.” —Hood. The Spring will come again, dear friends, The Swallow o'er the Sea; The bud will hang upon the bough, The blossom on the tree; And many a pleasant sound will rise to greet her on her way, The voice of bird, and leaf, and stream, and warm winds in their play; Oh! sweet the airs that round her breathe! and bountiful is she, She bringeth all the things that fresh, and sweet, and hopeful be; She scatters promise on the Earth with open hand and free, But not for me, my friends, But not for me! Summer will come again, dear friends, Low murmurs of the Bee Will rise through the long sunny day Above the flowery lea; The deep and dreamy woods will own the slumbrous spell she weaves, And send a greeting, mixed with sighs, through all their quivering leaves. Oh, precious are her glowing gifts! and plenteous is she, She bringeth all the lovely things that bright and fragrant be; She scatters fulness on the Earth with lavish hand and free, But not for me, my friends, But not for me! Autumn will come again, dear friends, His spirit-touch will be With gold upon the harvest-field, With crimson on the tree; He passeth o'er the silent woods, they wither at his breath, Slow fading in a still decay, a change that is not Death. Oh! rich, and liberal, and wise, and provident is he! He taketh to his Garner-house the things that ripened be; He gathereth his store from Earth, all silently— And he will gather me, my friends, He will gather me!</field>
