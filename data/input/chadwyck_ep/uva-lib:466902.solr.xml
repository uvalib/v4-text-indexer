      <field name="fulltext">THE DREAM OF A POET'S YOUTH. Founded on the Romance of “The Improvisatore,” by H. C. Andersen. “S'è fermáto il cor che tanto balzó.”— Yes! I am old! no more may ye awaken Deep answering chords that to the future thrill'd When life was young! Time's measured sands are shaken, Hope's pulse runs slow, its eager throbbings still'd, To own the calm of Destinies fulfilled. Thy teachings, Life! have many been, and stern; The heart of age hath gentler lore to learn. With the long day-light we have toiled and striven; Now on our way the length'ning shadow lies And Peace comes down, an angel guest at even, Through the deep quiet of the darkling skies— On Twilight's hush long-silent tones arise, And solemn voices through the stillness call, As soft around the dews of Memory fall. Hard would it seem that I should breathe anew The troubled air of many an earlier day; Sore task, again to play the pageant through, And brace these wearied sinews to the fray; Yet sweet to Thought is what hath past away! As, lighted up by spiritual gleams, The Past returns—with all its vanished dreams. For in my eager and adventurous youth I thought it joy to wrestle with strong waves, Deep diving for the hidden pearls of Truth In Thought's gem-lighted caves; Now, while afar the foaming breaker raves, I stand upon a furrowed shore alone, And hear the hollow tide's receding moan Fast ebbing from me! yet may not repine, To have no argosies upon that sea, Nor sigh to call its golden ventures mine, And feel its breezes promise fair for me. It is enough, the blest security That Thou, oh troubled and perturbed deep, Hast now no store of garnered hopes to keep! Yet once my ardent spirit sought not rest, Nor joyed in calm! amid the ocean's foam It built, like fabled birds of old, a nest, And found upon the fickle waves a home; O'er the wild waste of waters Thought would roam, A dove that sought not yet to fold its wing, But tokens brought of many a glorious thing. And oft those soft and many coloured plumes Would rest amid bright islets of that sea, Upon whose rich and summer-breathing blooms Abode the changeful light of phantasy. O Life and Hope, what were ye then to me! Still through the gathering mists of after years, Your visions shine, undimmed by time or tears. It seems to me my Youth was not the same That others know; the world was unto me The Gate of Heaven, where constant went and came Angelic forms no other eye might see; Mine was the gift, O sun-bright Italy, Thy children know! that o'er all real things A gleam, a glory, from the spirit flings. And yet, fair land, thy calm and dream-like smile Needs not the deep'ning glow from Fancy caught; Soft breathe thy airs, and lovingly the while Broods over all the changeless spell of Thought; The shadow of a Past, with grandeur fraught, Rests, like a solemn charm, on grove and hill, And round thy silent shrines the presence still Of Greatness lingers! although Power hath fled. A child, I dwelt within that Field of Tombs The Campagna of Rome. Where o'er the sleep of her majestic Dead, Kind Nature flings a veil of living blooms; Slowly, amid those solitary glooms Glides o'er its sultry course the yellow wave, That lifts a mournful voice round Glory's grave. The giant sepulchre of old Renown! Whose dust is eloquent of Might gone by, Whose stones are histories; where Ruin shares her crown, And shadow-peopled court, with Memory, That still mid desolation silently Reclaims her portion from the spoiler's sway, Queen of a realm that owneth not decay! Thus wondrous forms were round me, and my eyes Robed them in hues of more consummate glow, Soul-steeped in beauty! on those gorgeous skies My youth traced prophecies, and voices low Sang to my heart! then to my lips would flow, Like echoes soft that had been slumbering long, Of strains familiar once, the unsought song; And with the glad free impulse of the bird That knows not whence its thrilling strain is caught, My soul within itself was shook and stirred With a wild gush of melody, untaught, Unfettered! in its kindling utterance fraught With power a Being and a Breath to give Unto Thought's imaged forms, and bid them live! And oh! how beautiful the inner World Wherein my Spirit moved—how strange and bright! Like a rich Banner in its pride unfurled Inwrought with threads of interwoven light, And gleaming traceries, before my sight It waved! unfolding from its brilliant maze All hues of ecstasy unto my gaze! Yet to the spirit of a stronger spell My youth was vowed; though then I did not deem The heart's deep founts of music might not swell To the soft touch, that once with morning's beam Drew from the fabled stone its prisoned stream Of melody! more rude, more stern, the shock That calls the living waters from the rock! But how this shock, this change, upon me fell, And how, within a time whose breath was Pain, My Heart's Youth died, avails not now to tell; For all have loved, and some have loved in vain; All have known visions, some have wak'd again To say, “It was a dream,” and stand forlorn In the grey breaking of a cheerless Dawn! Thus, in a dis-enchanted world, alone I stood, and felt the heart's sad solitude; For they I dwelt among were not my own, And theirs the kindness of the strange in blood, That will give all but tenderness! its mood Too wise for sympathy, too cold to guess That all is wanting with its gentleness. Yet were they kind! though it was mine to prove How to the generous nature there is pain In Gratitude that may not merge in Love, How the heart withers 'neath the icy chain Of gifts its wealth may not pay back again— For mine was rich! and only yearned to pour On some kind breast the fulness of its store. But they had need of nought that I could give; Yet still, when wounded by their teaching tone, Within its bonds my fettered soul would strive; Quick rose the thought, “they took me for their own, “When I was desolate, obscure—alone “Within a world where none were left to care “How in its wilderness my youth might fare.” Thus, in their princely halls I dwelt as one Who may not cancel, while he owns, a debt; My childhood's friend—my Mother, she was gone; While it was noon, my Youth's bright sun had set; My vision'd fancies, they were all! e'en yet I joy to feel those morning dreams brought truth, To know that manhood kept its faith with youth! But living thus, my ardent being yearned, And seeking what it found not, inly pined: And Pride, that met no softer thought returned, Grew to a dull estrangement from my kind, Being alone too much in heart and mind: But God gives Love! some gentle hand will fling The healing bough in life's embittered spring! There was a daughter of that noble race, Vowed from her birth unto the cloister's shade, Whose infancy had found a cherished place Within my heart; then had she often played Beside me, and in childish utterance prayed That I should draw her pictures, and once more Repeat the tales so often told before. And when I wandered forth, she said to me, “Wilt thou not weep, to go so far away, And leave us all? oft shall I think of thee, And weep, Antonio!—for many a day Will I look for thee, where we used to play!” Then my tears gush'd, as from a fount set free, I wept, sweet little one, to part with thee! And now she came once more among her own, For a brief space, ere yet the word was said Which took her from a world she had not known, And numbered her, in life, among the dead!— Heaven's chosen Bride, she came, as yet unwed To gaze with wondering smile around, nor grieve To see how fair was all that she must leave. But as the bird whose song hath cheered the north With the glad voice of summer! from its home When comes the storm-cloud, flies unbidden forth, Lured by a hidden instinct o'er the foam, And finds a brilliant world wherein to roam, Yet stirred by vague unrest abides not there, Lighting on nought familiar, though so fair; Thus through those splendid scenes she moved alone, As one content an alien part to take For a brief while; and as the arrowy Rhone, Pure, from the hills whence its blue waters break, Flows on swift current through the turbid lake, Yet mingles not! so She amid that throng Held on her course, not of them, though among! That thus in Innocence she dwelt apart From us and from our thoughts, made her more dear; Not yet so alien to Good, the heart,— Its spring of nobler impulse yet so sere, In this world's children, but it will revere Pure things and holy! “And felt how awful goodness is, and knew Virtue in her shape how lovely.” even while we gaze And wonder, heaven hath rested on our ways. Where'er her angel-eyes awhile might dwell It seemed as there all evil influence died; Heart-witheréd, as through some holy spell, The dream of worldliness, the thought of pride,— No longer might Earth's strong ones armed abide In peace within; at sight of one whose Youth Dwelt with the spirit and the power of truth! Thus was She strong in guilelessness, those eyes Had lightnings for the cause of the oppressed, A lambent flame, as through soft summer skies Would flash unbidden! quick that gentle breast Would heave! then sink with the calm scorn represt Of one whose glance, soul-strengthened apprehends Life's trivial game, low motives to low ends. And She was dear to all! how dear to me, How kind, how gentle, words might ill express; Her heart divined a painful mystery, And soothed with soft unspoken tenderness That pride in mine awoke not to repress; For unto Her its troubled gifts my mind Could pour, nor dread the cold repulse to find. And as the wanderer, on unfriendly seas Long voyaging, with spirit-gladness hails From spicy isles the soft and scented breeze, Well pleased to linger slow, with slack'ning sails Fanned by the breathings of those balm-fraught gales, Feels heart and fancy freshen, and the foam Give back the fair, the long-lost smile of home! My wearied sense thus caught a second spring From that fresh nature, and the early flowers That the world's breath had left a-withering, Owned a glad spell, as of awakening showers! She touched the master chord, and called forth powers Too long enchained; no discords might arise To mar those soft returning harmonies. Oft would we speak together of the world; Bright seemed it unto Her and sadly fair, As one who sees a gorgeous scene unfurled High 'mid the misty hills, in upper air Flung, like a spiritual shadow there— Feels a strange rapture shed soft influence, O'er the delighted but undazzled sense. Thus child-like Wonder dwelt within those eyes, Charmed with the vision in its fading hue; They would meet mine in questioning surprize, As eager from long-buried hours I drew The radiant shades their vanish'd memories threw. “How beautiful is life! God's earth how fair!” She said; yet sighed not for her portion there. For still the cloister lay around her heart,— Yet wistfully upon my words she hung; With mild entreaty that for once apart For Her those wondrous portals might be flung, That closed on outward things while life was young, She still would plead; ah! ever dearly bought, The gift of knowledge woke the troubled thought! And as these lips, long silent, did unfold The broken tale of what was long ago, How the heart's pictures faded, and the gold Of Hope grew dim! “And was it even so With Thee,” she sadly said, “Antonio?” I saw her weep; and comfort with those tears Shed healing on the bitterness of years, And as a shadow lingeréd, the while She mused upon my troubled history; She strove with Fate my mind to reconcile, And make my spirit one with Destiny! She spoke of Truth that might ungentle be Or seem; of Love that did appear Cold to the ardent, but was yet sincere. Then of my gift she spoke; the Poet's dower Of Song that seemed to her an earnest lent Of heavenly rapture, yielding earth a power To hymn God's praise in Thought's clear firmament Where it should soar, nor stoop to vain lament Oe'r mortal grief; but jubilant arise To join the adoring homage of the skies, “Let not Earth mar Heaven's music! on their course Let Song's bright waves,” she said, “untroubled flow! Oh! blessed they that to their primal source May trace the happy streams that here below Shed life and freshness; blest in joy or woe, To hearken to their tones! to stand and wait With inner spirit vowed and consecrate.” And Truth spoke with Her! yet she augured not How should she pierce the troubled mystery?— The vague desire, the fever of our lot, The yearning for a fuller sympathy That will seek utterance although to die; The grief, the passion, the unkindly strife, Through which Song struggles to imperfect life. Most vain it were to judge us by the test To which her own pure nature might respond, E'en now my soul a rising pang confest Of keen regret, all unavailing, fond, Whene'er it cast a shrinking glance beyond The Hour's bright charm, and marked it fleeting fast Into the dull and unreturning Past. And day by day more cold around my heart, Close folded as a wreathed serpent, lay The bitter consciousness that I must part For ever with the gentle star whose ray Had risen thus, so soft upon my way, To sink and leave me, its pure gleam withdrawn, Yet more alone! more desolate! forlorn! And in my fevered breast awoke a strife Tumultuous, as one who in a wood Hears on the Twilight, rise to fearful life, Wild spirit voices through the solitude; And be their import evil or for good Knows not, bewildered! vainly reason strove Against that passion of my Grief and Love. And was it Love that thus within my breast Woke the wild struggle, placing Heart and Mind In such fierce conflict, robbing each of rest, Where neither might the woful Victory find? Might this be Love for her, the pure and kind? I know not now! I sought not then to know! Nor strove to pierce the secret of my woe. It was enough that still I had to bear The anguish that my lip might never tell— But once! oh! but for once the veil to tear That wrapt me close, to bid life's harp-notes swell Their chords of passion in a last farewell; But once their full deep melody to wake The brooding silence of the soul to break! It might not be! around me was a chain— The lips were silent! silent, though the heart Beat with wild music in a broken strain That rose and sank above its ceaseless smart, As time drew on the hour that I must part, With all, Flaminia, in losing thee! My Being fading to a Memory. Yet can my spirit summon from the Past, Each word, each look, each hidden feeling trace Of that Farewell! yet was it not the last! Once more I looked upon that young, fair face, Serenely shining in its virgin grace, As cold and statue-like upon the bier She rested, with the smile that angels wear. Then every ornament was flung aside, The world had lent, e'en charms that God had given,— Bright gem and clustering curl! She stood the Bride Elect and spirit-sanctified of heaven; Each tie that bound her to her kind was riven For ever! e'en her much loved name was chang'd; From each familiar memory estranged! But on the evening ere she went away, How innocently gay she was and mild; She seemed once more in her endearing play, The child I loved in youth—the happy child! And, as of coming change unconscious, smiled, As if to cheat our thought that still would brood Upon that change with fond solicitude. Until the moment came that she must take Her parents' parting blessing; then her frame Was troubled as that long adieu did break;— My lips essayed to move, but no sound came; Once more she spoke! I heard her breathe my name, “May'st thou be happy, kind Antonio! Farewell dear brother!” tenderly and low. And it is said—Farewell! the word is spoken By lips that tremble o'er its passing sound; And with its tones, the spirit-music broken, Whose subtle harmonies perchance had found Responsive echoes, wakening soft around, To charm each heart into the dream that flies With the cold touch of life's realities! But how this were I know not! in her heart (As something known and cherished in youth's prime) My shadow might abide, and own a part In the bright memories of a pleasant time, Whose haunting whispers, through Thought's chambers lone, Might wake the Past with some familiar tone Of lingering power! as when across the strings Of an Æolian lyre, the wailing wind Steals to awaken fitful murmurings: So with the thought of vanished hours entwined, My name might break the silence of her mind, And die away—yet oh! not thus for me With my life's blessed dream dealt Memory. It was no dream! that on me unaware An angel aspect had serenely smiled; Thou wert no vision! though so strangely fair In spiritual beauty, saintly child! Though never more within this earthly wild I looked upon thy likeness; in my heart That blessed image dwelt—a thing apart! And not this World's harsh voices, not the din, The stir, that met me in life's crowded way, Have deadened in my soul the Voice within That thrilled me with Thy tones! and woke alway From vanished bliss the Promise of a day That yet should be! that gave Remembrance power To shed its glow upon the coming hour, And hold bright communing with Hope! E'en yet Within my heart those purer tones abide— Though long ago the murmur of regret, The passionate lament, the burst of pride Faded to stillness; these have never died: In that The Good dies not, nor owns the sway Of earthly Change—the bringer of decay! Not Time's unceasing waves, that on the shore Of Life slow-breaking, wear away the trace, Where Anguish passed so heavily of yore, And Passion sped upon its fiery race, And Joy's light footfall lingered, might efface The one bright impress that within my mind Dwelt, with all pure and holy things enshrined. And as within the folded flower will shrink A crystal tear-drop caught from morn's pale eye, That the hot breath of noonday may not drink, Nor the warm wind exhale upon its sigh; So the pure spirit of those days gone by, Yet lingers in my breast, a hidden spring Of inner joy, a Fount of freshening! And thus, though Age hath stirred a buried strife, And smote with feeble hand the trembling string That woke wild melodies when Youth and Life Swept o'er its chords in their tumultuous Spring; But softened echoes from the distance ring O'er the far Wild, as on the Mount I stand And gaze where lies the bright, the promised Land! THE MOURNING OF THE GAEL. The Highlanders are wont to this day to mingle a degree of solemn mirth in their mourning, and something akin to melancholy with their mirth.—The usual aversion to think or speak of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others. You hear not only the young mention (as is every where usual) the character and the merits of parents, who have in the course of nature predeceased them, but the widowed partner speaks in ordinary conversation of the lost spouse; and what is still stranger, the parents allude frequently to the valour or beauty of the child whom they have interred. The Scottish Highlanders appear to regard the separation of friends by Death as something less absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries; and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before them, as if they had gone upon a long journey, on which they themselves must soon follow. The Fair Maid of Perth, 11th Chap. [[I.]] “Ye weep not o'er your loved ones, as we weep— “Sons of the rock-bound glen and mountain lone! “Your calm and stedfast spirits may not own “The touch of weakness; yet can Memory sleep “With folded wings where Love was once so deep? “We stand upon our silent hearths alone, “Peopling the gloom with faces that are gone “While with our hearts we sad communion keep: “But Ye around the board where friends are met “Give open greeting to your fellow-men; “With steady voice and earnest eyes unwet, “Ye speak of Them—the vanish'd! as if then, “Their smile made sunshine round you; as if yet “The silent voice might answer yours again!” II. “We speak of them because we love them well. “They have not left us! and we shed no tear “That they are with us still—more pure, more dear! “Our hearts have not yet learned to say farewell! “Their voices died not for us in the knell “That told us they were gone! When none are near, “They speak to us through rustling branches sere, “As our old pines give back the wild winds swell. “And voices from the happy Past have spoken “In tales they loved, in songs they used to sing: “ An affecting custom prevails among the Highlanders of sending messages through dying friends, to those who have gone before. As other friends depart, they bear a token, “An earnest of the Faith to which we cling, “That the bright chain of Love is strained, not broken; “And comfort comes with our remembering. 1845. THE SONG OF DEATH. I thought that I had wandered on alone In an old wood, until the slanting light Of day's decaying gleam had well nigh gone, Fast fading into night! And now the red and melancholy ray, On the dark foliage kindling, faintly glow'd; The hush of Twilight fell, and on my way, The length'ning shade abode. A dreary forest! through that sombre glade No cry of bird, no sound of rustling plume, No hum of insect life within the shade Rose on the deep'ning gloom. But through the charméd stillness of the woods, The murmur of a stream, slow-rising, broke, And in those dim old forest solitudes Low solemn tones awoke. In deep, sonorous utterance those trees, (A wild harp smote in all its thousand strings) Cedar and pine gave forth upon the breeze Spiritual murmurings! My heart was still! it owned no pulse, no power, Chained by the working of a mighty spell; A Voice arose within that awful hour On the wind's fitful swell. And clear above that solemn under-tone, Those accents, breathing in their mournful change Of grief that communed with itself alone, In their aërial range, Stole on mine ear,—“God's spirit-ministers, In times and seasons work his mighty will; Long as this world upon its sad course wears, I labour still! All things have rest! Thy fruits, oh, kindly earth! Ripen from day to day in golden bloom, To find, within the breast that gave them birth, A life-renewing tomb. All things have Peace! Pale spiritual night, Brings sleep in that mysterious breast of hers, And wraps within her mantle darkly bright Each thing that breathes and stirs. Strange fate must still be mine! A weary lot— A deep repose I bring to all that live: I yearn for rest, and yet I find it not; I only give! I love,—it loves me not,—Humanity! I hear its wailing cry amid the gloom, With outstretch'd arms, how swiftly, tenderly, To soothe its grief I come! They call me harsh! Alas, they know not how Life, “Schon, o Tod, was, sanft entzücket An des Lebens Brust sich schmiegt, Sich zum süssen Liede wiegt Und zum Mutter-auge blicket.” Uhland. as a song-lulled babe upon my breast, I take with quiet kiss upon the brow, To an enduring rest. I bring, when other none on earth may bring, Relief unto the frame with suffering worn, And shower balm from my ethereal wing, For the sad heart forlorn. I open, to the bright exploring eyes, Beatitude! while on the unsealed ear, High choral strains and symphonies arise, Seraphic anthems clear! Yet gifts more stern are mine, oh, sons of men! Across the fulness of your pleasant things, Sadly and pale a vision fleets, and then, A dreary shadow flings. I stand, unbidden guest, within the hall, Where Pride, Wealth, Life, are met in revelry: There are strange characters upon the wall— Their import—“Vanity.” I hold a wondrous glass, where, pictured fair, The long-forgotten Past is clearly seen; The shrouded forms, of evil things that were, Of good that might have been! My breath is cold! O children of a day, Your Age's treasure-hoards, your dreams of Youth, Fade like a mist before its touch away, Mine is the gift of Truth! It is my mission! Well, alas! I know Men love me not, a hollow tone of fear Lurks in my name, and shadowy forms of woe Still with my step appear. And from the aspect of my Semblance dim Chill'd Life recoils appall'd—Thus let it be! Stern Teacher hath Existence been to Him That shrinketh not from Me! Yet some have learnt deep lessons! from their side Bright things have vanished and returned no more— And Earth seems desolate—they seek a Guide To treasures gone before, They follow where I lead! As when the breeze Shakes down upon the earth a blighted shower Of crispéd leaves from sere autumnal trees, Earth recks of them no more! I give them Love and friends! I can bestow A lasting country, an eternal home; Marvel not that with joy the Sons of woe Can hear me say, “I come.” Yet for my coming may not pine the good, Not theirs, nor mine the knowledge, when the stroke May fall, to blight the sapling of the wood, Or rend its aged oak. This blessed truth alone we haply know, Whene'er my Hour—the Hour appointed come, Faith hears soft words of kindly greeting flow From a long-parted Home! And as those accents died, a solemn word, “Soon as this long, sad, earthly Night is o'er, Merg'd in the brightness of that blessed Dawn— Thy pale lamp, Spirit-worn, Shall sink to rise no more,” Fell voiceless! as its tones were felt, not heard, And dimly faded on mine awe-struck ear; Echoes that ran along the shivering wood, Slow-mingling with the murmurs of that flood, Until in spiritual flute-notes clear They passed—I was alone. THE SHEPHERD'S SABBATH SONG. Uhland. This is the Lord's bright Day! I am alone upon the plains—no sound Of Morning-Bells awaken round With music on my way. Yet, kneeling here, I pray, Oh Lord! in silent awe! I feel That Many also pray, and kneel Unseen, beside me here!— The listening Heavens are clear As if, through solemn depths of blue Their Doors were opening on my view— This is the Lord's bright Day! THE REJECTED. Such a sweetness! A virtue in which all ennobling thoughts dwelt, Pure thoughts, high thoughts, kind thoughts! her sex's wonder! Farewell, farewell! sweet maiden! The word whose sound is pain, From Thee lost all its bitterness, Though Sorrow will remain, Deep as the troubled tenderness With which the accents fell, Which bade me take of Hope and Thee A long and last farewell! Hard seemed it that each faltering word, That made sad truth more clear, But showed the Heart it had not erred In holding thee so dear! Though mine through many a silent year, Hath breathed for Thee its vow; Though Thou wert ever loved—yet ne'er More tenderly than now! Farewell, farewell! kind maiden! We do not part in scorn; To find thy Heart ungenerous, My own had hardly borne. To know another owns its love, Can only wake the prayer, That His may give back wealth for wealth, For all the treasure there! And thine has been a worthy choice! A happy lot be thine! Blest with the Love that I had given, And gifts surpassing mine! For Nature smiled upon His birth With boons denied to me, And gave them all a dearer worth In that they pleased Thee. I might have guess'd, fair maiden! That mine was not the art, The form to please a maiden's eye, The speech that wins her heart! But outward gifts seemed unto thee, E'en in thy radiant youth, Of less account than honesty, Less dear than simple truth! Wert thou like others I had thought, “Strange would it seem that she Should give her heart to one that nursed Her childhood on his knee.” But when I saw thy winning ways And heard thy soft speech fall, The ear that drank its tones forgot That thou wert kind to all. Small skill was mine, it now appears, Small knowledge mine the while, To read a gentle maiden's Heart, To pierce its simple wile; If I had owned its faintest throb, Not thus would'st thou have giv'n The frank, the ready confidence, The smile that made my heaven! Yet grieve not Thou that harm hath chanced Where least it was designed; Be still as Thou hast ever been Ingenuous and kind; Though now it pains thee 'mid the joy That happier feelings wake Within thy Heart, to know that mine Hath suffered for thy sake! Farewell, farewell! my dream is o'er, Yet not with it departs The image lastingly enshrin'd Within my heart of hearts! Fair form! pure spirit! trusting soul! I need no deeper spell, To bind my faith in lovely things, Than to have loved thee well! 1846. THE CHILD OF SORROW. FOUNDED UPON AN INCIDENT IN REAL LIFE. “The salt drops, mingling with the milk she drew, “Gave the sad presage of her future years, “The child of misery—baptized in tears.” Langhorne. There was no cheering voice—no mother smiled, In bliss o'ermastering anguish, on thy birth, No heart rejoiced in that another child Was born unto our earth! But wild despairing accents greeted thee; “Ah better far that thou hadst not been born, “Than come unto a weary world to be, “Like all of us, forlorn!” For ruin darkened round that hearth—the face Of Poverty had grown familiar there; And in her lineaments they only trace The features of despair, Who have been nursed in all that life can yield; Their basket still o'erflowing, and their store, Within the house, the garner, and the field, Abounding more and more! And now the shadow of their household peace Is far removëd, and the pleasant sound Of childish voices in that home must cease— No echoes wake around. For they who used at twilight hour to strive To be the first to gain a father's side, Have learned to eat the bread that strangers give, And in strange homes abide. And scattered far, alas! how far apart, No mother's smile to cheer with love and praise, With no fond sister heart to answer heart, They struggle through Earth's ways. But She, the pale and quiet Winter-flower, That reared its lowly head amid the storm, The gentle child of an ungentle hour, Was met with love heart-warm. And she was blest, abiding among those Whom God hath sent for friends unto our need, Theirs was the love that Christian Kindred owes, In fervent thought and deed. And to those friends her orphaned feelings clung; If absent, o'er them answering love would yearn, And on her lips the accents ever hung, “Oh! when will they return?” Yet as an infant, seated far apart, While others played, the choking sob would rise, And tear-drops flow, as if that childish heart Rained with them through her eyes! And they would say in tenderness, “My child, “Why dost thou weep, are we not kind to thee?” The broken words rose mournfully and mild, “Ye are all kind to me.” “I know not why I weep!” She did not know That sighs had lulled her as a babe to sleep; Unconscious pupil in the school of woe, She learned too soon to weep! Alas!—we thought, such tears are unto us From life's ungentle teachings a relief; Thy opening being gives unto thee thus Existence with its Grief! With the dim shadows after-years have cast, Ye mingle not, O days that brightly flowed; No mournful echo rises from the past, Where youth with hope abode! But in the book of Life's Realities Our childhood lies, a fresh and fairy page, Undimmed by tears! inscribed with memories To cheer a later age. Then Innocence, and bright unconscious Truth, Wrote Angel-meanings on the open brow, The Spirit-World that was our home in youth Returns in visions now! And through our hearts, while thought and feeling last, Fresh, youthful impulse thrills,—yet once again,— As fond Remembrance wakes the buried past, With all that we were then! Poor child of grief, that never wert a child, And are there some among us then like Thee? For whom no green spot blooms amid the wild To freshen memory! Who, even in the morning of their day, When all was gladness round them, walked apart, And felt the sunshine banished from their way By a care-saddened heart. Oh! if within the borders of the land, Where amid pleasant places rest our lines, Estrang'd and sad, among the kindred band, Too many an alien pines! If with the race by Heaven ordained of yore, In this world's fulness they may claim no part, Let not their portion fail, to find the more A Home in every heart! O fount of Life! thine were a bitter flow Did not soft promptings reach us from above, To bid us in those sullen waters throw The healing branch of love! 1845. THE SILENT GRAVE-STONE. In the Church-yard of Lillington, (Warwickshire,) is a monumental stone in the form of a cross, simply inscribed, “Hugo.—1845.” “Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.” Jer. xxii. 10. A quiet scene! here 'mid the stillness deep The Living with the dead awhile might sleep; Here, while the brooding day-light dimly falls Through flow'ring limes and verdurous beechen walls, And faint upon the perfume-laden breeze Rise dream-like murmurings of summer bees, And all that stirs above us and around, Breathes of the smiling charm of Southern ground, We leave afar the turmoil and the strife The restless energy of common life, And, soothed in heart, with chastened spirit yield To the calm influence of God's quiet field. The beautiful expressions, Gottes-acker and Fried-hof, constantly recur in German church-yards, in place of the ordinary word Kirch-hof. For here all worldly care and troubles cease, No vexing mem'ry haunts the Court of Peace! And gazing round upon its records fair Of all the social virtues garnered there, We pause awhile, and gravely smile to see Stern Truth yield gentle place to charity! All breathes of Home, and its familiar ties, Its voice of love, and kindliest sympathies; All proves, that e'en in death Affection still Would shield the much loved name from thought of ill! But see, upon the cross erected high, A stranger name arrests the wandering eye; Hugo! a stranger name! no date, nor age To trace the period of his pilgrimage; Far from the mother-land that gave him birth, His dust re-mingled with its kindred earth; Amid the land of homes, an alien, he, Met the dread summons to eternity! Was there no voice to soothe, no eye to weep, No heart, affection's vigil-watch to keep? No hand to trace a word of hope, of prayer, Upon our christian emblem reared there? No tongue to speak, when thou departedst, “Peace!” Or tell of lands where sin and sorrow cease? Perhaps in some far distant land, for him The straining eye of tenderness grew dim; Perhaps for him arose the nightly prayer, The mother's brow a deeper shade might wear; The constant thought, the daily anxious care, Might sprinkle silvery tokens o'er her hair; Brothers and sisters, too, a kindly band, Might yearn to greet him from the stranger's land, To kiss his brow and tenderly to clasp The willing hand in home's endearing grasp, And in the tones his childhood loved, to tell Of change that Time had wrought since his farewell. Or one perchance—we know not—he might be, For whom this wide earth holds no sanctuary; And through its many nations he might roam, And find them all, alike, without a Home! Hugo, farewell! what thou hast been, to us Must dark remain and still mysterious! We know not if thy steps from childhood's day Still constant kept the straight and narrow way; Or did amidst the paths of error roam, Still straying further from a heavenly home, Until our Shepherd's kind constraining hand Drew thee in love towards the father-land! We know it not;—we too must humbly say, That we have gone within the wild astray, We too must hope, through him, restored, forgiven, To rest within the smile that lights up heaven! There—there—the wand'rer need no longer roam, The way-worn stranger finds a lasting home! And Father's, Mother's fondness, all will prove In Him that loves with more than Brother's love! THE LAST WISH. Oh! 'tis hame and 'tis hame that I fain wad be, Hame, hame, hame—in my ain countrie! Oh! this is a fairy islet, And softly its breezes blow, Sweet, sweet as the breath of the violet, Yet my deep soul pines to go To a land that is not so fair, Mother, But far more dear to me; For the kindly hearts beat there, Mother, That were ever true to me. O to visit the pleasant places Where I played in days of yore, O to see those much-loved faces Look down on me once more! To feel their kisses on my cheek, Their blessing on my heart, Were a deeper joy than words might speak, Once—once! ere I depart! How brightly shines the myrtle With starry blossoms gay, And soft cooings of the turtle Float through the summer day;— Yet to stand once more beneath those trees, Our dewy-flowering limes, When cawing rooks come o'er the leas, Were sweeter many times! And to walk within our garden old As in pleasant bygone hours, Or on the high and breezy wold To pluck the moorland flowers, Where I roamed with my own dear brother, Till the summer day was o'er; O to see his earnest eyes, mother, Look on me in love once more! The last fond kiss my father prest With tears upon my brow, Fell like the dew upon my breast, It rests there even now! And the blessing that he gave my then Hath never left my heart, And I would feel its might again Once,—once! ere I depart. And O my friends, my much-loved friends, The thought of you is dear! And the shadow of your presence blends, With all that greets me here; Your voices sound in chiming streams, Ye kneel with me in prayer, And your fond smile answers mine in dreams, Ye are there! my Friends, ye are there! And I feel that the buds of human love, Though withered by our tears, Will burst in brighter bloom above, 'Mid the joy of endless years. But I know not what your looks may be, When we meet on that happier shore, And I fain unchanged on earth would see The smiles so loved of yore! O home, dear home! thy vision fair Is shrin'd within my breast, Might but the message find me there, That summons me to rest! For eager thoughts within me swell, And peace may not be mine, Until from the home I have loved so well, I pass to the Home divine. For I feel the struggle will be brief, And quickly o'er the strife, I know that I hang a withered leaf Her leaf is withered on the tree of life.—Thalaba. Upon God's tree of life. But I bear within a will resigned, And an unlingering heart; Yet would look on those I leave behind, Yet once,—ere I depart! And God's own poor should pray for me On the blessed sabbath-day, And a peaceful parting mine would be, I should gently pass away; And the love that makes it hard to part, With its strong, enduring chain, Shall bind us viewless, heart to heart, Until we meet again! THE LOVE OF THE HUMBLE. The moon looks upon many flowers, the flowers see one moon!—Persian Saying, quoted by Sir W. Jones. Love me a little! oh! it is not much That I would seek to claim from thee; To own within thy heart a softened touch Of what is felt by me! Love me a little!—I have not to learn How deep Affection on its strength may live; And mine is that which asks not for return, Thou hast it not to give! For the bright moon looks down on many flowers, And gladdens them with dews, her soothing boon, But through night's long and silent hours, The flowers see one moon! And Reverence like a soft attendant star That joys to merge its paly beams within The glory it has followed from afar, Would seek not more to win! And thus I would not claim a sphere more bright, Nor strive to reach an orbit nearer thine, Within a circle of reflected light Oh! how content to shine! Love me a little! give me but a place Within the heart where many inmates dwell, It were enough, though now upon thy face I look no more; farewell! THE CHRISTMAS TREE. Christmas comes but once a year! Come as in the olden time, With cheer and gift, with song and rhyme! The Christmas Tree! the Christmas Tree! Rich are the fruits that hang on thee! Fair are the flowers that on thee blow, The fadeless blooms of the wreaths of snow; More prized than summer's wreaths, more fair Than the smile old autumn's trophies wear, When he heaps the bright spoil of the tribute year; The first glad flower, the flower of spring We would leave for these, a withering! Hail to the fir! hail to the fir! Where is the tree may vie with her! She shot up strong in a single night With fairy flowers, and gleaming fruits But yester-morn her boughs were white, Snow on the branches, deep snow round the roots, Snow, snow! her arms spread wide In the misty air like a spirit-bride; Green, green! now, they wave so green, The glowing orange set between; And the blushing rose her home hath made, Amid the gloom of their dusky shade; Where was the charm that framed the spell, That wrought the radiant miracle! That brought such brilliant buds to blow, That ripened fruitage 'mid the snow— It was something warm, so very warm, That cold may never work it harm; A kindly dew that will not freeze, That fell to raise such blooms as these; Something strong as the fir-tree and deep as its hue, Found fadeless and firm, when the keen storm-winds blew; It was Love! kind Love! that raised thee here, Love for the friends that are near and dear! It is thought for the absent that shines in thee, Hail! all hail to the Christmas Tree! When Summer comes the elm lifts high Her leafy towers to the deep blue sky, The aspen shakes in the pale moon-beam, And the willow-bough kisses the glancing stream; The Larch is fringed with its softest green And the Birch waves light with a lady's mien; “The weeping Birch, the lady of the woods.” Coleridge. While the oak grows green, and broad, and high, As if knowing its lofty destiny, The boast of the sea-queen's sons to be, The emblem-badge of the brave and free! And the graceful ash, to come so slow, Is swift, fair child of earth, to go; The poplar beareth his honours well, As he stands like a sylvan sentinel, Stately and stiff, by the cherry's side, That woodland maid in her silvery pride! The cedars' massive growths are laid Each under each, a pile of shade; The chesnut rears its orient cone, And palm-like leaf, in our woods alone; And the lime throws out flowers for the wandering Bee, Sweet as the gifts of the Christmas Tree! When Autumn comes, a spirit broods, With changeful spell, o'er the gleaming woods; And lends in the beauty of soft decay, A richer charm than it takes away! Solemn and deep! the glow it flings Was caught from the hues of an angel's wings; Not long may those chastened splendours last, For the bringer of change hath o'er them past, And on the bough the lessening ray Dies, in its own red light, away, As the sun-set's smile on the kindling leaf Meets sun-set's flash, as bright, as brief; And the leaves that made woodland wanderings sweet, Will soon lie withered around our feet, And claim, in the tale of their soft farewell, Of a deeper change than their own to tell; And we, who fade as they fade, Isaiah lxiv. 6. must learn For the fadeless leaf of that Branch to yearn Whose verdure is for eternity; Hail! all hail! to the Christmas Tree! SABBATH PEACE. “O day most calm—most bright, “The fruit of this, the next world's bud, “The indorsement of supreme delight “Writ by a Friend, and with his blood; “The couch of Time, Care's balm and bay:— “The week were dark, but for thy light; “Thy torch doth show the way. “The Sundays of man's life “Threaded together on Time's string “Make bracelets to adorn the Wife “Of the eternal, glorious King; “On Sunday Heaven's gate stands ope; “Blessings are plentiful and rife, “More plentiful than hope!” How sweet are thy returns! how dear The boons of promise thine to give, O day of heavenly foretaste here, To all that breathe and live! Bright Sabbath! when of yore Ere Sin might yet defile, Or dim the World that wore Its first and radiant smile, Thy peace stole on our earth Mid'st harmonies of love, To lead, in a more blissful birth, To deeper peace above! The pilgrim traveller in Thee may find, Journeying between two worlds, a resting place, As pressing forward, leaving things behind, He goes from grace to grace. Thou art the spirit's calm,— A sacred well of peace; Wherein to lave our hearts in balm, And bid their throbbings cease. Thou art the week's soft dew! On our exhausted powers, Falling, their freshness to renew, In kindly showers. Let not the heart be dry, an arid spot, Like the young ruler's fleece, when soft around Heaven's balmy tear-drops fell, yet touched it not, Though all refreshed the ground! Thou art our week's kind sleep! Soft stealing o'er our strife, In soothing guardianship to keep The fever pulse of life. Thou art our week's glad star! Oh! purest of the seven, Amid our darkness shining from afar With guiding ray to heaven. Our souls are dark, alas! our lamps are dim, Their radiance quenched 'mid daily care and toil Until Thou bringëst a calm hour to trim The spirit-light with oil. Thou art a halcyon on the troubled sea Of Time, whereon the wild wave foams and swells— An angel-voice speaks of eternity In those calm sabbath bells! And with that matin music on the track That after years have dimmed, with kindling joy The well-remembered summons hath brought back The spirit of the boy! Thou art our Christian feast! Thou art the poor man's day! From his six days of burdened toil, releas'd, He flings his cares away. He walks upon God's earth with thoughtful mien, In decent garb attends the house of prayer, With children clinging round,—his face serene Is freshened by heaven's air! His wife looks comely in his eyes, as when She took on her the well-kept marriage vow; Times were that he was nothing among men, He feels his Being now. His spirit claims in social bonds its part, A kindred place in no mean Brother-hood; He looks abroad, and owns within his heart, That all is very good. Oh! rankling cares of Earth, Your bonds are loos'd for a brief space; farewell! Farewell! oh yet more vain, more weary, mirth,— The heart holds festival! And gladness hovers o'er the thoughts of men This blessed day, remembering him who gave The hour of triumph,—bringing victory then, Uprising from the grave. Thus shall our earthly Sabbaths, rich in love, Be as a linkëd chain let down from high To draw us to that lasting one above, A blest Eternity! THE HOME GRIEF. The Mal-du-Pays, or, as it is touchingly expressed in German, das Heim-weh (Home-grief), is a lingering and often fatal disease, incident to persons condemned to long and hopeless separation from their native land, and more peculiarly affecting the inhabitants of mountainous countries, and those who have been called from the peaceful occupations of country life, to undertake harassing military duty in distant regions. The malady raged as an epidemic during the long wars succeeding upon the French revolution, both among the conscripts and foreign subsidiaries; it manifests itself by a profound dejection, during which the mind occupies itself incessantly with recollections of the absent Home; a feverish sleep, agitated by restless dreams, transports the sufferer to the scenes he is pining to re-visit, the nervous system becomes open to every morbid impression, and the whole being is unhinged. The sufferer shuns society, and cautiously avoids reference to the cause of his uneasiness. This reserve is a distinguishing and singular feature of the disease, over which medicine has no power, and the arguments of reason as little, unless they hold out the prospect of a return homewards, which has a wonderful and sometimes instantaneous effect, even when the fulfilment of the promise is likely to be remote. The well known Swiss pastoral air of the “Ranz des Vaches,” was supposed, from the familiar associations it awakened, to have such an effect in causing this disorder, many mountaineers in the French service deserting upon hearing it, as to be at one time forbidden to be played in that army under pain of death. Many of the simple Volks-Lieder of the country allude to this singular Home-sickness in very affecting terms. “Herz, mein Herz warum so traurig? “Und was soll das Ach und Weh? “'Sist auch schön in fremden Landen “Herz, mein Herz was fehlt dir mehr.” “In die Heimath möcht ich wieder “Aber bald, ach! ja recht bald “Möcht zum Vater, möcht zum Mutter “Möcht zu Berge, Thal und Wald!” Schweizer Heim-weh. Oh faithful friend! and dost thou seek To read my frequent sigh? The secret of my changing cheek And the trouble in mine eye? Yes! it is well that I should speak, I will reveal to thee The grief, (though thou mayest deem it weak) That craves not sympathy— For who can yield that unto me? Not thou, not thou, my friend! Thy soul hath never pined to be Once more in the wilds where the torrent free Flings feathery spray from the rock around, And hangs like a veil of foam! Thy heart from its depths hath not yearned to see The glittering peak by the glacier bound, Where the foot of the hunter may never roam, White with the snows of eternity, Rise clear above thy home! There, there! to be where once I dwelt, To stand where free men stand, On the soil where none save to God have knelt, Where my Father sleeps—where my mother weeps For her son—in my own Land! My brother, I have found thee true, I will tell to thee my tale, Thou hast known me long, and never knew My heart or my spirit fail; When quick around the death fires flew, And the shots fell thick like hail; When the battle raged, and the looks were few, But turned in its red glare, pale; We have braved the wild depths of northern snows, We have felt the fiery breath, That hot o'er the sands of the desert blows With the burning kiss of Death; We have looked on him in the ghastly forms, That plague and famine wear, High on the deck amid whirling storms We have dared what man may dare. Did my firm step lose its vigour there? Tell me! for I would fain Recall once more from the things that were My truer self again; I bore me then as one may bear Who hath learned to be strong to die, Whose youth drank in with his mountain air The breath of liberty! Whose step hath tracked the ice-fed rills, Where the chamois comes not near, Who hath heard God speak 'mid the echoing hills, Hath heard! yet knew not fear; Yet a nameless dread now stirs my breast With flutterings faint and slow, With troubled dreams and a vague unrest, And my pulse runs weak and low; My nerveless hand owns a feeble grasp, Ye may count each languid vein, Yet to meet the warmth of a kindred clasp, Might give back its strength again! Might I but bathe my fevered breast In the freshening airs that blow Cool through the vale, where the mountain's crest Hangs heavy with unsunned snow! There, there where those bright streams swiftly flow, It would brace my step to stand, Where the sea-green rills rush down from the hills Pure!—in my own Land! There, by the spray of the torrent's dash Might I lay, as I rested then In the sultry noon, and heard the crash, The sullen roar of the avalanche Break high o'er the rock-bound glen!— Bright through the snows, the alpine rose, Glowed with a blush of fire; High in the air, I watched him there, Our mountain Lammer-geier; There from the peaks that none have trod The bright arch spans the sky, There, there the blue lake lifts to God Its broad unslumbering eye! With splintered crags that pierce the skies, Each guarding well its post, In the narrow pass the cliffs arise That might hold at bay a host; Each giant sentinel hath long Kept duly watch and ward; Begirt with fearless hearts as strong The Home and Father-land from wrong Inviolate to guard— With naked breast on the glittering death They rush, a peasant band; Free they must breathe, or yield their breath Freely in their own land! No marvel that they firmly stand For Freedom The words Fur Freiheit und Vater-Land may be traced in many a swiss Thermopylæ upon the stone which records the names of those who fell there “fighting 'gainst fearful odds.” and for God, When the sons of the mountain father-land Draw strength from their native sod! While rock, and stream, and solemn sky Attest each valiant deed, That looked, in ages long gone by On Tell and Winkleried! At the battle of Sempach (1386) the troops of the Swiss Confederates vainly attempted to break the Austrian line, and were thrown back in great disorder from the firm array of pikes which repelled their impetuous charge; at this critical moment Arnold Von Winkelried, a knight of Unterwalden, rushed forth, and exclaiming, “Sworn Confederates, take care of my wife and children, I open a lane for freedom!” grasped eight spears within his arms and thus broke the Austrian Phalanx: a signal victory ensued. Many a rudely sculptured figure over the fountain in the market-place of a Swiss village, or yet more rude fresco on the wayside Chapel, attest the veneration in which his countrymen to this day hold the memory of Him, Of battle-martyrs chief! Who to recall his daunted peers, For victory shaped an open space, By gathering with a wide embrace Within his single breast, a sheaf Of fatal Austrian spears! Safe in your arms the sacred treasure keep, Guard well, O quiet hills, the holy grave, Where they are laid to take their happy sleep, The faithful and the brave! Still rests their spirit on the ransomed land, Still may the stranger mark its childhood's game Of mimic war! yet duteous to command And emulous of fame. Thus, thus! my little brothers play, And wish they were but men, They speak of me, and yearn to see From the long wars some happy day My coming form again. Yes! they pine to see my face again! And to hold me by the hand, Yet they may play for many a day Ere I come—to my own land! Thou heardest that wild and simple strain, And it seemëd strange to thee, That manhood could so ill restrain The sad tear falling free— It seemed to thee but an uncouth lay, The herdsman's echoing call, To bring back his kine at close of day, When lengthening shadows fall; It spoke to me of daylight's close! That soft decline and clear, That flushing o'er the deep vale glows Red from the glacier. Yes! in its wild and dying fall, It brought the close of day O'er my mind's vision, with them all That meet in twilight gray; They sit beneath the walnut trees, There, through the silent air, Borne heavenwards soft upon the breeze Arise the tones of prayer! Mid shadows dim, their vesper hymn Floats through our valley fair Soft, soft above—with words of love I am not forgotten there; While with its notes one gentle voice Is raised at even-tide, My heart, my true heart's earliest choice, She that had been my bride, But for war's cruel chance, ere now— Still her heart holds its truth, And constant keeps for me the vow, The promise of our youth! When may I claim, oh, gentle one! In the joy of the kindred band, The heart that hath beat for me alone, And hold thy faithful hand! When shall I claim thee for my own And by the altar stand! Long may'st thou wait, for thy plighted mate, For me—in my own land. Yet by the hearth, and in the heart, Keep well my wonted place, I may come once more to claim my part In the fond, the kind embrace! I may come, oh! cherished ones, once more, Foot-worn at close of day, When the fathers sit before the door And watch the young ones play. Still, mother! let the green wreath lay Fresh, on my father's grave, Strength hath been with me on my way Through that last kiss he gave! Guard well my alpine staff, my boat, Safe moored within the cave, Yet may it bear thy son afloat Upon the heaven-blue wave. O friend! true friend, fond hopes will rise, The earnest of my prayers, Once more to read within their eyes, The look affection wears; Yet, yet upon my eager ear Shall fall the welcoming strain, The greeting of the kindred band To the long-lost, found again! For he who giveth Love will give The pure, the kindly breath, To fan its flame, and bid it live When nature pines in death— Oh friend! beside me might'st thou stand As thou so oft hast stood, When the son of the mountain-Father-land Returns to the hill and flood; When with welcome sweet they joyful greet The hasty fall of my coming feet, There, in my own land! THE DYING CHILD. A little child lay on his bed And drew a heavy breath, And moaning raised his weary head, Damp with the dews of Death; Upon his bed the sunset cast The broad and yellow ray, That oft in pleasant evenings past Had warned him from his play; He clasped his Mother's hand and sighed And to his lip arose A little prayer he learnt beside Her knee at even's close. And thus he prayed, ere darkness stole Upon the silence deep, The Blessed One to keep his soul, And guard him in his sleep. “Oh! gentle Jesus, meek and mild, “Look down on me, a little child; “Oh! pity my simplicity, “And grant me grace to come to Thee! “Four corners are around my bed, “At every one an Angel spread; “One to lead me, one to feed me, “Two to take my soul to Heaven.” “And they will take it soon, I know I have not long to wait, Ere with those Shining Ones I go Within the pearly gate; Ere I shall look upon His face, Who died that I might live With Him for ever, through the grace That none save he can give! I go where the happy waters flow By the city of our King, Where never cometh pain nor woe, Nor any evil thing. I go to play beneath the tree Upon whose branches high The pleasant fruits of healing be, That none may taste and die. I go to join the blessed throng Who walk arrayed in white, To learn of them the holy song That rises day and night. I see them by the emerald light Rev. iv. ver. 3. Shed by the living Bow, Young seraph faces, pure and bright, More fair than aught below! Oh! come to me, ye blessed ones, And take me to your arms, I know you by your shining robes And by your waving palms. Your robes Rev. vii. ver. 13, 14. are pure from every stain— Not Rachel's bitter tears Had wrought such whiteness through the rain Of long and evil years! Your smiles are sweet as is the babe's Upon my Mother's knee— Oh little one! I would that Thou Wert there along with me! How happily our days would flow Where all is glad and fair— Ah! might the faces that I know But look upon me there! For something dear will fail awhile In those abodes of bliss,— The sweetness of my Mother's smile, My Father's evening kiss. If They will miss me on the Earth, I shall miss Them above, And 'mid the holy angel-mirth Shall think on Those I love. But when they come I shall be first To give them welcome sweet, My voice shall swell the joyous burst That doth the ransomed greet! I come, Oh Saviour! yes, I haste Thy ransomed child to be, Yet I have many on the Earth, And none in Heaven but Thee!” And then a Voice spake soft and clear “Whom wouldst thou have but me? Who, in the Heavens or with thee here, Hath owned such love for thee?” And the child folded his wan hands, and smiled As o'er a blissful meaning—but his breath Failed in the happy utterance, as he met His Father's kiss upon the lip of Death. MIGNON'S SONG. Goethe. Know'st thou the land? where the pale Citron blows, And through its leaves the golden Orange glows; Soft breathe the warm winds through that Summer sky, And the bright Laurel gleams the Myrtle nigh; Know'st thou it well? Beloved, there with thee, Would that my home, oh dear one, still might be! Know'st thou the house? it rests on columns;— there Within the hall the pictures glisten fair; There, coldly gleaming, marble forms arise, And look on me. poor child, with questioning eyes. Know'st thou it well? There, oh my guardian friend! Thither with thee, protector, I would wend! Know'st thou the hills? amid the clouds they lie! Slow climbs the Mule the misty pathway high: There caverned lurk the ancient Dragon-brood, Where, o'er the Rock, falls wide the arrowy flood. Know'st thou them well? oh thither lies our way; Let us, oh Father, seek it as we may! THE VIGIL OF RIZPAH. 2 Samuel, xxi. 8—10. “There is a comfort in the strength of Love, Making that pang endurable, which else, Would overset the brain, or break the heart.” A lonely watcher on the mountain-height, There with her dead a solemn tryst to keep, Communing silently with anguish deep, Yet patient, strong in Love's untiring might, The morn's red day-beam found her, and the night Bathed her in gentle dews, yet might not steep The pulse of agony in gentler sleep, Soft stealing o'er that mourner's aching sight; There, while the long and summer sun rode high, No cry of bird awoke the solitude; When darkness fell, no savage thing and rude To mar the spell of holy grief drew nigh,— She watched, till Heaven with kind and pitying eye With reconciling tears their dust bedewed! LE BIEN NE MEURT JAMAIS. “Si tu as bien fait dans les petites choses, tâchede bien faire aussi dans les grandes, car, le bien ne meurt jamais. Le Prince Juan Manuel de Castille, 13th Century. [[I.]] Oh faithful words! the Good may never die! Though weak the hopeful germ, and slowly here, Unto the full corn in its perfect ear, The scattered seeds of promise ripening lie, They bear a fruitage for eternity! Faith's soft, unspoken utterance, the tear That falls o'er sin when none save God is near, The kiss of kind forgiveness, and the sigh For other's woe! small off'rings these may be, Yet precious unto God their odorous breath, For in His eyes, who sees not as men see, The Will embalms the Deed with sanctity— These are the palm-leaves of our fadeless wreath! The amaranth-blooms that own no touch of Death! II. If Good that once hath been may perish never, If Truth and Wisdom fail not of their meed, If the pure Thought unto the righteous Deed Is linked by bonds no earthly chance may sever, What care should then be ours, what high endeavour, To lend to our life's deep import earnest heed, Since in each action lives a wingëd seed With self-renewing power instinct for ever! He that hath sowed in Hope shall come again And bear his sheaves unto the Garner bound, The bread by Faith cast forth upon the main Shall be returned! the draught 2 Samuel, xxiii. 15, 16, 17. that on the ground Was poured, ascending soft to Heaven, in rain Shall fall, and shed a dew of blessing round! TO M. K?. [[I.]] I sing to thee! though many a painful year Hath fleeted o'er me, since the witcheries Of thy dear smile, and darkly glorious eyes Have answered mine! or fallen on mine ear Thy low, light laugh, so musically clear, (Soft undertone to graceful pleasantries!) As in its angel-accents did arise Thy pleading voice! Yet Memory holds thee dear, And at the sight of thy remembered hand Voices, that long have slept, the silence break, And dreams of earlier days in life-like truth Give back our friends of old, a kindly band; While laughter and familiar tones awake, Renewing thus the vision of my Youth! II. Think not, dear friend, because a latent tone Of sadness lingered in the voice that spoke Of bygone years, as Memory's pictures broke Upon my view, and colours that had flown Returned to life in bright hues of her own, As at her magic touch the past awoke, That over faded joys I idly moan! For though a primal glory may depart With our first youth, yet sunshine from our way May never vanish, when the steadfast heart Yearns but to greet a yet more perfect day! E'en thus, O bright and gifted friend! with thee Through thy life's journey may it ever be! 1846. ANNUNCIATA. The Improvisatore, by H. C. Andersen. [[I.]] I Saw her beautiful before me stand— Annunciata! like a breathing Grace, The bright ideal of some antique race, Fraught with the spirit of their soul-lit land; Thus, with a queen-like gesture of the hand She moved! a gentle majesty found place In the soft glow of that illumined face, Where genius dwelt, soul-dowered with command O'er Mind and Heart! One impulse shook and stirred That vast assemblage as the tide of song Flowed, wave on wave! with inward rapture strong Each breath was hush'd, in fear her lightest word Should fall upon the charmëd sense unheard, As that impassioned current rolled along! II. I saw her stand before the unpitying throng— Annunciata! every gift had fled, The soul of melody within was dead, Heart-withered through ungentle fortune's wrong, I saw her! loved so well and mourned so long— Yet round thy humbled and discrownëd head A soft unfading halo lingerëd, My youth's lost star! bright priestess-queen of song,— Still in the light of that once glorious eye, All other sparkle quenched—shone purity! Still on those weak and broken accents hung Faint echoes of a day when hope was young, And seemed its requiem and dirge to be, Sad!—from that lofty nature's strength outwrung. ON READING THE LEGENDARY TALES OF THE BARON AND BARONESS DE LA MOTTE FOUQUE. Such days were never! Still must I envy them the age That favoured such a dream !— Cowper. [[I.]] Oh! gentle pair! how pleasantly along Our life's uneven journey, side by side, Heart-linked in fate and genius, do ye glide! With hands that sever but to choose among The breathing blooms of poesy and song, Embroidering your flower-strown path and wide; There, oft, saluting you, with gentle pride And gallant bearing, pass a knightly throng. With gracious smile the courtesy ye own, And greet the virtue of the antique time, The stainless faith unsullied by a crime, The crest that vailed itself to God alone In humble glory! “Umile in tanta gloria.” greet them as your own, And shrine within the kindling tale and rhyme! II. Still may arise upon the water's swell, Her name Undine. who did our troubled being take, Whose slumbering soul did through its love awake To trembling life! Ah! might thy sad farewell, True hearted maid, with faint fore-shadowing tell How Love may deal with hearts that for his sake Rise to a new existence but to break! Still weave, ye gentle pair, afresh the spell,— Still be it yours within our actual world To cull the bright, sweet flowers of phantasy; To see at will its gorgeous scroll unfurled, Rich with all hues that rare and wondrous be, To meet the faery flute-note rising clear, And yield the pure and softened echo here! THE MEMORIAL OF MARY. S. Mark xiv. 9. [[I.]] “They who have much received will love the more, “Seest thou this woman's deed?” Oh record fair Of love that gave its all, nor sought with care To tell its treasure duly o'er and o'er, Or count the cost! well knowing that its store Might spend its fulness and rest debtor there! Of penitence that dried with unbound hair The holy feet its tears had washed before; Of faith that read within that eye benign The mild approval of its sacrifice, That heard the meek upbraiding “kiss of thine, “Or tear I found not,” greet the worldly wise, That met the gracious sentence, “Mary, rise! “Thy name shall live for ever, linked with mine!” II.S. John xii. 7, 8. “Blame not the woman in that she hath striven “To pay me honour in the thing she could “Against my burial, duteous, she hath strewed “The precious odours of a soul forgiven, “And wrought a holy deed approved of Heaven. “Let not man blame her fond solicitude! “Not from the poor hath she withholden good, “In what her Faith unto their Lord hath given.” So spak'st Thou, Saviour! O that even so, Whether we break the costly box, or bring But unto Thée the heart's sad offering Of tears that crave to mingle with thy blood, It may be ours the joyful sound to know, “Your work is blessed—doing that ye could.” Quinquagesima Sunday. 1847. ON VISITING AN ARTIST'S STUDIO. [[I.]] As one, whose slow and waking step with Care Hath journeyed on through pathways dim and cold, Yet dreaming, sees more blissful scenes unfold, And the bright inmates of the upper air Descend on earth adown Sleep's shining stair; And seems to view heaven's lofty gates unrolled, As to the way-worn Patriarch of old,— Thus with mine eye and spirit it did fare, As turning from each common sound and sight Of daily life familiar and dull, I stood within a land whose chastened glow Shone like Reality made beautiful! A world whereon the soft ethereal bow, O'er-arching, rested with a changeful light! II. There, from the casement, fair, as in a dream I watched, with loving eye, that ancient pile Whereon the sunlight lingerëd awhile, From the red west with rich, decaying gleam Of splendour fading in a solemn stream; Then turning, met a soft and pictured smile, Whose imaged sweetness Thought might well beguile From the bright real to the things that seem! Where, graceful peasant, from thy lip and eye Breathed the rich south's soul-kindled witchery— I gazed—and owned, oh wondrous gift! thy part, To shrine an inner life within our care, To fling heaven's kindly sunshine round the heart And lead the dim, earth-darkened spirit there! Durham, March 4, 1847. MARIA ELIZABETH OF PARMA, The first Queen of Joseph II. of Austria. She was the daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, and descended on both sides from the House of Bourbon; an interesting account of the singular story of this Princess is to be met with in Wraxall's Memoirs of the Courts of Europe (vol. ii. p. 387). The Author makes particular mention of a portrait of her, painted by the Archduchess Christina, her sister-in-law, which he saw at the castle of Presburg in Hungary. OR THE PICTURE. “As the Sun “Ere it is risen sometimes paints its image “On the atmosphere, so often do the spirits “Of coming things stride on before their issues “And in to-day already walks to-morrow.” Coleridge's Wallenstein. Thine eyes have long Dwelt on this portrait—they who look on it Return again with an enquiring gaze Unsatisfied, as if upon that brow In its pale loftiness, they sought to trace At once the presage and accomplishment Of mournful destinies, long time fulfilled; For in those dark unfathomable eyes, Whose lustrous sadness meets and answers thine With spiritual meaning, as if yet Their melancholy light revealed the soul, Sorrow doth dimly prophesy itself; And from their liquid depths, they shadow forth An ever-present and unchanging grief Deep hidden in the heart, that long ago Closed over it; nor from its oracles Returned a voice to breathe the tale in words That needed not their aid, but eloquent Wrote its unspoken history, where yet The silent record only doth remain. Rich is the art that thus from Nothingness Redeems the past, and from the silent land Where all things are forgotten, and all forms Shrouded in darkness of the sepulchre, Recalls the aspects that earth knows no more; And through the sweetness of a pictured face, And the soft shadow of a vanished smile, Gives unto Love a link wherewith to bind The scattered fragments of its broken chain, Calling its dim, sweet visions back to life, And thrilling all the stillness of the soul With the deep melodies that woke of yore, But long have died within its solitude; Yet not for Love alone, but unto Thought Thou dost reclaim, imperishable art! A portion in the wreck, the spoil that years Have reaped and gathered to a silent place,— See, how they look upon us from these walls, They that have been so great, so fortunate, That Time, whose course hath swept all meaner names To the cold gulfs of drear oblivion, Hath borne their echo on its downward waves,— Here they abide, that seemed in life to dwell Above the shock of changeful circumstance, Calmly enthroned in their own majesty; Who sat as umpires, 'mid the strife of thought And war of systems, swaying many minds; Yet were themselves then shaken by the storm Of passion, swayed and moulded by the force Of outward influence in ceaseless flow, And ruled unconsciously to good or ill By varying impulse—here they own, at last, The semblance of a life that knows not change; And I have dwelt among them, till their life Quiet and motionless, has grown a part Of my own being, and unto the eye Of age, that hath seen dearer forms depart, They wear the aspect of companionship: But in the still, calm picture-land within, Wherein my spirit walks with Memory, A realm unfolds itself in clearer light Thronged with bright forms—still breathing, beautiful, They move within those Halls of Imagery, As once they walked on Earth, yet on each brow, Pure and immortal, rests a fadeless gleam That shows their being not of earth, but shrined In the calm radiance of undying Thought. I was young, When She, upon whose likeness you have gazed, Came to us from her Southern home, and wore, Among the noble daughters of our house, The aspect of a flower, that hath been nursed To beauty in some far and foreign clime, Yet wreathed among more brilliant blooms, retains Its own peculiar and surpassing grace. Then, through the chambers of this ancient house, And through its silent and deserted halls, Rang youthful voices, and its echoes all Were wakened to prolong the silver sound Of gay and happy laughter, that hath died Upon the lips, and in the altered hearts Whence once it rose, a swift o'erflowing tide, That gushed from bright and ever springing founts Of inner joy—where are those sisters now? Far, far apart! some vanished while the dew Lay yet upon the freshness of their morn, They that Heaven loved and gathered to itself, Ere yet its light had faded from their way; And some have turned to other paths, and own No more the guidance of the friendly stars That shone upon their youth,—estranged from all That then was lovely, by the perilous show, And the unsteadfast splendours of the world, Those days have faded from them like a dream, Yet sometimes, dream-like on their souls return: And One, more noble, more beloved than all— One formed for honour, yet on evil days And evil destinies untimely cast, Pursued by bitter contumely and hate, That breathed their life into the air she drew, And filled it with one dull unceasing cry Of obloquy, that followed where she moved, And flung its shadow 'twixt her and the light, Making it hateful to her eyes, and still Tracked on her steps relentless to the Death. All that she loved torn from her, one by one, No friend, no counsellor, save her high heart and Heaven; Reckoning her age by sorrows, not by years; Marie Antoinette was thirty eight at the time of her execution, and it is recorded that when she stood for trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal, her appearance was that of an aged woman. Her noble and discrownëd head grown white Before its time, her stately form bowed down In the majestic fulness of its prime, Through the strong pressure of grief's wasting hand— She stood—yet never more a Queen than then; And destined from that ordeal to come forth Unscathed, like one on whom the unsparing flames Have passed, but left no record of their breath, Save in the brightness of the gold refined That hath been seven times triëd in the fire. Who saw these things? who read them in the stars? When round their noble Mother The Empress Maria Teresa.—She, whose smile Had roused a nation's chivalry to arms, Whose voice had stirred them like the Trumpetcall That wakes the brave to battle and to die— Thronged all that fair and graceful sisterhood, With her, the young Italian bride, that seemed Herself a mournful Italy, and wore Upon her brow its sadness and its smile; She hath enchained thy fancy! thus, in life By a most nameless witchery, a charm Unconscious, undefinable, she drew All eyes, all hearts to follow where the light Of those dark orbs, so changeful, beautiful Shed on her face the summer of the soul; A Summer soon to cease! e'en then, she moved Among us like a Being seen in dreams, More fair unto our eyes, in that they knew The lovely vision would not linger long. For o'er her beauty—o'er the tender grace That gave to beauty a yet dearer charm, And made it deepen into loveliness— A shadow rested evermore, a cloud That darkened all her Heaven of hope and life; None knew whence it arose—some deemed she drooped, Missing the gardens and the Olive groves Of Italy, and 'neath our colder skies Pined for the azure of that changeless heaven, With all its dower of sunshine and of song, And was it thus? we knew not! as a flower That feels the stealing presage of decay, Withdraws its gentle being from the light, And folds its silken petals to the Sun, She folded all her soul from confidence; And they who loved her, they whom best she loved, Ne'er past the borders of the unseen realm Where evermore she dwelt, with Thought apart, While outward things went by her like a show, An unregarded pageant that she graced But little marked; yet surely on her brow A deeper than the exile's grief abode, Though stirred like his by passionate regrets, And haunted by vague memories, and dreams In which the spirit summons from the Past, All that hath faded from the days that are, All that returns not with the days to come, Sunshine and Summer! they were o'er for her, For the heart mourned its country! it had found, Found early, but to lose, a cherished home; There had it listened to sweet songs, and learnt The language sweeter than all song, that they Who once have heard forget not, though no more It meets their ear, though they must learn to use Far other speech, than that which once of yore In fervent utterance revealed the soul. It had been well with her, had she been born To destinies as lowly as the heart, That asked not grandeur for its happiness; But she, the daughter of a princely house, Must follow other dictates than the voice Whose strong, unerring instinct spoke within— Yet when they came to offer her a throne She strove, in meekness and in reverence To put it from her, saying then in words That were recalled when many years had fled, “Do with me as ye will! yet well I know My days are numbered, and I fain would spend Far from the world that I shall leave so soon, All that remaineth of my life with God. Ye seek to do me honour, yet I feel That I shall never wear the Cæsar's crown.” She did not live to wear it! yet she lived To reign as I have said, o'er many hearts, And be the light, the joy of many eyes, Though she was mournful ever, yet her grief Ne'er weighed on any spirit but her own; It was the moonlight of the soul, that soothed Not saddened by its clear, unshadowed beam; And they that looked upon her smile forgot To grieve it was not mirth, to wish that she In aught were other than the thing she was; For sadness hung around her like a veil Illumined and transpierced with inner light. He, most of all, her Lord that had been deemed So cold and passionless, that in his mind Toiling 'mid cares of empire and of state, No place was left for Love to find a home, Bent now beneath its gentler sovreignty; A spirit lived within her words, wherein The soul spoke forth in music, eloquent, And gave them power to cheat his sterner thoughts Of half their care, and on his lighter moods To shed a charm undreamt of until then; For all her gifts were his, she lived for Him, Still striving gratefully, and not in vain, By an endearing care, a ministering Of watchful tenderness that was not Love, To bless and to requite him for the heart That gave to her that rich and unsought boon. May love be thus requited? may the wealth It pours from all its boundless treasury, Be measured back unto the breast, in coin That does not bear its image superscribed? Or will the heart receive its own again In other than the sweet, unconscious flow, In which it gave its untold riches forth, Free as the utterance of the bird, that pours Its very soul away in song, nor knows What impulse stirs it unto melody? Yet thus it might not be with her; the ties Were early loos'd that bound her unto life, And all the linkëd chain that Earth hath forged, Desire and expectation, fear and hope, To bind our mounting spirits to itself, Seemed to hang on her lightly as the withes That vainly bound the mighty one of yore; And hearing ever in her soul, a voice That called her with a wordless summons hence, No other tone might waken in her heart Response or echo!—but a seeming life Was that she led among us, for her days Wove as they fleeted past a double thread, And while she breathed our changeful air, it seemed As if, as olden mariners relate, Far voyaging amid the Southern seas, A breath had passed upon her from the isles, The Tonga people univers ally believe in the existence of a large Island, the residence of their Gods and of the souls of their departed, and give an account of a Canoe driven by stress of weather upon it. Being in quest of food, and seeing the Country abound with all sorts of fruit, they proceeded to pluck some bread-fruit, but found to their astonishment that they could no more lay hold of it than if it were a shadow; they walked through the trunks of the trees, and passed through the substance of the houses, without feeling any resistance. They accordingly put forth again, and made sail for Tonga, where they arrived with great speed, but in the course of a few days they all died, not as a punishment for having been at Bolotoo, (so the Island was named,) but as a natural consequence of having been there; its air, as it were, infecting all mortal bodies with speedy death.—See Notes to a Tale of Paragnay, Southey's Works, vol. vii. p. 131. Where shadows move within a realm, where all Is shadow! dream-like and impalpable, And they who once have looked upon those flowers And their immortal fruitage, feel their life Drawn from them by the subtle airs, that steal Heavy with strange, sweet odours on the sense, And pass entranced into the Land of Souls. Her spirit dwelt within that Land, though now Earth claimed a dearer portion of her thoughts, For ere her twentieth summer had passed by A child was born unto her. Day by day It grew in infant loveliness and grace, Fair in its Mother's eyes, and they who marked Her soul reveal its tenderness in words Of fond endearing import, in a tone Of sweet unwonted gaiety, would say, “Now wilt thou cease to speak to us as one For whom life owns no Future! thine will look Sweetly upon thee from thy daughter's eyes, She, the beloved one, will give to Earth A dearness it hath never known, and thou Wilt never bear to leave it, leaving her.” Then she made answer, As the Archduchess spoke thus, one of the Ladies of the Court remarked to her, “Est-il donc possible que votre Altesse oublie qu'elle a une fille qu'elle aime tendrement, et peut-elle la quitter avec autant d'indifférence?” “Vous croyez donc,” the Princess answered, “que je vous laisserai ma jeune? oh non! vous ne la garderez tout au plus que six ou sept ans.” This reply appears the more extraordinary, as the child died according to her mother's prediction, at seven years of age.—Wraxall's Memoirs, vol. ii. page 395. while an earnest light Kindled upon her brow, and in her eyes Spoke even deeper meanings than her words, “Think ye that I shall leave her unto you, The darling One? No! though ye love her well, Ye will not keep my daughter from me long; I leave her to you for a few short years, See that ye watch and tend the treasure well.” Then turning to the casement, “Look,” she said, “How fair the Summer shines upon the Earth, And it is Summer also with my life; Yet ere those leaves, that fill the brooding air With light and happy murmurs, from the bough Shall fall discoloured, I shall also fade And wither with them from the Earth—with them To be renewed again, but not by Spring.” So the sweet season passed with all its songs, And as the woods grew silent, and the days Were shortened rapidly, as Autumn came, And threw his regal mantle o'er the Earth, With gold upon the gleaming harvest-plains, And purple on the Vineyards of our hills, Her prophecy but seemed the more remote From its fulfilment, and we surely deemed The closing year would gather in its stores, And spare that richer tribute, for she bloomed In unchanged beauty. Now the season came, When from the Summer palace, Schönbrunn. where the bright, Sweet fountains rise and fall in ceaseless play, She journeyed back unto the Court, to tread Once more the wonted round of state; and passed Along the forest roads, until her train Paused on the hill, from whence the eye looks down On the Imperial City in her pride; The wild autumnal wind sighed moaningly Among the trees, the yellow leaf hung light Upon the bough; and, as the chill breeze swept Across her brow, she seemed in it to greet Some viewless messenger, and, shrinking back, Muttered, as half in answer, “It is Death.” At even, as she sat, her maidens round, Thoughtful within her chamber, an alarm Rang from the clock, that long before the hour Struck loud and rapidly; then, turning pale, “It is the signal calling me away,” She said, and sank upon her knees in prayer. When she arose her cheek was flushed, her eye Burned with a wild and fitful light, her frame Shook with strange tremblings; soon upon her couch They laid her, never to rise up again, For fever ran like lava through her veins, And drank with fiery tongue the springs of life. They watched around her, but she knew them not, She saw them not, her soul was far away,— Reason and consciousness gave way, and through Those broken barriers an o'erwhelming tide Of early memories swept, the flood-gates gone That had so long stemmed in their mastering force; Now in her wild delirium, wave on wave, Each bygone scene, each vanished dream flowed in, And in the music of her native speech, She called aloud on names that once were dear, But had been banished from her lips for years; Yea, banished from her pious heart, that strove To put aside each fond reluctant thought, That would have shrined the idols of the past Within that temple—now they rose once more Like a sweet strain of half forgotten song; Old voices sounded in her ears, the looks That had been loved were round her in that trance, And all the pictures of the soul revived, Undimmed, unchanged—it past, and she with it Past from the Earth for ever. Dost thou ask How this might be, or deem her prophecy Might work its own fulfilment? How this were, I may not answer; in this life of ours Dimly we reason on the things that be Most obvious, to sense most palpable, Yet would we pierce all wonders; some There exist moments in the life of man When he is nearer the great soul of the world Than is man's wont, and possesses freely The power of questioning his destiny.—Wallenstein. have deemed That there are moments when the soul communes Within itself of coming things, and hears Their footsteps move upon their onward way. The Past, the Future, darkly hem us in, We move between two worlds, two worlds, two wondrous worlds, What marvel then if their gigantic shades Should cross each other, shaping on our path A spectral seeming. She could answer us, That looks upon us with such gentle eyes; For she hath past the boundaries of Time, And all that was mysterious is now Revealed to her in light! Mysterious Was she to us!—like some sweet instrument Responding feebly to a stranger touch, But yielding all its chords unto the hand That framed their music with surpassing skill, Her Soul, for Earth too delicately attuned, Hath pass'd to Him to whom its trembling strings Alone might give their hidden sweetness forth! May 4th, 1848. THE BLIND SCHOOL. “The Blind receive their sight,—the poor have the Gospel preached unto them.”—Matt. ii. 5. And is it ours in even this our day, Once more to see the blessed dawn awake On sealed lids—and light with cheering ray From out the darkness break? Surely He dwells among us as of yore, His Spirit works with ours, when science turns From binding fast the elements, and o'er Neglected childhood yearns! And, rescued little ones! ye need not pine In listless weariness the livelong day, Nor count the lingering hours that may not shine Upon your darkened way. Ye never watched the gorgeous hues of morn, Nor marked the chastened splendours evening flings, For you the Sun of righteousness shall dawn, With healing on his wings! It is not yours a mother's smile to trace, Or see her eyes o'erflow with tender dew; In Heaven your angels look upon the face Of One who died for you! Ye may not look upon the harvest-fields, White with autumnal wealth in bounteous store; Ye never knew the gladness spring-time yields, Yet God hath given you more. Prophets and kings have yearned to look upon The things ye see! The Day-spring from on high Arose not glorious where they wandered on— The Saviour was not night! They never knew, the monarch or the sage, Your blissful promise as those fingers trace, Exploring carefully the outspread page, God's oracles of grace. And though the blessed daylight be denied, The living light within, a holy flame, May glow in spirits ransomed, sanctified, The chosen of His name! His word their lamp! more bright than sun or star; Yet though its ray the darkling soul illume, Though Heaven shine on them, radiant from afar, Their Earth is one of gloom, And o'er the path where darkness must abide Still heavily creep on the clouded hours; Let not Love fail their doubtful steps to guide And strew their path with flowers! So when this earthly sun has set for us, May we a light amid our darkness see And hear the words, in shewing kindness thus ye did it unto me! Leamington, Sept. 1845. AUF FRÖHLICHES WIEDER-SEHEN. These words, conveying the assurance of “a sure and certain hope” of re-union with departed friends in a blessed immortality, may be traced on almost every tombstone in Swiss or German churchyards, and form the almost invariable conclusion to their epitaphs, which are very affecting from their singular simplicity—“Sleep softly! dear Brother, (or friend,) until the joyful meeting again!” or, as I once observed in a churchyard of the Bernese Oberland, on a memorial stone erected to an aged pair “by their grateful children,” Schlummert sanft, theure Aeltern, auf frohliches wiedersehen! “To a mysteriously consorted pair, “To death and life, with the affections “That spring from each, this place is consecrate.” “Death hath its two-fold aspect! wintry one, “Cold, sullen, blank—from hope and joy shut out— “The other, which the ray divine hath touched, “Replete with vivid promise, bright as Spring.” Wordsworth. “Sleep softly, dear ones! we shall meet once more;” Here, the red sunlight's brilliant decline, Illumining the high, rock-girdled shore, Where, cradled deep, the lake's clear waters shine, Seems with a golden finger in its wane To trace in holy light, “we meet again.” O hallowed ground! keep well the garnered store That Love hath laid up here in holy trust Until that day when Life shall rise once more In fadeless beauty, kindling from the dust. Faith's duteous tear hath fallen not in vain To raise Hope's shining flower, “we meet again.” Yes! we shall meet, each pang, each struggle o'er, Where never parting word the soul shall grieve, O cherished ones! upon that blessed shore That land where foe cometh not in, nor friend goeth out, for ever! —Archbishop Leighton. Where never foe may enter, friend may leave; Where never tear hath left the trace of pain, Nor sadness marred its greeting “meet again.” How dreary seemed the spirit's solitude When losing you we parted with our all! Yet now our true hearts would not if they could The smiles that make their sunshine here, recall; Ye may not come to us again! more blest Are we to pass to your enduring rest. And we shall meet again! will ye then wear The looks we loved upon this earth so well? Will the voice rise that gives us greeting there As here on earth its kindly utterance fell, Since it hath mingled in the happy song That rises ceaseless from the ransomed throng? Our lips, by heavenly fire unpurified, Have yet to learn that high triumphant strain, Yet must our hearts awhile be proved and tried, Yet must we suffer ere we meet again! Then may it come, the gentle hand and light “But there beyond the grave is nothing else but solace for love! and he who carries us over does it always when we are asleep. So, think how light his hand must be.” The Magic Ring. That guides us sleeping through the vale of night. O but to waken in God's glorious light, To rest serene with perfect souls and true; In the clear shining of the Infinite, Made one in spirit with our Lord and you! Where never sun nor moon hath need to shine, Soul-lighted by the Morning-star divine! There, round our spiritual orb to move, Like stars whose course hath been ordained of old, Revolving in a shining sphere of Love; There, while the everlasting arms enfold, May our hearts join your glad, adoring strain, To Him in whom we meet, nor part again! ADDRESSED TO ? ON HER ASKING FOR SOME VERSES. The Rose once prayed the flowers to twine For her, a scented chaplet fair, That, gemmed with dewy buds, might shine With lustrous leaf and blossom rare; In vain each daughter of the race Was wreathed with bud and silken bell, Not theirs to yield an added grace To beauty that they loved so well! The Nightingale once prayed the train That hung, enraptured, on his lays, That they would wake the warbled strain Of sweetness, vocal to his praise; But vainly strove that tuneful choir, Their notes might but his triumph wrong, In vain might feebleness aspire To sing of Him—the soul of song! And thus, sweet maid, when I recall The charms that unto thee belong, It seems that Nature, giving all, Hath left but little room for Song; Yet would I fain its tribute pay, Did it not seem but mockery To wake for thee the praiseful lay, When thou thyself art Poetry! WRITTEN IN THE BLANK LEAF OF “Proverbial Philosophy.” A gothic temple, where with duteous care, Inwrought in quaint familiar disguise, The symbols shine of holiest mysteries, By antique piety enshrined there, Like golden fruitage set in mouldings fair; A missal, in whose rich illumined dyes Truth shines through vermeil-tinctur'd blazonries; The saintly robes that God's high priest did wear, Where Bell and Pomegranate, in order placed, Spoke hidden meanings to the faithful ear; A vine, with fruit and tendril interlaced, The fitting types of work like this, appear; Where wisdom, thus elaborately graced, Wears her own lineaments, serene and clear. THE SISTERLESS. When will my sister come, dear nurse, Oh! when will my sister come? Will my sister ever come to me To share my little room, To sleep in my little bed at night, And by my side to play? Oh! now when summer is so bright She should not stay away! Why should I have no sister When dear mamma has three? And if I had one, but only one How happy I should be! O nurse, though you may think it wrong, When Aunts came here one day And talked to her so fast and long, With so much to hear and say, I cried when no one saw my face As I sat upon her knee, To think I should have no one, nurse, To be so fond of me; When I was old like them, I thought, How lonely I should be! “You should not think so, Missie, Or say such things to me, For God can raise up friends for you Wherever you may be; Some Children have no kind mothers, Some lose their father too, And some little girls have no brothers To play with them, like you.” But if I had a sister, Nurse, A little angel-child, With golden hair and clear, blue eyes, So innocent and mild, Oh! I would take her in my arms, And set her on my knee, And you should see what a good sister, What a kind one, I should be; Then I would comb each shining curl, And part them from her brow, And tell her to be a dear good girl, As you do to me now. Then I would teach her little prayers, And Bible stories tell, And I think she would love me, dear Nurse, When I loved her so well! But if she came in the winter, Nurse, We would wrap her up so warm, That were it cold as Christmas-time It should not do her harm; If she should come in the winter, When the ground with snow is white, And the rime lays thick upon the pane, And the stars shine out at night, Then I and brothers would be glad! And she should be our star, And we would search within the woods, Where the shining berries are, And bring them in with many a bough To make the nursery gay, And oh! how happy we should be To play with her all day; And by the light of the fire, Nurse, You would tell us tales you know, Of dwarfs and giants fierce that lived With fairies,—long ago— And she would be our fairy, Nurse, So mirthful and so wise, And we would talk to her, and she Would answer with her eyes; And she would stretch her soft, round arms Unto us, with delight, And stroke our faces with her hands So waxen pure and white! We would lay her in the cradle then And rock her unto sleep, And ere we went unto our beds To kiss her we would creep! But if she came in the Spring, dear Nurse, But if she came in the spring, When the winds blow mild from the soft, warm south And the bird is on the wing! If the wind would blow her unto us How happy should we be, When the blossom hangs upon the flow'r, And the bud upon the tree, When the swallow comes across the sea, And the lark is springing high, As if he meant to sing his song To angels in the sky! And to each other the sweet birds At early morning call,— But we should think her little voice Was sweeter far than all! When the yellow Palm is waving light, And the Larch is turning green, And our orchard cherry shines in white As if it were their Queen; When the blue Violet in the grass Hides deep, and does not know How sweet she is, and as we pass We find her hidden low; And from the hedge the Primrose looks With pale and starry eye, And in the fields and by the brooks The golden King-cups lie; Then as the days grew long, dear Nurse, Would we go forth every day, The pleasant pasture lands among Where the merry lambkins play; There we would search about for flowers, Our little lamb to deck, And weave upon her head a crown, And chains around her neck, The purple Orchis, with the Vetch And wood Anemone; But not a flower among them all Would be so fair as she! But if she came in the summer, Nurse, But if she came TO-DAY, She is the only thing we want, All looks so fresh and gay. Now, when the Summer sun rides high, And all is beautiful, It seems so strange that only I, Should feel alone and dull; For Brothers go across the hills And ramble far away, And I that cannot follow them Have no one left to play; I sit upon the garden steps And dream of many things, And watch the Dragon-fly flit past On gauze of silver wings; The birds sing high above my head But I know not what they say, And I wish your fairies had not gone, Dear Nurse, so far away; But if our baby were but here Beside us in the shade, I would not wish a Fairy here Or green Dwarf of the glade, For if THEY saw her angel face There lying in your arms, They would leave some changeling in her place All through their elfin charms; Yes! they would take our baby dear, Through wicked spells away, And we could not spare our little flower To make their garden gay. I would show her where with cool, green leaf The Water-lilies float, With cup of pearl upon the stream, A little magic boat. I would take her where the Foxgloves grow So tall within the dell, And every finger soft and white Should wear a purple bell. Where in the woods the Arum springs, And Honey-suckles weave, And the blue Harebell gently rings Its faint low chime at eve. I would take her where the fields smell sweet With fresh hay laid to dry, The Grasshopper beneath our feet Were not more light than I; The Butterfly that skims in air Were not more glad, more gay— Oh, now that Summer is so fair She should not stay away! And if she came in Autumn, Nurse, It will be coming soon, If we looked the first upon her face By the shining harvest moon; Oh! it would fall upon her bed In silver streams of light, And weave a crown around her head, In lines of dazzling white. Then as she lay the stars would peep Down from the quiet skies And seem to watch her in her sleep, With gentle angel eyes. If she should come in the Autumn, Nurse, It takes so much away, That it should bring her unto us To cheer the shortening day; When ripening on the sunny walls We see the velvet Peach, And from the stalk the Apple falls To lie within our reach; And Filberts cluster over head And cones hang on the Fir, And on the Bramble, berries red And ripe, that wait for her; Then as we walk within the woods No little bird will sing, But in the brake the pheasant broods, With rich and folded wing. Within the broad and golden fields The reapers toil all day, Till heavily the laden wains Creak on their homeward way; If she should come in Autumn, Nurse, The reaper's merry song, As he bears the last well-ripened sheaf In harvest joy along, Would not be half so glad as ours, Would not be half so gay, If Autumn brought her unto us To cheer the shortening day; We should not miss our birds and flowers, Nor wish them back again, And She should never know, dear Nurse, What it is to wish in vain; Or feel what I have felt so long, On this and many a day, O little sister, you do wrong To stay so long away! Romans i. 20. We sate us where the water's lulling sound, Wove deeper o'er the sense the gentle spell That Spring's warm winds called forth, to greet the swell Of bursting life exuberant around; As the young buds, the glancing wave, the ground Were bathed in tender light serene, that fell With changeful radiance o'er stream and dell, And soothed the spirit to a calm profound; The air was full of happy song, and fraught With odorous promise, as its pure breeze sought To woo the bud from its close folded curl; Not yet the Larch its pale fringe might unfurl; The sower sowed his seed in hopeful thought, And the white cloud swam o'er the vault of pearl! WRITTEN IN JENNY LIND'S ALBUM. FROM THE DANISH OF H. C. ANDERSEN. All the bright melodies imprisoned long In Music's World with slumbering echoes rife, It hath been thine! oh childlike Muse of Song, To waken to a fresh, a tuneful life! The lowly grace that would thy gifts disown But makes their sweet unconscious charm more dear; Thy spirit glows not for thine Art alone, But fervent seeks a higher, purer sphere! As from a crystal shell, we quaff the stream Of liquid nectar flowing from thy voice; We thrill, we melt, we tremble in the dream Of ecstasy—we hear Thee and rejoice! ALBUM VERSES. As in a Vase, embalmed in faint perfume, The Summer's radiant gifts a-withering lie, And yield in Death a shadow of the bloom They knew of old, as every odorous sigh Wafts on its breath a record of the grace Their gentle life shed round each silent place; So here in storied light may shine once more The tender gleam that graced a vanished day, Long silent tones be treasured, that of yore Waked gentle music round our youthful way; Her soft unfading hues may MEMORY fling Around Affection's tribute-offering! O may no breath of change, unkind and rude, Pass o'er the blooms to Thought and Fancy dear; No cold neglect, nor chilling doubt intrude The buds of Promise and of Hope to sere;— The heart ne'er mourn its pleasant things laid waste Nor see the pictures it hath loved effaced! May 24, 1847. “REJOICE EVERMORE.” Genesis i. 31. A spirit rests upon our Earth, abiding, though unseen Its soft and gleaming wing may be, we know where it hath been, We hear no sound of rushing plumes, yet feel them where they pass, O'er waving boughs and bursting buds, and light upspringing grass. And we discern in Earth and sky, in all familiar things, A sense, a subtle influence, we know not whence it springs! A gentle presence looks on us with pure and loving face, A mother yearns to fold her sons within a kind embrace. Oh! she is bountiful and rich in costly things and rare, But her sweetest, dearest blessings spring like lilies without care, The sun that shines o'er good and ill, the gentle rains that fall, These are but types of what she gives—a heritage for all. The glory of the silent eve, when all is hushed and still, And golden sunset splendours stream o'er valley and on hill, When broad and deep the shadows fall, and o'er the pearly sky In glory Earth may never match, the clouds go sailing by. Or when the flush of morning breaks in hues undreamt, untold, And light dawns clear upon the world through shrouding mists of gold; These are her pageantries in which each living soul bears part, Her gorgeous shows for every eye, her lessons for each heart. Where shielded for the eye of wealth exotic beauty glows, The chaste Camellia unfolds her pure, unsullied snows, The bright Geranium shines there in rich and crimson pride, And waxen Orange-blossoms hoard their sweetness for the bride. But in the paths we daily tread, and in the poor man's way, The flow'rets lie, whose looks, whose names, are far more sweet than they; The Primrose gem-like, mid its leaves, and she whose heaven-blue eye Repeats the lesson it hath learnt from the pure, changeless sky! There clustering like wreathed pearls, like ocean's foam-white spray, It blooms for every hand and eye, the almond-scented May; Fragrant and wild 'mid bosky dells the faint, pale Woodbines wreathe, And shed their store of honey-dews for all that live and breathe. A palm-like coronet, the Fern waves green 'neath hedgerows lone, The Cherry gleams within the woods, the Chestnut rears its cone; The Furze breaks like an odorous flame o'er waste and upland wold, And o'er each silent, ruined place the Wall-flower scatters gold. And many a humble garden owns the flowers we love the best, Whose aspects weave a gentle spell by every heart confest; Where glowing Pink and queen-like Rose in burning colours vie, And the pale-blossomed Lilac breathes a summer on its sigh. Within the palaces of wealth the song and dance are found, The Viol and the Harp are there, the Lute with silver sound; But Summer sends upon the air a yet more pleasant tune, The slow, sweet murmurs of the bee, the melodies of June; Dim, forest rustlings, light and low, the water's lulling fall, The song of birds, the Ring-dove's plaint, more sad, more sweet than all; In one deep hymn the mighty winds, the chiming billows blend, And in a ceaseless harmony unto their Lord ascend. Yet there are sweeter sounds than these!—the music of the heart That breathes through greetings and farewells when kindred meet and part; Kind voices loved in olden days, that bear upon their tone A message from the happy Past and all that it hath known. Oh! dim must be the deadened eye, and dull the pining thought, That owns not in all things that be, a power with blessing fraught; The Mother-love Chacun en a sa part, et tous l'ont tout entier!”Victor Hugo. that waits around with fond untiring care Where each has all! abounding more, the more her children share. A single taper homeward guides the poor man's toil-worn way, A thousand turn the rich man's night to soft and lustrous day; But LIGHT more blessed shines alike on cottage and on hall, Kind smiles are there, and pleasant words, and the dear, dear love for ALL! St. Barnabas' Day, June 11, 1847. SONGS OF FAREWELL. PARTING. “They that my trust must grow to, dwell not here, “They are, with all my other comforts, “Far hence.” Oh! speak of me, my friends! when I am gone Bind with my name some old familiar strain, That it may bear a greeting on its tone From One, heart-woven with its linkëd chain. For I will speak of you! your names will rise When the full heart would of its treasure tell, And I will seek in stranger looks and eyes To trace the aspects I have loved so well. Oh! think of me, my friends! when I am gone Let not my memory lightly pass away, With pleasant songs forgotten—or as one A stranger-guest, abiding but a day. For I will think of you! a purer ray Will gild Life's journey, flung from times of old, And Thought will reckon o'er, when far away, Their gentle memories—its hoarded gold. Oh! dream of me, my friends! when I am gone, Then be your happy slumbers lightly stirred By tender shadows from the distance thrown, By echoes sweet of some remembered word. For on my visions haunting forms will rise, And I will seek in sleep a clasping hand, And I shall look within those much-loved eyes, Once more, within the pleasant dreaming—land! Oh! pray for me, my friends! when I am gone Still with your voices let my name arise, Where once my accents mingled in the tone Of your sweet hymns and twilight harmonies. For I will pray for you! my spirit lone Will seek the language that its kindred share; Yes! there, beloved friends! when I am gone It will be mine, dear friends, to meet you there! SONGS OF FAREWELL. DEATH. Leaves and clustered fruits, and flowers eterne, Eternal to the world, but not to me. —Hood. The Spring will come again, dear friends, The Swallow o'er the Sea; The bud will hang upon the bough, The blossom on the tree; And many a pleasant sound will rise to greet her on her way, The voice of bird, and leaf, and stream, and warm winds in their play; Oh! sweet the airs that round her breathe! and bountiful is she, She bringeth all the things that fresh, and sweet, and hopeful be; She scatters promise on the Earth with open hand and free, But not for me, my friends, But not for me! Summer will come again, dear friends, Low murmurs of the Bee, Will rise through the long sunny day Above the flowery lea; The deep and dreamy woods will own the slumbrous spell she weaves, And send a greeting, mixed with sighs, through all their quivering leaves. Oh precious are her glowing gifts! and plenteous is she, See bringeth all the lovely things that bright and fragrant be; She scatters fulness on the Earth with lavish hand and free, But not for me, my friends, But not for me! Autumn will come again, dear friends, His spirit-touch will be With gold upon the harvest-field, With crimson on the tree; He passeth o'er the silent woods, they wither at his breath, Slow fading in a still decay, a change that is not Death. Oh! rich, and liberal, and wise, and provident is he! He taketh to his Garner-house the things that ripened be; He gathereth his store from Earth, all silently— And he will gather me, my friends, He will gather me! THE SCENTED CLAY. (FOUNDED ON A PERSIAN FABLE.) Whence dost thou come, thou fragrant thing? From Orient gardens fair, Where odorous urn and chalice fling Their sweetness on the air? Or from the woods, the scented woods, Where gums of healing grow, Or where beneath old ocean's floods The sea-bird's bright tears flow? Or from the spicy isles that lie 'Mid calm and Summer seas, Where evermore the warm winds sigh With low and balm-fraught breeze?” Or from the tombs, where kings of old, In chambers lone and deep, 'Mid many an odour-breathing fold Sleep out their charmed sleep? “Oh! speak not thus to one that lay Long crushed beneath thy hasty feet, Nor flung a perfume o'er thy way To breathe of costly things, or sweet. Until one day, one happy day, It met the gracious Rose, whose pride Held not in scorn the shapeless clay That lay unheeded her beside; It drank her beauty day by day, Her soft and scented sigh it caught, Until within the soulless clay A subtle influence was wrought! Oh gentle one! I did not dream Thy sweetness thus could live in me! Less meanly of myself I'll deem, Since I have won a grace from thee! Since thus thy spirit can embalm What else would all unworthy be, My boast is but to owe each charm, Each borrowed gift, to Love and Thee!” HUMBLE LOVE. THE ROSE AND THE BRIER. “Look not on me, thou wilding Brier, Look not with love on me! Let not thy thought to one aspire So far from thy degree. I am the flowers' bright Queen—the Rose, And reign o'er gardens wide, Where never cruel storm-wind blows To mar my gentle pride. If I am lovely, ask the race For whom my bright hues shine, All beauty, tenderness, and grace, Mit dir vergleichen!”—Herder. They liken unto mine! Whilst thou in wood and lonely lane, In each uncultured place, May'st stretch thine arms abroad in vain, And proffer thine embrace, In vain! all haste to pass thee by, All shun and scorn that see; It seems to do me wrong, that I Should waste e'en words on thee.” “Oh Rose! the pride thy song bespeaks, Doth ill thy state adorn; If love win not the meed it seeks, Repay it not with scorn! Mine is a simple wilding flower, And thine the garden's pride, Yet once, within a fairer bower, We blossomed side by side; And if I owned a blight, sweet Rose, Genesis iii. ver. 17, 18. Alike on thee it fell; Thy fair and fading leaves disclose, A lesson of farewell! Within the sheltered garden air, Thy buds to beauty swell; The freshness of a ruder air, Have nurtured mine as well. No flower within this fairy place That thou dost claim for thine, Can boast a sweeter, wilder grace, Than these pale wreaths of mine! Unto the glad bright sun they all In silent joy look up, And diamond dews at even fall Within each pearly cup. The blessed Sun! he scorneth not On me alike to shine; Oh! thine may be a prouder lot, But not more blest than mine! Mock not affection's faith, fair Rose, All lowly though it be; Look not in haughty scorn on those, Who look with love on thee.” GOD'S GARDEN. FROM THE GERMAN OF ARNDT. “These are thy wonders, Lord of Love! To make us see we are but flowers that glide Which when we once can find and prove, Thou hast a garden for us, where to bide.” “Oh! that I once past changing were Fast in God's Paradise, where no flower can wither!” George Herbert. Earth is a garden fair, Where sweetest flow'rets blend, Our Lord himself with care Its happy blooms will tend; With patient love and true, He watcheth o'er his flowers, And freshens them with showers, With sunshine, and with dew. The sweetest flow'ret there, What may it be but Love? The soother of man's care, The bliss of Saints above— It is the red, red Rose, That must with thorns abide, And see its gentle pride Droop—when the storm-wind blows. The flower that God holds dear, The nighest unto love, Sheds many a blessing here Known but to Him above; Its name is Meekness there, On Earth the Violet sweet Breathes fragrant at our feet, And knows not she is fair! Faith is the third sweet flower, It gives its odorous bloom, Unto a joyless hour, When all beside is gloom; Thus, on the gale of night The Cereus sheds its soul, When clear from Pole to Pole The golden stars shine bright. Sweet Hope! thou art no less God's gentle child and dear, What floweret may express Thy gracious presence here? Thy likeness we may trace, When the pale Snowdrops bring Words from the coming Spring, In soft unspoken grace. And thou, true-hearted flower, The Pansy, called in German, je langer je lieber, “the longer the more dear.” The name of this flower seems sacred in all languages to the utterance of some “gentle and affectionate thought.” Whose bright and cheerful eye Gleams fair through sun and shower, In fearless Constancy; The image thine to bring Of steadfast love, whose power Keeps for each changeful hour Some bloom unwithering! And Thou that lookest down, As with an Angel's mien, With white resplendent Crown, The Garden's peerless Queen— Pure Lily! on thy smile Undimmed by earthly stain, The likeness doth remain Of spirits free from guile. And many a bud and bell, Unnumbered yet and fair, Nurtured and tended well, Hath the Good Gardener there; How hard were it to choose Among their bright array, The happy flower-souls gay, In their sun-coloured hues. And yet if choice were made, Oh Lily! thou wert mine, Pure, as a spirit's shade, Thy radiant petals shine, Thy gaze so meekly fair, Is ever fixed above, As if in yearning love, It sought for kindred there! Oh Thou! the Garden's light, Through whom its blooms endure! Make me unto Thy sight, Make me so white and pure Then may I joyful rise Where reigneth purity, And with the Just and Thee Bloom ever in the skies! ALONE. FROM THE GERMAN OF ARNDT. I am alone—within the world alone— Shut out from Heaven and Hope my star of life, I darkling stem Time's whirling tides alone, Alone within our Being's troubled strife— Alone! the surges of a shoreless main “Der Ocean des Nichts.” Give back the sound to dreary life again. Alone! so soon the smiling Heaven obscured, That shone unclouded on an earlier day, So short a while, kind joys, have ye endured, That wreathed Spring's roses round my youthful way; Oh sad and fearful word! alone! alone! What boding echoes lurk within thy tone. Is Man alone? oh dull and thankless thought! Still flings the sunbeam its unchanging gold, Still blooms the meadow with the hues inwrought, That Eden knew ere yet our Earth was old; Still God hath oracles in leaf and stream, In the flower's glory, and night's starry gleam. Doth not God speak in thee? Yes, when the night Of doubt would bid each happier ray depart, When faithless murmurs wing each arrow's flight, Thy foe would scatter rankling in thy heart, Then God and Love would say, “we are thine own,” With God and Love Thou art no more alone! With God and Love—oh words of hopeful cheer! They hover round, unnumbered spirits blest, To chase away each evil dream of fear— No sullen shadow lingers o'er our rest, To mar the blissful light around us thrown, With God and Love we are no more alone. Oh God and Love! oh Thou, Love's source and stay! Thou Soother of all woes the heart hath borne, Thou that didst rise with Healing on our day, Thou that for me did'st wear the cruel thorn— Oh lamp of Love! within my Being shine, And all on Earth and all in Heaven is mine! BALLAD. “Do ye think of the days that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye wish that the Morn might bring back the time, When your heart and your step were light?” “I think of the days that are gone, Robin, And all that I joyed in then, But the fairest that ever arose on me I have never wished back again.” “Do ye think of the hopes that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye reckon them o'er, as they faded fast, Like buds in an early blight?” “I think of the hopes that are gone, Robin, But I mourn not their stay was fleet, For they fell as the leaves of the red Rose fall, That even in fading are sweet.” “Do ye think of the friends that are gone, Jeanie? As ye sit by your fire at night, Do ye wish they were round you again once more, By the hearth that they made so bright?” “I think of the friends that are gone, Robin, They are dear to my heart as then, But the best and the dearest among them all, I have never wished back again!” GOOD NIGHT. FROM THE GERMAN OF THEODOR KÖRNER. Good night! Let all labours cease with light! Day hath glided to its close, Let the busy hands repose Till the morrow rises bright! Good night! Go to rest! Be weary lids in closing blest! Hush'd to stillness every sound On the watcher's quiet round— Night murmurs low to every breast; Go to rest! Softly sleep! Blissful vision hover deep! By the couch whence peace is driven, By fond love, in dreams from heaven, May the dear One vigil keep! Softly sleep! Good night! Slumber till the morrow's light! Slumber—till the morning breaking Bring fresh care with its awaking; Fearless in the Father's sight, Good night! ON READING MISS WOODROOFFE'S POEMS. PUBLISHED AFTER DEATH. Thine the dower Of a wild native sweetness—like the flower Whose starry eye will bring the thought of thee, In faint, pale loveliness upspringing free, Where the deep holiness of quiet broods O'er forest paths and woodland solitudes; And fading, but to shed a richer breath Where it lies withering in fragrant death. [[I.]] To gaze upon a broad and palmy leaf, Brought far from sunlit lands beyond the sea, And dream how fair and stately were the tree Whereon it waved, the Summer's forest-chief; To hearken to low strains, sad, broken, brief, The mournful breathings of captivity, And think what their triumphal burst might be; To read the Sybil's burning page, with grief, For hidden oracles still left untold— Such dim foreshadowings we fondly trace, As these bright records thy pure dreams unfold, While musing on the spiritual grace That would have clothed them—on the virgin gold Buried with Thee within a silent place! II. But since thy gentle Being was so fair In its clear dawning, and the thought of thee Rests with thine Own, a holy memory, In which no bitterness of Earth hath share; We may not mourn that thou art garnered there, Where the bright things that pure and perfect be, Own through the fulness of Eternity, No breath of change on the etherial air— Nor grieve thy harp is silent, while its swell The burden of a charmëd utterance bore, While yet the murmurs of sweet Fancy's shell Brought lingering echoes from that blissful shore, Where now its music wakens evermore The strains that own not sadness or farewell! June 17th, 1847. A CLEMENCE D?. “To recall the remembrance of the instructions to which we have felt ourselves through life the most deeply indebted, will be, in many instances, to recollect also the excellence, the affection, perhaps the death of those who gave them; amidst the sadness of such a retrospection it will be a consolation to reflect that they are not entirely lost to us; wise monitions thus returning on us, have a more pathetic cogency than when first uttered by the voice of our living friend; yet another benefit is added to the advantages we have received from the beings who have left this world, as we thus reinforce our virtues from the dust of those who first taught them.”—Foster's Essays. [[I.]] Alone, unloved, where none regarded thee, Far from thine own, amid an alien band Thy spirit dwelt, a stranger in a land Where all was unfamiliar, silently— A fountain but to One unsealed and free! No loving eye, no pressure of the hand, Gave thine responsive greeting! thou didst stand In the clear shining of Integrity, Through the sad solitude of mind and heart Upborne by thine own steadfast soul and pure. Thou did'st not claim in France's dower thy part, Nor own her winning sweetness to allure; And they who saw passed coldly by, nor guessed How deep thy store of tenderness represt! II. Since I have looked on thee, my childhood's friend, Or met the greeting of thy quiet eyes, Or heard the upright counsels, kindly wise, That to my half-formed reasonings would bend, Life's dial-finger, hasting to its end Points to a doubled number as it flies; And now a silent gulf betwixt us lies, O'er which in vain would thought its questioning send: How hast thou fared since then! if Time for thee Hath stored an after-sunshine for the way, Care-companied so soon—howe'er this be A blessing Psalm xxxvii. ver. 37. waits upon thy later day, That may not fail, in that on wayward youth Thy spirit left the impress of its Truth! 1847. ISABEL. “A woman of a quiet mind, “Tender and deep in her excess of love.” There, with her Father, by the lonely moor, Dwelt Isabel—her opening girlhood knew No Mother's care, nor owned the tender love That Sisters give; within that old Farm-house No merry voices woke at morn or eve, To stir the old man's pulses with the sound That gives Age back its Youth again to hear; Yet was the Father happy, in the kind And duteous solace of his daughter's care, Who grew up silently, a thoughtful child, That in her yearning for companionship Took to herself for friends the sky, the stars That looked upon her with pure, loving eyes, And spoke a silent language to her ear; The living things it was her care to tend, The Birds, that with sharp cry among the heath Called to each other, had a voice for her Of tones familiar, apprehended half, That made her feel herself the less alone; The moorland flowers, minutely beautiful, Star-like, looked on Her like the stars, and smiled, And the clear stream that welled upon its way From cool green cells, o'ergrown with mosses old, Above its pebbles lifted up a sound Of soothing—murmuring an endless tale. Wide stretched the level moor, nor lacked its range A soft and pastoral charm, with many herds Of grazing kine, that wandered there at will: Far on its verge the flush of morning broke, In crimson splendours tracing out a chain Of hills, upon whose broad and sun-lit slopes Were villages with glittering spires, and halls In folding woods embosomed from the view; While far athwart, a line of gleaming sands Lay northward, and low boomings of the sea Rose on the ear; and in the golden eve Slow sailing past, went by the shining ships, Like phantom vessels pictured in the sky. Here, in a quiet that was more than mirth, Grew Isabel from childhood to the age When Youth is beautiful as is the morn, Whose changeful glory fleets from sun to shade, As if it owned its short-abiding stay, And knew it fading to the silent noon: So she grew on, until the hour when Youth Owns, half unconsciously, the deepening shade Flung on Life's dial from the years to come, With trace of change and trial that they know. And thus the maiden owned within herself More earnest thought, more perfect consciousness, The yearning for a tenderer sympathy Than youth had craved, and in the flowers, the stream, There seemed to rise a tale more eloquent Than they had spoken to her girlish ear. So time wore on, and in his age again Her Father wed, yet made a prudent choice Of one who gave to Isabel the love A faithful elder Sister might have shown; And they went forth together to their work, And in the labours of the house and field Each found a helpmate, strong in heart and hand, To lighten and to sweeten daily toil; And as they lived in quiet and in peace, A child was born unto the house, and he The old man, blessed the son that to his age Brought gladness, and a hope for years to come. And now within the farm-house, where of old Had quiet brooded with unruffled wing, Lulled by the slow, dull tickings of the clock, That seemed a household genius sedate, That told, oracular, its drowsy tale— Awoke the echoes of the heart's first songs, Endearing words of playfulness, that strove In vain to measure forth their tender wealth, To One whose look of infant wonderment Seemed half to question how it were that He, Lying in very helplessness, should prove The common centre of all hearts, the joy Of all within, of all without the house; The light of his old Father's eyes which dwelt On him with anxious watchfulness, as if He were some fairy favour, or a boon That heaven had lent, and might again reclaim. But unto Isabel the child became A holy ark, wherein the vague, sweet thoughts That stirred her heart with troubled tenderness And sent it forth to find no resting place, Might centre and expand in perfect Love. When the long summer came it was her joy To wander with the baby in her arms, And when the mid-day steeped the hills in light And streamed a silver flood upon the sea, To lay him in his slumber on the grass, And wrap him from the sun in heath and thyme, Until he looked a Fairy child, to sleep, Lulled by the droning murmurs of the Bee. And in the night, when all the house had gone Unto their beds, would Isabel arise, And ere she slept herself, would go to kiss Her little Brother as he sleeping lay, Safe pillowed to his warm and rosy rest. And as the baby grew unto a child, He seemed to grow in infant graciousness, As if the love that met his dawning life With welcome, owned a fostering power to bless, And wrought unseen the gentle influence Through which the vernal Flower, dew-nourishëd, Unfolds to the warm sun its opening breast. So grew the child of many prayers, like Him Samuel, chap. i, ver. 17. Who proved how sweet the holiness of youth, Sweet is the holiness of youth.”—Chaucer. In favour growing both with God and man; And soon the sweetness of his lisping tones, With thoughtful meaning fraught beyond his years, Would seem to whisper forth a fond excuse For all their deep idolatry of love; And in his play a tender gaiety That wayward childhood knows not, seemed to dwell, With innocence, and in the angel-eyes So liquid, beautiful, a well of light, Abode a cloudless lustre, that would speak Of things a world like ours hath never known. So years stole on, and found that Family Abiding still in quiet and in love; Until one year, when yellow Autumn brought Again its message of decay and change, The Father, who all day within the field Had bound his sheaves, and looked upon the store That the good season brought, with thankful eye, Came home to sicken, and before those sheaves With joy were garnered at the harvest home, Death gathered him, like Israel of old, A shock of wheat in fulness of his time, Well ripened for the harvest of the grave. And ere the newness of their grief found rest In the strange apathy we feel, as days Roll on, and bring not them we love again; And ere they learned to look no more, with eve To see his stooping form come burthened home; Or ceased, within the twilight, by the fire To see the white hair shining in the gloom, And aged hands spread forth unto the blaze— Ere time had yet returned to the course He must hold on, whate'er he takes away, The mother and her son together struck With fever, lay upon a bed that proved Of death to one, and she was carried forth To rest beside her husband in his grave. “And must he follow too?” thought Isabel, The trembling watcher o'er a doubtful strife; “Must he too follow?” then her heart gave way In one long burst of agony and pain, That called on them who might return no more; And on the bed she flung herself, and said, “We two are left alone; oh, little one! And they that loved us rest within their graves;” But as she raised her head, she heard his breath Come soft and regular, and now his lip Half parted, reddened with the dew of health; Then Isabel knelt down, and prayed to God With many tears, and gave Him thanks, and said “I bless thee, Father, in that thou hast left A comfort to my spirit in its grief.” Then as her heart grew strong within itself She looked around with heedful care, and took Account of all that might remain to them; And when she found that now, her father gone, They could not hold the farm, then Isabel Took earnest counsel with herself, and said “My brother shall not have to labour on, Like him that is departed, all his life Eating the bread of carefulness and toil, With early rising, and late taking rest, And all to keep off iron-handed want, But I will work both for myself and Him, And hold together what is left, that when He comes to man's estate, his hand may find Its labour not his only portion here;” And so she gave the child, with many prayers, With blessings, and with kisses, and with tears, Unto the keeping of an aged pair, Who dwelt beside the Farm, from youth till now In kindness living with her Father's house: And Isabel went forth to eat the bread Of service, that some wealthier kindred gave, And she, who like the Shunamite of old, Had dwelt among her own, and done her work Unbidden, as it liked her, now became Obsequious, with eye that strove to catch The import of a wish before it rose, Anticipating duty ere command, In all things studious to show herself A servant careful for her master's good, In singleness of heart, as one who owned The service of a Master in the heavens; And they were kind, and she was well content, Or would have been, but for the haunting thoughts That flung the shadow of the face she loved Across her way, and to her quiet toil Brought troubling echoes of a childish voice. But with the early Spring, there came a day, With leave for her to spend a little space Beside her little brother on the moor, And there she found him happy, growing still, As he had grown, in favour and in love; And they went forth together on the moor, And looked upon the lambs that pastured there, And saw the sun light up the distant hills And stream, a silver flood, upon the sea; Then on the furrowed shore they stood, and saw The shining ships, slow sailing, pass them by, And heard the mighty tumult, as the tide Brought the slow curling wave unto their feet, And the boy clapped his little hands, and held His sister by the gown, and screamed aloud, In the strange gladness of a fearful joy; And as they wandered home with footsteps slow, She sang to him, and told him many tales Of Saints and holy children dear to God; And time fled past on swift unsullied wing, That quickly brought the hour of parting round, Then she arose, and took her leave with prayers, With blessings, and with kisses, and with tears, And went back to her work with thankful mind. But now as months wore on, o'er Isabel A sadness stole, a trouble without name, That in the labours of the house and field Stirred her with flutterings of vague unrest, And thrilled her pulse with unembodied fears; And her soul sickened with a deep desire, A longing like to that the Switzer feels To see once more his mountain home, to hear The dashing of the torrent from the rock, And drink the ice-cool breeze before he dies; And in the quiet house, and in the field Her ear was quick to catch unreal sounds, And seeming voices calling her by name; And when she slept, a little arm was drawn Around her neck, a hand was clasped in hers, A soft cheek pillowëd upon her own,— And when she woke her face was wet with tears, And rest forsook her through the livelong night— So she besought her mistress, that once more Although so distant from the promised day, Her step might lead her where her heart abode With the sole treasure that it owned on earth. So Isabel set forth before the dawn, A patient pilgrim, and the summer's day Found her unwearied on her onward path, Upborne by feelings lightened, though perturbed, And all unconscious of the tedious way In fervent onward-lookings to its end. Once, when the mid-day sun was high in heaven, She met a glad refreshment in the looks Of one she knew, a neighbour and a friend, Who stayed his horse, and looked at her surpris'd, And said, “Where go you, Isabel; I go To L—., and thought that I should find you there;” And she replied, “I go unto the moor To see my brother, tell me, is he well? How was he looking when you saw him last? But the man answered hastily and strange; “I have not seen the child of late, farewell! Heaven prosper you upon your onward way!” And paused awhile, but ere her voice arose In further greeting, hastened on his way. And Isabel, in walking onwards, thought It strange that He, her old companion, Should pass her thus, but soon all thought gave way, All thought, all feeling merging into one; For now as daylight's soft decline drew on, She stood, and heard the murmur of the waves, And saw the sunset glow upon the hills, And stream, a silver flood, upon the sea; She saw, yet marked them not, for now her eye Dwelt where her heart had dwelt with him so long. And as she drew unto the house, her pulse Grew quick with joy, as with light foot she stole On towards the open door, with thought to reach Its portal unperceived, perchance to hear Her name repeated in his evening prayer: But all was silent! and she heard the clock, Her Father's clock, creep on its drowsy tale, Far, far behind the beatings of her heart; She looked within, and saw the aged pair That sat together silent by the fire, With eyes that rested vacant on the flame, As if they sought to trace out meanings there; And now they heard her enter, and looked round Without a gesture of surprize or joy, To give an answer to her greeting words, A strange misgiving seized her, and the words “Oh hath aught happened! is my brother ill?” Broke quickly from her lips, but with a slow Perturbëd utterance the answer fell; “Oh Isabel, did you not meet our friend? And did not He?”....“Oh! tell me all,” she cried, In agony, “Oh tell me what is this!” And their lips trembled, yet no sound arose, And their eyes fixed themselves on hers, and then Turned, as by instinct, on the curtained bed. There lay her little brother as to sleep, And on his waxen brow, his lip, and eye, Abode the peace of a serene repose. Around his forehead lay a living wreath The Summer Rose and bright Geranium, That shed a solemn halo round his rest; And gathered closely round his form, and drawn Unto his chin, were garments whose strange white Smote on her spirit, when she saw their folds Unstirred by any breath, then Isabel Fell on her face, and knew her brother dead; And through the stillness of that quiet room Arose a sound of agony and pain, A voice of lamentation, whose wild tones Called on His name who might return no more, “But to have seen thee once, yet once again!” And all was silent in the heart that mourned Its hope and treasure taken from the Earth. Then Isabel arose with thought to kiss Her brother in his slumber, as of yore, But as she bent above Him, on those lips So wan and ashen, and upon his brow, Abode the spirit of a deep repose; And, as he lay, his sunken features wore The look they wore upon his mother's knee; Of something that this world hath never known, Of peace its troubled course can neither give Nor take away—of love unspeakable, Of perfect rest, and of a blest return Unto a home where they had smiled before. Then Isabel knelt down and prayed to God, With many tears, and gave him thanks, and said, “I thank thee, Father, in that thou hast left A comfort to my spirit in its grief.” April 27th, 1847.</field>
