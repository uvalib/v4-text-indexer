In Dauids house, his seruaunte true, According to his minde: And also hys annoynted king, As we in Scripture finde. As by his holy Prophetes all, Oft times he did declare: The whiche were since the worlde began, His way for to prepare. That we might be deliuered, From those that make debate: Our enemies, and from the handes, Of all that doo vs hate. The mercy whiche he promised, Oure fathers to fulfill: And thinke vpon his couenant made, According to hys wyll. And also to performe the othe, Whiche he before had sworne: To Abraham our father deare, For vs that were forlorne. That he woulde geue him self for vs, And vs from bondage bringe: Out of the handes of all our foes, To serue our heauenly kyng. And that without all maner feare, and eke in righteousnes? and also for to leade our life, In stedfast holynes. And thou (o child) which now art borne and of the Lorde elect: Shalt be the Prophet of the hiest, His wayes for to direct. For thou shalt goo before his face, For to prepare his wayes: and also for to teache his will, and pleasure all the dayes. To geue th? knowledg, how that theyr Saluation is nere: and that remission of theyr sinnes, Is through his mercy mere. Wherby the day spring, from an hie, Is come, vs for to visit: and those for to illuminate, whiche doo in darknes syt. To lighten those that shadowed be, with death and eke opprest: and also for to guide theyr fete, The way to peace and rest. The songe of Blessed Mary, called Magnificat. My soule doth magnifye the Lord, My sprit eke euermore, Reioyseth in the Lorde my God Which is my Sauior, &amp; why? because he did regard, &amp; gaue respect, vnto, So base estate of his handmaid, And let the mightie go. For now beholde all nations, And generations all: From this time forth for euermore, Shall me right blessed call. Because he hath me magnifyed, Which is the lorde of might: Whose name be euer sanctifyed, And praysed day and night. For with his mercy and his grace, All men he doth inflame: Thorowout all generations, To suche as feare his name. He shewed strength with his great arme And made the proude to start: With all imaginations, That they bare in theyr hart. He hathe put downe the mightye ones. From their supernall seate: And did exalte the meke in hart, As he hath thought it mete. The hungrie he replenished, With all thinges that were good: And through his power he made the riche, Oft times to want their fode. And, calling to remembraunce, His mercy euery dele: Hath holpen vp assistantly, His seruaunt Israell. According to his promise made, To Abraham before: And to his sede successiuely, To stande for euermore. The song of Simeon, called Nunc dimittis. S. O Lord because my harts desire hath wished long to see, my only Lord &amp; sauiour thy sonne before I die, the ioye and health of all mankind, desired long before, which now is come in to the worlde of mercy bringing store. Thou sufferest thy seruaunt now, In peace for to depart: According to thy holy word, Which lighteneth my hart. Because mine eies, whiche thou hast made, To geue my body light: Haue now behelde thy sauing health, Which is the Lord of might. Whom thou mercifully hast set, Of thine aboundant grace: In open sight and visible, Before all people face. The Gentils to illuminate. And Sathan ouer quell: And eke to be the glory of Thy people Israell. The Crede of Athanasius. N. What man soeuer he be that, saluation will attayne, the catholike belefe he muste before all thinges retayne, which faith vnles he holy kepe, and vndefiledly, without al doubt eternally, he shalbe sure to dye. The Catholike belefe is this. that God we worship one, In Trinitie and Trinitie in vnitie alone. So as we neyther doo confound, the persons of the three, Nor yet the substance whole of one In sunder parted be. One person of the father is, an other of the Sonne, An other person propre of the holy Ghost alone. Of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost but one the Godhed is, Like glory, coeternall eke the maiestie likewise. Suche as the father is, such is the Sonne in eche degree, And suche also we do beleue the holy Ghost to be. Nncreat is the Father, and vncreat is the Sonne, The holy Ghost, vncreate: so vncreat is eche one. In comprehensible Father is, Incomprehensible Sonne, And comprehensible also is The holy Ghost of none. The Father is eternall, and the Sonne eternall so, And in like sort eternall is, the holy Ghost also. And yet though we beleue that eche of these eternall be: Yet there but one eternall is, and not eternals three. As ne incomprensible we, ne yet vncreat three, But one incomprensible, one vncreat holde to be. Almightie so the father is, the sonne almightye so, And in like sort almightye is the holy Ghost also, And albeit that euery one of these almightie be: Yet there but one almightie is, and not almighties three. The Father God is, God the Sonne, God holy Ghost also: Yet are there not three Gods in all, but one God and no mo. So likewise Lorde the Father is, and Lorde also the Sonne, And Lord the holy Ghost: yet are there not three Lordes, but one. For as we are compeld to graunt by Christian veritie, Eche of the persons by himselfe both God and Lord to be. So Catholick religion forbiddeth vs alway That eyther Gods be three, or that there Lordes be three to say. Of none the father is, ne made ne creat, nor begot: The Sonne is of the Father, not creat ne made but got. The holy Ghost is of them both, the father and the Sonne, Ne made, ne creat, nor begot, but doth procede alone. So we one Father hold, not three: one Sonne also not three: One holy Ghost alone, and not three holy Ghostes to be. None in this Trinitie before, nor after other is: Ne greater any then the rest, ne lesser be likewise. But euery one amonge themselues, of all the persons three: Together coeternall all, and all coequall be. So vnitie in Trinitie, as said it is before: And Trinitie in vnitie in all things we adore. Therfore what man so euer that saluation will attayne: This faith touching the Trinitie: of force he must reteyne. And nedefull to eternall life it is that euery wight Of the incarnating of Christ our Lord beleue a right. For this the right faith is, that we beleue and eke beknow, That Christ our Lorde the son of God, is God and man also, God of his fathers substaunce, got before the world began: And of his mothers substance, borne in worlde a very man. Both perfect God and perfect man in one one Iesus Christ That doth of resonable soule, an humane flesh subsist, Touching his Godhed egall with his father God is he. Touching his manhed lower then his father in degree. Who though he be both very God and very man also: yet is he but one Christ alone and is not persons two. One not by turning of Godhed into the flesh of man: But by taking manhod to God this beyng one began, All one, not by confounding of the substance into one: But onely by the vnitie that is of one persone. For as the reasonable soule and flesh but one man is: So in one persone God and man is but one Christ like wise. Who suffred for to saue vs all to hell he did descend: The third day rose agayne from dead, to heauen he did ascend. He sittes at the right hand of God thalmightie father there: From thence to iudge the quick and dead againe he shall retire. At whose returne all men shall rise with bodies new restorde: And of theyr owne workes they shall geue accompt vnto the Lorde. And they into eternall lyfe shall go that haue done well, Who haue done ill shall go into eternall fire to dwell. This is the catholike belefe, who doth not faithfully Beleue the same, without all dout, he saued can not be. To Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, all glory be therfore, As in beginning was, is now, and shalbe euermore. The Lamentation of a Sinner. M. O Lord turn not away thy face, fr? him that lieth prostrate: Lamenting sore his sinfull lyfe, before thy mercy gate: Which gate thou openest wide to those that doo lament, their sinne, shut not y? gate against me lord, but let me enter in And call me not to mine accompts How I haue liued here: For then I know right well (O Lorde) How vile I shall appere. I nede not to confesse my lyfe, I am sure thou canst tell: What I haue ben, and what I am I know thou knowest it well. O lord thou knowest what things be past And eke the thinges that be: Thou knowest also what is to come, Nothing is hid from thee, Before the heauens &amp; earth were made: Thou knowest what thinges were then: As all things els that hath bene since, Among the sonnes of men. And can the thinges that I haue done, Be hidden from thee then: Nay, nay, thou knowest them all (O Lord) Where they were done and when, Wherfore with teares I come to thee, To begge and to entreat: Euen as the child thht hath done euill, And feareth to be beat. So come I to thy mercy gate, Where mercy doth abound: Requiring mercy for my sinne, To heale my deadly wound, O Lorde I nede not to repete, What I doo beg or craue: Thou knowest (O Lorde) before I aske, The thing that I would haue. Mercy good Lorde mercy I aske, This is the totall summe: For mercy Lorde is all my sute, Lorde let thy mercy come. The humble sute of the Sinner. M. O Lorde of whom I do depend be holde my carefull hart, &amp; when thy wil &amp; pleasure is relese me of my smart, thou seest my sorowe what they are, my gref is knowne to thee &amp; there is none y? can remoue, or take the same fr? me. But only thou whose ayde I craue, whose mercy still is prest To ease all those that come to thee for souccour and for rest. And sith thou seest my restles eyes. my teres and greuous grone, Attende vnto my sute, O Lorde, Marke well my plaint and mone, For sinne hath so inclosed me, and compast me aboute: That I am now remediles if mercy helpe not out. For mortall man, cannot release, or mitigate thys payne: But euen thy Christ, my Lord and God, whiche for my sinnes was slayne. Whose blody woundes are yet to see, though not with mortall eye: Yet doth thy sainctes beholde them all, And so I trust shall I. Though sinne doth hynder me a whyle, When thou shalt see it good: I shall enioye the sight of him and see his woundes and bloud And as thine angels and thy saynctes, doo now beholde the same: So trust I to possesse that place, With them to prayse thy name. But whiles I liue here in this vale, where sinners doo frequent: Assist me euer with thy grace My sinnes still to lament. Lest that I treade in sinners trace, and geue them my consent: To dwell with them in wickednes wherto nature is bent Only thy grace must be my staye lest that I fall downe flat, And being downe, then of my selfe cannot recouer that. Wherfore this is yet once againe, my sute and my request To graunt me pardon for my sinne that I in thee may rest. Then shall my hart, my tong and voyce, be instruments of prayse And in thy Churche and house of sainctes, Sing psalmes to thee alwayes. The Lordes Prayer, or Pater noster. Our father which in heauen Our father which in heauen art, lord halowd be thy name, Thy kingd? come, thy will be don in earth, euen as the same in heau? is. Geue vs (O Lord) our dayly bread this day: As we forgeue our detters so, Forgeue our dettes we pray. Into temptati? lead vs not, From euill make vs free, for kingdome, power and glory thyne, bothe now and euer be. The, x. Commaundements. Audi Israell. Exod. xx. N. Hark Israel, &amp; what I say, geue hede to vnderst?d. I am the lord thy God, y? brought thee out of Egipt land, euen fr? the house wherin thou didst in thrald? liue a slaue. Non other gods at all before my presence shalt thou haue. No maner grauen image shalt thou make at all to thee. Nor any figure like by thee shall counterfayted be, O fany thing in heauen aboue, nor in the earth belowe, Nor in waters beneth the earth, to them thou shalt not bowe. Nor shalt them serue. The Lorde thy God, a ielous God am I, That punish parents faultes vnto the third and fourth degree, Upon their children that me hate: and mercy doo display To thousands of suche as me loue and my precepts obey. The name thou of the Lorde thy God, in vayne shalt neuer vse. For him that takes his name in vayne, the Lorde shall not excuse. Remember that thou holy kepe, the sacred Sabbat day: Sir daies thou labour shalt, and doo thy nedefull workes alway. The seuenth is set by the Lord, thy God to rest vpon. No worke shalt thou doo in it, ne thou, nor yet thy sonne, Thy daughter, seruaunt, nor handmayd, thine oxe, nor yet thine asse Nor straunger that within thy gates hath his abiding place. For in six dayes God heauen, and earth, and all therin did make, And after those his rest he did Upon the seuenth take, Wherfore he blest the day that he for resting did ordayne, And sacred to him self alone apointed to remayne. Yeld honor to thy parentes, that prolonged thy dayes may be, Upon the land, the which the Lord thy God hath geuen thee. Thou shalt not murther. Thou shalt not commit adulterye. Thou shalt not steale, nor witnes false against thy neighbour be. Thou shalt not couet house that to thy neyghbor doth belong, Ne couet shalt in hauing of his wyfe to doo him wrong: Nor his man seruaunt, nor his mayde, nor oxe, nor asse of his: Nor any other thing that to thy neighbor proper is. FINIS. PSALMES OF DAVID. Beatus vir. Psalme. i. T.S. Whether it was Esoras, or any other that gathered the Psalmes into a booke: it semeth he did set thys Psalme firste in maner of a Preface, to exhorte all godly men to study and meditate the heauenly wisdome, for theffecte herof is, that they be blessed that geue them selues wholy all their life to Gods lawe: And that the wicked contemners of God, though they seme for a whyle fortunate, yet at lengthe shall come to miserable destruction. 1 The man is blest that hath not bent, to wicked rede his eare: nor led his life as sinners do nor sat in scorners chair. 2.But in the law of god y? lord, both set his whole delight, &amp; in that law doth exercise, him selfe both day &amp; night. 3He shall be like the tree that groweth, fast by the riuer side: Whiche bringeth forth most pleasant fruite. in her due time and tide. Whose leafe shall neuer fade nor fall, But florish still and stand: Euen so all thinges shall prosper well, that this man taketh in hand. Although the wicked seme to beare the swing in this worlde yet the lorde scattereth them like chaffe with a blaste of his mouthe. 4So shall not the vngodly men, they shalbe nothing so: But as the dust which from the earth, the windes dryue to and fro. 5Therfore shall not the wicked men, in iudgement stande vpryght: Nor yet the sinners, with the iust, shall come in place, or sight. 6For why? the way of Godly men, vnto the Lorde is knowne: And eke the way of wicked men, shall quyte be ouerthrowen. Quare fremuerunt gentes. Psalm. ii. T.S. Dauid reioyseth, that notwithstanding hys enemies rage, &amp; worldely power, yet God wil continue hys kyngdome for euer, and adua?ce it euen to the for most ende of the worlde. And therfore be exhorteth kinges and rulers, that setting vayne glory apart, they would humbly submit themselues vnder Gods yoke. Herein is signified Chryste and hys kyngdome. Sing this psalme with the first tune [1] Why did the Gentiles tumultes raise, what rage was in their braine? Why dyd the Iewish people muse, seyng all is but vayne? 2The kinges and rulers of the earth, conspire and are all bent: Against the lord and Christ his sonne, which he among vs sent. 3Shall we be bounde to them say they? let all theyr bondes be broke: In heb, greate ropes or cables And of their doctrine and theyr lawe, let vs reiect the yoke. 4But he that in the heauen dwelleth, their doinges will deride: And make them all as mocking stockes, throughout the worlde so wyde. 5For in his wrath the Lorde will say, to them vpon a day: And in his fury trouble them, and then the Lorde will say. 6I haue anoynted him my kyng, upon my holy hyll: I will therfore Lorde preach thy lawes. and eke declare thy will. 7For in this wise the Lorde him selfe, did say to me I wotte, Thou art my deare and only sonne, to day I thee begotte. 8All people I will geue to thee, as heires at thy request: The endes and coastes of all the earth, by thee shall be possest. 9Thou shalt them bruse euen with a mace, as men vnder foote trode: And as the potters sheardes shalt breake, them with an yron rodde. 10Now ye, O kinges and rulers all, be wise therfore and learnde: By whom the marters of the world, be iudged and discernde. 11Se that ye serue the Lorde aboue, in trembling and in feare: Se that with reuerence ye reioyse, to him in like manere. 12Se that ye kisse and eke embrace, his blessed sonne I say: Lest in his wrath ye sodenly, perish in the midde way. 13If once his wrath neuer so small, shall kindle in hys brest: Oh then all they that trust in Chryst, shall happie be and blest. Domine quid multiplicati. s?t. Psal. iii. T.S. Dauid being persecuted, &amp; driuen out of his kingdome by his owne sonne Absalom was greatly tormented in minde for hys sinne against God: and therfore calleth vpon God, and waxeth bolde through hys promises, against the great terrors, of his enemies: yea, and againste deathe it selfe, whyche he sawe present before hys eyes. Finally he reioyseth for the good successe and victory, that God gaue hym and all the Churche ouer hys enemies. [1] O Lord how are my foes increast, which vexe me more &amp; more, [2]They kil my hart when as they say, God c? him not restore, [3]but thou, O Lord, art my defence, wh? I am harde bestead: my worship &amp; my honor bothe, and thou holdst vp my hed. 4Then with my voyce vpon the Lorde, I did bothe call and cry: And he out of his holy hill, did heare me by and by. Gods strength muste not be measured by manes weakenes, and therfore we ought to feare no daungers. 5I layde me downe, and quyetly, I slept and rose agayne: For why? I know assuredly, The Lorde will me sustayn, 6If ten thousande had hemde me in, I could not be afrayde: For thou art still my Lorde my God, my sauiour and mine ayde. He retorneth to hys prayer 7Rise vp therfore, saue me my God, for now to thee I call: For thou hast broke the cheekes and teeth, of these wicked men all. 8Saluation only doth belong, to thee, O Lorde aboue: Thou doest bestowe vpon thy folke, thy blessing and thy loue. Cum inuo carem exaudiuit. Psal. iiii. T.S. Wh? Saule persecutid Dauid. he called vp? God, trusting most assuredly in his promise, &amp; therfore boldli reproueth his enemies, who by wilfull malice resisted his dominion. And fynally preferreth the fououre of God before all worldly treasures. Let vs lykewyse learne to trust in Gods promises, wh? we are afflicted with any kinde of Crosse and so we shall neyther feare our enemies, nor yet be ouer commen with tentations. Sing this as the firste Psalme. [1] O God that art my righteousnes, Lorde heare me when I call: Thou hast set me at liberty when I was bonde and thrall: God will delyuer hys church fr? all dangers, because he fauoureth it. Selah. [2]Haue mercy Lorde therfore on me, and graunt me this request: For vnto thee vncessantly, to cry I will not rest. 3O mortall men, how longe will ye my glory thus despise? Why wander ye in vanitie, and folow after lyes? 4Knowe ye that good and godly men, the Lorde doth take and chuse: And when to him I make my plaint, he doth me not refuse. 5Sinne not, but stande in awe therfore, examine well your heart: And in your chambre quyetly, see you your selues conuerte, 6Offer to God the sacrifice, of righteousnes I say: And loke that in the liuing Lorde, you put your trust alway. 7The greater sort craue worldly goodes, and riches doo embrace: But Lord graunt vs thy countenaunce, thy fauour and thy grace. 8For thou therby shalt make my hart, more ioyfull and more glad: Then they that of their corne and wine, full great increase haue had. 9In peace therfore lie downe will I, taking my rest and slepe: For thou onely wilt me, O Lorde, alone in safety kepe. Verba mea auribus percipe. Psal. v. Th. Stern. Dauid hauing suffered greate calamitie, as well by Doeg and Achitophell Sauls flaterers, as by other infinit enemies, calleth to God for succor, shewing howe requisite it is, That god shuld punish the malicious enuye of hys aduersaryes. After beyng assured of prosperous successe, he conceiueth comforte: concluding, that when God shall deliuer him, other also shall be partakers of the same mercyes. Sing this as the thirde Psalme. [1] Inclyne thyne eares vnto my wordes, O Lorde my playnt consider. 2And heare my voyce my kyng my God, to thee I make my prayer. 3Heare me betime, Lorde, tary not, for I will haue respect, My prayer early in the morne, to thee for to direct. 4And I will trust through patience, in thee my God alone: That art not pleasd with wickednes, and ill with thee dwelleth none. The wicked can not escape Gods punishment, who wil iudge all the worlde. 5And in thy sight shall neuer stande. these furious fooles, O Lorde: Uaine workers of iniquitie, Thou hast alwayes abhorde, 6The liers and the flatterers, thou shalt destroy them then: And God will hate the bloud thirstye, and the deceitfull man. In the depest of his t?ptations he putteth hys full confydence in God. 7Therfore will I come to thy house, trusting vpon thy grace: And reuerently will worship thee, toward thine holy place. 8Lorde leade me in thy rightuousnes, for to confounde my foes: And eke the way that I shall walke, before my face disclose, 9For in their mouthes there is no truth, theyr hart is foule and vayne: 10Their throte an open sepulchre, their tonges doo glose and fayne, 11Destroy their false conspiracies, that they may come to nought: 12Subuert them in theyr heapes of sinne, which haue rebellion wrought. 13But those that put theyr trust in thee, let them be glad alwayes: And render thankes for thy defence, and geue thy name the prayse. 14For thou with fauour wilt increase, the iust and righteous still: And with thy grace as with a shilde, defend him from all ill. Heb that will crowne hym. Domine in furore tuo arguas me. 1. Psal. vi. T.S When Dauid by hys sinnes hathe prouoked Gods wrathe, &amp; nowe felt not only hys hand against hym, but also conceyued the horrors of deathe euerlastyng: he desireth forgeuenes, bewayling that if God toke him away in hys indignation. he shoulde lacke occasion to praise him as he was wonte to doo whilest he was amongest men. Then so deinly felyng Gods mercy, he sharpely rebuketh his enemyes, which reioyseth in hys afliction. [1] Lord in thy wrath reproue me not though I deserue thyne ire: Ne yet correcte me in thy rage, O Lorde I thee desire. [2]For I am weake therfore O Lorde of mercy me forbeare, and heale me Lorde: for why thou knowest my bones do quake for feare. 3My soule is troubled very sore, and vexed vehemently But Lorde how long wilt thou delay to cure my miserie? 4Lord, turne thee to thy wonted grace, my sely soule vp take: Oh saue me, not for my desertes, but for thy mercies sake. 5For why? no man among the dead, He feared not so muche the death of the body but trembled as it wer for fear of gods iudgement, &amp; so waxed dim and cold not praise God. remembreth thee one whit: Or who shall worship thee (O Lorde) in the infernall pit? 6So greuous is my plaint and mone, that I waxe wonderous faint: All the night long I wash my bed, with teares of my complaint. 7My sight is dymme and waxeth olde, with anguishe of mine hert Heb. mine eye is eaten as, with wormes. For feare of those that be my foes, and would my soule subuert. 8But nowe a way from me all ye, God sendeth comfort &amp; boldenes in affliction. that worke iniquitie For why? the Lord hath heard the woyce, of my complaint and crye. 9He heard not onely the request, and praier of my heart. But it receiued at my hande, and toke it in good part. 10And nowe my foes, that vexed me, the Lord will sone defame. And sodenly confunde them all, to theyr rebuke and shame. Domine deus meus in te speraui. Psal. vii. T.S. Dauid being falsely accused by Chus, one of Sauls kinsmen, he calleth to God to be hys defender. to whom he commendeth hys innocency. Firste shewyng, that hys conscience dyd not accuse hym of any euyll towards Saule. Next that it touched gods glory to awarde sentence against the wicked. And so entring in to the consideration of Gods mercies and promises he waxeth bolde, &amp; derideth the vaine enterprises of his enemies, threatning that it shall fall on theyr owne necks. that which they haue purposed for others. Sing this as the thirde Psalme. [The first parte.] [1] O Lorde my God, I put my trust, and confidence in thee: Saue me from them that me pursue. and eke deliuer me: 2Lest like a Lyon he me teare. and rent in pieces small: While there is none to succor me, and rid me out of thrall. Wherewith Chus chargeth me. He reioyseth that God only hath aproued hys cause. 3O Lorde my God If I haue done, the thyng that is not ryght: Or ells if I be found in faut, or giltie in thy syght. 4Or to my frend rewarded euyll, or left him in distres. Which, me pursued most cruelly, and hated me causeles. A sygne of a pure consci?ce. 5Then let my foes pursue my soule, and eke my life downe thrust, Unto the earth, and also lay, myne honour in the dust. Selah. 6Stert vp, O Lord, now in thy wrath, and put my foes to payne. Performe thy kingdome promised, to me whyche wrong sustayne. 7Then shall great nations come to thee and know thee by this thing: If thou declare for loue of them, thy selfe as Lorde and king. 8And thou that art of all men iudge, As touchyng my behauor towardes Saul and mine enemyes. O Lorde now iudge thou me, According to my rightousnes. and mine integritie. The second parte. 9Lorde cease the heart of wicked men, and be the iust mans guide. 10By whom the secretes of all hartes, are searched and descride. 11I take my helpe, to come of God, in all my grief and smarte: That doth preserue all those that be, of pure and perfect heart. 12The iust man, and the wicked bothe, God iudgeth by his poure: So that he feleth his mighty hand, euen euery day and houre. He derideth Sauls enterprises, beyng surely perswaded to be preserued by Gods fauour. 13Except he chaunge his mind, I die, for euen as he should smite, He whet his sword his bow he bendth, ayming where he may hit. 14And doeth prepare his mortall dartes, his arrowes kene and sharpe: For them that doo me persecute, The wicked seme to [illeg.] of child till they haue c?fessed their [illeg.]. whilest he doth mischief warps. 15But loe, though he in trauell be, of his deuelish fore cast. And of his mischief once conceiued, yet bringeth forth nought at last. The wicked m? is beat with his owne rod. 16He digth a ditche, and delueth it depe. In hope to hurte his brother: But he shall fall into the pit, that he digde vp for other. 17Thus wrong retorneth to the hurt, of him in whom it bread: And all the mischief that he wrought, shall fall vpon his head. 18I will geue thankes to God therfore, that iudgeth rightuously: And with my song prayse will the name, of hym that is most hye. Domine Deus noster. Psal. viii. Tho. Ster. The Prophet considering thexcellent liberalitie, and fatherly prouidence of God towards man. whom he made as it were a God ouer all his workes, doth not only geue great thanks, but is astonished with thadmiration of the same: as one nothinge hable to compasse suche greate mercies, and so endeth. Sing this as the thirde psalme. [1] O God our Lord how wonderfull, are thy workes euery where: Whose fame surmounte in dignitie, aboue the heauens cleare. 2Euen by the mouthes of sucking babes, thou wilt confound thy foes: For in these babes thy might is sene, thy graces they disclose. 3And when I see the heauens highe, the workes of thine owne hand: The Sunne, the Mone, and al the Starres. in order as they stand. 4What thing is man (Lorde) thinke I then, that thou doest him remember: Or what is mans posteritie, that thou doest it considre. 5For thou hast made him litle les, Herein appeareth the greate loue of god toward man. Hebr. 2. then Angels in degree: And thou hast crowned him also, with glory and dygnitie. 6Thou hast preferd him to be Lorde, of all thy workes of wonder, And at his fete hast set all thinges, that he should kepe them vnder. 7As shepe and neat all beastes els, that in the fieldes doo fede: 8Foules of the ayre, fishe in the sea, and all that therin brede. 9Therfore must I say once agayne, O God, that art our Lorde: How famous and how wonderfull, are thy works through the world. Confitebor tibi domine in toto. Psalm. ix. T.S. After he had geuen thankes to God, for the sundry victoryes that he had sent hym against his enemies, and also proued by manifolde experience howe ready God was at hande in all hys troubles: he beyng now likewise in daunger of new enemies, desireth God to help hym accordyng to hys wont, and distroye the malicious arrogancie of his aduersaryes. Sing this as the .iii. ps. [The first parte.] [1] With hart and mouthe, vnto the Lorde, will I syng laude and prayse: And speake of all thy wondrous workes, and them declare alwayes. 2I will be glad and muche reioyce, in thee (O God) moste hie: And make my songes extoll thy name, aboue the sterry skie. 3For that my foes are driuen backe, and turned vnto flyght: They fall downe flat and are destroyd by thy great force and might. God only def?deth the iuste cause.Thou hast reuenged all my wrong. my grief and all my grudge, 4Thou dost with iustice heare my cause, most like a righteous iudge. 5Thou doest rebuke the Heathen folke, and wicked so confounde, That afterwarde, the memory, of them cannot be founde. 6My foe, thou hast made good dispatche and all our townes destroyed: Thou hast theyr fame with th? defaced through all the world so wyde. 7Know thou that he whiche is aboue, for euermore shall raygne: And in the seate of equitie, true iudgement wil mainteyne. 8With iustice he wyll kepe and guyde, the worlde and euery weight: And so will yelde with equitie. to euery man his right. 9He is protector of the poore, what tyme they be opprest: He is in all aduersitie, their refuge and theyr rest. 10All they that know thy holy name, therfore shall trust in thee: For thou forsakest not theyr sute, in their necessitie. 11Sing Psalmes therfore vnto the Lorde, We seke God, there by prayer or by vpright &amp; godly lyfe. that dwelleth in Sion hill: Publishe amonge all nations, his noble actes and will. 12For he is mindfull of the bloud, of those that be opprest: For getting not the afflicted hart, that seketh to him for rest. The second parte. 13Haue mercy Lorde on me poore wretche, whose enemies still remayne: Which from the gates of death are wonte, to rayse me vp agayne. 14In Sion that I might set forth, thy prayse with hart and voyce: And that in thy saluation (Lorde) my soule might still reioyce. 15The heathen sticke fast in the pit, that they them selues preparde: And in the net that they did set, their owne fete fast are snarde. 16God sheweth his iudgement which wer good The hebr. willeth men to meditate dilygently on thys thynge. for euery man to marke: When as ye see the wicked man, lye trapt in his owne warke. 17The wicked and the sinfull men, go downe to hell for euer: And all the people of the worlde, that will not god remember. 18But sure the Lorde will not forget, the poore mans grief and payne: The pacient folke neuer loke, for helpe of God in vayne. 19O Lorde arise lest men preuayle, that be of worldly might: And let the Heathen folke receyue, their iudgement in thy sight. 20Lord stryke such terror feare and dread into the harts of them: That they may know assuredly, they be but mortall men. Vt quid domine. Psalme. x. T.S. He complaineth of the fraude, rapine, tiranny, and of all kindes of wrong, which worldly men vse, assigninge the cause thereof, whiche was that wicked men beinge as it were dronken with worldly prosperitie, and therfore setting aparte all feare and reuerence towardes God, thinke they may doe all thinges without controwlinge Therfore he calleth vppon God to sende some remeady agaynst these desperate euyls. And at length comforteth him selfe with hope of deliuerance. Sing this as the thirde Psalme. [1] What is the cause that thou (O Lorde) art now so sarre from thine? And kepest close thy countenaunce, from vs this troublous time? 2The poore doth pearysh by the proude, and wicked mens desire: Let them be taken in the craft, that they themselues conspire. 3For in the lust of his owne hart, the vngodly doth delite: So doth the wicked praise hym selfe, and doeth the Lorde despite. 4He is proude that right and wrong, he setteth all apart: Nay, nay, there is no God (sayeth he) for thus he thinketh in hart. 5Because his wayes do prosper still, he doth thy lawes neglect: And with a blast doth puffe against, suche as would him correct. 6Tush, tush (saieth he) I haue no dread, lest mine estate should chaunge: And why? for all aduersitie, to him is very straunge. 7His mouth is full of cursednes. He meaneth that wickednes is so far ouergrow? that God must nedes nowe helpe or neuer. of fraud, deceyt, and guyle: Under his tong doeth mischief syt, and trauell all the whyle, 8He lyeth hid in wayes and holes, to slay the innocent. Against the poore that passe him by, hys cruell eyes are bent. 9And like a Lyon priuely, lieth lurking in his den: If he may snare them in his net, to spoyle poore simple men. 10And for the nonce full craftely, he croueheth downe I say: 11So are greate heapes of poore men made, by his strong power, his pray. 12Tush God forgetteth this (sayeth he) therfore may I be bolde: His countenance is cast aside, he doth it not beholde, 13Arise (O Lorde) O God in wome, the poore mans hope doth rest: Lift vp thy hand, forget not Lorde, the poore that be opprest, 14What blasphemy is thys to thee? Lorde dost thou not abhorre it? To heare the wicked in theyr hartes, say, tushe thou carest not for it? 15But thou seest all thys wickednes, and well doest vnderstande: 16That frendles and poore fatherles, are left into thy hande. By the Heathen he meaneth the Hypocrites whyche gloryed as yf they had bene of the churche. 17Of wicked and malicious men, then breake the power for euer: That they with theyr iniquytie, may pearish altogether. 18The Lorde shall raine for euermore, as king and God alone: And he will chase the Heathen folke, out of hys lande eche one. 19Thou hearest (O Lord) the poore mans plaint, theyr praiers &amp; request: Their harts thou wilt confirme vntyll thine eares to heare be prest. 20To iudge the poore and fatherles, and helpe them to their right: That they may be no more opprest, with men of worldly might. In Domino confido. Psalm. xi. T.S. This Psalme conteyneth two partes. In the firste Dauid shewed how hard assaultes of temtations he susteyned, and in howe great anguish of mind he was, when Saul did persecute hym. Then nexte he reioyseth. that God sent hym succor in his necessitie declaryng his iustice, as wel in gouernyng the good and the wicked men as the whole worlde. Sing this as the third Psalme. [1] I trust in God, how dare ye then, say thus my soule vntill: Flee hence as fast as any foule, and hide you in youre hyll. 2Beholde the wicked bende theyr bowes, and make their arrowes prest: To shote in secret and to hurte, the sound and harmeles brest. 3Of worldly hope and stayes were shrunke and clearly brought to nought: Alas the iust and rightuous man, what euill hath he wrought. 4But he that in his temple is, most holy and most hye: And in the heauens hath his seate, of royall maiestie. The poore and simple mans estate, All thinges are gouerned by gods prouid?ce. considereth in his minde: And searcheth out full narowly, the maners of mankinde. 5And with a cherefull countenaunce, the rightuous man will vse: But in his harte he doth abhorre, all suche as mischief muse. 6And on the sinners casteth snares, as thicke as any rayne: As in the distruction of Sodom and GomoFire and brimstone, and whirle windes thicke appoynted for theyr payne. 7Ye see then how a righteous God, doeth righteousnes embrace: And to the iust and vpryght man, sheweth forth his pleasant face. Saluum me fac Deus. Psalm. xii. T.S. The Prophet learnyng the miserable estate of the people. and the decaye of all good order, desyreth God spedely to sende succor to his children: Then comfortyng himselfe &amp; others with thassuraunce of gods helpe: he commendeth the constant veritye that God obserueth in keping his promises, concluding that when all orders are most corrupted, then will God delyuer hys. Sing this as the third psalme. [1] Helpe Lorde, for good and godly men, doo perysh and decay: And fayth and truth from worldly men, is parted cleane away. 2Who so doeth with his neighboure talke, his talke is all but vayne: For euery man bethinketh how, to flatter, lye and fayne. 3But flatteryng and deceitfull lippes, and tounges that be so stoute: To speake proud words, &amp; make great bragges the Lorde soone cut them out, 4For they say still, we wyll preuayle, our tonges shall vs extoll Oure tonges are ours, we ought to speake, what Lorde shall vs controll? The lord doth deliuer from all daungers. 5But for the great complaint and cry, of poore and men opprest: Arise will I now (sayeth the Lorde,) and them restore to rest. 6Gods worde is lyke to siluer pure, that from the earth is tried: And hath no les then seuen times, in fire bene puryfyed. 7Now since thy promise is to helpe, God can not deceue them that put theyr trust in him. Lorde kepe thy promise then: And saue vs now and euermore, from this ill kinde of men. 8For now the wicked world is full, of mischief manifolde: When vanitie with mortall men, so highly is extolde. Vsquequo domine. Psalme. xiii. T.S. Dauid (as it were) ouercomen with sundry and new afflictions, fleeth to God as his onely refuge, and so at the length being encouraged through Gods promises he conceyueth moste sure confidence againste the extreame horrors of deathe. Sing this Psalm with the .iii. tune. [1] Howe longe wilt thou forget me (Lorde) shall I neuer be remembred? How long wilt thou thy visage hide, as though thou were offended. 2In hart and mynde how longe shall I. with care tormented be? Howe longe eke shall my deadly foe, thus tryumphe ouer me? 3Beholde me now (my Lorde) my God, and heare me sore opprest: Lighten mine eyes lest that I slepe, as one by death possest. 4Lest this mine enemie sai to me, beholde I doo preuayle: Lest they also that hate my soule, reioyce to see me quayle. The mercye of God is the cause of our saluation. 5But for thy mercyes and goodnes, my hope shall neuer start: In thy relife and sauing health, right glad shall be my hart. 6I will geue thankes vnto the Lorde, and prayses so hym syng: Because he hathe hard my request, and graunted my wishyng. Dixit in sipiens. Psalme. xiiii. T.S. He described the peruerse nature of men, whiche were so growen to licenciousnes, that God was brought to vtter c?tempt for the which thing although he was greatly greued: yet being perswaded that god would send som present remedy, he comfort him selfe and others. [1] There is no God, as folish m? affirm in their mad mode: their drifts ar al corrupt and vain, not one of th? doth good. [2]The lord beheld fr? heauen hie y? whole race of m?kind and saw not one y? sought in dede y? liuing god to find. 3They went all wide and were corrupt, and truely there was none: That in the worlde did any good, I say, there was not one. 4Is all theyr iudgement so farre lost, that all worke mischief styll: Eatyng my people euen as breade, not one to seke Gods wyll, 5When they thus rage, then sodenly, great feare on them shall fall: For God doth loue the rightuous men, and will maintayne them all. 6Ye mocke the doinges of the poore, to theyr reproche and shame? Because they put theyr trust in God, and call vpon hys name. 7But who shall geue thy people health, Where wicked men raine, all felicitie is but very slauery, lyke to Egipte or Babilon. and when wilt thou fulfill: The promise made to Israell. from out of Sion hill. 8Euen when thou shalt restore agayne, suche as were captiues lad: Then Iacob shall therin reioyse, and Israell shall be glad. Domine quis habitabit. Psalm. xv. T.S. This Psalme teacheth on what condition God did chuse the Iewes for his peculiar people, and wherfore he placed his Temple amonge them, whyche was to thentent, that they by liuing vprightly &amp; godly, might witnes that they were his speciall and holy people. Sing this as th .xiiii. Psa. [1] O Lorde within thy tabernacle, who shall inhabite styll? Or whom wilt thou receyue to dwell. in thy most holy hill? 2The man whose lyfe is vncorrupt, whose workes are iust and streit: Whose hart doth thinke the very truthe, whose tong speaketh no deceyt. 3Nor to his neyghboure doth none ill, in body goods, or name: Nor willingly doeth moue false tales, which might empere the same. 4That in hys hart regardeth not, malicious wicked men: But those that loue and feare the Lorde, he maketh muche of them. 5His othe and all his promises, that kepeth faithfully: Although he make his couenaunt so, that he doth lose therby, Them the which doo not this shalbe cast out of the church with Ismaell and the hipocrites. 6That putteth not to vsury, hys money and hys coyne: Ne for to hurt the innocent, doeth brybe or els purloyne. 7Who so doeth all thynges as you see, that here is to be done: Shall neuer perish in thys world, nor in the worlde to come. Conserua me domine. psalm. xvi. T.S. Dauid prayeth to God for succor, not for hys workes, but for hys faithes sake, protestyng that he hateth all Idolatry, takyng God only for hys comforte and felicytie: who suffereth hys to lacke nothing. Sing this as the .xiiii. psal [1] Lorde kepe me for I trust in thee, and doo confesse in dede: Thou art my God, and of my good, O Lorde, thou hast no nede. 2I geue my goodnes to the sainctes, that in the worlde doo dwell: And namely to the faithfull flocke, in vertue that excell. 3They shall heape sorowes on their heds which runne as they were mad: To offer to the Idols gods, alas it is to bad. 4As for theyr bloudy sacrifyce, He would neyther by outeward professi? nor in hart consent with Idolatryes. and offringes of that sort: I will not touch, nor yet therof, my lippes shall make report. 5For why? the Lorde the portion is, of mine inheritaunce: And thou art he that doest mainteyne, my rent my lot, my chaunce, 6The place wherin my lot did fall, in beauty did excell: Mine heritage assigned to me, doth please me wondrous well. The faithful ar sure to perseuer to the ende. 7I thanke the Lorde that caused me, to vnderstand the right: For by his meanes my secreat thoughtes, do teache me euery nyght. 8I set the Lorde still in my sight, and trust in him ouer all: For he doth stande on my ryght hand, therfore I shall not fall. 9Wherfore my hart and tong also, doeth bothe reioyse together: My fleshe and body rest in hope, when I this thyng consider. That is to say, hys lyfe. 10Thou wilt not leaue my soule in graue, for Lorde, thou louest me, Nor yet will geue thyne holy one, corruption for to see. Where god fauoreth there is perfit felicitie. 11But wilt teache me the way to lyfe, for all treasures and store: Of perfect ioy are in thy face, and power for euermore. Exaudi domine iustitiam meam. Psal. xvii. T.S Here he complayneth to god of the cruel pride and arrogancye of Saule, and the rest of his enemies, who thus raged withoute anye cause geuen on his part: therfore he desireth God to reuenge his innocency and deliuer him. This Psalm ought diligently to be noted of suche as receiue euell, for well doyng. Sing this as the .xiiii. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] O Lorde geue eare to my iust cause, attend when I complaine: And heare the prayer that I put forth with lippes that doo not fayne. 2And let the iudgement of my cause, procede alwayes from thee: And let thyne eyes beholde, and cleare thys my simplicitie, 3Thou hast well tryed me in the night, and yet couldst nothyng fynde: That I haue spoken with my tonge, that was not in my minde. 4As from the workes of wicked men, and pathes peruerse and ill: For loue of thy most holy worde, I haue refrayned styll. 5Then in thy pathes that be most pure, stay me (Lorde) and preserue: That from the way wherin I walke, my steppes may neuer swerue. 6For I doo call to thee (O Lorde) surely thou wylt me ayde: Then heare my prayer &amp; way right wel the wordes that I haue sayde. 7O thou the sauiour of all them, that put theyr trust in thee: Declare thy strength on th? that spurn, against thy maiestie. 8O kepe me (Lord) as thou wouldst kepe the apple of thine eye: And vnder couert of thy winges, defend me secretly. The seconde parte. 9From wicked men that trouble me, and dayly me anoy: Ind from my foes that go about, my soule for to destroy. 10Whiche wallow in their worldly wealth, so full and eke so fat: That in theyr pride they do not spare, to speake they care not what. Meaning him selfe and his c?panyons. 11They lye in wayte where we should passe with craft me to confounde: And musing mischief in their mindes, to cast me to the grounde. 12Muche lyke a Lyon gredely, that would hys praye embrace: Or lurking like a Lyons whelpe, within some secrete place. 13Up Lorde with hast preuent my foe, and cast hym at thy feete: Saue thou my soule from the euil man, and with thy sworde him smite. 14Deliuer me Lorde by thy power, out of these tyrantes handes: Whiche nowe so longe time raigned haue. and kepe vs in theyr bandes. 15I meane from worldly men, to whom all worldly goodes are ryfe: That haue no hope nor part of ioy, but in this present lyfe. Thou of thy store, theyr bellies filst, with pleasures to their minde: Theyr children haue inough, and leaue, to theirs the rest behinde. 16But I shall with pure conscience, beholde thy gratious face: So when I wake I shalbe full, with thine image and grace. Diligam te domine. psal. xviii. T.S. This Psalme is the fyrste beginnyng of Dauids saluation and thancks geuing in the entring into his kingdome, wherin he extolleth, and praiseth most highly, the maruelous mercies and grace of God, who hathe bothe preserued and defended hym: he setteth forthe the Image of Christes kingdome, painted in hys kindom: that the faithful mai be assured, that Christe shall alwayes conquere and ouercome by the vnspeakable power of hys father, though all the whole world shuld say there against. [The first parte.] [1] O God my str?gth and fortitude, of force I must loue the: Thou art my castell &amp; defence in mine necessitie. [2]My god my rock in wh? I trust y? worker of my wealth, my refuge buckler &amp; my shield, y? horn of al mi health 3When I sing laud vnto the Lorde, most worthy to be strued: Then fro my foes I am right sure, that I shalbe preserued. 4The panges of death did compas me, and bounde me euery where: The flowing waues of wickednes. did put me in great feare. 5The slie and suttell snares of hell, were round aboute me set: And for my death there was preparde, a deadly trapping net. 6I thus beset with payne and gryef, did pray to God for grace: And he forthwith did heare my playnt, out of his holy place. 7Suche is hys power that in his wrath, he made the earth to quake: Yea the foundation of the mounte, of Basan for to shake. 8And from his nostrels came a smoke, When kindled was his ire: And from his mouth came kindled coles, of hote consuming fire, 9The Lorde descended from aboue, and bowde the heauens hie: And vnderneth his fete he cast, the darknes of the skye. 10On Cherubs, and on Cherubins, full royally he rode: and on the winges of all the windes, came fliyng all abrode. The second parte. And like a denne most darke he made, his denne and secret place: With waters black and ayrie cloudes, enuironed he was. 12But when the presence of his face, in brightnes shall appeare: Then cloudes consume &amp; in their stead, come hayles aud coales of fyre. 13These fiery dartes and thunder boltes, disperse them here and there: And with his often lightninges, he puttes them in great feare. 14Lorde at thy wrath and threatenings, and at thy chyding cheare. The springes and the foundations, of all the worlde appeare. 15And from aboue the Lorde sent downe, to fetche me from belowe: And pluckt me out of waters great, that would me ouerflowe. 16And me deliuered from my foes, that would haue made me thrall: Yea from such foes as were to strong, for me to deale with all. 17They did preuent me to oppres, in time of my great gryef: But yet the Lorde was my defence, my succor and relief. 18He brought me forth in open place, where as I might be free: And kept me safe because he had, a fauor vnto me. 19And as I was an innocent, so did he me regarde: And to the cleanes of my hands. he gaue me my reward. 20For that I walked in his wayes, and in his pathes haue trod: And haue not wauered wickedly, against my Lorde my God. The third parte. 21But euermore I haue respect, to his law and decree: His statutes and commaundementes, I cast not out fro me. 22But pure and cleane and vncorrupt, appearde afore his face: And did refrayne from wickednes, and sinne in any case. 23The Lorde therfore will me reward, as I haue done aright: And to the cleannes of my handes, appearing in hys sight. 24For Lorde with him that holy is, wilt thou be holy to: And with the good and vertuous men, right vertuously wilt doo. 25And to the louing and elect, thy loue thou wilt reserue, And thou wilt vse the wicked men, as wicked men deserue. 26For thou dost saue the simple folke, In trouble when they lye: And dost bring downe the countenance of them that loke full hie. 27The Lorde will light my candell so, that it shall shine full bryght: The Lorde my God will make also, my darknes to be light. 28For by thy helpe an host of men, disconfite (Lorde) I shall: By thee I scale and ouerleape, the strength of any wall. 29Unspotted are the wayes of God, his worde is purely tryed: He is a sure defence to suche, as in his faith abide, 30For who is God? except the Lorde, for other there is none: Or els who is omnipotent, sauing our God alone? The forthe parte. 31The God that girded me with str?gth, is he that I doo meane: That all the wayes wherin I walke, did euermore kepe cleane. 32That made my feete lyke to the hartes, in swiftnes of my pace: And for my suertie brought me forth, into an open place 33He did in order put my handes, to bataile and to fyght: To breake in sunder barres of bras, he gaue my armes the myght. 34Thou reachest me my sauing health, thy right hand is my tower: Thy loue and familiaritie, doeth styll encrease my power. 35And vnder me thou makest playne, the waye where I should walke: So that my feete shall neuer slippe. nor stumble at a balke. 36And fiersely I pursue and take, my foes that me annoyed: And from the field doo not retorne, till they be all destroyde. 37So I suppresse and wound my foes, that they can rise no more: For at my seate they fall downe flat, I strike them all so sore. 38For thou dost gird me with thy strength to warre in suche a wyse: That they be all scatred abroade, that vp against me ryse, 39Lorde thou hast put into my handes my mortall enemies yoke: And all my foes thou dost deuide, in sonder with thy stroke. 40They calld for help but none gaue eare, to helpe them with reliefe: Yea to the Lorde they callde for helpe, yet hearde he not their grief. The fifth parte. 41And styll lyke dust before the winde, I driue them vnder feate: And swepe them out lyke filthy claye, that stinketh in the streat. 42Thou kepest me from sedicious folke, that still in stryfe be led: And thou doest of the heathen folke, apoint me to be hed. 43A people straunge to me vnknowen, and yet they shall me serue: And at the first obey my word, wheras mine owne will swarue. 44I shalbe ircksom to mine owne, they will not see my light: But wander wide out of theyr wayes, and hide them out of sight. 45But blessed be the lyuyng Lorde, most worthy of all prayse: That is my rocke and sauing health, praysed be he alwayes. 46For God it is that gaue me power, reuenged for to be: And with his onely worde subdued, the people vnto me. 47And fro my foe me deliuered, and set me hier then those: That cruell and vngodly were, and vp against me rose. 48And for this cause, O Lorde my God, to thee geue thankes I shall? And syng out prayses to thy name, among the Gentils all. 49That gauest great prosperitie, vnto the kyng I saye: To Dauid thy anoynted kyng, and to his seede for aye. Cœli enarrant gloriam dei. Psalme. xix. T.S. To the intent he might moue the faithfull to a deper consideration of Gods glory, he setteth before theyr eyes the most exquisite workem?ship of the Heauens, with theyr proportion and ornamentes. And afterwarde calleth them to the law wherin God hath reueled hymselfe more familiarly to his chosen people. The whiche peculiar grace by commending the lawe, he setteth foorth more at large, and at thende, he concludeth with a Prayer. Sing this as the .xiiii. psalme. [1] The heauens and the firmament, doo wonderously declare: The glory of God omnipotent, his workes and what they are. 2The wonderous workes of God apere by euery dayes successe: The nightes, which likewise theyr race run the self same thinges expresse. Roma. x.d. actes. xiiii, c. 3There is no language, tong, or speach, where theyr sounde is not heard: 4In all the earth and coastes therof their knowledge is conferd. In them the Lorde made for the sunne, a place of great renome: 5Who like a bridegrome ready trimde, doth from hys chamber come. And as a valiaunt champion, He noteth thre excellent qualyties in the s?ne his beautie, sweftnes and heate. who for to get a pryce: With ioy doth hast to take in hande, some noble enterprise. 6And all the skie from ende to ende, he compasseth about: Nothyng can hide it from his heat, but he will finde it out. 7Howe perfect is the law of God, how is his couenaunt sure? Conuerting soules and makyng wyse, the simple and obscure. 8Iust are the Lordes commaundim?ts, Mans inuentions are croked, without c?fort, filthy and blind and glad both hart and mynde: His precept pure and geueth light, to eyes that be full blynde. 9The feare of God is excellent, and doth indure for euer: What so euer mans fantasye doth inuent, is but lyes, and vanitie. The iudgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether. 10And more to be embraste alwayes, then fined golde, I say: The hony and the hony combe, are not so swete as they. 11By them thy seruaunt is forewarnde, to haue God in regarde: And in performance of the same, there shalbe great rewarde. 12But lord what earthly man doth know the errours of hys lyfe? Then clense my soule from secreat sinnes, whyche are in me most ryfe. 13And kepe me that presumptuous sinnes, preuayle not ouer me: And then shall I be innocent, and great offences flee. 14Accept my mouth and eke my hart, my wordes and thoughts echone: For my redemer and my strength, O Lorde thou art alone. Exaudiat te dominus. Psal. xx. T.S. A prayer of the people vnto God: that it woulde please hym to heare theyr king: and receyue his sacrifice, whyche he offred before he went to battell against the Ammonites, declaryng howe that the Heathen put theyr trust in horses &amp; chariotes, but they trust only in the name of the Lorde theyr God. Wherfore the other shall fall, but the Lorde will saue the kinge and hys people. Sing this as the .xiiii. psal [1] In trouble and aduersitie, the Lorde God heare thee styll. The maiestye of Iacobs God, defende thee from all ill. 2And send thee from his holy place, hys helpe at euery nede: And so in Sion stablish thee, and make thee strong in dede. 3Remembring well the sacrifice, that now to him is done: And so receyue right thankfully, thy burnt offringes echeone. 4Accordyng to thy hartes desire, the Lorde graunt vnto thee: And all thy counsell and deuyse, full well performe may he. 5We shall reioyse when thou vs sauest, and our banners displaye: Unto the Lorde whyche thy requestes, fulfilled hathe alwaye. 6The Lorde will his annoynted saue, I know well by hys grace: And send him health by his right hand out of his holy place: 7In charets some put confidence, and some in horses trust: But we remember God our Lorde, that kepeth promise iust. 8They fall downe flat, but we doo ryse, and stand vp stedfastly: 9Now saue and helpe vs, Lorde &amp; king, on thee when we doo cry. Domine in virtute. Psalme. xxi. T.S. Dauid in the parson of the people prayseth God for the victory which he gaue them against the Siri?s and Ammonites .i. Sam .x.xi. wherin he had the riche crowne of the king of Ammon set vpon his head .ii, Sam .xii. and was indued with the manifolde blessinges of God, and contrarywise his enemies destroyed. [1] O Lord how ioyfull is the king, in thy str?gth, &amp; thy power: how vemently doeth he reioyce in thee hys sauior. [2]For thou haste geuen vnto him his godly harts desire: to hym nothing hast thou denide of that he did require. Dauid did not onely obtayne lyfe, but also assurance that his posteritie shold raigne for euer. 3Thou didst preuent hym with thy gyftes, and blessynges manifold: And thou hast set vpon hys head. a crowne of perfect golde. 4And when he asked life of thee, therof thou madst hym sure: To haue longe lyfe, yea suche a lyfe, as euer should indure. 5Greate is hys glory by thy helpe, thy benefyte and ayde: Greate worship and greate honor bothe, thou hast vpon hym layde, 6Thou wylte geue hym felycytie, that neuer shall decay: And with thy chearefull countenaunce, wylt comforte hym alway. 7For why the kinge doeth strongly trust, Hereof he describeth the strength of christes kingdome against thenemies therof. in God for to preuayle: Therfore hys goodnes and his grace, will not that he shall quayle. 8But let thyne enemies fele thy force, and those that thee withstande: Finde out thy foes, and let them fele, the power of thy right hande. 9And like an ouen burne them Lorde, in firie flame and fume: Thine angre shall destroy them all, and fyre shall them consume. 10And thou wilt roote out of the earth, their frute that should increase, And from the number of thy folke, theyr seede shall ende and cease. 11For why? muche mischief did they muse, against thyne holy name: Yet did they fayle and had no power, for to performe the same. 12But as a marke thou shalt them set, in a most open place: And charge thy bowstringes readily, against thyne enemies face. 13Be thou exalted Lorde therfore. in thy strength euery houre: So shall we sing right solempnely, praisyng thy might and power. Deus deus meus respice. Psalm. xxii. T.S Dauid complayneth hymselfe to be broughte into suche extremities, that he is like a man desperate &amp; past al hope, after declareth wherof, he recouereth himself from the botomles pit of temptations. And vnder his owne parson he setteth forth the figure of Christ, wh? he dyd forsee in the spirite of prophecye. So this Psalme after two sortes doth declare that prophecye of Esay: he was taken forth of prison and iudgemente. Sing this as the .xxi. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] O God my God, wherfore doest thou, forsake me vtterly: And helpest not when I doo make, my greate complaynte and cry. 2To thee my God euen all day longe, I doo bothe crye and call? I cease not all the night and yet, thou hearest not at all. 3Euen thou that in thy sanctuary, and holy place dost dwell: Thou art the comfort and the ioye, and glory of Israell, 4And he in whom our fathers olde, had all theyr hope for euer: And when they put their trust in thee, So diddest thou them deliuer. 5They were delyuered for euer, when they called on thy name: And for the fayth they had in thee, they were not put to shame. 6But I am nowe become a worme, more like then any man: And outcast whom the people scorne, with all the spite they can. 7And me despise as they beholde, me walking on the waye: They gren, they mowe, they nod theyr heads, and in this wyse they faye, 8Thys man did glory in the Lorde, his fauore and his loue: Let him redeme and helpe hym nowe, his power if he will proue. 9But Lorde out of my mothers wombe I came by thy request: Thou didst preserue me styll in hope, while I did sucke her brest. 10I was committed from my birth, with thee to haue abod: Since I was in my mothers wombe thou hast ben euer my God. The seconde parte. 11Then Lorde depart not now from me in thys my present gryef: Since I haue none to be my helpe, my succor and relyef. 12So many bulles doo compasse me, that be full strong of head: Yea bulles so fat as though they had, in Basan field be fed. 13They gape vpon me gredely. as though they would me slay: Muche like a Lion roring out, and ramping for his praye. 14But I drop downe lyke water shed, my ioyntes in sunder breake: My hart doeth in my body melt, lyke waxe against the heate. 15And like a potshard drithe my strength my tonge it cleaueth fast: Unto my iawes, and I am brought, to dust of death at last. 16And many dogges doo compas me, and wicked counsell eke: Conspire against me cursedlie, they pearse my handes and fete. 17I was tormented so that I, might all my bones haue tolde: Yet styll vpon me they doo loke, and still they me beholde: 18My garments they deuided eke, in partes amonge them all: And for my coate they did cast lottes, to whom it might be fall. 19Therfore I pray thee be not farre, fro me at my great nead: But rather sith thou arte my strength, to helpe me (Lorde) make speade. 20And fr? the sword (Lord) saue my soule by thy might and thy powre: And kepe my soule thy darlyng deare, from dogges that would deuoure. 21And from the Lions mouth that would me all in sunder shiuer: And from the hornes of Unicornes, Lorde safely me delyuer. 22And I shall to my brethren all, thy maiestie recorde: And in thy church shall praise the name of thee the liuyng Lorde. The thirde parte. 23All ye that feare hym prayse the Lorde: Thou sede of Iacob honor hym: And with al reuerence possible: thou sede of Israell worship him. 24For he despiseth not the poore, he tourneth not awrye: His countenaunce when they doo call, but graunteth to theyr crye. 25Among thy flocke that feare the Lorde, I will therfore proclayme: Thy prayse and kepe my promise made, for settyng forth thy name. 26The poore shall eate and be suffised, and those that doo theyr deuer: To knowe the Lorde shall prayse hys name, theyr hartes shall lyue foreuer. 27All costes of earth shall prayse the Lorde, and tourne to hym for grace: The Heathen folke shall worship hym, before his blessed face. 28The kingdome of the Heathen folke, the Lorde shall haue therfore: And he shalbe their gouernor, and kyng for euermore. 29The ryche men of his godly gyftes, shall feede, and tast also: And in hys presence worship hym, and bow their knees full low. 30And all that shall go downe to dust, of lyfe by him must tast My seed shall serue and praise his name whyle any world shall last. 31My seed shall plainly shew to them, that shalbe borne hereafter: His iustice and his rightuousnes, and all his workes of wonder. Dominus regit me. Psalm. xxiii. T.S. Because the prophet had proued the great mercies of God at diuers times, and in sundry manners: he gathereth a certayne assuraunce, fully perswadyng hym selfe that God wil continue the very same goodnes towardes him for euer. Sing this as the .xxi. psalme. [1] My shepehard is the liuing Lorde, Nothing therfore I nead: In pastors fayre, with waters calme he set me for to fead. 2He did conuert and glad my soule, and brought my minde in frame: To walke in pathes of rightuousnes, for his most holy name. 3Yea though I walke in vale of death, yet will I feare non ill: Thy rod, thy staffe, doeth comfort me, and thou art with my styll. 4And in the presence of my foes, my table thou shalt spread: Thou shalt (O Lord) fill full my cup, and eke annoynt my head. 5Through all my lyfe thy fauour is, So frankly shewde to me: That in thy house for euermore, my dwelling place shalbe. Domini est terra. Psalme. xxiiii. I.H. Because the grace of God was then to be vttered in the temple, more glorious then before it had ben in the tabernacle, Dauid geueth it a more glorious title, and with exclamation setteth forth the honor ther of, styring vs to the consideration of the eternall mansions prepared for vs in the heauens: wherof this was a shadow and figure. Sing this as the .xxi. psal [1] The earth is all the Lordes, with all, her store and furniture: Yea hys is all the worlde, and all, that therin doo indure. 2For he hathe fastly founded it. aboue the sea to stand: And layd alow the liquid flouds, to flow beneathe the land. 3For who is he (O Lorde) that shall, ascend into thy hyll Or passe into thy holy place, there to continew styll. 4Whose h?ds are harmles, &amp; whose hart no spot there doth defyle: His soule not set on vanitie, who hathe not sworne no guyle. 5Him that is such a one the Lorde, shall place in blisfull plight: And God his God, and sauior, shall yelde to hym his right. 6This is the broode of trauelers, in sekyng of hys grace: As Iacob did the Israelite, in that time of his race. 7Ye princes open your gates stand open, the euerlastyng gate: For there shall entre in thereby, the king of gloryous state. 8What is the kynge of glorious. the strong and mighty Lord: The mightye Lorde in battailes stoute, and tryall of the sword. 9Ye princes open your gates stand open, the euerlastyng gate: For there shall entre in therby, the king of Glorious state. 10What is this kinge of glorious, the Lorde of hostes it is: The kingdome and the royaltie, of glorious state is hys. Ad te domine leuaui. Psalm. xxv. T.S. The Prophet touched with the consideration of his sinnes, and also greued with the cruell malice of his enemies, prayeth to god most feruently to haue his sinnes forgeuen, especially suche as he had committed in his youth. He beginneth euery verse according to the Ebrue letters two or three except. [The first parte.] [1] I lift mine hart to the my god &amp; guide most iust. Now suffer me to take no shame, for in thee do I trust. [2]Let not my foes reioyce, nor make a scorne of me, And let them not be ouerthrow? that put their trust in thee. But shame shall them befall, whyche harme them wrongfully: 3Therfore thy pathes &amp; thy rightwaies, vnto me Lorde descry. 4Direct me in thy trueth, and teache me I thee pray: Thou art my God and sauiour, on thee I wayte alway. 5Thy mercyes manifolde, I pray thee Lorde remember: And eke thy pitye plentifull, for they haue ben for euer. 6Remember not the fautes, and frailtie of my youth: Remembre not how ignorant, I haue ben of thy trouth: Nor after my desertes, let me thy mercy fynde: But of thyne owne beningnitie, Lorde haue me in thy mynde. 7His mercy is full swete, hys truthe a perfect guyde: Therfore the Lorde wyll sinners teach and suche as go asyde. 8The humble he will teache, hys precepts to kepe: He wyll direct in all hys wayes, the lowly and the meke, 9For all the wayes of God, are trueth and mercy bothe: To them that kepe hys testament, the witnes of his trouth. The seconde parte. 10Now for thy holy name, O Lorde I thee intreat: To graunt me pardon for my sinne, for it is wondrous great, True felicitye standeth in the feare of God. 11Who so doeth feare the Lorde, the Lorde doeth him direct: To leade his lyfe in suche awaye, as he doeth best accept. 12His soule shall euermore, in goodnes dwell and stande: His seede and his posteritie, inherite shall the lande, 13All those that feare the Lorde, know hys secret intent: And vnto them he doth declare, hys wyll and testament. 14Mine eyes and eke my hart, to hym I wyll aduaunce: That pluckt my fete our of the snare, of sinne and ignoraunce. 15With mercy me beholde, to thee I make my mone: For I am poore and desolate, and comfortles alone. 16The troubles of mine hart, are multiplyed in dede: Bring me out of this misery, necessitiy and nede. 17Beholde my pouertie, mine anguish and my payne: Remit my sinne and myne offence, and make me cleane agayne: 18O Lorde beholde my foes, how they doo styll increase: Pursuing me with deadly hate, that fayne would lyue in peace. 19Preserue and kepe my soule, and eke deliuer me: And let me not be ouerthrowne, because I trust in thee. 20Let my simple purenes, me from mine enemies shend: Because I loke, as one of thyne, that thou shouldest me defend. 21Deliuer Lorde thy folke, and send them some relief: I meane thy chosen Israell, from all theyr payne and grief. Iudica me domine. Psalme. xxvi. I.H. Dauid oppressed with many iniuryes, finding no helpe in the worlde, called for ayde from God: and assured of his integritie toward Saul, desireth God to be his iudge and to defend his innocency, causeles afflicted. Finally he maketh mention of his sacrifice whiche he will offer for his deliueraunce, and desireth to be in the company of the faithfull in the congregation of God, whence he was banished by Saule, promisyng integritie of life &amp; open praises and thankes geuing. Sing this as the .xviii. psalme. [1] Lorde be my iudge, and thou shall see, My pathes be right and plaine: I trust in God, and hope that he, will strength me to remaine. 2Proue me my God I thee desire, my waies to searche and trie: As men do proue theyr gold with fire, my reines and hert espie. 3Thy goodnes laide before my face, I durst be bold alwaies: For of thy trueth I tread the trace, and will doo all my dayes. 4I doo not lust to haunt or vse, with men whose dedes ar vayne: To come in house I doo refuse, with the deceiptfull trayne. 5I muche abhorre the wicked sort, their dedes I doo despise: I doo not once to them resort, that hurtfull thinges deuyse, 6My handes I washe and doo procede, in workes that walke vpryght: Then to the aulter I make spede, to offer there in sight. 7That I may speak &amp; preache the prayse that doth belonge to thee: And so declare how wondrous wayes thou hast ben good to me. 8O Lorde thy house I loue most deare, to me it doeth excell: I haue delight and would be neare, wher as thy grace doeth dwell. 9Oh shut not vp my soule with them, in sinne that take their fill, Nor yet my lyfe amongst those men, that seke much bloud to spill. 10Whose hands ar heapt with craft &amp; guile their life therof is full: And their right hand with wr?ch &amp; wile, for bribes doth pluck and pull. 11But I in rightuousnes entend, my time and daies to serue Haue mercy Lorde and me defende, so that I doo not swarue. 12My fote is stayed for all assayes, it standeth well and right: Wherfore to God will I geue prayse, in all the peoples sight. Dominus illuminatio. Psal. xxvii. I.H. Dauid maketh this Psalme, being deliuered fr? great pearils as appeareth by the prayses and thankesgeuyng annexed wherin we may see the constant fayth of Dauid against the assaults of all enemies, and also thende wherfore he desireth to lyue and to be deliuered, only to worship God in his congregation. Herby he promiseth hymself assuraunce, though father &amp; mother forsake hym, he teacheth this to be the only way, to to see the good thinges in the land of the liuing, and after his example he exhorteth to faith and to attend vpon the Lorde. Sing this as the .xviii. psalme. [1] The Lord is bothe my health and light shall man make me dismayde? Sith God doth geue me strength &amp; might why should I be afrayde? 2While that my foes with all their str?gth begin with me to brawle: And thinke to eate me vp at length, themselues haue caught the fall. 3Thoughe they in campe against me lye, my hart is not afrayd: In battell pight if they will trye, I trust in God for ayde. 4One thing of God I doo require, that he will not denye: For whiche I pray and will desyre, till he to me applye. 5That I within his holy place, my lyfe throughout may dwell: To see the beauty of his face, and vew his temple well. 6In time of dreade he shall me hide, within hys place most pure: And kepe me secret by hys syde, as on a rocke most sure. 7At length I know the Lordes good grace, shall make me strong and stoute: My foes to foile and cleane deface, that compasse me about. 8Therfore within his house will I. Geue sacrifice of prayse: With Psalmes and songes I will applye, to laude the Lorde alwayes. 9Lorde heare the voyce of my request, for whyche to thee I call: Haue mercy (Lord) on me opprest, and send me helpe withall. 10My hart doth knowledge vnto thee, I sue to haue thy grace: Then seke my face sayste thou to me, Lorde I will seke thy face. 11In wrath turne not thy selfe away, Nor suffer me to slide: Thou art my helpe still to this day, be still my God and guide. 12My parentes both theyr sonne forsoke, and cast me of at large: And then the Lorde himselfe yet toke, of me the cure and charge. 13Teache me, O God, the way to thee, and leade me on forth ryght: For feare of suche as watche for me, to trap me if they might. 14Do not betake me to the will, of them that be my foes: For they surmyse against me styll, false witnes to depose, 15My hart would faint but that in me, this hope he fixed fast: The Lorde Gods good grace shall it see, in lyfe that aye shall laste. 16Trust still in God, whose whole thou art, His will abide thou must: And he shall ease and strength thy hart, if thou in hym doo trust. Ad te domine clamabo. Psal. xxviii. I.H. Being in great feare and pensiuenes to see God dishonoured by the wicked men, he desireth to be rid of them, and cryeth for vengeaunce against them, and at length assureth hym selfe, that God hath hard his prayer, vnto whose tuition he commendeth all the faithefull. Sing this as the .xxi. psal [1] Thou art (O Lord) my strength and stay, the succor whyche I craue: Neglect me not, lest I be lyke, to them that go to graue. 2The voyce of thy suppliant heare, that vnto thee doeth crye: When I lift vp, my handes vnto, thy holy arke moste hye. 3Repute not me among the sort, of wicked and peruert: That speake ryght fayre vnto theyr fr?ds, and thinke full ill in hart. 4According to theyr handy worke, as they deserue in dede: And after their inuencions, let them receyue theyr mede. 5For they regarde nothing Godes workes, his lawe ne yet his lore: Therfore will he them and theyr seede, destroy for euermore. 6To render thankes vnto the Lorde, how great a cause haue I: My voyce, my prayer and my complaynt, that heard so willingly. 7He is my shield and fortitude, my buckeler in destresse. My hope, my helpe, my hartes relyef, my songe shall him confesse. 8He is our strength and oure defence, our enmies to resist: The health and the saluacion, of his electe by Chryste. 9Thy people and thine heritage, Lorde blesse, guide, and preserue: Increase them Lorde, and rule theyr harts that they may neuer swerue. Afferte domino. Psalme. xxix. T.S. An excellent Psalme, wherin the Prophet exhorteth the verye Princes and rulers of the world (whiche otherwise for the most parte thinke there is no God) at the leaste to feare hym for the thunders and tempestes, for feare wherat all creatures tremble. And though thereby God threatneth sinners, yet is he alwayes mercyfull to hys, and moueth them therby to prayse his name. Sing this as the .xxi. Psa. [1] Giue to the Lorde, ye potentates, ye rulers of the worlde: Geue ye all prayse, honor and strength, vnto the liuing Lorde. 2Geue honor to his holy name, and honor him alone: Worship hym in his maiestie, within his holy throne. 3His voyce doth rule the waters all, euen as him selfe doth please: He doth prepare the thunder clappes, and gouerneth all the sease. He meaneth the thunderinges, &amp; tempestes. 4The voyce of God, is of great force, and wonderous excellent: It is most mightye in effect, and muche magnificent. 5The voyce of God, doeth rent and break the Cedre trees so long: The Cedre tres of Libanus, whiche are most hie and strong. 6And makth them leape, like as a calf, or els the Unicorne: Not only trees, but mountaines great, wheron the tres are borne. 7His voice deuideth flames of fyre, and shakth the wildernes: 8It makth the desert quake for feare, that called is Cades. 9It makth the Hindes, for feare to calue and makth the couerte playne: Then in his temple euery man, his glory doth proclaime. 10The Lorde was set aboue the floudes, ruling the raging sea: So shall he raygne, as Lord and king for euer and for aye. 11The Lorde will geue his people power, in vertue to increase: The Lord wyll blesse hys chosen folke. with euerlastyng peace. Exaltabo te domine. Psal. xxx. I. Hop. When Dauid should haue dedicated hys house to the Lorde, he fel so extreme sick, that he was without all hope of lyfe, &amp; therfore after hys recouery, he rendreth thankes to God, exhortyng others to the lyke, &amp; learn by his example, that God is rather mercyfull then seuere, and rigorous towardes his childr?, and also that the fall from prosperitie is sodeine. This done, he retourneth to prayer, promisyng to prayse God for euer. [1] All laud &amp; praise, with hart &amp; voice, O Lorde I geue to thee: whiche didst not make my foes reioyse, but hast exalted me. [2]O lord my god to thee I cryde, in all my paine &amp; grief: thou gauest an eare, and didst prouide to ease me with relief, 3Of thy good will thou hast calde backe, My soule from hell to saue: Thou didst reuiue when strength did lacke, and kept me from the graue. 4Sing prayse ye sainctes that proue and see, the goodnes of the Lord: In memorye of his maiestie, Reioyse with one accord. 5For why his anger but a space, doeth last and slake agayne: But in his fauour and hys grace, alwayes doeth lyfe remayne. Though gripes of grief, and panges full sore, shall lodge with vs all night: The Lorde to ioy shall vs restore, before the day be light. 6When I enioyde the worlde at will, thus would I boast and say: Tushe, I am sure to feele none ill, this wealth shall not decay. 7For thou (O Lorde of thy good grace, hadst sent me strength and ayde. But when thou turnd away thy face, my mynde was sore dismaide. 8Wherfore agayne yet did I cry, to thee, O Lorde of might: My God with plaintes I did apply, and prayde both day and night. 9What gayne is in my bloud saide I, if death destroy my dayes: Doth dust declare thy maiestie, or yet thy trueth doth prayse? 10Wherfore my God some pitie take, O Lorde I thee desyre: Do not this simple soule forsake, of helpe I thee requyre. 11Then didst thou turne my grief and wo, vnto a chearfull voyce: The mournyng weede thou tokste me fro, and madst me to reioyse. 12Wherfore my soule vncessauntly, shall syng vnto thy prayse: My Lorde, my God, to thee will I, Geue laude and thankes alwayes. Inte domine speraui. Psal. xxxi. Io. Hop. Dauid deliuered from some great daunger, in the desert of Madis or els wher, first reherseth what meditation he had by the power of fayth when death was before his eyes, his enemy beyng ready to take him: then he adioyneth the fauor of God alwaies to be ready to those that feare him. Finally he exhorteth al the faithful to trust in God &amp; to loue him, because he preserueth and strengthneth, them, as they may se by his example. Sing this as the .xviii. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] O Lorde I put my trust in thee, Let nothyng worke me shame: As thou art iust deliuer me, and set me quyte from blame. 2Geue me (O Lorde) and that anone. to helpe me make good spead, Be thou my rocke, and house of stone, my fence in time of nede. 3For why as stones thy strength is tride thou art my fort and towre: For thy names sake be thou my guyde, and leade me in thy power. 4Plucke forth my feete, &amp; break the snare which they for me haue layde: Thou art my strength, and all my care is for thy might and ayde. 5In to thy handes Lorde I commit, my spirite whyche is thy dew: For why thou hast redemed it, O Lorde thou God most trewe. 6I hate suche folke as wyll not part, from thynges to be abhorde: When they on trifles set theyr harte, my truste is in the Lorde. 7For I will in thy mercy ioy, I see it doeth excell: Thou seest when ought would me annoy, and knowest my soule full well. 8Thou hast not left me in their hande, that would me ouercharge. But thou hast set me out of bande, to walke abrode at large. The seconde parte. 9Great grief (O Lord) doeth me assaile some pitye on me take: Mine eyes waxe dimme, my might doth faile my wombe for wo doth ake. 10My lyfe is worne with grief and paine my yeares in wo are past: My strength is gone &amp; through disdaine my bones corrupt and wast. 11Amonge my foes I am a scorne, my frendes are all dismaide: My neighbours and my kinsmen borne to see me are afrayde. 12As men once dead are out of minde, so am I now forgot: As small effect in me they finde, as in a broken pot. 13I heard the bragges of all the route, theyr threates my minde did fraye: How they conspirde and went about, to take my lyfe awaye. 14But (Lorde) I trust in thee for ayde, not to be ouer trod: For I confesse and still haue saide, thou art my Lorde and God. 15The length of all my lyfe and age, O Lorde, is in thy hand: Defend me from the wrathes and rage, of them that me withstand. 16To me thy seruaunt (Lord) expresse, and shew thy ioifull face: And saue me Lorde for thy goodnes, thy mercy and thy grace. The thirde parte. 17Lorde let me not be put to blame, for that on thee I call: But let the wicked beare their shame, and in the graue to fall. 18Oh how great good hast thou in store, layde vp full safe for them: That feare and trust in thee therfore, before the sonnes of men. 19Thy presence shall th? fence and guide, from al proud bragges and wrongs Within thy place thou shalt them hyde from all the stryfe of tonges. 20Thankes to the lord that hath declard on me his grace so farre: Me to defend with watche and ward, as in a towne of warre. 21Thus did I say both day and night, when I was sore opprest: Loe, I was cleane cast out of sight, yet heardst thou my request, 22Ye sainctes, loue ye the Lord, I say, the faithfull he doth guide: And to the proude he will repay, according to their pride. 23Be strong and God shall stay your hart be bolde and haue a lust: For sure the Lorde wyll take your part, sith ye on him doo trust. Beati quorum remissi sunt. Psal. xxxii. T.S. Dauid punished with greuous sicknes for his sinnes, counteth them happy to whom God doeth not impute theyr transgressions. And after that he had confessed his sinnes and obteyned pardon, he exhorteth the wicked men to lyue godly, and the good to reioyse. Sing this as the .xxx. psal [1] The man is blest, whose wickednes. the Lorde hath cleane remitted: And he whose sin and wretchednes, is hid and also couered. 2And blest is he to whom the Lorde, imputeth not hys sinne: Whyche in hys hart hath hid no guile, nor fraude is founde therin. 3For whilst that I kept close my sinne, in silence and constraynt: My bones did weare and wast away, with dayly mone and playnt. 4For night and day thy hand on me so greuous was and smert: That all my bloud and humours moist, to driues did conuert. 5I did therfore confes my fault, and all my sinnes discouer: Then thou (O Lord) diddest me forgeue, and all my sinnes passe ouer. 6The humble man shall pray therfore, and seke thee in due time: So that the floudes of waters great, shall haue no power on hym. 7When trouble and aduersitie, doo compasse me about: Thou art my refuge and my ioye, and thou doest rid me out. 8Come hither and I shall thee teache, howe thou shalt walke a right: And will thee guide as I my self, haue learnd by profe and sight. 9Be not so rude and ignoraunt, as is the horse and mule: Whose mouth without a raine or bit, from harme thou canst not rule: 10The wicked man shall manifolde, sorowes and grief sustayne: But vnto him that trusteth in God, his goodnes shall remayne. 11Be mery therfore in the Lorde, ye iust lyft vp your voyce: And ye of pure and perfect hart, be glad and eke reioyce. Exultate iusti in domino. Psalm. xxxiii. I.H. He exhorteth good men to prayse God, for that he hath not only created all thynges and by his prouidence gouerneth the same: but also is faythful in his promises. He vnderstandeth mans hart, and scattereth the counsell of the wicked. So that no man can be preserued by any creature or mans strength: but they that put their confidence in hys mercy, shalbe preserued from all aduersitie. Sing this as the .xxx. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] Ye rightuous in the Lorde reioyse, it is a semely sight: That vpright men with thankfull voyce, should prayse the God of might. 2Prayse ye the Lorde with harp and songe, in Psalmes and pleasant thinges: With lute and instrument among, that soundeth with ten stringes. 3Sing to the Lord a song most new, with courage geue him prayes: 4For why? his word is euer true, his workes and all his wayes, 5To iudgement equitie and right, he hath a great good will: And with his gifts he doth delight, the earth through out to fill. 6For by the worde of God alone, the heauens all were wrought: Theyr hostes and powers euery chone his breath to passe hathe brought. 7The waters great gathered hath he, on heapes within the shore: And hid them in the depth to be, as in an house of store. 8All men on earth both least and most, feare God and kepe hys lawe: Ye that inhabite in eche cost, dreade hym and stande in awe. 9What he c?maunded wrought it was, at once with present spede: What he doth will, is brought to passe. with full effect in dede. 10The counsels of the nacions rude, the Lorde doth driue to nought: No counsell c? preuaile against God, but shall haue ill succes. He doth defeate the multitude, of their deuise and thought. 11But his decres continue still, they neuer slake or swage: The motions of his mind and will, take place in euery age. The sec?d parte. 12And blest are they to whom the Lorde as God and guide is knowen: Whom he doth chose of mere accorde: to take them as his owne. 13The Lorde from heauen cast his sight, on men mortall by birth: 14Considering from his seate of might, the dwellers of the earth. 15The lord I say, whose h?d hath wrought mans hart, and doth it frame: For he alone doth know the thought, and working of the same. God only deliuereth and preserueth his people 16A king that trusteth in his host, shall nought preuayle at length. The man that of his might doth boast, shall fall for all his strength. 17The troupes of horsemen eke shall faile their sturdie stedes shall sterue: The strength of horse shall not preuaile the rider to preserue. 18But lo, the eyes of God intend, and watche to ayde the iust: With such as feare him to offende, and on his goodnes trust. 19That he of death and all distres, may set theyr soule from dread: And if that death the land oppresse, in honger them to fead. 20Wherfore our soule doeth still depende, on God our strength and stay: He is the shield vs to defende, and driue all dartes away. 21Oure soule in God, hath ioy and game. reioysing in his might: For why? in his most holy name, we hope and muche delight: 22Therfore let thy goodnes (O Lorde) still present with vs be: As we alwayes with one accorde, doo onely trust in thee. Benedicam domino. Psal. xxxiiii. T. Stern. After Dauid had escaped Achis, according as is writt? in the 1. Sa. xxi. whome in this title he calleth Abimelech (whiche was a general name to al the kings of the Philistenes) he prayseth God for his deliueraunce prouoking all others, by his example to trust in God, to feare and serue him, who defendeth the godly with his angels, and vtterly destroieth the wicked in theyr sinnes. Sing this as the .xxx. psal. [The first parte.] [1] I will geue laud and honor both, Unto the Lorde alwayes: And eke my mouth for euermore, shall speake vnto his prayes. 2I doo delite to laude the Lorde, in soule and eke in voyce: That humble men and mortified, may heare and so reioyce. 3Therfore see that ye magnifye, with me the liuyng Lorde: And let vs now exalt hys name, together with one accorde. 4For I my selfe besought the Lorde, he answered me agayne: And me deliuered incontinent, from all my feare and paine. 5Who so they be that him beholde, shall see his light most cleare: Their countenaunce shall not be dashed they nede it not to feare. 6This sely wretch for some relyef, vnto the Lorde did call: Gen, 19. 31. 32. 4. Reg. 6. Heb. 1Who did him heare without delay, and rid him out of thrall. 7The angell of the Lorde doth pitche, his tentes in euery place: To saue all suche as feare the Lorde, that nothing them deface, 8Tast and consider well therfore, that God is good and iust O happy man that maketh hym, his onely stay and trust. 9Feare ye the Lorde his holy ones, aboue all earthly thing: For they that feare the liuing Lorde, are sure to lack nothyng. 10The Lions shall be hongerbit, and pinde with famine muche: But as for them that feare the Lorde, no lacke shalbe to suche. The seconde parte. 11Come neare therfore my children deare and to my wordes geue eare: I shall you teache the perfite way, how you the Lorde should feare. 12Who is that man that would liue long, 1. Pete. 5.b. and leade a blessed lyfe? 13Se thou refrayne thy tong and lippes, from all disceipt and stryfe. 14Turne backe thy face from doing ill, Heb. iiii.c. Eccle. xv.d. and doo the godly dede: Inquire for peace and quyetnes, and folow it with spede. 15For why the eyes of God aboue, vpon the iust are bent: His eares like wise do heare the plaint of the pore innocent. 16But he doth frowne &amp; bend his browes vpon the wicked trayne: And cutt away the memory, that should of them remayne. 17But when the iust doo call and cry, the Lorde doo heare them so: That out of paine and misery, forthewith he letth them go. 18The Lord is kind and straight at hand to suche as be contrite: He sauthe also the sorowfull, the meke and poore in spirite. 19Full many be the miseries, that righteous men doo suffer: But out of all aduersities, the Lorde doth them deliuer, 20The Lorde doeth so preserue and kepe, his very bones alway: That not so muche as one of them, doth pearish or decay, 21The sinne shall slea the wicked man, whiche he him self hathe wrought: And suche as hate the righteous man. shall soone be brought to nought. 22But they that serue the liuyng Lorde, the Lorde doth saue them sounde: And who that put their trust in hym, nothing shall them confounde. Iudica domine, Psalm. xxxv. I. Hop. So long as Saull was enemie to Dauid, all that had ani auctoritie vnder him, to flater their king did also most Cruellie persecute Dauid: against whome he prayeth God to plead &amp; to aueng his cause, that thei maie be taken in their netts &amp; snares, wich they laid for him, &amp; his inocencie maie be declared. And that the inocent which taketh part with him maie reioice &amp; praise the name of the lord that thus deliuereth his seruaunt. And so he promyseth to speake furth the iustice of the lord &amp; to magnifie his name all the dayes of his lyfe. [The first parte.] [1] [1] Lorde pleade my cause against my foes, confounde their force and myght: Fyght on my part, against all those, that seke with me to fight. [2]Lay hand vpon thy speare &amp; shild, thy selfe in armour dres: st?d vp for me &amp; fight the feld, to help me from distres. 3Gird on thy sworde, and stoppe the waye, my enemies to withstande: That thow vnto, my soule doo saye, lo I thy helpe at hande. 4Confounde them with rebuke and blame, that seke my soule to spill: Let them turne backe and flie with shame, that thinke to worke me ill. 5Let them disperse, and flie abrode, as winde doth driue the duste: And that the aungell of our God, their might away may thrust. 6Let all theyr wayes, be voide of light, and slipprie lyke to fall: And send thine aungell with thy might to persecute them all. 7For why without my faulte they haue, in secret set their grinne: And for no cause haue digd a caue: to take my soule therin. 8When they think least and haue no care O Lorde destroy them all. Let them be trapt in their owne snare, and in theyr mischief fall. 9And let my soule my harte and voyce, in God haue ioye and welthe: That in the Lorde I may reioyce, and in his sauing health. 10And then my bones shall speake &amp; saye my partes shall all agree: O lorde though they doo seme full gaie, what man is lyke to thee. The seconde parte. 11Thou doest defend the weake from th? that are bothe stout and stronge: And ridde the poore from wicked men that spoyle and doo them wronge. 12My cruell foes against me ryse, to witnes thinges vntrue: And to acuse me they deuise, of that I neuer knew. 13Where I to them did owe good will, they quite me with disdayne: That they should pay my good with ill my soule doth sore complayne. 14When they wer sicke I mornd therfore and clad my selfe in sack. With fasting I did faint full sore, to pray I was not slacke. 15As they had ben my brethern dere, I did my selfe behaue: As one that maketh wofull chere, about his mothers graue, But they at my dissease did ioye, and gather on a route: Yea abiect slaues at me did toye, with mockes and checks full stoute. 17The belly gods and flattering trayne, that all good thinges deride: At me doe grin with great disdayne, and plucke their mouth a syde. 18Lord when wilt thou amend this geare why doest thou stay and pause: Oh rid my soule myne only deare, out of these Lyons clawes. 19And then will I geue thankes to thee, before thy churche alwayse: And where as most of people be, there will I shew thy prayse. 20Let not my foes preuayle on me, whiche hate me for no faulte: Nor yet to winke or tourne theyr eye, that causeles me assaulte. The third parte. 21Of peace no worde they think or say, theyr taulke is all vntrue: They still consult and would betraye, all those that peace ensue. 22With open mouth they run at me, they gape, thei laugh, thei flere: Well wel, say they our eye doth see, the thyng that we desire. 23But Lorde thou seest what waies they take sease not this geare to mende: Be not far of nor me forsake, as men that fayle their frend. 24Awake, aryse, and stirre abrode, defend me in my right: Reuenge my cause my Lorde my God, and ayde me with thy might. 25Accordyng to thy righteousnes, my Lorde God set me free: And let not them their pride expresse, nor triumphe ouer me. 26Let not their hartes reioyce and cry, there, there, this geare doth trime: Nor geue them cause to say on hye, we haue our will of hym. 27Confound them with rebuke &amp; shame, that ioy, when I do mourne: And pay them home with spite &amp; blame that brag at me with scorne. 28Let them be glad and eke reioyce, which loue mine vpright waye: And they all times with harte &amp; voyce, shall prayse the Lorde and saye. 29Greate is the Lorde and doth excell, for why he doth delyght: To see his seruaunts prosper well, that is his pleasaunt sight. 30Wherfore my tonge I will applye, thy righteousnes to prayse: Unto the Lorde, my God will I, sing laudes with thankes alwayse, Dixit iniustus. Psalme. xxxvi. I.H. Dauid greuously vexed by the wicked, doth complayne of their malyce &amp; wickednes. Th? he turneth to consider the vnspeakable goodnes of God towardes all creatures: But specially towards hys children, that by faithe therof he maie be comforted and assured of his deliueraunce by this ordenary course of Gods worke, who in the ende destroyeth the wicked and saueth the iuste. Sing this as the .xxxv. psalme. [1] The wicked with his workes vniust, doth thus perswade my hart: That of the Lorde he hathe no trust, his feare is set aparte. 2Yet doth he ioye in his estate, to walke as he began: So long till he deserue the hate, of God and eke of man: 3His wordes ar wicked, vile and naught, his tong no truth doth tell: Yet at no hand will he be taught, which way he may doo well. 4When he should slepe then doth he muse, his mischife to fulfill: No wicked wayes doth he refuse, nor nothing that is ill. 5But Lorde thy goodnes doth ascend, aboue the heauens high: So doth thy truth it selfe extend, vnto the cloudie skie. 6Much more then hilles, so high &amp; steepe thy iustice is exprest: Thy iudgments like to sease most deepe thou sauest both man and beaste. 7Thy mercy is, aboue all thinges, O God it doth excell: In trust wherof as in thy winges, the sonnes of men shall dwell. 8Within thy house they shalbe fedde, with plenty at theyr will: Of all delight they shalbe sped, and take therof their fill. 9For why the well of life so pure, doth ouer flow from thee: And in thy light, we are full sure, the lasting light alwayse to see. 10From such as thee desire and knowe, let not thy grace departe: Thy righteousnes declare and shew, to men of vpright hart. 11Let not the proude on me preuayle, O Lorde of thy good grace? Nor let the wicked me assayle, to throwe me out of place. 12But they in their deuice shall fall, that wicked workes maintaine: They shalbe ouerthrowne with all, and neuer rise agayne. Noli emulari. Psalme. xxxvii. W.W. Because the godly shoulde not wonder to see wicked men prosper in this world: the prophet sheweth that all thinges shal be graunted according to theyr harts desire, to them that loue and feare God: &amp; they that do the contrary, although they seme to florish for a time, shall at lengthe peryshe. Sing this as the .xxxv. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] Grudge not to see the wicked men, in wealth to florish styll: Nor yet enuie suche as to ill, haue bent and set their will. 2For as grene gras &amp; florishing herbes, are cut and wither awaye: So shall theyr great prosperitie, sone passe, fade, and decay. 3Trust thou therfore in God alone, to do well geue thy minde: So shalt thou haue the land as thyne, and there sure foode shalt find. 4In God set all thy harts delyte, and loke what thou wouldst haue: Or els canst wish in all the worlde, thou nedest it not to craue. 5Cast both thy selfe and thyne affayres, on God with perfect trust: And thou shalt see with patience, theffect both sure and iust. 6The perfect life and godly name, he will cleare as the light: So that the sunne, euen at none daies, shall not shine halfe so bryght. 7Be still therfore, and stedfastly, on God see thou wayte then: Nor shrinking for the prosperous state, of leude and wicked men. 8Shake of despite, enuy and hate, at least in any wise: Their wicked steppes, auoyd and flie, and folow not their guise. 9For euery wicked man, will God, destroy both more and lesse But suche as trust in him are sure, the lande for to posses. 10Watch but a whyle, and thou shalt see, no more the wicked trayne: No not so muche, as house or place, where once he did remayne. The seconde parte. 11But mercifull and humble men, enioy shall sea and land: In rest and peace they shall reioyse, for nought shall them withstand. 12The leud men and malicious, against the iust conspire: They gnash their teeth at him, as men, whiche doo his bane desire. 13But while that leud men thus do think the Lorde laugh them to scorne: For why he seeth their terme approche, When they shall sygh and morne. 14The wicked haue their sword out draw? their bowe eke haue they bent: To ouerthrow and kill the poore, as they the right way went. 15But the same sword shal pearse their harts which was to kil the iust: Likewise the bow shal breake to shiuers wherin they put theyr trust. 16Doubtles the iust mans poore estate, is better a great deale more: Then all these leud and worldly mens, rich pompe and heaped store. 17For be their power neuer so stronge, God will it ouerthrowe: Where contrary he doth preserue, the humble men and lowe. 18He seeth by his great prouidence, the good mens trade and way: And will geue them inheritaunce, which neuer shall decay. 19They shall not be discouraged, when some are hard bested: When other shalbe hungre bit, they shall be clad and fed. 20For whosoeuer wicked is, and enemie to the Lorde: Shal quaile, yea melt eu? as l?bs grease or smoke that flieth abrode, The thirde parte. 21Beholde the wicked boroweth muche, and neuer paith againe: Wheras the iust by liberall giftes, makth many glad and faine. 22For they wh? God doth bles, shall haue the laude for heritage: And they whom he doth curse likewise, shall pearysh in his rage. 23The Lord the iust m?s waies doth guid and geuth him good successe: To euery thing he taketh in hande, he sendeth good addresse. 24Though that he fall, yet is he sure, not vtterly to quayle: Because the Lord stretche out his hand, at nede, and doth not fayle. 25I haue ben yong and now am olde, yet did I neuer see: The iust man left, or els his sede, to begge for miserye. 26But geueth alwayes most liberally, and lend the wheras is nede: His children and posteritie, receiue of God their mede. 27Flee vice therfore and wickednes, and vertue doo embrace: So God shall graunt thee long to haue in earth a dwellyng place: 28For God so loueth equitie, and shewth to his such grace: That he preserueth them euermore, but destroyth the wicked race. 29Where as the good and godly men, inherite shall the land: Hauing as Lordes all thing therin, in their owne power and hand. 30The iust mans mouth doth euer speake, of maters wise and hye: His tong doth talke to edifie, with truth and equitie. 31For in his hart the law of God, his Lorde doth still abide: So that where he goeth or walketh, his foote can neuer slide. 32The wicked like a rauening wolfe, the iust man doth beset: By all meanes seking him to kill, if he fall in his net. The forthe parte. 33Though he should fall into his hands, yet God would succor send: Though men against him sentence geue, God would him yet defend. 34Wayt thou on God, and kepe his way, he shall preserue thee then: The earth to rule and thou shalt see, destroyde these wicked men. 35The wicked haue I sene most strong, and placed in high degree: Florishing in all wealth and store, as doth the Laurell tree. 36But sodenly he passed away, and lo he was quite gone: Then I him sought, but could scarse finde the place where dwelt such one. 37Marke and behold the perfite man, how God doth him increase: For the iust man shall haue at length, great ioy with rest and peace. 38As for transgressours, wo to them, destroyde they shall all be: God will cut of theyr budding race, and ryche posteritie. 19But the saluation of the iust, doth come from God aboue: Who in their trouble sendth them aide of mercy grace and loue. 40God doth them helpe, saue and deliuer, from leud men and vniust: And still will saue them whilst that they in him do put theyr trust, Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 38. I.H. Dauid lying sicke of some greuous disease, acknowlegeth him selfe to be chastysed of the Lorde for his sinnes, and therfore prayeth God to tourne away his wrath, he vttereth the greatnes of his grief by many wordes and circumstances, as wounded with the arrowes of gods Ire, forsaken of his frends, euell entreated of his enemies, but in the ende with firme confidence he c?mendeth his cause to God, &amp; hopeth for spedie helpe at hys hande. Sing this as the .xxxv. psa. [The first parte.] Put me not to rebuke, O Lorde, in thy prouoked ire: Ne in thy heauy wrath, O Lorde, Correct me I desire. Thine arowes doo sticke fast in me, thy hand doth presse me sore: And in my flesh no health at all, appeareth any more. And all thys is by reason of, thy wrath that I am in: Nor any rest is in my bones. by reason of my synne. For, loe my wicked doinges, Lorde, aboue my hed are gone, As greater lode then I can beare, they lye me sore vpon. My woundes stinck and are festred so as lothesome is to see. Which all through mine owne folishnes betideth vnto me. And I in carefull wise am brought, in trouble and distres: That I go wayling all the day my dulfull heauines. My loynes are fild with sore disease, my flesh hath no whole parte: I feble am and broken sore, I rore for grefe of hart. Thou knowst, Lord, my desire: my grones are open in thy syght: My hart doth pant, my str?gth hath faild mine eyes haue lost theyr lyght. My louers and my wonted frendes. stand lokyng in my woe: And eke my kinesmen far away, are me departed froe. They that did seke my life, layd snares, and they that sought the way: To doo me hurt, spake lyes and thought, on treason all the day. The sec?d parte. But as a deefe man I became, that cannot heare at all: And as one dumme that opens not, his mouth to speake withall, For all my confidence, O Lorde, is wholly set in thee: O Lord, thou Lorde that art my God, thou shalt geue eare to me. This I did craue, that they, my foes, triumphe not ouer me: For when my foote did slip then they, did ioy my fall to see. And truly I poore wretch am set, in plage a wofull wight: And eke my grefefull heauines. is euer in my sight. For whyle that In my wickednes, in humble wise confesse, And while I for my sinfull dedes, my sorow doo expresse, My fooes doo still remayne alyue, and mighty are also: And they that hate me wrongfully, in number hugely growe. They stande agaynste me, that my God, with euell doo repay, Because that good and honest thynges, I doo ensue alway. Forsake me not, O Lolde, my God, be thou not far away: Hast, me to help, my Lord my God, my safety and my stay. Dixi custodiam [Psalm] xxxix. Iohn Hop. Dauid vttereth with what great gref and bitternes of mind he was driuen to these outragious complaynts of his infirmities, for he confesseth that when he had determined sylence, that he brast forth yet in to words that he woulde not, through the greatnes of his greef. Th? he reherseth certayne requests which tast of infirmitie of man, &amp; mixeth with them many prayers but all to shew a mind w?derfully troubled, that it may plainly appeare how he did stryue myghtlye agaynste deathe and desperatyon. Sing this as the .xxxv. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] I sayde I will loke to my wayes, For feare I should go wronge: I will take heede all tymes that I, Offend not in my tounge. 2As with a bit I will kepe fast, my mouth with force and might: Not once to whisper all the whyle, the wicked are in sighte. 3I held my tonge and spake no word, but kept me close and still, Yea from good tallke I did refrayne, but sore against my will. 4My hart waxt whote within my brest, with musing thought and doubte: Whiche did encrease, and stire the fire, at last these words brast oute. 5Lorde, number oute my lyfe and dayes whiche yet I haue not past: So that I may be certifyed, how long my lyfe shall laste, 6Lorde, thou hast poynted oute my lyfe, in length muche like a spanne: Mine age is nothing vnto thee, so vayne is euery man. 7Man walketh lyke a shade, and doth in vayne him self annoye, In getting goods, and cannot tell, who shall the same enioye. 8Now lord sith things this wise do frame what helpe doo I desire: Of truth my helpe doth hange on thee, I nothing elles require. The sec?d parte. 9From all the sinnes that I haue done, Lorde quyteme out of hand: And make me not a scorne to fooles, that nothing vnderstand. 10I was as dumme, and to complayne, no trouble might me moue: Because I know it was thy worke, my patience for to proue. 11Lord take from me thy scourg &amp; plage I can them not withstande: I faynt and pine away for feare, of thy most heuy hand. 12When thou for sinne dost man rebuke, he waxeth wo and wanne: As doth a clothe that mothes haue fret so vayne a thyng is man. 13Lord heare my sute and geue good hede regarde my teares that fall Soiourne like a straunger here as did my fathers all. 14Oh spare a litle geue me space, my strength for to restore: Before I go away from hence, and shall be seene no more. Expectans expectaui. Psalm. lx. I.H. Dauid deliuered from great daunger, doth magnifye and prayse the grace of God for his deliueraunce, and commendith his prouidence towardes all mankynd. Then doth he promyse to geue hym self wholy to Gods seruice, and so declareth how God is truly worshipped. Afterward he geueth thanckes and prayseth God, and hauing complained of his enemies w? good courage, he calleth for aide &amp; cuccour. Sing this as the .xxxv. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] I wayted longe and sought the Lorde, and patiently did beare: At length to me he did accorde, my voyce and cry to heare. 2He pluckt me from the lake so deepe, out of the mire and clay: And on a rocke he set my feete, and he did gide my waye. 3To me he taught a psalme of prayse, whiche I must shew abrode: And sing new songes of thankes alwayse, vnto the Lorde our God, 4When all the folke these thinges shall see, as people muche afrayde. Then they vnto the Lorde will flee, and trust vpon his ayde. 5O blest is he whose hope and hart, doth in the Lorde remayne: That with the proude doth take no part, nor suche as lye and faine, 6For Lorde my God thy wondrous dedes, in greatnes far doo passe: Thy fauour towards vs excedes, all things that euer was. 7When I entend and doo deuise, thy workes abrode to shew: To suche a reckning they doo ryse, therof no ende I know. 8Burnt offringes thou delightste not in, I know thy whole desire: With sacrifice to purge their sinne, thou doest no man require. 9Meate offering and sacrifice, thou woldst not haue at all: But thou O Lorde hast open made, mine eares to heare withall. 10But then said I behold and loke, I come a meane to be: For in the volume of the booke, thus it is sayd of me. The second parte. 11That I, O God, should doo thy minde, whiche thyng doth like me well: For in my hart thy lawe I fynde, fast placed there to dwell. 12Thy Iustice and thy righteousnes, in great resorts I tell: Beholde, my toung no time doth cease, O Lord thou knowest full well. 13I haue not hid within my brest, thy goodnes as by stelth, But I declare and haue exprest, thy truth and sauing health. 14I kept not close thy louyng minde, that no man shoulde it knowe: The trust that in thy truth I finde, to all the churche I shewe. 14For I with mischefes many one, am sore beset aboute: My sinnes encrease and so com on, I can not spy them out. 15For why in number they excede, the heares vpon my head: My hart doth faynt for very drede, that I almost am deade. 16With speed send help and set me free, O Lorde I thee require: Make hast with ayde to succour me, O Lorde at my desire. 17Let them sustayne rebuke and shame, that seeke my soule to spille: Driue back my foes and them defame, that wish and would me ill. 18For their ill feates doo them discrie, that wolde deface my name: Alwayse at me they rayle and cry, fie on him, fie for shame. 19Let them in thee haue ioye and welth that seeke to thee alwayse: That those that loue thy sauing health may say, to God be prayse. 20But as for me I am but poore, opprest and brought full lowe: Yet thou O Lorde wilt me restore, to health full well I know. 21For why thou art my hope and trust my refuge helpe and stay, Wherfore my God as thou art iust, with me no time delaye. Beatus qui intelligit. Psalm. xli. T.S. Dauid being greuously afflicted, blessed them that pitie his case, and complayneth of the treason of his owne frendes &amp; familiars, as came to passe in Iudas. Ioh. xv. After he felyng the great mercyes of god gently chastisyng him, and not suffring his ennemies to triumphe against him, geueth most hartye thankes vnto God. [1] The m? is blest y? careful is the nedie to c?sider. For in the season perilous, the lorde will him delyuer: [2]The lord wil make him safe and sound &amp; happy in the land: And he will not deliuer him, into his enemies hand. 3And in his bed when he lieth sicke, the Lord will him restore? And thou (O lord) will tourn to health his sicknes and his sore. 4Then in my sicknes thus say I, haue mercy Lord on me: And heale my soule whiche is full wo, that I offended thee. 5Mine enemies wished me ill in hart, and thus of me did say: When shall he die, that all his name, may vanish quite away? 6And when they come to visite me, they aske if I doo well: But in theyr harts mischief they hatche, and to their mates it tell: 7They bite theyr lippes and whisper so, as though they woulde me charme: And cast theyr fetches how to trappe me with some mortall harme. 8Some greuous sin, hath brought him to, this sicknes, say they playne: He is so low that without doubt, rise can he not agayne. 9The man also that I did trust, Actes .i.c. Heb. he lifte vp his hele against me, or vsed deceit and therfore Iacob had hys name by raking vp the heele and deceyuing. Gene. 15.d.17. with me did vse disceite: Who at my table eat my bread, the same for me layd wayte. 10Haue mercy Lorde on me therfore, and let me be preserude: That I may render vnto them, the things they haue deserude 11By this I know assuredly, to be beloued of thee: When that mine enemies haue no cause to triumph ouer me. 12But in my right thou hast me kept, and maintained alway: And in thy presence place assignde, where I shall dwell for aye. 12The Lorde the God of Israell, be praysed euermore: Euen so be it (Lord) will I say, euen so be it therfore. Quemadmodum desiderat. Psal. xlii. I.H. The Prophet greuously complayneth that being letted by his persecutours he could not be present in the congregation of Gods people, protesting, that although he was seperate in body from them: yet his harte was thither affectioned. And last of all he sheweth that he was not so far ouercomen with these sorowes and thoughtes, but that he continually put his confidence in the Lord. Sing this as the .xxxv. psa. [1] Like as the hart doth breath and bray, the well springs to obteyne: So doth my soule desire alway, with thee Lorde to remayne. 2My soule doth thirst &amp; would draw nere the liuing God of might: O when shall I come and appeare, in presence of his sight? 3The teares all times are my repast, which from mine eyes do slide: When wicked men cry out so fast, where nowe is God thy guide, 4Alas what grief is it to thinke, what fredome once I had? Therfore my soule as at pits brinke, is moste heauy and sad. When I did marche in good aray, furnished with my trayne: Unto the temple was our way, with songes and harts most fayne. 5My soule why art thou sad alwayes, and freatst thus in my brest? Trust still in God, for him to prayse, I holde it euer best. By him haue I succour at nede, against all payne and grief: He is my God which with all spede, will hast to sende relyef. 6And this my soule within me (Lorde) doth faint to thinke vpon: The lande of Iordan, and record, the little hill Hermon. 7One grief an other in doth call, as cloudes burst out theyr voyce.

[The first parte.] [1] All people herken and geue eare, To that that I shall tell: [2]Both high and low, both riche and poore that in the worlde doo dwell. 3For why? my mouth shall make discourse, of many thynges right wise: In vnderstanding shall my hart, his study exercise. 4I will inclyne myne eare to knowe, the parables so darke. And open all my doubtfull speache, in metre on my harpe. 5Why should I feare afflictions, or any carefull toyle? Or els my foes whiche at my heles, are prest my life to spoyle? 6For as for suche as ryches haue, wherin their trust is most: And they which of their treasures greate, them selues doo bragge and boast: 7There is not one of them that can, his brothers death redeme: Or that can geue a price to God, sufficient for hym. 8It is to great a pryce to pay, none can therto attayne: 9Or that he might his lyfe prolong, or not in graue remayne. 10They see wise men as well as foles, subiect vnto deathes handes: And beyng dead, straungers possesse, theyr goods, theyr rentes, their l?ds 11Theyr care is to builde houses fayre, and so determine sure: To make their name right great in earth for euer to endure. 12Yet shall no man alwayes enioy, high honor, wealth and rest: But shall at length fast of deathes cup, as well as the brute beast.

Their image, and theyr royall port, shall fade and quite decay: When as from house to pit they passe, with wo, and weale away. 15But God will surely preserue me, from death and endles payne: Because he will of his good grace, my soule receyue agayne. 16If any man waxe wonderous riche, feare not, I say, therfore, Although the glory of his house, increaseth more and more, 17For when he dieth, of all these thinges, nothing shall he receyue: His glory will not folow hym, his pompe will take her leaue. 18Yet in this lyfe he takth him selfe, the happiest vnder sunne: And others likewise flatter him, saying, all is well done. 19And presuppose he liue as long, as did his fathers olde: Yet must he nedes at length geue place: and be brought to deathes fold. 20Thus man to honor God hath calde, yet doth he not consider: But like brute beastes so dothe he lyue, whiche turne to dust and pouder. Deus deorum. Psalme L. I.H.

Syon hys faire place, hys glory bryght and cleare, The perfect beutye of his grace, from thence it did appeare. 3Our God shall come in haste, to speake he shall not doubte: Before him shall the fire waste, and tempest rounde aboute. 4The heauens from on hye, the earth below lyke wise: He will call forth to iudge and try, his folke he doeth deuise. 5Bring forth my sainctes (sayth he) my faithfull flocke so dere: Which are in band and league with me my lawe to loue and feare. 6And when these thinges are tried, the heauens shall recorde: That God is iust, and all must byde, the iudgment of the Lorde: 7My people O geue heede, Israell to thee I crye: I am thy God, thy healpe at neede, thou canst it not denye. 8I do not say to thee, thy sacrifice is slacke: Thou offrest dayly vnto me, muche more then I doo lacke. 9Thinkest thou that I doo nede, thy cattell yonge or olde: Or ells so muche desire to feede, on goates out of thy foulde. 10Naye, all the beastes are mine, in woodes that eate their filles: And thousands more, of nete and kine, that runne wilde in the hilles. 11The birdes that builde on hie, In hilles and oute of sight: And the beastes that in the filds do lye are subiect to my might. 12Then though I houngred sore, what neede I ought of thyne. Sith that the earth, with her great store and all therin is myne. 13To bullockes fleash haue I suche mind to eate it, doest thou thinke? Or such a sweetnes doo I finde, the bloude of goates to drinke. 14Geue to the Lorde his prayse, with thankes doo him apply: And see thou pay thy vowes alwaies, vnto the God most hie. 15Then seke and call to me, when ought would work thee blame. And I will sure deliuer thee, that thou maiest prayse my name. 16But to the wicked traine, whiche talke of God eche daye: And yet theyr works are foule and vain to them the Lorde will saye. 17With what a face darest thou, my worde once speake or name: Why doth thy taulke my lawe alowe, thy dedes denie the same. 18Where as for to amend, thy lyfe thou art so slacke: My word the which thou doest pretend is cast behind thy backe. 19When thou a thefe doest see, by theft to lyue in welthe: With him thou runnest, and dost agree, lykewyse to thryue by stealthe. 20When thou doest them beholde, that wiues and maides, defile: Thou likest it well, and waxest boulde, to vse that lyfe most vile. 21Thy lippes thou doest applye, to slaunder and defame: Thy tonge is taught to crafte and lye, and still doth vse the same. 22Thou studiest to reuile, thy frendes, to thee so nere: With sclaunder thou woldst nedes defile thy mothers sonne moste deare. 23Hereat while I doo winke, as though I did not see: Thou goest on still, and so dost thinke. that I am lyke to thee. 24But sure I will not let, to stryke when I beginne: Thy faultes in order I will set. and open all thy sinne. 25Matke this I you require, that haue not God in minde: Least when I plage you in myneire, your helpe be far to fynde. 26He that doth geue to me, the sacrifice of prayse: Doth please me well, and he shall see, to walke in Godly wayse.

Finally fearyng lest god would punish the whole churche for, hys faute: He requireth that he woulde rather increase his graces towardes the same. [The first parte.] [1] O Lord consider my distres.

Against thee, thee alone, I haue offended in thys case: And euell haue I done before the presence of thy face. That in the thynges that thou dost say, vpryght thou mayst be tryed: And eke in iudging, that the dome may passe vpon thy syde. Beholde in wickednes my kinde and shape I did receyue? And loe my sinfull mother eke in sinne did me conceiue. But Loe the truthe in inward partes, is pleasant vnto thee: And secretes of thy wisdome thou reueled hast to me. With hysope, Lorde, be sprincle me, I shalbe clensed so: Yea wash thou me, and so I shall be whiter than the snow. Of ioy and gladnes make thou me to heare the pleasing voyce: That so the broosed bones, which thou hast broken, may reioyce. From the beholding of my sinnes, Lorde turne away thy face: And all my dedes of wickednes, doo vtterly deface: O God creat in me a hart vnspotted in thy sight. And eke within my bowels, Lorde, renew a stable sprite. Ne cast me from thy sight, nor take thy holy sprite away: The comfort of thy sauing help, geue me againe, I pray: With thy free sprite establish me. And I will teache therfore, Sinners thy wayes, and wicked shall be turnde vnto thy lore. O God that art God of my health, from blood deliuer me: That prayses of thy righteousnes my tonge may syng to thee. My lippes that yet fast closed be, doo thou, O Lorde vnlose: The prayses of thy maiestie my mouth shall so disclose: I would haue offred sacrifice, if that had pleased thee. But pleased with burnt offringes: I knowe thou wilt not be. I trobled sprite is sacrifice delytefull in Gods eyes: A broken and an humbled hart, God, thou wilt not despise? In thy good will deale gently Lorde to Sion, and with all Graunt that of thy Ierusalem, vpreard may be the wall. Burnt offrings, giftes and sacrifice, of iustice in that day Thou shalt accept, and calues they shal vpon thyne altar lay. Quid gloriaris. Psalme. lii. I.H. Dauid describeth the arrogante tyrannye of hys aduersarye Doeg, Saules chief shepherde, who by false surmyses caused Achimelech with the rest of the priestes to be slain.

And fynally he rendreth thankes to God for his deliueraunce, In thys Psalme is lyuely set forthe the kingdome of Antichrist. [1] Why dost thou tyr?t boast abrode, thy wicked works to prayse: dost thou not knowe there is a God whose mercies last alwayes, [2]Why doth thy mind yet still deuise, suche wicked wiles to warpe? Thy song vntrue in forging lies, is like a rasour sharpe. 3On mischief why settest thou thy minde, and wilt not walke vpryght: Thou hast more lust false tales to fynde, then bryng the truth to lyght. 4Thou doest delyte in fraude and guile, in mischief blud and wrong: Thy lyppes haue learnde the flateryng style, O false deceitfull tonge. 5Therfore shall God for euer confounde, and pluck thee from thy place, Thy sede rote out from of the grounde, and so shall thee deface. 6The iust when they beholde thy fall, with feare will praise the Lorde: And in reproche of thee withall, cry out with one accorde. 7Behold the man which would not take the Lorde for his defence: But of his goods his God did make, and trust his corrupt sence. 8But I an Oliue fresh and grene, shall spring and sprede abrode: For why? my trust all times hathe bene, vpon the lyuing God. 9For this therfore will I geue prayse, to thee with hart and voyce: I will set forth thy name always, wherin thy sainctes reioyce. Dixit in sipiens. Psalme. Liii. T.N.

Sing this as the .xlv. psalme. The foolish man in that whyche he, within his hart hath sayde: That there is any God at all, hathe vtterly denyde. They are corrupt and they also, a haynous worke haue wrought: Amonge them all there is not one, of good that worketh ought. The Lorde loked downe on sons of men from Heuen all abrode: To see if any were that would. be wise and seke for God. They are gone all out of the way, they are corrupted all: There is not one doth any good, there is not one at all. Do not all wicked workers know, that they do fede vpon: My people as they fede on breade, the Lorde they call not on. Euen there they were afrayde and stode with trembling all dismayde Where as there was no cause at all, why they should be afrayde. For God his bones that thee beseged, hath scattered all abrode. Thou hast confounded them, for they reiected are of God. O Lorde geue thou thy people health, and thou, O Lord, fulfill: thy promise made to Israell, from out of Syon hill. When God his people shall restore, that erst was captiue lad, Thou Iacob shall therin reioyse and Israel shalbe glad. Deus in nomine. Psalm. Liiii. I.H.

With them by whom my soule is stayed the Lorde doth euer stande: 5With plages repay agayne all those, for me that lye in wayte: And with thy truth destroy my foes, with theyr owne snare and bayte, 6An offering of free hart and will, that I to thee shall make: And prayse thy name for therin still, greate comfort I doo take, 7O Lorde at length doo set me free, from them that craft conspire: And now mine eye with ioye doeth see, on them my hartes desire. Exaudi deus. Psalme, Lv. I.H.

[1] O God geue eare and do apply, To heare me when I praye: And when to thee I call and crye, hide not thy selfe awaye. 2Take hede to me, graunt my request, and aunswer me agayne: With playntes I pray, full sore opprest, greate grief doeth me constrayne. 3Because my foes with threates and cries, oppres me through despighte. And so the wicked sorte lykewise, to vex me haue delighte. 4For they in counsell doo conspire, to charge me with some ill: So in their hasty wrath and ire, they doo pursue me styll. 5My hart doth faynte for want of breathe, it panteth in my breste: The terroures and the dread of deathe, doo worke me muche vnrest. 6Suche dreadefull feare on me doth fall, that I therwith doo quake: Suche horror whelmeth me with all, that I no shift can make. 7But I doo saye: who will geue me, the swift and pleasaunte winges: Of some, fayer doue that I may flee, and rest me from these thinges. 8Lo then I woulde go farre awaye, to flye I woulde not cease, And I woulde hide my selfe and staye, in some greate wildernes. 9I would be gon in all the hast, and not abide behinde: That I weare quite and ouer past, these blasts of boisteous winde: 10Deuide them Lord, and from them pul, their diuilish double tounge: For I haue spied their citie full, of rapyne, stryfe, and wronge. 11Which things, bothe night &amp; day throghoute doo close her as a wall: In middes of her, is mischif stoute, and sorow eke with all. 12Her priuie partes, are wicked playne, her dedes are muche to vyle? And in her stretes there doth remayne, all crafty fraude and guile. 13If that my foes did seke my shame, I might it well abide: From open enmies checke and blame, some where I coulde me hide. 14But thou, it was my fellow dere, which frendship didest pretend: And diddest my secrete counsell here, as my famillier frende. 15With whom I had delight to taulke, in secret and abrode: And we together oft did walke, within the house of God. 16Let death in hast vpon them fall, and send them quicke to hell, For mischief rayneth in theyr hall, and parloure where they dwell. 17But I vnto my God doo crye, to him for healpe I flee: The Lorde doth heare me by and by, and he doeth succour me. 18At morning, noone, and euening tide, vnto the Lorde I praye: When I so instantly haue tryed he doth not say me naye. 19To peace he shall restore me yet, though warre be now at hande: All though the number be full greate, that would against me stande. 20The Lord, that first, &amp; last, doth raigne bothe now and euermore, Will heare when I to him complayne, and punish them full sore. 21For sure there is no hope that they, to tourne will once accorde: For why they will not God obey, nor doo not feare the Lorde, 22Upon their frends they laid theyr hands whiche weare in couenaunt knitte. Of frendship to neglect the bandes, they passe or care no whyt. 23While they haue war within their hart as butter are theyr wordes: Although his words wer smothe as oyle they cut as sharp as swordes. 24Cast thou thy care vpon the Lorde, and he shall nourish thee: For in no wise wyll he accorde, the iust in thrall to see. 25But God shall cast them deepe in pit, that thirst for bloud alwayes: He will no guilefull man permit, to lyue oute halfe hys dayes. 29Thoughe such be quite destroyde &amp; gon in the (O Lorde) I trust: I shall depende thy grace vpon, with all my hart and luste.

I well perceaue it by that same, that God doeth take my parte: 10I glory in the worde of God, to prayse it I accorde: With Ioye will I declare abrode, the promise of the Lore. 11I trust in God and yet I saye, as I afore beganne: The Lorde he is my healpe and stay, I doo not care for man. 12I will performe with hart so free, to God my vowes alwayes: And I O Lorde all times to thee, will offer thankes and prayse. 13My soule fr? death thou dost me def?d and keepe my feete vpright: That I before thee may ascend. with suche as lyue in lyght.

Ephraim the strength of all my lande, my law dothe Iuda guide: 8In Moab I will wash my feete, ouer Edom throw my shoo: And thou Palestine oughtst to seke, for fauoure me vnto. 9But who will brynge me at thys tyde, vnto the citie stronge: Or who to Edom will me gide, so that I goo not wronge. 10Wilt thou my God which didst forsake thy folke, theyr land and costes: Our warres in h?d, thou woldst not take. nor walke amonge our hostes. 11Geue ayde O Lorde, and vs releue, from them that vs disdayne: The healp that hostes of men can geue it is but all in vayne. 12But through our God, we shall haue might to take great things in hand: He will treade downe and put to flight all those that vs withstand.

In this Psalm Dauid setteth forth as in a glas, the wonderfull free mercyes of God towardes his people, who by all meanes, and moste straunge sorts declareth him self to them. And therfore Gods church by reason of his promises, graces and victoryes, doth excell without comparyson al worldly thyngs: he exhorteth therfore all men to praise God for euer. [The first parte.] [1] Let God aryse, and then his foes, wil turn them selues to flyght: His enmies then will runne abrode, and scatter out of syght, [2]&amp; as the fire doth melt y? wax, &amp; wind blow smoke awaye: so in the presence of y? lord, the wicked shal decay 3But righteous men before the Lorde, shall hartely reioyce: They shalbe glad and mery all, and chearefull in their voice. 4Sing prayse, sing prayse vnto the Lord who rideth on the skie: Extoll this name of Iah our God, and him do magnifie: 5That same is he that is aboue, within his holy place: That father is of fatherles, and iudge of widowes case. 6Houses he geuth and issue bothe, vnto the comfortles He bringeth bondmen out of thrall, and rebelles to distres. 7When thou diddest march before thy folk the Egiptians from among: And brought th? through the wildernes, whiche was both wide and long 8Thearth did quake, y? rain powred downe heard were great claps of thunder, The mount Sinai shoke in such sort, as it would cleaue a sunder. 9Thine heritage with drops of rayne, aboundantly was washt: And if so be it baren waxt, by thee it was refresht. 10Thy chosen flock doth there remayne, thou hast preparde that place: And for the pore thou dost prouide, of thine especiall grace. The second parte. 11God will geue women causes iust, to magnifye his name: When as his people triumphes make, and purchase brut and fame. 12For puissant kinges for all their power shall flee and take the foyle. And women whiche remayne at home, shall helpe to part the spoyle. 13And though you were as black as pots, Or triuets.your hew should pas the doue: whose winges and fethers seme to haue, siluer and gold aboue. 14when in this land God shall triumphe, ouer kynges bothe hyge and lowe, Then shall it be lyke Salmon hyll, as whyte as any snowe. The church of God doth excel all worldly thinges not in outward pomp but by the grace of God whyche there remaynth because of his promise. 15Though Basan be a frutefull hyll, and in heyght others pas: Yet Sion Gods most holy hyll, doth farre excell in grace. 16Why brag ye thus, ye hils most high, and leape for pride together? This hill of Sion God doth loue, and there will dwell for euer. 17Gods army is two millions, of warriours good and strong: The Lorde also in Sinai, is present them among. 18Thou didst (O Lord) ascend on high, and captiues led them all: whiche in times past thy chosen flock, in prison kept and thrall. God toke not taxes to enriche himselfe, but to bestow them on his churche and therfore in the iiii. to thephe. S. Paule saith he gaue gifts, folowing the grek translati? Selath.Thou madst them tribute for to paye, and suche as did repine. Thou didst subdue that they might dwell, in thy temple deuine. 19Now praysed be the Lord for that, he powreth on vs suche grace: From day to day, he is the God, of our health and solace. The thirde parte. 20He is the God from whom alone, saluation commeth playne: He is the God by whom we scape: all daungers death and payne. 21Thus god wil wound his enemies head and breake the heary scalpe: Of those that in theyr wickednes, continually doo walke. 22From Basan will I brynge (sayd he) my people and my shepe: He meanth the victory whiche Dauid had of Og. king of Basan. And all mine owne as I haue done, from daunger of the depe, 23And make them dip theyr fete in bloud, of those that hate my name: And dogs shal haue theyr tongs embrude with licking of the same. 24All men may see how thou (O God) thyne enemies dost deface: And how thou goest as God and kyng, into thy holy place. 25The singers goo befrre with ioy, the minstrels folow after: And in the midst the damsels play, with timbrell and with taber. 26Now in thy congregations, (O Israell) prayse the Lord: And Iacobs whole posteritie, geue thankes with one accorde. Because he was the y?gest of the Patriarches Iacobs sonnes, he calleth hym lytell Beniamin. 27Their chief was little Beniamin, but Iuda made theyr host: With Zabulon, and Neptalim, whiche dweld about theyr cost, 28As God hathe geuen powre to thee, so Lorde make firme and sure: The thing that thou hast wrought in vs for euer to indure. 29And in thy temple giftes will we, geue vnto thee (O Lorde: for thyne vnto Ierusalem, sure promise made by word. The forthe parte. Yea and straunge kings to vs subdued shall doo lyke in those dayes: I meane to thee they shall present, theyr gifts of laude and prayes, 30He shall destroy the spear mens rancks these calues and bulles of myght: And cause them tribute pay, and daunt, all suche as loue to fyght. 31Then shall the Lordes of Egipt come, and presents with them bryng: The mores most black shall stretch their h?ds vnto their lord and king. 32Therfore ye kingdomes of the earth, geue prayse vnto the Lorde: Sing Psalmes to God with one c?sent, therto let all accorde. 33Who though he ryde and euer hath, aboue the heauens bryght: Yet by the fearfull thunder claps, men may well know hys myght. 34Therfore the strength of Israell, ascribe to God on hie: Whose mighte and power doth far ext?d aboue the cloudy skye. 35O God thy holines and power, is dread for euermore: The God of Israell geueth vs strength, praysed be God therfore. Saluum me fac domine. Psalm. lxix. I.H. The complayntes, prayers, feruent zele, and great anguish of Dauid is set forth as a figure of Chryst, and all hys membres: the malicious crueltye of thenemies, and theyr punishment also where Iudas and suche traytours are accursed. Then gathered he courage in hys affliction and offereth prayses vnto God, whych are more acceptable then all sacrifyces: wherof all the afflicted may take comforte. Finallye he doth prouoke all creatures to prayses, prophecying of the kyngdome of Chryst, and the buildyng of Iuda, where all the faythful and their sede shall dwell for euer: [The first parte.] [1] Saue me, O God &amp; that with spede, the waters flowe full fast: So nie my soule doo they procede that I am sore agast. [2]I sticke full depe in filthe and clay, wheras I fele no ground: I fall into suche flouds, I say, that I am like be drounde. 3With crying oft I faynt and quayle, my throte is horse and drye: With loking vp my sight doth fayle, for helpe to God on hye. 4My foes that giltles doo oppres. my soule, with hate are led: In number sure they are no les, then heares are on my hed. 5Though for no cause they vexe me sore they prosper and are glad: They doo compell me to restore, the thynges I neuer had. 6What I haue done for want of wit, thou Lorde all times canst tell: And all the same that I commit, to thee is knowne ful well. 7O God of hostes defend and staye, al those that trust in thee: Let no man doubt or shrink awaye, for ought that chaunceth me, 8It is for thee and for thy sake, that I doo beare this blame: In spite of thee they would me make, to hyde my face for shame. 9My mothers sonnes my brethern all, forsake me on a rowe: And as a straunger they me call, my face they will not knowe. 10vnto thy house suche zeale I beare, that it doth pine me muche: Theyr checks &amp; taunts at thee to heare my very hart doth grutch. The second parte. 11Though I doo fast my flesh to chaste, yea if I wepe and mone: Yet in my teath this geare is cast, they passe not thereupon. 12If I for grief, and payne of hart, in sackcloth vse to walke: Then they anone will it peruert, therof they iest and talke. 13Both hie and lowe, and all the throng, that sit within the gate: They haue me euer in theyr tong, of me they talke and prate. 14The dronkards whiche in wine delyte it is their cheif pastime: To seke whiche may to worke me spite, of me they sing and rime, 15But thee the whyle (O Lorde) I pray, that when it pleaseth thee. For thy great truth thou wilt alwaye, sende downe thyne ayde to me. 16Pluck thou my feete out of the myre, from drowning doo me kepe: From suche as owe me wrath and ire, and from the waters depe. 17Lest with y? waues I should be drownd and depth my soule deuouer: And that the pit should me confound, and shut me in her power. 18O Lorde of hostes to me geue eare, as thou arte good and kynde. And as thy mercy is most deare, Lorde haue me in thy mynde. 19And doo not from thy seruaunt hyde, nor turne thy face awaye: I am opprest on euery syde, in hast geue eare I say. 20O Lorde vnto my soule draw nye, the same with ayde repose: Because of theyr great tyrannye, acquite me fro my foes. The thirde parte. 21That I abide rebuke and shame, thou knowest and thou canst tell: For those that seke and worke the same, thou seest them all full well. 22When they with brags doo breake my hart I seke for helpe anone. But finde no frendes to ease my smarte, to comfort me not one, 23But in my meate they gaue me gall, to cruell for to thynke: And gaue me in my thirst withall, stronge vineger to dryncke. 24Lorde turne their table to a snare, to take them selues therin. And when they thinke full well to fare, then trap them in the gin. 25And let theyr eyes be darke and blynde that they may nothyng see: Bow downe their back &amp; doo th? binde, in thraldome for to be. 26Powre out thy wrath as hoate as fyer, that it on them may fal: Let thy displeasure in thyne yre: take holde vpon them all. As desert drye theyr house disgrace, their offring eke expell: 27That none therof posses their place, nor in their tents doo dwell: If thou dost strike the man to tame, on him they lay full sore. 28And if that thou do wounde the same, they seke to hurt him more: Then let them heape vp mischief still. sith they are all peruert: 29That of thy fauor and good will, they neuer haue no part. And dash them cleane out of the boke, of life, of hope of trust: That for their names they neuer loke, in number of the iust. The forth parte. 31Though I, O Lorde, with wo &amp; grief, haue bene full sore opprest? Thy helpe shall geue me suche relief, that all shall be redrest. 32That I may geue thy name the prayse, and shew it with a song: I will extoll the same alwayes, with harty thankes among. 33Which is more pleasant vnto thee, (Such minde thy grace hath borne:) Then either Oxe, or Calfe can be, that hath bothe hoofe and horne. 34When simple folke doo this beholde, it shall reioyce them sure: All ye that seke the Lorde, beholde, your lyfe for aye shall dure. 35For why the Lord of hosts doth heare, the poore when they complayne: His prisoners are to him full deare, he doth them not disdayne. 36wherfore the skie and earth belowe, The sea with floud and stream: His prayse they shall declare and showe with all that liue in them. 37For sure our God will Sion saue, and Iudaes cities builde: 38Much folke possession there shall haue, her streate shall all be filde. Her seruaunts sede shall kepe the same, all ages out of minde, 39And there all they that loue hys name. a dwellyng place shall fynde. Deus in adiutorium. Psalme. lxx. I.H. He prayeth to be ryght spedely delyuered as in the .lx. Psalm. Then he desireth the shame of hys enemyes, and the ioyfull comforte of all those that seke the Lorde. Sing this as the .lxxii. ps. [1] O God, to me take hede. of helpe I thee require: O Lorde of hosts with hast and spede helpe, helpe, I thee desire. 2With shame confound them all, that seke my soule to spill. Rebuke them backe with blame to fall that thinke and wish me ill. 3Confounde them that applye, and seke to worke me shame: And at my harme, do laugh and crye, so, so, there goth the game. 4But let them ioyfull be, in thee with ioy and wealth: Which only trust and seke to thee, and to thy sauing health. 5That they may say alwayes, in mirth and one accorde: All glory, honor, laude and prayse, be geuen to thee (O Lorde.) 6But I am weake and poore, come Lorde thine ayde I lacke: Thou art my stay and helpe therfore, make spede and be not slack. In te domine speraui. Psalm. lxxi. I.H. He prayeth in fayth establyshed by the worde of the promise, and confirmed by the worke of God, from his youth he desireth now to be deliuered from the wicked and cruell man (meanyng) his sonne Absol?, and his confederacy, and he promiseth to be mindefull and thankefull for the same. Sing this as the .lxix. psa. [The first parte.] [1] My Lorde, my God in all distres, my hope is whole in thee: Then let no shame my soule oppres, nor once take holde on me. 2As thou art iust defend me Lorde, and rid me out of drede: Geue eare, and to my suite accorde, and send me helpe at nede. 3Be thou my rock, to whom I may, for ayde all times resort: Thy promise is to helpe alwaye, thou art my fence and fort. 4Saue me my God, from wicked men, and from theyr strength and powre: From folke vniuste, and eke from them, that cruelly deuoure, 5Thou art the stay wherin I trust, thou Lorde of hosts art he: Yea from my youth I had a lust, still to depend on thee. 6Thou hast me kept euen from my birth and I through thee was borne: wherfore I will thee prayse with mirth, bothe euening and morne. 7As to a monster seldome seen, muche folke about me thronge: But thou art now and still hast bene, my fence and ayde so stronge. 8Wherfore my mouth no time shall lacke, thy glory and thy prayse: And eke my tong shall not be slack, to honor thee alwayse. 9Refuse not me, O Lorde, I say, when age my limmes doth take: And when my strength doth wast away doo not my soule forsake. 10Amonge themselues my foes enquire, to take me through deceyt: And they agaynst me doo conspire, that for my soule layd wayt: The second parte. 11Lay hand and take hym now they sayd for God from him is gone: Dispatch him quyte, for to hys ayde, iwis there commeth none. 12Doo not absent thy self away, O Lorde, when nede shalbe: But that in time of grief thou may, in hast geue helpe to me. 13With shame confound and ouerthrowe, all those that seke my lyfe: Oppres them with rebukes also, that fayne would worke me stryfe, 14But I wil patienly abide, thy helpe in all assayes: Still more and more eche time and tide I will set forth thy prayse. 15My mouth thy iustice shall recorde, that dayly helpe doth sende: But of thy benefyts, O Lorde, I knowe no compt nor ende. 16Yet will I goo and seke forth one, with thy Good helpe (O God) The sauing health of thee alone, to shew and set abrode. 17For of my youth thou tokest the care, and dost instruct me styll: Therfore thy wonders to declare, I haue great minde and will. 18And as in youth from wanton rage, thou didst me kepe and stay: Forsake me not vnto mine age, and tyll my head be gray. 19That I thy strength &amp; might may show to them that now be here: And that our sede thy power may know hereafter many a yere. 20O Lord thy iustice doth excede, thy doinges all may see: Thy workes are wonderfull in dede, oh, who is lyke to thee? 21Thou madest me fele afflictions sore, and yet thou didst me saue: Yea thou didst helpe and me restore, and take me from the graue. 23And thou mine honor dost encrease, my dignitie maintayne: Yea thou dost make all grief to cease, and comfort me agayne: 24Therfore thy faithfulnes to prayse, I will bothe lute and sing: My harp shall sound thy laude alwayes O Israels holy king. 25My mouth will ioy with pleasant voyce when I shall sing to thee: And eke my soule will muche reioyce, for thou hast made me free. 26My tonge thy vprightnes shall sounde, and speake it dayly still: For grief and shame do them confounde, that sought to worck me ill. Deus iudicium tuum. Psal. lxxi. I.H. He prayeth that the kingdom of God by Christ may come vnder the parson of Salomon vnder whom shall be rightuousnes, peace &amp; felicitie, vnto whom all kinges, and all nations shall doo homage, whose name and power shall indure for euer. [The first parte.] [1] Lord geue thy iudgm?ts to the kyng, therin instruct him well: And with his sonne that Princely thyng. Lorde let thy iustyce dwell. [2]That he may gouerne vp ryghtly, And rule thy folke a ryghte: and so defende throughe equitie, the poore that haue no myght. 3And let the mountains that are hye, vnto their folke geue peace, And eke let litle hils applye, in iustice to encrease. 4That he may help the weake and pore, with ayde and make them stronge: And eke destroy for euermore, all those that doo them wrong. 5And then from age to age shall they, regarde and feare thy might: So long as Sunne doth shine by daye, or els the moone by night. 6Lorde make the king vnto the iust, like rayne to fields new mowen: And like to droppes that lay the dust, and fresh the land vnsowen. 7The iust shall florish in his time, and all shalbe at peace: Untill the mone shall leaue to prime, wast, chaunge, and to encrease, 8He shalbe Lorde of sea and sand, from shore to shore throughout: And from the flouds within the land, through all the earth about. 9The people that in desert dwell, shall knele to him full thick: And all hys enemies that rebell, the earth and dust shall lyck. 10Their Lordes of all the yles therby, great giftes to him shall bryng: The kings of Sabe and Arabie, geue many a costly thyng. The second parte. 11All kinges shall seke with one accord, in his good grace to stand: And all the people of the world, shall serue him at his hande. 12For he the neady sort doth saue, that vnto him doo call, And eke the simple folke that haue, no helpe of man at all, 13He taketh pitie on the poore, that are with nede opprest. He doth preserue them euermore, and bring their soules to rest. 14He shall redeme theyr lyfe from dread, from fraud, fom wrong, from might: And eke the bloud that they shall blead, is precious in his sight. 15But he shall lyue and they shall bryng, to him of Sabaes golde? He shalbe honored as a kyng and dayly be extold. 16The mightie mountaines of his land, of corne shall beare such throng: That it lyke Cedre trees shal stand, in Libanus full long, 17Their cities eke full well shall spede: the frutes therof shall pas: In plenty it shall far excede, and spring as grene as grasse. 18For euer they shall prayse his name, while that the sunne is lyght: And think them happy through the same all folke shall bles his myght. 19Praise ye the Lord of hostes and sing, to Israels God eche one: For he doth euery wondrous thing, yea he him self alone. 20And blessed be his holy name, all times eternally: That all the earth may prayse the same, Amen, Amen, say I. Quam bonus deus. Psal. lxxiii. T.S. The prophet teacheth by his example, that neyther the worldly prosperitie of the vngodlye, nor yet the affliction of the good, ought to discourage Gods children: but rather ought to moue vs to consider oure fathers prouidence, and to cause vs to reuerence Gods iudgementes for asmuche as the wicked vanysh away like smoke, and the vngodly enter into lyfe euerlastyng, in hope wherof he resigneth himselfe into Gods handes. Sing this as the .xliiii. psalme. [The first parte.] [1] How euer it be, yet God is good, and kynde to Israell: And to all suche as safely kepe, theyr conscience pure and well. 2Yet lyke a foole I almost slypt, my feete began to slide: And or I wist euen at a pinch, my steps a wrye gan glyde. 3For when I saw suche folysh men, I grudge and did disdayne: That wicked men all thinges should haue, without turmoyle or payne. 4They neuer suffer panges nor grief, as if death shoulde them smite: Theyr bodyes are bothe stoute and strong, and euer in good plyte. 5And free from all aduersitie, when other men be shent: And with the rest they take no parte, of plague or punishment, 6Therfore presumption doth embrace, theyr necks as doth a chayne: And are euen wrapt as in a robe, with rapine and disdaine. 7They are so fed, that euen for fat, their eyes oft times out start: And as for worldly goodes they haue. more then can wish theyr hart, 8Theyr lyfe is moste licentious, boastyng muche of the wrong: Which they haue done to simple men, and euer pryde among. 9The heauens and the lyuing Lorde, they spare not to blaspheme: And prate they doo on worldly thynges, no wight they doo esteme. 10The people of God, oft times turne backe, to see theyr prosprous state: And almost drynke the selfe same cup, and folow the same rate. The second parte. 11How can it be that God (say they) should know and vnderstand: These worldly thinges since wicked men, be Lordes of sea and land? 12For we may see how wicked men, in riches still increase: Rewarded well with worldly goodes, and lyue in rest and peace. 13Then why doo I from wickednes, my fantasy refrayne: And wash my handes with innocentes. and clense my hart in vayne? 14And suffer scourges euery day, as subiect to all blame: And euery mornyng from my youth, susteyne rebuke and shame? 15And I had almost sayd as they, misliking mine estate: But that I should thy children iudge, as folke vnfortunate. 16Then I bethought me how I might, thys matter vnderstande: But yet the labor was to great, for me to take in hand, 17Untill the tyme I went into, thy holy place, and then, I vnderstode right perfectly, the ende of all these men. 18And namely how thou settest them, vpon a slippery place: And at thy pleasure and thy wyll, thou dost them all deface. 19Then all men muse at that straung sight to see how sodenly: They are destroid, dispatche, consumde and dead so horribly. 20Much like a dreame when one awakth so shall theyr wealth decay: Theyr famous names in all mens sight shall ebbe and pas a way. The thirde parte. 21Yet thus my hart was greued then, my minde was much opprest: 23So fond was I and ignorant, and in this point abeast, 23Yet neuertheles by my right hand, thou holdest me alwayes fast: 24And with my counsell dost me guyde, to glory at the last. 25What thyng is there that I can wishe, but thee in heauen aboue? And in the earth there is nothyng, lyke thee that I can loue. 26My flesh and eke my hart do fayle, but God doth fayle me neuer: For of my hart God is the strength, my portion eke for euer. 27And lo, all suche as thee forsake, thou shalt destroy eche one: And those that trust in any thyng, sauing in thee alone. 28Therfore will I draw nere to God, and euer with him dwell, In God alone I put my trust, thy wonders will I tell. Vt quid deus. Psalme. lxxiiii. I.H. The faythfull complayne of the destruction of the church and true relygyon, vnder the name of Sion and the aultars destroyed: And trustyng in the myght and free mercyes of God, by hys couenaunt they require help and succor for the glory of Gods holy name, the saluatyon of his pore afflicted seruaunts &amp; the c?fusion of his proud enemies Sing this as the .lxxii. ps. [The first parte.] [1] Why art thou Lorde so longe from vs, in all this daunger depe? Why doth thine anger kindle thus, at thyne owne pasture shepe? 2Lorde call the people to thy thought, which haue ben thine so long: The which thou hast redemd &amp; brought, from bondage sore and strong. 3Haue minde and thinke vpon, remember it full well: Thy pleasant place thy mount Sion, where thou wast wont to dwell. 4Lift vp thy fote and come in hast, and all thy foes deface: Whiche now at pleasure rob and wast within thy holy place. 5Amid thy congregations all, thine enemies roare (O God: They set as signes on euery wall, theyr banners splayde abrod. 6As men with axes hew the trees, that on the hils do grow: So shine the bils and swords of these, within thy temples now. 7The selings sawde, the carued bordes, the godly grauen stones: With axces, hammers, billes &amp; swordes they beate them downe at ones. 8Thy places they consume with flame, and eke in all this toile: The house appointed to thy name, they race downe to the soyle. 9And thus they sayde within theyr hart, dispatche them out of hand: Then burnt they vp in euery part, Gods houses through the land 10Yet thou no signe of helpe dost sende, our Prophets all are gone: To tell when this our plage shuld ende among vs there is none. 11Wh? wilt thou lord once end this shame and cease thyne enemies strong: Shall they alway blaspheme thy name and rayle on thee so long? 12Why dost with draw thy hand a backe? and hide it in thy lappe: O pluck it out and be not slack, to geue thy foes a rappe. The second part. 13O God thou art my kyng and Lorde, and euermore hast ben: Yea thy good grace throughout the world for our good helpe hathe seen. 14The seas that are so depe and dead, thy might did make them drye: And then didst breake the serpents head, that he therin did dye. 15Yea thou didst breake the heads so great of whales that are so fell: And gauest them to the folkes to eate, that in the desertes dwell. 16Thou madest a spring with streames to rise from rock both hard and hye: And eke thy hand hath made lyke wyse, depe riuers to be drye. 17Bothe day and eke the night are thyne, by thee they were begonne, Thou settest to serue vs with theyr shine, the light and eke the sunne, 18Thou doest appoint the endes and costs of all the earth about: Both sommer heates, and winter frosts, thy hand hath founde them out. 19Thinke on (O Lorde) no time forget. thy foes that thee defame: And how the folish folke are set, to rayle vpon thy name. 20O let no cruell beast deuoure, thy Turtle that is true: Forget not alwayes in thy powre, the poore that much doo rue. 21Regarde thy couenaunt and beholde, thy foes posses, the lande: All sad and darke, forworne and old, our realme as now doth stand. 22Let not the simple go away, with disapointed shame: But let the poore and nedye aye. geue prayse vnto thy name. 23Ryse Lord, let be by thee mainteined, the cause that is thyne owne: Remember how that thou, blasphemde, art by the folysh one. 24The voyce forget not of thy foes, for they presumyng hie: Is more and more encreast of those, that hate thee spitefully. Confitebimur tibi deus. Psalm. lxxv. N. The faythfull doo prayse the name of the Lord whiche shall come to iudge at the time appoynted, when the wicked shal be put to confusion, and drynke of the cup of his wrath, theyr prayer shall be abated, &amp; the righteous shall be exalted to honor. Sing this as the .xliiii. psalme. [1] Vnto the God we will geue thankes, we will geue thankes to thee. Sith thy name is so nere, declare, thy wondrous workes will we. 2I will vprightly iudge, when get, conuenient tyme I may. The earth is weake and all therin: but I her pillers stay. 3I did to thee mad people say, deale not furiouslye: And vnto the vngodliones, set not your hornes so hie. 4I sayd vnto them, set not vp, your raysed hornes on hye, And see that you doo with stiffe neck, not speake presumptuously. 5For neyther from the eastern part, nor from the westernside, Nor from forsaken wildernes, protection doth procede. 6For why the Lorde our God, he is, the righteous iudge alone: He putteth downe the one, and sets another in the throne. 7For why? a cup of myghtye wyne, is in the hand of God: And all the myghtye wyne therin, him self doth poure abrode. 8As for the lees and filthy dregges, that doo remayne of it. The wicked of the earth shall drinke, and suck them euery whyt. 9But I will talke of God (I say) of Iacobs God therfore: And will not cease to celebrate, his prayse for euermore. 10In sunder breake the hornes of all, vngodly men will I: But then the hornes of righteous men, shalbe exalted hye. Gloria patri. To father, sonne, and holy ghost, all glory be therfore: As in beginning was, is now, and shalbe euermore. In Iudea. Psalme. Lxxvi. I.H. This Psalme setteth forthe the power of God and care for the defence of hys people in Ierusalem, in the destruction of the armie Senacherib: And exhorteth the faythfull to be thankefull for the same. Sing this as the .lxix. psa. [1] To all that now in Iury dwell, the Lorde is clerly knowen: His name is great in Israell, a people of his owne. 2At Salem he his tents hath pighte, to tary there a space: In sion eke he hathe delyghte, to make his dwellyng place. 3And there he brake bothe shaft and bow the sworde the speare and shilde: And brake the ray to ouerthrowe, in battell on the fielde. 4Thou arte more worthy honour, Lord, more mighte in thee dothe lye: Then in the strongest of the worlde, that rob on mountayes hye. 5But now y? proud are spoyled through the and they are fallen on sleepe: Through men of warre no helpe can be them selues they coulde not kepe. 6At thy rebuke (O Iacobs God, when thou doost them reprone: As halfe in slepe theyr charets, stoode, no horsman once doth moue. 7For thou arte fearfull Lorde in dede, what man the corage hathe: To bide thy sight and doth not dreede, when thou art in thy wrath. 8Wh? thou dost make thy iudgm?ts hard from heauen through the grounde: Then al the earth, full sore, afearde. in silence shalbe founde. 9And that when thou O God dost stand in iudgement for to speake: To saue thafflicted of the lande, on earth that are full weake, 10The fury that in man doth raygne, shall tourne vnto thy prayse: Hereafter Lorde doo thou restrayne, theyr wrath and threates alwayes, 11Make voues &amp; paye them to your God, ye folke that nigh him bee: Bring giftes all ye that dwell abrode, for dreedfull sure is he. 12For he doth take bothe lyfe and might. from Princes great of birth: And full of terroure is hys sighte, to all the kinges on earth. Voce mea ad dominum. Psalm. lxxvii. I.H. The Prophet in the name of the churche, rehearseth the greatnes of his affliction, and his greuous temptation, wherby he was driuen to thys end to consider his formore conuersacion, &amp; the continuall cours of Gods worckes in the preseruation of his seruauntes, and so he confirmeth his fayth agaynst these temptacyons. [1] I with my voyce to God do cry, with harte and harty cheare, my voyce to God I lyfte on hyghe and he my sute doth heare, [2]in tyme of grief I sought to God, by nyght no rest I toke: But stretcht my hands to him abrode, my soule comfort forsoke. 3When I to thinke one God entend, my troble then is more: I spake but could not make an ende, my breath was stopt so sore. 4Thou houldst myne eys alwayse from rest, that I alwayes awake: With feare am I so sore opprest, my speche doeth me forsake. 5The dayes of olde in minde I cast. and oft did thinke vpon: The times and ages that are past, full many yeares agon. 6By night my songes I call to mynde, once made thy prayse to shew: And with my hart, much taulke I finde, my spirites doth searche to knowe. 7Will God (sayd I) at once for all, cast of his people thus? So that henceforthe no time he shall, be frendly vnto vs. 8What, is hys goodnes cleane decayed, for euer and aday? Or is hys promise now delayde, and doeth his truthe decaye? 9And will the Lorde our God forget, his mercyes manifolde: Or shall his wrath encrease so whot, his mercy to with holde: 10At last I sayde my weakenes is, the cause of this mistrust. Gods mighty hand, can healpe all thys, and chaunge it, when he lust. 11I will regarde, and thinke vpon, the workyng of the Lorde: Of all his wonders past and gone, I gladly will recorde. 12Yea all his workes I will declare, and what he did deuise: To tell his factes I will not spare, and eke his counsell wyse. 13Thy workes (O Lorde) are all vprghit and holy all abrod: What one, hath str?gth to match y? mighte of thee O Lorde our God. 14Thou art a God, that oft dost show, thy wonders euery hower: And so doest make the people knowe, thy vertue and thy power. 15And thine owne folke thou diddest def?d with strength and stretched arme? The sonnes of Iacob that discend, and Iosephes seede from harme. 16The waters, Lorde perceued thee, the waters saw thee well: And they for feare a side did flee, the depthes on trembling fell. 17The clouds that were, both thick &amp; black did rayne full plenteously: The thonder in the ayer did cracke, thy shaftes abrode did flye. 18Thy thunder in the fire was hearde, the lightening from aboue, With flashes greate made men afearde, the earth did quake and moue. 19Thy wayes within the sea do lye, thy pathe in waters depe: Yet none can there, thy steppes espye. nor know thy pathe to kepe. 20Thou leadest thy folke vpon the lande, as shepe on euery syde: Through Moses &amp; through Aarons hand thou didst them safely gide. Attendite popule. Psal. lxxviii. T.S. He sheweth how God of his mercy chose hys church of the posteritie of Abraham, castyng in theyr teth the stubburne rebellion of theyr fathers that the children might not only vnderstand, that god of his fre mercies made his couenant with theyr auncestors, but also seyng th? so malitious and peruerse, might be ashamed &amp; so turn wholy to god. In this Psalme the holy Ghost hathe comprehended, as it were the sum of all Gods benefites, to thintent the ignoraunt and gros people mighte see in few wordes the effect of the whole historyes. [The first parte.] [1] Attend my people to my law &amp; to my wordes inclyne. [2]My mouthe shall speake straunge parables, and sentences deuyne. [3]Which we our selues haue hard &amp; lernd, euen of oure fathers olde, &amp; whiche for our instruction our fathers haue vs tolde. 4Because we shoulde not kepe it close, from them that shoulde come after. Who should Gods power to theyr race praise, and all his workes of wonder. 5To Iacob he commaundment gaue, how Israell should lyue: Willyng our fathers shoulde the same, vnto theyr children geue. 6That they and theyr posterytie, that were not sprong vp tho: Should haue the knowledge of the law, and teache theyr seede also. 7That they may haue the better hope, in God that is aboue: And not forget to kepe his lawes, and his precepts in loue. 8Not beyng as theyr fathers were, rebellyng in Gods syght: And would not frame their wicked harts to know theyr God a ryght. 9How went the people of Ephraim, theyr neyghbours for to spoyle? Shoting their dartes the day of warre, and yet they toke the foyle. 10For why? they did not kepe with God, the couenant that was made: Nor yet would walk or leade their liues, according to his trade. 11But put into obliuion, his counsell and his will: And all his workes most magnifique, which he declared styll. The second parte. 12What wonders to our forefathers, did he him selfe disclose: In Egipt land, within the field, that called is Thaneos? 13He did deuyde, and cut the sea, that they might pas at once: And made the water stand as styll, as doth an heape of stones, 14He led them secret in a cloud, by day when it was bryght: And in the night when darke it was, with fire he gaue them lyght. 15He brake the rocks in wildernes, and gaue the people drynk: As plentifull as when the depes, doo flow vp to the brynk. 16He drew out riuers out of rockes, that were bothe drye and harde: Of suche aboundaunce that no floudes, to them might be compard. 17Yet for all this, against the Lorde, theyr sinne they did increase: And styred hym that is most hygh, to wrath in wildernes. 18They tempted hym within theyr harts, lyke people of mistrust: Requiring such a kynd of meate, as serued to theyr lust. 19Saying with murmuration, in theyr vnfaythfulnes: What can this God prepare for vs, a feast in wildernes? 20Beholde, he strake the stony rock, and floudes forthwith did flo: But can he now geue to his folke, bothe breade and flesh also? 21When God hard this, he waxed wroth with Iacob and his sede: So did his indignation, on Israell procede. The thirde parte. 22Because they did not faithfully, beleue and hope that he: Could alwayes help and succor them, in theyr necessitie. 23Wherfore he did commaund the clouds forthwith they brake in sundre: 24And raind down Manna for th? to eate a foode of mickell wondre. 25When earthly men with angels fode, were fed at theyr request: 26He bad the east wynde blow away, and brought in the south west. 27And raind downe flesh as thick as dust and foule as thick as sand: 28Whiche he did cast amids the place, where all the tents did stand. 29Then did they eate excedingly, and all men had theyr fils: Yet more and more they did desire, to serue theyr lusts and wils. 30But as the meate was in theyr mouthes his wrath vpon them fell? 31And slew the floure of all theyr youth, and choyse of Israell. 32Yet fell they to theyr wonted sinne, and still they did him greue: For all the wonders that he wrought. they would him not beleue. 33Theyr dayes therfore he shortned, and made theyr honor vayne: Theyr yeares did wast and pas away, with terrours and with payne. 34But euer when he plaged them, they sought hym by and by: 35Rem?bring then, he was their strength, theyr help and God most hye. 36Thoughe in their mouthes they did but glose and flatter with the Lord: And with their tongs, &amp; in theyr hartes, dissembled euery worde. The forthe parte. 37For why? their harts were nothing b?t, to him nor to his trade: Nor yet to kepe or to performe, the couenaunt that was made, 38Yet was he still so mercifull, when they deserued to dye: That he forgaue them their misdedes, and would not them destroy, Yea many a tyme he turned his wrath, and did himselfe auise: And would not suffer all hys whole, displeasure to aryse. 39Considering they were but fleshe, and euen as a wynde: That passeth away and cannot well, retourne by his owne kynde. 40How often times in wildernes, did they their Lorde prouoke: How did they moue and stir theyr Lorde to plage them with hys stroke? 41Yet did they turne agayne to sinne, and tempted God eftsone: Prescribing to the holy Lorde, what thinges they would haue don, 42Not thinking of his hand and power, nor of the day when he: Deliuered them out of the bondes, of the fierse ennemie. 43Nor howe he wrought his miracles, as they them selues beheld: In Egipt, and the wonder that he did in Zoan field. 44Nor how he turned by his power, theyr waters into bloud That no man might receyue his drink, at riuer nor at floud. 45Nor how he sent them swarmes of flies whiche did them sore annoy And fild theyr countreys full of frogs, whiche should theyr lande destroy. 46Nor how he did commit theyr fruites vnto the Caterpiller. And all the labour of theyr handes, he gaue to the Grashopper. 47With haylestones he destroid their vines so that they were all lost: And not so much as wylde figge trees, but he consumde with frost. 48And yet with hailestones once agayne, the Lorde their cattell smote: And all their flocks and heards like wise with thunderbolts full hote. 49He cast vpon them in his ire, and in his fury strong: Displeasure, wrath, and euill spirites, to trouble them amonge. 50Then to his wrath he made a waye, and spared not the least: But gaue vnto the pestilence, the man and eke the beast. 51He strake also the first borne all, that vp in Egipt came: And all the chief of men and beastes, within the tents of Ham. 52But as for all his owne dearefolk, he did preserue and kepe: And caried them through wildernes, euen lyke a flocke of shepe. 53Without all feare, both safe and sound, he brought them out of thrall: Where as theyr foes with rage of Sea were ouerwhelmed all. 54And brought them out into the costes, of his owne holy land: Euen to the mount whiche he had got, by his strong arme and hand. 55And there cast out the Heathen folke, and did theyr land deuyde: And in the tentes he set their tribes, of Israell to abide. 56Yet for all this, theyr God most hygh, they stirred and tempted styll: And woulde not kepe his testament, nor yet obey his will. 57But as theyr fathers turned backe, euen so they went astray: Muche lyke a bowe that would not b?d, but slipt and start away. The .vi. parte. 58And greued him with their hil altars, with offerings, and with fire: And with theyr Idols vehemently, prouoked him to ire. 59Therwith his wrath began agayne, to kindle in his brest: The naughtines of Israell, he did so muche detest. 60Then he forsoke the tabernacle, of Silo where he was: Right conuersant with earthly men, euen as his dwelling place. 61Then suffred he his might and power, in bondage for to stand: And gaue the honor of his Arcke into his enemies hand. 62And did commit them to the sword, wroth with his heritage: 63The yong men were deuoured with fire maids had no mariage, 64And with the sworde, the priestes also, did pearish euerychone: And not a widow left alyue, theyr deathe for to be mone, 65And then the Lorde began to wake, lyke one that slept a tyme: Or lyke a valyant man of warre, refreshed after wyne. 66With Emerods in the hinder partes, he strake his enemies all: And put them then vnto a shame, that was perpetuall. 67Then he the tent and tabernacle, of Ioseph did refuse: As for the tribe of Ephraim, he would in no wise chuse. 68But chose the tribe of Iehuda, where as they thought to dwell: Euen the noble mount Sion, whiche he did loue so well. 69Where as he did his temple build, both sumptuously and sure: Like as the earth which he hath made for euer to endure. 70Then chose he Dauid, him to serue, his people for to kepe: Which he toke vp and brought away, euen from the foldes of shepe. 71As he did folow the ewes with yong, the Lorde did him auaunce: To fede hys people of Israell, and his inheritaunce. 72Then Dauid with a faithfull hart, his flocke and charge did fede: And prudently with all his power, did gouerne them in dede. Deus venerunt gentes. Psalm. lxxix. I.H. The Israelites complayne to God for the greate calamitie, and oppression that they suffered when Antiochus destroyed theyr temple, and citie Ierusalem, desiring God aide against his ragyng tyrannye, lest Gods name and religion shoulde be contemned amonge the Heathen, whyche should see them thus forsaken and pearyshe. Sing this as the .lxxvii. psalme. [1] O Lorde the Gentils doo inuade, Thyne herytage to spoyle: Ierusalem an heape is made, thy temple they defoyle. 2The bodies of thy sainctes most dere, abrode to birdes they cast: The fleshe of them that doo thee feare, the beastes deuoure and wast. 3Their bloud throughout Ierusalem, as water spilt they haue: So that there is not one of them, to lay theyr dead in graue. 4Thus are we made a laughing stocke, almost the world throughout: The enemies at vs iest and mock, whiche dwell our coastes about. 5Wilt thou (O Lord) thus in thine ire, against vs euer fume? And shew thy wrath as hoate as fyre, thy folke for to consume? Upon those people powre the same, whiche did thee neuer know: All realmes whiche call not on thy name consume and ouerthrow. 7For they haue got the vpper hand, and Iacobs sede destroyd: His habytacion and hys land, they haue left wast and voyd. 8Beare not in minde our former faultes, with spede some pitie shewe: And ayde vs Lorde, in all assaults, for we are weake and low. 9O God that geuest all health and grace, on vs declare the same: Mey not our works, oure sinnes deface for honor of thy name. 10Why shall the wicked still alwaye, to vs as people domme: In thy reproche reioyse and say, where is theyr God become: Require (O Lord) as thou seest good, before our eyes in syght: Of all these folke thy seruauntes bloud, whiche they spilt in despight. 11Receyue into thy syght in hast, the clamours grief and wrong: Of suche as are in prison cast, susteyning yrons strong. Thy force and strength to celebrate, Lorde set them out of bande: Whiche vnto deathe are destinate, and in theyr enemies hand. 12The nations which haue ben so bolde, as to blaspheme thy name: Into their laps with seuen fold, repay agayne the same. 13So we thy folke thy pasture shepe. will prayse thee euermore: And teache all ages for to kepe, for thee lyke prayse in store. Qui regis Israell. Psalme. lxxx. I.H. A lamentable prayer to God to helpe the miseryes of the Churche, desiring him to consider theyr firste estate, when his fauoure shined towardes them, to the entent that he might finish that worke that he had begon. Sing this as the .lxvii. [1] Thou hearde that Israell dost kepe, geue eare and take good hede: Which leadest Ioseph lyke a sheepe, and doest him watche and feede. 2Thou Lorde I say whose seate is set. on cherubins so bryght: shew forth thy selfe and do not let, send downe thy beames of lyght. 3Before Ephraim, and Beniamin, Manasses eke lykewyse: To shew thy power doo thou begin, come healpe vs Lorde aryse. 4Direct our harts vnto thy grace, conuert vs Lorde to thee. Shew vs the brightnes of thy face, and then full safe are wee. 5Lorde God of hostes of Israell, How long wilt thou I saye. Agaynst thy folke in anger swell, and wilt not heare them pray. 6Thou dost them fede with sorrowes depe their breade with teares they eate: And drinke the teares that they do wepe in measure full and greate. 7Thou hast vs made, a very stryfe, to those that dwell aboute: And that our foes do loue of lyfe, they laugh and iest it oute. 8O take vs Lorde vnto thy grace, conuert our mindes to thee: Shew forth to vs thy ioyfull face, and we full safe shalbe. 9From Egipt where it grew not well, thou broughtest a vine full deare: The Heathen folke thou diddest expell, and then diddest plant it here. 10Thou diddest prepare for it a place, and set her rootes full fast: That it did growe and sprynge a pace, and fill the land at last. 11The hilles were couered rounde about with shade that from it came: And eke the Ceders high, and stoute, with braunches of the same. 12Why then diddest thou her wal destroy her hedg pluckt vp thou hast: That all the folke that pas therby, thy vine may spoyle and waste: 13The bore out of the wodes so wilde, doeth digge and rote it oute: The furious beastes out of the field, deuoure it all aboute, 14O Lorde, of hostes retourne agayne, from heauen loke betime: Beholde and with thy healpe sustayne, this poore vineyard of thyne. 15Thy Plant I say, thyne Israell, whom thy right hand hath set: The sonne whiche thou didst loue so wel, O Lorde doo not forget. 16They loppe and cut it downe apace, they burne it eke with fyre: And through the frowning of thy face, we perish in thine ire. 17Let thy right hand be with them nowe, whom thou hast kept so longe: And with the sonne of man whom thou, to thee hast made so stronge. 18And so when thou hast set vs free, and saued vs from shame: Then will we neuer fall from thee, but call vpon thy name. 19O Lord of hosts through thy good grace conuert vs vnto thee: Beholde vs with a Pleasaunte face, and then full safe are wee. Exultate deo, Psalme. lxxxi. I.H. An exhortation to prayse God bothe in harte and voyce for his benefytes, and to worship him only: God condemneth the ingratitude, and sheweth what greate benefites they haue loste thorowe theyr owne malyce. [1] Be lyghte and glad in God reioyce which is our strength &amp; staie be ioyfull and lyfte vp your voyce, to Iacobs God I say, [2]prepare your instrumentes most mete some ioyfull psalme to synge, stryke vp with harp and lute so swete on euery pleasant stryng. 3Blow as it were in the new mone, with trumpets of the best: As it is vsed to be done, at any solemne feast. 4For this is vnto Israell, a statute and a trade: A lawe that must be kept full well, which Iacobs God hath made. 5This clause with Ioseph was decreed, when he from Egipt came: That as a witnes all his sede, shoulde still obserue the same. 6When God I say, had so preparde, to bryng him from that land: Where as the speach which he had heard, he did not vnderstand. 7I from his shoulders toke saith he, the burden cleane awaye: And from the furnace quit him free, from burnyng bricke of claye, 8When thou in grief, diddest cry and cal I holpe thee by and by: And I did aunswer the withall, in thunder secretly. 9Yea at the waters of discorde, I did thee tempt and proue: Wheras the goodnes of the Lorde, with muttering thou diddest moue, 10Heare O my folke, O Israell, and I assure it thee: Regarde and marke my wordes full wel if thou wilt cleaue to me. 11Thou shalte no God in thee reserue, of any land abrode: Nor in no wise to bow or serue, a straunge and forraine God. 12I am the Lorde, thy God, and I, from Egipt set thee free: Then aske of me aboundauntly, and I will geue it the. 13And yet my people woulde not heare, my voyce when that I spake: Nor Israell would not obey, but did me quite forsake. 14Then did I leaue them to their will, in hardnes of theyr hart To walke in theyr owne counsels still, them selues they might peruert. 15O that my people would haue hard, the wordes that I did say: And eke that Israell would regarde, to walke within my waye. 16How soone would I c?found their foes, and bring them downe full lowe: And tourne my hand vpon all those, that woulde them ouerthrowe. 17And they that at the Lorde doo rage, as slaues shoulde seke him till: But of his folke the time and age, should florish euer still, 18I would haue fed them with the croppe, and finest of the wheate: And make the rock with hony droppe, that they theyr filles should eate. Deus stetit in Sinagoga. Psalm. lxxxii. I.H. The Prophet declaring God to be present amongest the iudges and maiestrates, reproueth their parcialitie and vnrighteousnes, and exhorteth them to doo iustice, but seeyng no amendemente, he desireth God to vndertake the matter, and execute iustice hym selfe. Sing this as the .lxxviii. Ps. [1] Amid the prease with men of might, The Lorde him selfe did stand: To pleade the cause of truth and ryght, with iudges of the land. 2How long (said be) will you procede, false iudgement to awarde? And haue respect for loue of mede, the wicked to regarde? 3Whereas of due ye shoulde defend, the fatherles and weake: And when the poore man doth contend, in iudgement iustly speake. 4If ye be wyse defende the cause, of poore men in theyr ryght: And ryd the nedie from the clawes, of tyrants force and myght. 5But nothyng will they know or learne, in vayne to them I talke: They will not see or ought discerne, but still in darknes walke. For lo, euen now the tyme is come, that all thynges fall to nought: And likewise lawes both all and some, for gayne are sold and bought. 6I had decreed it in my syght, as Gods to take you all: And children to the most of myght, for loue I did you call. 7But not withstanding ye shall dye, as men, and so decay: O tyrannes I shall you destroye, and plucke you quyte away. 8Up Lord &amp; let thy strength be knowne, and iudge the worlde with might: For why? all nations are thyne owne, to take them as thy ryght. Deus quis Similis. Psalme. lxxxiii. I.H.

Sing this as the .lxxvii. Ps. [1] Do not (O God) refrayne thy tounge, in silence, doo not staye: Withholde not Lord thy selfe so long nor make no more delaye. 2For why, beholde thy foes and see. how they doo rage and crye, And those that beare an hate to thee, holde vp theyr heades on hye. 3Against thy folke they vse disceate, and craftly they enquire: For thine elect to lye in wayte, theyr councell doth conspire 4Come on (sayd they) let vs expell, and plucke these folke awaye: So that the name of Israell, may vtterly decay. 5They all conspire within theyr hart, how they may thee withstand: Agaynst the Lorde to take a parte, they are in league and bande. 6The tentes of all the Edomites, the Ismalites also: The Hagarenes and Moabites, with diuers other more. 7Geball with Ammon, and likewise, dothe Amalece conspire: The Phillistines against thee ryse, with them that dwell at Cyre. 8And Assur eke is well apaide, with them in league to be: And doeth become afence and ayde, to Lots posteritie. 9As thou diddest to the Madianites, so serue them Lorde echeone: As to Cicer and to Iabin, beside the broke kison. 10Whom thou in Endor diddest descry, and wast them through thy might, That they like doung on earth did lye, and not in open sighte. 11Make them now &amp; theyr Lords appere, like Zeb and Oreb then: As Zebah and Zalmana weare, the kynges of Madian. 12Whiche said, let vs throughout the land, in all the costes abrode: Posses and take into our hand, the fayer houses of God. 13Tourn them O God with storms as fast as wheeles that haue no staye: Or lyke as chaffe, whiche men doo cast, with windes to flee awaye. 14Lyke as the fire, with rage and fume, the mightye forest spilles: And as the flame doth quyte consume, the mountaynes and the hilles. 15So let the tempest of thy wrath, vpon theyr neckes be layde: And of thy stormy wynde and shower, Lorde make them all afrayed. 16Lorde brynge them all I thee desire, to suche rebuke and shame That it may cause them to enquire, and learne to seke thy name. 17And let them euermore dayly, to shame and sclaunder fall And in rebuke and oblique, to perish eke with all. 18That they may know &amp; fele full well, that thou art called Lord And that alone thou doest excell, and raygne throughout the worlde.

They when they florish in their ill, for euer shalbe wast. 8But thou art mighty Lord most hye, yea thou dost raygne therfore: In euery time eternally, both now &amp; euermore. 9For why (O Lorde) beholde and see, beholde thy foes I say: How all that worke iniquitie, shall perish and decay. 10But thou like as an Unicorne, shall lift my horne on hie: With freshe and new prepard oyle, thine ointed king am I. 11And of my foes before mine eyes, shall see the fall and shame: Of all that vp against me rise, myne eare shall heare the same. 12The iust shall florish vp on hie, as date trees bud and blowe? And as the ceders multiplye, in Lybanus that growe. 13For they are planted in the place, and dwelling of our God: Within his courtes they spring apace, and florish all abrode. 14And in their age more frute shall bryng bothe fat and well besene: And pleasauntly both bud and spryng, with boughes and braunches grene. 15To shew that God is good and iust, and vpright is his will: He is my rocke, my hope, and trust, in him there is none ill.

Shall they reioyce whiche be so stoute, whose works are euer ill? 5Thy flocke (O Lorde) thine heritage, they spoyle and vex full sore: Against thy people they doo rage, still dayly more and more. 6The widdowes whiche are comfortles, and straungers they destroy They slea the children fatherles, and none doth put them by. 7And when they take these things in h?d this talke they haue of thee Can Iacobs God this understand, tush no he can not see. 8O folke vnwise, a people rude, some knowledg now discearne Ye fooles amonge the multitude, at length begin to learn. 9The lord which made the eare of man he needes of right must heare: He made the eyne, all things must then, before his sight appeare. 10The Lorde doth all the world correct, and make men vnderstand: shall he not then your deedes detect, how can ye scape his hand? 11The lord doth know, the thoughts of m? his hart he setteth full playne: The lord I say mens thoughts doth frame, and findeth them but vayne. 12But Lorde that Man is happy sure, whom thou doest kepe in awe: And through correction doest procure, to teache him in thy law. 13Wherby he shall in quyet rest, in time of trouble sitte: When wicked men shalbe supprest, and fall into the pit. 14For sure the Lorde will not refuse, his people for to take: His heritage whom he did chuse, he will no time forsake. 15Untill that iudgement be decrede, to iustice to conuert: That all may follow her with spede, that are of vpright hart. 16But who vpon my part shall stande, against the cursed trayne? Or who shall rid me from their hand, that wicked workes maintayne. 17Except the Lorde had ben myn ayde, mine enmies to repell: My soule and lyfe had now ben layde, almost as low as hell: 18When I did saye my foote doth slide, and now am lyke to fall: Thy goodnes Lorde did so prouide, to stay me vp with all. 19When with my selfe I mused muche, and could no comfort finde: Then Lorde thy goodnes did me touch and that did ease my minde. 20Wilt thou enhaunte thy selfe and draw with wicked men to sit: Which with pretence in stede of lawe, muche mischief doo commit. 21For they consoult against the lyfe, of righteous men and good. And in theyr councells they are ryfe, to sheade the giltles bloud. 22But yet the Lorde he is to me, a strong defence or locke: He is my God to him I flee, he is my strength and rock. And he shall cause their mischefe all, them sealues for to annoye: And in their malice they shall fall, our God shall them destroye. Venite exultemus. Psalme .lxxxxv. I.H. An earnest exhortaci? to prayse god for the gouernment of the world and the election of his church. An admonishion not to folow the rebellion of the olde fathers, that tempted God in the wildernes: For the which they might not enter into the land of promise. [1] O come let vs lyfte vp oure voyce, and synge vnto the Lorde, in him our rock of health reioyce, let vs with one accorde, [2]yea let vs come before his face, to geue him thanks and prayse, in singing Psalmes vnto his grace, let vs be glad all wayes. 3For why the Lorde he is no doubte, a greate and myghty God: A kynge aboue all Gods throughout, in all the worlde abrode. 4The secretes of the yearth so depe, and corners of the land: The toppes of hilles that are so stepe, he hath them in his hand. 5The sea and waters all are his, for he the same hath wrought: The earth and all that therin is, his hande hath made of nought. 6Come let vs bow and prayse the Lorde, before him let vs fall: And knele to him with one acorde, the whiche hathe made vs all. 7For why he is the Lorde our God, for vs he doth prouide? We are his folke he doth vs fede, his shepe, and he our guide. 8To day if ye his voice will heare, then harden not your hart: As ye with grudging many a yeare, prouoked me in deserte. 9Wher as your fathers tempted me, my power for to proue: My wondrous works wh? they did see, yet still they woulde me moue. 10Twise twenty yeare, they did me greue and I to them did saye: They erre in heart and not beleue, they haue not knowne my waye. 11Wherfore I sware, when that my wrath was kindled in my brest: That they should neuer treade the pathe, to enter to my rest. Cantate domino. Psalme. lxxxxvi. I.H. An exhortacyon bothe to the Iewes and gentiles to prayse God for hys mercye. And this specyallye ought to be referred to the kingdom of Chryste.

Sing this as the .lxxxxv. p. [1] The Lord doeth raygne, although at it, The people rage full fore: Yea he on Cherubin doth sit, though all the world woulde rore. 2The Lorde that doth in Sion dwell, is high and wonders great: Aboue all folke he doth excell, and he aloft is set. 3Let all men prayse thy mightye name, for it is fearfull sure: And let them magnifye the same, that holy is and pure. 4The princely power of our king, doth loue iudgement and ryght: Thou rightly rulest euery thing, in Iacob through thy might. 5To prayse the Lorde our God deuise, all honour to him doo: His fote stole worship ye likewise, for he is holy too. 6Moses, Aron, and Samuell, as priestes on him did call: When they did pray he herd them well and gaue them aunswer all. 7Within the cloude to them he spake, then did they labour still: To keepe suche lawes as he did make, and pointed them vntill. 8O Lord, our god thou diddest them here and aunswerst them againe: Thy mercy did on them appere. theyr deedes diddest not maintayne. 9O laude and prayse our God and Lord, within this holy hill: For why our God throughoute the world is holy euer styll.

I mercye will and iudgement sing, O Lorde God vnto thee: And wisely doo in perfect way. vntill thou come to me. And in the middest of my house walke, in purenes of my sprite: And I no kind of wicked thing, will set before my sight. I hate their worke that fall away, it shall not cleaue to me, From me shall part the froward hart: none euell will I see. Him will I stroy that sclaundereth, his neyghbour priuely: The lofty hart I can not beare, nor him that loketh hie. Mine eyes shall be on them within, the land that faithfull be: In perfect way who worketh, shall be seruant vnto me: I will no guilefull person haue, within my house to dwell: And in my presence he shal not, remaine that lies doth tell: Betymes I will destroy euen all, the wicked of the lande: That I may from Gods citie cut, the wicked workers band. Domine exaudi orationem. Psalm. C.ii. I.H. It semeth that this prayer was apointed to the faithful to pray in the captiuitie of Babilon. A consolation for the buyldyng of the churche: wherof foloweth the prayse of god to be published vnto al posterities: The conuersion of the Gentels: And the stabilytie of the churche. Sing this as the. lxvii. [The first parte.] O heare my prayer, Lorde, and let, my crye come vnto thee: In tyme of troble doo not hide, thy face away from me. Inclyne thyne eares to me, make haste, to heare me when I call: For as the smoke doth fade, so doo my dayes consume and fall. And as a herth, my bones are burnt: my hart is smitten dead, And withers as the grasse, that I forget to eate my bread. By reason of my groning voyce, my bones cleaue to my skinne: As pellicane of wildernes, suche case now am I in. And as an oule in desert is, loe I am suche a one: I watch, and as a sparow on the house top am alone. Loe dayly in reprochefull wise, mine enmies doo me scorne. And they that doo against me rage, against me they haue sworne. Surely with ashes, as with breade, my hunger I haue filld, And mingled haue my drink with teares that fro mine eyes haue stild, Because of thy displeasure, Lord, thy wrath and thy disdayne: For thou hast lifted me aloft, and cast me downe agayne. The dayes wherin I pas my lyfe, are like the fleting shade: And I am withered like the gras, that sone away doth fade. But thou, O Lord, for euer doest remaine in stedy place, And thy remembrance euer doth abide from race to race. The second parte. Thou wilt aryse, and mercy thou, to Sion wilt extend: The time of mercy, now the time foreset is come to end. For euen in the stones therof, thy seruants do delighte, And on the dust therof they haue, compassion in theyr sprite. Then shall the Heathen peoples feare, the Lordes most holy name: And all the kinges on earth shall drede thy glory and thy fame: Then when the Lord the mighty God, againe shall Syon rere, And then when he most nobly in, his glory shall appeare: To prayer of the desolate, when he himself shall bend: When he shall not disdayne vnto, theyr prayer to attend. This shalbe written for the age, that after shall succede: the people yet vncreated. the Lordes renome shall sprede. For he from his hie sanctuarye, hath loked downe belowe, and out of Heauen hath the Lord, beheld the earth also: That of the mourning captiue he, might heare the woefull crye, And that he might deliuer those, that damned are to dye: That they in Sion may declare, the Lordes most holy name, and in Ierusalem set fourth, the prayses of the same: Then when the people of the land, and kingdomes with accorde, Shalbe assembled for to do: theyr seruice to the Lorde. The third parte. My former force of strength he hath. abated in the way, And shorter he did cut my dayes: thus I therfore did say: My God, in middes of all my dayes, now take me not away: Thy yeres endure eternally from age to age for ay. Thou the foundations of the earth, before all time hast layde, And Lorde the heauens are the work, which thine owne hands haue made. Yea they shall perish and decay, but thou shalt tary still: And they shall all in tyme waxe olde, euen as a garment will. Thou as a garment shalt then chaunge, and changed shall they be: But thou doest still abide the same, thy yeares doo neuer flee. The children of thy seruantes shall, continually endure, And in thy sight their happy sede for euer shall stand sure. Benedic anima mea. 1. Psalm. Ciii. T.S. This is a Psalme most excellent, wherin the Prophet doth prouoke men and angels, and all creatures to prayse the Lorde for his fatherly mercyes, and deliuerance of his people from all euils for his prouidence ouer all thinges and the preseruation of the faithfull. [The first parte.] [1] My soule geue laud vnto the lord my sprite shall doo the same: and all the secrets of my hart praise ye his holy name, [2]Geue thanks to god for all his gifts, shew not thy self vnkind &amp; suffer not his benefites to slip out of thy mind. 3That gaue thee pardon for thy faults, and thee restored agayne: For all thy weake and frayle disease, and healde thee of thy payne, 4That did redeme thy life from death, from whiche thou couldest not flee: His mercy and compassion bothe, he did extend to thee. 5That filled with goodnes thy desyre, and did prolong thy youth: Like as the Egle casteth her bill, wherby her age renueth. 6The Lorde with iustice doth repaye, all suche as be opprest: So that their suffrings &amp; their wrongs, are turned to the best. 7his wayes and his commaundements to Moyses he did shew: His counsels and his valiant actes, the Israelites did know. 8The Lorde is kinde and mercyfull, when sinners doo him greue: The slowest to conceyue a wrath, and rediest to forgeue. 9He chideth not vs contiuually, though we be full of stryfe: Nor kepeth our faultes in memory, for all our sinfull lyfe. 10Nor yet according to our sinnes, the Lorde doth vs regarde, Nor after our iniquities, he doth not vs rewarde. 11But as the space is wondrous great, twixt heauen and earth aboue: So is his goodnes muche more large, to them that do him loue. 12God doth remoue our sinnes from vs, and our offences all: As farre as is the sunne rising, full distant from his fall. The second part. 13And loke what pitte parents deare, vnto their children beare: Like pitie beareth the Lorde to suche, as worship him in feare. 14The lord y? made vs knoweth our shape, our mould and fashion iust: Howe weake and frayle our nature is, and how we be but dust. 15And how the tyme of mortall men, is lyke the withering hay: Or like the floure right fayre in field, that fadth full sone away. 16Whose glosse &amp; beautie stormy windes, doo vtterly disgrace: And make that after theyr assaults, suche blossomes haue no place. 17But yet the goodnes of the Lorde, with his shall euer stand: Theyr childrens children do receyue, his righteousnes at hand. 18I meane which kepe his couenant, with all theyr whole desire. And not forget to doo the thing, that he doth them require. 19The heauens hie are made the seate, and fotestole of the Lorde: And by his power imperiall, he gouerneth all the world. 20Ye angels whiche are great in power, prayse ye and bles the Lorde: Which to obey and doo his wyll, immediatly accorde. 21Ye noble hostes and ministers, cease not to laude hym styll: Which ready are to execute, hys pleasure and his wyll. 22Ye all his workes in euery place, prayse ye his holy name: My hart my mynde, and eke my soule, prayse ye also the same. Benedic anima mea. Psalm. Ciiii. W.K. An excellent psalme to prayse God for the creation of the worlde, and the gouernance of the same by his maruelous prouidence: where in the Prophet prayeth againste the wicked, who are occasions that God diminisheth his blessings. [The first parte.] [1] My soule praise the lord: speake good of his name. O lord our great god, how dost thou appeare, [2]So passing in glory that great is thy fame: honour and maiestie in thee shine most cleare. with light as a robe, thou hast thee be clad wherby all the earth thy greatnes may see, the heauens in such sort thou also hast spread, that it to a curtaine compared may be. 3His chamber beames lye, in the cloudes full sure, Which as his charet, are made him to beare: And there with much swiftnes his course doth indure, Upon the winges riding of winde in the ayre. He maketh his sprites: as herauldes to go: And lightnings to serue we see also prest: His will to accomplish they runne to and fro, To saue, or consume thinges, as semeth him best. 5He groundeth the earth, so firmely and fast, That it once to moue none haue shall suche power 6The depe afaire couering for it made thou hast, Which by his owne nature the hilles wolde deuoure, 7But at thy rebuke the waters doo flee, And so geue due place, thy worde to obaye: At thy voyce of thunder so fearfull they be, That in theyr great raging, they hast sone away. The mountaynes full hygh they then vp ascend: If thou doo but speake, So likewise the valleis moste quickely descend, Where thou them appointest, remayne they doo still.) 9Their bondes hast thou set how farre they shall runne, So as in their rage not that pas they can: For God hathe appointed, they shall not returne The earth to destroy more, whiche made was for man. 10He sendeth the springs to strong streames or lakes, Which runne doo full swyft amonge the huge hilles, 11Where both the wilde asses, their thirst oft times slakes, And beastes of the mountaynes therof drink their filles, 12By these pleasant springs or fountaynes full fayre. The soules of the ayre abide shall and dwell: Who moued by nature to hoppe here and there, Among the grene branches their songs shall excell, 13The mountaines to moist, the cloudes he doth vse: The earth with his workes are wholy repleat: 14So as the brute cattell he dooeth not refuse, But grasse doth prouyde them, and herbe for mans meate. 15Yea breade, wine and oyle, he made for mans sake, His face to refresh, and hart to make strong, 16The ceders of Liban this greate Lorde dyd make, Whiche trees he doeth nourish, that grow vp so long. 17In these may birdes buylde, and make there theyr nest: In firre trees the storckes remayne and abyde: 18The hie hilles are succours, for wilde goates to rest, And eke the rocks stonye for conyes to hyde. 19The moone then is set her seasons to runne, The dayes from the nightes therby to discearne: And by thee descending also of the sunne, The colde from heate alway therby we do learne. 20When darkenes doth come by Gods will and power, Then crepe forth doo all the beastes of the wood: 21The lions range roaring their pray to deuoure. But yet it is thou Lord, which giuest them foode. 22Assone as the sunne is vp they retyre. To couche in theyr dennes then are they full fayne, 23That man doo his worke may: as right doth require: Till night come and call him, to take rest agayne. The thirde parte. 24How sondry, O Lorde, are all thy workes founde. With wisdom full great, they are in dede wrought: So that the whole worlde of thy prayse doth sounde, And as for thy ryches, they passe all mens thought: 25So is the great sea, which large is and broade, Where thinges that crepe, swarme, and beastes of eche sorte: 26There both mightie shippes saile, and some lye at roade: The whale huge and monstrous there also doth sporte. 27All thinges on thee wayte: thou doest them relieue, And thou in due tyme full well doest them fede. 28Now when it doth please thee, the same so to geue, They gather full gladly those thinges which they nede, Thou openest thyne hand, and they finde suche grace, That they with good thinges are filled we see: 29But sore are they troubled, if thou turne thy face. For if thou their breath take, vile dust then they be. 30Againe when thy sprite from thee doth procede, All things to appoint, and what shall insue, Then are they created, as thou hast decreed, And doest by thy goodnes the drye earth renew. 31The prayse of the Lorde, for euer shall last, Who may in his workes, by right well reioyce. 32His loke can the earth make, to tremble full fast, And likewise the mountains to smoke at his voyce. 33To thys Lorde and God sing will I alwayes: So longe as I liue, my God prayse wyll I 34Then am I most certayne my wordes shall him please: I will reioyce in him, to him will I cry. 35The sinners, O Lorde, consume in thine ire, And eke the peruerse them roote out with shame: But as for my soule, now let it still desire. And say with the faithful, prayse ye the Lordes Name. Confitemini domino. Psalm. Cv. N. He prayseth the singuler goodnes of God who hathe of all the people of the worlde chosen a peculier people to him selfe, and hauyng chosen them, neuer ceaseth to doo them good, euen for his promes sake. Sing this as the. lxxxxv. [The first parte.] Geue prayses vnto God the Lorde, and call vpon his name: Among the people eke declare, his workes, to spred his fame. Sing ye vnto the Lorde, I say, and sing vnto him prayse, And talke of all the wondrous workes, that he hath wrought alwayes. In honor of his holy name, reioyse with one accorde, And let the hart also reioyse of them that seke the Lorde. Seke ye the Lord, and seke the strength of his eternall might, And seke his face continually, And presence of his sight. The wondrous works that he hath don, kepe still in mindfull hart, Ne let the iugements of his mouth, out of your minde depart, Ye that of faithfull Abraham, his seruant are the sede, Ye his elect, the children that of Iacob doo procede: For he, he only is I say, the myghty Lord our God, And his most rightfull iugements are through all the earth abrode. His promise and his couenant, whiche he hath made to his He hath remembred euermore, to thousandes of degrees. The .ii. parte. The couenant which he hath made, with Abraham long agoe, And faithfull othe which he hath sworne to Isaac also, And did confirme the same for law, that Iacob should obey: And for eternall couenant to Israell for ay, When thus he said, loe I to you, all Canaan land will geue, The lot of your inheritance wherin your sede shall lyue, Although their number at that tyme, did very small appeare, Yea very small, and in the land they then but strangers were. Whyle yet they walkt from land to lande, without a sure abode, And while fro sondry kingdomes they did wander all abrode, And wrong at none oppressers hand, he suffred them to take, But euen the great and mighty kinges, reproued for their sake. And thus he sayd, touche ye not those, that mine anoynted be, Ne doo the prophets any harme, that doo pertayne to me. He calld a dearth vpon the land, of death he stroyed the store: But he against their time of nede, had sent a man before. The third parte. Euen Ioseph which had once ben solde to liue a slaue in woe: Whose feete they hurt in stocks, whose soule, the iron pearst also. Untill the tyme came when his cause, was knowne apparantly, The mighty word of God the Lord, his faultles truth did trye. The king sent and deliuerd him, from prison where he was: The ruler of the people then, did freely let hym pas: And ouer all hys house he made, him Lorde to beare the swey, and of his substance made him haue, the rule and all the stay, That he might to his will instruct the princes of his land, And wisdomes lore his auncyent men, might teache to vnderstand. Then into the Egiptian land, came Israell also: And Iacob in the land of Ham, did liue a straunger thoo. His people he excedingly, in number made to flowe: And ouer all their enemies, in strength he made them growe. Whose hart he turnd, that they with hate his people did entreate: And did his seruantes wrongfully, Abuse with false deceite. His faithfull seruant Moses then, and Aaron whom he chose, He did commaund to goe to them, his message to disclose. The wondrous message of his signes, among them they did shewe: And wonders in the land of Ham, then did they worke also. Darknes he sent, and made it darke, in dede of brighter day, And vnto his commission they did not disobey. He turnd theyr waters into bloud, he did their fishes slay: Their land brought frogs, eu? in y? place where their king Pharao lay. He spake and at his voyce there came, great swarmes of noysome flyes, And all the quarters of theyr land, were filld with crauling lyse. He gaue them colde and stony hayle, in stede of milder rayne: And firy flames within theyr land, he sent vnto theyr payne. He smote their vines, and al theyr frees wheron their figges did growe, And all the trees within their coastes, downe did he ouerthrowe, He spake: then caterpillers did, and greshoppers abound, Which eate the grasse in all their land and frute of all their ground. The .v. parte. The first begotten in their land, eke deadly did he smite, Yea the beginning and first frute, of all theyr strength and might, With gold and siluer he them brought, from Egipt land to passe, And in the number of their tribes, no feble one there was. Egipt was glad and ioyfull then, when they did thense depart: For terrour and the feare of them, was fallen vpon theyr hart. To shroude them fr? the parching heat a cloude he did display: And fire he sent to geue them lyght, when night had hid the day. They asked and he caused quayles, to rayne at their request, And fully with the bread of heauen, their hunger he represt. He opend then the stony rock, and waters gushed out, And in the drye and parched groundes lyke riuers ranne about. For of his holy couenant, ay myndefull was he thoe: Which to his seruant Abraham, he plighted long agoe. He brought his people forth with mirth and his elect with ioy: Out of the cruell land where they, had lyued in great anoye. And of the heathen men he gaue, to them the frutefull landes, The labors of the people eke they toke into theyr hands. That they his holy statutes might, obserue for euermore And faithfully obey his lawes, prayse ye the Lorde therfore. Confitemine domino. Psal. Cvi. N. The people dispersed vnder Antiochus doo magnifie the goodnes of God emonge the iust and repentant: Desiring to be brought agayne into the lande by Gods mercyfull vysytacion. And after the manifold meruayles of God wrought in their deliueraunce forth of Egipt and the great ingratitude of the people rehearsed, they doo praye and dedesier to be gathered from among the Heath? to the entent they may prayse the name of the God of Israell. Sing this as the .lxxxxv. [The first parte.] Prayse ye the Lod, for he is good, his mercye dures for ay: Who can expresse his noble actes, or all his prayse display. They blessed are that iugment kepe, and iustly doo alwaye: With fauour of thy people, Lorde, remember me I pray, And with thy sauing health O Lorde, vouchesafe to visite me: That I the great felicytie, of thine elect may see. And with thy peoples ioy I may, a ioyfull minde posses: And may with thine inheritance, a glorying hart expres. Bothe we and eke our fathers all, haue sinned euery one: We haue committed wickednes, and leudly we haue done, The wonders great which thou O lord hast done in Egipt land: Our fathers, though they saw them al, yet did not vnderstand. Nor they thy mercies multitude, did kepe in thankfull mind? But at the sea yea the red sea, rebelled most vnkind. Neuertheles he saued them, for honor of hys name, That he might make his power knowne and spred abrode with fame. The red sea he did then rebuke, and forthwith it was dryed: And as in wildernes, so through, the depe he did them guide He saued them from the cruel hand, of their despitefull foe And from the enmies hand he did, deliuer them also. The second parte. The waters their oppressors whelmd, not one was left alyue, Then they beleued his wordes, &amp; praise in song they did him geue. But by and by vnthankefully, his workes they cleane forgat: And for his counsell and his will, they did neglect to wayte. But lusted in the wildernes, with fond and gredy lust, And in the desert tempted God, the stay of all theyr trust, And then theyr wanton mindes desire he suffred them to haue, but wasting leannes therwithall into their soule he gaue, Then, when they lodged in the tentes, at Moses they did grutch, Aaron the holy of the Lorde, so did they enuie muche. Therfore the earth did open wide, and Dathan did deuoure: And all Abrams companye, did couer in that houre. In their assemblie kindled was, the whote consuming fyre, And wasting flame did then burne vp, the wicked in his ire. Upon the hill of Horeb they an idole calf did frame, And there the molten image they did worship of the same. Into the likenes of a calfe, that fedeth on the grasse: Thus they their glory turnd and all, their honor did deface. And God their only sauiour, vnkindly they forgot, Which many great and mighty things in Egip land hadt wrought, The third parte. And in the land of Ham for them. most wondrous works had done And by the red sea dredfull things performed long agone. Therfore for their so shewing them, forgetfull and vnkind, To bring destruction on them all he purposde in his minde. Had not his chosen Moses stoode, before them in the breake: To turne his wrath, lest he on them, with slaughter should him wreke. They did despise the pleasant land, that he beheght to geue: Yea and the workes that he had spoke, they did no whit beleue: But in their tents with grudging hart, they wickedly repined, Nor to the voyce of God the Lorde, they gaue a harkning mynde, Therfore against them lifted he, his strong reuenging hand, Them to destroy in wildernes, ere they should see the land. And to destroy theyr sede among the nations with his rod, And through the contrees of the world to scatter them abrode. To Baal Peor then they did, adioyne themselues also, And eate the offringes of the dead so they forsoke him tho. Thus with theyr owne inuentions, his wrath they did prouoke, And in his so inkindled wrath, the plage vpon them broke. But Phineas stoode vp with zeale, the sinners vile to slay, And iudgement he did execute, and then the plage did stay, The .iiii. parte. It was imputed vnto him, for righteousnes that day, And from thenceforth so compted is from race to race for aye. At waters eke of Meribah, they did him angry make, Yea so far fourth that Moses was then punisht for theyr sake, Because they vext his sprite so sore, that in impatient heate His lippes spake vnaduisedly, his feruor was so greate. Nor as the Lorde commaunded them, they slew the people thoe, But were among the heathen mixt, and learnde their workes also, And did their idoles serue, whiche were their ruine and decay, To feends their sonnes &amp; daughters they did offer vp and slay. Yea with vnkindly murdring knife, the giltles bloud they spilt, Yea theyr owne sons &amp; daughters bloud without all cause of gilt, Whom they to Canaan idoles then, offerd with wicked hand, And so with blood of innocents, defyled was the land. Thus wer they stayned with the works of their owne filthy way, And with their owne inuentions, a whoring did they stray. Therfore against his people was the Lordes wrath kindled sore, And euen his owne inheritance therfore he did abhorre. Into the handes of heathen men, he gaue them for a prey: And made theyr foes the lords wh? they were forced to obey. The .v. parte. Yea and their hatefull enemies, opprest them in the land: And they were humbly made to stoope as subiectes to theyr hand. Full oftentimes from thrall had he, deliuerd them before, But with their counsels they to wrath prouoked him euermore. Therfore they by their wickednes, were brought full low to lye. Yet when he saw them in distres, he harkned to theyr crye. He calld to mind his couenant, which he to them had swore. And by his mercies multitude, repented him therfore. And fauour he them made to finde, before the sight of those: That led them captiue from their land, when erst they were their foes. Saue vs, O Lorde that art our God, saue vs O Lord we pray, And from among the Heathen folke, Lorde, gather vs away. That we may spred the noble prayse, of thy most holy name, That we may glory in thy prayse and sounding of thy fame. The Lorde the God of Israell, be blest for euermore. Let all the people say Amen. prayse ye the Lord therfore. Confitemini domino. Psalme. Cvii. VV.K. The Prophet exhorteth all those that are redemed by the Lord and gathered vnto hym, to geue thankes for this mercyfull prouidence of God, gouerning all thynges at his good pleasure, sending good and euill, prosperitie and aduersitie, to bryng men vnto him. Therfore as the righteous thereat reioyce, so shall the wicked haue their mouthes stopped. Sing this as the .cxix. Psal. [The first parte.] [1] Geue thankes vnto the Lorde our God, for gratious is he: And that his mercy hath none ende, all mortall men may se. 2Suche as the Lorde redemed hathe, with thanks should prayse his name And shew how they from foes wer fred, and yow he wrought the same, 3He gathered them forth of the landes, that lay so farre about: From East to west, from north to south his hand did finde them out. 4They wandred in the wildernes, and strayed from the way, And founde no citie where to dwell, that serue might for theyr stay. 5Whose thirst and honger was so great in these desertes so voyde: That faintnes did them sore assalt, and eke their soules anoyde. 6Then did they crye in their distres, vnto the Lorde for ayde, Who did remoue their troublous state, according as they prayde. 7And by that way which was most right he led them like a guide: That they might to a citie go, and there also abide, 8Let men therfore before the Lorde, confes his goodnes then: And shew the wonders, that he doth, before the sonnes of men. 9For he the emptie soule sustaynde, whom thirst had made to faynte: The hungrie soule with goodnes fed, and did them eke acquainte: 10Suche as doo dwell in darkenes depe where they of death do wayte, Fast bound to tast such troublous storms as yron chains doo threate: The second parte. 11For that against the lords owne words they sought so to rebell. Esteming light his counsels high, which doo so farre excell. 12But when he humbled them full lowe, they then fell downe with grief, And none was found, so muche to helpe wherby to get relief. 13Then did they crye in their distres, vnto the Lorde for ayde: Who did remoue their troublous state, according as they prayde. 14For he from darknes out them brought and from deaths dredfull shade, Bursting with force the yron bandes, which did before them lade. 15Let men therfore before the Lord, confes his kindnes then: And shew the wonders that he doth, before the sonnes of men. 16For he threw downe their gates of bras and brake them with strong hand The yron barres he smote in two: nothing could him withstand. 17The foolish folke great plagues do fele and cannot from them wend: But hepe on mo to those they haue, because they doo offend. 18Their soule so much did lothe all meat that none they coulde abyde: Wherby death had them almost caught, as they full truly tryde. 19Then did they crye in theyr distres, vnto the Lorde for ayde: Who did remoue their troublous state, according as they prayde. 20For he then sent to them his worde, whiche health did sone restore, And brought them fr? those dangers depe wherin they were before. The thyrde parte. 21Let men therfore before the Lorde, confes his kindnes then, And shew the wonders that he doeth, before the sonnes of men. 22And let them offer sacrifice, with thankes and also feare, And speake of all his wondrous works with glad and ioyfull cheare. 23Suche as in shippes or brittell barkes, into the seas descend, Their marchandise through fearful flods to compas and to ende. 24Those men are forced to beholde, the Lordes workes, what they be: And in the dangerous depe the same, most maruellous they see. 25For at his worde, the stormie winde, ariseth in a rage: And stirreth vp the surges so, as nought can them asswage. 26Then are they lifted vp so hygh. the clouds they seme to gayne: And plunging downe the depth vntill, theyr soules consume with payne. 27And like a drunkard, to and fro, now here now there they reele: As men with feare of wit bereft, or had of sense no feele. 28Then did they cry in theyr distresse, vnto the Lorde for ayde: Who did remoue their troublous state according as they prayde. 29For with his word the Lord doth make the sturdie storme to cease: So that the gret waues fr? their rage, are brought to rest and peace. 30Then are men glad when rest is come which they so muche doo craue, And are by him in hauen brought, which they so fayne woulde haue. The forth parte. 31Let men therfore before the Lorde, confes his kindenes then: And shew the wonders that he doth before the sonnes of men, 32Let them in presence of the folke, with prayse extoll his name: And where the elders doo conuent, let them there doo the same. 33For running floods to dry desertes, he doeth oft change and turne: And dryeth vp, as it were dust, the springing well and burne. 34A frutefull land with pleasures deckt, full barren doeth he make. When on their sinnes, which dwell therin he doeth iust vengeance take. 35Againe the wildernes full rude, he maketh frute to beare: With pleasant springs of water cleare though none before were there. 36Wherin suche hungrye soules are set, as he doeth freely chuse, That they a citie may them buylde to dwell in for theyr vse. 37That they may sow theyr pleasant l?d and vineyardes also plant: To yelde them frutes of suche increase, as none may seme to want. 38They multiplye exceadingly: the Lord doeth bles them so: Who doeth also their brut beastes make by numbers great to growe. 39But wh? the faithfull are low brought by the oppressors stoute: And minish do through many plagues, that compas them about, 40Then doeth he princes bring to shame, which did them so oppres, And likewise caused them to erre, within the wildernes. 41But yet the poore he rayseth vp, out of his troubles depe: And oft times doeth his trayne augm?t muche like a flocke of shepe. 42The righteous shall beholde this sight, and also muche reioyce: Whereas the wicked and peruerse, with grief shall stop theyr voyce. 43But who is wise that now full well, he may these thinges recorde? For certeinly suche shall perceyue, the kindnes of the Lorde. Paratum cor meum. Psalme. Cviii. N. This psalme is composed of two other psalmes before, the seuen and fyftye and the sixtie. The matter here conteyned is, That Dauid geueth him selfe with harte and voyce to prayse the Lorde, and assureth him selfe of the promes of God concerning his kingdome ouer Ifraell, and his power against other nations, who though he seme for to forsake vs for a time, yet he alone in the ende will caste downe our enemies. Sing this as the .cviii. O God, my harte prepared is, and eke my tong is so. I will aduaunce my voyce in song, and geuyng prayse also. Awake my viole and my harp, swete melody to make. And in the morning I my selfe, right early will awake. By me among the people, Lorde, still praysed shalt thou be, And I among the Heathen folke, will sing, O Lorde, to thee. Because thy mercie, Lorde is great, aboue the heauens hie, And eke thy truth doth reche the clouds within the lofty skye. Aboue the sterry heauens heighth exalt thy selfe, O God, And Lorde display vpon the earth. thy glory all abrode. That thy derely beloued may, be set at libertie. Helpe, O my God, with thy righte hand, and harken vnto me. God in his holines hath spoke: wherfore my ioyes abound, Sychem I shall diuide, and mete, the vale of Sucoth ground: And Gilead shall be myne owne, Manasses mine shall be, My hed strength Ephraim, and Law shall Iuda geue for me: Moab my washpot, and my shoe, on Edom will I throwe, Upon the land of Palestine, in triumph will I goo, Who shall into the citie strong, be guide to conduict me, Or who by whom to Edom land, conueyed shall I be? Is it not thou, O God, which late, hadst vs forsaken quyte: And thou O Lorde which with our host didst not goe fourth to fyght? Geue vs, O Lorde, thy sauing ayde, when trouble doth assayle: For all the helpe of man is vayne. and can no whit auayle. Through God we shal do valiant acts and worthy of renowne: He shall subdue our enemies, ye he shall treade them downe. Deus laudem meam. Psalme. Cix. N. Dauid being falslye accused by flatterers vnto Sawl, prayeth God to helpe him and to destroye his enemyes. And vnder them he speaketh of Iudas the traitour vnto Iesus Christ, and of all the like enemyes of the children of God: And desireth so to be deliuered, that his enemies may know the work of God, Then doth he promise to geue prayses vnto God. Sing this as the .lxxxxv. In specheles silence doo not holde, O God thy tong alwayes, O God, euen thou I say that art. the God of all my prayse. The wicked mouth and gilefull mouth, on me disclosed be, And they with false and lying tong, haue spoken vnto me. Euen so doo I departe away, as doth declynyng shade: And as the grashopper, so I am shaken of and fade. With fastyng longe from nedefull fode, enfebled are my knees: And all her fatnes hath my flesh, enforced ben to lese. And I also a vyle reproche, to them was made to be. And they that did vpon me loke: did shake theyr heds at me. But thou, O Lorde that art my God, myne ayde and succour be: Accordyng to thy merycy, Lorde, saue and delyuer me. And they shall know thereby, that thys (Lord) is thy myghty hand: And that thou thou hast done it, Lorde, so shall they vnderstande. Although they curse with spite, yet thou shalt bles with louyng voyce: They shall aryse and come to shame, thy seruant shall reioyse. Let them be clothed all with shame, that enmies are to me And with confusyon as a cloke, eke couerd let them be. But greatly I will with my mouthe, geue thankes vnto the Lorde, And I among the multitude hys prayses will recorde. For he with help at hys ryght hand, will stande the pooreman by, To saue hym from the men that wold condemne his soule to dye. Dixit dominus domino. Psalm. Cx. N. Dauid prophecyeth of the power and euerlastyng kyngdome geuen to Chryste and of hys Pristhod whyche shoulde put an ende to the Pristode of Leuy. Sing this as the .lxviii. Psalm. The Lorde did say vnto my Lorde, Sit thou at my right hande. Till I haue made thy foes a stoule, wheron thy fete shall stande. The Lorde shall out of Syon send, the scepture of thy myght: Amidde thy mortall foes be thou, the ruler in theyr syght. And in the day on which they reigne and power they shall see: Then hearby frewill offringes shall, thy people offer thee. Yea with a holy worshiping, then shall they offer all: Thy birthes dew is the dew that doth, from wombe of morning fall. The Lorde hath sworne and neuer will, repent what he doth say, By thorder of Melchisedech thou art a priest for ay. The Lord thy God on thy right hand, that standeth for thy stay Shal wound for thee the stately kings vpon his wrathfull day. The Heathen he shall iudge and fill, the place with bodies dead, And ouer diuerse contreyes shall in sonder smite the head. And he shall drink out of the broke, that runneth in the way: Therfore he shall lift vp on hye, his ryall hed that day. Confitebor tibi domine. Psalm. Cxi. N. He geueth thanks to the Lord for his mercifull works towards his church, &amp; declareth wherin true wisdom &amp; right knowledg c?sisteth. [1] With hart I doo accord To praise &amp; laud the Lord [2]In presence of the iuste: For great his workes are founde. [3]To search them suche are bounde, as doo hym loue and trust, [4]Hys workes are glorious: Also his rightousnes It doeth indure for euer, His wondrous works he wolde we still remembre shoulde, his mercye fayleth neuer. 5Suche as doo loue him beare, a porcion full faire. He hath vp for them laid: For this they shall well finde, He will them haue in minde, and kepe them, as he sayd. 6For he did not disdayne, his workes to shew them playne, By lightnings and by thunders, when he the Heathens land, Did geue into their hand, 7Of all his workes insueth bothe iudgement, right and truth, Wherto his statutes tend: 8they are decreed sure. For euer to endure, whiche equitie doth end: Redemption he gaue, his people for to saue, 9And hath also required, his promes not to fayle, But alwayes to preuayle. his holy name be feared. 10Whoso with hart full fayne, true wisdom wolde attayne, The Lorde feare and obey. suche as his Lawes doo kepe, Shall knowledge haue full depe, his prayse shall last for aye. Beatus vir. Psalme. Cxii. VV.K. He prayseth the felicitie of them that feare God, and condemneth the cursed state of the conteinners of God. [1] The man is blest that god doth feare And that his lawes doth loue in dede: [2]His sede on earth God will vpreare. And bles such as from him procede: [3]His house with good he will fulfill: His rightousnes endure shall still. 4Unto the righteous doth aryse, In trouble ioy, in darkenes light: Compassion in his eyes, and mercy alwayes in hys syght: 5Yea, pitie moueth suche to lend: he doeth by iudgement things expend. 6And surely suche shall neuer fayle: for in remembrance had is he; 7No tidings ill can make him quayle, who in the Lorde sure hope doeth se. 8His hart is firme, hys feare is past: for he shall se his foes downe cast. 9He did well for the poore prouide, his rightousnes shall still remayne, And his estate with prayse abyde, though that the wicked man disdaine 10Yea, gnash his teeth thereat shall he, and so consume his state to see. Laudate pueri. Psalme Cxiii. VV.K. An exhortation to prayse the Lorde for his prouidence, in that, that contrarye to the course of nature he worketh in hys Churche. [1] Ye childr?, which do serue y? lord, prayse ye his name with one accord, [2]yea, blessed be alwayes his name: who from the rising of the sunne, [3]til it returne where it begonne, is to be praysed with great fame. [4]The Lord all peoples doth surmount: As for his glory we may counte, [5]aboue the heauens hygh to be. With God the Lorde who may compare, whose dwellyngs in the heauens are? of such great power and force is he. 6He doeth abase him self, we knowe, thinges to beholde bothe here belowe, And also in heauen aboue, 7The nedie out of dust to drawe, And eke the poore, whiche helpe none saw, His onlye mercy did him moue: 8And so him set in high degre, with princes of great dignitie, That rule his people with great fame. 9The barren he doth make to beare, And with great ioye her frute to reare: therfore prayse ye his holy name. In exitu Israel. C.xiiii. VV. Whit. Howe the Israelites were delyuered out of Egipt, and of the wonderfull miracles that God shewed at that tyme, whiche put vs in remembraunce of Goddes great mercyes towardes his children and of oure vnthankfullnes for the same. Sing this as the .lxxviii. psa. [1] When Israell by Gods addres, from Pharos land was bent: And Iacobs house the straungers left, and in the same trayne went. 2In Iuda god his glory shewde, his holynes most bryght: So did the Israelites declare, his kingdom, power and myght, 3The sea it saw, and sodenly, as all amased did flee: The roring streaimes of Iordans floud, reculed backwardly. 4As rammes afrayde, the mountaines skipt, theyr strength did them forsake: And as the sely tremblyng lambes, theyr toppes did beate and shake, 5What ayled the sea, as all amased, so sodenly to flee? Ye rowlyng waues of Iordans floud, why ran ye backwardly? 6Why shoke ye hils as Rammes afrayd, why did your strength so shake: Why did your tops as trembling lambs for feare quiuer and quake. 7O earth confesse thy soueraygne Lord and dread hys myghty hand: Before the face of Iacobs God, feare ye both sea and land. 8I meane the God which fr? hard rocks doth cause many flouds appeare: And from the stony flint doth make, gush out the fountaynes cleare. Non nobis domine. Psalme. Cxv. N. A prayer of the faythful, oppressed by idolatrous tirants, against wh? they desire that God woulde succor them: for as muche as there is no comparyson betwene him and theyr false God, or Idoles, trustyng most constantly that God will preserue them in this theyr nede, seeyng that he hath adopted, and receaued them to hys fauoure: promising finally, that they will not be vnmindfull, of so greate a benefyte, if it would please God to heare theyr prayer, and delyuer them by his omnipotent power. [The first parte.] Not vnto vs, Lord, not to vs, but to thy name geue prayse, bothe for the mercy and the truthe. that are in thee alwayes. Why shall the Heathen scorners say, where is theyr God become? Our God in heauen is, and what, he will, that hath he done. Their idols siluer are and gold, worke of mens handes they be: They haue a mouth and do not speake: and eyes, and doo not see. And they haue eares ioynd to their heds and doo not heare at all: And noses eke they formed haue, and doo not smell withall. And handes they haue, and handle not: and feete and doo not goo: A throte they haue, yet through the same they make no sounde to blowe. Those that make them be like to them. and those whose trust they be. O Israell trust in the Lorde, their help and shield is he. O Aarons house trust in the Lorde: their helpe and shield is he: Trust ye the Lorde that feare the Lord their help and sheld is he. The Lord hath mindefull ben of vs, and will vs bles also: On Israels and Aarons house, his blissing he will shew. They did beset me round about, with wordes of hatefull spite: Without all cause of my desert, against me did they fight, For my good will they were my foes, but then gan I to pray: my good with ill, my frendlynes, with hate, they did repay, The second parte. Set thou the wicked ouer him, to haue the vpper hand: At his right hand eke suffer thou, his hatefull foe to stand. When he is iudged, let him then, condemned be therin: And let the prayer that he makes, be turned into sinne. Few be his dayes, his charge also, let thou an other take, His children let be fatherles, his wyfe a wydow make: Let his ofspring be vagabundes, to begge and seke theyr bread, Wandring out of the wasted place, where erst they haue ben fed. Let couetous extorcioner, catch all his goods and store, And let the straungers spoyle the frutes of all his toyle before. Let there be none to pitie him, let there be none at all: That on his children fatherles, will let their mercye fall. And so let his posteritie. for euer be destroyed: Their name out blotted in the age, that after shall succed. Let not his fathers wickednes, from Gods remembrance fall, And let thou not his mothers sinne, be done away at all. But in the presence of the Lorde, let them remayne for ay, That from the earth their memorye, he may cut cleane away. Sith mercye he forgat to shew, but did pursue with spite: The troubled man and sought to slay, the woefull harted wight. The third parte. As he did cursing loue, it shall, betide vnto him so: And as he did not blessing loue, it shalbe far him froe. As he with cursing clad himself, so it like water shall: Into his bowels, and like oyle, into his bones befall. As garment let it be to him, to couer him for ay, And as a girdle wherwith he, shall girded be alwaye. Lo let this same be from the Lord, the guerdon of my foe, Yea and of those that euell speake, against my soule also. But thou, O Lorde that art my God, deale thou I say with me. After thy name: delyuer me, for good thy mercies be: Because in depth of great distres, I nedy am and pore, And eke within my payned brest, my hart is wounded sore. Them that be fearers of the Lord, the lorde will blesse them all: Euen he will blesse them euery one, the great and eke the small. To you I say the louing Lord, will multiplie his grace, To you and to the children that, shall follow of your race. Ye are the blessed of the Lorde, euen of the lorde I say, Which both the heauen and the earth, hath made and set in stay. The heauens, yea the heauens hye, belong vnto the Lord: The earth vnto the sonnes of men, he gaue of free accorde. They that be dead doo not with prayse, set fourth the Lordes renoume, Nor any that into the place, of silence doo goe downe. But we will prayse the Lorde our god, from hencefourth and for ay Sound ye the prayses of the Lorde, prayse ye the Lorde I say. Dilexi quoniam. Psalme. Cxvi. N. Dauid being in great daunger of Saull in the desert of Mammon, perceiuing the great and inestimable loue of God toward him, mangnyfyeth suche great mercyes, and protesteth that he will be thankful for the same. Sing this as the .lxxxxv. I loue the Lord, because my voyce, and prayer hearde hath he: When in my dayes I cald on him, he bowed his eare to me, Euen when the snares of cruell death, about beset me round: When paynes of hell me caught, &amp; when I wo and sorow found. vpon the name of God my Lorde, then did I call, and say: Deliuer thou my soule, O Lorde, I doo thee humbly pray. The Lorde is very mercyfull, and iust he is also, And in our God compassion, doth plentifully flowe. The Lorde in safetie doth preserue, all those that simple be: I was in wofull miserye, and he releued me. And now my soule, sith thou art safe, returne vnto thy rest: For largely loe the Lorde to thee, his bountie hath exprest: Because thou hast delyuered, my soule from deadly thrall, My Moisted eien from mournful teares my slidyng fete from fall: Before the Lorde I in the land, of life will walke therfore. I did beleue, therfore I spake, for I was trobled sore. I sayd in my distres and feare. that all men lyers bee: What shall I pay the Lorde for all, his benefites to me? The holsome cup of sauing health, I thankefully will take: And on the Lordes name I will call, when I my prayer make. I to the Lorde will pay the vowes, that I haue him behight, Yea euen at this present time, in all his peoples sight. Right deare and precious in his sight, the Lorde doth ay esteme: The death of all his holy ones, what euer men do deme. Thy seruant Lorde, thy seruant loe, I doo my selfe confes, Son of thy handmayd thou hast broke the bonds of my distres And I will offer vp to thee, a sacryfyce of prayse: And I will call vpon the name, of God the Lorde alwayes. I to the Lorde will pay the voues, that I haue him behight, Yea euen at this present tyme, in all his peoples sight, Yea in the courtes of Gods owne house and in the middes of thee: O thou Ierusalem I say. wherfore the Lorde prayse ye. Laudate dominum. Psalme. Cxvii. N. He exhorteth the Gentels to prayse God, because he hath accomplished as well to them as to the Iewes, the promys of lyfe euerlastyng by Iesus Chryst. Sing this as the .lxxxxv. O all the natyons of the worlde, Prayse ye the Lorde alwayes: And all ye people euery where, set fourth hys noble prayse. For great his kindnes is to vs, his truthe endures for ay: Wherfore prayse ye the Lorde our God, prayse ye the Lorde I say: Confitemini domino. Psalme. Cxviii. M. Dauid reiectid of Saule and of the people, at the tyme apoynted obtained the kingdome, for the whiche he biddeth all them that feare the Lord, to be thankefull and vnder hys person, in all thys was Christ lyuely set forthe, who should be of hys people reiected. Sing this as a [illeg.] Psalme. O geue ye thankes vnto the Lorde, for gratious is he: Because his mercy doth endure. for euer towardes thee. Let Israell confes and say, hys mercy dures for ay: Now let the house of Aaron say, hys mercye dures for aye. Let all that feare the Lorde our God, euen now confesse and say: The mercye of the Lorde our God, endureth still for aye. In trouble and in heuines, vnto the Lorde I cride: Whiche louingly hard me at large, my sute was not denyde. The Lorde hym selfe is on my syde, I will not stande in dout: Nor feare what man can doo to me, when God standth me about. The lord doth take my parte with them. that helpe to succour me: Therfore I shall see my desire, apon myne enemye. Better it is to trust in God, then in mans mortall sede: Or to put confidence in kynges or princes in our nede. All nations haue in closed me, and compassed me rounde: But in the name of God shall I, myne enemies confounde. They kept me on euery side, they kept me in I say: But through the lords most mightie name, I shall worke theyr decay. They came about me all like bees, but yet in the lordes name: I quencht their thornes, that wer on fire and will destroy the same. Thou hast with force, thrust sore at me, that I in dede might fall: But through the lord I found suche help that they wer vanquist all. The lorde is my defence and strengthe my ioy, my mirth and song: He is become for me in dede, a sauiour most strong. The right hand of the lord our God, doth bring to pas great thinges: He causeth voyce of ioy and health, in rightous mennes dwellynges, The right hand of the lorde doth bring most mighty thinges to pas: his hand hath the preeminens, his force is, as it was, I will not dye but euer lyue. to vtter and declare: The lord his might, &amp; wondrous power his workes and what they are. The lorde himselfe hath chastened, and hath corrected me: But hath not geuen me ouer yet, to death as ye may see. Set open vnto me the gates, of truth and righteousnes: That I may enter into them, the lordes prayse to confes. This is the gate euen of the lorde, whiche shall not so he shut: But good and righteous men alway. shall enter into it. I will geue thankes to thee O Lorde, because thou hast heard me: And art become most louingly, a sauiour vnto me. The stone whiche ere this time among the builders was refused: is now become the corner stone, and chefely to be vsed. Thys was the myghty work of God, this was the Lordes owne fact, And it is maruelous to be holde, with eyes that noble act. This is the ioyfull day in dede, which God himself hath wrought: Let vs be glad and ioy therin, in hart, in mind and thought. Now helpe me Lorde and prosper vs, we wishe with one accorde: Blessed be he that comes to vs, in the name of the Lorde. God is the Lorde that sheweth vs lyght: bynde ye therfore with corde: Your sacrifice to the alter, and geue thankes to the Lorde. Thou art my God I will confes, and render thankes to thee: Thou art my God, and I will prayse, thy mercy towardes me. O geue ye thankes vnto the Lorde, for gratious is he: Because his mercy dothe endure, for euer towardes thee. Beati immaculati. Psalm Cxix. VV.VV.

Then all the treasures of the earth, which worldlings make theyr mede. 15Of thy precepts I will still muse, and therfore frame my talke: As at a marke so will I aime, thy wayes how I may walke. 16My only ioy shalbe so fixed, and on thy lawes so set: That nothyng can me so far blynde, that I thy wordes for get.

The .vii. parte. ZAIN 49Thy promise whiche thou madst to me thy seruaunt (Lorde) remember: For therin haue I put my trust, and confidence for euer. 50It is my comfort and my ioy, when troubles me assayle: For were my lyfe not by thy worde, my lyfe would sone me fayle. 51The proude, and suche as God contemn still made of me a skorne: Yet would I not, thy law forsake, as he that were forlorne: 52But cald to mind (lord) thy great works shewde to our fathers olde: Wherby I felt the ioy surmount, my grief an hundred folde. 53But yet, alas, for feare I quoke, seing how wicked men: Thy law forsoke and did procure, thy iudgment: who knoweth when 54And as for me, I framed my songs, thy statutes to exalt: When I among the straungers dweld, and thoughtes gan me assalt. 55I thought vpon thy name, O Lorde, by nyght when others slepe: As for thy law, also I kept, and euer will it kepe. 56This grace I did obteyne, because, thy couenants swete and deare: I did embrace, and also kepe, with reuerence and with feare. The .viii. parte. HETH 57O God, which art my part and lot, My comfort and my stay: I haue decreed, and promised, thy lawe to kepe alway. 58Mine earnest hart did humbly sue, in presence of thy face: As thou therfore hast promised, Lorde graunt me of thy grace. 59My lyfe I haue examined, and tryde my secrete hart: Whiche to thy statutes caused me, my fete strayght to conuert. 60I did not stay nor linger long, as they that slouthfull are: But hastely thy lawes to kepe, I did my selfe beware. 61The cruell bandes of wicked men, haue made of me theyr pray: Yet would I not thy law forget, nor from thee go astray. 62Thy rightous iudgment shewd toward me so great is and so hie: That euen at midnight will I ryse, thy name to magnifye. 63Companion am I to all them, whiche feare thee in theyr hart: And neyther will for loue nor dread. from thy commaundements start: 64Thy mercies (Lorde) most plentuously doo all the worlde fulfyll. Oh teache me how I may obey, thy statutes and thy will. The .ix. parte. TETH 65According to thy promise Lorde, so hast thou with me delt: For of thy grace in sundry sorts, haue I thy seruaunt felt. 66Teache me to iudge alwayes a ryght, and geue me knowledge sure, For certenly beleue I doo. that thy precepts are pure. 67Yet thou didst touche me with thy rod, I erred and went astray: But now I kepe thy holy word, and make it all my stay, 68Thou art both good and gratious, and geuest most liberally: Thy ordinaunces how to kepe, therfore (O Lord) teache me. 69The proud and wicked m? haue forged, against me many a lye: Yet thy commaundements still obserue, with all my hart will I. 70Their harts are swolne with worldly welth as gras so are they sat: But in thy law doo I delyte, and nothyng seke but that. 71Oh happy tyme may I well say, when thou didst me correct: For as a guide to learne thy lawes, thy rods did me direct. 72So that to me thy worde and law, is dearer manifold: Then thousands great of siluer &amp; golde, or ought that can be tolde. The .x. parte. IOD 73Seing thy hands haue made me Lord to be thy creature: Graunt knowledg likewise how to learne to put thy lawes in vre. 74So they that feare thee shall reioyce, when euer they me see: Because I haue learned by thy worde, to put my trust in thee. 75When with thy rods, y? world is plagd I know the cause is iust: So when thou didst correct me Lorde, the cause iust nedes be must. 76Now of thy goodnes I thee pray, some comforte to me send: As thou to me thy seruaunt herest, so from all ill me shend. 77Thy tender mercies power on me, and I shall surely lyue: For ioy and consolation bothe, thy lawes to me doth geue. 78Confound the proud whose false pret?ce is me for to destroy: But as for me thy hestes to know, I will my selfe employ. 79Who so with reuerence doo thee feare, to me let them retire: And suche as doo thy couenants knowe and them alone desire. 80My hart without all waueryng, let on thy lawes be bent: That no confusion come to me, wherby I should be shent, The .xi. parte. GAPH 81My soule doth faynt and ceaseth not, thy sauing health to craue: And for thy wordes sake still I trust, my hartes desyre to haue. 82Mine eyes doo fayle with loking for, thy word and thus I say: Oh when wilte thou me comfort Lorde: why dost thou thus delay? 83As a skin bottell in the smoke, so am I partcht and dryed: Yet will I not out of my hart, let thy commaundement slide, 84Alas how long shall I yet lyue, before I see the houre. That on my foes whyche me torment, thy vengeaunce thou wilt power. 85Pres?ptuous men haue digged pittes, thinking to make me sure: Thus contrary agaynst thy law, my hurte they doo procure. 86But thy commaundements are al true, and causeles they me greue: To thee therfore I doo complayne, that thou mightest me relieue. 87Almost they had me cleane destroide, and brought me quite to grounde: Yet by thy statutes I abode. and therin succor founde. 88Restore me, Lorde, agayne to lyfe, for thy mercyes excell: And so shall I thy couenants kepe, till death my lyfe expell. The .xii. parte, LAMID 89In heauens lord where thou dost dwel thy word is stablished sure: And shall for all eternitie, fast grauen there indure. 90From age to age thy truth abideth, as doth the earth witnes: Whose ground work thou hast layd so sure as no tounge can expres. 91Euen to thys day we may well see, how all thynges perseuer: Accordyng to thy ordinance, for all thinges thee reuere. 92Had it not ben that in thy lawe, my soule had comfort sought: Long time yere now in my distres, I had ben brought to nought. 93Therfore will I thy precepts aye, in memory kepe fast: By them thou hast my lyfe restorde, when I was at last cast, 94No wight to me can title make, for I am onely thyne: Saue me therfore for to thy lawes, myne eares and hart inclyne. 95The wicked men doo seke my bane, and therto lye in wayte: But I the while considered, thy notable actes and great. 96I see nothyng in this wide world, at length which hath not ende: But thy commaundement and thy word beyond all end extende. The .xiii. parte. MEM 97What great desire and feruent loue, doo I beare to thy lawe: All the day long my whole deuyse, is only on thy lawe. 98Thy worde hath taught me far to pas, my foes in polycye: For still I kepe it as a thyng, of most excellencye. 99My teachers whiche did me instruct, in knowledge I excell: Because I doo thy couenauntes kepe, and them to others tell. 100In wisdome I doo pas also, the auncient men in dede: And all because to kepe thy lawes, I helde it aye best rede. 101My fete I haue refrayned eke, from euery euyll way: Because that I continually, thy worde might kepe, I say, 102I haue not swarued from thy iudgm?ts nor yet shronk any dell: For why? thou hast taught me therby to lyue godly and well. 103Oh Lorde howe swete vnto my tast, fynde I thy wordes alwaye? Doubtles no hony in my mouth, fele ought so swete I may. 104Thy lawes haue me such wisd? learnd that vtterly I hate: All wicked and vngodly wayes, in euery kinde or rate. The .xiiii. parte. NVN 105Euen as a lanterne to my fete, so doth thy word shine bryght: And to my pathes, where euer I go, it is a flamyng lyght. 106I haue both sworne and will perform, most certenly doubtles: That I will kepe thy iudgments iust and them in lyfe expres. 107Affliction hath me sore oppressed, and brought me to deathes dore O Lorde as thou hast promised, so me to lyfe restore. 108The offrings which with hart &amp; voyce most frankly I thee geue: Accept, and teache me how I may, after thy iudgements lyue. 109My soule is aye so in my hande, that daungers it assayle: Yet doo I not thy law forget, nor it to kepe will fayle, 110Although the wicked layd their nets, to catche me at a bray: Yet did I not from thy precepts, once swerue or go astray. 111Thy lawe I haue so claymed alway, as mine owne heritage: And why? for therin I delyte, and set my whole courage. 112For euermore I haue ben bent, thy statutes to fullfill: Euen so lyke wyse vnto the ende, I will continue styll. The .xv. parte. SAMECH 113The crafty thoughts and double hart, I doo alwayes detest: But as for thy law and precepts, I loued them euer best. 114Thou art my hid and secret place, my shield of strong defence: Therfore haue I thy promises, loked for with pacience. 115Go to therfore ye wicked men: depart from me anone: For the commaundments will I kepe, of God my Lorde alone. 116As thou hast promisd so performe, that death me not assayle. Nor let my hope abuse me so, that through distrust I quayle. 117Uphold me and I shalbe safe, for ought they doo or say: And in thy statutes pleasure take, will I bothe night and day. 118Thou hast trod suche vnder thy fete, as do thy statutes breake: For nought auayleth theyr subtiltie, theyr counsell is but weake. 119Like drosse thou castes the wicked oute, where euer they go or dwell: Therfore can I as thy statutes, loue nothyng halfe so well. 120My fleshe alas, is taken with feare, as though it were benomde: For when I see thy iudgmentses strayt I am as one astounde. The .xvi. parte. AIN 121I doo the thyng that lawfull is, and geue to all men right: Resigne me not to them that would, oppresse me with their might. 122But for thy seruaunt surty be, in that thing that is good: That proud men geue me not the foyle, which rage as they were wood. 123Mine eies with waiting are now blind thy health so muche I craue: And eke thy righteous promise Lorde, wherby thou wilt me saue. 124Intreate thy seruaunt louingly, and fauour to him shew: Thy statutes of most excellence, teache me also to knowe. 125Thy humble seruaunt, Lorde I am, oh graunt me to vnderstand: Howe by thy statutes I may know, best what to take in hand. 126It is now time (Lorde) to begin, for truthe is quyte decayd: Thy law lykwyse they haue transgrest and none against them sayd. 127Thys is the cause wherfore I loue, thy lawes better then gold: Or iewels fine which are estemd, most costly to be sold, 128I thought thy precepts all most iust, and so them layd in store: All crafty and malicious wayes, I doo abhorre therfore. The .xvii. parte. PE 129Thy couenaunts are most wonderfull and full of thynges profound: My soule therfore doth kepe them sure when they are tride and found. 130When men first enter into thy wordes, they finde a lyght most cleare: And very idiots vnderstand, when they it reade or heare. 131For ioie I haue both gaped &amp; breathed, to know thy commaundement: That I might guide my lyfe therby. I sought what thyng it ment. 132With mercy and compassion Lord, beholde me from aboue: As thou art wont to behold suche, as thy name feare and loue. 133Direct my fote steppes by thy worde, that I thy will may know: And neuer let iniquitie, thy seruaunt ouerthrow, 134From slaunderous tonges and deadly harms preserue &amp; kepe me sure. Thy precepts then I will obserue, and put them eke in vre, 135Thy countena?ce which doth surmo?t the sunne in his bright hew: Let shine on me: and by thy lawe, teache me what to eschew. 136Out of mine eyes great flods gush out, of drery teares and fell: When I beholde how wicked men. thy law kepe neuer a dell. The .xviii. parte. ZADE 137In euery point (Lord) thou art iust, the wicked though they grudge: And when thou dost sent?ce pronunce, thou art a righteous iudge, 138To render right and flie from guile, are two chief pointes most hye. And suche as thou hast in thy law, commaunded vs streightly. 139With zele and wrath I am consumde, and euen pyned awaye: To see my foes thy wordes forget, for ought that I doo may. 140So pure and perfect is thy word, as any hart can deme: And I thy seruaunt nothing more, doo loue or yet esteme. 141And though I be nothing set by, as one of base degree: Yet doo I not thy hestes forget, nor shrinke awaye from thee. 142Thy righteousnes (Lorde) is most iust for euer to endure: Also thy law is truth it selfe, most constant and most pure. 143Trouble and grief haue seased on me, and brought me wondrous lowe: Yet doo I still of thy precepts, delyght to heare and know. 144The righteous of thy iudgements, doo last for euermore: Then teache them me, for euen in them, my lyfe lyeth vp in store. The .xix. parte. BOPH 145With feruent heart I callde and crid now answere me (O Lord: That thy commaundement to obserue, I may fully accord. 146To thee (my God) I make my sute, with most humble request: Saue me therfore, and I will kepe, thy precept and thy hest. 147To thee I crye, euen in the morne, before the day waxe lyght: Because that I haue in thy word, my confidence whole plyght. 148Mine eyes preuent the watch by night and yere they call, I wake: That by deuisyng of thy word, I might some comfort take. 149Incline thyne eares to heare my voice and pitie on me take: As thou wast wont so iudge me Lorde, lest lyfe me should forsake. 150My foes draw nere and doo procure, my deathe malitiously: Which from thy law are far gone back, and straid from it leudly. 151Therfore (O Lorde) approche thou nere, for nede doth so require: And all thy precepts true they are, then helpe I thee desyre. 152By thy c?maundements I haue learnd not now, but longe ago: That they remayne for euermore, thou hast them grounded so. The .xx. parte. RES 153My trouble and affliction, consider and beholde: Delyuer me, for of thy lawe, I euer take fast holde, 154Defend my good and righteous cause, with spede me succor send: From death as thou hast promised, Lorde kepe me and defend. 155As for the wicked farre they are, from hauing health and grace: Wherby they might thy statutes know they enter not the trace. 156Great are thy mercyes, Lord I graunt what tong can them atteyne? And as thou haste me iudged yer now, so let me lyfe obteyne. 157Though many men did trouble me, and persecute most sore: Yet from thy lawes I neuer shronk, nor went awry therfore. 158And truth it is, for grief I dye, when I these traitors see. Because they kepe no whit thy worde, nor yet seke to know thee. 159Beholde, for I doo loue thy lawes, with hart most glad and fayne: As thou art good and gratious Lorde, restore my lyfe agayne. 160What thy word doth decree, must be, and so it hath bene euer, Thy rightuous iudgements are also, most true and decay neuer. The .xxi. parte. SCHIN 161Princes haue sought by crueltye, causeles to make me crouche: But all in vayne, for of thy word, the feare did my hart touche, 162And certenly euen of thy word, I was more mery and glad Then he that of ryche spoyles and pray, great store and plentye had. 163As for all lyes and falsitie, I hate most and detest: For why? thy holy law doo I, aboue all thinges loue best. 164Seuen times a day I prayse the Lord singing with hart and voyce: Thy rightuous actes and wonderfull, so cause me to reioyse. 165Great peace and rest shall all such haue whiche doo thy statutes loue: Nor danger shall theyr quiet state, impere or once remoue. 166My only health and comfort Lorde, I loke for at thy hand: And therfore haue I done those things, whiche thou didst me commaunde. 167Thy lawes haue ben my exercise, whiche my soule most desired: So muche my loue to them was bent, that nought els I required. 168Thy statutes and commaundements, I kept thou knowest a ryght: For all the things that I haue done, are present in thy syght. The .xxii. parte. TAV 169O Lorde let my complaynt and crye, before thy face appeare: And as thou hast me promise made, so teache me thee to feare. 170Mine humble supplication, toward thee, let find acces: And graunt me Lord deliueraunce, for so is thy promes. 171Then all my lippes thy prayses speake, after most ample sort: When thou thy statutes hast me taught, wherin standeth all comfort: 172My tong shall sing and preache thy word and on this wise say shall: Gods famous actes and noble lawes, are iust and perfect all. 173Stretch out thy hand I thee beseche, and spedely me saue: For thy commaundments to obserue, chosen, O Lorde I haue. 174Of thee alone, Lorde I craue health, for other I know none: And in thy law and nothyng els, I doo delyte alone. 175Graunt me therfore long dayes to lyue, thy name to magnifye: And of thy iudgements mercifull, let me thy fauor trye. 176For I was lost and went astraye, muche lyke a waydryng shepe: Oh seke me, for I haue not fayled, thy commaundmentes to kepe. Ad dominum cum tribularer. Psal. cxx. T.S. The praier of Dauid beyng now banished among the barbarious people of Arabia, by the false reports of enuious flatterers. And therefore he lamenteth his long abode amonge those infidels, who were geuen to all kind of wickednes and contetion. [1] In trouble and in thrall, vnto the Lord I call: [2]&amp; he doth me c?fort: deliuer me (I say) [3]fr? liers lips alway, And tong of false report. 4What vantage, or what thyng, Getst thou thus for to sting. Thou false and flattering lyer? 5Thy tongue doth hurt I wene, No les then arrowes kene, Of whote consuming fire. 6Alas to longe I slake, Within these tentes so blake, Whiche kedars are by name: By whom the flocke elect, And of Isaackes sect. Are put to open shame. 7With them that peace did hate, I came a peace to make, And set a quyet lyfe: 8But when my worde was tolde, Causeles I was controld, By them that would haue stryfe. Leuaui oculos meos. Cxxi. VV.VV. The Prophet shewed by his owne example that the faythful ought to loke for all their succor of God alone, who will gouerne and geue good successe to all theyr godly enterpryses. [1] I lyfte mine eies to Sion hill, fr? whence I doo attend, that succor God me send. [2]The mighty God me succor will, which heau? and earth framed, &amp; all things therin named. 3Thy fote from slip he will preserue, And will thee safely kepe: For he will neuer slepe. 4Lo he that doth Israll conserue, No slepe at all can him catche? But his eyes shall euer watche, 5The Lorde is thy warrant alway, The Lorde eke doth thee couer, As at thy ryght hand euer. 6The sunne shall not thee parche by day, Nor the mone not halfe so bryght. Shall with could thee hurt by night. 7The Lorde will kepe thee from distres, And wyll thy lyfe sure saue: And thou also shalt haue. 8In all thy busines good successe, Where euer thou goest in or out, God will thy thinges bring about. Letatus sum. Psalme. Cxxii. VV.K. Dauid reioyceth in the name of the faythfull that God hathe accomplished his promes, and placed his Arke in Sion, for the whiche he geueth thankes, and prayeth for the prosperitie of the Church. [1] I did in hart reioyce, to heare y? peples voyce, in offering so willingly: For let vs vp say they, and in the Lordes house pray: thus spake the folke full louingly. [2]Oure fete that wandred wide, shal in thy gates abide, O thou Ierusalem full fayre, Which arte so semely set, muche lyke a Citie net, the like wherof is not els where. 4The trybes with one accorde, The tribes of God the Lorde, Are thither bent theyr way to take: So God before did tell That there his israell. Their prayers shoulde together make. 5For there are thrones erect, And that for this respect. To set forth iustice orderly. Which thrones right to mainteine, To dauids house perteine, His folke to iudge accordingly. 6To pray let vs not cease, For Ierusalems peace, Thy friendes God prosper mightely. 7Peace be thy walles about, And prosper the throughout, Thy places eke continually. 8I wish thy prosperous state, For my poore brethrens sake, That comfort haue by meanes of the. 9Gods house doth me allure, Thy welth for to procure So much all wayes as lieth in me. Ad te leuaui oculos Psalm. Cxxiii. Th. Stern. A praier of the faithfull which are afflicted by the wicked worldelinges and contemners of God. Singe this as the .xxiii. Psal. [1] O Lord that heuen doest possesse, I lift mine eies to the, Euen as the seruant lifteth his, his maisters handes to see. 2As handmaides watch there maistres handes, some grace for to atchiue, So we beholde the Lord our God, til he do vs forgeue. 3Lorde graunt vs thy compassion, and mercy in thy sight: For we be filled and ouer comen, with hatred and despight. 4Our mindes be stuffed with great rebuke, the rich and worldly wise: To make af vs their mocking stock, the proude do vs despice. Nisi quia dominus. Psalm. Cxxiiii. VV. The people of God, beyng delyuered out of a great danger, acknowledg not to haue escaped by their owne power, but throughe the fauour of God, and shew in how greate perill they were. [1] Nowe Israell may say, &amp; that truly, If that the Lord had not our cause mainteind. If that the lord had not our right susteind. [2]Wh? all the worlde against vs furiously, made their vprors, and said we should all die. 3Now long a go they had deuoure vs all: And swalowed quick, for ought y? we could deme, Suche was their rage, as we might well esteme. 4And as the flouddes, with mightye force do fall, So had they now, our life euen brought to thrall. 5The raging stremes, most proud in roring noice Had long a go, ouer whelmde vs in the depe, 6But loued by God whiche doth vs safely kepe, From bloudy teeth, and theyr most cruell voyce. Which as a pray to eate vs woulde reioyce. 7Euen as the birde out of the foulers grenne, Escapth away? right so it fareth vs: Broke are theyr nets, and we haue scaped thus, 8God that made heauen, &amp; earth, is our help th?, His name hath saued vs from these wicked men. Qui confidunt. Psalm. cxxv. VV.K. He describeth the assurance of the faithfull in their aflictions, and desireth their welth, and the destruction of the wicked. [1] Suche as in God the lord do trust, as Mount Sion shall firmely stande, and be remoued at no hand, the Lorde will count them right and iust, So that they shall be sure, For euer to indure. 2As mightye mountains huge and greate, Ierusalem about to close. So will the Lorde be vnto those, who on his godly will doo wayte. Suche are to hym so deare, they neuer nede to feare. 3For though the rightous trye doeth he, by making wicked men his rodde: Lest they through grief forsake their God, it shall not as their lot still be. 4Geue, Lorde, to those thy lyght, whose hartes are true and ryght. 5But as for such as turne asyde, by croked wayes which they out sought, The Lorde will surely bryng to nought, with workes vile they shall abide: But peace with Israell, for euermore shall dwel. In conuertendo. Psalm. cxxvi. VV.K. This Psalme was made after the returne of the people from Babylon, and sheweth that the meane of their deliuerance was wonderful, after the seuentie yeres of captiuitie forespoken by Ieremie .25.12. and .29.10. [1] When that the Lorde again his Si? had forth brought from bondage great, &amp; also seruitude extreme, [2]his work was suche, as did surmount mans hart &amp; thought, so that we were muche like to them that vse to dreame: our mouthes were with laughter filled then, and eke our tongues did shew vs ioyfull men. The Heathen folke were forced then, this to confes, How that the Lord for them also great things had don, 3But muche more we, and therfore can confes no les: Wherfore to ioye we haue good cause as we begonne 4O Lorde, go forthe, thou canst our bondage end, As to desertes thy flowing riuers send. 5Full true it is, that they whiche sow with teares in dede, A time will come, when they shal reape in mirth &amp; ioye 6They went and wept in bearing of their precious sede. For that theyr foes full often times did them anoye: But their returne with ioye they shall sure see, Their sheaues home bryng, and not impered be. Nisi dominus. Psalme. Cxxvii. VV. It is not mannes wit, power, or labor, but the free goodnes of God that geueth ryches, preserueth townes and countreyes, graunteth noryshment and chyldren. Sing this as the lords prayer. [1] Except the Lorde the house doo make, And therunto doo set hys hande: What men doo build, it can not stand. Likewise in vayne men vndertake, Cities and holdes to watch and ward, Except the Lord be their safegard. 2Though ye ryse early in the morne, And so at night go late to bed, Feding full hardly with browne breade: Yet were your labor lost and worne, But they whom God doth loue and kepe Receyue all thinges with quiet slepe. 3Therfore marke well, when euer ye see, That men haue heires to enioy their l?d: It is the gift of Gods owne hand, For God him selfe doth multiplye, Of his great liberalitie, The blessing of posteritie. 4And when the children come to age, They grow in strength and actiuenes, In person, and comelines, So that a shaft shot with courage, Of one that hath a most strong arme, Flyeth not so swyft, nor doth lyke harme 5Oh well is him that hath his quiuer, Fournished with such altilerye: For when in perill he shalbe, Suche one shall neuer shake nor shiuer. When that he pleadeth before the iudge, Against his foes which beare him grudg Beati omnes qui timent.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Psalm. cxxviii. T.T. He describeth the prosperous estate of them that be maryed in the feare of God, ioyning with all the promises of Gods blessinges, to all them that lyue in thys honorable estate, accordyng to his commaundementes. Sing thys as the .cxxxvii. [1] Blessed art thou that fearest God, and walkest in his way: 2For of thy labor thou shalt eate, happye arte thou (I say.) 3Like frutefull vynes on thy house sydes, so doth thy wyfe spryng out: Thy children stande lyke Oliue plantes, thy table round about. 4Thus art thou blest that fearest God, and he shall let thee see: 5The promised Ierusalem, and hys felicitye. 6Thou shalt thy childrens children see, to thy great ioyes increase: And likewyse grace on Israell, prosperitie and peace. Sepe expugnauerunt Psal. cxxix. VV.VV. He admonisheth the churche to reioyce, though it haue ben afflicted in all ages, for God will delyuer it, and the enemies, for all their glorious shew, shall sodenly be destroyed. [1] Of Israell thys may now be the song, eu? fr? my youth my foes haue oft me noied A thousand euils since, I was t?dre &amp; yonge They haue wrought, yet was I not destroyed. 2As yet I beare the marks in bone and skyn. that one wold think y? the plow m? w? their plowes Upon my back haue made their balkes far in: For like plowd gro?d, eu? so haue I l?g forowes. 3But yet the Lorde, which doth all things iustly, Hath cut the ropes, &amp; so slayd the wicked rage, 4Euen so shall all suche perish shamefully, Whiche hate Sion, or wish it any damage. 5Al such men shalbe lyke the gras that groweth Upon the wales, or tops of houses most hye, Whiche sodenly, or one bewar, widereth: So that no frute on such herbes can gathered be, 6Neuer man saw, that any mower mowed, Suche grasse as that, or therof his hand did fill: Much les that he, which glaineth of y? is sowed, Under his arme bare, some thing his house vntill. 7Nor yet that he, that passeth by that way Sayth to the repers, God saue you, or God spede, No no man doth wishe them good lucke, I saye, Or pray y? God, would for their work graunt th? mede Deprofundis clamaui. Psalme. cxxx. VV.VV. An effectuous prayer of hym that for his sinnes had susteyned great afflictions, and not withstanding, he fully trusteth, and assureth him selfe to obteyne mercy and forgeuenes of his synnes, and at length deliuereth from all euilles. [1] Lord to the I make my mone. wh? da?gers me oppres. I call, I sigh plain and grone. Trusting to finde reles. [2]Heare now, O Lord, my request. For it is full due tyme: And let thyne eares aye be prest, vnto thys prayer myne. 3O Lorde our God if thou way, our sinnes and them peruse: Who shall then escape, and say, I can my selfe excuse? 4But Lord thou art mercifull, and turnest to vs thy grace: That we with harts most carefull, should feare before thy face. 5In God I put my whole trust, my soule wayteth on his wyll: For his promise is most iust, and I hope therin styll. 6My soule to God hath regarde, wishing for him alway: More then they that watch and ward, to see the dauning day. 7Let Israell then boldly, in the Lorde put his trust: He is that God of mercy, that his deliuer must. 8For he it is that must saue, Israell from his sinne: And all suche as surely haue, their c?fidence in him. Domine non est. Psalme. Cxxxi. M. Dauid charged with ambytion and gredye desire to raygne, protesteth his humilitie and modestye before God, and teacheth all men, what they should doo. Sing this as the lamentati? O Lorde I am not puft in minde, I haue no skornfull eye: I doo not exercyse my selfe, in thynges that be to hye. But as a childe that wayned is, euen from his mothers brest: So haue I Lorde behaued my selfe, in sylence and in rest. O Israell trust in the Lorde, let hym be all thy stay: From this tyme forth for euermore, from age to age I say. Memento domine. Psalme. Cxxxii. M. The faythfull, groundyng on Gods promise made vnto Dauid, desireth that he would establysh the same, bothe as touchyng hys posterytie and the buylding of the temple, to praye there as was forespoken. Rem?ber dauids trobles lord how to the Lord he sware, &amp; voud a vow to Iacobs god to kepe for euermore I wil not com within my house, nor clyme vp to my bed, nor let my temples take their rest, or the eyes in my hed. Till I haue found out for the Lorde, a place to set theron: An house for Iacobs God to be, an habitacyon. We harde of it at Ephrata, there did we heare this sounde: And in the fildes and forrestes there. these voyces fyrst were found. We will assay and go in nowe, his tabernacle there: Before his forstole to fall doune, apon our knees in feare. Arise O Lorde aryse I say, into thy restyng place: Both thou and the eeke of thy strengthe, the presence of thy grace. Let all thy prestes be clothed Lorde, with truthe and righteousnes: Let all thy sayntes and holy men, sing all with ioyfulnes. And for thy seruaunt Dauids sake, refuse not Lorde I say: The face of thyne annoynted Lorde, or turn thy face away. The Lorde to Dauid swore in truth, and will not shrink from it: Saying, the frute of thy body, apon thy seate shall syt. And if thy sonnes my couenant kepe, that I shall learne eche one: Then shall theyr sonnes for euer syt, apon thy princely throne, The Lorde himselfe hath chose Syon, and loue therein to dwell: Saying thys is my restyng place, I loue and like it well. And I will blesse, with great increase, her vittales, euery where: And I will satisfye with bread, the nedy that be there. Yea I will decke, and cloth her pristes, with my saluation: And all her sainctes shall sing for ioye, of my protection. There will I surely make the horne, of Dauid for to bud. For I haue there, ordaynde for myne, a lanthorne bright and good. As for his enmyes, I will clothe, with shame for euermore: But I will cause his crowne to shine. more fresh then here to fore. Ecce quam bonum. Psalm. cxxxiii. VV.VV. This psalme conteyneth the commendation of godly and brotherly amitie, which for thexcellencye therof is compared to the most pretious oyle, wherwith the Priestes only and instruments of the tabernacle wer annoynted, Exodus. xxx. Sing thys as the .cxxxvii. [1] O how happye a thyng it is, and ioyfull for to see: Brethern together fast to holde, the bande of amitie. 2It callth to minde that swete perfume, and that costly oyntment: Which on the sacrifisers head, by Gods precept was spent. It wet not Aarons head alone, but drencht his beard throughout: And finally it did runne down, his ritche attire about. 3And as the lower ground doth drynke, the dew of Hermon hill: And Sion with his siluer droppes, the fields with fruite doth fill. 4Euen so the Lorde doth poure on them, his blessings manifold: Whose hartes and myndes without all guile, this knot doo kepe and hold. Ecce nunc. Psalme. Cxxxiiii. VV.K. He exhorteth the Leuites that watch in the temple to prayse the Lorde. [1] Behold, &amp; haue regard, ye seruants of the Lorde, which in his house by night do watch, prayse him with one accorde. 2Lyft vp your hands on high, vnto his holy place, And geue the Lorde his prayses due: his benefites embrace. 3For why? the Lord, who did, both earth and heauen frame, Doeth Sion bles and will conserue, for euer more the same. Laudate nomen. Psalme. Cxxxv. M. He exhorteth all the faithful, of what estate so euer they be, to praise God for his merueylous worcks, &amp; specially for his graces towards his people, wherein he hath declared his maiestie. To the confession of all Idolaters and theyr Idolls. O praise y? lord praise him praise him, praise him with one accord, o praise him stil al ye that be the seruaunts of y? lord, o praise him ye that stand &amp; be, in the house of the Lord, ye of his court and of his house praise hym with one accord. Prayse ye the Lord for he is good, syng prayses to his name: It is a comly, and good thing, alwayes to doo the same. For why the Lorde, hath chose Iacob, his very owne, you see: So hath he chosen Israell, his treasure for to be. For this I know, and am right sure, the Lorde is very greate: He is in dede aboue all Goddes, most easy to intreate, For what so euer pleased him, all that fulwell he wrought: In heauen, in earthe, and in the sea, whiche he hath framde of nought. He lifteth vp cloudes, euen from the earthe, he makth the lightnings and rayne: He bringkth forth the windes also, He made nothing in vayne. He smote the first borne of eche thing, in Egipt that toke rest: He spared there, no lyuing thyng, the man, nor yet the beast, He hathe in thee, shewde wonders great, O Egipt voyde of vauntes, On Pharao thy cursed kyng, and his seuere seruauntes. He smote then many nacyons, and did great actes and thynges, He slew the great and mightyest, and chefest of theyr kynges. Syhon king of Ammorites, and Og kyng of Basan: He slew also the kingdomes all, that were of Canaan. And gaue their lande to Israell, an herytage we see: To Israell, his owne people, an heritage to be. Thy name O Lorde, shall still endure, and thy memoriall: Throughout all generations, that are, or euer shall, The Lorde will surely auenge, his people all in dede. And to his seruauntes, he will shewe, fauour in tyme of nede. The Idols of the Heathen are made, in all theyr coste and landes: Of syluer and of golde be they, the workes euen of mens handes. They haue mouthes and cannot speake. and eyes toat haue no sight They haue eares, that heare nothyng, Theyr mouthes, be breatheles quite. Wherfore all they, are lyke to them, that so doth set them forth: And lykewyse those, that trust in them, or thinke they be ought worth. O all ye house of Israell, see that ye prayse the Lorde, And ye that be of Aarons house, prayse him, with one accord. And ye that be of Leuis house, prayse ye lykewise the Lorde, And all that stand in awe of hym, prayse him, with one accord. And out of Syon, sound his prayse, the great prayse of the Lorde: Whiche dwelleth in Ierusalem, praise him with one accord. Confitemini Psalme. Cxxxvi. N. A most earnest exhortaci? to geue thanks vnto God for the creation and gouernaunce of all thinges, which standeth in confessing that he geueth vs all of his mere liberalitie. [1] Praise ye y? lord for he is good, for hys mercy endureth for euer, [2]Geue prayse vnto the God of Gods, for his mercy endureth for euer [3]Geue prayse vnto the Lorde of Lordes, for his mercy endureth for euer [4]which only doth great w?ders work, for his mercy endureth for euer. 5Which by his wisdome made the heauens, for his mercy endureth for euer: 6Which on the waters stretcht the earth, for his mercy endureth for euer. 7Which made great light to shine abrode, for his mercy endureth for euer: 8As sonne to rule the lightsome day, for his mercy endureth for euer. 9The mone and sterres to guide the night, for his mercy endureth for euer. 10Whiche smote Egipt with their first borne, for his mercy endureth for euer: 11And Israell brought out from them, for his mercy endureth for euer. 12With mighty hand and stretched arme, for his mercy endureth for euer. 13Whiche cut the red sea in two partes, for his mercy endureth for euer, 14And Israell made passe there through, for his mercy endureth for euer. 15And drouned Pharao and his host, for his mercy endureth for euer: 16Through wildernes hys people led, for his mercy endureth for euer. 17He whiche did smite greate noble kinges, for his mercy endureth for euer: 18And whiche hath slayne the mighty kynges, for his mercy endureth for euer. 19As Sihon king of Amorites, for his mercy endureth for euer. 20And Og, the king of Basan land, for his mercy endureth for euer. 21And gaue their land for heritage, for his mercy endureth for euer: 22Euen to his seruant Israell, for his mercy endureth for euer, 23Remembred vs in base estate, for his mercy endureth for euer. 24And from oppressors rescued vs. for his mercy endureth for euer. 25Which geueth fode vnto all flesh, for his mercy endureth for euer. 26Praise ye the God of heauen aboue, for his mercy endureth for euer: 27Geue thankes vnto the Lorde of Lordes, for his mercy endureth for euer. Super flumina Babilonis. Psal. cxxxvii. VV.VV. The people of God in their banishment, seing Gods true religion decaye, lyued in greate anguish and sorow of harte, the whiche grief the Caldeons did so litle pitie, that they rather increased the same dayly, with tauntes, reproches and blasphemies againste God, wherfore the Israelites desire God to punish the Edomites who prouoked the Babilonians againste them, and moued (by the spirite of God) prophecy the destruction of Babilon, where they were handeled so tirannously [1] When as we sat in Babylon, y? riuers rounde about: and in rem?braunce of Sion the teares for grief burst out. [2]We h?gd our harps &amp; instruments, the willow trees vpon, for in that placemen for their vse, had planted many one. 3Then they to whom we prisoners were, sayde to vs tauntingly: Now let vs heare your Ebrue songes, and pleasant melody. 4Alas (sayd we) who can once frame, his sorowfull hart to syng: The prayses of our louing God, thus vnder a straunge kyng? 5But yet if I Ierusalem, out of my hart let slyde: Then let my fingers quyte forget, the warblyng harp to guyde. 6And let my tong within my mouth, betyde for euer fast: If that I ioy; before I see, thy full deliueraunce past. 7Therfore (O Lorde) remember now, the cursed noyse and cry: That Edoms sonnes againste vs made, when they razed our citie. Remember Lorde theyr cruell wordes, when as with one accorde. They cryed, on sack, and raze their wals, in despite of theyr Lorde. 8Euen so shalt thou (O Babilon) at length to dust be brought: And happy shall that man be calld, that our reuenge hath wrought. 9Yea blessed shall that man be calld, that taketh thy children yonge: To dash theyr bones against hard stones, whiche lye the streates amonge. Confitebor tibi. Psalme. Cxxxviii. N. Dauid with greate courage prayseth the goodnes of God toward hym, whiche is so greate, that it is knowne to forren prynces, who shall prayse the Lord together with hym. And he is assured to haue lyke comforte of God in the time folowyng, as he hathe had here to fore. Sing thys as the .cxlvii. Ps. Thee will I prayse with my whole hart, my Lorde my God alwayes: Euen in the presence of the Gods, I will aduaunce thy prayse. Towarde thy holy temple I will looke and worship thee: And praysed in my thankfull mouth, thy holy name shall be. Euen for thy louing kindnes sake, and for thy truth withall: For thou thy name hast by thy worde, auaunced ouer all. When I did call thou heardest me, and thou hast made also: The power of encreasced strength, within my soule to grow. Yea all the kynges on earth they shall, geue prayse to thee, O Lorde: For they of thy most holy mouth, haue hard the mightye word. They of the wayes of God the Lord, in singing shall entreate: Because the glory of the Lorde, it is exceding great. The Lorde is hye and yet he doth, beholde the lowly spirite: But he contemning knowes a farre: the proud and lofty wight. Although in middes of trouble I, doo walke, yet shall I stand: Renued by thee, O my Lord, thou wilt stretch out thy hand. vpon the wrath of all my foes, and saued shall I be: By thy right hand. The Lord God wil performe his worke to me. Thy mercy, Lorde, endures for ay, Lorde doo me not forsake: Forsake me not that am the work, whiche thine owne hand did make. Domine probasti. Psalme. cxxxix. N. Dauid to clense his harte from all hipocrisie sheweth that there is nothing so hye, whiche God seyth not, whiche he confirmeth by the creation of man. After declaryng his zeale and feare of God, he protesteth to be enemy to all them that contem God. O Lorde, thou hast me tryed and knowne, my sitting doste thou knew: And rysing eke, my thoughts a farre, thou vnderstandst also, My pathes, yea and my lying downe, thou compassest alwayes, And by familiar custome art, acquaynted with my wayes. No word is in my tong, O lorde, but knowne it is to thee, Thou me behinde holdst and before, thou layst thy hand on me. To wonderfull aboue my reache, Lorde is thy cunning skill: it is so hie that I the same, can not atteyne vntill. From sight of thy all seeyng sprite, Lorde whether shall I goo? Or whether shall I flee away, thy presence to scape froe? To heauen if I mount aloft, loe thou art present there: In hell if I lye downe by lowe, euen there thou dost appeare. Yea let me take the mornings winges, and let me goo and hide: Euen there where ar the farthest partes where flowing sea doth slide. Yea euen thether also shall, thy reaching hand me guide: And thy ryght hand shall holde me fast. and make me to abide. Yea if I say the darknes shall, yet shrowde me from thy sight: Loe euen also the darkest night, about me shalbe light. Yea darknes hideth not from thee, but night doth shine as day: To thee the darknes and the light, are bothe alike alway, For thou possessed hast my reynes, and thou hast couerd me: When I within my mothers wombe, enclosed was by thee. Thee will I prayse, made fearfully, and wondrously I am: Thy works are maruellous, right well my soule doth knowe the same. My bones, they are not hid from thee, although in secret place: I haue ben made and in the earth, beneth I shapen was. When I was formeles, then thyne eye, saw me far in thy boke: Were written all (nought was before) that after fashion toke. The thoughtes therfore of thee (O God) how dere are they to me? And of them all how passing great, the endles nombers be? If I should compt them, loe their summe more then the sand I see: And whensoeuer I awake, yet am I still with thee. The wicked and the blody men, of that thou woldest slaye: Euen those O God to whom, depart, depart from me, I say. Euen those of thee O lord my God, that speake full wickedlye: These that are lifted vp in vayne, beyng enemies to thee. Hate I not them that hate thee Lord? and not in earnest wise: Contende I Lorde against them all, against thee that arise? I hate them with vnfayned hate, euen as my vtter foes Trye me O God, and know my hart, my thoughtes proue and disclose. Consider Lorde if wickednes, in me there any be: And in the way, O God my guide, for euer leade thou me. Eripeme. Psalme. Cxl. N. Dauid complayneth of the crueltye, falshod, and iniuryes of his enemies against whiche he prayeth vnto the Lorde, and assureth him selfe of hys helpe and succoure. Wherfore he prouoketh the iuste to prayse thee and to assure them selues of hys tuicion. Lorde saue me from the euill man, and from the cruell wight: Deliuer me, whiche euell doo, imagine in their sprite. Whiche make on me continuall warre, their tonges loe they haue whet: Like serpents, vnderneth their lyppes, is adders poyson set. Kepe me, O Lorde from wicked handes, preserue me to a bide: Free from the cruell man that meanes, to cause my steppes to slide. The proud haue laid a snare for me, and they haue spred a net: With cordes, in my path way, and ginnes, for me eke haue they set. Therfore I said vnto the Lord, thou art my God alone: Here me O Lorde, oh heare the voyce, wherwith I pray and mone. O Lord my God thou only art, the strength that saueth me. My head in day of battell hath ben couerd still by thee. Let not O lorde the wicked haue, the end of his desire: Perform not his wicked thought lest they, with pride be set on fyre. Of them that compas me about, the chefest of them all: Lord let the mischef of their lippes, vpon them selues befall. Let coales fall on them, let him cast, them in consuming flame: And in depe pittes so as they may, not rise out of the same. For no backbiter shall on earth, beset in stable plight: And euill to destruction still, shall hunt the cruel wight, I know the lorde thafflicted will, reuenge and iudge the poore: The iust shall prayse thy name, iust shall dwell with thee euermore. Domine clamaui. Psalme. Cxli. N. Dauid being greuouslye persecuted vnder Saull, onely flieth vnto God to haue succour, desyring him to bridle his affections, that he may patiently abyde till God take vengeaunce of his enemies. O Lord vpon thee doo I cal, Lord hast thee vnto me, and herken Lord vnto my voyce, when I do crye to thee, as inscence let my praiyer be directed in thine eyes, &amp; the vplifting of my hands as euening sacrifice: My Lord for guiding of my mouth, set thou a watche before: And also of my mouing lipppes, O lorde kepe thou the dore. That I should wicked works commit, incline thou not my hart: With ill men, of their delicates, Lorde let me eate no parte: But let the righteous suite me Lorde, for that is good for me: Let him reproue me, and the same, a precious oyle shall be. Suche smiting shall not breake my hed. the time shall shortly fall: When I shall in their miserye, make prayers for them all. Then when in stony places downe, theyr iudges shalbe cast: Then shall they heare my words, for then, they haue a pleasant tast. Our bones about the graues mouth, loe scattred are they found As he that heaweth wod, or he that diggeth in the ground. But O my lorde my God, mine eyes, doo loke vp vnto thee: In thee is all my trust, let not my soule forsaken be. Whiche they haue layd to catch me in. Lorke kepe me from the snare: And from the suttle grennes of them, that wicked workers are. The wicked into their owne nets, together let them fall: While I doe by thy help escape, the danger of them all. Voce mea ad. Psalme. Cxlii. N. Dauid neither a stonied with feare, nor caryed awaye with anger, nor forsed by desperation, would kyll Saule but with a quyet mind, directed his earnest prayer vnto God who did preserue him. Before the lorde God with my voyce, did I send out my crye: And with my streamed voyce vnto, the lorde God prayed I. My meditation in his sight, to poure I did not spare, And in the presence of the Lorde. my trouble did declare. Although perplexed were my sprite, my pathe was knowne to thee: In way where I did walke a snare, they slyly layde for me I lookt and vewd on my ryght hand, but none there wold me knoo: All refuge fayled me and for, my soule none cared thoo. Then cryed I Lorde to thee, and sayde, my hope thou only art: Thou in the lande of lyuing art, my portion and my part. Harke to my crye for I am brought, full low: delyuer me. From them that doo me persecute. for me to strong they be. That I may prayse thy name my soule, from prison lord bringe oute: When thou art good to me, the iust, shall prese me round about. Domine exaudi. Psalme. Cxliii. N. An earnest prayer for remission of synnes, acknowledging that the enemies did cruelly persecute hym by Gods iust iudgment. He desireth to be restored to grace to be gouerned by his holy spirite, that he may spende the rest of hys lyfe in the true fere and seruice of God. Lorde heare my prayer, harke the playnte, That I doo make to thee: Lorde in thy natiue truthe and in, thy iustice aunswer me. In iugement with thy seruant, lorde, oh enter not at all: For iustyfyed be in thy syght, no one that lyueth shall. The enmie hath pursued my soule, my lyfe to ground hath throwne: And layde me in the darke like them, that dead are longe agone, Within me in perplexitie: was my accombred spryte, And in me was my troubled hart, amased and afflight. Yet I recorde time past, in all, thy workes I meditate: Yea in the workes I meditate, that thy handes haue create. To thee O lorde my God, loe I doo stretch my crauing hands: My soule desyreth after thee, as doo the thirstye landes. Heare me with spede, my sprite doth faile hide not thy face me froe: els shall I be like them that downe into the pit doo goe. Let me thy louing kindnes in, the morning heare and know, For in thee is my trust, shew me the way that I shall goe. For I lift vp my soule to thee, O Lorde deliuer me: From all mine enemies, for I haue hidden me with thee. Teache me to doo thy will, for thou thou art my God I say: Let thy good sprite vnto the land, of misery me conuey. with thy names sake with quickning grace a lyue doo thou me make: And out of trouble bring my soule, euen for thy iustice sake. And for thy mercy slay my foes, O lorde destroy them all: That doo oppres my soule for I thy seruaunt am and shall. Benedictus dominus. Psalme. cxliiii. N. Dauid prayseth the Lorde with greate affection, and humilitie for hys kyngdome restored, and for his victoryes obtayned, yet callyng for helpe, &amp; the destruction of the wicked promisyng to acknowleg the same with song of prayses, and declareth wherin the felicytie of anye people consisteth. Blest be the lorde my strength that doth instruct my hand to fight: The lord that doth my fingers frame, to battell by his might. He is my Goodnes fort and toure, deliuerer and shield: In him I trust my people he, subdues to me to yelde. O Lord what thing is man, that him, thou holdest so in price? Or son of man that vpon him, thou thinkest in such wyse. man is but like to vanitie. so pas hys dayes to ende: As fleting shade. Bow downe O Lorde thy heauens and descend. The mountains touche, &amp; they shal smoke cast fourth thy lightning flame, And scatter them, thine arrowes shote consume them with the same. Send downe thy hand euen from aboue O Lorde delyuer me: Take me from waters great, from hand of strangers make me free, Whose subtle mouth of vanitie, and fondnes doth entreate: And their right hand is a right hand, of falshod and deceit. A new song I will sing O God, and singing will I be. On viole and on instrument, tenstringed vnto thee. Euen he it is that only geues deliuerance to kynges, Unto hys seruaunt Dauid helpe, from hurt full sword he bringes: From strangers hand me saue and sheld, whoes mouth talkes vanitie: And their right hand is a ryght hand, of guile and sutteltye. That oure sonnes may be as the plants, whom growing youth doth reare: Our daughters as carued corner stones, lyke to a palace fayre, Our corners full, and plenty may, with sondry sortes be found, Our shepe bring thousands, in our strets ten thousands may abound, Our oxen be to labor strong, that none doo vs inuade: There be no going out, no crye, within our strets be made. The people blessed are that with such blessings are so stered: Yea blessed all the people are, whose God is, God the lorde. Exaltabo te deus. Psalme. Cxlv. N. This Psalme was made when the kingdome of Dauid florished. Wherein he describeth the wonderfull prouidence of God, as well in gouerning man as in preseruing al the rest of his creatures. He praiseth God for his iustice and mercie, but specially for hys louyng kindnes toward those that call vpon him, that feare hym and loue hym. Thee will I laude my God &amp; kyng, &amp; bles thy name for aye, for euer wil I prayse thy name and bless thee day by day, great is the Lord, most worthy praise, his greatnes not c? reach fr? race to race they shal thy works praise and thy power preache. I of thy gloryous maiestye, the beauty will recorde: And meditate vppon thy workes, most wonderfull, O Lorde. And they shal of thy power and of thy fearfull artes declare: And I to publish all abrode, thy greatnes will not spare: And they into the mention shall, breake of thy goodnes great: And I aloud thy righteousnes, in singing shall repete. The Lorde our God is gratious, and mercifull also: Of great abounding mercy and to angre he is slowe. Yea good to all, and all his workes, his mercy doth excede. Loe all thy workes doo praise thee lord, and doo their honor sprede. Thy sainctes doo bles thee and they doo thy kingdomes glorye shewe: And blase thy power to cause the sonnes of men his power to know. And of his mighty kingdome eke, to sprede the glorious prayse: Thy kingdome Lorde a kingdom is, that doth endure alwayes. And thy dominion through eche age, endures without decay: The Lorde vpholdeth them that fall, the sliding he doth stay. The eyes of all doo wayte on thee, thou doest them all releue: And thou to eche sufficing foode, in season due dost geue. Thou openest thy plentuous hand, and bounteously doest fill: All thinges what euer liue, with giftes of thy good will. The Lorde is iust in all his wayes, his workes are holy all: Nere all he is that call on him, in truthe that on him cal. He the desires whiche they require, that feare him will fulfill: And he will heare them when they crye, and saue them all he will. The Lorde preserues all those to him, that beare a louing hart: But he them all that wicked are, will vtterly subuert. My thankfull mouth shall gladly speake, the prayses of the Lorde, All flesh to prayse hys holy name, for euer shall accorde. Lauda anima mea. Psalm. cxlvi. I.H. Dauid shewing the great desire he had to prayse God, teacheth that none should put theyr trust in men, but in God alone: who is almightye and deliuereth thafflicted nourisheth the poore, setteth prisoners at lybertie, comforteth the fatherles, widowes, and the straungers, and raygneth kinge for euer. Sing thys as the .cxxxvii. [1] My soule prayse thou the Lord alwayes, My God I will confes: [2]Whyle death and lyfe prolong my dayes, my tonge no tyme shall cease. 3Trust not in worldly princes then, though they abound in wealth: Nor in the sonnes of mortall men, in whom there is no health. 4For why theyr breath doth sone depart to earth anone they fall: And then the counsels of their hart, decay and pearysh all. 5O happy is that man, I say, whom Iacobs God doth ayde: And he whose houe doth not decay, but on the lorde is stayd. 6Whiche made the earth &amp; waters depe, the heauens hie with all: Which doth his word and promise kepe In truth and euer shall. 7With right alwayes doth he procede, for suche as suffer wrong: The poore and hungry he doth fede, and lose the fetters strong. 8The lord doth send the blind their sight, the lame to limmes restore: The lorde, I saye, doth loue the ryght, and iust man euermore: 9He doth defend the fatherles, the strangers sad in hart. And quite the wydow from distres, and ill mens wayes subuert, 10Thy lorde and God eternally, O Syon still shall rayne: In tyme of all posteritie, for euer to remayne. Laudate dominum. Psalme. cxlvii. N. The Prophet prayseth the bountye, wisdom, power, iustice, &amp; prouidence of God vp? all his creatures. But specially vp? his church whiche he gathereth together after theyr dispersion. Declaring hys word and iudgm?ts so vnto them as he hath don to no other people. Praise ye the Lord, for it is good vnto our God to synge, For it is pleasante and to prayse, it is a comely thyng, the Lord his owne Ierusalem, he buildeth vp alone, and the disperst of Israell, doth gather into one. He heales the broken in their hart, theyr sore vp doth he bynde: He countes the number of the starres, and names them in theyr kynde. Great is our Lord great is his power, his wisdome infinite: The Lord releues the meke, &amp; throwes to ground the wicked wight. Sing vnto God the Lord with prayse, vnto the Lord reioyse: And to our God vpon the harp, aduaunce your singing voyce. He couers heauen with cloudes, and for the earth prepareth rayne: And on the mountaines he doth make, the grasse to grow agayne. He geues to beastes their fode, and to, yong rauens when they crye: His pleasure not in strength of horse, nor in mans legges doth lye, But all in those that feare the Lorde, the Lord hath his delight: And suche as doo attend vpon, his mercies shining light. O prayse thy Lorde Ierusalem, thy God O Syon prayse, For he the barres hath forged strong, where with thy gate he stayes. Thy children he hath blest in thee, and in thy borders he: Doth settle peace, and with the floure, of wheat he filleth thee. And his commaundement vpon, the earth he sendeth out: And eke his word with spedy course, doth swiftly runne about. He geueth snow like woll, hore frost, like ashes doth he spreade, Like morsells castes his ise, therof, the colde whoe can abide? He sendeth fourth his mightye worde, and melteth them agayne. His winde he makes to blow, and then, the waters flow amayne, The doctrine of his holy worde. to Iacob doth he shewe. His statutes and his iudgements he, geues Israell to knowe. With euery nation hath he not, so dealt, nor they haue knowne His secrete iudgementes, ye therfore, prayse ye the Lord alone. Laudate dominum. Psalme. cxlviii. I.P. He prouoketh all creatures to prayse the Lode in heauen, in earth, and in all places specially for the power that he hathe geuen to his people Israell, whom he hathe taken so nere vnto hym. [1] Geue laude vnto the Lord, fr? heauen, that is so hie: Praise him in dede and worde, Aboue the starry skie. 2And also ye his angels all, armies royall prayse him with glee. 3Praise him both mone and Sunne, Whiche are so cleare and bryght, The same in you be done, Ye glistring starres of lyght, 4And eke no les, Ye Heauens faire, 5And cloudes of the ayre, His laud expresse. 6For at his worde they were, All formed as we see: At his voyce did appeare, All thinges in their degree, Whiche he set fast, To them he made, A law and trade, For aye to laste, 7Extoll and prayse Gods name, In earth ye Dragons fell, All depe doo ye the same, For it becommeth you well. 8Him magnyfye, Fyre, Hayle, Ise, Snowe, And stormes that blow, At his decree. 9The hilles and mountaines all, And trees that frutfull are: The Cedres great and tall, His worthy prayse declare. 14Beastes and cattell, Yea birdes fliyng: And wormes crepyng, That on earth dwell. 11All kinges both more and les, With all their pompous trayne: Princes and all iudges, That in the worlde remayne, Exalte his name. 12Yong men and maides, Olde men and babes. Doo ye the same. 13For his name shall we proue, To be most excellent: Whose prayse is farre aboue, The earth and firmament. 14For sure he shall, Exalt with blisse, The horne of his: And helpe them all, His sainctes all shall forth tell. His prayse and worthines: The children of Israell, Eche one both more and les, 15And also they, That with good will, His wordes fulfyll, And him obey. Cantate dominum. Psalme. cxlix. N. An exhortation to the churche to prayse the Lorde for hys victorye and conquest, that he geueth his sainctes against all mans power. Sing ye vnto the Lorde our God, a new reioysing song: And let the prayse of him be heard, his holy sainctes among. Let Israell reioyse in him, that made him of nothing: And let the sede of Sion eke, be ioyfull in their king. Let them sound prayse with voyce of flut, vnto his holy name: And with the timbrell and the harpe, sing prayses of the same. For why the Lorde his pleasure all, hath in his peoyle set: And by deliuerance he will rayse, the meke to glory great. With glory and with honor now, let all the sainctes reioyse: And now aloude vpon their beds, aduaunce their singing voyce. And in their mouthes let be the actes, of God the mighty Lorde: And in their handes eke let them beare, a dooble edged sworde. To plage the Heathen and correct, the people with theyr handes, To bind their stately kinges in chaines their lordes in iron bandes. To execute on them the dome, that written is before: This honor all his sainctes shall haue, prayse ye the lorde therfore. Laudate dominum Psalme. CL. N. An exhortacion to prayse the Lorde without sease by all maner of wayes for all hys mightye, and wonderfull workes. Yelde vnto God the mightye Lorde, prayse in his sanctuarye: And prayse him in the firmament, that shewes his power on hie. Aduaunce hys name and prayse hym in, his mightye actes alwayes: According to his excellencye, of greatnes geue him praise, His prayses with the princely noyse, of sounding tropet blowe. Praise him vpon the viole and, vpon the harp also. Praise him with timbrell and with flute, orgaines and virginalles: With sounding cimbals praise ye him: praise him with loud cimballs. What euer hath the benefite, of breathing praise the lorde: To praise the name of God the lorde, agree with one accord. The ende of the Psalmes of Dauid in meter. The .x. Commaundements of almightie God. Exodus .xx. VV.VV. Attend my people &amp; geue eare, of ferly things I wil thee tel? Se that my words in mind thou bear, And to my precepts listen wel. 1I am thy Souerayne Lorde and God, Whiche haue thee brought from carefull thrall: And eke reclaymed from Pharos rod. Make thee no Gods on them to call. 2Nor facyoned forme of any thyng, In heauen, or earth to worship it: For I thy God by reuengyng, With greuous plages this syn will smite, 3Take not in vayne his holy name, Abuse it not after thy will: For so thou might soone purchase blame, And in his wrath he would thee spill. 4The Lorde from worke the seuenth day cest, And brought all thinges to perfect end: So thou and thyne that day take rest That to Gods hests ye may attend. 5Unto thy parents honor geue, As Gods commaundements doo pretende, That thou long dayes, and good maies liue, In earth, where God a place doth lende, 6Beware of muder, and cruell hate, 7All fylthy fornication feare: 8Se thou steale not in any rate, 9False witnes against no man beare, 10Thy neyghbors house wish not to haue His wyfe, or ought that he caleth mine, His field, his oxe, his asse, his sclaue, Or any thing, whiche is not thine. A prayer. The sprit of grace graunt vs (O Lord) To kepe these lawes, our harts restore: And cause vs all with one accorde, To magnifie thy name therfore. For of our selues no strength we haue, To kepe these lawes after thy will: Thy might therfore (O Christ) we craue, That we in thee may them fulfyll, Lorde for thy names sake, graunt vs thys Thou art our strength, oh Sauior Christ: Of thee to spede, how should we mis, In whom our treasure doth consist. To thee for euermore be prayse, With thy father in eche respect: And with thy holy sprite alwayes, The comforter of thine elect. The Lordes Prayer. D. Coxe. Our father which in heauen art, And makst vs all one brotherhod, to call vpon thee with one harte. Our heauenly Father &amp; our God: graunt we pray not with lips alone, but with the harts depe sigh and grone. Thy blessed name be sanctifyed, Thy holy worde mought vs inflame, In holy lyfe for to abyde, To magnifye thy holy name, From all errours defend and kepe, the little flock of thy poore shepe. Thy kyngdom come euen at this houre, And henceforth euerlastyngly: thine holy ghost into vs poure: With all his gifts most plenteously, From Sathans rage and filthy band, Defend vs with thy mighty hande. Thy will be donne with diligence, like as in heauen in earth also: In trouble graunt vs pacience, thee to obey in wealth and wo, let not flesh, bloud, or any ill, Preueile againste thy holy wyll, Geue vs this day our dayly bread, And all other good giftes of thyne: kepe vs from warre, and from bloudshed, Also from sicknes, derth and Pine, that we may liue in quietnes, Without all gredy carefulnes. Forgeue vs our offences all, Releue oure carefull conscience: As we forgeue bothe great and small, Which vnto vs haue done offence. Prepare vs lorde for to serue thee, In perfect loue and unitie. O lorde into temptacion, Leade vs not when the find doth rage: to withstande his inuasion: Geue power and strength to euery age, Arme and make strong thy feble host, With fayth and with thy holy ghost. O Lorde from euill delyuer vs, The dayes and times are daungerous, From euerlastyng deathe saue vs: And in our last nede comfort vs, A blessed ende to vs bequeath, Into thy hands our soules receyue. For thou (O Lorde) art king of kinges, And thou hast power ouer all, Thy glory shineth in all thinges: In the wide world vniuersall, Amen, Let it be done (O Lord) That we haue prayd with one accord. The .xii. Articles of the christian Faythe. All my belief, and confidedce, Is in the Lord of might, the father which al things hath made the day &amp; eke the night, the heau?s &amp; the firmament, and also many a star, the earth: and all that is therin, which passe m?s reason far. And in lyke maner I beleue, In Chryste oure Lorde, hys sonne: Coequall with the deitie, And man in flesh and bone. Conceyued by the holy Ghost, His word doth me assure: And of his mother Mary borne, Yet she a Uirgin pure. Because mankind to Sathan was, For sinne in bonde and thrall: He came and offred vp him selfe, To death to saue us vs all. And suffering most greuous paine: Then Pilate beyng iudge: Was crucifyed on the cros, And therat did not grudge. And so he dyed in the fleshe, But quickned in the sprite: His body then was buryed, As is our vse and ryte. His sprit did after this descend, Into the lower partes: To them that long in darknes were, The true lyght of theyr hartes. And in the third day of his death, He rose to lyfe agayne: To thende he might be gloryfyed, Out of oll grief and payne. Ascending to the heauens hie, To sit in glory styll: On Gods right hand, his Father dere, According to his will. Untill the day of iudgement come, When he shall come againe: With Angels power, yet of that day, We all be vncertayne, To iude all people rightuously, Whom he hath dearly bought: The lyuing and the dead also, Which he hath made of nought. And in the holy spirit of God, My fayth to satisfye: The third parson in Trinitie, Beleue I stedfastlye. The holy and catholick Churche, That Gods worde doth maintayne: And holy Scripture doth alowe, Which Sathan doth disdayne. And also I doo trust to haue, By Iesu Christ his death: Release and pardon of my sinnes, And that only by fayth. What time all flesh shall ryse agayne, Before the Lorde of might: And se him with theyr bodely eyes. Whiche now doo geue them light. And then shall Christe our sauior, The shepe and Goates deuide: And geue lyfe euerlastyngly, to those, whom he hath tride, Whiche is the realme celestiall, In glory for to rest: With all the holy company, Of Saincts and Angels blest, Whiche serue the Lorde omnipotent, Obediently eche houre: To whom be all dominion, And prayse for euermore. A Prayer vnto the holy ghost, to be song before the Sermon. Sing thys as the .cxix. Psal. Come holy sprite, the god of might, Comforter of vs all: Teach vs to knowe thy word a right that we doo neuer fall. O holy Ghost, visit our coast, defend vs with thy shild: Against all sinne and wickednes, Lorde helpe vs win the field. Lorde kepe our Quene and her counsell, and geue them will and might: To perseuer in thy Gospell, which can put sinne to flyght. O Lorde that geuest thy holy worde, send preachers plenteouslye: That in the same we may accorde, and therin lyue and dye. O holy Sprite, direct a ryght, the Preachers of thy worde: Thot thou by them maist cut downe syn, As it were with a sworde. Depart not from those pastors pure, but ayde them at all nede: Whiche breake to vs, the breade of lyfe, wheron our soules doo feede. O blessed spirit of truthe, kepe vs, In peace and vnitie: Kepe vs from sectes and errours all, And from all papistrie. Conuert all those, that are oure foes, and bryng them to thy lyght: That they and we, may well agree, and prayse thee day and nyght. O Lorde increase our fayth in vs, and loue so to abounde: That man and wyfe, be voyde of strife, and neyghbours about vs rounde. In oure tyme geue thy peace, O Lorde, to nations farre and nye: And teache them all thy holy worde, that we may syng to thee. All glory to the Trinitie, that is of mightes most: The lyuing Father and the Sonne, and eke the holy Ghost. As it hath bene in all the time, that hathe been here to fore: As it is now and so shalbe. henceforth for euermore. Da pacem domine. Geue peace in these our daies o lord, great daungers are now at hand, thine enemies with one accorde: Christ name in euery lande: seke to deface, route out and race: thy trew right worship in dede: be thou the stay, lord we the pray, thou helpest alone in all nede. Geue vs that peace: whiche we doo lack, Through misbelief and ill lyfe: Thy word to offer thou dost not slack, Whiche we vnkindly gain striue. With fire and sword, This healthfull word, Some persecute and opprisse: Some with the mouth. Confes the truth, Without sincere godlines, Geue peace, and vs thy spirite downe send, With grief and repentaunce true: Do pearce our harts, our liues to amend, And by fayth, Chryst renue. That feare and dread, Warre and bloudshed, Through thy swete mercy and grace: May from vs slyde, Thy truth may byde, And shine in euery place. The complaint of a Sinner who craueth of Christ, to be kept vnder hys mercye. Where rightuousnes doth say lord for my sinfull part: in wrath y? shouldst me pay v?gaunce for my desart. I can it not deny, but nedes I must confes, how y? continually thy lawes I doo transgres. Thy lawes I do transgresse. But if it be thy will, With sinners to contend Then all thy flock shall spill, And be lost without end. For who liueth here so right, That rightly he can say: He sinneth not in thy sight, Full oft and euery day. Thy scripture plaine telth me, The righteous man offendeth: Seuen times a day to thee, Wheron thy wrath dependth, So that the rightwise man, Doth walke in no such path: but he falth now or than, In daunger of thy wrath, Then since the case so standes, That euen the man rightwise: Falth oft in sinfull bandes, Wherby thy wrath may ryse. Lorde I that am vniust, And rightwisenes none haue: Wherto then shall I trust. My synfull soule to saue. But truly to that post, Wherto I cleaue and shall: Whiche is thy mercy most, Lorde let thy mercy fall. And mitigate thy mode, Or els we perish all: The pryce of this thy bloud, Wherin mercy I call. Thy scripture doth declare, No drop of bloud in thee: But that thou didst not spare, To shed eche drop for me. Now let those drops most swet, So moyst my hart so dry: That I with sinne replete, May liue and sinne may die. That being mortifyed, Thys synne of myne in me: I may be sanctifyed, By grace of thine in thee. So that I neuer fall, Into suche mortall sinne: That my foes infernall, Reioyse my death therin. But vouchesafe me to keep, From those infernall foes: And from that lake so depe, Wheras no mercy growes, And I shall sing the songes Confirmed with the iust: That vnto thee belonges, Whiche art mine only trust. Through perfecte repentaunce the sinner hath a sure trust in God that his sinnes shalbe washed away in Christes ?loud. O Lord in thee is al my trust, geue eare vnto my wofull cry: Refuse me not that am vniust: but bowing downe thy heau?ly eye, behold how I doo still lament: my sinnes wherin I do offende O Lord for them shall I be shent: Sith thee to playse I doo intend. No no, not so thy will is bent, To deale with sinners in thine ire. But when in hart they shall repent, Thou grauntst with sped their iust desire To thee therfore still shall I cry, to wash away my sinfull cryme: Thy bloud (O Lorde) is not yet drye, but that it may help me in time. Hast thee O Lorde, hast thee I say, To power on me the giftes of grace: That when this life must flit away, In heauen with thee I may haue place, Where thou dost reigne eternally, with God which once did downe the s?d Where angels sing continually, To thee be prayse world without end. A thankes geuing after the receyuyng of the Lordes Supper. Sing this as the .xxxvii. Psa. The Lorde be thanked for his gyftes, And mercy euermore: That he doth shew vnto his saynctes To him be laud therfore. Our tonges cannot so prayse the Lorde, As he doth right deserue: Our harts can not of hym so thynke, As he doth vs preserue. His benefites they be so great, To vs that be but sinne: That at our handes for recompence, There is no hope to winne. O sinfull flesh, that thou shouldest haue, Suche mercyes of the Lorde: Thou doest deserue, more worthely, Of him to be abhord. Nought els but sinne, and wretchednes, Doth rest within our heartes: And stubburnely against the Lorde, We dayly play oure partes. The sunne aboue in firmament, That is to vs a lyght: Doth shew it selfe more cleane and pure, Then we be in his sight. The heauens aboue and all therin, More holy are then we: They serue the Lorde in theyr estate, Eche one in his degree. They do not stryue for mastership, Nor slake theyr office set: But feare the Lorde and do his will, Hate is to them no let. Also the earth and all therin, Of God it is in awe: It doth obserue the formers wyll, By skilfull natures law. The sea and all that therin is, Doth bend, when God doth beck: The spirtes beneathe doo tremble all. And feare his wrathfull check. But we alas, for whom all these Were made them for to rule, Do not so know or loue the Lorde, As doth the Oxe or mule, A law he gaue for vs to know, What was his holy wyll: He would vs good, but we will not Auoyd the thing is ill. Not one of vs that seketh out The Lorde of lyfe to please: Nor to the thyng that might vs ioyne Our Christ and quiet ease, Thus we are all his enemyes, We can it not deny: And he agayne, of his good wyll, Would not that we should dye. Therfore when remedy was none, To bring vs vnto lyfe: The sonne of God, our flesh he toke, To mend our mortall stryfe: And all the law of God our Lorde, He did it full obey: And for our sinnes vpon the crosse, Hys bloud our dettes did pay. And that we should not yet forget, what good he to vs wrought: A signe he left our eyes to tell, That he our bodyes bought, In breade and wine here visible, Unto thyne eyes and tast, His mercyes great thou maist record, If that his spryte thou hast. As once the corne did liue and grow, And was cut downe with sith, And threshed out with many stripes, Out from his huske to dryue, And as the mill with violence Did teare it out so small, And made it lyke to earthly dust, Not sparing it at all. And as the ouen with fyre hot, Did close it vp in heat: And all this done that y? haue sayd, That it should be our meat: So was the Lorde in his ripe age Cut downe by cruell death: His soule he gaue in torments great, And yelded vp his breath. Because that he to vs might be, An euerlasting bread, With muche reproche and trouble great, On earth his lyfe he led. And as the grapes in pleasant tyme Are pressed very sore, And plucked downe when they be rype, Nor let to grow no more. Because the ioyse that in them is, As comfortable drynke, We myght receyue and ioyfull be, When sorowes make vs shrinke. So Christes bloud out pressed was, With nailes and eke with speare: The ioyse wherof doth saue all those, That rightly do him feare. And as the cornes by vnitie, Into one lofe is knit: So is the Lorde and his whole churche, Though he in heauen sit. As many grapes make but one wyne, So shoulde we be but one: In fayth and loue, in Chist aboue, And vnto Christ alone. Leading a lyfe without all stryfe, In quyet rest and peace, From enuye and from malyce both, Our heartes and tonges to cease. Which if we doo then shall we shew, That we his chosen be: By fayth in him to leade a lyfe, As alwayes willed he. And that we may so doo in dede, God send vs all his grace: Then after death we shall be sure, With him to haue a place. Robert Wisdom. [Preserue vs Lorde, by thy deare word] Preserue vs Lorde, by thy deare word, From Turk and Pope defend vs Lord whiche bothe would thrust oute of his throne, our Lorde Iesus Christ thy deare sonne. Lorde Iesus Christ shew forth thy myght, That thou art Lorde of Lordes by ryght: Thy poore afflicted flocke defend, That they may prayse thee without end, God holy Ghost, our comfortor, Be our Patron, helpe, and succor: Geue vs one minde, and perfect peace: All giftes of grace in vs encrease. Thou liuing God, in parsons three. Thy name be praysed in vnitie: In all our nede so vs defend: That we may prayse thee, world without end.</field>
