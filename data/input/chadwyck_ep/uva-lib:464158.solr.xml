      <field name="fulltext">The Preface. To euery ioynt, The finger point, In order as they stand: The letter then, To all those men, That take this book in hand. Then shall they knowe, And plainly showe, The Chapter out of dout: Of any thing, In this writing, The letter once found out. From A. to U. The thing is true, The Alphabet dooth last: Euen twentie iust, From last to first, So count you must to cast. If you once finde, The letter in minde, And knowe what number it is: You may be sure, Of that Scripture To hit and not to misse. But perfet must, You bee to trust, The letter and his somme: And then you may, Withouten nay, The story tel to come. Also the book, See that you look, How it is calld by name: And then the text, And number next, Be sure it is the same. Finis. In. G. Ex. L. N. and D, The five bookes of Moyses contayned bee. Genesis. The i. Chapiter. Almighty God did make the heauens and set therin these lightes The Sun, the Moon, &amp; all the starres appeering in our sightes. The earth, the Sea, and all therin, all these his woord did make: With man made last and yet set first, his wil on them to take. The ij. Chapiter. Begin did then the Lord to rest, From making of suche things And pointed Adam to a place. a garden ful of springs. One tree denied, and man dooth name the beastes after his wil: In sleep to him his make was made, whiche did his minde fulfil. The iij. Chapiter. Caused was man by Sathans sleight Gods wil to break outright: The hee, the shee, and the Serpent are curst and driuen out quite. For fear lest man should then dispair, with his wife and to hel: The womans seed y? whiche was Christe shall come and make all wel. The iiii. chapiter. Down fel Abel, Cain him slue, in offering to the Lord: The iust was slain of the vniust, as scripture dooth record. Then is he curst and dooth dispair, after his wicked deed: The genealogie of Adams sonnes, and their sonnes dooth proceed. The v. chapiter. Euery yeer that Adam liued, is there moste plainly tolde: Whose age was then euen nine hundred and ful thirtie yeer olde. And so from him vnto iust Noe, the chapter dooth expresse: The names &amp; yeeres how long they liued with muche of their successe. The vi. chapiter. Ful wicked were the people tho, a flud was threat of God: With a precept to make an ark, euen as the Lord had bod. And then did Noe prepare the ship, after the Lords deuise: And redy prest as he was wild against the flud should rise. The vii. chapiter. God spake these woords to Noe his m? and we therto must hark: Go thou and all thy familie, with speed into the ark. Euen so did Noe as God him bad, and took of eche kinde twain: His wife, his sonnes, and all their wiues, and then began the rain. The viii. chapiter. Hundreth dayes and od fiftie, the flud began to end: A Rauen and eke a Dooue also, Noe, foorth for newes did send. Then went Noe forthe and did offer, to God burnt sacrifice: Whiche liked wel the God on hie, when the smel did arise. The ix. chapiter. In fauour then was Noe and blest, and murther is denide: A rainbowe sent, and promise made with water not destroyd. Then Noe fel drunk and lay vnhilde, and Ham his sonne was glad: The other hilde him and were blest, But Ham ? is cursing had. The x. chapiter. Knowe ye may of Noe his sonnes, As Sem, Ham and Iapheth: Clius, Hams sonne begot Nemrod, a hunter on the heath. Of these three sonnes &amp; their s?nes s?nes the earth was storde again: In tungs &amp; kindes with realms &amp; lands, But moste of them were vain. The xi. chapiter. Lewdly forth went this rout to build, Babel that great hie toure The Lord came down &amp; cha?gd their tungs in lesse space then an houre. The kinde of Sem again is tolde, vnto iust Abraham: Whiche went with Lot his fathers sonne and dwelled at Haran. The xij. chapiter. Muche fauour God shewd to Abram. dwelling in Canaan: Whiche God him plight, then come a dearth, to Egipt went he than. Then willed he Sarai his wife, to call him brother tho: The king her took and was plaged, whose name hight Pharao. The xiij. chapiter. Neighbourlike yode Lot and hee, And toward the south they went: Then parted they their land and good that God had to them lent. The promise then to Abram is, repeated once again: That hee and his seed after him, the blest land should obtain. The xiiij. chapiter. Of foren kings Lot taken was, whiche ward and wan that land But then Abram did them destroy, and took him from their hand. Melchisedech with bread and wine, him met with mickle boste: He gaue him tenth and paid the king, of Sodome all he lost. The xv. chapiter. Performe would God the land he had, to Abram promised: A sonne to haue he dooth beleeue, and so is iustified. How that his seed in bondage should, in Egipt there remain: And be restorde vnto their land, and so sent home again. The xvi. chapiter. Quite barren Sara thought shee was and gaue Abram her maid: Whiche did conceiue and beeing proud her mistres did vpbraid. Her mistres chod, and shee to go, for faring with her fel: An Angel her returnd again, and plight her Ismael. The xvii. chapiter. Remooue did God then Abrams name, and calld him Abraham: And Sarai is named Sara, of whom tho Isaac came. The sacrament is heer begun of Circumcision: Isaac is plight, and Abraham for Ismael dooth mone. The xviii. chapiter. So vnto him three men apeerd, like trauaylers of miles: Sara did hear that shee should bear, and womanlike shee smiles. The ouerthrowe of Sodome then, to Abraham they tolde: He prayeth to them beeing one God, his vengeance to with holde. The xix. chapiter. Two Angels lodg'd, and Sodome men would then haue them defilde: Blinded they were and after stroyd, saue Lot and his vnfilde. His wife to salte was turned tho, for breaking Gods precept: His daughters he begat with childe when drunklike he had slept. The xx. chapiter. VVhen Abraham did flit he dwelt, In the land of Gerar: His wife was fair, he feard his life and called her sister. Abimeleck sent for her then, his plesure for to haue: God him denide and then the king, Muche riches to her gaue. The xxi. chapiter. Almightie God to Sara sent, Isaac her onely sonne: And Agar with her childe put out, no longer there to wonne. An Angel did her comfort tho, being in wildernes About a wel, Abimeleck and Abraham made peace. The xxij. chapiter. Being then wild, to kil his sonne, and hee therto was prest: God tolde him that for his great faith in him all should be blest. Nachor brother to Abraham, had eyght sonnes by Milcha: One of her sonnes was Bethuel, Father to Rebecca. The xxiij. chapiter. Commend to God, did Sara then her soule that was so milde: At her ful yeeres shee fel on sleep. and died vndefilde. Then Abram bought a plat of ground, of Ephron the Hethite: He layd his wife into the caue, when it was his by right. The xxiiij. chapiter. Decree did Abram to his man, and sware him by an othe: To seek a wife for Isaac meet and so he did for trothe. He went and came with Rebecca, whiche Isaac took to wife: So liued they together bothe, and led an honest life. The xxv. chapiter. Eftsoones did Abram take a wife, whiche bare him children more: He died and gaue Isaac his sonne his good and all his store. Then Isaacs wife euen at one birthe, Iacob and Esau bare: And Esau solde him land and right, And yet small was his fare. Thus haue you heard of Genesis, The pith and halfe the some: Twentie and fiue in chapters past, Sith that the first begun. The xxvi. chapiter. A death then came in Isaacks time, and so hee did remooue: That land was plight to him and his of God that did him loue. The king chod Isaac for his wife, because hee did but fain: And shepheards stroue about the welles, but all was wel again. The xxvii. chapiter. Begilde did Iacob Esau then, Rebecca wrought the feat: While Esau hunted in the feeld, his brother got the cheat. When Esau came from hunting home, it vexed him right sore: His father cheerd him, yet did hee his brother hate therfore. The xxviii. chapiter. Commaunded Iacob sought a wife and so to Laban went: Esau did wed an Ismaelite, whiche vnto euil was bent: As hee in sleep a Ladder saw, with Angels goodly dight: Of Christe is tolde a vow he made, vnto the God of might. The xxix. chapiter. Decree with Laban, Iacob did, and serued him seuen yeer: Rahel to haue it was his fee, but Lea did appeer. And so begil'd, yet did he serue asmuche for Rachel more: He hauing bothe foure babes he had, whiche Lea to him bore. The xx. chapiter. Eche of them bothe they gaue their maid to their husband to wiue: So had he children that they bare, they beeing stil aliue. And Iacob askt what his reward, should be at Labans hand: The spotted lambes and kids of goats, that fel in Labans land. The xxxi. chapiter. Flit then from Laban God him bad, and so he did obay: He took his wiues and all his good, and slily slipt away. Then Rachel stale the Images, against her fathers wil: And Laban chod, but peace was made, with Iacob on an hil. The xxxij. chapiter. Gods hoste he saw as he forth went, his brothers wrath he feard: And therfore sent him giftes before, euen hundreds on an heard. He with an Angel stroue so long, til day did end the night: The Angel chaunged Iacobs name, and Israel him hight. The xxxiij. chapiter. Hastely Esau set him out, his brother for to meet: And Iacob sent his herds afore, and came after on feet. But when they met they greed wel, God so did woork with them: In parting plotes they dwelt in two, as Iacob in Sichem. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Iacob no daughter had but one that Dina hight by name: Shee went to see and to be seen, and so shee came to shame. For Sichem did the damsel see, and forced her by might: He was destroyed by Iacobs sonnes, and all the citie quite. The xxxv. chapiter. Knowe wel did Iacob all their spite, to Bethel then he yed: His name is tolde, and Canaan is to him promised. In childe bed Rachel did depart, and Beniamin shee bore: Ruben vnhilde his fathers wife, and lost a fleese therfore. The xxxvi. chapiter. Likewise is tolde of Esaus wiues, and gentles daughters all: Hee and Iacob were very riche, in goods terrestriall. Esau had Dukes that were his sonnes, Euen twelue in number iust: He was father to Edomits, in whom God had no lust. The xxxvii. chapiter. More for to hear of Iacobs life, in Canaan he dwelt: Iosephs breethern liked him not, and cruelly they delt. Into Egipt then was he solde, his brethern wrought the deed: They tolde his sire his sonne was slain, whiche made his hart to bleed. The xxxviii chapiter. Now then is shown how Iuda took a wife of Canaan: He had three sonnes two were destroyd, the third was nam'd Onan. And Thamar was the womans name, whiche bothe of them did wed: And Iuda by her had two twinnes, when she was brought a bed. The xxxix. chapiter. O what an hap then Ioseph had, the Lord did so prouide: His masters wife did him prouoke, but he her sute denide, Shee him accus'de but not deseru'de her tale as then took place: Wherby Ioseph to prison went, but giltles in that cace. The xl. chapiter. Put in prison were Pharoes men, and bothe of them laid fast: His baker cheef, and butler bothe, whiles his anger did last. Ioseph with them in prison was, and as they slept ful sound: They dreamed dreames whiche vnto th? this Ioseph did expound. The xli. chapiter. Question askt of Pharoes dream, of Oxen fat and lean: Whiche Ioseph did expound ful plain and tolde what they did mean. He was set vp, and ruler made in Egipt ouer all: Two sonnes he had and so the dearth, on Egipt then did fall. The xlii. chapiter. Ride out for corne did Iosephs kin, and came to him vnknowne: He threat them hard that they were spies into that cuntrie blowne. Simion laid in prison is whiles they did home return: And Beniamin they took with them, whiche made their father mourn. The xliii. chapiter. So back they went to Egipt tho, with giftes and presentes great: And Simeon is deliuered out, and Iosephs cheeks are wet. And Ioseph could not then but weep, when Beniamin he saw: They sat and feasted in two parts according to their law. The xliiii. chapiter. Then Ioseph wrought a pretie cast, Beniamin for to haue: And theft he laid vnto his charge, suche woords to them he gaue. But Iuda suretie he became for Beniamin his sake: His father Iacob hee did knowe, it heuely to take. The xlv. chapiter. Unknowne was Ioseph all this while, at last he tolde them all: That he their brother Ioseph was, That ruled great and small. Then willed hee his brethern straight, their father for to fetche: In Egipt land to bide and dwel, as far as it did stretche. The xlvi. chapiter. Appointed foorth then Israel went, in Egipt for to bide: And God him bad nothing to fear, for all should wel betide. Iacob his sonnes and all their sonnes, is then in order tolde: And Ioseph went them all to meet, ful ioyful to beholde. The xlvij. chapiter. Brought was Israel before the king, in his presence to stand: And Pharao wild that he should dwel, where fattest was the land. Then Iacob sware Ioseph his sonne, euen vnderneath his thie: His bones to lay in Canaan, at time when he should die. The xlviij. chapiter. Causd was Israel sick to bee, by course of natures kinde: And Ioseph went with his two sonnes, to knowe his fathers minde. Iacob did wil that Iosephs sonnes, Ephraim and Manasses: Should be as children to him born, whiche Ioseph wel did please. The xlix. chapiter. Down fel his sonnes vpon their knees euen twelue of them there was: He blest them all and tolde of things that after came to passe. Then chargd he them that they should lay his bones in Manebrey feeld: Then pluckt he vp his legs to him, and vp the ghoste did yeeld. The l. chapiter. Eche th?g was doon, his corps they took as he on liue did minge: And laid it down by Abrahams side, fulfilling so eche thing. Forgiue did Ioseph all the fault, that his brethern had wrought: And so he dide and wild his bones, to his fathers to be brought. Heer haue ye now the end and some, of Moyses his first book: The second shall in order come, Suche pain the writer took. Exodus. The first Chapiter. And then the first of Exodus, the twelue tribes it dooth name: Whiche being dead &amp; laid in earth their children came to fame. A new king then to Egipt came, that gaue the midwiues charge: To kil the males when they were borne but they set them at large. The ii. chapiter. Born Moyses was and after cast, euen down the riuer in reeds: And Pharoes daughter took him vp and shewd him motherly deeds. Then Moyses slue an Egiptian, and fled and took a wife: The people cride vnto the Lord, whiche saw their woful life. The iii. chapiter. Caused was Moyses sheep to keep, not far from Oreb hil: Wherin a bushe the Lord appeerd, and tolde him all his wil. And bad him go to Egipt back, the Israelites to tel: That out of bondage they should come and liue and doo ful wel. The iiij. Chapiter. Declaerd by double signes it is, that calld he was by God: His reasons all they are assoild, and foorth the Lord him bad. As Aaron met with him in feeld, togither then they went: Of Iethro, Moyses took his leaue, and yod where he was sent. The v. Chapiter. Eche bothe of them with outen fear, tolde Pharao God his minde: The more the people were opprest, the king was so vnkinde. Then cride they out and gan to chide, with Moyses and Aaron: And Moyses axed God the cause, whiche looked them vpon. The vj. chapiter. Festfully was deliuerance, vnto the Israelites: Also the land of Canaan, whiche made them cheerful wightes Then Rubens spring with Simeon, is tolde and Leuy too: Of whom came Moyses and Aaron, that had Gods hestes to doo. The vii. chapiter. God made Moyses Pharoes God, and Aaron his Prophet: And then God turned Moyses rod, into a Serpent great, The sorcerers did euen the same, to harden Pharoes hart: Then were their waters turnd to blood yet did he not conuart. The viij. chapiter. Hit was Pharao, then and plagued, with Frogs ouer the land: He sent for Moyses and Aaron, to take the thing in hand. He mocked them, therfore the Lord turned their dust to lice: And they put by, then came there flies, after the Lords deuice. The ix. chapiter. Insteed thereof came moren of beastes that died in Pharoes land; And sixtly sores with botches great, yet did he God withstand. The seuenth was haile &amp; thunder mucht that made the land to shake: And lightning great from heuen on hie, whiche causd them all to quake. The x. Chapiter. Knowledge he yet would not his fault but God he did resist: He did it not in ignorance, but wel he knew and wist. The eyght plage next was grashopper that God almightie sent: The ninthe was darknes in the day, they knew not where they went. The xi. chapiter. Leaue then was giuen the Israelites, the Egiptians to spoil: Against they should depart and go, and giue them all a foil. At midnight then the Lord did vow, to make so great a slaughter: The first born of Egipt to kil, as it is tolde heer after. The xii. chapiter. Made heer is next the passeouer, and sweet bread for to eat: And if their children axt the cause, the meaning they must treat. The first born then destroyed are, and robbed were the rest: And so the Hebrues took their way, towards the land behest. The xiij. chapiter. Now all the first in Israels birth, the Lord did take and chuse: Commaunding them an yeerly feast, among them for to vse. Then passed they the wildernes, with Iosephs bones also: Two pillers for the day and night, they had therby to go. The xiiii. chapiter. Out Pharo went hard in his hart against the Israelites: So folowde he with all his train, and came within their sightes But God his people did defend, by night and day from harm: They past the sea but Egipt men, lay drowned in a swarm. The xv. chapiter. Past wh? they were this da?ger great they sang a goodly song: A woman came with diuers mo, and daunced all along. The bitter water was made sweet, and plesant for to drink: God must be heard in his couenant and on him must we think. The xvj. chapiter. Quainted when that they were two months within the wildernes: They wisht them selues again to be, in Egipt at their fleshe. It rayned Quailes from heauen on hie, and Manna for their bread: And fortie yeeres in wildernes, with that they were all fed. The xvij. chapiter. Remoouing on they lacked drink, and grudge then did the flock: At Moyses sute then had they some whiche came out of a rock. Foorth came a king hight Ameleck, against them for to fight: When Moyses hands were holden vp, then were they put to flight. The xviii. chapiter. So Iethro Moyses father in law, came Moyses for to see: Who welcomde him, his wife &amp; sonnes after the best degree. When Iethro saw what paines he took, when iudgement he did vse: Suche actiue men as loued not coin to help, he wild him chuse. The xix. chapiter. Then as they went they came vnto, the mount of Sinai: A royall people they are calld if Gods wil they apply. The Lord did say, he that dooth touche the hil, shall die outright: But Moyses wild, went vp to him in thunder and great light. The xx. chapiter. When he was come he gaue to him, ten iust commaundements: Precepts to keep and guide vs by with all their whole contents. An aulter of earth then God did bid, his man Moyses to make: And if of stone he did it build, no tool therto to take. Twentie chapters afore are tolde, in order as they stand: The rest heere after ye may read, if ye wil take in hand. The xxi. chapiter. And then this book, as it is calld, euen Exodus by name: Dooth tel good lawes for magistrates, to execute the same. That masters be not ouer sore, their seruants for to main: And he that kils a man is iudgd, for it he must be slain. The xxij. chapiter. Beholde you then these godly lawes of theft the fourth folde paid: He that defiles an vnplight lasse, he marry must the maid. A witche and he that knowes a beast bothe die they must of right: All vsury it is forbod, and hated in Gods sight. The xxiii. chapiter. Coupeling wise these chapters three, ronne all of ciuil lawes: Iudges are wild to take no gifts, but heere the poore mans cause. Thou maist not followe a multitude, wickednes to commit: Nor haue to doo with forren Gods, though thou shoulds die for it. The xxiiij. chapiter. Decree to Moyses God did then, and to the head rulers: To worship him the whiche dooth dwel, on hie aboue the starres. The law was tolde and all the rout, with voice therto obayes: So Moyses went vp to the mount, and bode there fortie dayes. The xxv. chapiter. Euen then to him did God describe the fashion of his place: His tabernacle how to build, in euery point and cace. He promised that in that house, with Moyses he would treat: Between the Cherubs in their place whiche was his mercy seat. The xxvi. &amp; xxvii. chapiter. Foorth on is tolde in these two next, chapters of Exodus: Whiche was declared to Moyses there as God did it discus. How that his holy place and house, whiche was his temple tho: Should be as he had it deuisde, wherby he might it knowe. The xxviii. chapiter. God did also to him describe, how Aaron should be clad: Suche garments might the people tel what office Aaron had. A brest lap and a tunicle, a strait cote vnder that: With other things that he must were, whether he stood or sat. The xxix. chapiter. How Aaron should a Preest be made, to him was reuelated: With all his sonnes after what sorte they should be consecrated. And God to him did promise then, that he would be their God: And they should knowe he had th? saued, from Pharao and his rod. The xxx. chapiter. Inioynd an aulter he must make, theron to burn incence: Also on it to reconcile, yeerly for their offence. A brasen lauer he must make, to washe and make all clean: The anointing oyl, with all the rest, more holy things did mean. The xxxi. chapiter. Knowledge two men th? had of God to woork the holy things: The Saboth eke and day of rest, God vnto Moyses minges. And Tables twain the Lord did giue, to Moyses on the hil: Wherin were writ the ten preceptes, whiche was th'almighties wil. The xxxii. chapiter. Like fooles a calfe was made there while the people were so vain: And Moyses praid to God for them, and burst the tables twain. When he came down he chod the preest, and burnt the calfe in fire: Moyses earnestly praid for them, yet some were paid their hire. The xxxiii. chapiter. Marche on forward God to them bad, that they should thense depart: But God denide to go with them, they were of froward hart. And when the people hard therof, they did lament in minde: Moyses willed to see Gods face, and saw him but behinde. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Now were the tables made again, and God his mercy plight: To cope with gentles or their Gods it is forbidden quite. The sweet bread feast is first begon, and Saboth day is tolde: The first frutes Moyses heard exprest, whose face did shine like golde. The xxxv. chapiter. Of diu?rs things to them is tolde that is afore exprest: To offer tithes and pay their frutes, eche one of them was prest. Bezaleel, Ahaliab, which wrought in silk and sayes: The tabernacle they must make, and Moyses dooth them praise. The xxxvi. chapiter. Plentie of things did these two make as God gaue them in gift: Kings of golde and curtens eke, to run all in a drift. The people brought suche store of stuffe, that there was ouer muche: Willing they were to build Gods house and for to make it riche. The xxxvii. chapiter. Quite all of wood the Ark was made, the mercy seat of golde: The tables and the candlesticks, were made of the same molde. Lamps like cups that stood on them, to burn and to giue light: The incence aulter it was made, according vnto right. The xxxviii. chapiter. Reard vp for offrings was the next, whiche should there on be burnt: A brasen lauer for to washe, muche like vnto a funt. Of Sicles thousands was the some, that of good wil they gaue: They sparde no cost to please the Lord, so he their soules might haue. The xxxix. chapiter. So Aarons garmentes they did make Appointed for the nones: Of costly golde and goodly silk, all set with pretious stones. So finishe then they did the woork, as God to Moyses wild: And he it blest and praisd it muche, when he the woork beheld. The xl. chapiter. Then last of all, almightie God, to Moyses tolde his minde: How he should set the holy things, in their order and kinde. The Lord did compasse with a cloud, the tabernacle quite: The presence of the Lord of hostes, was with it day and night. Thus Exodus is finished, iust fortie chapters all: Leuiticus comes next to it, whiche haue likewise ye shall. Leuiticus. The first Chapiter: Almightie God then Moyses tolde, within Leuiticus: How he should offer sacrifice, the Lord did it discus. Whether it were of beastes great, or els of cattel small: Of turtle dooues the maner how, they should be offerd all. The ii. chapiter. Baked in cakes and offering The manner them to trim: If leauen were put in therto, then should it not like him. Fine wheat flower and frankincense, must go vnto this feast: Salte must season eche sacrifice, where it be foule or beast. The iii. chapiter. Comely how that the offering, for peace it should be vsde: To make accorde where strife was had that hate might be refusde. Of Oxen, sheep, with lambes and gotes, attonement should be made: Leuiticus the third Chapter, dooth shew the forme and trade. The iiij. Chapiter. Default if that the preest had made and doon by ignorance: Should reconcile with sacrifice, confessing his mischaunce. And if a Lord did likewise so, offer he must likewise: The subiect for the same offense, must offer sacrifice. The v. chapiter. Eche one that sware &amp; not perfourmd they must confesse the deed: And offer a Gote or els a Lambe, vnlesse he be in need. The order how he should be clensd, that toucht an vnclean thing: The ignorant that sinned then, an offering must bring. The vj. chapiter. For him that stale or did deceiue, his neighbour willingly: Or found a thing and it denied, fiue folde restore should he, The dooers euil then offer should, for their offence and sin: An offring eke is tolde ful right, for Aaron and his kin. The vii. chapiter. Giue for their trespasse th? they must, likewise for sin and peace: The bakte and broilde, with fryed fleshe is theirs that it dooth dresse. The fat or blood may no man eat, it is denied plain: Of beast or foule where so it die, by chaunce or els be slain. The viii. chapiter. How Aaron should, lo heere is tolde, anointed preest, then be: And all his garmentes fit for him, then meet for his degree. And likewise for his sonnes therto, to minister also: With all their Albes and Tunicles, wherin that they should go. The ix. chapiter. In office Aaron offring made, for him and all the rest: And then the people out of hand, by Aaron were all blest. This likte so wel the God aboue, his glory did appeer: Consume he did the sacrifice, afore them all with fire. The x. chapiter. Knowe wel ye may that fier straunge was offred vp a new: And they were slain for their offence Nadab and Abihu: The preestes were then forbidden wine, to drink they were denide? But they might eat the sacrifice, if ought were left beside. The xi. chapiter. Leaue beastes must they that chue not cud nor wear their hoofes in twain: For man to eat for sustenance, they might not then be slain: Fishe lacking scale, or fin to swim, might not be eaten tho: Nor diuers foules, nor creeping beastes whiche on the earth dooth go. The xii. chapiter. Moyses receiued a law him giuen, for women that bare childe: Suche pain to them and to the like might teache them to be milde. Eight daies in house remain they should and then be purified: And offer giftes for sacrifice, suche as shee might abide. The xiii. chapiter. Notes for the Lepers had the preestes, to iudge them by their skin A white spot that is waxed black, a Lepre dooth begin: All other notes if ye wil knowe a Leper how to deem Let him then read the chapter all, whiche is of L. thirteen. The xiiii. chapiter. Of them when he must be receud, among the folke again: He must be clensd then of the preestes, by order written plain. And all the house that he was in, it must be clensd also: With searching had when it beginnes ere further that it go. The xv. chapiter. Pointed out is how men should be, clensed and purged clean: If they were staind by course vnkinde vnpurenes it dooth mean. For women also it dooth shew, that haue their birthright kinde: A sacrifice to purge them with, for them then was assignd. The xvj. chapiter. Quuickly is tolde then Aarons woork within the holy place: And how to clense the sanctuary, the maner and the cace. The feast of clensing then is tolde, how that it should be vsde: And all was doon as God them bad, and nought at all refusde. The xvii. chapiter. Requirde they were w?out the doores, their offrings to be slain: So was the Lord without the gates, whiche died for our pain. And God did them commaund they should not offer vnto deuils: Nor eat the blood nor carren meat, but keep them from suche euils. The xviii. chapiter. So then the ten and eyght dooth tel, what kinreds are forbod: To mary spouse in wedlock rate, whiche are denide of God. But chargd they are to keep and saue, the Lord his hestes and wil: And quite to flee from gentils trade whiche all together are il. The xix chapiter. Tolde then is eke the ten precepts, in ten and nine of L: Let euery man that looues the woord, giue ear what they doo tel. To steal or lie, or false to deale, or iudge in matters wrong: Nor man to wear a womans coat, where it be short or long. The xx. chapiter. Unto the Gods y? whiche were str?ge their seed they might not giue: Who that did so should feel this wo, among them not to liue. And those that woork by sorcery, thou may not to them trust: And certain kinreds are forbod, in whiche not cope thou must. The xxi. chapiter. And if that one did hence depart, the preest might not be by: Nor yet be shauen on head nor chin, for God did it deny. Also their wiues they must be maids, their daughters liuing chaste: Mishapen men may be no preestes of holy things to taste. The xxii. chapiter. Bear in minde those that might not, eat of the sacrifice: Almightie God tho in his law, shewes then who he denies. The maner how, that they should doo, when they to offer went: All this was doon to keep them back, from dooing their intent. The xxiii. chapiter. Commaund did God the Saboth day, and Easter to be vsde: The first frutes feast, and Whitsontide, it might not be refusde. The feast of clensing also must, be kept in order right: With other feastes that ther are mingd, as Moyses them did write. The xxiiii. chapiter. Decreed was then that lamps should be and oyle in them light: With shew bread set vpon a boorde, eche saboth in their sight. The childe that curst and did blaspheme was stoned vnto death: And he that kils a man must die, as God almightie saith. The xxv. chapiter. Eche seuen yeer tho the saboth yeer must solemnly be kept No vine was cut, for that whole yeer nor corn yet sowne or rept. The first yeer were the bandmen free, and lands restorde again: All vsury it is forbod, by woords that are ful plain. The xxvi chapiter. Forbid did God all Images, by woords moste plainly tolde: To them to kneel he dooth deny, a man to be so bolde. God wil defend his people all, that wil his woord obay: But they whiche not regard his wil their councels shall decay. The xxvii. chapiter. God tolde how vowes should prised be woman were it or man: And for the tithes that should be paid, whiche were apointed than. All these commaundementes afore, were giuen in mount Sinai: With charges great them to obserue, from God the almightie. Leuiticus is past and gone, twentie and seauen in all: And Numeri ye shall haue next, the fourth book we it call. Numeri. The first Chapiter: Apt vnto battail those that were from twentie yeeres and more, Are pointed out of all the tribes, saue Leuy kept in store. Whiche tribe the Lord did take &amp; chuse, to minister his wil: Suche holy things as he had wild, they must them all fulfil. The ii. chapiter. Build vp y? tentes how that they should was tolde vnto them tho: The tabernacle round about, eche tribe his tent to knowe. The heads and rulers of the hostes, are named in their kinde: The Leuites serued in the mids, as God had them assignde The iii. chapiter. Chuse out to battail might they not, the Leuites in their tribe: For the first born the Lord them took, and so set them on side. To minister his holy things, within the holy place: And next therto to build their shrouds, they must in any cace. The iiii. chapiter. Decree did God what they should doo their offices he tolde: And further then he pointed them, they not to be so bolde. Eche one after his stock and kinde, ful decently was set: And euery one to keep his course, with outen stay or let. The v. chapiter. Eche issue, and the Lazar man, might not among them dwel: For wrongs then doon, fiue folde restord the law did them compel. From company that was suspect, to keep mens wiues in awe: There was set out of ielousie, a good decree and law. The vi. chapiter. For suche as then did vow the vow, of perfet abstinence: The Lord almight their fare did point to keep them from offence. And also shewd to Moyses then, the maner how Aaron: Should blesse the flock, saying the Lord, blesse and keep you eche one. The vii. chapiter. Giftes were giuen then of the Lords, and heads of Israel: Among them all there one was hight, by name Nathaniel. Great were the giftes that they did giue they spared for no cost: In setting foorth Gods seruice right, they might with all men boste. The viii. chapiter. How that the Lord would haue the lamps to Moyses he did showe: The candlesticks in order fit, where they were hie or lowe. For clensing offring must be had, the Leuites they must vse: Whiche when they came to fiftie yeeres offring they might not vse: The ix. chapiter. Iustly y? time to keep their paske, to Moyses it was tolde: And how the filde or foren man, to offer might be bolde. He that denied to offer tho, he must be made to die: Bothe night and day a guide they had a cloud and light from hie. The x. chapiter. Knowledge suche had the people the, by trumpets that were blowne: Were it in warres or time of peace the sound to them was knowne. From Sinai they did depart, their captaines numbred all: And Iethro would not flit with them, betide what might befall. The xi. chapiter. Like fooles the people did complain, and plagde they were with fire With Manna cloyd, to Egipt back for fleshe was their desire. Moyses then did greeue the Lord, whose burthen he did ease: On Quailes they fed and kild they were for God they did displease. The xii. chapiter. Miriam then did grudge and swel, at Moyses God his iudge: And Aaron did consent therto, And so they bothe did grudge. With leprosie was Miriam stroke, to teache her to rebel: At Moyses prayer she was restorde, and liued, and did ful wel. The xiii. chapiter. Notes to take of Canaan, twelue men were thither sent: To see the fatnes of the land, therfore afore they went. Whiche came &amp; tolde how riche it was, with grapes a cluster great: They tolde of Cities great and strong whiche made them chase and freat. The xiiii. chapiter. Opinion had the people then, that land not to obtain: And grudge they did against the Lord whiche would straight them haue slain Not one of all the Israelites, the hest land did possesse: Saue Iosue and Caleb bothe, whiche two the Lord did blesse. The xv. chapiter. Prescribe did God a sacrifice, for sinnes of ignorance: But die they should that wilfully, did sin by arogance. Stonde he was that gathered sticks, vpon the Sabbothe day: Their garmentes garded round about, Gods hestes for to obay. The xvi. chapiter. Quarels picked certain that time, and Chorath was the one: Also Dathan and Abiron, the fourth made vp of On. These did rebel against their heads, And mooued God to ire: He causd the earth to swallowe them, and burnt the rest with fire. The xvii. chapiter. Receiue a token of their euil, immediatly they did: Twelue rods were brought from all the heads as God him self did bid. Among them all then Aarons rod, did floorishe foorth with buddes: To teache them way the prechers then for loosing of their bloods. The xviii. chapiter. Suche things as Leuites then did vse, did God almightie point: They were his preestes to serue his wil, whom Aaron did anoint. To whom the tithes &amp; frutes were paid, to maintain their degree: And Aaron had an heritage, as ye may read and see. Eyghteen Chapters now heere are past, of Numeri by name: And eyghteen more ye shall haue next, I trust in right good frame. The xix. chapiter. A red cow then was bid to kil, by Eliazer the preest: To sparge her blood and burn her quite as he ful wel it wist. A law to keep the people clean, from filthines or spot. No man to touche the holy place, but he that was his lot. The xx. chapiter. Begin did Israel for to grudge, they lacked drink to drink Out of a rock there gusht a stream, that fild them to the brink. The Edomites would not let passe, the people through their land: Then Aaron dide, and in his roum, Eleazar did stand. The xxi. chapiter. Captain Arad then came to fight, and lost his Cittie and life: Immediatly when they were come, euen from the waters strife. Then stung they were by serpentes great and heald by one on hie: They kild two kings Schon and Og, as Israel passed by. The xxii. chapiter. Deuise did Balack for to curse, the Israelites to hel: And sent for Balam in his fume, his cursing for to tel. He once denide and yet he went, his minde was set on gain: He smote his Asse and shee denide, his labour was in vain. The xxiii. chapiter. Euen as Balack had then decreed, so went he vp on hie: And Balam talkt with God a while, and spake thus by and by. How shall I curse or els defie. whom God dooth nothing so? And them he blest and blest again, or euer he did go. The xxiiij. chapiter. Foorthe went Balam in parables, declaring Israels hap: And Balack angry with the thing, his hands in one did clap. When he had said then Balam tolde. of Christes kingdome plain: A Star and scepter vp shall rise, in Iacob for to raign. The xxv. chapiter. Gods people then did slip away, and whordome did commit The Moabits in their seruice, hadtiste them vnto it. Then God c?maunded Moyses straight. to hang the rulers all: As two were dooing of the deed, Phinehes on them did fall. The xxvi. chapiter. How many were the Israelites, that Canaan should possesse: The whole xij. tribes are numbred all, whom God did chuse and blesse. He wild the land for to be delt, by partes in forme equal: The mo the more, the few the lesse so that no one haue all. The xxvii. chapiter. In presence then came certain maids inheritance to craue: Euen so they had as next of blood, successiuely must haue. The land behest to Moyses shewd, and tolde he is to die: His prayer is heard and Iesue set, his roum for to supply. The xxviii. chapiter Knowledge is giuen for euery day, what offring they must vse: A Lamb at morn and eke at euen, vnspotted they must chuse. The paske how that it should be kept, the day is pointed out: With all the order of the feast, to put them out of dout. The xxix. chapiter. Like sacrifice as God did point, this chapter dooth expresse: And telles how all their meates &amp; drinks in order they must dresse. Eight dayes at once they must not ceace to offer sacrifice: And woork no kinde of woork in them as God did them deuise. The xxx. chapiter. Men that vowed or sware an othe, with promise to the Lord: Must stand to it and not go back, the scripture dooth accord. But maid or wife that did the same, without their heds consent: They must go back if he denide, for all their good intent. The xxxi. chapiter. Next then to that went Israel foorth, the Madianites to kil: And slue the males &amp; burnt their townes and led the rest at wil. The spoile was delt foorth equally, the captaines were so good: Saue certain things were giuen to God for sauing of their blood. The xxxii. chapiter. Ouer Iordane towards the East, possession out was set: For two whole tribes and halfe a one so that they would not let. To go before their brethern all, in harnes freshe and bright: Against the land of Canaan, to put them all to flight. The xxxiii. chapiter. Perfourm did Moyses Gods precept Their iourneis he did write: From place to place in wildernes, and telles where they did light Then God did bid that they should kil, the Cananites out right: And ding their chappels all adown and burst their Idols quite. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Quietly how they should possesse, the land is tolde them plain: The east, the west, the north, the south, where they should rule and reign. Who should point out the land by lots, the Lord did Moyses tel: The heds should set out eche mans part where he should bide and dwel. The xxxv. chapiter. Resight did God the Leuits lots the suburbs and their townes: For refuge certain Citties set, to keep them in their boundes: He that with wil a man did kil, he must of right be slain: One witnes may in no wise stand, vnles that they be twain. The xxxvi. chapiter. Supplication then was made, for maids that were vnwed: Within their tribe then must they take, their husband and their hed. Euery tribe within his tribe, must wed and take his wife. Not one to mixe in others part, for fear of bate and strife. Now Numeri hath thus his end, the fourth book it is set: The fift in order ye shall haue, If God giue vs no let. Deuteronomium. The first Chapiter. A rehersall first heer is made, of things that were begun: From Oreb hil, to Cades barn, The acts that God had doon. The charge that Moyses Iudges gaue let rulers hear the same: If they intend the Lord to please and void rebuke and shame. The ii. chapiter. Begun as Moyses had tofore, so foorth he dooth proceed: From Cades barn vntil they came, withouten fear or dreed. And fought against Schon the king, whiche Hesbon did possesse: He was destroyd, and all his land was taken more and lesse. The iii. chapiter. Cast down were all the Ammonites, by Israels mightie hand: Likewise was Og of Basan King not able to withstand. Iosue chosen captain was, to stand in Moyses steed: And Moyses bad him to be bolde, and doo as God should bid. The iiij. chapiter. Decreed lawes by God almight to Moyses did he tel: Whiche if they would attend vnto, then should they doo ful wel. From thence to take ne ad therto, nor Images to rear: Three Citties pointed for refuge all this appeereth there. The v. Chapiter. Euery law that God did make, for people to obay: Is closde within the ten preceptes whiche there read all ye may. For Images yet once again, renued is the charge: And if they heed the Lord his hestes the land is theirs at large. The vi. chapiter. Folowe they must the Lord his wil, euen earnestly with might: Upon their doores and postes also, they must them plainly write. Not only so but also teache, their children they are bod: The Lords preceptes both all and some that they may knowe their God. The vii. chapiter. God did forbid a league to make, with gentiles in no wise: They must destroy their Idols quite, and all their Gods dispise. He also saith that he wil blesse, the keepers of his wil: And curse the rest and charge he gaue, Idolatrers to kil. The viii. chapiter. How maruaylously that God had delt, with Israel fortie yeer: In wildernes with benefits, as plainly dooth appeere. They are commaunded not to say their might did them defend: But that the Lord did bring them foorth, and gaue their foes their end. The ix. chapiter. In any cace they are forbod, to trust in their owne strength: For who so dooth him wil betide, a faule to haue at length. Moyses then a rehearsall made, ful breefly in a sum: From time they had receiude the law til they to lust begun. The x. Chapiter. Knowe heer ye may of Israels walke, whiles they in iourney went: And how the tables were renued, when they were broke and rent. Nothing the Lord did then require for dooing them suche good: But that they holde all his preceptes and set theron their mood. The xi. chapiter. Loue they must now y? Lord his law stil Moyses gaue them charge With hart &amp; minde they must him serue, that had set them at large. To talke therof when that they rise or at their sitting down: Or els in iourney as they walke in feeld be it or town. The xii. chapiter. Moyses once more so gaue them charge against Idolatrie: It to suppresse and put it down, and from the same to flee: And blood to eat they are forbod, in any manner wise: And onely doo as God them bad, and not what like their eyes. The xiii. chapiter. No Prophet false must bide on liue, but must be made to die: And wicked folke must not be heard, though in thy brest they lie. God for to trie the Israelites, how strong they were in faith Would suffer things to prooue them with as Moyses plainly saith. The xiiij. chapiter. Omit they must the Gentiles trades, and flee their dooings quite: And onely serue almightie God, with all their main and might: Suche beastes as they might not then eat are manifestly tolde: And whiche were clean is there exprest that eat they might be bolde. The xv. chapiter. Pardon their dets then are they bod at euery seuenth yeers end: When God his wil is serued and kept no scarsenes he wil send. Those that wil lend to suche as need, the maner is tolde how Deformitie in sacrifice, the Lord dooth not alow. The xvi. chapiter. Quietly how to keep their feastes the times are tolde them plain: When that they should be vsde and kept is written once again. O that Iudges would mark and read, and doo as God there bad: To take no giftes in any cace, but iustice to be had. The xvii. chapiter. Rewarded must Idolaters, with death by law to die: And doutful things must be referd to those that be on hie. Presumptuous men that doo rebel, must die the law dooth minge: The man and state that he must keep that they would take to king. Halfe this book is now tolde afore, in seauenteen chapters iust: And seauenteen more ye shall haue next, in God put we our trust. The xviij. chapiter. All the Leuites the whiche were preestes, might no possessions haue: All sorcery they must auoid, their liues to keep and saue. Moyses tolde then of Christe to come, and bad them him to hear: The Prophet false they must not way, nor all his dooings fear. The xix. chapiter. Because that murther might be dooth, against the dooers minde: For refuge, Citties were set out, and there vnto assignd. The false witnes must haue the stone, return to his owne brow: An eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, the law did them alow. The xx. chapiter. Chuse out for warres what men they should this chapter dooth expresse: The law of armes to them is tolde, to vse in war or peace. The Cananites, the Pheresites, the Iebusites also: With Heuites eke they must destroy not letting one to go. The xxj. chapiter. Decree did God a goodly law, for him that was found dead: And how the Iew should him behaue, a gentile for to wed. The first borne sonne he must possesse, the heritage and land: The childe that parentes dooth not fear, must die euen out of hand. The xxii. chapiter. Eche man must help his neighbours Asse although he be vnknowne: The man denied the womans tire, shee to go in her owne. Linste wolste might not be worn, the adulterer must die: And order taken for that man, that with a maid did lie. The xxiii. chapiter. Forbidden was the gelded man in Christes churche to dwel: The harlots bird dooth God commaund, that they should quite expel. There might no whore among th? bide, the Lord did so decree: The lone of things is there denide, so lend on vsury. The xxiiii. chapiter. Giue leaue did Moyses to deuorce, for causes that were light: The newly spousd they might not force in battaile for to fight. For money lent and seruantes hire, a goodly lesson tolde: Some leysing left in feeld and town, for poore folke yung and olde. The xxv. chapiter. How many stripes the trespasser, should haue for wicked life: A man that died without a sonne, his brother should wed his wife: That weightes &amp; mesures should be iust, read ye the chapters end: Who so dooth vse the contrary, shall come to wicked end. The xxvi. chapiter. Iustly must they now pay their frutes, that first to them did fall The tithes they were commaunded to, they should then pay them all, Unto the preestes, the fatherles, the straunger and widowe: Such goods were then the poores of right how so they vse them now. The xxvii. Chapiter. Knowledge was had the people then an aulter vp to rear: Afore that Iordane they did passe, or came the land so neer. The curses then that Leuy was commaunded for to speak: Against all those that did delight, Gods wil to burst or break. The xxviii. Chapiter. Louingly the Lord did blesse, the keepers of his wil: To stablishe them in their good mindes to keep them in it stil. And curse dooth hee the contrary, with cursings very great: Those that him looue he dooth them blesse his haters hee dooth threat. The xxix. chapiter. Moyses then went and thus he spake, vnto the people all: Saying to suche as feareth God, the Lord defends them all. But they that not regard his wil, suche plagues on them shall come: As like hath not been seen on earth, from rising of the sonne. The xxx. chapiter. Not far from them that doo it seek is Gods almightie woord: Those that it loue and it obay, are saued from the swoord. Within our mouthes and in our hartes the woord is alway prest: Those that it keep are sure at length, for it they shalbe blest. The xxxi. chapiter. Olde was Moyses and so did chuse, then Iosue in his steed: To whom he said see thou be strong, and haue no fear or dread. This book he wrote and did it giue, into the Leuites hand: And chargde that they the same should read, when they came to the land. The xxxii. chapiter. Plesantly then did Moyses sing a goodly long of praise: Unto the Lord for all the acts, that he had wrought alwaies, And vp he went vnto a hil, to look on Canaan: God had him there to run the race, that all his fathers ran. The xxxiii. chapiter. Quietly Moyses did prepare, to sleep his fathers sleep But this he said before he went, that God his saints dooth keep. Also he blessed all the tribes, afore his dying day: And tolde how they should rule &amp; reign, if they did God obay. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Rest from his woork did Moyses then and so gaue vp the ghoste: At his departing they did weep euen throughout all the hoste. And Iosue did his roum possesse as Moyses had it wild: And ruled all the Israelites, in Cittie and in feeld. Of Moyses books heer is the last, as he did them all write: Vnto the Lord giue ye the praise, whiche is the God of might. Iosue. The j. Chapiter. As God afore had Moyses calld his people for to guide: So Iosue to supply his room, the Lord set him on side. For to be strong the Lord him bad, and manly for to fight: And from the lawes of God the Lord, to turn to left nor right. The ii. chapiter. Before were serchers sent to spie, to Ierico they yede: A harlots house they lodged in, by whom then they were hid. Shee made them promise her to saue when spoild should be the land: And they agreed to knowe her house, by purple cord or band. The iii. chapiter. Care to Iosua did belong, the people for to guide: Remooue he did from Settim ground, and came to Iordane side: Then was the Lord disposde to shew, the honour of his name. He caused Iordain waters yeeld, and part a sunder twain. The iiij. Chapiter. Decree did God that his good woork should not be out of minde: And causd eche tribe to rear a stone, as monumentes behinde. And if their children axt the cause, why these twelue stones stood there: Then should they tel what God had doon to make his name appeere. The v. chapiter. Eche one of all the Cananites, were fraid when they hard tel How Iordane brook did part in two, whiles ouer went Israel. Then God commaunded Iosue, to circumcise them all: And all the males w? sharp stone kniues, were cut bothe great and small. The vj. chapiter. Fearful then were the Cananites, of Israels power and might: At seauen dayes end as God had said, the walles did fall down quite. Consumde was all with swoord and fire, saue vessels few reserude: And Rahab saued with all her kin, whiche wel shee had deserude. The vii. chapiter. God then was angry with his flock, at Ai took they the foile: Because that Acan Carmies sonne, had borne away some spoile. A garment gay with siluer muche, a rung of golde therto: Because it was forbid of God, he had death with stones enow. The viii. chapiter. Haue you no fear said God but go and fight against Ai: Thou shalt it take and haue some spoile, and all the rest destroy. So Iosue went as God him bad, and fought, but fled a while: The rest did set the town on fire, so them they did begile: The ix. chapiter. Immediatly the Cananites, with all the heathen Kinges: They came to fight as soon as they, of Iosua had tidings. The Gabanites dissembling partes with Israel they did play: Because the heads had sworne to them, they were not made away. The x. chapiter. Kings that were in number fiue with Israel they did fight: At Gabaon siege with all their hostes there were they put to flight. The Sun stood stil a whole day length and haile did beat them down: Fiue kings were slain and hanged vp, so wan they town by town. The xi. chapiter. Like hap had all the other kings, and sudainly were slain: And Hezor burnt and none but it that stood aboue the plain. Not one woord then was left vndoon as Moyses had him wild: But Iosua did fulfil it all, were hee in town or field. The xii. chapiter. Many battails Israel fought, ere Iordane they did passe: To two whole tribes, and halfe a one, their land appointed was. The kings are tolde and numbred all, that Iosua did subdue. Thirtie and one in number iust, whom they bothe took and slue, The xiii. chapiter. Note out the land as Iosua wild, by lots it to deuide: He beeing agde so god him bad, to set and point eche tribe. Ruben and Gad, and halfe the tribe, of Manasses by name: Were pointed plats for to posses, by Moyses set in frame. The xiiij. chapiter. Of Iosua Caleb did require, the Cittie Hebron walld: Whiche was possest by Enakes kinde a Giant was he calld. Foure score yeeres and fiue he was, when he requirde his ground: And yet he said he was as strong, as when the land he found. The xv. chapiter. Pointed out was Iuda his lot, the Citties tolde ful straight: The villages not named out, but townes fiue score and eight. For killing of a Giant great, a man did mary a wife: The Iebusites among the folke, did stil lead on their life. The xvj. chapiter. Quickly Ephraim so had his lot in length and bredth assignde: Euen as a tribe he had his part, according to his minde. And tribute paid the Cananites, and with them did they dwel: Although the Lord had said afore, that they should them expel. The xvii. chapiter. Right as afore that Ephraim, had out his part of land: Euen so Manasses had his lot, where he and his should stand, And certain women had likewise, as they did it require: And Iosephs house would haue more land but had not their desire The xviii. chapiter. Seuen tribes agreed to send their spies as Iosue had them wild: Of eche tribe three went foorth to see, the Citties and the feeld. And in a book in seuen partes writ to Iosua brought they woord: And he apointed them their plats, by lots afore the Lord. The xix. chapiter. To Zabulon and Izachar, and Aser beeing tenth: To Nepthali and Dan the last, was pointed bredthe and length. So Iosua with Eleaser, and all the Lords and heds: Did make an end of casting lots, and pointing out their stedes. The xx. chapiter. When they had doon and cast their lots then God to Iosue said: For him that killes a man vnwares, point Citties for their aid. And they therin to dwel and liue, til the hie preest dooth die: The swoord of blood not him to touche, if thyther he doo flee. The xxj. chapiter. And then the heads of the Leuites, their porcion did require: And so they had their whole request euen as they did desire. Fortie and eyght in Citties iust, their whole tale came therto So God them gaue the land and rest, as he them plight to doo. The xxii. chapiter. Bothe of the tribes and eke the halfe rode back as they were sent: Ruben, Gad with Manasses, to their possession went. An aulter made, and Israel flockt against them for to fight: When they heard tel why it was built, they said the deed was right. The xxiii. chapiter. Cast in age was Iosua tho, and Israel he did call: And shewed th? what the Lord had doon, and tolde it to them all. Muche more he said that God would doo if in his wil they bide: If not he tolde them plain afore, that they should be destroyd. The xxiiii. chapiter. Declare on forthe he did at large what God had for them wrought And bad them serue the Lord alone whiche thither had them brought. So speke they did with often voice, the only Lord to fear: And Iosua dide and Iosephs bones, were earth and buried there. Iosua now is ended quite, the book hath run his race: The book of Iudges now beginnes, in like to take his place. Sophtim: Iudicum: Iudges. The first Chapiter: Ahead to haue they did desire, in Iosuas roum to be: And Iuda to them pointed was, who fought ful manfully. Ierusalem they took and wan, great Giants did they slay: The Gentiles with them stil did dwel but tribute did they pay. The ii. chapiter. Because they did not kil them all an Angel did them chide: And Iosua dead they buried him, down by his fathers side. When that stock all was dead &amp; gone, ful wicked were the next: And serued Gods that were forbod, whose names are in the text. The iii. chapiter. Certain nations then are named, that with them then did dwel: But one them kild and bet them down named Othoniel: Yet after that they were opprest, but Ahud them did saue: For in a parlour with the King, his deaths wound he him gaue. The iiii. chapiter. Depart did yet the flock and went, and serued Idols vain: Of Iabin King of Canaan, yeeres twentie were they slain. And Debora then did them iudge, whom Barack shee did call: They sought and wan, but Sisara In Iaels hands did fall. The v. chapiter. Euen as the battaile ended was and Israel had the best: They sang a song of melody. wherin the Lord was blest. But curst were some that cam not foorth to help them for to fight: And blest was shee that with a naile slue Sisara outright. The vi. chapiter. Fare foule did then the Madianites, with Israel for their sin: An Angel stird vp Gedeon, their freedome for to win. The Idol Ball he did destroy, and burst his aulter down: His Father did his cause defend, against the Cittie or town. The vii. Chapiter. Gedeon foorth to battail went, the Madianites to kil: To mickle was his hoste (said God), for him to haue his wil. So many as feard were sent home back and those that stoupt to drink: Three hundred slue the Madianites, and made their kinges to shrink. The viii. chapiter. Halfe angry were the Ephraites, but Gedeon did them stil: Phanuel men and Sucoth bothe, did Gedeon take and kil. Two kings he slue and then they would, haue him and his their heds: He it denide, but gaue them cause, to doo ful wicked dedes. The ix. Chapiter. Ieroboas had three score sonnes, and ten in number true: Abimeleck he kild them all, saue Ioathan the Iew. Who them rebukte, they did him chuse, and Gaal rose in vain: So Sichem burnt and Thebez stroyd Abimeleck there was slain. The x. chapiter. Knowe wel ye may what guide they had, as Gods that were forbod: They were opprest and did repent, and called vnto God. Who bad them call vnto their Gods in trouble them to saue: They did suppresse their Idols quite, to God their mindes they gaue. The xi. chapiter. Look out did then the Galadites, a captain and a guide: Who willed Ammon not to fight but he his tale denide. Then Iephthath vowd a foolishe vow the victory to obtain: He had the feeld and home returnd, then was his daughter slain. The xii. chapiter. Murmour so did the Ephraites, at Iepthah had they spight Fortie thousand of them he slue, and put the rest to flight. A woord betrayd them many times, when Iordane they would take: Three Iudges there, are then exprest, and when their liues did slake. The xiii. chapiter. No longer did they fear the Lord, then Iudges good did liue: The vpper hand against them all the Lord their foes did giue. A man that was hight Manoah, had Samson to him plight: His wife him bare as God had said, with him dwelt God his sprite. The xiiij. chapiter. Of Samsons mariage ye may hear he would needs haue his wil: As he went down his spouse to woo, a Lion did he kil. A ridle axt and thirtie men, he slue to pay the hest: His calfe had tilde the thirties land, and went to his fellowes nest. The xv. chapiter. Pastime to make then Samson went to banket with his wife: Shee went not in so sprang a cause, of hatred and great strife. With Foxes fiery he brent their corn, Philistians did he slay: The iaw bone of an Asse he took, and thousands kild one day. The xvi. chapiter. Quarel they pickt to Samson stil, and him they watche to slay: But he that night burst vp their gates, and caried them away. He kept a whoore who beeing feed, his strength of him shee wan: Wh? he was blinde they causd him play but he destroyd them than. The xvii. chapiter. Reherst is then of mony lost, a woman did it misse: Micha her sonne did it confesse and said lo heer it is. Uowed shee had and would it keep, an Image did she make: A Leuite came and lodged there, whom Micha his preest did make. The xviii. chapiter. Spies were sent to serche the land, the tribe of Dan it wrought: At Michas house they lodgd all night where councel good they sought. Return they did with ioyful newes, and foorth they went to fight: The preest and Image they did take, and wan the land out right. The xix. chapiter. To mary against the law of God see what dooth them betide: A Leuites wife did play the whore, and flipped from her guide. He fetcht her home and as he went, at Gabaah was shee slain: Then sent he her in peeces twelue the deed for to complain. The xx. chapiter. Up then rose Israel for to fight, against the Beniamites: For whoredome fact, yet Israel was put vnto two great flightes. Then did they pray and God th? plight, to haue the higher hand: The Beniamites were killd on morn twentie and fiue thousand. The xxi. chapiter. And th? they sware that none of them, the Beniamites should wed: The men that went not vp to fight they vowed them but dead. They took their daughters and th? gaue the Beniamites to make: Yet not suffisde the dauncing dames to wiues they did them take. The book of Iudges is expirde, an end therof is made: The story of Ruthe ye shall haue next, so following scriptures trade. Ruthe. The first Chapiter. A dearth then fel in Iudaes land Emeleck with his wife: And his two sonnes to Moab went, there for to lead their life. The father died and his two sonnes, in mariage dide also: The mother then did home return, and Ruthe with her did go. The ii. chapiter. Beseech did Ruthe her mother in law, That shee some corne might lease: And foorth shee went to Booz his field whose sight shee did wel please. He bothe inquierd and with her talkte and her intreated wel: See tolde her mother at the night, the story euery dele. The iii. chapiter. Caused shee was by Nœmise woords, to sleep at Booz his feet: Who when he wakte and felt her there the truthe on her did weet. Shee tolde him all and who shee was then bad he her lie stil: And on the morne he gaue her corne and tolde her all his wil. The iiij. chapiter. Down sat Booz then and in the gate his kinsman did he call: He shewd to him afore the heads, what land to him did fall. He said he would not purchace it, so Booz the land did buy: And maried Ruthe who had a sonne. when he with her did lie. Ruthe dooth end at Chapters foure, shewing whom she did wed: A Gentile she was, yet she bare, the Graunsire to Dauid. The first of Kings ye shall haue now, whom Samuel some doo call: The stories shall declare you how, that Kings to them did fall. The first book of Samuel other wise called the first of the Kinges. The first Chapiter. A man two wiues had wedded tho, the one no children had: She had suche wo she praid to God, who sent to her a lad. Elkanah was her husbands name, and Hannah was shee hight: And Samuel did shee call her sonne whom shee to God had plight. The ii. chapiter. Begin did Hannah for to sing, and sang a goodly song: The sonnes of Ely were vnthriftes and did the people wrong. Ely them did rebukte but small, for whiche God did him chide: He sent a man to tel him plain his house should be destroyd. The iii. chapiter. Consumde was Elies sight away, and as he lay and slept: Samuel thrise the Lord did call, who vnto Ely stept. I call thee not it is the Lord, doo thou to him obay: And so hee did, and Ely knew, on him what God did say. The iiii. chapiter. Doughtely fought the Israelites yet were they put to flight: The Philistian hoste twise bet th? down and took their Ark by might. The sonnes of Ely they were kild, whiche when their father hard: He fel out of his seat for wo, and burst his neck backward. The v. chapiter. Early arose the Asdodits, their Dagon for to see: The Ark of God twise thrue him down, and bated his degree. Stricken they were with Emerodes the Ark made them ful wo: From whence it came they did decree, thither to let it go. The vj. chapiter. Fully and whole they did consent, that home the Ark should wend: With mise and arses made of golde, so home they did it send Two kine new milche did cary it the right way home they went The Bethsanites they it receiude, for whiche they were all shent. The vii. chapiter. God willed Israel that they should, their Idols quite destroy: By Samuels mouth and they confest their sinnes to him on hie. They willed Samuel for to pray, the enemies they did fear: They were destroyd &amp; fought no more the space of many a yeer. The viii. chapiter. How Samuels sonnes did wickedly the people did it ming: And not content of Samuel, they did desire a king. He them denide and axt the Lord who did to them consent: And bad him tel what he would doo, when he one to them sent. The ix. chapiter. It came to passe that Saule Cis sonne, his Asses went to finde: The Sear fondee he did inquire, who tolde him all his minde. Thy Asses they are found, and thou the Israelites must guide: He feasted him and on the morn, he took him sole on side. The x. chapiter. Kisse did Samuel and anoint, then Saul to be their King: And told him things which came to passe as he afore did ming. So Prophecy he did and tolde, his vnckle halfe his hap: The lot did fall to Saule as King, And vnthriftes grudgd therat. The xi. chapiter. Lay siege to Iabes Nahas did, whiche was an Ammonite: They did submit he sent them woord, their eyes to thrust out quite. Then seuen dayes respite they did take then ayd lesse they would yeeld. So Saule did win the peoples hartes in winning of the feeld. The xii. chapiter. Mark my woords said Samuel then, your willes I haue obayed: If I did wrong or taken bribe, it shall again be paide. How God had doon in time afore, and would doo he them tolde: With thunder and raine he feard all, and sharply them controlde. The xiii. chapiter. Now Saule being king, he got him men against his foes to fight: And when the hoste drue neer to Saule, he did that was not right. He offended God in dooing the thing that Samuel should haue doon, A Smith to make them tooles to fight, in Israel had they none. The xiiii. chapiter. Ouer with one then Ionathas went, his signe was true they fled When Saule it knew with all his men, he folowd vpon the dead. If any did eat ere night were come then die he should said Saule: Ionathas eat and should haue dide, the hoste denide it all. The xv. chapiter. Pointed was Saule of Gods owne, mouth the Amalakites to kil: He disobayd the almightie Lord, and folowd his foolishe wil. Then Samuel shewd him how that God, was sory he made him king: Obedience more he looks to haue, then any burnt offering. Halfe Samuels first book ye haue had, some say the first of Kings: VVherin is shewd the meruaylous woorks, of God in his dooings. Of Dauids calling to be King, Samuel did him noint: It shalbe shewd you afterward, the Chapters shall it point. The xvi. Chapiter. A point did God that Samuel should chuse Dauid to be King: For fear of Saule he went in close, and faind an offering. So Dauid being chosen king, an euil sprite came on Saule: When Dauid came and plaid on harp, the sprite went out of Saule. The xvij. chapiter. Boldly bragged Goliah then on his great might and strengthe None durst go out to cope with him, til Dauid came at length, Proffer he did to fight with him, yet harnes had he none. A sling he had and out he went, and kild him with a stone. The xviii. chapiter. Come out did women and did sing in ioy of enemies fall: They sang, ten thousand Dauid slue, a thousand slain of Saule. Then Saule deuised Dauids death, yet scapte he with his life: To haue his death, Michol he gaue, to be his spoused wife. The xix. chapiter. Deuise did Saul stil Dauids death, for all the othe he sware: And when he plaid to void the sprite he thrue at him a spear: Then in his house he had been slain, but Michol causd him flee: And they him sought, Saule and his men began to prophecy. The xx. chapiter. Eftsoones Dauid and Ionathas, compact their faiths in one: If Saule him mist and were displeasd he should knowe how to gon. Then Saule fel out with Ionathas, that void was Dauids place: Then by a signe he gaue him woord, to flee in any cace. The xxi. chapiter. Flee from Saule then Dauid did, to Ahimelech he came: The sew bread suttely he obtaind, but by was Sauls herdman. The Philistians swoord he got also, to Achis king he went: He was afraid he faind him mad, the King was not content. The xxii. chapiter. Go foorth dooth Dauid on his way, th' opprest to him did come: He left his kinred with a King, and went a way with some. Doeg tolde of Abimelech, for whom Saule sent and slue: And all the house and Town also, saue one that fled the crue. The xxiii. chapiter. Help did Dauid a Cittie bessegd Reylah it was calld: And Saule wel hopte to kil him there it was a Cittie walld. In a thicket he was betraid, Saule thought him to haue spoild: The streight was great Dauid was in but Saule then home recoild. The xxiiij. chapiter. In daunger great was Saule the king in caue so it did hap: If Dauid would he had been slain, he cut but his cote lap. Then Dauid cride to Saule and said, see what I might haue doon: So Saule sware Dauid to be good, to him in his kingdome. The xxv. chapiter. Knowe ye may of Samuels death, and Naball his sheep shearing: Who angred Dauid very muche, his churlishe part once hearing. If Abigail had him not met, they had then lost their life: Immediatly the fool did die, and Dauid had his wife. The xxvi. chapiter. Liyng a sleep in Abners tent, Saule lost his spear and cruse: Whiche Dauid had and cride aloud, and tolde it them as newes. When Saule had heard all Dauids minde, his fault he did confesse: And knowledge Dauids reign as king, and last he did him blesse. The xxvii. chapiter. Muche a doo had Dauid with Saule, therfore he fled the land: And went to Achis King of Geth, in the Philistian land. He slue of them in rouing wise, and left not one a liue: And tolde the king another tale, who did his woords beleeue. The xxviii. chapiter. Now battaile begins between them bothe and Saule to God did speak: He had no woord of God again, when he his minde did break. A woman him raisd as he beleeued, Samuel that then was dead: Who tolde him plain he should be slain, and Dauid set in his stede. The xxix. chapiter. Out went the heathen by their ranks, the Lords did Dauid spie: They axt of Achis what he was, who him extolde on hie. But they were fumde and said plainly he would doo them some lack: And Achis tolde to Dauid all, who early sent him back. The xxx. chapiter. Perished was the town with fire, where Dauids wiues did dwel: And men and women led away, then Dauid axt councel. Followe he did and them destroid and home returnd again: The spoiles was delt and presentes sent the riches of the slain. The xxxi. chapiter. Quickly fled the Israelites, and gaue their foes the feeld: Saules sonnes were slain at the same time and Saule him self there kild. His harnes and his body bothe they hung them vp on hie: His body and his sonnes were burnt their bones layd at a tree. This book the first is doon and past at Saules death it dooth end: The second next while it dooth last, ye shall haue we intend. The second book of Samuel other wise the second of the Kings. The first Chapiter. A yung man caried Dauid woord, that Saule in feeld was slain: For making of a lie to him, death had hee for his pain. Then Dauid wept and mourned sore for Saule and Ionathas death: And sang a song all ful of wo, that they had lost their breath. The ii. chapiter. Begin did Dauid then to reign, in Hebron kingd he first: And Isboseth by Abners meanes, anoint him Israel durst. Then twelue &amp; twelue so plaid in sporte, that one eche other slue: Tween bothe the houses for that part, the battail gan to brue. The iii. chapiter. Company with a Concubine, made Abner to rebel: From Isboseth he yeelded vp, to Dauid Israel. When he was gone in peace away by Ioab he returnd: Who did him kil ful gilefully, for whom the king sore mournd. The iiii. chapiter. Dampt was Israel with their king, when Abners death they heard: Two of the heads slue Isboseth, and had a right reward. To Dauid they did bring his head and hoped to haue thank: As he that brought Saules death to him, so had they for their prank. The v. chapiter. Eche sides were made now all in one Iuda and Israel: And nointed Dauid once again, who ruled them ful wel. Hierusalem of Iebusites, did Dauid win and take: And battails twain he wan by might, and made his foes to quake. The vi. chapiter. From Abinadab thark was fetcht, and Ozah God did strike: Therfore with Obed it was left, whiche made him wel to like. When Dauid knew he fetcht it home afore it he did daunce: Michol mockt him and for her fee no children was her chaunce. The vii. chapiter. God vnto Dauid did deny, a house for him to build: Ishrowded not in Ceder trees, but dwelt alwaies in feeld. Thy sonne a house shall rear for me, and reign for euermore: Then Dauid wholy praisd the Lord and thanked him therfore. The viii. chapiter. How Dauid vsde his enemies, and linde their liues and death: The Assirians he did subdue, and thousands lost their breath. A forren King to him did yeeld, and sent him giftes ful great: He gaue them all to God and dooth, his rulers names repeat. The ix chapiter. In memory came to Dauids minde, his vow to Ionathas made: Ask he did if any were left, that promise might be paid. Miphiboseth was found and brought to whom the king gaue land: And set him at his bord alway all this he did commaund. The x. chapiter. Know ye may of an heathen king, towards Dauid euil behaued: Iust by their tailes he cut their coats and halfe their beards he shaued. With Dauids men this part he playd, who did his deeds requite: He did him foile with all his power and put his ayd to flight. The xi. chapiter. Lust caused Dauid for to sin, with Bethsabe in deed: Shee was with childe and then he sent, for Vrias with speed. And when he would not lie with her, he sent him back again: And suche woord sent that he was set, in place where he was slain. The xii. chapiter. Maruaylous angry was the Lord, with Dauid for this part: When he it wist he did repent, the deed with all his hart. God him forgaue but yet the childe, did die for this il thing: Then next shee bare him Salomon, who afterward was King. The xiii. chapiter. Now Thamar was a fair yung maid, and Ammon did her lust: He faind him sick and had his wil and from him did her thrust. Then Absalon her brother deer, did stil her from her cry: And two yeer after causd him kild and afterward did flee. The xiiii. chapiter. Ouer passid was Dauids fume, and Ioab wrought a feat: By a woman for Absalon, that home he might him get. The king did graunt and home he came, but would not yet him see: Procured, Ioab spake for him, then kist the king and he. The xv. chapiter. Pick so away the peoples hartes from Dauid did his sonne: Rebel he did against the king, this same was Absalon. The King did flee for fear of him, bare footed and did weep: Yet had he spies that wrought for him whose councel they did keep. The xvi. chapiter. Quietly passed he the hil, and Ziva brought him giftes Whom Semei curst and he preferd, God in his secreat driftes. Then Husai the rebel sarud, but he was Dauids spie: And Absalon in open sight, with Dauids wiues did lie. The xvii. chapiter. Refused was Ahithophel, his councel took no place: But Husay his woords were liked wel, and Dauid knew the cace. Then Dauid fled but Ahithophel, him self did hang for wo: And diuers men brought Dauid food their hunger mooued them so. The xviii. chapiter. So number Dauid did his men and set them out in ray: And charge gaue Dauid for his sonne, his life in him to stay. But contrary the feeld once wun Ioab did thrust him thorowe: When Dauid wist, he took on so, That ioy was turnd to sorowe. The xix. chapiter. To stay his sorow, Ioab went, and brought the king in sight: Then did Israel ioy it muche, and willed him his right. Whole Iuda came as they were wilt their king home for to bring: And Israel was not wel content, for dooing of that thing. The xx. chapiter. Up then rose a rebel again, and Seba was his name: He mooued Israel to rebel, to get him self a fame. Besiegd he was in Abel town, they had been all as dead: But that a woman found the meanes, that cast out was his head. The xxi. chapiter. A plague then came of three deer yeeres, Saules kindred was the cause: When his seauen sonnes were hanged vp the death began to pause. Of mightie men the chapter speakes Philistians that were slain: Their speares as big as weauers beames, yet serued they as vain. The xxii. chapiter. Begin did Dauid then to sing, and sang a song of praise: Extolling God for his great help shewed to him alwaies. He hath me kept and been my sheeld and made my foes to fall: Therfore thou liue and blest be thou among the heathen all. The xxiii. chapiter. Christe by Dauid heer is tolde, his kingdome and his might: And valiant men are then exprest, the whiche for him did fight. Eight hundreth men are slain of one another withstood a feeld: Three fetched water through an hoste, the fourth made Lions yeeld. The xxiiii. chapiter. Dauid did then his people tel, and numbered then soon And when he wist he did repent, the deed that he had doon. Plagde he should be and did require, Pestilence to reign: Threescore and ten thousands of men, afore it seast were slain. The second book of Kings is doon, or Samuel as you wil: The third shall come by God his grace, and so foorth wil we stil. Twentie and foure it hathe conteind, and twentie and two the next: In all these chapters ye shall finde, the order of the text. The third book of the Kings after the Latines, after the Hebrues the first of the Kings. The first Chapiter. As Dauid waxed olde he had a maid to keep him warm: Adoniah did king him self, he fearing then no harm. By Nathans meanes was Salomon set, and crownd in Dauids seat. The noise once heard they fled for fear, the head did him entreat. The ii. chapiter. Because that Dauid saw by age that death approched neer: His sonne he charged God to loue, and him alone to fear. As touching Ioab and Semei, of them he tolde his wil: Adoniah, Abiathar, these foure came vnto il. The iii. chapiter. Communication had the Lord, with Salomon the King: Aske what thou wilt, said God to him, for wisdome did he ming. The Lord it likte and gaue it him and straight it was espied: Two wemen straue about one childe, and he the trothe out tried. The iiii. chapiter. Declard is then his rulers names and caters for his boord: The number of his bread and beef, that dayly he did foord. Three thousand prouerbs he did write, a thousand songs and fiue: Of beastes and foules, &amp; wormes &amp; fishe he wrote of them beliue. The v. chapiter. Euen at that time the king of Tire, whiche Hiram hight by name: He sent to Salomon when he heard, of his great might and fame. And then they two did ioyne in league, the king of him had wood: And Hiram did receiue again, corne for his dayly food. The vi. chapiter. Fully preparde the king began, Ierusalem to build: Ful costly woork he made of it, and richely he it steld. Two Cherubs did he make ful gay, and coured them with golde: Galaries did he rear also, and all things as he would. The vij. chapiter. Go foorth did Salomon and did build, him self a goodly place: And made two pillers wunderful and cast they were of brasse. A Sea also, and Lauers great, with mickle things yet more: Of golde and siluer vessels gay, he made therof good store. The viii. chapiter. House did Salomon then the Ark, and set it in his place: And prayed to God ful meruailously for many a sundry cace. He him besought for diuers things, I would you red them all: And offered great offerings, as there perceiue ye shall. The ix. Chapiter. In talke was God with Salomon, and these woords he him tolde If he and his would keep his law, be in his house he would. To Hiram gaue he Citties great, the heathen tribute paid: And thrise a yeer burnt sacrifice, afore the Lord was laid. The x. chapiter. Knowledge then had a forren Queen of Salomons great fame: And when shee had him proou'd and seen, shee did confirm the same. Golde was plentie in that time, and also precious stones: And Siluer was so plentie tho, as in the street are stones. The xi. chapiter. Loue did Salomon concubines whiche caused him to sin: He serued Gods beside the Lord, therfore said God to him: I warned thee but all in vain, thy kingdome shalbe rent. He stirred him vp diuers foes, ere to his graue he went. The xii. chapiter. Many men then did flock in one, Rehoboam to noint: He answered them so churlishely, they waid him not a point. Ieroboam then did they chuse, and him they made their King: He made them calues and hil aulters, and burnt thereon offring. The xiii. chapiter. Nothing abasht a Prophet tolde, the ruine of the aulter: The King his hand was dryed vp, and God did heal it after. The Prophet then he did not keep but brake the Lord his wil: As he returnd for his reward, a Lion did him kil. The xiiii. chapiter. Olde was Ahiah when he tolde, the Queen the kingdoms fall: And of her Lord and sonne also, and truthe he tolde her all. Ieroboam, Rehoboam, of Iuda and Israel kings: They died bothe then and their sonnes, began in their diyngs. The xv. chapiter. Plaste was Abiam of Iuda King, a wicked man in deed: His sonne Asa destroyd the stues, when he did him succeed. Nadab euil in Israel reignd, and Baasa him did kil: Ieroboams seed he rooted out, and ruled the realm at wil. The xvi. Chapiter. Quenched was Baasa and his house, his stock of Zamri slain: Amry was crownd and Zamri burnt, him selfe besieged in pain. When Amri of Thebni had his wil then ruled he but not wel: And Ahab his sonne more wicked th? he who maried Iezabel. The xvii. chapiter. Rauens fed Eliah in the drought, until the riuer was dry: The drought continued three yeer space, as he did prophecy. At Sareptha in a widdowes house, he lay, and increast her food: And liued her sonne when he was dead so turn he did her mood. The xviii. chapiter. Searching for grasse Eliah met, with him that prophets hide By him the King met Eliah, so eche the other chide. The preestes of Ball for all their noise no fier could obtain: But Eliah did and causd them kild, and straight began the raine. The xix. chapiter. Uhen Iezabel him vowd to kil, from whom he fled for fear: Then fortie dayes with little food he went as dooth appeer. At Oreb hil with God he spake, two Kings he wild him noint: Elizeus then in his roum, a Prophet he did point. The xx. chapiter. Warre sure did then King Bennadab, against Samaria twise: On hil or plain he was destroyd, it was the Lords deuice. But when that Israel peace did make with that vngracious king: The king had woord to be destroid, and his realm for that thing. The xxi. chapiter. Ahab then sought a vine yard, of Naboth but in vain: The wicked Queen hight Iezabel, that causd him to be slain. Possession when he went to take, his death was tolde him iust: The doges should lick vp bothe their bloodes to teache them haue suche lust. The xxii. chapiter. Boldely so bad the Prophets false, Rameth besiegd to be: But Micha did from them discent, therfore to iayle went he. As he had said Hahab was slain, But Iudahs King was saued: In Crownacles their actes are tolde, how they them selues behaued. The third of Kings after this text, in order ye haue had: And now the fourth with meeeter like, to you it shalbe clad. iiii. of Kings. The first Chapiter. Ahab his sonne, Ohoziah out of a windowe fel: If he should scape to Belsebub, he sent, he should him tel. Eliah sent them back straight way, to tel him he should die: Two fifties burnt the third him brought but he nought did denie. The ii. chapiter. Before Eliah was taken vp, he parted Iordane brook: Elizeus had double spirite, and vp his mantel took. The brook with it he did deuide, and made the waters sweet: The boyes with beares they were destroyd for mocking it was feet. The iii. chapiter. Custome then a King denide, of paying his Lambes and sheep: To Iehoram, who with two Kings, against him went to fight. Elizeus water helpt them to, and made their iourney good: The Edomites were far deceiued, the water lookt like blood. The iiii. chapiter. Detted was a widdowe sore, her oyl was muche increast: A woman a childe had and it died, the prophet her pain releast. Colloquintida in the potage was put, he made them sweet with meale. He multiplyed the loues at ful, and left an ouerdeal. The v. chapiter. Euilly plagued was Naaman, with leprosy in deed: By aduice to Iury he went, for help as he had need. Although the King did fear him muche the Prophet him did heal: The Prophets man for taking fee the sore had euery deal. The vj. chapiter. Ful lightly swam the Iron aboue, Elizeus made it so: The Sirian king sent him to catche, but wrongly they did go. Samaria then was so besiegd, that eat they did a childe: The King was bent the prophet to kil, but yet he was begilde. The vii. Chapiter. Good cheap of things the prophet tolde, the next day for to haue: A certain Lord denied the same, for whiche his life he gaue. The Sirians fled with noyes they heard, God made them so afraid: The cheap was had and he did die, of whom afore was said. The viii. chapiter. How vij. yeeres dearth should come &amp; fall a woman had it tolde: And Benhadab dead then Hazael, to King he durst be bolde. Iehosaphat, Iehorams sonne, of Iuda he was king: Ohoziah did him sucseed, bothe these were euil raigning. The ix. chapiter. Iehu is then annointed King, on Israel to reign: The Kings of Iuda and Israel, by him they were bothe slain Then Iezabel in best aray, out of windowe was throwne: The Dogs her eat then was Gods way ful iustly on her knowne. The x. chapiter. Kill did Iehue, Ahab his sonnes, whiche were three score and ten: And all his stock and frutes also, were killed quite vp then. And all Balls preestes into Balls house, by sleight he did them get: They were all kild and Ball destroyd this was his holy feat. The xj. chapiter. Like wise the sonnes of Ohoziah, Athalia made them slain: But one was kept that cut her short ouer Iuda to reign. Then Iehoas by the bishops mean, was set in fathers seat: His grandame shee was killed then, suche measure did he meat. The xii. Chapiter. Muche prouision then was made the temple to repair: For costes and charges they not stuck so it were mended fair. And Hazael his hoste was stayed, for comming to giue feeld: Iehoas men with treason great, their king they took and kild. The xiii. chapiter. Now the next king of Israel, whiche was Iehu his sonne: The Sirian king did so him vexe, that he was ouercome. At Elizeus the King had hope, while he was yet aliue: He being dead, the dead him toucht and straight he did reuiue. The xiiii. chapiter. Of diuers kings this chapter telles, that wickedly did reign: The king whose father two did kil, he causd them to be slain. Their names, their yeeres, &amp; noble deeds the Crownacles doo tel: That Iuda ruled and bare the stroke also of Israel. The xv. chapiter. Paid was then a certain King, with Leprosie for sin: And then to kil their kings apace the traytours did begin. Nine kings small while in Israel raignd so spirde they to the crown: But as they reignd with bloody hands with blood so went they down. The xvi. chapiter. Quite against the law of God, king Ahaz burnt his sonne: The king of Israel battail great, against him then begun. For ayd he sent to Assiria, and it he did obtain: An aulter straunge he causd to make, Vriah took the pain. The xvij. chapiter. Rehearst is the captiuitie, that Israel came vntoo: The Assirian king them led away to teache them euil to doo. O read the chapter I you pray, and mark what sin dooth bring: It is theffect of muche afore, giue it therfore reading. The xviii. chapiter. So then the King Hezekiah, in Iuda ruled wel: The brasen Serpent he burst down, his foes found him ful fel. Then Rabsakeh the Sirian Lord, the Iewes he did defie: In their knowen tung he spake aloud, against the Lord on hie. The xix. chapiter. To Ezay sent the king to knowe if God would defend: He had good comfort at his hand, good tidings did he send. The king did pray his prayer was heard Senacheribs hoste was slain. An Angel kild them in the night: so was his brags in vain. The xx. chapiter. Unto the King he beeing sick: woord came that he should die: He wept and prayd and fifteen yeer, he had to liue perdie. For shewing of his treasures great to straungers, God him tolde: To Babilon his seed should go, with thraldoms many folde. The xxi. chapiter. And then Manasses in his reign: the Idols did restore: And wrought suche euil and wickednes, as none did him before. Dreadful threats the Prophetes tolde and Amon had his place: His seruantes kild him and were kild the people quit his cace. The xxij. chapiter. Begin to reign did Iosiah, when he was eight yeer olde: At eyghteen yeer the book was found, whiche made his hart ful colde. To a woman wise he sent to know, the Lord almighties wil: Shee sent him woord that he should se no point of Iudahs il. The xxiii. chapiter. Call vp whole Iuda did the King, and read to them the law: The smoky preestes and Idols all, he burnt them vp like straw. Their graues, their aulters and their groues not one of them he left: When he was kild his sonne did reign, to Idols he him feft. The xxiiii. chapiter. Depart Iehoakim did and dide, his sonne did him sucseed: Hierusalem besieged was, ouercome it was in deed. To Babilon then were they led, all of them saue the poor: And Zedechiah rose against, the Babilonishe power. The xxv. chapiter. Egerly then frome Babilon, the king came with an hoste: A yeer and more the Cittie fought, but yet at last they lost. Zedechias sonnes were kild he saw, the wicked did so rout: The Town and Temple was destroid, and then his eyes thrust out. The last and fourth book of the Kings, the second some it call: Is gone and past with matters hard, in meeter for to fall. The Crownicles the douts shall mend, God let vs liue therto: And send vs grace to doo the thing, that we intend to doo. Finis. The first book of the Chronicles. The i. chapiter. Adam his ligne is heer exprest, to Iacob and Esau: Then haue you tolde what kings did rule the Edomites by law: Eight kings they had before the time, that Israel had a King: What Dukes they had ye may haue there if you inquire the thing. The ii. Chapiter. Begin the second Chapter dooth, with Iacob and his sonnes: And then of Iudahs progeny it next in order comes. Seauen were the sonnes that Isay had, whose father was Obed: And Dauid yungest was of them, yet was he made their hed. The iii. chapiter. Concubines diuers Dauid had, of sonnes he had nineteen: In Hebron sixe, Hierusalem there had he iust thirteen. These by his wiues, to him were born in whiche was Salomon: The Kings that ruled after him, the chapter telleth on. The iiii. chapiter. Drawn out is then the ligne and stock of Iudah and his kin: In wanting food to feed their sheep good pasture they did win. Of Simions sonnes somewhat is said how valiantly they went: They beeing few yet sped they wel, and had their whole intent. The v. chapiter. Euil fauoured lust to fathers wife lost Ruben his birthright: And Iosephs stock came in his roum, a people ful of might. Yet is his stock heer tolde, and what a noble fight they fought: A land they wan, but after fel, from God, who draue them out. The vi. Chapiter. Folowing on of Leuies ligne expressed is at large: Of whom came Aaron and his sonnes that had the preestly charge. Citties they had of other tribes, for refuge, and besides For them, and their posterities, as lots to them were guides. The vii. Chapiter. Going on foorth by Israel, to tel who came of him: Of Izacar and Beniamin, Manasses and Ephraim. Then Ephraims stock by men of Gath, were slain whiche made him sad: His freends did comfort him right wel, and then a sonne he had. The viii. chapiter. Hear more is tolde of Beniamin, his sonnes by right discent How they begat from childe to childe and lineally foorth went. Out of which tribe came foorth king Saul and of his sonnes by rowe: Is tolde and eke of valiant men, that shot wel in a bowe. The ix. chapiter. Israel is now numbred, in certain tribes by name: The Leuites and the cheefest preestes that were of greatest fame. The ouerseears of the woorks, the porters in their charge: The oyntment makers &amp; vessel keepers, are heer tolde out at large. The x. chapiter. King Saule is slain by Philistins, and Ionathas his sonne: His body stript his hed cut of, after the feeld was wun. The cause is tolde why he was slain: by councelling with the Deuil: And Dauid brought into his raign, who rooted out muche euil. The xi. chapiter. Like as the Lord had promised by Samuel his man: So Dauid now is chosen King, Hierusalem he wan. His noble men are tolde by name and eke their mightie actes He that wil read the chapter out, shall hear of woorthy factes. The xii. chapiter. Men that of might were meruailous, to Dauid now did flock: And suche as knew the feates of warres came out of euery stock. Out of eche tribe good souldiers, their captains with their number, Are heer so tolde and with suche hart? as might make Dauid wunder. The xiii. chapiter. Now Dauid heer dooth councel take the Ark first home to bring: Whiche Saule did nothing care to doo as long as he was king. And one was slain for touching it when as the Ark did shake: So came it short to Sion hil, it made the king to quake. The xiiii. chapiter. Of woork men and of Ceder trees, sent to him heer is tolde: Wherby his kingdome stablished, to say he durst be bolde. His sonnes and wiues are then exprest, the Philistines inuade: With God he talkte, whose wil obayd, he flue them in a slade. The xv. chapiter. Prepare did he a multitude, for to fetche home the Ark: The Leuites bare it on their backs, plesantly sang eche clark. With shouting noise and instruments and Dauid daunst his part: The daintie damsel Michol then, despisde him in her hart. The xvi. chapiter. Quietly now the Ark is set, the tabernacle vnder: The preestes appointed to giue thanks, according to their number. A Psalme he made in praise of God, to laud his holy name: In the hundred and the fift Psalme there shall ye finde the same. The xvii. chapiter. Refuse did God that Dauid should an house vnto him build: But as before so would he stil, dwel vnder tent in feeld. But that a sonne of his should make a house he was content: Then lauded he the Lord therfore, sitting within his tent. The xviii. Chapiter. Suche battailes then as Dauid fought this chapter dooth declare: The Philistines, the Moabites, they all subdued are. The Edomites with other Kings, did Dauid ouerthrowe: And those that were his rulers cheef, their names heer may ye knowe. The xix. chapiter. Then Dauid sent of right good wil, a new King for to greet: The messengers were madly shauen their cotes cut ful vnmeet. Suche wrath their maister took therfore that battail gan to broile: The Moabites, the Aramites, they fled and had the spoile. The xx. chapiter. When Princes vse in battaile ray their armies to set out: Then Ioab went and wan a town and took a King ful stout. Whose crown was set on Dauids head, whiche waid a waightie waight: Suche Giants then were ouerthrowne as lackt no strength nor height. The xxi. chapiter. According as the Deuil did tempt, Dauid did tel his flock: Of three hard stripes the Pestilence, he chose to be his stroke. Three score and ten thousands of men, the Angel did deuour: The plague is ceast, an aulter built, vpon a threshing floure. The xxii. chapiter. Being at rest now in his seat, all things he dooth prouide: Wherwith to build to God an house, at the apointed tide. Good councel to his sonne he giues, for to erect the same: His noble men he dooth exhorte, to help the woork to frame. The xxiii. Chapiter. Chosen king was Salomon then by Dauid for to reign: The preesthood eke of Leuies kinde, was numbered again. Then Aarons stock and Moyses ligne are pointed bothe as one: Their names and eke their offices, for them to wait vpon. The xxiiij. chapiter. Deuision of Aarons seed, the king by lot did make: And so eche man that had his roum, by lot he did it take. Yet was there left of Amrams house, whose names by course are tolde: And lots were cast for equalues, betwixt the yung and olde. The xxv. chapiter. Eche man that should on instrument, his melody to play: And Prophecies to sing therto, were pointed out that day. Their names are tolde by lotted lot who set to eche degree The songs of God, onely they sung in laudes of God perdie. The xxvi. chapiter. For porters men were pointed out to keep the south and west: For other gates besides therto, and for the north and East. Where spoiles were laid in battail wun, and giftes giuen by the powers: Fit men were chose and pointed out, therof to keep the doores. The xxvii. chapiter. Gides &amp; captains the whiche did rule, eche month their pointed race: Their names and number heer is tolde from tribe to tribe in place. Ouerseears of diuers things, this chapter dooth you tel: What names they had, what was their charge and of the Kings councel. The xxviij. chapiter. How Dauid calld the multitude, and then said vnto them: God me denide, and plight my sonne to build Hierusalem. He gaue his sonne a goodly charge and of the woork the plat. And left him golde abundantly, and men of skilful art. The xxix. chapiter. In Golde and eke in siluer bothe in Iron and in Brasse: That Dauid left, and what he gaue, and eke how muche it was. With what the princes all did giue how Salomon was crownd: His fathers death and yeeres of reign, all this may hear be found. The first book of the Chronicles, is come to his last line: The chapters are a score by tale, and therto putting nine. From Adam vnto Dauids reign, thus Esdras hath you tolde: VVho writ these books of Chronicles, the Iewes of them so holde. In ample maner is exprest, how that he kept his charge: I mean of Dauids princely life, is heer tolde you at large. Of Salomons ruling of them and eke of princes mo: Now shalbe tolde if God permit, in order as they go. The second book of the Chronicles. The first Chapiter: An offring great at Salom? made, what likte, God bad him craue: Long life nor welth, ne wrathful wrath he cared not to haue. But wisdome askt, God did him graunt and welth with honour fraught: The store of Golde and costly things, were out of Egipt brought. The ii. chapiter. Build would he now to God an house, as leaue was to him let: His woork men tolde, and also how more to them he did get. Of letters sent to king of Tire, and eke their whole contents: And how with like he sent again, wherto the king consents. The iii. chapiter. Cause did now this Salomon King the house of God to build: On threshing floure that Dauid bought whiche stood in Moriah feeld. Eche porche &amp; house the length &amp; bredth. the cherubs with their wings: The vale of silk and pillers bothe, this chapter to you mings. The iiii. chapiter. Deuisde of brasse an aulter was, and eke a molten sea: With Oxen for to bear it vp, eche quarter three to stay. Candlesticks, cauldrons, tables ten, with beesoms and fleshe hooks: And other things as he may see who so the Chapters looks. The v. chapiter. Eche thing that Dauid had bequest to God by dedication: Is put into the temple then, after a solemn fashion. The Ark and that that was therin, is brought therto also: The singing men and instruments ful plesantly did blowe. The vi. chapiter. Faith made the King to God to pray, when he his flock had blest: With armes spred out and bowed knees, thus made he his request. That when the people did offend, and for their sinne were strook: If in that place they praid to him, that he would on them look. The vii. chapiter. God likte his prayer then so wel, that fire so down he sent And burned vp the sacrifice, his glory was present. And graunt he did the Kings request to him conditionally: If he and his would walke vpright, els would he all destroy. The viii. chapiter. How Salomon Citties did make this chapter dooth you tel: And how he brought his wife to home, in house where shee should dwel The offrings that he offred then, are eke vnto you tolde: And how he sent his men in ships, to Opher fetching golde. The ix. chapiter. In fame his name was spred abrode, wherby of Saba Queen: Came him to see, who praisd him muche when shee his state had seen. His yeerly rentes how long he rulde his treasure and his grace: His riches, and his seeking to the ending of his race. The x. chapiter. Knowing his death his sonne did reigne called Rehoboam: Who beeing rulde by counsel euil muche trouble therby came. For then the people did rebel, and chose another hed: Ten tribes did shrink away from him whom Ieroboam led. The xi. chapiter. Leese did the King his labour then his army beeing prest: And Citties strong with speed he made to keep his land in rest. Rehoboam of whom we speak did marry many wiues. Then foorth is tolde what they him bare, and eke how many liues. The xii. chapiter. Made is the kingdome sure &amp; strong, from God they all declinde God sent them foes for to inuade, for breaking of his minde. A Prophet tolde them of their faults to God they did conuert: He turnd his wrath, the King had peace, and so hee did depart. The xiii. chapiter. Now when his sonne calld Abiah succeeded in his place: Then made he war with Israel, telling to them the cace. He put his trust in God alone, Ieroboam had the woorst. He dide a death vnknowne to vs, as one that was acurst. The xiiii. chapiter. Of Abiahs death this chapter telles, and eke of Asas reign: What peace he had how God he sarud destroying Idols vain. Also what prayers he made to God when warres to him was sent: And how the Lord gaue him the spoile in Cittie and in tent. The xv. chapiter. Prophesy did a Prophet then, to Asa him to bolde: Bothe he and his did swear and vow Gods law to keep and holde. The contrary should die the death, that would not God obay: He put his mother from her seat, and burnt her Idoll gay. The xvi. chapiter. Quarelling wise the Israel King, built Rama in the way: And Asa golde to Bennadab sent Baasahs rage to stay. A Prophet did rebuke the fact, to prison was he sent: The King is sick and phisick seeks more then th'omnipotent. The xvii. chapiter. Right wel Iehosophat did rule succeeding Aass reign: With seruing God in perfet hart, it turned to his gain. His Lords he sent to teache the flock whole Iuda thorowe out: His Citties mand, his gard was great, of thousands round about. The xviii. chapiter. So ioynd with Ahab peace he made, then with the Israel king: Whose Prophetes all did tel a lie, but Micha truthe did bring. In prison he is cast therfore the Kings to battaile wentt Iehosaphat he scaped hard, but Ahabs life was spent. The xix. chapiter. Then was the King of Iuda shent, for ayding in that feeld: But then to Gods almightie law he did make his to yeeld. As ruler cheef of bothe thestates, of clergie and of lay: To vnder heds he gaue a charge, that there remaines for ay. The xx. chapiter. When woord came of a mightie hoste, whole Iuda to destroy: He prayers made a Prophet said, they should not them anoy. The hoste was slain the spoile was great yet as before he fel: Therof being tolde the lines doo lead, and of his end doo tel. The xxi. chapiter. As this King had ended his reign, Iehoram had his place: His brethern slain he did mar all in going Ahabs race: O look his end what blood him wan, a Prophet did him chide: Troubled w? warres &amp; sicknes straunge moste wretchedly he dide. The xxii. chapiter. Beeing without a King they tooke, Ahaziahu by name: His mothers wil he so perfourmd, as did bring to him blame. Iehu him slue whiche beeing noisd, Athalia it heard: The kingly stock shee kild to reign, but Ioas scaped hard. The xxiii. chapiter. Cunningly is he crowned King Athalia shee is slain: Ball is burst his preestes are kild true seruice plaste again. The officers set in comely wise, the hie preest did this deed: The King is seen and set in seat, all things did wel proceed. The xxiiii. chapiter. Deny did none but eche did giue the temple to repair The preestes were slack it would not serue the King had godly care. Iehoiada dead he fel from faith, and Zachari he slue: He foild in warres and sick is slain his seruantes were vntrue. The xxv. chapiter. Edom is put now to his flight, the traytors eke are kild: The King did trust in multitudes he turnd as he was wild: He fel from God, he was rebukte Amaziahu he hight. He mended not, his Cittie spoild, and kild he was in flight. The xxvi. chapiter. Faln a sleep his heire dooth reign Vsias was his name: He reigned wel til pride him took, then lost he all his fame. To Churche he yed incence to make a Leaper home he went: He dwelt alone, his sonne did rule to buriall so he went. The xxvij. chapiter. God set in place his sonne Iotham, who reigned rightfully: Saue that to churche he would not go, his folke liu'de wickedly The Ammonites he ouercame, Golde with wheat they him gaue: In peace and rest to graue he went, so writ of him ye haue. The xxviii. chapiter. Heire to Iotham was Ahaz King, the false way he did take: The Assire and the Israel head, they made his kingdome shake. Yet captains were returnd again his realm was throughly vext: The more he felt the woorse he delt, a better ruled next. The xxjx. chapiter. In royall state Hezekia, obtayned now the crown: The temple clensd he did erect, that was before put down. Oblations, and sacrifice, and offrings that were great: So hee and his thus serued God thus setled he his seat. The xxx. chapiter. Knowledge was giu? by letters sent, the paske for to be kept: Some laught, some mockt, &amp; some came vp thus were the people hept. Together as one a fortnight space, the paskal Lamb was eaten: And if the King had not stept in, some had of God been beaten. The xxxi. chapiter. Look what became conuerted men was doon as men reuiude: They burst their Gods &amp; found their preestes who liued of things were tithd: Such heaps were giuen that they might wait wholy vpon their charge: Their wiues and sonnes were cared for, they had all things at large. The xxxii. chapiter. Multitudes of souldiours came, then out of Assur land: An Angel did destroy the hoste, God took the thing in hand. Then Iuda King his hart was great, but sicknes did him tame: More yeeres he had, he liued riche, and died in great fame. The xxxiii. chapiter. Not wel, but euil, Manasses reignd, vntil that he was bound: Then prayers he made and did repent and fauour streight he found. Restored home he made away, the Idols that were vain: His sonne rulde il, his men him flue, and for it were they slain. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Of Iosias how wel he rulde, heer now to you is tolde: He sought for God and trimd his house his zeale was nothing colde. The law was found and he it heard, he rent his cote in sunder: As he was wild, he serued God so did likewise a number. The xxxv. chapiter. Passeouer was then held and kept, Iosias so it bad: From Samuels dayes before that time the like had not been had. He needs would fight with Egipt King yet Necho him forbad: So slain he was and buriall made, his flock with mourning clad. The xxxvi. chapiter. Quite quenched was the law of God King after King it foild: Some were put down, some captiue led their temple eke was spoild. They warned, mockt, to Babilon, so were they led as sheep: At seuentie yeeres they did return, so Cirus thought it meet. Thus ended are the Chronicles. two books they doo contain: The Iewes in one compile them bothe, to long, we make them twain. VVhen Esdras came from Babilon, the kingly acts destroyd: He pend these writs of breef rehearse, no man hath them anoid. The first book of Esdras. The first Chapiter. As spoken was by Ieremy, so Cirus Persia King: Commaunded Iewes home to return all suche as were willing. Their vessels eke he did them giue, of golde and siluer numbred: Fiue thousand were they in their tale and yet therto foure hundred. The ii. chapiter. Being so wild as thick as Bees, the Iewes from thence depart: In numbers great to Iuda land, they go with all their hart. Fiftie thousand, not many lesse, of soules to Iuda went: Zorobabel he was the cheef, whom Cirus thither sent. The iii. chapiter. Come home again into their land the temple ouerthrowne: They doo begin to build again, the trumpets they are blowne. And sacrifice they dayly make, the ground woork now is laid: Some sing, some shout, some weep for ioy eche one is wel apaid. The iiii. chapiter. Dissembling men pretended help, to build they were forbid: Then letted they all Cirus time, the building stowely yed. Darius reignd, to whom they writ, muche slaundering the Iewes: Who writ again and did forbid suche building for to vse. The v. chapiter. Eftsoones they build so Prophets wild, the cause was askt and why They answere made that they had leaue God let them to deny. Then wrote their foes vnto the King, the woork they did detest: What Cirus wild, that would they doo to bear they were ful prest. The vi. chapiter. Fo?d out for trouthe is Cirus graunt, and he dooth it reuiue: The hindrers of the woork he bids of life them to depriue. His house should eke a dunghil be suche charge he writ again: Then builded is the temple vp, and offerings thick are slain. The vii chapiter. God made the King Artaxersis so wel Esdras to loue: That he him sent to Iuda land, to serue the Lord aboue. Suche letters eke with him he gaue as woorthy are to read: A forren prince, a heathen man, the God aboue did dread. The viii. chapiter. Hundredes now doo flock and come with Esdras home to go: The Leuites lackt, he sent for some, their welth he did them showe. A fast was cride for aid to God, they shamde to aske a garde: So past they foorth so home they came, their bown aboue was heard. The ix. chapiter. In raging wise when Esdras heard, that gentile wiues were kept: He rent his clothes he tare his beard, and sorowfully he wept, When euening came he prayers made moste humbly vnto God: To stay his hand to stop his wrath, to keep away his rod. The x. chapiter. Knowledge they gaue to Esdras tho, that sore they did repent: Their heathen brides for to forgo, they were right wel content. The multitude are called vp, the raigny plague is fore Suche as offend they graunt to mend, Iudges are set therfore. Thus ended is now the first book, whiche Esdras hath to name: The second eke is called so, because he writ the same. Nœhemiah yet some it call: because of him it treats, You shall hear how the building fares, for all the wicked threats. The second book of Esdras. The first Chapiter. Asking for newes from Iury land, Nehemiah astond: The Cittie rackt and burnt adown hee shright and lowdly moend. Him self alone with weeping fast, he praid to God almight: His prayer did tend grace for to finde, in Aasuerus sight. The ii. Chapiter. Butler vnto the King he was, and sadly did he wait: The King him askt and he him tolde, then pasport had he straight. When to Hierusalem he came, he vewd the whole decay: Then cheerfully went foorth the woork, he would haue no denay. The iii. chapiter. Companies now in order built, eche one he took his place: Some of good wil, some in despite the woork went on apace. Of all estates laid to their hande, the building to aduaunce: And last of all the Goldesmiths build and so doo the merchants. The iiii. chapiter. Deadly hate the enemies took, that stil the Iewes did build: They scornd &amp; mockt, they did conspire, vnwares to giue them feeld. Their treason wrought came to the Iewes so were they prest to fight: Their foes were blank so souldierlike, they wrought and wacht by night. The v. chapiter. Eche m? cride out, y? dearth was great they pledgd their land for bread: The riche opprest the poor ful sore of God they had no dread. It was redrest, Nehemiah got pardon for the gaged: He liued without the peoples fee, all thing was wel eswaged. The vi. chapiter. Ful suttlely wrought the heathen then Nehemiah to kil: They sent for him ful oft with craft, he went not them vntil. The Prophetes false would him afraid, in faith he finisht all: Some bearing rule had hollowe hartes I think and euer shall. The vii. chapiter. Garded now is Hierusalem, with watche and eke with warde They are found out that first went vp, their names are red and heard. Some were put out their kin forworn, and some found right in blood: Bothe riche and poor gaue to the kark, it came to mickle good. The viii. chapiter. Hauing now doon the woork as ought, the law to them is read: The people wept and mourned sore, of God they were in dread. The teachers th? with gladsome woordes their fearfulnes remooues: The rulers all came for to hear, their feast was kept in boothes. The ix. chapiter. In fasting and in prayer bothe, with sack clothe mourningly: The people doo their alien wiues, forsake moste willingly. A godly prayer the preestes doo make Gods wunders to set out: How merciful he was to them, though stil they had been stout The x. chapiter. Knowne out were now how many would and eke therto subscribe: That they would haue the couen?t kept, the cheef of euery tribe: The things are tolde: wherto they swear to keep with all their hart: They doo protest with ful consent, they nil from them depart. The xi. chapiter. Lots then were cast in euery ten, one should appointed be: Hierusalem to make his shrowd, they did therto agree. So are they tolde from tribe to tribe, who did the cittie keep: The ressdue abrode did dwel, in townes as folded sheep. The xii. chapiter. Many there were that did return, home with Zorobabel: Preestes and Leuits their names in course this Chapter dooth you tel. And eke how that the wall therto, they doo it dedicate: With ranks beset with singing men with laudes from gate to gate. The xiii. chapiter. Now on that day the law was read, that straungers were forbod: To mixe among the Iewishe sect, and so from them they yod. The Saboth day they did not keep, the ruler it refourmd: And double men with heathen babes, with speed suche out he turnd. Nehemiah thus finisheth, the second some it call: Of Esdras now, and Esther next, in course to you shall fall. This prouerb heer is true ifound, the wicked makes his gin: To catche the iust, but he him self, is trapt and caught therein. The book of Esther. The first Chapiter. Ahasuerus or Darius, for so some doo him call: A royall feast he princely kept, to cheer bothe great and small. The Queen sent for to come in sight, shee did send flat her nay: Shee is deuorst and law is made, eche wife for to obay. The ii. chapiter. Beeing appeased of his wrath, the King had counsel then: That virgins should be chosen out, the fairst among women. So were they chose and purified, with garmentes gayly drest: The King had choise whiche should be Queen so Esther likte him best. The iii. chapiter. Courted now is a wicked man that Haman hight by name: Who wanting glory to his wil, he sought a bloody fame. By false report he got consent, the Iewes to kil and slay: The postes were sent to euery cost, and pointed was the day. The iiii. chapiter. Doleful cryes and shouts were made, the Iewes were so agast: Mardocheus to Court he came, the Queen was sore abasht. Shee sent him woord to fast and pray and so to wil the rest: Her life shee should in daunger put, yet was shee therto prest. The v. Chapiter. Esther then in her best aray, came foorth before the King: He likt her wel and Septer shewd, to testify the thing. The King did to her banket go, and Haman with him took: Who comming home vnto his house ful wicked councel took. The vi. Chapiter. Found out it was Mardocheus, the King had saued vnfeed: Who Haman axt what suche a one, should haue vnto his meed? In goodly robes to ride saith hee, with honour and with praise: To Mardocheus said the King, go doo the same straight wayes. The vii. Chapiter. Gon to banket is Haman now, to drink his last carrouse: The Queen then tolde her doleful hap, to her and to her house. Unto the King, who rose in wrath gainst Haman for the fact: His gallous for another made, his neck therin it crackt. The viii. chapiter. Hamans house Merdocheus had, his office therunto: The Queen did beg her peoples life, the King did graunt therto The posts were sent the ioy was great, the Iewes had suche releef: The woork of God on them so wrought, made some of their beleef. The ix. chapiter. In like as should the Iewes haue had so on their foes it fel: For some were slain, some hangd on tree the King did like it wel. Then did they point that day to keep, holy from yeer to yeer: With laudes &amp; praise, w? deeds of almes, as there it dooth appeer. As Esthers book is finished, so Iob ye shall haue next: The patient man, we wil you shew, according to the text. No Iew he was, but gentile born, yet did he walke aright: He was before that Moyses was, who did this book indight. The book of Iob. The first Chapiter: A man there was that dwelt in Hus, and Iob they did him call: Of riches great, who Sathan spoild, and reft it from him all. His Children eke, God gaue him leaue, with fire to send them hence: Yet for all this, he could not breke Iob of his patience. The ii. Chapiter. Biles and foule sores vpon his fleshe to vexe him woorse and woorse: The Deuil got leaue to plague him with the mightie Lord to curse. His wife also, who should haue been, his stay and eke comfort: Shee counseld him to curse the Lord, his freends did him exhort. The iii. chapiter. Cursed now be the day said Iob, wherein that I was born: For nought is heer but wretchednes our labour is forlorn. They are in blisse that graued be, their sorrowes then are doon: He wisht the pit his house had been, when life he first begoon. The iiii. chapiter. Doost thou then said one Elephas, waxe faint, whiche heer to fore: To suche as were in trouble like, hast been to them a lore? The Lord wil doo what pleaseth him, there is none iust but hee: The Angels macht, vnto their God vnpure are found to be. The v. chapiter. Eliphas stil proceedeth foorth, with pacience him to arme: He prooues the wicked in their welth haue soon come vnto harme. And how the iust continually, from God haue their defence: He telleth Iob his happy state, afore that he go hence. The vi. chapiter. Ful sore in sores Iob dooth reply, confessing he is weak: And wishing death rebuking suche as to him would not speak. And eke to suche as taunted him, he liked not their talke: He prooueth that in woord and deed he righteously did walke. The vii. chapiter. Go on our dayes we doo on earth as shadowes, or as clouds: And sudenly we leaue behinde our emptie framed shrouds. Both night and day they haue their toys with woork and dreames itost: Wherfore if God did not vs keep, so were we surely lost. The viii. chapiter. Help is there none said Bildad th?, for thee in thy distresse: But prayers to make in puritie, and so thy sinnes confesse. Then shalt thou haue thy good again, and eke therto increace: But Hipocrites that trust in deeds, their glory soon shall ceace. The ix. chapiter. Iob did consent and dooth affirm, that God is muche of might: And eke more iust then what he made, none like him in his sight. And that whoso with him dooth plead, let him of this be sure: He shalbe forced to confesse, him self to be vnpure. The x. chapiter. Know fain he would of God the cause why so he did him strike: He was his woork and handy craft, in fourm wel to be likte. Seeing (said he) I knowe it not, time giue me to repent: He dooth describe the face of death, that makes this life relent. The xi. chapiter. Lo (said Sophar) another freend, what woords this fellowe makes: Uniustly he did Iob accuse, that he was ful of crakes. No measure can of God be had, he knoweth secrets hid: He willeth Iob for to repent, so comfort should proceed. The xii. chapiter. Men riche in worldly welth dispise, bothe God and godlines: Thus then (said Iob) to those that came, to mock his holines. The might of God he dooth describe, to passe all other power: And that no strength can him restst if he begin to lower. The xiii. chapiter. None of you all hath knowledge more (said he) then that I haue: Therfore with God now let me talke, who shall me surely saue. He prayeth God to pardon him, and to absent his ire: So shall he then escape the wrath, of euerlasting fire. The xiiii. chapiter. Of mens short state and misery, and how their dayes be set: Whiche none can passe nor cut therof, his time prolong nor let. And eke how that this world shall end, and men shall blisse then haue: So hope he prooues shall neuer die though men go down to graue. The xv. chapiter. Puft vp with pride said Eliphas, is Iob right wel I see: What knowest thou? what canst thou tel but eke the same can wee? Th'vngodly man he runneth foorth as stiffe as any steel: But God rebukes his sinful way, whiche sharply he dooth feel. The xvi. chapiter. Quenche yee your woords for shame (? Iob) what c?fort call you this? My state and cace on euery side, is far from ioy or blisse. From witting sin by willing mood, his hart and hands were clean: Why he was stroke so greeuously, he musde what God did mean. The xvii. chapiter. Right rufully he shewth his cace, to God that is on hie: And stil rebukes the scornfulnes, of those that stood him by. But vertuous men he dooth commend, for they in vertue growe: He maketh count that he shall die, and down to dust him bow. The xviii. Chapiter. Suche tormentes as the wicked shall abide for their misdeeds: Forsooth Bildah dooth tel to Iob, as iust deserued meeds. Bothe darknes, net, and pit, and snare his house and fame shall die: Suche fee (saith hee) shall sinners haue and telles the cause and why. The xix. chapiter. Ten times said Iob ye haue me vext, what mean yee so to doo? Yee see me spoild on euery side, and ad yee this therto? O fauour me and hear my woords, and write them vp in lead: My sauiour liues whom I shall see, when vp shall rise the dead. The xx. chapiter. When Iob had doon then Suphar spake, and telles the wickeds lot: How that his gain shall home again, whiche he vniustly got. And hauing store yet raking more, stil saying he is poore: He shall not scape the wrath of God when he on him dooth loure. The xxi. chapiter. Ah now (said Iob) hear me a while, and answer to me giue: Why doo the wicked prosper so, and welthy long doo liue? Yet is their end in wretchednes, their God they did blaspheme: At graue the poore shall haue asmuche, as he that rulde a realme. The xxii. chapiter. Be sure of this (said Eliphas,) God wil with thee contend: Thy crueltie to pouertie, hath brought thee to this end. Therfore conuert and turn to God and lay away thy pride: And make thy boon in humblenes, and God shalbe thy guide. The xxiii. chapiter. Can God be hid? no no (said Iob,) I knowe his mercy great: Before, behinde, and on eche side, gainst him may no man pleat. His law and eke his woorthy hests, I haue and wil obay: He dooth his wil, I doo him fear, and so shall doo for ay. The xxiiij. chapiter. Doutles I can but muse to see, the mightie that are riche: How knowing God, they vexe the poore, their crueltie is suche. The poore dooth cry, yet God permits their tiranny to reign: The whorishe hed and wicked man yet surely shalbe slain. The xxv. chapiter. Ending his talke Bildad began, is their not power (said he)? With him abooue whose men of war, can not enumbred be. Comparde with God, no man is iust, can womens birth be pure? When lightes abooue to him are dark, how then shall man indure? The xxvi. chapiter. Ful strength &amp; power hath God aboue said Iob he needs no ayd: The hel so deep is seen to him, the earth by him is staid. The clouds and seas are bound by him, the heauens by him are propt: The Whale so huge moste serpent like, by him his powre is stopt. The xxvii. chapiter. God be my Iudge I wil not speak, of things that shalbe vain: My rightuousnes I wil not leaue for sin shall haue his pain. Look what the wicked dooth increace, the godly shall possesse: And what he had he shall not haue thus wrath shall him so dresse. The xxviij. chapiter. How secret seames out siluer giue, and golde with Iron hard: How precious stones and food for folkes, and men from men be bard. Heer in the earth these things are hid but wisedome hath no peer: Whiche hid from men her for to finde is onely God to fear. The xxix. chapiter. I say to you, O that I were, as I haue been tofore: When power &amp; might was in my hand, and goods I had in store. For euery man gaue me the place, the poor I did defend: And what I said, or what I did all men did me commend. The xxx. chapiter. Knowe you that now the contrary, the vilest doo me mock: They rail they skorn, they laugh, they talke I am their iesting stock. The Lord therto is eke my fo, O God doo me forgiue: For I did help thaflicted man, though now thou doost me greeue. The xxxi. chapiter. Leudly yet look I neuer did, on mayden or on wife: My houshold folke and strangers bothe of me had neuer strife. Hungry and thirstie did I feed, the naked did I clothe: If I haue not delt iustly dole, then let the earth me lothe. The xxxii. Chapiter. Muche musing then said Elihu, vnto his fellowes three: Haue you no more to Iob to say, and you mine elders be? Til you were dasht I beeing yung, I had nothing to say: But fearles now free speeche shall passe, lest God take me away. The xxxiii. chapiter. Note wel my woords (to Iob he said) why saist thou thou art Iust: Rebuke not God what so he dooth for rule hee hath and must. In bed ful sick he dooth vs lay, suche message vs to giue: For to submit and graunt our gilt, then surely shall wee liue. The xxxiiii. Chapiter. O yee that wise and learned be, now further see you mark God dooth not strike but wee deserue, no thought to him is dark. He hath no eye to great or lowe, the riche and poor are like: Yet Iob dooth think him self so iust that God should not him strike. The xxxv. chapiter. Proceeding foorth Elihu said, be thou O Iob vniust: Or be thou iust as thou doost say, yet this is true to trust. That God is ne, the more or lesse made holy or defilde: But if a man on him doo call, he shall finde him ful milde. The xxxvi. Psalme. Quietly hear me yet a while, God dooth not strike for nought: But for to tel and mend our sin, that we tofore haue wrought Bue if they skorn then shall they die, or if the time they track: So great is God, him to beholde, our knowledge is to slack. The xxxvii. Chapiter. Ruling like as a Prince on hie, our God dooth all things guide The storme, the haile, the frost, y? snowe, of him they haue their tide. To punishe lands or them to blesse, O Iob, this is moste true: Alone he guides the things he made, then giue him glory due. The xxxviii. Chapiter. So then the Lord him self did speak to Iob: wast thou said he: When I the heauens &amp; earth did make, of councel then with me? Canst thou ought doo in hie or lowe of wonders that I wrought? Hast thou in waters or in land, the treasures of them sought? The xxxix. chapiter. The Gotes, the Hindes, and Unicorn, their gendring and their force: The Pecock gay and foolishe stork or of the barbed horse. Or of the Hauk that flies by South or of the Egles might: By thy deuice haue these their giftes, to mooue and take their flightes? The xl. chapiter. When Iob had hard what God had said he humbly did obay: And said he had said and would be stil, then foorth the Lord did say. The power and might of Leuiathan, or Behemoth by name. Canst thou him rule with snare or gin, or make him milde and tame? The xli. chapiter. Al men may think his powre is great, though mine it not exceed: Yet what ye make him for to hurt he counts it as a reed His paths are in the mightie sea, all men from him doo slide: The mightie Whale with diuel possest he is the King of pride. The xlii. chapiter. Before the Lord Iob did repent confessing how that he: The wonderous woorks or mightie power of God he could not see. His freends were wild to offer giftes that Iob might for them pray: And God gaue him of all things more then he had ere that day. Thus Iob hath doon his patience, ye haue heard all his broile: How Sathan wrought to turn his faith how freends did him turmoile. Now sporting songs for liuely wits, suche as the Lord doo fear: From Dauids harp the sommary. to you shall wel appear. The Psalmes of Dauid. The first Psalme. A happy hap the man shall haue, whiche not with sinners walks: Ne he that in the wicked chair of God in scorne italks. His frute shalbe moste plenteously, rewarded eke with blisse: When sinners shall decay and fall, of heauenly ioyes to misse. The ii. Psalme. Beware (saith he) how that ye rage, ye rulers all in vain: For God wil haue his sonne to rule, in might and poure to reign. Therfore se that ye couet lore, and serue the Lord in fear: Kisse him in time lest yee doo smart, when he shall once appeer. The iii. Psalme. Cast out of Kingdome, Dauid cryes, to God for ayd and strength: He hath releef, he dooth confesse, God did him hear at length. And surely he hath confidence, that God wil succour send: That he wil strike his enemies, and eke his flock defend. The iiii. Psalme. Dout cast away, he trusted God, though Saule did him molest He checketh all the taunting men, that did his reign detest. And prooueth that the care of God, continually dooth feed: Those that he loues so that they may, take rest and sleep at need. The v. Psalme. Eftsoones in his aduersitie, betime to God he prayes: Affirming God to be ful iust, detesting sinners wayes. Beseeching God to be his guide, describing sinners race: Affirming that God wil protect, the iust in euery place. The vi. Psalme. Ful fraught in feeling God his ire and death to shew his dart: He humbly prayes God to forgiue, and shewes his mourning hart Away (saith he) yee wicked men reeelf now haue I found: My wishers euil shall haue this hap, the Lord shall them confound. The vii Psalme. Giltles now Dauid did complain, false tales to Saule were tolde: He cleeres him self and prayeth God, his cace for to beholde. Affirming that the glory of God, by that should eke be seen: And how the euil in their deuice, shall wast and perishe cleen. The viii. Psalme. How wunderful in all his woorks, is God aboue (saith hee?) Whiche maketh babes to tel his fame and eke the starry skie. But yet of man he museth more, why God should him regard: To knowe the thing he dooth confes. for him it is to hard. The ix. Psalme. I wil giue praise to God (saith he) for victories by past: Who had his foes and their defence, bothe kild and ouer cast. And now that foes doo flowe a freshe, for wonted ayd he calles: The wicked men they were destroyed he meanes that were King Sauls. The x. Psalme. Knowe heer yee may the trade &amp; way, that wicked men do vse: Describing eke their suttleties, the poor for to abuse. He calleth God for to aduenge, the poor sustayning wrong: Beseeching him to breke the arme, of the vngodly throng. The xi. Psalme. Lo though (said he) the wicked bend, their bowe at me to shoot: And though to hilles they bid me flee, and haue me in pursuite. Yet shall the Lord poure down his wrath vpon the wicked rout: And righteous men shall haue his loue of this their is no dout. The xii. Psalme. Men beeing falne from equitie, Gods help hee dooth desire: And that he would cut out the tungs, of eche flattering lier. For needies sake the Lord wil rise, and set the bond ful free: Gods woords are pure when wicked reign it is a shame to see. The xiii. Psalme. Now vexed sore with sundry sauts, prest ready to dispair: His anker olde he flees vnto, to God he makes his prayer. And lest his foes incouragde should be: for to see his fall: He hauing ayd dooth hight him lauds that reigneth ouer all. The xiiii. Psalme. Of foolishe men that inwardly, doo say there is no God: Describe he dooth their propertie, and eke their fatall rod. For mocking of the poores deuice, he dooth also request: The thraldome of the Israelites, that it might turn to rest. The xv. Psalme. Peculiarly now dooth he tel, why God did take and chuse: Of his good wil into his house, the people of the Iewes. Forsooth because that they should shew, to suche as were without: By godly life that they were Gods to bring them out of dout. The xvj. Psalme. Questionles not for his woorks but for his faith alone: He prayeth God him to preserue, els succour hath he none. Idolatrie hee dooth detest, true worship dooth he like: Affirming that his soule shall not be left in grauy dike. The xvii. Psalme. Rehearse hee dooth the crueltie, of Saule and eke his men: The raging pride and tiranny, they shewd vnto him then. Without desertes, therfore he prayes, reuenge of God to haue: His giltles life to Saule was suche, that makes him so to craue. The xviii. Psalme. Sith God (saith he) hath stablisht me, and set me in my throne: For mercies great &amp; sauegard bothe to him he praies alone. The kingdome of our Lord and Christe, the whiche shall haue none end: He saith, shall stand spite of the foes, so God shall him defend. The xjx. Psalme. Lo the intent the mighty power, of God might wel be waid: The heauens and might of lightes aboue, by them he is displaid. Besides all this his sacred woord, and law that is so pure: He dooth set out as perfet guide, to walke therby ful sure. The xx. Psalme. When that the King in warlike wise, should go to Ammons hoste: The people pray God to defend, their King and eke their coste. And that the giftes and sacrifice, whiche offer vp he did: That God would them accept and like, before that foorth he yed. The xxi. Psalme. As soon as Dauid home returnd, from victory in feeld: In voice of all he thanked God, whiche made his foes to yeeld. Affirming that the Lord alone, had giuen his foes the foile And that he would stil on so doo, though they ne so turmoile. The xxii. Psalme. Brought now into extremities and hope allmost decaid: Yet hauing faith and found releef, again him self he stayd. And by him self he dooth describe, what should in time to come: When Christe should be vpon the earth, gainst him what should be doon? The xxiii. Psalme. Caused by sundry succours past, the Lord he takes for guide: And hauing him for his defence, he cares not what betide. And seeing rest before his foes, the Lord did to him giue: He dooth not dout before he goes, ful long and safe to liue. The xxiiii. Psalme. Doutles though God dooth gouern all, yet cheefly he dooth chuse: Suche as doo liue in godly life, and wickednes refuse. The Gentile and the Iew are like if they obay his lore: Their gates and doores of hartes &amp; minds, must subiect him before. The xxv. Psalme. Eftsoones as often eke before, with foes a freshe opprest: He counts his sinnes to be the cause, and makes to God request. His youthful sinnes for to remit, and to regard his cace: With mercy and with fauour bothe, to him to turn his face. The xxvi. Psalme. Ful many were his enemies, and iniuries assaid: That Saule vniustly to him shewd, he praith to God for ayd. Affirming that although he were from house of God exilde: If he returnd with slaughters great, his aulters should be pilde. The xxvii. Psalme. God is my light and sauegard bothe said hee: and my defence: Bereft from foes this I require, it is my whole pretence. His temple to beholde and see, to dwel therin for ay: His face to vew his wayes to learn, so faith hath been my stay. The xxviii. Psalme. Heuines now his hart besets, to see the wicked rout: Desiring to be rid of them, and wrath to root them out. He prayseth God who is his strength and heard when he dooth call: His hart therfore was ful of ioy, and prayeth defence fro all. The xxix. Psalme. In power suche as doo rule and reign, (if God) to be they wunder: Then he them willes to learn his might by tempest and by thunder. And though by them he sinners feares, and makes them all to quake: Yet wil he saue his chosen flock, euen for his mercies sake. The xxx. Psalme. Knowe did he wel deliuerance, from God aboue to come: He renders laudes eke for the same he shewes him self not dum. The suden fall from liking state, and eke for mercies stil: Hee dooth declare and prayeth God, his praise set out he wil. The xxxi. Psalme. Laudes and praise yet once again, for freedome from his thrall By faith in hope he giues to God, affirming this withall. That God with fauour dooth beholde, those that him loue and fear: Preseruing them continually, as samples doo appeer. The xxxii. Psalme. Maruaylous sick he dooth confesse, his sin to be the cause: And blest to whom God not imputes the breaking of his lawes. And after thus his faultes confest, the wicked he exhorts: To mend their life and holy men, with ioyes he muche comfortes. The xxxiii. Psalme. Now righteous men reioice saith he, in him that vs did make: And gouerns all and is ful true, his graunt shall neuer slake. He sercheth hartes and knoweth thoughtes no secrets from him hid: No help can saue but his right hand trust this, he dooth you bid. The xxxiiii. Psalme. Of fear and dread he beeing rid, whom Achis counted mad: He thanketh God who was the cause that good successe he had. And so prouokes that godly men, should stil in God put trust: Affirming wicked slaughters great, and sauegard for the iust. The xxxv. Psalme. Plead thou my cause o God (saith he,) gainst Saule and eke his court: Their traps they set, me for to catche, let them turn to their hurt. And saue thou me and also those, that giltles take my part: And I shall praise thy holy name, so long as liues my hart. The xxxvi. Psalme. Quite gon from fear of God are those that followe wicked trace: The gouernnaunce of God in earth, dooth ioy his woful cace. And so muche more he holdes that God his chosen shall preserue: Who finally shall them defend, and punishe those that swarue. The xxxvii. Psalme. Reck not (saith he) nor doo you fret that wicked men doo thriue: Nor that thou seest the iust correct, for thou shalt see beliue. How that the euil, ofcut shalbe, and thou, if thou abide: Ful patiently shalt haue thy wishe, when that thy cause is tride. The xxxviii. Psalme. Sicknes eftsoones dooth cause him say, his sinnes the same to bring: The ire of God, and freend now fled, with foes on him laughing. Is cause that he intreateth God, to make him whole again: And firmly stands to trust to that, and so dooth stil remain. The xxxix. Psalme. Tempted then with extremities and greefs that were infirme: Eke fully bent this patience, with silence to confirme. Yet burst he out with doleful woords, and dumnes quite he left: Beseeching him of speedy help, that he be not bereft. The xl. Psalme. When perils past were passed by, he rendreth thanks to God: And telleth plain he wil set out, suche things as he hath bod. Stil crauing mercy at his hand, and foile on foes to fall: With wishing those that doo him fear his prays to render all. The xli. Psalme. Afflicted sore yet dooth he blesse, those that his cace lament: Complayning muche of fayned freends that traytourously were bent. But feeling God to be his ayd, his haters rage to stay: He rendreth thanks and dooth protest, he wil doo so for ay. The xlii. Psalme. Beeing exilde from Christes flock, to praise his holy name: Yet dooth he ful protest a while, from hart to doo the same. Affirming though aduersities, had ne so him opprest: Yet should his soule haue confidence in him to take her rest. The xliii. Psalme. Causles his foes did vexe him sore therfore to God he prayes: Iudge thou my cause and be my light, thus vnto God he sayes. So by that meanes vnto thy hil, and tabernacle bothe: Upon my harp I wil thee thank, my soule shall not it lothe. The xliiii. Psalme. Due thanks his people heer doo giue, for mercies manifolde: And feeling now the contrary, Gods couenant they beholde. Affirming that to be the cause, why enemies them vexe: Yet doo they vow his lawes to holde for all their wicked checks. The xlv. Psalme. Extolled is the maiestie, of Salomon the King: The Egipt wife that he did wed, hath eke her extolling. Wherby is shewd how the Gentiles to Christe shall spoused be: His mercies large shall foorth so stretche, that none refuse wil he. The xlvi. Psalme. For help receiu'd beeing besiegd, of King Sennacherib: The land, the Lord affirming so, it shalbe stablished. In putting trust in God alwayes, who hath his whole delight: To saue his Churche when succour all, dooth seem to be gone quite. The xlvii. Psalme. God that is of moste mightie power, he willeth for to laud: Whose kingly rule dooth make his foes, that they by him be awd. Who dooth also to Iacobs seed, extend his lasting looue: He telles before the Gentiles call, by Christe that is abooue. The xlviii. Psalme. How notably Hierusalem, from sundry foes had ayd: How that from God their force was such they could not be dismaid. For whiche, to God they render thanks as guide vnto their dittie: And so describe the comely state, of their moste noble Cittie. The xlix. Psalme. Incline your eares (saith he) &amp; hark, iudge not that suche as welth Haue in their hands, that they be blest for sure it is but pelf. And they shall passe and perishe all, that haue therin their trust: But God shall feed and saue in deed, suche as in him are iust. The l. Psalme. Knowing ful wel how that the church of Ipocrites had store: Who put their trust in outward showes more then in inward lore. Whiche hee dooth check and telleth plain, that God dooth more delight: In inward thanks and due requestes then sacrifices bright. The li. Psalme. Lo pardon now, he pleadeth for, the King (I mean) when hee: By Nathans mouth did knowe his fault, haue mercy Lord on me. He saith, and blot out all mi gilt, and put away my sinne: And doo not strike my people for, the fault that I fel in. The lii. Psalme. Muche musing why that wicked man, that Doeg had to name: Should boste him self so in his pride, he saith God shall him tame. And then he willes that faithful men, should not suche tirants fear: But stand in trust of Gods defence, who shall their quarels bear. The liii. Psalme. No God at all the fool dooth say, there is to see my fact: God looking down espied none, that did regard his act, Wherfore with fear they shalbe flight, where fear there is no need: But sauing state with ioyfelnes, his flock shall haue in deed. The liiii. Psalme. O God (hee saith) doo thou me saue with enemies opprest: And by thy power iudge thou my cause, gainst suche as me detest. Then wil I praise thy holy name, and sacrifice ordain: When of my foes my ful request, of thee I doo obtain. The lv. Psalme. Persecuted so stil by Saule, for succour he dooth pray: Muche greeued with a flattring sort, that sought him to betray. Moste ardently beseeching God, his pittie for to shew: And carefulnes he willeth men, vpon the Lord to throwe. The lvi. Psalme. Questionles he seeth no way, his foes for to withstand: But forst he was to walke astray, to voyd his enmies hand. Wherfore he praith moste humblely to him that prayer alowes: To way his cause and him defend so wil he pay his vowes: The lvii. Psalme. Restles again to God he calles for mercy at his need: Also when Saule he might haue slain, he dooth not so in deed. But prayeth God abooue the heauens, his glory to set out: And he in hart wil praise the Lord with musick there about. The lviii. Psalme. Saule now is heer described out, his flatterers also: Who sought alwayes by day and night, to turn him vnto wo. Shewing how that he dooth appeal, to God to hear the right: Affirming that his wrath on them, shall cause men praise his might. The lix. Psalme. To God again for help he cryes, in bed he was beset: He telles their tales and gileful ginnes, deuisde him for to get. Protesting that God wil them kil though sparde they be a while: And then ful bent to laud the Lord, his song he wil compile. The lx. Psalme. When Dauid was in Kingly seat, eset and crowned King: Then he protest vnto his flock, that it was Gods working. Saying if they alow the same, God shall stil them defend: And valiant actes again their foes, he shall vnto them send. The lxi. Psalme. Absalon now and Ammonite, doo freshe reuiue his care: With doleful cry he prayeth God his help for to declare. And beeing stayd in quiet throne, as oft before he sayes: That he wil pay his vowed vow, and sing vnto his praise. The lxii. Psalme. Beset with sore temptations, his faith to prooue and try: He vseth meditations, to him that is on hie. Affirming eke the vanitie, of worldlings in their wele: And willeth vs to liue in God, who shall our deeds reuele. The lxiii. Psalme. Comfort he did receiue of God, in Ziph that wildernes: Where Saule had him beset so sore, that great was his distresse. And so releeud, he thanketh muche, the Lord omnipotent: And telles before the death of Saule, as afterward it went. The lxiiii. Psalme. Dauid dooth pray that suche as doo, of him make false reporte: That God would strike them sudenly, euen after the same sorte. That they had thought him for to haue with arrowes sharp and fearce: So shall all those, that it beholde, his mightie woork reherce. The lxv. Psalme. Extolled praise dooth Sion giue, for graces manifolde: His people by the same is ment, whiche are within his folde. How specially he did them chuse, and gouern them by might: And blest their land with plentiousnes and ceasnably it dight. The lxvi. Psalme. For prayses now to men he calles, that they should giue to God: And shewth his power to make the euil, to fear his ireful rod. And how that God from time to time, his people had protect: And saued him who promise makes his aulters to be dect. The lxvii. Psalme. God merciful to be to them, this Psalme dooth him beseeche: His countenance and iudgement bothe, with prayses in their speeche. And how they swarm vpon the earth, that then of laudes were doon: Should praise his name vnder his blisse, when Christe to reign should come. The lxviii. Psalme. How mightely from time to time, God had his people saued: By many wayes and sundry meanes from them that gainst them raued. Wherby by reason of his grace, and helps, wherof no nomber: That on his Churche he dooth bestowe, he telles for mickle wonder. The lxix. Psalme. In great distresse with feruent zeal, to God for help he calles: The cruel wrath of wicked men, and what on them befalles. As Iudas and the like to him, that should his Lord betray: And how the seed of Christes Churche, should bide and liue for ay. The lxx. Psalme. Knowe wel he did that God alone, in daunger must him ayd: Wherfore he prayes his speedy help, as he before had praid. And that his foes might back be turnd, and so receiue their shame: But ioyfulnes to light on his, to praise his holy name. The lxxi. Psalme. Like as before in faith he makes, his prayer in promise fixt: Whiche from his youth to hoary age, in all his life was mixt. His foes their fall he dooth beseeche, and graces to him bent: Stil to remain and so wil he, praise him on instrument. The lxxii. Psalme. Make prayer he dooth that Salomon his sonne may wisely raign: In prosperous state as figure erst, of Christe irose again. That peace and plentie he should bring and Kings kneel him before: And all the lands vpon the earth, should laud him euermore. The lxxiii. Psalme. Neyther the wicked welthy state of suche as be reiect: Nor yet the broyle of suche as be his chosen and elect. Should cause the godly to dispair, but Gods forsight to loue: He shewes the end of good and bad, his liking is aboue. The lxxiiij. Psalme. Oprest they were with raging force religion true defaste: The temple and the seruice bothe tofore that was in braste. Wherfore to God for ayd they cry, his couenant to beholde: And for his name his flock to saue his foes eke so controlde. The lxxv. Psalme. Perpetuall prayse the faithful giue, to God their Iudge and King: Who righteously the world shall Iudge, at time of his comming. Of setting vp or putting down, all power is in his hand: His foes as dregs shall drink his wrath. vpright the iust shall stand. The lxxvi. Psalme. Quite quailed was the Assirians poure Gods name therby was knowne Sennacheribs hoste Gods Angel slue, his brags were ouerthrowne. At his rebuke and Iudgement fierce the rayling rout was stayd: Suche vowes therfore as they had plight he willes they should be paid. The lxxvii. Psalme. Refuge in fear of Saule his foe, he knew none but his God: Therfore with voice to him he flies though vnderneath his rod. In halfe dispair and woful greef, yet vewing Gods great might: He cheereth vp him self again, by meruails wrought in sight. The lxxviii. Psalme. Suche succour as the Lord had sent, the Israelites to fore: He telles and yet how they rebeld, and lou'de him nere the more. And yet how God forbare his hand, to see if they would mend: When nought preuaild saue Iudah sole, he chose none to defend. The lxxix. Psalme. Tormoild the Iewes with Gentiles were to God they call for ayd: To kil their foes to saue their liues so vnto him they prayed. For whiche his help to celebrate, his laudes they doo protest: From time to time they and their stock, should there vnto be prest. The lxxx. Psalme. Uncessantly to God they flee, as pastour of his sheep: From foes to saue they him besought, whiche had them made to weep. From Egipt land his vine he brought, the bore did it anoy: They him beseeche with power from hie the beast for to destroy. The lxxxi. Psalme. A law was made for musick men, when sacrifice was made: That they should play, he them so willes to keep them in their trade. And God he brings to speak to them, and what for them he did: What eke he willes that they should doo, but stil amis they yeed. The lxxxii. Psalme. Beholde of this amid the rout, of Iudges God dooth sit: To cause them fear, no wrong to doo, lest they doo smart for it. And though their names be nere so great, if Iustice they doo misse: As men ful mean they perishe shall, let them be sure of this. The lxxxiii. Psalme. Complain they did of neighbour foe beseeching God of ayd: The wickeds talke they doo expresse, what they of them haue said. Beseeching God them to destroy, like others them before: So forcing foes to knowe his might and fear it euermore. The lxxxiiii. Psalme. Dauid was driuen by Absalon, from Sion and his seat: Dooth shew his zeale vnto Gods house, and so he dooth intreat. Affirming rather in the Churche a door keeper to be: Then in the tentes of wicked men, to haue a hie degree. The lxxxv. Psalme. Exilde they were as captiue men, but now returnd from thrall The peoples sinnes they are remit, God hath forgiuen them all. So thanks he giues an prophesieth, their helth, their ioy and faith: Their goodnes, iustice, and their peace all this tofore he saith. The lxxxvi. Psalme. For hapful hearing of the Lord, the Prophet now dooth pray: For help, for ayd, for ioyful signe, he prayes not to denay. Against all suche as sought his wo, this prayer did he make: That God is far aboue all Gods, he dare wel vndertake. The lxxxvii. Psalme. Glory ful great and founded sure, to Sion dooth he giue: The Churche of Christ in constant faith whiche heer on earth dooth liue. No churche there is of might so great, not Babilon in deed: The mighty monarks of the earth, shee far dooth them exceed. The lxxxviii. Psalme. Humblenes in affliction, this Psalme dooth tend therto: In sicknes time and great distresse, so Dauid vsde to doo. With doleful cheer and woful care, all comfortles he cries: As dead in graue and darknes deep no help that he espies. The lxxxix. Psalme. In endles wise sing praise he wil, to God that is abooue: For his great goodnes and his faith shewd to him in his looue. In keeping promise to his tribe, of whom the Lord was borne: Whose Kingdome eke and stablenes he telles of, long beforn. The xC. Psalme. Knowe heer ye may th'eternitie, of God all worlds before: And of mans life the breuitie, for watching wholesome lore. Of miseries and shorted life, our sinnes are cause of all: For ioyes he prayth in time to come, that they may be equall. The xCi. Psalme. Lo, lo (saith hee) who so dooth dwel vnder the Lords defence: What so betide he need not care, from where or eke from whence. His faith and hope that pends on God, so firme is set and sure: That nothing can him hurt or noy, but safe he shall endure. The xCii. Psalme. Muche good it is to celebrate, he saith to God on hie: His goodnes and his faithfulnes, with song and melody. His woorks or goodnes, wicked men, doo nothing knowe at all: But godly men in knowledge growe and so for ay they shall. The xCiii. Psalme. None dooth reign but God alone, who made the things are made: By whiche his glory and his might are seen as in a shade. His law also vnto a flock, he gaue to learn him more: And midst of them he gaue him self to fortify his lore. The xCiiii. Psalme. Opprest wel neer with mightie foes, for vengeance he dooth craue: Beseeching, sherching, finding fault, as though his fleshe did raue. But finding help he giues the laud, to God his sole defence: And ful his hope he sets in him, who shall him recompence. The xCv. Psalme. People slack he calleth foorth, with double call he calles: To laud the Lord he made the sea the earth and hilles as walles. He is our God and pastour eke, his voice if we neglect: His rest we shall not see no more, then those that were reiect. The lxxxxvi. Psalme. Quite ouer all to all he cryes, to sing and laud the Lord: Who passeth all the Gods on earth none can with him accord. He telles before of Christe his reign how large that it shall stretche: He comes, he comes, so tel it foorth, to Gentiles shall he fetche. The lxxxxvii. Psalme. Reign dooth the Lord, therfore the earth let it reioyce &amp; Iles And dasht be Gentiles and their Gods that woorship then their whiles. But as for Sion let it ioy, and doo the thing is good: For light vpsprings let iust reioyce, with laudes of cheerful mood. The lxxxxviii. Psalme. Sing now saith he, a song anew, vnto the Lord abooue: Who maruelously hath shewd him self, to suche as doo him looue. Therfore he willes that all the earth should praise and laud him stil: For he shall come with Iustice right to Iudge after his wil. The lxxxxix. Psalme. Triumphantly the Lord dooth reign, the people fret and fume: Let earth be moou'd and moou'd again, with fretting to presume. Yet shall the Lord rule ouer all, and hear the iusts request: Therfore set out his holy name, towards hie where he dooth rest The C. Psalme. Unto the laud and praise of God he stirreth all that come: Suche as into his court approche, he would not haue them dum. The causes why that mooues therto he saith to be that hee: Did fourm our shape, we did not so his goodnes makes the glee. The Ci. Psalme. A that Princes and Prelates eke would learn this Psalme by rote: For publike weal and churchely rule, here is a godly note. That none in Court or Kirk should be that gaue them selues to euil: And those should be prefard alone, as made of sinne a driuel. The Cii. Psalme. Beholding great calamities, with double speeche he cryes: To hear his sute, to way his cause to him aboue the skies. That he would consolation send, to him was graunt his sute: Posterities may knowe therof, by publike fame and brute. The C.iii. Psalme. Celebrate to God abooue, and eke his name extol: He counselleth his inward powers, by meaning of his soule. For kindenes shewd to him and his so forst he was to doo: Bothe Angels might and ministers, he willeth eke therto. The C.iiii. Psalme. Dedicate his soule to blesse, again the Lord he willes: Who lightsome glory putting on, rules far abooue the hilles. That God made all in parts he telles and eke his flock dooth cherishe: By guyding some and feeding some or els they all should perishe. The C.v. Psalme. Euery one for to confesse, the Lord and him to pray: He willeth so and that they should set out his lauds alway. For wunders that he wrought tofore, ful many yeeres ere than: He breefly telles to mean therto, beginning at Abram. The C.vj. Psalme. Ful often as before so heere, he willes for to confesse: The goodnes of the Lord so great to folke that were thankles. Who were vnfaithful murmurers, transgressours and rebels. Deseruing muche but yet the Lord, his pact he not refels. The Cvii. Psalme. Go on he dooth as twice before, to set out God as good: Not onely to the Israelites. as in a partiall mood. But also vnto all the world, bothe comforter and scourge: For whiche he wil to God the laudes among them all to forge. The Cviii. Psalme. Haue heer you shall the fiftie seuen, and sixtie Psalme in one: As laudes and praise to God aboue that vanquished their sone. With wishing that the glory of God might rule in euery coste: Of Israels far stretching out, so telles the holy Ghoste. The C.ix. Psalme. In vehement sprite he praith to God, to aduenge him on his foes: As Doeg in the court and suche, that wrought him many woes. By flattering talke in foule wise, to please the eares of Saule: They tolde to him a thousand lies so heaping Dauids thrall. The C.x. Psalme. King Dauid heer of Christe dooth tel, as Christe him self dooth say: His royall kingdome he sets out, to dure bothe now and ay. His preesthood eke not Aaron like, but as Melchizadeck: Triumphantly his rule shalbe, all subiect to his beck. The C.xj. Psalme. Look what the Lord had promised to Israel long ago: From captiuenes to set them free he saith that he did so. And gaue to them the Gentiles land and eke his holy law: Thus he them telles to stir them vp, to haue the same in awe. The C.xii. Psalme. Muche good he saith shall light to him, that hath the Lord in fear: And dooth delight to keep his wil, blest shall that man appeer. To poor and weak he giueth ayd, remoou'de he shall not bee: Although the wicked chafe therat, when they the same shall see. The C.xiii. Psalme. Nought els he willes but laud &amp; praise to God aboue to giue: Whiche looketh down from hie aboue, on things that heer doo liue. And dooth from dust set vp the poore, with princes for to sit: And makes the barren frute to haue and to reioyce in it. The C.xiiii. Psalme. Of Gods behauiour towards his flock when Egipt they went out: Now mountains, hilles, and waters low from order turnd about All fearing muche the face of God he saith this came to passe: And stony rock to water flud, by him so turned was. The C.xv. Psalme. Putting all glory quite away, from Idolles fayned Gods: Twixe whom and God that is the Lord, he prooueth great the ods. Not vnto vs, not vnto vs, but God haue all the praise: Who owes the heau?, &amp; guides the earth his name be blest alwayes. The C.xvi. Psalme. Qu?che they could not but that he would looue God that heard his cry: When Absalon did vexe him sore, and caused him to flie. Yet hopes he wel for to return, Hierusalem to pay: The vowes that he to God did vow, when he was driuen away. The C.xvii. Psalme. Right as before so heer again, he willeth nations all: To laud the Lord that as he reigne, so euermore he shall. Confirming his benignitie, and faith by Christe his sonne: From time to time withouten end, as he it once begun. The C.xviii. Psalme. So God alone he dooth confesse, because that he is good: The Israelites he willes therto, as he that sau'de their blood. From Philistines and other foes, that did against them bark: And gaue them rest to laud the Lord, and to set vp his Ark. The C.xix. Psalme. Though it be long yet in a some, this Psalme dooth say thus muche: That study of the law of God, there is no study suche. Sometimes he speaks eke of his foes, and some also he threates: These three are cheef in matters all, that in this songs he treates. The C.xx. Psalme. Unto suche tungs as vse to lie, and eke for to backbight: He could not wishe suche sharp reward, as due to them was right. For peaceles men and flatterers, suche as with Saule did court: Kept him exilde and yet therto, they wrought him mickle hurt. The C.xxi. Psalme. At God alone all ayd is had, on him must we depend: For he that made the heauen and earth, shall succour to vs send, Who stil dooth watche with open eyes, and neuer more dooth sleep: No hurt can come vnto his Churche, for he dooth stil it keep. The C.xxii. Psalme. Brought vp when that the ark of God was to Hierusalem: He was ful glad to hear consent, of all his people then. And seeing Iustice like to reign, he wisheth ceasse of warres: And peace to florishe in her streetes and round about the barres. The C.xxiii. Psalme. Caused were some this psalme to make whiche for their godlines: Were mockt &amp; scornd, and taunted eke, of men in wickednes. They wait as maids vpon their dames, and tend vpon the Lord: Beseeching mercy at his hand, though others at them boord. The C.xxiiii. Psalme. Double (he sayth) vnles that God, had been on Israels side: Moste certainly by forren foes, it had with them been wide. For quick they had deuoured them, as flud they had ore run: They blesse the Lord that made al thing from whom all help dooth come. The C.xxv. Psalme. Eche one that in the Lord dooth trust, shalbe as Sion mount: For why the Lord shalbe with him, he may thereof account. But godly men with wicked men, shall not be mixt in one: And suche as turn vnto their euils, they shalbe wo be gone. The C.xxvi. Psalme. Ful ioyful shall the captiues be, when home they doo return: And Sion shall for ioy then laugh, and make an end to moorn. And Gentiles shall report and say, that God hath greatly doon: For suche as out with teares did go with songs they shall home come. The C.xxvii. Psalme. Gone vnto nought is all the woork bestowe you nere the cost: Except the Lord doo build the house, the labour is but lost. It is in vain to watche at all, vnlesse the Lord doo wake: The early rising shall not help, God, fruteful shall thee make. The C.xxviii. Psalme. How happy he shalbe he telth, that alwayes God dooth fear His handy labour he shall eat, his wife him frute shall bear. With Sion in his prosperitie, and eke Hierusalem: He shall beholde and Gransire be and Israels peace yken. The C.xxix. Psalme. In cheerful wise may Israel say, often times they haue Me fought against: euen from my youth, But God he did me saue. Confounded shall the plowers be, that plowd vpon my back: And all that Sion once did hate, their power shalbe but slack. The C.xxx. Psalme. King Dauid as some men suppose, beeing sore vext of Saule: Out of the depth vnto the Lord, he did bothe cry and call. Beseeching him for to forgiue, his sinnes and set him free: The Israelites some think it made, in their captiuitie. The C.xxxi. Psalme. Lifted aloft his hart is not, ne yet his eyes with pride: Nor yet in things passing his reache, he hath not walkt aside. But hath his soule as nurced childe, kept stil in perfet awe: And willeth them to wait for him the authour of their law. The C.xxxii. Psalme. Men may suppose this Psalme to be, made of King Salomon: Beseeching God his fathers broyles that he would think theron. Who once had vowd a house to make, for God therin to shade: And how that preestes and people eke, should ioy to see it made. The C.xxxiii. Psalme. Note and beholde how good it is, breethern in peace to dwel: Like Aarons beard anointed fair, it hath a plesant smel. And as the dewes that fall from hie dooth make the earth increace: So God shall make his blessing fall, on seekers of his peace. The C.xxxiiii. Psalme. O all ye seruantes of the Lord, sing prayses to his name: Yee that attend vpon his house, ceasse not to doo the same: To lift vp hands on hie to him, and eke the Lord to praise: So shall the Lord vs blesse again, who made bothe night and dayes. The C.xxxv. Psalme. Perfourm ye lauds vnto the Lord, that Iacobs house did chuse: He passeth all the Gentiles Gods, the God I mean of Iewes. Who out of Egipt led his flock, and gaue them Canaan: The dummy Gods are painted out, and God is blessed than. The C.xxxvi. Psalme. Quenche not your zeal but stil confes, that God is God for ay: And that his mercy dooth indure, for euer and a day. For all his woorks that he hath made we haue good cause therto: And for his priuate benefites, that he hath shewd to you. The C.xxxvii. Psalme. Right rufully a song they sung, sitting in Babilon: Expressing eke the tauntes of them, that looked them vpon. Beseeching God them to reward, that did them so anoy: And blesseth them that Babilon, shall hap for to destroy. The C.xxxviii. Psalme. Suche goodnes as he found of God, in troubles and in need: He dooth intend to celebrate, to giue him all the meed. Before the great he wil not shrink, they shall not make him dum: In midst of foes for help he hopes, yea, in the time to come. The C.xxxix. Psalme. To God there is nothing vnknowne bothe thoughtes, and woordes, &amp; deedes: He seeth all as creatour, and so stil must he needs. There is no way to scape his hands, he made him by his might: For wicked men he praith the end, and him to guide aright. The C.xl. Psalme. Unlose me Lord to God (he saith,) from wicked mens deuice: Who with their tungs doo me belye, and seek my life to trise. But God his God he dooth so make, that little dooth he care: And knowes that God to help the iust it is not to him rare. The C.xli. Psalme. As he among the wicked dwelt within the Courtes of Saule: He prayeth God that he doo not, suche sin as they in fall. And that he would preserue him eke, and saue him from their ginnes And if he light within their snares, that he may break their grinnes. The C.xlii. Psalme. Being close hid with in a caue, for fear of Saule his foe: He praith to God in his distresse, to saue and help him so. That out of darknes as a naile, he would his soule out take: And so his prayers beeing heard, the iust his part should take. The C.xliii. Psalme. Call vnto God again he dooth, as one opprest with foes: As one whose soule and spirite also, was set with many woes. To hear him and deliuer him, and eke to teache his way: And him to saue for his names sake, thus dooth his seruant pray. The C.xliiii. Psalme. Dauid heer dooth now mixe his Psalme, with thanks for foes opprest: Affirming man and all his dayes to be but vain and prest. To passe away as dooth a shade, then dooth he God intreat: His other foes for to suppresse, and make his quiet seate. The C.xlv. Psalme. Euen as before ful often times so heer he dooth declare: The maruels of the mightie God, how wonderful they are. His goodnes and his clemency, his mercy and his might: How things that wait on him for food, he feedeth them ful right. The C.xlvi. Psalme. Ful plesantly this himne and three that doo the same sucseed: Dooth set out prayses to the Lord, with mouth and minde in deed. Forbidding confidence to put, in any princes might: But trust the maker of the heauens, that giues the blinde his sight. The C.xlvii. Psalme. Go foorth he dooth and willeth lauds, Hierusalem to make: Whiche mightely did woork for it and stil her parte did take. Stil filling her with benefits, and Sion eke therto: The like to others did hee not, as he did them vnto. The C.xlviii. Psalme. Heer dooth he wil the Angels hie, and all the powers aboue: With fier, depth, and Dragons great, and all things that dooth mooue. Bothe heat &amp; colde, bothe yung and olde the people and their King: The mountaines, trees, &amp; creeping beastes all lauds to him to sing. The C.xlix. Psalme. In this his Psalme he dooth exhort, the Israelites to praise: Their God and King with instrumentes, his people doo him please. He telth also that they shall ioy, in victory to come: On Gentiles and their Kings therto, suche ioy shall light on some. The C.l. Psalme. Knit vp he dooth his psalmes with this that suche as musick vse: Their instruments to laud the Lord, they should them therfore chuse. Exhorting all that breatheth breath, to laud and doo the same: And so with this he makes an end, praise yee his holy name. FINIS. Thus ended are the Psalmes in course, an hundreth fortie ten: In songs as they deuided are, I mean the sum of them. And if in place some woord or line, or verse be out of frame: Yet bear with me, Iudge my good wil, and gladly mend the fame. And freend or foe that shall me tel, by any maner wise: VVhere I haue mist miscanning right, not vsing meeter guise. I shall right gladly giue mine ear, to harken to his talke: And with my pen I wil be sure, his councel not to balke. Now perfect Prouerbs followe next, of Salomon the King: VVho so his rules they doo obserue, good life they shall him bring. The sum and pith of all the law of God the Lord is heer: And perfet maners who so list, to learn let him come neer. And listen wel and giue his minde, to print them in his hart: VVith life therto whiles he dooth liue so shall he wel depart. FINIS. The Prouerbs of Salomon. The j. chapiter. A man that wisedome wil attain, to doo all things aright: To fear the Lord he must begin, though fooles not so delight. Cast not thy lot in sinners life, their tising woords refuse: Wisedome she cryes in open streetes but few her lore wil vse. The ii. chapiter. Bend thy self vnto wisedoms wil, as shee dooth thee perswade: And shee wil teache thee perfet skil, to walke a godly trade. From God shee comes he dooth her giue, who dooth preserue the iust: And wisdome had within thy hart, in goodnes shalt thou lust. The iii. chapiter. Consider wel the law of God, and binde thee to the same: Thy trust, thy fear, and honour bothe, let them be in his name. If he correct, doo thou obay, seek wisedome and haue ease: Doo thou no wrong ne seek thou strife for suche doo God displease. The iiii. chapiter. Decline thou not from wisedoms rule shee shall thee woorship bring But in the way that wicked walke, vse not for any thing. The righteous way stil more dooth shine, the wicked walke in dark: His woords and rules to wholesome life, he would that we should mark. The v. chapiter. Euen as experience had him taught, the end of whorishe life: He telth and shewes what euil shall fall, on him that leaues his wife. Exhorting man to rest him self, with her that is his owne: And not to giue his strength and good, to them that are vnknowne. The vj. chapiter. For suretiship a lesson good, for sluggards eke the samee Sixe things are hated of the Lord the seuenth abhorres by name. He wilth vs listen to the lore, that God in Churche dooth tel: So shall we scape the wanton look of whores that leads to hel. The vii. chapiter. Good councel giuen he wilth to take, and eke therto to cleaue: By whiche we shall attain to knowe, how harlots wayes to leaue. Apelles neuer so could paint, a whore in coullours braue: As he describes her trayning tricks, whiche leadeth vnto graue. The viii. Chapiter. He dooth describe how wisedome cryes, and vttereth her voice: How excellent her riches is, so gainful is her choice. Shee passeth Golde and Siluer eke, before all things shee was: In making things shee was with God by her came all to passe. The ix. chapiter. In comely wise hath wisdome built, an house and made a feast: And called folks vnto her fare, but scorners at her gest. The fear of God of wisedome is, the first beginning race: The foolishe woman shewes her self, in euery common place. The x. chapiter. King Salomon his parables, fiue hundreth sixtie ten: In twentie chapters dooth appeer, ful feat to teache all men. Whiche so doo shift and matters change, almost in euery line: That in these staues to set them out, no man can doo in rime. The xxx. chapiter. Lo humble men se that you learn, what Agur heer dooth say: That God his woord you holde therto and ad ne take away. He praith to God that riche nor poore, but meanly he may liue: He tells of things are neuer ful, and wunderous things that meue. The xxxi. Chapiter. Men may heer learn of chastitie, and Iustice eke the way: For whom that wine &amp; drink ful strong is meet and in what day. And for that wife that list to liue, vprightly in this vale: Let her heer read of Lamuel to him his mothers tale. FINIS. Thus Salomon hath tolde his tale, ful wisely in his book: And if you muse why I so short, in hand his Prouerbs took. You shall perceiue that after that, ten Chapters ye haue red: He dooth so chaunge in Adagies, and sentences so shed. That euery line vnto him self, a perfet staffe would haue: So should I not in eyght contain, a Chapter so to saue. Then vnderstand that after nine, to thirtie I doo leap: VVho list to haue of sayings sage, twixt bothe he may them reap. So then before, though that you see, eleuen the figure set: Yet the thirtie Chapter after, in it these things ye get. And then the last is thirtie one. though twelue the figure bear: So of the Prouerbs last of all, the Chapters endeth there. Now shall you haue him preache to you, a sermon ful of lore: VVho so it reads and marks it wel, shall make but little store Of goods or lands, of fame or name of knowledge or of might: Of plesures, plants, and buildings eke, he shall haue small delight. The book of the Preacher. The i. Chapiter. All things is ful of vanitie, the precher heer dooth tel: There is nothing is durable, so long as we heer dwel. And though a man be nere so wise yet folly eke and greef: To reign in him he may confesse, as part of his beleef. The ii. Chapiter. Begin he did to take delight, in pleasures and in game: His eye ne likte, but he it got, ful vain he found the same. As wel the wise to graue shall go, as shall the idiot fool: Wherfore to eat and cheerful be, he puth vs to that scoole. The iii. Chapiter. Confesse he dooth that all thing hath, a time to go and coome: That all things was the whiche is now, and shalbe in the roome. The woorks of God moste perfet are and cause vs him to fear: Bothe good and bad the Lord shall Iudge when that he shall appeer. The iiii. Chapiter. Doutles the cause of Innocents not heard did vexe him muche: Our labour heer is ful of greef, the vanitie is suche. Societie and feloweship, is better then alone: A yung man poor if he be wise, excels a foole in throne. The v. Chapiter. Elect and chuse thy woords aright, when thou to God doost speak: The labouring man dooth sleep ful sound, when Diues braines dooth break. Man when he dyeth shall nothing haue but that whiche he did bring: To eat and drink and ioyful be, it passeth heer all thing. The vi. Chapiter. Ful foolishe is the riche man sure, whom God muche good hath sent: And yet t'enioy the things he hath, the hart is not him lent. But he that hath not swet therfore, shall eat it vp at wil: Yet way they not their greedy lust, and all the mouth to fil. The vii. Chapiter. Good wholesome rules heer are you giuen from mourning for to flee: Flee hasty speeche and angry mood let wisedome guide thine eye. So shall shee make thee strong in deed, muche folly to preuent: Man was made good, now is he bad, by things hee did inuent. The viii. Chapiter. How that we must obay the King and rulers that doo reign: And yet how none is Lord of death. his life for to retain. This chapter telth and furthermore, how Gods woorks are vnknown: Though God prolong to punishe sin yet fear thou him alone. The ix. Chapiter. In looking vpon outward things, that God dooth giue to man: To iudge whom he dooth looue or hate, that iustly no man can. Nor tel the time when he shall die, therfore for wisedome seek: If thou be poore though thou be wise, yet none wil to thee seek. The x. Chapiter. Knowe wel ye may the difference twixt wisedome and a fool: The babling tung that slaunder dooth, yee shall not easely coole. He telth of Kings that folly haue, and wilbe ouerseen: That land is blest whose hed is wise, be it a King or Queen. The xi. Chapiter. Like, liberall men he dooth exhort, to poore that they should bee: And not to dout Gods prouidence, what so that we doo see. That prosperous state heer in this life, is vanitie and shall: As long as world dooth stand with men but God shall iudge vs all. The xii. Chapiter. Men that run on til youth be past, and neuer doo repent: In age shall short come of their wil, when vain their time is spent. This is the end fear God and keep, all his commaundementes: For God wil bring foorth euery woork, and giue them their Iudgements. FINIS. The Preacher thus his sermon ends, bothe short and sweet to hear: The plesant song of Salomon, shall now to you appeer. By parables how Christe dooth loue, his Churche he dooth you showe: And eke againe how shee him loues, heer may you read and knowe. The Canticles of Salomon. The i. Chapiter. A fr?dly talke the Churche dooth vse to Christe her loue so deer: And he again so sets her out, as none to bee her peer. Though foes doo fume to see their looue, and faultes in her there be: Yet by his fauour and his grace, they bothe doo wel agree. The ii. Chapiter. Beautifully as Lilly fair, her song forthe on shee sings And shade shee took to rest her self, euen vnderneath his wings. Shee heares his voice as dooue ful milde, and dooth thereto incline: The Fory foes they are forbod, from hurting of the vine. The iii. Chapiter. Cast care shee did her loue to finde, and sought in euery ground: Shee ceased not to seek and aske vntil shee had him found. How shee did passe from wildernes, with smoky pillers smelt: How Princelike eke King Salomon, within his Pallaice dwelt. The iiii. Chapiter. Doutles ful fair thou art my loue and blemishe hast thou none: Thy teeth, thy lips, thy neck and brestes are comely euery one. My sister deer hee dooth her call, and looue on her he showes: Commaunding windes to doo her good though contrary it blowes. The v. Chapiter. Eche thing that Christ hath of his own vnto his Churche he giues: For to perfourm his tresures great to her, it not him greeues. His voice shee heares and dooth confes her self to be but bare: How beautiful her husband is, shee dooth at large declare. The vi. Chapiter. Ful sure shee is of Christes looue, and he of hers ful sure: Whose comely state is painted out to be ful fair and pure. Shee is but one and vndefilde, by Christe who made her cleane: Where puritie of her is spoke, none other dooth it mean. The vii. Chapiter. Go on shee dooth in comely wise ful seemly to beholde: Of all her parts so beautiful, heer vnto you is tolde. From top to toe shee is describde, of Christe the onely spouse: Who like a palme dooth growe ful trim, with Christe vpon her bowes. The viii. Chapiter. Him dooth shee chuse her for to teache, by him shee is vpholde: The looue that hee to her dooth beat, with tung can not be tolde. Shee is again that plesant vine, that foorth her frute dooth bring: For Christe her looue forefigured, by Salomon the King. FINIS. This song ful hard to vnderstand, dooth end with Chapters eyght. VVith iudgement great it woold be red, it is of mickle weight. Though fooles doo laugh and toy there at, yet be you sure of this: The ioyfull'st song in Bible book, assuredly it is. Now shall ye hear what Esay saith, he tolde of Christe to fore: Ful Gospel like he telth his tale, now harken to his lore. Esay the Prophet The i. Chapiter. All creatures he dooth wil to bear, record what he shall say: How god had been vnto the Iewes ful merciful alway. But seeing God they did not fear, he threatneth them ful sore: That God would ease him on his greef yet sauing some in store. The ii. Chapiter. Before he telth by Prophesie, how that the Gentiles all: Should be conuerted to the Lord, and woorship him they shall. Laying aside all variance, and strife against the Lord: But Israel should plagued be, because he was vntoward. The iii. Chapiter. Cast out he would the heads and cheef, of all among the Iewes: And send them children for to rule, he telleth them this newes. And all because their pride was suche, their rulers went astray: Their women eke should baldnes haue, whose tussocks had been gay. The iiii. Chapiter. Destruction shall so light on them their men shall so decay: That wemen seuen shall take one man, to be to them a stay. But after this the Lord shall turn his heauy wrathful hand: And cause the remnant of the Iust, in peace to haue the land. The v. Chapiter. Esay dooth now begin to sing, a song for to describe: The Churche how like a vine it is, wel fenst on euery side. But no good grape yet did it bear, but braunches foorth it brought: So curseth hee their greedines, excesse and things they wrought. The vi. Chapiter. Ful power he hath to Prophesie God sitting in his throne: Dooth send him foorth to tel the flock, their sinnes him self alone. Their eares they stopt they would not hear their hartes they were so hard: They had no awe vnto his woords, they did him not regard. The vii. Chapiter. Go tel the King, God said to him the enemies shall not harm: That Iuda haue conspired to hurt, regard not thou the swarm. A signe was giuen a virgin should, conceiue and bear a childe: So long before of Christe he tolde, whose comming should be milde. The viii. Chapiter. How Israel and Iuda bothe, as captiues should be led: Th'Assirians power he telth before, who should of them be hed. And how that Christe moste holy then should be a stumbling stone: Exhort he dooth to godlines the faithful euery one. The ix. Chapiter. In darknes though the Gentiles sat, yet vnto light they shall: Be calld by Christe who is the God, that ruleth ouer all. To the ten tribes he telth before, that they should be cast out: Because they did contemn the Lord, and were so proud and stout. The x. Chapiter. Knowe wo and pain they shall that doo make lawes the poore to noy: Th'Assirian prince should plague his churche and God would him destroy. And yet to comfort his elect, a remnant he dooth say: For all the spoile should yet be sau'de, and kept vntil a day. The xi. Chapiter. Lineally how Christe should come, of Iesses stock he telth: And of his vertues and his power whiche far alone excelth. The mightie power shalbe ful milde at time when he shall reign: His freendes shall floorish his foes shal fear their brags shalbe but vain. The xii. Chapiter. Muche laud &amp; praise shal then be made and sing they shall with cheer: Though God was angry with his flock, yet mercies now appeer. And saying we saluation may, now hope to draw from him: His name we wil set out and praise let Sion sing this himn. The xiii. Chapiter. Now dooth he tel how God should call, the Medis in their might: The Persians eke for to appeer his battail for to fight. For to destroy the Babel power, and bring their pride ful lowe: And all their fame and progeny, out right to ouerthrowe. The xiiii. Chapiter. One cause he telth why Babilon, should so destroyed be: Because the Iewes there captiues were but so should be set free. And how he should derided be, and come vnto his end: The Philistins for all his death, no ioy should apprehend. The xv. Chapiter. Perfourm would God yet further more and Moab would he smite: Their cheefest townes should taken be, and spoild from them by might. Their riuer great should stayned be, with blood of their owne stock, Their ruine should on them so light, for hurting of his flock. The xvj. chapiter. Quit him now God dooth ful intend, of Moab for his pride: Because his Churche they would not help when hurtes did them betide. Their pride therfore shall haue a fall, he telleth to them plain: In three yeeres space the multitude should taken be or slain. The xvii. chapiter. Rewarded should Damascus be the Sirians he dooth mean: And Ephraim that did decline, should neee be wasted clean. By scourges great they should repent, their straying so from God: A forren power shall them inuade, but sudenly forbod. The xviii. Chapiter. Suche ships as sayled on the sea, by Ethiopia might: He wilth to flee with wings of sailes, to tel the world the plight. That Israel was brought vnto, for breaking of their law: How Gentiles should be calld to grace, and stand of God in awe. The xix. Chapiter. The burden of the heauy plague, that Egipt should sustain: By Assirian power because they put, their trust in Idols vain. Yet shall the Lord giue them his law and Assur eke the same: And Israel in midst of them, these three shall praise his name. The xx. Chapiter. When woords would not make them beleeue what Esay then said: A signe he gaue by nakednes, that so they should be paid. For three yeeres space th'Assirians should the Ethiopians broile: And Egipt land likewise subdue. not sparing bothe to spoile. The xxj. chapiter. Again he telth how Babilon, should quite be ouerthrowne: Babel is falne, Babel is falne, so should the noyes be blowne. Idumea and Arabie, the like should them befall: The Medes and eke Persians, should bring them in to thrall. The xxii. chapiter. Because Hierusalem did trust, in walles and diches deep: Therfore the Prophet telth their fall, whiche causeth him to weep. And how that Sobna had him made, a Sepulture in vain: For why as captiue he should die, with tossed life in pain. The xxiii. Chapiter. Cast down he saith that God would doo, the pride of Tirus town: The marchants that had world at wil, should be of small renown. And yet when yeeres are past and gone, that for her plague are sent: Shee should again to former state, be set and so repent. The xxiiii. chapiter. Declare he dooth that God wil curse, and strike the earth for sin: Bothe hed and foot none should escape, when that he dooth begin. And yet not so but that a few, should wel escape the same: Unto the end that they might shew the prayses of his name. The xxv. Chapiter. Exalt he dooth the Lord aboue, and praise him euermore: For punishing the wicked so, whiche set not by his lore. And for the sparing of his flock, and forcing foes to vade: By similitude vnto his saints, a feast to them he made. The xxvi. Chapiter. Faithful men heer sing to their God, and doo therin confesse: Their sauing helth to come from him, and eke also their peace. And how the dead in perfet shape, shall rise out of the dust: And how the Lord shall visit them, that in him had no trust. The xxvii. Chapiter. God wil destroy Leuiathan, the Deuil and all his might: And wil defend his vine the Churche, and purge her in his sight. Then shall shee render to the Lord, his laudes with willing wil: When from their foes they be returnd, vnto his holyhil. The xxviii. Chapiter. How God would plague the Israelites, who wine so fast did drink: That drunkennes they wayed more, then on his law to think. The stumbling stone that he would lay, and woork his wil when hee: Should see his time and point his place, how euery thing should be. The xxix. Chapiter. Ierusalem shall punisht be, their sacrifice shall ceace: Their aulter shall oreturned be, their foes on them shall preace. With lips alone and dreames of men, because they did him serue: He would them strike and yet of looue, some seed he would preserue. The xxx. chapiter. Knowing that they at Egipt sought, for help in their distresse: And that they did the Prophets mock, whiche sought them to redresse, Therfore he telth destruction, to light vpon the swarme: But yet all suche as doo repent, he saith shall take no harme. The xxxi. Chapiter. Likewise the Lord dooth curse all th?, that doo his help forsake: And put their trust in man or horse, fore him that did them make. And yet stil fauour he dooth, faith, to them that wil amend: And cast their Idols quite away, on whom they did depend. The xxxii. Chapiter. Muche good dooth come when rulers good haue place to sit &amp; Iudge: The nature of a churle is suche, against the poore to grudge. That careles wemen shall lament, the ruine shalbe suche: But when that Christ shal come to reign their comfort shalbe muche. The xxxiii. Chapiter. No gain at all shall they obtain, that doo the Churche molest: When they haue spoild &amp; doon their wil, God wil their deeds detest. And giue vnto his flock a pause, while he dooth strike their foes: That better they may keep his lawes, that all their dooings knowes. The xxxiiii. chapiter. Of very looue that God dooth bear, to his elected sorte: He wil imbrue his swoord in blood, to bate the wicked porte. And so destroy the cursed train, their Cittie so deface: That Oule &amp; Rauen with Ziim and Lim, shall there haue dwelling place. The xxxv. chapiter. Perfet good ioy, beleef in Christe, to suche that heer doo dwel: Dooth bring to them their office tolde that preache to men Gospel. And eke the frute of those that hear, the preching of it right: To Sion shall they turn again, and that in ioyful plight. The xxxvi. Chapiter. Questionles the pride was great, of Rabsaketh the Prince: He thought by threats to make y? Iewes, not able for to quinche. Blaspheming God with spiteful taunts and bragging in the might: Of his great King Senacherib, he spake his speeche in spight. The xxxvii. Chapiter. Renting his clothes, Ezechiah axt councel of Esay: Who tolde him plain he need not fear, the Lord his foes would pay. Senacherib blasphemde again, then Ezechiah praid: An Angel did his foes destroy, so fel it as was sayd. The xxxviiii. Chapiter. So sick then fel Ezechiah, God did him helth restore: And caused him prolong his yeeres, for fifteen had he more. Then gaue he thanks vnto the Lord, when signe of helth he saw: And leaues of Figs vnto his pain, were layd his sore to drawe. The xxxix. chapiter. Then was the King reprooued muche, Ezechiah by name: For shewing of his treasures great, to men that were of fame. And that was to Embassadours, that came from Babilon: Therfore the Prophet Esay saith thou shalt be wo begon. The xl. Chapiter. Whiche way our sinnes remitted be, by Christe he telth before: And of Iohn Baptist he dooth shew, and what shalbe his lore. Rebuking eke Idolaters, describing them ful plain: And eke all those whiche God forsook, and man dooth trust ful vain. The xli. Chapiter. Alone dooth God his people chuse and that of mercy meer: They beeing those among them selues eche one dooth other cheer. With comfort he dooth comfort them their Idolles are but vain: No things to come can tel but God ne make that douts be plain. The xlii. Chapiter. Beholde he wilth that ready prest is Christe for to obay: In humblenes by suffering wise, for our offence to pay. The deafe, the blinde, and prisoners, with suche like to releeue: The Gentiles all shall called be, vnto the right beleeue. The xliii. Chapiter. Cast care aside and haue good hope, let nought make you afraid: Thou Iacobs house, for I thy God, wil surely be thyne ayd: Alone I wil thy foes confound, and eke also remit: Thy sin my self of my good wil, and think no more of it. The xliiii. Chapiter. Doo dout away, be of good cheer, yet once again my flock: I am the same that alwayes hath, born looue vnto your stock. The Image and the woorkmaster, are vain and perishe shall: Though they be false he wil perfourm, his seruants sayings all. The xlv. Chapiter. Erect a King he would, that should, set free his Churche at large: Cirus by name was he that should receiue of God the charge. There is none iust but God alone that ruleth ouer all: Who wil so woork that euery knee, shall down before him fall. The xlvi. Chapiter. Falne flat to ground is Babilon, their Idols eke of golde: Are beaten down whiche in the streetes, their shoulders vp did holde. The Iewes he calth that they should mark his woorkes of w?ders wrought: His Iustice and his mercy bothe, should soon to them be brought. The xlvii. Chapiter. God now dooth tel why Babel great, should once be set a side: Because that shee no mercy shewd, when Iuda shee did guide. And for their pride and bragging boste, and eke her foolishe trust: That in enchaunting shee did put, now feel her fall shee must. The xlviii. Chapiter. He telth of their Hipocrisie, and dooth the same reprooue: Deferring yet them to reward, so mooued by his looue. Exhorting them to worship him, for that to him is due: So would he out of Babilon, deliuer all their crue. The xlix. Chapiter. I doo exhort yee nations all, that yee beleeue and holde: The promises whiche God hath plight and often to you tolde. For sauing helth vnto you all, if you the same beleeue: By Christe and eke deliuerance, from foes yee shall atcheeue. The l. Chapiter. Knowne vnto God was wel the cause why he the Iewes forsook: The cause was their Iniquitie, the whiche in hand they took. Yet should they knowe the power of God not minisht long to be: Christe shall obay and vpper hand, of foes attain shall he. The li. Chapiter. Look wel vpon the faith that once, in Abraham was found: For I am hee, thus saith the Lord, that shall thy foes confound. Though scourged be Hierusalem, yet shall their woful crosse: Be profitable vnto them, therby to haue no losse. The lii. Chapiter. Make mery yee my people all, captiuitie is past: And ioyful freedome ye shall haue, giuen vnto you at last. His messengers he wil send out, their beautie shall excel: But one of all aboue the rest, shall bear away the bel. The liii. Chapiter. Not one almoste that should beleeue, in Christe because that hee: So simple should appeer to men, and in suche pouertie. And yet him self should bear away, our sinnes vpon the crosse: And eke the pain vnto them due, so paying all our losse. The liiii. Chapiter. Of Gentiles mo the Gospel shall, imbrace, then of the Iewes: And frute shall bring accordingly, as hearers of suche newes. So God his people wil forsake, and stand aside a while: But yet at length he wil return, and freendly on them smile. The lv. Chapiter. Proclaim he dooth, who so is dry, come drink withouten cost: And pay no more to stay your thirst, your labour is but lost. Draw neer to God while he is nie, and doo away your sin: His woord shall not out from him passe, but somewhat it shall win. The lvi. chapiter. Qu?che not the right, let Iustice passe to Iudges he dooth speak: And saith for all, his house shalbe, therin their plaintes to break. The watche men blinde as Dogs are dum they wake but for their gain: From day to day to fil in wine, there in is all their pain. The lvii. Chapiter. Righteouse men God taketh hence, lest they of plagues should taste: Whiche he preparde to punishe sin vpon the earth to cast. Idolatrers they be rebukte, for seruing Idols vain: No peace can be to wicked men, but war and endles pain. The lviii. Chapiter. Spare not but cry should ministers, as watche men should they blowe: And tel the people their offence, not sparing hie or lowe. How Hipocrites look all for meed, in fasting of their fast: Of violence and dooing wrong, suche food we should not taste. The lix. Chapiter. The wicked by his wickednes, doothe perishe and decay: But godly men their sin confes, and so are doon away. For God him self his Churche wil saue, when strength of man dooth faile: His woord adioyned to his spirite, shall ouer all preuaile. The Lx. Chapiter. Unto the knowledge of the truthe, the Gentiles shall be brought: And heapes of them should come to god, as one that hath them bought. And Sion that forsaken was, and often had il luck: Should be refresht w? paps of Queenes, for on them should shee suck. The Lxi. Chapiter. Anointed Christe is sent to preache the wretched to releeue: And sauing helth to giue to them, whiche on him doo beleeue. For whiche the faithful doo reioyce, and lauds vnto him bring: He shall cause vertue in his Churche, abundantly to spring. The Lxii. Chapiter. Behold the day right fain they would wherin that they might see: The Christe that should by promise tolde set them at large and free. Good pastours ceasse not for to preache, and teache the way aright: How people shall escape the rod, that els on them should light. The lxiii. Chapiter. Come foorth and doo his feat alone shall God, his Churche to saue: And in his wrath tread down the foes, that gainst his flock did raue. Great benefits of his meer looue, to his stil shew he dooth: Though Abram doo not knowe our state yet God it kens forsooth. The lxiiii. Chapiter. Direct he dooth to God his speeche, his prayers dooth begin: Intreating not that he would think, vpon the peoples sin. But rather that of him they might, some succour feel and taste: In waying how their church was burnt, and Cittie lay ful wast. The lxv. Chapiter. Eftsoones he telth how Gentiles shall him seek and eke imbrace: And how that Iewes for scorning him should be set in their place Muche ioy the chosen should atcheeue, where as contrary wise: Great punishement shall on them light, that doo his name despise. The Lxvi. Chapiter. Ful hie abooue God hath his seat, and eke in hart of man: And not in temple made by men, and sacrifices than. He dooth mislike when mercy wantes: oppressed he releeues: The wicked with eternall pain, by Iustice stil he greeues. FINIS. Thus haue you heard this Prophet speak, of Christe his kingdome muche: Rebuking sin with threats ful sore, against bothe poor and riche. And how the Iewes should feel the stroke of Gods ful mightie hand: By spoiles and waste that forren foes should make within their land. And yet not quite forsaken should, they be, when they did yeeld: But be restorde and turne againe, their Cittie for to build. And that their foes whiche once did flowe, and floorishe in their fume: At length should stoup and to them bow, and should no more presume. To doo them harme, and some of them should quite their Kingdomes leese: And heaps of Gentiles God should serue, ful humbly on their knees. For magistrates that Iudge not iust, and Prelates in their pride: And people stout with necks ful stiffe, he telth what shall betide. Now Ieremy shall shew him self, what God by him did speak: VVho very yong was sent of God, his minde to Iewes to break. And fortie yeeres he prophesied, fiue Kings were come and gone, At home he taught and eke abroad to them at Babilon. The Prophecy of Ieremy. The i. Chapiter. At what time he did prophecy, and also how that he: Did think him self not to be meet, to be as he should be. But God dooth him incourage foorth and bids him to be bolde: So then of their captiuitie, by Ieremy is tolde. The ii. Chapiter. Before their eyes he dooth set out what God for them had wrought: How they again and eke their preests, did set the Lord at nought. Therfore their sinne shall them destroy, so that they shall not say: That God is cause or hath delight, that they should so decay. The iii. Chapiter. Cry out he dooth and calth on them, their sinnes for to repent: So should their Churche be heald again, God would from wrath relent. Of Iudah and of Israel, comparison he dooth make: Whiche for their whoring Idoll wise, deuorcement he would make. The iiii. Chapiter. Doutles if truly they repent, God would them not subuert: The Circumcision outwardly, not like to that in hart. How Iudah should destroyed be, for their vngodlinesse: For whiche the Prophet dooth lament, in seeing their distresse. The v. Chapiter. Euery sort were falne away, from subiect vnto hed: Bothe swearing false, and whorishe life as neyghing horse they led. Therfore should Iudah be destroyed, the Caldeys should them wast: So should they for their sinful life, suche sorowes feel and taste. The vi. Chapiter. From far their foes should c?e &amp; flock, their Cittie to beset: Their sin was cause they cared not when preachers did them threat. The Caldeys should this reuel make, not sparing yung nor olde: He willeth them to mourn, but they regard not what is tolde. The vii. Chapiter. God dooth rebuke the confidence, in temple that they had: For there they thought to make amends though life were nere so bad. Muche euil should surely light on them, for Prophets they despise: Obedience God better likes, then any sacrifice. The viii. Chapiter. He telth what reuel forren power should make among the Iewes: And how if that they did repent, they should haue better newes. The Prophets false hee dooth rebuke, for vttering of lies: Lamenting muche their sorrowe sharp that should against them rise. The ix. Chapiter. In seeing what disceit did reign, he wisheth that he dwelt: Him self alone in wildernes, where no suche thing is felt. In knowing God we onely ought therein our ioy to finde: The circumcision of the fleshe, not like that is in minde. The x. Chapiter. Knowe wel they might that Gods of golde of wood and siluer eke: Be far from Gods when they can not once go ne stand, or speak. Their pastours were but beastes eche one their flocks did wander wide: In man there is no good at all, for succour yet shee cride. The xi. Chapiter. Look wel they ought to keep the law, for els hee dooth them curse: When they were wild for to amend, they were so muche the woorse. Their fathers steps in worship false, they walke to their decay: To Idols help he wilth to seek, for them he might not pray. The xii. Chapiter. Muche muse he dooth at wickeds welth yet God remayneth iust: The Iewes forsaken of the Lord, in him they did not trust. The shepheards did the sheep seduce, and trod his vine to ground: And if conuert from sinnes they would, then fauour should be found. The xiii. Chapiter. Not woords alone but signes therto, God addid them to warne: But nought would help their life so bad they Iustly took their harme. Why God to fauour did them take, and why he them refusde: If they would mend the wicked life, they should not be misusde. The xiiii. Chapiter. Of dearth that on the land should fal and how the people praid: And suche as faith did want to them, their prayers are denaid. The prophets that by false reporte, did say from God they came: Should feel the thing that they denied, suche peace by lies they wan. The xv. Chapiter. Past help they were tho Moyses should and Samuel for them pray: Yet pestilence with swoord and dearth, and captiue led away. Shuld light on them yet some shuld rest, to God them dooth he call: In mid among the rout, God made him as a brasen wall. The xvi. Chapiter. Quaint not thy self with wom? kinde, a wife to thee to take: For plague I wil this people sore, and captiues them wil make. In Babilon: and yet return they shall vnto this land: The Gentiles shall their Gods forsake, and take the truthe in hand. The xvii. Chapiter. Right froward were the Iewes and curst for putting trust in man: Whose hart ful wicked is and il, God onely searche it can. The liuing waters they forsook, the Saboth day they brake: Whiche if in time they mended not, their fier should not slake. The xviii. Chapiter. Suche power as in the potter is, to break his pottes at wil: Suche power hath God (who can deny?) his foes with force to kil. The Iewes conspierd that Ieremy should vexed be with speed: And he to God his prayers made, to plague them and their seed. The xix. Chapiter. Tel thou the heads, said God to him, that they shall perishe all: For sheding blood, and offring vp their seruice vnto Ball. Afore them all thy bottle break of earth out of thy hand: Euen so likewise tel them, I wil destroy them and their land. The xx. Chapiter. Wh? Pashur heard that Ieremy preacht he stroke him and thereto: To iayle he went it helped not, he taught as wunt to doo. It greeu'd him muche y? they him mockt he thought to holde his peace: The woord so boyled in his brest, to speak he could not cease. The xxi. Chapiter. Again when he was wild to tel, what should of them become: He said by swoord and pestilence, all should be slain saue some. And those should be suche of the Iewes as would them selues submit: And be content in Caldey land, as captiues for to sit. The xxii. Chapiter. Bidden he was to tel the King, that Iustice he should vse: If not, that God would vtterly, bothe him and his refuse. Suche as with wrong their houses build he cryeth on them wo: Because in welth they would not heare their pride should come ful lowe. The xxiii. Chapiter. Curse he dooth heer fr? God his mouth, suche pastours as doo feed Them selues: and let the flock alone, God wil them pay in deed. And pastours pure he wil prouide, wherof one shall be cheef: From Dauids house as King to guide, by him to haue releef. The xxiiii. Chapiter. Declare God dooth by baskets twaine, with Figs bothe good and bad: What should become vpon the flock, as he decreed had. Whiche was that some should haue return and liue in rest and peace: The King should not with many mo, whose hartes he could not pearce. The xxv. Chapiter. Exiled men in Babilon, the Iewes for sin should bee: Ful seuentie yeeres the Prophet saith, in their captiuitie. At which yeeres end that mightie power shalbe subuerted quite. And in like wise he telth before, all rule shall lose their might. The xxvi. Chapiter. Ful earnestly he dooth them mooue, their sinnes for to repent: They brought him foorth, he telth his tale the Iudges did relent. But Vriah who fled for fear, was fetcht from Egipt land: Iehoyaku of Iudah King, him slue with swoord in hand. The xxvii. Chapiter. God willed him that he should send bothe yokes and bonds also, To Princes, for to testify in bondage they should go. And who so would refuse to serue, Nabuchodonozer, Should plagued be, therfore he wilth false Prophets not to hear. The xxviii. Chapiter. Hananiah the Prophet false did prophecy a lie: And Ieremy did him reprooue afore great company. Also a freshe he prophecied, because his yoke was burst: That bondage muche should come to them and that therto then trust. The xxix. Chapiter. In written woords he sent to them, that then in Babel were, That they should plant, &amp; wed, and pray for suche as ruled there. For seuentie yeeres should passe and go, ere they should turn again: And in that space their land and power, should wasted be and slain. The xxx. Chapiter. Knowledge again fr? Ieremies mouth, was giuen to Israel: That they should home again return, within their land to dwel And how that God would him reuenge vpon their furious foes: But comfort his afflicted Churche, and saue her from her woes. The xxxi. Chapiter. Large blessing heer he telth to come. when home they should return: All ioy shall come and plesantnes, to suche as once did mourn. A couenant new within their hartes, also he plight to make: That he would be their God in deed, if they not him forsake. The xxxii. Chapiter. Many were the miseries that, Ieremy did sustain: For now he is in prison cast, for speaking out so plain. A feeld he bought and hid the book, that did record the same: His prayers he made and once again, their turning home did name. The xxxiii. Chapiter. Now is the Prophet wild to pray, for their return and rest: Whiche ful and whole is graunted them as they had had it erst. With pardon for their former sinnes, without their owne desartes. And Christe to reign in Dauids throne, for euer in their hartes. The xxxiiii. Chapiter. Of Zedechiah who was King, of Iuda: what should come: How he should taken be and his, when Cittie and all is wun. Because the couenant they did break, to bond folke that they made: Their lot with pine or pestilence, should be or els with blade. The xxxv. Chapiter. Put foorth he dooth as God him bade, the Rechabites for lore: Who would not break the olde preceptes from fathers had tofore. But Iewishe pride would not obey, though often they were warnd: Therfore to ruine they should go, the Rechabites not harmd. The xxxvi. Chapiter. Quenched lest y? his woords should be, God bad to write them all: So Baruch did and red the role, before bothe great and small. The King a little heard of it, and burnt the book in fire: Again with more it written was, and God prouokte to ire. The xxxvii. Chapiter. Right soon as Zedechiah reignd, to Ieremy he sent, To pray for him. By Egipt power the Caldeys away went. As Ieremy was prest away, in dungeon was he cast: But when the King had talkt with him, he begd a better taste. The xxxviii. Chapiter. So fairly spake the councellours, the Princes eares vntil, That Ieremy to dungeon went, there thought they him to kil. An Enuche black his life did saue, and drue him vp with cordes: The King and he did talke alone, he might not tel the Lords. The xxxix. Chapiter. The Babel power the Cittie took, and Zedechiah fled: He was ouer caught, his sonnes were slain his eyes put out of his hed. The poore alone are left in land, and Ieremy at large: Who gaue them more that did him good, a comfortable charge. The xl. Chapiter. Unto two things the Prophet had a choise at wil to chuse. Babel to see, or tary stil the first he did refuse. Suche as for fear were fled away to Godoliah came: Whom Babel King had left to rule, all Iudah that he wan. The xli. Chapiter. A murder foule committed was of Ismael by name: For Godoliah he did kil, who did deserue no blame. And diuers more that wicked man, their liues did also end: And fled to King of Moabites, who therfore did him send. The xlii. Chapiter. Bothe moste and least to Ieremy came his councel to haue: And willed him to knowe of God, whiche way them selues to saue, Who willed them in any wise, to Egipt not to wend: For if they did that whiche they feard, their God would it them send. The xliii. Chapiter. Contrary to their former graunt, to Egipt needs they would: The Prophet checkt, and Baruch eke, who needs with them they should. And there did God by Ieremy, tel Egipt of her fall: How Nebuchadnezer in place should rule their Gods and all. The xliiii. Chapiter. Declare he dooth vnto the Iewes, for their Idolatrie, In Egipt land the whiche they did, that they should surely die. But men and wiues with froward harts did tel what they did deem: We neuer throue sins that we left, to serue the heauenly Queen. The xlv. Chapiter. Euilly appaid was Baruch then, he thought his life but lost: His sorrowes did increase in him seeing the Iewes so tost. But Ieremy him comfort gaue, and set his hart at stay: For God (he said) hath giuen to thee, thy life to be a pray. The xlvi. Chapiter. From God he speaks to Egipt land, and telleth them ful plain: How that the King of Babilon, withall his mightie train. Should them destroy and eke their King their God and mightie power: But yet his chosen Iacobs seed, he would not quite deuour. The xlvii. Chapiter. God bad him tel the Philistins, of their decay and end: That parents to suche wo should come, their Children not to tend. How they of Tire and Zidon eke, should wasted be also: The wrath of God not ceasing til, their pride were come ful lowe. The xlviii. Chapiter. He telleth to the Moabites, their ruine and decay: Who once like churles to Israel, vngraciously did say. He curseth them that should them spare, or stay his hand from blood: And that because their pride was suche, and hautie stubborn mood. The xlix. Chapiter. In like (he saith) the Ammonites, whose valleyes were so fair And Esaus stock the Edomites, that thought of no dispair. Damascus and Kedar also, whom nothing did anoy: With Elam eke, all these he said, the Caldes should destroy. The l. Chapiter. Knoweledge tofore of Babels fall, he gaue also to them: How that the Persians and the Medes, should quite destroy their steme. And how that God vpon his flock, would haue a new regard: And them restore into their state, and giue their foes reward. The li. Chapiter. Largely he writes and telth the cause, of Babels fall and spoile: In Israels blood they did reioyce, when that they had the foile. The power of God he dooth describe, and Idols vain denies: He saith the Caldeys should so fall, as neuer more to rise. The lii. Chapiter. Mark wel what rebels come vnto, let Zedechiah preache: He first rebeld and after fled, his foes did him areche. The temple burnt, the Cittie stroyd, and thousands captiue led: But Iehoyakim fauour found, the King lift vp his hed. FINIS. Thus Ieremy that liued so long, and Kings so many saw: That bode suche broyles for saying sooth, to those that had no awe. His tale is tolde, his book is doon, now shall you hear vs tel, How wofully he did lament, the fall of Israel. The Lamentation of Ieremy The i. Chapiter. All help is past, Hierusalem, is now subuerted quite: Her freends are now become her foes when fayled is her might. Her streetes are void her preestes are slain, her foes they doo reioice: Nothing but teares and heuines, hath sin set for her choice. The ii. chapiter. Beholde the holdes are now destroyd, the Princes ouerthrowne: The Saboths and the holy place, they cannot now be knowne. The Uirgins and the Seniours, sit weeping on the ground: The enemies doo clap their hands, no comfort can be found. The iii. Chapiter. Complain he dooth of all the greefs, that many wayes he felt: And yet in God he puts his trust, that alwayes his hath helpt. For sin, the Lord dooth his correct, whiche best is to confesse: And then he wil his fauour send, and things amisse redresse. The iiii. Chapiter. Doutles the wise like to fine Golde, are now like potters clay: The Nazarites that were so fair, their beautie is away. With hunger wemen sore opprest, their Children they doo eat: The bloody preestes and Prophets false did bring to them this meat. The v. Chapiter. End heer his Lamentations, hee dooth with earnest prayer: Beseeching God to look vpon, how foes with them did fare. Confessing yet that he dooth reign and shall for euermore: Who turning vs then shall we turn, and surely not before. FINIS. Ezechiel dooth now begin, to fortifie and prooue: That God would sure the Iewishe Churche, as he had said, remooue. By visions straunge he dooth expresse, the things to come to passe: As he in Caldey land did dwel, where he a captiue was. Yet comfort dooth he giue again, to the afflicted flock: And telth the ruine of their foes, and suche as did them mock. But cheef of all the regiment, of Christes kingdome pure, He dooth see out an happy state, for euer to indure. The Prophecy of Ezechiel The i. Chapiter. As he in Caldey land did dwel, by Chobar riuer side: In the fift yeer that Iehoyakim, the King did there abide. Ezechiel a vision, of foules and wheeles did see: And one vpon a bowe did sit, on hie in maiestie. The ii. chapiter. Bidden he was for to stand vp, and speak against the Iewes, Their sinnes rebuke, &amp; how they should his preaching quite refuse. Rebelling stil, as auncetours of them had doon before: A hand he saw that helde a book, that sorrowes threat therfore. The iii. chapiter. Caused he was to eat the book, and boldenes God him gaue With strength &amp; power, w? woord &amp; sprite him self for to behaue. His charge is giuen, his office set, whiche if he should neglect, The folke in sin should perishe all, and he for blood be checkt. The iiii. Chapiter. Declare he dooth Hierusalem besieged for to bee: And many yeeres the Israelites, to feel captiuitie. And hunger suche on them to fall, as like hath not been heard: Their excrementes of force to eat, good food should be so bard. The v. chapiter. Eftsoones a signe to him was giuen, by shauing of his hear: By burning some, by wherling some, and little some to spare. That so stroke with the Pestilence, with swoord and famine great: Should be disperst and eke so plagued, as Childe the Fathers meat. The vi. chapiter. For woorshipping of Images, and Idols that are vain: On tops on hils, and eke in vales, he saith they shalbe slain. A remnant yet there shalbe left, that in their woful greef: Shall them repent and turn to God, and haue of him releef. The vii. Chapiter. God dooth by him tel plainly out, the ruine of the land: From Est to west, from north to south, no part of it to stand. But all should be subuerted quite, he wil not chaunge his minde: In preest or els in auncient man, no councel should they finde. The viii. Chapiter. He sitting in his house among, the auncients in exile, Hierusalem he went vnto, in vision for a while. And there suche euils in secret place, he saw them to commit And eke abrode whiche caused iust, them to be plagde for it. The ix. Chapiter. Ierusalem that did commit, suche euils as were to bad, Hath now suche measure meett to them, as once they mesured had. But one yclad in linnen white, did mark the mourning sort: And they did scape when ruine fel, the marker made report. The x. chapiter. Knowe moore he dooth of things tofore, The man arayd in white: Did fier fetche from Cherubins, appearing to his sight. And then the beastes and eke the wheeles, that he had seen tofore: He saw again in vision wise, with sundry faces foure. The xi. Chapiter. Led now he was for to beholde the cheef that ruled il: And wild to say that they should pay, for blood that they did spil. A ruler died, then out he cride to God to holde his hand: His bown is heard, and Cherubs gone, and he in Caldey land. The xii. Chapiter. More plainly by a fardle born, and packing in the day: Their thraldome and captiuitie, thereby perceiue they may. A remnant yet should saued be, to tel of all their gilt: And speedely the wrath should come, though otherwaies they built. The xiii. Chapiter. Now dooth he tel the Prophets false, what should of them betide: Their daubed wall that they had made, it should not long abide. Their women eke that pillowes made, and kercheues for to charme, Should perishe to, for promising the wicked safe from harm. The xiiii. Chapiter. Of suche as Idols in their hartes did keep, and yet pretends The contrary, and Prophets false, he telth of bothe their ends. Yet stil a remnant God wil keep, his Churche for to increace: The righteous men alone shall scape, their sin he wil releace. The xv. Chapiter. Profitable is not the wood, that commeth of the vine: No longer then it beareth frute, wherof is made the wine: Euen so likewise Hierusalem, that bringeth foorth no frute, Shalbe consumde with fier at home and eke in her pursute. The xvi. Chapiter. Quenche now their pride, he go'th about their progeny to tel: How bare they were, how God th? clad, they did that was not wel. For Sodome nor Samaria, suche whordome woorked not: In woorship false to Idoles vain, as neuer more was wrought. The xvij. chapiter. Reherse he dooth by Egles twain, what shall of Israel hap: Who thought to plant in Egipt power, but it should take no sap. Their King also that promise made, to Babel to obay: For breaking of his othe to him, ful deerly he should pay. The xviii. Chapiter. Sinne (wher it falth) shal haue reward, in him that dooth it vse: Eche man shall bear his owne offence, he shall none other chuse. But who so dooth his sin repent, shall pardon haue therfore: And he that dooth good life forsake, shall pay ful deer therfore. The xix. Chapiter. Tel now he dooth what Lions sprang out of the Lionesse: What catching Kings, Hierusalem did breed to her distresse. How as a vine shee floorisht once, and did from thence decay: And therfore now in wildernes, there should shee dry away. The xx. Chapiter. Unto him came the elders then, who did to them declare, For all their sin from time to time, how God yet did them spare, Not hearing suche as yeelded not, but wrath vpon them take, And spare the rest that feared him, euen for his mercies sake. The xxi, Chapiter. As woord hee saith shall all deuoure and spare ne hie nor lowe: The Babel power should all destroy, inchauntment taught him so. The Ammonites should also quaile, their kingdome should be wun: The Babel power should them destroy, where they their life begun. The xxii. Chapiter. Beholde this chapter, mark it wel, how all was out of frame: What sinnes there reignd in Israel, he dooth vnto you name. The rulers and the Prophets eke, the preestes and people all, In sundry sinnes withouten shame eche one of them did fall. The xxiii. Chapiter. Comparison of women twain, that whoredome doo commit, He dooth compare to Israel, and Iuda like to it. Whose filthy soule Idolatrie, prouoked God to ire: The Childe first born they spared not, to burn in flaming fire. The xxiiii. Chapiter. Declare he dooth by double signes, what they shall come vntil: As fleshe in pot dooth seethe to scum, so should they for their il. His wife dooth die, he mourned not, as he of God was wild: No more should they haue space thereto, when that their freends were kild. The xxv. Chapiter. Euil hap should come of Ammonites, and Moabites by name: Because they did reioyce and laugh, when Israel had blame. The Edomites and Philistines, should eke stoup to the Est, That is to say to Babel power, and be of them possest. The xxvi. Chapiter. For like offence that Cittie great, that Tirus hight by name: Should haue the foile and be possest of straungers to their shame. The Iles and merchantes wunder shall, when they shall hear the same: A Cittie new in ruine great, that was of mickle fame. The xxvij. chapiter. Great was the welth that Tirus had, he dooth tel it at length: Their fame, their name, their quiet state their power and eke their strength. All these with all their men and might, their force by sea and land: Should be destroyd for euermore, by might of forren band. The xxviii. Chapiter. He telleth now what pride he had, that Tirus rul'd as King: And of his fall and Cittie eke, they fearing no suche thing. To Zidon to he shewes asmuche, that like on them should fall: And how Gods folke should liue in peace when foes were stroyed all. The xxix. Chapiter. In like he saith that Egipt power, should quite be ouer run: And fortie yeeres it should lie waste, after that it were wun. The King of Babel should it haue, to be his souldiours gaines: Because at Tirus they did win small profit for their paines. The xxx. Chapiter. Knowe wel you may he dooth not fain but telth again their wo: Their c?trie spoild, their Citties down, their neighbours serued so. Their Idols eke should be defaste, their strength should not auaile? Their foes with force of God his power so fiercely should assail. The xxxi. Chapiter. Like power to the Assirians, in Egipt could not be: And yet Nabuchodonozer, the same destroyed he. This he dooth tel that they should think, that they might not withstand The rage of Babel when it com'th, for to destroy the land. The xxxii. Chapiter. Muche move to make now is he wild, for Pharo that was King, Who should be slain, and riuer ful of blood should ouer spring. As other Kings were ouerrun, and brought vnto the pit, So Egipt pride should haue a fall, as iust reward for it. The xxxiii. Chapiter. Note wel this thing when preachers preache &amp; warning men doo giue, They be dischargd if they repent: they shal be sure to liue. Eche man shall bear his owne offence, the godly shall haue meed: They that did rest and at him iest, ful wickedly should speed. The xxxiiii. Chapiter. Of shepheards that their profit seek, and not the sheep to feed, He dooth describe what God will doo, euen pay them for their meed, And take his flock in hand him self, deuiding sheep from sheep, And giue the flock at length to Christe, whiche truly shall them keep. The xxxv. Chapiter. Publishe vnto Idumea, he dooth what God would doo: Because that Israel they had greeu'd, they should be greeued to. As blooddely the Israelites, they had with war opprest: So should their blood be spilt again, and none of them haue rest. The xxxvi. Chapiter. Quicken he dooth the Israelites, that they should not dispair: For God would all their foes destroy, and them again repair. His mercy onely moouing him, and not of their desartes, And take from them their stony mindes, and giue them fleshy hartes. The xxxvii. Chapiter. Right soon as he in feeld was set, a miracle he wrought: For dried bones took fleshe and breath, that God vnto them brought. By whiche he telth that Israel, that seemed to be gone, Should safe return and Iuda bothe, and be eke ioynd in one. The xxxviii. Chapiter. Suche enemies as should arise he dooth them heer describe: As Gog and Magog in their power, the Churche for to deride. And they to come in latter dayes, as Prophets tolde tofore: Yet God should stay their furious rage, and punishe them therfore. The xxxix. Chapiter. The Lord is bent against this Gog, a wretched end to haue: Their slaughter such seu? monthes to seek to bring them vnto graue. Then shall his people rest in peace, and heathen tolde the cause: Why Israel afflicted was, for breaking of his lawes. The xl. Chapiter. Unto the Cittie he is rapt, and there he dooth beholde The building of it fair again, as it was to him tolde. From gate to gate all mesurde out an angel with a reed An eke a line, did point the same, as it should be in deed. The xli. Chapiter. At large to him described was, the temple then of God: And mesurde out by Cubits meet, euen with a reedy rod. The holy place, the Cherubins, and eke the Palmy trees: The courts, the doores, with all at large, in vision he sees. The xlii. Chapiter. Brought now he is to th'vtter court, the chambers for to see: In length and bredth, and tolde he is that there the preestes should be Apointed for to tire them selues, their portion eke to eat: And holy rowmes therin, to lay, the sacrificing meat. The xliii. Chapiter. Come now he is for to beholde, the glory of the Lord: Who wilth him tel the Israelites, that they shal be restorde, If they repent their former life, and doo no more there after: Then dooth he see set out to him, the fashion of the aulter. The xliiii. Chapiter. Declare he dooth good wholesom rules his preestes for to obserue: Look whiche of them had Idols likte, as preestes they might not serue. What robes to were, what wiues to take, to them is heer exprest: At burials they might not come, ne feed of rented beast. The xlv. Chapiter. Elect apart foure portions were within the holy land: For Preestes, for Prince, for Cittie and Churche, eche lot set out with wand. A lesson giuen to Magistrates for measure and for weight: Oblations eke how them to make, is heer set out ful streight. The xlvi. Chapiter. For sacrifice on Saboth dayes, the order heer they knowe: In temple where the folke came in, ther out they might not go. The Prince in middle of them all, must be when God they serue: Til he go out a charge they haue, from him they may not swarue. The xlvii. Chapiter. God dooth him shew the ples?t stremes that from the gates should run: What plentie of fishe should therin be, for fisher men to come. On sides wherof what trees should grow that monthly frute should bear: The borders of the holy land, it is appointed there. The xlviii. Chapiter. Heer now by lot is pointed out, eche tribe how he should lie: The preestes and Leuites haue their parts the holy temple by. Whose portion eke is pointed out, and all the Citties shore: The Prince again his part is tolde, this Prophet speakes no more. FINIS. Thus haue you heard this Prophet speak, vnto the people tho: That captiues were in Caldey land, and vnto sundry mo. Now commeth in that man of wit, a Seer you may say: VVho tolde before of Monarchies, their reign and their decay. The Romaine power he telleth of, of Turk and Antechriste: Of golden dayes that should be seen, in regiment of Christe. His name to tel is Daniel, that deemed doughtie dreames: VVho stil did win of enemies, for all their craftie meanes. The Prophecy of Daniel. The first Chapiter. And when the King of Babilon, Hierusalem had wun: Yung men of Iewes for to be kept, he willed to be doon. Their fare was set they it refusde, and eat and drank ful hard: Yet were they fair and wisdome had none were to them comparde. The ii. Chapiter. But Daniel, there was not one, could tel the King his dream: Who tolde it him and this therto, the truthe what it did mean. For whiche he was a ruler made, the cheef and next the King: His fellowes three did rule also, to whiche he did them bring. The iii. Chapiter. Commaunded were the multitude an Image to adore: Sidrach, Misach, Abednago, would not to die therfore. Into an ouen then were they cast, aliue with one they walkt: The King it saw and cald them out, and with them freendly talkt. The iiii. Chapiter. Dream did the King another dream, whiche Daniel did expound: How that the King for his great pride, as Oxe should feed on ground. And that seuen yeeres, the whiche he did, and after ruled again: Confessing God to haue the might, and he alone to reign. The v. Chapiter. Euen as before a prideful Prince, came now again in place: Who proudly drank in holy place, and saw before his face, A hand did write vpon a wall, whiche Daniel tolde ful plain: The Medies and the Persians, shoule rule when he was slain. The vi. Chapiter. Ful mightie power had Daniel tho, the Princes did him hate: In Lions den they got him cast, but nought by it they gat: He was preserued, they were deuourd, their families and all. King Darie gaue commaundement, on Daniels God to call. The vii. Chapiter. Great beastes were seen in number fours of Daniel in his bed: By vision he this sight did see, whiche troubled sore his head. Foure Monarchies these beastes did shew their hornes were kingdomes ten: In latter dayes God by his sonne, he should destroy them then. The viii. Chapiter. He now dooth see a mightie Ram, whose force none could resist: But with his hornes he ruled all, and did euen what him list. The Medies and the Persians, they were the Ram so whot: The Grecian power did them destroy compared to a Gote. The ix. Chapiter. In this place Daniel dooth desire, that that whiche Ieremy said: Might be fulfild and then confesse his sin he did and prayd. The prayer is heard, the seuentie weeks the Angel did expound: The Cittie is built, and Christe is born, to them that did him wound. The x. Chapiter. King Cirus ruling Persia, the third yeer of his reign, A man clothed in linnen white, appeerd to him again, And tolde him things that were to come, at whiche he was abasht: But that Gods Angel made him strong, his countenance had dasht. The xi. Chapiter. Like as before so now again, of Kings to him is tolde: The Persian power, the might of Greece, and eke of Egipt bolde: Of Siria as some suppose, and last of Romaines might. These kingdomes all not one to faile, against the Churche should fight. The xii. Chapiter. Michael then that mightie Prince, shall stand for to defend, The Churche of Christe the general day the troubles quite shall end, Wherin to blisse some shall arise, and some to bitter pain: Some shall their faultes amend before, and some in sin remain. FINIS. Daniel now his minde hath said, as God to him did tel: His sight he had in things to come, all others did excel. The Iewes that in captiuitie, in Caldey land did dwel: He them reueald with ioyful speeche, deep sorowes to expel. Hosea he dooth followe next, who then did prophesie: VVhen Israel quite from their King, Rehoboam did flie. He tolde them of their seruice vain, in Bethel vnto calues: How vain it was vnto suche Gods, to seek for helthful salues. Three score and ten they were his yeeres to ten tribes that he preacht: Say what he could they mended not, they scorned that he teacht. The vengeance due for sinful life, he vouched to be sure: And mixt among Gods mercies great, by it them to allure. To worship God as law did wil, set out by him aboue: And leauing all their owne intents, so should they haue his loue. The Prophecy of Hosea. The first Chapiter. A Harlot he is wild to wed, of whom he sonnes begat: The whorishe life of Israel, is signified by that. The Gentiles should be called in, Gods people for to be: And all the tribes should ioyne in one, and louingly agree. The ii. Chapiter. Because with Ball they did commit moste filthy whordome, so, The Prophet them dooth threat for it, God foorth their filth to shew. Except that they repent and mend: whiche if they doo, that then As spoused wife moste husband like, he would them looue as when, The iii. Chapiter. Cast of (he saith) the Iewes should be as drunk with Gods ful vain: To take a harlot he is wild, to shew the thing again. That King or preest they should not haue and that for many dayes: And yet at l?gth Christ should them saue to whom they should giue praise. The iiii. Chapiter. Declare he dooth how sin did reign, and none mislikte the same: Bothe Princes, people, and the preestes in sinning had no shame. Wherfore he threates that God wil strike and punishe them therfore. So that to Idols sacrifice, they should doo so no more. The v. Chapiter. Eftsoones the sinnes he dooth tel out, of Israel by name: From moste to least they mended not, to God their liues to frame. God should they seek, then would he not of them again be found: Of other power for ayd they should, and so themselues confound. The vi. Chapiter. Ful fast to God they did then hie, repenting of their il: So knowledge they should haue to do, that God to them did wil. The Prophets spared not to cut, their sin with words so sharp: The preestes to steale by one consent, no other thing they carp. The vii. Chapiter. Gone all astray the people were their King they did disceiue: As Bakers ouen so burned they, in unto whiche they cleaue. Their trust they had in Egipt help, shall not them help in deed: They turned them but not aright when that they were in need. The viii. Chapiter. How they a King and rulers eke, did chuse but not by God: And Idols vain did cleaue vnto, whiche he had them forbod. For whiche their sin he wil them pay to teache them to offend: With fier their Cittie shalbe burnt, to Egipt shall they wend. The ix. Chapiter. In leading of an whorishe life, an hunger shall they haue: They said the Prophet was a fool, the spirituall men did raue. Their wombs and brestes should dried be, their children long not liue: And for a pray vnto their foes, he would them also giue. The x. chapiter. King ouer them they should haue none their Idols should be stroyd Bothe Iuda and Samaria they should be sore anoyd. To plough and reap in righteousnes and mercy they are wild: If not betime in the morning, their King he should be kild. The xi. Chapiter. Louingly from Egipt land, he saith that he them led: And cherisht them with food therto, and gaue them heauenly bread. Ful lothe he is to punishe them, though it they doo deserue: Thou Ephraim misvsde it self, yet Iuda did not swarue. The xii. Chapiter. Muche crookednes did Ephraim vse, with Iuda dooth he talke. As Iacob liu'de and pleased God, so would he haue them walke. In tabernacles they should dwel, as in their solemne feastes: Because they serued not their God, nor did regard his heastes. The xiii. Chapiter. No end they made of woorshipping their Idols and their calues: Yet God their God remayneth God, none els for sin hath salues. Yet Lion like he wil them vse, but so as for a time, The death of death he saith to be, and bring them down that clime. The xiiii. Chapiter. Of Israels return he telth, how forren power they leaue: They doo confesse they did transgresse, now vnto God they cleaue. Who wil th? blesse &amp; make them growe, whose braunches shall so shed: That others shall return by them, and lack the life they led. FINIS. Hoseas heer hath tolde his minde, a Prophet ful of zeale: And Ioel now beginth to speak, Gods counsel to reueale. The Prophecy of Ioel. The first Chapiter. A famine he dooth tel to come, their frute for to destroy: He wilth y? dr?kards for to mourn, their throtes should be ful dry. Their wine, their oyle, their wheat and corn should be destroyd w? blasting: Therfore he wilth them to proclaim, a common prayer and fasting. The ii. chapiter. Beholde a power shall come on them, to ruine and to waste: Therfore to turn and to repent, he willeth them make haste. And then the Lord to them wil turn, and blesse them in his looue: Their sonnes &amp; daughters shal haue giftes signes shalbe from aboue. The iii. chapiter. Controle he wil the enemies, that had destroyd his land: And serue them so as they had doon, when they had them in hand. Let Iuda now make spear and sheeld, let Gentiles quake and fear: The Lord him self wil pitche the field, Hierusalem to cheer. FINIS. Thus Ioels tale is finished, three Chapters ful of lore: Now Amos dooth asmuche contain, and twice so many more. The Prophecy of Amos. The i. Chapiter. Amos hee did Prophecy, in Ieroboams dayes Damascus and the Philistins shall perishe as he sayes. Tirus and Idumea, the like shalbe their lot: And Ammon for his crueltie, whiche was the sonne of Lot. The ii. Chapiter. Because of Moabs crueltie, against the Edomites: Bothe he and Iuda for their factes shall see ful woful sights. The Israelites for careles spoile, shall flee before their foes: What woorks for them the Lord had wrought he breefly to them showes. The iii. Chapiter. Can any thing be wrought or doon, but God dooth woork the same? His Prophets that doo prophecy, they doo it in his name. That Israel shalbe destroyd, by Egipt God dooth tel: Samaria and Bethel eke, shall haue their fee as wel. The iiii. Chapiter. Down wil he throw their rulers eke, for spoyling of the poore: They thought by outward holines, to scape so sharp a shoure. By famin and great scarsitie, by pestilence and swoord, He punisht them: it would not serue, to bring them to his woord. The v. Chapiter. Euil hap should fall on Israel, for them he dooth lament: Leaue of from wrong he willeth them, with speed for to repent. It wil not serue their sacrifice, ne burning of incence: When Iudgem?t runnes as water flud he wil with them dispence. The vi. Chapiter. Ful plesantly their Princes liu'de, deliting all in ease: With meat and drink and melody, thus they them selues did please. Therfore the Lord did swear their end, they trusted in their strength: As captiue men they should be led therfore away at length. The vii. Chapiter. Giue signes he dooth by Grashoppers, by fire and lined wall. That God would stroy the Israelites, and ouerthrowe them all. Amaziah vnto the King, of Amos did complain, And him rebukte, but he him tolde what therby he should gain. The viii. Chapiter. He yet again dooth tel the heads, how they the poor oppresse: And vsed shameful robbery, in making measures lesse, For whiche they should be ouer run, and perishe with the swoord: A famine he would send on them, the wanting of his woord. The ix. Chapiter. If all the wayes they seek they can, yet shall they not put by: But bothe the temple and themselues, he wil them bothe destroy. Yet wil he sift as in a siue, his chosen from the rest And home they shall return again, and liue in quiet rest. FINIS. This Shepheard he hath tolde his minde, that came from keeping sheep: Now Obadiah dooth come in, to comfort them that weep. The Prophecy of Obadiah. The first Chapiter. A Prophecy he dooth declare, against the Edomites For vexing of their Uncles kin, in their malitious spites. And when that they destroyed be, for hurting Iacob so: Then shall the Churche ful quiet be, and rid from all their wo. FINIS. So dooth this Prophet end his woords, more speeche he dooth not vse: Now Ionas you shall hear to tel, to Niniuie her newes. The Prophecy of Ionas. The first Chapiter. As God him bad he would not do, but fled another way: In ship, a tempest did arise they cast him in the sea. In dooing so they pardon axt, a Whale did him deuoure: Three dayes and nightes the fishes womb was vnto him a boure. The ii. chapiter. Being thus of the fishe possest, his prayer he did make: Protesting suche as followe lies, Gods mercies they forsake. But Ionas saith that he wil pay the vowes he took in hand: As God did wil, so did the Whale this Prophet cast on land. The iii. chapiter. Commaunded was he once again, to Niniuie to shew: In fortie dayes they mending not, God would them ouerthrowe. A fasting then proclaymed was, the King and they repented: For mending of their former life, God stayd that was inuented. The iiii. Chapiter. Displeased greatly Ionas was, that Niniuie was sparde: Without the Cittie in a boothe, ther angerly he farde. A gourd sprang vp and shaded him, that it decayd he chod: For Niniuee he cared lesse, so is he tolde of God. FINIS. Heer Ionas book is finished, in chapters foure set out: Now Michah shall appeer to you, the same we go about. The Prophecy of Michah. The first Chapiter. As God him bad he spareth not but plainly dooth he tel: That down should go the kingdoms bothe of Iuda and Israel. This was the cause Idolatrie, that foully they did vse. For whiche the power of forren folke, should them and theirs abuse. The ii. Chapiter. Because the mightie men did spoile, the poor of house and feeld: He telleth them God would them plagin their foes should make them yeeld. They wantonly did mock and skorne, the preachers that did preache: He that of wine would preache to them, he best of all did teache. The iii. Chapiter. Cry out he dooth against the heds, that did the people spoile And sayth their cry it should be heard, when they should haue the foile. Their Prophets did for money preache, the rulers built in blood: Their glorious state shuld therfore down in Gods displeasing mood. The iiii. Chapiter. Deuine he dooth that Christe his Churche shall floorishe ouer all: And that far of to serue the Lord, one shall another call. Their worldly cares &amp; warlike minde, shall quite be laid aside: Though some conspire their ouerthrow, it shall not so betide. The v. chapiter. Ere that they should attain this peace, muche troubles should they haue: Hierusalem with all her power, her self shee should not saue. But Bethlehem Ephraita, that little was in sight, A Captain foorth should bring to them, of endles power and might. The vi. Chapiter. For them what God had doon he telth, therby them to prouoke, That righteousnes they might embrace, and were an humble yoke. False weightes &amp; mesures they did vse, the people to deceiue: Therfore the poyson of their frutes, with labour lost should leaue. The vii. Chapiter. Greatly now dooth he mourn, because so few did fear the Lord: No trust in freend could then be found, their liues were to vntoward. But yet he wilth the foes to stop, to rage against his flock: Affirming God to keep his graunt, to Abram and his stock. FINIS. The minde of Michah you haue heard, a tale ful plain he tolde: Now Nahum speaks to Niniuie, a Prophet sharp and bolde. The Prophecy of Nahum. The first Chapiter. Almightie Lord is God in deed, his power it passeth all: All loftie things he can destroy, and keep his freends from thrall. The wicked shall consumed be, that Iuda did molest: So should their feastes be kept again, and they should liue in rest. The ii. Chapiter. Beholde as Iacob was destroyd, so should th'Assirian power: The Caldies should with force &amp; might, their land and them deuour. Their Queen as captiue should be led, their treasures quite bereft: Their mightie men so Lionlike, to them should not be left. The iii. Chapiter. Cast down God wil the Niniuites, that slowed so in pride: The glory that that Cittie had, it should be set aside. Their multitude should not them help, nor mighty men them ayd: Their Cittie burnt, their land destroyd the wrath should not be stayd. FINIS. VVhat Nahum said to Niniuie, to you hath been exprest: Now Abacuck his Prophecy, it com'th among the rest. The Prophecy of Abacuck. The first Chapiter. All wickednes did flowe at fil, no sinful life did want: The law put by and righteousnes, among them then was scant. Because the godly went to wrack, the Caldeys God would raise: To teache them fishe as fishers doo, and make of them their prayes. The ii. Chapiter. Be bolde of this ye prideful men your pride shall come ful lowe: But righteous men by faith shall liue, your fall the world shall knowe. The couetous and blooddy men, the drunkards in his ire, The Idoll and the worshipper, shalbe consumde with fire. The iii. Chapiter. Call vnto God the Prophet dooth, and for his Churche dooth pray: Describing God his maiestie, in power to passe for ay. Beseeching him his foes to strike, with mercy to correct His chosen flock, and thus he ends, his book to muche effect. FINIS. Thus Abacuck hath tolde his tale, ful boldely to the Iewes: And Sophoniah commeth next, to tel them the same newes. The Prophecy of Sophoniah. The first Chapiter. All liuing things the Lord wil stroy, with man for his offence: And Iuda and Hierusalem, should haue their recompence. A woful ruine wil he make, for halting in their faith: Their strength, their goods, shuld not th? help but perishe they should he saith The ii. Chapiter. Before his wrath doo come in deed, he wilth them to repent: The kingdomes of the Philistines, for sin it should be rent. The Moabites the Ammonites, for ioying Israels fall, With Morians and Niniuites, should be destroyed all. The iii. Chapiter. Corrupted were the Iudges all, the preestes and Prophets vain: Not one would mend what so was said, nor turn to God again. The Gentiles shall conuerted be, the remnant of his flock Shall turn again and liue in peace, and be a faithful stock. FINIS. Sophoniah thus he hath said, as God did wil him speak: Now Haggay with his mouth vnclosde, his minde to you shall break. The Prophecy of Haggay. The first Chapiter. All hope was past for to return, from Babilon again: God plagued them &amp; al their frutes their labours were in vain. He found great fault they builded so, and that his house was down: And willed them with speed to build his temple and his town. The ij. Chapiter. Beholde the glory of the house, whiche Salomon did build, Should not be like to this (he saith) nor no suche beautie yeeld. God wil them blesse with plenteousnes if they wil patient bee: Their foes shall fall but they shall reign and come to hie degree. FINIS. Haggay hath tolde his tale, and made the people glad: Zachariah ye shall haue next, as yee the rest haue had. The Prophecy of Zachariah. The first Chapiter. Again to God if they would turn, he would turn vnto them: Or els as to their forefathers, so would he doo to them. Hierusalem shalbe new built, by vision it is tolde: The careles heathen shalbe shent, for wasting of his folde. The ij. chapiter. Beholde of this, the temple shall be built again in deed: An Angel did the same declare, and that they should not dreed. For God would be their ful defence, and vnto them a wall, And bring their foes to be their pray, no power withstand them shall. The iii. Chapiter. Corrected was Sathan the Deuil, that would the woork haue let: And Iohosuah that was hie Preest was specially out set. His flithy clothes were made ful fair, if he wil walke aright: The multitude shall him obay, and haue in him delight. The iiii. Chapiter. Declare on foorth the Angell dooth, by vision ful plain: Hierusalem in goodly wise, should be set vp again. Who should it build how foes should sin, and freends should somewhat faint But God his woork should fortifie by Christe his holy saint. The v. Chapiter. Euil hap and curse shall fall on these, the swearer and the theef: A flying book shall them consume, and theirs for their mischeef. As Iuda had afflicted been, in Babel for their gilt: So Babel now like smart should haue, and vtterly be spilt. The vi. Chapiter. Foure Monarchies by charets foure, he dooth describe to come, As sent from God to rule the world, by whom it should be wun. The hie preest had his golden crownes, Iehosua by name: And he the building should set out and will a noble fame. The vii. Chapiter. God dooth their fasting disalow, their mourning was in vaine They eat and drank vnto them selues, they stil did gape for gain. When he did call they would not hear, his statutes to obay: They shall cry out but he shall turn, his ear from them away. The viii. Chapiter. He wil restore them home again, and stay his wrathful rage: They shall ful long there rest in peace, enioying stanes for age, Deceit and wrong they must forsake, forswearing eke deste: The Gentiles shall their lore wel like, and thervnto apply. The ix. Chapiter. In wrathful mood for all their pride, he wil the Gentiles waste: Bothe Tire and Zidon in their welth, he wil them ouer cast. But sure his churche he wil defend, by Christe his sonne so meek: Bee lowely sitting on an Asses back yet shall they to him seek. The x. chapiter. Knowe heer you may what Idols be, soothsayers foolishe art: To Iuda he wil freendly be, and fully take their part. To Ephraim he wil fauour shew, and giue to them suche might: That forren power they shall not fear but shall put them to flight. The xi Chapiter. Lowe will he bring them in his wrath, bothe shepheards and their sheep, Because they had no more respect his statues for to keep. The shepherds wagis it is paid, and thirtie peeces tolde: The potter had it giuen to him, so was our master solde. The xii Chapiter. Meruaylously the Lord wil woork, for Iuda in his power: Hierusalem shall plagued be, her foes shall it deuour. Yet shall they bothe great fauour finde, and come to happy cace: Their foes shall faint but they shall ioy, and finde a resting place. The xiii. Chapiter. No more wil God think on their sin, their Idols shall away: Their Prophets false they wil destroy, their parents shall them pay: The shepheard should so stricken be, that scatter should the sheep. The people then to God shall flee, ful wel he wil them keep. The xiiii. Chapiter. Opprest should be Hierusalem, and be set vp again. Muche people shall to her resorte, the way it shalbe plain. The moste of them that hated her, consumde shalbe and slain: And those that come not to her feast, shall want their yeerly reign. FINIS. Thus Zachary is finished, novv Malachy shall speak: The last he is that to the levves, the minde of God did break. He and the tvvo that spake before, the Ievves did comfort giue: VVhen they thought least then home to go in peace and rest to liue. Til Iohn did come that did Baptize, no Prophet did appeer: This Prophets speaks vnto the Preeste, his vvoords novv let vs hear. The Prophecy of Malachy. The first Chapiter. A louing minde to Israel alwayes the Lord did hear, And yet both they &amp; eke their preestes they had of him no fear. The aulter and his table bothe, they past not to abuse: Polluted things they offer did, on gain their hartes did muse. The ii. Chapiter. Because they did their office il, their blessing he wil curse: Their parent first did not so wel, but they did mickle wurse. Their mariages they were amisse, their hart was not aright: Therfore despisde, God let them be and that in eche mans sight. The iii. Chapiter. Come speedely shall Christe in deed but Iohn shall come before: And wrongful life shall passe away, God shall good life restore. The prosperous state of wicked men, did somewhat them molest: But at the length they should wel see that God did them detest. The iiii. Chapiter. Doutles the day shall come (saith hee) that God the proud wil burn: But saue he wil the faithful men, whiche vnto him do turn. Eliah he shall come before, Iohn Baptist it dooth mean: Who shall the sonnes and fathers teach their hartes for to be clean. FINIS. The Prophets thus are finished, and books Cononicall: Apocripha ye shall haue next, if death doo not me call. Then some I hope wil finishe that, whiche my good wil began: All shall be one in me or him, so that you haue it than.</field>
