      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ESQ??. AND ROBERT SOUTHEY, LLD. Bards of immortal fame, in virtue high As in bright genius! In a noble heart Is worth, above all genius, and all power. All that by labour can be done, is naught,— And all by skill and artifice! The spell Lies in the sentiment; the steam of truth, That issues from the fountain of the soul Involuntary!—it is intellect By the heart warm'd, elated, soften'd, mellow'd! Be curses on the flowers of poetry! They are but idle, childish ornaments,— Or rather meretricious! The great soul Disdains them. By an inward light impell'd, It echoes forth the voice of spiritual truth; Nor in material beauty seeks its praise. To live amid the troubles of the world, And learn no wisdom, is a life of scorn: And not to glow amid the scenery Of its stupendous beauty'; and not to burn With indignation at the crimes and follies Of its half-earthborn, half-celestial habitants, Beneath our better nature is to sink! The majesty of high and daring thought, The charm of a refin'd and melting bosom, The force of piercing faculties of mind, Call forth the admiration of the enlighten'd, The just, and sound.—To think and meditate, And rightly and unselfishly to judge, And sympathise with human misery, And mercy shew to man's unwilling frailties; But tear the veil from curs'd hypocrisy;— And meditated breach of faith, and robbery, To Hell's enduring torments to consign,— This, this, becomes the Muse.—She then her strain Lifts, as a lesson to direct the paths Of straying mortals! With the daily tasks, And daily passions, of mankind she deals! And not a dreamy, mystic, sickly note She pours, which girls in a factitious humour May wonder at, and weep upon, in vain! It is the Sage's lore, that the ambition Of manly genius only will aspire to;— What teaches us to muse with rectitude Upon th'events of ages gone away; And by the aid of bright imagination Revive the past, and bring the dead to life! Once more before the judgment-seat array'd, The spirits of antiquity come forth, And to the censure of succeeding times, From transient passions free, their acts submit! All wealth is in the mind;—without the mind This scene of things is barren. 'Tis the sentiment, And thought annex'd, that only give it worth; And thought without emotion is but empty, Uncertain, and more subtle oft than wise! Defend me from an idle play of words, And glittering images, that tell no truth! From metaphor, and simile, and dress Illustrative of what is stale and hollow! We want the substance; not a worthless figure, By gaudy and false ornaments disguis'd! And thus I close my dedicative lay; For too prolix the following strains have been.— —So fate ordains it!—I have drank the cup Of bitterness and wrong, e'en to the dregs! And now let Calumny', and hell-scaping Scorn Fall foul on me again, and fix their fangs Upon my wounded heart!—it still will beat Mid purer air, and with untam'd emotions Glow, and ascend on fancy's wings, to bask On banks of waterfalls Elysian, Beneath the fire of empyrean air! Then hail, ye glorious Pair, in sympathy Of virtue, as of genius, ever fam'd! And as, in candour, ye have breath'd of old Your cheers to me, which charm'd away despair, Bless me once more with your life-waking voices! Thus on the verge sixty-nine sad years I yet may fearlessly the lyre resound, And On the Tombs of mighty Bards of yore Sing hymns, that shall their airy Spirits soothe! S. E. B. Friday morning, 30 Sept. 1831. THE LAKE OF GENEVA. BOOK I. O lake most beautiful, thou art become Now as a home to me! Time has united The sight of thee with many a feeling fond, And many a bright idea past; and thou The mellow mirror art that throws them back Fairer than when they first within me sprung! But not to me alone;—to all the world These years have of tremendous import been. How many a noble heart, which once I knew, Sleeps in the dust, since first upon mine eyes The grandeur of thy glassy waters broke. It is not wonderful that thou wert chosen, Nearly two thousand years ago, the seat Of those Burgundian Kings, who made their inroad On Rome tyrannic. Ever since in story Thy name has shone, and thy rich tale is full Of mighty incidents, beyond my strength, Or few remaining years, with clearness due To narrate. I would rather tell how grand Thy mountains, clad in snow, upon thee hang: But I have nothing of the Sage's lore, In natural science learned. My delight Has been to trace the movements of the mind And heart of man: and much of this shall I Ere half my task is finish'd, have to say On this deep-searching topic; for with thee, Yes, on the tumbling issue of thy torrent, Was born Rousseau, of man's immingled being One of the magic wonders;—of the soul And moral conscience the enigma strange! But not to him alone shall be my song Confin'd: a beadroll of full many a name Of worthies, that will dignify the verse, Shall be recall'd to memory, and with due And clear appropriate praise be fondly sung. For I have travel'd in the tale of Man, And from my very earliest boyhood sought Th'events, the feelings, and the tracts of brain, That mark'd all those who in the roll of fame Have been well register'd: and in that roll A few of lustre high have on thy banks, O Lake most lovely, most sublime, been nurs'd, Or spent their lives of virtuous mental labour. From Jura's heights, just as the setting sun Upon Mont-Blanc his rosy beams reflected, I first beheld thee, O most beautiful Expanse of waters! My worn heart was then Bursting, and the confusion of my head As if its light was in the gloomy grave About to close: for I had many a year In mingled tempests been conflicting wild With public duties, and with private wrongs; And disappointment, insult, most audacious Fraud, was th' heart—breaking consequence of all. But when the most sublime of Nature's views Burst all at once upon my wearied soul, 7 Sept. 1818. A being new shone in me, and I wish'd Again to live, and to enjoy this breath Of mortal tenement I would put off. Dark was the night ere we could reach the walls Of thy fair City—and the gates were clos'd, To ope no more till morn. Then, Secheron, Thy over-crowded mansion, after long Intreaties, under its protecting roof Received us, and the feversish night, of heat Intense, counting the hours, we linger'd through. The streets of London seem'd as they had poured Their wellknown habitants upon the spot! But not so far had travel'd I to see The common faces of my last sad years! Peace, solitude, and mild forgetfulness I sought, or if oblivion were not mine, Then the materials of my loaded brain To turn upon the future, and by new Associations a new form to give! Now close upon thy banks I chose my haunt, Dear Leman, and from the turmoil of Man's Society, sick at heart, shut myself out. But then the past would deep intrude again; And deep I meditated; yet more deep Upon the future; and I call'd in fiction To while the hours away; and every morn I scribbled the inventions, that the calm Of night had work'd upon my busy mind; And thus an hundred fables in my tablets' Recorded stand; and sometimes to their length I drew them out; and strove to move the hearts Of sympathetic readers with the images That haunted my own fancy. My weak frame Could scarce sustain the conflict in the cauldron, Where all the elements of head and heart In tumult work'd together. My mov'd blood Diseases nurs'd, that on the springs of life Prey'd, and extinction nearly had effected. Then rose those complex causes of the ill, Which never since has left my afflicted body. And not thy salutary Baths, St.-Gervais, Could purge away the poison! It was fix'd Deep in the purple veins of my earth's being— And will away no more! But in that haunt Of loneliness, where every morn I saw The sun rise o'er the Lake, and distant barge Offer its white sails to the misty gleam, Of wisdom much I learn'd, as much I thought; With bent intense upon the wealth of nations I ponder'd day and night; and something drew From this unbroke abstraction of pure mind, Which will not soon forgotten be, although Noticed by few; and still but little known. But long, long, years, after the seed had fallen Dead in the soil, as I conceiv'd, surpris'd, And with delight my wondring eyes have found That it had taken root, and had expanded Into an healthful produce, and was spreading From day to day. Then came the sweet reward; And the heart soften'd and grew calm and good; And self-complacence, in which mood are nurs'd Our kindliest virtues, smiling sat within. We cannot feel benevolence, while none, We think, are kind to us. I well remember How unabated was the toil I gave, And how in cold and dark December's depths, Three hours before the light I rose, and by The cheering flame of wood my studies plied, And drove the current of my worn-out plume. Then I had done a good day's work, ere others Had left their beds; and to my morning walk Betook me with a conscience pleas'd, and sought The city for its books and for its news. Of living beings I convers'd with few; For few were my acquaintance; and with eye Askance the busy worldlings look'd on me. I had no manners for the world; reserv'd And cold was my address; and freezing thoughts Seem'd to come slowly from my'embarrass'd lips. But there was fire within; tho frost without:— By that which was without the world had judg'd, And ever will judge so. And thus it was, That while by irritability extreme, And the incessant boilings of my head, The chiefest evils of my life had come, My seeming coldness bred vindictive hate. But many a year have I a citizen Of the wide world been since, and many a clime And nation have I seen; and many a change Of life and manners, and full many a scene Of nature's beauties; and my head and hand Have oped themselves to many a head and hand Of other countries; and in my old age A cheer is come at last, which has unbent My gloomy brow, and breath'd on my chill voice A lively tone, and op'd my frozen lips, As the sun melts the icy bonds that chain The winter waters; and at last my tongue Babbles as rapid as those torrents run Beneath the blaze of the sun's burning rays! Perchance it is a flow of wild and wearying, Rude, unconsider'd matter—caught from lights That for the moment dart, then fly away, And never more upon those objects rest;— Perchance it is the colouring of passion, Unjust and hurtful there where good should be Intended and bestow'd, and with sharp dart Pierces, or with a barbed arrow wounds. Slow, and considerate, and weighing deep All consequences, and all chance of ill, The cautious talker tells us what is naught. It is a selfish baseness, that conceals Opinion. Give it not the name of Candour! It is a habit, that grows, and still grows, Till the poor barren mind becomes a blank, And sand, and sand, is put upon it, till It has no surface but white worthless atoms. If ebullition of quick thoughts produce Injustice, then restraint becomes a duty: But the reserve, which has its origin In calculation of self-injury, Is a most odious baseness, which would damp The energies of the most noble heart. The free communion of enlighten'd mind, Sagacious, penetrating thought, confession Of unsophisticated moves of heart, Conviction, the result of complex powers Of all the faculties when most abundant, Most strain'd together,—of that inspiration Which only genius knows;—which is not borrow'd, And therefore may not elsewhere be obtain'd; The bright thought suddenly by strong collision Struck at an accidental dart; the fire Communicative, from another caught;— These form the charm intense of social life. Solitude has its charms, and its great uses; But so has social life, when well selected: It quickens our best intellectual powers; And mends our hearts, and teaches matter rich, And of discernment nice, which not from books Or solitary musing can be learn'd. There are full curious inexhaustible Stores of instructive knowlege floating ever Upon men's lips, which not the pen or type Has ever register'd, or ever can! Loose and inaccurate full oft the babble Of ignorance or vanity; but judgment Selects, arranges, sifts; or gets a clue By which the workings of his proper mind Arrive at truth. Thus men who have convers'd Much with the world, are ready, sharp, exact, And by comparison with thoughts of others, Are less expos'd to strange hallucinations, Which find no test or compass in themselves. There is a partial blindness,—some weak spot,— I' th' individual sight of half mankind: But then there is a range in solitude For the mind's grandest visions, and the view O' th' human countenance in its arch smile; Its love of the ridiculous; its actual Encumberment of matter; and the call Of prompt attention to all visible things, Reins in imagination, and weighs down By earthly particles the mounting scale. Thus solitary genius is the most Sublime,—and social most acute and witty, Sagacious, and exact, and in the daily Conduct of life, the surest guide to wisdom. It is the intermingled course, which leads To the mind's highest efforts, and best fruits. But I have wander'd from my subject far; And must to thee, O Lake belov'd, return! When the spring came, along the little garden I pac'd, that by thy fickle waves was wash'd, And view'd the budding flower, and felt the beam Of renovating suns, and still beheld With wistful eye the beamy sail descend From where Lausanne's bright turrets in the rays Of golden Phœbus glitter'd; on the bank Oppos'd, by Jura's frowning Mountains back'd, Smil'd many a beautiful and varied villa, Hanging their green shrubs o'er the azure waves. There the light boat is dancing on the Lake, And dashes many an oar, and throws the spray Panting, and many a petty sail is spread To court the expiring breeze; and here and there The tones of music, and the gentle voice Sound sweetly on the bosom of the wave. Then came the midday dream; and Poesy Awak'd in all her exquisite emotions; And then the Tragic Tale went on,—and tears Profusely on the blotted paper flow'd; And the swell'd heart with virtues most refined, Most melancholy and most tender sighs, Work'd itself into temperaments unearthly. Oft to thy waters sparkling in the sun, Then dark again with clouds,—now smooth as plains, Then suddenly to mountain heights uprear'd, In frailest boats, with weak hands to the oar Quite inexperienced, did I entrust My worn-out frame, by mingled fever torn, Yet calm'd by courses new of meditation. Then oft across the burning heat uprose A sudden piercing blast, that in the mountain Gorges in secret bred, came like a thief I' th' night, and with its petrifaction chill'd The boiling blood. And now twelve years have pass'd, And yet the dire disorder reigns within, Now agitating, and now palsying This frame of eight and sixty years of pain. Oft on the waves beneath the blazing rays Upon my oars I rested: then the sun Shot vertical, and my dry brain was parch'd Beneath its fire. Disorder took its seat Within my veins, and I was sound no more. Now came the clime of Italy to soothe, But yet perchance my fever'd circulation With momentary calmness to deceive; For I once more was to the bed of sickness For three long months confin'd; and then again I labour'd hard in intellect, and search'd Thro regions dull and dry, yet intermix'd With bright imagination's moral range. Here the full blazon of the Arts to me Open'd in rapture, and delirium pass'd From my eyes to my melted heart, at view Of Painting and of Sculpture's magic powers. O Florence—nurse of Genius—birth-place lov'd Of modern poesy! Where Dante first Saw Heaven's sublimity upon his cradle Reflected; and where Milton, and where Gray Lighted the flames, that, sown in northern climes, Wanted the heat of more congenial suns!— With thee I linger'd many a month, tho' death Over me with his threatening arrow hung. But I escap'd then, as full thrice at least Since; and to thee, dear Leman, safe return'd Ere twenty months completely had elaps'd. Now broad upon thy blue expanse again I look'd; and right against the glittering villa Mounted on Cologny's vine-cover'd hills, Beneath the Alpine heights and proud Mont-Blanc, By Deodati's fond Miltonic name Hallow'd, and yet again on modern rolls With beams more brilliant blazing, by the memory Of mighty Byron's sojourn long, where all The Muse's charms were oped to his embrace. Thence on this Lake he frolick'd; thence in storms His rous'd soul, most delighted with thy waves To battle, and to hear the thunder roll, And his rent sails all shivering, and his mast Dire cracking in the roars and blasts of wind; Then cross the conflict of thy billows he To Coppet pass'd; and there a strife far other It was his lot to battle sharply with; —The conflicts of the mind; the strong collision Of mental wit, and readiness, and point, And art, and flow of words, and confidence, And vanity, and self-conceit inbred From childhood, and supremacy of thought Intense, historic, and political. But in that contest the unrival'd Bard, Whom every Muse enrich'd, yet paled his star, And moody at the consciousness of light Eclips'd, threw forth his fever'd frame aboard Into the boat, and as the breezes blew Growing into a storm, and the dark came, And billows dash'd, he plied his beaten oars Half in delight, and rose upon the wave, Then sunk again into the water's depths, In alternation, that half in delight, Half in defiance, sometimes with a gloom Of black despair, and sometimes with a laugh Of scorn at fate, that buffeted his body Thus, as his tempest-beaten heart,—arriv'd Safe at his haunt once more, where Milton's spirit Receiv'd him at the entrance; then fatigued, Lap'd in deep slumbers long he lay, the Muse Upon his bosom sitting, and with fondness Pouring her balm on his tempestuous heart. O sacred be those haunts, O beautiful Be every tint that on them soft and coolly Hovers! and be the air forever blest, And gardens, walks, and banks beheld with awe Mingled with love and fancy, and the swell Of bosom, that assures to higher being! For six long months daily as I awoke, And over the blue rippling waters saw The white walls glittering on the morning sun, My fond eyes with a sort of idol gaze Dwelt on them, and my' uncalm imagination Peopled them with a crew that ne'er on earth In truth were habitants:—but so it is; And in these wild delusions we are doom'd To live: and well it is, that we so live; For life without it would be barren, dull, And of a grossness unendurable. It was not yet the time of ill,—foreboding An early destiny to Byron's race: He yet was in the most abundant bloom Of his gigantic course, and pour'd along The torrent of his strains with endless strength; But four times had the sun his annual round Perform'd, since he had left that fam'd abode; And underneath Italian suns brought forth New splendors, the amaz'd and awe-struck world To dazzle, and half rapture, half dismay. O vile Venetian luxury! O poison Of cups Circæan! O the fall of mind, That in the body's selfish pleasures fades! But yet, O effluence indepressible Of pure and spiritual imagination! While wallowing in earthly vice, thy brain Was the seat of all noble sentiment, And visionary beauty and sublimity! And thy heart with ideal love was touch'd, Pure, and intense, and heavenly; and the while Could mingle pictures of a sensual world Plung'd in dark earthly sins, and seem to gloat With glee satanic on them, and to laugh With scorn triumphant on a fallen race! Nor, less initiated in the practice, Wast thou familiar with the foul ambition In vicious luxury to be a leader! Asham'd not, thy companions boon amid, To be the first of worldlings! Ill it sorted Thy most exalted genius to be thus Rival of coarse and brutal ignorance; Hardness of heart; of manners base; of birth Ignoble, only by corrupt, depraving Foul-got, and e'en perchance blood-colour'd wealth, Gilded! But we may reason as we will, Such was the union! The degrading vice None can deny, and there existed also The mind of heavenly breathing! To combine them May be a swerve from nature's rules; but there They were together found! How oft in that Seat of departed commerce, where the tides That all the streets transpierc'd, once wafted gold In countless heaps, and arts and arms and glory Together flourish'd, all by human toil, And human ingenuity,—didst thou Look back on Jura and the Alpine heights Of rosy-tinted proud Mont-Blanc; and sigh At nature's wonders, and the trembling Lake, And its night-closing tempests; and the ride Upon the tips of the white-foaming waves, And Coppet's lights, and Coppet's blaze of mind! Can thy waves once again, O Leman lov'd; Strength to my body give—for I am weak,— And my eyes fail me, and the opiate weight Comes over me of deep forgetfulness, And the rich page, which ought my mind to fill With keenest interest, falls from my hand. Thus in the day! but in the shades of night Still by the lamp I watch, and ply my task Week after week unwearied, and e'en month Succeeding month. Then Midnight's silence calm Befits the meditations of my brain; For much the turmoil of society, And much the talk of man, distracts my spirits: And much it agitates my morbid breast. There is a sharpness in thine air, that sometimes Pierces, and sometimes curdles up the blood, And stops the pores; and great the maladies Such interruptions cause; for on the free And even transit thro the tranquil veins Of the blest stream of life depends all health. Therefore the race that on thy banks has dwelt, Has ever somewhat irritable been, And somewhat moody; and was that not ill Suited to the capricious humours of The chief of all thy mental luminaries? But yet he stood alone; nor ever yet Did country more unlike its other habitants Produce a human Being!—O Rousseau! Thou wast the strangest, most intense, most beautiful, Most eloquent, most passionate, acute, Most fond, most selfish, most capricious, vain, Most wilful, most vindictive, and most cross'd With sudden unresisting yield to foul Base wickedness, as thou thyself confessest, That e'er combin'd in man's mysterious mould. E'en at the very crise, when Satan sat Triumphant on thy heart, the beams of Heaven Were shining in it:—clouds, and sun, and thunder, And lightning; and the intermingled rays Of love, of beauty, raptures, and the charms Of most celestial philanthropy!— It was not art which aided thee; thou wast The child of nature; not in Learning's tracks, By method, toil, instruction, didst thou gain Thy strength, or clearness, or concision, or Order of words, or springs of nascent thought! All was the gift of some inspiring Spirit, Which visited thine infant eyes, and breath'd Fire, strength, and tenderness, and th' fairest forms Of most unearthly beauty, to thy heart! E'en ere thy tottering steps could reach the banks Of the deep-purpled waves, thou must have had This wild delirium in thy wandring sight, And fluttering, dancing, boiling on thy breast. If thy weak fingers could have used the pen, And language had been thine, to paint and fix, Then in what brightness inconceivable Thy visions had been set! The forms around thee, —Material forms—had not in truth the colours— Nor essences thou wouldst have cloath'd them with;— But ne'ertheless they would not have been fram'd By fiction false; but did in truth exist To thy creative eye and flowing heart. The sun shone o'er the waves with brighter beams Than on the mingled mass of land: and more Of freshness as they beat and spray'd and sparkled, And worked themselves to purity by collision, Won on the senses, and evok'd the tribes Of Fairy habitants within the cells Of brain and bosom. O who had sagacity In this thy childhood, looking on thy face And delicate features, and thy slender frame, To presage ought above the common gifts Of vulgar children? On the rocky stone, The fickle billows dash'd, thy limbs were laid: And then with ear intent thou didst drink in The sounds, that on the wave came whispering down, Or sometimes shrieking. Airy spirits danc'd, Or slid along the surface of the blue, And green and white all mingled, of the waves; Or rose amid the glittering spray, and laugh'd And mock'd, and breath'd out magic syllables, And half display'd their limbs of exquisite And most etherial beauty, when thy boyhood, O'erdazzled, veil'd thine eyes, and in thyself Absorb'd and lost, sunk utterly regardless Of all without. Sometimes in search of thee, They, from whose care thine errant feet escap'd, Found thee still sleeping as th' advancing flood Gain'd on thy stony bed; and thou wouldst cry And fret and storm to be thus rudely wak'd Midst of thy golden slumbers! And thy nurse Would rate thee as a moody, cross-grain'd child, Of whom no good would come! and in disdain Thy little eye would fire, and thou wouldst stamp, And deal about thy puny blows, and rave With thy impetuous and half-stifled voice! And even then thou felt'dst the day would come When thou, the infant treated with despite And scorn for thy defaults, wouldst craze the world With beams of splendor, that the sober sense Of all, deem'd happier-gifted, would in vain Strive to repell or to endure!—'Tis thus That Genius ever feels: and thus it swells Against the vain and blind oppressor: thus It knows how folly, dulness, ignorance, Ever miscalculate; and dim presumption Thinks in the infant of stale common-place A prize to be well-hugg'd, and prais'd and flatter'd. How much hadst thou, Enchanter, in thy days Of boyhood, to oppress, disturb, and cross The opening of thy mind, to interrupt The laying-in of wisdom, and to mix Foulness and poison in the issuing streams Of tender, pure, and magic-mellow'd sentiment! But there was in its essence a bright spell, That threw off all th'impurities with scorn And might, and indignation, and untouch'd Stood in surrounding pools of dirt and vapour! A seer perchance might clearly have discern'd The rays that play'd around thee; but the veil Hung thick before the vulgar earthly sight: A trade mechanic could not dark the lamp That blaz'd within thee, and thy hands consign'd To labour for thy head; and fear of want, And despot brutal orders of a despot Master, unjust, capricious, ignorant, And unillum'd by casual gleams of mind. When the tir'd body has its organs press'd By the deranged current of the blood, How ill the mental faculties can work, Unless some blest supremacy of power O'ercomes the direful load! But the all-mounting Fire of true genius will pierce through, and rise, Spite of clouds, storms, and vapours, up to Heaven! It was not in society that thou Caught'dst the refinement of thy bosom's motions; For much of coarse was there: nor in the ranks Where wealth and education smoothe the manners, And elevate the thoughts, and purify The views, wert thou accustomed to have Thine infant ear delighted, or thy bosom Touch'd with the sweetness of habitual rule Of intellectual dominion! The eye of female beauty, elevated By birth, and in the school of Riches, form'd By wisdom's lessons, and the softening stores Of delicate and high imagination, Ne'er beam'd on thee the melting magic of Its irresistible irradiation: But all the glory, and the golden tints, Sky-borrow'd, came from thee, and on the object Of its deep idol-worship threw the blaze, Kneeling to deities of its own creation. But such is ever bright Imagination's Delusion dangerous! Shall we attribute Aught to thy clime, thy mountains, the expanse Of this thine azure mirror, by whose loveliness The splendor, and the beauty, and the rays Of beamy lustre, breaking but by fits Thro mountainous vapours, and sometimes a chill Of snow-clad summits, bosom'd in thick clouds Of Heaven, may have been on that breast of sun And tempests, then again in massy darkness Impress'd! O no! 'tis not to earthly causes That we must look: but 'tis the gift of heaven,— This high creative splendor, that within Works, and its forms and colours outward throws: But yet, though lakes and mountains and the sway Of nature's scenery in its most sublime And awe-engendering shapes and tints, cannot Originate th'internal faculty, Still it may nurse and fan and bring it forth; For in the heavy vapour of dull skies, And flat and fen-like countries, much I doubt, If genius ever can mount high, or duly Expand her wings. Along th'oerhanging skies Comes sweeping o'er the Lake the loud career Of tempests, bred the gorges deep among Of those enormous Alpine masses, clad In snow eternal, down whose craggy sides The roaring torrents fall, and intermix Their spray, that into ice-bound atoms turn'd, Add arrows to the loud careering stream, And sweep the gather'd pestilences bred I' th'air, and thro those clouds which o'er thy walls, Geneva, as o'er all th'abodes of man In congregated heaps, brood harmfully Passing—an healthful, airy, free, and sharp Atmosphere give it! O, how in the roar Of winter nights 'tis terrible;—but grand;— And braces up the spirits to delight. O then the' inhabitants of the vex'd sky In battle seem; and what a shrill loud shriek Does ever and anon the blast bring on To the astonish'd ear! Not three fleet months Have pass'd away, since thro the long black night I listen'd to this music of the spheres! For right against the torrent was th'abode Where on my bed of sickness I, awake, Told the long hours, and watching by the blaze Of cheerful lamp, my magic leaves unfolded, And wove my tales, and urg'd my weary pen! How oft I gan imagine that I could The language of the Winds interpret well: And tell the gusts of Anger from the shrieks Of sorrow;—and the murmur soft, between, Of Peace and Love with comment true intend! Then sometimes for a moment I believ'd The spirit of Rousseau himself was there, Or Milton, or of Gray: but morning light Drove them away: and down my bosom sank, And much of philosophic fortitude It call'd, to reconcile me to the flat Realities, that press'd upon my senses! But ere due manhood thou hadst reach'd, thy fate Led thee away from these thy native airs, O eloquent but dangerous Moralist; And little didst thou ever hear again The voices of the tempests, as they drove Their gathering torrents of soul-moving sounds Over old Leman's billows! the lov'd Muse, Whom I from babyhood have worship'd, frowns Upon my prayers, when I intreat his voice, The strange tale of thy wandring life to paint. She will not touch me with the hallow'd sweetness That duly can relate it; nor impart The piercing eye that to the mysteries Of thy yet undevelop'd breast can look! And she the movements magical and strange Has not the force to construe! I would tell The story of thy chequer'd days in order Successive, but my head, and pen, and voice Are all too weak!—And I must catch by fits Such lights and shadows, as irregular Will dart upon me! O thou fabulist Inspir'd of the new passionate Heloise! La Meillerai and Clarens from thy pencil Become th' abodes of dangerous magicians. But I must leave thee now, and I again Will at a future hour return to thee! How wert thou, Leman, in the days of old? The greatest of the Cæsars had thee once: Julius made thee sometimes his seat of rest, As northward he advanc'd to victory. The Church and civil viceroys of the Emperors Possess'd thee long, and with divided sway Govern'd thy harass'd people.— Counts of the Genevois, and despot Bishops, With iron rod in rivalry conflicting, Their subjects each tormented for the purpose Of paining each the other. Then the wretched Was punish'd twice—firstly for not obeying, And then again because he had obey'd! How deep into the night of Time these Counts, Imperial Viceroys, drew their origin, To poring antiquary is not yet Precisely known!—They were among the chief Nobles and Peers of Carlovingian days! And many a grand alliance with the Princes Of France, Helvetia, Italy, they made; And with puissant grandeur liv'd, and spread Widely their fame! nor were they wanting in Mildness of character and arts of peace, If sometimes to fierce actions thirst of rule, And irritation of the crosier's sway, Impell'd them! while a neighbouring encroacher, Savoy's ambitious Count, was ever pressing Upon their limits, sometimes by the sword, Sometimes by plot, sometimes by vile intrigue! And much more dreaded were they by the people, Than those they would displace; but after ages, At length their inextinguishable ambition Succeeded; and above a nobler House, More ancient, more benignant, they uprose; And o'er the shoulders of a tribe oppress'd Put their tyrannic paws, and bore them down! Then too the Church's feudal sceptre yielded To the same thirst of power and politic Adroitness, and proud Savoy's children grasp'd The mitre with the sword, and thus united Sat for three ages on the necks of those The habitants of thy magnific banks, O Lake, of which the Alpine side they yet Tyrannise over! But its chiefest line At length expires, e'en scarce a few brief weeks Before the feeble pen these lines records! But, Carignan, in a more liberal school We trust that thou wast cradled, and if power Superior does not crush the seeds of liberty, An happier policy may yet be thine! Harsh the dominion here of the long race Of thy historic grandsires! Many a deed Of savage, wanton, power disgrac'd their reigns Here, and in Chablais! Byron's Muse has told The horror-striking tale of Chillon's walls; And sufferings of heroic Bonnivard! Of the mix'd tissue of whose character, Curious the records Grenus has preserv'd. O false professors of an holy Faith! O ye in purple clad, with crosiers arm'd, Deeming religion but a cloak for power, And luxury and vice, how quick at last You push'd the downfall of your own dominion; And play'd the part of Luther and Melancthon, And all the fierce Reformers! Ye were blind, And in the sad delirium of your sensual Enjoyments to plain reason utterly Lost! and O thou the last of falling Rome's Deluded Bishops, who o'er these free walls Stretchedst thy rod, where were thine eyes and ears, And common judgment, when in sight of foes Advancing with so fierce and keen an onset Thou play'dst thy pranks, and with impunity Thoughtedst, (thy pleasures and thy wickedness Minging with insults unindurable,) By force to gratify. The daughter fair Of Lullin's ancient House thou dar'dst to seize, And kept'dst in tears and prayers and pale affright, At mercy of thy rude licentious love, Spite of the swords of heroes, and the cries Of parents, and the threats and bold assaults Of madden'd lovers! But not long the day, Ere came the ruin, so by crime enormous Provok'd! Then enter'd in the gaunt assailants, And fire and sword began to purify The haunts of idol crime and foul debauch, And blasphemous hypocrisy, and thirst Of the deluded wretch's wealth, and passion For worldly power by guile and falsehood won! But all was not unmingled good; abuse Of pious rites had gone its utmost length; And licence new, and open wickedness, Under the broad eye of the garish day, Revel'd in all the streets, and on thy banks, Breeze-breathing Leman! Not the searching air, That on thy rolling, whitening, waters came, Could waft it off! Thy sounds were in the breeze, That, speaking nature's voice, would sometimes awe The tender spirit. Beauty in the skiff, That danc'd upon thy glassy surface, borne, Felt all the mountain winds to brace her frame, And purify the veins that luxury In delicate mansions poisons:—but in vain! The eye licentious gaz'd; and she th'infection Caught!—And a quarter of an age was thus Approaching to its end, when Calvin came, Fierce, bigoted, uncandid, unrelenting, Demanding liberty of conscience, and Freedom of thought from Rome's usurp'd dominion Over the mind of Man, yet granting naught To others in return; for alledged errors In speculative doctrines blood demanding, And binding to the stake and burning flame! O horrid inconsistency! with goodness Impossible, as seems, to be combin'd! But still his name is venerated here; And much the good, 'tis urg'd, that he perform'd By harsh correction of corrupted manners, Which ne'er had yielded to a gentle rod! Yet why this persecution for opinions— For matters of mere faith? The moral rule Admits, perchance, no difference of thought, Of argument, or of authority:— Not so the nice perplexing points of faith!— Virtue and vice are still the same. But thou, O gloomy, fretful, gall-o'erloaded heart, Not so didst judge, or feel! Thou hadst no mercy For any course the subtle spirits took Of the mysterious brain, except for that To which thy mental travels led thyself: The whip, the prison, e'en the torture, were Too little for the punishment of him Who differ'd from thee! Surely it is strange, Beyond the comprehension of a mind Candid and consciencious, that the heart Nurs'd virtue in it which could thus decide! But empire o'er the intellect of man, Wide-spread, hast thou, O Calvin, since enjoy'd! There was a tribe puissant, of thy doctrines Sprung, that all Europe's politics have since Infected, shaking civil institutions, And making monarchs tremble on their thrones; Vexing old England in a glorious reign Most, and a firm heroic, able Princess, Trying, entangling, damping, and o'erclouding. Incessant were the complots of the cold And subtle poison that they spread, and deep And copious were the seeds of future war Internal, and dissension, spreading hate Thro social ties. The name of Puritan To all is known; yet only to a few The purposes, and means, and tricks, and weapon, And guile, and concert in each seeming act Of pure simplicity! O daring Knox, O Whittingham and Coverdale, who, here Finding asylum from the sanguine sceptre Of bigot Mary, were this master's pupils, Drinking the essences of mind and heart From Calvin as your God, and bore in triumph Those fruits to Albion's and to Scotia's shores. Then through the Court that Tudor's Princess rul'd, Faction among the nobles spread, and Discord Threw out her snakes, that hiss'd and scatter'd venom! Now through the Church th'insinuating drug Bred a false zeal, and war polemic wak'd, That wheresoe'er its head was bruis'd, but rose Twofold, in places new!—Then government Became a dangerous and a weary thing; And Burleigh's brain and heart grew sick, and bent Beneath the feebleness of age, and sunk In sorrow to the grave; and Egerton The Seals of Equity and Conscience held, In vigorous manhood, by the aid of talents Strong, clear, and active, but with difficulty. And now the march of years, and sorrow's draught, Heavily on the bosom hanging, brought The gallant Princess to the grave, and James Ascended in triumphant vanity,— All hope without a cloud—and confident In the full prowess of his learned head, To put down Faction's voice, and spell the pen From the charm'd hand of controversialist! But, ah! how little did he know his force! He was the very instrument for those He was so rife to battle with; and well Were they prepar'd to daunt him to the fight, To draw him to the snare, as does the spider The fly on which she darts! for cobwebs thick, And strong, they spun in every corner, and On every tree! the Monarch struggling seen,— Sport for his courtiers—for the subtler spinners Triumph conceal'd and inexpressible!— Thus pass'd his days, that soon began with clouds And plots to darken that deep loaded sky, Which he had at his entrance fondly thought, Could only sunshine be beneath his wisdom! O Monarch all of petitess supreme, Great in small things, and then whenever greatness Was call'd for, truly least of all the little, Thou didst by each day's folly thick prepare The storms and bloodshed for thy fated son, Who on the scaffold clos'd his wretched days! Now, Puritans, the practical effect Of all the theoretic looms of blood Ye had been working into action, came, And now it was a war of words no longer: Out leap'd the sword; and armies met; and brother Oppos'd himself to brother's instrument Of death! and fields with civil blood were cover'd, And fortunes fell, and gallant heroes died; And law was overturn'd, and blessed Arts Cover'd their heads and hands, and clos'd their voices. And thou, divinest Poesy, e'en thou Fledst the domains, where Heaven had begun To breathe her accents from the lyre, and He, The Bard of Paradise, in Ludlow's Castle, Or Harefield's Halls, had just begun to open Strains of a tone ne'er yet in Albion sounded. Then the all-virtuous, and all-eloquent, All-learned Falkland fell at Newbury, Already sunk in sorrow for the times, And daring death in midst of hostile swords! Then thou from whom the stream of blood I draw, That circuits thro my veins, O beautiful And gallant Mainwaring, didst nobly die On Chester walls, and to an ancient name Didst leave no scion male! and still I hold The Garter, signal of thy loyalty, Cut from the monarch's shoulder, and in need Giv'n to thy widow as a future pledge! But many a battle still was to be fought,— And still, when Newbury's disastrous doom Could not be chang'd, rested the conflict's issue Between a gallant monarch and a people, Who, when awaken'd to the war, would never Leave liberty's broad banner in the dust! Then thou, Newcastle, in thy youth uprear'd To all that wealth, and rank, and courts, and arts, And all that peace, by its most splendid rays Of chivalrous adornment, and the glories Of all the Muses, could create,—didst buckle Thy armour on for rude spear-cover'd camps, And fields of desperate onset; and didst bear The labour and the peril with the roughest! Last came the fated fight of Marston Moor, Where thy bold troops thou to the battle ledst, And gallantly and desperately struggledst! But all was vain; and when the day beheld All lost, and thou wert with most base neglect, Or ignorance, or envy foul, betray'd,— In foreign realms an exile many a year Of pressing dark adversity and straits Of want, and perils, and heart-breaking crosses, Didst thou in patience and with cheerfulness Endure, and saw'dst at last thy Prince restor'd; And still had many a year of peace to come Within thy native land, and midst of rank, Wealth, honours, arts, tranquillity of mind, Beheldst thy sun go down, and sink at last A mild octogenarian to the grave! But, O my flighty Muse, how far hast thou Wander'd from thy elected theme! Resume Thy purpose; backward dart thy wings again; For Muses ever have ubiquity; Perch for a moment on proud Dover's heights, Then from the white cliffs take thine airy way Across old Ocean's mighty billows, dashing Their thundring noises thro the straits, that separate Albion from its defying rival Gaul! Leagues after leagues, (the grand metropolis Of France, the boast of near two thousand years, Escaping on thy right,) to Jura's summits,— Cities and towns and hamlets left unnotic'd, Beyond the counter's skill to numerate, Thou reachest,—and then down again once more Alightest on thy purple Lake, all spangling With young Aurora's beams! and thus once more Within Geneva's beauteous circuit restest! END OF BOOK I. BOOK II. There are who think that under all the forms Of nature's scenery the mind of man Is still the same; that mountain, lake, and hill, And valley, and deep woods, and ocean broad, No more affect it; and give force no more And happiness, than the dull vapoury plain, Ever the same, on which the beams of Heaven Throw no variety of shapes and colours. Not so wise theory, not so experience Instructs us: we are children of the lights Of the blue sky, and as the spirits move, And the veins play, the intellect its hues, And motions takes! Thus poets on thy lake, O Leman, ought to live:—but yet 'tis rare! Rousseau, though not in metre, was a poet In all the essences of his high genius!— Not so precisely eloquent De Stael! Tho sometimes in Corinne the Muse's hand And voice, and imagery, and emotion, Were hers! But round her cradle forms of life, And voices, and o'er-labour'd trains of thought, Too artificial, and the false results Of a luxurious capital, were ever Bending her quick and plastic intellect To wit, miscall'd the proof of force supreme Of the brain's operations, too much stirr'd By the collision of base rivalry;— Where the strife is for conquest,—not for wisdom; And where acuteness more than grandeur marks The struggle and the fruit. On Coppet's banks The Priestess liv'd impatient: her keen eyes Look'd on the tumbling waters, and the giant Heights that across them tower'd into the clouds, Clad with eternal snow; but yet whose tops Morning and evening shone with rosy beams O'th' blessed sun! She look'd; but sigh'd for mirrors Of artificial splendor, and the forms That social fashion ever dresses up In whimsical costume, and not the whispers Or louder noises of the wave-stirr'd breeze; But the pain'd murmurs of the soft coquette, Or studied mimickries of tone pretended Of beau, or statesman, or cramp'd orator, Where knowledge of an accidental state Of manners, and of feelings, and ambition, Was sillily mistaken for sagacity And wisdom.—Nature with her grandest voices And most magnificent shapes, and mightiest airs Of frame-invigorating elements, Was not to Coppet's Baroness so moving, As a saloon of Paris fill'd with wits, Beauties, coquettes, and nobles, and budge authors, Whose passion in the journals of the day To figure, prompted to a restless life, Full of ennui, and labour charlatanic, And feebleness of body, and regrets Of conscience for mis-spent abilities! O strangely various is the human fate, And human occupation! How wast thou Employ'd, O learned Beza, on the banks Of this lov'd lake for a long glorious life Of intellectual energies, of taste, Thought, poetry, and forceful sentiment, And warm, heart-mellowing, and chaste Religion! Far different from thy master, Calvin's, was Thine heart: not dry, and hard, and in scholastic And controversial divinity Pent up, but with the captivating graces Of ornamental letters deep imbued, And joying to the last in the sweet studies Of thy gay days of youthful efflorescence.— Poet, and moralist, as elegant As erudite! when more than eighty years Had shook thy trembling hand, till scarce a stroke Distinctly it could make, thou didst again Freshen with dews these flowers, that in the garden Of thy young fancy were rear'd up to bloom, And flourish, and put forth their shining hues, Spotted with all rich colours, and with scents Vernal delighting. There they stand in pale And venerable spells, in those fond haunts, Where all thy worthies by the painter's skill, Geneva, live—and all the labour'd fruits Of their enlighten'd minds survive to teach Posterity:—and my enthusiast eyes Have dwelt upon them, and my feeble skill Has striven to decypher them, and mark, Compare, and contrast the slow-changing hues From over-flowing youth to waning age! As thou wert champion of the Church Reform'd— So keen were Rome's foul myrmidons against thee; Then with incessant scandal did they stain Thy venerable age, and all the levities Brought of thy boyhood to reproach's aid.— But thou in conscious rectitude revivedst Those early blossoms; and they stand recorded In the best types of thy most learned printers; And now the misty dawn of light begins To break upon me! But not yet the hour Of three has sounded from St. Peter's tower: Yet short the space that after midnight's calm Mantle had veil'd the skies, when all but I Were wrapt in slumbrous rest, the Muse awoke me, And I to my accustom'd toil applied, My promis'd task to execute; and now While I these lines am writing, quick the rays Of sweet Aurora pierce the vapoury gray That hastens off, as if affrighted, swifter Than birds, that in the heavens dart away From their strong-plum'd destroyers! O how intense the brilliance and the beauty Of morning's golden dawn, that over Alpine Summits I daily see arise, since thirteen Months have near pass'd, and not e'en once have I Fail'd from my bed to gaze upon the picture! But thus our faculties their vigour gain, And I my daily, nightly, efforts ply T'approach to spirit! Thought, and words, and images Thus multiply, and more distinctly come! And on the verge of that extent of life, Which is man's common lot, and after sickness Of more than four much-troubled years, my brain, If I do not delude myself, has grown To strength and copiousness, before it knew not. But 'tis perchance the cheer!—The cheer has come At last, whose want I languish'd for, and now Its motions are all energy and hope! For nature made me timid: and timidity Sits like a vampire over the mind's efforts. Coppet, when the Genevan Banker, risen From counting his dry figures, to the state Of Minister of mighty France, in times Which all a politician's wisest powers And most consummate arts call'd into play,— Possess'd thee,—little were thy master's habits, And trains of mind congenial to the fierce And chivalrous ambitions, that in days Of feudal splendor did for many ages Rule thee, as thy proud lords! O gallant Grandson, Burgundian chief, whose name is yet familiar Throughout old Jura's heights, and echoes yet Along Helvetian mountains, whose mail'd warrior Amid the Gothic wonders of Lausanne's Rich shrines in proud recumbent figure lies Sculptur'd in stone, full many a tale have I To tell of you; but the capricious Muse Must wait her time.—Wide and remote the current Of thy impetuous blood impelled thee on To distant regions, and among the Barons Of haughty England was thy stock establish'd; And from thy veins the proud ambitious Beauforts Sprung, and the saintly Margaret, the mother Of the seventh Harry, monarch of the Isles Whose swords, wealth, gallanties, and genius strong, Have ever held their sway puissant over The destinies of Europe:—monarch, sage and wily, And prudent, and to whom, albeit stern And avaricious, England much of vigour, And much advance in commerce and the arts Owes,—of the Tudor dynasty the chief— A dynasty whose reign was short, but mighty, And glorious—e'en though thou capricious king,— A tyrant in tyrannic times; a lover Of numerous wives, whom soon as sated with, Of blood regardless, thou didst to the scaffold With hatred merciless and savage humour Consign—e'en thou, detested despot, were Chief of the Line!—For from thee came a princess Splendid, as most that on the' historic page Have their reigns blazon'd! Yes, from Coppet's lords Part of thy blood came in a gallant stream! O alter'd times! O good and evil mix'd, That changes have effected! O how different Was the wild splendor of thy board, De Stael, When in October's moody evenings, as The sobbing breeze drove the leaves on the Lake, And stripp'd the groves of their umbrageous honours, The gorgeous blaze of lamps the guests attracted, Of wit and genius, to thy table, spread With modern luxuries! Then converse bright Eclips'd the show of the Financier's wealth.— And here again to thy fond name, O Byron, I must return! I see thee listening now To the conflict where at every dart flash forth Splendors thou canst not reach; and then half angry, Or envious, half delighted, thou dost shrink Moody into thyself, and as the blast By fits comes shrieking, or in deep hoarse roar Over the beating waters, of thy boat Think'st, and half risest to enjoy the battle Of more congenial elements without;— But then again to thy luxurious seat Thyself thou reconcilest, and wouldst yet Hope not eclips'd and vanquish'd to depart! O pride intolerable, yet with flashes Of generous submission and humility, And admiration of corrival powers, When not insulted, and the victory Borne with meek placidness, devoid of vain Arrogant triumph. But thy mind remains E'en now but half develop'd, firey Bard! Perchance a poet only well can write A poet's life, and such the fate which thee, O Bard of Newsted, has awaited: Moore, England's Anacreon, has fulfill'd the task; But now and then it may be thought the strain Was not congenial;—the profundity Of the great poet's gloom was of the heart; His frolic levities were but assum'd! And sometines his companions seem'd th'effect Of chance more than of choice. Thus he who perish'd Upon the shores of Lirici so fatally, Whelm'd in the waves of the tempesturous Ocean— Himself also a bard,—but yet a bard Of mingled stars and clouds!—he touch'd the lyre Sometimes in happier hour with a light hand, That drew forth tones most exquisitely sweet; But then again he labour'd in confusion Dark, enigmatic, falsely gorgeous, struggling To grasp at monstrous unmatur'd conceptions, Unmanag'd, and unmanagable, mystic, Dangerous, sceptical, and fanciful. Beneath the roof that Diodati's name Has consecrated to the Muses, he, The victim of the stormy billows, pass'd The autumn, to the noble poet big With such heart-swelling sorrows!—He whose tales Of Monks profane, and of hobhoblins dire, Won a false sensual taste, and a foul fame Of spurious wit,—a guest was also there; And she the genius deep of Frankenstein, And others known perchance, or thirstily Aspiring to be known,—a motley crew;— Not one congenial with his noble host! Above thy banks, O Leman, to a point Where thy waves gather, at its western bound, And, issuing in a purple torrent, force Their passage thro the strait, on whose steep banks Stands thy fam'd city once the capital Of the Burgundian realm—now numerous On thy o'ershadowing heights the fair campaignes Glitter. Here d'Aubigné the fair abode Of his last days, the wreck of a long life Of busy conflicts and adventures bold, Fix'd;—while his plume as ready as his sword Told the long tale of many a feat of gallantry, And many a court intrigue, and many a danger, In the fierce wars of bigot zeal, which stain'd The bloody struggles for a pure religion. O Bourbon, in whose generous character, The wit, the hero, the sagacious wordling, The chivalrous adventurer, the lover, The friend, th'abandon'd to luxurious pleasure, A many-colour'd web of brilliant hues Is woven, and whose threads of gloomier tint Were cut at last too short by the dire dagger Of an insane assassin, well has d'Aubigné Recorded the memorials, that still prove The truth of thy well-merited renown! Here in his old age were the nuptials gaily A second time perform'd, and proud Geneva Received him to the bosom of a House, It cherished much—from Lucca's warmer skies Transplanted,—Burlamachi's race, long flourishing— Extinct at last. But from his veins descended Of his first issue one, who to the heir Of his great kingly friend, and to the court Of brilliant and ambitious France, nor less To Europe's wide-spread nations, was a star Of female brilliance, that eclips'd the lights Of other deep intriguers! Maintenon, Who does not know thy name; while yet thy character Remains an half enigma, which Saint-Simon's Piercing, acute, sincere, but somewhat tedious Pen, has not yet entirely clear'd from doubt? Here Rohan's Duke, who fought so long with bravery The Protestant cause against the force of France, The remnant of his days, to seek for calm, And nature's tranquil but majestic scenes, Appointed, and in thy cathedral walls His relics, and the funeral memorial, Defil'd in latter years by hands profane Of revolutionary rabbles, still Beneath thy Gothic roofs, displays its broken Sculpture: but better were the history Of his field-active days, for prose than verse; And well has he himself the story given. Here Bonnet on low Genthod's jutting point In philosophic studies, natural science, And expositions of the Power Divine, His long life of incessant study pass'd. If reader thou art curious, thou mayst read In the rich pages of historic Müller The record of his calm yet busy days, And virtuous simple life. Here Mallet vers'd In antiquarian lore, and philosophic Annals of Europe's politics, his labours Oft gather'd from the sources far remote Of other realms, beneath more northern skies Sometimes applied; tho from his native soil Distant, too much of his researchful life Was spent: but not on frozen themes, or rude; For curious are the sources he evolv'd Of the bold Runic Muse; and much our Gray, And much our Percy, of old poetry, The elegant and learned chronicler, Drew cups of inspiration from the fount! But richly-stor'd, and eloquently-gifted, Sismondi has a brief memorial given Of the learn'd annalist; and now his fame Rests undisturb'd. Here Stanhope from the councils Of Albion's ermin'd robes retir'd to nurse His scientific passions: here Mahon In his sire's dry philosophy imbued, Yet with the passion of an ardent mind, Drank in republican notions from his cradle, And in his manhood to his native land Returning, spent a life of usefulness In his laborious youth's profound pursuits Of science practical, and in the plain Habits by puritanic Calvin nurs'd. But he was wise and virtuous,—and, exempt From pride aristocratic, wide secur'd Love and respect, though sometimes intermingled With scorn dealt out by brother-peers, who thought Their ermine soil'd by puritanic manners. So Pitt, his near alliance, though himself Of manners plain and simple, and absorb'd In intellect, yet deem'd: nor would allow The politics of a minute republic Well suited to a mighty kingdom's state: And surely wise and undeniable Was the great Minister's judgment: for the rule Of human beings lies upon the heart; And not in dry deductions from the mechanism Of reason plied to abstract sciences:— And the mere reasoner is a man who sees A distance short—nay shortest, while the lamp Of bright imagination, that has insight Of the dark passions working in man's bosom, And has sagacity and judicious choice, Alone can lay profound designs, adapted For government of man's mysterious character. Thus Burke,—of politicians of his age The nearest inspiration,—thought: and thus Immortal Bacon, the bright luminary Of science!—Thus endow'd have ever been The mighty statesmen of the world: thus Buckhurst, Clarendon, Somers, St. John, Pulteney, Carteret, And Chatham, high and bright above the highest. Thus Canning, latest dead, and most deplor'd In days of utmost need;—since which the glory Of Britain's radiant countenance has paled Her beams in darkness to the rival eye Of Europe,—envious then,—triumphant now, And most insulting! But a little while, And proudly shall she raise her head again, And bid defiance to her enemies! But I am once more wandring,—ever flying Back to those native soils, which scarcely man Could ever from his bosom's depths eradicate; However like a stepmother she acted! Geneva, cherish'd, lov'd, admir'd Geneva, I will resume thy tales gain, and bring Thy worthies back to view! Here the learn'd stock Of Stephens half a century pursued Their most enlightened toils, and hence sent forth The stores of ancient literature, to teach Reviving taste, and those enlighten'd strains, Whether in verse or prose, which Greece and Rome Had once instructed, and adorn'd the world with; And which for long long centuries inhum'd In monkish cells unnotic'd, now came forth By late-discover'd printing's aid, (decipher'd By erudition never rival'd since,) To the film-clear'd, and sharp enraptured eye Of Learning's sons, in types correctly plac'd, Text clear, and notes and comments, keen, profound, The fruits of talent, sedulously bent, And ardent deep research, incessantly Pursued, and never weary.—Son to son The erudite and happy zeal descended, In generations more than I can count: But in thy pages, classical Maittaire, The story may be found; and he who reads And feels no interest, is but a clown With a clod heart and head of barren wood. Here Henry thou, of this Stephensian race The third,—but not the last,—didst carry on Thy erudite and most wreath-worthy works In moody humour, thou thyself a wit Of most capricious hues, sometimes in joy, But oftner in dark clouds and heart-consuming Adversity: and sometimes with thy brain Disorder'd by the troubles, and the restless Emotions of thine ever-busy spirit! Then Casaubon, perchance by thine alliance Prompted, his days of unrelenting study Gave to pursuits congenial; and his name, And the ripe fruits of his assiduous culture, Live as of yesterday. Again my theme Leads me to native regions: England's Monarch Attracted by his learned reputation, Hence drew him, in the splendor of the throne Of Britain, recompence and patronage To seek; and thus the son, part-heritor Of his paternal arts, was plac'd a canon In Dorovernium's magnificent Structure, where Becket's archiepiscopal Blood purples yet the church's sacred stone, And, neighbouring Ickham, thou, whence last my sickly Frame I transported hither, didst receive The learned critic for thy church's pastor! Hence, Stanley, thou of Greek celebrity, Perchance thine Æschylusian notes and comments In part mightst draw, for Casaubon in ties Of social vicinage might oft enjoy Thy conversation, where in bonds of union The travel'd and poetic Sandys, and Digges, Of fame historic in the civil broils Of those unhappy days, and many a name, In registers of learning yet preserv'd, Liv'd in alliance and kind neighbourhood: And thy descendants, Meric, yet remain In Durovernium's walls, and in its province! Thus ever have thy sympathies and ties Of blood and friendship, O Geneva, been With England's children! Nor is Ickham's hamlet, Its ivied towers, and its rude antique rectory, And thy rich pastures, Lee, now first connected With the broad Lake, where mountainous Mont-Blanc Daily in majesty among the clouds Smiles, or frowns over the assembled torrents By Alpine fountains fed, and sends its waters By the circuitous Arve's impetuous channels To join the Rhone, that through the narrow gorge Of Alps and Jura met, in purple stain'd, Bursts with a fearful roar!—Yet distant countries Not then, as now, communication held By beaten tracks, and all the luxuries Of easy transit, while the missive charge Of the pen's register'd mirror of the mind Was slow and interrupted. Nations now Mingle almost as brothers of the same Stock, education, habits, morals, feelings! Voltaire! I hear thy spirit vain reproach me, That I so long have thy proud name delay'd! Close to my window lies thine ancient haunt O'erlooking the blue waters, and the towers And cluster'd roofs of old Geneva's town, Once princely and imperial, now to other Glory political aspiring!—Here By appellation known, that well befits The purposes it sought, (for les Delices 'Twas call'd, and still is call'd,) the accomplish'd Bard His captivating lures to the sour temper Of puritanic strictness dar'd display. Here the world by the drama's mirror he And all th' attractions of Parisian gaiety Shew'd! till th'insulted government assuming Its proper force, to Ferney's French domains Expell'd him! 'Tis a perilous adventure To draw the portrait of a genius, whom The world has for a century endeavour'd With all the force of critical acumen To paint in his true colours; who e'en now In popularity thro all the letter'd Society of nations still augments! For me against a sense so universal To lift my voice seems madness.—I have task'd My taste and judgment o'er and o'er again;— And yet I think the same!—I am not able This charm to pierce: in it there is to me But little merit, and still less attraction. It is a clear transparent stream of elegance, With a light bottom. Never does it rise To eloquence, or energy!—It has The art of throwing all vain accessaries Away, and seeming to extract the essence Of every subject:—it is in sooth a trick, If I may so express myself, of saying Trite things, adapted to the apprehension Of common minds, as if they were discoveries Of deep and philosophic genius; and A shrewd appeal to what the populace Calls common sense;—forever mingled with That jest and ridicule and irony And taunt, which are the unresisted masters Of vulgar intellects. But for the heart,— The generous feeling,—the emotion grand,— Nerer by chance is there a single spark! His proper motto is—“The world's a jest, “And all things shew it!”—But the world is not A jest! and therefore he's no sage or bard! Yet even in the apprehensions of The people will a witticism be The most consummate and resistless argument; And he who laughs;—and has th' ungenerous talent To see th' absurd, or make it, holds a rod, A spear—whose touch is instant victory. But I would never trust the bosom, which First sees th'incongruent in presented objects, Material or ideal!—It betrays A littleness of mind; a microscopic Habit of searching with ungenerous labour, Not for the good, but bad:—for combinations Invented ill; for failures, which may prove Man's being, and the Universe, a folly!— It soothes frail human envy to believe There is no greatness;—that pretended wisdom, Virtue, and magnanimity, cannot The sharp dissecting eye of wit withstand; And that the greatest sage is he, whose insight Can shew them all to be unsound delusions. Thou wast, Voltaire, as I conceive, in midst Of all thy worldly elevation, ill At ease in thine own heart;—thy spirit working To carry thine own points by artifice, Mistrustful of intrinsic strength or greatness; Thinking that genius was, in truth, a farce; And in thine own art drowning all thy comfort; Seeking the plausible, and not the true;— Witty, not wise; and deeming grandeur, beauty, To lie i' the pictur'd image only;—not In the reality! the passions ever At work to crush thy rivals by deep artifice And living only in the vain applause Of loud capricious multitudes! In thee There was no genuine love of nature's charms; Of beauty no idolatry;—no fictions Of fairy lands; no heavenly visitings Involuntary of imagination. But ever the long studied combination Of forc'd, not forceful, art!—Then daily watchfulness Of rival power no peace within the bosom Left, and the rising genius of Rousseau Was poison thus to thy frail veteran breast. And thus in secret were the enmities Of the all-morbid dreamer's fellow-citizens Nurs'd, and incessant by the insidious darts Of wit perverted the sad wanderer's step Prevented from return to the dear spot Of his inspir'd nativity! But ye, Who in these two dispute the palm of genius, First fix precisely that which constitutes True genius! If, as said, it be th'invention Of what is grand, or beautiful, or tender, And simpathises with the native movements That Heaven into the human breast instils, Then who will most abide this test? the rhymer In verse prosaic of dull Ferney's lord, Or he, the eloquent and passionate Dreamer of Heloise's melting bosom, The painter of the storm on Leman's Lake, The muse-enchanted wood-crownd rocks that hang Over the bright waves at La Meilleirai: If it were true, that Ferney's Lord has drawn Man as he is with more fidelity, 'Tis man alone in his material essence, Mingled with earth's contaminating grossness. Genius is better conversant with man's Feelings and thoughts than with his coarsest actions. O call not this delusion! Virtue lives More in the mind and heart than in the body, And all of grandeur we enjoy, and beauty, And love, and admiration, not the less Is genuine, if it only be ideal!— Without th'associations, which the mind To matter brings, it is a barren essence. It may be said that Ferney's Bard is ever All intellect:—but then it is an intellect Applied to Man in his most artificial Condition in society; with manners, Passions, ambitions, toils, pursuits of pleasure, Of judgment rules, and estimates of merit, Conventional,—far more the close result Of nice observance, than of pure invention: Not the embodiment of abstract thoughts In living imagery, but itself abstraction, Subtle, unsimpathising with the heart, Calling forth only the keen faculties Of apprehension, judgment, memory!— These are miscall'd delusions, which removed, Then all the charms of life dissolve away! It is not reason, which the callous give That sacred name! They stupidly call reason That which their hands can touch, and eyes can see, And ears can hear; and they are sceptical On all which is unseen, unheard, unknown, Save in the regions of imagination! So, when the heart at the sublime and fair In Man's conceptions to high rapture swells, They call it an irrational delusion! Thus reason is the damper and extinguisher, Which not produces fruit, but only blights it. Far up among the mountain gorges lies The rude domain of craggy Faucigny. Its ancient feudal lords were sovereign princes; And high were their alliances, and rivals Of the Genevan Counts, and those of Savoy! Oft on the summits of its crags are perch'd The fragments of their castellated towers Among the clouds in most magnificent form; And in its narrow vallies green is view'd The loveliness of nature in her softest And sweetest hues and features. There, St.-Gervais, I pass'd an autumn month in thy abode, Since which twelve busy years have pass'd away, Bringing in their career full many a change To Europe, and to half the world besides! Imagination cannot figure scenes More beautiful, more grand, of rural shapes And hues more full of ravishment, Than thine, St.-Gervais, in an autumn day Of splendor; nor a peasantry in childhood Of face more lovely, and seemingly more happy! Beneath th'incessant sound of the cascade, In foamy torrents of white spray descending From its precipitous heights, was plac'd th'abode, For congregated crews of strangers built, Who come the medical powers to seek of waters Sulphureous, bursting from its iron rocks! It is a strange concurrence, from all nations Deep in this mountainous solitude to meet The creatures of the busy social world, Soldiers, and politicians, lawyers, authors, Churchmen, and men of commerce, fluttering insects Of buzzing fashion;—most in morning rambles Seeking by air and exercise, and impulse Of viewing nature's wonders to beguile The loneliness and savage imagery, Which overcomes the feebleness of spirits Of artificial creatures bred in cities; A vain enervating and languid course Of days to seek a false enjoyment in! Roving along the river's banks, or clambering The rocky summits by the brushwood twigs, Or by the circling or meandring paths Cut thro dwarf woods, hard labouring up the steeps To hamlets perch'd like eagle eyries high Among the snowy clouds, where yet the haunts Of mountain-peasantry at crowded marts Are found with human commerce babbling loud, And striking by the sight of wild costume, Of Alpine loneliness, where half the winter In snow immur'd they sleep their hours away! Yet here the busy passions, here the cunning Of bargain-makers, the pert vanity Of ogle-eyed coquets, in restless search Of admiration, the devices subtle Of craving avarice, and the dull obstinacy Of boors, from ignorant demand ne'er driven! But, O how active in these mighty frolics Of nature is imagination's power! Here where the ruin'd turret, hanging still On heights of seeming inaccessibility, Impels the mind to work upon the hardihood Of feudal gallantry, yet richly dight With chivalrous adornments of grand feasts, The music and the dance, and beauty's eyes Reigning their influence,”—the heart-rousing tale Of damsels in distress, by giants held Imprison'd, and by fell enchanter's wands Kept in delusion's sense-distracting wiles, In danger to the pure fidelity, Sworn to some favour'd lover,—with a store Of fictions raising up the hair on end,— Visit thy poet's dreams, and daily musings:— And here with half-shut eyes he sits, absorb'd In visions, while the torrents roar, and sparkles Of upthrown spray awake him now and then; And from his seat he starts, and recollects He yet is mingled with the damping intercourse Of daily life, and groveling characters, Who lick the dust alone, and crawl the earth; And soon the bell will sound to summon him To crowded table of world-judging strangers. Beneath the scorching sun too oft I rambled Over thy burning rocks; when fierce disease Rag'd in my veins, and made my painful footsteps Trembling and insecure; and thus when winter Came sharp at Florence over Arno's waves, Curdled my blood again, and I once more On the sad couch of sickness doom'd to linger, Pass'd many a month, while o'er me death his dart Held. Still I strove the mental flame to nurse, And with the visions of the moral fable, And curious rolls of antiquarian lore, Alternately my agonies I sooth'd: Nor yet are all the fruits of those fair studies Utterly faded and forgotten. Willoughby, Thy fiction, seemingly historic, draws Sometimes the thoughtful reader's eye, where shines Raleigh's adventrous spirit, mingled with Thy softer sufferings, sweet Arabella, Punish'd for too much royalty of blood! And thus the genealogic lore work'd out From many a dry and uninviting source, Stands in fair types of thy illustrious city, O Florence, ancient seat of mighty genius, Of splendid arts and learning from the dust Of black oblivion to full life recall'd! Sometimes 'tis good that we should quit the world, And in earth's most magnificent solitudes New-plume our wings for contemplation. But th'intermixture of the odious puppets Of that world's most delusive stage, our steps Following, defeats the working of the spell. Strange mixtures in my mind did that month's residence Produce;—and not less strange, perchance, upon The morbid current of my heated veins, By force of the sulphureous waters, that The vapoury rocks threw forth. There, Coningsby, I clos'd thy tragic Tale: a tale neglected By the hard-hearted reading multitude; Yet, confident am I, not undeserving Of sensibility's abundant tears. These Baths did for a time appease the tumults Raging within my being's purple streams: But much I doubt, if they did not repell, Rather than cure. For never from that year Has my blood rightly flow'd. And then the troubles Of mind and heart, without the added pangs Of a disorder'd body, were sufficient To overwhelm gigantic strength of spirit! But Italy, O Italy, in charms Of Nature most profuse, would I could live With thee! The Alpine passage to thy realms Gave me new life by its stupendous grandeur. And thou, O Florence, smiling then in warmth, Like spring, though dark November's clouds in other Climes were collecting o'er the misty sky! But Winter came at last,—and with a vengeance, As sharp as in the dreaded North! And now I sunk once more, and bow'd to kiss the feet Of Death. In that forever-fam'd abode, My hours were doom'd to the sick chamber's bounds, And where adored poetry, and rich painting, And magic sculpture, reign'd o'er every scene, And shone on every wall; where history, And all the mellowest eloquence of learning, Haunted all sites; and Medicean splendor Was intertwined with every hallow'd object, All was a blank to me! For in the tortures Of my convulsed frame, and use of limbs Lost, my position was scarce more auspicious, Than in some dull unconsecrated haunt. Then once more with the spring the fever'd blood Seem'd it's sad venomous bitterness to calm, And now where Virgil's holy relics lie, And o'er the Neapolitan Bay the summit Of proud Vesuvius vomits fluid flames, My destiny convey'd me. Pisa fam'd In all Italian annals, and of late To Britons dear for its most noble poet's Abode, in the hurried tempest-shaken days Preceding his heroic Grecian death, I pass'd, and at Livornia's busy port First cast my eyes on Mediterranean waves. Thence round Italia's shores, and sea-gem'd isles, Elba, and Sarde, and many a name in story Familiar, for eleven long sunburnt days, We voyag'd—not without full many a peril Of tempest and of pirates; and with joy Laugh'd, and were near convuls'd, when that bright Bay Of glorious beauty and sublimity Mix'd, to whose shores our frail and crowded bark Was destin'd, open'd on our dazzled view. 'Twas noon, the end of May:—the radiant sun Was on the bosom of the mighty waters, And on the tops of the unnumbered promontories, Towns, hamlets, castles, villas; and St.-Elmo Shew'd her magnificent summit. To the harbour, Crowded with ships of many a distant nation, Our prow in joy exulting cut its way. The solar beams now with a flame intolerable Shot right upon our heads: and still we had T'endure the torments long of quarantine, Mid crowded vessels, filth, and stench, and noise, Lock'd closely side to side,—the suffering Was scarce endurable;—and then, to crown it, My passport was irregular,—and I Was threaten'd with a prison, and had nearly Incurr'd that order of a despot power. Now in that beautiful and unrival'd city Hotels were crowded, and around the beds, And on the floors where we repos'd, were seen Scorpions disporting in dire multitudes. But soon, Chiaia, thy enchanting spot Receiv'd us, with Vesuvius on our left, The Bay before us—and upon the rock Of laurel to the right where Sannazaro Dwelt, the still worship'd tomb where Virgil sleeps! There six sweet months of nature's highest brilliance We whil'd away, though Carbonari troubles For a short moment clouded our fair joys With fear and peril, and at last the storm Blackening, and seemingly about to burst, Drove us away to Rome. It was an earthly Paradise, inasmuch as nature's charms Could make it one—and ill departed from! For Rome—the heavy air to me o'ercame All its attractions. Not a day of health There could I find, and gladly did I seek, After four months another change of climate. Then thee, Ferrara, fam'd for Estè's house, And Tasso's amorous madness, and ye hills Of Euganean lustre, that the beams Of eve on Petrarch's holy age reflected; And Padua, thee; and most of all immortal Gem of the Adriatic, wave-clad Venice! And then a roll of names which but to mention Awakens all the treasures of the mind Verona, Bergamo, Vicenza, Milan, Turin and Chambery, and steep Mont Cenis. And then again we to thy Lake return'd, O subject of my song, and where an empress Had late resided, took up our abode. Intensely here my literary labours I plied, and clos'd the haunted Tale of Huntley And Alice Berkeley, and Sir Ambrose Grey, And shriek-filld Hellingsley's spoil-coverd hall: And here the Tale of Odo's Count went on, Where innocent and most angelic Bertha Bore on the scaffold an heroic death. And now upon the dry and most perplex'd Question of Wealth of nations, and the means Of wise and economic circulation, I meditated deeply, and thus clear'd To my own mind's conviction the enigma. And then the Bibliomania, which had long Infected my researches, came again To occupy too many of my hours. And all the while the torments of affairs Of wretched business, and the wiles of cunning Extortion, wickedness, ingratitude, Audacious insult, inconceivable Perversion of the laws, meant for protection, To instruments of wrong and ravenous rapine! And during all, a heart by nature timid, Morbid, and rous'd with dangerous emotion At slightest cause for care, grief, or regret: And when they touch'd, losing the happy train Of those ideas to the Muses suited. But ever in my utmost agonies I struggled still the trembling pen to guide, And call'd the frighten'd Muse to calm my breast. Yet what will not malignity pervert? This energy of stout resistance, which May fairly arrogate the name of virtue, Has oft-times by the cruelty of censure Been deem'd a reckless disregard of duties! As if the virtue were in brooding over Evils we cannot change! as if to smile, And live in regions of imagination, When coarse reality is unendurable Misery, were a crime to be reproach'd! “But when” it may be said, “your enchanted ears “Are listening to Elysian waterfalls, “You will not hearken to the trumpet's call, “When summon'd back to duty!” It may be, The Muse's votary is sometimes lost In this delirium: will he be the less In the wild depths of unresisted grief? But now incessant were th'insulting calls On my most outrag'd spirit! Morns and nights Scarcely suffic'd for the exhausting tasks, Necessity and just defence impos'd On my worn pen. But my afflicted heart, Ah, far more than my pen, was work'd and worn. It was an iron winter, most severe In its extremities of snow and storm. Right up against the roaring Lake the windows Of my abode, now far within the city, Lay. One dark morning in December's depth, As by the blazing fire on that romance Most magical above all others of The great Magician of the North, the Pirate, My eyes, imagination, heart, intent I sat, a shriek came down the Lake, the House Trembled and rock'd, and twice from my shook chair Was I near tumbled on the floor: the bells Through all the house rang, and St. Peter's sounded, And all the church bells thro the town were shaken, And also gave the signal. 'Twas an earthquake!— Slight—but appalling! Ah! how often since Have I on the portentous moment dwelt! In the same room, and by the self-same fire, After an interval of an hundred months, When I had dwelt in many a far abode, And once for eight and twenty months again My native soil inhabited, some sudden Convulsion struck upon my vital strings; March 1830: see the note at the end of the Poem on Modern Aristocracy. Geneva, 1831. And eight and forty hours I gasp'd for breath. Then came the sleepless bed again; the appetite Gone; and the loss of limbs; and eighteen nights Of dangerous agony, and strange excitement Of intellect, beyond its natural power; Bursts of wild brilliance hitherto unknown To my weak faculties; unintermitted Toil of the intellect e'en for nineteen Successive hours; and still the body torn; Limbs paralis'd, and all the mortal part Of earthly mould, sick even to death's door! Thus it appears, as if the soul can work, In bold defiance of the body's will:— And sometimes blazes most, when it is nearest To its departure. Much I've travel'd since In mind and heart; and in my own conceit Have far advanc'd. I cannot count the pages Of various matter I have written and printed Since that most perilous crisis,—poetry, And prose-romance, and politics, and memoirs; And dry antiquities, and moral essays, On which my busy pen is ever running. “Accursed scribbler!” cries the wretch, whose false Concoctions, like th'enchanter's forceful spear, My plume goes forth to pierce, and open lay His snares of dread destruction to the sun! “Scribendi cacoethes! odious passion! “Be fire to its relentless energies, “And light upon it quickly, and consume it!” Not yet thou grand destroyer! O not yet Will be thy wish accomplish'd! I have slept At times, 'tis true, amid 'this morning's task, As if my strength was failing, and that weakness And age, not fire and violence, would consume me! There are, on whose enormous wickedness When I am call'd to meditate, the' emotion Exhausts my spirits more than other labour By day and night continued! My torn nerves Long tremble and distort, ere they subside Again, the calm idea to permit! I am the being but of impulses, And when my heart cannot direct, and light, My head is barren, and my hand is weak. I have no abstract intellect, and cannot Act by what cold dry reason calls a duty;— The worse for me! for I am told 'tis this Which only virtue constitutes! and feeling And grand emotion, though 'tis on the side Of virtuous sympathies, and love of beauty, And admiration of heroic conduct, Is but an impulse of involuntary Unconscience-sprung, and therefore valueless, passion! As for myself, I cannot comment thus In my severest and most self-condemning Moments! For impulses, if they are good, Must spring from virtue's fountains: a bad heart Can never pour forth pure and blessed waters! It may produce them mingled: but the taste, The scent, the penetrating eye, th'effect, After a moment's pause upon the bosom, Will the infusion of the ill discover:— The false bursts, murmurs, flashes, sparkles, dies! If such are these effusions, if the vapour Of false emotion swells them, if the thoughts Come not direct and unsophisticate From the undrug'd and uninfected bosom, If the heart's fiat be not on their utterance, Then sweep them to the pit where they may perish, And never bubble, murmur, sparkle more! And may I be obedient to the doom That I shall then deserve, and hide my head In just obscurity, and linger out The little remnant of my days in silence, And sink into the grave, unwept, unknown! END OF BOOK II. BOOK III. Over thine Eastern head, O Lake, how grand Lausanne her ancient holy spires erects! I need not trace her history: but Britons Ever associate it with Gibbon's name! —A name now universal!—I can trace it With selfish fondness from its private source On the white cliffs, where Dover's frowning towers O'erlook the ocean of the straits, that separate us From rival Gaul. There, having climb'd the heights, That from the town wash'd by the waves ascend, With panting labour;—leaving on our right The tower, the draw-bridge, and gigantic walls Of the stupendous Castle, ever noted In all the pages of old England's annals, On a light chalky soil we journey northward, A little inward from the fearful edge Of those tremendous cliffs, which Shakespeare's pen Forever has immortalised;—a scatter'd Hamlet and humble church,—where from the rim That overlooks the dashing billows, slopes, From the cliff westerly, the sheepwalk,—stands: And close adjoining the obscure remains Of the old manor-house. How little now Are these to outward sight! But the creative Mind beholds in them a most noble spot; The source, the cradle of a mighty genius; Nor will it doubt, that when the rural lords Were wandering o'er these ocean-misted fields, In days of the Tudorian Princess, or Under the feeble but tyrannic rod Of Scotish Stuart's race, to vulgar eyes Only like rival squires of plough-tail memory, That in their brains the fruitful seeds were working Of future European eminence! How have I trac'd them in the parish records With a fond microscopic industry, Which fools and half-philosophers call dull! There the great grandsire of the younger stock Whence sprung th' Historian, planted his young offset From an old root, as antiquaries tell us, Of credit in cotemporary days, (For thus, old Philipot, hast thou recorded!)— It was a fief bought from th'impoverish'd fortune Of a most gallant Peer, whom wise Elizabeth Plac'd on green Erin's barbarous habitants To rule rebellion by a fearless sword! The tasteless recklessness of times gone by May unacquainted be with Borough's name! But 'twas of primal ancientry, and sprung From Cantium's Earl in the heroic times Of the first royalty of proud Plantagenet: And in its source e'en higher than that name Of glorious feudal splendor! For the searcher Of genealogical sagacity Will trace it as a lineal male descendant Of the first race of Merovingian kings! And hence Jerusalem in the first Crusades Drew its third Monarch.—O thou beautiful, Illumin'd Spirit—who with piercing eyes And rapturous gaze the misty veil withdrawest, With which Time covers Truth! is it then possible That thou the stigma shouldst incur of dryness,— Of barren curiosity—of trifling Research and labour? O most odious envy! O most mean, vulgar, ignorant conceit! O most accurs'd mistaker of dull darkness For light! Thou hast no pleasure but to blast The seeds of glory, and nip in the bud The blossoms and the fruit of all that's grand! So thus with thee, old Lord of these high lands, Wash'd by the Ocean's spray! thy sword was all, Or nearly all th'inheritance thou hadst In worldly goods; and therefore was the glory Of thy most princely origin forgotten! And now Necessity, that ever gripes Magnanimous merit, forc'd from thy possession This humble but belov'd manorial heritage; And the small purchase fell to Gibbon's lot! Now two and forty years have pass'd away, Since with fond eye I visited the relics Of this decaying mansion, and its church, A structure mean, neglected, unadorn'd, On whose cold pavement were the stones inscribed With a few names and dates;—all that remain'd Within these sacred walls of the memorials Of a once-numerous race. And then again Thro the old manor-house with searching eye, And heart that almost beat with curiosity, I forward forc'd my steps: the little hall, Earth-floor'd, was now a filthy magazine For wood and lumber: here and there initials And dates remain'd in carve-work: and my eye Glow'd, when the heraldric ensigns round the cornice Of one apartment, blazon'd in their colours, Still shone—a lion and three scallop-shells. A coat not unbecoming nobler stocks! And underneath the date—One thousand and Six hundred twenty seven!—'Twas the grandfather Of him, whose son, a too well known Director Of the mad South-sea Bubble, made his fortune, Lost it again by punishment deserv'd, And then again remade it. But the old man, His father, from a younger brother's share,— One of a numerous bed—had carv'd himself A plentiful endowment in the City, Whither the younger shoots of gentilitial Trees were accustom'd to resort for nutriment,— Matthew, his name baptismal: still it stands Recorded in the old parochial Register. The date—let sceptics note it well, and search— Was, sixteen hundred forty two—precise. The Historian, of his son, the bubble-monger, A brief but spirited portraiture has given. A year or two before the Historian's birth He died, respected, rich, and of a fame For talents, and intelligence political, As well as mercantile. His long removal From native soils had drop'd his Kentish ties, And little to his children and his grandson He left of the remembrance. But the Muse Must wander back again to more remote æras, when in a narrower sphere the race Busied themselves. When Puritanic rage Troubled the land with civil broils, they took, If I have not mis-spelt, the people's part. And yet I a tradition have, obscure And half-forgotten, of the contrary: Rich they then were assuredly, and bought Many fair lands: and sons and daughters flourish'd Spous'd to the worthiest of the neighbouring houses. There Digges, and Cowper, lyric Sandys, and Hammond, And Marsham, and Anacreon Stanley, and Wyatt, Fair Aucher of remote antiquity, And St.-Leger of Norman lustre,—Finet And Mennis, courtly wits—and learned Boys, And travel'd Bargrave, scientific Rooke, And Harflete, and the truly eminent Twysdens, Judge and Historian, and the accomplish'd Dering, Though by wise Clarendon too well remember'd For an unlucky vanity. Enough Perchance of barren catalogue I've given: But who will wonder if here wit and learning Shone in a province, where for centuries Sackville and Sydney, names for ever dear, Presided. Mute, and with shorn beams, and lost, Are now those growing lamps! and a dull cloud Of heavy and impenetrable vapour Sits o'er the province! Not a name but thine, O Tenterden; and thine, accomplish'd Prelate Of Peterborough's mitre, now adorns it! Then, Gibbon, was thy wife by close alliance From the same mother sprung with her, the wife Of one who, fam'd in law and politics From the first Charles's reign to despot-driving William, was ever on the side of freedom! Maynard, to whom the patriot monarch gave The seals of equity in his old age!— And thus the city draper, in alliance Nephew to him who held the royal seals, Kept his head high among the sons of commerce. Meantime Westcliffe's old Hall receiv'd at intervals The congregated branches: to the cliffs They wander'd, and in half-regretful memory Heard the waves beat beneath them, and beheld The white cliffs and the glittering towers of Calais Across the tumbling tides in beautiful And heart-arousing colours lift themselves! Then oft they stroll'd to gaze upon the Castle, Or to the busy town beneath, whose harbour Crowded with entrances and exits, ever Supplied a moving, rich variety. And much they talk'd of their ascending hopes; And of their rival children; and the fire That shone already in their eyes, when fame And wealth and honours, and the distant grandeur, That far beyond the bounds of provinces Of petty circuit, stretch'd to grasp the world, And in dim vision they beheld the glories That after on their proud posterity Should fall! And here the fortune-teller came, And taking an unmarried damsel's hand, And archly looking in her timid eye, Said “Fair one, there is gloom upon thy countenance “Mix'd with those streaks of glowing light, which laugh “Rosily through the clouds! “I do not say these streaks of light shall conquer, “And keep off evil from thy future fate:— “Much shalt thou have to suffer! Yet infus'd “Into thy cup shall also be much joy! “E'en here upon thy natal spot shalt thou “Know some few years of pleasure in a love “Not unbecoming thee! But yet it shall “Be mix'd with cares, and terrors, and distractions, “And much thy thoughtless, but good-nature'd husband “Shall waste; and shall at last exhaust the patience “Of friends as well as foes; and then shall Ruin “Come irrecoverable; and sweep all! “And then again with weeping and convuls'd “Embraces shalt thou be withdrawn away, “With all thy little ones, across th'Atlantic, “And in American woods among barbarians “End thy last days!—O weep not, sigh not, tremble not! “Thou art a young enthusiast, and thou lovest “Glory; and dost delight to make the future “Over the present rule! Then let the flame “Of hope upon that swelling bosom play! “For of those little ones, who by thy side “Will weeping hang, and, when the stormy howl “Of billows o'er thy rolling vessel breaks, “Will shriek, and clasp thee, and for help from thee “Uselessly call, shall come a future race, “Whose sway shall o'er the northern Continent, “Thy destiny, be mighty! and whose name, “When future empires, threatning the old world, “Shall rise among the most renown'd, shall shine; “And Randolph's race,—and of their female blood “Intrepid patriot Jefferson,—shall trace “Their blood to thee!” Thus ended, the proud maid A golden tribute to the palm applied. Then smiling came a comrade, on the arm Of the fair damsel leaning; from the stock, And of the name, who from the town below The castle, came that day upon a visit. “And thou too, pretty one, went on the Gypsy, “Wilt hear thy fortune!—well; it shall be told; “And thou wilt not repent it! Look not sceptical! “Seest thou not at a distance, on the edge “Of the cliff sporting there, a manly form “Double thy girlish age! Not for a lover “Thou canst behold him now! He has already “A faithful wife! and see that little infant “Hanging in fearful gaiety on his skirts! “It is his only child! and not thro her “The name can be preserv'd! But let me whisper “Soft in thine ear; lest he should hear the secret “Of fate;—the mother of that little one “Will but a little while survive: and then— “Start not! yes, thou shalt be his wedded wife! “Now pause!—and think upon thy fate!—I have not “Yet told, what still more deeply may, perchance, “Affect thee! thou shalt have a son; but he “Shall die in youth; yet not before his father. “That father in the bloom of manhood shall “Sink to the grave; and in a little space “Thou shalt in other nuptials comfort seek! “Then of thee shall be born a child of lustre, “Who shall on Britain's woolsack sit with fame “Unrival'd, almost through a glorious reign; “And wealth and honours shall acquire, and found “A noble race of potent chiefs, and hold “Proud Hardwick's Earldom many a generation! “But dost thou ask what fate the little one, “To which thou shall be stepmother, may have? “I cannot tell thee all! I see before me “The spirit of a future trembling Being, “Who shall be a devoted morbid creature “Of all the Muses; and to him will fall “The lot, to tell the story of this little one: “For he from her will his corporeal blood “Draw; and full much of those from whom he springs “It will be his delight to tell,—defying “Envy's and folly's ever-ready censures; “And feeding his wild fancy with the thought, “That in the group of common blood, of those “Now met within my sight, there is a spirit “Of rarer intellect, not oft bestow'd “Through a whole race; and which shall long endure, “And not be in successive generations “Spent! But the world will still believe him wild, “And give but little credit to his visions!” And now the Gypsy vanish'd, and the mind Of each who heard her, with the mysteries Was touch'd; and thought by day, and dreamt at night, Of all the glimmering future. Of that future My task goes on th'unfoldings to relate. I have the birth related of the draper, Born in the ancient manor-house, abutting Upon the lofty cliffs oppos'd to Calais. Edward, the son, enlarg'd his father's dealings; And was a London merchant, of his class Among the first. At length ambition led him, Or most rapacious love of gain, to join Those windy projects, call'd the Southsea Bubble, Such as, though reason laughs at, were again Re-acted in this isle scarce six years past. Remote at length from natal spots, which went To strangers, he the evening of his days Clos'd near At Putney. that city, where the scene was plac'd Of his most busy, money-getting life. Then to another province his rich son Transplanted, spent his days with country squires. But for inheritance the paternal temper Knew not, diminishing the heap his sire Delighted to accumulate: a man Of moody humour—speculative, silent, Keeping lock'd up within his working brain His unsubstantial projects,—melancholy When what he hop'd had not succeeded, yet Not telling why!—and when death came, his fortune Found to be more than half dissolv'd away. And now we reach the child, to whom this song Is rigidly appropriate,—the immortal Historian of Declining Rome.—Lausanne, How much of that stupendous task didst thou Each morning shine upon! though not with thee The mighty project first arose. In Rome Itself the light of that gigantic scheme First broke upon the young and fervid author. Early emancipated from the trammels Of roofs paternal, he commenc'd to be, When yet a child, a winged citizen Of the wide world's exaustless climes and people. In that ill-form'd and feeble frame of body A rich, a vigorous, and plastic soul Resided, and in infancy began To seek for food out of the common reach. But all was bent upon the tale of man Acting beneath the chains of social ties, And form'd by artificial policy. First the false glare of oriental fable Attracted him: but by degrees the sober Investigation of that history, Now philosophic call'd, absorb'd the keen Yet patient faculties of his dissecting And critic mind. The wild imaginations Of range poetic were to him unknown. The reigning literature of the French school, And above others plausible Voltaire, Too much delighted and misled his taste, And made him sceptical, ironical, Piquant, and pointed, far beyond the bounds A pure and classic taste approves. In truth A genius of the highest tone and reach Did not belong to him! Even and formal, His style and thoughts in one unvarying mould Were cast. A constant balancing of periods, An artful application of one mode Of keen dissection and comparison, A calm resolve to measure, weigh, adjust; A stream clear, unperturb'd, and imperturbable, A patient industry, which, as 'twas calm, Was ne'er exhausted, erudition varied Of ancient and of modern lore,—combin'd To constitute a work unrival'd yet, And never likely to be fairly rival'd. In that most admirable edifice Of symmetry and grace, and rich materials Drawn from all learning's granaries measureless, The very Notes, brief, pointed, big with meaning And critical discussion, are alone Sufficient to secure immortal fame. The mind that such a subject could compress Into so small a space, in luminous Narration, had a faculty to pierce, Arrange, and recompose, which minds sagacious Must contemplate with wonder, and with ceaseless Praise. When upon th'Historian's windows shone The morning sun by Alpine heights reflected, With what a consciousness of tranquil pleasure He rose, his daily web to weave in threads Of golden light, that still engag'd the eye, Though of one endless pattern. Dear retreat, Where all the little passions of ambition, And restless vanity, and odious rivalry, Of that small world so ignorantly call'd The great, and fashion's ideotic judgments, The vile ennui of vile activity In most debasing trifles,—were forgot! Here the mind free to follow its own native Excursions, its own native pure emotions To suffer and to nurse; its own opinions To rest upon; by no rude blind resistance To be assaulted and confus'd, could give Full scope to its own energies. The turmoil Of agitated, agitating life, In the curs'd workings of the restless passions, In crowded walks of the stirr'd social world, Will not permit the gathering creations Of plastic minds to work themselves to form, And visible embodiment. In solitude Of natural unalloy'd sublimities, The spirits of th'invisible regions Come forth, and play the gambols on man's brain. In solitude a man may yet be wicked: In the world's crowded bustle, and loud stir Of imitation, he cannot be good! But are the fruits of mental genius goodness, If they be not true likewise, as they're able? They must as least have partial truth to give them The character of genuine genius! It is but feeble and affected talent, Which cannot truth elicit. If it can, And does not, then it is pure wickedness! Chang'd are the times: of yore the petit maître Of fashion was a very frivolous creature: And if the mighty and o'erwhelming flame, That overset the ancient dynasty Of France, was pregnant of predominant evil, It had some cleansing purgatives, and pour'd A vigour where naught reign'd but feebleness. All European manners had decayed Into effeminate artifice, and vice Of imitative luxuries, where refinement Of faint o'erpolish'd pleasures damp'd the soul. Then affectation run thro all the tastes And occupations of society, And literature, corrupted and unnerv'd, Languish'd in vapid and inane productions. But O ye breezes of the mountains, freshen'd By exhalations of the spreading waters, How bracing ye came o'er the frame relax'd Of Rome's Historian, when from London's smoke, Its feverish streets, its government corrupt, Its petty passions, its revolting forms, He threw himself in your sublime embrace! With what emotion I have visited, (As every traveller) the plain abode, The refuge where his daily task he plied: The little garden arbour, where he wrote, And the broad glorious prospect, which his pen With rapture celebrates. But he return'd! Affection call'd him to his native land; Fatigue of body to a frame diseas'd Gave aggravated injury: he linger'd But a few months in torture, and then died, Full short of the allotted age of man. Then did I lose the honour and delight, But just begun, of a reviv'd alliance! How little did I think, when I delay'd His offered visit from the petty fear A house unroof'd and full of noisy workmen Would incommode his delicate nerves, th'excuse Would close the opportunity for ever, And that in three short months he would be sleeping In the unhearing grave! He was a guest Once at thy table, Wootton, when his fate Plac'd him on Dover's heights, a soldier's duty To execute with his provincial corps! It does not seem as if, when in that castle, Which for a thousand years has bid defiance To haughty Gallia, he was well aware How near he was the sacred spot, whence sprung The long succession of his ancestors! Lively and clear was his imagination, Though somewhat quaint; and he, it seems, delighted With ancestorial fondness to look back On days long past. “And,” here when sitting calm Under the crowded and magnificent oaks Ofwood-crown'd Wootton, “here” he might have said “The little one, of which the Gypsy spoke, “To her fond father clinging, on the edge “Of those stupendous native cliffs, that hang “Over the Ocean frowning on the towers “Of Calais,—O yes, here the little one “In future days nurs'd up her manly brood “Sprung from my grandsires; and this gloomy boy, “Whose lightest auburn locks profusely flow “Upon his shoulders, and in whose dark eye “I can discern bright beams of casual flash “Piercing through darkness, has no vulgar hopes, “Or aptitudes: that shyness is the nurse “Of brooding thoughts and high imaginations; “And he, whate'er be his success, or fame, “Will give his soul to study and to fiction. “From him at last the line shall I recover, “By which the series of my ancestors “Deep into the ingulphing night of Time “I may with an unerring clue retrace! “And he shall honour me and mine, and boast “With reverential regard my name; “And when of princely blood, that in his veins “Flows by a thousand channels, he may talk, “Still uneclipsed me and mine shall he “Deem for th'intrinsic qualities of mind, “Which blaze, as he will argue, far above “Rank, riches, titles, kingdoms, worldly power!” And then he might cry, “Gypsy, come again, “And tell another tale, so full of pleasure, “As that which to my grandsires, and their fathers “And mothers, thou didst tell, ere we departed “From our paternal heritage, by guess “(And I would not miscalculate it), nearly “An hundred years ago! For as thou wert “A prophetess, I must believe thee spirit, “And thou perchance mayst still those woodlands haunt “And oft perhaps from Dover's cliffs, when storms “Rage, and the billows dash against the clouds, “And now aloft the groaning vessel rides, “And now sinks down again into the gulph “Of whelming waters, inland tak'st thy way, “And o'er the hills and vallies intervening, “A little southward to the left inclin'd, “Frequentest halls of squires, and hearths of cottagers. “O tell the chronicle of what has past “In those wild regions, since the name of Gibbon “Departed from its ancestorial lands! “But tell me most the future fate of him, “Who now addresses thee! Who burns with fire “Of fame, which yet he scarce can firmly dare “To hope will be fulfill'd to his ambition!” Thus to the Gypsy he perchance had spoken, And if he spoke it, were this lively Gypsy A very prophetess, she would have said “Thy hopes shall be fulfil'd, and thou shalt ride “Upon the wings of fame full mightily; “For many a year thy gorgeous web shall grow “Upon the Leman Lake; and when 'tis finish'd, “And to the world unroll'd, all eyes shall gaze “With admiration on it; but for thee “It shall thy doom be, to thy native land “In haste to come, the triumph to enjoy;— “But then alas! thine earthly days shall close!” And now, ye waters, and ye varied banks, Cloath'd with towns, castles, hamlets, and fair villas, What object next shall my Muse bring to notice? I see thy walls upraising from the waves Their massy towers, O Chillon! but on thee I hesitate to touch, for he, the Bard From Diodati's chateau, has already Blaz'd thee with modern notice: yet the song Is not amongst his happiest efforts there! If I may freely speak, the mystic strain Of modern affectation rules too much;— A catchy, forc'd, irregular, obscure, Distorted manner; a false air of swell And inspiration! The plain truth suffices To fill an uncorrupted reader's mind. The tale of Bonnivard the chroniclers Have told with more precision. It is full In modern books: the antiquarian searches Of Grenus and of Galiffe have again Brought it to light:—the hero of the story, A man of ardent spirit, and a lover Of liberty, a bold and firm reformer, Against the bigoted and tyrannic House Of Savoy a declar'd and open enemy. But he was rash, impetuous, and wild, Irregular in manners and opinions. He knew that Savoy's sovereign sought revenge For his resistances; and on his way Careless he ventur'd forth, trusting to faith Of those who ne'er had kept their word, when interest Or passion prompted them to disregard it! And thus his passport scorn'd, into the hands Disguis'd of that perfidious Prince he fell, Under the character of highway robbers, Who gave him up to the arch enemy. And then to Chillon's water-circled walls Was he transported: but at first not deep Into its dungeons: when at last, for cause Now unrecorded, he was low consign'd To those dark, damp, and deathlike prison vaults! Five years he linger'd there; nor is it easy To give belief that he could life and mind So long preserve in that terrific depth Of misery, since free again in limbs And buoyant spirits he came forth, and liv'd Yet a few years. But fitter for the Chronicler Than for the Muse is this minute discussion: Nor dare I dwell upon a tale, which Byron With firey and o'erwhelming pen has touch'd. What the great mind, with native powers endow'd, By resolution and by industry, Can do, no sage perchance has yet expounded. It cannot utterly o'ercome the pangs And faults of body; but it nearly can Effect this mighty conquest, and to spirit Raise the clay-mould. Perchance the firey mind In damp and cold may make the current flow Of earthly blood; and may o'erpower the darkness Of death itself: but 'tis the loss of hope And self-reliance that destroys the spell. Then the blood chills, and at the mercy falls Of all external and material things. “What we believe that we can do, we can do;” Possunt, quia posse videntur. And want of confidence destroys all power. Thus genial beams of fame, and the gay cheers Of others, can alone bring forth the fruits Of many a rich but timid spirit, which Knows not its own puissance, till the warmth Of praise acts on it: without sun what fruit Can ripen? and then who will toil, and toil, Hopeless of recompence, and unassur'd That these fatiguing toils give use or pleasure? We cease to sing to those who will not hear; We waste not voices on the passing breeze; We frame not long creations that may lie Folded and hid within our own scrutoires. The love of fame, if it but be a love That follows worthy labours, is a passion Virtuous, in degree as it is warm. He who is dull to it, is selfish, sensual, And impotent of aught sublime or fair. What traveller thro Europe's bounds has left The sight of thee, Geneva, unregarded? Where mighty bards have trod, I ever look, And see their visions hang upon the spot! And you, ye idols of my childhood, manhood, And latest age, O Milton, and O Gray, Hither, when bending to sublime Italia Your breathless footsteps, with delight ye came, And tarried on the noble heights of Jura, To gaze upon the bursting lake before you, And snow-clad, craggy, numberless, in height And shape forever varied, Alpine summits, Crown'd by Mont Blanc, his head among the clouds, Gainst which the sun's resisted beams of gold In vain their flames impell'd! a fate congenial Guided your purposes! Your taste, your feelings, Your erudition, your commanding strength Of reason, your deep love of meditation And solitude, your eye to nature's charms Open, enraptur'd, curious; glowing words, Exalted, picturesque; the holy flame Of most profound devotion, simple fare, And simple garb, and hate of worldly races, And worldly tracks of base ambition, and Of craving appetite of worldly lucre! There are perchance who will condemn this union Of men unequal in the quantity Of fruits which they behind them left, if not In quality and essence! 'Twill be said, The latter Bard has no creative powers Display'd; and that without creation none Dare to the fame aspire of mighty poets. The grand invention of the Epic, Gray Never, 'tis true, attempted: but his lyrics Are with invention rich of ornament At least, if not design. It was the fault Of morbidness, that wither'd in the bud All the magnificent fruits, that in the fountains Of his resplendent genius glanc'd, and died! Ample and bright creation lay within The compass of those vigorous burning powers; But sorrow from his cradle, the keen sufferings Of a fond mother, the base moodiness Of a sour, selfish, rash, and spenthrift father, Fix'd an incurable gloom upon his heart. Not so heroic-minded Milton: he, Tho not th'advancement worthy of his merit He found, and tho his Muse found few If audience fit, yet bated not a jot Of hope; nay, rather gave full effluence To a mind overflowing with grand thoughts And gorgeous imagery. But the times of trouble, When civil discord stain'd the fields with blood, Came, and the Bard to liberty's defence Gave all the studies of his days and nights. And when his eyes, “in this sublime defence O'erplied,” their vision lost, his spirit sunk not, But rising in gigantic energy Of inward light, as outward objects, shut From his perception, were as if they were not, His faculties miraculous, of high Creation, glow'd with more abundant brightness. Ah! with what exquisite intensity Of mental pleasure did his moments pass, Thus occupied, while Gray in sad ennui Linger'd away a life, where in the bosom The fire pent up, smoulder'd in smoke away. Then came the sickness of the heart; the blood Poison'd with vapours; and the limbs convuls'd; And death, a kind releaser. Ere the course Of nature, duly exercised, had brought This earthly being to an end, had seeds Of glowing genius, congregated in The narrow limits of a feeble frame, Consum'd the boundaries of their abode. Short was the sojourn that the lyric Bard Made on the beautiful expanse, Geneva, Of thy sweet rainbow-painted waves, embosom'd In mountains of a thousand shapes and colours, Nor yet had met his heart, or caught his ear The music of thy magic words, Rousseau! O with what rapture, when they reach'd him, did His bosom and his fancy drink them in! In vain we search the processes of mind, And causes of the different characters Of human genius. Rocks, and mountains, lakes, And all the wonders of sublimity In nature's forms, had seem'd to be the proper Food of poetic and creative faculties. Not so experience of the happier spirits Born on the borders of the Leman waters: Studies of graver cast are theirs; to sciences Exact are bent their labours; and of fancy They deem the lights are but delusive vapour. Strange thought! but judging from the common cup Of drink, produc'd as nectar, which assumes The name of poetry, less far removed From truth, than critics may at first suppose. The draught, which the corrupted multitude Joys in, with every nauseous stimulant Is mingled in predominant excess. It is a false exhilaration, pregnant With every poison. But what is real poetry? Not folly;— But highest truths told in the highest manner! To them all sciences are merely naught;— They teach the movements of the soul;—the actions Of the most susceptible heart; the thoughts, Which not cold reason, but the holy fire Of inspiration, dictates. Not to dress In childish ornaments most common objects, And make them pass for wonderful with vulgar And ideotic minds: not with vain toil The fillagree of costly gold and silver Into fantastic forms to work, that eyes, Of curious trifles passionate, may gaze on; But to throw lights into those depths, where only Imagination's flame can pierce;—the secrets, Which most it man behoves to know: for what Comparatively is the boasted science Of vegetation, animal, material Life, and its laws? But that which represents The spirit in fantastic and untrue Manner discharging its fine operations, Is not the lesson of the genuine Muse. Truth is a beauty, which rejects in scorn All empty ornament; and most rejects it, When it would cover faults: the tricky glare O' the painter, who essays to draw attention By tints unchaste, graceless, extravagant, The universal scorn incurs. Not so The labouring, turgid, falsely-swelling poet. Oft for a time he captivates the multitude, And e'en the critic, who aspires to know A lesson far above the multitude's Pretensions. He who takes a composition, Which aims at praise poetic, and when read, Has learn'd no lesson of sound wisdom from it, Has spent his moments on a fruit not genuine. In our old poets who enjoy'd a name, There is not ought but wisdom: there we seek For lore profound of moral science, vers'd In all the nice perplexities, which fate Ordains that man by study should evolve! Thus Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Cowley, Davenant; Thus Davies, Waller, Butler, Denham, Dryden, And Pope and Prior, and neglected Harte: Thus old George Sandys, and even Wither's Muse, Once vulgar deem'd.—To fountains such as these Of living waters, he who seeks for knowledge Of life must go; and day and night must linger Over their springs; and in their memories, And in their hearts, retain the bright impression Of their exhilaration and their incense. But from the Muse I see a frown, and hear Her angry voice! “Hast thou forgot,” she cries “One of my favorite and most gifted votaries?” Oblivion not to be forgiv'n! O thou, Of whom though not in metre, every word Was poetry, O mellow, wise, enchanting, O moralist, with fiction's magic rich, O graceful, eloquent, affecting Addison; O glory of most chaste and beautiful language, Of pure, illumin'd, accurate, and deep Thought, and in all the nicer shades of ethics An oracle of never-erring judgment! How could I for a moment thee forget? But darkness soon came on;—and darkness long Has been with light profusely intermingled. Genius has flash'd; but lightning false, and thunder, By th'artificial workmen of the stage, Have caught the public eye and ear, and fascinated With most corrupt and foolish admiration! Hobgoblins as deform'd and forc'd, as play Their part upon a country stage to ignorant, Open-month'd, hair-upstanding, rustic gazers, Have won the laurel for most empty heads! And thus the mob will hug th'absurd, before The graceful and the just. But far away Have I again departed from my theme! Coppet, of thee my Muse has early spoken: And something of the brilliant emanations Of deeply-meditating, somewhat dark, And labour'd priestess of wise oracles, The passionate De Staël, has she essay'd! But Coppet's chateau other sages knew, A century before. There critic Bayle A portion of his controversial life Pass'd. The incessant labours of a mind Acute, investigating, fervid, sceptical, Delighting in dissection, yet preserve An undiminish'd interest. But ill Conflicts with good in measuring the value Of those sharp mental fruits. A mind that seeks For faults and for objections, is too apt To contemplate but parts,—and not the whole. Thus Bayle: for grand and general views he never With comprehensive pencil could dash out. With microscopic eye he search'd and found The petty contradiction and defect. To take for granted nothing; to doubt ever, Is not the part of wisdom! But another,— A minister of State, on whose ability And wisdom, not full half a century Gone by, the destiny of mighty France, And thence of civil rule and kingly power Throughout the world, depended, was the lord Of this domain, and here in age and grief, And disappointment, anxious cares, and danger, Spent his last clouded days. Insane conceit, Self-estimate delusive, vanity, And unchastised ambition, led astray A mind and heart for an inferior station Well fitted, and in humbler labours wise And virtuous! Necker was a charlatan In politics, and did not see how little The hocus-pocus of the desk can change The wealth of nations, and financial trick, And gamblings on th'exchange, can operate Upon a nation's want of means to meet The exigences of its actual costs. O strange delusion in a numerous people, Ingenious, fertile in resources, clear, To lore both moral and political Happily fram'd, but turbulent, and changeable, And light, and vain. It was a fatal blindness Which made the rich financier trust his powers For such a function in such frightful times, When all the waves were roaring, and o'erleaping Their bounds. Full little of the history Of th'human heart knew he; or of the wheels By which the politics of states are mov'd;— A man of abstract notions, full of saws, And figures to direct the counting house By rule and measure, and methodical Arrangement. O 'twas always “the account— Th'account deliver'd!” and the task was done In his conception, and the storm must cease, And waters must subside, and the fond dove Come forth in safety, and the olive pluck! That such a simple creature should suppose He held the wand of wisdom, would be strange, Did we not see that folly rules the world! But O how bitter must have been the workings Of disappointed hope and foil'd ambition, When in this solitude, which lonely breezes Moaning along the lake made lonelier, Or where the tempest, nurs'd among the gorges Of the gigantic snow-clad ridgy mountains, Made to the heart diseas'd and vex'd more gloomy, The vain proud ostentatious fallen man Reflected on the issues of his toils, His speculations, his miscarriages! “O do not hold” as on the banks he roam'd, Or from his window saw the morning dawn Glance on Mont-Blanc's cloud-cover'd top, “O do not “Hold such a melancholy tone! I am not “Nerv'd for the voices of the elements!— “The voice of man in social life, the music “Of streets, saloons, conclaves, and palaces, “Befits my sicken'd soul, to give it comfort; “Poets may talk of mountains, lakes, and torrents, “And woods and hills and vallies! I believe, “It is but affectation! Man for man “In social life was form'd:—there is no other “Delight in our existence. Nature torn “By storms, or billows, or the threatening burst “Of fire destructive darting thro the skies, “Why should it be delightful to refinement “In human habits? Rather let the savage “Rejoice in that which not the polish'd arts “Of social man have into being brought! “If my ambition's projects had succeeded, “The music of saloons, the bending knee, “The reverential tone of deep applause, “Had met me morn and night; and had shut out “The roar of elements, and the depressing “Shadows of savage nature! I am now “A poor deserted store-diminish'd man, “Whom none regard; on whom a tribe ferocious “Full often thirst to dip their hands in blood: “But still I doubt not, 'tis a foolish world, “Not I, have been in error!—I will write! “My pen is still my pleasure—and will shew “By figures, and by mathematical “Proof, that I ever was myself in the right, “And all the world was wrong! For who is ignorant, “There is no certainty except in figures! “All else is vague conjecture, and vile, shadowy “Fancy, of vapours and inanity “Bred, and in useless smoke mounts and expires.” END OF BOOK III. BOOK IV. When the world sleeps, then best my task I ply;— Then from the world's obtrusions I repose Secure; and as a breath, a frown, a word, Can discompose me, the security Nurses the workings of my morbid spirit! There are who censure such infirmities, As but the fancies of vile whim and humour: But they are men, who draw their judgments from The hardness of their own froze hearts and heads. He, to whom fate the labour has assign'd The mental loom to work, must necessarily Have nerves and feelings finer than the vulgar; And be more quickly sensible to wrong, Insult, and taunt, or e'en the laugh of eye, The scorn disguis'd, the hidden disapproval, The treachery that lurks within the heart Of rivalry or envy. But the outward Evils of life, that by the glare of day Assault us, when contending man is busy Upon the stage, in mischief ever rife, These interrupt incessantly our progress Under the broad sun's beams: then thee, O Night, I hail, and in thy silence and repose My web goes on in regular advance. To see the task grow under us, and, night By night, its palpable increase exhibit, Sustains our energies, and nurses hope. It is gradation, which in life supports The waste of labour. He, who finds the days Of his strait-bound existence waste away, Yet nothing done, and no progression made, Sickens, and loses all the moving force That carries on the fruitful labourer. With nothing done, and nothing we can do, Ennui consumes us; and when of to-morrow Our prospect only is the self-same thing, Th'internal organs almost cease to work; There is no breath of hope to drive them on! The idle are of men the most unhappy: Peril, and toil extreme, and injury, And ceaseless crosses; insult, treachery, Disease, and all the agonies of mind And body, more enjoyment know by fitful Contrasts, than vapoury stagnant idleness: And he, who has not tried his powers, can never Guess the extent of their capacity. Step after step, year after year, they often Expand, and see the thickest clouds before them Dissolve, and distant objects, which it seem'd Impossible to reach, come nearer, nearer, Till they are touch'd. Short lives have numerous days And nights, of which if not e'en one is lost, Much may be done by them: but when the thread Is far spun out, to what a wonderful Amount may human labour raise the heap! By constant exercise the powers, within The little circle of the human skull, Contain a world of more sublimity, And beauty, and of brilliance, than the outward Globe, and the fair creations on its surface, Shew even to the clearest, most intelligent, And most enquiring and most sensitive eye. But yet sometimes the fury of the flame, And dazzle of the blaze, is too consuming For man's weak body, and he dies, or falls Into irrevocable disarrangement. The faculties may flame till they burn up! It is the conscience, that perchance may calm And methodise them; an o'erruling care To give a due direction to their energies! There are around us spirits, who will aid Our virtuous efforts; but who yet will leave us To our own wickedness, if vice prevails In our first thoughts, and we make no endeavour T'aspire to good. It is a mystery, Whence come our earliest aspirations! If they come from external interference, Then wherefore are we made responsible? If they spring up within us, ere our reason Can operate, then also does it seem Hard to condemn us! Yet it may be said, When reason comes, it ought to moderate, Repress, and new-direct.—Alas, in vain Into these mystic works of mind we dive! We cannot tell why faculties of mind, Of heart, of temper, so extremely variant, Are given at our birth;—and why the chance Of happiness, both earthly and hereafter, Is so diversified, and different, In quality and in degree! We know not, If in a preexistent state our conduct May not have brought this seeming distribution Of inequality upon our doom! But we must ever keep our faith in darkness, That Providence is just! The noblest beings Humanity produces, are yet frail; And close, familiar, nice inspection will Shew a few spots;—a few sad weaknesses Of heart; a few defaults of mind unsound; Of temper a few strange perversities! And all may be forgiven but disguise; But curst hypocrisy, of sins the worst, The mother of all other sins; of falsehood The dire and inextinguishable brooder! Where once it enters, there the energies Are turn'd to poison, and the streams of life Corrupted; and the voice is from a blessing Turn'd into ill; and bears the breath of wrong, Delusion, treachery, extortion, ruin! The hypocrite no single quality, Good, generous, or e'en neutral, can possess; And in hell flames for ever he will burn! The devil there has hold of him entire, And he will treat him for his lawful prey. My flight is as the disobedient hawk's, Who, by the falconer let loose to chase His prey, darts off beyond his destined objects, And takes his airy circuits out of sight, And tarries ere he hears his master's call. But close again, O Lake, upon thy banks, Burgundian and Alpine, I will fix My meditations.—Lofty-mounted villa, La Boissière! thou dost turn thy noble front Upon a glorious prospect! Genthod, thou More humble in thy site, and somewhat dank The vapours of the Lake appear around thee; But by a curious Sage, of mind aspiring, And ardent industry, once consecrated! All Europe rings of Bonnet's name! La Boissière, By Tronchin honour'd, name in the Republic Held dear for ages, yet to him who venerates Rousseau's unrival'd genius and hard fate, Somewhat obscur'd by a dark stain of bigotry, And persecution sharp and little merited! But ye, dear villas, both of you the haunts Of genius, which my song has hitherto Left unregarded! if I love the lore Of eloquent and most enlighten'd history,— As in my heart I do,—why have I thee, Illustrious Müller, with neglect so long Treated? Thou art a shining star, to chase The gather'd clouds from tales of ancient days! In erudition rich, in genius strong, By ardent passions borne upon thy way, Copious in sentiment, in moral wisdom Flowing and ever varied; seeing deep Into the heart of man, in language vigorous And clear; laborious and exact as those Who have no fountains of their own; concise And comprehensive, although overflowing! It may be doubtful if the Muse should ever Mix with the world. In actual life is aways A coarseness, which deranges her creations. Is it then ask'd, how she should know mankind, Their manner, and their passions? By the light Of her imagination, which will give A true view; ever deep,—not on the surface! O sad reality! There is in Man Of base and selfish passions a predominance! And he who mingles with society In daily conflict, comes at last to bend His mind to all its tricks and artifices; For in the world by manners delicate, And course of action pure, we cannot long Proceed! without a spot and stain incurable There is no wordling! Fair at first full many May seem; but there is poison in the heart! Then I will close my doors again, and live Only within myself. O books! O study! Ye never can fatigue, or be exhausted! As the mind labours, it still stronger grows, And every day the mist recedes, and opens New prospects, and perplexities untie Themselves, and clues sharpen and multiply. The clock strikes Five; and yet my morning task Is scarce begun! Of stupifying sleep I have too much enjoy'd! But I must farther Into broad day extend my' allotted toils! What though with many a cold look, many a sneer, The web goes on, it has not yet relax'd, Nor shall relax,—though every intermixture With the world's bustle much endangers it. On Solitude and on Society Philosophers have written and disputed. Thus eloquent and most pure-hearted Cowley;— Thus learned Evelyn;—but as poets ever Write the best prose, so did the bard excell The natural philosopher, though he Had written of woods and trees with love and science. He, to whom nature has not given the boon, Labours in vain, and learning is but weight Injurious to the head, which has not springs To bear it, and throw off the groaning pressure. Let e'en the most ingenious well beware, How far they give an idle trust to memory's Obtruded stores;—for what is ready made, Is tempting, but still valueless. The borrow'd Is empty in the utterance of the borrower. That which a man repeats, unless he thinks it, Is vapoury wind. The head is all delusions Without the testimony of the heart! “O what prosaic common-place!” exclaims The would-be critic: “not a flower of poetry! “No image;—no invention: not an art, “Or spell, we call for in the Muse! but truth, “Plain truth, or that which so affects to be! “Why, I had always held that poetry “Consists in fiction! We can have plain truth “In prose abundantly: and from the bard “A world unlike ourselves we hope to see, “Dress'd up with all the ornaments, the finery “Of labouring art can give it:—golden words, “And sounding metre by harmonious rule! “Of our old poets this is not the fashion, “We know too well: but if we speak with frankness, “We must admit, that praise of these old strains “Is but a prejudice; and from boasted Milton, “Left to ourselves, we nothing draw but slumbers! “It is a task to read him;—not a pleasure, “As pedants strive with most affected praise “To make us think! In our own days the Muse “The notes of genuine merit first has reach'd! “Look at the splendor of her imagery! “Look at the rich creation of her scenes, “And characters and language! at the magic, “In which she deals! the mystic passionateness; “The wonders;—the inhabitants of air; “Goblins and ghosts, and monsters of the fancy, “Which seize the soul with wonder; bear it off, “And lap it in Elysium! Here the Muse “Shines in her proper sphere; and should be worship'd.” Thus he, who in the school of art has learn'd His lessons cold and technical. Not I In that misleading school was taught! And now Fearless my own opinions I pronounce; And fearless act upon them! In my age My literary destiny is fix'd; And I no longer tremble at the will Of the capricious multitude. To speak With frankness is a high delight, that satisfies The conscience, and is never persecuted By cloud-chasing ennui, or the keen dart Of irresistible regret! The heart, When unoppos'd, unforc'd, is ever right. 'Tis Sunday! The church bells all ring around, And float upon the Lake; and on the breeze Mount to my windows! yet not far they reach, By Jura and by Alps to be reechoed: But in the lightsome atmosphere, which streams Of current airs do purify, the sounds Are to the ear and bosom stirring music. To live among the grandeurs, and the beauties Of nature, varied in their forms and tints, Awakens, deepens, fortifies, and fires The energies of mind. The changing hues Of the blue vault of Heaven create delight: But where the surface of the earth is flat, Those changes are less frequent and more faint. Not joys material these: upon the brain And bosom they depend; and only move, As they associate with the shadowy tribes Of mental essence. Yet it must be own'd, Imagination does not here prevail; But logic cold; and hard experiment: And what are call'd the natural sciences, Though somewhat strangely call'd! The mind is nature, And of the highest order: mind to study, Is man's most elevated toil and duty! What science so essential? what requires Faculties so refin'd, and so sagacious? If brother-men alone by their external Semblance we know, how trivial is that knowledge; How by false surfaces it is misleading! Into the heart Imagination only Can look; and have access unto the shrine, Where all the passions play! Who does not view Daily these operations, is unknowing Of the great science of humanity. O search not what is strange! O do not think, Because it no one's head or heart before Enter'd, 'tis therefore excellent! It is When others give responses, and acknowledge The thought and feelings are exactly such, As are familiar to the secret movements Of their own minds, that the due test is reach'd Of genuine genius. And whoever leads His listeners into error on the character Of man; his modes of thought; his sensibilities; His estimates of life; and of the objects Of nature; is an oracle of falsehood; A wicked conjurer! Eternal truth Is the sole object man should have in search. It is of these false oracles the most Of censurers speak, when they condemn the Muses, As filling minds with mischievous delusions, And irritating them to evil passions! Extravagance, exaggeration, monstrous Union of incompatible elements, Is but the joinery of a vile artist! Trite are these protests; said a thousand times:— But they cannot too often be repeated! It is upon extravagance the candidates For th' laurel now their chief pretensions place! It is extravagance the public calls for, And deems it proof of most decisive merit! Thus æras new of poetry have risen; Thus Milton, Dryden, Pope, are tame; thus readers, As writers, swell like the balloon inflated With gas! Into the heavens they travel high; But there learn nought; and down they fall again, Oft by a perilous descent; and sometimes To death itself. It is but the insanity Of inspiration false,—of false contortions, And Phaetonic flights! and the cure lies In studying Milton's most severe and plain Passages;—his most unadorned lore Of moral and divine philosophy. Beautiful is description of the scenes Of Nature as she is: but beautiful, And sublime also, is the exhibition Of mystic mind; its workings; and th'opinions Thence drawn; the axioms, rules, directions Of life's most intricate and thorny ways! Then when the heart, and not the intellect, Ought to decide, comes elevation, majesty, And fortitude, to make the right resolve! Why do we call for imagery? forever Imagery!—as if all were materialists; And nothing better?—If the mind distinguishes Man above other creatures, 'tis the nature Of the mind is the most exalted subject Poets can deal with.—Nothing in the strain Of poets reaches excellence, that is not Mingled of all the faculties of mind, Fancy, imagination, passion, reason, Judgment, and memory;—and above all Sagacity—a power of mind distinct, Yet little notic'd separately: it is A gift intuitive; a light, that comes From heaven; and flashes its intelligence Unlabour'd and unsought:—thus comes the strain The voice of wisdom's self; and not a tale Of th' nursery, which ignorance, and dulness Affecting gravity, dare to pronounce it! But least of all the play of words, the tinsel Of gorgeous and unmeaning emptiness, Is pardonable, though it gain the cheer Of foolish fashion! It is a gold leaf, As valueless as that which makes a glitter On the child's gingerbread:—a group of wonders, As silly as the rude magician's At country fairs: no real secret taught; No solid knowledge given! The true Muse Speaks, what in gravest questions we may cite; The judgment of the most intelligent, And most profound;—the consciencious edict Of holy and inspir'd determination! O glittering expanse of waves cærulean, What have I learn'd from thee? Full many a year I've dwelt upon thy banks, and much I've thought, And read, and learn'd, and dream'd, and seen in vision By day, and have by mental toil created: And I have suffer'd much in mind and body; But yet I trust I have advanc'd in wisdom, And also in both elevation, And purity of heart. There is a rectitude, To which the whole ambition of our minds Ought to be bent: the plausible, the cunning, The selfish,—ah, how base it is! The world It may advance us in; but not one moment Can it give satisfaction to the conscience: It is in solitude, and in our own Internal feelings, we must truly live. There is a monitor within, which always Tells us when we have struck upon the right. Long in a mist we travel;—all around, Is seen by glimpses; and e'en as our eyes Are eager, and our apprehension pants To grasp at all, confusion multiplies, And long we see less clearly than the dull. But the clouds move away with time, and labour, And patience; while the added mist of passion Subsides; and strength, and brightness, and tranquillity, And fortitude, and sentiment exalted, Combine, and give that self-dependence, which Constitutes power, and strict ascendancy Of character! But in the scornful estimate Of the mole-eyed practitioner in cavils, Much have I trifled;—wanting method, unity Of purpose and of labour; pleas'd with fictions, And baubles; searching curiosities Not worth the cost of time, or waste of intellect; And scribbling in profusion what the pruning knife, Or polish of the file, has ne'er receiv'd. O, how uncandid, and how ignorant, And dull, to call on all to rule themselves By one unvaried method! Let the candidates For fame, pursue a thousand different paths; Yet equally at the same end arrive! The pruning knife, the file, may be to some Instruments necessary; but to others They may be death; they may let out the sap, And wither up the pores; and clear away The tints and features, strength, and character! With some all is in the first burst of thought, And language that comes with it; and cold labour Not mends, but at each anxious touch destroys it. All that is grand or tender, is the dart Of inspiration. Who will doubt that Shakespeare, Without premeditation or correction, Pour'd forth the torrents of his magic strains? Fast as the swift uninterrupted stream, Hasten'd his mind his lips and pen, and stop'd not To mend what was sufficient for his purpose. From labour comes obscurity, confusion Of metaphors, abruptness, and the break Of natural associations, Of thought, and imagery, and sentiment. There may be sound; and outwardly a fair Array of rich poetical ideas; But it is only to the ear and eye,— Not to the head or heart. They are but sounds Tinkling, and shadows of factitious spirits! The bard cannot rehearse but what he sees, Hears, and believes, the moment of his utterance. The genuine poet cannot be affected; The ferment of his bosom would at once Throw off all veil, all labour'd artifice; And render the whole process of disguise, And shape unnatural, impossible! Who ever reads the mighty bard of Avon, And for a moment has to seek his meaning? Who ever in his airiest, loftiest flights, Of visions even most imaginative, Did not in his own fancy find a mirror And echo? Wherefore this, but that he wrote Only what Nature prompted and believed? O do not give the name of art to poetry! It is not art! It is a true infusion Of portions of the great Creator's power! The poet is not gifted with the faculty Creative over matter: but the spiritual He can create, and with a living force, Which is reality, and operates On matter like the tribes of mind, sent forth E'en by the omnipotent Deity himself! Upon thy banks, O Lake, much have I mused, And sometimes in new tracks pursued my searches. In lands far distant from our natives homes Our minds expatiate with more liberty: All local prejudices, which 'tis difficult To clear by th' root, there by degrees give way, Nor leave a trace behind. Then we become True citizens of a capacious world. Around our infancy too oft have grown Some early fears, affections, hatreds, envies, Which cloud the mind and heart; and are rank spots To be wip'd cleanly out. Man cannot judge Of man, till those impressions deep, we took In childhood, are effac'd; where accident Works upon weakness. Thro' the globe the same Minds, passions, virtues act; and we may seek Genius and learning spread in every clime; And best perchance, we seek it far from home, Because we there judge with more equal candour, And are not sensible of petty vapours, Bred in the morbid sensibility Of some diseased part, in youth contracted. Fresh airs, moreover, give a novelty Of strength to parts, where the mind has been worn, And its due figures somewhat clouded over, Or twisted and deform'd. New objects give An impulse to the current of the blood, And chasing the invigorated stream Thro the sick bosom, rise in brilliancy Of their gold-tinted sprays up to the brain, And fortify the frame and soul together! Such aid, O Mountain Lake, I owe to thee! To keep the mind in vigour there perchance Something of time and place and opportunity Requires. To live to future ages, asks A spirit and a mellowness of fruit Of intellectual faculties, not fashion'd Merely to the caprices of the moment. Fashions with every generation change: But the attraction which depends on fashion, Becomes disgusting to its successor: And he, who has no other, dies forever, And is forgotten. Truth, and style, and genius Are the same always. Passion, as she's frank, And unaffected, speaks with little difference After the lapse of centuries: the characters Of Shakespeare in their moments of excitement Vary not from the modern day, while authors Of note inferior speak another language, Which even in their own time was most quaint, Most artificial, and affected. Thus Would want of inspiration ever try To fill the place of genius. E'en in Chaucer After four centuries, the style, and colour, Accent, and collocation of the words, Is still the same, wherever there is freedom, And fire and vigour rising above art And labour. Mere affected scholars write The language of the day; but genuine bards, And busy statesmen of original And powerful minds, in one enduring tone Pour forth the workings of their mighty bosoms, And intellectual effervescences. Thus when the language is found obsolete, Labour'd, distorted, overdress'd, the thought Is not worth seeking: either 'tis not genuine, Or it is triteness hid in ornament. Discoverers in science may be useful; But all their merits are transmissible: They are, like money, things of circulation, And equally available to all. But the fine essence of imaginative Genius eludes transmission, and thus lives And breathes alone in the identical words Of its creator. Therefore poets live Forever in the presence of posterity. Rousseau, most eloquent, and most seducing Creator, who thy magic language can Transfer to his own pages? It escapes In the vain trial, and expires in air! Intensity was thine of most ideal Happiness:—in the world thou wert not good! The world excited all thy evil passions; And solitude thy virtuous! Foolish censurer, Who deems thee not sincere, because thine actions Do not to th'effusions of thy mind accord! Thou couldst not write that, which thou didst not feel! Thy lakes, and rocks, and mountains;—of thy childhood The haunted scenes! how couldst thou fly from them, And seek for shelter among unknown strangers? Thou foundst it in a kind but wanton dame, To whom perchance much of corrupt in thee Was owing! O how strange and mingled was The tissue of thy life! The mixed threads Of wild insanity were ever there: And thy predominant fancy ever rul'd thee, As if th'ideal objects were material! Perhaps thou couldst not overcome the visits, Unsought by thee, of spiritual presences! And if they would inebriate thy soul With hopes delusive, and mislead thy faith In beauties, which existed not on earth, Not to thy conscience would the crime belong! How different from Voltaire! to him each fault Of envy, hatred, artifice, was deep Premeditation, laid to bring about Some wicked end! When in that habitation, Which now I see before me, he survey'd The rolling lake, and saw the evening sun Reflected from Mont-Blanc, and heard in nights Of wintry darkness cross his windows come The howling storm, that rode upon the waters, By mountain torrents fed, he no sublimity Of soul experienc'd; but alone he mus'd Upon the world, its wit, its fashions, follies; On artificial man;—on imagery, Merely as secondary instruments To dress his studied and factitious thoughts! Better were he mix'd in the levity Of gay Parisian streets, than circled by Cragg'd rocks of everlasting snow, and lonely Expanses of cloud-tinted waters, sounding Only with nature's echoes from the torrents Of ice-bound wintry rains, dissolv'd by spring;— Or the scarce audible halloo of bargemen Descending with their loaded freights. To him, Whose converse is with human wit and cunning, All nature's grandeur is but ennui! In wit abundant, in mere spriteliness Of intellect ingenious, clear, judicious, Where is the sentiment, th'imaginary, The fair, the tender, the sublime, in him The Lord of Ferney, still gay France's idol! Why should we wonder, that a nation cherishes A bard, the very mirror of itself? It will be argued that to know mankind, Not as they ought to be, but as they are, Is the most useful knowledge. The position Is plausible;—but yet it is delusive. By lonely study we may also know Man as he is; but not as he amid The conflict of the crowded city is, But in the purity of solitude, Nurs'd in the loftiness of nature's charms, And only conversant with nature's voice. There is a baseness in the constant force, With which men's faults and weaknesses are spied, Where all excites a jest, or witticism, Or sharp rebuke. More specious than profound, The multifarious writer thus proceeds: All follow him, and all delight in him; For all most easily can apprehend him. Rousseau demands a passionate heart, and visionary Fancy. Of him the lyric Gray has spoken, With adoration of his eloquence And beauties. But there is another Sage, Of name imposing, and whose luminous judgment Most rarely errs; and he with bitterness Of critical aspersion has condemn'd This fam'd Genevan citizen to ignominy. Of revolutionary anarchy The advocate of ancient institutions Deem'd him the fire-brand: for the supposition Of this black crime th'enthusiastic Burke Could find no mercy. It is true the mobs Of radical destruction on their lips Had ever Rousseau's name: but he perchance Was far too subtle and too tender for them: And much it may be doubted, if he added To the long-laid and wide spread elements Of blood-thirsty explosion. His own native City shut also its barr'd gates to him; And burnt his eloquent disquisitions On man's political rights with too much bigotry, And harsh injustice;—not to say servility To other states,—unheard, unsummon'd, and Absent in distant lands,—and though the crime,— If crime it was,—was not with them committed. Look at the candour, and the charity, And simple grief, with which on that occasion Th'eloquent citizen bemoan'd his fate. His country was a stepmother to him, And yet the high of its inhabitants Cherish'd the ceaseless hatreds of their sires Against him, still insensible to all The glory, on their ancient walls he brought! Hatred political but rarely wars With the illustrious dead! And who, like Rousseau, In splendid genius 'mong Genevan annals Shines! That the native of a small republic Should war with kings, and courts, and luxuries,— Is this surprising? Liberty he lov'd: It was of th'very essence of his mind And heart: and yet he found that liberty Not always in republics flourishes. There oligarchies rule too frequently; And factions rage, and acts of cruel tyranny Are practis'd by the wantonness of powers New-got. In France the charg'd conspiracy Of philosophic politicians May be suspected to have credit for More active mischief than it did: the seeds Were laid far more remotely; the destruction Of the last remnant of the constitution By Medicean tyranny and intrigue, After the death of the heroic Henry, And the Grand Louis' despot power, and wasteful Ambition, form'd a mine, whose sure explosion, In its due hour all statesmen wise foresaw. Thus the sagacious, veil-withdrawing chief Of French memorialists, the wise Saint-Simon, Foretold, long ere the club'd Encyclopedists Their poison hid in flowers, thro' every page Spread: for the unendurable corruption Of the grand monarch's court must have at last Rous'd the most servile and neck-broken people! And thou, magician, exil'd from thy country, Wide o'er the earth in care and sorrow wandred'st; Then didst thou pass the ocean straits 'twixt Calais And Dover; and beneath the white cliffs landed, Didst see the fields of liberty, so call'd, And Cantium's meadows green, and gentle hills, And winding vallies; and its peasantry, Ruddy and neatly clad; and its bluff manners, And scorn of strangers, and provincial pride; The haughty castle frowning o'er the waves, The Conqueror took from Harold, slain at Hastings; And yet a few leagues inland o'er the downs, Where Cæsar once encamp'd, the rising tower Lofty, and beautiful in gothic symmetry, Of that far-fam'd Cathedral, where St.-Austin Preach'd, and where Becket of his blood incurr'd The forfeit for his pride prelatical! But thy capricious humour could not brook The coldness of a melancholy people, And thy Theresa, to whose wicked temper, And devilish arts, thou didst commit thy happiness, Hourly gave all her poison to afflict thee With discontent, and foul suspicion Of thy best friends. Then Hume, the calm historian, Somewhat, perhaps, ironical and heartless, Rous'd thy mad jealousy and deep revenge; Then Walpole's poignant wit thy vanity And self-esteem too cruelly assaulted. In the delightful solitude of Stafford's Peace-breathing woodlands, with thy flowers and garden, A guest, with all thy wants provided for, Thou might'st have been serenely happy, had The friend attendant on thee pour'd the balm Of comfort on thy troubled nerves and heart! But ever did she fan thy brooding cares, And jaundic'd disbelief; and thou returnedst Insanely tortur'd from a kind asylum. But never on thy natal spot, belov'd With intermingled passions of resentment And indignation, to take up thy residence! For as we love, we hate; and as no other Scenes the same keen delight can give us, none Can the same pains and agonies inflict! Few were the years that after thy return Thou lingerd'st out thy melancholy life; And, as 'tis said, at last by thine own hand Clos'd it.—It is a strange mysterious tale; But horror at the base and faithless conduct Of her, who was the scourge of thy existence, Rumour assigns the cause: and I have heard From those who've seen the model of thy skull, The bullet mark is there. Thy fame was high, But never could it satisfy the craving Of thy vain appetite: or morbid humour Made thee insensible to its extent. 'Tis strange, that Nature should endow a few With such superiority of genius, That they should overcome the rivalry Of ages; and contending still against Novelty, fashion, labour, art, and aid Of the light of high minds preceding them, Should still hold onward their eclipsing course. How can it be that those high-gifted beings Can so much life upon their pages throw? Well has De Staël, in her most early effort At literary fame, evolv'd thy character! High-mounted, in Lausanne's vicinity, Stands Aubonne! There Tavernier from his travels Rested,—a chosen spot, adapted well T' his Oriental taste, where fortune's favour Crown'd him with wealth: but Riches, it is said, Have wings and fly away; and so with him! And after all his luxuries, necessity Drove him to his old occupations. Hast thou not heard of Vevay? Every Briton Has heard of Vevay, where in the dust the relics Slumber of England's stern republican, Ludlow! In this delightful spot he spent His latter lonely days, when Charles return'd! Not idle, but still weaving well his daily Task, the yet valued tale of history! There the Lake winds, and cross its waves are seen At distance the precipitous heights wood-crownd Of fam'd La Meillerai! of which when lovers Read, they all tremble, as at Rimini Dante the tale of the unhappy Pair Relates, where fatal was the book to both! At the Lake's head we cross'd the marshy grounds By Villeneuve: and then enter'd on the route From Italy by Vallais! where we fell On Savoy's ancient territories,—Savoy Ever from its first origin despotic, Ambitious, self-aggrandising, and reckless Of right; ferocious to Genevan freedom; And still its ancient claims by ruse and arms Not utterly abandoning; but worn At last with age, and sinking into feebleness, And now its chiefs expir'd; but its crown fallen Into the hands of a more vigorous scion. Then come we to Ripaille, in history noted For the Count-Pope and his retirement thither, When Rome's proud mitre was surrender'd by him: But on the tale my Muse refrains to enter, Touch'd by Voltaire, the world's great favourite. Here agriculture flourishes in Chablais; But hardly live the peasantry, and hard Their wrinkled visages, and spare tall figures; And by the iron rod of bigot power, Priest-ridden, are they cruelly oppress'd! And now thro Cologny we pass again, And once more Byron's residence salute. Was he more happy in these scenes of grandeur, With lakes and mountains, such as in his childhood Fed his romantic fancy, than in scenes Of Italy; Venice, Ravenna, Pisa Perchance less stirring to imagination? O no! the struggles of a firey heart, Yet tender;—of high hopes of love, ambition, Friendship, respect, esteem, at once destroy'd, Were here in their first agonies: the tempest Allow'd but briefest intervals of peace. But as the sorrow and the indignation Were strong, so was the brilliance of the mind: The Bard perhaps did never more intensely Feel, and more powerfully describe, than now. Here Manfred he conceiv'd amid the rocks And crags of Chamouni; and sure than Manfred His Muse a nobler poem ne'er produc'd! New images, new sentiments, a tone Of sad mysterious rhythmical melody, Softness, sublimity, and altogether A magic inspiration; to himself Peculiar;—which in every word is Byron,— Byron;—and no one else—to every one's Perception, only Byron! when from the height, The giddy height seductive of destruction Manfred descends, we shudder at each step, And follow him with breathless agitation. There are who call the mighty bard a borrower! Let the dull censurer ponder on those strains! But not for ever on a favourite poet Must I prolong my verse monotonous! Eaux-Vives! I now return to you! To see The white sail of the barge in glimmering distance O'er the blue waters gaining on the eye! And watch the tide dashing against thy walls, And listen to its melancholy murmurs. But now my boiling blood, by solar heats Reflected from the glassy surface, when At the oar labouring;—while the treacherous blast Bred in the mountains, like a thief in th' night, Cross the luxurious moment of suspence,— Arrests my intellectual purposes. But still Romance, and theories abstruse Of dry hard arithmetical researches Into the causes by which nations flourish In wealth material, by alternate mixture Relieve each other, and by resolution Two tasks I close;—thus, Coningsby, to thee I give th'approaching crisis; and thus end A weightier labour, on the Population Of Kingdoms, and how far increase contributes To happiness, and strength! Now twelve long years Want but a month or two to be completed, Since thus I felt, and spoke, and acted. Time Has since gone fertile in events and thoughts; But ever on myself I must not dwell. Geneva! though thine idol has been liberty, Too often hast thou felt the hand of Power, And long and various have thy troubles been Between obedience and command. Thy people Have ever rife and stirring at resistance Been; discontented, giving little faith To those who ruled them, and suspicious ever Of usurpation of unnecessary Force, and a wanton exercise of proud Authority! and many a harrowing tale Of punishment and death in the resistance Fills your impressive annals! does there live The heart that will not weep at Fatio's death? There was a fierce relentless cruelty In it, which never yet distain'd the power Of monarchs! He, condemn'd to death for acts Of politic resistance, doubtfully Construed as crimes of treason to the state, Remanded back to prison, the next morning Was call'd into the court, and coolly shot In presence of the Syndics. At the notice He stood undaunted, calmly from his cell Came forth, and with heroic firmness met His cruel fate! Thus faction was repress'd, If it was faction: but a small Republic, With powers that from their origin were never Defin'd precisely, might admit in candour The difference of opinion in strong minds, Well educated, and of probity Unquestion'd; and if punishment was necessary To keep the bonds over a restless people; Not death! But death the despot bigot Calvin Had taught, a century and half before, Was due to those who differ'd from their rulers E'en in the theory of points abstruse. O Servet! thy recording spirit tells A bosom-rending story, which the fame Of Calvin never can wipe out! Thyself, Didst thou not, as a leader of the Church Reform'd, claim freedom from Rome's dogmatism? And why was difference from thee to draw The forfeiture of life? Burnt at the stake! O horrible beyond all other cruelties! “Blood only may be spilt for blood!” says Burke: And I would willingly thou shouldst have died, As thou hadst made thine enemy to die! Thou wast a bigoted enthusiast, And if a stern corrector of foul manners Thou wast, I much suspect it was a mode To feed thy love of power and vanity;— Not from pure virtue! How could virtue prompt, Nay how could it consent to such a deed, As Servet's death? Was it to be found In dictates of that Gospel, which thou boastedst Thine only guide to be? What charity, If in the heart it is not, can in essence Belong to him who most pretends to piety? And without charity what true religion? O Calvin, in the strange dominion given Thro' Europe to thy doctrines, mingled evil Disturb'd all ancient policies and powers. Thence came the surly hypocritic Puritan, Fierce as Rome's faction, and not less intriguing. Thus Tudor's wise and most magnanimous princess Spent her last days 'tween two devouring fires! Then vulgar insolence and most nonsensical Rejection of all ornament,—the spoiler Of all that wak'd devotion thro' the fancy, Of imagery grand, or fair, or passionate, Went forth, and with the texts of scripture ever Distorted, misapplied, and ignorantly Construed, upon his lips, but to his heart Never in due streams reaching, overturn'd Sincerity, and natural impulses, And probity of conscience, and good faith In conduct, labouring like moles At mischief under ground; and sowing seeds, That in explosion of all civil policy Might one day end. But, eloquent Hooker, thou Wert the firm prop to the true church: thy labours In wisdom, argument, and powerful language, Yet flourish green! From very childhood I With reverence pass'd thy simple parsonage In the sweet vale where Barham's Roman way Ever attracts th'historic traveller. And thy remaining monument inscrib'd By the time-honour'd name of Cowper's sires! But I have reach'd the close of the division, That order to my tedious song prescribes. BOOK V. It is the nineteenth morning since I first Begun the strain on thee, beloved Lake! And yet my daily task has been unbroken! Thus perseverance has its own reward! We know not what we can do till we try! Much of the dead my strains have dwelt upon; Naught of the living! First of thee, the friend Of the great lyric bard whom first I lov'd, And who still holds unchang'd my adoration, Of moral Gray;—Bonstetten,—in thine age Who the vivacity of youth retainest! Scholar, philosopher, “of imagination Compact” of multifarious knowledge pregnant;— And thou, in deep political knowledge wise, And statist admirable, D'Ivernois, Whose friendship and attention in my days Of long long sickness ne'er have been relax'd; And classical Prevost, in philosophic Lore not less fam'd; and thou, profound Sismondi, Of European fame; historian, critic, Liberty's great defender; philosophic And eloquent narrator of the days Of Italy's free and resplendent glories, Who now the tale of France in copious volumes Unfoldest; and thou, traveller, whose pages Piquant, sagacious, brief, original, Just, ever win attention, caustic Simond! And thou last annalist of thy native land Of lakes and mountains, Picot! and thou, Fazy, Fam'd for thy eloquence in senate, wise In that profound economy, on which Depends the people's happiness, with heart Devoted to their good!—and Coindet, thou, To whose rich stores and generous openness, Whate'er of curious note I have recorded, Is due; and Maunoir, thou of mark'd vivacity, And spiritual genius! and ye, learned jurists, Rossi and Bellot! and thou last, not least, In friendship and in hospitality Warmest,—renown'd upon the private stage,— The oracle, thro whose lips miraculous Shakespeare Speaks;—Lullin, whose most ancient name is trac'd Thro all the annals of Genevan story, From its first Counts, before the House of Savoy Oppress'd them, and extinguish'd! Of thy fame, De Candolle, I am little qualified To speak, for, I alas! am ignorant Of that sweet science, of which thou dost shine Preeminent thro Europe! but thy pen, Eloquent, searching, and profound in tracing Resemblances and variations in The forms and features of humanity, In various climes and nations, I can follow With admiration and delight! Ah, some, Of name renown'd, whom I have known, are gone, But ripe in honours, to their quiet graves! Pictet, in philosophic searches vers'd, And his more various-minded Brother; critic, Political economist, in agriculture Practical, and as theorist, renown'd! And thou too, latest lost, by all lamented, Piercing and clear Dumont: though I protest Against thy doctrines of political Impossibility, more plausible Than with man's passionate nature practical. But here I must repeat the wonder, that No poets in this ample list are found! A cause there must be in the history Of mind for this, although unknown to me! What scenery more suited to a poet? Then is it in the climate? It cannot Rise from hereditary disposition, Because Genevan families are sprung From mingled nations! As the poet's power Lies in the mind, not matter, it would seem Of climates and of countries independent: But with the organs of the brain depress'd, Derang'd, diseas'd, perchance imagination Can only act imperfectly! alas, We search in vain in these mysterious shrines; We have no eye can penetrate them clearly: There may be sensibility extreme In th'heart: and yet the fancy, and still more Th'inventive faculty, may be deficient. Beings constructed thus can be affected By strains pathetic; but to the creation Of imagery, and visions of ideal Magnificence, be quite unapprehensive, And moved still less! To them the voice of poetry Is but an idle sound! Let them pass by The lyre, and shut their ears, and close their hearts! I cannot envy them! They may be pitied: But would do well to moderate their scorn! It is the scorn of dulness, which affects Contempt for what it cannot understand! We hear there is no wisdom but in logic: Then Providence has given us no intuitive Knowledge, and nothing sound we can arrive at, Except by chains of single steps;—thus slow Our wisdom must advance; but in a blaze Imagination her intelligence Gives; and we see not single points, but all At once, living and dead, matter and mind, Coalescing, or conflicting, or in labour By separate paths and instruments to reach One end. And thus she sees what passion prompts, What conscience dictates: the two springs of action; Which reason vainly struggles to presage. And thus it is we from the Muse must learn Our most sagacious lessons of mankind. O blind and foolish, who affect to scorn The Muse! Without her what were all, that gladdens The higher qualities of our existence? All that delights in nature's scenery comes From her! All sentiment, all elevation Of thought; all that enchants in female beauty; All that inspires the ear in harmony Of voices, and of instruments, and sounds Breath'd by the elements; or from the woods; From herds and flocks in meadows or on plains, From ocean's billows; or from mountain torrents, Or gentle murmuring streams. In the first dawn Awaking, 'tis imagination's light That beams the hopes of coming day before us. When we return at eve, fatigued with labour, Imagination paints the joys of rest! And when we would look back in meditation To see life in its brilliant tints reviv'd, It is alone upon the Muse's volume We turn to find it duly animated! There goes the touch of magic to the heart, And secret springs are mov'd; and to the fancy Blaze all at once the past, the present, future, Uniting in one picture to the eye, With life more brilliant than reality! Then we forget our mortal ligaments, And for a moment are all spiritualiz'd. Who will not find in Shakespeare wiser axioms, Lore more adapted to men's hearts and business, Than in all volumes of philosophers Collected into one? Who will not find, In Milton more reveal'd divinity, Than in the pages of the theologians? There holy inspiration: there the moral Severe, profound, and pure, and comprehensive In the elucidation of Man's nature! There Davenant, of the Epic laurel wreath Most worthy, ill rewarded, most unjustly Neglected and forgotten, tells his tale, Enrich'd at every incident with lore Moral and intellectual in abundance, Express'd with nervous brevity and clearness, Pure, elegant, harmonious, pointed, noble! There Spenser pours his endless imagery Of moral allegory, where the chivalrous Figures, and gorgeous fictions of enchantment, Almost o'ercome the senses! but beneath Those veils is couch'd the whole philosophy Of moral truths; and never can the study Exhausted be! Thus Bards of ancient date Most dealt in ethic doctrines. O lov'd Cowley, Whose bosom was a limpid spring of purity, Of flowers from woods and meadows, violets And primroses, of sentiment as virtuous As the sweet sylvan solitude thou lov'dst! In thy enchanting language is reflected The image of an heart by genius warm'd, By learning strengthen'd, by a virtuous conscience Directed, beaming with benevolence, And cheerful rays of natural simplicity! Then comes the comic Hudibras, of wit And learning mingled into essences;— Whose golden ore, where'er we search, is found, And forms a coin to pass throughout the world, Among the wise:—still the collision sparkles And strikes a light, wherever it conflicts: Nor Denham is in thee the moral lore Wanting: the couplet strong, concise, with thought Weighty, in strain harmonious pours along! Thy heart, perchance, was sensitive and morbid, And thou couldst not the wandring levities Bear of thy young fair wife amid a court Luxurious, profligate; of others reckless, And harden'd to th'effects of the worst injury, Man to break up the social ties indulges. Then did that genius, which light minds believ'd To be a dreamer lost in reveries, Begin to wander from its bounds, and grief And jealousy with strange chaotic visitings Disturb'd thy brain, and thou didst wildly wander A maniac! And yet did no compunction Touch the fair bosom of that fallen Beauty, Whose noble blood, the relic of an House Of ancient Barons, then by James's tyranny, And basest thirst of lucre, sunk in ruin, Had in her more exalted feelings planted! Alas! for beauty in a sensual Court Poison'd, there is no herb to cleanse the stain! After long interval came Prior's Muse, Whose Song of Solomon, now little read, Will be immortal; while on the sweet tale Of Henry and of Emma every lover Will hang with ears enraptur'd, in despite Of Johnson's cold and tasteless criticism. Of Dryden I have sung before, and here Will not repeat a judgment trite and stale. Nor aught of thee, of harmony the chief, Sage Pope! Then came a fashion new, and imagery Alone was deem'd worthy the Muse's praise. Thus Thomson won his laurels, well-deserv'd! But that which teaches how our intellectual Being to manage, is the wisdom prime! All imagery is only from material Existence drawn. Enough of poets here! There is a subject, which at the perilous crisis We live in, rages more. It is the fate Political of nations: but I'll away with't: It is too grave for pleasure; and too big Perchance in its results for human wisdom! Great poets have in perilous crises liv'd, Yet have not sung the less. Thus Buckhurst, Milton! But I, the humblest of the humble, have not The magnanimity to persevere, If that dread topic is not kept aloof! Does fame add to our happiness?—The preacher Tells us that all is vanity. Cool thought Agrees not with him:—but it is a fame Stedfast which is not empty: when it fluctuates, The ebb gives more of pain, than the flow, pleasure. Thus Mason felt, when he grew out of fashion: Humour and spleen o'erwhelm'd him. Hayley, by fate Not less depressive follow'd, kept his cheerfulness, And warm benevolence of heart. To him Not of the poet's faculties inventive Nature had been profuse; but of a mind Gentle, and elegant, of taste chastised, Rich in accomplishments in literature, And full of tender moral sentiment: Yet not profound; and too inclin'd to trust To borrow'd stores: a fault less oft occurring Perchance to Britain, than to other nations. The searching air of Leman's lake should well Stir the original spirits of the mind; But yet it is not here;—it is not here,— That the fresh fountains of unaided thought, And powers divine of bright imagination Have been bestow'd, or have themselves unfolded, With that one grand exception, eloquent Intense Rousseau! for not to thee, De Stael The fate was given to be born or bred Upon the Lake: nor hadst thou powers inventive In high degree; but rather force, acuteness, Sagacity, and fine discrimination. To theologic lore Geneva once Her mental toils applied, voluminous And cumbersome:—tomes now upon the shelf Sleeping in dust: the Diodatis, Pictets, Turrettini's, Lullin's, thus! But Godefroy, jurist, Lives to this day in memory of the learned! Philosophy and Science, O Geneva, Were ever thy prime favourites! De Saussure, Geologist thro' Europe known, and Bonnet, And thou still living ornament, De Candolle! Then Casaubon, in classic lore profound;— Greek, above all! Nor ought I thee to pass, In natural history vers'd, biographer Of thy fam'd city's literary toils, And critic most industrious, Senebier! Withdraw the veil from Time; trace back the ways That he has pass'd; and read upon these tracks The marks, the cyphers, and the mysteries Inscribed in a thousand characters! It is an edifying lesson,—mix'd Too oft with crimes, and causes of regret, And seeds of future evil.—On, the world, With all the faults of governments, has gone Hitherto! But it seems as if a crisis Approaches near, when it will go no longer! Then anarchy will come; and dogs of Ruin Will be let loose to prey upon the world! Where'er assembled mobs will rule, there can be Nothing but devastation, famine, death! All civil policy may be abus'd; But without government men are wild beasts. I would have power and authority Forever watch'd with lynx-ey'd force and courage! But not destroy'd!—Reform; but not destruction;— Is the wise freeman's object! Laws abus'd Are a most terrible pestilence: but lawless Savages are yet worse! Let Ruin come, As on the fall of the great Roman Empire, And those dark ages which ensued, as nothing Compar'd with those which now the world will cover, Hereafter will appear! a poison bitterer, And far more virulent, has been infus'd! O! one false step of one weak man sometimes Leads to the world's deep woe for generations! Who caus'd America's rebellion, nearly Seventy conflicting years of anger past? Who by a word scarce thirty months ago Stirr'd up the tempest brooding now o'er England? Who by mad ordinances madly plann'd, And weakly executed, at a blow Level'd a dynasty of a thousand years; And made a flourishing nation, with new being Just mounting to unheard prosperity, To tremble on a mine of utter ruin? Herds of barbarians from the north will come; And utter devastation prostrate all! Where codes of law are fighting for, there soon Will be no law at all! tho law itself, When it is bad, is worse perchance than none! If Providence permits this globe of habitants, Condemn'd to sin from Adam, to go on, From the tremendous downfall, which the threat, Of civil policy o'erthrown must bring. Brute force will lord it o'er the world again, And tyrants new will power despotic win By the blood-thirsty sword! then by degrees Arts, learning, laws, and wisdom's institutions, Will recommence! but centuries will pass, Ere they will reach again the happy point, From which they will have fallen! There is a time, When rage, and something like insanity, Infects mankind! and such, perhaps, the day We live in! while th'aspiring men, who love Power with a bigoted idolatry, Outrage the true defenders of the bonds, Of absolute necessity to hold Society together. Let not monarchs, If they do not promote the general happiness, Rule for a day!—But, under due restraint, I do believe a monarchy the best For the general welfare! power will be corrupt Always,—whatever be its form—or kingly, Or oligarcic, or republican! And ever ought by counterbalancing Poises to be controul'd! th'elite among The people, rais'd by education, wealth, Talent, and character, should have a strong Opposing weight on every government, Sufficient to restrain it in its course, But not to check and paralyse its motions! A prurience of change; a wilful crossing Of mild authority; a constant cavil At laws by custom render'd venerable, And easily and contentedly coercive, Is folly and vain shallow self-sufficiency, Not to be pardon'd! Subtle theory Against experience is the Paradise Of fools! When practice shews itself by facts Of ill productive, then to theory We must resort, new measures to devise;— And he who reasons best, and can propose With most sagacity, deserves the wreath! But custom is a bond less easily broken Than legislative chains, and far less galling! The old irregular mansion of our infancy Is more delightful than a new-built palace! Security, bought at the cost of guards Still greater than the worth of what's secur'd, Is a strange insult upon human intellect: And legislation, which will interfere To thwart, not forward, the productive labours Of man's devises, arts, must be cur'd by force, If reason will not be attended to!— Foolish, base-hearted, most contemptible, And odious optimists,—who think that power Ever must be i'th' right! when power in truth Forever tends to wrong, if 't be not bound In chains of iron! Wisdom is the child Of Genius, and of Virtue, nurs'd by Toil! And statesmen are not always wise, nor have Talent, or conscience! They are mainly men Uplifted by intrigue, or accident, Or hard, dull, unimpressible audacity! Unswerving, positive, direct, because No other light except their own they see! Palpable truths they miss; and dwell upon Mysterious errors, since the artifice Excites what the simplicity of wisdom Cannot affect! Thus if there be a falsehood As gross, as it is mischievous, their bigotry In their heart holds it never to be mov'd, While all which ought to be for granted taken, They name it prejudice to save from doubt! Thus on they go;—and thus the part they play, For anarchists their projects to pursue! In Britain's empire thus the fatal quarter Of an whole century has pass'd away; Yet almost all has error been, and blindness, And feebleness of intellect, and worst, Most mischievous of all, sad, pusillanimous, And selfish vacillation! Even wrong, Firmly pursued, may by bold accident Attain its ends! but vacillation never!— It is the chasing of a feeble light, That glimmers now on this side, now on that, Now in the centre;—and invites annoyance! It will be ask'd, where then was Canning's splendor Of intellect, and magnanimity Of resolution? But his course of rule Was short, ere Death o'ertook him, and his plans Not yet develop'd for a proper judgment Of their effects, or their prospective wisdom; And when he clos'd his eyes, a mighty darkness Came o'er the nation! What has since occurr'd, Has, much of it, fall'n on strange governors, Full of alternate rashness and concession, Whence evils are yet in their cradle, which Shall soon convulse the world, and shake, perhaps, The constitution of six hundred years To atoms.—Much it wanted of repair: But those repairs were far too long defer'd, And crowds of speculative jobbers force Their services to pull the building down, And utterly rebuild it to their own Wild fancies: and it is most probable, Rebuilt it will be, to appease the craving Appetites of their measureless ambition. Then down will come the ancient towers and spires, To the clouds reaching; and th'irregular But not incongruous diversities, Plann'd by a long succession of wise ages, As time and fit occasion dictated, And as experience gave the certain lesson Of the necessity; but now, if built After the fashion of the crotchet-mongers, 'Twill be, perhaps, but as a citizen's box,— Dwarfs, lions, monsters, serpents, wolves, and bears! Thus in opinion, not in imagery, For many a page have I my stores pour'd out; And there are critics, who with obstinacy Swear that in imagery alone is poetry Of the true fountain to be found. Such narrow Notions, which little of poetic vein Would leave in greatest poets, merit not Response. All of high wisdom is for poetry Matter the most profound and valuable. We cannot think with power and force and clearness, Unless imagination the materials Presents: and thus from lofty, burning, views Results sublimity of thought and feeling: Poetry is no gewgaw, or mere plaything! Let them who read not for the intellect, To gingling rhymes, or monstrous visions go! To teach us how to think is the prime lesson, And how to feel! For whence draw we our honey, When like the bee we would extract the sweets From flowers of poetry? The moral axiom, The sentiment we sieze upon; not images Glaring, and gorgeous; monsters, mysteries! Of Shakespeare's strains divine whence do we take The passages for ever on our lips? All that relates to simple daily movements Of human bosoms! of opinion's stores And of the colours of our common life! Who lives among the mountains and the lakes, Has his heart warm'd, and intellect exalted, E'en tho' his lips are silent, and in outward Shape he may rude and barbarous appear. The eye cannot survey grandeur of matter, And be unmov'd! And strong variety Of shadowing tints, changing and beautiful, Affects the labourer at his daily work, And fills his breast with cheerful energy! A flat dull atmosphere, impending over A flat dull country, undiversified, Depresses deep the spirit, and of hope Clouds all the rays: and hope alone can lead us Along beneath life's ever-pressing burden! It is variety that freshens us; And there is no variety but in hope! All is in mind: we have no real joy But in the mind! and matter pleases only, As it is clad and tinted by the mind. And thus it is, that poets give the energy, And sole attraction to all human things! For they with thought and sentiment array them, And this is the association, which Makes the creative essence of true poetry. There is, perhaps, a discipline of brain, Which tends not to unite but separate, These thoughts and feelings, miscall'd adventitious; And this they may deem science;—sound philosophy Worthy their toils; and forasmuch as fashion Governs mankind too much; and this the fashion That has upon the banks of Leman's Lake Prevail'd for ages; it may be the cause That poetry has never flourish'd here; Where nature gave the scenes most fit to nurse it! Old stern ascetic Calvin, to the Muses Odious, and hating them as wicked Syrens, His distillations of sour antidotes Spread far and wide and deep;—from which the blood May ne'er be purified. Enthusiasm;— Yet no imagination, and no sentiment:— Strange contradiction!—Narrowness, and bigotry, And puritanism in its odious sense! Delusions! Are the joys of life delusions?— They are realities:—and innocent, And virtuous realities: to fright them, And hue and cry them off is flagrant crime! Why not deal with them in the scenes, where nature Has been profuse of her magnificence? Are they nip'd in the bud? Is every nascent Idea, and emotion, crush'd at once;— And then the channels of the heart and brain Clos'd; and a formal artificial character Of intellect forc'd rudely in its place? A poet is a gardener, who sows flowers, Balm, and herbs medicinal, and lays out The ground in lawns, and woods, and lakes, and forests, And murmuring rills, and tumbling roaring torrents! And is his art, and labour, valueless, And trifling, and insipid? 'Tis the spell That makes the blood to flow in kindling tides, And turns the drink of life into pure nectar! We are whate'er we think ourselves; and all Of our existence is imagination: Tear but the veil; and all beneath is hideous. There's no such thing as metaphysical: Matter and mind must always go together, In the mysterious lot of this strange life!— But Mind will turn the matter into spiritual, If duly nurs'd! and all will take the colours And essences of intellectual Existence.—By due force of mind, and will, We can controul and new direct our passions, And almost overcome their human grossness; And the mean, selfish passions, which most rule us At first, may be most perfectly subdued. First in the infant, jealousy appears Raging beyond controul: then anger fierce, And vengeance hot or sullen, wearing off Quick, or in moody meditation nurs'd: Then cunning, falsehood, fraud, and selfish arts, And sensual appetites, and craving avarice, And mingled most with virtue, love of fame, Generous often, sometimes noble,—sometimes Mean, criminal, or childish and absurd. For some will win distinction at the cost Of vice outrageous; or by wearing caps Of bells from folly borrow'd.—Only Genius, To Virtue wedded, can be great on earth! And where no wisdom is, there is no genius; And where no virtue, neither is there wisdom! What is not virtuous, never can be wise; For without virtue is no happiness: And what is wisdom, but to know the way Happiness to attain? Regret pursues All evil; and thus counteracts enjoyment, Which for a moment may from Vice be drawn. All high exertion of the mental powers, Not in the cause of Vice, is in itself Pleasure intense. Thus Dante, Petrarch, Milton, Tasso, and Spenser, and unrival'd Shakespeare, Must have enjoy'd at times excess of rapture, Inferior mortals cannot e'en conceive! The powers of mind, by nature's boon profusely Bestow'd, expand by exercise and nurture, To an excess no thought anticipates; And with the impulse of true inspiration Out of themselves into another being Are borne! With them we may converse with awe; And listen, as to oracles: their lore Is breath'd from higher regions: in the night Spirits descend upon their eyelids, or Come whispering on the breeze; or in the rays Of the sweet silvery moonlight dance and sing. Thus are the streams of their own knowledge fed; And when they ope the fountains of their hearts, A radiance bursts, as when the sun at once Darts from some massy cloud; and fragrance rises, And notes of tender music issue forth. Then comes a wild delirium o'er the faculties, And bosom of high-chorded sensibility. But with the earth, as with the floating music That travels in the air, they have choice converse. Into the secret temple of men's hearts They enter; and draw thence upon the glass Of their own fancies all the tender movements, Of which the pictures can instruct or please. Thousands there are of noble bosoms, which Are agitated by sublime emotions, Or tenderness most exquisite and pure: Yet are not gifted with the art to paint them, And others' sympathy to exercise. These call the magic accents of the bard, The glories of their bosoms to communicate. O literature! to thee alone we owe, That by th'accumulated stores of wisdom, Time and experience gather, we can profit! Except for thee, each age for self alone Had lived! and each successive generation Had to renew its same experiments. Now what our grandsires thought and felt in æras, And manners widely different from our own, We have before us, for comparison, In animated colours! Thus we see, That genius ever thinks and feels the same. Hither, the Reformation's capital, Came many a fugitive from the fire and stake, When Mary Tudor, the ferocious child Of the eighth Harry, mounted England's throne, And the angelic Jane, the victim daughter Of ducal Suffolk, on the scaffold paid The forfeit of her life, to feed th'ambition Of those from whom she drew her hapless being. O lively, learned, innocent, and pious, Simple, and wise! the tears forever flow Of all posterity upon thy fate! But thy heart-breaking tale is too well known; And yet too long to be repeated here! Here daring Knox, intemperate and brutal, Ferocious foe of Caledonia's beauty, Mary, of Stuart's race, his anti-popery Cherish'd and spread; and puritanic hatred To power monarchic loudly bellow'd out. Here Whittingham, whom after his return Rich Durham for its northern deanery own'd, And whom the Psalms acknowledge for a versifier, Rested four years from persecution's fangs. Here lies the book! the archives of the State Retain it still, which they deliver'd up, When they took leave in native soils to seek Their residence: the annals of their birth Their marriages, and deaths! The future dean His nuptials here with his French wife contracted. O silent Night, beneath thy mantle lives Calm Contemplation in her happiest mood!— Then busy Interruption sleeps; and all The restless passions of mankind are still. In the turmoil of human converse never The Muse her stream with force and frankness gives: We cannot mingle with the world, and have Our tempers and our feelings undisturb'd. And under irritation the weak hand Can from the lyre no sounds of harmony draw. There are who think, the products of the mind, Being unembodied, are but useless shadows: “Act; do not talk or write,” they cry,—“for words Are but the hollow whistling of the wind!” To brutal exhortations, such as these, There is no answer but indignant scorn: And when the mind is high, the human station May be—among the lowest,—not debased. The mind is acting on the face of things, And still directs their movements, and their colours; Tho' unperceiv'd: and wide Opinion spreads Her influence, when the current glides along Viewless. It is opinion, sentiment, Not reason, guides the world. The head alone, Without the heart's assent, will do but little: Dry arguments fall dead upon the hearer, And are forgotten. Bulky folios Of artificial, temporary, inferences, In every age are printed, reign a little while, And then are cast away as worthless waste: The natural effusions of pure genius Live, and are green for ever. The mind wanders, Rich in the blessing of ubiquity; And casts her piercing gleams throughout all space. But in strange days we live, and it may be Permitted for a time that mere brute force Should rule;—if mind her just dominion yield By false assent. In all past ages, mind, In every nation, civilised or barbarous, Has heretofore been governor, and will Again, tho' for a moment bodily Strength should o'ercome! Mankind cannot be made Anew, after the lapse of many thousands Of years: the principle innate of power, And of obedience, will be still the same: And the same course will be again to run From savageness to polish, and the arts. First will the sword, and cruel tyranny, Prevail; then civil government, and laws, And sway, by wisdom and refinement soften'd; Mingled, perchance, with humour and corruption: And often needing the opposing hand Of those submitted to the harsh misrule. But not to call the people for a lasting Instrument of controul, if it be true That man by reason and by conscience cannot Govern himself, but wants the force of laws, And power, his passions and desires to bind, And hold his hands from injuring another. No power not strictly necessary is Endurable in monarchs, oligarchs;— And surely least of all in strict republics. Who ever but an ideot dream'd, that monarchs Had power bestow'd for their own gratification? Where will the silly optimist be found, Who gives his faith, that power will not abuse Its franchises and functions, when it dares? It is the duty of a citizen, All necessary puissance to uphold;— But all beyond, with arm magnanimous, And voice untrembling firmly to resist; To put to scorn the insolence of office, Nor fear the field of battle, nor the scaffold. Wisdom in council is a quality Not to be spar'd in those, who would aspire Duties of state to execute; and weakness Is a crime worthy of a mighty vengeance, To those who undertake the perilous labours They are unfitted to perform with talent. And is then legislation a light duty? If it be light, why have such grievous errors Disgrac'd our statute-books, and brought destruction, Fire, famine, blood, on a misgovern'd people? Is it enough to vote, and not to judge, To think, discriminate, suggest, invent, With moral principles be well imbued, To know the heart of man, and all his passions, And modulate provisions to his nature? In the last stage of a declining State, When luxury, and rank corruption, spread Their poisons o'er the land, and to the heart-strings, When all is deep and complex artifice, And evil is immix'd indissolubly With every institution, not a step, But by profound sagacity, can be taken Safely. Then minds unexercis'd, unaided By wisdom's stores, and how much more if weak In native faculties, must fail to do The work of difficulty put upon them! 'Tis said, they can but go with leading heads, And rule by numbers!—but where is the judgment To fix upon the leader? and is all To rest upon the shoulders, and the talents, And probity of one or two alone? 'Tis by the conflict of commanding intellects, Affairs of state are managed with due wisdom: And intellect is now almost extinct In legislators, and in politicians: In Britain almost of the last was Canning!— A man of florid rhetoric,—of heart Bold and decisive;—not of primal genius, Or most profound and most sagacious judgment; Versatile, proud, ambitious, vain! “Who bore No rival brother near the throne!”—but cross'd By politics perverse, and taunting bigotry; And when his light was out, no other lamp To guide us thro the darkness of the world, Where tempests were in every quarter brooding. Then sunk we all at once a thousand fathom Deep in all Europe's eyes! The warrior bold Lost in the cabinet his irresistible Decision; and in wavering feebleness, Now arbitrary recklessly, now yielding When all the policy was in resistance, The country to the brink of ruin brought, From which, perchance, it cannot now be sav'd. It was, when Freedom, e'en to licence, was A crying rage, most grievously ill-tim'd By military tactics to endeavour A liberal people to be ruler over! And by his fiat to expect to carry Each measure,—scorning ever to give reasons! Instructing all his myrmidons to laugh At eloquence and argument, as wind! “To act, and not to talk” was the fool's taunt: And weak, forsooth, and blindfold, was each act! Yet not the less insulting!—If we now Are in a dangerous experiment Engag'd, to him we owe it!—Naught remain'd But the essay to make: there was no choice, And the least evil only could be taken! Peril is clamour'd by the Tory bigot! In what state-crisis is not peril ever? But we must balance perils!—Reason here Had a resistless force:—not mob-like passion; And senseless cry of discontented labour! Time generates corruptions, which calm reason Must not be hard and idle to correct! Lightly to change an ancient institution, Is a vile treason against sense and rights. But 'tis the bigotry of fools to hold To their abuses: and to never bend To circumstances, and to change of seasons! A poise between the people and the crown Is the best project of a government: But much that poise is weaken'd, if it holds Means for monopoly in Honour's market, And thus the state's high functions can extort. Then, to the crown and people equally faithless, A fungus of corruption it becomes; And irritates revenge, and nurses up Thoughts of destruction in its adversaries: And mingles with the body, which should be Of pure aristocratic elements Compos'd, the fruits of base dishonest lucre, And new nobility by riches purchas'd: And against new nobility the people By natural impulse turn! Stern Johnson ask'd if ever politics Disturb'd one's rest? He liv'd in days far other Than these, in which we ever tread on mines! Then Governments had only once in centuries Been to the bottom ras'd! Now all is trembling,— Shook to its basis! But too long it suits not To linger on one note! Helvetia's mountains Avoided not the shock of civil discord: Nor ever can they safe and tranquil be, If the flame shall be put in blaze again; And much the sparks we see, as of Vesuvius, Before some grand irruption: horrific rumbles Groan from within; and the dread crater opens! Nature alone is beautiful, and grand, And good. Man ever is disturb'd by evil And death-pursuing passions.—Governments Too often have been held as individual Property. Thus too many ages felt The Pays de Vaud the iron rod of Savoy: And beautiful Lausanne her fate submitted To the congenial spirit of the Mitre: While Chablais never yet has shaken off The ancient yoke of Savoy and of Maurienne: A race that by its gradual accretions, In eight long ever restless centuries, From a small rill swell'd to a mighty river; And enter'd deep upon Helvetia's borders, And France confronted, thus a slice from Burgundy Dividing, while the walls of the diminutive, But most magnanimous Geneva, kept At bold defiance their assaults delusive. Then Austria in Helvetia's northern districts Its origin Hapsburgian ne'er forgot, And ever had its eye, and its ambitions, Upon its cradle; or at least the cradle Of 'its extinguish'd dynasty of males; For tis not true, Lorraine's more ancient house Sprung from the same male stock: its origin, Of the imperial line of old Franconia, Ascends to loftier honours in the night Of time,—tho hitherto untrac'd by all Its proper genealogists; and least By Calmet, whose most erudite and toilsome Fame was ill merited in this due task. But still the force puissant of the house Rules o'er the Tyrol, and, with black outspread Wings, on the skirts of the free Cantons hangs! Once this great empire, the asserted heritage Of mighty Charlemagne, or rather of Old Rome's imperial purple, bow'd e'en low To th'ground beneath Napoleon's conquering sword, And irresistible ambition: But it has risen again, and, like a giant, With strength refresh'd!—and now no symptom gives Of age, or of decay: while other empires And kingdoms all are trembling. Is it wisdom, Or policy, or courage, or heroic Usage of arms? Or better, readier, skill In statesmanlike financial economy, Or in commercial enterprise and wealth? Or in the laws to make a people happy, And strong in body and in mental courage? Ah! surely not the latter! and for artifice, If it succeeds a little while, it never Lasts when the habit of deceit is known. It will be still the rallying point of Europe: But, like the rest, at length perchance will crumble To dust. Ere half a century is gone, The world again may into massy darkness And utter ruin fall; and institutions Civil, the growth of countless ages, blow Into the air at once, and all the arts Be prostrate, and mankind roam savages, And howl among the woods, thirsting for blood; And seeking food amid the beasts of prey! It must be so, if merely brutal force Permitted be to level all the laws! They, whom it is the object of the laws To govern, cannot be the governors: Nor is it possible, that there can be The liberty, that may with laws dispense! From the creation there has always been Among mankind a government and power Supreme, tho' very rarely unabus'd. Yet it must be, with all its bad concomitants, Which ever the most watchful checks demand. There cannot be hereditary right To injure, or to tyrannise over others: But an hereditary right to govern With justice, wisdom, lenity, in modes Prescrib'd by law, may be, and ever has been! And nothing but this right can keep a nation Free from the dangers of the restless stirrings Of craving and ne'er-satisfied ambition! Thus monarchs may be seated in their power Legally, wisely, of necessity: But constitutions form the chains to keep them Within their limits, which they otherwise Would overflow, producing devastation In the domains they ought to fertilise. END OF BOOK V. BOOK VI. Didst thou ne'er visit the magnificent Cathedral of Lausanne? There thou hast seen A noble altar-tomb of Otto Grandson! He was a hero true of chivalry, And in his age fell in a noble duel, Fighting with all the gallantry of youth. He was, I think, if memory does not fail me, Last of the males of his illustrious race: In courts and camps his gallant life had pass'd; And gloried most, where ladies' eyes reign influence. In Vaud's dominions, where his ancient name And spreading lands, impos'd a sway superb, There was a lady fair, the idol wife Of a young neighbouring chieftain, whom this Lord Of Coppet and of Grandson ever view'd With admiration; and perchance with glances Unholy; and it may be, that the dame, Thro' vanity and coquetry, return'd Those ogles: then the flame of jealousy Waked in the husband's bosom to a fire Consuming: but the dame and lord of Coppet, Each swore their innocence: yet ah! the tears, And protestations, of a female heart Were but as wind to an enraged husband. Gallant and fearless, tho to years declining, Great Otto held his head, and went his way. He had his word and oath put forth;—and who Would dare to disbelieve him? He, not he, Would be controul'd by false suspicions; nor Avoid the innocent courtesies due to beauty! Thus often when he met, in social concourse Of arms, and fair ones, and the moving tones Of music, and the awakening minstrel's song, The persecuted lady,—he refrain'd not The glance of pleasure, and the gentle word: And between gratitude and fear, the dame Could not controul her deep emotions, Which the mad husband deem'd the proof of guilt. The discord rais'd between the chiefs became Contagious: and surrounding chieftains, with Their clans, took each their several part; and wore The colours and the badges of their party. O, what a life of anxious turbulent passion The lady led! yet not unmix'd with raptures To be the cynosure of wondring eyes, And to behold the hero, who for her In gallant daring spent his vigorous age. Then she the heroine of the poet's lyre Became; and the idolatry of warm, Mysterious, spell-breathing imagination Invested her with charms, not hers; nor ever To human beauty lotted: but delirium Of hope and vanity inebriated her; And she was willing to believe them hers. Love, hope, revenge, and moments of idolatry Shook her griev'd husband's mind and frame to madness; And he at times beheld her as an angel, That never must be wrested from his arms. Then she grew scornful, and herself deluded That she for earthly love was too celestial. And still the factions grew, and the whole province In a fierce civil war became involv'd. Now Savoy's Prince, in whose domains it lay, Banish'd the hero of the tale; the torch That lighted these disturbances to flame! In England and in France the gallant lover Long tarried, the companion bright of heroes, Of ladies' eyes the wonder and delight: And when at last the irrepressible Love of his native lands recall'd him home, The jealousies and the vindictive passions Of the relentless husband still pursued him! Perhaps it was the indiscretion rash Of female vanity or female love, That rous'd the lion to his prey again! The jealous watchfulness beheld the bosom Heave at the sound of Ottos' name, or saw Her footsteps bending to old haunts; or heard Her whispers in a dream; or caught the tear, That trembled in her eye! then raged again Fiercer than ever the desire for vengeance: And thus he challeng'd Otto to the single Combat: and the firm but worn-out hero gladly Took up the gauntlet, tho his hoary age Freed him from answering the requisition: For now his hair was white, and he had pass'd His sixtieth year: but he had skill, and native Strength far beyond his younger combatant. Now every eye and bosom was engag'd Upon the fearful contest: heroicly The old man fought; and long the war was doubtful: But either by the feebleness of years, Or chance, or destiny, the blow at last Came; and his eyes in death at once were clos'd. And there he lies, clad in his coat of mail, Upon that altar-tomb! Behold the pales And scallops on the bend;—a noble shield Well-known in England, when to Margaret, The kingly Tudor's mother, we our eyes Heraldric turn; for of the blood was she; And drew a noble patrimony from them. But we have much of Grandson's castle heard, When Charles, the Rash, of Burgundy, assail'd it: And the rich diamond was the prize besought, Long buried, found at last, as Montolieu Has in her Châteaux Suisses with eloquence And fancy well related: a strange tale She has confounded with it,—from what source I know not,—thus pretending to connect This precious gem as that which ages after The name of the Pitt Diamond got, from him Who bought it of an Indian chief, thus founding The fortunes of Britannia's greatest ministers; And thus perhaps the destiny of all Europe. Strange history of one single mine-drawn product Passing to France, the greatest ornament Of all that gorgeous court; and then at last Like a sun glaring on Napoleon's sword. And thus the tale of Grandson ends:—at least Upon its ancient patrimonial lands In England long a scion of the stock In rich baronial power and splendor shone; And much I boast that thence I draw my blood Thro' various channels; and amid the store Of my armorial ensigns ever paint Th'heraldric figures of their feudal shield. Early was the paternal line of sires I spring from, by direct espousal join'd To this great house Burgundian, when transported To that Welsh border, where the conqueror's chieftain Made inroads on the wild and obstinate Britons; As he, the great magician of the North, Has well recounted in his spell-like tales. And thus I venture, in a calm defiance Of sneers, and taunts, and smiles, and sharp remonstrances, Still of myself to speak; for who can tell So surely of another's thoughts and feelings, As of his own? And what the passages In other poets—Milton, Cowley, Cowper, And yet an hundred more, to which we turn With most delight? By one congenial taste All hang on those fond undisguised effusions, Where all the secret moves of their own hearts They open lay; confess their weaknesses; Put forth their hopes; let out the hidden springs Of their ambitions, toils, and vanities; And justify, or wail with tears of sorrow, The paths that they have trodden. If they speak The truth, they find an echo in the bosoms Of all their readers: but if false, the tone Betrays them; then the listener has his triumph In the ascendant o'er a vain pretender. Truth is for ever simple; affectation And labour are the proofs of base disguise. There is no eloquence, where there is labour; And rarely truth: and what with toil is written, But slowly catches others' apprehension. It has abruptness, and the natural Alliance of ideas is destroyed: For in the mind Nature implants her links; And these we follow as by intuition. Among the innumerable charms of Shakespeare This, this is not the least. Historic Tales Form an essential portion of my song. Therefore I must not pass in silence thee, Ripaille!—down close upon the rippling waters The ruins of thine ancient palace stand,— Adjoining Thonon in the Chablais! Savoy Still o'er that ancient heritage holds her sceptre. There the first Duke of that now royal House Twice in retirement from ambition's thorns Sought the tranquillity of solitude. Strange was his fate,—from princely sovereign To privacy,—and then to sovereign power Ecclesiastic, as Rome's Pontiff, rais'd;— And then the proud tiara's power again Resign'd, once more to privacy with thee Retir'd, Ripaille!—But not as hermit strict, Cell-like, and self-denying, as, tis said: But with his choice companions, gay, luxurious, And pleasure-seeking! Luxury and peace Could not keep off the dart of death.—He died Within these walls, ere long! To him Lausanne, And old Geneva's beautiful abode, Familiar were. But witty Voltaire's Muse Has moralis'd upon his fate; and I Fly from a theme touch'd by a popular author. From what old root the princely race of Savoy Derived their primal growth, historians differ.— Of Saxon, some;—from the old stock of kings Burgundian, others:—in the ninth or tenth Century, they began their wings expand, And never lost the active principle Of gradual aggrandisement, by arms, By marriages, by policy, by ruse! In Italy, in Burgundy, in France Th'extension ever equally was sought: Never at rest, their schemes they still were planning: But all this turbulence of spirit ended In feebleness at last, and abdication. And thus the circuit of thy Lake, Geneva, Has my Muse made, descriptive sometimes,—oftner Dealing in sentiment, and observation, Thought, argument, and intellectual matter. If we can cull the images of Nature With more of brilliance than reality, Then it is good:—but surely 'tis an higher Task to associate them with intellect; And teach the duller minds to comment on them; And how to feel; and with what other images To join them. Of all Milton's poetry Three parts are intellectual; not material. Thus I agree with Pope, not to approve, “Where pure description holds the place of sense!” Where nothing but the fancy is amused, It is a somewhat barren entertainment. Ever we wish in noblest poetry, To have a stretch of all the faculties; And not alone the bosom, and the fancy, And bright imagination's powers creative, To exercise; but to improve the judgment; And by a clearer, broader view of things, To draw conclusions more enlarg'd, and just Without imagination is no poetry; And without judgment also the production Cannot the glory of the higher class Attain. Among the Muse's favourites, Of right admitted, who will dare to name One, not possess'd of all the powers of mind, In strong predominance? True bards are never Idle and empty dreamers: they are moral Philosophers, of th' classes most enlighten'd. There is no genuine poetry, but in truth;— Truth in the principle, and similitude!— The thoughtless may raise up their eyes, and stare, Since they have heard that poetry is fable! But they forget that fiction still may be The vehicle of Truth! It is the fabled And allegorical embodiment Of abstract Truth! If it embodies Falsehood, 'Tis but a vile and base delusion! Nor will the charms of Falsehood be enduring. We may be caught a moment by delusive Colours; but soon they fade before our eyes: And never does the loveliness of Truth Require factitious ornaments: in her nakedness She is most lovely! Thus the majesty Of thought in Milton's strains is most sublime, When plainest! Thus all floridness is empty;— The mark of a weak artificial mind!— But when the ornament is of the essence Of the high thought, not then can it be empty! For sometimes do the thought, and its accompanying Language of illustration, rise together! Trite thoughts in flowery language are like harlots In gaudy millenery: fine without;— Faded, deform'd, and spiritless within. When a thought wants the setting off of dress, It is a proof 'tis worthless in itself. Never the movements of the subtle mind, Rich in its treasur'd stores, will be exhausted. Genius may ever ply her toils upon them, And still develop something new and useful. The shades of difference, the nice distinctions, Of which the course of time and of occasion Calls for th'observance; th'inexhaustible Varieties of application, Demand original faculties of judgment. The power of combination, and comparison, And keen discrimination, and command Of words, to others to communicate them Clearly and forcibly. It is a talent Of enviable puissance to seize New features, strong and undeniable, Not hitherto observ'd, and bring them forth To meet th'assent of every future gazer. For how innumerable are the minds, That can assent and follow;—yet not lead! The few, that on their own resources live, Will not disturb themselves by others' dictates, But still with their own faculties examine, And form their judgments on their own convictions. Then there is always freshness in the manner; And to old truths an added testimony. But repetition of old borrow'd tunes Is like the music of the organ grinder, Filling the streets and air with heedless noises. The memory is a treacherous quality, If too much faith be put upon its stores; For it the higher faculties seduces Into a sleeping idleness, while all Is ready, free from labour of creation, For the demand which each occasion raises. But there's a stirring and inquisitive spirit, Which will not rest on pledge of others' word: But still must set its own impatient instruments To work; and sift and balance, and essay All by strict tests and measures of its own. Then Memory, the storekeeper, is useful To furnish the materials,—not alone From other sources drawn, but by the powers Of th'architect's own mind already form'd In simpler combinations, or as elements For future buildings. Yet go thro the authors In many languages with critical Acumen;—you will find originality Most rare!—It chiefly is the borrow'd store, Somewhat disguis'd by foreign ornament. Yet they who have the faculties ever working, Fermenting, new-composing, are too apt To have th'impressions of the memory Disturb'd, derang'd, and many times defac'd. When the same subject they again renew, They re-create; and do not bring again The old creation; often cast, indeed, In the same mould; and of identical likeness. But they, who venture for themselves to think, And yet cannot think right, would do far better To tread in others' paths, and follow guides. Originality in being wrong Is not a merit worthy of the laurel; But only fit to raise a stare, like conjurers At country wakes! The forms of Nature never Must outrag'd or exaggerated be. “Truth” as the critic Johnson nobly says, “Always sufficient is to fill the mind!”— One tint too much; one over-strained feature; One combination false; one evil junction Of heterogeneous elements, destroys The spell, and utterly dissolves the merit. The strong exaggeration is not genius; It is the artifice of the sterile bungler: And ever in the richest minds the thought, That lies beneath, is stronger and more glowing Than the free, frank, involuntary language, Which, hurried forward, follows it in vain. For rapid thought did never yet permit The stay for studied words: and he, who labours Upon the scent, will ne'er arrest his prey. We cannot on the blazes of the sky Steadily look for a continuance; But must avert our eyes on other objects: And while we look, the blaze is gone; and other, And other shapes and hues, burst from the clouds, And call us to pursue them; and the charm Is vanish'd, if we seize not at the moment. We read, or only ought to read, for wisdom; And what deludes, is the reverse of wisdom. False hues, false facts, and false associations, If for a moment they assent and faith Impose, with folly's poisons misdirect: And if no faith they waken, then no pleasure Can they arouse: for where belief there is not, There is no charm. Thus fairy superstitions, Which the mind is not nurtur'd to give ear to, Are but a child's amusements; and all mysteries, Which judgment and which reason will admit not, Ill suit the taste of a sound intellect. “I hate what I cannot believe!” said Horace. Then fools of some most babyish invention Cry, “'tis a pretty fancy!”—Fancy thus, When she in artificial fiction deals, Wastes all her toil in gewgaws; and her breath Exhausts in blowing bubbles. 'Tis not harmless; For the true strain it to discredit brings; And in one censure critics, and the world, Of bosoms hard and stupid heads, involve All who in metre write, and strike the strings Of the lyre, false or genuine. All, which they, Who sounder minds and sterner tastes affect, Have said in cold disparagement of poetry, Only to these false fablings will apply. What other human being, in the strength And soundness equally, as in the lustre Of intellect, could e'er compare with Dante, Petrarch, and Spenser, and divinest Milton? All highest human wisdom; all opinion Most lofty and enlighten'd; all exalted Sentiment, in the Muse's strains is found. And if it be an idle empty note, Bearing no solid and instructive matter, It is not of the Muse:—the Muse will never Own it, as from the fount of Helicon. And why should not the Muses be the deities, Who of the soundest lore their lessons give? Are not the faculties, which separately In other intellectual beings live, United all in them? 'Twould then be strange, Did they not clearer see, and deeper pierce Than others? Above all, intuitive knowledge Is theirs, and half-inspir'd sagacity, Which sees the complex workings of the soul, And from its causes draws the line of action, Which time, and the strong tide of human things, Will gradually unfold in man's existence. He, who believes that he can stir a step From censure safe, and from sinister comments, Is a most inconvenient self-deceiver. Passions of Envy and of Jealousy Over the world predominate; and Dulness Mistakes, or will not even notice take. Th'objector—and the world is ever full Of keen objectors,—will with plausibility Exclaim, that if my theory were true Of th' poet's art;—its uses and abuses— Then the true bard would ever find the fame He merits, and pretenders be proscrib'd:— But that it is not so; and they who, judging By tests here urg'd, are empty charlatans, Are oft the idols of the multitude, While genius pines neglected, and e'en starves. All this, no doubt, is strange, and contradictory; But 'tis, perhaps, the fearfulness of judging By one's own feelings, and the evil custom Of following the leader, when some critic, Who learn'd his art by measure and by rule, Has got pessession of the public ear. The false dominion is by lapse of time Broken; and the true flame bursts forth at last Thro clouds and darkness; and forever after Shines unobstructed. Milton thus, and Collins, And many another bard, who struggled long With his unkind cotemporaries, lives. The mob of readers read not what they like; But what it is the fashion to admire: They read that they may talk, and be prepar'd With knowledge of the topics others talk of:— And what is artificial, is more easily Learn'd than the natural; for native merit Requires a mirror bright by nature's force. Those mirrors are not rare; but rarely trust To their own strength and action. Popular taste Is, as sage Horace, in past ages, sung, As fleeting and capricious as the winds. If the sole spur of fame be popular clamour, Then will the track of fame be false and vulgar. The bard must be prepar'd t'encounter coldness, Unblighted, and uncheck'd; and onward go Firm and undaunted; while around him fools Are cheer'd, and on men's shoulders mounted high. But oft is Genius morbid,—and neglect Withers her heart, or turns the brain to madness. Thus most unhappy Collins!—when his notes Divine, fell dead upon the public ear, With deep resentment to the flames he gave Those precious monuments of inspiration; Then wild disorder his benighted fancy Afflicted, and his bodily vigour fail'd, And a few years he pin'd in gloom, or shrieked His sorrows thro his native city's cloisters; And found tranquillity but in an early grave! But this submission to the world's unkindness Was but a weakness, which detracted from The grandeur of his genius. Not, with swords Of public vengeance hanging over him, Did Milton's spirit quail. In poverty And blindness he went on to weave the web Of his immortal Epic:—and he died Tranquil and happy in maturity Of years. His calm self-estimate, and confidence In his own glorious powers, was never shaken By all the deadly frost of biting breaths, Or dark aversion of a vicious court, And flinty-hearted people. “If they hear not,” He said, “posterity will hear, and glorify “My spirit! and while floating in the skies, “My ghost will listen to the swelling notes, “That on the wings of winds shall bear my name “Throughout all countries, and all distant ages!” To ponder on the growing web was rapture, E'en though no other knew it but himself: 'Tis true he could not with his outward eyes See it; but in his mental vision brightly It shone;—and he, above all earthly power Of kings and rulers, flourish'd; and in scorn, With stern republican virtue sat and mus'd!— And now I to myself return!—“What, egotisms? “Eternal egotisms!”—Yes, egotisms! Johnson has said, that the obscurest person, If frankly he the movements will relate Of his own heart and mind, can be amusing, And e'en instructive! and the cavilling public With lively interest has ever read The auto-biographic page, if vanity And falsehood do not their disgusting poison Infuse too copiously. The writer may Deceive himself, but if he wilfully Will others misinform, then scorn will justly His portion be! And there is no deception, Which will avail to mingle the ungenuine With the sincere! The marked difference strikes A common reader; and the artifice At once explodes, and wakes contempt and hatred. 'Tis said that pity nearly is allied To scorn; but surely this has been incautiously And incorrectly hazarded by sages. Pity is more allied to love and friendship. It is superiority, which wakens Distrust, and jealousy, fear, and avoidance. With common weaknesses, and common frailties We sympathise: but him, who is above us In strength of heart, and freedom from the follies And imperfections of humanity, We may admire and fear, but rarely love. When the illustrious and exalted bosom Is soften'd by adversity, we then With all its sorrows take companionship. Reserve is but the trait of a false pride, And heart of cowardly dread of strict observance: 'Tis by the nice inspecting of himself And undisguised disclosure, that we learn Man's inward nature: if we know not that, Our knowledge is but barren, and of naught. Then, if I have forever made confession Of all my feelings; of the injuries, And troubles, and misfortunes, that my lot Has destin'd me in a tempestuous life Incessantly to strive with,—am I wrong? And if I tell the common ills of life, The hopes destroy'd, the light mortifications, The scorn of “boobies mounting o'er one's head.” The sting of calumny, the dart of envy, They are the conflicts all have to encounter;— Whence sympathy' or instruction all may draw; And thus when in a glass we see the workings Reflected, we can better study them: The shades are often nice, and tints are flying; And when the pen or pencil does not fix them, They are too airy for comparison, Too subtle, and of too much evanescence, Shadowy, and changeable as is the rainbow. But it is crime, it seems, to talk of self, E'en in th'endeavour to detect these movements Of intellectual and invisible spirit; And all those impulses, by which the blood In hidden tracks circulates round the heart! There is likewise in literature a secret History, wisdom well may wish to learn: The hopes, the fears, mischances, and defeats Of the Bard's life, are not a trifling theme. But then the question comes, “who is a Bard?”— And not to me the multitude allow The boon is given. Surely to write in metre, Cannot alone a poet constitute! It is a spirit indefinable; A flame of intellect, and glowing heart, Which rules and measures at defiance sets; Which comes with exhalations from the fountain Of sweetness and of purity; which wakes In the air music, and involuntarily The human bosom on its floating stream Bears away with it; which analysis Defies, and laughs at all the critic's laws; And by its own internal force, where all Of outward look is simple, shadowy, empty, With a resistless power of magic works. It is a partial dispensation of The breathings of some higher class of beings. 'Tis not the language, but the thought and feeling, Which makes the spell; and in the humblest prose, And words least ornamented, it may shine! And thus it shines in Bunyan's vulgar phrase.— Perchance it rises from the living presence Imagination to all objects gives; And from that presence there is warmth and vigour, Which memory has not the power t' impart: Memory gives alone a faint, and partial, And technical resemblance,—not the living Object; and with no actual passions burns. Oft 'tis a memory of words and signs, Not of the very images: then 'tis cold E'en as the sculptor's stone, or painter's canvass. But from the elements, which Nature's scenery Plants on the fancy's mirror, and the intuitive Impressions of some celestial objects, And aspirations, and emotions loftier, Inventive genius joins, and thus creates, The presence of a million rapturing visions. This is the genuine theory of poetry; Not the dogmatic dulness of cramp pedants, Whose knowledge is mechanical and barren. Not all the labour, learning, art, that mind Can most apply, will aught avail to wake From the lyre's strings the Muse's genuine tones. 'Tis not the subject, nor the elements Of which the theme is woven,—'tis the warmth, The life, the tints, the atmosphere; the halo Of brightness, and of glory that surrounds it; Which in the fountains of Imagination Springs, and is fann'd, and flames. There is no fruit Of poetry, in other climes that ripens. When in the hot-bed of mechanical heat 'Tis rais'd, it has no flavour; and it dies! Thus I approach my task's allotted bound! In six and twenty nights successively No interruption has disturb'd its progress. Much it has babbled, reckless of due order; And much, it will be said, of no connection With its pretended subject. Let it be: Let the mean cavil, as it can, prevail! 'Tis vain to make responses to objections, Which from the temper, not the reason, come! My Muse, I trust, has made no great omissions In noticing the worthies that belong, O Lake sublime, to thy enchanting circuit! In scientific lore she has no ventures; And in describing natural scenery, Best by the pencil touch'd, she has been thrifty. The thought, the sentiment, the character Of human intellect—the heart of man,— She has attempted most with daring hand Frankly to draw the veil from. If the touches Be neither true, nor plausible; nor worthy Regard, the cypher'd leaves will be a waste, That the winds soon will scatter in the air. But if of men, life, manners, their pursuits, And their opinions, there be justice, force, Or honourable feeling, in his judgments, Then will his mental toils have not been vain! It is not from the stores of memory, But from th'internal fountain we must speak: All that the memory gives, is stale and faint; And adds no knowledge to the minds of others. The repetition of the self-same things; The mimickry of notes; the mocking bird,— Is not alone inane;—it is disgusting! Nothing more rare than the original songster; Nothing so common as the mocking-bird!— So, when the great Magician of the North Bursts forth with a new note, a thousand echoers Start up at once, and indiscrimination Believes them genuine rivals, or perchance Superior, if there be defects, or negligences, Which trick and effort can exaggerate! And so again, when by a spell the eloquent Creator of Otranto's Castle told His witch-like, horror-breathing, tale, competitors Rose numerous, and their stories wild of ghosts, And gothic halls, and battlements, and helmets, Giants, and dwarfs, and pigmies, multiplied: But never one in spirit, or the genuine Essence of that, which made the charm, succeeded. There is no place for mediocrity; No hope, no saving point. So Horace sung:— And who has since his judgments countervail'd? All the mechanical produce of the press, For vulgar readers manufactur'd, is A curse, a poison! It dissolves the force Of mind, and all its elements; misleads, Where there is interest in error; damps Th'originator in his wasting toils; Destroys the fire of genius; and the laurel Blights with the counterfeit of rays eclipsing. Then comes ennui, and cold neglect, and scorn, And mean confusion of the high and worthy With charlatanic dealers in the trade Of words, and borrow'd thoughts, and stolen facts, And pourings of quick poison in the cauldron. Two centuries, and perchance another half, Have pass'd, since England, and perhaps all Europe, The trade began of manufacturing A mental food to please the public appetite. Then Robert Greene and Thomas Nash, and others, Their boon associates, gain'd their daily bread By furnishing the press with tales and fancies, In prose and verse, fitted to gratify The undiscerning taste of common minds. The lore was mingled much with conversational Phrases and topics;—full of vulgar saws, And trite opinions, and the modes of judging Of life familiar to the popular talk: But they were men of genius, and debas'd Their faculties, for want, and gain of lucre. They liv'd in misery; they died in poverty; And in the ages, that succeeded them Their writings were waste paper, held in scorn Their very names, and even of their authors, Forgotten; though, again, the present day Seeks them to gratify the rich collectors Of ancient rarities; and curious critics Are willing an imaginary merit To find in them; and truly they sometimes Manners and language usefully illustrate: And here and there a burst of fire, and eloquence, Breaks forth, that has the seeds of life in it. In this strange world 'tis vain to seek to separate The good and evil:—they together grow! But yet th'abuses of the press are frightful;— A pestilence which daily wretchedness, Prostration of the mind, affliction, ruin, And death itself, works out! the chymical drug The particles of governments dissolving, And letting loose the chains that tie the dogs Of anarchy! Then, on the contrary, Where were th'englight'nment of the world without it What should we do at the deprival of The eloquence of genius, and of wisdom? Authors are now so multitudinous, That awe and reverence for the occupation Is gone; and general readers have no talent The genuine from the mechanical To separate;—nay, rather would prefer The false;—which has more method, and more polish. But then they meet the men, and find them common In all their notions and their feelings; and In apprehension dull, in fancy lifeless: And thus they cry, “it wants no qualities Of eminence to have success in letters.” So genius and so learning lose the power Of doing good by awe and reverence: And thus the spur is blunted, that would urge us “To scorn delights and live laborious days.” It was the love of glory, that led on Mortals upon their spiritual wings to keep Their course, in spite of earth's impediments. But when the cheer is ceas'd, and all is dead Of human voices, then the force of man Lasts not, in an exhausting track to bear His onward way! Thus Genius pines in silence, While false pretenders wrest away the chaplet. O thirst of money! 'Tis the universal Passion of human kind:—not thirst of fame! When I have said that I have work'd for fame Thro my woe-follow'd life, few have believ'd me! And work'd not only without gain of money, But at its mighty cost; and knowing too, Beforehand, it would be a cost,—not gain! And if there be a few, who have giv'n faith To the assertion, of those few still fewer But blame it as a folly, if not crime! Then others, if I neither yet have gain'd, Nor could gain if I would, assume 'tis proof Complete, I have not genius, nor e'en talent! They say, the judgment of the multitude Alone, is testimony due of merit:— And that to please a few, is the result Of whim, and partiality, and prejudice. But yet not always has the popular writer The highest worth, or force, or taste, or knowledge. Sometimes there is a base necessity, Down to the popular taste to write,—not up! Then, as it is my folly to be frank, And many a mighty ill has risen from it, Let me confess, (for frank confessions always Relieve my loaded heart,) that I could never The public please, or gain a kind reception!— 'Tis natural, that they, who have the fortune To suit the people, should insist upon it To be the only true criterion Of real merit.—Yet does reason justify The rule? And are the many loftier-minded And wiser, than the few, whom nature's gifts Endow, and toils of learning still improve? Judgment and taste in part are the results Of nice and wide comparison. The multitude Cannot have leisure for this painful culture. Sometimes, as in the mighty northern bard, The magical creator of high tales, The gifted few and general public voice Concur! It is where Nature's touches strike, With art unmingled, on the human bosom!— But they who struggle in the common bustle Of life, and by its common passions move, To a sympathy with those sublimer notions, Which actuate the few, are too insensible. Those impulses disturb their daily courses, And render the rough path, they have to tread, Too painful to a temperament refin'd, And blood rais'd to a sensitive excess. Why should I fear my thoughts and sentiments To lay before the world, if I believe them True? Scorn, or ridicule, cannot affect Wisdom, or truth, or virtue:—generous feelings May be the mockery of brutal vice; Or shameless hardness of an icy heart: But soon the scorn will turn upon the scorner, And he be cover'd by his earthly foulness. 'Tis affectation, and base artifice, Which ought to tremble at the piercing eye Of rival candidates for fame and favour. When art is in her odious colours shewn, When false pretension is expos'd to view Bare, then for fame comes killing ignominy:— But not for what is said in perfect faith, And with intention virtuous. If indeed It be faint, trite, and foolish,—in the scorn, Or dead neglect, which covers it, there is A sting, or breath-stopping oppression, hard To bear, and carefully to be avoided. But ere the self-delusion prompts the utterer His voice to lift upon the public stage, There must be in the foolish, and the stupid, Some wilful error in the estimate Of force and of acquirement. Man is reckless Of brother man's self-love, and lets him know, In terms which cannot be misunderstood, Where nature has been sparing of her gifts. It is, perhaps, th'effect, of evil habit, That of themselves men make erroneous estimates: Nature points out to them where they are weak; And trial, and comparison, a lesson Of certainty they cannot fly from, gives. For public censure, and for public praise, In all the minor literary journals, It now is prov'd, and known to all the world, That they are bought and sold, and hireling scriblers Are kept in pay by grasping publishers, To recommend their goods by fulsome flatteries, And odious falsehoods. But pursued too far, Fraud, trick, and gross mendacity, will explode At last; and some new artifice must soon Be plann'd, and enter'd on, to vend bad wine! 'Tis true, the mean deception is discover'd Ere long, but not until the bad commodity Is sold; and thus the vendor gains his purpose; And for a time supports a thriving trade. Then all intruders on the lucrative Profession they are driving, these apt penmen Pursue with vengeance to extermination, To brethren of the quill,—of the same factions— Alone will they mercy and peace extend;— Or liberty to enter in the regions Of authorship, as members of the elect! By rules precisely the reverse of those, On which true criticism must be built, They ply the instruments of their base trade,— Their rules and measures. More of loathsome art, And toil mechanical, the more with them The merit;—and the more of natural gift And inspiration, less to be distinguish'd, Or pass'd without some scoff, or taunt, or bitterness, Or wicked and malign misrepresentation. With them,—who works for fame, is or a fool, Or a most dangerous miscreant, who must be Crush'd for the common benefit of the trade! Does chance or hard necessity e'er press The genuine son of Genius to the faction? But in those cells of mean intrigue, amid Foul lucre's birds of prey he draws his breath; Clouds, vapours, pestilence, absorb his faculties, And turn his powers to poison and corruption. Yet there's an outward and most plausible semblance Oft in this hot-bed produce, which has poignancy For vicious tastes: but soon it rots, and dies; Has no revival; and is heard no more: For it has naught of native life in it; And only breathes by fashion, and caprice. But the true strain will live for ever;—frost And snow and blight and tempest cannot injure it, Or paralyse the force and glow of spirit, That circuit thro its arteries and elements. After the lapse of ages still it lives And breathes, e'en as at first it liv'd and breath'd. No artificial poet;—none whose flame Was secondary and derivative, Has ever liv'd in fame for half a century Beyond his mortal life, though many an one Of this inferior merit has obtain'd A temporary reputation. The days and hours are drawing to an end, When I approach the close of my farewell. My Muse has freely flow'd without or effort, Or artifice, or polish, or disguise. It has no claim upon the ground of ornament, Or illustration, or concinnity And happiness of phrase, or harmony Of metre: nor can place its hope of favour But in the force and rectitude of thought, And purity of native sentiment. If, though these thoughts and sentiments be true, They yet be stale and trite, they claim no mercy;— And I well know they will not, cannot, have it! The matter may be found conformable To much of many an author, who precedes me. Not therefore is it borrow'd: if it has The stamp of truth, but little can it differ; For truth is constant and immutable. Yet not the less, e'en though already said, May be the use of saying it again, Grounded upon concurrence of observance, And sympathy of bosom, if there be The charm of novel language, and fresh life.— The borrower is ever known by technical Marks of his theft; and artificial phrases Identical; and trains of thought the same, When not allied by nature but by whim. But in the paths of lonely meditation For sixty years have I explor'd my way; Nor sought a guide, nor trod upon the steps Of others;—oft in darkness; oft in storms; Oft by the fairy lights of silver moonbeams; And sometimes in the garish glow of day, Beneath meridian suns. The stores we gather, We are not willing should exhaust themselves, Pent up within the bosom's dark abode: That which is sought in solitude, is sought Full oft for social purposes;—alone We do the task, which is for fellow-man; And but retire to think with more intenseness Upon humanity;—its griefs and joys! 'Tis only by incessant pondering, That we can know the mysteries of man's nature: And by the unrelaxing exercise Of all the mental faculties, can gain Precision of ideas, and command Of language, to express them properly. Much it imports us all, the lights and shades Of moral science, deeply and precisely To be familiar with; the human character In all its passions and varieties To see reflected, as upon a mirror, And all the tribes of just association To clear and strengthen in our feeble minds. We do not love to think exclusively, And have no sympathy with fellow-beings. But few are they, who in their riper years Care for the tricks or gems of poetry. 'Tis only in the essence of the matter, The spirit of the Muse, an audience sound Can take delight, and in the simplest words, And plainest dress, and rudest numbers, may That spirit live, and be communicated!— If the strain be too long; of dull reflection Too copious,—in sentiment affected, Or false, unvirtuous, and inanimate; If imagery in portion due be wanting, And if too intellectual, immaterial, In incident deficient, and in pathos; Beyond the requisite limits of a poem Didactic,—which pretends not to the charms Of vulgar fable,—let it have the fate It shall in candour merit! Not on one Task of the mind do I rely for favour! Much have I labour'd, and in various walks, E'en though but rarely cheer'd by human praise. And now, when at the age of man arriving, I do not find my humble faculties clouded, But can from midnight to the seventh hour Prolong the task unwearied, then be ready For the day's ordinary occupations; It is a load thrown off my bosom;—lighter I feel at the discharge; and if no day Passes without some innocent toil perform'd, I feel a joy that I can shew the progress Of my existence by some visible sign, That marks the course of one day from another. There was a time when the disorder'd current Of my blood, like a weight upon my brain Sat, and oppress'd it;—thus for two sad years And more, my faculties were dull and stagnant: But all at once the vapour broke away; And in an instant my o'er-mantled brain Burst to a flame, that ever since has blaz'd! And still, O Leman Lake, on thy beloved Waters I daily look; and see the sun Rise over Alpine mountains; nor has once Sleep overpower'd me at its earliest dawn, For thirteen months successively. And now, For nine and forty nights uninterrupted, Have I the strain continued;—and I close. END OF BOOK VI. BOOK VII. It is a charge against me, that I cherish The love of praise too much: they mean the love Of flattery. Now I deny the charge: I love to gain th'attention of the wise And good:—for who would labour day and night, Yet gain no notice? who does so, must have A most egregious confidence in self!— Who has a powerful apprehensiveness, Knows his own faults, and weaknesses, and failures; And ever to the test of others' judgments Is driven with a just anxiety! He hails approval therefore with delight; But this is not a love flattery! 'Tis ever thus, where to a vase two handles Exist to hold it by, they take the wrong: And where there is a candid and uncandid Comment, to which a quality is subject, The harsh censorious world th'uncandid take, A rectitude of thought and sentiment Is the grand praise, to which the noble-minded Aspire: but of that rectitude what proof Other than commendation can be had? And who is he who can presume to say; “I to myself am all; and 'tis sufficient “Of my own mighty mind to have th'approval!”— Each one may have perverse associations, And some delusive sentiments, which meet not The sympathy of others. Then to learn By praise, one's writings from these ills are free, Is a just satisfaction. A mind enlighten'd By clear, pure, accurate, and kindly views;— A bosom of benevolent, and generous, And glowing feelings; a fine faculty Of lucid language, easily educ'd, Are worthy of “the fostering dew of praise!” But it is true, that we must guard our passion For this approval, and for lofty fame! It may too fiercely grow upon our hearts, And burn us up, or lead us wide astray: It must not breed conceit, or insolence, Scornful neglect, or puff'd up vanity.— Without the spur of this sublime aspiring, How could the checks and fogs of life be conquer'd? The melancholy Young has in his satires Shewn that the love of fame is universal! Distinction, good or bad!—for to be notic'd; And 'tis sufficient—e'en for folly' or crime. But if the passion be for virtuous fame— Of intellectual loftiness, 'tis judg'd With all severity and mean distortion! Fame is capricious; often she is long In coming, but with labour due, and prayer, And perseverance, she will come at last; Yet not perchance until the grave has clos'd The human ear, and back again to earth Consign'd the mortal part. The Spirit in the air No doubt will hear the tributes consecrated To the cold tomb! O what delight it is To think our memories will still survive, After the spark of mortal life is out! It will be pleasant to have left a record Of our opinions and imaginations; Of that which rais'd the tremblings of the heart, And fill'd the eye with rapture, and awaken'd The hand to strike the lyre's resounding strings. To let life glide away in barren silence, Nothing done, plann'd, or hop'd, or even dream'd, Is an existence of true wretchedness! I would have every day throughout the year By some increase to wisdom's treasures mark'd: The page of learning, and intelligence, And reason high, must not be slumber'd over; Attention deep, and ever exercis'd, And recollection most severely task'd, And nice discrimination; and the movements Of bosom, always in strong excitation, Watch'd with an hand that shadows can embrace, Are necessary to supply the appetite Of virtuous and long-enduring glory. No certain bliss is in a sensual being: The pleasures pall; and then become disgusting: The meanest being has a conscience, which Reproaches him for falling from the state Of intellectual desires and hopes. Each day steals from him some material part Of an existence, which is wearisome; Yet for the hope of better gives the fear Of something worse:—a dark perplexing road, All clouds, and cares, and heaviness to tread! Ever to intellect there is a novelty, Which each successive day brings forth; the eye Grows stronger, and sees further, and more clearly; And every day the old materials, turning To some new use, gain some new interest. The faculties by practice grow more vigorous, Subtle, and sharp. In a false path, surrounded by false lights, And in the heat of a factitious air, Sometimes the mind adds toil intense to toil, By necromancer's wand to raise delusions. Thus Calvin, in the fervor of his zeal Religious, strangely blind and harsh became; And what he claim'd himself from bigot Rome,— The liberty of thought,—gave not to others; But persecuted it, when contrary To his own dogmas, not alone with punishment; But death, e'en at the stake in burning flames! Had he his doctrines preach'd, where Rome's religion Prevail'd, he would assuredly have deem'd it Impious and merciless, the same infliction Of mortal vengeance to have given to him! Yet did Rome deem his doctrines as repugnant To the true faith! Let us then take the worst Of Servet that his enemies pronounce; 'Tis said that he was restless, turbulent, Free-thinking, of an evil genius, Dealing in dangerous speculations, And blasphemously upon holy secrets Prying, a sceptic in the mysteries Of necessary faith! 'Tis thus that Rome Deem'd of the liberal Protestant! But then, O Calvin, boasting that thou fledst away From impious and idolatrous persecution, And that thou wast thyself the blest apostle Of freedom and pure worship,—didst become Relentless persecutor of whoever With thee agreed not; and 'tis said that treachery Thy vengeance aggravated! From thy secret Intrigues and accusations in a foreign State he was sued, and driven by fear to exile; And when to the abodes, where thou preach'dst liberty As to a land of refuge and protection, He came, a prison met him at thy urgency, And thou becam'st his most blood-thirsty accuser! Then nothing but the stake would satisfy Thy craving appetite of cruel death! And thus he was condemn'd for free opinion Upon a point of subtle speculation; Last to the stake was brought;—the faggots round him Pil'd,—and the fire applied to burn his body, And loose his soul from mortal frame in torment! But the wind blew the flames away, and slowly His body was consum'd to death; as if The elements combin'd his pain to lengthen; And he in his excruciating dolour Cried out: “O quicker burn, thou fire! O quicker! “And end my agonies, and Calvin's triumph! “See with what gloating joy he turns upon me “His furious eyes! and blesses the rude blasts, “That draw aside the fire, that it may slower “Perform its work, and thus augment my sufferings! “Is this the man of mercy;—the apostle “Of mild religion? the fam'd instrument, “The mind of man from slavery to deliver? “Peace, and benevolence, and charity, “To preach to all? More vehemently Rome “In her ferocious despotism never “Raged! ah me! from wolf to still more ravenous, “Blood-sucking, and heart-tearing tyger, I “Have fall'n a victim! Rome, resume your prey; “And, as he deals with me, so deal with him!” Then the wind blew the smoke away; the flames Ascended bright; and then a mighty cloud Came o'er the sky, and thunder roll'd, and lightning Darted; and Servet then gave up the ghost;— And Calvin trembled, and went home to gloom, Half sullenly delighted, half afraid. Now worn with cares, ambition, pride, revenge, Mingled with holy zeal, he pin'd away, And died exhausted at a middle age. It would not be unmeet, if the bold Muse Should enter into this Man's mystic heart; This stiff-neck'd puritan; this bold corrector Of moral sinfulness; this harsh usurper Of freedom for himself, of tyranny Over the minds and hearts and acts of others! I am not willing to dethrone a name From exaltation by long ages sanction'd: But who can reconcile the death of Servet With a good heart, or holy principles? It was th'undoubted principle of Calvin To pull down all above him;—all below, Under his feet to tread. The subtle poison Of his insidious doctrines shot contagion Thro all old governments, and like some chymical Element, could dissolve and separate Ties and alliances of time and reason. If there be mysteries in papal doctrines, Not less are those of Calvin! They 're pretences, Under a spiritual cloak to gratify A temporal ambition; and to cover Sensual indulgence of all wordly vices By odious, cunning, mean hypocrisy. Treachery, breach of faith, and robbery, And reckless selfishness, are thus encourag'd; And yet not thus exactly did the Founder Of this puissant sect conduct himself. Many of the sterner virtues he himself Rigidly practis'd; toilsome, abstinent, Direct, unhypocritical, forbearing In self indulgence, but in pride and anger And bitter vengeance,—those three most imposing And irreligious passions;—a believer In his own doctrines; zealous and devout In the Creator's service,—day and night, Working to the great end he undertook! And such is man's immingled being; such His imperfections and his woeful frailties! High virtues and high vices;—pride satanic, With adoration of the Deity; And with a daily prayer that love and kindness Might in the heart grow up, relentless cruelty, Chains, rods, the sword, the stake, the flames, the halter, With reason sound and most severe, delusion And blindness where a favourite doctrine rose; A love of freedom, yet a bigot faith; Irrational belief on Heaven's Election, And favouritism, which would be impeachment Of the Divinity's unbending justice;— Faith separated from action, the most dangerous Doctrine for human virtue. In days of old the punishment of death Distains the pages of all history:— As if for slight offences man might take Away the existence of a brother being! And above all, for wrongs against the State, Where doubtful policy may justify Various opinion. Governments, that boasted Of liberty, were scarce more merciful, Or sparing of the sword of final punishment. Alas, all power is wanton, if not cruel! It matters not its form—or king, or oligarchy, Or constitution, or e'en pure republic! A war against authority, 'tis said, Must be suppress'd, or that authority Can for a moment only hold its sway! Check, and a retribution may be necessary; But not by death,—except for such rebellion As aims at life of others! Thus we read With pity, or with horror, the strange tale Of Spiffame's execution in the Molard! He was a man of high accomplishments, Of learning, intellect, and genius, A statesman, and a courtier, hospitable, Splendid, and witty, and of blandest manners: And for religion's sake had refuge taken Within this Reformation's capital! But he was call'd capricious and inconstant, And sigh'd again for wider scenes of action; And sought within the bosom of Rome's church To be receiv'd once more, and for reward To get a bishopric: he was betray'd Back to his puritanic domicile!— There was the lock of private muniments Broken, and a false document of marriage, To gain his heritage for a bastard issue, Brought forth, and made a capital accusation Before the high tribunal of the State! He was found guilty, sentenc'd, e'en to death; And in three fleeting days dragg'd out, and executed. There are, who of some secret acts of treason With Savoy's Prince suspect him; but for acts Not tried or charg'd, no principles of justice Allow a man to suffer! It is said He died repentant of his heinous sins, In the pure temperament of sanctity; Acknowledging the justice of his sentence; And the sad close of his deceitful life! O hypocrites, who aggravate the dreadful Infliction of a death of violence, And shame, by adding to it false confessions! Who would admit the rectitude of judgment, That was about to take away his being, For such a crime committed years before, In dissolute days, and never acted on? Here Calvin's fierce and unforgiving spirit Rul'd o'er the minds of magistrates and statesmen! It was a fearful time that I would not Have liv'd in, notwithstanding all the boast Of golden ages of our ancestors! But Calvin and his advocates contended, Fierceness alone could counteract the licence Of times so dissolute!—and what of evil, The change of false religion had brought with it, Must be corrected by a pure religion! But that cannot be pure, which deals in death, And blood, the scaffold, hatchet, and the torture! Not home with them did Whittingham, and Knox, A pure religion bring;—but sow'd the seeds Of discord, and of war, and rank distrust, And hatred, and of future rapine, cruelty, And fields and rivers cover'd with the slain. Then the arts ceas'd before the cries of war And canting hypocrites rul'd o'er the land! Thus Caledonia's beautiful and suffering Queen was by Knox's rudeness with foul language Ever insulted; and the eloquent Buchanan upon kings his venom cast! Kings may abuse their power; and thus will power In all hands be at moments ill administer'd:— But power there must be still! in anarchy Will be alone the power of strength and wickedness! The puritan loves power, and is relentless Against all other power, except his own! In England a great noble, of high quality, The puritanic party's cause espous'd;— The favourite of his Queen, the prince luxurious, Who liv'd in all the pride of feudal splendor,— Dudley, of Leicester Earl; a man by crimes, Adulteries and murders, stigmatis'd, As Cumnor's shrieks, and ghostly stain, will witness. He for the church's spoil design'd it well Such patronage to offer; and old Burleigh, Though wise, yet cunning also, held with him. And thus the heroic princess between puritans, And plots of jesuits, had an anxious life. Sagacious wisdom much it ask'd to meet Counter-ferocity, and counter-cunning!— Quickness and courage and magnanimous Decision were her gifts, and lifted her Above the pits and tempests that beset her! By opposite defects her successor Fell into pitiable feebleness: And then the puritanic faction grew, Till in its hour of pride it fell to arms. But we must to the fountain-head return, And talk of him, the chronicler of Genevan Events and manners. Modern annalists Have told strange stories of his latter fate: The tale of Chillon did not end his sufferings. O Bonivard, when from that vault, those chains, And that dark domicile beneath the waves, Thou didst escape to daylight and to freedom, Didst thou not think thy wretchedness and wrongs Had clos'd, and that the future would be days Of peace, and sun-beams, and of social pleasure? But thou hadst fiery blood, that would not rest Contented with exemption from sharp misery: And thou the puritanic whip didst suffer For thy irregularity of manners! The nuptial ceremony in the church Twice celebrated, not enough for thee, Thou didst a third companion at the altar Choose, in the bloom of youth and gaiety, At thy bold fancy's call; but she, of temper Too spritely for thy faded age, with power Tyrannic, and ferocious blows o'er-rul'd thee! Then came the accusation that she took A younger lover to her arms, a crime Puritan cruelty adjudg'd to death. And now, without the husband's charge or will, The wretched woman, and her paramour Alledg'd, were brought before the state-tribunal, Solemnly each protesting innocence;— Then to the torture they were put, to force Confession; and in agony extreme, Beyond th'endurance of their human strength, Each own'd the crime; yet still it is believ'd They were not guilty. But to mercy's sway There then was no concession. Unavailingly They heard the dreadful sentence, and by hand Of public executioner they died! Now, Bonivard, were all thy natural movements Of tenderness by long misfortunes harden'd; And wast thou grown to human misery callous? For thou didst still survive, and still pursuedst Thy wonted occupations! If to stone Thy breast had not been turn'd, thou must have died! The story of thy life proclaims, how far E'en to old age man can retain existence, Under a long intense unbroke succession Of inexpressive sorrows, pangs, and horrors. Up to a certain point, disease, and wrong, And sorrow, soften and ameliorate The human heart:—beyond that point they harden it, And utterly extinguish sympathy. Thus in a battle a great general, Used all his life to warfare, with calm eye Sees fields all strewn with slain of friends and foes, Which not distract his thoughts, or rob his rest! But death upon the scaffold is a trial, Which human courage would beforehand seem Not equal to!—But female innocence And loveliness has stood the test, and risen Glorious above it! seen the block, the axe With its sharp edge, before her, and yet stood Unmov'd, with eyes of glowing light, and scarce A tear of sorrow mingled with their rays! And thus when that sad axe would in a moment End a career which offer'd love and rank And wealth and fame, and all that this fair scene Of worldly pleasures has to offer mortals, O lady Jane! O noblest of the Greys, Proud Suffolk's pure and most celestial daughter, Fair, virtuous, learned, blest with love and hope, And admiration of fair nature's scenes, And joy e'en in the luxury of innocent Existence, yet thy mighty soul could raise Its courage to behold the instrument Serenely, that would separate thee from all; And in a moment bathe thy frame in blood! He, who with narrow ken would view the mind Of man, and have no candour for its frailties, Ever miscalculates, and deludes himself: He knows not what man can do, in defiance Of specks and weaknesses, or faults enormous: By some base narrow measure would the world Chain man's expanding spirit; and his fires Extinguish,—with cold freezing waters trying To prove to him his utter inability. Public opinion always is capricious: He, who has not a firm self-confidence, Can nothing do; for he will meet with checks Ever in places wrong.—On merit fame Sometimes attends;—but, I suspect, too often Not for the worth, but some factitious quality! He, who would work for immortality, Must throw away the thought of temporary Applause, and never bend to popular taste. Of the works, which for a short moment please The public appetite, how few survive! And how should it be other? Taste and judgment Spring from high gifts, by culture and comparison Improv'd! He has a mercenary soul, Who to the public test himself debases! But he who does not this, will many a taunt, And many a reprobation harsh encounter, As if it were his duty to conform To what the multitude adjudge the best!— Thus in his lonely labours he has not Even the cheer of friends, when if they soften Hours of anxiety, they are a balm Friends ought to bless! but they would have him work, E'en as a slave, for money! Who would take The author's, as a mercenary calling? For money-getting work the task is better, E'en to break stones upon the public road! For then at least the thoughts are free and open, And the reward is sure and uncapricious;— With no illusive measure of the toil! There is no inward comfort in the labour, When the mind works for aught but truth alone! To mix a potion for the public draught With sweets, and stimulants, and drugs, and poisons, Is loathsome travel to a noble heart! The price the deleterious draught may sell for, Cannot keep down compunctious pains of conscience: And when the sin is past, and yet the pay Miss'd, and no plaudit follows,—then how sharp The pang!—the baseness e'en for nothing done! A conscious force of genius its reward Has in its work, and its own approbation. But still the cheer of brother-men is grateful, And sometimes will the spirit fail without it, And lose that consciousness and self reliance! We may despise the people's windy clamour, And yet not trust “the still small voice” within! We are beset with blights, and clouds, and frosts, So thickly and so fiercely, that the fire Must be almost too pure, and too enduring For mortal frailty, if it ne'er abates Its warmth, and hope, and heavenly aspiration. When the soul is most visionary, and The flame most intellectual, comes some earthly Damp, and destroys the spell; for in a morbid Mould is the magic airiness of genius Inclos'd, and when it pleads its sensibility, It is but mock'd, and taunted, and insulted. If the nerves were not sensitive to movements Quick and intense, then there could be no genius. O cruel and irrational to call The mind, whose praise is, to the balmy breeze That it is tremulous, and utters music, To shew resistance firm to the rude blast! A sensibility to good alone;— A rocklike, flintlike bosom to the bad,— Where is it to be found? O do not call us To excellence impossible! It breeds Hypocrisy alone, the worst of sins! There are, who think that in the Muse's song Nor wisdom's store, nor good is to be found! They are strange, ignorant, and worthless beings, Who thus can deem! whose misinstructed brains Mistake the trifles of false poetry For streams from Helicon! The Muse disdains But with high truths to deal, which draw the veil From the bad movements of man's heart and head, And teach what man it most behoves to know. The flowers of poetry are the petty ornaments, Which stern and lofty censors scorn to value: It is the force and majesty of thought, Which the Muse most acknowledges for hers. Thus in the ancient records of her art We look for sterling matter; for the stream Of ore, that over golden channels passes. There not the little flowers, that from the banks Upon its surface are reflected, shine. Deep lie its treasures, yet transparent, in Their gem-like beds, which give their stores to mingle With the rich-laden current! Genuine beauty, Or majesty, disdains factitious dresses! We live but to direct, by issuing rays From the mind's lamp, and throw around the brightness That in the shrine of intellect is nurs'd. All is a mystery without, unless The inward mind the secret clues develop. The face of matter barren is, and dull, Without the mind's associations. But only to a few is the boon given To light the fire, and throw the rays abroad; And e'en that fire must much be fann'd and blown, Ere its due lustre it will reach, and clear Itself from smoke and glimmerings:—then the damps It must defy, and burn with constancy. Not to the present—only to the future— Forever must the flame's ascent be rais'd! The rays it gives, can only fix their station Over the tomb: the present race will shun The guide, and rather wil-o'-wisps run after! Truth is not pleasant to the sensual, Vicious, and profligate;—and literature Of artifice is easier as a labour Of gain and dirty lucre, than the flow Which issues from the fount of nature's power. By their own rules and instruments, by which They work themselves, will critics others judge: And while mechanically they instruct The multitude, mechanical will be The multitude in censure or applause. But artifice forever will be variant In motion and in form:—it is its essence;— The only mode by which it whets the appetite. Thus all that it into distinction lifts, Must fall again, as wave upswallows wave! The gift of genius may be rare, but oftenest It in the bud is blighted; or from clouds Cannot emerge, thro' human opposition; Thro' sorrow, or mischance, or want of nourriture Of the seeds sow'd by nature,—sometimes copiously;— Or thro' defect of cheers, or want of courage; Or envy, jealousy, and cunning malice: Nor more infrequent, and less pardonable, Thro' vile submission to enjoyments sensual. Far have I wander'd,—now here, and now there, Glancing: but this was e'er allow'd to be The Muse's clear prerogative, and 'twere well If poetry were always as informal! Rapidity of movement, and of distant Objects the prompt association, makes One of the bard's most magic faculties. The flimsy trick of poetry to the ear And eye, and little to the intellect, May pass with fools and children—not the wise. Who loses all his days in seeking knowledge, Vain, empty, fill'd with windy vapour only, Might do as well in picking straws and pebbles. It puffs him up with self-sufficiency For what is worthless, and misleads the mind. It is the imagination and the reason, Which wanders over mind and matter, makes The majesty, and power, and use of genius: Not excellence in some one narrow class Of learning, or of art!—Thus Shakespeare's book, Above all others, is the universal Favourite of those who can the language read! Not ornate language, as the Laureat ever Well preaches to the world, can long delight,— More than we always can on sweetmeats feed. It is the thought,—the ore, and not the workmanship, Which gives the sterling value. Glittering words Soon tire and nauseate: they are baby's play! We cannot long read what is artificial: It is a natural eloquence, which bears us Onward without fatigue, or loss of interest. He, who is rich in mind intuitive, And well has cultur'd it, can never speak, But out he pours a stream of golden ore:— Some metal which may turn to useful coin. But ornamental trickery of poetry Is but a glittering shadow, for a moment That flashes, then deserts one, and expires. Thoughts multiply on thoughts, and words on words, When we retain the natural associations Of mental movements: if we interrupt them, To reassume them one by one is slow:— The tardiness of motion still augments, Till all is toil and artificiality. Not much will he advance upon his task, To whom it is a painful and dull labour. But after all that I, and all that men More eloquent and wise, have said, the Muse Will seem a trifler to a large proportion Of man's ungrateful race:—her fruits are thankless, And gain not favour, or respect, or smiles: But if her lessons be not sound and rational, And teach not as much wisdom as philosophers, Then let her be rejected and despised! Much have I travel'd on the grateful theme Of this strange land of waters and of mountains, Where the seventh part of my o'erclouded life I have taken my abode in age and sickness. No varnish'd story have I told; no sentiment Factitious utter'd: if exaggeration Is found in aught, let it be blotted out! But to be fervid, is not to exaggerate! Full many a mighty task, and many a care Have I impos'd upon myself, at peril Of mockery of a laughing thoughtless world;— Tasks which a long life would require to execute, When I am at its very termination! But innocent and wise are these delusions, That from us hide the day of our departure! Great questions in all States are moving now:— In Albion, above all! my stirring brain Cannot be tranquil on them. Parliament Well-constituted is the fount of right, Liberty, and security of person: And utterly the nation's wealth, and utterly The welfare of the Poor, on sapient laws Depends! and heartlessly and stupidly Have both by blind enactments been destroy'd. But will they wisdom in their new condition Hear? Ministers are rarely great in talent;— Still less in genius! Canning was rhetorical; But I am far from sure that he was wise!— The living I by name will not describe! O who are they that blow up the machinery Of produce, and then wonder it supplies not The nation's wants? who leave without employment The labourer to starve, while lands lie barren? Who plot the means to make him live in idleness At others' cost, while he might make returns For all that he consumes, and give a profit! Who can find stores to feed him improductively, Yet want the stores that he could well replace! Who can find means to send him cross th'Atlantic, In barbarous lands the native to expell, Far from his country, friends, and fond affections, At a most wasteful cost; yet want the store In toil productive to support his strength? O vile infatuation! when the barren Rock will repay due labour! when the fruit Is in proportion to the cost and art! This paper-money so misdeem'd as empty— Does it give food and task-work to the Poor, Whose fate it is by sweat of brow to live? Then how can it be empty, immaterial, And valueless? The food must co-exist, Or paper would have naught to act upon! But does it then to channels left untilled, And less conducive to the nation's welfare; Draw it? O no! the very obvious contrary:— It draws from none, because it reproduces:— Or even if it draw, it would from luxury And idleness to the deserving draw it! Delusions strange, because so clear and palpable! Ah! pruriency of law-making has been Among the sins or follies of the age! Each self-sufficient booby thinks himself A legislator wise and heaven-born. And thus we put chains on the things, whose essence Is freedom; and set free what should be bound. We force the labourer to be paid as charity The sustenance, which is the due return For what he has produc'd:—and then by strange Perversity of contradiction we Tell him he has a right to sustenance, And pay, without the recompense of labour. The poor laws, as they stand, are a device To rouse all parishes into fierce conflict, Each with the other, and to make the poor Footballs to be backward and forward kick'd From one place to the other, and to feed The law's most ravenous and blood-sucking minions. We take away the means for the employment Of those who live by labour, by the forceful Enactments of the Senate's interference: And then when they are madden'd to rebellion, And fire and blood, we punish them with death! We take away the means of the employers, Yet tell them that they must support the poor Without return of produce! We remove The check to population nature gives; And in its place an impulse false contrive: We force the augmentation, and extinguish, At the same moment, all the means to feed it: We multiply the taxes, and suppress In the same breath the instruments to pay them: We drive the people, under all the oppression Of artificial incumbrances, Back to the barbarous device of barter! And this the wisdom of a British Parliament! Of statesmen proud, and insolent, and high-bearing Of their own intellects the vain pretensions! But wisdom does not always with advancement Go in the thorny pathway of political Ambition, where by ruses and manœuvres The post is often won; where flowery words And smooth unmeaning voices,—miscall'd eloquence,— Enchant the air and ears, and win the race. Talent and virtue in the eyes of Government Avail but little: for the power of State Lies in the regions of Intrigue and Favour! He who is cloath'd in office, is deem'd wise, Tho ignorant, and tho by nature feeble. Thus boobies have the function to prepare, And pass, the rules that guide a nation's welfare. Hence these enormous wrongs in policy, Errors incredible, which plunge a people In misery, and gloom, and hate, and famine! Hence wealth, that is the sword, by which a kingdom Alone in modern days can warfare wage, Becomes exhausted, or its riches rather Buried in earth, and lost by suffocation: Our taxes to increase, and yet diminish Our riches, is insanity most hopeless. Not to augment our debt, but to augment Our means of payment, is the only chance To ease a nation from the load that stifles it. All payment from the same amount of income Is a delusion which but aggravates The evil;—drawing from the industrious And most productive, to enrich the drones. But statesmen ever busy in intrigues, And pressure of the troubles of the day, Cannot spare time to think, research, invent. Let but the day be struggled through,—enough Is done! and that which raises least discussion, And passes easiest with the multitude, Because it is most trite and most familiar, Is best with them, if least of toil it costs! And thus, as on Committees on Elections, “Knock out the brains, and then knock out the brains,” And all is well! and who are emptiest, And dread the beaten road, are favour'd most! To make a statesman and a legislator, Demands the mental faculties all high In their degree, and all in union, all Well cultivated, and in constant exercise, The dull incessant plodder will work blindly; And as he nothing of his way before him Sees, he will crush his head against a wall, Or sink into unfathomable pits; Or from the path direct go wide astray. Laws must be regulated well to suit Men's passions, habits, customs, and caprices. Imagination only can look inward, And see the movements of the human heart: The toils mechanical of office cannot Give it, nor arithmetical profoundness;— But it must be the lamp of genius, opening A prospect wide in a broad blaze of light. Thus am I ever ranging o'er the world, Taking my flight, O Leman, from thy banks! But once again,—(I cannot tell how often I have been straying,)—I return to thee! And here in quiet I my meditations Nurse; and with novel food my mind repair. I think upon the troubles, at a distance, Of policy which agitate my country: And though I sometimes wish to join the brawls, Yet cool reflection ever makes me bless The calmer scenes, more fitted to my age. I have not nerve for the turmoil and bustle Of rude, contentious, cavilling assemblies! But rather choose to ponder in the solitude, That opens nature's grandeur to my view. Here where I see Aurora drive away The billowy mists of vapour from the summits Of Alpine majesty, and spiral mountains Aspire to heaven, and in the solar rays Blazon their rude shapes,—from their craggy points Reflecting beams of tints innumerable,— Here from precipitous heights the deep blue wave Of Rhone I see into one common flood Fall with the Arve; then down through southern France Far to the sea its gather'd exit seek! Here to the East Helvetia's numerous craggs Gigantic, with variety of outline, That draw the clouds with every golden hue Fring'd, or transparent, raise the sight to rapture! Far from the stage, on which is play'd the drama Of busy life, should man, who has the means, The tranquil tenor of existence pass! Frail and deceitful are the glittering objects Of the world's passion: they cost dear, and win not The boon expected: not esteem, but calumny Too oft is the result: and if base lucre Because of choosing paths of proud ambition, It is the road of loss, and not of gain. But yet the grandeur and variety Of nature's scenery the common mind Leaves unaffected: mountains, roaring streams, And precipices, and blue spreading waters, And meads and woods and vallies, might awaken Genius e'en in the dull: but, ah, they leave The intellect in its own native state. The dweller in the mountains has not grander Thoughts, than the habitant of dirty streets! Excitement and collision are, perchance, Requisite to bring forward human faculties; And thus it is, the troubles of ambition Produce their own reward. We must not slumber Away this precious, labour-doom'd existence: And if we fall to idleness, the vapours Collect about our brains, and gradually The strength and fire extinguish. Silence thus, Or murmurs of the breeze, or lull of streams, Or song of birds, to tranquil sleep disposes us, And we are apt in motionless tranquillity To lose the hours to noble efforts destin'd. To give to rest its relish we must toil Hard; but without strong impulse who will rouse Himself from calm repose? And thus retirement, However in description it may shine, Is yet of doubtful preference. Learned Evelyn, Who wrote of woods and forests, and the nature Of trees, and gardening, and all sylvan pleasures, A little treatise against solitude Penn'd eloquently, while Mackenzie's pen, Who all his life in busy courts had spent, Pleaded for deep seclusion, books, and peaceful Self-entertainment.—So it is with man;— Never with his own destiny content! 'Tis when the mind is full, that Nature's scenery Works with a tenfold charm; for then it hangs Associations on each glittering object; And the redoubled stimulants experiences In all that round about it lives, and grows; Or motionless, or in its barren state Abides. The statesman, and the traveller, And he, who in the intellectual contests Of man's rivality, has thought and felt Much, and his brain has ever kept in movement, The more of wonder and magnificence In natural objects shews itself before him, Is more excited into lively flow Of the rich streams that circuit thro the mind; But he, who to corporeal labour bent, A life but little above animal Passes, no difference, perchance, may know Between a mountainous and dull flat country. And he who may be born amid gigantic Shapes of creation, by familiarity May lose the quickness of enraptur'd wonder At the sublimity display'd before him! Imagination has been represented A Sylvan Goddess, who in solitude Mid nature's grandeur holds her still abode: But she is immaterial, and regards not Embodied shapes, or the globe's substances. Yet atmospheres affect the spirit, when In earthly mould enclos'd, because it acts By aid of matter. Habitants, O Leman, Upon thy banks, of beverage celestial From Helicon's pure fountain ought to drink: But it would seem that strangers only drink it, And not thy natives!—Vain the scrutiny In Nature's secrets!—But Imagination The lamp of life's most precious knowledge is;— Of moral wisdom, and religious faith. All other science, all exact researches Into material qualities, are trifles Compar'd to this, which only genius can Penetrate, view, arrest, define, and paint. But stay my hand; and let my voice retain Its long-protracted breath,—lest I becoming Tedious, my lyre should cloy upon the ear! Naught of recondite has it forward brought; No novel tones, as censors will contend; But Memory at least has been awaken'd; And something of association new Been offer'd to the mind by sameness satiated. We know the borrow'd stores, that always travel In the same route, and in the same strict order Of method and alliance; words alone Chang'd for their synonimes as a thin disquise: But order new has something of the novelty E'en of a minor quality of invention. Should all the thoughts in language here recorded To all familiar be,—yet of sincere, And frank, and clear and simple, and withall Just, they may not be utter'd quite in vain. For by a sympathy we love to see Our own emotions in a mirror pass Shadow'd before us! A mantle all of gold begins again Invest the Eastern sky, and o'er the Alpine Summits mounts gradually higher and higher, Driving the billowy vapours all before it, And piercing them with dazzling rays. My task I reassume, that verges to its end. But short though it may be, my own may be Still shorter;—Simond, He died Saturday morning 2 July 1831, after a few hours illness. He was a man of acute, just, and intuitive talent. See his Tours in England, Switzerland, and Italy. by some years my junior, Is gone before me, e'en with scarce a warning: Death struck him in a moment; he had sense No more—scarce breathing thro a darksome night. Thus I may at this moment hold the pen, And be the next a lump of lifeless clay. And yet I meditate a thousand projects, As if I had a length of days before me! Tombs of the Bards in ten long books have I With hope insane for future task design'd. O ye, who mock me for my vain creations Of airy castles, and impossible wishes, Who see me with my snow-white locks, and wrinkled Features, and step infirm, and shaking hand, And tell me of the grave, to which alone I ought to turn my eyes, and thoughts, and feelings, You are as stupid, as you are hard-hearted! Your voices are but whistling wind to me,— As empty and as forceless, as discordant! While I a few choice spirits can engage, And Wordsworth, Southey, Lockhart disapprove not, Those sarcasms only on themselves return! If mid the cares, that like a thousand vultures Prey on my heart, I can the moments soothe By occupations innocent, no crime, Or folly, surely is in the indulgence. He, who expects too much from human nature, Does but suppress the little it can do. Hypocrisy, or stupor, is the consequence Of the perfidious counsel thus obtruded. But Gibbon wisely said, that he who could not Counsel himself, was but a broken reed, That every wind could blow away to atoms! Thus for the first six books did I perform Uninterruptedly my morning task: For 'twas the morning, tho the task begun The first hours after midnight's sound was heard: In seven and twenty days the work was done. Between 23 May and 18 June, 1831. Shall I repent it? Much is there combin'd, I never else had brought together: much Of thought and sentiment I never else Had from my mind evok'd.—The clock strikes one! Deep and distinctly from the town it comes: And I must throw the dews of sleep away. But now Written 5 July, 1831. again by some strange new caprice Of intellect, its paces and its flights Are slow; and I with labour this the last Part of my long performance execute. Who ventures in the public eye to act, Or meditate, or shew his sensibility, Must for malignant censure be prepared. Envy, and jealousy, and consequent Detraction, are the actuating passions Of man;—yet strangely oft do we admire In secret those whom openly we criticise; And by degrees is approbation won, Or else extorted from th'unwilling heart! Shall we in silence and in stupor pass Our days, for fear of cavil and detraction? The storms, that buffet us, but stronger make us, And animate our faculties to actions: Defiance is sometimes a noble feeling. Few are the cheers, that through a troubled life Have borne me onward:—my reliance then Has been on the indignant impulses Rous'd by ungenerous and wrongful blows. Then it is said, that I am querulous, And ever of my injuries am prating! Defiance and complaint have not a tone Of sympathy: complaint for pity calls, And breathes not battle. I am more inclin'd To think that indignation is my tone! But it is said, we must not talk of self, For good or bad, for pity or for anger. Yet if the knowledge of internal movement Be the prime lesson, whence with so much certainty Can we the picture of another's bosom Describe as of our own?—It is the cavil Of that disparagement, which blackens life! There are, who will deny there is a difference In native gifts of mind; but think apparent Superiority is accidental, Or flows from labour, or is mere pretence. And all,—that they may rob it of the honour; And love, esteem, respect, applause withhold. But all of real excellence is genius;— Not art, or labour. From the springs of mind It comes unborrow'd: but it must be aided, And warm'd by suns,—by exercise and culture Unveil'd!—Or “in the deep unfathom'd cave The gem will buried lie!” For Genius never The treasure at the bottom knows, till tried. Johnson profoundly said, “with the necessity Comes the ability!” 'Tis so with genius! Necessity cannot create the power;— But only draw it forth. The genuine strength Survives the grave, and hovers o'er the tomb! The fame, that was in life deserv'd, is green, And flourishing, after the lapse of ages. The language of true genius ne'er decays, Nor obsolete becomes; and each one sees Something peculiar to himself, which others Have not deliver'd, nor, perchance, e'en thought! The fruits of genius by repeated reading Ne'er become stale and common-place: a living Fire in them dwells; and vigour to the last, As in a green old age, pervades their veins. But never must the exercise relax The constant discipline; the constant effort. Genius, the more it writes, it writes the better; But toil and industry, without the gifts Of nature, fade, grow duller, and exhaust. Books multiply beyond the utmost reach Of man's attention; but unborrow'd thoughts, And flames by art unlighted, are most rare. And 'twould be well, were groaning shelves discumber'd Of artifice, and nauseous repetitions: Whence precious time is lost in seeking ore, Where nothing can be found but dross and staleness. There is no torment greater than a stupor:— 'Tis not tranquillity;—it is despair! Then every object in horrific tints Displays itself;—and comfort is in naught. Then mind and frame are motionless, except Beneath the writings of disgust and agony. And thus the mind will be, that, form'd for effort And unfatigued activity, is idle. The fogs, that settle on it, breed disease, That like a demon sits upon the heart! Thus ever must I travel, and my faculties Keep in incessant motion, which the more They work, are buoyant more, and more elastic. And thus with deep regret, and sighs and tears, I backward look on years that I have lost; Discourag'd with a mean and criminal cowardice, By censure, or neglect, or cold reception;— Which ever fortitude, and manliness, Should breast, and rise against with proud disdain. The world by pulling others down suppose That they can raise themselves into their places: And finding fault they think a proof of talent, And that themselves the work could better do. Affected scorn is the prevailing tone Of visage, that upon the multitude Of human countenances holds the sway; Or heartless ridicule, or stern aperity. And now, ye Waters, glittering in the sun In tints of deepest azure, from the theme Of your majestic beauties I must part. Be silent now, my Lyre, till thou beginnest Another chosen subject. Who will hear thee, I hail with joy, and tears of gratitude;— Who will reject thee, with tranquillity, Now I am old and philosophic grown, I leave to their own tastes, and harsher judgments!
