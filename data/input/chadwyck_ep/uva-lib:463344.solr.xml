TO MY MOST DEERE AND dread Soveraigne Iames by the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, be all heavenly and earthly happinesse. Thoughts, fight no more, but now (with Wits accord) Yeeld al obedience to Arts rightest rule; Then, like a constant treble-twisted cord, Binde vp the sweet'st affections of my Soule, And, in a Poesy giue them to, O no, They are too base for such high Eccellence! Yet (prostrate) giue them to him, and say so; So, I may shunne dislike, you, insolence: Great (ó too narrow is this name for thee) King, (yet too straite a stile for thy great worth) And Monarch, (this with it doth best agree) Deigne to accept a Base base Wit brought forth: And base it is (great Highnesse) in each line, Because indeede it is too rightly mine. His Maiesties lesse then least, and most vnworthy Subiect: Iohn Davies. To the sacred Queene of Englands most excellent Maiestie. If those VVombs blessed be, from whom proceedes A world of blessings to the VVorld accurst; Or if that gracious be, that Graces breedes, To make Men gracious, being at the worst; O then how blest and gracious is thy VVombe, Deere Daughter, Sister, VVife vnto a King! Wherein Heaven wrought (as in a sacred roome) Strong Props of peace, which blest Time forth did bring. Vnto a Mother-maide we all are bound, For bringing forth our Soules preservatiue; Who, for the same, is Queene in Heaven Crownd: And, sith thou bring'st our Corpes conservatiue, We must crown thee in Earth, or els, we should Doe otherwise then Saints &amp; Angels would. Your Highnesse most humbly devoted Vassall. Iohn Davies. The vvhole Ile of greate Brittaine vvas of yore divided into 13. Kingdoms, as by Monuments of antiquity, and Historie (the vvitnesses of time) appeareth. viz. England into 8. namelie, Kent, South-Saxons, East-Saxons, VVest-Saxons, Bernnicia, (aliàs Northumberland) Deira, (or Southumberland) Est-Angles, Mercia. Scotland into 2. viz. Scottes, &amp; Picts; The Scottes on the VVest side, the Picts on the East, called Pictl?d, as the other, Scotland. VVales into 3. viz. North-wales, Southwales, and Povvys-land. Vppon vvhich Plaine-songe thus I descant. [An Articke Ile there is (most famous) found] An Articke Ile there is (most famous) found In the great Lavor of this lesser Round, Which Neptunes hand (as most esteemd) infolds And in his vnsweet-sweating bozome holdes, On whom at once, Heavens providence begate Thirteene Kinges, which did her participate; Shee fedd them sweetlie, made them fatte to grow; For, from her Brest did Milke and Hony flow: Who being pampred, so, ambitious made, Gainst Nature gan each other to invade: Shee greatly griv'd, they quited so her loue; And ay to make them one, shee oft did proue: But (froward) at the least, they would be Twoo, So lived long (in strife) with much adoo: Yet like a tender Mother (vext to see That hir deere children could no better gree) Shee laboured night and day with Tyme, to doe That which shee tride, but could not bring them to: Who (both togither ioyn'd) did them attone, So, Tyme and shee, (at last) haue made them One. Then if in One, Thirteene vnited be, How great, how glorious, and how good is hee? Iohn Davies. ÆNIGMA. A treble paire, doth our late wracke repaire, And sextiplies our mirth, for one mishappe; These six, as hopes, to keepe vs from dispaire, (When clappes wee feard) were sent vs at a clappe: That we might clapp our hands in his high praise, That made vs, by our Heads losse, much more faire, And vs beheaded, so, our Head to raise: One headlesse, made all looke as blacke as Hel, All headlesse makes the Head and all looke well. SPHINX. If this a Riddle be, then so be it, Yet Truth approues what therein hid doth lie, And Truth's most louelie in the Eye of VVit When she is rob'd with richest misterie: In few, by losse we haue gott benefitt, That's, six for one, by lawfull vserie: Then, if we gaine by losse, our losse is gaine; So saith France, Fl?ders, Scotland, Irel?d, Spaine. To the iudicious Reader. Thou seest this great VVorld (Reader) &amp; perch?ce Thine Eie is cloid with often seeing it; Then see the Lesse with noe lesse circumstance, And with VVittes Eie, that Monarchy of VVitte. Microcosmos. The Heav'ns and Earth, do make the greater VVorld; And Soule and Bodie, make the Lesse (we prove:) The Heav'ns doe moue the Earth, &amp; they are whirld By Him, that makes the Soule, the Body moue. Primus Moto. Who conquers it (at least) are Monarchs great, Greater then those that conquered the greater; For, from their goodnesse Men their greatnes gette, And they are best, that doe subdue the better: Prover. 16 32. The great VVorld's good, but better is the least: Things living though never so small, are better then liveles things, though never so great. Then view it, to subdue it, thou wert best. Iohn Davis. A Request to the Cittie of Hereford. Deere Mother, in whose Wombe my vitall flame Was kindled first by the Almighties breath, Lend me thy name, to adde vnto my name, That one, with other, may keepe both from death: Vnto thy conscience I (poore I) appeale, Whether or no, I haue deserved it; My conscience telles me I haue sought thy weale With al my skill, my will, my woorth, my witte. Iudge God, iudge good men, iudge my truth herein, Impartiall Iudges you shall iudge for me; If so, my soule is fear'd, or I haue bin (Deere Mother) what I now would seeme, to thee: Eph. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.And doe confesse, though vnkinde Parents proue, Yet are their children bound to seeke their loue. Iohn Davies of Hereford. [Mirum in modum, Men did wonder-maze] Mirum in modum, Men did wonder-maze, Which wonderment, this later worke of thine (Not by detracting from it) doth deface. How so? by giving out a greater shine: The soules Horizon that made light whil-ere, But this inlightens her whole Hemispheare. Blest be thou Sunne fr? wh?ce this light doth spring And blessed be this little World of light By which who walkes, perforce must be a King, King of a little World, in Fortunes spight; For force, and vertue, in the soule doe sitte, And they doe raigne that ruled are by it. Th? raigne thou in Mens thoughts, thou thoughtful Soule, Whil'st thy rare Worke among their Workes shall raigne; For, it in passion, passion doth controule, Then mightie is thy grace, thine Arte, thy paine: As thou for writing faire art most renownd, So, writing thus, thou must be Lawrell cround. Iohn Iames To the Author. Mans soule (th' Idea of our Makers mould) Whiles it doth harbour in this house of clay, Is so ore-whelm'd with passions manifold, Is so ore-throwne with Adams olde decay: That much like bastard Eagle, dimme of sight, It dares not take a view of Reasons light. O then, redoubled thankes deserues thy VVorke, Whose Verse Prometheus-like striues to enflame That sacred Sparke, which in our Soules doth lurke, Giving blinde Reason eies to see the same: Davies, thine Arte beyond our Arte doth reach, For thou each Soule, soule-humbling Arte dost teach: Thus Oxford Artists are oblig'd to thee, Who, Stork-like building heere a while thy Nest, For Earthly Lodge dost leaue an heav'nly fee, Giving a Sword to kill that foe of Rest, Faire learnings blott, which Scollers know to well, I mean, Self-loue, which thy Self-arte doth quell. Dovglas Castilion. Vpon Master Iohn Davies, Beginning his Discoverie of the litle VVorld with a Preface vnto the most high and mightie Prince Iames the first King of England &amp;c. So, ere he dare adventure on the Maine, The prudent Sailoure prostrate on the shoare Makes first his vovves vnto the Castor and Pollux. swan-bred Twaine, And their aspect religiously implores: So, ere vnto the Ocean he sets-forth, Who is this lesse Worlds great Discouerer, He turns his eies vnto the hopefull North, And viewes the Cynosure that shineth there. Auspicious Star, at whose divine arise Earth did put of her saddest maske of Night, Shine mildely on him, who beholdes thine Eies, As sole directors of his course aright. So that the great world may the lesse world see By that faire Light he borrowed first of thee. Vpon the Discoverie of the litle VVorld By Master Iohn Davies. Goe Drake of England, Christoph. Columb. Doue of Italie, Vnfolde what ever Neptunes armes infolde, Travell the Earth (as Phœbus doth the skie) Till you begette newe Worlds vpon this olde. Would any wonders see, yet liue at rest, Nor hazard life vpon a dangerous shelfe? Behold, thou bear'st a World within thy brest, Take ship at-home, and sayle about thy selfe. The shippe wherein Sir Fr. Dra. compassed the World.This Paper-Bark may be thy Golden-Hinde, Davies the Drake and true discou'rer is, The end, that thou-thy-selfe thy-selfe maist finde; The prize and pleasure thine, the trauell his: See here display'd, as plaine as knowledge can, This litle World, this wondrous Ile of Man. Charles Fitz-Ieffry. To the Reader. Beyond the reach of vulgar intellect, Inbred by Nature, but refin'd by Art, Doth wisdomes Heyre this monument erect, Grace't with what ere the Graces can impart. Here, Wits not soild with looser blandishment. The Subiect pure, abstruse, and worthy paine, Annatomizing civill government, And, of the Soule what Reason can attaine. The many sweetes herein contained be, Epitomiz'd, would aske too large Narration To be compris'd within this narrow station. Reade then the VVorke: when, if thou canst not see Th'infolded flame; be rapt with admiration, But censure not: for, Owles haue bleared eies, Dazled with every Starre that doth arise. To the Booke as it is dedicated vnto his most excellent Maiestie. Thrise happy Issue, brain-begotten Birth, Wits pure Extraction, life of Poesie, Togither borne with Englands endlesse mirth; How haue the Heauens grace't thy nativity! Wast from disdaine to powre th'ambrosian dew (Dropping like Nectar from a sacred quill) Into the common Lavour, vulgar view; That Heaven deferd thy birth these howres vntill? O blessed Booke, reserv'd to kisse that hand, From which, desert nere parted discontent! Go, pay thy vowes; await his dread command To whom in prostrate duety thou art sent. Shall He say, liue? flie Time; swell Lethe lake; Burst fell Detraction; thou liu'st: and when A thousand Ages dust shall over-rake, Thy living Lines shall please both God, and men: For, grace't by him, whom swift intelligence Hath made Arch-Master of each excellence, It needes must follow, that succeeding daies Cannot detract from what he dain'd to praise. Nicholas Deeble. [To praise thee, beeing what I am to thee] To praise thee, beeing what I am to thee, Were (in effect) to dispraise thee, and mee: For, who doth praise himselfe, deserves dispraise; Thou art my selfe, then thee I may not praise: But this, in Nature, may I say by Arte, Thine Arte, by Nature, makes thee what thou art. Your louing Brother and worst part of your selfe Richard Dauies A Preface in honor and devotion vnto our most puissant, and no lesse roially-accomplished Soveraigne, Iames by the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, &amp; Ireland, defender of the faith, &amp;c.

His precious Ueines doe flow with our deer'st bloud; 2. Sam. 5. 1. Bone of our bones, Flesh of our Flesh, is he: If he by vs, then, should haue beene withstoode, We had withstoode our selues; and cursed bee The band that with the head doth disagree. Beyond his birth, he was a Kinge, in right, And borne to beare rule, in the high'st degree, Whose hand and head endowed are with might Scepters and Crownes to weld, and weare aright. And giue we her, her due, that now is gone, Who had in her a World of Princely Parts: Yet shee hath left her World, and Worth to one Thats Master of himselfe, and of the Arts Which Art, and Nature, but to Kings impartes: And as this Queene was oft from death preserv'd When in his Iawes he had got all her partes; So was this King from like distresse conserv'd, And both (no doubt) for Englands life reserv'd. And right well worthy of the Crowne is hee, Were it more deere then Cæsars Diadem (When envious World did him her Monarch see) That never did molest our Queene, and Reame, That might with bloud, for bloud, haue made it streame: That God that tenders all that tender bloud Blesse him and his for it, and make his Stemme Yeeld many Branches, that may ever bud, And bring sweete fruit, for Scottish-Englands good. Much Bloud, though drawne from Heavens vnholy foes, Seemes irksome (if not loathsome) to their sight: For, when iust David thought their Arke t'inclose Within a Temple, with all glory dight, (Which hee (in zeale) meant to erect outright) Hee was forbad by Heav'ns most holy One For making Bloud to flow (though in their right) And that Taske put on peacefull Salomon: 2. Sam. 7. 2. 13. Then peacefull be thy Raigne (deare Lord) alone To build the Temple of true Union. But, though our Bloud were thus deere in thine Eies (More deere then Gold, although a double Crowne) Yet did our feare thy E: A: Loue with care surprize And bee'ng our owne, we vs'd it as our owne; For, safe we kept it, as to thee its knowne: We lou'd thee so, as still we fear'd thy powre, For, if a wren from vs to thee had flowne, We (as supposing that hee ment to towre) Would keepe him safe, for loue and feare, in Towre. Deere King, drade Sov'raigne, sacred Maiesty, And what stile els, a mortall state may beare, We, truely English, doe but liue to die For thee, for that thou (stirred) didst not steere Thy powre against our peace; but didst indeere Vs to thee, by thy peerelesse patience showne, True token of thy loue-begotten care Of vs and ours; as if that loue alone Had held our losse of bloud (as tis) thine owne. Had not our blouds beene precious in thine Eie, Thou mightst (perhaps) haue made vs buy it deare Or made thee heire apparant publikely, As Iustice would; but crost by private feare: Stories swarme with Examples, farre, and neere, That many further off, and of lesse force To catch at Crownes, would heires thereto appeere, Or pull of Crownes and heades of them perforce, That, wearing Grownes, crost their vnblessed course. But thou (to thy true glory be it said) Though having hands of powre to reach a Crowne Thou didst thy selfe containe, and praid, and staid, Till now in peace thou haste it for thine owne; And still may thee and thine by it be knowne: That Scots, and English, no more may be two, But made, by true-loues artlesse Art, all one, As Nature hath made vs, and Contry too, Both which to vnitie vs both doe woo. So neighbour Nations seeing our concent Shall stand in awe of our vnited powr's; And (of our friendshippe glad) shall vs present With precious gifts, and all that loue alures; So all, as friends, while friends we are, is ours: And may hee bee a terror made to all, That twixt vs the least discontent procures; And as a Monster most vnnaturall, Let odious bee his damn'd memoriall. If wee, when wee were but halfe, what we are, And had a woman to our soveraigne, Were able all foes at their dores to dare, VVhat may we doe, when over vs doth raigne A kingly King, and one Realme made of twaine? If ever therefore twixt our Fathers were (That now are rakt in dust) cause to complaine, Let it be rakt with them, for wee are cleere From wronging each, and each to other deere. Both subiect to one Soveraigne, then draw wee Togeather kindlie in subiections Yoke; God, and our King will ioy, if wee agree, But greive, if we each other shal provoke, And make vs feele their wrathes resistlesse stroke: Then dwell in our harts, for ioyes cordiall (VVhich nothing but your sorowes can revoke) Haue made them large ynough to hould you all, Prov. 27. 19.And lend vs yours, to doe the like with all. Call for them when yee will, they shalbe yours, Togither with the Tenaunts harbred there: But take our harts, for now they are not oures, But yours for ever, let vs then endeere Vs to you ever, who are to vs deere: My voice, though base, to highest Concord tends, Then tis in tune (I trust) to ev'ry Eare: If it be harsh, my hart shall make amendes, For it doth relish Loue which nere offends. Then weigh our Prince (our Peace) with Uprightnesse, And presse him to no more then that will way, For, (if not too perverse) we must confesse Our best requests sometimes may haue a nay Wee may not aske God why he (somtimes) denies our requests; but because hee is as good, as wise, suppose it is for the best: no more ought wee a wise &amp; good King, &amp;c. For better ends; which he may not bewray: It is no ease for one two friends to please VVhen both, perhapps, doe but for one thing praie: Then die, ô die ere once him so displease, As to vrge that, that may his hart disease. O that I had a Soule-enchanting Tongue, That with an Eare-bewitching violence I might persuade to all that doth belong To perfect Loue, and true obedience; Sith our felicitie must flow from thence: If so it be, then nought the VVill can moue To loue, if obiects of such excellence cannot allure the Mind and Will to loue, As the felicitie which now we prove. Our King comes not to our late barren Crowne Himselfe alone, but brings a fruitfull Queene, And (Englands comfortes) children of their owne, By which the state ay stablisht may be seene; Then blest are wee, if ere wee blest haue beene: O let vs then blesse him whose blessednesse Hath (when our sinnes expected sorrowes keene) Preserv'd vs both from warres, and wretchednesse; And let vs loue, in Soule, and singlenesse. Giue vs your Daughters, and take ours in marage, That, Blouds so mixte, may make one flesh, and bloud; We will not yours, then doe not ours disparage, But ballance all by woorth, and Liuely-hood, By Vertue, Beauty, and what ere is good: Each bend his wittes, and all his industrie, To make all one in body, minde, and mood: Then God will blesse all, bent to vnity, And plunge vs all, in all felicity. If Concord makes of weake, most mightie things, And Discord of most mightie, things most fraile; If subiects peace, and glorie be the Kings, And their Disgrace, and strife his disavaile; Then ô let my weake words strongly prevaile To strongest peace, (that makes weak'st weaknesse strong) Then, nought shall dare our daring peace t'assaile, Eccl. 4. 9.But we shall right th'oppressed Neighbours wronge, And make them holde their owne, as we doe, longe. As when a humane-flesh-fedd Caniball Hath singled out some weakling, for a Pray, And by the power of some Knight (armed all), Is sker'd (at point to feede) with skath away: So from th' opprest, we shall oppressors fray; And be as Gods Liuetenants, heere belo, To see his highest iustice done each way, Prov. 24. 11.That Heau'n by vs may make the Earth to kno We are Heau'n-holpe, to helpe all wronged so. Whiles Myne, and Thyne, did disvnite our Crownes (Two things for which, the Sire and sonne will iarre) There was some cause, sometimes, of secret frownes, That ended too too oft with open warre; But now both We, and They vnited are; And, surely to sustaine that double Crowne, Fiue Proppes we haue, (Ambition so to barre) Made of each others substance, so, our owne, Then what remaines but still to loue, as One. The Lion to the Dragon's reconcil'd, That whilome did vpon each other feede; Ierusalem hath David (erst exild) Free denized, &amp; King proclaim'd with speede; Whose Members dance for ioy of that iust deede: 2. Sam. 6. 14. Hir King is now, according to his Hart VVhich, with, saue goodnesse, nothing is agreed; He is a King in all, and in earth part, By bloud (without bloud) Nature, Minde, and Arte. Fortune that crost the will, and worke of Nature For many yeares, hath now made her amends By making vs, (as we are) one, in nature, And of vnfaithfull foes, most faithfull friends: That Hand on whose direction all depends (Disposing Crownes and Kingdomes as it lists) Hath made vs one, I hope, for endlesse endes: Then curst be he that Heau'n herein resists; And blest be him that it therein assists. And, though I be no Seer, yet let mee (Out of my darke foresight in things future) Speake like a Seer, that can such things see That may be seene without the seeing pow'r, And their like, seene of blind men ev'ry howr: If sinne crosse not the course of Heau'n herein, Our Land (that flowes with Hony, Milke, and Floure) Shall be an Earthlie Paradice, wherein Plentie, and Peace shall woo from, and to sinne. But Plenty, like an Eaue-enticing Snake, Shall tempt vs with the Eye-delighting frute Of all voluptuousnes, which if wee take, There is a powr that can our fortunes sute VVith Adams, when hee Eadon was cast out; And, with stil-sweating sorrow-furrowed Browes, To liue, or begge, or starve if we be mute: For nought hath roote so fast, or gaily growes, But Heau'ns least puffe extirpes, and overthrowes. O tis perfection next to that of Gods, When Men are compast with all sensuall sweetes, Then, then, to make the Will to know the odds Betwixt that sweete that lasts, and this that fleetes, And so restraine harts ioy when pleasure greetes: An abiect Slaue will glutt his greedie Maw A noble and good hart will haue consideration of his meate &amp; diet.VVith what so ere his Sense with sweete regreetes, If he can snatch it, but great Myndes withdraw Their Wills from such base blisse, by Glories law. Eccl. 30. 25.A Beare will breake her Belly, if shee may, So hoony be the meane to doe the deede: And so will Men-beares doe, as well as thay, If they catch hoonied sweetes, themselues to feede; VVho make it their Minds laboure onely meede: Basse humane Beasts, how senselesse is your sense That will gainst sense and Reason so exceede! Base is your minde, worse your intelligence, Odious to God, and vnto Men offence. Eccl. 10. 17.If Landes are saide to flourish, and reioyce Vnder new Kinges, though oft worse then the old, How may this Land, as if shee had made choise Of hir Liege Lord, (that now the same doth hold) For vertue onely, ioy him to infold! If Soules extreame ioy makes the Body dance, (VVittnesse sweete Psalmist) then, deere Liege, behold Thy subiects iesture at thine enterance, And be assur'd they besse this blessed chance. And see how Vertue pulls to, and putts fro, Note Simil.Like to the Load-stone whose North-point attracts And South-point putts off, what the North pulls to: So thou (North-point) by right and vertuous Acts Dost draw our Crowne, and vs to thee contracts: And those, South from thee (that in show might draw) By Vertue mou'd (as loathing bloudie facts) Put off the Crowne, (before their head it saw) To thee, whose vertue breedes their loue and awe. See, see how Mother Natures totall Body Doth (as inspired with a second Soule) Exult to see thee weare the Crowne vnbloudy! See how the Orbes of Heav'n doe slowly roule To slacke Times course, which they for thee controule! The hoast of starres, with Sol their soveraigne, Fight, all aspects malitious to ore-rule: The Elements renew their force againe, To blesse with plentie, thy thrice-blessed raigne. Our Fields, are clad in three-pil'd Greene in Graine, (Three pil'd for thicknesse that none sees the Ground: In Corne. Graine which no Lænd can (for goodnesse) staine; Like ioyfull Sommer-Queenes, they thus are gound To see their King (by whom they flourish) cround: VVho will for thee such larges throw about (VVith open hand) that Beggars shall abound VVith fill of Bread; yea all the land throughout Shall glut her Children with Milke, Flowre, and Frute.

No Beast, nay not the Asse (though nere so dull) But in his voice (though vnarticulate) Salutes these times, and vp their spirites pull: So, Airie, and Watrie Flockes congratulate Thy fortune blest, to staie this sincking state. No Beast is backward in this common ioy, But the slowe Oxe; and hee with open Throte Complaines, for that Men will him now imploy More then before; yet tunes a doubtfull Note That none may him directly grieved note: For, he (though nere so blunt of wit and sprite) Cannot but know (except hee can but dote) That his whole Tribe might haue beene bucherd quight To feede huge Hosts, if thou hadst not thy right. Our Houndes and Haukes, with Spaniels them among, Togither drue their Heads, so to decree (VVith Triumph such as to them doth belong) How th'one should runne, and crie, the other flea To sport their King, for their Sportes libertee. They fear'd their game had beene expired quight, And that their owne decay they soone should see; For no flesh comes amisse t'a hungry wight The person that is ful despiseth an hony-combe but vnto the hungry Soules (as hunger-bitt? Soldiers) every bitterthing is sweete. Prov. 27. 7.That hunts for Flesh for neede, not for delight. The Rivers, dallying with their beautious Banckes VVith voice of comfort, whisper in their Eares That Swans shall decke them now, not Soldiers Rancks; Swans, whose sweete Songs, shall banish cares and feares, And both ioy-drown'd do interchange sweete Teares: Each silver Prill gliding on golden Sand Transmuted so, by these new golden yeares, Oreflowne with ioy, doth laugh vpon the Land; VVhich as with blisse entraunct, amaz'd doth stand. The senslesse Trees, with sense of ioy past Ioy, Send, through their Buff-skyn Barks, their iuyce in Teares; VVhich ere they fall, blithe Nature doth imploy In Buds, and Blossoms, so that each appeares Smiling on all, and Roabes of Triumph weares: So, all doe weepe and laugh, and laughing weepe That earth (the Iade of Elementals) beares; And as an holy-day, this yeare doth keepe, Drownd in a Sea of hoonied pleasures deepe. The Seasons of the yeare in councell sate, VVhich of the fow'r thee first should entertaine; VVho all decreed the Spring (as chiefe in state) Should welcome in thy comming hereto raigne, And decke our Triumphes for our Soveraigne. Among the Monthes, March was thereto assign'd Yet hee refus'd, till hee his puffes restrain'd, And having spent his spight, to wit, his winde, In fine, he welcomes thee in mildest kinde.

Neptune now hugs his Darlinge in his Armes, (This Queene of Isles) lest that his Tridents sway Should bee made subiect to her Sceptred Armes, So, flatt'ring, seekes to shunne his feared harmes.

Looke in the studies of the younge, and old, Their wonted studies wee shall changed see, For now the Muse their beades (deere harts) doth hold, The while their hands are making lines agree To meate their ioy, that cannot measur'd be: Happy is he that can light on one line That may expresse (and kisse it for a fee) The thousandth part of what his hart doth line, Namely that ioy, that no name can define.

And those that breake out, come but stumbling out Nay, cannot stand, without some others stay: So, one each other stay in stumbling doubt, And yet no one can well his doubts bewray, For doubt he doth, say what his friend can say: He doubts his Lines may be (for Loue or hate) Led to his Liege, that can all faults display; Hee doubts their worth, and (carefull) doubts their fate, So Doubts distresse his thoughts, oppresse his Pate.

And who hath held their Pens from blott of blame And ever kept their Muse immaculate, Their conscience now takes comfort in the same, As if some God were come, (that Uice doth hate) VVith Grace their virtue to remunerate: As when the Kinge of Kings shall come at last To giue all Men their meede, in righteous rate, The good alone roioyce in their liues past: So perfect Poets now must comfort tast.

Tim. 6. 15. Rom. 19. 16. Kinges high Way: No Sentence, Line, Clause, VVord, or Syllable Therein contain'd, but doth pure thoughts bewraie: Then, sith thy Minde is to it semblable, No Earthly King is to thee sutable. Never was Piety with Policy So well compounded in the Head of State: The Serpents wisedome many Snakes apply To Sores of Kinges Simplicity, but hate The Doue-like innocence, as out of date. If Piety, and Policy doe iarre (As some suppose) then can we bee s'ingrate As not to crowne him that did end the warre? Nor be compos'd by such a Temperer? For, if from Hartes abundance Mouthes disperse Uertue or Uices Mammon all abroade, What may we deeme thee th? that did'st reherse. Such precepts, as beseem'd a Semi-God, How best the Sonne should beare an Empires Lode (Which weakenesse oft, back-broken, vndergoes) We needes must weene that Vertue makes abode (As in her home) in thy Hart, sith it floes VVith goodnesse like Gods, to thy Friends, &amp; Foes. How like a Lord of thy selfe do'st thou striue To conquer Passion (Princes great'st disease) In him that likely is thee to survive? And, as an old tride Sea-man tells at Seas VVhat Rocks and Flatts a yong one may displease Ere first he setts out, that he them may shunne: So, from thy proofe (for thy Succeeders ease Thou tell'st him (ere to rule he hath begune) What Compasse he should keep, safe Course to run. For Empire is a Sea most faire to see, But perillous to proue, as they best kno That all their life-long to it bounden be, Subiect each Tyde to be orewhelm'd with woe, If not to wracke and finall overthro: Wherein thou dost thy course so wisely guide That like a skilful Pilot thou dost sho (By demonstration) how this Sea t'abide And safely saile, or else at Ancor ride. Then, ô how blessed is this blisful Ile VVhose God is Loue, whose King is Vertues Host, VVhose Grace and VVisdome (with an holy guile) Doth catch the Least and binds them to him most, As to their Piller, and vpholding Post! VVho makes his Subiects great, as good, as great By his example, without Checke, or cost, And to vnequalls equal Law doth meate With Loues right h?d, which stil doth hate defeate! The Fire, as be'ng the noblest Element, Is plac'd, by Natures hand, aboue the rest; That, by it's actiue vertue prevalent, It might repurifie the worst, and best, That be inferior, or in lesse request: So thou art iustly plac'd (in Natures right) Aboue the great'st, that with thy vertue least Canst purge them from their greatest vices quight, And make them shine, through thy high vertues light. Such Kings should be obaid, and glory-cround, Because their Vertues al mens else exceede: For, they that are in all abundance drownd, Yet, let no more in, then may Nature feede, And spare the rest for those that haue more need, O! these are rightly Fames Superlatiues, (Gods vpon Earth, that's Kings like Gods in deede) From whom the subiect vertue high derives, VVhose liues are Lights to lead obscurer liues. And, Vertue in a King is more of price, Then in a poore man, though most vertuous, For Kings haue more meanes to be drawn to Vice, And may, without controle, be vicious; But poore-men, not, for Want, and Summumius: If Sol would Venus vse, what Starre comes not At becke, wel-neere, too neere to him, to vse? But if a naked poore Snake be so hott He may be coold, but so be coold, cannot. What glory gettes constrain'd Sobrietie (If glorie gotten be by Vertue right) Constrain'd b'imperious Necessitie, Other, then to be chast for want of might In Purse, or Parts, or all the Bodie quight? VVhere's no Foe to oppunge what conquest ist? But where be many great Ones, there to fight, And with a Kingly courage them resist, O such an one is a true Martialist! How easie this is sedd, who doth not see? How Arte may picture Vertue, all perceaue; But to inspire hir with vitalitee, This none but onely Gods haue powr to geue, From whom alone shee doth her life receaue. O, deere Liege, that I could, as faine I would, Make Vertue lively; then by thy good leave, Thou should'st not leave me (wretch) sith then I could Leaue all the World to serue thee, as I should. Then would I with a never vvearied Eye Help thee to watch from wolues thy Flocke to keepe: Thy Flocke is great, and Wolues may lurcking lye In each darke Corner to devoure thy Sheepe: But blest were he that would, &amp; could dive deepe Into th' Abisse of ev'ry darke device, (While thou gav'st Nature necessarie sleepe) To feele their Psa. 64. 45. 6. Snares to catch, &amp; Lures t'intice, So, make them knowne that would thee preiudice. Diue, diue, to Hell blacke Hels inhabitants (Children of darkenesse that envie our light) Albion's no place for such blacke Miscreants, For God, and Man, there, with (not for) you fight: Then, doe your selues ensconse in endlesse night; These stand vpon your guard, guarded with Fiends, That guard &amp; grieue you, both at once, with spight; There shall yee feele smart of Gods fingers ends, Sith divine Iustice deeper nere descends. Deere Loue, sweet Lord goodnes-surmounting God, How stands this Land oblig'd vnto thy loue! This little-great Land, or great-little Clod Thou more regard'st (it seemes) th? heav'n aboue; 2. Pet. 2. 4.For there thou plaguedst sinne, as Angels proue: But, though this Isle doth flote on seas of sinne, Thou, mou'd with loue, fr? it dost plagues remoue, As if against the streame thou wouldst it winne To perfect goodnesse, and to rest therein. O bow our Harts of steele, make them well bent, That they may through thy hart shoot shafes of loue, And wound the same with loue most violent: But what neede that, sith now the same we proue? But yet, sith thou such shooting dost approue, And, by thy lawes, alone its lawfull game, Let all the shafts of our indevors roue At thy harts whitest loue, sith in the same Consists our gaine, grace, glory, ioy, and fame; Gaine, for all's gain'd in thy all-giving loue; Grace, for Gods loue is mans extreamest grace; Glorie, for thou do'st glorifie thy loue; Ioy, sith they needs must ioy, whom In God are all, sith without him are no loyes. ioies embrace; And fame, for Fame ensues the loue of Grace; All these winne we, if we thy loue doe win: Then should we draw our Soules out of sins Case, And, be'ng well bent, shoote loue-shafts at the Pin Of thy deere loue, which lies thine hart within. Orecome vs (Lord) in kindnesse, let thy grace Ever triumph ore our vngrac'ousnesse: So, weele triumph in that gracious disgrace, Giving all glorie to thy graciousnesse, And, loue, and feare thy dread almightynesse. Let not these Blessings greater make thy Curse Against our inbred base vngratefulnesse: O let not thy grace make vs worse, and worse, But to be gracious let it vs enforce! These super-supererogating Workes Proceeding from thy sup'rinducing loue Might make vs (though farre worse then Iewes or Turkes) Math. 11. 22. To entertaine them as thou do'st approue, And giue thy loue no cause ours to reprooue. Since borne I was, I saw but sinne abound, And thy grace ore abounding, which might moue A senslesse stone to sincke in Teares profound, Flowing from highest loue, in Teares ydrownd. Thou deal'st not thus with the adiacent Lands (Although perhaps they haue provokt thee lesse) Captivitie hath oft bound them in Bands, And the Destroiers Sword hath had egresse Through all the Members of them, more, and lesse, Which did not cut, but eate flesh (greedy sword) Deut. 32. 42. Nor shed, but was made drunke with blouds excesse But to out land, alone, thou do'st afford Peace, Plentie, Freedome, Health, Wealth, and thy Word. Yet from him sitting on the kingly Throne Vnto the Slaue that at the Hand-mill grindes, Others, by civill Sword haue beene orethrone, And Masacres of Bodies, and of Mindes, Haue beene performed in all hellish kindes: Vpon their Walles were Woes and Wellawaies Breath'd out with grones, like hollow-voiced windes; Their streetes, with shrikes through soddaine stabs dismaies, By Nights did eccho, and did ring by Daies, While stormes of rage did bloudy billowes raise. The venerable Lore that Time and Arte Ramus.Exchequer'd had, in one Head (rarely wrought) Was let-out by a Dagger, or a Dart, As good for nothing, but to bring to nought: Uertue was held a Rebell, and still sought But to be slaine, and so, by Death, embrac'd: Uice was secur'd by that which Uice had wrought By Uertues helpe, by Uice now quite defac'd, So all, but Vice, then dide, 'or were disgrac'd. And heerewith keene-cheek'd Famine made away Paris, Rochel.Through their best Citties bowels, so to bring Their Bellies and their Backes to kisse, and plaie, So to beguile the smart of famishing, Which in the hollowes of the Hart did sting: Dogs, Cats, Mice, Rats, stale Carion, and Horse-dung (Wherewith perchance they humane-flesh did minge) These did they eate, they were so hunger-stunge, Nay, dide for want of these, through famine longe. Thinke what it is to Sowe, and not to Reape, Or what to haue, what others haue in hold That haue no hold; yet all away doth sweepe And so by spoile of all, liue vncontrold: What tis to haue a Wife, yet haue thy wife To haue no powre to doe, as thy wife should, But, to avoide the Ravishers rude knife, Cannot avoide the losse of more then life. O could a Man behold, at one aspect, The many Hels attending Civill-warre, He would suppose (no doubt) by the effect, Hell had broke loose, and tane Earth prisoner, And vsd it worser then worst Hell by farre: For, if the God of Heav'n a Realme would damme Aboue the Earth, he neede but let it iarre Within it selfe; and then, no Hellish flame Can so torment with anguish, as the same. Diffring in nothing but in Time, and Place Saue that the Sunnes light makes the griefe the more; For it giues light to see the hidious case Of all, when all are almost drown'd in Gore, That, like a Deluge, oreflowes Sea, and Shore; VVhich, if it might be felt, and not be seene, Sense would suppose the same to be lesse sore; For Sight (the Senses Soveraigne) would weene That, that is still vnfelt, that is vnseene. And but that Woes are priviledg'd from iest, I well might say (and yet but iest in sho) That this damnation Divels more detest Then the perdition in the Hell belo; For there their vtmost miseries they kno: And well they wot, if they (as these) should iarre, Their kingdome (like these) should to ruine goe: So they, much more then Hell, feare civill-warre, Because a kingdome it doth more then marre. The Night that Nature hath ordain'd for rest Then yeelds no rest, yet endlesse rest it giues; No rest it yeelds, but kils both Man, and Beast, Yet rest it giues, by reaving of their liues; So, kniues bereaue their rest, that rest by kniues! They disease thereby killing, and ease them being killed. Men go to bed (as to their graue) with breath, Where Death, vnwares, of breath th? oft depriues; So, while they sleepe in life, they sleepe in death, True Image of the life in Hell beneath. For if in that Hell be degrees of Woes, As Truth it selfe affirmes (with voice divine) Then may these seeme to be the worst of those That lowest Hell doth in it selfe confine; For, weeping and Teeth-gnashing, that Hels Signe Is seene each where, where civill Swords doe rage, VVhich do the best-backt states in sunder chine, And with Hell-like confusion doe engage The brightest Empires to darke Vassallage. As when the might'st Baiazeth is come Into the clawes of some rude Tamburlaine, Hee's vsd more basely then the basest Groome, Till he be forc'd to beate out his owne Braine Against the cage of his hard Harts disdaine: So, when the civill Swords vncivilliz'd In mightist Empires, there it runnes amaine Through all, till all be with Contempt surpriz'd, Or, all doe end, ere so will be dispisde. 2 Kin. 11. 1, 2, 3 2.

So wee alone (orewhelm'd in Earthlie Blisse) Still diue in Pleasures Streames to finde new Ioies, Not knowing once what Sword, or Famine is, Nor the least thing that Nature ought annoyes, 2.

VVhat are we (Lord) or what our Fathers house, That it by thee such vvelfare still enioies, As it doth seeme thy vvhole care's cast on vs, And to vs only wert most gracious! VVhat endlesse Peales of Praise are due to thee From those to whom (as to vnworthy vs) Thou leavest not an headlesse Anarchee, As to the Caniballs prodigious, A Government more then most monsterous! Gen. 10. 6. 8. 10 Isai. 66. 19.Nor as to the Tartarian Herdes of Cham, Nor Swarmes of Tubal-gog (most ravenous) But with thy powre divine, them vp didst dam Farre off from Albion in the Land of Ham! Our present happinesse shall more appeere (And long may it bee present and to come) Compared with the state wherein we were At our grand Ancestors first calling home To civill life (that long did rudely rome) Their common-weale (if so it may bee call'd) VVas (like to Romes when Sylla rag'd in Rome) VVith Rage, and Wronge, and lawlesse might enthrall'd, And by each savage Furie ever galld. The greate devour'd the meane, the meane the lesse; VVho could gripe hardest held all as he would; VVho crost his will, the law did then transgresse, For which he dide, or dying liue he should; So strongest Theeues themselues did Princes hold: All was worse then it seem'd, yet seem'd all woe, For twas a Nation (which this Land did hold). That liv'd by one anothers overthro, Yet, for they liu'd togither, seem'd not so. I could, although my Muse were neere so dull, Be endlesse in this infinite discourse: But now, Decorum hy the eare doth pull My forward Muse, and staies her in her course, Lest that a Booke her Preface wax perforce: It is ynough my Booke doth ore abound VVith tedious lines, if not with lines farre worse. Yet in well-borne Prolixitie is found That which abortiue Breefenesse cannot bound. And for a tast (God graunt it may prooue tastie) Of what the Muse can doe now thou art come, That which ensues (though shee were over-hastie) Is her first speach since Musing made her dombe: This Brat, conceaved in her barraine Wombe, Was made to moue by the all-movers aide, And if both moue thee to like all, or some, I shall account my Muse the blessedst Maide That everfor an Husband so long staide. Yet shee that next to God and thee hath right My service to command, commandeth me To be hir Mouth (to vtter what shee might) vnto hir great'st Protector, next to thee, Ere that my short wing'd Muse doo further flee: My deerest Country VVales commandeth this, That in the depth of all humilitee I let hir Prince to know how ill shee is, For want of him, hir Loue, hir Life, hir blisse. VVhat shall I say (deere Liege) I'm at a stand That haue so much (with little skill) to say; Heau'n, Earth, Men, Beasts, Fish, Fowle, yea, Sea and Land Exults with vs, insults on those that may And will not; curst be those I (cursing) pray: To curse Gods foes, and youres, is but to blesse Those that be his, and yours, and both obay; David did so, and Davies doth no lesse, Amen saie all, that loue true blessednesse. John Davies. CAMBRIA To the high and mighty, Henry by the grace of God Prince of Wales. Great Grandame Wales, from whom those Ancestors Descended, from whom I, (poore I) descend, I owe so much to my Progenitors, And to thee, for them, that vntill mine end Thy name, and fame, Ile honor, and defend: Sith Ioy doth passage to thy speech deny (For that thy Prince thine honor doth commend) Lest that thy silence might be tane awrie, Mine Artlesse Pen shall thy Tongues want supply. Did Curtius more for Rome, then I for thee, That willingly (to saue thee from annoy Of dire dislike, for ingratuitee, Do take vpon me to expresse thy ioy, And so my Muse in boundlesse Seas destroie? Yet, lo, deere Grandame, how my ne active Loue, My little All doth (more then all) imploy For thee, that thou by me thy Prince maist moue To loue thee for the ioy he makes thee proue. O then most gracious Sonne vnto that Sire, VVhose grace doth glorifie both Sire, &amp; Sonne; Of thy great grace I (prostrate) thee desire To cast thine Eye on mine intention, Rather, then on my Muses action. The Burden's waighty which shee vndergoes, And shee is VVeake, and Dull in motion; Then let thy lively Soule hir Soule inclose, And giue hir youth and Spright, that aged groes. As when a yongling lieth by the syde Of some old Sire, his age doth vertue draw From his deere youth, that makes Age longer bide: So mine invention old, cold, rude, and raw, (Not able to disgest ought in hir maw) May by the quicke hereditary heate Of thy yong Muse (that yeiest thoughts can thaw) In VVales, my Countries name, performe this feate, And welcome thee to thy long empty Seate. But ô! I feele, but with the thought of thee, My frozen thoughts to melt, as with a Sunne, Whose comfort Brutes Remayne doth long to see: And through my Nerues I feele the warme bloud runne Fr? hart, to braines, to heat invention. Mount Muse vpon the winges of high desire; Runn Numbers, now my swiftest thoughts outr?ne, That prostrate on my face (while you aspire) I may salute thie Prince (VVales) and his Sire. VVelcome ten-thouzand times ye sacred Paire, Great Atlas, and Alcides of this Land, Vpon whose shoulders (safe from all impaire) The Commonwealth thereof doth fixed stand, VVhich dext'rously your Vertue doth c?mand. Deere Prince, the weale of Wales, the Brittains blisse, By me (thine owne) VVales lets thee vnderstand, That shee desires thy princely feete to kisse, And praies, as for her Heau'n on Earth, for this. Then come sweete Prince, thy Principalitie Doth long to beare thee on her blisful Brest: There shalt thou see the Hart of Loyalty (Loue-sicke) for want of thee in great vnrest; Then come (Deere sweete) and to thine owne giue rest. For, as an hungrie Stomacke bites the more The neerer meate is to the same addrest: So is thy Peoples longing made more sore To hold thee now they haue thee, then before. There shalt thou finde Brutes venerable Stocke To loue thee, as the Creame of their best bloud; For, all about thee wil they thronging flocke To tender thee their Eies, to doe thee good, Such is the nature of their loving moode. As when a Father, fallen in decay, Doth see his Sonne, that giues him Cloth and foode, Crown'd as a King, Ioy makes his hart her Pray; So will they ioy to see their Ioy to sway. From Owen Thewdor, who from Camber came, (From Camber Sonne of Brute who came fr? Troy) Art thou descended; and thy Bellsires name VVas Thewdor: let vs (Brittaines) then enioy Our owne in thee, in thee, our onely Ioy. VVe haue bin long afflicted, and opprest By those that sought our whole Race to destroy; Then sith we are in thee so highly blest, Lett's haue our owne, thy selfe, to giue vs rest. O come, and comfort vs, our Ioy, our Peace, Let vs haue thee, then haue we all, in thee, All that, that tends to Peace and ioyes increase; And in thy presence we shall blessed be; For thou art blest, then in thee, blest are wee; Sith blest thou art with all that Heau'n doth cast Vpon the Heau'n of Earthes felicitee: Our bloud in thee craues part of it, at last, In recompence of all our sorrowes past. VVhat shall oppunge this, our bloud doth c?vince; Nature hath made thee ours, and we are thine; VVe are thy people, and thou art our Prince; Betwixt vs Loue will haue nor Thyne, nor Myne, But the VVord Oures she doth to vs Assigne: Our Land, our Prince, our People, and our Lawes, Our State, our Common-weale, our Hand, Seale, Signe, All ours, &amp; nought but ours, (deere Prince) because Both Prince and People clos'd are in this clause. Then come All ours, blesse all ours with our Eies Plac'd in the Head, begotten by our Head; VVhich was begotten by our bloud likewise: Come, rule thou vs in that Heads place, &amp; steede, Till thou that Head, in his place, shalt succeede. Here shalt thou see, cas'd in poore Coætes of freeze, Rich Spirits of Troians, which on glory feede, VVho, for they are, and rightly came of these, Each with the nature of the Stocke agrees. Our greatest braverie lies all within (Where greatest Harts do loue the same to haue) VVe say, to braue an abiect sprite, is sinne; But, to be braue in Sp'rite is passing braue: VVe scorne a double-gilt base-mettled Slaue, For we are harted-vvhole, true Iovialists, Making our glorie goe beyond our Graue, So to dissolue Oblivions foggy mists, And blind the Eies of squint-Ei'd Satyrists. For, be it that we know no Complement, Other then such as our deere Ancients knew, That's plaine, and simple, like our harts intent; Yet, if we pleasd, we could be fash'ond new; Lou'd we not more our Fathers to ensue: We want nor wit, nor sp'rit, nor wealth (perchance) Swift-flying Fash'on swiftlie to pursue, In guize, in gate, and courtly dalliance, At Tilt, each way, with Loue, or Marfes lance. VVitnesse our Owen Thewdor, who could giue True demonstration how to court a Queene: Who from the seede of Ioue did grace receiue To beare him selfe in her Eie best-beseene, And made her thoughts a demy-God him weene: He so could draw the motion of her eie By motions seemely, which, in him were seene, That he alone best pleas'd her fantazie, As beeing full of best-grac'd Maiestie. Now, from the Court, descend we to the Campe: And from those elder times, to these of ours: There finde we (no lesse currant for the stampe) Sir. Roger Williams. Williams (worlds wonder for his natiue powers) Out-daring Death in many sanguine showres: The singing Bullets made his soule reioice, As Musicke that the hearing most alures; And, if the Canons bas'd it with their voice, He seem'd as ravisht with an Heav'nly noise. And when the Fo mens Muskets spight did spitt Then would he spitt, in sport, at them the while: The Blowes his courage gaue, were plac'd by witt, For VVitt and Courage dwelt still in his Stile; VVhile Cowardize, and Folly made them vile VVhose glory lay all in their Ladies Lappe, And when he came to Court, at them would smile Yea, smoothlie iest at their soft silken Happe, Yet could, like Mars, take there somtimes a Napp. Runne over all the Stories Tymes affoord, Or prie vpon them with the sharpest sight, VVe shall not finde one did more with his Sword Then this braue Brittaine, and true Troian-Knight, VVho putt Achilles in his Tent to flight P. Parme. By such an over-dareing Enterprize, As all that that heare it, not beleeue it might, But that these Tymes haue seene it with their Eies, And that the fame thereof to Heaven flies. Quite through &amp; through Deaths grizely Iawes hee ran, And made a way through Horrors vgli'st Hell, Yea, danted Death, more like some God, then Man, Vntill the Prince, and Death he did compell To flie for life, which his sword sought to quell: O Skinck how blessed wert thou in his loue That drue thee on, through Death to Glories well, From whence the life of Fame doth flowing move To all, that for her sake such Dangers prove! Should I recount the pettie Miracles By him performed, in his martiall course, My words would scarse be held for Oracles: Suffizeth me, the VVorld (that knew his force) VVell knew his Hart was VVitt, and Ualours Source, And they that most envie our Brittish fame Must needs thus much of him confesse (perforce) That whatsoever from this Brittaine came VVas VVitt, and Spright, or savor'd of the same: But, should I instance in particuler, What Truth doth warrant for the Brittaines glory; I could (perhaps) runne vp their Race, as farre As Ioue, and finde them famoused in story: But, for in me it may be thought vaineglorie, Sith being one, my selfe I seeme to praise, I will desist, although my soule be sory I should desist from that which many waies, Might Camber crowne with everlasting Baies. Th? come, sweet Prince, take thou vs to thy charge, And we, the while will take the charge of thee: Thou shalt thine office easily discharge, For we will more then most obedient bee, Which, to his comfort, thy dread Sire shall see: For, when obedience flowes from ardent loue, It is perform'd with all alacritee; Which thou in vs (we hope) shalt shortly proue, For with thy becke thou shalt vs stay, or moue. If thou wilt come to vs, thou well shalt see Weele spare no paine, that may effect thy pleasure; For each one will be busie, as a Bee, To yeeld thee honied ioie, by waight and measure, And shunne (as Hell) the cause of thy displeasure. Weele plant our Mountaines with the rarest Trees, That may be culled from Pomonas Treasure, And all our hedge-roes shall be ranckt with these, To please thine eie with what with taste agrees. Weele root vp all our roughes, our heath's, our furs, And, in their place, make grasse, &amp; cowslips gro: VVe will remoue what thy dislike incurs, And with the Mountaines fill the Vales below, If by Mans powre, and paine they may be so: Nought shall offend thee, be it what it will, (Be it but mortall) if we it may know; For, vveele bring downe the prowdest He, or Hill, That thou shalt doome to be scarce good, or ill. Then liue with vs (decre Prince) and we vvill make Our wildest Wasts Iett-coulored Garden-Plots; So, Flora will her flowred Meades forsake, To set flowres there, in many curious knots, To please thee and (our other selues) the Scots: VVeele turne our Villages to Citties faire, And share them twixt the Scots, and vs, by lots, VVhereto both one, and other may repaire, To interchange Commodities, or Aire. VVeele cleeue the Mountaines Neptune to let in, That Ships may floate, where now our Sheepe do feede: And, whatso-ere industrious hands may win Shall not be lost, that may thy pleasure breede, Or richer make our intermixed Seede: And whereas now two Townes doe scarce appeere Within the largest Prospect; then, with speede, They shall be built, as if one Towne they were, That we may be to each as neere, as deere. Those pleasant Plots where erst the Romaines built Faire Citties for their Legions to liue in, VVhose gorgeous Architecture was oreguilt, That by the civill Sword haue ruin'd bin, (“Which Ruines are the Monuments of sinne) These will we now repaire, faire as before, That Scots, and Brittaines may mixt liue therein: Caerleon, where king Arthure liu'd of yore, Shall be rebuilt, and double gilt once more. And all along her gaudy gallant Streetes VVeele go in Triumph, singing once a day God, and our Princes praises (sweete of sweetes) Vpon our Harpes, like Angels, all the way, For that our Prince is pleasd with vs to stay: VVhat ist that loiall thankefull Harts can doe, But we will doe, nay, do much more then thay? Thus doe we Brittaines our Prince kindly woo To rule vs, ere misrule doth vs vndoo. If prowde we be (as Pride perhaps vvill say) How can wee choose, now we haue such a Prince? Yet shall we prowder be him to obey, Then prowde of our dominion, long since, VVhen with our Swordes we did the Land convince. Wee were a People free, and freely fought For glorie, freedome, and preheminence, But now our totall glory shall be sought In this, that we will serue thee as we ought. Beleeue not Envy (Prince) that vs pursues (Because shee knowes our Race is halfe divine) That will (perhaps) say we our selues misuse, And to contention over-much incline; This may be put on any mortall line By Envies malice; but thou shalt perceaue Our vice is Wit, and Courage-masculine, With constant kindnesse mixt; which Brute did leaue To Camber, from whom, we did it receiue. Nor may it be harmonious to thine Eares To heare our stocke deprau'd by Iniurie; For, thy deer'st bloud (as to the World appeares) Is soild thereby with odious obloquie; Then stop their mouthes that breath such blasphemie: Let not our plainenesse be their common-place To make them sport, in bitter foolery; For we hold plainenesse to be no disgrace, How ere, false-harted Fiends may deeme it base. I doe confesse vvee open-harted are, Scorning Italian-hollow-bartednesse: Where we dislike, there shew the same we dare, And where we loue, we loue for nothing lesse Then that which tasts of base vnworthinesse.

For our VVill's Baiard blind, yet bold, and free, And, had she way made in hir maine Carreere, sh'would runne into that Light that none can see Saue light of Lights, to feele the secrets there, Which Angells wonder at, yet not come neere: But Reas'ns conduct is nothing safe The secrets of the highest Heaven are farre aboue the reach of humane Reason: herein, Therefore the VVill hath too iust cause of feare Lest shee should runne into presumptuous sinne, For which divinest Angells damn'd haue bin. For since our Proto-parents lowest fall, Our wisdoms highest pitch (God wot) is low: But had they stood Hee had infus'd in all His VVord, (selfe-VVisdome) which alone to know Is to know all that VVisdomes selfe can showe: But since, the state of things is so vnstay'd That humane vvisedome stands it wotts not howe; Vnsure in all; for Iudgment's oft betrai'd In that which proofe before had well Every knowledge hath its beginning of the senses, which are often deceiu'd. Therefore all sci?ces which are deriu'd &amp; fast rooted in the senses are vncertaine, &amp; deceiptfull. assai'd. But having toucht the Braine, the Soule, the VVill, (All which (saue of the soule) can brooke no touch) It rests that Reasons heasts wee doe fulfil, To prosecute much more, or more then much, That VVitt for VVill wil willingly avouch: Th'al-giving Giver giveth al that liue (His Creatures) such desires, and Natures such; As for their good with good wil stil should striue, And shun what ere should them of it depriue. Beasts more th? Men (the more Beasts m? the while) Pursue that good that doth their natures fitt. To them for that (though they be nere so vile) Is highest knowledge giv'n, and they vse it, Thereby condemning both mans VVill, and VVitt: And yet hath Man a (synn-peruerted) will To seeke that good he knowes most 'requizit, Who knowes &amp; loues the good, yet takes the ill Oft for the good, but for the evill stil. Yet as he was ordain'd to greater good, So greater knowledge was in him infus'd; With no lesse will, (were it not sinn withstood) To seeke that Good; yet the will witt-abus'd When it hath found it, is oft witt The vnderstanding abused by the misreport of the inferior senses diverts the will from embracing good obiected to hir. refus'd: Vnhallowed sense, drown'd in that damned iuyce, (Synnes Syder) from Eaues fatall: Apple bruiz'd, (Be'ing deadly drunck) makes stil the worser choise, Wherein (like Sow in mire) it doth reioyce. Among the hoast of Natures creatures, bee Three kindes of Appetites, (there ay consorts) 3. Kinds of Appetites in all creatures. Naturall, sensitive, and Voluntarie. The first divided is into two sortes; One found in all that to the VVorld resortes: That's inclination voide of Sense or Soule, To doe what the owne nature most importes: The naturall apetite two-folde. As light things mount, and heavy downwards roule, Which nature, Natures selfe cannot controule. The other with this vertue action haue, Which nerthelesse proceedeth not from sense; To Vegetatiue Soules this, Nature gaue, Soules Vegetatiue. Which in Trees, Plants, and Grasse hath residence; Who doe desire to sucke that influence That feedes them, and avoides the contrary; A plant will thirst for moistures confluence; And draw to it all kinde humidity, Retayning that it liues and prospers by. The like in our owne members we obserue, Who wanting nutriment doe sucke the vaines; The vaines doe sucke the bloud themselues to serue; Thus each attracteth foode when neede constraines, And all things living seeke the same with paines: Hence we devide this naturall desire The natural desire how divided. Into two kindes, the one, each plant retaines, The other, things which life doth sense-inspire, As Man, and Beast, and what doth els respire. The Seate of this desire stands on two feete, Which fixt are in two places; That's to say The liver, and the Stomacke; there doe meete The forces of this Appetite to slay With famine, or with foode fraile life to stay: The sensitiue desire is two-fold too, From sense the first, the last comes not that way, The sensitiue apetite two-fold. The first, to ioy and griefe is fixed so, That no force can it from the same vndoe. For in the sinewes (Feelings instruments) This pow'r is plac'd, or in the Synewy skin; And that the Synewes ioyes, or discontents, That wel, or ill, affecteth them within: By heate, or cold, they paine, or pleasure wyn, As they to them are wel, or ill applied. For sense and motion synewes made haue bin That by them paine or pleasure should be tride, And make our Bodies moue on ev'ry side. Nor doe these Appetites wait on the will, Ne from the Phantazie doe they proceede, For wil we, nil we, we shal hunger stil, Wh? food's with-drawn, that should our Bodies feed; And we shal feele what sense affects with speede, How ere the will or Phantazy impung; We may abstaine from nurrishment in deede, But then thereby much more for it we long, And Flesh wil pine with paine, if hunger-stung. But th'other Appetites bredd without touch, Are forged by the thoughts or Phantazie; These, discreete Nature in the hart doth couch, Which be Affectes that lurke in secresie, Be'ng motions of the hartes Hart properlie: These wait on witt, and choose or else reiect What it holds deerest, or doth most defie; So VVitt's the cause, and they are the effect, That loue, or loath, as witt doth them direct. This vvitt, and vvill, the Beasts doe not possesse, For their most knowledge is most sensuall; Guided by Nature in their Brutishnesse, Onely by inclination naturall, Which moues their sense vn-intellectual, Or this, or that way, without Reasons Though Beasts haue much more perfect outward senses then Men, yet can they not imploy them reasonably as Men doo. sway; The vvitt and vvill their sense wee cannot cal, Though sensuall will and witt we cal it may: For man alone hath both to guide his way. The Voluntary Appetite we finde Is gott by Reason, and produc'd by vvill, By it we are to good or ill inclin'd, As Reason doomes of them by Iudgments skill: Two actions hath the vvill in reason still, By which we good embrace, and ill refuse, Reason revealing what is good or ill, Who rules hir not as though will could not choose, But as one teaching Hir hir pow'r to vse. As in the Vnderstanding and the Minde Of Men, and Angells, God hath fixt his forme, So to Mannes will Free-will is not avoided by grace but established: because grace healeth the Wall that is, giveth vs a will to righteousnes.

Then Iustice would that God mans will should doe When Man doth Gods vvill, Godlinesse hath the promises of this life and that to come. When Man pleaseth God God wil please Man. All is to be given to God who prepareth the good-will of Man to bee holpen, and helpeth i being prepared. Aug Enchir. ad Laurent. Cap. 22. this exchang is iust; And Gods free-wil must needes subscribe thereto, Sith it is free to doe that needes it must, VVhich cannot doe the thing that is vniust; For that were bondage free, or freedome bound; Sith ro doe evill but to haue a lust VVere Vassallage to Sathan that Hel-hound, VVhich fredome to doe good would quite confound. But yet the vvill hath many motions else, Diverse degrees therein doe plaine appeare; Some haue such open harts and wilful vvills As that they loue and hate through passion meere: So, Reason their Mindes Sterne in vaine doth steere, For sense they serve, and have no patience The seemeing neerest pleasure to These are Beasts in humane shape, whereof the World's too full. forbeare For further good; but forth-with please their sense, As sensuall appetite doth them incense. But vvill in others, so hir selfe commaunds, And those Pow'rs to her pow'r subordinate, That (being free) shee bindeth both in bands And vnto Reason all doth captivate: As, many Dropsy-drie forbeare to drincke, Because they know their ill t'would aggravate; So, vvill herein from her owne selfe doth shrinke, And cleaves to that, that Reason best doth thinke. The Heau'ns, and Earth, and all the Elements, (And what besides Man, is of them compos'd) Doo GOD obay in his commaundements, For, as Hee wils, so are they al dispos'd; Yet never he himselfe to them disclos'd: Then not from knowledge their obedience springes, But from the nature in their kinds inclos'd; Yet Men he made to know and doe the things That be of him, which grace and Knowledge bringes. And that he should with more heede doe the same, A VVill he giues him ioyn'd with griefe and Griefe &amp; Ioy are alwaies Consociates of our will. Ioy; Which vvill might ioy when she doth passion tame, And in the contrary might feele annoy, All as shee doth her natiue powres imploy. Here hence we know the odds twixt Ioy and Griefe, For in extreames they comfort or destroy Such as leade here a good, or evil life, Both flowing from the vvill, their fountaine chiefe. This pow'r hath highest vertue of Desire, And Cæsarizeth ore each Appetite; Shee rules (being taught) with libertie intire, VVhose actions are to vvill and nill aright; VVhose Obiect's real good or so in sight: In nature shee hates ill in deede, or show, And in the true, or false good, doth delight; If ill for good shee choose, hence it doth gro Because ill seeming good, shee takes it so. Shee nought can loue but hath some show of good; Nor ought can The will naturally cannot desite that which in nature is evill. loath but hath like show of ill; Desire of good by her may be with-stoode, But it shee cannot loath, or leave it still: So may shee choose to execute her will, VVhen ill is tendred her indeede, or sho, But cannot loaue it, or her wil fulfill, Because to ill shee is a mortall foe, And lothes it as sole worker of her woe. Then must shee needs be ever vnconstrain'd, Sith her Creators Wil would haue it so; Shee could not be her selfe, were shee restrain'd, And though shee waites on Reason to, and fro, Will makes Reason to attend her.Yet shee makes Reason waite her will to kno: For, touching her, her Lord confines his powre, Which cannot take that he did once besto, Namely, arbiterment, (her richest dowre) Except Not-beeing, should her quite devoure. The Wil may obiect, or not obiect what shee will to the Minde.For shee hath powre, to obiect to the Minde What pleaseth her, or not the same obiect; And while the Thoughts the same do turne &amp; winde, Shee may oreturne those Thoughts or them neglect, And turne the Minde to what shee shal direct: Yea when as Iudgments final doome is giv'n, Shee may, or may refuse the same t'effect; For Men are not as Beasts by Nature driv'n, Vnlesse of Reason they are quite bereav'n. The vnderst?ding straineth out of the secret &amp; hid causes of thinges that which to wisd?e is incident. Wil exacting the s?e.About shee goes when Iudgements doome is past, And re-examines what it hath decreed; Which done, perhaps the same shee will distast, (Although the sentence be direct indeede) And runnes another course, lesse right, with speed: Which second The Wil refuseth Good being found, not for being good; but not being so good as it willingly would haue. I'l spirits may provoke our f?tasies &amp; wil. search yet aimes at greater right, Though shee mistakes the same for want of heede, Which want proceeds fr? Sins extreame dispight, That blindes our Mindes eies in extreamest light. Wherefore it vs behoues Grace to invoke, Whereby wit vprightly may weld the will; For as ill Sprites our fantazies provoke, So on our wils they may the like fulfill, And make her scorne to rule by Reasons skill: For, shee's ambitious and delights to raigne Without controle, how euer well, or ill; And beeing free shee runneth on amaine, To ioy if wel, if otherwise, to paine. This liberty of Monarchizing thus Shee deemeth good, what ill so ere ensues; It is a kind of bondage to haue powre, wil, and liberty to doe ill. Which libertie, is bondage base to vs, And free we were, if our will could not chuse But vse His will, that gaue vs wils to vse: Whose only service, only freedome is, And only they are Slaues that it refuse; Sith they are Sathans servants (if not his) Which please him most, when they do most amisse. For in this great commerce of terrene things, The bad where of exceeding so the good, And that so fast the one to other clings That twixt them both there is great likelyhood, Hardly by will can they be vnderstood: And sith Men Bodies haue aswel as Soules, Things bodily best like the bodies moode, Which often so the Minde and VVill controules, That as it lusts it rules and over-rules. Herehence it is, some mortall life doe prize Whosoever seekes felicity where it is not shall finde infelicity where it is. Aboue eternal, and their guts aboue The highest God, that doth their guts suffize; And though the will herein may rigor proue; Yea, may be forc'd to leaue what it doth loue, Yet nought can her resistlesse powre constraine, For nothing can desire from her remoue, Although shee cannot doe what she would faine: So maugre force, shee freedome doth retaine. Reason and mans desires shoulde be in continuall league.Sith Reason then the VVils desires should sway, And bring th' Affections to obedience, Its requisite they should accorde alway To mainetaine warres against rebelling Sense; Which is the rule of Reasons consequence: Wherefore we may wel iudge of Reasons rule, By the Affections and VVils continence; As a good Prince or Master of a Schoole, Make them they governe, hate, and shun misrule. The Hart and Minde beeing at Vnity procure the tranquility of the Affections.And, for th' Affections from the hart proceede (Which is the Seate of loue to God and Men) If then the hart and Minde be wel agreed, The hart with flames of lasting loue will bren, And fire out froward Passions from their den: Then wil the Tongue from harts aboundance speake Gods highest laudes till they report agen; Then loue twixt Tongue &amp; Hart shal marriage make, To bring forth naked Truth, which loue doth seeke. Wherefore the Providence divine did place The lunges (the voices Organs) next the Hart; (As the Mindes instruments the Braines embrace) That they may neere at hand, soone vse their Art; As Orators of Princes play their part Neere to their Sov'raignes; And wert not for sinne, The Braines and Hart are the Seates of Reason and the Affecti?s. Sin is nothing because it was made without him, without wh? nothing was made that was made.The VVill, from Reasons rule should never start, And twixt the Hart, &amp; Braine there should haue bin A lasting league, as beeing neere of kin. Sin, noughty Nothing that mak'st all things nought, (Except the Thing of Things that made th? good) Thou wast vnmade thy selfe, yet ill haste wrought; Whereby thou haste so perverst Flesh, and Bloud, That now by it all goodnesse is with-stood: Damn'd Nothing that hast such a some-thing stride, How wast begot? by whom? and in what moode? Through lust; By Eaue and Adam; In their pride: Now Sinne. Error speakes what The scriptur Truth hath iustifide. For wit, will, Anger, and Concupiscence, Are fowre powres of the soule, wherein should lie Fowre vertues, taking thus their residence: VVisedome in wit, in will Integritie: Valor in Ire, and in lust, Temprancie: But wit with ignorance, and will, with wronge, Anger with Feare, and lust, with libertie Are so pervers'd, that they themselues impunge, Except preventing grace be mixt amonge. The totall frame of mans divinest part, By light divine we see is out of frame; Th'antipathie betwixt the That is, betweene Reason and the Affections. Minde and Hart, Giues but too good assurance of the same: And though the minde in all her limbes be lame, Yet in our little world shee raignes as Queene, And seekes wilde passions of the Hart to tame, That in her selfe there might bee ever seene, Soule-pleasing ioy and peace to flourish greene. For shee's the mancion of Felicitie, Contrived so, that there its safe confin'd; To which there is no way nor entery, But through th' Affections, servants of the Minde: Yet they too oft disloial prooue by kinde, Who liers, and sinne-soothing claw-backes are, Whereby our iudgments eies they (Traitors) blinde, That it erres mortallie ere it beware, If reason of their treason haue not care. Reason, Concupiscence, &amp; Ire, 3. speciall powres of the Soule.For three Powres speciall in the Soule reside, Reason, Concupiscence, and ardent Ire, The first, to Truthes obscure abiding guides; The second, good-things gladly doth desire; The third, doth from the contrarie retire: In bowels of the first the VVits are bred; Th' Affectes are forg'd in both the others fire; In nomber fowre, Ioy, Hope, Sorow, and Dread, Which from the last powres spring, as fr? their head. First, from the first Powre, Ioy and Hope proceedes, (For what we covet, wee ioy in with hope) And Ire, the last powre, Dread and sorow breedes; For, hate to dreade and sorow lies wide ope; Griefe in hates hell the way to dreade doth grope. From these Affects (as from their fountaine) floes All vice and vertue which in Man doth cope, For vice and vertue ay are mortall foes, And as Reas'n rules, so either overthroes. Anima.The soul's call'd Anima our flesh containes, While shee the same with vitall fire filleth; Mens. Mens, while shee mindeth, or shee Minde retaines, Animus.And Animus, while shee hath VVill or willeth; Ratio.Shees Ratio, whilst shee iudgement iust fulfilleth: Spiritus.Then, spiritus shee hight, when shee respires. From all which, science to the soule distilleth, Scientia.So, call'd scientia; thus her names doe change, As shee her qualities doth interchange. The outward senses outward parts possesse, As th'inward to the soule are knit by kinde: And, for the soule her powre doth most expresse In that whereto her soule is most inclinde, Here-hence it is, men mortified in minde The soule vseth not the ministry of the outward senses when shee is swallowed vp with divine meditations. Whose spirits powres on things divine are bent Fare, as they were sometimes, deafe, dombe, &amp; blind, Their contemplations are so violent: But, Vulgars outwarde sense is excellent. But while the soule can take a strict survay Of all the instruments which shee doth vse, So long the owner of that soule may say He hath a iudgement sound, and perfect Muse: But if those instruments that Man misvse, Or ruine them, the soule straight seeing it, Her ruin'd Iaile shee striues then to refuse: Which strife the senses frame doth so vnknit That it confounds it, or distracts the VVit. And in this moode (though we esteeme it madd) Men prophesie, and truely things foretell, The soule being divine works divinely, if shee bee not hindred by, her Clog, the body. Speake diuerse Tongues, which erst they never had, And in Artes which they knew not, they excell. Thus whilst the soule doth hold her house an Hell, Striving to be enlarg'd, becomes more free, Then workes shee like her selfe (exceeding well) That wonder tis, the same to heare and see: O sacred soule (but God) who's like to thee! Now, for the Hart fraile life first intertaines, And is the last part that from it departes, (Without which, dull were reason, dead the braines) It's taken for the part which powre impartes To VVit and VVill, whereby they play their partes; So as it's held the Mirrour of the minde: The Hart the Mirror of the Minde. For, when the Minde vnto herselfe converts, The Hart is interposd, where shee doth finde Her feature fowle, or faire, cleere-eied, or blinde. Then, for the Hart is such a powreful thing, My hart desires to touch it feelingly: A cleane Hart and a cleane soule are convertible.And, for the Hart doth paine or pleasure, bring, The paine is pleasure, when Head properlie Makes hand discribe the Hartes hart handsomly. Earst Mans internal partes we did devide Into three VVombes, the Braines, the Brest, &amp; Belly: About the Braines (before) our skill we tride, And now by it, the Brest must be discride. Which is the Shoppe of al the Instruments Wherewith the vitall Vertue operates; The Hart, the Lunges, with al Lifes incidents In region of the Brest, doe hold their States, Whose Bulke them Bulwarkes fr? what ruynates: The Midriff parteth them from partes that feede (Which the third VVombe, (the Belly) circulates) It being a Muscle made for Natures neede, Assisting in the Breathing Acte and Deede. And next, there is a Tunicle, or Skin, That over-spreads the Concaue of the Brest, Much like a Spiders webbe, subtile, and thin; Wherout two others grow to part the rest, Because two places should be breath-possest: So that, if one (being hurt) could not respire The other might one halfe retaine (at least) To keepe Natures providence for Manns good, should lift vp his minde to the consideration of the loue of a greater Good. Lifes breath (at point to part) intire, And blowe the sparkes that kindle vitall fire. These Felmes (like to a Nett with fruite repleat) Together hold what ere the Brest doth bound, They line the Ribbes, that wh? the Lunges doe beate They might performe their office whole and sound, Without being bone-bruiz'd, which might th? confound. So likewise in a Caule the Hart's inclos'd, Call'd Pericardion, being Ovall round, Or like a Flame for forme, and so dispos'd; To shew that vitall fire is there repos'd. There, in the Hart's the fountaine whence doth flow The Hart is the fountaine of naturall heate. Naturall heate, and by the Artires sends It al abroade to make the Members grow, And keepe them growne, in plight to doe their ends. And though each Instrument of breath attends And serves the Voice, yet were they chiefely made For the Hartes vse, (that Lifes-fire comprehends) That by their service that fire might not vade, VVhich vnkinde coldnesse else might overlade. Wherfore the Lunges (breaths-forge) is preordain'd First to receaue the Aire that cooles the Hart, VVho doe prepare it (being intertain'd) And so prepared, doe the same impart (As Nature wills) to that Life-giving part. The Lunges therfore, are Sp?gy, soft, &amp; light, That Aire might enter, and from th? depart, VVhich guard the Hart (on left side and the right) From bordring Bones, that else annoy it might. VVhich hath a double motion; One, when it It selfe dilates, the other, it restraines. The Hartes motion is double. VVhen it goes out, in goes Aire requisit: And when it shrinketh in, then out it straines All smoky Excrements procuring paines. This motion's kinde, proceeding fr? its kinde (Not as the Muscles moved by the Braines) For which it hath fitt filaments assign'd, VVherby it selfe, it selfe may turne &amp; wynd. This double motion hath two double vses, (A two fold vse whereof we mention'd haue) The next to draw in bloud; and then, by Sluces To send it to the Lunges, for foode they craue At the Harts hands, sith they the Hart doe saue. Thus gratefully they kindnesse interchange, To teach vs how we should our selves A motiue to brotherly loue taken from the disposition of the Members. behaue; For when we disagree, it is as strange As Hart and L?ges should cease to make this ch?ge. Thus, this subordinate Lord of Mannes life (The Hart) resides in his wel-fenced fort; And, though with it al vitall force be rife, And members keepes from being al-amort, Yet should it die, if their helps were cut short. Hence Kings may learne, that though they Monarchize Yet doe they, whom they rule, maintaine their port, Which should induce them, not to tyranize, But, like good Hartes, lifes-pow'r to exercize. The flesh of the Hart is the firmest flesh of any part of the Body.The flesh whereof is firmer, then the flesh Of all the parts the Body hath besides: So, Kinges should be most firme, for, being nesh, Their Subiects might be wo?ded through their sids. Such be the People stil as be their Guides. The Hart with Passion, passion may each part, VVhich Ioy or Sorrowe with the Hart abides: So, Kinges their praise and People may subvert, If Passion over-rule their ruling Art. And in the Bulke it is so situate As that its Base is Center of the Brest; The end whereof (where greatnesse doth abate) Leanes to the left-side more then al the rest; (So Kings, where they fr? Iniustice makes great Kinges lesse, then Fame can take notice of. Right decline, are least.) Yet leanes the Hart so, for two causes great; One, that the Brest-bone should it not infest, The other, that it should the left-side heate, Sith on the right, the Liver doth that feate. And though the Hartes left part more heavy bee, Because its hard and greater then the right, Yet Nature hath so ballanc'd it, that shee Makes it to hange (by admirable sleight) As if the both sides were of equal weight: For in the left part (heaviest) shee putts The vitall Spirit, of its nature light; And in the right part (lightest) loe, shee shutts The waightie Bloud, wherwith that part shee glutts. Lo, thus the Highest holy vpright hand By even counterpoise hath hang'd the Heart In the Brests Center, (like as th'Earth doth stand The Hart is hang'd in the Brest by even counterpoise. In Center of the Heau'ns) by matchlesse Art: Hence we may learne the duty of this part, Which should be vpright in Affects, and vvill, And never from the rules of Vertue start To right hand, or to left, for good or Ill, But come life or come death, be vpright stil: This part likewise hath two Concavities, On left side one, the other on the right: And for this vse, are these capacities; The right receaves the bloud (be'ng boild aright) That from the Liver runnes, to give it might To feede the Lunges, and vitall spirits breede, Bred of pur'st bloud in the left Concaue dight, Like sweate that fr? the right one doth proceede, Which sweate with vitall Spirits it doth feede. That is the furnace, wherein still doth flame The vitall Sp'rit, resplendent, quicke, and cleere, Like the celestiall Nature, for the same Both heate, and life to all the whole doth beare; This Primum mobile that All doth steere: Many good complexions are ill in conditions.These concaues thus are made commodiously; But now (alas) most harts all hollow are, That Bloud and Spirits therein confused lie, So as no Art can one from other spie. In this left concaue where the Hart doth trie His chiefest skill, the vitall sp'rits to make, There is the roote of that great Artery From whom the Artires their beginning take: Which neere the Hart doth so it selfe forsake, That part ascends, and part thereof descends To carrie vitall fire to parts that lacke; These are the pipes whereby the kinde Hart sends His cordiall comfortes to th'extreamest ends. And, for the Veines and Artires neede each other, And that their succors should be neere at hand, They meete, and (for the most part) goe togither, Thereby to vigorize the vitall Band Which the Harts vertue wholy doth command: For, th' Artires being lincked with the Vaines, Lend Aire and Spirit, least their bloud should stand; And fr? the Veines some bloud each artire draines, Which to disperse, the vitall spirit constraines. Mutual loue is to be learned from the mutuall assist?ce of the partes of the body.Betweene the Hart and Lunges the like is seene (As erst was said) to learne vs mutuall loue; For, certaine Pipes doe passe these parts betweene, By which, each others kindnesse they doe proue: The hart from his right side doth bloud remoue Vnto the Lunges by the Arteriall Veine, The Lunges through veyny-artire, aire doth shoue Vnto the hart, it to refresh againe, Whose side sinister doth it entertaine. The hart (besides) hath many members more, Which are distinguisht by Anatomists: The right, and left side hath a little dore, And many a pipe so small therein subsists, That scarce mans eie can see how each exists; Yet all haue vse; for, when the hart doth seeke Such bloud as without which no hart consists, The meanes wherewith it draws it, should not break, But that the strong therein might helpe the weake. And, that the Aire might enter in thereby More mildly, and for Nature, more concinne, Therefore, the hart doth not immediately Draw from the Mouth the aire it draweth in, But through those passages it first doth rin, Lest be'ng too cold t'would coole the hart too much; For all extreames, saue extreame good, are sinne, And Nature Vertue in the Meane doth couch, Vertues Throne is erected iust betweene extreames. Shewing, that our desires should still be such. That God, whose powre no power can resist, Resists all powers that are too violent, And ever doth the moderate assist; From whose hand (only) comes the Thunder-dent, To plague the prowde, and wound th'incontinent: For, should his Creatures powre b'immoderate, Then should not his owne bee so eminent: So, if they it affect, he them doth hate, And with a thundring vengeance ends their date. Thus having sleightly toucht this render part, (Touching his substance, proper place, and frame) It now remaines that we doe proue our Arte Touching another motion of the same, Belonging to our soules affections lame, Lam'd by our Flesh too lustie, yet too fraile, Too lustie in desire of its owne shame, But fraile in that wherein it should prevaile, Yet when its weak'st, the Soule doth most assaile. It not suffiz'd that nere-suffized Loue That al things made, to make Man only Bee, But to Be vvell, as wel some men doe proue, VVho though of Beeing, they desirous be, Yet not being wel, they Murder themselues. end ill, sith they see Their being VVell, and Being disagree: Then The Soule Vegetatiue desires to Be, The Sensitiue to be well, The reasonable to be best, and therfore it never rests till it be ioyned to the best. Being, was not Manns creations end, But to be happy in a high degree: And therfore al men al their forces bend, T'inioy that Good, that Beeing doth c?mend. Which good desire of Good, in Man is knitt To a detesting of the contrary; But, for that sinne hood-wincks Mans Eie of VVitt He gropes for Good, but feeles the Evill cleaves to each worldly Good, as Canker doth to Silver. Evill by: From this desire of Good, th'affections flie; Which with their motion swift draw that desire Heere, there, and where soere they please to hy, In pursute of that Good which they require, To which (though base they bee) they would aspire. Yet they were good, &amp; kindly lov'd their like; But they are ill, and loue Ill seeming good; Yet they by Natures instinct Ill dislike; And yet by nature evil is their moode. Basely obaying the sinne-soiled Blood: At first they were Truthes other selfe, for friends; Yet now by them shee's too too much with stoode, Adhering to her foe, while shee pretends To blesse the Sense, though to accursed endes. The motiues of the Soule these motions are, Whose other names are called the Affects; By foll'wing good, and flying ill, they ARE; Consisting so of these two good Effects; Though Syn their sense with error oft infects: Some vsher Iudgment, some on her attend, The later, take or leaue as shee directs; The Former, naturally cannot offend, For they desire but Nature to defend. As when the Body (Nature to suffize) Desires to eate, or drinke, (as neede requires) Or when good happe or ill doth it surprize, Then Ioy and sorrow (as Plato affirmes) are the Ropes wherewith we are drawne to the embracing or avoiding of euery action. Ioy or sorrow moueth our desire: These stil fore-run our Iudgment, &amp; conspire With Nature, to vsurpe her highest Throne; For nature runneth on, or doth retire, As shee is mov'd by iudgment of her owne, And so doe these that Nature wait vpon. But those Affects that follow Iudgm?ts Traine Wait hard, as long as Hart is wel dispos'd; Then lasts the League betweene the Hart &amp; Braine, For, al their iarres by Reason are compos'd: But when the Hart against the Brain's oppos'd, (Which oft proceeds of too much pampering) Out flie th'Affections that were erst repos'd, And from their neckes the Raines of Reason fling, Impatient of slow Iudgments rarrying. Yet true it is that Hart cannot be mov'd, Ere Iudgment doomes what's good or badd for it; Then Hartes desires by her must be approv'd, Or els the Hart cannot desire a whit: For what Iudgement foregoes the Affections. she holds vnmeet, it thinks vnfitt. But for the motions of the Minde are free, And neede not stay, as it is requisit, So before Iudgment doe they seeme to Bee, Although they follow her as bond and free. But though th'Affections cannot moue at all If Iudgment wing them not and make them flee, Yet sound advice (which heere we Iudgment call) The Affections may work without so?d advisement.May be at rest when they too busy bee, Mov'd by the iudgment of the Fantazee: This Iudgment's blinde, yet is it most mens Guide, And no lesse rash, yet ruleth each degree; This makes th'Affects from Rights straight Pathes to slide, For Fantazy doth fancie waies too wide. This skipp-braine Fancy, moves these easie Movers To loue what ere hath but a glimpse of good; Then straight she makes th? (like vnconstant lovers) To ch?ge their Loues, as she doth change her moode, VVhich swimmeth with the current of the Bloud: For as the body's well or ill compos'd, (VVhich followes oft the nature of its foode) So Fancy and these Fondlings are dispos'd, Though in the Soule, and Minde they be inclos'd. And yet the body's but the Instrument VVheron the The Soule worketh by motion, and the Body by Action. soule doth play what she doth please; But if the stringes thereof doe not concent, The harmony doth but the soule displease; Then tune the body Soule, or playing cease: And when a String is out, straight put it in With Phisickes Phisicke can extenuate the Humors that make the Body vnapt to execute the workes of Vertue. helpe, which Passion may appease, By humbling that which hath too lowd a dyn, And put the Parts on a Soule-pleasing Pyn. These Partes though many, yet of three consist, That's, Humors, Elements, and Qualities; Which three, doc of fow'r partes, a part subsist, For from Earth, VVater, Aire, and Fire doth rise All that the Heav'nly Cope doth circulize: These are the Elements from whom proceede The Humors be the children of the Elements. Humors with their foresaid qualities; For, Bloud, Flegme, Choller, Melancholy breede Hott, Cold, Moist, Dry, a fowr-fold vital Seede. An Element is the most simple part An Element, what. VVhereof a thing is made, and in its wracke Is last resolved; And in Phisicks Art There are but tvvo, which two of those doe lack That al the Elemental bodies make: These two, are tearmed Simples, &amp; C?pounds, 2. Elements in Phisick-Arte. The first, is borne on Speculations back; The last, is bredd by Practize, which c?fo?ds Two or moe Simples in each others bounds. The Elements of Natures famelies Produce the Elementals temprament, VVhich is a mixture of the Qualities Or composition of each Element: (As these doe bend, so are their bodies bent) VVhich we Complexion cal; wherof are two, Complexion what. VVell, and ill tempred; And the Aliment That feeds the Body, herein much can doe, For that can make &amp; marre Complexion too. Wel tempred Complexion, what. VVell-tempred, is an equal counterpoise Of th' Elements fore-mention'd qualities; Whereof ther's but one thing of Natures choise VVherein shee made the mixture thus precise: (As Galens tract of Tempers testifies:) VVhich, of each hand, is the interior skin: And hence we may thus fitly moralize; That Nature to the Hand so good hath bin, That it might temper what the Mouth takes in. Il C?plexion, what. Ill tempred's that where some one Element Hath more dominion then it ought to haue; For they rule ill that haue more regiment Then nature, wisdome, right, or reason gaue: So doth this Element it selfe behaue: Yet each ill temper doth not so exceede, As that it spils what better tempers saue; For some surpasse the temperate in deede, In some small ods, whereof no harmes succeede. The Bodies temper is fiue waies discerned.Fiue waies the Bodies temperature is knowne, By Constitution, Operation, Clime, Coulor, and Age, by these the same is showne, As Dials by an Index shew the time. The Body fat is cold, for fat doth clime By cold degrees; and that, full-flesht is hot, For heate proceedes from bloud, as doth my rime From braines; where no heate were, if bloud were not, And bee'ing too cold they would my sense besot. By Operation too, the temper's found, For when a creature, (Man, Beast, Hearbe, or Plant) Doth that which they by right of kinde are bound, Then no good temprature those bodies want: The Clyme in shewing this is nothing skant; For South-ward, Men are cruell, moody, madd, Hot, blacke, leane, leapers, lustfull, vsd to vant, Yet wise in action, sober, fearefull, sad, If good, most good, if bad exceeding bad. The Northen Nations are more moist, and cold, Lesse wicked and deceiptfull, faithfull, iust, More ample, strong, couragious, martiall, bold, And, for their bloud is colder, lesse they lust: Then cold bloud being thicke, it follow must They are lesse witty, and more barberous; And for they inwardly are more adust, A natural reason for the gurm?dizing, and quassing of the Flemmings. They meate and drinke devoure as ravenous, The panch and pot esteeming precious. Yet are they most laborious, loving Artes; Whose soules are in their fingers (as its sed;) For, all our best hand-workes come from those parts, As from the hotter Climes, workes of the bed: And those that twixt the South, and North are bred (As France and Italy, Spaine, and the like) Of hot and cold, are ev'nly tempered; Therefore they are not made so apt to strike; But warre with VVisdome, rather then the Pike. The coulor likewise shewes the temprament; The Coulor shews the bodies temper. For Sanguin's red: and yellow's Cholericke: The Melancholy is to blacknesse bent: The white or whitish, is the Phlegmaticke: The white, and blacke, are cold and rhewmaticke: The Red, and yellow, hot by course of kinde: To this consents each skilfull Empericke, Who by experience of their practise finde That coulor shewes the temper, notes the minde. The Sanguin's frolicke, free, ingenious, Couragious, kinde, to women over-kinde; True Iovialists, by nature generous; And hot and humid they are by their kinde: The Chollericke is hasty, and inclinde To Envie, pride, and prodigalitie; The reason why men cholericke of c?plexion are soone angry.As Herc'les-hardy, though with anger blinde; And in its temper it is hot and drie, Which is the cause it is so angery. The Phlegmaticke are idle, sleepie, dull, Whose temper's cold and moist, which drownes the wit: The Melancholy's mestiue; and too full Of fearefull thoughts, and cares vnrequisit; Who loue (as loathing men) alone to sit: In temper cold and drie too like the dust, (Dust of the earth, ere God life-breathed it, Where hence we came, and wherevnto we must) Which flies (as fearefull) from a little Gust. These are the humors, whereof Man consists, A humor, what.Which is a substaunce thin, to which our foode The Stomackes heate by nature first disgests, And hath dominion chiefly in our bloode: These like the Elements moue in their moode: For bloud is hot, and humid, like the aire: Flegm's cold, and moist, in VVaters likelyhood: Then Melancholy's like Earth, cold and dry'r: And hot, and drie is Choler, like the Fire. Howe the meates are changed to Humors.And, that the meates to humors should be chang'd They must be thrice concocted thorowly: First, in the Stomacke they are interchang'd And made that Chyle wherein potentially The Humors (Chaos-like) at first doe lie: Next, in the Liver the Masse Sanguiner Of Chyle composed is, successiuely: The third, and last's through al the bodie, where Humors are made, that Meate and Chyle first were. These raigne by turnes, vntill their tearmes be done: Bloud, in the spring, from three till nine each Morne: How the Humors raigne in mans body Choler, from thence, till three in th'after noone In sommer-season: Then Flegme in his turne From thence till nine at night doth rule the sterne In Autumne: then sad Melancholy thence Till three next Morne, when VVinter doth returne: Thus in their turnes they haue preheminence, Till Time turne vs, and them with vs from hence. And as these humors haue their turnes in time, How, &amp; when the Planets rule in mans body. So rule the Planets in like consequence: For, by the Moone is governed our Prime That's hot and moist, but the preheminence The moisture hath; So our Adolescence Is swaid by VVit-infusing Mercury Being hot and moist, yet doth more heate dispense, Which tunes the voices Organes erst too hy, Making them speake with more profundity. Th?, youth (our third age) Loues Queene, Venus swaies Bee'ng hot and dry, but yet more hot, then drie; In this we VVantons play, in Venus plaies And offer Incense to a rowling eie: Bright Sol (the gloriou'st Planet in the sky) Doth rule our Manhoode which is temperate: Hee Author is of race and gravity; Of haplesse life this is the happi'st state, Which they hold long'st that are most moderate. And lastly old age being cold, and dry, By al-wise Iupiter is governed, Author of Councell, Craft, and Policy: VVhich Age againe in two's distinguished, The first yonge old age may be Christened: The last Decrepit is, and so is call'd; Which Saturn rules with Scepter of dul lead: This Age to Life like Death, is stil enthrall'd, Thus in our life the Planetts are enstall'd. Precise dates assigned to severall changes of mans age in his life.And to these Ages, dates precize we giue; As Child-hood from our Birth till thirteene yeares: Adolesc?ce, fr? th?ce to tw?ty fiue: And youth fr? th?ce til fiue, &amp; thirty weares; Fr? wh?ce, til fiftie Mannes-estate apperes: And to the rest old-age we doe assigne; But one his yeares th? other better beares, As time their temprature doth enterteigne, Therfore the temprature should age designe. For al men cold &amp; dry are old, though yonge, Psal. 31. 11.Some yong at sixtie, some at forty old; In growing old the youthful Sanguin's l?ge, For it doth store of heate, and moisture hold: The Melancholy, being dry and cold, Is aged soone: So women more then men Soone meete with age, which makes some be so bold (As vnder Paint the face. Coulor that they are wo-men) To keepe off Age till they be Bis puer. yong agen. The Aire wee breath may hast? our age.The Aire we breath doth beare an Ore herein, And being subtil moves the simple Minde; For, never yet was foole a Florentine, (As by the wise hath well observed byn) So subtill is the Aire hee draweth in: The influences of malignant Starres, Causes of the Aiers putrification &amp; consequently of grosse witte. Vales, Caves, Stanckes, Moores, and Lakes that never ryn Carion, and filth, all such the Aier marres, Which killes the Corpes, and vvitts Carreër barres. From Regions, VVinds, &amp; st?ding of the place Where we abide, come the Aires qualities; Vnder the Poles (the Sun nere showing face But as a stranger) the Aire so doth freeze That whosoever breathes it, starving dies: And in the Torrid Zone it is so hott That flesh and Bloud (like flaming fire) it fries, And with a Cole-blacke beautie it doth blott, Curling the Haires vpon a vvyry knott. The winds, though Aire, yet Aire do turne &amp; wind; The passions of the Aier do affect our Minds. VVhich Passions of the Aire, our sp'rits affect; These by the Nose and Mouth a waie doe finde To Braines, and Hart, and there their kindes effect, And as they are, make them, in some respect: For, where the VVindes be cold and violent, (As where rough Boreas doth his Throne erect) There are the People stronge, and turbulent, Rending the Sterne of civill government. The situation of the place likewise The situation of the Place makes the Aier good or badde. The Aire therein doth wel or ill dispose; If to the Sea, or Southerne winde it lies, It's humid, putrifactiue, &amp; too close: So fares it in fatt grounds (Slouthes chiefe repose) The Sandy grounds doe make it hott and dry; As cold, and moist it is, that Fennes inclose, But cleere &amp; piercing on the Mountaines hy; Thus Place with Aire doth ch?g our quality. Foode good or badd, helpes or hinders Witte.Of no lesse vertue are our Alements, Which VVinde, &amp; Aire, vnto our sp'rits prepare, VVho are conformed to those Condimentes; Then fine they be, if most fine be our fare: The Goodnesse, Quality, and Time of yeare, Vse, Order, Appetite, and Quantity, The Howre and Age, these nyne require our care If we desire to liue heere healthfully, And make the Soule aboue her soule to fly. The soone concocted Cates good iuyce affoording And but few excrements, are those alone That make the mind to boord, when Bodi's boording, If temp'ratly the stomacke take each one: These in the Braines base witts doe oft enthrone: For, these the Mouth prepareth for the Maw, VVhere be'ng concocted, to the Liver runne; From whence, a sanguine tincture they doe draw, Then to the Soules Courts hie by Natures lawe. The Hart's the lower house, the The Hart &amp; Brayne. head the hie; (The Roomes whereof we did discribe whil-ere) Where once appearing they are wing'd to fly, And in their flight the Soule and Body steere With motion such as both Cœlestiall were: What mervell is it then, though Geese some be For want of Capons, that would Cocks appeare (Cocks of the Game) and chaunt melodiouslee, If with their kinde, their Commons did agree. How subtill doth a simple cupp of VVine Make the Soules faculties, and their effects? It makes their divine natures more divine, And with a world of Ioy the Hart affects Which, Sorrow though in panges of Death reiects: Hence comes it that some Captaines doe carrowse When they must Wine moderatly taken cheeres the Hart &amp; spirits. Combate with contrary Sects, To heate the cold bloud and the spirits rowse, And so make Courage, most couragious. But here (as erst was saide) some over drinke, While they desire in fight to over-doe; On nought but wo?ds, &amp; bloud, they speake, &amp; think, While Healthes goe ro?d, &amp; braines goe ro?der too; VVyne-making Bloud to VVine &amp; Bloud them wooe. But Nequid nimis, is the List wherein Courage should combate, and the Barre whereto Valor should venter, what is more is sinne, Which by the wise and Valiant damn'd hath bin. Drincke hath three; offices, the first assists 3. Offices of Drinke. Concoction, for in it is boil'd the meate: The next, to mixe the foode the first disgests: The Last, to bring it to the Livers heate, There to be made redd-hott, &amp; apt to fleete: Now when the Current is too violent, It beares awaie (vntimely) small, and greate, So crossing Nature in her kinde intent, She back Yomitte. retires not knowing what she m?t. Then meate must soak, not in the Stomacke swimme, If Nature duely we desire to please; For, when the Stomack's Gluttony &amp; Drunkenesse are he horrible sepultures of mans reason &amp; iudgment. full aboue the brimme, Tyde tarries none, how ere it may disease And Nature drowne in those vnruly Seas: Breath most corrupt, behaviour more then most, And Mind much more then most, is made by these; Then how corrupt are they that of it boast? So much corrupt they may infect an Hoast. Its said of one, that did help to behead The mounting Monastries that deckt this land, That he (at last) lost his all-wittie Head For words he spake, to which he could not stand, Nor stand to speake, VVine having vpperhand: Who vsd (as Fame reports) his wits t'refine, To let them often rest at VVines commande; But wit abused, by abuse of VVine Abusd One that forc'd Law to force his fine. Now as a moderation in these things With Iudgements choise in their varieties, Temperate exercise available to minde and bodie.To Soule, and Body, health, and glorie brings; So both are bound to temp'rate exercise For helping them to vse their faculties: For without health the same were hindered, And health from hence as from an helpe doth rise; For holesome labour breakes those humors head By which the enemies of health are led. Natural heateIt helpes the heate that helpeth all the parts; The Spirits it quickens, and puts ope the pores; Whereby each loathsome excrement departs As at so many straight wide-open dores: Our limbes it strengthens and our breath restores: The morning walkes to the intestines send The first digestions filth (which kinde abhorres) And make the seconds to the bladder wend, So labour lets our sicknesse, so, our end. All travell tendes to rest, and rest to ease; Then must the bodie travell to this end: The Sons of Adam, borne to labour.The Spirits travell hath respect to these; For idle Spirits that actiue Sp'rit offend That for such ease a world of woe doth send: Yet naught was made that was not made to rest; But nought was made to rest vntill the end: For Heau'n, Earth, Man, Beast, Fish, Fowle, &amp; the rest Doe travell, in fine to be rest-possest. Yet Nature hath ordained a repose Which we call rest for Man, which rest is sleepe; The cause whereof from the Braines cheefly floes, When mounting vapors in their moisture steepe Doe humors wax, and in the Nerves doe creepe; And so their conducts close, which shuts the eies; Then rests the corpes in death-like darknesse deepe, And Spirits animal Rest doth surprise: So, are they said to rest vntill they rise. This makes the head so heavy after meate, The fumes ascending make the head descend; For they like hammers on the braines doe beate, Til they haue hammerd humors in the end, The weight whereof doth cause the head to bend: Yet sober sleepes, in place, and season fit Doe comfort Nature, and her hurts amend; The Spirits it quickens, and awakes the wit, For hart must sleepe, when the head wanteth it. Dead sleepe, Deathes other name and Image true, Doth quiet Passion, calme Griefe, Time deceiue; Who pay'ng the debt that is to Nature due (Like death) in quittance thereof doth receiue Supply of powres, that her of powre bereaue: So sleepe her foes wants friendly doth supply, And in her wombe doth wakefull thoughts conceiue, Making the Minde beyond it selfe to spie, Divinity oft in dreames For, doubtlesse Dreames haue some divinitie. For, as the influence of Heavens leames Frames diverse formes in matter corporall: A natural reason, for the divinity of Dreames.So of like influence visions and Dreames Are printed in the powre fantasticall; The which power being instrumental, By Heav'n disposd to bring forth some effect, Hath greatest vigor in our sleepes extreames; For when our mindes doe corporall cares neglect That influence doth freely them affect, And so our Dreames oft future haps proiect. VVatching oremuch, oremuch doth Nature wrong, It blunts the braines, and sense debilitates; Dulleth the Spirits, breedes crudities among; Makes the head heavie, Body it abates, Over much watching debilitates our wittes.And kindely heate it cooles, or dissipates: Yet thorny cares, or stings of ceaslesse Smart, May keepe out sleepe without the senses Gates, (By pricking them as it were, to the hart) Till vitall Sp'rits from senses quite depart. Those Chieftaines, on whose cares depend the crowns (The waighty crownes, on their as waighty cares) Of mighty Monarches, and their owne renownes, Two burdens which in one who ever beares, This waking care breaketh the sleepe, as a great sickenesse breakes the sleepe. Eccle 31 2.Must night, and day, vse hands, legs, eies, and eares: These watch, yea sleeping wake for in their sleepes The point on which their harts are fixt, appeares, And through their closed eies their minds eie peeps, To looke to that which them from slumber keepes. Their sleepes are short, but were they short, &amp; sweet, Care enemy to sleepe and sleepe c?forter of Care. Nature would longer sweetly life support: But in their sleepes with wakfull thoughts they meete; That make their sleepes vnsweet, and yet as short; Which must perforce make Nature all amort: Care a C?ker to Minde and Body. Yet as they were all Minde, and Body none, That had noe feeling of the Bodies hurt, That Minde (all mind) though Corpes the while doth grone, Makes flesh all hardnesse brooke, as it were Stone. Such force hath worldly glory (though but vaine) To make men, for her love, themselues to hate, Who for desire of her, their strength doe straine Farre, farre aboue the pitch of mortall state, And paine in sense, to sense doe captivate: Though pains wake s?se, yet sense doth waking sleep, Dreaming on Glory in the lapp of Fate; So paine fr? sense, doth paine with pleasure keepe, While sense is mo?ting Honors Mountaine steepe. VVhere Glory sitts enthron'd (Cœlestial Dame) Surrounded with a Ring of Diadems, VVith face (whose beaming-beautie seemes to fl?e) Darting in simling wise those blissefull beames On those that for her The laboure of like Bodies be not a like painfull. For glory in a Prince makes the laboure lighter then that of a Pesant, because he wotes it wil be notable. loue brooke all extreames: VVhat Sense hath sense being so beheavened, And carried from it selfe on pleasures Streames? But as entranc'd with ioy, it must seeme deade, And feele no paine in Minde or Body bredd. If then Vaine-glories loue shall so subdue The sense to sense that feeling all annoy, Its arm'd to brooke the same by glories view, And the more griefe is felt, the greater ioy; (Yea though the grife the s?se doth quight destroy) VVhat shall the loue of Glory infinite Make sense endure, if sense her powers imploie To apprehend it, as its requisite? Such love should hold the paines of Hell too light. When vnconceaved Ioy dilates the Hart To th'vtmost reach of his capacitie, When sense no leasure hath to thinke on smart, Being so busied with felicity That soule, and sense are ravished thereby; What marvell then though fire doth comfort such, (Although with qu?chlesse flames their flesh it fry) Sith that much Inward ioy annihilates outward paine. pain their ioy makes more th? much And paine, that sense can feele, no sense can touch. This made a woodden Esay the Prophet so martired. Sawe sweete to the flesh wherewith it sundred was in savage wise: This makes the burning S. Lawrence. Grediorne flesh refresh That on the same in hellish manner fries, This makes paine pleasure, and Hell Paradise. Then give me, ô good giver of all good, An Hart that may ore paine thus signiorize, For thy deere love; then with my deerest blood Ile wash the Earth, and make more Saints to budd. When Stones (as thicke as haile) from hellish hands Battr'd that blessed S. Stephen. Act 7. 56, 58. Proto-Martyres braine, The sight he saw his senses so commands, That, as the Stones did fal the sense to paine, It deem'd that Grace on it did pleasure raine: And that deere blood, like-worthlesse water shedd, Did make the springing Church to sprout amaine; One Martyr begets many.For that no sooner was this Martyr dead But many (as from him) came in his steede. And that the Elements doe loose their force (That by such losse their Lord might lovers win) It wel appeares; for, did he not divorce The heate from fire, which his deere Saints were in? Some too wel knew that this perform'd hath bin: For out it flew and brent their enemies, And where it first began, it did begin The powre thereof with powre to exercise, Dan. 3. 22, 23. To shew his powre, that loth'd their sacrifice. Now, to retire from whence our Rimes doe range, And touch the soule, &amp; minds mind at the soule; We see the bodies state the minde may change; So may the minde the bodies state controule; Thus they the state of one another rule: The soules soule is the minde, and the mindes minde Is that, where Reason doth her lawes enrowle: Yet fuming Passions both of them may blinde, When body, with them both are ill inclin'd. Phillipides, that comedies compil'd Orecoming one that with him did contend In that light Art, (when hope was quite exil'd) Sorrow doth occupie the the place of extreame ioy. Petrarch. A suddaine ioy wrought his as suddaine end. Like fate did one Diagoras attend, Who, see'ng his three sonnes at Olimpus crown'd For deedes there done (which All did much c?mend) Extreme ioy (being suddaine) is enemy to nature. He them embracing, straite fell dead to ground, Because his ioy was more then hart could bound. As extreame suddaine ioy doth kill the hart, Leaving it bloudlesse which is ioies effect Simil. (For ioy sends bloud amaine to ev'ry part) So, extreame griefe the hart may so affect (Or suddaine feare) that life may it reiect; For both revoke the sp'rites, bloud, and kind heate, And to hartes Center doe the same direct, Which place bee'ng little, and their throng so great, Expels the Vitall spirits from their seate. Marc Lepidus, divorced from his wife Whom he intirely lou'd, with extreame griefe (For it conceav'd) he quickly lost his life; So loue rest life, that erst was lifes reliefe, For loue of that his woe was fountaine chiefe. So, with a suddaine feare haue many died Which name I neede not, sith I would be briefe: By it the haires haue suddainely bin died, As by graue writers is exemplifide. Of no lesse force (though lesse the reason be) Is shamefastnesse, in some of mighty minde: Shame may bring life to confusion in generous spirits.One Diodorus died because that hee Could not assoile a Question him assign'd: The like of Homer we recorded finde; Who died with shame for being so vnsound Not to be able (like one double blinde) Quod capio perdo, quod non capio mihi seruo.To answere that, base Fishers did propound; So sense of shame did sense and life confound. These Passions are the suffrings of the soule, Body &amp; SouleThat make the Inne to suffer with the Ghest: For, Perturbations both togither rowle Here, there, and ev'ry where, as they thinke best; Heate naturall Kinde-heate they fire, or quench with their vnrest: For, some (as all obserue) haue died with ioy; And some with griefe, haue bin life-dispossest: For in extreames, they Nature so annoy, As (being suddaine) her they quite destroy. Yet Mirth in measure, kindly warmes the bloud, And spreads the Sp'rits, b'inlarging of the hart: This mirth in measure is the only moode That cuts the throat of Physicke, and her Art, And makes her Captaines from her coulors start; Phisitions. It makes our yeares as many as our haires: Mirth makes mans yeares as many as his haires. Then, on earths stage who play a meery part, Shall much more more th? much offend their heires By overlong prolonging their desires. Then, should I liue by Nature over long, For I to mirth by nature am too prone; But Accident in me doth nature wrong, By whom vntimely shee'l be overthrone: For Melancholy in my Soule inthrones Herselfe gainst Nature, through crosse Accident, Where shee vsurpeth, that is not her owne; And Nature makes to pine with discontent That shee should so be reft her regiment. Thus as the Corpes the qualities compound, So are th' Affections moist, dry, hot, and cold, The Affecti?s follow the qualities of the Humors. The last are humor'd as the first abound: Ioy (hot and moist) the Sanguine most doth hold, As sorrow (cold and dry) possesse the Olde. Meane ioie's a meane to make men moist, and hot, In which two qualities Health hath her Hold: But griefe the heat consumes, and bloud doth rot, Which health impaires, and cuts lifes Gordian knot. And as meane mirth mans age maks most extreame; So doth it cloth the bones with frolicke flesh: For, to the partes it makes the bloud to streame, Which makes them grow, &amp; doth th? ioy-refresh; This mirth the hart must haue when head is fresh, For wyny mirth proceedeth from excesse; Sicknesse is (as Seneca saith) the chastisement of intemper?ce. And all excesse doth but make nature nesh, Vnable to endure times long processe, How ere it may spend time in drunkennesse. This correspondence then twixt flesh, and sp'rite, Should make our Mouth the House of Temperance; For the Corpes qualities will answere right Her rule of Diet; Then intemperance, The Head and Hart doth odiously entrance: The Hares affects begett the MindesThe Hartes affects, produce the Heades effects, Which make the Soule and Bodies concordance: Then sith the Bodie breeds the Soules affects, The Soule should feede the same with right respects. Respect of Health, respect of name, and fame, Depending on our moderation, Should be of force to make vs vse the same; But, when the Bodies depravation Toucheth the soule, and bothes damnation, All these respectes should (being things so deere) Deere are fatted but to be killed; So Epicures &amp;c.Inflame Desires immoderation Coldly to vse hott wines &amp; belly cheere, For belly-gods are but the Divells Deere. Sith sicknesse then in bodie, and in soule, From tempers ill, and ill affections flo, VVitt ought VVills appetites to over rule VVhen they (to follow sense) fr? Reason go; And bring them to the bent of wisdoms Bo: For, sith our soules by Knowledge things discerne, From whence the will hath pow'r of willing too, The power of The will is derived from Knowledge.If Knowledge then be to them both a Sterne, They should do nought but what of her they learne. And so they doe, but their Guide being blinde Of the right Eie, no mervel though they runne Too much on the left hand from place assign'd, Directed by Delight, the senses sunne: But Cloudes of sinne our Knowledge over-runne, Which make her run awrie in rightest vvaies, Whereby our silly soules are oft vndunne, VVhen as shee weenes to winne immortall praise, And crowne her Craft with everlasting Baies. Who learnes a trade, must haue a time to learne; For without time an Habit is not gain'd: So diverse skills the soule cannot discerne, Practise the Mother of Habit. Vntill they be by exercize obtain'd, For by it onely Habittes are attain'd: VVhich Habitts stretch not onely to our Deedes, But to our suffrings, beeing wrong'd, or pain'd, For Customes force another Nature breedes, And pyning soule with patience it feedes. Vnto a soule impatient (seldome crost) Each Daie a yeare, each yeare an Age doth seeme; The Soule is possest in patience, if shee possesse patience. But a meeke soule with troubles often tost, The time, though long, doth ordinarie deeme; For Time and Troubles she doth light esteeme: This well appeares in sicknesse, (though most ill) At first we still doe worst of it misdeeme, But staying long with vs, we make our vvill Familiar with it, so endure it still. Afflictions water cooles the heate of sinne, And brings soule-health; But at the first like frost It soule benummes, as it were starv'd therein, And sense, and Life and sp'rit thereby were lost: The Crosse doth quell to Hell the seldome crost: Hence is it, Christ doth with his Crosse acquaint Those that be his, whereof they glory'ng boast, For that the Crosse wel borne creates the Saint, Frst the crosse and then the Crowne. As it to Fiendes transformeth them that faint. Affliction, Ladie of the happy life, (And Queene of mine, though my life happlesse be) Give my Soule endlesse peace, in endlesse strife, For thou hast powre to giue them both to me, Because they both haue residence in thee: Let me behold my best part in thine Eies, That so I may mine imperfections see; And seeing them I may my selfe despise, For that selfe-love, doth from selfe-liking rise. Enfold me in thine Armes, and with a kisse Of coldest comfort, comfort thou my hart; Breath to my Soule, that mortified is, Immortall pleasure in most mortall Smart: Be ieloues of me, play a Louers part: Keepe Pleasure from my sense, with sense of paine, And mixe the same with pleasure by thine Arte; That so I may with ioy the griefe sustaine, Which ioye in griefe by thy deere loue I gaine. When from our selves we are estranged quite, (Though it be strange, we so estrang'd should be) Thou mak'st vs Affliction being familier with vs, doth make vs most familier with our selues. know our selves at the first sight And bring'st vs to our selves, our selues to see; So that we throughly know our selues by As a man c?not know him selfe, if hee know not God so he cannot know God well if hee know not him selfe. So inseperable are these knowledges thee: But bright Voluptu'snesse doth blinde our Eyes That we can nothing see, (and lesse foresee) But what within her gaudy Bozome lies, Being a Mappe of glorious miseries.

The first, with downe-cast lookes stil eie the Mould, As waying whence they came, &amp; where they must: The second, with high lookes the Cloudes behold, To see how they for place and grace doe thrust, Like these vngratious proude Oppressors iust: Quiett and sadd the first doe still appeare, The other Ample fortunes, haue as ample passi?s. madde with mirth, for Prov. 13. 10. quarells lust; Affliction thus to God doth Soules indeere, When welfare makes them to the Devill deere.

Then though Affliction be no welcome Ghest Vnto the world (that loues nought but her weale) Of me, therefore shee shalbe loved best, Because to me shee doth the VVorld reveale, Which worldly welfare would from me conceale: Affliction is the best Tutresse to make vs know the World.It is a gaineful skill the VVorld to know, As they can tel that with the VVorld doe deale, It cost them much ere proofe the same doth show, Which knowledge fr? Afflicti? streight doth flow. And though the entrance into Vertues way Be straite, so strait that few doe enter in, Yet being entred, walke with ease we may, For labour endes when vve doe but begin: “Sweat before Vertue lacky-like doth rin To ope the gate of Glory sempiterne, That her triumphant coach might enter in; So outward temp'ral toile 'gets blisse eterne Vpon the corpes of Vertue most interne. Custom is another nature. Custom is overcome by custome.Sith Custome then is of such liuely force As it hath powre it selfe to overcome, How blest are they that doe themselues divorce From Custome ill, by force of good custome: And ten times blessed they that from the VVombe Accustom'd are to Vertues straightest VVay, For, such by Custome vertuous become, Though powreful Nature doe her selfe say nay; For Nature, Customes powre is forc'd t'obay. When, the affections are called vertues or Vices.When the Affections Acts are habits growne, Then Vertues or els Vices are they nam'd; A vicious Habit's hardly overthrowne, For our Affection is therewith enflam'd, As with the fire infernall are the damn'd: Who though they would, and though they anguish haue, Yet cannot that outragious mood be tam'd, But still they raging sin, and cannot saue Themselues from that, that makes their griefe their graue. A vicious Habit is Hels surest Gin, Wherewith a Man is sold to sinne, and shame, Running from sinne to sinne, and nought but sinne, As Rivers runne the same, and not the same. Til the mindes Iointes, sinnes force doth so vnframe That it becomes most loose and dissolute; Neither regarding heav'n, hell, shame, nor fame, But to liue loathsomly its resolute; Thus Habits ill, make evill absolute. But few there are in whom all vice concurres; And fewer are they, that all faults doe want; Vnto the worst, offences cling like Burres; And to the best as to the Adamant The Iron cleaues; for the Church militant By nature is accompanied with sinne; Yet the least force of faith partes them (I grant) Sin inhabites, but is not habituall in the godly. Because it cleaues but sleightly to the skinne, But to the wickeds flesh its fastned in. For as a burre the longer it abides Simil. Vpon a garment being cott'nd hy, The more the VVooll windes in his hooked sides: So sinne the longer it in Flesh doth ly, The faster to the same its fixt thereby. If Nature then sinne soone doth entertaine, Vse violence to Nature by and by, That it perforce may from the same refraine; For what skill cannot, force may yet constraine. Simil.And as the Burre to VVoll so being fixt, With skill, or force cannot be parted thence, But that some part will with the VVooll be mixt: So, sinne where it hath had long residence, Simil.Will leaue remaines there, maugre violence: But Iron from the loadstone cleane will fall With but a touch: and so wil sinnes offence From those in whom its not habitual With but a touch of Faith, though nere so small. That I may touch the Subiect of my Rimes More home, (though homely I the same doe touch) And for, my travell'd Muse might breath somtimes, And, that the Reader too might doe as much, (Lest that prolixitie might make him grutch) Here shall shee make a stande, and looke a-backe, Simil.As Riders rancke on Steepes haue customes such To breath their bony-Nags, when winde they lacke, And courage them againe like toile to take. In knowing our soules, we know the wel head of al our Actions. The knowledge of the Soule, and of her Powres, Is the well-head of morrall VVisedomes flood: Hence know we al (worth knowing) that is ours, In body, or in Soule, that's ill or good: And if these Powres be rightly vnderstoode, We know the founts from wh?ce our Actions slow, And from what cause proceedeth ev'ry moode, Or good, or ill, and where that cause doth grow; Al this and more, this knowledge makes vs know. For in the Soule doth shine (though sinne-obscur'd) By Natures light, great light of such science; Whereby the Soule is made the more assur'd In all her Actions, and Intelligence; Though oft deceav'd by seeming goods pretence: And for the Soule is to the body bound, Affections therein haue their residence, That, as with wings, the soule with th? might bo?d, Aboue her selfe from being bloud y drown'd. Wherefore shee hath Affections of two kinds, The Minde turns &amp; winds the body by the Affections of the Hart. The one eggs on, the other doe restraine, By which the Minde the body turnes and windes, As they the mind, and minde the Corpes constraine: Yet wh? these Curbs our head-strong nature paine, It winceth with the Heele of willfull-will; Orethrowing those Affects that doe it reigne, And in extremities it runneth still, Which is the Race of Ruine, Rest of Ill. This comes to passe when as we overpasse The bounds of Nature, by our Natures vice; And in some one excesse we do surpasse, Desiring more then Nature may suffice, To which our corrupt natures vs intice: For let the least Necessity appeere A ken from vs, (though neere so smal of price) Little suffiseth Nature, but nothing Opinion. We hold what els we hold, (though nere so deere) VVorthlesse, and for that want with woe we steere. As a little Colloquintida doth marre a whole pot of pottage: so covetousnesse doth make all other vertues abhominable. The best vse of worldly things is to contemne worldly things. Plato. Hence is it that with never-ceasing toile, And no lesse care, we traverse all this All; Nay, all that All we restleslie turmoile, And bandy (as it were) this Earthie Ball Past reasons reach, to win worlds wealth withal: Desire of having thus still moiles the minde, Though Nature be suffis'd with pittance small; VVhich makes vs loose our selues when wee it finde, Sith see our selues we cannot, being blinde. It blinds our Eyes that seldom'st are deceav'd, Eyes of our Soule, that make our Bodies see; Then Soule and Bodie cannot be perceav'd, By their owne vertue when they blinded be; And mine and thine, doth sever mee, and thee: Nought can content vs. Therefore the Affects Are in the soule like windes (that nere agree) Vpon the Sea, and worke the like effects, Some great, some smal, yet like in most respects. Beside the chiefe windes and Collaterall, (Which are the VVindes indeede of chiefe regard) Sea-men observe more, thirtie two in all, Al which are pointed out vpon their Carde: But our Minds Mapp, (though many may be spar'd) Containeth many more Affects then these, All which though sett our Minds Content to guard, Yet sturr they vp (as VVindes doe on the Seas) Vnquiet Passions which the Minde disease. A simil.When Zephire breathes on Thetis, she doth smile, Shee entertaines that gale with such content; But, if proude Boreas doe puffe the while, Shee's madd with rage, and threates the Continent; For those proud puffes her soule doe discontent: So, some Affections our soules browes vnbend, And other some doe sextiply each dent; Some meanely please, some meanely doe offend, And some doe make the Soule her Soule to rend. Those that doe meanely moue, Affections hight; The other Huff-snuffes Affections move the Soule moderately, but Perturbations move her most violently. Perturbations be; These later rudely gainst their Guides doe fight, And so enfume them that they cannot see, Or make them from their Charge away to flee: So that the soule being left without a Guide, And tost with Passions that still disagree, Doth like a Sternelesse Shippe at randon ride On mightiest Seas, wrack-threatn'd on each syde. A Simil. For, if our Reasons iudgment blinded be, Th' Affections needes must ever run When Iudgm?t is betraid, the Affections are misguided. awrie, And draw with th? each sense tumultuoslee To offer violence to lowe and hye; That God, and Nature, tast their tyranny: Let but the Hart bee loue-sicke, and the same Will carry Iudgment where his Loue doth ly; And there confine it, setting all on flame That offers but resistance once to name. The lower Iudgment in our blood is sunck The lower is her reach in Reas'ns discourse; For Iudgm?t with our blood may be so dr?ck, That doome she cannot better fr? the worse, But (reeling too and fro) is reft of force. Therfore moderate fasting feedes the Soule. The higher therfore, she her selfe doth reare Aboue base Flesh &amp; Blood's declining course, The more Affections basenesse wil forbeare, And neerer draw to that that first they were. For, Passions passing ore that break-neck Hill Of Rashnesse, ledd by Ignorance their guide, By false Opinions Hold of Good and Ill Taking their course, at last with vs abide, While fr? our selves they make our selues to slide: So that we seeke not that sole sov'raigne Good, But many Goods we seeke; which being tride Doe but torment the Minde with irefull Ills tak? for good, grieue the mind vpon triall. moode, Because they were by her mis-vnderstoode. Had we the prudence of the brutish kinde, We would prev?t these Passions Stormes with ease; For, ere a Storme appeares they shelter finde; Like providence haue Sea-men on the Seas, VVho see them farre off, and provide for these: So ought we, when we see a Passion Passion is easiest extinguished when it begins to kindle. rise That may the Soule, and Body much disease, VVith Moderations pow'r the same surprize, Before it gather head to tyrannize. But, so farre off are we from curbing Passion, That wilfully we mount it, and so ride On it a gallopp (spurr'd with Indignation) To all Extreames, where Vices all abide; The Divell being extreame Passions guide: For once wh? Reasons driven fr? the Helme, And we twixt Scylla and Charibdis glide, Ther is no hope but one should overwhelme, And send vs straight to the infernal Realme. But with a prudent Man it fares not so, He keeps himself without th' Affecti?s A wise man rules, and is not ruled by his Affections. sway; He seekes no good, but he it wel doth kno, And knowing it, seekes it the rightest way: VVe say, and misse, because we mis-asay: VVisdom chalks out the way her selfe to find, So that Men cannot erre if it they waie, Except they be (as many) wilfull blinde, For it is straight, though strict in easie kinde. VVisedome (the VVell of ev'ry perfect good) Is that, which wise men onely (seeking) finde; VVhich Constancie holdes the Hart that holds wisd?e. constant good they seeke in const?t moode, And being found, most constant makes the Minde: For to the same, it selfe, it selfe doth binde: Heerehence it is, the clowds of Ignorance That erst the same did naturally blinde Away are chased, without tarriance; For VVisedomes Sonne, himselfe doth there advance. Thus good, and ill (as erst we said) procure The Mindes Affects, or Moodes, (so cald by some) VVhich good, or evill, pure, or most impure, Is either past, or present, or to come, To be attain'd, or not be overcome: And, as we deeme the absence of good, ill: So, absent Ill, wee deeme doth good become; Ill is the privation of good. Either of which affecteth so our VVill, That by their meanes it is in motion still. When any good's propounded to the soule, Shee notes, shee likes, and lastly it doth loue, But in her Mouth shee often it doth rowle, That so her Pallate may thereof approue, Before it can her Soules affection moue: This motion of possessed good is Ioy; But good to come (which we doe long to proue) Is call'd Desire, which loue doth still imploy Good is the obiect of loue and Desire. To seeke that good which it would faine enioie. If Ill proposed be, its call'd Offence, Because the soule offended is thereby; If it abides, Hate doth her soule incense; For shee a lasting ill hates mortally, As that which most her soule doth damnisie: And, as from present Ill, Griefe doth aspire: So, Feare proceedes from Ill farre off or ny: The moode gainst present Ill is sinnelesse Ire, To bee angry with evill, is good. And Faith, and Hope, gainst future Ill conspire. All which Affects haue others vnder them; For Rev'rence, Pitty, and Benevolence, Spring out of Loue, (as Braunches from the Stemme) From Ioy, Delight; Dislike, from sorrowes sense; And in Desire, Hope hath her residence: Pride is a m?ster compounded of many Affections.But Prid's a Monster, for shee is compos'd Of Self-conceit, Desire, Ioy, Impudence; These, and such like in Pride are oft disclos'd, For in her wombe they restlesse are repos'd. And, as Affections one another breede, By one another so are they restrain'd: Ioy woundeth Griefe, &amp; Griefe makes Ioy to bleede; And so the rest are by the rest refrain'd, As by the Stronge the vveaker are constrain'd: A Simil.As when curst Thetis chiding knitts the Brow, Her Billowes proud, that eithers pride disdaine, Thrusts out each other: So, when Passions flow, The greater doe the lesser overthrow. A Simil.And oft it fares in our Mindes Common-weale, As in a Civill-warre the case doth stande; Where no mann's careful of his Countries heale, Or who of right should al the rest commaund, But follow him that hath the strongest hand: So, in Affections fight ther's no respect To the Mindes good, or how it should be scand, But (inconsiderate) they both reiect, And doe as strongest Passion doth Where Passion raignes Reason obayeth. direct. The Hart, the Hold where these Pow'res are inclos'd, Heereby is vext; for, if it doe incline To those Affections that are worst dispos'd, Its inly griv'd, els Ioy the same doth line, And with the same doth face the Face in fine; But, if sadd sorrow doe the Hart surprise, It doth deface the face and make it pyne; Looking like Languishment through both the Eyes, For through the The Eie is the Index of the Minde. Eyes, our Eye the Hart espies. This direct Index of the Minde, the Eyes Doth oft bewraie what Reason doth conceale; For wil yee, nil yee, we shal see thereby What's well, or ill, in the Mindes common-weale: Eccl. 13. 25. Our Lookes, our Falshoode truely doe reveale, Whereby oft lives and liberties are lost; Examin'd Theeves Confounded looks bewray m?s, lewdnes. confesse that they did steale By their confused lookes, with horror tost: Thus Count'naunce oft putts vs to double cost, It Lyvings costs, to hold it beeing hy, It costs our lives, when we it cannot hold; We cannot hold it when through it we dye; And two Proppes hold it high, Silver and Gold, For which oure lives, and livinges oft are sold: For too lowe State too false doth make the hands, Which in the Countenance wee oft behold, Through which we die; and State that highly stands Lands must vphold; So, it costs life and lands. Thus Ioy and Sorrowe send with equal pace True tokens of their presence in the Hart, (By Natures force conducted) to the Face; Where they the powr's convince of Reasons Arte, And in the The counten?ce showes how the Hart is affected. Front with force they play their part: If in the Hart, Griefe be predominant, The browes wil bend as if they felt the smart; If Ioy, the face wil seeme therefore to vant, Then how Hart fares, Fooles are not ignorant. That Man is truely wise as Man may bee, That can beare weale, &amp; woe, with like aspect; There may be such, but, such I nere could see; Yet good mens countenance I much respect, But of their goodnes nere saw that effect: Let Stoicks giue for præcepts what they list, This vertue may (perhapps) be their defect; For though Affections force they can resist, Yet they'l prevaile wh? Natures powres assist. And weakling that I am, how apt am I To martial al my Passions in my face; Not to dissemble, is not to lyue.I oft haue tride, and yet I doe but trie, To keepe them in, in their conceaving place, Dissembling so Discretions fowle disgrace: But as I cannot colour my defects, So, can I wel dissemble in no case; Which is the cause of many badd effects, For none (though nere so vaine) this vaine affects. Teares are the Tokens of a Passion'd Soule, That Hart for Loue somtimes sends to the Eies, And oft they witnes there Ioy, Paine, or Dole, But how so ere, from Passion strong they rise; Which Passion in Compassion often lies: Mine Eies are kyn (too neere of kyn) to these, Which, though my Spirit doth it much despise, Yet doe they turne mine Eyes too oft to Teares quench the fire of immoderate Passi?. Seas, To drowne Harts Passion and to give it ease. But blessed were I if mine Eyes could flowe With Teares of Pittie seeing the distrest; But much more blest, had I then to bestow And franckly giue, then were I treble blest; In Teares, in wealth, and in both so addrest: My Secret to my selfe, I blesse Him ay For being no worse, though badd I be at best; The lesse I speake of what I feele that way, The more I feele his grace my thoughts to sway. He, Fount of goodnesse (holie be his name) Was often seene (when he as man was seene) To weepe, and seem'd delighted with the same, Seeing the VVorld (through his Teares) stil oreseene, That might by his example blest haue beene: Who never was observ'd to laugh, or iest, Either in Manhood, or when yeares were greene, At merry-meetings, or at vveddings feast; Showing thereby what moode fitts Vertue best. If Ioy at any time had toucht his Soule, (As when his words had made a Proselite) He (only wise) would wisely it controule, For that this moode with Mirth is too light for the gravity of Maiestie. Maiesty doth fight, Which in his Person was enthron'd by right: This we admire as that we cannot doe, For, we in pleasures vaine so much delight, That Ioy may make vs madd, and kill vs too: For Ioy, or Griefe can our hart-stringes vndoe. Thus when our Teares doe testifie our ruth, We neede not rue, or of them be asham'd; For, Vertue therein her owne selfe ensuth, When with selfe-love her Soule is most inflam'd, Which selfe loue burns the Soul yet nere is Vertues self-loue alone is Vertuous. blam'd: Wherefore such Teares, and Teares effus'd for sinne, Is wyne of Angels, so by Angells nam'd; Then blessed are those Founts that never lyn To send forth streames, that Angells glory in. When sighes for sinne ascend Mercy descends, And in the rise, their flight anticipates; Grace centreth sighes that Mercy comprehends, But sighes from sinne ascending Mercie hates; Sighes for, and from sinne, are vnequall mates: From sinne, none but sighes sinneful can arise; But sighes for sinne high grace consociates, The kingdom of heaven suffers violence; and the violent take it by force Mat. 11. 12.And did not Mercie stay them in the rise, They would with violence the Heav'ns surprise. Two kindes of Ioy or Griefe the Hart conceaues, For Good, or Ill, possessed, or future; The Hart c?ceaues two kindes of Ioy or Griefe.The name of Hope, the later Ioy receaues, Which of some good to come doth vs assure; The latter Griefe doth Feare in vs procure Of Ill to come, which we with Griefe expect: So, Ioy, and Hope, or Griefe, and Feare in powre Are much alike, their ods Time doth effect, And take their names as they doe Time respect. Hope time to come respects, bred by Desire, Desire of good, wherein we Ioie by Hope; Likelyhood is the life of hope touching mundane matters. Hope hath no helpe of science but intire Rests on coniecture, which to doubt lies ope, And likelyhood giues her her vtmost scope: Yet Hope that's fixt on that all-working VVord That gaue Earth being, and the Heav'nly Cope, Excludes Coniecture, and is so assur'd, As if that hopt for, Time did straite afford. Then no true Ioy can hope accompany, That hath but likelyhood for her best stay; For such hope, Posse evermore doth eie, Which ere it comes to Esse, slides away: For in each Possibilitie we may Behold a possibilitie of faile; Which must of force our hope sometimes dismay; Then Feare a shaking hope must needes assaile, And hope must shake, that crosse events may quaile. Such is the VVickeds most assured hope, The hope of the impious is full of feare. Who Ancor it on transitorie Toyes; They feare the cracking of that cable Rope That holds them to their hopes expected ioies; Contingencie their constan'st hope annoies; Which ay is constant in vnconstancie: And oft them with their groundlesse hope destroies; Which fils their hopes with dire perplexity, And lines their ioies with lasting miserie. But hope that hath for obiect certaine things (As those which Truthes nere-failing word assures) In great'st distresse great consolation brings, And like good sauce an appetite procures, Griese to disgest, as long as life endures: This hope makes harts to hold that els would breake; And harts almost quite broken shee recures, And when our foes by force our ruine seeke, Innocencie dreades no danger. She giues vs str?gth to weene their force too weake. Shee holds the powres of hell in high contempt, And makes a iest of temp'ral powre or paine; From all annoy of both shee is exempt, For in Griefes bowels shee doth ioie retaine; As Ionas did in the VVhales intertaine: The aire shee striketh with so strong a winge Hopes winges are pennipotent. That aire, or fire, the force cannot restraine, But vp shee will through both, and ev'ry thing That lets her from the place of her biding. Nay, she with such resistlesse wings doth flie, That shee her selfe her selfe doth oft surmount; The Patriarck Abraham.The Faithfuls Father made her so to stie, And diverse other Saintes of lesse account; Being on her VVings she, maugre force, wil mount, Who, through the ten-fold heav'ns (though thick &amp; hard) C? glide with ease, as Fish do through a fo?t, Nor by the high'st himselfe can shee be bard, Gen. 32. 26. 28But will prevaile, as it with Iacob far'd. Thus Ioy, and Hope goe iointly hand in hand, Like Twins got by Desire, by Fancie borne; And as Hopes ioie, on future Good doth stand, So, Fear's a griefe conceav'd for Ill vnborne (Which we expect) wherewith the Soule is torne: Then looke what ods there is twixt Hope and Ioy, The like's twixt Feare, and griefe (in minds forlone) A like they comfort, or the Minde annoy, As they best know, that best or worst enioy. Feare doth the Hart contract, (that Hope dilates) And shut so close that vitall Sp'rits it pines; Then Nature to prevent death (which shee hates) Drawes bloud and Sp'rits from al the parts confines, And to the Hart in haste the same assignes: Then are the outward partes, as pale, as cold, And quake as fearing their approaching fines; Then pants the heart that labours life to hold, Which ties the Tongue, womb loosing ere it should. And as this sense-confounding Passion, Feare, The hart with horror thus excruciates; So, in the soule it such a swaie doth beare, That it the Powres thereof quite dissipates; And makes most abiects, of most mightie States: How like an Idoll stands Feares servile Slaue? Whose total senses Feare so captivates, The Senses would dy, that feare might not liue. That no one sense hath force it selfe to saue, But Death desires to kill the feare they haue. If this base Feare (harts hatefull hel) possesse The hart, the hart doth then possesse the heele; But most of all, when hart doth most transgresse, And divine vengeance it (with feare) doth feele; Then Strength may seeke to stay it, but, t'wil reele In spight of morrall strength, that it should sway; And, as starke drunke with fear, turne like the wheele That wheeles the nether heauens without stay, Let courage say the while, what courage may. No harnesse (though by Vulcan forg'd) can make Feare is vtterly hartlesse. Feare to be hardy, or not hartlesse quite; If Armors could from Art such tempers take, The Artist should be king'd in Fortunes spight; For many kings would crowne him for this sleight: But he it is, whom heav'n, and hell doth feare, Can take feare from, and arme vs with his might; For he alone the faint-hart vp doth reare, Or make the stowtest hart most faint appeare. Wee must then armed be from Feare, by feare; Gods feare expels feare. Gods feare, that strong Vulcanian Armor, must Guard such good Soules as doe regard it heere; Because such feare is euer full of trust, Eccle. 1. 12. That feares no threate of any mortal thrust; For, Hope in him, doth make the dareing hart, Which hope no hart can haue that is vniust; For Conscience prickes will make the same to start When the least Leafe doth wagge, by winde, or Art: The Belly becomes loose though force of Feare.When therfore divine Iustice sinne wil scurge, He doth dishart their harts, in whom it raignes, In sort, that they themselves with horror Iob. 41. 16. purge, When he on them his heavy vengeance raynes; So that their feare exaggerates their paines. The haughti'st Hart (erst swolne with Valours pride) Feare striks stone-dead, wh? he but v?geance faines; And greatest strength by vveakenesse is defide, When as his pow'r in vveakenesse doth abide. Courage comes from Hope.Then, Courage comes from Hope, &amp; Hope fr? Heau'n, The Donor is the highest Diety; The praise is His, that is to prowesse giv'n, For he alone the Minde doth magnifie: Then praise him Lowe, if courage make you Hie; And laude him High, if feare make yee not lowe; Yea high and lowe praise Him alone, whereby You gaine the praise that men on you bestowe, From Whom (as fr? the Fount) al praise doth flowe. How is it then, that Divills in Mennes forme swaggring Six-penny Champions. Man-quellers are so desperate? Who with strong hand Gods Images deforme Fearing no man, but give the checke or mate To good and badd of whatsoever state: This is not courage, but an hellish fire That boiles their bloud, cal'd Ire, inflam'd by Hate, And oft of Saints they (Fiendes) haue their desire; Iob. 2. 7.No otherwise then Iob felt Sathans ire. Gen. 4 8.So, cursed Caine slue Abell in that moode, Abell, that Innocent the Highests belov'd; Yet Caine had hart and hand to broach his blood: The like, Men Angell-like haue oft approv'd By those whome God in this life nere reprov'd. This secret is obscure, but light to those That take it light, and it abide vnmov'd; Them Faith assures, He doth of all dispose; In whome, come life or death, they hope repose. If divine God. LOVE desires my Bodies death, By soddaine death my Soule so straight to haue, VVhat matters it, though he bereave my breath By Div'll, or Angell, so my Soule he saue; The God is the Fountaine of all Power. pow'r they both possesse, to them he gave, Both are his Ministers to doe his will; If Sathan then, my Corpes bring to the Grave, To me it is so farre from being ill, That Sathan doth me good, against his wil. Me good said I? well may I call it good, Sith it is good of goods, good all in all; The fount, whereof all goodnesse is the floud, That never yet was gag'd nor never shall By Men, most wise, or spirits Angelicall: It is th'Abysse of true Felicity, VVhich some men, more then most fantastical, Suppose they have, had they high dignity; VVith pleasure fac'd, and lyn'd with Misery. Thus Ioy, and Hope, were by th'all Giver giv'n As sweete Conductors to his sweetest Sweete; And Feare, and Griefe, from his wrath are deryv'n To awe the Mind, (which first therwith doth meete) And that which that Mind hath fore-done vnmeete, should be thereto as Sorrow remaines after sinne for sin, to make the Soule detest sinne. Scourge and Scouger iust, VVhich doe remaine, when sinnes sowre-Sweetes do fleete To make the Mind abhorre her former lust; For Griefe, and Feare, are iust to Mindes vniust. Now the true pleasure which our Nature craues The whiles the Soule remaines the Bodies Ghest, Is the true rest some Good the Soule vouchsaves, Which the Hart holdeth, and esteemeth best; As Contemplation is Reasons rest: Yet can there be no pleasure in that good If it be greater then Hart can disgest; For, if the Continent bound not the floud, Confusion must ensue in likely-hood. If Light (ioy of the Eye) be, as the Sunne, Too great for the Eyes small capacity, They may be dymmed so, if not vndunne: Or if it be too small, they cannot see; As they are strong or weake, so Too great Light is as offensive to the Eye, as too little. Light must bee: The like of other senses may be sedd Outward or inward, bound to forme, or free, Who must with moderation still be fedd, For excesse th? annoies, nay strikes th? dead. As therfore God is most most infinite, So hee's with ioy receaved of that part That's likst himself, which is the Soul or sp'rit; But for that he cannot himselfe impart (being Immense) to them by pow'r or arte, (they being not so) he is to them applied By God is by Intelligence apprehended of vs. Vnderstanding, yet but so in part; If otherwise he should with them abide, They would through glory be quite nullified. Now, as a man takes pleasure by these partes, So in that part he takes the most delight That to his Flesh, or sp'rite, most ioy imparts; And with those pleasures is he swallowed quight, That doe affect that part with maine and might: Therefore the brutish Vulgar, most are pleas'd In things substantial which appeare to sight, And things divine, which cannot so be seas'd, They hold as vaine, and are therewith displeas'd. Amonge the pleasures which are sensuall, The vilst is that we feele, by that we touch; Because it is the Earthli'st sense of all: The Tast's of better temper, though not much: Note which of the outward senses is the most supreme. Smelling is light, and lightly more will grutch At vnsweete Savors, then in sweete will ioye; The Hearing is more worthie farre then such, Sith its more Airey and doth lesse annoy, Whereby we gaine the Faith which we enioy. But Seeing, (Sov'raigne of each outward sense) Holds most of Fire, which is in nature neere To the Seeing is the Soveraigne of the outward S?ses &amp; why. Celestiall Natures radience; Therefore this sense to Nature is most deere, As that which hath (by Natures right) no Peere. Thus much for pleasures which these senses giue, VVhereof the best must needs most base appeare Compared to the worst our Soules receave, Whose powres haue much more pow'r to take and give. These are the Lures of lust, that never lyn To draw the vvorld to be a pray to vvoe; These make fraile flesh &amp; Blood the founts of The outward senses are the Dores where through Sin enters into our Soules. sinne, From whence all mortall miseries doe sloe, Which flesh and blood doe groning vndergoe; In these are Baites for Beggars, as for Kinges: VVhich pleasures streames doe (swelling) overfloe, That they are caught vnwares; so that these thinges The VVorld to Hell, and Hell to horror bringes. These are the windowes through which Sathan spies The disposition of our better part: Through these he hath a glimps of all that lies Within the secret'st corners of our Hart, The Divell knowes not the thoughts of Man.Which wel to know belongs to heav'nly Art: For loue of these, the Flesh the Sprite doth loth, Who for their pleasure makes the same to smart, And for their comfort soule and bodie both With Care confusedly themselues doe cloth. A Simil.As when grim Night puts on a Sable weede, Fac'd with infernal Apparitions, That so the next daies comfort might exceede: So, are the Minde and Bodies motions Care-cloth'd for senses consolations. Fraile senses (Seede-plots of impietie Made for our Reasons recreations) Die and bee damn'd, or liue to magnifie Your makers Mercie, Might, and Maiestie. And as in Pleasures false are true degrees, Agreeing with these Organs of the sense, Some base, some meane, some high, (for so are these) The inferiorst interior sense c?ceiues more pleasure then all the outward senses can.(Yet all but base to pleasures excellence, Whereof the soules low'st powre hath highest sense) So are there like gradations in the ioies Those Powres conceaue, as is their pre'minence; The feeding Powre, in feeding powre imploies, Which pleaseth Nature, but the soule annoies. The pleasures of the minde doe far excell those of the body.Those Ioies conceaved by th' Intelligence As most supreame, doe most reioice the sp'rite; For they belong to the supreamest sense, VVherein the Minde conceaveth most delight (Though Nature pine the while) by Natures right. Thus then, if iudgement these degrees would way, Shee would reiect ioie sensuall, as too light, And not permit the same her to betray, Which makes fraile sense the strongest Reason sway. The Gluttons Gorge (Charibdis of Excesse) Should (being disgorg'd) from surfetting forbeare: Th'insatiate Leacher would that fire suppresse, That Conscience and his secrets oft doth seare: None would be Beasts that humane creatures were. Then, sense of Touch or Tast, as vil'st they bee, So doe they bring the ioies that soonest weare; For those that come by that wee heare or see, Doe longer last, and with vs more agree. And the more base and brutish pleasures bee, The more brutish the pleasures bee, the more paine is taken in their execution. The more's the paine in their accomplishment; And the more vs'd they are excessiuely, The more's the soule and bodies dammagement; VVitnesse the Leachers lothsome languishment, The Drunkards dropsie, and the Gluttons Grease, Each clogg'd with either, or worse punishment, That health decreaseth with their corps increase, And shame increaseth with their fames decrease. Aske sensual-pleasure, in her greatest ruffe, How little griefe will overthrow her quite And giue her soule a deadly counter-buffe, Shee wil (as forc'd) confesse, shee hath no might VVhen Griefe, scarse sensible, but comes in sight. VVe can brooke pleasures want with greater ease, Griefes doe more annoy vs then Pleasures delight vs. Then not feele griefes though they in pleasure bite; For, absent good doth not so much displease, As present ill our Soules soule doth disease. For corporall pleasure being sensuall Consists in some excesse, which stil doth tende To the extreame subversion of our All; The feare whereof must pleasure needs suspend, And make her suffer pennance to the ende. No C?sci?ce Gods c?m?dements m?tioned in the Decalogue. sear'd with Lusts Soul-scortching fire, But feeles the Lawes sharpe-burning Iron to send An hell of paine, where she is most intire; For it doth death it selfe with life inspire. Now as the pleasures of the eie surpasse The rest that on the outward senses rest: So Fancies pleasures all those pleasures passe, Because Opinion esteemes them best; Hence is it, wealth with pleasure is possest For no inherent vertue, but because Opinion holdeth the possessor blest; This makes men (maugre God and Natures lawes) To bite, and scrat for wealth, with Teeth and Pawse. VVealth, state, and glorie, if they worldly be, False wealth, fraile state, vaine-glory then they are; Only held good by doting Fantasie, Which wil no part thereof to Reason share, Least shee should finde them false, and bid beware: But Reasons pleasures are perpetuall, They are all comforte, quitted from all Care, They thrall the Minde to freedome spiritual, That makes selfe Bondage, sweet selfe Freedoms thral. Bodily pleasures are but paines c?pared to those of the minde.No marvell then, though Men possessing these Doe hold al other pleasures hels of paine; That some their wealth haue throwne into the Seas, That so they might this weale with ease retaine; These made that Eccles. 2. King to hold all pleasures vaine (Save these alone) that prov'd all vnder Sunne, These haue made Princes quitt their princely Traine, Train'd by these pleasures (which are never dunne) Quite from their Scepters and themselues to runne. These make the Mind and Sp'rite so Nectar-dr?ck That they sleepe soundly in divine delight: These make the Soule forsake the Bodies Trunck, Leaving it Ioy-tranc'd whilst shee takes her flight Through Natures workes to have her Makers sight: These, these, &amp; none but these are Heau'ns on Earth, Because on Earth they see by Natures light The highest Heavens Maiestie and Mirth, And by his Sonnes light God the Father, fatherless. without Sire, their birth. Among which pleasures, those which doe consist In Contemplation, are the most divine; By which this life and that to come are blist, VVhich made Philosophers to it assigne The Chiefe Beatitude, the Spirittes vvine. If Mindes that never knew the Sov'raigne Good Mount vp so high to make this Good their fine, VVhat shame for those baptiz'd in Christ his blood, If they (like Swine) doe place the same in mudd? And as the Soule retaineth more or lesse Of pristine purity, so will the same In all hir Actions, lesse or more transgresse, And to the best, or worst, her motions frame: Therfore some place their pleasure in their fame For knowledge, and seeke knowledge to be knowne; Some in rare handy-works, and some in Game, Some how a State may stand, or be orethrowne VVhen it is little, or else overgrowne. And of al skils that meerely are humane, Civill Policie.This skill is it that most commends the soule: This can instruct the sword to make a lane To Crownes, &amp; teach the same Crownes to c?troule, And slaues in Catalogue of kings enroule. For Policies long Arme can compasse pow'r, Which ioin'd, at wil, the Earths huge Bowle c? roule In Natures spight, if from th'ætheriall Towre, A suddaine vengeance stay not humane powre. If the swordes edge be set on Policie, It wil slip through the Ioints of Monarchies; And shaue the Crowne of Roiall Maiestie, So be it stand in way of Tyranies, That clime to Crownes by bloud and villanies. The hand of Policie welding the sword, Directs each Blow that wounds stil multiplies, Crownes are purchased often vniustly by bloudy c?quests.That slaues to Crownes through streams of bloud may ford; For Crownes de Or, those sanguine streames afford. Here Muse craue licence for a maine digresse, Of those that shal thine Ambages survay; Sith Policie compels thee to transgresse The Rules of Order, her pow'r to display; She (most importunate) wil haue no nay, But thou must from thy proiect long desist To blazon her high vertue by the way, That sense may see wherein shee doth consist, Wherein (being much) thou must the more insist. But what I shall in this behalfe insert Through my no skill and lesse experiment, Comes from a Muse that can but speake of part, Much lesse hath skill to teach al government; Or if shee had, shee were too insolent So to presume; sith Reason hath bin strain'd To highest reach for Rules of Regiment; Sufficeth me to touch it as constrain'd By that I handle; els, would haue refrain'd. Nor wil I iustifie all rules for right, That Policie approveth for direct; God, and Mans wisedome are repugnant quite; Mans wisedome holdes for good a good effect Caused by ill, which Gods doth stil reiect: And to doe all that Policie doth will Must needes the soule with mortal Sores infect; Heare, what shee wils, then iudge, if well or ill; And vse or els refuse it, as yee will. Whose powre if it with puissance be conioin'd Policy (vnder God) is the overruler of all vnder heav?. Controules al powres, saue hellish or divine; It glues together states, that VVarres vnioin'd, And severs those that Concord did combine: It makes or marres disposing Mine and Thine: On Sov'raignes heads it makes Crownes close to sit, That sooner shal their heads then Crownes decline; It makes VVill law, when VVit thinkes Law vnfit, Yet wils that Law should lincke with VVill and wit. It tels the Statesman sitting at the Sterne, To Princes wee must giue our reasons by waight, &amp; our words by measure. (Embozom'd by his sov'raigne) he must be Carefull the humor of his Lige to learne, And so apply himselfe thereto, that hee May neither crosse nor with it stil agree: Like Sol that with nor gainst the Heaven goes, Similie. But runnes ascue, by whose obliquitie, All Policie ought to tend to publicke profite. Each thing on Earth's conserv'd, and gayly groes; So Councellors their councels shoulde dispose. Simil.And as the Moone reflects her borrowed light Vnto the Sunne, that but lent her the same: So statesmen should reflect (how ere vnright) Their wel-deservings, and their brightest fame Where the worde of the king is, there is power, and who shall say to him, what dost thou?

For Princes may put shame of their oresights Vpon their servants, who must beare the blame, Applying praises of those mens foresights Vnto themselues, as if they were their rights. Great Subiects must beware of subiects loue, And Sov'raignes hate the first oft breeds the last; Kings wil their Brethren hate, if not reproue For being too wel belov'd, who often tast The evil speede that growes from that loues hast; Men shoulde not bee divels to shun t?porall death, or to be Gods on earth.

And, if in case a mighty Multitude Of mighty Men for Treason were to dy, Policie would not haue the sword imbrude In bloud of them as t'were successiuely; But all at once, let them al headlesse ly: For oft Iteration of rev?g for one fault, is faulty.

But that, that shalbe, shalbe.

To spare that heire till more necessitie. When he had cleer'd the coast, and clensd the waie, Of all that lay in either to molest, And having put the state in perfect staie, He with his Fathers laid him downe to rest, And left a Sonne in whom the Land was blest: Edw. 6. VVho being yong, could not yet stirre the sterne, But rul'd by those his sire esteemed best; And while the vertuous King to rule did learne, His Realme (misrul'd) in vp-rore did discerne.

These Men-beastes are as if they never were, Sensuall persons are vselesse, burdens to the earth. They burden but the Earth, yet are too light, VVho liue to lust, yet streight away they weare, (Like Dew against the sunne in highest height) With flesh-consuming fleshly fraile delight. These senslesse spunges of Improbity Are full of pleasure, but it is vnright; For Gods hand squizeth out their iollitie, And fils their Mindes with reall miserie. The Minde, her pleasures needs not intermit The senses soone weery of their pleasures. And then retake them, as the senses must: But changeth them as shee thinkes requisit, (Sometimes the iust, for pleasures most vniust, So changing Loue too oft to lothsome Lust) Except the powre, from whence the motion springs Be hindred by (and so betrai'd in trust) Some let in th'Organs, vsd in her workings, Wine &amp; sicknes 2. Obstacles that lets the mindes actions. Simil. Which VVines excesse, and sicknesse often brings.

That so shee may imploy her wonted force Vpon the pleasures, which her most contents, Be they vaine Ioies, or divine ravishments. It then behoves vs to be wel advis'd What matter we propose vnto our minde; Or good, or ill, or ill with good disguiz'd: For if shee should therein a liking finde, Shee will thereto be evermore inclin'de: Simil.Like some pure virgins, that nere knew the sport That men doe yeeld them, in the kindest kinde, Having once tasted it, are all amort But when (though damn'd) they are at that disport. If then we would cheere this ay-moving mind, We must haue care, that that be perfect good Which shee doth chew (how different e're in kynd) For, corrupt Aliments breede corrupt blood; And blood corrupted is Confusions flood: But sensuall pleasures cannot please the Sense Without being cloied, though they change their mood; Sense must awhile forbear pleasures to make them more pleas?t.For S?se sometimes must hold th? in susp?ce, To sett an edge the while on her dull'd sence. Likewise, the pleasures which we doe receave From The pleasurs which sense receiues from natural things are more pleasant th? those fr? Artificiall. Natures works haue much more force, then those That we from Artificiall things conceaue: For lett all Artes vnto our view expose What Arte it selfe in each kinde can disclose, They bring satiety soone with the sight; But who is cloi'd to see a flowred Close, Hills, Dales, Brooks, Meads, VVoods, Groues, all daintie dight, Sunne, Moone, and Starrs, &amp; al in perfect plight? For we, being naturall, doe best agree With things in nature no lesse naturall; Yet, to confesse a wel-know'n veritee, Our often seeing these faire Creatures all Doth make the pleasure much lesse Nothing vnder the S?ne long c?tents: therefore wee should seeke contentment aboue the Sunne. Cordial, Herehence it is, that we doe lesse admire The pow'r of that Hand supernaturall, Which did this al with al these Faires attire; And so not praise him, as his workes require. Yet if a Child, confin'de t'a Dungeon deepe Vntil he had attained Manhoods yeares, Should on a S?mers-day fr? some high steepe Vpon a suddaine see these glorious Fayres, His Eyes would ravisht be, how ere his Eares; For Eares should solac'd be, aswell as Eyes, With the melodious Birdes. nimble-winged Quiers; Nay I suppose such ioy would him surprise, As he were plung'd in ioyes of Paradize. But while he's Dungeon'd, let the expert'st Tonge (That able were to create Living wordes) Paint out the Earth with quicke-words, great with yonge, And though that Fry againe like Spawne affords, And ev'ry one had pow'r to pierce like Swords Into the nature of these Rarities, To make him compreh?d the highest Lords Inferior'st workes, he could not well c?prize The thous?dth part of grace which in th? lies.

But herein's faulty this Comparison: To Mundane things is fixt satiety, But those blest Things that are aboue the Sun Are priviledg'd from such deficiency; For they are ful of all The propertie of true felicity is alwaies to c?cent the desire and exclude feare. felicity: The more they are beheld the more they may, For they content Desires best-sighted Eye, And please the more, because that still they stay; “For true ioyes are compleate by their delay. Aske that same third-Heau'n-rapt St. Paule. Saint, what hee saw Or what he heard, when he was ravisht so; Hee'l tell you (though most learn'd in sacred Law And no lesse learn'd each way) he doth not kno, The ioye thereof his Sense did so oreflo. If then so great a Clark, so pure a Saint, Being but in the Heau'n, two lofts belo, Wants words the ioye thereof aright to paint, Who can the highest Heavens blisse depaint? Thus the Affects of ioy and Griefe, are giv'n By him, that giues all onely to one end, To weet, his Glorie, and desire of Heau'n; Ioye to alure, and Griefe th'Affects to bend From that which doth to Griefe and Horror tend. Now then, to runne through other strong Affects, And to descend to Love, (that doth Loue doth descend not ascend. descend) Which is a Passion powrefull in effects And chiefely the chief good by kinde respects. When Iudgment hath alow'd a thing for good, Shee foorth-with tenders it vnto the VVill, Which doth embrace the same in ioyful moode, Because it doth hir Soules desire fulfill: And when that ioy (conceav'd) doth tarry still Its called Loue, which doth the wil incline How love is bredd. To simple good, or good scarce toucht with ill: Thus Loue is bredd or humane or divine, Which in the soule like a faire Flame doth shine. But Loue, that hath respect to any thing Besides the goodnes of the thing belov'd, Is rather doating, which doth loathing bring Doating brings loathing. Wh? things therby desir'd are wel approv'd: If God himselfe bee for his bounty lov'd And onely therefore, who doth loue him so Doth loue him for his goodnes, by him prov'd, Yea for that goodnes which to him doth flo, Not for that good which he cannot forego. Who loveth vs for his owne goodnesse sake, And for no good in vs, (for we have none) We should loue him, not for he did vs God should simply be loved for his own goodnes. make, But for his goodnesse onely and alone, And loue al goodnesse, for, and in that One: A father loues his sonne, not in regard Of any gaine, but for he is his owne; Nor should a Sonne, his Sire loue for reward, But for he is his Sire in Nature dear'd. For, if we loue ought for the good we have From it, we loue our selves more then the same, Or loue it for our selves, our selues to save From want of that which from it to vs came: So such loue is selfe-loue, which Love doth blame: It is selfe-loue to love God for his bounty towards vs onely. But we must loue the Lord of Love for love; Nay, though he hate vs, we must love his name, Sith to make man Loue made vs to loue. Loue onely did him move But to loue him againe for Mannes behove. If then we weigh, by vvhat degrees wee mount To him from vvhom our soules did first descend, We finde that as through loue (which doth surmo?t) They came from him, so to him they ascende God is mans beginning &amp; his end.The selfe-same way, as to their proper end. For comming from him, they must know him needs; And knowing him, they needes must to him tend, But so they cannot, but by loues good-deedes; For what is not of loue, from sinne proceedes. The order of loues progresThe order then, of the degrees to loue Is, first vvee at things corporall beginne; For, our birth to that Steppe vs streight doth moue; Vnto our outward senses then wee rinne, To Fancie next, and so wee never linne Till through Reas'n, Iudgement, Contemplation, VVe come to loue, and so wee rest therein: But to descend by the selfe same gradation, And there to rest, descendeth to damnation. For, to dismount from true loues loftie pitch (Loue of the High'st,) so lowe as to self-loue, Is, Sow-like, to lie mired in the ditch Of lowest Hell, where we all Sorowes proue, And cannot for our soules from thence remoue Without kinde heav'nly loues all-helping hand; He workes in vs both the will and the deede.Which onely and alone hath powre to moue Our Mindes from Earth vnto the Livings Land, And breake the linckes of selfe-loues mortall Band. Loue makes an Vnion of Diversitie; If then wee loue God, hee and wee are One, One (although diverse) through true amitie; VVee loue him and our selues for him alone: So may we loue our selues, as wee loue none. Selfe-loue is iustifiable wh? we loue our selues for god only. Likenesse breedes loue, which makes him loue vs so Who made vs to his Image; and his Sonne Assum'd our shape, which makes his loue the mo: Then, by like reason, wee should loue him to. The more his Image is renew'd in vs, The more he loues vs, and wee loue the more; Then to deforme the same's most odious, And he detesteth vs alone therefore, VVhich makes vs likewise loath him and his lore: All which proceedes from dissimilitude, For, God and Beliall are foes evermore; Then sith wee are with his faire Forme indu'd, Let it by vs bee euermore renew'd. For, Beauty is an vrgent cause of Loue; Beauty is a speciall cause of loue. If so, wee should embrace the fairest Faire With loue that should be farre all loue aboue, Yea, die for loue, that Loue might life repaire, And glorifie the same as Beauties Heire: See wee an hue that mortall beauty staines (As doth the Sunne the Moone by his repaire) This sov'raigne Beauty all the glorie gaines, God the Fo?t of all Beauty. Sith but a sparke thereof the same sustaines. Then Beauty blush to glorie in thy Blaze, And much more blush to blaze thy glorie vaine With coulors fresh, to make fraile eies to gaze, Painting the face. And such as cannot iudge of coulors, faine; No coulor hast thou so thy selfe to staine: The best is too too bad, and bad's the Best, That without Without coulor of Reason. coulor doe their face ingraine: In earnest such (I thinke) doe loue to Iest, As Chaucer, but my, Muse will owe the rest. But out ward beauty loue procures, because Outward argues inwarde beauty.It argues th'inward beauty of the Minde; For goodnes is th'effect, Beauty the Cause, And both togither commonly we finde; For Nature both togither stil doth binde. A good Complexions disposition Is, for the most part, vertuously inclinde; But VVeomens beauty by permission Being often tempted breedes suspition. Sinne is conceived in the wombe of concupiscence.For hardly is that kept, that many craues, And chastitie with beautie's stil at strife; For, much more beautiful are Frailties slaues Th? (for the most part) they of vertuous life: And, aske a man, that hath a beautious wife, How much he fears the fowle fal of his faire, Because that nothing in the world's more rife Then at faire beauties byding mens repaire; And where they ha?t, they do not stil They rather ruine then repaire the tender honors of women. repaire. But this by accident is rather thus, Then any waie to beauty naturall; For it, by Nature, is most vertuous, A well t?pred body makes a like tempered mind ordinarily.Sith Tempers good, to Ill are seldome thrall: For, bodies meerely are Organicall, Wheron the mind doth play al parts in one, If then they be in tune, most cordiall Their moti?s must be needs, sith there is none That moues th? but the minde or God alone. But for that beauty stil alures the eie, An vnchaste eie loues to looke vpon a light eie.The eie the hart, the hart the soule &amp; Sp'rite Of those, that on the same do chance to pry, Because it doth beheau'n them with delight: This makes them instantly the same incite To yeeld to loue, or lust, and their desire; Then being subiect thus to restlesse fight. It oft enflames, and is enflam'd with fire, That Flesh and Sprite makes but one flame intire. How many may wee see distracted quight, Or pyning liue, or rather dy with paine? Yea some to spill themselues (with all despight) For others beautie which they cannot gaine? Beauty figniorizeth the sense. The beauty of a Wom? cheereth the face, and a man loues nothing better. Eccl. 36. 22. If beauty then so ore fraile sense doth raigne, Sense, being subiect to her sov'raigntie Doth sue and serue, her favour to obtaine, VVith most impetuous importunitie, Till shee as subiect, to her Subiect lie. And never times (except the times of old For whose corruption al the world was drown'd) But these curst times of ours, durst be so bold, To make it common with estates renown'd To court bright beauty Maried. match'd, as t'were unbound: Call yee it Courtshippe? cal it what yee please (Though it be in request) it was not found In chaster times; for oft it doth disease The head with swellings which nought can appease. Mee thinkes I see, (as I haue often seene) A well-made Male, as male-content to stand (In silke or silver clad right well-beseene) VVringing a match'd faire Female by the hand, Adultery Luxury, wantonnesse, slouth, Pride, &amp;c. are sins in Specie, the Genus to all these is Caro. VVhil'st, in her eare, he lets her vnderstand How much shee ought to loue him for his loue; Meane while hard by stands Patience the Husband, And lets Temptation his weake vessell proue, VVhich in his sight her vnseene Spright doth moue. Its prettie pastime so to passe the time, It savoures of good breeding, and good VVitt: The Howres are made more pleasant by this Chime, Who would not stil to here the same stil sitt, Although a man transformed were by it? O tis a iolly matter to give eare, Nay to give leaue to Musicke in her fitt: He is a Beast that wil not then forbeare Though he thereby be made a Beast to beare. 4. Kindes of divine furie.Foure kinds of divine fury are obseru'd, 1. The first (and first by right) Propheticall, Which by Apollo is rul'd, and conserv'd; 2.The next by Bacchus, called Misticall; 3.The third by Muses, hight Poeticall; 4.The fourth and last, by Venus governed, Is call'd the Fury Amatoriall; Which doe inferre, that Love is borne and bredd Without the breach of Natures Maidenhedd. What force it hath, is better felt then showne, Loues force is vnvtterable.For VVords cannot expresse the force of loue; Call we it Love or Lust, it is well known It hath the force of both, the Heart to move; Which these can testifie that it did prove: Semiramis (whose Vertue past compare) This furious Passion her did so remoue From that shee was; that lusting to reshare Hir Sonne, her Sonne her Threed of Life did share. The Macedonian Philipps peerelesse Alexander Mag. Sonne, That over-ranne the VVorld with Sword and Fire, This flaming fury yet did so ore runne, That for his Thais (that kindled his desire) He burnt Plutar. in Alexand. Persepolis, sans cause of ire: Yea, did not onely that fowle fact command, But with his Hands he lab'red (as for hire) To burne the buildings which as yet did stand, Till he had laid al level with the Land. A VVonder worthy of all wonderment, That he that foil'd what ere his force withstood, Should bee thus foil'd, and made a President Of Lusts fell force, which so enflam'd his Blood That made his Flesh Wild-Fire in likelyhood: A Man by woman, a King by a Queane To be so overcome through Lustfull moode, (Being so effeminate and most obscene) Argues, in Loue and Lust there is no meane. Loue is lawles Strange are th'effects of Lust. For, Men with Men Nay, Man with Beast: A Sinne not to be toucht So much as with the Tongue, much lesse with Pen, And least of all with that too oft bewitcht, With loue of that which is by Nature grutcht: Lust is so blinde that it cannot discerne A Man from Beast, (how ever beastly coucht) But doth a Man-beast moue (though Nature yerne) The tricks of Beasts, with lothsome Beasts to learne. Graue Xenephon lov'd Clinias in this kinde; So as hee crav'd of Ioue when Clinias di'de, That (if he might see him, and still be blinde, Or not see him, and still be perfect Eyde) He rather mought the want of sight abide To see him once, then still to haue his sight And not see him; See see how blinde a Guide Is lothsome Lust, that leades men so vnright, Lust is blinde. As for her pleasure so themselues to spight. Semiramis an Horse (ô brutish Lust!) Did lust to haue (ô m?strous Mare humane!) Pasiphaë long'd for a Bull to thrust Her from a woman to a Cow vncleane: And Cyparissus made an Hynde the meane To coole his courage; Aristomachus A silly Bee would haue to be his Queane. Lust whither wilt? wilt be so monstrous To long for Bees that be but moates to vs? Publius Pilatus fell in lusting loue With Hellens Image; and Pigmalion Such lovers are as sensles as the stones which they loue.For his owne Picture did like passion prove. Damn'd Lust what pleasure provd'st thou in a stone That's cold by kind, as Snow on Libanon? To tell the Mischiefes, Spoiles, &amp; Masacres, By hate effected, though through loue begun, Were but to tell the number of the Starrs; For Lust and Mischeife are ioynt-passengers. Troy might (perhappes) haue stoode vnto this Age, Had Lust not laid it levell with the plaines; And seas of Blood spent in that ten yeares Siege Might still haue kept the Chanells of the Vaynes: Lust is most willfull.But lewde Lust is so loose that shee restraines Her will in nought, though it bringes all to nought: Shee pleasure takes in pleasure causing paines; For by her painfull pleasures such are wrought, Yet on such pleasures shee doth fixe her thought. Shee will not let the Thoughts so much as prie A minutes space, on ought, but what shee loues; Shee (Tirant) captivates the Fantasy, So that it cannot stirre till shee it moves: Or if it doe shee forth-with it removes. My Fancies Mistris, saith some slaue to Lust, Is my Thoughts Heau'n: So swallowed with his Loues Are all his Thoughts; and though as dry as Dust He lusts to please his loue with loue vniust. For this, al that pertaines, must be in print, VVeeds, VVords, Lookes, Loks, in print, not one awry, Whose Motions must be currant for the Mynt; His glances must keepe iust time with her Eye, O toile intollerable! And seeme to die, se'ng her rich beauties dye: Yet with a carefull carelessenesse, he must Avoide the hate which too much loue doth buy, And loue no more then may provoke to lust; These are their loue-tricks, trickes of loue vniust. One makes an Idoll of his Mistris Glove, And offers (thrice a day at least) a Kisse Vnto each finger, so to show his loue; Another her Haire-Bracelett makes his blisse, And Night and Day t'adore it wil not misse. These Fancies, fancie doe with kindnes cloy, VVitt nere, in loue, taught Pupill so of his, (As saith the Book) but doth his powres imploy With kindnesse coy, to winne his witty Toy. Whist Muse, be mute; wilt thou like Naso proue, Quoth Speculation. And interlace thy Lynes with levity? Wilt thou add Precepts to the Arte of Loue, And show thy vertue in such vanity? So to polute thy purer Poesy! No more, no more, ynough, (if not too much) Is sedd already of this Mistery; My Conscience at the same doth (grieving) grutch, But let it goe this once, with but this Touch. Beauty promiseth more honesty then deformity.And how-soere Beauty may bee abus'd, It promiseth more good then shapelesnesse: If it proue otherwise, its thus excus'd; The High'st to shew that good-guifts (more or lesse) Proceede from him, and not from Natures largesse, Lets beauty fal, and soile it selfe with sinne, VVhich is more dam'd if beauty it doth blesse, As Vertue is most faire, that blest hath bin VVith beauty being resident therein. But loue, that Beautie breedeth, is threefold, According to three obiects of that loue, All faire, some good, which thus we may vnfold; 3. Causes of loue viz Pleasant, profitable, &amp; honest.The Pleasant, and the Profitable mooue As doth the Honest, true loue, which vve proue: The first concerneth things that please the Sense, 1As beautie, and at what the sense doth roue; 2The second hath to welfare reference; 3The third and last to Iustice and Prudence. The first and second kinds of lust or loue, Among the Perturbations may be put, Sith they so many ill affections moue That make mans life to be in Sorrow shut, VVhich like a Razor off the same doth cut: But loue of honest things is vertuous, And from mans praises takes away the But; It shows the Minde is right magnanimous; ‘For that's most great, that is most gracious. Perfect loue.This loue is kindled by that heav'nly Flame That like fine Gold, doth purifie the Sp'rite; And like it selfe (transmuted) maks the same Good, gratious, holy, wise, iust, clear, &amp; bright, Glory'ng in him that makes her glory right: God, the Exchequer of Beauty. This is the loue of beauty most extreame VVherein celestial soules doe most delight; Of loue that feedes the Sp'rite it is the creame Infus'd by Iustice Sonnes inlightning Beame. This loue resembles that of Seraphins, VVho burne in loue of the extremest Good; And makes Men like the sacred Cherubins Still priviledg'd from outward charge; whose moode Is stil t'attend on LOVES Trin-vnion-hood. This loue, this beauty, (Loue of vertuous things Whose beauty flowes from divine beauties Flud) Doth make Men Gods among the mighti'st Kings, And Kings with highest God, in high'st dwellings. Goodnesse is Beauties Mother, and true Loues; Goodnesse is mother to loue &amp; beauty Beauty and loue are both bred in one VVombe: Then loue and beautie stil it much behoues To tend to Goodnesse, as vnto the Tombe That must at last for ever them enwombe. But there are diverse loues, and beauties mo, According to the creatures all or some Proceeding from that LOVE and BEAVTY, who Sheds both on things aboue, and things belo. Fowre special beauties, Goodnesse hath created; Goodneshath made 4 especiall beauties. The first is that, whereby the Minde and sp'rite Hath VVit and Vnderstanding in them seated: 1 The second, them adornes with Knowledge bright 2 That mounts the Minde to Contemplations height; The third, in seede preserving mortall things; 3 The last in corp'rall things that sense delight: 4 Science the Soule to Contemplation brings, But her to things materiall Fancie flings. Yet, did the soule but weigh hovv shee is bound To her Creator, for his matchlesse loue; Shee would from thence (by Reason) soone rebound, The little consideration we haue of Gods goodnesse towards vs, is the cause of our coldnesse in loue to himAnd wholy stil contemplate things aboue: For this, his loue requitlesse doth approue; He gaue her beeing, meerely of free grace Before shee VVas, or could his mercie moue; Then if shee loue him, her loue is but base Compar'd with his that made her what shee was. VVho giues a Guift much more affection shoes Then the Receaver for it can bewray; The giver giues, beeing free to giue or choose, But the Receaver's bound to loue alway: Yet, if the giver giues to th'end to pray, Its not of Loue, but Lucre, (loth'd of Loue;) GOD cannot giue so, in whom all doth stay: But Men giue thanks for Blessings which they proue, And God thereby to giue them more doe moue. The loue that is bought is stark nought.Such loue in giver and receiver both Is meerely merc'nary corrupt, and base, VVhich hatefull loue the Lord of loue doth loth, And from such lovers turnes his loving face, As from false Hypocrites, abusing grace: But true loves scope, is (in a gracious moode) To loue all those that Mercie shoulde embrace, Respecting nought, but to streame foorth the flud Of goodnesse, which it hath for others good. For loue is free, and freely would be lov'd; Its actiue, like a Flame in operation; Saue that, like fire it is not vpwardes mou'd, But doth descende by Reasons computation, For such descent on Reason hath foundation: The Sire doth loue the Sonne, more then the Sonne Doth loue the Sire, because by generation Part of the Sire into the Sonne doth runne, A natural reason why loue descendeth. But no part of the Sonne in Sire doth wonne. Sith loue in nature stil doth thus descende, God loues man more then Man his God can loue; For Man proceedes from God who is his ende; But God from Man likewise cannot remoue, In him we liue move, &amp; haue our being. For Man is finite, and in God doth moue: This made him loue Men when they were his foes, And for their loues a world of woe did proue: Therefore hee's Fount of Loue whence all loue floes Which loues for hate, and hate doth loue-dispose. Now, how to loue this VVell of loue the more Loue doth direct, by kindling the Desire Truely to know and minde it evermore; To know gods loue is the way to make Man loue. Both which so sets the soules frame all on fire, That it is made one flame of loue intire: The more wee know it, it the more wee minde; The more wee minde it, it wee more require; The more we seeke, the more wee it doe finde, And being found, it quite doth lose the Minde. For then the Mindes no more that which it was, For to this loue it's transubstantiate, To weete as neere as loue can bring to passe Its ev'n the selfe-same thing immaculate, And like this LOVE, this loue doth contemplate; Reiecting all that would inveagle it To loue ought els, and stil doth meditate To loue nought els, and bends all powres of wit To make it selfe for this Loue onely fit. Thus Sinners may turne Seraphins by All true loue is either Amor Cœlior amor Seculi, this of our neighboure, that, of God. As there is no loue without faith, so there is no faith without loue. Loue, wounding with Loue-shafts Gods hart (pure alone;) So, as the ones hart so the others moue As twixt them al there were no Hart but one: This is to lye next the chiefe Corner-stone In the Church-militant, (Triumphant rather,) For God and man this Loue doth to attone As doth, nay more then loue doth Sonne and Father; For loue makes both intire still altogether. Loue, of all humane Affections is, the most puisant &amp; passionate.For Loue doth graue (though in an Hart of Brasse) The forme of the Beloued in the Hart, So that a Lovers Hart is like a Glasse Where the Belou'd is seene in ev'ry part; So, in Gods Hart w'are graven by Loves Arte, And in our harts Loue doth his forme ingrave; Thus interchang'd we eithers forme impart To others liking by the Loue is the Bond that vnites God &amp; man. Loue we have, And make the Hart the Lodge it to receave. The ende or scope of loue is to vnite; The faster therefore it conglutinates Two harts, or of them makes an vnion right, So much the more her vertue shee elates, And perfectly her kinde effectuates: Then, Loue in God (in whom Love perfect is) His vertue so to man participates, That they become Brothers by redemption ought to be more neere &amp; deere to each other, th? Brothers by creation. one through that loue of his; For Man partakes his Image and his Blisse. But man (meere Chaos of extreame Defect) Doth loue, but loveth onely in desire: He longs (perhapps) to loue with al effect, That God and he thereby might be intire, Whereto his leaden loue would faine aspire; From which desire proceeds a pleasant paine, Pleasant, in that it setts the soule on fire With loue so good; And paine it breeds again, In good desires there is pleasure and paine. For that it hath not, what it would haue fain. But what is lacking in Mans loue, the same God doth supply out of his boundlesse loue; And makes M?s loue therby a working flame, Which to presse through al Pressures stil doth prove, And towards God (her Spheare) doth ever move: This Flame doth melt the marrow of the Sp'rite Making it liquid sooner to remove In't Mercies Mould, where its reform'd aright, And made intire with God. LOVE, true loues delight. For when the lover loues himselfe no more, But the Beloved in whom he abides, Or, if he loue himselfe, it is therefore To weet, for that he in his loue resides; Then Loue is pure, &amp; at high'st pitch besides. When loue is in the height of perfection. But such high Raptures are too rarely found, In fraile humanity, that on Earth bides; Though loue the Soule therfore perhaps may wound Yet stil t'wil be to the owne Body bound. How shal I end with everlasting Loue, To ease my Reader tir'd with heavy lines? Vnto this Labarinth of Loue (I prove) The Author (LOVE) no comming out assignes; Yet rest I may, though it my Muse confines: As Zeuxis drue a vaile (with curious skill) Ore that, hee wanted skill t'expresse by Lines; So I the like in Loue must now fulfill, And leave the Reader to thinke what he will. Now may we range next to the Ranke of loue Other Affections, and to doe it right We must place Favoure there, by which w'approve Of some thing wherein we conceave delight, For that it's good in deede or so in sight: Herein Loues obligation doth commence; Yet favoure may haue force where loue lacks might, But without Favoure, Loue is a non ENS; For, Favoure waites vpon Loves excellence. Howe favoure is bredd.Then Reverence with Favour we may Ranke, Bredd by comparing some high Dignitie With some inferior State (that Fortune sanck) Which then is in it's right especially, When extreame feare and Hatred come not ny: For though in Rev'rence, Feare and Shamefastnesse, VVith moderation doe obscurely lye; Yet Feare (by some Ill caus'd) Good doth suppresse, Still seene in that which breedes our humblenesse. True rev'rence therefore beare we vnto God Who is all good, as he almightie is; For, fear'd we nought but his revenging Rodd, Our Rev'rence, would be turn'd to hate by this: Reverence springs from powre and goodnesse.Then Rev'rence growes from pow'r and grace of his; And, whosoere with them he most endowes, Of Rev'rence from lesse Rev'rend cannot misse: For Rev'rence Pow'r and Goodnesse still ensues, And the lesse worthie to the better bowes. For when we eie the vertue, pow'r, and grace, Of the most Noble, (truely called so) And looke vpon our selves, and weigh how base VVe are compar'd with them, then bend we lo As vnto them that vs in Good out-go. For, as selfe-liking doth enlarge the Hart, Simil. Or puffe it vp (like Bladders which we blo) So it contracts it selfe in ev'ry part, When we see others passe vs in desart. Then as we rev'rence God for goodnesse more, We reverence God more for his goodnesse then for his powre. Then for his might, and awfull Maiesty; So, if we would be rev'renc't of the Low'r, We must surmount them in that ex'lency That makes vs most resemble Dëity: For whereas Goodnesse doth associate Might, There the most Insolent, most rev'rently (Though otherwise repleat with al Dispight) VVill doe their Homage freely with delight. For homage, fealty, and honor, are To sacred Vertue due by Natures Law: Honor we owe to Vertue (though but bare) And Vertue matcht with might doth Rev'rence draw. Then Honor, Reverence, and loving awe To whom honor and reverence are due vpon Earth Are due to Maiestie; and that is due To Magistrats that Men fr? Vice with-draw, And make them Vertue eagerly ensue, Themselues therin be'ng Leaders of the Crue. The last Affects to Love subordinate Are Mercy and Compassion; These are they Mercy and compassion, Affectes flowing from loue VVhich make vs (like God) to commiserate The miseries of those that still decay, Or are at point to perish without stay. These, these, bewraie that we are Members quick Of that same Bodie, whose Head doth bewray That they are Members mortifide, or sick VVhich feele no paines, that fellow-members prick. These make vs make the hand of the distrest Our Mucke and Earthly Mammons continent, Yea make vs make the Orphanes home our Brest, And our right Arme the VVeedowes Sustinent; Loue hath nothing in private.And all that want, our All them to content. O that these were more frequent then they are With those that doe our Churches so frequent! For damn'ds Devotion that will nothing spare, But for selfe-comfort altogither care. These, Colledges and Hospitals erect, And both endow with copious maintenance; These are so prevalent in their effect, That they vnto the Heav'ns doe Man made of earth. Earth advance, Wherein there is no want or sufferance: These doe forgiue, as gladly as they giue, Vnto their foes miscarried by Mischance; These good and bad (like God) in lacke relieue, “For Mercies Bowels melt when anie grieue. These Bridges builde ore Rivers (semi-Seas) And turne deepe VVaies (though endlesse in extent) To Cawseis firme, for Man and Beasts more ease, Compassi? extendeth her vertue to man and beast.And ev'ry waie provide for bothes content, Through fellow-feeling of their dryriment: These make their VVaredrops and the Needies, one, And their owne Limbes, limbes of the impotent; Ioy with the ioiefull, mone with them that mone And sigh in soule, when they in Bodie grone. O that my soule could (as it gladly would) It selfe infuse into each worde or line That tendes to Mercies glorie, then it should (So as it ought) at least like Phœbus shine, If not at most, bee more then most divine: Mercy &amp; Iustice are gods almightie Armes. For, Mercie and Iustice are Gods mightie Armes, But he most might to Mercie doth assigne As bee'ng the right Arme, holding all from harmes Though All do fall through Frailties least Alarmes. Mercie's the true Idea of Gods Soule, Wherein his matchlesse glorie glitters most; Which is of force his Iustice to controule: For when in Iustice all that are, were lost, Then Mercie them redeem'd, to Iustice cost; The Lord of Iustice was vniustly slaine, That Mercie might triumph, and iustly boast: Gods Mercie triumpheth over his Iustice towards Man. As Loue first made, so Mercie made againe Man-kind, that sin had marr'd with monstrous stain. Sith Mercie then is of so high account, Shee should bee most familier with the Hy: Princes and Maiestrates. For, God in mercy doth himselfe surmount, That is, it doth himselfe most glorify: So they that eie the Poore with Pitties eie, And haue most mercie seated in their soule, Draw neer'st the nature of his Dëity; Whose names engrossed are in his Check-role. And next him ought the VNIVERS to rule. Thus having toucht th' Affections most humane That humane nature doe consociate; Now follow those that are most inhumane, Inhumane affections howe bred. Bred by Opinion of Ill, which wee hate Which make vs savage or in worse estate: The vnrest of our soules, the while they rest Within our Bodies, and predominate, Proceedes from fowre chiefe causes of vnrest, Which thus by Natures searchers are exprest. Perturbations fr? wh? do flow al immoderate passions of the soule. Desire, Feare, Griefe, Ioy, all immoderate (Which perturbations be) from these proceede Al Passions which the soule excruciate, Which the Mindes ignorance doth (fatting) feede; As knowing not what's good or Ill indeede. Desire and Ioie those goods accompany Which be not good, further then Natures neede, And that a little (God wot) doth supply For, overmuch doth her soone mortifie. Aske peace and plenty what fell fights they haue With these three Monsters, Pride, Strife, &amp; Excesse, Hardly themselues, if they at all, doe saue, From their fell force, they eas'ly wil confesse. Wherefore God doth blesse man with abundance.Yet, God with Peace and Plentie, Man doth blesse, That Man might blesse God both in word and deede, Not take occasion from thence to transgresse: But from these Fountaines pure doe oft proceede (By their abuse) Abuses which exceede. There is no greater temptation th? never to be t?pted, &amp; no sorer punishm?t then of God never to bee punished.For, sinne in peace and plentie, is so arm'd VVith all that may allure the simple sense, That sense by those allurements is so charm'd, That soone it yeeldes to sinne obedience, As it were forc'd by some Omnipotence: When sinne so sweetly doth intreate and pray, And promise Flesh, Heav'n in Incontinence, (To which prosperity doth Flesh betray) How can fraile Flesh and Bloud say sweet sinne nay? If Tast would tast, what might her Pallate please, Sinne offers the senses their severall satisfactions. Sinne offers Manna, Nectar, and what not? VVould touching feele? sinne opens pleasures Seas To plunge the sense therein, it to besot. The smell shee ioies with sents as sweete, as hot. The eare shee tickles with such wordes and Notes, That Hearing (ravisht) hath her selfe forgot. With eie bewitching Faires the eie shee dotes: And thus each sense in pleasures seas shee flotes. These senses thus bewitch'd, Fancie allures To share the sweetnesse which they say they finde: Fancie consents; and Iudgement soone procures T'approue their pleasure, which betraies the Minde, (Betrai'd and quite misled by Iudgement blind) Thus in prosperitie sinne domineers, Vertue without adversitie withereth and loseth her forte. VVho vvith strong cordes of Vanity doth biude The soule and body, as it vvel appeeres By those whom welfare to the world endeeres. O Flesh! didst thou but know how suger-svveete The pleasures vvere proceeding from the Crosse; There is no other passage to heaven th? through the fire of Afflictions. Th'wouldst runne amaine, the c?ming crosse to meet And count al gaine, saue that alone, but losse: All sensual Ioies doe thee but turne and tosse With restlesse proofes of false felicitie, Which Ioies retaile, but vtter griefes in grosse, For, corp'rall pleasure in extremitie The center is, of endlesse miserie. Now Griefe and Feare, though they accompany Griefe &amp; fear accompanie transitory riches. These evil goods (goods evil by abuse) Yet they respect all kinde of misery VVhich we conceiue, vvhen wee haue not their vse: Through vvant vvhereof, as through an open sluce Flow all vexations, and annoies of minde, Into the emptie soule, which they reduce To their obedience in rebellious kinde; For Reason they in rage doe rudely binde. The Body hereby (puling') pines away Simil.(Like to a Bladder whose winde is out strain'd) By such degrees, as it doth by the way A whyning make as if the same were pain'd: So, fares the Body, by the Minde constrain'd, Till she be breathles, she breathes out but mone, For want of Goodes but fain'd, her griefes vnfain'd Doe drie vp quite the Marrow of the Bone, As if shee were in wretched plight alone. Good Affects proceede fr? the opinion of good, and evill, fr? evill.For as al good Affections doe proceede From the opinion which we haue of Good; So doth th'opinion of evill breede All ill Affections and each evil moode; For ill Conceipt, conceaues this cursed Broode. Off?ce, what.Now the first touch of ill, is call'd Offence, Fr? whence (if it contynewe) foorth do budd Griefe, Envy, Hate, and fell Impatience, As Loue proceeds from true Goods residence. And sith ther's nought that doth to Earth belonge In which both Good and Ill in deede, or sho Are not (like Phisick-Potions) mixte amonge; All mundane things are as they are tak?.Therfore fr? thence may be drawne VVeale or VVoe As they are tane, sith both from thence doe flo: For that which likes some, some doth most displease; According to the humors which they owe, Some take repose, in that which most disease, As some delight in VVarre, but most in Peace. And the more inly that offences touch, So much the more they doe thereby offend: The inward'st is the better part by much; Then that which thereto doth annoyance send, To the tormenting of the VVhole doth tend: Offenses against the outward Senses are much lesse offensiue then those against the inward. Offences done to the externall Sense Are not so grievous, as those which doe wend To the internall; Nor is VVitts offence So sore, as that which doth the VVill incense. Nay, if our VVill be not offended, we Can suffer, what not? without al offence; In which respect we willingly agree, That Fri?ds reproofs should proue our patience, When with our Foes we would not so dispence: Likewise our selues of our selves so may speake, That others speaking so would vs incense, And make vs mortally revenge to seek: Thus VVill bee'ng pleas'd nought can our Nothing moues our patience that moves not our will. patience breake. Then sith Offence most grieves the tender'st Sense, Therefore are they offended soon'st of all, Whose Mindes and Bodies haue most excellence, And are most delicate and speciall, Bee it by accident, or naturall: And mong the Hoast of Natures Creatures, Man Is hard'st to please, and most to Anger thrall; For he with nought will beare, nor suffer can, Man of all creatures hardest to please. Yet al haue cause this wayward VVaspe to ban. If therefore One it be so hard to please, How much more hard to please an Hoast of Men? What can be saide or done so wel, but these Will Who so pleaseth all doth more then he that made all. all, or some of all, speake there agen? They care not against whom, nor where, nor when. Aske Generalls if this be true or no, Who though they make their Purs-strings cracke agen To please the Presse, yet they shal not doe so, But some will murmur, and speake broadly to. Some, to bee thought more iudicious are most censorious.For, some are so invred fault to finde, That they offended are without offence, Nothing they heare or see, but irkes their minde, So all offendes them without difference: And, to be thought of tall intelligence Their Tongues dispraise, what their Thoughts highly praise; Because they weene great praise proceeds fr? th?ce: For he (thinke they) that sees what to dispraise, Sees and knowes how t'amend it many waies. Criticks of these times.How many may we heare and see of these, Who with bent-brow, scue-looke, and mouth awry Sleightly survaie the workes that wise-men please Protesting them to be but poore; And whie? Because they proue their VVitts base povertie: They faine would faine to haue vnfained skill In ev'rything wherein they faults espie, A Foole may make the wise ridiculous to Fooles.And by depraving VVitt t'haue witt at will, When all's but fain'd, and strain'd and passing ill. When Men adore their owne sufficiencie, And weene their excellence doth check the Skies, What marvel ist, if al beneath the Skie They check; and through their selfe-conceite dispise? (Who, but to see their owne woorth, haue no Eyes) These be men of partes that would have al whollie.These Men are inly mov'd with much offence, When they another see by Vertue rise, Because high State (they weene) should rec?pence No others, but their only excellence. Bee they most poore, yet be they much more proude, Exclaiming on the tymes wherein they live: The c?plaint of base male-contents.For Men of woorth (say they) with parts indow'd The tymes doe not respect, nor wil relive, But wholly Without good partes. vnto partlesse Spirits giue: Thus doe they melt awaie in Envies fire; And whilst hart-burnings th? of rest deprive, They them bestirre to part that is intire, And Comm?-wealthes orethrow, so to aspire. These vnwise wittie Mal-contents are they Divells incarnate tempt m? desperate. That egge on Men vnwise, and violent, T'attempt the over-sway of Princes Sway, Or rather to confound their government, That so they might be made preheminent: For, sly Vlysses must point out the place Gainst which the force of Aiax must be bent, And Men made desp'rate hold it no disgrace To be directed in a desp'rate case. These waspish over-weening idle Drones, Are mortal The Pestil?ce which infects al that comes neere it. plagues to ev'ry Publike-weale: Right anti-Kesars vndermyning Thrones; Yet Princes hardly shal their motions feele Vntil their States and Seates begin to reele: And then too late (perhapps) seeke fast to sitt VVh? they must rest vp? the pointed Steele; These are th'effects of mal-contented VVitt, Which not lookt to, wil haue a madding sitt. All which proceedeth meerely of Offence, C?ceav'd by hateful natures hard to please; VVhich, mischiefe and great inconvenience Bring to a State, and neither Land nor Seas Can possibly be priviledg'd from They walke like Devills invisible. these. VVho still doe feare, their mis-imploied time VVill bring vp? th? that which wil displease; VVhich to prevent they seeke aloft to clime, VVhich to effect, make c?sci?ce of no crime: For, feare of evill (though of ill to come) Doth grieue the minde, as if it present vvere; Cold feare and griefe then Reason so benumme, That it feeles nothing but cold griefe and feare. A natural reason of rebels civill fury.This colde made hot by Ire, which it doth steere Becomes hell fire, which like a quenchlesse flame Consumeth all it toucheth or comes neere, And leaues nought els behinde but lasting blame, So, Feare turn'd Fury, Man doth all vnframe. Simil.For, as in nature, things that are most cold Made hot, are most extreame hot, like the Fire: So Feare, most cold by kind, yet if it should Bee chas'd vncessantly with Hate and Ire, T'would be more hot, then all fires made intire. For, Man is more out-ragious, wilde, and wood In Passions heate, then Passion can desire; A man in fury more furious then a beast.No Beast is halfe so fell, in maddest moode, As Man, when Furie sets on fire his bloud. A discription of an angry Man.From which fire flie out Sparkles through his eies, VVho stare, as if they would their holdes inlarge, The Cheekes vvith boiling Choler burning rise, The mouth doth thundring (Canon-like) discharge The fire which doth the Stomacke overcharge: The teeth doe (grating) one another grind; The fists are fast, in motion to giue charge, The Limbes doe tremble, feete no footing find But stampe, or stand vnconstant as the VVinde. All anger springs from offence but al offence grow not to Anger.Which hellish Passion from Offence proceedes, But all offence proceedes not to the same; Offence the Mother is that Anger breedes, But not it selfe in nature nor in name, Ne can they bee confounded vvithout blame: For thinges offend vs oft which haue no sense, With vvhich vve cannot angrie befor shame; For, that must haue (like vs) Intelligence VVhich can to Ire provoke our patience. For, Ire's a vehment motion of the Hart, What ?ger is Stirr'd vp by trespasse, scorne, or such like ill Offred vnto vs, wbolie or in part, Which in the high'st degree offends our will, For which, we would revenge in hast fulfill: For, each one rates himselfe by the Assise Of selfe-conceipt, by him conceaved still, From that great good which, he weenes, in him lies Which none (as he supposeth) should despise. The more therefore a Man himselfes esteemes, The better a man thinkes of himself the sooner hee is moued to anger. The more and sooner he to Ire is mou'd; Because that so great worth's despis'd he deemes, For which hee rageth, as from wit remov'd; Then, Rage to Rancor easily is shou'd; VVhich is an Anger most inveterate, What Rancor is. By Charitie and Reason most reprou'd, And God and good-men mortallie doe hate; Therefore to bee eschu'd as reprobate. For, Rancor is so fell and violent, That ioint by ioint, the Soule it rudely rends, Forgetting Iustice, and the Innocent God, man, sex, age, good, bad, or foes, or friends, Rancor is indifferent to good &amp; bad. For, this all these indiff'rently offends: Then who consults with such a Councellor, That Argumentes with tooth and naile defends, Shall bee of all (but Fiendes) an iniurer; For sure the Div'l's in such a Coniurer. Some call it honorable to revenge with the sworde all iniuries done against a m?s honor. But how can that be honorable which God abhorreth &amp; condemneth to eternall death. The quality of Rancor.VVhose furie is inflam'd so with desire To wreake it selfe on that which it enflames, That on it selfe it brings confusion dire, And oft with suddaine death her subiect shames; Heav'n, Earth, and Hell, and all therein shee blames, Nay railes against, if they wreake not her wronge, And for her selfe an Hell on Earth shee frames, To wreake it on herselfe, if shee be long Barr'd from Revenge, for which her Scule doth long. VVhich is a motion of the Hart, then vvhich None can be more immane, or violent; VVhich turnes fr? that which doth it roughly tuch And seekes to quell the same incontinent; Or on the cause to inflict punishment: A reason why angry men for the most part are pale.Here-hence it is some iresull men are pale, Because the bloud returnes from whence it went, VVhose harts haught-courage so doth ore exhale, That they dare doe what not? come Blisse or Bale. But commonly the bloud doth not returne As to the Heart it doth in Griefe and Feare, But in the face in furie it doth burne, And all the Spirits it enflameth there, As if no more vvithin the Body vvere: The bloud and sp'rits inflam'd, the braine ascend, VVhich they (confusedly distracted) stere, For how so ere heate may the Heart offend, To the brainsThe Minde doth rest, if heate it not transcend. Simil.No otherwise then as a man that drincks More then a man, yet if it not ascendes Vnto the braine, no man him druncken thinkes, Nor is he drunke though drinke his belly rends: So, though the heart, an hell of heate offendes, Yet beeing still vvithin the heart confin'd, The soule vvithin the braine her worke attendes Without disturbing of the VVit or Minde, Who wonted freedome in the braine doe finde. But giue Men wit at vvill, nay vvisedome too, (If possibly men furious Salomon denies it. Eccl. Chap 7. 11. might be vvise) And put exceeding Anger therevnto, All's to no purpose, for all in it lies As fat in fier, which to nothing fries; Moue but their choller once, and all's on flame That should them coldly any vvay aduise: For, when the soule by heate is out of frame, Her Iudgement must be blinde, and Actions lame. So that in true effect the furious Man Is good for nought, (for nought is all as good) But to blaspheme, and raue, and rayling ban, And make good men amazed at his moode; God sheild I should be any of this broode: I know no m? worse th? my selfe, God helpe me the while. Yet must I (to my shame) for shame confesse, Because its seene what humor haunts my bloud, That Anger to my heart hath oft accesse Against my will, which faine would it suppresse. He is mine arch foe gainst whom still I fight, And though I bee to weake, and he to strong; Yet fight I will, and aie in his dispight I will refraine my hands, much more my Tonge, Both vvhich in wrath are apt to Instruments of revenge. The heate of the hart maks the fingers nimble. offer wronge: Heav'n helpe me to subdue this hellish Ire, And all that doth or shall to it belong, So with the drops of grace quench out this fire, That to my heart it neuer more aspire. Yet let me coldly speake in praise of Heate, VVhich be'ng temp'rate, yeeldes most sweete effects;, The praise of Choler. For, Choler makes the VVitt and Courage great, Yea, makes the Hart abound with kinde Affects, And abiect Anger is better th? laughter for by a sadd looke the hart is made better. Eccl. Cap. 7.5 humors vtterly reiects: In the best Natures commonly its plac'd By Natures finger, for these kinde respects, And if with fury it be not disgrac'd, It should by al meanes, by all be embrac'd. How like to liuelesse Logges some Dastards are, Whose witt &amp; Courage are quite drown'd in Fleame; VVho, though wrongs prick their Harts, yet stil they fare As they vvere either dead, or in a dreame; Nothing shal moue them, be it nere s'extreame: A Coward c?not be truely honest.Heare they their fr?ds deprau'd (though nere so dear) Nay heare they Fiends the Highests name blasph?e; They dare not speake a vvord for them for feare; VVhat vse of such that such base-mindes doe beare? Simil.For as a little fire vvhen we are cold Doth vs but little good, and be'ng too great Doth warme vs otherwise then fier should; But being moderate, it so doth heat As neither letts vs coole, nor makes vs sweat: So, Choler if too little, little steeds, And if too much, too much doth make vs fret; But being meane, it many Vertues breeds, And with an actiue warmth, the blood it feeds. For to be angery and not to sinne, Is an obligatorie Ephes. 4. 26. Heast divine; For whiles we are that holy anger in (Not wholly angery) it is a signe We flame with that which doth our soules refine: For, in our Soules the iry-pow'r it is Vertue c?not performe her functi?s without anger. That makes vs at vnhallowed thoughts repine, And sober soules are zealous made by this, Then zealous soules can hardly Anger misse. Thus Ire I pleade for thee, but thou hurt'st mee; O be propitious therefore, hurt me not: Then Volumes large, Ile write concerning thee Which without blott of blame, I al wil blott VVith blacke that shal thy Glory laud. bright, make bright as hott: So, leaue I thee, and would thou me would'st leaue, Yet leaue me not, as one thou hast forgott, But mind me stil, when I should thee conceaue Gainst ill that would my soule of good bereaue. For so thou didst possesse Gods patient Soule, When he as God and Man the Temple clear'd (With VVhipps) of money-Changers, who did proule Luke 19.25. For filthie Pelse in place to him endear'd, Where most of al he should be serv'd and fear'd: So, be with me, deere Ire, till thou and I Must part,, or I by thee no further steer'd, Then may agree with perfect pietie And well may stand with true felicitie. Now from vnloving Ire doth Hatred spring, Hatred is a child of Ire. Which is more Hellish; for, its lasting Ire As some suppose; which is a damned thing, Like to the Devill her prodigious Sire, VVho Loues to hate, as Loue hates that desire: Sith God and Nature hath made Man in loue, To loue God and his like with loue intire, VVhat Vice can Vertue in man more reproue, Then that which Man to misse his Ende doth move? Yet Ire from Hatred must distinguisht be, Ire &amp; hatred distinguished.For Ire proceeds fr? some wrong done to vs, But Hatred, is conceav'd as soone as we Suppose a Creature to be odious; Though to vs it were nere iniurious: And Time can Ire aswage, but hardly Hate, Ire would but vex, but Hatred's murderous, Revenge cooles Ire, but cannot Hate abate, Ires hart can melte, but Hates is obdurate. Love linckes men togither, Hatred putts them a sunder Loue is the Linck that lincks m? kind (by kind Louing and kinde) in perfect Vnion; This Statute (sans defesance) men doth bind To succour one another woe-begon, As if they were not diverse but al one: But Hatred is the Hatchet, which doth cleeve Mankinde to peeces in confusion; Releefe refusing, and eake to releeve, Yet giues more d?mage th? it would receave. The proude and envious are like the Devill.None harbreth Hatred, but men like the Devill, (The Proud, &amp; Envious, which are ful of hate) These hateful Hell-hounds loue this lothsome Evill, Because it seekes mankinde to ruinate: VVhat can the Devill worse excogitate? It is the Toade that swells with Venome such That no force can resist, much lesse abate; The Moath of M?-kind, worse th? nought by much, Yet most indiff'rent to the Poore and Rich. A good vse of Hate.But hate inhabits Man to good effect, VVhen he loues nought, that is not perfect good; For he through Hate doth Evill still reiect, VVhich would corrupt his Nature, Mind, &amp; Moode, And make it (like it selfe) a Nihilhood: Such hate is happie, holy, and divine, By which the force of Ill is stil withstood; This Hate we ought to loue, which doth repine Hate, worthy of Loue. At al which doth not Loue aright refine. Then sacred Hate let my Loue thee embrace, And, to an Habit grow'n, inhabit mee, Sith thou flow'st from the Fountes of Loue, &amp; Grace, O let my love be ever backt by thee; Then Ill from Loue (so backt) wil ever flee. Sinfull Hate is hatefull but gratious hate is behoofull. It is a feaver of the Minde to hate, That's hate to Loue, but wh? they both agree They doe preserve the Soule in perfect state, Whilst Ill of Ills they quite annihilate. Th? hate (my Soule) that thou maist ever love That which this Hate doth loue, with loue intire, That is, al good below, much more aboue, Wherto this hate through loue would faine aspire; For perfect Love inflames iust Hates desire. No otherwise then VVater hott or cold, Simil. Though in some sorte it doth oppung the fire, Yet makes the flames thereof more manifold, VVhen it is cast thereon, so as it should. Thus Ire and Hatred may be good or ill Envy is a branch of iniustice. According to their obiects; And Envy (Their aie-familier) doth follow still Hatred and Ire, to make a Trinity; Which may be vs'd well, ill, or neut'rally: Ire &amp; Hatred the Parents of Envy. It is well vs'd for Gods foes good successe, But ill, when it anothers good doth eye, And neut'rally when it doth not transgresse The boundes of Love, for loving more or lesse. Envy is opposit to Mercy.Shee is to Mercie alwaies opposit In her true kinde; for Mercy stil doth grieue At others harmes; but envi's glad of it, And pines with paine, when others wel doe thriue, Yea liues in death, when others liue to liue. 1.Some envy others gains, that hinder theirs; 2.Some, others weale, wh? they cannot arriue 3.Vnto the like: some, other that aspires To that they sought, but faild of their desires. 4.But some there are that envy others good, Without respect of their owne benefit, Only because they think their fate's withstoode When others on the least good fortune hit, Or doe the least good, getting praise for it: The envy of the divel whatThis is the envie, than which none is worse, Ev'n that of Sathan, for Men most vnfit, This is the envie that incurres his curse, That from Heav'n for the like did Angels force. It is safer to be conversant with a Tyr?t, then with the envious pers? for the one takes away but life but the other honor and good name.For envies eies pry most of al on praise, The noblest goods, goods of the noblest Minde They most envie; and stil themselues they raise To highest vertue, where they (fixt) it finde; Heereat the teeth of envie most doe grinde: For looke how much the Minde the Corpes excels, And the Mindes riches are of rarer kinde; So much the more the hart of envie swels, At those that haue these goods, then any els. Shee is Prides second selfe, or other name, Monsters distinct, yet vndiuiduall; In heav'n and earth hath wel appeer'd the same, For both made heau'nly Lucifer to fall; So doe they Lucifers terrestrial: Pride's more appar?t, for it needs must swel; Envy is more obscure, then Pride. But envy euer lines Prides Pectorall: Pride's as the high'st, envie the lowest bell; Worse Hags th? either, can in neither dwel. Pride, before all desires to be preferr'd; If anie therefore be preferr'd before, Shee instantly is with fel envie stirr'd; And the more rise, her envie is the more. Though Meeknes mount, prids hart doth ake therfore: For shee thinkes, only shee doth al excel, Then others excellence her heart must gore: As others heav'n on earth, is Envies hell; So others rising makes Pride still to swell. For, where there is no sunne, no shadow is; And, where's no weale, or glory, envi's not: Envy is as the shaddow of vertue. Shee feedes on her owne hart, and others blisse, Shee skornes to looke so low as to their lot That are of Fortune, or the world forgot: Therefore shee lurkes about the Courtes of Kings, Envies natural home is in Kings Courts. (Whose Crownes are ever subiect to her shot) There like a Snake, that hisses not, shee stings, And oft ere shee is seene Confusion bringes. For, not without iust cause doe Poets faine That shee (as one of the infernall broode) Doth poison sucke, to vomit it againe, And makes of Snakes her flesh-consuming foode; Ovid. Met. l. 2. Simil. Which makes her like a blind-worme, without bloud: Who often creepeth like this abiect VVorme, Not wotting which way, each way but the good: And in Preferments way shee doth enorme All feete shee meets with, which none can reforme. Envie therefore the hart doth macerate, The envious are ashamed to bewray their envie.Because the Tongue dares not the griefe disclose, That makes that griefe still on the hart to grate, Which the leane looke alone in silence shoes; Yet eies shrinke in (as loth to tell the woes) Such lookes hath the envious.And looke ascue, as if in looking straight They might directly so discouer those, All which makes woe to haue the greater waight The soule and bodie so to over-fraight. Bion.One said, beholding one with envie pin'd, I know not by thy lookes (which all doe loth) If they fare well or thou ill; for thy Minde Is vext alike, alike thou look'st for both: Envy is as much grieued for others good as her owne hurt.Which subtill speech included simple troth; For, envi's griev'd no lesse for others good Then for her proper ill; and is as wroth For others praise, as if hers were with-stood, And for both, sucks alike her Subiectes bloud. Shee envies all to all, except envie, And that shee envies to, if it exceede; Like Argus, shee nere sleepes but when her eie Is charm'd by Mercuries sweete sounding Reede; Envy flattered sleepes for a while. “For envie flattered is well agreed: When all respect is had of her and hers, And all neglected els, her All to feede, No more, till shee neglected be, shee stirres; Then as before her selfe shee straight bestirres. The sunne at highest shee resembles right (Though base shee be and darke as nether Hell) Simil.For as the sunne obscureth things most bright, And makes the light of things obscure, excell: So envie seeks men famous most to quell, Before how many the more the envious person slandereth a man, the more high in glory hath he plac'd the crown of the slandered if he take it patiently. And praiseth most, men least deserving praise, Such as their deerest fame to shame doe sell; All such (if any at all) shee most doth raise, And all men els, doth most of all dispraise. The more Men want of what they faine would bee, The more their want with envie is supplide, The lesse, if prowde, they are in their degree The lesse they can their betters farre, abide; “And horse prowd Beggars, they like Kings will ride. Each Vice caries with it its own torment. Now as each Vice doth in it beare about An inbred plague: so in this doth reside The plague of plagues; to weare it selfe quite out With fretting gainst the rich or roiall Rowt. The envious, privie to their owne defects, Doe witnesse to themselues their small esteeme, For which the VVorld, they see, them still reiects, Through which they inly burst with griefe extreme, The envious condemne themselues for most vnworthy men. No affection is lesse disclosed then envy But dare not let the world them envious deeme. For, no Affect is lesse disclos'd then this, Because it makes men lesse then worthlesse seeme, Therefore the much more dolorous it is; “For griefes doe breake the heart if vent they misse. What Common-weales, and mighty Monarchies, What glorious Kings, and famous Generals, Yea (which is strange) what heau'nly Hirarchies Whose wretched state and miserable fals (By envie wrought) remaine in Capitals! Whence all may see, how actiue and how fell This Furie is, who rests in Funerals: Or when on earth Men rest in such an Hell, Envies rest in funerals. That to th'infernall may be Paralell. Envie is the parent of Iealousie. From Envy springs ay-watchful Iealousie, (Ore-plus of Loue, as iealous Lovers would) Which (worse then Hell) hates al Rivalitie, And cannot brooke that any other should Possesse that wee or ours would, or doe hold: Yet some restraine it onely vnto Loue; For being (as they say) more manifold, It Obtrectation is Iealousie in the largest Sense. Obtrectation hight, which who doth prove Shal finde the Minde vnlike it selfe to moue. For, she can thinke of nought but that alone That makes her iealous, and when shee's restrain'd Of former freedome, shee is not her owne; But like a Body bound t'a Racke, is pain'd, And thinks of nought but paine be'ng so constrain'd: This is the Linx in Loue that never sleepes, Iealousie a Linx in loue.And oft (too oft) by Lust is entertain'd, Who through nine walles of Mudd, or Mettle peeps, And so (like Argus) Loves beloved keepes. Now, as the thinges belov'd are good or badd, Iealousy good or bad according to her obiect.So iealousie is good or badd thereby. If Men be iealous of their thoughts that gadd From the chiefe-Good, good is that iealousie; How Iealousie is good.And in a Prince tis no impiety, When he suspects Ambition in his State; Nor in the mari'd ist an Heresy, If loving-iealousie without debate Doe keepe each others Love from cause of hate. Like may bee sedd of Parents, Kinne, and Frendes, So longe as it aymes but at like respect, An harmelesse iealousie, from harme defends Those whom they governe, and by kinde affect: Such ieal'usie doth in God our good effect; Gods iealousy touching vs doth procure our good. Which makes him watch vs, where wee wake or sleepe, VVho in his loue thereby doth vs protect, From al those vnseene ills that on vs creepe, And by the same his honor safe doth keepe. But iealousie conceau'd through cause vniust, Evil Iealousie Be it in VVeddlocke, Freindshippe, or where not, Makes Loue a Languishment; for false mistrust Is not by God, but by his Foe begott, Which Loue with Lust doth evermore besott: Hence come the Quarrells twixt the mari'd Paires, When they through iealousie are overshott, This makes Affraies too oft of great Affaires, Quarrells raised through Suspiti? causlesse. And ruynes that which loyal Love repaires. The fell disturber of Loves sweete repose, Iealousy, what. Copesmate of Care, tormenter of the Minde, The Canker of faire Venus sweetest Rose, The Racke that over-racks the over-kinde, The over-watchful Eye of Loue stil blinde: The Hart of Caution wherein ay are bredd The vital Sp'rites of Arte to State assign'd; Soule of Regard, alive when it seemes deade, All this is Iealousie that holds the Heade. The Caucasus whereto Loues Hart is bound, Prov. 6. 34. The Vulture which the thoughts thereof devoures, The Primum mobile which turneth round The Braine, which to the rest vnrest procures, A Sore which nought, that's good for ought, recures, That's Mummy made of the meere Hart of Love, A temp'rall Hell, whose torment still endures, The Pennaunce of Mistrust, which Lovers proue, All this is Iealousie which I reprove. And now to ende (where we should haue begunne When we began to touch corrupt Affects) With Pride, because from her al Vice doth runne Ecles. 10. 14. 19.(As from the Fountaine) which the Soule infects; Which may be thus describ'd by her effects: A swelling of the Hart which doth proceede From Selfe-conceite, that gainst the Soule reflects, Pride what.And showes more glorious then it is indeede, Which makes vs thinke our gifts al mens exceede. The proude person hates pride in all but in himself. This Prodigie, this more then mounstrous Pride, This Soules envenomn'd Botch, This Sourse of Sinne, Can nothing lesse th? hir owne selfe abide, When shee doth see her selfe another in: If shee her selfe doth hate, what can shee wynne But hate of all, that see her as shee is? Still loth'd may shee be, for had shee not byn, We stil had liv'd in earthly Heavens blisse, And Lucifer held heav'nly Paradis. Sith Man was made a creature sociable, And that his liues-ioy should therein consist, What vice in man is more detestable, Then that which doth this ioy of life resist? For Pride, as if shee were with nature blist Pride holdes all in scorne but her selfe.That farre surmounted more then half-divine, Scornes al Humanity; if so, what ist On Earth that shee thinks (be'ng so superfine) Worthie to suite her, but alone to reigne? Shee (swelling Toade) lookes with disdainful Eyes If Humility be the mother of true piety, what is Pride, her contrary?On highest things that are sublunarie, And (Lunatick) aboue the Moone doth rise In minde, though she mindes nought but villany, So to aspire to highest Dignitie: Therefore the most prowde are most ignorant Of wisedomes hid in blest Theologie, Because they meerely minde things miscreant, As earthly pompe, and port extravagant. If not impossible, yet hard it is, For the most learn'd and lowly wel to know Themselues in ev'ry part, and not to misse; Then sith the Prowd doe never looke so low, That skil nere comes but with their overthrow: The proud are taught to know themselues by their proper overthrow. For they by nature are most prone to pride That know all but themselues; and yet doe show They know themselues too wel, for, nought beside They loue; which loue, that knowledge doth misguid. For who so lookes with vvell-descerning eies (If he be mortal, be he what he wil) Into him selfe, he wil him selfe despise; For in him selfe he findeth nought but ill, He that knows himselfe best esteemes himselfe least. Corrupting Soule and Body, Minde, and VVill: The best shall finde but matter too too bad To humble them, and so to keepe them still; The worst shal see ynough to make them mad, Seeing themselues through Ill, so ill-bestad. Al vnder Heav'n mans pride hath made so vile, So fraile, so ful of sorrow and vexation, All vnder the Sunne is vanity and vexation of Spirit. Eccles. 1. That should a Man possesse al, yet the while He should possesse but temporall damnation; And with it likely divine indignation. Can Men be prowde then, of an earthly hell, Affording nought but griefe and molestation? Or can their harts with Pride and Sorrow swell When one puffes vp, the other downe doth quel? Proude men are senselesse in the strictest sense.If so they can, it is for want of sense To feele the griefes that are most sensible; And senselesse Soules haue no preheminence Of humane Nature; nor extensible To brutish, which is not insensible: Then what are proud Soules by this iust accounte But either deade, or comprehensible In that of Plants; which from Earth cannot mount, But that a worthlesse VVren may them surmount. The Eyes that Sunne-bright Robes, or smoke of praise Doe dimme, are feeble-sighted, and such Eyes Cannot themselues as high as Heaven raise, Nor pierce to Hell which in their Owner The proude haue Hell with the Prince thereof abiding in their hartes. lies: For if they would or could in any wise, Pride could not possibly surprise their Hart, For Heav'n they would admire, and Hell despise, And from that Hell they would their Eyes convert, To highest Heav'n, and from it nere divert. Simil.But as the Toade to venome turnes her foode (How pure so ere it be) shee feedeth on: So Pride turnes Vertue to her venom'd moode, Then which no prid's more neere Damnation; Spirituall pride God doth most detest.For sp'ritual pride God hates as he doth none: Which pride is Luciferian, and the fall Of those, whose Soules are with it over gon, Shal be like Lucifers, for no one shall Over-weening, an odious Vice.Be sav'd that weenes his vertue passeth all. Pride is a winde that makes the Soule to swell, And without Issue it the same wil rend: Therefore the proude their owne perfections tell; Yea, onely tell of what them most commend, And with whom not, for praise they stil contend; Prov. 13. 10. Which if they misse, or others praised more, Out goth that wind, (which they with th?drings s?d) Against al those that are preferr'd before, And as distracted, raile, and rave, and rore. Doth Pride a Tenent hold, it must be so, Although it cutt the Throate of Reason quite; The proude obstinate in their opini?. All her opinions can abide no No: And though them to defend shee hath no might, Yet to defend them shee wil rage and fight: No time, no truth, nor no authoritie, Shal putt Pride, if shee wrong be, in the right; For shee desires to haue the masterie In al, that al may give her dignitie. Nothing so much shee dreades, as to be deem'd Any's inferior in any thing; This makes her loth to learne, sith shee hath seem'd To know much more then al, by her learning: She Reproofs do enrage the proud, though for their good bestowed. scornes reproofes that information bring; Her Vices shee wil haue for Vertues tane, Or like a Serpent shee wil hisse and sting, Blaspheme and what not, for shee's most profane, And if shee can, be her impugners bane. The frendshippe is as dang'rous as vnsure, Where The proude m? the dr?ckard and the Coward are nought to make fiends. of; the proud will scorne thee if he our start thee in fortunes, the dr?kard will in wine bewray thy secrts, for what is in the hart of the sober, is in the tongue of a drunkard, &amp; the Coward dares not speake one word in defence of thy reputation though hee heare it slanderously depraved. Pride hath any place in any frend, Pride wil the downfall of a friend procure If by such fall the proude friende may ascend, For al his frenshippe to himselfe doth tend; Comes good from him, to him must goe the praise, As if good in him did begin and end; So robbes God of his glorie many waies, And faine aboue his God himselfe would raise. If he with fained modestie doth vaile His height of Pride, and doth himselfe dispraise, Tis but the higher to advance the Saile Of swelling Pride, which he to Cloudes doth raise, Nay th?der-cracks the Clouds, that clouds his praise: The highest Heau'ns (he weenes,) must giue it way Vnto the Throne where perfect glorie staies, Sith the Earth cannot hould her, Hell must and can.And there sitt cheeke by Iowle with Glorie ay; This, Pride desires, and those that her obay. If shee associate Learning, shee wil leade That Heav'nly Lady into Hellish waies; Then shee misledd, each Soule must needes misleade That on her seeming-wel-stai'd Iudgment staies; Pride the Fountaine of all Heresies.Hence spring al Heresies; which Pride doth raise: For lett a Scholer famous for his skill Maintaine dam'd Error, he for peevish praise Wil ransacke Bookes and Braines to do it still, Though he thereby his Soule with Millions spill. For should we harrow al the Soules of those, The Soules of al the Heades of Heresies, We shal finde Pride did thereto them dispose, That they might liue to al If a man live Soule &amp; Bodie in Hell to all eternities that his name may live in the mouthes of men to all posterities, he hath but an hellish purchase. Posterities In Mouthes of Men, though but for Blasphemies: Knowledge puffes vp, and if the dewes of Grace Swage not the swelling, it so high wil rise, That Earth nor Heav'n shal hold it in that case, Till Hell doth take it downe and it embrace. The knowledge of the Best consists in Each man seemes to know more then he doth. show, This Man is wise compar'd with one more fond; Yet this great wise man nothing lesse doth know Then he would seeme to know, and vnderstand: Suffizeth him he beares the VVorld in hand That he is wise and learned; Nothing lesse: But wise in this, that can Mens thoughts command To thinke him wise, when should he truth confesse, His wisedome were but wel-cloakt foolishnesse. Latine and Greeke are but Tongues naturall, Which helpe, but not suffise to make men wise; For the effect of speech is al in all, Eccl. 39. 1. 2. 3 Sound Sentence, which from wise Collections rise Of diverse Doctrines, which VVitt wel applies: Then he that hath but Tongues (though all that are) Not the tongs but the matter contained in th? make men learned. And not the wisdomes which those Tongues c?prise, May amongst fooles be held a Doctor rare, But with the wise al Tongue, and nothing spare.

Sage Socrates is deade, and with him gon His Pupills that knew more then al the rest, Yet thought they knew farre lesse then ev'ry one, But now al seeme to know, yet know doth none.

For they haue the name of wisedome, but there be but few that haue the knowledg of her Ec. 6. 22 theirs, they are admir'd, As if their Sculls ensconst al skill and VVitt, Or with some sacred furie were inspir'd, When as (God wott) their VVitt is al-bemir'd. Wee shall bee modest if wee take not that vpon vs which we haue not, and brag not of that which we haue.Yet all take on, as if all were their owne, So tis, all thinke, or few know otherwise, Which few perhaps as well as they haue stolne, (Borrow'd I would say) but yet they are wise Not to detect each others pilferies:) The greatest skill these present times affoord Is others If any where I haue followed our newe learning and Time in their fashion, Time and Learning ought the more to favor me, c?sidering how little I am beholding to them both sayings cleanely to comprise In ours: so that it be not word for word, Which wit with moderne wisedome doth accorde. But say a Man knew al, that Man can know, Yet doth the The Divels knowledge far exceedes mans. Divell know more then that Man; What cause of pride then can it be to show Lesse knowledge and more pride then dam'd Sathan, Who hath obseru'd all since the VVorld began; Nor doe the Elementes repugnance marre His wits; for he of Aire consists, and can Command the same: But in The warr of the Elements in man mars his wit.

No one excels him (but that Three in One) In wondrous workes, which may amaze the wise; But that same onely-wise Trin-vnion Workes Miracles, wherein all wonder lies; For Miracles aboue all VVonders rise, The Divels wonders are Mira, non Miracula.

In which respect, t'was meet'st to make Records Of memorable Accidents of Time, Of Princes liues and actions of great Lordes, Which Poets first did Chronicle in Rime; And farre aboue Chronography did clyme: For they were first of al that did observe (Though Poets now are neither flush nor Prime) The workes of Nature for Mans vse to serve, But now gainst Nature their works make th?

And how they did each other so comprise That in their motion they made melody, Caus'd by their closnesse and obduracy. Yea, sought to finde each substance seperate, And in their search they were most curious Of divine Essenses to know the state, VVhich having found, were most laborious Them to expresse in Poems precious: They were therefore the first Astronomers Poets were the first Astronomers Metaphisicks, and Philosophers.

Thus much for Poets, and sweete Poesie, In whose praise never can be said too much: Yet Pride their praise may blemish vtterly, For she defiles like pitch what she doth tuch: And maks both heau'n &amp; earth at it to grutch: For no Perfection can be toucht with pride But it wil looke as if it vvere not such, Deform'd in fauour, which none can abide; For Grace is base being thus double dide.

Hippocrates.For in the braines Hippocrates it puts, Strato.And Strato, in the space betweene the eies; Diogenes.In the harts hollow veine the Dog it shuts, That alwaies in a Tub enkenell'd lies: Stoickes.The Stoicks say, the Hart doth it comprise: Democritus.In al the body, saith Democritus: In al the brest, say others as vnwise: Hierophilus.In the braines ventricles, saith Hierophilus: Thus al in al were most erronious. Empedocles. Empedocles in bloud the same doth bound: Galen. Galen would haue each limb a soule to haue: Renowned Galen, how wast thou renown'd, That didst thy selfe so foolishly behaue! Thus for the place they with each other straue, And for the soules continuance no lesse. Epicures.The Epicure the bodie makes her Graue, And dies and lies with it. But some confesse Shee's capable of everlastingnesse. Pythagoras. Pythagoras, by transmigration Wil haue it everlasting, or at least As long as beasts shal haue creation; Man is the Horiz? between Angels and Beasts as far from Beasts as Angels.For it doth passe (saith he) from M? to beast: What Foole could more ridiculously iest? Yet he disciples had, and not a few, That this grosse doctrine did with ease disgest; Therefore no Beasts, these more beasts, euer slue Sith they their fr?ds souls held, for ought they knew. The Stoickes, held the meane tvvixt Epicures And Pythagoreans: for that soule (they say) That's vicious, vvhilst the body it immures, Doth die, and vvith the bodie quite decaie: But if it vertuous be, it liueth aie: Some partes of it (as Aristotle holdes) Aristotle. That haue seates corp'ral, with them fal avvay: But vnderstanding vvhich no Organ holdes, (As free from filth) Æternitie infoldes. Thus for their ending or continuance Do they contend; &amp; no lesse Christi?s striue For their beginning: some, the same advance Christians differ touching the soules beginning. To heav'n, and say they there did ever liue Since Angels fel. And other some beleeue That one soule doth another propagate: Some others, their commencement do deriue From time that first the Angels were create, Which sacred Austine doth insinuate. Others there be, who constantly affirme That soules created are from day to day, Which he of Aquine boldly doth confirme: Thomas Aquinas his opinion touching the soules beginning. For sith the soule doth forme the bodies clay, It with the bodie must be made, they say. Whereto agrees each moderne Schoole-divine: So that these Men doe from each other stray Touching the soules birth, which they mis-assigne, “For they speake ill that cannot wel define. And Epicures the same doe mortal make: The Pythagoreans it doe transmigrate; Some say, the heavens do the same retake: Diverse opinions concerning the souls continuance. Some put it into hell, in endlesse date: Others would haue it earth perambulate. Some say there's but one vniversal soule, Whereof particulars participate; Which saying Plato doth not much c?trole, Plato. But that he would haue either to liue sole. Some, make each Man two distinct soules to haue, The Intellective, and the Sensitive, And that the Sensitiue the parents gave, But the Creator the Intellective: Others, the soule doe of the same deprive, Some make two distinct things of the Soule and vnderstanding.For they the soule and Vnderstanding part. Some make no difference, but doe beleeue The Vnderstanding is the chiefest part; Thus in Conceite they from each other start. Some suppose that humane soules are por tions of the divine nature.Some, held opini? Soules are bred in Heav'n, And of the divine Nature portions are, Deckt with al vertue, by that Nature giv'n, Togeather with al skill &amp; knowledge cleare, Which in that nature ever doe appeare: From whence they did descend to animate Mens bodies, which by nature filthie were; Which did those pure Soules so c?taminate, That they those Skills &amp; vertues quite forgat. So that they could not vse th? further foorth Then they were taught, which made th? to suppose That what skill, vertue, or what other woorth Our minds do remember Sci ences, not learne them. Plato.The Soule bewrai'd, was but a minding those It had in Heav'n, and so knowes al it knoes: So that the portions of the divine fire Be'ng wel neere qu?cht by Blood, which th? orefloes, Must be rekindled and made to aspire By Doctrine, which the spirit doth desire. Wheron they do c?clude, that sith the soule By entring in the Body most vncleane Is made prodigious, and extreamely fowle, To Heav'n c?not Truth it selfe faith, no vncleane thing can enter into the heavens. Galat. 5. 21. returne be'ng so obscene, Till it by Discipline, bee purged cleane; And decked with the rights of her Birth-right, Which to regaine, Instruction is the meane: Or from the Body being parted quight, They may be purg'd, some saie, though most vnright. Now, when we ballance al these Arguments In the sincere Scales of the Sanctuary, Wee finde them viler then VVitts Excrements, And lighter then the Skumme of Vanity: For true it is The Blinde eates many a Fly. A Proverb. But that Man hath a Soule, none is so blinde, But sees her almost with Eyes bodily: And that shee's endlesse the dymst Eyes of Minde By Natures dymest light, may lightly finde. God is a sp'rite, the VVorld a Body is, God and the world are epitomiz'd in man. Both which in Man are plaine Epitomiz'd, Of God hee's Abstract in that soule of his; And in his Corps the VVorld is close c?priz'd: As if the divine VVisedome had devis'd To bring into a Centers Center all His greatnesse, that cannot be circuliz'd, And the huge magnitude of the Earthes Ball; For Microcosmos men Man fitly call. Microcosmos. Who in a Minute can the Earth surround, And sincke vnto her Center, then ascend The agilitie, subtilty, and capacity of the Soule. And c?passe, with a trice, the Heav'nly Ro?d Yea Heav'n &amp; Earth at once doth c?prehend Not touching either; But doth apprehend A thousand places, without shifting place, And in a moment ascend, and descend To Heav'n &amp; Hell, &amp; each of them embrace; It selfe being compast in a little space. This, Man can doe without the Bodies aide, Man is said to be man in respect of his humane Soule.Then must doe it as a Man he is; And in respect of his soule he is said To be a Man, for by that Soule of his And onely by that Soule, he acteth this: When the Minde is busie the outward Senses be at rest.Which seeth when the Bodies eyes be clos'd, And when those Eyes bee ope, oft sight doth misse: It travels wh? the Body is repos'd, And rests wh? as the same by Toile's dispos'd. Th'external senses may loose all their pow'r, If but the Instruments of them decay, Yet Life and Reason may continue sure; But Senses stay not if Life doe not stay, Life &amp; Sense depend vpon the Soule.And Life the soule doth stay or beare away: The more the Corpes decaies, so much the more The soule is strengthned; which sick-men bewray, Who when their Bodies are most weake and poore, Their Minds reveale most strength, and riches store. The Soule is no Quality but a Subst?ceThen its a substance and no Qualitee, For Qualities in Substances subsist; Th? that which makes another thing to Bee, No Quality can be, but doth consist In its owne substance, which doth sole exist: Then sith a man's a man, that is to say A lyving Creature with right Reason blist, He hath a soule that forms, &amp; him doth sway, Else were he but a livelesse Lumpe of Clay. Which soule is Bodilesse, else could it not The Soule is of capacity to comprehend Heaven and Earth.Containe so many Bodies smal and great, By some of which it would be over-shott; For al this All, were it much more c?pleate, In it may sit, without place for a Seate. Yet doth our bodie bound it, which is smal, But wert a Corps it could not doe that feate; For that which can containe Heav'n, earth, and all Which they containe, cannot be corporall. The more it hath, the more it vvill receiue, The more it holdes, the more it doth desire, The more the soule doth the more it may receiue. The more things bee, it best doth them conceaue, VVhether they be distinct or els intire; All which at once may in the Soule retire Without disturbing or annoying either: All which t'effect doth such a Soule require, The soule is in a sorte infinite. That infinite had neede be altogither, And in a sort the soule can bee no other. We may in Minde conceaue anothers Minde; Then, that which can conceaue things bodylesse Can be no body (though pure as the winde) But meerely Sp'rituall, which may haue egresse Into each Sp'rite, and from thence make regresse, Without those Sp'rites perceaving of the same: We may enter into anothers minde with our mind Then must the substance that makes such accesse Bee immateriall in deede and name; The soule therefore is of a sp'rituall frame. Two formes at once of quite repugnant kinde No Matter can receaue: but the soule can; No matter c? hold 2. formes at one instant of contrary kindes. Black, VVhite, Fire, Frost, Moist, Dry, these place doe finde Without resistance in the soule of man; Then soules wee see at Matter nere began: Nay, sith the lesse with Matter we doe mell, The lesse flesh the body hath the more wit the soule hath commonly. The more we vnderstand: it followes than, That nought can more against the soule rebell Then matter, which the soule doth hate as Hell. For, wer't Materiall, whereof ist made? If of the Elements, how give they sense That never Life since their creation had? Much lesse then can they giue Intelligence, That cannot give Sense: that is s?slesse, nor intelligence that is vnintellectualIn whom nor Life nor sense hath residence: A Body's meerely Passive; But the Sp'rite Is absolutely Active: And from thence The Bodies Actions doe derive their might, Or els no Limbe could stirr or wr?g, or right. And that the soule is an immortall Minde (Not mortall, like the Body) doth appeere, That whereas Time in his turnes, vp doth winde The Bodies subst?ce, which those turnes doe weare; The Soule not subiect to Time.Yet can those motions, the soule nothing steere; But to more staidnesse, they the same doe turne, And make her more immortall (as it were) VVho (like the Pow'r divine) can Time adiorne, Or make it stay, or it quite overturne. The Time past, present, or to come, are all (As to the soules sire) present to the soule, VVhich makes her matterlesse and immortall; For that which can stay Time, when he doth rowle, Must be Divine, nought else can Time controule: Time is the Soules subiectThen Time is subiect to the soule (wee see) VVhich as his Sov'raigne him doth over-rule, And though in Time the soule was made to Bee, Yet shee makes Times turnes to her tunes agree. The Soules food (Truth) argues shee is immortall like her foode.Beside, her Food doth her immortall make, For mortall Creatures feede on mortall things, As Beastes on Grasse, and Beasts mens hunger slake; But shee doth feede on Truth, which truely bringes Immortall state without al varyings: For Truth's as free from al corruption, As from Tymes Turnes &amp; restlesse alterings, Th? sith the Soule doth feede on Truth alone, It needs must be immortall in Reason. What soule can doubt her immortality, The doubt of our Soules immortality, prooves their immortality. But such as is immortal? for that doubt Doth rise fr? Reas'ns discourse ingeniously; Then if by Reason shee brought that about That souls are mortal: That soul's not without The pow'r of Reason: &amp; who hath that pow'r, Must needs be of that rare Cœlestial Route, Which Iron Teeth of Time cannot devoure: For Reas'n made Time, and past Time doth endure. God the Foun taine of Reason. No Soule humane but covetts stil to Bee, VVhich could not be if shee but mortal were: The eternitie past, overwhelmes the Soule as being too great for her capacitie, but that which is to come she can and doth c?ceave. VVhen shee lookes backe Æternitie to see, Shee sees she cannot past beginnings beare; But be'ng begun would faine past Time appeere: Then how is it that Men are al so faine If Nature therevnto all doe not steere? But how ist naturall if it be Nature made nothing in vaine. vaine? And vaine it is, if it doe nought obtaine. If ever thou resolved wer't to dye, Consider how thy Soule discoursed then: Coulde shee perswade her selfe that shee must fly The Soule c?not possiblie perswade her selfe that shee is mortall. (Sith shee was made of nought) to nought agen, And as Beastes died, so did mortal Men? Maugre thy soule while shee doth thus discourse, Shee slipps from al Conclusions, and doth ren Quite from her selfe by Natures proper force, To weigh which way she wends, free'd fr? her Corse. The damned Epicurean-Libertine At Deathes approach, (stirr'd vp by Natures might) To Life immortall would his Soule resigne; No Athist but would faine dye the death of the righteous.And in his soule resistlesse reasons fight, To proue the soule immortal by Birth-right: Doe what he can his Thoughts to pacifie Whiles they immortal striue to make his Spright, He cannot for his soule them satisfie, But they wil stil beleeve shee cannot die. If one weake thought say thy soul's but a Blast, That with thy Breath is vapored to nought; A stronger thought saith it doth ever last, For nought can mortal be, that hath that thought: The Soule is taught by naturall reason, &amp; by the light of nature that shee is immortall.By Reason thus the soule is inly taught. If wandring thoughts perswade that Soules depend On that which Nature in the Bodie wrought, Domestick thoughts against those thoughts contend, And say, Soules Bodilesse can never end. They came from God, to him themselues they lift, They mount as high as they dismounted bee; Simil.Ev'n as a Fountaine doth her Current shift As high, as it descended, naturallie: So Soules doe mount to him of whome they Bee. Beastes know no more but natures partes externe, But our soules into Natures secrets see; Nay stay not there, but they thereby doe learne VVho gaue them sight such secrets to discerne. Some say the Soule and Bodie are but one, Because their outward Sense perceaues no more: They might denie God too by like reason Because they see him not: yet evermore They see his deedes, for which we him adore. Then let the actions of thy soule perswade The actions of our Soules proue their immortalitie. Thy thoughts thou hast a soule; &amp; let the lore Which God in her infus'd, wh? he her made, Teach thee to know that thy soul c?not fade. The soule consists not by the outward The Soule is not subiect to the impression of the Senses because she is of an incorporall nature. sense, But by the soule the outward sense consists: The outward sense hath no Intelligence, (VVhich in and by an Instrument subsists) But as an Instrument sense her assists: The sense can see a Fort, but if w'inferre, Men made the same, and it the Foe resists, This doth surmo?t the outward senses farre, And doth conclude, our soules aboue th? are. The Soules discourse surmountes the reach of the outward sense Our Reason often giues our sense the lye, Wh? sense would misinforme th'Intellig?ce: For sense gaine-saies the Heav'ns pluralitie, But Reason proues the same by consequence: The Moone at full hath greatest light saith sense, Our Reason doth oft correct our erring sense. But Reason by cleere Demonstration Doth proue her then to haue least radience: Then Reason by this illustration The soule, not sense, makes Her foundation. The Sunn's one hundred sixtie six times more The Sunnes magnitude. Then the Earthes Globe in compasse; but the sense VVith Tooth and Naile with-stands it evermore, And saies, (nay sweares) ther's no lesse difference Then twixt the Center and Circumference: But Reason by right Rules them both doth meate, VVhich shee hath made by her experience; And findes the Sunne (as erst we said) more great By Demonstration is the Piller wheron al sci?ce dep?ds. Demonstration more then most compleate. We by our soules conceaue (as erst was said) VVisedome and knowledge bee'ng incorporal: But outvvard sense is altogither stai'd, On qualities of things meere corporall: The soule, by reason, makes rules general The Soule makes generall rules of many particulers: but sense insists vpon particulers.Of things particuler: but sense doth goe But to particulers material; The soule by the effect the cause doth sho, But sense no more but bare effectes doth kno. The true ess?ce of things is vnknowne; and to man knowne by their accid?ts and actions.The proper essence of things is obscur'd, And by themselues of vs cannot be knowne: Therefore the knowledge of them is procur'd By accidents and actions of their owne, Which to the soule by wits discourse is showne; Who vn-derst?deth his waies? and the storm that no man can see? for the most part of his works are hid Eccle. 16. 21.For, she concludes by Reasons consequents (Though of themselues they meerely are vnknown) That thus they are; which high experiments Lie farre aboue the reach of sense ascents. In th? which wil not vnderstand true doctrine ignorance is sinne, and in them which c?not, it is the paine of sinne.In them which wil not vnderstand this Truth, Their ignorance is sinne most pestilent; But they which cannot, (ah the more the ruth) Their ignorance, of sinne's the punishment: And who denies a Truth so evident, Hath neither grace, nor sense; for all may see The soul's immortal, and divinely bent, And hath most force when shee from flesh is free, Which proues her powre and immortalitee. If soules and bodies then be so distinct, The soule is free from sin as shee was made by God.And that the soule, as she of God was made, Is free from sinne, and by her owne instinct Shee hates that sense that doth to sinne perswade, How is it then that shee should be so bad? Sinne deriues her force fr? the soule. To God all things are law full that like him, and nothing likes him that is vnlawfull. For from the soule, sinne doth her force deriue, Which with her waight the body doth orelade; Can shee both cause, and yet against sinne striue? Shee may (quoth All) but few doe it beleeue. This is a Gulffe that swallowes vp the soule, And quite confounds her, if shee enters it: This secret deepe, deepe wisedome did enroule, In that still-closed booke of secrets, fit For Her alone to know, not erring wit. Therefore the more presumption we show In search hereof, the more are we vnfit A secret so vnknowne as this, to know: For they know most thereof whose sp'rits are low. The lesse sobrietie vve vse herein, The more we Some certaine things though true are not vttered of God without d?ger wh? we seem best to knowe when we confesse him and his councels to be incomprehensible. erre in by-pathes of Offence; And (giddy-headed) headlong fal to sinne, From which we hardly rise by penitence; For sinnes presumptuous, grace doe most incense. Then let vs In doubtfull matters wherin we may be ignorant without danger, it were better suspend out iudgements then offer occasion of contention Calv. curbe our head-strong thoughts, when they Would run beyond the reach of sapience; And make them stop, where wisdome points a stay, That is, to go no further then they Warrantably. may. Many a curious Question hath bin mou'd Touching this Divine matters are ful of obscurity. Cat. secret, and no fewer Iarres Hath it procur'd; and all to be reprou'd; Sith ev'ry one his owne conceite preferres, Which to maintaine, stil maintaines wilful warres. This secret must be lookt vnto not into. Some so desire to know, that faine they would Breake through the Faithfull ignoraunce is better then rash knoweledge. Bounde that humane knowledge barres To pry into His brest which doth infold Secrets vnknowne: These, strange opinions hold But let it vs suffize thus much to know, That though the soule cannot be soild with sinne As God created her; yet sinne doth flow From Sinne flowes from Adam to the soule, and enters into her when she first giues motion to the body. The fault of Adam only infects the soule Adam to the soule; and enters in When shee the bodie doth to moue begin: Nor must we make her sinnefull in respect Shee with the Corpes is Cas'd, as soild therein, But make the Fault of Adam her infect, VVhich is, indeede, sole cause of that effect. At large to proue her immortalitie, I should (like her) well-neere be It is farre off, what may it be? and it is a profo?d deepnesse, who c? finde it? Eccl. 7. 26. infinite; For, if the Image of the Deity Bee found in Man, in his soule it is right: And though by Adam shee bee made vnright, Yet by the second Adam (full of grace) Shee is againe Since the elementary &amp; diuine partes of M? are corrupted one by another and both from Ad?, they must be borne againe, by elementary &amp; divine meanes, by Water and the Spirit. reform'd and made vpright, Which makes her striue when sin would her deface, To foile it, or at least not giue it place. Inough my Muse of that, vvhich nere ynough Can well be said, and let me (restlesse) rest; For, I must ply my Penne which is my Plough, Eccl. 25. 3. Sith my lifes sunne is almost in the VVest, And I provided yet but for vnrest: Time flies avvay, these Numbers number time, But goodes they number not: for their int'rest Is nought but Aire, which though to heau'n it clime, Is but meere Vapor rising but from slime. There is no end in making many bookes, and much reading is a wearinesse of the Flesh. Eccles. 12. 12. Yet this we doe, and pleasure take in toile Although we doe but plow the barraine Soile. FINIS. An Extasie. Wether, entranc'd, or in a dreame of dreames, Procur'd by Fancy in our sleepes extreames, Or vvhether by a strong imagination, Bred in the Bowels of deepe Contemplation, My soule, vvhen as my bodie vvaking was, Did see, what doth ensue, in Fancies Glasse: I know not vvell; but this ful wel I know, If it no substance were, it was a show: A show whereat my Muse admired much, Which she with her best sense can scarslie touch; It was so strange and full of mistery, Past apprehension of her ingeny. Me thought I saw, (at least I saw in thought As on a Rivers side I lay long-straught Eyeing the VVaters eie-delighting glide) An heauenly creature more then glorifide Vpon the waues come tripping towards me, Who, scarse the water toucht, did seeme to flee: Her face was louely, yet mee thought shee lookt As one that had long time and travell brookt. The Robe she ware was lawne (white as the Swanne) Which siluer Oes, and Spangles over-ran That in her motion such reflexion gaue, As fill'd, with siluer starres, the heav'nly waue. Her Browes, two hemi-circles did enclose Of Rubies rang'd in artificiall Roes: Whose precious haire thereto vvas so confixt, That golde and Rubie seemed intermixt. Vpon her head a siluer crowne shee ware, (Depressing so that rising golden Haire) In token that shee knew no marriage Bed, VVhich nerthelesse was richly garnished With rarest Pearle, that on the arched bents That rose from that rich Crownes embattlements, Did shine like that braue party-coulord Bow, That doth Heav'ns glorie, and their mercy show. About her Necke hung Natures Nature sittes in a precious Stone as in her Throne of Maiestie. Miracle, A Carcanet of glorious Carbuncle; VVhich did the Sunne ecclipse, and clos'd mine Eyes, That they could not behold her other guise. This sight (though glorious) much amated me, From which, rowzing my selfe, I sought to flee: But with the offer I fell downe againe, As one whose Legges could not his Corpes sustaine, Yet still I off'red (bootelesse) to be gon, For, Sights divine daunt the stout'st Champion At the first sight; for, Nature doth not love To see (fraile Creature) ought her selfe aboue. VVhen lo, this heau'nly Apparition, Bad me not feare, with sweete perswasion! For, I am shee (quoth shee) that lately was Thy Sov'raigne; frëed from this Earthy Masse: I now can like an Angell with a trice, Shift place to serue the Prince of Paradice. And, I am come to thee by his permission, That (notwithstanding thy obscure condition) Thou should'st by me haue light, and cleerely see (As in a Glasse) what shal hereafter bee Touching this Land, I did predominate: Looke in these VVaues (quoth shee) and see her fate. But I yet fearing lest by some delusion, I might be drawne to drowne me, in conclusion, Did backward seeme to doe this later heast, Though in the premisses I seemed blest. Then shee (as seeing with immortall eyes The mortall feare that did my Soule surprise) Skipt from the VVater to the verdant Shore, And tooke me by the hand, and cheer'd me more. Her touch, mee thought, sent to my soule such ioy, As quite expell'd, what erst did it annoy. That hand, mee seem'd, I kist with reverence, Which yeelded sense-reviving redolence: I held it fast, and swai'd it as I would, For shee encourag'd me, and made me bold. VVhen to my selfe, I wisht I had had might, T'haue swaid or staid it when it once did write, VVhen it did (shaking) write Elizabeth, Name giving Life to be a name of Death. I often haue held hands, while I haue taught Those hands to write, as (handsomely) they ought; But had I held her hand then, when it was, I would haue taught her hand all hands to passe In love-procuring skill; and when shee wrate Elizabeth great R. abridging date. Of Life and Name, shee should haue written thus, Live live great R: for dying oft for vs. And though shee had in Earth no interest Now frëed from it by eternall rest, Yet, was my soule, mee thought, extreamely glad So to converse with her immortall Shade: And to my selfe I said, with submisse voice, If Princes Shades our Spirits so reioyce; What will their Subst?ce where they please to grace? That, in the Soule must needes haue greater place. Arise (quoth shee) because the VVater's deepe, And thou (perhapps) dost feare therein to peepe: Come follow mee to yonder shadie Grove, VVhich Zephirus doth gentlie breathing moue, Vpon the further side of this greene Meade, There shalt thou see, what shall thy Fancy feede. Then vp I sprange with rare agilitie, Which gaue me pow'r, me thought, with her to flie As swift as thought, to that designed place; And there she laid me downe, with sweete embrace: VVhich so entranc'd me, as a while I laie Engulf'd in ioy, yet all the while did praie That the Catastrophe of this sweete Scene, Might answere the beginning and the meane. Shee feeling with her hand my Pulse to beate As one whose Soule did seeke to shift her Seate, Shee chafte my Temples which did showring raine The liquid Pearle which oft proceedes of Paine: And with a loving checke shee did controule, The Passion of my over-passion'd Soule. I am (quoth shee) no Soule-confounding Fiend, Assuming Angells forme for wicked end; But come to grace thee gracelesse forlorne Man VVith divine favours; why dost feare me than? VVhereto with trembling Tongue I made reply: I feare thee not, sense-mazing Maiestie; But the delight my silly Soule conceaues For this high grace, my soule of sense bereaves. VVell then I coniure thee in Loue (quoth shee) That thou feare not, But marke what thou shalt see. No sooner these sweete words accented were, But in our presence livelie did appeare A Ladie of a most maiesticke state, Cladd like a VVorld-commanding Potentate; VVith all that might obiect prosperitie, To VVitt or Observations Eagles Eye: On whom attended two still-striving Dames, In manners diverse, diverse too in frames: The one still eyde the Mould, with downe-cast looke, In blacke invested, in her hand a Booke: Her Brest close-clasped vp vnto the Chin, That no lascivious Eye might prie therein: A Cipers vaile ore-canapide her face, Where vnder shone a VVorld of modest grace. Nothing about her was superfluous, And nothing wanting, fitte for Natures vse: I tooke her for some VVorld-despising Dame, VVhose conversation was not in the same. The other was the true Arch-tipe of that Which Men for Levitie doe wonder at. Neere to her Body shee (fantasticke) ware A thinne vaile of Carnation coulor'd ware: On which, with Starrs of gold embost, was drawne As t'were an vpper Smock of purest Lawne; Which seem'd as if a Silver Cloude had spredd Over the face of Phœbus blushing redd: Vpon all which shee ware a Gabberdine, For forme as strange, as for stuffe, rich and fine: To which ther was a certaine kinde of Traine, Which (vselesse) was turn'd vp threefold againe: The VVings wherof, (where her Armes out were let) were of pure gold with Smarags thicke besett: So were the verges of it sett with stone, As costlie as the VVhores of Babilon. On either side from her Armes to her VVast, It was vnsow'd, and made with Buttons fast Of orient Pearle, of admirable size, Which loopes of Azur'd silke did circulize: So as yee might betweene the Buttons see, Her smocke out-tuft to show her levitee. The Sleeves whereof were meanely large, yet so As to the handes it lesse and lesse did gro: About whose wrists being gath'red in fine pleates, It was made fast vvith orient Bracëlets Of Pearle as bigge as Plumbes, and intermixt VVith other Iemmes, of diuers hues transfixt; Which ore her hands hunge as superfluously As (like the rest shee ware) most combrously. Morisco-wise her Garment did orehang Her Girdle, set with stone and many a spang: VVhich nerethelesse could not be seene at all, By reason of that Robes orefolding fal: Saving that when the VVinde blew vp the same It might be seene like lightnings sodaine flame. This Garment though it were but too too long, Yet too too short, or short'st of all, it hunge. Her nether Vesture strecht but to her calfe, Yet lower rought then that aboue, by halfe: For, shee the vpper tuckt and trebl'd so, As like a Vardingale the same did sho. Vpon her legges shee ware a Buskin fine, Of stuffe that did like cleerest Amber shine, Downe halfe vvay folded, vvith a Brouch below, Which on the shinne shee rightly did bestovv. Her nether smockes or smock-like Petticotes, Each gale of winde a loft in Aier flotes: Which she assisted vvith prompt reddynesse, Glad of so good a coulor (as I guesse) To show the coulor of her skinne below, Which scarse the Smocks of modest Matrones know. Her Brest lay open almost to the VVast, That by the eie, men might be drawne to taste The bitter sweetes, vvhich in her did abound; “For, beautie through the eie the heart doth wound. Her Pappes vvere varnisht ore with shining stuffe, To giue the Sight a lustie counterbuffe: Twixt whom there hung a Iewell of rare Iemmes, That the eie dazl'd with resplendant beames. About her Necke a chaine of Pearle shee ware, That to her Brest did couer all the bare; Saving that here and there yee might espie A dy-like Square of polisht Ivorie. Her Ruffe (or Rebata. what you vvill) about her Necke, Was cut and keru'd the more the same to decke: And in the cuts, betweene the foldes, did lurke Frogs, Flies, Snakes, Spiders, al of Gold-smithes work; So liuely made, as that the sight would sweare They were aliue, for each did seeme to steere. Vpon the hemme vvhereof did looslie hange Many a glitt'ring siluer-golden spang: Which, with the motion of her bodie light Did (twinckling) seeme like starres in winters night. Her face, though faire, vvas painted cunninglie, VVhich trebl'd beautie, to bewitch the eie. In center of her forehead (which did shine As if the same had beene all christalline) Betweene rare Pearles, disposed all in fret, A rich coruscant Rubie in was let. Vpon the verge of whose gold-stayning haire, Illustrious Saphires ev'nly ranked vvere: Saving that here and there prowde Pompe did place Great pointed Diamonds to giue them grace. Her haire, though faire, yet was it made to line A curled Periwicke of Haire more fine; Not haire, but golden wire drawne like the Twist The Spider spins with her vnfing'red fist. Behind, the rest was so in tramells folded (Which precious Pearle and Rubies rich infolded) That all, like speckl'd Snakes, in Knots was vvound, And ev'ry one with diverse flowres crownd. Her gate was painefull, tripping on the Toes, As if Desire should say, lo, there shee goes. Shee stood, as if she stood vpon no ground, But on some water-waue that made her bound; For, novv shee sinckes on this legge, then aloft Vpon that other shee advanced oft. And no lesse oft shee would cast dovvne her eie Vpon her Ivory paps; and vvantonly Shee seem'd to smile on beauty without peere, To dravv all vvanton eies to note it there. In summe shee vvas such as Voluptusnesse With all her coulors cannot well expresse. These damsels straue (as erst I said) to gaine The loue of her that vvas their Soveraigne: Who seem'd to each indiff'rently dispos'd; But after much adoe their strife shee clos'd With this decree; that vvho her most could moue By Reasons force, should bee her leefest Loue. Vertue.Then Vertue lo, (for so it seem'd shee vvas) With modest looke, and favour full of grace, Began to tune her tongue vnto that eare VVhich shee desired to her to indeere. Albion.Quoth shee, deere Albion, (so I knew her name That first of all into our presence came) If thou wilt me imbozome, I vvill make Both Heav'n and Earth to loue thee for my sake. Thy conscience I wil calme, and in thy brest Thou shalt perceaue the heav'n of heav'ns to rest. Thine vnderstandings eie shalbee as bright As that faire eie that al the VVorld doth light. Al Nations shal doe homage vnto thee, As vnto her that giues them eies to see. Thou shalt reduce to thine obedience Without the Sword, the Earthes circumference. The wisemen of the East shal come from farre, Drawne by thy grace, led by thy vertues starre, And offer thee Gold, Mirrh, and Frankensence, And what els may delight thy Soule or sense. Thou shalt haue powre to crush the crownes of kings And with their neighbors swords to clip their wings; If they shal rise against thee in their pride; So keepe them downe, and yet thy hands vndide. God and the VVorld (though it be nere so il) Shal hold those curst that doe resist thy will. For, thou shalt nothing wil but what is good, As long as thou and I, be one in moode. I wil breake ope Heav'ns gates with might &amp; maine, And on thy head shal Blessings powre amaine. Yea, to thy comfort it shal wel appeare That al desir'd increase shal crowne each yeare. The golden daies of peaceful Salomon, Shal ever waite thy blessed yeares vpon. The sea shal yeeld thee from her liquid VVombe, VVhat shal enrich thy poore and basest Groome. Thy Mountaines shal with cattell stil be crown'd, The whiles the Vales with corne shal ore-abound. Thy Sonns, &amp; Daughters, shal yeeld comfort to thee, That whilome did indevour to vndoe thee. Thy young-men shal see Visions, &amp; thine Old Shal dreame dreames, by which things shalbe foretold That shal concerne thy good in times future, And that prevent, which may thine Ill procure; Angels shal guard thy walles and on thy strand In legions they shal lie as thicke as Sand, To keepe thy Fo-men from assailing thee, In Battaile rang'd by Heav'ns Divinitie. Thy Schools shal yeeld thee Saints, which shal direct In Life, and Doctrine, whatsoever Sect. Thy Citties like Bee-hives shal stil containe Men as Bees busie for the Common gaine. All idle Drones that live by others sweate They shal cassiere, or not allow them meate. There shal no Begger in thy Streets be found, Nor cries of wretches at thy Gates shal sound; But, with the foizone of Heav'ns blessings all (By means of me) their Baskets fill they shall. Thy Peeres shal striue for peace, &amp; who shalbe In Vertue (not in State) in highst degree. There shalbe no Contention in thy Body, Which heretofore hath made thy m?bers bloudy. The Poole of Grace shal overflowe thy Land, Glyding in Christall streames on Pearly Sand. The Horrors that consort the hateful Crue, Shal never come so neere as in thy view. No humane quarters shal oretopp thy Gates, For seeking to ore toppe thy Maiestrates. No Heading, Hanging, Burning, or the like, Shalt need to vse, ne with the Sword to strike Those that doe weare good Swords but to badd ends; For all shal liue in peace like loving friends. The Worde Oppression, much lesse shall the deede Be never heard, where all are well agreede. Each one shal know his place, and in the same Shal laboure to preserve an honest name. One Hart, one Hand, one Faith, one Soule, &amp; Mind, Shal al thy People in one Body binde. Thou shalt not neede to feare the Chamber-scapes, The sinnes gainst Nature, and the brutish Rapes, Which with the godlesse Nations are too rife; For ev'rie Man shal have his lawful VVife: Which dulie in an vndefiled Bedd, Shal gett right Members for their vpright Head. Thou shalt not neede to pinch thy Peoples Purses, And so incurre thereby thy Commons curses: Or money-Bladders seeke, in Seas of Bloud To beare thee vp, from sincking in that Floud. For, thou shalt haue Exchequers richly stor'de, That thou to well deservers maist affoorde Roiall rewards, without the Commons Cost; For, Crownes are richly blest, with Peace y-crost. Taxe-vndergrowne, (ô odious Tyranny! Bredd in the VVombe of Sensuality) Shal nere so much as once be nam'd in thee, But thou shalt punish Kingdomes, where they bee. The cloudie Piller shall guide thee by daie, The firie Flame by night shal show thy VVaie. Beauies of Quailes, and Manna (Angells foode) Shal showre from Heav'n to doe thy Children good. Who shal therefore, sing Hymnes of praise divine, And merry make each one beneath his Vine. The voice divine shal thunder from on hie, And talke with thee (belov'd) familierly. Thou shalt with Moises Rodd divide the Deepes, And make their raging VVaues to stand on Heapes, That Man, and Horse which to thee doo belonge, Shal passe, as on drie Land, those VVaues amonge. For thine Advantage thou shalt ope the Earth, And send repyning Rebells quicke beneath, If any should arise; but doubtlesse Those Can never spring, where Vertue stil ore-flowes. If thou wilt vse me, thou wilt vse me still, For I will please thy Soule, thy VVitt, thy VVill. And though I seeme t'vncircumcized Sense But passing plaine, and ful of Indigence, Yet in my Brest true Glorie is enthron'd, And al my Friends shalbe with Glorie Crown'd. On me doe waite the Ministers of Ioy, To be dispos'd as I shal them imploy. Death, and Damnation I treade vnderfoote, And over Lethe lake with ease I flote. I am the Darling of the TRINITIE, That ore Sinne, Death, and Hell hath Emperie. When Heav'n shall melt, &amp; Earth shal meare away, I in his blessed Bozome live for aie. If thou through humaine frailtie chance to trippe, Ile stay thy foote, that downe thou shalt not slippe. Or if in mire of sinne downe flatt thou fall, Ile wring Teares fr? thine Eyes to wash off all. What shal I say? if thou wilt cherish me, Ile stil make peace betweene thy God and thee: That neither Sathan, Sinne, nor ought beside, Shall haue the pow'r your Vnion to devide. Thinke what a comfort it wilbe to thee, By me t'enioy this VVorlds felicitee, And when Confusion shal dissolve the same, Thy Soule to live with God, with Saints thy fame: VVhich al eternity shall comprehend, In ioy past ioy; thus shee vvith ioy did end. VVhen lo, the other (painted Butterfly That lookt too like voluptuous Vanity) Seem'd greatly chafed with this l?g discourse, And often mew'd and mopt; and which is vvorse The speech disgraced interruptingly, VVith VVhat might make the same seeme al a ly. But now shee gan to face her Countenance, VVith many a smile and Eye-delighting glance. And thus with voice, that did her speech become, Shee brake into her Tales Exordium. Deere Albïon, whom as my Soule I prize, In whom (as in my Heav'n) my glorie lies; If ever thou, by following sound advice, VVouldst tast the truest ioyes of Paradice, Th?, listen to me, while I breath such breath, As shal create a complete Heav'n on Earth. If thou wilt me imbrace, as did that Salomon. Prince That was the Sourse of humane sapience, Who in his wisedome knew wel what he did (Sith he knew more then al the world beside) When monge a thouz?d Loues, his wisdomes powre Did choose me for his chiefest Bellamoure: If therfore thou wilt me indeere to thee, That but one soule may be twixt thee &amp; mee, I knowing what such wisd?e high did please, Wil plunge thy soule in depth of pleasures Seas: Where thou shalt meete with Ioyes vnso?ded deepe, To lullabie thy waking Cares asleepe. But to particulate what they shalbe, Requires the Tongue of some Divinitee. Yet coldly, as I can, I wil expresse This onely heav'n-surmounting happinesse. Deere sweete, quoth she, (&amp; sweet she lisped foorth) If thou wilt well conceave thine owne high woorth, Listen to mee, and I wil tell thee vvhat Vanity is instant to gett attention because sense is betraide therby. Shal glad thy Soule, and correspond with that. As stands thy case, thou well maist prize thy Head, With the extreamest rate of Ioues God-hed: And sith aboue he raignes in boundles blisse, Thy blisful raigne below should be like his. I therefore wil draw VVit, and Industry (Al vvhose defects my science shal supplie) To straine their powres to their extreame extent, So to accomplish thy soules ravishment. Thou on triumphant Chariots (like the Sunn's, That on the cristal Heav'ns in glorie runnes) By Horses shalt be drawne, as white as milke, And al thy way shal cover'd bee with silke Of choisest kinde, and of the Tyrian die, As wel to show thy state, as please thine eie. Thy Robes shalbe pure gold ten-times refin'd, That like the Aire shal gently turne and winde: Not fac'd with Ermine, but with everie thing That to the heav'ns bright eie may wonder bring: Which shal send backe, when that eie on it stayes, (In counter change) more glittering-glorious Raies! Thy Horses heades, vvith Phenix feathers deckt, Shal vvorke on Angels eies the like effect. The pillers of thy Pallaceis shalbe Hewne out of rockes of purest Porphyree, Their wals of Iasper square, and eu'ry Ioint Dissolued Amber, passing cleere, shal point. The columnes of thy windowes shalbe Iet, Inlaide with Pearle, in many a curious fret. Their Glasse of christall: in whose vpper part With stone of price, past price, and matchlesse Art Shalbe inserted stories of thy deedes; That both the eie delights and Spirite feedes, Their Heav'n-high Roofes shalbe embattelled With Adamant in gold enuelloped. Their Tile of Currall, and in Lozenge-wise, Mother of pearle their sides shal circulize. Vpon their crest, as thicke as they may st?d, Saint George on horse-backe with a Lance in hand, Charging a Dragon, both of precious stone, To wit, the Emeral'd, and Calcedone. The roomes within, al rooft in arched wise, (Like to the Convexe of the vaulted skies) Shalbe with purest Bice enammeld faire, Enchas'd with stars, like Ioues etherial chaire! The chimny-peeces reaching through the s?e Of glorious Chrysolites, that seeme to flame: On whose fore-fronts below, cut out shalbe, In Indian Berill, curious Imageree. The hangings of thy wals, of that same ware That Salomon in al his glorie ware. Thy floores shalbe (most glorious to behold) Couerd with cloth of Bodkin, Tyssue, Gold. Thy chaire of state (t'amuse the gazers sight) Cut out of one vnvalued Margarite Shal stand on top of Twelue most faire Ascents, Like that wherein Ioue sits in Parliments. Each steppe of stone, of richest price, and hue, Deckt on each ende with beasts, of dreadful view, (Huge Lyons, Dragons, Panthers, and the like That in th'aspectors harts doe terror strike) Shal seeme like that more then celestial Throne, Which Iupiter in state doth sit vpon. Thy cloth of state that it ore-canopies, Shalbe stuffe brought from Earthly Paradise By sp'rits immortal, which shal waite on thee, And doe thy Heasts, if thou wilt rule by me. This precious geare (no name is good ynuffe T'expresse the glory of this precious stuffe) With Sunne-like Carbuncles in forme of eies Shalbe embossed, as if each were spies, Which vvith their luster creepe in each darke hole, That thou thereby maist pul thence by the Polle Who shal vnseene envie thy glorious state, So, with thy Sword of Iustice pole their Pate: And, when thou sitt'st vpon that royal seate, Thou shalt seeme Iupiter, if not more great, Sitting on his celestial Throne of Thrones Compas'd about with many thousand Sunnes! Thy privie chambers (where thou privilie Shalt glut thy selfe, vvithout satietie, With what shal tickle al thy vaines with pleasure Measur'd by loues sweete motions without measure) Shalbe like Orchards fram'd so by mine Art, That thou shalt seeme in Heav'n wh? there thou art; There wil I haue an artificial Sunne In the like Heav'n al daie his course to runne, That though the daie abroad doe lowre like night, Thy Sunne within shal shine exceeding bright. The Moone and stars (like to the lampes of heau'n) By night shal light thee, set in order ev'n: And by their constellations and their frames, Th'astronomer shal cal them by their names. Al kinde of Trees, of what soeuer sute, That either Branches beare, or Branch with fruit, There vvil I cause (or at least, seeme) to grow, That Nature from her owne them shal not know. Pl?bs, Peares, Dats, Filbeards, Apples, glistering Cherries, Pomgranats, Peaches, Medlars, &amp; Mulberies, Lymmons and Orenges, some ripe, some greene, What shal I say! al fruit that ere were seene This artificial Eden shal containe, Thine eie with pleasure stil to entertaine! Hard by shal runne, from Artificial Rockes. Confected waters sweete, vvhose falling mockes The voice of birds; which made by science shal Tune their sweete notes, to that sweete waters fal. Here shal arise an hand-erected Mounte, From whose greene side shal glide a siluer fount Encreasing breadth, as it runnes, by degrees; Hemd in with Couslips, Daffadils and Trees That ore the same an Arche of Bowes shal make, Through which the Sunne shal parcel-gild the Lake! Beneath which, in this little siluer Sea Shal bathe the daughters of Mnemosine: Singing like Syrens, playing Lyres vpon Beheav'ning so this hand-made Helicon! Behinde the Trees coucht, drown'd in Daffadillis Oxslips, wilde Cullambines, and water Lillis, Shal Elues and Fairies their abiding make, To listen to these Ladies of the Lake! Actêon here shal metamorphiz'd bee, Great Obron there shal ring his companee: And here and there shalbe varietie Of what so ere may charme the eare or eie! Vnder a gloomy Bowre of stil-greene Baies, That stil greene keepe their mortall makers praise. (Where Eglantines with flowres thrust in their Noses, Intangled with the slips of damaske Roses, Stil fresh and flourishing, as month of Maie) There shalt thou heare of loue the svvetest lay: Which shall thy greedy sense so much inchaunt, That where thou art, thou shalt be ignoraunt; And what thou art thou shalt not much respect, Sith heav'n-rapt souls that VVhat, do quight neglect. There, Angells notes shal so inchant thine Eares, That thou shalt swim in ioy, though sunck in Cares. Here Lab'rinthes intricate of winding vvalkes, Of Mirtles filld with Maie-bowes in the Balkes, Where out shal breath soule-ravishing perfume (VVhich time wil rather prosper then consume) Shal lull fraile sense asleepe in pleasures lapp, From melancholie free'd and al mishapp. Each foote of grasse-made ground, orelaid shalbe VVith Natures Daizie-decked Draperee. And therewith-al, to yeeld the more delight, Angell-fac'd Fairies (clad in vestures white) Shal come in tripping blithsome Madrigalls, And foote fine Horne-pippes, Iigges, and Caterbralls. That done, the Driads and the Silvane crue, Successiuelie thy solace to renewe, In Matecheines, Lavolts, and Burgamasks Shal hardlie plie these time-beguiling Tasks. Each Tree shal droppe downe sweete Ambrosia, Or cordial Spices, Myrrh, and Casia. The Baies shal sprinkle from their dewey Bowes, Rose-water cleere to cheere thy handes and Browes. Nought shal bee wanting in this Earthlie Heav'n, That Art and Nature to Delight have giv'n; Or by the pow'r of Spirites may bee fulfill'd, To ravish sense with al that Heav'n may yeeld! For I wil dive into th'infernal deepes, VVhere Pluto Prince of riches revell keepes, And make him dance attendance on my Traine, T'effect thy pleasure, deere sweete Soveraigne! There shalt thou see (without al cause of feare) The glorious worthies of the world that were: How Cæsar in rich Triumph entred Rome; And Scipio when he Africk had orecome! There shal the stately Queene of Amazons, Penthesilea, with her Minions, Present thee with a Maunde of fruite divine, Cull'd from the golden Tree of Proserpine! Hector, Achilles, Priam, Hecuba, Great Agamemnon, Pyrrhus, Helena, Or whom soever thou desir'st to see Shal at a beck doe homage vnto thee! Ile ripp the Bowells of the subtile Aire And bring the Sp'rits therin (in fashion faire) To counterfet the Musick of the Spheares, And with Heav'ns harmony to fil thine Eares! To fetch for thee, from the extreame extent Of Earthes huge Globe, what ere may thee content! To flie vpon thine errand with a trice, To fetch thee fruite from Earthly Paradice! To entertaine thee, when alone thou art, VVith al the secrets of each hidden Art: And whatsoere the heav'nly Cope doth cover, To thee (that thou maist know it) to discover! The Stone so sought of all Philosophers, The making of which one, so many marrs, Thou shalt directly make it at thy pleasure, T'enrich thy kingdome without meane or measure! The great Elixer (making small ones great) Like dust thou shalt make common in the Streete! And if thou wilt, high waies shal paved bee With burnisht gold, made onely but by thee! If thou wouldst haue the Aïer turn'd, and tost, To strike a terrour in each Clime, or Coste, These Sp'rits that Lord it ore that Element, Shal doe the same for thee incontinent! And when thou wouldst spare their societie, They, with a vengance, through the Aire shal flie VVithout the least hurt done to thee, or thine, Except it be in making you divine! There shal no kingdomes Cares, that life destroie, And like Hell-paines the Hart and Minde annoy, Once dare to ceaze vpon thy blisseful Hart; For I wil charme them so, by Pleasures Art, That they shal seeme as dead and never sterr, Thy solace to disturbe in peace, or vvarre. Ile reave sweete voyced Boies of what they may Ill spare, (if spare) to sing thy Cares awaie. Ile make some others spend their total time, To make sweete strings expresse the twangs of Rime; VVhich tickle shal thy hart-strings with such mirth, That thou shalt saie, ha, this is Heav'n on Earth! Thy royal-Table shalbe serv'd with Cates Surmounting farre Cœlestial Delicates: Ambrosia; shalbe thy coursest Cheate, And Manna (Angells-foode) thy Groomes shal eate! Delicious VVines, that make sweete Nectar sowre, Beauties divine in precious Boles shal powre, To comfort Nature and to glad thy Hart VVith comfort that surmounteth Natures Art. The Sarnos Pecocke, and the Malta Crane, The dainty Lamprey in Tartesia tane, The Phrigian Woddcock, and th' Ambracian Gote, The fine fish Asinellus, hardly gott, The Oisters of Tarentum, fish of Helops, The Goldny of Cilicia, Chios Scalopps, The Nutts of Tasia, and th'Ægyptian Dates, In few, all kingdomes choisest Delicates That to the Pallate pleasure may affoord, Shal oreabound vpon thy bounteous Boord! When, from a Silver'd Tent, to please thine Eare, Cornetts, Recorders, Clarions thou shalt heare: Whiles to delight thy sight as wel as hearing, Stately Dumb showes before it shal be sterring: Which wel-tongu'd Mercury shal faire relate Stil pointing to thy praise, and glorious state. VVhen, with these Sweetes thou art wel satisfied, Ile make thee Beds of flowres, divinly dide: VVhere thou, &amp; thy Loues, (for your Limbs reposes) May drownd your selues among sweet damask Roses. And while your rest, the sacred Muses nyne, (Singing ful sweetely Ditties most divine, That for Harts ioy wil cause the Eyes to weepe) Shal lullabie your blisful Soules asleepe. Continual Iusts, and roial Turnaments, Furnisht with al Eye-pleasing ornaments: Mummings, Masks, Plaies, Plaies that shal play with Care As Catt with Mouse, to kill her comming There. VVhat booteth it to weare a golden Crowne, If thorny Cares it line, to make thee frowne: Away with Care therefore, awaie with thought, VVhat shouldst thou doe with that, that's good for nought: Let th? go waite on Byshops, to whose See They doe belong, but let the Prince be free. VVilt thou be Servant to the common Trash, That often leaves their Master in the lash? Or spend thy VVitte, and Sp'rits for such Riffraffe, And so consume the Corne to saue the Chaffe? VVilt thou orewhelme thy selfe in all anoy, That they may swime aloft in Seas of Ioy? VVhat! wilt thou place thy pleasure in thy paine, And make thy Subiect, be thy Soveraigne? Wilt loose thy roiall sole prerogatiue, To make vngrateful base Bash rags to thriue? O be indulgent to thine owne deere Hart, And of Heav'ns blessings take a blisful part. Doe not depriue thy selfe of that rare blisse, That vnto none but thee peculier is. And here vpon the sodaine (great mishap) I found my selfe in Oxford my loues lap. Where thinking seriously vpon this thing, I heard some say, God saue king Iames, our King. And therewithal I heard a Trumpets clang, That in an vnison that Dittie sang. Then did I more admire what I had seene, But griev'd I had so double lost the Queene! And grieu'd no lesse, sith I saw not the rest Of that wherein I held me highlie blest! Had I so blessed bin, t'haue seene th'event, I should haue thought my time divinely spent. But as I cannot now diuine vvhat shal Vnto this Land (orewhelm'd in blisse) befal; So wil I not suspect the worst; for why? God, onely good, keepes good Kings company. John Davies. To the Right Ho. and most most Reverend Father in God my Lord Archb. of Canterb. his grace. Thou temp'rate Soule, that holdst promotion To be but Vertues meede; and vertuouslie Dost higher prize the Soules devotion Proceeding from the low'st humilitie: Passion-suppressing wel-disposed spirit, Cleere glasse wherein true Pastors may behold The hall'wed life that heaven doth inherit, Whose praises Glorie writes in liquid gold. O helpeful, harmelesse, vertuous virgin-Priest! O louing tender-harted gaullesse Doue! O that Arte could in thy praise so insist As answere might the measure of my loue! But for my loue herein surmounts my skill, Accept this poore show of my rich good-will. I. D. To the most gracious Prince the Duke of Lennox, &amp;c. For no respect (great Lord) but for the loue I owe to grace and greatnesse ioin'd in one, Doth my weake Pen her strongest vertue proue To graue thy name vpon this paper-stone; That if it chance the turnes of Time to brooke, (Which grinde to pouder all produc'd in Time) Thy Name at least (which is my most) may looke Like to it selfe, in my hard-fauour'd Rime. If voice of those that loue the voice diuine Bee true (the truth whereof none ought to doubt) Thou like the Moone, among heav'ns l?ps dost shine, While Sol thy Sov'raigne goes the Globe about. Long maist thou (as he doth) giue light to all That pleas'd, or pain'd, doe foote this earthy Ball. I. D. To the R. Honorable, and highly valued Lord the Earle of Northumberland. &amp;c. Who cannot raigne in height of lofty stile, That hath so high a subiect for the same As thy heroicke worth and glorious name, Is abiect, nay, then abiect farre more vile. Magnificke thoughts to think on, thoughts doth mo?t Aboue the spheare of common intellect; The thought of thy thoughts causeth this effect, Which maks my towring thoughts th?selus surmo?t. I thinke of thee and them, as of those things That moue to rest in honors highest Spheare, Sith vertue is the scale the same to reare, Which wil make thee as neere, as deere to kings: As long (great Lord) as Vertue guideth thee, Thou shalt be blest of God, King, State, and me. I. D. To the Right Honorable the Earle of VVorcester, &amp;c. Wert thou (most noble Lord) a scurge to me Plagueing my misses vvith an Iron Rod, Yet vvould I, in my hart, still honor thee; For, though he punish me; I honor God. Thou dost hurt no man simplie for his harme, But as the Surgeon doth, his hurt to heale; Would wounded, or diseased states did swarme With no worse Surgeons for their Common-weale! I honor thee for that vvhich God himselfe Doth honor Men; that is, for drawing neere To his great goodnesse (not for Port, or Pelfe) I honor thee for that, deere Lord; and deere Shal such be to me for their vertue sake, Though I thereof no vse at all doe make. I. D. To the Right right Honorable the Earle, and Countesse of Rutland. For infinite respectes to thee (sweete Lord) My Muse doth consecrate these zealous lines; Which is the All her nothing can afford, Serving for nothing but for true loues signes. To thee that do'st enioy fruite of his loines From whose worsts parts proceeded nought but good; (Whose weakest vvorths, brake Envies strongest foines) These lines I send; and to his deerest blood. Sweete couple that haue tasted sweete and sowre, The sweetest potion worldly weale can taste; O let each others sweetes that gaull devoure Which with this sowre VVorlds sweetes is interlac't: And that you may doe so, your vnknowne yours, Will praie, so you vouchsafe to call him ours. I. D. To the Right Honorable Earle of Cumberland. Neptunes vice-gerent, Sea-controling Spirit That makes her pay thee tribute, and thy land; Of which thou dost, therefore, great honor merit, And worthy art thou on both to command. So long thou hast the Northern-pole regarded, That nature now, hath made that pole thine head: So, lookes are, with what was lookt for, rewarded; Then by his light, let thy course still be led. If so, thy fame the world inviron shall, For, his light leades to glory infinite; Then eie him well and his staid motions all, Yea, draw as neere him as is requisite: So, Fame thy name will on the Skies enrole. So shalt thou honor'd be by this North-Pole. I. D. To the Right Noble and intirely beloved Earle of Southamton. &amp;c. Welcome to shore vnhappy-Happie Lord From the deepe Seas of danger and distresse; Where, like thou wast to be throwne over boord In every storme of discontentednesse. O living Death, to die when others please! O dying Life to live how others will! Such was thy case (deere Lord) such al thine ease; O Hell on Earth; can Hell more vex the VVill! This Hell being harrowed by his substitute That harrowed Hell, thou art brought forth fr? th?ce, Into an Earthly Heaven absolute, To tast his sweetenesse, see his excellence. Thy Liege well wotts, true Loue that soule must wo?d, To whom Heav'ns grace, &amp; His, doth so abound. I. D. To the Right Noble, and no lesse learned then iudicious Lord, VVilliam Earle of Pembrooke. &amp;c. Deere Lord, if so I could, I would make knowne How much I longe to keep thee still alive; These Lines (though short) so l?g shalbe thine owne As they have pow'r Vitality to giue: I consecrate this Myte of my devotion To the rich Treasurie of thy deere fame; Which shal serve (though nought else worth) as a Notion For Tyme to sever thy fame from thy name: William, Sons Son of VVilliam dreaded Earle Of Pembrooke; made by Englands H. 8. dreadful'st King: Nephue to Sidney (rare VVorths richest Pearle) That to this Land her fairest fame did bring: These VVorthies worthes are treasured in thee, So three in one, makes one as deere as three. I. D. To the same. VVithin my Soule I sensiblie doe feele A moti?, which my Minds att?tion markes; That is, to strike Loues Flint against Truthes Steele More hard, to kindle thy loue by the Sparkes: But if the fire come not so freely foorth As may in flame the Tinder of thy loue, The tender of my Zeale shalbe hencefoorth Offred in flames, that to thy grace shal move: Which is their Spheare where they desire to rest, And resting there they wil in glorie shine; I am thine owne by double interrest Sith once I vow'd my selfe to thee and thine, O then had I but single loue of you, I should bee double bound to VV. Your Honors peculier Iohn Dauies. To the Right Honorable and highly renowmed Lady the Countesse of Pembrooke, the Vertuous Lady, Lady Anne her daughter, and the Right Worthie and Worshipfull Phillipp Herbert Esquier her Sonne. Thus must poore Debters pay their Creditors, And share a little, where the due is more; I owe my selfe to you, great Favorers, And I am little; so are great Ones, poore: I owe my selfe vnto my selfe; and so Doe I to those whom as my selfe I loue; I owe you more; the three in One belowe, Which I haue honor'd most next That aboue: If more, what more? sith that's more th? I haue (for I am not so much mine owne, as yours;) More by as much as what I else might crave I wish it mine for you; for, in your powres All that and more, (if more could be possest) Should, while you held me yours, yours firmly rest. I. D. To the Right Honorable the Earle of Mar. &amp;c. Loe, how my Muse (inflamed by desire To winne thy loue in paying thee thine owne) Doth striue with VVitts dull sword, and loves quicke fire, To honor thee; but how? that is vnknowne. And if vnknowne to me, then needs it must, To All to whom my Thoughts are lesse reveal'd; In me it's like an Embrio, or like Dust, Wherein the first Man laie, at first conceal'd: I am devising how to fash'on it, God grant I spoile it not in hammering; And if I doe, Ile sacrifize my VVitt In fire of Zeale, the while my Muse doth sing, Like to the Swanne when death the songe ensu'th, Most blest to die with sweete Mar in her Mouth. I. D. To the Right Honorable and Loiall-harted Lord the Earle of Clanricard. Ovr English Crownes approued Irish frend, That raign'st in our true loue for such thy truth, Let thine owne rare perfections thee c?m?d, For, perfect praise, perfection still ensu'th. I never was so happie as to see thee, Much lesse to knowe thee, whom I longe to see: But, in thy predecessor did fore-see thee; For, if Fame fable not, much like you bee. To add then to thy glory more bright beames, Loue His, thy other-selfe, with deerest loue; For shee hath martir'd bin with greefes extreames, Deere Innocent, whose vertues all approue. Her loue to thee doth argue thy hie vvorth Then loue such loue, that setts thy glory forth. I. D. To the Right Honorable and no lesse vertuous Lady the Countesse of Clanricard. Honor attend, as vertue guides thy life, Deere Lady, lou'd of all that are belov'd, As it hath done thee, virgin, VViddowe, VVife, For which thou wert of all, in all, approu'd. By Heav'n assign'd to Natures Miracles, Mirrors of Manhood, and Heroick partes; VVorld, Flesh, &amp; Fiends, to such are obstacles, But God, Saints, Angels guerd? their deserts. In thee it is, the loue of such t'alure, And binde them to thee with loves Gordian knott; It is thy grace and reputation pure That made these worthies fall so to thy Lott: God give thee ioy of this, for in the rest Thou seemd'st accurst, because so highly blest. I. D. To the most heroick, &amp; meritoriously renowmed Lord, the Lord Mount ioy, Lord Deputy of Ireland. To praise thee (noble Lord) were but to doo What all the world doth; and to doo the same, Were to offend, and that extreamly too; And al extreame offence incurrs defame. Praise is not seemely in a wicked mouth; The VVorld is wicked, and her mouth is worse, Ful of detraction, false-praise, and vntruth; Then, should I praise according to her course? O no! thy vertue merits more regard; Let Vertue praise thee, as thou her dost praise; For, sacred vertue is her owne reward, And Crowns her selfe, in spight of Fortunes Nayes: She is thy guide, and Glory her attends, VVhich, her in thee; and thee in her commends. The true lover of your honor &amp; vertue I. D. To the Right honorably honored and right wel-beloved yonge Earle of Essex &amp;c. Deere offspring of that all-belooued One, Deere vnto all, to whom that one was deere; The Orphanes God requites thy cause of mone By Him, that doth to all like God appeere. Al those that loue you (al-beloued Two) Will blesse and loue him for it; blest of God To comfort Innocents, and Orphanes too, That ruin'd were by fell Disasters Rod. Liue like His Sonne, that liv'd too like him selfe; And dide like one, deere to Him without like; He wrackt his fortunes on false Favors shelfe, Which are this worlds; that smiles wh? it doth strike. And, that thou mai'st thy country glorifie No lesse then hee, all pray; then needes must I. I. D. To the R. Honorable S?. Iohn Popham Knight Lord chiefe-Iustice of England, &amp;c. Ivstly seveare, seveare in Mercies cause, Sith it is mercie, mercie-wanting men To cut of with the razor of the lawes, That wounds the wounders of their brethren. To thee (graue Cato) are these lines adrest, As proofes of what respect they beare thy fame; Which, with these VVorthies, shalbe here imprest By my best Pen, in Honor of thy name. If best deseruers of the publike weale Should not be memorized of the Muse, Shee should her proper vertue so conceale, And so conceal'd, should that and them abuse: To free her then, and thee, from so great wrong, Liue lines with Pophams earned praises long. I. D. To the R. Honorable and most learned Lord, the Lord Henry Haward, &amp;c. What hope the noble, vertuous, and the learn'd May haue, they having now so rare a King, In thee learn'd, vertuous, noble Lord's discern'd, In whom these flourisht without cherrishing. Where vertue raignes, her subiects shal beare rule, The learn'd, and vertuous, shee wil haue to sway: For vice wel-learned, is but arm'd Misrule, By whom the vertuous stil are made awaie. Honors doe alter manners in those men That are to honor and good manner foes; In thee that is not to be feared then, For each with thee, from thy conception groes. And sith Apollo now doth water them They wil grow great togither with the stemme. I. D. To the Right Noble, Robert Lord Sidney Baron of Penshurst. &amp;c. Thy vertue, and the conscience of the grace Thou hast vouchsau'd me, not deserving it, Doth like two spurres provoke my will and wit, Thy name with my loues lines to interlace. Thy honor'd name, name honored of all That honors grace by man made glorious, Can of it selfe rowze vp the dullest Muse To make thereof divine memoriall. Then, should lit commende to Monument, No miracle should I perfourme thereby, Sith it by Nature liues eternally, Such life to Sidneys being incident. And sith divine S? Philip liues in thee, Be thou that Monument; and so ease me. I. D. To the Right Honorable the Lord Home, &amp;c. The place, m? say, thou holdst, (great Lord) in court Leicester, Essex, Worcest.Was held before by three Superlatiues; Most wise, most lov'd, most lowly in high port; The place, I weene, hath such prerogatiues. Then, were thy vertue not in that degree, The vertue of the place would it reiect; But its a powrefull argument to mee, That thou art vertuous (Lord) in each respect. The rather, sith thy Liege that plac'd thee there, Doth heaue vp none so high, but for high worth; Whose Iudgements eie is admirable cleere, Which warrants me to put thy praises forth: My coulors ready are, I lacke but light (Which I will haue) to paint them out aright. I. D. To the Right Honorable, the good Lord of Kinlosse, &amp;c. Praise that proceedeth from a Poets Pen, That faines by nature, may want powre perch?ce To adde renowne to the renownes of Men, Whom goodnesse without glozing doth advance. If then my Pen (though it too open be To gloze) disabled be by Envies spight To register the right that's due to thee, Yet should it wrong thee to conceale thy right. Thy VVorld-cont?ning Thoughts the world do make (As knowledging the ods twixt good and Ill) To rev'rence thee for thy rare goodnesse sake, Which harts with loue, &amp; mouthes with praise doth fill: They stile that praise but with one only word Which being, Good, with God doth still accord. I. D. To the Right Noble Lady, the Lady Rich. To descant on thy name as many doe (Sith it is fit t'expresse thine excellence) I should (deere Lady) but allude vnto That, vvhich with it compar'd, is indigence. Yet to bee rich was to bee Fortunate, As all esteem'd, and yet though so thou art, Thou wast much more then most vnfortunate, Though richly-well thou plaid'st That haplesse part Thou didst expresse what Art could never sho, The Soules true griefe for losse of her Loues soule; Thine Action speaking-passion made, but ô! It made thee subiect to a Iailes controule. But, such a Iaile-bird heauenly Nightingale, For such a cause, sings best in greatest bale. I. D. To the intire Body of the Kinges Maiesties most Honorable Privie Councell. Where Loue devided is, shee hardly can Be like her selfe; But, when shee is intire, In sacred flames shee burnes more hot then fire, Bee it in abstract Formes; or mortall Man. Yet Loue, and reverence are due to those Whose, wakefull wits still worke for publike good; So rev'rence I your honor'd Fatherhood, As Founts from whom our publike proffit floes. In you wise Pilots of this ioy-fraught Barke (Barke of our blessed Common-weale) it is To make her keepe her course in lasting blisse, Which charge requires your well-directing carke: You cannot better spend lifes benefit Then for so good an ende, at Sterne to sit. I. D. To my much honored, and intirely beloued Patronesse, the most famous Vniversitie of Oxford. To mount aboue Ingratitude (base crime) With double lines of single-twisted Rime; I will (though needlesse) blaze the Sun-bright praise Of Oxford, where I spend some gaining daies: Who entertaines me with that kinde regard, That my best words, her worst deedes should reward: For like a Lady full of roialtie, Shee giues me Crownes for my Charactery: Her Pupils crowne me for directing them, Where like a King I liue, without a Realme: They praise my precepts, &amp; my Less?s learne, So doth the worse the better wel governe. But Oxford, ô I praise thy situation Passing Pernassus, Muses habitation! Thy Bough-deckt-dainty VValkes, with Brooks beset Fretty, like Christall Knots, in mould of Iet. Thy sable Soile's like Guians golden Ore, And gold it yeelds, manur'd; no mould can more. The pleasant Plot where thou hast footing found, For all it yeelds, is yelke of English ground. Thy stately Colledges like Princes courtes, Whose gold-embossed high-embattl'd Ports With all the glorious workmanshippe within Make Strangers deeme they haue in Heaven bin, When out they come from those celestiall places, Amazing them with glorie and with graces. But, in a word to say how I like thee, For place, for grace, and for sweete companee, Oxford is Heav'n, if Heav'n on Earth there be. John Davies. To the most Honorable and Valorous Knight Sir Thomas Erskin &amp;c. Hony of Hybla if my Pen could dropp Nay Nectar subtilized to the Spright, Were not too sweet to varnish Vertues Propp That holpe t'vphold our staie in Treasons spight. Gainst Traitors did thy trustinesse appeere, VVho were the Foiles to make thy Truth to shine, How blest wert thou that did'st thee so besteere As made Treas'n pay, for her demaund Death the fine of al flesh a Fine? How art thou bound to Opportunity That put her Fore-locks freelie in thy Fist? And how ought we to praise thy valiancy Where through, and through our Kinges, we all are blist! One hardie Hand ioyn'd to a valiant Kinges A Tribe of Traitors to confusion bringes! I. D. To the thrice Noble and valorous Knight Sir Edward VVingfield. To thee Belonas choisest Champion Whose woundes, if steept in dew of Castalie, (As they deserve) would make thee such an one As Pagans vs'd for God to glorifie. How oft hast thou thy selfe to wo?ds expos'd To let in glory through thy gored sides! That through thy flesh it might be so dispos'd As in each part thereof it now abides? How prodigall hast thou bin of thy bloud? No more is left th? meerely life maintaines: The fatt Calfe must be kill'd to do thee good Thy hart to comforrt, and to fill thy Vaines. O tis a glorious prodigalitie That spends what not? for God &amp; Conterie! I. D. To the Noble, discreete, and wellbeloved Knight Sir Henry Nevill. There was a Time when, ah that so there was, Whie not there is? There is and was a Time, Wh? Men might cal Gold, Gold; &amp; Brasse, but Brasse, And saie it, without check, in Prose or Rime. Yet should I cal thee Gold, some (Brasse perchance) VVould saie! err'd because I nere toucht thee, And so did cal thee through meere ignorance, Or (which is worse) through abiect Flatteree. I am too ignorant (I doe confesse) To iudge thy woorth, which worthiest Men c?mend, Yet may I say (I hope) and not transgresse, Th'art Vertue, Valour, Truth, and Honors friend; All which presume thou art not gilt by guile Because thy noble name Ne-vile. denies the vile. I. D. To the Right VVorshipfull and most worthy Knight Sir Edward Dyer. Though Saturne now with Iupiter doth sitt, Where earst Minerua &amp; the Muse did raigne, Ruling the Common-wealth of vvill, and vvitt, Plac'd in the kingdomes of thy hart, and braine: Those Planetts I adore, whose influence Infuseth vvisedome, Counsell, gravity; Minerua &amp; the Muse ioyes my Soules sence, Sith Soule-delighting lines they multiplie. In both respects, for that that was and is I tender thee the service of my Muse, Which shal not marre thy fame though it may misse To give the same that which to it accrues; Yet this Gift, through thy Gifts, she gives to thee: Times future, Dyer, die shal never see. I. D. To the right worshipfull &amp; venerable Prelate, Doctor Tompson Deane of VVindsor. My frend, my father, naie, which is more deere, My selfe should I, ere thee, (belov'd) forgett, VVhose loue to mee, to mee doth thee indeere, Whose C?versation life my will for like on edge doth sett: In the vvombe fashiond for a right Divine, Pleasing to God, to Angells, and to Men; In whose face vvitt, and pietie doth shine, To leade the blinde, drawe perverse Bretheren. An hart of flesh, clos'd in a Brest of Brasse, To feele Mens paines, and paine endure to ease th?; Charities Mirror, or thick christal glasse, Wher-through God: S?-beams burne what doth disease th?. Good to the good and badd, to great and small, And my good freind, though I be worst of all. I. D. Memories tribute due to the most worthie and no lesse learned Gentleman, Edward Herbert of Mountgomeroy Esquier. Can I forgett that's aie myne Eyes before? If so I could, I may not thee forgett, That vow'd my Memorie to thee of yore, Then, thou of me maist claime that as thy Debt. There are in thee partes worth my memorie, Although it could thy partes immortal make: Who knowes thee wil my iudgement iustify, If not, he doth both thee and mee mistake. I cannot iudge of coulors, with such Eyes As cannot be deceaved; but I can Discerne the knowne foole, from th'approved wise, And without Spectacles, a Beast fr? Man: If then (sweete Sir) shouldst thou but please the sense, Sense must needs praise thy pleasing excellence. He in whose Memorie you shall live, till you saile to be what you are, or it what it is. I. D. To all the right noble Nobilitie of England. If I were not disabled, through Defect, (For my Inventions Poise, which witt vp-wound, Lies now, for want of str?gth, stock-still on ground) No vertuous Peere I would, by name, neglect. The VVheeles which did my Fancy (working) turne Are at a stand; O then impute it not To want of VVill, as if I had forgott In wilfull wise, to name you in your turne. But wh? my VVitts haue strength recovered To winde the Poise vp to Inventions height, Ile doo my best to give each one his right, Though by your selves you are most honored. Meane while with Favors Eye looke on my VVill Which may excuse my present want of skill. I. D. To all the right Honorable Earles &amp; Lords of Scotland. I want no loue, how ere my skill may faile, In Honors Catalogue your names to putt, Yet now am forc'd th? (al vnseene) to shutt In these straite Lines, as in the Muses Iaile. Where Ile detaine th? (not without your leaue) Till I doe set them foorth with better grace, Each one in his true Coulors, forme, and place, And as I found them faire, so them to leave. When you awhile before my Muse have sate, (For Painters make th? sitt, whose formes they paint) Her skill shall faile, but then shee will depaint According to the Life, your life, and State: Pictures are vs'd, life, after death to sho, And youres, my Pen must picture, shalbe so. I. D. To the most faire, most fortunate, and no lesse famous Magdalen Colledge in Oxford. And can I seeme, much lesse then can I be Grateful, if I should thee, or thine forget, Whose Head, and Members bind me so to thee, That thou maist giue or take me as thy debt? Thy discreete head's a Bond that bindes my head, My hart, my hand, and vvhat besides is mine To him for thee, to thee for him, in Deede; So being bound in Deede, in deede am thine. The Members of thy body (not of stone Squar'd by the cunning of a mortall hand, But living, loving, made by Loue alone) Haue by their loue, in ever-lasting Band So tide me to them, that as they doe moue, So moue I, forc'd by force of mutuall loue. Againe. Blest be that Thought, past time beyond al thought, That first did moue that wise, as holy William Wainflet Bishop of Winchester. hart, To reare this Trophey where his vertues fought And c?quer'd Rage, with wh? those Hen. 6. Ed. 4. times took part: A sacred Trophey left for Vertues vse, Not onely (as are others) for meere fame; But as a nere-dri'd Dugge vnto the Muse, That times, past time, might suck sweets fr? the same. Sing sweetly (blessed Babes, that sucke the Brest Of this sweete Nectar-dropping Magdalen) Their praise in holy Hymnes, by whom yee Feast, The God of Gods, and VVaineflet best of Men: Sing in an Vnion with the Angels Quires, Sith Heav'ns, your house c?tenting your desires. I. D. To the VVorld. Perhaps in Iudgements eie it may appeare I lou'd Him living whom I honor dead; Whose loue, I think, to all was no lesse deare, Sith hee was such as all men honored. All? that is, some, or rather most of All; If some did not, the harme I wish to them Is, that they may deserue loue generall, Or els made free of new Ierusalem. No creature bearing God-almighties forme, But I desire to loue, and wish him vvell; If good desires, farre worse Affects deforme, It comes from that for which the first M?fel: But howsoere, I am resolv'd herein, To wish al grace, in spight of flesh &amp; sinne. I. D. To my beloved M?. Iohn Davies of the Middle-Temple Councellor at the Law. Why should it not content me, sith thy praise Pertaines to me, to wh? thy name pertaines; If thou by Art to heav'n thy fame canst raise? Al's but Iohn Davies that such glory gaines; Admit it liues enrol'd in lasting lines In the Exchequer of the sacred Muse, Thy name, thy fame vnto my name c?bines In future times, nor Thou nor I can choose. For, if Iohn Davies such, such times brought forth, To wit, these times in vvhich vve both doe liue, Then must Iohn Davies, share Iohn Davies worth, For, times to come can no distinction giue. Then what neede I to beate my tired braines To make Iohn Davies liue to after Ages, When thou hast don't by thy praise-worthy paines, For, were I idle, I haue thy VVorkes wages. Or, what if like an intellectual Sprite, I able were Artes Spirits to purifie, To ravish VVorlds to come with rare delight They would with my fame thy name glorifie. Then may I play sith thou dost worke for me; And sith thy works do so in beauty shine, What neede I then for Eccle. 2. 15. fame thus busie be, Sith thine is mine, and mine is likewise thine? It is because my Minde that's aie in motion Hath to the Muses Measures most devotion. Againe Iohn vnto Iohn, Davies to Davies sends This little draught of new loues large Demise, If wordes doe want to passe what it pretends, Supplie that want the Grant neede no supplies. To you and to your Heires, the same doth runne, Simplie in loue for aie to hold in fee, A good estate, you haue, and your Sonnes Sonne; A kinde acceptance shall your out-rent be: You Co?cel can your selfe, a fee then saue, Mende you the draught, loues Deede no fault should haue. The Booke of it selfe. I am, that was not; and I was, that am; I was vnmade; that was, in state confus'd: I am, for Arte hath form'd that formlesse Frame, Yet form'd my nature was, ere Arte was vs'd. Mother-Tongue, and VVit, Observance, &amp; goodwil Haue made me what I am, or good, or ill. Not vnto vs (ô Lord) not vnto vs, but to thy name giue the praise and glory. Psal. 115. 1. Againe: to Envie and Detraction Deere Envie and Detracti?, deere to those That vnto Vertue are immortall foes, Let me, although I hate you, yet entreate That I, if good ynough, may be your meate; You cannot grace me more, then gnaw me still; For what you spare is too farre spent in ill. Teare me in peeces with your grizlie fangs, You Crowne my Soule with glory by such Pangs. Hee is a Divell that to die detests In Hel-hounds mouthes, to live in Angells Brests. Iohn Davies. FINIS. In loue and affection of Master Iohn Davies, mine approved good friend, and admiration of his excellence in the Arte of VVriting. That heavenly Sparke, from which th'immotall Soule Had her first being, striveth to enroule Her wondrous Guifts in characters of Brasse, That when (dissolved from this earthie Masse) Shee mounts aloft, her never-dying Glorie May fill the Volumes of a learned Storie; VVhich after-Ages, reading, may admire, And (inly burning with the like desire) To rare Atcheiuements (emulous of Fame Striving t'immortalize their dying Name) May bend their Practise, dedicate their Daies; And, so excited, purchase datelesse Praise. Our actiue Soule feeles never wearinesse, But her true loue to Fame doth best expresse In hating Idlenesse: whence comes this notion, Her working Faculties are still in motion. Ore some then others, greater Soveraigntie This divine Essence of Humanitie Hath power to exercise: For baser Swaines Abhor the check of her immortall Raignes. Fr? whence it is, that Midas brood possesse The greater Share in earthly Happinesse; VVhile those pure Mindes, who most submissiue stand At the least wrentch of her almighty Hand (Obscurely hidd in Corners at their Booke) Are hardly grace't so much as with a looke Of this iniurious World. O wretched Age VVherein the sacred Artes to Vassalage Subiected are! while muddy Mindes aspire, VVhile greater Heroes daine but to admire And praise (with bootlesse breath) the polisht Lines, VVherin, C?ceipt hath traveld through the Mines Of rich Invention, manie a wearie hower (Spent with the Muses in a gloomie Bower) To times swift feathers imping greater store, VVhilst thus they plough the barrain fruictles Shore Earths brightest Angels, these, ô these be they VVhose Corps are fram'd of fire, and not of clay! VVhose either Part, both mortall, and divine So sweete a Symphonie doth intertwine, That both accord to prosequute that Fame VVhich, but for Vertue, stellifies our Name. Among which Number (famous by Desart) The Lawrel Crowne be his, whose every Part To th'intellectiue Soule (their Soveraigne) Pay true Subiectiue Dutie, and doe gaine By restlesse labour that perfection Which, saue by him, hath bin attain'd by none; By him (the Subiect of these worthles Rimes) Whose Art lends luster to our English climes, Davies, discoverer of hidden Deepes, True Microcosme, whose peircing Spirit creeps Into the darkest Cavernes, in-most Denne Where Wit inhabits mong the sons of Men, And plucks out Knowledg (by the gold?locks) From where shee long had slept within the Rocks Of hard Obscurity, whence every Eie May iudge it selfe; ô wondrous Mysterie! Whence we our selues, our selues may truly know, Which is indeede most hard, how ere in show. But endlesse were it, and impossible (Vnlesse my Muse to his were sutable) Here to delate that Grace in Poesie VVhich his witt-fraughted workes can testifie. Cast backe thine Eie, reade, and (admiring) see The Quintessence of humane Ingenie, VVay well the rich Conceipt; so shalt thou know That few, (if any) could haue written so. Descend we then from that internall Flame, To Qualities externall: whence the name Of Excellence hath purchast beene of manie, But, as of Davies, never yet of anie. In praising whom, the best my Lines can say VVill, for his VVorth, be worthlesse every way: Yet, for I loue his Name, admire his Skill, Out of the heate and fervour of Good-will These colder Lines this frozen passage found, Force't by the League wherin al Frendes are bound: And reason tis, those Men that merit Fame Aboue the rest, should franckly haue the same. And be it farr from every gentle Hart To deeme that, Soothing, or a glosing part VVhen one good Freind an other shal commend More then that, Hatred, when our speeches tend In whom we loue, some fault to rectifie VVhich wrongs himselfe, defames his Progenie. Praise is the guerdon of a due Desart Making vs better act the praised Part. There never Man deserved Memorie For perfect Science in his Facultie, If Dauies Name deserue to be forgott, If, when his mortall Part in earth shall rott, The riches of his Soule (mans greatest treasure) Shalbe made subiect to the greedie seasure Of darke Obliuion, if such Perfection Shall fr? the Graves rude hand haue no protection. Maugre the Gripe of Time, in spight of Fates And ought beside that, Fame, determinates, His Name would liue to all Posteritie In the fayre lines of his Characterie, Could any Hand the A steele Instrument. graver so commaund, As can, the penne, his vvonder-writing Hand. But, for no Graver, or stampt Letter can (Or ought els framed by the Witt of Man) Shew Times future true proose of such rare Skill By demonstration, mine Artlesse Quill Striues to commende to lasting Memorie A glimps (though darkely) of that Qualitie. For (if mine aime Loue hath not much betraid) This Booke must liue till Time his course hath staid: So that, to those not yet conceiv'd, I send This poore effect which my loues cause hath pend, Neglecting Art, affecting to descrie Loue to my friend, and to his Qualitie. Whose Matchlesse Art in managing the Penne Time neuer equaliz'd; and Times agen (When his diurnal Howërglasse hath ranne The dated Minutes of a mortall Man) Will hardly paralel: for such true Skill May scarce be purchased by paine, or Will: Hee that as Davies would as fairely vvrite, Must of necessitie haue Davies spright. Who knows not that this wondrous Facultie Is not conceiu'd by coorse Capacitie, But maketh there her only Habitation Where shee doth finde a strong Imagination! For none habitually can her possesse That is not made of fire and liuelynesse. Could neuer Hand so curiously convay The nice Delineaments, so every vvay In iust proportion (purest Sumetrie) Vnlesse directed by a perfect Eie, And first imprinted in the Phantasie: Which, weaker Braines can never apprehend, Much lesse an Actiue Demonstration lend. The strange Meanders, and the Gordian knots Now straight, now larger, as the Hand alots; The curious VVorkemanshippe in every letter, This pleasing best, that other pleasing better, A third exceeding both, when euery one For perfect shape is singular alone; The rare Diversitie which one selfe-hand Can, with that little Instrument command, Doth so bewitch th'amaz'd Beholders eie, And so delight th'invegled Phantasie, That vvhat our eies behold our Tongues commend, Nor, wondring, can admit or meane, or end. Come lend, yee Lovers of this sacred Art, Your voice with mine, to celebrate a part In his deserued Praise, whose matchlesse Skill To blazon perfectlie, vvould tire the Quill Of Hermes selfe: for rightly to commende This Art of VVriting, vvere to comprehende Within our Numbers her Antiquitie, And, how through her, the living Memorie Of famous Worthies hath preserued beene; Whose VVorkes these latter Ages had not seene, But (rake't in Darknesse with their Authors head) VVithout her helpe, had euer perished. Nor should we slightly touch the Praises Due Which, through this Art, to Learning still accrue; Without whose aide, in vaine were Sapience, In vaine were every other Excellence; Sith Strangers might not then participate VVhat Reading, VVit, and Labour had begat, But greatest Clarks should vainely spend their daies, Leaving, with Life, their Glory, Name, and praise: Her dayly Vse, her pure Necessitie May tell the Vertue of this Mysterie; Sufficeth me, to runne (though slightly) over Part of his Parts, whose Penne can best discover Her fairest Beauty; such, as doth excite In All that view Her, wonder and delight. All Characters that ere the Graver wrought Are obvious to him, and quicklie brought To decke the Triumph of the golden Penne VVhich he long since hath merited: for when (T'approue his Excellence) he challeng'd All Or English bred, or forraine Nationall To striue for glorie, and a golden Price (Which one or both might every sort entise) Vnanswered, hee Monarchiz'd alone; What greater Conquest than withstood by None? The Germanes, skill'd in every curious Art (VVhose practick Hand doth to the World impart Such quaint Devises) giving Right his due, Extoll our Davies, and his Fame pursue With printed lines, writ in the Latine tongue, As loth to doe his Cunning so much wrong In the distastiue Germane Idiom To leaue that Monument for Times to come, Because they knew their Dialect too lame To beare the vvaight of his immortall fame. O you thrise famoused for Raritie, The grace and beautie of yont Faire writing. Qualitie, That breathe the Aire of Italie, and France, Come, doe your Homage and Allegiance To him whose Pen raignes in faire Paper Reames, (Content therewith as Kinges with Diadems) VVhose Subiects Letters are of every Suite Made all aright by rule most absolute. To him, from Paris, moue thine antique station Beauchene, the perfectst Pen-man of thy Nation; To him, from Venice, bring those Guifts of thine, Renoun'd for wondrous writing, Camerine; VVarne thou the Romanes that thou must be gone To visite England, curious Curion; Come all at once, that all at once may learne To mend your Hands, and rightly to discerne Betweene the Good, and most most-Excellent; Nor will (perhapps) your Travaile be mispent, Sith each, in's Natiue Hand, may gaine perfection By practising His Counsell and Direction. In former Times, ere wiser Times begatt (That which for ever Men shall wonder at) The Printing Mysterie, that curious Hand VVhich could the Pen most perfectly commaund Had not a Finger vnbegirt with Gold, Such meede had Merit in the daies of old: Had Dauies liu'd, when such Preheminence VVas onely given to Men of exellence, The scribling VVriters of that golden Time Had (w?dring) sought some more auspicious Clime; For none, save He alone, had thriv'd in this, The guift of Exellence beeing onely his. To him, from Heaven, descends this Quality: For, VVill, Desire, all-gaining Industrie, Time, Promptitude, VVitt, Steadinesse of Hand, Swift apprehension, Fingers at command, Strongest Conceipt, Art Geometricall, Or ought attain'd by Science naturall, Poetick Furie, and the Muses ayd, (All which are Propps whereon this Art is stayd) Nor these, nor other Adiuments haue power To purchase that (with manie a toyling hower) VVhich from aboue, by pure Instinct was sent To grace our Dauies, Englands For writing. Wonderment. In whose deserved Praise, if ardent Zeale (Striving my neere Affection to reveale) Hath larger beene then well becomes the Place, This short Apologie may purchase Grace; In Vertues praise can nere bee said too much; Such is our Subiect, his Demeanour such.
