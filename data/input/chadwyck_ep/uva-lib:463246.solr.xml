Blundeston. The Senses dull of my appalled muse Foreweryed with the trauayle of my brayne In scannyng of the argued Bookes difuse, And darke for me the glimeryng syght to gayne, Debated long what excersyce to use, To fyle the edgeles partes of Wyl agayne To clense the Heade from sleapy humours slyme. To rouse the Hart from drowsye Dreames ? time The mind desyres to brek fr? thoughtful denne And tune requyres the painted felds to vewe. The Eye procures to please the Fancie then With fieldish sights of diuers colours newe. The smelling likes the fauour swete of them. The Eare agrees the pleasaunt laye anewe Of Byrds to here. Thus these do all contryue, With this disporte the Spirits to reuyue. But Fancie then, by serche of selfe deuyse, Renouncyng thus to spende the pleasaunt Maye So vainly out with sport of fruteles Pryce Found out at length, this practyse for thy playe, To penne in Uerse, the toyes of her deuise, To pas this tyme of Pentecoste awaye Whose ydle dayes the wyld me thus to spende And publish forth her doings in the ende. Quod Reason no, (and brake her tale begon, Wilt thou presume, lyke Bayarde blynd to presse, Into the throng, of all the lookers on Whose vewyng eyes, will wey thy wisdom lesse. To se the threde of all thy workes yll spon Drawen out at length, vnto the comon gesse, Then if thou shuldst kepe to thy selfe thy ciewe Where none thy works besydes thy self may vew With this rose vp, from out her Seate behynde, Dame Memorye, and Reason thus besought. Since Lady chiefe of vs thou art assygnde To rule and temper all my secrete thought And to restrane affections Fancie blynde, Let me entreate if I may perce the ought, For to present a Solace very fytte Our Sences dull with chaunged Muse to whet. Lo here the Eye a Paper buntche doth se Of fyled worke of Googes flowing Heade, Lefte here behynde, when hence he past from me, In all the stormes that Winter blastes bespreade Through swellyng Seas &amp; loftye mo?tains hye Of Pyrenet the pathes vnknowen to treade. Whose great good wyll I kepe, and in his place His Uerses craue to represent his face. Unfolde the trusse therfore and yf the Mule Be setted so with this graue Study past In so short space, or if we seke to chuse To prynt our actes in safetie at the last Cease of a whyle this Labor and peruse These Papers left of suche delyghting taste And put in prynt these workes of worthy Skyll So shall we showe the fruytes of our good wyll. This Fancie lykte, imagynyng aryght Of her owne Ioye in hearyng of his Uerse And pleasaunt Style, most pythyly endyght whose Fame forth blowen, his deds could wel reherse But for to paynt my name in open sight with others Stuffe, this wold she fayne reuerse, And thinkes I should in others Plumes so show My selfe, to be a seconde Elops Crowe. But after when the Eye had vewed eche Lyne. That Googe had pend and left behynde with me, when Memorye could all the effect refygne, To Reasons Skyll, to weye them as they lye. with long reherse of tryed Fayth by tyme Then Fancie soone her Pryde, began to plye And all receyued muche pleasure to the Mynde More profytts farre then Fancye had assygnde. And Fancie thus her selfe with blushyng face, Condemned by Dame Reasons dome deuyne To se thalluryng Style the cumly grace, The sappye Sence of this his passyng Ryme, So farre surmountynge her Inuention base, And hearyng of his frendlynes in syne whiche Memorye her Storehouse held full faste Allowed well theyr Iudgements at the laste. Since euerye Sence did wonted strength reune, The Blud congeld, recoursed to his place The wyts benomd brought to theyr propre quue The Hart opprest with old delighting grace, Unburdend nowe and puft with pleasure newe By takyng of this Booke the vewyng gase They all at ons Good wyll nowe calde vpon, To wrest her selfe to quyght these works adon. Thus pushte I forth strayghte to the Printers hande These Eglogs, Sonets, Epytaphes of men Unto the Readers Eyes for to be skande, with Prayses suche as is doe vnto them who absent nowe theyr Mayster maye c?mende, And feade his Fame what soeuer fayleth him, Gyue Googe therfore his owne deserued Fame, Giue Blundeston leaue to wysh wel to his name. Finis. [Eglogs.] Egloga prima Daphnes. Amintas. Syth Phebus now begins to flame, O frende Amintas deare: And placed hath his gorgeous globe in midste of all the Spheare And fr? y? place doth cast his Beames; where (they that starres defyne) Lyes poynt (doo save) that termed is, ryght Equinoctial lyne. Wheras the Ram doth cause to spring, eche herbe and floure in fyelde And forceth ground (y? spoyld of grene Did lye,) newe grene to yelde. Let shepherds vs yelde also tales, as best bec?mes the tyme: Suche tales as Winter stormes haue stayde in countrey Poets Ryme. Begyn to synge Amintas thou, for why? thy wyt is best: And many a saged sawe lies hyd within thine aged brest. Ofte haue I heard, of Shephards old, thy fame reported true, No Herdman liues: but knowes the praise, to olde Amintas due: Begyn therfore, and I gyue care, for talke doth me delyght, Go Boye: go dryue the Beasts to fede whyle he his mynde resyght. Amin. Thy prayses Daphnes are to great, and more for me than meete: Nor euer I, suche saged sawes, coulde synge in Uerses sweete. And now, to talke of spring time tales my heares to hoare, do growe Suche tales as these, I tolde in, tyme, when youthfull yeares dyd flowe. But synce, I can not the denye, thy Fathers loue doth bynde: In symple Songe I wyll adresse my selfe, to showe my mynde. Longe hast thou Daphnes me requyred the state of Loue to tell, For in my youth, I knewe the force, and passions all, full well. Nowe Loue therfore I wyll defyne and what it is declare, which way poore souls it doth entrap and howe it them doth snare. My Boie, remoue my beasts fr? hens and dryue them farther downe, Upon the Hylles, let them go feade, that ioyne to yender towne, O Cupyde kynge of fyerye Loue, ayde thou my syngynge Uerse, And teache me heare the cause &amp; case, Of Louers to reherse, Direct my tong, in trothe to treade, with Furye fyll my brayne, That I may able be to tell, the cause of Louers payne. Opinions diuers coulde I showe, but chiefest of them all, I wyll declare: and for the rest, with silence leaue I shall. A feruent Humour, (some do iudge) within the Head doth lye, Whiche yssuyng forth with poysoned beames doth ron fr? eye to eye: And taking place abrode in heads, a whyle doth fyrmely rest: Till Phrensie framde in Fancie fond discends from hed, to brest. Plato.And poison strong, fr? eies outdrawn doth perce the wretched harte, And all infectes the bloud aboute, and boyles in euery parte: Thus: wh? the beames, infected hath, the wofull Louers blud: Then Sences al, do strayght decaye, opprest with Furyes flud. Then Lybertie withdrawes herself, and Bondage beares the swaye, Affection blynd then leades the hart, and Wyt, is wownde awaye. O Daphnes then, the paines appeare, and tormentes all of hell. Then sekes, the selye wounded soule, the flames for to expell. But all to late, alas he stryues, for Fancie beares the stroke And he, must toyle (no helpe there is) in slauysshe seruyle yoke. His blud corrupted all within, doth boyle in euery vayne, Than sekes he howe to sewe for salue that maye redresse his payne. And when the face, he doth beholde by whiche he shulde haue ayde, And sees no helpe, th? lookes he long, and trembleth all afrayde. And museth at the framed shape, that hath his lyfe in handes: Nowe fast he flies, aboute the flames, nowe styll amased standes: Yet Hope relieues, his hurtful Heate and Wyll doth Payne make lyght, And al the griefes, that then he feeles doth Presence styll requyght. But when the Lyght absented is, and Beames in hart remayne, Then flames the Fyre fresh agayne, and newe begyns his Payne. Then longe he lookes, his losse to se, then sobbes, and syghes abounde, Then mourneth he, to mys the marke that erst to soone he founde. Then shadefull places oute he lookes, and all alone he lyues, Exylynge Ioye, and myrth from him, hymselfe to waylynge gyues, And styll his minde theron doth muse and styll, therof he prates, O Daphnes here I swere to the, no griefe to Louers state. Yf he but ones beholde the place, where he was wont to mete, The pleasaunt forme y? hym enflamd, and ioyfull Countnaunce swete.

But all in Blacke, he clothed came an vgly syght to se: As they that for theyr due Desartes, with Paynes tormented be, My shepe for feare amased ran, and fled from Hyll to Dale, And I alone remayned there, with countenaunce wan and pale.

The fickle fadynge forme, and face, that ones so muche I sowght, Hath made me lose the Skyes aboue, and me to Hell hath browght. Why had I Reason delt to me? and coulde not Reason vse. Why gaue I, Brydle to my wyll? when I myght well refuse. A wycked Wyll, in dede it was, that blynded so my syght, That made me on such fadyng Duste, to set my whole Delyght.

And how with flames I burnt for her, that passed nought for me, And how, these eyes encreast my harmes that fyrst her face did se, With pensyfe heart full fraight with thoughts, I fled fr? thence away, And though that Loue bad tourne my steppes, yet wold I neuer stay, But from that foule infectyue ayer, wher first I tooke my sore, I hyed in hast, and shund the place, to se for euer more. Eache letter that I had receyued from her, I cast away, And tokens all, I threw them down, to my no small dysmay. Then busyed I my selfe in thyngs that myght me moste delyght, And sought the chiefst means I could, to helpe my weryed spryght. Somtyme I wold behold the fyelds, and Hylles that thou doste se, Somtime I wold betraye the Byrds, that lyght on lymed tree, Especially in Shepstare tyme, when thicke in flocks they flye, One wold I take, and to her Leg, a lymed Lyne wold tye, And where y? flock flew thickest, there I wold her cast awaye, She strayght vnto the rest wold hye, amongst her Mates to playe. And preasyng in the mydste of them, with Lyne and Lyme, and all, With cleuyng wyngs, entangled fast they downe togyther fall. Somtyme I wold the lytel Fysh: with bayted Hooke beguyle: Somtyme the craftye Foxe I wold, deceyue for all his wyle: Somtyme the Wolfe, I wold pursue, somtyme the fomyng Boore: And whan with labour all the daye, my weryed Lyms were soore. Th? rest &amp; slepe I straightway sought no Dreames dyd me afraye: Tormented nought with care, I past the lyngryng nyght awaye. And thus I cleane forgot: in tyme, the dotyng Dayes I sawe, And freed my self, to my great Ioye, from Yoke of Louers Lawe. More of this same, I wyll the tell, the next tyme here we mete, And str?ger Medycines wyll I gyue, to purge that Uenym swete. Beholde the Daye is slypt awaye, and Starres do fast appeare, Loe where Calisto Uirgin ones, doth shyne in Skies so cleare.

If we but ones, absent our selues, the shortest tyme we maye, So muche vnconstant is your minds Loue soreth strayght awaye, Example take Sirenus here, whom once Diana lovd, As all we know, and looke how soone her mynd is now removd: No, no, there is not one of you, that constant can remayne: Siluag. You iudge but of malicious hart, and of a Ialouse brayne. All thyngs you do your selues esteme, and men must beare no blame. Of your dissemblyng noughty deeds, we women beare the shame. Siren. Fayre Damesell yf you can perceyue Siluan true doth saye There is not one amongst you all, but doth from reason straye. What is the cause that women thus? in theyr vnconstancye, Do cast a man from hyest hap, to deepest myserye? Its nothyng els, I you assure, but that you know not well, What thing is loue, &amp; what you haue, in hand you can not tell. Your symple wyts are all to weake, Unfayned loue to know, And therof doth forgetfulnes, in you so shortly grow. Seluag. Sirenus iudge not so of vs, our wyts be not so base, But that we know as well as you, whats what in euery case. And women eke, there are ynow that could yf they were brought Teache men to lyue, &amp; more to loue, yf loue myght well be tought, And for all this, yet do I thynke, no thyng can worser be. Than womens state. it is the worst, I thynke of eche degree. For yf they show but gentle words you thynke for loue they dye. And yf they speake not whan you list, than strayght you say, they are hye. And that they ar, disdainfull Dames, and yf they chaunce to talke. Th? cownt you th? for chatring Pies whose tongs must alwayes walke. And yf perhaps they do forbeare, and Sylence chaunce to keepe, Than tush, she is not for company, she is but a symple sheepe. And yf they beare good wyll to one, th? strayght they are iudged nought And yf yll name to shun they leaue, Unconstant they are thought. Who nowe can please these Ialouse heads, the faute is all in you, For women neuer wold cha?ge theyr minds yf men wold styll be true, Siren. To this, I well could answere you, but tyme doth byd me staye, And women must the last worde haue no man may say them naye. Passe ouer this, and let vs here, what lucke you haue had in loue, And showe yf euer loue of man, your constaunt hart could moue. No fytter place can be than this, here maye you safely rest, Thus syttyng here, declare at large, the secretes of your brest. Siluag. Naye: lenger here we maye not byde, but home we must awaye, Loe how the Son denies his Beames depriuyng vs of daye. Finis Egloge septime. Egloga octaua. Coridon. Cornix.

Who gyues vs pasture for our beasts and blesseth our encrease: By whom, while other cark and toyle we lyue at home with ease. Who keepes vs down, from climyng hye wher honour breeds debate, And here hath graunted vs to lyue in symple Shephards state, A lyfe that sure doth fare exceade, eche other kynd of lyfe: O happy state, that doth content, How farre be we from stryfe? Of hym therfore, me lyst to synge, and of no wanton toyes, For hym to loue, and hym to prayse, surmounts all other Ioyes. O Shephards leaue Cupidoes Camp, the ende wherof is vyle, Remoue Dame Venus from your eies and harken here a whyle. A God there is, that guyds the Globe, and framde the fyckle Spheare, And placed hath, the Starres aboue, that we do gase on here, By wh? we lyue, (vnth?kful beasts) by whom we haue our health, By whom we gayne our happy states by whom we get our wealth. A God: that sends vs that we nede, a God: that vs defends. A God: from whom the Angels hye, on mortall men attends. A God: of suche a Clemencie, that who so hym doth loue Shall here be sure to rest a whyle, and alwayes rest aboue. But we, for hym do lytell care, His Heasts we nought esteme, But hunt for thyngs that he doth hate most pleasaunt those do seme, (Unthankfull mysers) what do we? what meane we thus to straye? From suche a God, so mercyfull, to walke a worser waye? Maye nought his benefyts procure? maye nought his mercyes moue? Maye nothynge bynde, but nedes we must? gyue hate to hym for loue? O happy (ten tymes) is the man, (a Byrde full rare to fynde) That loueth God with all his hart, and kepes his lawes in mynde. He shalbe blest in all his works, and safe in euery tyme, He shall swete quietnes enioye, whyle other smarte for Cryme. The threatnyng tha?ces of the world shall neuer hym annoye, Wh? Fortune frowns on foolish men he shalbe sure to ioye. For why? the Aungels of the Lorde, shall hym defende alwayes, And set hym free, at euery harmes, and hurts at all assayes. Euen he that kept the Prophet safe, Dauid. from mouthes of Lyons wylde, And he that once preserued in Flags, Moses. the sely suckyng Chylde, Elias.The God that fed, by Rauens Byll, the Teacher of his worde, Shall hym (no doubt) in safetie kepe, from Famyn, Fyre, and Sworde.

No none of these, but God alone, ought worshyp for to haue, For they for all theyr Honour ones, rest yet in stynkyng Graue. eare hast thou heard, the happy state of them that lyue in feare, Of God: &amp; loue hym best: now lyst, his foes reward to heare, And fyrst know thou that euery man, that from this God doth goe, And folows lust, hym he acountes, to be his deadly foe, This myghty Kyng of whom we talk, as he is mercyfull, And suffers long, reuengyng slow, So when we be thus dull, That we wyl not perceaue in tyme, the goodnes of his grace, His fauour straight, he doth withdraw and tournes a way his face. And to him selfe then doth he say, How long shall I permit These stubburne beastes, for to rebell? and shall I loue them yet, That hate me thus? or haue I nede theyr louynge mynds to craue? I aske nomore but onely loue, and that I can not haue. Well, wel, I wil not care for them, that thus do me dyspyse, Let them go lyue, euen as they lyst, I turne awaye myne eyes. When God hath thus sayd to him self, Then doth the braynlesse foole, Cast Brydle of, and out he runnes, neglectynge vertues Scoole, Then doth the Deuyl geue him lyne, and let him rune at large, And Pleasure makes his Mariner, to row in vyces Barge, Then vp the Sayles of wilfulnes, he hoyses hie in hast, And fond Affection blowes hym forth, a wynd that Pluto plast, Then cuttes he swyft, the seas of sin, and through the Chanell deape, With Ioyful mynd, he fleets a pace, whom Pleasure bryngs a sleape, Then who so happy thinks hym selfe? who dreames of ioy but he? Tush, tush, sayth he: to thynk of God, In age suffiseth me, Now wil I passe my pleasaunt youth, Such toyes becomes this age, And God shall followe me sayth he, I wyll not be his page, I wyll be prowd, and looke a loft, I wyll my body decke, With costly clothes, aboue my state who then dare gyue me checke?

I wyll oppresse the symple knaue, shall Saues be sawsy now? Nay: I wyll teache the nedy Dogges, with Cappe to crowche, &amp; bow. Thus fareth he, and thus he lyues, no whyt estemyng God, In health, in ioy, and lustynes, free from the smartyng Rod, But in the midst of all his myrth, whyle he suspecteth least, His happy chaunce, begyns to cha?ge and eke his fleetynge feast, For death (that old deuouryng Wolf) whom goodmen nothyng feare, Coms saylyng fast, in Galley blacke, and whan he spyes hym neare. Doth boorde hym strayght, &amp; grapels fast and than begyns the fyght. In ryot leaps, as Captayne chiefe, and from the Maynmast ryght, He down ward comes, and surfet than, assayleth by and by, Then vyle diseases forward shoues, with paynes and gryefe therby, Lyfe stands aloft, and fyghteth hard, but pleasure all agaste. Doth leaue his ore, and out he flyes then death approcheth fast. And giues the charge so sore, y? needs must lyfe begyn to flye, Th? farewell all. The wretched man with Caryen Corse doth lye, Wh?

When Brutysh broyle, and rage of war in Clownysh harts began When Tigres stoute, in T?ners bonde vnmusled all they ran, The Noble Sheffeyld Lord by byrth and of a courage good, By clubbish h?ds, of crabbed Clowns there spent his Noble blud. His noble byrth auayled not, his honor all was vayne, Amyd the prease, of Mastye Curres, the valyant Lorde was slayne. And after suche a sorte (O ruth,) that who can teares suppresse. To thynke y?

A bluddy Butcher byg and blunt, a vyle vnweldy knaue With beastly blow of boysterous byll at hym (O Lorde) let dryue, And clefte his head, and sayd therwith shalt thou be lefte alyue? O Lorde that I had present ben, and Hectors force withall, Before that from his Carlysh hands, the cruell Byll dyd fall. Then shulde that peasaunt vyle haue felt the clap vpon his Crowne, That shuld haue dazed his dogged hart from dryuyng Lordes adowne. Then shuld my hands haue saued thy lyfe good Lord wh? deare I loued Then shuld my hart in doutfull case, full well to the ben proued, But all in vayne thy death I wayle, thy Corps in earth doth lye.

An Epytaphe of M. Shelley slayne at Musselbroughe. VVan Mars had moued mortall hate and forced fumysh heate And hye Bellona had decreed, to syt with Sworde in Seate, The Scottes vntrue with fyghtynge hande, theyr promys to denye, Assembled fast, &amp; England thought, the trothe with them to trye.

Finis. An Epytaphe of Maister Thomas Phayre. The hawtye verse, y? Maro wrote made Rome to wonder muche And meruayle none for why the Style and waightynes was suche, That all men iudged Parnassus Mownt had clefte her selfe in twayne, And brought forth one, that seemd to drop from out Mineruaes brayne. But wonder more, maye Bryttayne great wher Phayre dyd florysh late, And barreyne tong with swete accord reduced to suche estate: That Virgils verse hath greater grace in forrayne foote obtaynde, Than in his own. who whilst he lyued eche other Poets staynde. The Noble H. Hawarde once, that raught eternall fame, With mighty Style, did bryng a pece of Virgils worke in frame, And Grimaold gaue the lyke attempt, and Douglas wan the Ball, Whose famouse wyt in Scottysh ryme had made an ende of all. But all these same dyd Phayre excell, I dare presume to wryte, As muche as doth Appolloes Beames, the dymmest Starre in lyght. The enuyous fates (O pytie great,) had great disdayne to se, That vs amongst there shuld remayn so fyne a wyt as he, And in the mydst of all his toyle, dyd force hym hence to wende, And leaue a Worke vnperfyt so, that neuer man shall ende.

Beholde this fle- tyng world how al things fade Howe euery thyng doth passe and weare awaye, Eche state of lyfe, by comon course and trade, Abydes no tyme, but hath a passyng daye. For looke as lyfe, that pleasa?t Dame hath brought, Tht pelasaunt yeares, and dayes of lustynes, So Death our Foe, consumeth all to nought, Enuyeng thefe, with Darte doth vs oppresse, And that whiche is, the greatest gryfe of all, The gredye Grype, doth no estate respect, But wher he comes, he makes them down to fall, He stayes he at, the hie sharpe wytted sect. For yf that wytt, or worthy Eloquens, Or learnyng deape, coulde moue hym to forbeare, O Grimaold then, thou hadste not yet gon hence But heare hadest sene, full many an aged yeare. Ne had the Mu- ses loste so fyne a Floure, Nor had Miner- ua wept to leaue the so, If wysdome myght haue fled the fatall howre, Thou hadste not yet ben suffred for to go, A thousande doltysh Geese we myght haue sparde, A thousande wytles heads, death might haue found And taken them, for whom no man had carde, And layde them lowe, in deepe obliuious grounde, But fortune fa- uours Fooles as old men saye And lets them lyue, and take the wyse awaye.

Not to delyght, in forme of fadyng hew. Nor to be proude therof, as many be, But for to stryue, by beautie of the mynde, For to adourne, the beautie he doth se. If warlyke forme, Dame Nature hym assygnde, By vertuous lyfe, than co?tena?ce for to get, That shall deface, the fayrest of them all, Suche Beautie as no age nor yeares wyll fret: That flyes with fame, whan fyckle forme doth fayle, Thus muche I saye, that here to the present, My wordes a Glasse for the to looke vpon.

The good behauyour, of thy selfe in place Whersoeuer that thou chauncest for to lyght, So much both beautie, mynde and wyt doth grace As well can be requyred of any wyght. What resteth now? but onely God to prayse, Of whom thou hast receaued these Gyftes of thyne, So shalt thou long, lyue heare with happye dayes, And after Death, the starrye Skyes shalt clyme, Let noughtye men, saye what they lyst to the, Trade thou thy selfe, in seruyng hym about, No sweter ser- uyce can deuysed be, Whom yf thou fearst, and faythfully doste loue, Be sure no thyng, on earth shall the annoye, Be sure he wyll, the from eche harme defende, Be sure thou shalt, long tyme thy lyfe enioye, And after ma- ny yeares to haue a blessed ende.

To Alexander Neuell. The lytell Fysh, that in the streme doth fleet With brode forth stret- ched Fyns for his disporte When as he spyes, the Fysshes bayte so swete, In haste he hyes, fearynge to com to shorte, But all to soone (alas) his gredy mynde, By rash attempt, doth bryng hym to his bane, for where he thought a great relyefe to fynde, By hydden hooke, the symple fole is tane. So fareth man, that wanders here and theare, Thynkyng no hurt to happen hym therbye, He ronnes amayne, to gase on Beauties cheare, Takes all for golde that glysters in the eye, And neuer leaues to feade by lookyng long, On Beauties Bayte, where Bondage lyes enwrapt, Bondage that makes hym synge an other song, And makes hym curse the bayte that hym entrapte. Neuell to the, that louest their wanton lookes, Feade on the bayte, but yet beware the Hookes. Alexander Neuells Answere to the same. It is not cursed Cupids Dart: Nor Venus cancred Spyght, It is not vengeance of the Gods That wretched harts doth smyght, With restlesse rage of carefull Loue. No, No, thy Force alone Affection fond, doth styr these flames. Thou causest vs to mone And waile, &amp; curs our wretched stats. Our thryse vnhappy plights, Our sighes, &amp; powdred sobs w? tears, Our greuous gronyng Sprights, Thy hateful Malice doth procure: O Fancye flamyng Feend Of Hel. For thou in outwarde shape, And colour of a frende Dost by thy Snares &amp; slymed Hooks entrap the wounded Harts: From whence these Hellike torments spryng, &amp; euer greauyng Smarts. Whence Gripe of minde, w? chaunged chere Wh?ce face besmeard w? teares. Wh?ce thous?d mischiefs more, wherw? suche Mysers liues outweares. Our gasyng eyes on Bewties bayt do worke our endles bane.

Henrye Cobham of the most blessed state of Lyfe. The happyest lyfe that here we haue, My Cobham yf I shall desyne, The goodlyest state, twyrte byrth and graue, Most gracious dayes and swetest tyme. The fayrest face, of fadynge Lyfe, Race ryghtlyest ronne, in ruthfull wayes, The safest meanes to shun all stryfe: The surest Staffe, in fyckle Dayes: I take not I as some do take, To gape and gawne, for Honoures hye, But Court and Cayser to forsake, And lyue at home, full quyetlye, I well do mynde, what he once sayde, Who bad, Courte not in any case, For Uertue is, in Courtes decayed, And Uyce with States, hath chyefest place, Not Courte but Countreye I do iudge, Is it wheare lyes, the happyest lyfe, In Countreye growes, no gratynge grudge, In Countreye standes not sturdye stryfe, In Countreye, Bacchus hath no place, In Countreye Venus hath defecte, In Countreye Thraso hath no grace, In Countreye fewe of Gnatoes Secte. But these same foure and many moe, In Courte, thou shalt be sure to fynde, For they haue vowed, not thence to goe, Bycause in Courte, dwels ydle mynde. In Countreye mayste thou safelye rest, And flye all these, yf that thou lyste, The Countrey therfore, iudge I best, Where godly lyfe, doth vyce resyste, Where vertuous exercyse with ioye, Doth spende the yeares that are to run, Where Uyces fewe, maye the annoye, This lyfe is best whan all is done. To Alexander Neuell of the blessed Sate of him that feeles not the force of Cupids flames. As ofte as I remembre with my self, The Fancies fonde, that flame by foolysh Loue, And marke the Furyes fell, the blynded elfe And Uenus she that raynes so sore aboue, As ofte as I do se the wofull state, Of Louers all, and eake their myserye, The ones desy- ryng mynde the others hate, Trothe with the one, with the other Trecherye, So ofte saye I, that blessed is the wyght, Yea Neuell blest, and double blest agayne, That can by rea- son rule his mynde a ryght, And take suche foo- lysh fadynge toyes for vayne. Alexander Neuells Awnswere to the same. The pl?ged mind in fluds of griefs The Sences drowned quyght, The Hart opprest. The flesh consumed The cha?ged state outright. The Body dryed by broylyng blase, Of preuy schorchyng Flame. The doulfull Face. The coutna?ce sad The drowping Courage tame. The Scaldyng syghes. The greuous groones The burning rage of fyre The ernest sute, The fruitles Toyle. The deepe and hot Desyre, The Braynes quight brusd &amp; crusht w? Cares. The euer duryng soore. The very paynes of Hell it self, with thousande mischyefes moore, Which wounded Harts enflamd with Loue with Gryefe do ouerflow, And works theyr endles plage &amp; spight Tyll Death from thence do growe. All these conclude him blest (my Googe) and trible blest agayne, That taught bi tract of Time can take Such fadyng Toyes for vayne. To Maystresse A. Synce I so long haue lyved in pain and burnt for loue of the, (O cruel hart) doste thou no more esteame the Loue of me, Regardst thou not, the health of hym? that the, aboue the rest Of Creatures all, and next to God, hath dearest in his brest. Is pytie placed from the so farre is gentlenes exylde? Hast thou ben fostred in the Caues, of Wolues or Lyons wylde? Hast thou ben so? why then no force, the lesse I meruayle I, Suche as the D?me, suche is the yong experyence trewe doth trye. Syth thou art of so fyerce a mynde, why dyd not God then place In the, with suche a Tygers Harte, a fowle yll fauerde face? Sure for no other ende but that, he lykes no Louers trade, And the therfore a ragynge Fende, an Angels face hathe made. Suche one as thou, was Gorgon ones as auncient Poets tell, Who with her Beautie mazed men, and nowe doth raygne in Hell. But mercye yet, of the I craue, yf ought in the remayne, And let me not so long the force, of flamyng fyre sustayne, Let pytie ioynde with beautie be, so shall I not dysdayne. My blud, my hart, my lyfe to spende with toyle, with stryfe, and payne, To do the good, my breath to loose, yf nede shall so requyre, But for my seruyce and my paynes thou gyuest me hate for hyre. Well now take this for ende of all, I loue and thou doste hate, Thou lyuest in pleasures happely. and I in wretched state. Paynes can not last for euermore, but tyme and ende wyll trye, And tyme shall tell me in my age, How youth led me awrye. Thy face that me tormented so, in tyme shall sure decaye, And all that I do lyke or loue, shall vanysh quyte awaye, Thy face in tyme shall wrynckled be, at whiche I shall be glad, To see thy forme transformed thus, that made me once so sad, Than shall I blame my foly moch and thanke the mightyest kyng That hath me saued tyll such a daye, to se so fonde a thyng. And tyll that tyme I wyll keepe close my flames and let them blase, All secretly within my brest, no man on me shall gase. I wyll not trespasse synfully, for God shall geue me grace To se the tyme wherin I shall neglecte thy folysh face, And tyll that tyme adieu to thee, God keepe thee far from me, And sende thee in that place to dwell, that I shall neuer see.

And put my Plow, in grosse vntylled soyle, And labour thus, with ouer weryed Spryght, But yf that God, do graunt me greater yeares. And take me not from hence, before my tyme, The Muses nyne, the pleasaunt synging feares Shall so enflame my mynde with lust to ryme, That Palingen I wyll not leaue the so, But fynysh the accordyng to my mynd.

When Hungers rage she hath exyled quyte, And supped well as falleth for her state. The selye Larke, doth take by force of flyght, And hyes to tree, where as she lodged late, And on the trem- blyng Byrde all nyght she stondes, To keepe her feete, from force of nyppynge colde, The amazed Wretche, within her ?nemyes handes, And closed fast, within the claspyng holde. Awayteth Death, with drowsye drowpyng Hart, And all the nyght with feare drawes on her lyfe, The gentle Byrde, whan darkenes doth departe Doth not depryue, the selye soule of lyfe, Nor fylles with her her hungred egre brest But wayeng well, the seruyce she hath done. To spyll the Blud, her Nature doth detest, And from so great a Cryme, her selfe doth shun. She lets her go and more with stedfast eyes. Beholds whiche way she takes with mazed flyght, And in those partes that Daye she neuer flyes Leaste on that Byrde agayne she chaunce to lyght. Loe, Blundston heare how kyndenes doth habounde, In selye Soules where Reason is exylde, This Byrde alone suffyseth to confounde, The Brutysh myndes of men that are defyled, With that great Uice, that vyle and haynous Cryme Ingratitude (whiche some vnkyndenes call.)

Cupido Conquered. The sweetest time of al the yeare it was when as the Sonne, Had newly entred Gemini, and warmynge heate begun: Whan euery tre was clothed greene, and flowers fayre dyd show, And when the whyt and blowmynge May on Hawthorns thicke did grow, Whan sore I longd to seeke a broade, to se some Pleasaunt syght, A mid my woes and heauye happes, that myght my Mynde delyght, Care wold not let me byde within, but forst me foorth to go: And bad me seeke sume present helpe, for to relyue my wo. Than forward went I foorth in haste, to vew the garnysht trees? What tyme the Son was mo?ted vp, twirt nyne and ten degrees. From Flowers flew sweete ayers abroad, delighting much my brayn, With syght &amp; smels gan sorow fade, and Ioy returne agayne. So that in mynde I much reioyce. to feele my self so lyght: For gorgyous syghtes &amp; odours sweet had new reuyued my spryght. Besyde the pleasaunt Harmonye, that syngyng Byrdes did make: Bad me pul vpp my Hart agayne, and sorrow sone forsake. For though (quoth Reason.) she be gon on whom thy Lyfe dependes, Yet fond it is to carke and care where there is none amendes. Thus foorth I went, &amp; in the grooues I raunged heare and theare, Wheras I hard suche pleasa?t tunes as Heauen had ben neare. I thynke that if Amphion hadde, ben present ther to playe, Or if Sir Orpheus myght haue held, his Harp, that present day. Or if Apollo with his Lute, had stryuen to excell, None of them all, by Musycke sholde, haue borne away the Bell. I rather iudge the thracian wold, his Harpe wherwith he played, Haue cast away as one whom Ire, had vtterly dismayed. Such passyng tunes of sundry Byrds, I neuer herd before, The further I went in the Woods. the noyse resounded more. O happy Byrdes quoth I what lyfe, is this that you do leade, How far from Care and mysery, how far from Feare and dread: With what reioysynge melodie, passe you this fadyng Lyfe, While Man vnhappiest creatur liues In wretched toyle and stryfe. Styll foorth I went and wonderd at, this plesaunt Harmony. And gased at these lytle Fooles, that made suche Melody: Tyll at the length I gan to spye, a stately Lawrell tree, So plast and sett in such a guyse, That as it seamed to me, Dame Nature stroue to shew her self in plantyng such a thyng, For Euen out besyde the rocke, a fountayne cleane did spryng, Where in the water I beheld, resembled wonderous trew, The Whyte &amp; Greene of al the trees, adourned late of new. And how in order eake they stood, a goodly syght to se, And there I might discerne the Byrds that songe in euery tree. To moue the Byll &amp; shake the wings in vteryng Musicke sweete And heare and thear, to flye to feade, and eftesones theare to meete. Great pleasure had I there to byde, and stare vpon the Spryng, For why me thought it dyd surmount, eache other kynde of thyng. Now was the Son got vp aloft, and raught the mydle Lyne, And in the Well, the Golden Gloobe, with flamyng Beames dyd shyne, Wherof the Bryghtnes was so great that I might not endure, Lenger to looke within the Spryng, whose waters were so pure. Unwyllyng went I thence away, and vnderneth the tree, I laid me down whose bra?ches brode dyd keepe the Son from me. Thynkyng to rest me there a whyle, tyll fallyng some degrees Syr Phebus shuld haue hyd hym self, behynde the shadowyng trees, And th? for to haue vewd the Spring, and marked euery place, And seene yf there I could haue spied the weepyng Biblis face. For sure I thynke, it was the place, wherein Narcissus dyed, Or els the Well, to which was turnd poore Biblis whyle she cryed. But whether it was werynes, with labour that I tooke, Or Fume y? fr? the Spryng dyd ryse, wherin I late dyd looke. Or yf it were the sweete accorde that syngyng Byrdes dyd keepe, Or what it was, I knowe no whit but I fell fast a sleepe. I thynke the woddy Nimphes agreed that I shuld haue this cha?ce, And that it was theyr pleasure so, to showe me thyngs in traunce. Whilste I lay thus in slumbre deepe. I myght perceyue to stande, A Person clothed all in whyte, that held a Rod in hande. Whiche was me thought of Massey Gold, I knew it very weale, For that was it, made Argos sleepe, whyle he dyd Io steale. When I perceaued by his attyre, that it was Mercuri. My Hart at fyrst began to faynt, yet at the length quoth I Thou Goddesse Son, why standste y? there what busines now w? thee, What meanest y? in thy flying weed, For to appeare to me, And therwithall my thought I staied, and could no farther speake, For Feare did force my spech to fayle, and Courage waxed weake. Which whan the sone of Maia sawe, he tooke me by the hand, Looke vp quoth he be not affrayed: but boldly by me stand. The Muses all of Helicon, haue sent me now to thee: Wh? thou doest serue &amp; whose y? sekst For euer more to be. And thankes to the by me they sende, Bycause thou tookest payne, In theyr Affaires (a thankeles thyng) to occupie thy Brayne. Desyring thee not for to staye, for Momus ill report, But endyng that thou hast begun, to spyte the Canckred sorte. And thynk not thou, that thou art he, that canst escape Disdayne, The day shall come when thankfull men, shall well accept thy Paine, But rather lay before thyne eyes, the hie attemptes of those, Whose statly style w? painfull proofe, theyr worthy wytes disclose, Marke him that thundred out y? deeds Of olde Anchises sun, Whose English verse gyues Maroes grace, In all that he hath done, Whose death the Muses sorrow much, that lacke of aged dayes, Amongest the c?mon Brytons old, should hynder Virgils prayse. Mark him y? hath wel framde a Glasse, for states to looke vpon, Whose labour shews the ends of th?, that lyued long a gone. Marke hym that showes y? Tragedies thyne owne famylyar Frende, By whom y?

Marke these same three, &amp; other moe, whose doyngs well are knowne, Whose fayre attempts in euery place The flying fame hath blowne, Hast thou not harde, thy selfe in place full ofte and many a tyme, Lo here the Auctor loseth grace, Loe here a doltysh Ryme, Now syth that they haue this reward who passe the euen as farre, As in the nyght Diana doth, Excell the dimmest Starre. Take thou no scorne at euyll tongs, what neadst thou to disdayne? Syth they wh? none can well amend haue lyke fruyte of theyr payne. Moreouer yet the Ladyes nyne, haue all c?maunded me, Bycause they know, the blynded God hath somethyng pearced the. To leade the foorth, a thyng to see, yf all thyngs happen ryght, Whiche shall gyue the occasion good, with ioyfull mynde to wryght. To this, I wold haue answered fayne and theare began to speake, But as my words were c?myng forth my purpose he dyd breake. Come on (quoth he,) none Aunswere now we may no lenger staye. But frame thy selfe, to flye abroade, for hence we must awaye. And here withall, on both my sydes, two wyngs me thought dyd growe, Of mighty breadth, away went he, and after hym I flowe. And euer as we mounted vp, I lookte vp on my wyngs, And prowde I was, me thought to see suche vnacquaynted thyngs. Tyll foorth we flewe, my Guyde &amp; I, with mowntyng flyght apace, Beholdyng Ryuers, woods, &amp; Hylles and many a goodly place. Till at the length methought I might a Gorgyous Castell spye, Thear downe began my guyd to fall, and downward eake fell I, Lo heare the place where y? must light Gan Mercury to saye, Farwell and note what thou doost se, for I must hence away. And with this same a way flewe he, and left me there alone, Wher as with Feare a masde I stood, and thus began to mone. Alas where am I now become, what Cursed Chaunce hath blown, Me from the place where I was bred, to Countreis heare vnknown. What ment that fell vnhappy Feend, that Maia brought to lyght, To bring me from my Hartes desyre, to see thys dolefull syght. Unhappy Wretche, I wolde I hadde, his Person heare in hand, Then shuld I wreak mine Ire of him, that brought me to this Land. But all to late alas I wysh, for words auayle not nowe, Tis best to learne, what place it is, and yet I knowe not howe. Alas that here were Ptholome, with Compasse Globe in hande, Whose Arte shuld showe me true the place &amp; Clymate where I stande, Well yet what soeuer cha?ce theron what soeuer Realme it be, Yon Castell wyll I vysyte sure, hap what hap wyll to me. Thus much me thought alone I spoke and then I forewarde went, And cursed eke an hundred folde, them that me thyther sent. Thus to the Castell, strayght I came, whiche when I vewde aboute, And sawe the workmanshyp therof full gorgeouslye set oute, I entred in, with fearefull Harte, muche dautyng howe to speede, But euer hope of happye chaunce, my heauye Hart dyd feede. Wyde was the Courte &amp; large within the walles were raysed hye, And all engraued with Storyes fayre of costlye Imagrye. There myght I se, w? wondrous Arte, the Picture porturde playne, Of olde Orion Hunter good, whom Scorpions vyle had slayne. And by hym stoode his Borspeare and his other Instruments, His Net, his Darte, his Coursar, and his Hunters restyng Tents. And vnder hym was wrytten fayre, in Letters all of Golde, Here lies he slain, w? Scorpions sting, vnhappy wretche that wolde, Haue forced the Ladye of this forte with stayne of Royaltie. To haue consented to his wyll, in fylthye Lecherye. Wherfore beware that enters here, what soeuer man thou art? Accounte thy selfe but lost, yf that thou bearste a lecherous Hart. Wh? I had vewd these wrytten lines and markde the Storye well, I ioyed muche, for why I knew, Diana there dyd dwell. Diana she that Goddesse is, of Uirgyns sacred mynde, By whom Orion Hunter wylde, his Fatall ende dyd fynde. Next vnto hym, I myght beholde, Acteon wofull wyght, In what a maner, all to torne, his cruell Dogs hym dyght. There might be seene, theyr gredye mouths w? Maisters blud embrued, And all his owne vnhappye men, that fast theyr Lorde pursued. And many Storyes more there war engraued: to long to tell. What fearefull haps to many men, for lust vncleane befell. Thus as I stoode with musyng mind beholdyng all thyngs theare, In rush ech at the Gate behynde a Post with heauy cheare. Into the Hall with haste he hyes and after folowed I, To here what kynde of Newes he brought or what he ment therby. He passyng through the Hall in haste, at entraunce neuer stayed, But blowyng fast for want of breath, as one almoste dismayed. Approcht in Presence to the syght of chaste Dianaes face, That all encompaste rounde aboute with Uirgyns in that place, In loftye Chayre of hye estate dyd syt, all clothde in whyte, Of Syluer hewe, that shynyg gaue, me thought, a gorgeous syght. There dyd I se, fayre Dido Queene and fayre Hisiphile, And next to them Lucretia sat, and chaste Penelope. But these same foure, no Bowes dyd beare for Uirgyns sacred state, They had forsaken long ago, and ioynde with faythfull Mate. On the other syde, sat all the sorte of fayre Dianaes trayne, Whose trade with toyle amongst the woods was euer bent to payne. Whose sacred minds, were ner defyld with any wanton lust, Whiche neuer could the fyckle state, of Louers fancye truste. The chyefe of them was Ismenis, whom best Diana loued, And next in place sat Hyale, whom neuer Fancye moued, Next vnto them sat Nipha fayre, a Gemme of Chastyte. And next to her sat Phyale, not basest in degree, Behynde them all, of passyng forme, fayre Rhanis held her place, And nye to her I myght discerne Dame Piccas shynyng face, These Pryncely Nymphes accompaned Diana in her Baynes, Whyle as in shape of Stagge poore wretche Acteon had his paynes. Aboue them all I myght beholde, as placed before the rest, Hipolitus whom Phedraes spyte? most Cruelly had drest. Hipolitus the vnspotted Pearle: of pure Uirginitie, Whose noble Hart culd not agre, to stepdames vyllany. Next vnto hym sat Continence, and next was Labour placed? Of bodie bygge and strong he was, and somwhat Crabtre faced. Next hym was placed Abstinence, a leane vnwyldy wyght, Whose Diet thyn had banisht cleane, all fond and vayne delyght. A Thous?d more me thought ther war whose names I did not know, And yf I did to longe it were, in Uerses them to show. Down of his knees the messenger, before them al doth fall, And vnto chast Diana thear, for succour thus doth call. O Goddesse chiefe of Chastitie, and Sacred Uirgins mynd: Let Pitie from your noble Hart: redresse for Misers fynd. Let not our weryed Hartes sustaine, suche wrongfull Tyranye? Quench quickly now the fyrie flames of open Iniurye. This sayd for Feare he staied awhyle, and than began agayne, A myghty Prynce (quoth he) is com, with great vnruly trayne. All armed well at euery poynt, (a dredefull syght to se:) And euery man in feates of armes, ryght skylfull all they be. The Captaine chyfe in Charyot ryde with pompe and stately Pryde: With Bow in hand of glistring gold, and Quyuer by his syde. Wher many a shaft full sharp doth ly: and many a mortall Darte, That hath w? poysoned force destroid, Full many a yealdyng Harte. He entred hath within your Realme, and taken many a Forte, Hath sakte them all, and spoylde them quyte &amp; slayne a wondrous sorte. In straungest guyse, for where he shoots the wo?de doth fester styll And all the Surgians that we haue can not remoue the yll, In lytell tyme the gryefe so sore, doth growe in euery parte, Distraynyng through the venomed vaines doth so torment the Hart. That some to ryd themselues therof in fluds full deepe they leape, And drown th? selues som downward falles from Houses hye by heape, Some Anker cast on crossed Beames to ryd them selues from stryfe, And hang them selues full thycke on trees to ende a wretched lyfe. And they whose fearefull mynds dare not thus make an ende of wo, With greuous flames, consumynge long theyr lyfe at length forgo. Loe here the S?me of all I haue, this Tygre vs anoyes, And cruellye hath spoyled vs, of all our wonted ioyes. Whom yf your Grace, do not repuls, and fynde some present staye, Undoubtedly he wyll wyn this Realme, and take vs all awaye. At this, the Ladyes all amazde for feare dyd looke full pale, And all beheld with mazed eyes, the Wretche that tolde the tale. Tyll at the length Hipolitus of Hart and courage hye, Nothyng abashde, with sodain newes began thus to replye. Caste fere away, fayre Dames (quoth he) dismaye your selues no more, I know by wh? this mischief spryngs and know a helpe therfore. It is not suche a dredefull Wyght, as he doth here reporte, That entred is within these partes, and plagues the symple sorte. Nor is his force so great to feare, I know it I full well: It is the scornfull blynded Boy, that neare to vs doth dwell. Whom Mars long tyme a go begatt, of that Lasciuious dame: That Linckt in Chaines for Lechery, receaued an open shame. A disobedient blynded Foole, that durst presume to turne: His dartes agaynst his mother ons, and causd her sore to burne. An auncient foo: to all this Court, Of long tyme he hath ben: And hath attempted euermore, by this: Renowne to wyn. His cruell Hart, of Pitie voyed, doth spare no kynd of age: But tender youth and dotyng age, he strykes in furyous rage. And laughes to scorne the sely soules that he hath wounded so, No fine appoynted of theyr ils, no end of al theyr wo. But syns he hath presumed thus, to entre heare in Place, And heare to threten Conquests thus, agaynst Dianaes Grace, Let him besure his loftie Mynde, this deade shall soone repent, If that your grace do here agre, with Fre and full concent. To make me Cheftain of this Charge and whom I lyst to chose, If Prisoner heare I bryng hym not, Let me myne Honour lose. And there he ceasde with ioyfull looks the Ladyes smyled all, And thorough his wordes they hoaped soone to se Cupidoes fall. With heauenly voice Diana thear, as chyefe aboue the rest: This wise her words began to frame, From out her sacred brest. My good Hipolitus quoth she, whose true and faythfull mynd: In doubtfull daunger often I, do alwayes redy fynd. For to reuenge the cankred rage, of all my spytfull foes, Thou be fr? whose vnspotted hart, the fluddes of vertue flowes. whose seruise long hath ben aproued, within this court of myne, Restrayne this boyes vnruly rage, by valyant means of thyne, I geue the leaue &amp; thee appoint, my cheyf Lieutenant here, Chuse whom y? wilt take whom y? lyst, thou nedest no whit to feare. With this he rose from out his place, and lokynge round a bout: Chose Abstinence and Continence, with Labour Captayne stout. And with these thre he tooke his leaue of all the Ladyes there, Who doubtyng of his safe returne, let fall full many a teare. He lefte them theare in heauynes, and made no more delaye, But outward went &amp; toward y? C?pe, he tooke the nearest way. With this the Queenes commyssion straight was sent abroad in haste, To rayse vp souldiars round about, and with theyr Captayne plaste. To bring them foorth &amp; marching on, Hipolitus to meet, Than sounded Trumpetes al abroad, and Drumes in euery streat. And souldiears good lyke swarmes of Bees theyr Captains prease about All armed braue in Corsletes white, they march with courage stout. And forwarde shoue, till at the length where as theyr marshall lyes, They fynd the place the ioifull so?ds, Do mount aboue the skyes. Hipolitus receaued them all, with woordes of plesaunt cheare, And placith them in good aray, bycause the camp was neare. Three Battails big of them he frams, and of the Rereward strong, Hath Labour charge who steppeth foorth, before the statlye thronge: And Captayn of the reare ward next, was placed abstinens. And Ioind to him for Policie, was Captayne Continence: The Battayle mayne Hipolitus, him selfe did chuse to guyd. And in the formest front therof, on Courser fayre doth ryde: The Trumpets sound march on apace, and Dromes the same do stryke. Then forward moues y? Army great, In order Martiall lyke. I cam behynde (me thought) and best, it seamed then to me: To vew the dynt of dreedfull sword, and feyghter none to be. Thie Spies were sent abroad to vew, the place where Cupide lay: A longest a Ryuer fayre and broad, they spye a pleasaunt way, Which waye they tooke and passynge foorth, at length apeares a plaine: Both large &amp; vast wher lyes y? rowt, of Cruell Cupides trayne. Thus told the spyes we onward hye, and strayght in syght we haue, The ferfull show of all our Foes, and dredfull army braue, The first y? marched fr? Cupides Camp was drowsy Idlenes. The chyefest frend that loue had then, the next was vyle Exces. A Lubbour great, mishapen most, of all that thear I saw, As much I thynk in quantitie, as Horses syre can draw. A myghty face both broad and flat, and all with Rubies set: Muche nosed lyke a Turky Cocke, with teth as blacke as Get. A Belye byg, full trust with guts, and Pestels two, lyke Postes, A knaue full square in euery poynt, a Prynce of dronken Dostes. Upon a Camell couched hye, for Horse coulde none hym beare, A mighty Staffe in hande he had, his Foes a farre to feare. Behynde them all, the blynded God, doth com in Charyot fayre, With ragyng flames flong rounde about he pestres all the ayre. And after hym, for tryumphe leades a thousande wounded Harts, That gush abrode hot streams of blud new persed with his Dartes, The army redy for to meete and all at poynt to fyght, Hipolitus with lusty cheare and with a noble Spryght. His Souldiers to encourage. Thus his wordes begyns to place. My valyaunt frends and Subiects all of Chast Dianaes Grace. whose noble Harts were neuer staind with spot of Dastards mynd, Behold our enemyes here at hande, behold yon coward blynd. Of lytle force, comparde with you howe in a fond araye, They stragle out no ordre dewe, obserued in theyr waye. Behold what goodly Guyds they haue to gouerne them withall, That neuer knew what fighting ment but lyue to Uenus thrall. Marke hym that guyds the rerewarde there that vyle deformed Churle, Whose foggy Mates, with paunches syde do thycke aboute him whurle. And he that formost hether coms loe what a handsome Squyre, Sure full vnapt to kepe the felde, more fyt to syt by the fyre. In fyne lo Uictorye at hande with hye tryumphant Crowne, Bent for to spoyle our Foes of Fame, and cast theyr Glorye downe. Fyght therfore now courageouslye, and ryd your frendes of feare, Declare your Manhod valyauntly, and let your Harts appeare. With this the sounde begyns to mo?t and noyse hye to ryse, And warlyke tunes begyn to dash, them selues agaynst the Skyes. The Canons Cracke, begins to roore and Darts full thycke they flye And couerd thycke, the armyes both, and framde a Counter Skye. And now the Battayls both be ioynde with stroke of Hande to trye. The quarell iust and for to fynde, where Victory doth lye, The Souldyers all of Idlenes, where Labour coms, do fall, And wounded sore, by force of hym, all bathde in blud, they sprall. Hym selfe alone with Idlenes nowe hande to hande doth fyght And after many a mortall wounde, destroyes the selye wyght. Then ioynes with him Syr Abstinence with ayde &amp; succours newe, And both vpon the gresye Hoaste, of Glottonye they flewe. The Captayn doth aduaunce hymself with Abstinence to meete, The vnweldy Creature smitten there is tombled vnder feete. Than Fancie flyes Incontinence and all Cupidoes frendes. Beholdynge Fortune thus to frowne, by flyght them selfe defendes. Cupido whan he sees hymselfe, thus spoylde of all his ayde, The chyef Supporters of his Courte, so sodaynly decayde. Bad turne his Charyottes than with haste and fast away he flyes, Amongst the chaste Hipolitus on swyftye Courser hyes, Than all with Ioye they after run, downe thycke the enemyes fall, The blinded boy, for succour straight to Venus hye doth call, But all his cryes auayleth not, his Foes hym fast pursewe, The dryuer of his Charyot soone, Hipolitus there slewe. And down fr? Horse, the wretche doth fall. The horses spoyld of guyde, A Souldier stoute of Reasons bande, is wylled there to ryde. Who turyng Raynes another waye restrayns hym of his flyght, His Honours lost and taken thus, Cupide in dolfull plyght. These wordes with tremblyng voyce began syth Fortune thus quoth he, Hath giuen her doome from doubtfull brest &amp; turnd her Grace from me. Syth that the most misfortune nowe, that euer I could fynd, Hath chaunced to me and Myser I, by Destenyes assygnde, Am Captyue heare, consydre yet, what Fortune myght haue wrought And made a Canquerer of me, and you in Bondage brought. Consydre yet the wofull plyght, wherin you had remaynd, If that the Gods my happy state, had not so sore disdaynd, And by your Gryef, than mesure mine showe mercye in this case, That Conquerour c?mended is, who gyues to pytie place. The cruell mynd dispraysed is, In euery kynd of state, No man so hauty lyues on earth, but one may fynd his mate, These wordes Hipolitus I speake, to bread no farther stryfe, I speake not this of malyce heare, my sute is for my lyfe. Syth Fortune thus hath fauord you, graunt thus my small request, And let me lyue yf mercy dwell, within your Noble brest, By this tyme Morpheus had disperst the drowsy Clowd of sleape, And fr? my braynes the quyet tra?ce, began full fast to Creape. And dounward fell. I wakd therwith and lokyng round a bout, Long tyme I mused where I was, my mynd was styl in doubt. Tyll at the length I vewde the tree, and place where as I sat, And well beheld the pleasa?t Spryng that late I wondred at. that late I wondred at, I sawe besyde the Golden Globe, of Phebus shynyng bryght, That Westwarde halfe, dyd hyde his face approchyng fast the nyght. Eche Byrde began to shrowd hymself in tree to take his rest And ceaste the pleasaunt tunes y? late proceaded from theyr Breaste. I homewarde went, and left them all, and restles all that nyght, I musynge laye, tormented thus, with fond lamentyng spryght. When Phebus rose to passe the tyme, and passe my gryefe awaye I toke my Pen and pend the Dreame that made my Muses staye. Finis.</field>
