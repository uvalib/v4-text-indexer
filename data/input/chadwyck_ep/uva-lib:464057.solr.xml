[y] e worldly folk, avys√´ yow betymes Wych in thys lyff [ne] ben [but as pylgrimes], Lyk straungerys [ffer√´ fro youre Cuntre] Vnfraunchysed and [voyde off lyberte]; ffor schortly her√´ yovre poscessyon ys yove to yow but for a schort sesoun, Nor the tresovr√´ wych that ye possede ys but thyng lent ho so kan tak√´ hede, ffor clerkys seyn how [that] al erthly thyng Stownd√´mel, and by vnwar chaungyng, Whan folk lest wen√´ &amp; noon hede ne take, Her mayster old√´ sodeynly for-sake. Thyng myn to-day a-nother hath to-morwe; That kam wyth Ioye departeth ay wyth sorwe; And thyng ywonne wyth Ioy√´ and gladnesse, Ay dysseuereth wyth wo and hevynesse. No tresour here, wyth O man wyl abyde; Who strengest halt ther rathest hyt wyl slyde; ffortune ys lady with hyr double face, Of every thyng that sodeynly doth pace; Sche pryncesse ys of al worldly glorye, And off al Ioy√´ that ys transyt√≥rye; Sche ys off chere so varyaunt &amp; dovble, Hyr kalm ys euere meynt with wo &amp; trovble, And hyr sugre [ys] vnder-spreynt wyth galle: Thys hyr vsage vn-to estatys alle, To schewe fayrest whan sche ys most to drede; Of hyh ne lowh sche taketh noon other hede, ffor wych [let] no man vp-on hyr assure, ffor sche ys lyke to the chavnteplure; Wo after Ioye &amp; after song wepyng, Thys hyr cvstom in every maner thyng. In on estate she neuere doth contyune. Thys stormy quen, wych callyd ys Fortune Hyr gyfftys all√´ in conclusion, Be not but gyffytys off confusion. ffor worthynesse in Armes nor vyct√≥rye Arn in effect but thing√´s transyt√≥rye Nor hih conquest, nor domynacion, Peplys to putt√´ in subieccyon. It al schal passe as doth a somer flovr; In thys world her√´, holdyng no soiovr No thyng abyt, shortly for to wryte, Good lyff exepte, and only ovr meryte. Trusteth ther-for, ye folk of euery age, That yowre lyff her ys but a pylgrymage; ffor lyk pylgrymes ye pass√´ to &amp; ffro, Whos Ioye ys euere meynt A-mong with wo. Al worldly blyss√´, medlyd ys with stryff; ffor ay the c√∂urs, of thys mortal lyff, Euerych hovr doth to hys boundys drawe; To al pylgrym√´s kynd hath set a lawe, Eche day to Renne a party on ther way; Old√´ ner yong, ther may no man sey nay, Lyk a Ryuer sterne, and of gret myght, Ne restyth nat nouther [by] day nor nyght, To holde hys cours as ledeth hym the streem, Ryght so, pylgrymes to-ward Ierusaleem Haste on her way in thys world, &amp; echone To-ward that cyte, or to Babylone. Lyk ther merytes, &amp; lyk to ther degres, They be Receyved at on of thys cytees, Ytakyn inn√´, so as they dysserve; And deth, ay redy with hys dart to kerue, Lyth in a-wayt, dredful off manacys, To send palmerys to on off thys placys. A-geyne whas strok√´, helpeth no medycyne, Salue, tryacle but grace only dyvyne, ffolk to conveye to ther desyred place: And many brygaunt the weye doth manace, No man ys sur hym syluen to diffend; Wherfore I rede, lat euery whyht a-mend Hys lyff be tyme, whil he hath liberte. And that folk may the Ryht√´ wey√´ se Best assuryd to-ward√´ ther passage, Lat hem be-holde[n] in the pylgrymage, Which callyd ys pylgrymage de movnde, In the wych fful notably ys fovnde, Lernyd, and tavht, who can well construe, What folk schal take, &amp; what they schal eschue. In thys book, yf [that] they red√´ yerne, Pylgrym√´s schal the verray trouth√´ lerne,‚Äî yiff they sette ther trew√´ dyllygence To vnderstond√´ clerly the sentence,‚Äî What hyt menyth, &amp; the moralyte; Ther they may, as in a merovr, se holsom thynges, &amp; thynges full notable; What ys prevyd, &amp; what thyng ys dampnable, What ys holsom, the sovl√´ for to save, Whan the body ys leyd in hys grave. And to know√´ wych be cyteseyns, Trew√´ burgeys, &amp; ek√´ fraunkeleyns, Wych in good lyff and vertu do excelle, In Ierusaleem perpetually to duelle, Whan the Iugge &amp; Lord, that lyveth evere, In hys doom assovnder shal dysseuere Hys chos√´ shep, wasshe in the lambys blood, Wych for mankynd√´ starff vpon the rood; And putte the kyd√´s to dampnacion, wych ha noon part of Crystys passyon, Endlesly there to lyve in peyne, Where Lucyffer lyth bovnden in his cheyne. ffro the wych, God euery man defende, And graunt√´ grac√´, our lyff here to mende, To-ffor the ffyn of ovr√´ pylgrymage. ffor, save hys grace, we ha noon avauntage, No thyng is cleyme as be tytle of ryht, But of mercy, wych ay lyth in hys myght, Vn-to synnerys, that deye repentaunt, To yive pardon off hys benynge graunt, [The] Wych ys to hem, vn-to ther refut, Proteccyon and tru√´ sauff-conduit, Hem to sav√´, that thay be nat lorn. And thys book, the wych I spake off to-fforn, I mene, the book Pylgrymage de Movnde, Morall of vertu, of materys ful profovnde, Maad &amp; compylyd in the French√´ tonge, ffull not√°ble to be rad &amp; songe. To every pylgryme, vertuous of lyff, The mater is so contemplatyff; In all the book, ys not lost a word. Thys consydred full wysly of my lord Of Salysbury, the noble manly knyht, Wych in Fravnc√´, for the kyngys Ryht, In the werre hath meny day contunyd; Whom God &amp; grac√´ han ful wel ffortunyd In thenpryses wych he hath vndertake; Lyff and godes, for the kyngys sake, Knyhtly Inpartyd thys prince vertuous; Ay in the ende beyng victoryous, Swych grace &amp; Eur, God to hym hath sent, Wych gaff me ffyrst in comavndement Thys seyd√´ book in Englysshe for to make, As I koude, [al] only for hys sake. Be-cause he wold√´ that men schold[e] se, In ovre tonge, the grete moralyte Wych in thys book ys seyde &amp; comprehendyd, That yt ne myhte (me semyth) be Amendyd; The auctour, wych that dyde hyt ffyrst compyle, So vertuously spent ther-on hys whyle. And of entent to do my lord plesaunce, In hys worschep√´, for a remembravnce, As I am bovnde for to be hys man, I wyl translate hyt sothly as I kan, After the lettre, in ordre effectuelly. Thogh I not folwe the word√´s by &amp; by, I schal not faill√´ teuchyng the substaunce, Thogh on makyng I ha no suffysaunce; ffor my wrytyng, in conclusion, ys al yseyd vnder correcion. And of the tyme playnly, &amp; of the date Whan I be-gan thys book to translate, yt was a thovsand (by computacion) Affter crystys incarnacion, ffour hundryd ouer, nouther fer ne nere, The surples ouer, syxe &amp; twenty yere, My lord that tym√´ beyng at Parys, Wych gaff me charge, by hys dyscrete avys, As I seyde erst, to sett√´ myn entent Vp-on thys book to be [ful] dyllygent, And to be-gynne vp-on thys labour, All√´ folkys be-sechyng of ffavour, That on thys book after-ward schal rede; And that hym lyst nat to taken hede To the makyng, but to the sentence; ffor I am bareyn of all eloquence. Ther-for I pray, what so that be seyde, [Off gentyll]esse not to be evel apayde, And my rudness√´ helpyn to excuse, ffor in metre I ha ne with me no muse: Noon of the nyne that on Parnase duelle, Nor she that ys [the] lady of the welle, Calliop√´, be syd√´ cytheron, Gaff to my penn√´, plente nor fuso? Of hyr licovr, whan thys work was [be]gonne. Nor I drank no-wer of the sugryd tonne Off Iubiter, couchyd in hys celer, So strange I fonde to me hys boteler, Off poetys [i]callyd Ganymede. But to my labour now I woll me spede, Prayng ech reder me to reconforte, Benign√´ly my rudenesse to supporte. ffor wherso be my thonk, I lese or wynne, Wyth yowr√´ grac√´ thus I wyll be-gynne. Here endyth the prologe off the translatour. Her be-gynneth the prologue of the auctour. fful ofte hyt happeth in certeyn Off dremys,‚Äîthe wych that men ha seyn I nyhtys,‚Äîafter, whan they wake, fful lytel hede ther-of thay take, Tyl effte agayn yt comyth to mynde, That they the veray trouth√´ fynde, Of euery thyng they sawe to-forn. ffor, of remembraunc√´ the thorn Pryketh here mynd√´s with hys poynt, That they hyt se fro poynt to poynt, And fynde hyt verrayly yn dede, Thogh a-fore they took noon hede. Be yt of Ioye, be yt of sorow, fful ofte a-pon the nexte morow yt ys go clene out off her thouht, Ther-of they ha so lytel rouht, Tyl after they a-vyse hem wel; And then thay fyndyth yt euerydel, Dremys that they had a nyhte, By maner of a dyrked syhte. But yiff they mak√´ longe delay, To putte hem forth fro day to day, Than, th[o]rogh foryetelnesse, Thay kan there-of no thyng expresse, ffor all ys out of mynd√´ go. And on A tyme hyt happyd so, ffro Crystys berth a thousand yer, Thre hondryd, by a-cowntys cler, And over Ten, as I toke kepe, Vp-on a nyht I lay &amp; sclepe, Drempte, (yf ye lyst to lere,) A wonder dreme, in tyme yffere. The wych, a-noon as I a-wook Vp on the morow, a penne I took, And wrote yt, yff ye lyst to wyte, That I schold hyt nat foryete; But freschly yn my mynde yt kepe, Halff wakyng and halff a-slepe, That I myht after, by leyser, Correcte hyt when the day were cler, By good avys, whan I took kepe, Bet a-dawed out of my sclepe. And thys consyderyd cuery dele, Me sempte I hadd√´ do ryht wel, Yiff ther hadde, as tho to me, ffall√´ noon contraryouste; ffor al the wrytyng that I wrote Was me be-raffte, and how I not, Dyscured thurgh the world a brode, As God woot wel, and thus yt stood. Where-of I hadde as tho no shame, ffor al I hald yt but a game; ffor to that tyme fredam I hadde To putte away, and eke to adde, What that me lyst, lyk as I wende. ffor ther was mych√´ thyng to mende, To ordeyne, &amp; to correcte, And bet in order to directe; ffor many a thyng, yt ys no nay, Mot be prouyned, &amp; kut a-way, And yshape of newe entaylle, In ordre dresse hyt, &amp; yraylle, As doth euery manere whyht, That wol make a thyng a-ryht. ffor he that bar my dreme a-way, ffull lytel thouhte (yt ys no nay) On my profyt in any wyse; ffor shortly, as I kan devyse, I myghte beter a mendyt yt, Lyk as God hadde yeve me wyt, Sool by my sylff, than I may now; But all ys gone, I wot not how. And eke yt ys so long a-go, That thys dreem was take me fro, I haue almost foryete yt al. But not for-thy, yet I schal Adde, &amp; putte a-way also, Where-as I se yt be to do; I schal not leve in myne entent To putte alway a-mendement, As yt comyth to my knowynge, Day be day yt r√©membrynge. And when that yt a-mendyd ys, And se that nothyng be a mys, By a lace I shal yt were, And a-bowte my nekke yt bere, Send yt forth to euery contre, Wher-as to-fforn that yt hath be, A-geyn my wyl &amp; my plesaunce. And thus for a Remembraunce, Go fforth thow dreme! I send√´ the By all the placys wher thow hast be; I send the to thy provynours, By all the pathys &amp; the tovrs, ffor thow knowest the wey√´ wel, And the passage euerydel. On my be halff[e] thow not ffaylle To dresse yt ewyn by entaylle, Wher thow wer fferst, wych doth me greve, And took of me no maner leve. ffor wych I calle yt (thys the ffyn,) No verray wey√´ off pylgrym. By cavs√´, wherso, by the lak, On ffoot√´, nor on hors√´bak, Thow sholdest ha mad no Iourne, But thow haddest hadde leve off me. But ffor as myche as I in dede Thynk√´ the with me to lede, Whan I go, as thow schalt se, To Ierusaleem, the cyte; To wych weye, with-ovte more I am excyted wonder sore: Thys myn entent, thider to drawe, And a-mong pylgrymes, thys a lawe, That, as brother vn-to brother, Euerych sholde a-byden other. Thys sholde ben a trewe vsage Off folkys in ther pylgrymage. Doo tell√´ myn aventure cler, How passyd syx and twenty yer, Tell√´ vn-to on and all, How that yt ys [to] me ffall, In the Abbey off Chalys, Whylom ffoundyd off Seyn Lewyys. Here begynneth the pylgrym. The seyd√´ yer (ho lyst take kep) I was avysed in my slep, Excyted eke, and that a-noon, To Ierusalem for to goon. Gretly meved in my corage ffor to do my pylgrymage, And ther-to steryd inwardly. And to tell the caus√´ why, Was, ffor me thouht I hadde a syht With-Inne a merour large &amp; bryht, Off that hevenly ffayr cyte, Wych representede vn-to me Ther of holy the manere, With Inne the glas ful bryht &amp; cler. And werrayly, as thouht√´ me yt excellyde off bewte Al other in comparyson; ffor God hym selff was the masown, wych mad yt ffayr, at ys devys. ffor werkman was ther noon so wys, yt to conceyve in hys entent; ffor al the wey√´s &amp; paament Wer ypavyd all off gold. And in the sawter yt ys told, How the ffyrst ffundacyon, On hyllys off devocyon; The masounry wrought ful clene, Off quyk√´ stonys bryht &amp; schene, Wyth a closour rovnd a-bowte Off enmyes, ther was no dowte. ffor Awngelles the wach y-kepte, The wych, day nor nyht ne slepte, Kepyng so strongly the entre, That no wyht kam in that cyte, But pylgrymes, day nor nyht. That thyder wentyn evene ryht. And ther were meny mansyovns, Placys, and habytacyovns; And ther was also al gladnesse, Ioye with-ovten hewynesse. And pleynly, who that hadd√´ grace ffor to entren in that place, ffond, onto hys plesavnce, Off Ioye al maner suffysavnce, That eny hert√´ kan devyse. And yet the entre on swych wyse Was strongly kepte ffor komyng In; ffor the Awngel cherubin, Off the gate was cheff porter, Havyng a swerd, fflawmyng as cler As any ffyr, evene at the gate; And who that wold, erly or late, Passen the wal, he was yslawe. Ther ne was noon other lawe, Ne bet helpe, ne bet refut; The vengaunc ay was execut. In the passage thyder-ward, The wey√´ was so streiht &amp; hard, ffor tyravntys, with ther felonye And with ther mortel tormentrye, Devyseden on ther entent fful many wonderful torment, Lyggyng awayt fro day to day, To slen pylgrymes in ther way, Makyng ful grete occysion Off pylgrymes of grete Renovn, Off men &amp; wommen both yfere, Whos martyrdom (as ye schal here,) Was ful grevous to endure. ffor somme of hem (I yow ensure,) Wern out of here Skynnes flawe; And somm√´, by ful mortal lawe, Wer hew (as bokys kan Remembre,) Asonder, partyd euery membre, Crucefyed, of blood al Red; And many other lost hys hed. Of somme, the bowelys wer out Rent, And somme on hot√´ colys brent, ffretyng salt cast in among, ffor to make ther peynys strong Myd the ffyry flawmys reed. Somme boylyd in oylle and led, And sor√´ bet, that yt was wonder; Somme, sawyd evene assonder; Somme, with wyld√´ hors ydrawe, In dyffence of crystys lawe, Thorgh-out the ffeld, her &amp; yonder, Tyl ther Ioynt√´s wente a-sonder: Nerff and bon assonder Rent, And ther Entraylles aforn hem brent. The ffelouns wern on hem so felle, That yt ys pyte for to telle; And ther ys no man now a lyve That kan the peynys halff descryve; Nor a sermon ther-off make, What they suffrede ffor the sake Off Cryst Ihesu vn-to the deth, ffor love, tyl they yald vp the breth, Myd ther mortal peynys smerte. ffor ther ys noon so hard on hert, So despytous, nor so ffelon, That he [ne] wolde ha compassyon, Ben agrysed off pytee; And specyally ffor to se That they suffrede for no synne, But only off entent to wynne The love off Cryst; &amp; ffor hys sake, All they han vp-on hem take, Seyng how, ffull long aforn, Cryst to suffre was yborn, And fforbar nat to be ded. And sythen he that was her hed Suffrede peynys, deth, &amp; woo, The membrys wolde endure also, And ffolwe ther hed on al thyng, As Seyn Gregoir in hys wretyng Recordeth pleynly (who taketh hed) Off all√´ chose, Cryst ys hed; ffor wych, the membrys, as was due, Affter ther hed lyst to sue, Wych by example wente a-fore, To whom thentre was not fforbore. ffor swych as deyd√´ ffor hys love, By wyketys entrede in above, Vp the gat√´, hih aloffte, Thogh ther passage was not soffte; The porter lyst hem nat to lette. And ther pencellys vp they sette On cornerys, wher them thouht√´ good, Al steyned with ther ovn√´ blood. And whan that I parceyved yt, I conceyvede yn my wyt, That who schold√´ ther-with-Inne Entre by fforce, he most yt wynne By manhood only, and by vertu. ffor, by record off Seyn Mathew, The hevene (as by hys sentence,) Wonnen ys by vyolence. Crysostom Recordeth ek also,‚Äî Who lyst taken hed ther-to,‚Äî That gret vyolence &amp; myght yt ys, who that loke a-ryht, A man be born in erth her downe, And Ravisshe, lyk a champyon, The noble hihe hevenly place, By vertu only &amp; by grace. ffor vertu doth to a man assure Thyng denyed by nature. Thys to seyne, who lyst lere, That vertu makyth a man conquere The hih hevene in many wyse, To wych kynde may not suffyse To cleym√´ ther pocession, But she be guyded by Reson, Wych to vertu ys maystresse, To lede hyr also, and to dresse In hyr pylgrymage Ryght Above the sterrys cler &amp; bryht. ffor other weye koude I not se, To entre by in that cyte; ffor cherubyn, erly and late, Ay awaytynge at the gate, Was redy euer, and ther stood, Whos swerd was bloudyd with the blood Off Crystys holy passyon Whan he made our Redempcion, Mankynde to restore a-gayn. The wych wey, whan I hadde seyn, I was a-stonyd in my syht. But I was coumfortyd a-noon Ryht, Whan I sawh the swerd mad blont Off cherubin, the wych was wont To brenne as any flawmbe bryht. But now, the sharpnesse &amp; the lyht Was queynte, to do no more vengaunce, By vertu off crystys gret suffravnce, Wych schal no more for man be whet. And ther I sawh a smal wyket Ioynynge evene vp-on the gate; And ther stood on, erly &amp; late, Lenynge, as I kovde espye, Wych power hadde, &amp; maystrye ffor to opne &amp; to shette, To Receyven and to lette, Pylgrymes that kam on ther weye; And in hys hond he held a keye,‚Äî Seyn Peter, me thouht by hys cher,‚Äî That had off God pleyn power To lete in ffolk wych he knew hable. But ffyrst they most (thys no ffable,) Dyspoyllen hem, &amp; nakyd be; ffor noman entrede that cyte That clothyd was, nor myhte passe, Wher he mor, or wer he lasse, Or gret compact in any membre. And than A-noon I gan Remembre How Cryst sayde, in a certeyn place, That yt was as hard to passe In-to the hevene A reche man,‚Äî Lych as he rehers√´ kan By record off hys gospel,‚Äî As yt was to a kamel To passe throgh a nedlys Eye; Wych ys a thyng (ho kan espye,) As yt were an Inpossible, And verrayly Incredyble. Affter-ward (yt ys no ffayll) Me thouhte I sawh a gret mervayle: Vp-on Tours, dyuers estatys Off doctours and off prelatys, Showyng, as by contenavnce, By speche, and by dallyavnce, Techyng pylgrym√´s to knowe, That wer yn the val√´ lowe, How, with travayll√´ &amp; peyne, And how also they sholde atteyne To make hem wyng√´s ffor to fle Hih a-loffte to that cyte, By wynges of exaumple good, Yiff they ther lernyng vnderstood, Wych they tauhte hem in ther lyff By doctryne contemplatyff, Outward schewyng, as by cher, Ther love was to hem ful enter, ffovndyd vp-on charyte. Amongys wych I ded√´ se Grete noumbre of thys Iacobins, Off chanovns, &amp; of Awstynys, ffolkys ful diuers of maner, Both temporal &amp; seculer, Off clerkys &amp; relygyous, And other ordrys vertuous. Mendyvauntys ful nedy, That day &amp; nyht wer ryth besy To gedre ffetherys, bryht &amp; shene, And make hem wynges ffor to fflen. And gan A-noon, with al ther myght, To soren vp, &amp; take her fflyht Hih in-to that ffayr cyte. And hiher vp they dyd√´ ffle, Bove cherubin, that Avngel cler; ffor they wer out of hys davnger, By the techyng, and the doctrine, And by exaumples ek dyvyne, Wych ther maystres hadde hem tauht, Wher-by they han the hevene kauht, And ffounde ther-in gret avauntage To fforthre hem in ther pylgrymage, And how hem sylff they shold√´ guyde. And vp-on the tother syde, Vnder the wal of the cyte, I sawh, off gret auctorite, ffolkys, wych dyde entende To helpe her ffrendys to ascende, By ful gret subtylyte, To make hem entre the cyte; And ther-to dyde her bysy cure, By scalys throgh the strong closure; And as me thouhte, A-mong echon, That Seyn Benet in soth was on. Wych, as I rehers√´ shal, ffor to scale that hihe wal, That was so myhty &amp; so strong, With hym brouht a ladder long, In the wych men myht√´ se xij. gre√´s off humylyte, By wych, thor[o]gh deuocyon, ffolk off hys relygyon Ascendyd vp, gre by gre, With-ovt√´ lette to that cyte, And the ryht[√´] weye han take. Monkys grey√´, whyte, &amp; blake, Ascendyng vp with-out√´ ffeer. And Seyn Fravnceys I sawh ek ther, fful dyllygent, and ek bysy, And (as me thouht) ful ffrendly To ffolk of hys profession. And ek in myn avysyon I sawh ther cordys rovnd &amp; long, Al yffret with knottys strong, Hard to ffele, and nothyng soffte. And ffro the valey hih a-loffte Vp-on the wal they dede hem caste, And by the cordys held ham ffast, Grypyng hem with gret√´ peyne, Off entent they myghte atteyne To gete vp to that hihe wal, ffor to kepe hem ffrom a ffal, Alway by the corde hem held. And many A-nother I be-held, Off dyuers ffolkys that vp ran, Off whom the namys I not kan, Nor how they dyde hem sylff assure, Over the wallys to Recure On ech√´ party Round abovte; ffor I in soth, that stood with-oute, Myghte not be-holden al the paas, But on the party that I was, Wych was to me gret dysplesavnce. But I dar seyen, in substaunce, That ther was noon off no degre Wych entre myht√´ the cyte, But lefft with-out√´, low√´ doun, ffor al, hys sherp√´ &amp; bordoun. But thentent off hys vyage, And ffyn ek off hys pylgrymage, Wer set of hert√´ fynally Ther tabyde perpetuelly With ffeyth, hope, &amp; charyte, To lyve with rest on that cyte; ffor other thyng, in hert &amp; thouht, To her desyre they wold√´ nouht. ffor, as the phylisofre seyth, (To whom men mosten yeven feyth) That al ffolk, wherso they wende, What they do, ys for som ende. And for that skyl√´, more &amp; more, I was steryd wonder sore ffor to tak√´ my Iournee, Lyk a pylgryme, to that cyte. Off more Ioy√´ I nat kepte; And, me thouht ek, as I slepte, And in my dreem dyde ek mete, That ellys I myghte ha no quyete. And thus ful pensyff in my guyse, A-noon I gan me to a-vyse, And thouht in myn avysion, I ffaillede a sherpe &amp; bordon, Wych al pylgrymes ouhte to have, In ther wey, hem sylff to save. And so the pylgrymes hadde echon In ther vyage, but I allone. They wer echon by-ffore purveyd, Bet in ther wey to be conveyed And I roos vp, and that a-noon, And ffro myn hous gan out gon Vp-on my wey, off wych I tolde; Al be that I was long yholde, Or I myhte mak√´ my passage To gynnen vp-on my pylgrymage. Nyne monethes I was kept cloos, Tyl at the last I vp Aroos, Off entent forth to procede. But than at erst I gan take hede That, to myn entencioun, I myghte ffynden a bordoun And a sherpe, wych of vsage ffolk han that gon on pylgrymage, Nedful to me &amp; necessarye. ffor wych cause I dyde tarye Or I myghte gynne my Iournee, To holde my wey to that cyte; ffor wych I went complaynyng, Out off my sylff tryst &amp; wepyng, Cerchyng toforn &amp; ek behynde, Sherpe &amp; bordoun for to fynde. And whil I dyde my besynesse, A lady of ful gret ffayrnesse And gret noblesse, (soth to say,) I dyde mete vp-on the way. ffor God wold, (I yow be-hete,) Sone that I sholde hyr mete, Off grac√´ for myn own√´ prowh, Wher-off I hadd√´ Ioye ynowh, And in hert√´ gret gladnesse. ffor she, as by lyklynesse, Was douhter of som Emperour, Somme myghty kyng, or gouernour; Or off that lord that guyeth al, Wych ys of power most royal. And thys lady gracyous, Most debonayre, &amp; vertuous, Was yclad, by gret delyt, In a surcote al off whyt, With a Tyssu gyrt off grene. And Endlong, ful bryht &amp; shene, She hadde a charbouncle ston, That Round abowte hyr body shon; Was noon so reche, as I was war. And on hyr brest A nouche she bar, I trowe that nowher was no bet. And in the Awmaylle ther was sette Passyngly a rech√´ sterre, Wych that cast hys bemys ferre Round abovten al the place, Ther was swych haboundaunce off grace. Out of whos bosoom, mylde ynowh, Ther kam a dow√´ whyt as snowh, With hys wyng√´s splayng oute, Plauynge rovnd hyr hond aboute. Thys lady, of whom I ha told, Hadde on hyr hed a crowne of gold, Wrouht of sterrys shene &amp; bryht, That cast aboute a ful cler lyht. He was ful myghty, (who taketh hede,) That sette yt fyrst vp on hyr hed; And made yt ffyrst by gret Avys Off gret Richesse and gret√´ prys. Thys lady, that I spak of here, Was curteys &amp; of noble chere, And wonderly of gret vertu. And fyrst she gan me to salue In goodly wyse, axynge of me, What maner thyng yt myght√´ be, Or caus√´ why, I sholde hyr lere, That I made so hevy chere; Or why that I was ay wepyng, ffor lak of eny maner thyng.‚Äô Wher-of, when I gan tak√´ hede, I ffyll yn-to a maner drede, ffor vnkonnynge and lewd√´nesse, That sche, of so gret noblesse, Dysdeynede not in hyr degre To speke to on so pore as me; But yiff yt were, so as I gesse, Al only of hyr gentyllesse; ffor gladly, wher ys most bevte, Ther ys grettest hvmylyte, And that ys verrayly the sygne, Swych ar most goodly &amp; benygne. An appyl tre, with frut most lade, To folk that stonden in the shade, Mor lowly doth hys braunchys loute Than A nother tre with-oute; ffor wher haboundeth most goodnesse, Ther ys ay most of mek√´nesse. Noon so gret tokene of beute, As ys parfyt humylyte. Who wanteth hyr in hys banere, Hath not vertu hool &amp; entere. And affter thys I gan abrayde, And to hyr√´ thus I sayde, ‚ÄúHow to gon, I cast√´ me, To Ierusaleem the cyte, ffayllyng (to myn entencion) Both a sherpe &amp; a bordon, ffor wych I went, yt ys no doute, ffor to seke ham Round aboute, Yiff I myhte any fynde or se.‚Äù Grace dieu: ‚ÄòNow vndyrstond√´,‚Äô than quod she, ‚ÄòYff thow lyst hawe of hem tydyng, Thow mostest, ouer alle thyng To thyn entent, as thow shalt se, ffor thy profyt, kom, folwe me.

He shal yow shern duely in dede, Nat out of mesour, but for nede, Take hys part hym to sustene; And for that skyl√´, thus I mene, That he shal no vengeaunce make: Therfore he hath the sherys take, And nat the knyff, to Robbe &amp; slen, And folk out of her skyn to fflen; But cherysshe hem rather by fauour Than oppresse hem by Rygour: Thus sholde euery shepperde do, Resoun algat√´ techeth so.‚Äô And whan thys lady, dame Resoun, Hadde y-endyd hyr sermoun, Ther kam folk in sondry wyses, That a-bood to han servyses, Ordre off Colyt: Made ther requeste to Moyses; And he, Amongys al the pres Assygnede sondry offycerys. And somme off hem he made hussherys, And somme also he ordeynys To haue offyce off chaumberleyns; And sergauntys he made also, To whos offyce yt longeth to, The Enmy to putte away, Out of bodyes nyht &amp; day, Wher that euere by bataylle He ys hardy ffor to assaylle. Moses eke, who lyst take hede, Ordeyned Lystres for to rede, Myd the palys for to stonde, To mak√´ folke to vnderstonde The law√´, by ful gret avys, As longeth vn-to her offys. And somm√´, as I kan beholde, He made kandelys for to holde, And torchys for to yiv√´ lyht; By ther offyce, as yt was ryht, Thay held hem, as I toforn ha sayd, To-for the table, whan yt was layd; For sone he sholde to dyner gon. And vnto other he took a-noon Hys syluer cuppe gylt rich√´ly, And bad hem maken yt redy To seruen hym the sam√´ tyme. And some also, on ther lyfft syde, Vp-on ther shulderys, he made weere A Tookne off Cryst, &amp; yt to bere, That they sholde in especyal Awayte vp-on thoffycyal, As trewe seruauntys off entent, And be mynystres dyllygent, ffeythful, humble, &amp; covenable ffor to serue hym at the table. And than they gan, by good avys, Euerych to don hys owne offys, And dyden ek ther bysy cure To leyn the boordys, &amp; to cure With napry ful couenable. And somme sette vp-on the table (Lyk ther offyce) wyn &amp; bred; And somme also (I took good hed,) Lyst the wyn wer to strong, Putte in water ther a-mong: ffor yt was somwhat passyd pryme, Vp-on the hour off dyner tyme. But Moyses, to-for dyner, Caste hym fyrst, with ful sad cher, To delyuer hym that abood. And somme that aforn hym stood, He made hem offycerys newe, ffor to serwen and be trewe With-Inne hys hous, in specyal To wayte vp-on the offycyal, And to helpe hym in hys nede; ffor who that wysly taketh hede, May se wel that thoffycyal May nat allone gouernen al, But he haue helpe, swych as hym ouhte. Now shal I tell√´ how he wrouhte: Thys Moyses, among hem all, ffyrst he gan ful lowd√´ calle Grace dieu, al be that she Was fast√´ by, wych, in hyr se Sat vp in hyr trone on hyh; Sche was nat ffer, but wonder nyh, And took good heed of euery thyng. (And al thys whyle beholdyng, I sat at hyr ffeet doun lowe.) And whan she sawe &amp; gan knowe That she was callyd among echon, She taryeth nat, but kam anoon To Moyses ful evene &amp; ryght; And vn-to hym, with alle hir myght, She shewed hir-selff most frendely, Wher-off he gan waxen hardy Whan she was kome, and thowhte he was Myghty &amp; mor strong in thys caas To fulfyllen hys entent, Wych I, by good avysement, Shal vn-to yow shortly here Rehersen, yiff ye lyste to here. And Moyses, A-noon ryght than, Thus to werkyn he be-gan: Ther handys fyrst, as ye shal lere, Enoyntede, and closede hem yfere, ‚ÄòAnd took to hem ful cler &amp; bryht A swerd, the wych, vn-to my syht, Was thylk√´ same that Cherubyn Whylom held at Thentryng In At Paradys, who lyst to look; And key√´s ek to hem he took, To kepe hem wel in ther entent. And al thys whyle was ther present Grace Dieu, I took good heede, To helpyn hem the bet to spede. Whom Moyses took hem also, And sayde, (I took good hed ther-to,) ‚ÄòSyrs,‚Äô quod he, ‚Äòmost off vertu, Seth her to-for yow, Grace Dieu I gyve hyr yow for mor√´ grace, That she may, in euery place, At all√´ tym√´s with yow be, Yiff yt be-falle sothly that ye Receyue hyre, as ye ouht√´ do, With Ioy√´ &amp; glad herte also, And kepe hyr with yow day be day, That she neuere parte a-way.‚Äô And whan I herde al thys yfere, I wex abaysshed in my chere; Seyde vn-to my sylff ryht tho, ‚ÄúAllas, now, what shal I do?

And in the tyme off my wasshyng, The aduocat, by hyr byddyng, Spak for me in goodly wyse, As ye to-forn han herd devyse. Wher-fore I thouhte I wolde assaye To speke to hire, &amp; not delaye: ‚ÄúMa dame,‚Äù quod I, ‚Äúand yt yow plese, I am falle in gret dysesse, And dyscomforted in myn herte, Whan I consydre and aduerte, That Moyses gaff yow a-way; Which Gyfft ys no thyng to my pay; For yiff I wante yow, in certeyn My pylgrymage ys but in veyn.‚Äù Grace Dieu answereth: Quod Grace Dieu, ‚Äòyiff thow take hede, Thow hast verrayly in dede fforyete al that I ha the told.

Wher-as, a well√´ cloos aboute, Wych for-barreth folk with-oute, That no man ney√´ dar no ner, Lyst they fellyn in daunger. ‚ÄòAnd to purpos to expresse, I am welle of al goodnesse; Nat hold√´ cloos vn-to no wyht, But vn-to alle (of verray ryht) I am comwne and plentevous, And to profyte desyrous To goode pylgrymes euerychon, To forthre hem wherso they gon. ‚ÄòAnd thogh I be comoun to alle That vn-to myn help√´ calle, Thow mayst knowe &amp; trust√´ wel Thow hast nat lost me neueradel; ffor ay with the I wyl abyde, And neuere part√´ fro thy syde: As longe as thow hast th√® cast To ben a pylgrym sted√´fast, So long thow shalt nat off me faylle To helpe in what I may avaylle.‚Äô Affter al thys, I confort took, That Grace Dieu me nat for-sook, But me coumfortede off hyr grace.

And affter that, thogh he wer strong, They gan strechche hym forth along, On a barhyde off A Somer, Lyk a beste off A bocher, Voyde off pyte and off shame. And for he was a man off name (Semynge, by hys contenaunce,) Therfor they took√´ mor vengaunce Vp-on hym, and bounde hym sore; And Venus swyn, with brustlys hoore, Drowh hym forth On the bar hyde End√´long and ek a-syde, By brookys and by sloos fowle, A-mong the clay they hym dyffoule; On hym they wer√´ so cruel, The bar hyde halp neu√©radel; ffor thys old√´ wekkys tweyne Gan hym cerche, and ek constreyne; In euery place they han hym souht; They took hys good, they leffte hym nouht, And to hym dyd√´ gret disesse. And to me yt was noon ese To beholdyn and to se Ther tyranye, ther cruelte; And trew(√´)ly yt sat me sore, That the folk I spak off yore Halp nat hyr lord, but hym forsook, And, noon hed off hym they took, But in hys mescheff lefft hym sool; And lyk as he hadde ben a ffool, They scorned hym, and hadd√´ game, And gan lawhen at hys shame; They halp hym nouht, but leet hym be In hys grete aduersyte, Markede hym in hys mescheff, Ther he lay bounden as a theff, Scornynge at hys bak behynde. And swych folkys men may fynde In many place (yiff yt be souht); Whan a man ys to mescheff brouht, And falle in-to aduersyte, fful few√´ frendys than hath he; At mescheff, they hym for-sake, And but a Iape off hym they make, Al be yt so, that they beforn Wer supported and vp born By hys lordshepe, in ther degre. Whan he stood in prosperyte, Than they wold√´ make hem strong, To stonde with hym in ryht and wrong, With false behestys (as I ha told,) In al hys werkys make hym bold, That they wolde with hym abyde ffor lyff or deth, on euery syde; But fynally, whan al ys do, I ha wyst lordys deceyved so In dyvers contres, mo than on, Whan ther ffrenshepys wer agon. Lat no man trusten on ffortune, Wych selde, in on, lyst to contune. And thus thys man, brouht to the poynt, Stood allone in swych dysioynt, And in gret mescheff, as dyde I; ffor, Venus and Glotony In swych mescheff hadde hym brouht, That off hys lyff he rouht√´ nouht, ffor hys grete aduersyte. But than I gan remembre me As I lay bounden in the place, I wolde assayen ffor to pace The hegh, that was so thykke and strong, Off wych I tolde, nat go fful long; And for mor ese and sofft√´nesse, I thouhte I wolde my syluen dresse To the path on the tother syde; ffor, wher as tho I dyde abyde, Me sempte the plac√´ peryllous, Both√´ dredful and dotous.

Al thys I gan consydre and se, Swych routhe I hadd√´, and pyte, A-mong the sharp√´ busshys alle, That my body shold√´ falle In any daunger or dam√°ge, Yiff I passed√´ that pass√°ge; Prayd√´ god, for hys pyte, ffrom swych harm to saven me; ffor I stood in fful gret dred, Lyk a bryd that kan no Red, Wych, in hyr gret mortal ffer, Loketh her, and loketh ther, And for dred begynneth quake, Whan she ys in the panter take, Or engluyd with bryd-lym, Al hyr ffethrys fful off slym, Or vnwarly, in heth or holt, Ys y-slayn with arwe or bolt, Whil she ys besy to escape, The ffoulere kan hyr so be-Iape. Ryght so fferd I, al out off Ioynt, Brouht vn-to the sam√´ poynt; But ‚Äòwho that wyl nat whan he may, He ys a fool, (yt ys no nay,) And he ne shal nat whan he wolde.‚Äô ffor whyl I stood and gan be-holde Now her now ther, and for ffer shake, Vnwarly, by the ffeet ytake, I was bounden, and forth lad, That for fer I was nyh mad, And knew nat what was best to do; But, amyd off al my wo, I sawh a wekke, Old and hydous, Off look and cher ryht monstrous, Pyled and seynt as any kaat, And moosy-heryd as a raat. And thys wekke (as I was war) Vnder hyr Arm, an Ax she bar, Lych a bocher that wyl slen Grete bestys, and affter ffleen, And sythen put hem to larder. Lyk swych a womman was hyr cher; ffor bestys at ther ffeet be-hynde, With a corde she dyd√´ bynde, And cordys ek (as I was war) Gret plente, on hyr Arm she bar, And affter, with hyr own√´ hond, Strongly by the ffeet me bond; In the knotte ther was no lak; And thann√´ thus to hyr I spak: Pilgrym ‚ÄúO, thow Old√´ Ryvelede whyht! ffoul and owgly off thy syht! Why artow, off thy cruelte, Kome vnwarly thus on me, ffals, and a traytour in werkyng, And spak no word in thy komyng?

But while that I, in my pass√°ge, Byheelde the see, sterne and sav√°ge, Me thought I sawe bysyd√´ me, That there stood a green√´ tre; And I was glad alle thilk√´ while, Wenynge there hadde ben an yle, In hop√´ that I schuld√´ londe, Hastely, vp at som stronde, Whiche was to me fful greet plesaunce. And as I gan my silffe avaunce, And thederward gan ffast√´ hye, Anoon my sylffe I dyde aspye (Whanne that I gan lok√´ wel) That I was caste vp-on a whel, Off whiche to-fforne I sawgh no thynge; ffor the ffloodes, in ther fflowynge, Hadde with his waw√´s euerydel Ouere-fflowyd so that whel, That I toke no heede there-at, Tyl sodeynely there-on I sat.

And I dem√´d, in certeyne, That this tre hadd√´ hoolys tweyne; And on the hygher hoole aloffte, I sawe an hand putte out fful offte. And this hand (as to my look) To the nestis put up an hook, And (as to myne inspeccyoun) Was besy to pulle the nestis doun.

And there I sawe a lady stonde Amonge the wyld√´ wawys trowble, Vp-on a whel dyuerse and dowble. Departyd was her garnemente, Halffe hool, and haluendel was rente; The to party, as snow was white To loke vp-on, off greet delyte; The tother party (√°s thought me) Was ffoule and owgely on to se. And hir vysage eke also Was departyd euene a two; The to party was amyable, And to byhold√´ d√©lytable, Bothe off porte and off manere, Glad and lawynge off hir chere; The tother syde, hydous and old, Whiche was ryuelyd many ffold; And on hir schuldres rownd and square, A crokyd staffe in sothe sche bare. And whanne I gan al this aduerte, Dyscomff√≥rtyd in myn herte Thanne was I, greetly agaste; And my burdoun I heelde ryghte ffaste, And dyde also greetly my peyne To grype it with myne hand√´s tweyne; And seyde, (off sodeyne moscyoun,) ‚ÄúBordoun,‚Äù quod I, ‚Äúbordoun, bordoun!

And whyl I lay thus in A trance, In gret Anoy and p√©rturbaunce, I herde a voys mellodyus, Wonder soote and gracyous, Wych was to me ful gret plesaunce; ffor I forgat al my grevaunce, My dool and al my pass√Øoun, Wyth mellodye off thylk√´ soun.

But when they were come home agayne, and enteryd in-to the castell, it lyked me ryght wonder well. a-non I went to his presens, and tolde hym of the gret offens whiche that Scilla with hir hounds had don to me within his bounds, by the conspirac√Øon of Envy and [of] Treason: my wrong I dyd specifye. the kynge a-non let make a crye, that were-so-evar they myght be found in towne or in citie, that folk√´ shuld them spar√´ nought, to his presens till they were brought. for he cast hym, anone ryght, on them to done iustice and ryght, that they go no more at large; and gave his porter eke in charge forto shette the gat√´s sore, that they entre there no more, nor that they have ther no chere. and then I saughe a messagere wher the kynge of custome dwells, In the castell ryng√´ bells, for to maken √°ssembl√©, where the kynge set in his se, of the ladyes that ther dwell, (of whome to-forne ye have herd tell,) that suffred gret oppressyon of Envy and Detracc√Øon, of Scillas hound√´s, by berkynge, in th[e] absens of the kynge, of their drede and mortall rage, wher-of they suffred gret damage. ‚ÄòMadams,‚Äô quod this messegere, ‚Äòthe kynge, most myghty of power, whiche hathe, in great charitie, (in effecte, as ye shall se,) and purposethe in his entent, he hathe be longe from yow absent, (as ye know yowr-selffe full well,) but of new, to this castell, he is come for his pleasaunce; and he hathe made an ordynaunce and statut√´s full coven√°ble, to yow echon ryght profytable, commaundynge yow, echon, in dede, that, hens-forthe, ye ha no drede of your enemys, nor hevynesse, but that yow do yowr besynesse (as it is the kyng√´s will) yowr office truly to fulffyll, ‚Äòas ye dyd, when ye began, and bettar, yf ye bettar can; for the kynge (as ye shall se) will on your foon avengid be: to yow I ha no more to say.‚Äô than the messengar went his way, and thes ladys, by good advyse, full truly dyd theyr offyse, evereche, lyke to ther degre, voyde of all contrariouste; and (shortly for to devyse) wher that truth√´ and iustice be truly kept in any place, I dare sayne ther abydythe grace; And where the gat√´ is kept well, of palays, maner, or castell, that vycis may ha none entrie, that place stant in su√´rte, and eche thynge tournethe for the best; for, ther is peace, and ther is rest, and evar gladly, to theyr forthynge, ther abyte the ryghtffull kynge; and ther is suraunce &amp; eke trust. and afftar this, I had a lust, cawght in my-selfe a great corage, for to holden my passage, and greatly gan my selffe delyght, dyvers castells to vysyte, for to consythar the maner of euery maner offycer, How euerych dede in his degre. and it is good, a man to se many thyng√´s, and to here, for therby a man may lere ful moche thynge outward by syght, and take example to done right. And whan I hadde ther-to lycence I wente and dede my diligence to visiten, and to se ful many wonderful countre. and ther I fond ful gret foysoun Of many dyuers Religyoun; and I saugh, of many oon, The gret√´ bond√´s euerychon broke, that shuld hem wel conserve, yef they wold hem wel observe, Kepe hem from al aduersite, as here-to-forn ye ded√´ se, Whan the smale wikres brak, The hop√´s wenten al to wrak, And many shippes for lak, allas, Was yperysshed in the same cas, and brought vnto confus√Øoun, (toforn as is maad mens√Øoun) for lak in their gouernaunces, Nat kepyng their obseruaunces.

Wherfore the Spon that thou hast seyn? ys callede ‚ÄòSyngularyte,‚Äô thyng to possede in propurte; to gedre the fatt√´ (thus I mene,) vnto hir self, and leve the lene: As the Prophete Ezechiel, to the sheperdes of Israel Spak and wrot, ful yore a-go: ‚ÄòSorwe be to you, and wo, that ne take to nothyng hede, but your silven forto fede; not lik sheperdes of cristus hous; but verray wolv√´s Ravinous, liggyng awayt, bothe nyght and day, forto devoure what thei may: they tak√´ both√´ mylk and wolle; and the fatte, away thei pulle with the spoon of cruelte ycalled Syngularyte, thei Robb√´ pantener and purs, and gete hem oft√´ Cristes cours. ‚Äòffor which cause, I, Abus√Øoun, √°m come of entenc√Øoun ‚ÄòSuch abus√Øouns to se, and their superfluyte to kutte away, which that thei vse, and their goodes to √°menuse. ‚ÄòThe Aungels han hem take away, Which thou mettest this same day, With gret√´ somers in sothnesse, ledyng away the gret Richesse, to parte it (of entenc√Øoun) to folk that in deuoc√Øoun lede her liv√´s in comune, and in deuocioun do contune; such as in god gretly delyte, fro good to bet alway profyte. ‚Äòfigure herof, ye may se, how that by olde Antiquyte, the bible ful wel can you tel, how the childre of Israel took of Egypt the Tresour In recompense of her labour.

It not appereth, her nor there, the hoot√´ Sonne maketh hem Sere; Ther colours and their fressh aray, al ys tourned into hay. ‚Äòand, thou, that so long√´ be Grene and lusty forto se, Deth (his power for to kythe,) wil abatyn with his sythe thy grenesse, and ek also parten th√® on peces two, The soule, the body, her and yonder, and maken hem to parte assondre. for, playnly, as thou shalt lere, they may, as now, not gon yfere; the soul√´ must√´ go tofore, and the body shal be bore, ‚ÄòIn erthe to haue his mans√Øoun, and tourn√´ to corrupc√Øoun; and afterward, be wel certeyn, Ioyned with the soule ageyn, and ben to-gidre eternally. ‚ÄòNow loke that thou be ful redy; for yf ther be no lak in the, thou shalt go streyht to the cyte Of the kyngdom and the Rewm that called ys Ierusalem, to which thy pilgremage was sette. ‚Äòthou art come to the wyket (Which is gynnyng of thy labour,) thow beheld in a myrrour, whan thow were ful tendre of age, at gynnyng of thy pilgrymage; and therfor now thou art sette at the boundes of the wyket, I consaille the, first to crye Vnto my Fadre for mercye, behotyng the lady dame Penaunce, yef thou ha not in suffisaunce Don to her, whil thou wer here, Iustly and truely thy devere; thou art in wil, at thy partyng, thorugh grace and mercy of the kyng, that Regneth eternally in glorye, It to fulfille in purgatorye; ther tabiden in that place, tyll the lord wil do th√® grace, of his mercy, at the laste.‚Äô And, for the tym√´ cam on faste, and my spech√´ gan to faille, I thoughte it fooly for tasaille Grac√´ dieu with quest√Øouns, with demand√´s or resouns. And (as I coude ek wel discerne) Deth abood at the posterne, and gan to let√´ goon his sythe, his cruel myght on me to kythe, And gan so streytly me coharte, That the soul√´ mot departe. And, such a feer anoon me took, Out of my slep that I a-wook.</field>
