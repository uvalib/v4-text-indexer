      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Truely Vertuous and Beautifull Gentlewomam: Mrs. ELIZABETH CROMPTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Glory of Women, or a Looking Glasse for Ladies. The Lord of Glory, and the King of Kings, That framed Heaven, and terrestriall things, In his own likeness did he form the creature, Both male and female, in a comely feature; They differ only in their situation, And that ariseth from the generation: But certainly, to each he did inspire Souls uniform, with one celestiall fire: Nor can the male a greater licence claime Then doth the female, they are both the same: Boths operations, and indevours are, In blessedness to have an equall share. The rule divine will quickly make it clear, That Saints in glory change their callings, there In stead of mortalls toyling on the earth, They act as Angels, in the second birth: Hence from the souls no honour doth exceed Greater in males, then in the female breed: No doubt of this, nor scruple can arise, Because their glory God did equalize; Yet many times in point of operation, The soules of females are the best in fashion: They far excell the zealous deeds of men To true devotion none so prone as them; The which (in time to come) shall surely be Divulged to them in felicity. But to proceed, the scope whereat I aime, By learned Authors, is to prove the same: Passing the speeches of a feigned heart Or people learned in the Logick Art, By whose inchantments, the unskilfull are Often bewitch'd and tangled in a snare: But by the judgements of the sage and wise, And Authors speaking truth in Histories, By reasons firm grounded on natures cause, By holy Rules, Divine and Humane Lawes, To shew that females doe as far exceed The males, as Lillies doe the grossest weed. Then first of all, to speak of womans fame, She is adorned with a noble name. Poor Adam from vile earth his name derives, But Eve denoteth things inspir'd with lives: But how much better life then death we deem, So much the greater doth the female seem: Let none exclaime, nor stile the sentence weak, Because in prayse of womens names we speak. Did not the founder of the earth below, Long time before he made us, truly know Why he did form us, also to what end Our Muses center, and our thoughts depend? Therefore unto each kind of sexe he gave Those names dissonant which the sexes have: Hence it arises, and the use is known, By'th proper name each man doth call his own: That this is true, and to maintain the cause, It is apparant in the Roman Lawes, Divines and Lawyers, men of great renown Esteem a title as an earthly crown. The name of Nabal did his person fit, It stiles him foolish, he was voyd of wit. This maketh the Apostle Paul to cry, (Speaking of Christ, and of his dignity) Hee's better then the Angels far away; For he has gain'd a better name then they. Again, he said who certainly did know, To th'name of Jesus every knee shall bow: So rare a title unto him was given, As that it stiles him Lord of Earth and Heaven; So then the obligations of the words Great potency to the Lawes affords, Both in condition and signification, Or any such like kinds of disputation, Which is extracted from the head and line Of both the Law rules, Humane and Divine; Yea by the Law, from titles we descry The force of words and Etymology, With reasons of that figure, and the order Of rightly placing words each in his border: The Civill Lawes will very gravely scan, And gather reasons from the names of man. Cyprian speaking of the first mans name, Sayes, from the corners of the world it came; And in his Works hee'l plainly make't appear, He so expoundeth Adams title there, And proves his speeches with a reason good, (Saith he) earths turned into flesh and blood: Though this doth differ from the legall way, And from the rule of Moses, yet I say Cause here the name has letters four you see, And in the Hebrew it can claim but three: Yet you in conscience have no cause to blame The man expounding such a secret name: Though he's unlearned in the Hebrew tongue, So's many more, which holy Laws do wrong. If such a licence then were granted me, Of Eve I'd frame an Etymologie, The which should tend unto the Females praise, Then give me leave this argument to raise, Derived from those symbals mysticall Of Cabilists, in little time I shall Declare, that Females have more dignity, And can (by right) claim more affinity To that four-lettr'd name, rare and Divine, O Feminine! the greater part is thine; Mans name and that are often cut asunder, In form, and fashion, and in troop, and number: But these will ask a larger time to plead Then suits with us, therefore we'l only read And wave th? by, although we know th'are sure, Yet read by few, and understood by fewer: But we will search into the female kind, By reall works their dignities to find; Into the rule of Scripture will we look, And scan the Volums of the Sacred Book: Then for to prove it, I'le do what I can, That they have gain'd a better fame then man: Then in the product let us learn to know That things in Heaven, and the earth below, Differ in order and nobility, The one stands firme to all eternity; Nor is it prone to any grosse infection, 'Twas so ordain'd at the first Election: The next, because its carnall, needs it must Indulge it selfe, in crimes of earthly lust: In forming which, the Maker did proceed, First to the purest, as the purer deed; But he did finish all the latter kind With all the purest that was left behind: And thats the reason why the Lord began With holy soules, before he formed man; For learn'd Augustine this thing strives to prove That Adams soule did with the Angels move; Before their Corps were fram'd in human shape, Our parents souls the Almighty did create. Things incorrupt made by Jehovah were, As Stars, and Planets hanging in the Ayre: The Chrystalline, the primum mobile, Are not corrupted with such dregs as we: Although 'tis known unto each vulgar notion That Heaven differs in its dayly motion. Then did he draw from that more noble seed Those earthly bodies, which corruption breed; But first he formed all the vile and worse, And with the best, made up the Universe: First Mineralls were made, then Plants and Trees, Then Sensitives were framed by degrees: Some walk, some creep, &amp; others mount on high, But swimming creatures in the water lie: Then did he make the glory of the rest, First male, then female, but the female best, In whom the fulnesse of the earth resides, Nay Heavens brightnesse in her face abides: She is most noble and divine, therefore In her God rested from creating more. She doth include the forme of the Creator, Yea fame, and beauty, and the strength of nature. Oh then! search where you can, you'l never see, One half so famous as the females be, Because she was brought last into the Land, She's the perfection of Jehovahs hand. Who then denies (to speak in humane sence,) That females have the best preheminence? Were they but absent all the world should know The work thats perfect would to nothing go: If they were absent, all the people soon Would dearly want them, as the sun and moon: Who so doth think in thinking is too blame, That God would end in an unperfect frame. For since the building of the world begun, Since Heavens circuit round about hath run, It was the use, that all the former kind Should with the last be coupled and conjoyn'd; So women were last in humanity, But yet the first of all in dignity: The Prophet sayes, that woman was elected Before the Earth and Heavens were effected. Among the wise tis an authentick rule, And 'tis approv'd in Plato's Ethick School, That each mans end by him was first intended, And yet the last, the last of all thats ended: But Woman is the crown of the Creation, Brought in by God, and placed in the Nation, Yea Queen and glory of that pallace rare, Which for her self Jehovah did prepare, Trim'd and adorn'd, meet to entertain The noble bodies of that comely train; Nay more then this, each living Creature shall Acknowledge her to be the Generall. The Wise man says, (but not in vain we see) God has enrich't her with nobility. Shees better too, by reason of the place Where she was formed; but to clear the case, The holy Scriptures plainly restifie The worth and value of her dignity: For she was formed in that holy ground, The which with sacred Angels did abound, When as poor man, which must to woman yield, Had his beginning in the open field: He with four footed beasts first took his rise, And then was turned into Paradice: So that by right, Woman's the best of things, And placed higher then the reach of Kings: Whence looking down her eyes are never dim, Should man be so, 'twould quickly dazle him. An other help 'bove Males, the Females have, If both together fall into the wave, And see no succour, shelter, tree, or Town, The Female swimmeth, but the man sinks down. It is most surely known by all the Laws, That man his honour from the Country draws; Where first of all in humane shape he came, The place more noble, brings the greater fame. Nay, 'tis observed of the Creatures all, And 'tis confirm'd by men in generall: By how much better was the soile, that they Took their first breath in, so much more (I say) Are they esteemed generous to be, And counted rich in humane dignity: Therefore doth Isaac give his son command He should not marry from Canaan Land: But take a wife from sacred Syria, Or from the Land Mesopotamia: To prov this point, more Scriptures could I bring But this sufficeth, and will clear the thing. She's far more rare then man, by reason she Is not a substance so impure as he; 'Tis not vile drosse that caus'd her timely birth, Nor yet the substance of polluted earth; She's purifi'd, like silver thrice refin'd, And then inspired with a heav'nly mind: But man was made of earth and ashes, then Are not the women far more rare then men? Poor man (alas) was made of such a nature, Which can alone produce each living creature: But woman only is Jehovahs skill, Intire, and holy, she remaineth still: Man losing one, and yet no more then one Did form the woman of his single bone: He lost that Rib as on the ground he lay, Nor did he know when it was stoln away; Therefore the man is but the work of Nature, But woman is the print of the Creator: She's full of Beauty to inrich her fame, She's often found abounding with the same; This will appear within her cheeks to lie, Excelling man in her serenitie; Since Beauty then is nothing but the light, And splendor shining in each body bright: Then certainly Females the Lord did chuse To fill with it, when man he did refuse. But that I might them more illuminate, I'le shew their bodies are most delicate, In form, and colour, which for to behold, Shines far more bright then the refined Gold: Her locks are comely, and her head's most clear, And it's adorned with her silken haire; Her aspects lovely, glancing from her face, Her forehead high, for beauty doth surpasse; Her twinckling eyes plac't in their silver cases, Are mixt and blended with ten thousand graces; 'Bove which there hang the curtains of her eyes, And in the midst there doth her nose arise, Plac't like a ballance, or an even weight Descending downwards by a comly height: Next unto this is made her mouth below, Surrounded with those Ruby Lips that grow In decent order, shining bright and clear, And when she smiles, her candid teeth appear, Both sharp and small, and placed equally, Th'are far more bright then bones of Ivory; They rest within the cheeks that do inclose Both red and white, the Lilly and the Rose; Behold her chin made Conojodicall, Her neck beneath is placed long and small, Erected neatly on her shoulders round; Her throat but slender, yields a pleasant sound: Her breasts adorn'd, her paps with Nectar fill'd, Which dulcid drink she doth to infants yield: Her belly's round, back small, sides soft &amp; tender; Her arms erect, her hands are thin and slender: Her feet divide it neatly, and her hips Are trimm'd with fatnesse; but her finger tips End all compleatly, in a circle round: Each part with sanguine moisture doth abound. Then next of all, observe but how she goes, And how she trips it on her nimble toes, Handsome in motion, and in manners gay, So decently, that I may truly say, There is no creature lives the Heavens under, That's halfe so famous, or so great a wonder. All eyes may see (if not depriv'd of sight) That God has heaped in their bodies bright, All shining lustre in the earthy Land, Whereat all creatures else amazed stand: The spirits too, whose dwellings are above, Unto the Females bear an ardent love. I'le not omit what Poets do declare, What love betwixt the gods and Women are, Apollo's Daphne, Neptune's fair Salmon, And Hercules among the rest had one, With many more of the superiour powers, That were enamour'd with their Paramours. The sacred Scripture doth in many places, Praise Womens beauty as their gifts and graces: Read but in Genesis, and you shall find, The sons of men beheld the Women kind, That they were fair and comely to behold, Each took a Wife the fairest that he could. We read that Sarah was so bright and faire, As none with her was able to compare. When Abra'ms servant had Rebecka view'd, He did not tell to all the multitude The knowledge of his mind, yet well knew he That she was chosen Isaac's spouse to be. But we'le proceed to zealous Abigal, The wise and prudent wife of base Naball: She was indeed a most laborious Wife; She sav'd her riches, and her husbands life; To whom reply'd the King, Depart in peace, For I have heard thee, and ador'd thy face, Since beauty is divine and temporall, It was in her wholly corporeall; Divine likewise, mixt with a tender spirit, Her eloquence did Davids favour merit, Insomuch as when Nabals life was fled, David it seemeth did the woman wed. Bathsheba did in beauty much excell, And that's the reason David lov'd her well; Nay, when her husband was deceased, he Extoll'd her with a Queenly dignitie; Because Abishag was a Virgin faire, The Royal King in old age did not spare: But she was chosen with the King to lie, Who fetcht his heat a good recovery; For which the King enricht her with his grace, And when he di'd she raigned in his place: We read of Beauty much in Vashty Queen, But Hester was more comely to be seen. We read of such as on fair Judith gaz'd, Were forthwith struck with terrour and amaz'd; Nor was Susannah more exempt then she, Her beauty ravished exceedinglie. We read of Job, when all his woes were past, God gave him three fair Daughters at the last, Whose shining lustre in their sanguine faces Was far more glorious then the threefold graces: In all the circle and superficies There was not found more comely Dames then these: Should ye but read the Virgins Histories, They'd seem more bright &amp; clearer in your eyes Then we can shew, nor can we but admire Their pleasant beauty with th'Idilean fire: But more then all, our blessed Saviours Mother, In beauty, grace, and truth, excels all other: The Sun, and Moon, cannot but blush to see Her pious life, and chaste Virginitie: Such colours were within her cheeks conjoynd, That might have turned every mortall mind; Yet unto sin her thoughts could not consent, Her holy heart and zeale were never bent To lust, to joyn with man it was her hate, Or man with her for to adulterate. These are set down in holy Scripture, where By often speaking, I have made it cleer That womans beauty God hath laid upon her, Which he esteems, and every one must honour, In holy Writ, it is most cleer and plain, That all the Males, as soon as born were slain: But all the Paragons born in the Land Were kept alive, it was the Lords command: The Israelits permitted to chuse The fairest women of the captive Jewes; Besides all these approved truths, there be More grounded reasons resting secretlie In Women, which I never will reveale, Cause none shall say I did contend to steale My proofs, &amp; patch them with I know nor what To make it large, speak therefore will I not; We have enough of them, desist I will, And leave such secrets to anothers quill. Then furthermore, if it required be, Nature hath lent Females much modestie: They oftentimes are plagu'd with dangerous Sores in the secrets, called Ulcerous; And yet would rather unto death submit, Then to be cur'd by the Chyrurgions wit: This grace of modesty they dying have, And also dead, if perish'd in the wave: For Pliny writes of man, and testifies, That being drown'd, his fore part upward lies: But nature sparing women more then him, Hath turn'd her belly downwards for to swim; To these I adde the mans most noble part, The head, the which includes all humane Art, By w?? w'are known fr? speechles bruits to vary From w?? proceeds each thought &amp; act primary, This many times with baldnesse is deform'd, But Women keep what nature hath adorn'd; Besides the which in each mans face appears A beard extending upwards to his ears, Which hides the lustre of his brawny face, Because it riseth up in beauties place, But every female beardles doth remaine, But old and yong her face is still the same. Hence was it graven the Law Tables in, That women should not shave their tender skin, Lest that a hairy bush should chance to bud, And spoyle the sanguine colours of their bloud. Here's one thing more thats worth your observation If women once be cleansed by lavation, Although she dips again in waters clear, From her white hands no soylings will appear: Should man do so, let him be ne're so ruddy, He would convert clear water unto muddy. But here Ile wave mine Authour for a while, Not that I would him of his works beguile; But only this I say, such things as these Must not be pleaded in the Common pleas: If any them to know desirous be, Let him read Volumes of Philosophy, The which in reading he will soon descry The Female sex, and their nobility. Much could I speak of every Female creature, But why should I disclose the depths of nature? I will forbear them, and return again To matters holy, leaving the prophane. Females abound with more compassion, Then men, 'tis spoken by King Solomon, For where there wants a female sex to cherish The sick mans woes, the sick for grief doth perish For by her presence and dexterity, Or from her breasts is found a remedy; Yea, she by her sweet Aromatick breath Restores to life men halfe possest with death; To witnesse David chose the Shunamite To cherish and imbrace his corps at night. But here Ile raise them with a greater lift, That's by declaring their more noble gift; The speech that vast incomprehended measure, Which Hesiod cals her chiefest wealth &amp; treasure Now doth not Woman with her nimble tongue, And words revenge her unrevenged wrong. Is't not from Mother, or the Nurse we draw, And learn the Science of the speaking Law: 'Twas natures pleasure to accommodate Women with speeches most immaculate; So that in thousands you shall scarcely find One dumb or speechlesse of the Female kind: Is't not a glorious thing so to excell In speeches as to have no parallel; As man excels the silent beasts, so she Exceeds the man in tongues agility. But waving by these things of lesse account, We'le clime into a more religious mount, And then each rule in order will we take, God blessed man, yet man for womans sake; Nor was the man thought fit to be instated In this, before the woman was created: To which agrees the Proverb of the King, Who findeth vertue finds a precious thing In woman, yea, who ever doth afford Such vertue, draws a blessing from the Lord. Again tis said that such a one is blest Whose Wife is good, yea his years are increast, No man with him is able to compare, Whose chance it is with such a one to share. Again 'tis spoken in the selfe same case, That womens vertue is the chiefest grace. King Solomon most noble for renown, Saies of the Male the Female is the crown. That solid and laborious Preacher Paul, The glory of the man doth woman call. You know that glory is the finall end, Beyond the which there's nothing can extend: No strength nor might is able for to yield The meanest Flower to this glorious field: Therefore the woman is the full perfection, The glory, honour, and the benediction Of man: Augustine saies the first society That man received in this mortallity: Then is't not meet, because she's mans elect, That each should love, and yield her due respect: Who doth not so, doth natures course deny, And also vary from humanity: Here might I bring more myst'ries then the rest, How Abraham, by Sarahs name was blest: The Letter H. from Sarah was deriven Which drew a mighty blessing down fr? heav?; For being joyned with her husbands name, Instead of Abram, stiles him Abraham: And Jacob here comes in among the other, Who gain'd his blessing by his prudent mother: There's many more that Scripture makes appear, But we'l desist, we will not name them here: It is apparent by the words I spake, That man was blessed but for womans sake: 'Tis true, that man gain'd by his sinfull cause, The furious Precepts, and the ridged Lawes; Man was charg'd by the Divine Decree, He should not touch the good and evill tree: 'Twas man alone to whom the charge was said, So't must needs be so, for woman was not made: Therefore 'twas man, and man alone did sin, By reason that the charge was made to him: So then we drew (if Scripture we'l believe) Our former sins from Adam, not from Eve: Therefore the Law among the people rose That every Male-child should his fore-skin lose; 'Twas not for eating, God did Eve accuse, But that she did not Sathans tempts refuse; Not that the crime by woman was began, But as she gave occasion to the man: She first was snared in the Devils wile, And thus deceiv'd strove others to beguile: Poor Adam to his knowledge did transgresse, So did not Eve, which makes her sin the lesse: Satan cast woman with an envious fall, Because of creatures she's the best of all: Saint Bernard saith, the Devill did admire To see her face, her beauty hatch'd a fire In Satans brest, which suddainly arose Just like the burnings which the Bellows blows: And whilst he stood, he did in envy swell, Because that Eve in honour did excell: This was the cause that Christ our only Saviour Came into humane shape with mild behaviour: So that he might our crimes eradicate, He took upon him sinfull mans estate: Moreover we were blamed for the fall Of man, 'tis truly known in generall: Therefore God willed that this burning flame Might quenched be by those from which it came, And that the Sex deluded by deceit Might pay the grand deluder for his cheat: Hence it is spoken of the Serpents breed, They shall be bruised by the womans seed: So is it that the order of the Priest Was chose in man, which representeth Christ: Wherefore God will'd our Saviour to come Not of the man, but from the woman, whom He so far grac't, that from her body he Extracted Christ into humanitie: This is the great incomprehended phrase That strikes the holy Prophet in a maze, To see that man was born of woman kind, And yet this woman not with man conjoyn'd: Nay, when our Saviour rose from death to light, He first appeared in the womans sight, And not in mans, who after Christ was dead, Fell off from faith, and from Religion fled: But it is known that noble women stood Holding Religion solid, firm, and good. But furthermore, no sinfull heresies, No errour from the women did arise; When as by men our Saviour was abused, Sold, bought, betrai'd, condemned, and accused: By man his just and harmless cause was tri'd, By man he suffer'd, and was crucifi'd: Peter denies him, none at all there was, But only women with him at the Crosse: The Heathnish Frow Nefarious Pilats Wife, More then Disciples strove to save his life: 'Tis an authentick censure of Divines That Christian truth remain'd not in the mindes Of faithless men, it was imbrac't by no man, 'Twas only kept and cherisht by a woman, The blessed Virgin Mary, whence arose The name that Females were religious: Now he that cries men are most wise and strong, I'le bid him hold his multiloquious tongue: Then give me leave with blessed Paul to speak That God hath chose the foolish things, &amp; weak To quell the wise, yea brittle things are chose As instruments, the stronger to oppose: Things out of date, in secret holes laid by, Are us'd the high and mighty to destroy: For none so pure as Adam, yet alas, The man converted by a woman was. Was not great Sampson stronger then the rest? Yet by Dalilah was his strength deprest: What man more chaste then Lor, more mild or just? Yet did not woman tice him unto lust: What mortall man (I pray) hath ever bin More just then David? yet did he not sin For womans sake? King Solomon the Great Was meerly snared by the females cheat: Among Disciples Peter did excell, Yet by a womans pollicy he fell To swearing, and with horrid Oaths to curse, Nay unto Christ deniall which is worse: Were it but lawfull that I might compare Our Saviour with the rest, I would not spare: Did he not suffer to be overcome? By that most faithfull woman, unto whom He said, O woman! 'tis not meet, nor good That Dogs should have the little childrens food: But she replies, yea Lord the Dogs may eat The crums dejected from their Masters meat: Now be it spoke with fear and reverence If she went not the conquerer from thence: Let Canonists say what they will, yet they In point of truth have err'd and gone astray: Their government was turn'd and overthrown, They were deluded by the Popish Joan: But if by chance one saith these speeches tend To woman shame, then shall my fancy lend This borrowed Phrase; if by necessitie The one of us must lose our goods or die; Ile rather seek his plots to overthrow, Then yield a slave to mine insulting foe: The civill Laws do carefully provide That womens causes may with ease be tri'd, Although to man the same cause cannot be Pleaded without losse and intricacy: And many times the holy Scriptures tell That womans sins mans duties do excell. Rachel was prais'd because 'twas her intent To cheat her father, for she did invent A cunning plot, from Laban to remove Those Idols, odious to the Gods above. Is not Rebecka glorifi'd? 'cause she Won Jacobs blessing by her policy. The Harlot Rahab was accounted wise, 'Cause by deceit she saved Israels spies. When Iaell went proud Sisera to meet, She first with friendly speeches did him greet: She gave him water as he did require, And all things else to fill his vast desire: She did pretend in safety him to keep, But yet she kil'd him after faln asleep: Though she was guilty of this homicide, Yet with the woman she was glorifi'd: Mark what Judith to Holofernes said, Take thou the counsell of thy trusty Maid; Observe my speeches, and advised bee, I'le keep thee safely, and reveale to thee The wicked projects of malicious men, And then I'le bring thee through Jerusalem: Then as a shepheard shalt thou rule and guide The sheep of Israel, that they not slide: O Holofernes I bend thine ear and hark, Thy Maker saies, no whining Dog shall bark Against thine honour, none shall give offence, This was reveal'd to me by providence: Thus was he lull'd in her deceitfull bed Asleep, then she depriv'd him of his head: Pray what more bloudy or base treacheries? What sordid plots were acted worse then these? Yet was not Judith magnifi'd; therefore 'Tis manifest, that womens crimes are more Reputed, praised, and esteemed then The zealous duties of the sons of men: Did Cain attempt by firstlings to make triall To win Gods love, and yet receiv'd deniall? His sacrifice, and gifts were not accepted, For all his zeale yet Cain was disrespected: Did Esau sin in seeking for reliefe T'asswage his weak decrepit fathers griefe? This very cause wrought the Almighties hate, Nor was poor Esau then immaculate: And zealous Uzzah reaching forth his hand To stay the Ark which tott'ringly did stand; Did it with zeale, but as he toucht the side, He was ta'n breathless, and forthwith he di'd: Nor was King Saul exempted rather then The meanest, or the poorest sort of men: I say that he because he was not wise Enough to give the fairest sacrifice; Instead of Crown and Kingdom did inherit The bitter torments of an evill spirit: Lots wanton Daughters were excused rather From sinfull incest, then their drunken father: Incestuous Tamar was accounted just, When sinfull Judah was accus'd of lust: Nor was her line thought too too mean, to be The reall Line of Christs Nativity. Go now ye stout, and the pragmatick ones, Ye Lads of Pallas, and the Muses Sonnes; Depart, I say, seek for Poetick ayd, Yet still the man is in his sins betrayd: Yea sure I am, that all your Logick stories, And all the force of your blind Allegories Will never prove that mans authority Is equall unto womans dignity: But let's return to this great Argument, The blessed Virgin, and most excellent Mary most noble, and divine, whom in (As some affirm) there was not Adams sin: Of all the women Mary was the best; But of the men, Saint John exceeds the rest: Now by how much Mary doth him exceed, So much the greater is the Female breed: But as we speak of these, so may we do Of the more base, and the inferiour crew; We shall affirm, and truly say that some men Are far more wicked then the worst of women, To witnesse Judas, for whose cursed death, He might have wisht, would he had ne'r drawn breath: Or Antichrist that grand deluding evil, In whom remains the power of the Devill. We read of men condemned for to lie In hellish flames to all eternity, And yet we find not in the holy Writ, One woman cast in that infernall pit. But furthermore, from Birds I shall derive The female Sexes great prerogative: You know the Eagle of the Birds is Queen, Yet only Females, never Males are seen. The men of Wisdome of the Phœnix say, That she's a Female in Arabia. The Basilisk, that most infectious thing, Of poysonous creatures is accounted King, Yet he injoyes not any female mate, In his uncleanesse to participate. What shall I say more for the feminines? Did not we draw our sin from Adams lines? Did he not sin in daring to withstand, And to rebell against the Lords command? He did unlock those Heaven gates from whence He drew the wrath of Gods Omnipotence. His first begotten in like manner fell, For he unlockt the fiery gates of Hell: He was the first that acted homicide, First desperate and envious paricide: Man first invented such ungodly lives, As Lamech, sporting with his various wives. First drunkenesse by Noah was begun, And that discover'd by his evill son. Nimrod invented vain idolatry, And then proceeded in vile tyranny. Man first was tempted to adultery, And learnt the secrets of black Tartary. The Sons of Jacob did not spare to sell Their brother though his father lov'd him well. Nought would appease proud Pharaoh's angry mood Til he had spilt the little childrens blood. So was Gomorrah, and vile Sodom's Town, For mens iniquities both burned down. We read of men, that in abundant measure, Had many Wives, for their lascivious pleasure: And such were Lamech, Jacob, Abraham, Abria, Joseph, and great Roboham; Sampson, prophaning Esau, (Isaac's Son) Moses, King Ashur, and King Solomon, Saul, and Helcana, their lascivious lines Were not content with sundry Concubines: For these would not their lustfull stomacks fill Till they had us'd their hand-maids at their will: And yet you know, 'mong women there is none But what were pleased with one man alone, Except Bathsheba, and you shall not find Two husbands wedded to a woman kind: The women greatly do abstain from men, By reason they are not so bold as them: They have appoynted strangers in their beds, To stand as helpers in their husbands steds: Sarah and Rachel sent their Maids to lie In their own beds t'inlarge Posterity: But man would seldome yield that any should Raise seed for him, although himselfe was old: Whol clouds of wom? could I bring, whose fame In wedlock won them an eternall name: As Abigall, and Artemesia. And she so modest called Argia, And constant Portia, with Messalina, Romane Lucretia, Dido, Sulpitia, With many more (which if I should rehearse They'd fill whole Volums of Heroick Verse) Whose twisted knots of choice Virginitie, Grim death nor wedlock never could untie: Examples more, as Calidonia, Camilla, Volsca, Iphygenia, To which I adde Lacedemonian, With Spartan Ladies, and Milesian Virgins, but read thou Greeks and Hebrews o're, Then of this sort you'l find a thousand more. But now for piety, if one demand, Here's an example ready at my hand, The Vestall Virgin Claudia, of whom 'tis said Her pious Acts excell that Plebean Maid, Whose tender zeale deserves eternall rest, She fed her Mother with her milky brest: But if some Zoylus shall object to these, And say, that women rais'd sad Tragedies By Marriage, as of Sampson, and great Jason, And that most direfull plot of Agamemnon; Then let him look with Linceas eyes about, He'l quickly find the false accused out; He'l see who is the offender, and will prove That 'tis not woman, but the man doth move His zealous wife to sin, and oftentimes To be infected with her husbands crimes: Nay more; they will provoke a patient wife, Till she has ta'n away her husbands life. O tell me then! pray tell me if you can, Where lies that cause, O is it not in man? Hold then thy babling, and refrain to be A stock of laughter to thine enemie: Were it but lawfull for the female train To sit in Throns of Justice, and to raign: Are they not able (do you think) to draw A form, or coppy of a civill Law; Or could not they (as men have done by them) Pen out, and tell the cruel plots of men? Is there not many smooth pretenders found, Each Town with thieves &amp; robbers doth abo?d: So many were there, that the Story saies They chose them Captains in King Davids daies: Hence is't that we can look on neither side, But we see pris'ners kept in Goals, and ti'd, Reserv'd, I say, untill the judge doth come To breath out sentence, good or evill doome: Just as their works, so will their wages be Prepared for them from eternitie: But now instead of such the Females have Found out each pious act, and science grave: Their own effect will quickly manifest That they have ever lov'd Religion best: Observe, I pray you, the terrestriall ball Receives its name from Virgins, and we call The first part Asia, and the second came From the fair Dam'sel Europa by name: The next part was deriv'd from Libia, Epaphus Daughter, named Affrica: But to conclude, the zealous women bee The best in vertue, and in each degree Of morall Ornaments; I say, they can Do greater wonders then the wisest men: Of Feminines, Lactantius testifies How that they were inspir'd with Prophesies: Women (you know) were raised up to cherish Backsliding Israel, that they might not perish: But let us take another fresh review, Let us inspect the holy Laws a new; And see the Scriptures, how they do commend Wise wom?s works fr? w?? the books were p?d Of Judith, Ruth, and Hester, whose great glory Shall never perish, as an Idle story: You know that Abra'm was accounted just, Because in God he did repose his trust; But yet alas, his justice must submit Unto the face of holy Sarahs wit: What ever Sarah saith, make thine advice Attend her counsels, listen to her voyce. Faithfull Rebecka craving of the Lord An Answer, he this wonder did afford: Two Nations are begotten in thy wombe; Two people shall from thine own bowels come: Although the thing be strange Eliah shews, Yet doth Sarepta harken to his News. When Zachary by Gabriel was reprov'd, Trophetick tokens in his wife were mov'd: The Baby leaped in her tender womb, But Gabriel struck Zachariah dumb; The wom? spake these glorious words that tend The blessed Virgin Mary to commend: Oh thou art blest to all eternity, 'Cause thou believedst what God said to thee. You know that Anna (that brave Prophetesse) Did after Simeon was reveal'd) confesse Her selfe to be from the Almighty sent To cherish such, whose thirsty minds were bent To hear, and those which did expect to see Israel redeemed from Captivity. What need I speak of womens duties more, Had not Philip presaging Daughters foure. What shall I say, shall I speak once again, How Christ conferr'd with the Samaritan, He chose the streams of her believing floud, And did refuse Disciples dainty food. Mark her that had the bloudy current, and The faithfull woman of Canaan Land. Is not renown'd Martha's confession sweeter Then those great oaths of Christ-denying Peter? We read of constant Mary Magdalen, Her zealous acts above the reach of men, For she lamented, groaned, wept, and cry'd, Whilest wicked men our Saviour crucifi'd: She carries Oyle, and seeks him round about; She sayes he's risen, but Disciples doubt. Again, I say, Priscilla must advise The great Apollos, be he ne're so wise: What though a Bishop of great honour yet 'Tis no disgrace to learn that Ladies wit? There's multitudes of Women which have won Eternall names by chusing martyrdome. Can we with silence passe the story by, Of her that fear'd not cruell tyranny, Who seeing all her seven sons must sup At deaths black Table, and drink off the cup Of bitternesse, her courage waxed strong, She rather hastens death, then to prolong Her childrens lives, as fondlings use to do; Nay, for Religion she's a Martyr too. What though the Cauldron and the brasen Pot In burning flames are heated seething hot, To boyle her children? yet good woman she Was never moved in her constancy. Did not the daughter of Bavarians King Convert the Lombards unto Christ, and bring Them to his faith? did not Priscilla draw Th'hungarian heathens to the Christian Law? Famous Clotildis, by her noble pranks, Made Christians of Burgundians and Franks. Another woman of a meaner race, Among th'Iberians planted Faith and Grace. There's thousands more, whose sacred deeds have won Millions of people to Religion. But last of all this female Sex doth shine In Orthodox and Offices divine: Both godlines &amp; grace remain unto this day, Which if we look for, well behold we may; But lest we seem them under foot to trample, For every act we'le bring a clear example: Then let us trace their deeds, and we shall find No more of men, then of the women kind: We had brave female Priests, as Cybiles, And others ta'ne from famous goddesses; Minerva's Priest was Hypocaustria, Mera from Venus, Iphygenia Was call'd a Priest, which from Diana came, With more the Bacchanalian frows; by name, Eliades, Bacchæ, and Thyades, Edonides, and Mimalonides, Bassarides; yea many of the Jews, Which you shall find if Scripture you'l peruse. Did not Moses his sacred sister Mary With Aaron pass into the Sanctuary: Although with us the Office is deny'd, Yea ancient Histories have testifi'd, That they in Priest-hood have ascended high, Yet to the top of Aarons Sanctity. These were both many and of great esteem, Yea holy Nuns and Abbesses have been Accounted famous for propheticall Functions, and Offices Leviticall, In Magick too, but whether good or evill, Whether the genius be from God or Devill I meddle not, but say, that of the rest Circes and Media were the chiefe and best: Yea far more cunning, and more excellent, Than he that first did Magick Art invent. Again we'l find their ingenuity, By searching secrets of Philosophy: For which Theano's worthy to be crown'd, And Dama too, who gravely did expound The secret meanings of her fathers Will, She had no equall in the Ethick skill, Here's Diotima, and Aspsia, Zocrates Scholers, and Mantinea, Lastly Plotinus praiseth Gemina, And he extols the wise Amphilea: The Roman people in their Laws Divine, Did much esteem their Learned Katherine; That woman was chiefe Actor on the Stage Of wit, and purest living in that Age: Nor may we passe the glorious deeds of her, The Schollar of that brave Philosopher Longinus; whose super abundant skill Nichomachus wrot with his Greeks mouth'd quill. But let's proceed, (passing the former by) And enter in the Schoole of Poetry: Behold Armesia, and Valeria, Sappho, Lucrea, and Capiola, And some were named Epigrammatists, Famous for Learning, and brave Latinists; The like among us are remaining yet, Although not licensed to improve their wit: But why should I talk of such certainties As these, will not a single word suffice To prove and try without so many lines, The solid depth of womens Disciplines? Do not Grammarians boast of speaking well? Doth not a Nurse in teaching them excell? From whom (I pray) are speeches first began? From mothers? or the wise Grammarian? Did not Cornelia frame that eminent Grecian Speech, both smooth and eloquent? Istrinus mother taught Sylem to speak, And apprehend the Language called Greek: Did not the Children from Colonies brought, Retain the speeches as their mothers taught? Nor would they leav, although compeld to ch?ge Their native Language, in a Nation strange: 'Twas Plato's rule (for so he thought it meet) To chuse a smooth tongu'd woman and discreet, By whose examples every Infant might Learn both to live well, and to speak aright: Are not the Logick and Poetick strains Turn'd, and convinced, by wise womans brains? There is no Cicero so Eloquent, That can withstand a womans argument. What if we seek th'Arithmeticians ground, Are there not many brave Accountants found 'Mongst Females? yea it were a wonder great If man by figures should a woman cheat: What smooth tongu'd singer? what Musiti?s skil Is parallell to womens sharp and shrill Voyces? are not Mathematicks, Divinations, Presaging Prophets, and Prognostications Planted in them? do not we know and see Plain women learned in Astrologie? Socrates was more learned, and more pure Then all men, searching secrets with mature Judgement, (if that Pythyus believe we may) Yet was instructed by Aspasia. If here, among the rest required be, The height and depth of mother Prudency; The Godesses themselves, of women tell, How they for wit and reason do excell: We have examples drawn from Plotina, And from the Queen call'd Amalasuntha: The wife of Scipio, nam'd Emilia, And she in Scripture namely Debora; Who sate upon the Throne, for to decide The Israelitish judgements, and to guide The people, yea by reason of her might She led the Host, (when Barack would not fight) She won the day, and caus'd her foes to yield, She killed some, and drove some from the field: Attalia, we read, for want of Kingly men Raigned, and judged in Jerusalem: Samiramis, the Queen, as it appears Did regulate the people forty years: Candaces, Queene of Ætheopian Land, Did rule the Subjects at their own command, Whose generous works once born, did never die, But are recorded to eternitie. Josephus writes much in his Histories, Of womens actions in Antiquities: Lo Sheba's Queen came from the uttermost Ends of the earth, from the remotest Coast, To hear the wisdome of the Royal King, And she did with her many servants bring; And by the Lords appointment did condemn The chiefest Rulers in Jerusalem: There was another, not unlike to these, Mature in prudence, called Technites; She by the strength of wisdome did propose Uncommon questions, able for to pose King David, and by Gods examples sought To pacifie him, she by Ridles taught Him knowledge, how to judge, and to expound Dark mysteries, and arguments profound: Nor will we passe the deeds of Abigal, And Bathsheba, whose skill did never faile; Th'one sav'd her husband, that he was not slain By Davids wroth, the other did retain King Davids Kingdome, and by wisdome won The Crown of Dignity, for Solomon. But furthermore, to search natures invention, 'Twas Isis, and Minervas chiefe intention: For modelling brave Cities, and each Town, There's many women were of great renown: Simiramis held the great Monarchy Of all the world, ruling with equity: Thomiris, Queen of the Massegerans, Did conquer Cyrus King of Persians, Camilla, Queen of all the Volscians, And Pande, Princesse of the Indians, Amasones, Chias, and Lemmenses, Candaces, Persians, and Phociones; All these were such, whose fame was founded far In private Counsels, and in publick War: In Ancient Books we read of many more That have regain'd their Realms, and did restore Their People, dragged even to the brink Of dissolution, ready for to sink In flouds of griefe, yea womans braveries Have brought them out again from slaveries: Mark well how Jeremy doth Judith praise, When in these words, he to the people saies, Receive Judith, the mark of chastity, And yield to her a living memory: He gives her not for womans imitation Only, but also for mans observation; Such was her carriage, that she overcame The strongest people, and the men of fame: A prudent woman did to Joab goe. And gave to him the head of Davids foe; So that he might himselfe prepare, and arme, To keep the City free from any harme: Another with a mill-stone took the pains To shatter out Abimeleches brains: This bloudy Tyrant did not spare, but slew His harmless brethren next his father too; So she becomes the execution rod, Because he sinn'd against th'Almighty God: So Hester (great Ahashuerus Wife) Not only sav'd her fading peoples life, But did inrich them with mighty honour, Such was the prudence that was put upon her. When Romes brave City was invironed By Volscians, and the people compassed; When Martius was not able to defend By arms, Veturia did her succour lend; And Martius mother, with the other won Romes priviledge, by chiding of her son: The Rhodians 'gainst Arthmesia did conspire, But e're the flame, she quencht the smoaking fire; She made them yield unto her Princely power, For which a relique standeth to this houre: What tongue can praise (though ne'r so eloqu?t) Enough, that Maid, born of a mean descent? Who when the English had invaded France. Amazon-like her weapons did advance, Driving the Armes of that cruell host And did regain the Kingdome even lost: She rescued both people, Towns and Cattle, And slew the Rebels in a bloudy battle, To lengthen out whose worthy memory, They built a Statue to eternity, Which ever since the building firmly stood Over the billows o'th Lygurian floud. Besides all these there are eminent Both Greeks and Latines, yea more excellent, As well derived from antiquities, As from our late and modern Histories; But I will close them in the smallest Cell, Lest this my work should too too largely swell: Nor have I spoken yet so much, but I Have left as much remaining secretly, 'Cause none shal me with proud ambition charge I'le not reveal their dignities at large; If I should seek their fame to comprehend, This Work of mine would never find an end: What mortall Writer can enumerate Their praise with pen? who can delineate Their fame and glory? do not all men find Themselvs preserved by the female kind? Romes builder knew, and rightly understood, That on them hung the Common peoples good; For whilst he wanted fruitfull Feminines To raise posterity for after times: Doth make no doubt to ravish Sabin Girls, To fill the Nation with those shining Pearls; For well he knew who built the Romish walls, The man voyd of his Mate to ruine falls: But to defend coacting with these Dames, He to their Fathers open war proclaims: So there arose twixt both (in sudden space) A bloudy fight just in the Market place; The Sabins having almost won the day, And stoln the Romish Capitol away, Mark what befell, the like was never seen, The women boldly running stept between The bloudy Troups, and caus'd the war to cease, And reconcil'd them with a friendly peace. For which attempt, not undeservingly, By Romulus th'are called Curii: And 'tis recorded with the Romans still, That none shall toyle in the laborious Mill, Nor act the Offices of slavish Cooks; This is recorded in the Roman Books. Nor must the man refuse to send or bring Unto the Woman every precious thing; But share alike in smiles or misery, Holding 'twixt both a joynt conformity. From hence arose the Laws in wedlock bands, That each should take his Mistresse by the hands, And yield to her all due respect as may be, For where he's Lord she is accounted Lady. But once again Rome was beseged round, Within five thousand paces of the Town. The Kings were quell'd, stout m? did valor lack, But women turn'd the raging Rebels back: In praise of which notorious example, To them was given a most famous Temple: Yea greater honour, and much dignitie, The Senate gave them by his own decree: Hence 'tis that they are plac't in honours row Of Festivals, but men are set below: It was allow'd that each should have their gems, Refined golden chains, rich Diodems, And garments purple, wrought with silver lace, with shining ear-rings to adorn the face: Rich gifts, and dowries, with immence possessi?s Did they receive, according to successions: 'Twas granted too for them to sacrifice To Funerals, with great Solemnities: So costly were they as by book appears, They pull'd their very ear-rings from their ears; No Gold was prized at too dear a rate, Rich Ladies burials to cellebrate: Behold again another Sabins fight, When all the Princes Host was put to flight: Their Ranks were broke, and many Nobles slain, But women put them in their Ranks again, And stroke their foes with such a mighty blow, As that it wrote their finall overthrow: Hence came the Law, that Persian Princes should Bequeath, and give their sundry sums of Gold To vulgar Dames, redoubling them among The tender Females, groaning great with yong: It was enacted by the Persian King, That every gift and honour they should bring To those brave women, yea their warlike powers Had won the favour of the Emperours. Justinian will not proceed in Lawes, Till he has told his prudent wife the cause. Again 'tis sayd, 'cause womens beauty shines, Therefore they granted to the Feminines, To equallize them in their husbands race, For as the man, so is the womans place. Is he an Emperour? then she's no less (By vulgar title) then an Emperess. Is he a crowned King? 'tis seldome seen, But she receives the title of a Queen. Man has no greater Priviledge, no more Prerogative then women had before: Indeed no greater License can he claime Then she, nor adde one dram more to his fame. They are licenc'd to judge and arbitrate In Common Counsels, and in private state; They can invest Fee-Farms with equity, And so determine how their Vassals lie: They keep their servants, chusing whom they please To recreate, and yield their labours ease. They have more power, and greater potency Then man, to give names to a Family. We know, the sons were named from the lines, Not of the Fathers, but the Feminines. Let's search again the civill Laws: we know It was enacted women should not go In common Goals to pay the scores of debts, But they are clos'd in purer Cabinets: Yea he that darest a woman to enclose Within a Goale, was judg'd his life to lose. If it be thought her crime unjust to be, She's forthwith turn'd into some Monast'ry, Or else secured in the custody Of curteous women, and the reason, why? Is that the Laws use them more mildly then The great offences of malicious men. Hence he that's catch'd in that notorious act Of carnall copulation, for the fact Receives his death, or else lies in a Cave: But women with the Monks their dwelling have Much speaketh Azo of their worthy fashions, I'th Speculator of Renunciations, Those ancient Lawyers grave and excellent Artificers in knowledge, yea most eminent, Knew by the secrets of Phylosophy, That women were (in nature of humanity) As strong in corporation, and as wise As them, therefore they us'd to exercise Themselves in wrestlings, yea the Feminines Were trained up in Martiall disciplines; In Bows, and slings, in Darts and Guns to shoot, In skirmishing on horseback or on foot, In leading on the Troups, in pitching Camps, In ord'ring Souldiers in their proper ranks. To speak in briefe, each act was done by them, That now is exercised by the men. Lets read antiquities among the chiefe, Perusing Writers worthy for beliefe: We'le find in Bactris and Galatia, And in the limits of Getulia, How men desired to adulterate, They were Lascivious and effeminate, But women to train Armies, Till, and Plow; Yea acting all things as the men do now. In the Cantabrians Laws, and many more, Their native daughters were preferr'd before The sons in portion, and in marriage too: For sisters gave their brethren so to do. The Scythian people, men and woman both, Held all things common by a binding Oath; And in their Counsels both for peace and war, The Matrons judgements were esteemed far, As it appears presented to our view, By these their words, which I present to you: If any Celtan of abuse complains, Received from the Carthaginians, Then let the Rulers ore the Magistrate Of Spaine, decide the case and arbitrate The fault; if any Carthaginian Hath suffer'd falsly from a Celtans man, Then let the Celtans grave Matrons proceed To judgement, of the good or evill deed: Perhaps you'l say that womens liberties Are oft restrain'd by humane tyrannies: 'Tis true indeed, 'tis so, and that's the cause, 'Tis man presuming on Jehovahs Laws: They are by mans precepts abolished, By use and custome th'are extinguished: For when the woman in the world is come, She's caus'd to live an idle life at home; She must not travell to another Nation, Her Needle only is her recreation: Then after, waxing to a greater age, She is confined to her husbands Cage, Or else shut up during her life to dwell Within some Abby, or the loathsome Cell Of Nuns: Such was mans base enormities, From Laws they kept th?, were they ne'r so wise. They are exempt from private arbitrations, From Intercessions, Juries, Procurations, Adoptions, and from judging causes all, Both good and bad, what e're was criminall. Men do forbid them publickly to preach The Word of God, as holy Scriptures teach; For it appears unto each vulgar eye, That Joel saith, Women shall Prophesie; So was it done in the Apostles time, The wife of Simeon with more did clime Up to the Pulpit, and instruct by rule, As well the solid wise man, as the foole: But now of late, so large mens sins are grown, That they usurp Gods wisdome as their own; They do the Women of their rights beguile, By breathing out invective speeches vile, Against their fame because they could not get Each man his soule in such a Cabinet. By their intruding priviledge they climb Up to degrees of honour, as in time Of bloudy war, when every one must yield That is not able to regain the field. 'Tis not by Rule, nor by divine Command, By which they take and hold the upper hand; Nor is't by title or possession right, But strength of arm, the Law that's called might. There's many men mistake themselves upon The grounds and precepts of Religion, And strive to prove their cruell tyrannies, By their contracting many falsities From truth: what's that? pray tell me; in a word, It is deriv'd from Genesis the third, Where it is said, mans servant shalt thou bee; He shalbe Lord and Ruler over thee: Again, if any shall object and say, That Christ has ta'ne the womans cross away; They'le answer by these words in generall, Spoken by Peter, and th'Apostle Paul: Let women yield unto their husbands will, Let them be silent in the Church and still. But they that can the Scriptures well compare, Will find what difference in Tropes there are; They'le know these reach but only to the bark, And outside, not unto the inner part, For such is man in poynt of dignities As are the Jews 'bove Greeks in promises; But God respects not man for honours sake, Nor Male, nor Female doth th'Almighty take, For great Renown, or for a grand Estate, But he loves such as are immaculate: Such were the cruell hearts of men, that they Must needs divorce their loving wives away: They bring their bills (the women to accuse) Drawn from the Laws of stony hearted Jewes; Yet these scurrilities bring no defect To womens praise, you know their intellect, And wisdome rings with such a sounding fame, That they have put gainsaying men to shame: But Sheba's Queen shall once return agen To judge the faithless of Jerusalem: Then each man that by faith is justifi'd, Shall have a Crown of glory, and abide Among the sons of blessed Abra'ms flock, Although deriv'd from sinfull Adams stock: But to conclude, let man retain his faith, And let him hear what ever Sarah saith: Now that I might my labours recollect, And view each matter with a briefe aspect: I've prov'd their honours and prerogatives, By name, and order, and religious lives: By humane Laws, and ground of reason too, By firm examples, tokens old and new; Yet notwithstanding, if ye seek to find, Heres not so much as we have left behind, Which we retain from every vulgar notion, Cause none should say vain-glory was the moti? To this our work; but twas by truth and zeale, That envious man might not from woman steale Her properties; I say, this to prevent, I wrote this little proved Argument; Which if defective, let some curious quill Correct, and mend, let him revise, and fill Each vacant place, with what he thinks is best To help the weakest, and adorn the rest: For here my Muse Urania, shuts the doore, She doth refuse to ayd my spirits more: Then fare ye well, ye glorious Ladies all, For I am gone, I hear Urania call.
