      <field name="fulltext">TO THE WORSHIPFULL his louing Brother Nicholas Turberuille Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his verie friend Ro. Baynes. My worde thy wish, my det, and thy desire, I mean my booke (my Baynes) lo here I send To thee at last, as friendship doth require, Though reason willes it rather left vnpend, For that the same the Authour should not shend: But blush who lust, so thou do like the worke, I am content it shall no longer lurke. Peruse ech page as leysure giues thee leaue, Reade ore each verse thus ragged as they lie, Let nothing slip whereby I may receiue The hatefull checke of curious readers eie: For well I know how haut thy muse doth flie: Wherefore I yeeld this foule mishapen Beare, Unto thy choise, to tender or to teare. Wherein if aught vnworth the presse thou finde, Vnfauorie or, that seemes vnto thy taste, Impute it to the troubles of my minde, VVhose late mishap made this be hatcht in haste, By clowdes of care best beauties be defaste: Likewise be wittes and freshest heads to seeke, Which way to write, when fortune list to streeke. Who know my cares, who wist, my wailefull woe, (As thou my friend, art priuie to the same) Or vnderstoode how griefe did ouergrow The pleasaunt plot which I for myrth did frame UUould beare with this, and quite me clean of blame For in my life I neuer felt such fittes, As whilst I wrote this worke did daunt my wittes For as the Pilot in the wrathfull waue, Beset with stormes, still beaten too and fro UUith boysteous bellowes, knowes not howe to saueue His sielie barke, but lets the rudder goe. And yeeldes himselfe whither tempest list to blowe So I amidde my cares had slender skill, To write in verse, but bowde to fortunes will. The more thy paine, thy trouble and thy toile, That must amend amisse eache faulte of mine, Yet grudge not (Baynes) with share to turne the soile In sorte as though the same were wholie thine, The charge whereof, loe here I do refine For want of health, my friend at large to thee, Since that my limmes with greef surcharged be. Apollos lore I quite haue layde aside, And am enforst his Phisicke to peruse: I hate the Harpe, wherein was all my pride, I hunte for hearbes, I lothe Mineruas muse, My want of health, makes me my booke refuse: The blowing rage that erst inspirde my braine, Saturns chilling humour doth restraine. Wherefore sith I confesse my want of skill, And am to seeke to better this my booke, So (Baines) thou runne vnto Parnassus hill, As Helicon, or else that learned brooke, Which Pegase made, when he the soile fosooke: For well thou knowst, where Clio and the rest, Did tune their Lutes, and pipe with pleasant brest. I can no more, but for thy mickle paine, Yeeld thousand thankes vpon my naked knee, And if thou neede the like supply againe, Assure thy selfe then I will pleasure thee: So friends vnto each other bounden be. (My Baynes) Adew, this little booke of mine, When thou hast done, may best be termed thine. Thy friend, George Turberuile. Ro. Baynes to the Reader, in the due commendation of the Author. What waight of graue aduice, what reson left vnsaught, What more, of Pallas braine hath tast, than Poets pens haue taught. Whose powdred saaes are mixt, with pleasure, and delight: Aduising this, forewarning that, directing still the right. Which vaine though Grecians first, &amp; Romaines after found: Yet now the same in English phrase, doth gorgeously abound. A vertue lately wonne, to this our natiue soile: By such as seeke, their countrey praise, though to their greater toile. Among the rest, who hath, employed therein more paine? Or who? than Turberuill hath found, in verse a sweeter vaine? Whose quill, though yet it tread, the path of greene delight: The same who vewes, shall find his lines, with learned reason dight. And as to elder age, his stayed braine shall grow: So falling from, his riper penne, more graue conceits may flow. The while, let ech man reape, the pleasure that he lends. The cost is free, his charge but small, an others wealth that spends. The subiect here, is such, as differs farre from pelfe: I deeme thee wise, thy iudgement good, the thing will praise it self. Qui nihil sperat nihil disperat. The Authour here declareth the cause why hee wrote these Histories, and forewent the translation of the learned Poet Lucan. I undertooke Dan Lucans verse, and caught hys borne in hand, To sound out Cæsars blooddy broiles and Pompeis puisant bande: I meant to paint the haughtie hate of those two marshall men, And had in purpose ciuill swords of rufull Rome to pen: Of rufull Rome to penne the plagues when Cæsar sought to raigne, And Pompey pitying Countries spoyle, would doe him downe againe. I had begonne that hard attempt, to turne that fertile soyle. My bullocks were alreadie yokte, and flatly fell to toyle. Me thought they laboured meetlie well, Tyll on a certaine night: I gazde so long vpon my booke in bed by candle light. Till heauy sleep full slilie came and muffled so mine eye, That I was forst with quill in hand in slumber downe to lie. To whom within a while appeard Melpomene, the Muse, That to intreat of warlike wights, and dreadfull armes doth vse. Who me beheld with graue regard, and countnance fraught with feare: And thus the gastly Goddesse spake, her wordes in minde I beare. And art thou woxe so wilfull, as thou seemest to outward eye? Darste thou presume with ymped quilles so prowde a pitch to flie? Remember how fonde Phæton farde, that vndertooke to guide: Apollos charge, by meane of which that wilfull wanton dide. Eare thou doe wade so farre, reuoke to minde to bedlam boy, That in his forged wings of waxe reposed too great a ioy: And soard so neare the scorching blaze of burning Phœbus brande, As feathers failde, and be fell short of what he tooke in hand. In this thy hauty heart thou shewst, too playne thy pryde appeares, How durst thou deale in field affaires? leaue off, vnyoke thy Steeres. Let loftie Lucans verse alone, a deed of deepe deuise. A stately stile, a peerelesse pen, a worke of weightie pryce. More meete for noble Buckhurst braine, where Pallas built her bowre, Of purpose there to lodge her selfe, and shew her princely powre. His swelling vaine would better blase, those Royall Romane peeres: Than anyone in Brutus land, that liude these many yeeres. And yet within that little Isle of golden wittes is store, Great change and choise of learned ymps as euer was of yore. I none dislike, I fancie some, but yet of all the rest. Sance enuie, let my verdite passe, Lord Buckurst is the best. Wee all that Ladie Muses are, Who be in nuber nine: With one accord did blesse this babe, each said, This ympe is mine. Each one of vs, at time of birth, with Iuno were in place: And each vpon this tender childe, bestowd her gift of grace. My selfe amonge the moe alowde him Poets praised skill, And to commend his gallant verse. I gaue him wordes at will. Minerua luld him on her lappe, and let him many a kisse: As who would say when all is done, they all shall yeeld to this: This matter were more meet for him, and farre vnfit for thee: My sister Clio, with thy kinde, doth best of all agree. Shee deals in case of liking loue. her lute is set but lowe. And thou werte wonte in such deuise, thine humour to bestow, 1. As when thou toldest the Shepheards tale, that Mantuan erst had pend: 2. And turndst those letters into verse, that louing Dames did send Vnto their lingring mates that fought at sacke and siege of Troy: 3 And as thou didst in the writing of thy songs of sugred ioy. 4 Mancynus vertues fitter ore, for thee to take in hande, Than glitering gleaues, and weakfull warres, that all on slaughter stand The Giants proud, aspiring pompe when they so fondly strove, And hopde with helpe of heaped hills to conquere mightie Ioue, Is not for euery wit to wield, the weight too heauy weare. For eury Poet that hath wrote in auncient age to beare: Unless that Lucan Virgill, or the great renowmed Greeke Would vndertake, those boysteous broiles, the rest are all to seeke, Each slender ship that heares a saile, and flittes in quiet flood: Is not to brooke the byllowe, when the rooryng seas be wood. Alcydes slippers are too wide for euery wretch to weare Not euery childe can Atlas charge, vpon hys shoulders beare. Not euery dick that dares to drawe a sworde, is Hectors peere, Not euery woodman that doth shoote hath skill to chose his Deere No beast can match the lions might his force is ouer fell: Though euery little starre doe shine, yet doth the Sunne excell. Not euery bryer, or tender twigge, is equall to the Pyne, Nor euery Prelate that can preache, is thought a deepe deuine. Not euery fish that flittes amyd the floud with feeble finne, Is fellowe to the Delphine swifte, when he doth once beginne. The peeuishe puttocke may not preace in place where Eagles are. For why their kingly might exceedes, their puissance passeth farre. All which I speake to let thee wyte, that though thou haue some skill, Yet hast thou not sufficient stuffe this Authors loome to fill. Too slender is thy feeble twiste, thy webbe is all too weake: Before thy worke be halfe dispatchte, no doubte thy warpe will breake. Wherefore renounce thy rash deuice, thy yeelding force I knowe: And none so well as I can iudge, the bente of Lucans bowe. Thinke of the toade in Æsops tale, that sought to matche the Bull, For highnesse, and did burst at length, his bowels were so full, So thou, vnlesse thou take good heede, translating Lucans warre, Shalt spoyle thy Lute, &amp; stroy thy strings, in straining them too farre. I heere aduise and eke commaunde that thou no farther goe: Laye dawne thy Lyre obey my will, for sure it shall be so. With that my drousie slumber fledde, my senses came againe: And I that earst was drownde in dreames, behelde the Goddes playne, Whose frouning phrase &amp; spitefull speach had daunted so my witte, As for my life I wilte not howe. to shape an aunswere fitte. Each worde (me thought) did wound me so, eache looke did lurche my harte: Eache sentence bredde my sorrowes such, eache lyne was like a darte. But yet at laste with manly minde, and mouth vnfraught of feare, Unto this loftie learned Muse, these wordes I vttred there: O noble Impe, and daughter deare to mightie Ioue his grace: It much relieues my weakened wittes to see thy heauenly face. For which ten thousand thanks I yelde thee heere with bended knee: And counte my selfe the blessedst man aliue, thine eyes to see. Thy presence makes me to presume, thou holdst me verie deare: But (out alas) thy wordes were such as I was lothe to heare. Controlements came fr? haughtie breast, for that I vndertooke With English quill to turne the verse of learned Lucans booke. And shall I (Lady) be unflyted to take in hande a deed, By which vnto my natiue soyle aduantage may succeed By which the ciuill swordes of Rome and mischiefes done thereby, May be a myrrour vnto vs, the like mishappes to flie? I yeelde my brayne too barraine farre, my verses all too vyle, My pen too playne, with metre meete to furnish Lucans style: Whose deepe deuise, whose filed phrase, and Poets peerelesse pen, Would cloye the cunningst head in court, and tyre the lustiest men. But yet sith none of greater skill, and ryper witte would write Of Cæsar and Pompeius warres, a woorke of rare delight: I thought it good as well to passe the idle time away, As to the worlde to set to vewe howe discorde breedes decay: To turne this princely Poets verse, that simple men might see Of Ciuill broyles and breach at home, how great the mischeiues bee. But sith it standes not with your wills who lady Muses are, That one so dull as I, should deale in case concerning warre: I am content to plie vnto your pleasures out of hande, It bootes me not against the will of heauenly states to stande. Yet being that my present plight is stufte with all anoye, And late mishaps haue me bereft my rimes of roisting ioye: Syth churlish fortune clouded hath my glee, with mantell blacke, Of foule mischaunce, wherby my barke was like to bide the wracke: (Good ladie) giue me leaue to write some heauy sounding verse, That by the vewe thereof, my harmes the readers heart may perse. With that the Goddesse gaue a becke, and yeelded my request, And vanisht streight without offence, and licenste me to reste. Then I to reading Boccas fell, and sundrie other moe Italian Authours, where I found great stoare of states in woe, And sundrie sortes of wretched wights: some slayne by cruell foes, And other some that through desire and Loue their lyues did lose: Some Tyrant thirsting after bloud, themselues were fowly slayne: And some did sterue in endlesse woes, and pynde with bitter payne. Which gaue me matter fitte to write: and herevpon it grewe That I this Tragicall deuise, haue sette to open viewe. Accept my paynes, allow me thankes, if I deserue the same, If not, yet lette not meaning well be payde with checke and blame. For I am he that buylde the bowre, I hewe the hardened stone, And thou art owner of the house, the paine is mine alone. I burne the bee, I holde the hyue, the Sommer toyle is myne: And all bicause when winter commes, the honie may be thine. I frame the foyle, I graue the golde, I fashion vp the ring, And thou the iewell shalt enioye, which I to shape doe bring. Adieu (good Reader) gaze thy fill, if aught thine eyes delight: For thee I tooke the woorke in hande, this booke is thine of right. [Tragicall Tales.] [Through wilful loue, and liking ouermuch] The argument to the first Historie. 1 Through wilful loue, and liking ouermuch, Nastagios state did melt, and without returne Of like good will: Euphymius minde was such She felt no flame, when he, good man, did burne But made his griefe her glee, his bitter smarte Might nothing rize or pierce her marble harte. 2 By friendes aduise at last he parted thence, Though greatly greeued, remouing racke him sore, To quit the cause of al his fond expence, And purchase ease which he had lost before: A death (no doubt) it was to put away, And yet no life with her in place to stay. 3 Beholde the happ, as he ful pensiue stoode Amyd a groue adioyning to his tent, Recounting former toyes: athwart the wood With cruell curres an armed knight there went, That had in chace a frotion fresh of hewe, Whom he by force of sword and mastiues slewe. 4 And after death this lady liude againe Vp start away she ran before the Knight, For thus the Goddes alotted had her paine, Bycause she slewe by scorne that louing wight: In death he was her plague whome she in life Enforst to slay himselfe with murthering knife. 5 Nastagio pondering in his restlesse thought As wel the sequele, as the cause of all. Seing that skorne the ladies penance wrought. For dealing earst so hardely with hir thrall: Bethought him howe to make a myrrour right Both of the mayde, and eke the cursed knight. 6 His plat was thus: he byd in friendly sort Vnto his tente, to feast and banket there His auncient loue, that made his payne hir sporte, Whose mother came and diuers friendes I feare, Amyds the feast the knight pursude the mayde, And slewe hir there, as I before haue sayde. 7 Which sight amazde the route, but most of all That virgin coye, so carelesse of the man Begonne to quake it toucht her to the gall, And therevpon hir liking first began. For after that she woxe his wife at last, Dreading the gods reuenge for rigour past. In Italie there is a Citie, hight Rauenna, by report as braue a place As may be found, both fresh &amp; fair to sight Wherein of yore there was a noble race Of gallant wights, great choise of men of fame, But one in chief, Nastagio by name. The father of this forward ympe did dye, Forespent with yeeres, and load with siluer locks, Whose land and fee descended orderly Unto the Sonne, with store of other stocks: Few fathers of this aged mans degree, In so good case did leaue their sonnes as hee. This might suffice to make Nastagio rich, But, where wealth is, there lightlie followes more, For hee an vncle had, who gaue as mych At time of death, as father left before: The wealth of these two rych renowmed wights, In little space vpon Nastagio lights. Not one in all Rauenna might compare With him for wealth, or matcht him for his muck: He liude at full, not tasting any care, But tooke his time, and vsde his golden luck: Not wanting ought that fitted for his state, By meane of flowing wealth full warme he sate. This youth his wanton prime without a wife, Retchlesse consumde, and liude in single sort, Esteeming that to be the blessed life, Because he found it stuft with glee and sporte: As yonkers that at randon vse to range, Refuse to wed, because they loue to change. Untill at length his roauing eies hee kest Upon a wench, and tooke so perfect view Of Graces that did harbour in her brest, As streight to liking of this maid he grewe His fansie fed vpon hir featurde lookes, In sort as none saue her this gallant brookes. Who doublesse was a neate and noble Dame, Trauersar cleaped was her worthie Sire, And she herselfe Euphymia cald by name, As fresh of hewe as men might well desire: With her I say, Nastagio fell in loue, Whose setled choyse no reason might remoue. Her christall eyes had lurcht his yeelding heart, And razde his bending breast by often glaunce, Her glittering locks so queyntly coucht by art, Had brought this youth to such a louing traunce, As all his care was how to compasse grace, From her whom he so derely did imbrace. (Then as it is the trade of Cupids knights) He fell to feast, where lackt no daintie fare, To come be forraine cates that breede delights, For no expence this courtly wight would spare. Hee vsde the tilt on Ienate trapt with gold, To please his Dannas eyes with courage bold. For is she be a noble Dame in deede, Shee pleasure takes to view a manlie knight In armour clad, be striding of his steed: And doth detest the base and coward wight, For that the valiant will defend her fame, When carpet squires will hide their heads with shame. Thus wasted he the day in Loue deuice, And spent the nights with costly musikes sound, In hope at length this virgin to entice To salue his sore, and cure his couert wounde: Nothing was left in any point vndone, Whereby the loue of Ladies might be wonne: By letters he vnfolded all his fittes, By message eke imparted all his paine, His mournfull lines bewraid his mazed wits, His songs at loue declarde his passions plaine: The rockiest heart aliue it would haue movde, To see how well this noble man had loude, Yet cruell shee, when he had done and saide The most he might to moue her stonie heart, To like of him might not at all be waide, For shee was struck with Cupids Leaden dart, Whose chilling cold had bound her bowels so, As in no wise she could abridge his wo. But how much more the louer made his mone, Suing for ruth and well deserued grace, The more shee sate vnmoued, like the stone, Whom waues do beat, but wag not from his place: Either beauties pride or stately flocke did force This haughtie dame from pitie and remorce. Shee rigorouslie refusde, and tooke disdaine, So much as once to yeeld him friendlie cheare, Who for her sake had bid such bitter paine, As any tender heart would bleed to heare: And in reward of all his friendship past, Shee gaue him leaue to spoile himselfe at last. Wherto through deep dispaire his mind was b?t In hope thereby to end his wretched woe, Because he saw her malice not relent, Who for good will became his deadlie foe: For in such cuse aye death is counted light, Where men may not enioy their sweete delight. His wilfull hand was armde with naked knife, And euen at point to giue the fatall stroke, By short dispatch of loathed lingring life, To ridde his wearie neck of heauie yoke: But life was sweete, and he to liue, would leaue The Dame, from whom he might no ruth receiue. When Fansie saw his raging humour cease, And Reason challenge rule, and charge againe, Whereby his fond affection woulde decease, And hee be quit of all his former paine: To keepe him in, and hold his louer fast, She gaue him Hope, to come by loue at last. Thus diuers thoughts did soiourne in his brest, Sometimes he meant himselfe with sword to slay, Another time to leaue to loue was best: Some other while affection bare the sway: Was neuer man belowe the starrie skie, So loth to liue, and yet so woe to die. For why? in life he found himself a thrall, Unable aye to compasse his delight: And yet by death there was no hope at all, For then he was assurde to loose her quight: So neither life nor death might ease his minde, That by the Gods was thus to loue assignde. Whilst thus Nastagio sought his owne decay, By liquorous lust, his friendes and nearest kinne Perceiuing how his wealth did wast away, And that his bodie pinde and waxed thinne: Did diuers times their friendly counsell giue, That from Rauenna he abroade should liue. For change of place perhaps wold purchase helth And absence cause his foolish fancies weare: They did not leaue to tell him how his wealth And all things els consumde, and melted there: But scornefull he did scoffe their good aduise, And had their grauest wordes in slender price. As louers wont, who fancie nothing lesse Than speeches tending all to their auaile: Not much vnlike the lame, for whose redresse. When counsell commes, they lightlie turne their taile, Loathing to lend an eare to holsome lore, Of such as seeke to salue their lingring sore. Yet they like friends would neuer blin or stint, To shew him meanes to better his estate: Whereby, As often drops do pearce the flint, So they at length by many speeches, gare His free consent to trauell for a space, To trie what chaunce would hap by change of place. Iudge you that loue, and can discerne aright, How great annoy departure bredde in minde To him that loude a passing proper wight: (Though not belovde) &amp; now must leaue behinde The idoll that was shrinde within his brest. Whose rife remembrance lowde him little rest? But yet away for promise sake he would, All needfull things were ready for the same, Both cates and coyne, with plate of beaten gold: And for his better comfort, kinsmen came, Who ioyed to see him part away from thence, Where she abode that causd his lewde expence. To forraine coast Nastagio now was bent, But not resolude what speciall place to see, Eyther Flaunders, France or Spaine, I think he ment. For that those seates of ciuile nature be: To make it short, hee tooke his horse in poast, And so departs the soyle he fansied most. They had not trauailde farre, before they came Unto a place, that from Rauenna stood Three miles or thereabout, the village name Was Classye, there Nastagio thought it good To make aboude, for ease and solace sake, Wherefore he pight his tent, and thus bespoke. In thank you (friends quoth hee) with all my hart, I hold my selfe indebted for your paine, Now here you may (if so you list) depart, And to Rauenna shape returne againe: For I and mine will respite here a space, I like the seate, and fancie well the place. Here doe I meane to make assured stay, Untill the rufull Gods doe ease my woe, And Cupide chase my sorowes cleane away, I purpose not a foote from hence to goe: Lo here I pledge my faith to come no more Unto the soyle where I receiude my sore. Which promise if I hold, you haue your willes, Who gaue aduise and counsell to the same: There restes no more your pensiue friend fulfils A heauie charge, to flee so faire a Dame, As to my doome, there are not many moe, To match with her, whose beautie breedes my woe. But well, content I am, at your request To liue exilde, in manner as you see, I will no more produce mine owne vnrest, By louing her that loathes to pitte me: And hauing thus at full declarde his minde, They tooke their leaues, he pausde and staid binde. Thus he at plasure lodgde, did banket more, And led his life at greater libertie, Than in Rauenna he had done of yore: Hee did exceede for courtly iolitie, There wanted no delight that youth doth craue, Which he for coyne or any cost might haue. And whylom, as his auncient custome was, For diuers of his friendes he vsde to send, In gladsome ioyes the wearie day to passe: Whereby no loue care might his ease offend: Was neuer wight that liude in greater glee, Nor spent his time in brauer sort than hee. When May, with motly robes began his raigne, (A lustie time for euery louing lad) Nastagio pondering in his busie braine, The slender hyre that he receiued had, And foule repulse for all his good desart, Gan walke abrode, and wild his groomes to part. Whereby he might the better call to thought, The causelesse rigour of the cruell Dame: Whose smal regard his former spoil had wrought And turnde his torments into pleasaunt game: Along he paced into a gladsome groue, Whilst in his head ten thousand fancies stroue. There stalkte he on, as soft as foote could tread, In deepe discourse of beautie and disdaine, Untill himselfe a mile or more he lead Into the Coppyse, not hauing any traine: So long he staide, as dinner time drew neare, Which he forgot, not minding bellye cheare. Loe see the hap, that him did there betide, Within a while he heard a dolefull noyse, Of one that in the groue full shrilly cryde, Who seemde to be a virgin by her voyce: The sodayne feare so much amazde the man, As streight to leaue his pleasant thoughtes he gan, Uplifted he his head, and glewde aboute To see what woofull wight it was and why She so exclamde, and made such sodaine shoute: And as alongst the lawnde he kest his eye, A naked Nymphe well shapte in euery lym, With speedie pace, he sawe come towards him, Retchelesse she ran through thick &amp; thin amayn, Bebrusht with bryers her broosed body bled. The brambles skirmishte had with euery vayne, Untrust her haire hoong rounde about her head: And euer as she ranne athwarte the wood, Mercy she cryde with open mouth a good. Two monstrous mastyues eke he sawe that ran Close by her side, two vgly curres they were, Who euer as they ouertooke her, gan Her haunches with their greedie teeth to teare: To view (alas) it was a wofull sight, Such hungrie boundes on naked flesh to light. He lookte a little more ascance, and vewde One riding faste, as Ienats legges could goe, A hydeous knight, to seeming swarthie hewde, And (as appearde) he was the maydens foe: For in his hande a naked sword he had, Whose face was grimme, and he in blacke yclad. Who gallopt on, and glewde with fell regarde, Pronouncing threates and termes of hye disdaine, Which cruell tooles for murther well preparde: And cryde so loude Nastagio heard it plaine, That he reuenge of her by death would take, With other thundring words which thoe he spake. Thus for an houre space, or thereaboute, In one selfe brake Nastagio mazed stoode Perplexed sore, and greatly in a doubte, Beholding howe the dogges athwarte the wood, Did chace the wench, and how the wrathful knight With gastly looke pursewde this sillie wight. So long he gazde, that pitie grew in fine, And swelling yre incenst his manly brest, Pricking him on, and making him repine, To see a sillie dame so sore distresse: So as vnlesse he rescued her from foes, She was assurde eftsoone her life to lose. But bootlesse twas to meane to help the mayde, Not hauing weapons fit, nor sworde, nor launce, But yet, bicause the case required ayde, He caught a truncheon from a Pyne by chaunce, And therewithall against the armed knight And both his curres he made with all his might. The horseman when he sawe Nastagio bent For her supplie, whom he would reaue of life: Exclamde alowde, withstande not mine intent Nastagio, stinte and breede no further stryfe, Forgoe thy force, let mastiues haue their will, Sith they and I this monster meane to kill. He scarsly spake the worde, but by and by The egre curres vnto her flankes they flewe, And with her bloud that ran abundantly, Their monstrous mouths they hastned to imbrewe: Withall the knight dismounted from his steede, And in he ranne his hungrie dogges to feede. Nastagio seeing this approcht the knight, I muse (quoth he) how thou shouldst know my name Who neuer earst, eche ether sawe with sight, But this assure thy selfe, it is a shame, A man at armes his honour to distaine, With conquest of a mayde so fowly slaine. A blouddie facte, a simple wenche to kill With cruell sworde, whose force consistes in flight, A beastly parte, such mastiues mawes to fill, With giltlesse bloud, a villaines nature right. Thou dealste with her, as though she were a beaste In forest bredde, not tasting womens breast. Assure thy selfe as much as lyeth in me, I meane to garde her, maugre all thy might, I compte her cleare without offence to be, She is vnlike to be a guiltie wight: I may not brooke such wrong in any wise, Against my kinde and honour sore it lies. Wherto the knight to this effect replyde: Nastagio would thou wist and knewst it well, That I to thee am verie neere allyde, Both borne and bred where thou &amp; thyne do dwell: My first descent I tooke of noble race, Thou knowst my stocke. Now listen to my case. I lyued, when thou wert but of tender age, A mortall man, and hight sir Guye by name, My lucke was such as fansie made me rage, And fall in liking with this stately dame, Whom here thou seest, my loue was nothing lesse Than that which doth thy yeelding heart possesse. I likte her well, I helde her verie deare: But cruell she, so tygrelyke requites My great good will with such a skornfull cheare, As lacke of tuche berefte me my delightes: Despaire so grewe within my haplesse brest, As on a time to compasse greater rest, This fauchion fell, in deepe despite I drewe, To stinte my woes which neuer would aslake, And with the same my sefe I fowly flewe, In hope thereby an ende of hale to make: Which wicked deede the Gods detested so, As I was iudgde to hollow hell to go. And there assignde by rightfull doome diuine, For shortning of my life to liue in payne, Where lingring griefes should make my ghost to pine, For life mispent the fittest hire &amp; gayne: With Pluto thus it was my lot to stay, Woe worth the time that I my selfe did staye. But listen on within a little space, This haughtie dame that hastned on my death, For yeelding me such slender hire and grace, Who thought it none offence to stoppe my breath, Likewise did dye, whome mightie Ioue and iuste, For her desarte, among the furies thrust. To quit her shame, in hell she had a share, With diuelish impes, that whilom wanted grace: And after that she had remayned thare, And plungde her limmes in frozen pittes a space, She was aduaunste vp to the earth againe, And I with her to breede eche others payne. Loe thus the Gods did will it for to bee, Whose sentence may at no time be vndone. That she in poaste (as thou thy selfe doest see) All bare of roabes before these dogs should ronne, And I on horsebacke after her should goe, Not as a friende, but like a mortall foe. And looke howe ofte I reachte her on the way, So oft I should dismember all her corse, With selfe same sworde that did his maister slay, She giuing cause, though I did vse the force: And butcherlike to rippe her downe the raynes, Who for good will, allowde me bitter paines. And hauing cut her carkasse quite in twayne, That I should crushe the heart as colde as stone, Not sparing to dispoyle eche little vayne, Eche tender corde and string that grewe theron: And take those other inwarde partes, to feede My hungrie dogs, to serue their present neede. This heauie doome was by the Gods assignde The cruell dame, for wanting dewe regarde: She is assurde no greater ease to finde, This torment is for her outrage preparde: These curres and I in order as you see, Appoynted are her daily scourge to be. And in this selfe same groue where now we goe, Eache Friday neere about this tyme of day, This wicked wenche bewayles her wretched woe, And I with helpe of curres my part do play. The mastiues they doe chace her thwarte the wood, And I imbrewe my weapon with her blood. Ech place where she hath wroth my wo ere this, And yelded griefe in guerdon of good will, Unto her plague that place appointed is, There must I her with bloudie weapon kill: And marke how many monthes I spent in loue, So many yeeres must she this penance proue. Wherefore doe let me put the same in vre, Which she deserues, and Ioue did giue in charge, Let her for former pride such paines endure, As she may smarte, and I my selfe discharge: In any wise take not her cause in hande. In vaine it were for man with God to stande. Nastagio hauing heard the tale he tolde, And waying well the earnest words he spake, Although he were a ventrous wight and bolde, Yet gan his trembling limmes with fear to quake: He had not tho a haire but stoode vpright, Wherwith he starte abacke, as one afright. And gazde vpon the girle in woful case, Marking the rigour that the knight would vse And practise thereupon the wench in place, Who was to bide his force, and might not chuse: His harte it bled within his breast, to vewe, Howe tho the knight to diuelish choler grewe. For when he had his tedious processe donne, Full like a bedlam beast in forrest bred, He gan vpon the silly wretche to ronne, Who to escape, before the mastiues fled: With naked sworde he preast to do the deed, And came behinde, full cowardlyke to speede. Bootlesse it was for her away to flye: The Ienate was too good for her of foote, And more than that, the tyrant was so nye, As to appeale for pitie was no boote: Wherfore with faint, for feebled as she was, With bowing knee she fell vpon the grasse. The greedie houndes estsoone began to bite, Seazing vpon her carkas with their iawes: With that comes in the gastly sweating knight, Who thrust her through, &amp; made no longer pawse: Streight down she went, w? bloudy brest to ground Unable to sustayne so great a wounde. Then backe he put his hand behinde his hippes, And drewe a shoulder knife of purpose made, Wherwith the beast the brisket bone vnrippes, As is the bluddie butchers common trade: And out he hewde the liuely leaping hearte, Whereof eche wayting mastiue had a parte. They quickly chopte it vp, and made dispatche, As carrion curres and rauening whelpes do vse, That euery filthy morsell lightly snatche, And being nipt with famine, nought refuse: As soone as this was doone, the virgin rose, And was on foote, and to the seawarde goes. As though there had bene no such matter past, And by her side the mastiues raune a mayne, The knight he mounted on his horse in haste, Not sparing spurres, and out he drew agayne The dreadfull sworde, as he had done of yore: Within a while Nastagio sawe no more. They vanisht soone as those that went apace, On neither side was slacknesse to be founde, The mayde she mounted, being had in chace, Life made her leape, euen as the Hare doth bound: The hungry dogs, that hunger starued weare, Layde on as fast her fleshye flankes to teare. The rustie knight he gaue his horse the rayne, And followde harde, as men for wager ronne, Upon desire to plague the wenche againe, Who earst to him so great a wrong had donne: Thus famine, feare, and fell reuenging minde, Made mastiues, maid, &amp; knight their legs to finde. Nastagio hauing seene this pageant plaide, Stoode still in part to pittie movd withall, In part with strangenesse of the sight dismaide, Began to ponder with himselfe, and call To minde afresh, how that the knight had told, Ech fryday that he might the like behold. Which fitted well he thought for his intent. It might perhaps turne him in time to good: Wherefore he markt the place, and home he went, Leauing a signe vndoubted where he stood, Till time he were dispozde to put in vre, That newe deuise, his quiet to procure. Retirde vnto his tent, his man he sends Unto Rauenna, out of hand to will His nearest kin, and best beloued friends To visite him in proofe of their good will: Who being bid, came posting streight away, To whom Nastagio thus began to say: Mine auncient friends, you counseld me of yore To shun the shamefull loue, that whylom I Bestowde on her, that me tormented sore, And plagude me so as I was like to die: You warned mee to flie my pleasant foe, Within whose brest no tender ruth might grow. And more than that, you friendly did aduise That I should part my countrey, to auoide My monstrous charge, that dailie did arise And mount so hie as I was much anoyde, Now friendes, the wished time is come, for I Am readie here vnto your best to plie. I yeeld you heartie thanks in humble sort, In great good part your holsome reade I take: I craue no more, but that you will resort Unto my lodge on Friday next, to make Good cheere, bring Paule Trauersar then along, And eke his wife, or els you do me wrong, In any wise let not the Matron leaue That daintie peace her daughter deare behind, I meane in friendly manner to receiue My friendes as then: such fare as you shall ffind, Accept in gree, faile not to come, I pray, And bring with you these parties at the day. So many as were present there in view, Both gaue him thankes, and promist not to faile, Themselues to come, and bid the residue, Which they performde, the sute did soone preuaile With all the guestes, saue with that rockie maide, Who scornd his feast, and gladly would haue staid. But yet at length with much ado she went, The presence of her parents led her on, Who being come vnto Nastagios tent, With courtly grace he greeted euerie one, Reioycing there to see so braue a traine, But her chiefe, that bred him all his paine. Iust vnderneath a very statelie Pine, That shadowed all the troupe in compasse round, The table stood, where all these states should dine: To tell you truth, it was the selfe same grounde, Where earst the knight had had the maid in chace: The feaster prayde eche one to take his place. And so they did, regarding their estate That worthie were the highest reeme to holde: The fourme was fraught, vpon the bench there sat Euphymia, so as shee must needes behold From first to last all thinges that fortunde tho, There was no shift, Nastagio meant it so. I leaue to descant of their daintie fare, (Set bankets made by Courtiers lacke no cates.) We may presume the seruice there was rare. Because the board was virond round with states: So much the more because his mistresse came, Whom hee had found so coy and queint a dame. When second course was servde in order rowne, Euen then the blooddie Tragedie began: The Sewer set the meate no sooner downe, But by and by was heard of euery man, A yelling noise that Echode in the skies, The wofulst sound that man might well deuise. Whereat ech one that sate at meate did muze, Demaunding who that wretched wight should bee, And asaing what should meane that sodain newes, They heard a voyce, but coulde no creature see: They vaunst themselues; &amp; stood mee bolt vpright, Because they would the sooner haue the sight. Within a while, ech one might plainly viewe A naked Nymph with mastiues by her side, And eke an vgly knight that did pursue, And posting on a Croyden Ienate ride: It was not long before they proched neere The place, where as was held this royall cheere. Wherein among the gazing guests she flewe, Exclaiming therefor each with open armes: with that regrete and tender pitie grew within their breastes, to rescue her from harmes: To whom the knight cryde, let alone the maid, Reciting that which he before had said. He shewde at large, both who the partie was, And did vnfold the cause of all her woe, And why the sentence of the Gods did passe In cruell sort vpon the mayden so: which pocesse made them muze and marueile much, So as none durst the knight or curres to touch. Then he behavde him as he did of yore, Slashing the Lady with his fauchion fell. The dogs receivde their pittance as before: who fed vpon the heart, and likte it well: As many men and women as did view This wofull sight, and both the parties knew. And eke the houses whence they did descende, And wist the cause of all this cursed case, But now sir Guye for faithfull loue was shend, And how the cruell maiden wanted grace: with one consenting minde lamented so, As out brast teares in witnesse of their woe. When that the knight had vsde the matter thus In blooddie sort, as you haue heard it told: Amongst themselues the feasters gan discusse, And diuersly debate from young to old, From first to last, what lately hapned there, Toucht all with dread, but most that dame did fear Whom good Nastagio loude, and tendred much Because she thought within her guiltie minde, That her in chiefe this tragedie did touch, For foule disdaine and being so vnkinde To him who for good will deserued ruth, And could atchieue but scorne for all his truth. Then first of all resorted to her thought, what rockie heart and brasen breast she bare The courteous Knight, her loue that dearly bought, And who for her had langsluisht long in care: And hereupon as there shee sate in place, Shee thought herself the wench that was in chase. Full sore she feard her flanks, &amp; thought shee sawe Her friende pursue her on his fretting steed, And how he did his wrathful weapon draw To take reuenge of that her cursed deed: And meant besides his hungrie hounds to fill with flesh of her, for want of due good will, So passing was her dread, as then there grewe A deepe desire within her mellow breast, Her louing friend in gentle wise to rewe: Whereby her selfe might purchace quiet rest, And scape the scourge and penance for her pride Bestowde on him, who deepe in fansie fride. When finisht was this feast and royall cheare, And euery guest returned backe again Unto her home, Euphymia did appeare Tormented sore, and vext with monstrous paine, The sodaine feare of what shee saw of late, Had planted in Loue, in place of former hate. The silent time that others doe bestowe From heauie cares and troubles of the day To quiet sleepe did breed this Ladies woe, Who might not chase those deepe conceites away: No wished winke could enter in her eye, Unto her pillow fansie sate so nie. When day drew on, and Phœbus with his waine Had cleard the pole, and darknesse put to flight, She felt a fresh supply of pleasant paine, And wept the dayes as shee had watcht the night: Nastagio stacke so firmely in her breast, As for her life shee could not compasse rest. Wherefore shee calles a chamber maid of trust, (A wittie wench, and one that knew her good) And told her that in all the hast she must Unto Nastagios tent in Classy wood: To let him wit, that if he would vouchsaue Her honest loue, he might his purpose haue, For shee was fully bent without delay To stoupe vnto his will, if so it were His pleasure, then with speed to come away. The maid departs, and being entred where Nastagio was, shee told her mistresse minde From point to point, as dutie did her binde. All haile (good sir) quoth shee, in luckie houre And blessed time I viewe thy louely face: Mine vnexpected comming to thy boure, And preassing here thus ouerbold in place, Is by my ioyfull newes to wright thy case, Whose noble minde in loue hath melted long, As to thy pains, so to thy open wrong. Sufficeth now thy sad and solemne cheare, Discharge those cankred cares that fret thy mynde, Lay sorrow quite aside, which thou too deare Hast bought, by means my Mistresse was vnkinde Plucke vp thy spirites, hencefoorth be sure to finde, As great good liking at my Ladies hand, As thou wouldst wish, she means thy frend to stand. And for a proofe of what I vtter now, Loe the lines that flatly do vnfolde Her yelding necke, that to thy yoke doth bowe, With such good will as may not well be tolde, So faire a frend is worth her weight in gold. Thus much by mouth my mistresse wild me say, The rest (I iudge) this paper will bewray. The Ladies Letter of pittie to her afflictd friend, to whom she had been cruell As thou wilt muze to reade, so I might blush to write These lines of loue, who for goodwill haue fed thee with despite And from the day when thou becamst a thrall in loue, Could neuer spare one sparke of grace that was for thy behoue: Till now, both cleane against mine honour and mine vse, A Ladie, and a mayden both, I sende thee termes of truce. But listen well vnto the tale that I shall tell. Ere rashly thou my kindnesse deeme, and thinke I vse thee well. For Lions seldome sewe vnto the sillie sheepe, No porter to their captiues crouch, whom they in chaines doe keepe Few Ladies of estate, few Dames of hie degree, Doe bow vnto their vassals willes, as I doe now to thee. But knowe that though I write the wordes of great good will: Yet I regarde mine honour aye, and keepe my countnance still. No lust procurde my lynes, my credite to impaire: No fleshie fitte my fancie forst to speake Nastagio faire. But seeing how in seas of sorow and distresse, Thy body bathde for loue of me: I could not doe no lesse, But seeke to salue thy harmes by pitying thine anoy, Who, to possesse my liked limmes, bereft thy selfe of ioy. I saw howe for my sake thou wasted hadst thy welth, And planting battrie to my fort, wert retchlesse of thy health: Deuising how to raze the bulwarke of my brest, And scale the walles of my good will, whom thou didst fancie best, I plainly did perceiue (as Louers soone will see,) Howe thou forsookest thy natiue soyle, and all for loue of me: Quite carelesse of thy coyne, thy friendes and yeerely rents, Not forcing stately builded bowres, nor gallant garish tentes: Which when I flatly found, from fansie to proceede, (Although thou thoughtst me ouerproud) I pitied thee in deede. Yea Ioue shall be my iudge, when thou beganste to sewe, And in Rauenna wert inragde, and first to liking grewe: Thy courtly grace was such, so comly was thy corse, And all thy partes so pleasde mine eyes, as I had had remorse, And bended to thy bowe, saue that I dreaded guiles: My fearefull youth bid me beware, of mens mistrustfull wiles. Who faine to frie in loue, and melt with fansies flames: When their deuise is only how by craft to compasse dames. I reade in auncient bookes, how Iason playde the Iew, And to the Queene that savde his life, in fine was found vntrue: Not forcing her a figge, who for his sake forwent Both aged syre, and tender babes, and crowne by due descent. Againe I calde to minde how false Æneas fled, And left the curteous Carthage dame fast sleepiug in her bed: Whose bountie earst had bounde by det and due desart, When weatherbeaten he arrvide, this trayterous Troyans hart. Theu Theseus came to thought, and pranking Paris eake: Who like vnfaithfull fickle men, their sworne vowes did breake. Fayre Oenons wofull writ can witnesse of the tone: Thother from Ariadna fled and left her post alone. With sundrie suters mo, who being bound to loue, Saunce quarell good, or matter why, their likings did remoue: Renouncing to their shames, those Ladies, who did rewe Their base estates, and did relieue the men they neuer knewe These partes procurde my pawse, And wilde me to beware, Least I by giuing rash consent to loue, were trapt in snare. My loue was like to thine, I fryde with egall fire: But nature helpes vs to conceale the sparkes of our desire. Kinde aydes vs to conuey our fittes in finer wise: For honours sake, than men, who shew their fancies by their eyes, Which if we Ladies did, Defame would ring her bell, And blaze out armes in colours base although we meant but well. You men like Marchants are that set their wares to showe, Whereby to lure the lookers eyes that by your wyndowes goe, And sundrie times in steade of right and costly clothes, You vtter trash, and trifling stuffe, which euery chapman lothes. But we like Goldsmithes deale, that forge their plate within: Whose hammers plie the Anuil aye, and yet no working seen. No smoke nor smoother flies, for any to beholde, Untill the rude vnperfite masse be brouhht to burnisht golde. We worke, but all within, our hammers are not heard: We hotly loue, but keepe it close, for feare our match be marde, For who esteemes the mayde, or holdes the virgin pure: That standes a stale for euerie guest, and stoupes to euerie lure? Yea, be she maide or wife, if once her lookes be light, And that in sundrie suters tales she place her deepe delight: Downe is her credite cut with hatchet of mishap, Her honour hewde in peeces straight, by meane of open lap. O Goddes, what griefe were this vnto a noble minde? How would it vexe an honest Nymph, whose credite clearely shynde? For offer of goood will, with meaning not amisse: To beate the badge of Helen, or of Creside, for a kisse? Then ought not we (I pray) that noble maydens are, So guide our tender steppes of state, as vertue may prefarre, And place vs in the ranke, that is for Ladies dewe? Should we lende light beliefe to loue: or euery suter rewe? So might we reape the crop of care, and foule defame: Where earst we neuer meant to sowe the sinfull seedes of shame. I write not this of all that louing suters bee, Or in such sort, as though I thought the like deceit in thee, As earst in Iason was, or in the wandring Prince, And sundrie other Lordings mo, that haue bene louers since. One Swallow is no signe that Sommer time is come, No more must all Cupidos knightes be cast because of some, Birdes are not plumde alike, yet all birdes in kinde: So men are men: but yet in some more fickle partes we finde. I counte thee no such one as lightly will remoue: Thy lingring sute, my long delayes confirme thy faith in loue. Whom sith I finde so firme and stedfast in desire, As neither lowring lookes, nor lacke can make thee once retyre, Or folter in thy fayth, which thou hast vowde to me: Proceede in loue, but hast thee home, that I thy face may see. Plucke vp thy manly minde, and sprites forspent with woe: Drie vp the deaw that from thine eyes and drearie cheekes do flow: Doe barbe that boysterous beard: that ouergrowes thy face: Either cut, or kembe thy feltred lockes to mende thy manly grace. Put on thy golden gyte, and former fresh aray: Bestride thine auncient stately steede and quickly come away. Backe to Rauenna ride, euen there to purchase ioy, Where thou ere this (the more my blame) hast liude in great anoy. Forgo thy solemne walkes, bandon Classie wood: Leaue off to leade thy life in lawndes, imbrace thy townish good. Thou art no vowed Monke in Cloyster close to dwell: No Ancker thou enioynde with Beads, to hyde in simple Cell. But thou a comelie knight, in field a Martial man: And eke in time of peace, a wight that rule Rauenna can. Whefore as I enforst thy bale and causelesse care: And was the onely she that made thee mourne, and languish thare: So (good Nastagio) nowe let me reuoke thee thence: That hande that did the harme ere this nowe vse in thy defence. I shot, I must confesse, the dart that gaue the dynt, For which, lo here the blesseful balme, thy deadly griefes to stint. Surceasse thy wofull plaintes, discharge thy darke dispaire: The golden beames of my remorse, shall cleare thy cloudy ayre. When angry frowning foes encounter in the fildes, With murdering mindes, the stronger slaies. when once the weaker yeeldes. Up goes the wrathfull sworde into his sheath againe: The yeelding of the tone, doth cause that neuer a man is slaine. If weakest thus may winne by stouping to the strong, In combate fell for life and death: thou doest mee double wrong, That hold in virgins hand, thy bale and eke thy blisse, And am thy Queene, and only ioy, and frankly offer this: If thou my kindnesse scorne, and rather makste the choyce To spill thy gallaunt prime in plants, than with thy friendes reioyce. Thou seest how I do sue, to whom thou for suedst grace. Sith I doe pitie thy distresse, to hight thy dolefull case: Dispatch without delay, treade torments vnder foote, That mirth within thy mourning minde may take the deeper root. The banquet latelie made, where I beheld my cheere, And marckte thy moode from point to point, in whome did plaine appeare A kinde and constant heart, not bolstred vp with gyle: Enflamde my liuer so with loue, as I was forst to smyle. And had by outward shewes, bewraied thee my good will, Saue that my mother present was who markt my countenance still. I sawe, when we approcht, the tent amid the wood: How all thy guests reioyst thee, but twas I that did thee good, My presence bred delight, with thy blooming brest: And to dissemble liking thou, didst welcome all the rest. I markt at table how. thou slilie cast thine eie, On me askance, and caruedst too my mother by and by: As who would say, behold the meate I meant to thee, I am enforst to giue it here least they my fansie see. And when I raught the wine, and dranke my thyrst to quell, In self same peece how thou would pledge I yet remember well. I saw, when after meat wee parted home againe, How all thy former frolicke fit, was quickly changde to paine, My comming brought thee blisse, my parture made thee pine. My beatie for the time enflamde and heat that heart of thine. I saw (what wilt thou more) my presence was thy life, And how mine absence set thy wits at cruell warre and strife, Then sith thine eyes are bent to feed vppon my face, And that the want of my good wiil hath made thee runne this race: I rew thee now at last, I pitie thy distresse, I yeeld that thou the castle of thy comfort now possesse. I am no Lions whelpe, I suckt no Tigers teat, In spoyle of such as sewde for loue, delight I neuer set. I neuer pleasure tooke, in forcing foe to death. Much lesse my tender heart wil brooke to stoppe Nastagios breath. Time giues assurance good of thine vnfained trust: Thou bearst no treason in thy brest, thou hast no lechers lust. Whom sithence I haue tride in loue so perfect true: To quit thy faith, I am thy friend, reseruing honour due. If marriage loue thou meane, then franke consent I giue, To yeeld thee vp Dianas bowe. and loue thee whilst I liue. In Iunos ioyfull yoke, to ioyne and draw with thee: It likes me well, there rests no more but that my frends agree. Small sute shal serue the turne, for if they doe not yeeld: Then I my selfe enright thee with the conquest of the fielde, My selfe do keepe the key, where lies the iewell, which Is thy delight, and onely ioy whom thou desirst so much. But no mistrust I haue, thy motions are so good: Thy flocke, and state, so noble, as thou shalt not be withstood. Wherefore (O makelesse man) set all delayes aside, Thy Ladie loues, and is content to be thy bounden bride, Retire, thou retthlesse wight, whose lingring woundeth twaine: Two noble hearts shall thinke them blest, when thou returne againe, These wordes I wrote in bed, where oft I wisht for thee: Mine honour bids me pawse at that, as yet it must not be. Farewell, with Nestors yeeres, God sende thee happie daies: Remember, thou that louing mindes can broke no long delaies. Alas, for thee I die ten thousand times a day: My fits be fierce, my griefe is great, wherefore dispatch away. I wish thee Dadals wings, or Perseus praunsing steed, Or els the Cart that Phæton rulde, but better farre to speed. In heart I am thy wife, if that content thy will, Once more adeu, thy lingring long, thy faithfull friend will spill, Thy long beloued in RAVENNA. EVPHYMIA. Guerra ei mio stato, dira, e di duol piena. Vegghio, penso, ardo, piango. Eftsoone replyde the knight, with friendly face, With gladsome heart, &amp; trembling tong for ioy: Faire Nymph (quoth he) thy comming to this place Delights me much, and quits my great annoy. The thing, whereto thou saist I shall aspire, Is that which long Nastagio did desire, Thy message likes my minde exceeding well, And sith thy Ladie deales so friendly now With me her thrall, forget not thou to tell, That by the Gods I make a solemne vow, Not to abuse her honour or defile Her noble name by any wanton wile. My purpose is, in good and godly sort, To take her to my lawfull wedded wife, And so vnto the Lady make report, I sweare my selfe her husband during life: Doe giue my Loue this Amathiste from mee, As pledge that I ere long with her will bee: And for thy paines, loe here a slender summe, But better this, than no reward at all: I meane to friende thee more in time to come, Farewell (faire sweete) accept my guerdon small: The maid had money, thanks, and leaue to part, Whose answere made her Ladie light of heart. And thereupon withouten longer stay, Unto her friendes shee brake her whole intent, As touching marriage, and with all did pray With willing mindes that they would giue consent, Unfolding her effection to the man, And how in heart that onely course she ran. The aged parents of this willing wight, Perceiuing how their daughters minde was set, And knowing eke the fansie of the knight, Triumpht for ioy, and thought it sinne to let Such honest loue, or hinder marriage bande, The short is this, they wedded out of hand, A marriage day no sooner gone and paste, There were not in Rauenna man wife, If you had fitted all from first to last, In greater glee that wasted all their life: She shewde herselfe not halfe so hard before, But being matcht, she loude him ten times more. And not alone this one good turne befell Nastagio, through this sodaine forced feare, But diuers moe, that there about did dwell, Bepitied those that louing hearts did beare: And such as for good will had rigour showen, No more for foes, but louers would be knowen. The Lenuoy. Thrice happie those I deeme aboue the rest, That ground good will, and fixe affection so, As in the end it fall out for the best, Not broken off by fortune, nor by foe: Seedes wisely sowen will prosper well and growe. But where aduise and wholsome counsel wants, Trees may not proue, they perish in the plants Who makes his choice to loue in tender age. And scornes the skill of such as time hath taught, And headlong runnes at riot in his rage, Is like the birde in net by fowler caught, Bringing himselfe and all his wealth to naught: It cannot be but such as counsel scorne, Must needes at length be vtterly forlorne. The sicke that loathes to listen to his cure, And seekes no meane his maladie to cease, To die the death, for lacke of helpe is sure. The carelesse man is full of wretchednesse: So raging loue brings balefull end, vnlesse The patient plie, and lend a bending eare, Vnto his friend, that willes to forbeare. VVhich seldome when in frantike youth is found, In case of loue where pleasure strikes the stroke, They hate the plaister that should heale the wound, And like the beast runne willing to the yoke, That with his straightnesse sundrie times doth choke. The least anoy that fraile desires bestow, Is wracke of wealth, if quite the carcasse goe: Yea diuers times goodes, life, and al decayes, Through foolish luste, and wanton witlesse wil: So many be the driftes and double waies: That craftie dames doe put in practise still, As some they sotte, and other some thay kill. They little force, how raging louers rewe, So they themselues in peace the pageant vewe: Not much vnlike the wilie witted boy That tiles his trappe to take the subtile foxe, Who clappes his handes, and makes the greatest ioy, When he pecceiues fale Raynard in the stockes, And for his labour giues ten thousand mockes: So craftie Dames contented are to lute Men on to loue, but scorne them being sure. Their pranking beauties pricke them on to pride, Their feitured limmes bedeckt with natures die: Makes them followe rigour for their guide, And ouerlookes their friendes with haughtie eye, Who for their loues are euen at point to die: Without regarde of spoyle, or of expence, Deeming them selues quite cleare of all offence. As in this processe plaine is set to viewe, Wherein a heauie mistresse playde her parte, Right well content to let Nastagio rewe, And for good will to reape disdaine and smarte, That loude her from the bottome of his hearte: Who though were ritche, and noble by descent, Yet might not make her marble minde relent, By lingring loue she made his monie mealte, As waxe doth weare against the flaming fire: Through her disdaiue outragiously he dealt, Wasting his wealth to compasse fond desire, A great deale more than reason did require: She was the cause, for had not fancie bene: He would more neere vnto his profite seene. But womens beauties bleare the clearest eyes, Their feeble force makes weake the wisest wittes, Their limber chaines the sturdie Champion ties, The grauest sage is thrall to louing fitts, The rockiest brest with bolt Cupido hittes: And who so thinkes to scape most cleare away, Is soonest caught, and makes the longest stay. I coulde accompte Cupido for a God, When I respect his puissance and his might, If in his shaftes he were not found so odde, But would in case of liking deale aright, And force faire dames their louers to requite. But commonly when men in fansie burne. Then womens hartes are most vnapt to turne. When man both rage, his Ladie lies at rest, When he laments, she liues at quiet ease, She coldely loues, when he doth fancie best, And when she powtes, yet he must seeke to please, And make faire wether in tho roughest seas: Yea, and perhaps, at last when all is done, As farre to seeke as when he first begonne, As proues this noble man who hauing spente No slender summes in seruice of his loue, And barde himselfe, by racking of his rent: Yet could by no desert good lyking moue, In ruthlesse brest no pitties plantes might proue, Till feare of harmes her late repentance wrought, She could to clothe by no deuise be brought: But when in fine this bloody broile she sawe, And plainely vewde, amid the open groue The Ladies plagues: then was she pincht with awe Of like successe then little Cupide stroue Within her bulke, because that she had moue The web that wrought Nastagio all his woe: And thereupon she lette to be his foe. Then fell she flatte to fansie out of hande, Than sent she messege to bewray her mynde, Then did she let Nastagio vnderstande, How that she meant no more to be vnkinde, But willing was her selfe in matche to binde: Whereby we see that sundry things are done, By force of feare, which wit had neuer wonne. But sure good will of feare that takes his grounde, But badly proues, a fansie forst in harte Full lightly fades, and seldome when is sounde, With euery heate tis ready to departe, It doth resemble colours made by arte. The franke consent in loue tis euer best, Whom meere affection breedes in yeelding brest. Faire Ladies, beare with what I vtter here, Concerning women, and their deepe disgrace, I gyrde the coye, I leaue the curteous cleare. And this I say: who fawnes vpon the face Of any dame, and reape, a scornefull grace: Were she as braue as Paris Ladie was, For louing so he proues himselfe an Asse. Who serues sot, and bowes at euery becke, Without the guerdon that to loue is dewe, And playes his game at chesse to gayne a checke, Deserues the mate that doth the checke ensewe, Because he scornes his mischiefe to eschewe: And she that hath a perfite friend to trust, Deserues a plague, if she be found vniust. You stately Dames, that peacocklyke do pace, Through pride abusing such as are your thralls, Enforcing them for lacke of better grace, Unto their bane, which sundrie times befalles, Not finding salue to cure their griefull galles: Euphymias plagues imprinte in heedefull mynde, And looke for like, if you be found vnkynde. Amachitama. Minor pana Tantall ne linferno Pate, che chi di donna sta al gouerno. [Nicocrates a cruell tyrant, slewe] The Argument to the second Hystorie. Nicocrates a cruell tyrant, slewe Sir Fadimus, who had vnto his wife One Aretafila, of gallant hewe, And after, (hauing reft the husb?ds life) Did wedde this dame who though were made a queene Might not forget the murther she had seene. No loue deuise, no iewels fet from farre, Could so reclaime this noble Ladies minde, But that she would aduenture him to marre, Who slevv her knight, whereat she so repinde: By poisoned drinke she meant to do the deede, But that was found; it might not vvel succeede. The tyrants mother Caluia, tygreleeke, Procurde her plagues, and torments diuersly, For that the Queene to slay her sonne did seeke, But vvisely she did slacke this crueltie: And made him thinke her sirupe vvas to proue, Where she might force in him a greater loue. Which shift allovved, she more in credit grevv, The king forgaue, but she could not forget, But once againe deuisde a drifte anovve. VVhich as she thought, might lightly haue no let The king a brother had, a vvilfull vvight, Bente all to loue, and he Leander hight. This Ladie bare by Fedimus of yore, A daughter faire, vvhom she by practise sought, To couple with Leander euermore, Which macht at l?gth with much ado was wroght Then all the mothers skil, and daughters drifte, Was by this youth, the king fr? crown to lifte. By day the Queen the daughter did perswade, The wife by night did play her part so well, As in a while these two Leander made To vndertake to rid this tyrant fell: No dew regard of bloud, no care of kinde, Could stay the fact, this Princoxe was so blinde. The king was slaine by cruell brothers hande. The realme releast of such bloudie foe, Leander then did gouerne all the lande, The hope was great that matters wel should goe: But wh? this youth had once atchiude the state, He scornde the Queene, &amp; al her friends forgate. Puft vp with princely pride, he wore the crown, And lawlesse liude, so neare his brothers trade, As needefull was to seeke to put him downe: And thereupon the Queene this practise made, She hirde for coyne, a noble man at armes, To slay her sonne, to salue her countries harmes. This warlike Captaine came from Libie lande, Who tooke by force this tyrant coward king. And gaue him vp into his mothers hande: A Noble dame that compast twice to bring Her realme to reste, and rigour to subdewe. Lo here the summe, the processe doth ensewe. VVithin Cyrene earst there dwelling was a Dame Namde Aretafila, of birthe and noble bloud she came, Elator was her Syre, a man of great renowne: Sir Fædimus her husband hight, the chiefe in all the towne For noble minde and wealth: this Ladie was so well With bewtie dighte, as she the reste not onely did excell For feature of her face, that was full fayre to looke, But eke for graue Mineruas giftes, and cunning in her booke: Her sacred giftes were great, her wisdome was as rare, As was her face, for fewe with her in learning might compare. What time this Ladie liude, a tyrant fierce and fell, Nicocrates, possest the lande where did this matron dwell. Who many of the men that in the Citie were, Did do to fowle and shamefull death, he kept them all in feare. They wist not what to doe: Apollos priest he slewe, His handes he nothing stucke with bloud of prophets to imbrue, Whom shame, and sinne it was with rigour to entreate, Respecting what their office was, and why they kept the seate. At length this cruell king thus hauing sundrie slaine. To trap Sir Fædimus in snare did beate his wilie brayne, And neuer gaue it off, till he had wrought his will: He thirsted for his bloud, whom he without offence did kill. And after husbands death, this noble dame did wedde: Who had as leuer lost her life, as layne in tyrants bedde. But force did take effect, to striue it booted nought, (For tyrant lust doth stande for lawe) to yeelde it best she thought. So monstrously his minde too bloudie deedes was bent, As sauing death without deserte might nothing him content. And looke as many as he forced so to die, Hee caused to be carried out, without the walles to lie, Amid the open fieldes, that they might neuer haue, The reuerence to corses due, nor honour of the graue. His Subiects when they sawe him bath him so in blood, And that to slay the giltlesse wight it did this monster good, Some, to auoide his handes, did make in wise they were Quite voide of life, to the ende they might be borne on the beare, And carried to the fielde, where dead did vse to lie, They thought them blest that by this wile could bleare the Princes eie. At length this subtile shift, the cruell king perceiude, And saw how to escape his scourge, they had him long deceyude: To worke a surer way, at euery gate there was Appointed one, with charge to looke that no man there might passe, In colour of the dead, who cause he did not trust The bearers with his naked sworde the bodies vsde to thrust Through coffin where they lay, to make the matter sure: This great outrage of his, the Queene no longer coulde endure. But verie much mislikte these Tyrants trickes, and had Compassion of her natiue soyle, and woulde been very glad With hazard of her life to rid this monster quight, For hatred which shee bare to him that murthred so the knight Whom shee full dearely loude: and albeit the king Made very great account of her, yet did shee minde the thing Which shee conceiude before and purposde in her breast, And till shee had atchieude the same, could neuer liue at rest. And though the Prince his power this dayly greater grewe, Had bred the Subiects to dispayre their freedome to renewe, Or euer safe to liue within their natiue land, Where such a cruell king did holde the scepter in his hand: Yet did this noble dame conceiue a greater trust, To finde a time to worke her feate, which eyther doe shee must And so at freedome set her countrie men againe, And venge her louing husbands death, or let them all be slaine, As hee, good knight, had beene. To pricke her on the more, Shee cald to minde the practise of a Theban dame before, That wise Faræa hight: for doing of the which, The valiant women wan renowme, and was commended much. Whom shee had great desire to follow in this deede; But when shee saw for lack of aide and helping hands at need, (Which tho the Theban had,) shee could not doe the leeke: Shee meant to doe it with a thing that was not farre to seeke. Deuising by a drinke, to rid the Tyrants life, Who slue her husband by deceite and forst her to his wife. A poyson she preparde, whereby as I shall tell, In present perill of her life this ventrous Ladie fell. For still her purpose failde, and being in the end Discouered, and the matter found, which shee did then pretende, Dissembling could not serue to salue the sore againe. For what good heart she bare the king did then appeare too plaine. The Tyrants mother eke, that Madame Caluia hight, Not louing Aretafila, (a dame of great despight) Full fit to breede a babe of such a blooddie minde, (For children commonly are like vnto the mothers kinde) Perswaded, that to death this Ladie should be done, As one that did pretend the spoyle, and slaughter of her sonne. But what the great good will to her the Prince did beare, And answere bold that shee had made with vsage voyde of feare, Before the mother Queene, who there in open place, Accusde her of her murther ment, there standing face to face, Did quit her from the death. But when the proofe was such, And euidence so plaine appearde, so that shee mought not much Excuse her of the fact, but that the poysoned cup, Was made by her, and meant vnto the king to drinke it vp: There Aretafila, before the Iudges face, In presence of the Prince her spouse, did thus declare the case. My Soueraigne Lord and Loue, I cannot doe no lesse, But, that this cup I did procure, before thee now confesse. My selfe the syrrope made, and meant to giue it thee: But this I will protest againe, not knowing it to be, A venim rancke and vile, but verily did thinke By cunning to deuise this cup, and make a craftie drinke To cause a man to loue: for knowe you this, that I Am spited at, of sundrie that my marriage doe enuie. It greeues a number, that you beare me such good will, It is a gall to some to see that I shoulde haue my fill Of treasure and attyre and be a Prince his wife, And they themselues to liue vnknowne, and lead a priuate life. I knowe they cannot well my haphy state endure, But that they will at length deuise your friendship to allure, And cause you cast me off: which was the cause that I Did brewe this drinke to keepe good wil. I thought it good to trye By art to stay a friend, whom I by fortune wonne; And if so be I did offend, you cannot deeme it donne For malice, but good will, for hatred, but for zeale: Why should I then condemned be that neuer meant to deale But as a louing wife? And if your pleasure be I shall bee punisht for my fault, yet doe account of me Not as a witch, that woulde bereaue you of your life, But one that by enchauntment thought to make your Loue your wife, And match her in good will that doth extreemely loue: And who, to be belovde alike, dyd meane this sleight to proue. When thus the Matron had, with manly mouth and grace Ypleaded for her selfe, the Prince to whom pertaind the case, Well liking this excuse, woulde not in any wise That shee, who was his wife, shoulde die: but this he did deuise, That there shee should be rackt till time shee would confesse The truth, and what shee meant thereby in open place expresse. When torment readie was, and rack there set in place, Then cankred Caluia, plaide her part, and laid her on a pace, Untill shee wearie woxe: shee longed for her blood, Which made her earnest in the case, and plague the Queene a good. But Aretafila, as one that forced nought Of all the paines shee had indurde, discouered not her thought: She nothing would confesse, but kept it in her minde, And hereupon deliuerde was. Nicocrates could finde, No due desart of death. Then grew within his breast A great remorse for rigour showne to her he loued best, Whom he without offence had put to cruell paine. Wherefore within a space the king began to loue againe: And fansie her as fast, deuising sundry shiftes, To winne her olde good will, he gaue her many goodly gifts. She could not want the thing the tyrant had in store, Who then but Aretafila, whom he had rackt before? And she that was full wise, by countnance and by cheare, Did make as though she did embrace and helde the tyrant deare: But still in store she kept within her wrathfull minde, Remembrance of reuenge, till she fit time and place might finde. And in her head she cut the patterne of his paine, How, if occasion servde she mought auenge her husbande slaine. By Fedimus she bare whilste he yet liuing was, A daughter that for honest life and beautie braue did passe. And so befell it, that the king a brother had, Leander namde, a wilfull youth, and eke a wanton lad, Much giuen to the loue of light alluring dames, To whom, as to a byting fish, a bayte this mayden frames, To take him by the lippe, by sorcerie she wrought, And cuppes that cause a man to loue: whereby this youth she brought Into her subtil net: thus was Leander caught By loue deuises, that the Queene vnto her daughter taught. This damsel hauing woonne Leander to her lure, So traynde him on, as she at last the Princesse did procure The tyrant to request, to yeelde him his desire, As touching mariage of the Mayde, that set his minde on fire: Who when Leanders loue and purpose vnderstoode, To Aretafila to breake the same he thought it good. She willing was thereto, as one that wrought the wile: Nicocrates perceiuing that, denying it a while, Yet graunted at the length: not willing to be seene An enemie vnto the mayde, the daughter of the Queene, When all good willes were got, the mariage day drew neare, Untill Leander wedded was, he thought it twentie yeere. To make the matter short, I leaue for you to scan, Both of the maydens rich attyre, and iewels of the man. I leaue the musike out, I let the banket go: I speake not of the noble men that were at wedding tho. I write not of the wine, nor of the daintie cates, Assure your selues there w?ted naught that fitted royal states. When wedding day was done, the wife to chamber went, And after her Leander came: where they in pleasure spent The night, as custome is, and maried folkes do vse: And selfe same pleasure night by night from that day forth ensues. The lately wedded wife behaude her selfe so well, That still Leander ten times more to doting fansie fell. Which when she vnderstoode, a wench of wily witte, To set her purpose then abroch, she thought it passing fit. A fyled tale she framde, and thus begun to speake: Mine own (quoth she) the great good wil I beare you, makes me breake My minde and meaning nowe: The carke and care I haue, Is causer that I will you from your brothers sword to saue Your life, whilste yet you may: you see his monstrous minde, And how his hatefull tyrants heart is all to blood inclinde. You know his cruell deedes, I shall not neede recite The sundry men that he hath slaine vpon a meere despight: You viewe the gorie ground, where yet the bodies lie, You see how tyrant like he deales, you see with daily eye, Such vndeserued deathes as wo it is to tell: In my conceite, if you should seeke, his spoyle, you did but well. It were a worthie deede, and well deseruing prayse, To murther him, and reaue his realme, that so his subiects slayes. To rid your natiue soyle of such a monster, may Not onely gaine immortall fame that neuer shall decay: But winne you such good will, in countrie and in towne, As by the meanes thereof, you may attaine the royall crowne, Which now your brother weares against the peoples will, Who would (no doubt) elect you prince, if you the tyrant kill. To quit so good a turne, and noble deede withall. But if you let him raigne a while, I feare, at last you shall Repent your long delay: your state is neuer sure, As long as he, the monster liues, he will your bane procure. What thraldome like to yours? howe wretched is your life? Haue you forgotten how you sude to him, to take a wife? Fie, shame, Leander, fie, I greatly disalow, That you who are his brother, should vnto your brother bow. Put case he owe the crowne, is that a cause that you May not go marry where you list, but must be forst to sue So like a boy, for leaue to choose your selfe a make? Oh that I were a man, I would enforce the beast to quake. Leander, if you loue or make account of me, Bereaue the monster of his life: my mother longs to see The slaughter of her so, that slue my father earst. With these her wordes Leander felt his heart so throughly pearst, As vp from bed he flew, with minde to murther bent. To sucke his brothers bloud, ere long this wilfull marchant ment. Leander had a friend whom he did loue as life, Callde Danicles, to whom he rode and tolde him what his wife Had willde him take in hande, wherein his ayde he must In whom especially he did repose assured trust. Leander with his friend, when time and place did serue, Nicocrates the tyrant slue, as he did well deserue. And hauing done the deed, achieude the kingly Crowne, He strake the stroke, and ruler was, and gouernde all the towne. Thus he in office plaste, puft vp with princely might, Not forcing Aretafila, his mother law awhit, Nor any of hir blood, once hauing got the raigne, Did all the worlde to vnderstande by that his high disdaine, That he his brother slue for rancour and despight: Not for desire his Countrey soyle from tyrants handes to quight. So loathsome all his lawes, so straunge his statutes were, Such folly in his roysting rule, as made the people feare, Their former foe to haue bene raysde to life againe, Who was not many dayes before by this Leander slaine. When Aretafila sawe howe the game did go, And that Leander in his sway did vse the matter so, And proudly rulde the realme, esteeming her so light, Who hoped by his brothers death the countrie had bene quight Releast of tyrants rage: when she perceiude (I say) Howe haughtily his heart was bent, she meant her part to play: In ridding of the realme of such a cruel king, That kept his subiects so in awe, and vnder yoke did wring: A fresh report was blowne of one Anabus, bred In Libie lande, a Martial man that all his life had led In face of foraine foes: with him this wily dame Did practise, and such order tooke, as he with army came Leander to subdue: who being nigh at hand, With mightie troupe of warlike wights, to ouercom the land: The Queene, his mother lawe, as one that were dismaide, To worke her wile, Leander cald, and thus to him shee said: Loe here (good sonne) you see how nie your mightie foe, Is come to bid you battaile, and your Captaines are (you know) Not to be matcht with his: behold what men they are: Well skild in feats that touch the fielde, and traind in trade of warre. Your souldiers are but sheepe, for battaile farre vnfit: Besides their pollicies are great, your Captaines haue no wit To deale in such a case that toucheth Princes state: Againe, there commes no honour by such brawles, and broyling hate: Consider with your selfe, you scarsly haue as yet Good footing gotten in your raigne, vnstable (sonne) you sit. And like to take a fall: whereof if womans braine May giue good counsaile to the wise, I would (I tell you plaine,) Your foe and you were friendes: I would allow it well, If you with Captaine Anabus to truce and concord fell. I doe presume on this, and dare to vndertake, That you shall safely come to talke, by meanes that I will make With him that is your foe: the wordes his mother spake, Leander liked verie well and in good part did take. Desirous of a parle. but ere the pointed day Of talke betwixt the Captaines came, she sent a Poast away, A messenger of trust, Anabus to entreate, That when Leander issude out, then he should worke his feate, And either slay him there, by force in open fielde, Or vnto her, the cruell king in chaines a captiue yeeld: In recompence whereof She made a large behest, Of gold that she would franklike giue: whereto this greedie gest, The Lybian man of warre, full gladly lent his care. Leander (as the nature is of Tyrants) stood in feare, Deferring day of parle, vnwilling foorth to goe, But Ladie Aretafila still lay vpon him so, As very shame at last did further this intent: And shee, to egge him on the more, made promise if he went. To set her foote by his, and looke the foe in face: Which moude Leander very much, and mended well the case. So out at length they passe, disarmd he and his, As one that meant to treate of truce, for so the custome is. Anabus seeing this, to counter him began, And with his power approched neare: Leander fearfull man Would gladly made a stop, and gazde about the place: To viewe his gard that should assist and helpe in needfull case. But how much more he seemde to linger on the way: So much the more his mother lawe, by words, that shee did say As touching his reproch, of fearefull cowards heart, Did pricke Leander, onward still, not letting him to part. At Length the Lady, when of force he would haue staid, Upon the wretched dastard wight his feeble fingers laid: And by the ayde of men whom there shee had in place, She brought him bound both hand &amp; foot, before Anabus face. And captiue gaue him vp, to liue in lothsome holde, Untill the Queene, as promise was, hee payd him all his golde. Then he eftsoone retyres vnto the towne againe, Declaring what successe she had and what a spitefull paine Shee tookeor eare shee could that blooddie beastlie king Depose and rid him from the realme, and so to bondage bring. The people passing glad that he was so displaste, Did make a common purse, to pay the Lybian Duke in haste: Who hauing told the crownes, did send Leander backe, Unto the Queene: and shee enclosde the monster in a sacke, And causd him to be cast, from off a mountaine hie, Into the Sea, to drowne the beast that wel deserude to die. Then Calnya, shee was caught, and to a piller tied, And there the cruell croked queane, with flaming fagots fried, Till all her aged bones, to ashes were consumde, That oft in youth with Ciuet sweete and Amber were perfumde. When all this broile was done, the townesmen in a ranke, Kneeld downe to Aretafila, and highly did her thanke, For freedome got againe, with perill of her life. I neede not here expresse the ioyes of maiden, man, and wife. For all reioyst alike, mot one in all the towne, Nor countrie, but was glad at heart that they had wonne the crowne Into their hands againe, and shapte the Tyrants scourge, Then gan they all with one consent the aged dame to vrge, With helpe of chosen men, to gouerne all the land: For vantage of the publike weale, she tooke the charge in hand. Because we lightly see when Peeres and Princes faile, Then runnes the common welth to wreck, as shippe without a saile. But when she saw the realme at good and quiet stay: And vnderstood that commons did with willing minds obay Unto their lawfull heads, the Senate she bethought, To take the gouernment a fresh: her selfe vnfit she thought To deale in case of state, then tooke they all the charge, And did the Ladie from the crowne, and troubles quite discharge. Thus hauing rid the realme of two such blooddie foes, Into a Nunnrie, there to ende her life this Ladie goes. Where she deuoutly dwelt, and to her praiers fell: And as shee liude in vertue earst, so dide shee very well. The Lenuoy. VVho sits aloft in sacred Princes seate, And wieldes his realme by loue and not by dread Whose puisant hand by auldnesse doth intreate The silly rowte that vnder him is led: Shall safely raigne, and hold his scepter sure, A courteous king doth lightly long endure. But who so raignes in threatning tyrants throne, Bathing in blood his haughtie hungrie chaps, And rules by force, is surely ouerthrowne. The Goddes assigne such Soueraines sory haps, It may not lost, that so exceedeth reason, The truest hearts, by force are brought to treason. A pleasant porte doth rule a raging horse, When harder brakes doe breake the mouth too much, And makes the colt to steare with all his force: Rough handed Surgeons make the patient grutch. The Pilote that by skyll the shyp doth guide, And not by myght, makes vessels brocke the tyde. A lawlesse peere by law deserues to die, True iustice payes the blooddie home their hyre, And blood mispilt for vengeance aye doth crie, Lex talionis doth the lyke requyre: As in this tale that heere my Muse hath told, Of brothers two each man may well behold. Could Dyonisius deale with greater force? Or fearefull Phalaus with more despite? Than did Nycocrates without remorse That slew hys [illeg.] subiects lawlesse quight? Did not Leander deale in monstrous wise, Whom brothers blood might not alone suffyce? Prease hither Peeres, whose heads with crownes are clad Who hold the kingly scepters in your hands: Behold the end that blooddie tyrants had, A mirrour make of these to rule your landes: With all, see heere a Ladies manly minde, Whom God to wreake this bloodshed had assignde. Marke how the fyrst was blinded all with blood, The husband slayne, and sundrie moe beside, To wed the wife this monster thought it good, Note how the Gods herein theyr scourge dyd hide, For who but he woulde trust a wronged wyght, Or place her in his naked bed at night? Looke how Leander lewde by wyle was wonne, And led by lust to worke his brothers woe: And more than that see how this beast did runne A wicked race and woxe his mothers foe. Note how the heauens made leuell yet at last, And plagude by death his blooddy dealings past. Aut sero, Aut citius. [Gentile loude one Nicoluccios wife] The argument to the third Historie. Gentile loude one Nicoluccios wife, Faire Catiline, a matrone graue and wise: Whom to corrupte sith he might not deuise, He parted thence to leade a grauer life. For she was bent to scorne such masking mates, As houerd still about her husbands gates. Within a while this Nicoluccio, (His Ladie great with childe) was forst to ride In haste from home, and leaue her there as guide: Whome sodayne griefe assaylde by fortune so, As Phisicke, friends, and all that sawe the chance, Did yelde her dead, she lay in such a traunce. The senslesse corse was to the Church c?ueide, And buried there with many a weeping eye: The brute was blowne abrode both faire &amp; nye. Reporte once spread, is hardly to be stayde. Gentile hearing how the matter went, His Ladies losse did bitterly lament. At length when teares had well dischargde his woe, And sorrowe slakte, a friend of his and hee, Tooke horse, &amp; rode by night, that none might see Whether they ment, or wherabout to goe. To Church he came, dismounted from his horse, He entred in, and vp he tooke the corse, With full intent to dallie with the dead, Which he in life by suite could neuer winne: He colde, he kist, he handled cheeke and chinne. He left no limme vnfelte from heele to head: So long he staide, at last the infant steerd Within her wombe, whereby some life appeerde. By fellowes helpe he bore the body thence, Home to his aged mother where she dwelt: Who moude to ruthe, with her so frendly delt, As to reuiue her, sparde for expence, She could not vse her owne with greater care, So choyse her cheere, so daintie was hir fare. VVhen time was come for nature to vnfolde Her coferd ware: this dame was brought a bed, And by Gentiles meanes had happily sped: And he forthwith a solemne feast did holde, VVhere, to the husband, both the wife and boy Surrendred were, to his exceeding ioye. Bologna is a towne of Lumbardie you know, A citie very brauely builte, and much set out to shewe: Where as in auncient dayes a famous knight there dwelde, Who for good giftes and linage both all others farre excelde: A man commended much, Gentile was his name. This worthy gallant fell in loue by fortune, with a dame That Catilina hight, one Nicoluccios wyfe, A passing faire, and featurde wenche, and ledde an honest life, And loude her husband so, as she did little waye The frendship of enamored youthes, nor ought that they could say. This Gentleman that sawe the Ladies faithfull breast, And how he might by no deuice to him her fansie wrest, Nor enter in her grace, whom he did loue so well, Nor by good seruice gaine good will, to deepe despaire he fell. And hereupon vnto Modena he retyrde, And bore an office in the towne, as one there to desyrde. It fortunde on a time when Nicoluccio rode From home, as touching his affaires, and that his wife abode A three myles off the towne, where he had buylte a graunge, To make her mery with her friendes, and eke the ayre to chaunge: Then being great with childe, not many weekes to goe: This Lady had a great mishap, as here my pen shall showe. A griefe, I wote not what, with such a sodayne force And monstrous might, befell the dame, and conquerde sore her corse As in the Ladies limmes no sparke of life appeerde, And more than that, another thing there was, that most discheerde Her kinsfolkes then in place: for such as had good sight And skill in Physike, deemde her dead, and gaue her ouer quight. And thereupon her friends that wiste howe matters went By her report in time of life, and howe that she had spent Not full so many monthes as giue a babee breath, And make it vp a perfect childe: when once they sawe her death. Not making farther searche, in case as there she laye, Unto a Church, not farre from thence, the carkasse did conuay, And gaue it there a graue, as Ladies vse to lye. The bodie being buried thus, a friende of his did hye Him to Gentile straight, to tell him of the newes, Who though was fardest fr? her grace, yet could none other chuse But sorrowe at her death. When greatest greefe was past, And that he had be thought awhile, thus out he brake at last. Loe (Lady) lo, (quoth he) nowe art thou dead in graue, Nowe (Madame Catilina) I, who during life could haue Not one good frendly looke, nor sweete regarding eye, Will be so bolde to steale a kisse as you in coffin lie. Nowe booteth do defence, you cannot now resist: Wherefore (assure thee) Lady nowe, thou shalt be sweetely kist. Howe dead soeuer thou arte, nowe will I take delight. And hauing tolde his tale, the day withdrewe, and made it night: Then taking order howe he mought, that none might see, Dispatche and goe vnto the place, his trustie frend and hee, Upon their geldings mounte, and neuer made a staye Untill they came vnto the Church, where dead the Ladie laye: Where being lighted off their horses, in they goe, And vp they brake the coffyn straight, and he that loude her so, Laye by the Ladies side, and clapte his face to hers, And lent her many a louing kisse, and bathde her breast with teares, Lamenting very sore. But as we daily see, The lust of man not long content, doth euer long to bee, Proceeding farther on: but moste of all the rest, The fonde desire of such as are with raging loue possest. So he that had resolude no longer there to staye, But doe his feate, and home agayne, thus to himselfe gan saye: Oh, sith I nowe am here why should I idle stande? Why doe not I this breast of thine imbrace, and feele with hande? I neuer after this, shall touch it so againe, Nor neuer mynde, Gentile thus proceeding in his vaine, Into her bosome thrust his hande beneath her pappe, And staying there a little space, did feele a thing by happe Within her wombe to wagge, and beat against her brest: Whereof at first he woxe amazde, but after repossest Of wittes and sense againe a further triall hee Did make, and then he found the corse, not thorough dead to bee, Though little were the life, yet some he knew for trouth, To rest within the Ladies limmes: wherefore the gallants both, From out the coffyn tooke this lately buried corse, And vp they leapte in all the poast. and layde her on the horse Before the saddle bowe, and home in haste they ride, Both to recouer life againe, and fearing to be spyde. Thus closely was she brought within Bologna walles, Unto Gentiles house, where he vpon his mother calles, Requesting her to helpe, the case required haste. His mother being graue and wyfe, receiude the corse as fast As she good matron mought: which deede of pitie done, Both who she was, and what had hapt, demaunded of her sonne: Who tolde her all the newes, and how the fortune fell, Which when the matron vnderstood, and wist the matter well: To ruth and mercy moude, (as is a womans guise) Shee makes her fire, she heats her bathes and so the carkas plyes, With chafing vp and downe, and rubbing euerie vaine: As shee at last had made the life and senses come againe: Her wandring wits retyrde, that earst had been astray, And being thus reuiude, at length thus sighing gan shee say: Alas, where am I nowe? what place is this (quoth shee?) Gentiles chearfull mother saide, a place full fit for thee, With that shee somewhat woxe aduisde, but wist not where Shee was bestead, when that at last she sawe Gentile there: Amazed in her minde, requested of the dame To tell her of the case, and how vnto her house she came. Gentile thereupon the whole discourse begonne, And did vnfold from point to point how euerie thing was done. Whereof she wofull woxe and pensiue for a space. But yet at length shee gaue him thankes for all his former grace And curtesies imployde: and as he euer bore A true and faithfull heart to her in all her life before, And as he was a man in whom good nature were: So did shee craue him that shee might not be abused there: But safely be conuaide vnto her graunge againe, And to her husbandes house vntouchte without dishonours staine. To whom Gentile thus replide: Well dame (quoth hee) How great soeuer the loue hath been which I haue borne to thee, Before this present day, I doe not purpose now, Nor after this at any time, (since God would this allowe Me grace to saue thy life, and raise thee from the pit: And loue which I haue alwayes meant to thee hath caused it:) I purpose not, I say, to deale in other wise, Than if thou were my sister deare, this promise shall suffice. But this good turne that I haue done to you this night, Doth well deserue, that you the same in some respect requight. Wherefore I shall desire that you with willing brest, Wyll friendly graunt me my demaunde, and yeeld me one request. Whereto the humble dame agreed, and was content, If so shee coulde, and honest were the sute Gentile ment. Then spake the courteous knight, Well (Madame) this is true, That both your parents and your friends of Boline, thinke that you Are buried low enough in coffin closlie layde, None tarries you at home as now, they all doe deeme you dead, Wherefore my small request and simple sute shalbe, That with my mother here to stay yee will vouchsafe, and me, In secrete and vnseene, vntill such time as I May to Modena goe and come againe, I meane to hie. The cause that makes me craue and aske this lingring stay, Is, that in presence of the best, and chiefe that beare the sway Within the towne, I minde to giue you as a gift, And to present you to your spouse, this is my only drift. The Ladie knowing that Gentile was her friend, And saw that honest was his sute, did quickly condescend: Though greatly shee desirde, new brought to life againe, To see and comfort those her friends that mournde for her amaine: Shee promist on her faith, with her to tarrie there. And yer her tale was throughly told, her time was come to beare The Babe wherewith shee went, shee must to trauaile straight The Matron euer at an inch did on this Ladie waite: And vsde the matter so, as in a day or twaine, She was deliuerde of a boy, and ouercame her paine. Whereat Gentile ioyde, and eke the dame that had Such great good hap and passing lucke, did waxe exceeding glad. The knight disposde his things, and vsde the matter so, As shee had been his wedded wife: and thereup? did goe Unto Modena, where an office he had borne, And there he staied vntill such time as all his yere was worne. And selfe same day that he accompted on, to make Returne vnto his mothers house at Boline, he bespake. That diuers of the states, and chiefest men that were Within the towne, should be his guestes. there was of purpose there, That Nicoluccio, who did owe this gentle dame. As soone as to his mothers house this lustie gallant came, The master of the feast dismounted, in hee hyes: Where, when among his other guestes, the Ladie he espies, And eke her sucking sonne, that hung vpon her breast, Hee was the meeriest man aliue: Then plaste he euery guest In order as their state and calling did require, There wanted not a deintie dish that Courtiers could desire: When washing time drewe nye, and euery man at boorde Had vittled well, and all was whiste, and no man spake a worde: The Ladie being taught her lesson long ere that, And well instructed in the case, and knowyng what was what, Gentile thus begunne his solemne tale to tell: My Lords and guestes (quoth hee) I like the order passing well That men of Persie vse: for when they make a feast, In honour of their friends, whom they doe loue and fansie best, They bid them to their house, and set before their eyes The chiefest iewell which they haue, and good, of greatest price, What thing soeuer it be: his wife, with whom he sleepes, His daintie daughter, or his wench, whome hee for pleasure keepes. He nothing hides as then, or locks from open sight: Affirming by this deede of his, that likewise (if he might) He woulde vnfold the heart that lyes within his breast, Which custome I in Bologne minde to practise to my guest. You honour this my feast with noble presence here, And I will play the Persians part: looke what I hold most deare, And chiefly doe esteeme, or fauour in my heart, Or euer shall regard or weigh, will show you or you part. But first I shall request or ere I bring it out, That you will heere decide a case, and rid me out of doubt Which I myselfe will moue. There is a noble man, Who hath a seruant in his house that doth the best he can To please his masters minde, hee doth at nothing stick: This trustie painfull seruant falles at length exceeding sicke, The retchlesse master, not regarding him at all, Nor forcing what by such disease his seruant may befall, Conuayes him out of doore, in open streat to lie, To sinke or swimme, to mende or paire to liue or els to die. A Straunger commes by happe, and hee to mercy moude, To see the poore diseasde soule so slenderly beloude, In danger of his death, to lie amids the streat: A place for such as are in paine. too cold and farre vnmeete: Doth beare him to his home, and takes such tender care Of him, and plies him so with fire and comfortable fare, As both recouers limmes and gettes his former strength, And settes this feeble seruant vp vpon his legges at length: Now gladly would I learne which of these both doth best Deserue to haue this seruaunt, who was lately so distrest? Where he that ought him first and gaue him off in grief, Or he that pitied him in paine and holpe him to relief? And if the maister, who so cruelly did deale In time of sicknesse, will the man that did his seruant heale, To yeelde him vp againe, where he by lawe and right May well with-hold the seruant, whom he holpe in wretched plight? The gentlemen among themselues debated harde, But drewe in one selfe string at length the matter was refarde To Nicoluccio, who (because he could full well Discerne of matters, and his tale in skilfull order tell) Should giue the verdit vp. He highly did commend The vse of Persia, with the rest concluding in the end, Which was, that he whom first this silly soule did serue, Of right could lay no lawfull clayme: full ill he did deserue A maisters name, that when his seruant was at worst, Would turne him off, and let him lie: but he, that when the furst Had played this cruell parte, did curteously entreate The sicke and outcast, ayding him with Phisicke and with meate, He mought by law and righte, no preiudice at all Done to the first, enioy the man, and him his seruant call. Then all the other guestes that at the banquet were, Affirmde the same that Nicoluccio had pronounced there. The knight who moude the case, as one that was content With such an answere, and the more, for that with him it went, Concluded, that he thought as all the other saide: And now (quoth he) I thinke that I sufficiently haue stayde. Now time it is that I performe my promise made, In that I meant to honour you, as is the Persians trade. With that he calls to him a couple of his friendes, Familiar, and of greatest trust, whom he in message sendes Unto the Ladie, that was clad in braue araye, Within a chamber, willing hir that she would come her way, To cheere his Royall guestes, with presence of her selfe. The Ladie taking in her armes that litle puling elfe, That was so lately borne, came in, and thother too Attending on her, and as earst Gentile willde her doe, She sate her downe beside a guest, a Noble man, And then the Knight that made the feast his processe thus began. Loe, Lordings, here beholde the thing whereof I spake, This is the iewell, whereof I such great accompt doe make, And euer doe entend, of nothing else so much I force, as this: now iudge your selfes, where it be worthy such Regard as I bestowe: marke euery member well: With that the states, to honor of this featurd Ladie sell, And praisde her very much, affirming to the Knight, That sinne it were not to esteeme so fayre and braue a wight. The guestes begonne to gaze, and some there were in place, That would haue sworne, that she had ben the very same she was, Saue that they knew that she was buried long agoe. But most of all the other guestes, that Nicoluccio, The husband of the Dame, this louely Lady eyde: And when Gentile did by chaunce and fortune steppe aside, As one that had desire to question with the Dame, No longer able to withhold: demaunded whence she came, Where she a stranger were, or els in Bologne borne: The Lady knowing who it was, should she not bene forsworne, Would to her husband tolde and opened all the case: But to discharge her promise made, she helde her peace, with face As modest as she mighte. Some other asked, where That little pretie boy was hers which she at breast did beare? And other did demaund, where she were ought allyde, Or were Gentiles daughter deare? she not a word replide. With that the feaster came, your iewell sir (quoth some That sate at borde) is passing faire. but is too seeming dombe. What? is she so in deede? whereto Gentile said: It yeeldes no slender token of her vertue that she staid And helde her tong as now. Declare (quoth they) to vs What Dame she is, to which request Gentile answearde thus. I will with all my heart declare the truth (quoth he) If you, vntill the whole discourse be told, will promise me, Not once to moue a foote, but euery one to keepe His place: whereto they all agreed, and gan to sweare by deepe And very solemne othes to complishe his request. The table being taken vp, the keeper of the feast Sate by the Ladies side, and thus began to tell: This woman, is the seruant true, that serude her master well, Of whom I spake right now, when I your iudgements craude This is the seruaunt ilbeloude, that when she had behaude Hir selfe in eache respect as fitted such a one, Was shaken off, and turnd to grasse, in streetes to make her moane: Whom I, to pitie moude, did succour as I might, And by my care and handie helpe, from present death did quight: And mightie God, that sawe the great good heart I bare, Restord her from that loathsome corse vnto this bewtie rare. But to the ende you may more plainely vnderstand How these aduentures me befell: I purpose out of hand In short discourse to shewe and open all the case. Then gan he to vnfold his loue, and how he sude for grace Unto this worthy dame, whose bewtie pearst his brest: And passed so, from point to point, vnripping all the rest, Distinctly from the first: which made the hearers muse, To listen to this long discourse of strange and wondrous newes. And hauing tolde the whole as I before haue pende, Both how he loude, and how she died, thus closde he vp the ende. Wherefore (my Lordes) quoth he, vnlesse you haue of late Ychangd your thoughts &amp; minds anew since you at table sate: And chiefly you, (and points to Nicoluccio) she Whom here you view, of right is mine, and only due too me. No lawfull tittle may, or rightfull clayme be layde To chalenge her from me againe, was no man there that sayde A woorde, but all were still to heare those matters paste, And for desire to learne the rest, and what he meant at laste. Good Nicaluccio, and all the rest beside That present were, and eake the dame no longer could abide, But out they burst in teares, and wept for pities sake. With that Gentile standing vp, the little babe did take, And bare betwixt his armes, and led the Ladie eke By one hand to her husband warde, and thus began to speake. Stand by (good Gossup mine) I doe not heere restore To you your wife, whom both her Friends and yours refusd before, And as an outcast scornd: but frankly giue this dame My Gossup, and her little childe that of her bodie came, To thee, for this of troth I know, the babe is thine, Begot by thee, I christened it, it beares this name of mine, And is Gentile calde: and my request shall bee, That through three months, this Ladie hath been soiornesse with me, Thou wilt no lesse esteeme of her, or worse good will Bestow on her, than though shee had with thee continued still. And by that selfe same God which forced me to beare Such loue, as by that loue to saue her life, to thee I sweare, That, neither with her friends, nor with thy parents, shee, No, not with thee her spouse, she coulde in greater suretie be As touching honest life, than with my mother deare: Assure thy selfe, shee neuer was abusde, nor tempted heere. This processe being tolde, Gentile turnde him rounde Unto the Ladie (dame quoth he) you know, I had you bounde By faith and lawfull oath: I quit you heere of all, And set you free aboorde againe, and goe againe you shall To Nicoluccio, and with that both wife and brat To Nicoluccios handes he gaue, and downe Gentile sate. The husbande did receiue his wife with willing hande, And eke the babe: and how much more he in dispayre did stande Of hauing her againe, whom hee accounted dead: The greater was his ioy and mirth when he so happily sped. In recompence whereof, he yeelded to the Knight Gentile, for his great good turne, the greatest thankes he might. And all the rest beside, that were to pitie moude, Gentiles nature did commend: hee dearely was beloude Of all that heard the case, and feasted there that day. Thus will I leaue the matron, and her sonne at home to stay. These matters ended thus, ech guest his horse did take, And parted from Gentiles house, that did the banket make. Home rode the man and wife vnto their grange with speede, The cheare which was at her returne, and welcome, did exceede. The people maruailde much, that shee who buried was, Could liue againe, and euer as shee through the streetes should passe, In Bolyne men did gaze, and greatly view the dame. And from that day Gentile still a faithfull friend became To Nicoluccio, and the parents of his wife, Whom hee by vertue of his loue had raisde from death to life. Lenuoy. Vnbrideled youth is prickt to pleasure aye, And led by lust to follow fansies fyts: Unskilfull heads runne retchlesse on their way, Like wylfull coltes that broken haue their bits: Not lookyng backe, till foultring foote doe faile, And all consumde that was for their auaile. Unhappy they, by scathe that purchase skyll, And learne too late how youth dyd lead awrie: Unluckie men for wit that follow wyll, And foule delights in golden prime apply: More wisedome were ech one to wed a wife, Than marryed dames to lure to lewder life. For though that nature let vs runne at large, And all things made by kynde to common vse: Yet man must lende an eare to ciuill charge, That points a baine for euery foule abuse: And bids (beware pollute no marriage bed) Without offence let single life be leed. As honest loue by custome is allowde, (Both law and reason yeelding to the same In single wyghts) so parties being vowde To marryage yoke assaulted are with shame: Both God and man such sluttysh sutes detest, The lawfull loue is euen counted best. Which makes me blame Gentiles rash assault, On Catilina fayre, from former vowe Whom he pursude to charge with heauie fault, And sought to sinne to make this matron bowe: Yet grace at last preuailde in both so well, As shee stayd chaste, and he to vertue fell. His foule desire his lewde and lustfull mynde, Was cause of lyfe, and wrought a double pleasure: This beried dame in pit to death had pynde, Had he not laude, and likt her out of measure, Thus ill sometime is cause of good successe, And wicked meanings turne to happines. Had some rash ympe beene in Gentiles case, So farre inflamde wyth Beautie of a dame, And after that had had so fyt a place To worke his will, and done a deed of shame, I doubt mee much, hee would haue reapt the frute, By leaue of force of all hys paynefull sute. Here all were blest; the mother well reuiude, The infant borne, the matron full of ruth: Thrice happy he for being so truly wiude, Gentile worthie praise for loyall truth. All louers may hereby example take, And learne of him blind fansies to forsake. [Two Knightes did linke in League of great goodwill] The argument to the fourth Historie. Two Knightes did linke in League of great goodwill, At length the one corrupts the others wife, And traitourlike procurde her vnto ill, Which vile abuse bred deadlie hate and strife, And was the cause this leacher lost his life. For why, the Knight to whome this wrong was wrought This tratour slue, when he full little thought. The murther done, he gaue his Cooke the hearte Of him that had conspirde this filthie feate, And made him dresse it curiouslie by arte, And gaue his wife the same at night to eate, VVho fed thereof, and thought it passing meate: But when she knew, the heart, the hap, and all, She loathde to liue, and slue her selfe by fall Quid non cogit amor? VVhilome in Prouance were, as they that knew the same Doe make report, two Courtly knightes, both men of worthie fame: Ech knight his Castle had, well furnisht euery way, With store of seruants at a becke their pleasures to obey. The tone Rossilion calde, a bold vndaunted knight, The second, egall to the first, sir Guardastano hight: Who being men at armes, and passing well approude For valiant courage in the fielde, like faithfull brothers loude, They dayly vsde to ride to Turneies both yfeare, To tilt, to iust, and other feates perfourmde with sworde and speare. Their garments eke agree, and were of egall sise: To shew the concorde of their mindes vnto the lookers eys. And thus though either knight his seuerall maner held, And either ten myles at the least from others Castle dwelde: Yet hapneth it at last that Guardastano fell In liking wyth Rossylions wife, and loude her verie well. A dame of beautie braue, renowmed very much, Whose featurde face and goodly grace the knight so neere did touch: As hee reiected quight the faith he should haue borne Her husband, and his trustie friend that was his brother sworne. Hee vsde his gestures so vnto this gallant dame At sundrie times, that she as length his friend in loue, became, And liked well the knight and so began to place Her fansie, as shee nought so much did tender or imbrace As Guardastanos loue: Shee euer lookt when he Would frame his humble sute, and craue her secrete friende to be. Which fortunde in a while: for he bewraide his case, And she lesse wise than wanton, streight did yeeld the Louer grace. There neaded slender force, so weake a fort to winne, For she as willing was to yeelde, as he to enter in, And thus for twice or thrice, the lustie louers delte In Venus sport, whose frying hartes with Cupids coles did melte. But in this loue of theirs, they did not vse so well. The matter, but the husband did the smoke by fortune smell. Of that their filthy flame: who highly did disdaine That such outrage and soule abuse his honour should distaine, Whereby his former loue to mortall hate did growe, And then he purposde with himselfe to slay his deadly foe That fowlie so abusde a Knight that gaue him trust. Meane while came tidings that in France the Lystes were made The Trump proclaymde the tilte Rossilion out of hande. To Guardastano Castle sent to let him vnderstand The newes: and eake withall did will his man to say, That if he would the morrow next vouchsafe to come away Unto his house, they would conclude vpon the case Full friendly Guardastano did the messenger imbrace And told him that he would (if God did lende him life) The morrow night come ouer, to Rossilyon and his wife, Which auswere when the knight receiued had he thought The tune approcht, wherein to slay the traytor knight, that wrought Such falsehoode to his friend I leaue you for to scanne The thousand thoughts, the broken sleeps and fancies of the man, That such a murther meant, and ekes the knightes desire Who thought it long before he came in place to quench his fire When morning came the knight well armed from foote to crest Tooke horse, and had a friend or two whom he did fancie best, Well mounted on their steades: they had not ryd a myle, Before they came vnto a wood, a place to worke their wile. There lay he close in wayte within the cops, whereas Full well he wist that Guardastan of very force must passe. There hauing staide awhile, a farre he might discry The Knight unarmde, with others two that rode unarmed by, As one that feard no fraude, nor any force at all, When that Rossilyon did perceiue him iust against the stall Where he on horsebacke sate full ready for the chase, A vallie fit to worke his feate: with grimme and gastly face He sets his spurres to horse and put his launce in rest, And gallopt after, crying loude, thou knight and trayterous gest, Now be thou sure to die, in penance of thy fast: And with the word, bestrake him through the shieuered launce it crackt Against the broken bones, and thorough pearst his corse. Unable Guardastano then for to resist the force, Or once to speake a word, fell downe vpon the blowe, And presently gaue vp the ghost, the speare had spoyld him so. With that his friends amazed, and very much in doubt What this should mean, stood still a space, at last they turnd about Their nagges, and sparde no spurres, vnto the Castle ward Of Guardastano, whence they came, feare made them gallop hard. When thus Rossilion sawe his foe bereft of life, He left the saddle, and withall drewe out a shoulder knife, And ript me vp the brest of him that murdred lay: Which done, with egre hands he pluckt the trembling heart away, Wherein the treason lodgde: and hauing there by chance Or els of purpose, (skilles not which) the pendant of his launce, He wrapt it vp therein, and willd his man to looke Unto the carriage of the same: the heart his seruant tooke. Then hauing straightly chargd, that none should dare to say A word of that which they had seene and he had done that day: He mounted on his horse, and in the euening rode Unto his Castle backe againe, and there the knight abode. His wife that hard him say, that Guardastano came That night to suppe with him at home, and looked for the same, Did wonder at his stay: and being one dismayde, How hapt that Guardistano commes not now (good syr) she saide. To whom the knight replyde, he sent me word right now He could not come to day, good fayth his let I doe allows. The Lady wofull woxe, and lowring gan to looke, Rossilyon lighted from his horse sent one to call the Cooke: Who being come in place, take here (quoth he) this heart. I slue a Bore of late by hap, herein bestow your arte. Do make some daintie dishe, according to your skill, And serue it vp in siluer plate: dispatch you know my will. The cooke receiude the heart. and made a cunning messe Of meate thereof, as men are wont that curious cates can dresse. He minst it very small, not sparing any cost, For why, the knight his maister, did alow him with the most. When time of eating came, Rossilyon sate him downe, And eake the Lady, who for lacke of Guardastan did frowne. The meate was brought to borde, than he that ganne to thinke Upon his murther lately done, could neither eate nor drinke. At length the cooke sent vp that other messe of meate, But he, as one that had no liste, did will his wife to eate, And set the dayntie dishe for her to feede vpon. The Lady, somewhat hungrie, fell vnto the cates anon. And felt it very sweete, which made her feede the more, She rid the dishe, and thought it had bene of a sauage Bore. Rossilyon, when he sawe her stomacke was so good, And that the meate was all consumde, the dishes emptie stoode: How thinke you wife (quoth he) how like you of your meate? Good sir (quoth she) I like it well, I had good liste to eate. No wonder (quoth the knight) by God, although this cheare Do wel content thee being dead, in life thou thoughtst it deare. The Lady hearing this, stoode still, as one dismayde. Upon the wordes, when pause was past, vnto the knight the sayde, Why? what is that (good sir) which you haue giuen me To sup withall? who answerde thus: I doe protest to thee, The foode whereof thou fedst, was Guardastanos heart, Whome thou didst so entierly loue, and playdst the harlots part. Be bold it is the same, this knife his belly ripe, And from the rootes with these my hands, the traytors heart I stript, And crackt the strings in twayne to ease my heart of woe That could not rest contented, but by murthring such a foe. The Lady, when she heard that Guardastan was slayne Whom she had loude, to aske where she lamented, were in vayne, Coniecture of her cares, imagine her distresse. At last (quoth she) thou cruell knight, (I can not tearme thee lesse) Hast playd a wicked part, and done a cursed acte, In slaying of a guiltesse man, (O bloudy beastly fact) A wight that woed not me, twas I that earned death, If any did deserue at all the losse of vitall breath Twas I that did the deed, I loude, I doe protest, And did of worldlie men, account that worthie knight the best. How might he death deserue who loyall was to thee? But (mightie Gods) it is your will, and pleasure now I see, That these so noble cates, the heart of such a wight. In chiualrie that did excell, a passing courteous Knight As Guardastano was, shoulde be my latter meale, And that I should with baser meates no more hereafter deale. Wherefore (good faith) quoth she, I doe not loath my foode, And therewithall vppon her legges the louing Lady stoode Before a windowe, that was full behinde her feete, And sodainly from thence she fell into the open streete. Which deede no sooner done, the window was so hie, But out of hand, her breath was stopt, and so the dame did die With carkasse all to crusht, by reason of the fall. The knight her husband seeyng this, (who was the cause of all) Stoode like a man amazde. and then misliked sore Both of the Ladies losse, and eke the murthred knight before. And being then adrad, and standing in a doubt Of Counte Prouince, and the rest that bordred thereabout: He sadled vp his horse, and roade in post away: The night did fauour his intent. As soone as it was day. Twas all the countrey through that such a dame was dead, And presently vpon the fact the knight him selfe was fled. Then they that seruants were of eyther castle, came With bitter teares, and tooke the dead, the knight, and eake the dame, And in the castle Church, in marble hewde for twaine, They buried both the murthered knight, and eke the Ladie slaine. With verses on the graue, to shew both who they were, And what was cause that Guardastan and she were buried there. The Lenuoy. The Poet that to Loue did pen the path, And taught the trade Cupidos ympes to traine, Within his second booke aduised hath, That who so lookes, and would be willing same, To keepe his loue vnto himselfe, he must Neither brother, friend, nor yet companion trust. And hereupon his grounded reason growes, That ech man seekes to serue himselfe in chiefe: And he to sight that friendliest countenance showes. Yet for his flesh will soonest play the theefe. As stolne Deare in taste exceedes the gift, So gallantst gaine is that which commes by shyft. In greatest trust, the greatest treason lyes, Where least we feare, there harme we soonest finde, An open foe each man full quickly flyes, Hee woundeth most that strikes his blowe behinde: But little hurt the open Adder workes, The Snake stings sore, that in the couert lurkes. The barking Hound hath seldome hap to bite, His mouth bewrayes his meaning by his crie: No berde vpon the open twigs doth light, The naked Net ech foolish foule doth flye: The hidden hooke is hee that doth the feate, Of sugred bane the wiliest mouse will eate. Who feares no fraude, wyth ease you may beguyle, The simple minde will soone be ouergone: He takes least harme that doubtes deceyt and wile, And dreading thornes, doth let the Rose alone: The Trumpets sound bewrayes the Foe at hand, And warning giues his furie to withstand. The glewing grome that fyghts before he commes, Is eyther voyded, or by sleight subdued; The way to wynne, is not to beate the drummes, For threatning throates are easily eschued: The surest meane to worke anothers woe, Is fayre to speake and be a fryend in showe. Had not this knight reposde assured trust, Upon his fryend, that loude him as his life, Could he so well haue serude his fylthie lust? Or leysure had so to abusde his wife? No, had he thought such treason hyd in breast, He would haue lookte more nearely to hys guest. But louing well, and meaning not amisse, He lowde him scope, without suspect of ill To come and goe, to vse the house as hys, A perfect shewe of very great good wyll: Both purse and plate, both lands, and lyfe, and all, (Saue wife alone) lay pledge at euery call. Which makes his fault, and foule offence the more, That dyd this deede and wrought this trechery, Against his friend that loude him euermore, And thought him void of vice of lechery: Good nature deemd that Guardastan could not, For fleshly lust so deare a friend forgot. But see, how synne once feasting on the minde Doth muffle man and leades him quight away: It makes him passe beyond the boundes of kynde, And swerue the trade where truth and vertues lay, Refusing friendes, reiecting lawes, and right, For greedy care to compasse foule delyght. And as the man herein deserueth shame, For stoupyng so to base and beastly vice, So are those dames exceedingly too blame. Whose glaueryng glee to lewdnesse doth entice: Who frame their lookes, their gesture tongs and tale, To serue their turne in steede of pleasant stale, Two sorts I fynde deseruing trust aleeke, The mounting minds that sue for hygh estate, And such againe as sensuall pleasures seeke, And hunt the haunt of euery louyng mate: Both which to come by what they like and loue, Renounce theyr friends, and scorne the Gods aboue. But marke yet well the sause that doth ensue, Such stolne flesh, is bytter as the gall, Great are the plagues to such disorders due, From skyes reuenge and fearefull scourge doth fall: The dome diuine although it suffer long. Yet strikes at last, and surely wreakes the wrong. For Helens rage king Menelaus wife, The Stories tell how Priam and his towne Confounded were, and how for broyle and strife In wrongfull cause, the walles were battered downe: Full many a knyght in battayle spent his blood, And all because the quarrell was not good. So when this Traitor knight had fed his fyll, Upon Rossilions wyfe, and wrongde his friende, By foule abuse: in guerdon of his ill, The wrathfull Gods brought him to wretched end To quit hys glee, and all his former sport, He dyed the death in most vnhappie sort. And shee, who falst her faith and marriage heste, And double penance for her pleasure past, For fyrst she eate his heart she fansied best, And desperately did kill her selfe at last. Note here the fruites of treason and of lust: Forbeare the like, for God is euer iust: Nihil proditore tutum. Amore, Puo piu che ogni amicitia, et che ogni honore. [The Lumbard Albyon conquered Cunimund] The Argument to the fift Historie. The Lumbard Albyon conquered Cunimund, And after death of him inioyd the state, And married with the Ladie Rosamund, The Princes daughter whom he slue so late: Whose skull he did conuert into a pot, Because his conquest should not be forgot. His custome was at euerie feast hee made, To drinke therein for pompe and foolish pride, And on a time his Queene he gan perswade To doe the like: whereto she nought replide But so much scornd his offer of disdaine, As straight she drew a plot to haue him slaine. A noble man that Don Ermigio hight, With on Parradio by the Queenes deceate, Were wrought to kill this monster if they might, And by the sworde they meant to doe the feate: And so they did within little while, VVhen least the king mistrusted anie guile, Vpon his death, Ermigio out of hand, Espousde the ladie Rosamand to his wife, Which when longums chaunst to vnderstand He practisde with the Queene to reaue his life, To thend that he might marrie with his dame, Who gaue consent to do this deade of shame. With venim vile to worke she thought it best Which when Ermigio dranke, and found the drift, By force he draue the Queene to drinke the rest Who seeing that there was none other shift The payson supt, and took it patientlie. As iust rewarde for both their villanie. Parradio eke whose helping hand did further The Lumbards haue, and brought him to his death For guerdon due to him, to quit the murther, First lost his eies, and after that his breath That men might see, how trulie God doth And plague offences, lightlie with the like. Among those warlike wights That earst from Almaine came, And other northly parts besides Those men that beare the Of Lombards chunst to light In Italy and there Two hundred yeeres and somewhat more. The only rule did beare Throughout that realme which we Now Lombardie do call: Untill such time as Charles the Great Had dispossest them all, And draue them theuce by force. And meane of knightly might? What time (I say) it was their lot In Italy to light. One Alboine was their chiefe, A man of monstrous wit, And valiant in the feate of armes For martiall practise sit. This Alboin ere his came To Italy, had slain King Cunimundus and bereft Hina of his princely raigne. And not content with death Nor hauing belly full Of noble blood, cut off his head And of the clouen skull Did make a quaffing cup Wherein he tooke delight To bouse at boorde, in token of His pompe, and former fight. This Cunimundus had A daughter passing faire, Rosmunda hight, that was his ioy, And should haue bene his heire, If he had kept his crowne, And not bene conquered so: But being slayne, his daughter was A captiue to his foe, This Captaine kept her thrall, And ment it all her life: Till loue at last this Lumbard forst To take her to his wife. When marriage day was past, And he to battell fell, And conquering of Italie He loude his wife so well, As she might neuer parte: But like a warlike dame, She euer logde in open campe, Where so her husband came: Who sundrie cities tooke, And conquerde many a towne, By force of sworde, and Lyonlike Went ramping vp and downe. Untill at length he came To Pauoy, where of olde, (As in the chiefest place of all) The kings their courte did holde. When full three yeeres and more, This Lumbarde there had layne: Unto Verona he remoude, With all his princely trayne. And presently preparde A solemne banket there, To feast his frendes, and others that Of his retinue were. Amids which princely cheere And royall feast, the king, Did will the wayter on his cup, That he to boorde should bring The mazare that was made Of Cunimundus head: And hauing it in presence there, (Where he with wyne were sped, Or else by malice moude, I wote neare what to thinke) But hauing it in place, he gaue His Queene the cuppe to drinke. The cuppe her fathers skull, O wilfull witlesse acte, Which no man well aduisde would do, But one that were distracte. The Queene perceiuing this In mockage to be ment Of Alboyne, as it was in deede, And sawe his lewde entent, And how he skofte the king Her father in the same, Was stuft with raging rancour streight, And blusht for verie shame. In sorte that all hir loue Which she had borne before Unto her husbande, grewe to hate, She loathde him tenne times more Than euer she had loude Or fansied any wight: And thereupon resolude to doe A mischiefe, if she might, And to reuenge by death Of Alboyne, monstrous man, Her father Cunimundus bloud, Loe here the broyle began. For Rosmonde all in rage, Consulted with a peere, Ermigio calde, a courtly wighte, This noble man to steere To murther of the Prince, I leaue her wordes vnpende, This noble hearing whereunto Her long discourse did tende, Declarde the Queene his mynde, And vttred his conceite, And said Parradio was the man That must dispatche the feate: Without whose helpe (quoth he) I wote neare what to say: I thinke him such a one as dares Such ventrous parts to play. Your grace were best to proue, If he consent, you shall Not fayle of me, but stande assurde To haue me at a call. Forthwith the Queene did cause Parradio to appeare: Who after sundrie offers made, And wordes of courtly cheare, To moue him to the spoyle Of Alboyn, thus replyde: In vayne your grace doth goe aboute To haue the king destroyde By these my giltlesse handes, That day shall neuer be, I truste, the world shall neuer proue So foule a fact by me, As to procure the death And murther of the king: Of treason vile, to haue a thought To practise such a thing. Leaue off your lewde entente, Or seeke some other wight To worke your feate, I neuer yet In slaughter tooke delight. The Ladie hearing this, Hnd hauing earnest zeale To worke her will, reiecting shame, Bethought her howe to deale. There did at selfe same time, Upon the Queene awayte, A proper wenche, of comely grace, Full fitte to make a bayte To take such louing woormes And hang them on the hooke, Whose greatest pleasure is vpon, A courtly dame to looke, This gallant likte her glee. Her gesture, and her face, And by deuice did hape at last To purchace priuie grace. Meane whyle the subtile Queene That found this louers haunt, And knew he daily plyde her mayde, Thereby to make her graunte And yelde him his desire, Thus thought it best to worke, In selfe same place where they did meete, In secrete sorte to lurke, As though it were the wenche With whome he would debate, And so perhaps she might both checke And giue the foole a mate. Which hapned so in deede: For on a certaine day, The Queene to compasse this her crafte, Put on her maydes aray, And in the wonted place, Where they did vse to talke, Bestowde her self. When night was come Forth gan this gallant walke, And to the standing came Where lay this lodged doe, Whome he had thought to be the mayde, But it was nothing so. Streight he in wonted wyse, As custome was of yore, Pronounste his painted termes of loue, And flattred more and more, Bewraying all his thoughtes, And ripping vp his harte Unto the wenche (for so he deemde) And playde the Louers parte. Ten thousande wordes he spake, And tending all to loue: Whome after all his long discourse, The Queene did thus reproue. Parradio doest thou knowe With whome thou standest here? Who thus replyde in louing wyse: Yea that I doe (my deare) And namde the selfe same mayde, Who was his friende in deede, With whom he had conferrde of loue, In great good hope to speede. What sir? you are beguilde, I am not she you weene: No seruing mayde assure thy selfe, I am (quoth she) a Queene. And Rosmond is my name, Nowe doe I knowe thy minde, And priuie am to all thy guyle, Thou shalt be sure to fynde Of me a mortall foe: Nowe make thy choyce of twayne, Where thou wilt spoyle y? king my spouse Or thou thy selfe be slayne, For this outrage of thine, Which thou hast done to me: Leaue off delayes, dispatche with speede, It may none other be. Parradio hearing this, And pondring in his thought To howe extreme a poynt by wyle Of Rosmond he was brought: Resolude to slay the Prince, And ridde him of his lyfe: And for the better working of His feate, did vse the wyfe The diuelish Queenes deuise, And Don Armigios ayde. And in this sorte these wicked folkes The cruel pageant playde: The king, as custome was, Because the day was hotte, To take a nappe at after noone, Into his chamber gotte. Where being softely layde, The place was voyded strayte, And eurie groome had leaue to parte That vsually did wayte. To yelde the king his ease, Thus dealte the suttle dame. And to be sure to haue her will, She shifted thence with shame Her sleepie husbandes sworde, Who then in slumber lay, For that he should by no deuise Haue powre to scape away, This done, the cruel wightes (Of whome I spake before) With bloudie mindes, and armed hands Approched to the doore: And vp they thrust the same, And softly entred in: And stole vpon the heauie prince, That slumbring long had byn. Yet wrought it not so well, For all their theeuish pace, But that king perceiude them when They came vnto the place: Who mazed in his midde, And chargde with sodaine feare, To see these two suspected wights To prease in presence there: Gate him vp with Lions rage, From Cabbin where he slept, And to his sworde, for safegarde of His life and honour, leapt. But out, alas, the Queene Had reft the weapon thence, Which earst the Prince was wont to vse. And weare for his defence. The Ruffians that in rage For blood and mischiefe sought. Bestowde their blowes vpon the kyng. That no such practise thought: And so bestirde themselues His weapons being bad, As in a while they slue him there, And so their purpose had, Unwist of any wight, The murther was vnseene, And knowne of none, but of the two, And of the cursed Queene, When this deuise was wrought, Ermigio out of hande Did seyze vpon the Pallace, with Intent to rule the land. And thought to wed the Queene, And so he did indeede: Whereto the Queene and all the rest, That fauourde her, agreede. Imagine of their ioyes, Whom filthie sinne did linke, What pleasure they in kingdome tooke, I leaue for you to thinke. But sure in my conceite, Where murther brings the wife, There wealth is woe, lust turnes to loath, And liking growes to strife, But turne I to my tale, That plainly may appeare, What hap befell, and whether they Did buie their marriage deare: The Lumbards priuie that Their king was fouly slaine, And that by meane thereof they might Their purpose not attaine: But should bee forst to flee, Or worser hap to haue By longer stay, their chiefest goods And iewels for to saue, Trusst vp in fardell wise, And so conueide by stealth The Ladie Aluisenda thence, (And eke good store of wealth.) Who daughter to the king, But lately murthred was, Not by this wife, but by the first: Away the Lumbards passe, Unto Rauenna, where As God and fortune woulde, Longinus tho Lieuetenant to Tyberius, courte did holde: Great Constantine his sonne, Whose Empire stretched wide, And vnder whom Longinus had In trust those Realmes to guide. This Captaine entertainde Them in good louing wise And did the greatest friendship vse, That he mought well deuise. It fortunde so at last, (The cause I vote not well) Longinus to good liking of The Ladie Rosmonde fell, Whose fansie grew so great Unto the featurde wight, As marrie out of hand he would To further his delight. To bring this match about, He practisde with the dame, And gaue aduise that she shoulde take In hand a deede of shame. The murther of the man That vsde her as his wife: There was no choyce, but shee must reaue Ermigio of his life. The Queene that cleane had cast The feare of God away, And awe of men, not weying what The world of her might say: And thirsting for estate, Whereto she hoapte to clime: Preparde a poysoned drinke for him Against his bathing time, And made in wise, she gaue A holesome Gossups cup. Which he should finde exceeding good, If he would drinke it vp. Who hauing no distrust Of wife, or diuelish drift, With willing hands vnto his mouth The poysoned pot did lift: And drank a greedie draught His former heat to quell: It was not long before the drinke Unto his working fell: Which when he felt to rage And boyle within his breast, And knew himselfe vnto the death With venim vile possest. He drew his desperate sworde, In choler and despite, And draue the Queene to quaffe the rest, And empt the vessell quite. Which done, at one selfe time, Both he and eke his Queene, Did end their liues, that hastners of King Albyons bane had beene One poysoned syrrupe slue, This cursed couple tho, Whose beastly liues deserude so vile A death for lyuing so. Which when Longinus heard, And how that matters went: The Ladie Aluisinda streight Unto Tyberius sent, And all her treasure eke That earst her fathers was. Withall, Parradio who did ayde To bring these feates to passe. Who being there in place, In cruell sort was slaine, And ere he dyde, was reft his eyes, To put him more to paine. Nullum peccatum impunitum. Ogni peccato a morte a'l fin lhuom mena. The Lenuoy. Lo heere the fatall end of murther done, Such blooddie factes deserue no better hyre: Behold the threede that of such wooll is spon, Marke well their lot that mischiefe doe conspire, It lightlie doth vpon their heads retire: And those that are the workers of the deed, Though long forborne, at last no better speed. See, to reuenge when Rosmond once began, Incenst there to by wrath and deepe disdaine, She could not stint by murther of a man, Nor leaue, although she saw her husbande slaine, But thought she woulde attempt the like againe: Her vile conceite was blinded all with blood, She could not turne about to see the good. Sowst once in sinne, and washt in waues of ill She vanisht ruth, and pitie flong aside, Yelding hey selie to spoyle the slaughter still, Whom she misukte, should streight haue surelie dide. Such flames of wreake withyn her bowels fride: And being cald to hie and princelie state, In foule attempts, she could not want a mate. Worth whyle to note how such as beare the sway, And sit in seat of royall dignitie, The righteous Gods without respect, doe pay, And plague them for their hellish crueltie, With losse of honour liues and iolitie: And such as are their ministers in ill. Either gallowes eates, or fatall sworde doth kill. Crude'lta sta spesso in donna bella. [The king of Thunise had a daughter faire] The Argument to the sixt Historie. The king of Thunise had a daughter faire, Whose beauties brute through many countries ran. This Lady was her fathers only heire, Which made her loude and likt of eury man, But most of all the king of Granate than, Began to loue, who for he was a king, By little sute, this match to cloth did bring. The promise past betweene these noble states The rested nought, but onlie her conuey In safetie home, for feare of rouing mates, Who would perhaps assault them by the way: Wherefore the king Cicils pledge they pray, Who gaue his word and Gantlet from his hand, Not to be vext by any of his land. Away they went, the ships forsooke the shore, And helde their couse to Granate warde amain, When sodeinly Gerbino (who before Had lovde the Queen, &amp; did his match disdain) VVith Galies came this royall prize to gaine: The fight was fierce, a cruell battaile grewe, But he at length most likelie to subdue. VVhen Sarizens saw the force of blooddie foe, And that they must surrender vp the dame, Maugre their might, &amp; needs their charge forgo: VVhat for despite, and vvhat for verie shame, And partly to discharge themselues of blame, They kild the Queene, Gerbino looking on, And threvve her out, for fish to feed vpon. To venge vvhich deede, and cursed cruell acte, He slue them all, not leauing one aliue, VVith fire and svvord the Sarizens he sackt, For that they durst so stoutlie vvith him striue And did his loue of life and light depriue. Yet backe againe to Cicill Ile retyrde, Missing the marke vvhich he had long desyrde. VVh? nevves vvas brought vnto the aged king The Grandsire, hovv his nephevv vvilfullie Had broke the league, and done a heinous thing, Committing spoile, and shamefull Piracie: Although he loude Gerbino tenderlie, Yet did adiudge him to the death, because He did prefer his lust before the lavves. King William, by report of such As dwelt within his lande, Who second Prince of Cecil, held The Scepter in his hand Two babes begot vpon his Queene, A male, that Ruggier hight: And eke a daughter, Custance cald, A Dame of beautie bright. This Ruggier, whilst his father liude, By fortune had a Sonne, Gerbino namde, of whom this tale Especially doth runne. Who by his Grandsyre nourisht vp And nurtred from a boye, At length became a proper man, And was the Princes ioye. His courteous nature wonne renowne, His valiant courage knowne Not only in Cicilia was: But brute abroad had blowne The fame thereof to foraine realmes. His praise doth passe the boundes Of all the Ile, where he was bred, And in Barbaria soundes: Who to the King of Cycill payde Their tribute money then: Which great renowne of Gerbins name Unto the eares of men Was brought that euery one extolde His vertues to the skye: Who but Gerbino all abrode, Whose fame like his did flie? Among the rest that heard reporte Of Gerbin, was a dame, The daughter of the king of Tunise (I wotte not well her name) But as (the men that sawe her vaunte) Shee was the fairest hewde, And trimmest shapte, that euer kinde Had cast or creature vewde Whose body was no brauer deckte With louely limmes without Th? was her mynd with maners fraught And vertues round about. This Lady hearing noble men Oft reasoning of renowne That Gerbin wanne, by worthy deedes, And how his fame did drowne That chiualry of all the rest: And that his courage was So great as he in manly feates All other knightes did passe, Delighted very much therein, Shee likte the talke so well, And stood so long deuising of His prowesse, that shee fell To like Gerbino, though vnseene: She felt her brest to frie With fancies flame, and was of him Enamord by and by. So that it did her good at harte To heare of Gerbines fame, And eke her selfe among the rest To publish out the same. As willing as shee was before To heare of others talke, So glad this Lady woxe at last. To haue her toung to walke. The playnest proofe of great good will That lurking lyes in brest: For when the minde doth like, the mouth Can neuer be at rest. And on the other side, as fast This peerlesse Princesse fame Was noysde abroad, and so in fine To Cicill Ile it came: There was hir beautie bruted much, As other where beside: So long till Gerbin through reporte Of his fayre Lady fride. And felt himselfe enlaste in loue, And tangled in the net: That willie Cupid earst to take His louing Lady set. This heate did daily grow to more Within the gallantes brest, And did torment him so within, That he to purchase rest, Deuisde an honest lawfull skuse To parte from Cicill Ile, And gat him leaue to trauaile vnto Tunise for a while, Upon desire to see the dame, Whose fansie bound him thrall: And gaue in charge vnto his frende, And folkes he went withall, As much as euer lay in them To further his intent, As euery one should thinke it best: And tell her what was ment Of Gerbines parte, and how he loude, Enduring bitter payne For her, and from the noble Queene To bring him newes againe. Of whom, these men that had the wit To handle matters well, Went Merchant like vnto the court, Fine iewels there to sell: Which they of purpose brought from home And Ladies vse to bye, As rings, and stones, and carkenettes, To make them please the eye. And by this practise in they gotte Within the Pallace gate, And made their shew, and march?tlike In euery pointe they sate, To spye a time to moue their sute Unto the noble Dame: Who, in a whyle that they had bene In place, by fortune came, And twharted where Cicylians sate, Upon desire to see Such iewels as might like her best, Now here began the glee: For one that had a fyled tong, And durst his tale to tell And looke a Ladie in the face, Unto his purpose fell. And after reuerence done, began To say in sobre sorte, That Gerbin willd him to repaire Unto her fathers courte, To see, and to salute her grace, Whom he did tender more Than all the Ladies on the earth, That he had seene before. Her loue had pierst his noble brest, And cleft his manly harte: And he was well contented with The stroke of Cupides darte. Both he, and all the wealth he had Was hers to vse at will, Requesting her to take in worth Gerbinos great good will: I can not pen the tale he tolde, So well in euery place, As he, perhaps, pronounst it then: The gesture giues the grace. But this you may assure your selfe, He dealte so orderly, As needed: for the Princesse did Receiue him thankfully: And did accept his message well, With answere to the same, That as Gerbino burnt in loue, So shee did frie in flame, And felte as hot a coale as hee Within her tender brest: If inward loue, by secret ache, And griping might be gest. And to thend her former talke Unfayned might appeare, Shee sent Gerbino such a ring, As shee did holde most deare. A iewell of no slender price, The value did excell: This message being borne him backe Did like the Louer well, The token highly was esteemd, No richesse mought haue pleasde His fansie halfe so well, as that, For why? his smarte was easde. And after that, he sundrie tymes Sent freindly lynes of loue, And tokens to the Princesse, by The man that first did moue The sute, and brake the matter vp: Deuising how he might, And ment him selfe to talke with her, If fortune fell aright. But matters being at this hande, And luckely begonne: Deferring off from day to daye The thing that should bene done: Whilst Gerbin melted with desire His Lady to imbrace: And she againe did long asmuch To see her louers face. It so befell, the king of Tunise His daughter spowsed had Unto the Prince of Granate, which Did make the Lady sad. She woxe the wofulst dame aliue, For being matched so: It did not only grieue her, that Shee was compeld to go So farre away from Gerbin: but The thing that nipte her nere, Was, that she feard she neuer should Haue seene her louer deare, Once being parted from the place In all her life againe: And hereupon she willing was, And would bene very fayne To scape the Ring her fathers handes, And liude with Gerbin aye: She beate her braynes, deuising meanes By stealth to runne away Likewise y? knight was cloyd with care, And liude a wofull man. Her mariage knowen, his valiant brest To throbbe and ake began: Was neuer wight in greater woe, Nor angry moode than he: At length when care was somewhat past, He thought his helpe to be, And only ayde to rest in force, Wherefore he did entend By strength of hand to win his loue, When so the king should send Her home vnto her husbandes realme: Loue had possest him so. As, he the Princesse to enioye. Through fire and floudes would goe. The king of Tunise hauing heard Some inckling of good will, That was betwixt the knight and her, And doubting of some ill That Gerbin would pretend: besides, Well knowing that he was A valiant wight and one that did Full manly prowesse passe: When time was come to send the queene Unto her husbands land, By letters which he sent, hee let King William vnderstand His meaning and his full inteent, And did request beside, To haue assurance at his hands, That he would so prouide, That not a man within his Realme Should hinder his pretence, Nor Gerbin make resistance, when He sent his Ladie thence. The hoarie graue Cicilian king, That loden was with age, And wist not of his daughters loue, Nor yet Gerbinos rage, Nor deeming that the kings demaunde Did tend to such effect, Did frankly yeld his sute, as one That did no ill suspect. And for assurance of the same, To rid the prince of feare, He sent his Gantlet, for a pledge That things confirmed were. Who hauing such asssurance made, Let builde a mightie barke In Carthage Hauen and did rig The same with earnst carke. And finely finisht vp the ship. In minde, without delay. Unto Granata, by the Seas, To send the Queene away. He wanted nothing saue the time To complish his intent: Meane while the wanton Princes, that Knew her father ment, And smelling out his purpose, causde Her man in poast to goe, Unto Palermo couertly, To let Gerbino knowe, Both of the Ladies late contract. And that by ship shee must Within a while to Granat goe, To serue her husbands lust. Wherefore tell Gerbine if he bee The man in deed (quoth shee) And such a valiant Knight at armes As he hath bragd to mee, And often boastes of himselfe Or beare me halfe the loue, He made in wise: he knowes my minde, I shall his courage proue. The messenger that had the charge Did as the Queene had wild: And made returne to Tunise, when He had her hest fulfild. When Gerbin had receiude the newes, Both of her going thence, And also that his Gransire gaue His gloue for their defence That should conuey the Princesse home Unto her husbands land: He doubtfull woxe, and wist not what Was best to take in hand. But waying well the Ladies wordes Whom he did most imbrace: To make a proofe of faithfull loue In such a doubtfull case, Unto Messina streight he went, And there two Gallies made: And armde them well with valiant men, And skilde in Rouers trade. And to Sardinia did conuey Him selfe, and all his route: Entending there to make his stay, And linger thereabout, Till time the Queen by shipping came Which was within a space: For why Gerbino had not long Continude in the place. But that he might perceiue aloofe One vnder saile that came, And had but slender gale: he knew It streight to be the same Wherin the Queene his mistresse went: The Gods would haue it so, For at that instant slender was The winde that there did blow. Then (quoth Gerbino to his mates) If you be valiant men, (As I haue thought you all to bee, And doe account you:) then There is not one among you all I dare auowe, but earst Hath been in loue, or presently With Cupids shaft is pierst: And certainely withouten loue Within the breast of man, No goodnesse growes, as I doe deeme Nor any vertue can. And if you loue, or euer did, Then lightly may you gesse The great desire, and burning loue That doth my heart oppresse. I doe confesse I am in loue, And Cupid causer was That I procurde you hither now, To bring my will to passe, And vndertake this present toyle. The yonder ship you see, And in the ship doth rest a dame, The only ioy of mee. And eke besides my Ladie deare Whom I would haue so faine, Great wealth there is, to quit your toiles, An easie thing to gaine. Small fight (no doubt) will serue the turne, If you will play the men: Which bootie, if wee may atchieue, (My mates) assure you then I only will the Ladie gaine, That is my only care: As for the goods, I am content Among your selues to share. Wherefore (my friends) attempt the fight, Let courage neuer faile: The Gods you see are willing, that We should the ship assaile. You see she hath no gale to goe, She can not passe away? Fight freely, all the spoyle is yours, You shall be made to day, There needed not so many wordes Their willing hearts to win: For why encountring rather than Their liues they would haue bin The bootie bred the great desire, They thought his tale too long: The greedie lust of pray did pricke Those lustie Lads along. Wherefore as soone as he had told His tale, the trumpets blewe: And euery man his weapon caught, And to the oares they flewe, And to the shipwarde on they went, With all the speede they might: The men aboord that see them come Preparde them selues to fight. For why they could not scape away, The Gallies were so neare, And eke the winde so slender was To cause the ship to steare. When Gerbin did approch the barke, He wild the chiefest men, That were the guides, and rulde the ship, To come aboord him then, Unlesse they ment to fight it out, The Sarizens that saw Both who they were, &amp; what they would, Said that they brake the law Which earst the Prince of Cicill made Unto their Soueraigne, and To make the matter plaine, they shewde The Gantlet of his hand: Loe here King Williams Gloue (quoth they) Behold it here in sight: This is your Pasport, nought yee get, Unlesse it be by fight. Gerbino halting earst descride The beautie of the dame Aloft the Poope, began to frie And melt with greater flame Than euer he had done before: For then her feature seemde, Farre fresher than in all his life The lustie louer deemde. And thereupon inraged thus By beautie of the Queene: He gaue his scoffing answere, when He had the Gantlet seene: Good faith (quoth hee) I neede no gloue, My Faulcon is away: I haue no vse to put it to: But if without delay You doe not yeeld the Ladie vp, Prepare your selues to sword: For sure, vnlesse I haue my will, You shall bee layde aboord. And presentle vpon the same Without a farther talke, The arrowes flewe, from side to side, The bullot stones did walke: A cruell fight began to grow On eyther part a space: But when Gerbino saw at length His force could take no place, He lades a Lyter all with fire, And with his gallies went Full closely to the mightie ship. They seeyng his intent, And knowing this, of verie force That they must yeeld, or die: Did make no more adoe, but causde The Princes by and by, (That vnder hatches sobbing sate Gerbinos only loue) To leaue her teares, and shew her selfe Upon the decke aboue. Who, as vpon the foreship stoode In presence of them all, The hellish houndes, the Sarizens, Unto the Knight did call, And ful before his face, they fliee, With many a blooddie blow The Ladie, crying out for grace: And hauing done, did throw Her carued carkasse from the ship Into the brackishe flood: And to Gerbino therewithall Exclaymde, and cryed a good: Loe, take sir Knight, we yeeld her vp Unto thy crauing and handes, In sort as lyes in vs to doe, And as the broken bandes Which thou hast (wretchlesse man) despisde, Deserue: now doe thy best. Gerbino, hauing viewde the deed, And wayed within his breast The tygres harts, and bloudy mindes Of those that slue the dame, Did make no more adoe, but close With dreadlesse courage came A boord the ship, and there begon Without respect of grace, Full Lion like, that lackes his pray, When bullockes are in place: To doe those wicked slaues to death, He did not fauour one. Some rent he with his eger teeth, He set his nayles vpon Some other, breaking all their bones, To glut his hungry hart, That longd for vengeance of the fact. Then gan he play his part, With sharpe and cruell sword in hand, As one without remorse: He seard me one, and scotcht an other, And mangled euery corse. Meanwhile the flame began to grow, And kindle all about The bloudy barke, and bodies slayne, The sparkes began to spout. The knight to saue the taken spoyle, Did cause his water men, To beare away such bootie as Serue their purpose then. Which done, he left the burning ship, And to his gallies goes, With wofull conquest of the Mores That were his mortall foes. Then willd he all the Ladies limmes That in the water were, To be vptaken, peece by peece, Not one to tarry there. Which bones he long bewept with teares, That in abundant wise, For very griefe distilled were By lymbeckes of his eyes. And after many dolefull plaintes, And profes of louers paine, Returning home vnto the Isle Of Cicille againe, He causde her body to be tumbd In Ustica, an yle Full sore against Traponus soyle. And then within a whyle, He hyed him to his natiue home, A man of heauie hart, Meanewhile the king of Tunise, that Had tiding of the part That late was playde, attyred all In blacke, his legates sent To Cicill, to the king to shew His grace, how matters went, And all the order of the fact, And let him vnderstand How that his nephew broken had By rash attempt, the band. Whereof king William wrothfull wox, And seeing that he must Of force, or shew himselfe a Prince, Or not be counted iust: He made Gerbino to be tant, And kept in yron gyues. His nobles could not change his minde, And purpose, for their liues. He iudged his nephew to the death, And loosing of his lyfe: There past not many dayes, but that Gerbino felt the knife, And did eudure his grandsires wrath, Who rather wisht to see, His nephew murthred, than him selfe A faithlesse King to be. And thus these two vnhappy wights Without the fruites of loue Had shamefull deathes, as you haue heard By this discourse aboue. Lenuoy. VVho works against his soueraigne Princes word, And standes not of the penaltie in awe, Well worthy is to feele the wrathfull sword, And dye the death appointed by the law: No fauour is to such offendours due, That, eare they did amisse, the mischiefe knew. For Princes willes are euer to be wayde, The statutes are the strength and stay of all, When lawes are made, they ought to be obayde, What royall Peeres, by pledge, or promise shall At any time confirme to friend or foe, Must stable stand, the law of armes is so. For they are second Gods in earth belowe, Assignde to rule and strike the onely stroke, Their crownes and scepters, be of perfect shew, That all estates are vnderneath the yoke: What they shall say, or doe in any case, By dutie ought to take effect and place, Wherefore who dares aduenture vp so hie And proudly presse to alter kings decres, Not fearing what may light on them thereby, Nor forcing what they shall by folly leese: Of law deserue the hardest point to byde, For scorning those whom God appoyntes to gyde. When royal Rome dyd flourish in estate, In auncient age, the Senate bearing sway, The lawes were so seuere, as who forgate To liue vpright, and doe as they did say: Was presently committed to the blocke. Without respect to blood, or noble stocke, Some in exile were sent to foreine landes, Leauing their wyues, and little babes behinde, Some sonnes were slayne euen by the fathers handes, Who fauouring right, forgot the lawe of kinde: Iustice in Rome bore then so great a sway, As no man durst good orders disobay. We reade of one, a ruler graue and wyse, Who made a law, and that to this effect, That he should be bereft of both his eyes, Whom any of adultery might detect: And bring good profe that it was so in deede, Upon which acte, the sages all agreed, It so befell, his sonne against the law Did first offend, that first deuisde the same, Which fortune when the wofull father sawe, And that his sonne could not auoyde the blame: For iustice sake did thus deuise to deale, To giue example in the common weale. Where as the law expressely willde, that he Who did offend, should be bereft his sight, The father with his sonne did so agree As each did loose an eye the faulte to quite. Wherein the father shewde himselfe seuere. And yet as ruthfull as the law could beare. O worthy wight, O ruler fit to raigne, That rather chose his childe to punish so, And eake himselfe to byde some part of payne. Than parcially to let offences goe: A double tumbe was due vnto his bones, For being iust and ruthfull both at once. King Romulus who let the citie builde, And founder was of all that royall race, That none should ouerleape his rampire wild, Which Remus did the fortresse to disgrace: Which when his brother saw in mockage ment, With wrathfull sworde he flue him ere he went. So here this aged Prince of Cicilie, When he had plegd and pawnd his honor downe, Though lesse offence to slay by crueltie, His nephew, than to stane his kingly crowne: For iustice is the chiefe and only thing That is requirde and lookte for in a king. Wherefore what Peeres and Princes and once haue wild, No subiect should endeuour to vndoe: For kings will looke to haue their hestes fulfild, And reason good that it should aye be so. As beastes obey the loftie Lyons looke, So meane estates must puysant Princes brooke. Ill fares the barke amid the broyling seas, Where euery swayne controlles the maisters skill, And each one stires at helme him selfe to please, And folowes not the cunning Pylots will: So realmes are rulde but badly, where the base Will checke the chiefe, that sit in highest place.

A merch?ts daughter loude her brothers boy That kept the shop, of linage basely borne, Which grome became the damsels only ioy, Whereat the brothers tooke no little scorne: That he who was a youth of no account, Presumde vnto their sisters bed to mount. So deepely sanke disdaine within their brest, As nought saue death their malice might assuage Those stately merchants mought not be at rest, Till time they had dispatcht the sillie page: Wherefore they all, with one consent agreed, To murther him, &amp; so they did in deede. Whose absence long did grieue the t?der maide That wept the dayes, &amp; spent the night in teares, Not knowing where he was, nor why he stayde: It so fell out in fine, the ghost appeares Amyd her dreame, of him that so was slaine, And bid her stint her teares, that were in vaine. He wried his wounds, he shewde the shameful blows He told the traytors treason, &amp; the traine That wroght his bane, &amp; wh?ce their malice rose And where his mangled carkasse they had laines Which proces tolde, he vanisht out of sight, The wench awoke, a heauie wofull wight. To trie the truth of what her vision spake, She got a mate of trust, and on she hide Vnto the place, a perfect view to take: VVhere after search, the body she espide, The body of her friend so lately dead, VVhose limmes she buried, bearing thence the head. VVhich head she plasht within a Basell pot, VVell couered all with harden soyle aloft, Her daily vse was to lament his lot, That so was slayne: she wept and sorrowed oft: So long, vntill her brothers stole away The Basell pot, wherein her louer lay. This second griefe compared to the furst, That she (poore wench) had suffred for hir friend, Increast her cares, and made her hart to burst, VVhose life did whole vpon the pot depend: The merchants, when they sawe their sister ded. For feare of lawe, in poste their countrey fled. Of yore within Messyna dwelt Three brothers, marchant men, Left wealthie by their fathers death, Who died by fortune then. This marchant had beside his sonnes, A daughter, very young, Elizabeth by name, in whom With beautie, nurture sprong. Which nymph, as nature furnisht had With seemely shape to view: So in her tender breast, a troupe Of honest maners grew. Which gifts of course are wont to cause Good liking, and good will But yet for all these vertues rare, This virgins lucke was ill, Or els her brothers cruell were: For she was ripe to wed. And yet without a married mate, Her lustie prime shee led, It fortunde so, at selfe same time This damsels brother had A yonker, that did keepe the shop, A very handsome lad. Lorenzo was the prentise name, To whom they gaue the charge Of shop and warehouse, all was his, To buie and sell at large. This ympe being verie neate and trim Of person, and of wit, And passing pleasure in deuise, A man for follie fit: By gesture and demeanure, set This damsels heart on fire, Who but Lorenzo with the wench? He was her chiefe desire. When thus the virgin livde in loue, This prentise did perceiue, By noting her from day to day, He then began to leaue His forraine haunt at game abroade, And only bent his breast To loue of her, of whom he saw Himselfe so sure possest. Thus lyking grew from lesse to more, The faggot equall was That burnt within these louers breasts, And brought the match to passe. For why there were not many dayes, Before the wench and he Gaue full assurance of good will, It might none other be. Ech felt the fruite of former gripes, Ech louer found such sweete In Venus ioyes, as sundrie times At pointed place they meete, And sport as the maner is Of wanton Cupids crue, That more respect the present toyes, Than troubles that ensue. And thus in play they spent the time, But loue giues such a flame, As few, or none, haue reason howe To quench, or hide the same. For why the light bewraies it selfe Unto the lookers flight. So farde it by these louers two, For on a certaine night As shee (good wench) was hasting to Lorenzo, where he lay: Her eldest brother chaunst to see And tract her on the way, And knew for certaine that she wene Unto the prentise bed: But like a wittie man be held His peace, and nothing sed. Although it was a death to him So foule a fact to knowe, Yet reason, and good nature do Perswade this marchant so. As after sundrie doubtfull thoughts That wandred in his hed, He was content to hold his tong, And so he went to bed. I leaue to descant of his dreames: But sure I scarce beleeue He slept at ease, who sawe a sight That so his heart did greeue. When morning came, &amp; stars did start, The man that saw the deed The night before, rose vp, and gate Him to the rest with speede And tolde his brothers what had hapt: And after long deuise, And counsell had vpon the case: Because their sisters vice Should purchase them no open shame, Nor yet their linage blot: They purposde so to deale in things As though they wist it not: Untill such time as fortune serude, Without mistrust or blame, To rid away the partie that Had doone them all the shame: Meane while they bore a merie face, And shew of friendly heart, To outward sight, vnto the man That plaide so vile a part. The better to reuenge the wrong. For that an open foe Is easie to be voyded, when His lookes his rancour shew. Which made them laugh in wonted wrie, With him that had defilde Their sister, till such time as they The leacher had begilde: Which hapned in a little space. For being in this glee, The brothers did deuise to take Their horse, and ride to see The countrie for a day or twaine: And as the Prouerbe goes, The moe the merrier is the feast. And thereupon it rose, They prayed Lorenzos companie For sport, and solace sake. Who though would gladlie stay at home, His wonted myrth to make With her that was his only ioy: Yet graunted his consent To goe abroade, suspecting no Such mischiefe as they meant: These merchants, and the prentise thus Their prauncing Ienates tooke, And brauely out of towne they rode In all the hast to looke A place wherein to doe the deede, I meane Lorenzos death. They had not iourneied farre, before They came vnto a Heath Besides the way a desert where No trauell was in vre. And being brothers there alone, They thought themselues as sure As needed, to dispatch a man, That no such force did feare. The short is thus, they made no wordes, But slue Lorenzo there. Mine author writes not of his wounds, But reason giues it so, That in reuenge of his abuse Ech brother had a blow: Whose body thus bereft of life, They buried in such sort, As no man saw the fact, nor none Could euer make report. The Prentise slaine, the carkasse laide In graue, the marchant men Unto Messyna whence they came, Returned backe agen. And to dissemble this their deede, They bruted all abrode, That lately in affayres of theirs The youth Lorenzo rode, And trauaild touching marchants gain: Which made the tale the more Of credite, for because he vsde To doe the like before. Elizabeth, at last, that saw The lingring of the man, And that he staid beyond his time, To languish sore began. And as the custome is of loue, To deeme ech houre a day, Ech day a yeere, ech yeere an age, When louers are away: So shee that thought his absence long, And livde in bitter paine, Did question with her brothers, of His comming home againe. Demaunding when the time was set, And when the day would be, That shee Lorenzo safe returnd, From forreine coast should see. To whom her brother thus replide, With countenance curst and grim, What doest thou meane to question thus? Hast thou to doe with him For whom thou doest demaund so oft? Good faith, vnlesse thou leaue These termes in time, thou shalt from vs An answere fit receaue And well agreeing to thy deedes. Which bitter gyrde did nip This silie maide, as she eftsoone Began to byte her lip. And woxe the wofulst wench aliue, Nor after durst to make The like demaund againe, for him That suffered for her sake: But spent the day in dolefull plaints, And sobde in secrete wise, The bitter torment of her breast Brast out and bathde her eyes, With sundrie showres of trickling teares Distilling by her face, She often cald him by his name, And wild him home a pace. Lamenting much his long delay, Whom shee did loue so well. Whilst thus the maiden stoode on termes, Upon a night it fell, That after manie hartie sighes, And sundrie cryes, For lacke of Lorenzo, slumber came And shut her aking eyes. Who was no sooner falne a sleepe, But dreames began to grow Within her raging retchlesse braine: Then seemd to open shew, Her murthred friend to stand in place, With vsage pale and wan, And cheekes with buffets blown out. The garments of the man Were all to rent, his robes were ragd: And, as the wench did gesse, Lorenzo in her dreame bespake Her thus. Thy deepe distresse (O faithfull friend) I well perceiue, I see my long delay Doth cause thy cryes: for my returne In grief thou pynste away: My absence is the cause of care, Thou doest accuse thy friend Of longring, and thy heauy playnts I see, can haue no end. Wherefore (I say,) dry vp thy teares, That flowe like floudes of rayne: Lament no more, I cannot come, Though I would nere so fayne. For why, the day thou sawste me last, Was ender of my life: Thy brothers, whilst I rode with them, Slewe me with sodaine knife. And therewithall he shewde the place Where dead his body lay: And willd her weepe for him no more, And vanisht so away. The wench awooke, and credite gaue Unto this dreame of hers, Which made her to bemoyst her face And bosome all with teares: Full bitterly shee did bewayle The murther of her loue. When morning came, &amp; Phebus beames The darknesse did remoue, Not daring to disclose the thing Unto her brothers, shee Did mynde to goe vnto the place, Of purpose there to see Where that her dreame wer true, or no, Which troubled her the night. And being that this Damsell was At libertie, and might For pleasure wander out, and home, In company of one A woman frend, that wonted was To walke with her alone, And priuy was of all her deedes: As rathe as she might rise, With mother nurse she gate her out, And to the heath shee hyes: Where by coniecture lay the coarse Of him that murthred was. As sone as they ariued there, She scrapt away the grasse, And sweepte the parched leaue aside: And where at first she founde The hardest soyle, and stoniest bancke, Began to delue the grounde: Shee had not digged any depthe, But lighted by and by, Upon her louers wofull corse, Unwasted that did lye And vncorrupted in the graue: Whereby the mayden knew That all the vision which she sawe The night before was true. Whereat shee waylde and wept a good, But knowing that the place Was farre vnfit for sighes and teares, Which could not right the case: Shee would haue gladly borne away The carkasse, to haue layde It in a decent tombe at home, Saue that shee wanted ayde. Wherefore she drew me out a knife, Wherewith away she swapte Her louers head, and vp the same In linnencloth shee lapte: And couered vp the corse agayne, And gaue the head to beare, Unto the nurse, her trustie frend, That was of purpose theare: Shee tuckt it in her apron close, (As women vse to doe) And so vnseene, from thence vnto Messina home they goe. Where being come, and entred to Her chamber with the head: Shee shut the doore, and on the same So long her teares did shed: Untill with bryne shee all besprent It, as it lay in place: And now and then among her cryes, Shee all bekist the face. Which done, shee tooke an earthen pot, Wherein she vsde to sette Her Basill, or her Parsely seede, The best that shee mought gette. Whereto in foldes of silken lawne She put Lorenzos skull, And after that, with garden soyle, She pourde the pitcher full: And strewde her finest Basill seede About alofte the same, From whence like Orenge water, smell, Or Damaske roses came. And daily after that, she sate Imbrasing of the Canne, And culling of it in her armes, As though it were the man, Whom she entirely loude before: And after kissing, then She would to teares, and sighing sobbes, From sighes, to teares agen. Continuing so, vntill such time As shee had watred all The Basill, with the dreary droppes, That from her face did fall: So that at length by tract of time, Or grossenesse of the ground, By reason of the rotting head, The Basill did abound, And gaue a passing pleasant smell. The wench did neuer leaue This folly, till the neighbours chanste Her practise to perceiue. Who, (when her brothers muzed that Her bewtie did decay, And that into her hollow browes The eyes were suncke away.) He spake then thus, we stand assurde, It is her daily gise, To goe into the garden, where The Basil pot it lyes: And there to weepe in wofull wise, A wretched wench to see: The brothers when they heard the tale, And hauing willd that shee Should leaue that fonde and foolish trade, But saw it booted not, Did make no more adoe, but hid Away the Basill potte Which, when she hapt to come againe, And not to finde it there, Full earnestly began to craue The same with many a teare: And being harde thereof, begon To wexe diseasde, and all Her sicknesse time, for nothing but The Basill potte did call, Her brothers not a little muzde To heare her strange request, In crauing of the potte, and ther- Upon did thinke it best To see the same, and make a search: Who hauing powred out The earth that was within the potte, Eftsoone espyde a cloute, And in the cloth, the head inwrapte, So freshe and fayre to vewe, As it to be Lorenzos head, By curled heare they knewe: Which set them in a sodaine dumpe, And made them greatly dread, The murther would be brought to light By reason of the head: And hereupon they hid the skull, And layde it in a graue, And from Messina went by stealth Them selues from death to saue: Entending, being fled the towne If they might passe vnspide, From thence, in poste, vpon the spurre, To Naples straight to ride. And thus I leaue the merchant men Their iourney forth to take, Who after sped, I wote nere howe: But thus an ende I make: The silly wench, amid her griefe Did neuer leaue to crye, To haue the Basill pot againe. But when shee did espie, That all her calling was in vayne, Her teares did neuer blin To issue from her cristall eyes, Till timy the harte within For very anguish, brast in twaine. Then Clotho came to rid The mourning Damsell of distresse, And brake her vitall thrid. Loe here the lotte of wicked loue, Behold the wretched end Of wilfull wightes, that wholy doe On Cupides lawes depend. Vn puoco dolce multo amaro appaga. Lenuoy. If all the earth were paper made to write. And all the Sea conuerted into incke, It would not serue to shew Cupidos might: No head can halfe his bloudy Conquests thinke: Unto his yoke he forceth euery wight, No one away dares for his lift to shrinke. Who most contends, the widest wound receaues, For Cupid then by force his freedome reaues. The sage who sayde, that (loue exceeded all) Pronounst the troth, and spake as we do fynde: He wist full well, that euery wight was thrall Unto the God that feadreth is and blinde: No Poet him, but Prophet may we call, For that of loue so derely he definde: For Cupid with a looke doth wound moe hearts, Then thousand speares, or thousand deadly dartes. Which Cæsar sawe, who sundrye Realmes subdude. Whereby his fame did reach the stately startes, For when that he fayre Cleopatra vewde, He fell to loue, for all his ciuill warres: In aged brest his youthfyll wounds renewde, Where Cupids scourge had left him sundry scarres. That learned Marcus, so renownde for wit, For Faustine fayre was rid with louing bit. Eake Annybal of Carthage manly wight, That past the Alpes to come to Italy, Whose puissance put the Romane hoast to flight: For all his force and prudent pollicy, Did stoupe to loue, surprisde with deape delight, Of one, a wench bred vp vnciuilly: And many moe, as fierce as he in feilde, Cupido forst with tender bowe to yeelde. And not alone this Archer masters man, But by this power, doth pierce the golden skies, And there subdues the greatest now and than: Such subtill driftes the Godhead doth deuise. As when that Ioue lovde Leda like a Swan, And prickt his plumes to please his Ladies eyes: Another time became a milke white Bull, And all to steale away a countrie Trull. Who hath not hearde how Phebus Daphne lovde? How mightie Mars was bound in Vulcans chaine? And eke how Ioue his greatest cunning provde, When he became a golden showre of rayne. Endymion he was passingly belovde Of Phebe, who with him had often laine: On Latinus hyll, the gastly God of hell, Pluto him selfe, did like Proserpine well. May Neptune boast or vaunt aboue the rest? Dyd he not loue as other Gods haue done? Hath Cupid neuer rasde his rockie breast? Could he for all his waues dame Venus shunne? No, he hath been, by pangs of loue opprest, The water nymphs his godhead oft haue wonne, No storme could stint, nor frosen flood remoue, Nor water wast his flames of burning loue. To banish him no wile, or wit auailes, No heart so hard, but melts as doth the waxe, To cure his wound all learned Phisicke failes, It burnes the breast, as fire consumes the flaxe: The fort of force must yeeld when loue assailes: Ech rebels mind with lingring siege he sacks. No towre so high no castle halfe so strong, But loue at last will lay it quite along. And looke who once is tangled in his net, And beares his badge fast fixed in his brest, By no deuise or gile away may get, But foorth he must, and march among the rest. By nature so the law of loue is set, As none hath will or power from him to wrest, No griefe so great, no toyle or trouble such, That faithfull louers thinke to be too much. No counsell giuen by friend, no feare of foe, No rulers rod, no dread of threatning law, No wracke of wealth, nor mischief that may grow, Can cause the wight that loues, to stand in awe: As flattly doth this former story show: Where you a wench so deepe in fansie saw As naught saue death might bring her woes to end, When she had lost her faitfull louing friend. Wherefore this wrong was great they did this maide: The brothers were a litle not too blame, That would the weneh from fixed fansie staid: And thought by force to quench her kindled flame. Loues heate is such, it skornes to be delaide. With greater ease you may a Tiger tame, Than win a wight whose liking once is set, Either to forgoe a friend, or to forget. Amor vince ogni cosa. [VVhen Aristotimus did strike the stroke] The Argument to the eight Historie. VVhen Aristotimus did strike the stroke, In Elyesus, and did weld the Mace As King alone, so heauie was his yoke, That subiects thought themselues in wofull cace: For greedie gulles that gapt for giltles blood, Were best esteemde, and most in fauour stood. Ech villaine vile that vaunted of his vice, Ech loathsome leacher longing for his lust, Was mounted vp, and held in hiest price, Sinne sate at bench, extortion counted iust, The best might bear no palme whilst he did rain, He banisht some, &amp; some with sword were slain. Till Gods at last detesting murthers done Incenst the hearts of sundrie noble wights, For due reu?ge, vnto his realm to ron, where matchte with suclie, as were his housholde knights VVith one consent this blooddy beast they slew, Amid the Church for Gods themselues to view. The woful Queen, the murthring m?ster wife, By fame assurde of dolefull husbands death, To flee the force, bereft her selfe of life, Enuying that her foes should stop her breath: Two Ladies eke, the daughters of the king Had leaue to die, who hung themselues in string. VVhat time the proude and puisant Prince Antigonus, in hande The Macedonian Scepter held And gouernd all the land: There livde one Aristotimus, A beast of blooddie kinde, That all to monstrous murther did Imploy his Tigres minde. Who, when by fauour and by force Of Antigon the King, The state of Elyesus to His yoke and becke did bring: Full tyrantlike he strake the stroke And hauing got the crowne, Gaue vp himselfe to loathsome lust, And brought the subiects downe, That earst in freedome long had livde. So mightie was his raigne, As to resist his cruell parts Men thought it all in vaine: What foul abuse was then vnwrought? What rigor left vntride? What wicked prancks &amp; pageants plaide Whilst he the realme did gide? His cankred nature all inclinde To slaughter and to blood, To kill the poore, and giltlesse soules, It did this monster good: And to this murthring minde of his, He ioynde the vile aduise, Of barbarous people, that to blood This tyrant did entise: The beastliest men that liuing were Alone he did not place In office, to controle the rest, (Which was a cursed case: That such vnciuill brutish beasts Should rule a Princes land) But choze them for his persons garde, To haue them neare at hand. Of all the vile vnkindlie partes That he aliue did play, I note but one aboue the rest, Wherein I minde to stay, To set this viper out to view: That all the world may see What plagues in store for cruell Kings By Gods reserued be: Who though to drinke in golden cup, And feast with daintie fare, And for a time abound in blisse, Yet end their liues in care. And steed of former sugred sops, They swallow bitter gall, And from the top of kingly throne Abide the shamefull fall. There dwelt within this tyrants realm A Citizen of fame, A man of wealth and great estate, Phylodimus by name: Who father was vnto a wench For feature that did passe, An A perse, among the rest, And nurtred well she was. Faire Micca was this maidens name, Whose beautie did excell. This Tyrant had a Souldier, who Did like the virgin well, One Luzio, a roysting Roague In fauour with the king, That to the end he might the maid Unto his bias bring, A messenger dispatcht vnto The father, straight to will Him yeeld his daughter to his hands, His pleasure to fulfill. He let him vnderstand his lust, The father seeing such A foule demaund, and shamefull sute, Was vexed very much, And gripte with anguish of the minde: But hauing wayde the case, And knowing that this ruffian stoode So in the princes grace: And highly was esteemde of him: Begonne to be afraide, And thereupon his wife and he Thought good to send the maide: Whom they perswaded as they might, For safetie of her life. To yeelde the Souldier vp the fort, Withouten farther strife. But shee (good heart) that lesse esteemde Her life, than spotlesse name, Well nurtred vp from tender youth, And aye, in feare of shame, Fell prostrate at her fathers foote, Upon her fainting knees, Imbracing him with bitter teares, The sutes she made were these: That he would neuer see her spoilde Of such a varlet vile, Nor let a cutthrote souldier so His daughter to defile: But rather let her die the death With fathers willing knife: Than yeeld her vp to Luzios lust, To leade a strumpets life. She was content with any lot, So she might scape his hands. Whilst hearing thus his daughters plaints The wofull father standes: And with the mother wayles the hap, And pities of the maide, Not knowing what to doe therein: The Leacher that had staide And lookt for Miccas comming long, Impacient of his flame And beastly heat, to fet the wench Himselfe in person came: Puft vp with deepe distaine and wrath, And fiild with enuious yre, That she did linger there so long, Whom he did so desire. Who beeing come vnto the house Where did this damsell dwell, And seeing her at fathers foote: For rage began to swell, And much misliking her delay, With fierce and frowning face, Controlde the wench, and bid her rise And follow him a pace: And must I Damsel come (quoth hee) Mought message not suffice? Doe way delayes, leaue of those teares, And wype your wantons eyes: Dipatch and come along with me, Doe linger on no more. Whereat the wench renude her plaints, As she had done before: And made no hast at all to ryse, But sate vpon her knees: Which Luzio seeing, all in rage Unto the mayden flees, And strips her naked as his nayle, And beate her round about, A thousand stripes he gaue the girle, That had not on a cloute To saue the burthen of a blowe From off her tender corse. But shee continde on her minde For all the villaynes force, Not weying all his blowes a beane, A mayde of manly harte: For though the beast had beate her sore Shee made no shewe of smarte: Nor yelded any sighing sobbes, In proofe of inward payne, But valiantly abid the scurge, And ready was againe To doe the like, more rather than To yelde to such a slaue, Or make him owner of the holde Which he did long to haue: The wofull parentes viewing this With griefe, and dewed eyes, Were greatly tho to pitie moude, And out they made their cryes: With sute of Luzio, there to leaue, And beate the mayde no more. But when they sawe they nought preuaild, Their aged lockes they tore, And out on God and man they call, Their daughter voyde of blame To succour, being sore distrest, Euen then at point of shame. Which sute, and yelling crye of theirs Did make the monster mad: And set him farther in a rage, That earts so plagued had The mayden Micca voyd of gilt. With that he drawes his knife. And in the aged fathers sight Bereaues the wench of life. Out gusht apace the purple blood From Miccas tender limmes, In such abundance, as about The place the mayden swimmes: A perfit proofe that all the zeale Which Luzio bore the wench, Did only growe of Leachers lust, Whom wrath so soone could quench. For had he grounded lust on loue, Or fanside Micca well, He would not so haue slaine a mayd, Whose bewtie did excell. Farewell to thee Dianas Nimphe, Thy vertue was so great, As well thou didst among the gods Deserue to haue a seate. For Lucrece could haue done no more, Than yeld her selfe to dye, And in defence of spotlesse fame A tyrants hand to trye. What kingly hart, what princely brest? Nay more, what manly mynde Could see, or suffer such a facte, Against the lawes of kynde? Would any man of womans milke, Endure so foule a deede, Not yelding him that playd the parte, A gibbot for his meed? And yet this butchers bloody rage, This tyrant could not moue To hate him ought the more, but eke The good that did reproue The filthy villayne for his vice, The Prince did make away. For some of them with cruell sworde He out of hand did slaye, And other some he forste abrode As banisht men to rome Eight hundreth at the least, into Aeolia fled from home, For succours sake, to saue their liues, And scape his hatefull hande, Who only sought the spoyle of such As dwelt within his lande: Where hauing certain months remaind These exile wightes did wryte In humble wise, by lowly sute That they such fauour might Obtaine from Aristotimus, As to enioy their wiues And silly babes, the only staffe And stay of all their lyues. But nought their letters moght auaile, He would not condiscend In any case, the Matrones to The banisht men to send: In hope by that to force them home And so to wreake his spite Upon those wise forecasting wightes That saude themselues by flight. But yet he causde a trumpe in fine To sound in market place, To shew that he was well content, And that it pleasde his grace, That wiues should seeke their husbands out: And gaue them leaue beside, With bagge, and baggage, babes and all, Without restrainte to ride. Hee licenst them, to iourney thence, And parte the citie quight, Which tidings made the Matrons glad, The newes did breed delight: The packts &amp; fardles then were made, The wagons were puruayde, Both carte and horses readie were, And women well apayde, That to their husb?ds they should passe When poynted day drewe on, The streets were stuft with cariage, wiues Were readie to be gone: Their little babes and all were there The porter only was The cause of stay, without whose leaue There might no carriage passe. Whilst they at gate thus wayting were A farre they might espye A trowpe of sweating Souldiers runne, That made a cruell crye: And willd the women there to stoppe, And thence agayne to goe Into the citie whence they came, The Princes will was so: Those hewsters draue the horses back, The streetes were somewhat straight, Which made the prease exceeding great, The iades were fully fraight With heauie burdens on their backes, Which so anoyde the way, As women might not well retyre, Nor there in safetie staye. But, by the meane of horse and men Such hurlie burlie grewe, That there the iades from off their backs The little infants threwe. The wofull sight that euer man Of honest harte might see, Such silly soules in such a throng Of cartes and coltes to bee: Who could not helpe them selues awhit Nor haue the mothers ayde, For they (good matrons) by this chaunce Were verie much dismayd. For as their glee was great before, And ioyfull eke the newes, To parte the towne: so this arest Did make them greatly muse. Ther might you see some babes braines About the chanell lie, Some broken legs, some broosed armes, And some with feare did crie. Were few but felt some part of paines, In such a retchles throng: And shee, that scaped best away, Was crusht, and curstlie wrong. When the Souldiers reckned had And taken full accompte Of wyues, and babes, &amp; knew the summe Whereto the whole did mounte: Unto the Pallace ward they draue Then like a flocke of sheepe, Which hired shepherdes on the hills For meate and wagies keepe. And beate the sillie soules a good, That seemd to slacke the way, Who, what for feare and faintnesse would Bene very glad to stay. When to the tyrants court they came, The monster by and by Bereft the matrons all their robes, Both wyues and babes to lye In pryson eke he gaue the charge: Thus were they foule beguild, Who thought (good dames) to seeke their men, From Countrie bounds exilde. Here will I leaue with heauy hartes, The wyues their woes to waile, Who hoping to depart the towne Were closely kept in gayle, And to the townes men will returne. Who, when they sawe the rage Their Prince was in, and wist not how His rancour to asswage, Amongst themselues deuisde at last One practise to approue, Whereby perhas they might haue hap The tyrants hart to moue. They had within the citie walles A sorte of sacred dames Whom sinne they thought it to abuse, I wote not well their names: Of Denys order all they were, Sixtene, or there aboute. The Citizens did deeme it good The Nunnes to furnish out With robes and reliques of the church: And in their hands to beare Their painted Gods, procession wise, As was the custome there: Well hoping by this subtill slight To moue the Prince his harte, Who though did murther men, they hope Yet had not layde aparte All feare and dread of sacred saintes, (As it fell out in deed) For when that euery virgin had Put on her holy weed, Alongst the towne they gan to goe, In very graue aray, With humble sute to stirre the Prince To pitie those that lay In prison, mothers with their bakes, Which was a wofull case. As then, by chaunce the Tyrant was Amid the market place. The Souldiers seeing dames deuoute So deckt with temple stuffe, For reuerence of their order, did Begin to stand aloofe, And gaue them leaue to prease vnto The Tyrant, where he was: Who hauing licence, through the midst Of all the gard did passe: And being somewhat neere the prince, The king began to stay, To know, both wh? the women came, And what they had to say. They told their tale, &amp; movde the sute, And opened their intent: Which when the Tyrant vnderstood, Perceiuing what they ment: Unto his traine he made a turne, With grim and gastly cheere, Controuling them, that did permit The Nunnes to come so neere. I lay the Tyrants taunts aside, I purpose not to put His kingly chafe within my verse: But Souldiers combes were cut. With that the gard began to grudge, And for the checke they had, With Holbards, which they held in hand, They laid about like mad, And bitterly did beate the dames, With many a clubbish blowe, Respect of reliques laid aside, The Souldiers raged so. Thus did they vse the sacred Nymphes That were to Denyse vowde: And to encrease their griefes the more, Ech virgin eke allowde Two talents for a recompence, Besides their hurts receivde: Thus of their purpose, both the dames, And Citie was deceyvde. At selfe same time, there liuing was A man of great renowme, When this outrage was put in vre. And dwelt within the towne: Ellanycus this noble hight, Then stricken well in age, Whose sonnes though Aristotimus Had murthred in his rage: Yet did mistrust him nought at all Because he was so olde, Was thought vnable ought to doe. Which made the tyrant bolde. This aged father waying well His sonnes and countries spoile, Determinde with himselfe to put The tyrant to the foyle, And take reuenge of blood, by blood, Of death, by murther done. Loe here I leaue the Prince a while His headlong race to runne. I must againe conuert my tale Unto those banisht wights, Whom sore it yrkt so long to lack Their wiues and sweet delights. For countrie loue by kinde doth worke In euery honest brest, And till we make returne againe We neuer liue at rest It was not long (I say) ere they, That to Aolia were By Aristotimus exilde, And forst to tary there, With ioynt consent of many moe, Tooke armes against the king: To bid him battaile out of hand Their Souldiers they did bring Within the tyrants countrie boundes, And did possesse the land That bordred on the citie which This monster held in hand. There making stout and strong defence Against the Princes powre, From whence they might with ease assail, And eke the foe deuoure. And to increase their might the more, All such as fled for feare From Elyesus, ioynde their bandes, And were vnited there: So that the whole assembled rout, Unto an armie grew: So many were those banisht men That from their countrie flew. Wherwith the Tyrant gan to quake, And tremble verie much, For why? this battaile that did grow, His state did greatly touch. The hammers beate within his brains, As on a smithes forge, He wist not how to void the foe, Or troubles to disgorge, That on his backe were like to light: At length he thus bethought, That hauing all their wiues and babes Who all the mischiefe wrought, In prison closely vnder key, He hopte he mought with ease, Deuise a meane the malice of His enemies to appease, Not by entreatie, but by force: For so his cankred minde Was bent to rigour: as of course It is the Tyrants kinde. Wherefore vpon a day he went Unto the prison, where The sillie captiue Ladies lay, With countnancefull of feare, With glowing eies, with bended browes And angrie Lions looke, Commanding those whose husbands earst Their natiue soyle forsooke, To write their letters out of hand, And speede a poast away With earnest sute vnto the men From farther force to stay, And do their wrathful weapons down: Thus wild he them to write. This was the summe that he would haue Those women to endite. Which of you do refuse (quoth he) To complish by and by, Be sure those eluish brattes of yours And puling babes shall die: And more than that, you (mothers) you Shall not be clere exempt Of torment, but the duly scurgde For penance of contempt. The women aunswerd not a word, Which chaft the tyrant sore: Who being thus to choller movde, Bid them delay no more, Nor trifle, but resolue vpon The matter out of hand, If not, they shoulde his princely power And pleasure vnderstand. The Ladies doubtfull what to say, Upon ech other gazde, As who would say, they feared not, But somewhat were amazde. There was by chance amongst the rest, One wife, a worthie dame Temoliont her husband hight, Megesten was her name, Who for the honour of her spouse, A man of good discent, And her good vertues, farre before Those other matrons went: One whom the rest did reuerence much And honor for her wit: This Ladie whilst the tyrant talkt, With sober grace did sit, And neuer movde her selfe a whit, But causde the others eke To doe the like: who when the Prince Had done his tale, gan speake, Not honoring the king at all, And thus the Ladie sed. O Aristotimus, hadst thou Had iudgement in thy hed, Or any wisedome in thy brest, Thou wouldst not thus entice Or goe about to make vs write Our letters of aduice Unto our husbands, teaching them How they should doe and deale, In case concerning good estate Of this our common weale. Farre fitter had it been for thee Us matrons to haue sent In message, vsing better termes To further thine intent, And better order in thy deedes Than thou hast done of late: I meane the time, when we were staide Euen at the castle gate At point to issue out of towne, Thou mockdst vs there in deede, Full greatly to thy taynte and shame. But now that things proceede Against thee as thou knowste no meane To scape the present doubt: If now (I say) by meane of vs In speech thou goe about Our husbands to begile, as vs In deedes thou hast before: I tell thee plaine, thou art deceivde, Thou scanste without thy score. That they be not entrapt againe, Wee women will beware: I would not wish thou shouldst surmise That we such Asses are Or sotted so, as seeking wayes To ayde and saue our selues From paine of prison, and to ease Our little apish elues, We would aduise our husbands to Despise their countrie wealth, Whose freedome dearer ought to be Than any wom?s health. The losse were light, though we decay, That babes and women be: And better were, our husbands should Us all in cofyn see Than they should vnreuenged goe, Or die, without the foyle Of him, that seekes to murther men, And worke his countrie spoyle. This Ladie would haue further gon And tolde the processe out, Saue that the Tyrant grew in rage, And gastly lookt about, Unable longer to endure The force of furious rage: Go firra, goe in poste and fetche (Quoth he vnto his page) This desperate dames vnhappie babe: And ere I parte this place, I will destroy and slay the sonne Before the mothers face. Whilste thus the Page in message sent Went seeking here and there Among the other boyes: this dame (A Ladie voyde of feare) Had spide anon her little impe: Come hither come (quoth she My prettie elfe, yet rather I My selfe will murther thee With friendly mothers forced hande, And reaue thy limmes of life, Than euer with thy bloud thou shalte Imbrewe a butchers knife. Which speach of hers so spitefull was, And nipt the King so nye, As he in furie farther sette, Did sweare the dame should die. And therewithall set hand to sworde To let the Ladie blood, That readie there to brooke his force Before his presence stood. And died doubtles there shee had And caught a sodaine clappe To set her packing, saue there was A friend of his by happe, One Cylo, whom he deerly loude, That held the Princes arme, And was the cause, by stay thereof, The Lady had no harme. This Cylo he was one of them Who ment to slay the king With helpe of good Ellanycus: They had deuisde the thing Long earst betwixt themselues: for why? They could no longer byde This cruell monsters bluddie hande, And stomacke stuft with pride. This sage appeasde the Princes wrath Who hauing throughly made A truce betwixt his rage and him, And causde him sheathe his blade: Perswaded that it yll became, And was a brutish thing, For him that was a noble peere, Yea such a puisant King, To bathe his blade in womans bloud: The conquest was vnfitte For such as in the like estate. And royall roome did sitte, Within a while that this was done, A marueilous happe befell To Aristotimus, that did This tyrants death foretell. For being with his Queene in bed In daliauce and delight, His seruants, going to their meate, An Egle sawe in sight, That made vnto the Pallacewarde, As fast as shee mought flie: This vggly Egle came amayne, And soaring in the skie Iust ouer gainst the very place, Somewhat beside the hall Where lay the Prince, from out her foote The foule a stone let fall, And presently vpon the deed Away apace did flie Quite out of sight, and as she went Shee gaue a cruell crye. Whereat the seruants meruelld much And made so great a dyn, As therewithall the king awoke That had in slumber byn. His seruants tolde him what they saw, And how the case did stande, He all in poast, vpon reporte Sent horsemen out of hand, For one that was a deepe deuine, In whom he did affye To shewe the case, to heare his minde, And what was ment thereby. The Prophet made him answere thus: O puisant Prince, (quoth he) Disgorge thy care, abandon feare, Let nothing trouble thee. Pluck vp thy manly harte: for Ioue Doth tender thine estate, And makes a speciall care of thee, The Egle that of late Thy seruants sawe, his herald is Whom he in message sent, To shew thee, that the mightie God Is very greatly bent To ayde thy force against thy foes, Who long with murthring knife, To spoyle theyr countrie of their king And reaue the Princes life. But boldly this presume, that God Himselfe will stand with thee, Gainst such as seeke thy death, and who Thy mortall enemies bee. The tale this cunning Calcar tolde, Did ease the tyrants brest Of diuers doubtes, wherewith he was By Egles meane opprest. Hee soundly slepte, no doubting death, Nor fearing ciuill sworde: But marke the end, and what it was To trust a Prophets worde. For hereupon the men that ment The murther of the king, (Ellanicus, and all his mates) Thought good to doe the thing Which they pretended out of hande, Not making longer stay. And so among themselues eft soone Concluded, on the day That followed next to worke the feate And bring their drifte to passe, And that selfe night, Ellanicus, As he in slumber was, Dreamte, that the elder of his sonnes Whom earst the tyrant slewe, Presented him before his face, With wordes that here ensue: Why sleepe, &amp; slugge you (father deare) Why doe you linger so? That you to morowe shall subdue Doe you as yet not know? And reaue this citie from the king Who now enioyes the same? Departe your pillow (father mine) And balke your bed for shame. Wherewith Ellanycus reliude, And hoping then in deede Of happie lucke, in breake of day Sought out his crewe with speede. That were confedered in the facte: Perswading them to caste All dread aparte, and flat to fall Unto their feate at laste. And at the selfe same time the king, (As hapte) a vision had, That fed him with assured hope, And made him passing glad. This dreame presented to his thought, That with a mightie trayne Craterus came, to take his parte, Resistance was in vayne. There was no cause why he should care But be of courage stoute, For that Craterus had beset Olympia rounde about. This vision vayne, of good successe Did so assure the king, As in the dawning timely hee Not dreading any thing Departes the Pallace, voyde of awe, With whom there only went That Cylo, which was one of those That all this mischief ment. By one and one his other men, Did followe somewhat slacke: Which when Ellanycus perceiude, How hee his trayne did lacke: The time it fitted finely then, The season seemed good, Unto this auncient foe of his, To let this tyrant blood, Without the giuing any signe, For so deuisde he had With such as were his fellow friendes: But being very glad, Up lifteth he his aged armes Unto the azurde skies, And with the lowdest voyce he could, Unto his mates he cryes: Why doe you loyter, (valiant laddes) And men of great renowne, To doe so worthy deede as this, Amid your noble towne? Which worde no soner spoken was, But Cylo first of all Set hand to sword, and drewe it out, And slewe me therewithall, First one of those that issued with The tyrant him to garde. Who so should take a tyrants parte, Deserues the like rewarde. Then after that, when Cylo thus The matter had begunne, Lampydio, and Trasybule With all their force did runne Upon the monster, fully bent Him out of hand to slay, Who then began to trust his legges: For why? he ran his way, To scape the danger of his death, And to the temple fled Of Iupiter the mightie God, In hope to saue his hed. But heathen gods mought nothing help His enemies were so hote, As him amid the sacred Church With shining swordes they smote, And there bereft him of his life, That well deserude to dye: And after dragde him blooddy thence In open streete to lye. There lay his loathsome carkasse slaine For euery man to vewe, The people did reioyce at harte For freedome gotte anewe. So glad were neuer hungrie houndes Pursuing of the hare, To fasten on the fearefull beast Each dogge to haue his share, As were the subiects eger then The tyrant to pursue, With hatefull blood of such a beast Their wepons to imbrew. Whilst thus the folkes debating stood Of matter hapt so late, Ech wife began to gaze about, And prie to finde her mate. For now the banisht men were come Unto the towne againe. To tell the mirth at meeting tho I thinke it were in vaine. For as their care was common earst, Whilst he the realme did gide, So semblant was their ioy no doubt, When such a monster dyde. This done, the people gan to preace Unto their Pallaceward, But ere they came, how matters went, The quaking Queene had hard, And of the slaughter of her King, Full heauie newes, God wot: Wherefore mistrusting what would hap, Eftsoone her selfe she got Into a priuie counting house, Where to escape their force, About a beame shee hung a sheete, And strangled so her corse. A dolefull case that any dame That was a Princes wife, Should for her husbands sake, be forst To rid herselfe of life. But yet of both, more happy she, Than was her husband slaine: For ventrously shee put her selfe To death, not dreading paine, But he the captiue, cowardlike To Ioue for succour ran, And tooke the temple, like a wretch, And dide not like a man. But turne we to our tale againe: The tyrant by this Queene Two daughters had, the fairest wights That lightly mought be seene, And ripe in yeeres to match with men: Who hauing heard report How that their father murthred was In such a cruell sort: In minde to void the furious foes (As virgins full of feare) Conuaide themselues into a vawte To stay in safetie there. But they that sought, so many were, And pryed so well about, As in the seller where they lay, They found the maidens out. Whom thence, without delay, they drew, And whet their eger knyues, As fully bent as men mought be, To reaue the Ladies liues. But there by hap Megesten was, Of whom we spake before, At whose entreatie, and the sute Of other matrones more, Those noble Nymphs wer tho forborn, For thus Megesten said To such as sought to doe the deede: In slaying of a maid You do the thing that Butchers hearts Would neuer vndertake, Good faith it were a shamefull fact So vile a spoile to make, As file your sisters with virgins blood, Against your manly kinde: Let greedie lust to be auengde Not make your eyes so blinde. But rather, if so be, there is No nay, but they must die, Giue leaue, at my request, that they Their proper strength may trie. Let them make choice vpon their death And scape your handie force. Whereto they all agreed in one, But no man tooke remoise. It irckt them that the tyrants blood Shouldst rest so long vnshed: There were appointed for the nones That both the Ladies led Into an inner lodging, where When they arriued were, The eldest sister like a Dame Undaunted, voyde of feare, From off her waste did loose the scarse That girt her loynes about, And bid her yonger sister doe The like with courage stout. Then to a refter of the house, Their girdles both were tide, The knots and all were fitly made To cause the silke to slide. Who so had viewde those virgins then He would haue thought, that they had not intended by and by Such break neck game to play. Their faces were so fresh to fight, Their eyes did neuer stare, Their tungs pronounst their tales as though Their hartes had felt no care, Their outward gesture shewde a ioy, More rather than distresse: When thus (I say) the knots were knit, To do the feate, the lesse Of both the Ladies tooke the elder Sister by the hand, Requesting her, that shee as then So much her friend would stand, As first to let her die the death, And play her part before: To whom the elder answered thus. As neuer heretofore I haue denyde thee (Sister) aughte In all my life: So now Euen at my death I am content Unto thy will to bow. Thou shalt haue leaue to let me liue Till thou be dead and gone: But that which greeues me most of all, And giues me cause of mone, Is, that I liue to see thy death before my losse of life: The yonger Ladie thereupon Without a farther strife Conuaid her head into the scarfe: The other standing there, Gaue counsell so to place the knot Iust vnderneath the eare, As lightly she might loose her breath, And rid her selfe of paine: The yonger followed her aduise, An easie death to gaine. A wofull thing for me to write, And loathsome eke to you (Deare Ladies) who to passe their time Shall hap my book to view: To thinke that two such virgins, borne And bred in Princely blisse, Should be inforst in fine, to make So hard a choyce as this. But (as the auncient Prouerbe goes) Perforce obaies no law: The crabbed carters whip will cause A stately steed to drawe. The yonger sister thus bereft Of life, the elder came And cut the girdle of the beame To hide her sisters shame, As well as shee (good Ladie) might. Then was her part to play: Who putting on that other scarfe About her necke, gan say Unto Megesten: noble Dame, When thou shalt see me ded: For honours sake vnto thy kinde See thou my carkasse led In place that is for maidens meete, Let not my body lie Despoyld of robes, to naked shew And view of euerie eye. And with her saying, downe shee slipte, And by her bodies pease, (Though light it were) did stop her pipes, And so shee dyde with ease. The Lenuoy. Those realmes right happy are, where princes rainge, That measure out by vertue all their deedes, Abhorring with their vassals blood to staine Their sacred hands, and gore their kingly weedes: The subiects there with willing harts obay, And Peeres be safe from fall and foule decay. But (out alas) where awfull Tyrants hold In haughtie cruell hands the royall powre, And mischiefe runnes by office vncontrolde, There aye the great the lesser sort deuoure: By daylie proofe ech one may daily see, That such as rulers are, such subiects be, Unlesse the law forbid the lewde to sinne, Unlesse the Prince by rigor vices quell, Disorders will by sufferance soone rush in: Who striues not then in mischiefe to excell? By nature man vnto the worst is bent If holesome statutes stay not his entent. A hungrie wight is hardly barde from food, The kindled straw is seldome when put out, A Tyrant that hath tasted once of blood, With much adoe forbeares the sillie rout: So sweete is sinne, as once from vertue fall, And thou art lightly lost for good and all, No looking backe, no bending foote about, No feare of fall for many a mischiefes past, No ill reuockt, no dread of any doubt, Till God by heapes powre downe his plagues at last: As by this verse, is plainly set to view, No matter fainde, but auncient storie true. Who would by might haue maintained Luzios lust, That slewe the childe before the fathers face? What King would wincke at matter so vniust? Or fauour Ruffian in so foule a case? The fact was vile, and dreadfull vengeance dewe Unto a Prince, that such disorder knewe. To bolster vice, in others is a blame, For such as may by power suppresse the deed: But crowned kings incurre the greatest shame When they themselues on Subiects flesh do feede: For Lions take no pleasure in the blood Of any beast vnlesse they bee withstood. And when such states so fouly doe offend, Not they alone doe bide the bitter scurge, But subiects are for rulers vices shend: As when the Sea doth yeeld to great a surge, The lesser brookes doe swell aboue their boundes, And ouerflow like floods, the lower grounds. Lyacon lewde, that fed on strangers blood, Although himselfe were he that God forgate, Yet caused was that loue with sodaine blood Drownde all the world, saue Pyrrha and her mate: Thus one ill yeere may worke ten thousands woe, God hates yll kings, and doth detest them so. As heere we see this vgly Tyrants wife, And giltlesse broode that neuer did offend, Raunsomde the fathers faultes by losse of life, And he him selfe was brought to wretched end: Wherefore let Peeres and states vprightly stand, Least they and theirs be toucht by Gods owne hande. For he that guydes the golden globe aloft, Bekoldes from hie, and markes the deedes of man, And hath reuenge for euery wicked thought, Though he forbeare through mercy now and than: He suffereth long, but sharpely payes at last, If we correct not our misdoings past. He spares no more the Monarke, than the Page, No more the Keysars than the countrie Clownes, He fauours not the auncient for their age, He cuts off Kings, for all their costly Crownes, No royall roabes, no scepter, no deuice, Can raunsome those that fauour fylthy vice. [Symona likt of Pasquine passing well] The Argument to the ninth Hystorie. Symona likt of Pasquine passing well, And he did frie as fast with egal flame, In sorte, as on a time these louers fell To make a match, of purpose for the same: With one consent where time and place was set, This louing couple in a garden met. There ech to other vttered their deuise, To salue the sores that fancy fixt in brest, They kist, they colld, thus neither part was nice, To take the time of both vvas compted best: Amid their glee, tvvas Pasquines hap to spie A bed of sage, that there vvas grovving by. Whereof he pluckt a leafe to rubbe his iawes, And presently fell dead vpon the deede: The vv?ch exclamde, whose soden crie did cause The neighbours by to come avvay vvith speede: The man vvas founde there senselesse as he lay, And she (poore vvench) as captiue borne avvay. The Crovvner sate, the iurie vvas in place, The vvitesse came for triall of the truth, The Iudge vvas there: vvho hearing all the case, And hauing of the silly mayden ruth, For pitie pausde, and to the garden vvent, To learne the troth, and scan of her intent. Symona straight vnto the border ranne, Where grew the Sage, &amp; pluckt a leafe or twaine, And therewithall to frote her gummes began, As one that would bene quit of murther faine: Lo thus (quoth she) my Lord, did he before, And thus was all, I sawe him doe no more. And with the word before the Iudge his face, The giltlesse maide fell groueling on the ground And there she died before them all in place, And then the cause of both their banes was found The tale ensues, which more at large doth tell, Both of their loues, and how their deathes befell. The fame of Florence is so great, That simple men do knowe The brute thereof by true report: Where dwelt not long agoe, A virgin fresh and fayre to viewe, A iolly lusty dame, As any was in all the towne, Symona was her name. Whose beautie though were very braue And kende had done as much For her, as she mought well request, Yet fortune seemde to grutche And malice at her featurd shape: For as the same did passe, Euen so her father of the meane, And basest order was. A man not hauing welth at will, The stately mistresse chaunce, Would not voutchsafe from lowe estate This miser to aduaunce. And hereupon the fathers want, With whom it went so harde, Of force constrainde the mayde to get Her liuing by the carde And wheele, and other like deuice, As selly maydens vse, With handy worke shee wonne her bread, She could none other chuse, Who though to earne her meat &amp; drink In spinning spent the day: Yet in this beggers brest of hers, A Lordlike hart there lay, That burst adventure to assay The force of Cupides flame: For by the iestures and the talke Of one that daily came Unto the house where she abode, A passing pleasant lad, One of her owne estate, for wealth, That of his mistresse had Both wool and yarne to spin and twist: The wench Symona fell In fancy with this merry Greeke, And lykt the weauer well. The virgin by his sweete regardes Was entred very farre, And masht within the net of loue: But yet she did not dare To further on that first attempt, She fryde with secret fyre, Of Pasquine (thus the youth was tearmd) Whom she did so desire. But euer as she twisted had A threed vpon the wheele, A thousand scalding sighes she fette: The silly wench did feele Them whotter farre than any flame Thus issuing from her brest: And euer as she went about, She thought vpon the guest That brought the wool, to haue it wrought, The spinning bredde the spight, The threedes did make her minde the man, When he was out of sight. And shall we deeme the weauer, whom The mayden loude so well, Quite voyde of wanton humors — no: For he to liking fell, And likewise eake as carefull woxe As was the louing trull, To see that thee did well dispatch And spinne his mistresse wooll. (As though the making of the cloth All wholly did depend And only of Symonas threed) Which made him not to sende, But often come him selfe, to see How she her wheele applyde: He neuer vsde to goe so ofte To any place beside. And thus the one, by making meanes, The other by desire She had to be thus sude vntoo, It hapt, he felt a fyre Unwonted, flaming in his brest: And she had shifted feare And shame aside, which still before Her chiefest iewels were. And hereupon they ioyntly fell Each other well to leeke, Both parties did so well agree, Small neede it was to seeke Which of them both should first assayle, Each fancyde other so, As by each others face, each friend, Each others heart did know. And thus from day to day it grewe, And still enkindled more, The flaming loue which she to him, And he Symona bore. Untill at length this Pasquine prayde The mayden earnestly, To worke such way and meanes to come Unto a garden by, Where he would tarrie her in place Untill such time she came, For that the garden was a plotte Conuenient for the same, And meerely voyde of all suspect: There might they talke their fill. Symona, like a gentle wench, Did graunt him her good will. One holyday at after noone, Her father to deceiue, Symona came with solemne sute, Requesting him of leaue To goe vnto saint Gallus Church, To fetch a pardon there. The selly aged syre agreed, Whose eye the mayd did bleare: For hereupon, another wench Lagina cald, and she Unto the garden went, where they Had poynted him to bee. But Pasquiue ere they came, was there, And brought with him a mate, Cald Stramba (Puccio was his name:) This Stramba he should prate And with Lagina chatte of loue, The matche was pointed thus: And whilst these two grosse louers did Their matters so diseisse, Unto the farther end of all The garden, Pasquine went, And with Symona there conferde As touching his entent. Heare leaue I (Ladies) both the talke Which Stramba did deuise Unto his late acquainted lasse, Presume his tale was wise, For as Cupido whets the tongue So doth he sharp the braine Of those that loue, and earnest are Their Ladies to attaine. And though perhaps this fellow wer Not come of gentle kinde, Yet being matcht with on he likt, Perhaps coulde tell his minde. For fansie makes the foolish wise, And compasse in his hed, By what deuice he may atchieue His liked Ladies bed. To Pasquine turne we now againe, Who (as I said) of late Was stept aside, of purpose with His minion to debate. There was, where he did sit, by chance Conferring of the case, A goodly bordered bed of sage, Euen full beside the place, Where as this louing couple coapt In secret sport and play: Who hauing long with merrie talke Consumde the time away, And made appointment eke to meete Another day againe, To banquet with Symona there To feele a farther vaine. This Pasquine to the sage resorts, Whereof a leafe he strips To rub his teeth and gummes withall, Hee put it twixt his lips, And so began to touch his teeth, And therewithall did say That Sage was very good to freat The filthie flesh away That stucke betwixt his hollow teeth. Within a while that he Had practisde thus vpon his gummes, His countnance gan to be Quite altred from the former forme, And after that a space That thus his visage swolne was Unto an vglie face, He lost the vse of both his eyes, And of his speech beside: And so at length in sodaine sort This louing weauer dide. Which when Symona had beheld, She watred straight her eyes, And (out alasse) to Stramba, and Lagina lowde she cries. The louers left the deep discourse, And to the place they runne, Where as so late this chaunce befell, And deadly deed was done. Ariuing there, and finding dead The weauer in the grasse, And more than this, perceiuing how His body swollen was: And seeing all his face bespangde With spots as black as cole, And that in all the body was Not any member whole: Then Stramba cried out aloude, Oh vile vnthriftie wench, what hast thou done? why hast thou giuen Thy friend a poysoned drench? What meanst thou by this deed of thine? Which words were spoke so hie, That all the neighbours heard the same That were the dwellers by. And in they pressed all in hast, Into the garden, where The showte was made, and being come They found the body there Both void of life, and fouly swolne, An vgly sight to see. And finding Stramba shedding teares, And blaming her to be The only cause of Pasquines death: The wench vnable eke For verie griefs of heart, a worde In her defence to speake: Though shee in deed were not the cause Yet they that came to view Did apprehend the girle, and thought That Strambas wordes were true. When thus the wench arested was, Shee wrong, and wept a pace: And so from thence, was brought before The common Iudge his face, Unto the pallace where hee dwelt. The maidens accusers were Exceeding earnest in the case, Both Stramba that was there With Pasquine as his faithfull friend, And other moe beside, That came into the garden, when The faithfull virgin cride. And hereupon the Iustice fell To question of the fact, Debating with the witnesses, Who hauing throughlie rackt The matter, and not finding her As giltie of the deede, Nor any proofe of malice that Might from the maide proceede, As touching murther of the man: Hee thought it good to stay His iudgement, and himselfe to goe Where dead the carkasse lay, To view the partie, and the place, To beate the matter out: For all the other euidence Might not remoue the doubt Within his head the Iudge conceivde In this so strange a case. The men that knew the garden, brought The Iustice to the place Where Pasquines carkasse puffed lay, And strouting in such wise, As made the Iudge himselfe amazde, Hee could not well deuise How such a mischiefe might bee done. Which made him aske the maide Symona, how the murther hapt. To whom the virgin said, Renowmed Iustice, after talke Betwixt this man and me, Hee stept aside vnto the bed Of Sage that here you see: And with a leafe thereof he rubd His gummes: as I do nowe, (And therewithall shee tooke a leafe To shew the Iustice how Her friend had done and this (quoth she) He did, and died than. Whereat this Stramba, and the rest That records were, began To scorne and laugh in presence of The Iudge, and earnestly Made sute that fire might bee fet, Wherein the wench to trie, To feele the penance of her fact, Which like a wicked wretch She had deuisde: shee earned death That would her friend dispatch. The virgin wofull for the death Of him that latelie died, And fearefull at the earnest sute Which Stramba made beside: Thus hauing rubd her tender iawes With Sage before them all, Without suspect of such mishap, Bereft of life, dis fall Unto the ground, where Pasquine lay, And in like sort did swell, From louely lookes, to loathsome limmes A monstrous chaunce to tell. And thus to shew the meane, how earst Her louer lost his breath, This sillie giltlesse wench her selfe Euen there did die the death. O happy soules, whose hap it was In one selfe day to laue So faithfully, and in selfe day The pangs of death to proue. And happier had you both ybin If you had had the grace, Some other where to spent the time, And not within that place. But farre more blessed are yee nowe, If in this death of yours, You loue ech other as in life Your likings did endure. But (thou Symona) happiest art, For ending so thy dayes: If we that liue may iudge aright, And yeeld the dead their praise. Whose innocent and giltlesse ghost Dame Fortune did denie By Strambas false surmised proofs Without iust cause to die. I count thee treble blest of God, For Fortune found (I say) A meane for thee by selfe same death, That rid thy friende away. To set thee free from misreports, And slaunder that did growe, And gaue thee leaue by losse of life, Unto thy loue to goe. The Iudge that saw this sodain chance And all others eke That present were, amazed stood, And wist not what to speake Or to coniecture in the cace, The wisest tongues were domme. At last, the Iudge as soone as hee Was to his senses comme, Thus said: by this it doth appeare The Sage that here you see, Infected is, and venim strong: Though Sage by nature be A very soueraigne holesome hearbe, The proofe hath made it plaine. But for because we will be sure It shall not hurt againe, Do delue it vp, and burne it here, It may offend no more. The Gardner therewithall was come, Who digd it vp before The Iudge, and all the standers by: He had not parde the ground Farre in, but that the cause of both Those louers banes he founde. For vnderneath this bed of Sage, The fellow that did dig, Turnd vp a toade, a loathsome sight, A worme exceeding big. The toade was of a monstrous growth: Then euery man could tell And iudge the cause of that mishap Which both those friends befell. Then could they say, the venomd worme Had bealchd his poyson out, And so infected both the roote, And all the bed about Where grewe the Sage, that bred their deaths: Then sawe they playne the cause And reason why the weauer dyde, By rubbing of his iawes. They made no more adoe, but forst The gardner by and by To make a fyre to burne the Sage, And eke the Toade to frie That was the cause of double spoyle. The Iudge had nought to say When this was done, but parted home, The people went their way. Straight Stramba, and his other mates That gaue in euidence Against Symona, brought a Beare, And bare the bodies thence So vgly swollen as they lay, Unto Saint Paules, and there Within one Tombe did burie both, For of that Church they were. Lenuoy. As noble mindes to loue are kindly bent, And haughty harts to fancie homage yeelde, As Cupid makes the stoutest states relent, And martiall men that daunt the foe in fielde: So meanest mates are masht within the net, That wily loue, to trappe his trayne hath set. What Prince so prowde, what King for al his crown: What sage so sadde, or solemne in his sawes, What wight so wise, but Cupid brings him downe, And makes him stoupe to nature and her lawes? Both poore and rich doe loue by course of kinde, The proofe whereof in all degrees we finde. That Hector sterne that stroue to mayntayne Troy, And slewe with sword full many a Greekish knight, For al the warres, yet loude Andromache, With her he slept, in her he tooke delight: His manly brest that force of foe withstoode, Was razde by loue, his Curage did no good. Vlisses flie, for all his wilie wit, Was lodgde in loue, by Cyrces sugred cuppe, Plato deuine, whose stile the Starres dyd hit, With learned lips of Venus sauce did suppe: His graue precepts stoode him in slender sted, Whome lawe of kinde, in lincke of fancie led. Fell Dionyse with Alexander great, Duke Iason, Paris, Pirrhus, Pompey take, And he whome Dydo did so well entreate, That to the curteous Queene his vowe did breake: Yea Ioue him selfe, Apollo, Mars and all, To Venus bowde, each one was Cupids thrall. The noblest Nimphes that euer were aliue, The queyntest queenes the force of fancie felt, The dayntiest dames durst not with loue to striue, The haughtiest harts, had Cupid made to mete: Medea, Phillis, Helen, Phedra fierce, Creula, Oenon, Lucrece loue did pierce. Laodamie, Hermyon Hypsiphill, Curst Clitemnestra, Brisies, Deyanire, Semyrami, and Progne prone to kill, With Mirrha Biblis lust to loue did stirre: And thousands moe, of whome the Poetes tell, Prouokt by loue, to flaming fancy fell. Which sith is so, I may with better face A pardon craue of you that Ladies be, For bringing here a homely wench in place, And ranking her with dames of gallant glee: Who sith did rage in fancie as the rest, Why should she not be plast among the best? Put case her byrth was base, her linage lowe, Her parynts poore, her liuelod bare and thin, Sith Cupid did his golden shaft bestowe Upon her brest, when liking entred in, Let her receiue the guerdon that is dewe To faithfull loue, and march with Cupids crewe. Where leaue is lowed for each one to contend, Where markes are made the cunningst hand to trie, Without reproofe each one his bowe doth bend And arrowes there without controlement flie: Likewise sith loue at rendon roues his dartes, We ought not scorne the meanest louing hartes, When Cresus brings his gorgeous giftes in hand, And slay an oxe to offer to the goddes, A groome with gote by him may boldly stand, In holy Church they little count of oddes: The minde is all that makes or marres the thing, A Carter loues as whotly as a King. [A merchants sonne that Girolanus hight] The Argument to the tenth Historie. A merchants sonne that Girolanus hight, Of tender age, in great good liking fell VVith one Saluestra, a damsell faire and bright, A taylers daughter, who there by did dwell: The aged father did, and left the boy Abounding welth, his heyre and only ioy. The carefull mother doubting least her sonne VVold make his choice, &amp; marie with this maide Dispatcht him thence to Paris, there to wonne, Vntill his heate and humor were delaide. To please his friends away this yonker rode, And there a space (vnwilling) made abode. Retires in fine to Florence backe againe, VVhen mothers feare &amp; doubts were layde aside, His auncient loue aye sticking in his brayne: But ere he came, the wench was woxe a bryde, VVhich greude him sore, he wist not how to deale At last deuisde into her house to steale. VVhere being plast, vnwist of any wight, He stayde his time, till husband fel on sleepe, Then out he gate, defenst with darke of night, And softly to Saluestras bed did creepe: He sighde, he sued, he pleaded there for life, In hope to had his pleasure of the wife. But al for nought, his winde did shake no corne The womans will was bent another way: VVhich when he found, as one that was forlorne He wist not how to do, nor what to say: His griefe was such, as by Saluestras side He laide him downe, and there for sorow dyde. The husb?d wakes, the wife bewrayes the case, The corse was streight conueyde away by night, When morow came, the beare was brought in place, The graue was cast, the body lay in sight, The mother mournd, and many matrons moe, Bewayl the chaunce of him that died so. Among the rest that present were to viewe This heauie hap, Saluestra stoode as than, She sawe her friend, whom she vnkindly slewe, And therewithall to rewe his death began: So deepely sanke remorse into this dame, As downe she fell, and dyde vpon the same. As auncient men report, there dwelt A Merchant man of yore In Florence, who by traficke had Increast his stocke to more Than any of his race had done, A very wealthy wight: Who on his wife begate a sonne That (Girolamus) hight. And after time the babe was borne, The father chaunst to die, But (as it hape) he made his will Before, and orderly Disposde his goods, as men are wont: The carefull mother then, A widow left, with good aduise And ayde of learned men. The tutors of this merchants sonne, Both vsde the infant well, And gaue such eye vnto his stocke As nought to damage fell. This childe (as common order is) Did vse to sport and play Among the other neighbors babes, To driue the time away. And (as the childrens custome is, Some one among the rest To fancy most,) euen so this boy Did like a mayden best A Taylers daughter dwelling by: They daily vsde to meete With sundrie other babees moe Amid the open shreete. This liking in their tender yeeres Shot vp, and grew to more, Euen as their limms encreast by age, The sparke which loue before Had kindled in his wanton brest, Did growe to greater fire, And Girolamus in his heart The mayden did desire. Their daily custome came to kinde, And looke what day that he Had past without the sight of her, He thought it lost to be. And that which set the flaxe on fire, And bred the hoter flame, Was, that the boy did well perceiue The mayden ment the same, And likte aswell of him againe, The mother when she sawe This matter worke, began to checke. And keepe the wagge in awe, And whipt him now and then among: But when she did perceiue The stubborne stripling set her light, And that he would not leaue Those wanton trickes, vnfit for youth, She woxe a wofull dame: And to the tutors of her sonne This pensiue widowe came, (As one that of that crabtree thorne An Orenge tree would fayne Haue made, because his stocke was great, But all her toyle was vaine.) And to the sages thus she said, Ungracious graffe my sonne, Scarce fourteene yeeres of age as yet, Already hath begonne, And entred in the snare of loue: The wagge begins to frie With one Saluestras liking lust, A taylours daughter by. So that vnlesse me wise by deale, And warely seeme to watch, At length (perhaps) this foolish elfe Will with the mayden match, And make a rash contract with her: Which if should happen so, From that time foorth, I should not liue A merrie day I knowe. Or if he should consume and wast With thought, or pine away, To see her matcht some other where, Then woe were me I say. Wherefore to voyde this present ill, I thinke it best (quoth shee) That you conuey him hence in hast, If you be ruld by me. Cause him to trauaile in affayres Concerning Merchants trade: For that perhaps by absence from The maide, he may be made To quite forget his wanton loue, And put her out of minde, And make some other better choyce. Abroade the boy shall finde, A wench that is descended well, To linke himselfe withall: No doubt, I see him fullie bent By loue to hazard all The tutors liked well the tale The mother widow told, And made her promise presently To doe the best they could, By counsell and by good aduise. And thereupon they sent A messenger vnto the ympe, That to the warehouse went, And wild the boy so come away: Who, being come in place, The one began to speake him thus With milde and friendlie face. My sonne, sith you are past a childe, I would your wit allow, If you would somewhat looke about Unto your profite now, And see your selfe where all goe right That doth concerne your gaine: We, that your tutors are, agree, (If you will take that paine) That you to Paris trauaile, ther To stay a certaine space: For, there, your father, whilst he liude, In banke your wealth did place, Euen there your chiefest traficke lyes: And eke besides the same, You shall your selfe to manners good And better fashion frame, By lodging in so trim a towne Where lustie gallants be, There shall you store of Gentlemen, And brauest Barons see. And hauing learned their good grace, And markt their vsage well, You may returne you home againe, Among your friends to dwell. The boy did note his tutors tale, That did perswade him so, And brieflie made answere, that He did not minde to goe To Paris, for he thought he mought Aswell in Florence stay As any one, what neede he then To trauaile thence away. The sages being answerde thus, Unto the widdow went, And tolde the mother how her sonne, The wilfull wag, was bent. The matrone, mad to heare the newes, Spake not a word at all Of Paris matters, but foorthwith Unto his loue did fall: Controuling him for roysting rule, And for his baudie life: And did not let to tell him, how He meant to take a wife. But, as the mothers manner is, For euery bitter checke, Shee gaue her sonne a honie sop, And hung about his necke: And flattred him againe as fast, And did the boy entice By all the friendly meanes she might To follow their aduise: The mother widow preached had Unto her sonne so long, Of this and that, and in his eare Had sung so sweete a song: As for a yeere to trauell well, The boy perswaded was, To stay in Fraunce, and so his time In forraine Realme to passe. I leaue the taking of his horse, I write not of his woe: I passe of purpose all his plaints His countrie to forgoe. I doe omit his bitter teares At time of his remoue, For those to deeme, that haue assaide The pangs of pensiue loue. I write not of the mothers griefe, To bid her sonne farewell, For that herselfe was pleasde withall And likt his voyage well. To Paris when this gallant came, Loue gaue the charge anew Upon his heart, the fight was fierce, A greater fancie grew Within his bosome, than before: The absence from her face, Might not delay the hote desire That had this youth in chace. And thus, the boy, that meant at first But for a yeere to stay, Full two yeeres out, in burning loue In Fraunce at Paris lay. Which time expyrde, inwrapped more In flakes of fancies flame, Than when he went from Italy, He backe to Florence came, And being there arrivde, he heard His auncient friend was sped: A certaine Curten maker hapt This wench meane while to wed. Whereat he greatly greeued was, And vexed out of crie: But seeing that there was no choice, Nor other meanes to trie. He purposde with himselfe a truce His sorowes to expell. But at the length he had espide Where did this damsell dwell, And found her standing at her dore: Then grew this youth in heate, And as enamored wights are wont, He gan the streetes to beate, Both vp, and downe, both to and fro, He vsed oft to stalke Before the Curten makers house, In hope by often walke That she would pitie of his paines, And eke his torment rue, He verliy presumde that shee Her Girolanus knewe. But fortune fell not out aright, Shee knew the man no more, Than one whom earst shee neuer same In all her life before. Or if shee did remember him, At least shee made in wise She wist not who the Marchant was, So coy shee kest her eyes On Girolamus passing by. Yet he would neuer leaue His wonted walke, in hope at last Same fauour to receaue: Deuising all the meanes he might To bring the wife againe In minde of him, who was her loue, Her strangenesse bred his paine. It greende the Marchant to the guts That he was so forgote: In fine he purposde with himself (His feuer was so hote) To speake with her, although it cost The loosing of his life: And heere vpon, instructed by The neighbours, where the wife Whom he entirely loude did dwell, Hee watcht his season so, That, when the husband and his spouse, With other neighbours mo, Were walkt abroade to keep the watch, He slilie did conuey Himselfe into Saluestras house: And being there, he lay Behinde the Curtaines, nie the bed, Unspide of any man. The Curtain maker and his wife Returned home, began To take their rest in wonted wife. The man was sound asleepe As soone as he was laid in couche: Then gan this youth to creepe, Upon his knees, vnto the side Whereas Saluestra lay, And hauing softly plast his handes Upon her pappes, gan say: What are you (sweeting) yet a sleepe? With that the wife dismaide, Would haue exclaimde, (as women wont In such like sort afraide) Saue that the Marchant presently Her friendly thus bespake. Alas, my Deere, exclaime not now, You need no thought to take, For I am Girolamus, he That tender your estate. She hearing that, said, all afraid, What make you here so late? Good Girolanus get you hence, Those youthfull yeeres are spent Wherein it was our hap to loue, That time good faith I ment: Then lawfull was the thing we did. But now you see that I Am otherwise bestowde and matcht, I must not now apply My liking, but to him alone. Wherefore, I pray, quoth shee, For loue of God depart this place Your purpose may not bee. For if my husband wist yon heere, (Put case none other ill Ensude thereof) yet this be sure, I should haue chiding still: Your being here would breede debate, And purchase deadly strife, Whereas with him, as now I leade A iollie quiet life, I am his darling well belovde. When Girolanus had Both heard, and noted all her talke, Hee were exceeding sad. His heart was pierst with pensiue woe To heare the tale shee tolde, Then gan hee wrie his former loue, And all his flame vnfolde. Declaring her, that distance had Not flakte his burning fire: And made request withall, that she Should graunt him his desire. He promisde golden mountaynes then, But all his sute was vayne: No iote of friendship for his life, The merchant mought attaine. Wherefore desirous then to die, Saluestra he besought, That in rewarde of all his loue, And all his former thought Which he had suffered for her sake, She would but yelde him grace To warme himselfe within her bed, Fast by her side a space: Whose flesh so maner frozen was, With staying there so long, He made her promise on his faith He mould not offer wrong Unto Saluastra, no not once Let fall a worde so mutch, Nor yet her naked carkasse with His manly members tutche: But hauing taken there a heate, And warmde himselfe in bed, He would depart, and deeme that he Sufficiently had sped. Saluestra taking pitie then Of Gyrolamus case, Upon the promise made before Did yelde him so much grace, As on her bed to stretch him selfe The youth thus being laid Besides his mistres, toucht her not But with him selfe he waid The great good wil that he so long Within his brest had borne: Upon her present rigor eke He thought, and shamefull scorne. And being brought to deepe dispaire, He purposde not to liue, But die the death without delay, And vp the ghost to geue. And hereupon his sprites withdrew Themselues from outward parts, His senses fled, he stretcht him selfe, And so the youth departs Fast by Saluestras sauage side To whom he sude for grace: When Girolam thus dead had line Upon her bed a space The wench did wonder very much That he was woxe so chaste. Whose flame of late so burning was And fancie fride so fast. At length in feare her husband would Awake, she gan to say Oh Gyrolamus how be this? When wil you packe away? But hearing him no answere make She thought him sound asleepe Which made her reach her hand to wake, The man that slept so deepe. She felt and found him colde as yce Whereof she marueld much: And therupon with greater force She gan his limmes to touch. And thrust him, but he stirred not, With that within her head The wife conceaued and wist ful wel That Girolam was dead. Where of she was the soriest wench, That euer liued by breath: She knew not what to doe to see So strange and sodaine death. But yet at last she did deuise To feele her husbands thought In person of another, not As though her selfe had wrought Or been a party in the fact. Put case, good sir (quoth she,) A yonker loued a maried wife As I my selfe mought be: And comming to her chamber late, In hope to winne the wife, Were both begilde of all his hope, And eke berefte of life, By only force of franticke loue And lacke of his desire, And want of pities water, to Delay his scalding fire. What would you doe in such a pinche? How would you deale as than? Whereto the husband answered, that He would conuay the man Unto his home, without mistrust Or malice to the dame His wife, that had resisted so The force of Cupides flame. Which wh? she herd, she answered thus Then (husband) doth it lye Upon vs nowe to practise that, And eake that tricke to trye. And taking of his hand, she put It on the coarse that laye Upon the other side of her, As colde as any kaye. Wherat the wilfull wight dismayde, And ierst with sodaine feare, Lepte of the bed full sore amazde, To feele a body there. And out he ran to lighten linke, Without debating more Of further matter with his wife, Of what they spake before. The candle light bewrayed the corse, He sawe the partie playne, He made no more a doe, but put Him in his robes agayne, And bore him on his shoulders thence: And knowing verie well His lodging, set him at the doore, Where did his mother dwell: When day was come, and people sawe The carkasse of the dead Before the gate, the fame thereof Throughout the citie spread. Each one did wonder at the chaunce, That passed by the way, They knewe the partie passing well, But wist not what to say. Yet most of all, the mother musde, And vexed was in minde, That hauing searchte the body, coulde No wounded member finde. Which made Phisitions flatly say, That sorowe stopte his breath: With one assent they all agreede, That griefe did cause his death. As custome is, the corse was borne Into a temple by Where merchant men of his estate And welthie wights did lie. The mourning mother thether came To waile her sonnes decease And with the matrone thousands moe Of neighbors more and lesse. Were come to church to shed their teares Saluestras husband then. Perceiuing that the preace was great, Of women and of men, Ran home &amp; wilde his wife do on A kerchiefe on her head: And throng amid the wiues to beare What newes went of the dead. And he him selfe thrust in among The men, to learne what they Imaginde of the marchants death, Where any one did say Or had him in suspect thereof Saluestra hereupon Made hast to church, and felt remorse Within her brest anone. But all to late her pitie came, For she desired to vew Him being dead, whom earst aliue She tooke disdaine to rewe. Or recompence so much as with A kisse. O wenche vnkind, A maruels thing, to thinke how hard It is for man to finde Or sounde the depth of louers thoughts, Or knowe the force of loue: For loe hir brest, whom Gyrolams Good fortune might not moue, Nor during life procure to ruth, His death did raze hir harte. His misaduentures did renewe The stroke of Cupides darte. Hir auncient flame rekindled was, And to such pitie grewe, When as she did the carcasse dead Of Gyrolamus vewe, That being but in simple weede, As meanest women were, By one and one she gate before The richest matrons there, Not stintyng till she came vnto The body where it lay, And being there she gaue a shoute, And yelded forth a bray. So loude as for hir life she could, And groueling with hir face, On Gyrolamus carcasse fell, His bodie to imbrace. And bathde his limmes with brackish teares, That issued from her eyes As long as life would giue her leaue: Which done, Saluestra dyes. And looke how griefe &amp; hidden thought, Had slayne her desperate friend, Euen so remorse of couerte cares, Her loathed life did ende. Which when y? mourning matrons saw Eache one in friendliest wise, To comfort her in words began, And willd her thence to rise, As then not witting who she was: But at the last, when that She would not mount, but lay me still Upon the body flat, They came to lift her on her legges, And rayse her from the grounde, And then, both that the wife was dead, And who she was, they founde. Saluestra then she did appeare, Then dubble woxe the woe Of all the wiues that mourners were, When they the dame did knowe. Then gan they mourne as fast againe As ere they did before, For euery sighe, a hundred sobbes, For euery teare a score. This brute no sooner out of Church, Among the people came: But out of hand her husband hearde The tidings of the same. Who (as I said) was gone among The men, to lend an eare, And hearken what report there went Of them that died there. Then like a louing husband, that Imbrast Saluestra well, From sobbing sighes, to trickling teares, For her misfortune fell. And waild her death no little time, And after that, to some That were in place, declard, by night How Gyrolam did come Unto his house, through burning loue Which he Saluestra bore, And tolde the tale from point to point, As I haue pend before. Whereat the audience wofull woxe, That vnderstood the case, Then taking vp the carkasse of The wife that lay in place, And hauing knit the shrowding sheete, As common custome is, They layd her body on the beare, And set her side to his. Thus hauing wept vpon the dead In proofe of inward paine: And buried both together, home The people went againe, See lucke, whom loue was not of force, Aliue to linke in one: Death found the meanes to couple close, Within a marble stone. Lenuoy. VVhether stars doe stir good lykyng from aboue, By hidden force and couert power deuyne Or chaunce breede choyce &amp; leades vs on to loue And fancy falles as fortune list assigne, I cannot iudge nor perfectly defyne But this I know once let it gather roote And to remoue it then is slender boote. Let sicknes grow, let cankers worke theyr wyl Seeke not at first their malyce to suppresse Scorne wholsome helpe doe floute at physikes skil In hope thy greefe wyl swage and vvaxen lesse And thou at last shalt neuer haue redresse Diseases more admitte no cunning cure The cause by tyme is fastned on so sure. When fire is once crept yn among the straw And flame hath raught the rotten roofe on hye Tis hardly quencht hys fury hath no law It seldome sinkes tyl all on ground do ly The way to help is busily to ply The matter fyrst before it grow too far When steedes are stolne tys bootles doores to barre. Euen so it fares when fancy blowes the cole Of frendship first and sets abroach good will A man may ympes with ease from loue controle Whilst feare doth force them stoupe to parents wyl But let them run their race at ryot styl And not rebukte by reason at the fyrst Along they go let parents doe their worst. Too late comes salues to cure confyrmed sores When loue is linkt and choyce is chayned fast You may as soone plucke trees vp by the rootes As breake the knot or sunder promise past The tackle hangs so sure vnto the Mast When shype from shore haue hoyste vp all their sailes, To bend about againe it little vailes. So statelie is the stroke of Cupids bow, So fell his force, so huge his heauie hand, No striuyng serues, no shift to shun the blow. No might nor meane his Godhead to withstand, Who fastest runnes sinks deapest in the sands: Wherefore I wish that parents giue consent, And not repine when mindes to match are bent. For barre the sick whom Feuer doth molest, To drinke his fill, his thirst will be the more, Restraine thy Ienates course, thy bridle wrest, The beast becommes farre fiercer than before, Where streames be stopt, there riuers most doe rore, Downe goe the banks, and ouer flowes the flood, Where swellyng waters feele themselues withstood. No trauayle serues to sunder louing heartes, No absence breedes in friendes forgetfull mindes, The farther of that ech from other parts, The hotter ech his flaming fancie findes. Who striues to stop, doth most enrage the wynds: No louer true, but beares within hys brest, The shape of her whom he doth fancie best. As thunder showres, whom weather calmes againe, Gyue greater drought and helpes along the string, By meanes of heate mixt with the blowting raine: So safe returne of absent friends, doth bring Increase of loue and faster streames the spryng: Respect of birth, of state, or ought beside, Stops not the boat, that driues with such a tide. A folly then for parents to restraine, For lucres sake their children, sith we see That both theyr care and labour is in vaine, And sundrie times a thousand ples there bee That doe ensue, when they will not agree: Is in this tale the Florentine doth showe The great mishaps by such restraint that grow. Could mothers threates, or tutors taunts reuoke This Marchants minde, or make him alter loue, Could Parris pleasure once this youth prouoke, His auncient friend from fancie to remoue? Yea, though it were a thing for his behoue, No, backe he came the selfe same man he went, He chaungde the ayre, but not his first entent. And loue, to helpe him onward on his race, Assisted with deuise and subtile sleight, Eke Uenus taught him how to come in place, And shrowded him in cloudie cloke of night, Whereby he might approch to his delight, But all for nought. The game that he pursude, Was caught before, and thence his bane ensude. So Pyramus in Babylon of yore, Faire Thisbe loued, but parents disagreed, They might not match, but prisoned were therefore: Yet loue at length this faithfull couple freed, The time was set, the place and all decreed, When foule mishap bereft them both of life, Who slue themselues with one vnluckie knife. Had pitie lodge within Saluestras brest, Would she haue forst so true a man to die, Who chargde with loue and thousand woes distrest, Did hazard life to presse in place so nie, Unto a dame that with her spouse dyd lie? O blooddie Beare, nay rather Tygers whelp That would refuse her auncient friend to helpe. O marble mynde O stayne of womans stocke Not fed with milke of kindly nurses pappe But hewed with toole out of some ruthles rocke And layd withyn some Lionesses lap Couldst thou alow thy frend so hard a hap As by thy syde amid his sute to see Him dee the death and all for loue of thee? Draw hether dames and read this bloody fact Note wel the fruite of frovvardnes in loue Peruse the plague of her that pyty lackt See how in that she pleasd the gods aboue Example take your rygor to remoue And you that are Cupydos knyghts take heede Bestovv no more good wil then shalbe need. Renounce the loue of such as are forsped Forgoe those, frends vvhom law forbids to lyke Courte no mans wyfe embrace no maryage bed Leaue of your luste by others harmes to seeke No such good vvyl can last aboue a vveeke Looke vvhen you thynke your selues in cheefest pryce They set you by vvhylst others throvv the dyce. When once regard of honor lyes asyde When credyt is respected nought at all Then shame ensues and follovves after pride From vertue then to fylthy vice they fall And to allure they vse a pleasant call And beyng once entangled in the tvvyg To make you fat they feede you vvith a fyg. For one delyght ten thousand yls ensues For little glee much bytter gall you gayne You may not hope to fynde those vvomen true Theyr husbands beds that doe not stick to stayne And make them serue for clokes agaynst the rayne Wherfore I say force not of any dame That for a frend forgoes an honest name. EPITATHES and Sonnettes annexed to the Tragical histories, By the Author. VVith some other broken pamphlettes and Epistles, sent to certaine his frends in England, at his being in Moscouia. Anno 1569. Omnia probate. Quod bonum est tenete. A farevvell to a mother Cosin, at his going tovvardes Moscouia. Goe post you pensiue lynes, and papers full of woe, Make haste wnto my mothers handes, hir sonnes farewell to showe. Doe marke her lookes at first, ere you your message tell, For feare your sodayne newes, hir minde doe fancie nothing well. But sithen needes you must my trauailes trouth vnfolde, To offer vp her sonnes farewell, and last adewe, be bolde. I know she will accept your comming in good parte, Till time she vnderstand by you that I must needes departe. But when you make reporte that I am shipte from shore, In minde to cut the foming Seas, where winter wyndes do roe rore: Then woe be vnto you, that mournefull message beare, For doubtlesse she with trembling handes will you in sunder teare. But (mother) let your sonne perswade you in this case, For no man sure is borne to leade his life in one selfe place. I must no longer stay aduantage is but vile The cruel lady fortune on your sonne will neuer smile. My countrey coast where I my Nurses milke did sucke, Would neuer yet in all my life allowe me one good lucke. With cost encrease my cares, expences nip me neere, Loue waxeth cold, no frendship doth in natures brest appeere. Where slender is the gaine and charges grow too hie Where liuing lackes and money melts that should the want supply: From thence tis time to trudge and hire the hackney post To shift to ship, to leaue the land and seeke a better coast. Sith I haue all my yeres in studies fond applide And euery way that might procure a better chaunce haue tride. Yet better not my state but like a sotted dolt Consume my time that goes about, to mend a broken bolt. Sith I haue livde so long and neuer am the neere To bid my natiue soile farewel, I purpose for a yeere. And more perhaps if neede and present cause require: They say the countrey is too colde the whotter is the fire. Moscouia is the place, where all good furres be sold Then pray thee (mother) tel me how, thy sonne shall dye with colde. Put case the snow be thicke, and winter frostes be great: I doe not doubt but I shal finde, a stoue to make me sweat. If I with credite goe, and may returne with gaine I hope I shalbe able wel to bide this trauayles paine. The slouthfull Groome that sits, at home and tels the clocke: And feares the floud because therein lies hidden many a rocke. As hee abydes no woe, no welth he doth deserue, Let him that will not cut the loafe for lacke and famine sterue. The Catte deserues no fish that feares her foote to weate, Tis time for me in profite now mine idle braynes to beate. I trust I shall returne farre better than I goe, Increase of credite will procure my simple wealth to growe: Meane while I wishe thee well (good mother mine) to fare, And better than my selfe, who yet was neuer voyde of care. Sith neede obeyes no lawe, and needes I must to barcke, Farewell, and thinke vpon thy sonne, but haue of him no carcke. The Gods I hope will heare the sute that you shall make, And I amid the Sea shall fare the better for your sake. If euer fortune serue, and bring me safe to lande, The harde mishappes of trauayle you by me shall vnderstand. And whatsoeuer straunge or monstrous sight I see. Assure thy selfe at my returne I will declare it thee. Thus euery thing hath ende. and so my letters shall, Euen from the bottom of my brest, I doe salute you all. What so becomes of me the mightie Gods I craue, That you my frendes, a blessed life and happie deathes may haue. That nothing can cause him to forget his frend, vvherein is toucht the hardnes of his trauayle. If boystrous blaste of fierce and froward wynde, If weltring waues, and frothie foming Seas, If shining Sunne by night against his kinde, If lacke of lust to meate, and want of ease, If feare of wracke, and force of rouing foe, If raged Rockes that in the riuers lie: If frozen floodes where sliding Sledds doe goe, If cruell colde vpon the mountaines hye, If seldome sleapes, if sundrie sortes of care, If bareskin beddes, or else a borded bench, If lacke of kindly cates and courtly fare, If want of holsom drinck the thirst to quench, If stinking Stoues, if Cunas and bitter bragge, If sauage men, if women foule to sight, If riding poast vpon a trotting Nagge, If homely yammes, in stead of Innes at night: If these (I say) might make a man forget So true a frend, then thou art out of minde. But in good fayth, my fancie firme was set, No Russie mought the true loue knot vnbinde. Venus be iudge, and Cupid in this case, Who did pursue me aye from place to place. He declares that albeit he were imprisoned in Russia, yet his minde was at libertie, &amp; did daily repaire to his frend. Now finde I true that hath bene often told, (No man may reaue the freedome of the mind,) Though kepers charge in chaines the captiue hold, Yet can he not the Soule in bondage binde: That this is true, I finde the proofe in me, Who Captiue am, and yet at libertie. Though at my heele a cruell clogge they tye, And ranging out by rigor be restraynde, Yet maugre might, my minde doth freely flye Home to my frend, it will not be enchainde: No Churles checke, no Tyrants threat can stay A Louers heart, that longs to be away. I doe desire no ayde of Dedalus, By feate to forge such waxen winges anew As erst he gaue his sonne young Icarus, When they from Crete for feare of Mynos flew, Dame Fancy hath such feathers still in store, For me to flie as I desire no more. Il desire non ha riposo. A comparison of his mistresse, with a braue Lady of Russia. Fayre is thy face, and louely are thy lookes, Rich be thy robes and geason to be had White are thine eares, hangde full of siluer hookes Braue be thy bootes, thy body costly clad, With Sable, Sube, thy necke beset with pearle. Thy brodred gyte makes thee a gallant gyrle. The Russies rude doe deeme right wel of thee, Mine english eye no paynted image leekes, I haue a frend that wel contenteth me, With kindly shape and kindly coloured cheekes, Such one she is, as I wil here declare, Fewe are her peeres, I finde her matches rare, Her heare is golden wyer, her shineng eyes Two Dyamondes that glister passing bright, Amids her lylye cheekes, the Rubie lyes, Her teeth of pearle, lippes louely red and white, All other limmes doe aunswere well the same, Now iudge of both which is the brauer dame, La mia donna bella è buona. To his frend promising that though her beautie fade, yet his loue shall last. I wotte full well that bewtie cannot laste, No rose that springs, but lightly doth decay, And feature like a lillie leafe doth waste, Or as the Cowslip in the midst of May: I know that tract of time doth conquer all, And beuties buddes like fading floures do fall. That famous Dame fayre Helen, lost her hewe Wh? withred age w? wrinckles chaungd her cheeks, Her louely lookes did loathsomnesse ensewe, That was the A per se of all the Greekes? And sundrie moe that were as fayre as shee Yet Helen was as freshe as fresh might bee. No force for that, I price your beautie light, If so I finde you stedfast in good will: Though fewe there are that doe in age delight, I was your friend, and so doe purpose still, No change of lookes shall breede my change of loue Nor beauties want, my first goodwill remoue. Per gentilezza, Tanto. Non per bellezza. From the citie of Mosqua, to his friend in England. Go burning sighes, and pierce the frozen skie, Slack you y? snow with flames of fancies fire Twixt Brutus land, and Mosqua that doe lie: Goe sighes I say, and to the Phenix flie, Whome I imbrace, and chieflie doe desire, Report of me that I doe loue her best, None other Saint doth harbour in my brest. Tell her that though the colde is wont by kinde To quench the cole, and ffames do yeeld to frost, Yet may no winters force in Russia binde My heart so heard, or alter so my minde, But that I still imbrace her beautie most: I went her friend, and so cotinue still, Frost cannot freat the ground of my good will. Ardo e ghiaccio. To his mistres, declaring his life only to depend of her lookes. The Salamander cannot liue without the help of flaming fire: To bath his limmes in burning coales, it is his glee and chiefe desire. The litle fish doth loue the lake, dame nature hath assigned him: To liue no longer then he doth amid the siluer channel swimme. Chameleon feedes but on the ayre, the lacke whereof is his decay: These three doe perish out of hand, take fire, flouds, and ayre away. Iudge you (my deere) the danger then of very force that must ensue: Unto this careful heart of mine, that cannot liue withouten you. I am the fish, you are the flood, my heart it is that hangs on hooke: I cannot liue if you doe stoppe, the floudhatch of your frendly brooke. I silly Salamander die, if you maintaine not frendships fire: Quenche you the coale and you shal see me pine for lack of my desire. You are the pleasant breathing ayre, and I your poore Chameleon, Barre me your breath and out of hand my life and sweete delight is gone. Which sith tis so (good mistresse) then doe saue my life to serue your turne Let me haue ayre and water stil let me your Salamander burne. My death wil doe you litle good, my life perhaps may pleasure you: Rewe on my case and pitie him, that sweares himself your seruant true, I beare the badge within my brest, wherin are blazde your colours braue: Loue is the only liuery, that I at your curteous hand doe craue. I doe desire no greedy gaine, I couet not the massye golde: Embrace your seruant (mistres) then, his wages wil be quickly tolde. As you are faire so let me finde your bountie equall to your face: I cannot thinke that kinde so neere, to beauties bower would rigor place, Your comely hewe behight me hope, your louely lookes allow mee life. Your graue regard doth make me deeme, you fellow to Vlisses wife, Which if be true then happy I, that so in loue my fancie set, In you doth rest my life, my death, by slaying me no gaine you get. The noble minded Lion kils no yeelding beast by crueltie, And worthie dames delight to saue their seruants liues by curtesie. Virtuti comes inuidia. My Spencer, spite is vertues deadly foe, The best are euer sure to beare the blame, And enuie next to vertue still doth goe, But vertue shines, when enuie shrinkes for shame. In common weales what beares a greater sway Than hidden hate that hoordes in haughtie brest? In princes courtes it beares the bell away, With all estates this enuie is a guest. Be wise, thy wit will purchase priuie hate, Be rich, with rents flocke in a thousand foes Be stout, thy courage will procure debate, Be faire, thy beautie not vnhated goes. Beare office thou, and with thy golden mace, Commes enuie in, and treades vpon thy traine, Yea, be a Prince, and hate will be in place, To bid him stand aloofe it is in vaine. So that I see, that Boccas wordes be true: For ech estate is pestred with his foe, Saue miserie, whom hate doth not ensue, The begger only doth vnspited goe: Yet beggers base estate is not the best, Though enuie let the begger lie at rest. Sola miseria e senza inuidia, Boccacio. That though he may not possible come or send, yet he liues mindfull of his mistresse in Moscouia. Who so hath read Leanders loue, which he to Ladie Hero bore, And how he swamme through Aelles flood, twixt Abydon and Sestus shore. To gaine his game, to liue at lust, to lay him in the Ladies lap, Will rue his paines, and scarce exchange his case to haue Leanders hap, But happy I account his case, for hauing past those narrow Seas, He was assured to lodge aloft, with Hero in the towre of ease. He neuer went but did enioy, his mistres whom he did desire. He seldome swamme the foming floud, but was assured to quench his fire. The torch it hung vpon the towre, the lampe gaue light to shew the way: He could not misse the darkesome night it shone as cleere as sunny day, Thus happy was Leanders lot, but most vnhappy mine estate: For swimming wil not serue my turne to bring me to my louing mate. The flouds are frozen round about, the snow is thick on euery side: The raging Ocean runnes betwixt my frend and me with cruel tide. The hilles be ouerwhelmde with hoare the countrey clad with mantels white Each tree attirde with flakes of yce, is nothing els saue snow in sight. The mighty Volgas stately streame in winter slipper as the glasse: Abides no boate, how should I then deuise a meane a way to passe? And Suchan that in summer time, was easie to be ouergone: With Boreas blast is bound as harde, as any flint or marble stone, Free passage Dwina doth deny, whose streame is stopt and choakt with snow. There is no way for any barge, much lesse for any man to goe: I cannot for my life repaire, to thee to ease my present paine: There is no passage to be had, til summer slake the snow againe. Meane while yet maist thou make acc?pt, that I doe stil remember thee. In Russia where I leade my life, and long againe at home to be. No force shall cause me to forget or lay the care of loue aside: Time is the touchstone of good will, wherby my meaning shalbe tride. If I might haue conueid my lines, vnto thy hands, it would haue easde, My heauy heart of diuers doubts, my message might my minde appeasde But (friend) indure this long delay my selfe wil come when time shal serue To tell thee newes and how I fare: meane while stand fast &amp; do not swerue Presume that as I was thine owne, euen so I doe continue still. I know hir not whose beautie shall remooue or change my first good will. Thy face hath pierst my brest so farre, thy graces este so many bee, As if I would, I cannot choose but loue, and make account of thee. To a faire gentlevvoman, false to hir friend. VVithin the garden plot of thy faire face, Doth grow a graffe of diuers qualities: A matter rare within so little space, A man to find such sundry properties: For commonly the roote in euery tree, Barcke, body, boughes, bud, leafe, and fruit agree. First for the roote is rigor in the brest, Treason the tree, that springeth of the same, Beautie the barcke that ouerspreds the rest, The boughes are braue, and climing vp to fame, Braules be the buds that hang on euery bowe, A blossom fit for such rootes to allowe. Loue is the leafe that little time endures, Flattrie the fruit which treasons tree doth beare, Though beauties barste at first the eie allure, Yet at the last ill will the worme, doth weare Away the leafe, the blossoms, boughes, and all, And rigors roote, makes beauties buds to fall. Par essere ingrata, Non sarai amata. A farewell to a craftie, deceitfull Dame. As he that lothes the powders smel, must neuer prease where Gunners bee: So he that hates a double dame, must neuer haue to do with thee. For craft I see, is all thy care, thy smoothest lookes be token guiles: In womans wombe thou feedst a foxe, that bites thy friend on whom he smiles. Had Nature wist thy deep deceits before thy birth, I thinke that kind, To saue thy name, and ease thy friends, had seald thine eies, and kept thee blind. For what is she that beares a face of greater trust, and more good will? Yet who is she that hath a heart more prone to pay the good with ill? Thy beautie led me on to loue, thy lookes allured my looking eyes: Thy doublenesse now breeds despaire, thy craft doth cause my wofull cries. I could requite dissembling loue, and gloze perhaps as well as you: But that I take but small delight to change mine ancient friends for new Yet will I not be sorted so, as stil to let my loue to losse, I better know what mettall is, than to exchange the gold for drosse. Good will is euer woorth good will, if both the ballance egall bee: But sure too massie is my loue, to make exchange of loues with thee. Wherfore I say, vnknit the knot wherwith thy loue was falsly tide, Thou lackst a graine to make vp weight, men say, (good measure neuer lide.) Go seeke some other to deceiue, too wel I know thy craftie call: My mouth is very well in taste, to iudge the hony from the gall. That you are gall, I may auow, for hony hath no bitter tast: The wine of your good will is spent, you keep the dregs for me at last. Wherfore I do renounce the caske, I leaue the lees for other men: My hap was ill, my choice was worse, I yeeld you vp to choose agen. Spare to speake, Spare to speede. My Spencer spare to speake, and euer spare to speed, Unlesse thou shew thy hurt, how shall the Surgeon know thy need? Why hath a man a tongue, and boldnesse in his brest, But to bewray his mind by mouth, to set his hart at rest? The fisherman that feares his corke and coard to cast, Or spred his net to take the fish, wel worthy is to fast. The forrestman that dreads to rouse the lodged Bucke, Bicause of bramble brakes, deserues to haue no hunters lucke. Where words may win good wil, and boldnesse beare no blame, Why should there want a fare of brasse to bourd the brauest dame? Unlesse thou cast thy lure, or throw hir out a traine: Thou seldome shalt a Falcon, or a Tassell gentle gaine. Though lookes betoken loue, and makes a shew of lust, Yet speech is it that knits the knot whereto a man may trust, Assure thy selfe, as he that feares caliuer shot, Can neuer come to scale a fort, or skirmish woorth a grote: So he that spares to speake, when time and place are fit, Is sure to misse the marke, which else he were in hope to hit. Giue him an iuie leafe in stead of pipe to play, That dreads to bourd a gallant dame for feare she say him nay. Where venture is but small, and bootie very great, A coward knight will hazard there in hope to worke his feat. Wherfore when time shall serue (my Spencer) spare to blush, Fall to thy purpose like a man, and boldly beat the bush. Who so accounts of losse, doth seldom gaine the game: And blushing cheekes be often bard, for feare of after shame. No doubt, a Lady doth imbrace him more, that dares To tell his tale, than such a one that of his language spares. Deceit is dreaded more, and craft doth rifer raigne, In one that like an image fits, than him that speaketh plaine. Yea, though thy mistresse make, as though she loued no wine, Remember Aesops Foxe, that was too lowe to reach the vine. Take this for certaine troth, the best and brauest bowe, Will stoupe, if so the cause be good, thou knowest my meaning now. Experience hath no peere, it passeth learning farre: I speake it not without my booke, but like a man of warre. Wherfore be bold to boord the fairest first of all, Aye Uenus aides the forward man, and Cupid helps his thrall. Wearie of long silence, he breakes his mind to his mistresse. Not much vnlike the horse that feeles himself orprest With weightie burthen on his backe, doth long to be at rest: So I, whose boiling brest, with fansies floud did flow, Had great desire my great good will with painting pen to show, To ease my wofull hart of long endured paine, And purchace quiet to my mind, whom loue wel nie hath slaine. Beleeue my words (deare dame) dissembling is a sinne, Not mine, but thine, these many days my captiue hart hath bin. But shame, and coward feare, the louers mortall foes, Would neuer condescend that I my meaning should disclose. Till now at length desire my wonted ease to gaine: Did bid me sue for grace, and said I should not sue in vaine. For as thy beautie is farre brauer than the rest, So bountie must of force abound within thy noble brest. Oh, seeke not thou to shed or sucke of yeelding blood: Alas, I thinke to murther me would do thee little good. Whom if you seeme to rue, as I do hope you will, In prayse of your good nature then my hand shall shew his skill. Lo here in pawne of loue, I vowe my selfe to thee: A slaue, a seruant, and a friend till dying day to bee. He vvisheth his dreames either longer or truer. Short is the day wherein I doe not thinke of thee: And in the night amid my sleepe, thy face (deare dame) I see. The dreame delights me much, it cuts my care away: Me thinkes I kisse and clip thee oft, the rest I blush to say. Who happy then but I, whilest sleepe and slumber last: But who (alas) so much a wretch, as I when sleepe is past. For with the sliding sleepe away slips my delight: Departing dreames doe driue away thy countnance out of sight. And then in place of glee, in glydes a crew of care: My panting hart laments, that I do feele my bed so bare. For thou that wert the cause of comfort, art not there: And I poore silly wofull man, in sobs the night do weare. Then curse I cankred chance, that made me dreame of thee, And fansie fond, that fed it selfe with dreames that fained bee. Thus weares away the night consumde in carefull paine: Those restlesse banners beating still, vpon my busie braine. Then drawes the dawning on, I leaue my couch, and rise, In hope to find some pleasant toy, that may content mine eyes. But out alas, I can not see so faire a sight, That can my heauie hart relieue, and daintie eies delight. Each beautie that doth blaze, each visage that I see: Augments my care, in causing me to long and looke for thee. Thus waste I all the night in dreames without desire: Thus driue I on my dayes in loue, that scalds like scorching fire. Yet well content therewith, so that, at my returne Thou pitie me, who for thy sake with Cupids coles do burne. I am the Turtle true, that sits vpon the tree: And waile my woe without a make, and onely wish for thee. Vnable by long and hard trauell to banish loue, returnes hir friend. VVounded with loue, and piercing deep desire Of your faire face, I left my natiue land, With Russia snow to slacke mine English fire, But well I see, no cold can quench the brand That Cupides coles enkindle in the brest, Frost hath no force where friendship is possest. The Ocean sea for all his fearefull flood, The perils great of passage not preuaile, To banish loue the riuers do no good, The mountains hie cause Cupid not to quaile, Wight are his wings, and fansie flies as fast, As any ship for all his sailes and mast. The riuer Dwina cannot wash away With all his waues the loue I beare to thee, Nor Sachan swift loues raging heate delay, Good will was graft vpon so sure a tree. Sith trauaile then, nor frost can coole this fire: From Mosqua I thy frend wil home retire. That he findeth others as faire, but not so faithfull as his frend. I sundry see for beuties glosse that with my mistresse may compare: But few I finde for true good wil that to their frends so frendly are, Looke what she saies I may assure my selfe thereof, she wil not faine: What others speake is hard to trust they measure all their words by gaine. Her lookes declare her louing minde, her countnance and her heart agree: When others laugh they looke as smooth, but loue not halfe so wel as she: The greefe is hers when I am grypte, my fingers ache is her disease: With me though others mourne to sight, yet are their hearts at quiet ease. So that I marke in Cupids court, are many faire and fresh to see: Each where is sowen dame beuties seede but faire and faithfull few there bee. Trauailing the desert of Russia, he complayneth to Eccho, vvith request that she comfort his afflicted state. You hollow hilles and vallies wide, that wonted are to yelde againe: The latter cause of louers cries resound and help me to complaine. Repeate my piteous pensiue plaints, recite my tale when I haue done: Howle out ye hilles and let me heare my voice among your rockes to run. It wil delight my dazed sprites, when I report my mistresse name: Amid my plaint to heare the hilles, at euery call to call the same. Good Eccho shew me thy good will, is no man here but thou and I: Take vp my tale as I lament, and say (Alas) as I doe crie, Was neuer man that did enioy, a better dame then I haue done: But now (Alas) she is alacke, helpe Eccho, helpe, I am vndone Besides mine absence from her sight, another doth possesse my place, And of my haruest sheares the sheaues, helpe Eccho, helpe, lament my case. I know not when I shal returne, or when to see that sweete againe: For (out alas) she is away good eccho helpe to ease my paine. But nought I see it doth auaile, thy talke encreaseth but my woe: It irkes me to recite her name, and misse the saint I honor so. Wherefore sith bootlesse be complaints, and clepings cannot right my case: I bid thee (Eccho) here adew I will goe seeke to see her face. The face that Paris would haue chose, if he had seene her in the mount: Good faith the lady Uenus had been had as then in small account. And as for Pallas and the third, I meane the mighty Iunos grace: I know right wel they would haue hid themselues, and neuer prest in place. For nature made hir not to match, but to exceede and passe the rest: Thrice happy he that can attaine her loue, and to be liked best. He craues his mistresse to accept his wryting being otherwise insufficient to vvinne good liking from her. As many are the meanes, to fall in fancies frame: So diuers be the driftes of men, for to atchieue the same. For some to winne their loues, and purchase priuy grace: With curious tonges like carpet knights doe pleade a fained case. And all to please the eares, and mate their mistresse minde: Of this and that they tell their tales, as they fit leasure finde. Some other wanting chatte, not hauing words at wil: With nimble ioynts, and fingering fine, on Lutes doe shew their skil. By sugred sound to winne, their ladies to their loue: With earnest care those wanton wights, Apollos practise proue. And such as skilfull are, in daunsing doe desire To practise that whereby to set, their frouious harts on fire. Whose breast is sweete to eare, he straines his voice to sing: Thereby vnto his greedy lust his mistresse minde to bring. The martial man at armes, to muster doth delight: And loues to shew his helmed head, before his Ladies sight. In hope to purchase praise, and after praise some grace: For vvomen loue a valiant man that dares defend their case. Thus each one doth attempt, and puts the thing in vre That fittest is to gaine good will, so Faulkners vse the lure. But I vnhappy wight, that can doe nought of these: How might I doe, or what deuise my mistresse minde to please. Where neither tongue can talke nor finger frame with Lute: Nor footing serue to daunce: alas, how should I moue my sute? Not pleasant is my voice vnable to delight: I can doe nought vnlesse it be with pen to shew my plight. I only can in verse, set out a dame to showe And on a wel deseruing frend, a frendly praise bestow. Thus must I hunt for loue wherefoe (good Lady) then In lieu of other finer skilles, accept my ragged pen. Let me by writing win, what others doe by arte: And during life you shal assure, you of a louing hart, No vertue shalbe lodgde within your curteous brest: But I wil blaze the same abroad, as brauely as the best. And as for beuties praise, I wil procure that fame Shal sound it out so loud, that all the world shal read thy name So as by louing me, you shal haue loue againe: And eke the harts of thousands mo for you good wil attaine. I neuer was mine owne sith first I sawe your face: Nor neuer wil, but euer yours, if you wil rue my case. The meane is best. The fire doeth frye, the frost doeth freese the colde breedes care, the heate doeth harme, The middle point twixt both is best, nor ouer-cold, nor ouer-warme. I dreame it not the happy life the needie beggers bag to beare: Ne yet the blessed state of all a mightie Kaisars crowne to weare. That one is cloied with sundry cares, and dies ten thousand times a day: That other still in danger goes, for euery traitors hand to slay. The highest hill is not the place whereon to build the stately bower: The deepest vale it is as ill, for lightly there doth rest the shower. The sailing ship that keepes the shore, vpon the rocke is often rent: And he that ventures out too farre, and tries the stream with waues is hent. For there the wind doth worke his will, there Neptunes churlish imps do raign: The middle way is safe to saile, I mean the mean betwixt the twain. So that the meane is best to choose, not ouer hie, nor ouer lowe: Wherfore, if you your safetie loue, imbrace the meane, let mounting goe. To his friend Edward Dancie of Deceit. Dancie, deceit is rifer now a day, Then honest dealing, vertue is but vile, I see dissembling beares the bell away: Craft hath a cloke to couer all his guile, And vnderneath the same a knife doth lurke, When time shall serue a shamefull spoile to worke. Each man almost hath change of faces now, To shift at pleasure, when it may auaile: A man must giue no credit to the browe, The smoothest smiling friend will soonest faile, No trust without a triall many yeeres, All is not gold that glistringly appeeres. Who so shall make his choice vpon a man To loue, and like, must warily looke about, A faithfull friend is like a coleblacke Swan. We may not trust the painted sheath without, Unlesse good lucke continue at a stay, Farewell thy friends, like foules they flie away. Of the right noble L. VVilliam, Earle of Pembroke his death. Though betters pen the praise of him that earned fame, Yet pardon men of meaner skill if they attempt the same. Good will may be as great in simple wits to write, In commendation of the good, as heads of deeper sight. Wherfore among the rest that rue this Earles want, Myselfe will set my Muse abroach, although my vaine be scant. This Realme hath lost a lampe, that gaue a gallant show: No stranger halfe so strange to vs but did this Noble know. His vertues spred so farre, his worthy works so wide, That forrain princes held him deere, where so he was imploid. Whose wit such credite won in countrey seruice still, That Enuie could not giue the checke, nor rancor reaue good will. He euer kept the roume that prince and fortune gaue: As curteous in the countrey, as in court a Courtier braue. To low and meanest men a lowly mind he bore, No hawtie hart to stoute estates, vnlesse the cause were more. But than a Lions hart this dreadfull Dragon had: In field among his foes, as fierce, as in the Senate sad. Had Pallas at his birth for Pembroke done hir best, As nature did: then Pembroke had surmounted all the rest. For though that learning lackt to paint the matter out: What case of wright so weightie was, but Pembroke brought about? By wit great wealth he wonne, by fortune fauour came: With fauor friends, and with the friends, assurance of the same. Of Princes euer praisd aduaunst and staid in state: From first to last commended much, in honors stoole he sate. Beloued of Henry well, of Edward held as deere: A doubt whether sonne or father loued him best, as might appeere. Queene Mary felt a want, if Pembroke were away: So greatly she affied him, whilest she did beare the sway. And of our peerelesse Queene, that all the rest doth passe, I need not write, she shewd hir loue whose Steward Pembroke was. Sith such a noble then by death our daily foe, Is reft this realme, why do we not by teares our sorowes show? Why leaue we to lament? why keepe we in our cries? Why do we not powre out our plaints by condites of the eies? Our noble prince, our peeres, both poore and rich may rue, And each one sorow Pembroke dead, that earst him liuing knew. Yt ioy in one respect, that he who liued so hie, In honors seat his honor saued, and fortunde so to die. Which stocke of noble state sith cruell death hath reft, I wish the branches long to bud, that of the roote are left. And prosper so aliue as did this noble tree, and after many happy dayes, to die as well as hee. Finding his Mistresse vntrue, he exclaimeth thereat. Sunne, cease to shine by day, restraine thy golden beames: Let starres refuse to lend their light, let fish renounce the streames. Sea, passe thy kindly bounds, set ebbe and flood aside: Brasse leaue to grow, yet gallant plants, depart with all your pride. Bend Tyber backe againe, and to thy spring returne: Let firie coles begin to freeze, let ise and water burne. Wolues leaue to slay the Lambs, hounds hunt the Hare no more: Be friend to foules, ye hungry haukes whom ye pursude before. For kind hath altred course, the law that nature set, Is broken quite, hir orders skornd, and bands in sunder fret. Loue is accounted light, and friendship forced nought: My selfe may well proclaime the same, that loue hath dearly boaght. I fortund once to like and fansie such a dame: As sundry serud, but none atchieud hir feature wan hir fame. Long sute and great desart, with triall of my truste Did make hir fansie me againe, she found me perfit iust. But ere I felt the blisse, that louers do attaine: I bode a thousand cruell foes, ten thousand kinds of paine. Till ruth by reason grew and rigor layd apart: On me she did bestow hir loue, that best deserued hir hart. Then mirth gan counter poise the griefs I felt before: And if I had endured smart I ioyed than the more. She past me many vowes, and sundry sorts of hest: And swore I was the onely wight whom she did fansie best. Then happy who but I, that did beleeue the same? As who is he that would refuse to credite such a dame? O friend when I (quoth she) shall alter my good will, And leaue to loue thee passing well, thy fansie to fulfill: When I for gallant gifts, for mucke or glittring gold: For comely limmes of courtly knights, delightfull to behold: For Kaisars kingly crowne thy friendship do defie: O Gods (quoth she) renounce me then, and let me monster die. These words and sacred vowes might quicklie credit gaine: For who in such a case would glose or go about to faine? Yet now for all hir speech and glauering talke she vsed, She is reuolted, and hir friend too fowlie hath abusd: Though not against hir kind, (for Ladies are but light,) And soone remooue but cleane against their othes and promise quite. But what should we expect from thornes, no Rose perdie: The figtree yeelds a fig, on vines the grapes in clusters bee. Which sith I find at last though greatly to my paine: Loe here I do defie the fate in whom such craft doth raigne. Farewell thou shamelesse shrew, faire Cresides heire thou art: And I sir Troylus earst haue been, as prooueth by my smart. Hencefoorth beguile the Greekes, no Troyans will thee trust: I yeeld thee vp to Diomed, to glut his filthie lust. And do repute my selfe herein a blessed man, Who, finding such deceit in thee, refuse thy friendship can. For sundry times we see, the sots that serue in loue, Can neuer purchase freedome, nor their frantike rage remoue. But who so hath the grace to banish fond desire, I count him blest of mightie Ioue, for few or none retire. So sweete is sinfull lust, the venome is so vile: As Circes cup no sooner might the bowsing Greeks beguile. Now hang abroade thy hookes. bestowe thy baytes elsewhere, Thy pleasant call shall haue no power to lure my cunning eare. I tride thy twigges too much, my feathers felt thy lime: To giue thee vp, and shunne thy shiftes, I coumpt it more than time. A warning that she be not vncourteous. I chuse you not to change, I entred band to bide: But plighted promise cract by you I count my selfe vntide. No hest is to be held, no vow of valew, when You dames the coller slip: by craft to compasse men. Presume not of good wil, because I swore you loue: For faithful frends vpon abuse, their fancy may remoue. Which lincke of loue vndone repentance comes too late: The fort is wonne when truth is slaine and treason keepes the gate. No teares can purchase truce, no weeping winnes good wil: True loue once lost by due desart, is not renewde by skil. Good meaning may not serue, to feede your frends withall: As wit in words, so trueth in deedes, appeeres, and euer shal. Who so doth runne a race, shall surely sweate amaine And who so loues, shal hardly gloze or secret hidden paine. Way wel my loue at first recall to retchlesse thought, The fiery fittes, the pensiue panges, which I ful deerely bought. Before I tooke the tast, of what I lykte so well: And then consider careles, how to Iunos yoke you fel. Forget not how for gaine and mucke your match was made: When I the while (poore man) was forst a weery life to trade, The Lions loue refusde the noblest beast of all, Unto a sotte you yokt your selfe, and woxe a willing thrall. Then who wiould force but I, or hold the iewel deere. That on anothers finger fits and hath done many a yeere. And long is like to doe, the hogge that gapes for hawes, That hang so fast, may groynd his tuskes and die with emptie iawes. I speake it not of spight, but sure you ill deserue: A man that meanes so wel as I, sith you doe dayly swerue. A foole by foule abuse, shall haue you more at becke: Then he that euer loued you well and neuer gaue you checke. Which shewes that either wit, or faithful loue you lacke: Beware in time, misliking growen, may not be bended backe. When Cresid clapt the dish, and Lazerlike did goe: She rewde no doubt that earst she did, the Troyan handle so. And might she then retirde, to beuties auncient towre: She would haue stucke to Priams sonne, of faithful loue the floure. But fond, too late she found that she had been too light: And ouerlate bewaild that she for went the worthy knight. Imprint it in your brest, and thinke that Ladies lot May light on you, with whom your frend is causlesse thus forgot. I would be loth to loue, and leaue with losse againe: I smarted once, and you (none els) the ground of all my paine. Time tries the trusty minde, which time doth councell me To deale my loue by equall weight least I deceiued be. Where counsel nor aduice, can take no better holde: The losse is light: for colour I imbrace not glowing golde. No more I way a frend, for feature of her face: Her dealing wel must binde good will. vprightly iudge my case. I wholly was your owne, and lesse you loue a looke: The match betwixt vs two is marde, and I your frend to seeke. If any els deserue a share or better part: Let me but know your mind, and then adue with all my hart. I sound the trumpet now, that warning geues to you: To leaue to loue besides my selfe, to whom the whole is due. I tell you this betimes, as one that would be loath By your desert to choose againe, and breake mine auncient oth. Which if by fortune fall, allowe your selfe the thankes: Whose parts vnkind may force a man to play vnfriendly prankes. To one whom he had long loued, and at last was refused vvithout cause, and one imbraced that least deserued it. Che prende diletto di far frode Non si delamentar, si altri le inhanna. If lyking best with fancy firmely set, If louing most, with retchlesse care of state, If true good will, whom time could neuer fret, If pardoning faults, which now I rewe too late, If good stil done, and euer meant to you: Are not of force to make your frendships true. If foule abuse and tearmes of loathsome sound, If mischiefe meant, and seldome good bestowed, If black defame and credit brought to ground If base reports so rashly spread abroad, Can winne good wil, and binde a surer band: Then he that loues and beares you not in hand. Then happy he that workes your deepe decay, And slaunder seekes to both your open shames, For he doth laugh and beare the bel away, Unlucky I with whom so il it frames, As now at last in guerdon of my toyle: I reape refuse and bide this second foile. Wel may he laugh that is my deadly foe, And I lament impatient of my paine, Il may she fare whose craft hath causde my woe, And fickle faith deceiued me thus againe. But I too blame as many foulers bee. Who had the bird in hand and let her flee. More wise then you the babe that feeling flame And once indangerd of the burning blaze, Doth straight refuse the touching of the same, But you much like the gnat doe loue to gaze, And flee so long about the candle light: As both wil seare your wings and carcasse quight. The slaue that serues his prentiship in paine Not halfe so much a wretch as wretched I, For he doth end his yeeres with certaine gaine, Where I haue leaue the hardest hap to trie, And hopelesse quite of what by due was mine To grone in greefe, and with my paines to pine. Wel, wel, content, sith chaunce and you agree I take my hap though cleane against my wil Enforst by you my faith and frend I flee, You must by kinde remaine a woman stil, Who lookes to haue the crowe to change his blacke Before it chaunce perchance his eyes may lacke. Sith you can rule (as by report you may,) (And that to rule is it you women craue) Begin your raigne, God graunt he doe obey That long in yoke hath kept you like a slaue, I feare, I wish, I hope the time wil bee: When Loue daies made for lucre wil not gree. Sticke fast to him who bolsters your estate, Forgiue the faults that haue been done amisse, Forget reports, cling closely to your mate, But thinke on him sometime that wrote you this, If euer chaunce doe make your bondage free: God send your second choyce like this to bee. And as for him whose helping hand hath done, The best it might to worke my cruel woe, I trust in time when all the threede is sponne, Shall deepely rewe that he abusde me so. That womans spite all other spites exceedes: It doth appeere by both your cursed deedes. If my desert to him had been so ill, Then could I not on him haue laid the blame, If mine abuse to you had crackt good will, Yours were the praise and mine the open shame, I loued you both, and yet doe reape at last: But hate from both, for all my frendship past. 1. Due volte me hai ingannato. 2. Supplicio al mondo non e dato, Maggior, quanto pate vn che inamorato. 3. Qual lieni foglie, le dome sono, e crude piu che tasso Piu che Tigre inclementi, &amp; disdegnose, Piu che orse, &amp; piu che luge empie e rabbiose. Hanno piu inganni, che non hanno capelli in capo. 4. O quante, arte &amp; inganni ha il sesso feminino. O quanti lacci? O quanti nodi, e groppi? Per far huomini venir deboli e zorpi. A lio ingrata, troppo amata. An Epitaph vpon the death of Henry Sydhnam, and Giles Bampfield Gentlemen. As rife as to my thought repaires that drearie doleful day, And most vnluckie houre (alas) that hent my friend: away: So oft my brest is like to burst, and ribs to rend in twaine: My liuer and my lungs giue vp, my hart doth melt amaine. And to decipher inward griefs that crush my carcasse so: The sluces of mine eyes so slip, and let their humor go. Out flies the floud of brackish teares, whole seas of sorow swell: In such abundance from my braine, as wo it is to tell. Why do I then conceale their names? what means my sluggish pen, To hide the haps and lucklesse lot of these two manly men. Sith silence breeds a smothering smart, where sundry times we see: That by disclosing of our mindes great cares digested bee. Wherfore my mournfull Muse begin, &amp;c. So Fortune would, the cankred Kernes, who seldom ciuil are, Detesting golden peace, tooke armes, and fell to frantike war. Up rose the rude and retchlesse rogues with dreadfull darts in hand: And sought to noy the noble state of this our happy land. Whose bedlam rage to ouerrule, and fury to confound: The L. of Essex chosen was, a noble much renownd. Away he went awaited on of many a courtly knight: Whose swelling harts had fully vowed to daunt their foes in fight. Among the rest (I rue to tell) my Sydnham tooke the seas: Gyles Bampfield eke aboord he leapt, his princes wil to please. Whose martial minds and burning brests were bent to beare the broile: Of bloodie wars, and die the death, or giue the foe the foyle. And treble blessed had they been, if fortune so had willed: That they with hawtie sword in hand had died in open field. For fame with garland of renowne vndoubted decks his hed: That in defence of Prince and Realme, his life and bloud doth shed. But out (alas) these gallant imps before they came to land: To shew their force and forward harts, by dint of deadly hand. Before they fought amid the field, or lookt the foe in face: With sodain storme in Irish streame were drownd, a wofull case. Up rose with rage a tempest huge, that troubled so the surge, As shipmen shrunke, and Pylot knew not how to scape the scourge. And yet no dread of doubtfull death, no force of fretting fome: Nor wrath of weltring waues could stay, those martiall mates at home. Not angry Aeols churlish chaffe, that scoules amid the skies: Nor sullen Neptunes surging suds mought daunt their manly eyes. Unworthy they (O gods) to feed the hungry fish in flood: Or die so base a death as that, if you had thought it good. But what you will, of force befals, your heauenly power is such, That where and how, and whom you lift, your godheds daily tuch. And reason good, that sithence all by you was wrought and done: No earthly wight should haue the wit your wreakefull scourge to shonne. Well, Sydhnam, Bampfield, and the rest, sith wailing doth no good: Nor that my teares can pay the price or ransome of your blood. Sith no deuise of man can make that you should liue againe: Let these my plaints in verse suffise your soules, accept my paine. If ought my writing be of power to make your vertues known: According to your due deserts which you in life haue shown. Assure your selues, my mournfull Muse shall do the best it can: To cause your names and noble minds, to liue in mouth of man. And so adue, my faithfull friends, lamenting lets my quill: I loued you liuing, and in death, for euer so I will. Accept my writing in good worth, no fitter means I find To do you good, now being dead, nor ease my mourning mind. No better life than you haue led vnto my selfe I wish: But happier death, if I might chuse, than so to feed the fish. The gods allow my lims a tombe and graue wherein to lye: That men may say, thrise happy he, that happened so to die. For kindly death is counted good, and blessed they be thought: That of their friends vnto the pit, vpon the beere are brought. But for my selfe, I reckon those more blest a thousand fold, That in the quarel of their prince, their liues and blood haue sold. As you mine ancient mates did meane, for which the mightie Ioue: In heauen shal place your souls, although your bones on rocks do roue. A letter begun to a Gentlewoman of some account, which was left of by means of the aduise of a friend of his, who said she was foresped. Your beautie (madame) made mine eye to like your face: And now my hart did cause my hand, to sue to you for grace. The ground of my good wit, by feature first was cast, Which your good noble nature hath for euer sealed fast. When plants be surely pight, than lightly will they proue, No tree can take so deep a roote as grifts of faithfull loue. If I had feared disdaine, or thought that hawtie pride Had harbourd in that brest of yours, which is the pecocks guide. Then should I not haue durst these verses to indite, But waying well your curteous kind, I tooke the hart to write. In hope that Uenus gifts are matcht with Pallas goods, And that true frendship floures wil spring of blasing beauties buds. For seldom shal you find a dame of your degree: And of such features, but hir lookes and maners do agree. Which if in proofe I find, as I presume I shall, Then happy others, but I compt my fortune best of all. And to expresse my ioy, my hands I mean to clap: As who would say, loe I am he that haue this blessed hap. Let not my hopes be vaine, in your hand lies my life: And if you list to cut my throte, you haue the fatall knife. For wholy on your lookes and mercy stayes the threed That holds my lims togither now, the gods haue so decreed. I am your bounden thrall, and euer mean to be: I will not change my choice, &amp;c. To his friend not to change, though iealousie debarre him hir company. Change not thy choyce (my deere.) stand stable in good will, Let ancient faithful loue appeere betwixt vs louers still. A wisdom friends to win, as great a wit againe: A gotten friend, that faithfull is, in friendship to retaine. Thou seest how hatred hewes the chips of our mischance: And iealousie doth what it may, the Uiper to aduance. Whose prying eyes are prest to hinder our intent, But malice oft doth misse his marke, where two good wils be bent. So carefull Argus kept the faire well featured cowe: Whose watchful eies ful seldome slept, according to his vowe. And yet at length he lost his head, and eke his hire: For Mercury his cunning crost, to further Ioues desire. So curst Acrisius closde the mayden in the mewe Where he assuredly supposed to keepe the virgin true. Yet Danae did conceaue within the secret towre: And did in lap receiue the god, that fel in golden showre. Way what good wil he heares, that liues in such distrust: He fares as doth the wretch that feares his golde, and lets it rust. Whose hungry heaping minde for all his looking on: Is oft abusde, and made as blinde as any marble stone. I craue but your consent, when time and place agree: And that you wil be wel content to yelde your selfe to me. Who euer wil regard, the honor of your name: And looke what pleasure may be sparde, wil only craue the same. No checke shall taint your cheeke, by proofe of open acte: I neuer wil vnwisely seeke, to haue your credit crackte. My loue excels his lust. my fancy his good wil: My trueth doth farre surmount his trust my good deserts his il. Wherfore (my deare) consent vnto my iust request: For I long sith haue loued you wel, and euer meant you best. So shal you haue my heart, ful redy at your call: You cannot play a wiser part then cherish such a thrall. To his frend not to forget him. Where liking growes of lust, it cannot long endure: But where we finde it graft on loue, there frendships force is sure. Where wealth procures good wil, when substance slides away There fancy alters all by fittes, and true loue doth decay. Where beutie bindes the band, and feature forceth loue. With crooked age or changed face, there frendship doth remoue. No one of these (my deare) that fickle thus doe fade: Did bend my brest, or forst thy frend to follow Cupids trade, But meere good wil in deede not graft on hope of gaine: I lovde without regard of lust as proofe hath taught you plaine. I way no wauering wealth I force not of thy face: No graunt of pleasure prickes me on thy person to embrace. No hope of after hap, ingenders my good wil: I lovde thee when I saw thee first, and so I loue thee stil Wherfore requite with care the man that meanes you so: It lies in you to yeld him ease, or plague his hart with woe. You were not bred of rockes, no marble was your meate: I trust I shal so good a dame, to loue me best intreate. You know I beare the blame, your selfe are nothing free: He loues me not for louing you, nor you for louing me. Consider of the case and like where you are lovde: It is against your kinde to please where you are so reprovde, His frendship is in doubt, you stand assured of me: He hates vs both, I cannot loue, the man that hateth thee. His frantike words of late, bewraide his folly plaine: Assure your selfe he loues you not, his glosing is for gaine. Which purpose being brought, to his desired passe: The sotte wil shew himselfe a beast, and prooue a wayward Asse. By reason rule his rage, by wisdome master wil: Embrace your frend in spite of him, that meanes you no good wil. A time in time may come, if gods wil haue it so: When we each other shal inioy, to quite each others woe. Which time if time agree, to pleasure vs withall: Our honie wil the sweeter seeme that we haue tasted gall. Till when vse womans wit therein you know my minde: I neuer was, nor neuer wil be found your frend vnkinde. A vowe of Constancie. First shal the raging flouds against their course runne: By day the moone shal lend her light, by night the golden sunne. First fickle fortune shall stand at a stedy stay: And in the sea the shining starres shal moue and keepe their way. First Fish amid the ayre, shal wander to and fro: The cloudes be cleere in beuty eke the cole exceede the snowe. First kinde shal alter all and change her wonted state: The blind shal see, the deafe shal heare, the dumbe shal freely prate. Before that any chaunce, or let that may arise Shalbe of force to wrest my loue or quench in any wise. The flame of my good will, and faithful fancies fire: Saue cruel death shal nothing daunt, or coole my hote desire, Desire that guides my life and yeldes my hart his foode: Wherfore to be in presence stil, with thee, would doe me good Which presence I presume thou neuer wilt deny: But as occasion serues, so thou to frendship wilt apply. Til when I giue thee vp, to good and happy chaunce: In hope that time to our delights, wil seeke vs to aduance. Adue (deere frend) to thee, that art my only ioy: More faire to me then Helen was to Priams sonne of Troy. And constant more in loue, then was Vlisses make Of whose assured life and zeale, so much the Poets spake, Lesse light then Lucrece eke whom Tarquins lust defilde: As curteous as the Carthage Queene, that fowly was beguilde. To quite all which good parts, this vow I make to thee: I will be thine as long as I haue power mine owne to be. Another Epitaph vpon the death of Henry Sydhnam, and Gyles Bampfield gent. [1] Yf teares might ought auayle to stynt my woe If sobbyng sighes breathd out from pensiue brest Could ease the gryping greefes that payn me so Or pleasure them for vvhom I am distrest Neyther vvould I stycke vvyth teares to fret my face: Nor spare to spend redoubled sighes apace. 2 But sith neyther dreary drops nor sighes haue power To doe me good, or stand my frends in steede Why should I seeke vvyth sorovves to deuoure Those humors that my fayntyng lymmes should feede. Bootelesse it vvere therfore I vvyl assay To shevv my selfe a frend some other vvay. 3 Some other vvay, as by my mournyng pen, To doe the vvorld to vvit vvhat vvyghts they vvere Whose deaths I vvayle, vvhat frendly forvvard men And to thys land they both dyd beare Alas, I rue to name them in my verse: Whose only thought my trembling hart doth pearse. 4 But yet I must of force their names vnfolde, (For things concealde are seldome when bewaild, Tone Sydnham was, a manly wight and bolde. In whom neither courage haute, nor feature faylde, Faythful to frends vndaunted to his foes A lambe in loue, where he to fancy chose. 5 The second neere vnto my selfe allyde, Gyles Bamfield hight. (I weepe to wryte his name,) A gallant ympe, amyd his youthfull pryde: Whose seemely shape commended natures frame. Deckte of the gods in cradle where he lay: With louely lymmes and parts of purest clay. 6 Themselues might boast theyr byrths for gentle bloud The houses are of countenance whence they came And vaunt I dare their vertues rare as good, As was their race and fitted to the same. There wanted nought to make them perfect blest: Saue happy deathes which clouded all the rest. 7 When rascall Irysh hapned to rebel, (Who sold we see doe long continue true) Unto the Lord of Essex lotte it fell. To haue the lotte those outlawes to subdue. Who went away to please the Prynce and state: A treaded on of many a doughty mate. 8 Whose names although my dreary quil conceale, Yet they (I trust) wil take it wel in worth For noble mindes employd to common weale, Shall finde a stemme to blaze their prowes foorth. My dolefull muse but this alone entends: To wryte and wayle my frends vnhappy endes. 9 Away they would, and gaue their last adew, With burning hearts to slay the sauage foe, Bestride their steads, and to the sea they flew, When weather rose, and water raged so, As they (alas) who meant their countrey good, Were forst to lose their liues in Irish flood. 10 Those eyes should haue lookt the foe in face, Were then constraind to winke at euery waue, Those valiant armes the billowes did imbrace, That vowd with sword this realms renowne to saue: Those manly minds that dreaded no mishap, Were soust in seas, and caught in suddaine trap. 11 Proud Eole Prince controller of the winds, With churlish Neptune, soueraigne of the seas, Did play their parts, and shewd their stubburn kinds, Whom no request nor prayer might appease, The Tooyan Duke bid not so great a brunt, When he of yore for Laume land did hunt. 12 And yet these wights committed none offence, To Iuno, as sir Paris did of yore, Their only trauell was for our defence, Which makes me waile their sodain deaths the more But what the Gods did purpose to be done. By proofe we see, mans wisdom cannot shun. 13 Ye water Nimphes, and you that Ladies be, Of more remorse, and of a milder mood: Than Neptune or king Eole, if you see Their balefull bodies driuing on the floud, Take vp their lims, allowing them a graue, Who well deserued a richer hearse to haue. 14 Whereon do stampe this small deuice in stone, That passers by, may read with dewed eyes, When they by chance shall chance to light thereon. Loe Sydhnam here, and Bampfields body lies: Whose willing harts to serue their prince and realme, Shortned their liues amid this wrathfull streame. Ante obitum supremáque funera fœlix. Deo iubente, fato cedunt mortalia. A louer deceiued, exclaimes against the deceiuer and hir kind. How much a wretch is he that doth affie so well In womans words, and in hir hart doth lodge his loue to dwell? Beleeues hir outward glee, and fickle termes to trust, And doth without regard of time, apply to womans lust? Sith that hir wandring will, and most vnstable mind: Doth daily tosse and turne about, as leaues amid the wind. Who lothes hir most, she loues, and him that sues for grace, She sharply shuns, and proudly scornes, and ebbes and flowes apace. O gods what haue I done? alas, at length I spie: My former follies, and discerne how much I marcht awry. To plant assured trust, in tickle womans brest: That Tygerlike sance mercy liues, and euer shuns the best. And yet she knowes I loue, and how I waste away: And that my hart may haue no rest, nor quiet night or day. Which sith to hir is knowen, and how I hold hir chiefe: Why cruell and vnkind, doth she not pitie of my griefe? Who is so perfect wise, that may such malice brooke, Of womans proud disdaine, or beare their braules with quiet looke? Without an open shew of lothsome lurking smart: That racks the ribs, that beates the brest, and plagues the pensiue hart. O me vnhappy wight, most wofull wretch of all, How do I lose my libertie, and yeeld my selfe a thrall. In seruing hir, that cleane against all law and right: Consumes my life, destroyes my days, and robs my reason quite. O loue, cut off hir course, and bridle such a dame: As skornes thy skill, and leaues thy laws, and makes my griefe hir game. If (as I deeme) thou be, the soueraigne of the skies: Of Elements and Nature eke, that all in order ties. Wreake both thy wrong sustaind, and eke thy damage done To me, on hir, whom flatly thou, perceiuest vs both to shun. Conuert hir frosen hart, to coles of scalding fire Where rigor raigns, and enuie dwels, with poisoned wrathfull ire. She, cruell, knowes my loue, and how as Saint, I shrine Hir beautie in my brest, and how with pearcing pains I pine: And how a thousand times, each day I die, she knowes, Yet mercilesse, no mercy she, nor signe of sorow showes. She bound me to the stake, to broile amid the brands: At point to die a Martyrs death, all which she understands. Yea, though she know it well, yet she conceiues a ioy: At all my bitter grief, and glads hir selfe with mine annoy. O most disloyall dame, O bloudy brested wight: O thou, that hast consumd by care, my hart and courage quite. O thou for treason that Iugurtha, and the Iew Doest far excell, and from thy friend, withholdst thy fauour dew. O traiterous of thy troth, of all good nature bare: Loe here of my poore wounded hart, the gash cut in by care. I see thou seest my sore, and yet thou wilt be blind: Thou stopst thine eares, and wilt not hear the griefs that I do find. Where is become thy loue, and ancient great good will: That earst was borne? wheres that desire that forst thee to fulfill Thy pleasures past with me in cabbin where we lay? What is become of those delights? where is that sugred play? Wheres all that daliance now, and profers proudly made? Wheres those imbrasings friendly, where is that blessed trade And signs of perfit loue, which then thou putst in vre? And which for any gift of mine, mought yet right well endure. Full shadowlike they shift, and can no longer bide: Like dust before the wind they flie, your other mate doth guide. And strikes so great a stroke, he wrests your wits as round As flittering leaues, that from the Ashe or pine are shaken downe. Full lightly womans loue, is altred euermore: It may not last, there is exchange continually in store. And reason: For by kind a woman is but light, Which makes that fansie from hir brest, is apt to take hir flight. I had good hope at first, when hap did me assure, To like of thee, that this thy loue, was planted to endure. I neuer feard a fall, on ground that lay so greene: Where path was plaine for me to passe, and bottom to be seene. I doubted no decay, nor feard no after smart: Thy beautie did me not despaire, thy lookes assured thy hart. But who beleeues the lookes of any of your race, May soone deceiue himselfe, There lies no credite in the face. Well, sith thy froward mind, doth like to heare my mone: And mine vnhappy planet giues consent, that I alone, Without thy loue shall liue, and lacke the lampe of light: To cleare mine eies, that far excels all other stars in sight. Unto the hawtie skies, and people here below: I will my griping griefs expresse, and surge of sorowes show. In hope that direfull death, with dreadfull dart of force: Will couch my carcase in the graue, and there conuey my corse. Yet ere I die, receiue this Swan-like song, To ease my hart, and shew thine open wrong. O wauering womans will, that bends so soone about: Why doest thou so reuolt in hast, and shutst thy friend without. Against the law of loue, O thrise vnhappy hee: That doth beleeue thy beauties beames, and lookes of gallant glee. For neither thraldom long, that I poore wight abode: Nor great good will by sundry signs, and outward gesture shewed. Had force to hold thy hart, and keep thee at a stay: No good desart of mine might stop that would of force away. Yet of this cruel lotte, and fel mischance, I finde Nor know no cause, but that thou art sprong out of womans kind. I iudge that Nature, and the Gods that gouerne all Deuisde this wicked shameles secte to plague the earth withall. A mischiefe for vs men, a burden bad to beare: Without whose match too happy we, and too too blessed were. Euen as the Beares are bread, the Serpent and the Snake. The barking Wolfe, the filthy flie that noysome flesh doth make. The stinking weede to smell that growes among the graine: Euen so I thinke the Gods haue made your race vs men to paine. Why did not kinde foresee and nature so deuise That man of man without the help, of woman mought arise? As by the art of hande of apples apples spring: And as the pearetree graft by kind another peare doeth bring. But if you marke it wel, the cause is quickly seene: It is for that thou Nature art a woman though a Queene. O dames I would not wish you peacocklike to looke Or puft with pride to vaunt that man of you his being tooke. For on the bryar oft a gallant Rose doth grow And of a stincking weede an herbe or floure fresh to shew. Ye are excessiue proude, stuft vp with stately spite: Uoyd of good loue, of loyall trueth and all good counsel quite. Rash, cruel causlesse, curst, vnkinde without desert Borne onely for the scourge of him that beares a faithful hart. I rather wish to die, then liue a vassaile stil Or thrall my selfe vnto a dame that yeldes me no good wil: The wormes shal sooner feede vpon my happy hart: Within my graue, then I for loue of you wil suffer smart. Adue deere dames, the gastly ghostes of hel Shal plague your bones that gloze and loue not wel. To his cruel mistresse. Geue loosers leaue to speake, let him that feeles the smart Without controlment tel his tale, to ease his heauy hart. To thee (proude dame) I poynt, who like the beast of Nile: By teares procurest thy frend to loue and flaiest him all the while. By weeping first to winne and after conquest made To spoyle with spite those yelding impes that follow Cupids trade. Condemnes thy cancred kinde, more glory were for thee To ransacke none but rebel harts and let the rest goe free. Kinde wist not what she wrought when she such beuty lent Unto those gallant limmes of thine to monstrous mischiefe bent. For either fowler face she would haue yelded thee: Or better moode and milder minde to make remorse of me. Thou bearest two burning brands, below those browes of thine: And I the brimstone in my brest, which makes my hart to pine. Eche lowring looke of yours, frets farther in my hart: And nips me neerer then the force of any other dart. And to increase my care, thou makest thy beutie more: An oyle (God wotte) vnto my fire, no salue to ease my sore. If thou a woman were, of ruth and due remorse: Thou wouldst allow me loue, and not so proudly plague my corse. I sue for mercy now, with hands lift vp on hie Which if I misse I am assurde, within fewe dayes to die. And if I may not haue the thing I would enioy: I pray the Gods to plague thee as they did the dame of Troy. I meane that Creside coy that linkt her with a Greeke: And left the lusty Troyan Duke, of all his loue to seeke. And so they wil I trust a mirror make of thee: That beuties darlings may beware when they thy scourge shal see. I neuer meant thee wel, in all my life before: But now to plague thy foule abuse, I hate thee ten times more. For reason willes me so, my frends to loue and serue And cruel Ladies like thy selfe, to wish as they deserue. Hencefoorth if any limme, of mine perhap rebel: And thee whom I of right should loth doe loue or fancie wel. I quite renounce the same he shall no more be mine To vse or stand in stead, then I doe purpose to be thine. And thus I make an end of loue, and lines at once The frounce consume the flesh of her, that feedes vpon my bones. The Author being in Moscouia, wrytes to certaine his frendes in Englande of the state of the place, not exactly, but at all aduentures, and minding to haue descrybed all the Moscouites maners, brake off his purpose vpon some occasion. The three Epistles followe. To his especiall frende, master Edwarde Dancie. My Dancie deere, when I recount within my brest: My London frends and wonted mates and thee aboue the rest. I feele a thousand fittes of deepe and deadly woe: To thinke that I from sea to land, from blisse to bale did goe. I left my natiue soyle, ful like a retchlesse man And vnacquainted of the coast, among the Russies ranne. A people passing rude, to vices vile enclinde: Folke fitte to be of Bacchus traine, so quaffing is their kinde. Drinke is their whole desire, the pot is all their pride: The sobrest head doeth once a day, stand needeful of a guyde. If he to banquet bid his frends, he wil not shrinke On them at dinner to bestow a dosen kindes of drinke. Such licour as they haue and as the countrey giues: But cheefly two, one called Kuas, whereby the Musick liues. Small ware and waterlike but somewhat tart in taste: The rest is Meade, of hony made wherewith their lips they baste. And if he goe vnto his neighbour as a guest: He cares for litle meate, if so his drinke be of the best. Perhaps the Mausick hath a gay and gallant wife: To serue his beastly lust yet he will leade a bowgards life. The monster more desires a boy within his bed Then any wench, such filthy sinne ensues a drunken head. The woman to repay, her drousie husbands dettes: From stinking stoue vnto her mate to baudy banquet gets. No wonder though they vse such vile and beastly trade: Sith with the hatchet and the hand, their chiefest Gods be made. Their Idolles haue their hearts on God they neuer call: Unlesse it be (Nichola Bough) that hangs against the wall. The house that hath no God, or painted saint within: Is not to be resorted to, that roofe is full of sinne. Besides their priuate Gods, in open places stand Their crosses, vnto which they crouch, and blesse themselues with hand. Deuoutly downe they ducke, with forhead to the ground: Was neuer more deceit in ragges, and greasie garments found. Almost the meanest man in all the countrey rides: The woman eke against our vse, her trotting horse bestrides. In sundry colors they both men and women go: In buskins all, that money haue on buskins to bestow. Eche woman hanging hath a ring within hir eare: Which all of ancieut vse, and some of very pride do weare. Their gate is very graue, their countenance wise and sad: And yet they follow fleshly lusts, their trade of liuing bad. It is no shame at all, accounted to defile Anothers bed, they make no care their follies to concile. Is not the meanest man in all the land, but he To buy hir painted colours doth allow his wife a fee. Wherewith she decks hir selfe, and dies hir tawnie skin: She prancks and paints hir smokie face, both browe, lip, cheeke and chin. Yea those that honest are (if any such there vee) Within the land, do vse the like, a man may plainly see. Upon some womens cheekes the painting how it lies: In plaster sort, for that too thicke hir face the harlot dies. But such as skilfull are, and cunning dames in deed: By daily practise do it well, yea sure they do exceed. They lay their colours so, as he that is full wise: May easily be deceiued therein, if he do trust his eies. I not a little muse what madnesse makes them paint Their faces, waying how they keepe the stoue by meere constraint. For seldom when, vnlesse on church or mariage day. A man shall see the dames abrode that are of vest aray. The Russie means to reape the profit of hir pride: And so he mewes hir, to be sure she lie by no mans side. Thus much (friend Dancie) I did meane to write to thee: To let thee wite, in Russia land, what men and women bee. Hereafter I perhaps of other things will write: To thee and other of my friends, which I shall see with sight. And other stuffe besides, which true report shall tell: Meane while I end my louing lines, and bid thee now farewell. To Spencer. If I should now forget or not remember thee: Thou (Spencer) mightst a foule rebuke and shame impute to mee. For I to open shew did loue thee passing well: And thou were he, at parture whom I loathd to bid farewell. And as I went thy friend, so I continue still: No better proofe thou canst desire than this, of true good will. I do remember well when needs I should away: And that the preast would licence vs, no longer time to stay. Thou wroongst me by the fist, and holding fast my hand: Didst craue of me to send thee newes, and how I likte the land. It is a sandie soyle, no very fruitfull vaine: More wast and wooddie grounds there are than closes fit for graine. Yet graine there growing is, which they vntimely take: And cut or ere the corne be ripe, they mowe it on a stake. And laying sheafe by sheafe, their haruest so they drie: They make the greater hast. for feare the frost the corne destrie. For in the winter time, so glarie is the ground: As neither grasse nor other graine in pastures may be found. In comes the cattell then, the sheepe, the colt, the cowe: Fast by his bed the Mowsicke then a lodging doth alowe. Whom he with fodder feeds, and holds as deare as life: And thus they weare the Winter with the Mowsicke and his wife. Eight monthes the Winter dures, the glare it is so great: As it is May before he turne his ground to sowe his wheate. The bodies eke that die, vnburied lie till then: Laid vp in coffins made of firre, as well the poorest men. As those of greater state, the cause is lightly found: For that in winter time they cannot come to breake the ground. And wood so plenteous is quite throughout all the land: As rich and poore at time of death, assured of coffins stand. Perhaps thou musest much, how this may stand with reason: That bodies dead, can vncorrupt, abide so long a season. Take this for certaine troth, as soone as heate is gone: The force of cold the body bindes as hard as any stone. Without offence at all, to any liuing thing: And so they lie in perfit state, till next returne of spring. Their beasts be like to ours, as far as I can see: For shape and show, but somwhat lesse of bulke and bone they bee. Of watrith taste, the flesh not firme, like English biefe: And yet it serues them very well, and is a good reliefe. Their sheep are very small, sharpe singled, handfull long: Great store of fowle on sea and land, the moorish reeds among. The greatnes of the store doth make the prices lesse: Besides, in all the land they know not how good meat to dresse. They vse neither broach nor spit, but when the stoue they heat, They put their vitails in a pan, and so they bake their meat. No pewter to be had, no dishes but of wood: No vse of trenchers, cups cut out of birch are very good. They vse but woodden spoones, which hanging in a case: Each Mowsike at his girdle ties, and thinks it no disgrace. With whittles two or three, the better man the mo. The chiefest Russies in the land, with spone and kniues do go. Their houses are not huge of building, but they say They plant them in the loftiest ground to shift the snow away. Which in the Winter time eche where full thicke doth lie: Which makes them haue the more desire to set their houses hie. No stone worke is in vse, their roofes of rafters bee: One linked in another fast, their wals are all of tree. Of mastes both long and large, with mosse put in betweene, To keep the force of weather out, I neuer earst haue seene. A grosse deuise so good, and on the roofe they lay: The burthen barke, to rid the raine and sudden showres away. In euery roome a (stoue) to serue the winter turne: Of wood they haue suffising store, as much as they can burne. They haue no English glasse, of slices of a rocke: Hight Sluda, they their windowes make, that English glasse doth mocke. They cut it very thin, and sowe it with a threed, In pretie order like to panes, to serue their present need. No other glasse good faith doth giue a better light: And sure the rocke is nothing rich, the cost is very slight. The chiefest place is that where hangs the God by it: The owner of the house himselfe, doth neuer vse to sit. Unlesse his better come, to whom he yeelds the seat: The stranger bending to the god, the ground with browe must beat. And in that very place, which they most sacred deeme: The stranger lies a token that his guest he doth esteeme. Where he is woont to haue a Beares skin for his bed: And must in stead of pillow clap his saddle to his hed. In Russia other shift there is not to be had: For where the bedding is not good, the bolsters are but bad. I mused very much what made them so to lie Sith in their countrey downe is rife, and feathers out of cry. Unlesse it be because the countrey is so hard: They feare by nicenes of a bed, their bodies would be marde. I wisht thee oft with vs, saue that I stoode in feare Thou wouldst haue loathed to haue layd, thy limmes vpon a beare As I and Stafford did, that was my make in bed: And yet we thanke the God of heauen, we both right wel haue sped. Loe thus I make an end, none other newes to thee: But that the countrey is too colde the people beastly be. I write not all I know, I touch but here and there For if I should, my pen would pinch, and eke offend I feare. Who so shal reade this verse, coniecture of the rest: And thinke by reason of our trade that I doe thinke the best. But if no traffick were, then could I boldly pen The hardnes of the soyle, and eke the manners of the men. They say the Lyons pawe geues iudgement of the beast: And so may you deeme of the great by reading of the least. To Parker. My Parker, paper, pen and inke were made to write, And idle heads that litle doe, haue leysure to endite Wherfore respecting these, and thine assured loue, If I would write no newes to thee thou mightst my pen reprooue. And sithens fortune thus, hath shoued my ship from shore: And made me seeke another Realme vnseene of me before. The manners of the men, I purpose to declare And other priuate points beside, which strange and geason are. The Russie men are round of bodies, fully fast The greatest part with bellies big, that ouerhang the wast. Flat headed for the most, with faces nothing faire. But browne by reason of the stoue, and closenes of the ayre. It is their common vse, to shaue or els to sheare, Their heads: for none in all the land, long lolling lockes doe weare. Unles perhaps he haue his soueraigne Prince displeasde For then he neuer cuts his heare, vntil he be appeasde. A certaine signe to know who in displeasure be: For euery man that vewes his head wil say, loe this is he. And during all the time, he lets his locks to grow: Dares no man for his life, to him a face of frendship show. Their garments be not gay, nor handsome to the eye: A cap aloft their heads they haue that standeth very hie. Which (Colpack) they doe tearme they weare no ruffes at al The best haue collars set with pearle Rubasca they doe call. Their shirts in Russie long they worke them downe before And on the sleeues with coloured silkes, two ynches good or more. Aloft their shirts they weare a garment iocket wise Hight Onoriadka, and about his bourly wast he ties His Portkies, which in stead, of better breeches be. Of linnen cloth that garment is no codpeece is to see A paire of yornen stockes to keepe the cold away: Within his bootes the Russie weares, the heeles they vnderlay. With clouting clamps of steele, sharpe pointed at the toes: And ouer all a Suba furde, and thus the Russie goes. Wel butned is the Sube according to his state Some silke, of siluer other some but those of poorest rate Doe weare no Subes at all but grosser gownes to sight: That reacheth downe beneath the calfe, and that Armacha hight. These are the Russies robes, the richest vse to ride From place to place, his seruant runnes and followes by his side. The Cassocke beares his fealt, to force away the raine: Their bridles are not very braue, their saddles are but plaine. No bittes, but snaffels all, of bryche their saddles be: Much fashioned like the Scottish seates, broad flaxs to keepe the knee. From sweating of the horse, the pannels larger farre And broader be than ours they vse short stirrops for the warre, For when the Russie is pursude by cruel foe He rides away, and sodenly, betakes him to his bowe. And bendes me but about in saddle as he sits And therewithall amid his race, his following foe he hittes. Their bowes are very short, like Turky bowes outright: Of sinewes made with byrthen barke, in cunning maner dight. Small arrowes, cruel heads, that fel and forked be: Which being shot from out those bowes a cruel wayes wil flee. They seldome shooe their horse, vnlesse they vse to ride In poast vpon the frozen floode, then cause they shal not slide He sets a slender calke, and so he rides his way: The horses of the countrey goe, good fourescore veorsts a day And all without the spurre once prick them and they skip, But goe not forward on their way. the Russie hath his whip To rap him on the ribs for though all booted be Yet shal you not a paire of spurs in all the countrey see, The common game is chesse almost the simplest wil Both geue a checke and eke a mate, by practise comes their skil. Againe the dice as fast, the poorest roges of all Wil sit them downe in open field and there to gaming fall. Their dice are very small, in fashion like to those Which we doe vse, he takes them vp, and ouer thumbe he throwes, Not shaking them a whit, they cast suspiciously: And yet I deeme them voyd of arte, that dicing most apply. At plaxe when siluer lackes, goes saddle, horse and all: And each thing els worth siluer walkes, although the price be small. Because thou louest to play, frend Parker, other while I wish thee there, the weary day, with dicing to beguile. But thou were better farre at home, I wist it wel And wouldst been loath among such loutes so long a time to dwel. Then iudge of vs thy frends, what kind of life we had. That neere the frozen pole to wast our weary dayes were glad. In such a sauage soyle, where lawes doe beare no sway But all is at the King his wil, to saue or els to stay. And that saunce cause God wot, if so his minde be such But what meane I with kings to deale we ought no Saints to touch. Conceaue the rest your selfe, and deeme what liues they leave: Where lust is law, and subiectes liue continually in dread. And where the best estates, haue none assurance good Of lands, of liues, nor nothing falles vnto the next of bloud. But all of custome doeth vnto the Prince redowne: And all the whole reuenue comes vnto the king his crowne, Good faith I see thee muse, at what I tel thee now But true it is, no choyce but all at Princes pleasure bowe. So Tarquine ruled Rome, as thou remembrest well: And what his fortune was at last, I know thy selfe canst tell. Where will in common weale, doth beare the onely sway. And lust is law, the prince and realme must needs in time decay. The strangenesse of the place is such for sundry things I see: As if I would, I cannot write such priuate point to thee. The cold is rare, the people rude, the prince so full of pride: The realm so stord with monks &amp; nunnes, and priests on euery side. The maners are so Turkylike, the men so full of guile: The women wanton, temples stuft with idols that defile. The seats that sacred ought to be, the customs are so quaint: As if I would describe the whole, I feare my pen would faint. In summe I say, I neuer saw a prince that so did raigne: Nor people so beset with Saints, yet all but vile and vaine. Wild Irish are as ciuil as the Russies in their kind: Hard choice which is the best of both, each bloodie rude, and blind. If thou be wise, as wise thou art, and wilt be rulde by mee: Liue still at home, and couet not, those barbarous coasts to see. No good befals a man that seekes, and finds no better place: No ciuil customs to be learnd, where God bestowes no grace. And truly ill they do deserue, to be beloued of God: That neither loue, nor stand in awe of his assured rod. Which (thogh be long) yet plagues at last the vile and beastly sort Of sinfull wights, that all in vice do place their chiefest sport. Adieu friend Parker, if thou list, to know the Russies well: To Sigismundus booke repaire, who all the truth can tell. For he long earst in message went, vnto that sauage king: Sent by the Pole, and true report in each respect did bring. To him I recommend my selfe, to ease my pen of paine: And now at last do wish thee well, and bid farewell againe. To his friend Nicholas Roscarock, to induce him to take a wife. Roscarocke, sith my raging prime is past, And riper age with reasons learned lore, Well staied hath my wits that went so fast, And coold the heat that hent my brest of yore: I cannot choose but write some solemne stuffe, For thee to read, when thou art in thy ruffe. I see thee muse what should the matter be, Whereof I meane to treate, thou bitest thy lip, And bendst thy browe as though I were not he That had a tricke my Cornish friend to trip: Well, to be short, it toucheth mariage vow, An order which my selfe haue entred now. A sacred yoke, a state of mickle praise, A blessed band, belikt of God and man, And such a life, as if in former dayes I had but knowen, as now commend I can, Good faith I would not wasted so my prime, In wanton wise, and spent an idle time. An idle time, as sundry gallants vse, I meane my London mates, that tread the streete, And golden wits with fond conceits abuse, And base deuises farre for such vnmeet. Leauing the law, and casting bookes aside, Wherby in time you mought your countries guide. Your daily practise is to beat the bush, Where beauties birds do lodge themselues to lie: You shoote at shapes and faces deare a rush, And bend your bowes, your feeble strengths to trie. Of closure you somtimes do common make, And where you lift, abroad your pleasures take. You count it but a game to graffe the horne That inward growes, and seldom shewes without: The silly man you skoffe and laugh to skorne, And for his pacience deeme him but a lout. By day you gaze vpon your Ladies lookes, By night you gad to hang your baited hookes. Thus do you lauish frolike youth away, With idle words not woorth a parched pease, And like to wanton colts that run astray, You leape the pale, and into euery lease. Where fitter far it were to marry wiues, And well disposd to lead more sober liues. Reuolt in tyme, least time repentance bring, Let each enioy his lawfull wedded mate, Or else be sure, your selues in time shall sing The selfesame note, and rue your harmes too late. For commonly the wrong that we entend, Lights on our heads and shoulders in the end. Perhaps thou wouldst as willing wedded be, As I my selfe and many other moe: But that thou canst no perfit beautie see, For which thou wilt thy single life forgoe. Both yoong &amp; faire, with wealth &amp; goods thou seekst, Such one she is, whom thou Roscarocke leekst. Be rulde by me, let giddy fansie go, Imbrace a wife, with wealth and coyne enough: Force not the face, regard not feature so, An aged grandame that maintains the plough. And brings thee bags, is woorth a thousand peates, That pranck their pates &amp; liue by Spanish meates. That one contents hir self with now and than, Right glad if she might sit at Uenus messe Once in the moneth, the youthfull Damsell can Not so be pleasd, hir rage must haue redresse, As oft as pleasure pricks hir lims to lust, Els all the matter lies amid the dust. Wherfore I iudge the best and wisest way Were wife to wed, and leaue to range at will, In maried life there is assured stay, Where otherwise to follow euery Gill, Breeds wracke of wealth, of credit, ease, and blisse, And makes men run their races quite amisse. Experto credere tutum est. A gentlewomans excuse for executing vnlawfull partes of loue. Earst Sylla tooke no shame, for Minos sake Hir father Nysus purple pate to sheare, Medea for the loue of Iason brake The bands of kind, and slew hir brother deare, Forwent hir worthy Sire, and kingly crowne, And followed him the rouer vp and downe. For Theseus when in Labirinth he lay In dread of death, the monster was so nie, Faire Ariadna did deuise a way To saue his life, vnlesse that Ouid lie, And yet the beast, hir brother was in deed, (Whom Theseus slue) and sprang of Minos seed. At siege of Troy whilest Agamemnon fought, Aegistheus wan Queene Clitemnestras hart, So as when he returnd and little thought Of death, this dame began to play hir part, She slew the prince to folow former lust, And thought the fact to be exceeding iust. Faire Phyllis slew hir selfe, vnhappy dame Through loue: and did not Dydo do the like For Prince Aeneas who to Carthage came, When he was forst, by showres the shore to seeke? What more vnkindly parts can man deuise, Than Queens for loue their honors to despise? Now iudge my case, my fault vprightly scan, Deeme my desart, by this it may be gest, I am by nature made to loue a man, As Sylla, Phyllis, Dido, and the rest, If they and I haue done amisse for loue, Let kind be blamd, that thereunto did mooue. The wisest men as farre as I can see, Haue been entbrald through loue as well as we. Amor vince ogni cosa. Of his Constancie. We way not waxe, for all his gallant hew, Bicause it vades and melts against the fire, We more regard a rocke of marble blew, For that no force doth cause it to retire, The builder makes his full account, that it duff. Will firmly stand at a stay, and neuer flit. So may you (sweete) be sure, that my good will Is no good will of waxe, to waste away, When fond desire of fansie hath his fill, My loue is like the marble for his stay, Build thereupon, and you shall surely find, No blast of chance to change my stedfast mind. Blacke shall you see the snow on mountains hie, The fish shall feed vpon the barren sand. The sea shal shrinke, and leaue the Dolphins dry, No plant shall prooue vpon the sencelesse land, The Tems shal turne, the Sunne shal lose his light Ere I to thee become a faithlesse wight. I neither am nor meane to bee, None other than I seeme to thee. The Authors Epilogue. Lo here the end of all my worke, behold the threed I drew Is wrought to cloth, accomplisht now, you see this slender clew. A peece (God wot) of little price, scarce woorth the Readers paine: And in mine owne conceit a booke of barren verse and vaine. I blush to let it out at large for Sages to peruse: For that the common custome is, in bookes to gape for newes. And matter of importance great which either may delite By pleasure, or with sad aduise the readers paynes requite. But this of mine so maymed is, for lacke of learned stile And stately stuffe, as sure I shall the readers hope beguile. Who doth expect some rare report, of former ancient deedes: Or new deuice but lately wrought, that breatheth yet and bleedes. But truely none of both in these, my verses is to finde: My slender ship hath kept the shore, for feare of boystrous winde. I bore my simple sayles but lowe I dreaded sodaine showers: Which sundry times from hauty skies, the puisant ruler powers. I durst not stir amid the streame, the chanel was too deepe: Which made me haue the more regard abaut the bankes to keepe. It is for mighty hulkes to dare, aduenture out so farre: And barkes of biggest sise, and such as builded be for warre. I write but of familiar stuffe, because my stile is lowe: I feare to wade in weighty works, or past my reach to rowe. Which if I should, the Reader might as boldly blame my quil: As now I trust he shal accept, my shew of great good wil. Though diuers write with fuller phrase, and farre more hawty stile: And burnish out their golden bookes with fine and learned file. Yet meaner Muses must not lurke but each in his degree That meaneth wel, and doth his best must wel regarded be. Though Nilus for his bignes beare away the greatest name: Whose seu?fold stream hath gaind y? gulfe of such a lasting fame. Yet must not lesser lakes be lost, nor had in vile account That serue for vse and ease of man though Nilus doe surmount. Great Alexander mighty was and dreadful in the warre: Yet thats no cause why Rome should not of Cæsar boast as farre. The Planets are the pride of heauen, and cheefest lampes of light: Yet other starres doe yelde a shew and helpe to cleere the night. Likewise though diuers write in verse and doe exceeding wel: The remnant must not be refusde, because they doe excell. Ill may we misse the slender shrubs for all the princely Pine: No more we scorne the baser drinkes though most we way the wine. Which makes me hope that though my Muse doth yelde but slender sound: And though my Culter scarcely cuts, or breakes the marble ground. Yet sithens that I meant with verse, to feede the Readers eyes: And to that purpose bent my braines these fancies to deuise. I trust he takes it wel in worth and beares with what he findes. And thereunto the Reader aye the writers trauaile bindes. Which if he doe I haue my hire, who happy then but I? That wrote this worke for grateful men, to vewe with thankfull eye. And so I giue the congee now, with wish that this my booke Be such as may thy sprites delight, that hapnest here to looke. Ill were my fortune if in all this treatise as it standes: There should be nothing worth the vew when so it comes to hand. Roscarockes warrant shal suffise who likte the writing so As did embolden me to let the leaues at large to goe. If il succeede, the blame was his who might haue kept it backe: And frendly tolde me that my booke his due deuise did lacke. But as it is, loe there it goes, for euery one to vew: The man that each ones humor pleasde, as yet I neuer knew. Sufficeth if the courtly sort whose doome is deepe in deede: Accompt it ought, with baser wits I care not how it speede. The courtier knowes what best becomes, in euery kind of case: His nature is, what so he doth to decke with gallant grace, The greatest clarkes in other artes, can hardly doe the leeke: For learning sundry times is there where iudgement is to seeke. The Authors excuse for writing these and other fancies, with promise of grauer matter hereafter. Lordings allow my light and lewde deuise And Ladies ye that are of greatest state Beare with my bookes, imputing nought to vice That I haue pende in youth, nor now of late, My prime prouokt my hasty idle quil: To write of loue, when I did meane no ill. Two things in cheefe did moue me thus to write And made me deeme it none offence at all, First Ouids works bedeckt with deepe delight, Whom we of Poets second best doe call, I found him full of amours euery where: Each leafe of loue the title eke did beare. Then next I liued in place among the moe, Where fond affection bore the cheefest sway, And where the blinded archer with his bow Did glaunce at sundry gallants euery day And being there although my minde were free: Yet must I seeme loue wounded eke to be. I sawe how some did seeke their owne mishap, And hunted dayly to deuoure the hookes, That beuty hayted, and were caught in trap, Like wilfull wights that fed on womens lookes, Who being once entangled in the line, Did yelde themselues and were content to pine. Some other minding least to follow loue, By haunting where dame Uenus darlings dwelt, By force were forst Cupidos coales to prooue. Whose burning br?ds did make their minds to melt So as they were compeld by meere mischaunce, As others did, to follow on the daunce. Some eke there were that groapt but after gaine That faynd to frie and burne with blooming heate Of raging loue and counterfetted paine, When they (God wot) had slender cause to treate, But all was done to make their Ladies deeme How greatly they their beuties did esteeme. And then (O gods) to vew their greeful cheeres, And listen to their fonde lamenting cries, To see their cheekes deepe dented in with teares That day and night powred out from painful eyes, Would make a heart of marble melt for woe, That sawe their plights, &amp; did their sorowes know And all for lacke of ruthe and due remorse Their cruel Ladies bore so hard a hand, And they (poore men) constraynd to loue perforce, And fruitlesse cleane to sowe the barrain sand. That vnto me who priuie was of all, It was a death and grieued me to the gall. Then for my friends (as diuers loued me well) Endite I must some light deuise of loue, And in the same my friends affection tell, Whom nothing mought from beauties bar remooue My pen must plead the sillie Suters case, I had my hire, so he mought purchase grace. Some otherwhile when beautie bred disdaine, And feature forst a pride in hawtie brest, So as my friend whs causelesse put to paine And for good will might purchace slender rest: Then must my quill to quarels flatly fall, Yet keep the meane twixt sweete and sower brall. Somtimes I must comm?d their beauties much That neuer came where any beautie lay, Againe somwhiles my mates would haue me tutch The quicke, bicause they had receiued the nay: And thus my pen, as change of matter grew, Was forst to grief, or els for grace to sue, Thus did I deale for others pleasure long (As who could well refuse to do the like) And for my self somtimes would write among As he that liues with men of war must strike. I would deuise a Sonet to a dame, And all to make my sullen humor game. So long I wrote, so oft my friends did sue So many were the matters, as at last, The whole unto a hansome volume grewe, Then to the presse they must in all the hast, Mauger my beard, my mates would haue it so Whom to resist it was in vaine you know. These causes forst my harmeles hand to write, And no desire I had to treate of ill Who doth not know that youthfull heads delight Sometimes to shewe the queintnes of their quil, But pardon (Lordings) what is past and done I purpose now a better race to runne. I meane no more with loues deuise to deale, I neuer wil to wanton Uenus bowe, From Cupids court to Pallas I appeale, Iuno be iudge whom I doe honor now Hie time it is for him to blow retreate: And leaue to loue whom selfe rod now doth beate. Wherfore, goe (wanton) trusse vp all your trash Fancy farewel, to grauer gods I goe, Then loue and Uenus, cleane my hands I wash, Of vayne desires that youth enrageth so Uertue doth farre surmount such filthy vice Amend my mates, or els you know the price. Vtile consilium est sæuas extinguere flammas, Qui non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit. FINIS.</field>
