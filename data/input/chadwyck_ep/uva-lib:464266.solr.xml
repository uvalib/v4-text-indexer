      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL MAISTER FERDINANDO HEABVRN, GROOME OF HER MAIESTIES PRIVIE CHAMBER. M. Io. Dowland to the Author. Thov only shalt have Phyllis, Only thou fit (without all further gloses) Crouned to be with euerlasting Roses, With Roses and with Lillies, And with Daffadoundillies, But thy songs sweeter are (saue in their closes) Then are Lillies or Roses: Like his that taught the woods sound Amaryllis. GOLDINGS; you that haue too too dainty NOSES, Auaunt, go feede you themels where on ROSES. M. R. Alison in praise of the Author. As Treasure hidde within the golden Myne, Such is the state of Musiques art vnknowne, The ore digde forth the workeman maks it fine, Till which performde the vertue is not showne: So Farnaby had left this worke obscured, And drownd deserte of praise belonging to him, Had he not bin by speciall friends procured, With tycing speech and filed phraise to wooe him: These works had quaild and he from vse had swaru'd, But well performde and therefore well deseru'd. M. Hu. Holland to the Author. I would both sing thy praise, and praise thy singing: That in the winter nowe are both aspringing. But my Muse must be stronger, And the daies must be longer, When the sunne's in his hight with y? bright Barnaby, Then should we sing thy praises gentle Farnaby The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. [4 voices] [I. My Ladyes collor'd cheeks] My Ladies collor'd cheeks, weare like the damaske roses My Ladies collor'd cheeks, weare like the damaske roses, which clad in damaske mantles spred the arbors: but thrise more pleasant weare her sweet supposes, thise more pleasant were her sweet supposes, but supposes, proceeding from her lips, where sweet loue harbors, where for vewing those, for her cheeks &amp; roses sprowting, for vewing those her cheeks and roses sprowting, the iudgm?t of y? sweetest breeds a doubting. [II. Carters now cast down your whips] Caarters, now cast down your whips Caarters, now cast down your whips, Carters, now cast down your whips, your whips, and shepheards put off your scrips, &amp; whilst that your sheep are grazing, behold faire stars blazing, behold, faire stars blazing, Ambrosia talking with Amarillis, and Coridon walking with faire Phillis, and Coridon, Coridon walking with faire Phillis, to set your eyes, your eyes agazing: and Coridon. [III. Philida bewailed the want of Coridon] Philida bewaild the want of Coridon Philida bewaild the want of Coridon, and Herpulus of Philida complained, for Corine often would she sigh and grone, for Corine often would she sigh but Herpulus that lou'd her she disdained, poore Herpulus, why should not rigor moue, not rigor moue thee, to hate her thrice, to to hate her thrice, that once disdaind to loue thee poore. [IV. Daphne on the rainebow] Daphne on the rainebow, riding Daphne on the rainebow, riding, on the rainebow riding, when all the gods weare chiding, were chiding, when all the gods were chiding, were chiding, fell sodenly amazed, full gastly then she gazed and presently the god of anger frownd, and in his fury down he flang her, down he flang her, and in his fury down he flang her, in her down he flang her. [V. Blind loue was shooting] Blind loue was shooting, &amp; losing of his arrow Blind loue was shooting, &amp; losing of his arrow, he kild his mothers sparrow, he and tracing forth his footing, his mother Venus spide it, before the boy could hide it. [VI. Pearce did loue faire Petronel] Pearce did loue faire Petronel Pearce did loue faire Petronel, because she sang &amp; danced well, and danced well, and gallantly could pranck it &amp; he puld her and, he puld her and he hauld her, and oftentimes he cald her, and often times he cald her, primrose pearles, primrose pearles prickt in a blanket. [VII. Pearce did daunce with Petronel] Pearce did daunce with Petronella, Lasiaminan and Laduncella Pearce did daunce with Petronella, Lasiaminan and Laduncella, pretty Almans that weare new, such he daunst and nothing true, but when Parnel daunst without him, without him, all the maids began to floute him, all the maids began to floute him. [VIII. The wauering planet] The wauering planet, the wauering planet, the wauering planet most vnstable The wauering planet, the wauering planet, the wauering planet most vnstable, goddes of the waters flowing, of the waters flowing, that beares a sway in each thing growing, &amp; makes my Lady variable, oft I seeke to vndermind her, oft I seeke to vndermind her, oft I seeke to vndermind her yet I know not where not where, yet I know not where, yet I know not where to find her. [IX. Lady, the sillie flea of all disdained] Lady, the silly flea of all disdained Lady, the silly flea of all disdained, because it hath complained I pitty, I pitty that poore creature, I pitty, I pitty, I pitty y? poore creature, both black &amp; small of stature, were I a flea, in bed, in bed, I would not bite you, I would not bite you, not bite you, but search some other, some other way for to delight you. [X. Thrice blessed be the giuer] Thrice blessed be the giuer Thrice blessed be the giuer, be the giuer, thrice be the giuer, that gaue sweet loue that golden quiuer, and liue he long, and liue he long among the gods anointed, that made the arrow heads, that made the arrow heads sharpe pointed, if either of them both had quailed, had qualed, qualed, she of my loue, she of my loue, of my loue, and I of hers, and I of hers, of hers, had failed. [XI. The curtaine drawne I saw my loue] The curtaine drawn I saw my loue, I saw my loue lie sleeping The curtaine drawn I saw my loue, I saw my loue lie sleeping, thrice happy was that peeping, thrice happy was that peeping, for vewing her sweet lying her sweet, her sweet lying, preserues my life and keeps my soule from dying, and keeps my soule from dying, of thousand ioyes missing her I had mist all, whose sight reuiues me more, reuiues me more, whose whose sight reuiues me more, reuiues me more then ruby, pearle, then ruby, pearle, or cristall. [XII. Susanna faire sometime] Svsanna faire somtime of loue requested Svsanna faire somtime of loue requested, Susanna faire somtime of loue requested, by two old men whom her sweet looks allur'd, was in her hart full sad and sore molested, ful sad and sore molested, seeing the force her chastity endur'd, to them she said, if I by craft procur'd, do yeeld to you my body to abuse it, I loose my soule, and if I shall refuse it, you will me iudge to death reprochfully, but better it is in innocent to chuse it, then by my fault t'offend my God on hye, then by my fault, t'offend my God on hie. [XIII. Loue shooting among many] Loue shooting, loue shooting among many Loue shooting, loue shooting among many, by chance he hit not any, because the shaft, the shaft, rebounded, and loue himselfe was wounded and loue himselfe was wounded, loue himselfe was wounded, when Siches saw the dart had mist her, when Siches saw the dart had mist, had mist, had mist her, when she smild and said that all the gods had blest her, said that all the gods had blest, had blest her. [XIIII. Loue shooting at an other] Loue shooting at another Loue shooting at another, shooting at another, loue, loue shooting at another, he mist that marke, and chanst to hit, and chanst to hit his mother, but as the Lady fainted, god Mars did start, and there with was, and there with was attainted when Vulcan saw the shoot the shoot did freat him, he curst the boy, he curst the boy, and sweare that he would beat him. [XV. Ay me poore hart] Ay me poore hart Ay me poore hart, since loue hath plaied his part, my sences all are lost, my mind eke tost, like waues that swell, sweet god of loue, of loue thou dost excell, thy passions moue, my mind to proue, that turtle doue, she flies, my loue she tries, helpe gods that sit on hie Oh send me remedy, oh send me remedy. [XVI. Sometime she would and sometime not] Somtime she would and somtime not Somtime she would and somtime not, &amp; somtime not, the more request, the more disdaind, the each woman hath her gift god wot and, euer had since Venus raignd, and euer had since Venus raignd, and euer had since Venus raignd, though Vulcan, though Vulcan, though Vulcan, did to Venus yeeld, I would haue men to winne y? field [XVII. Among the dafadillies] Among the Daffadillies Among the Daffadillies, and faire white splendant Lillies, the God of loue, the god of loue came creeping, where Dians nimphs lay sleeping, lay sleeping, he bent his bow, he bent his bow, but mist his footing, mist his footing, and loosing lost, both labor shaft and shooting, he bent his bow, but mist his footing, he bent his bow, but mist his footing, and loosing lost both labor shaft and shooting. [XVIII. Simkin said that Sises was faire] Simkin said that Sis was faire Simkin said that Sis was faire, and that he ment to loue her, he set her on his ambling Maire, all this he did to proue her, all this he did to proue her, all this he did to proue her, when they came home Sis floted cream and pourd it through a strainer, pourd it through a strainer, and pourd it through a strainer, pourd it through a strainer, but sware that Simkin should haue none because he did, he did disdaine her. [XIX. Ladie when 'I behold your passions] Lady, when I behold your passions Lady, when I behold your passions, so diuers and so oft constrained, vpon such slight or no occasions, such slight or no occasions as though you were with griefe sore pained, as though you were with griefe sore pained, I enter into these perswasions, A man might saile from Trent vnto Daunby, and yet not find so strange a peece as you be. A [XX. Consture my meaning] Consture my meaning, wrest not my method Consture my meaning, wrest not my method, wrest good wil craues fauor, witnes the high God, the high God, if I haue ment well, haue ment well, if I haue ment well, good will reward me, when I deserue ill, no man regard, no man regard me, what shall I say more, speech is but blasting, still will I hope for life euerlasting, for life euerlasting [8 Voices] [XXI. Witnesse ye heauens] Witnesse yee heau'ns, I vow to loue the fairest Witnesse yee heau'ns, I vow to loue the fairest, to loue but how? for vertue not for lust, for vertue why? because she is the rarest.
