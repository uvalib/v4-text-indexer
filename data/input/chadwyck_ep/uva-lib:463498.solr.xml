To the right honourable and truly Noble gentleman, Lord Hen: Clifford, Lord Liuetenent Of the midle shires Of Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland T : R : wisheth all happinesse and encrease of honour. Where should a Poet nowe a Patron finde, To please his own, and please his Patrons minnde? Some, Satyres; others, Epigrammes, desire; Some, Cronicles and Warlicke strains admire; Others, a deepe conceited Pastorall, Or Elegiacks at a funerall: Some are halfe rauish'd with a Tragicke style, Others affect the gentler Comicke smile: Some one perhaps (and not without desart) Likes Heros hand and yonge L√¶anders heart, Sung by diuine Mus√¶us in a story Of loue-sicke passion, worthy of all glory: Others, an Emblem or quaint Epitaphe, Or merry mad conceipts, to make one laugh: Some loue diuiner poems, and in this, Deserue to be commended; but they misse In makinge a iudicious choyce: For why, With painted flowers of Ethnicke Poetry, Good matters (say they) must not be endited, But rather in plaine easy termes recited: Others, regardlesse of the Muses dity, With Plato banish Poets from their city, Because they are too vulgar, and no kinde Of Poetry whats'e'r can please their minde: In faire Encomiasticks to commend, They count it flattery; to reprehend In sharpe-fang'd Satyres, is to libellize, To raise vile slaunders, and false infamies: Base, the Com≈ìdian's witty mirth they deeme, And Epigrammes, phantasticall doe seeme: Thees are a sect, of which most men partake, That litle reckonning of the Muses make. The brazen age is nowe return'd agen, And hath defac'd the Poets siluer pen; Whereas in former time, the greatest men Were not asham'd to be call'd Poets then: Witnesse Augustus, in whose Laureat time, Learning and liberall arts were in their prime, And Poets flourish'd: Persius (though a Knight) Was not ashamed, Satyres to recite; Propertius, borne of enobled race, T'indite Elegies, thought it no disgrace. And sweet Amphion, sonne to princely Ioue, With his shrill Musicke made the stones to moue. Nor did this art moue onely in their sph≈ìre: An Helicon hath not been wanting heere. Then sent forth Cydney, glory of his time, And Chaucer, auld, who for his auntient rythme Obtein'd a monument of lasting praise, That kept his memory to thees our dayes. What should I speake of those of latter yeares? Of Harrington among our noble Peares? Or of thy selfe (great Earle) the Poets grace? Why then should Poets be esteem'd so base?‚Äî Because their pouerty o'rcloudes their witt, And makes men rather scorne, then pity it? Shall vertue, which in riche men we adore, Be e'r the worse esteemed in the poore? Or can not some mens honours credite lend, To that, which others meannesse doth offend?‚Äî Beside, I might recount in ample wise, The profites that from Poetry arrise. Where each thinge, truly acted, we may see, As in a theatre: Aratus, he Shewes vs the p[re]s[ences] of spangled starres; And Lucan singes the broyles of ciuill warres; Of loue, and louers trickes, Catullus tells: With warlicke stratagems, grave Virgill swells, And makes his verse each circumstance betoken, That one would thinke the matter done, not spoken. Ovid is various, and in nimble paces, The love of Gods, the flight of nymphes, he traces, And well he calls it transformation, For he [reuiues] again the [antique] fashion, Transforming truth into a witty fable, So to delight the mindes of the vnstable: His seas of sorrowe, holy dayes, and rites, Letters of passion, arte of loues delights, In eu'ry kinde may teach the rude some skill. Hesiod giues instructions to till; And Homers lofty style would make one doubt, Whether he better sung, or Hector fought. Martiall lends witt; Horace, in sharpe essayes, Against the vices of his time inveighes. Empedocles, in verses did attire Secrets of Nature; and the Samian Sire, Morall Philosophy could grauely teach. But Chrysostome had a farre higher reach: And wise Prudentius, with other Sages, Haue writt diuinely in thees latter ages. What should I bringe Poets antiquity? From Deborah, and Moses victory? What should I tell of Simeon, and Mary? Of Salomon, and Dauid, that could vary Musicall notes vpon his well-tun'd stringe: When the Angellique troopes doe praises singe, And harmony, that nowe is brought to ground, Seemes to begin amid the sph≈ìres so round? Much might I speake in praise of Poet's dity, And make my gates farre larger then my city. I may commend, not mend them with my pen, For Patronage belonges to greatest men. And more to saye were vaine: For Poetry Liues of it selfe, though Poets helplesse be. Yet some M≈ìcenases this age hath left vs, (Though of M≈ìcenas, time long since bereft vs,) That fauour learning, and accept a lay, Though ne'r so mean, though clad in simple grey. Amonge the which, since chiefe I reckon thee, Accept (great Peare) this ruder rapsodie. And though no Muse I am of great desart, Yet fauour graunt; because I loue the arte! Thy better iudgement happily may spie The slender twist of my sleight Poetry: Yet fauourably take it in good part, (If there want wordes, be sure there wants no heart,) And shine vpon my Muse with gracious rayes, So shall it muse to sonnet out thy prayse. Your Honours in all duty, and Seruice to Commaund, Thomas Robinson. The Legend of Mary Magdalene From the Harleian Manuscript 6211, and the Rawlinson Ms. 41 in the Bodleian Library. (The Dedication is in the Harl. Ms. only.) [PART I.] The Life and Death of Mary Magdalene, Or, Her Life in Sin, and Death to Sin. 1 The death of her that was but newly borne: The birth of her that longe agoe was dead: The life of her, whome heauen and earth did scorne: Her beawty, that wast erst debellished: How snowy white inveild the crimson red, And yet the lily sprange vnto the rose, Vnder his spiny fortresse to repose; How sorrowe, ioye, and ioye againe did sorrowe close. 2 How night disrobed of her sad attire, Put on the glitteringe stole of brightest day: How dreary Acheron did once retire, And needs would goe vnto the milky way, To quench his wild fire, and his heat allay: How am'rous heau'n earth, earth heau'n did viewe: How the ag'd Eagle did her life renewe, And blacke not to be dy'd, receiud an other hue: 3 This bee the dity of my oaten reed, Too meane (alas!) such mysteries to tell: Yet heauens mirrour daine mee this one meed! In earthen vessels, heau'nly soules may dwell, And sandy caskets oft invest the pearle: √Üthereall states, and high Angellique traines, (Blest bee the time!) haue sometime tooke y? paines To visit Abells sonnes, poore, silly sheapheard-swaines. 4 Poore, silly sheapheard-swaines! eu'n such am I: (Farre bee pr≈ìsumption from an humble minde!) I will not, (oh, I dare not,) soare too highe, Least hee, that all enlightens, strike mee blinde: Sooth, this is all I craue, to be refind, So to endite a laye with siluer pen, Of Mary, and of Marys sonne: and then Her life, his loue declare, her loue, and life agen. 5 Vnder th' Appendix of a hillocke small, A stately palace in a dale was plac't, Fairely incircled with a marble wall, And with a court of shininge Amber grac't. The Chrystall windowes too, were interchast With Iacynths, Diamonds, and Sappheirs blew[e]: Too happy treasure for so damn'd a crewe, That newe sins hoary make, and ould sins aye renewe. 6 The squared greeces were of beaten gould, (Oh might it euer thus bee trod on ground!) Pillars of Iu'ry did the frame vphould: Ouer the brasen gates stood Venus, crownd With Myrtle chaplets, in a charret round, Drawn by two siluer doues, more innocent Then shee her selfe: in the same continent Blind Cupid seem'd to shoote, and tender hearts vprent. 7 A turrulet tooke vp each angles shade: Two in the middle stood, iust opposite: The battelments of smoothest Iett were made: A glorious out side, eu'ry where so bright, The braine it dizieth, and dimmes the sight. Doubtles Alcides leaft his pillars there, Baccus his Elephants, and Sol his sph≈ìre; While each was chear'd with ioye, and overioyd with cheare. 8 The nimble shaddowes skippinge here a pace, Seem'd in the Amber courts to sporte, and play, Like wanton kidds vpon some steepy place, Or tender lambkins on a sommers day: So doth Apollo's euer-sparkelinge raye Daunce through the heauens spangled firmament To solitary earth, so male-content, And backe from heau'n to earth, in lue of loue is sent. 9 Within this palace dwells a gentle spright Soft, sweete, smooth, tender, Goddesse of all pleasure Amorous, younge, faire slender Aphrodite, To whome the Lydian wealth, the Indian treasure, The Falern wine is brought in lauish measure; The Thyme of Hybla, and the Libyan flore, The gemms of Tagus and the golden shore, With swetest odours and Assyrian Spikenard store. 10 About her head a veile of lawne shee wore; Her garments were of skarlet rosy red: A goulden bowle in her right hand shee bore, Wherein all pleasure and delight were bred: The nations came to her deprostrate bed: Happy was hee, that could obtaine a kisse; Vnhappy he, that of her loue did misse: Yet, oh most happy misse, and most vnhappy blisse! 11 Two Ladies did vphold the Damsells traine, Plumpe, pursiue Luxury, and quainter Pride; The one streight lac'd, and boulstred in amaine; The other in a gowne, large, loose and wide. Both, nearer then the rest, went by her side. Easier it is to empty out the seas, Then her with clothes, and her with dainties please: In flittinge vanities (God wot) so litle ease! 12 Her right hand, guilded Flattery supported; Her left, did fickle Wantonesse vpbeare; Foolish dame Laughter thither too resorted, To paint her eye lids, and her browe to cleare. Idlenesse too, and Iealousy was there, Inconstancie, Despaire, Pr≈ìsumption, And Enuie, that would brooke no Paragon, Put their worst garments of, and their best faces on. 13 A thowsand graceless Graces more be-side, Attended on her, ready at her call: They nowe awaited, but for winde and tide. They launch into the deepe, hoist sayle and all. ‚ÄúCome (saith th' Enchauntresse) 't is our nuptiall, Let others sad and sullen liue, while wee Swimme in the sweets of loue and iollity!‚Äù So, tinklinge on her lute, shee made this harmony: ‚ÄúCome, come, my louers! make no stay! Let's take our pleasure, while wee may: See, how the canopies all ope' To entertaine our loues do hope: See howe the silken beds 'gin swell, Daringe vs their pride to quell. Gold and Amber in their places, Bid vs come, and see our faces: The pretty pearle lends many a smile, The sparklinge gemms our sight beguile, While the marble pillars weepe, 'Cause wee are not yet a-sleepe. Hearke, howe the musike doth delight, Of that yonge slender catamite! See, the snowy virgins white, Hands and lipps, and heart invite. Thousand Hellens faire, I haue And as many Troians braue; Richly they attired bee, Onely to attend on mee. What so'er the sence doth rauish, Heere it swimes in plenty lauish: Ioue to mee hath brought his courte, And the Naiad√´s heere sporte: The Dryad√´s their groues have left, And haue stol'n to me by theft; While y? Cocheman of the Sph≈ìre Loues to driue his horses heere: Neptune too, and Thetis greene, In my palace may bee seene. Neuer saile out of the land! I can giue yee Tagus sand: Neuer goe to Colchos shore! I haue Golden fleeces store. Shades, yee wander all in vaine; Th' Elysian feilds are in my plaine. Then come, my louers, come away! Let's take our pleasure, while wee may!‚Äù 14 This said, a thowsand prostitute delights, Flewe vp and downe y? courts as bright as day: Gluttonie, to a feast her guests invites, And Baccus, to the wine is gone his way: Others more eager, ceaze vpon the prey: The tables richly were adorn'd with store, Of delicates, not known in times of yore. Such, Cleopatra gaue, vnto her Paramour. 15 The chambers were perfum'd with odours sweet, And strow'd with fragrant flowers eu'ry where. The Damsells naked stood (ah, too vnmeet!) The Flute, the Lute, the Timbrell sounded cleare: Flagons of wine were brought, to mend their cheare. 'T was hard to say, which had the most delight, The taste, y? touch, the hearinge, smell, or sight: So ioye triumph'd o'r greefe, and day dispelled night. 16 As, when y? boundlesse, brauinge Ocean, Imbezilinge y? riuers all in pride, Receiues their waters in his ample maine; Some backe againe retire with curled tide, Some through y? mountaines to y? valleys glide, Some struggle with y? brine, and foaminge flie Vp to the pauement of the valted skie, And downe againe, as lowe as hell, they fall, and die; 17 So soone this crewe dispers'd: some to their sporte, Some in greene arbours spent the liue longe day; Some staulked round about y? amber court; Others to gaminge fell, and such like play, And heere and there a drunken louer lay, Who, by his giddy, braine-sicke concubine, Disgorg'd y? venoun baite of raginge wine: 'T is sugar in the mouth; but in the bowells, brine. 18 Fast by, y? Lapith≈ì and Centaures sate, Each largely swillinge in a full-crown'd bowle, Til their tongues tripp'd, and spake they knewe not what, And speakinge made them iarre; and iarringe, scoule, And scoulinge, tumults raise, and vproares foule: Downe goe the tables and the goblets faire; The ruddy wine, spilt on the Iu'ry ware, Seemes like a fiery comet in the cleared aire. 19 What should I tell of all might there be seen? Some were transform'd to swine, and some to Apes, Such was the power of the enchantinge Queen: With Circes virge shee could commaund all shapes, Or giue rancke poyson in a bunch of grapes; Or like Medusas snaky haire at will, Transforme y? wisest Atlas to a hill. Her Magicke knowledge good, but Magicke practise, ill. 20 Amonge y? wanton traines of Luxury, That in her palaces themselues addrest, One was more beautifull vnto y? eye, More faire, more debonaire, then all the rest; In colour and proport√Øon so blest, That, were shee but with softer sleepe alayd, Of virgin waxe you would suppose her made. O Damsell faire without, but inwardely decay'd! 21 Her louely tresses of embellish'd haire, Kist her soft necke, and shoulders iu'ry white: The Apples of Hesperides weere there: So Titan swifte displayes his blazinge light, On toppe of Rhodope, with snow bedight Her eyes, as blacke as Iett, doe finely blaze, Rowlinge about, and they that in them gaze, Looke for themselues in her, halfe lost, as in a maze. 22 What should I of her arched browe relate, Guilded with smiles, and amorous aspects; The port of quietnesse, loues chaire of state? Aurora hither her bright teame directs, And all the while her higher race neglects. Her fluent tongue, with siluer is betipt; And from the caskets of her corall lippe, Ioue may diuine Ambrosia and Nectar sippe. 23 Her ruby cheekes laid o'r the snowy white, (Why may not Antiques erre?) were the rare frame That curious Apelles brought to light: The litle birds ynchantinge hither came, To picke y? ruddy grapelets, was their aime. Her nose, for Venus hill, I might commend; But to the pearle, her teeth doe beauty lend, While her eares pretty gemmes, with louely lookes contend. 24 Next her debared brests bewitch mine eyes, And with a Lethargy my sight appall; But by and by the selfe-wild heauy spies Vnto y? centre of her nauell fall, From whence they starte, awaked at the call Of her depurpur'd thinges, heere at a stand, Whither to viewe y? siluer of her hand, And armes as streight as pine, or subtill Circes wand, 25 Or rather cast a due-deuoted glaunce Vpon the marble tressels vnder plac't: But then her douelike feete themselues aduance: On such, Dianas nymphes y? game haue chast, And the Nere√Ødes, with nimble hast, Trippe vp and downe, forward and backe again[e,] Amid y? gentle murm'ringe of the maine, Curlinge y? flaggy lockes of the Neptunian plaine. 26 Wonder it is, mee thinkes, without to see So faire a face, (aye mee, y? more her smart!) And that her soule should so deglorious bee: A brest so white, and yet so black a heart; Her worst the best, her best y? worser parte. Can such faire hiues inclose such idle Drones? So white a wall inmure such worthlesse stones? So beauteous a sepulchre, such rotten bones? 27 A ‚Äòsepulchre,‚Äô that caue I rightly call, Wherein her soule so longe imu'd hath been, Bound with y? fetters of a willinge thrall: And yet that sepulchre must bury sin, And for Astr≈ìa make a shrine within: It cannot bee, but such a heauenly grace, In heauens quire at length must have a place: But first the goodly corne must winnow'd bee a space. 28 Amonge her riualls iolly nowe shee sate: Each sues for loue, and loue to her affordes; But hee, that strongest was, the conquest gate: No other arte pr≈ìuailes, no sugred words, But force of armes, and dint of steeled swords. (Venus, the Sun still followes with her light; If Titan fauor thee, her rayes shine bright; If hee but hide his head, Venus is out of sight.) 29 So may you see alonge y? meadowes green, Two sturdy bullockes, (hard it is to say, Whither with loue, or furies flames more keen,) Both this and that infect y? purple waye, And make y? sanguine riuelets to play, Flie at each other swifter then the winde, And with y? hornes y? heads together binde: The victor, Io gaines; y? conquer'd comes behind[e.] 30 Great valour, sure to goe into y? feild, And battell bid for Lady Aphrodite, To whet y? sworde, and beare the trusty sheild, To win y? fauor of some f≈ìmale white: 'T were better for thy countries good to fight: There, if thou conquer, thou shalt conquered be; If conquer'd, death thou gainst, or infamy: Heere victorie is fame, and losse of victory. 31 The bloody broyles thus ended and allay'd, Faire Magdalene (for so the Damsell hight) Her louer for his labour well appay'd, And all aggladded with his newe delight, Led by y? hand alonge y? valleys bright: And, as they went, hee am'rous glaunces cas[t] Vpon her rosy cheekes and slender wast; And nowe a kisse hee begg'd, and nowe his loue embract. 32 The glory of the pole did nothinge please him, Apollos haire could not one glaunce allure, Nor did y? fragrant-smellinge meadowes ease him, The melody of birds could worke no cure; So fond is loue, so dotingely dimure: The tender plants, and minerals vnseen, Conquer each sicknesse and disease vnclean; But loue, by the same hand is kill'd and cur'd agen. 33 His sences nowe no frame but hers receiue, And in his fancy eu'ry member paint: His minde, both sence and fancy doth bereaue, And they againe his intellect attaint, To thinke on nothinge but his seeminge saint: Her loue is all hee sees, or heares, or knowes, So the bewitchinge oracle yt throughes About the maidens fancy, strange Deludinge showes. 34 Vnto y? garden by, at length they hy'd: Atlas his orchard was not halfe so rare, Nor Heloriz in midst of Sommer pride: Nor kinge Alcinous his cheifest care: Heere y? dead louers sprights reuiued are: Flora had empti'd heere her precious horne, With store y? beds of pleasure to adorne; No thistle heere was seen, ne pricle-armed thorne; 35 The Damaske-roses heere were brought a bed, Iust opposite y? Lilie of y? Vale: The Rose, to see y? Lilie white, wax'd red; To see y? rose so red, y? Lilie pale; While Zephyre fann'd then with a gentler gale. The woody Primrose and the pretty Paunce, The Pinke, y? Daffodill and Cheuisance, All in Perfumed sets, y? fragrant heads aduance. 36 Sweet Casia, and y? yealowe Marigould, That when the Sun bringes forth y? Orient daye, Her armes, in signe of loue, loues to vnfould, But closes when her Paramour's awaye: The Cullumbine and Violets there play, With Couslips of Hierusalem so nice, Sweet Eglantine, and cloues of Paradise, Rare shrubs, and rarer hearbs, and beds perfum'd with spice. 37 Narcissus too, that heart enamouringe lad, Grewe by a springe (a chrystiall springe was nighe), Whose siluer streames y? gaudy flowers agglad, Glidinge alonge, as if they faine would prie Vnder the Veluet leaues, and by and by Into y? watry cells againe they start, But with a gentle pace, as loath to part, Leauinge y? teares behinde, in token of y? hearte. 38 The flower, mindefull of his former loue, Declines his head toward y? neighbour springe: His sportefull shade, affection seems to mooue, Vnder y? fountaine water wantoninge; Yet to y? banckes his tender rootes yclinge, The silken staulkes 'gan tremble sore affraid, Least once againe Narcissus in his shade Should loose himselfe for loue, and in sad silence fade. 39 All theese delights y? louers' eyes aggrate, But yet y? appetite hath made no stay: Into an arbour nowe at length they gate,‚Äî This was the hopefull Period of y? way;‚Äî An arbour, pleasant, beautifull and gay, Incompast with triumphant baye about, And farther in, y? laden vines ysprout: If Baccus bee within, Apollo stands without. 40 The leauy pillastrells were neatly shorne; The grassy seats, y? eyes to slumber wed; The vaulted roofe, on ample baulkes vpborne, With Violets and Lilies was bespread, Like th' Azure skie with starres besiluered; The floore with many a flower was bedeck'd. The Gilly-flower, and Carnation speck'd, But Lady Rose, y? other with her beauty check'd. 41 On flowry beds y? Louers heere repose; And nowe sweet words must guild their bad intent: With smiles, with lookes, with lippe and hand hee woes: Such were y? Dartes, y? subtill Cupid lent, Lustes wandringe harbinger, vaine complement: Faire ramillets and posies hee pr≈ìpares, With sonnets smooth, and garlands for her haires; And so with gentle pace, into her brest hee fares. 42 What should I tell of those polluted acts That followe wantonnesse and Luxury? Let modesty not meddle with y? facts, Sith tongue and hart, in mischeife still agree, And as y? wordes, y? actions often bee: Their descants nowe they tooke, and restles rest, And thought they were with ioyes of heauen blest; But night as blacke as hell, y? meltinge soules possest. 43 The Sun peep'd in with his declininge raye, And dy'd his paler cheekes with fiery hue; It seems, hee blush'd, and would recall y? day, The wickednesse of Vestaes sonnes to viewe, That rush to folly, but y? folly rue: And thou, my Muse, packe hence with nimble flight! The shame of sinners, 't is no great delight, For modest eare to heare, or chaster pen to write. 44 Thus Magdalene in Pleasures wanton courts, Parte of her youthfull dayes did fondly waste, Ioyinge in vanity and idle sportes, To spend the time, y? soone (God wot) was past. Pr≈ìuentinge all her pleasure with her haste: Parte of her time in idle languishement, Parte in attire, and gaudy ornament, And parte in frolicke feasts and banquetinge, shee spent. 45 Sometimes the palace walkes delight her minde; Sometimes in silken beds shee sweltred lies; And nowe shee's vacant to her louers kinde, And nowe the garden doth inuite her eyes; But by and by, her arbour greene shee spies: Nowe in y? springe shee bathes, to coole her heat, And waues her plume, to fanne away y? sweat; And cooler nowe, shee makes a sunny bancke her seat. 46 So doe the fondlinges of our latter age, In iollity their fresher yeares dispend, Treadinge this sc≈ìne, as't were a silken stage, But neuer dreaminge of a Tragicke end: Can great Iehouah take him for his friend, That in his youth doth nought but wantonize, But when ould age decayes, both eares and eyes, Then to y? altar bringes his haltinge sacrifice? 47 Let none on Magdalens delaye pr≈ìsume, Though (sooth to say) it was not very longe: Life's but a fadinge flower, a subtile fume, A shadowe vaine, a shorte, though pleasant songe. Then oyle your lampes betimes! and in y? thronge Of Saintlie Heroes, enter heau'n amaine; For what the Fates decree, is not in vain[e:] Ioye heere, shall sorrowe there; teares heere, ioy there obtaine. 48 When heau'ns bright eye, farre brighter then the Sun, Beheld th' asp[i]ringe tower of vaine delight, And howe this harlot had her selfe vndon, Hee sent Syneide, daughter of the light, To tell the Caytiffe of her wretched plight: The Damsell brighter then y? brightest glasse, The Isicles in splendor did surpasse, And in her siluer hand, a poynted goad there was; 49 A tiffany shee wore about her head, Hanginge submissely to her shoulders white; From top to toe, she was immanteled With purest Lawne; and, for her nimble sight, Lynceus his eyes were neuer halfe so bright: The Eagles quickenesse in respect is blinde, And Argus with his hundred comes behinde, For myriads of eyes about her body shin'd. 50 Thinges past were pr≈ìsent to her searchinge viewe, And future repr≈ìsented in her thought, Where newe thinges n'er wax'd ould, but oulder newe. Each idle word and action hither brought, Receiue y? doome and censure (as they ought). Sometimes in Paradise shee likes to dwell, Sometimes shee diues into the deepes of Hell; Shee sees the heart, and pries into his closest cell. 51 Faine of her message, nowe shee tooke her flight Through the bright amber of y? flaminge Court, Passinge y? wheeles of purest Chrysolite, Drawn by y? fiery beasts y? there resort, Where millions of Angells euer sporte, And glorious martyrs, after all y? woes, Singe praise to him y? ouercame y? foes, And all y? Saints, y? crownes, at Glories throne depose. 52 Then by y? Chrystall waye shee nimbly past, Vnto y? radiant spangled firmament, Where heauens euer-wakinge sheapheard fast, His starry flockes into y? fouldes had pent. The Gnossian Crowne among y? rest was sent, The Goblet, Helen, and the Brothers twaine, Cassiope, y? Pleiads, and y? Swaine That Arctos kept in warde, with all y? starry traine. 53 And through y? wandring sph≈ìres shee wandringe went, Leauinge y? rasters of the starry light; Then to y? pure √¶thereall element That's whirld about y? hornes of Cynthia bright, Both they and shee out-strippe y? feeble sight, So rare and subtill substances they been. Natures so much depur'd, that (well I ween) No mortall eye, sph≈ìres, fire, or conscience, e'r hath seen. 54 So passinge through y? tripple-region'd ayre, Where diuerse mixtures and aspects appeare: The flyinge Dragon, y? resplendent Haire, The Darte, the Candle and y? burninge Speare, The Milke, the Kidds that skipped here and there, The poynted Beame, th' infatuating Fire, The Northern Com≈ìts and y? painted Ire, With many more, whereof some fall, and some aspire. 55 At length shee touch'd y? toppe of hillockes highe, That ouer-shaddowe Aphrodites towers. And streight-way, in y? twinkling of an eye, Shee windes her selfe into y? secret bowers Of Mary Magdalenes depraued powers: With gentle hand shee prickes her festerd hart; The boylinge blood from eu'ry veine 'gan start, And thus y? wanton mayde assaults with mickle smart: 56 ‚ÄúAh, fondling! whither, whither do'st thou flie With guilded winges of selfe opinion vaine? Can ought escape heauens all-seeinge eye? Or shall thy pleasure breed no after-paine? If so, a Paradise on earth were gaine! But when y? reuolution of yeares Shall bee at hand, then ioy must end in teares, And pleasant spectacles bee chang'd to ghastely feares. 57 ‚ÄúSion was holy to the Lord of yore; Salem's in-habitants his cheife delight; Each to his altar, freewill of-fringes bore, And payd y? Leuite aye the Leuites right; So did y? temple shine with glory bright; Religion ruld y? royall politie With iustice, temperance and √¶quitie: Then let not Magdalene her natiue soile denie. 58 ‚ÄúWilt thou in riot swimme, while others fast? Wilt thou bee sporting, when as others pray? Or canst thou still delight to bee imbrac't, When others, drown'd in sorrowe all y? day, With sacke-cloth gird y? loynes, and sad araye? Or while the aged sire's besprinkeled With dust and ashes on his siluer head, Canst thou thy various Iunonian plumes dispread? 59 ‚ÄúDoubtlesse those haires for lust were not intended; Those eyes for Cupids darts were neuer meant; That heaunly face, by art but litle mended, (Sith nature in it all her skill hath spent,) Was not to bee a wanton's ornament; Those eyes were made so bright, the heauns to see; Those feet, to tread y? paths of √¶quitie: Bee not so bad to him, y? is so good to the!‚Äù 60 This sayd, shee brandishes her quiueringe darte, And makes a deeper wound in Maries brest: The silly soule amaz'd, beginnes to starte, As one awaked from his nightly rest, With slumber soft, and hopefull dreames possest. For pleasure is a dreame of sweet delight, That lastes no longer then y? shortest night, But when the day appeares, awaye it takes his flight; 61 Or as y? nimble doe in lawny parke, Browsinge vpon y? palate-pleasinge brier, Is on a suddaine made y? hunter's marke, And wounded in her brest, perceiues a fire, So Magdalene, in midst of her desire, Crown'd with y? blisse of fooles, and pleasures vaine, Feeles in her heart y? stinge of gripinge paine; And then to feigne sad sighes, and sorrowe, shee is faine. 62 But sorrowe soone in streames of pleasure's drownd, And consc√Øence away doth vanish quite; So litle truth in womens teares are found. The Crocodile can sorrowe to y? sight, And vnder sighes embaite his venom'd spight. Vaine woman! see! y? hart hath quickely found A saluing ditany, to heale his wound: And shall thy heart vnsounded, still remaine vnsound? 63 But custome is a tyrant, and his slaues Are forc'd within his limits to abide. Tis easier to still y? swellinge Waues, And turne y? torrent of y? strongest tide, Then to resist his course, or quell his pride: So Mary to her lust againe returnes, And at Ambrosian mercy, offerd, spurnes, Till Heauens awefull power in zealous anger burnes. 64 Withat a dreary hagge of Acheron, Arm'd with a gastely torch, new dipt in blood, A sable weed, as blacke as night, put on, And in the palaces of Pleasure stood, Shakinge y? frie of her vipereous brood: Fury attends her, and the want of sence, Sorrow, Despight, with y? sad Influence, Famine, and bloody Warre, and meagre Pestilence. 65 The pillars trembled at this ghastely sight; The dores were tainted with a pallid hue; The Sun, amaz'd, deny'd his wonted light, While y? poore mayd, disquieted anewe, Striues to go forth of dores; but there a crewe Of hideous glowinge snakes y? entraunce keepe, That all about y? direfull fury creepe, And in whole troopes from out her shaggy cauerne peepe. 66 Some wandred vp and downe her dismall brest; Some to her pitchy armes and shoulders clunge, With fiery eyes and hissinge tongues possest; And one vpon y? wretched mayd shee slunge, That twininge here and there, about her sprunge, And glided on her brest with gentle hast, And there vipereous cogitations plac't, With pininge greife and sorrowes, y? y? spirites wast. 67 The crinkled snake about her Crystall necke, Seem'd like a wreathed chaine of brightest gould, And for a fillet seru'd, her haire to decke, For through each parte y? slippery pilgrim rould, And fire within y? marrowe did infould, Taintinge y? sences with his poysond gall, That soone y? Damsells riot could appall, And Sorrowe much aggladd at Pleasures funerall. 68 Nowe all yee flittinge daughters of the light, Packe hence with speed, and see, yee bee not seene! Let neuer smile or laughter come in sight! For ioye and ioyllity too longe haue been Within these courtes: but Sorrowe now is queen. Mary hath cast her louers out of minde, And solace in her brest no place can finde, For carking care doth all delights together binde. 69 The Fury nowe (it seemes) has stood her freind, And counsell'd her to bidd vaine sports adieu. But ther's much difference 't-wixt freind and fiend, And hee, y? monster-headed Gorgon slewe, Did but y? ould one in younge snakes renewe: The blood, y? Perseus heere and there did spill, Begate another brood of serpents still. If Hell be cause of good, that good is nought but ill. 70 Into y? hollowe of a darke-some cell, The Messenger of Night conueigh'd her streight: Shee thought, shee had been wafted quicke to hell, So swift shee flewe, y? now shee felt no weight, Till downe shee squats before a balefull gate That euer open stood, both daye and night, To entertaine each sad, disastrous spright, With horrid shapes, and apparitions for his sight. 71 So gape the gloomy courts of Pluto fell, Exhalinge cloudy mistes of sulphur blewe, With horrid damps, and many a noysom smell, Ready to swallowe vp y? damned crewe, That thither hast, and yet y? hast they rue; When death a punishment for life they se[e,] And life for death a punishment to bee, And death with life, and life with death ioyne amity; 72 Or as y? iawes of Scyllas barkinge hounds, That aye for greedinesse of booties raue, And swallowe all that come within y? bounds: Such was y? gap of Melancholies caue, Where many loose, but fewe y? lives can saue; Onely for barkinge hounds, y? grimme-fac'd cat, The slowe pac'd asse was there, y? flutteringe bat, The croakinge rauen on a slaughtred carcasse sate. 73 The ground, no whole-some hearbe, no flower breeds, No fruitfull tree aray'd with sommers hue, But cockell, darnell, thornes, and stinkinge weeds, And wither'd trunkes, deuoy'd of leaues, in liewe Of better plants, with y? fauereous yewe, Beside y? fatal tree, where Phyllis faire Hunge by y? tresses of her goulden haire, For loue of him, y? of her loue tooke litle care. 74 Heere Pyramus and Thysbe murdred lie; Heere Antony and Cleopatra been; Heere Aiax, with his bloody speare fast by; Heere Cato, and y? Carthagenian Queen: Sad spectacles! no sadder euer seen! √Ügeus was heere, deluded once by fame; Empedocles leapt hither through y? flame Of √Ütna; and y? Stagirite by water came. 75 But loe, within, dull Melancholy sits, Proppinge with weary hand his heauy head, And lowringe on y? ground in franticke fits, With pallid hue hee look'd, as hee were dead, Or Death himselfe: for many hee had sped And sent vnto y? graue: rough was his haire, His hollowe eyes, Hy√¶na-like did staire, Sparkelinge like fishes scales amid y? cloudy aire. 76 Longe eares, blacke lippes, teeth yeallowe, meagr[e] face, Sharpe nose, thin cheekes, chin pendant, vaulted cragge, Lean ribbes, bare loynes, lanke belly, snale-like pace, Lame feet, dead hands, and all his garments sag[ge:] Heere hanges a patch, and ther a tatter'd ragge: Such Melancholy hight; and seated so, A thousand Gorgons doe his fancy woe, And horrid apparitions about him throughe. 77 Sometimes with loue his cogitation swells, And then 'gainst churlish riualdry hee braules, And of his Ladies cruelty hee tells, And makes sad plaint vnto y? ruthlesse walles: In hast, for paper, pen, and inke, hee calles, A letter to his loue hee will endite, And with a thorne on ground hee 'gins to wright; Then vp hee takes y? dust, and blowes it out of sight. 78 Sometimes about y? starres his minde doth roue, And light Ambition in his brest beares swaye; And then hee will contend with mighty Ioue, And haue commaund o'r vassal Titan's raye: But, by and by, hee softely steales awaye, And slinkes from out his den, supposinge ther[e] Some furious hagge would him in peeces teare, So closely couch'd hee lies, all quiueringe for feare. 79 Nowe out hee hollowes, and full loudely yells, As if hee chas'd before him some wilde beast: But that deuise another thought expells; And till hee finde his goulden interest, Hid vnder ground, with feare hee is possest: Nowe hee supposes, hee's a man of glasse; And nowe straunge colours seeme before him passe; And now hee thinkes, hee is not, what but nowe hee was. 80 Hard by his side, sad Magdalene was plac't, Within y? vgly caue of this dull spright. Kindely each other at y? first embrac't, But soone shee felt y? rancor of his spight, For all her daye was turned into night: And shee, y? was with pleasure lately crown'd, Now hanges y? head, and viewes y? cursed ground, Bearinge about her still an euer-smarting wound. 81 As in the splendor of a glassy sphere, What s'euer hee y? vewes it, doth assaye, Bee sure to see it repr≈ìsented there, The mimicke orbe each action will bewraye, And in a nimble shaddowe soone displaye The motion of y? foot, y? hand, y? eye, The lippes, y? tongue, and tell what is awry,‚Äî Whither hee sad his browe, or looke more cheerfully,‚Äî 82 So Magdalene is Melancholies Ape, And, what soe'r hee does, assayes to doe: His fancy bringes him each fantasticke shape, And so fantasticke is her fancy too: Hee stayes, shee stands: hee stirres, and shee doth goe: Hee trembles at y? trembling of the winde; Shee feares each blast: hee beares a guilty mind; A guilty conscience shee within her brest can finde. 83 There is a path adown a steepy waye, Wrapt all in vncouth silence of the night, Where wandringe (cursed hap!) poore pilgrims stray[e,] A path, y? leades vnto y? lake Cocyte, Where hellish torments wretched soules affright, Where deadly scritch-owles direfull dities sing[e,] The grisly ghostes y? sorrowe ecchoinge, And all about y? aire y? poyson'd vapours clinge. 84 A thousand gates and entraunces there bee, To Lethes burninge waues and scaldinge fire, But backe againe, wee no returne can see; The Lions den lets fewe or none retire: And though y? intricate D√¶dalean gyre Haue many portalls, easy to attaine, Yet hee y? knowes how to returne againe. May count y? countles sands, and make y? mountains plaine. 85 As Amphitrite in her larger wombe Receiues all other floods and Chrystall brookes, So doth this lake all hopelesse soules in-tombe, And still it hath more roome, for more it lookes: So many windinges there, and wandringe nookes, That, though all nations of y? world should cease, And fall together in a close-throng'd prease, Yet boundlesse hell could ne'r perceiue his owne encrease. 86 There raginge winter euer doth abide, And yet no showre, y? burninge tongues to wet: They allwayes haue y? parchinge sommer tide, And yet no sun, y? frozen limmes to heat: So doe they fryinge freeze, and freezinge sweat: And (y? which to y? gripinge paine and greife Still addes a newe supplie without releife) √Üternity amonge y? torments is y? cheefe. 87 Hither came Nemesis, and left y? skie; (In iust reuenge shee tooke so much delight:) Soone as shee entred with her maiesty, The ghostes inuegled with perpetuall night, Stood all amaz'd, and trembled at the sight: Their eyes were dazled with her bright attire, But, o, they quaked at her awfull ire, Freezinge with fearefull could amid the flames of fire. 88 Amonge y? blacker sonnes of Tartary, Seu'n hideous fiery sprights shee euocates: They came with speed; yet durst not come too nigh, Least, happily adiudged by y? Fates, They should augment y? chaines and heauy weights: For Iustice could not Stygian vassals brooke; But terrified them with her angry looke, And heau'nly maiesty in hell vpon her tooke. 89 In thunder then shee spake, great silence made, (At eu'ry worde shee shak'd y? gates of hell) ‚ÄúGoe to y? earth, and seeke y? wanton maide That erst in idle Pleasures courts did dwell, But nowe remaines in Melancholies cell! Torment and vexe her! take away her rest! Enter her thoughts! fully possesse her brest! But spare her life! in y? yee haue no interest.‚Äù 90 So hauinge giu'n her charge, awaye shee flinges From out y? cauernes of aye-lastinge woe, And postes vnto y? skie with nimble winges, Where Iris by y? waye salutes her lowe, And on her weeds sweete water shee would throughe: But y? immortall power gaue no consent: For though vnto y? poyson'd lake shee went, Vncapable shee was of y? sulphurean sent. 91 The Hierarchies and Dominations bright, Burned in fiery zeale and zealous fire, Soone as thees tidings shee had tould arright, And all with her in iust reuenge conspire: The hellish fiends were glad at Heauens ire; And though about them they y? to[r]ments bore Yet nowe more ioyfull then they were before, The damned spirits scund'd alonge y? Stygian shore. 92 Through sad Cimmerian mistes as blacke as night, At length to fresher aire they did aspire; Though dazled with y? glimmeringe of the light, They easily found out this aged Sire: Swift was y? speed, but swifter y? desire, Had not they been with iron chaines confin'd, By him y? greeat Leuiathan can binde. Then let not silly Saints bee troubled in y? minde. 93 Soone as into his cell they entraunce made, (And soone they entraunce made into his cell,) Leauinge y? borders of the airy glade, Within y? Damsells brest they come to dwell, And thither bringe they mischeefes store from hell: Scorpions, and flames of √Ütna, to affright; Madnesse and feare, with many a ghastely sight, And malice (what more deadly?) like a womans spight. 94 But then y? haplesse maide (vnhappy tide!) Incited by y? monsters huge within, Runs maddinge vp and downe y? citie wide, Like to y? top, y? in his gyre doth spin, When game-some lads with limber stroakes begin To scourg it round about some larger court, That fecches compasse, while y? simple sorte Stand wondringe at y? swiftenesse of y? boxen sport. 95 The stroakes adde heart, and driue it forward well: No slower pace y? maide is forcd to hie, Through th' midst of cities, and of people fell; Beside, [i]nto y? woods shee seemes to flie, Like to y? Menades y? ‚ÄòEuh≈ì‚Äô crie, And in the honour of y? God of wine, Nourish y? sacred haire, and doe entwine Their tender Iuy iauelins with y? braunchinge vine, 96 That girt about with y? faire spoyle of hindes, Their merry orgialls and iollities Aye celebrate, with mad outragious mindes, And fill y? great circumference of y? skies With hideous shouts, and vaste redoubled cries. So doth y? Damsell wander heere and there, Trailinge along her lowe dissheueld haire, With fearefull fire enflam'd, and could with fiery feare. 97 Nowe through y? aire with nimble pace shee braues, And on y? top of snowy hills is plac't; And nowe vnto y? dales beneath shee waues, And yet shee knowes no reason of her hast: Sometimes shee makes her nest in deserts waste, And groaues become her den, with trees around; But litle it auailes to hide a wound: A guilty conscience maye in darkest night bee found. 98 Nowe shee is catchinge Cynthia by y? horne, (For so y? troubled fancy will suppose,) And nowe y? wandringe plan≈ìts shee doth scorne; Vnto y? higher Cynosure shee goes; But by and by a newe delusion throughes Her pride as lowe as Phlegetonticke maine. So litle blisse eu'n in our dreames wee gaine; And for such momentary ioye, such endlesse paine. 99 Heere a longe time musinge in mind shee stayes, Conceitinge shee in Pluto's court remaines: Heere flames shee sees: ‚Äògreater, my flames!‚Äô shee sayes; There ice congeald; but coulder are her veins; And all y? fictions of infernall paynes, Shee to her selfe ascribes: dire vulturs rent Her bowells, Tityus-like; and shee is spent With longing for y? fount and tree neare-imminent. 100 And Sisyphus his stone, shee makes account, Comes rouling, troulinge downe y? hill againe, That erst shee labour'd vp y? steepy mount: And nowe shee must endure Ixions paine On y? tormentinge wheele: then all in vaine With Danaus his daughters shee helpes fill The siue-like vessells, y? y? water spill Out at a thousand holes, y? taske renewinge still. 101 Thus (ah poore soule!) shee's tossed too and fro: The deadly feinds, y? furious will obtaine: And nowe her body headlonge downe they throughe, Into y? brinish waters of y? maine; And nowe in fiery flames shee's allmost slaine: Sometimes shee liues in dens and hollowe caues, Sometimes shee has her dwellinge in y? graues, And sometimes on y? top of ragged rockes shee raues. 102 No freinds can now persuade her to abide; No bolts of iron can her feet detaine: The spirits driue her on with winde and tide: (Where reason's failinge freindshippe is but vaine) Fetters, like limber strawes, shee breakes in twaine, And then vnto y? monuments shee flies, Where, groavelinge on the ground, shee breathlesse lies: When (poore distressed soule!) oh when, wilt thou arrise? 103 Vnhappy seruants to such Fairy nymphes! Vnhappy younglinges, that haue such a sire! Vnhappy handmaides to such cursed impes, That, for a litle sweete of vaine desire, Adde paine to paine, and fuell to y? fire! Vnhappy Magdalene! vnhappy I! Vnhappy all vnder y? azure skie, Had not heau'n pity'd earth, and life been pleas'd to die. 104 No cruelty with Hellish, maye compare, For, from this fount, all cruelty proceeds: While bloody Sylla no mans blood will spare, (The walles lament, and swellinge Tyber bleeds); The Furies fury, fury slaughter breeds: Eight thousand Romans, Mithridates sped With one sad letter: and on bodies dead, Through Vergell, did y? Punick wight his army lead. 105 From Hell, Perillus fetcht his bull of brasse, Wherin him-selfe first learnt to lowe and roare; Th' Italian Turke from hence deriued was; And army-murdringe peeces from this shore, Were, by y? Spanish frier, brought in store: There Cain first learnt his brothers blood to spill; Herod, his endlesse fury to fullfill, Had a decree from thence, y? tender babes to kill. 106 Fond worldlinges then, that make a league with Hell, As if thees quicke sands did not all beguile; If so it were, y? Scythians sure did well T' adore y? Fiend for feare, and those of Nile To worshippe Ibis and y? Crocodile: But pride and tyrany together rise: Since Lucifer 's debarred from y? skies, Hee in y? ayre his stratagems doth exercise. 107 Witnesse distressed Maries sad estate, Who erst with worldely happinnesse was blest, And liu'd in Pleasures affluence of late: But gnawinge Conscience, deuoy'd of rest, Her shorte-liu'd pleasure quickely dispossest, Her former iollity, tormenting thought, Terrour of conscience, melancholy wrought That misery, and misery to Mercy brought. [PART II.] Mary Magdalens death to sinne or Her life in righteousnesse. The numbering of the stanzas begins again with 1 in the MS., but it is carried on from Part I in this text, for convenience of reference. 108 Soe night with sable weedes 'gan disapeare, So melancholy vanishd quite away; So ioy her chearfull countenance did reare, So did the orient day-springe bringe the day, And all the trees were clad with bloominge May: The gladsome wren sate carolinge y? while, And faine the Titmouse would the day beguile, But vnderneath, the meadowes at y? musicke smile. 109 Why did the flowers blaze in wanton pride, And pearke y? heades aboue the tender stalkes? Why was the Mary-gold distended wide? Why sange the birds amonge their leauy walkes? Why skipp'd the lambs vpon their steepy balkes? Certes, the welbeloued went that waye, The heire of heauen, from whose glorious ray The Sun deriues his light, and Phosphorus y? daye. 110 And as that way he went (thrice happy houre!) He spy'd a mayde come tumblinge downe apace, From toppe of hills, y? to the heauen towre: A hollowe voice he heard, y? would aghast A wandringe straunger, and the Spirits cast Her beauteous frame before his whiter feet, And boweinge to y? ground, (as it was meete,) His maiesty with feigned salutations greete. 111 Then with their vncouth hollow soundinge voice, (Such language Hell had taught them longe agoe,) They roare and crye aloude with hydeous noyse, ‚ÄúWee knowe thy name; and whence thou art, we knowe: O doe not vse vs licke a cruell foe! Thou art the Sonne of God, for euer blest! Thou cam'st to saue; then saue vs with y? rest, And dispossesse vs not from out this balefull brest! 112 ‚ÄúWee bee y? harbingers of heauens ire, Wee Mercuries vnto Astr√¶a bright, Wee punish sinners in y? lake of fire, Wee giue thee reuerence, and homage right, And dutifully tremble at thy sight; While man doth mocke at heauens ofspringe still, Wee yeeld obedience to thy sacred will: Thou art a springe of good; oh, worke not vs this ill!‚Äù 113 Wonder it is, y? this accursed crue Should knowe y? Sauiour, whom but few could knowe; Sure, they obseru'd his white and ruddy hue, That made him cheefest of 10 thousand showe, His lockes as blacke as rauen, and y? snowe Of his faire Doue-like eyes. His cheekes beneath Bedight with flowers, like beds of Spices breath; His lily lippes, pure myrrhe vnto his spouse bequeath. 114 His hands, gould ringes beset with Chrysolite; His mouth, with sweetnesse fraught, and odours newe; His belly vnder, like y? Iu'ry white, All interchast with veins of Sappheirs blewe: His pleasant countenance like Hermons dewe, His leggs and feete, like marble pillers rare On goulden sockets, yet by farre more faire: His vestures, with y? Casia perfum'd y? aire. 115 A robe hee wore, like to his essence, pure; That vndiuided; vndeuided hee: No wonder then (though 't seemes a wonder, sure) That gloomy hell withouten eyes can see, Iesus alone y? holy one to bee, And y? Messias, y? should sin deface: Such was his countenance and louely grace, That they bewrayd his country, and his heau'nly race. 116 Though thought be free, nor can y? Stygian frie Enter y? chambers of our better parte, (For y? belonges to heau'ns all-seeinge eye, To search y? reines, and vnderstand y? hearte, Nor will he this vnto his foes imparte) Whither they through y? Sences windowes pry'd, Or this by reuelation espy'd: They knewe our Sauiours thought, and what would them betyde. 117 But thus y? subtill serpents him bespake, Hopinge, of Mercy, mercy to obtaine: Yet simple elues, y? marke they did mistake, And hopinge prayd, and prayinge prayd in vaine: For hee, poore Adam's sonnes will rather gaine; ‚ÄúYou knowe me, (said hee) but I knowe not you; And yet I knowe yee for a cursed crewe: Then leaue your habitation, and seeke a newe! 118 Like as y? thunder on mount Sinai hearde, With flashinge lightninges and shrill trumpets sounde, The future nations of Salem feard, And made them flie, or fall flat on the ground, Soe doth y? thunder of his voice confounde The powers of hell, who from his glorious sight, Swellinge with rancor, blasphemies and spight, Vnto y? dungeon againe they take y? flight. 119 Soone as they tooke y? leaue, y? causd her thrall, Downe sunke y? Damsell in amazement deepe, (After an earth-quake, soe the ground doth fall,) And soundinge, yeelded to a sencelesse sleepe, Ne could shee speake a worde, ne could shee weepe: But he y? conquered all the powers beneath, The Hell of sin, and sin of Hell, and Death, Soone brought againe y? maydens pantinge, faintinge breath. 120 With milke-white hand, hee by y? hand her tooke, And stayd her faintinge head, and bad her cheare: The burninge feuer then her heart forsooke, Instead of which there came a suddaine feare: So, when y? night begins to disappeare, The dawinge of y? day with glimmeringe light, That seemeth vncouth to y? weaker sight, One newly layd a sleepe, and new awakd doth fright. 121 But feare soone vanishd, when y? heauenly swan, With Musicke of his voice did comforte giue; And then to sue for fauour shee began, And humbly craue y? shee with him might liue, That did her soule from Hell and death repreiue. As yet he granted not her suite: but said, ‚ÄúThy trespasses are pardoned (O maide)! Repent thee; and to sin heere after, bee affrayd!‚Äù 122 Thus did y? winged Perseus of y? skie Deliuer our distress'd Andromede, That nowe with greefe pr≈ìpar'd herselfe to dye By y? waue-tossinge monster of y? sea, The sea of Acheron: nowe Panopee, With all her nimphes, scuddes on y? marble plaine; The storme is ouerblowne, and once againe Daye triumphes ouer night, and pleasure ouer paine. 123 The ship, that erst was toss'd with winde and tyde; Hath nowe y? port of quietnesse attaind; The pilgrime wandringe through y? deserts wide, Hath nowe at length a ioyefull harbour gaind; And shee, that erst was pitied and plaind, Nowe weepes for ioy, and ioyes in sorrow true; And faire Syneide is return'd to viewe Her chambers, and to build y? palaces a newe. 124 No sooner had she entred, but y? mayde Felt a warme motion within her brest, And hard a tongue (though none shee sawe) y? sayd: ‚ÄúGoe to y? courts of Wisedome, gentle guest; There seeke Repentance, and with her, find rest: Repentance hath a flood, doth euer flowe, A flood of brinish teares and bitter woe, That, bee thou n'er soe blacke, will make thee white as snowe.‚Äù 125 Mary, aggladded at this ioyfull newes, Seekes for y? palaces of Sapience; A siluer doue, y? way vnto her shewes, And with his bill giues her intelligence, Soe that shee needs no conduct of y? sence, And yet shee can not bee without it well. Such pleasure, by y? way shee goes, doth dwell, 'T is hard to bee conceiud, but harder farre to tell. 126 The forrests were like fragrant Lebanon: Pome-granates sweete, and saffron there contend; Spiknarde and Camphire with browne Cinnamon; Calamus, Myrrhe and Aloes befreind Th' enamourd ayre, and all about they send Perfumes, exhaled from y? spicy beds. And heere and there a springe of milke dispreads, And hony-dewe y? sweeter shrubs of spices weds. 127 The riuers shind with oyle, and on y? shore Faire Margarites and costly iewells laye; The land emboweled great mines of Ore, And all a-longe y? tinne-decayinge way, The goodly Cedars seem'd to bidde her stay: These did her captiuated eyes delight; The flowry beds detaine her feete so white, And middle-siz√´d shrubs her tender hands invite. 128 But then a rarer spectacle shee spies, The tower of Wisedome, y? did seeme to threat, With highe-aspiringe toppe y? cloudy skies: The ground-worke on a massy rocke was set, That neither windes could hurt, nor waters great. Sharpe prickinge thornes and thistles were before; On each side, desarts waste, and wilde beasts roare; Beyond, a furious sea doth wrastle with y? shore. 129 Why standes it on a hill?‚Äîher glorie's highe; Why on a rocke?‚Äîshee constant doth perseuer; Why thornes before it?‚Äîhard aduersity And spiny labour goe before her euer; Why seas beyond it?‚Äîhead-longe folly neuer Is farre from daunger; why on eyther side Desarts and beasts?‚Äîif either way you slide, Into a thousand toylesome Labyrinths you glide. 130 What should I of this palace more relate, That in it-selfe all beauties doth enfould? All there was pretious, and of highest rate, And though all glist'red not, yet all was gould, Or moulde as pure, or farre the purer mould. Watchfull Humility still kept y? dore, And none had entrance to y? courte, before They crau'd her helpinge hand, and did her ayde implore. 131 Humility, instructions harbinger, Sorrowes glad ofspringe, mother of our peace, Charities nurse, Religions fosterer, Path-way to heauen, troubled soules release; Prides great abater, vertues great encrease, Others by risinge, raize y? high desires; But when shee lowest falls, shee most aspires; Shee dulls y? sharpest swordes, and quenches flaminge fiers. 132 Magdalene entred with this happy guide; And all amazed at y? rasters bright, Stone-still shee stood, till Wisedome shee espy'd, With her owne worke of needle-worke bedight: Then while shee wonders, giue mee leaue to write Of her, with whome y? Sun may not compare: Doue-like her eyes; her lockes of curled haire, A flocke of kids, y? on mount Gilead feedinge are 133 Her temples, peices of Pomegranates seeme; Her feet, like newe-wash'd sheepe, ordred arright; Her lippes, a thred of scarlet, you would deeme; Her necke, like Dauids tower, where men of might Hange vp y? Targets, all in open sight; Her brests like two yonge roes of ≈ìquall age, Amid y? lilies that haue pasturage: Her talke is euer comely, sweet her carriage. 134 Doth any, honours diadem admire? With her, immortall honours euer dwell. Doth any, great possessions desire? Her riches, fadinge treasures farre excell. Is any thirsty? shee's a liuinge well; Shee makes y? weake man stronge, y? foolish wise; Shee lends y? lame man feete, y? blinde man eyes; Shee feedes y? hungry soule, and clothes y? naked thighes. 135 Wisedome's y? best of thinges, th' immortal treasure, The double booke of Nature and of grace, Honour deuoyd of shame, and painelesse pleasure, Pilot of life, and life of eu'ry place, Nobles reiecter, raiser of y? base, Falsehoods discouery, light of humaine sence, The great Allmighties subtill influence, Mirrour of maiesty, heauens purest Quintessence. 136 Oh that I might for euer heere abide, Within y? palaces, that age out-last, And stay with Mary hard by Wisedomes side; How nimbly would y? goulden numbers hast, When of her Nectar I should sippe a tast. Hence did y? waters of Castalian plaine First issue forth, though in a purer vaine: And shee, y? Pallas is, of great Iehouahs braine. 137 But nowe, behould, a goodly company Of Wisedomes children stand about her round: Two roomes shee hath, this lowe, the other highe: Heere sate Prince Salomon, and Dauid crownd, With thousands of his Saints in pleasure drownd. There stood y? Monarche of this tripple Isle: The Destinies for euer on him smile. Others there were, but fewe, or none appear'd y? while, 138 Beside all those that fauour her essayes, Whom in her palaces shee highly grac't, And crownd with garlands of immortall bayes, That soe y? names might neuer be defact, Nor by y? tyrany of time eract, That they y? Muses with y? fauour rayse, And, by y? trumpet of y? Muses prayse, Out-weare all-wearinge time, and liue immortall dayes. 139 But whither doe my wandringe numbers straye? Returne (yee Muses) to the path againe! And yet, with Wisedome, well they wander may, Better then walke right on with folly vaine. Heere all y? while stoode Magdalene, soe faine To meete Repentance: Wisedome at y? last With hand in hand (shee knew y? Damselles hast) Conductes her thither, where y? weepinge grace was plac't. 140 Streightly immured in a closet small, Repentance sate, with eyes still fixt on ground; A-downe her cheekes y? tricklinge teares fall; Her slender hands, her tender brest ywound; And, (woe is me!) shee cries with sighinge sound: Her carelesse-hanginge haire shee teares, her head Was crownd with thornes, with dust besprinkeled; Her loynes with sacke-cloth girt, her feete vncouered 141 Angells stood round about her, as her gard, (Though to y? outwarde eye, they were not seene) And what on earth was sayd, in heaun was hard, And all her teares were kept in bottels cleane; (Teares, though a signe, yet ease of sorrowes keene:) Her head was stayd by y? Angelique crewe, Who all besprinkled her with holy dewe, That shee might neuer faint, but aye her plaints renewe. 142 A Crystall riuer swifte before her fled, (Noe other lookinge-glasse shee had, poore soule,) Instead of waues, the teares lift vp y? head, And to y? muddy shore of sin they rowle, Beatinge against y? rocke of scandalls fowle: The water of it was exceedinge tarte, Sore to y? eyes, but saluinge to y? heart: Thees streames, abundant teares to all sicke soules imparte. 143 Teares, y? Soules bath, y? weepinge oliue tree; Teares, cause of comforte, though effect of greefe; Teares, heauens showers, y? dewe of Iris bee, Teares, amonge Paradises riuers cheefe, Teares, P≈ìnitences badge, and hearts releife; Teares bee y? sinner's solitary sporte; Teares, hopefull sorrowe's longe-desired port; Teares, handmaides to Repentance in Astr√¶as courte. 144 Repentance is y? way to life by death; Repentance, health giu'n in a bitter pill; Repentance, hearbe of grace, diuiner breath; Repentance, rectifier of the will; Repentance, loue of good, and hate of ill; Repentance, mirth at last, though first annoy; Repentance, Ibis, y? doth snakes destroye; Repentance, earth's debate, heau'ns darlinge Angels ioye. 145 Teares quench y? thunder-bolts of zeale diuine, Repentance makes y? cruellst foe repent: Teares keepe from putrefaction with y? brine, Repentance sharpe, but sweetend by content: Teares earthly, yet vnto y? heauen sent; Repentance euer doth y? worke begin: Teares follow her, and cleanse y? sinke of sin: Come, come, ye Saints, a pace! and with Repentance inne. 146 Desire's y? cause of Sin; Sin, cause of greefe; Greife bids repent, Repentance bringes forth teares; Teares, pitie mooue, and pitty graunts releife, That comforte, comforte hope, which nothinge feares; Hope leades to faith, faith to y? Sauiour reares: Iesus, to blisse, his militants doth raize; Blisse causes glory, glory ends in prayse; Prayse ends in him, y? no begininge knew, nor end of dayes. 147 This made y? Damsell in distressed state, Hopinge in teares to drench her misery, Stand waitinge still at P≈ìnitence's gate: Where, when shee knockt, Repentance by and by Demaunded, whoe was there; shee made replie: A sinfull soule.‚Äî (Rep.) Then must you not come heere. (Magdal.)Oh, let me in (sweet Grace!) you need not feare. (Rep.)Thou wilt defile my bridall chamber.‚Äî(Mag.) I am cleare. (Rep.)148Cleare? Whoe hath cleard thee, or with gracious light Illumined thy minde?‚Äî (Magd.)The holy one. (Rep.)Where bee y? Spirits of Infernall night, That whilome thee possest?‚Äî (Mag.)Oh; they are gone. (Repent.)Where bee thy louers?‚Äî (Mag.) I am heere alone. (Rep.)If I admit thee, wilt thou not repent? (Magd.)Repent I neuer will.‚Äî (Rep.) To what intent Should I then let thee in, if thou wilt n'er repent? (Magd.)149 Oh yes, I will repent me of my sin; But of Repentance I will n'er repent. (Rep.)What wilt thou doe, if y? I let thee in? (Mag.)With sorrowes due, I'll paye thee yearly rent. (Rep.)What di≈ìt wilt thou haue?‚Äî (Mag.) Sighes to relent. (Rep.)They 're too stronge-breath'd.‚Äî (Ma.)Fitter for my weake plaint.‚Äî (Rep.)What more?‚Äî (M.) Fewe teares. (Rep.) y? heat will make (M.)I freeze. (Rep.) They coulder are. (M.) I burne. (Rep.) Come in, poore Saint! 150 Soe in shee came, directed by her guide, And dipt her finger in y? brinish well, And with her eyes y? sharpnesse of it try'd, From whence y? teares, as thicke as showers, fell, And raisd y? bubles of y? watry cell, As when a doubtfull cloud dissolus his raine, Into y? ample bosome of y? maine: His showers, her teares, y? fell, seeme all to fall in vaine. 151 Her head hunge downe, (heauy it was with greefe,) Nor durst shee euer looke vp to y? skie: Of sinners shee esteem'd herselfe y? cheefe, And knewe y? wrath of heauens maiesty. Fast on y? moystened floore, shee cast her eye, And eu'ry where shee findes some cause to plaine, But still Syneide comforts her againe, And tells her, y? y? lambe, for sinners must bee slaine. 152 At length a rufull voice her silence brake, Like swellinge waters, troubled with y? winde, And thus with greefe of heart y? Damsell spake, ‚ÄúAh, foolish woman, to thy selfe vnkinde! When others see, howe longe hast thou been blinde? Witnesse y? flash of pleasure for a while, That, with y? falshehood of a guilded smile, Did thee, poore wretch, allure; alluringe, did beguile. 153 ‚ÄúVaine pleasure, cause of endlesse paine, adieu! Sweete is thy baite, but deadly is thy baine, When for an howres delight, an age wee rue, An ounce of mirth procures a world of paine, And pleasure in his infancy is slaine: The swellinge bubble, sweet flower, springinge grasse, Falls, fadeth, is not, what but now it was: But shorter pleasure, all in shortnesse doth surpasse.‚Äù 154 Thus shee laments, and while shee casts her eyes Vpon y? water, y? was vnder placd, Her gentle shadowe, mourninge shee espies, And all y? beauty of her face defacd: ‚ÄúOh, hadst thou euer, (sayes shee) thus been grac'd, Beauty, thou rocke of Soules, faire Sirens smile, Nights glitteringe glowe-worme, wepinge Crocodile. Beauty more lou'd then purest gould, then drosse more vile. 155 ‚ÄúAnd yet y? pourtract of this outward frame, The rarest gifte, y? euer from aboue Heau'n did on earth bestowe, had not y? shame Of wretched man with-drawne his makers loue: For, saue his soule infused by y? Doue, What else in man worth note?‚Äîvnhappy fall. Since when (but whoe can date expir'd recall?) That which is best in vs, wee make it worst of all. 156 ‚ÄúThees haires, y? modestly should haue beene ty'd (For modesty 's a maydes best ornament) Layd out in tresses, haue declar'd my pride: Thees eyes were made to viewe y? firmament, And giue Him glory, y? such glory lent. But (woe is mee!) they haue y? glasses beene, Where folly lookd, and wantonnesse was seene, Soe ioyfull to attend vpon y? Cyprian Queene. 157 ‚ÄúThees cheekes should blush at sin with crimson die, But they to lewdnesse cheefely doe inuite, With smiles deceiuinge y? behoulders eye: Thees lippes were made to prayse, and pray arright, Not to delude y? soone-deluded sight: This tongue should singe out Halleluiahs, Not accent vaine lasciuious essayes: Hands, feet, heart, all were made, to speake y? makers prayse. 158 ‚ÄúBut I (poore wretch! such wretches, sinners bee), Led captiue by y? powers of Hell beneath, Each member haue defild, noe parcell free, And liuinge, entred in y? snares of death, Vnworthy then to drawe this vitall breath. Oh that I might those yeares againe recall, That made me free to Sin in Pleasures thrall.‚Äù Yet better late repente, then not repent at all: 159 No siluer haires her goulden twist had chang'd, No pallid hue assaild her rosy-red, No wrinkles had her browe from loue estraung'd, No rottenesse her Iu'ry teeth be-spread: Youth in his freshest colours flourished. And yet shee thought, in humblenesse of minde, The dayes to longe, y? had her thus confin'd, Repentance, with y? least offence, some falt can finde. 160 Thus in her selfe, her selfe shee wellnigh lost, And on her selfe her sighes and sorrowes spent; Till y? next roome her cogitations crost, With pearly teares and Crystall due besprent, And gaue her store of matter to lament: Then shee begins a-fresh, (for to her thought Thees spectacles y? courts of Pleasure brought, Where ill was counted good, and good was counted naught.) 161 ‚ÄúFaire courtes without, but foulest sinkes within, Vnder your roofes, would I had neuer beene! Sweet sportes, but leauend with a lumpe of Sin! Would God, I neuer had your madnesse seene! And thou, vaine Pleasure, youths adored queene, Oh, maist thou euer bound in hell remaine, And suffer torments of ≈ìternall paine! For thou hast ship-wrackt all, and many a Soule hast slaine. 162 ‚ÄúBetter it is with-in this narrowe roome To spend our flittinge dayes, and closely keepe, Then, while wee liue, soe fairely to intombe Our soules in Marble pleasures, y? will weepe Dayes without end, when wee haue tooke our sleepe. Better, this well of teares, then clearest founts, For sad Repentance, in true ioye surmounts Vaine Pleasures shady bowers, sweet gardens, rich accounts. 163 ‚ÄúBetter thy thorne-bush then a crowne of Myrtle, Thy ashes, better then y? bread of strife; Better thy sacke-cloth, then a silken kirtle; Thy bitter, better then y? sweetest life; Better thy selfe, then is y? rarest wife: Repentance, hearts content, y? sinners stay, The salt of all our actions, y? key That opens heau'n, and leads into y? courts of day. 164 ‚ÄúThe hate of sinfull life, and sorrowes deepe, Surpasse y? loue of life, and life of loue: For what is y? which wantons ‚Äòloue‚Äô yclepe, But hot desires y? doe each passion mooue, And through y? veines with lust-full poyson roaue; A foolish fancy and a pleasinge paine, That dimmes y? eyes, and dulls y? purest braine. But loue, from heauen came, and thither goes againe.‚Äù 165 So nowe, me thinkes, her waylinge should be done, The closets shutt, y? liquid fountaine drie; Herselfe, loue, pleasure, shee hath ouer-run, Yet downe her cheekes y? Isicles doe hie, Though sad laments and waylinge accents die: Sighes serue for voice, teares for a tongue, to showe The meaninge of her minde, and inward woe: And when all's done, abroad shee and Repentance goe. 166 And as they walke abroad in open aire, Each thinge shee spies, is matter of her teares: The creatures with her-selfe shee doth compare; And when y? Sun in bright array appeares, He blushes at her shame; and when shee heares The chirpinge birds, she thinkes they doe reioyce To see her weepe, and heare her broken voice; And vpon her alone, y? beasts to gaze make choyse. 167 As by she passes, each tree shakes his head, Notinge her shame, and infamy of life: The flowers turne, and seeme refuse her tread; The buzzinge flies about are very rife; The winde, against her, blowes with mickle strife: But to herselfe most sharpe, she rents her haire, Showringe forth teares, with sighes and humble prayer, So to content y? earth with teares, with sighes y? aire. 168 Then a newe contemplation shee invents, (But all her contemplations holy were,) And thus with piteous mone shee sore laments, Holdinge her hands vp to y? spangled sph√¶re: ‚ÄúOh thou y? guidst thy burninge horses there, Thy state I envie, sith thy race is run From East to West, and mine scarse yet begun; My darknesse, others blindes; to others, shines y? Sun. 169 ‚ÄúSweete is y? smell, y? fragrant flowers bringe, Wouinge y? winde to kisse them once againe; Sweet are y? notes, y? birds sit carolinge To him y? made them; but y? filthy staine Of sin hath mee disodour'd, and my straine Tunes nought but vanity and fond delight: The grasse with freshest colours is bedight; The trees bringe fruit: but fruitlesse I, as darke as night. 170 ‚ÄúThe fire hath heat, but I was dead in sin: The aire is moist, my vertue withered: Solid y? earth: but I haue euer been Vnstable: water coole; I, tortured With burninge lust: All haue perseuered In true obedience, performinge still, What was inioyn'd them first by heauens will, While I, vnhappy soule, haue wrought no worke but [ill.] 171 ‚ÄúOh that mine eyes a fountaine weare of teares, That I might cleanse my sin-polluted soule, Or y? my dayes were like y? Eagles yeares, That with my age I might renewe my smarte, So should Repentance neuer from mee parte!‚Äù But oh, enough (faire Damsell), though y? skies Nor y? vast sea with water can suffice To purge our sin, yet faith from heauen biddes thee rise.‚Äù 172 So shee arrose, and by y? way heard tell, That Iesus with y? Pharise nowe sate: Thrice happy messenger, y? came so well, Such vnexpected tidinges to relate, And helpe a sinner in distress'd estate! Yet shee was daunted at y? Pharise, (For Pharises and sinners n'er agree, Though Pharises themselues, of s[i]nners cheefest bee). 173 A while shee pauzinge stood, and 'gan to doubt, Whither shee to y? Pharises should goe, Or rather for her Sauiour staye without; (Such men bee of austere regarde, wee knowe, And to y? vulgar make a goodly showe.) But other thoughts, to quell this care begin, ‚ÄúThe Pharise's a man, and men haue sin; Then, bee hee n'er so good, a better is within. 174 ‚ÄúA better is within, and hee so good, That howe maye I, polluted soule, come neare? Women defiled with a fluxe of blood, Maye not amonge y? hallowed appeare: I am vnclean, and leprous eu'ry where, How shall I then approach before his eye, More bright then is [y?] Eagle's, y? doth prie Into y? cabinets of deepest secrecy?‚Äî 175 ‚ÄúBut yet in mercy is his cheefe delight: Hee came to heale y? sicke, to saue y? lost; Hee cur'd 10 Lepres, gaue y? blinde y? sight, Feet to y? lame, life to y? nummed ghost, Speech to y? dumbe, and comforte to y? moste: And, which with prayse must euer bee confest, (Blest be y? time! his name for euer blest!) Seu'n sprights, with thunder hee ycharm'd from out my brest. 176 ‚ÄúCertes his loue will couer all my shame, And with his robe my errours I may hide: For I am sicke, lost, leprous, blinde, and lame, Dumbe, comforteles, and dead: nor is it pride, To seeke for helpe: then, what so'er betide, Thither I'l goe! if Christ once bidde me stay, The Pharise can neuer say mee nay: Oh, happy place, where heau'n hath placd another day!‚Äù 177 A boxe of costely odours shee pr√¶par'd, Odours t' anoynt th' anoynted from aboue, And with it streight to Simons house shee far'd, With true repentance to declare her loue: Shee brake it, and y? roome could soone approoue The fragrant smell: such is a contrite heart, That to y? heau'n sweet sauours doth impart, The oyntment of good workes, and p√¶nitence, ne'r parte. 178 Pr√¶pared thus, behinde his feet shee stood, Dissolu'd in teares of sweet (though bitter) brine, And with y? torrent of a Chrystall flood, Shee wash'd his feet, his iu'ry feet diuine, And then shee wip'd them with y? goulden twine Of her dissheuel'd haires: full many a kisse Shee gaue, and tooke; and, conscious of y? blisse, Her lippes waxt pale, for feare they had done ought amisse. 179 That falt, y? willinge maide will soon amend, For lauishely shee powres her oyntement sweet, (Though lauishely enough shee n'er could spend That which shee spent vpon his heau'nly feet:) So did her misery his mercy greet: Sweet was thy vnction (Mary), sweet thy kisse, But sweetest of all sweetes, thy teares (I-wis): The onely waye to heauen, by salt water is. 180 Happy wert thou to touch y? tressells bare Of thy beloued, heau'nly paramour, With eye, with hand, with temples, lippe and haire: Yet thrice more happy, sith thy Sauiour, With eye, heart, hand of faith thou didst adore: So doth a loue-sicke soule of best desarte, Desire to touch her louer in each part, And closely steale his body, y? hath stole her heart. 181 Oyntement shee mingles aye with bitter teares; Teares with sweet oyntement aye shee doth confound: No better balme in Gilead appeares, No sweeter smell in Lebanons rich ground: This saints y? sinner, makes y? sickest sound: Oyntement and teares (if true) to get her inne, First ope y? sluce, and shed teares for thy sin, Then to anoynt Christe's feet, with Magdalen begin. 182 Humility, lowe at his feet biddes stand; Behinde him, rosy-blushinge Modesty: Teares for his feet, Repentance doth commaund; And Selfe-Hate, with her haire biddes make them drie: Loue biddes her kisse, and Liberality Wills her to breake y? boxe, and oyntement powre. Hardenes of heart, pride, shamelesnesse before, Lust, luxury, selfe-loue, possess'd her thoughts of yore. 183 Mee thinkes, I see y? Damsell at her worke, While shee embalmes his feet with odours rare; With modest blush, howe shee hath learnt to lurke, And kisse his feet, his marble feet, so faire, And then to wipe them with her carelesse haire: Often her hands, often her lippes, came near[e]; Oft wipes shee of y? oyntement, y? I feare, The oyntement wanted sweet, his feet perfumed weare. 184 Yet sweet y? oyntement was, though sweeter farre The Nectar of his feet, with dewe besprent: So weake perfumes (though sweet) soone drowned are, If they bee mingled with a deper sent: Simons good cheare giues no such good content: His ghuests are frolicke with y? dainty meat; But shee delights y? brinish teares to eat, And ioyeth more in hers, then they in highest seat. 185 Some at feast haue crau'd thy company; But fewe or none, sweet oyntement for thee kept; Some haue anoynted, but fewe wip'd the[e] drie: Some wip'd thee drie; but wipinge, fewe haue wept; Beyond them all, kinde Magdalene hath stept: Some on thy head bestow'd y? charity, (Such was y? vse in auncient times,) but shee, Oyntinge thy feet, from toppe to toe anoynted thee. 186 O, that I might, with waueringe Thomas, dippe The finger of my faith within his side, Or heere with Magdalene obtaine a sippe, (Farre from my humble thought bee greater pride!) From out his feet, with pleasures beautified; What would hee giue for weepinge Maries place, Whose hermitinge humility could grace The Linnen cloutes, y? did our Sauiours wound embrace. 187 Faine would I leaue of Maries loue to writ[e], But still her loue y? will not let me leaue: In loue shee liu'd, and now with loues delight, Her former loue, y? did her eyes deceiue, In-stead of loue, of life shee doth bereaue: Faire mayde, redeemed from y? iawes of Hell, Howe hardly can I bidde thy loue fare-well! That which thou lou'st to doe, so doe I loue to tell. 188 The Pharis√¶ y? thought hee sawe, was blinde; The abiect sinner had the clearer eye; For thus hee reasoned within his minde; ‚ÄòWere this a Prophet, hee would soone descrie The wickednesse of her y? standes so nighe:‚Äô Thus hee coniectur'd, yet hee vtter'd nought: But his hypocrisie to light was brought; For well hee knewe her former life, y? knewe his thought. 189 Then hee begins her action to commend To Simon in a parable of debt, And sayes vnto him: ‚ÄúSeest thou her, my freind? Great is her loue, because her Sin is great: To washe my feet, no water hast thou set; But shee with teares hath washt them: on my head Thou hast not powred oyle: but shee, in-stead, With costly oyntement hath my feet be-sprinkeled. 190 ‚ÄúNo kisse thou gau'st mee for a kinde salute; But shee vnto my feet doth kisses giue: So her affection with her smiles doe sute: Thy sinns (sayth hee) are cleansd, and thou shalt liue: Goe hence in peace, sweete mayde! for euer thriue!‚Äù Wonder it is, y? hee, whose sacred might May call all prayse and glory, his by right, Should giue such heaunly prayse vnto a mortall wight. 191 Away shee went, aggladded at the heart, (Packe hence all sorrowe, let y? Damsell cheare!) Yet so, y? neuer from him shee would parte: And nowe her browe and cheekes began to cleare, And ioye displayd his banners eu'ry where; Now with a shole of Maries so deuout, Shee ministers, and deales her goods about, And followes her Leige-Lorde y? villages throughout. 192 Nowe on his rarest miracles shee gazeth, And with attention shee likes to heare, While hee y? lustre of his light eblazeth, And charmes with sacred eloquence each eare. So shee awaited still, both farre and neare, Till death approach'd, and hee inuaded Hell: But of his death, what should I further tell? Better maye hee that sange his birth, ringe out his knell. 193 Many a teare in Golgotha shee spent, To waile his torment and her owne distresse; And after, hied her to his monument, With odours sweet his wounded corps to dresse: In life shee lou'd him, and in death no lesse. The earth was clad with sable weeds of night When Magdalene, so full of rufull plight, Pr≈ìuents y? daye, and in y? darke seekes for her light. 194 O blessed woman, without Paragon, That couldst outrun (such is y? force of loue) The faithefull Peter and beloued Iohn, And bee y? first y? sawe y? stones remoue! This boone was graunted thee from heau'n aboue: But when shee could not finde his body there, Shee runs to them, and cries with piteous feare, ‚ÄúAye mee! my lord is gon! and layd, wee knowe not where.‚Äù 195 Iohn faster ran, but Peter farther went: Hee came vnto y? sepulehre, and stayd; The other entred in y? monument; But both out-stripped by y? weepinge mayde: They sawe y? linnen clothes and kercheife layd A-part: but shee, y? Angells first did viewe, As downe shee bow'd, in weeds of whitest hue. Poore Mary knewe not them, although they Mary knewe. 196 Shee drownes her-selfe in teares of saltest brine; They aske her, why shee weepes, and makes such mone: Shee sayes, ‚Äúmy Lorde is taken from this shrine;‚Äù And hauing sayd, shee spies her Lord alone; And yet to her, though seen, hee is not knowne: ‚ÄúWoman! (sayes hee) why makst thou such laments?‚Äù Shee aunswerd, ‚ÄúSir! if thou hast borne him hence, Tell mee but where hee lies, and I will fetch him thence.‚Äù 197 Shee thought her Lorde, y? gardiner had been: And keeper of a garden, sure, was hee: Yet no such garden, where dead sculls are seen, But Paradise, where pleasures euer bee, And blisse deriu'd from lifes aye-liuinge tree: Thither y? theife and he together went, And thither Mary must at length bee sent; But first y? dimme light of her life must needs bee spent. 198 Shee, to anoynt his breathlesse body came; With oyle of gladnesse hee, to oynt her head: To keepe him from corruption, was her ayme; His purpose was to raise her from y? dead. By name hee call'd her (happily shee sped!) To bee the messenger of heau'[n]ly newes, That gladdes the heart, and fadinge age renewes, And to y? Saints, thinges longe time vnreueiled shewes. 199 Awaye shee postes, all rauish'd with desire, And to y? Saints together met, shee hies: Her tidings make y? trobled soules admire; And yet her solace, and sweet obloquies, Make constant hope, and better thoughts arrise. Their prayses loud vp to y? heau'ns they send: Ioye closes all, (such ioye no style hath penn'd) So end I with y? ioye; ner may y? ioye haue end! ???? ?? ???.</field>
