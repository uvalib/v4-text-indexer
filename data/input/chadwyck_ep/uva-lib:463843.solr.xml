Ane sang of the Croce, and the frute thairof. Cvm heir sayis Goddis Sone to me Sinneris, that heuie ladin be, I will ?our sillie Saull refresche, Cum ?oung and auld baith man and wyfe I will ?ow giue Eternall lyfe, Thocht troublit heir sair be ?our flesche. My ?ok is sweit, my burding small, Quha drawis efter me thay sall Eschaip Eternall deid and fyre: For I sall help them in thair draucht, That thay sall cum as I haue taucht To gloir and Ioy, and heuin Impyre. Quhat I haue teichit lait and air, Quhat I hane tholit les and mair: That preis ?ow euer to fulfill And thocht ?our flesche be heir opprest, ?it all thing wirk sall for the best For sa is richt and Goddis will. The warld wald sauit be and faine, And cum to gloir but Croce or paine Quhilk Christis flock must suffer heir Bot paine thair is nane vther way, To cum to gloir, and put away Eternall hellis paine but peir. That the faithfull must the Croce Indure, Witnes beiris all creature, Subdewit vnto vanitie: Quha will not thoill in Christis Name, The Deuill sall wirk him sir ane schame?,? With peirles paine perpetuallie. To day ane man is fresche and fair, The morne he lyis seik and sair, Syne dulefully domeit to deid Euin lyke as in the feild ane flour The day is sweit, the morne is sour: Sa all this wretchit warld sall faid, The godles dreidis sair to die, Bot quhen he can na farther flee, And faine his sinfull lyfe wald mend Thay grip sa fast his geir to get, The sillie saull is quyte for?et. Quhill haistely gais out his aind. Quhen he persauis na remeid, Then greuously he gais to deid: And gruncheand geuis vp the Gaist, Sair I suspect God do accuse His Sectouris, and him self refuse. That sa vnfaithfully deceist. The riche man, helpis not his gude, The Nobill not his Royall blude, For thay sall baith thair quarrell tyne Thocht ane had all this warid sa wyde, ?it he sall die with dule and pyne, With golde and precious stanis of pryde. Knawledge concernis not the Clerk. Nor Hypocrite his haly wark: Bot thay but dout with deid mon dwell. Quha will not haill to Christ him giue Quhill in this present lyfe he liue, For euer mair sall die in hell. Mark weill thairfoir my Sonnis sweit, How Christis croce is for ?ow meit: O moue ?ow not in mynde thairfoir, Bot at his word stand steidfastlie, And with him suffer pacientlie, Gif ?e wald enter in his gloir. Do gude for euill, and leid ?our lyfe, Without reprufe, but pryde or stryfe, And thoill the warldis wraith to rage, O enter be that narow rod Giue gloir and vengeance vnto God, And he thair cruell Ire sall swage. Quhen that ?our flesche lies all the will? And may ?our lustis all fulfill, ?e ar but dout the feindis pray: God sendis ?ow the Croce thairfoir, To mortifie ?our flesche so foir, To saif ?our sillie Saull for ay. And quhen this schort paine to ?ow greif, Than think on hell the lang mischeif, Quhair mony ane for ay sall murne, And saull and body sall remaine, For euermoir with cruell paine, Endles for ay without returne. Bot he sall efter warldly pyne, Reioyce with Christ, withouttin fyne, Quhair na myndis memoriall Can think, nor toung can tell the tryne, Nor haue the gloir quhilk sall propyne, That michtie Lord vnto vs all, For quhat Eternall God of peace, Hes promeist throw his Spreit of grace, And syne sworne be his haly Name: That he sall hald baith trew and sune, God grant that we may se his Throne, Throw faith in Iesus Christ, Amen. Ane Consolatioun in aduersitie of the Scripture. Blissit is he quhome God dois correct, Thairfoir his scurge se thow not neglect: For he it is, quhilk geuis wan and wound, And suddanly he will mak haill and sound. He will the stryke with his maist fatherly wand, Syne the releue with his maist mercyfull hand. God will the slay, and giue the lyfe anone, And the returne, thocht thow to graue wer gone. And will the sone bring into pouertie, Syne giue the greit riches aboundantlie. He will the set into a law degre, Syne the exalt, that euerie man may se. Quhome God ressauis to his Sone and air. Him will he scurge with plagues sad and sair. Thairfoir vnder the Croce thow perseueir, Then as a Father sall God to the appeir. Quha is ane Sone, and will not pacientlie His Father thoill, with all humilitie, He schawis him as he wer bastard borne, And heritage fra him wer all forlorne. And sen that we our fleschely Father dreid. For eirdly thing our body for to feid, How mekill mair our Father Spirituall Suld we obey to lyfe perpetuall. All croce appeiris presently distres, Uoyde of all Ioy, bot full of painefulnes: Bot efterwart it sall giue peace and rest, Thocht for a tyme with paine we be opprest. The paine that is now present schort and licht And lestis bot a moment in our sicht, Aboue measure sall wirk Eternall gloir, In till our saull, behalding not thairfoir The present paine, quhilk is befoir our ene, Bot luke on that, quhilk now may not be sene All Ioy esteme, my brether ane and all, Quhen into diuers troublis ?e do fall, And knawis that of ?our faith it is a preif, To wirk in ?ow pacience for ?our releif. As of the Croce ?e ar compan?eoun, Sa sall ?e be of Consolatioun. Faithfull is God, and on ?ow hes pitie, And will not thoill ?ow temptit for to be, Aboue ?our strenth, bot will quhen ?e leist wene, Giue ?ow sic grace, that ?e sall weill sustene. Iust mennis lyfe is in the Lordis hand, Torment of deid may not them hald in band, Thocht befoir men thay thoill aduersitie, Thair hope is full of Immortalie. God knawis Innocentis temptatioun, To saif them fra thair greit vexatioun. And sall ressaue againe the latter day, The wickit for to burne in hell for ay. FINIS. The Forlorne Sone, as it is writtin in the xv. Chapter of Luk. Sinners vnto my sang aduert, Quhilk Christ into his Uangell kend, And from ?our sinfull lyfe conuert Quhairwith ?e do ?our God offend, For Christ in his sweit Parabill, To saif vs is full plyabill, Gif we repent and to him wend. Ane certaine man of riche substance Had Sonnes twa to him full deir, And sone with schort delyuerance, The ?oungest spak on this maneir: Father giue me my part of geir, Quhilk me belangis les and mair, I will na mair be thirlit heir. The father did his gude deuyde, Betuix them, bot the ?oungest sone Wald na mair with his father byde, Bot tuke his part, and furth is gone: In till ane strange and far countrie, And leuand thair richt ryatouslie He waistit all his geir anone. Quhen all was gone, thair rais fra hand Ane derth quhilk maid the vittell skant: Baith far and neir throw all the land, And he throw neid begouth to want: Then to ane Citi?enar he ?eid, Quhilk send him furth his swyne to feid, For falt of fude he was full faut. He wald haue eitin with the swyne, His houngrie stomak to fulfill: Bot thocht he suld for hounger tyne, ?it nane wald giue him leif thairtill, Quhen he come till him self againe, This him alone, he culd complaine, In till his mynde with mourning still. How mony seruandis for thair wage, Hes fude into my fatheris hous. And I for hounger die and rage, Bot my father is gracious, Thairfoir till him, I will me dres: And schaw my sin and my distres, And say with voyce full pitious. O Father I haue bene to bauld, Sinnand contrair the heuin and the, And not worthie that men me hauld, Na mair thy Sone in ony degre: As ane of thy seruandis me mak, With that he did his Iornay tak Hame till his father haistelie. And quhen he come bot ?it afar, His father had compassioun, And ran him till or he was war, And gaue him consolation, And in his armes he did him fang And euer he kissit him amang, With freindly Salutation?.? The sone said father of greit micht, I knaw that I haue sinnit soir: Contrair the heuin and thy sicht, And I am worthie now no more That ony me thy Sone suld call: Bot his father full liberall, Callit his seruandis him befoir: And kyndely to them can he say, ?e bring me furth the best clething, And cleith my Sone courtly and gay: And on his finger ?e put ane Ring, ?e set on schone vpon his feit, The quhilk ar trym and wounder meit, That he be honest in all thing. And slay that Calf quhilk now is maid Sa fat, and let vs mak gude cheir, For this my Sone the quhilk now was deid, Againe on lyfe is haill and feir, My Sone was loist, and now is found, And they within ane lytill stound Began to myrrie be but weir. The Eldest to the feild was gone, And quhen that he hame cummand wes: And hard the menstraly anone, The dansing and the great blyithnes, Ane of his seruandis he did call And said to him quhat menis all This glaidnes, and this merynes. Then answerit he and said him till Thy brother is cum hame againe, Thairfoir his father hes gart kill His weill fed Calf, and is full faine That saif ressauit him hes be, The Eldest wraith was and angrie, And ?eid not in throw greit disdaine: And then come furth his father kynde, And prayit him richt feruently, Bot he answerit richt proude in mynde, O father myne how lang haue I Thy trew and faithfull seruand bene: And neuer ?it brak thy biddene, Bot the obeyit faithfully. ?it gaue thow nocht of thy riches, Sa mekle as ane small Kyd to me, That I micht mak sum mirrynes And with my Lufaris blyith to be. Bot now becaus is cum againe Thy Sone quhilk waistit hes in vaine Thy gudis into harlatrie. That Calf quhilk fosterit was sa fair, Thow hes gart kill at his plesour, His father laid, my Sone and air, Of all my riches and treasour. Quhat euer I haue, all that is thyne, And thow art euer with me and myne, And all is haill into thy cure. Thairfoir to vs it was full meit For to reioyce, and blyith to be, With all our hart and all our Spreit, Thy brother saif and sound to se. For he was loist, and now is win, And he was deid from all his kin, And now aliue againe is he. Our God and father is full kynde, To sinneris that ar penitent, With all thair hart, and all thair mynde Schawand warkis that thay repent, And gif in Christis blude thay traist, Then sall he neuer them detest. Bot saif them that thay be not schent. FINIS. Ane sang of the riche Gluttoun and pure Lazarus, as it is writtin in the xv. Chapter of Sanct Luk. Faithfvl in Christ vse ?our riches richt, Not to ?our lust and Sensualitie: Bot all tyme help y? pure with all ?our micht For in the frute sall knawin be the tre And gude and euil sall baith rewardit be With heuinly gloir, and hell sa terrabill, To that effect spak Christ this parabill. Ane certaine man was riche, and coistly cled, With purpour, Sylk, heich, and presumpteous, And euerie day deliciously him fed, Thair was alswa a pure hecht Lazarus: Lay seik at the ?et of this gluttounis hous. Throw sairis smart he had ane peirles pyne, And wantit fude, quhen he wald fainest dyne. To satisfie his seikly appetyte, He wald haue eitin of the crummis small, Quhilk fell downe fra hie buird of greit delyte, Bot nane to gif him was sa liberall: The doggis did thair office naturall. And oft thay did this catyue man refresche: Likand the fylth furth of his laithly flesche. It chancit sa this begger did deceis, Syne caryit was be angels gracious In abrahams bosome, in heuinly rest and peace And this riche man that was sa Ryatous, Deceiffit als, syne buryit glorious, In hellis paine he lyftit vp his ene, And fyne afar of abraham hes he sene. Quhen Lazarus he saw with him also In his bosome, he said with drerie Spreit: Father Abraham haue mercy on my wo, Send Lazarus his finger for to weit, And cuill my toung with cauld water and sweit, For I am torment sair into this flame: Then answerit him our father abraham. Remember Sone, that thow ressauit hes, Into thy lyfe, thy plesure in all thing. And contrariwise Lazarus had distres, Bot now he is in Ioy and comforting, And thow art in wo and tormenting, And als betuix vs thair is sa greit ane space, That nane may cum till vther be na cace. And then he said O father, I the pray, Unto my fathers hous thow wald him send That he my fyue brether aduerteis may, Leist they into this cairfull place discend. Bot abraham said, let them repent and mend And als thay haue the Prophetis &amp; Moyses law Let them heir them, gif yai the way wald knaw. Bot he said nay, my father abraham kynde, Gif ony to the quick ?eid from the deid, Trewly thay suld repent with hart and mynde, Bot not the les abraham this answer maid, Gif thay heir not the Law quhilk suld them leid Then sall they nocht in ony wayis beleif Thocht ane suld ryse from deid them to releif. Unto the pure thairfoir be pietifull, Quhill ?e ar heir, schaw them ?our cheritie, Till freind and fa be all tyme mercyfull, As ?e forgiue ?e sall forgeuin be, Mortifie lust, and Sensualitie, Conforme ?ow not to wardly pomp and pryde, Dreid God, lufe man refraine lust at all tyde.

Siclyke he gaue them for to drink, In wyne his blude, the quhilk was sched, Upon his precious deid to think, On him remembrance to be maid. Quha eitis this blyssit Sacrament, Worthely with trew Intent Sall neuer se Eternall deid. For caus thay knew him till depart, Thay straif quha suld be ouerest: Bot Iesus said with humbill hart, Princes ar repute Nobilest, The quhilk rewlis maist awfullie, Sa amang ?ow it sall not be. Bot quha is maist sall serue the leist. Iesus wushe his apostillis feit, Schawand exempill of lawlynes. And chargit them with wordis sweit, That lufe amang them suld Incres, For thairby it suld cum to licht: That ?e ar my Discipulis richt, Giue ?e amang ?ow lufe posses, Efter this prayer passit he, And met the Iewes quhilk him socht, Quhen thay had bound him cruellie, Befoir the Iudges they him brocht. First they him scurgit, and for scorne, Him Crownit with ane Crowne of thorne, Syne dampnit him to deid for nocht. That Prince on Croce thay lyftit on hicht, For our Redemptioun that thocht sa lang, He said I thrist, with all my micht, To saue mankynde fra panis strang. He that all warldis was beforne, Come downe of Mary to be borne, For our trespas on croce he hang. Then he his heid culd Inclyne, As wrytis Iohne, and gaue the Gaist, And of the Croce tane was syne, And laid in graue bot sone in haist, Leuand he rais on the thrid day, And to his apostillis did say, To them appeirit maist and leist. And syne he did his apostillis teiche, Throw all the warld for topas. And till all Creature for to preiche, As they of him Instructit was. Quha Bapteist is, and will beleue, Eternall deid sall not them greue, Bot salbe sauit mair and les. Sanct Luk wryting his assentioun, Thocht present ay with vs he be, As Scripture makis mentioun.

For with the deuill and dulefull deid, With hell and sin I was forlorne: The sone of Ire at Goddis feid, Consauit sa I was and borne, I grew ay mair and mair thairin, And daylie eliue? sin to sin, Dispair was euer me beforne. Quhair I culd not the Law fulfill, My warkis maid me na supplie: Sa blind and waik was my fre will.
