      <field name="fulltext">Scribimus indocti, doctique poemata passim. Horatius. Sonnet. [To praise thy worth or to applaud thy wit] To praise thy worth or to applaud thy wit, Or to commend thy, pleasing Poetrie: Were but to shew my insufficiencie, Which cannot equall what thy selfe hast writ. for thou maist challenge not vnworthily, true Vertues merits, Fames eternitie, Vpon thy browes perpetually to sit. then what need I to laud thy Poesie, (which cannot pen thy praise effectuallie) Sith PhÅbus Laurell will eternize it. yet though thy owne deserts sufficient be, to praise thy selfe without my praising thee. My praise cannot disparage thee a whit, Yet since our friendship and our amitie. commaunded me as much: (and hee, Qui tua non laudat deteriora dabit) I haue aduentur'd, as each eye may see, to shame my selfe in seeking praise for thee. I. T. [Amongst the La?reats of these latter dayes] Amongst the La?reats of these latter dayes, and moderne Poetes of succeeded time: Whose well deseruing workes haue won them praise, why doest not thou aduenture for to clime. Which well deseru'st if I deserts may deeme, As much as some that are of more esteeme. Nay should I speake as simplie I suppose, thou merits more then manie of more yeares: For though thy workes, thy yet weake age disclose, yet in that weaknes there such worth appeares, That if thy subiet equalde but thy stile, All men would it commend, but none reuile. Yet though thy Subiect be indeed a toy, such as the grauest wittes regarde not much: Yet fits it with thy yeares, because a boy, youth-pleasing matters onely for to touch. But thy sweet stile as farre exceeds thy subiet, As beautie doth excell her basest obiect. Yet let not ones defect hide th'others glorie, but let ones worth enable th'others want: So shall each eie that haps to view thy storie, commend thy method, though thy matter skant, And with due praise applaud thy infant wit, Whose workes surpasse what some more olde haue writ. T. T. [Read what I write, and as thou readest, marke] Read what I write, and as thou readest, marke, whereto the purport of these lines do tend: Although that Aristarchus chaunce to barke, against this Poeme, which thou wel hast pend. Or misconceited Momus be offended, Against this poeme, which thou well hast ended. Regard thou neither them nor their obiections, but prosecute thy predisclosde intention: For squint-eied Zoilus seuere suggestions, cannot inueterate thy inuention. Not can the vpstart carpers of our time, Show reason to deride thy wel coucht rime. Then let the world be witnes of thy wit, and let the Printers profit be thy paine: That after-ages may admire thy writ, and Stationers applaud thee for their gaine. At so few yeares which hast a Poeme pend, Which pitch-mouth'd prowlers dare not discommend. And where thou didst in thy last letter showe, that oft affection blindes the readers eie: And therefore wisht if I did anie know, that would vouchsafe to read thy poetrie. That I should craue their censures in thy name, And send thee word how they allowed the fame. I here protest before the imperiall throne, of him that sits aboue the starrie skie: I send not vnto thee ones mind alone. but manies, that applaud thy poesie. And all conclude in one thy Muse to be, Sufficient to decore both her and thee. Then vse no more (sweet friend) at my intreat, such friuolous precrastinate delayes: But print this pamphlet, which in my conceit, for thy young yeares deserues an elders praise: Then put in print this Rape of Helena, Aut actumest de amicitia. The first Rape of faire HELLEN. Inopem me copia fecit. VVhen Ianiuere with frost had nipt the flowers, and Februarie spent his chil-cold dew: When March his blasts were turnd to Aprill showers, and pleasing-Maie gan change Dame Tellus hew. When Floras pride, had garnished the fieldes, With such sweet hearbs as Vers-Solstitiall yeelds. When Leucotheas siluer-shining light, obscur'd the perfect brightnesse of the day: When Vesperus the starre of Sable night, did her imperfect glimmering shine display. When that betwixt nights-darknes and dayes-brightnes There did appeare another-seeming likenes. VValking the woods to recreate my mind, (whom winters waste had welnigh made forlorne) Each thing was husht, still was the muttering wind, and Prognos sister perched on a thorne. Contemning sleep, though other birds were sleeping, Gan carroll foorth her woes in bird-like weeping. Thus for my pleasure walking as I went, I saw a Maid (a Maiden in attire) With haires disheueld, eyes with tears besprent, which when I saw, I hasted to draw nier. That I at ease might heare her cause of woe. And briefly thus she gan her cause to showe. Ye Siluane shrubs, whose branches gins to bloome: bend downe your boughs to entertaine my groning: Ye springing hearbs that sprout by Cloris doome, vouchsafe a while to heare my cause of moning, You beasts &amp; birds that mongst these boughs are sleeping Desist from sleepe, to sorrow at my weeping. I was Helena, erst dame Natures woonder, the trothlesse daughter of king Tindarus: Beloued mate till lust did cause me sunder, of Spartas king, praise worthy Menalaus. Castor &amp; Pollux, those two twinning brothers, Were sonnes of Leda, she was al our mothers. Thus was I made a Princesse by discent, and faire I was, the only gift of Nature: Ne lackt I ought that might the same augment, but liued for a while a happie creature. Till Fame the causer of ensuing shame, From furthest coasts did bruite abroad my name, For eight score moneths almost I liu'd a maide, free from all sinnes if free from selfe-conceit: Subiect to none, of all almost obay'd, I slept secure, as free from Loues deceit. But when to riper yeares I had attained, That thing betide, that me oft after pained. For when that I by heauens permission, grew fit for that, that best fits maides desire, I meane when I gain'd manumission, of childish bondage to my carefull sire. That thing did chance which to my endlesse woe, I am enforst vnto the world to show. Yet sinnes-deserued shame ere I begin, bids leaue abruptlie, and let no more know it, But since I liuing neuer fear'd to sinne, why being dead, should I be sham'd to showe it. No sith I liuing neuer sham'd to act it, Now being dead, I will in shame detect it. No sooner had false eare-delighting Fame, made knowne my beautie, Natures ornament: The only cause of my abortiue blame, to be not common, but most excellent. For loue, or lust, or both I know not whether, But many millions still resorted hither. Looke how in Hybla hunnie-sucking Bees, when PhÅbus shines, forsake their hiued bowers Lothing to touch desembling Alpine trees, doe cling together on the fairest flowers: So came ennobled wights in generall, To view my beauty, that surpassed all. Lordes of esteeme, and knightes of high degree, came first to see, and after to be sped: Others that were not of like dignitie, came neither for to woe not yet to wed. But vnder token of their loue or dutie, Of purpose came to see my matchlesse beautie. Mongst whom first cause of my first caused care, came the Athenian Duke, Egeus heire. Who for he heard no one might make compare, with me, which was esteem'd the only faire. Came to my fathers pallace, not to wooe me, But as I thinke, as destin'd to vndoo me. For he no sooner had obtainde a view, of my surpassing common comlinesse: But he ex tempore began to sue to gaine through me loues fained happinesse. He su'd and seru'd, no loue phrase was vnused, That might haue gaind what he would haue abused. My loue it was he would so faine haue gained, my loue it was that he so ill deserued: For though his heart with Lechers lust were pained, yet he alonely ought to haue reserued His faith to whom his faith he erst did plight, And not her faith disloyallie to quight. But he disloyal, false and treacherous, vnkind, vnconstant, and vncurteous: Luxurious, lustfull, and most lecherous, vntrue, vngratefull, vile, and vicious. In wedlocke, friendship and to chastitie, Did prosequute his suit vncessantlie. The metamorphisde childe of Inachus, transformde by Ioue through Iunos ielousie: Grazing vpon the bankes of Alpheus, was neuer watched halfe so narrowly, By olde Aristoes hundred-eyed child, As I was watcht by him to be beguild. Oft nam'd he loue, but then he thought of lust, oft nam'd he fancy, meaning lechery: Oft he desired me his faith to trust, when that his truth proou'd trothlesse treacherie. Yet I not knowing lust, too yoong to loue, Could neither fancie nor affection prooue. Thus much I told him, and so much he knew, but nought auailde my telling, or his knowing: Sith that he neuer did desist to sue, but at conuenient houres would still be wooing. And with such we thewd wordes he me assailed, That if I had knowne Loue, he had preuailed. At length when that he saw he su'd in vaine, and that my yeares deny'd to yeeld compassion: When he perceiu'd it booted not complaine, because my youth deny'd to ease his passion. He left to woo, although his fancie flamed, And outwardlie made showe to be reclamed. He fram'd his lookes as free from fancies fire, his countenance was buxome to the sight: So cunningly he cloked his desire, that I supposde his heat was altered quight. But though his hearts ill thought he thus did smother, Chaunce to my care at length did it discouer. For when alone one day he chaunc'd me see, careleslie walking on the sandie shore: And seeing no wight neere my helpe to be, he neuer staid as he was woont before. To plead for pittie to the pittilesse, Or aske for mercie of the mercilesse. But thinking fortune fauour'd his intent, because he me so hapleslie did meete: Iudging nought then his purpose could preuent, except it were the swiftnesse of my feet. (Which dreading nought his ill intent in running, Hasted not thence but rested till his comming.) What with the swiftnesse of his hastned pace, and the sharp spurre of his enflam'd desire: At length he did attaine vnto the place, where first brake foorth his sparks of hidden fire. (For he did it while then so slylie cloake, That there might be perceiu'd, nor flame, nor smoke? Breathlesse at first he set him by my side, panting he striueth for to gather wind: And for a while doth dum and speachlesse bide, thus breathlesse, faint and speechlesse he can find Nor wind, nor strength, nor words to act his will, Vntill that he reuiu'd by sitting still. But when his wind was well recouered, his faintnes gone &amp; his lost speech regained, His hearts il-tent he openly discouered, leauing his Knighthood &amp; my chast name stained. Making himselfe cause of my infamie, And me the subiect of his tyrannie. To shew the manner of his motions, or manifest his monster like misusing, Were vaine: sufficeth it his actions, did only tend vnto my faire, abusing. For as his Gransire vsde Amymone, So tyrant like this traytor vsed me. He suckt the sweet &amp; let me keep the sowre, He pluckt the blossome and left me the braunch, I had the stalke, he stole away the floure, wherewith his marrow-fretting lust to staunch. He forc'd my flesh his fancie to fulfill. He hath his wish by force without my will, His wish thus ended and my woe begun, away he posteth, leauing me alone: Shaming as seem'd the shame that he had done, and grieu'd to heare my hearts excessiue mone. Whilst I exclaiming on this cursed fact, Made my hands means my beauties harmes to act, My beautie cause of this my forced harme, I painted with the piercing of my nayles: My head of her attyre I did disarme: and with my hands my haires like foes assayles, Pulling them of from off my naked head, Whose purple gore did staine white beautie red. My scalding sighes, my woes interpreters, flew foorth like vapours rising from the floods: My sounding outcries, harts swift messengers, burst foorth like Ecchoes from the hollow woods. Whilst that my teares, true seruants to my paine, Fell from mine eies lik drops of Aprill raine. My tongue true tennant of my troubled thought, burst foorth in bitter banning my bad burden: Wishing that he whose worke my wracke had wrought (that Lerna-like lasciuious lustfull Lurden) Which suckt my sweet, might succourlesse sustaine, Perpetually perpetuall pining paine. Thus actuallie my actuall Arteries, did signify my sorrowes simpathie: My head, handes, haires, voice-moouing tongue &amp; eyes, do manifest their mutuall miserie. Making the wind a witnesse of my woe, Which Eccho-like when that I sigh'd did blowe. My haire disheueld hanging ore mine eies, made day seeme darknesse darker then the night, VVhich made me thinke that Vesta through my cries, of pittie purposelie obscur'd the light. That while my eyes their course in woe were keeping, One eie might not beholde the tothers weeping. But when that PhÅbus in his VVest decline, shone through my Amber lockes vpon my face: I then suspected that the Sun did shine, of purpose to discouer my disgrace. VVhen for because my face he should not see, I closely coucht my head vpon my knee. Then ay desiring nights obscuritie, with duskie cloudes to dimme the firmament, I neuer ceast my woes extremitie, nor yeelded leasure to my languishment. But made the rockes reporters of my gronings, And waters witnesse of my sicke soules monings. VVhilst Caitiffe he came to my fathers court, prepareth presently to poast away: Coyning excuses in such cunning sort, that none suspected, but he could not stay: No more he could in deed, for sinne so vrgde him, That he durst staie no more, least shame shuld scurdge him. Eache thing prepared for this hastie Deuill, away he posteth with celeritie: When Tindarus suspecting nought the euill, that he had proffered my virginitie: Associates him in kindnesse on the way, Whose lust of late had wrought his childes decay. In all this time my father neuer mist me, little suspecting my recountlesse care: He rather iudg'd me for my sport to be, rousing the Bucke, or coursing of the Hare. Then in this Sandy desert all alone. Hopelesse and helplesse, to recount my mone. But when dim clowdes, the enemies to light, had ouershadowed the element: And twinckling stars, the Sunnes of sable night had tane possession in the firmament. Then Tindarus gan misse my company, And to suspect some traitors tyrannie. He gins suspect, but what he cannot tell, he doubts the worst, but knows not what it is He feareth that his daughter is not well, yet cannot iudge wherein she is amis, Now feares he this, now that, but all is one, What he shuld most haue feard, is yet vnknown. Himselfe too soone to seeke me he doth hie, and yet too late to find his maiden-child: For she is changed to her contrarie, and her chast name with vnchast act delfilde. I was a maide, my maidenhead is lost, Then they in vaine to seeke a maiden poste. But all this while poore I sate discontent, wishing the cloudes the messengers of night Would haste to send the day to banishment, and duskie mystes would ouerwhelme the light. That I vnseene to chamber couertlie, Might bring my selfe through darknes secrecie. When heauing vp my head from off my knee, whereon while now it had continued: Seeing the Moone in PhÅbus place to be, lending the light which she of late renewed. Who palely shining gaue no perfect light, But each thing was obscurde by obscure night. Then gan new sorrow vexe my soules salt taste, and vncoth passions to assaile my heart: When weying present paine with pleasure past, my forepast solace with my feeling smart. My hoarse-growne voice a fresh began to mutter, And to the senceles rockes new sorrowes vtter. I curst the night, conceiler of my shame, because it represented Hellens woes: I curst the day, the enemy to blame, for feare it would my rauishment disclose, I curst them both, for they did represent My honour past, and my dishonour present. I iudg'd the glorious day to represent ths Sun-shine glory of my pristine state: The night resembled my foule rauishment, the onlie subiect of my soules debate, For as the day was darkened by the night, So Hellens rape eclipst her honours light. Thus sate I still charactering my crosse, cursing the cause of my calamity: Continually bemoning my soules losse, the pricelesse losse of my virginity. Wishing that death to end my miserie, Would now begin to act my tragedie. But when that venus in her region, had past the Tiptick in he Zodiack. And PhÅbe left in this our Horizon, to lend her light when all the aire was black With cole-black clouds, that darkt the firmament, And that no Starre was in the Element. Then I began to descant what was best, in haste to hie me to my Fathers Court, And to explaine to him my soules vnrest, or els thereof to none to make report. Or like an exile euermore to be, And kin or countrey neuer more to see. But when I had debated on these three, which would be best to cloak my crased name I iudg'd it most conuenient to bee, back to returne, but not to show my shame To any one, but whom I knew would be Faithfull in counsell and in secrecie. This thus descided and concluded on, backe I returned to Laconia: Whereas my parentes mutually did mone, the too long absence of their Hellena, Wherto at length when that I had attained, Passions anew poore passion'd Hellen pained. For then remembring how from thence I came, a maid in substance, show, in word and weed: And now return'd to my perpetuall shame, A Virgin but in show and none in deed. Bearing the loade of lust that Theseus left me, And wanting that whereof he had bereft me. My brinish teares began to fill anew, the hollow seats of my half drowned eies: My sorrowes signes, like mysty vapours flew, making the aire to ecchoe with my cries. Ne'er discontinuing my continued cares, Vntill I came vnto my chamber staires. Which I ascending, found my chamber lockt, my windowes closed, and my women sleeping: Where with my finger whilst I softly knockt, my tear bleard eies a fresh burst out a weeping. And my hearts herrald made such mickle moning, That they which slept were waked with my groning. Who suddenly awaked with the noise, were sore affrighted with my sudden cries: And well perceiuing that the dolefull voice, vnder their chamber window did arise. Fearing as seem'd some daunger that might hap, Closely themselues in their bed-clothes they wrap. Like as the Ostrich in a showre of rain, if he can get a bush to hide his head: Supposeth that his plumes vnwet remaine, so they thus closely shrowded in their bed, Thought themselues safe from whatsome'er might fall, Although no safetie were therein at all. At length I cride to let their mistresse in, but crie I, call I, do I what I will: My cries and calles they force not of a pin, for though I crie or call, they rest them still. Till one more bolde then th'other, said sheed trie, Both who, and what I was, that thus did cry. Wherewith she lightly leapeth from her bed, casting a slender mantle o'er her backe: The chamber dore she had not opened, before she askt of me what I did lacke. When I halfe smiling at her simple feare, Bid her a while her question to forbeare. Till that the dore were ope, and I were in, wherewith as seemd, she knowing it was I: Loth any more through ignoraunce to sin, she opes the dore: and with lowe curtesie Crau'd pardon for her forepast ignorance, Which causde her perpetrate so foule offence. I being in, she sought to find a light, But I bad her to let the light alone: For why, I thought the darknes was too bright, for her whose heart was ouewhelm'd with mone. And bad her leauing me to hie to rest, For solitarie thoughts fit sorrow best. But she a while most maidenlie did pause, musing from whence should spring this alteration, Yet would not seeme for to demaund the cause least she might mooue my indignation. But like a modest maiden mute she stands, Whilst weeping I sate wringing of my hands. I wept to thinke vpon my wofull fall, she weeps to see her Mistresse male content Sighes flie from me: teares from her eies doe fall, yet neither knoweth th'others languishment. Thus in our teares there was a simpathie, Yet neither knew th'others reason why, At length I sighing might perceiue her Eccho, and in her ecchoing to giue two for one: Which made me meruaille at her sudden sorrow, and to demaund of her her cause of mone. The soone repilde: you know the reason why Your selfe doe weep, for that same cause weep I. When I supposed, hearing her say so, that These us had harm'd both her and me: And so to both had geuen one cause of woe, and not that one had causde boths misery. Which so afresh did gall my fore galde wound, That in a traunce I suncke vnto the ground. Poore Clemence (so my maid was cald) with speed, pittying my case yet ignorant to aide me: Discloseth to the rest their Ladies need, who hasting thither sundry waies assaid me. So bring againe, but doe they what they may, Dead still lie I as colde, as liquid clay. They stop my wind my garments they vnlose, they bend my ioints they rub my naked skin: They hold strong-senting sauours to my nose, they warme my bed, and lay me warme therein. And sundry times each seuerall way they trie, But as I did, so dead continued I. At length it was concluded by consent, to giue my parents notice of my woe: And vnto them they send incontinent, one that to them their daughters harme might show. Who hauing notice of my present need, Made no delay, but came to me with speed. They come, and finding me nor liue, nor dead, but between both and so not perfect one: Were at the first so sore astonished, that still they stood like to a sencelesse stone. Till that my life was perfectly recouered, And my soules breath my liues suruiue discouered, Then Tindarus (his cheeks bedew'd with tears,) came louingly and tooke me in his armes: Crying faire daughter comfort of my yeares, who is the causer of these causelesse harmes. Or whence proceeds the ground worke of thy woe, Speake (louely daughter) let thy father know. If thou be crasde by any maladie, Ile craue the counsell of Physitions: By whose aduise Ile find a remedie, to ease the burden of thy passions. If any one in ought haue inuiur'd thee, I vow at full thou shalt reuenged be. Then speak sweet child, demonstrate to thy Sire, from whence proceeds this vnaccustom'd change: The smoking sighes of thy soule-sorrowing fire, do seeme vnto thy parents verie strange. Then explicate to me thy sick soules griefe, That I may lend to thee some wisht reliefe. Thus cries he to me, but I rested dum, thus did he call but I remained mute: Thus praid he, but my tongue was tipt with mum, so that my speech could not obey his suite. For crie he, call he, pray he, al's in vaine, Nor prayers, cries, nor calles, their wish can gaine. When he vnable more to to contemplate the sencelesse substance of his speechlesse daughter: With soules swolne sorrow grieuing at my fate, and eies repleat with drops of teare-falne water. He parteth speechlesse, speechles leauing me, For sorrow speechlesse made vs both to be. He gone, my mother with the like lament, (making her proem with a signe of woe) Desires me to declare my discontent, and vnto her my cause of sorrow showe. And not my sorrow with selfe wil to double, But ease my care with showing of my trouble. Show me (quoth she) thy soules concealed smart, and let me knowe the cause of thy complaints: That I in teares with thee may beare a part, to ease thy burdned hart before it faints. And not by cloaking it thy sorrow keep, For sorrow wasts in teares where many weep. This while sate she still looking on my face, expecting answere from a speachlesse creature. But shame had seald my lips with soules disgrace, so that I could not vse the gift of nature. Yet my obedience did commaund me speake, But dutie could not shames tongue-tying breake. At length my tongue, cares catarr did dissolue, in hope to her my torment to disclose. But when my speech should show my tongues resolue, It had no sound but sighes, true words of woes. Whereby my mother gathered to her sorrow, That tong his speech nor speech his voice could borrow. When with her eies brimful of brinish water, and soule imprinted with sowre-sorrowes seale: She would haue said, adue distressed daughter, but griefe enforc'd her speech that to conceale. And as she me behind her speechlesse left, So she departed of her speech bereft. She being gone supposing no wight neere me, the chamber being void of company: That whatsoe'er I should report, might heare me, I gan in cursing Theseus tyranny, To memorize my memorable mone, And to reueale what I would not haue knowne. Meane while on th'one side Learna, LÃ¦das Nurse, heard me at length disclose my discontent: One th'other side my Nurse heard me discourse, the means and maner of my rauishment. And iointly heard my seuerall exclaiming, On him that was the cause of my complaining. Thus heard they me, I them nor sawe, nor heard, vntill they both vnto me did appeare: And did disclose the thing that I so feard, that any other but my selfe should heare. Which would haue made my anguish more to be, But that they promist for to succour me. Daughter (quoth one) I heard thy soules lament, the which at once both gals and glads my heart: Gals for to thinke vpon thy rauishment, glads that I know wherein to ease thy smart, If that you will not my good will despise, But follow counsel as I shal aduise. Wherewith I looking gastlie on her face, did aske the Beldame, if she did not dote: That said she could remedie my disgrace, whose infamie was euen now aflote As if she knewe that my Virginitie, Once being lost, could reobtained be. Daughter (quoth she) I pray thee be content. harme not thy selfe with incredulitie: I would not wish thee thinke it my entent, to flout thee with impossibility. But to disclose what shall be for thy weale, If thou wilt daine to let me it reueale. Who may &amp; will not gentle Nurse (quoth I) haue ease of paine, deserues to feele the smart: Then if that I a proffered helpe should flie, my paine would only counteruaile desart. But since remedilesse I iudge it be, Pardon (sweet Nurse) my incredulitie. Yet for I will not scorne an olde wiues worde. Ile gladly heare what thou shalt gently showe: And though I feare that age cannot affoord, the meanes to mittigate my mickle woe. I will attend the end of thy report, For though it help not, it can doe no hurt. Then child (quoth she) giue eare vnto thy Nurse, and hearken to my speech without disdaine: Thy formall person's ne'er a whit the worse, although Virginity haue had a staine. A maime which though it cannot cured be, It may be greatly easde by secrecie. Had not thy selfe disclosde thine owne disgrace, which way should she or I haue knowne the same: Shame hath not charactered vpon thy face, that thy transgressions haue deserued blame. Nor can the world suspitiously suppose, Except thy selfe will thy ill hap disclose. Each thing you know is not as it doth seeme, all are not Schollers that haue School-mens bookes: Each thing that glistereth gold we must not deeme, nor all those Vestals, that haue Vesta's lookes. Ere thou wert borne, and after thou art dead, The'ill looke like maides, that haue no mayden-head. Virginitie, Maides chiefe accounted treasure, fenc'd so preciselie in the worlds quicke eie: Is kept with mickle paine, and lost in pleasure, and yet is cloak'd so close with secrecie, That few can see't except by some ill chance, A Timpany disclose theyr slie-stolne dance. Hellen need not feare that, she is too yoong, to breed or beare a bastard for this rape: Thy bellie cannot manifest thy wrong, nor make the world a witnes of thy scape, For why? the world will neuer once mistrust, Thy tender yeares to be defilde by lust. Yet say the world engender ill suspect, suspect, false feare, false feare, foule ielousie: And Ielousie by triall doe detect, the too soone losse of thy Virginitie. What can they censure of thy rauishment, Since thousands are in worse predicarment. Hadst thou consented to his villanie, or willinglie subiected to his will: Thou mightest then haue feard thy obloquie, but since by force he did performe thy ill: Blamelesse thou art although thou blotted be, Yet if thou blab not, none this blot can see. Wert thou the first that hadst by lust bin raped, as thou art not by thousands of our sect: Should none but thou hereafter be priaped, th? mightst thou wel deplore thy names defect But sith thou art nor first, nor last, but one, Cloake it with secrecy, and end thy mone. Oh Nurse (quoth I) you daunce without the ring, you misse the marke whereat you bend your leuell: Your f[illeg.]ed fables can no plaister bring, to mittigate the furie of my euill. Your wordes are weake, and want efficacie, To extirpate Hellenas malladie. Counsell may comfort cares Catastrophe, and lenigate a light conceiued griefe: But wordes vnto my woes extremitie, can neither comfort render, nor reliefe. Then holde thy peace good Nurse and say no more, Thy words want strength to search my sorrowes sore. Then child (quoth Lerna) marke attentiuely, what I to thee aduisedly dilate: And thou shalt see by proofe that secrecie, is the' onlie plaister for thy pouirsht state, And that the matter of small moment is. Which thou supposest to be so amisse. Thou thinks (quoth she) &amp; yet thou art deceiu'd, King Tindarus thy lawfull Sire to be: But truth it is thy mother hath receiu'd a harme vnknowne to all but her and me. For she (enforc'd) thy father hath cornuted, Which (for vnknowne) she is for true reputed. And thus it channst, one day as she was woont, while she did bath her Alablaster limmes, Within the water of a Christall foont, adowne the streame a milke white Swan there swims Hasting vnto the place where she did bathe And this same Swan did worke thy mothers skath. For Ioue conuerted to this seeming Swanne, came thus of purpose to supplant thy mother: To whom in likenesse both of God and man, he oft before attempted to discouer. How much he longed at her hand to reape, What faith and dutie did commaund to keepe. No sooner had this God resembling-Swanne, come to the place wher she did bathing stand: But that his misbeseeming actions gan to giue thy mother for to vnderstand, That this Swans shape that shrouded Deity, Was but a shift to cloke impiety. Wherefore she sought to scape vnto the sands, but Ioue did intercept her in her flights And when the weak are in the strongers handes, right must perforce be mastered by might, So she enforc'd, perforce must yeeld to force, Which he extends on her without remorce. Now he discloseth that his feathered plumes, are God in substance, though a Swan in showe, For proofe whereof, to him he reassumes his pristine shape wherein he workes her woe: For though he counterfeits a feathered weed, In his owne shape he doth a deuillish deed. His lust he eased and displeasde thy mother, and got foure twins, whereof thy selfe art one: Castor, Pollux, and thy sister's th'other, and yet thy mother keeping it vnknowne, The King supposeth you his owne to be, Although your mother knowes the contrarie. Thus may you see your mother hath receiu'd a harme exceeding yours, yet kept vnknowne: Vnknowne to him her husband is deceiu'd, because he thinks her children are his owne. And yet she cloakes this with such secrecie, That none mistrusteth her inconstancie. Diuers there are vnknowne, that in like case, doe beare the burthen of a Cuckold skorne: Yet if that none do them in words disgrace, they neuer feare the wearing of the horne. For were the word no greater then the weight, Few would mistrust their too kind wiues deceight. Diuers likewise contented are, vnknowne, to take an others leauings in their loue: And keepe the nest, the birds whereof are flowne. and not suspect what triall true would prooue, Yet as they ought by dutie loue their wiues, Suspecting nothing their fore-passed liues. Amongst the first thy long-supposed father, doth weare what if he knew would grieue him sore, Amongst the last who think'st thy Rose to gather, will be deceiu'd, because t'was stolne before. Yet will not fear't, if thou vse secrecie, For why the blind deuoureth many a flie. Then be thou secret in thy actions, blab not abroad thy vertues forc'd defect: But silentlie so smother passions, that neither aire nor Eccho may detect. Thy sicke-soules sorrowe so with silencie, Thou maist keepe secrete thy impuritie. These and such like patheticall perswades, which Lerna vsde wrought so effectuallie, That my sad countenanc'd sorrow-seeming shades, were chang'd, and my sights-agents actuallie, Did manifest my sorrowes banishment, And my release from pristine languishment. Yet for I would not seeme so soone to ende, what I had erst so earnestlie begun: (Faining as though sleeps-waight my liddes did bend, and drowsinesse my sences had o'er-run. I did entreat them leauing me alone, To voide the chamber quickly and be gone. When they departing left me to my will, with whose departure I did leaue to weep, And ruminated how my hidden ill, with silency I might in secrete keepe. For why? I fear'd mine owne fragilitie, Because few women can vse secrecie. Silence in Femals is a speciall gift, and secrecie a vertue in that kind: But their deliuery now is growne so swift, that silence in that sect is hard to find. For talke they will and when their tongues are walking, Their secretes are disclosed in their talking. Thus did I feare my imbecility, nor did I feare without occasion: For when the image of obscurity. was vanisht from the airy region, And Leucothea her crepundiat light, Had driuen aires-obscuring clouds to flight. Then Clytemnestra came to visite me, to whom vpon demaund I did disclose, (Vnable longer to vse secrecie) The hatefull ground-work of my haplesse woes: Letting her know what I should keepe vnknowne, Crauing her silence, that forget mine owne. When she as I was, and all women be, too weake to worke the trust in them reposed: (Though I entreated her the contrarie) yet to another she my harme disclosed. And so from me to her, from her to other, At length it was disclosed to my mother. Who grieu'd to heare her daughters detriment, yet glad y came to counterchecke my care: Commaunding me to stint my drirement, cease my complaint and abrogate dispaire, Wishing me hide my cause of misery, And she had means to ease my malladie. This day are come Ambassadors (quoth she) from Sparta's King vnto Laconia, To treat a match betwixt himselfe and thee, because he likes thy beauties Idea, Now if thou yeeld consent his wife to be, Thou maist be freed from future obloquie. Then cast away this care-containing cloude, which so obscureth thy tralucent glory: Suffer not Sorrow in these eies to shroud, wherin each eie may read faire beauties story But as thou art my daughter, do thy dutie, Decrease thy sorrow and encrease thy beautie. Looke how the raine reflecting Element, obscures the splendor of Apollos shine: So doth this beautie clouding drirement, eclipse the glorie of these looks of thine. This cloudie countenanc'd campe of carefulnes Doth ouershade this seat of comelinesse. Take but this small prospectiue instrument, wherein thou maist beholde thy phisnomie: There if thou marke what great disparagement, thy bewty reapeth by this agonie. Thou wilt desist to entertaine that thing, That to thy fauour such disfigures bring. How these my woes interpreters (quoth I) taking the mirrour from my mothers handes Doe staine the collour of my borrowed die, I neither know, nor care to vnderstand Only this thing assuredlie I know, My aduerse fortune doth exceede my woe. Yet for I will not disobey your will, nor vse too obstinate austeritie: I will in shewe so ouershade my ill, that none shall iumpe at my extremitie. Then doe (sweet mother) what you shall thinke best, Hellens content to yeeld to your behest. She inlie glad to heare of my consent, doth outwardlie in open showe reioce: Telling the King her daughter was content, obediently t'allow her fathers choice. Who likewise ioying my recouerie, Doth to the Legates make discouerie. Of his concording with his childes consent, to make their Lord the Lord of his desire: Wherewith well pleasde away the Legate went, lauding the choice of my supposed Sire, To showe their Soueraigne their succesfull speed, Whom well they know would munerate their meed. Whilst I discarding my decreased dolour, forgot the forepast feare of my offence: And only studied how to get that collour, which melancholy had exiled hence. From these wan cheekes, without whose rosall staine. I could not the true type of beauty gaine. Looke what by Arte, or nature could be thought, powerfull to pollish my late perish'd plumes. Was neither left vnvalued, nor vnbought. till what by diets, paintings, and perfumes, My beautie of her blemish was depriued, And my so late collour was reuiued. Then as the wearer of poore Argus eies, doth vaunt his proud plumes in his maiestie: Yet when his Prides ill-pleasing legges he spies, he falles his plumes, and vailes his royaltie. Shaming as seemes, his plumes with collours graced Should be with such disgracing legges defaced. So did I flaunt in new-found fond disguise, (such as at this day court attenders weare: When with newfangles they Idolatrize the banckrout beautie of their borrowed haire.) Such did I weare, although I needed none, My beauty lackt no blazon but her owne. Yet when I thought I was in highest pleasure, and my thoughts pleasure in the highest rate: If I but thought of my so late lost treasure, it would my present pleasure so amate, That as the Peacoks legs doe bate his pride, So do my losse my liues contentment hide. But as still calmes, stormes-furie mittigate, when Eolus encageth boisterous winds: So tract of time at length did lenigate the aduerse-abstract of my awfull mind. Making the cloudy lookes of my soules sorrow, Through my hearts-pleasing news new looks to borrow For Menalaus long look'd for, comes at last, to take possession of his promisde mate: By whose approch the cloudie ouercaste, that did my beautie so inueterate, Did flie as vapours flit before the Sun, And my sighes ended, when his sight begun. The weather-beaten wearie Marriners, when from the top the boy descries the shore: Nor ouer-iournied sicklie passengers, come to their iournies end, reioyce not more. Then I reioyced at his wisht approch, Whose countenance must shield me from reproch. His presence doth exhilerate my spright, my presence is his ioyes felicity: He is my comfort, I am his delight, thus in our actions seem'd a simpathie. Each others presence ioying mutuallie, Though in our ioyes were contrarietie. His ioy proceeded of the ardent zeale, his fancie bare to my eie-pleasing face: My ioy because I hop'd his loue would heale, the secrete wound of my scarce-known disgrace, His, for he hop'd to haue me to his wife, Mine, for I knew his loue would end my strife. Whilst in these aduerse motions of the mind, we equallie enioyd our hearts desire: Prince Agamemnon doth like solace find, for he had gained licence of my Sire To marrie Clitemnestra, whose consent, Causd him participate the like content. Then we all foure expected for one day, to consumate with tongue what hart had tide. Houre-stealing time doth softly slide away, and that long wisht for houre quicklie hide. Wherein each one might reape his wisht desire, Though Hellen lackt what dutie did require. I wanted that, that beautifies a maide, which makes their vertues equall with their beautie. I lackt that blossome which will neuer fade, if lust do not exceed the bounds of dutie. I wanted the true type of chastity, Because a traytor wrongd Virginitie. But twas sufficient that my face was faire, and that suffiz'd to satisfie his mind: My vertues losse did not my beaut'impaire, perfection so did his affection blind. That he would not my imperfection see, But with all faults was glad to marrie me. The day is past that we so long desir'd, and I am maried, that before was mard: Titan to bathe in Thetis bower retir'd, and night attended by her Sable guard, Did send that houre, wherein the Spartan thought, To crop that bud, a thiefe by force had caught. But what I knew he did not once suspect, what he suspected not, I did not showe: And what I show'd not, nothing could detect, so much I knew: my mother told me so. Thus Mariage made a metamorphoses, Of his vnrest, and my vnhappines. It gain'd me one, to warrantize my will, a cloake to shroude me from each stormie shower It got him one his fancie to fulfill, whose outward sweet did salue each inward sower. Our copulation made vs mutually, Prooue in our mirths a perfect simpathy. But now I must forsake Laconia for Menalaus wil to Sparta go: Prince Agamemnon wil to Micya, and I and Clytemnestra must do so. For they c?mand to whom we must obay. Our duties disalow'd vs to say nay. Then being parted from my parentes sight, the place wherein my passions most did flame: Each heart-enthralling paine was put to flight, and I enfranchiz'd from all feare of shame. This new soile made my pleasure to abound, And freed my soule from each thought-piercing wound. Thus my first Rape, first cause of my first care, was couered, ended, and cleane extirpate: But Fortune neuer absolutelie faire, enuy'd the pleasure of my pleasde estate. And sent a crosse to countercheck my gladnesse, Which chaunce a fresh prouok'd new cause of sadnes. But loe, the penult period of my time, hastes my returne to my redeemlesse prison: Castor doth not appeare within this clime, and his, and my twin-brother high is risen. Whose rising and whose falling do declare That my pain'd ghost must backe to paine repaire. Then heer I must abruptlie leaue to showe. my second cause of second detriment: And as my marriage ceast my former woe, so there Ile cease my ghostlie drirement. Returning where my Ghost eternallie, Is plagued with paines perpetuitie. VVith this she vannisht cleane from out my view, which all this while attended her lamenting: And for that I by her reporting knew, the means and manner of her soules tormenting, I vndertooke reportatiuely shewing, To manifest her mickle sorrowing. The which although I haue but rudely pend, as wanting that sweet straine of Poesie: Which such may vse, whose wisdomes comprehend, matters exceeding mediocritie. Yet daine with patience reader for to be, Of this my rude vnpollisht poetrie. Wherein if ought offend the readers eie, or seeme offensiue to the hearers eare, I humblie pray them that of curtesie, they will vouchsafe with my first fruts to beare. And not with me or mine offended be, Quod mei musÃ¦ suut primitiÃ¦. First fruites they are, of my frost bitten Muse, weakened by youth and wrong'd by indiscretion: Yet if that you will gently it peruse, and with correction passe each imperfection, Ile take aduantage of each idle time, Till I shall please you with more pleasing rime.
