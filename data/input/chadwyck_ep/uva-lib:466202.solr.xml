      <field name="fulltext">THE RIVER-SIDE, A POEM, IN THREE BOOKS. ??????? ??? ????. ????. TO THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE CORK LIBRARY SOCIETY, THE FOLLOWING POEM IS DEDICATED BY THEIR VERY HUMBLE SERVANT, The AUTHOR. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. Proœmium—Subject proposed—Invocation to Anthea—Source of the River—the Fowler and his Dog—the Heron—migratory Fowls—a Rocky Stream—a Chalybeat Spring—a Mill-stream—the course of the River less barren,—Remains, of ancient Forests, the effects of their removal on Society—A Mountain Walk—the River encreased, its noise at a distance rushing with rapidity down a glen—a Dark Path by the River-side—a Rural Bridge—the City Nymph—Country Girls bearing victuals to Men at work in the fields—Peasant Boy fishing—a Wild Rocky Scene, favourable to the contemplative mind, and poetical fancy—View of the Country from a Rock—the River in its progress interrupted by Rocks, forms a Cascade—the Angler—Cruelty of casting Lime into the River—Flax also poisonous to Fish—the Ford dangerous in Floods—Randal and Anna—the Mill—the Pattern, or rural Dance—the Blind Piper—State of the Peasantry considered—the River assumes a more noble aspect, flows slowly on with encreased magnitude, surrounded with Groves—Water Plants —Reeds resembling the spears of an army in ancient array—the Plains of Philippi and Pharsalia—Character of the Irish—Swans—the Moor-Hen—City Fowlers— the River takes the appearance of a Lake, surrounded by inaccessible Rocks, high Mountains, and extensive Woods—the Country Lad and his Pipe—the Cotter's Hut—Apostrophe to Nature—the Wild Brook—Reflections—Wood Cutters—Cataract, and Reflections occasioned thereby. While the loud din of arms tumultuous rings From clime to clime—and the red shafts of war Unceasing fly—is there a peaceful theme Can now delight? While every ear enclines To hear of combats and the sack of towns, Of armies routed, and embattled fields Deform'd with dead; who with adventurous hand Shall touch the string? Yet some there still are found Who from such evils, love at times to fly And seeking sylvan quiet and the seat By mossy spring, delight to court the muse, Woo'd happ'ly in the silent Summer shade. Of such am I; and while the busy world Anxiously follow some unreal bliss With ceaseless toil—the River's-side I choose, And all its mazes, from the secret spring Along the grassy bank and shrubby bourne By cliff and cragg to where the freighted barque Rides fearless of the frown on Neptune's brow, Or surly Eurus' rage and tune retired A pipe of homely stop. And do thou come Anthea, for thou lov'st the rural walk, Inspire the muse who sings for thee alone, And I'll invoke no other power, nor need The inspiring air of Phocian Castaly, Pierian fountains, or the sacred Hill By Phœbus lov'd, and the Aonian maids. From some cold rock in woody covert hid, Clear springing forth with pure unsullied drops, Or bubbling out, with soft and tuneless fall, From the drear bosom of some barren wild, Remote, and hopeless of the mower's toil, Or waving Ceres; where the bending waste From the bleak summits of two neighbouring hills Forms a rude plain; the River comes, at first Distinguish'd only by the tufted rush, Or wat'ry cresses, that its course denote Seen verdant mid the rigid desart brown: And seldom seen but by the Fowler. He, With vent'rous foot, the yielding surface treads From tuft to tuft—he knows the place alone And shuns the faithless green, that hides below A treacherous abyss; while, as he toils, With measured step and slow, his faithful dog Sedulous amid the marshy covert tries, And plunges often in—up springs the snipe, And whirrs on rapid pennon 'gainst the breeze, Sole habitant of these neglected swamps, Except the Heron, who perhaps at times Attracted here for prey, far down the glen, Beside a clump of flags, silent and still, Scarcely distinguished by his slender form, Stands lonely; startled at the deadly sound, With outstretch'd neck, he rises o'er the fen With heavy beating wing, unwieldy, slow, A doubtful burthen on the mountain air, And then, his lengthened neck into a curve Contracting, wheels into the middle sky, And far away he floats, screaming aloft, Complaining of the bold intruder, man. Here too, in winter time, from their high course, (Paying the annual visit Nature prompts) Descend the Plover and the vagrant tribes, That yearly migrate hither from the wilds Of distant Cronium, or the northern coast Of rough Suevicum, in milder climes To seek the food their native fields deny. As yet a slender urn the River pours; A little nameless rill, that trickles down, Obscure amid its rudely channel'd bed; Divided oft in many a slender vein By the heaped ruin of the mountain flood, Through which it drips; 'till with collected stream, It spouts from ridge to ridge, then sinks again And chafes and murmurs, 'till a smoother bed Spreads it abroad a silver current clear, Dimpling along round many a pointed stone, And shews a lengthened train of broken light; Then sudden falls into a yawning rift, And thence escaping, glances rapid down Compact and smooth; and now on either side Receives the offered tributes of the hills, That trickling fall from many a pendent rock Mid tangling briers that begin to cloathe Its mossy sides, and oft discoloured seen By mineral dross from the adjacent ore, That in the secret chambers of the hill, Lies far and deep.—Here where the frequent drop, Has scooped a hollow in the neighbouring rock, Of old repute the healing spring is found, Abstergent, whose unfailing pow'r subdues The slow consuming malady, and lifts, When other med'cines fail, the wasting wretch From death.—Hither perhaps in crowds Throng the pale city nymphs and pining youth, And from th'salubrious fountain daily quaff The rosy draught of health.—Nor seldom here, Love shoots his darts unerring, while the walk, For exercise advised, is oft prolonged In tender converse o'er these shrubby hills Till soft affection rises o'er the soul, Melts on the lip, and trembles on the tongue, Known by th'expressive eloquence of eyes The tender sigh returned and yielding hand, The mutual spark expands into a flame, That pity kindled first and gentle care. Nor is the infant stream, less friendly here To active industry, on many a mill He pours his waters, or diverted far To where the shelving hill invites a fall, A borrow'd portion from his channel flows; And fields before unbless'd by nature's hand, With the refreshing rill or grateful spring, Welcome the stranger to their arid breasts, And in the lustre of his little stream Rejoicing, strew his slender banks with flowers. The opening glen soon shews, on either hand, A scene less barren, 'mid the rocks arise, Of various hues, and sown by Nature's hand, The mountain shrub, and oaks of lessened growth; Perhaps ascending from the ancient roots Of mighty forests, that in times remote, Embraced in solemn umbrage half our isle, Beneath whose dark protection dwelt secure, The savage Wolf, or lawless bandit fierce; 'Till industry, and salutary laws, Unsheltered both; and made the peasant's cot, Secure from nightly prowl of man or beast, And what his hard hand earned in the field, Gave him to eat in sweet security. How grateful is the air that breathes around, From many a scented thorn.—Here let us range This dubious walk, that winds its erring way Amid these hazels; whose projecting boughs, Shall shield my fair from Phœbus' downward ray. Or let us range the mountain's airy side, While the fresh breeze, from purer regions blown, Fans the wild flower, that not with less perfume Than garden-nurtured plants delicious yield, With mingled odours, scents the idle heath. And strawberries of keener flavour pluck, And brighter glow; whose root no gard'ner trim'd Protection none bestow'd from the rude blast, When winter blew his cold ungenial breath; O'er hill and dale.—Or if far prospect please, We'll climb the upmost point, and look around, O'er the diminish'd landscape far and wide; And sit delighted on some woody steep, That high o'erlooks the sylvan scene below. Swell'd to a stream, the river rolls along, With distant murmurs; intermitting oft, As dies the breeze; and through the opening glade Seen restless darting down the hollow dell; By many a jutting stone retorted, vext, And wheel'd in circling eddies rapid on, Now through a sunny visto purls away, And now, beneath the deep, projected, shade, Of broken cliffs, with oaks umbrageous crown'd, Obscurely winds. Let's quit the hilly seat, (The vale invites us to its verdant shades) And the cool mazes of the river trace, Down through its winding course; this crooked path Descending dark, beneath the leafy cope, Of trees co-mingling high, their adverse boughs, Leads to the rural bridge—a storm struck elm, That lays its ivied trunk from bank to bank, Recumbent o'er the stream, a giddy pass; Where with recoiling step, and shrinking form, Timid retiring from the rugged brink, The city nymph would fear to venture soft, Her velvet foot;—though here with nimble pace, Oft trip her sun-burnt sisters of the vale, Whether with baskets stowed, or early pails With balmy steam, they seek the distant town; Or to the neighbouring fields, the frugal meal, Bear welcome, to the swains that toiling sweat, In the red furrow, or the fuming swarth Of new-mown hay, or stubble widely spread, With the heaped treasures of the ripened year. Rude as the rock, and as the prospect wild, Congenial to the scene, the peasant boy, Ragged and staring through his bushy locks, Sits on a mossy crag; with artless line, From a long osier cast into the deep. Others more vent'rous climb from steep to steep, Where bilberries in ripe profusion spread; By custom bold— Dark and more solemn now Grows the wild scene; depending rocks and trees, And mossy grots, and dripping caverns dank, Fit habitation as it well may seem, For rural deities as poets feign; Dryad or Hemadryad, or rude Faun, Satyrs, or Naids crown'd with waving sedge; That dwell in woods, and haunt the secret flood: Divine retreat for him who loves the muse, And from the deep confusion of the town, Loves to retire; and on some mossy bank, Enjoys the tranquil day, fill'd with the love Of Nature, and her works; 'till the full tide Of rapture hurrying through the kindling soul, Lifts him to Heaven—or with a chosen book, In pleasing study charms the passing hour; That like the stream, with never wearying pace, Slips ceaseless down into that silent vale, Where ends the progress of all human things. Here deep forgetful of the busy world, And all the toiling sons of care and strife, Let me repose, in woody night retired. I love the hollow grot, and mossy dell With wild flowers sweet, and matted foliage fresh; Where hums th'industrious bee; or pitching rill With distant roar, through rocky mazes deep, Soft on the ear with lulling murmur falls. Lead me ye genii to th'enchanted rock, Where in speluncal darkness fairies dwell, And trickling waters chime; where never bathe The sultry hours, nor red Aurora laves Her radiant brow; thence let me look abroad O'er dell and dingle, wood and level lawn, And furrow'd field, and wildly tangled copse, And broad high-way, with slowly labouring team; The distant city, cot, or ruin'd tower, Or far remote the sea a level line, Speck'd by the lessen'd barque—the headland bluff Stretching a dusky length, or shining bay Or narrow frith, or harbour thickly thronged With the black ships of war; from whose long sides The far exploded guns are scarcely heard; Or inland mountain dim, with summit blue A doubtful object, mingling with the clouds. O'er all the wide extended prospect round Let my eye wander in delighted gaze, From the small rill that murmurs at my foot, To where the soft horizon meets the sky: And see the river wandering far away, Through sun, and shade, with peopled bank or bare, Verdant or brown, with hurried course or slow, Abrupt or smooth, in all its various forms; And there unenvious of the glare of courts, All the bright noon I'd tune my rural pipe; And sing the river as it flows along. Grown into force by many a gurgling brook, That from the hanging woods precipitates Into its channel, the determined stream A bolder tone assumes, and white with foam, As intervening rocks obstruct its course, With oft refracted current hoarse and deep, Involved, distracted, in a raging gulf, It boils and swells, 'till with irruption quick, And force resistless hurrying furious on, Down through a rugged gap it wildly pours, With deaf'ning uproar to the vale below, The vale below, the grots and hollow caves, Within their deep recesses seem to groan; And down the dale the agitated stream, Still frets fermenting o'er its gravell'd bed. Now see beyond yon ivied arch where wide, Over its sandy floor the river spreads, Into a shoal, and ripples in its course. There the mute angler o'er the pebly brim, Close where the shallowing river forms a strand, Stands patient, hopeful of the scaly prize, Eying the gilded fraud with skilful glance: While from his hand bends the long pliant rod, Artfully tremulous; rewarding well His toil, if Phœbus hide his burning head In friendly clouds; but if with ardent beam He furious shine, and brighten every rill, Vain task indeed, to whip the spangling stream. With fruitless line toss'd idly—but at eve Let the keen angler stand beside the deep, And throw the shining beetle silent in, Or the grey hooded moth with mealy wings, Not thrown in vain, which with a bulky prey Sends him home joyous, if no sad mischance Attend his labours; for the line o'erstrained By the unusual burthen, often snaps, And leaves the vacant rod; or worse mishap The rod itself gives way, and half remains A useless staff—awhile the angler stands In silent wishful gaze upon the spot, Where sunk his hopes; then homeward sadly turns With slow, reluctant step, and to the friend That meets him on the way, relates his loss With great exaggeration.? But of all Who search the fruitful river, cruel they Who in the peopled current murderous throw The slacking lime; destructive to the race That breathe the running brook, or standing lake. Seized in his gravelly bed, beneath the shade Of waving sedge, the trout with yellow gill, Swell'd by the poisonous suffocating draught, In many a circle wildly hurrying dies, And turns his gold side glistening to the sun. Ev'n in his friendly mud the writhed eel The subtile venom feels, and lies at length Bloated and stiff beneath his native pool. The river whitens thro' its distant streams, And all the finny multitude expires. And O forbear! ye rural swains to lay The banded flax, beneath the wholesome wave; As deleterious to the scaly tribe, And mortal where so e'er its influence spreads: But wisely in the quaggy hole, or fen, Much more appropriate, steep the valued swarth; So shall the river to your board bestow, In season due a plentiful supply. Not distant hence amid the broad brown flags Disposed in measured pace across the stream (Trod' by the villagers with unwet hose) Brawls the wide ford, a safe and certain pass When summer suns have drank the mountain rills But when black wintry clouds involve the peaks Of yon high hills and their bleak sides invest With rolling volumes, dangerous is the way And dreadful roars the tawny torrent down And frequent from the haggart or the field Bears off the sheafy treasures of the year And mows of hoarded hay, and trees uptorn Though rooted deep and wide, an age's growth; With implements of husbandry; and leaves The stubbled plain and copse and verdant close A sandy waste for many an acre round. The bank feels most its fury, and resigns Its grassy margins to the impetuous flood; Cut from below it crumbles headlong in Narrowing the velvet glebe, freckled with flow'rs And willows green, that love to kiss the stream, Narcissus like with ever bending head. Yet not unfrequent in the summer time, Swell'd by the upland show'r, the river mounts With sudden rage, and on the bank perplex'd The disappointed traveller leaves to mourn Or measure back a long and tedious way. But ah! the hapless tale, I heard it oft From the sad shepherds who remember well The tragic scene, and still relate with tears, Of Randal and his lovely Anna's fate. Where yonder solitary mansion lifts Its cheerless walls, beside yon woody knoll, There dwelt a man of wealth and generous fame, His name was Alford. From his bounteous board And ready hand the wretched never turned Uncherished, honoured by the country round, Rich in the favour of the great and good And blessings of the poor, he led a life Of primal innocence and rural ease, 'Till time had crown'd his reverend brows with snow. One only son he had, his dearest hope, The youthful image of his father's worth, A form in manly grace excelled by none, A mind enriched with every gentle art And polished manners—Randal was his name. From earliest youth he loved a gentle maid, The humble offspring of a rural pair, Who in the neighbouring fields laborious earn'd, In frugal living for their darling child, A competence in flocks and country geer. To wed her, suited to their simple views, To some industrious swain, and die content, Their only hope and dearest wish on earth. She, lovely maid, was by an aged dame, Who hereby dwell'd, train'd up in virtue's school, Where Randal often came, two lovelier sure Ne'er met—in childish play their hours they spent, Attachment ripen'd with their opening charms, 'Till infant friendship kindled into love. She now was in the blush and prime of youth, And bless'd her parents' cot, the sweetest flower That in this valley grew, the village pride; The subject she of every ditty rude Tuned artless by the uncouth country swains, And object of each brutal squire's address; But she for Randal felt an equal flame That with loves' brightest, truest lustre burn'd. Their plighted faith was given, and the vow, The sacred vow beyond all earthly ties Of endless love and firm unshaken truth, And each with mutual ardor wish'd the morn Was but arrived, that would their union seal, And sanctify their bliss.—But hope deceives— Old Alford saw the fond attachment grow, And, in his mind, the pride of ancestry Arising pain'd his thoughts, lest he might see His ancient line dishonour'd. To his son One morn he gave the fatal interdiction, And Randal must no more his Anna see— A father's mandate—In his generous soul Conflicting love and duty furious strove, Unequal strife—he mourn'd in solitude, And to yon wood he pour'd his sorrows forth, For one whole day heard by the passing hind; Thrown mournful on the mossy margent green Of lonely rill, or 'neath embow'ring folds Of over hanging boughs, deep sunk in woe, And listless of the birds that warbled near. At length to this resolve he came, once more To see his love and in her gentle ear Himself to pour the melancholy news And with what argument he might devise, Prepare her to endure the heavy tale; While hope still whispered, Alford yet may look More kindly on their love. Borne by the thought Beyond the present ill, his bounding heart Leap'd forward to the rosy prospect sweet Of future days, with clear and cloudless skies, Uninterrupted love and endless joy. Soon as the morn, beneath the crimson folds Of the proud curtain'd east, look'd forth and all The verdant hills and every blossom'd spray With trembling lustre bright of orient gems Seem'd full of life and joy, and thro' the woods From many a sylvan pipe the natural hymn Of gratitude arose to him, whose hand Gives change of day and night and wet and dry, And when the ravage of the wintry winds Has strip'd the bow'rs, and laid the forests bare, Who with unceasing fond, parental care, Returning still recloathes the naked year. With the first beam, after a restless night, Randal arose, as was his custom oft, To rural sports, and to his love he hastes— All day they wander'd o'er the usual walks In converse fond thro' the dark covering grove, Or winding thicket green, or bushy copse, The witnesses of many a tender scene, Nor thought of parting 'till the purple clouds Of evening streaked the west, when Randal sad, While from his swelling heart the frequent sigh Resistless burst, the heavy tidings told. How both then felt who shall in verse describe, Vain task—lock'd silent in each others arms; Long time they stood—and seemed as they had vowed They never more would part—but part they must; Pale eve arose, and with her came thick clouds, Portending storm and rain, that now to fall In thickening mist began, sealed with a kiss The mutual pledge they gave of endless love, And parted—she to her humble home in tears, He to'rd his father's house went sad and slow. Ah! little thought she with that parting kiss She gave the last adieu—the morrow came And on the bank, known by the village boys, The faithful dog that followed Randal's heel, Sat howling—soon amid the hamlet ran The horrible surmise, confirmed quick By the youth's absence; all along the banks The mournful rusticks try with ceaseless toil, And mingling words of woe ingenuous pour'd, From out the sedgy pool at length redeem, His stiffen'd corse—The lovely maid survived The dreadful shock, but reason fled with hope. Long o'er these banks with frantic gestures wild, Or moping mid the rushy moors alone, A poor crazed wretch she pined, till death's kind call Released her from her woes.—How often thus The sweetest wreaths that love and nature twine, By some rude shock are rent, some mortal stroke. How often too, when in the rosy hours Of youth and innocence the tender shaft Has pierced two gentle corresponding hearts, Though ev'ry hope is smiling sweet, and joy Shaking his purple wings their steps attend, Parents averse their childrens' ruin seal. Now turn and let the tender tear subside, That pity wou'd bestow on hapless love And look beyond to that rude scene of mirth, Under the covert of a woody cragg, From whose rough side the ready current springs Upon the wheel below, that all day long Turn'd ceaseless, now the day's whole task is done, The silent mill no more obeys the stream, And see from every side the villagers Come glad to taste the evening pastime blithe And dance upon the green; for ancient Hodge Can scrape a jarring string to which the heel Of many a nymyh has bounded in the days Long past, or bidden from his distant home Full many a dusty mile the minstrel comes. He, hoary-headed man from early youth Deprived the blessed light, assumed the pipe Unfit for toil, his only refuge now, And refuge not despised, amid the swains From pinching want in his declining years. With head erect and placid brow serene Led by some friendly hand he takes his seat Amid the jocund ring, most honour'd guest, And in his hand by some distinguished fair The mantling cup is placed—and soon refreshed Forth with a careful hand he slowly draws The shining tubes, whose wild sonorous voice, When heard, suspends their loud loquacious glee, Or interrupts the bashful lover's tale Then first with awkward air and fault'ring speech, Whisper'd into the blushing damsel's ear Who with affected coy indifference Or plaits her kerchief or adjusts her hair, A vain disguise.—And now with ready spring, Soon as the droney lilt is heard, all rise, With sudden joy inspired, and jig along Sounding the level glebe, with many a jirk And uncouth gesture, while adown their cheeks Flushed with the glow of health, the trickling dew Runs frequent, while the laugh sincere and roar Of unfeigned merriment re-echoes round. Or wearied with the long laborious joy The tuneful sage invokes a graver muse And gives the ancient strain that roused the chiefs Of other days—the battle rages now And horrid tumult with the mingled groans Of dying foes, kerns and gallowglasses Mixed in the fiery front of cruel war Septs pouring on the field in all the rage Of family dissention kindled fell Through wide extended consanguinity. Or warm'd with the gen'rous draught resigns anon The martial strain, and with an alter'd hand Of love pours out the soft and melting lay As best he can.—Love is his master strain, Confess'd by mute attention leaning round In fond enjoyment rapt. Not more regard A British audience pays, nor more applause, When in their theatres assembled full, Or in Westminster's awful dome to hear Sublimest Handel's seraph song divine, Haydn's true air, or Pleyel's melodies Oft on the willing ear returning sweet, Through the quick maze of modulated sound, Withheld to fall more grateful on the sense, If Yanowitz impetuous sweep the string, Or Ashe run out the long and learn'd strain. Such are the pleasures rural swains enjoy When labour yields to rest its portion due Sweet is the hour of rest, the joys how sweet Of rural dance, and all the village sports By toil enhanced. Happy their humble lot How happy, did they know the bliss to live Unburthen'd with the cares the great attend, Ah! would they ne'er disturb their tranquil lives With speculations wild, by restless men, Into their simple and ingenuous minds Instilled; their state were enviable sure: All are not born to rule; that arduous task Few can assume, and while the peasant feels His life and property, his dearest rights Guarded 'gainst plunder or oppressive force, Ev'n with the proud and rich—why ask he then Who wields the sceptre and who wears the crown? The river now a more majestic form Assumes, the valley widens, and the hills (Cloathed with verdant groves, whose bowering skirts Oft to the banks extend, and o'er the wave Stretch their umbrageous boughs) with many a cot And whitened villa animated smile. Swept into bays the river winds along, Full to its margin, fringed with blossom'd herbs Of luscious fume, and many a wat'ry flower Sweet smelling mint and all the various bloom, That crowns the bank and scents the summer breeze, And stately reed in clusters rising thick Like firm compacted cohorts in the fields Of ancient battle ranged; Actium or Cannæ, Or Philippi, which after ages saw White with the bones of heroes; or that plain Pharsalia, dreadful scene of civil strife, Roman 'gainst Roman fired, O! may such sight Be absent long, nor sound of trump or steel Disturb my native soil, in fruitful hills And verdant vales unrivall'd, and a race With hands more prompt to lift the ready latch To wandering wretch, or hungry traveller, Than point the deadly gun or gleaming spear, Yet when in arms to check a foreign foe, Or guard their native coast from the approach Of hostile navies, in the fight excell'd By none of arctic or of southern clime. Now scarce a breeze with light ætherial wing Ruffles the limpid space, undimpled, smooth Except by yonder jutting bank o'er hung With waving verdure, where the Paphian bird, Close to his snowy mate, with neck recurved, Sails proudly, while around them play secure The dusky cygnets, or 'mid her downy wings Borne by the watchful parent bird, repose. Or from the rushy covert sudden flushed The moor-hen flutters wild, by city youth Pursued inglorious, while within the shade Her infant brood's concealed; forbear such sport. And learn ye giddy swains more manly play, And in such season, cease with cruel hand To persecute the harmless feather'd race. Now after many a sweep amid the vales Through dark brown forests, fields, and grassy downs By castled eminence, and shepherd's cot, Wide and more wide the opening river spreads Into a lake, border'd with hanging woods And rocks sublime, crag above crag emboss'd With native shrubs, the free spontaneous growth Of this rude garden, intermingling hues As various as their kinds, with fruit and flow'r Diversely hung, a wildly varied scene, With pipe of many a bird, and dash of rills Heard far within, with lulling murmur soft Gurgling through mossy grots, or trickling chill Down the green brow of some projecting cliff, Brought on the breeze—while far behind uplift Rough mountains vast their cheerless summits gray Above the vegetable world upraised, Naked, and wan, into the keener air, While round their vast foundations dark, and dread, The forest deepens into solemn shade, Beneath the concave still of spreading oaks Thick'ning on ev'ry side for ages, wide Wood beyond Wood descried, a brown expance, Mid whose sequester'd dells, the rural swain The wild path wanders oft, at fervid noon, And winds its dark intricacies, amused To pluck the hanging filbert from the spray, Or lies along beneath the ancient elm, Whose ivied trunk leans o'er the brook below, With cool clear stream that 'neath the hanging cope Of verdant osiers trickles through the shade, Wooing soft echo on his sylvan pipe, 'Till evening veils the woods in deeper gloom, And o'er the landscape sheds a sober grey, Through which at distance rises straight and thin The long blue smoak from the lone cotter's hearth, Sunk in the bosom of a silent vale, There he, in hoary age, his scanty fare Digs from a patch, his aged hand has till'd, And drinks the stream—his only company A little homely cat, his trade to range The hollow mazes of the neighbouring woods, From whence the withered stick he daily brings Collected mindful of the winter's fire. O! there were days, when, in such scenes as these, I've roved unmindful of the times to come, And rob'd the sycamore, or willow green, Of many a pipe, nor even thought, that age Followed my steps, and in Elisium lost Went on from dell to dell, from bow'r to bow'r, And felt a rapture, yet knew not from whence The rapture flowed—O! nature 'twas from thee, Thou and thy works my early childhood pleased, Soothed my youth (when many a frowning care Sat by my pillow when I should have slept And bade me wake;) and taught me first to sing. Shall I forget thee nature in my song? No—when in green thou walk'st the dewy lawn, Or crown'd with roses sit'st in summer's shade, When heavy harvests load the yellow fields, Or winter houls the withered groves among. Is there a man who never feels a calm And peaceful joy, o'er his expanding soul, Steal grateful, while, within the umbrage cool Of woodland dingle by the wild brook side, He strays remote—Ah! no, in scenes like these The soul disburthened leaves the world behind, Its cares, its tumults, and its various wiles, And feels, with conscious dignity, awake The finer passions—every grosser thought Subsiding, as superior wishes rise; With honor, friendship, charity, and love, The heart dilating spreads its fibres forth And unrestrained embraces all mankind. What sounds are these deep echoed through the glens With oft repeated stroke?—yon vista tells, So lately canopied with living oaks, It is the axe lays waste the sylvan scene, And sweeps relentless through its green domains: Tree after tree submits—the frequent fall Loud rustling through the kindred branches tells How wide the devastation—Hovering o'er In many a circle, hark! the clam'rous rooks Ask for their wonted seat and scarcely know Their ancient home; now levell'd with the earth On every side the prostrate ruins lie, Never to wave again their leafy heads, Or yield a covert to the feathered choir, Who now, with broken song remote and shy, Seek other bowers, their native branches gone. Heard in the murmur of yon mountain stream, Methinks, the sylvan beings seem to chide And mourn their wonted shades—their wonted shades The Naiads weep, while round their oozey locks The wild flowers wither and their azure breasts They shew reluctant to th'obtrusive day, And many a silver-footed rill obscure, That ran a cool course tinkling down the dells, Vocal no more, resigns her chrystal urn, And leaves her channel dry, forbear, forbear And spare my bowers, the woodland genius cries But cries in vain, the greedy thirst of ore, To furnish follies in a foreign land, Strips with rapacious hand these oak-crown'd hills, Disrobes the vales and denudates the Plain. From the rough forehead of yon frowning steep Whitens the Cataract, scarce heard from hence, But nearer seen, tremendous gushing down From ragged precipice disgorged amain, Shaking the solid hill There let the mind Expand in contemplation, and contemn Man's little efforts. Mid these awful scenes— In these dread walks impassable to men, In solitude sublime, remote, retired The God of Nature moves, confess'd to those Who seek him in his works, and bowing feel His guiding hand perform the varied whole. O! let me ne'er forget, as oft I stray By hill or forest, flowery field or vale, By headlong torrent wild, or lucid rill That licks the rosy verge of some rich lawn, Or hurries babbling down a shrubby dell, Or by the woodland stream or mountain rill Along their vagrant courses musing fond Whose works they are, nor fail in homage due To him who made, designed, and orders all.

Who can behold that book which Nature spreads Open to all, and not desire to read? Who through the fields the forests and the hills, Or varying river-side with pleasures full Can stray unheedful of the lessons wise She writes on every bush, on every bell That opes its dewy eyelids to the morn, And every lowly offspring of the plains The reptile moss, or blade of humble grass That cloathes the earth with verdant mantle bright? O! thou whose finger traced the wond'rous whole Who bade it live, and saw that all was good, In these, thy tender providence is seen, As in thy mightiest and most perfect work. Where e'er I turn thou art, moving or still, Vocal or silent, nature displays thy power, And shews thy hand in all her various forms: Whether ascending in the cheerful east She paints the morn with vivid colours clear, Displays at noon her full expanded glow Of blushing sweets, and every varied life O'er Evening spreads her dewy mantle grey, Or bids the night with stellar radiance shine. Past this rough hill, the landscape softens down, And, through a long retiring visto far, Placid and smooth the copious river winds, And shews remote his silver current clear, In many a curve along the fruitful vale, 'Till lost amid the blended tints obscure, Of airy distance thin, he disappears. On his green sides delicious prospects rise, O'er which, the wandering sense delighted strays, After yon wild tumultuous scene, and now On either hand unfolds the milder view Perhaps of lordly habitation rich With grove and garden gay, and fruited wall, And many a sculptured marble mocking life From Greek or Roman models copied fair Laacoon distressing sight, Discobollus, Or dying Gladiator, Mars, or Jove With lifted bolt: Phœbus or Dian fair, Or that transcendant form, art's proudest boast, So soften'd sweet to beauty's tenderest mould The luscious swell of youth, and melting look Of Feminine perfection, justly call'd The queen of beauty, beauty's standard fair; With many a hero sage and demigod Reviving in the mind the precious lore Of classic page—the old Athenian flame And all the glory of the Roman state. Or farther on, the farmer's humble thatch— Fallow and stubble, with the busy toil Of labouring plow, held by the patient hand Of hoary peasant; and the various cares And homely business of a country life; With slopes of verdant pasture, clustered thick With tinkling flocks, and herds of lowing kine, A pastoral scene; or paddock square, enclosed With sheltering hedges 'gainst the summer sun Or wintry blast; and widely wall'd domain Shut from the husbandman, a proud display With deer emparked. Close on the velvet marge, On a rich glebe, reflected from the deep, Embraced with shadow'y elms and sycamore With ivy bound, a venerable pile Lifts its sharp pointed ruins, once the seat Of Monkish ease, and dark religious pomp. There many an antique monument is found, Illegible and faithless to its charge, That deep insculped once held in measured phrase The mighty acts of those who sleep below, And many an uncouth shapeless figure grim, Rude effigies of heroes dead of yore, Or sage and letter'd saints whose pious hands Those ponderous masses raised—forgotten now They and their monuments alike repose— How vain is man—how feeble in his works, How ineffectual all his proud attempts To stop progressive ruin, or uphold What hourly still decays, as with the tooth Of canker eaten—fleeting as a shade— Wasting ere well begun. Ah! what avails The arch sublime, or graceful colonade, The marble porch, or heav'n-aspiring dome, That art its powers exhausted to adorn— Ah! who untouch'd for man's uncertain state Can contemplate the remnant of thy pride, Fall'n Tadmor, once how great, thy pillard length Lies like a skeleton, the naked frame Of what once lived, now bleaching in the waste And sandy desart, and by those who dwell Amid thy fragments, all thy fame unknown. Where now is Babylon, the mighty city, The Pyramids who raised them, or can tell Whether by Chemmis or Cephrenes heap'd, Or Cheops who his Daughter's honor sold? They once were kings. The merest bending slave That bow'd beneath his weight, whose mandate call'd A nation to the toil, now occupies As large a portion of his mother earth And sleeps as undisturbed.—Persepolis, Where art thou?—tell ye patient men Who penetrate (with honest hope to add To human knowledge) these deserted climes. How small a portion now remains of thee To tell how great thou wast—the silent tomb, Of many a buried name—sages and chiefs, Men great and good, the patrons kind of art, Friends to the muses, lovers of mankind, With souls that felt for ev'ry creatures' woe, Howards of ancient times, the raptur'd bard High favour'd by the muse, and meek to bear The frowns of fortune and unworthy men, The sneer of envy and the scoff of fools And all, that bare-faced ignorance presumes, In pleasing contemplation of the wreath Posterity might hang upon his tomb. Though the bright flame of sacred poesy Illumines modern days, and what the bards Of oldest times have built in mighty verse Endures the wreck of states, a monument That time spares longest of the works of men; And part outlived the fierce devouring rage Of that fell crew which in the barbarous times Of Gothick night, o'erthrew the learned world, And made a desart of that Garden fair, Where dwelt the muses, and profan'd their bow'rs With impious bloodshed and the clank of steel; Yet those the few who touch the sacred lyre Gifted by Heav'n to feel above mankind, With that angelick energy of soul And wide extended mind, embracing quick, As with a view, all nature and her works, Ev'n those at last reluctant time consigns To chill oblivion—All the pride of rule, The pomp of triumph and the laurel wreath, Pluck'd in the sanguin'd field, ev'n in the roar Of half a world's applause, at last must fail Though every hero had a muse to sing, And to his valour raise the epic strain. Where are your trophies all, ye mighty men, Banners and 'scutcheons, cenotaphs, and arms Wrested from foes in battle? Do they lie Oft in a corner of some ruin'd pile, A prey to damps and coated o'er with moss, That hide your titles, fragile to the touch Of curious finger, that perhaps may try Once in an age, those antique characters, And rudely chissel'd cyphers to explore; Perhaps in vain! yes poor Ephemera This is the end of all your hoped applause To lie forgotten—but be not appal'd The world can give no more, its gifts are sands That fly as veers the blast—be bold as Mars Strong as Alcides, and as Pallas wise, Graceful as Pæan, or as Hebe fair, With all allurements mind or body give, The memory of your fame has its decline And dies at last.—dare to be virtuous then, And look above this perishable mass, This ever changing round that hourly feeds Upon itself, discharging from its womb Its future food—despise what earth can give And fix upon that crown a steady eye, That patient suffering and unshaken faith Receive above the clouds, nor heed when death Shall number thine amid the names that sleep To be forgotten by the busy world, Or in a Season, or a thousand years. This solemn gloom and aweful stillness prompt To serious thought, and these poor dumb remains Bleached by the wint'ry blast and vernal show'r, In many a heap, or cast promiscuous round, Teach serious lessons of mortality: For who so lost in levity but feels To see the shell, where glow'd the luscious lip And speaking eye—where dwelt the dulcid tongue, The brow that might deserve the muse's wreath, From whence the soft redundant tresses fell Around the iv'ry neck, perhaps beneath The awkward pressure of the peasant's heel. Who can suppress the sigh for those that were, While from the mossy stone he looks around Upon the relicks of those distant days. Here lie the bones that once the revel string Stir'd into graceful action, or the trump Sent tow'ring to the field in rattling steel, The mighty arm no more determined fierce Aims the decisive blow—they now are hush'd And sleep unconscious in their narrow beds. 'Tis evening still, and oe'r the liquid plain Scarce stirs a breeze—a general repose Throughout all nature reigns and not a leaf Rustles above. Gilt by the setting sun These reverend tow'rs and antique columns grey A short lived glory share. Behold within, While through yon ivied window's solemn arch With sculpture rich and ancient tracery He shoots his latest beam, and sudden lights The hollow nave,—how dreary is the scene, How silent, save the cry of that dull bird, Who loves in sad sepulchral gloom to dwell, Now perch'd on yonder marble chief reclined, Frowning in arms and coat of pond'rous mail, That marks the spot where some old Baron lies, The terror once of many a district round. These tottering walls with hoary moss o'ergrown Are now unvocal and their echoes sleep, (Where once the solemn service closed the day And many a voice sonorous fill'd the choir) Save when some crumbling arch by time o'erthrown Down rushes thundering and awakes them all. Methinks I see the pious brotherhood Pass slowly by, in all the pageant form Of ancient worship—hark, now how they swell The ves'pral hymn—from many a pillar'd aisle And long withdrawing vault repeated soft, So unlike human that it almost seems The voices of departed souls, as down From the dim height of these tall sculptured groins It falls co-mingling with the ev'ning breeze That sighs abroad. And now th'expected bell Toll'd from the lofty tow'r proclaims the time For meet refreshment, soon they joyous fill The long refectory, while at the board Some learned stranger shares the plenteous feast, Whose travell'd eye, through many a foreign clime, Had seen whatever ancient art could boast Or modern; and had made from long research His mind a volume fill'd with varied store Of useful knowledge gleaned from books and men. And as they quaff, of classick lore they talk Of wisest Horace, Maro's strain divine Laborious Juvenal, or Persius dark, Or Ovid's amorous verse, while youthful days And joys remember'd kindle every soul, And social mirth illumes the festive board. Now all is past, and desolation drear Usurps the scene, and o'er the sacred fane Sits dumb oblivion with her raven wings Wrapping in envious shades the records dim Of other days. But still the grateful muse Remembers fond, that those were men, whose care Foster'd in days when ignorance prevailed The sacred lessons of the bards of yore, And gave the precious models to our view Of ancient song. Now let us look abroad Under Eve's shadowy veil how doubly sweet The varied scene, melting to softer hues The hills and dales their colours blend serene In one grey mass. Sweet is the red-breast's song From yonder thorn—sad through the elm-grove shade The wood-quest moans,—the rail with tuneless voice Creaks in the meadows and deludes the youth That follows idly through the dewy grass. Sweet is the walk that winds along the stream, Now white with hoary mists, and dimpl'd oft By many a trout, and shews within its wave Bright Hesper's star. But see the thick'ning gloom Falls fast on all around, and wood and lawn, The smoking cot and distant village spire, And tower and lowly hut are lost in shade, 'Till the pale-visaged moon ascending broad Shoots through yon arches deep her sallow beam, And gives the ivied wall and nodding porch A broader shadow. Then as the gossips tell The shrouded ghost forsakes its earthy bed, And, in the moonlight, glide such lurid forms As haunt the pillow of the brain-sick wretch, Whose tortur'd mind conceals some horrid deed Such as Anselmo's, who, as legends tell, Once in these cloisters lived an austere life Recluse, and on his pale emaciate frame Inflicted nightly stripes to expiate A friend deceived and his dishonored bride. In ancient times, when hot religious zeal Drew many a knight to Palestine's domains, To honor God by shedding pagan blood. (More honour'd far who is the prince of peace By deeds of mercy and restraint of war, Philanthropy for all the sons of earth And brotherly affection.) When the flame Romantic caught from breast to breast, through all United Christendom, her prowest knights Assembled to redeem the holy land And shield the pilgrim from the barb'rous hands Of Paynim, and the sacred sepulchre To make accessible to pious feet There journeying bare, and at the madning call Of furious zeal a thousand banners rose. Forward in arms amid the rooded knights Was Arnold, who prepared with hasty sail To join the fleet, and but one tie he had That held him back—love, that conflicting long Gave way to martial glory, and with tears To his dear friend Anselmo he consign'd The fair Emilia fresh in beauty's prime: When I am gone, the youthful warrior said, Visit her frequent, and with words of sense (For such you have) support my weeping love, And bid her not despond, for soon returned, Perhaps with honor crowned, she shall behold Her Arnold; but if not, in heav'n's great cause In Syria's land I lie, and she shall hear That no dishonor mark'd my early fall He sailed away, Anselmo frequent came, And, as he promised, in the damsel's ear Pour'd counsel sage, and from her lovely cheek Wip'd many a tear—but as his eager eye So often dwelt upon her blooming charms, Desire enfuriate in his breast arose, Which unsuspecting confidence, and all The solitary hours so often gain'd In her sweet converse, cherish'd, till at length The time inviting to the treacherous deed, The struggling nymph he seized with brutal force, Assistance far, and he who should defend The weeping fair, himself the ravisher, He ruin'd what he kept and fled for shame. Not long she lived to weep her honour's stain, Nor was he heard of till the news arrived Of Arnold's death, then in yon holy house He took a vow of never ceasing prayer And penance for his guilt, and now 'tis said (But few believe) that still at that sad time Whereon he broke his faith and wrong'd his friend, Thrice round these dreary aisles his tortur'd spright With scorpion whips, lashed by its own fell hand Flies screaming.— Here mid these copses and the breezy brow Of yon high hill, whose chequer'd sides display A cheering scene, for many a mile outspread, Of stubble-land and lawn and fallow brown; Soon as the morn, with chilly fingers dank, Puts back the sallow curtains of the east, And lets the fulgent brow of Phœbus forth, Crown'd orient with the golden wreaths of light And radient beams; roused by the distant call Of hunters mustering on the dewy hills, The stag now flies, and all the mingled roar Of sylvan sport is up, and to the cry The wild wood answers through her hollow glades And deep recesses. Lured from the early plow The rusticks join the shout from many a rock, Eager to catch a glance, and the wild joy Ardent participate, while wide around The village curs bark idly. Far below In the soft bosom of a velvet lawn Beneath a clump of elms, the social set Their rural seat have fixt: The hamper swells, With choicest meat and flasks of mellow wine, The ready fire of russet leaves and boughs At distance kindles, while with busy hands The net is opened long and on the lake, Drawn circular up to the sandy bay, A numerous draught contains; the salmon strikes And the oft-sinking cork declares the prize, The luscious tench and carp and spangled trout And eel convolved in many a slimy wreath Are all an easy prey: While from the sun Through the cool groves with many a song amused The gentle fair the while delighted stray, Along the devious bank by prattling rill, Or winding fond the dark intricate maze Of woodman's path through sylvan alleys brown They pluck the simple bell, transcending oft The garden's proudest boast by Britons sought In wet Batavia. One retiring far, (Perhaps of museful cast, or sick in love) Into the lonely shade, seeks out the seat Close by the weeping rock, from whose green side Drops liquid crystal down, and on the moss Sunk into thought of one at distance then, Perhaps for Britain, on some foreign shore Far fighting; in her soul the image dear She cherishes, nor other converse needs And hears, the solitary minstrel nigh, The red-breast, sweetest of the feather'd tribe, Warble his trickling cadence—sadly pleased With that congenial musick, till the hour Approaching for repast the straggling guests Calls to the appointed shade; where spread at large The feast invites the ready appetite By exercise and the fresh air made sharp; And there they sit beside the lucid lake, While the long day is spent in social mirth And harmony, till the gray slipper'd eve Comes with her humid hand o'er bourne and brake, Sprinkling abroad her dews, and the sunk sun Sets crimson in the west; then to the town, (Full of the pleasures of a rural life,) Returned they mingle in the crowd again. But not to every stream nor ev'ry clime Is given to share those calm secure delights; Nor is each verdant bank, or cooling rill, The scene of social mirth, or rural joy. Nature great parent in dispensing round, To men who use them ill, her precious gifts, Gives not to all alike; nor heaps on one Leaving another bare. With gold or pearl She blesses some, and gives another grain, Iv'ry, or gems; a burning atmosphere To rich Golconda and a race of slaves, To Britain temperate skies and liberty! O lovely goddess! let us see thee still Not with thy flying locks and wild deport, As those would have thee who mistake thy form, But filleted with roses, and thy hand Without a dagger, and unstained with blood. If from these scenes, where first my song was heard Murmur'd obscure along the silver Lee When for Anthea I essayed to blow An humble reed and blush'd and play'd by turns, Ah! conscious of the arduous task I took With youthful hand to touch the dorick pipe— If from these scenes, these scenes for ever dear, The muse should fly beyond th'Atlantic waste To where within the burning tropicks pant The scorching natives, by the torrid streams Of Amasuma or Catua wild, That to the Amazonian torrent pour Their tributary urns—there oft appal'd The traveller starts at every rustling bough, Whose shade conceals some savage beast of prey, Or savage man more dreadful in his rage Than bear, or brinded ounce, tyger, or pard. Or where Indostan spreads her woody vales By Wasset's shady banks, who fearless strays, Or, tempts her twilight groves with dangers full From the wild tenants of her trackless dells Or scaly serpents hid beneath the shade Of many a flowery tuft, or shrubby bower In bloated volumes roll'd with deadly eye Fixt steadfast glaring on the destined prey, Or stretch'd at length beneath the burning noon Prepar'd to strike with dread envenom'd fang. Still is his hapless fall by Britons mourned, The generous youth, who vent'rous wand'ring near, The fatal jungle by the dreadful fangs Of a brute monster died; in vain his friend To save him levell'd the destroying tube, And with true aim the deadly bullet sent, In vain the howling savage dropt his prey Delivered only from the bleeding foe To thank his brave companion and expire. How many a stream whose wild sequester'd banks, Untrodden by the feet of man or beast, Through wood and horrid brake impenetrable, Or faithless quagg extend for many a league, Where in primeval shade, unheard, unseen, Roars the wild torrent, mid the tangling wreck Of woods long sever'd from its hoary sides: How many too deserted, once the seat Of every sweet the shepherd's life bestows And not unvocal to the muse's song, Where are ye fled ye blest Arcadian days, When, in the verdant lap of past'ral bliss, You nursed a harmless race, far from the sound Of war and strife, amid the shelt'ring bow'rs Of spreading palms, to tend their flocks, or blow Unstudied melody from jointed reeds To soothe the hours or please the listening fair. Where are your maids, in nature's softest mould, Cast exquisite in ev'ry polish'd limb, With ev'ry feminine and winning grace Illumin'd cheek and luscious melting lip, And all the sweet intelligence of eye And locks luxuriant waving on the breeze In dark redundant tresses floating soft Tho' unimproved by art, adorned the more By nature's hand, with charms unspeakable, To hold the heart in love's delicious bonds Entangled, fluttering, yet averse to fly From such captivity. Ah! gone indeed, And what a blank remains. A deadly sleep Lies heavy o'er the land, where first the muse Awoke the silent reed to heavenly strains, And ope'd the sacred spring of poesy; Those streams no more to languid numbers creep Of am'rous shepherd hid in shady bower; No more the song of love awakes the fields, Nor on those banks the past'ral muses stray. Short are the joys the wretched native feels, On Dwina's snowy banks, or dreary Irtis, Whose wintry torrent visits sad Tobolsk, A prison not a capital, and thence Through cold Siberian forests sends her stream To arctic Oby, where short summer warms The rigid earth, and then with hasty wing, To frost's bleak reign resigns the cheerless clime. I might recount a thousand northern streams, Whose banks no charms contain of grassy seats Meadow or tufted dell, engem'd with flow'rs Primrose or vi'let, scatter'd by the hand Of May, soft mother of the rosy hours; Where in the summer morn, or silent noon Ne'er bathe the naked graces, nor the muse To shades retiring meditates her song. More cheerless often by the genial breath Of spring that o'er more favour'd lands bestows Forest and field with verdant leaf and flow'r But here spreads desolation far and wide, Are these rude climes—for at her mild return, When the relenting atmosphere unbinds Her liquid stores, and lets the zephyrs forth With loosened pinions, o'er the frozen world, Swell'd by the encreasing thaw wide spreads the flood Of cold Jenisca, drowning all her isles, Or Lena, monarch of the northern streams, Unhinging vast a district wild of snow; And down the wide destroying mountain comes With ice-piled promontories, sweeping off Whole forests to the sea—The peasant starts— The distant murmur gives the dread alarm, Like the first rumbling of th'approaching storm, When the horizon thunders, or the roar Of the returning tide against the beak Of some bold head-land on the southern coast Of sea-beat Erin, when fell Notus rides The bellying brine, heard from the peaceful side Of a rude mountain that looks out to sea; Snatch'd up in haste his babes away he bears, His screaming partner following, and with speed Winged with the fears of death forsakes his home, Forsaken never to be seen again. And as he flies, behind him still he hears The crackling pines that tell the ruin near, Then sinks his heart when from some hill he sees His dear loved hut—his little rural wealth And all his hopes in one dread instant gone. Dreary the land whose commerce needs the chain Of winter to bind up her idle lakes, And wide extended fens impassable But on the sounding scate, when ev'ry stream That Lapland pours receives her hardy sons, While for his hide they chace the savage bear Through paths else inaccessible to man. In that dread season, when all winter sits Prone on the Arctic world, and buries deep Her towns in snow, and stills her roaring floods, Oft to the bosom of the Bothnick Gulph The Merchant gives his richly freighted sledge, Horses and servants, a long caravan, Over the stony deep, heaved up immense In many a hill, between whose dreary dells The traveller perplexed oft wanders far Amid the icy desart wild and wan, And hears aghast the distant roar below Of waves unfrozen, deep beneath the power Of winter's keenest rage, and though secure Trembles within, until at length revived He sees the recent track of other men, And with rekindled strength pursues his way To Aland wedded to her neighbouring shores. Oft when the frost has spent its utmost force And the disjointed sea in many an isle, Yielding to gentler skies and milder gales, Splits from the frozen coasts with horrid crash, Far on the floating desarts vent'rous go The Finnish peasants, where reposing lye The sluggish Phoce, and with heavy freight Return oft joyous from the perilous chase. But hapless they, who with th'advancing sun Pursue this trade, and to the faithless shore Of a bleak isle of ice, intent on prey, Moor their slight barque, if by a sudden squall Detached, perhaps upon some adverse coast She rushes; or between the closing steeps Of glassy mountains crush'd, she disappears, What then awaits?—despair alone awaits, And threatning death before them dreadful yawns: Upon the wide and agitated deep Borne frightful—'round them frowns the bitter sky, Beneath them roars the heaving element Wasting that faithless field that floats abroad Far from the coast. In silent woe they look Upon the dreary wilderness of waves, Which with encreasing rage tumultuous swells, But in that helpless moment of dismay, When hope is far removed, the helping hand Of all bestowing Providence is reached Is reach'd to save: Upon the utmost line Of the blue world, a dim ethereal speck At first seen doubtful, fills the stretching eye, Intent, with anxious vision fixt and scarce Can the strain'd ball collect th'unsteady form— It larger grows—a sullen evening gleam Shoots on the swelling canvas; now descried Some ship that northward with adventurous keel Plows the cold Arctic waves, where basks the whale His ponderous length, for which Batavia's sons Or Britons, lords of ocean, venture far Under the icy Pole— End of the Second Book.

Rivers; while to your inexhausted urns I pour this verse of mine, as wand'ring oft As are your courses, and by frequent stops Choked up and clogg'd, through which its sluggish way It slowly winds; how often have your streams Call'd to my mind the running stream of Life, That ceaseless flows? Though some with smoother flood Through fertile valleys glide and flow'ry fields, Rich in the umbrage of their verdant woods And wide extended lawns of emerald hue: Yet to the deep their shining currents lead With pace as certain and as true, as those That pour'd by nature on a steril soil Through rocks and desarts work their troubled way, Fractured and torn in many a rugged fall. Some Pilgrim-like with lonely footing slow Pace silent on—the social world and all The intercourse of man and busy life Forsaken—so the Cagar, saddest stream That waters eastern lands: Like merchants some, As Thames, or Avon famed thro' farthest climes, Where grew the reed immortal Shakspeare blew: Or as my native Lee, whose fruitful stream Bears on her azure breast the freighted fleets Of farthest lands—capacious to receive All Albion's floating castles, from the flaw Of sternest Boreas when he blusters most, Or Auster's blasts, with mountain billows heaved Dreadful before his sway, such as once drove The shattered navy of insulting Spain Upon Hibernia's shores, in that proud age, When great Eliza bore the scepter'd helm Of Britain, and the great Armada wide Her haughty flags unfurl'd, in dread array, O'er the Atlantic wave. The martial Rhine Thro' fields of iron and the frequent roar Of hostile ordnance rolls, inured to blood. And many more that near or far remote Refresh the earth and temper Phœbus' ray, Beneath the fervor of the burning line, Or through the vales of Erin's verdant isle. Now should we pass, o'er Africk's sultr'y climes, To where the Niger rolls his mighty stream With doubtful current, whether bent his course Or to the rising or the setting sun, Till one advent'rous man, thro' perils great And toil immense, hunger, and thirst, and pain, The question solved, and saw him eastward flow Majestic thro' his woods, and saw, besides, Upon his banks, the savage Moor usurp A haughty rule and bow the vassal necks Of Monarchs to the ground and on them tread. In this warm region where unclouded Sol, Walking his bright ecliptic, downward pours His rays intense upon the woolly crowns Of her black sons, who down the Gambia's stream Or Senegal, float yearly to augment The cries of slavery in foreign lands, And bleed, that Europe's pamper'd sons may glut On delicacies which their climes refuse. O! violated nature, every tie, Each fond endearment, every anxious wish, And every tender ligament that binds Man to his home, his country and his friends; Torn, cruel torn, while nature pours in vain The burning tear and heaves the heavy sigh. But Britain hears the hapless negro's groans, And bids him hope; throughout the western isles The tidings fly, and at the joyful sound The slave already drags a lighter chain. Yes, from thy senate, Britain, comes a voice That bids aloud the dreadful traffick cease, Bids human blood no more your commerce stain, Nor human flesh deform. Happy thine Isle, And happy he, who with unwearied zeal And truth in bright robed eloquence arrayed Pleaded the Captive's cause, and dauntless stood Th'unconquer'd champion of Humanity. Here, in the rudest state of social life, Within his simple hut, the native shuns Th'oppressive day, inactive till the call Of War arouse him, or the needful chace; Unknown to him the arts of polish'd states, Unknown their pleasures, but unknown their crimes. Or should we eastward bend our varying course To where the Nile his fruitful current rolls, Proud in the ponderous ruins that enrich His venerable course, whose Naiads late Hid their affrighted heads, with terror fill'd At Bronti thund'ring in Britannia's cause. But stay my reed this proud exulting strain, Another mood befits our alter'd state, Low on his funeral bed the victor lies, Bath'd and embalmed in a nation's tears. O! victory too dear, O! conquest won With too much price, that cost a Nelson's life, Sad Trafalgar beheld him from her cliffs, Beheld him conquer, and beheld him fall, While every white wave all bedrop'd with gore, That roll'd with boding murmurs to her strand, Brought some ill omen of the dreadful fight That sunk the naval hopes of France and Spain. What could they do, 'twas Nelson gave the word, And at the sound pale horror, from the poop Of every hostile ship that stood the brunt Of British fire, and Britain's hearts of oak, With trembling hand let fall the staff of war To grace the laurel'd ship that bore him home. And see the Victory, with sails that bear The tatter'd records of that fatal day, Nears with her charge Britannia's sadden'd shore, And views her ports with mourning faces throng'd, While on his sun-burnt cheek the gallant tar Wipes th'involuntary, silent tear. What sound is that, by every crooked coast And hollow rock and every sandy bay Repeated shrill, from off the heaving main? It is the genius of the green sea flood, That mourns with Albion for her darling son, Making her moan to every hanging crag, And bleak protruding cape that round her isles Whitens contending with the ocean spray: And every wave that curls his azure head, From Calpe's rock or Gades, votive isle, To Kilda's solitary shore, and thence To Labrador, or from the stormy cape Of Terra del Fuego to the coast Of Coromandel and her towns conveys These mingled tidings, wide from coast to coast, Great Britain conquers, gallant Nelson dies, And both the victors and the vanquished mourn. Who walks secure amid those dreary heaps That the wide Thebais spread in ruin great, That scarcely seem the work of mortal hands, To see the pillar'd temples of her gods Worship'd in ignorance, and curious tince Her Hieroglyphicks dark, and perhaps less wise Than men suppose? Who through her desarts free From fear (lest ignorance with jealous eye Should mark his steps and thwart his fond design, To give his wondering countrymen the fruits Of all his toil) ventures in painful search Of precious relicks of Egyptian art, Huge heaps of sculptured granite rear'd aloft In frightful magnitude, the figures grim Of their proud kings—Sphynxes and Aqueducts, Or chisseled Sarcophagi to enrich The storied volume? Who that parching faint With lengthen'd travel 'neath the downward ray Of burning Phœbus, by Tentira's walls Or far Philoe's isle but fondly turns His anxious thoughts to climes of kinder soil, And thinks of shrubby vales, and cooling rills, Left far at home, perhaps in Britain's isle Or green Hibernia? What to him avails, That Egypt, once the cradle of the arts, Gave to the world the early lessons bright Of science, and imparted first to Greece, By Cadmus thither sailing, the rude marks Of thoughts made visible, thence letters call'd? Around him spreads inhospitable wild A dreary desart, comfortless and void, No friendly cup invites his burning lip, No roof his weary limbs; reflecting sad He calls her cities from the grave of time, Her crowded ports and marts of foreign ware, Thebes with her hundred gates, Abydos, Coptos The great Arabian empory, Syene, And Sait the refuge of the son of God Sojourning there, when Herod in his rage Made childless many a mother, and the voice In Bethlehem was heard of loud lament. Within his mind, revolving sad the change, Of earthly glories and of mortal things, Views in their pride the Persian and the Mede, The old Assyrian Monarchy, the thrones Of mightiest kings from Nimrod in his race To Sardanapalus feeble in his sway Yet resolute to die amid his wealth, When false Arbaces laid unnatural siege To Nenevah,—the proud Chaldean too The Turcomanian Soldans, and their state, Who trod on gems, their towns of gorgeous wealth, The golden Altuncala seat of kings And Tefflis by the coward Georgian host Forsaken, when the troops of Amurath Marched 'gainst the Persian, by Mustapha led. The Colchian towns and Susianian south Of monarchs the proud seats, Sybaris first, And Dioscurias, in whose spacious mart Were heard three hundred tongues, where Rome maintain'd As many learn'd interpreters to expound The languages her various merchants used From many a distant land collected here To vend their wares. Nor Ulai forgets, Ulai, whose walls with golden cement join'd, (Where proud Ahasuerus wasted vain, Six months in feasting his intemperate peers,) Were by the Macedonian Robber erst destroyed. And many more in long perspective lost Of dark antiquity, the royal domes Of puissant princes filling with alarm, Wide empires, spreading far and near their sway, Pouring their fierce battalions on the heads Of weaker sovereigns, then sick of thought And of the feeble state of human things He sits desponding on old Nilus' shore. There in the reedy shoals, a dreadful length, The crocodile reposes, hideous beast; Less dangerous to be encounter'd far And dreaded less, than the deputed slaves Of lawless Chiefs, rapacious and austere, To those who journey on his slimy banks: Where still the bloody and uplifted rod, Of tyranny, that strikes at whom it may Without controul, held by the haughty Turk, Rules with oppressive sway the subject land. Unhappy men, whom the capricious brow Of some hot lord, with arbitrary nod, To suffer dooms, or condescends to save! Unhappier fair to worst of slavery doom'd, Unhappier, whom superior charms adorn, Forced oft by cruel custom to submit To the cloyed passion of some feeble wretch, Immured and wasting all their lovely prime, Shut from the world where nature gave them charms To be its sweetest blessing, and receive From man their homage due, respect and love, And be his solace in life's rugged road! Britannia hail! thrice blest in tripple pow'r Poised into equal rule; whose sons are free, And daughters heavenly fair, may'st thou long stand Impregnable to every foreign force, Within in peace secure, with plenty crown'd, Steady amidst the dread surrounding din, That all embattled Europe shakes throughout, And reign the mistress of the watr'y world. Still more unhappy are the ardent climes Where never in the thirsty traveller's ear Murmurs the rill soft trickling, nor the hum Of vernal bee delights; where leaf or flow'r Is never seen, nor blade of verdant grass Blesses the earth, white in eternal sand Wide glistening far a weary trackless waste, Such as from Guanziga stretches on To eastern Zaoula by the barbarous feet Of dreary Atlas: Or that Libyan wild Where Ammon's temple stood in times of old, The high Oasis, by the wandering tribes Of tented Arabs in pursuit of prey, Trod frequent down from Barca to the Nile, Whom oftentimes encamp'd old Memphis holds Amid her ruins: Or that desart space Of Chamo by the swarthy Tartar known: The stony Araby, or such as bounds The rosy Indus and her fruitful vales And far o'er Persia desolate extends Of sand or salt, reflecting burning suns, Pass'd only by the lazy caravans, Who, journeying up from Indian Agra north By Ispahan and toward the Caspian shore, Oft perish by insufferable drought. Ah! what avails their deeply loaded store Of pond'rous wealth and hoarded provender Of date or luscious fig, if water fail And the last cruise a stinted portion yields To quench the burning fever in the the blood? But in less dreary and inclement lands, Where many a city lifts her tower'd head, Amid her porticos some princely mart The absent river mourns, or cooling spring, And from the distant stream, o'er rock and vale And sun-burnt plain, the ponderous aqueduct, The work of ages, pours the scanty rill To the great multitude within, who draw From marble founts the cooling treasure forth. But if all-pow'rful Phœbus dry the source And the long duct becomes a dusty road, What can supply the loss? Deep through the sand Or the hard granit they industrious bore Where lies the expected spring, retired far 'Neath numerous strata, which if haply found, Is insufficient to the mighty draught. Or if some general invest her walls With desperate siege; and having idly plied His battering engines 'gainst her bulwark'd tow'rs With ineffectual parallels thrown up, Cuts off her waters—vain her mural strength And long artillery in deadly rows On bastion, or tenaille, or counterguard, Ravelin, lunet, or crown impregnable, And lined with faithful troops inured to bear Long warfare, and the hardships that attend The soldier's painful trade. Along the walls Crawl the pale citizens, and fell disease, That o'er the city spreads her baleful wings, More than the sword cuts off their marshall'd force, Until at length by hard condition urged The weary chiefs capitulate, and lo! What the long cannon or the fell petard Could not effect, ope the reluctant gates, And let the conqueror in. Dire was the fate Of Crissa proud, whose impious sons assail'd Apollo's temple, and the sacred grove Of Delphi and her altars stain'd with blood. Nine years before her walls the marshall'd pow'rs Of seven confederate cities hopeless lay With fruitless siege prolonged and wasted strength By pestilence swept off and help delay'd Of needful provender, and warlike stores, 'Till that wise Coan who, as story tells, Warn'd by the sacred oracle to aid Eurilochus and heal his fainting troops, Marking where under ground into the town, By conduit deep convey'd, the water ran, The secret spring defiled with pois'nous juice Pouring with hand abhorr'd into the stream Mortal infusion of pernicious herbs: Thence swell'd their graves with dead and thinn'd their ranks. Accursed deed! how many lay exposed In open air, a prey to birds, while some Crept into holes and sewers, their swelling frames Previous interr'd, the parent from the child Infected ran, the son his aged sire Forsook, ev'n medicine its pow'rs denied, Physicians fell administ'ring to the sick, Vain sacrifice they offer, vain implore Their gods to turn aside the dread decree The pious minister before the shrine Dies ere the sacred office he performs, And all is death and terrible dismay And ruin wide, 'till vengeance glutted deep Reposes on the havoc it had made, And sheathes the sated steel. How fell of old The mistress of the world, great Babylon? By labouring foes her proud Euphrates turn'd To water other plains, her ancient course Forsaking dry, hence Cyrus thro' her walls, Else inaccessible to martial force, Pour'd in a multitude, and razed her tow'rs By Ninus or Semiramis adorned, To the fallacious worship dedicate Of heathen Ops or Belus; from whose heights, Chaldean Priests the mystic rolling mark'd, And fain would hear the harmony divine Of that bright multitude of spheres disposed In tuneful order, by the unerring hand Of wisdom infinite, and, not content To gaze and wonder, saw or seem'd to see, In all their motions, rising or decline, Aspects malign or favourable, thought To influence men below. Water, chief good, Prime nourisher of every vital thing That round creation moves, not Phœbus self More necessary is to life, whose kindling beam Gives life to all; for not by thee asswaged In kindly falling dews and vernal drops (Parents of roses and the painted tribes That hedge and hill array and every dell) This chequer'd round of verdant wood and lawn Were a hard desart, void, and without shade. Lo! insufficient in thy praise am I And weak to sound thy wond'rous virtues forth, Yet with such feeble essay as I may Full of thy worth with vent'rous stop I try, This humble lay to thee, father of streams And this rude quill, with wildly warbled notes, In grove or grot, in sun or summer shade, I tune, or meditate some future strain, As musing oft I rove, my evening walk Extending far along some silent vale, And court the muse in twilight's sacred hour. Again condensed and deepen'd in its course With slow majestic wave the river glides, Till interrupted by th'opposing weir With never ceasing roar it dashes down Over the ragged pavement, save what time Cold Winter lays his hand upon the streams And stills their murmurs, and each vocal rill, (That chimed the live-long summer to the woods And rocky coverts dark, sweet to the ear Of musing shepherd, stretch'd at noontide hour,) Makes tuneless and the Naids leaves to mourn Their silent urns. Then too the River shrinks, And deep incumber'd in his frozen bed Murmurs below. Here, when the season calls, The fisher comes, and with deep searching hook, A cruel trade, from the insidious hatch Forth into mortal light, well-pleased, uplifts The struggling salmon stain'd with sudden gore, Gaff'd in his silver side upon the barb He writhes in agony, a helpless prey, His quivering sin and body slow convulsed Denoting life, and pain, to linger there Still undulating with the dying pang. Here too at times accumulated rains Prevent the fisherman's expected prize, And one dark moment frustrates all his hopes; For when bleak Auster, from his streaming wings, Shakes down a torrent on the subject plains, High o'er his banks the river lifts his head, Foaming and fierce, and rolls with fury on Precipitate, and flashes o'er the weir, Nor can the pond'rous masonry resist Th'impetuous torrent, but at once gives way Press'd, yielding, sinking, 'neath the tyrant flood. Then to its rage a dreadful chasm is ope'd, And down the waters rush, black, smooth, and deep, Sweeping away the crumbling ruin forth, Cast far and buried in the whelming sand. Up dart the salmon tribe and swift away Into the upland streams direct their course, By nature taught and powerful instinct warn'd In season due to seek the sandy brook, There to deposit in its fruitful bed The pregnant spawn, which with the vernal show'r Comes down a shining multitude and fills The river far and wide. Then thronging come Of youth and age a joyous group prepared To catch the greedy prey, and every bank With longing eyes they fill—innumerous lines Fly to and fro, from many a hand unskill'd, And oft entangled, dire contention breed. But what avails, if sudden rains bestow Through the broad weir an easy passage forth, For numerous foes await them with the rod, And not a rill but with new danger teems Of treacherous mesh, or snare, or barbed steel, More cruel far than all, for oftentimes At dead of night, the peasant youth approach, With flaming reeds, the river's silent bank, Where far below the expected salmon lies, And with the deadly spear unerring pois'd Deep in the stream transpierce th'unshelter'd prey; With stupid terror seized to see the stream With sudden flash illumed, and all around A frightful gleam pervade his low recess, Close to the bottom he awaits his fate That soon the well-directed barb conveys, Which having pierced his burnish'd body through Grates in the sand below, then draws him forth A mangled burthen, bleeding to the bank. Be not forgotten in recounting all The various sports (if sports they may be called) That the long river in his course bestows, How, at the slimy foot of some deep quay, Or at the weirs wide base in summer eve, Oft have I seen with patient eye intent (Ignoble pastime) the sly poter stand Knee deep in mud, and treacherously invade The stony dwelling of the Eel, with bait Insidious thrust inviting to his lip, And drag the slippery prey in anguish forth. Others remain unsung deserving less In verse to flow, of more ignoble kind, Ungrateful to the muse, who more delights Of nature and her wonderous works to sing. Now cultivation o'er the river sides Throws her green mantle, and diffuses sweet The odorous breath of roses, and the hills Crowns with the weaving grove's luxuriant wreath Here gardens glow, and frequent villas rise, Fill'd yearly by the wealthy citizens, Who from the busy counter hither haste, To trim the border, or the bower entwine, Or scarce exoticks or good cabbage rear, As taste or humour prompts or prudence bids, Such and so different the pursuits of men. To each his joys, some from the city haste, Sick of its bustle and the tedious round Of dull insipid routs and midnight feasts; Eager to taste the sweets of rural ease, They seek the humble hind's obscure retreat, And see a charm in every object round, The daisied slope, the hedge, the summer seat Beneath the thorn, and even the rural toil Is full of pleasure, soon the hovel wears A look which indicates, that not within Sits pining want and pale neglected age, A half fed progeny that num'rous croud The scanty meal, and care, and hopeless toil: A smoaking table every day invites And gen'rous wine, nought that the town can give Is wanting to supply the rural board, On richest fare by careful hands prepared They feed, and sleep on beds of softest down, And think they share the pleasures of a cot. Here, 'neath the shelter of these willows, bathe The timid fair, committing to the stream Full many a lovely form of fairest hue, Such as upon my native banks conceal'd Bare many an ivory foot and court the wave On summer morn, for modesty and truth And every charm unrivall'd through the land. Not fairer sure can Britain's empire boast Nor through these favour'd isles more justly fam'd, For virtue woo'd, for constancy when won, Than those delicious maids, whom envied Lee Daily embraces in his azure arms. Avoid O youth, avoid the dangerous spot, Nor trust your vagrant steps where the warm nymph Displays unconscious of observing eyes The well proportion'd limb of glossy white And neck resplendent, far away retire Nor with unlawful gaze profane the shade That virgin modesty conceals, nor fire Nor steel exceeds sweet woman's softer power, She strong in beauty, so the Teian sings, More formidable far, than warrior arm'd With spear and shield, shall well revenge the wrong, And in your breast infix a deadly wound Giving perhaps your days and sleepless nights To ceaseless sighs of slow consuming love. How happy is the group, that play below Upon that level green in various sport, As youthful frolic prompts, or fancy leads, Full of the momentary rapture all, Ardent and giving every thought to play Careless of days to come. “Ah tell them not That they are men,” for soon, too soon alas! They know it well, and often fully share Sorrow, man's only sure inheritance. Now is the time when, parents should observe The rising bias of the infant mind, And give the timely check, which not to give May darken ev'ry future year, and doom To tears and vain remorse a life of shame. But if with gen'rous fire it early burn, Soft lure it forth with kind encouragement; For in his early toys is often seen The future man: Perhaps the kindling sparks Of excellence to come, in great design, That yet may flame transcendent through the page Of epic song, lurk in the tender breast, That palpitates if Milton strike the lyre, Or Homer sweep his sounding verse along, While on a slender quill he faintly tries To woo some gentle muse. The glowing mind That yet may bid the swelling canvas live; May deep inspect the fields of pathless air And measure just the glaring comet's course; Or dauntless in the search of other Isles, Far sprinkled o'er the wide expanse of sea, May trace the frozen bounds of Neptune's reign, Already dawns. Ev'n in his infant years, The future hero heads the mimic fight, Who foremost in the glittering ranks of war, May lead battalions 'gainst invading foes, Or in the burning van of naval fight, Directing wise the terrible array, May turn to tears the boasted threats of Gaul And save his country. This, if well observed, Might oft facilitate the course of youth, Through science, and his early progress speed. Vain to encumber the too tender mind Against its bent, which cherish'd in its dawn May brighten into glory, wealth, and fame. Thus have I vent'rous with unskilful hand Traced the long river through its crooked course, And pleased perhaps no other ear but her's For whom alone I tuned this western reed; Pluck'd idly as may deem some graver head That deems all idle time not spent in gain Of worldly dross, and boasts to scorn the muse, Contented in the mental night that bounds His gross desires; but not for such I'll tune Nor for his praise, this silly pipe of mine Who, did I seek the meed my song might claim, And reach to pluck a laurel for my brow, Would cast a galling nettle on my head. Little remains to sing until we stop The Past'ral flute for the shrill tube of Mars, And sing of conflict dire and bloody deeds Atchieved in ancient days, unpleasant song. On yon bold prominence, around whose base Winds the broad river with unruffled course, A mighty castle rears its ancient walls Brown in the rust of time, sublime and sad With over-hanging battlements and towers And works of old defence, a massy pile. Within these naked Halls what silence now, Where once the roar of festive joy was heard And antique revelry, with swell of harps And minstrel songs of chiefs once great in fight, Now seldom visited, but by the few Who in such deep retirement love to sit, (Far from the walk of mirth at times remote) And muse upon the ever changing round Of earthly things, and in these ruins see The fall of empires and the fate of kings. Here once, as legendary story tells, Lived Desmond, rich in many a wide domain, And bleating flock, and herd of fruitful kine, Nightly secured, for in those ages rude By force not law men held uncertain wealth, And neighbouring chiefs, for plunder or for pride Their vassals mustering, on each other's pow'rs Waged petty war; hence all those tall remains Of former strength, that mid' our verdant fields Stand venerable, by th'enquiring eyes Of curious men oft seen, whom ancient lore And relicks of the times long gone delight. Desmond a daughter had, sweet as the morn, Whom many a petty potentate had sought With honourable suit, but Brune obtained The love of Aunagal, a youthful chief Of princely lineage and wide domain. A neighbouring Prince, O'Connor, hot with rage At offered love disdained, determines quick By force to seize the maid, and levies round A numerous force; and in those early times Not rude in warlike arts, for spear and bow They well could exercise in distant fight, Or in close conflict point the bloody skein; Full use they had of every active limb, Not cramped, nor stiffen'd by luxurious ease, But firm to bear the hardships of the field, And resolute in every danger they, Whether to harass a retiring foe, Or in retiring patient to endure; A hardy race, and able to perform Great deeds of manly strength, in manly strife. Marshal'd with horse and foot O'Connor sends A desperate threat to Desmond, who prepares His extreme force the chieftain to resist, Who now is on his frontier, and proceeds To waste with fire and sword. Soon on the field Desmond appears in arms, but cautious leaves A chosen band to guard his castle, where Entower'd close the lovely maiden wept Her father and her love with ceaseless tears. All day in conflict fierce and doubtful fight They dyed the field with mutual slaughter red 'Til Desmond fell, feeble in hoary age, And Brune retreats beneath the castle walls Determined there to try (or perish brave) The worst that fortune in her frowns may do, And long the fight maintain'd with desperate rage, Till night soft closing, Connor seem'd to fly With loss of men and horse cut numerous off, But to the woods retired; and ere the dawn Determines furious by one bold assault, To win the castle, and in silence now The troops approach, no clank of steel is heard, Whisper'd from rank to rank the orders fly, They trail their spears, and ranged in mute array Come in long file, close by the river's side. Meanwhile within the castle walls close throng'd Needful refreshment Desmond's troops receive, And due repose after the toil of fight, While Brune with words of comfort soothes his bride Who wails her aged sire, when loud alarm Of horn and shout is heard, the scouts return Precipitate, and, through the hall, the news Of Connor at the gate re-echoes round. Behold them in their haste, how throng'd; how loud The buz of hasty preparation; quick With spear or bow snatch'd up they sally forth, The gates can scarce discharge them in their speed, Their armours clash and bow strings intertwine, Forth like a swarm they rush, whose hive some swain Disturbs at evening tide, or that wise race The frugal ants, their small republic crush'd By labouring peasant's steel. The groans of death Numerous around denote the conflict dire, 'Til Brune with Connor meets whose arm he sought, And now a fight, such as no modern times Ee'r saw, between the furious chiefs ensued: They met with spears, but in the plated folds Of Brune's tough shield the spear of Connor rang, Who now defenceless, death expected quick; But Brune, disdaining victory so gained, His, cast indignant down, and bade approach His rival, who now, by the moon's broad orb, Which on the face of Brune shone full, descried His foe's majestic front and manly form, And thus addressed the chief—“Full well young prince “Dost thou deserve the beauty which thou seek'st; “Were it from any but O'Connor's arm “Thou'dst win the prize—but honor pride and shame “Forbid me to resign my right—advance—” Approaching both, few steps, they drew their blades, Flashing like meteors from their harness'd thighs, Each was a span in breadth, which now upraised Gleam'd horrible athwart the moon-light beam Like the long streaks which, in the northern sky Darting their fires, are by the untaught hinds The portents dire of bloody fields believed. Now on the chiefs all turned their eyes, and stay'd The busy conflict, and in silence stood Waiting the issue of so dread a fight, 'Til Connor fell, deep gored with gaping wounds, And, ere the morn look'd pallid from the east, His mourning host retired. Here oft the aged shepherd tells the tale, And circumspect points out each famous spot, Where battle raged, and where the chief was slain, Full of the wond'rous deeds of former men, Whose mighty stature oft the delver shows In mould'ring bones thrown from the furrow'd field. The river now denotes the city near, Its banks no more the calm retirement yield, And to my ear the buz of commerce comes And din of numerous wheels, and tolling bells That tell the hour, or warn us of the grave But warn in vain. Now to yon smoaky den, Where the blue spires scarce overlook the cloud, Let us retire, dull night comes on apace, And weary lids demand the pillow's balm, Till morning call us to the fields again, With new trim'd reed, to blow some rural strain.
