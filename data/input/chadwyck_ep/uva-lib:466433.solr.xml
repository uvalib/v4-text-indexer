      <field name="fulltext">STUDIES FROM THE ANTIQUE. THE EUMENIDES: A VISION OF THALES. I, Thales, sitting on the seat of Judgment, And striving to distinguish Truth from Falsehood, To uncoil the tangled knot of human Error, And solve the riddle of capricious Fortune, Beheld a vision. Suddenly before me, Instead of busy mart and swarming people, I saw on level of mine eyes, uplifted, A mountain summit, bathed in light Eternal, With sharp cold pinnacles of ice and granite, 'Mid which there stood, each touching close the other, Three thrones of adamant with golden footstools, And on them seated three celestial maidens, In robes of grey, with crowns upon their foreheads, And in their pale white hands three silver sceptres. Most beautiful they were, but sad and solemn. Their brows were heavy with supernal wisdom; Their deep dark eyes shone passionless and star-like, As if the great world-pageant spread beneath them, And mirrored in their orbs, were but the shadow Of mighty purpose hidden in the silence Of their inscrutable will, on which for ever And evermore they turned their inward glances. Serene and calm they seemed, and yet most mournful; As men might be if God had given them knowledge Of misery to come, but had denied them All right or power to lessen or avert it. I gazed with aweânot terrorâat their presence, And saw, beyond the peak, revolving slowly, A mighty wheel, that seemed of mist and vapour, Built up intangible. Unceasing ever, It rolled and whirled. And I beheld the maidens Moving each one her foot, as on a treadle; And, dimly glittering in the icy sunshine, And slender as the gossamer web, dew-laden, Three filmy threads, that met beneath their foot-stools, And turned the shadowy wheel through storm and sunshine. Suspicious of my reason, or mine eyesight, I watched; and suddenly, with dull effulgence, Red as new iron beaten on the anvil, It glimmered into shape and palpable substance; Then, bursting into flame from tire to axle, It lighted Earth and Heaven with crimson glory, Too dazzling for mine eyes. I shut them slowly, And when I looked again the clouds had gathered, And the great wheel revolved in mist and darkness Impalpable, and ominous of evil, Huge as a planet wandering from its orbit, Foreboding plague and war or coming chaos. The three calm sisters saw me not, nor heeded: But gazing there alone, and sore bewildered, I felt the need of human speech and counsel, And found them suddenly. Beside me standing, Partakers with me of the heavenly vision, I saw a little child, a five-year infant, With mild blue eyes and hair of golden lustre; A youth in prime of over lusty vigour; And an old man, bowed down with care and sorrow, And hoary with the weight of eighty winters. âSee!âsaid the child, and plucked me by the garments, âHow beautiful they areâthe lovely maidensâ Smiles on their lips and crowns upon their fore-heads!â The young man shuddered; his right hand was bloody: I saw the stains of murder as he raised it To cover up his eyes. âTheir hair is snaky, Their looks assassinate, their breath is poison, They read my inmost secrets to denounce me. Oh! let me fly to darkness and the Desert, To Hell itself, if only to escape themâ The furious, terrible, avenging Horrors!â The old man sighed: âThey look on me reproachfulâ They speak to me, although thou canst not hear them, And tell me of my miserable errorsâ My promise unfulfilledâmy glory tarnishedâ My opportunities misused, perverted, And lost for ever! More than this; they tell me Of grievous wrong committed, unatoned forâ Of life that had no object but indulgence In selfish passion. I would die most gladly If they would only cease to look upon me, And let me pass into the quiet Hades, As the stone sinks into the deep sea caverns, And lies untroubled and forgot for ever.â âBehold the sisters three!âa soft voice whispered, Far in the upper air, or in my spirit: âBehold the Fates! the dreadful yet auspicious; Regents of Earth and Heaven, of Man and Nature; Good to the good, and terrible to the wicked, Just and inflexible. Behold, and fear not!â I bowed my head in silent adoration, And questioned of myself the secret meaning Why they were three? The same still voice respondedâ âThree but yet one:âthe tree, the grass, the flower Have but one nature and one law to guide them; The beast hath twoâthe physical and mental; But man, their lord, hath three.âThreefold in function, Threefold in attributeâthreefold obedience He oweth to the gods;âand he who blindly, Rashly, or wilfully is false to either, Must pay the penalty in pain and sorrow. Who breaks the physical law, that law condemns him; Who breaks the intellectual, sins and suffers; And who the moralâhighest law of natureâ Must bear the heavier punishment decreed him By Fateâthe Law of God that changes never.â The still voice spake no moreâmy soul was silent, And lifting up my head from mine abasement I looked around; and lo! I sat in judgment On mine accustomed seat, and heard around me The murmur of the people.âHeed the vision, Ye who come up to me to plead for Justice! Those who miscall the pleasant Fates, the Furies, Condemn themselves. The Fates are as we make them. ASTRÃA; OR, THE DEPARTURE OF THE GODS. There passed a shadow on the noonday sun, And all the populous cities of the East Poured upon housetop, tower, and battlement Their countless multitudes, to watch and pray. The mountaineer stood sunward on the cliff, Or knelt in terror as the shadow grew; And fear-pale shepherds gathered on the plains, And smote their breasts, or whispered, each to each, Of mighty change, and prophecy fulfilled. From deepest gloom of overhanging boughs Came the scared foresters to open glades, That they might gaze upon the ominous Noon; And having seen it, cover up their eyes To wait in darkness the impending stroke Of vague, unknown, inevitable Doom. Far on the Euxine and Egean seas Adventurous sailors, hopelessly becalmed, Looked at the useless helm or idle sail, And called upon the gods of wave and wind, And sea-nymphs, hidden in their coral caves, To aid them in extremity forlorn:â The gods and nymphs had sorrows of their own Keener than mortal griefs, and heard them not. There was a sense of pain upon the world: Wild beasts grew tame for terror; timid birds Flew to men's bosoms for security; The trembling lion herded with the kine; The flow'rets closed their petals; and the leaves And pendulous foliage of the forest trees Quivered no more, but hung as carved in stone. The darkness gathered;âdarker at full Noon Than in the dense opaque of starless night; And all the people of all climes and tongues, Moaned infant-like, and wrung their clammy hands, Or lay upon the sward as they were deadâ Save a few priests, and sages, and old men, Who hoped or prayed; and some few babes that slept. Light broke at last; a sudden haze of beams: Lurid and fitful;ânow like tongues of flame, Speaking in thunder; now like blazing stars Cast from their place, and reeling to the Earth, For fellowship of ruin; now like swords Unsheathed, titanic, from Orion's belt, And splintering into comets as they clashed; Now shooting up o'er all the western sky In one pale, solemn, luminous Cross of Fire That filled the Universe with tender light, And made men hopefulâthough they knew not why. It gleamed, it shone, it dimmed, it disappeared, But left behind o'er all the purpling Heaven The mellow twilight of a coming Day, On which were shadowed as on Magic Glass Phantasmal multitudes, and warring hosts Of stature hugeâhuger a hundred-fold Than white-peaked Atlas, Alp, or Araratâ Who wheeled, and reeled, and struggled hand to hand For mastery and dominion, and sole power Over the Earth and Men. Perchance for Truth, Perchance for Falsehood, strove the combatants; But whether Truth or Falsehood, Right or Wrong, The means were blood and sorrow; and the end New agonyâand still recurring war. Again the Cross of Fire shot up through space, Shone for a moment, and was lost from sight In rolling cloud and uttermost eclipse; And men were conscious of lament in Heaven, And wail on Earth; of mournful words that swoll Upon the feverish pulses of the wind, And seemed to shape themselves in human speechâ âFarewell for ever! we return no more!â 'Twas the foredoomed departure of the gods From Earth to Heaven:âhis high Olympian seat Zeus had forsaken; and the Age of Gold, When mortal with immortal might commune, Had passed for ever. From the upper air And from the darkened orbit of the sun, Jarring in thunders, came the mournful voice Of grey-haired Saturn; then Apollo spake, With louder grief that shook the tuneful spheres; Then Hera and the blue-eyed Diomed; But Aphrodite, sorrowing more than they, Framed into speech their passion and her own, Her voice all tremulous and choked with tears: âFarewell, farewell, to suffering human kind! Farewell the flowery islands of the sea, The hill-tops, and the valleys, and the groves; Farewell the temples and the oracles, And teeming cities where our praise was sung, At morning and at evening sacrifice; Farewell for ever! we return no more!â On the sea-beach, and far from sight of land, Was heard a murmur. Men who strove to pierce The mournful mystery, and translate in words Articulate, the music of the moan, Imagined they beheld Poseidon's robe Trailing its sea-green folds upon the wave, And fading formless into clouds and mist As the voice spake: âFarewell, O pleasant sea! O joyous waves! O billows of the rock! O flowery shore, and amber-coloured sands! Farewell for ever! we return no more!â Through long-green archways of the ancient woods, Rising amid the grasses and the flowers, And mounting to the tree-tops like a breeze That has a fancy to become a storm, Sounded a plaint, confused and intricate, Of mystic voices blending into one. Pan and his once rejoicing brotherhood Of Faun and Satyrs, joyous now no moreâ Pan and his buoyant nymphs of bower and stream, Dryad and Nereid, sore discomforted, Seemed to commingle in one long low chant, Harmonious and melodious all their pain. âFarewell!âthey said, âa long and last farewell To dells and valleys, once our happy homes! Farewell, farewell, companionship with man, And dance with mortal maidens on the sward At vintage time, when Earth is blue with grapes! Farewell, the thymy wilderness of hills Where we have sported many a summer day And quaffed the juice that Dionysus gave, With flashing eyes and wine-empurpled lips! Farewell, Dodona and the sacred oaks! Farewell, the myrtle groves, and every tree That we have loved and dwelt in from old time, Free, tho' imprisoned! Farewell, lakes and streams Translucent as the sky, where at hot noon We've floated lily-like, or dived like birds, And shook the sparkling moisture from our limbs, And dived again, or floated, face to heaven, Our long hair rippling on the rippling waveâ Farewell for ever! we return no more!â âAlas, poor Earth! alas, poor human kind!â Said a sweet voice, clear echoing o'er the sky; âWhat shall be done, if all the gods depart And leave you to your wickedness and shame? What shall be done when Love's bright flame is dimmed, And Beauty tarnished, Joy made sickly pale, Religion's self converted to a Trade, And Lust and Anger, Hate and Selfishness, Left without curb, to riot unrestrained, Uncared for by the gods? Alas! alas! This may not be!âThough gods and goddesses And all the heroes of the Golden Age Are fled for ever, Hope shall not depart: AstrÃ¦a shall remain! Rejoice, O earth! For Justice shall be with you evermore; The Wrong shall not be victor over Right Without the penalty, twin born with crime; The weak shall not be victims of the strong Without God's remedy! Clear, darkening Heaven! Smile out afresh, thou long-dejected Day! Look up, ye nations, and be sad no more, AstrÃ¦a lingers in her ancient haunts, Queen of the world, as in the olden time, To aid the weak, to succour the oppressed, And vindicate the justice of the gods!â The darkness clearedâthe Sun looked forth from Heaven, The gods no more lamented; and men's hearts Were lightened of an agony and fear, As mild AstrÃ¦a spake, with tearful eyes, And heavenly sympathy for erring men. But never since that melancholy day Has Nature smiled as brightly as before. Beauty received a blemish and a taint, And Love, th' immortal, though immortal still, Sullied its purity with worldly thought: The Golden Age had lapsedâthe Iron came. ACANTHA. Lusty Apollo, casting off his glory, Too fierce for mortal eyes to bear unblinded, Robed his immortal limbs in human beauty, And came to Hybla on a morn of summer, Where young Acantha roamed in thymy valleys, Tending her milk-white goats and gathering honey. The god beheld her, and his pent-up passion Shot lightnings through his eyes and through his pulses, And quivered through his speech in waves of music. She, coy and cold, affected not to see him, And turned her dreamy glances to the daisies, As if she'd read them to discover Fortune. âBlue-eyed Acantha! Listen to my wooing! Long have I sought thee o'er the upland pastures: I've found thee oft, but never found thy favour, Or caught one smile to bid me hope anotherâ Wintry in heart, but Spring-like in thy beautyâ Burst into perfect Summerâsweet Acantha! âFair-haired Acantha! Listen to my wooing! There's not a shepherd boy in all our Hellas Can swim or wrestle, dance or sing, as I can; But dance and song are idle to my fancy. The cool waves tempt me not, and sports oppress me And all because thou'rt coy to me, Acantha! âRose-lipped Acantha! Listen to my wooing! Fairest of maids, and brightest, though unkindest, I have a bower, deep hidden on Parnassus, Where I will feed thee upon milk and honey, And love thee more than mortal tongue can tell thee, If thou'lt be mine, as I am thine, Acantha! âSnow-browed Acantha! Listen to my wooing! Thy name and beauty shall be sung for ever, In merry roundelays of happy lovers, Or in the plaintive songs of nursing mothers. The star of maidsâthe paragon of matronsâ If thou'lt be kind, and smile on me, Acantha! âBalm-breath'd Acantha! Listen to my wooing! And if my youth, my song, my faith, my passion, Avail me not, lo! at thy feet behold me! No shepherd-poetâbut a King and warrior; And thou shalt be my Queen, and reign for ever, Sceptred and thronedâmy beautiful Acantha!â He kneltâthe God of Lightâbut she repelled him. âI've had a dream,âshe said, âand I believe it, That I shall be beloved of great Apollo; And till he come, although I may not love him, I cannot listen to the voice of wooer;â Shepherd or King, I'm equally above thee.â Slowly he rose, and looked upon her sadly. âShe that can scorn true love for sake of glory Deserves not love and priceless fond affection. Thou hast been offered heart beyond thy knowing, And song the immortal;âboth hast thou rejected, And grasped a shadow!âdesolate Acantha!â He touched her on the forehead with his finger, And looked upon her lovingly one instant; Then blazing on her in his full effulgence, She perished ere her fair blue eyes could twinkle, And on the greensward lay a heap of ashes: And the god sighed, âO loved, but lost Acantha! âBeautiful stillâarise from earth's kind bosom A little flower; and when mankind behold thee, They'll own thee lovely as thou wert when woman, But love thee not. The shepherd boy deplores thee, And o'er thy leaves the poet weeps for pity, But the god punishes! Forlorn Acantha!â MARSYAS. A MIGHTY minstrel on a morn of summer Came to Arcadia, singing songs divine; And all the people gathered from the pastures, From dale, and mead, and brambly mountain side, And from the flowery banks of blue Meander, From hamlets, and from villages far scattered; From mill and smithy, mart and portico; And from the green recess of grove and forest, Came young and old, the merry and the mournful, The thoughtful and the thoughtless, high and lowly, And all to listen to a Poet's song. O song, divinest ever breathed to mortal! It caused the eye to glow, the pulse to throb, The brain to reel with beauty and delight; It moved the barren heart to fruitful tears, And warmed the coldest blood to martial frenzy, Waking all passion and all mystery By touches masterful. 'T was now a storm, Rousing and chafing the quiescent sea To wrath sublime and thunderous hills of foam; And now a whispering breeze 'mid lily flowers, Breathing sweet odours and delicious calms. âThe mighty Poet! is he god or man?â Exclaimed the people. âIs he man or god, Who sings these songs, and sways us to and fro, Ev'n as he listeth? If he be a god, Let us kneel down and give him reverence! And if he be a man, of men the chief, Let us intreat him that he be our king: For lo! his words are wisdom, and his songs Fill us with thoughts too mighty for our speech, But clear in his, as planets in the sky. Lo, he is mighty! Let him be our king!â And thereat Marsyasâchief of critics heâ Spake to the crowd. âO foolish multitude! To be so smitten with an idle tune, Made for his pastime by a shepherd boy! He hath not studied in the schools of art! He cannot sing! his words are emptiness! His lyre is out of tune! and what he saith Hath been said better fifty times before. Go, idle boy! Dig gardens, plough the fields, Or tend the kine, and vex thy soul no more, Nor us, too busy in a world of care To give attention to thy songs or thee.â âThou fool!â;the poet said. âWho made thee judge, Or gave thee license to let loose thy tongue? Who judges poets should himself have won The garland and the crown. Who sounds the deeps Of mighty natures should have eyes to sean The lengthening line to which the plummet pends. Who measures heavenly harmony should hear The heavenly music in his own true soul. What hast thou done, presumptuous! or canst do? Sing, that the people who have ears to hear And hearts to feel may judge 'twixt thee and me.â Angry and scornful, Marsyas snatched the lyre, And struck the quivering strings with rude bold hand, And sang a limping song of Love and Wine, Misty and harsh, that jangled out of tune, Soulless as croak of frogs within the marsh, Or twittering beak of sparrows on a bough. And all the people laughed. The minstrel's eye Gleamed fiery wrath; his red lips curled with scorn; His stature doubled to heroic bulk; And all his visage brightened with disdain, And dazzled the beholders as he spake. âAnd this thing sits in judgment on the gods, And calls itself a critic! Fool! rash fool! Know 'tis Apollo's self whom thou hast scorned, And hear thy fate. Not for a poor revenge Unworthy of the poet or the god, But for example to thy kind and craftâ Example to be fresh till end of timeâ I flay thy skin from thy presumptuous flesh, And nail it to a tree to rot or tan, That gods and men may see the punishment Of envious churls and disappointed knaves, Who strive to trample genius in the mire, And hate the heavenly fire that warms them not!â Quick as with lightning flash the deed was done. The victim raised one agonising shriek, And then was mute for ever. On the tree The bleeding trophy hung; and ere the crowd Could draw one breath for wonderment of awe, Apollo's place was vacant, and the sky Shone with a slanting ray of purpled gold, On which he mounted, swift as light, to Heaven. THE WISH OF MIDAS. âO treacherous Silenus, foe, not friend! Take back, take back thy miserable boon, And let my bread be bread, or let me die. âWhen yestermorn I was befooled by thee, And took thy hideous gift, I could not know, I could not dream, the gods could be so false. âI thought thou wert my friend and comforter, And blessed thy name when, stretching forth my hand To touch the rose-red apple on the bough, Or pendent bunches of the purple grapes, They fell in yellow clusters at my feet: Gold! all of gold! no purer in the mart. âI blessed thy name when at the running stream I bathed my lips, and all the sparkling flood Rippled in golden waves before my sight. âI blessed thy nameâI justified the gods! Fool that I was! deluded that I am! That could not, and that cannot, sound the depths Of treacheryâthe gods' far worse than men's. âThe rain rained on me like a storm of spears, Each drop that touched me turning into gold, Heavy enough to batter me to death, Had I not hidden me in sheltering caves Until the venomous storm had fretted o'er Its overflow of wrath. âAh, woe is me! Not all the gold that grows beneath my tread, Or rattles from my hand, like falling shale When lightning strikes the cliff, and all the shore Is strewn with ruin; with the half of whichâ Ay, or the twentieth or the hundredth partâ I could endow perpetual monarchies, And make the meanest beggar more than king, Is worth the crust a beggar might disdain; No, nor one drop of water from the spring; Nor one delicious dew-drop on my tongueâ My tongue burnt up and shrivelled as with fire. âOh, let me drink one long, long, wholesome draught, And bathe my mouth in water ere I dieâ My face, my hands, my body, and my feet! Oh, let me drink and die! Drink is my heaven, The crown of all things, Earth's supremest joy, Worth all that mighty Zeus can e'er bestow! âWhat have I done to be so smitten down, Made lower than the beasts that munch the herb, Or vagrant birds that drink the running stream? The ox is happy with the juicy grass, The wolf can put his nozzle in the flood, But all the blessed moistures of the world Yield to me nothingâbut detested gold. âWhat have I done? Silenus, answer me! Let me not die with curses on my lips, As die I must, if thou, unmerciful, Wilt not take pity on my agony, And cease to mock me. Take, take back thy gifts! Or, if thou wilt not, then let Zeus down hurl His deadliest lightnings on my willing head. I crave not lifeâI wish to drink and die!â Thus Midas groaned and moaned, and lay him down Full length upon the sward, and cursed the gods, And clutching handfuls of the flowers and grass, Turned them, in desperate bitterness, to gold, Then flung them from him with intense disdain And fierce disgust. Silenus, peeping out From the vast bole of a rough-rinded oak Six hundred summers old, looked on and laughed, And held his fat round sides with growing glee; Then reeling forth as from a drunken bout, And holding high a flagon running o'er With blood-red wine, offered the tempting draught To wretched Midas. âWilt thou drink?â;quoth he. âOh, persecuting and infernal god, Leave me alone! I wish this hour to die, And never more to see thy bestial face, Unless thou wilt relieve me of my curse.â âNay,â;quoth Silenus, âif thou rail and scoff, How shall I give thee gifts? When beggars sue With hope of charity, they use fair words. And so, good friend! rich Midas! thirsty soul! If thou wouldst drink my wine, or bite my grapes, Be meek and humble as becomes thy need; Kneel, beggar, or I shall not pity thee!â âGreat as the gods, and far more merciful, Mighty Silenus! let me worship thee! Divine Silenus! let me kiss the ground Where thou hast trodden to behold my pain. I'd rather be the meanest husbandman, That earns and eats his honest daily bread, And cools his tongue with water, than I'd be Such base, abject, and miserable slave As now I am this moment at thy feet, Richer than fifty kings, and yet so poor As to be envious of the very swine That swill their greasy draff, and sleep in peace.â âDrink!â;quoth Silenus. âI recall my gift! Thy bread shall be thy bread, thy wine thy wine, Upon condition that I touch thine ears, And make them sprout and grow like ears of ass, Hairy and hugeâa warning evermore To fools like thee, who quarrel with the gods, And deem no blessing half so good as gold.â âGive me the cup,â;said Midas; âlet me drink! I'll take the punishmentâI'll bear the shame, And bless thee for thy bounty; but I pray Cheat me no more: I wish to drink or die.â He took the cupâhe drank a lusty draught, Long, lingering, luscious, every drop a joy That poured new life through all his clamorous veins, And knew 'twas wine. And though he felt his ears Shoot up and stretch at every grateful gulp Flexile and asinine, he was content. And when Silenus vanished, with a laugh That rang through all the wood, he sat him down And plucked the juiciest apples from the bough, And ate them greedily. âThe gods be thanked, Apples are apples, and my bread is bread. Let men or women scoff, to see mine ears, It shall not matter to my peace of mind; I thank the gods for water, not for gold, And bear my punishment as best I may.â PROTEUS. Alone upon the melancholy shore, Between the ebb and flow Rolling and surging evermore, Sat Proteus on a jutting rock Cushioned with tangle and sea-hairâ And listened to the moan and shock Of crested billows, white as snow, That flashed upon the sand-reach, smooth and bare, Their serried armour bright, Like mail-clad horsemen keen for fight, And mastery of the unoffending land; He sat, with chin supported on his hand, And mused on mysteries dim-seen, Even of immortal eyesâto men unknownâ The mighty riddle what the world might mean: Silent he sat, and all alone. And as he dreamed, his thoughts took bodily shape,â Fresh, fair, and buxom on the beach, Their fragile hands linked each in eachâ All happy to escape From buffeting and thraldom of the waves, And twilight of their ocean caves, The Oceanides came forth to play, Bare-footed in the light of day, And float their loose robes on the gale That bulged far off the home-returning sail. He heard the music of their dance, He saw their shiny feet upon the sand, Then wearied, he dismissed them with a glance And motion of his hand, And summoned in their stead, In her immortal lovelinessâsea-born, A thousand odours round her shed, Great Aphrodite, rosier than the morn, Richer than summer, sweeter than the spring, Brighter than day, kinder than gods or men; With love that held all nature in its ken, And overflowed on every living thing. And with her came each Muse and Grace, Radiant from Heavenâwith clear cerulean eyesâ And he beheld them face to face, And spake to them of mysteriesâ Of Love, the Regent of the skies, Lord paramount of all beneath the moon, Whom gods obey, and men adore, Whose praise Earth sings to sea and shore, While all the stars repeat the eternal tune, Love Paramount and Love for evermore. Anon he summoned by his voiceless will, There on the sea-beach salt and chill, Dodona's groves and odoriferous gloom, And Tempe's vale with all its wealth of bloom, Boeotia with its pastures green, Areadia with its mountain screen, Gardens and orchards, bosks and lawns, And joyous Pan, with all his nymphs and fauns. Loud o'er the wave their laughter rang, The wild deer gambolled, and the blithe birds sang, Till Proteus shut his eyes and waved them off From the denuded sands and bare sea trough; For he had communed with the gods too long, And his heart wearied with a yearning strong, For converse and companionship of mind, With erring, suffering, struggling human-kind. Obedient to his call Came lovely women in their joyous youth, Brave men, and sages who had died for Truth, Or lived to plant its banner on the wall; Came little children, ruddy as the rose, Came young Ambition with its brain of fire, Came old Ambition, withered in desire, But fresh for vengeance on opposing foes; Came jesters with their arrowy tongues gall-tipped, And grave buffoons, large paunched and heavylipped, Came kings and Pharaohs weary of their crowns, Envious of ploughmen who could sleep, Enviousâbut yet ashamed to weep At better fortune of contented clowns; Came beggars leaning on their staves; Came careless, uncomplaining slaves, And slaves in whose hot blood the slavery ran Like maddening poisonâgoading all the man To quick revolt;âcame Misery, gaunt and bare, Full of remorseful secrets;âcame Despair, Silent or querulous, or moaning low;â Came lovers laden with deep joy or woe; Came rich men, weary that they should endure Evils as many as the wearier poor; Came Youth that longed for death, and Age forlorn That clung to lifeâyet grieved that it was born. And Proteus saw and loved them, all and each, Imbibing knowledge from their pain, As trees fruition from the rain. And all that human agony could teach, Or human joy impart, He studied with full mind and fuller heart, Till he became a world, all worlds containing, And bore the heavy burden uncomplaining, And thought the thoughts, that throb and burn In all the planets as they turn, Thoughts immortal â universal â perfect as the spheres above, Death in Lifeâbut Life for everâand Eternity of Love. The wondering people gathered on the shore And watched the pageant as it rolled, Projected from his mind, and said, âBehold The many shapes he taketh evermore! He is not one, but many. Let us cry Aloud to rouse him where he sitteth dumb, And bid him speak to us, and prophesy Of glooms and glories of the days to come.â But Proteus, when he saw they would intrude Upon the full heart of his solitude, Gathered the vagrant mists around his face, And clad himself in cloud, and disappeared; And when again they looked upon his place, Watching the vapours as they curled and cleared, They saw him not; but heard, far off, at sea, A voice that said, âOh, men! ye know not me, And never can. What I may tell, I tell;â But seek not you to pierce the inscrutable: God's secrets are His own.â;Humbled and sad, They went their way, while from the white sea-rim, And all the shore, echoed a choral hymn Of mingled grief and joy. That song sublime Fills all true poets' souls; and shall till end of Time. BACCHUS AND EVANTHE. In crimson glory shone the mountain crest, The lengthening shadows pointed from the west, 'Twas summer eve in Aready the blest. Bronzed by the sun, with cheeks as red as wine, Upon a leopard-skin beneath a vine, Lay lusty Bacchus in the purple shine. Amid the clusters of his nut-brown hair, Round the meridian of his forehead fair, Circled the ivy-wreath that shepherds wearâ An ivy-wreath with roses white and red, Fresh gathered, moist with dew, their blooms unshed, Woven amid the tendrils round his head, By the deft fingers of a maiden sweet, Child of his love, who, watchful at his feet, Tended her father's couch on lowly seat. Lovely Evanthe! with dark eloquent eyes, And soft cheeks, blushful as the morning skies, And hair as black as grapes when summer dies. Upon the grass beyond him where he slept, Frolic and free, the lithe Bacchantes lept And danced and sang, and frantic revel kept. Dishevelled all, with bosoms purple-stained By overflow of flagons they had drained, They shrieked delirious joy, half-pleased, half-pained. Pan and his joyous Fauns, a roystering crew, Hairy as barley, gambolled o'er the dew, And raised from glade and copse the wild halloo. Some played the syrinxâsome the bugle keen, Or mellower flute that rippled in between;â The bounding satyrs struck the tambourine. Heavy Silenusâgreedier than the swineâ Leered on the sportive nymphs with lustful eyne, And reeled and hiccoughed from excess of wine. The revelry, the music, and the song Surged up in waves o'er all the festive throng, But Bacchus slumbered peacefully and long. And aye his little daughter watched his face, A star beside the moon, a breathing grace That shed a silvery lustre o'er the place. At length he wakened with a sudden start, And ere his heavy eyelids flashed apart, Knowing her there, he clasped her to his heart. For never yet, since earthly Time began, And wild-woods echoed to the voice of Pan, Did hero, demi-god, or mortal man, Or ev'n the gods themselves, love woman's child With love so fervent, true, and undefiled, As mighty Bacchus loved his daughter mildâ His own Evanthe, little dark-eyed maid, Nine summers old, in purity arrayed, Life of his heart, that pulsed but as he bade. He took her in his arms, and kissed her lips; Then shining forth like sun from an eclipse, That lights the dark sea and the flashing ships, He looked upon the revellers in their rout, And heard, in all the woodland round about, The song, the laughter, and the echoing shout. His little darling, eager to inquire, Gazed on the godlike features of her sire, Alight with majesty and heavenly fire, And asked him, taking courage as she spakeâ For in her heart the thought had lain awake All the long dayâa shadow on the lake Of her serene pure mind: âMy King! my Lord! My Father! thou so great and so adored, Tell me,â;she said, âwhy this unseemly horde, âWith bestial revelry and drunken brawl, Follow thy steps, and come without thy call, Boisterous and reckless, and degraded all? âWhy these Bacchantes, insolent and bold, These rude, rough satyrs, hideous to behold, And this Silenus, dissolute and old? âThou art all sunshineâthey like storm and cloud; Thou art all goodness, they a wicked crowd; Why do they follow thee, and shout aloud âIn honour of thy name, which they degrade?â And Bacchus smiled: âMine own, my little maid, Not much thou knowest in our greenwood shade âOf wide-world wickedness and mortal woe, Why lightnings flash, and why the tempests blow; And sweetest! fairest! may'st thou never know! âLet it suffice to learn that man, who deems His virtues perfect, knows not how he dreams, And that straight lines but lead him to extremes. âHis love becomes his lust, his prudence, fear, His courage, rashness; and his pride severe, Conceit and arrogance and scorn austere; âHis caution, cowardice; his justice, ire; His mercy, weakness; each uncurbed desire A spark to burn in desolating fire. âAnd I, my child, who long have taught mankind, How to enjoy the blessings that they find Spread o'er the world for body and for mind, âI, who have taught them how to plough the field, To tend the vines, and drink the juice they yield For strength and joyâfor stimulant and shieldâ âHave ever found them foolish and perverse: They know the better, but they choose the worse, And turn my choicest blessings to a curse. âThey use not, but abuse the gift divine, Degrade their manhood, and like senseless swine Grovel and wallow and go mad with wine. âSo, when in harvest-time I show my face In pastoral vale or busy market-place, To teach the crowd the dignity and grace âOf heavenly Temperance and healthful Use, I bring the bestial appetites profuse, In shape of Fauns and Satyrs running loose âIn drunken riot; the Bacchantes wild, And old Silenus, greedy and defiled, Example on example heaped and piled, âOf the deep sin and error of excess;â The people see; and while my name they bless, Shudder at vice and loathe its hideousness.â THE VESTAL FIRE EXTINGUISHED. Oh weep ye and lament, for woe is on us! Unutterable woe and guilty shame; The gods withdraw their faces from our altars: Our high name Is scorned and made a mockery of the nations! The fire is quenchedâthe old immortal fire That pointed skyward, pledge of our devotion And high desire, Hath left us for its Heavenly home, And we in darkness roam Round its cold ashes, cursed of gods and men, Until by tears and blood we light it up again. Oh weep ye and lament! The desolation Covers the land. No longer courage animates men's bosoms: No longer strength abides in the right hand; No longer love dwells in the eyes of woman, Or virtue in the soul of priest or king, Or hope in poor men's hearts, or children's fancies. There is a blight on every living thing, And shall be, till we re-illume The light amid the gloomâ The holy, holy, ever holy flame, Pure as the Heaven of Heavens from whence it came. Weep and lament in anguish of contrition! Let the unhappy maid Whom the gods chose to bring this misery on us, Come forth, arrayed In her white garments, veiled from mortal vision, To meet the doom that gods and men deeree; And let the multitude from night to morrow Bend the remorseful knee In the dark temples, moaning all night long, As the sea moaneth when the storms are strong; And weep, and rave, and pray That the sharp agony may pass away. Mourn and lament, upon your knees and faces! There must be sacrifice for evil done. Mourn and lament! Until this shame pass over We scandalise the sun, And are unworthy of his beams to ripen The corn, the olive, or the vine; Unworthy of the breath we breathe, Or any other gift of love divine. Kneel King and people! Kneel down lowly! And pray for light, the holy ever holy! Kneel down! kneel down! and strew your heads with ashes! Gird sackcloth on your limbs; And let your choral chants be turned to weeping And penitential hymns, Until the gods take pity on our sorrow, And give us back in pain The gift we scorned, or knew not how to cherish, In the glad days that may not come again. Light! Light! It burns! It glitters up to heaven! The blood is shed; The flame hath spread! Rejoice ye people! shout for joy! Light! light! we are forgiven! CHIRON. âLife! Life! oh give me life, thou parent Sun! That pourest it in floods in every ray From thy divine supernal countenance, That I may be coeval with thyself And look at Knowledge as I would at thee, Undazzled, unconsumed, insatiable! Life! Life! oh give me life, Eternal Sea! That borest Aphrodite in thy womb, Immortal as thyself! Oh give me Life That I may sail upon the waves of Time To havens of Eternity! Thou Earth! Dear Mother Earth! be kindly to thy son, And teach me, guide me, aid me, how to pluck The seeds of Knowledge scattered o'er thy breast, In weed and grass, and flower, and rind, and fruit, In every thing that grows! I pine to learn By patient study of the morns and noons, By deep seclusion of the eves and nights, By constant intercourse with thee and thine, The mysteries of life! O trembling stars That in the frostful winter nights infuse Visions of beauty to the yearning soul! Let me, with reverent eyes and bended knee, Enter the outer porch, and catch a gleam Of your occult, unspoken secrecies! Life throbs eternally through all your spheres, And one pulsation of the immensity, One tidal flow of the incessant wave Of such deep Ocean, would extend my span From seventy to seven times seventy years, And seven times those! O dread profundity Of knowledge that mine earnest eyes would pierceâ That my immortal soul imprisoned here Would measure in the flesh! is there no hope That I can drop my plummet to your depths? That I can shoot my arrow to your heights? That I can swathe and circumscribe and bound The wisdom that you hide? Extend my days, My strength, my life, my soul, or let me die One of the human, common herd and crowd, As careless and as valueless as they!â Thus Chiron's plaint resounded on the shore, Chiron the CentaurâChiron, King of menâ Chiron, no monstrous birth, half man, half steed, But godlike and Titanicâfirst that tamed The wild unbridled horse, and rode his back Firm fixed as Fate, or strong unchangeable Willâ Misnamed the Centaur by the foolish folk Of dull Boeotia:âthus his mournful words Commingled with the anthems of the winds, Quivering amid the hoarse responsive boughs Of perishing oaks, a thousand summers old;â Thus rose it 'mid the psalm of waterfalls, With fitful music, sadder than their own, And still the cry was âLife! oh give me Life! If trees may live for countless centuries, Why shall not I? If Ocean's voice to-day Sounds as it sounded at the birth of Time, Why shall my voice be hushed, mine utterance quenched To-morrow in the tomb?â His prayer was heard: The sunshine and the sun-impregnate Air Shed life into his pores and arteries; The Sea gave healing for the wounds of Time; The Earth distilled its balsams for all ill That flesh can suffer from the darts of Death, And every tree, and herb, and bulb, and flower Bared to his earnest eyes its inmost heart, And said, âO Man of transitory years, Rejuvenescence, Health and Beauty, dwell In every outburst of the teeming springâ In every flower that God permits to grow, In every tender leaflet of the field; In every dew-drop on the rose's cupâ And all are thine.â He sawâhe plucked! He drank and ate, and felt in all his limbs Immortal Strength and Youth! Time passed him by And left no wrinkle on his check or brow, No dimness in his eye, and in his step No faltering such as curbs the sons of men, And teaches them how humble they should be In presence of the swift approaching doom That blows them from the Earth, like leaf from branch. The world was his, and all its privilege To love, to do, to suffer, and to know; And loving, doing, knowing, suffering much, To rise to godlike heights, and be of gods Equal and peer. Alas! alas for him! He had not bargained for his youth of heart; And that grew old. He had not thought to crave For sweet renewal of his sympathies, For lighting of Imagination's fire, For flowering of Affection, ever fresh As Earth's young daisies when the Springtime leaps Jocund from Southern skies to Northern meads! Alas for him, that would be overwise! He had the body of Youth, but not the soul; And all his knowledge, plucked from Heaven's own gate, Served but to show him how his utmost range Was but the long-day crawling of a snail Over the lowest step of countless steps, That lead to the Eternal vestibule Of God's great Templeâdreamed of by the sage In fitful visions of disordered sleep, But never seen by dwellers on the Earth. âO fool!â;he said; âO worse than mortal fool! To drag the chain of flesh, and link thyself To such incumbrance and imprisonment, When at the end of short appointed Time I might have known the freedom of the spheres, And been the real god whose part I play With piteous masquerade; and humbly sat At God's own footstool; knowing what I knew By God's permission and God's recompense! âFather Supreme! I supplicate for Death! Death is Thy law;âno evil to the just, No sorrow to the wise. I never prayed So ardently and clamorously for Life As now I pray for Death! Oh, let me die, And sink into the quiet common grave With mine earth-vestureâas the rain-drop sinks Into the grateful bosom of the field. My soul shall live again the life ordained In the Soul's Universe; not prisoned hereâ A wing-clipped eagleâa dark-grubbing moleâ A limpet on the rockâa barren stone Weltering unheeded on the shore of Time.â Long, long he suffered ere his prayer was heard: Great was his crime, great was his punishment. DYNAMENE. Sitting alone and sad beside the Sea, I had a vision of Dynamene: Dynamene and all her sisters fair Grouped on the rocks and sand and sea-beach bare, The fifty daughters of the Foam Upfloating, on calm billows borne To the warm fringes of their Ocean home; More beautiful than burst of ruddy morn, More tender than the flush of Summer eves, Defter and nimbler than the light that weaves Its fairy net-work on the wave, When Phoebus from his cold nocturnal cave Starts on the grateful world, until it leap Jocund and rubicund from sleep. Careless and happy were they each and all Save one, dark-eyed, who held my heart in thrall, And sat apart, self-banished from the restâ Dynamene, as lonely and as bright As Hesper glowing in the empurpled West, Absorbing all the splendours of the Night. âTell me,â;I said, âwhat is it that they do, These fair ones seven times seven, Here in the light of Heaven, Betwixt the upper and the nether blue?â Softly she answered: âOn the stormy gale They poise or float, and track the distant sail; Or dive, or swim, or gather gems and pearls To deck their blue-veined arms and flaxen curls. And when the sailor, far adrift, Remorseful wanderer, looks forth in vain Over the pathless sea and starless lift, And prays to Heaven to waft him o'er the main To his expectant loved ones back again, They draw aside the curtain of the clouds, Till, peeping wistfully athwart the shrouds, He sees in Heaven's blue deep the Polar Star, And hails the guiding light so fair and far, And steers his certain bark toward the shore, And vows, unwitting perjuror! to sail the seas no more. âThey tend beneath the rocking, rolling waves, The white bare bones that Earth refuses graves; And strew the barren ribs with pearls and gems, Or crown the dead skulls with such diadems As amorous monarchs, kneeling to their brides, Would fail to purchase with a nation's gold. And far beneath the cradle of the tides, Where rot and fall away since days of old The argosies of great forgotten kings, They meditate on Chance and Time and Change, Till, weary of the Pastârings linked in rings, In one eternal samenessâthey would range To newer life, and then they come as now To take such pleasure as the hours allow Upon the melancholy beach, And foot it merrily, each with each, To the Sea Music men have never heard, And never may; but sounding loud and clear To spiritual sense, that knows nor eye, nor earâ Lighter than song of morn or evening birdâ Deeper than organ peal, pervading Heaven When thunder-volleys clash, and lightning-clouds are riven.â âAnd thou,â;I said, âwho sharest not their mirth, Fairer than restless Sea or steadfast Earth, Why art thou sad, while they rejoice and sing, And have no sorrow?â;âWeary task is mine,â Replied the immortal: âSummer follows Spring, Day Night, Night Day, in changeless round benign, Great to the sons of men, but small and short To us who see beyond it, through far years Ere man was born, and History's poor report Died on the idle interlunar spheres, For want of tongues to tell. 'Tis mine to range O'er mightier cycles; mine to interchange Earth with the Ocean, Ocean with the Land, In channels scooped by an Almighty Hand; Mine from th' incumbent Deeps to disentomb The torpid Continents and Isles, Once more to bask them in the Summer's smiles, And start to teeming life and beauty's bloom. âNot ever lift the perishable hills Their cloven summits to the moon; Not ever run the mountain rills The selfsame course, or sing the same glad tune; Not ever sleeps the unprolifie pole In chains of adamantine ice; Not ever through their groves of spice And tangled woods the tropic rivers roll; For Fate is just, and every rood of Earth, In all her amplitude of girth, Hath its appointed time beneath the Sun, And passes north ward as the Eons run. âIf thou couldst see a thousand fathoms down Upon the tideless pillow of the Deep, As I can see, and know mine ancient lore, Thou wouldst behold, 'mid rock and shingle brown, The shapeless wreck of temple, tower, and town; The dust of palaces and fanes, Of cities of the hills and plains. The bones of Empires, sleeping their last sleep, Their names as dead as if they never bore Name or dominion:âin whose ruins lie The lost arcana of humanity, The perished arts, the sciences forgot, That flourished in the still-recurring Past As hopefully as now, and rot, and rot, And die, and die, until the Future cast Their ghosts into the dreams of Sages, Who re-discover them in after ages. âNot ever trod men's feet the soil of Romeâ Long ere its name was breathed of mortal lips, The sea washed over it in stormy foam; And where the Atlantic whirls the laden ships Great rivers ran, and gorgeous cities stood Upon the margin of the flood, And men made haste to sin and gather gold With pains and sorrows manifold, And pour it at the feet of King and Lord, That led them captive, and would be adored With mighty tribute, if adored at all, And kept their hands at work, their necks in thrall. And where to-day the fishes spawn, Ten times ten thousand years ago Contending hosts for battle drawn Made crimson with their blood the winter snow, And were as mad in their appointed hour, As fools of yesterday that rage and bleed, And slay their fellow-fools, for greed Of wicked and insatiable power. âAll changes. Earth and Sea Permute eternally. 'Tis mine to follow my maternal wave, Although it lead me o'er an Empire's grave. And 'tis my privilege to sigh, As much as thine, O man of thoughtful heart! Who, when the Winter creeps upon the sky, Grievest for Summer blossoms that depart! My flowers are Empires! Lo! they pass away, And lo! new Empires bloom in God's eternal Day!â SISYPHUS. Ever and evermore Upon the steep life-shore Of Death's dark main, Bare to the bitter skies, His mournful task he plies In vain, in vain! Sometimes he looks to Heaven And asks to be forgiven The grievous pain. The stars look sadly down, The cold sun seems to frownâ In vain, in vain! But kindly mother Earth, Remembering his birth, Doth not disdain To sympathise with him, So worn of heart and limb; In vain, in vain! Is not his fate her own? The rolling toilsome stone Rolled back again? Are not her children's woes The very same he knows?â In vain, in vain! Do not all Earth and Sea Repeat eternally Th' unvarying strain? The old and sad lament With human voices blent, In vain, in vain! Through the green forest arch The wild winds in their march Sigh and complain; The torrent on the hill Moans to the midnight chill, In vain, in vain! The hoarse monotonous waves Attune from all their caves, Thro' storm and rain, The melancholy cry, To listening Earth and sky, In vain, in vain! Love mourns its early dead; Hope its illusions fled, Or rudely slain; And Wealth and Power prolong The same, th' eternal song, In vain, in vain! Toil, Sisyphus, toil on! Thou'rt many, though but one! Toil heart and brain! Oneâbut the type of all Rolling the dreadful ball, In vain! in vain! MOMUS. Momus, the youngest son of Erebus, Brother of Night and Day, the friend of Man, Knelt lowly at Apollo's feet to crave Protection from the gods, that loved him once But now pursued him with revengeful hate. Apollo heard, and with a gracious hand Upraised him from the ground, as king might king. âWhat hast thou done,â;he said, âthat thus the gods Clamour against thee with incessant tongue, And bear their plaints to the Eternal Throne? Tell me thy fault, or if not faultâoffence, That I may stand betwixt their wrath and thee.â As the dark sea reflects the morning light, In myriad smiles upon its every wave, So the sad face of Momus flushed with joy As he replied: âI've told the gods the truth, And shown them what they are, nor more nor less; Truth without malice, truth with jesting tongue, Truth without gall, for merriment in heaven. And if I laugh, and feel no bitterness, Am I not Lord of Laughter, even as Thou Art Lord of Light? Fate cleaves my way, like thine, And I must laugh as Ares must destroy, And Aphrodite love, and Hera frown, And Dionysus quaff the juice of grape. Why should the gods forget themselves like men, And for an arrowy word that draws no blood, And makes no puncture in immortal flesh, Implore the lightnings on my careless head, And strive to hurl me hopeless out of Heaven?â Apollo led him to the assembled gods, Defiant, half rejoicing, half afraid, And would have soothed their anger by fair words, But that the storm of passion, breaking loose, O'erflowed its bounds among the goddesses, Who would have slain him, had their hate the power, But that they knew his immortality Coeval with their own. All spake at once, For all imagined or invented wrong; And each had fed the other's misery By loose report and spiteful surplusage, Till Aphrodite, red and white by turns, As flowed or ebbed the billows of her rage, Shook from her passionate eyes the lightning flash, And from her beauteous lips the venomous words, That proved she had been scorned; and stepping forth In the full lustre of her loveliness, Like Cynthia seen through storm of driving rain, Spake for the rest, with short sharp utterance. âHe hath a slanderous and malignant tongue! His looks are poison! He defames the gods, Blasphemes, and lies, and makes a hell of Heaven!â Said Momus, âDid I e'er blaspheme thy name? Said I thou wert not fair? If so, I lied, And will do penance. If I said, woe's me! That thou wert chaste, why then I lied again, And court the doom decreed, whate'er it be!â âWhy sleep the thunderbolts? Is Justice dead? Thou, Ares, if thou love me, smite him dumb!â Said Aphrodite, all her lovely frame Convulsed and quivering. Pallas touched her handâ Pallas, serene and never to be moved By words of passion from the calm of soul, In which her wisdom centred like a star In the blue depths of an unfathomed skyâ And said: âBe still, ye over-angry tongues, While I unfold his jibes and mockeries Against the awful sanctities of Heavenâ Against the Truth itself. He said of me That I was cold, pedantic, hard of heart, That all my wisdom was not worth a song Sung by a Bacchanal on festal night. He said of Aphrodite, queen of queens, The loveliest birth and master-piece of Time, That he forgave the number of her loves, Many as billows on the rolling sea, But that she had a footfall ponderous As that of ox which treadeth out the corn! He said of Ares, in his pomp of arms, That he was brutal, cruel, lapping blood As dogs lap water; that he filled the earth With murder, rapine, ruin, and revenge, And drove the nations frantic with the blast Of his war-trumpet, flaring blood and death. He said of great Diana, huntress born, That fond Endymion woo'd her smile in vain, And languished hopeless; not because 'twas sin To stoop from Heaven to share a mortal's love, But for the reason, paramount as Fate, That love required a heart, and she had none. He said of Dionysus that his wine Maddened the brain and gladdened not the soul; That as Silenus was, would Bacchus beâ The slave of lust and carnal appetite! He said of Hermes, that he was a spy More than a messenger; and that the god, The foolish goddess, or the credulous nymph, Who trusted him with secrets, made them known To all the babbling company of Heaven.â Apollo smiled. âAnd is this all,â;he said, âThat makes ye rage like children of the Earth, Silly and frivolous, at speech so vain?â âNot so,â;replied the goddess, looking round Triumphant on the crowd; âHe speaks of Thee! He owns thou art the Lord of Life and Light, God of the gods, whose glory shines supreme, Absorbing ours as Day absorbs the Night: But oft proclaims, with jesting words profane, That all thine odes and idyls, songs and hymns, Made on the earth to please the sons of men, When dwelling on the slopes of Arcady And tending sheep, were execrable verse, Too bad for gods or men!â âAnd is this so?â Apollo asked, his keen eyes flashing fire. And then, relapsing suddenly to calm, That dwelt but on his face, he turned aside And spake to Momus. âGet thee gone to Earth! Thy wit offends the gods! Thy words are lies! I have been banished and have herded sheep, And gone through drudgeries, and suffered wrong: Do thou the same. Mankind has need of thee. Show them their faults; jest, laugh, and speak the truth, And make them better with thy pleasantriesâ The gods require thee not!â So Momus fell Unpitied to the Earth. The Earth was glad To see his sock, his buskin, and his mask, And gave him welcome. Here he still abides, And sports and laughs, beloved of kings and crowdsâ Their guide, their teacher, comforter and friend. IPHIANASSA IN DODONA. Away! freed soul, away! And to the body linked By fine invisible chord Stretching from Earth to Heaven, Mount through the circling air Up to the starry roof Where stands the Eternal Throne! Away! freed soul, away! The world is but a grief, Impediment, and pain! Shake off the heavy load, And rustle from thy wing Earth and its vanities, Time and its balances, Space and its nothingness, And soar! soar! soar! Up to the azure floor, There to chant prophetic anthems, free for evermore. Behold! the Earth-born sleeps, The Heaven-born seeks its source; The mortal eyes are dim, Th' immortal sight grows clear; The human tongue, that spoke Of nought but human cares, And little foolish joys, And vanities inane, Receives the gift divine, To speak the speech of God. Hush, rustling robe! hush, breath! Hear what the Spirit saith: The mysteries, and prophecies, the things of Life and Death. IPHIANASSA. âBehold, a vision of the days to be, Curtained in agony and gloom and terror; The clash of Truth with ever desperate Errorâ Error, a wide, unknown, and stormy sea; And Truth, a little white-sailed bark, Gleaming and glancing in the dark, The wild winds raging o'er it, The deep depths yawning under, Defiant of the waves to drown, Or rocks to rend asunder. âBehold, a vision of the days to be!â The angry shock of javelin and sword, The groan of Death, the shout of Victory, And red rills purling o'er the trampled sward; And then a low, long, melancholy sound, As of commotion under ground, Approaching nearer, ever nearer, Till all the cities of the plain Quake in their temples, towers, and palaces, And fall to Earth in stony rain, And Empire leaves them, leaves them, leaves them, Never to return again. âBehold, a vision of the days to be! Behold the God, the woman's Child, So patient and so undefiled, Led bleeding from the judgment-seat, And nailed upon the shameful tree! Blush, outraged Heaven! weep, Earth! for at His feet The kingdoms of the world must fall; And He, and every Truth he taught, Shall ruleâthe Lords of Life and Thoughtâ Triumphant over all! âBehold, a vision of the days to be!â Cruel and eager of dominion, The mighty Eagle lies with bleeding pinion, And shrieks in the death-agony, That no one pitiesâand that no one canâ Not Fate herself, nor god, nor man. Behold the ravens gathering ere he dies, Pitiless war to pitiless foe delivering, To dig their beaks into his closing eyes, And rend his heart, to share it out, still quivering. âBehold, a vision of the days to be!â A pilgrim preaching in the market-place, Moving men's hearts as tempests move the sea, And with the madness of his eloquent face Making them mad.âI hear their frantic shout, With terrible words unknown.âI see the rout, Mail-clad and armed with spear and lance, Burst like as a pent-up torrent, and advance To guard a Sepulchre and Holy Hill, Surging and roaring o'er the Eastern landsâ Murder and rapine in their handsâ Bearing a book to save, a sword to kill. âBehold, a vision of the days to be!â A lonely ship upon a lonely sea, Sailing forlorn, upon forlornest quest, To seize the secrets of the West, And wrench the bolted doors of worlds unknownâ The due completion of the Zone. He, chief of men, who leads the mutinous hostâ Forlorn, and most forlornâ Laments the hour that he was born, And strains his eyes towards the unseen coast. Go, find it, mariner! nor furl thy sail Till the spice odours of the land come laden on the gale. âMy wearied eyes grow dim: I cannot see, Amid the gathering gloom of days to be, Aught save the lightning flashing o'er dark skies; But I can hear faint shrieks and piteous cries, And loud tumultuous roar, Rolling and surging evermore. And 'mid the fitful pauses of the storm I hear a voiceâI see a formâ The form of one who bears a book, The voice of one who whispers, âLook! Here is the path of Truth and Right; Here is the Law of Life and Light!â The whispered words sound ever faint and lowâ But Truth shall reign. Woe to the nations, woe!â THE PRAYER OF THE PRIEST OF ISIS. âAll that hath been, is, or ever shall be. No mortal hath ever lifted my veil.ââ Inscription over the Temple of Isis. Merciful Mother Isis! take me back into thy bosom! Take me back! oh take me back! I have wandered from thee long; I have strayed in doubt and sorrow through a wilderness of darkness, Ever searching for the right, but for ever going wrong. Take me back! oh take me back! repentant and heart-humbled, To the high embattled fortress of thy love that may not fail, For I'm weary, very weary, and I long to rest my spirit In the shadow of the glory of thy never-lifted veil. âAll that hath been; all that is; or ever shall be.â The words conveyed no meaning to a soul so rash as mine, That would pierce to the forbidden and soar to the Eternal, And ravish all the treasures that are locked within the shrine. I have erred; and I have suffered! Take me back, O gracious Isis! Me humbled, me remorseful, me conscious of my sin, To slumber free of heart in the gardens of thy Temple, But never more to tempt the blinding Light within. I longed, I pined for knowledge, as the Desert pines for moisture: It came, but only brought me a harvest of despair, To find I was a captive in the dungeons of the Senses, And could not pierce beyond them to the fresh, rejoicing air. I saw the skies above meâwith all their cloud and gloryâ Long, long my spirit fretted at the thraldom and the pain; Like the sad imprisoned eagle, that beholds the purple mountain, But may not hope to reach it for the torture of the chain. Mankindâtheir joys and sorrows, their dreams and aspirationsâ Grew little in my sight as the grasses of the lea, Little as the rain-drops that plash into the river, Little as the pebble in the deep Eternal Sea! I thought I was immortal, and when I strove to prove it, I found all reason useless to show that Life or Death Was aught but change of fashion, or that my soul was other Than a rustling 'mid the branches, or a drawing of the breath;â To show that Life immortal, to human pride so precious, Was not alike the essence of all that live and move, And all that live and move not:âof the bluebell in the meadow, Of the flame that is extinguished, of the green leaf in the grove, Of the dog that licks my hand and is happy in my presence, Of the earth on which I tread, of the waves that rush and roll, Or that matter, spirit, light, are not alike eternal, The vesture of the Almighty! the body of the soul! My heartâmy brainâmy spirit grew weary of inquiry, And words deprived of value prefigured things no more: Evil and Good were fused: there was nor Great nor Little, Nor any Up nor Down, nor Future nor Before, Nor any Past or Presentânor Anything but Nothingâ One calm eternal circle, in which the shard-born fly, That sports amid the sunshine from dawning to the twilight, Was quite as good and lovely and God-esteemed as I. If I had plan and passionâso had the bee and beaver; If I lived out my lifeâso lived the midge its term; If I could see before me as far as sense could lead meâ So also could the maggot, the emmet, and the worm. If these were held in bondage, and could not over-pass itâ What better or what nobler, except in my degree, Was I, a little insect upon the Earth's great forehead, That wandered in the furrows, and thought that it was free? And now, all gracious Isis! lest madness overtake me, Receive me back a truant, repentant that he strayed; Who learned in sin and sorrow that Knowledge, at its noblest, Is Ignorance extendedâthe gleaming of a shade. Take me back! oh take me back!âundeceivedâwith childish wisdom; And in the Peace of Faith let me sink into my rest, As happy at thy footstool, adoring and confiding, As a ripple in the sunshine, or an infant at the breast. IARCHUS AND HIS RINGS. The clamorous people throng about my porch To purchase rings, which they believe I weld In holy fire, and steep in essences, And permeate with virtuous healing powers Known but to gods in Heaven, and me on Earth. I cannot cure them of their ignorance, But twine it into Knowledge of mine own For their behoof.âI smile, and give them rings And good advice. Th' advice restores the sick If duly followed; but the rings alone Receive the praises of the multitude, That loves to be deceived, adores a lie, Doats on the incredible, and scorns the truth. But you, my sons, know better. Lo! the rings, The five gold rings, that worn with trusting faith, Preserve the freshness and the flower of Youth Better than balsam or medicament That Chiron ever plucked, or Hermes knew! Three for the left hand for the body's health, Two for the right, for healing of the soul;â Learn ye their attributes and faculties, And teach them to the crowd; so shall ye be, As I have been, the ministers of Hope, The kind physicians, the unfailing friends, Of wayworn men who've missed the road to health And withered ere their time, like smutted corn. Who wears the first, must keep his body pure, From toe to crown, by daily dalliance With cleansing waters, Heaven's most precious gift, A duty and a luxury both in one. Who wears the second must avoid excess In every appetite: in food and drink, In passion, in desire, in toil, in sleep. Who wears the third must train himself to use All faculties the bounteous gods bestow: Must teach his eyes to see, his ears to hear, His hands to toil, his feet to run and leap, His lungs to breathe the invigorating air; Must train his head to think, his heart to feel, And exercise each power of life and limb To full efficiency, nor overstretch Even by a hair the tension of the string, Lest it should jar and snap. Who wears the three Shall be a perfect man, except in soul: A physical nobleâsafe from all but Time, And accident, and chastening of the gods. But for the mental health and purity These not suffice. The right hand rings must aid The perfect work, and crown the King of men. Who wears the first must love all human kind, And feed his spirit with all charities And chaste affections; must be faithful friend And joyous comrade; must be loving sire And tender husband; must with filial care Cherish the old, the suffering, and the poor; And so comport himself, that men shall say, In evil times when griefs oppress the state, This is the model of a citizen, Whose hand shall aid or guide the Commonwealth; Whose patriotic heart and fruitful brain Shall goad to action and inspire success. Who wears the second must with humble heart And fervent faith commend himself to Godâ God of all gods, Creator of the world, Who gave the Universe its shape and law, And makes obedience its own recompense, Crime its own penalty, and needs no praise Of idle words, being most glorified By Labour, and submission to His laws, The melodies and harmonies of Time, And choral anthem of Eternity. Who wears these earthly, yet most heavenly rings, Pure without taint or dross, and duly serves The invisible spirits that within them dwell, Need no physician more. The golden age, Departed from the world, revives in him, And all the physics and the essences The Earth affords are futile to exalt His good to betterness. And when at last Death lays his finger on that honoured head, He lays it gently, like a tender friend That would console and cheer. Life's heavenly flame, Freed by the touch, mounts cheerily to Heaven, Made one with God, for ever and evermore. THE GARDEN OF NEMESIS. Gather, oh gather all the fruits ye will, Children of Earth who roam my garden fair!â All that the choicest essences distil, All blossoms that enrich the fragrant air, All beauty or delight of bud or leaf, All dainty grapes or apples of desire, Wreaths for your triumph, garlands for your grief, And festive coronals for harp or lyreâ Yours is the garden, use it as you may, Ere all its glories fade and pomp of bloom decay. But use it wisely: every visible fruit Hath one invisible on the self-same boughâ Sorrow's the shadow of Joy; and from one root Spring balm and bale: the avenging gods allow No pleasure without painâno crime or sin Without its destined punishment, twin born; Delight's fresh apple hath an asp within, And Healing points the barb of Misery's thornâ Fate plants the tree, and tends the opening flowerâ Walk warily, mortal men, there's danger in the bower! ADMETUS. Admetus, king of men, uprose at morn, Unrested, unrefreshed, and vigil-worn, And called his councillors and trusted friends, His skilful fashioners of means to ends, To aid him in the darkness of a doubt, And clear a pathway to the light without, And disentangle the perplexing chain Of public peril that oppressed his brain. He talkedâthey talked; â but from their talk upsprang Nor aid, nor cheer, nor aught but wordy clang And windy argument. He smote his head, Despairing of their help. âBegone!â;he said, âAnd I will pour the story of my grief To one whose wisdom shall afford reliefâ A youth whose lightest word or idlest thought Reveals more judgment than the years have brought To greybeards such as you, who never learn A new experience, and refuse to turn Out of the ancient ruts in which you toil To evener paths across untrodden soil.â âWho, and whence comes this wonder of the land?â Said one whose place was at the king's right hand; âThis marvellous boy, whom eye hath never seen, Except the king's, and in whose soul serene Wisdom hath found her throne?â;The king replied, Cheerily, calmly, and forbore to chide, âA shepherd boy, as fair as morning light, Who tends my flocks upon the mountain heightâ My servant and my friend.â;Each looked at each, And said with glancees eloquent as speech, âThe kingis crazed; much care hath driven him wild.â Admetus understood them; but he smiled Contemptuous, and went forth from them alone To the bleak moorland and the mossy stone, Where oft at sunrise sat the shepherd boy, To gaze upon its light, as if 't were joy And duty both in one, to hail and bless Its first faint radiance in the wilderness. Admetus found him, facing the full orb, Drinking the rays as if he would absorb The sunshine, till it pierced through all his frame, And lit his human flesh with heavenly flame. Divine he seemed, but sad; his eye of fire Shot sparkles of unsatisfied desire, As t'ward the sun he turned; but when he saw The king approaching, and the love and awe That mingled in his face, a smile benign Lit him all over. âFriend and master mine, I've thought of thee the long, long summer day, And grieve to quit theeâfor I must awayâ Back to my native home. But tell me now, O king, with care and sorrow on thy brow, And countless councillors to aid thee ever Through all the tangled mazes of cndeavour, Why hast thou sought meâme, a shepherd youth, Poor and unknown, to guide thee to the truth Thy courtiers cannot find?â;Replied the kingâ âBecause I found thee fruitful as the spring In modest wisdom, charity, and love, And all the virtues of the gods above; And more than all, because when I would choose To take unto my heart, and never lose, A friend indeed, he must be man of men, Of lion-heart, dove-eye, and eagle-kenâ A man, whatever be his rank or birth, By Heaven predoomed to sanctify the earth. Such have I found thee, herding on the hill My sheep and beeves; and such I find thee still, Nobler in poverty and mean estate Than all the kings who enter at my gate.â âTrue friend of Man, and searcher of the heart,â Replied the shepherd boy, âthough I departâ My penance doneâand seek my heavenly bowers, Know, thou hast harboured in his evil hours, A banished god. Admetus! close thine eyes, Lest thou behold, this day, without disguise, Apollo in his glory, and be slain By the too fatal splendour, veiled in vain, To save from doom, pronounced since Time began, The too presumptuous and unhappy man Who'd gaze upon the gods!â;Admetus knew That a god spake; and kneeling in the dew, Covered his reverent face; while from afar A voice came floating from the morning star, Which said, in words that seemed to wave and roll In seas of music through his listening soulâ âAdmetus! king of men! when evil days Afflict thy spirit, turn thy hopeful gaze To judging Heaven, and know that thou shalt find Friends in the gods, for friendship to mankind!â THE DREAM OF ANACREON. Last night my dreams took fearful shape: I dreamed that Earth had lost the grape, And that the only cup of wine Left in the wretched world was mine. I raised it to my thirsty mouth, Flushed with desire and parched with drouth, To fire and animate my soul, When lo! the false malicious bowl Crashed in my hand that tightly bound, And shed the treasure on the ground. âAh, well!â;I sighed, âif such it be, I am resigned to Fate's decree.â The wild winds blow, The rain-drops flow, Heaven's noblest gifts are with us still, And plenty skips on plain and hill; I'll cease to mourn the perished vine, And Water shall be good as wine! My second dream was darker farâ The world had lost its guiding star, Its glory and delight were gone, Immortal Love had heavenward flown; I knew no more its cheerful bliss, For 't was impossible to kiss, Though youthful lips might strive to meet In fond commingling, pure and sweet: Some force, result of demon art, Kept them eternally apart. âAh me!â;I cried, â't is time to die, No joy is left beneath the sky!â I slumbering spokeâ I groaned and wokeâ And found my PhrynÃ© at my sideâ Mine own, my beautiful, my bride; And to repay me for my pain, I kissed her thrice, and thrice again! And when the moving light up-sprent, And forth into the world I went, And heard the silly crowd complain Of grief, and penury, and pain; Or rich men groan at fancied ill, The mere diseases of the will; Or poor men sigh, whose limbs were strong, At petty care or transient wrong; Or dull philosophers declare That human life was hard to bearâ Oh fools! I cried, look forth, and see What bounteous gifts the gods decree! While beams the sun, Or rivers run, The water and the wine shall flow; For health and strength, and balm of woe, And Love, eternal as the spheres, Shine through the rain of human tears! PHIDIAS. Am I so old, so feeble, and so faded, That my right hand hath lost for evermore The cunning of its prime? Is my light shaded, And all the fruitful fancies that it bore? My mind was once an orchard, ripe and sunny, A forest opulent with flower and tree, Where idlest bees might gather store of honey; And hath my winter come? Ah, woe is me! I will go back again into my summer, Into the spring-time and the mid-noon blaze, And sit among my foliage, a fresh-comer, To study what I did in ancient days. In my past strength I'll bathe me as in oceanâ With mine own beauties fire my fading sight, And kindle yet again mine old emotion In my own labours, and my youth's delight. Lo! here the young Apollo! lithe and lustrous In the immortal beauty of my thought! His lips apart with joy, his rich hair clustrous Over his godlike brow! his right hand fraught With power and majesty; a visible glory Veiling him over, as a mist the sun New risen o'er the mountain summits hoary To wake the world! And this mine hands have done! Lo! Pallas! with her face of calm, sweet sorrowâ A sorrow of divinest wisdom bornâ Looks upwards to the stars, as if to borrow Comfort from them, to cast on men forlorn. And I, too, fashioned her: my brain conceived her! Ah, no! I must have seen her, must have known That she came unto me, and I received her, And carved from life the vision of the stone. And lo! beside her, beautiful and tender, White as the ocean-foam from which she sprang, Great Aphrodite! in her nude, pure splendour, At whose glad birth the expectant planets rang. Lovely! most lovely! fondled by the Graces, Even in the marble where she stands, and showers From her lips kisses, from her arms embraces, And from her eyes looks that unfold the flowers. Ye shall suffice me, O ye fair creations Of mine exulting prime! Though dim mine eyesâ Though I be quite forgotten of the nationsâ Here I am young for ever, and arise Amid my youthful fancies, time-defiant! The old fire burns within me as of yore; I stand upon the Past, and, self-reliant, Know that my name shall live for evermore. CASSANDRA. We live in a time of sorrow, A time of sorrow and change, When the Old goeth down to destruction, And the New cometh sadly to life, Unshapely, unwelcome, uncared for: When Fact is at war with Idea, And Thought hath no rest for her pinions, No ground for her wandering feet. A time, a time for tears to flow, Like streams when the wild rain-tempests blow. Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! We live in a time of sorrow, When Faith hath gone out from the earth, And old Superstitions are dying: When Opinion hath nothing to stand on But stubble of dry mathematics, And marrowless graveyards of logic: When the few who can think look around them, And sigh that all thinking is vain. A time, a time for cheeks to glow At the shame and the wrong of this world below. Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! We live in a time of sorrow, When the ship that bears our lives Hath neither crew nor pilot, And drives through the merciless billows, The cloud and the lightning above it, The rocks and the whirlpools under; When the men and the women and children, Sit wringing their hands, imploring The gods who alone can save. A time, a time when the world shall know How deep the roots of its misery grow. Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! We live in a time of sorrow, When men have no thought but of money, And carnal delights it will bring them, Of mansions and horses and statues, And power to out-glitter their neighbours; When women are slaves to their raiment, And prattle all day about nothings: Unless they do worse, and out-babble The preachers of bloodshed and hatred. A time, a time when the high and low Shall share in the pitiless overthrow. Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! We live in a time of sorrow, When Mockery crushes Reason, And heartless laughter settles All doubts that the wise man feels. When Reverence hath departed And Worship is dead and buried; Or sleeps, if it live at all, In the souls of little children. A time, a time when the ebb and flow Murmur alike that the whirlwinds blow. Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! We live in a time of sorrow, When statesmen and chiefs and rulers Have nothing to build on but quicksands, And nothing to do but to cobble The ricketty, crazy thrones That can scarcely bear their burdens. And when priests at their mouldering altars, No longer have faith in the doctrine They preach for the lucre it brings them; And scarcely conceal from the people The fact that they prophesy falsely. A time, a time for blood to flow, And the earth to stagger to and fro, Woe to the nations! woe to them! woe! ENCELADUS. O vengeful, cruel, and remorseless gods, That would have smitten me to nothingness Had you the power, I bless your impotence! You cannot curb my free immortal thought That curses and defies you evermore;â You may not, and you cannot, slay my soul! Crush me with tortures mighty as yourselves; Mountain on mountain pile upon my breast; Afflict me, in omnipotence of rage, Until my flesh creep, and my marrowy bones Are desiccate with fire, and my huge pain Goads me to struggles that appal the world, And shake to dust the towns and villages At Etna's baseâlo! I defy you still! You cannot even drive me to despair! The Earth is doomed to perish. Etna's bulk Shall melt away as if it were a dream. But I, Enceladus, shall still survive, Immortal as yourselves! Great though ye be, The God of gods is mightier than youâ And when your hour has passed, my hour shall come. ORPHEUS IN THRACE. How shall I sing in Thrace? Be hushed, my lute! Amid the mockeries of this grovelling people There is no reverence for song the immortal. How shall they bear to hear of glorious deeds, Who have no passion save for gathering riches, The slaves of appetite all gross and carnal? How shall the tender music of my chant, Born of the touch of all divine emotions, Throb through the pulses of a swine-like rabbleâ That feels not sympathyâthat knows not Loveâ That gibes at Truthâthat jeers and laughs at Pity, And undervalues all the gods hold sacred? What though the forest trees and ancient hills, The flow'rets at my feet, and Ocean's billows, Respond for ever to my heavenly music;â If men reply not, useless is my song; My voice is as the voice of one in deserts, And makes no ripple on the stagnant air. And men are deserts if they have no heartsâ Deserts and worse; for deserts breed no evils Worse than themselves! Hush evermore, O music! Be silent, O thou once entrancing song, That shaped the people's fancies to thy pleasure, And swayed their callous minds to noble effort! Be silent, silent, silent evermore! It is not music that such people merit, But rods to scourge, and thunderbolts to blast them!â Not music and sweet song, and words divine, But fire from heaven to wither and consume them, For mockery of the gods and scorn of virtue! I will go forth alone unto the sea, And hold communion with the moaning waters, And melancholy winds, and chafing foreland! I will go forth alone, and sad of heart, And talk with gods, not men; with fauns and satyrs; With wandering winds and echoes of the valleys; With shadows of the rocks; with night and morn; With savage beasts; with birds upon the branches; With all that God has made, save man the scorner!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SKETCHES FROM NATURE. HEART-SORE IN BABYLON. No. I.âSELF-ASSERTION. Why should I tell the world my sorrow? Why should I open my heart to themâ To fools and knaves, to tyrants and slaves, Who'd prate, and giggle, and condemn? My sorrow 's mine, and I will treasure it, Silent and secret, and all alone; None but myself shall dare to measure it, Or ask me wherefore I weep or moan. And yet my sorrow shall find expression, For eyes it hath, deep, deep, and clear, That can see far hidden the things forbidden, Things that are, though they never appear. A voice it hath, once soft and woman-like, Now fitful, turbulent, and strong, Yet musical, God knows, and human-like, And falling, failing, dying in song. And we shall speakâI and my sorrowâ All that we think, all that we know, All that we see in this Babel burrow, Where the little emmets come and go. We shall be in them, yet not among themâ We shall be merry, or we shall sigh; And the crowd shall laugh at some gibe we've flung them, Nor dream of our hidden agony. The soldier, fighting his country's battles, With bosom bare to a hundred guns, Tells not to all that he 's a coward When he thinks of his home and his little ones. The clown in the ring, who grins and tumbles Till the joyous crowd all shout and start, May be sick and fainting beneath his painting, And wring his jests from a tortured heart. And if I choose to don the motleyâ Motley shall be the garb I'll wear; And if to-morrow I go in sackcloth, It may be velvet to my despair. If I consent to dwell with beggars, Or sit with forlornest courtesan, With pedlars talk, with vagabonds walk, I have a method, and know my plan. If I drink with thieves, I can dine with nobles; At twelve o' th' clock to my lady's ball; And at three, if so it please my fancy, To the cold highway and the nook i' the wall. On Sunday to church, or high cathedral, Or the chilly chapelâfor all are mine; Or a tramp far out to the field and forest, Where the winds make music more divine. And all shall minister to my sorrow, Perhaps to my scorn and my disdain; Perhaps to the soothing of my spirit, And the ease of a hot and bitter pain. No more of self! though perhaps âmy ladyâ May ask if Love were all to blame; And âmy lord,â;good man! may think 'tis money, Or nipped ambitionâor blighted fame. And am I youthful, or stony old? Older than yesterday! Young as to-day! With brown locks streaming over a forehead That has throbbed enough to turn them gray; And a dream in my spirit for ever and everâ A dream of a glory passed away. No. II.âTHE RIGHT TO DISDAIN. How shall I gain The right to disdain? The right to look down With a saint-like frown Upon sorrow and sin? How shall I win The right to scorn My brother forlorn, Or pass him by With reproving eye, As much as to say, âGet out of the way, And taint me not With the poison spot That comes from thy heart, thy face, thy brow, To me, much holier than thou?â Were I far more bright Than the heavenly light, More pure than the snow Where the glaciers grow, And as undefiled as a little child Dead and forgiven And gone to heaven, I should not gain The right to disdain, Or to stand apart From my brother's heart, Or turn my face From a sinner's place, Or breathe one word of hate or scorn To the meanest wretch that ever was born. No. III.âA PRAYER FOR REST. Oh, I long to be at rest From the struggle and the quest, From the knavery and lies, That beset me in disguise; From the fever and the moil, And the still recurring toil; From the sorrow and regret, From the agony and fret, From the thirst and hunger pain, That I feel, though I disdain; From the mean and petty cares Ever springing unawares, To degrade me and enslave, When my spirit is most brave. Oh, I long to lay me down In the green earth's bosom brown; And to let the daisies grow Fresh above me and my woe; For I sicken at the guilt Of the blood that 's daily spilt. I am hopeless of my kind, So degraded and so blind; I am hopeless of the good That's so little understood; And I'm hopeless of the best, And its nugatory quest; Oh, I'm weary, very weary, And I long to be at rest! No. IV.âLOSSES. I lost a friend, but was consoled; The world had other friends for me; His friendship had a base of gold; And when that vanished, so did he. I lost a love; and though I sighed To know myself most desolate, I asked a question of my pride, And with the answer conquered Fate. No. V.âNEVER ALONE. Alone? alone? I'm never alone! Ten thousand spirits walk with me, Over the street and its flinty stone, Over the sands of the rolling sea, Through the quiet woodland, blithe with birds, And the purple moor where the plover cries; Through meadows speck'd with flocks and herds, By lakes that mirror the evening skies. High on the mountain's icy crest, And down, down 'mid the dust below, Companions come at my soul's behest, And hover about me where'er I go. 'Tis only in the midst of men, Their hatreds, meannesses, and spites, Their sneering scorn, their jests forlorn, Their base, unmannerly delights, That I feel the weight of Solitude, And pine for the moorlands bleak and wild, For the freshening balms of the pathless wood, Or the prattle of a little child;â I long to fly to the ends of the Earth, Into communion of mine own, Anywhere out of their dreary mirth,â Aloneâaloneâbut never alone! No. VI.âA NAME ON A TREE. I carved my name on a beech-tree boleâ Fool was I! Lithe of limb and merry of soul, That saw no cloud on my life's bright sky, Five-and-twenty years ago, When my heart was pure as the drifted snow, And I gave it away, In the light of day, To a fair young maid, ah! woe is me! Under the leaves of this beechen tree. And the five-and-twenty years have passedâ Sad am I! Love was fated not to last, And the dark clouds gathered upon the sky. And I am old;âmy locks are thin, My life hath nothing more to win; But the foolish name Stands here, the same! While all is changed,âLife, Hope, and Truth! Oh, mocking Tree! oh, wasted Youth! No. VII.âCONSOLATION. Thou'rt down, low down, poor heartâ At bottom of the hill; The prudent friends who knew thee When Fortune seemed to woo thee, Are true to Fortune still. So deeply art thou fallen, Who once didst soar so high, That beggars of thy bounty Look proud, and pass thee by; And former boon companions Whisper thy name and frownâ âThe ways of Heaven are righteous, Soâkick himâhe is down!â And yet though down, poor heart, This consolation's thineâ Thy Conscience still befriends thee, And kindly message sends thee, To bear, and not repine. The sun that lights the ocean, Shines also on the mire; The mole-hill and the mountain Alike receive its fire. The humblest dewy daisy That blossoms on the sod, May point like the pine-tree skyward, And drink the light of God. No. VIII.âTHE LOST JEWEL. Long ago, ah, long ago! I lost a jewel of greater worth Than the loveliest lady of the Earth Could hang on her bosom as white as snow,â Or any Emperor flushed with wine Could place on a maiden's finger fine, And say, âBeloved, be thou mine!â Long ago, ah, long ago! I lost it wandering to and fro,â Fairer and purer, brighter far Than the Morn or Evening Star. Could I make it mine again, To clasp itâhold itâand retain, I'd be greater than the king, Richer than the bloomy spring. And where I lost it well I know;â Skill cannot trace it, Or wealth replace it, Or anything else this world can show,â This jewel so bright, My heart's delight, Lost in another's heart long ago,â My richer than Ind, My peace of mind, Lost for ever! ah, long ago! No. IX.âTHE FAIR SERPENT. I look o'er the midnight pavement, âAnd the pricking of my thumbsâ Tells me, before I see it, That something wicked comes. It winds, it trails, it hisses, It flashes in the light, And gleams with its many colours Through the darkness of the night. A serpent, woman-headed, With loose and floating hair. Beware, O fool! how you touch itâ Beware for your soul! Beware! 'Tis beautiful to look at As it rustles through the street, But its eyes, though bright as sunshine, Have the glow of hell's own heat; And worse than the deadly upas Are the odours of its breath: Its whispered words are poison, Its lightest touch is deathâ Death to the heart's affection, Robberyâblightâdespair. Pass on, O fool! and scorn it, And beware for your soul, beware! Many a noble bosom Has that scaly serpent stung With the darting of its eye-light, And the witchery of its tongue; And to feed it and amuse it, And pamper its greedy maw, Many a goodly heirship Has gone like the ice in thawâ Fortune and wide dominion Have melted into air. Pass on, O fool! nor touch it, And beware for your soul, beware! 'T will dance, and frisk, and gambol As long as you pipe and pay, But as soon as your heart grows weary 'T will turn on you and slay. 'T will murmur soft sweet music, To draw you to its mesh, And coil about you fondly, To feed upon your flesh. Beware of this flaunting Gorgon, With the snakes in her wavy hair! Beware, O fool! how you touch herâ Beware for your soul, beware! No. X.âTHE DIRTY LITTLE SNOB. âThere's nothing right but what I think, There's nothing good but meat and drink, There's nothing to compare with âchink,ââ Said the dirty little snob. âAnd work's the greatest âboreâI know, And learning's dull, and virtue âslow,â So, fast shall be the road I'll go!â Said the dirty little snob: Devoid of sense, An ass intense, And dirty little Snob. âI'd like to know the use of friends, Unless they serve one's pleasant ends; The best is he who gives or lends,â Said the dirty little snob. âYour learned men are heavy âswells,â Your moral youths tremendous âsells,â And slang's the only speech that âtells,ââ Said the dirty little snob: The simpering slave, The brainless knave, And dirty little Snob. âHowever chaste and pure she be, And bright and beautiful to see, No woman can say âNoâto me,â Said the dirty little snob. Is there no husband, son, or sire, To drag this creature through the mire, And kick it till his toe shall tire,â The dirty little snob?â The foul and crass Conceited assâ And odious little Snob? No. XI.âTHE WORN-OUT PEN. Old stump, outworn By toil severe, Frail and forlorn, Why linger here? Thy fight is fought, Thy victory's won, Thy work is wrought, Thy day is done;â New days, old pen, Have brought new men, And thou must rot, Abandoned, useless, and forgot. In earlier time, To mould an age, Thy words sublime, On freedom's page, Made nations start With patriot fire, Or touched the heart To pity's lyre. That time is past, And thou art cast Unheeded down, Trod by the footsteps of the town. Men understand A plough or wheel, A draper's wand, A sail or keel; But pens are things Which high and great And popes and kings Agree to hate; And which the crowd, Earth-born, earth-bowed, Can scarcely know For constant load of toil and woe. But yet, may be, A century hence, Men who can see With keener sense, May chance to dig Thy relics cold; And looking big, May cry âBehold! The pen of Might! That loved the Right!â This thy reward!â Rot! poor old pen! Die! hapless bard! No. XII.âTHE SURE ESTATE. What signify the care and pain That I must yet endure, The loss of Loveâthe Love in vain, The crime of being poor? I've an estate of solid earth, Nor broad nor very deep, Where wild winds blow and daisies grow, And moonlight shadows sleep. 'Tis six feet long and two feet wide, Shut out from sorrow's call. It shall be mine some happy dayâ Enough though it be small. Till trump of doom it shall be mine, And make amends for allâ Lost health, lost heart, lost love, lost hope! More than amends for all. LOUISE ON THE DOOR-STEP. Half-past three in the morning! And no one in the street But me, on the sheltering door-step Resting my weary feet;â Watching the rain-drops patter And dance where the puddles run, As bright in the flaring gas-light As dewdrops in the sun. There's a light upon the pavementâ It shines like a magic glass, And there are faces in it, That look at me, and pass. Facesâah! well remembered In the happy Long-Ago When my garb was white as lilies, And my thoughts as pure as snow. Faces! ah yes! I see themâ One, two, and threeâand fourâ That come on the gust of tempests, And go on the winds that bore. Changeful and evanescent They shine 'mid storm and rain, Till the terror of their beauty Lies deep upon my brain. One of them frowns; I know him,â With his thin long snow-white hair, Cursing his wretched daughter That drove him to despair. And the other, with wakening pity In her large tear-streaming eyes, Seems as she yearned toward me, And whispered âParadise.â They pass,âthey melt in the ripples, And I shut mine eyes, that burn, To escape another vision That follows where'er I turn:â The face of a false deceiver That lives and lies; ah me! Though I see it in the pavement, Mocking my misery! They are gone!âall three!âquite vanished! Let no one call them back! For I've had enough of phantoms, And my heart is on the rack! God help me in my sorrow; But there,âin the wet, cold stone, Smiling in heavenly beauty, I see my lost, mine own! There on the glimmering pavement, With eyes as blue as morn, Floats by, the fair-haired darling Too soon from my bosom torn; She clasps her tiny fingersâ She calls me sweet and mild, And says that my God forgives me, For the sake of my little child. I will go to her grave to-morrow, And pray that I may die; And I hope that my God will take me Ere the days of my youth go by. For I am old in anguish, And long to be at rest, With my little babe beside me, And the daisies on my breast. GREAT-GRANDFATHER. Children, I'm going home, And the way is dark with Sorrow, My hair is thin and gray, And the night comes on my day, But I shall be young to-morrow; Younger than you, O children! In the land without endeavour, Where the blind recover sight, And the Morning hath no Night, And Love endures for ever. These eyes that see but dimly Your long, soft, golden hair, Shall pierce with keener vision Than the falcon's in the air, Through mysteries and wonders That the tongue cannot declare. These senses long obstructed By the weight and wear of Earth, Shall feel a fresh unfolding, And a new immortal birth. My spirit, freed from trammels, Shall know nor toil nor time, But soar, for ever soaring, Eternal and sublime. These ears that scarce can hear you, O joyous children mine! Shall pulse to waves of music That flow from harps divine. Ev'n now angelic voices Come whispering soft and low, And I see the luminous fingers That point me where to go. Children, I'm going home, By the way the Past hath trod, To the place appointed for meâ To my Father and my God. Children, the way is weary, And the gate is dark and dreary, But on the outer side Are seraphs waiting for me, To comfort me and guide. THE SIGH OF THE PINE-TREES. I know what the forest saith, The forest of dark-green pines, That are moved by the wild wind's breath, When the cold clear starlight shines, And the tides of the deep air-ocean Come rolling through their lines. I know, but I cannot tell, For want of the mystic speech, And the words ineffable, That Wisdom cannot teach, Even on her highest mountain Where she sits beyond our reach. But I listen all night long To the low eternal sighâ To the melancholy song, Burthened with mysteries highâ Earth-moanings set to music On the harps of the upper sky. I listen all night through, And ever and ever I hear One word that seems as two, And two that mingle clear Into a third low whisper, Far off, but drawing near. I feel what the forest sings With its weird unearthly breath:â Three thoughtsâthree wordsâthree things: Sorrow and Love and Death. The mystery! the mystery! Behold what the pine-tree saith! THE FIGHT IN THE SANCTUARY. Through the aisles and arches solemn O'er each grey majestic column Of that silent, dim cathedral, Streamed the moonbeam all the night; Floating through the storied window, Flecked with many-coloured light; Floating through the chancel hoary, O'er the faces, flushed with glory, Of departed saints and heroes Carved in marble on the wall; O'er the silent great high altar, O'er the Bible, o'er the Psalter; O'er the organ, closed and voiceless, Mute to adoration's call, Fell the melancholy moonlight, Sleep-like, dream-like, over all. Suddenly, in lurid splendour, Red as Night, when storms attend her, Stood an Angel at the altar! Guest unbidden, sad to see; Flashing from his fiery eyeballs Scorn and Pride and Misery. âMine,â;he said, âthese paths enchanted, Mineâall mineâby evil haunted; Mine the transept, shrines, and chapels, Fretted roof, and marble floor; Mine the white-robed incense-flingers; Mine the choristers and singers; Mine the music of the organ, Loud as tempests on the shore; Mine the Saints and the Apostles, Mine, all mine, for evermore!â And he raised his hand in anger, And, with crash like iron clangour, Smote the pallid saints and heroes To the pavementâone and allâ Smote them down in tinkling fragments, From their niches on the wall. Overturned, with scorn infernal, Altars built to the Eternal; And with maniac start and frenzy, Struck the slumbering organ keys, Till they crashed like crag-born thunder, Till they moaned in wailing wonder, Jarring like the rush of whirlwinds When they vex the tropic seas, And with mighty war-ships toying, Snap them, like the twigs of trees. Then again, with fitful fancy, Or as moved by necromancy, Strode this dark and sullen Angel To the gloomiest shrine within; Kneeling down, as if repentant Of his misery and sin. But his thoughts were thoughts of evil, Prompted by the bitter Devil That possessed his wounded conscience, Racked by agony and pride; And he said, âCome, hot temptation, Come, the deepest degradation, Come, all turbulent unreason, Rule me, hold me, and divide! Good is evil! Hell's my pathway! Let Destruction be my guide!â Thus blaspheming, thus lamenting,â Proud, defiant, unrepenting,â Roamed he through the shadowy vistas, Darting darkness from his eyes; And through all that fane of Beauty Hurling groans and agonies. But in Passion's midway torrent, Self-sustained, though self-abhorrent, He beheldâand started wildly At such vision in the placeâ Golden haired, a radiant Angelâ Calm, beneficent Evangelâ Pouring splendours from his forehead; And his clear, unsullied face Filling all that grey cathedral, Sunlike, with supernal grace. And that Angel, mild and saintly, With sad visage, speaking faintly, SaidââDisturber and Destroyer, Troubler of a holy shrine! Hie thee to thy native darkness, And begone! this place is mine!â âNay!â;replied that Evil Spirit, âBy the power that I inherit, Mine's the Bible, mine's the Music, Mine's the roof, and mine's the floor! And I'll slay thee at the altar, Slay thee by the Book and Psalterâ Slay thee, as my highest duty To the fiends that I adore! Get thee gone from my dominion, Mine's the place for evermore!â And he raised his hand unholy, Smote that Angel sweet and lowly! Smote him on his cheek and bosom, Gashed his side with gaping wound; Till the meek and patient Seraph Lay as dead upon the ground! Then the great high organ pealing, All its sympathy revealing, Sent through chancels, crypts, and cloisters, Melodies of pain and wail; And one ray of moonlight falling, Through the outer gloom appalling, Crept upon the Angel's forehead, Glittering like a coat of mail; On his cheeks and closed eyelids, On his lips so lovely pale. Sudden, as from Death upspringing, With a shout, like triumph ringing, Rose the Angel from the pavement; And before the inner shrine, Grappled with the Fiend that smote him, Filled and fired with strength divine. Oh the combat, long and fearful! Oh the strife, so blood and tearful! Oh the agony and anguish, Madly felt or mildly borne, Which, through all the lonely places Where they fought with flashing faces, For the mastery and possessionâ Hopeful one, and one forlornâ Echoed till the strife was ended, At the dawning of the morn. Beamed the sunlight, pure and golden, Through the oriel windows olden, Filling all that high cathedral With magnificence of Day; When that Angel, evil-minded, Bruised and beaten, fled away: Spread his wings, in combat riven, And with groan that pierced to Heaven, Vanished from the shrine, polluted By his fury and despair. And his victor, maimed and bleeding, But triumphant, interceding For the foe that he had vanquished, Turned to God his forehead fair, And, while music filled the cloister, Eased his happy heart in prayer. THE OLD MAN BY THE RIVER. I'm an old, old man, sad river; I'm old and like to thee, That pourest thy weary waters To the all-engulfing sea; And I dream on thy mournful margin Of the darkening days to be. Thou art deep, and wide, and wealthy; And the laden ships come by, With the wine, and the corn, and the ingots, Their white sails flapping high;â But thou'st had thy fill of treasure, And scorn itâas do I. There's an unknown world before us, A cold and stormy gloom, That shall gather us up, sad river, In the darkness of our doom: Thee in the deep, deep ocean, Me in the yawning tomb. Let us dream of the past, O river! And the joyous days of old, When thou wert a brawling brooklet, On the hill-side, and the wold; And I was a laughing urchin, With hair like the woven gold. When we were glad in the sunshine, And stray'd by the birken bowers; When we sang, and leap'd, and frolicked, And played with the meadow flowers; While the laughter of girls made music In our morn and evening hours. Ere awayâfar awayâwe hurried To the world of strife and care, To the melancholy pine-woods, And heard in the upper air The wail and the rush of tempests That shook the forests bare. Away to the roaring rapids, All white with crested foam, Impatient of obstructionâ Where vessel never clomb;â Vagrant, and wild, and reckless, Intolerant of home. In recklessness of vigourâ Exuberant in glee, 'T was vain for solid Wisdom To preach to such as we, That heeded not Experience, And knew not of the sea. 'T was vain to speak of quiet To us who leaped and ran; Who scorned to curb existence By measurement and plan; Who courted Toil and Peril, And thought the world a span. On to the falls we hurried, Exulting in our way, And dashed o'er the chasms in thunder Through the long, long night and day; But ever in mid-day sunshine With rainbows in our spray. And thence we flowed, O river! Through the rich and level ground, Through the corn-fields and the meadows, With a calm and rippling sound; By the church upon the hill-top, And the hamlets lying round. Unresting and impatient, We thought of the wealthy shires; Of the wharves and docks far distantâ Of the cupolas and spires; And all the splendid city That shone through our desires. And thither we came, O river! Thither we came at last, And flowed with gentle current By stores and granaries vast, And heard the roar of people And the chariots rushing past. We bore upon our bosoms The cornâthe wineâthe oilâ The tribute of the ocean, And all the green earth's spoil: Whatever men delight in, For recompense of toil. But alas! for us, O river! Flowing through paths unclean, We lost the fairy freshness Of the days that once had beenâ The flowers of woodland meadows, And the sky's blue depths serene. No more the blithe lark cheered us A mile above his nest; No more the milkmaid chanted Of Love, and Love's unrest; Or children gathered daisies To float them on our breast. And we strayed from the busy city With all its weary gold, In search of the health and pleasure We lost in the days of old, Ere the youthful heart was hardened, And the fire of life was cold. Never! oh never! never! Shall Time these gifts restore; For the salt, salt waters meet us, Upflowing ever moreâ From the deeps of the bitter ocean, And the ever-widening shore! I stand on the mournful margin, And hear what the deep Sea saith. There are storm and cloud above it, And a low, long, wailing breath:â 'Tis for thee and for me, O river, And it calleth us down to Death! THE HEDGE IN THE GREEN LANE. Under the hedge where I recline, Screened from the sultry summer-shine, I have a garden fair to see, As good as the duke's, if it pleases me. And these my flowers: the slim harebell, With slender cups where the fairies dwell; And the dewy daisy, crimson tipped, As pure as a child, and as rosy-lipped; And golden-yellow, all glinting up, The celandine, and the buttercup, And the dandelion, with milky ring, Coins of the mintage of the Spring; And the pimpernel, that sleeps at noon, Like an Eastern maiden flushed with June; And the blue forget-me-not, flower of maids Who dream of Love in the evening shades; And the wild wood-strawberry, opening fair Its petals five to the sunny air: And the trailing ivy that braids and weaves, And makes a carpet of its leaves, Or climbs like a child to the gnarled knee Of the great, high-spreading, old oak tree; And the woodbine, scattering sweet perfume, And the meadow-sweet, and the bonnie broomâ Dear to our hearts for a thousand songs, Of Love's delight and lovers' wrongs; And briony, cousin of the vine, Up-clambering with its fingers fine, And hanging from each sheltering tree, Its garlands of embroidery, With sea-green berries and twisted rings, Fit for the diadems of kingsâ But far more fitting and bright and rare, As a wreath for childhood's forehead fair, Twined 'mid the curls of its sunny hair. And all these blooms in my garden grow, All in the hedge where the wild winds blow; And a hundred others as fair as they, That I could count in a summer-day, Under the hedge where I sit alone, Lulled by the bee with his trumpet tone, And the blithe lark singing from the sky My concert, and my lullaby. THE IVY AND THE BELL. In days when Alfred ruled the land, As ancient legends tell, The Ivy was a gardener's lad, And loved a lady well; And the Bell that hangs in the turret high Was the lady pure as snow, The only daughter of an earl, A thousand years ago. That lady fair, so bright and rare, Had suitors many a one, Both knights and earls, and knaves and churls, But she loved the gardener's son. They pledged their faith, in life or death, In happiness or woe, And sealed the promise with a ring, A thousand years ago. The grim earl read his magic book, And lo! before his sight, The deeds they did, the love they hid, Were clear as morning light. He swore an oath to slay them bothâ The maid for looking low, The gardener's lad for looking highâ A thousand years ago. By magic might he changed the lad Into an Ivy flower, And the lady bright to the booming Bell That swings in the donjon-tower. âBe this,â;quoth he, âthe doom they dree, Who guiled a father so!â And the grim earl burned his magic books, A thousand years ago. But every time the Bell was rung The Ivy spread and grew, âClimb to me! climb!â;said every chime, âO Ivy! ever true!â And the Ivy clomb an inch a day, As never did Ivy grow, And reached the Bell and covered it o'er, A thousand years ago. A mortal hand ne'er rang the Bell, But up in its turret high It pealed sweet tunes, like Norland runes, To the breeze that wandered by; And every year at Christmas Eve, As winds begin to blow, You may hear it ringâas oft it rang A thousand years ago. Sometimes merry, and sometimes sad, But always sweet and clear, And all who listen dream of Love, And the hearts they hold most dear. For Love's the same, and ever the same, Though ages ebb and flow;â O Love, be happier than thou wert A thousand years ago! THE GREAT OVERTHROW. âThere's not a Builder in the World Can build as well as Iâ So high and strong; so broad and long; So shapely and so high; With domes, and minarets, and towers, Defiant of the sky!â The giant spake; and Earth and men Looked on with bated breath;â A giant, manifold as Life, And terrible as Death. He grasped the mountains in his arms, And strewed them on the plain; He scooped new channels for the flood; He dyked the raging main; He dug into the pits of hell, And cried, âI reign! I reign!â Deep 'mid the ribs of Earth he laid His firm foundations all; And fire, and storm, and lightning-proof, He raised each lofty wall. Granite were tower and battlement, And marble, shaft and spire; With crystal domes above them all, Red in the morning's fire; Shining and shimmering, up to heaven, Higher, and ever higher! âCome hither! hither!â;the giant said, âYe priests and kings sublime; Hither, ye peoples of the earth, From every realm and clime! And see how deftly I can weave Iron and stone and lime. Come hither! and as ye pass, confess, Low bending, every one, There never was Builder such as I, Since Time his course begun;â Never a Building like to this, Under the pleasant sun.â Thus spake the Giant, superb and strong. The people surged and roaredâ âHe is the Master; he is the King, Acknowledged and adored! His buildings reach from Earth to Heavenâ He is the God and Lord!â Forth from the crowd a champion steppedâ A little child seemed he; His outstretched hand could barely reach The bend of the giant's knee; But his look was like the light of Heaven, When it streams on the stormy sea. And he said, âO boaster, and profane! 'Tis true thy hands are skilled, And great the towers and palaces, And temples thou canst build! But I can cast them to the earth; I can topple them down, By wave of my hand, by word of my mouth, By darkness of my frown, Turret and tower, and battlement, Down to the deep Earthâdown!â He raised a bugle to his lips, And blew, nor loud nor shrill, But softly as the breeze of noon, That waves on the grassy hill;â Softly and low as Pity's voice, That sighs to Grief âBe still!â Or a bride's when she kneels at the altar foot, And says to the priest, âI will.â Gently and slowly;âsoft and low;â But all the people heard;â 'Twas a light in their soulsâa thought in their heartsâ A lightâa thoughtâa word;â And they listened and listened, and listened on, But never spake or stirred. They listened and listened, and listened on, Till the notes so soft and low, Rose ever higher, and higher yet, As a wave when the wild winds blow; And rolledâand rollingâgathered strength, Like an avalanche of snow. They echoed in the people's heart; They smote on the giant's ear; The Earth was troubled where he stood; And his lips grew pale with fear; For he heard a rumbling underground, And saw his topmost towers Shake like the leaves of the clustering trees, When the cold wind bodeth showers, And the conscious forests feel the storm That gathers in the bowers. Was it of marble and porphyry, With all its rare device? Was it of iron and stone and gold? Or was it glittering ice? The turrets seemed to melt in the sun; The pinnacles fell in hail; And the solid walls rocked to and fro, Like ships in a stormy gale. And down, down, down on the Earth, The stately structure lay; And the Child upon the ruins stood, An Angel, bright as day; And cried with voice that shook the spheresâ âThus fall, and pass away, Builder and buildingâliar and lie;â Time shall restore them never! They were but shadows in the stream; They were but fancies in a dream;â But I endure for ever!â ITHURIEL. Through the wide world he goes, Surrounded by his foes, And sees each ancient Falsehood where it hives; He strikes them with his spear, And, lo! in daylight clear, They spring full-armed, and struggle for their lives. They call on kings and laws To aid their sacred causeâ On Church with its anathemas to ban;â For dungeon and for stake, Or wheel, his limbs to breakâ A mournful fate is hisâIthuriel;âyet a man! No scaly monsters hid In grove or pyramid, Though robed as angels to deceive his eyes, Can hide them from his glance, Or puncture of the lance, With which he strips them of their false disguise. Sad hero! most maligned And wronged of human kind, Because he scorns the falsehoods we revere! Why should he earn their hate? The world's the Farm of Fate, And Fate must reap the corn. Ithuriel! break thy spear! IN THE GREENWOOD. 'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood, The longest day of June, And not a cloud in the bonnie blue sky To cool the breeze of noon, Or a sound to startle the turtle-dove, Cooing her drowsy tune. 'Tis merry, 'tis merry, through all the shire, In the air so blithe and freeâ 'Tis merry in cottage, merry in hall, Merry in croft and leaâ But merry, merry, merriest yet, Under the greenwood tree. Merry!âand yet the pike in the stream Lurks low in the pools to slay; And the starling chases the golden moth, And the finch makes the worm his prey, And the hawk hath a beak that is red with blood, As he soars in the light of day. Merry!âand yet in the gay greenwood, There lies a lady fair, With a gash in her throat that her lover hath made, And the blood-clots in her hair. Follow him, fiends, that shall rack his heart! Lie down in his bed, Despair! Follow him, Darkness! follow him, Light! Pillow, betray his head! Grass of the greenwood, stones of the street, Disclose his guilty tread! Point at him, Earth! And thou, O Heaven! Bear witness for the dead! THE TOP SAWYER OF ROTTENTOWN, AND HOW HE VOTED. No, No! Master Dodge, You're a clever lawyer, But I'm not your manâ I'm my own Top Sawyer. I've a loving wife; I've a son and daughter; I've a ten-pound note, Beef, and Bread, and Water. If I fancy Wine, I've the cash to buy it; And my right arm's strongâ Would you like to try it? I've a vote, I know, And I mean to use it As I please myself, Not as you may choose it;â Not a vote to sell For your dirty guineasâ Baits that only catch Knaves and stupid ninnies. Think you, Master Dodge, I resemble either? If I do, I'm dead; If I live, I'm neither! He who asks my vote Must, if I support him, Hold the patriot's course When the factious court him. He must know the right; Love the people duly; Teach them when they're wrong; Serve them well and truly! And when England fights, With the world upon her, He must aid her cause, And maintain her honour. He must hold the scales Evenly for all menâ Justly for the great, Fairly for the small men. Friendly to the poorâ When hard taxes grieve them, He must help the State Wisely to relieve them; And must own the truth, That a Christian nation Owes its meanest child Healthful education! Yet I'll give no vote To an idle meddler, Or a busy drone Higgling like a peddler; To a man who prates In and out of season, Thinking Wisdom's self Meaner than his reason; With no larger views Than his parish offers;â Him I'll not support, Whatsoe'er he proffers. No! I want a man True, and good, and hearty, Loving England more Than he loves his party; In great Freedom's troop, Who will serve unheeding, Soldier in the ranks, Or a Captain leading! If such man I find, Be he Jones or Hodges, He shall have my vote, Spite of all the Dodges! THE POOL OF ST. FILLANS. [The Pool of St. Fillans, in the Highlands of Perthshire, was celebrated in early ages as a place of resort for the cure of idiocy or insanity. Immersion in its healing watersâaccompanied by adequate offerings to the shrine of the saint âwas believed to work a cure in the most desperate cases.] For thirty long years on the side of the mountain I've guarded Thy pool, O St. Fillans!âlast hope of a desolate heart; For thirty sad years I have sat at thy spring unrewarded: False Saint! and false Fountain! I'll take up my cross and depart. Hither come young and fair, Hither comes hoary hair, Hither comes Hope with a light in her fast-fading eyes; Hither comes humbled Wealth, Begging the crumbs of Health, Which Fate, like proud Lazarus, sits 'mid the stars and denies. O cheating St. Fillans! I brought thee my boy in his childhood, And now he's a man, and his hair is besprinkled with gray. What hast thou done for him? Roams he not yet in the wild-wood Darkâin the Night of Unreasonâunconscious of Day? Have I not watched and wept, While o'er his features crept, Sparkles of light evanescent as gleams on the wave? Or, as in waters cast Shadow of bird that passed, Or glow of the far-flashing steel in the grasp of the brave? Idle! all idle!âSad Fountain, I've lost my reliance! Thou canst not endow him with soul that he never enjoyed! Selfish and proud I may be, setting God at defiance, In craving the boon for my child which His wisdom destroyed. Happy and thoughtless he, All the grief lies with me! Let me endure it, and cease to lament and deplore, 'Tis but a soul asleep In the earth-prison deep,â Heaven shall awake it, in Freedom and Light evermore. THE BEAUTIFUL UNBEAUTIFUL. Wife or maiden, fresh and fair, What avails thy sunbright hair, Rolling o'er thy shoulders free, Like the full tide of the sea, Kissing the white sands wantonly? What avail thy glancing eyes, Blue as nights in Paradise? Or the fire that in them lies, Though it might make pale the morn, If thou'rt hard of heart and scorn, Or hast set thyself on high For thine own idolatry? If thou love thyself alone, Every beauty now thine own Would be better carved in stone. Every winsome charm or grace Of the eye, the voice, the face, Comes from spirit throned withinâ All the rest is husk of sin. If we search the wide world through, None can please us but the true. Beauty is the growth of mind; None are lovely but the kind. THE KING'S VISITORS. The King holds court With his regal train, And the wild wind blows At his window pane, And pattering falls The wintry rain; And if the King, So merry and free, Would give his crown And his kingdom's fee, And his fleets that ride On the wide wild sea, To stop the fall Of the midnight rain; The gushing, flushing, Frolicsome rain, And silence the wind At his window paneâ He'd offer his riches All in vain! And Care crawls up To the great King's door, And takes her seat At his proud heart's core, And tells him deeds That were done of yore; And if he'd give His good right hand, His Dukes and Earls That round him stand, And his Queen's bright eyes, That glad the land, To keep such guest From his darkening doorâ The nestling, wrestling Fiend of yoreâ And take her tooth From his heart's red coreâ The Fiend would answer him: âNever more!â APPLES. Dainty apples, lip inviting, Ripe and rosy every one; Bounteous summer's freshest comers, Tinted by the morning sun! Yours to pluck them, thirsty mortal, Nought but pleasure can befallâ Foolish taster! Pleasure waster! Dead Sea Apples, one and all! Apples? No! But Beauty's kisses, Balm and cure for every woe; Seeds of passionâfruit of raptureâ Dearest boon the Fates bestow. Come and woo them, and pursue them, Ye who pine in Sorrow's thrall;â Foolish tasters! pleasure wasters! Dead Sea Apples, one and all! Kisses? No! But golden ingots, Gold, the cynosure of Earth; King of BeautyâLord of Dutyâ Standard, pledge, and proof of worth. Come and clutch the sparkling treasure, Ye who'd stand where others fall:â Foolish tasters! Pleasure wasters! Dead Sea Apples, one and all! Ingots? No! But dear Companions, Friends in Fortune's darkest day: Dearer, truer, firmer, newer, When Life's brightness fades awayâ Friends that if you're down will lift you, Ready at your slightest call! Foolish tasters! Pleasure wasters! Rotten Apples, one and all! THE âWAR-CHRISTIAN.â What say the aisles and chancels Of old cathedrals dim? What saith the pealing organ In chant or solemn hymn?â Fervour of Adoration, And Love in sweet accord; Love for the meanest mortal, And Glory to the Lord! What saith the learned preacher So high above the crowd, With his hands so white and dainty, And his heart so black and proud? He draws a little circle As narrow as his mind, And shuts from all beyond it God's mercy to mankind. He rants, he raves, he blusters, And from his sensual jaws Pours ribald slang, mistaking Men's laughter for applause; And, when the land is deluged With blood and widows' tears, Incites redoubled slaughter, And prates of guns and spears; Forgetful or defiant That He whose cause he shames, Whose Gospel he dishonours, Whose teaching he disclaims, Was Lord of Loving-kindness, And taught that war should cease; That swords should turn to ploughshares, And nations live in peace. I'd rather for my teachers Have wild winds on the shore, Or breeze amid the branches, Or birds that sing and soar, Or Silence, high and holyâ Than Bigot such as he, Who dares to measure mercy, And knows not Charity. New York, January, 1863. FLOWERS AND CHILDREN. Oh the flow'rets, the bonnie wee flow'rets, Glinting and smiling and peeping through the grass! And oh the children, the bonnie little children, I see them and love them and bless them as I pass! I bless themâbut I'm sad for themâ I wish I could be glad for them, For who, alas! can tell me the Fate that shall befall? The flow'rets of the morning, The greenwood path adorning, May be scattered ere the noontime by the wild wind's sudden call; Or plucked because they're beautiful, By rudest hands, undutiful; Or trampled underfoot by the cattle of the stall; And the smiling little children, the bonnie little children, That sport like happy moths in the sunny summer sheen, May perish ere the day-time Of their sweet expected May-time, And sleep beneath the daisies and the long grass growing green; Or a worse, worse fate may light on them, And cast more fatal blight on them: The bonnie little maiden may be wooed and cast away. And the bonnie boy prove ruthless, Or cowardly, or truthless, Or a gold-adoring hypocrite before his head be gray. But oh, ye fairy blossoms! whatever be the Future, I would not, if I might, peer through its awful glass. Bloom, flowerets of the wild wood! Rejoice, O happy childhood! I look at you and love you and bless you as I pass. THE RED AND YELLOW LEAF IN OCTOBER. Not when the jocund Spring arose, And, smiling off the winter snows, Released thee from the bursting bud, With all thy sisters of the wood, And bared thee, tender, fresh, and green, To morning flush and evening sheen, Wert thou, old leaf upon the bough, So softly beautiful as now. Not when the radiant Summer trod, Gift-bearing, o'er the expectant sod, And shot from all his eyes of fire, Fruition to the Earth's desire, And spread thy surface to the storm In ripe maturity of form, Wert thou so fair as now thou art, When all thy youthful charms depart. October, with his warning breath, Hath whispered of approaching death; And sprinkled o'er thy smiling face A new, but melancholy grace, Of gorgeous hues, more deftly planned Than all the Summer could commandâ Of amber, purple, red, and gold, To crown thee, now thou'rt growing old. So among us, green leaves of men, That flourish threescore years and ten, All is not loss that dims our day, And robs us of the pride of May: The vernal bloom, the Summer glow, Leave kindly traces as they go; And Man's old age, if true and brave, Marches in glory to the grave. THE RIM OF THE BOWL. I sat 'mid the flickering lights, when all the guests had departed, Alone at the head of the table, and dreamed of the days that were gone; Neither asleep nor waking, nor sad, nor cheery-heartedâ But passive as a leaf by the wild November blown. I thoughtâif thinking 't were, when thoughts were dimmer than shadowsâ And toyed the while with the music I drew from the rim of the bowl, Passing my fingers round, as if my will compelled it To answer my shapeless dreams, as soul might answer soul. Idle I was, and listless; but melody and fancy Came out of that tremulous dulcimer, as my hand around it strayed; The rim was a magic circle, and mine was the necromancy That summoned its secrets forth, to take the forms I bade. Secrets! ay! buried secrets, forgotten for twenty summers, But living anew in the odours of the roses at the board; Secrets of Truth and Passion, and the days of Life's unreason; Perhaps not all atoned for, in the judgments of the Lord. Secrets that still shall slumber, for I will not bare my bosom To the gaze of the heartless, prying, unconscion-able crowd, That would like to know, I doubt not, now much I have sinned and suffered, And drag me down to its levelâbecause it would humble the proud. Beautiful spirits they were, that danced on the rim at my bidding: Spirits of Joy or Sadness, in their brief sweet Summer day; Spirits that aye possess me, and keep me, if I wander, In the line of the straight, and the flower of the fruitful way. Spirits of women and childrenâspirits of friends departedâ Spirits of dear companions that have gone to the levelling tomb, Hallowed for ever and ever with the sanctity of sorrow, And the aureole of death that crowns them in the gloom. Spirits of Hope and Faith, and one supremely lovely, That sang to me years agone, when I was a little child, And sported at her footstool, or lay upon her bosom, And gazed at the Love that dazzled me from her eyes so soft and mild. And that song from the rim of the bowl came sounding and sounding everâ As oft it hath done before in the toil and moil of life; A song nor sad nor merry, but low and sweet and plaintive; A clarion blast in sorrow; an anodyne in strife; A song like a ray of moonlight that gleams athwart a tempest. Sound ever, O Song! sound sweetly, whether I live or die, My guardian, my adviser, my comforter, my comrade, A voice from the sinless regionsâa message from the sky! THE NOBLE SPIRITS. [To the memory of Patrick Park, sculptor, Alexander Mackay, journalist, and Angus Bethune Reach, poet and novelist.] Alas! for the noble spirits that have fought and passed away In the stern and grim life-battle, in the morning of their day, Panting, struggling, perishing in the sulphur of the fray! How many and how gallant, I have seen them at my side, Their bright eyes flashing glory from the strength of a world defied, In the blaze of their ambition, and the splendour of their pride! Alas! for the noble spirits! they knew notâno not one, The pang and the fret and the fever of the course 't was theirs to runâ The pang and the fret and the fever under the partial sun. They thought the world was with them and under-stood their pain, Their hunger of distinction, their hope of heights to gain On the topmost crest of the mountain, the watch-tower of the plain. They thought if their youthful voices could reach the toiling crowd, That the good and the brave would answer in echoes long and loud, That would stir the hearts of the humble, and humble the hearts of the proud. They thought if the world would listen to a new immortal rhyme, Tender and strong and hopeful, or earnest and sublime, That they might be the Shakspeares and Miltons of their time. They thought their teeming fancy could stock the world anew, With nobler art-creations than poet ever drewâ With passionate romances and tales of the wild and true. They thought that Earth and Ocean and the free rejoicing air, The heights of human passion and the depths of its despair, Should have no hidden secrets, that they might not declare. They thought the bounds of Science were wide as earth and heaven And that to them, high-daring, the privilege was given To pierce the outer circle, and soar above the levin, Up to the founts of Knowledge beyond the starry zone, Where Nature works her wonders, inscrutable, alone, And the blaze of noon seems darkness at the footstool of her throne. They thought their names should glitter in the history of man, The seers and standard-bearers of a new and better plan Than sages ever dreamed of since human grief began. They thoughtâalas! what matters? Their thoughts were but as dreams Or wasted seeds, borne seaward in the roaring of the streams, To take no root in the furrows where Earth's full harvest gleams. The world misunderstood them, or never cared to know, And took no heed of the treasure they panted to bestow In prodigal profusion of bounteous overflow; And set them, the great-hearted, to drudgery obscure, To toil for daily bread with the poorest of the poor, 'Mid pain and sorrow and anguish, and bonds that slaves endure. It set themâsteeds of Heavenâwith wings from their shoulders spread, To plough the stubborn clay-lands, with aching heart and head, Or to drag the city chariots, or the hearses of the dead; It broke their heart and spirit, till they pined and died awayâ Some chafing and resentful, like the wild deer driven to bay; Some patient and forgiving, and weary of the day. Some in the open market that all the world might see The sin and shame and sorrow that thing like this should be; Some in remote dim corners, under the wild wood tree. Some with their fine brain shattered and jangled out of gear By the rude hand of Affliction, and weight of Toil severe, That crushed the Soul's dome palace, and dulled its lustre clear. Some with the bread untasted, that, had it come when earned, Might have given the flickering life-light the oil for which it yearned, And sent it spire-like upward, rejoicing as it burned. Some with a bold defiance through all neglect and scorn, And a Hope which grew Conviction, that judges yet unborn Would pluck their names from the darkness where they had sunk forlorn And write them large and splendid on the musterroll of Fame, Amid the old Immortals, that glow like living flame On the broad front of the ages, eternally the same. Ay! that the cruel millions in swift approaching hours Would throng to their graves remorseful and cover them with flowers, And say, âThey died too earlyâtheir heritage is ours: âOurs are their teeming fanciesâtheir songs of hope and cheer, That stir our hearts like clarions when the battle draweth nearâ The shock of Truth with Falsehood, when Right shall at last appear.â Alas for the noble spirits! alas for the crowd ingrate! That is deaf to its benefactors, though early and long and late They preach in the high and byways to men of all estateâ Too ignorant and sordid to care for truth sublime; That love but the chink of money at morn or even time, Or the senseless jest and laughter of mountebank and mime. Alas for the noble spirits!âthe young, the true, the brave!â No tear-drop for their sorrow, no tombstone for their grave, Shall atone for the wrong you've done them, O crowd that would not save! O crowd without a conscience! their fitful race is run; They have fought and bled and suffered under the partial sun: And you misunderstood them;âand slew themâevery one. THE BARD'S LAST SONG. I When I was young, unwise, and free, And dreamed of things that could not be This side of man's mortality, I loved a maid of heavenly birth, Friend of my sorrow and my mirth, The queen and paragon of Earth. Sweet was the music of her tongue, Upon her lips all wisdom hung, And streamed abroad like sunlight flung. I gathered fragrance from her sighs, And through the glory of her eyes Had glimpses into Paradise. My heart was quick to understand; I took her child-like by the hand, And wandered with her through the land. Through meadow-paths at break of morn, When dews hung gem-like on the thorn, And from the clouds above the corn, The lark poured music in a shower; Through forest-glade to wild-wood bower Leaf-sheltered from the noontide hour; O'er upland tracts of virgin snow, Where timid rivers learn to flow, And leap to reach the world below; Up to the mountain's topmost peak, Breasting the wild winds blowing bleak, With flashing eye and rose-red cheek; Up to its very crest and crown, Men and their madness far adown, Heaven and its glories all our own; We wandered heedless of the roar Of Commerce weltering on the shore, Buzzing and whirling evermore; And there we'd sit from Noon to Night, Her smile my joy, her eyes my light, Enraptured in the Infinite; Or mused on things above the ken Of the dumb-sorrowing herd of men, Unuttered by their tongue or pen. II But chiefly loved my Love and I, When thunder clomb the Evening sky, And shrill sea-gusts came piping by, To sit upon the sea-beach lone, And list the wild waves' undertoneâ The low soft melancholy moan, As if the Deep's deep heart did plain, And throb with memories of pain: Remorseful for Earth's children slainâ For their reliance most unwise, On placid seas and favouring skies, To float and waft their argosies:â The weird-like musie of the sea Disclosed its mournful mystery, And spake in words to her and me, Which took the rhythm of keens and runes, That sank or swoll in plaintive tunes, Such as corpse-watching beldam croons, Forlornest 'mid the troop forlorn That weep some widow's eldest-born, Untimely from her bosom torn. Lulled by that chant and hymn sublime, We'd read some book of ancient time, Of love and agony and crime; And wonder if our dull To-Day Had heart for passions great as they, To liftâto tortureâor to slay: If Love were ready as of old To yield dominion, glory, gold, All power, all joy, all bliss untold, For sake of Love. If mortal Hate, Immortal grown, and fixed as Fate, Could guard its throne inviolate, Though heavenly Merey should implore To stay the vengeance which it bore, And make it human as before. Nor wondered long, nor long inquired, But to the city, domed and spired, Retraced our steps, and never tired To mingle with the human throng, To learn the weakness of the strong, Or gleam that led the righteous wrong: The meanness of the great and proud, The greatness of the meanest bowed In foulest corners of the crowd; The sameness, evermore the same, Of human glory, human shame, And all that men most praise or blame, In every clime and every age, And written on the living page, As man's perpetual heritage. Till worn and wearied and deprest By study of that sharp unrest, Each day the morrow's palimpsest, We'd dry our gathering tears, and sayâ âThis is no place for us to stay; Let us be merry, and away!â III And then she'd wave a mystic wand, And with one motion of her hand Waft us afar to Fairyland, Untrammelled, unconfined, to roam, With Elf or Dryad, Sylph or Gnome, Or sportive Nereid of the foamâ To talk with spirits of the glade, And nymphs of river and caseade, And fairy folk of greenwood shade; To sail with Mab on fleeciest shred Of morning cloudlet overhead, Three minutes ere the sun upsped; To seale the rainbow's sevenfold height, Its mingling stairs of roseate light, And twist its colours into white. Or when the Night came darkening down, And grey had deepened into brown On the small ant-hill of the town, To steer witch-fashion through the gloom, Astride with Hecate on a broom, With sea and sky for elbow-room, And hear no sound of human kind, Nought but the rushing of the wind, Or roll of thunder far behind; Or higher up the deeps of Heaven, By wilder freaks of fancy driven, Above the anvils of the levin, To seize the streaming Northern lights, And flaunt them from the Polar heights To cheer the gloom of Arctic nights. IV Idle I seemed, but was not so; Filled with a fierce desire to know, I would know all things known below: Study all Art, all Science probe, Were it as solid as the Globe, Or flimsy as a midge's robe; Would, without weariness or pause, Dive into principles and laws; And, mounting from effect to cause, For mine and for my love's behoof, Would track to utmost verge of proof The web of Nature, warp and woof. Each modern light or ancient lore I would examine and explore Through narrow chink or open door. Whatever since the world began Had been discussed or dreamed by man I would investigate and scan; And all for her, mine other soul, My light of life, my being's goal, Essence, quintessence, part and whole. And yet not so;âto me far more Than all the teeming earth could pour, Alike my blossom and my storeâ She knelt with me at holier shrine, And took my homage all divine To offer to her God and mine; With adoration's silent awe, To God from whom our breath we draw, The Light, the Life, the Love, the Law. V So passed my youth's delicious time, My budding spring, my fruitful prime, And all my thoughts took shape in rhyme. And then my wizard harp I strung, And o'er the chords my fingers flung, And bade men listen as I sung. Few heard me when the mandate went, Though to their throbbing hearts I sent The lightnings of my firmament. The arrowy words with purpose strong That told the tale of human wrong, And Justice sure, though tarrying long. Th' ennobling song that cheered the poor, And taught the wretched to endure The griefs that Love alone could cure. But larger audience came at lastâ Their hearts my sea; my words the blast That lashed their billows as I passed, And curled the waters into spray In the clear sunshine of the day, That gleamed and sparkled in the lay. And men awarded me the fame That I would snatch to crown my name, The lambent wreath of flickering flame, That round my temples twined and bowed, And marked me out above the crowd As one with deeper grief endowed Than they could bear: as one who knew Intenser joy; whose keener view Could pierce the outer darkness throughâ Down the abyss of Time to see, And strive in words that God made free To unfold a mighty mystery. VI All this I was, all this I did; And Time that o'er my temples slid Seemed but to pile the pyramid Of my renown; but never told That I was growing poor and old, And could not live for lack of gold. And when mine eyes, that opened late To smallness of mine own estate, Surveyed the powerful and the great, I found that meaner men than I, Mere feeders in the human sty, Without my gifts or purpose high, My love, my conscience, or my wit, Were called on judgment-seats to sit, Or found in senates audience fit: That some, my friends of early day, The comrades of my work or play In joyous boyhood's lusty May, Had riches teeming to their will; I not enough to eat my fill, Or pay my tailor's humble bill. That they were counted great and wise, The cynosures of Beauty's eyes; And Iâa beggar in disguise, That had no right at Nature's board, Or claim to tangible reward Of corn or wine, around me stored. And that 't was still the people's faith That fame, the flotsam of their breath, Sufficed for Life as well as Death; And that an epitaph alone Was more than ample to atone For all the wrongs the Bard had known; For every proud man's disrespect, For all a life's adventure wrecked, For scorn, for hunger and neglect. I struck my wild harp once again, But not in anger, though in pain, And sang one melancholy strain, With beating pulse and throbbing brow, The last mine energies allow, The mournful song I'm singing now. So write the tomb's recording lineâ Such fate was Milton's the divine, Why should I grieve that it is mine?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS. DYING. A CHORUS OF ANGELS. Come away! come away! Life is too sad for thee; Chill are its winds on thy delicate breast! Earth is too rude for theeâHeaven shall be glad for theeâ Come away, lovely one: come to thy rest! Low in thy narrow bed, Lay down thy gentle head; Give back to mother Earth all she can crave: All thy mortality, Doomed to finality, Leave it behind in the dust of the grave. Come away! come away! Earth is not meant for thee: Beautiful spirit, mount up to the sky! Men who have lost thee shall mourn and lament for thee, Thou shalt rejoice in thy glory on high. Spread thy bright wings, and soar Spotless for evermore; Sin-stained no longer, but white and forgiven: Heir of infinity, Robed in divinity, Come away, happy oneâcome up to Heaven! THE BROOK. Oft by the margin of this brook, When summer eves grew long, I've roamed, and dreamed, and read the book Of love and true love's wrong; And pined, poor visionary boy! That knew, nor thought of guile, To tempt the hidden depths of joy That dwelt in woman's smile. The blithe birds sang, the sweet bells rang, And fair the sunlight shone, And the brook made music as it went Merrily ever on. I rushed into the maze of men, And found the joy I sought, A joy I would not taste again, For misery it brought. I only tasted to despair; And here again, forlorn, Beside the stream I doze and dream, And sigh that I was born. The blithe birds sing, the sweet bells ring, The brooklet chafes the shore; But the music and the joy are lost Ever and evermore! VANITY LET IT BE. Through wild-wood valleys roaming, A maiden by my side, I vowed to love her evermore, My beautiful, my bride. âAll is vanity! vanity!â A wise man said to me: I pressed my true love's yielding hand, And answeredâfrank and freeâ âIf this be vanity who'd be wise? Vanity let it be!â I sat with boon companions, And quaffed the joyous wine, We drank to Worth with three times three, To Love with nine times nine. âAll is vanity! vanity!â Said Wisdom, scorning me: We filled our goblets once again, And sang with hearty gleeâ âIf this be vanity, Hip! Hurrah! Vanity let it be!â SPIRITS AND ANGELS. Lonely musing in the twilight, When the lengthening shadows fall, Spirits bright and holy Angels Come obedient to my call: Lost and loved ones gone before me, Phantoms fair from memory won, Seem to flit before my Fancy, Midway to the setting sun. I can see them, robed in Beauty, Some rejoicing, some forlorn, Friendly all, and sent to guide me Out of Darkness into Morn. On the chimes I hear their voices Whispering solace from the skies. Holy Angels, hover near me! Fit my soul for Paradise! LOVE DEFENDED. [AirââOld English.â] Once I thought Love had wrought all the griefs that haunt me; All the care and despair laid on me to daunt me; All the fears, and the tears shed in life's long trial. Now I know 'tis not so, and make bold denial. Love has giv'n hope of Heavenâfound when grief oppressed me; Thoughts that fired and inspired, purified and blessed me. Light in rainâjoy in painâin all doubt, endeavour, Come what will, Love shall still be my guide for ever! LOVE IS DEAD. Love is dead; Love is dead: Where shall we bury him? Bury him under the deep, deep sea, Moody and vicious, Wild and capricious, Dark and deceitful and cruel as he. Love is dead; Love is dead: This be his epitaphâ âHere lies a spiritâfar-seeingâyet blind, Fathomless mystery, Blood-red in history, Tyrant, and blessing, and curse of mankind.â Love is dead; Love is dead: Then must Earth follow himâ Earth and her children all born of his breath: Man and his glory, Time and its story, Suns, stars, and systems, down! down into Death! BAR THE DOOR. 'Tis true, good wife, our gold is scant; But Discontent is sin, And there is nothing that we want That Labour cannot win. We'll keep the fireside bright at home, And if the wild winds roar, We'll up and bar the door, good wifeâ Up and bar the door. Though neighbour Smith sell dust for spice, And rob the hedge for tea; Though Jones's scales, with constant vice, Make two and two but three, On wealth acquired by means like these, However large its store, We'll up and bar the door, good wifeâ Up and bar the door. When Folly knocks and tells its tale Of sudden fortunes won, And hints of schemes that cannot failâ Bright glittering in the sun; In Folly's face, that cheats itself, And many a thousand more, We'll up and bar the door, good wifeâ Up and bar the door. When Dodge comes down to bribe our town, Head-weak, but money-strong, And fawns and lies, and vainly tries To prove the right the wrong: His bribes, his party, and himself, We'll utterly abhor, And up and bar the door, good wifeâ Up and bar the door. When asked to quit my own fireside, To mix in public brawls, I'll do my work and never shirk, Though all the parish calls; Mine own affairs claim all my cares, And when the town's implore, We'll up and bar the door, good wifeâ Up and bar the door. THE LITTLE MAN. There was a little, very little, Quiet little man, He wore a little overcoat The colour of the tan; And when his weekly wage was earned On Saturday at night, He had but half-a-crown to spare To keep his spirit light; âBut that,â;quoth he, and twirled his thumb, So blithe he was, and free, âIs quite enough for happiness For a little man like me.â And oft this little, very little, Happy little man, Would talk a little to himself About the great world's plan: âThough people think me very poor, I feel I'm very glad, And this I'm sure could scarcely be If I were very bad. Rich knaves who cannot rest o' nights At every turn I see, While cosy sleep unbidden comes To a quiet man like me. âFor though I'm little, very little, Do whate'er I can, Yet every morning when I shave I shave an honest man; And every night when I go home, My winsome little wife, Receives me smiling at the door, And loves me more than life:â And this is joy that kings themselves, If thoughts were spoken free, Might give their sceptres to exchange With a little man like me. âAnd I've a little, quite a little, Bonnie little child, A little maid with golden hair, And blue eyes bright and mild; She sits and prattles on my knee, She's merry as a song, She's pleasant as a ray of light, She keeps my heart from wrong. And so, let kingdoms rise or fall, I'll earn my daily fee, And think the world is good enough For a little man like me.â A CHRISTMAS GLEE. Pleasant is the sound of the waves upon the shore, Racing and rejoicing, and rolling evermore; Pleasant is the chant of the torrent on the hill, Singing to the lowlands all the midnight chill; Pleasant is the tune of the north wind, ringing sharp, Playing on the forest as a maiden on a harp; But pleasanter and merrier the gurgling of the wine, Where Wit and Wisdom gather, and the eyes of Beauty shine; Where the glasses clink as treble to the bass of our âHa! Ha!â Fill the bumpers up again! âHip! Hip! Hip! Hurrah!â HEY! THE GREEN HOLLY! My false love has sailed o'er the wide wild main, The blossoms fall when the tempests blow,â And left me alone to my sorrow and pain; Green is the grass beneath the snow: And I never shall see his face again. Sing, Hey! the green Hollyâthe Ivy, oh! But the tall tree braves the sudden blast, Though the blossoms fall when the tempests blow, And the days to come may be fair as the past,â Green is the grass beneath the snow: And my first love need not be my last. Sing, Hey! the green Hollyâthe Ivy, oh! Let him goâI'll neither weep nor sigh: Though the blossoms fall when the tempests blow, After the cloud comes a light in the sky,â Green is the grass beneath the snow: And somebody loves me, and somebody's nigh. Sing, Hey! the green Hollyâthe Ivy, oh! THE BONNIE WEE BIRD. When I was young, and blithe, and free, A wee bird sat in the hawthorn tree. Ever at morn its sweet notes rang, Ever at night it trilled and sang:â âLove is the ruler of the wise, Love is the light of earth and skies, Love is the path to Paradise.â And now that the flush of youth has gone, Still the bonnie wee bird sings on. I hear it high in the summer cloud, I hear it clear when the storm grows loud:â âThe wrong is wrong but for a day; The wild wind blows the smoke away, And right is right, for ever and aye.â When nations moan in wild unrest, By king or kaiser sore opprest, I hear far off that wee bird's songâ Sad, yet hopeful; sweet, but strong:â âThe sword shall fail them by-and-by, The people's hour is drawing nigh!â Bonnie wee bird, sing high! sing high! OUR SOCIAL REPUBLIC. (AT THE CLUB OF âTHE HOOKS AND EYES.â) AirââPray, Goody, please to moderate.â] In this Republic where we sit, Each man his glass in hand, Free as the birds that chant in upper air, Be this the Charter of our wit, That all may understand, And these the taxes every one must bear. Lightly, brightly, Let the wit abound; And temperance pass In every glass, That sparkles in our round; And he who jeers at Woman's Truth, Or tips his jest with gall, Or scorns the man that nobly dares be poorâ Whate'er his age, whate'er his youth, A traitor to us all, He shall be banished! banished evermore! But he, the generous citizen, Whose jests are pure, though keenâ Who laughs his laugh, and sings his hearty songâ Who aids the cause of honest men, His country and his Queen, And bears no hate, except the hate of wrong; Duly, truly, One of us is he; To all our rights, Through joyous nights, We give him welcome free. To this Republic where we sit, Each man the other's friend, And bolt all knaves and scorners from our door, To feasts where wisdom, mirth, and wit, With social pleasures blend, We make him welcome, welcome evermore! THE CHOICE. I will tell, for I have chosen Where my bosom friend shall be;â Not where hollyhocks are flaunting, But where violets scent the lea; Not where gaudy parrots chatter, But where larks and linnets sing; Not with dahlias of the Autumn, But with lilies of the Spring. Ever birds of plainest plumage Scatter sweetest music round; Ever flowers of richest odour Grow the nearest to the ground. So I'll tell my heart's best secret, Where my bosom friend shall be; Not where haughty riches gather Needy knaves to bend the knee; Not where Pride looks down on Merit, Or where Beauty dwells with Scorn, But where Wealth is linked with Goodness, And the best are noblest born. For the humblest are the wisest, And the meek are glory-crowned; And the sweetest-scented flow'rets Grow the nearest to the ground. THERE'S A LAND, A DEAR LAND. There's a land, a dear land, where the rights of the free, Though firm as the Earth are as wide as the Sea; Where the primroses bloom, and the nightingales sing, And the honest poor man is as good as a king. Showery! Flowery! Tearful! Cheerful! England, wave-guarded, and green to the shore! West land! Best land! Thy land! My land! Glory be with her, and Peace evermore! There's a land, a dear land, where our vigour of soul Is fed by the tempests that blow from the Pole; Where a slave cannot breathe or invader presume, To ask for more Earth than will cover his tomb. Sea land! Free land! Fairest! Rarest! Home of brave men and the girls they adore! Fearless! Peerless! Thy land! My land! Glory be with her, and Peace evermore! COME IF YOU DARE! A SONG FOR THE RIFLE VOLUNTEERS. Come if you dare, loud vaunting foeman! Come if you dare to our isles of the sea. Come if you dare, soldier or yeoman! We'll give you a welcome befitting the free. Our rifles are ready, our aim shall be steady, We'll show you the teeth of the wolf in its lair, And give the full strength of you Graves the full length of you; Yes! every man of you, Come if you dare! Come if you dare, reivers and raiders! Come if you dare to our beautiful shore; Come if you dare, saucy invaders! Many or few you'll return nevermore. One purpose shall fire us, one thought shall inspire us, Each bullet we drive shall be true to a hair; We'll give the full strength of you Graves the full length of you, Yes! every man of you, Come if you dare! THE END.</field>
