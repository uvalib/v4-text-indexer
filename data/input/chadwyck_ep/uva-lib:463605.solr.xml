      <field name="fulltext">Il Pastor Fido The faithful shepheard with an addition of divers other poems Concluding with a short discourse of the long Civill Warres of Rome To His Highnesse the Prince of Wales Patiarque vel inconsultus haberi. Horat. AN ODE Vpon occasion of His Majesties Proclamation in the yeare 1630. Commanding the Gentry to reside upon their Estates in the Country Now warre is all the world about, And every where Erynnis raignes, Or else the Torch so late put out The stench remaines. Holland for many yeares hath beene Of Christian tragedies the stage, Yet seldome hath she play'd a Scene Of bloudyer rage. And France that was not long compos'd With civill Drummes againe resounds, And ere the old are fully clos'd Receives new wounds. The great Gustavus in the west Plucks the Imperiall Eagles wing, Than whom the earth did ne're invest A fiercer King: Revenging lost Bohemia, And the proud wrongs which Tilly dud, And tempereth the German clay With Spanish bloud. What should I tell of Polish Bands, And the blouds boyling in the North? Gainst whom the furied Russians Their Troops bring forth. Both confident: This in his purse, And needy valour set on worke; He in his Axe; which oft did worse Th'invading Turke. Who now sustaines a Persian storme: There hell (that made it) suffers schisme. This warre (forsooth) was to reforme Mahumetisme. Onely the Island which wee sowe, (A world without the world) so farre From present wounds, it cannot showe An ancient skarre. White Peace (the beautiful'st of things) Seemes here her everlasting rest To fix, and spreads her downy wings Over the nest. As when great Jove, usurping Reigne, From the plagu'd world did her exile And ty'd her with a golden chaine To one blest Isle: Which in a sea of plenty swamme And Turtles sang on ev'ry bowgh, A safe retreat to all that came As ours is now. Yet wee, as if some foe were here, Leave the despised Fields to clownes, And come to save our selves as 'twere In walled Townes. Hither we bring Wives, Babes, rich clothes And Gemms; Till now my Soveraigne The growing evill doth oppose: Counting in vaine His care preserves us from annoy Of enemyes his Realmes to'invade, Vnlesse hee force us to enjoy The peace hee made. To rowle themselves in envy'd leasure He therefore sends the Landed Heyres, Whilst hee proclaimes not his owne pleasure So much as theirs. The sapp and bloud o'th'land, which fled Into the roote, and choackt the heart, Are bid their quickning pow'r to spread Through ev'ry part. O, 'twas an act, not for my muse To celebrate, nor the dull Age, Vntill the country aire infuse A purer rage! And if the Fields as thankfull prove For benefits receiv'd, as seed, They will, to quite so great a love, A Virgill breed; A Tytirus, that shall not cease Th'Augustus of our world to praise In equall verse, author of peace And Halcyon dayes. Nor let the Gentry grudge to goe Into those places whence they grew, But thinke them blest they may doe so: Who would pursue The smoaky glory of the Towne, That may goe till his native earth, And by the shining fire sit downe Of his owne hearth, Free from the griping Scriveners bands, And the more byting Mercers books; Free from the bayt of oyled hands And painted looks? The country too ev'n chopps for raine: You that exhale it by your power Let the fat dropps fall downe againe In a full showre. And you bright beautyes of the time, That waste your selves here in a blaze, Fixe to your Orbe and proper clime Your wandring rayes. Let no darke corner of the land Be unimbellisht with one Gemme, And those which here too thick doe stand Sprinkle on them. Beleeve me Ladies you will finde In that sweet life, more solid joyes, More true contentment to the minde, Than all Town-toyes. Nor Cupid there lesse bloud doth spill, But heads his shafts with chaster love, Not feathered with a Sparrowes quill But of a Dove. There shall you heare the Nightingale (The harmelesse Syren of the wood) How prettily she tells a tale Of rape and blood. The lyrricke Larke, with all beside Of natures feathered quire: and all The Common-wealth of Flowres in'ts pride Behold you shall. The Lillie (Queene), the (Royall) Rose, The Gillyflowre (Prince of the bloud), The (Courtyer) Tulip (gay in clothes), The (Regall) Budd, The Vilet (purple Senatour), How they doe mock the pompe of State, And all that at the surly doore Of great ones waite. Plant Trees you may, and see them shoote Vp with your Children, to be serv'd To your cleane boards, and the fair'st Fruite To be preserv'd: And learne to use their severall gummes, “'Tis innocence in the sweet blood “Of Cherryes, Apricocks and Plummes “To be imbru'd. The Escuriall A fabricke is the subject of my verse, The best and greatest, but the universe: Whose massy Towers to heaven seem to climbe And scorne the idle battery of old time. How thicke the Courts! How smooth the pavements lye! Of what vast parts what perfect Symmetry! That Phænix Rome, which burnt by barbarous foes, More glorious since out of hir ashes rose, Yet did not, doth not, such a building see, In her youths pryde, or ages Majestie. Spaines King unto St. Laurence vow'd this place When at St. Quintins siedge he did deface The occasion of building this house and dedication of it. The Temple of that Saint, because his foes, After the Towne no longer could oppose, Intrencht them there, whilest vainly they rely On the walls strength, or Philips piety. Who with the Saint besiedged thus did treate; Let it not be prophaneing of thy seate, If with bold Armes ev'n here I wreake my fury, And enemies with holy ruines bury, Thy Altars quencht with blood, for which I sweare Lowd fame shall to the farthest Nations beare The news of an eighth wonder, when in Spaine I raise thee fairer shrines, a prouder Fane. Forthwith conceiv'd hee in his Princely thought Th'Escuriall. From every part are sought They to whom Heaven a rich Idea gave, Or that by art more skill in working have. All therefore whom the distance of the clime Or neighbourhood it selfe (which is oft tyme The greatest barre) at further distance set, In the great labour with joynt forces met. The sallow late-found Indian comes to worke From a new world, from Fesse the captive Turke, The other Indians from the East repaire, All which with mingled Germans chequer'd are And Flemmings white. The Greeke and Dane combine, And Frenchmen with the native Spaniard joyne. The fine Italian there doth emulate Our English joyn'd with Spaine by Mariage late. All tongues are met, yet no confusion there, Because this Pile to Pious end they reare. 'Tis up. And like the Spanish Gerion Hath three proportion'd bodyes joyn'd in one. First there's a Convent for the man whose whole Devotion is above, whose Dove-like soule Seel'd with an Angells quill, hath eyes to finde The way to Heav'n, but to the world is blinde. A Colledge next its faire dimensions spreads, To mould soft clay, and settle tender heads With knowledge and with vertue. What remaines, The Founder for his Royall Court retaynes. One corner holds the King, amidst the rest A Church extends on high its towred crest. Nor was the wise contrivance of the King In ordering his Guift, lesse than the thing; Who gave each part his due, and gravely weigh'd That Saints, Clearks, Worthies, are not one way made. Within the Convent every thing is pure, The Monastery and Church. No Ornament prophane into that doore May presse, nor History but of some Saint Staine the religious wall with blushing paint. There, holy Vestments many a Coffer fill, Rich in the matter, Richer in the skill. (To decke the Spouse) there, Reliques are (to set Hir off with patches) which the King did get From Graves and Ruines. Above all behold The Pictures, there, too numerous to be told, Too precious! And they all are of the blest, And all Christs Acts are lively there exprest. Behold him borne a man, or God exil'd! The pictures there. The Doctours taught their lesson by a Child (His Fathers wisedome)! See the Temple purg'd (The money changers from their tables scourg'd)! Loe there his Miracles successively! Loe here his Supper, there his Agony! Ah! how the bloudy pencell here doth wound His sacred body to the Pillar bound! There Crucifi'd (alas!) he yeilds his breath, And here he triumphs over hell and death. You have him all. And by him (as was meet) The Magdalene that bath'd his blessed feet. How well the Paynter to the life exprest The soft and swelling Ivory of hir brest? Hir flashing Cheekes? Hir long bright haire unroll'd, And spilt upon the ground like molten Gold? But oh, hir teares! and could he paynt them too? (A sinner wisht them his they seem'd so true). Yet what so hard, but art, made proud, assayes? When Heav'n it selfe (whose outward beauties daze Mans feeble eyes, but from whose inward light The Angells with their wings must skreen their sight When in the dreadfull presence they doe stand) Is there decyphered by bold Titians hand? Titians Glory. Where, though it fail'd, yet something Heav'nly takes Our sence, our soule, and love of Heav'n awakes. Such is the Convent. On the other side The Colledge is with Libraries supply'd, The Colledge with the Lybraries. One stor'd with printed bookes, another fraught With Manuscripts from diverse Countreyes brought, But most (which in Arabick letters writ Conteyne the deepest mysteries of wit) From the Turks hands the Christians did gayne. So Mars his spoiles adorne Minerva's Fane. And round their pictures are plac'd properly Pictures there. Whom their great learning from the darke doth free, And that which robs from none his envy'd praise, Posteritie. Here breath—vnto the Palace then proceed. The Kings Palace, with the pictures therein. The invasion of Spain by the Moores. There other Paintings, other objects feed The Honour-starved minde. The horrid wall Showes how the Conquering Moore made spoyle of all. The blacke Troops hide the Field, fear'd when they wore The plumed Caske, but fear'd without it more. In vayne thou fightst Rodrigo with thy fate, Doeing such acts as Mars might imitate. No; when thy Generall to new alarmes Thou drav'st by's Daughters Rape, turning thy armes Against thy selfe, and didst thy Land betray By Royall vice, then, then, thou gav'st away Thy Crowne, which too-late vertue would recall. Yet time shall be (long hence) when Spaine shall fall To her old Lords, hir Lyons nailes grow out, And all her with'red glories freshly sprout. The paynter shifts his scene: as when hee'l make A morne against the night possession take Ore the usurped world, the darkenesse hyes Before the light, Dayes purple Ensigne flyes: The expulsion of the Moors. So may you see, when as the Moores are gone, The Picture dawne, and blacke is us'd alone About the haire, as when (though now 'tis light) Yet on the cloudy hills there hangs some night. Another Chamber at full length display'd The cruell fight before Lepanto made, The battaile of Lepanto. The Gallyes shockt; the Ocean roar'd that day Like a full Lyon blouded with the prey. And all the shoares, and all the billowes round, With noyse of mortalls thunder did resound. From either battaile rose confused cryes, Whilst Eolus such monstrous wracks envyes, And thus the lazie tempests doth upbraid, What Tragedie Act you? or who's afraid At your vaine noyse? you drowne (perhaps) a few Craz'd Barques, condemn'd before to vengeance due, Because some guilty passengers they beare, Or whom ripe Fate oretakes at Sea; But here Whole Navies perish without rockes or shelves, By greater Tempests from the Ships themselves. Thus storm'd hee; whilst uncertaine victory Between both Fleets did long time wav'ring fly. At length upon the Christians Fleet shee stood, Hir wings being clogg'd with water and with blood. This glorious day made the brave Austria seeme Worthy a Crowne, and Englands Martiall Queene. So now the worke is finished, and fit To have the Saint invokt t'inhabite it. Who, loth, approacht. He fear'd that Climates ire And Gridiron-house. The burnt Childe dreads the fire. But glad experience satisfies his doubt: For when the furious Dogg-starre raves throughout The Spanish soyle which smoakes like kindled flaxe, And with the anguish of his byting cracks, Here pleasing horrour through each Limbe doth shoote, Caus'd by the Marble freezing under foote, And the cold springs, and by the wynd which still Breaths freshnesse, panting up the neighbouring hill. Where then was Death wandring about the Earth? (He strangles great foundations in the birth, Anticipating in his best of yeares The busied man, whilst droanes attaine gray haires, And their superfluous life to length is spunne;) Where wert thou envyous Death whilst this was done? Beneath the building is a darksome vault, The Panthea. Which after all th'unwearyed workeman wrought, Then deckt it sumpteous, and a glim'ring light From the rich Jasper breakes the thicker night. It is Deaths Palace, their Kings burying place, Where over Crowned heads he waves his Mace. The hungry Monster waited for this bit, To feasting on a King preferring it, And unto Gen'rall Blacks. But precious Cave (Though dust it selfe grow proud of such a Grave Which brib'd ev'n Fate) yet doe not thou presume To crowd the Founder in a narrow Tombe. Though thou alone mayst all their Kings content, The house is (all) but Philips Monument. On His Majesties Great Shippe lying almost finisht in Woolwich Docke Anno Dom. 1637. and afterwards called The Soveraigne of the Seas Escuriall of the Sea: which art (now growne After long practize, to perfection) Made for hir ages comfort, and doates more On thee alone, than all shee built before. Fairer than all which the rich Billowes keepe From greedy eyes; New wonder of the deepe. For which the French Garoon, Nyles sev'nfold streames, The Spanish Betis, doe envy the Thames. Worthy a better quill thy worth to raise, Worthy that King whom so much Sea obeyes, On whose force only he might rest that plea, For which the Ocean's but a narrow Sea: Which hadst deserv'd (for larger scope and sway) Thy pompous Sayles and streamers to display In Noahs age, when the whole World was mayne, And a lesse Shipp all creatures did conteyne. What Pedegree doth boast thee? From what wood, Whose sacred Oakes so long untoucht had stood, Sprung thy huge Masts? Or was't from more than one? Did Brittish Forrests yeild these Ribbs alone? Or Denmarke or cold Norway bring them forth, Inur'd betimes to tempests of the North, And then at length allow'd to be a Shipp When they had serv'd a stormy Prentizshipp? Then tell me, thou, that seemst a floating Isle, What name dost thou aspire to, what great stile, Which in a few gold letters may comprize All beauty, and presage thee victories? Since thou art so much greater than the Prince Which to thee only sayes; I serve, and since The meaner Charles takes the Kings name in vaine, What canst thou be except The Charlemaigne? Or will thy Royall Master Christen thee The Edgar, to revive his memorie Who so long since ore Land and Ocean raign'd, Scepter and Trident (joyn'd) with sword maintayn'd; Vpon thy gorgeous Beake when I behold That warlike King compleatly arm'd in gold, Whilst at his feet sev'n vassall Kings doe throw Their crowned heads, methinks it must be so. How bright 'mongst neighb'ring Crowns did Brittayn stand When once a yeare hir King Saild round the Land, Which with that wooden wall securer was Than if it had been girdled in with Brasse? And what a brave procession must that be, When to proclaime his Empire ore the Sea, Steering the Galley which those Kings did rowe, To Chester Church in tryumph he did goe? It did both seale his clayme, and represent The image of a perfect Government, Where, sitting at the helme the Monarch steeres, The Oares are labour'd by the active Peeres, And all the People distributed are In other offices of Peace and Warre. Whilst he that in the Common-wealth doth beare No calling, is the Sea-sick passenger. But to our Shipp, for which loud Neptune raves, And seemes to long to daunce hir on his waves. Boyling with love, he sends gale after gale To sigh into hir shrowds his amorous tale. Twice every day into Thames channell runne His watry poasts to know when shee'l be done, And when he may dispatch a full spring-tyde To wedd (as Proxie) his betrothed bryde, And bring hir where from hills of Frost on greene, The Seas looke out to spye their comming Queene. Behold she comes, deckt like a Royall Maide! Hir Anchors are tuckt up, hir Flaggs display'd, Which fann the Ayre, and offer in a scorne Waves to the River, Purple to the Morne. Hir chast white sayle is borne up by the winde, Which, like a nimble Page, wayts close behinde. She mixing hir much beauty with due state, Moves soberly with a Majesticke gate, And ore the christall streame, hir Lord to please, A thousand gracefull gestures practizes. But franticke Thames never so proudly ranne, Did never river pay the Ocean So great a tribute. The old Sea-Gods throng In scaly flocks to wayt on hir along, And froathing a high circuit round about, Their gray curld heads above the waves thrust out. O, welcome to the christall Element! To Neptune alwayes welcome! whether bent To Martiall proofes thou powre on hostile Lands (As from Troyes wooden horse) bright armed Bands, And thund'ring with thy hoarce Artillery Against their Castles like a Castle lye; Or giv'n to softer tryumphs of faire Peace, Thou plant in forreigne soyles the sweet increase Of Englands Royall Roses, when they goe Deaw'd with the Subjects teares to make them grow; Or that with gladder Sayles and fuller pride, Thou fetch for our young Prince a Princely Bride. When running in the Ocean thy last stage, Being then to end thy watry pilgrimage, Let it not be by wracke; nor, feeble growne With yeares, by any foe be overthrowne; (Too proud a victory!) Nor pine away Of slow consumption in inglorious Bay; Nor like patcht Theseus Shipp (whereof the name Of what it was only remayn'd the same) Be mending still, and by that fallacy Affect a perishing eternity; But, lodg'd b'a happy storme upon some spheare, Be launcht a sayling Constellation there. And thence (as Am'rall of the World) hang forth A brighter Starre than that which from the North Lights the benighted Seaman through the Mayne; So Charles his Shipp shall quite Ecclipse his Wayne. A CANTO OF THE Progresse of Learning Tell me O Muse, and tell me Spencers ghost, What may have bred in knowledge such decay Since ancient times, that wee can hardly boast We understand those grounds they then did lay? Much I impute to th'shortning of the day, (Our life, which was a stride, being shrunck t'a spanne) Yet sure there are besides some rubbs i'th'way. Say then how Learnings Sunne to shine began? And by what darke degrees it did goe backe in man? Then thus: when seeds of all things (from the wombe Of pregnant Chaos sprung) were perfected, Another Chaos (yet to be ovrecome) Out of the Reliques of the former bred, With ignorance this infant world orespred, And having drown'd Reasons deviner Ray In the dull lumpe of flesh, made men (the head) Companions of their slaves: The Beasts and they Promiscuously fed, Promiscuously lay. As now they are, things were not sorted then; Nor by division of the parts did breed The publique harmony. For how should men Manure the ground, their minds being choakt with weed? Or adde the last hand, which themselves did need? Woods yet unto the Mountaines did not passe, Nor Heards beneath in grassy Meadowes feed, Nor Corne inrich the middle Grounds; but Grasse, And woods, and stifled Corne, were shuffled in one Masse. When thus sad Nature did her case deplore; Why is the best of Creatures poore whilst I Abound in wealth: or what availes my store Heapt in a common field? O Jove deny Thy fruitlesse gifts, or else cleare reasons eye: And grant that they possesse those gifts alone In whom that Reason most shall fructifie, For till for worth some difference be showne Twixt man and man, twixt man and beast there will be none. Jove heard: Nor chose to blame her murm'ring Pray'r, But remedy the cause, by sending Wit (Which is the use of Reason.) To his Care Th'unpollisht minde of man he did commit, As with a Diamonds point to fashion it, Bidding him gently glyde into his Heart By such convenient meanes as he could get, And that as Soveraigne Lord he should impart Kingdomes and Provinces to them that tooke his part. “A pregnant spirit short instructions serve. So buckling to his taske he did survey All Creatures in this world, and might observe To breake from Womans eye a brighter day Than that which rising Phœbus did display. On this fraile Basis the great worke begun: The lesser World which yet in darkenesse lay, With Weeds and Brambles wildly over-run, To purge that second Chaos found this second Sunne. For whil'st Man gaz'd on the bewitching light, An unknowne Passion entred at his Eye, Which, strugling with his Reason, did exite Her languisht spark through secret sympathy Of flames that were ingendred mutually. His narrow soule grew larger with her Guest, And furnisht to enshrine a Deity: Who now with Language his new love exprest, And now with Thousand Tropes his smoother Language drest. “Love is that fire which wise Prometheus caught “From Heav'n it selfe to forge mans soule anew, “(Which Feavours with it, and dead Palenesse brought “Instead of Health, Repose, and Lively Hiew). “When all these goods out of the Basket flew, “Hope only to the bottome did remove. “Yet had wee rather this sweet Hope pursue “Than have our former State. And some approve “With Losse of all those goods even a hopelesse Love. Say you by whom this kindly flame's reprov'd, Who layd the first stone of civilitie? Whilst men sought sweet converse with them they lov'd, And for advice in the New Malady, With others too; which let in Amitie? Who did the Organs first for Reason fit, As by experience to this day wee see? “For properly Love ripens the Fooles wit; “But turnes some wise men Fooles by over rip'ning it. Men thus conversing, soone the Arts were made, And, that which all included, Poetry: Under whose veyle were mystickly convey'd The solid Grounds of all Phylosophy, Ev'n to the homely Rules of Husbandry, Which with such sugred Eloquence were drest, And Coucht in such Delightfull Harmony, That they who could not crabbed Texts disgest, To heare those flowing numbers, without number prest. And now had Wit his noble taske perform'd; For what could more for Mortalls be desir'd Than to be decently susteyn'd, and form'd With all the Ornaments their minds requir'd! So to his Contemplations he retir'd, Leaving the Countryes in propriety To such as were by him for Rule inspir'd, Who us'd them with a Liberality That little differ'd from the old community. But Nature was not so content, whose thought Is vast and ever Covetous of more: For though to such a rare perfection brought, She held all nothing that was done before. And therefore farther to improve her store, Her wily head a counterfeit did frame, Who in his lookes Wits perfect likenesse bore, And by that stollen tytle dar'd to clayme The Government of things. But Craft was his right name. So well could he his subtile picklocks file That in most minds his entrance he had made, Partly deceiv'd with his pretended style, And partly from their due Allegiance swayd With Guifts of a strange force before them layd, Which in the Oceans unknowne waves did lye, (Now Sayl'd and div'd into) which Earth display'd Forc't by a thousand tortures to discry Where her bright Gold was hid from Phœbus's envyous eye. His precepts are; From every thing to get: And each from other. But with legall show. (For that, he sayth, is liveing by his wit.) But the true Wit which all these things did owe, From his just right he wrongfully did throw. That only Title hath a solid Plea Which he confirmes, if he did not bestow. He is Lord Paramount of Land and Sea, And all the world is held of Craft in Capite. O Witt! next Jove Creator of Mankind, Where dost thou now in secret corner sit, Counting the Starrs with avaricious mind Or brooding some immortall worke of wit Whereby thou maist affected glory get, Whilst thy poore Clients, outed of their right, For nobler Sciences are made unfit, “Since Lamps that have no Oyle can give no light, “And folly twere to shine when men have lost their sight? Thus some: who well affected did remaine, To the old learned Age. Yet each of these Had learn't a Craft his livelyhood to gaine; And learnt withall the Liberall Sciences, Forc't to give halfe obedience for his ease To the new Government. But if his soule (Not needing the dull world) her selfe might please, She then would passe directly to her Gole, And spurne the Golden Apples that before her rowle. These Cryes fetcht Wit from the retyred shade Of a delightfull Solitary Grove; Who (wondring) saw what spoil his Foe had made Of the most precious goods. He cry'd to Jove, On Nature cry'd, that could such Change approve. Then learnt he first to be Satyricall, (Whose bitter'st Argument before was Love) And let some words of hard Construction fall, And ev'ry drop of inke was mingled with some Gall. At last demands the Law. And he will try By publique Justice before Natures Barre To whom the World perteynes most rightfully. Craft, (though possession were his surer farre) His Plea of merit would not seeme to marre, But nam'd a day his Title to abet; On it the Creatures all assembled are, Raunged by Natures Marshall as they met, And all on the Successe their expectation set. First Wit with copious Language did dilate Those benefits which Man to him did owe, Whom from a poore dishonourable state, He made with blessings of all sorts to flow. He said, whom he made Rulers first did know To rule themselves. And if the World new Clad With a few glitt'ring Trifles, (but for show) Which Craft with dammage of true Goods did adde, Seem'd now to have more wealth, it then more honor had. Here ceas'd his speech. Then Craft reply'd to all With Such a boldnesse as not blusht to slight Th'immortall workes of Wit, which he did call Chymera's of the Fancy, vaine and light, And urg'd the Learned had renounc't their right In Earthly things, as he could represent By diverse Instruments themselves did write, Knowing they were unfit for Government, As wholly unto idle Contemplations bent. But that they did not truely Gold contemne (Which all that have their Eyes must needs admire), Only in boasting writings did Condemne The thing which in their hearts they most desire. Nor could the World his perfect State acquire, Whilst not a Mettall was in Earth supprest But a Fifth Element more bright than fire, Which Poets ev'n denying had confest, Styling the Golden Age what they would have The best. That he found out; And Gemms of wond'rous price Like which their Mistresse Eyes, Teeth, Lipps, they feign, As things which have most vertue to entice. And last, said he; 'Tis hamm'ring in this brayne To turne all things I touch to golden veyne. The Philosophers Stone. This clos'd his speech; But left such stings behind In Nature, biteing greedily at gaine, That (seeming first to poyse it in her minde) She judg'd the World to Craft, which Wisedome she defin'd. Her overpartiall Doome, she colour'd ore With this pretext, that the worlds Rule (now growne More intricate through its increased store) Requir'd a Drudge to tend that worke alone, But Wit had many things to study on. Then ended with a smooth-fac'd Complement, How Him she held in high opinion, Whom breaking up the Court, she from her sent As infinitly prais'd, as not a jot content. For his stout heart felt deepe disgraces wound, And hardly could dissemble Injury, Who, having long survey'd the Creatures round, Leapt lightly on an Eagle perching by, And Cry'd; The Earth to me she may deny, But not the Heav'n. So, without making playne, Directs his Flight to fair Eternity. (The Muses horse his nimble joynts doth strayne When he is spurr'd with Love, or nettled with disdaine.) His active Circles Crowne Sols glorious Spheare: Heav'n op'ning still new Beauties to his Eye As he gets up, whilst Earth doth lesse appeare, Where some presage his fall to Poverty, The heighth will turne his braine, some others cry; Some few in judging Eares his raptures poise, (Who like a Larke doth singing mount the Skyes). They beare him up with their applausive noise, At which in secret heart he not a little joyes. But the faint Bird is not releeved so Although her Rider cheer'd her what he might, To whom the whole Terrestriall Globe below Seem'd a meane Quarry to debase his flight, Yet forc't ere long for a small bait to light, The hunger of his Animall to stay, Though oft he cuffs it first, and oft doth slight. But need Commands, and Flesh must needs obay, So at the last he stoops and seazes the skorn'd prey. As in a Torch wee see the bating flame Unto its heav'nly country doth aspire, But the wax softly shrinking from the same Makes it for food from Heaven to retire, And tend to Earthward with descending fire: So Wit is forc't (some Maintenance to get) To stoop to Earth against his owne desire; But soone againe the fruitfull Earth doth quit, To soare in Empty Ayre: (Heav'n send me better wit!) Yet when this Eagle shall have cast her Bill, And mew'd her mortall plumes, some thinke that he Shall then attaine the topp of Heavens hill, And Coeternall with his writings be, Taking peculiar felicitie In penning Hymnes of His Creators praise; (That is the genuine use of Poetry) And for reward of those Cœlestiall Layes That hov'ring Cherubins shall Crowne him with fresh Bayes. ?Non est mortale quod optas Cum sis mortalis.? The Ruby Hayle! whom the Diamonds proclayme their King; Crowning as Peeres, as Guards envyroning; Hayle! whom the rising Sunne where thou wert borne, Invested in the purple of the Morne, And his owne Beames; whilst thee my verse displayes Thou swell'st at once, and blushest at thy praise. Like a red Sea thy trembling Mount of blood Stands off i'th'ayre and threats a Crimson flood Over the Golden bancks, whilst our dimm'd sight Mistakes for flowing waves thy floating light. Or as in Wine the subtile spirits move, Making ev'n Temperance her selfe in love; So rowles thy fiery and bewitching Eye, Able to shake a vow of Poverty. But oh, how like my Cruell faire thou art? Thy panting stone is her obdurate heart Pegg'd in with Diamonds: or signifies Her Lipp, severely guarded by her Eyes. A Friends Wedding This day my friend is ty'de With pleasing Chaines to a sweet Bryde. So well the Turtle Loves, So well are coupled Venus Doves; Which her blythe Sonne hath broake With rods of Mirtle to her yoake. Out of thy Lazy bed, Get up my Muse, and lay thy head With thy faire Friend the Morne, This happy Marriage to adorne. Why art thou yet so dull When thou shouldst quaffe Castalia full To th'health of the faire BRIDE; In which her LOVERS is implyde. Nor yet? Then fetch the Sack; Ile put thee to the gentle wrack. Finde me a way to show What happinesse I wish these two. Of PORCIAS Love relate, How constant she was to her Mate, And hearing Brutus death, By stopping it expir'd her breath: And then of ORPHEUS tell, And of a Husband that lov'd well; Through Heav'n, hell, Earth and Sea He cryd his lost Euridice, That the Rocks groan'd againe, Helping the Widdower to complaine, And hell it selfe lamented, And fates their cruelty repented. Then wish this couple here May prove as faithfull as they were, But never their fate prove, And only imitate their Love. Not yet? Is this a day For silence? Or doth silence say “Deepe streames runne without noise, “And those that sound are hollow Joyes? Sonnets translated out of Spanish A Rich Foole Thee, senselesse Stock, because th'art richly guilt, The blinded people without cause admire, And Superstition impiously hath built Altars to that which should have beene the fire. Nere shall my tongue consent to worship thee, Since all's not Gold that glisters and is faire; Carving but makes an Image of a Tree: But Gods of Images are made by Prayer. Sabean Incense in a fragrant Cloud Illustriously suspended ore thy Crowne Like a Kings Canopy, makes thee allowd For more than man. But let them take thee downe, And thy true value be once understood, Thy dull Idolaters will finde th'art wood. Hope To hope is good, but with such wild applause Each promise Fabius thou dost entertain; As if decreed thee by Fates certaine Lawes, Or in possession now it did remaine. Wisdome is arm'd 'gainst all that can succeed, Tymes changes and his stratagems: For such His nature is, that when his wings wee need He will come creeping on his halting Crutch. Doe not, if wise, then to thy selfe assure The future, nor on present goods rely, Or thinke there's any time from time secure: For then when Patience sees her Harvest nigh, That mocking Tyrant in an instant reares A wall between the Sicle and the Eares. Constancie Cloris i'th' Sunne proyning her Locks did sit With Lilly hand and Combe of Ivorie, But scarce could you discerne the Combe in it, Nor see the Sunne, Ecclips'd when those were by. Whilst the rich fleece about her Shoulders playes, And the pure Brooke (whose Margent is her bed) Sucks from her two bright Sunnes delitious rayes Through Clouds of Gold with which they're shadowed; Thus Coridon (chiding the flying howres, With such a voyce as made them faster fly) Invoakt the Pow'r which doth subdue all Pow'rs: In vayne (O Love) is my Felicitie, If the sweet Flames, thy feathered shafts beganne To Kindle, thy wings feathers doe not fanne! The Fall The bloudy trunck of him who did possesse Above the rest a haplesse happy state, This little Stone doth Seale, but not depresse, And scarce can stop the rowling of his fate. Brasse Tombes which justice hath deny'd t'his fault, The common pity to his vertues payes, Adorning an Imaginary vault, Which from our minds time strives in vaine to raze. Ten yeares the world upon him falsly smild, Sheathing in fawning lookes the deadly knife Long aymed at his head; That so beguild It more securely might bereave his Life; Then threw him to a Scaffold from a Throne, Much Doctrine lyes under this little Stone. A Rose Blowne in the Morning, thou shalt fade ere Noone: What bootes a Life which in such hast forsakes thee? Th'art wondrous frolick being to dye so soone: And passing proud a little colour makes thee. If thee thy brittle beauty so deceives, Know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane; For the same beauty doth in bloody leaves The sentence of thy early death containe. Some Clownes course Lungs will poyson thy sweet flow'r If by the carelesse Plough thou shalt be torne: And many Herods lye in waite each how'r To murther thee as soone as thou art borne; Nay, force thy Bud to blow; Their Tyrant breath Anticipating Life, to hasten death. A Picture Behold how Marius from Minturnian Lake Flying through Africk late by him orethrowne, A pittyfull Comparison doth make Betweene high Carthage ruines and his owne! Thy Prides just fall which thou must one day mourne, In this dumbe Picture Cælia thou hast read, For so doth Age, Loves Empire too oreturn, And pull downe Thrones in hearts established. Thy glasse, where oft thou whetst each wounding grace, Will shew thee better farre the History Of Marius, and raz'd Carthage, in thy face: And thou, one Trophy of Times victory, Shalt then confesse, to equall skornes expos'd, Thy Beauty was a Tyrant soone depos'd. A River Thou clearer honour of the Christall Mayne, Sweet Rivulet, compos'd of liquid plate, Whose waters glide through this enamell'd plaine With sound harmonious, with stately gate; Since shee is standing on thy happy brimme Who both enflameth and congeales my blood, Whilst Love with admirable skill doth limme Her portraict on thy smooth and quiet flood; Move on thus Gently still, and doe not slacke The waving reynes unto the foaming bit With which thou now art pleased to pull backe Thy headstrong Current: For it is not fit Neptune with all the treasures he doth hold Should so much beauty in his Armes infold. A Nightingale With such variety and dainty skill Yon'd Nightingale devides her mournefull song, As if tenne thousand of them through one bill Did sing in parts the story of their wrong. Nay, shee accuses with such vehemence Her Ravisher, I thinke she would incline The conscious Grove thereof to have a sence And print it on the Leaves of that tall Pine. Yet happy shee, who may her paine declare In moving Noates, and wand'ring through the woods With uncut wings, by change divert her care! But let Him melt away in silent floods, Whom his Medusa turn'd into a stone, That he might neither change, nor make his moane. A Cupid of Diamonds Presented Banisht from Life to seeke out death I goe, Which through the world so long I will pursue, Till desp'rat Griefe at least have made men know My Soule feares no divorcement but from you. To thinke to mollifie you now were vaine, For if my present services could not Worke the least feeling in your cold disdaine, What should I hope for absent and forgot? Yet take this Gemme, which, as my melting Eye My soft affection did at parting prove, May Cipher to you now my Constancie. Wear't in your bosome, tis the God of Love. And once I'le try, if (as in Goldsmiths Art) A Diamond Love can cut a Diamond Heart. The Spring Those whiter Lillies which the early Morne Seemes to have newly woven of sleav'd Silke, To which (on Banks of wealthy Tagus borne) Gold was their Cradle, liquid Pearle their Milke: These blushing Roses, with whose virgin leaves The wanton Wind to sport himselfe presumes, Whilst from their rifled wardrobe he receives For his wings Purple, for his breath Perfumes: Both those, and these, my Cælia's pretty foote Trod-up. But if she should her Face display, And fragrant breast, they'd dry againe to th'Roote, (As with the blasting of the Mid-dayes ray) And this soft wind which both perfumes and Cooles Passe like the unregarded breath of Fooles. The Fourth Booke OF VIRGILLS ÆNEIS On the Loves of DIDO and ÆNEAS The Argument of the three preceding Bookes, By way of Introduction Æneas bound for Italie, is tost By raging Seas to Lybia's guarded Coast, Where Dido builds faire Carthage with that wealth She with her selfe conveigh'd from Tyre by stealth; For which Pigmalion her deare Husband slew, And for the same sought her destruction too. Pious Æneas, and his valiant Trayne, The Royall Widdow there doth entertaine. Who, though grasse growes where Conquerd Troy had stood, Makes it her Pride to come of Trojan blood. Yet thoughtfull Venus, who the punick Faith And Rivall-Walls in great suspition hath, Fearing a change from Interest of State, Or some new Plot from Juno's ancient hate To those of Troy, which made her raise that storme: Sends Cupid, maskt in young Ascanius forme, To ceaze the Fortresse Royall (the Queene's Brest) And make Her first a prisoner to her Guest. Shee with a hundred questions streight began Of Troy: Then askes the story of the Man From first to last. Hee paynts his Town's sad fall (Besieg'd ten yeares): his owne flight (last of all), On his broad shoulders bearing through the Fire His vanquisht Gods, and his decrepid Sire: His poore Wife tripping after, and his Boy With shorter steps (the growing Hope of Troy): Shee mist; how backe amongst the Swords he flyes, And in the Flames his lost Creusa cryes: Not found; resum'd his venerable Load With heavier Cheere, and forward (weeping) trod. Then tells his sev'n-yeares Travailes; in which Hee Was tost no lesse upon the Land than Sea: Meeting his greedy Auditors. But how It wrought with Dido this next Booke will show. The Fourth Booke OF VIRGILLS ÆNEIS On the Loves of DIDO and ÆNEAS But she who Love long since had swallowed downe, Melts with hid fire; her wound doth inward weep: The Mans much worth, his Nations much Renowne Runs in her minde: His Lookes and words are deepe Fixt in her breast: Care weanes her Eies from sleepe; The Morne with Phœbus lampe the Earth survayd, And drew Heav'ns veyle through which moist Starrs did creep; When thus to her deare sister (sicke) she said, Anna what frightfull Dreames my wavering soule invade! Who is this Man that visits our Aboads? How wise! How valiant! What a Face he has! Well may hee be descended from the Gods. Feare shewes ignoble minds: But hee (alas) Tost with what Fates! through what warres did he passe! Were I not well resolv'd never to wed Since my first Love by death bereft me was: Did I not loath the Nuptiall Torch and Bed, To this one fault perchance, perchance I might be led. For since my poore Sicheus's fatall howre (Our houshold Gods besmear'd by brothers steele) This only Man (I must confesse) had powre To shake my constant Faith, and make it reele: The footsteps of that ancient flame I feele. But first Earth swallow me, or (Thunder-slaine) Jove naile me to the shades, pale shades of Hell, And everlasting Night, before I staine Thee (holy Chastitie) or thy faire Rites profane. Hee tooke my love with him (and let him keep't Cold in his Grave) to whom I first was tyde. This said, her bosom full of Teares she wept. O dearer than my life! (Anna replyde) Wilt thou forever live a dead mans Bride? Nor prety Babes (Rewards of Venus) know? Are Ghosts apeas'd, or Ashes satisfide With this think'st thou? What if before (thy woe Yet greene and fresh) no husbands downe with thee would goe? Not Lybia's King (Iarbas) skornd in Tyre Before, with other Chiefs whom Affrick high In Mettle, breeds? Wilt thou quench Loves sweet fire? Nor yet consider whom thou'rt planted nigh? Here (a fierce People) the Getulians lye, Bitlesse Numidian Horse, and Quicksands dire, There mad Barceans block thee up, and drye Deserts. What speake I of the bloodier ire A Wolfe turn'd Brother breaths, and gathering Clouds from Tyre? Auspicious Heav'ns, and Juno's care of thee, The Trojan Navie hither (doubtlesse) led. O (sister) what a Citie will this be! How shalt thou see thy Scepter flourish! wed To Troy, how will the Punick Glory spread! Aske but Heav'ns leave, thy Guest then (feasting) keepe, Pretending 'tis unsafe to saile in winter, When Ships are tost, and Pleiades doe weepe, And ominous Skyes forbid, On Seas to venter. These words, blew Love t'a flame; for doubts hope lent her, And stauncht her blushes. First in solemne wise To Phœbus, Bacchus, Ceres (Lawes-Inventer) Selected Lambs i'th'Fane they Sacrifize, But Juno most atone who favours Nuptiall tyes. The Queene her selfe (more beautious in those Rites) Betweene the Crescent of a milke white Cow The liquor powres: Or passing in their sights, Unto the Gods with rev'rend grace doth bow, Consults the panting lites, and payes her vow. Alas, vayne Mysteries! Blind Priests aread, Which is the sacrifize is offer'd now? Soft flames upon the Off'rers marrow feed, And her concealed wound doth freshly inward bleed. Poore Dido burnes, and stung with restlesse Love Runs raveing to and fro through every street, Runs like a Hinde, which in some covert grove Where she securely graz'd in fruitfull Creet, A woodman shooting at farre distance hit; Drunke in her veynes the feather'd Iron lyes, Nor he who made the wound doth know of it; She through Dictean woods and pastures highs, But carries in her side the Arrow which she flyes. Shee takes Æneas with her up and downe, And shews him the vast wealth she brought from Tyre, The goodly streets and Bulwarkes of her Towne. No lesse a thousand times did she desire To shew unto him too her am'rous fire; And oft began, but shame represt her tongue. At night unto their banquets they retyre; And Troy's sad fall againe she must have sung, And at his charming Lips againe shee fondly hung. When every one was parted to his rest, And the dimme Moone trod on the heeles of day, And setting Starres shew'd it high time to rest, She in the empty house languisht away, And on the Couch, which he had pressed, lay: Absent she sees him whom her thoughts admire, Him absent heares, or on her lappe doth stay Ascanius the true picture of his sire, As if she so could cheat her impotent desire. All workes are at a stand; The youth for warre Provide no Forts, nor trayning exercise; Huge beames, and arches, which halfe finisht are, Hang doubtfull in the Ayre, to fall, or rise, And Tow'rs doe threat at once both Earth and Skyes. Whom when as Joves deare wife perceiv'd so drown'd In witchcrafts, and that Fame, with lowdest cryes, Could not awake her from the pleasing swound, She thus accosted Venus, and her minde did sound. Great glory sure, and goodly spoyles yee gaine, You and your Boy: A doughty enterprize Yee have atchiev'd, and worthy to remaine In lasting Marble, if two Deityes By subtlety one woman doe surprize. Nor am I ignorant that, to defend Your Race from feare of future Enemies, Y'are jealous of my walls. But to what end Should so neare friends as wee eternally contend? Nay rather let us knit eternall Love, And bind the Peace more strong with Hymens cord. Yee have the thing for which so much ye strove, Eliza with Loves fi'ry shaft is gor'd. Then rule we this joynt Towne with one accord, And who shall ayd it most be now our strife. Once let a Queen obey a Trojan Lord, And Tyrians (to preserve a Lovers life) Call thee their Patronesse, as Dowry of his wife. Venus (who saw her drift was to translate To Carthaginians those Imperiall dues Which were reserv'd for Italy by Fate) Made this Reply. Who madly would refuse So advantagious match, and rather choose To war with you? If but the faire Event According to your wise forecast ensues. But Fates, I feare me, nor Jove will consent That Tyrians and Trojans in one Towne be pent. And yet perchance you, lying in his breast, With a wives Rhet'rick may his Councells sway; Then breake the Ice; I'l second the Request. Leave that to me (said shee) and for a way T'effect our wishes, marke my plot I pray. To-morrow, when the Sun shall be discryde To guild the Mountaines with his early'st ray, Æneas and the Love-sick Queene provide To have a solemne hunting in the Forrest wide. Now I, when here they beat the Coppice, there The Horsemen flutter, on their heads will powre A pitchy cloud, and Heav'n with Thunder teare. Their followers for shelter from the showre By severall paths along the plaine shall skowre; Maskt in darke night, unto one Cave they two Shall come. There I will be; and (adde your pow'r,) Tye such a knot as only Fates undoe; I'l seale her his. Good Hymen shall be present too. Venus seemes, nodding, to consent; and smiles To see Dame Juno's craft. Meane while the Morne Arose: And the choice youth, with subtle toyles, Sharpe hunting-speares, fleet steeds in Barb'ry borne, And sure-nos'd hounds tun'd to the Bugle-horne, Are gone before. The Lords at doore expect Whilst the Queene staies within her selfe t'adorne. Her Palfrey stands with Gold and Skarlet deckt, And champs the foaming Bit, as skorning to be checkt. At length she comes, with a huge troope: Her Gowne Of Tyrian dye, bordred with Flow'rs of Gold: A Quiver by her comely side hung downe; Gold Ribining her brighter haire enrolld, Gold Buttons did her purple vesture hold. The Trojans too, and blithe Iulus went Above the rest, farre goodlyest to behold, Æneas selfe his gladding presence lent, And with his darkned trayne did Dido's trayne augment. As when Apollo leaves his winter seates Of Lycia and Zanthus floods, to see His Country Delos, and his feast repeats; About his Altars hum confusedly Creets, Dryopes, and ruddy Nymphs: But hee On Cynthus rides, and pleating doth enlace His flowing haire with Gold, and his lov'd tree: His shafts shogge at his backe. With no lesse grace Æneas marcht. Such rayes displayd his Lovely face. When in the Mountaines now engag'd they were And pathlesse woods, loe Goats from summits cast Runne tumbling through the bushes: Heardes of Deere Another way come hurrying downe as fast, And raise a cloud as through the dust they hast. Hot-spurre Iulus on his mettl'd horse Out-cracking all, now these, now those men past, And wisht, 'mongst those faint Beasts, &amp; without force, Some Lyon, or tusk't Bore, would crosse him in his course. Meane while loud Thunder Heav'ns Pavilion teares, Making a passage for th'ensuing raine: The Trojan youth, and Tyrian followers, And Venus Dardan-Grandchild through the Plaine Seeke sev'rall shelters: Rivers, like a Mayne, Rush from the Mountaines round. One Cave that Lord Of Troy, and she who did in Carthage raigne, Lighted upon. Earth gives the signall word, And Juno, Queene of Marriage, doth their hands accord. The guilty Heav'ns, as blushing to have been An instrument this meeting to fulfill, With flashing lightning shone: The Nymphs were seen To weepe with all their streames, and from each hill Were heard to murmur the presaged Ill. That day did usher Death, and Didos shame: For now shees arm'd, let men say what they will, Nor seekes, as erst, to hide her am'rous flame: She calls it Wedlock, gives her fault an honest name. Fame straight through Lybias goodly towns doth post, Fame a fleet evill, which none can outflye; Most strong she is when she hath travaild most, First small through feare, but growne so instantly, That standing on the ground shee'l reach the Skye. She was the last birth Mother Earth did bring When her proud anger did the Gods defie, The Gyants sister, swift of foot and wing; A huger never was, nor a more monstrous thing. Most strange! Theres not a Plume her body beares But under it a watching Eye doth peepe, As many tatling tongues, and listning Eares. By night 'tween Earth and Heaven shee doth sweepe Skreeching, nor shuts her Lids with balmy sleepe. And all the day time upon Castle-gates Or steeple-tops she doth strict watches keepe, And frights great Cyties with her sudden Bates, And with one confidence both truths and lyes relates. She, glad of such a Prey whereon to plume, Through peoples mindes truths mixt with falshood sent: How one Æneas came from Troy, with whom Fayre Dido deign'd to wed; And now they spent In Revells the long winter, wholly bent On brutish Love, drowning affaires of State: These things she sow'd in mens rank mouths: then went To King Iarbas, and did irritate His minde with tales, and his old wrath exasperate. A hundred Temples built to Jove had hee, (Whome unto Hammon forct Gramantis bore) A hundred Altars burning constantly (The Gods æternall Centinells) each floore Painted with bloud of beasts, with flow'rs each doore, Who mad with Love, and with the bitter newes, Before the Altars, and the Gods before, Kneeling, with hands upheav'd to Jove, doth use Great supplications and in this manner sues. Jove, to whom Moores rich wine on Carpets drinke, Seest this? Or when thy arme doth lightning shake, Giv'st thou false fire t'a cloud to make fooles winke? And, when it thunders, dost thou only make A rumbling ore our heads at which wee quake? A stray, to whom our selfe (being hither fled) Hir'd a small barren plot, for pity sake, With some restraints, refusd with us to wed, And Don Æneas takes unto her Crowne and bed. And now this Paris, with a quoife to stay His Beard and powderd Locks, and's beaten trayne Of shee-men, gluts himselfe upon the prey; Whilst we with guifts on guifts enrich thy Fane, And make our person glorious in vaine. Th'al-pow'rfull heard these pray'rs; And cast his Eye, On the new walls where th'am'rous paire remaine Carelesse how desp'rate sicke their fame doth lye, Then spake, and gave this charge to winged Mercury. Goe Sonne, as swift as windes, in Carthage light. Tell Venus sonne, whom loytring there thou'lt see Unworthy of that Fate which he doth slight, That his faire Mother painted him to mee Another man; And therefore twice did free From Græcian swords; One, who with steddy rayn Should mannage proud and warlike Italie, And prove himselfe of Teucers haughty strayne, And the tryumphed World under his Lawes maintaine. If not at all this him with glory fires, Nor care of his owne greatnesse he doth show, Why should he grudge his sonne the Roman spires? What makes he here? What seekes he from a Foe? Latium, and them who there expect to grow From him, let him regard. Let him away. This is th'effect, from me this let him know. At once Jove ended, and the sonne of Maye His greater sires commands prepar'd himselfe t'obey. First Golden Wings unto his feete he binds, Which over Lands and over Seas that swell Beare him aloft, as speedy as the Winds. Then takes his rod. With this he calls from hell Pale Ghosts, sends others in sad shades to dwell, Gives sleepe and takes it from the drowzie brayne, And seales up eyes with death. He doth repell By pow'r of this the Heav'ns which part in twaine, And through the watry Clouds he sayls as through a Main. He soaring the lanke sides and Crowne disclos'd Of craggy Atlas, whose necke props the Sky, Atlas, whose Piney head to stormes expos'd Is bound about with Clouds continually. Thick on his aged backe the snow doth lye, And down his dravell'd chinne powre plenteous springs, His beard in Icycles growes horridly. Here lights the god poysd on his hov'ring wings, Towards the Sea from hence his body headlong flings. Like to a Bird, which round the Shores doth glide And Fishy Rocks, skimming along the Bay; So flyes 'tweene Earth and Heav'n, and doth divide The Winde and Sandy Coast of Lybia, Leaving his Mothers sire, the sonne of May. Who Landing where the Sheep-coates lately were, Sees how Æneas doth the workes survey, Here building Tow'rs, and altring Turrets there, He by his side a sword all Stard with Gemmes did weare. Upon his shoulder to the Ayre displayd A Robe of Tyrian Purple seem'd to flame, Which Dido with her owne faire hands had made And edgd the seams with gold. Here you doe frame, (Said Hermes) hindring your owne Crowne and Fame, High Tow'rs of Carthage, and, uxorious, rayse Faire Walls whereof another beares the name: Marke now what Jove himselfe, whom Heav'n obaies And Earth, by his wing'd messenger unto you saies. What make you here loytring in Lybia? If glory of great actions fire not you, Nor your owne Interest nor Fame you weigh; Seeke your Heires good, Iulus hopes pursue, To whom the Latian Crowne and Rome is due. This having said Cyllenius vanisht quite From mortall eyes, and back to Heaven flew. Æneas at the vision shakes with fright, His tongue cleaves to his jawes, his hair stands bolt-upright. Hee is on fire to goe, and flye that Land Of sweet inchantments, being skar'd away By no lesse warning than the Gods command. But (ah?) what shall he doe? How dare t'assay With words the am'rous Queene? What should hee say For introduction? His swift-beating thought In doubtfull ballance thousand things did lay, And this way cast them, and then that way wrought, At last this seemd the best when all wayes he had sought. He cald Sergestus, Mnesteus, and the stout Cloanthus, bids them fit immediatly The Fleet, and draw their Companies about The Port, their armes prepar'd, not telling why; Meane while himselfe (when no least jealousie To the good Queene should thought of breach betray In so great Loves) an entrance would espye, The season of soft speech, and dextrous way. With readinesse and joy they doe him all obay. But Dido found their plot. (Whats hid from Lovers?) Herselfe, who doubts ev'n safe things, first doth see't: And the same tatling Fame to her discovers That Trojans are departing with their Fleete. Shees mad, stark mad, and runs through ev'ry street Like Bacchus She-Priests, when the god is in, And they to doe him furious homage meete, Citheron yelling with their mid-night dynne. Then thus t'Æneas speakes, nor stayes till he beginne. Didst thou hope too by stealth to leave my land, And that such treason could be unbetray'd? Nor should my Love, nor thy late plighted hand, Nor Dido, who would dye, thy flight have staid? Must too this Voyage be in Winter made? Through stormes? O, cruell to thy selfe, and mee! Didst thou not hunt strange Lands, and Scepters swayd By others, if old Troy reviv'd should be, Should Troy it selfe be sought through a tempest'ous Sea? Mee fly'st thou? By these teares, and thy right hand, (Since this is all's now left to wretched me) By marriages New joyes, and sacred Band, If ought I did could meritorious be, If ever ought of mine were sweet to thee; Pity our house, which must with my decay Give early period to its soveraignty; And put, I doe beseech thee, farre away This cruell minde, If cruell mindes heare them that pray. For thee the Lybian Nations me defie, The Kings of Scythia hate me, and my Tyre: For thee I lost my shame, and that, whereby Alone I might unto the Starres aspire, The chaster fame which I did once acquire. To whom, my Guest (for Husband's out of date), Dost thou commit me ready to expire? Why stay I? Till Pigmaleon waste my state? Or on Iarbas wheeles, a captive Queene, to wayte? Yet if before thou fled'st out of this place Some childe at least I unto thee had borne, If in my Court, resembling but thy face, Some young Æneas playd; I should not mourne As one so quite deluded, or forelorne. Here ceased shee. But hee, whom Jove had ty'd With strict commands, his Eyes did no way turne, But stoutly did his griefe suppresse, and hide Under his secret heart. Then thus in short replyde, For me, O Queene, I never will deny But that I owe you more than you can say, Nor shall I sticke to beare in memory Eliza's name, whilst memorie doth stay In this frayle seate, whilst breath these limbs doth sway. But to the point. I never did intend (Pray charge me not with that) to steale away: And much lesse did I Wedlock-bands pretend, Neither to such a treaty ever condescend. Would Fates permit me mine owne way to take, And please my selfe in choosing of a Land, Ilium out of her ashes I would rake, And gleane my Earths sweet Reliques, Troy should stand, (The vanquisht Troops replanted, by my hand) And Priam's Tow'rs againe to Heav'n aspire. But now have I the Oracles command To seeke great Italy; the same require The Destinies. My Country's this; This my desire. If you of Tyre with Carthage Tow'rs are tooke, Why should our seeking Latian fields offend? May not the Trojans too new mansions looke? As oft as night moyst shadowes doth extend Over the Earth, and golden Stars ascend, My Fathers chyding ghost affrights my sleepe: My sonne, on whom that Realme is to descend, And those deare Eyes doe freshly seeme to weepe; Complaining that from him his destin'd Crowne I keepe. And now Joves Sonne (by both their heads I sweare) Was sent to me, my selfe the God did see In open day, and with these Eares did heare: Then vexe not with complaints your selfe and mee, I goe against my will to Italy. Whilst thus he spake, shee lookt at him askew, Rowling her lightning Eyes continually, And him from head to foot did silent view, When, being throughly heat, these thundring words ensue. Nor Goddesse was thy Mother, nor the source Of thy high blood renowned Dardanus, But some Hyrcanian Tigresse was thy Nource, Out of the stony Loynes of Caucasus Descended, cruell and perfidious. For with what hopes should I thy faults yet cover, Did my teares make thee sigh? Or bend, but thus, Thine Eyes? Or sadnesse for my griefe discover? Or if thou couldst not Love, to pity yet a Lover? Whom first accuse I since these Loves began? Jove is unjust, Juno her charge gives or'e, Whom may a Woman trust? I tooke this man Homelesse, a desp'rate wrack upon my shoare, And fondly gave him halfe the Crowne I wore: His Ships rebuilt, t'his men new lives I lent. And now the Fates, the Oracles, what more? (It makes me mad) Joves sonne on purpose sent Brings him forsooth a menace through the Firmament. As if the Gods their blissefull rest did breake With thinking on thy Voyages. But I Nor stop you, nor confute the words you speake. Goe, chase on Rowling billowes Realmes that fly, With ficle windes uncertaine Italy. Some courteous Rock (if Heav'n just curses heare) Will be Revenger of my injury: When thou perceiving the sad Fate draw neere, Shalt Dido, Dido, call; who surely will be there. For when cold death shall part with dreary swoone My Soule and Flesh; my ghost, where ere thou bee, Shall haunt thee with dim Torch, and light thee downe To thy darke conscience: I'l be Hell to thee, And this glad newes will make Hell Heav'n to mee. Here, falling as farre from him as she might, She fainted ere her speech were finished: Leaving him tossing in his tender spright What he should say to her, or leave unsed, Her Maides conveigh her to her Iv'ry Bed. But good Æneas, though he faine would prove To swage her griefe, and leave her comforted, Peirc't to the soul with her so ardent Love, Yet goes to view his Fleet, obedient unto Jove. I, now the Trojans fall to worke for good, And hale their Vessells downe from all the shoares; The calkt Ships are on floate, and from the wood They bring whole Oakes unwrought, and leavy Oares, For hast to fly away. Through ev'ry gate they pack and trudge amayne: As when the Emmets sally through Earths pores To sack, for hoard, some barne full stuft with graine, Remembring barren Winter must returne againe, The black Troops march, and through the Meadows beare The booty by a narrow path, some hale The heavy Cornes; others bring up the Reere, And prick them forwards that begin to fayle, The busie Labourers ev'ry path engrayle. What sighs gav'st thou now Dido, looking out From thy high Tow'r? How did thy senses quayle, Seeing the shoares so swarm'd, and round about Hearing confused shoutings of the Nautick Rout? O Tyrant Love, how absolute thou art In humane breasts? Againe shee's forc't to fly To teares and pray'rs, and bow her prostrate heart To the subduing passion, glad to trye All cures before the last, which is to dye. Sister, said shee, thou seest they all repaire To th'Port: And only for a winde doe lye, Inviting it with streamers wav'd i'th'ayre: Had I but fear'd this blow, I should not now despaire. Yet try for me this once; For only thee That perjur'd soule adores, to thee will shew His secret thoughts: Thou, when his seasons bee, And where the Man's accessible dost know. Goe sister, meekly speake to the proud Foe. I was not with the Greeks at Aulis sworne To raze the Trojan name, nor did I goe 'Gainst Ilium with my Fleet, neither have torne Anchises ashes up from his profaned urne. Why is he deafe to my intreaties? Whether So fast? It is a Lovers last desire That he would but forsake me in faire weather, And a safe time. I doe not now aspire To his broake Wedlock-vow, neither require He should faire Latium, and a Scepter leave: Poore time I begge, my passions to retyre, Truce to my woe; Nor pardon, but Reprieve, Til griefs, familiar growne, have taught me how to grieve. For sisterhood, for sence of my distresse, Let me this last boone, ere I dye, obtayne. This Dido spake. The sad Ambassadresse Carries her teares, and brings them back againe, (As brackish tydes post from and to the Maine) But not an Ocean of bitter teares Can alter him, nor will he entertaine The flatt'ring force of words: He only heares The Fates, &amp; Joves command, which dams up his mild ears. As an old Oake (but yet not weake with Eld) Which showres and blasts to overthrow contend, It cracks, and (the trunck shooke) leaves strow the field; That sticks in Rocks; whose Roots tow'rds Hell descend As farre as towards Heav'n the boughs ascend: So stands the Heros, beat with winde and rayne, His stout heart groanes, and his affections bend, Shooke with their sighs; But his resolves remaine As unremov'd as Rocks, teares rowle their waves in vaine. Then doth unhappy Dido, given ore By her last hope, desire to dye. The light Is irkesome to her eyes. To confirme more Her purpose to imbrace eternall night, Placing on th'Incence-burning Altars bright Her guifts, the holy water she beheld Converted to black Inke (Portentous sight!) And the powr'd Wine to roaping blood congeal'd. This thing to none, not to her sister, she reveal'd. A Marble Fane too in the house she had, Where lay her first Lords ashes, kept among Her most adored Reliques, 'twas with sad Darke Yew-tree, and the whitest fleeces hung. Hence in the night she heard her husbands toung Call her, she thought. And oft the boading Owle Alone on the house top harsh dirges sung, And with long noates quavr'd a dolefull howle, Besides old Prophesies, which terrifie her soule. Cruell Æneas ev'n her sleepes torments: And still shee dreames shees wandring all alone Through a long way with steep and darke descents, Calling her Tyrians in a Land, where none But some pain'd Ghost Eccho's her with a groane. As when mad Pentheus troops of Furies fright, Who sees a twofold Thebes, and double Sunne: Or when Orestes flyes his Mothers sight, Hunting his bloody track with Hel-hounds by torch-light. Sunke then with griefe, possest with furyes, bent On death, she plots the meanes, and in her Eye A feign'd hope springing, hiding her intent, Accosts sad Anne. Partake thy sisters Joy, I've found a way to make him burne as I, Or turne me cold like him. Neere Phœbus set At the lands end doth Æthiopia lye, Where on great Atlas necke, the Heav'n thick set With glorious Diamond-starres hangs like a Carkanet. Of a great Sorceresse I have been told There borne, who did th'Hesperian Temple keepe, The Dragon fed, and sacred fruit of Gold Watcht on the tree which she for dew did steepe In Honey, and moyst Poppy causing sleepe. Shee undertakes to cure the Love-sicke breast, And whom shee list to plunge in Love as deepe, The waters course in Rivers to arrest, And call down stars from Heav'n, &amp; cal up ghosts from rest. Under her tread thou shalt perceive Earth groane, And Oakes skip from the hills. I swear to thee (Calling the Gods to Record, and thine owne Sweet head) that forc't to these blacke Arts I flee. Thou on some Tow'r a stack build secretly; Lay on it the mans cloathes, and sword which lyes Within, and that which prov'd a grave to me, My Wedding Bed. So doth the Witch advise, Ev'n that I blot out all the traytors memories. This said, grew pale. Yet thinkes not Anne that shee With these new Rites her funerall doth shade, Nor feares such Monsters, or worse extasie Then at Sycheus death; Therefore obay'd. But Dido, a great Pile of wood being made, The place with flow'rs and fatall Cypresse crown'd, Thereon his cloaths and sword bequeathed layd, His Picture on the Bed, the mistick ground Knowne only to her selfe. Altars are placed round. With haire dispread like a black falling storme, Th'Inchantresse thunders out three hundred names, Orchus, and Chaos, Hecate-triforme, Which Virgin Dian's triple-pow'r enseames, She sprinkled too Avernus fabulous streames; And hearbs were sought for, sprouting forth ripe Bane, With brazen siccles, cropt in the Moones beames: And puld from new born Colt, that lumpe, which ta'ne From the Dammes mouth, no love t'her issue doth remaine. Her selfe in a loose vest, one foot unshod, With meale in pious hands neer th'Altar drew. Witnesse yee guilty starres and every God (Saith she) I'm forc't to dye. Invokes them too Who care of Lovers take (if any doe) Unequally. 'Twas night, and conqu'ring sleepe With weari'd bodies the whole earth did strew; When woods are quiet, and the cruell deep, When stars are half way down, when fields stil silence keep. And beasts and painted Birds, which liquid Springs Inhabit, or which bushy Lands containe, Nuzling their cares beneath sleepes downy wings, Doe bury the past dayes forgotten paine; All but the haplesse Queen, she doth refraine From rest, nor takes it at her eyes or heart. After long seeming dead, Love rose againe And fought with wrath, as when two Tydes do thwart, Whilst thus her big thoughts role &amp; wallow to each part. What shall I doe? shall I a suiter be To my old suitors, scorned by the new, And wooe those Kings so oft despis'd by me? What then? shall I the Ilian Fleet pursue, And share all this mans fates? Yes, he doth shew Such sence of my first aydes: Or say I would, Whom he hath mockt, will not his proud ships too Reject? Ah foole, by whom the perjur'd brood Of false Laomedon is not yet understood. Grant they'd admit me, shall I flye alone With Mariners? Or chace him with the power O'th' emptyed Towne, and servants of mine owne, And whom I scarce from Tyre by the roots up tore, Compell to plough the horrid Seas once more? No, dye as thou deserv'st, cure woes with woe. Thou sister, first, when I my teares did showre To quench these rising flames, thou didst them blow, And out of cruell pity soldst me to the Foe. Why might not I (alas) have mourn'd away My widdow'd youth as well as Turtles doe? Nor twice have made my selfe misfortunes prey, Or to Sicheus ashes prov'd untrue? These words with sighs out of her bosome flew. Æneas slept aboord, all things prepard. To whom againe Joves sonne with the same hiew Divine, so silver-voyc'd, so golden hayr'd, So straight and lovely shap't, thus rowsing him appear'd. O Goddesse-borne, now dost thou sleepe? nor know How many dangers watch to compasse thee? Nor heare this good wind whispering thee to goe? Purpos'd to dye, great plots and dire broods she, Who boyles with rage like a high-going Sea. Fly whilst thou mayst flye. If the morning finde Thee napping here, the Sea will cover'd be With Ships, the shoare with flames: Fly with the wind, Trust that, but doe not trust a womans fickle mind. This said, he mixt himselfe with night: But then Æneas at these visions sore agast, Starts out of sleepe, and cryes, up, up, O men, Hoyse up your Sayles, flye to your Oares, row fast; Behold a God from Heav'n again bids haste, Cutting the wreath'd Cable. O, who ere, We follow thee, obey'd as late thou wast Most gladly. Ayde what thou commandst, and steere With prosp'rous stars bespoke as thou fly'st through their sphere. This said, whipt out his Lightning Sword, and strooke The fastning ropes. Like zeale his patterne bred In all. They snatcht, they ran, the shoares forsook, Their Sayles like wings over the waves were spread; They comb'd with Oares gray Neptunes curled head. And now Aurora scattred rosie light Upon the Earth from Tythons purple bed, Whom Dido, having scouted all the night, Discover'd from the Watch-Tow'r by her Ensignes white. Seeing the Fleet sayle smoothly on, she knocks Three or foure times her breast of Ivorie, And tearing piteously her amber Locks, O Jove, but shall he then be gone, said she, And shall a stranger mock my Realme and me? Shall not my pow'rs pursue him from the shoare, And my tall Galleys man'd out instantly? Arme, Arme, ye men of Tyre, bring fire-balls store, Hoyse in a trice the sayles, tug stoutly at the Oare. What talk I? or where am I? Doe I rave? Poore Dido, now you see his heart; before Could you not see it, when your Crowne you gave To his dispose? Behold the faith he swore, Who sav'd his gods, and his old Father bore! I'l strow him on the waves, his men first kill'd, And spitted upon swords, and sawc't in gore, Ascanius to him his last meale shall yeeld, The Fathers yearning bowels with his bowels fill'd. But this would be a doubtfull battaile. Bee't. What should she feare whose wishes are to dye! I will blow up the hatches, burne the Fleet, Sonne, Syre, and Nation in one Bon-fire frye, And my selfe last to crowne the Tragedy. O Sol, the Index of whose purging light Doth all the works of skilfull Nature try; And Juno, cause of this my wofull plight, And Proserpine, cry'd through the Towns in dead of night; And you revenging pow'rs, Gods which pertaine To dying Dido; All of you incline Your Deities to this my prayer; both deigne Gently to heare, and lend me your divine Assistance, due to such high wrongs as mine. If one so clog'd with perjuries as he, Must needs attaine the Port he doth designe, And swim to shoare, because his Destiny So wills, and such is Joves immutable Decree; Yet vext b'a warlike people, forc't to flye, Torne and divorc't from his deare sonnes imbrace, Let him beg forraigne ayde, see his men dye For crimes not theirs: And let him, when a peace Shall be concluded by him with disgrace, Enjoy nor Crown, nor life (then seeming good), But be cut off in middle of his race, And uninterr'd float on the restlesse Flood: Thus pray I, these last words I powre out with my blood. Then you, O Tyrians, breed your children in Successive hate, so shall my wrong'd ghost rest; Let Peace or Faith with these be held a sinne, Some one of ours with fire and sword infest The proud Æneiades where ere they nest, And through the world once more the straglers drive; Now or hereafter, when your strength serves best; Be shoares oppos'd to shoares, let our tydes strive With theirs, and our late sons keep endlesse war alive. This said, she cast to flye dayes loathed beames, And calls Sichæus Nurse (her owne was dead.) Good Nurse, goe bid my sister, dasht with streames, Come straight, and bring the beasts I ordered For Sacrifice: Doe thou too bind thy head With holy Fillet, I will consummate Rites well begun, to Dis, and fire the Bed Where the mans Portraict's laid, t'annihilate All care; so she did gallop at an old wives rate. But Dido, fearing what she wisht, sad doome, Rowling her blood-shot eyes, and in her face The palenesse of the death which was to come, With trembling spots, rusht to that secret place, And climbing the high Pile with furious pace, The Dardan Sword, not therefore given, unsheath'd. Spying the clothes and well-known bed, a space She paws'd, till some few teares she had bequeath'd, And leaning on that bed her latest speech she breath'd. Sweet pledges, whilst the Fates and Jove so will'd, Receive this soule, and free me from this woe; I liv'd, and my good Fortunes circle filld: And now my great Ghost to Elizium goe. I built a famous City, saw it grow To the perfection which it boasts this day; Reveng'd my Husband on his brother-foe: My too much happinesse had lackt allay, If Iliums wandring Fleet had never past this way. Then groveling on the bed, but shall I dye, And not reveng'd? Yes, dye; what, so present My selfe to Dis? Even so. Drink with thine eye Fierce Trojan this flames Comet-like portent, And let my death bode thee a dire event. Here her Maids saw her with spread hands fall downe Upon the reeking blade; A shrill cry went To the high roofes, and through th'astonisht towne, Swift as a Thunder-bolt the raging newes was blown. With sighs, laments, shriekes, and a female yell Earth sounds, and Heavens high battlements resound, As if, the foe let in, all Carthage fell, Or mother walls of Tyre were brought to ground, And Fanes and Houses one flame did confound. Her frighted sister heares the baleful noyse, She thumps her bosome, and with nayles doth wound Her face, distracted through the prease she flyes, And Dido, Dido, O my sister Dido, cryes. Was this the businesse? wouldst thou cozen me? Those fires, piles, Altars, hid they this beneath? Skorndst thou in Fate thy sisters company? I might have been invited to thy death; One Sword, and one houre, should have reft our breath. Must I too build the Pile, and Heaven invoke For this? Thy cruell hand extinguisheth Thy selfe, and me, Senate and common folke, And thy new-raised town, with one all-murth'ring stroke. Teares bathe her wounds, suck her last breath my lips, If any about hers yet hov'ring stayes. This said, she passes the high stayres, and clips Her halfe-dead sister, whom she fostring layes To her warme breasts, and as the breath decayes, Sighs new, the gore-blood with her garment dry'd. Shee, striving her eyes heavy lids to raise, Fainted againe, her wounds mouth gaping wide, Vents by a neerer way her hearts groans through her side. Thrice on her arme she did her body stay, Thrice tumbled backward, and with rowling eyes Groapt for, and sigh'd to finde, the glaring day. Then Juno pitying her long Agonies, And pangs of death, sent Iris from the skyes, Her wrastling soule from twisting limbs t'untwine. For since of age nor malady she dyes, But by despaire nipt early, Proserpine Had not yet cut her haire, and said, This head is mine. So Iris her great Mistris will obeyes, Descending to the Earth immediately On curious wings, which the Suns oblique rayes With water colours painted variously: And standing right over her head (said she) As I am bid, these vowed locks I beare To Hells black Prince, and doe pronounce thee free From bodies bonds. This said, cut off her hayre, Heat left her, and th'uncaged Soule flew through the Ayre. FINIS. A HAPPY LIFE out of Martiall The things that make a life to please (Sweetest Martiall) they are these: Estate inherited, not got: A thankfull Field, Hearth alwayes hot: City seldome, Law-suits never: Equall Friends agreeing ever: Health of Body, Peace of Minde: Sleepes that till the Morning binde: Wise Simplicitie, Plaine Fare: Not drunken Nights, yet loos'd from Care: A Sober, not a sullen Spouse: Cleane strength, not such as his that Plowes: Wish onely what thou art, to bee; Death neither wish, nor feare to see. On the Earle of Straffords Tryall The Earle yet made a gallant stand, to be Judg'd by one Kingdome, and arraign'd by three. He might have fled at first, or made his skreene A Royall Master, or a Gracious Queene; But this had been the Touch-stone to decline, T'ingage in Mortalls Quarrels, Powers Divine. As artlesse Poets Jove or Juno use, To play the Mid-wife to their labouring Muse. No, he affects a labour'd Scene, and not To cut, but to untye the Gordian knot. Then if 'twill prove no Comedy, at least To make it of all Tragedies the best. And that hee'l doe; I know not what past fact May speake him lesse, but for his lifes last act, Times shall admiring read it, and this age, Though now it hisse, claps when he leaves the Stage; So stand or fall, none stood so, or so fell; This farre-fam'd Tryall hath no paralell. But if i'th' Senate, Cæsar had been try'd, As he was stab'd, whilst with their hands fast ty'd, The Armies had lookt on, and left the Cause Of Rome to Tully onely, and the Lawes, Thus had great Julius spoke, and lookt; distill'd Pharsalia, Munda, Thapsus hard-fought Feld, All into Speeches; and free Cato mov'd, (Though he could never feare) yet then t'have lov'd, And pittyed him: For mixt of Peace and Warre, He was a Souldier and an Oratour. A Cæsar? or a Strafford? Hee resolv'd, T'abide no tryall: This, to be absolv'd Or dye. Herein more like to Otho farre, Who gave his blood to quench a Civill Warre. The Earles pathetical Letter to the King, which is to be seene in print, wherein hee begges of his Majesty, to passe the Bill for his death, to quiet the Kingdomes. Nor shall he dye, unlesse these broyles t'asswage A yet more Civill Warre himselfe shall wage, Turne (what hee us'd so well for his defence) Against himselfe, his conquering Eloquence, Spend his whole stock of favour too, to bring To the Three Kingdomes a fourth Power, the King: A Fourth Estate adde to the Parliament: And to the Royall give his owne assent. So fell great Rome her selfe, opprest at length By the united Worlds, and her owne strength. Presented TO HIS HIGHNESSE THE PRINCE OF WALES, At his going into the West, Ann. M. DC. XLV. Together with CESAR'S COMMENTARIES Sir, Now that your Father, with the World's applause, Imployes your early Valour in his Cause, Set Cesar's glorious Acts before your sight, And know the man that could so doe and write. View him in all his postures, see him mix Terrour with love, Morals with Politicks. That courage, which when fortune ebb'd did flow, Which never trampled on a prostrate Foe, Admire and emulate. Before hee fought, Observe how Peace by him was ever sought: How bloodlesse Victories best pleas'd him still, Grieving as oft as he was forc'd to kill. How most religiously he kept his word, And conquer'd more that way then by the sword. In whom was all wee in a King could crave, Except that Right which you shall one day have. Yet think (Sir) it imports you to make good With all his worth the title of your blood. Presented TO HIS HIGHNESSE, In the West, Ann. Dom. 1646 Grow Royall Plant, born for your Country's good, The hoped cure of our great flux of blood. That Union, and that peacefull golden Age, W?? to your Grandsire Buchanan in his Genethliacon to King James, out of which this is taken. ancient Bards presage, And we suppos'd fulfill'd in Him, appears By Fate reserved for your riper yeers. And Thou, self-hurt since that half-Union more Then ever, Britain, thou hadst been before, Raise thy dejected head, bind up thy hair With peacefull Olive, all those things repair Which fire and sword deface, and call agen To their spoyl'd mansions thy fled Husbandmen. They need not fear to come, this Prince's Starrs Promise an end to all our Civill Warrs. Never shall English Scots, nor Scots again Infest the English with dire feuds, and stain Their swords in brothers blood, thy Towns lay waste: But their hands (prompt to War) henceforth make haste To clasp in an eternall League. And You (Blest Parents of a blessed Son) add to His great Birth equall Breeding; Civill Arts To Arts of Warre, and Pietie to Parts. No Ship the Rudder so much turns and windes As Princes manners do their Peoples mindes. Not Prisons, penall Lawes, sharp Whips, severe Axes, with all the instruments of fear, Can so constrain, as the dumb eloquence Of Vertue; and the love and reverence Of a well-govern'd Scepter shall perswade Their wils, by great Examples eas'ly sway'd. As when th'Arabian Phœnix doth return From his perfumed cradle (his Sires Urn), Where e're he flyes the feather'd people throng With acclamations to salute the young Admired King, not for his purple Seares And golden Pounce (the Regall marks hee bears), Nor that he's rarely seen; but 'cause he brings His Fathers honour'd ashes on his wings, And funerall odours, that it may be known He climb'd not till his death his spicie throne: (This Pietie, a Vertue understood By brutes, attracts them: such a sense of good Nature that heav'nly Steward doth dispense To every living thing that hath but sense) So do the People fix their eyes upon The King; admire, love, honour Him alone. In Him, as in a glasse, their manners view And frame, and copie what they see Him doe. That which the murdring Cannon cannot force, Nor plumed Squadrons of steel-glittering Horse, Love can. In this the People strive t'out-doe The King; and when they find they're lov'd, love too. They serve, because they need not serve: and if A good Prince slack the reins, they make them stiffe; And of their own accords invite that yoke, Which, if inforc't on them, they would have broke. And Hee again, with this more tender grown, More Father of his People, on his owne Shoulders assumes their burthens, beats the way Which they must tread, and is the first t'obey What he commands; to pardon others prone, Inexorable to himself alone. Neither in Diet, Clothes, nor Train will He Exceed those banks should bound ev'n Majesty; Nor rush like beasts to Venus, but confine His chast desires to his own geniall Vine. Who will with Silks his manly limbs un-nerve, That sees domestick Wooll his Soveraign serve? Who can the married bed too narrow think, Which holds a King? or drown himself in drink Under a sober Prince? Who'l dare t'import Beyond-sea vices to infect a Court, And make his body with excesse and ease A sink to choak his soul in, when he sees A Monarch curb his pleasures, and suppresse Those weeds which make a Man a Wildernesse? Such golden Tiber saw the peacefull Throne Of holy Numa, that of Solomon Palmie Euphrates. 'Twas not the keen blade, Or the thick-quilted numerous Legion made Those Thrones secure: 'Twas not the warlike Steed, Nor the sythe-armed Chariots furious speed: But Wisdome, Mercy, (which no harm will cause) And Majestie, fenc'd with unarmed Lawes. Whilest that great Captain, who the World had quell'd, And those proud Lords that Rome in bondage held, By steel or poyson ended their short date Of pow'r, and blood with blood did expiate. Frank Nature never gave a better thing, Nor ever will to men, then a good King; In whom his own true Image God doth place. This, whether Kings shall in themselves deface By ougly Vice, or other men by wit Or force demolish, God will punish it As a high Sacriledge, and will not see Himself abused in Effigie. So cruell Nero, fierce Domitian so, And the Sicilian Tirants, whilst they throw Dirt in their Makers face with their black deeds, Are from the earth cut off, they and their seeds. So those rebellious servants that durst joyn Against their Lords, and impious Cataline That strove to wrest the sword from them to whom It was committed by the Lawes of Rome, Pursu'd to fury and despair, did make Hard shift by a most wretched death to shake Their loathed lives off, leaving on their name The blot and brand of never-dying shame. These lessons let his tender yeers receive; His riper, practise: And let him believe, 'Tis not so much both Indies to command, As first to rule himself, and then a Land. ADDITIONAL POEMS An Oade Splendidis longum valedico nugis Yee Vanity's of humane Race, That lead fond youth the Wildgoose-chace, Mindless of after good; Bee-gone y'are vnderstood. Butt thou, my darling Vanity, ffoe to my thriueing, Poetry, Whose loue, begunne at first, My vnwise Tutour nurst; What witch, with her inchanting rodd, Can loose mee from thy Charms, what God? Not Pegasus cann mee ffrom thy Chymera's free. Butt prethee leaue mee, leaue mee sweete, And take thee to thy pritty feet. Oh heavens? why did you sow The seed that may not grow? Goe, Wanton, where some witty heire, That's tangled in thy worded snare, Invites thee with much coine, And Baths of choicest Wine. There kindle thy Seraphick fyre Where there is fuell, there aspire; To match the Eagles flight, ffedd for so proud a height. Those that cann spare their idle howres To cull from learned leaues the flowres, To make 'vhm curious posy's; Those may pamper their noses. In Rich mans gardens thou't bee held A fflow'r, but in the poore mans feild, That him with Corne should feed, A flower is a weed. Younger Brothers must not wedd As they are by affection ledd; Alas! if that might bee Id'e wiue no Art but thee. As 'tis both parts it doth behoue To leaue betimes this foolish Loue, And enter wiser bands: Then here lett vs breake hands. Thou catch some heire, (there's none will shunne To meet thee) I to the Law will runne: Now then; vnless th'adst lother Wee kept in hell together. [My quench't and discontinu'd Muse] My quench't and discontinu'd Muse Her idle fyres againe renewes; Which from my course do mee withdraw, The thriueing Law. Oh? whether rapt in wakeing dreames, Through Hills, through Dales, by tumbling streames, (Places which sadd fancy loues) And silent Groues? Yett I my reason place in sight, And bidd mine eyes pursue that light; Butt they (bewitch't) haue fixt their gaze On t'other Rayes. Whence, the free Councells of my frends, Nor my owne choyce of better ends, Nor this poore pleading without fee, Cann ransome mee. I would not (fayre) spinn out my braynes In Rhyme; this breast such work disdaynes, And something, that to north aspires, ffaintly desires. Which makes mee hate the Thespyan springs, That trayne mee from more sollid things: No fruits to shew of all my howres, Only some flow'rs. Butt Phœbus pulls mee by the arme, And, foole, quoth hee, who does thee harme? Trees haue, that fruite in Autumne bring, Their flow'rs in spring. Vpon the report of fowre Kings dead at once Grow fatt, pale death, and hide thy bones, If currant rumour truly sings, There's made into thy Stock at once, A Mournevell of Kings. And two of them, that may command Our teares, are our Bohemiah, dead In th'entry of his promisd Land, And that victor'ous Sweed That with a slender Colony The Eagle on her prey durst braue, And, in the heart of Germany, Conquer'd himselfe a graue. Kings are but mortall Gods I see, And they must dy like men, and fall, Diff'ring from one of base degree Butt in their ffunerall. A Dreame I saw two swans come proudly downe the streame Of Trent, as I his silver curles beheld; To which, the doves that draw fayre Venus' teame, And Venus selfe, must beauty's scepter yield. Jove was not halfe so white, when he was one, And courted Leda in a snowy plume; Nor never such a taking shape put on, Of all that love compelled him to assume. Fayre birds, allied to him that set on fire The world, why do ye so delight in floods? And kindling in a thousand hearts desire, Quench his soft movings in your gentle bloods? Ah! since so many live in flames for you, Leave to be swans, growe salamanders too. On a Lady that vowed not to curle her hayre till her Brother returned from beyond Sea Cœlia hath for a brothers absence sworne (Rash oath) that since her tresses cannott mourne In black, because vnshorne Apollo's hayre Darts not a greater splendour through the Ayre; Shee'l make them droope in her neglect: forgett Those rings which her white hand in order sett, And curiously did ev'ry morning curle Into a thousand snares the wanton purle. Butt they, are disobedient to command; And sweare they owe no homage to her hand; That Nature is their Mistress, in her name The priviledge, which they were borne too, claime; Skorning to haue it sayd the hayre gaue place To the perfections which all parts doe grace: So winde themselues in wreaths, and curle now more By carelessness, then by her care before. Like a crispt Comett which the starrs pursue In throngs, and mortalls with pale horror veiw Threatning some great mans death, such light displays Her brow: Or like a Saint crowned with Rayes. Lady, what bootes neglect of face or hayre? You must vse art if you will grow less fayre. Sonnets translated out of Spanish 1. [Soare high, my Loue, check not thy gallant flight] Soare high, my Loue, check not thy gallant flight With thought of that ill-fated Youth, to whome (fallne like a Starre from his presumptuous heighth) The greedie Sea was a Diaphane tombe. Thy downie wings strech to the gentle winde, Auoiding the dead sea of cold despaire, And rays'd aboue the Clowdes, a passage finde, To the inflamed Region of the Ayre. With actiue circles crowne that golden Sphere, 'Gainst which the Royall Bird refines his sight, Shewing what kinde he is by looking there, And melt thy wings yet at the noblest Light. Since to the Ocean, and her pearlie shore, My glorious ruine addes one title more. 2. [That louelie mouth, which doth to taste invite] That louelie mouth, which doth to taste invite Balsamine moisture between pearles distill'd, Not enuying that immortall lickour fill'd To Joue by his from Ida stolne delight, Touch it not, Louers; on your liues abstaine; For twixt her lipps, spreading his silken snares, Like traytrous Snake mongst flowers to sting vnwares, Loue, arm'd with all his poyson, doth remaine. Let not those blossoms tempt you, which bedew'd With pearles, and breathing virgin fragrancie, The Morne presentes to the inchanted eye, Like Roses from her purple bosome strewd. Apples they are of Tantalus, indu'de With mystick power, t'inflame, and to delude. 3. [That virgin-Rose, which, while she grew (though crown'd] That virgin-Rose, which, while she grew (though crown'd With prickles sweet) was glorie of the Vale, Dandled by wanton winds, fainting and pale, Yeelds vp her purple honour to the ground. The fragrancies she had, remaine in death, Or may it not be sayd, she doth but rest Against the Earth, like flowers, w?? rayne opprest. How is she dead, that hath not lost her breath? Her bloudlesse leaues, her natiue Betis mournes; But not her sweetnes; groueling on his sands, Exhausted Tagus, his hidd gold vp-turnes. She's now transplanted by the maker's hands, Amongst those flowers a better Morne adornes, Whose fading deaw are the bright starrie bands. 4. [Thou, Loue, by whome y? naked Soule is view'd] Thou, Loue, by whome y? naked Soule is view'd, Recounte to vs, with what disdaines and hart Of proofe could Phillis (with such forme endued) Resist so long thy sharpest golden dart. And those close doubts, and strugling reasons shew, With which being vanquisht she her wound conceal'd. If it were Pride, or Shame, which made her so Denye with language, what dumb shews reveal'd. What we without could see, was that her face Like blushing Rose putt on a Crimson dye; And her eyes hidd themselves with bashful grace, Like languishing Apollo, drawing nigh His races end; when his bright beames he shrowdes, And, with vermilion-flakes, adornes the Clowdes. 5. [O endlesse smart, and endlesse wisht to be] O endlesse smart, and endlesse wisht to be, Which as a rauisht pleasure I embrace, My Capitall and bosome ennemie, My Hell, in which my thoughts their Heauen place. Since I'me enamourd of the Hellish payne, And willingly thy scorching torments proue, Why dost thou then vnsought-for friendship faigne; And doing acts of hate, art called Loue? I see the sweet rayes of her heau'nlie glance, With which the hardest hart of Cristall thawes, Her amorous and disdainefull Countenance, And the effects are Ecchoes of the cause. I feele a freezing flame, my bosome chill, A scalding ice through euerie veyne distill. 6. [Whether thou curle, or trence thy natiue gold] Whether thou curle, or trence thy natiue gold, And workst it pliant into euerie forme, Or leau'st it by thy Maydes to be vnrolld, Falling about thy neck like Danae's storme: Or whether richly 'tis enamelled With chearfull Emeralds, and blew Saphire veynes, Or crown'd with tossing plumes, which hide thy head, Hunting the Hart ore the enameld Playnes, Venus mistakes thee for her rurall Louer, Whome late Adonis for his Venus tooke; Whilst change of dresses doth by turnes discouer A louelie Swaine, and Goddesse in thy looke. But I, to whome they both vnited seeme, In loue with her, growe iealous strayte of him. 7. [Strange Tyrannie! with smiles to kill your Louers!] Strange Tyrannie! with smiles to kill your Louers! With shew of parley, is't not treacherie? T'inveigle Hope, which frustrated discouers How he that's fauour'd most, shall surest dye. Like the first Cherries (ripening in a nett) Thy lipps are watcht; or as some minyon-flower In couer'd Potts on the Kings Tarras sett, On which the raynie Heauens forbidd to lower. Few are lett in, the Gardner dares not touch it, Not the Sunne view it with too amorous rayes. It shunnes the grosser ayres, least they should smutch it, With whose coye leaues y? winde, euen trembling, playes. But Cynthia, 'tis a vice with faire-ones borne; Yee bate with smiles, to catch whome yee may scorne. 8. [Though bound to Rocks of Faith with golden chaine] Though bound to Rocks of Faith with golden chaine, Faire Amarillis stands before my sight, Whilst sleeping in a peacefull calme y? Mayne Presentes to th'eye an obiect of delight, And though soft Westerne gales (all doubt to cleare) The winde which swelles my Saile dispense my graines, And in the Heau'ns smooth forhead doth appeare A happie Period writt to crowne my paynes; Yet on the fatall shore I can descrye So manie vninterred bones of those, Who thought Loues Ocean as secure as I, That I mistrust it yet, for all these showes: If sweet Arion doe not charme the deepe, If Palinurus at the Helme should sleepe. 9. The Praise of the Winde If words are winde, which (guilt with eloquence) Like windes at sea, doe mens affections turne Which way they list, and (lin'd with noble sense) To highest place preferre the meanest borne, If that preferrement's winde, and all those Arts To which these gallant Spiritts are inclin'd: If life was winde, is winde, to winde conuerts, And Beautie is the Musick of that winde: If warre-begotten Honour be no more, Nor Vertue in her mortall morall part, Nor a good Name (although deseru'd before) Nor all the Heart desires, or decks the Heart: Let vs esteeme the Winde then, since we finde, That the worlds firmest Glorie, it is Winde. Two Choruses from II Pastor Fido O Love! how potent and how great thou art! Wonder of nature and the world! What heart So dull, as not to feel thy pow'r? What wit So deep and piercing, as to fathom it? Who knows thy hot lascivious fires; will say, Infernall spirit, thou dost live and sway In the corporeall part. But who so knowes How thou dost men to vertuous things dispose, And how the dying flame of loose desires Looks pale, and trembles at thy chaster fires; Will say, Immortall God, i'th' soul alone Thou hast established thy sacred Throne. “Rare Monster! wonderfully got betwixt “Desire and Reason; an affection mixt “Of sense and intellect: With knowing wilde: “With seeing blinde: A God, and yet a childe: And (such) thou sway'st the Earth and Heaven too; On which thou tread'st as we on t'other do. Yet (by thy leave) a greater miracle, A mightier thing then thou art I can tell. For all thou do'st (that may our wonder claim) Thou dost by vertue of a womans name. Woman! the gift of heav'n; or of him rather Who made thee fairer, being of both the Father. Wherein is Heav'n so beautifull as thou? That rowls one goggle eye in its vast brow (Like a grim Cyclop) not a lamp of light, But cause of blindnesse and Cymerian night To the bold gazer: if that speak, it is A thundring voice; and if it sigh, the hisse Of earth-engendred windes. Thou, with the fair Angel-like prospect of two Suns, which are Serene and visible, doest still the windes And calm the Billows of tempestuous mindes; And Sound, Light, Motion, Beauty, Majesty, Make in thy face so sweet a harmony, That heav'n (I mean this outward heav'n) must needs Confesse thy form the form of that exceeds: Since beauty that is dead lesse noble is Then that which lives, and is a place of blisse. With reason therefore man (that gallant creature, That lords it over all the works of Nature) To thee as Lady Paramount payes duty, Acknowledging in thine, thy Makers beauty. And if hee Triumphs gain, and Thrones inherit, It is not because thou hast lesse of merit; But for thy glory: since a greater thing It is to conquer, then to be a King. But that thy conqu'ring beauty doth subdue Not onely man, but ev'n his Reason too, If any doubt, hee in Mirtillo hath A miracle that may constrain his faith. This wanted (Woman) to thy pow'r before To make us love when we can hope no more. Fair golden Age! when milk was th'onely food, And cradle of the infant-world the wood (Rock'd by the windes); and th'untoucht flocks did bear Their deer young for themselves! None yet did fear The sword or poyson: no black thoughts begun T'eclipse the light of the eternall Sun: Nor wandring Pines unto a forreign shore Or War, or Riches, (a worse mischief) bore. That pompous sound, Idoll of vanity, Made up of Title, Pride, and Flattery, Which they call Honour whom Ambition blindes, Was not as yet the Tyrant of our mindes. But to buy reall goods with honest toil Amongst the woods and flocks, to use no guile, Was honour to those sober souls that knew No happinesse but what from vertue grew. Then sports and carols amongst Brooks and Plains Kindled a lawfull flame in Nymphs and Swains. Their hearts and Tongues concurr'd, the kisse and joy Which were most sweet, and yet which least did cloy, Hymen bestow'd on them. To one alone The lively Roses of delight were blown; The theevish Lover found them shut on triall, And fenc'd with prickles of a sharp denyall. Were it in Cave or Wood, or purling Spring, Husband and Lover signifi'd one thing. Base present age, which dost with thy impure Delights the beauty of the soul obscure: Teaching to nurse a Dropsie in the veins: Bridling the look, but giv'st desire the reins. Thus, like a net that spread and cover'd lies With leaves and tempting flow'rs, thou dost disguise With coy and holy arts a wanton heart; “Mak'st life a Stage-play, vertue but a part: “Nor thinkst it any fault Love's sweets to steal, “So from the world thou canst the theft conceal. But thou that art the King of Kings, create In us true honour: Vertue's all the state Great souls should keep. Vnto these cels return Which were thy Court, but now thy absence mourn: From their dead sleep with thy sharp goad awake Them who, to follow their base wils, forsake Thee, and the glory of the ancient world. “Let's hope: our ills have truce till we are hurld “From that: Let's hope; the sun that's set may rise, “And with new light salute our longing eyes.</field>
