      <field name="fulltext">This Volume is gratefully inscribed to THE MANY FRIENDS IN AMERICA (known and unknown) of THE AUTHOR of ‚ÄúTHE LIGHT OF ASIA‚Äù</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 Allah ‚ÄúAllah!‚Äù Bi-'smi-'llah! Say that God is One, Living, Eternal; and besides Him none. 2Ar-Rahm√¢n Say Ar-Rahm√¢n! ‚ÄúThe Merciful‚Äù Him call; For He is full of mercy unto all. Once on a day, in Paradise, Discourse indignant did arise Amongst the Angels, seeing how The sons of Adam sinned below; Albeit Allah's grace had sent Prophets with much admonishment. ‚ÄúHeedless and guilty race,‚Äù they cried, ‚ÄúWhose penitence is set aside At each temptation! Truth and Right Ye know not!‚Äù Then a wondrous light Fell on their brows‚Äîa mighty word Sounded‚Äîthe Presence of the Lord Spake: ‚ÄúOf your number choose ye two To go among mankind and do ‚ÄòJustice and Right,‚Äô teaching them these.‚Äù Therewith, from those bright companies, Har√ªt went and Mar√ªt went down One version of this legend says that Soharah (or Zoharah) herself, the spirit of the planet Venus, descended to tempt the two Angels. Har√ªt and Mar√ªt are fabled to be confined still in the vicinity of Babel, where a man may go to learn sorcery of them, hearing their voices, but never seeing their forms. On earth, laying aside their crown Of rays, and plumes of rainbow feather; And on the judgment-seat together Many long years they sate, and wrought Just judgment upon each cause brought. Until, before that justice-seat There came a woman, fair and sweet, So ravishing of form and mien That great Soharah, who is queen Of the third planet, hath not eyes As soft, nor mouth made in such wise. And one whom she did wrong, besought Sentence against her: she had nought Of plea, but in her dazzling grace Stood fearless in the audience-place; Consuming hearts with hot desire By subtle Beauty's searching fire. Then said Har√ªt, forgetting Heaven, ‚ÄúPardon to such must, sure, be given.‚Äù Whispered Mar√ªt, ‚ÄúIf thou wilt be Leman of mine, thou shalt go free.‚Äù And for her love those two contended, Till the false scene was sorely ended With earthquake, and with lightningflash, And rolling thunder's wrathful crash, 'Midst which the city and the folk Passed from their ken, and a Voice spoke: ‚ÄúCome unto judgment, ye who called Allah too merciful!‚Äù Appalled Har√ªt lay and Mar√ªt lay prone In Paradise, before the Throne; Hearing that doom of God, which said: ‚ÄúUntil My trumpet calls the dead, Dwell on the earth, where ye have learned The just may unto sin be turned.‚Äù Merciful One and just! we bless Thy name, and crave forgiveness. 3Ar-Raheem Say Ar-Raheem! call Him ‚ÄúCompassionate,‚Äù For He is pitiful to small and great. 'Tis written that the serving-angels stand Beside God's throne, ten myriads on each hand, Waiting, with wings outstretched and watchful eyes, To do their Master's heavenly embassies. Quicker than thought His high commands they read, Swifter than light to execute them speed; Bearing the word of power from star to star Some hither and some thither, near and far. And unto these nought is too high or low, Too mean or mighty, if He wills it so; Neither is any creature, great or small, Beyond His pity; which embraceth all, Because His eye beholdeth all which are; Sees without search, and counteth without care. Nor lies the babe nearer the nursing-place Than Allah's smallest child to Allah's grace; Nor any ocean rolls so vast that He Forgets one wave of all that restless sea. Thus it is written; and moreover told How Gabriel, watching by the Gates of gold, Gabriel, or Jibrail, is called in Arabian theology R√ª'h-el-Am√Æn, ‚Äúthe Faithful Spirit,‚Äù or R√ª'h-el-Kudd√ªs, ‚Äúthe Holy Spirit.‚Äù It was he who delivered the Kor√¢n to Muhammad. Heard from the Voice Ineffable this word Of two-fold mandate uttered by the Lord: ‚ÄúGo earthward! pass where Solomon hath made His pleasure-house, and sitteth there arrayed, Goodly and splendid‚Äîwhom I crowned the king‚Äî For at this hour My servant doth a thing Unfitting: out of Nisibis there came A commentator on this legend writes:‚Äî ‚ÄúSome say that Solomon brought these horses, being a thousand in number, from Damascus and Nisibis, which cities he had taken; others say that they were left him by his father, who took them from the Amalekites; while others, who prefer the marvellous, pretend that they came up out of the sea, and had wings. However, Solomon, having one day a mind to view the horses, ordered them to be brought before him, and was so taken up with them that he spent the remainder of the day, till after sunset, in looking on them; by which means he almost neglected the prayer, which ought to have been said at that time, till it was too late: but when he perceived his omission, he was so greatly concerned at it, that ordering the horses to be brought back, he killed them all as an offering to God, except only a hundred of the best of them. But God made him ample amends for the loss, by giving him dominion over the winds.‚Äù A thousand steeds with nostrils all a-flame And limbs of swiftness, prizes of the fight; Lo! these are led, for Solomon's delight, Before the palace, where he gazeth now Filling his heart with pride at that brave show; So taken with the snorting and the tramp Of his war-horses, that Our silver lamp Of eve is swung in vain, Our warning Sun Will sink before his sunset-prayer's begun; So shall the people say, ‚ÄòThis king, our lord, Loves more the long-maned trophies of his sword Than the remembrance of his God?‚Äô Go in! Save thou My faithful servant from such sin.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlso, upon the slope of Arafat, Arafat is a mountain near Mecca, so named from the tradition that Adam, upon his repentance, was reunited there to Eve, after a separation of two hundred years. Beneath a lote-tree which is fallen flat, Toileth a yellow ant who carrieth home Food for her nest, but so far hath she come Her worn feet fail, and she will perish, caught In the falling rain; but thou, make the way naught, And help her to her people in the cleft Of the black rock.‚Äù Silently Gabriel left The Presence, and prevented the king's sin, And holp the little ant at entering in. O Thou whose love is wide and great, We praise Thee, ‚ÄúThe Compassionate.‚Äù 4Al-M√¢lik Call Him ‚ÄúAl-M√¢lik,‚Äù King of all the kings, Maker and Master of created things. The Sultan of Damascus found asleep The potter Ebn Sol√ªl, And bore him to the palace, where he waked In garments beautiful. Consider! if a king should call thee ‚Äúfriend,‚Äù And lead thee to his court, Roofed large with lazulite, and pavemented With flow'rs, on green floors wrought; If he should bid thee sit at meat; and spread A table, served so fine There lacked not any pleasant food or fruit But came at call of thine; If he hung high a glorious golden lamp To shine where thy feet tread; And stretched black 'broidered hangings, sown with gems, For curtains to thy bed; If for thy heats he bade soft zephyrs blow; Sent, at thy thirst, sweet rains; And filled the groves with minstrels, gaily garbed, To charm thee with their strains; If, past the confines of his palace-grounds, He showed thee spacious seas, Where, wafted o'er the dancing foam, might sail Thou and thine argosies; If, for society in that fair place, He gave glad companies, Kinsmen and friends and helpmates, and the bliss Of beauty's lips and eyes; With wisdom's scroll to study, and the ways Of wondrous living things; And lovely pleasure of all ornaments That Nature's treasure brings, Coral and pearl; turkis, and agate stones Milk-white or rosy-veined; Amber and ivory; jade; shawls wove with gold, Scarves with sea-purple stained; If the king gave thee these, and only wrote Upon his inner door: ‚ÄúServe me and honour me and keep my laws, And thus live evermore In better bliss, when ye shall pass hereby,‚Äî As surely pass ye must:‚Äî‚Äù Who is there would not praise that monarch's name With forehead in the dust? Lo! but He doeth this‚ÄîAllah our King, His sky is lazulite; His earth is paved with emerald-work; its stores Are spread for man's delight; His sun by day, His silver stars by night, Shine for our sakes, His breeze Cools us and wafts our ships; His pleasant lands Are girdled with the seas Which send the rain, and make the crystal bridge Whereby man roams at will From court to court of Allah's pleasure-house; Seeing that writing still Upon the inner gate‚Äîwhich all must pass‚Äî ‚ÄúLove me and keep my laws That ye may live, since there is greater life Beyond these darkened doors.‚Äù If Ebn Sol√ªl, the potter, loved Him not Whose kindness was so strong; If Ebn Sol√ªl kept not the palace laws, Had not that Sultan wrong? O Sovereign Giver of good things, We praise Thee, ‚ÄúM√¢lik,‚Äù King of kings. 5Al-Kudd√ªs Isr√¢f√Æl is one of the Archangels, who will sound the last trumpet at the resurrection. He has ‚Äúthe sweetest voice of all God's creatures.‚Äù Allah-al-Kudd√ªs‚Äîthe ‚ÄúHoly One‚Äù He is; But purify thy speech, pronouncing this; For even Israfil, Who waits in Heaven still Nearest the Throne, and hath the voice of sweetness, Before his face doth fold The wings of feathered gold, Saying ‚ÄúAl-Kudd√ªs;‚Äù and in supreme completeness Of lowly reverence stands, Laying his angel-hands Over his lips, lest Allah's holiest name Be lightly breathed on high; And that white mystery Pass, as if that and others were the same. Cf. Kor√¢n, cxiv. chapter ‚ÄúOf men.‚ÄùIbl√Æs‚Äî'tis written‚Äîwhen Ibl√Æs, ‚ÄúHe who despairs,‚Äù is Shait√¢n, or Satan, who fell from Heaven on account of arrogantly refusing to pay reverence to Adam at the creation, when all the other Angels worshipped the first man. He heareth among men The name of ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù spoken, shrinks and flies; But at the sound of this, Uttered in realms of bliss, The Djins and Angels, in their ranks, arise. And what believer dares Begin his morning prayers Without ‚Äúwuzu‚Äúh‚Äù‚Äîth'ablution? who is seen Wuz√ª'h, or washing (either with actual water, or by imitating the process with sand, &amp;c.), must precede all those prayers which are farz, or ‚Äúincumbent.‚Äù These are commenced in a standing attitude, Kiy√¢m, the thumbs touching the lobes of the ears and the face turning towards Mecca. His Kor√¢n to rehearse But hath in mind its verse, ‚ÄúLet none me touch, save such as are made clean?‚Äù Lo! if with streams or sands Ye lave the earnest hands Lifted in prayer; and if ye wash the mouth Which reads the sacred scroll, Dare ye with sullied soul Meditate this dread word, that shrines the truth Of Allah's purity? Bethink! His great eyes see The hearts of men unto their inmost core! Make clean your hearts within; Cast forth each inmost sin; Then with bowed brows, say this name, and adore. Forgive, Thou Pure One!‚ÄîWhom we bless‚Äî Of our good deeds the sinfulness. 6As-Sal√¢m Thou Who art ‚ÄúPeace,‚Äù and unto peace dost bring, Allah-as-Sal√¢m! we praise Thee, judge and King! When th' unshunn√´d Day arriveth, none of men shall doubt it come; Into Hell some it will lower, and exalt to Heaven some. When the earth with quakenings quaketh, and the mountains crumble flat, The ‚ÄúCompanions of the right hand‚Äù are so called because they will have the book of their good deeds put into their right hands in token of salvation; while evildoers will have their scroll of condemnation, at the last day, thrust into their left hands. Quick and dead shall be divided threefold; on this side, and that, The Companions of the right hand (ah! how joyful they will be!) The Companions of the left hand (oh! what misery to see!) Such, moreover, as of old time, loved the truth and taught it well, ‚ÄúSuch, moreover, as of old time,‚Äù &amp;c. These are the early prophets and holy teachers in all nations. The text of the Koran calls them ‚Äúthe leaders, the leaders!‚Äù that emphatic repetition denoting their dignity, and the assurance of their prominence in the final reward. First in faith, they shall be foremost in reward: the rest to Hell! But those souls attaining Allah,‚Äîah, the Gardens of good cheer Kept to lodge them! yea, besides the ‚ÄúFaithful,‚Äù many will be there. Lightly lying on soft couches, beautiful with broidered gold, Friends with friends, they shall be served by youths immortal, who will hold Akw√¢b, abareek‚Äîcups and goblets‚Äîbrimming with celestial wine‚Äî Wine which hurts nor head nor stomach‚Äîthis and fruits of Heaven which shine Bright, desirable; and rich flesh of what birds they relish best; Yea, and feasted, there shall soothe them damsels fairest, stateliest‚Äî Damsels having eyes of wonder, large black eyes like hidden pearls, Lulu-'l-makn√ªn, Allah grants them, for sweet love, those matchless girls. Never in that Garden hear they speech of folly, sin, or dread; Only ‚ÄúPeace‚Äù‚ÄîAs-Sal√¢m only‚Äîthat one word for ever said, ‚ÄúPeace! Peace! Peace!‚Äù and the Companions of the right hand (ah! those bowers!) They shall roam in thornless lote-groves, under mawztrees hung with flowers; ‚ÄúMawz-trees.‚Äù The original word talh' may mean either the plantain, or that acacia which has small round golden blossoms. Shaded, fed by flowing waters; near to fruits which never cloy, Hanging always ripe for plucking; and at hand the tender joy Of those maids of Heaven, the Houris: lo! to them We gave a birth Sale has a citation upon these privileged attributes of the Houris. ‚ÄúAllah has created them purposely of finer materials than the females of this world, and subject to none of those inconveniences which are natural to the sex. Some understand this passage of the beatified women; who, though they died old and ill-favoured, shall yet all be restored to their youth and beauty in Paradise.‚Äù Specially creating, lo! they are not as the wives of earth; Ever virginal and stainless, how so often they embrace, Always young and loved and loving these are; neither is there grace Like the grace and bliss the Black-eyed keep for you in Paradise, O Companions of the right hand! O ye others that were wise! Cf. Kor√¢n, lvi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Inevitable.‚Äù Giver of peace! when comes that day, Set us within Thy sight, we pray. 7Al-Maumin Al-Maumin! ‚ÄúFaithful,‚Äù fast, and just is He, And loveth such as live in verity. Ibn S√¢wa, Lord of Bahrein, in the field Captured a Sheikh, an Arab of the hills, Sayid-bin-Tayf; and the king's oath was passed That each tenth man of all the captives die Together with their chieftains, for the war Waxed fierce, and hearts of men were turned to flame. So led they Sayid forth before the camp At Azan; and a eunuch of the guard, ‚ÄúAt Azan.‚Äù The time of the call to prayer, and especially after the sun has begun to decline. Savage and black, stood with his haick uprolled Back to the armpit, and the scimetar's edge Naked to strike. But suddenly the king Inquired, ‚ÄúArt thou not he gave me to drink, Hunting gazelles, before the war began?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea, I am he!‚Äù said Sayid. Quoth the king, ‚ÄúAsk not thy life, but ask some other boon, That I may pay my debt.‚Äù Sayid replied, ‚ÄúDeath is not terrible to me who die Red with this unbelieving blood of thine; But there hath come a first-born in my tent; Fain would I see my son's face for a day, Before mine eyes are sealed. Lend me my life, To hold as something borrowed from thy hand, Which I will bring again.‚Äù ‚ÄúAy!‚Äù laughed the king, ‚ÄúIf one should answer for it with his own. Show me thy hostage!‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me stand his bond,‚Äù Spake one on whom the lot of mercy fell‚Äî Ish√¢k of Tayf, a gallant youth and fair‚Äî ‚ÄúI am his sister's son; bind ye my arms, And set free Sayid, that he ride at speed, And see his first-born's face, and come again.‚Äù So Sayid went free again, seeking his home. But in the camp they mocked that faithful friend, Saying, ‚ÄúLo! as a fool thou diest now, Staking thy life upon an Arab's word. Why should he haste, to abide the bitter blade? Will the scared jackal try the trap again; The hawk once limed return unto the snare? Cry to the desert-wind to turn and come, But call not Sayid.‚Äù Ish√¢k only smiled, And said,‚ÄúHe is a Muslim, he will come!‚Äù The days passed, Sayid came not, and they led The hostage forth, for Ish√¢k now must die; But still he smiled, saying, ‚ÄúTill sunset's hour Slay me not, for at sunset he will come.‚Äù So fell it, for the sun had touched the palms, And that black swordsman stood again in act To strike, when Sayid's white mare, galloping in, Drew steaming breath before the royal tent; And Sayid, leaping from the saddle, kissed His kinsman's eyes, and gently spake to all, ‚ÄúLabbayki! I am here.‚Äù ‚ÄúNever before was known a deed like this That one should stake his life upon a word; The other ride to death as to a bride. Live, and be friends of Ibn S√¢wa, but speak! Whence learned ye these high lessons?‚Äù Ish√¢k spake, ‚ÄúWe are believers in the book which saith, ‚ÄòFulfil your covenants, if ye covenant; For God is witness! break no word with men Which God hath heard; and surely He hears all.‚Äô‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xvi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Bee.‚Äù That verse the king bade write in golden script Over the palace gate; and he and his Followed the Faith. Ya! Allah-al-Maumin! In truthfulness of act be our faith seen. 8Al-Muhaimin Call Him Muhaimin,‚ÄúHelp in danger's hour,‚Äù Protector of the true who trust His power. The spider and the dove!‚Äîwhat thing is weak If Allah makes it strong? The spider and the dove!‚Äîif He protect, Fear thou not foemen's wrong. From Mecca to Medina fled our Lord, The horsemen followed fast; Into a cave to shun their murderous rage, Muhammad, weary, passed. Quoth Abu Bekr,‚ÄúIf they see, we die!‚Äù Quoth Ebn Foheir, ‚ÄúAway!‚Äù The guide Abdallah said,‚ÄúThe sand is deep, Those footmarks will betray.‚Äù Then spake our Lord,‚ÄúWe are not four, but Five; ‚ÄòHe Who protects‚Äô is here. Come! Al-Muhaimin now will blind their eyes; Enter, and have no fear.‚Äù The band drew nigh; one of the Koreish cried, ‚ÄúSearch ye out yonder cleft, I see the print of sandalled feet which turn Thither, upon the left!‚Äù But when they drew unto the cavern's mouth, Lo! at its entering-in, A ring-necked desert dove sate on her eggs; The mate cooed soft within. And right athwart the shadow of the cave A spider's web was spread; The creature hung upon her net at watch; Unbroken was each thread. ‚ÄúBy Thammuz' blood,‚Äù the unbelievers cried, ‚ÄúOur toil and time are lost; Where doves hatch and the spider spins her snare No foot of man hath crossed!‚Äù Thus did a desert bird and spider guard ‚ÄúAnd spider.‚Äù One of the S√ªras of the Kor√¢n, the 29th, is named after this insect. The blessed Prophet then; For all things serve their Maker and their God Better than thankless men. Allah-al-Muhaimin! shield and save Us, for his sake within that cave. 9Al-Hathim Say Al-Hathim! He is the Mighty One! Praise Him, and hear the great ‚ÄúVerse of the Throne.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Verse of the Throne.‚Äù This (which is often engraved on seal rings in the East) is so called from the word Koors√Æy, the ‚Äúchair or throne‚Äù of Allah, which occurs in the sublime passage cited. In the judgment of Muhammedans the ‚ÄúThrone-Verse‚Äù is one of the noblest portions of the Kor√¢n, surpassing in majesty of diction all other human compositions. It is taken from the 2d S√ªra, verse 256, and is rendered very exactly, as below, by Mr. Redhouse (to whose most learned and laborious article in the ‚ÄúJournal of the Royal Asiatic Society,‚Äù January 1880, my indebtedness has been extremely great):‚Äî ‚ÄúGod, save whom there is no God, is the Living, the Selfexisting One. Drowziness overcometh Him not, nor sleep. Unto Him belongeth whatever is in the heavens, and whatever is in the earth. Who is he that shall make intercession with Him, save by His permission? He knoweth whatever is before them, and whatever is behind them; and they comprehend not a single matter of His knowledge, save only that which He hath willed. His firmament spans the heavens and the earth, the preservation whereof doth not distress Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Supreme.‚Äù N.B.‚ÄîEach chapter of the Kor√¢n is called a S√ªra, a term signifying a course of bricks in a wall; and the S√ªras are divided into '√¢y√¢t, verses, or more literally ‚Äúsigns.‚Äù ‚ÄúAllah! there is none other God but He, The Living God, the Self-subsistent One; Weariness cometh not to Him, nor sleep; And whatso is belongs to Him alone In heaven and earth; who is it intercedes With Him, save if He please? He is aware What is before them and what after them, And they of all His knowledge nothing share Save what He will vouchsafe. His throne's foundation Sits splendid, high above the earth and sky, Which to sustain gives Him no meditation: Mightiest He is, Supreme in Majesty.‚Äù Ayatu-'l-Koors√Æy! this we Muslims grave On polished gem and painted architrave; But thou, write its great letters on thy heart, Lauding the Mighty One, whose work thou art. 10Al-Jabb√¢r The ‚ÄúAll-Compelling!‚Äù golden is that verse, Which doth His title‚ÄîAl-Jabb√¢r‚Äîrehearse. Sura the nine and fiftieth:‚ÄúFear ye God, O true believers! and let every soul Heed what it doth to-day, because to-morrow The same thing it shall find gone forward there To meet and make and judge it. Fear ye God, For He knows whatsoever deeds ye do. Be not as those who have forgotten Him, For they are those who have forgot themselves; They are the evil-doers: not for such, And for the heritors of Paradise, This S√ªra, 59, is known as the chapter ‚ÄúOf the Emigration.‚Äù Shall it be equal; Paradise is kept For those thrice blessed who have ears to hear. Lo! had we sent ‚Äúthe Book‚Äù unto Our hills, Our hills had bowed their crests in reverence, And opened to the heart their breasts of rock To take Heaven's message. Fear ye Him who knows Present, and Past, and Future: fear ye Him Who is the Only, Holy, Faithful Lord, Glorious and good, compelling to His will All things, for all things He hath made and rules. So rule, Al-Jabb√¢r; make our wills Bend, though more stubborn than the hills. 11Al-Mutakabbir Al-Mutakabbir! all the heavens declare His majesty, Who makes them what they are. Azar, of Abraham the father, spake The Muslim doctors call the scriptural Terah, the father of Abraham, by the name of Azar. This was also the title of the god of the planet Mars. Abraham's father is moreover styled Zarah in the Talmud, and Athar also, by Eusebius. Unto his son,‚ÄúCome! and thine offerings make Before the gods whose images divine In Nimr√ªd's carved and painted temple shine. Pay worship to the sun's great orb of gold; Adore the queen-moon's silver state; behold Ot√¢red, Moshtari, Sohayl, in their might, Those stars of glory, those high lords of light. These have we wrought, as fitteth gods alone, bronze and ivory and chiselled stone. Obey, as did thy sires, these powers of Heaven Which rule the world, throned in the circles seven.‚Äù But Abraham said,‚ÄúDid they not see the sun Sink and grow darkened, when the days were done; Did not the moon for them, too, wax and wane, That they should pay her worship, false and vain? Lo! all these stars have laws to rise and set‚Äî Ot√¢red, Moshtari, Sohayl‚Äîwilt thou yet Bid me praise gods who humbly come and go, Lights that a Greater Light hath kindled? No! I dare not bow the knee to one of these; My Lord is He who (past the sky man sees) Waxeth and waneth not, Unchanged of all, Him only ‚ÄòGod,‚Äô Him only ‚ÄòGreat,‚Äô I call.‚Äù Well spak'st thou, Friend of Allah! none ‚ÄúFriend of Allah.‚Äù The Muslims so denominate Abraham, Al-Khal√Æl. Is ‚Äúgreat‚Äù except the Greatest One. 12Al-Khalik Praise the ‚ÄúCreator!‚Äù He who made us live, Life everlasting unto us can give. By the glorious Book We have sent! do they wonder a warner is come Out from among themselves? do the misbelievers say ‚ÄúThis is a marvellous thing! what! when we are dead and dust To live! to arise! see now, this hope is a hope far away!‚Äù But what the grave shall consume, and what of the man it shall leave, We know, for a roll is with Us where each soul's order is set. Will they call the truth a lie when it cometh to them, and dwell Wrangling and foolish and fearful, confounding the matter? But yet The heaven is above them to see how fair We have builded its arch, Painted it golden and blue, finished it perfect and clear; And the earth how We spread it forth, and planted the mountains thereon; And made all the manifold trees and the beautiful blossoms appear. Memorials are these to the wise, and a message to him who repents; Moreover We drop from the clouds the blessing of water, the rain, Whereby the cool gardens do grow, and the palms soaring up to the sky With their date-laden branches and boughs, one over the other; and grain To nourish the children of men. Lo! thus We have quickened dead clay On the bosom of earth, and beneath her so, too, shall a quickening be. What! deem they it wearied God to create?‚Äîthat His power was spent? They are fools, and they darken their eyes to that which He willeth them see. We have fashioned man, and we know the thoughts of his innermost heart; We are closer to him than his blood, more near than the vein of his throat; At the right of ye all sits a watcher, a watcher sits at your left; And whatso each speaketh or thinketh, those two have known it and note. Al-Kh√¢lik! Fashioner Divine! Finish Thy work and make us Thine! 13Al-Bari Al-B√¢ri! Moulder of each form and frame, Pots praise the Potter, when we speak this name. Praise be to God, the Designer, Builder of earth and of Heaven! Fashioned His Angels He hath, making them messengers still; Two wings to some and four wings to some, and to some He hath given Six and eight silver wings, making what marvels He will. Verily mighty is He, and what He bestoweth of blessing This is suggested from S√ªra 35, the chapter ‚ÄúOf the Angels,‚Äù or ‚ÄúOf the Originator.‚Äù The Archangel Gabriel is said to have appeared to Muhammad, on the night of his journey to Heaven, having no less than three hundred pairs of wings! None can withhold; and none what He withholdeth can send; Children of men! remember the mercies of Allah towards ye, Is there a Maker save this, is there another such Friend? Nowhere another one, we see, Wondrous ‚ÄúArtificer!‚Äù like Thee. 14Al-Muzawwir Al-Muzawwir! the ‚ÄúFashioner!‚Äù say thus; Still lauding Him who hath compounded us. When the Lord would fashion men, Spake He in the Angels' hearing, ‚ÄúLo! Our will is there shall be On the earth a creature bearing Rule and royalty. To-day We will shape a man from clay.‚Äù Spake the Angels, ‚ÄúWilt Thou make Man who must forget his Maker, Working evil, shedding blood, Of Thy precepts the forsaker? But Thou knowest all, and we Celebrate Thy majesty.‚Äù Answered Allah, ‚ÄúYea! I know What ye know not of this making; Gabriel! Michael! Israfil! ‚ÄúMichael,‚Äù or Mik√¢'√Æl. The Archangel here named was especially the guardian of the Jews. The Israelites of Mecca told Muhammad that they would have received his Kor√¢n, if Michael instead of Gabriel had revealed it. Go down to the earth, and taking Seven clods of colours seven, Bring them unto Me in Heaven.‚Äù Then those holy Angels three Spread their pinions and descended; Seeking clods of diverse clay, That all colours might be blended; Yellow, tawny, dun, black, brown, White and red, as men are known. But the earth spake, sore afraid, ‚ÄúAngels! of my substance take not; Give me back my dust, and pray That the dread Creator make not Man, for he will sin, and bring Wrath on me and suffering.‚Äù Therefore empty-handed came Gabriel, Michael, Israfil, Saying,‚ÄúLord! Thy earth imploreth Man may never on her dwell; ‚ÄòHe will sin and anger thee, Give me back my clay!‚Äô cried she.‚Äù Spake the Lord to Azrael, ‚ÄúAzr√¢√´l.‚Äù The Archangel of Death. ‚ÄúGo thou, who of wing art surest. Tell my earth this shall be well; Bring those clods, which thou procurest From her bosom, unto Me; Shape them as I order thee.‚Äù Thus 'tis written how the Lord Fashioned Adam for His glory, Whom the Angels worshipped, All save Ibl√Æs; and this story Teacheth wherefore Azrael saith, ‚ÄúCome thou!‚Äù at man's hour of death. Allah! when he doth call us, take! We are such clay as Thou did'st make. 15Al-Ghaff√¢ Al-Ghaff√¢r, the ‚ÄúForgiver,‚Äù praise thereby Thy Lord who is so full of clemency. Once, it is written, Abraham, ‚ÄúGod's Friend,‚Äù ‚ÄúGod's Friend.‚Äù Vide note on page 35, line 15. Angered his Lord; for there had ridden in Across the burning yellow desert-flats An aged man, haggard with two days' drouth. The water-skin swung from his saddle-fork Wrinkled and dry; the dust clove to his lids, And clogged his beard; his parched tongue and black lips Moved to say, ‚ÄúGive me drink,‚Äù yet uttered nought; And that gaunt camel which he rode upon, Sank to the earth at entering of the camp, Too spent except to lay its neck along The sand, and moan. To whom when they had given The cool wet jar, asweat with diamond-drops Of sparkling life, that way-worn Arab laved The muzzle of his beast, and filled her mouth; Then westward turned with blood-shot, worshipping eyes, Pouring forth water to the setting orb: Next, would have drunk, but Abraham saw, and said, ‚ÄúLet not this unbeliever drink, who pours God's gift of water forth unto the sun, Which is but creature of the living Lord.‚Äù But while the man still clutched the precious jar, Striving to quaff, a form of grace drew nigh, Beauteous, majestic. If he came afoot, None knew, or if he glided from the sky. With gentle air he filled a gourd and gave The man to drink, and Abraham‚Äîin wrath That one should disobey him in his tents‚Äî Made to forbid; when full upon him smote Eyes of divine light, eyes of high rebuke‚Äî For this was Michael, Allah's messenger‚Äî ‚ÄúLo! God reproveth thee, thou Friend of God! Forbiddest thou gift of the common stream To this idolater, spent with the heat, Who, in his utmost need, watered his beast, And bowed the knee in reverence, ere he drank? Allah hath borne with him these threescore years, Bestowed upon him corn and wine, and made His household fruitful and his herds increase; And find'st thou not patience to pity him Whom God hath pitied, waiting for the end, Since none save He wotteth what end will come, Or who shall find the light. Thou art rebuked! Seek pardon! for thou hast much need to seek.‚Äù Thereat the Angel vanished, as he came; But Abraham, with humbled countenance, Kissed reverently the heathen's hand, and spake‚Äî Leading him to the chief seat in the tent‚Äî ‚ÄúGod pardon me, as He doth pardon thee!‚Äù Long-suffering Lord! ah, who should be Forgiven, if Thou wert as we? 16Al-Kahh√¢r Al-Kahh√¢r call Him‚Äî‚ÄúDominant,‚Äù the King, Who maketh, knoweth, ruleth everything. The ‚ÄúChapter of the Cattle:‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, vi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Cattle.‚Äù Heaven is whose, And whose is earth? Say Allah's, That did choose On His own might to lay the law of mercy. He, at the Resurrection, will not lose One of His own. What falleth, night or day, Falleth by His Almighty word alway. Wilt thou have any other Lord than Allah, Who is not fed, but feedeth all flesh? Say! For if He visit thee with woe, none makes The woe to cease save He; and if He takes Pleasure to send thee pleasure, He is Master Over all gifts; nor doth His thought forsake The creatures of the field, nor fowls that fly; They are ‚Äúa people‚Äù also:‚ÄúThese, too, I Have set,‚Äù the Lord saith, ‚Äúin My book of record; These shall be gathered to Me by and by.‚Äù With Him of all things secret are the keys; None other hath them, but He hath; and sees Whatever is in land, or air, or water, Each bloom that blows, each foam-bell on the seas. Nor is there any little hidden grain Swelling beneath the sod, nor in the main Any small fish or shell, nor of the earth Green things or dry things upon hill or plain, But these are written in th' unerring Book: And what ye did by day, and when ye took Your slumbers, and the last sleep; then to Him Is your return, and the account's there!‚Äîlook! Al-Kahh√¢r! All-embracing One! Our trust is fixed on Thee alone. 17Al-Wahh√¢b Praise ‚Äúthe Bestower:‚Äù unto all that live He giveth, and He loveth those who give. The Im√¢m √Çli, Lion of the Faith, Have ye not heard his giving? what he had The poor had, for he held his gold and goods As Allah's almoner. √Çli it was Who in the Mecca mosque at evening prayer‚Äî Being entreated by some needy one‚Äî Would not break off, yet would not let the man Ask him in vain for what he asked of God, Favour and aid; wherefore‚Äîamid the words‚Äî He drew his emerald, carved with Allah's praise, From his third finger, giving it; and prayed With face unturned. If he had pieces ten, He succoured five score; if one dinar, then Into ten dirhems he divided that, And fed ten ‚Äúpeople of the bench.‚Äù Our Lord ‚ÄúPeople of the bench.‚Äù This was the name given to the poor persons whom the Prophet sustained by alms every day, and who used to wait for his gifts, sitting upon the bench outside Muhammad's house at Medina. (On whom be peace!) in all men's hearing said, ‚ÄúThis is the Prince of Givers!‚Äù Once it fell, Being sore hungered in his house, he cried, ‚ÄúFatmeh! thou daughter of the Prophet of God, Find me to eat, if thou hast any food.‚Äù And Fatmeh said, ‚ÄúFather of Hassan! here Not a dry date is left‚Äînot one‚ÄîI swear By Him besides Whom is none other God; But in the corner of the tomb I laid Six silver akchas: take them, if thou wilt, And buy thee in the market food, and bring Fruits for our boys, Hassan and Hussain.‚Äù Thus √Çli departed. On his way he spied Two Mussulmans, of whom one rudely haled The other, crying, ‚ÄúPay thy debt, or come Unto the prison where the smiter waits.‚Äù And he who owed had nought, and wept amain, Sighing, ‚ÄúAlas the day!‚Äù But √Çli asked, ‚ÄúWhat is thy debt, my brother?‚Äù Then he moaned, ‚ÄúSix akchas, for the lack of which the chains Must load me.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù spake √Çli, ‚Äúthey are here; Take them and pay the man, and go in peace.‚Äù So went that debtor free, but √Çli came Empty in hand and belly home again Unto his door, where Fatmeh and the sons, Hassan and Hussain, seeing him approach, Ran joyous forth, crying, ‚ÄúHe bringeth us Dates now, and honey, and new camels' milk; Soon shall we feast.‚Äù But when they saw his cloth Hang void, and troubled eyes, and heard him say, ‚ÄúUpon my road I met a poorer man Who, for six akchas, should have borne the chains; To him I gave them, and I bring ye nought,‚Äù Then the lads wept; but Fatmeh smiled and spake: ‚ÄúWell hast thou done, O servant of the Lord! Weep not, ye sons of √Çli, though we fast; Who feedeth Allah's children, feasts His own: He, the ‚ÄòBestower,‚Äô will provide for us.‚Äù But √Çli turned, heart-sore because the boys Lacked meat, and Fatmeh's lovely eyes were sunk Hollow with hunger. ‚ÄúI will go,‚Äù thought he, ‚ÄúUnto the blessed Prophet, for, if one Be burdened with a thousand woes, his word Dismisses them and makes the sorrow joy.‚Äù So bent he mournful steps thither, to tell The Lord Muhammad of this strait, when‚Äîlo! An Arab in mid path encountered him, Of noble bearing, with a chieftain's mien, Leading a riding-camel by her string, Black, with full teeth, the best beast ever foaled. ‚ÄúBuy Wurdah!‚Äîbuy my desert rose,‚Äù quoth he; ‚ÄúOne hundred akchas make her thine, so thou Shalt own the best in Hedjaz, or at choice Sell her for double money.‚Äù √Çli said, ‚ÄúThe beast is excellent! fain would I buy, But have not in my scrip thy price.‚Äù ‚ÄúGo to,‚Äù The Sheikh replied; ‚Äútake her and bring thy gold, When Allah pleaseth, to the western gate; I will await thee.‚Äù √Çli nodded; took The nose-string, turning to the left to seek The camel-merchants that should buy the beast; Whom at the very entry of the khan Another Arab in the desert garb, Lordly and gracious like his fellow, met, And quick saluted, saying, ‚ÄúPeace with thee! God send thee favour! wilt thou sell me now Thy riding-camel with the great stag-eyes? Here be three hundred akchas counted down, Silver and gold, good money! Such an one I sought, but found not, till I saw thee here.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf thou wilt buy,‚Äù quoth √Çli, ‚Äúbe it so!‚Äù And thereupon that Bedawee counted out Dinars and dirhems‚Äîlittle suns and moons Of glittering gold and silver‚Äîin his cloth, And took the beast; but √Çli, with one piece Bought food and fruits, and, hastening home again, Heard his lads laugh with joy to see the store Poured forth;‚Äîwhite cakes and dates and amber grapes‚Äî And smiled himself to mark Fatmeh's soft eyes Gladden; then, having eaten, blessed the Lord, Giver of gifts, ‚ÄúBestower.‚Äù So, once more Made he to go unto the western gate To pay his seller; but upon the street The Prophet met him. Lightly smiled our Lord, (On whom be comfort!) lightly questioned he, Saying, ‚ÄúO √Çli! who was he did sell Thy riding-camel, and to whom didst thou Sell her again?‚Äù Quoth √Çli, ‚ÄúOnly God Knoweth, except thou knowest!‚Äù Spake our Lord, ‚ÄúYea, but I know! that was great Gabriel, Chief messenger of Heaven, from whom thou bought'st; And he to whom thou sold'st was Israfil, His heavenly fellow; and that beast did come Forth from the pleasure-fields of Paradise, And thither back is gone; for‚Äîlook! my son, Allah hath recompensed thee fifty times The goodly deed thou didst, giving thine all To free the weeping debtor. Oh, He sees And measures and bestows; but what is kept, Beyond gifts here, for kindly hearts that love, God only wotteth, and the Eternal Peace.‚Äù Bestower! grant us grace to see Our gain is what we lose for Thee. 18Al-Razz√¢k Al-Razz√¢k! the ‚ÄúProvider!‚Äù thus again Praise Him who, having formed thee, doth sustain. By the high dawn, When the light of the sun is strong! By the thick night, When the darkness is deep and long! He hath not forsook thee, nor hated! By His mercies, I say, The life which will come shall be better Than the life of to-day. In the latter days The Lord thy ‚ÄúProvider‚Äù shall give; The very remarkable S√ªra quoted here, entitled sometimes ‚ÄúThe Brightness,‚Äù came to the prophet thus:‚Äî ‚ÄúIt is related that no revelation having been vouchsafed to Muhammad for several days, in answer to some questions put to him by the Koreish, because he had confidently promised to resolve them the next day, without adding the exception, if it please God, or because he had repulsed an importunate beggar, or else because a dead puppy lay under his seat, or for some other reason; his enemies said that God had left him: whereupon this chapter was sent down for his consolation.‚Äù When thou knowest His gift Thou wilt not ask rather to live; Look back! thou wert friendless and frameless, He made thee from nought; Look back! thou wert blinded and wandering, To the light thou art brought! Consider! shall Allah forego thee Since thus He hath wrought? Cf. Kor√¢n, xciii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Forenoon.‚Äù The favour of thy Lord perpend, And praise His mercies without end. 19Al-F√¢tta`h Al-Fatt√¢'h! praise the ‚ÄúOpener!‚Äù and recite The marvels of that ‚ÄúJourney of the Night.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xvii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Night Journey.‚Äù Our Lord Muhammad lay upon the hill Saf√¢, whereby the holy city stands, Asleep, wrapped in a robe of camels' wool. Dark was the night‚Äîthat Night of grace‚Äîand still; When all the seven spheres, by God's commands, Opened unto him, splendid and wonderful! For Gabriel, softly lighting, touched his side, Saying, ‚ÄúRise, thou enwrapped one! come and see The things which be beyond. Lo! I have brought ‚ÄúThe Journey of the Night.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is a dispute,‚Äù writes Sale, ‚Äúamong the Muhammedan divines, whether their Prophet's night-journey was really performed by him corporally, or whether it was only a dream or vision. Some think the whole was no more than a vision; and allege an express tradition of Mo√¢wiyah, one of Muhammad's successors, to that purpose. Others suppose he was carried bodily to Jerusalem, but no farther; and that he ascended thence to Heaven in spirit only. But the received opinion is, that it was no vision, but that he was actually transported in the body to his journey's end; and if any impossibility be objected, they think it a sufficient answer to say, that it might easily be effected by an omnipotent agent.‚Äù Borak, the horse of swiftness; mount and ride!‚Äù Milk-white that steed was, with embroidery Of pearls and emeralds in his long hair wrought. Hooved like a mule he was, with a man's face; His eyes gleamed from his forelock, each a star Of lucent hyacinth; the saddle-cloth Was woven gold, which priceless work did grace: The lightning goeth not so fast or far As those broad pinions which he fluttered forth. One heel he smote on Saf√¢, and one heel On Sinai‚Äîwhere the dint is to this day. Next at Jerusalem he neighed. Our Lord, Descending with th' Archangel there, did kneel Making the midnight prayer; afterwards they Tethered him to the Temple by a cord. ‚ÄúAscend!‚Äù spake Gabriel; and behold! there fell Out of the sky a ladder bright and great, Whereby, with easy steps, on radiant stairs, They mounted‚Äîpast our earth and heaven and hell‚Äî To the first sphere, where Adam kept the gate, Which was of vaporous gold and silvery squares. Here thronged the lesser Angels: some took charge To fill the clouds with rain and speed them round, And some to tend live creatures; for what's born Hath guardians there in its own shape: a large Beauteous white cock crowed matins, at the sound Cocks in a thousand planets hailed the morn. Unto the second sphere by that white slope Ascended they, whereof Noah held the key; And two-fold was the throng of Angels here; But all so dazzling glowed its fretted cope, Burning with beams, Muhammad could not see What manner of celestial folk were there. The third sphere lay a thousand years beyond If thou should'st journey as the sun-ray doth, But in one F√¢tihah clomb they thitherward. ‚Äî‚ÄúOne F√¢tihah.‚Äù The name of the opening prayer of Muhammedans. David and Solomon in union fond Ruled at the entrance, keeping Sabaoth Of ceaseless joy. The void was paven hard With paven work of rubies‚Äîif there be Jewels on earth to liken unto them Which had such colour as no goldsmith knows‚Äî And here a vast Archangel they did see, ‚ÄúFaithful of God‚Äù his name, whose diadem Was set with peopled stars; wherefrom arose Lauds to the glory of God, filling the blue With lovely music, as rose-gardens fill A land with essences; and young stars, shaking Tresses of lovely light, gathered and grew Under his mighty plumes, departing still Like ships with crews and treasure, voyage-making. So came they to the fourth sphere, where there sate Enoch, who never tasted death; and there Behind its portal awful Azrael writes; The shadow of his brows compassionate Made night across all worlds; our Lord felt fear, Marking the stern eyes and the hand which smites. For always on a scroll he sets the names Of new-born beings, and from off the scroll He blotteth who must die; and holy tears Roll down his cheeks, recording all our shames And sins and penalties; while of each soul Monker and Nakir reckon the arrears. ‚Äî‚ÄúMonker and Nak√Ær‚Äù are the two Angels who conduct ‚Äúthe examination of the Tomb.‚Äù They come to a man directly he is laid in his grave, and catechise him as to his faith. If he repeats quickly and gladly the formula of Isl√¢m, they cause him to repose in peace; but if he is uncertain or heterodox, they belabour him with iron clubs, till his cries are so bitter that they are heard all through the earth, except by men and Djins. Then the two black Ministers press the clay down upon the corpse, and leave it to be wasted and consumed till the time of resurrection. Next, at the fifth sphere's entry, they were 'ware Of a door built in sapphire, having graven Letters of flashing fire, the faith unfolding, ‚ÄúThere is no God save God.‚Äù Aaron sate there Guarding the ‚Äúregion of the wrath of Heaven;‚Äù And Israfil behind, his trumpet holding, His trumpet holding‚Äîwhich shall wake the dead And slay the living‚Äîall his cheek puffed out, Bursting to blow; for none knows Allah's time, Nor when the word of judgment shall be said: And darts, and chains of flame, lay all around, Terrible tortures for th' ungodly's crime. When to the sixth sphere passed they, Moses sped Its bars of chrysoprase, and kissed our Lord, And spake full sweet, ‚ÄúProphet of Allah! thou More souls of Ismael's tribes to truth hast led, Than I of Isaak's.‚Äù Here the crystal sword Of Michael gave the light they journeyed through. But at the seventh sphere that light which shone Hath not an earthly name, nor any voice Can tell its splendour, nay, nor any ear Learn, if it listened; only he alone Who saw it, knows how there th' elect rejoice, Isa, and Ibrahim, and the souls most dear. And he, the glorious regent of that sphere, Had seventy thousand heads; and every head As many countenances; and each face As many mouths; and in each mouth there were Tongues seventy thousand, whereof each tongue said, Ever and ever, ‚ÄúPraise to Allah! praise!‚Äù Here, at the bound, is fixed that lotus-tree Sedra, which none among the Angels pass; And not great Gabriel's self might farther wend: Yet, led by presences too bright to see, Too high to name, on paths like purple glass Our Lord Muhammad journeyed to the end. Alone! alone! through hosts of Cherubim Crowding the infinite void with whispering vans, From splendour unto splendour still he sped; Across the ‚ÄúLake of Gloom‚Äù they ferried him, And then the ‚ÄúSea of Glory:‚Äù mortal man's Heart cannot hold the wonders witness√´d. So to the ‚ÄúRegion of the Veils‚Äù he came, Which shut all times off from eternity, The bars of being where thought cannot reach: Ten thousand thousand are they, walls of flame Lambent with loveliness and mystery, Ramparts of utmost heaven, having no breach. Then he saw God! our Prophet saw the Throne!‚Äî O Allah! let these weak words be forgiven!‚Äî Thou, the Supreme, ‚Äúthe Opener,‚Äù spake at last; The Throne! the Throne! he saw;‚Äîour Lord alone! Saw it and heard!‚Äîbut the verse falls from heaven Like a poised eagle, whom the lightnings blast. And Gabriel waiting by the tree he found; And Borak, tethered to the Temple porch; He loosed the horse, and 'twixt its wings ascended. One hoof it smote on Zion's hallowed ground, One upon Sinai; and the day-star's torch Was not yet fading when the journey ended. Al-F√¢tt√¢'h! ‚ÄúOpener!‚Äù we say Thy name, and worship Thee alway. 20Al-`Alim Al-'Alim! the ‚ÄúAll-Knower!‚Äù by this word Praise Him Who sees th' unseen, and hears th' unheard. If ye keep hidden your mind, if ye declare it aloud, Equally God hath perceived, equally known is each thought: If on your housetops ye sin, if in dark chambers ye shroud, Equally God hath beheld, equally judgment is wrought. He, without listing, doth know how many breathings ye make; Numbereth the hairs of your heads, wotteth the beats of your blood: Heareth the feet of the ant when she wanders by night in the brake; Counteth the eggs of the snake and the cubs of the wolf in the wood. Mute the Moakkib√¢t These are the ‚ÄúSuccessors,‚Äù or Angels of Record, who relieve each other in the duty of registering human actions, &amp;c. sit this side and that side of men, One on the right noting good, and one on the left noting ill; Each hath those Angels beside him who write with invisible pen Whatso he doeth, or sayeth, or thinketh, recording it still. Vast is the mercy of God, and when a man doeth aright, Glad is the right-hand Angel, and setteth it quick on the roll; Ten times he setteth it down in letters of heavenly light, For one good deed ten deeds, and a hundred for ten on the scroll. But when one doeth amiss the right-hand Angel doth lay His palm on the left-hand Angel and whispers, ‚ÄúForbear thy pen! Peradventure in seven hours the man may repent him and pray; At the end of the seventh hour, if it must be, witness it then.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xiii. chapter ‚ÄúOf thunder.‚Äù Al-'Alim! Thou Who knowest all, With hearts unveiled on Thee we call. 21Al-Kabiz Yakbuzu wa Yabsutu! heaven and hell He closeth and uncloseth‚Äîand doth well! Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Cow.‚Äù In gold and silk and robes of pride An evil-hearted monarch died; Pampered and arrogant his soul Quitted the grave. His eyes did roll Hither and thither, deeming some In that new world should surely come To lead his spirit to a seat Of state, for kingly merit meet. What saw he? 'twas a hag so foul There is no Afrit, Djin, or Ghoul With countenance as vile, or mien As fearful, and such terrors seen In the fierce voice and hideous air, Blood-dripping hands and matted hair. ‚ÄúAllah have mercy!‚Äù cried the king, ‚ÄúWhence and what art thou, hateful thing?‚Äù ‚ÄúDost thou not know‚Äîwho gav'st me birth?‚Äù Replied the form;‚Äúthy sins on earth In me embodied thus behold. I am thy wicked work! unfold Thine arms and clasp me, for we two In hell must live thy sentence through.‚Äù Then with a bitter cry, 'tis writ, The king's soul passed unto the pit. Al-Kabiz! so He bars the gate Against the unregenerate. 22Al-B√¢sit Yet He who shuts the gate, just wrath to wreak, Unbars it, full of mercy, to the meek. There died upon the Miraj night, A man of Mecca, Amru hight; Faithful and true, patient and pure, Had been his years; he did endure In war five spear-wounds, and in peace Long journeying for his tribe's increase; And ever of his gains he gave Unto poor brethren‚Äîkind as brave: But these forsook, and age and toil Drained the strong heart as flames drink oil; Till, lone and friendless, grey and spent‚Äî A thorn-tree's shadow for his tent, And desert sand for dying-bed‚Äî Amru the camel-man lay dead. What is it that the 'Had√Æth saith? ‚Äú'Had√Æth.‚Äù The traditional sayings which supplement the Kor√¢n. Even while the true eyes glazed in death, And the warm heart wearied, and beat The last drum of its long defeat, An Angel, lighting on the sand, Took Amru's spirit by the hand, And gently spake,‚ÄúDear brother, come! A sore road thou didst journey home; But life's dry desert thou hast passed, And Zem-Zem sparkles nigh at last.‚Äù ‚ÄúZem-Zem.‚Äù This is the holy well at Mecca, within the sacred precincts, believed to be that very spring which was revealed to Hagar when she fled with Ishmael. Then with swift flight those twain did rise Unto the gates of Paradise, Which opened, and the Angel gave A golden granate, saying,‚ÄúCleave This fruit, my brother!‚Äù But its scent So heavenly seemed, and so intent, So rapt was Amru, to behold The great fruit's rind of blushing gold And emerald leaves‚Äîhe dared not touch, Murmuring,‚ÄúO M√¢lik! 'tis too much That I am here, with eyes so dim, And grace all fled.‚Äù Then bade they him Gaze in the stream which glided stilly, 'Mid water-roses and white lily, Under those lawns and smiling skies That make delight in Paradise; When, lo! the presence imaged there Was of such comeliness, no peer Among those glorious Angels stood To Amru, mirrored in the flood. ‚ÄúI! is it I?‚Äù he cried in gladness, ‚ÄúAm I so changed from toil and sadness?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis was thy hidden self,‚Äù replied The Angels.‚ÄúSo shalt thou abide By our bright river evermore; And in that fair fruit's secret core‚Äî Which on the Tree of Life hath grown‚Äî Another marvel shall be shown. Ah, happy Amru! cleave!‚Äù He clove:‚Äî Sweet miracle of bliss and love! Forth from the pomegranate there grew, As from its bud a rose breaks through, A lovely, stately, lustrous maid, Whose black orbs long silk lashes shade, Whose beauty was so rich to see No verse can tell it worthily; Nor is there found in any place One like her for the perfect grace Of soft arms wreathed and ripe lips moving In accents musical and loving; For thus she spake:‚ÄúPeace be to thee, My Amru!‚Äù Then, with quick cry, he: ‚ÄúWho art thou, blessed one? what name Wearest thou? teach my tongue to frame This worship of my heart.‚Äù Said she, ‚ÄúThy good deeds gave me being: see, If in my beauty thou hast pleasure, How the Most High doth truly treasure Joy for his servants. Murzich I‚Äî She that doth love and satisfy‚Äî And I am made by Allah's hand Of ambergris and musk, to stand Beside thee, soothing thee, and tending In comfort and in peace unending.‚Äù So hand in hand, 'tis writ, they went To those bright bowers of high content. Al-B√¢sit! thus He opens wide His mercies to the justified. 23Al-Kh√¢fiz Al-Kh√¢fiz! the ‚ÄúAbaser!‚Äù praise hereby Him Who doth mock at earthly majesty. Heard ye of Nimr√ªd? Cities fell before him; Shinar, from Accad to the Indian Sea, His garden was; as God, men did adore him; Queens were his slaves, and kings his vassalry. Eminent on his car of carven brass, Through foeman's blood nave-deep he drave his wheel; And not a lion in the river-grass Could keep its shaggy fell from Nimr√ªd's steel. This legend of Nimr√ªd is alluded to in S√ªra 21 of the Kor√¢n, entitled the ‚ÄúChapter of Prophets.‚Äù But he scorned Allah, schemed a tower to invade Him; Dreamed to scale Heaven, and measure might with God; Heaped high the foolish clay wherefrom We made him, And built thereon his seven-fold house of the clod. Therefore, the least Our messengers among, We sent;‚Äîa grey gnat dancing in the reeds: Into his ear she crept, buzzing,‚Äîand stung. So perished mighty Nimr√ªd and his deeds. O Thou Abaser of all pride! Mighty Thou art, and none beside. 24Ar-Rafi Ar-R√¢fi! the ‚ÄúExalter!‚Äù laud Him so Who loves the humble and lifts up the low. Whom hath He chosen for His priests and preachers, Lords who were eminent, or men of might? Nay, but consider how He seeks His teachers, Hidden, like rubies unaware of light. Ur of the Chaldees! what chance to discover Th' elect of Heaven in Azar's leathern tent? But Allah saw His child, and friend, and lover, And Abraham was born, and sealed, and sent. The babe committed to th' Egyptian water! Knew any that the tide of Nilus laved The hope of Israel there? yet Pharaoh's daughter Found the frail ark, and so was Moses saved. Low lies the Syrian town behind the mountain Where Mary, meek and spotless, knelt that morn, And saw the splendid Angel by the fountain, And heard his voice,‚ÄúLord Isa shall be born!‚Äù Nay, and Muhammad (blessed may he be!), Abdallah's and Am√Ænah's holy son, Whom black Hal√Æmah nursed, the Bedawee, ‚ÄúBlack Hal√Æmah.‚Äù The Prophet was suckled by a Bedouin foster-nurse. Where lived a lonelier or a humbler one? Think how he led the camels of Khad√Æjah, Poor, but illumined by the light of Heaven; Mightier than Noah, or Enoch, or Elijah, Our holy Prophet, to Arabia given. Man knew him not, wrapped in his cloth, and weeping Lonely on Hir√¢ all that wondrous night; ‚ÄúHir√¢.‚Äù A wild and solitary mountain near Mecca. But Allah for His own our Lord was keeping:‚Äî ‚ÄúRise, thou enwrapped one!‚Äù Gabriel spake,‚Äúand write.‚Äù Save God there is none high at all, Nor any low whom He doth call. 25Al-Muhizz Al-Muhizz! by this title celebrate The ‚ÄúHonourer‚Äù Whose favour maketh great. Say ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù say ‚ÄúLord of all! Kingdoms and kings Thou makest and unmakest, This one Thou takest, that one Thou forsakest; Alike are great and small; Into Thy hand they fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Thy dread hand they rest; Their nights and days, their waking and their sleeping, Their birth, and life, and death lie in Thy keeping; ‚ÄòBe thus‚Äô to each Thou say'st, And thus to be is best, Though it seem good or ill. Isl√¢m!‚Äîto Thee our souls we do resign, Turning our faces to the blessed shrine; Seeking no honour still Save from Thy will.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù Al-Muhizz! only this we pray To learn Thy will and to obey. 26Al-Muz√Æl O, Al-Muz√Æl! what if it be Thy will, Having made man, to lead him unto ill? Saith the Perspicuous Book:‚ÄúAll things which be are of God; Neither, except by His word, falleth a leaf to the ground; If He will open He openeth, and whom He hath blinded He blindeth, Leading, misleading; to none liable, blameable, bound.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù Saith the Perspicuous Book:‚ÄúTied on the neck of a man Hangeth the scroll of his fate, not a line to be gainsaid or grudged; When the trumpet of Israfil thunders, the Angels will show it and say, Read there what thine own deeds have written; thyself by thyself shall be judged.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xvii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Night Journey.‚Äù Wilt thou be wiser than God Who knoweth beginning and end? Wilt thou be juster than He whose balance is turned by a sigh? He sayeth,‚ÄúIt shall not be equal for the doers of right and of wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt shall not be equal,‚ÄùHe sayeth,‚Äúfor them that accept and deny.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, eodem loce. Al-Muz√Æl! lead us not astray! Teach us to find the perfect way. 27As-Sam√Æ'h As-Sam√Æ'h! O Thou Hearer! none can be So far, his crying doth not come to Thee. Writes in his Mesnev√Æ, Jel√¢lu-'d-deen: There came a man of Yaman, poor and old, To Mecca, making pilgrimage; untaught, A shepherd of the hills. Humble he trod The six mik√¢t, the stages of the Hadj; ‚ÄúMik√¢t.‚Äù These are the last six stages on the journey to Mecca. The i'hr√¢m, or ‚Äúgarb of sancitity,‚Äù consists of two wrappers without seams, one bound round the waist, the other passed over the shoulders. The taw√¢f is the seven-fold circuit of the Kaabah, made three times quickly, and four times slowly, by all pilgrims. Humbly indued the ihr√¢m, garb of faith Which hath no seam; made due ablutions, kissed The black stone; then three times with hastening feet Circled the Kaabah, and four times paced With slackened gait the taw√¢f, as is due, (For such observances the Mollah taught). But, when he bowed before the Holy Place, Thus brake his soul from him, knowing no prayer, Full of God's love, though ignorant of God: ‚ÄúO Master! O my Sheikh! where tarriest Thou? Show me Thy face that I may worship Thee, May toil Thy servant, which I am in heart: Ah! let me sew Thy shoes, anoint Thine hair, Wash Thy soiled robes, and serve Thee daily up My she-goats' freshest milk‚ÄîI love Thee so! Where hidest Thou, that I may kiss Thine hand, Chafe Thy dear feet, and ere Thou takest rest‚Äî In the gold sky, beside Thy sun, belike, Among the soft-spread fleeces of Thy clouds‚Äî Sweep out Thy chamber, O my joy, my King!‚Äù Which hearing, they who kept the shrine, incensed. Had haled him to the gateway, crying,‚ÄúDog! What blasphemy is this thou utterest, Saying such things of Him That hath no needs Of nourishment, nor clothing, nor repose, Nor hands, nor feet, nor any form or frame; That thou, base keeper of the silly herd, Shouldst proffer service to the All-Powerful? Meet were it that we stoned thee dead with stones, Who art accursed and injurious. Begone! these holy walls are not for thee.‚Äù So, sore abashed, that shepherd made to go, Silent and weeping; but our Prophet marked, And with mild eyes smiled on the man; then spake To those that drave him forth:‚ÄúYe, when ye pray Outside this holy place, in distant lands, Whither turn ye your faces?‚Äù Each one said, ‚ÄúUnto the Kaabah.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd when ye pray, Within the blessed precincts, pilgrims here, Which way lies Mecca?‚Äù ‚ÄúAll is sacred here,‚Äù They answered,‚Äúand it matters nought which way.‚Äù ‚ÄúLo! now ye reason well,‚Äù replied our Lord; ‚ÄúInside the Kaabah it matters nought Whither men turn; and in the secret place Of perfect love for God, words are as breath And will is all. This simple shepherd's prayer Came unto Allah's ears clearer than yours, Nathless his ignorance, because his heart‚Äî Not tongue, not understanding‚Äîuttered it. Make room for God's poor lover nighest me; Good fellowship hath any man with him To whom Heaven's ear as quick inclines itself As doth a mother's when her babe lisps love.‚Äù Then were they sore asham√´d in that hour. Hearer of hearts! As-Sam√Æh! so Our iove inspire, and Thine bestow. 28Al-Baz√Ær Al-Baz√Ær! O Thou Seer! great and small Live in Thy vision, which embraceth all. Were it one wasted seed of water-grass, Blown by the wind, or buried in the sand, He seeth and ordaineth if it live; Were it a wild bee questing honey-buds, He seeth if she find, and how she comes On busy winglets to her hollow tree. The seeing of His eyes should not be told, Though all the reeds in all the earth were cut To writing-sticks, and all the seven seas Were seven times multiplied, flowing with ink, And seventy Angels wrote. He beholds all Which was, or is, or will be: yea, with Him Is present vision of five secret things: The Day of Judgment; and the times of rain; The child hid in the womb‚Äîits quickening, And whether male or female;‚Äîwhat will fall To-morrow (as ye know what did befall Yesterday); and where every man shall die. Cf. Kor√¢n, xxxi. chapter ‚ÄúOf Lokman.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere every man shall die.‚Äù Al Beidh√¢wi Presenteth how there sate with Solomon A prince of India, and there passed them by Azrael, Angel of Death, on shadowy plumes; With great eyes gazing earnestly, as one Who wonders, gazing. And, because the prince Sate with the king, he saw what the king saw, The Djins and Angels, and saw Azrael Fixing on him those awful searching eyes. ‚ÄúWhat name, I pray thee, wears yon messenger?‚Äù So asked he of the king; and Solomon Made answer,‚ÄúIt is Azrael, who calls The souls of men.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe seemed,‚Äù whispered the prince, ‚ÄúTo have an errand unto me;‚Äîbid now That one among thy demon ministers Waft me, upon the swiftest wing that beats, To India, for I fear him.‚Äù Solomon Issued command, and a swift Djin sprang forth Bearing the prince aloft, so that he came To Coromandel, ere the fruit‚Äîwhich fell Out of the fig‚Äîhad touched the marble floor. Thereupon Azrael said to Solomon, ‚ÄúI looked thus earnestly upon the man In wonder, for my Lord spake,‚ÄòTake his soul In India;‚Äô yet behold he talked with thee Here in Jud√¶a! Now, see! he hath gone There where it was commanded he should die.‚Äù Then followed Azrael. In that hour the prince Died of a hurt, sitting in India. With Thee, Lord, be the time and place, So that we die in Thy dear grace. 29Al-H√¢kim Al-H√¢kim! think upon the Day of Doom, And fear ‚Äúthe Judge‚Äù before Whom all must come. When the sun is withered up, And the stars from Heaven roll; When the mountains quake, And ye let stray your she-camels, gone ten months in foal; ‚ÄúYe let stray your she-camels.‚Äù Nothing is held more valuable among the goods of an Arab than a shecamel near to foaling. When wild beasts flock With the people and the cattle In terror, in amazement, And the seas boil and rattle; And the dead souls For their bodies seek; And the child vilely slain Is bid to speak, Being asked,‚ÄúWho killed thee, little maid? ‚ÄúWho killed thee, little maid?‚Äù This alludes to the ancient practice of infanticide among the Arabs, which Muhammad strenuously denounced. Tell us his name!‚Äù While the books are unsealed, And crimson flame Flayeth the skin of the skies, And Hell breaks ablaze; And Paradise Opens her beautiful gates to the gaze;‚Äî Then shall each soul Know the issues of the whole, And the balance of its scroll. Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Folding Up.‚Äù Shall We swear by the stars Which fade away? By the Night drowned in darkness, By the dead Day? We swear not! a true thing is this; It standeth sure, He saw it and he heard, and Our word ‚ÄúHe saw it and he heard.‚Äù Alluding to the Prophet and his journey to Heaven. Will endure! When the sky cleaves asunder, And the stars Are scattered; and in thunder All the bars Of the seas burst, and all the graves are emptied Like chests upturned, Each soul shall see her doings, done and undone, And what is earned. The smiting, the smiting Of that Day! The horror, the splendour, Who shall say? Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Cleaving Asunder.‚Äù The Day when none shall answer for his brother; The Day which is with God, and with none other. Al-H√¢kim! Judge! Save by Thy power, Who might abide that awful hour? 30Al-H√¢dil Al-H√¢dil! O ‚ÄúJust Lord!‚Äù we magnify Thy righteous Law, which shall the whole world try. God will roll up, when this world's end approacheth, The broad blue spangled hangings of the sky, Even as As-Sigill A name of the Angel of Registration. rolleth up his record, And seals and binds it when a man doth die. Then the false worshippers, and what they follow, Will to the pit, like ‚Äústones of hell,‚Äù descend; But true believers shall hear Angels saying, ‚ÄúThis is your day; be joyous without end.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xxi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Prophets.‚Äù In that hour dust shall lie on many faces, And many faces shall be glad and bright; Cf. Kor√¢n, Ixxx. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Frown.‚Äù Ye who believe, trust and be patient always, Until God judges, for He judges right. Cf. Kor√¢n, x. chapter ‚ÄúOf Jonas.‚Äù Give us to pass before Thy throne Among the number of Thine own! 31Al-Lat√Æf Dread is His wrath, but boundless is His grace, Al-Lat√Æf! Lord! show us Thy ‚Äúfavouring‚Äù face! Most quick to pardon sins is He: Who unto God draws near One forward step, God taketh three To meet, and quit his fear. If ye will have of this world's show, God grants, while Angels weep; If ye for Paradise will sow, Right noble crops ye reap. Cf. Kor√¢n, xlii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Counsel.‚Äù Ah, Gracious One, we toil to reap: The soil is hard, the way is steep! 32Al-Khab√Ær Al-Khab√Ær! Thou Who art ‚Äúaware‚Äù of all, By this name also for Thy grace we call. One morning in Medina walked our Lord Among the tombs: glad was the dawn, and broad On headstones and on footstones sunshine lay; Earth seemed so fair, 'twas hard to be away. ‚ÄúO people of the graves!‚Äù Muhammad said, ‚ÄúPeace be with you! Your caravan of dead Hath passed the defile, and we living ones Forget what men ye were, of whom the sons, And what your merchandise and where ye went; But Allah knows these things! Be ye content Since Allah is ‚Äòaware.‚Äô Ah! God forgive Those that are dead, and us who briefly live.‚Äù Yea! pardon, Lord, since Thou dost know To-morrow, now, and long ago. 33Al-H√¢l√Æm Al-H√¢l√Æm! ‚ÄúClement‚Äù is our Lord above; Magnify Allah by this name of love. Ye know the ant that creeps upon the fig, The dharra, made so small, Until she moveth in the purple seeds She is not seen at all. If, on the judgment-day, holding the scales‚Äî When all the trial's done‚Äî The Angel of the Balance crieth, ‚ÄúLord! The good deeds of this one Outweigh his evil deeds, justly assessed, By half one dharra's weight;‚Äù Allah will say, ‚ÄúMultiply good to him, And open Heaven's gate!‚Äù Not if thy work be worth a date-stone's skin Shall it be overpast; Thus it is written in the Sacred Book, Cf. Kor√¢n, iv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Women.‚Äù Thus will it be at last. Faithful and just, Al-Hal√Æm! we Take refuge in Thy clemency. 34Al-`Aziz Al-'Aziz! ‚ÄúStrong and Sovereign‚Äù God, Thy hand Is over all Thy works, holding command. Maker of all ye truly call the Strong and Sovereign One, Yet have ye read that verse which saith whereto His work was done? Open ‚Äúthe Book,‚Äù and, heedful, look what weighty words are given (The Chapter of Al-Akh√¢f) concerning Earth and Heaven. ‚ÄúAl-Akh√¢f‚Äù is the plural of Hekf, and signifies ‚Äúlands which lie in a winding or narrow boundary,‚Äù specially applied to a district in the province of Hadramaut. ‚ÄúThe Heavens and earth,‚Äù Al-Akh√¢f saith, ‚Äúand whatso is between, Think ye that We made these to be, and then‚Äînot to have been? Think ye We fashioned them in jest, without their times, and plan, And purpose? Nay! accurst are they who judge of God by man.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xlvi. chapter ‚ÄúOf Al-Akh√¢f.‚Äù O Higher, Wiser, than we know, Let not Thy creatures judge Thee so. 35Al-Gh√¢fir He is the ‚ÄúPardoner,‚Äù and his Scripture hath‚Äî ‚ÄúParadise is for them that check their wrath, And pardon sins; so Allah doth with souls; He loveth best him who himself controls.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù Know ye of Hassan's slave? Hassan the son Of √Çli. In the camp at Ras-al-hadd He made a banquet unto sheikhs and lords, Rich dressed and joyous; and a slave bore round, Smoking with new-cooked pillaw, Badhan's dish Carved from rock-crystal, with the feet in gold, And garnets round the rim; but the boy slipped Against the tent-rope, and the precious dish Broke into shards of beauty on the board, Scalding the son of √Çli. One guest cried, ‚ÄúDog! wert thou mine, for this thing thou shouldst howl!‚Äù Another, ‚ÄúWretch! thou meritest to die.‚Äù And yet another, ‚ÄúHassan! give me leave To smite away this swine's head with my sword!‚Äù Even Hassan's self was moved; but the boy fell Face to the earth and cried, ‚ÄúMy lord! 'tis writ, ‚ÄòParadise is for them that check their wrath.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äú'Tis writ so,‚Äù Hassan said; ‚ÄúI am not wroth.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy lord!‚Äù the boy sobbed on, ‚Äúalso 'tis writ, ‚ÄòPardon the trespasser.‚Äô‚Äù Hassan replied, ‚Äú'Tis written‚ÄîI remember‚ÄîI forgive.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow is the blessing of the Most High God On thee, dear master!‚Äù cried the happy slave, ‚ÄúFor He‚Äî'tis writ‚Äî‚Äúloves the beneficent.‚Äù‚Äù ‚ÄúYea! I remember, and I thank thee, slave,‚Äù Quoth Hassan;‚Äî‚Äúbetter is one noble verse Fetched from ‚Äúthe Book,‚Äù than gold and crystal brought From Yaman's hills. Lords! he hath marred the dish, But mended fault with wisdom. See, my slave! I give thee freedom, and this purse to buy The robe and turban of a Muslim freed.‚Äù Al-Gh√¢fir! pardon us, as we Forgive a brother's injury. 36Ash-Sh√¢kir ‚ÄúGrateful‚Äù‚ÄîAsh-Sh√¢kir‚Äîis He; praise Him so Who thanketh men for that He did bestow. So much hast thou of thy hoard As thou gavest to thy Lord; Only this will bring thee in Usance rich and free from sin: Send thy silver on before, Lending to His sick and poor. Every dirhem dropped in alms Touches Allah's open palms, Ere it fall into the hands Of thy brother. Allah stands Begging of thee, when thy brother Asketh help. Ah! if another Proffered thee, for meat and drink, Food upon Al-K√¢uthar's brink, Cf. Kor√¢n, cviii. ‚Äî‚ÄúAl-K√¢uthar.‚Äù This word signifies abundance especially of good, and thence the gift of wisdom and prophecy. Or it may mean abundance of wealth, followers, and the like. It is here used of a river in Paradise, whence the water is derived into Muhammad's pond, of which the blessed are to drink before their admission. According to a tradition of the Prophet, this river, wherein his Lord promised him abundant good, is sweeter than honey, whiter than milk, cooler than snow, and smoother than cream; its banks are of chrysolites, and those who drink of it shall never thirst. Shining K√¢uthar which doth flow Sweet as honey, cool as snow, White as milk, and smooth as cream, Underneath its banks, which gleam‚Äî Green and golden chrysolite, In the Gardens of delight, Whence who drinks never again Tasteth sorrow, age, or pain‚Äî Who would not make merchandise, Buying bliss in Paradise, Laying up his treasure where Stores are safe and profits clear? But ye lend at lower cost, Whilst Ash-Sh√¢kir offers most, Good returning seven times seven, Paying gifts of earth with Heaven. Allah, Who dost reward so well, What maketh man in sin to dwell? 37Al-`Alee Al-'Hal√Æ! O believers, magnify By this great name, Allah, our Lord ‚ÄúMost High.‚Äù He willed, and Heaven's blue arch vaulted the air; ‚ÄúBe!‚Äù said He‚ÄîEarth! Cf. Kor√¢n, xvi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Bee.‚Äù and the round earth was made; See! at the hour of late and early prayer The very shadows worship Him, low laid. Most High! the lengthening shadows teach Morning and evening prayer to each. 38Al-Kab√Æt Praise Him, Al-Kab√Ær, seated on ‚Äúthe Throne,‚Äù The ‚ÄúVery Great,‚Äù the High-exalted One. Seven Heavens Allah made: First ‚ÄúParadise,‚Äù the Jennat-al-Firdaus; The next, Al Huld, ‚ÄúGate of Eternity;‚Äù The third, Dar-as-Sal√¢m, the ‚ÄúPeaceful House;‚Äù The fourth, Dar-al-Kur√¢r, ‚ÄúFelicity;‚Äù The fifth was Aidenn, ‚ÄúHome of Golden Light;‚Äù The sixth, Al Na'h√Æm, ‚ÄúGarden of Delight;‚Äù The seventh, Al-Hilliy√ªn, ‚ÄúFootstool of the Throne;‚Äù And, each and every one, Sphere above sphere, and treasure over treasure, The great decree of God made for reward and pleasure. Saith the Perspicuous Book: Cf. Kor√¢n, lxvii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Kingdom.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook up to Heaven! look! Dost thou see flaw or fault In that vast vault, Spangled with silvery lamps of night, Or gilded with glad light Of sunrise, or of sunset, or warm noon? Rounded He well the moon? Kindled He wisely the red Lord of Day? Look twice! look thrice, and say!‚Äù Thy weak gaze fails; Eyesight is drowned in yon abyss of blue; Ye see the glory, but ye see not through: God's greatness veils Its greatness by its greatness‚Äîall that wonder Lieth the lowest of those Heavens under, Beyond which Angels view Allah, and Allah's mighty works, asunder; The thronged clouds whisper of it when they thunder. Allah Kab√Ær! in silence we Meditate on Thy majesty. 39Al-H√¢fiz Al-H√¢fiz! O ‚ÄúPreserver!‚Äù succour us Who, humbly trustful, cry unto Thee thus. By the Sky and the Night star! By Al-T√¢rek the white star! ‚ÄúAl-T√¢rek‚Äù is the ‚Äústar that appears‚Äù by night, i.e., the morning star. Shining clear‚Äî When darkness covers man and beast‚Äî To proclaim dawn near, And the gold sun hastening from the east, We have set a guard upon you, every one; Be ye not afraid! Of seed from loins, and milk from bosom-bone, Ye were made: We are able to remake you, when ye die, For cold death Cometh forth from Us, as warm life cometh And gift of breath. Do the darkness and the terror plot against you? We also plan; They that love you are stronger than your haters. Trust God, O man! Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxvi. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Night Star.‚Äù ‚ÄúYa H√¢fiz!‚Äù on your doors ye grave; In your hearts, too, these scriptures have! 40Al-Muk√Æt Praise Al-Mukit, the great ‚ÄúMaintainer!‚Äù He Made us, and makes our sustenance to be. The chapter of ‚Äúthe Inevitable:‚Äù Kor√¢n, lvi. We gave The life ye live; why doubt ye We can save What once hath been from wasting‚Äîif We will‚Äî When, like dry corn, man lieth in his grave? Did ye cause seed to grow, or was it We,‚Äî Wherefrom spring all the many lives that be? Who stirred the pulse which couples man and maid And in the fruit hid that which forms the tree? Ye go afield to scatter grain, and then Sleep, while We change it into bread for men; Have ye bethought why seed should shoot, not sand, Granite, or gravel? Why the gentle rain Falleth so clean and sweet from out Our sky, Which might be salt and black and bitter? Why The soft clouds gather it from off the seas To spread it o'er the pastures by and by? The flame ye strike rubbing Af√¢r and Markh, The woods used by the ancient Arabs to kindle fire. Have ye considered that strange yellow spark? Did ye conceive such marvel, or did We Grant it, to warm and cheer men in the dark? Not now, but when the soul comes to the neck, ‚ÄúWhen the soul comes to the neck.‚Äù A Kor√¢nic phrase for the last gasp of death. The meaning of those mercies each shall reck. Then are We nearest, though ye see it not; Can ye that summon√®d spirit order back? Nay, Al-Muk√Æt! in life and death Thine are we: Truth Thy Scripture saith. 41Al-Has√Æb Laud Him as ‚ÄúReckoner,‚Äù casting up th' account, And making little merits largely mount. Give more than thou takest: If one shall salute thee, Saying, ‚ÄúPeace be upon thee,‚Äù The salute which thou makest, Speak it friendlier still, As beseemeth goodwill; Saying, ‚ÄúPeace, too, and love From Allah above Be with thee:‚Äù‚Äîfor heard Is each brotherly word; And it shall not be lost That thou gavest him most. Cf. Kor√¢n, iv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Women.‚Äù Ya Has√Æb! praise to Thee; for all Our good deeds needs must be so small. 42Al-Jam√Æl Al-Jamil!‚Äúthe Benign;‚Äùah, name most dear, Which bids us love and worship without fear. Too much ye tremble, too much fear to feel That yearning love which Allah's laws reveal; Too oft forget‚Äîyour troubled journey through‚Äî He who is Power, is Grace and Beauty too, And Clemency, and Pity, and Pure Rest, The Highest and the Uttermost and Best; Sweeter than honey, and more dear to see Than any loveliness on land or sea By bard or lover praised, or famed in story; For these were shadows of His perfect glory; Which is not told, because, who sees God near Loseth the speech to speak, in loving fear, So joyous is he, so astonish√´d. Hath there come to ye what the Dervish said, At Kaisareya, in the marble shrine, Who woke from vision of the love divine? ‚ÄúI have seen Allah!‚Äù quoth he‚Äîall a-glow With splendour of the dream which filled him so‚Äî ‚ÄúYea! I have paced the Garden of Delight, And heard and known!‚Äù ‚ÄúImpart to us thy light,‚Äù His fellows cried. He paused, and smiled, and spake: ‚ÄúFain would I say it, brothers, for your sake, For I have wandered in a sphere so bright, Have heard such things, and witnessed such a sight, That now I know whither all nature turns, And what the love celestial is which burns, At the great heart of all the world, ensuring That griefs shall pass and joy be all enduring. Yet ask me not! I am as one who came Where, among roses, one bush, all aflame By fragrant crimson blossoms, charged the air With loveliness and perfume past compare. Then had I thought to load my skirt with roses, That ye might judge what wealth that land discloses; And filled my robe, plucking the peerless blooms; But ah! the scent so rich, so heavenly, comes; So were my senses melted into bliss With the intoxicating breath of this; I let the border of my mantle fall‚Äî The roses slipped! I bring ye none at all.‚Äù Brothers! with other eyes must we Behold the Roses on that Tree. ‚ÄúThe roses on that tree.‚Äù In the mystic language of the East, the rose is the symbol of that Divine beauty which is the object of the soul's love. 43Al-Kar√Æm Allah-al-Kar√Æm! Bountiful Lord! we bless By this good name Thy loving kindnesses. O man! what hath beguiled, That thou shouldst stray From the plain easy way Of Allah's service, being Allah's child? When thou wert not, And when thou wast a clot, He did foresee thee, and did fashion thee From heel to nape, Giving thee this fair shape, Composing thee in wondrous symmetry‚Äî More than thy mother‚Äîin the form thou wearest; Nearer to thee than what on earth is nearest. Kinder than kin is He‚Äî Wilt thou forgetful be? Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Cleaving Asunder.‚Äù Ya Kar√Æm! since Thou lovest thus, Quicken, ah, quicken love in us. 44Al-Rak√Æb Allah-al-Rak√Æb! praise ye ‚Äúthe Watchful One,‚Äù Who noteth what men do and leave undone. The book of the wicked is in Sijj√Æn, A close-writ book: A book to be unfolded on the Awful Day, The day whereto men would not look. What Sijj√Æn is Who shall make thee know? The Black Gaol. Under Jehannum, Under Lath√¢, the ‚Äúred glow,‚Äù Under Hutamah, ‚Äúthe fires which split;‚Äù Beneath Sa'h√Ær, the ‚ÄúYellow Hell,‚Äù And scorching Sakar, lieth it, And Jah√Æm, where devils dwell: Lower from light and bliss Than H√¢wiyeh, ‚Äúthe abyss:‚Äù Sijj√Æn is this. But the books of the righteous are in Hilliy√ªn, ‚ÄúHilliy√ªn.‚Äù This means literally ‚Äúexalted places.‚Äù And what shall make thee see The glory of that region, nigh to God, Where those records be? Joy shall make their portion: they shall lie With the light of delight upon their faces, On soft seats reclining In peaceful places; Drinking wine, pure wine, sealed wine, Whose seal is musk and rose; Allayed by the crystal waves that shine In Tasm√Æn, which flows ‚ÄúTasm√Æn.‚Äù A stream in Paradise, so called because it waters the highest regions there. From the golden throne of God:‚Äîat its brink Angels drink. Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxiii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Short Weight.‚Äù O ‚ÄúWatcher!‚Äù grant our names may be In that Book lying near to Thee. 45Al-Muj√Æb Allah-al-Muj√Æb, Who biddest men to pray, And hearest prayer; thus praise we Thee alway. Our Lord the Prophet (peace to him!) doth write‚Äî Sura the seventeenth, intituled ‚ÄúNight:‚Äù‚Äî ‚ÄúPray at the noon, pray at the sinking sun, In night-time pray; but most when night is done, For daybreak's prayer is surely borne on high By Angels changing guard within the sky.‚Äù And in another verse, ‚ÄúDawn's prayer is more Than the wide world with all its treasured store.‚Äù Therefore the Faithful, when the growing light Gives to discern a black hair from a white, Haste to the mosque, and, bending Mecca-way, Recite Al-F√¢tihah while 'tis scarce yet day: This is the 1st chapter of the Kor√¢n, which is also a prayer, and held in great veneration by the Muhammedans, who give it many honourable titles; as the chapter of prayer, of praise, of thanksgiving They regard it as the quintessence of the whole Kor√¢n, and often repeat it in their devotions both public and private, as Christians do the Lord's Prayer. Praise be to Allah, Lord of all that live. Merciful King and Judge, to Thee we give Worship and honour! Succour us and guide Where those have walked who rest Thy Throne beside; The way of peace, the way of truthful speech, The way of righteousness. So we beseech.‚Äù He who saith this, before the east is red, A hundred prayers of Azan hath he said. Hear now this story of it‚Äîtold, I ween, For your soul's comfort by Jelalu-'d-deen In the great pages of the Mesnev√Æ; For therein, plain and certain, shall ye see How precious is the prayer at break of day In Allah's ears, and in His sight alway How sweet are reverence and gentleness Done to His creatures:‚Äî‚Äú√Çli‚Äù (whom I bless!), The son of Abu Talib‚Äîhe, surnamed ‚ÄúLion of God,‚Äù in many battles famed, The cousin of our Lord the Prophet (grace Be his!), uprose betimes one morn, to pace, As he was wont, unto the mosque, wherein Our Lord (bliss live with him!) watched to begin Al-F√¢tihah. Darkling was the sky, and strait The lane between the city and mosque-gate, By rough stones broken and deep pools of rain; And therethrough toilfully, with steps of pain, Leaning upon his staff an old Jew went To synagogue, on pious errand bent; For those be ‚ÄúPeople of the Book,‚Äù and some Are chosen of Allah's will who have not come Unto full light of knowledge; therefore, he, √Çli, the Caliph of proud days to be‚Äî Knowing this good old man, and why he stirred Thus early, ere the morning mills were heard‚Äî ‚ÄúThe morning mills.‚Äù At daybreak in Eastern countries almost the first sound of awaking domestic life is the noise of the stones used to grind meal. Out of his nobleness and grace of soul Would not thrust past, though the Jew blocked the whole Breadth of the lane, slow hobbling. So they went, That ancient first; and, in soft discontent, After him √Çli, noting how the sun Flared near, and fearing prayer might be begun; Yet no command upraising, no harsh cry To stand aside, because the dignity Of silver hairs is much, and morning praise Was precious to the Jew, too. Thus their ways Wended the pair; great √Çli, sad and slow, Following the greybeard, while the east, a-glow, Blazed with bright spears of gold athwart the blue, And the Muezzin's call came, ‚ÄúIllahu! ‚ÄúThe time for prayer,‚Äù says Professor Palmer, ‚Äúis called from the minarets of the mosques by Muezzins or criers, in the following words:‚Äî‚ÄòGod is great‚Äô (4 times); ‚ÄòI bear witness that there is no God but God‚Äô (twice); ‚ÄòI bear witness that Muhammad is the apostle of God‚Äô (twice); ‚ÄòCome hither to prayers‚Äô (twice); ‚ÄòCome hither to salvation‚Äô (twice); ‚ÄòGod is just!‚Äô ‚ÄòThere is no other God than God!‚Äô In the early morning the Muezzin adds, ‚ÄòPrayer is better than sleep!‚Äô‚Äù Allah-il-Allah!‚Äù In the mosque, our Lord (On whom be peace) stood by the mimbar-board, In act to bow and F√¢tihah forth to say. But, while his lips moved, some strong hand did lay Over his mouth a palm invisible, So that no voice on the assembly fell. Ya! Rabbi 'lalam√Æna‚Äîthrice he tried To read, and thrice the sound of reading died, Stayed by this unseen touch. Thereat amazed, Our Lord Muhammad turned, arose, and gazed, And saw‚Äîalone of all within the shrine‚Äî A splendid Presence, with large eyes divine Beaming, and golden pinions folded down, Their speed still tokened by the fluttered gown: Gabriel he knew, the Spirit who doth stand Chief of the Sons of Heav'n, at God's right hand; ‚ÄúGabriel! why stay'st thou me?‚Äù the Prophet said, ‚ÄúSince at this hour the F√¢tihah should be read.‚Äù But the bright Presence, smiling, pointed where √Çli towards the outer gate drew near, Upon the threshold shaking off his shoes, And giving ‚Äúalms of entry,‚Äù as men use. ‚ÄúYea!‚Äù spake th' Archangel, ‚Äúsacred is the sound Of morning praise, and worth the world's great round, Though earth were pearl and silver; therefore I Stayed thee, Muhammad, in the act to cry, Lest √Çli, tarrying in the lane, should miss, For his good deed, its blessing and its bliss.‚Äù Thereat the Archangel vanished, and our Lord Read F√¢tihah forth beneath the mimbar-board. Us, too, Muj√Æb! in hearing keep; Better is prayer than food or sleep! 46Al-Was`ih ‚ÄúAll-comprehending One,‚Äù Al-Wasi'h! we By this name also praise and honour Thee. Turn, wheresoe'er ye be, to Mecca's stone, For this is holy, and your Lord doth hear; Thitherwards turn!‚Äîso hath all Isl√¢m one Heart to its thought and harbour of its prayer. But Allah's house eastwards and westwards lies, Northwards and southwards. He is everywhere: Whithersoever way ye bend your eyes, Face to face are ye with Al-Wasi'h there. It is not righteousness to kneel aright Fronting the Kiblah; but to rightly hold Of God, and of His judgment, and the bright Bands of His Angels; and what truth is told In the sure Kor√¢n by God's holy Prophet; To succour orphans, strangers, suppliants, kin; Your gold and worldly treasure‚Äîto give of it Ransom for captives, alms which mercy win: To keep your covenants when ye covenant; Your woes and sufferings patiently to bear, Being the will of God:‚Äîthis is to front Straight for the Kiblah: this is faith and fear. Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Cow.‚Äù Abounding Lord! in every place Is built the Mecca of Thy grace. 47Al-H√¢kim al Mutlak Al-H√¢kim! Judge of all the judges! show Mercy to us and make us justice know. Only one Judge is just, for only One Knoweth the hearts of men; and hearts alone Are guilty or are guiltless. That which lied Was not the tongue‚Äîhe is a red dog tied. And that which slew was not the hand ye saw Grasping the knife‚Äîshe is a slave whose law The master gives, seated within the tent; The hand was handle to the instrument; The dark heart murdered. O believers! leave Judgment to Heav'n‚Äîexcept ye do receive Office and order to accomplish this; Then honourable, and terrible, it is. The Prophet said: Cf. the Mishk√¢t-al-M√¢s√¢b√Æh. ‚ÄúThe Mishk√¢t-al-M√¢s√¢b√Æh.‚Äù The book of the conversations of the Prophet.‚ÄúAt the great day of doom Such fear on the most upright judge shall come That he shall moan, ‚ÄòAh! would to God that I Had stood for trial, and not sate to try!‚Äô‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúThe Angels of the Scales will bring Just and unjust who judged before Heav'n's King, Grasping them by the neck; and, if it be, One hath adjudged his fellows wickedly, He shall be hurled to hell so vast a height 'Tis forty years' fierce journey ere he light; But if one righteously hath borne the rod, The Angels kiss those lips which spake for God.‚Äù Lord! make us just, that we may be A little justified with Thee. 48Al-Wadood ‚ÄúThe Loving‚Äù‚ÄîAl-Wadood! ah, title dear, Whereby Thy children praise Thee, free of fear. Sweet seem your wedded days; and dear and tender Your children's talk; brave 'tis to hear the tramp Of pastured horses; and to see the splendour Of gold and silver plunder; and to camp With goats and camels by the bubbling fountain; And to drink fragrance from the desert wind, And to sit silent on the mighty mountain; And all the joys which make life bright and kind. But ye have heard of streams more brightly flowing Than those whereby ye wander; of a life Glorious and glad and pure beyond earth's knowing; Love without loss, and wealth without the strife. Lo! we have told you of the golden Garden Kept for the Faithful, where the soil is still Wheat-flour and musk and camphire, and fruits harden To what delicious savour each man will Upon the Tooba tree; which bends its cluster To him that doth desire, bearing all meat; And of the sparkling fountains which out-lustre Diamonds and emeralds, running clear and sweet, Tasm√Æn and Salsab√Æl, whose lucent waters Are rich, delicious, undistracting wine; And of the Houris, pleasure's perfect daughters, Virgins of Paradise, whose black eyes shine Soul-deep with love and languor, having tresses Night-dark, with scents of the gold-blooming date And scarlet roses; lavishing caresses That satisfy, but never satiate; Whose looks refrain from any save their lover, Whose peerless limbs and bosoms' ivory swell Are like the ostrich egg which feathers cover From stain and dust, so white and rounded well: Dwelling in marvellous pavilions, builded Of hollow pearls, wherethrough a great light shines‚Äî Cooled by soft breezes and by glad suns gilded‚Äî On the green pillows where the Blest reclines. A rich reward it shall be, a full payment For life's brief trials and sad virtue's stress, When friends with friends, clad all in festal raiment, Share in deep Heaven the Angels' happiness; Nay, and full payment, though ye give those pleasures Which make life dear, to fight and die for faith, Rendering to God your wives and flocks and treasures, That He may pay you tenfold after death. For, if the bliss of Paradise, transcending Delights of earth, should win ye to be bold, Yet know, this glory hath its crown and ending In Allah's grace, which is the Joy untold, The Utmost Bliss. Beyond the Happy River The justified shall see God's face in Heaven, Live in His sweet goodwill, Cf. Kor√¢n, ix. chapter ‚ÄúOf Repentance.‚Äù and taste for ever Al-Wadood's Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Zodiacal Signs.‚Äù love, unto His children given. Yea! for high Heaven's felicity Is but the shadow, Lord, of Thee. 49Al-Maj√Æd Al-Maj√Æd! Glorious Lord upon the Throne, Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Celestial Signs.‚Äù With this great name we praise Thee, Sovereign One! By the Heavens, walled with silver signs and towers! By the Promised Day! By the Witness and the Witnessed; and the Way Of righteousness!‚Äîthis glorious Book of ours Lieth treasured up in Heaven, As 'twas given On the mighty ‚ÄúNight of Powers;‚Äù Lailat-al-Kadr, ‚ÄúThe Night of Power,‚Äù was that on which the Kor√¢n was declared to have been revealed. And its easy bond is this, The which to keep is bliss: ‚ÄúNone save Glorious Allah serve; Never from His precepts swerve; Honour teacher, father, mother; Unto him who is thy brother, Unto kindred, friends also, Orphans, suppliants, sad ones, show Gentleness and help; to each Speak with kind and courteous speech. Give in alms that thou may'st spare, And be constant in thy prayer.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer.‚Äù Allah al-Maj√Æd! Thy favour grant, That we may keep this covenant. 50Al-B√¢hith Al-B√¢hith! Opener of the Tombs! we praise Thy power, which unto life the dead can raise. Ibl√Æs spake to Abraham: ‚ÄúWhat is this thy Lord hath told thee? Shall the Resurrection be When the mouldering clods enfold thee? Nay! and if a man might rise, Buried whole, in heedful wise, See yon carcase, tempest-beaten‚Äî Part the wandering fox hath eaten, Part by fishes hath been torn, Part the sea-fowl hence have borne; Never back those fragments can Come to him who was a man.‚Äù Abraham spake unto his Lord: Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer.‚Äù ‚ÄúShow me how is wrought this wonder; Can Thy resurrection be When a man's dust lies asunder?‚Äù ‚ÄúArt thou therefore not believing,‚Äù Allah said, ‚Äúbecause deceiving Ibl√Æs fills with lies thy heart?‚Äù ‚ÄúNay,‚Äù he answered, ‚Äúbut impart Knowledge, Mightiest One and Best! That my heart may be at rest.‚Äù God said: ‚ÄúTake, thou doubting one! Four birds from among My creatures; Sever each bird's head, and so Mingle feathers, forms, and features, That the fragments shall not be Knowable to such as ye. Into four divide the mass, Then upon the mountains pass, On four peaks a portion lay, And, returning homeward, say, ‚ÄúBy the name and power of God‚Äî Who hath made men of the clod, And hath said the dead shall rise‚Äî Birds! fly hither in such wise As ye lived.‚Äù And they shall come, Perfect, whole, and living, home.‚Äù Thereupon Al-Khal√Æl took A raven, eagle, dove, and cock; From their bodies shore the heads, Cut the four fowl into shreds, Mingled all their mass together, Blood and bone, and flesh and feather; Then, dividing this four-wise, Laid it wgere four peaks did rise Two to south and two to north. Then the dove's head held he forth, Crying, ‚ÄúCome!‚Äù Lo! at the word Cooed at his feet the slaughtered bird. ‚ÄúCome, raven!‚Äù spake he: as he spoke, On glossy wing, with eager croak, Flew round the raven. Then he said, ‚ÄúReturn! thou cock:‚Äù the cock obeyed. Lastly the eagle summoned he, Which circling came, on pinions free, Restored and soaring to the sky, With perfect plumes and undimmed eye. So in the Holy Book 'tis writ How Abraham's heart at rest was set. Why should we fear to yield our breath, To Thee That art the Lord of Death? 51Ash-Shah√Æd Ash-Shah√Æd! God is ‚ÄúWitness!‚Äù and He took Witness of us, ye People of the Book! The spirits of the Prophets came at morn To Sinai, summoned by their Lord's command, Singers and seers;‚Äîthose born and those unborn, The chosen souls of men, a solemn band. The noble army ranged, in viewless might, Around that mountain peak which picrces heaven; Greater and lesser teachers, sons of light; Their number was ten thousand score and seven. Then Allah took a covenant with His own, Saying, ‚ÄúMy wisdom and My word receive; Speak of Me unto men, known or unknown, Heard or unheard; bid such as will, believe.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd there shall come apostles, guiding ye, Jesus, Muhammad: follow them and aid! Are you resolved, and will you war for Me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are resolved, O Lord of all!‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúBear witness then!‚Äù spake Allah, ‚Äúsouls most dear, I am your Lord and ye heralds of Mine.‚Äù Thenceforward through all lands His Prophets bear The message of the mystery divine. Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù Allah-ash-Shah√Æd! make us to hear The errand that Thy children bear. 52Al-Hakk O Thou, the Truth! when so Thy name we call, All's said that need be said, sith Thou art all. Truth and all truth He is! serve Him alone Who hath none other by nor near His Throne; Unto all sins is Allah's pardon given Except what giveth Him partners in Heaven, Cf. Kor√¢n, iv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Women.‚Äù Being Apart, Exalted, Truth and Light, Only and wholly‚Äîhold thou this aright! Ya Hakk! true God! never with Thee Can other or can equal be. 53Al-Wak√Æl Alai kul shay Wak√Æl! Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer.‚Äù Guardian of all! By this name trustfully on Thee we call. Verily God is guard! What other hath created you, and made Men gone before, and earth's foundations laid So broad and hard, To be your dwelling-place; And Heaven's star-jewelled face Arched for your roof-top; and the tender rain Sent down at the due season, whereby grain Groweth, and clustered gold Of dates, and grapes that hold The purple and the amber honey-juice? These for your use Your Lord and ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù gave. Make Him no peers, nor other guardian have. Allah-al-Wak√Æl! Thy wards are we; Have us in Thy fidelity. 54Al-Kawi Thou mighty One! Whose mercy hath upraised Mankind to praise Thee, be Thou hereby praised! Consider them that serve The false gods, how they lay in golden dishes Honey and fruits and fishes Before their idols; and the green fly comes, Shoots through the guarded gates, and hums Scorn of their offering, stealing what she will; And none of these great gods the thief can kill, So swift she is and small: And none of all Can make one little fly, for all their state; So feeble are they, and so falsely great. Cf. Kor√¢n, xxii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Believers.‚Äù Ye people of the stocks and stones! herein A parable is set against your sin. But Allah high doth rule Whose hand made all things, being ‚ÄúPowerful.‚Äù Al-Kaw√Æ! King of power and might! Be Thy hand o'er us day and night! 55Al-Mateen Allah-al-Mateen! ‚ÄúFirm‚Äù is our Lord and fast; Praise Him Who doth uphold Thee to the last. By the Angels ranged in ranks, And the Rain-cloud Drivers, And the Reciters of the word, ‚ÄúThy God is one,‚Äù Firm is our Lord! Of the heavens the tent-pole, Al-Watad; and of earth Habl-al-Mateen, the sure Cord: Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Family of Imran.‚Äù By this thy soul Holdeth, from birth: Fast is the cord, and sure; They only shall endure Who dwell beneath the mighty tent upholden By Al-Watad, Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxviii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Information.‚Äù the Golden. Stay of Thy servants, Al-Mateen! In Thee is strong deliverance seen. 56Al-Wal√Æ Al-Wal√Æ! Nearest of all friends, and Best, So praise your Lord, Whose help is mightiest. Close is He always to His faithful ones, But closer dwelt they in the times of old. Hath it come to ye what Al-Baidh√¢wi Presenteth of the days of Abraham, Whom Allah called His ‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù and like a friend Softly entreated, Cf. Kor√¢n, iv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Women.‚Äù stooping out of Heaven To help and comfort him so dear to God? Ofttimes the Angels of his Lord would light Familiarly, with folded wings, before The curtain of his tent, conversing there; Ofttimes, on thorny flats of wilderness, Or in the parched pass, or the echoing cave, The very voice of God would thrill his ears; And he might answer, as a man with man, Hearing and speaking things unspeakable. Wherefore, no marvel that he gave his son At Allah's bidding, and had back his son‚Äî Patient and safe‚Äîwhen the wild goat came down And hung amid the nebbuk by his horns, On Thab√Ær, nigh to Mecca, in the vale Of Mina; Cf. Koran, xxxvii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Ranged.‚Äù and the knife of Abraham Reddened with unwept blood. There had fall'n drought Upon the land, and all the mouths he fed Hungered for meal; therefore Al-Khal√Æl sent Messengers unto Egypt‚Äîto a lord Wealthy and favourable, having store Of grain and cattle by the banks of Nile. ‚ÄúGive unto Abraham,‚Äù the message said, ‚ÄúA little part for gold, yet more for love‚Äî (As he had given, if the strait were thine) Meal of the millet, lentil, wheat, and bean, That he and his may live; for drought hath come Upon our fields and pastures, and we pine.‚Äù Spake the Egyptian lord, ‚ÄúLo! now ye ask O'ermuch of me for friendliness, and more Than gold can buy, since dearth hath also come Over our fields, and nothing is to spare. Yet had it been to succour Abraham, And them that dwell beneath his tent, the half Of all we hold had filled your empty sacks. But he will feed people we wot not of, Poor folk, and hungry wanderers of the waste: The which are nought to us, who have of such, If there were surplusage. Therefore return; Find food elsewhere!‚Äù Then said the messengers One to another, ‚ÄúIf we shall return With empty sacks, our master's name, so great For worship in the world, will suffer shame, And men will say he asked and was denied.‚Äù Therefore they filled their sacks with white seasand Gathered by Gaza's wave, and sorrowfully Journeyed to Kedar, where lay Abraham, To whom full privately they told this thing, Saying, ‚ÄúWe filled the sacks with snow-white sand, Lest thy great name be lessened 'mongst the folk, Seeing us empty-handed; for the man Denied thee corn; since thou wouldst give, quoth he, To poor folk and to wanderers of the waste, And there are hungry mouths enough by Nile.‚Äù Then was the heart of Abraham sore, because The people of his tribe drew round to share The good food brought, and all the desert trooped With large-eyed mothers and their pining babes, Certain of succour if the sheikh could help. So did the spirit of Al-Khal√Æl sink That into swoon he fell, and lay as one Who hath not life. But Sarai, his wife‚Äî That knew not‚Äîbade her maidens bring a sack, Open its mouth, and knead some meal for cakes. And when the sack was opened, there showed flour, Fine, three times bolted, whiter than sea-sand; Which in the trough they kneaded, rolling cakes, And baking them over the crackling thorns; So that the savour spread throughout the camp Of new bread smoking, and the people drew Closer and thicker, as ye see the herds Throng‚Äîhorn, and wool, and hoof‚Äîat watering-time, When after fiery leagues, the wells are reached. But Abraham, awaking, smelled the bread: ‚ÄúWhence,‚Äù spake he unto Sarai, ‚Äúhast thou meal, Wife of my bosom? for the smell of bread Riseth, and lo! I see the cakes are baked.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy God! Who is the only One,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúWhence should it come save from thy friend who sent, The lord of Egypt?‚Äù ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù quoth Abraham, And fell upon his face, low-worshipping, ‚ÄúBut this hath come from the dear mighty hands Of Allah‚Äîof the Lord of Egypt's lords‚Äî My ‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù and King, and Helper: now my folk Shall live and die not. Glory be to God!‚Äù He that hath Allah for a friend, To want and woe hath put the end. 57Al-Ham√Æd Rich to reward your Lord is; oh, do ye Praise Al-Ham√Æd, the ‚ÄúEver-praiseworthy!‚Äù Praise Him by alms; and when ye help believers, Mar not your gifts with grudging word or will; Since ye at Allah's hands are free receivers, Freely bestow. A garden on a hill Is as a likeness of that fair compassion Shown for the sake of God: the heavy rain Descendeth, and the dew; and every fashion Of good seed springs tenfold in fruit and grain. The likeness of the evil heart, bestowing That men may praise, is as the thin-clad pcak, Wherefrom the rain washes all soil for growing, Leaving the hard rock naked, fruitless, bleak. Say, will ye plant on rock or plenteous garden? Grow nought, or grow green vines that shade afford?‚Äî Forgive your brethren as ye ask for pardon; Give as ye have received, and praise your Lord! Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer.‚Äù Allah-al-Ham√Æd! what tongue can tell Thy goodness, ever-laudable? 58Al-M√ªhsi Al-M√ªhsi! The ‚ÄúAccountant!‚Äù laud Him so Who reckoneth up the deeds men do below. ‚ÄúIN GOD'S NAME, MERCIFUL, COMPASSIONATE!‚Äù When Earth shall quake with quaking, Cf. Kor√¢n, xcix. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Earthquake.‚Äù And cast her burden forth Of corpses; and live men Shall ask‚Äîwith terror shaking‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat aileth Earth?‚Äù that day She shall reply, and say That which her Lord commands: And men shall come in bands, This side and that side, ranged to show Their works, and the account to know. And he that wrought of good a red ant's weight Shall see it writ: And who did evil, aye! as the skin of a date, Shall witness it. Al-M√ªhsi! dread Accountant! look In mercy on our judgment-book. 59Al-Mubd√Æ Al-Mubd√Æ! praise Him by this holy name, Who gave to all the spark which lights life's flame. Whence came ye; and the people of the groves; The streams, the seas, the wilderness, the air; Beasts, fishes, fowl; each with their lives and loves, Each glad to be, each in its kind so fair? ‚ÄúBegotten of their like?‚Äù Yea! but ‚Äútheir like,‚Äù Who did devise that, and the hidden charm Whereby‚Äîas flame from torch to torch doth strike‚Äî The light of life shines on, bright, joyous, warm? Al-Mubd√Æ hath devised it! His decree In the beginning shaped and ordered each, Saying to all these things foreseen, ‚ÄúSo be!‚Äù And so they were, obeying Allah's speech. Al-Mubd√Æ! ‚ÄúGreat Beginner!‚Äù take Our praises, for life's pleasant sake! 60Al-Mu'h√Æd He made life‚Äîand He takes it‚Äîbut instead Gives more; praise the Restorer, Al-Mu'h√Æd! He who died at Azan sends This to comfort faithful friends: Faithful friends! it lies, I know, Pale and white and cold as snow; And ye say, ‚ÄúAbdullah's dead!‚Äù Weeping at my feet and head; I can see your falling tears, I can hear your cries and prayers; Yet I smile, and whisper this‚Äî ‚ÄúI am not that thing you kiss; Cease your tears, and let it lie; It was mine, it is not I.‚Äù Sweet friends! what the women lave, For its last bed in the grave, Is a tent which I am quitting, Is a garment no more fitting, Is a cage from which, at last, Like a hawk my soul hath passed. Love the inmate, not the room; The wearer, not the garb; the plume Of the falcon, not the bars Which kept him from the splendid stars. Loving friends! be wise, and dry Straightway every weeping eye; What ye lift upon the bier Is not worth a wistful tear. 'Tis an empty sea-shell, one Out of which the pearl is gone; The shell is broken, it lies there; The pearl, the all, the soul, is here. 'Tis an earthen jar whose lid Allah sealed, the while it hid That treasure of His treasury, A mind which loved Him; let it lie! Let the shard be earth's once more, Since the gold shines in His store! Allah Mu'h√Æd, Allah most good! Now Thy grace is understood; Now my heart no longer wonders What Al-Barsakh Cf. Kor√¢n, xxiii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Believers.‚Äù is, which sunders ‚ÄúAl-Barsakh.‚Äù The Kor√¢n says, ‚ÄúBehind them shall be a bar, until the day of resurrection.‚Äù Upon this Sale writes:‚ÄúThe original word barzakh, here translated ‚Äòbar,‚Äô primarily signifies any partition, or interstice, which divides one thing from another; but is used by the Arabs not always in the same, and sometimes in an obscure sense. They seem generally to express by it what the Greeks did by the word Hades; one while using it for the place of the dead, another while for the time of their continuance in that state, and another while for the state itself. It is defined by their critics to be the interval or space between this world and the next, or between death and the resurrection; every person who dies being said to enter into Al-Barzakh. The commentators on this passage expound it as a barrier, or invincible obstacle, cutting off all possibility of return into the world, after death.‚Äù Life from death, and death from Heaven; Nor the ‚ÄúParadises Seven‚Äù Which the happy dead inherit; Nor those ‚Äúbirds‚Äù which bear each spirit ‚ÄúBirds.‚Äù If the departed person was a believer, the Muslims say two Angels meet his soul, and convey it to Heaven, that its place there may be assigned, according to its merit and degree. They distinguish the souls of the Faithful into three classes: the first of prophets, whose souls are admitted into Paradise immediately; the second of martyrs, whose spirits, according to a tradition of Muhammad, rest in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the rivers of Paradise; and the third of other believers, concerning the state of whose souls before the resurrection there are various opinions. Some say they stay near the sepulchres, with liberty, however, of going wherever they please; which they confirm from Muhammad's manner of saluting the dead, alluded to elsewhere. Towards the Throne, ‚Äúgreen birds and white,‚Äù Radiant, glorious, swift their flight! Now the long, long darkness ends, Yet ye wail, my foolish friends, While the man whom ye call ‚Äúdead‚Äù In unbroken bliss instead Lives, and loves you; lost, 'tis true By any light which shines for you; But in light ye cannot see Of unfulfilled felicity, And enlarging Paradise, Lives the life that never dies. Farewell, friends! Yet not farewell; Where I am, ye too shall dwell. I am gone before your face A heart-beat's time, a grey ant's pace. When ye come where I have stepped, Ye will marvel why ye wept; Ye will know, by true love taught, That here is all, and there is naught. Weep awhile, if ye are fain, Sunshine still must follow rain! Only not at death, for death‚Äî Now I see‚Äîis that first breath Which our souls draw when we enter Life, that is of all life centre. Know ye Allah's law is love, Viewed from Allah's Throne above: Be ye firm of trust, and come Faithful onward to your home! ‚ÄúLa Allah illa Allah! Yea, Mu'h√Æd! Restorer! Sovereign!‚Äù say! He who died at Azan gave This to those that made his grave. 61Al-Mo'hy√Æ Al-Mo'hy√Æ! the ‚ÄúQuickener!‚Äù hereby Praise Him Whom Angels praise eternally. ‚ÄúAnd of His signs is this,‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xli. chapter ‚ÄúOf Signs Explained.‚Äù saith the Great Book; ‚ÄúUnder the angry sun the slain earth‚Äîlook!‚Äî Dries up to dust; dies every growing thing; Then blow we breaths of southern wind which bring Rain-dropping clouds, and see! the dead earth lives, And stirs, and swells; and every herb revives. So shall the dead be quickened by His breath, This is Al-Mo ‚Äúhy√Æ‚Äùs sign,‚Äù the Great Book saith. O thou believer! shall it be He saves the green thing, and not thee? 62Al-Mum√Æt He quickeneth, but ‚ÄúHe killeth:‚Äù blessed they Who may abide in trust that final day! Yea! some have found right good to hear the summons of their Lord, And gone as glad as warriors proud, who take up spear and sword At sounding of the song of fight; as light of heart as those For whom the bride unveileth her mouth of pearl and rose. Jelalu-'d-'Din, Er-Rumi, the saint of Balkh, the son Of him surnamed ‚ÄúFlower of the Faith,‚Äù this was a chosen one, To whom Death softly showed himself, Heaven's gentle call to give; For what word is it bids us die, save that which made us live? Sick lay he there in Konya; 'twas dawn; the golden stream Of light, new springing in the east, on his thin lips did gleam‚Äî Those lips which spake the praise of God all through his holy years, And murmured now, with faith and hope unchanged, the morning prayers. Then one who watched beside his bed, heard at the inner gate A voice cry, ‚ÄúAftah! ‚Äòopen!‚Äô from far I come, and wait To speak my message to Jel√¢l‚Äîa message that will bring Peace and reward to him who lies the F√¢tihah murmuring.‚Äù Thereat the watcher drew the bar which closed the chamber-door, Wondering and 'feared, for ne'er was heard upon this earth before Accents so sweet and comforting, nor ever eyes of men Saw presence so majestical as his who entered then. Entered with gliding footsteps a bright celestial youth, Splendid and strange in beauty, past words to speak its truth; Midnight is not so dark and deep as was his solemn gaze, By love and pity lighted, as the night with silvery rays. ‚ÄúWhat is thy name?‚Äù the watcher asked, ‚Äúthat I may tell my lord, Thou fair and dreadful messenger! whose glance is as a sword; Whose face is like the Heaven unveiled; whose tender searching voice Maketh the heart cease beating, but bids the soul rejoice.‚Äù ‚ÄúAzrael ana,‚Äù spake the shape, ‚ÄúI am the Spirit of Death; And I am sent from Allah's throne to stay thy master's breath.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome in! come in! thou Bird of God,‚Äù cried joyously Jel√¢l, ‚ÄúFold down thy heavenly plumes and speak!‚ÄîIsl√¢m! what shall be, shall.‚Äù ‚ÄúThou blessed one!‚Äù the Angel said, ‚ÄúI bring thy time of peace; When I have touched thee on the eyes, life's latest ache will cease; God bade me come as I am seen amid the heavenly host, No enemy of awful mould, but he who loveth most.‚Äù ‚ÄúDear Angel! do what thou art bid,‚Äù quoth Jel√¢l, smilingly, ‚ÄúGod willing, thou shalt find to-day a patient one in me; Sweet is the cup of bitterness which cometh in such wise!‚Äù With that he bowed his saintly brow,‚Äîand Azrael kissed his eyes. Al-Mum√Æt! ‚ÄúSlayer!‚Äù send him thus, In love, not anger, unto us. 63Al-Haiy Praise Him, Al-Haiy! the ‚ÄúEver-living‚Äù King, Who to eternal life His own doth bring. Saith the Book: ‚ÄúCount not as dead Cf. Kor√¢n, iii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù Such as for the Faith have bled; Stark and red their bodies lie, But their souls are in the sky, Resident with God, who grants All for which the spirit pants. Joyful are they, resting there Free from sorrow, pain, or fear; Watching us who, left in life, Are not quit, as yet, of strife; But shall soon attain, to share Allah's mercies, and declare‚Äî Side by side with those‚Äîthat He Showeth grace eternally, And withholdeth not the pay At the ending of the day. Ya-Haiy! Thou ever-living Lord, Be ours such work and such reward. 64Al-Ka√Æy√ªm Magnify Him, Al-Ka√Æyum; and so call The ‚ÄúSelf-subsisting‚Äù God Who judgeth all. When the trumpet shall sound, On that day, Cf. Kor√¢n, xx. chapter ‚ÄúOf T. H.‚Äù The wicked, slow-gathering, Shall say, ‚ÄúIs it long we have lain in our graves? For it seems as an hour!‚Äù Then will Israfil call them to judgment; And none shall have power To turn aside, this way or that; And their voices will sink To silence, except for the sounding Of a noise, like the noise on the brink Of the sea, when its stones Are dragged with a clatter and hiss Down the shore, in the wild breakers' roar: The sound of their woe shall be this! Then they who denied That He liveth Eternal, ‚ÄúSelf-made,‚Äù Shall call to the mountains to crush them; Amazed and affrayed. Thou Self-subsistent, Living Lord! Thy grace against that day afford. 65Al-W√¢jid Al-W√¢jid! praise hereby that Watchful One Whose eyes see all things underneath the sun. By the Ten holy eves and the Dawns of gold! Cf. Kor√¢n, lxxxix. chapter ‚ÄúOf Daybreak.‚Äù The ‚Äúten holy eves‚Äù are the first ten nights of the sacred month of Dhu'l Hejjeh. By the One and the Manifold! By the deepening of the Darkness of the night! (And these be oaths of might:) Hast thou considered what with Ad God wrought, And whereunto He brought Proud Iram of the pillared throne, ‚ÄúIram‚Äù was the name of the palace and pleasure-garden built by Shedd√¢d, son of Ad, in the desert of Aden. The story is related on another page. Whose like no other land did own; And Tham√ªd's race, which hewed houses of rocks; The Thamudites of the Hadramaut having killed their prophet, were utterly destroyed by tempests, and their city depopulated. And Pharaoh, strong for shocks As is a tent with tent-pegs driven deep? The Arabic word Watad bears this signification. Lo! these their haughty state did keep, And multiply their wickedness; Till Allah, who long-suffering hath, Laid upon them the scourges of His wrath. Verily, as a ‚Äúwatch-tower‚Äù is your Lord. Lo! if ye knew this, would ye shut your hoard When the poor cry; devour the weak; and love Your riches more than treasures stored above? Ho! when the earth's bones crack, And, rank on rank, the angels gather, And hell's black gates fly back, How will each say, ‚ÄúWould God in life's fair weather, I had bethought me of this storm of hell!‚Äù But then it shall be well For thee, thou soul! to-day uncomforted, Who know'st that Allah sees; And patiently awaitest till He please Call thee to comfort, praising Him and praised. Joyous thou shalt be raised To Paradise, hearing His angels say, ‚ÄúEnter, and be exceeding glad to-day!‚Äù Al-W√¢jid! ‚ÄúWatcher!‚Äù save by grace, Who shall attain that happy place? 66Al-W√¢hid W√¢hid!

Of none begotten, and begetting none, Who hath not like unto Him any one!‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, cxii. chapter ‚ÄúOf Unity.‚Äù Ya W√¢hid! Holy! Only! we Thus do declare Thy unity. 67As-Samad As-Samad! the ‚ÄúEternal!‚Äù by this name Laud Him Who will be, was, and is the Same. Of Heaven's prodigious years man wotteth nought; The ‚ÄúEverlasting!‚Äù‚Äîhast thou strained thy thought Searching that depth, which numbs the seeking mind As too much light the eager gaze doth blind? The years of men are measured by the sun, And were not, until he his course begun; And will not be, when his gold dial dies: But God lived while no sun shone in the skies; And shall be living when all worlds are dead: Yet hereof, though ye see the truth is said, Ye take no more the meaning than one takes Measure of ocean by the cup that slakes His thirst, from rillet running to the sea. Behind‚Äîbefore ye, shines Eternity, Visible as the vault's fathomless blue, Which is so deep the glance goes never through, Though nothing stays save depth: so is it seen That Allah must be ever, and hath been; Seen, but not comprehended‚Äîfor man's wit Knows this, yet knows‚Äînot understanding it. Mete ye not Allah's times by man's: life gives No measure of the Life Divine which lives Unending, uncommenced, having no stay Of yesterday, to-morrow, or to-day; Being for ever one unbroken Now Where past and future come not. Heard'st thou how, What time fair Zion was given to sword and flame, Ozair Identified by some commentators with Ezra of Scripture. the Jew upon his camel came Over those hills which ring the sea of Lot, The Dead Sea. So that one footstep and‚Äîye see her not, And then another‚Äîand the city comes Full upon view with all her milk-white domes. But the Chaldean now had spoiled the place, And desolate and waste was Zion's face, Her proud abodes unpeopled, and her ways Heaped with charred beams and lintels. Ozair says, ‚ÄúO Lord! who promised to Jerusalem Comfort and peace; and for her sons, to them A glad return, how shall Thy word be kept When fire and steel over these roofs have swept, And she, that was a queen, lies dead and black, A smoking ruin, where the jackals pack? A hundred years were not enough to give Life back to Zion! Can she ever live?‚Äù But while he spake, the Angel of the Lord Laid on his doubting front a fiery sword, And Ozair in that lonely desert spot Fell prone, and lay‚Äîbreathing and moving not‚Äî One hundred years, while the great world rolled on, And Zion rose, and mighty deeds were done. And when the hundred years were flown, God said, ‚ÄúAwake, Ozair! how long hast tarri√´d, Thinkest thou, here?‚Äù Ozair replied, ‚ÄúA day, Perchance, or half.‚Äù The awful Voice said, ‚ÄúNay! But look upon thy camel.‚Äù Of that beast Nought save white bones was left: no sign, the least, Of flesh, or hair, or hide: the desert grass Was matted o'er its shanks, and roots did pass From a gnarled fig-tree through the eye-pits twain, And in and out its ribs grew the vervain. But 'mid the moulderings of its saddle-bags And crimson carpet, withered into rags, A basket, full of new-picked dates, stood there Beside a cruise of water, standing where He set them fresh, twice fifty years ago; And all the dates were golden with the glow Of yestreen's sunset, and the cruise's rim Sparkled with water to the very brim. ‚ÄúOzair!‚Äù the awful Voice spake, ‚Äúlook on these! He maketh and unmaketh what shall please; Saves or destroys, restores or casts away; And centuries to Him are as a day; And cities all as easy to revive As this thy camel here, which now shall live.‚Äù Thereon the skull and bones together crept From tangled weed and sand where they had slept; The hide and hair came, and the flesh filled in, The eyes returned their hollow pits within, The saddle-bags upon its haunches hung, The carpet on the saddle-horns was flung, The nose-rope from the muzzle fell. The beast Rose from its knees, and would have made to feast On the green herbage where its bones had lain, But that it heard bells of a caravan Coming from Kedron, and with glad cry roared. Then Ozair looked, and saw‚Äînewly restored‚Äî Zion's fair walls and temples, and a crowd Of citizens; and traffic rich and loud In her white streets; and knew time should not be Reckoned 'gainst Him who hath eternity. As-Samad! Everlasting One! Thy times are good: Thy will be done. 68Al-Kadar Al-Kadar! He is ‚ÄúProvidence!‚Äù hereby The Lord of all things living magnify. When ye say Kismat, say it wittingly, O true believers! under Allah's throne Place is not left for those accursed three, ‚ÄúDestiny,‚Äù ‚ÄúFortune,‚Äù ‚ÄúChance.‚Äù Allah alone Ruleth His children: Kismat ye shall deem Each man's ‚Äúallotted portion,‚Äù from of old Fixed for his part in the Eternal scheme By those great Hands which all the worlds enfold.

Wot ye of Solomon's signet, graved of a sapphire in gold, Graved with the great name of God, writ on the blue of the stone? Wisdom and riches and power had he who that treasure did hold; Safe in the strength of the signet he sate on his ivory throne. Only King Solomon knew how the dread letters did flow, What was the breathing of Aleph, where came the whispering Yod; When he spake the ineffable Word, the sea-winds at bidding would blow; And the hills yield their iron, and jewels, and gold, at the naming of God. And out of the void of the sky, and up from the gulfs and the capes, And forth from the caverns of earth, and down from the mountains of flame, Flocked Demons with wonderful wings, and Ifreet of horrible shape, And Djins, with red eyes, made of fire; Divs, Peris, and Giants, they came. They came, at the call of the name, from K√¢f, that engirdles the seas; From the gloom of the tombs in the graveyard, from ruins on desolate ground; From the pool and the marsh and the forest; from poisonous blossoms and trees;‚Äî Monstrous or dwarfish,‚Äîconstrained, enchained, subdued, by a sound; The sound of the title of Allah, spoken so as the Angels speak:‚Äî Nor spirits uncomely only, and evil; ethereal bands Thronged down from their heavenly houses, the Great King's service to seek, Hearing that nameless Name which all things living commands. And the fowl and the beasts were fain to gather, each creature by each, When Solomon summoned hereby, pronouncing the mystical words. Moreover, their dumb mouths opened, and the fly and the bee had a speech; And he knew the heart of the lions, and learned the mind of the birds. Thus is it writ how he marched by Tayf from the Syrian land Through the ‚ÄúValley of Ants‚Äù and heard the cry of that people of clay, ‚ÄúHide ye! hide in the earth! for there passeth Solomon's band; We are many and wise, but we die, if the king's foot cometh this way.‚Äù And he laughed, but leaped to the ground, and bowed his forchead and said, ‚ÄúO Lord God! grant me to learn from the ant the wit to be meek. I am many and strong, and a king; yet Thou canst instantly tread The pride of this earth to dust, and the strongest to Thee are but weak!‚Äù Then he viewed the birds, and cried, ‚ÄúI see not amongst ye here Al-Hudhud, the crested lapwing; what doth she to linger away? ‚ÄúAl-Hudhud.‚Äù The Arab historians, Sale says, tell us that Solomon, having finished the temple of Jerusalem, went in pilgrimage to Mecca, where, having stayed as long as he pleased, he proceeded towards Yaman; and leaving Mecca in the morning, he arrived by noon at Sanaa, and being extremely delighted with the country, rested there; but wanting water to make the ablution, he looked among the birds for the lapwing, called by the Arabs al Hudhud, whose business it was to find it; for it is pretended she was sagacious or sharp-sighted enough to discover water underground, which the devils used to draw, after she had marked the place by digging with her bill: they add, that this bird was then taking a tour in the air, whence, seeing one of her companions alighting, she descended also, and having had a description given her by the other of the city of Saba, whence she was just arrived, they both went together to take a view of the place, and returned soon after Solomon had made the inquiry which occasioned what follows. ‚ÄúIt may be proper to mention here what the Eastern writers fable of the manner of Solomon's travelling. They say that he had a carpet of green silk, on which his throne was placed, being of a prodigious length and breadth, and sufficient for all his forces to stand on, the men placing themselves on his right hand, and the spirits on his left; and that when all were in order, the wind, at his command, took up the carpet, and transported ported it, with all that were upon it, wherever he pleased; the army of birds at the same time flying over their heads, and forming a kind of canopy, to shade them from the sun.‚Äù Ill shall it fall for her, who seeketh us water clear, If she find not a fountain for prayers before the ending of day! But they tarried not long until the whirr of her speckled wings Brought unto Solomon's feet the crested lapwing, who spake, I have seen a queen that is greater than any save thee, O King! In Seba she reigneth majestic, and glorious king ship doth make. There hath she a marvellous throne of silver, figured with gold, And the head of the throne is a moon in a jasper and emerald curve; For her people worship the moon.‚Äù And Solomon answered, ‚ÄúBehold! Little bird! if thou liest not, this queen shall the Merciful serve!‚Äù Thereafter the message went from the servant of God, the king: ‚ÄúSolomon, son of David, to Balkis, queen of the south: Peace be to them that follow the Name upon Solomon's ring; Yield thee, and worship Allah; cursed is the idolatrous mouth.‚Äù Then Balkis sent him gifts, of gold bricks, yellow and red; And beautiful slaves five hundred, with amber and musk; and a gem Drilled with a crooked hole, which never a goldsmith could thread; And a topaz of price, unpierced, and a diamond diadem. He bade the sea-worm eat a way through the unpierced stone; ‚ÄúThe sea-worm and the ant.‚Äù The legend is that Solomon used the teredo to bore his topaz, and, by filling the winding hole of the ruby with sugar and water, tempted an ant to draw a silk thread through it. And the little ant carry a thread through the ruby's crooked drill. ‚ÄúDoth she offer to Solomon gifts?‚Äù quoth he, on his ivory throne, ‚ÄúWe are richer than Seba's kingdom! By Allah!‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI will That one of my slaves bring hither Queen Balkis' jewelled seat; Thereby she shall learn that the glory is ours, and the knowledge and might.‚Äù Then √Çsaf the wise commanded, and a Djin spread his pinions fleet, And brought the moon-throne thither, and set it before them aright. In a guarded house she had shut it, which a thousand bowmen kept, But when she was come to Salem, lo! Solomon the king Sate there on her own gold seat, and Balkis bowed her and wept, Saying, ‚ÄúI pray thee, teach me the Name on thy signet ring! We have sinned against our souls, following lower Lords; Our kingdom we give, and our goods, and our lives, and our spirits to thine.‚Äù Such worship had he of old who knew Al-W√¢l√Æ's words Which rule the rulers, and knew the sound of the Name Divine. Cf. Kor√¢n, xxvii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Ant.‚Äù Ya W√¢l√Æ! Gracious Lord! impart True knowledge of Thee, as Thou art. 77Al-Mut√¢h√¢li Praise Him, Al-Mut√¢h√¢li! Whose decree Is wiser than the wit of man can see. 'Tis written in the chapter ‚Äúof the Cave,‚Äù Cf. Koran, xviii. An Angel of the Lord, a minister, Had errands upon earth, and Moses said, ‚ÄúGrant me to wend with thee, that I may learn God's ways with men.‚Äù The Angel, answering, said, ‚ÄúThou canst not bear with me; thou wilt not have Knowledge to judge; yet if thou followest me, Question me not, whatever I shall do, Until I tell thee.‚Äù Then they found a ship On the sea-shore, wherefrom the Angel struck Her boards and brake them. Moses said, ‚ÄúWilt drown The mariners? this is a strange thing wrought?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid I not say thou couldst not bear with me?‚Äù The Angel answered‚Äî‚Äúbe thou silent now!‚Äù Yet farther, and they met an Arab boy: Upon his eyes with mouth invisible The Angel breathed; and all his warm blood froze, And, with a moan, he sank to earth and died. Then Moses said, ‚ÄúSlayest thou the innocent Who did no wrong? this is a hard thing seen!‚Äù ‚ÄúDid I not tell thee,‚Äù said the Minister, Thou wouldst not bear with me? question me not!‚Äù Then came they to a village, where there stood A lowly hut; the garden-fence thereof Toppled to fall: the Angel thrust it down, A ruin of grey stones, and lime, and tiles, Crushing the lentils, melons, saffron, beans, The little harvest of the cottage folk. ‚ÄúWhat hire,‚Äù asked Moses, ‚Äúhadst thou for this deed, Seeming so evil?‚Äù Then the Angel said, ‚ÄúThis is the parting betwixt me and thee; Yet will I first make manifest the things Thou couldst not bear, not knowing; that my Lord‚Äî ‚ÄúExalted above all reproach‚Äù‚Äîbe praised. The ship I broke serveth poor fisher-folk Whose livelihood was lost, because there came A king that way seizing all boats found whole; Now have they peace. Touching the Arab boy: In two moons he had slain his mother's son, Being perverse; but now his brother lives, Whose life unto his tribe was more, and he Dieth blood-guiltless. For the garden wall: Two goodly youths dwell there, offspring of one That loved his Lord, and underneath the stones The father hid a treasure, which is theirs. This shall they find, building their ruin up, And joy will come upon their house! But thou, Journey no more with me, because I do Nought of myself, but all by Allah's will.‚Äù Al-Mut√¢h√¢l! Maker of men, Exalted art Thou past our ken. 78Al-Barr Praise Him, Al-Barr! Whose goodness is so great; Who is so loving and compassionate. Pity! for He is Pitiful;‚Äîa king Is likest Allah, not in triumphing 'Mid enemies o'erthrown, nor seated high On stately gold, nor if the echoing sky Rings with his name, but when sweet mercy sways His words and deeds. The very best man prays For Allah's help, since feeble are the best; And never shall man reach th' angelic rest Save by the vast compassion of Heaven's King. Our Prophet once, Ayesha answering, Spake this:‚ÄúI shall not enter that pure place, Even I, except through Allah's covering grace.‚Äù Even our Lord (on him be peace!); oh, see! If he besought the Sovereign Clemency, How must we supplicate it? Truly thus Great need there is of Allah's grace for us, And that we live compassionate! Hast seen The record written of Salah-ud-Deen The Sultan? how he met, upon a day, In his own city on the public way, A woman whom they led to die. The veil Was stripped from off her weeping face, and pale Her shamed cheeks were, and wild her dark fixed eye, And her lips drawn with terror at the cry Of the harsh people, and the rugged stones Borne in their hands to break her, flesh and bones; For the law stood that sinners such as she Perish by stoning, and this doom must be; So went the wan adulteress to her death. High noon it was, and the hot khamseen's breath Blew from the desert sands and parched the town. The crows gasped, and the kine went up and down With lolling tongues; the camels moaned; a crowd Pressed with their pitchers, wrangling high and loud, About the tank; and one dog by a well, Nigh dead with thirst, lay where he yelped and fell, Glaring upon the water out of reach, And praying succour in a silent speech, So piteous were its eyes. Which when she saw, This woman from her foot her shoe did draw, Albeit death-sorrowful, and looping up The long silk of her girdle, made a cup Of the heel's hollow, and thus let it sink Until it touched the cool black water's brink; So filled th' embroidered shoe, and gave a draught To the spent beast, which whined, and fawned, and quaffed Her kind gift to the dregs; next licked her hand, With such glad looks that all might understand He held his life from her; then, at her feet He followed close, all down the cruel street, Her one friend in that city. But the king, Riding within his litter, marked this thing, And how the woman, on her way to die, Had such compassion for the misery Of that parched hound:‚ÄúTake off her chain, and place The veil once more above the sinner's face, And lead her to her house in peace!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe law is that the people stone thee dead For that which thou hast wrought; but there is come, Fawning around thy feet, a witness dumb, Not heard upon thy trial; this brute beast Testifies for thee, sister! whose weak breast Death could not make ungentle. I hold rule In Allah's stead, who is ‚Äòthe Merciful,‚Äô And hope for mercy; therefore go thou free‚Äî I dare not show less pity unto thee!‚Äù As we forgive‚Äîand more than we‚Äî Ya Barr! good God! show clemency. 79Al-Taww√¢b Praise Him, Al-Taww√¢b; if a soul repents, Seven times and seventy times thy Lord relents. At the gates of Paradise, Whence the angry Angels drave him, Adam heard in gentle wise Allah's whisper, which forgave him: ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúfrom this fair place, Ye that sinned; yet not despairing; Haply there shall come a grace And a guidance; and in fearing Me, and following My will, Blessed shall your seed be still.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer,‚Äù v. 35. Know ye not that God receives Gladly back the soul which grieves? Know ye not that He relents Ere the sinner well repents? Terribly His justice burns, Easily His anger turns. Cf. Kor√¢n, ix. chapter ‚ÄúOf Repentance.‚Äù Spake our Lord:‚ÄúIf one draw near Unto God‚Äîwith praise and prayer‚Äî Half a cubit, God will go Twenty leagues to meet him so. He who walketh unto God, God will run upon the road, All the quicklier to forgive One who learns at last to live.‚Äù Ya Taww√¢b! for Thy mercy's sake, Us to sweet peace and pity take. 80,81Al-Muntakim Al-Ghafoor ‚ÄúForgiver!‚Äù and ‚ÄúAvenger!‚Äù worship Him By these two names, Ghafoor and Muntakim. Cf. Kor√¢n, lv. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Merciful.‚Äù O Men, of dry clay moulded, as the potter moulds the jars; O Djins, that We have fashioned from the smokeless fire of stars: What terror of the Lord will ye abide? He is Lord of east and west, He is Lord of south and north; And the seas obey the limits which He set them, pouring forth: What terror of the Lord will ye abide? Their white pearls, large and small, are the handiwork of Him; And the ships, with towering sails, by His winds and waters swim: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? But the earth and all her creatures shall die and be decayed; Only the face of Allah will never change nor fade: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? The face of Allah ruling in glorious array; For all things look unto Him, and He governs day by day: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? Yet will He find good leisure, ye twain! ye Djins and Men, To judge you at the judgment, O Clay and Flame! what then? Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? If ye can pass His gateways, east, west, and south and north‚Äî Which shut in earth and heaven‚Äîhasten ye! pass ye forth: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? But Life and Death enclose ye; by no way shall ye pass; A fence of flame shall stay ye, and a moat of molten brass: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? And when the sky is rended, red like a new-ripped hide, There shall be no accusing, admitted or denied: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? No yea nor nay! no questions! the sinner's brand is sin; Thereby shall he be known, and flung Hell's blazing walls within: Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? Flung by the forelock and the feet: ‚Äú‚ÄúThis Hell existed not,‚Äù Ye said. Now broil! and when ye thirst, drink sulphur scalding hot:‚Äù Which terror of your Lord will ye abide? But sweet for him who was faithful, and fear√´d the face of his God, Are the Gardens of joy preparing, and the gates of the Golden Abode: Which bounty of his Lord will he deny? With leafy branching fruit-trees are set those Gardens twain, And softly the streamlets warble, and brightly the fountains rain: Which bounty of his Lord will he deny? And the fruit of the Golden Gardens swings delicate, near to reach, Where they rest on their 'broidered couches, hearing delightful speech: Which bounty of their Lord will they deny? Therein are the shy-faced maidens, refraining their night-black eyes From any save that glad lover whose joy is their Paradise: Which bounty of their Lord will they deny? From any but that glad lover, that happy lord for whom Their mouths of pearl rain kisses, their lips of ruby bloom: Which bounty of their Lord will they deny? Shall the wages of righteous-doing be less than the promise given? Nay! but by God, the Glorious, the debt shall be paid in heaven! What bounty of their Lord shall they deny? O man! fear Him, magnify Him; Al-Ghafoor and Al-Muntakim. 82Al-Raw√ªf Praise Him, Al-Raw√ªf, Fust and Kind alway, Who knoweth how He made us of the clay. Say, ‚ÄúLord of all, to Thee Goeth our road; Require not of our souls Too much, dear God! Thou wilt not! what was earned Thou dost defray; And what was done amiss That we must pay; But ah! be not extreme With what's forgot, With error, or small sin. And load us not With burdens which we cannot carry, Lord! But favour, help, forgiveness afford.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, ii. chapter ‚ÄúOf the Heifer.‚Äù Tender His answers are:‚Äî (The ‚ÄúChapter of the Star,‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, liii. Ayat the Thirty-Third):‚ÄúThe heavens and earth To Us pertain, and We Will deal, assuredly, Well with the good, but with the ill in wrath. Yet not for each offence, Errors of flesh or sense, Shall there be judgment, children of the loam! Our mercy reacheth far; We know ye what ye are, And knew ye while ye lay clots in the womb; Sin, and be sorry, and amend: Who seeketh God shall find Him in the end.‚Äù Ever-indulgent Maker! we Praise for these words Thy clemency. 83M√¢lik-ul-Mulki King of all kingdoms! only Thou art crowned, Whose throne is heaven, and earth Thy footstool's round.

Three days before our Lord Muhammad passed, They bore him to the mosque, where he uprose‚Äî Painfully leaning upon Omar's neck‚Äî The fever burning in his cheeks, his mouth Dry with the wind of death, and that knit brow Shadowed with Azrael's overhanging wings. One thin hand on the mimbar-rail he laid, Speaking sweet words of guidance, precious words, The last which ever fell from those lit lips, Teaching his Faithful. Then he gazed around, And said, ‚ÄúYe men of Mecca, where I lived, Going and coming, testifying God, I shall die soon; I pray ye answer me, Is there among ye here one I have wronged? I have borne rule, judging in Allah's name, That am a man and sinful; have I judged Unrighteously, or wrathfully, or pressed Too hard in the amend? Let who saith ‚ÄòYea,‚Äô Make his ‚ÄòYea‚Äô good before my people here, And I will bare my back that he may smite. I have borne testimony for the truth, Not sparing sinners; speak, if there be here One visited unjustly; let him shame His Prophet now, telling the sin I wrought Before the assembly. I have gathered dues; Declare if I defrauded any here Buying or selling.‚Äù And no answer came, Except the sound of sobs and falling tears From stern breasts and the eyes of bearded men, Because our Lord would pass. But one arose, A hamal, with his cord across his back And porter's knot, who cricd, ‚ÄúAbdallah's son! Three drachms of silver owest thou to me For wood I bore thee after ‚ÄúRamadhan!‚Äù‚Äù ‚ÄúGood friend, I thank thee,‚Äù softly said our Lord, ‚ÄúBecause thou didst demand thy money here, And not before the judgment seat of God: Ill is it if men thither carry debts!‚Äù Therewith he paid his debt, kissing the hand Wherein the dirhems dropped; and so went home To die upon the lap of Ayesha, With glad face fixed on high, and holy lips That murmured, ‚ÄúAllah! pardon me my sins!‚Äù O ye believers! if our Lord did thus, Consider well! leave no unrighted wrongs Against the ill time when the Angels come, Monker and Nak√Ær, gliding through the dark, ‚ÄúMonker and Nak√Ær.‚Äù These are the two Angels who visit the dead immediately after burial, and having set them upright in the grave, question them as to their faith and actions, as before described. And set ye up for question in the grave; When Israfil his dreadful trumpet blows, Summoning to judgment; when the skies roll back Like a scorched scroll, and o'er the gulf of hell Al-Sir√¢t stretches, ‚Äúthinner than a hair ‚ÄúAl-Sir√¢t.‚Äù The narrow bridge which all must cross from this to the next world, ‚Äúfiner than a hair and sharper than a razor.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis bridge,‚Äù it is written, ‚Äúis beset on each side with briars and hooked thorns; which will, however, be no impediment to the good, for they shall pass with wonderful ease and swiftness, like lightning or the wind, Muhammad and his Muslims leading the way; whereas the wicked, what with the slipperiness and extreme narrowness of the path, the entangling of the thorns, and the extinction of the light, which directed the former to Paradise, will soon miss their footing, and fall down headlong into hell, which is gaping beneath them.‚Äù ‚ÄúMuhammad seems to have borrowed this from the Magians, who teach that on the last day all mankind will be obliged to pass a bridge called P√ªl Ch√Ænavad, that is, the strait bridge, leading directly into the other world; on the midst of which the Angels appointed by God will stand, who will require of every one a strict account of his actions. The Jews speak likewise of the bridge of hell, which they say is no broader than a thread.‚Äù And sharper than a sword,‚Äù and yet to cross! Ah, then! what good one wrought, he hath of help Even to a date-stone; what of ill he wrought, Of hindrance, to a date-stone; for your God Is righteous, and the distribution just. O just ‚ÄúDistributor!‚Äù incline Our hearts to keep Thy laws divine. 86Al-Jami`h Al-fami'h! praise ‚Äúthe Gatherer,‚Äù Who divides Evil and good unto their proper sides. Ye who believe, stand ye steadfast in justice, Witnessing true though it be to displease; Heed not your patrons, nor parents, nor kinsmen, Allah is nearer and richer than these. Sit ye not down in the seat of the scornful, Hear not the tales which the hypocrites tell; On the day when His children are folded together Al-Jami'h shall scatter the sinners to hell. Cf. Kor√¢n, iv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Women,‚Äù v. 139. We take Thee for our Shepherd; keep Safe in the fold Thy foolish sheep. 87Al-Ghan√Æ We praise Thee; but no need of praise Thou hast, Al-Ghan√Æ! in Thy glory bright and vast. Mighty is He and forgiving. Cf. Kor√¢n, xxxix. chapter ‚ÄúOf Troops.‚Äù One soul did He first create, Then He made therefrom a mate: And to help man in his living, Gave him herds, each with the other, Camels, oxen, goats and sheep. Think how Allah wakes from sleep The babe, close-folded in its mother! In three darknesses He shrouds it; ‚ÄúThree darknesses.‚Äù The body, the womb, and the amnion. Wonder upon wonder clouds it. He is Maker: can ye see All these tokens and still be Thankless? Yet, if so ye are, Not beholden to your care Is Al-Ghan√Æ: self-sufficing Lives high Allah, recognising Gladly all His creatures' love In a changeless peace above. Judge ye each for each; with God No man bears another's load. Unto Him is your return, Then shall every spirit learn What it wrought, and what is due; For He knows the hearts of you. Ah, Self-sufficing One! we seek To praise Thee well, but words are weak. 88Al-Mughn√Æ He is sufficient, and He makes suffice; Praise thus again thy Lord, mighty and wise. God is enough! thou, who in hope and fear Toilest through desert-sands of life, sore-tried, Climb trustful over death's black ridge, for near The bright wells shine: thou wilt be satisfied. God doth suffice! O thou, the patient one, Who puttest faith in Him, and none beside, Bear yet thy load; under the setting sun The glad tents gleam: thou wilt be satisfied. By God's gold Afternoon!

When God fashioned Paradise, Cf.‚ÄúThe Mishkat-al-M√¢s√¢b√Æh.‚Äù Spake He unto Gabriel: ‚ÄúSee this place which We created, Where the justified will dwell.‚Äù Gabriel said,‚ÄúMy Lord! I swear By Thy glory, none of men Ever of its joys shall hear But will strive to enter in.‚Äù Round about His Paradise God set sorrows and denials; Laid the pathway steep and strait, Hard to find and full of trials. ‚ÄúLook again!‚Äù God said; and he Looked, and came, and sadly spake: ‚ÄúBy Thy glorious majesty, Not one man will entrance make!‚Äù Then the Lord created Hell, Set ablaze its ache and grieving; Saying unto Gabriel, ‚ÄúThis is for the unbelieving.‚Äù Gabriel looked and said, ‚ÄúI swear, By Thy splendour, not a mortal, When of hell-fire he shall hear, Ever will approach its portal.‚Äù Round about those awful gates Allah set soft sins and pleasures; Made the pathway broad and plain, Rich with joys and gifts and treasures. ‚ÄúLook again,‚Äù said God; and he Saw; and spake, ‚ÄúSave by Thy blessing, O my Lord! there will not be One that must not love transgressing.‚Äù Lord of the two-fold roads, we pray Lead us upon the rightful way. 91An-N√¢fi`h ‚ÄúPropitious‚Äù is He unto those that show Compassion to His creatures; praise Him so. ‚ÄúNo beast of earth, no fowl that flies with wings,‚Äù Saith the great Book, ‚Äúbut is a peopel, too; From Allah sprang their life, and unto Him They shall return: with such heed what ye do!‚Äù There came before our Lord a certain one Who said, ‚ÄúO Prophet! as I passed the wood, I heard the voice of youngling doves which cried, While near the nest their pearl-necked mother cooed.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen in my cloth I tied those fledgelings twain, But all the way the mother fluttered nigh; See! she hath followed hither!‚Äù Spake our Lord: ‚ÄúOpen thy knotted cloth, and stand thou by.‚Äù But when she spied her nestlings, from the plam Down flew the dove, of peril unafeared So she might succour these. ‚ÄúSeest thou not,‚Äù Our Lord said, ‚Äúhow the heart of this poor bird Grows, by her love, greater than his who rides Full-face against the spear-blades? thinkest thou Such fire divine was kindled to be quenched? I tell ye nay! Put back upon the bough The nest she claimeth thus. I tell ye nay! From Allah's self cometh this wondrous love: Yea! and I swear by Him who sent me here, He is more tender than a nursing dove, More pitiful to men than she to these. Therefore fear God in whatsoe'er ye deal With the dumb peoples of the wing and hoof. Yours are they; yet whene'er ye lift the steel To slay for meat, name first the name of God, Saying ‚ÄòBi 'sm 'illah! God judge thee and me! God give thee patience to endure to-day The portion that He hath allotted thee.‚Äô So shall ye eat and sin not; else the blood Crieth against you.‚Äù Thus our Prophet spake, And Isl√¢m doeth it, naming God's name This is the origin of the Hallal, a custom of Muslim hunters and butchers, who pronounce the formula of excuse and pity before slaying any animal. Before the slaughter,‚Äîfor that white dove's sake. By those dumb mouths be ye forgiven, Ere ye are heard pleading with Heaven. 92Az-Zarr Az-Zarr! ‚ÄúHarmful‚Äù He is to them that sin Mocking the truth; O man! fear Him herein. Shedd√¢d, the son of Ad, of Hadramaut, Idolater, lord of the land and sea, Hath it come to ye how he mocked at Heaven, Saying the idols of the coast were best‚Äî S√¢kia that makes the rain, and H√¢fedha The Thunderer, Razek who gives grain to men, And S√¢lema, lady of life and death?‚Äî And how he sware an oath by those four gods, Drinking the palm-wine deep at Hadramaut, That he would build a better Paradise Than Allah's, and be Lord and God therein; With earthly Houris fairer than those maids Wrought of the musk and ambergris, who have The great immortal breasts and black-pearl eyes; With sweeter streams than Salsab√Æl, A stream of Paradise.and trees Richer in fruit than Tooba: The tree of Happiness, which grows from Muhammad's pavilion in Paradise. this he sware, Abiding not the judgment, nor the blasts Of Israfil, nor weighing of the scales. Wherefore he gave command that there be built In Akhaf, on the hills, beyond the sand‚Äî Within a hollow vale walled by wild peaks‚Äî A pleasure-house‚Äîbeautiful with white courts Of levelled marble, and in every court A fountain, sparkling from a tank inlaid With amber, nacre, coral; and around, In every court, cloisters of columns carved With reeded shafts and frontals, wonderful For beast and bird and fish and leaf and flower. And round about this pleasure-house he bade A lovely garden bloom, terraced by lanes Bosky with blossoming trees and rose-thickets, Where hidden streamlets murmured and gold fruit Loaded the boughs, and all the air was balm. He gave command, moreover, that there rise Hard by, with streets and markets, a fair town Peopled by ministers of pleasure, and walled With ramparts of the rose and pomegranate; Wherethrough there led a double folding gate, Fashioned of fragrant woods, and set with stars Of silver, opening downwards to the vale, Inscribed ‚ÄúThe Paradise of King Shedd√¢d.‚Äù And when the house was made, and all the courts Were girdled with the carven shafts, and cooled With leaping fountains; and the roses, blown, Filled the green vale with sweetness; and the town Was heaped with grain and wine, and people moved Busy and glad about its new fair streets, Shedd√¢d set forth. A shining line of spears, League-long, wound first upon the mountain-path; And after them the camel-litters, decked With silk and gold, and poles of silver, came Bearing the Houris of his Paradise; And next the Prince amid his lords: so clomb The gay march up the sandy steeps, or streamed Down the grey wadis. At the head of all Rode one who held a flag of yellow silk, Which had for its device, ‚ÄúAmid his gods, Shedd√¢d, the son of Ad, of Hadramaut, Unasked of Allah, wends to Paradise.‚Äù That night they entered at the silver gate, Making bold cheer; and sweet the garden was, And green the groves, and bright the pleasure-house Lit with a thousand scented lamps, and loud With dance and cymbal and the beat of drum. But when the golden horse-shoe of the moon Waned in the west, there came into the sky Three clouds; and one was white and had the shape Of a winged angel; one was red and burned Across the planets like a blazing sword; And one, thick black, gathered around the head Of a bare hollow mountain, seamed with gaps And caverns, wherefrom‚Äîfull upon their feast‚Äî Brake, of a sudden, flame and cataracts Of blood-red molten rock, with pitchy smoke Veiling the heavens, and rain of blinding dust, All pierced by livid lightning-spears, and driven By fierce winds, hotter than the breath of hell; Which sucked the streams, and parched the trees, and dried Life from the body, as a furnace draws The moisture from the potter's clay, while earth Rocked, quaking; and the thunder's vengeful voice Rolled horrible from crag to crag, and mocked The death-cry of those choked idolaters: Whereof, when the sun rose, there breathed not one; Nor any green thing lingered in the vale; Nor road nor gate appeared; nor might a man Say where the garden of King Shedd√¢d stood: So were the ways uptorn, and that fair sin Blotted from vision by the wrath of God. Yet to this day there lurketh‚Äîlost to view Of all men, hardly found by wandering wolf, Spied seldom by the vulture's hungry eye‚Äî The remnant of the garden of Iram. Deep in the wilderness of Aden, hid Behind wild peaks, and fenced with burning sands, The perished relics of that pleasaunce lie Which Shedd√¢d made, mocking the power of God: And one who tended camels in the land, Abdallah-Ebn-Kel√¢bah, seeking there A beast estrayed, followed her footmarks up Into a gorge, which split a cliff in twain From sky to sand, dark as the heart of night, With thickets at its mouth and jutting rocks. Therethrough he pushed, and when the light once more Glimmered and grew, he spied a hollow, shut In the gaunt barren peaks, with black dust strewn, And piled with cindery crags and bladdered slag, In midst of which lay‚Äîplain to see‚Äîthe bones Of Shedd√¢d's city and his pleasure-house; All with their withered gardens, and the gate Rusted and ruined; and the cloistered courts Swathed in the death-drift, and the marble tanks Choked to their brims; the carven columns fall'n Or thrust awry; the bright pavilions foul With ashes, and with remnants of the dead: For Ebn-Kel√¢bah passed into the place, And saw the valley thronged with carcases Of men and women and the townspeople‚Äî Not mouldered, as is wont, to whitened bone, But dried, by the hot blasts of that dread night, Unto a life in death; the skin and flesh Yet clinging, and the robes of festival Still gay of colour; all those sinful ones Slain in their sin even where the whirlwind struck: So that he saw the dancers as they fell With dancing-dress and timbrels; and the ring Of watchers round them; and the slaves who made Their music; and the bearers bringing wine, Each by his shrivelled wineskin, dead and dry. Also within the courts, lay corpses slim, Rich-clad and delicate, with jewelled necks, The Houris of that ruined Paradise. The sunken eyes stared, and the drawn lips grinned Under dead rose-crowns, and the shapely limbs Were grown too lean for the loose tarnished gold Of armlet and of anklet; dusty lay Strings of dulled jewels on their shrunken breasts; And brimmed with dust the cups were which they clasped In stiff discoloured fingers. In their midst Sate, all a-gape, King Shedd√¢d, for a throne Propped his dead form, and round the waist of it A sword hung, in a belt of gold and silk, Hilted with pearls and rubies. This he took‚Äî The camel-man‚Äîand glided, terrified, Back from that City of the Dead; and found The night-black gorge, and groped his way, and brought The sword and sword-hilt into Hadramaut, Telling the dread things seen of Allah's wrath Wrought on the misbelievers; and their streets Wrecked, and their painted courts, peopled with dead. Such awful end came on the men of Ad, Who made the House of Iram; and their lord. But no foot since hath found that road again, Nor shall; till Israfil sets to his lips The trumpet, and Az-Zarr will bid him blow. O Harmful unto mockers! we Know and adore Thy majesty. 93An-Noor An-Noor! ‚ÄúThe Light‚Äù that lightens all who live! By this great name to Allah glory give. Of earth and heaven God is the Light. Cf. Kor√¢n, xxiv. chapter ‚ÄúOf Light.‚Äù As when a lamp upon a height Is set within a niche, and gleams From forth the glittering glass, and seems A star,‚Äîwide fall the rays of it:‚Äî So shines His glory, and 'tis lit With holy oil was never pressed From olive tree in east or west. It burneth without touch of flame, A light beyond all light: the same Guideth the feet of men, and still He leadeth by it whom He will. Light of the world! An-Noor! illume Our darkling pathway to the tomb. 94Al-H√¢d√Æ Al-H√¢d√Æ! Lord! the way is hard, and we, Thy creatures, have none other ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù than Thee. By many names and guides doth God Lead men along the upward road; He, unto each land under Heaven, A prophet of its own hath given: H√ªd, Idris, Eyoob, Moses,‚Äîall Upon the self-same Lord did call; Seeing there is no way besides His way, the Guider of the guides; Nor any light to mortals known Except Al-H√¢d√Æ‚ÄîHis alone. 'Tis told, nigh to a city-gate Four fellow-travellers hungry sate, An Arab, Persian, Turk, and Greek; And one was chosen forth, to seek Their evening meal, with dirhems thrown Into a common scrip; but none Could with his fellows there agree What meat therewith should purchased be. ‚ÄúBuy uzum, quoth the Turk, ‚Äúwhich food Is cheaper, sweeter, or so good?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot so,‚Äù the Arab cried, ‚ÄúI say Buy aneb, and the most ye may.‚Äù ‚ÄúName not thy trash!‚Äù the Persian said, ‚ÄúWho knoweth uzum or aneb? Bring anghur, for the country's store Is ripe and rich.‚Äù The Greek, who bore Their dirhems, clamoured, ‚ÄúWhat ill thing Is anghur? Surely I will bring Staphylion green, staphylion black, And a fair meal we shall not lack.‚Äù Thus wrangled they, and set to try With blows what provend he should buy, When, lo! before their eyes did pass, Laden with grapes, a gardener's ass. Sprang to his feet each man, and showed With eager hand, that purple load. ‚ÄúSee uzum!‚Äù said the Turk; and ‚ÄúSee Anghur!‚Äù the Persian; ‚Äúwhat should be Better?‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, aneb! aneb 'tis!‚Äù The Arab cried. The Greek said, ‚ÄúThis Is my staphylion!‚Äù Then they bought Their grapes in peace. Hence be ye taught! But unto us Thy changeless name Is Allah‚Äîprais√´d be the same. 95,96Al-√Çzali Al-B√¢k√Æ Al-√Çzali! Al-B√¢k√Æ! praise to Thee Who wast before Beginning, and will be After the Ending. From Thy mercy came Man's breath, and unto Thee returns the same. Al Aar√¢f Cf. Kor√¢n, chapter vii. verse 172.saith‚Äîthe seventh of ‚Äúthe Book:‚Äù‚Äî ‚ÄúAl Aar√¢f.‚Äù The partition between Heaven and Hell. The chapter quoted says, ‚ÄúAnd betwixt the two there is a wall, and they shall cry out to the companions of Paradise, ‚ÄúPeace be upon you,‚Äù but they cannot enter it, although they so desire.‚Äù In the Beginning God from Adam took All who should be his seed, and bade them bear Witness upon themselves, putting His fear And knowledge in the hearts of all to be, As salt is set in all the waves of the sea. A countless, nameless, throng there gathered they, That unborn multitude; and God did say, ‚ÄúTestify! Am I not your Lord?‚Äù And those Replied, ‚ÄúYea, Lord! we testify!‚Äù Propose Never, then, Man! to say, ‚Äúwe did not have Guidance;‚Äù it shall be answered, ‚ÄúAllah gave With life that light which leadeth to the grave.‚Äù And in the chapter of ‚ÄúYa Sin‚Äù Kor√¢n, chapter xxxvi. it saith‚Äî Read in the Muslim's ear at hour of death: This Sura is recited at the deathbeds of Muhammedans.‚Äî A blast! and then an other blast! and, lo! At summons of the trumpet, all shall go Forth from their grave-beds, thronging once again Unto their Lord; and some, in fear and pain, Shall cry, ‚ÄúWoe, woe! what waketh us? Is this God's word come true?‚Äù and some, in joy and bliss, Shall say, ‚ÄúNow, praise to God! His prophets spake Tr√∫th unto us.‚Äù For all mankind shall wake Together, at the trumpet; and shall wend Together, to the Judgment, in the end. And no soul shall be wronged in that dread place For aught not wrought; nor any soul find grace Except for what it wrought; and there shall fall Endless delight in Paradise on all Who kept that witness! happy they shall be Recining with sweet consorts, 'neath the Tree Which bears all fruits, and groweth by the Throne. And they shall hear the Lord say to His own, ‚ÄúPeace!‚Äù‚Äîthey shall hear the Merciful say so. But to the sinners shall be thundered, ‚ÄúGo! Divide herefrom! did not ye testify?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea, dreadful Lord!‚Äù‚Äîthus shall they make reply, Descending into Hell. Thy mercy send, Thou, the Beginning and the End! 97Al-Warith Inheritor! all things proceed from Thee, And re-committed to Thy hands shall be. The chapter of Al-Hajar: Cf. Kor√¢n, chapter xv. verse 21. There is nought But from the treasury of God was brought; Such and so much He lends them; winds and waters; Have ye the store of these things, or of aught? Did ye set in the sky the starry band, Or pile the mountain peaks upon the land? Verily He hath made and will unmake them, And all these shall return into His hand. ‚ÄúO Rose!‚Äù the Dewdrop said,‚Äúwhence didst thou spring, That art so sweet and proud and fair a thing?‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom dust I sprang,‚Äù she said,‚Äúand ere to-morrow Back to the dust I shall be mouldering.‚Äù ‚ÄúO Dewdrop!‚Äù said the Rose, ‚Äúwhere didst thou gain This light, that like a gem on me hath lain?‚Äù ‚ÄúA cloud,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúuplifted me from ocean, And I must trickle to the deep again.‚Äù The Bulbul heard; ‚ÄúO Allah's rose!‚Äù it said, ‚ÄúThe air is fragrant with thee, being dead; O Allah's Dewdrop! ere the sea did suck thee, She was the fairer; be thou comforted!‚Äù For saith the chapter of Al-Hajar:‚ÄúTell My servants I have made the heavens well, And the earth well, and with a steadfast purpose; And Paradise is Mine, and Mine is Hell.‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xv. vv.49,85. Inheritor! all things are Thine; Al-Warith! O Thou might Divine! 98Al-Rasch√Æd Earth knows, heaven shows; the holy scriptures say, How righteous and ‚Äúunerring‚Äù is Thy way. ‚ÄúWe sent it down upon the ‚ÄúNight of Power,‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, xcvii, chapter ‚ÄúOf Power.‚Äù The Book which ‚Äúdoth declare.‚Äù In all the year that night is best: one hour Thereof, in praise and prayer, Is worth a thousand days of joy; for then The Angels bear commands, Bringing the will of Al-Rasch√Æd to men; Descending on all lands. Peace ruleth till the rising of that dawn, While Allah doth ordain How many souls those twelve moons shall be born, How many shall attain His mercy; for the books are brought of these, And each account is cast; And Allah maketh ‚Äúthe allowances,‚Äù Accepting souls at last.‚Äù Thus spake our Lord, And Ayesha replied, Cf. the Mishkat-el-M√¢s√¢b√Æh. ‚ÄúO Prophet! are there none Accepted, save by mercy?‚Äù ‚ÄúNone!‚Äù he cried, ‚ÄúBy God! I say not one!‚Äù ‚ÄúNot thou!‚Äînot even thou!‚Äîthou not to go, Unquestioned, into heaven, Who walked with Allah's Angels, and below Taught us the message given?‚Äù‚Äî He drew his cloth across his bended face, And thrice he spake to her: ‚ÄúExcept God's mercy cover me with grace, I shall not enter there!‚Äù O Al-Rasch√Æd! and if not he, Increase to us Thy clemency. 99Az-Zaboor O loving-kind, ‚Äúlong-suffering‚Äù Lord! once more We praise Thee, magnifying Az-Zaboor. Patient is Allah, and He loveth well The patient, saith ‚Äúthe Book,‚Äù Cf. Kor√¢n, iii.v.15 chapter ‚ÄúOf Imran's Family.‚Äù and such as dwell In kindness, asking pardon of their sins Each dawn, and pardoning the blameable. Isl√¢m! this is the Faith! thyself resign, Soul, mind, and body, to the will divine: The kingdom and the glory and the power Are God's, and God's the government,‚Äînot thine! There is no god but God! and He is All; And whatso doth befall ye doth befall By His decree: therefore, with fear and love Upon His glorious names devoutly call. Allah! His holy will be done! Isl√¢m!‚Äîwe bow before His throne. THE END.</field>
