      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST WORTHY, AND RELIGIOVSLY-NOBLE, Francis, Lord Rvssell, Baron of Thornehaugh, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eugenia. OR True Nobilities Trance, for death of the most religiously noble William Lord Russell, &amp;c. Inductio. Evgenia, seeing true Noblesse of no price, Nought noble now, but seruile Auarice, Lothing the basenes, high states euen professe, And loded with an ominous heauinesse: She flew for comfort to her sister Fame; Of whose most auncient house, the brasen frame In middst of all the vniuerse doth shine, Twixt Earth, the Seas, and all those tracts diuine, That are the Confines of the triple world; Through whose still open gates are ceaselesse hurl'd, The sounds of all things, breaking aire in earth; Where all mens acts are seene, each death, and birth. Eugenia, here arriu'd; her sister gaue All entertainement she could wish to haue; Through all her pallace led her, hand in hand: Shew'd her chiefe roomes to her, and bad commaund The best of those chiefe, and would haue her chuse: Ech chiefe, had diuers, fit for different vse, All with inscriptions of diuine deuise In euery chambers curious frontespice. Besides the names of euery famely, Enobled for effects of Pietie. Vertue and valour; none that purchase't name, By any base course toucht at t'house of Fame; Nor those that toucht there, stai'd there, if they lost The worth first in them, though they kept their bost: Such vanish like the seas inflated waues, Ech chase out other, and their fome's their graues. Amongst the solid then, that there indur'd; Eugenia (euen by subtile fate alur'd) Chus'd an inscription, that did highly please Seeing in fine gould grauen, the Russelides: Fame prais'd her choice, and said, the name was giuen By sacred purpose and presage of heauen, Expressing in the birth, th'Antiquitie Of that most virtue season'd Famelie, The word importing an effect of age, And long liu'd Labor; prouing the presage, That foresaw actions, which should Labors be, Wrinckl'd with time, and aged industrie. She here repos'd, and from the base world gone, To cheere her earthly desolation, The Heraulds, and the Registers of fame, Of life and death, and all things worth the name, (Th'ingenuous Muses) follow'd, and with them The cheerefull Graces: and of each extreame, The parting vertues: of all which, not one Would stay, when she, that grac't them all was gone, Religion flew before, for she being ground And roote to all acts, noble and renown'd, Their vaines bleede neuer, but hers, first haue vent, Shee's their plaine forme, and they her ornament All these together now in Fames old house, Which (though of brasse) is yet most ruinouse, They saw the sun looke pale, and cast through aire, Discoullor'd beames; nor could he paint so faire, Heauens bow in dewie vapors, but he left The greater part vnform'd; the circle cleft, And like a buls necke shortned; no hews seene, But onely one, and that was watrish greene: His heate was chok't vp, as in ouens comprest Halfe stifeling men; heauens drooping face was drest In gloomy thunderstocks: earth, seas, arrai'd In all presage of storme: The Bittours plaid And met in flocks; the Herons set clamours gone, That ratteled vp aires triple Region. The Cormorants to drie land did addresse, And cried away, all foules that vs'd the seas. The wanton Swallow Iirckt the standing springs Met in dull lakes; and flew so close, their wings Shau'd the top waters: Frogs crokt; the Fwart crow Measur'd the sea-sands, with pace passing slow, And often souc't her ominous heat of blood Quite ouer head and shoulders in the flood, Still scoulding at the Raines so slow accesse: The trumpet throated, the Naupliades, Their claugers threw about, and summond vp, All cloudes to crowne imperious tempests cup: The erring Dolphin puft the fomie maine Hither and thither, and did vpwards raine: The Rauen sat belching out his funerall din, Venting his voice, with sucking of it in. The patient of all labours, the poore Ant Her egges to caues brought: Molehils proofe did want To keepe such teares out, as heau'n now would weepe. The hundred-footed Canker-wormes did creepe Thicke on the wet wals. The slow Crab did take Pibbles into her mouth, and ballas make Of grauell, for her stay, against the Gales, Close clinging to the shore. Sea-Giant whales. The watrie mountaines darted at the skie. And (no lesse ominous) the petulant Flie Bit bitterly for blood, as then most sweete. The louing Dog dig'd earth vp with his feete, The Asse (as weather wise) confirm'd these feares, And neuer left shaking his flaggie eares. Th'ingenious Bee wrought euer neere her hiue. The Cloddie Ashes, kept coales long aliue, And Dead Coales quickn'd; both transparent cleere: The Riuers crownd with Swimming feathers were. The Trees greene fleeces flew about the aire And Aged thistles lost their downie haire, Cattaile would run from out their sheds vndriuen, To th'ample pastures: Lambes were sprightly giuen, And all in iumpes about the shortleas borne: Rammes fiercely butted, locking horne in horne. The storme now neere: those cattell that abroade Vndriuen ranne from their shelter; vndriuen, trod Homewards as fast: the large bond Oxen lookt Oft on the broad Heauen, and the soft aire suckt, Smelling it in; their reeking nostrils still Sucking the cleere dew from the Daffadill: Bow'd to their sides their broad heads, and their haire Lickt smooth at all parts; lou'd their rightside laire: And late in night, did bellow from the stall, As thence the tempest would his blasts exhale. The Swine, her neuer made bed now did plie And with her Snowt strow'd euery way her stie, The wolfe hould in her den; Th'insatiate beast, Now fearing no man, met him brest to brest, And like a murtherous begger, him allur'd; Haunting the home-groues husbandmen manur'd. Then night her circle closd; and shut in day, Her siluer spangles shedding euery way And earths poore starres (the Glowormes) lay abroad As thicke as Heau'ns; that now no twinckle showd, Sodainstly plucking in their guilty heads. And forth the Windes brake, from their brasen beds That strooke the mountaines so, they cried quite out. The Thunder chid; the lightning leapt about; And cloudes so gusht, as Iris nere were showne But in fresh deluge, Heau'n it selfe came downe: Yet all this was not, halfe due ominous state To lead so great and consequent a fate, As tooke from vs, this rare religious Lord; Since his example, euen th'Almighty word Strength'end with men; now Faith so faint is growne, Cold, and feeles feuers of confusion: And if we note that true Religion Crownes all our worth; without which we haue none. And that her truth is in so few exprest By life that answers, her true loue profest. That verball pleadings onely, make her thought A word, no Thing; example that is wrought Out of her being beleeu'd, and proues to be Both her, and her diuine sincerity. Who can enough grace? or see magnified His fame in whom it liu'd, who in it di'd? Forth then: this tempest past: Eugenia bled As it had raign'd blood, and so seconded, The watry Cataracts, that feare on feare Shooke the poore Guests of Fame: and then newes were Of this Lords death: At which all gaue a shricke That would haue drownd the tempest: it did strike Eugenia so: She fell into a traunce Whose deepe deiection, none could readuaunce: Fame in her eare, did such a blast inspire, Of her loues liuing vertues, as got fire In frosen death, and he came stalking in, Proclaiming lowd, the victorie of sinne. The virtues spake, the cheerefull muses sung, The graces held her eies ope, yet her tongue Denied her function: till at last, their crie Cal'd downe, religion, to her extasie, Who halfe intraunc't her selfe was; all the part She had of humaines pinde euen to her heart: And made her forme, as if transformd she were, Into a leane, and lisping Grashopper: As small and faintly spake she; her strength's losse, Made her goe lame, and leaning on the crosse, Stooping, and crooked, and her ioints did cracke, As all the weight of earth were on her backe: Her lookes were like the pictures that are made, To th'optike reason; one way like a shade, Another monster like, and euery way To passers by, and such as made no stay, To view her in a right line face to face, She seem'd a serious trifle; all her grace, Show'd in her fixt inspection; and then She was the onely grace of dames and men: All hid in cobwebbs came she forth, like these Poore country churches, chappels cald of ease For so of worldly ends, men zealous were. None (hundred handed) would lend one to her Nor had they one, to doe so good a deede: None will doe good, but where there is no neede All full of spiders was her homespun weede, Where soules like flies hug, of which, some would striue To breake the net, their bodies yet aliue, Some (all their bodies eate) the spiders thighes Left hanging like the onely wings of flies. She cheerd Eugenia, and would haue her speake, But she with her late blood lost, was so weake, She could not moue a sound, beleeuing then, That she no more should liue in Noblemen. Religion said she err'd, where none would come, And that griefe made her misse her way at home, He had a Sonne, so fitting for his place As left not through it all, the slendrest space: One that in pietie, and all parts of kinde His fathers person manag'd, and his minde, Op't his death's wound, powr'd fresh iuice through ech vaine, Refin'd his age, and made him liue againe. This since Religion whisper'd in her eare, (Though with her faint voice) yet it more did cheere Her daunted powers, then that shrill blast of Fame, With which death wak't, &amp; quicke amongst them came Then her soules motion, her soft phantasie, (That sence in act put, doth create) did plie Her spirits so, she felt her speeches powre A little retriu'd; euen thar night and houre. She lost her loue: that night, that doth forerun The labouring weeke in rest, and of the Moone Retaines her Surname; when (though still halfe dead) Her Noblesse forc't her griefe to let her head Rise from her Pillow, and for that night giue Way to her speech, in which she much did striue To iustifie the greatnes of her griefe Euen to her traunce, that from her tooke her life. Vigilia prima. And worthely; for who can liue and see A death so worth life? t'is impiety Not to pay griefe, as much to vertue gone As comfort to her deare fruition: Those Pores and Passes, that our pleasures lend, Let in our miseries, euen in natures end; Nay where she takes in ioie, at entries few Griefe enters all parts; euen the places due By health to pleasure: euery slendrest griefe From all our greatest ioies; takes th'edge and life: Must we to pleasures vow deuotions euer? Those indigent repletions, that will neuer, Fill though they burst? and then least satiate are When Surfet serues in their idolatrous Fare? Griefes, Sighes, and Teares, and Eiulations to, Consumptions, Traunces; all the bane of woe We should susteine; since loue of euery good In one all goodnesse; buies it with his blood, And you, Religion, whom the world hath pin'd To whose deiections, Spiders are more kinde Then Wolfe like Humanes; Those fain'd peruerse Bees That poisons suck from your sincerities; And clothe you only but to make them nests And nets to catch them liuings; what now rests? For your recomfort, no man liuing now Will any true care take of me or you. How then will this poore remnant of your powres This cut vp quick Anatomie of yours, This Ghost and shadow of you be preseru'd? Good life, that only feedes you, is so steru'd, That you must perish; T'is not Noble now To be religious; T'is for men of vow Giuen, and (indeede) cast out from this worlds ship To Whales and Monsters of earth's couetous deepe. They that get liuings by Religion, Must be religious; And who liues vpon Any demeanes, that eates not out their heart? If liuing be the end of lifes desert; Life future is a dreame; but of a thought; A Spiders web, that's out of nothing wrought: A paire of Tarriers so set Fooles a worke, And lighter then the shadow of a corke: And then are all things nothing to a man Of any reason; Life is not a spanne; All's fiction; all haue writ, beleeu'd, susteyn'd; Earth and great Heau'ne made, for a Good more fayn'd. Ambitious Bubbles, holding nought within But only Gawdes, and properties for sin; And doe by no necessitie contayne Iudgement, and obiect; lifes ioy, ills payne; Proportionable to our good or ill; All is an Animall, that hath no will To order all his parts, nor no respects; But hath peculiar actions, and effects, That from the whole doe no excitements take, Nor his impulsion their prime motion make: This 'gainst the common Notions Nature giues Our rarest Artists vtter in their liues: Of them, Great men hold, that must ignorant be; Skils superficiall, fit Nobilitie. By those graue Magnets, at the fountaines head Our Countrie states (the crooked streames) are led By them, the Rabble; and from hence doth rise Their errours maze: Each sees with others eyes: Euen Artists (borne with the traditionall streame,) Others of their coate trust, as others them: Not knowledge, but opinion, being their Guide; Not truth, nor loue of Truth; but lust and pride, Truth lothes to prostitute her selfe to men That doe but court, and studie Name and gaine, And if they doe not only, and past all, Entirely loue her; Shee will neuer fall, Within a kenning of the deepliest learn'd; Nay, least of all, shee is by them discern'd; For, they presuming on meere termes, tongues, fame, Much reading (which are noblest breathes t'inflame Her quenchles fire;) But shee being still in calme And her lampe nourisht, with so rich a Balme, As at the heartie, will, loue; Thought, takes fire, That seeke her first, and last; all base desire Of name, gold, honor, counted clay to her; Yet nought the slower come; if men prefer Her to the first place; and with such delight And such a sacred rage of Appetite; That sweetest sins to her, more bitter be, Then Rubarb, or the drugs of Thessalie: Without which Tests, to trie her perfect gold, All tongues flie vp in fume.) All such as hold Their skils of those Lordes, haue to Truth no right; But are with Tempests rauisht from her sight. A rout of things they know, but know them ill; Which Truthes loue, and Good-lifes want, argue still. Wise men, and Iust they are, that only know All duties that to Men and God we owe: Such was at all parts our most Noble friend, Both place, and practise from his Birth t'his end, Renowming him, with all things fit to be The Presidents of all Nobilitie. His Birth and Noble breeding, who needes show? Me thinkes euen the Antipodes should know, Noble, and Pietie passe, where nought hath past, And as they pierst past all things, stick as fast. How farre his worth they carried (when the arts Had laid their ground-worke) into forreigne parts, France, and infectious Italie, can tell; Through which he yet made way; and neuer fell (In Antick affectation of their guises, Nor (for their owne ends) impious deuices,) From the Religious Integritie His Birth, and admiration did implie In his vnchang'd powrs; But did arme the more His solid vertues; and their sleights abhore. Cold Rhenus, and Danubius streames he past Through Hungarie, and Germanie the vast; In quest of action; and the discipline Of brightly armes; In which, with grace diuine His goodly Person shone; And valour strooke Sparkles from steele, that fire at wonder tooke. In Belgia, The Nurce and Schoole of Warre, Through Sieges, Battailes, he made circulare His militarie skill; where, our great Queene (That with her little Kingdome, curb'd the spleene Of Spaine, and France; And with her mightie hand Made euen that most diuided Kingdome stand,) Gaue him her Empires pledge for his Command; And, in her owne Dominions, a Crowne Set on his Temples; in the high Renowne Of that full Gouernement, his vertues swaide; Which, wood-housde, wilde Rebellion obaide. Thus, as a Riuer, that the more his force Runs from his fount, takes vertue of his course, And growes more great and strong still; Nor doth stay, Till it mixe streames with his Great Sire, the Sea; So, till he matcht his greatest Ancetor, He neuer ceast to amplifie his store. His Fathers parts, all Fathers dues indu'd, As he did, all Sonnes offices include Of the good Earle of Bedford, the Sire gainde The surname; and the Good, the Sonne maintaynde. Heauen, in them Both, the Graces gifts emploide; What they consum'd, encreast; What gaue, enioyd. The vse; not the possession of things Commends their worth, and their encreases springs, And that vse must haue Influence from his ground Religion; with which, all his Arts were crownd. Nor could a man, distinguish twixt his deedes, And said; This Art, from Fortitude proceedes, This from Humanitie; This from Continence. But each, from all the vertues influence Had their composure; prouing the decree The Stoiques made; and we may iustifie; Each action, that a wise man makes his fruit, He doth with all the vertues execute. Some one, the ground-worke laying; All the rest Flow in as fellowes, with their interest. What man, not imitating him, can be Noble, or pious, in the best degree? Religion seasons all Nobilitie. Take that euen from the Greatest; you shall see How lanck he showes in his felicitie; For his Incharitie, he winnes no loue: For his Faiths want, to him none faithfull proue: For his felt ill, he cannot hope for good, But feare strikes euery shadow through his blood. What such men want, content with pieties shade, With that, and her heart, was this Lord, all made. In Noble being, and making good his place, Stooping for height, to nothing that was base. Nobles example haue, and Gentrie may Affect no Nobles, met with, in that way. Ignobles (if his worth he will appay,) May, (though most base) outreach Nobilitie. Obserue then, after all his high'st command How equall, and vnchangeable a hand He bore in thought of it, with things most low, For that he might to all example show: He made not height his end, nor happinesse here, But, as more high, more good he might appere, (Height simply, holding no good, much lesse all) He willingly from all his tops did fall, And, for Retreat, a Personage made his home; Where, (neare the Church) he nearer God, did come; Each weeke day doing his deuotion With some few Beads-folke; To whom, still was showne His secret Bedfords hand; Nor would he stay The Needie asking; but preuent their way And goe to them, t'enquire, how they could liue, And, to auoid, euen thanks, where he did giue; He would their hardly-nourisht liues supply With shew of lending; yet, (That industrie Might not in them be lesned, to relieue Their states themselues,) He would haue some one giue His word for the repayment; which (sweet Lord) He neuer tooke; nor askt a thankefull word. And therein, truly imitated God, Who giues vs Lawes to keepe; The Period Of whose iniunction, points not at his good; But, knowing, that when they are vnderstood, Their vnderstanding, by obseruing prou'd, Would make vs see; that in that Circle mou'd Our taught felicitie; Nor can we ad With all our obseruations; what may glad His still at full state, in the best degree, Other then this; That as Philosophie Saies there is euermore proportion Betwixt the knowing part, and what is knowne So joynd, that both, are absolutely one; So when we know God, in things here below, And truly keepe th'abstracted good we know; (God being all goodnesse) which with him combine, And therein shew, the all in all, doth shine: This briefly, for the life of my blest loue, Which now combinde is, with the life aboue; His death (to name which, I abhor to liue,) O sister, doe you, with your trump admire. As fame addrest to this; The morning came And burn'd vp all things sacred, with her flame. When now some Night-birds of the day began To call, and crie, and gibbet, Man to Man; Swolne fordges puft abroad their windie Ice, Aire, Earth, and water turnd, and all to Fire; And in their strife for Chymicall euents Made transmutation of the Elements. They blew, and Hammers beat, and euery noise Was emptying tumult, out of men, and boies. Bursting the aire with it; and deafning Th'Eare: The black fumes of whose breaths did all besmeare And choake the Muses, and such rude Clouds reare, As all the World, a Dyers furnace were. Gainst which, Fames Guests, their dores &amp; windows closde; As their poore labours were in earth opposde. Explicit Vigilia Prima. Uigiliæ Secundæ. Inductio, Now to the Nestfull woods, the Broode of Flight Had on their black wings brought, the zealous Night, When Fames friends, op't the windowes they shut in, To barre Daies worldly light; and Mens rude Din. In Tumults raisd about their fierce affairs, That deafen heauen to their distracted prairs, With all the vertues; Graue Religion That slept with them all day, to ope begun Her Eares, and red Eyes; hearing euery way The clocks, and knells of Cities, and the Bay Of Countrie Dogs, that mock mens daily Carck, And after them, all night, at shadowes barke. Though all Fames brazen Gates, and windowes stoode Ope day and night, yet had her tenderd broode Close in their priuate chambers, their owne fashion, Silence, and Night, doe best fit Contemplation. And as Fame said of old, that peacefull night The Gods chiefe day was, since their chiefe delight In fixt callure stood; Themselues in quiet still, Earths cares to pursue, to skale their high hill; So these poore labourers for the second life (Diuine powres imitating) all their strife. Spend for hereafter, and thereafter thriue: This vantage yet; These haue of men aliue, (These liuing dead to this life,) That as they Studying this world in chiefe, on this world prey When they haue praid; more then these fed with prayrs; So these that studie here, to be heauens heyrs. (Vertue and skill pursuing, in chiefe end). More thriftie therein are; and their oiles spend More chearfully; and finde Truth more with ease; For these are in the way: The couetous Prease Of Truths Professors, (in by-waies perplext) March like those marginall Notes that spoile the Text. These thirsting Fames report of this Lords death, The curious Dame, that weighs and locks vp breath, Formd in fit words (as God doth euen our thoughts That nothing of good men, may come to noughts) Addrest her to be ecchoe to his words Which (though not many) yet may teach all Lords; And neither strange, nor eloquent, nor new, Doctrine that toucheth soules, or saues, or kils, A good man dying, vtters Oracles. And now was fame, aduanc't past sight vpon A hill of brasse, that farre the sunne outshone; Day, and night shining; neuer going downe: Her browes encompast, with a triple crowne. Each ac't with Iewels, vallewd past mens liues: Her trumpet then she sounded, that reuiues Men long since buried: to whose clanges sing All the afflicted virtues, conquering All their afflicters, her triumphe brauer bore The arts (for armes) of all mens worth before; Disparag'd worths, shew'd there, the perfect things; And beggers worthy arts were blasd with kings: Desert findes meanes to vtter: Fame to holde Both arts, and words, most secret, and most olde: Nor doe they euer their existence leaue Nor any that their virtues loue, deceaue. Fame hauing summond fit attention: And all her guests into expectance blowne: Like the morne's trumpe: when day is neere inflam'd, She clapt her goulden wings, and thus proclaimd. Vigilia secunda. When by diuine presage, this god-like Lord Felt health decline: and knew she gaue the word, Through all his powrs; to make a guard, for death, Frends helthfell (sleighting still what followeth) Nobly perswaded (as themselues would be Toucht with the like effects of maladie, That his conceipt of weakenesse was too strong. He askt them, why they wisht him to prolong His needefull resolution to die; As if t'were fit to feare felicitie, Or that he doubted it; And all the chere The hearty Scriptures did inuite to, were Serud vp in painted dishes; and to make (Onely for fashion) sicke men, sit, and take, And seeme to eate to; though but as their banes, Onely to die accounted Christians. Hungry, to heauens feast come, and cheerefully Eate what you wish; Ile teach ye all to die: If ye beleeue, expresse it in your liues That best appeare in death; gainst whom who striues Would, faithlesse, and most reasonlesse denie All lawes of Nature, and Necessitie. No fraile thing, simply is; No Flesh nor blood Pertakes with Essence; All the flitting flood Of natures mortall; Birth and death doe tosse Vpwards and downewards, euer at a losse; Humaine Births euer are, and neuer stay, Still in mutation; we die euery day: Ridiculous are we then, in one death flying, That dead so often are; and euer dying. Ye feare your owne shades; they are fooles that make Deaths forme so ougelie, and remembrance take Of their dissoluing by so foule a sight, When death presents the faire of heauenly light. The ghostly forme, that in this world we leaue. When death dissolues vs; wise men should conceiue Showes well, what life is; farre from figuring death: Am I this truncke? It is my painted sheath: As braue young men, thinke they are, what they weare; So these, encourage men, with what they feare. Make death an Angell, skaling, of a heauen And croune him with the Asterisme of seauen; To show he is the death of deadly sinnes: A rich spring make his Robe, since he begins Our endlesse Summer: let his shoulders spring Both the sweete Cupids, for his either wing, Since loue, and ioy in death, to heauen vs bring: Hang on the Iuorie Brawne of his right arme, A bunch of goulden keis; his left a swarme Of thriftie Bees, in token we haue done The yeare, our lifes toile, and our fruites haue shone In hoonnie of our good workes, labord here: Before his flaming bosome, let him weare A shining Christall; since through him we see The louely forms of our felicitie. His thighes make, both the heauen-supporting Poles, Since he sustaines heauen, storing it, with soules. His left hand, let a plenties horne extend: His right, a booke to contemplate our end: This forme, conceaue death beares, since truely this In his effects, informes vs, what he is. Who, in life, flies not, to inheritance giuen? And, why not then, in death, t'inherit heauen? Wrastlers for games, know they shall neuer be, (Till their strife end, and they haue victorie) Cround with their garlands, nor receiue their game, And in our heauens strife, know not we the same? Why striue we; not being certaine to obtaine If we doe conquer? and because we gaine Conquest in faith, why faint we? since therein We lose both strife, and conquest? who will winne Must lose in this strife; in deaths easie lists Who yelds, subdues, he's conquerd, that resists. Each morning, setting forth to your affaires, These things commend ye, to our God in praiers: Direct me, God, in all this daies expence As thy necessitie of prouidence Thinks fit for me: what euer way you leade And point out for me; I will gladly dread; So being, thy sonne, and pious; sticke, and goe Compeld as slaue, and my impietie slow. And how most wretchedly shall those that beare Authority, and swimme in riches here, (Resisting death for them) be forc't in feare To goe with him; when all they can oppose, The insolent, and impotently lose? None of those men, that most spent oile and blood, With studie for ioies fullest tast in good In this life, euer could their longings fill, Their reasons strayning through their bodies stil Watrish and troubl'd; as through clouds and mists; And wrestler like, rusht euer on their lists; Too streight; and choak't with prease to comprehend The strugling contemplation of their end. He that with God did wrestle, all in night; Figurd our strife with truth here, for his light; Which seene, through death, being but a touch ith thigh Blessing both vs and our posteritie Who would not wish death? touching feare to die For my estates disposure (whose cares lie Heauie on some mens hearts) my sure hope is My sonne will make, my disposition, his: Acquiting me of any cause to feare. And (sonne) what of my constant hopes you heare Make spurs to proue; that what I hope, you are, I shall laue something worthy of your care: Nor wast, nor labor the encrease too much, Nor left your pleasure in their vse be such, As at their most, their too much ioy may breede: For you must suffer, the same naturall neede Of parting from them, that you now beholde Makes all my ioy in them, so deadly colde. Let nothing seeme to you so full of merit, As may inflame you with the greater spirit, Nor no aduerse chance, stoope their height haire, But in the height and depth of ech affaire, Be still the same, and hold your owne entire, Like heauen, in cloudes, or finest gould, in fire. To rise and fall, for water is, and winde: A man, all Center is, all stay, all minde, The bodie onely, made her instrument: And to her ends, in all acts must consent, Without which order, all this life hath none, But breeds the other lifes confusion. Respect to things without vs, hinder this In ward consent of our soules faculties. Things outward therefore, thinke no further yours Then they yeelde homage, to your inward powers, In their obedience to your reasons vse, Which for their order, deitie did infuse. For when the hadpiest outside man, on earth Weighs all his haps to ether, such a dearth He shall finde in their plenty, euery way, That if with solid iudgement he suruay Their goodliest presence, he will one thought call Of God, and a good conscience worth it all. Nor doth th'imagind good, of ill so please As that the best, and sweetest Images Faind to himselfe thereof he can make end In any true ioy, but doe euer tend To ioy, and grieue at once: what most doth please Ends in sence bodilie, or mindes disease. Why then should ill, be chusd by policie, When no where, he can finde vacuitie Of cares, or labors? no where rests content With his meere selfe? at no time findes vnbent, No, nor, vndrawne, euen compasse, his rackt minde, His bloody arrowes to, in euery kinde Tugg'd to the head, and ceaselesse shot away, At flying obiects, that make flight their stay? Horde gould, heape honors vp, build towers to heauen, Get Capps, and knees, make your obseruance euen With and aboue Gods (as most great ones doe) Vnlesse you settle, your affections to, And to insatiate appetite impose A glutted end, your selfe, from feares, and woes Manfully freeing, as to men that pine And burne with feuers, you fill cups of wine, The cholerique, honie giue, and fulsome meate On sicke men force, that at the daintiest sweate. Who yet, their hurtfull tempers turnd to good, Milde spirits generate, and gentle blood, With restitution of their naturall heate; Euen cheese and water cresses they will eate With tast enough: so make but strong your minde, With her fit rule; and cates of humblest kinde You tast with height of pleasure, turning all Perticular to the pleasure generall. Learne to loue truely, good, and honest things, And you shall finde there, wealth, and honors springs Enabling you a priuate path to treade, As well as life, in prease of Empire leade. Those deedes become, one greatly Noble best, That doe most good, and pinch his greatnesse lest, That sore not high, nor yet their fethers pull; Neuer superfluous, euer yet at full, That to eternall ends, in chiefe aspire, And nothing fit, without themselues require. But these are neuer taught, till they be lou'd, And we must teach their loue to; both being mou'd With one impulsion; and a third to these (Which is good life) doth from one doctrine rise. Liberall, and seruile, we may teach all arts Whose whole; some cut, into six hundred parts, Which I admire, since th'art of good life lies By none profest, and good mens fames that rise From that arts doctrine, are as rarely seene As Centaures, or sicilian Giants bene. For Gods loue and good life yet, as too true We proue, our bodies, meanes haue to imbue Their powers with carnall loue; will any say That God doth not as powerfull meanes conuay For his works loue, into it as doth man Into the body? the soule neuer can In no propriety, loue her contrarie: Life loues not death, nor death eternity: Nor she that deathlesse is, what death doth claime: If she then (by Gods grace) at Gods loue aime: May she not meanes claime by his liberall word (That promiseth his mercie will afford His loue to all that loue him) to obtaine That which she seekes therein, and hould the chaine Of his infusion, that let downe from heauen Can draw vp, euen the earth? the flesh is geuen A liuer that formes loue; And hath not she In all her powrs, one Christ-blest Facultie To be her liuer, to informe his loue? In all chiefe parts, that in the great world moue Proportion and similitude, haue place, With this our little world. The great worlds face Inserted Starres hath, as lucifluent eies: The sunne, doth with the heart analogife. And through the world, his heate and light disperse. As doth the heart through mans small vniuerse: The two vast lineaments, the sea and earth Are to the world, as to a humaine birth The ventricle, and bladder, and the Moone, Being interposd, betwixt the Earrh, and Sunne: Is as the liuer, plac't betwixt the heart And ventricle: if these then we conuert To a resemblance, with our bodies powres: Shall not our bodies Queene, this soule of ours, For her vse finde, as seruiceable parts In her commaund, with vse of all her Arts? All which are liuers to inflame desire: And Eagles eyes to take in three forck't fire, (That doth the dazeling Trinitie intend) T'inflame her loue thereof; In sacred end Her selfe being th'Eagle; And the Queene of Kings, That of our Kings King, beares beneath her wings The dreadfull Thunder, the Almightie word; All which (called fiction) with sure Truth accord. But if men may, teach all arts else but this Art of good life; (that all their subiect is, And obiect to in this life; And for which Both Earth and Heauen, so faire are and so rich; Yet this must needes want for me and discipline, Reason, and stay: and only fortune shine In her composure,) O want wise men eyes. To see in what suds, all their learning lyes? Not such as learne not: but as teach not right Are chiefly blamefull. Good life takes her light From her owne flame: He that will teach an art, Must first performe himselfe the leading part. Who kindles fire without fire? He that striues Without his owne good life, to forme good liues; Motions that all the sacred Booke affords But Conjurations makes, with holy words; That of the Tempter sauour, more then God: Temptations; Not perswasions brings abrode; With Tempests, thinks to conjure quick, dead coales, Torments, not Comforts, sick, and dying Soules. And as the windes, all met at wofull fires Kindl'd in Cities; stuffe with all their Ires Their puft-vp cheekes; Tosse flames from house to house; And neuer leaue till their drie Rage Carouse A whole Townes life-bloud, in a generall flame; Yet Tapers, Torches, all the lights men frame For needefull vses, put directly out; So, at the conflagration, that the rout Of proude, and couetous zeales, hath so enrag'd, In Gods deare Citie; Tempests still engag'd In spleenefull controuersies, daily rise; Cheekes euer puft with hollow pieties, The wilde flames feeding, yet extinguish quite, Of needfull good life; both the heat and light. Gods loue, that both inflames, giuen all offence, And heauens chaste Kingdome suffering violence. Which they incense, and plie with batteries, To point at it; and shew men where it is. When he, his sparkling forehead euer showes Where peace is crownd, and where no vapour blowes; Where patience, milde humilitie, and loue; Faith, and good workes, with douelike paces moue Vnder the shadow of his starrie wings; Proue all they owe him; Not with words, but things, Contention, cleane puts out zeales quiet flame: Truths doctrine rather should be taught with shame, Then such proude honors, as her manners change: Contempt, and pouertie, her battailes range; Plaine, simple life, more propagate her birth, Then all the policie, and pompe of earth. There is a sweet in good life, that must goe Arme in arme with it, which men should teach to. The end that should in euery Teacher meet, With his beginning; is to make good, sweet: Who with meere arte, and place, good life doth plie, Attempts with pride to teach humilitie. Humilitie, Truths salt; and supple Spirit That workes, and seasons all men borne t'inherit, The Kingdome, on whose blest shore my foot now Is gladly fixt; Let that then season you; It makes, and crownes true Nobles, and commends. Euen to felicitie, our births, and ends. Now threw the busie day, through humorous blood Her sensuall stings, and strooke the heart from good. Things outward, with the Mother of their Grace, (The gawdie light) things inward quite out-face, To this Pied worlds, austere, and woluish care, All things meere trifles seeme, but those that are. Eugenia, that from Fame might comfort take, Let Trance still shut her eyes, and would not wake. But heard all speech, like this worlds counsaile cares: As if shee heard not, and betwixt her eares. Twixt life, and death, shee lay still; This sowre sweet That pietic ministers, doth neuer meet With fit secretion, and refining here: Being like hard fruit, whose true taste ends the yeere. The most enforciue bare Relation Of pious offices, is held but fashion: Proude flesh, holds out, her customarie will, And yeelds, resisting; Moues without a will To comforts promist, and no bond but faith For the performance, and her suretie death. And this, euen in the weede Eugenia wore, Of humane flesh, cleft like the shirt of gore That figurde this lifes, Offall for the graue And makes the Noblest that indues it, raue. Explicit Vigilia Secunda. Vigiliæ Tertiæ. Inductio. By this, the Babell of confused sounds, (The clamorous game-giuen world) his monthlike wounds Felt leaue their raging; The sweet Euen had dropt Her silent Bala'ms in, and their gaping stopt. Mineruas Birds, whoop't at him, as he drew His many heads home. Sleepes wing'd Vshers flew Off from their Flitches; and about Mens noses Plaid buzz. The Beetle, that his whole life loses In gathering Muck, still wallowing there, did raise With his Irate wings, his most vnwieldie paise; And, with his knellike humming, gaue the Dor Of Death to Men, as all they labourd for. The golden backt, and siluer-bellied Snaile His moist Mines melted, creeping from his shell, And made crook't Mazes of his glittering slime, To shew in what paths, worldlings spend their time. All these, The Euening only, make their morne, And thus employ it, as mens mock-dayes borne. Abroade then crept, the world-scar'd broode of Peace, To greete Eugenia; whose Trance still did sease Her griefe rackt Powrs, which since her loue did make Iust ioy to her; Religion would not make. In midst of all her sable Chamber, lay Eugenia corselike. The despisde of day, (The Muses, Graces, Vertues, Poesie But then arriu'd there) on the Pauement by Sate round: Religion (as of that rich Ring The precious stone) did th'ends together bring Of their Celestiall circle: All so plac't, As they her Armes were; And shee them embrac't. All then, wisht Fame, to giue her Trump the rest, (Euen to the deaths word) of the liuing blest. Fame (like the Lyon-frighting Bird, in chere Proude to report parts, that so sacred were,) Her Rosie Throte stretcht, and did thus extend To his last motion, his proceeding end. Vigilia Tertia. Still looking, neuer stooping to his death, Like some great Combattant, that though giuen breath, Yet eyes his Foe still; No glance cast aside, To giue aduantage of a touch vnspied: So, those twice seuen daies, that his lifes Foe gaue His sicknes breath (though in his sight, his graue Gaspt for his dutie, in deaths instant deede) He neuer lay, nor wore a sickly weede. If Death of him gat; He of Death, got more; And fortified himselfe still with the store The sacred Morgazine yeelded: Where he found Weapons that grew; and made each word a wound, Of which he gaue his ghastly Enimie one To be his Trophey when the fight was done. Which was a frailtie in him that would faine Haue proued a fainting; But who growes againe Vp to his strength, is stronger far then hee, Whose forces neuer felt infirmitie. He chusde his Funerall Text, that shewd him strooke With some distraction; yet the forme he tooke From the most learn'd Apostle; chearde him so That deaths aduantage, prou'd his ouerthrow. The Prophet that was rauisht quick to heauen, And neuer fought with Death; Nor those foule seuen His vgly Ministers, in that extreme, Triumphs in so rich a Diademe, As he in heauen weares. The more wrestling here (The Garland won) the more our price is there. But in our worldly ends, so fraile we are, That we the Garland giue to euery care That doth assaile vs; each particular misse, Of that for which the body carefull is; Our other plenties, prouing meerly wants, And all that the celestiall prouidence plants Still in our reach; is to our vse despisde: And, only what we can not compasse prisde. When this fault sence proues true, as Reason saies; Why let we Sense still interpose delaies To our true Reasons comforts? Ruling so That either we must rage still in our woe, Or beare it with so false a patience, As showes no more our ease then our offence; Exprest in grudging at our penance still: Our grudging showne, in our no more curb'd will, To our most iust Imposers; then to leaue Moodie, and muddie, our apt powrs to grieue: Not, that we may not beare a suffering show In our afflictions, weighing grauely how We may dispose them to our best amends; But, not take so much sorrow as transcends Our healths; or shewes, we let griefe further goe, Then our Content, that God will haue it so; Remayning in such plight; as if we thought That this our phisique of affliction wrought More painefully, then with a healthfull neede; When our all-skil'd Phisition doth proceede So strictly in his obiect of our ease, (So he may mend vs to and soundly please) That not a scruple, nor the slendrest graine Of any Corasiue, shall rack our paine Past his full point of our most needfull cure; Weight, measure, number, all Gods workes assure. Which, not because infallible Scripture saies, We only may beleeue (though that cause weies More then enough to strengthen any Faith:) But God to euery sound beliefe conuaith A Regular knowledge; to informe vs how We may sustaine his burthens, though we bow Vnder their sad weight; which when once we proue; It will annexe to our beliefe such loue, That (as the Sunne, mists) quite shall cleare our care, And make our generall peace so circulare; That Faith and Hope, at either end shall pull And make it come: Round as the Moone at full. And this, doe many know, though (as t'is said By that most comfortable Truth, our head, After his Prophet) with the arte of th'eare; Yet, nothing vnderstanding yee shall heare; Yee, looking on; shall see, and not perceiue, As often our diuerted thoughts bereaue The vse of both those senses, though we be In reach of sights, and sounds; and heare and see: For as the eye discernes not black from white, Colour, from sound; till with a noble light The soule casts on it, it is made descrie; So, till the soules blanck Intellectuall eye The worlds soule rinseth in his actiue raies, And her Rac't table fills with formes; it staies Blanck to all Notions that informe vs how To make our cares with in comforts grow: Our fainting, in the free reach of our faith, And, in our lifes fixt peace, all feare of death. Which true light to this Lords soule, shining came And fixt him Rock-like, till his Faith did flame. His conflict past, he to the comfort went, That makes those Thornes, Crownes; The blest Sacrament, Of which, The powrefull consecrated bread; (That cheares the liuing, and reuiues the dead, Receiud, with feare, and faith; that one yoke beare; Feare, that awes Faith; and Faith that tempers feare,) Assum'd by him: This witnesse he did giue Of what he tooke: I constantly belieue; That as I take, hold, and by grace shall eate This sacred bread; So that flesh that did sweat Water and bloud, in my deare Sauiours side; I shall in this bread, all exhibified, In my Eternall safeties full effect, Take, hold, and eate, as his most sure Elect. To this effect; Effectually the Wine, (Turnd the true bloud, of the eternall Vine His most lou'd Sauiour,) Then, as fresh in powre As in the very instant of that howre, In which 'twas shed for him; he did belieue To his saluation; he did then receiue. Thus held he combat, till his latest day, Walking, and after; Conquerd, as he lay, Spake to his latest howre; And when no more He could by speach impart, th'amazing store Of his assurd ioies, that as surely last; His diligent diuine, desird a tast Of his still strong assurance by some signe; When both his hands, euen then wrought in the mine Of his exhaustles faith; that cround his Euen, And cast such treasure vp, as purchast heauen, For all that wants of fit Illustration to this most religious and worthy Lord; I referre the reader to the learned and godly sermon of Mr. Walker; made at his funerall. Thus his most christian combat did conclude, He conquering most, when most he was subdude. Yet, not to leaue him here; his funerall Deserues in part, to be obseru'd of all. In which, his sonne; his owne kinde zealous spirit Did with his honors, and his lands inherit; Whose pious nature paying manly teares, (Which stony ioies stoppe in most other heires) To his departure; whose attending close (Through dust, and heate) the bodie in repose; Next Euen; and the whole way to his home: Whose there, fresh deawing with kinde Balmes his tombe; Whose liberall hand, to nere two thousand pore; Whose laying vp, as his most prised store His fathers life-bought counsailes; all, as nought I will not touch her: None giues these a thought; But how his teares led others; all the Phane Flowing with such brine; seasoning parts humane Offerd to pietie, which kinde, dead to, now Yet here so plenteous; me thinks should not show Lesse then a wonder; and may argue well That from some sacred fount, these riuers fell: O why wept, mans great Patterne for his friend, But these affections, grauely to commend? But these things now are nothing; the proud Morne Now on her typtoes, view'd this stuffe, which skorne. Scripture examples; parts of manlie kinde; The most vpright flames of the godlike minde; Like winter lightnings are; that doe portend Wretched euents, to all men they commend; All things inuerted are; nought brookes the light But what may well make blush the blackest night. Explicit Vigilia Tertia. Uigiliæ Quartæ &amp; vltimæ. Inductio. The tast of all ioies in societie The sicke world felt a little satisfie: The garland, and the Iuie-twisted lance, Put on, and tost were, by the God of dance. Vulcan guilt houses, th'Elutherian feast Of all the liberals: now paid Rites to rest. Songs, Hymenrals, all the cares of day Tumults, and quarrels, turnd to peace and play Representation that the Chymists part Plaies in her pastimes, now turnd with her Art This Iron world into the goulden age, Earths antient worthes, showing on her stage: Where those sweete swarmes that tast no crabbed lacks Hang thicke, with all their honnie on their backs, Imbrac't with musicke, and the pride of wit: Silence much more in solemne state doth sit In that faire concourse, with an Actors voice, Then where Rich Law insults, still vext with noise, And where nine Herolds could not crowne her peace, One Prologue here, puts on her wreath with ease. Loue ioies began to burne; and all did rise To giue the thriftlesse euening sacrifice. Then went the muses, virtues, graces on The Herse and Toombe, the croune to set vpon Of this most endlesse noble Lord deceast, And to his soules ioy, and his bodies rest A Hymne aduaunce, which to the Trumpe of Fame, Poore Poesie sung; Her euery other dame (Th'ingenuous Muses) ringing out, the Chore; Fame sounded; Poesie, sung the part before: Hymnus ad D. Russelium defunctum [1] Rising and setting, let the sunne Grace whom we honor; And euer at her full, the Moone Assume vpon her, The forme his Noblesse did put on; In whose Orb, all the vertues shone, With beames decreasing neuer; Till faith, in her firme Rocke reposde; Religion, his lifes Circle closd, And opened life for euer. Earth, seas, the Aire, and Heauen, O heare These Rites of ours, that euery yeare, We vow thy Herse, And breath the flames of soules entire, Thrice Het, with heauens creating fire, In deathlesse verse. 2 Rvssell, Lord Russell, while we pay Thy name our numbers: Directed by the eye of day That neuer slumbers: May all Heauens Quire of Angels sing, And glorifie in thee, their king That death with death subdueth; While we strike Earths sounds dumbe, and deafe, And Croune thee with a feastfull leafe Whose verdure still reneweth. Earth, Seas, the Aire, and Heauen, O heare, These Rites of ours, that euery yeare We vow his Herse; And breath the flames of soules entire, Thrice het, with heauens creating fire In deathles vierse. 3 Euer O euer may this Eue That we keepe holy, Thy name encreasing honors giue, That serue it solely. And second with diuine encrease Thy progenies religious peace, Zeales Altars euer smoking; And their true Pieties excite With full draughts of celestiall light. Thy vertues still inuoking, Earth, Seas, the Aire, and Heauen O heare These Rites of ours, that euery yeare We vow his Herse, &amp;c. 4 Requests that Iustice would fulfill Great Giuer giue them, Vniust moodes, make them bridle still And here, out liue them. Directly let their zealous praiers Her euen ope in their blest affaires, And of their Noblest Father; Enable them to fill the Place; And euery one; proofes of his Race From his Example gather. Earth, Seas, the Aire and Heauen, O heare These rites of ours that euery yeare We vow his Herse, &amp;c. 5 Honors, that vertues keepe in height With sires deceased; All know, make vp their Comforts weight, And them more blessed. And therefore in thus wishing thine, We wish the more, thy worth may shine, Great Grace of all men Noble; From whose life, faith, and zeale did flow, In whose death, they shall freshly grow, And thy blest Race redouble. Earth, Seas, the Aire, and Heauen, &amp;c. 6 Monsters, for Nobles, let the Earth, Bring forth to brand her; And their Adulterate Beastly Birth At swindge commaund her. Yet slaues made to their Lusts, and Hell They shall but here, like Giants dwell, And breede but flames, and Thunder To beate them vnder their owne Hils, Their sweetes turnd Torments, their Goods, ils, Thy Race, their Enuies wonder. Earth, Seas, the Aire, &amp;c. 7 Exult, and triumph then in all Thy thoughts intended, Which heauen did into Ioies exhall For thee, ascended. If not a haire, Much lesse a thought Shall losse claime, of what Goodnesse ought, But shine in heauen together; Whose ioies (to truely-studied soules) Shall shine euen here, like ashe-kept Coles, Laid open gainst the weather. Earth, Seas, the Aire, &amp;c. 8 Knowledge, not fashiond here to feele Heauens promist pleasure; In lifes sea, is a turnd vp Keele With all her Treasure: Not One, return'd from Death, to tell The Ioies of Heauen, the paines of Hell, Can ad to that relation; Which (possible impulsions vs'd The Soule knowes here: and spirits infus'd, Farre past her first creation. Earth, Seas, the Aire, &amp;c. 9 Infuse this into his deare kinde, Truth's free vnfolder: With Fire that first informd the minde, Now nothing coulder. For which the Thrice Almighty One: The Spirit, Sire, and word still done: Praise giue, that gifts transcendeth. Despisd soules, Comfort with thy loue: In whom, with thy first motion moue, Till in fixt truth it endeth: Earth, Seas, the Aire, and Heauen, O heare, These Rites of ours, that euery yeare, We vow thy Herse: And breath the flames of soules intire, Thrice het with heauens creating Fire, In deathlesse verse, Explicit Hymnus. With this, Eugenia, from her Trance arose And in her loues assur'd Ioies did repose, Her Noble Sorrowes, being assur'd with al That no effect did memorably fall, From his Renown'd Example, but was found In his true Sonne, and would in him resound. Then left she straight Fames loftie region: Stoop't Earth, and vowd to dwell with him, or None, Whom since the Muses, Vertues, Graces now, Of force must follow (sweete Lord) be not you Carelesse of them, that she esteemd so deare: For howsoeuer they to Earth appeare, Where in their Truth they are, and are not prisd, In them, is true Religion despisd Remember your Religious Father then, And after him: Be you the man of men. To these, the Night, thus short sem'd, and thus bare Was euery clamorous worldling, at his care, Care cried in Citties, and in Countries ror'd: Now was the soule, a Toie; Her gifts abhor'd, All Ornament, but brauery, was a staine: Nought now akinne to wit, but Cosening Gaine. Crafts, and Deceipts enricht, made Arts so poore: Which Artists seeing: Rich apparraile were And bore out Art, Light's onely made for show And show for Lightnesse; Grauest Booke Men now Most rich in show bee, for their approbation, And neuer swagger, but in sacred Fashion. Looke blancke on good life: and point-blancke on thrift: He that is richest, hath the wholiest gift. In Night Men dreame: Day best showes what is fit Learning was made for Gaine, Not Gaine; for it. Now bellies deafned eares, in euery streete, And backes bore more then heads, heads more then feete. Explicit Eugeniæ Ecstasis Musa quæ Inuidia? FINIS.</field>
