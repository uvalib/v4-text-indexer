      <field name="fulltext">GIDEON; OR, The PATRIOT. BOOK I. I. Glowing pure, with hallow'd Fire, Seek, O Soul! some heav'nly Theme: But, bid no Muse thy Flights inspire; Vain the Hope, the Name a Dream. Thou! Great, Almighty Spirit! tune my Verse; Accept my Off'ring, sacred to thy Praise: And while, unfit, thy Wonders I rehearse, Strike Thy keen Lustre, sparkling, through my Lays. Long, too long! the wand'ring Art, Aw'd by Power, by Beauty charm'd, Low has stoop'd to sooth the Heart: And, with a smoaky Fire, the Passions warm'd. But Thou! Great Origin of Harmony! Breathe through my Numbers a diviner Strain: And, as thy Servant Gideon, bless'd by Thee, Broke his freed Country's hard-oppressive Chain, So, now, all-pow'rful Guide! invig'rate me, Successful, to redeem the Use, of long-lost Poetry! Thou, the Great Author, of the Theme I chuse, Inspire me, to describe it well: and be, Thyself, my Muse. II. War is my Subject: and That fav'rite Hand Which, arm'd by Heav'n, redeem'd a chosen Race; When, scarce yet warm in their new-gifted Land, Wilful they started from protective Grace. At length, provok'd, their High Deliv'rer vow'd To pay with sharp Revenge their dull Disdain: And, while, to Baal and Ashtaroth, they bow'd, Justly, he bent their stubborn Necks to Pain: And left 'em Slaves, to serve the Men, whose Gods they serv'd in vain. Then, Gideon, wise and generous Leader! rose; And taught faint Israel, by his strange Success, That Loss of Freedom, from Corruption flows: And Virtue's Sense restor'd, repels Distress. Greatly determin'd, and sublimely brave, From a low Fortune, and a Race obscure, He, who well the Diff'rence knew, 'Twixt being base, and being poor, Dar'd noblest Hopes, with humblest Means, pursue: Shew'd the just Pref'rence of a balanc'd Power, Where Prince and Senate pause, o'er weigh'd Debate; To those blown Clouds which o'er Dominion lowre, Where headless Hands, disjointly rash, perplex a struggling State. When Sons of Faction, born to mis-compose, Dar'd, proudly wanton, bid Rebellion reign; Unvers'd in Rule, while o'er their Friends they rose, To fall disgraceful, at the Feet of Foes, Him, did the God of nobler Hopes ordain: He, when his Country's just Despair scarce Heav'n's high Aid implor'd, Redeem'd, Alone, th'unhoping Land: and her lost Law restor'd. Hail, divine Impulse!—I thy Force obey. Hail, glorious Theme, mark'd out by Heav'n, Heav'n's Influence, to display! And Thou, directive Spirit! shine: to point my blazing Way. III. But, while I rouse th'immerg'd in Doubt, God's wond'rous Paths to see, What human Power shall I invoke, for Aid? What Patron, to protect my Verse, and me, And lead lost Taste, through Discord's eyeless Shade? Why ask I this?—Shame, on the low Desire! Not Earth's dim Fuel feeds celestial Fire. Shine clear, my Soul! shun Flatt'ry's reptile Way: Nor court th'imperious Puddlers, of a Day. On strong Foundation, thy white Building raise: Nor stain thy Subject by misguided Praise. Not to Pride's transient Phantoms, poorly, kneel: But, bid thy Work, that hopes immortal Fame, Outsoaring Arrogance, to Worth appeal: And bow, before some world-ennobling Name. IV. Hail, Bolingbroke!—from thy still Heights descend; Come, Virtue's Heart, Wit's Soul, and Reason's Friend! All the charm'd Muses Thine, the Least, now hear. Why should they stoop to Kings, while Thou art near? O, come—What Name shall influent Rapture find? Great luminary Leader, of the Mind! Ev'n could the Poet please, the Power were stole; Thy Sense of Freedom stretch'd his Muse's Soul. Erring, where Thousands err'd, in Youth's hot Start, Propulsive Prejudice had warp'd his Heart; Bold, and too loud he sigh'd, for high Distress, Fond of the Fall'n, nor form'd to serve Success; Partial to Woes, had weigh'd their Cause too light, Wept o'er Misfortune—and misnam'd it, Right: Anguish, attracting, turn'd Attachment wrong, And Pity's Note mis-tun'd his devious Song. Timely, thy home-bent Radiance, re-display'd, Struck the dim Doubter, and dispell'd the Shade. Cool-ey'd Reflection check'd th'enthusiast Rhyme, And won the blushful Bigot, from his Crime. —Oh! as his Heart, then, catch'd thy Patriot Glow, Now, could his Verse, like thy sweet Accents, flow, Music's whole Power should strike the vocal String, And ev'ry Bird of Pindus clap the Wing. Guided, he mark'd the interposing Mound, Which Licence bursting, Liberty were drown'd: Which Monarchy, transcending, tow'rs to fall; And, grasping more than granted, gives up All. —Happiest of Men! most rais'd of Sov'reigns! He, Liege-Lord of Lovers! Foremost of the Free! Who scorns Prerogative, to taint his Will, And reigns o'er ev'n the Power, to purpose ill. Who shows majestic Royalty's plain Face, With Dignity's unmask'd, paternal Grace; Secur'd of Rev'rence, spurns tyrannic Awe, And stars his Heav'n of Pow'r with Lights of Law; Safely displuming Pride's imperious Crest, And lodging Sense of Greatest, but in Best. V. Such were a St. John's Thoughts—such, once, his Crimes, Doom'd, like a Lapland Sun, to down-bent Climes. Strait was his Beam, but every breaking Ray, Lost on th'oblique Declension, seem'd to stray. —Off with the veily Metaphor's cold Shade! Plain, to the Great, be Truth's pure Homage paid. Malice, Disguise, and Fear, to Courts resign; Warmth, in Thy Monarch's Cause, O Muse! be Thine. Censures, Resentments, Calumnies, and Hate, And all th'unlasting Levities of State, Transient, as Dreams, shall break their Mists away, And leave him glitt'ring, in unclouded Day. Feel him, O Thames! to thy fam'd Stream, so nigh, Bow thy prone Surge, and glide in Rev'rence by. Calm, on thy Bank, in patient Pain, he smiles, Effus'd, like Thee, the Boast of Regal Isles: Next Neighbour to his God! who (close behind) Breathes the still Altar's Influence o'er his Mind: Swells his forgiving Heart with Joy to bless; And bids him teach his Foes to shun Distress. Pride of a Land, those Foes were born to stain! Envy's vast Object! that o'ercharg'd a State, Till Debt's proud Blush turn'd Gratitude to Pain, And Wrongs, and Distance, eas'd thy dreaded Weight. What shall I say, Sensations to reveal, Which, Words not reaching, Thought but aches, to feel? All I can be, be Thine!—Th'Eternal Eye, That wakes for Virtue, sees, and loves, thy Claim: Kingdoms shall rise, and in slow Ruins lie, While new ones, in new Tongues, transmit thy Name. VI. O, never to be lost!—Could Wishes save, Nations would guard Thee from th'all-cov'ring Grave: But, 'twill not be.—Th'impatient Moments fly; Nations, and Times, and St. John's Self, must die. Die, to his Friends;—Himself Fate strikes in vain; Death but th'Accession, of his dateless Reign. When All those sacred Atoms sleep in Dust, If Earth e'er veils Thee,—as, too sure! it must: Sons of thy Soul shall each dear Remnant boast; And he charm surest, who retains Thee most. Realms, in Thy lucid Track, absolv'd from Night, Shall blush for Blindness, that repell'd such Light; Live to each Sense, thy faultless Taste inspir'd, And bless that Leisure, which thy Wrongs acquir'd. Freedom's broad Temple, in this bright'ning Isle, Pillar'd, on Props, by honour'd St. John rear'd, High, on the Front of her enduring Pile, Shall wear th'immortal Name, through Time, rever'd. Then, shall some happier Bard, all-friended, rise, Whom ev'ry Muse shall aid, to touch thy Praise: He, sweetlier-voic'd, shall these low Strains despise, For All thy tuneful Soul shall warm his Lays. Mean while, O deign, through death-doom'd Æra's bright, Buoyant, to bear aloft my Speck of Light; Then, shall I float sustain'd, in this bless'd Page, And one sav'd Poet 'scape a sinking Age. VII. NOW from the swarming East, for Sev'n long Years, Had restless Midian pour'd her swarthy Hosts: And, planting Canaan with erected Spears, Aw'd fainting Israel, to her Western Coasts. To These, old Amalek her Standards join'd; The marching Hebrews first, and surest, Foe! Thick, as the Locusts, in some living Wind; A Tide of Death, o'er all the Land, they flow: Force, and Famine, with them go! Pangless, they stain their Front with Blood: and blot their Rear with Woe. By God forsaken, God's proud People fly; Valiant, no longer than obedient, found: Hopeless to live, and yet afraid to die, In Caves, and dark Retreats, they dwell on high. Thence, prone, look trembling with pale Horror round, While, from th'expos'd inferior Ground, Their heavy Harvests load the plund'ring Foe: And for Support of Those they curse, their Grapes and Olives grow. Dejected now, their Joshua they forget, Nor longer, warlike, others Lands invade: Anxious now, their own they quit, Poorly from reachless Rocks, to borrow Aid: And, hid in Safety's eyeless Dusk, their boasted Glory shade. VIII. Westward from rev'rend Jordan's silv'ry Stream, Where Half the Manasæan Tribe their measur'd Portion found, Ophra salutes the Morning's op'ning Beam, From the East Brow of an extended Round Of high-rais'd, rugged, and imperial Ground. Within th'extensive Circle, copious Plain, And safe-stretch'd Pastures, high-inclos'd, remain Impregnably secure, beneath th'exterior Mound. Far to the North, below, was Jezreel's Valley spread: Jezreel, by mighty Victories renown'd! 'Twas on this Mountain's broad and fertile Head, Joash, the destin'd Hero's Father, dwelt: Joash, whom home-rais'd Harvests nobly fed; Who, old in Ease, no Blast of Care had felt; Crown'd with unenvy'd Plenty, and Respect, He held a Power, by no proud Faction check'd; And, sole, and nat'ral Monarch of the Place, Reign'd in paternal Majesty, o'er all his happy Race. Hard by his House, a rev'rend Oak there grew, Which there had flourish'd, many a Cent'ry past; Long before Israel GOD, or Moses, knew, Or from Egypt's Chain withdrew, This Tree a Shade o'er half the Mountain cast. Stretch'd on a Bench, beneath th'expansive Gloom, Gideon, whose struggling Anguish long'd for Vent, Lay, at the earliest Dawn of doubtful Light, A far Discerner, unexpos'd to Sight; On mighty Ends, in Contemplation, bent. IX. The Morning rising over Israel's Spoils, Glow'd with a burning Blush, to see her Shame: The wakeful Bees began their searchful Toils, And humm'd, from Flow'r to Flow'r, with tasteful Aim. High to the bright'ning Skies the soaring Lark Rose, warbling Welcome to the op'ning Day: Below, with humbler Melody, Hopping from Bush to Bush, from Tree to Tree, A Thousand Birds in mirthful Concert play. Slow from the Plain, the melting Dew, To kiss the Sunbeams, climbing, rose; And bore sweet Odours, upward, as it flew, To guide their balmy Influence from the Foes. Still, some fresh Zephyr fann'd the fragrant Vale; And still a Thousand mingled Sweets rose with the spicy Gale. Along the Mountain's steep, but blooming Side, The creeping Vine, and scentful Myrtle spread: O'er the Rock's Margin, high, with frightful Pride, The over-hanging Palm the Winds defy'd: And rais'd, in dang'rous State, its branchy Head. At the Hill's Foot, with hoarse, and murm'ring Sound, A winding Riv'let roll'd its pebbly Way, And, ling'ring thro' th'enamell'd Vale, delighting there to stray, Late it's loud Passage into Jordan found. Far, on either Side the Brook, A rip'ning Harvest bent her golden Head; Bow'd, to invite th'expected Reaping-hook: And waving wanton, o'er its airy Bed, Sadly, at Distance, pleas'd their Sight, whose Taste it should have fed. X. All this fair Prospect, with commanding Eye, The thought-afflicted Gideon saw, from high: Happy enough, had this been all his View! But oh! he saw the Camp of Midian, too! Proudly spread, in warlike Awe, Death's whole collected Pomp, at once, he saw. A mingled Horror glitter'd from below: Tents, green, white, sanguine, azure, distant seen, Varied the Landschape, with a threat'ning Show: Whence gleamy Swords, and Lances, glow'd between; And fill'd, with terrible Delight, the sight-alarming Scene. Here, and there, high-mettled Steeds Bound loose, in wanton Exercise, and neigh along the Meads, In other Parts, the scyth-arm'd Chariots, driven, Wheel, round each other, with elusive Skill, Formful of future Schemes to kill: Swift, ev'ry Way, they wind, at Signals given; And open wide, and close again, at Will: Their brazen Wheels with Din the Valley fill; And shoot their clatt'ring Echoes up the Hill: Then, all at once, with yet more thund'ring Noise, The tortur'd Drums, and sprightly Trumpets, join'd, Proudly proclaim the waking Conqu'ror's Joys; And swell their savage Triumph up the Wind. XI. Light, from his Bench, enrag'd, young Gideon leapt, By Doubt, and Shame, and Grief, and Anger, press'd: God, who till now, he cry'd, his Promise kept, Leaves us abandon'd most, when most distress'd! Why, thou immortal Leader of our Race, Why were thy Blessings heap'd upon this Land? The Milk and Honey of thy promis'd Grace Flow'd ev'ry-where, throughout each charmful Space; But, oh! they flow'd to our Destroyer's Hand. And must it be? and can no Help be found? Said I, no Help?—Dishonest Sound! There can, there must, there shall.—This galling Yoke, Which haughty Midian will not ease, May—when God and Israel please, From off our Necks, at one determin'd Stroke, Be shook, in Fury; or, by Strength, be broke. But who, alas! what Hand shall guide the Blow? Heartless, our Tribes indulge their patient Woe; Half, with Treach'ry, aid the Foe: And, false to Heaven and Us, th'Invader own: The other Half, who hold their Country dear, Doubting God's Help, because 'tis slowly shown, Wish well for Conscience, and submit for Fear. Now were some single Power a general Bliss: What wanted Israel, when possess'd of This? The Kings about us, with uncurb'd Command, Timely directing, save their Land: We too, once prosper'd in a Monarch's Hand. Now, misaspiring to be loosely great, Disjunctive Freedom but enslaves our State. In Governments, where All would rule,—and None, by Choice, obey, Not soon, indeed, the self-disturbing Storm Yields to subside beneath a Tyrant Sway: But Power, so parcell'd, melts, in Broils, away; And noisy Contest, weak'ning Awe, must gen'ral Strength betray. Is there a Man throughout all Israel's Names, Who dares not, Hand to Hand, assault a Foe? Singly, All are free, and brave; Together, but one Coward, and one Slave! Since, all-excentric, each the rest disclaims, Why look we wide, th'apparent Cause to know? We, to defective Rule, our Mis'ries owe. Led by a Lion, Sheep, like Lions, dare: And Lions, led by Sheep, like Sheep, despair. He spoke; and with a swift, and manly Stride, Approach'd the Mountain's steepy Side: Sternly, on Midian, downward bent his Eyes, Glow'd, as he gazing felt new Passions rise: And roll'd 'em sparkling, to th'upbraided Skies. High beat his warm, and wish-disorder'd Heart, And his hot Bosom tingled with the Smart. XII. While thus in busy Silence, fix'd, he gaz'd, Th'unfolding Heav'ns with streamy Brightness blaz'd. Panting, his tongueless Terror would have spoke— But, as he view'd th'effulgent Chasm, amaz'd, Close, at his Ear, a bursting Thunder broke: And a Voice reach'd him, from th'abandon'd Oak. He turn'd, and in his late-left Station saw, Calmly reclin'd, a Youth divinely fair, Sitting, like some familiar Friend, some Partner of his Care. Pensive, he lean'd his Head on his Left-hand, His smiling Eye shed Sweetness, mix'd with Awe: His Right-hand, with a milk-white Wand, some Figure seem'd to draw. A nameless Grace was scatter'd thro' his Air: And, o'er his Shoulders, loosely flow'd his amber-colour'd Hair. As Gideon, wond'ring, tow'rd the Stranger drew, Th'immortal Visitor approach'd Him, too. Hail, happy Youth, he cry'd!—God's Chosen, hail! Thou Light of Israel! her commission'd Guide! Soon shall thy Sword o'er yon gay Power prevail: Hope boldly.—God will war on Gideon's Side. XIII. Whoe'er thou art, the Hero, sad, reply'd, Who know'st so well th'unhappy Gideon's Name; Would thou couldst tell, since God is on my Side, How comes it, he permits my Country's Shame? Where is the saving Rod of Moses, now? Where the lost Force of Joshua's warlike Hand? Where the flash'd Flame from night-hid Sinai's Brow? Oh! for that foe-preventing Cloud, by Day! Or, by Night, that fiery Ray, Which led our Fathers to this happy Land! What need of all this Waste of Wonders done, If, here, scarce seated, we must fall at last? Why, out of Pharaoh's Grasp was Israel won? Why the Red Sea, miraculously, past? Sure! since our Lot's for Ruin cast, More nobly wretched 'twould appear, To be, in Egypt, Slaves, than here! Why, now forsaking, was he pleas'd to chuse? Why call us His, at first? Never to have been blest, were lightlier curst. Hopes, from false Prospect, cruelly amuse: Better ne'er know a Bliss, than, known, to lose! As for myself, fain would I credit All: Long have I dar'd revolve proud Midian's Fall. But, void of Means to suit th'ambitious Aim, The Curb of Fortune keeps my Courage tame. Of all our Tribe, the poorest Race is mine; And of that poorest Race, the meanest I: Be it suppos'd I should incline War's dreadful Weight to try; Where is my Pow'r, my Interest, my Fame? Will Israel's haughty Tribes be led, by one without a Name? XIV. The Angel interrupting here, thus awfully reply'd, Israel, bold Hebrew, has her God defy'd. Since from affronted Heav'n th'ungrateful Race Hope lost Assistance, and would still prevail, Why have they broke God's Laws, renounc'd his Grace, And poorly bow'd to Ashtaroth, and Baal? Were These the Gods, who from th'Egyptian Land, Freed your lost Fathers, with unhop'd Success? 'Twixt wave-built Walls conducted 'em, to Idumæa's Strand? Safe steer'd you thro' the pathless Wilderness, Gave awful Pow'r to the Mosaic Wand, All proud Attempts from hostile Earth to check, And govern Heav'n, by its commission'd Beck? With liquid Rock to stream a springless Land, Call manna'd Harvests from th'unfruitful Sand, And save, and bless you, with a mighty Hand? Since, stubborn, for an empty Idol's sake, Your Articles with Heav'n you dar'd to break, What vain Presumption bids you judge it fit, Who slight the Bond, should reap the Benefit? But thou would'st say, Repentance dawns, at last; That, sadly conscious of their Error past; Groaning, in Anguish of their Souls, their Eyes to Heav'n they cast. How small th'Atonement, and how great the Sin! Yet, it suffices, that they, late, begin To quit th'ungrateful Paths, they've wander'd in: Unutterably gracious, God disdains To feel a Pleasure, in his Creatures Pains. Men, who slight Heav'n, but their own Bliss forsake: I, the Great Pard'ner's Minister, am sent, To arm Thee, Gideon, for thy brave Intent. Boldly resolve; and safely undertake. Hail, Heav'n's illustrious Instrument! Thine be the Ends, on which thy Thoughts were bent. XV. Gideon sigh'd sad, and graceful bow'd his Head; Heedful, to question, ere he yet believ'd So strange a Message, tho' from Heaven receiv'd. The deep-discerning Nuncio plainly read Each Scruple, in his arguing Fancy bred: Let me, said he, from yon forsaken Seat, Share that small Store, thy Grief neglects to eat. Gideon, with joyful Diligence obey'd, And humbly, at his Feet, the Napkin spread; And, in neat Order, hospitably laid His little Treat of Wine, and Flesh, and Bread: Yet, doubtful, and amaz'd, at what he did, My Lord, said he, who Heav'n's high Will reveals, Stoops not, I fear, to taste of mortal Meals: The Food of Angels is not Flesh of Kid. XVI. Be taught, reply'd th'unbody'd Guest, from this Consent, to know, Men, to Heav'n's Myst'ries, Faith implicit, owe. Let the Command suffice, nor Reason's Eye, With dang'rous Keenness, seek the darken'd Why. Where God has said, I'll have it so, All curious Inquisition must be spar'd: And nothing sought, beyond what stands declar'd. Be not, in human Ignorance, too scrupulously wise: But mindful, that obedient Faith is Man's best Sacrifice. He said: and, gently stretching out his Hand, Touch'd the spread Napkin with his snowy Wand. As, from hot Furnaces, the vap'ry Stream Mounts thick, and widens its evolving Steam, So, when the Angel his Reproof had spoke, At the watch'd Summons of the Wand's soft Stroke, A springy Flame from the dry Surface broke, And cover'd, and consum'd, th'untasted Store. Lovely the Fire rose whirling, mix'd with Smoke, Folding, in glorious Volumes, o'er and o'er: And upward, on a curling Cloud, the mounted Angel bore. Gideon look'd after him, and would have spoke; While, ravish'd with the fierce Delight, he saw him gently soar: Till forc'd to give the th'outlength'ning Prospect o'er, His Eyes, in wat'ry Brightness wept, for Bliss, they found no more. XVII. Musing a while, and dumb with deep Suspense, Thus loud, at last, his Wonder broke its Way. Immortal God! whose Glory's high Defence Thy own Almighty Hand can best display; Thy Hand, beneath whose angry Touch, whole Worlds would melt away! Can it be possible! to one, like me! Without Desert, of no Degree, It should be left, to draw the Sword for Thee! But dark, and wond'rous, ever, were thy Ways: All different Means grow equal in thy Hand; And all Things possible, where Man obeys His Maker's high Command. Why weigh I, thus, Decrees, I must fulfil? 'Twas holy Flame, I find, that did inspire My Soul's ungovernable Fire; And That was working Providence, which seem'd but wild Desire. Hence, then, with Apprehensions, and Delays; Hence, with all doubted Want of human Skill. God, if he meant me for his Praise, Will mould me to his Will. XVIII. While he yet spoke, from Ophra's neighb'ring Walls, A winding Horn, in short and sudden Calls, Invades his Ear, with high, and hoarse Alarms: And, from the Town, a mingled Tumult swarms Of every Rank, all Ages, weak, and strong: Flowing, in Tides of Uproar, thick along: Confus'dly arm'd, and more confus'dly led, They seem'd, with eager Threat'nings, to pursue A Party, which, along the Mountain's Side, In more Disorder fled. Gideon, in Haste, to his near House withdrew: There, with a Spear, his warlike Hand supply'd; And join'd th'egressive Croud, and follow'd, too. XIX. This was a Party, that, from Midian's Camp, Had, in the cov'ring Dusk of Night, been sent, To climb the Mountain, silent, and unspy'd, And, close conceal'd till Dawn, with dire Intent, 'Twixt the Cragg's bushy Clefts their Cohort hide: Till, at the op'ning Portal, rushing in, Surprize might force, what Siege, would, slowly, win. But Joash, early rising, every Day, Took Pleasure to behold the Morning break; To watch the first faint Shoots of Twilight play: And Night's dissolving Shades melt soft away. He, while his fragrant Walk he meant to take, Round the known Borders of his well-till'd Farm, Undreaming Danger, as unmeaning Harm, Down the Hill's Brow discern'd the Points of Spears, Suspiciously in sloping Covert bent; And saw the sheltry Bushes shake, along the green Descent. His taught Experience catch'd prophetic Fears: Swift to the Town convey'd this strong Alarm; And rous'd th'unwary Multitude, to arm. XX. Prevented, the discover'd Ambush rose, And fast retreated down the craggy Hill: Gideon, whose Breast pre-destin'd Honours fill, Doubly inspir'd, in Presence of his Foes, Wing'd his swift Feet with Heav'n's remember'd Will; And, now nigh-reaching, gain'd upon 'em, still. Oreb, a Midian Prince, of warlike Fame, Who led this Party on their close Design, Saw their Retreat, with mingled Rage, and Shame, And labour'd, earnestly, and long, to stop their headlong Flight: But neither Prayers, nor Blows, could now incline His scatt'ring Files, to bear the Hebrew's Sight. Mov'd therefore by a brave and princely Mind, He let the rushing Numbers pass him by; Then, following, march'd securely slow, behind: Oft facing, with a fierce, and flameful Eye; Himself an Army, while his People fly! He, when he found his Rear too closely prest, Turn'd sudden, in a steep, and winding Way, Where scarce two meeting Friends could pass, abreast, Such threddy Concave, here, deep-narrowing lay: And jutting Rocks, and frightful Steeps, hung horrid o'er the rest. Since, like a tim'rous Herd, said he, yon Cowards haste away, Nor blush, in Arms, their Sov'reign to betray, Let 'em enjoy their Safety, as they may; 'Tis now their Shame, who dare their Charge reject; 'Twere mine, should I the Negligent neglect: 'Tis a King's glorious Business, to protect. XXI. He said, and o'er an Angle of the Path, Observ'd a tott'ring Cliff, which loosely hung, Broke by long-drenching Rains, and wint'ry Wrath, Acutely pendent, 'twixt two Rock's rais'd Ends, Pond'rous it seems to arch the Road, and a roof'd Shadow lends. High, to one pointed Prop, the Prince ascends; Long, to the vast unweildy Weight, with struggling Labour clung: And down, at last, across the Path, the loady Barrier flung. Gideon, who just approach'd it, as it fell, Strides back, amaz'd, and scarce believes his Sight: Whoe'er thou art, he cry'd, thou tim'st it well: And sure! to do thy envy'd Courage Right, He, who so bravely flies, would nobly fight. XXII. Scarce had he spoke, when with a threat'ning Spear, Down, on the bulwark Rock, Prince Oreb leapt. Hebrew, he cry'd, thou art not safe, so near: Retire: This Pass will be too strongly kept. Speaking, aloft he shook his death-arm'd Lance, And to the shouting Thousands turn'd his Shield: The slow-descending Foes, now, scarce advance; But, from th'o'ercrowded Steep, in spiral Line, Aw'd, and astonish'd, at the fierce Design, Stand gazing at the Wonder, they beheld. Dreadfully bright, his gilded Armour shone; O'er his left Thigh, a crooked Sword declin'd: A feath'ry Plume high from his Helmet rose, And, loosely gay, wav'd warlike, in the Wind: Crimson, with Sable mix'd, half-shaded, flows, Severely charming, to his distant Foes! Of all the Press, Gideon alone comes on: The rest, in safe Defiance, threat, behind; Ignobly hurl their Jav'lins down in vain, Which, clatt'ring on his Shield, rebound, and tremble, back, again. XXIII. Gideon, awhile, revolv'd th'unequal War, And blush'd to see it basely wag'd from far: Then, rais'd his Arm, in Sign, that He, alone, Would make the gen'ral Hazard, all, his own. Hush'd was the Storm: and Oreb, smiling, saw One threat'ning Hebrew near him draw. Yet, cautious, to prevent too bold Advance, Aimful he poiz'd, and hurl'd, his beamy Lance: Timely th'Approacher bow'd his watchful Head, And harmless let the pointed Tempest fly; But his reach'd Station felt th'Invader nigh: Deep, in the cliffy Path, it Entrance found, And, echoing its Design, with thundring Sound, Jarr'd upward, as it stood erect, and quiver'd in the Ground. Gideon sprung near, and from beneath the Rock, Rising, at Hand, directs a speary Blow: The ringing Target yielded to the Shock, And the broad-ent'ring Steel broke thund'ring through. Half his bright Sword, the dreadful Oreb drew: When Fortune—blind Invertress of Event! Thus check'd th'impatient Speed his Ardour lent; Gideon strongly, from below, Dragg'd hard, to disengage th'intangled Spear, Which, while Prince Oreb's Shield retentive bound, Lightly th'Assaulter, leaping from the Ground, Help'd by the Staff's Resistance, firmly grasp'd, Reach'd the gain'd Rock, surpriz'd the Foe, and his arm'd Body clasp'd. To Heav'n a thund'ring Shout the Hebrews rais'd, Struck, and astonish'd! and transported, gaz'd. Far flies th'incumber'd Shield, wide hurl'd away; Lab'ring, each strives the other's Weight to lift: Now, curvy Grapplings every Bend, assay. Now, with a springy Force, in Starts of Rage, From sinewy Curb, their Joints they disengage: Soon clos'd again, with stormy Grasp they meet, Arms fett'ring Arms, and Feet perplexing Feet: Elusive long, with new, and wily Drifts, From Side to Side, th'evasive Whirlwind shifts; They heave, they drag, they twist, bend, lift, and strain: And tire each practis'd Nerve, yet toil in vain. Fiercely, at length, provok'd, at Art's Delay, Born for plain Conquest, and the Glare of Day! Strength's utmost Effort, in one Proof, to make, With Feet firm fix'd, and stretch'd-out Arms, the Rock's loose Clefts they shake. Sudden, they feel their Prop's false Fabric break: Time-worn, the flaky Pediment's press'd Slate, Splitting beneath the human Tempest's Weight, Roll'd one huge Fragment down, while one vast Flake, Backward reclining, now scarce choak'd the Streight: Distant, compell'd, th'unclosing Warriors fall, And the freed Path unbars her Track, to All. XXIV. Gideon, awhile, long stunn'd, above:—Oreb, who downward fell, Roll'd Sev'n steep Paces, ere his Feet he gain'd: But, swift recov'ring, with indignant Swell, Look'd back, and saw, surpriz'd, that this dire Chance, Bursting the Pass, he had so long maintain'd, Had left it open to his Foes Advance. Then, hopeful, hard Pursuit would now prove vain, Should the Persisters press his flying Train; Swift, as a Tyger bounds, he leaps away, Light, and regardless, where best Passage lay: Till near behind him came th'o'ertaking Shout. Then, paus'd he, calm, look'd heedfully about: Mark'd in the Mountain's Side, a dusky Cave; And enters there, with slow Suspense, his future Hope to save. XXV. As rapid Currents, choak'd by float-mix'd Mud, Check'd for a Moment, smooth their troubled Flood; Then, sluicing on, to clear th'obstructed Way, With tenfold Force renew their sweepy Sway: So when the Hebrews saw the Passage free, In headlong Cat'ract, down the Steep they gush'd; And, in rude Flow, fast by the Cavern rush'd. Nor dreamt, that Oreb could so near 'em be. To the Hill's outmost Verge, at last, they came, Where a broad Terras, form'd by Nature, spread, And, round the Mountain, rear'd a pensile Plain. Hither, by vain Pursuit, the Hebrews, led, Beheld th'escaping Foe the Valley gain, And safely, there, in rallying Line, make Head. Thence, at more Distance, cross the forded Stream, Squadrons, from Midian's Camp detach'd, they view'd; Whose sun-struck Weapons flash'd a threat'ning Gleam. Then, Gideon found it prudent to retreat, And, timely wise, reclimb'd the steep Ascent; But, marching slowly, with attentive Feet, Examin'd ev'ry Cavern, as he went: From that, in which Prince Oreb lay, sudden an ent'ring File, With Eyes cast backward, trembling, outward flew: Close at their Heels came dreadful Oreb, too; By Nature, always eager to pursue! But, soon as Gideon he beheld, and knew, He sheath'd his Sword, and with a graceful Smile, Now first, said he, this Sword, in vain, I drew. But, forc'd to yield, 'tis best I yield to you. The gen'rous Hebrew, bowing mild, reply'd; Fortune not always favours the most brave: Had partial Vict'ry still sustain'd your Side, She would have robb'd me of wish'd Pow'r to save. And you had wrong'd a Hebrew Heart, untry'd. XXVI. While they were speaking, and the should'ring Croud, Morosely insolent, and rudely loud, Was climbing round, all gaping for a View, As if the Conquest claim'd the Insult, too! A second Chance diverts th'impatient Throng; For some, who newly search'd the Cavern, round, Noiseful return'd, and with 'em dragg'd along, Ten weeping Slaves, whom, there, conceal'd they found: Poor Fugitives of antient Canaan's Race, Once happy Owners of that promis'd Land, Where, forc'd to give th'invading Hebrews Place, They, now, liv'd subject to their harsh Command. Severely us'd, and tir'd with Length of Woe, The new-found Ten had from their Masters run: Drawn by the Nearness of the gen'ral Foe, To meditate Escape, and Slav'ry shun. They might, perhaps, with Midian join'd, be free; Worse than they were, they knew, they could not be: And there's a kind of mournful Ease, in Change of Misery. XXVII. When, to the Town, the noisy Press Return'd with Shouts, their Triumph to express; Shouts, the Voice of proud Success! Th'assembled Elders, o'er the City Gate, Sat, wisely busy'd, in serene Debate, On Questions, which concern'd the Good, of Ophra's little State. Sev'n was their Number; and they chose to sit In a bow'd Crescent's Form, whose Points were fill'd By Two of Levi's sacred Sons—best skill'd To judge of Laws in rev'rend Myst'ry writ: Sage, in the Centre, hoary Joash sat, Renown'd for Virtue, and rever'd for Age: Th'assisting Four were Men of Years and Skill, Fam'd, Themselves, for shunning Ill: And, therefore, thought best qualify'd, to govern Other's Will. To These, the Croud their Ten Deserters bring, And tell where found, and on what Errand bent: To These they also shew the captive King: But, loud, in ev'ry list'ning Ear, they Gideon's Praises ring. Paint how he dar'd; act o'er th'admir'd Event: And mock Prince Oreb's brave Resolve, to stop their fierce Descent. XXVIII. Slow rose Eliakim, the Town's High Priest; The ruling Levite, and the Senate's Tongue: A Man, who dar'd, in Zeal to Heav'n, bewail Religion lost, and Hebrew Fame decreas'd: He well remember'd, while he yet was young, How God enabled Israel to prevail: And sigh'd, to see th'ungrateful People fail, Nor ever bow'd the Knee, Himself, to Ashtaroth, or Baal. Bless'd be our Father's God, said he, this Day! To whom, All owing, we would nothing pay! Gideon! methinks, I feel thy Father's Joy. O! may thy blooming Glory never fade! No Envy, sure! will budding Virtue shade: Soon does thy Country's Love thy Sword employ! The Prince, Thy Captive, by the Right of War, Dispose of, at thy safe Discretion's Choice: And, since all Ophra's Sons thy Debtors are, Accept our Thanks, as from the gen'ral Voice. Dare on; fight: prosper! Heav'n shall bless thy Aim; This, but the Dawning of thy destin'd Fame! For You—and then he turn'd to Canaan's trembling Sons, Known Custom points us to your mournful Lot: Since ev'ry Slave, who from his Master runs, Dies—guilty of an added Crime, or not. He spoke: and, bending toward the bord'ring Seats, Ask'd, if their Judgment full Concurrence lent; And then, distinctly, his Decree repeats; And all the Elders rose, at once, to testify Consent. XXIX. Gideon, whose fearless Heart was form'd to feel, Sharer, in ev'ry Woe he could not heal! Sigh'd, pitying the poor Slave's prevented Flight: And, bowing graceful, spoke in Sorrow's Right. Who, rev'rend Fathers! after This, will pause, in Honour's Chace, The Prize so glorious, and so short the Race! Too much you pay me, for too little won. If, but to act our Duty claims such Praise, For what, alas! has Gideon, further, done? We live, I fear, in unperforming Days. But your too kind Applause, perhaps, would raise A future Worth, by previous Praise. If, wisely gen'rous, you incline To make that grateful Lesson mine. Consenting Will holds modest Purpose dumb: And humbly takes your present Thanks, for Actions, yet, to come. One Cause, mean while, not mine, I fain would plead; I cannot wish to see the Wretched bleed: Who knows, what Hardships, in their friendless State, Had gall'd their patient Hearts, ere yet they fled? But grant Them guilty—Law mistakes their Fate. Death, in the Happy, may create some Dread: But the cold Grave is Mis'ry's restful Bed. There are Oppressions, of such monstrous Weight, That 'twere the happiest Freedom, to be dead. Such, if their Wrongs, we lose our stern Intent; And give 'em Ease from Pain—for Punishment! Judge not, I pray you, that I mis-presume, Or pride myself to think, you Favours owe, If, loving Mercy, I deplore their Doom. Bring home an alien Danger, then, appeal: Make the Case yours: and sentence, as you feel. Israel Herself was, once, a Slave: Grant, Heav'n, if ever she, again, be so, She finds a Moses, or a God,—to save! If, then, our Fathers found it hard, the Yoke to undergo, And having, once, been unoppress'd, and free, Thought it their Glory, and their Right—to fly from Slavery; Instruct me, rev'rend Rulers! why These Men, Now, in the Case, that was all Israel's, then, Should merit Death, for counting, in their Claim, That noble Thirst of Liberty, that, first, gave Israel Fame. XXX. He paus'd:—Approving Joash smil'd with Pride, And heard, with kindred Joy, his Offspring blest. Eliakim, with weak, but willing Stride, And Hands uplifted (Sign of Zeal express'd!) Came forward, and to blushing Gideon, cry'd, Close let me press Thee to my hope-warm'd Breast. No narrow Bounds of Custom, Int'rest, Will, Shall e'er confine the Reach of Gideon's Soul. A Mind so spacious, and so stretch'd a Skill, Were, sure! design'd by Heav'n for wide Controul! O! take the pardon'd Slaves, thy Mercy's Prize: Thou plead'st too justly, to be heard in vain. Henceforth, their Fate, in thy own Bosom, lies; Bless'd in thy Service, the sav'd Ten retain: What, happier can they wish?—How, happier be? Thou gav'st 'em Life: and they shall live for Thee. XXXI. Th'Assembly rose: and the Remains of Day Were, in triumphant Pastime, nois'd away: At length, still Night her solemn Influence shed, And dew-drench'd Sable wrapt the Mountain's Head: Sleep's heavy Drag the Rage of Joy depress'd, And weary Tumult hush'd herself to Rest. But Gideon's active Mind was fram'd to wake: His new-gain'd Honour, and the Angel's Hail, Suffer'd Him no Rest to take: But led him, pensive, o'er the Grounds, thro' Night's opakest Veil. So, wand'ring wide, he reach'd the Grove of Baal. Westward, upon the Mountain's Edge, it stood, Where, shap'd by Art, a huge round Hill, in terrass'd Stages rose; Whose far-seen Pyramid, Five Plains compose: And ev'ry Stage was a small, sep'rate, Wood. The lowermost, planted thick, with baleful Eugh, Could, with brown Horror, quench the Glare of Noon: But now, from Night, a deeper Dusk it drew. The fun'ral Cypress the next Stage o'erspread; The Third, which, narrowing, upward, wanted Room For Trees of copious, and untonsile Head, From deep-ting'd Laurel caught umbrageous Gloom. Round the Fourth Platform, climbing Ivy crept, And into bushy Shade high-arching grew: There, in dark-tufted Roofs, black Ravens slept; And inbred Owls, which never Daylight knew. Flat, like a tabled Plain, the last high Stage Nourish'd one tow'ring Oak, which strongly stood, The time-swoln Growth of many a perish'd Age: And bore, on one proud Trunk, a spacious Wood. Down, o'er the shadow'd Groves, above, th'enormous Branches hung, And form'd a sheltry Arbour, round the Bole: Mov'd, by the Wind, with murm'ring Sweep they swung, And blew cool Horror over Gideon's Soul. From Stage to Stage, broad Steps, of half-hid Stone, With curling Moss, and blady Grass, o'ergrown, Led to the Top, where reign'd this Monarch Oak. 'Twixt the black Boughs, hung, melancholy, down, One glimm'ring Lamp, dull'd by its own thick Smoke: Which, feebly, thro' a Lantern's Sides, the bord'ring Darkness broke. XXXII. By the pale Radiance, faintly, scatter'd round, Full in the Centre of this awful Shade, Gideon, the Idol of the Grove survey'd. O'er a round Altar, by green Foliage bound, A wooden Sculpture bore the Sun's broad Face: Hideously kind, in Act of purpos'd Grace; Stretching thin Arms, across th'o'ershadow'd Space, It gleam'd an added Horror round the Place. Speechless, a while, 'twixt mingled Grief, and Shame, This Pageantry of Godhead he beheld: At length, revoic'd, by his remember'd Aim, How long, said he, shall Idol Faith prevail? How long, th'Eternal's Priests bow down to Baal? And Stones, and Blocks, usurp th'Almighty's Name? All-pard'ning Heav'n! I feel thy Wrongs inspire: Burn we this Dæmon, in his own dim Fire. Where can we better Virtue's Race begin, Than at th'eradicated Shoot of Sin? XXXIII. So saying, o'er the dusky Paths, he, back, explor'd his Way, And, silent, to an outbuilt Hovel came, Where, in safe Sleep, his new-gain'd Servants lay. They wake, and hear him, and mistake his Aim: Strain their stretch'd Eyes, and, trembling, ask his Name. Be hush'd, he answer'd, and dismiss your Fear, Only your Patron's Voice, you hear. Rise, and assist him, in a just Design; Or no way dang'rous, or the Danger mine. For You—This done, I set you free, Fear not to trust your late-given Lives with Me. Be grateful: 'twill adorn your Liberty. Uprush the summon'd Ten, with glad Consent, Nor weigh, nor question, his Intent: Enough for Them, that 'tis, by Gideon, meant. From a rough Store of rustic Instruments, Which next that Hovel, opportunely, lay, To ev'ry Hand a shining Axe he gave, Bad 'em be resolute, and brave: And, cautious, march'd, in silent Speed, away. In a fair Pasture, bord'ring on their Road, A milk-white Ox, in fragrant Plenty, graz'd: Unbroken yet, and alien to the Goad, Chief, of a chosen Breed by Joash rais'd. Him, first, they seize, and having bound him strong, Drag him, hard-struggling, and displeas'd, along. XXXIV. Instructively inform'd, as on they went, Hast'ning, and prompt, they reach th'unhallow'd Grove: There, to a Tree, th'unwilling Victim tie; Then, on the pious Mischief warmly bent, Each, with contending Emulation strove, Laborious, in Obedience, to outvye. First, Baal's polluted Altar down they threw, And scatter'd wide the Fragments, ev'ry Way: Next, from disjointed Steps, with Toil, they drew The massy Stones; which, in loose Pile, they lay, A purer Altar, of new Frame, to raise: Sacred to a diviner Pow'r, and more exalted Praise. Now, to the Idol Form, approaching nigh, Gideon his Sword, in zealous Transport, drew; Witness, he cry'd, sole God! who hear'st from high, Witness the Vengeance, from thy Servants due! Thou, Baal! assert thy Pow'r, and 'scape thy Shame: Strike, if thou can'st: I, thus, thy Cause disclaim. Speaking, he cleav'd the Image, at a Blow, On either Side, the parted Godhead fell: Winds, o'er the Grove, shrill-shrieking Echoes blow, And all the Dæmons of the Place, groan'd helpless from below. Encourag'd by their Lord, the shaking Train, To smaller Pieces, hew the chippy God: Atoning Fire the dreary Spoils maintain, And the dim Lamp no longer gleam'd in vain. Then, at th'attentive Leader's waited Nod, Up the Grove's Edge, the back'ning Ox they strain. XXXV. The mounting Fire, now, blaz'd in tow'ry Pride, When a fair Bowl, by Gideon's Hand, in previous Care, supply'd, Apt for Libation, Aid of Sacrifice, High-filling,—He, upon the hissing Flame, Pour'd the warm Blood, and prostrate bow'd, to pray; Not these imperfect Rites, said he, Lord of the Heart! despise: Call 'em Ablution, and let Israel's Shame Be, from this Time, for ever wash'd away! He said; when, strait, confirming Thunder roar'd, And cross whole Heav'n, with loud Enlargement, roll'd: Sudden, the dazzling Gates of Light unfold, And, while the kneeling Hero Grace implor'd, Show'rs of thin Lustre quiver'd thro' the Trees: The living Lights from ev'ry Quarter play; And the Grove radiates into flashing Day. A while the Blaze hung o'er; but, by Degrees, Rose gently: and, in Distance, flow'd away. Flat, the Slaves, astonish'd, fell, And, drown'd in the refulgent Torrent lay; With awe-mix'd Pleasure felt their Bosoms swell: And, as th'ascending Glow unseal'd their Eyes, Trembling, gaz'd after it, to see it rise, And, wid'ning upward, more and more, in soft'ning Shades decay. XXXVI. Recov'ring, each on other, wild they glare: Then, humbly, to their honour'd Patron, kneel: Words tho' they want their Meaning to declare, They more want Coldness to forbear: For Joys, by Transport, will themselves reveal. Phurah, best taught, of these devoted Men, At length, found Voice, for the collective Ten. Bless'd be the God of this brave Hebrew Race! Fall our false Gods before his dreadful Face! Never could Baal thus vindicate his Name; Thus speak, in Thunder, and appear in Flame! O, glorious Mortal, thus, by Heav'n approv'd! Leave us not wretched, to be blindly free; Since by the Great Almighty thus belov'd, 'Twere to be lost, to be disjoin'd from Thee: And to serve Gideon, and his God, is noblest Liberty. He said: and all his Fellows join'd his Pray'r, And begg'd, with pious Tears, permitted Stay: The gen'rous Hebrew found 'em worth his Care: If you will still be mine, said he, you may. Nor shall you suffer by the Lot, you chuse; Whom God invites, Man ought not to refuse. But let us, now, my new-made Friends, proceed, And finish well the Work, we well began. So speaking, round th'enormous Oak, he ran; And, by the Fire's pale Cast, yet glimm'ring wide, Saw, from that Quarter, which oppos'd the West, That, there, the Boughs o'erhung the Mountain's Side, Against whose Edge the grovy Summit prest. XXXVII. Once more, his broad well-temper'd Blade he drew, And gash'd, with all his Strength, the knotty Tree: Then, steely Axes following, Two by Two, Relieving apt, a long, alternate Toil, Lab'ring with fruitless Pain, they wond'ring see, From the tough Trunk's big Bulk, back-bounding Blows recoil. But, still persisting, with unweary'd Will, Wide, toward the Root, a yawning Wound they make; Whence scatt'ring Chips the bord'ring Bushes fill. Then, late, the nodding Oak begins to groan; The leafy Limbs, in gen'ral Horror, shake: Bending, the Forest-Giant breaks, and is, at once, o'erthrown. Down rolls the tumbling Monster, o'er the Rocks, And sweeps the Grove before it, with its Sway: From Cliff to Cliff rebounds, with frightful Shocks, And gores the groaning Mountain, in its Way. Broad, o'er the Plain below, it loads the shadow'd Ground; And grazing Herds, with stiffen'd Ear, start, trembling, from the Sound. BOOK II. I. 'Twas Morning: and, o'er Ophra's Tow'rs, the Sun Rose lovely, with unusual Lustre bright: For, pleas'd to find the long-wish'd Task begun, His Fires glow'd sparkling, with intense Delight. But Gideon, well reflecting what was done, Restless had mus'd away the tedious Night; And from a Garden's silent Shade, look'd longing, for the Light. There Joash, risen from interrupted Rest, Found, and breath'd Blessings o'er, his pensive Son: And, now by Wonder, now by Fear, oppress'd Heard All distinctly; from the Angel's Hail, To the Grove's Ruin, and the Fall of Baal. II. Gideon, said He, Prop of my failing Years! If what thy Father's doubtful Love shall speak Should seem too coldly weigh'd, too kindly weak, Think, in Excuse of what may harsh appear, Youth is too full of Hope; and Age, of Fear. He paus'd, and turn'd: and dry'd a starting Tear. 'Tis great, continued He, this Thirst of Fame! Bright, tho' dang'rous, is the Flame, That warms thy manly Breast, with this extensive Aim. But, art thou not deceiv'd, by some fair Dream? Things strongly wish'd, Men oft believe they see: For vig'rous Fancy can so subtly seem, That Nonexistence may be thought to be. If 'twas, in Truth, an Angel, thou hast seen, Joash is happy, and his Country blest: Afflicted Israel, then, shall soon find Rest: But, if my Gideon has deluded been, Then, who from Mis'ry my sad House shall screen? Who, save Thy harmless Infants, from the Sword? Thy Soul-distracting Grief, alas! will no Relief afford: Thy Punishment include a People's Fate; And thy too bold and honest Heart, be undeceiv'd, too late. III. Rev'rend, and wise, reply'd th'attentive Chief, Your Doubt of Me, by past Experience mov'd, Admits, obscure, and slowly, the Belief, That I am heav'n-approv'd. Yet; coldest Caution safely may confess, Weakness, where God supports, can strongly bless. Nor blush, unlikely as it is, the glorious Hope to own: Occasion, oft, has latent Virtue, shown, Where Kindred's too close Sight distinguish'd none. Call'd by th'Almighty's leading Voice, I go, Fearless, amidst yon Camp, on Jezreel's Plain. Fain would I thence remove th'incumbent Foe: Their neighb'ring Weight does my warm Wish restrain. To Arms, till then, 'twere dang'rous to repair, Lest our aw'd Tribes, th'Oppressor view'd too nigh, Shrink from assum'd Resolve; disperse, and fly. You, venerable Sire! mean while, prepare Th'assembled Senate, for th'important Hope; Tell 'em, God's Promise lends Contraction Scope; The Fall of Baal, with its great Cause, declare: And charm 'em with th'inspiring News, of Heav'n's recover'd Care. IV. Speaking, he bow'd; and, turning swift away, Left the sad Father's Answer, half unmade. Joash broke short what Prudence meant to say: Silent look'd after him; his Words, long weigh'd; Then, stretch'd to Heav'n his aged Arms, and begs the doubted Aid. —On the North Range of Ophra's rugged Wall, Rose a round Tow'r, of white and massy Stone: Seen, from whose Summit's far-commanding View, High-posted Archers Bows unerring, drew; Thence, o'er steep Windings, aw'd the Road below, Check'd the rash Hope of an advent'rous Foe: Stopp'd Passengers, and left th'Ascent to None, Till Who they were, and whence they came, was shewn. Deep, in the vaulted Base, Life's languid Tomb! A still, damp, Dungeon lodg'd eternal Gloom. Its iron Door, which rust-worn Hinges hung, Harsh grating, through the stony Portal, swung. Echo's hard Groan threw sad Sensation round, And thought-bound Silence started, at the Sound! Painful Regard strain'd sharp her visual Ray, To catch faint Embryos, of excluded Day; Where, through thick Walls, oblique, thin Ghosts of Light, Gleam'd from pale Loop-holes, quiver'd to the Sight. V. Here, well secur'd, the State her Pris'ners, kept: And here, this Night, confin'd, Prince Oreb slept. Yet, no vile Chain insulted his Restraint; Well treated, by his gen'rous Guardian's Care; Who, from Captivity, to chase Complaint, Shut out no Freedom, but of Light, and Air. Here, with swift and furious Stride, Close-folded Arms, and short and sudden Starts, The fretful Prince, in dumb and sullen Pride, Revolv'd Escape, and curs'd, in Pain, his People's coward Hearts. VI. So Gideon finds him: and, with gentle Grace, Accosts him thus—Great Prince! your scopeful Will Suffers Restraint, I see, but ill. Those Feet, long us'd your Enemies to chase, Spurn at Detention; and were nerv'd for Space. Tho' manly Suff'rers loud Complaint restrain, Impatient Silence paints internal Pain. But, Smiles are Wisdom, where Regret is vain. Great Minds, in Want of present Ease, Should teach some future Hope to please. Such if your Prospect, I would aid its Claim. Take, Sir, your Sword: and, from this Moment, free, Re-fire your Camp, to War's recover'd Flame: Go, ransomeless.—No Grace deserves Regard, That stoops to barter Virtue, for Reward. My noblest Gain, let This due Glory be, That He, whose erring Arms oppress'd the Free, Ow'd His own forfeit Liberty, to me. VII. The silent Prince, whom this new Chance alarms, Stood fix'd, awhile, with an astonish'd Air: Then, swift advancing, snatch'd him to his Arms. O Baal! he cry'd, How much, in War, they dare! Yet, after Victory, how mild, they are! Why am I hostile, to such manly Charms? More he had said, but Gideon, whose warm Mind Flash'd its first Greatness o'er his Captive's Soul, And schem'd a length'ning Lustre, yet behind; Thus interrupted, ere he spoke the Whole. Nations ill taught make War a barb'rous Trade: But Men who fight for Liberty, and Peace, When their Arms prosper, by th'Almighty's Aid, Feel their Revenge impow'r'd: and bid it cease. Near is your Camp. Yet, lest th'impeded Way Prove dang'rous, while this Mountain you descend, Myself, your Safeguard, will your Steps attend. Charg'd with Alliance, offer'd to your State, Let your met Kings, th'auxiliar Purpose weigh, Hold us Confed'rate, and retract their Hate. Pledge me your Royal Faith, lest slight Pretence Bids Force detain me: or, returning, thence, Some ambush'd Wrong provokes unwish'd Offence. —By the high thund'ring Baal! the Prince reply'd, By blood-stain'd Moloch!—pale Astarte's Beam! Hot Belial! and whole Heav'n's collective Host! Gods, Male and Female, who yon Realms divide! Those, whom We worship! Him, of whom You dream! And whose joint Aid is warlike Midian's Boast: All, who shall dare Thy Wrong, My Sword defies. Thou shalt be safe: or Oreb, with thee, dies. VIII. He spoke: and stooping through a Postern Gate, Which, from the Tow'r, led, winding, down the Hill, Gideon, descending, with eductive Skill, Steers his Companion, 'twixt the mazy Rocks, And the deep Cleavings of the Hill unlocks. Dark'ning and cool, beneath th'incumbent Shade Of goat-browz'd Bushes; which, in Sylvan State, Bow'd, by their own declining Weight, Hung deep'ning o'er the ragged Cliffs, and in the Breezes play'd; A short, unpeopled, Path, their Feet explore; High from whose shelvy Steeps far round, hoarse-tumbling Torrents roar. Down, cross the craggy Lab'rinth, safely slow, From Rock to Rock they slide; from Shade to Shade; Each lending Other, heedful Aid: Till, from the Glooms of their untrodden Way, As Men, from Night, wake sudden, into Day, They saw the silver Stream, at Distance, flow: And flash'd upon the op'ning Plain, below. IX. Now, on the Valley's Edge, th'egressive Pair Outstarting, spy'd, from far, a dusty Cloud, Which wid'ning circled tow'rd 'em, in the Air; And half conceal'd a wild and noisy Crowd, Through which, the Ring of brazen Wheels, was heard distinct and loud. When to the River, unobserv'd, they came, They found the Charioteers of Oreb, there: Wat'ring their wanton Steeds, with heedless Aim. Wide-dispers'd, and loose, they were: Thoughtless of Danger, All, and void of Care. The Prince beheld 'em, with indignant Shame: His Pride felt Anguish, and his Eyes shot Flame. Unwary Slaves! he cry'd—Is This the Way? Retrieve Ye, thus, the Fame so lately lost? My Coward Foot, in Arms, their Prince, betray: My Horse, untaught by their Companion's Cost, Regardless Negligence, un-arm'd, display: And long to be as infamous, as They! Why met I not your Outguards, posted here? What, on this Quarter, thus expos'd, our neighb'ring Camp, defends? Since, for me, the Road was clear, What, if the Foe lay ambush'd, near? Wretches! is yon strong Mountain held, by Friends? His People heard him, with a glad Surprize: Mix'd, in their Breasts, the vary'd Passions rise: But Joy, triumphant, stifling Sense of Shame, A Storm of Shouts rose ceaseless, to the Skies: Echoing, the bord'ring Hills th'Alarm proclaim, And the wide Valley rings, with Oreb's Name. X. High, on an open Chariot's airy Seat, In State, the Prince and Gideon onward ride: Re-closing swift, th'outstarted Squadrons meet, And flow behind 'em, like a following Tide. Pour'd from the Camp, the mingled Nations roar, Sweeping, tumultuous, o'er the dusty Plain: Loose Horse and Foot, in stretch'd Extent, still length'ning more and more, In endless Chain of Triumph, swell the Train. But, when Both Swarms met mix'd, upon the Green, And Oreb's high-rais'd Chariot shone, between: Should'ring, the clam'rous Concourse gather'd round, And clogg'd his Progress, and o'erwedg'd his Ground: Slow mov'd th'incumber'd Pomp, through deaf'ning Noise; And the Prince labour'd, with the People's Joys. So, when, within some Island's sea-wash'd Streight, A Bark, with full-blown Canvas, holds her Course, Two billowy Currents urge encount'ring Weight; And, swell'd to Uproar by cross Clash of Tides; Roll murm'ring on; and, climbing wild and hoarse, Work o'er Each Other, with contending Force: Heav'd through ascending Foam, the way-stop'd Vessel rides, And scarce, with All her bellying Sails, th'encircling Roar, divides. XI. Safe, to th'expecting Camp, at last, they come, Where, waiting, All th'assembled Chiefs, they found; There, did Joy's liveliest Ecstasies abound: And false Congratulation, too, bow'd formal, to the Ground. From Ev'ry Side at once, the thund'ring Drum Beat his hoarse Welcome; while, in shriller Sound, The Trumpet's soft and trembling Note flow'd undulating round. White, on a smooth and gently rising Hill Full in the Centre of the Camp, was pitch'd One crown'd Pavilion, of unmatch'd Extent; Lin'd with an azure Field of Silk, by crimson Groves enrich'd: Whence gold and purple Fruits, in Clusters bent, Fed the charm'd Eye, with feastful Ornament. Three Walls, of circly green, th'imperial Tent, Guarded at equal Distances, invest: Wide, round th'exterior Third, lay, far outspread, Smooth Void, whose silent Range admits no vulgar Tread: For, there, th'associate Monarch's Feet the hallow'd Surface press'd. XII. Hither, to Council, while they bent their Way, In his right Hand, Prince Oreb, Gideon, led: The graceful Hebrew march'd at Ease, and gay; And from his Eyes a radiant Sweetness, shed. Circled by Kings, and taller, by the Head, His native Majesty eclips'd their Pride: A Leopard's Skin, the Paws, together, ty'd, Dreadfully gay, was o'er his Shoulder, spread: And, to the Right, slop'd pendent, from his Side. A rich wide-skirted Crimson Vest O'er-wrap'd, with conscious Glow, his manly Breast: Girt by a purple, silver-studded Belt; In which his fated Sword at Freedom hung. While, at each Step, his Arm, was gently swung, The low-poiz'd Spear, majestic, seem'd to nod: And sway'd, with threat'ning Grandeur, as he trod. Cool, o'er his fair and bloom-enliven'd Face, A jet-black Plume wav'd slow, with shadowy Grace. XIII. Now, round the enter'd Umbrage, marching slow, The Royal Brotherhood their Places, fill. Encircling Legions edge the Plain below: O'er whose close Heads unfurling Ensigns flow; And, from th'important Space to ward off Ill, A steely Grove of glitt'ring Spears rise round the dreadful Hill. From the Tent-door, a Chief his Jav'lin shook, And thrice distinctly sounded on his Shield: The watchful Guards the well-known Signal took, And rung it downward, through the war-dress'd Field. Silenc'd, the distant Soldiers sit, and wait Th'Event of All their Sov'reign's joint Debate. Gradual, the floating Roar of War subsides, And sinking Clamour draws back All her Tides. Soft, the sweet Trumpet's Echoes die away; And the yet murm'ring Drum, unwilling sleeps: Through the still Air, thin-body'd Whispers play; And voiceless, o'er the awe-hush'd Camp, profound Attention creeps. XIV. Then Oreb, glowing gen'rous, thus began: Brothers in War! Kings, of confed'rate Sway! Lend Action Ev'ry grateful Pow'r you can: Words are too weak, to thank this godlike Man. If, to behold me here, alive, To-day, Aids your Arm's Prospect, and you wish to know, From what kind Source, my future Hope must flow, 'Twill sound surprising, in your Royal Ear, That when, unman'd by a repulsive Fear, Despairing Friends abandon'd Fame, and Me; This wond'rous Foe, this Hebrew, whom you see, Conquer'd, to save; and set me free! Then, touch'd with Warmth, but to the Gen'rous known, He told his People's Flight: told, how, Alone, He stop'd the Hebrews, with the Giant Stone. Told, how he fought, escap'd; and, from the Cave, Pursuing Others, lost Himself, again: Told, how his Conqueror, serenely brave, Ransomless, his Freedom, gave. And, shall, said He, this glorious Act, but, empty Praise, obtain? No.—Tho' th'unvenal Benefactor's Mind Flow'd out on Virtue, ev'n for Virtue's Sake, They, whom such stainless Obligations bind, Should doubly weigh the Worth, of All they take: And, where they find the Debt without Allay, With tenfold Gratitude, make Haste to pay. He paus'd:—and, with a loud, concurrent, Praise, Spread, on the Breast, his Hand, Each Monarch lays: Jointly oblig'd, Each sep'rate, Vows Regard; And bids the Stranger name his wish'd Reward. XV. Gideon smil'd satisfy'd: and, bowing low, Reply'd—Great Kings! you Nothing owe. Light were His Virtue, and of narrow Scope, Who weigh'd his Sense of Duty, by his Hope. Much you o'er-rate a Mark of due Respect: Bless'd, as I was, to snatch th'important Care, A Prince, of Midian, to protect! Esteem it but an Instance of That Pride, With which our Tribes remember, who you are. Nor think me vain, th'Occasion, so, supply'd, If I remind you, we are near ally'd. —Midian, the mighty Founder of your Name, Was, ev'n as Isaac was, our Abr'am's Son. Both had an equal Start, and Spur, to Fame: Both, in one Father's Blessing, equal Claim: Tho', (thence our Grief!) in diff'rent Paths, to run. O, Power, of Custom! Law, Religion! Place! Little, alas! our common Parent thought, His time-chang'd Sons, unmindful of their Race, In diff'rent Lands, a diff'rent Int'rest taught, With hostile Rancour, should Each Other chase; And War, fraternal Glory to efface! But, Heav'n be thank'd. It was not, always, so.— When from proud Egypt's hard Oppression, led, When, deep through desart Wastes, compell'd to go, Kind Midian taught our cherish'd Feet to tread: Even to these Plains where Midian now, encamps, our fiercest Foe, We were, by Midian, led. When hospitable Jethro'—Hail,great Name! You know it, mighty Princes!—for, you claim Deriv'd Succession, both in Blood and Fame; When He, kind Guide! left Country, Power, and Ease, Our March's Guardian, through its hard Degrees! Even to This Canaan, whence, (oh, Force, of Years!) You strive to root us out, in Blood, and Tears: He knew, that Midian's Sons, with Israel's join'd, Were Brothers, parted long, and re-combin'd. Doubtless, his Wisdom had found good, to weigh, That Countries, given to Abr'am's general Race, Might not alone be soonest won, By Deeds of War conjointly done; But, that, so conquer'd, such Extent of Space Might stretch joint Blessing, for our mix'd Embrace. Israel, he knew, no sep'rate Claim, could lay, Since Midian's Race had Abr'am's Right, as notedly as They. Why are we Foes then?—Arm'd, on Midian's Side, Lead us to Realms, whose Wealth we might divide. As yet, the poorest Part of Canaan's ours: Her western Coast defies even Midian's Powers. Wide, from Gaza, Northward, spread, Lie Countries we regard with Dread. Who has not heard of Sidon's boastful State? And the proud Opulence of tradeful Tyre? We, barrenly confin'd to inland Rocks, Unhappily are warr'd on, by our Friends: They, unexpos'd to hostile Shocks, Bribing Indemnity, when Pride offends, On foodful Pastures shear unnumber'd Flocks: And, safe, in all the Insolence of Peace, Grasp golden Plenty: and provoke Increase. XVI. Oreb, with sympathetic Rapture fir'd, Starts from his Seat, impell'd by Gideon's Flame: Shall Hebrews, then, by alien Gods inspir'd, For hostile Midian, point out Paths to Fame! Baal moves 'em!—I attest His dreadful Name: Blast He my Fortune, if, by me requir'd, This Hebrew's Hint re-starts my favourite Aim! Since, lately, half-resolv'd, we weigh'd this Scheme, Let us no longer willing Friends oppress: 'Tis Reason's Debt, Esteemers to esteem. Pay not propos'd Attachment, with Distress. Grant aidful Israel her indulg'd Desire: And turn War's Thunder on devoted Tyre. A few Days March conducts us to her Walls, Open, the Road; the Country stor'd, and gay, Sheds wanton Plenty o'er th'inviting Way. What can we want then?—Haste, at once, away. Surpris'd defenceless, now, while Fortune calls, All Hope forsakes 'em: and their City falls. XVII. Grave from his Place rose Zeb, in formal State: Heavy with Age; yet, Age his smallest Weight. Fortune had given him only Bliss to bear: But Nature heap'd him with a Load, of Care. His parsimonious Soul but ill could scan The Diff'rence, 'twixt the Monarch, and the Man. Courage he wanted not: but held in vain— For, his chief End, in every War, was Gain. Deep, in his labour-furrow'd Look, his Av'rice stood engrav'd: And even his Silence told the Eye, he crav'd. This Tyrian War, says He, has my Consent. Rich is the Country: praiseful the Intent. Since Israel's Right of Kindred, we confess, Let us her Poverty no harder press. E'en let her, once for All, her Tribes assess: And, gath'ring friendly what she can, buy off th'undue Distress. Pity pleads for 'em. We can do no less Than let 'em hold, in Peace, their thin Remains. Spare the poor Penitents.—Alas! Their Plains Were, long since, Ours; Their Mountains yield small Gains: And lean Contention is not worth our Pains. Sidon and Tyre with endless Wealth abound: A thriving People! skill'd in gainful Arts! Commerce their Treas'ry fills: Herds hide their Ground. Trade a big Weakness proudfully imparts: But trembling Hands ill guard presumptuous Hearts. XVIII. Agag, of Amalek, sat next: A Prince, of temper'd Courage; wisely cold. No rising Passion His slow Thought perplex'd: Doubtful, with Vigour, and with Caution, bold. A long Experience taught him to suspect: He fear'd All Counsels; but would none neglect. Justly he weigh'd: and did, with Choice, reject. Alike 'twould grieve me, the wise Prince began, To miss the Meaning, or mistake the Man. Yet, least errs He, who weigh'd Conclusion draws; And, seeking Consequence, looks back to Cause. Mischief, disguis'd, may deep and dang'rous lie: Pow'rless to hurt when obvious to the Eye. Grant us of Strength to shake the Walls of Tyre: Grant the March short: Have we not Foes, still nigher? These Hebrews, wisely weary of us here, Kindly provide us nobler Conquests, near. Strong is our Hope: but stronger is Their Fear. Old Claims of Blood, from Dates so sunk in Time, Impel but faintly, where no Int'rest leads. One Step still higher, retrorsive let 'em climb, And, since so strongly Kindred pleads, Canaan's whole Offspring, ev'n her Tyrian Race, Name Parent Noah, but, in Abr'am's Place, Are Midian's Brothers, with like Claim to Grace. Last Night—nor think Night Visions always vain; Oft, they the Wills of silent Gods, explain. Last Night, This strange, this thrice-repeated Dream, Harrow'd my aking Fancy, with the Sight Of air-form'd Shapes, that chill'd my Soul to Fright! For, ne'er did Shadows so substantial, seem! I saw you, Princes! in th'imperial Tent Assembled, as we now, collective, meet, And on like Business bent: When, from yon sable Mountain's dire Descent, Fast in Pursuit of warlike Oreb's Feet, Roll'd a mean rustic Loaf, of Hebrew Bread. On-bigg'ning, into monstrous Bulk It spread; Till, gradual, an unbounded Pile, It grew: Whelming its Way, These Royal Seats o'erthrew. Then, rumbling, thunder-like, resistless, round, Swept the crush'd Camp before it, to the Ground. Taught, by such Dreams— —There, Oreb held, no more: But, rising stormy, look'd him scornful o'er. Take heed, presumptuous Prince! nor dare, said He, Oblique, to glance reproachful Doubt, at me. Dream for Thyself: hintful of base Distrust, Creep beneath Faith, through allegoric Dust. Souls, sagely impotent, or darkly cold, Ever suspicious, thus alarm'd, behold Th'uncover'd Climb, of Honour's active Flame: And dive through Virtue, for some mystic Aim. Dishonest Mark, of an infected Mind! Whom should I fear? What View shall I conceal? Who shall prevent, where Oreb has design'd? Or, what, resolving, shuns he to reveal? No.—Be it left to cautious Lumps, like Thee, To veil fear'd Truths, or through False Mediums see; My Heart's hot Beat on its felt Strength, relies; And flames too furious, to admit Disguise. But, by revenging Baal!— XIX. —There, Zebah rose: A Man of Noise, and apt to interpose. Vain-glorious, insolent, and rashly brave! His Courage, deaf to Danger, sought his Foes: But, to his Friends, unsure Dependence gave; Bold, to destroy: but ign'rant how to save! Impetuous he began; and stream'd in Tongue: Round roll'd his Eyeballs; and his Arms, in tum'rous Gesture, swung. Oreb watch'd stern, for what He meant to say: And Agag, half-enrag'd, before, now smil'd his Warmth away. What! must we, thus, in civil Broils engage? And can we find no foreign Wars, to wage? Last, let us jarr: nor will it then be vain, When None to conquer, but Ourselves, remain. But, let us, first, march on, to shining Tyre: And leave Her brighter, in her fun'ral Fire. I hate her: proud Engrosser of the Seas! The wafted Pilf'rer floats from Shore to Shore; Freighted for Luxury, and choak'd with Store While we, far nobler, dumbly unrenown'd, Short-elbow'ing, from our Mountain's circly Bound, Harrass, with faint and fameless Force, the hardy Nations, round. Were Navies ours, what could not Midian do? Then, might we Toils worth bleeding for, pursue: Find some new World, possess, and drain it, too: And spread the Glory of our Arms, where Fame, yet, never flew. Now, barr'd by Rocks, or hemm'd by barren Sands, Why call'd they happy such secluded Lands? Our crouded Hive ejects reluctant Swarms. But, when yon Eastern Ocean's Depth, behind, Shall groan beneath th'Excursion of our Arms; Or, o'er th'Atlantic West, we Outlet find; Then shall we grasp a Pow'r, like Zebah's Mind! Then shall the Nations trembling ask, what Midian has design'd: And our wide-dreaded Name be heard, in Ev'ry changing Wind. Since Agag, safely cautious, shuns to go, And sees sure Danger, in an untry'd Foe, Be it His guardian Task, to watch, behind: Distinct, in two strong Pow'rs, our Army, led, At once, shall hold yon Hebrew Dames confin'd, High, on their Mountain's wholsome Tops, to whiten, in the Wind; And shake presumptuous Tyre, with Midian's Dread: Faint-hearted Slaves, in their own Purple bred; By Pleasure soften'd, and by Plenty fed: Our tawny Soldier's iron Front, shall look the Miscreants dead. XX. Zalmunna smil'd, at Zebah's hope-wing'd Flight, And spoke, resolv'd to close the warm Debate. This Prince assum'd an all-superior Might: Honour'd in chief, by Each divided State; Tho', by Descent, and Right of nat'ral Claim, Lord but of One, to the mix'd War, he came. Haughty and fierce, his daring Bosom felt A savage Pleasure, in the Wastes of Woe: His cruel craft-revolving Depth of Mind Dark distant Schemes, of tyrant Reach, design'd: No Warmth of Pity his hard Heart could melt; All Things were just, which rid him of a Foe: All was beneath him, in the World below: And Heav'n but bow'd to, that it might bestow. Princes! said He, well-judg'd, Your Hopes appear. Yet, you misconstrue Agag's Caution, Fear. Skill'd in Discernment, let the Wise detect, And point out Dangers, for the Brave's Neglect. On, to the West: be Tyre's proud State defy'd. Israel, oft already try'd, Dares nothing: or must dare on Midian's Side. Phœnicia's peopled Coast, This March makes Ours. Then lie These Hebrews central, 'twixt our Pow'rs. Southward and Eastward, we, already, spread, And edge their Tribes, with a removeless Dread. Northward, accessless Hills run rough'ning on, From Arnon's Ridge, to ced'ry Lebanon: Add the wish'd West; and the Sea's subject Roar Salutes stretch'd Midian, and adorns her Shore. So, hemm'd on ev'ry Side, and, each Way, near, Hope Israel's Service; and conclude her Fear. Peacefully safe, a Vassal, calm and still: Or conquer'd Rebel, to be crush'd, at Will. Hebrew! return: and, soon as thou shalt hear That our resistless Arms encompass Tyre, Bid your Twelve Tribes chuse, Each, a Legate, fit To kneel before us with their joint Desire. Hope, then, what Terms Compassion can admit: Away.—Find Comfort: and your Caverns quit. Princes! debate no more. It stands decreed. Sidon must fall: and purply Tyre shall bleed. Baal! bless To-morrow's Dawn; safe-guard Thy Host! Push we the March, ere Spies alarm their Coast. Gideon glow'd secret; pleas'd, prophetic, gay: And Each King, rising, mov'd, a sep'rate Way. But, Oreb's gen'rous Heart, humanely bent, Studious to entertain his Hebrew Friend, Led him, impatient, to his feastful Tent: Where social Hours, in charmful Converse spent, Brought the pleas'd Day to an unwilling End. XXI. All Night, the Camp hums loud, with murm'ring Swarms, And rings with Echoes, from the hammer'd Arms. Through ev'ry Quarter, hurrying Concourse pours: And Preparation toils away the Hours. At last, the chearful Morning's op'ning Eye Glows, through the solemn Shade, from high: Hov'ring, and moist, attracted Vapours rise. Then, the Sun's Outset, seen and hail'd, with day-discov'ring Cries, In worship'd Pomp, rolls glorious up, to Sight: And ev'ry ray-touch'd Mountain smiles, and ev'ry Field looks bright. First, the loud Drums a solemn Warning beat, And Each rous'd Soldier, prompt to War's Alarms, Strong, for the notic'd Movement, girds his Feet: Then, the shrill-starting Trumpet sounds to Arms; And All the swarthy Nations run, and at their Standards meet. Slow, move the cumb'rous Waggons, long in Train, And, dull of Motion, creek with Weight; and labour o'er the Plain. Next, loaded high, the bunchy Camels go; Stepping, with strait-rais'd Neck, sublimely slow: One loose-ty'd Length of living Line, in stretch'd and endless Row. With These, for Safeguard from th'attempting Foe, Selected Bands, of active Horsemen, ride: A dreadful Battle-ax adorns each Side; And each right Hand, a double-pointed Spear, To dart a distant Death, or guide one, near. These, first, off-filing, the whole following Host Receiv'd joint Signal, and to move began: Each in his Turn, wheel'd martial, from his Post, Rank behind Rank, and Man preceding Man. XXII. Seen, from a Chariot, on a rising Ground, Along whose Range the Army must ascend; Or, near, beneath whose Brow their Way they found, Oreb sat mounted, with his Hebrew Friend. Thence, as the Squadrons pass'd, with courteous Care, Inform'd him, whence they came, and whose they were. My Friend, said he, for, from this happy Day, Let us forever, mutual, share That Name: It joys me, that our Forces march away, And yield wish'd Peace, to Israel's future Claim. Swift let your Legates sent, firm Contract, bind. Proud and imperious is Zalmunna's Mind! But I, to aid your Envoy's purpos'd Pray'r, Will, with a warm and well-asserted Care, Curb his malignant Hate; and make him kind. Mean while, this fair Occasion, safely take, To sit, and well observe our martial Host. No Strength, brave Nations, thus ally'd, can break. Such Weight oppressing, if we felt you shake, This Truth, confess'd, secures your Country's Praise; Sev'n Years assaulted, you withstood us, All: While in perhaps as few triumphant Days, Before our death-diminish'd Pow'r, the Pride of Tyre shall fall. All the wide Bosom of the spacious East Had empty'd her Best Spirits, on your Land: 'Tis true, by Time's wide Waste, and War's, decreas'd, Many have fall'n: nor has my Loss been least. Yet shall you see the Numbers we command Thick, as the Locusts in the Wind, and countless as the Sand. Be it your Glory, you could Kings, withstand, Who grasp'd your State with such a nervous Hand. XXIII. In Five broad Lines, th'advancing Army moves. For, where smooth Plains extend unbroken Way, Wide Order, ev'ry practis'd Chief approves; As least expos'd, so stretch'd, in form'd Array, And making double Marches, ev'ry Day. See, clear 'twixt Line and Line, what Space we leave: Some Furlong's Interval, unfill'd and free: Hence, no Impression, we, when charg'd, receive, Can, through more Lines than One, extended be: But All, each other, aptly may relieve; And, where One shrinks, th'advancing Next retrieve. Mark this approaching Front, with heedful Care. My Ensigns only, All These Squadrons bear. I know not how, of late, so chang'd, they were! They want not Skill: and have been us'd to dare. See, how their Wings with Iron Chariots shine! On either Horn Four hundred. Each of These Bears Two arm'd Drivers, whom Three Horses draw, Train'd to give Charge in a broad-breasted Line. Impatient of the Curb, they bound, and paw! From each strong Point of death-arm'd Axle-trees, Sharp-cutting Scythes emerge, with edgy Slant: These, in revertive Bend, we move, at Ease; Rais'd, or declin'd, as the skill'd Guiders please. But, when out-driv'n, to rush upon the Foe, Rattling aloud their brazen Wheels advance, How weak and useless are the Sword and Lance! Rider and Horse, cut through, they overthrow: And while the shaft-arm'd Archers, from within, Point missive Deaths, in dreadful Tempest, round, The loose-main'd Coursers, with impetuous Din, Burst through the Ranks, and thunder o'er the Ground, With rapid Motion some, they trample down: Others, who, thronging back, evade their Force, The raz'ry Scythes with reeking Edges sweep; And mow destructive, in their bloody Course. Of these Eight hundred, which you, passing, see, Six hundred have no other Lord, but me. Two hundred, watry Moab's Monarch owns: Our Lands conjoin: confed'rate are our Thrones. XXIV. Now, mark my Foot: in Three Divisions led The Midmost holds my Country's bravest Sons: Firm Souls; to great and long-try'd Dangers, bred. Cross our Dominions, ridgy Gilead runs: Gilead, whose Groves sweat sov'reign Balm, to heal The Wounds, her brave Defenders rush to feel. Twelve thousand These; who, once, in Arms unskill'd, The palm-producing Plains of Midian till'd. Or scoop'd fall'n Cedars, on her Mountain's Side: And, in light Floats, on fishy Arnon, ply'd. Those to the right, confed'rate Moab sends, Eight thousand Spearmen, arm'd in radiant Steel: Bold Hiram leads 'em; Midian's high-priz'd Friends! We love their Courage: nor their Worth conceal. Near fenny Nebo, and moist Hesbon, They, Cities, loudly known to Fame! Dwell in deep Vales, whose rich, but stubborn, Clay Does strong Resemblance to their Nature claim: Valiant; but hardly modell'd to obey! Who has not heard what Giants they o'erthrew? Emims and Anakims, of duskiest Hue! Broad-striding Champions! big-bon'd Monsters, All! Hard, as their Oaks: and, as their Cedars, tall! Near us here, my Foot's firm Left Contains five thousand, Aids, from Ammon sent. North-East, from Moab, bord'ring Ammon lies: These also, Giants, of their Land bereft. Ev'n to this Day, the Realm, a Giant Race, supplies. In Rabba's Town, a Proof of strange Extent! The iron Bed of Og, may, yet, be seen: In Length, Nine Cubits—Four such Cubits, wide! You know the Story well. His fatal Pride, Vast, as his Bulk, your happier Arms defy'd: And, by the Hand of your Great Chief, he dy'd. On their Hill's healthy Top, delightfully serene, A Soil, with Sage, and Rue, and Wormwood, green, Their luckless Balak stood to curse your Race: When Balaam bless'd you, to his Lord's Disgrace. These three distinct Divisions, I command; Our Army's first, and not her weakest, Line. Warm Emulation flames, through ev'ry Band: Fearless of Death, in War's lov'd Pomp they shine. See! how through Clouds of Dust they march: nor Heat, nor Labour, shun! With glowing Temples urge their Way, and sparkle, in the Sun! XXV. But look!—The Army's Second Line comes on. These, too, from Midian, mighty Founder! spring. Hard, as their hilly Country's native Stone, They serve a rich, but an ungen'rous, King. Mean as their Monarch's Mind; their Dress, how plain! Zeb's homely Spirit, in his plumeless Train. Five thousand Foot, thrice told, this Prince attend. Three thousand Slingers, upon Camels, ride. From This rais'd Centre, his Foot Cohorts bend, And, Right and Left, two equal Wings, extend: Which, rounding forward, Each with sharp'ning End, In hollow Compass, deep, at once, and wide, March, like a Crescent, in whose midst, their sullen Prince they hide, Experienc'd Archers, These. Their left Hands bear Tough and springy Bows, of Steel. Arms of slender Proof they wear: And the big Shield's safe Weight abhor to feel. Across their Shoulders, loose, with careless Air, Hang Quivers, stor'd with Arrows sharp and strong: Hark! how they sound, as they step swift along. From rock-built Selah, a secure Defence, For weak-soul'd Avarice, and Wealth immense, These half-dress'd, rough, unsightly Squadrons came: Neighbours to Hor, a Desart known to Fame For many a Chance! with one, by you, supply'd: 'Twas there, your venerable Aaron dy'd. Southward, from Moab's Plain, the Region runs: And borders, eastward, upon Edom's Sons. Barren of Corn: a harsh, ill-water'd Soil, Where Lab'rers, un-refresh'd, would die with Toil; Did not rich Vineyards round the Mountains twine, And float the thirsty Glebe, with Floods of Wine. XXVI. See, next, in haughty State, with conscious Pride, Sov'reign Zalmunna's tow'rd us, tow'ring, ride. Bounding, he leads our midmost Squadrons on: Too wide extended, to be half discern'd. This Monarch, who supreme Pretence, has won, In the dark Myst'ries of Ambition, learn'd, Rules but, by native Right, a distant Land: Midian's utmost Southern Bound; Along the rich Red Sea's indented Strand— Wide, that Tract, his Realms surround, Where your Great Moses, Jethro's Daughters, found. A Soil, that does with Ev'ry Growth abound, Tho' streak'd with tiresome Veins, of fruitless Sand, Ten thousand Horse, This mighty Sov'reign brings: Nervously rapid, as the Eagle's Wings! See! how, in Heat of Blood, they paw the Ground: And champ the Bit, and Sidelong prance: And tear up half the Plain, as they advance! His Foot, that, bright in Armour, wing those Horse, Are Thrice ten thousand, fam'd for wily Force: Unweary'd Veterans, of fearless Heart, All, deeply practis'd, in War's bloodiest Art: Us'd to All Arms; and try'd, in ev'ry Part. These Chariots, which, upon their Left, roll by, Obscur'd by Hills of Dust, which, with 'em, fly; Are Six dread Hundreds, arm'd and guided well: The same stretch'd Number, wid'ning from their Right, Would terrify your wond'ring Sight; But the long Distance tires the aking Eye. Zalmunna's Pow'r does All the King's excel: And what his Strength, and what his Aim, 'tis Time alone can tell. XXVII. But, This Way now, direct thy Eye; Where Agag, on his silver Chariot rides: Shining far, and seated high. Four milk-white Coursers, with hot-panting Sides, Vex'd to be curb'd, and struggling with the Rein, Draw him disdainful, o'er the smoaking Plain. This Prince is Lord of Amalek's wide State: His Seat is Pharan, and his Empire great. Arabia's, midmost, rocky Tract, He sways, Peopled by one of Ishmael's wand'ring Stems; Call'd Hagareens, from Hagar, Abra'm's Maid; The swarthy Mother of this rugged Race. Northward, his Lands, the wind-mov'd Desart hems: Where wandring Hords, in shifting Cities, dwell, Safe from the Sun, beneath their canvas Shade; Thence, swift as Roes, the Savage Wilds invade, To hunt the lordly Lion, from his Cell. Three thousand Horse, This crafty Monarch guides: Each a skill'd Archer, who, in rapid Flight, Turns in his Seat, and dext'rous, as he rides, Aims his Shaft backward, with a dreadful Slight, And, flying, kills more surely, than in Fight. These, in two dusky Cornets, sweep along; Wings, to That Centre, which, between, you see: Firm-wedg'd with hardy Foot, rang'd deep, and strong. Four times Five thousand, they are said to be: Abstemious Highlanders, All rough of Soul; Patient of Toil, but restive in Controul. XXVIII. Rash Zebah, last, brings up the gloomy Rear, Impetuous as a Tempest arm'd with Hail! All Passions shake him, in their Turns, but Fear: O'er his warm Hope, no Danger can prevail. Mark, with what martial Majesty he treads! Arm'd with a Spear, and looking fiercely round, On-foot, his Twenty thousand Foot, he heads: And measures slowly the unheeded Ground. Four hundred noisy Chariots wing this Band: And, yonder, boasting the same Chief's Command, Six thousand Horsemen, loosely spread, behind, Close the gay March: and, with elated Mind, Lift their high Standards, to the following Wind. Happy Arabia's aromatic Plains Stretch their sweet Bosoms, where this Monarch reigns: There, the rich Hills a gummy Harvest, shed; And Myrrh and Frankincense the Groves o'erspread. Ev'n from their Beasts, a musky Vapour flows: And the Spice-breathing Wind, with am'rous Softness, blows. From their broad Heaths, wild Thyme, and Camomil, Their coarsest Air, with breezy Fragrance, fill. Physic's wide Want, this druggy Tract supplies: Let the sick Elephant lie down to roll, From the crush'd Couch, balsamic Odours rise: And the snuff'd Scent revives his savage Soul. XXIX. As when some sudden News alarms a State, Of threat'ning Consequence, and full of Fear; All meaner Cares and Themes, suspended, wait: While This alone does worth Regard, appear. But, when by slow Degrees, the Rumour dies, And thought-recov'ring Crouds expect no more; Each to his proper Task his Care applies: And All is hush'd and languid, as before. So, while the Prince and Gideon heard the Noise, And saw the swarmy Legions passing by, No other Sound their hurry'd Ear employs; No other Object fills their busy Eye. But now, the Army past, the Sound scarce heard, And, each chang'd Prospect roll'd in Dust away, Pleas'd, they observe the Plains about 'em clear'd; The chearful Birds, above their Chariot, play: And Nature smiling round 'em, stilly gay. Then, Oreb, rising from his Chariot-Seat, Beck'ning, gave Sign, to a well-mounted Band; Which, shadow'd by a Grove's serene Retreat, At Distance, waited their lov'd Chief's Command. Sudden, they move; and closing in, behind, The Prince, reseated, shakes the loosen'd Rein: Fleet, his Horses, as the Wind, With sounding Hoofs, fly rapid o'er the Plain. XXX. While to the guarded Mountain's barr'd Ascent, Their eye-directed Way they bent, To Gideon, thus the gen'rous Oreb spoke: Since my illustrious Friend declines to take Such due Returns as grateful Sense would make, And merits Honour, but, for Virtue's Sake, What shall I do, to shew him my Regard Of Greatness, I confess, above Reward! It must be left to Time, and Chance, to find Some vast Occasion, for my Thanks design'd: Till when, the Debt must rest unpaid, to load my struggling Mind. Mean while; and, there, he from his Finger drew A Ring, that glitter'd, with a dazling Ray, From the most radiant Gem, that ere, in orient Quarries grew: Wear This—in Mem'ry, but, of what I owe; And, that I mean to pay. XXXI. Gideon, long-press'd, at last, averse, gave Way, And smil'd, with thankful Grace: when, hid below, On the Hill's Side, appear'd a Hebrew Band: Which, by the late Attempt, instructed well, Under a wary Chief's Command, Took Place, the Night before, to watch what pass'd, And future Mischief, in th'Advance, repel. These Gideon saw: and from the Chariot stept; Swift after him, Prince Oreb leapt: And, with a zealous Warmth of Heart, embrac'd. Then, courteous, took his Leave: and, all in Haste, Remounting, turn'd his Horses tow'rd the Host: And reach'd it soon, and foremost shone; conspicuous in his Post. BOOK III. I. While to the Host his Way Prince Oreb bent, And urg'd his flying Coursers o'er the Plain; Gideon climb'd slow the Mountain's steep Ascent, Oppress'd with Thought, and anxious for th'Event. Deep he revolv'd, with soul-afflicting Pain, What strange Success had crown'd his first Intent, Crown'd with Success, in vain, Should the chief Labour of his Hope imperfect, still, remain. The Foe remov'd might soon receive Alarm, And, doubly fierce, return, should Israel arm. Well had he mark'd, and weigh'd, their dreadful Skill; Their countless Numbers, their rapacious Will: And All their fine and vary'd Arts, to kill. How should dejected Israel, then, make Head? Who should effectual Summons, spread? Or, did they meet, how hopeless still, they would, by Him, be led! Much he reflected, on the gen'rous Aid Of Oreb's Friendship: mixing Hope, with Pain. For, while Zalmunna's barb'rous Pride he weigh'd, Zeb's Av'rice; Agag's Caution; Zebah's Rage: Wisdom's cool Doubt awaken'd sad Presage, That One Man's Truth might leave Dependence vain: Where fraudful Numbers join'd, averse, its Influence to restrain. Distracted thus, amid the hurry'd Sway Of cross-cours'd Passions, clashingly, combin'd; Deeply perplex'd, he climb'd his pensive Way: And, now, despairing, human Schemes, resign'd. Now, thought of Heav'n, and left all Doubt behind. II. But, while, in Midian's Camp, his active Thought Had, wisely lab'ring, trac'd his Country's Good, His Country's Sons, by no such Virtue taught, With equal Ardour their own Bliss withstood. For, 'mid th'o'ermantling Stillness of the Night, While Gideon, late, had hew'd the Grove's vast Oak, The Priest of Baal, who, on the Mountain's Side, Cavern'd, in solitary Silence dwelt, Heard the loud Echoes bound, from each bold Stroke, Which the Trunk, repugnant, felt: Saw the fierce Flame revolve its blazy Light, Whirl'd through the Gloom, and trembling to his Sight. Scarce his astonish'd Soul believ'd Th'alarming Witness, which his Senses bore! Fearing, yet longing, to be undeceiv'd, Th'apparent Truth, still nearer, to explore, Cautious he climb'd the Hill, with quiv'ring Knees. There, safe, behind the Shade of sheltry Trees, Chill'd with Amazement, he had stood, and watch'd, While Gideon and his faithful Ten, their daring Task, dispatch'd. III. But, when the pious Hebrew left the Place, And silent Horror o'er the Ruin reign'd; Soft, the Priest, with tim'rous Pace, Crept from his Covert; now no more restrain'd; And, ghastly gazing o'er the naked Ground, On which the dying Embers faintly shin'd; View'd the accomplish'd Desolation, round. There, when no Remnant of his God he found, Soul-freezing Horror ic'd his coward Mind! Bath'd in the dew-drench'd Darkness of the Night, Trembling he stood; un-man'd with inward Dread; If an Owl scream'd, he started into Fright; And shrunk from ev'ry sighing Wind, that skimm'd his palsy'd Head. Slow, the press'd Ground beneath him seem'd to rise, Gradual a Groan broke mournful from below: Out-roll'd a dusky Form, that brush'd his Eyes; And, gliding upward, ceas'd not still to grow: Huge, as the Oak it rose from, It appear'd: And its vast Reach, unmeasurably, rear'd! Death-like, It rais'd an Arm, but half reveal'd: For, ambient Clouds the shadowy Dart conceal'd, Two ghastly Meteors, lost within its Head, With emb'ry Glare pal'd o'er its spect'ry Eyes: Sicklying the Sable, with a bloodshot Red; Whose glimm'ry Semblance, in appearing, dies. Nothing distinct was seen: yet, each dark Part Mov'd, in convulsive Writhe, and seem'd to smart. IV. This was the Guardian Dæmon of the Grove; Who, 'gainst superior Pow'r, too weakly strove: Forc'd, from his Charge, in tortur'd Shame withdrew; But, now, reproachful, vaunted, o'er the View. —Wretch! too unmindful of my Shrine, and me! Why hast thou suffer'd this atrocious Deed? Trusting Thy Vigilance, and Piety, Thee, my Grove's sacred Guardian, I decreed: Myself, from Care of my own Altar, freed. But, by thy Absence, or Neglect, betray'd, Rising, I find my holy Hill profan'd: Day's influent Range supplants my fav'rite Shade; Burnt is my Image: and my Honour stain'd. But one Way, now, canst thou Perdition, shun, And 'scape th'eternal Anguish, of my Hate: Detested Gideon, this bold Act has done. Go: while he dares new Mischiefs meditate: Go: rouse the faithful Ministers of Fate; Drag him, expell'd, from the curs'd City's Gate. Headlong, go, hurl him, o'er the Mountain's Brow. So, expiate Ophra's Guilt: and save the State, From high-doom'd Vengeance, that o'er-hangs it, now. This not perform'd, presume no more to raise Altars, or Groves, to my insulted Praise. Unexpiated Sins move Heav'n, in vain: Go: act my Sentence—or my Rage sustain. V. So threat'ning, mounted on a Flash, he rose: And, in a Peal of Thunder, tow'r'd away. Kindling behind, an Arch of Sulphur flows, And streaks his Passage, with a Trail of Day. Far from the Mount, with gradual Slope, he fell: And, light'ning downward, sought his native Hell. Thus, when, in War, the death-embowell'd Ball Slants upward, o'er some hostile Mark, to fall; In fiery Curve th'exploded Mischief flies; And sweeps, thick-sparkling, through the measur'd Skies: Till, on the destin'd Point, its Weight declines; And, bursting broad with flashful Force, for circly Ruin, shines. Who can describe the Pangs, which now opprest The panting Heathen's superstitious Breast! Aw'd, and un-soul'd, beneath th'unruly Fright, Still, his Ears echo'd, to the Groans of Night: Still the thin Phantom skimm'd before his Sight. Wildly devout, and stung by frantic Zeal, Swift, to the Remnant of the hallow'd Oak, Fearful, with wide-extended Arms, he ran: In pious Pity the mourn'd Trunk, to clasp; Weep its dry Wounds, and warm 'em with his Grasp. So, tir'd with Ecstasy, and toil'd with Dread, While his age-wasted Spirits flow'd away; Down sunk the sleep-attracted Sage's Head: And, senseless as his Oak, supine he lay. VI. There while he slept, unconscious what was done, High, o'er his Weakness, rose the smiling Sun. When Joash, mindful of the Grove o'erthrown, Ent'ring the Town, with wise and early Care, Anxious to make its Motive timely known, Found the sought Senate close assembled there. Of these, Eliakim, with fruitless Pain, Had long regretted Israel, left by God: Long had he view'd her Rashness, with Disdain, And trac'd Destruction, in the Paths she trod. Yet, taught by Pity, to attemper Zeal, Patient, he waited some adaptive Chance, That might contribute Balm, her Wounds to heal, And her true Int'rest, to his Hopes, advance. He, lately, busying many a trusty Scribe, In secret Correspondence practis'd well, Had one charg'd Levite, drawn, from Ev'ry Tribe; Safely, such Schemes, to ponder, and prescribe, As dang'rous Distance made it rash, to tell. Chiefly, he wish'd more Weight, in Levi's Scale: Conscious that Freedom must, with Faith, prevail: But little guess'd he, 'midst his cool Design, How God, on Gideon, had vouchsaf'd to shine: Less dreamt He of the Idol Grove destroy'd; Or what new Wonders his vast Views, employ'd. Ev'n now, deputed, from the sacred Race, Twelve aweful Delegates, commission'd, came: Men, of high Wisdom, and distinguish'd Grace! Propell'd, by pulsive Heav'n, beyond their Aim. Now, first, in Ophra's Senate, taking Place, They learnt, from Joash, what, That Night, was done: Learnt, how an Angel had inspir'd his Son, Baal's consecrated Altar to destroy: Learnt, with Astonishment, too strong for Joy! That, with commission'd Flame, His shining Hand Would rise, his Country's blazing Soul; and free th'illumin'd Land! VII. While they, yet list'ning, weigh'd th'alarming Tale, Th'awaken'd Priest with loud Complaint rush'd in: Roar'd the hot Wrath of violated Baal; And urg'd due Vengeance, on th'all-damning Sin. The wise Assembly heard, in dumb Disdain; Yet scarce contain'd the Warmth, with which they glow'd: But now, cool Caution, they to Prudence, ow'd. The People's Zeal, they knew, was fierce, and blind: Hence, outward Marks, of purer Fire, restrain, Till Faith's rais'd Torch might apt Effulgence, find. Grave Joash, slowly rising from his Seat, Soft, to th'impatient Priest, this Answer made. No more, thus loud, thy boist'rous Prayer, repeat: Heard were thy Words: and shall be duly weigh'd. No Son of Mine, I think, has, yet, been known Actor of any Deed, he dar'd not own. Gideon returning, charge him, to his Face: We, but for Justice, hold this aweful Place. VIII. 'Tis as I fear'd, th'outrageous Voice reply'd: Guilt has its Judges, on its Side: And, by th'Abettors of his Crime, th'Offender must be try'd. O Baal! dread Pow'r! distinguish, in thy Rage: Thou shouldst not, canst not, thus provok'd, thy purchas'd Wrath, asswage: Let it but on thy Foes, These Foes, be bent. Nor, with the Guilty, strike the Innocent. Speaking, he beats his quiv'ring Breast; his priestly Vestments rends: And, madly frantic, to the Streets, with out-stretch'd Arms, descends: There, on his Head, the gather'd Dust he threw, And, round him wide, th'inquiring Rabble, drew. To Ev'ry List'ner, he repeats his Tale; Tells the God's Wrath; and aggravates the Deed: Dwells, on the dreadful Apparition seen; Varies his Accents, and his Looks: and trembles, oft, between. The frighted Multitude their Fate bewail: Howl to the Priest, with Baal to intercede, And, from his Vengeance, Them and Theirs, to screen. Loud, and more loud, the rising Tumult grew; At length, All Ranks, into Itself it drew: And, roaring wild, outswell'd Controul; and Order overthrew. So, into Towns besieg'd, some stormy Night, A mischief-guided Fire-ball, secret, falls: It kindles, first, some Roof remote from Sight; Thence, breaks augmented, o'er the bord'ring Walls. Contiguous Houses catch th'infectious Flame, Which, tow'ring upward, meets the wafting Wind: Then, driv'n from Street to Street, with hungry Aim, O'er the whole Range, in blazing Sheets, inclin'd, Broad Wasters unresisted Passage find. Loud, into gather'd Rage, the mingled Fires, Combining, curl to Heav'n, with twisted Spires. United Help, to quench, now vainly aims: And crackling Ruin the wide Woe proclaims. IX. Alarm'd, by frequent and increasing Shouts, And terrify'd by Dread of vulgar Rage, The shock'd Assembly sat, involv'd in Doubts; Measuring slow Means, the Tumult to asswage. Till wise Eliakim, reflecting well, That Popular Distaste, to soothing Arts, Remits th'Intemp'rance of transported Hearts, Chose rather to prevent, than to repell. Down to the noise-distracted Streets he ran, Where, by the gen'rous Love of Peace, inspir'd, Feebly, with faint Advance, the Good old Man, Whelm'd in the Torrent of the Press, began To cool those Passions, which the Priest had fir'd. Oft, in vain, he strove to speak: Th'unlist'ning Rabble drown'd his Voice, in Roar: Tott'ring and push'd, by Age, and Anguish, weak, With stagg'ring Steps, and Arms uprais'd, he labour'd to implore. Sometimes, the dumbly sullen Multitude, Aw'd by his Presence, their wild Shouts forbore: Then, suddenly again, grew loud, and rude; And swell'd to stormier Madness, than before. So, on the angry Orient's rais'd Degrees, Some Bark, untimely, trusts repugnant Seas: To the black Whirlwind, shifts her heedful Helm, Careful to rise with ev'ry climbing Sweep, Which, met transversely, would her Side o'erwhelm; And plunge her found'ring, in the foamy Deep. Now shocks her surge-struck Stern: now shakes, her Head: There while she stays, check'd, motionless, and dead, Loud o'er her Quarter, roars, with deaf'ning Sound, Some sidelong Blast; that whirls her, dreadful, round. Now, for awhile, the slack'ning Wind gives way: And murm'ring Seas her answer'd Helm obey. Then, all at once new-wak'd again, the mad'ning Tempests roar: Deluge aloft her cover'd Decks; and wash her Topmasts o'er. So far'd Eliakim; on ev'ry Side Oppress'd, and floated with the should'ring Tide. Now, short-liv'd Silence listen'd to his Prayer: Now, thick'ning Clamour storm'd his Ear; and stunn'd him to Despair. X. Joash, who weigh'd his Int'rest in th'Event, Marks, and adopts, Eliakim's Distress. Following, he seconds the good Seer's Intent: Fast after Him, the rev'rend Elders press; And the twelve Levites, All, descend, to try their joint Address. Aw'd, by such strong-combin'd Authority, The Croud, whom one Man's Influence fail'd to sway, Give back, when they th'united Congress see; And, falling off, by slow Degrees, melt, murmuring, away. But, restless, in his Idol's Cause, to fail, All Day, from House to House, the Priest of Baal, With lab'ring Malice, urg'd the menac'd Fate, That lour'd incumbent, o'er the guilty State. Paintive, he shap'd a thousand fansy'd Woes, Woes, by their angry Deity resolv'd, Should they, relax'd, His known Command, oppose; And, in th'Offence unpunish'd, fall involv'd. XI. Night came: and, with a strong and sudden Blaze, The smother'd Embers, into Contact fann'd, Furious broke out, and shot rekindling Rays, That flash'd Destruction round, on ev'ry Hand. Gath'ring, with Swords, and Clubs, and Spears, and Staves, Hoarse as a Sea, the rising Rabble meets: With all its Tongues at once, the Monster raves; And, with the Roar of Rapine, shakes the Streets. Like some new Breach, too slightly stopt in Haste, And pil'd and turf'd, to bar the watry Waste: At first, effective, the short Hope is try'd: The Bank, triumphant, checks th'assaulting Tide. But, while, with dimply Smile, the Current glides, And, edging on, with treach'rous Smoothness slides; The sapping Moisture mines the Work, below, And, trickling gradual, eats, and pierces, slow: Then, gath'ring Strength, It flotes the soaky Mound; Loosens the Piles, and heaves 'em from the Ground: And All the Bank gives Way at once—and all the Fields are drown'd. XII. Eliakim, who judg'd, the People's Rage Would, to the House of Joash, drive their Aim, Found his precautious Hint no vain Presage: Thither, Baal's Priest directs the kindled Flame. But near each Portal, and the Hall of State, A faithful Guard, in martial Order plac'd, Oft as the Rabble press'd, withstood their Weight: Broke and repuls'd 'em; and, vindictive, chas'd. Oft thus dispers'd, oft making Head again, In Ebbs and Flows of Noise the Night was spent. Varying from Hopes to Fears, with pensive Pain, The Senate, list'ning, watch'd th'unsure Event. As Men well-hous'd, in wintry Storms of Rain, Hear, from without, the show'ry Tempest rise: Now, in calm Interval, the Wind blows low, And soft and short Suspensions hush the Skies. Then, the big Blasts, and sluicy Drifts, hoarse and impetuous, grow: And the strain'd Beams, in swelling Gales, groan conscious, from below. The Morning came; and cross'd the Senate's Hope; Which promis'd Peace, with the returning Light. But Day, restor'd, restor'd the rebel Scope, Of headstrong Range, that had been curb'd by Night. For, now, grown bolder, by their Number seen, Fierce on the guarded Hall, th'Assaulters press: The deep-rang'd Soldiers, firmly stretch'd between, In warlike Posture, each try'd Pass, possess. Here had Contention drawn a crimson Flood; And civil Fury stain'd her Face with Blood: But mild Eliakim, who, coolly, dar'd; Whose Heart, at once, was cautious, and prepar'd, From a high Gall'ry, fac'd the raging Croud; Taught 'em, by speechless Signs, how Madness err'd: Then, gath'ring, distant, round, they grew less loud, While the lov'd Sage thus charm'd the gaping Herd. XIII. Alas!—What Frenzy, my misguided Sons! Transports your honest, but impatient, Minds? Mistaking Zeal, when It thus blindly runs, Never the Path, to Reason, finds. Furious Revenge toils hard, for fruitless Ends: He must not, cannot, fall, whom God defends. Oh! be advis'd: fear Heav'n; not Baal; my Friends! Curs'd as we are, but, for this Idol Baal, Let not the Idol's Priest prevail. Now, ere Redemption's op'ning Path is trod, 'Twere an ill Time, t'offend a pard'ning God. Gideon—if Him, These rash Resolves pursue, Not uncommission'd, Sin's black Grove, destroy'd: Great are the Wonders, He was born to do! Your Faith's Redeemer, and your Freedom's, too. Blast not the promis'd Blessing, un-enjoy'd: Nor doubt his Triumph, since by Heav'n employ'd. Pensive, of late, beneath his Father's Oak, A shining Angel, from the op'ning Sky, Descending near him, God's Great Purpose, spoke. God spoke:—Hear Heav'n's Decree, proclaim'd from High. Israel requires him: and He shall not die. XIV. He ceas'd to speak: and the awe-silenc'd Throng Gaze on Each other, with repentant Air: Some bow their Heads, in conscious Shame: Some gape, with stupid Stare: Some weep, some pray; but All for Peace declare. Baal's Priest observ'd it; disconcerted, long: At last, determin'd, Craft's whole Force, to try, Loud, he broke out; with a reproachful Eye. —Is Baal grown pow'rless, since his Grove was fell'd? Or, by their formless, fansy'd, God, expell'd? That ye, thus lightly, lose your gen'rous Aim, And start, and tremble, at an empty Name! Were only Israel's Natives bless'd with Eyes? Are All the mightier Nations, round us, blind? Where dwells this sad, sole, Sov'reign, of the Skies, Whose House, no People, but the Hebrews, find? Greater, than Baal, since he pretends to be, Why fled we, from their Arms, who worship Baal? Sure! Such a proud, unpartner'd Pow'r, as He, Might lend his Vot'ries, Victory! If to inferior Gods, you must not bow, Let this Supreme one save you, now. If boastful Gideon has an Angel seen, Ne'er let His Party Baal's Resentment, fear. Since God's Arm stays him, Who can step between? Why flies he Tumults, if his Call was clear? Follow me bravely. We'll the Truth explore. If by our Hands he falls, we cut short Sin, And Baal shall frown no more. But, if His God's Protection walls him in, And from doom'd Vengeance his curs'd Head secures, Perish, even Baal! and Gideon's God, be yours! XV. He paus'd: and the will-wav'ring Multitude, Aw'd and hush'd but just before, Found their first Purpose suddenly renew'd: And burst, assentive, into savage Roar. Thus, o'er the blasted Heath, where Storms have blown, The light, thin, thistly, breath-obeying Down Hangs on the Air, a Plaything for the Wind: Moves, to each Breeze, and can no Balance find. Now, soft-sustain'd, sinks, indolently slow: Now, rises rapid on the Gale: and leaves the Birds, below. Aptly, the Priest, in Choice of Season, learn'd, The smiling Moment's op'ning Dawn discern'd. From the next Hand, he snatch'd a glitt'ring Spear: Haste to the Contest Each brave Soul, said he. Gideon and Baal dispute, for Israel's Fear. Whose Pow'r is greatest, come resolv'd to see: Let his God fight for Him: and mine for me. XVI. So threat'ning, to a Postern-Gate, with Speed He led the Way: and, after, rush'd the Throng. That Gate, he knew, was watch'd with slacken'd Heed: For, when, of late, the Croud swept, thence, along, With vow'd Resolve the Senate's Wall to force; Its Guard, off-call'd, to stem Distraction's Course, Swift-quitting That Out-post, had march'd away: Prompt for Defence, where likeliest Danger lay. By this new Chance surpris'd, the Gate gave way: Through the wide Arch, with throng'd and boist'rous Sway, Pours the mad Multitude, in shouting Swarms: With horrid Faces, wildly mix'd; and rage-collected Arms. Fierce, o'er the Mountain, raves th'impatient Throng: And, with the Rush of Ruin, roars along. Sicilian Ætna, thus, Eruption makes, When melted Sulphur swells her smoaky Lakes. Through the broad Mouth, out burst the flaming Tides: And roll their blazy Torrents down her Sides. Rampant the fiery Streams, un-chanel'd, flow: And, scorching dreadful, burn up Woods; and ride the Plains below. XVII. Joash, who heard, his House design'd for Prey, Thither, protective, wing'd his timely Way. There while with Vows and Pray'rs, bestow'd in vain, He urg'd his Friends thApproaches to maintain, Gideon appear'd: returning from the Plain. To meet him, trembling at his Sight, the tender Father flies: Tells the near Danger—and with watry Eyes Thus, the safe Counsel of his Love applies. Go, fated Youth! return: Thy Ruin shun. Never, till now, did I thy Presence hate. Pity thy Father's Fears, too daring Son! Nor to his Load of Woes add Thou the Weight, To make him Witness of Thy dreadful Fate. While he yet spoke, the Noise grew near and loud: And rising Dust proclaim'd th'arriving Croud. Gideon observ'd it: and, with pious Care, Thus, gen'rous, interrupts his Father's Pray'r. Rev'rend and wise! whose Wishes give me Laws; Fear were dishonest, in a Freeman's Cause. God, tho' a weak and worthless Hand he chose, Forbids his Soldier to avoid his Foes. Let 'em come on: They who in Numbers trust Raise tow'ry Models—but they build with Dust. He ceas'd.—but Joash, hopeless of Relief, Hung on his Neck, with speechless Tears: and look'd persuasive Grief. XVIII. Gideon, who held the Multitude in View, Clos'd his sad Father's pale and trembling Hand; In his brave Brother's: who, so charg'd, withdrew, Hous'd in safe Post, to make defensive Stand. Then, fac'd the Croud: chose a conspicuous Place: And stood, the great Protector, of his Race. As, when Arabian Hunters, in full Cry, Run down the tim'rous Stag, with preyful Eye, If, turning short, amid some winding Way, They start a Lion, grimly couch'd, for Prey, Sudden, the Dogs shoot wide: and, cow'ring low, Creep trembling backward; and their Chace forego: So, the transported and tumultuous Throng, Hot in their Rage, and rushing wild along, When, unexpectedly, they Gideon saw, Fell off, confounded; and oppress'd with Awe. God had impress'd him, with a Stamp divine; And o'er his Features beam'd an aweful Shine. Back'ning, they gaz'd, at Distance, on his Face: Admir'd his Posture; and confess'd his Grace. His Right Hand grasp'd his planted Spear, with nerv'd and manly Pride: His Left, bent careless, rested on his Side: Half-frown'd his Brow, resentive Wrath to feign; But his keen Eye smil'd cold, with sharp Disdain. Sudden, the Priest of Baal, who stood most near, Felt his Joints loosen with resistless Fear: And dropt, insensibly, his useless Spear. The pitying Hero mark'd the Croud's Surprize; And slow disarm'd the Rigour of his Eyes: Yet, with reproachful Air, the Silence broke— And, with high Voice, and aweful Mien, to the mix'd People spoke. XIX. Blood-thirsty Wasters of your Father's Fame! Haughty 'midst Woes! and wanton, ev'n in Shame! Why stop you short? Why cools your threat'ning Flame? Your Souls are worthy of your Aim. Baseness, by Nature, must all Danger, hate: Well add you therefore your whole coward Weight; To crush a Worth, you dare not imitate. Yet, whence could all this Waste of Anger flow? Did it, to Baal profan'd, such Transport owe? Weak is his Godhead, if sustain'd by You! Why does not Baal the Foes of Baal subdue? Omniscience, sure! like His, th'Offender, knew: Why did He not prevent him, too? Rash Fools!—by blind and feeble Zeal betray'd! Are Men their God's Protectors, made? Shall Baal who could not save Himself, find Pow'r to give you Aid? Oh! what a diff'rent God, your Fathers knew! No Help, from Earth, our Great Jehovah drew. From His own Hand, His blastful Lightnings flew. The dreadful Truth, when impiously deny'd, Proud Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, try'd: Leagu'd, against Moses—and misled, like you! While they, in Him, his God, and Theirs, defy'd; Deep, in the swallowing Earth's wide Yawn, o'erwhelm'd with Fire, they dy'd. No passive Baal, unprompt in his own Cause, Stood the dread Founder of your Laws; When, warranting Success, to Joshua's Arms, Ev'n at the Horn's unfear'd Alarms, Strong Jericho, in trembling Horror, falls: And Israel enter'd her, at Ease, led o'er her prostrate Walls. Was it Baal's Hand, that, baneful to your Foes, To time-stretch'd Slaughter, doom'd collected Force? Held back, twelve Hours, th'impatient Steeds of Night: And, on the Sun's declining Track, pour'd Floods of length'ning Light? Ungrateful! stubborn! ill-discerning Men! Why are you, now, less blest, than were your Fathers, then? Reigns Amalek, more pow'rful, in your Land, Than when you chas'd him, o'er his native Sand? But four, of Midian's Kings, remain our Foes: Five, against meek and age-worn Moses, rose. Twelve thousand Hebrews Those five Kings, o'erthrew: These four, (base Diff'rence!) twelve whole Tribes, pursue! Dream you, that Moab's present Chiefs excell That Eglon, who, by Ehud's Poniard, fell? Or, will your unman'd Race, in Bondage wait, Till some brave Woman rise, to save the State? Some second Deb'rah! skilful to inspire: And warm our heartless Sex, with female Fire? Go—since you burn with such resistless Rage, Go, in this Brav'ry, and your Foes, engage. Late, when at hand their shadowy Legions lay, When, on yon Plain, with your best Plunder, gay, Full in your Sight they shar'd your Flocks, in Prey; And led your Wives, and Infants, Slaves, away: Then was a Time, this Fury to display. But you, for warier Charge, reserv'd your Fire! To no such dang'rous Vict'ries, you aspire! Basely secure! from the proud Foe, you fly: And Those, who would efface your Shame, ingloriously defy! XX. He paus'd.—For, conscious Guilt, with Terror mix'd, Oppress'd the aw'd and speechless Multitude: In murm'ring Wonder, they had, first, been fix'd; But silent Expectation, now, ensu'd. When, panting breathless, 'twixt their Haste and Fear, The rev'rend Elders, who pursu'd the Croud, Brought up the sacred Twelve.—These, now drawn near, Th'impressive Voice of Gideon, sweetly loud, Wafted his charmful Music to their Ear. Then, with impatient Rapture fir'd, through the mov'd Throng they press'd, On the young Hero, laid their Hands: and his Great Purpose bless'd: Loud Pray'rs and Praise, to fav'ring Heav'n, address'd— To Heav'n, that re-assum'd lost Israel's Care; And shot bright Prospect, through her dark Despair. XXI. Baal's Priest, by slow Degrees, with straining Eyes, Wak'd into Reason; and repell'd Surprize: Much, his recov'ring Thought revolv'd the Fright, That, o'er his Soul, rose cold, at Gideon's Sight! Fain would he, still, conclude his Vision true: Yet, wonder'd, then, whence his Confusion grew! And why, if Baal inspir'd his Breast, he had not arm'd it, too! Dim, burnt His Zeal, while check'd by conscious Awe, The rev'rend Levite's purer Flame, he saw. His Taper, form'd for gross and gloomy Night, Absorb'd, in Day's more pow'rful Shine, lost half its trembling Light. At length, exerting Force to speak his Doubt, Thus, his faint Diffidence was murmur'd out. Much I applaud, brave Youth! your gen'rous Aim! Yet, ah! beware, lest ardent Thirst of Fame Disguise Ambition, with Religion's Name. Great was This God, if what we hear, from you, And what was heard by our dead Fathers too, Be not far more traditional, than true. These Wonders, Ages past pretend so known, Why are they not to us, poor Suff'rers, shown? Ask Baal's Believers, They, of Baal, unfold Potent past Trophies, pompously enroll'd: But one new Proof would more convince, than All th'uncertain old. He said: and pleas'd Concurrence catch'd his Voice. The Croud, th'Impression of his Doubt, receive: Let Gideon's God, they cry'd, now, own his Choice. Give us one Miracle: and we believe. XXII. Th'indignant Hero mark'd th'unfaithful Cry: But, all unable to comply, Pausingly thoughtful, roll'd his angry Eye. Strait—from a bushy Covert, near behind, Rush'd a grim Lion, furious after Prey: To rend some Sheep, the hungry Beast design'd, From a fair Flock, which, there, at Pasture lay. High, o'er his Back, his Tail, turn'd upward, wav'd; Rough and thorn-tangled hung his shaggy Main: His lank Sides, pining, miss'd the Food he crav'd. Red were his Eyes; and sparkled on the Plain. He saw the Press: and, with discov'ring Stare, Stood fix'd, awhile, in savage Glare: Then, with a Roar, that shook the Mountain round, Sprung on: and, like a Tempest, swept the Ground. This was a Lion, that, for many a Year, Had in the craggy Hill's dark Borders lain: And filling All the neighb'ring Towns with Fear, Was hunted, oft, in vain; By the swift Horsemen, late encamp'd, on Jezreel's grassy Plain. By frequent Danger, taught to shun the Vale, Where, in Times past, his Hunger had been fed, Hard-pinching heav'n-sent Want did now prevail: And led him searchful, to the Mountain's Head. XXIII. The frighted Flock, alarm'd, together rise: And bleating helpless skip, in Crouds, away. Fierce in Pursuit the greedy Savage flies: And while, amid the Multitude, they for Protection stray, The Croud, as much alarm'd as They! Roll o'er each other, a promiscuous Prey. Close before Gideon's Feet, with joyful Roar, The leaping Lion stretch'd his Paws, and one poor Bleater, tore. Back stept the Hero; and grasp'd hard his Lance: And watch'd, with lifted Arm, his next Advance. Thou shalt not safe return, said he, that dar'st presume, thus near, In Spoil of Innocence, to shake off Fear. Sudden, he saw the Beast in Act to rise: And, swift as Thunder, downward aim'd a Wound. Deep, through the Monster's gaping Throat, the bury'd Weapon flies; Vindictive Fires flash'd Lightning from his Eyes: Half an imperfect Roar its Passage found; And the nail'd Monster, quiv'ring, beat the Ground. XXIV. The ravish'd People their Applauses shout; And Every busy Tongue its Wonder told: To the dead Lion gath'ring wide about, Th'extended Monster they with Joy behold: Astonish'd at an Act so timely bold! Gideon, just then, with glowing Foresight fir'd, Stoop'd, by directive Heav'n inspir'd; And, round him, from the death-disorder'd Ground, Gather'd a snow-white woolly Fleece, the Lion's Paws had spread: Then freed his Spear from the retentive Wound, And, wiping off th'ensanguin'd Red, Wreath'd in a soft and milky Roll, the Lance's shining Head. Approach, ye stubborn Infidels! said he, Ye, who are Lions, where but Sheep, you see! And tim'rous Sheep, where ye should Lions, be! Once more That God, who set your Fathers free, Unworthy as you are! will let you know, That Israel, penitent, may prosp'rous grow. XXV. This said, in his Left Hand he took the Lance, And held it, with its woolly Crown, erect: Then, rais'd his aweful Right, with slow Advance; And bow'd his Knee to Heav'n, with deep Respect. Dumb, the still Multitude attentive gaz'd: Hush'd! expectant! and amaz'd! While Gideon thus invok'd That God, who his new Hope had rais'd. Thou! sacred, high, un-utterable, Name! To whom lost Israel ow'd her antient Fame, From whose just Anger flows her present Shame; Pity thy devious People's harden'd Hearts; Grosly deceiv'd, by Hell's too busy Arts. Let some strong Influence force 'em to believe: What their Soul sees not, let their Sense conceive. If, by thy Servant's weak and worthless Hand, Thou wilt save Israel, and her Pow'r increase; Let show'ry Rains descend, at Thy Command, And nothing dry remain, but this soft Fleece. XXVI. Scarce the pow'rful Pray'r was spoke, When, from the West, a startling Thunder broke; Continuous, and advancing still more strong, Gradual it roll'd its length'ning Burst, along. Fast after it, black gath'ring Clouds arise: And, circling dusky, sadden all the Skies. First, a weak Wind, with hollow Faintness, sings; And shakes soft Moisture from its sleepy Wings. Now, the wet Breeze, with more collected Force, Thickens its Breath; and blows direct, and hoarse. Then, the big Drops, in drowning Fierceness, fall: And rushing Rains come driving, over All. Rebounding Torrents the hard Surface dash: And smoaking Floods the darken'd Mountain wash. The People turn their Faces from the Show'r: And, on their Backs, feel the broad Cat'ract pour. Gideon, mean while, upon the rising Ground, In a bright Ring, the heav'n-taught Floods surround. On Him no straggling Drop presumes to fall: For, o'er his Fleece, a sun-resembling Ball Rolls guardful round, to slope the Show'r away: And shows him, glitt'ring, in abstracted Day! Behold! ye unbelieving Souls! he cry'd: See! what a God you have defy'd; And learn, from This, Who fights henceforth, on happy Israel's Side. The People shout to Heav'n their raging Joys: And Baal's Priest, trembling, sickens, at the Noise. XXVII. Once more, my God! cry'd Gideon, yet, once more, Indulge the vary'd Sign their Doubts implore. Call off these Rains: unflote the delug'd Ground— And, when All else is round me dry, wet let the Fleece be found. Th'Almighty heard: and, swift as rapid Thought, Reverted Show'rs to Heav'n are caught. The beamy Sun, again, shoots down his Rays: And, burns restor'd, with a triumphant Blaze. The flaming Air ejects irradiate Heat: And cross-flash'd Lightnings, in descending, meet. As when some sudden Whirlwind's circly Sweep Drives the light Straws, and lifts each scatt'ring Heap, Smoothing the Surface in its winding Way: So, the keen Radiance, curv'd and quiv'ring round, Mazy and wanton in its vary'd Play, Curls its flash'd Progress o'er the hissing Ground: And close-adhering to the steamy Soil, With its blue Tongues, licks up the Flood; and works, with fiery Toil. The Fleece, mean while, which swelling Moisture fills, The raptur'd Croud behold with glowing Souls: From its soft Sides, a trickling Stream distils; And down the Hill, in a thin Current, rolls. This when they saw, they on their Faces fell; Struck with an Awe, which Hope could scarce repell: They felt a pain-mix'd Joy, they could not tell. But, in joint Voice, with gen'ral Ardor fir'd, Lead us, they cry'd, Thou Chief, by Heav'n inspir'd! Govern our State: for, under Thy Command, Ophra, first blest, shall bless th'awak'ning Land. Thus, was the People's Voice the Voice of God. Gideon smil'd graceful, with assentive Nod. On, to the Town, said he: Assembled, there, These rev'rend Sages shall my Purpose share; Aid my Endeavours; and divide my Care. XXVIII. Op'ning, they move, mid Triumph's wildest Noise, Ungovernably wanton, in their Joys: Baal's Priest, still, foremost, leads the shouting Throng; Converted, to the other, best, Extreme! Leaping, and turning, as he pass'd along, The Praise of Israel's God, was, now, his Theme. Next, came the mix'd and swarming Multitude; With All their Tongues, and All their Hands, employ'd: Long Trains of Dust their peopled Path pursu'd. Then, was a short, respectful, Space, left void, For the charm'd Elders, two preceding two. 'Mong'st These, the good Eliakim, o'erjoy'd, Oft, turn'd, the following Hero's Face, with new Delight to view: Arm'd with his fleecy Spear, distinguish'd far, Gideon adorn'd his happy Father's Side; Now, burst, o'erjoy'd, from his domestic Bar, And fill'd with All a Parent's virtuous Pride! Near, after Gideon, the Twelve Levites came; Their Eyes on Heav'n, in rev'rend Wonder, bent: Their Souls contemplatively fir'd, with God's decreed Intent! Last, march'd the Soldiers, rang'd in length'ning Band; These, from the City, had pursu'd the Throng; Hast'ning, their menac'd Fury to withstand. But, charm'd, now hail th'Event, of purpos'd Wrong: Guard back their loud-acknowleg'd Lord: and, martial, mov'd along. XXIX. Ophra regain'd, to Council they ascend: Senate and Legates share divided Place. Moony, they, round their great Deliv'rer, bend: Who fills the Centre, with majestic Grace. Mild, from his Eyes, the radiant Fire to chase, A Smile, of soft Humanity, unbends his placid Face. As when, by Night, through some still Forest's Walks, A Swain, from whom his fav'rite Child has stray'd, 'Twixt the dark Shrubs, in list'ning Silence, stalks; And, joyful, starts, at ev'ry rustling Shade: Breathless, turns short, attentive, to the Wind; And hopes, in ev'ry whistling Breeze, an Infant's Cry, to find. So tender, and so still, when Gideon spoke, Th'expecting Audience swallow'd Ev'ry Word: No breathing Sigh the solemn Silence broke; And scarce an air-suspended Atom stirr'd. XXX. Fathers of Israel! we have seen, this Day, That, if we will be bless'd, we may. God, ever gracious, has new Proof display'd, That Faith's Endeavour cannot want his Aid. Yet must not therefore Human Care be less: 'Tis Ours to labour; as 'tis His to bless. Heav'n but inspires us with a Will to chuse; Reason weighs Means; and Virtue bids us use. Hail, venerable Twelve! ye Souls of Prayer! Rev'rend and holy, as you are, Be it your Province, born to claim That Care, To clear Religion's Stream, from idol Mud; And strike lost Brightness, through her troubled Flood. My humbler Duty but prepares the Way: And bows th'awak'ning People, to your Sway. Already, to my Care, They owe, That absent Midian seeks a distant Foe. Should Tyre be Hers, 'tis, for our Safety, won: The Rich retains 'em: and the Poor, they shun. Should they miscarry, they new Pow'rs provoke: And Strength divided, by less Strength is broke. Zalmunna, Sov'reign of their haughty Host, Demands, from Ev'ry Tribe, one Chief, dispatch'd Envoys, for Israel's Peace, to Sidon's Coast: Now, be this fair Occasion aptly snatch'd! Lend, holy Twelve! lend, All your rev'rend Weight: From your respective Chiefs, commission'd, fly; Th'united Representers of our State: And shine and prosper, in th'Insulter's Eye. Alliance granted, we are free:—deny'd, Be it my Task, in Arms, to check their Pride. But, to wish'd Peace while All our Hopes are led, Wisely fore-arm'd, your martial Influence, try: And draw th'array'd Allotments to a Head. Known, tho' neglectful, These can promptly move: And our old Force of warlike Order prove. Nam'd, and enroll'd, Each comes, when Summons goes:— Rous'd, by the fav'ring Absence of the Foes, These, to Conjunction, urge, on Ophra's Hill. Send 'em, unexercis'd: the active Will Soon disciplines Obedience, into Skill. Some Tribes, remote, too slowly, may appear: Nor, timely, join our hast'ning Standard, here. But Zebulon, and Asher, bord'ring, lie: Napthalia's Tract not far remov'd: the Manasæan, nigh. You, sacred Seers, from Those four Districts sent! Remind your Princes, that our first Alarms, Should they, from Tyre, call back the Midian Arms, Bring through their Bosom, the revengeful Foe: Thence, must Their Safety, from their Courage, flow. That weigh'd Reflection wings their needful Speed: And, since To-morrow's Dawn may greet you, there, And heav'n-commission'd Wishes soon succeed, These, who shall find War's Every Nerve supply'd, From Stores, my previous Care shall, here, provide, Might with so swift Advance, for March prepare, That, on the fifth revolving Day, They may their Ensigns, on these Hills, display. Press their Departure, whose first Aid we need: For, soon as Midian learns that Israel arms, She may, perhaps, from Tyre's touch'd Wall, recede: To blast our Purpose, with returning Swarms. Now, rip'ning Harvest smiles on ev'ry Plain; To heap our Magazines, with needful Grain. Foes have, 'tis true, our ablest Horse destroy'd: But War's chief Strength is Foot, not ill employ'd. Next,—would my Father's Will indulge my Pray'r, He, to this Hope, would lend his missive Care: He, first, to Oreb, Midian's noblest King, Should bear, precautious, this credential Ring. Say, when His hospitable Eye, your welcome Presence meets, Gideon, oblig'd, the Royal Giver, greets: Greets him, with Claim of promis'd Friendship due, Say, Ophra's Gen'ral—and add, Israel's, too: Does, with new Levies, His known Wish pursue. Tell him, to war on Tyre, as Midian's Friend, We, for joint Use, fraternal Strength, extend. Add, that Twelve Legates, hence, commission'd, go: To sign form'd Contract, 'gainst our Common Foe. XXXI. He ceas'd: and joyful Wonder, and Applause, Concurr'd, in Rapture of avow'd Consent: Faith, from His Measures, bright'ning Prospect, draws; And, to pale Doubt, enliv'ning Comfort, lent. The Senate rose; on sep'rate Charges, bent: The People, as they pass, transported shout. And Ophra's echoing Domes resound: and Triumph reigns, throughout. ELEGY by DAVID: For the Death of Saul and Jonathan. (2 Kings, Chap. i.) Taken from Notes and Miscellaneous Reflections on the First Book. I O, Israel! how does all thy Beauty fade! How are the Mighty fall'n! the Strong betray'd! Ne'er may this Woe in Gath's full Streets be told: Never, let Ascalon our Fate unfold. II Mountains of Gilboa! may ye drink no Dew! Let Rain's mourn'd Want turn red your verdant Hue! Let your Vines wither, and your Olives die: And your parch'd Fields no grainy Wealth supply. For, there, abandon'd Saul, brave Monarch! bled: As if no awful Oil had hemm'd his Head. III Never, in vain, drew Jonathan his Bow, Never Saul's Sword fell, frustrate, on a Foe: Lovely, and loving! one dear Life they led: Nor parted, dying, but together bled. Swifter than Eagles, to the Fight they flew, Stronger than Lions, they could Foes pursue. IV Daughters of Israel! weep the Loss of Saul: In Scarlet, and in Gold, he cloth'd you All. Peaceful, beneath his warlike Shade, you smil'd: And triumph'd by Their Toil, whose Hosts he spoil'd. V Thee, Jonathan, my Brother! Thee I mourn, With Grief still growing must thy Loss be borne! Soft, and delightful Partner, of my Soul! Two Halfs, divided, made us one dear Whole. Vast was Thy Love, and wonderful, to me: And never Woman lov'd, as I lov'd Thee.</field>
