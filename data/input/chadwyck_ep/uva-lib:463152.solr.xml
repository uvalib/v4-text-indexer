[Not to extoll your beautie, or sett forth] Not to extoll your beautie, or sett forth your plenteous graces, and your vertues woorth my yonge Muse dares attempt: such higher skill belonges vnto a farr more learned qwill: I only in humble layes endevor here to tell the loue I beare to you (my deare) and to perswade therin your sweet consent; “so farr affection makes me eloquent; you knowe your owne desert; I need not tell it: you knowe my loue; I cannot then conceale it. When first vnto your all-comandinge eyes I offred vp my self a sacrifice, and in the inchantment of your sugred smyle did myne owne sowle of liberty begwyle: I found my self to barren of desert, which to supply, I vow'd a constant heart shold ever honor you with all respects; “perfect goodwill makes perfect all defects: this totall summe I tendred then to you, and still you haue it; (for it is your due) and still shall haue it whiles I liue; vnles smooth-slydinge Thamisis haue back regresse, from louely London, to the learned Towne: or that the loftiest English mountayns crowne be lowe avayled to a vally deepe. But what avayles me that my vowes I keepe? yf (as of late) you study to neglect, and doe despise my dutyfull respect. I must confesse your liberall grace to me, outstript my merit; and did make me see my self a debtor in my best habilitie. But wherof shold arise your mutabilitie? yf of my self; ô lett me see wherin, that I may dy for pennance of that sinne; But yf of you; I thinke it wondrous strange, so choyce a beauty shold delight in change: the purest colour is a perfect one; if it be mixt the beauty then is gone: the lightest, bryghtest, tincture (well you wott) paynted on whyte, appeares but as a spott. But not of me, nor of your self (I knowe) this sad dislike of late beginnes to growe, But of an envie that from my good speed, into an others base sowle doth proceede: your mayde I meane; she (haply) doth invade you, and with her sluttish reasons wold perswade you, to change your mynd; yet you I knowe are wise, to sift such malice out of false disguyse: and neede not feare so vile a thinge as she a blemish in your high repute can bee; for yf you did you might prevent the ill; “the absent eare will cause the tongue be still; “the absent eye keepes knowledge from the mynd; “she'es chast, that's chary; all the world is blynde “in sable shadow of the silent night; “all things discerned in the blabbinge light. Is not your mayd (I pray) at your dispose? you neede not doubt: for hence the comfort growes, that when you please she must haue winges to fly; “the cause remou'd th'effect of force must dye. my Deare, your wisdome must your self direct, to stopp fames mouth, and blynd the worlds suspect. which in my Iudgement you can never doe, as longe as such vile drosse shall censure you; But vnto you I wholy do remitte the sight herof, and what herin is fitt. Your once, instantly, ever, J. S. [Of late I went my dearest deare to trie her]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Of late I went my dearest deare to trie her, And found her sleeping, &amp; then began to woe her, And safelie stouping gentlie laid me by her And still my mistress slept, but did not sleepe, And then I tought my wanton eye to gaze one head, on face, one feet, on legges on thighe where sweet delight remaines, I sawe the place and still my mistress sawe, but wold not see And then I tought my toung to blaze my paine and softlie whispering tould her in her eare both of my loue and of her proud disdaine and still my mistress hard but would not heare Then I tought mine armes her neck to foulde and of a gentle kisse did her beguile Soe kist and kist till kissing made me bould and still my mistress smilde but wold not smile And then I tought my Idle fingers woe each comelie parte from head vnto the heele where Cupid holdes his campe I touched toe and still my mistress felt, but wold not feele And then I tought my man to wantonnise And in the boate of true delight to Roe of true delights, not Idle fantasies And still my mistress did, but wold not doe But since she slepte &amp; smilde &amp; felt and did in deed I wish I might be oftner soe beguild Thoughe not in shoue The substaunce I effect let shadowes goe. Finis. [Bewties delite geve place to this fayer starr] The initial letter of each of the first ten lines of this poem is emboldened, to spell Blanch Wynn. Bewties delite geve place to this fayer starr loocke still one her, hur eyes will geve yow light Ammiabel she is hur lovely fame goes farre number her vertues and behould her sight Compare her then to any that is livinge hur bewety with ther bewty wilbe strivinge wine colored cheke tournd to a cherye red yeldes comfort to the eye that doth behould her natur with hvr sweet bewty now is fedd note but hur lyvely partes when you vnfould hur And yow will saye that Venus shoud her coninge And in hur face trve bewty sate a-soninge Finis.

A Conceite. ffowle pried it self breeds envy long And is A poyson fresh and strong And by experience it is knowne To be as marrow in the bone And those that grow of sundry seeds At last do proue but stinking weeds And if pure wheat be sowde in tares The wheat Assuredly it mars. finis John Salusbury. A Concete to the former. A base bread haggard that my chaunce doth light with the Imperious eagle in her flight and gainst all nature in her nest doth breed and with the eagles food his yong ons feed: shall this great grace alter the buzards mind, I it must be for kitt will after kind; havinge no name but given by the nurse in basenes borne and now by basenes worse for having stole A name from gentry, pried is his coate by lawfull heraldrie base hawtie pried did soe his kindred blott, that in this fortune he himselfe forgott: but Joues great bird doth laffe this kight to scorne to se how priede his basenes had oerborne and pluck his winges he shall not mount so highe but fall into the cave of beggarye. finis J. S. [Faith needs noe foile; foiles helpe where faith doth neede]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Faith needs noe foile; foiles helpe where faith doth neede Pure white can grace it self self grace is best What perfect is by aide wantes of perfection for aide bewraies a want in that which needs it and faith in words is a bare affection as fire which is but fire when fuell feeds it, yet most hould words and showes true meaninges measure then faile I of meede since words faile me but hold my faith sweet Sainct like hidden treasure which is more ritch vnseene then what yow see Soe is my faith but gracd, thoughe none haue knowne it yf yow to whom I owe my faith will owne it. Finis q?/ Certaine Necessary obseruations For Health Jo. Salusbury 1603 Eschewe lewde lust yf thou be wise, hote spice and wines forbeare: Fly su[r]feit, riot and excesse, and eke long sweating here. Rawe frutes thy stomacke will annoy: beware of drinking late: Long watching with disordred hours, will soone impaire thy state. Impatience is noe frend to health, a fretting irefull moode: Will stirre the vaines and hurt the braine, and soone infect the bloode. Eate seldome of the salt and sower, the windy rootes eschewe: The lemon and the coucumber will make thy stomack rewe. The bale and bane of eies and sight is venus winde and fyre: Oft looking downe doth hurt them much, cold water they desire. To rubb, to combe, to stretch the armes, yf fasting that thou bee: To body, head, and spleene also, are holesome thinges for thee. Noone sleepes, much slouth, and sitting still, what breed they els but wo: Who euer saw a slouthfull man a healthfull body shewe. To ache, to goute, to stone, to reume, to palsey, pyles and all: A lazie body by desert is subiect and most thrall. Vse exercise then in measure and meane, yf sound thou wilt be still: But after sweat beware of cold, for that will breede much ill. Ware how thou sit or lie on ground, for that thy ioynts will lame: The body drawes soone from the earth, that will corupt the same. The early morning mountaine walkes, and eke the runing streames: Refresh the wearied spirits of man, when Phebus shews his beames. But ware at night when dewe is fallen, and sunne by course is set: The noysome ayre ere thou beware, will soone thy corps infect. Apohecaries shop of drugges let not thy stomack be: Nor vse noe phisick till thou neede, thy frende aduiseth thee. Let seldome blood but when disease, or plurisies doo call: But after fiftie yeares be past, ware bleed thou not at all Obserue these rules and lessons well, keep neck and feete from cold: So mayst thou liue by natures course, till yeares haue made thee old. J. S. his amasement. Griefe is the sea that ouerflowes my hart, Droun'de by my thoughts, that doe procure my smart, My thoughts, and griefes be waywarde Dearest Deare, Because I misse thee, when I wish thee neare/ And that I rest vppon thy auntient Loue, Which chainge of time, nor absense cannot moue, But all thy thoughts of me (I feare) are flowne, Because thow think'st I holde thee not mine owne/ Or else thy hart, and thoughts, wolde breake with paine, To think vppon the griefe that I sustaine/ Being such, as bearing in my trobled brest. Olde auntient Loue: Nue griefes will neuer rest. For thee my trust, my Life, my hart, my restles ioy Is knowne, is pawn'd, is trobled with annoy. Compare the cause of my much strainge estate/ And thow wil'te thinke I am vnfortunate. And yt wolde make thy womanish breast to bleede, With sobbs of sorowe, from fowle griefe not freede, Which I in honest Loue will rather hide, Then thow for me impatience sholdst abide/ And still be hardly thought of, and endure Such plurall death of minde, which you procure/ Rather then you shall once your finger moue, Or cause to ake: I will conceale my Loue: Vntill the time my thoughts, and cares be free/ I cannot rest (my Sweet) but thinke on thee/ I wolde not wish my griefe (my Loue) be knowne, Nor in the popular opemouth'de worlde be blowne/ That is the cause that makes my cariadge strainge To thee thow think'st: and yet mine eye doth rainge Sparcling out Loue fires, on thy Lillie brest Wheare Philvmela builds her softe-down'de nest. That auntient Loue to thee I haue profest. Makes thee to thinke I hate thee with the rest. Thoughe still I dote: and wolde not haue thee knowe yt Till time, and place, doe serue for me to showe yt, My head, my hart, mine eyes, my Lippes, my tounge, Shall medytate thy praise, and singe a songe, Of neuer dyinge Loue: set to the Lute By great Apollo, making Venvs mute, As blussing, for to heare thy bewties glorrie, And vertues to bedecke my happy storye; Sleeping, or waking, going, or sittinge still, Seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, speaking, shall fulfill, And with this Concordant Pilgrim must agree Vntill the time that thoughts and I be free All dismall death, all plunging plagues, all greeuous grones, All gulphes of griefe, all woes, and piteous mones, All anguish, and what else procureth paine For thee I feele, and euer shall sustaine All pleasures, pastimes, mirth, and luckye ioyes All happy howres, and euer blessed daies, Are gone, are fled, are vaded and are spente, Vnlesse thy Crimson-colored hart relent; And that my happes, my future hopes fulfill, My hopes by happes mischaunce my hart will kill. Soe hopes, and happes, and all shalbe deceaued, Vnlesse by thee my sweete they be releaued./ ????? J. S. [Delite doth nessell in her comelie face] The initial letter of each of the first fifteen lines of this poem is emboldened, to spell Dorothie Halsall. Delite doth nessell in her comelie face On heade or heare like radiant Phebus strange Radiant eies that light the darkest place O heavenlie eies such heare Evaddna twynes Two Cheris fel in beaten swgwr white Her cheekes of them the coller do reserve In her sweete lippes; the taste of them are sweete Eternall praise, fayer Cheekes sweet lippes deserve Her naked necke as white as silver swanne As silver swanne or rarest lilie flowre Let silver byrd or lily flower wax wan Such white is hers as ever shall endure Appelles payntinge venus face and breaste Lefte the other partes impolisd without arte Lord all the world canot expresse the rest of this sweete wighte sole solace of my harte finis J.

      <field name="fulltext">Poems by Sir John Salusbury THE Patrone his pathetical Posies, Sonets, Maddrigalls, &amp; Rowndelayes. Together With Sinetes Dompe Plena verecun di culpa pu doris erat. Poesie I. The patrones conceyte: The initial letter of each of the first seven stanzas and of each line of the eighth stanza is emboldened, to spell Dorothy Halsal. Domesticke Goddes of the Sea-whal'd Isle, Heau'ns erected trophies of thy prayes, Avroras blush, that beautifies thy smile, Shines far more bright then Phœbus goulden rayes, Natures chiefe pride, the map of beauties grace, Loues louely sweete, which vertue doth embrace. Of-spring of fludds, borne of the salt-sea foame, Thoughts-maze that doth to Pallas bower inclines A Commet, that in starrie night doth gloame. And doth presage of misteries diuine? An ornament, bedeck'd with goulden tyres, A pearle in camp'd in strength of chaste desires. Reposed rest of Adon's ardent looke. Thy Christall-pointed eies (like Saphyres blue, Set in the snowe) doe hide a bayted hooke: Which doth intrap by force of Goulden hue: Were Adon here to viewe thy Venvs eye Could Adon such a Venvs suite denye. Olympus Queene, that doth commaunde the skyes, Whose shining beam's doe light the westerne Isle, No base aspect in thy sweete bodie lies, Thy fauours doe the stealing time beguile: For precious breath so doth perfume the ayre, That all applaude thou onl art sweete and faire. The Radian beam's of natur's purest die, With honours Equipage long liue thy fame, Whose siluer arkes, surpassing Christall skie, Doth force loue Queene to reuerence thy name: Starrs doe inuay, that earth retaineth thee, From making Fourth amongst the graces Three. Heau'ns newe ioy, earth's possessed wonder, The welkins pride, if they might thee embraece, As they did Ioves loue that kills with thunder, Thy memorie her beautie doth deface. Liue long thou star, which in the North doth shine, That noble worth's may fill thy sacred shrine. Ympe graft with vertue in her tender yeeres, Deriuing honour from her noble stocke, Which Needles weare? for honour still appeer's Within her browe, which doth fames cradle rocke; Whose searching wit, dipt in Minervas vaine, Fraught with content, doth Pallas prayses staine. Hibbla hath Bees, stor'd with a sweete encrease, And shee hath beautie, furnished with grace, Liue stinges doe pricke, though hony's taste to please, So woundes her beautie those which it embrace: A Lampe of glorie shines in thee alone, Liue long in earth thou match-lesse Paragone. Posie II. The Patrone's affection. The initial letter of each line is emboldened, to spell Dorothy Halsall. Launterne of loue the patrone due of lore, Light some beame my affection to guide, Amongst the drerie throbbes encreasing sore, Sore in the vaile of heart where I them hide: Languishing in delight I doe delight to pine And can I pine a more contented paine, Hart once mine-owne, is nowe possession thine, Yeilde then to yeilde this hearts due entertaine. Honour is the guest, let bounty be my prize, Truth be the page of my admired light, Occasion be thou prest at my aduize, Regarding hand, and hart, t'attend her sight. Or else my heart and minde I hould in hand: Doe then my hope confirme that hope may stand. Posie III. The patrones phantasie. The initial letter of each line and other letters are emboldened, to spell Dorothy Halsall Cvtbert IS. Tormented heart in thrall, Yea thrall to loue, Respecting will, Heart-breaking gaine doth grow, Euer Dolobelia, Time so will proue, Binding distresse, O gem wilt thou allowe, This fortune my will Repose-lesse of ease, Vnlesse thou Leda, Ouer-spread my heart, Cutting all my ruth, dayne Disdaine to cease, I yeilde to fate, and welcome endles Smart. Posie IIII. The Patrons pauze in ode. The initial letter of the first line of each stanza is emboldened, to spell Dorothi Halsall; the initial letter of the second line of each stanza is enlarged, to spell Fransis Wilowbi; the initial letter of each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth lines of each of the first eight stanzas is printed in gothic form, to spell Elizabeth Wolfrestone Robert Parrye; the initial letter of the final line of each stanza is emboldened, to spell Iohn Salesbvrye. Dimpl's florish, beauties grace, Fortune smileth in thy face, Eye bewrayeth honours flower, Loue is norish'd in thy bower, In thy bended brow doth lye, Zeale imprest with chastitie. Iove's darling deere, O pale lippes of corall hue, Rarer die then cheries newe, Arkes where reason cannot trie, Beauties riches which doth lye, Entomb'd in that fayrest frame, Touch of breath perfumes the same. O rubie cleere. Ripe Adon fled Venvs bower, Ayming at thy sweetest flower, His ardent loue forst the same, Wonted agents of his flame: Orbe to whose enflamed fier, Loue incens'd him to aspire. Hope of our time, Oriad's of the hills drawe neere, Nayad's come before your peere: Flower of nature shining shoes, Riper then the falling rose, Entermingled with white flower, Stayn'd with vermilion's power. Nestl'd in our clime. The siluer swans sing in poe, Silent notes of newe-spronge woe, Tuned notes of cares I sing, Organ of the muses springe, Natures pride inforceth me, Eu'n to rue my destinie. Starre shew thy might, Helens beautie is defac'd, I o's graces are disgrac'd, Reaching not the twentith part, Of thy gloases true desart, But no maruaile thou alone, Eu'n art Venys paragone, Arm'd with delight. Iris coulors are to base, She would make Apelles gaze, Resting by the siluer streame, Tossing nature seame by seame, Pointing at the Christall skie, Arguing her maiestie, Loues rampire stronge Hayre of Amber, fresh of hue, Wau'd with goulden wyers newe, Riches of the finest mould, Rarest glorie to behould, Ympe with natures vertue graft, Engines newe for dolors fraught Eu'n there are spronge, A Iem fram'd with Diamounds, In whose voice true concord sounds, Ioy to all that ken thy smile, In thee doth vertue fame beguile, In whose beautie burneth fier, Which disgraceth Queene desier: Saunce all compare, Loue it selfe being brought to gaze, Learnes to treade the louers maze; Lying vncou'red in thy looke, Left for to vnclaspe the Booke: Where enroul'd thy fame remaines, That Ivnos blush of glory staines: Blot out my care. Spheare containing all in all, Onely fram'd to make men thrall: Onix deck'd with honours worth, On whose beautie bringeth foorth: Smiles ou'r clouded with disdaine, Which loyall heart doth paine: Voyde of disgrace, Avrora's blush that decks thy smile, Wayting louers to beguile: Where curious thoughts built the nest, Which neu'r yeildes to louers rest: Wasting still the yeilding eye, Whilst he doth the beautie spie Rea'd in her face. Lampe enric'hd with honours flower, Blossome gracing Venvs bower: Bearing plumes of feathers white, Wherein Turtles doe delighte, Sense would seme to weake to finde, Reason's depth in modest minde: Yeilding desire. Lode-starre of my happie choyse, In thee alone I doe reioyce: O happie man whose hap is such, To be made happie by thy tutch: Thy worth and worthynes could moue The stoutest to incline to loue, Enflam'd with fier. Posie V. The dittie to Sospiros. The wound of hart doth cause my sighes to spring And sighes doe oft report my hartie sore, This sore of heart doth woefull tidings bring, That loue is lacke and I doe grieue therefore: O sighes why doe you rise and take no rest, O heart why art thou thus with them possest. My heart in selfe it selfe would pine away, if that sometimes sighes musicke I shoulde misse, This bitter ioy and pleasant paine must staie, The greatest griefe is now my greatest blisse: The night I grone the day I teare my heart, I loue these sighes I triumph in their smart. When minde and thought are clogged with their cares And that my heart is readie for to breake, Then eu'rie sigh doth question how it fares, And heart to them replies that it is weake. er after sighes the heart is some-what glad, us without sower the sweete is neuer had. My wish and will for succour doe aspire, Vnto the seate of my endeered trust, But want and woe ensuing my desire, My heart doth quaile and after sigh it must: Yet wish I must and well I may delight, Though sighe for wants and woes doe me affright. These sighes Ile entertaine though they me noy, For they doe like the cause from where they rise, They bring in port newes of my mynded ioy, And as they passe they message me no lies: And yet they leaue behinde them such a want, That minde and ioy I finde to be but scant, O will you neuer cease me sighes to grieue, And maye not hope keepe you in calme repose, Let me some respite haue, hart to relieue, Lest that your selues and you fullie lose: Sighes doe aspire till they obtaine their will, Sighes will not cease they seeke my heart to kill. Posie 6. The patrones Dilemma. Some letters in this poem are emboldened, to spell Dorothy Halsal. Of stately stones the Diamond is kinge, Whose splendor doth dazell the gazing eye, The Onix gloze, is tyed to honors winge, Whose vertu's gouern'd by th'imperiall skie: These graces all in thee combin'd remaine, For glorie thine their glories still doth staine. Shall I not speake of Rubies glorious blaze, That I blazeth still, like blazing star that shoes, Or cease to write how men at th'Opale gaze, Whose beautie shines like perles of dewe on rose: These vertues all (compar'd with thine) are base, For nature gaue thee excellent of grace. The Topas chast thou doest in kind excell, The Hyacinth that strangers loue procures, Hath not such force, nor can not worke so well, As honors beautie still in thee alures; Yris shews not more coulors in her kind, Then vertues be with in thy noble mind. The windie Histmos shews, and bright aspects, Comes far behind this faire Angragos worth, The Lupinar hath not more chast affects. Then glorie of th'vnspotted minde brings foorth. My paines encrease thy graces to repeate, For cold despaire driues out of hope the heate. Yf Saunus fort which doth expell deceate, Or Agathes which happie bouldnes yeild's, And eke Luperius whose vertues greate, Doth glad the minde: all which are found in feilds: Yf these I had to comfort my despaire, Hope yet might hope to win &amp; weare thy faire. Posie. VII. The Palmers Dittie vppon his Almes. Favre Dole the flower of beawties glorious shine, Whose sweete sweet grace true guerdon doth deserue, My Orisons I offer to thy shrine, That beauties name in glories state preserue: My hap (ô haplesse hap) that gaue th'applause, Thy beautie view'd when trembling hart did pause. Were I a King, I would resigne my Crowne, To gaine the name of Palmers happie kinde, I would not craue to liue in high renowne, If Dole I had to satisfie my minde: Then I for Dole a Palmers name would craue, If Palmer might be sure his dole to haue. Posie. VIII. The Patrones Adiew. The initial letter of each line and other letters are emboldened, to spell Dorothy Halsall IS. Yf loue deserues the fruit of loues desire, Hope loathes my loue to liue in hope of right: Time after triall once may quench my fire, Oh salue the sore and cherish my delight: Rue lawles force, which feruent zeale procures. Obtaine a hart like to the Emerauld pure: Dayne hope to graunt where feare dispaire allures, In deepe distresse naught but true faith is sure. Poesie IX. Fides in Fortunam. Most sacred is the sweete where fortune swayes, Deuine the sound of her enchaunting voice. Noe hope of rest, wher hope, true hope delayes, Though I dispaire I may not change me choise: For hue [sic] I well, though fortune me dispise, To honour her, that scornes my enterprise. To bandie lookes will ease my thrauled heart, With lookes, my life shalbe at her commaunde, Yf so much grace to faith she will impart: With lookes againe, to answere my demaunde; And that I may still loue her to my graue, With purest faith, is all that I doe craue. Let Phœbus drawe his shining beam's away, Let heau'ns forsake to graunt me any light, Let foode me faile; let hope, my hope delay; Let eares not heare; let watch-full eies want sight: Let sense, my sense, with furies fell confound, Before that faith, to fortune false be found. Thy eu'r sworne friende, and seruant to thy end, Hath made a vowe and promise with his soule. His fortun's right with courage to defend, Against proudest he, this offer dare controle: My match is sure if Fortune grace her swayne, And coulors giue her quarrell to maintaine. Colours they are of purest Indian die, For none but such doth Fortune vse to lend. Whose sight may moue the coward neu'r to flie, And all his force against his foe to bend. Then let sweet soule thy colours be my guide, And hap what maye, thy doome I will abide. Then write thy Censure with thy prettie hand, I will obay the sentence of thy minde, And graue the same in table faire to stand; So that, ensuing age the same may finde: For monument in goulden letters wrought, To whet with sight the accents of my thought. Poesie X. My sorrow is ioy. Sowre is the sweet that sorrow doth mainetaine, Yet sorrow's good, that yeildeth mickle ioy, True ioy he hath, that can from ioy refrayne. Which haruest's still the fruites of deepe annoy: Yet I enthraulde in blind Cvpidos snare, With fond conceyte in sorrows ioy I faire. Fortun's my ioy, which sorrow still doth yeild, Her frowne I count a fauour to my soule; Sorrow doth sway, and ioy hath lost the field, Yet fame in minde doth often ioy enro'le: But when I thinke for whom I beare this smart, It yeilds new ioy vnto my carefull hart. Poesie. XI. An almon for a Parrat. Disdainfull dames that mountaines moue in thought, And thinke they may Ioues thunder-bolt controule, Who past compare ech one doe set at naught, With spuemish scorn's that nowe in rethorick roule: Yet scorne that will be scorn'd of proude disdaine, I scorne to beare the scornes of finest braine. Gestures, nor lookes of simpring coy conceyts, Shall make me moue for stately ladies mocks: Then Sirens cease to trap with your deceyts, Least that your barkes meete vnexpected rocks: For calmest ebbe may yeild the roughest tide, And change of time, may change in time your pride. Leaue to conuerse if needes you must inuay, Let meaner sort feede on their meane entent, And soare on still, the larke is fled awaye, Some one in time will pay what you haue lent, Poore hungrie gnatts faile not on wormes to feede, When goshaukes misse on hoped pray to speede. Poesie. XII. The authors muse vpon / his Conceyte. Faire, fairest, faire; is passing faire, be faire, Let not your deed's obscure your beauties faire. The Queene so faire of Fearies not more fayer, Which doth excell with fancies chiefest fayer, Fayre to the worldes faire admiring wonder, Fayrer then Ioves loue that kills with thunder. Eu'n to your swayne you seeme prides passing faire, That naught desires but fortun's faire to reape, Yf fortune then will driue me to despaire, No change can make your sweetest faire so cheape, But that I must, and will liue in exile, Before your thoughtes with thought I will defile. Fayre fierce to faith, when fortune bend her browes, Yet fortune sweete be thou reclaym'd againe: For vnto thee I offer all my vowes, That may appease the rigor of my paine: Yeilde wished hope after this stormie blast, That calm's repose may worke content at last. Posie. 13. Fides ad fortunam. The goulden Phebus (longing oft) is seene, To pricke his furious steedes to run in haste, To clip and coll faire Thetis louely Queene, In pensiue thoughts lest he the time should waste, So I make speede thy selfe for to embrace, Beinge almost tyr'd in pursuite of the chase. For houndes vncoupled, range the forrest wide, The stance being prun'd, I watch the rowsed game, And to the marke my shaftes full well I guide: The craftie Doo takes on then to be lame: But hauing past the daunger of my bowe, She, limping leaues, and hastes away to goe. Thus I being surest of my hoped sport, Still misse the fairest marke that eu'r was kend, Words doe abound of comfort to exhorte, But deedes are slowe sure promises to end: The hope then left is game to rowse anewe, (Till deedes supplie) and feede my selfe with view. Fortune hath sayde, and I beleeued that, Renewed hope might ease my heart neere spent: Despaire in sequel oft my hope doth squat; That doubtfull I remaine still discontent, Wherefore to faith if faith remaine in thee, With faithfull wordes let deedes in one agree. FINIS. Sonetto. 1. [Reade these my lines the the carrecters of care] Reade these my lines the the carrecters of care, Sweete Nymph these lynes reade ou'r &amp; ou'r againe, View in this glasse (that glorie doth prepare,) The depth of worthes which in thee doth remaine, Heare I set foorth the garden of thy grace, With plentie stor'd of choyse and sweetest flowers, Where I for thee abortiue thoughtes embrace; When in conceyte hope lodgeth in thy bowers. Heare shalt thou finde the Orphans of my hope, Shad'wed with vaile en'n of thy rare deseart, Of all my thoughtes here shalt thou finde the scope, Which to the worlde thy honour shalt ympart. Thus will I say when skies aduaunce thy name, Liue Helens peere eternized thy fame. Sonetto. 2. [Farewell my hope thy hap did thee not steede] Farewell my hope thy hap did thee not steede, And thou my hap vnhappie come to mee, Farewell my trust which voide wast of all meede, And thou heart-sore attend my miserie, Farewell my hold which wast to stronge to hold, And thou my ruine welcome to my gaine, Farewell my life which dead are in my mould, And life no life torment my hart with paine. Farewell my chiefe that conquerst with thy looke, And thraldome I appeale to riue my heart, Farewell my thought, thy thought she will not brooke, Yet thinke I will for that I feele the smart. Farewell my choise I lastly doe thee chuse, I cannot chuse another to my will: Farewell my comfort comfortles o muse, And sorrowe weake thy wrath my ioy to spill. Farewell long stay for winde to fill thy sayle, Come banishment. Adieû, loue must preuayle. Sonetto. 3. [Emerald of treasure eternall spring] The initial letter of each line in this and the two following poems is emboldened, to spell Salvsbery Eleanor Salvsbvrye Elanor IS His Valentine. Emerald of treasure eternall spring, Nurst by the graces day-starre shine on hie, Ingendring perfect blisse with valens ring: Twisting loue and liking with constancie. Now stanchlesse hart redres &amp; soule-sick wound, Enwrap the same in foldes of fresh desire, Let loûe be waking haruest hope be found, And liuing spring to quench this flame of fier. Vnto your excellent loue sole commaund, Seing ês you may procure I me commend, Into your counsels grace voutch my demaund, Heate burning ioy sustaine in ioyfull end. So shall my mûse your name ay coronize, I will it blaze to all posterities. Sonetto. 4. [Relieûe my minde being ouerprest with care] Relieûe my minde being ouerprest with care, O heare my sorowes for I doe complaine, Non may th? help saue you the cure being rare, Ah put me not to death with lingring paine. Lest that my death to you shall nothing gaine, Enforced loûe dislikes which is not meete, Equalite of loûe doth neuer paine. You paragon most pretious pure and sweete, Reioyce your louers harte with loûe for loûe, Vnlace dislike and let be far disdaine, Both one in one and let affection mooûe: Since that in hart affection doth remaine. Vntie distresse to finde my blisfull sport, Let not your hart be cruell to the meeke, Attend my harts desire in humble sort: Soone grant my humble hart what it doth seeke. Sonetto. 5. [Retire you thoughts vnto your wonted place] Retire you thoughts vnto your wonted place, Or let your place be where your thoughts are prent, Newe ioyes approching with a kindely grace: And hope that blossoms on affections dent. Excelling worth lyeth buried in my brest, Loue eke concealing paine in tombe of heart, Each ioy is griefe wherewith thou art opprest; Yound is thy griefe but sudden old thy smart. Rich is thy choyce desire hath twise a neede, Eu'n so my hope would reape hope to sustaine, Bearing in my heart the wish of heartie deede, Sealing selfe and lore [sic] high concealed vaine. Vnspotted trust and truth ty'd to the same, Loue keeping awe is awefull trust shall prooue, Amongst the stings where heart doth feele the flame, Such is the meaning of my fixed loue, Such be her hart my dolors to remooue. Sonetto. 6. [Vppon the sandes where raging sea doth roare] Vppon the sandes where raging sea doth roare, With fearefull sound, I standing with desire, The element his billowes sendes to shoare, And takes away my ioy to my great ire. So water tho did seeke to quench my fire, Whose furie (I beheld) with rash rebound, That would surflow my life, o rage to dire, My hearts high rocke was rent which stood on ground: But high commaund retreait she made him sound, Who once immite [sic] his furie did surcease, And way-white waûes to vieû her did redound, Breaking at her sight her empire to complease, And blustring windes their forces did release, Least that their tûmult might her eares offend, And with a calmie fawne breath'd to her ease, Thus was my wish to port they should her send. So waûie seas and windes once made me sad, So waûie seas and windes haûe made me glad. Amore é mare. Sonetto. 7. [Marching in the plaine field of my conceyte] Marching in the plaine field of my conceyte, I might behold a tent which was at rest, My forces I did bend but ah deceite: There left I freedome last which is now least. For when I thought to fight with Mars for best, There Cupid was which brought me to distresse, Of foe when I thought to make a conquest, Loûe and desire in tent did me oppresse. These captaines twaine from torm?t may surcease, If they did know the lore I beare in minde, They may as Turtles one procure thy ease, O that to me of twaine one would be kinde. Thou t?t that holdst in night such turtle doûes, Reioice, embrace the twayne of world the loûes. Sonetto. 8. [Of all the bûddes that yeild to men delight] Of all the bûddes that yeild to men delight, Sweete eglantine that sentest in the aire, Art worthie pen of gold thy praise to dight: Thy flowers of bloome make world both green &amp; faire, To wearied sence thou comfort doth repaire, Thy pleasure from the eye doth neuer stray, To fancies hest thou art a stately chaire: And wounded hartes desire thou canst allay. More bright then sun thou stand'st in window bay, And to thy light the sûnne may not come neere, Thou lasting flower doth euerlasting stay: O that within thy flowers I might appeare. As I did passe sweete sent to hart did clime, O thou sweete branch the sweetnes of my time. Sonetto. 9. [As eye bewrayeth the secretes of my minde] As eye bewrayeth the secretes of my minde, I did regard an Eglantine most faire, That sprong in sight of sun that brightly shind, And yet no sunne her springing could empayre. I did reioyce to come within her aire, Her sweetenes to receiue within my brest: O that her sent in hart ay might I weare, With griping griefe heart should not be opprest. Heart panting sore would cease or take some rest, And feare disloyall vanish would away, Then ouer griefe in triumph were I blest, To be reuiued when life went to decay, With shadow hide me from these hart-breake showers, And with thy sent refresh me in thy bowers. Sonetto. 10. [The onely helpe that some distressed haûe] The onely helpe that some distressed haûe, To keepe the life though lingring in the paine, Is that a time some place will find to saue, The losse of heart procured by disdaine. Nowe place is faire yet hope I doe retaine, That distance neuer altereth the minde, The height of hills doth make the lowly plaine, The rising sunne in skie feares not the winde: And yet I see place is somewhat vnkinde, To offer me the lack of her sweete face, Which cannot solac'd be till I it find: To free my heart and loûe of loûes disgrace, O place if thou didst take her from my eye, Bring her in place where place may remedie. Sonetto. 11. [When chirping byrds did chaunt their musickes layes] When chirping byrds did chaunt their musickes layes, For to salute Dame Flora with her traine, And vesta cloth'd with chaung of fresh arayes, For to adorn Hopes happie entertayne: Then sweetest Briere that shylded our repose, Sent odours sweete, from her fresh hanging bowes, And Philomel oft-changed notes did close, Which did accorde eu'n with our hallow'd vowes. But then; ah then, our discontent began, A barking Dog step'd foorth with scolding rage, And Musick chang'd to notes of singing Swanne, That March wee must with swiftest Equipage. Loose not sweete bird thy voice, nor brier thy s?t. Wee'le meete againe when fortunes frownes be spent. Sonetto. 12. [Liue long sweet byrde, that to encrease our ioy] Liue long sweet byrde, that to encrease our ioy, Made soleme pause, between thy chirping layes, When stately brier shilded our anoye, And sheltred vs from peeping Phebus rayes: Sweet Philomel recorde not our delightes, In Musick's sounde, but to the subtill ayre; Least any should participate our spites, Wrought by a sudden Cerberus repayre. The pleasing sound our spirites did reuiue, The sweet, sweet sent, refresh'd our yeilding sence, The happy toutch, most to delight did striue, But caytiffe dog did hynder our pretence. Then happie Byrd farewell, that eas'd my paine, Farewell sweet brier, till fortune smile againe. Sonetto. 13. [When Lordlin Tytan lodged in the west] When Lordlin Tytan lodged in the west, And Ebon darknes ou'r-swayde the light, Latonas beams decreasing were supprest, When silent streames did murmur there delight. Then I entrench'd neere to a noble marke, With courage bould a speare I tooke in hand, To wyn my will fired with honours sparke, Or loose my life in my commaunders band. My speare I broke vpon my gentle foe, Which being perform'd the second I did charge, But honours force would not be quailed so: The third I tooke my thoughts for to enlarge; Then call'd I was for treason armes to take, And wisedome would my former charge forsake. Sonetto. 14. [Should feare pale feare me forgoe my minde] Should feare pale feare me forgoe my minde, Or legions of monsters make me quaile, No, no, I was not borne of so base kinde, As dreadfull sighes would make my heart to faile. Yet care commaund that honors my conceyte, Made me forsake what my desire embrac'd, And loth I was that riualls should repeate: My armes should be by humane force vnlac'd, Which made me yielde vnto the tyms restraynt, And leaue the charge of that most noble fight, Where kindnes more then force could make me faint, To shild my fame from fortunes cancred spite. Thus I did charge, thus I discharg'd my launce, And so I rest contented with my chaunce. Sonetto. 15. [As fond conceyt doth moue the wauering minde] As fond conceyt doth moue the wauering minde, Of artlesse sottes that knowe not wisedoms lore, Inconstant still to chang with eu'rie winde, Whose base desires want fruites of vertues store. So doth the arte and knowledge of the wise, Stirre vp his minde in honors foorde to wade, With feruent zeale base changlinges to dispise, And their weake strength, with courage to inuade, Whose mind being arm'd with true loues strong defence, He gyrdes his loynes with bondes of constancie, And scornes that ought should alter his pretence, Or stayne his name, with blot of infamie. Thus wisedome is not giuen to manye, And but to such for to be constant anye. Sonetto. 16. [Neu'r-resting chariot of the firie god] The initial letter of each line in this and the two following poems is emboldened, to spell in each case Helena Owen. Neu'r-resting chariot of the firie god, Embost'd with beames of his eternall light, Waytes at her beck when she but shakes her rod Of her commaund; who is the heau'ns delight: Avroras shine doth blush to see her grace, Nymphes gather flowers to make her chaplets fine, Engendered griefe my hoped fauour deface, Loue hates to liue when longing makes it pine: Euen so her faire makes longing deere to me, Helen the faire was not so faire as she. Sonetto. 17. [No care so great nor thoughts so pining seeme] No care so great nor thoughts so pining seeme, Enioying hope to reape the hearts desire: Which makes me more your beauties grace esteeme, Opprest with heate of Paphos holy fier. Appoint some place to ease my thrauled minde, Not freed yet from thy late luring looke; Enioye thy time and solace shalt thou finde, Let Vvlcan toyle to forge his bayted hooke: Eyes glorious glaunce will trayne him to the lure, Heau'ns do repine thou shouldst his frownes endure. Sonetto. 18. [Namelesse the flower that workes my discontent] Namelesse the flower that workes my discontent, Endlesse the cares for her I doe sustaine, Waste is the soyle which shadowes my content Once lende a salue to cure my curelesse paine. Ah deere, how deere I purchase my delight? Not longe when first I view'd thy sweetest fayre. Except thy beauty lend my darknes light, Long shall that looke my heauie lookes ympayre; Esteeme of him that liues to honour thee, Hopes true repose shall then be lodg'd in mee. Sonetto. 19. [No sooner I had thy beautie espied] No sooner I had thy beautie espied, Cleane washed from the dreggs of vices stayne, But heart to thee with constant loue was tyed; And thou perhapps wilt yeilde me but disdayne. Yf thou wilst not my loue with loue requite, I shall weare out in paine my dismall dayes, But if thy heart once harbour my delight; Then shall I liue thy heart to loue and praise. Yeilde thy consent to cure my fatall wounde, And let desert preuaile to gayne thy grace, So secret truth shall eu'r in me abounde; Yf we may meete in some conuenient place; And then be sure his name I will deface, That should be seene to speake in thy disgrace. Sonetto. 20. [Campaspe's fayre fresh-paynted forme embrac'd] Campaspe's fayre fresh-paynted forme embrac'd, By the rare Father of the paynters art, Could yeilde small ioy except that she had grac'd, His liuely cunning by her good desart, Yet he reioyc'd her counterfeyte to kisse. Which she neu'r sawe though he the same profan'd. How infinite is then my ioyfull blisse, That still enioy the Idea of thy hande; Thy gloue it is mine onlye comfort left, Which thy sweete hande made happie with her touch, This is the Idole that my heart infeoft, With loues sweete hope which I adore to much. That I retayne a monument for thee, Though without life; life it affordes to me. Sonetto. 21. [Sweete ladie I loue, by stelth my loue doth creepe] Sweete ladie I loue, by stelth my loue doth creepe, Vnto the depth of my profounde conceytes, Not daring when I wake I dreame a sleepe, Thus stealing loue by inward signes entreate: Though merrie gale bydes anchor vp to waye, And canuas store swells with a puffing blaste, Yet feare of storme doth make vs keepe the baye, For he is safe that sitts on shoare at laste: So loue embrac'd when others presence fear'd, Makes sweete proue sower wh? shadowes substance seeme. And Mars himself when Vulcans net he tear'd: Doth witnes feare doth stolen loue redeeme. When sweete repose doth calme the troubled minde, Feare of suspect doth leaue his sting behinde. Sonetto. 22. [My heart enthraul'd with mine owne desire] My heart enthraul'd with mine owne desire, Makes me to be, more then I dare to seeme, For ielosie may kindle enuies fire, To hazard that which strength cannot redeeme: The fayrest rose, on statelyest stalke that growes, Drawes a delight his odours sweete to smell, Whose pricke sometime doth sting at later close, Which makes suspect the wished sent t'expell. Loue prickes my minde to gather fayrest flowers, And feare forbids lest garden-keeper spie, Whose ielosie raines downe vntimely showres, And Argos-like doth loues repose discrie. Thus doth thy fayre my secret glaunce detect, For ielosie doth dayly breede suspect. Sonetto. 23. [When sweete repose in loues fayre bower doth rest] When sweete repose in loues fayre bower doth rest, Enchamp'd with vaile of an vnfain'd desire, Then carefull thoughtes the fearefull mindes inuest, Lest Argvs should espie the kindled fire: For where the dicte of such as may commaunde, Forbidds the same, which louers must embrace, There feare, and care, together doe demaund; Account of thinges which honour may deface: So is their ioyes with fearefull passions mixt, Which doth encrease the ardencie of loue, On the forbidden thinges our eyes are fixt; Whose accents still doth loues affections moue; Thus stolen loue is eu'r with feare possest, For shadowes glymse oft feares the friendly guest. Sonetto. 24. [Th'impatient rage of fretting Ielosie] Th'impatient rage of fretting Ielosie, Suspectes the windes that comes from Cupids winges, Whose watch preuents the oportunitie, Whose louers seeke to cure his noysome stinges: Ech looke, a feare, infuseth to the minde, That gauled is with such a base conceyte, Which makes them proue to their hearts-ioyes vnkinde. When loue sweete-ones, of sorrowe, sucke the teate: Yf one but speake to doe another right, Suspect sayth then, of smoke there commeth fier, His good deserts are houlden in despite? And rancor doth his cruell fate conspire. So Ielosie still breedeth base suspect, Whose fruitelesse feare there owne good name detect. Sonetto. 25. [If Argus, with his hundred eyes, did watch] If Argus, with his hundred eyes, did watch In vaine, when oft loue did his cunning blynde: Who doubtes but shee that meanes to make a match? For to performe both time and place can finde. And to abridge a woman of her will, Is to powre oyle in fier, to quench the flame: For then far more she is inclined still, (Though once despis'd) agayne to seeke the same. Loue doth commaund, and it must be obayde; The sacred deitie of the god is much, Whose maiestie makes louers oft afrayde, That to his shrine with bended knee they crutch. This is the cause, let women beare no blame, Who would not play if they did like the game. Sonetto. 26. [Wheare true desire, (in simpathie of minde)] Wheare true desire, (in simpathie of minde) Hath ioin'd the heartes, with Aphrodites delight, Mere louing zeale, (to swete aspect inclin'd) Will finde a time in spite of fortunes might. Argvs foresight, whose wake-full heedie eyes Seeke to preuent the wynged Gods commaunde, Is all to weake his charmes for to surprise; Gainst whose resolue his cunning could not stande: Yet if in Delphos sleepie laye the God, Authoritie gainst Hundreth eies had fayld, But Mercvrie, with his enchaunting rod; Brought all a sleepe; when Argus loue assayl'd: Then since such happs to watching is assign'd, Nothinge is harde where willing is the minde. Sonetto. 27. Daungers altered delayes in loue. The heart inthraul'd with loues attractiue force, (Whose hope doth martch with honours equipage, When reason doth his true desertes remorse) Must take his time his sorrowes to assuage: For cheeries ripe will not so long endure, But will in time, fade, wither, and decay, That which this day, could finest wittes allure; To-morrowe, Coridon doth cast away, The Iron being hot who list not for to strike, Shall sure, being colde, neu'r forge it to his minde, And all those partes, moueth loue to like; Doe oft (in time) make loue to proue vnkinde. Eu'n so in time daunger attends delaye, For time and tide for no mans pleasures staye. Sonetto. 28. [Was Io watch'd by Argus in the downes?] Was Io watch'd by Argus in the downes? What did not then the winged god inchaunt, The heardmans eyes, obaying Iunos frownes: What needes loues crosse so much to make her vaunt, The brazen tower could not his valour quaile, Who scorn'd that Danae should liue a maide: Loues inward force gainst enuy will preuaile, And hap what may: his lawes must be obayd. What though fayre starre thy glorie is obscur'd: And cou'rd with a thicke and foggie cloude: Yet Titan when he hath the heau'ns invr'd, Will cleere the stormes which fatall frownes did shrowde. And though that fate abridgeth our delight, Yet time I hope will cleare this cloudie spight. Sonetto. 29. [The fluent streame, whose stealing course being stayed] The fluent streame, whose stealing course being stayed, Breakes out vnto a greater deluge rage, The force of fier with violence delayed, Makes all thinges weake his furie to asswage: Desire contrould, will agrauate desire, And fancie crost will fancies force-encrease, When louing thoughtes will motiue loue inspire, Enuies oppose can not their bondes release: Thus currents small doe proue the greatest streames, Small cinders doe encrease, to raging flame, The hardest hartes are pearc'd with beauties beames, I hide my griefe yet loue discours the same: Sweete beautie is the sparke of my desire, And sparkes in time may breede a flaming fier. Sonetto. 30. [Sweete beautie in thy face doth still appeere] Sweete beautie in thy face doth still appeere, Myne onely ioye and best beloued deere: Myne onlye deere and best belou'd content, Reuiue my heart and dyinge spirrits spent: The onlye agent of my thoughtes delight, Embrace my loue and doe not me despight, Secure my feares and solace cares content, With hopes repast to fauour mine entent: The fier will out if fuell doe but want, And loue in time will die if it be scant: Let then desire yeilde fuell to your minde, That loue be not blowen out with euerie winde: So shall my heart like Etnas lasting flame, Burne with your loue and ioye still in the same. Sonetto. 31. [I loue, inforst by loues vnlouing charmes] I loue, inforst by loues vnlouing charmes, My loue is pure, my loue is chast, and true, And that I loue, the greater is my harmes: Yf loue doth purchase hate, then loue adiew. Why should not loue be recompens'd with loue, And true desire, obtayne his due desert, Yf beautie stirre thee to disdayne to moue? When mighty stormes oppresse my troubled hart: Knowe then that truth, may beauties blaze dismay, And loyall hartes, scorne periur'd beauties pride, Yeilde then in time, prolonge not my delay? Lest others should your beauties grace deride: So shall your worthes eternished remaine, And gaine his loue which others pride disdaine. To Paris darling. Were I sheapheard as I am a woodman, Thy Paris would I be if not thy goodman. And yet might I performe to thee that dutie, Yf thou wilt add that fauour to thy beautie. Nowe that these feastes make other minions frolike, Why is my loue, my doue, so melancholike: O but I neere gesse, what the cause should be, Which to tell, tel-tale paper, were but follie; Ile therefore for this time conceale it wholye: For that must counsell betwixt thee and mee, Twixt thee and mee where none may heere nor see. Buen matina. Sweete at this mourne I chaunced, To peepe into the chamber; loe I glaunced: And sawe white sheetes, thy whyter skinne disclosing; And soft-sweete cheeke on pyllowe soft reposing; Then sayde were I that pillowe, Deere for thy loue I would not weare the willowe. Maddrigall. [Madame, that nowe I kisse your white handes later] Madame, that nowe I kisse your white handes later Then wild my louing dutie, Retayner to thy beautie: The water crost my wishe, to crosse the water. Yet thinke not (sweete) those gallants helde thee deerer, Who for thy beauties, then the sunneshine cleerer: Eu'n seas vneu'n haue coasted, But thou art wise and know'st it: No; thy Leander, whose hartes firie matter, Cannot be quench'd, by the deuyding water, Will with his oare-like armes quite sheare a sunder The waues that floate him vnder: Yf when I shall so trie mee, In thy sweete circled armes I may respire mee. Rounde-delay. [Couldst thou none other spite me] Couldst thou none other spite me, When but once fortune friendly did indite me: Thy selfe thou should'st absent mee? And all vnkinde, vnkinde, to more torment me. I haue not thus deserued, To be with tell-tale Tantalus hunger-starued: That hauing store of dishes, I could not feede according to my wishes? But this he for reuealinge, Gods counsell bide: and I for yours concealing: In this yet do we varie, That desert to his, is quite contrary? Then ô most kinde and cruell, (Except thou minde to starue thy beauties fuell) For all my loue, fayth, dutye, Let me but pray, Ipray thee on thy beautie: And thou my new-borne dittie, Desire her for my second dishe but pittie. Maddrigall. [Loue, iust loue, not luste, thus constant liue I] Loue, iust loue, not luste, thus constant liue I: My lyfes deere loue mislikes me, Yet her sweete fayre doth like me: Yf loue dislikes; to like and loue why should I? Yf she be coy, why should her loue be trustie? Yf she be slowe; why should I be so hastie? Yet loyall hart hath vow'd it, And constant truth performes it: Fayre; to thy beauties fayre, firme haue I vowed, Sound is the seede that my resolue hath sowed. But weede is the fruite that my fate hath mowed Yet luste I banish, louing True zeale, I liue, yet still dying: Thus still to be constant eu're haue I plowed. Rounde-delay. [Much griefe did still torment me] Much griefe did still torment me, In this regard thou doest thy selfe absent me; Thy beauty (ah) delightes me? And this thou know'st to well and therefore spites me. So womens mindes doe varie, And change of ayre doth worke quite contrarie; Proofe tried my truth and trust too, Still to be thine, most constant, firme and iust too: Therefore shouldest regard me, And loue for loue (fayre loue) thou should'st award me, For since I still attend thee, Howe canst thou choose vnkinde (vnkinde) but friend me, Fayne I alone would finde thee, That my hearts griefe (swete hart) might th? vnbinde thee: For were I with thee resident, I doubt not I, to be of thy heart president; Yeilde then to loue (loue kinde is) Else would I had byn blinde, eu'n as loue blinde is.</field>
