      <field name="fulltext">I. Our blessed Mother, who is full of grace, While she was yet of very tender years, Turned from her parents without grief or tears, And made her dwelling in the holy place, Obedient to the summons in her heart; Blind to the world, and deaf to all its praise, To work for God, and pray, and pass her days With those who choose the good, the better, part. The priest and Temple servants welcome her With open arms, who gives herself to God. Others remain below to toil and plod; She mounts to heights of goodness, as it were. As God has called her, gladly she will go. Never a thought will cross her earnest mind Of things which she has lost and left behind. God is her end; 'tis all she cares to know. O happy parents! Happy Joachim, And happy Ann, to give so sweet a prize To God who asks it of you; in your eyes The tears are tears of joy which make them dim. II. So Mary in the Temple takes her place With joy to serve the holy God; apart From evil; and the rapture in her heart Is greater than the rapture in her face. She scrubs and dusts; she sweeps the marble floor. She makes the linen things as white as snow; Not whiter than her pure heart, all aglow With love for God, even to its very core. Before the sunrise, she is still the light Of all the holy place. Before the hour Of sacrifice her prayers ascend with power Before God's throne, like incense in his sight. And when her work is done she gives her soul Again to spoken prayers. And through the deep Night-watches, whether waking or asleep. She is still God's, immaculate and whole. Until, for reasons which we cannot tell, The time has come when she must be espoused To Joseph. This new call of God aroused Her tranquil mind to do His holy will. God calls and she obeys; still calm and meek, She lays her white hand in Saint Joseph's hands, She plights her troth to God, who understands Her vow, accepting it; why should she seek To know what God has not as yet revealed? God's Lily; God's sweet Rose; His House of gold; His tower of ivory long ago foretold; The Garden of the Lord; the Fountain sealed. III. Mary is praying in her humble home. No carriage wheels are ever heard before Her house. No pomp has ever crossed her door, Nor any splendour of the court of Rome. Yet who is this who comes so splendidly In robes and jewels of another world, With shimmering wings all crisp and softly curled In heaven's highest air? What can it be? Hail, full of grace, he says; his voice is sweet Just as his clothes are splendid, and his face Is all alight with heaven. Full of grace! Strange words! strange posture, kneeling at her feet! Mary has never known the noise and crush Of crowded courts. The courtier's flattering tongue Has never lied to her, who lived among The humble and the poor; but in the hush Of her still chamber she has prayed alone To God so much, that now she has no fear To face a shining angel, or to hear The gracious message sent from God's high throne. She says: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; And be it done to me as thou hast said. Strong in her faith, she bows her lowly head; Heaven breaks forth in song with one accord. IV. Great Gabriel, when he knelt before his queen, Told her of great things which the Lord had done, And how Elizabeth should bear a son. His message given, he was no more seen. Then rising up (for Mary gave no time To gossip or to dreams) she cast her cloak About her shoulders, took her staff, and spoke To no one, but set out at once to climb The rough steep road before her. She must go To see Elizabeth without delay. Her charitable errand made the way Seem short; what besitation could she know? And soon her light step meets her cousin's ear. Her voice is ringing like a silver bell. Gladness and peace and purity as well Breathe upon everyone when she comes near. And whence is this to me, her cousin cries, That my Lord's mother thus should come to me? Blessed among all women! Zachary Approaches at the sound with wondering eyes. O what a contrast! Zachary cannot speak Through wanting faith, while Mary sings her song Of praise. O were our faith but half so strong As thine is! Help us, Mother, who are weak. V. About the time when Jesus should be born, Wise men in distant countries saw a star New-set in beaven; and followed it afar Night after night, untired from dusk till morn. They rode their camels hard, and hurried them Across the waste and through the wilderness; The star went still in front, and shone no less Until at length they reached Jerusalem. It did not cross their minds to hope to find The king except in Herod's palace; since They only knew the star foretold a prince, And not the meek Redeemer of mankind. Herod's dark mind grew darker as he heard Their tale. He smiled and scoffed, and smiled again. But while he seemed to treat it with disdain, He gave attentive heed to every word. What new king can it be when I am king? I am the king whose kingdom has no end. Thus Herod's vain thoughts mocked him. I will send And slaughter every new-born Caesarling. These three wise kings are fools, he thought; and I Should be a greater fool if men adore Another king while I am king. Before That happens, though, the new-born king shall die. His wicked thought was prophecy; but still, Though the king died, it was not to be yet. Men plan and work their crimes; but they forget All things are subject to the Almighty will. VI. Now certain shepherds watched their flocks by night Over by Bethlehem, all dark and still. They played upon their rustic pipes until Another morning brought return of light. And as the star had told the kings a king Was to be born in Israel, so now The angel comes to tell the shepherds how Almighty God has done a wondrous thing. He tells the glory of the new-born Child, The beavenly Shepherd, who will lead His folk Away from Satan's kingdom, and the yoke Of sin; not rough and coarse, but kind and mild. And as the angel left them, hark, the song Of angels is resounding in the sky, Singing: All glory be to God on high. Come, said the shepherds: let us go along And see the Infant born in Bethlehem. I long to see Him as He lies asleep In Mary's arms. And never mind the sheep; The hosts of angels will look after them. VII. They came with haste, and found the gloomy cave Made light and lovely by the Babe. They tapped Upon the door. They saw the Baby wrapped In swaddling clothes, the Shepherd who should save His people from their sins. O happy sight! Sweet Mother, said they, we would see thy Son, Show us the Lamb of God, the Holy One Of God. We would adore Him if we might. Then graciously she drew aside the veil And showed these lowly men the Infant's face, The face of God. O Mary, full of Grace, Blessed be God who blesseth thee, all hail! And falling on their knees they each adored Sweet Mary's holy Baby. And again They called themselves the happiest of men. And Mary took their praise without a word. VIII. And while the shepherds loitered, suddenly The kings arrive, with all their numerous train; Those who had come with so much toil and pain Following the kindly star, that they might see The new-born King. The shepherds were afraid At such a sight; but Mary had no fear. Saint Joseph bade the visitors come near, Beside the Infant and the spotless maid, His holy Mother. While the happy kings, To whom men knelt, themselves knelt humbly down, Each offered Him his kingdom and his crown, And frankincense and myrrh and costly things. God gave the kings such faith that, while they saw The misery of the stable, and the poor Weak Babe, they knew that He would give them more Than they gave Him. They knew His mighty law Is that which guides the stars, and turns the heart, The wicked heart of man, and makes it clean. They offer Him their hearts, they beg the Queen To intercede for them; and they depart As softly as they came. When they were gone No flush of pride appeared on Mary's cheek; But to the Child she said, in accents meek: Thou art my King, my Kingdom; Thou alone Art all my Riches, Saviour of all men. Let kings bow low before Thee; deeper still My heart bows down to Thee, my God; until Thou crown me in Thy glory, Child. Amen. IX. Obedient to the law, the Child is brought By Mary to the Temple to be shown, And offered to Jehovah, who alone Is Lord of all; and then He must be bought With a small offering back to Mary's care. Just for one dreadful moment, all she loves Is lifted from her arms. She takes the doves And offers them at once; she cannot bear To be without Him. But a new delay Makes her poor heart beat faster still; her eyes Are fixed upon the Infant as He lies In Simeon's arms. Now many a long day And many a year of hope and prayer had passed Since God had promised Him he should not die Until he saw God's kingdom coming nigh. Inspired by God, he knows it come at last. And now thou dost dismiss thy servant, Lord, According to thy word in peace, he prayed. And then he gave his blessing, as he laid The Child in Mary's arms. One day a sword Shall pierce thy soul, he said. O Mother, filled With sorrow and with grace, console our grief; In all necessity be our relief, Our strength to do all things as God has willed. X. God took upon Himself our human form, And Mary bore Him in this world of sin. Joseph protected both from all the din Of men; and got them food, and kept them warm. What thoughts he had he kept in his own heart. God's silent instrument he wished to be. To see one we must look at all the three. What God has joined let no man tear apart. In Jesus Love of God and men is shown. Incarnate Faith in Mary's form and face. Hope undismayed in Joseph. And his place Is not so very far from Mary's throne. XI. They came with others to Jerusalem From distant Galilee, to keep the feast. As long as they were there they never ceased To pray that God would do His will in them. The Blessed Mother Mary did not know How soon so sharp a trial would be laid Upon her. She has lost her Son. Dismayed, And full of grief, she hurries to and fro Among her kinsmen through the caravan. Where is my Boy? Where was He? Have you seen My Son? Where is my Son? He should have been Among us. No one knew. She wept, and ran Along the road, and called His holy name Into the starry night; again; again. Her lips were cold; her heart was numb with pain; She called and wept and prayed; no answer came. Day followed night; night followed day; the sun Rose as she reached the city. With quick pace, She reached the Temple in a little space, And found Him with the doctors. O my Son! XII. Next to the house in Nazareth, a shed Contained a bench, a vice, and workman's tools; Saws, planes and adzes, chisels, squares and rules. And here Saint Joseph toiled for each day's bread. Mary is busy sewing. Jesus stands Beside Saint Joseph, working through the day. He did not come into the world to play At being man, but worked with both His hands. Joseph has taught Him how to use the plumb And spirit-level; bradawls, bits and brace; He does not let Him use the axe, in case He might chop off a finger or a thumb. Thus He who built the world now condescends To learn the joiner's trade, and handle saws And chisels for His bread, who made the laws Which guide a million planets to their ends. XIII. Jesus is dead, and the disciples flee. Mother, if ever, now thy faith is tried. The sword foretold has pierced thy soul, beside The cross. Who now on earth can comfort thee? What tongue can ever tell the bitterness Which over whelmed thee? We may be assured Only the anguish which thy Son endured Surpassed thy soul's unutterable distress. Before He died, Our Lord said to Saint John, Whose head had rested on His breast: Behold Thy Mother, Son. And from that hour, we are told, The loved disciple took her to his own. O mighty Mother of all sorrow, lean On him whom Jesus taught to be thy son, When He Himself was gone. Teach everyone Of us to be thy child as John has been. XIV. We saw the blessed Mother as a child Humble and strong, mounting the Temple stair; The road she took to God, all unaware Of any wickedness, and unbeguiled By any wonder of this passing earth. Not men, but God she sought to please. Her eyes Were firmly fixed upon a distant prize. She looked for peace, not pleasure; joy, not mirth; Eternal blessedness was what she sought. She bore God's Son; she loved Him; and she gave Him up to bitterest death, that He might save All men for God, for God was all her thought. And then she waited till the time was come That God should call her to her glittering place Beside Himself in glory. Full of grace And confidence she entered in her home. Archangels, angels, prophets, martyrs, all The host of heaven, in infinite array, Stand back for her; and line her shining way To God; and, at His holy bidding, fall Before their Queen, the chosen of the Lord. The pierced hands shape, from heaven's purest rays And gems unspeakable, a crown of praise For her. O Mary, Great is thy reward!</field>
