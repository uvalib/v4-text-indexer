      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME ONE HEADLONG HALL SONG. [In his last binn Sir Peter lies] In his last binn Sir Peter lies, Who knew not what it was to frown: Death took him mellow, by surprise, And in his cellar stopped him down. Through all our land we could not boast A knight more gay, more prompt than he, To rise and fill a bumper toast, And pass it round with three times three. None better knew the feast to sway, Or keep Mirth's boat in better trim; For Nature had but little clay Like that of which she moulded him. The meanest guest that graced his board Was there the freest of the free, His bumper toast when Peter poured, And passed it round with three times three. He kept at true good humour's mark The social flow of pleasure's tide: He never made a brow look dark, Nor caused a tear, but when he died. No sorrow round his tomb should dwell: More pleased his gay old ghost would be, For funeral song, and passing bell, To hear no sound but three times three. GLEE. A heeltap! a heeltap! I never could bear it! So fill me a bumper, a bumper of claret! Let the bottle pass freely, don't shirk it not spare it, For a heeltap! a heeltap! I never could bear it! No skylight! no twilight! while Bacchus rules o'er us: No thinking! no shrinking! all drinking in chorus: Let us moisten our clay, since 't is thirsty and porous: No thinking! no shrinking! all drinking in chorus! LOVE AND OPPORTUNITY. Oh! who art thou, so swiftly flying? My name is Love, the child replied: Swifter I pass than south-winds sighing, Or streams, through summer vales that glide And who art thou, his flight pursuing? 'T is cold Neglect whom now you see: The little god you there are viewing, Will die, if once he's touched by me. This stanza is imitated from Machiavelli's Capitolo dell' Occasione.Oh! who art thou so fast proceeding, Ne'er glancing back thine eyes of flame? Marked but by few, through earth I'm speeding, And Opportunity's my name. What form is that, which scowls beside thee? Repentance is the form you see: Learn then, the fate may yet betide thee: She seizes them who seize not me. TERZETTO. Imitated from a passage in the Purgatorio of Dante. [Grey Twilight, from her shadowy hill] Grey Twilight, from her shadowy hill, Discolours Nature's vernal bloom, And sheds on grove, and field, and rill, One placid tint of deepening gloom. The sailor sighs 'mid shoreless seas, Touched by the thought of friends afar, As, fanned by ocean's flowing breeze, He gazes on the western star. The wanderer hears, in pensive dream, The accents of the last farewell, As, pausing by the mountain stream, He listens to the evening bell. BALLAD. [“O Mary, my sister, thy sorrow give o'er] “O Mary, my sister, thy sorrow give o'er, I soon shall return, girl, and leave thee no more: But with children so fair, and a husband so kind, I shall feel less regret when I leave thee behind. “I have made thee a bench for the door of thy cot, And more would I give thee, but more I have not: Sit and think of me there, in the warm summer day, And give me three kisses, my labour to pay.” She gave him three kisses, and forth did he fare, And long did he wander, and no one knew where; And long from her cottage, through sunshine and rain, She watched his return, but he came not again. Her children grew up, and her husband grew grey; She sate on the bench through the long summer day: One evening, when twilight was deep on the shore, There came an old soldier, and stood by the door. In English he spoke, and none knew what he said, But her oatcake and milk on the table she spread; Then he sate to his supper, and blithely he sung, And she knew the dear sounds of her own native tongue: “O rich are the feasts in the Englishman's hall, And the wine sparkles bright in the goblets of Gaul: But their mingled attractions I well could withstand, For the milk and the oatcake of Meirion's dear land.” “And art thou a Welshman, old soldier?” she cried. “Many years have I wandered,” the stranger replied: “'Twixt Danube and Thames many rivers there be, But the bright waves of Cynfael are fairest to me. “I felled the grey oak, ere I hastened to roam, And I fashioned a bench for the door of my home; And well my dear sister my labour repaid, Who gave me three kisses when first it was made. “In the old English soldier thy brother appears: Here is gold in abundance, the saving of years: Give me oatcake and milk in return for my store, And a seat by thy side on the bench at the door.” CHORUS. [Hail to the Headlong! the Headlong Ap-Headlong!] Hail to the Headlong! the Headlong Ap-Headlong! All hail to the Headlong, the Headlong Ap-Headlong! The Headlong Ap-Headlong Ap-Breakneck Ap-Headlong Ap-Cataract Ap-Pistyll Ap-Rhaiader Ap-Headlong! The bright bowl we steep in the name of the Headlong: Let the youths pledge it deep to the Headlong Ap-Headlong, And the rosy-lipped lasses Touch the brim as it passes, And kiss the red tide for the Headlong Ap-Headlong! The loud harp resounds in the hall of the Headlong: The light step rebounds in the hall of the Headlong: Where shall music invite us, Or beauty delight us, If not in the hall of the Headlong Ap-Headlong? Huzza! to the health of the Headlong Ap-Headlong! Fill the bowl, fill in floods, to the health of the Headlong! Till the stream ruby-glowing, On all sides o'erflowing, Shall fall in cascades to the health of the Headlong! The Headlong Ap-Headlong Ap-Breakneck Ap-Headlong Ap-Cataract Ap-Pistyll Ap-Rhaiader Ap-Headlong!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME TWO MELINCOURT “Nous nous moquons des Paladins! quand ces maximes romanesques commencerent à devenir ridicules, ce changement fut moins l'ouvrage de la raison que celui des mauvaises mœurs.” —Rousseau. THE TOMB OF LOVE By the mossy weed-flowered column, Where the setting moonbeam's glance Streams a radiance cold and solemn On the haunts of old romance: Know'st thou what those shafts betoken, Scattered on that tablet lone, Where the ivory bow lies broken By the monumental stone? When true knighthood's shield, neglected, Mouldered in the empty hall; When the charms that shield protected Slept in death's eternal thrall; When chivalric glory perished Like the pageant of a dream, Love in vain its memory cherished, Fired in vain the minstrel's theme. Falsehood to an elvish minion Did the form of Love impart: Cunning plumed its vampire pinion; Avarice tipped its golden dart. Love, the hideous phantom flying, Hither came, no more to rove: There his broken bow is lying On that stone—the tomb of Love! [“What makes all doctrines plain and clear?] “What makes all doctrines plain and clear? About two hundred pounds a year.— And that which was proved true before, Prove false again?—Two hundred more.” GLEE—THE GHOSTS. In life three ghostly friars were we, And now three friarly ghosts we be. Around our shadowy table placed, The spectral bowl before us floats: With wine that none but ghosts can taste, We wash our unsubstantial throats. Three merry ghosts—three merry ghosts—three merry ghosts are we: Let the ocean be Port, and we'll think it good sport To be laid in that Red Sea. With songs that jovial spectres chaunt, Our old refectory still we haunt. The traveller hears our midnight mirth: “O list!” he cries, “the haunted choir! “The merriest ghost that walks the earth, “Is sure the ghost of a ghostly friar.” Three merry ghosts—three merry ghosts—three merry ghosts are we: Let the ocean be Port, and we'll think it good sport To be laid in that Red Sea. THE FLOWER OF LOVE. 'Tis said the rose is Love's own flower, Its blush so bright, its thorns so many; And winter on its bloom has power, But has not on its sweetness any. For though young Love's ethereal rose Will droop on Age's wintry bosom, Yet still its faded leaves disclose The fragrance of their earliest blossom. But ah! the fragrance lingering there Is like the sweets that mournful duty Bestows with sadly-soothing care, To deck the grave of bloom and beauty. For when its leaves are shrunk and dry, Its blush extinct, to kindle never, That fragrance is but Memory's sigh, That breathes of pleasures past for ever. Why did not Love the amaranth choose, That bears no thorns, and cannot perish? Alas! no sweets its flowers diffuse, And only sweets Love's life can cherish. But be the rose and amaranth twined, And Love, their mingled powers assuming, Shall round his brows a chaplet bind, For ever sweet, for ever blooming. THE LADY, THE KNIGHT, AND THE FRIAR. BALLAD TERZETTO. THE LADY. O cavalier! what dost thou here, Thy tuneful vigils keeping; While the northern star looks cold from far, And half the world is sleeping? THE KNIGHT. O lady! here, for seven long year, Have I been nightly sighing, Without the hope of a single tear To pity me were I dying. THE LADY. Should I take thee to have and to hold, Who hast nor lands nor money? Alas! 'tis only in flowers of gold That married bees find honey. THE KNIGHT. O lady fair! to my constant prayer Fate proves at last propitious; And bags of gold in my hand I bear, And parchment scrolls delicious. THE LADY. My maid the door shall open throw, For we too long have tarried: The friar keeps watch in the cellar below, And we will at once be married. THE FRIAR. My children! great is Fortune's power; And plain this truth appears, That gold thrives more in a single hour, Than love in seven long years. TERZETTO. [Hark! o'er the silent waters stealing] 1. Hark! o'er the silent waters stealing, The dash of oars sounds soft and clear: Through night's deep veil, all forms concealing, Nearer it comes, and yet more near. 2. See! where the long reflection glistens, In yon lone tower her watch-light burns: 3. To hear our distant oars she listens, And, listening, strikes the harp by turns. 1. The stars are bright, the skies unclouded; No moonbeam shines; no breezes wake: Is it my love, in darkness shrouded, Whose dashing oar disturbs the lake? 2. O haste, sweet maid, the cords unrolling; The holy hermit chides our stay!1. 2. 3. Hark! from his lonely islet tolling, His midnight bell shall guide our way. THE MORNING OF LOVE. O! the spring-time of life is the season of blooming, And the morning of love is the season of joy; Ere noontide and summer, with radiance consuming, Look down on their beauty, to parch and destroy. O! faint are the blossoms life's pathway adorning, When the first magic glory of hope is withdrawn; For the flowers of the spring, and the light of the morning, Have no summer budding, and no second dawn. Through meadows all sunshine, and verdure, and flowers, The stream of the valley in purity flies; But mixed with the tides, where some proud city lowers, O! where is the sweetness that dwelt on its rise? The rose withers fast on the breast it first graces; Its beauty is fled ere the day be half done:— And life is that stream which its progress defaces, And love is that flower which can bloom but for one. [O sovereign Sleep! in whose papaverous glen] O sovereign Sleep! in whose papaverous glen Dwell the dark Muses of Cimmerian men! O Power of Dreams! whose dusky pinions shed Primæval chaos on the slumberer's head! Ye misty Clouds! amid whose folds sublime Blind Faith invokes the Ghost of Feudal Time! And thou, thick Night! beneath whose mantle rove The Phantom Powers of Subterranean Jove! Arise, propitious to the mystic strain, From Lethe's flood, and Zeal's Tartarian fane; Where Freedom's Shade, 'mid Stygian vapours damp, Sits, cold and pale, by Truth's extinguished lamp; While Cowls and Crowns portentous orgies hold, And tuneful Proteus seals his eyes with gold! THE SUN-DIAL. The ivy o'er the mouldering wall Spreads like a tree, the growth of years: The wild wind through the doorless hall A melancholy music rears, A solitary voice, that sighs O'er man's forgotten pageantries. Above the central gate, the clock, Through clustering ivy dimly seen, Seems, like the ghost of Time, to mock The wrecks of power that once has been. The hands are rusted on its face; Even where they ceased, in years gone by, To keep the flying moments pace; Fixing, in Fancy's thoughtful eye, A point of ages passed away, A speck of time, that owns no tie With aught that lives and breathes to-day. But 'mid the rank and towering grass, Where breezes wave, in mournful sport, The weeds that choke the ruined court, The careless hours that circling pass, Still trace upon the dialled brass The shade of their unvarying way: And evermore, with every ray That breaks the clouds and gilds the air, Time's stealthy steps are imaged there: Even as the long-revolving years In self-reflecting circles flow, From the first bud the hedge-row bears, To wintry Nature's robe of snow. The changeful forms of mortal things Decay and pass; and art and power Oppose in vain the doom that flings Oblivion on their closing hour: While still, to every woodland vale, New blooms, new fruits, the seasons bring, For other eyes and lips to hail With looks and sounds of welcoming: As where some stream light-eddying roves By sunny meads and shadowy groves, Wave following wave departs for ever, But still flows on the eternal river. MR. FEATHERNEST, MR. VAMP, MR. KILLTHEDEAD, MR. PAPERSTAMP, AND MR. ANYSIDE ANTIJACK. QUINTETTO. To the tune of “Turning, turning, turning, as the wheel goes round.” RECITATIVE. MR. PAPERSTAMP. Jack Horner's Christmas pie my learned nurse Interpreted to mean the public purse. From thence a plum he drew. O happy Horner! Who would not be ensconced in thy snug corner? THE FIVE. While round the public board all eagerly we linger, For what we can get we will try, try, try: And we'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. MR. FEATHERNEST. By my own poetic laws, I'm a dealer in applause For those who don't deserve it, but will buy, buy, buy: So round the court I linger, and thus I get a finger, A finger, finger, finger in the Christmas pie. THE FIVE. And we'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. MR. VAMP. My share of pie to win, I will dash through thick and thin, And philosophy and liberty shall fly, fly, fly: And truth and taste shall know, that their everlasting foe Has a finger, finger, finger in the Christmas pie. THE FIVE. And we'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. MR. KILLTHEDEAD. I'll make my verses rattle with the din of war and battle, For war doth increase sa-la-ry, ry, ry: And I'll shake the public ears with the triumph of Algiers, And thus I'll get a finger in the Christmas pie. THE FIVE. And we'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. MR. PAPERSTAMP. And while you thrive by ranting, I'll try my luck at canting, And scribble verse and prose all so dry, dry, dry: And Mystic's patent smoke public intellect shall choke, And we'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. THE FIVE. We'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. MR. ANYSIDE ANTIJACK. My tailor is so clever, that my coat will turn for ever, And take any colour you can dye, dye, dye: For all my earthly wishes are among the loaves and fishes, And to have my little finger in the Christmas pie. THE FIVE. And we'll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, We'll all have a finger in the Christmas pie. THE MAGIC BARK. I O Freedom! power of life and light! Sole nurse of truth and glory! Bright dweller on the rocky cliff! Lone wanderer on the sea! Where'er the sunbeam slumbers bright On snow-clad mountains hoary; Wherever flies the veering skiff, O'er waves that breathe of thee! Be thou the guide of all my thought— The source of all my being— The genius of my waking mind— The spirit of my dreams! To me thy magic spell be taught, The captive spirit freeing, To wander with the ocean-wind Where'er thy beacon beams. II O! sweet it were, in magic bark, On one loved breast reclining, To sail around the varied world, To every blooming shore; And oft the gathering storm to mark Its lurid folds combining; And safely ride, with sails unfurled, Amid the tempest's roar; And see the mighty breakers rave On cliff, and sand, and shingle, And hear, with long re-echoing shock, The caverned steeps reply; And while the storm-cloud and the wave In darkness seemed to mingle, To skim beside the surf-swept rock, And glide uninjured by. III And when the summer seas were calm, And summer skies were smiling, And evening came, with clouds of gold, To gild the western wave; And gentle airs and dews of balm, The pensive mind beguiling, Should call the Ocean Swain to fold His sea-flocks in the cave, Unearthly music's tenderest spell, With gentlest breezes blending And waters softly rippling near The prow's light course along, Should flow from Triton's winding shell, Through ocean's depths ascending From where it charmed the Nereid's ear, Her coral bowers among. IV How sweet, where eastern Nature smiles, With swift and mazy motion Before the odour-breathing breeze Of dewy morn to glide; Or, 'mid the thousand emerald isles That gem the southern ocean, Where fruits and flowers, from loveliest trees, O'erhang the slumbering tide: Or up some western stream to sail, To where its myriad fountains Roll down their everlasting rills From many a cloud-capped height, Till mingling in some nameless vale, 'Mid forest-cinctured mountains, The river-cataract shakes the hills With vast and volumed might. V The poison-trees their leaves should shed, The yellow snake should perish, The beasts of blood should crouch and cower, Where'er that vessel past: All plagues of fens and vapours bred, That tropic fervors cherish, Should fly before its healing power, Like mists before the blast. Where'er its keel the strand imprest, The young fruit's ripening cluster, The bird's free song, its touch should greet, The opening flower's perfume; The streams along the green earth's breast Should roll in purer lustre, And love should heighten every sweet, And brighten every bloom. VI And, Freedom! thy meridian blaze Should chase the clouds that lower, Wherever mental twilight dim Obscures Truth's vestal flame, Wherever Fraud and Slavery raise The throne of blood-stained Power, Wherever Fear and Ignorance hymn Some fabled dæmon's name! The bard, where torrents thunder down Beside thy burning altar, Should kindle, as in days of old, The mind's ethereal fire; Ere yet beneath a tyrant's frown The Muse's voice could falter, Or Flattery strung with chords of gold The minstrel's venal lyre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THREE NIGHTMARE ABBEY AND MAID MARIAN NIGHTMARE ABBEY There's a dark lantern of the spirit, Which none see by but those who bear it, That makes them in the dark see visions And hag themselves with apparitions, Find racks for their own minds, and vaunt Of their own misery and want. Butler. [Why are thy looks so blank, grey friar?] Why are thy looks so blank, grey friar? Why are thy looks so blue? Thou seem'st more pale and lank, grey friar, Than thou wast used to do:— Say, what has made thee rue? Thy form was plump, and a light did shine In thy round and ruby face, Which showed an outward visible sign Of an inward spiritual grace:— Say, what has changed thy case? Yet will I tell thee true, grey friar, I very well can see, That, if thy looks are blue, grey friar, 'Tis all for love of me,— 'Tis all for love of me. But breathe not thy vows to me, grey friar, Oh, breathe them not, I pray; For ill beseems in a reverend friar, The love of a mortal may; And I needs must say thee nay. But, could'st thou think my heart to move With that pale and silent scowl? Know, he who would win a maiden's love, Whether clad in cap or cowl, Must be more of a lark than an owl. [There is a fever of the spirit] MR. CYPRESS sung— There is a fever of the spirit, The brand of Cain's unresting doom, Which in the lone dark souls that bear it Glows like the lamp in Tullia's tomb: Unlike that lamp, its subtle fire Burns, blasts, consumes its cell, the heart, Till, one by one, hope, joy, desire, Like dreams of shadowy smoke depart. When hope, love, life itself, are only Dust—spectral memories—dead and cold— The unfed fire burns bright and lonely, Like that undying lamp of old: And by that drear illumination, Till time its clay-built home has rent, Thought broods on feeling's desolation— The soul is its own monument. [Seamen three! What men be ye?] MR. HILARY AND THE REVEREND MR. LARYNX. Seamen three! What men be ye? Gotham's three wise men we be. Whither in your bowl so free? To rake the moon from out the sea. The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine. And our ballast is old wine; And your ballast is old wine. Who art thou, so fast adrift? I am he they call Old Care. Here on board we will thee lift. No: I may not enter there. Wherefore so? 'Tis Jove's decree, In a bowl Care may not be; In a bowl Care may not be. Fear ye not the waves that roll? No: in charmed bowl we swim. What the charm that floats the bowl? Water may not pass the brim. The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine. And our ballast is old wine; And your ballast is old wine. MAID MARIAN. Yet thanks I must you con, that you work not In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft In limited professions —Timon of Athens. [“The bramble, the bramble, the bonny forest bramble] “The bramble, the bramble, the bonny forest bramble, Doth make a jest Of silken vest, That will through greenwood scramble: The bramble, the bramble, the bonny forest bramble.” [The courtly pad doth amble] The courtly pad doth amble, When his gay lord would ramble: But both may catch An awkward scratch, If they ride among the bramble: The bramble, the bramble, the bonny forest bramble.” [But wherefore does the sheep wear wool?] But wherefore does the sheep wear wool? That he in season sheared may be, And the shepherd be warm though his flock be cool: So I'll have a new cloak about me.” [The rose on the nose doth all virtues disclose] The rose on the nose doth all virtues disclose: For the outward grace shows That the inward overflows, When it glows in the rose of a red, red nose.” [The damsel stood to watch the fight] The damsel stood to watch the fight By the banks of Kingslea Mere, And they brought to her feet her own true knight Sore-wounded on a bier. She knelt by him his wounds to bind, She washed them with many a tear: And shouts rose fast upon the wind, Which told that the foe was near. “Oh! let not,” he said, “while yet I live, The cruel foe me take: But with thy sweet lips a last kiss give, And cast me in the lake.” Around his neck she wound her arms, And she kissed his lips so pale: And evermore the war's alarms Came louder up the vale. She drew him to the lake's steep side, Where the red heath fringed the shore; She plunged with him beneath the tide, And they were seen no more. Their true blood mingled in Kingslea Mere, That to mingle on earth was fain: And the trout that swims in that crystal clear Is tinged with the crimson stain. [For the slender beech and the sapling oak] For the slender beech and the sapling oak, That grow by the shadowy rill, You may cut down both at a single stroke, You may cut down which you will. But this you must know, that as long as they grow, Whatever change may be, You never can teach either oak or beech To be aught but a greenwood tree.” [The love that follows fain] The love that follows fain Will never its faith betray: But the faith that is held in a chain Will never be found again, If a single link give way. [For hark! hark! hark!] For hark! hark! hark! The dog doth bark, That watches the wild deer's lair. The hunter awakes at the peep of the dawn, But the lair it is empty, the deer it is gone, And the hunter knows not where. [Then follow, oh follow! the hounds do cry] Then follow, oh follow! the hounds do cry: The red sun flames in the eastern sky: The stag bounds over the hollow. He that lingers in spirit, or loiters in hall, Shall see us no more till the evening fall, And no voice but the echo shall answer his call: Then follow, oh follow, follow: Follow, oh follow, follow! [Though I be now a grey, grey friar] Though I be now a grey, grey friar, Yet I was once a hale young knight: The cry of my dogs was the only choir In which my spirit did take delight. Little I recked of matin bell, But drowned its toll with my clanging horn: And the only beads I loved to tell Were the beads of dew on the spangled thorn. [An archer keen I was withal] An archer keen I was withal, As ever did lean on greenwood tree; And could make the fleetest roebuck fall, A good three hundred yards from me. Though changeful time, with hand severe, Has made me now these joys forego, Yet my heart bounds whene'er I hear Yoicks! hark away! and tally ho! [A staff, a staff, of a young oak graff] A staff, a staff, of a young oak graff, That is both stoure and stiff, Is all a good friar can needs desire To shrive a proud sherîffe. And thou, fine fellôwe, who hast tasted so Of the forester's greenwood game, Wilt be in no haste thy time to waste In seeking more taste of the same: Or this can I read thee, and riddle thee well, Thou hadst better by far be the devil in hell, Than the sheriff of Nottinghâme. [Drink and sing, and eat and laugh] Drink and sing, and eat and laugh, And so go forth to battle: For the top of a skull and the end of a staff Do make a ghostly rattle. [For I must seek some hermit cell] For I must seek some hermit cell, Where I alone my beads may tell, And on the wight who that way fares Levy a toll for my ghostly pray'rs, Levy a toll, levy a toll, Levy a toll for my ghostly pray'rs.” [Oh! bold Robin Hood is a forester good] Oh! bold Robin Hood is a forester good, As ever drew bow in the merry greenwood: At his bugle's shrill singing the echoes are ringing, The wild deer are springing for many a rood: Its summons we follow, through brake, over hollow, The thrice-blown shrill summons of bold Robin Hood. And what eye hath e'er seen such a sweet Maiden Queen, As Marian, the pride of the forester's green? A sweet garden-flower, she blooms in the bower, Where alone to this hour the wild rose has been: We hail her in duty the queen of all beauty: We will live, we will die, by our sweet Maiden queen. And here's a grey friar, good as heart can desire, To absolve all our sins as the case may require: Who with courage so stout, lays his oak-plant about, And puts to the rout all the foes of his choir: For we are his choristers, we merry foresters, Chorussing thus with our militant friar. And Scarlet doth bring his good yew-bough and string, Prime minister is he of Robin our king: No mark is too narrow for little John's arrow, That hits a cock sparrow a mile on the wing; Robin and Mariòn, Scarlet, and Little John, Long with their glory old Sherwood shall ring. Each a good liver, for well-feathered quiver Doth furnish brawn, venison, and fowl of the river: But the best game we dish up, it is a fat bishop: When his angels we fish up, he proves a free giver: For a prelate so lowly has angels more holy, And should this world's false angels to sinners deliver. Robin and Mariòn, Scarlet and Little John, Drink to them one by one, drink as ye sing: Robin and Mariòn, Scarlet and Little John, Echo to echo through Sherwood shall fling: Robin and Mariòn, Scarlet and Little John, Long with their glory old Sherwood shall ring. [Bold Robin has robed him in ghostly attire] Bold Robin has robed him in ghostly attire, And forth he is gone like a holy friar, Singing, hey down, ho down, down, derry down: And of two grey friars he soon was aware, Regaling themselves with dainty fare, All on the fallen leaves so brown. “Good morrow, good brothers,” said bold Robin Hood, “And what make you in the good greenwood, Singing hey down, ho down, down, derry down! Now give me, I pray you, wine and food; For none can I find in the good greenwood, All on the fallen leaves so brown.” “Good brother,” they said, “we would give you full fain, But we have no more than enough for twain, Singing, hey down, ho down, down, derry down.” “Then give me some money,” said bold Robin Hood, “For none can I find in the good greenwood, All on the fallen leaves so brown.” “No money have we, good brother,” said they: “Then,” said he, “we three for money will pray: Singing, hey down, ho down, down, derry down: And whatever shall come at the end of our prayer, We three holy friars will piously share, All on the fallen leaves so brown.” “We will not pray with thee, good brother, God wot: For truly, good brother, thou pleasest us not, Singing hey down, ho down, down, derry down:” Then up they both started from Robin to run, But down on their knees Robin pulled them each one, All on the fallen leaves so brown. The grey friars prayed with a doleful face, But bold Robin prayed with a right merry grace, Singing, hey down, ho down, down, derry down: And when they had prayed, their portmanteau he took, And from it a hundred good angels he shook, All on the fallen leaves so brown. “The saints,” said bold Robin, “have hearkened our prayer, And here's a good angel apiece for your share: If more you would have, you must win ere you wear: Singing hey down, ho down, down, derry down:” Then he blew his good horn with a musical cheer, And fifty green bowmen came trooping full near, And away the grey friars they bounded like deer, All on the fallen leaves so brown. [Over, over, over, jolly, jolly rover] Over, over, over, jolly, jolly rover, Would you then come over? Over, over, over? Jolly, jolly rover, here's one lives in clover: Who finds the clover? The jolly, jolly rover. He finds the clover, let him then come over, The jolly, jolly rover, over, over, over, [A damsel came in midnight rain] A damsel came in midnight rain, And called across the ferry: The weary wight she called in vain, Whose senses sleep did bury. At evening, from her father's door She turned to meet her lover: At midnight, on the lonely shore, She shouted “Over, over!” She had not met him by the tree Of their accustomed meeting, And sad and sick at heart was she, Her heart all wildly beating. In chill suspense the hours went by, The wild storm burst above her: She turned her to the river nigh, And shouted, “Over, over!” A dim, discoloured, doubtful light The moon's dark veil permitted, And thick before her troubled sight Fantastic shadows flitted. Her lover's form appeared to glide, And beckon o'er the water: Alas! his blood that morn had dyed Her brother's sword with slaughter. Upon a little rock she stood, To make her invocation: She marked not that the rain-swoll'n flood Was islanding her station. The tempest mocked her feeble cry: No saint his aid would give her: The flood swelled high and yet more high, And swept her down the river. Yet oft beneath the pale moonlight, When hollow winds are blowing, The shadow of that maiden bright Glides by the dark stream's flowing. And when the storms of midnight rave, While clouds the broad moon cover, The wild gusts waft across the wave The cry of, “Over, over!” [It was a friar of orders free] It was a friar of orders free, A friar of Rubygill: At the greenwood-tree a vow made he, But he kept it very ill: A vow made he of chastity, But he kept it very ill. He kept it, perchance, in the conscious shade Of the bounds of the forest wherein it was made: But he roamed where he listed, as free as the wind, And he left his good vow in the forest behind: For its woods out of sight were his vow out of mind, With the friar of Rubygill. In lonely hut himself he shut, The friar of Rubygill; Where the ghostly elf absolved himself, To follow his own good will: And he had no lack of canary sack, To keep his conscience still. And a damsel well knew, when at lonely midnight It gleamed on the waters, his signal-lamp-light: “Over! over!” she warbled with nightingale throat, And the friar sprung forth at the magical note, And she crossed the dark stream in his trim ferry-boat, With the friar of Rubygill. [When the wind blows, when the wind blows] When the wind blows, when the wind blows From where under buck the dry log glows, What guide can you follow, O'er brake and o'er hollow, So true as a ghostly, ghostly nose? [Ye woods, that oft at sultry noon] Ye woods, that oft at sultry noon Have o'er me spread your massy shade: Ye gushing streams, whose murmured tune Has in my ear sweet music made, While, where the dancing pebbles show Deep in the restless fountain-pool The gelid water's upward flow, My second flask was laid to cool: Ye pleasant sights of leaf and flower: Ye pleasant sounds of bird and bee: Ye sports of deer in sylvan bower: Ye feasts beneath the greenwood tree: Ye baskings in the vernal sun: Ye slumbers in the summer dell: Ye trophies that this arm has won: And must ye hear your friar's farewell?

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME FOUR THE MISFORTUNES OF ELPHIN AND CROTCHET CASTLE THE MISFORTUNES OF ELPHIN THE CIRCLING OF THE MEAD HORNS. Fill the blue horn, the blue buffalo horn: Natural is mead in the buffalo horn: As the cuckoo in spring, as the lark in the morn, So natural is mead in the buffalo horn. As the cup of the flower to the bee when he sips, Is the full cup of mead to the true Briton's lips: From the flower-cups of summer, on field and on tree, Our mead cups are filled by the vintager bee. Seithenyn The accent is on the second syllable: Seithényn. ap Seithyn, the generous, the bold, Drinks the wine of the stranger from vessels of gold; Gwin . . . . o eur . . . . Aneurin. But we from the horn, the blue silver-rimmed horn, Drink the ale and the mead in our fields that were born. The ale-froth is white, and the mead sparkles bright; They both smile apart, and with smiles they unite: The mixture of ale and mead made bradawd, a favourite drink of the Ancient Britons. The mead from the flower, and the ale from the corn, Smile, sparkle, and sing in the buffalo horn. The horn, the blue horn, cannot stand on its tip; Its path is right on from the hand to the lip: Though the bowl and the wine-cup our tables adorn, More natural the draught from the buffalo horn. But Seithenyn ap Seithyn, the generous, the bold, Drinks the bright-flowing wine from the far-gleaming gold: The wine, in the bowl by his lip that is worn, Shall be glorious as mead in the buffalo horn. The horns circle fast, but their fountains will last, As the stream passes ever, and never is past: Exhausted so quickly, replenished so soon, They wax and they wane like the horns of the moon. Fill high the blue horn, the blue buffalo horn; Fill high the long silver-rimmed buffalo horn: While the roof of the hall by our chorus is torn, Fill, fill to the brim, the deep silver-rimmed horn. THE SONG OF THE FOUR WINDS. This poem is a specimen of a numerous class of ancient Welsh poems, in which each stanza begins with a repetition of the predominant idea, and terminates with a proverb, more or less applicable to the subject. In some poems, the sequency of the main images is regular and connected, and the proverbial terminations strictly appropriate: in others, the sequency of the main images is loose and incoherent, and the proverbial termination has little or nothing to do with the subject of the stanza. The basis of the poem in the text is in the Englynion of Llwyarch Hên. Wind from the north: the young spring day Is pleasant on the sunny mead; The merry harps at evening play; The dance gay youths and maidens lead: The thrush makes chorus from the thorn: The mighty drinker fills his horn. Wind from the east: the shore is still; The mountain-clouds fly tow'rds the sea; The ice is on the winter-rill; The great hall fire is blazing free: The prince's circling feast is spread: Drink fills with fumes the brainless head. Wind from the south: in summer shade 'Tis sweet to hear the loud harp ring; Sweet is the step of comely maid, Who to the bard a cup doth bring: The black crow flies where carrion lies: Where pignuts lurk, the swine will work. Wind from the west: the autumnal deep Rolls on the shore its billowy pride: He, who the rampart's watch must keep, Will mark with awe the rising tide: The high springtide, that bursts its mound, May roll o'er miles of level ground. Wind from the west: the mighty wave Of ocean bounds o'er rock and sand; The foaming surges roar and rave Against the bulwarks of the land: When waves are rough, and winds are high, Good is the land that's high and dry. Wind from the west: the storm-clouds rise; The breakers rave; the whirlblasts roar; The mingled rage of seas and skies Bursts on the low and lonely shore: When safety's far, and danger nigh, Swift feet the readiest aid supply. Wind from the west— GWYDDNAU EI CANT, PAN DDOAI Y MOR DROS CANTREV Y GWAELAWD. A SONG OF GWYTHNO GARANHIR, ON THE INUNDATION OF THE SEA OVER THE PLAIN OF GWAELOD. Stand forth, Seithenyn: winds are high: Look down beneath the lowering sky; Look from the rock: what meets thy sight? Nought but the breakers rolling white. Stand forth, Seithenyn: winds are still: Look from the rock and heathy hill For Gwythno's realm: what meets thy view? Nought but the ocean's desert blue. Curst be the treacherous mound, that gave A passage to the mining wave: Curst be the cup, with mead-froth crowned, That charmed from thought the trusted mound. A tumult, and a cry to heaven! The white surf breaks; the mound is riven: Through the wide rift the ocean-spring Bursts with tumultuous ravaging. The western ocean's stormy might Is curling o'er the rampart's height: Destruction strikes with want and scorn Presumption, from abundance born. The tumult of the western deep Is on the winds, affrighting sleep: It thunders at my chamber-door; It bids me wake, to sleep no more. The tumult of the midnight sea Swells inland, wildly, fearfully: The mountain-caves respond its shocks Among the unaccustomed rocks. The tumult of the vext sea-coast Rolls inland like an armed host: It leaves, for flocks and fertile land, But foaming waves and treacherous sand. The wild sea rolls where long have been Glad homes of men, and pastures green: To arrogance and wealth succeed Wide ruin and avenging need. Seithenyn, come: I call in vain: The high of birth and weak of brain Sleeps under ocean's lonely roar Between the rampart and the shore. The eternal waste of waters, spread Above his unrespected head, The blue expanse, with foam besprent, Is his too glorious monument. ANOTHER SONG OF GWYTHNO. I love the green and tranquil shore; I hate the ocean's dizzy roar, Whose devastating spray has flown High o'er the monarch's barrier-stone. Sad was the feast, which he who spread Is numbered with the inglorious dead; The feast within the torch-lit hall, While stormy breakers mined the wall. To him repentance came too late: In cups the chatterer met his fate: Sudden and sad the doom that burst On him and me, but mine the worst. I love the shore, and hate the deep: The wave has robbed my nights of sleep: The heart of man is cheered by wine; But now the wine-cup cheers not mine. The feast, which bounteous hands dispense, Makes glad the soul, and charms the sense: But in the circling feast I know The coming of my deadliest foe. Blest be the rock, whose foot supplied A step to them that fled the tide; The rock of bards, on whose rude steep I bless the shore, and hate the deep. DYHUDDIANT ELFFIN. THE CONSOLATION OF ELPHIN. Lament not, Elphin: do not measure By one brief hour thy loss or gain: Thy weir tonight has borne a treasure, Will more than pay thee years of pain. St. Cynllo's aid will not be vain: Smooth thy bent brow, and cease to mourn: Thy weir will never bear again Such wealth as it tonight has borne. The stormy seas, the silent rivers, The torrents down the steeps that spring, Alike of weal or woe are givers, As pleases heaven's immortal king. Though frail I seem, rich gifts I bring, Which in Time's fulness shall appear, Greater than if the stream should fling Three hundred salmon in thy weir. Cast off this fruitless sorrow, loading With heaviness the unmanly mind: Despond not; mourn not; evil boding Creates the ill it fears to find. When fates are dark, and most unkind Are they who most should do thee right, Then wilt thou know thine eyes were blind To thy good fortune of tonight. Though, small and feeble, from my coracle To thee my helpless hands I spread, Yet in me breathes a holy oracle To bid thee lift thy drooping head. When hostile steps around thee tread, A spell of power my voice shall wield, That, more than arms with slaughter red, Shall be thy refuge and thy shield. CANU Y MEDD. THE MEAD SONG OF TALIESIN. The King of kings upholds the heaven, And parts from earth the billowy sea: By Him all earthly joys are given; He loves the just, and guards the free. Round the wide hall, for thine and thee, With purest draughts the mead-horns foam, Maelgon of Gwyneth! Can it be That here a prince bewails his home? The bee tastes not the sparkling draught Which mortals from his toils obtain; That sends, in festal circles quaffed, Sweet tumult through the heart and brain. The timid, while the horn they drain, Grow bold; the happy more rejoice; The mourner ceases to complain; The gifted bard exalts his voice. To royal Elphin life I owe, Nurture and name, the harp, and mead: Full, pure, and sparkling be their flow, The horns to Maelgon's lips decreed: For him may horn to horn succeed, Till, glowing with their generous fire, He bid the captive chief be freed, Whom at his hands my songs require. Elphin has given me store of mead, Mead, ale, and wine, and fish, and corn; A happy home; a splendid steed, Which stately trappings well adorn. Tomorrow be the auspicious morn That home the expected chief shall lead; So may King Maelgon drain the horn In thrice three million feasts of mead. SONG OF THE WIND. This poem has little or nothing of Taliesin's Canu y Gwynt, with the exception of the title. That poem is apparently a fragment; and, as it now stands, is an incoherent and scarcely-intelligible rhapsody. It contains no distinct or explicit idea, except the proposition that it is an unsafe booty to carry off fat kine, which may be easily conceded in a case where nimbleness of heel, both in man and beast, must have been of great importance. The idea from which, if from any thing in the existing portion of the poem, it takes its name, that the whispers of the wind bring rumours of war from Deheubarth, is rather implied than expressed. The winds that wander far and free, Bring whispers from the shores they sweep; Voices of feast and revelry; Murmurs of forests and the deep; Low sounds of torrents from the steep Descending on the flooded vale; And tumults from the leaguered keep, Where foes the dizzy rampart scale. The whispers of the wandering wind Are borne to gifted ears alone; For them it ranges unconfined, And speaks in accents of its own. It tells me of Deheubarth's throne; The spider weaves not in its shield: The spider weaving in suspended armour, is an old emblem of peace and inaction. Thus Bacchylides, in his fragment on Peace: ?? ?? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ???? ????????. Euripides, in a fragment of Erechtheus: ?????? ???? ??? ????? ??????????? ????????/. And Nonnus, whom no poetical image escaped: (Dionysiaca, L. xxxviii.) ?? ?????, ?? ???? ?????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?????. And Beaumont and Fletcher, in the Wife for a Month: “Would'st thou live so long, till thy sword hung by, And lazy spiders filled the hilt with cobwebs?” A Persian poet says, describing ruins: “The spider spreads the veil in the palace of the Cæsars.” And among the most felicitous uses of this emblem, must never be forgotten Hogarth's cobweb over the lid of the charity-box. Already from its towers is blown The blast that bids the spoiler yield. Ill with his prey the fox may wend, When the young lion quits his lair: Sharp sword, strong shield, stout arm, should tend On spirits that unjustly dare. To me the wandering breezes bear The war-blast from Caer Lleon's brow; The avenging storm is brooding there To which Diganwy's towers shall bow. THE INDIGNATION OF TALIESIN WITH THE BARDS OF MAELGON GWYNETH. False bards the sacred fire pervert, Whose songs are won without desert; Who falsehoods weave in specious lays, To gild the base with virtue's praise. From court to court, from tower to tower, In warrior's tent, in lady's bower, For gold, for wine, for food, for fire, They tune their throats at all men's hire. Their harps reecho wide and far With sensual love, and bloody war, And drunkenness, and flattering lies: Truth's light may shine for other eyes. In palaces they still are found, At feasts, promoting senseless sound: He is their demigod at least, Whose only virtue is his feast. They love to talk; they hate to think; All day they sing; all night they drink: No useful toils their hands employ; In boisterous throngs is all their joy. The bird will fly, the fish will swim, The bee the honied flowers will skim; Its food by toil each creature brings, Except false bards and worthless kings. Learning and wisdom claim to find Homage and succour from mankind; But learning's right, and wisdom's due, Are falsely claimed by slaves like you. True bards know truth, and truth will show; Ye know it not, nor care to know: Your king's weak mind false judgment warps; Rebuke his wrong, or break your harps. I know the mountain and the plain; I know where right and justice reign; I from the tower will Elphin free; Your king shall learn his doom from me. A spectre of the marsh shall rise, With yellow teeth, and hair, and eyes, From whom your king in vain aloof Shall crouch beneath the sacred roof. He through the half-closed door shall spy The Yellow Spectre sweeping by; To whom the punishment belongs Of Maelgon's crimes and Elphin's wrongs. [Maid of the rock! though loud the flood] TALIESIN. Maid of the rock! though loud the flood, My voice will pierce thy cell: No foe is in the mountain wood; No danger in the dell: The torrents bound along the glade; Their path is free and bright; Be thou as they, oh mountain maid! In liberty and light. MELANGHEL. The cataracts thunder down the steep; The woods all lonely wave: Within my heart the voice sinks deep That calls me from my cave. The voice is dear, the song is sweet, And true the words must be: Well pleased I quit the dark retreat, To wend away with thee. TALIESIN. Not yet; not yet: let nightdews fall, And stars be bright above, Ere to her long deserted hall I guide my gentle love. When torchlight flashes on the roof, No foe will near thee stray: Even now his parting courser's hoof Rings from the rocky way. MELANGHEL. Yet climb the path, and comfort speak, To cheer the lonely cave, Where woods are bare, and rocks are bleak, And wintry torrents rave. A dearer home my memory knows, A home I still deplore; Where firelight glows, while winds and snows Assail the guardian door. THE WAR-SONG OF DINAS VAWR. The mountain sheep are sweeter, But the valley sheep are fatter; We therefore deemed it meeter To carry off the latter. We made an expedition; We met a host, and quelled it; We forced a strong position, And killed the men who held it. On Dyfed's richest valley, Where herds of kine were brousing, We made a mighty sally, To furnish our carousing. Fierce warriors rushed to meet us; We met them, and o'erthrew them: They struggled hard to beat us; But we conquered them, and slew them. As we drove our prize at leisure, The king marched forth to catch us: His rage surpassed all measure, But his people could not match us. He fled to his hall-pillars; And, ere our force we led off, Some sacked his house and cellars, While others cut his head off. We there, in strife bewild'ring, Spilt blood enough to swim in: We orphaned many children, And widowed many women. The eagles and the ravens We glutted with our foemen; The heroes and the cravens, The spearmen and the bowmen. We brought away from battle, And much their land bemoaned them, Two thousand head of cattle, And the head of him who owned them: Ednyfed, king of Dyfed, His head was borne before us; His wine and beasts supplied our feasts, And his overthrow, our chorus. GORWYNION Y GAUAV. THE BRILLIANCIES OF WINTER. Last of flowers, in tufts around Shines the gorse's golden bloom: Milkwhite lichens clothe the ground 'Mid the flowerless heath and broom: Bright are holly-berries, seen Red, through leaves of glossy green. Brightly, as on rocks they leap, Shine the sea-waves, white with spray; Brightly, in the dingles deep, Gleams the river's foaming way; Brightly through the distance show Mountain-summits clothed in snow. Brightly, where the torrents bound, Shines the frozen colonnade, Which the black rocks, dripping round, And the flying spray have made: Bright the icedrops on the ash Leaning o'er the cataract's dash. Bright the hearth, where feast and song Crown the warrior's hour of peace, While the snow-storm drives along, Bidding war's worse tempest cease; Bright the hearthflame, flashing clear On the up-hung shield and spear. Bright the torchlight of the hall When the wintry night-winds blow; Brightest when its splendours fall On the mead-cup's sparkling flow: While the maiden's smile of light Makes the brightness trebly bright. Close the portals; pile the hearth; Strike the harp; the feast pursue; Brim the horns: fire, music, mirth, Mead and love, are winter's due. Spring to purple conflict calls Swords that shine on winter's walls. AVALLENAU MYRDDIN. MERLIN'S APPLE-TREES. Fair the gift to Merlin given, Apple-trees seven score and seven; Equal all in age and size; On a green hill-slope, that lies Basking in the southern sun, Where bright waters murmuring run. Just beneath the pure stream flows; High above the forest grows; Not again on earth is found Such a slope of orchard ground: Song of birds, and hum of bees, Ever haunt the apple-trees. Lovely green their leaves in spring; Lovely bright their blossoming: Sweet the shelter and the shade By their summer foliage made: Sweet the fruit their ripe boughs hold, Fruit delicious, tinged with gold. Gloyad, nymph with tresses bright, Teeth of pearl, and eyes of light, Guards these gifts of Ceidio's son, Gwendol, the lamented one, Him, whose keen-edged sword no more Flashes 'mid the battle's roar. War has raged on vale and hill: That fair grove was peaceful still. There have chiefs and princes sought Solitude and tranquil thought: There have kings, from courts and throngs, Turned to Merlin's wild-wood songs. Now from echoing woods I hear Hostile axes sounding near: On the sunny slope reclined, Feverish grief disturbs my mind, Lest the wasting edge consume My fair spot of fruit and bloom. Lovely trees, that long alone In the sylvan vale have grown, Bare, your sacred plot around, Grows the once wood-waving ground: Fervent valour guards ye still; Yet my soul presages ill. Well I know, when years have flown, Briars shall grow where ye have grown: Them in turn shall power uproot; Then again shall flowers and fruit Flourish in the sunny breeze, On my new-born apple-trees. THE MASSACRE OF THE BRITONS. Sad was the day for Britain's land, A day of ruin to the free, When Gorthyn Gwrtheyrn: Vortigern. stretched a friendly hand To the dark dwellers of the sea. Hengist and Horsa. But not in pride the Saxon trod, Nor force nor fraud oppressed the brave, Ere the grey stone and flowery sod Closed o'er the blessed hero's grave. Gwrthevyr: Vortimer: who drove the Saxons out of Britain. The twice-raised monarch Vortigern: who was, on the death of his son Vortimer, restored to the throne from which he had been deposed. drank the charm, The love-draught of the ocean-maid: Ronwen: Rowena. Vain then the Briton's heart and arm, Keen spear, strong shield, and burnished blade. “Come to the feast of wine and mead,” Spake the dark dweller of the sea: Hengist. “There shall the hours in mirth proceed; There neither sword nor shield shall be.” Hard by the sacred temple's site, Soon as the shades of evening fall, Resounds with song and glows with light The ocean-dweller's rude-built hall. The sacred ground, where chiefs of yore The everlasting fire adored, The solemn pledge of safety bore, And breathed not of the treacherous sword. The amber wreath his temples bound; His vest concealed the murderous blade; As man to man, the board around, The guileful chief his host arrayed. None but the noblest of the land, The flower of Britain's chiefs, were there: Unarmed, amid the Saxon band, They sate, the fatal feast to share. Three hundred chiefs, three score and three, Went, where the festal torches burned Before the dweller of the sea: They went; and three alone returned. 'Till dawn the pale sweet mead they quaffed: The ocean-chief unclosed his vest; His hand was on his dagger's haft, And daggers glared at every breast. But him, at Eidiol's Eidiol or Emrys: Emrys Wledig: Ambrosius. breast who aimed, The mighty Briton's arm laid low: His eyes with righteous anger flamed; He wrenched the dagger from the foe; And through the throng he cleft his way, And raised without his battle cry; And hundreds hurried to the fray, From towns, and vales, and mountains high. But Briton's best blood dyed the floor Within the treacherous Saxon's hall; Of all, the golden chain who wore, Two only answered Eidiol's call. Then clashed the sword; then pierced the lance; Then by the axe the shield was riven; Then did the steed on Cattraeth prance, And deep in blood his hoofs were driven. Even as the flame consumes the wood, So Eidiol rushed along the field; As sinks the snow-bank in the flood, So did the ocean-rovers yield. The spoilers from the fane he drove; He hurried to the rock-built tower, Where the base king, Vortigern and Rowena. in mirth and love, Sate with his Saxon paramour. Vortigern and Rowena. The storm of arms was on the gate, The blaze of torches in the hall, So swift, that ere they feared their fate, The flames had scaled their chamber wall. They died: for them no Briton grieves; No planted flower above them waves; No hand removes the withered leaves That strew their solitary graves. And time the avenging day brought round That saw the sea-chief vainly sue: To make his false host bite the ground Was all the hope our warrior knew. And evermore the strife he led, Disdaining peace, with princely might, Till, on a spear, the spoiler's Hengist. head Was reared on Caer-y-Cynan's height. THE CAULDRON OF CERIDWEN. The sage Ceridwen was the wife Of Tegid Voël, of Pemble Mere: Two children blest their wedded life, Morvran and Creirwy, fair and dear: Morvran, a son of peerless worth, And Creirwy, loveliest nymph of earth: But one more son Ceridwen bare, As foul as they before were fair. She strove to make Avagddu wise; She knew he never could be fair: And, studying magic mysteries, She gathered plants of virtue rare: She placed the gifted plants to steep Within the magic cauldron deep, Where they a year and day must boil, 'Till three drops crown the matron's toil. Nine damsels raised the mystic flame; Gwion the Little near it stood: The while for simples roved the dame Through tangled dell and pathless wood. And, when the year and day had past, The dame within the cauldron cast The consummating chaplet wild, While Gwion held the hideous child. But from the cauldron rose a smoke That filled with darkness all the air: When through its folds the torchlight broke, Nor Gwion, nor the boy, was there. The fire was dead, the cauldron cold, And in it lay, in sleep uprolled, Fair as the morning-star, a child, That woke, and stretched its arms, and smiled. What chanced her labours to destroy, She never knew; and sought in vain If 'twere her own misshapen boy, Or little Gwion, born again: And, vext with doubt, the babe she rolled In cloth of purple and of gold, And in a coracle consigned Its fortunes to the sea and wind. The summer night was still and bright, The summer moon was large and clear, The frail bark, on the springtide's height, Was floated into Elphin's weir. The baby in his arms he raised: His lovely spouse stood by, and gazed, And, blessing it with gentle vow, Cried “Taliesin!” “Radiant brow!” And I am he: and well I know Ceridwen's power protects me still; And hence o'er hill and vale I go, And sing, unharmed, whate'er I will. She has for me Time's veil withdrawn: The images of things long gone, The shadows of the coming days, Are present to my visioned gaze. And I have heard the words of power, By Ceirion's solitary lake, That bid, at midnight's thrilling hour, Eryri's hundred echoes wake. I to Diganwy's towers have sped, And now Caer Lleon's halls I tread, Demanding justice, now, as then, From Maelgon, most unjust of men. CROTCHET CASTLE. Le monde est plein de fous, et qui n'en veut pas voir, Doit se tenir tout seul, et casser son miroir. [If I drink water while this doth last] If I drink water while this doth last, May I never again drink wine: For how can a man, in his life of a span, Do any thing better than dine? We'll dine and drink, and say if we think That any thing better can be; And when we have dined, wish all mankind May dine as well as we. And though a good wish will fill no dish, And brim no cup with sack, Yet thoughts will spring, as the glasses ring, To illume our studious track. On the brilliant dreams of our hopeful schemes The light of the flask shall shine; And we'll sit till day, but we'll find the way To drench the world with wine. [‘Beyond the sea, beyond the sea] ‘Beyond the sea, beyond the sea, My heart is gone, far, far from me; And ever on its track will flee My thoughts, my dreams, beyond the sea. ‘Beyond the sea, beyond the sea, The swallow wanders fast and free: Oh, happy bird! were I like thee, I, too, would fly beyond the sea. ‘Beyond the sea, beyond the sea, Are kindly hearts and social glee: But here for me they may not be; My heart is gone beyond the sea.’” LLYN-Y-DREIDDIAD-VRAWD. THE POOL OF THE DIVING FRIAR. Gwenwynwyn withdrew from the feasts of his hall; He slept very little, he prayed not at all; He pondered, and wandered, and studied alone; And sought, night and day, the philosopher's stone. He found it at length, and he made its first proof By turning to gold all the lead of his roof: Then he bought some magnanimous heroes, all fire, Who lived but to smite and be smitten for hire. With these, on the plains like a torrent he broke; He filled the whole country with flame and with smoke; He killed all the swine, and he broached all the wine; He drove off the sheep, and the beeves, and the kine; He took castles and towns; he cut short limbs and lives; He made orphans and widows of children and wives: This course many years he triumphantly ran, And did mischief enough to be called a great man. When, at last, he had gained all for which he had striven, He bethought him of buying a passport to heaven; Good and great as he was, yet he did not well know How soon, or which way, his great spirit might go. He sought the grey friars, who, beside a wild stream, Refected their frames on a primitive scheme; The gravest and wisest Gwenwynwyn found out, All lonely and ghostly, and angling for trout. Below the white dash of a mighty cascade, Where a pool of the stream a deep resting-place made, And rock-rooted oaks stretched their branches on high, The friar stood musing, and throwing his fly. To him said Gwenwynwyn, “Hold, father, here's store, For the good of the church, and the good of the poor;” Then he gave him the stone; but, ere more he could speak, Wrath came on the friar, so holy and meek: He had stretched forth his hand to receive the red gold, And he thought himself mocked by Gwenwynwyn the Bold; And in scorn of the gift, and in rage at the giver, He jerked it immediately into the river. Gwenwynwyn, aghast, not a syllable spake; The philosopher's stone made a duck and a drake: Two systems of circles a moment were seen, And the stream smoothed them off, as they never had been. Gwenwynwyn regained, and uplifted, his voice: “Oh friar, grey friar, full rash was thy choice; The stone, the good stone, which away thou hast thrown, Was the stone of all stones, the philosophers' stone!” The friar looked pale, when his error he knew; The friar looked red, and the friar looked blue; And heels over head, from the point of a rock, He plunged, without stopping to pull off his frock. He dived very deep, but he dived all in vain, The prize he had slighted he found not again: Many times did the friar his diving renew, And deeper and deeper the river still grew. Gwenwynwyn gazed long, of his senses in doubt, To see the grey friar a diver so stout: Then sadly and slowly his castle he sought, And left the friar diving, like dabchick distraught. Gwenwynwyn fell sick with alarm and despite, Died, and went to the devil, the very same night: The magnanimous heroes he held in his pay Sacked his castle, and marched with the plunder away. No knell on the silence of midnight was rolled, For the flight of the soul of Gwenwynwyn the Bold: The brethren, unfeed, let the mighty ghost pass, Without praying a prayer, or intoning a mass. The friar haunted ever beside the dark stream; The philosopher's stone was his thought and his dream: And day after day, ever head under heels He dived all the time he could spare from his meals. He dived, and he dived, to the end of his days, As the peasants oft witnessed with fear and amaze: The mad friar's diving-place long was their theme, And no plummet can fathom that pool of the stream. And still, when light clouds on the midnight winds ride, If by moonlight you stray on the lone river-side, The ghost of the friar may be seen diving there, With head in the water, and heels in the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME FIVE GRYLL GRANGE THE DEATH OF PHILEMON. Suidas: sub voce ???????.Apuleius: Florid. 16. I. Closed was Philemon's hundredth year: The theatre was thronged to hear His last completed play: In the mid scene, a sudden rain Dispersed the crowd—to meet again On the succeeding day. He sought his home, and slept, and dreamed, Nine maidens through his door, it seemed, Passed to the public street. He asked them, “Why they left his home?” They said, “A guest will hither come, We must not stay to meet.” He called his boy with morning light, Told him the vision of the night, And bade his play be brought. His finished page again he scanned, Resting his head upon his hand, Absorbed in studious thought. He knew not what the dream foreshowed: That nought divine may hold abode Where death's dark shade is felt: And therefore were the Muses nine Leaving the old poetic shrine, Where they so long had dwelt. II. The theatre was thronged once more, More thickly than the day before, To hear the half-heard song. The day wore on. Impatience came. They called upon Philemon's name, With murmurs loud and long. Some sought at length his studious cell, And to the stage returned, to tell What thousands strove to ask. “The poet we have been to seek Sate with his hand upon his cheek, As pondering o'er his task. “We spoke. He made us no reply. We reverentially drew nigh, And twice our errand told. He answered not. We drew more near: The awful mystery then was clear: We found him stiff and cold. “Struck by so fair a death, we stood Awhile in sad admiring mood; Then hastened back, to say That he, the praised and loved of all, Is deaf for ever to your call: That on this self-same day, “When here presented should have been The close of his fictitious scene, His life's true scene was o'er: We seemed, in solemn silence awed, To hear the ‘Farewell and applaud,’ Which he may speak no more. “Of tears the rain gave prophecy: The nuptial dance of comedy Yields to the funeral train. Assemble where his pyre must burn: Honour his ashes in their urn: And on another day return To hear his songs again.” THE DAPPLED PALFREY. Founded on Le Vair Palefroi: among the Fabliaux published by Barbazan. “My traitorous uncle has wooed for himself: Her father has sold her for land and for pelf: My steed, for whose equal the world they might search, In mockery they borrow to bear her to church. “Oh! there is one path through the forest so green, Where thou and I only, my palfrey, have been: We traversed it oft, when I rode to her bower To tell my love tale through the rift of the tower. “Thou know'st not my words, but thy instinct is good: By the road to the church lies the path through the wood: Thy instinct is good, and her love is as true: Thou wilt see thy way homeward: dear palfrey, adieu.” They feasted full late and full early they rose, And church-ward they rode more than half in a doze: The steed in an instant broke off from the throng, And pierced the green path, which he bounded along. In vain was pursuit, though some followed pell-mell: Through bramble and thicket they floundered and fell. On the backs of their coursers some dozed as before, And missed not the bride till they reached the church-door. The knight from his keep on the forest-bound gazed: The drawbridge was down, the portcullis was raised: And true to his hope came the palfrey amain, With his only loved lady, who checked not the rein. The drawbridge went up: the portcullis went down: The chaplain was ready with bell, book, and gown: The wreck of the bride-train arrived at the gate: The bride showed the ring, and they muttered “Too late!” “Not too late for a feast, though too late for a fray: What's done can't be undone: make peace while you may:” So spake the young knight, and the old ones complied, And quaffed a deep health to the bridegroom and bride. LOVE AND AGE. I played with you 'mid cowslips blowing, When I was six and you were four; When garlands weaving, flower-balls throwing, Were pleasures soon to please no more. Through groves and meads, o'er grass and heather, With little playmates, to and fro, We wandered hand in hand together; But that was sixty years ago. You grew a lovely roseate maiden, And still our early love was strong; Still with no care our days were laden, They glided joyously along; And I did love you, very dearly, How dearly words want power to show; I thought your heart was touched as nearly; But that was fifty years ago. Then other lovers came around you, Your beauty grew from year to year, And many a splendid circle found you The centre of its glittering sphere. I saw you then, first vows forsaking, On rank and wealth your hand bestow; Oh, then I thought my heart was breaking,— But that was forty years ago. And I loved on, to wed another: No cause she gave me to repine; And when I heard you were a mother, I did not wish the children mine. My own young flock, in fair progression, Made up a pleasant Christmas row: My joy in them was past expression;— But that was thirty years ago. You grew a matron plump and comely, You dwelt in fashion's brightest blaze; My earthly lot was far more homely; But I too had my festal days. No merrier eyes have ever glistened Around the hearth-stone's wintry glow, Than when my youngest child was christened:— But that was twenty years ago. Time passed. My eldest girl was married, And I am now a grandsire grey; One pet of four years old I've carried Among the wild-flowered meads to play. In our old fields of childish pleasure, Where now, as then, the cowslips blow, She fills her basket's ample measure,— And that is not ten years ago. But though first love's impassioned blindness Has passed away in colder light, I still have thought of you with kindness, And shall do, till our last good-night. The ever-rolling silent hours Will bring a time we shall not know, When our young days of gathering flowers Will be an hundred years ago. A NEW ORDER OF CHIVALRY. I. Sir Moses, Sir Aaron, Sir Jamramajee, Two stock-jobbing Jews, and a shroffing Parsee, Have girt on the armour of old Chivalrie, And, instead of the Red Cross, have hoisted Balls Three. Now fancy our Sovereign, so gracious and bland, With the sword of Saint George in her royal right hand, Instructing this trio of marvellous Knights In the mystical meanings of Chivalry's rites. “You have come from the bath, all in milk-white array, To show you have washed worldly feelings away, And, pure as your vestments from secular stain, Renounce sordid passions and seekings for gain. “This scarf of deep red o'er your vestments I throw, In token, that down them your life-blood shall flow, Ere Chivalry's honour, or Christendom's faith, Shall meet, through your failure, or peril or scaith. “These slippers of silk, of the colour of earth, Are in sign of remembrance of whence you had birth; That from earth you have sprung, and to earth you return, But stand for the faith, life immortal to earn. “This blow of the sword, on your shoulder-blades true, Is the mandate of homage, where homage is due, And the sign, that your swords from the scabbard shall fly, When ‘St. George and the Right’ is the rallying cry. “This belt of white silk, which no speck has defaced, Is the sign of a bosom with purity graced, And binds you to prove, whatsoever betides, Of damsels distressed the friends, champions, and guides. “These spurs of pure gold are the symbols which say, As your steeds obey them, you the Church shall obey, And speed at her bidding, through country and town, To strike, with your faulchions, her enemies down.” II. Now fancy these Knights, when the speech they have heard, As they stand, scarfed, shoed, shoulder-dubbed, belted and spurred, With the cross-handled sword duly sheathed on the thigh, Thus simply and candidly making reply: “By your majesty's grace we have risen up Knights, But we feel little relish for frays and for fights: There are heroes enough, full of spirit and fire, Always ready to shoot and be shot at for hire. “True, with bulls and with bears we have battled our cause; But the bulls have no horns, and the bears have no paws; And the mightiest blow which we ever have struck, Has achieved but the glory of laming a duck. In Stock Exchange slang, Bulls are speculators for a rise, Bears for a fall. A lame duck is a man who cannot pay his differences, and is said to waddle off. The patriotism of the money-market is well touched by Ponsard, in his comedy La Bourse; Acte IV. Scène 3:— ALFRED. Quand nous sommes vainqueurs, dire qu'on a baissé! Si nous étions battus, on aurait donc haussé? DELATOUR. On a craint qu'un succès, si brillant pour la France, De la paix qu'on rêvait n'éloignât l'espérance. ALFRED. Cette Bourse, morbleu! n'a donc rien dans le cœur! Ventre affamé n'a point d'oreilles . . . pour l'honneur! Aussi je ne veux plus jouer—qu'après ma noce— Et j'attends Waterloo pour me mettre à la hausse. “With two nations in arms, friends impartial to both, To raise each a loan we shall be nothing loth; We will lend them the pay, to fit men for the fray; But shall keep ourselves carefully out of the way. “We have small taste for championing maids in distress: For State we care little: for Church we care less: To Premium and Bonus our homage we plight: ‘Percentage!’ we cry: and ‘A fig for the right!’ “'Twixt Saint George and the Dragon, we settle it thus: Which has scrip above par, is the Hero for us: For a turn in the market, the Dragon's red gorge Shall have our free welcome to swallow Saint George.” Now God save our Queen, and if aught should occur, To peril the crown, or the safety of her, God send that the leader, who faces the foe, May have more of King Richard than Moses and Co. [Wake, Gryllus, and arise in human form.] CIRCE. Wake, Gryllus, and arise in human form. GRYLLUS. I have slept soundly, and had pleasant dreams. CIRCE. I, too, have soundly slept. Divine how long. GRYLLUS. Why, judging by the sun, some fourteen hours. CIRCE. Three thousand years. GRYLLUS. That is a nap, indeed. But this is not your garden, nor your palace. Where are we now? CIRCE. Three thousand years ago, This land was forest, and a bright pure river Ran through it to and from the Ocean stream. Now, through a wilderness of human forms, And human dwellings, a polluted flood Rolls up and down, charged with all earthly poisons, Poisoning the air in turn. GRYLLUS. I see vast masses Of strange unnatural things. CIRCE. Houses, and ships, And boats, and chimneys vomiting black smoke, Horses, and carriages of every form, And restless bipeds, rushing here and there For profit or for pleasure, as they phrase it. GRYLLUS. Oh, Jupiter and Bacchus! what a crowd, Flitting, like shadows without mind or purpose, Such as Ulysses saw in Erebus. But wherefore are we here? CIRCE. There have arisen Some mighty masters of the invisible world, And these have summoned us. GRYLLUS. With what design? CIRCE. That they themselves must tell. Behold they come, Carrying a mystic table, around which They work their magic spells. Stand by, and mark. Three spirit-rappers appeared, carrying a table, which they placed on one side of the stage: 1. Carefully the table place, Let our gifted brother trace A ring around the enchanted space. 2. Let him tow'rd the table point, With his first fore-finger joint, And, with mesmerized beginning, Set the sentient oak-slab spinning. 3. Now it spins around, around, Sending forth a murmuring sound, By the initiate understood As of spirits in the wood. ALL. Once more Circe we invoke. CIRCE. Here: not bound in ribs of oak, Nor, from wooden disk revolving, In strange sounds strange riddles solving, But in native form appearing, Plain to sight, as clear to hearing. THE THREE. Thee with wonder we behold. By thy hair of burning gold, By thy face with radiance bright, By thine eyes of beaming light, We confess thee, mighty one, For the daughter of the Sun. On thy form we gaze appalled. CIRCE. Gryllus, too, your summons called. THE THREE. Him of yore thy powerful spell Doomed in swinish shape to dwell: Yet such life he reckoned then Happier than the life of men. Now, when carefully he ponders All our scientific wonders, Steam-driven myriads, all in motion, On the land and on the ocean, Going, for the sake of going, Wheresoever waves are flowing, Wheresoever winds are blowing; Converse through the sea transmitted, Swift as ever thought has flitted; All the glories of our time, Past the praise of loftiest rhyme; Will he, seeing these, indeed, Still retain his ancient creed, Ranking, in his mental plan, Life of beast o'er life of man? CIRCE. Speak, Gryllus. GRYLLUS. It is early yet to judge: But all the novelties I yet have seen Seem changes for the worse. THE THREE. If we could show him Our triumphs in succession, one by one, 'Twould surely change his judgment: and herein How might'st thou aid us, Circe! CIRCE. I will do so: And calling down, like Socrates of yore, The Clouds to aid us, they shall shadow forth, In bright succession, all that they behold, From air, on earth and sea. I wave my wand: And lo! they come, even as they came in Athens, Shining like virgins of ethereal life. The Chorus of Clouds descended, and a dazzling array of female beauty was revealed by degrees through folds of misty gauze. They sang their first choral song: CHORUS OF CLOUDS. I Clouds ever-flowing, conspicuously soaring,The first stanza is pretty closely adapted from the strophe of Aristophanes: ?????? ???????. The second is only a distant imitation of the antistrophe: ???????? ??????????. From loud-rolling Ocean, whose stream In Homer, and all the older poets, the ocean is a river surrounding the earth, and the seas are inlets from it. gave us birth, To heights, whence we look over torrents down-pouring To the deep quiet vales of the fruit-giving earth,— As the broad eye of Æther, unwearied in brightness, Dissolves our mist-veil in its glittering rays, Our forms we reveal from its vapoury lightness, In semblance immortal, with far-seeing gaze. II Shower-bearing Virgins, we seek not the regions Whence Pallas, the Muses, and Bacchus have fled, But the city, where Commerce embodies her legions, And Mammon exalts his omnipotent head. All joys of thought, feeling, and taste are before us, Wherever the beams of his favour are warm: Though transient full oft as the veil of our chorus, Now golden with glory, now passing in storm. CHORUS. I As before the pike will fly Dace and roach and such small fry; As the leaf before the gale, As the chaff beneath the flail; As before the wolf the flocks, As before the hounds the fox; As before the cat the mouse, As the rat from falling house; As the fiend before the spell Of holy water, book, and bell; As the ghost from dawning day,— So has fled, in gaunt dismay, This septemvirate of quacks, From the shadowy attacks Of Cœur-de-Lion's battle-axe. II Could he in corporeal might, Plain to feeling as to sight, Rise again to solar light, How his arm would put to flight All the forms of Stygian night, That round us rise in grim array, Darkening the meridian day: Bigotry, whose chief employ Is embittering earthly joy; Chaos, throned in pedant state, Teaching echo how to prate; And “Ignorance, with looks profound,” Not “with eye that loves the ground,” But stalking wide, with lofty crest, In science's pretentious vest. III And now, great masters of the realms of shade, To end the task which called us down from air, We shall present, in pictured show arrayed, Of this your modern world the triumphs rare, That Gryllus's benighted spirit May wake to your transcendent merit, And, with profoundest admiration thrilled, He may with willing mind assume his place In your steam-nursed, steam-borne, steam-killed, And gas-enlightened race. CIRCE. Speak, Gryllus, what you see. GRYLLUS. I see the ocean, And o'er its face ships passing wide and far; Some with expanded sails before the breeze, And some with neither sails nor oars, impelled By some invisible power against the wind, Scattering the spray before them. But of many One is on fire, and one has struck on rocks And melted in the waves like fallen snow. Two crash together in the middle sea, And go to pieces on the instant, leaving No soul to tell the tale; and one is hurled In fragments to the sky, strewing the deep With death and wreck. I had rather live with Circe Even as I was, than flit about the world In those enchanted ships, which some Alastor Must have devised as traps for mortal ruin. CIRCE. Look yet again. GRYLLUS. Now the whole scene is changed. I see long trains of strange machines on wheels, With one in front of each, puffing white smoke From a black hollow column. Fast and far They speed, like yellow leaves before the gale, When autumn winds are strongest. Through their windows I judge them thronged with people; but distinctly Their speed forbids my seeing. SPIRIT-RAPPER. This is one Of the great glories of our modern time. “Men are become as birds,” and skim like swallows The surface of the world. GRYLLUS. For what good end? SPIRIT-RAPPER. The end is in itself—the end of skimming The surface of the world. GRYLLUS. If that be all, I had rather sit in peace in my old home: But while I look, two of them meet and clash, And pile their way with ruin. One is rolled Down a steep bank; one through a broken bridge Is dashed into a flood. Dead, dying, wounded, Are there as in a battle-field. Are these Your modern triumphs? Jove preserve me from them. SPIRIT-RAPPER. These ills are rare. Millions are borne in safety Where one incurs mischance. Look yet again. GRYLLUS. I see a mass of light brighter than that Which burned in Circe's palace, and beneath it A motley crew dancing to joyous music. But from that light explosion comes, and flame; And forth the dancers rush in haste and fear From their wide-blazing hall. SPIRIT-RAPPER. Oh, Circe! Circe! Thou show'st him all the evil of our arts In more than just proportion to the good. Good without evil is not given to man. Jove, from his urns dispensing good and ill, Gives ill unmixed to some, and good and ill Mingled to many—good unmixed to none. This is the true sense of the Homeric passage:— ????? ??? ?? ????? ??????????? ?? ???? ????? ?????, ??? ??????, ?????, ?????? ?? ????? ?? ??? ???????? ??? ???? ?????????????, ?????? ??? ?? ???? ??? ???????, ?????? ?? ?????. ?? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ???, ??????? ?????, ??? ? ???? ?????????? ??? ????? ???? ???????? ????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????, ???? ?????????. Homer: Il. xxiv. There are only two distributions: good and ill mixed, and unmixed ill. None, as Heyne has observed, receive unmixed good. Ex dolio bonorum nemo meracius accipit: hoc memorare omisit. This sense is implied, not expressed. Pope missed it in his otherwise beautiful translation. Two urns by Jove's high throne have ever stood, The source of evil one, and one of good: From thence the cup of mortal man he fills, Blessings to these, to those distributes ills, To most he mingles both: the wretch decreed To taste the bad, unmixed, is curst indeed: Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven, He wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven. Pope. Our arts are good. The inevitable ill That mixes with them, as with all things human, Is as a drop of water in a goblet Full of old wine. GRYLLUS. More than one drop, I fear, And those of bitter water. CIRCE. There is yet An ample field of scientific triumph: What shall we show him next? SPIRIT-RAPPER. Pause we awhile. He is not in the mood to feel conviction Of our superior greatness. He is all For rural comfort and domestic ease, But our impulsive days are all for moving: Sometimes with some ulterior end, but still For moving, moving, always. There is nothing Common between us in our points of judgment. He takes his stand upon tranquillity, We ours upon excitement. There we place The being, end, and aim of mortal life. The many are with us: some few, perhaps, With him. We put the question to the vote By universal suffrage. Aid us, Circe! On talismanic wings your spells can waft The question and reply. Are we not wiser, Happier, and better, than the men of old, Of Homer's days, of Athens, and of Rome? VOICES WITHOUT. Aye. No. Aye, aye. No. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. We are the wisest race the earth has known, The most advanced in all the arts of life, In science, and in morals. SPIRIT-RAPPER. The Ayes have it. What is that wondrous sound, that seems like thunder, Mixed with gigantic laughter? CIRCE. It is Jupiter, Who laughs at your presumption; half in anger, And half in mockery. Now, my worthy masters, You must in turn experience in yourselves The mighty magic thus far tried on others. CIRCE. Now, Gryllus, we may seek our ancient home In my enchanted isle. GRYLLUS. Not yet, not yet. Good signs are toward of a joyous supper. Therein the modern world may have its glory, And I, like an impartial judge, am ready To do it ample justice. But, perhaps, As all we hitherto have seen are shadows, So too may be the supper. CIRCE. Fear not, Gryllus. That you will find a sound reality, To which the land and air, seas, lakes, and rivers, Have sent their several tributes. Now, kind friends, Who with your smiles have graciously rewarded Our humble but most earnest aims to please, And with your presence at our festal board Will charm the winter midnight, Music gives The signal: Welcome and old wine await you. THE CHORUS. Shadows to-night have offered portraits true Of many follies which the world enthral. “Shadows we are, and shadows we pursue:” But in the banquet's well-illumined hall, Realities, delectable to all, Invite you now our festal joy to share. Could we our Attic prototype recal, One compound word should give our bill of fare: As at the end of the Ecclesiazusæ. But where our language fails, our hearts true welcome bear. THE LEGEND OF SAINT LAURA. Saint Laura, in her sleep of death, Preserves beneath the tomb —'Tis willed where what is will must be— Vuolsi così colà dove si puote Ciò che si vuole, e più non domandare. Dante. In incorruptibility Her beauty and her bloom. So pure her maiden life had been, So free from earthly stain, 'Twas fixed in fate by Heaven's own Queen, That till the earth's last closing scene She should unchanged remain. Within a deep sarcophagus Of alabaster sheen, With sculptured lid of roses white, She slumbered in unbroken night, By mortal eyes unseen. Above her marble couch was reared A monumental shrine, Where cloistered sisters, gathering round, Made night and morn the aisle resound With choristry divine. The abbess died: and in her pride Her parting mandate said, They should her final rest provide, The alabaster couch beside, Where slept the sainted dead. The abbess came of princely race: The nuns might not gainsay: And sadly passed the timid band, To execute the high command They dared not disobey. The monument was opened then: It gave to general sight The alabaster couch alone: But all its lucid substance shone With præternatural light. They laid the corpse within the shrine: They closed its doors again: But nameless terror seemed to fall, Throughout the live-long night, on all Who formed the funeral train. Lo! on the morrow morn, still closed The monument was found: But in its robes funereal drest, The corpse they had consigned to rest Lay on the stony ground. Fear and amazement seized on all: They called on Mary's aid: And in the tomb, unclosed again, With choral hymn and funeral train, The corpse again was laid. But with the incorruptible Corruption might not rest: The lonely chapel's stone-paved floor Received the ejected corpse once more, In robes funereal drest. So was it found when morning beamed: In solemn suppliant strain The nuns implored all saints in heaven, That rest might to the corpse be given, Which they entombed again. On the third night a watch was kept By many a friar and nun: Trembling, all knelt in fervent prayer, Till on the dreary midnight air Rolled the deep bell-toll, “One!” The saint within the opening tomb Like marble statue stood: All fell to earth in deep dismay: And through their ranks she passed away, In calm unchanging mood. No answering sound her footsteps raised Along the stony floor: Silent as death, severe as fate, She glided through the chapel gate, And none beheld her more. The alabaster couch was gone: The tomb was void and bare: For the last time, with hasty rite, Even 'mid the terror of the night, They laid the abbess there. 'Tis said, the abbess rests not well In that sepulchral pile: But yearly, when the night comes round, As dies of “One” the bell's deep sound She flits along the aisle. But whither passed the virgin saint, To slumber far away, Destined by Mary to endure, Unaltered in her semblance pure, Until the judgment day? None knew, and none may ever know: Angels the secret keep: Impenetrable ramparts bound, Eternal silence dwells around, The chamber of her sleep.</field>

Longinus. TO THE REVIEWERS: A CENTO, FROM THE WORKS OF SHAKESPEAR Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approv'd good masters, With all my love I do commend me to you: And now, good friends, when you shall judgment join In censure of my seeming, I beseech you, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor aught set down in malice. Note you this: Time has not sow'd a grizzle on my face: The golden mark I seek to hit, is not To look quite through the deeds of men, and shew The very age and body of the time Its form and pressure. With a simple wreath, Cull'd from the book and volume of my brain, I come before you. Yet alas! methinks I hear a voice cry: “horrible! most horrible! Ye Gods! how vilely does this cynic rhyme! Oh! he's as tedious as a twice-told tale, Worse than the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag!” Though all that I can do is little worth With your displeasure piec'd, my good intent May carry through itself: no levell'd malice Infects one comma in the course I hold. Under your good correction, if I speed, And my invention thrive, then will I say, Your love deserves my thanks: so farewell, gentlemen. PALMYRA Palmyra is situated under a barren ridge of hills to the west, and open on its other sides to the desert. It is about six days journey from Aleppo, and as many from Damascus, and about twenty leagues west of the Euphrates, in the latitude of thirty-four degrees, according to Ptolemy. Some geographers have placed it in Syria, others in Phœnicia, and some in Arabia. Wood's Ruins of Palmyra. That Solomon built Tadmor in the wilderness, we are told in the Old Testament; and that this was the same city which the Greeks and Romans called afterwards Palmyra, though the Syrians retained the first name, we learn from Josephus. Ibid. We departed from Aleppo on Michaelmas day, 1691, and in six easy days travel over a desert-country, came to Tadmor. . . . Having past by the ruins of a handsome mosque, we had the prospect of such magnificent ruins, that if it be lawful to frame a conjecture of the original beauty of that place by what is still remaining, I question whether any city in the world could have challenged precedence of this in its glory. —Philosophical Transactions, Lowthorp's Abridgement, Vol. III. On the fourteenth of March, 1751, we arrived at the end of the plain, where the hills to our right and left seemed to meet. We found between those hills a vale, through which an aqueduct, now ruined, formerly conveyed water to Palmyra. In this vale, to our right and left, were several square towers of a considerable height, which, upon a nearer approach, we found were the sepulchres of the ancient Palmyrenes. We had scarcely passed these venerable monuments, when the hills opening discovered to us, all at once, the greatest quantity of ruins we had ever seen, all of white marble, and beyond them, towards the Euphrates, a flat waste, as far as the eye could reach, without any object which shewed either life or motion. It is scarcely possible to imagine any thing more striking than this view: so great a number of Corinthian pillars, mixed with so little wall or solid building, afforded a most romantic variety of prospect. Wood. Undoubtedly the effect of such a sight is not to be communicated. The reader must represent to himself a range of erect columns, occupying an extent of more than twenty-six hundred yards, and concealing a multitude of other edifices behind them. In this space we sometimes find a palace of which nothing remains but the courts and walls; sometimes a temple whose peristyle is half thrown down; and now a portico, a gallery, or triumphal arch. Here stand groups of columns, whose symmetry is destroyed by the fall of many of them; there we see them ranged in rows of such length, that similar to rows of trees, they deceive the sight, and assume the appearance of continued walls. If from this striking scene we cast our eyes upon the ground, another, almost as varied, presents itself; on all sides we behold nothing but subverted shafts, some entire, others shattered to pieces, or dislocated in their joints; and on which side soever we look, the earth is strewed with vast stones half buried, with broken entablatures, damaged capitals, mutilated frizes, disfigured reliefs, effaced sculptures, violated tombs, and altars defiled by dust.

As the mountain-torrent rages, Loud, impetuous, swift, and strong, So the rapid stream of ages Rolls with ceaseless tide along. Man's little day what clouds o'ercast! How soon his longest date is past! All-conqu'ring Death, in solemn state unfurl'd, Comes, like the burning desert-blast, And sweeps him from the world. The noblest works of human pow'r In vain resist the fate-fraught hour; The marble hall, the rock-built tow'r, Alike submit to destiny: Oblivion's awful storms resound; The massy columns fall around; The fabric totters to the ground, And darkness veils its memory!

I have adopted this pronunciation, as more poetical than Tedmor or Tadmor. expand, Where Desolation, on the blasted plain, Has fix'd his adamantine throne, I mark, in silence and alone, His melancholy reign. These silent wrecks, more eloquent than speech, Full many a tale of awful note impart; Truths more sublime than bard or sage can teach This pomp of ruin presses on the heart. Whence rose that dim, mysterious sound, That breath'd in hollow murmurs round? As sweeps the gale Along the vale, Where many a mould'ring tomb is spread, Awe-struck, I hear, In fancy's ear, The voices of th' illustrious dead: As slow they pass along, they seem to sigh, “Man, and the works of man, are only born to die!” III. As scatter'd round, a dreary space, Ye spirits of the wise and just! In reverential thought I trace The mansions of your sacred dust, Enthusiast Fancy, rob'd in light, Pours on the air her many-sparkling rays, Redeeming from Oblivion's deep'ning night The deeds of ancient days. The mighty forms of chiefs of old, To Virtue dear, and Patriot Truth sublime, In feeble splendor I behold, Discover'd dimly through the mists of Time, As through the vapours of the mountain-stream With pale reflection glows the sun's declining beam. IV. Still as twilight's mantle hoary Spreads progressive on the sky, See, in visionary glory, Darkly-thron'd, they sit on high. But whose the forms, oh Fame, declare, That crowd majestic on the air? Bright Goddess! come, on rapid wings, To tell the mighty deeds of kings. Where art thou, Fame? Each honor'd name From thy eternal roll unfold: Awake the lyre, In songs of fire, To chiefs renown'd in days of old. I call in vain! The welcome strain Of praise to them no more shall sound: Their actions bright Must sleep in night, Till Time shall cease his mystic round. The dazzling glories of their day The stream of years has swept away; Their names, that struck the foe with fear, Shall ring no more on mortal ear! V. Yet faithful Memory's raptur'd eye Can still the godlike form descry, At the time when the East trembled at the name of Sapor, he received a present not unworthy of the greatest kings; a long train of camels, laden with the most rare and valuable merchandises. The rich offering was accompanied by an epistle, respectful but not servile, from Odenathus, one of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra. “Who is this Odenathus” (said the haughty victor, and he commanded that the presents should be cast into the Euphrates), “that he thus insolently presumes to write to his lord? If he entertain a hope of mitigating his punishment, let him fall prostrate before the foot of our throne, with his hands bound behind his back. Should he hesitate, swift destruction shall be poured on his head, on his whole race, and on his country.” The desperate extremity to which the Palmyrenian was reduced, called into action all the latent powers of his soul. He met Sapor; but he met him in arms. Infusing his own spirit into a little army, collected from the villages of Syria, and the tents of the desert, he hovered round the Persian host, harassed their retreat, carried off part of the treasure, and, what was dearer than any treasure, several of the women of the Great King, who was at last obliged to repass the Euphrates, with some marks of haste and confusion. By this exploit, Odenathus laid the foundation of his future fame and fortunes. The majesty of Rome, oppressed by a Persian, was protected by a Syrian or Arab of Palmyra. Gibbon. Of him, who, on Euphrates' shore, From Sapor's brow his blood-stain'd laurels tore, And bade the Roman banner stream unfurl'd; When the stern Genius of the startling waves Beheld on Persia's host of slaves Tumultuous ruin hurl'd! Meek Science too, and Taste refin'd, The grave with deathless flow'rs have dress'd, Of him whose virtue-kindling mind Longinus. Their ev'ry charm supremely bless'd; Who trac'd the mazy warblings of the lyre With all a critic's art, and all a poet's fire. VI. Where is the bard, in these degen'rate days, To whom the muse the blissful meed awards, Again the dithyrambic song to raise, And strike the golden harp's responsive chords? Be his alone the song to swell, The all-transcendent praise to tell Of yon immortal form, That bursting through the veil of years, In changeless majesty appears, Bright as the sun-beams thro' the scatt'ring storm! What countless charms around her rise! Aurelian had no sooner secured the person and provinces of Tetricus, than he turned his arms against Zenobia, the celebrated queen of Palmyra and the East. Modern Europe has produced several illustrious women who have sustained with glory the weight of empire, nor is our own age destitute of such distinguished characters. But Zenobia is perhaps the only female, whose superior genius broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by the climate and manners of Asia. She claimed her descent from the Macedonian kings of Egypt, equalled in beauty her ancestor Cleopatra, and far surpassed that princess in chastity and valour. Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely, as well as the most heroic of her sex. She was of a dark complexion (for in speaking of a lady these trifles become important). Her teeth were of a pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes sparkled with uncommon fire, tempered by the most attractive sweetness. Her voice was strong and harmonious. Her manly understanding was strengthened and adorned by study. She was not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but possessed in equal perfection the Greek, the Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn up for her own use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly compared the beauties of Homer and Plato, under the tuition of the sublime Longinus. Gibbon. If we add to this her uncommon strength, and consider her excessive military fatigues, for she used no carriage, generally rode, and often marched on foot three or four miles with her army; and if we at the same time suppose her haranguing her soldiers, which she used to do in a helmet, and often with her arms bare, it will give us an idea of that severe character of masculine beauty, which puts one more in mind of Minerva than Venus. Wood. What dazzling splendor sparkles in her eyes! On her radiant brow enshrin'd, Minerva's beauty blends with Juno's grace; The matchless virtues of her godlike mind Are stamp'd conspicuous on her angel-face. VII. Hail, sacred shade, to Nature dear! Though sorrow clos'd thy bright career, Though clouds obscur'd thy setting day, Thy fame shall never pass away! Long shall the mind's unfading gaze Retrace thy pow'r's meridian blaze, When o'er Arabian deserts, vast and wild, And Egypt's land, (where Reason's wakeful eye First on the birth of Art and Science smil'd, And bade the shades of mental darkness fly) And o'er Assyria's many-peopled plains, By Justice led, thy conqu'ring armies pour'd, When humbled nations kiss'd thy silken chains, Or fled dismay'd from Zabdas' Zenobia's general. victor-sword: Yet vain the hope to share the purple robe, From the time of Adrian to that of Aurelian, for about 140 years, this city continued to flourish, and increase in wealth and power, to that degree, that when the Emperor Valerian was taken prisoner by Sapor, King of Persia, Odenathus, one of the Lords of this town, was able, whilst Gallienus neglected his duty both to his father and his country, to bring a powerful army into the field, and to recover Mesopotamia from the Persians, and to penetrate as far as their capital city Ctesiphon. Thereby rendering so considerable a service to the Roman state, that Gallienus thought himself obliged to give him a share in the empire: of which action Trebellius Pollio, in the Life of Gallienus, has these words: Laudatur ejus (Gallieni) optimum factum, qui Odenatum participato imperio Augustum vocavit, ejusque monetam, quæ Persas captos traheret, cudi jussit; quod et Senatus et Urbs et omnis ætas gratanter accepit. The same, in many places, speaks of this Odenathus with great respect; and mentioning his death, he says: Iratum fuisse Deum Reipublicæ credo, qui interfecto Valeriano noluit Odenatum reservare. But by a strange reverse of fortune, this honor and respect to Odenathus occasioned the sudden ruin and subversion of the city. For he and his son Herodes being murdered by Mæonius, their kinsman, and dying with the title of Augustus, his wife Zenobia, in right of her son Vaballathus then a minor, pretended to take upon her the government of the east, and did administer it to admiration: and when, soon after, Gallienus was murdered by his soldiers, she grasped the government of Egypt, and held it during the short reign of the Emperor Claudius Gothicus. But Aurelian, coming to the imperial dignity, would not suffer the title of Augustus in this family, though he was contented that they should hold under him as vice Cæsaris, as plainly appears by the Latin coins, of Aurelian on the one side, and Vaballathus on the other, with these letters, V. C. R. IM. OR; which P. Harduin has most judiciously interpreted, Vice Cæsaris Rector Imperii Orientis, without the title of Cæsar or Augustus, and with a laurel instead of a diadem. But both Vaballathus and Zenobia are styled ???????? in the Greek coins, made, it is probable, within their own jurisdiction. But nothing less than a participation of the empire contenting Zenobia, and Aurelian persisting not to have it dismembered, he marched against her; and having in two battles routed her forces, he shut her up and besieged her in Palmyra, and the besieged finding that the great resistance they made availed not against that resolute emperor, they yielded the town; and Zenobia flying with her son was pursued and taken; with which Aurelian being contented spared the city, and marched for Rome with this captive lady; but the inhabitants, believing he would not return, set up again for themselves, and, as Vopiscus has it, slew the garrison he had left in the place. Which Aurelian understanding, though by this time he was gotten into Europe, with his usual fierceness, speedily returned, and collecting a sufficient army by the way, he again took the city without any great opposition, and put it to the sword with uncommon cruelty (as he himself confesses in a letter extant in Vopiscus), and delivered it to the pillage of his soldiers.

Along the wild and wasted plain His vet'ran bands the Roman monarch led, And roll'd his burning wheels o'er heaps of slain: The prowling chacal heard afar The devastating yell of war, And rush'd, with gloomy howl, to banquet on the dead! IX. For succour to Palmyra's walls Her trembling subjects fled, confounded, But wide amid her regal halls The whirling fires resounded. Onward the hostile legions pour'd: Nor beauteous youth, nor helpless age, The following is the letter of Aurelian above alluded to: ... Aurelianus Augustus Ceionio Basso: Non oportet ulterius progredi militum gladios, jam satis Palmyrenorum cæsum atque occisum est. Mulieribus non pepercimus, infantes occidimus, senes jugulavimus, rusticos interemimus, cui terras, cui urbem, deinceps relinquemus? Parcendum est iis qui remanserunt. Credimus enim paucos tam multorum suppliciis esse correctos. Templum sanè solis, quod apud Palmyram aquilifer legionis tertiæ cum vexilliferis et draconario cornicinibus atque liticinibus diripuerunt, ad eam formam volo, quæ fuit, reddi. Habes trecentas auri libras Zenobiæ capsulis: habes argenti mille octingenta pondo e Palmyrenorum bonis: habes gemmas regias. Ex his omnibus fac cohonestari templum: mihi et diis immortalibus gratissimum feceris. Ego ad Senatum scribam, petens ut mittet pontificem, qui dedicet templum. Nor female charms, by savage breasts ador'd, Could check the Roman's barb'rous rage, Or blunt the murd'rous sword. Loud, long, and fierce, the voice of slaughter roar'd, The night-shades fell, the work of death was o'er, Palmyra's sun had set, to rise no more! X. What mystic form, uncouth and dread, With wither'd cheek, and hoary head, Swift as the death-fire cleaves the sky, Swept on sounding pinions by? 'Twas Time: I know the Foe of Kings, His scythe, and sand, and eagle wings: He cast a burning look around, And wav'd his bony hand, and frown'd. Far from the spectre's scowl of fire Fancy's feeble forms retire, Her air-born phantoms melt away, Like stars before the rising day. XI. Yes, all are flown! I stand alone, At ev'ning's calm and pensive hour, Mid wasted domes, And mould'ring tombs, The wrecks of vanity and pow'r. One shadowy tint enwraps the plain; No form is near, no sounds intrude, To break the melancholy reign Of silence and of solitude. How oft, in scenes like these, since Time began, With downcast eye has Contemplation trod, Far from the haunts of Folly, Vice, and Man, To hold sublime communion with her God! How oft, in scenes like these, the pensive sage Has mourn'd the hand of Fate, severely just, War's wasteful course, and Death's unsparing rage, And dark Oblivion, frowning in the dust! Has mark'd the tombs, that king's o'erthrown declare, Just wept their fall, and sunk to join them there! XII. In yon proud fane, Architecture more especially lavished her ornaments, and displayed her magnificence, in the temple of the sun, the tutelar deity of Palmyra. The square court which enclosed it was six hundred and seventy-nine feet each way, and a double range of columns extended all round the inside. In the middle of the vacant space, the temple presents another front of forty-seven feet by one hundred and twenty-four in depth, and around it runs a peristyle of one hundred and forty columns. Volney. majestic in decay, How oft of old the swelling hymn arose, In loud thanksgiving to the Lord of Day, Or pray'r for vengeance on triumphant foes! 'Twas there, ere yet Aurelian's hand Had kindled Ruin's smould'ring brand, As slowly mov'd the sacred choir Around the altar's rising fire, The priest, with wild and glowing eye, Bade the flow'r-bound victim die; And while he fed the incense-flame, With many a holy mystery, Prophetic inspiration came To teach th' impending destiny, And shook his venerable frame With most portentous augury! In notes of anguish, deep and slow, He told the coming hour of woe; The youths and maids, with terror pale, In breathless torture heard the tale, And silence hung On ev'ry tongue, While thus the voice prophetic rung: XIII. “Whence was the hollow scream of fear, Whose tones appall'd my shrinking ear? Whence was the modulated cry, That seem'd to swell, and hasten by? What sudden blaze illum'd the night? Ha! 'twas Destruction's meteor-light! Whence was the whirlwind's eddying breath? Ha! 'twas the fiery blast of Death! XIV. “See! the mighty God of Battle Spreads abroad his crimson train! Discord's myriad voices rattle O'er the terror-shaken plain. Banners stream, and helmets glare, Show'ring arrows hiss in air; Echoing through the darken'd skies, Wildly-mingling murmurs rise, The clash of splendor-beaming steel, The buckler ringing hollowly, The cymbal's silver-sounding peal, The last deep groan of agony, The hurrying feet Of wild retreat, The length'ning shout of victory! XV. “O'er our plains the vengeful stranger Pours, with hostile hopes elate: Who shall check the coming danger? Who escape the coming fate? Thou! that through the heav'ns afar, When the shades of night retire, Proudly roll'st thy shining car, Clad in sempiternal fire! Thou! from whose benignant light Fiends of darkness, strange and fell, Urge their ebon-pinion'd flight To the central caves of hell! Sun ador'd! attend our call! Must thy favor'd people fall? Must we leave our smiling plains, To groan beneath the stranger's chains? Rise, supreme in heav'nly pow'r, On our foes destruction show'r; Bid thy fatal arrows fly, Till their armies sink and die; Through their adverse legions spread Pale Disease, and with'ring Dread, Wild Confusion's fev'rish glare, Horror, Madness, and Despair! XVI. “Woe to thy numbers fierce and rude, Woe to the multitude of many people, that make a noise like the noise of the seas, and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind. Isaiah, c. xvii. Thou madly-rushing multitude, Loud as the tempest that o'er ocean raves! Woe to the nations proud and strong, That rush tumultuously along, As rolls the foaming stream its long-resounding waves! As the noise of mighty seas, As the loudly-murmuring breeze, Shall gath'ring nations rush, a pow'rful band: Rise, God of Light, in burning wrath severe, And stretch, to blast their proud career, Thy arrow-darting hand! Then shall their ranks to certain fate be giv'n, Then on their course Despair her fires shall cast, Then shall they fly, to endless ruin driv'n, As flies the thistle-down before the mountain-blast! XVII. “Alas! in vain, in vain we call! The stranger triumphs in our fall! And Fate comes on, with ruthless frown, To strike Palmyra's splendor down. Urg'd by the steady breath of Time, The desert-whirlwind sweeps sublime, The eddying sands in mountain-columns rise: Borne on the pinions of the gale, In one concenter'd cloud they sail, Along the darken'd skies. It falls! it falls! on Thedmor's walls The whelming weight of ruin falls! Th' avenging thunder-bolt is hurl'd, Her pride is blotted from the world, Her name unknown in story: The trav'ller on her scite shall stand, And seek, amid the desert-sand, The records of her glory! Her palaces are crush'd, her tow'rs o'erthrown, Oblivion follows stern, and marks her for his own!” XVIII. How oft, the festal board around, These time-worn walls among, Has rung the full symphonious sound Of rapture-breathing song! Ah! little thought the wealthy proud, When rosy pleasure laugh'd aloud, That here, amid their ancient land, The wand'rer of the distant days Should mark, with sorrow-clouded gaze, The mighty wilderness of sand; While not a sound should meet his ear, Save of the desert-gales that sweep, In modulated murmurs deep, The wasted graves above, Of those who once had revell'd here, In happiness and love! XIX. Short is the space to man assign'd This earthly vale to tread; He wanders, erring, weak, and blind, By adverse passions led. Love, the balm of ev'ry woe, The dearest blessing man can know; Jealousy, whose pois'nous breath Blasts affection's op'ning bud; Stern Despair, that laughs in death; Black Revenge, that bathes in blood; Fear, that his form in darkness shrouds, And trembles at the whisp'ring air; And Hope, that pictures on the clouds Celestial visions, false, but fair; All rule by turns: To-day he burns With ev'ry pang of keen distress; To-morrow's sky Bids sorrow fly With dreams of promis'd happiness. XX. From the earliest twilight-ray, That mark'd Creation's natal day, Till yesterday's declining fire, Thus still have roll'd, perplex'd by strife, The many-clashing wheels of life, And still shall roll, till Time's last beams expire. And thus, in ev'ry age, in ev'ry clime, While circling years shall fly, The varying deeds that mark the present time Will be but shadows of the days gone by. XXI. Along the desolated shore, Where, broad and swift, Euphrates flows, The trav'ller's anxious eye can trace no more The spot where once the Queen of Cities Babylon. rose. Where old Persepolis sublimely tow'r'd, In cedar-groves embow'r'd, A rudely-splendid wreck alone remains. The course of Fate no pomp or pow'r can shun. Pollution tramples on thy giant-fanes, Oh City of the Sun! Balbec, the Heliopolis of the Greeks and Romans. Fall'n are the Tyrian domes of wealth and joy, The hundred gates of Thebes, the tow'rs of Troy; In shame and sorrow pre-ordain'd to cease, Proud Salem met th' irrevocable doom; In darkness sunk the arts and arms of Greece, And the long glories of imperial Rome. XXII. When the tyrant's iron hand The mountain-piles of Memphis rais'd, That still the storms of angry Time defy, In self-adoring thought he gaz'd, And bade the massive labors stand, Till Nature's self should die! Presumptuous fool! the death-wind came, And swept away thy worthless name; And ages, with insidious flow, Shall lay those blood-bought fabrics low. Then shall the stranger pause, and oft be told, “Here stood the mighty Pyramids of old!” And smile, half-doubtful, when the tale he hears, That speaks the wonders of the distant years. XXIII. Though Night awhile usurp the skies, Yet soon the smiling Morn shall rise, And light and life restore; Again the sun-beams gild the plain; Let clouds rest on the hills, spirits fly, and travellers fear. Let the winds of the woods arise, the sounding storms descend. Roar streams, and windows flap, and green-winged meteors fly; rise the pale moon from behind her hills, or enclose her head in clouds; night is alike to me, blue, stormy, or gloomy the sky. Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds, but we return no more. Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of mighty name? The fields of their battles are silent; scarce their mossy tombs remain. We shall also be forgotten. This lofty house shall fall. Our sons shall not behold the ruins in grass. They shall ask of the aged, “Where stood the walls of our fathers?”—See the beautiful little poem of The Bards in the notes on Ossian's Croma. Raise, ye bards, said the mighty Fingal, the praise of unhappy Moina. Call her ghost, with your songs, to our hills; that she may rest with the fair of Morven, the sun-beams of other days, and the delight of heroes of old. I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate. The fire had resounded in the halls: the voice of the people was heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its place, by the fall of the walls. The thistle shook, there, its lonely head: the moss whistled to the wind. The fox looked out from the windows, the rank grass of the wall waved round his head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina, silence is in the house of her fathers. Raise the song of mourning, oh bards, over the land of strangers. They have but fallen before us: for, one day, we must fall. Why dost thou build the hall, son of the winged days? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a few years, and the blast of the desert comes; it howls in thy empty court, and whistles round thy half-worn shield. Ossian. The youthful day returns again, But man returns no more. Though Winter's frown severe Deform the wasted year, Spring smiles again, with renovated bloom; But what sweet Spring, with genial breath, Shall chase the icy sleep of death, The dark and cheerless winter of the tomb? Hark! from the mansions of the dead, What thrilling sounds of deepest import spread! Sublimely mingled with the eddying gale, Full on the desert-air these solemn accents sail: XXIV. “Unthinking man! and dost thou weep, That clouds o'ercast thy little day? That Death's stern hands so quickly sweep Thy ev'ry earthly hope away? Thy rapid hours in darkness flow, But well those rapid hours employ, And they shall lead from realms of woe To realms of everlasting joy. For though thy Father and thy God Wave o'er thy head his chast'ning rod, Benignantly severe, Yet future blessings shall repair, In tenfold measure, ev'ry care, That marks thy progress here. XXV. “Bow then to Him, for He is Good, And loves the works his hands have made; In earth, in air, in fire, in flood, His parent-bounty shines display'd. Bow then to Him, for He is Just, Though mortals scan his ways in vain; Repine not, children of the dust! For He in mercy sends ye pain. Bow then to Him, for He is Great, And was, ere Nature, Time, and Fate, Began their mystic flight; And still shall be, when consummating flame Shall plunge this universal frame In everlasting night. Bow then to Him, the Lord of All, Whose nod bids empires rise and fall, Earth, Heav'n, and Nature's Sire; To Him, who, matchless and alone, Has fix'd in boundless space his throne, Unchang'd, unchanging still, while worlds and suns expire!” THE VISIONS OF LOVE Senza l'amabile Dio di Citera, I di non tornano Di primavera; Non spira un zeffiro, Non spunta un fior. Metastasio. To chase the clouds of life's tempestuous hours, To strew its short but weary way with flow'rs, New hopes to raise, new feelings to impart, And pour celestial balsam on the heart; For this to man was lovely woman giv'n, The last, best work, the noblest gift of Heav'n. At Eden's gate, as ancient legends say, The flaming sword for ever bars the way; Not ours to taste the joys our parents shar'd, But pitying Nature half our loss repair'd, Our wounds to heal, our murmurs to remove, She left mankind the Paradise of Love. All-conqu'ring Love! thy pow'rful reign surrounds Man's wildest haunts, and earth's remotest bounds: Alike for thee th' untainted bosom glows 'Mid eastern sands and hyperborean snows: Thy darts unerring fly with strong controul, Tame the most stern, and nerve the softest soul, Check the swift savage of the sultry zone, And bend the monarch on his glitt'ring throne. When wakeful Memory bids the mind explore The half-hid deeds of years that are no more, How few the scenes her hand can picture there Of heart-felt bliss untroubled by a care! Yet many a charm can pow'rful Fancy raise, To point the smiling path of future days; There too will Hope her genial influence blend, Faithless, but kind; a flatt'rer, but a friend. But most to cheer the lover's lonely hours, Creative Fancy wakes her magic pow'rs; Most strongly pours, by ardent love refin'd, Her brightest visions on the youthful mind. Hence, when at eve with lonely steps I rove The flow'r-enamell'd plain or dusky grove, Or press the bank with grassy tufts o'erspread, Where the brook murmurs o'er its pebbly bed; Then steals thy form, Rosalia, on my sight, In artless charms pre-eminently bright: By Hope inspir'd, my raptur'd thoughts engage To trace the lines of Fate's mysterious page; At once in air, the past, the present, fade; In fairy-tints the future stands display'd; No clouds arise, no shadows intervene, To veil or dim the visionary scene. Within the sacred altar's mystic shade, I see thee stand, in spotless white array'd; I hear thee there thy home, thy name resign, I hear the awful vow that seals thee mine. Not on my birth propitious Fortune smil'd, Nor proud Ambition mark'd me for her child; For me no dome with festal splendor shines; No pamper'd lacquies spread their length'ning lines; No venal crowds my nod obsequious wait; No summer-friends besiege my narrow gate; Joys such as these, if joys indeed they be, Indulgent Nature ne'er design'd for me: I ask them not: she play'd a kinder part: She gave a nobler gift, Rosalia's heart. The simple dwelling, by affection rear'd; The smiling plains, by calm content endear'd; The classic book-case, deck'd with learning's store, Rich in historic truth, and bardic lore; The garden-walks, in Nature's liv'ry dress'd; Will these suffice to make Rosalia bless'd? And will she never feel a wish to roam Beyond the limits of our rural home? How sweet, when Spring has crown'd, by genial show'rs, The woods with verdure, and the fields with flow'rs, When fleeting Summer holds his burning reign, Or fruitful Autumn nods with golden grain, With thee, dear girl, each well-known path to tread, Where blooming shrubs their richest odors shed, With thee to mark the seasons' bright career, The varied blessings of the rip'ning year. When frost-crown'd Winter binds the earth in chains, And pours his snow-storms on the whit'ning plains, Then shall the pow'r of constant Love be found, To chase the deep'ning gloom that low'rs around. Beside the cheerful fire's familiar blaze, Shall Memory trace the deeds of long-past days; Of those propitious hours when first I strove To win thy gentle ear with tales of love, When, while thy angel-blushes half-conceal'd The kind consent thy bashful smiles reveal'd, From those bright eyes a soft expression stole, That spoke the silent language of the soul. Or haply then the poet's song may cheer The dark death-season of th' accomplish'd year: Together then we'll roam the sacred plain, Where the bright Nine in ceaseless glory reign; By Homer led, through Trojan battles sweep; With Virgil cleave the tempest-beaten deep; Trace the bold flights of Shakespear's muse of fire; Strike the wild chords of Gray's enraptur'd lyre; From Milton learn with holy zeal to glow; Or weep with Ossian o'er a tale of woe. Nor less shall Music charm: her pow'r sublime Shall oft beguile the ling'ring steps of Time: Then, as I watch, while my Rosalia sings, Her seraph fingers sweep the sounding strings, In soft response to sorrow's melting lay, Or joy's loud swell, that steals our cares away, My heart shall vibrate to the heav'nly sound, And bless the stars our mutual fates that bound. And oft, when darkness veils the stormy skies, Beneath our roof shall Friendship's voice arise; On ev'ry breast her sacred influence pour'd, Shall crown with gen'rous mirth our social board; The chosen few, to Taste and Virtue dear, Shall meet a welcome, simple, but sincere. Not from our door, his humble pray'r denied, The friendless man shall wander unsupplied; Ne'er shall the wretch, whom fortune's ills assail, Tell there in vain his melancholy tale: Thy heart, where Nature's noblest feelings glow, Will throb to heal the bending stranger's woe; On mercy's errand wilt thou oft explore The crazy dwellings of the neighb'ring poor, To blunt the stings of want's unsparing rage, To smooth the short and painful path of age, The childless widow's drooping head to raise, And cheer her soul with hopes of better days: For thee the pray'r affliction's child shall frame, And lisping orphans bless Rosalia's name. Soon shall new objects thy affection share, New hopes, new duties claim Rosalia's care. How will thy anxious eye exulting trace The charms and virtues of thy infant-race! Thy tender hand with sense and taste refin'd Shall stamp each impulse of the rip'ning mind, And early teach their little steps to stray Through Virtue's paths, and Wisdom's flow'ry way. Thus may our lives in one smooth tenor flow; Possess'd of thee, I ask no more below. That constant love, which bless'd with genial rays The bright and happy spring-time of our days, Shall still dispel the clouds of woe and strife From the full summer of progressive life. The hand of Time may quench the ardent fire Of rising passion, and of young desire; But that pure flame esteem first taught to burn Can only perish in the silent urn. And when the last, the solemn hour draws near, That bids us part from all that charm'd us here, Then on our thoughts the heav'nly hope shall rise, To meet in higher bliss, in better skies, In those bright mansions of the just above, Where all is Rapture, Innocence, and Love. MARIA'S RETURN TO HER NATIVE COTTAGE Si perda la vita, Finisca il martire; È meglio morire, Che viver così. Metastasio. The whit'ning ground In frost is bound; The snow is swiftly falling; While coldly blows the northern breeze, And whistles through the leafless trees, In hollow sounds appalling. On this cold plain, Now reach'd with pain, Once stood my father's dwelling: Where smiling pleasure once was found, Now desolation frowns around, And wintry blasts are yelling. Hope's visions wild My thoughts beguil'd, My earliest days delighting, Till unsuspected treach'ry came, Beneath affection's specious name, The lovely prospect blighting. With many a wile Of blackest guile Did Henry first deceive me: What winning words to him were giv'n! He swore, by all the pow'rs of Heav'n, That he would never leave me. With fondest truth I lov'd the youth: My soul, to guilt a stranger, Knew not, in those too simple hours, That oft beneath the sweetest flow'rs Is couch'd the deadliest danger. With him to roam I fled my home; I burst the bonds of duty; I thought my days in joy would roll; But Henry hid a demon's soul Beneath an angel's beauty! Shall this poor heart E'er cease to smart? Oh never! never! never! Did av'rice whisper thee, or pride, False Henry! for a wealthier bride To cast me off for ever? My sire was poor: No golden store Had he, no earthly treasure: I only could his griefs assuage, The only pillar of his age, His only source of pleasure. With anguish wild, He miss'd his child, And long in vain he sought her: The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav'n Shall on thy guilty head be driv'n, Thou Disobedient Daughter! I feel his fears, I see his tears, I hear his groans of sadness: My cruel falsehood seal'd his doom: He seems to curse me from the tomb, And fire my brain to madness! Oh! keenly blow, While drifts the snow, The cold nocturnal breezes; On me the gath'ring snow-flakes rest, And colder grows my friendless breast; My very heart-blood freezes! 'Tis midnight deep, And thousands sleep, Unknown to guilt and sorrow; They think not of a wretch like me, Who cannot, dare not, hope to see The rising light to-morrow! An outcast hurl'd From all the world, Whom none would love or cherish, What now remains to end my woes, But here, amid the deep'ning snows, To lay me down and perish? Death's icy dart Invades my heart: Just Heav'n! all-good! all-seeing! Thy matchless mercy I implore, When I must wake, to sleep no more, In realms of endless being! FIOLFAR, KING OF NORWAY A che temer nembi e procelle, E l'usata costanza in oblio porre? Vedrai l'aurette alla tua vela ancelle Spirar dolci e seguaci. Menzini. TERMS OF NORTHERN MYTHOLOGY Dalinger,—day. Hrimfax,—the steed of the evening twilight. Niord,—the god of the sea and wind. Norver,—night. Lok,—the evil principle. Valfander,—a name of Odin. Valhalla,—the hall of Odin. Thor,—the Gothic Mars. Hilda and Mista,—two of the Valkyræ, or fatal sisters. Nilflhil,—the frozen hell of the north. Hela,—the goddess of death. Duergi,—dwarfs. Asgard,—the city of Odin. The passage from this city to the earth is over the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow), on the end of which, nearest Asgard, is stationed the centinel-god Heimdaller, to watch the approach of Surtur, and his attendant genii and giants, from the fiery regions of the south, by whom, in the twilight of the gods, the world is to be consumed. I. In the dark-rolling waves at the verge of the west The steeds of Dalinger had hastened to rest, While Hrimfax advanced through the star-spangled plain, And shook the thick dews from his grey-flowing mane; The moon's silver crescent shone feebly on high, And meteors shot red down the paths of the sky. By the shore of the ocean Fiolfar reclined, Where through the rock-fissures loud murmured the wind, For sweet to his ear was the deep-dashing flow Of the wide-foaming breakers that thundered below. —“Alas!” he exclaimed, “were the hopes of my youth, Though raised by affection, unfounded on truth? Ye are flown, ye sweet prospects, deceitfully fair, As the light-rolling gossamer melts into air; As the wild-beating ocean, with turbulent roar, Effaces my steps on the sands of the shore! Thy waters, oh Niord! tumultuously roll, And such are the passions that war in my soul: Thy meteors, oh Norver! malignantly dart, And such are the death-flames that burn in my heart. Nitalpha! my love! on the hill and the plain, In the vale and the wood, have I sought thee in vain; Through the nations for thee have I carried afar The sun-shine of peace and the tempests of war; Through danger and toil I my heroes have led, Till hope's latest spark in my bosom was dead! Cold, silent, and dark, are the halls of thy sires, And hushed are the harps, and extinguished the fires; The wild autumn-blast in the lofty hall roars, And the yellow leaves roll through the half-open doors. Nitalpha! when rapture invited thy stay, Did force or inconstancy bear thee away? Ah, no! though in vain I thy footsteps pursue, I will not, I cannot, believe thee untrue: Perchance thou art doomed in confinement to moan, To dwell in the rock's dreary caverns alone, And Lok's cruel mandates, while fast thy tears flow, Forbid thy Fiolfar to solace thy woe, Condemn thee unvarying anguish to bear, And leave me a prey to the pangs of despair.”— Ha! whence were those accents, portentous and dread, Like the mystical tones of the ghosts of the dead, In echoes redoubling that rung through the gloom, As the thunder resounds in the vaults of the tomb? —“Fiolfar!”—He started, and wondering descried, That a sable-clad stranger stood tall by his side: Majestic he stood, on the surf-beaten steep, Like a spirit of storms by the roar of the deep: His soul-piercing eyes as the eagle's were bright, And his raven-hair flowed on the breezes of night. —“Fiolfar!” he cried, “thy affliction forsake: To hope and revenge let thy bosom awake; For he, that Nitalpha from liberty tore, Is Lochlin's proud monarch, the bold Yrrodore. Still constant to thee, she the traitor abhorred; Haste! haste! let thy valor her virtue reward: For her let the battle empurple the plain: In the moment of conquest I meet thee again.”— He ceased, and Fiolfar beheld him no more; Nor long paused the youth on the dark-frowning shore: —“Whate'er be thy nature, oh stranger!” he said, “Thou hast called down the tempest on Yrrodore's head: The broad-beaming buckler and keen-biting glaive Shall ring and resound on the fields of the brave, And vengeance shall burst, in a death-rolling flood, And deluge thy altars, Valfander, with blood!”— II. To Loda's dark circle and mystical stone, With the grey-gathered moss of long ages o'ergrown, While the black car of Norver was central in air, Did the harp-bearing bards of Fiolfar repair; The wild-breathing chords, as they solemnly sung, In deep modulations responsively rung; To the hall of Valhalla, where monarchs repose, The full-swelling war-song symphoniously rose: —“From the throne of Skialfa, Valfander, look down, And marshal thy sons in the paths of renown: Be thou too propitious, invincible Thor! And lend thy strong aid to our banners of war. As the torrent, in eddies tumultuously tost, That lately has slumbered in fetters of frost, Descends from the mountain all turbid with snow, Shall Norway rush down on the fields of the foe. Ye spirits of chieftains tremendous in fight, That dwell with Valfander in halls of delight! Awhile from your cloud-circled mansions descend; On the steps of your sons through the conflict attend, When Lochlin shall glow with the beacon's wide beams, And the battle-blast mix with the roar of her streams, And the gaunt raven hover, on dark-flapping wing, To scent his red feast on the foes of our king!”— As full to the wind rose the soul-thrilling tones, Strange murmurs rung wild from the moss-covered stones: The ghosts of the mighty, rejoicing, came forth, And rolled their thin forms on the blasts of the north. On light-flying meteors triumphantly driven, They scattered their signs from the centre of heaven. The skies were all glowing, portentously bright, With strong coruscations of vibrating light: In shadowy forms, on the long-streaming glare, The insignia of battle shot swift through the air; In lines and in circles successively whirled, Fantastical arrows and javelins were hurled, That, flashing and falling in mimic affray, In the distant horizon died darkly away, Where a blood-dropping banner seemed slowly to sail, And expand its red folds to the death-breathing gale. Fiolfar looked forth from his time-honored halls, Where the trophies of battle emblazoned the walls: He heard the faint song, as at distance it swelled, And the blazing of ether with triumph beheld; He saw the white flames inexhaustibly stream, And he knew that his fathers rode bright on the beam, That the spirits of warriors of ages long past Were flying sublime on the wings of the blast. —“Ye heroes!” he cried, “that in danger arose, The bulwark of friends, and the terror of foes; By Odin with glory eternally crowned; By valor and virtue for ever renowned: Like yours may my arm in the conflict be strong, Like yours may my name be recorded in song, And when Hilda and Mista my spirit shall bear The joys of Valhalla with Odin to share, Oh then may you smile on the deeds I have done, And bend forward with joy to acknowledge your son!” — III. The falchion resounded on helm and on shield, For Norway and Lochlin had met in the field; The long lances shivered, the swift arrows flew, The string shrilly twanged on the flexible yew; Rejoicing, the Valkyræ strode through the plain, And guided the death-blow, and singled the slain. Long, long did the virgins of Lochlin deplore The youths whom their arms should encircle no more, For Norway rushed onward, to vengeance awake, With the roar of the ocean, when thunder-clouds break; With the strength of the whirlwind, that shatters the wood, And roots up the oak that for ages has stood; With the storm-swollen torrent's precipitous shock, That hurls from the mountain the frost-loosened rock. Fiolfar through danger triumphantly trod, And scattered confusion and terror abroad: Majestic as Balder, tremendous as Thor, He plunged in the red-foaming torrent of war; Till he mowed his strong course through the ranks of the brave, Where deepened the tumult round Yrrodore's glaive. —“Turn, traitor!” he cried, “thy destruction to prove, Despiser of justice, profaner of love! Already the shades of the guilty await Thy spirit at Hela's implacable gate, Their vigils of winter and darkness to share In Nilflhil's nine worlds of eternal despair.”— Indignantly Yrrodore turned on the foe, And reared his strong arm for a death-dealing blow. He stood, vast in stature, collected in might, As the tower of the hill meets the tempest of night: But the sword of Fiolfar descended to whelm The seven-plated buckler, and plume-waving helm, As the brand of the storm irresistibly falls, And scatters in fragments the rock-founded walls. Swift flowed the black blood, and in anguish he breathed, Yet he muttered these words as expiring he writhed: —“And deemest thou, Fiolfar, the conquest is thine? No! victory, glory, and vengeance, are mine! In triumph I die: thou shalt languish in pain: For ne'er shall Nitalpha delight thee again! The wakeful Duergi the caverns surround, Where in magical slumbers the maiden is bound: Those magical slumbers shall last till the day, When Odin shall summon thy spirit away: Then, then shall she wake to remembrance and pain, To seek her Fiolfar, and seek him in vain, Long years of unvarying sorrow to prove, And weep and lament on the grave of her love!”— He said, and his guilt-blackened spirit went forth, And rushed to the caves of the uttermost north; Still destined to roam through the frost-covered plain, Where Hela has fixed her inflexible reign, Till the tempest of fate shall o'er Asgard be driven In the last lurid gleam of the twilight of heaven, And the trump of Heimdaller tremendously rear The deep-thrilling death-note all nature must hear, And genii and gods, by one ruin enfurled, Contend, and expire, in the flames of the world. IV. Now shone the broad moon on the field of the dead, Where Norway had conquered, and Lochlin had fled: The hoarse raven croaked from the blood-streaming ground: The dead and the dying lay mingled around: The warriors of Norway were sunk in repose, And rushed, in wild visions, again on their foes: Yet lonely and sad did Fiolfar remain Where the monarch of Lochlin had fall'n on the plain; In the silence of sorrow he leaned on his spear, For Yrrodore's words echoed still in his ear: When, with hope-breathing wonder, again he descried That the sable-clad stranger stood tall by his side: —“Behold me, Fiolfar: my promise I keep: Nitalpha is fettered in magical sleep: Yet I to thy arms can the maiden restore, And passion and vengeance shall harm her no more.”— —“Strange being! what art thou? thy nature declare.”— —“The name of Nerimnher from mortals I bear: Mid desolate rocks, in a time-hollowed cell, At distance from man and his vices I dwell; But, obedient to Odin, I haste from the shade, When virtue afflicted solicits my aid: For the mystical art to my knowledge is given, That can check the pale moon as she rolls through the heaven, Can strike the dark dwellers of Nilflhil with dread, And breathe the wild verse that awakens the dead. My voice can the spells of thy rival destroy, And recal thy loved maid to existence and joy.”— Long, rugged, and steep, was their desolate way, By the precipice-rock, and the cataract's spray, Where the wild eagle screamed through night's luminous noon, And the storm-shattered cedar spread black to the moon. The dark-tufted pine topped the frost-mantled height: The larch's long tresses waved lonely and light: No vestige of man was impressed on the heath, And the torrent roared deep in its caverns beneath. From the verge of the glen, from the dash of the flood, They pierced the recesses of Deuranil's wood. Through shades, where the yew and the cypress entwined, Their branches funereal, unmoved by the wind, Slow-toiling they passed, till before them arose The caves of Nitalpha's unbreathing repose. A blue-burning vapor shone dim through the gloom, And rolled its thin curls round a rude-fashioned tomb, Where the weary Duergi, by magic constrained, With eyes never closing, their station maintained. Loud shouting they rose when the strangers advanced, But fear chilled their veins, and they paused as entranced, While the mighty Nerimnher, in fate-favored hour, Thus breathed the strong spell that extinguished their power: —“By the hall of Valhalla, where heroes repose, And drink beer and mead from the skulls of their foes; By the virtues of Freyer, and valor of Thor; By the twelve giant sisters, the rulers of war; By the unrevealed accents, in secret expressed, Of old by Valfander to Balder addressed; By the ghosts, in the frost-worlds of Nilflhil that weep; By the mystical serpent, that circles the deep; By the banner of Asgard, now beaming on high, Hence, children of evil! hear, tremble, and fly!”— Loud yelled the Duergi, and sunk from his sight To their caverns of toil in the regions of night: The vapor rolled backward its tremulous wave, And a star-like effulgence illumined the cave, As the tomb burst asunder, and scattered the shade, Where, in death-like entrancement, Nitalpha was laid. Fiolfar sprang forward, and clasped to his breast The maid, cold and pale as the marble she pressed: The kiss of her love broke the spell of the tomb, And bade life and rapture her beauty relume. From the silent embrace, that no tongue may declare, They turned: but Nerimnher no longer was there: The tomb, and the cave, and the forest, were gone: And fresh o'er their cheeks blew the breeze of the dawn, That waved the proud standard, in victory's pride, On the red field of Lochlin where Yrrodore died. MISCELLANIES HENRIETTE Loud and long the church-bells ringing Spread their signals on the air; Tow'rds his Ellen lightly springing, Faithless Edward hastens there. Can he dare to wed another? Can he all his vows forget? Can he truth and conscience smother, And desert his Henriette? Pale remorse my steps attending, Whither can I hope to fly? When shall all my woes have ending? Never, never, till I die! Can the youth who once ador'd me, Can he hear without regret, Death has that repose restor'd me, He has stol'n from Henriette? Brightly smiles the summer-morning On my Edward's nuptial day; While the bells, with joyous warning, Call to love and mirth away. How this wretched heart is throbbing! Ere the ev'ning sun shall set, Death shall ease my bosom's sobbing, Death shall comfort Henriette. Cruel youth, farewell for ever! False as thou hast been to me, Ne'er, till Fate my thread shall sever, Can I turn my thoughts from thee. Guilt and shame thy soul enslaving, Thou mayest weep and tremble yet, When thou seest the willow waving O'er the grave of Henriette! THE OLD MAN'S COMPLAINT On Eternity's confines I stand, And look back on the paths I have trod: I pant for the summoning hand, That shall call me away to my God! My temples are sprinkled with snow; The sands of existence decline; The dwelling is cheerless and low, The dwelling that soon must be mine. No longer beside me are found The forms that of old were so dear; No longer the voices resound, That once were so sweet to mine ear. The wife of my bosom is lost; Long, long, has she sunk into sleep: My boy on the ocean was toss'd, He rests in the caves of the deep. A villain my daughter betray'd; Her home and her father she fled: But Heav'n has in justice repaid The tears he has caus'd me to shed. Her peace and her honor he stole; Abandon'd, despairing, she died: Remorse quickly seiz'd on his soul, And he rests in the grave by her side. Oh! where are the friends of my youth, The lovely, the good, and the brave? All flown to the mansions of Truth! All pass'd through the gates of the grave! On parents, and children, and friends, Have mortality's arrows been driv'n; But swiftly the darkness descends, And my spirit shall join them in Heav'n! ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES PEMBROKE, ESQ. Where yon green tombs their heads promiscuous raise, With tearful eyes let Friendship mark the spot Where Pembroke slumbers. Upright and sincere, For public worth esteem'd, for private lov'd, Approving Virtue smil'd upon his life, And soft eyed sorrow consecrates his urn. Above that spot where rests his honour'd dust, The sportive child may spend his idle hours, Unthinking that the silent form below Was once like him, like him was wont to play, Unknown to care. Thrice happy innocent! Thou too shalt fall, and on thy humble grave Another child, unthinking as thyself, Light as the lark, and rosy as the morn, Shall frolic in his turn. Thus 'tis with man: Like Autumn's leaves the present race decays, Another race succeeds. But after death Shall Virtue live, and live to die no more, In better climes, from mortal eyes retir'd. There, Pembroke, there thy sainted spirit dwells, In everlasting rest; there, far remov'd From all the troubles of the world, enjoys The sure reward of goodness here below, Eternal, boundless happiness above. THE RAIN-BOW The day has pass'd in storms, though not unmix'd With transitory calm. The western clouds, Dissolving slow, unveil the glorious sun, Majestic in decline. The wat'ry east Glows with the many-tinted arch of Heav'n. We hail it as a pledge that brighter skies Shall bless the coming morn. Thus rolls the day, The short dark day of life; with tempests thus, And fleeting sun-shine chequer'd. At its close, When the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties, All commerce with the world, Religion pours Hope's fairy-colors on the virtuous mind, And, like the rain-bow on the ev'ning clouds, Gives the bright promise that a happier dawn Shall chase the night and silence of the grave. ELLEN The marble tomb, in sculptur'd state display'd, Decks the vile earth where wealthy vice is laid; But no vain pomp its hollow splendor throws, Where Beauty, Virtue, Innocence, repose. The cypress tow'rs, the waving willows weep, Where Ellen sleeps the everlasting sleep, Where with a sigh the passing stranger sees The long rank grave-grass bending in the breeze. FAREWELL TO MATILDA Oui, pour jamais Chassons l'image De la volage Que j'adorais. Parny. Matilda, farewell! Fate has doom'd us to part, But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart; No longer is love with my reason at strife, Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life. As together we roam'd, I the passion confess'd, Which thy beauty and virtue had rais'd in my breast; That the passion was mutual thou mad'st me believe, And I thought my Matilda could never deceive. My Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign: Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine: I now scorn thee as much as I lov'd thee before, Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more. Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find, While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind, Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize, Thou art shunn'd by the good, and contemn'd by the wise. Than mine what affection more fervent could be, When I thought ev'ry virtue was center'd in thee? Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain, For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain. Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov'd As that fancied perfection I formerly lov'd, Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul, Could have dimm'd the dear image then stamp'd on my soul. How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade, By Hope's glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray'd! Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain; For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain. Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear, Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere; May he fix thy light passions, now wav'ring as air, Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair! Repent not, Matilda, return not to me: Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be: In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum'd, For Love, once extinguish'd, is never relum'd. MIRA Beneath yon yew-tree's silent shade, Long, tufted grass the spot discloses, Where, low in death untimely laid, Pale Mira's silent form reposes. The plaintive bird, at ev'ning-close, Pours there her softly-mournful numbers; The earth its earliest sweets bestows, To deck the grave where Mira slumbers. There Summer's brightest flow'rs appear; There oft the hollow breeze is swelling; The passing stranger drops a tear On Mira's dark and narrow dwelling. The moralist, with musing eyes, Loves there his pensive steps to measure: “How vain is human pride!” he cries, “How soon is lost each earthly treasure!” “To snatch the fleeting bubble, joy, How weak is ev'ry fond endeavour! We rush to seize the glitt'ring toy; It bursts, it vanishes for ever! “How soon our pleasures pass away! How soon our bliss must yield to sorrow! The friend, with whom we smile to-day, May wither in his shroud to-morrow!” CLONAR AND TLAMIN IMITATED FROM A LITTLE POEM IN MACPHERSON'S NOTES ON OSSIAN “The loves of Clonar and Tlamin were rendered famous in the north by a fragment of a lyric poem still preserved which is ascribed to Ossian. It is a dialogue between Clonar and Tlamin. She begins with a soliloquy, which he overhears.” TLAMIN. Son of Conglas of Imor! thou first in the battle! Oh Clonar, young hunter of dun-sided roes! Where the wings of the wind through the tall branches rattle, Oh, where does my hero on rushes repose? By the oak of the valley, my love, have I found thee, Where swift from the hill pour thy loud-rolling streams; The beard of the thistle flies sportively round thee, And dark o'er thy face pass the thoughts of thy dreams. Thy dreams are of scenes where the war-tempest rages: Tlamin's youthful warrior no dangers appal: Even now, in idea, my hero engages, On Erin's green plains, in the wars of Fingal. Half hid, by the grove of the hill, I retire: Ye blue mists of Lutha! why rise ye between? Why hide the young warrior whose soul is all fire, Oh why hide her love from the eyes of Tlamin? CLONAR. As the vision that flies with the beams of the morning, While fix'd on the mind its bright images prove, So fled the young sun-beam these vallies adorning; Why flies my Tlamin from the sight of her love? TLAMIN. Oh Clonar! my heart will to joy be a stranger, Till thou on our mountains again shalt be seen; Then why wilt thou rush to the regions of danger, Far, far from the love of the mournful Tlamin? CLONAR. The signals of war are from Selma resounding! With morning we rise on the dark-rolling wave: Towards green-vallied Erin our vessels are bounding; I rush to renown, to the fields of the brave! Yet around me when war's hottest thunders shall rattle, Thy form to my soul ever present shall be; And should death's icy hand check my progress in battle, The last sigh of Clonar shall rise but for thee. FOLDATH, IN THE CAVERN OF MOMA FROM THE SAME FOLDATH, ADDRESSING THE SPIRITS OF HIS FATHERS In your presence dark I stand: Spirits of my sires! disclose, Shall my steps, o'er Atha's land, Pass to Ullin of the roes? ANSWER. Thou to Ullin's plains shalt go: There shall rage the battle loud: O'er the fall'n thy fame shall grow, Like the gath'ring thunder-cloud. There thy blood-stain'd sword shall gleam, Till, around while danger roars, Cloncath, the Reflected Beam, Come from Moruth's sounding shores. DREAMS FROM PETRONIUS ARBITER Somnia, quæ mentes ludunt volitantibus umbris, &amp;c. Dreams, which, beneath the hov'ring shades of night, Sport with the ever-restless minds of men, Descend not from the gods. Each busy brain Creates its own. For when the chains of sleep Have bound the weary, and the lighten'd mind Unshackled plays, the actions of the light Become renew'd in darkness. Then the chief, Who shakes the world with war, who joys alone In blazing cities, and in wasted plains, O'erthrown battalions sees, and dying kings, And fields o'erflow'd with blood. The lawyer dreams Of causes, of tribunals, judges, fees. The trembling miser hides his ill-gain'd gold, And oft with joy a buried treasure finds. The eager hunter with his clam'rous dogs Makes rocks and woods resound. The sailor brings His vessel safe to port, or sees it whelm'd Beneath the foaming waves. The anxious maid Writes to her lover, or beholds him near. The dog in dreams pursues the tim'rous hare. The wretch, whom Fortune's iron hand has scourg'd, Finds in his slumbers all his woes reviv'd. PINDAR ON THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN ????? ?????? ?????????, ???.. All-enlight'ning, all-beholding, All-transcending star of day! Why, thy sacred orb enfolding, Why does darkness veil thy ray? On thy life-diffusing splendor These portentous shades that rise, Vain the strength of mortals render, Vain the labors of the wise. Late thy wheels, through ether burning, Roll'd in unexampled light: Mortals mourn thy change, returning In the sable garb of night. Hear, oh Phœbus! we implore thee, By Olympian Jove divine; Phœbus! Thebans kneel before thee, Still on Thebes propitious shine. On thy darken'd course attending, Dost thou signs of sorrow bring? Shall the Summer rains, descending, Blast the promise of the Spring? Or shall War, in evil season, Spread unbounded ruin round? Or the baleful hand of Treason Our domestic joys confound? By the bursting torrent's power, Shall our rip'ning fields be lost? Shall the air with snow-storms lower, Or the soil be bound in frost? Or shall ocean's waves stupendous, Unresisted, unconfin'd, Once again, with roar tremendous, Hurl destruction on mankind? TO A YOUNG LADY, NETTING While those bewitching hands combine, With matchless grace, the silken line, They also weave, with gentle art, Those stronger nets that bind the heart. But soon all earthly things decay: That net in time must wear away: E'en Beauty's silken meshes gay No lasting hold can take: But Beauty, Virtue, Sense, combin'd, (And all these charms in thee are join'd) Can throw that net upon the mind, No human art can e'er unbind, No human pow'r can break. NUGÆ LEVI MOSES Sed quò divitias hæc per tormenta coactas? Cum furor haud dubius, cum sit manifesta phrenesis Ut locuples moriaris egenti vivere fato? Juv.

SLENDER'S LOVE-ELEGY Come, Polyhymnia, heav'nly maid! Oh deign an humble bard to aid, Whose heart in tenfold chains is laid, In Cupid's cage: To Anna's name I strike the string; Thence all my pains and pleasures spring: Yes, I aspire thy praise to sing, Oh sweet Anne Page! The lustre of thy soft blue eyes, Thy lip that with the coral vies, Might bid love's flames the breast surprise Of stoic sage: And cold indeed his heart must be, Who could thy matchless features see, And not at once exclaim, with me, Oh sweet Anne Page! Wealth, pow'r, and splendor, I disown: To them no real joys are known: Thy unaffected charms alone My heart engage: Thou canst alone my bosom fire, Thou canst alone my muse inspire, To thee alone I tune the lyre, Oh sweet Anne Page! Against my passion's fond appeal Should'st thou thy gentle bosom steel, What pow'r the pangs I then should feel Could e'er assuage? To woods, to mountains would I fly; Thy dear lov'd name unceasing sigh, Till thousand echoes should reply: Oh sweet Anne Page! I cannot boast the art sublime, Like some great poets of the time, To sing, in lofty-sounding rhyme, Of amorous rage: But Love has taught me to complain; Love has inspir'd this humble strain; Then let me not still sigh in vain, Oh sweet Anne Page! A FRAGMENT [Nay, deem me not insensible, Cesario] Nay, deem me not insensible, Cesario, To female charms; nor think this heart of mine Is cas'd in adamant; because, forsooth, I cannot ogle, and hyperbolise, And whisper tender nothings in the ear Of ev'ry would-be beauty, holding out The bright but treach'rous flame of flattery, To watch the she-moths of a drawing-room Sport round the beam, and burn their pretty wings, Ere conscious of their danger: yet, believe me, I love a maid whose untranscended form Is yet less lovely than her spotless mind. With modest frankness, unaffected genius, Unchang'd good-humour, beauty void of art, And polish'd wit that seeks not to offend, And winning smiles that seek not to betray, She charms the sight, and fascinates the soul. Where dwells this matchless nymph? alas, Cesario! 'Tis but a sickly creature of my fancy, Unparallell'd in nature. STANZAS WRITTEN AT SEA Thou white-rolling sea! from thy foam-crested billows, That restlessly flash in the silver moon-beam, In fancy I turn to the green-waving willows, That rise by the side of my dear native stream. There softly in moonlight soft waters are playing, Which light-breathing zephyrs symphoniously sweep; While here the loud wings of the north-wind are swaying, And whirl the white spray of the wild-dashing deep. Sweet scenes of my childhood! with tender emotion, Kind memory, still wakeful, your semblance pourtrays: And I sigh, as I turn from the wide-beating ocean To the paths where I roamed in my infantine days. In fancy before me the pine-boughs are waving, Beneath whose deep canopy musing I strayed; In crystalline waters their image is laving, And the friends of my bosom repose in their shade. Ye fair-spreading fields, which fertility blesses! Ye rivers, that murmur with musical chime! Ye groves of dark pine, in whose sacred recesses The nymph of romance holds her vigils sublime! Ye heath-mantled hills, in lone wildness ascending! Ye vallies, true mansions of peace and repose! Ever green be your shades, nature's children defending, Where liberty sweetens what labor bestows. Oh blest, trebly blest, is the peasant's condition! From courts and from cities reclining afar, He hears not the summons of senseless ambition, The tempests of ocean, and tumults of war. Round the standard of battle though thousands may rally When the trumpet of glory is pealing aloud, He dwells in the shade of his own native valley, And turns the same earth which his forefathers ploughed. In realms far remote while the merchant is toiling, In search of that wealth he may never enjoy; The land of his foes while the soldier is spoiling, When honor commands him to rise and destroy; Through mountainous billows, with whirlwinds contending, While the mariner bounds over wide-raging seas, Still peace, o'er the peasant her mantle extending, Brings health and content in the sigh of the breeze. And happy, who, knowing the world and its treasures, Far, far from his home its allurements repels, And leaves its vain pomps and fantastical pleasures, For the woodlands where wisdom with solitude dwells. With the follies of custom disdaining compliance, He leaves not his country false riches to find; But content with the blessings of nature and science, He pants for no wealth but the wealth of the mind. The beauties are his of the sweet-blushing morning, The dew-spangled field, and the lark's matin-song: And his are the charms the full forest adorning, When sport the noon-breezes its branches among: And his, sweeter yet, is the twilight of even, When melts the soft ray from the far-flashing floods, And fancy descends from the westerly heaven, To talk with the spirit that sings in the woods. In some hermit vale had kind destiny placed me, 'Mid the silence of nature all lonely and drear, Oh, ne'er from its covert ambition had chaced me, To join the vain crowd in its phrensied career! In the haunts of the forest my fancy is dwelling, In the mystical glade, by the lone river's shore, Though wandering afar where the night-breeze is swelling, And waters unbounded tumultuously roar. I hail thee, dark ocean, in beauty tremendous! I love the hoarse dash of thy far-sounding waves! But he feels most truly thy grandeur stupendous, Who in solitude sits mid thy surf-beaten caves. From thy cliffs and thy caverns, majestic and hoary, Be mine to look forth on thy boundless array; Alone to look forth on thy vast-rolling glory, And hear the deep lessons thy thunders convey. But hope softly whispers, on moon-beams descending:— Despond not, oh mortal! thy sorrows are vain: The heart, which misfortune and absence are rending, Love, friendship, and home, shall enrapture again. Though the night-billows rave to the tempest's commotion, In the mild breath of morning their fury shall cease; And the vessel, long tossed on the storm-troubled ocean, Shall furl her torn sails in the harbour of peace. THE GENIUS OF THE THAMES: A LYRICAL POEM, IN TWO PARTS. PROŒMIUM Sweet was the choral song, When in Arcadian vales, Primeval shepherds twined the Aonian wreath: While in the dying gales, That sighed the shades among, Rapt fancy heard responsive spirits breathe. Dryads and Genii wandered then Amid the haunts of guileless men, As yet unknown to strife: Ethereal beings poured the floods, Dwelt in the ever-waving woods, And filled the varied world with intellectual life. Ah! whither are they flown, Those days of peace and love, So sweetly sung by bards of elder time? When in the startling grove The battle-blast was blown, And misery came, and cruelty, and crime, Far from the desolated hills, Polluted meads, and blood-stained rills, Their guardian genii flew; And through the woodlands, waste and wild, Where erst perennial summer smiled, Infuriate passions prowled, and wintry whirlwinds blew. Yet where light breezes sail Along the sylvan shore, The bard still feels a sacred influence nigh: When the far torrent's roar Floats through the twilight vale, And, echoing low, the forest-depths reply. Nor let the throng his dreams despise, Who to the rural deities From courts and crowds retires: Since human grandeur's proudest scheme Is but the fabric of a dream, A meteor-kindled pile, that, while we gaze, expires.

ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART An autumnal night on the banks of the Thames. Eulogium of the Thames. Characters of several rivers of Great Britain. Acknowledged superiority of the Thames. Address to the Genius of the Thames. View of some of the principal rivers of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. Pre-eminence of the Thames. General character of the river. The port of London. The naval dominion of Britain, and extent of her commerce and navigation. Tradition that an immense forest formerly occupied the site of the metropolis. Episode of a Druid, supposed to have taken refuge in that forest, after the expulsion of the order from Mona. The moonlight rests, with solemn smile, On sylvan shore and willowy isle: While Thames, beneath the imaged beam, Rolls on his deep and silent stream. The wasting wind of autumn sighs: The oak's discolored foliage flies: The grove, in deeper shadow cast, Waves darkly in the eddying blast. All hail, ye breezes, loud and drear, That peal the death-song of the year! Your rustling pinions waft around A voice, that breathes no mortal sound, And in mysterious accents sings The flight of time, the change of things. The seasons pass, in swift career: Storms close, and zephyrs wake, the year: The streams roll on, nor e'er return To fill again their parent urn; But bounteous nature, kindly-wise, Their everlasting flow supplies. Like planets round the central sun, The rapid wheels of being run, By laws, from earliest time pursued, Still changed, still wasted, still renewed. Reflected in the present scene, Return the forms that once have been: The present's varying tints display The colors of the future day. Ye bards, that, in these secret shades, These tufted woods, and sloping glades, Awoke, to charm the sylvan maids, Your soul-entrancing minstrelsy! Say, do your spirits yet delight To rove, beneath the starry night, Along this water's margin bright, Or mid the woodland scenery; And strike, to notes of tender fire, With viewless hands, the shadowy lyre, Till all the wandering winds respire A wildly-awful symphony? Hark! from beneath the aged spray, Where hangs my humbler lyre on high, Soft music fills the woodlands grey, And notes aërial warble by! What flying touch, with elfin spell, Bids its responsive numbers swell? Whence is the deep Æolian strain, That on the wind its changes flings? Returns some ancient bard again, To wake to life the slumbering strings? Or breathed the spirit of the scene The lightly-trembling chords between, Diffusing his benignant power On twilight's consecrated hour? Even now, methinks, in solemn guise, By yonder willowy islet grey, I see thee, sedge-crowned Genius! rise, And point the glories of thy way. Tall reeds around thy temples play Thy hair the liquid crystal gems: Huic deus ipse loci fluvio Tiberinus amœno Populeas inter senior se adtollere frondis Visus: eum tenuis glauco velabat amictu Carbasus, et crinis umbrosa tegebat arundo. Virgilius. The tutelary spirits, that formerly animated the scenes of nature, still continue to adorn the visions of poetry; though they are now felt only as the creatures of imagination, and no longer possess that influence of real existence, which must have imparted many enviable sensations to the mind of the ancient polytheist. Of all these fabulous beings, the Genii and Nymphs of rivers and fountains received the largest portion of human adoration. In them, an enthusiastic fancy readily discerned the agency of powerful and benevolent spirits, diffusing wealth and fertility over the countries they adorned.—“Rivers are worshipped,” says Maximus Tyrius (Dissertatio VIII. ?? ????? ???????? ????????,) “on account of their utility, as the Nile by the Egyptians; or of their beauty, as the Peneus by the Thessalians; or of their magnitude, as the Danube by the Scythians; or of mythological traditions, as the Achelous by the Ætolians; or of particular laws, as the Eurotas by the Spartans; or of religious institutions, as the Ilissus by the Athenians.”— These local divinities are the soul of classical landscape; and their altars, by the side of every fountain, and in the shade of every grove, are its most interesting and characteristic feature. From innumerable passages that might be cited on this subject, it will be sufficient to call to mind that beautiful description of Homer: ?????? ????? ????, ??? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????, ?????????, ???? ????????? ???????, ??? ?????? ??????, ??? ???????, ??? ????????? ???? ????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????? ??????? ??????????? ???? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ?(????? ?? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ???????, ??? ?????? ??????????? ??????. To thee I pour the votive lay, Oh Genius of the silver Thames! The shepherd-youth, on Yarrow braes, Of Yarrow stream has sung the praise, To love and beauty dear: And long shall Yarrow roll in fame, Charm with the magic of a name, And claim the tender tear. Who has not wept, in pastoral lay To hear the maiden's song of woe, Who mourned her lover snatched away, And plunged the sounding surge below? The maid, who never ceased to weep, And tell the winds her tale of sorrow, Till on his breast she sunk to sleep, Beneath the lonely waves of Yarrow. The minstrel oft, at evening-fall, Has leaned on Roxburgh's ruined wall, Where, on the wreck of grandeur past, The wild wood braves the sweeping blast: And while, beneath the embowering shade, Swelled, loud and deep, his notes of flame, Has called the spirits of the glade, To hear the voice of Teviot's fame. While artless love, and spotless truth, Delight the waking dreams of youth; While nature's beauties, softly-wild, Are dear to nature's wandering child; The lyre shall ring, where sparkling Tweed, By red-stone cliff, and broom-flowered mead, And ivied walls in fair decay, Resounds along his rock-strown way. There oft the bard, at midnight still, When rove his eerie steps alone, Shall start to hear, from haunted hill, The bugle-blast at distance blown: And oft his raptured eye shall trace, Amid the visionary gloom, The foaming courser's eager pace, The mail-clad warrior's crimson plume, The beacons, blazing broad and far, The lawless marchmen ranging free, And all the pride of feudal war, And pomp of border chivalry. And Avon too has claimed the lay, Whose listening wave forgot to stray, By Shakespear's infant reed restrained: And Severn, whose suspended swell Felt the dread weight of Merlin's spell, When the lone spirits of the dell Of Arthur's fall complained. And sweetly winds romantic Dee, And Wye's fair banks all lovely smile: But all, oh Thames! submit to thee, The monarch-stream of Albion's isle. From some ethereal throne on high, Where clouds in nectar-dews dissolve, The muse shall mark, with eagle-eye, The world's diminished orb revolve. At once her ardent glance shall roll, From clime to clime, from pole to pole, O'er waters, curled by zephyr's wing, O'er shoreless seas, by whirlwinds tost; O'er vallies of perennial spring, And wastes of everlasting frost; O'er deserts, where the Siroc raves, And heaves the sand in fiery waves; O'er caverns of mysterious gloom; O'er lakes, where peaceful islets bloom, Like emerald spots, serenely-bright, Amid a sapphire field of light; O'er mountain-summits, thunder-riven, That rear eternal snows to heaven; O'er rocks, in wild confusion hurled, And woods, coeval with the world. Her eye shall thence the course explore Of every river wandering wide, From tardy Lena's frozen shore To vast La Plata's sea-like tide. Where Oby's barrier-billows freeze, And Dwina's waves in snow-chains rest: Where the rough blast from Arctic seas Congeals on Volga's ice-cold breast: “And Volga, on whose face the north-wind freezes.”Beaumont and Fletcher. Where Rhine impels his confluent springs Tumultuous down the Rhætian steep: Rhenus, Ræticarum Alpium inaccesso ac præcipiti vertice ortus. Tacitus. Where Danube's world of waters brings Its tribute to the Euxine deep: Where Seine, beneath Lutetian towers, Leads humbly his polluted stream, Recalling still the blood-red hours Of frantic freedom's transient dream: Where crowns sweet Loire his fertile soil: Where Rhone's impetuous eddies boil: Where Garonne's pastoral waves advance, Responsive to the song and dance, When the full vintage calls from toil The youths and maids of southern France: Where horned Po's once-raging flood Now moves with slackened force along, Et gemina auratus taurino cornua voltu Eridanus: quo non alius per pinguia culta In mare purpureum violentior effluit amnis. Virgilius. Impetuosissimum amnem olim Padum fuisse, ex aliis locis manifestum est; quamquam nunc ejus natura diversa esse narratur. Heyne. By hermit-isle and magic wood, The theme of old chivalric song: Where yellow Tiber's turbid tide In mystic murmurings seems to breathe Of ancient Rome's imperial pride, That passed away, as blasts divide November's vapory wreath: Where proud Tajo's golden river Rolls through fruitful realms afar: Where romantic Guadalquiver Wakes the thought of Moorish war: Where Penëus, smoothly-flowing, The propriety of this epithet may be questioned. “The vale of Tempe,” says Dr. Gillies, “is adorned by the hand of nature with every object that can gratify the senses or delight the fancy. The gently-flowing Peneus intersects the middle of the plain. Its waters are increased by perennial cascades from the green mountains, and thus rendered of sufficient depth for vessels of considerable burthen. The rocks are every where planted with vines and olives; and the banks of the river, and even the river itself, are overshadowed with lofty forest-trees, which defend those who sail upon it from the sun's meridian ardor.”—He adds in a note: “I know not why Ovid says, Penëus ab imo effusus Pindo spumosis volvitur undis. Ælian, from whom the description in the text is taken, says, that the Peneus flows ????? ??????, smooth as oil.” Livy's description, which seems to have escaped Dr. G., is singularly contradictory.—Sunt enim Tempe, saltus, etiam si non bello fiat, infestus, transitu difficilis: nam præter angustias per quinque millia, qua exiguum jumento onusto iter est, rupes utrimque ita abscissæ sunt, ut despici vix sine vertigine quadam simul oculorum animique possit. Terret et sonitus et altitudo per mediam vallem fluentis Penei amnis. The sonitus coincides with the description of Ovid, the altitudo with that of Ælian. It is difficult to reconcile the terms with each other: since altissima quæque flumina minimo sono labuntur.—We may suppose, that the Peneus is a torrent in the upper part of the vale, and gains a smoother course as it proceeds. Or Mæander's winding shore, Charm the pensive wanderer, glowing With the love of Grecian lore: Where Alphëus, wildly-falling, Dashes far the sparkling spray; In the eternal sound recalling Lost Arcadia's heaven-taught lay; Following dark, in strong commotion, Through the night of central caves, Deep beneath the unmingling ocean, ??? ?? ???????? ?????? ??????????, ??? ???????? ?????? ????. Moschus. Arethusa's flying waves: Where Tigris runs, in rapid maze: Where swift Euphrates brightly strays; To whose lone wave the night-breeze sings A song of half-forgotten days And old Assyrian kings: Where, Gangà's fertile course beside, The Hindu roves, alone to mourn, And gaze on heaven's resplendent pride, And watch for Veeshnu's tenth return; When fraud shall cease, and tyrant power Torment no more, to ruin hurled, And peace and love their blessings shower, O'er all the renovated world: Where Nile's mysterious sources sleep: Bruce penetrated to the source of the eastern branch of the Nile: that of the western, which is the principal branch, has never yet been visited by any European. Where Niger sinks, in sands unknown: The Niger has been generally supposed to terminate in a lake in the desert, where its waters are evaporated by the heat of the sun. Mr Jackson, in his account of the empire of Marocco, adduces authorities to shew, that the Nile and the Niger are actually the same river; a supposition which Major Rennel, in his geographical illustrations of Mr Park's Travels in Africa, had previously demonstrated to be altogether inadmissible. We may here, perhaps, apply the words of an Italian poet: Quel Sorridano è re dell' Esperia, Ove Balcana fiume si distende: Il Nilo crede alcun, che questo sia, Ma chi lo crede, poco sen' intende. Berni: Orlando Innamorato. Where Gambia hears, at midnight deep, Afflicted ghosts for vengeance groan: Where Mississippi's giant-stream Through savage realms impetuous pours: Where proud Potomac's cataracts gleam, Or vast Saint Lawrence darkly roars: Where Amazon her pomp unfolds Beneath the equinoctial ray, And through her drear savannahs holds Her long immeasurable way: Where'er in youthful strength they flow, Or seek old ocean's wide embrace, Her eagle-glance the muse shall throw, And all their pride and power retrace: Yet, wheresoe'er, from copious urn, Their bursting torrents flash and shine, Her eye shall not a stream discern To vie, oh sacred Thames! with thine. Along thy course no pine-clad steep, No alpine summits, proudly tower: No woods, impenetrably deep, O'er thy pure mirror darkly lower: The orange-grove, the myrtle-bower, The vine, in rich luxuriance spread; The charms Italian meadows shower; The sweets Arabian vallies shed; The roaring cataract, wild and white; The lotos-flower, of azure light; The fields, where ceaseless summer smiles; The bloom, that decks the Ægëan isles; The hills, that touch the empyreal plain, Olympian Jove's sublime domain; To other streams all these resign: Still none, oh Thames! shall vie with thine. For what avails the myrtle-bower, Where beauty rests at noon-tide hour; The orange-grove, whose blooms exhale Rich perfume on the ambient gale; And all the charms in bright array, Which happier climes than thine display? Ah! what avails, that heaven has rolled A silver stream o'er sands of gold, And decked the plain, and reared the grove, Fit dwelling for primeval love; If man defile the beauteous scene, And stain with blood the smiling green; If man's worst passions there arise, To counteract the favoring skies; If rapine there, and murder reign, And human tigers prowl for gain, And tyrants foul, and trembling slaves, Pollute their shores, and curse their waves? Far other charms than these possess, Oh Thames! thy verdant margin bless: Where peace, with freedom hand-in-hand, Walks forth along the sparkling strand, And cheerful toil, and glowing health, Proclaim a patriot nation's wealth. The blood-stained scourge no tyrants wield: No groaning slaves invert the field: But willing labor's careful train Crowns all thy banks with waving grain, With beauty decks thy sylvan shades, With livelier green invests thy glades, And grace, and bloom, and plenty, pours On thy sweet meads and willowy shores. The plain, where herds unnumbered rove, The laurelled path, the beechen grove, The lonely oak's expansive pride, The spire, through distant trees descried, The cot, with woodbine wreathed around, The field, with waving corn embrowned, The fall, that turns the frequent mill, The seat, that crowns the woodland hill, The sculptured arch, the regal dome, The fisher's willow-mantled home, The classic temple, flower-entwined, In quick succession charm the mind, Till, where thy widening current glides To mingle with the turbid tides, Thy spacious breast displays unfurled The ensigns of the assembled world. Throned in Augusta's ample port, Imperial commerce holds her court, And Britain's power sublimes: To her the breath of every breeze Conveys the wealth of subject seas, And tributary climes. Adventurous courage guides the helm From every port of every realm: Through gales that rage, and waves that whelm, Unnumbered vessels ride: Till all their various ensigns fly, Beneath Britannia's milder sky, Where roves, oh Thames! the patriot's eye O'er thy refulgent tide. The treasures of the earth are thine: For thee Golcondian diamonds shine: For thee, amid the dreary mine, The patient sufferers toil: Thy sailors roam, a dauntless host, From northern seas to India's coast, And bear the richest stores they boast To bless their native soil. O'er states and empires, near and far, While rolls the fiery surge of war, Thy country's wealth and power increase, Thy vales and cities smile in peace: And still, before thy gentle gales, The laden bark of commerce sails; And down thy flood, in youthful pride, Those mighty vessels sternly glide, Destined, amid the tempest's rattle, To hurl the thunder-bolt of battle, To guard, in danger's hottest hour, Britannia's old prescriptive power, And through winds, floods, and fire, maintain Her native empire of the main. The mystic nymph, whose ken sublime Reads the dark tales of eldest time, Scarce, through the mist of years, descries Augusta's infant glory rise. A race, from all the world estranged, Wild as the uncultured plains they ranged, Here raised of yore their dwellings rude, Beside the forest-solitude. For then, as old traditions tell, Where science now and splendor dwell, Along the stream's wild margin spread A lofty forest's mazes dread. The existence of this forest is attested by Fitzstephen. Some vestiges of it remained in the reign of Henry the Second. None dared, with step profane, impress Those labyrinths of loneliness, Where dismal trees, of giant-size, Entwined their tortuous boughs on high, Several lines in this description are imitated from Virgil, Lucan, and Tasso. —Æn. VIII. 349. Phars. III. 399. Ger. Lib. XIII. Pr. Nor hailed the cheerful morn's uprise, Nor glowed beneath the evening sky. The dire religion of the scene The rustic's trembling mind alarmed: For oft, the parting boughs between, 'Twas said, a dreadful form was seen, Of horrid eye, and threatening mien, With lightning-brand and thunder armed. Not there, in sunshine-chequered shade, The sylvan nymphs and genii strayed; But horror reigned, and darkness drear, And silence, and mysterious fear: And superstitious rites were done, Those haunted glens and dells among, That never felt the genial sun, Nor heard the wild bird's vernal song: To gods malign the incense-pyre Was kindled with unearthly fire, And human blood had oft bedewed Their ghastly altars, dark and rude. There feebly fell, at noon-tide bright, A dim, discolored, dismal light, Such as a lamp's pale glimmerings shed Amid the mansions of the dead. The Druid's self, who dared to lead The rites barbaric gods decreed, Beneath the gloom half-trembling stood; As if he almost feared to mark, In all his awful terrors dark, The mighty monarch of the wood. The Roman came: the blast of war Re-echoed wide o'er hill and dell: Beneath the storm, that blazed afar, The noblest chiefs of Albion fell. The Druids shunned its rage awhile In sylvan Mona's haunted isle, Till on their groves of ancient oak The hostile fires of ruin broke, And circles rude of shapeless stone, With lichens grey and moss o'ergrown, Alone remained to point the scene, Where erst Andraste's rites had been. When to the dust their pride was driven; When waste and bare their haunts appeared; No more the oracles of heaven, By gods beloved, by men revered, No refuge left but death or flight, They rushed, unbidden, to the tomb, Or veiled their heads in caves of night, And forests of congenial gloom. There stalked, in murky darkness wide, Revenge, despair, and outraged pride: Funereal songs, and ghastly cries, Rose to their dire divinities. Oft, in their feverish dreams, again Their groves and temples graced the plain; And stern Andraste's fiery form Called from its caves the slumbering storm, “Amongst our Britons,” says Mr Baxter, as quoted by Mr Davies, Mythology and Rites of the British Druids, p. 617, “even of the present day, Andras is a popular name of the goddess Malen, or the lady, whom the vulgar call Y Vall, that is, Fauna Fatua, and Mam y Drwg, the Devil's dam, or Y Wrach, the old hag. . . . Some regarded her as a flying spectre. . . . That name corresponded not only with Hecate, Bellona, and Enyo, but also with Bona Dea, the great mother of the gods, and the terrestrial Venus. . . . In the fables of the populace, she is styled Y Vad Ddu Hyll, that is, Bona Furva Effera, and on the other hand, Y Vad Velen, that is, Helena, or Bona Flava. . . . Agreeably to an ancient rite, the old Britons cruelly offered human sacrifices to this Andrasta: whence, as Dion relates, our amazon, Vondicca (Boadicea) invoked her with imprecations, previous to her engagement with the Romans. The memory of this goddess, or fury, remains to the present day; for men in a passion growl at each other, Mae rhyw Andras arnochwi: Some Andrasta possesses you.” And whelmed, with thunder-rolling hand, The flying Roman's impious band. It chanced, amid that forest's shade, That frowned where now Augusta towers, A Roman youth bewildered strayed, While swiftly fell the evening hours. Around his glance inquiring ran: No trace was there of living man: Forms indistinct before him flew: The darkening horror darker grew: Till night, in death-like stillness felt, Around those dreary mazes dwelt. Sudden, a blaze of lurid blue, That flashed the matted foliage through, Illumed, as with Tartarean day, The knotted trunks and branches grey. Sensations, wild and undefined, Rushed on the Roman warrior's mind: But deeper wonder filled his soul, When on the dead still air around, Like symphony from magic ground, Mysterious music stole: Such strains as flow, when spirits keep, Around the tombs where wizards sleep, Beneath the cypress foliage deep, The rites of dark solemnity; And hands unearthly wildly sweep The chords of elfin melody. The strains were sad: their changeful swell, And plaintive cadence, seemed to tell Of blighted joys, of hopes o'erthrown, Of mental peace for ever flown, Of dearest friends, by death laid low, And tears, and unavailing woe. Yet something of a sterner thrill With those sad strains consorted ill, As if revenge had dared intrude On hopeless sorrow's darkest mood. Guided by those sulphureous rays, The Roman pierced the forest maze; Till, through the opening woodland reign, Appeared an oak-encircled plain, Where giant boughs expanded high Their storm-repelling canopy, And, central in the sacred round, Andraste's moss-grown altar frowned. The mystic flame of lurid blue There shed a dubious, mournful light, And half-revealed to human view The secret majesty of night. An ancient man, in dark attire, Stood by the solitary fire: The varying flame his form displayed, Half-tinged with light, half-veiled in shade. His grey hair, gemmed with midnight dew, Streamed down his robes of sable hue: His cheeks were sunk: his beard was white: But his large eyes were fiery-bright, And seemed through flitting shades to range, With wild expression, stern and strange. There, where no wind was heard to sigh, Nor wandering streamlet murmured by, While every voice of nature slept, The harp's symphonious strings he swept: Such thrilling tones might scarcely be The touch of mortal minstrelsy; Now rolling loud, and deep, and dread, As if the sound would wake the dead, Now soft, as if, with tender close, To bid the parted soul repose. The Roman youth with wonder gazed On those dark eyes to heaven upraised, Where struggling passions wildly shone, With fearful lustre, not their own. Awhile irresolute he stood: At length he left the sheltering wood, And moved towards the central flame: But, ere his lips the speech could frame, —“And who art thou?”—the Druid cried, While flashed his burning eye-balls wide,— “Whose steps unhallowed boldly press This sacred grove's profound recess? Ha! by my injured country's doom! I know the hated arms of Rome. Through this dark forest's pathless way Andraste's self thy steps has led, To perish on her altars grey, A grateful offering to the dead. Oh goddess stern! one victim more To thee his vital blood shall pour, And shades of heroes, hovering nigh, Shall joy to see a Roman die! With that dread plant, that none may name, I feed the insatiate fire of fate: Roman! with this tremendous flame Thy head to hell I consecrate!”— Te, Appi, tuumque caput sanguine hoc consecro. Livius. Agli infernali dei Con questo sangue il capo tuo consacro. Alfieri. And, snatching swift a blazing brand, He dashed it in the Roman's face, And seized him with a giant's hand, And dragged him to the altar's base. Though worn by time and adverse fate, Yet strength unnaturally great He gathered then from deadly hate And superstitious zeal: A dire religion's stern behest Alone his phrensied soul possessed; Already o'er his victim's breast Hung the descending steel. The scene, the form, the act, combined, A moment on the Roman's mind An enervating influence poured: But to himself again restored, Upspringing light, he grasped his foe, And checked the meditated blow, And on the Druid's breast repelled The steel his own wild fury held. The vital stream flowed fast away, And stained Andraste's altars grey. More ghastly pale his features dire Gleamed in that blue funereal fire: The death-mists from his brow distilled: But still his eyes strange lustre filled, That seemed to pierce the secret springs Of unimaginable things. No longer, with malignant glare, Revenge unsated glistened there, And deadly rage, and stern despair: All trace of evil passions fled, He seemed to commune with the dead, And draw from them, without alloy, The raptures of prophetic joy. A sudden breeze his temples fanned: His harp, untouched by human hand, Sent forth a sound, a thrilling sound, That rang through all the mystic round: The incense-flame rose broad and bright, In one wide stream of meteor-light. He knew what power illumed the blaze, What spirit swept the strings along: Full on the youth his kindling gaze He fixed, and poured his soul in song. Roman! life's declining tide From my bosom ebbs apace: Vengeance have the gods denied For the ruin of my race. Triumph not: in night compressed, Yet the northern tempests rest, Doomed to burst, in fatal hour, On the pride of Roman power. Sweetly beams the morning ray: Proudly falls the noon-tide glow: See! beneath the closing day, Storm-clouds darken, whirlwinds blow! Sun-beams gild the tranquil shore: Hark! the midnight breakers roar! O'er the deep, by tempests torn, Shrieks of shipwrecked souls are borne! Queen of earth, imperial Rome Rules, in boundless sway confessed, From the day-star's orient dome To the limits of the west. Proudest work of mortal hands, The Eternal City stands: Bound in her all-circling sphere, Monarchs kneel, and nations fear. Hark! the stream of ages raves: Gifted eyes its course behold: Down its all-absorbing waves Mightiest chiefs and kings are rolled. Every work of human pride, Sapped by that eternal tide, Shall the raging current sweep Tow'rds oblivion's boundless deep. Confident in wide control, Rome beholds that torrent flow, Heedless how the waters roll, Wasting, mining, as they go. That sure torrent saps at length Walls of adamantine strength: Down its eddies wild shall pass Domes of marble, towers of brass. As the sailor's fragile bark, Beaten by the adverse breeze, Sinks afar, and leaves no mark Of its passage o'er the seas; So shall Rome's colossal sway In the lapse of time decay, Leaving of her ancient fame But the memory of a name. Vainly raged the storms of Gaul Round dread Jove's Tarpeian dome: See in flames the fabric fall! 'Tis the funeral pyre of Rome! Sed nihil æque, quam incendium Capitolii, ut finem imperio adesse crederent, impulerat. Captam olim à Gallis urbem; sed, integra Jovis sede, mansisse imperium. Fatali nunc igne, signum cœlestis irœ datum, et possessionem rerum humanarum transalpinis gentibus portendi, superstitione vana Druidæ canebant. Tacitus. Red-armed vengeance rushes forth In the whirlwinds of the north: From her hand the sceptre riven To transalpine realms is given. Darkness veils the stream of time, As the wrecks of Rome dissolve: Years of anarchy and crime In barbaric night revolve. From the rage of feudal strife Peace and freedom spring to life, Where the morning sun-beams smile On the sea-god's favorite isle. Hail! all hail! my native land! Long thy course of glory keep: Long thy sovereign sails expand O'er the subjugated deep! When of Rome's unbounded reign Dust and shade alone remain, Thou thy head divine shalt raise, Through interminable days. Death-mists hover: voices rise: I obey the summons dread: On the stone my life-blood dyes Sinks to rest my weary head. Far from scenes of night and woe, To eternal groves I go, Where for me my brethren wait By Andraste's palace-gate.

Oh Genius of that sacred urn, Adored by all the Naiad train! Once more my wandering steps return To trace the precincts of thy reign: Once more, amid my native plain, I roam thy devious course along, And in the oaken shade again Awake to thee the votive song. Dear stream! while far from thee I strayed, The woods, that crown my natal glade, Have mourned on all the winds of heaven Their yellow faded foliage driven; And winter, with tempestuous roar, Descending on thy wasted shore, Has seen thy turbid current flow A deluge of dissolving snow. But now, in spring's more soft control, Thy troubled waves subside, And through a narrower channel roll A brighter, gentler tide. Emerging now in light serene, The meadows spread their robes of green, The weeping willow droops to lave Its leafy tresses in the wave; The poplar and the towering pine Their hospitable shade combine; Qua pinus ingens albaque populus Umbram hospitalem consociare amant Ramis, et obliquo laborat Lympha fugax trepidare rivo. Horatius. And, flying like the flying day, The silent river rolls away. Not here, in dreadful grandeur piled, The mountain's pathless masses rise, Where wandering fancy's lonely child Might meet the spirit of the skies: Not here, from misty summits hoar, Where shattered firs are rooted strong, With headlong force and thundering roar The bursting torrent foams along: Sublime the charms such scenes contain: For nature on her mountain reign Delights the treasures to dispense Of all her wild magnificence: But thou art sweet, my native stream! Thy waves in liquid lustre play, And glitter in the morning beam, And chime to rest the closing day: While the vast mountain's dizzy steep The whirlwind's eddying rage assails, The gentlest zephyrs softly sweep The verdure of thy sheltered vales: While o'er the wild and whitening seas The unbridled north triumphant roars, Thy stream scarce ripples in the breeze, That bends the willow on thy shores: And thus, while war o'er Europe flings Destruction from his crimson wings, While Danube's wasted banks around The steps of mingling foes resound, Thy pure waves wash a stainless soil, To crown a patriot people's toil. Yet on these shores, in elder days, Arose the battle's maddening blaze: Even here, where now so softly swells The music of the village-bells, The painted savage rolled to war The terrors of the scythed car, And wide around, with fire and sword, The devastating Roman poured: Here shouted o'er the battle-plain The Pict, the Saxon, and the Dane: And many a long succeeding year Saw the fierce Norman's proud career, The deadly hate of feudal foes, The stain that dyed the pallid rose, And all the sanguinary spoil Of foreign and intestine broil. But now, through banks from strife remote, Thy crystal waters wind along, Responsive to the wild bird's note, Or lonely boatman's careless song. Oh! ne'er may thy sweet echoes swell Again with war's demoniac yell! Oh! ne'er again may civil strife Here aim the steel at kindred life! Ne'er may those deeds of night and crime, That stain the rolls of feudal time, Again pollute these meads and groves, Where science dwells, and beauty roves! And should some foreign tyrant's band Descend to waste the beauteous land, Thy swelling current, eddying red, Shall roll away the impious dead. Let fancy lead, from Trewsbury Mead, The Thames rises in a field called Trewsbury Mead, near the villages of Tarlton and Kemble, in Gloucestershire. With hazel fringed, and copsewood deep, Where scarcely seen, through brilliant green, Thy infant waters softly creep, To where the wide-expanding Nore Beholds thee, with tumultuous roar, Conclude thy devious race, And rush, with Medway's confluent wave, To seek, where mightier billows rave, Thy giant-sire's embrace. Where Kemble's wood-embosomed spire Adorns the solitary glade, And ancient trees, in green attire, Diffuse a deep and pleasant shade, I am slightly indebted, in this stanza, to one of Ariosto's most exquisite descriptions: La fonte discorrea per mezzo un prato, D'arbori antiqui e di bell' ombre adorno, Che i viandanti col mormorio grato A bere invita, e a far seco soggiorno. Un culto monticel dal manco lato Le difende il calor del mezzo giorno. Quivi, come i begli occhi prima torse, D'un cavalier la giovane s'accorse: D'un cavalier, che all' ombra d'un boschetto, Nel margin verde, a bianco, e rosso, e giallo, Sedea pensoso, tacito, e soletto, Sopra quel chiaro e liquido cristallo. Thy bounteous urn, light-murmuring, flings The treasures of its infant springs, And fast, beneath its native hill, Impels the silver-sparkling rill, With flag-flowers fringed and whispering reeds, Along the many-colored meads. Thames! when, beside thy secret source Remembrance points the mighty course Thy defluent waters keep; Advancing, with perpetual flow, Through banks still widening as they go, To mingle with the deep; Emblemed in thee, my thoughts survey Unruffled childhood's peaceful hours, And blooming youth's delightful way Through sunny fields and roseate bowers; And thus the scenes of life expand Till death draws forth, with steady hand, Our names from his capacious urn; And dooms alike the base and good, To pass that all-absorbing flood, O'er which is no return. Whence is the ample stream of time? “Whence is the stream of years? whither do they roll along? where have they hid, in mist, their many-colored sides?” Ossian. Can fancy's mightiest spell display, Where first began its flow sublime, Or where its onward waves shall stray? What gifted hand shall pierce the clouds Oblivion's fatal magic rears, And lift the sable veil, that shrouds The current of the distant years? The sage with doubt the past surveys, Through mists which memory half dispels: And on the course of future days Impenetrable darkness dwells. The present rolls in light: awhile We hail its evanescent smile, Rejoicing as it flies: Ephemera on the summer-stream, Heedless of the descending beam, And distant lowering skies. False joys, with fading flowerets crowned, And hope, too late delusive found, And fancy's meteor-ray, And all the passions, light and vain, That fill ambition's fatal train, Attend our downward way. Some struggle on, by tempests driven: To some a gentler course is given: All down the self-same stream are rolled: Their day is passed—their tale is told. Youth flies, as bloom forsakes the grove, When icy winter blows: And transient are the smiles of love, As dew-drops on the rose. Nor may we call those things our own, ? tamquam Sit proprium quidquam, puncto quod mobilis horæ, Nunc prece, nunc pretio, nunc vi, nunc sorte suprema, Permutet dominos, et cedat in altera jura. Horatius. Which, ere the new-born day be flown, By chance, or fraud, or lawless might, Or sterner death's supreme award, Will change their momentary lord, And own another's right. As oceans now o'er quicksands roar, Where fields and hamlets smiled of yore; As now the purple heather blows, Where once impervious forests rose; So perish from the burthened ground The monuments of human toil: Where cities shone, where castles frowned, The careless ploughman turns the soil. How many a chief, whose kindling mind Convulsed this earthly scene, Has sunk, forgotten by mankind, As though he ne'er had been! Even so the chiefs of modern days, On whom admiring nations gaze, Shall sink, by common fate oppressed: Their name, their place, remembered not: Not one grey stone to point the spot Of their eternal rest. Flow proudly, Thames! the emblem bright And witness of succeeding years! Flow on, in freedom's sacred light, Nor stained with blood, nor swelled with tears. Sweet is thy course, and clear, and still, By Ewan's old neglected mill: Green shores thy narrow stream confine, Where blooms the modest eglantine, And hawthorn-boughs o'ershadowing spread, To canopy thy infant bed. Now peaceful hamlets wandering through, And fields in beauty ever new, Where Lechlade sees thy current strong First waft the unlaboring bark along; Thy copious waters hold their way Tow'rds Radcote's arches, old and grey, Where triumphed erst the rebel host, When hapless Richard's hopes were lost, And Oxford sought, with humbled pride, Existence from thy guardian tide. Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford and Duke of Ireland, the favorite of Richard the Second, was defeated in the vicinity of Radcote by the Earl of Derby, in the year 1387, and escaped by swimming with his horse across the river. The wild-flower waves, in lonely bloom, On Godstow's desolated wall: There thin shades flit through twilight gloom, And murmured accents feebly fall. The aged hazel nurtures there Its hollow fruit, so seeming fair, And lightly throws its humble shade, Where Rosamonda's form is laid. A small chapel, and a wall, enclosing an ample space, are all now remaining of Godstow Nunnery. A hazel grows near the chapel, the fruit of which is always apparently perfect, but is invariably found to be hollow. This nunnery derives its chief interest from having been the burial-place of the beautiful Rosamond, who appears, after her death, to have been regarded as a saint. The rose of earth, the sweetest flower That ever graced a monarch's breast, In vernal beauty's loveliest hour, Beneath that sod was laid to rest. In vain, the bower of love around, The Dædalëan path was wound: Alas! that jealous hate should find The clue for love alone designed! The venomed bowl,—the mandate dire,— The menaced steel's uplifted glare,— The tear, that quenched the blue eye's fire,— The humble, ineffectual prayer:— All these shall live, recorded long In tragic and romantic song, And long a moral charm impart, To melt and purify the heart. A nation's gem, a monarch's pride, In youth, in loveliness, she died: The morning sun's ascending ray Saw none so fair, so blest, so gay: Ere evening came, her funeral knell Was tolled by Godstow's convent bell. The marble tomb, the illumined shrine, Their unavailing splendor gave: Where slept in earth the maid divine, The votive silk was seen to wave. To her, as to a martyred saint, His vows the weeping pilgrim poured: The drooping traveller, sad and faint, Knelt there, and found his strength restored: To that fair shrine, in solemn hour, Fond youths and blushing maidens came, And gathered from its mystic power A brighter, purer, holier flame: The lightest heart with awe could feel The charm her hovering spirit shed: But superstition's impious zeal Distilled its venom on the dead! A fanatical priest, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, visiting the nunnery at Godstow, and observing a tomb, covered with silk, and splendidly illuminated, which he found, on inquiry, to be the tomb of Rosamond, commanded her to be taken up, and buried without the church, lest the Christian religion should grow into contempt. This brutal order was instantly obeyed:—“but the chaste sisters,” says Speed, “gathered her bones, and put them in a perfumed bag, enclosing them so in lead, and laid them again in the church, under a fair large grave-stone, about whose edges a fillet of brass was inlaid, and thereon written her name and praise: these bones were at the suppression of the nunnery so found.”— The illumined shrine has passed away: The sculptured stone in dust is laid: But when the midnight breezes play Amid the barren hazel's shade, The lone enthusiast, lingering near, The youth, whom slighted passion grieves, Through fancy's magic spell may hear A spirit in the whispering leaves; And dimly see, while mortals sleep, Sad forms of cloistered maidens move, The transient dreams of life to weep, The fading flowers of youth and love! Now, rising o'er the level plain, Mid academic groves enshrined, The Gothic tower, the Grecian fane, Ascend, in solemn state combined. Science, beneath those classic spires, Illumes her watch-lamp's orient fires, And pours its everlasting rays On archives of primeval days. To her capacious view unfurled, The mental and material world Their secrets deep display: She measures nature's ample plan, To hold the light of truth to man, And guide his erring way. Oh sun-crowned science! child of heaven! To wandering man by angels given! Still, nymph divine! on mortal sight Diffuse thy intellectual light, Till all the nations own thy sway, And drink with joy the streams of day! Yet lovest thou, maid! alone to rove In cloister dim, or polished grove, Where academic domes are seen Emerging grey through foliage green? Oh! hast thou not thy hermit seat, Embosomed deep in mountains vast, Where some fair valley's still retreat Repels the north's impetuous blast? The falling stream there murmurs by: The tufted pine waves broad and high: And musing silence sits beneath, Where scarce a zephyr bends the heath, And hears the breezes, loud and strong, Resound the topmost boughs among. There peace her vestal lamp displays, Undimmed by mad ambition's blaze, And shuns, in the sequestered glen, The storms that shake the haunts of men, Where mean intrigue, and sordid gain, And phrensied war's ensanguined reign, And narrow cares, and wrathful strife, Dry up the sweetest springs of life. Oh! might my steps, that darkly roam, Attain at last thy mountain home, And rest, from earthly trammels free, With peace, and liberty, and thee! Around while faction's tempests sweep, Like whirlwinds o'er the wintry deep, And, down the headlong vortex torn, The vain, misjudging crowd is borne; 'Twere sweet to mark, re-echoing far, The rage of the eternal war, That dimly heard, at distance swelling, Endears, but not disturbs, thy dwelling. But sweeter yet, oh trebly sweet! Were those blest paths of calm retreat, Might mutual love's endearing smile The lonely hours of life beguile! Love, whose celestial breath exhales Fresh fragrance on the vernal gales; Whose starry torch and kindling eye Add lustre to the summer sky; Whose voice of music cheers the day, When autumn's wasting breezes sway; Whose magic flame the bosom warms, When freezing winter wakes in storms! Not in the glittering halls of pride, Where spleen and sullen pomp reside, Around though Paphian odors breathe, And fashion twines her fading wreath, Young fancy wakes her native grace, Nor love elects his dwelling-place. But in the lone, romantic dell, Where the rural virtues dwell, Where the sylvan genii roam, Mutual love may find a home. Hope, with raptured eye, is there, Weaving wreaths of pictured air: Smiling fancy there is found, Tripping light on fairy ground, Listening oft, in pine-walks dim, To the wood-nymph's evening hymn. But whither roams the devious song, While Thames, unheeded, flows along, And, sinking o'er the level mead, The classic domes and spires recede? The dashing oar the wave divides: The light bark down the current glides: The furrowed stream, that round it curls, In many a murmuring eddy whirls. Succeeding each as each retires, Wood-mantled hills, and tufted spires, Groves, villas, islets, cultured plains, Towers, cities, palaces, and fanes, As holds the stream its swift career, Arise, and pass, and disappear. O'er Nuneham Courtnay's flowery glades Soft breezes wave their fragrant wings, And still, amid the haunted shades, The tragic harp of Mason rings. Yon votive urn, yon drooping flowers, Disclose the minstrel's favorite bowers, Where first he tuned, in sylvan peace, To British themes the lyre of Greece. Delight shall check the expanded sail In woody Marlow's winding vale: And fond regret for scenes so fair With backward gaze shall linger there, Till rise romantic Hedsor's hills, And Cliefden's groves, and springs, and rills, Where hapless Villars, doomed to prove The ills that wait on lawless love, In festal mirth, and choral song, Impelled the summer-hours along, Nor marked, where scowled expectant by Despair, and shame, and poverty. The Norman king's embattled towers Look proudly o'er the subject plain, Where, deep in Windsor's regal bowers, The sylvan muses hold their reign. From groves of oak, whose branches hoar Have heard primeval tempests roar, Beneath the moon's pale ray they pass Along the shore's unbending grass, And songs of gratulation raise, To speak a patriot monarch's praise. Sweetly, on yon poetic hill, Strains of unearthly music breathe, Where Denham's spirit, hovering still, Weaves his wild harp's aërial wreath. And sweetly, on the mead below, The fragrant gales of summer blow: While flowers shall spring, while Thames shall flow, That mead shall live in memory, Where valor, on the tented field, Triumphant raised his patriot shield, The voice of truth to kings revealed, And broke the chains of tyranny. The stream expands: the meadows fly: The stately swan sails proudly by: Full, clear, and bright, with devious flow, The rapid waters murmuring go. Now open Twitnam's classic shores, Where yet the moral muse deplores Her Pope's unrivalled lay: Unmoved by wealth, unawed by state, He held to scorn the little great, And taught life's better way. Though tasteless folly's impious hand Has wrecked the scenes his genius planned;— Though low his fairy grot is laid, And lost his willow's pensive shade;— Yet shall the ever-murmuring stream, That lapt his soul in fancy's dream, Its vales with verdure cease to crown, Ere fade one ray of his renown. Fair groves, and villas glittering bright, Arise on Richmond's beauteous height; Where yet fond echo warbles o'er The heaven-taught songs she learned of yore. From mortals veiled, mid waving reeds, The airy lyre of Thomson sighs, And whispers to the hills and meads: In yonder grave a Druid lies! The seasons there, in fixed return, Around their minstrel's holy urn Perennial chaplets twine: Oh! never shall their changes greet, Immortal bard! a song more sweet, A soul more pure than thine! Oh Thames! in conscious glory glide By those fair piles that crown thy tide, Where, worn with toil, from tumult far, The veteran hero rests from war. Here, marked by many a well-fought field, On high the soldier hangs his shield; The seaman there has furled his sail, Long rent by many an adverse gale. Remembered perils, braved and past,— The raging fight, the whelming blast, The hidden rock, the stormy shore, The mountain-breaker's deepening roar,— Recalled by fancy's spell divine, Endear their evening's calm decline, And teach their children, listening near, To emulate their sires' career. But swiftly urge the gliding bark, By yon stern walls and chambers dark, Where guilt and woe, in night concealed, Unthought, unwitnessed, unrevealed, Through lengthened ages scowling stood, Mid shrieks of death, and tears of blood. No heart may think, no tongue declare, The fearful mysteries hidden there: Justice averts her trembling eye, And mercy weeps, and hastens by. Fama di loro il mondo esser non lassa: Misericordia e giustizia gli sdegna: Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passa. Dante. Long has the tempest's rage been spent On yon unshaken battlement, Memorial proud of days sublime, Whose splendor mocks the power of time. There, when the distant war-storm roared, While patriot thousands round her poured, The British heroine grasped her sword, To trace the paths of victory: But in the rage of naval fight, The island-genius reared his might, And stamped, in characters of light, His own immortal destiny. Ascending dark, on uplands brown, The ivied walls of Hadleigh frown: High on the lonely mouldering tower Forms of departed ages lower. But deeper, broader, louder, glide The waves of the descending tide; And soon, where winds unfettered roar, Where Medway seeks the opening Nore, Where breakers lash the dark-red steep, The red cliffs of the isle of Sheppy. The barks of Britain stem the deep. Oh king of streams! when, wandering slow, I trace thy current's ceaseless flow, And mark, with venerating gaze, Reflected on thy liquid breast, The monuments of ancient days, Where sages, bards, and statesmen rest; Who, waking erst the ethereal mind, Instructed, charmed, and blessed mankind The rays of fancy pierce the gloom That shrouds the precincts of the tomb, And call again to life and light The forms long wrapped in central night. From abbies grey and castles old, Through mouldering portals backward rolled, Glide dimly forth, with silent tread, The shades of the illustrious dead. Still dear to them their native shore, The woods and fields they loved of yore; And still, by farthest realms revered, Subsists the rock-built tower they reared, Though lightnings round its summit glow, And foaming surges burst below. Thames! I have roamed, at evening hours, Near beauteous Richmond's courtly bowers, When, mild and pale, the moon-beams fell On hill and islet, grove and dell; And many a skiff, with fleecy sail Expanded to the western gale, Traced on thy breast, serenely-bright, The lengthening line of silver light; And many an oar, with measured dash Accordant to the boatman's song, Bade thy pellucid surface flash, And whirl, in glittering rings, along; While from the broad and dripping blade The clear drops fell, in sparkling showers, Bright as the crystal gems, displayed In Amphitrite's coral bowers. There beauty wooed the breeze of night, Beneath the silken canopy, And touched, with flying fingers light, The thrilling chords of melody. It seemed, that music's inmost soul Was breathed upon the wandering airs, Charming to rest, with sweet control, All human passions, pains, and cares. Enthusiast voices joined the sound, And poured such soothing strains around, That well might ardent fancy deem, The sylphs had led their viewless band, To warble o'er the lovely stream The sweetest songs of fairyland. Now, breathing wild, with raptured swell, They floated o'er the silent tide; Now, soft and low, the accents fell, And, seeming mystic tales to tell, In heavenly murmurs died. Yet that sweet scene of pensive joy Gave mournful recollections birth, And called to fancy's wild employ The certain destinies of earth. I seemed to hear, in wakening thought, While those wild minstrel accents rung, Whate'er historic truth had taught, Or philosophic bards had sung. Methought a voice, severe and strange, Whispered of fate, and time, and change, And bade my wandering mind recall, How nations rise, and fade, and fall. Thus fair, of old, Euphrates rolled, By Babylon's imperial site: The lute's soft swell, with magic spell, Breathed rapture on the listening night: Love-whispering youths and maidens fair In festal pomp assembled there, Where to the stream's responsive moan The desert-gale now sighs alone. Still changeless, through the fertile plain, Araxes, loud-resounding, flows, Where gorgeous despots fixed their reign, And Chil-minar's proud domes arose. “The plain of Persepolis is watered by the great river Araxes, or Bendemir. The ancient palace of the kings of Persia, called by the inhabitants Chil-minar, i.e. forty columns, is situated at the foot of the mountain: the walls of this stately building are still standing on three sides; and it has the mountain on the east.” Universal History. High on his gem-emblazoned throne Sate kneeling Persia's earthly god: Fair slaves and satraps round him shone, And nations trembled at his nod: The mighty voice of Asia's fate Went forth from every golden gate. Now pensive steps the wrecks explore, That skirt the solitary shore: The time-worn column mouldering falls, And tempests rock the roofless walls. Perchance, when many a distant year, Urged by the hand of fate, has flown, Where moonbeams rest on ruins drear, The musing sage may rove alone; And many an awful thought sublime May fill his soul, when memory shews, That there, in days of elder time, The world's metropolis arose; Where now, by mouldering walls, he sees The silent Thames unheeded flow, And only hears the river-breeze, Through reeds and willows whispering low. Where are the states of ancient fame? Athens, and Sparta's victor-name, And all that propped, in war and peace, The arms, and nobler arts, of Greece? All-grasping Rome, that proudly hurled Her mandates o'er the prostrate world, Long heard mankind her chains deplore, And fell, as Carthage fell before. Sanazzaro, in his poem De partu Virginis, has a fine passage on the fallen state of Carthage, which Tasso has imitated in the Gerusalemme Liberata: Et qui vertentes inmania saxa juvencos Flectit arans, qua devictæ Carthaginis arces Procubuere, jacentque infausto in litore turres Eversæ. Quantum illa metus, quantum illa laborum Urbs dedit insultans Latio et Laurentibus arvis! Nunc passim vix reliquias, vix nomina servans, Obruitur propriis non agnoscenda ruinis. Et querimur genus infelix humana labare Membra ævo, quum regna palam moriantur, et urbes. Giace l'alta Cartago: appena i segni Dell'alte sue ruine il lido serba. Muojono le città; muojono i regni; Copre i fasti e le pompe arena ed erba: E l'uom d'esser mortal par che si sdegni. O nostra mente cupida e superba! Is this the crown, the final meed, To man's sublimest toils decreed? Must all, from glory's radiant height, Descend alike the paths of night? Must she, whose voice of power resounds On utmost ocean's loneliest bounds, In darkness meet the whelming doom That crushed the sovereign strength of Rome, And o'er the proudest states of old The storms of desolation rolled? Time, the foe of man's dominion, Wheels around in ceaseless flight, Scattering from his hoary pinion Shades of everlasting night. Still, beneath his frown appalling, Man and all his works decay: Still, before him, swiftly-falling, Kings and kingdoms pass away. Cannot the hand of patriot zeal, The heart that seeks the public weal, The comprehensive mind, Retard awhile the storms of fate, That, swift or slow, or soon or late, Shall hurl to ruin every state, And leave no trace behind? Oh Britain! oh my native land! To science, art, and freedom dear! Whose sails o'er farthest seas expand, And brave the tempest's dread career! When comes that hour, as come it must, That sinks thy glory in the dust, May no degenerate Briton live, Beneath a stranger's chain to toil, And to a haughty conqueror give The produce of thy sacred soil! Oh! dwells there one, on all thy plains, If British blood distend his veins, Who would not burn thy fame to save, Or perish in his country's grave? Ah! sure, if skill and courage true Can check destruction's headlong way, Still shall thy power its course pursue, Nor sink, but with the world's decay. Long as the cliff that girds thine isle The bursting surf of ocean stems, Shall commerce, wealth, and plenty smile Along the silver-eddying Thames: ??????? ??? ???????, ???????????. Homerus. Still shall thine empire's fabric stand, Admired and feared from land to land, Through every circling age renewed, Unchanged, unshaken, unsubdued; As rocks resist the wildest breeze, That sweeps thy tributary seas. PALMYRA ? ?????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ???????. ????. ANALYSIS An address to the spirit of ancient times introduces an evening contemplation on the ruined magnificence of Palmyra, on the obscurity that involves its history, its monuments, its inscriptions in a language now unknown. Fancy calls up the forms of its monarchs, chiefs, and philosophers; few of whose names, in addition to those of Odenathus, Zenobia, and Longinus, have survived the lapse of years. Time asserts his empire over the ruins, and dissipates the phantoms of fancy. The silence and solitude of the evening twilight, in these scenes of desolated splendor, present an impressive contrast to the days of their past prosperity. Human passions, and the actions that result from them, are nearly the same in all ages and nations. All the works of man are subject to the same decay. Even these ruins will disappear from the desert. Time and change have absolute dominion over every thing terrestrial but virtue and the mind. Spirit of the days of yore! Thou! who, in thy haunted cave, By the torrent's sounding shore, Mark'st the autumnal tempest rave: Or, where on some ivied wall Twilight-mingled moonbeams fall, Deep in aisles and cloisters dim, Hear'st the grey monks' vesper hymn: Or, beneath the cypress shade, Where forgotten chiefs are laid, Pacing slow with solemn tread, Breathest the verse that wakes the dead!— By the ivied convent lone, By the Runic warrior's stone, By the mountain-cataract's roar, Spirit! thee I seek no more. Let me, remote from earthly care, Thy philosophic vigils share, Amid the wrecks of ancient time, More sad, more solemn, more sublime, Where, half-sunk in seas of sand, Thedmor's marble wastes expand. These silent wrecks, more eloquent than speech, Full many a tale of awful note impart: Truths more severe than bard or sage can teach This pomp of ruin presses on the heart. Sad through the palm the evening breezes sigh: No sound of man the solitude pervades, Where shattered forms of ancient monarchs lie, Mid grass-grown halls, and falling colonnades. Beneath the drifting sand, the clustering weed, Rest the proud relics of departed power. None may the trophy-cinctured tablet read, On votive urn, or monumental tower, Nor tell whose wasted forms the mouldering tombs embower. Enthusiast fancy, robed in light, Dispels oblivion's deepening night. Her charms a solemn train unfold, Sublime on evening's clouds of gold, Of sceptred kings, in proud array, And laurelled chiefs, and sages grey. But whose the forms, oh fame! declare, That crowd majestic on the air? Pour from thy deathless roll the praise Of kings renowned in elder days. I call in vain! The welcome strain Of praise to them no more shall sound: Their actions bright must sleep in night, Till time shall cease his mystic round. The glories of their ancient sway The stream of years has swept away: Their names, that nations heard with fear, Shall ring no more on mortal ear. Yet still the muse's eye may trace The noblest chief of Thedmor's race, Who, by Euphrates' startling waves, Bade outraged Rome her prostrate might unfold, Tore from the brow of Persia's pride The wreath in crimson victory dyed, And o'er his flying slaves Tumultuous ruin rolled. Throned by his side, a lovely form, In youthful majesty sublime, Like sun-beams through the scattering storm, Shines through the floating mists of time: Even as in other years she shone, When here she fixed her desert-throne, Triumphant in the transient smiles of fate; When Zabdas led her conquering bands O'er Asia's many-peopled lands, And subject monarchs thronged her palace-gate: Ere yet stern war's avenging storm, Captivity's dejected form, And death, in solitude and darkness furled, Closed round the setting star, that ruled the eastern world. Dim shades around her move again, From memory blotted by the lapse of years: Yet, foremost in the sacred train, The venerable sage appears, Who once, these desolate arcades And time-worn porticoes among, Disclosed to princely youths and high-born maids The secret fountains of Mæonian song, And traced the mazy warblings of the lyre, With all a critic's art, and all a poet's fire. What mystic form, uncouth and dread, With withered cheek, and hoary head, Swift as the death-fire cleaves the sky, Swept on sounding pinions by? 'Twas Time. I know the foe of kings, His scythe, and sand, and eagle-wings: He cast a burning look around, And waved his bony hand, and frowned. Far from the spectre's scowl of fire, Fancy's feeble forms retire: Her air-born phantoms melt away, Like stars before the rising day. One shadowy tint enwraps the plain: No form is near, no steps intrude, To break the melancholy reign Of silence and of solitude. Ah! little thought the wealthy proud, When rosy pleasure laughed aloud, And music, with symphonious swell, Attuned to joy her festal shell, That here, amid their ancient land, The wanderer of the distant days Should mark, with sorrow-clouded gaze, The mighty wilderness of sand, While not a sound should meet his ear, Save of the desert-gales, that sweep, In modulated murmurs deep, The wasted graves above Of those, who once had revelled here In happiness and love. Short is the space to man assigned, This earthly vale to tread. He wanders, erring, weak, and blind, By adverse passions led: Love, that with feeling's tenderest flow To rapture turns divided woe, And brightens every smile of fate That kindred souls participate: Jealousy, whose poisonous breath Blasts affection's opening bud: Wild despair, that laughs in death: Stern revenge, that bathes in blood: Fear, that his form in darkness shrouds, And trembles at the whispering air: And hope, that pictures on the clouds Celestial visions, false, but fair. From the earliest twilight-ray, That marked creation's natal day, Till yesterday's declining fire, Thus still have rolled, perplexed by strife, The many-mingling wheels of life, And still shall roll, till time's last beams expire. And thus, in every age, in every clime, While years swift-circling fly, The varying deeds, that mark the present time, Will be but shadows of the days gone by. Swift as the meteor's midnight course, Swift as the cataract's headlong force, Swift as the clouds, whose changeful forms Hang on the rear of flying storms, So swift is Time's colossal stride Above the wrecks of human pride. These temples, awful in decay, Whose ancient splendor half endures, These arches, dim in parting day, These dust-defiled entablatures, These shafts, whose prostrate pride around The desert-weed entwines its wreath, These capitals, that strew the ground, Their shattered colonnades beneath, These pillars, white in lengthening files, Grey tombs, and broken peristyles, May yet, through many an age, retain The pomp of Thedmor's wasted reign: But Time still shakes, with giant-tread, The marble city of the dead, That crushed at last, a shapeless heap, Beneath the drifted sands shall sleep. The flower, that drinks the morning-dew, Far on the evening gale shall fly: The bark, that glides o'er ocean blue, Dashed on the distant rocks shall lie: The tower, that frowns in martial pride, Shall by the lightning-brand be riven: The arch, that spans the summer tide, Shall down the wintry floods be driven: The tomb, that guards the great one's name, Shall yield to time its sacred trust: The laurel of imperial fame Shall wither in unwatered dust. His mantle dark oblivion flings Around the monuments of kings, Who once to conquest shouting myriads bore. Fame's trumpet-blast, and victory's clarion shrill, Pass, like an echo of the hill, That breathes one wild response, and then is heard no more. But ne'er shall earthly time throw down The immortal pile that virtue rears: Her golden throne, and starry crown, Decay not with revolving years: For He, whose solemn voice controlled Necessity's mysterious sway, And yon vast orbs from chaos rolled Along the elliptic paths of day, Has fixed her empire, vast and high, Where primogenial harmony Unites, in ever-cloudless skies, Affection's death-divided ties; Where wisdom, with unwearying gaze, The universal scheme surveys, And truth, in central light enshrined, Leads to its source sublime the indissoluble mind. INSCRIPTION FOR A MOUNTAIN-DELL Whoe'er thou art, by love of nature led These cloud-capped rocks and pathless heights to climb! Approach this dell with reverential dread, Where, bosomed deep in solitudes sublime, Repose the secrets of primeval time. But if thy mind degenerate cares degrade, Or sordid hopes convulse, or conscious crime, Fly to the sunless glen's more genial shade, Nor with unhallowed steps this haunted ground invade. Here sleeps a bard of long-forgotten years: Nameless he sleeps, to all the world unknown: His humble praise no proud memorial bears: Remote from man, he lived and died alone. Placed by no earthly hand, one mossy stone Yet marks the sod where his cold ashes lie. Across that sod one lonely oak has thrown Its tempest-shattered branches, old and dry; And one perennial stream runs lightly-murmuring by. He loved this dell, a solitary child, And placed that oak, an acorn, in the sod: And here, full oft, in hermit-visions wild, In scenes by every other step untrod, With nature he conversed, and nature's god. He fled from superstition's murderous fane, And shunned the slaves of Circe's baleful rod, The mean, malignant, mercenary train, That feed at Moloch's shrine the unholy fires of gain. The stream, that murmured by his favorite stone, The breeze, that rustled through his youthful tree, To fancy sung, in sweetly-mingled tone, Of future joys, which fate forbade to be. False as the calm of summer's treacherous sea Is beauty's smile, in magic radiance drest. Far from that fatal shore, fond wanderer, flee! Rocks lurk beneath the ocean's limpid breast, And, deep in caves of night, storms darkly-brooding rest. Love poured the storm that wrecked his youthful prime: Beneath his favorite tree his bones were laid: Through rolling ages towered its strength sublime, Ordained, unseen, to flourish and to fade. Its mossy boughs, now sapless and decayed, Fall in the blast, and moulder in the shower: Yet be the stately wreck with awe surveyed, Sad monument of time's unsparing power, That shakes the marble dome, and adamantine tower. Such was the oak, from whose prophetic shell Breathed the primeval oracles of Greece: And here, perhaps, his gentle shade may dwell, Diffusing tenderness and heavenly peace, Of power to bid the rage of passion cease, When some fond youth, capricious beauty's slave, Seeking from care in solitude release, Shall sit upon the minstrel's lonely grave, And hear through withered boughs the mountain-breezes rave. THE PHILOSOPHY OF MELANCHOLY A POEM, IN FOUR PARTS ?????? ???????????? ??????. GENERAL ANALYSIS I. The contemplation of the universal mutability of things prepares the mind to encounter the vicissitudes of life. The spirit of philosophical melancholy, which delights in that contemplation, is the most copious source of virtue, of courage, and of genius. The pleasures arising from it are the most pure and permanent that man is capable of enjoying. It is felt in every scene and sound of nature; more especially, in the solemn grandeur of mountain-scenery, and in the ruined magnificence of former times. II. The finest efforts of art, in painting, music, poetry, and romance, derive their principal charms from melancholy. III. The social affections derive from this sentiment their most endearing ties. It reigns in the interchanged consolations of love; in the sympathetic charity, which seeks out, and relieves, affliction; in the retrospective attachment, which dwells on the scenes of our childhood, and on the memory of departed friends. IV. The mind, familiarised to the contemplation of vicissitudes, rises superior to calamity; perceives, that the existence of a certain portion of evil is indispensable to the general system of nature, and to the enlargement of the human faculties; and ascends, from the observation of apparently discordant particulars, to the knowledge of that all-perfect wisdom, which arranges the whole in harmony. PART I Egli è da forte Il sopportar le avversità: ma fora Vil stupidezza il non sentirne il carco. Alfieri. ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART The influence of change on all the works of nature and art. Inability of the gay and frivolous to endure vicissitude. Beneficial influence of melancholy, in familiarising the mind to the contemplation of change, and preparing it for the reverses of fortune: Not the gloomy melancholy of the monastic cloister, but that sublime and philanthropical sentiment, the source of energetic virtue, which filled the mind of Zoroaster, when he retired to the mountains of Balkhan: of Cicero, when he discovered the tomb of Archimedes, or wandered in the groves of the academy: of Germanicus Cæsar, when he directed the interment of the three legions in the wood of Teutoburgium. Philosophical melancholy propitious to youthful genius: illustrated in Petrarch and Tasso. This solemn disposition of thought, which strengthens the mind while it softens the heart, can only be attained by occasional self-communion, and retirement from the world. All natural scenes are favorable to its indulgence: for the aspect of nature is always serious, and her sweetest sounds are melancholy. Mountain-scenery peculiary calculated to nourish this propensity. Scenery of Merionethshire. A cataract in flood:—in frost. Harlech Castle. General effect of ruins. Caius Marius in the ruins of Carthage. The vernal streams in liquid radiance flow: The green woods smile in summer's sultry glow: Vine-mantled autumn's many-sounding breeze Waves the ripe corn, and shakes the leafless trees: Then sullen winter holds his lonely reign, Pours the wide deluge o'er the wasted plain, Hurls fast and far the snow-flakes wildly tost, Wraps heaven in clouds, and binds the earth in frost. Through every season man's long toils proceed: The sumptuous palace decks the polished mead: New rivers roll, new forests grace the land, Where once the heather struck its roots in sand: High on the cliff the watch-tower frowns afar, Lights the red blaze, and spreads the storm of war: Vast moles extend where billows boiled before, And roll the vanquished ocean from the shore. All-conquering time, still faithful to his trust, Shakes the proud dome, and sinks the tower in dust: Art's failing streams disown their sandy urns, The forest withers, and the heath returns. Vindictive ocean re-asserts his sway, Wears the strong mound, and bursts his whelming way. Spring gently breaks, by vale, and stream, and steep, The icy chains of nature's transient sleep, Dispels the volumed clouds, that coldly lower, Warms the young grove, and gilds the opening flower: But when shall spring's Promethean torch relume Man's sovereign strength, or beauty's roseate bloom? Thrill the fond heart, or wake the expansive mind, That night's cold vaults, and death's long slumbers bind? Why loves the muse the melancholy lay? Why joys the bard, in autumn's closing day, To watch the yellow leaves, that round him sail, And hear a spirit moan in every gale? To seek, beneath the moon, at midnight hour, The ivied abbey, and the mouldering tower, And, while the wakening echoes hail his tread, In fancy hold communion with the dead? Ah! rather yet, while youth's warm sunshine glows, Crown the full bowl, and crop the breathing rose, In dance and song the rapid hours employ, Nor lose one smile of life's too transient joy! This is the favorite argument of the Epicurean poets. Anacreon, Horace, and Menzini, have given it a thousand exquisite turns: but it has never been expressed with more grace and vivacity, than by Redi, in the opening of his incomparable dithyrambic. Se dell' uve il sangue amabile Non rinfranca ognor le vene, Questa vita è troppo labile, Troppo breve, e sempre in pene, Sì bel sangue è un raggio acceso Di quel sol che in ciel vedete, E rimase avvinto e preso Di più grappoli alla rete. Su su dunque in questo sangue Rinnoviam l' arterie e i musculi; E per chi s'invecchia e langue Prepariam vetri majusculi: Ed in festa baldanzosa, Tra gli scherzi, e tra le risa, Lasciam pur, lasciam passare Lui che in numeri e in misure Si ravvolge e si consuma, E quaggiù Tempo si chiama: E bevendo, e ribevendo, I pensier mandiamo in bando. I may, perhaps, gratify the English reader, by subjoining a translation of this passage. If the grape's celestial blood Restore not every hour the veins, This life rolls on, a turbid flood, A fleeting tide of tears and pains. This purple blood was once a ray Of yon refulgent orb of day, Drawn by the grape's bright-clustering snare, And captured, and concentered there. Then with this liquid solar beam Replenish we our vital stream, And for the oldest, feeblest soul Prepare the most capacious bowl: And while in sport and festal song We roll the autumnal hours along, Heed we not that foe of pleasures, Foe of all things fair and blooming, Who, in numbers and in measures, Self-revolving, self-consuming, Sounding one eternal chime, Is called by careful mortals Time: Nor let one thought our bliss deform Of evening-cloud and wintry storm. Can the fond hours, in morning revels past, Teach the light heart to meet the evening blast? When sudden clouds the changeful day deform, The gay ephemeron dies beneath the storm: The sheltered bee, long provident of change, Furls his soft wings, nor dreads the whirlwind's range. Oh melancholy! blue-eyed maid divine! Thy fading woods, thy twilight walks, be mine! No sudden change thy pensive votaries feel: They mark the whirl of fortune's restless wheel, Taught by the past the coming hour to scan, No wealth, no glory, permanent to man. Not thine, blest power! the misanthropic gloom, That gave its living victims to the tomb, Forced weeping youth to bid the world farewell, And hold sad vigils in the cloistered cell. Thy lessons train the comprehensive mind, The sentient heart, that glows for all mankind, The intrepid hand, the unsubdued resolve, Whence wisdom, glory, liberty, devolve. Thy mountain-fane the Bactrian prophet sought, Selon les livres des Parses, Zoroastre a consulté Ormuzd sur les montagnes, et l'on assuroit du tems de Dion Chrysostome, que par un principe d'amour pour la sagesse et pour la justice, ce législateur s'étoit éloigné du commerce des hommes, et avoit vécu seul dans une montagne. Vie de Zoroastre, par M. Anquetil du Perron. Felt all thy wild solemnity of thought, Gazed o'er the spacious earth, the radiant heaven, And found new life, and strength, and feeling given. Great nature's book unclosed beneath his hand, And peace and science blessed a barbarous land. The Latian seer thy sacred influence knew, When to Trinacrian vales his steps withdrew, And traced, amid the grass that clustering crept, The secret stone where Archimedes slept: See the Tusculan Disputations. Or when, by thirst of science led to rove, He paced alone through Plato's silent grove, Recalled the gifted tongue, the impressive page, And waked to life the grey Athenian sage. The difference between the effect of a perception and an idea, in awakening associated thoughts and feelings, is finely described in the introduction to the fifth book De finibus. We agreed, says Cicero, that we should take our afternoon's walk in the academy, as at that time of the day it was a place where there was no resort of company. Accordingly, at the hour appointed, we went to Piso's.—We passed the time in conversing on different matters during our short walk from the double gate, till we came to the academy, that justly celebrated spot; which, as we wished, we found a perfect solitude. “I know not,” said Piso, “whether it be a natural feeling, or an illusion of the imagination founded on habit, that we are more powerfully affected by the sight of those places which have been much frequented by illustrious men, than when we either listen to the recital, or read the detail, of their actions. At this moment, I feel strongly that emotion which I speak of. I see before me the perfect form of Plato, which was wont to dispute in this place: these gardens not only recall him to my memory, but present his very form to my senses. I fancy to myself, that here stood Speusippus, there Xenocrates; and here, on this bench, sat his disciple Polemo. To me, our ancient senate-house seems peopled with the like visionary forms: for often when I enter it, the shades of Scipio, of Cato, and of Lælius, and, in particular, of my venerable grandfather, rise to my imagination. In short, such is the effect of local situation in recalling associated ideas to the mind, that it is not without reason, some philosophers have founded on this principle a species of artificial memory.” Stewart's Philosophy of the Mind. Yet the modern Athenians “walk with supine indifference among the glorious ruins of antiquity: and it would not be easy, in the country of Plato and Demosthenes, to find a reader, or a copy, of their works.” See the sixty-second chapter of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In scenes like these that mighty mind he nursed, Whose pious force o'er ruthless Verres burst, Disclosed the cells of treason's midnight dome, And saved from fate the menaced walls of Rome. Thy powerful spell Germanicus obeyed, In Teutoburgium's horror-breathing shade, Haud procul Teutoburgiensi saltu, in quo reliquiæ Vari legionumque insepultæ dicebantur. Igitur cupido Cæsarem invadit solvendi suprema militibus, ducique; permoto ad miserationem omni, qui aderat, exercitu, ob propinquos, amicos, denique ob casus bellorum, et sortem hominum. Præmisso Cæcina, ut occulta saltuum scrutaretur, pontesque et aggeres humido paludum et fallacibus campis imponeret, incedunt mœstos locos, visuque ac memoria deformes. Prima Vari castra, lato ambitu, et dimensis principiis, trium legionum manus ostentabant: dein semiruto vallo, humili fossa, accisæ jam reliquiæ consedisse intelligebantur: medio campi albentia ossa, ut fugerant, ut restiterant, disjecta vel aggerata: adjacebant fragmina telorum, equorumque artus, simul truncis arborum antefixa ora: lucis propinquis barbaræ aræ, apud quas tribunos, ac primorum ordinum centuriones mactaverant: et cladis ejus superstites, pugnam aut vincula elapsi, referebant: “Hic cecidisse legatos; illic raptas aquilas; primum ubi vulnus Varo adactum; ubi infelici dextra, et suo ictu mortem invenerit; quo tribunali concionatus Arminius; quot patibula captivis, quæ scrobes; utque signis et aquilis per superbiam inluserit.” Igitur Romanus qui aderat exercitus, sextum post cladis annum, trium legionum ossa, nullo noscente alienas reliquias an suorum humo tegeret, omnes ut conjunctos, ut consanguineos, aucta in hostem ira, mœsti simul et infensi condebant. Primum exstruendo tumulo cespitem Cæsar posuit, gratissimo munere in defunctos, et præsentibus doloris socius. Tacitus. The Romans were now at a small distance from the forest of Teutoburgium, where the bones of Varus and his legions were said to be still unburied. Touched by this affecting circumstance, Germanicus resolved to pay the last human office to the relics of that unfortunate commander and his slaughtered soldiers. The same tender sentiment diffused itself through the army: some felt the touch of nature for their relations, others for their friends; and all lamented the disasters of war, and the wretched lot of human kind. Cæcina was sent forward to explore the woods; where the waters were out, to throw over bridges, and by heaping loads of earth on the swampy soil, to secure a solid footing. The army marched through a gloomy solitude. The place presented an awful spectacle, and the memory of a tragic event increased the horror of the scene. The first camp of Varus appeared in view. The extent of the ground, and the three different inclosures for the eagles still distinctly seen, left no doubt but the whole was the work of the three legions. Farther on were traced the ruins of a rampart, and the hollow of a ditch well nigh filled up. This was supposed to be the spot, where the few who escaped the general massacre made their last effort, and perished in the attempt. The plains around were white with bones, in some places thinly scattered, in others lying in heaps, as the men happened to fall in flight, or in a body resisted to the last. Fragments of javelins, and the limbs of horses, lay scattered about the field. Human sculls were seen upon the trunks of trees. In the adjacent woods stood the savage altars, where the tribunes and principal centurions were offered up a sacrifice with barbarous rites. Some of the soldiers who survived that dreadful day, and afterwards broke their chains, related circumstantially several particulars. “Here the commanders of the legions were put to the sword: on that spot the eagles were seized. There Varus received his first wound: and this the place where he gave himself the mortal stab, and died by his own sword. Yonder mound was the tribunal from which Arminius harangued his countrymen; here he fixed his gibbets; there he dug the funeral trenches; and in that quarter he offered every mark of scorn and insolence to the colors and the Roman eagles.” Six years had elapsed since the overthrow of Varus; and now, on the same spot, the Roman army collected the bones of their slaughtered countrymen. Whether they were burying the remains of strangers, or of their own friends, no man knew; all however considered themselves as performing the last obsequies to their kindred and brother soldiers. While employed in this pious office, their hearts were torn with contending passions, by turns oppressed with grief, and burning for revenge. A monument to the memory of the dead was raised with turf: Germanicus with his own hand laid the first sod; discharging at once the tribute due to the legions, and sympathising with the rest of the army. Murphy. Where deep in woods, that knew no genial day, The slaughtered Varus and his legions lay. The soldier saw, in wild disorder cast, The bones of thousands bleaching in the blast, Here closely piled, there scattered wide and far, Even as they urged, or shunned, the waves of war. The mouldering horse, his rider's bones beside, Lay on the broken eagle's prostrate pride: Shields, swords, and helms, in shattered heaps were spread, The long rank fern waved lonely o'er the dead. In pious silence sad, the warrior train Paid the last honors to the unnumbered slain. Unknowing each, to whose remains he gave Their narrow portion of the general grave, Foemen and friends in common earth they pressed, While rage and pity glowed in every breast. Hence the dread storm of Roman vengeance broke, That bowed the treacherous German to the yoke: O'er prostrate foes triumphant valor trod, And gave sweet sleep to every hero's sod. Led by thy charms to nature's rural bower, The youthful fancy feels thy plastic power. Valchiusa's bard, by Sorga's mystic source, Sought thy soft haunts, and owned thy tender force. There, in his laurel's favorite shade reclined, With love and thee he shared his captive mind. There as he mourned, when death's cold dews enfurled That transient flower, too lovely for the world, Questa aspettata al regno degli Dei Cosa bella mortal passa e non dura. Petrarca: S. ccx. in Vita di M. L. Life to her form thy fond enchantment gave: In pensive semblance by the wandering wave, A sylvan nymph, light-gliding through the grove, She breathed pure accents of celestial love. See the sonnets of Petrarch in Morte di M. Laura, particularly the thirteenth: Quante fiate al mio dolce ricetto Fuggendo altrui, e se esser può me stesso, Vo con gli occhi bagnando l' erba e il petto, Rompendo co i sospir l' aere dappresso: Quante fiate sol pien di sospetto Per luoghi ombrosi e foschi mi son messo, Cercando col pensier l' alto diletto, Che morte ha tolto, onde io la chiamo spesso: Or in forma di ninfa o d' altra diva, Che del più chiaro fondo di Sorga esca, E pongasi a sedere in su la riva; Or l' ho veduta su per l' erba fresca Calcare i fior come una donna viva, Mostrando in vista che di me le incresca. Thy witchery first, to Tasso's gifted eyes, Bade knights, and maids, and wily sorcerers rise. While thee he wooed, in pastoral shades retired, And poured the lay thy pensive haunts inspired, At once, his forest-cinctured seat around, Mysterious music breathed a solemn sound: The whispering air, the stream's melodious play, The lute, the virgin's voice, the wild-bird's lay, In one commingling strain around him flowed: Passa più oltre, ed ode un suono intanto, Che dolcissimamente si diffonde. Vi sente d'un ruscello il roco pianto, E il sospirar dell' aura infra le fronde; E di musico cigno il flebil canto, E l' usignuol, che plora, e gli risponde; Organi, e cetre, e voci umane in rime: Tanti e sì fatti suoni un suono esprime. Tasso: G.L. xviii. 18. With flashing arms the echoing woodlands glowed: Heroes and damsels scoured along the glade, Love sighed, spears flew, spells frowned, in every shade: Clorinda poured her softened soul in pain, And false Armida knelt and wept in vain. Far from the scenes the wretched vulgar prize, Thy cedar-groves, and cypress-bowers, arise. Thrice happy he, who flies from public care, At twilight-hour to court thy influence there! In every mead, and grove, and upland dell, Some silent walk, some solitary cell, Where'er untutored nature blossoms free, The lone enthusiast consecrates to thee. Where nature is, thou art: her every scene, Her every sound that wakes the woodlands green, The lamb's soft cry, the night-bird's note divine, The watch-dog's bark, the wild-bee's horn, are thine. Thy potent spells with solemn mystery fill The raging torrent and the murmuring rill, With elfin whispers load the trembling trees, And give a voice of music to the breeze. Thine are the caves on Arvon's rocky shore, Where ocean chafes with everlasting roar: Thine the tumultuous rivers, wildly-whirled, From Meirion's forest-mantled mountains hurled. Oh beauteous Meirion! Cambria's mountain-pride! Still memory sees thy eddying waters glide, As when, embowered in sweet Festiniog's vale, I shunned the storms that man's close haunts assail, Lulled by the ceaseless dash of confluent streams In fairy-fancies and Arcadian dreams. O'er the blue deep thy mossy castles frown: Thy mighty cataracts burst and thunder down: The rock-set ash, with tortuous branches grey, Veils the deep glen, and drinks the flying spray; And druid oaks extend their solemn shades O'er the fair forms of Britain's loveliest maids. The Welch have a very pleasing ballad, Morwynnion glân Meirionnydd, which assigns, with strict poetical justice, the palm of female loveliness to the young ladies of that most picturesque and beautiful county. Thee, melancholy! oft I hailed alone, On Moëlwyn's heights, and Idris' stormy throne, While mists and clouds, contracted or unfurled, Now closed from view, now half-revealed the world. By the wild glens, where struggling Cynfael raves, Or swift Velenrhyd breaks his echoing waves, Sublime the task, in autumn's humid day, To watch the impetuous torrents force their way, High-swoln by rains, and chafing with the breeze, Hurling the loosened stones, the uprooted trees, ?? ??????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ???????, ?????????? ???? ???????, ?????????? ???? ?????, ?????? ?? ???? ???????, ?????? ?? ?? ?????? ?????????, ?????? ?? ?? ????????? ??? ??? ??????. ??????. With meteor-swiftness rushing from the steep, To roll the mountain-havoc to the deep. More wildly sweet, nor less sublime, the scene, When winter smiled in cloudless skies serene, When winds were still, and ice enchained the soil, O'er its white bed to see the cataract toil. The sheeted foam, the falling stream beneath, Clothed the high rocks with frost-work's wildest wreath: Round their steep sides the arrested ooze had made A vast, fantastic, crystal colonnade: The scattering vapor, frozen ere it fell, With mimic diamonds spangled all the dell, Decked the grey woods with many a pendent gem, And gave the oak its wintry diadem. Thee have I met, on Harlech's castled verge, In journeying from Llanvair to the Traeth Mawr, our crusaders must have passed either through or very near the town of Harlech, and as it remains unnoticed by Giraldus, I should imagine that no fortress of any consequence existed there at the period of Baldwin's progress through Wales. Mr. Pennant says, “That an ancient fortress at this place bore the name of Twr Bronwen, from Bronwen, or the White Necked, sister to Bran ap Llyr, King of Britain. In after times it got the name of Caer Collwyn, from Collwyn ap Tango, who lived there in the time of Prince Anarawd, about the year 877, and was lord of Efionydd, Ardudwy, and part of Llyn. He resided some time in a square tower of the ancient fortress, whose remains are very apparent, as are part of the old walls, which the more modern, in certain places, are seen to rest upon.” Its present name of Harddlech, or Harlech, is derived from hardd, towering or bold, and llech, a rock, and is truly applicable to its situation. The present stately castle, seated on a high and bold projecting rock, is supposed to owe its foundation to the same royal hand that erected the magnificent fortresses of Conwy, Caernarvon, and Beaumaris. In the year 1283, Hugh de Wlonkeslow received the annual salary of one hundred pounds, as constable of the castle. When England was embroiled in the civil wars, David ap Ievan, ap Eineon, a British nobleman, who sided with the House of Lancaster, defended this castle stoutly against Edward the Fourth, until William Herbert,Earl of Pembroke, forcing his way, with incredible difficulty, through the British Alps, attacked it with so much vigor, that it was surrendered into his hands. The rugged track by which his army marched to the siege, is said to have retained the name of Lhe Herbert, or Herbert's way. Hoare's Giraldus Cambrensis. Soothed by the music of the plaintive surge, When evening's vocal wind, in mournful sport, Waved the dark verdure of the mouldering court, While falling fragments shook the echoing tower, And flitting forms forsook their twilight bower, To bid the shades of Cambrian grandeur frown, Of Edward's might, and Herbert's old renown. Thine is the mossy convent's crumbling pile, The weed-choked tomb, the ivy-mantled aisle: Thine every scene, that tells of splendor past: Thine every tower, that totters to the blast. Thee Marius knew, beside the lonely bay, Where in black heaps extinguished Carthage lay. Marius, upon his expulsion from Rome, retired to his own villa at Salonium; and, being unprovided for a longer flight, sent his son to the farm of one Mutius, a friend in the neighbourhood, to procure what might be necessary for a voyage by sea. The young man was discovered at this place, and narrowly escaped, in a waggon loaded with straw, which, the better to deceive his pursuers, was ordered to take the road to Rome. The father fled to Ostia, and there embarked on board a vessel which was provided for him by Numerius, who had been one of his partizans in the late troubles. Having put to sea, he was forced by stress of weather to Circeii, there landed in want of every necessary, and made himself known to some herdsmen, of whom he implored relief. Being informed of the parties that were abroad in pursuit of him, he concealed himself in a neighbouring wood. Next day, as he was within a few miles of the town of Minturnæ, he was alarmed at the sight of some horsemen, ran with all the speed he could make to the shore, and, with much difficulty, got on board of a boat which was passing. The persons, with whom he thus took refuge, resisted the threats and importunities of the pursuers, to have him delivered up to them, or thrown into the sea; but having rowed him to a supposed place of safety, at the mouth of the Liris, they put him on shore, and left him to his fate. Here he first took refuge in a cottage, afterwards under a hollow bank of the river, and, last of all, on hearing the tread of horsemen, who still pursued him, he plunged himself to the chin in the marsh; but, though concealed by the reeds and the depth of the water, he was discovered, and dragged from thence all covered with mud. He was carried to Minturnæ, and doomed by the magistrates of the place to suffer the execution of the sentence, which had been denounced against himself and his partizans at Rome. He was, however, by some connivance, allowed to escape from hence, again put to sea, and, at the island Ænaria, joined some associates of his flight. Being afterwards obliged to land in Sicily for a supply of water, and being known, he narrowly escaped with the loss of some of the crew that navigated his vessel. From thence he arrived on the coast of Africa; but being forbid the province by the Prætor Sextilius, continued to shift his abode among the islands or places of retirement on the coast. Marius was in his seventieth year, when he made this attempt to overturn the Roman republic by means of popular tumults, and when he strove to obtain the command of an army in the busiest and most arduous service which the Roman empire had then to offer. Being forced, by his miscarriage in this attempt, into the state of an outlaw, he still amused the world with adventures and escapes, which historians record with the embellishments of a picturesque, and even romantic, description. A Gaulish or German soldier, who was employed at Minturnæ to put him to death, overawed by his aspect, recoiled from the task; and the people of the place, as if moved by the miracle, concurred in aiding his escape. The presence of such an exile on the ground where Carthage had stood, was supposed to increase the majesty and the melancholy of the scene. “Go,” he said to the Lictor, who brought him the orders of the Prætor to depart, “tell him that you have seen Marius sitting on the ruins of Carthage.” Ferguson's Roman Republic. Unknowing whither next to bend his tread, Or where conceal his death-devoted head, On those dark wrecks his tearless eye he turned: That eye, where yet the imperial spirit burned; That eye, whose fire the trembling Gaul controlled, And struck the uplifted dagger from his hold. Oh! had some genius, to instruct mankind, Seized the swift thoughts that passed the exile's mind! When mid those devastated walls he sate, Revolved his own, and that fair city's fate, Traced, with prophetic gaze, the emblemed doom Of earth's proud mistress, and his tyrant, Rome, And watched the sea-breeze wave its rustling wings Round the green tombs of unremembered kings. PART II O lacrymarum fons, tenero sacros Ducentium ortus ex animo: quater Felix, in imo qui scatentem Pectore te, pia nympha, sensit. Gray. ANALYSIS OF THE SECOND PART In art, as in nature, those pleasures, in which melancholy mingles, are more powerful, and more permanent, than those which have their origin in lighter sensations. Painting, music, poetry, and romance, illustrate this proposition: Painting: in the soft landscapes of Claude Lorraine, and the gloomy grandeur of Salvator Rosa. Music:—the first natural music of all nations is exclusively melancholy. Hence that irresistible command over the passions, which it is said to have possessed in the infancy of society. Fabulous power of music, illustrated in the instance of Orpheus. Music on a mountain-lake in the evening-twilight: its effect on the mind of the traveller. Poetry: in the favorite subjects of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Tasso, and Ariosto: particularly tragedy: as in the Electra of Sophocles, the Medea of Euripides, the Lear and Romeo and Juliet of Shakespear, the Zayre of Voltaire, and the Virginia of Alfieri. Extraordinary effect of the poetry of Euripides on the minds of the Syracusans. Romance derives from melancholy its principal charm, which consists in dwelling on the sorrows of counteracted love. Episode of Rinaldo and Rosaura. Nor yet alone in nature's scenes sublime, The wrecks of matter, and the wastes of time, Thy spirit dwells diffused. Thy genial sway The sister arts, a pensive train, obey. Thine are the fairest forms the pencil wreathes: The sweetest spell impassioned music breathes: The tragic muse, in gorgeous trappings pale, The feudal legend, and the love-lorn tale. In Claude's soft touch thy tenderest magic reigns: His evening-vallies, and his weed-twined fanes. Salvator's hand thy darkest grandeur caught, Traced the vast plan, and seized the daring thought, Fixed in his den the living bandit's form, Piled the black rock, and grasped the Alpine storm. In music's earliest shell thy soul was felt, When in rude caves primeval shepherds dwelt. The plaintive pipe, attuned to pastoral love, Soothed the stern genius of the uncultured grove. Then mystic bards, from Vesta's sacred fire, Caught thy pure spell, and strung the vocal lyre; Lulled with its infant charm the winds to sleep, Tamed the wild herds, and stilled the stormy deep. Armed with thy thrilling lyre's celestial might, The Thracian bard subdued the powers of night. Charmed as he sung, suspended Styx was calm: The tortured ghosts inhaled unwonted balm: The pale shades flitted from their caves of dread: At, cantu conmotæ, Erebi de sedibus imis Umbræ ibant tenues, simulacraque luce carentum. Quin ipsæ stupuere domus atque intima Leti Tartara, cæruleosque inplexæ crinibus anguis Eumenides; tenuitque inhians tria Cerberus ora. Virgilius. The serpents slumbered on Alecto's head: In grim respose the dog of darkness lay, And captured hell restored its beauteous prey. Vain gift, by love's imprudent ardor crost! Too dearly valued, and too lightly lost! Thine are the lute's soft-warbled strains that wake The twilight-echoes of the mountain-lake, When silent nature drinks the plaintive lay, When not a ripple strikes the pebbly bay, When the reflected rock lies dark and still, And the light larch scarce trembles on the hill. The wanderer's feet, o'er foreign steeps that roam, Pause at the strains that soothed his distant home: Fond fancy hears, in every changeful swell, The tender accents of the last farewell; ? intenerisce il core Lo di che han detto ai dolci amici, addio. Dante: Purgatorio, viii. Pr. Recalls, in every note, some wild-wood shade, Some cherished friend, some long-remembered maid. Can the fantastic jest, the antic mirth, The laugh, that charms the grosser sons of earth, A joy so true, so softly sweet, bestow, As genius gathers from the springs of woe? How dwells the mind on Hector's funeral fire, Marks the red blaze of Dido's distant pyre, Hears from his grave the dead Patroclus call, Or sees the last of Ilion's sovereigns fall! Deep pity dwells, with fear-suspended breath, On Pisa's tower, and Ugolino's death; With vain remorse sees wretched Tancred burn, And twines the cypress round Zerbino's urn. Thalia's smile, the sportive mime's employ, Yield the light heart a transitory joy: But when revenge Electra's shrieks invoke; When fell Medea deals the murderous stroke; When houseless Lear holds commune with the storm; When Juliet falls on Romeo's faded form; When Zara's bosom bleeds 'twixt love and zeal, While frantic Osman bares the glittering steel; When the stern sire, with maddening rage imprest, Draws the red dagger from Virginia's breast, And imprecates, in accents wildly dread, Infernal vengeance on the tyrant's head; Who feels not then the pure ethereal sway Of that sweet spell thy songs alone convey? O'er Nicias slain when flapped the raven's wing, See, in Dr. Gillies's Ancient Greece, the narrative of the disastrous expedition of the Athenians against Sicily. And Athens mourned the year's extinguished spring; “When the youth of a country, said Pericles, have perished in battle, and are lost to the state, it is, as if the spring were taken from the year.” Drummond's Academical Questions. When the sad remnant of her warrior-train Delved the dark mine, and dragged the captive chain; They poured, to soothe their pestilential toil, The tragic lays that charmed their native soil. The savage conqueror paused, in pensive mood; Caught the sweet strain, and felt his soul subdued. Nicias had little to expect from the humanity of a proud and victorious Spartan; but Demosthenes might naturally flatter himself with the hope of justice. He urged with energy, but urged in vain, the observance of the capitulation, which had been ratified with due forms, on the faith of which he had surrendered himself and the troops entrusted to his command. The public prisoners, conducted successively to Syracuse, and exceeding together the number of seven thousand, were treated with the same inhuman cruelty. They were universally condemned to labor in the mines and quarries of Sicily: their whole sustenance was bread and water: they suffered alternately the ardors of a scorching sun, and the chilling damps of autumn. For seventy days and nights they languished in this dreadful captivity, during which the diseases incident to their manner of life were rendered infectious by the stench of the dead bodies, which corrupted the purity of the surrounding air. At length, an eternal separation was made between those who should enjoy the happier lot of being sold as slaves into distant lands, and those who should for ever be confined to their terrible dungeons. The Athenians, with such Italians and Sicilians as had unnaturally embraced their cause, were reserved for the latter doom. Their generals Nicias and Demosthenes had not lived to behold this melancholy hour. Gylippus would have spared their lives, not from any motives of humanity or esteem, but that his joyous return to Sparta might have been graced by their presence. But the resentment of the Syracusans, the fears of the Corinthians, above all, the suspicious jealousy of those perfidious traitors who had maintained a secret correspondence with Nicias, which they dreaded lest the accidents of his future life might discover, loudly demanded the immediate execution of the captive generals. The Athenians of those times justly regretted the loss of Demosthenes, a gallant and enterprising commander; but posterity will for ever lament the fate of Nicias, the most pious, the most virtuous, and the most unfortunate man of the age in which he lived. Amidst this dark and dreadful scene of cruelty and revenge, we must not omit to mention one singular example of humanity, which broke forth like a meteor in the gloom of a nocturnal tempest. The Syracusans, who could punish their helpless captives with such unrelenting severity, had often melted into tears at the affecting strains of Euripides, an Athenian poet, who had learned in the Socratic school to adorn the lessons of philosophy with the charms of fancy, and who was regarded by the taste of his contemporaries, as he still is by many competent and impartial judges, as the most tender and pathetic, the most philosophical and instructive, of all tragic writers. The pleasure, which the Syracusans had derived from his inimitable poetry, made them long to hear it rehearsed by the flexible voices and harmonious pronunciation of the Athenians, so unlike, and so superior, to the rudeness and asperity of their own Doric dialect. They desired their captives to repeat the plaintive scenes of their favorite bard. The captives obeyed, and affecting to represent the woes of ancient kings and heroes, they too faithfully expressed their own. Their taste and sensibility endeared them to the Syracusans, who released their bonds, received them with kindness into their families, and after treating them with all the honorable distinctions of ancient hospitality, restored them to their longing and afflicted country, as a small but precious wreck of the most formidable armament that had ever sailed from a Grecian harbour. At their return to Athens, they walked in solemn procession to the house of Euripides, whom they gratefully hailed as their deliverer from slavery and death: an acknowledgment, infinitely more honorable than all the crowns and splendor that ever surrounded the person, and even than all the altars and temples that ever adorned the memory, of a poet. Gillies's Ancient Greece. Man's common doom, the mighty griefs of kings, Responsive struck on feeling's slumbering strings, Rolled back the dungeon's iron doors, and gave Life to the man, and freedom to the slave. Oh! when the grateful band, on festal day, Hailed the blest bard who struck their chains away, To grace his brow in deathless light they bore A prouder crown than eastern despots wore. Thy voice romance in woodland-darkness hears, Where mystery broods upon the spoils of years; Where midnight sprites round scenes of terror rave, Udolpho's towers, or Julian's dreadful cave. See the romance of The Three Brothers. To thee she sings, her Runic cairn around, Where the blue death-flame glows along the ground: Odin was supposed to guard the monuments of the dead from sacrilege, by certain sacred and wandering fires which played around them. Northern Antiquities. From thee she draws her myrtle's tenderest bloom, That pity wreathes round love's untimely tomb. Where black rocks scowl, and many a tufted pine Waves o'er the bleak and cloud-capped Apennine; Where bursts the cataract from primeval snows; The stately towers of Count Anselmo rose. One only child was his: a peerless maid, By many a youth with hopeless pain surveyed: For young Rinaldo claimed her secret sigh, Nor shunned the flame her father's watchful eye. Their youthful passion's silken bonds he tore With ruthless hand, and barred his iron door. His weight of woe Rinaldo strove to bear, And wandered wide, in heart-corroding care. His minstrel lyre, across his shoulder flung, With sweet accordance soothed the woes he sung. Their course of grief twelve lingering months had held, When the sad youth, by bleeding hopes impelled, Retraced his lonely steps, in pensive mood, O'er outraged love's still-cherished haunts to brood. He found the chapel decked, the altar drest, To force Rosaura to a rival's breast. His anguished mind, in wounded passion's flow, Formed wild resolves, and pictured deeds of woe. Bright shone the moon on old Anselmo's towers: The bird of night complained in laurel bowers: The inconstant clouds, by rising breezes driven, Scoured, black and swift, along the midnight heaven. There, as beside the moat's dull wave he strayed, His fond gaze rested on his long-loved maid, Where sad she paced, on him alone intent, Along the windy, moonlight battlement. He saw her hair in lengthened tresses stream; Her tearful eye, dim-glistening in the beam: Awhile he gazed: his inmost soul was moved: He touched the lay, that most he knew she loved. Oh! while those thrilling strains around her stole, Can language paint the tumult of the soul, That fixed in light the retrospective scene, And wakened every bliss that once had been? Her ardent glance, quick-turned towards the note, Where the pale moon-beams quivered on the moat, Hailed the loved form, her constant thought's employ, And glowed at once with recognising joy. Her white hand waved, in Cynthia's silver light, The sign of welcome from the barrier-height: Her soft voice chid his steps estranged so long; Condemned and mourned her tyrant father's wrong; Told, how, allured by wealth's fallacious charms, He doomed a lordly bridegroom to her arms; Yet rather far she wished with him to rove, Share his hard meal, and bless his faithful love. With rapturous hope he heard her accents fall. Her gliding steps forsook the terraced wall: She passed the postern-gate, the green-sward pressed, Sprang o'er the turf, and sunk upon his breast. No steed was theirs, with steady swiftness strong, To urge their flight the mountain-glens along. Love lent them speed. The conscious moon alone Beheld their path, and heard their genius moan. Swift on the wind-swept crag their steps imprest Winged the soft hours of man's oblivious rest. The dripping morn rose dark, and wild, and cold: The heavy clouds in denser volumes rolled: The gathering blast pealed forth a voice of dread, Tossed the light larch, and bent the cedar's head: A wild response the echoing caverns gave: The rain-swoln torrent rolled a yellower wave: Far on the storm was borne the eagle's scream: Still hope was theirs, and love's celestial beam. High-poised in air, where mightier summits towered, Where from his clouds the mountain-genius lowered, A frozen mass of tempest-loosened snow Shook to the blast, and menaced all below. In silent awe they gazed: that only way Through those deep glens and lonely dingles lay. Safe seemed the path, beyond the turbid surge, If once their steps might pass the dangerous verge, Where o'er the chasm, immeasurably deep, The rude pine-bridge was thrown from steep to steep. Still, as they went, the frantic torrent swelled, And louder gusts along the dingles yelled. Like some prophetic spirit's mournful cry, Pealed from the caves the echo's wild reply. They pressed the bridge: at once the whirlwind's force Hurled the vast ruin down its thundering course. Even while the woods, with sudden tumult rent, Announced the havoc of its first descent, One speaking glance the sad farewell declared: One last embrace the maddening moment shared: Thus in the sanctuary of love enshrined, In tenderest links inseparably twined, Blest in one fate, they met the whelming shock, That crushed the pine, and rent the eternal rock. The raving stream, in wilder eddies swayed, Engulphed the wreck the mighty impulse made: And o'er the tomb of love, too soon o'erthrown, The genius of the mountains frowned alone.

ANALYSIS OF THE THIRD PART The sorrows of mutual love are mingled with a delightful sensation, far preferable to the cold tranquillity of the Stoic, the apathy of the hermit, and the selfish gratifications of the proud.

The retrospective attachment, which dwells on the memory of the dead, is mingled with a melancholy pleasure, unknown to those with whom the partiality of the hour effaces all former impressions.

If e'er in woodland shade, by Cynfael's urn, Thy altar saw my votive incense burn, May thy propitious star, thy deathless flower, Illume my path, and twine my rustic bower. May that fair form, ah! now too far remote! Whose glossy locks on ocean-breezes float; That tender voice, whose rapture-breathing thrill, Unheard so long, in fancy vibrates still; That Parian hand, that draws, with artless fire, The soul of music from her mountain-lyre; Led by thy planet from the billowy shore, Resume these groves, and never leave them more. Then let the torrent rage, the meteor fly, The storm-cloud blacken in December's sky! Love's syren voice, and music's answering shell, Shall cheer the simple genius of our cell: The plaintive minstrel's legendary strain One added charm of softest power shall gain, When she, whose breast thy purest fount supplies, Bids thy own songs, oh melancholy! rise. The tear, that drops on undeserved distress,— The pitying sigh, that ever breathes to bless,— With mingling spell, the sweetest concords find, That heaven can wake in man's ethereal mind. See, in her cot, the widowed mother mourn O'er blighted hopes, and famished babes forlorn: See the low latchet rise, the door expand, The Man of Ross extend his bounteous hand: Mark the quick light the mother's eye that fires, The smile her child's responsive cheek respires: Hear the wild thanks, by grateful phrensy given, That waft deep blessings to recording heaven. Lo! on his bed of straw the captive pines, Where through the creviced wall sad twilight shines. Mid the pale gloom, where, chained in care, he sits, Departed joy, a sullen spectre, flits, His wasted hand with hopeless sorrow rears The mournful record of his lingering years. At once, the locks resound, the bars give way, The opening door admits the distant day: His dazzled eyes his guardian genius see: He hears an angel speak, while Howard says, Be free! See the grey wanderer, in the evening vale, Shrink from the rain, and bend beneath the gale. Hopeless he hears the kindred tempest roar Round lordly pride's inhospitable door, But hails with joy the taper's simple blaze, That through the cottage-casement streams its rays. There, by the social fire to warmth restored, For him the housewife spreads her frugal board, For him the good man's homely vintage flows, Rich in those sweets that pity only knows. Thus Park, alone mid Afric's swarthy sons, Through barbarous realms where mighty Niger runs, Outraged by kings, and plundered by the great, Sunk at the sable peasant's pitying gate. There female kindness brought her simple store, And dropt soft balsam on the wounds he bore. O'er him compassion waked her tenderest strain, Who knew no mother to relieve his pain, No wife, to watch the paths he used to roam, Spread the wild fruits, and hail her wanderer home. These are thy triumphs, sacred nymph of tears! These the blest wreathes thy lonely myrtle rears! The drooping leaves, round virtue's urn that spread, The grateful thought, that sojourns with the dead, Possess a nobler charm, a stronger tie, Than all the world's unfeeling joys supply. He knows them not, whose love's fantastic flower Falls with the varying zephyr of the hour. When the worn pilgrim turns to press the soil, On which fond memory dwelt through all his toil, How thrills his heart, while every breeze he hears Recalls the playmates of his tender years! The ivied tower, by sportive childhood climbed, The fairy grove, by hope's first dream sublimed, The laurel-shade, where love's young sigh was breathed, The woodbine-bower, by mutual ardor wreathed, The cataract-rocks, where lonely fancy roved, The twilight-path confiding friendship loved,— The thoughts, the tales, of parted times restore, That one thought is suggested to the mind by another, and that the sight of an external object often recalls former occurrences, and revives former feelings, are facts perfectly familiar, even to those who are least disposed to speculate concerning the principles of their nature. In passing along a road which we have formerly travelled in the company of a friend, the particulars of the conversation in which we were then engaged are frequently suggested to us by the objects we meet with. In such a scene we recollect that such a particular subject was started; and in passing the different houses, and plantations, and rivers, the arguments we were discussing when we last saw them recur spontaneously to the memory. . . . After time has in some degree reconciled us to the death of a friend, how wonderfully are we affected the first time we enter the house where he lived! Every thing we see, the apartment where he studied, the chair upon which he sate, recall to us the happiness we enjoyed together; and we should feel it a sort of violation of that respect which we owe to his memory, to engage in any light or indifferent discourse, when such objects are before us. Stewart's Philosophy of the Mind. And wake the forms his eye must hail no more. Sweet sorrow sings in every breeze that bends The church-yard grass that shrouds his earliest friends, And heaven looks down to bless the falling tear Of filial duty on a parent's bier. On Media's hills the evening sun was low: The lake's wide surface flashed a golden glow; Where the still clouds their crimson glory gave In full reflection from the trembling wave. The little surge scarce murmured on the shore. Far on the air Araxes rolled his roar. The soft breeze waved the light acacia's bower, And wafted fragrance from the citron flower. His pensive path Abdallah chanced to take Along the margin of that beauteous lake, By science led o'er wildest hills to roam, And cull their sweets to grace his studious home. And well he deemed a day's long toil repaid, If one young blossom he had ne'er surveyed, Or unknown herb, his curious search might find. Thus while he roamed, with contemplative mind, The turning rock disclosed a wondrous scene: A myrtle grove, in summer's loveliest green: A blossomed lawn: an hermit cave beside: A central tree, in solitary pride. Even while he gazed on that strange plant, he felt, As if amidst its leaves some genius dwelt, Some musing spirit, whose diffusive power Shed deeper awe on placid evening's hour. Still, science-led, he pressed the lonely plain, And stretched his hand the offering bough to gain. Then first an urn, with recent flowerets dressed, His gaze attracted, and his touch repressed: On whose broad pedestal a tablet said: Respect these branches, nor profane the dead. Congealed he stood, in statue-like surprise, Fixed on the plant his wonder-beaming eyes, And heard the gale, that played its leaves around, Wake, as it passed, a wild unearthly sound. Thus while he paused, a footstep smote his ear: He turned, and saw a grey-haired stranger near, Whom years had bowed beneath their lengthened load: Yet in his reverend features gently glowed The deep, sublime tranquillity of soul, That fate shakes not, nor time's supreme control. He spoke, and mildly-sweet his accents fell, Sweet as the wafted note of evening-bell, Whose slow swing strikes the weary traveller's ear, ? lo nuovo peregrin d' amore Punge, se ode squilla di lontano, Che paja il giorno pianger che si muore. Dante: Purgatorio, viii. Pr. Awakes the thought of home, and tells of shelter near: “Stranger! the urn those solemn branches shade Nursed that fair tree, now monarch of the glade. Within its boughs a spirit dwells enshrined, And sheds blest influence on the musing mind. “In early youth I lost my hallowed sire: I laid his body on the funeral pyre, Placed in that urn the ashes of his clay, And left them free to Mithra's holy ray. The warm ray fell: the summer-dews came down: The forest-verdure changed to russet brown: The dry leaves dropped: the wintry tempest past. When spring's mild gale dispelled the freezing blast, That solemn plant, my ever-sacred trust, Sprang from my heaven-loved parent's genial dust. ?les feux du soleil commençoient à embraser l'horison: l'inconnu, appercevant un arbre isolé, proposa à Orondal de s'arrêter un moment sous son ombrage.—Cette idée m'enchante, dit le vieillard: cet arbre m'est cher, plus que tu ne penses: c'est mon pere.—Votre pere!—Jeune homme, écoute-moi. Je n'ai point cru outrager la nature, en faisant servir la cendre d'un pere à la génération des êtres: j'osai l'exposer au soleil, renfermée dans son urne, et couverte d'un crystal léger, qui, sans s'opposer au contact de l'air, arrêtoit les graines étrangeres qui auroient pu végéter sur sa surface: tous les jours j'arrosai cette cendre précieuse avec de l'eau, portée par l'alembic à son dernier degré de pureté: enfin, les principes de vie que l'urne renfermoit se développèrent, et je vis naître une plante que la botanique ne rangeroit dans aucune de ses classes. Cette plante périt, et eut une postérité, dont la cendre augmenta le volume du limon générateur: au bout d'un certain nombre d'années, les principes de vie acquirent plus d'activité: la plante devint arbuste: et aujourd'hui c'est un arbre qui le dispute en hauteur aux plus beaux cèdres de ces déserts. Philosophie de la Nature. Not long that narrow urn its strength could rear: I raised it from its bed, and fixed it here. Sweet was the task to watch its spreading stem, And every infant bud's expanding gem. “O stranger! oft, beneath its shade reclined, I hear my father, on the evening wind, Breathe, in pure accents of celestial truth, The sacred lore that trained my tender youth. Soon by his urn shall my old bones be laid, And sweetly sleep in his protecting shade.” PART IV ? ???, ????? ??? ???? ???? ?????????? ?????? ??? ????. ?????????. ANALYSIS OF THE FOURTH PART The beneficial effects, resulting from the perpetual mutability of things to moral and physical nature, demonstrate the wisdom and the necessity of its existence. The Sybarite and the mountaineer contrasted. Virtue, genius, and courage, shine with additional splendor through darkness and adversity. Virtue: exemplified in Thrasea: Genius: in Orpheus, Dante, and Ariosto: Courage: in Scipio and Odin. The energy and sublimity of character, which distinguished the latter, and the votaries of his wild mythology, ought still more to distinguish those, who have truth and science for their guides. Conclusion. When the brief joys fallacious fortune gave Have passed, like foam from ocean's crested wave; When friends are false, and love's pale lips repose In the last home the earthly wanderer knows; The vernal sunshine, and the opening flower, Diffuse no smile around the mourner's bower. See the man, who is informed of some severe and unexpected misfortune, who is deprived of a wife whom he loves, or of a child whom paternal affection had made the object of the fondest wishes. In an instant, his ideas take a new course. The world around him is overspread with gloom. Every thing lends itself to his grief. The cheerful sunshine, which soon may pass away, brings a mournful recollection to his soul; and he sighs, in contemplating the bloom of youth, which has lately flourished, and which must shortly fade. For him there is no joy in scenes of festivity and mirth; no allurement in the attractions of society; and no interest in the pursuits of ambition. He hears not the voice of consolation: he indulges and encourages his sorrow. It is not, until some sentiment, secretly approved, has whispered to him, that he may yet find solace in the pleasures of the world, that he discovers grief to be unavailing, and solitude to be irksome: he yields to the impulse of sentiment, and vaunts the exercise of reason. Drummond's Academical Questions. Cheerless to him the flower that blooms to fade, And sad the radiance clouds so soon must shade. Yet shall the hand of time assuage his pain, And changeful nature charm his soul again. Divine the law, that gives our earthly state Its shifting seasons, and its varying fate. Spring, never broken by the storm's control, Had thrown Lethean torpor on the soul. See the soft youth, in pleasure's bower reclined, Shrink from the breath of autumn's evening wind: Mark, where yon rocks the tempest dimly shrouds, The mountain-hunter bounding through the clouds. The enlightened breast, with native virtue warm, Glows in the toil of fortune's wildest storm. The eye, that views, in wisdom's guiding light, The feeble tenure of terrestrial might, Learns, undismayed, the tyrant's brow to scan, And rise victorious o'er the power of man; As Thrasea smiled, expiring in his grove, And poured libations to delivering Jove. Thrasea was a stoic philosopher, condemned by Nero for his inflexible virtue. When his veins were opened, he sprinkled the blood on the ground, as a libation to Liberating Jupiter. Libemus, inquit, Jovi Liberatori. From deepest night creative genius brings The brightest flow of her exhaustless springs. So Orpheus rose, with heaven-illumined mind, To teach the arts of life, and form mankind. Silvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum Cædibus et victu fœdo deterruit Orpheus. Horatius. When Europe sunk in barbarous darkness lay; When outraged science streamed no genial ray; While murder fired her sacrilegious pile, And phrensy brooded in the cloistered aisle; Like light from chaos Alighieri sprung: And Leo lived, and Ariosto sung. More firm in danger, courage stands unfurled, A beacon-tower, to guide and awe the world. Thus youthful Scipio raised his patriot shield, When Rome's pale genius wept on Cannæ's field, After the fatal battle of Cannæ, when the noblest of the Romans meditated to forsake their country, and offer their services to some foreign king, Scipio rushed, with a few followers, into the council, which was held with this design; and drawing his sword in the assembly, declared, that he would neither desert the republic, nor suffer any other citizen to desert it; and that whosoever should refuse to swear implicit conformity to this patriotic resolution, might know that against him that sword was drawn. Ex mei animi sententia, inquit, ut ego rempublicam populi Romani non deseram, neque alium civem Romanum deserere patiar. Si sciens fallo, tum me, Jupiter optime maxime, domum, familiam, remque meam, pessimo leto adficias. In hœc verba, L. Cœcili, jures postulo, ceterique, qui adestis: qui non juraverit, in se hunc gladium strictum esse sciat. The oath was unanimously taken, and the republic was preserved by Scipio in its most dreadful extremity. Stood like a rock, his native walls to save, And rolled away the madly-threatening wave. When Pompey's arms, on Asia's vanquished strand, Forced many a prince to yield his parent land, Dark Odin drew his chosen warriors forth, Till the end of the eleventh century, a celebrated temple subsisted at Upsal, the most considerable town of the Swedes and Goths. It was enriched with the gold which the Scandinavians had acquired in their piratical adventures, and sanctified by the uncouth representations of the three principal deities, the god of war, the goddess of generation, and the god of thunder. In the general festival, that was solemnized every ninth year, nine animals of every species (without excepting the human) were sacrificed, and their bleeding bodies suspended in the sacred grove, adjacent to the temple. The only traces that now subsist of this barbaric superstition are contained in the Edda, a system of mythology, compiled in Iceland about the thirteenth century, and studied by the learned of Denmark and Sweden, as the most valuable remains of their ancient traditions. Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity of the Edda, we can easily distinguish two persons confounded under the name of Odin, the god of war, and the great legislator of Scandinavia. The latter, the Mahomet of the north, instituted a religion adapted to the climate, and to the people. Numerous tribes on either side of the Baltic were subdued by the invincible valor of Odin, by his persuasive eloquence, and by the fame, which he acquired, of a most skilful magician. The faith that he had propagated, during a long and prosperous life, he confirmed by a voluntary death. Apprehensive of the ignominious approach of disease and infirmity, he resolved to expire as became a warrior. In a solemn assembly of the Swedes and Goths, he wounded himself in nine mortal places, hastening away (as he asserted with his dying voice) to prepare the feast of heroes in the palace of the god of war. The native and proper habitation of Odin is distinguished by the appellation of Asgard. The happy resemblance of that name with As-burg, or As-of, words of a similar signification, has given rise to an historical system of so pleasing a contexture, that we could almost wish to persuade ourselves of its truth. It is supposed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians, which dwelt on the banks of the lake Mæotis, till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with servitude. That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist, conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden, with the great design of forming, in that inaccessible retreat of freedom, a religion and a people, which in some remote age might be subservient to his immortal revenge; when his invincible Goths, armed with martial fanaticism, should issue in numerous swarms from the neighbourhood of the Polar circle, to chastise the oppressors of mankind. Gibbon's Roman Empire. And bade them follow to the distant north. O'er its vast course, unconquerably strong, The rapid flame of battle blazed along, Rushed o'er the hill, and swept across the plain, While barbarous nations stemmed its rage in vain: Even as the lightning-brand, from sounding skies, With sudden impulse bursts, and strikes, and flies, But leaves the dreadful vestige of its shock Impressed for ever on the blasted rock. Grande ma breve fulmine il diresti, Che inaspettato sopraggiunga, e passi: Ma del suo corso momentaneo resti Vestigio eterno in dirupati sassi. Tasso. Then, in the shade of victory's waving wings, He rolled his wheels o'er Scandinavian kings. When flying years had crowned his toil sublime, And spread his sway o'er all the northern clime, By the grey hills, where ancient Torneo roars, He called his chiefs from all his subject shores: There to his breast nine circling wounds he gave, And sung, while swiftly flowed the crimson wave: “Beyond that snow-capped mountain's utmost ridge, Where the firm rain-bow throws its radiant bridge, O'er high Valhalla's dome my standard flies, The following illustrations of this passage are extracted from different parts of the Edda and the Northern Antiquities. The way from earth to heaven is over the bridge Bifrost, which men call the rain-bow. It is of three colors, is extremely solid, and constructed with more art than any work in the world. It will nevertheless be broken in pieces, when the genii of fire sally forth to war. Asgard is the city, and Valhalla the hall of Odin, where he receives the souls of heroes who perish in battle. Their beverage is beer and mead; their cups the skulls of enemies whom they have slain. Valhalla has one hundred and forty gates, through every one of which eight heroes may march abreast. Heimdaller is a very sacred and powerful deity. He dwells at the end of the bridge Bifrost, in a castle called the celestial fort. He is the centinel, or watchman, of the gods. The post assigned him is at the entry into heaven, to prevent the giants from forcing their way over the bridge. He sleeps less than a bird. He sees by night, as well as by day, more than a hundred leagues around him. The smallest sound does not escape him; and he has a trumpet, which is heard through all the worlds. Thor is the most valiant of the sons of Odin, the most warlike and formidable of the gods. His weapon is the mace Miolner, which he grasps with gauntlets of iron. He governs the thunder, the winds, the rains, the fair weather, and the harvest. Hilda is one of the Valkyræ. These goddesses officiate in Valhalla, pouring out ale and mead for the heroes. Odin sends them into the field of battle, to make choice of those who are to be slain, and to bestow the victory. Nilflhil is a place consisting of nine worlds, reserved for those who die of disease or old age. Hela, or Death, there exercises her despotic power. She is livid and ghastly pale: the threshold of her door is Precipice; her palace Anguish; her table Famine; and her attendants Expectation and Delay. Surtur is the prince of the genii of fire. In the twilight of the gods, the army of these genii will pass on horseback over the bridge of heaven, and break it in pieces. Heimdaller will then rise up, and violently sound his trumpet, to call the gods and heroes to battle. And Asgard's hundred gates and towers arise. There, at his post, Heimdaller sits to hear My sounding tread salute his watchful ear. There Thor, the thunderer, throws his distant gaze, And mourns, that still his absent sire delays. Even now I hear the portal-gates unfurled, To hail their king returning from the world. There the twelve sisters, rulers of the fight, Pour forth the mead, that flows in sparkling light: That mead, which every hero's soul shall cheer, Who loves the din of danger's wild career, Burns through the field, a glory-beaming star, And falls, the victim of his country's war. But woe to him, whose trembling spirits shrink To tempt the strife on terror's dizziest brink: Him shall avenging Hilda hurl in pain To endless frost, and Nilflhil's dire domain. The brave, the brave, my glorious feast shall share, And drown in joy all trace of earthly care, Till the wild trump, from Bifrost's echoing arch, Rings to the tread of Surtur's fiery march: That signal-blast shall every warrior hear, Brace his tried shield, and grasp his ancient spear; Breathe loud defiance through his clarion's mouth, And meet with me the dæmons of the south.” The wondrous tale his eager chiefs received, And subject nations listened, and believed. Then grew the soul, that joyed in coming strife, Reckless of fate, and prodigal of life. And when, in peace and luxury enchained, The splendid name of Rome alone remained, At once, from all their hills, with tempest-frown, The countless hosts of Odin's sons came down, A wasting torrent, on her fruitful plains: As from the mountain's head, when vernal rains Dissolve the snow, and roll the turbid rills Along the hundred channels of the hills, Through the deep glen the mingling waters pour, ?? ????? ????????? ???????, ???? ?????? ???????, ?? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ????, ??????? ?? ????????, ?????? ??????? ????????? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ?????? ?? ??????? ????? ??????. ??????. Send to the shepherd's ear a dreadful roar, Then through the vale in one vast deluge flow, Involving, whirling, spoiling, as they go. Long have the moss, the mildew, and the rain, Worn the grey lines on Odin's Runic fane: Yet there the brave may read, with hopes elate, 'Twas valor, rising in the storms of fate, Whose dauntless thought the mighty source supplied, Which rolled that flood on Rome's imperial pride. And shall the savage faith, by phrensy taught, Nerve the wild spirit with all-conquering thought, While polished man, by sacred science led, Shrinks in the blast, and bends his weary head? No! let the mind, that pious truth inspires, The mind, that wisdom wakes, that feeling fires, Soar, on the wings of that ethereal flame, By nature kindled in its infant frame, To elemental light's all-circling sphere, Triumphant o'er the ills that wound it here. Oh mourner! learn thy transient griefs to bear: For heaven is wronged, when virtue feels despair. Check not the tear, along thy cheek that steals: But let thy heart endure the woes it feels. Fortune and fate may give, and may resume: Yet love's lost treasure sleeps not in the tomb. No more with earth-directed eyes complain: But bow to him whose mercy sends thee pain. Hark! in his cave the Thracian minstrel sings, And Hebrus listens as he sweeps the strings: “From him all beings wake, in him they rest, The first, the last, the wisest, and the best.

ADVERTISEMENT The worship of fire was universal in the first ages. When lost or corrupted in other nations, it was still preserved in its purity among the disciples of Zoroaster. Under the successors of Mohammed, the religion of the Magi fell before that of the Moslems: though a small and obscure remnant of the former sect still subsists in the East. In this ode, I attribute to Mohammed in person the subversion of the Magian fanes. The prophet of Arabia, propagating his new religion by the force of arms, is represented, as having entered the principal temple of the divinity of fire, and, after overturning the exterior altars, attempting to penetrate the sanctuary of the mystic flame. STROPHE I. Beneath the warrior's iron tread The violated altars lie, Where dateless years the rites have led Of fire's primeval deity. O'er trampled priests Mohammed flies, Where the interior portals rise The exterior temple is here a work of art, and the interior a natural cave. Men repaired in the first ages either to the lonely summits of mountains, or else to caverns in the rocks, and hollows in the bosom of the earth, which they fancied were the residence of their gods. At the entrance of these, they raised their altars, and performed their vows. . . . When, in process of time, they began to erect temples, they were still determined in their situation by the vicinity of these objects, which they comprehended within the limits of the sacred enclosure. . . . Amongst the Persians, most of the temples were caverns in rocks, either formed by nature, or artificially produced. Bryant's Ancient Mythology. From gaze profane and uninitiate feet To guard the symbol-flame's retreat, That, changeless there from unremembered days, Pours through the hallowed cave its lonely rays. He strikes the marble doors: The temple's rocky floors Resound, as from the opening cavern streams A blaze of vivid white, Pure as the pallid light O'er hills of snow when wintry morning beams. With instantaneous change, the splendor dread Expanding glows intensely red, A similar change, from a similar cause, occurs in the Paradiso of Dante, C. xxvii. Dinanzi agli occhi miei le quattro face Stavano accese, e quella che pria venne Incominciò a farsi più vivace; E tal nella sembianza sua divenne, Qual diverrebbe Giove, s'egli e Marte Fossero augelli e cambiassersi penne. Di quel color, che per lo sole avverso Nube dipinge da sera e da mane, Vid' io allora tutto il ciel cosperso. As when the autumnal day's descending star Shrouds in the infant storm its crimson-beaming car. ANTISTROPHE I. As back the jarring portals swung, As forth that flame repellent broke, A voice, from mid the radiance flung, In thrilling accents sternly spoke: And darest thou deem, thy arms accursed, Thy laws in strife and carnage nursed, Can long in dust my sacred altars whelm? The breast-plate and the crested helm My breath could pierce, and through thy every vein Pour burning death and agonising pain:— Awhile the fates severe Decree thy triumph here: Enjoy thy hour, and stamp in blood thy laws. I sink to caves of night: To burst with tenfold might, Consume thy race, and vindicate my cause, And re-assume alone the rites divine, That in the infant world were mine, When, wheresoever man, the wanderer, turned, Beneath unnumbered names my votive altars burned.

This is farther proved from a well known verse in Ovid: Nec tu aliud Vestam, quam vivam intellige flammam. Bryant's Ancient Mythology. The worship of solar or vestal fire may be ascribed, like that of Osiris and Isis, to an enthusiastic admiration of nature's wonderful powers; and it seems, as far as I can yet understand the Vedas, to be the principal worship recommended in them. We have seen, that Mahadeva himself is personified by fire; but subordinate to him is the god Agni, often called Pavaca, or the purifier, who answers to the Vulcan of Egypt. Sir William Jones.

O'er this ball, in night revolving, Frost, and central silence, dwelt; Till, the mighty mass dissolving, My creative power was felt: Then first the vivifying ray, Pouring through heaven the streams of day, Dispelled young nature's immemorial sleep, Bade the woods wave, the lucid torrents play, And burst the icy fetters of the deep.

The midnight seaman marks afar The terrors of my mountain-throne, ???????? ???? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ????????, ????? ???????????? ???? ??????? ?????, ????????? ??????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????. ????????. Where, rousing earth's intestine war, I sit, mid nature's wrecks, alone. A fiery column rears on high My darkly-volumed canopy, Whose waving folds, deep-tinged with lurid light, Gleam like the funeral robe of night. Old ocean shrinks, A volcanic eruption is generally preceded by a great recession of the sea. and earth convulsive rends, While fast and far the fiery shower descends; And down the mountain-verge The crimson cataract's surge Rolls with impetuous force and thundering sound, Hurls in ascending steam The dissipated stream, And sinks the woods in whitening ashes round; Till, mid the homes of men, the billows red Involve the dying and the dead, In general havoc sweeping from the soil Vineyards, and fanes, and towers, the pride of earthly toil. EPODE II. Mark yon city's ancient glory, Through revolving ages reared; Long the theme of deathless story, Long by distant lands revered. In vain around her bulwarks lower The legions of the adverse power, Till at my shrine the suppliant hymn they raise. Then comes the triumph of my conquering hour: Her portals tremble, and her temples blaze: Her long dominion of unnumbered years One dreadful day to endless ruin dooms. In after times the pensive wanderer hears The shrill breeze whistle o'er unhonored tombs, Where mid her prostrate walls the purple heath-flower blooms. STROPHE III. Yet wisdom in my wasting course May still the trace of bounty find. Even in my most destructive force, I ever loved and blessed mankind. Yon harbinger of fate, that flies Portentous through the midnight skies, Bears life and splendor to the orb of heaven, Some fanciful theorists have supposed, that comets are masses of combustible matter, destined to renovate the flames of the sun. From whose pure fount to man are given The dearest blessings of his transient day. What though, when impious nations scorn my sway, From cliff to cliff I raise The beacon's dreadful blaze, And through their conflagrated dwellings rave; Yet from my parent urn The springs of glory burn, That guide the wise, and animate the brave. Thence glows the vestal-torch, whose power refined Awakes, expands, illumes the mind: Thence the soft rays, through pity's tears that stream; And friendship's guardian light, and love's ethereal beam. ANTISTROPHE III. Though in the dread volcanic tide The floods of devastation roll, Yet thence to mortals are supplied New gifts of my benign control. While with incumbent ocean's rage Fierce strife my fountain-torrents wage, Rocks piled on rocks amid the conflict rise. Formation of islands by submarine volcanoes. The wondering mariner descries Their fire-scorched summits frowning o'er the wave, And hears with awe the unwonted breakers rave. Amid those lonely dells My plastic influence dwells, Till rivers burst, and forests clothe the isle; And, where the stormy breeze Late howled o'er shoreless seas, Man rears his home, and friendly harbours smile. My bounty dies, when man my fane forsakes. Alone my brooding vengeance wakes. Deep in my subterranean domes enfurled, I gather up my force to overwhelm the world. EPODE III. Tremble, sons of future ages! Tremble at the emblemed doom, When the red volcano rages, When the meteor fires the gloom, When the thunder-brand of heaven On the mountain-tower is driven. In these let earth my sleepless might behold: In these the signals of my wrath be given. In final hour shall my vast waves be rolled Round this revolving planetary frame; And, while terrestrial nature shrinks and dies, The mighty torrent of eternal flame, In one wide ruin sounding through the skies, Shall bid o'er all the world my lonely altar rise. Communis mundo superest rogus, is the common doctrine of the East, the West, and the North. SIR HORNBOOK; OR, Childe Launcelot's Expedition. I. O'er bush and briar Childe Launcelot sprung Childe, in our old ballads, often signifies a knight. With ardent hopes elate, And loudly blew the horn that hung Before Sir Hornbook's gate. The inner portals opened wide, And forward strode the chief, Arrayed in paper helmet's pride, And arms of golden leaf. —“What means,”—he cried,—“this daring noise, That wakes the summer day? I hate all idle truant boys: Away, Sir Childe, away!”— —“No idle, truant boy am I,”— Childe Launcelot answered straight; —“Resolved to climb this hill so high, I seek thy castle gate. “Behold the talisman I bear, And aid my bold design:”— Sir Hornbook gazed, and written there, Knew Emulation's sign. “If Emulation sent thee here,” Sir Hornbook quick replied, “My merrymen all shall soon appear, To aid thy cause with shield and spear, And I will head thy bold career, And prove thy faithful guide.”— Loud rung the chains; the drawbridge fell; The gates asunder flew: The knight thrice beat the portal bell, And thrice he call'd “Halloo.” And out, and out, in hasty rout, By ones, twos, threes, and fours; His merrymen rush'd the walls without, And stood before the doors. II. Full six and twenty men were they, There are twenty-six letters, A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I. J. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. U. V. W. X. Y. Z. In line of battle spread: The first that came was mighty A, The last was little Z. Six Vocal men Sir Hornbook had, Of these are vowels, a. e. i. o. u. y. Four Double men to boot, Four are double letters, j. w. x. z. And four were Liquids soft and sad, Four are liquids, l. m. n. r. And all the rest were Mute. And twelve are mutes, b. c. d. f. g. h. k. p. q. s. t. v. He called his Corporal, Syllable, A syllable is a distinct sound of one or more letters pronounced in a breath. To range the scatter'd throng; And Captain Word dispos'd them well Words are articulate sounds used by common consent, as signs of our ideas. In bands compact and strong. —“Now mark, Sir Childe,”—Sir Hornbook said:— “These well-compacted powers, Shall lead thy vent'rous steps to tread Through all the Muses' bowers, “If rightly thou thyself address, To use their proffer'd aid: Still unallur'd by idleness, By labor undismay'd; “For many troubles intervene, And perils widely spread, Around the groves of evergreen, That crown this mountain's head: But rich reward he finds, I ween, Who through them all has sped.”— Childe Launcelot felt his bosom glow At thought of noble deed; Resolved through every path to go, Where that bold knight should lead. Sir Hornbook wound his bugle horn, Full long, and loud, and shrill; His merrymen all, for conquest born, With armour glittering to the morn, Went marching up the hill. III. —“What men are you beside the way?”— The bold Sir Hornbook cried: —“My name is The, my brother's A,”— Sir Article replied. There are two articles, the, definite; a or an, indefinite. “My brother's home is any where, The indefinite article is used generally and indeterminately to point out one single thing of a kind: as, “There is a dog;” “Give me an orange.” At large and undefin'd; But I a preference ever bear The definite article defines and specifies particular objects: as, “Those are the men;”—“Give me the book.” For one fix'd spot, and settle there; Which speaks my constant mind.” —“What ho! Childe Launcelot! seize them there, And look you have them sure!”— —Sir Hornbook cried,—“my men shall bear Your captives off secure.”— The twain were seized: Sir Hornbook blew His bugle loud and shrill: His merrymen all, so stout and true, Went marching up the hill. IV. And now a wider space they gained, A steeper, harder ground, Where by one ample wall contained, All earthly things they found: A noun is the name of whatsoever thing or being we see or discourse of. All beings, rich, poor, weak, or wise, Were there, full strange to see, And attributes and qualities Of high and low degree. Before the circle stood a knight, Sir Substantive his name, Nouns are of two kinds, substantives and adjectives. A noun substantive declares its own meaning, and requires not another word to be joined with it to show its signification; as, man, book, apple. With Adjective, his lady bright, Who seemed a portly dame; Yet only seemed; for whensoe'er She strove to stand alone, A noun adjective cannot stand alone, but always requires to be joined with a substantive, of which it shows the nature or quality, as, “a good girl,”—“a naughty boy.” She proved no more than smoke and air, Who looked like flesh and bone. And therefore to her husband's arm She clung for evermore, And lent him many a grace and charm He had not known before; Yet these the knight felt well advised, He might have done without; For lightly foreign help he prized, He was so staunch and stout. Five sons had they, their dear delight, Of different forms and faces; And two of them were Numbers bright, Nouns have two numbers, singular and plural;— And three they christened Cases. and three cases: nominative, possessive, and objective. Now loudly rung Sir Hornbook's horn; Childe Launcelot poised his spear; And on they rushed, to conquest borne, In swift and full career. Sir Substantive kicked down the wall: It fell with furious rattle: And earthly things and beings all Rushed forth to join the battle. But earthly things and beings all, Though mixed in boundless plenty, Must one by one dissolving fall To Hornbook's six-and-twenty. Childe Launcelot won the arduous fray, And, when they ceased from strife, Led stout Sir Substantive away, His children, and his wife. Sir Hornbook wound his horn again, Full long, and loud, and shrill: His merrymen all, a warlike train, Went marching up the hill. V. Now when Sir Pronoun look'd abroad, A pronoun is used instead of a noun, and may be considered its locum tenens, or deputy: as, “The King is gone to Windsor, he will return to-morrow.” And spied the coming train, He left his fort beside the road, And ran with might and main. Two cloth-yard shafts from I and U, Went forth with whizzing sound: Like lightning sped the arrows true; Sir Pronoun pressed the ground: But darts of science ever flew To conquer, not to wound. His fear was great: his hurt was small: Childe Launcelot took his hand: —“Sir Knight,”—said he,—“though doomed to fall Before my conquering band, “Yet knightly treatment shall you find, On faith of cavalier: Then join Sir Substantive behind, And follow our career.”— Sir Substantive, that man of might, Felt knightly anger rise; For he had marked Sir Pronoun's flight With no approving eyes. “Great Substantive, my sovereign liege!”— Thus sad Sir Pronoun cried, —“When you had fallen in furious siege, Could I the shock abide?” “That all resistance would be vain, Too well, alas! I knew: For what could I, when you were ta'en, Your poor lieutenant, do?” Then louder rung Sir Hornbook's horn, In signals long and shrill: His merrymen all, for conquest born, Went marching up the hill. VI. Now steeper grew the rising ground, And rougher grew the road, As up the steep ascent they wound To bold Sir Verb's abode. A verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as, “I am, I love, I am loved.” Sir Verb was old, and many a year, All scenes and climates seeing, Had run a wild and strange career Through every mode of being. And every aspect, shape, and change Of action, and of passion: And known to him was all the range Of feeling, taste, and fashion. He was an Augur, quite at home In all things present done, The two lines in Italics are taken from Chapman's Homer. Deeds past, and every act to come In ages yet to run. Entrenched in intricacies strong, Ditch, fort, and palisado, He marked with scorn the coming throng, And breathed a bold bravado: —“Ho! who are you that dare invade My turrets, moats, and fences? Soon will your vaunting courage fade, When on the walls, in lines array'd, You see me marshal undismay'd My host of moods and tenses.”— Verbs have five moods: The indicative, imperative, potential, subjunctive, and infinitive. —“In vain,”—Childe Launcelot cried in scorn,— —“On them is your reliance;”— Sir Hornbook wound his bugle horn, And twang'd a loud defiance. They swam the moat, they scal'd the wall, Sir Verb, with rage and shame, Beheld his valiant general fall, Infinitive by name. The infinitive mood expresses a thing in a general and unlimited manner: as, “To love, to walk, to be ruled.” Indicative declar'd the foes The indicative mood simply indicates or declares a thing: as, “He loves:” “he is loved:” or asks a question: as, “Does he love?”—“Is he loved?” Should perish by his hand; And stout Imperative arose, The imperative mood commands or entreats: as, “Depart:” “Come hither:“—“Forgive me.” The squadron to command. Potential The potential mood implies possibility or obligation: as, “It may rain:”—“They should learn.” and Subjunctive The subjunctive mood implies contingency: as, “If he were good, he would be happy.” then Came forth with doubt The potential mood implies possibility or obligation: as, “It may rain:”—“They should learn.” and chance: The subjunctive mood implies contingency: as, “If, he were good, he would be happy.” All fell alike, with all their men, Before Sir Hornbook's lance. Action and Passion nought could do To save Sir Verb from fate; Whose doom poor Participle knew, The participle is a certain form of the verb, and is so called from participating the nature of a verb and an adjective: as, “he is an admired character; she is a loving child.” He must participate. Then Adverb, who had skulk'd behind, The adverb is joined to verbs, to adjectives, and to other adverbs, to qualify their signification: as, “that is a remarkably swift horse: it is extremely well done.” To shun the mighty jar, Came forward, and himself resign'd A prisoner of war. Three children of Imperative, Full strong, though somewhat small, Next forward came, themselves to give To conquering Launcelot's thrall. Conjunction press'd to join the crowd; A conjunction is a part of speech chiefly used to connect words: as, “King and constitution;” or sentences: as, “I went to the theatre, and saw the new pantomime.” But Preposition swore, A preposition is most commonly set before another word to show its relation to some word or sentence preceding: as, “The fisherman went down the river with his boat.” Conjunctions and Prepositions are for the most part Imperative moods of obsolete verbs: Thus, and signifies add: “John and Peter—John add Peter:”—“The fisherman with his boat—The fisherman, join his boat.” Though Interjection sobb'd aloud, Interjections are words thrown in between the parts of a sentence, to express passions or emotions: as, “Oh! Alas!” That he would go before. Again his horn Sir Hornbook blew, Full long, and loud, and shrill; His merrymen all, so stout and true, Went marching up the hill. VII. Sir Syntax dwelt in thick fir-grove, Syntax is that part of grammar, which treats of the agreement and construction of words in a sentence. All strown with scraps of flowers, I allude to the poetical fragments with which syntax is illustrated. Which he had pluck'd, to please his love, Among the Muses' bowers. His love was gentle Prosody, Prosody is that part of grammar which treats of the true pronunciation of words, and the rules of versification. More fair than morning beam; Who liv'd beneath a flowering tree, Beside a falling stream. And these two claim'd, with high pretence, The whole Parnassian ground, Albeit some little difference Between their taste was found: Sir Syntax he was all for sense, And Prosody for sound. Yet in them both the Muses fair Exceedingly delighted; And thought no earthly thing so rare, That might with that fond twain compare, When they were both united. —“Ho! yield, Sir Syntax!”—Hornbook cried, “This youth must pass thy grove, Led on by me, his faithful guide, In yonder bowers to rove.”— Thereat full much, Sir Syntax said, But found resistance vain: And through his grove Childe Launcelot sped, With all Sir Hornbook's train. They reach'd the tree where Prosody Was singing in the shade: Great joy Childe Launcelot had to see, And hear that lovely maid. Now, onward as they press'd along, Did nought their course oppose; Till full before the martial throng The Muses' gates arose. There Etymology they found, Etymology is that part of grammar, which investigates the roots, or derivation, of words. Who scorn'd surrounding fruits; And ever dug in deepest ground, For old and mouldy Roots. Sir Hornbook took Childe Launcelot's hand, And tears at parting fell: —“Sir Childe,”—he said,—“with all my band I bid you here farewell. “Then wander through these sacred bowers, Unfearing and alone: All shrubs are here, and fruits, and flowers, To happiest climates known.”— Once more his horn Sir Hornbook blew, A parting signal shrill: His merrymen all, so stout and true, Went marching down the hill. Childe Launcelot pressed the sacred ground, With hope's exulting glow; Some future song perchance may sound The wondrous things which there he found, If you the same would know. SIR PROTEUS: A SATIRICAL BALLAD: BY P. M. O'DONOVAN, Esq. ??????? ??? ?????? ??????????. HIC EST, QUEM REQUIRIS! THIS BALLAD IS INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD BYRON, WITH THAT DEEP CONVICTION OF THE HIGH VALUE OF HIS PRAISE AND OF THE FATAL IMPORT OF HIS CENSURE, WHICH MUST NECESSARILY BE IMPRESSED BY THE PROFOUND JUDGMENT WITH WHICH HIS OPINIONS ARE CONCEIVED, THE CALM DELIBERATION WITH WHICH THEY ARE PROMULGATED, THE PROTEAN CONSISTENCY WITH WHICH THEY ARE MAINTAINED, AND THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF ALL UNDUE BIAS ON THEIR FORMATION FROM PRIVATE PARTIALITY OR PERSONAL RESENTMENT: WITH THAT ADMIRATION OF HIS POETICAL TALENTS, WHICH MUST BE UNIVERSALLY AND INEVITABLY FELT FOR VERSIFICATION UNDECORATED WITH THE MERETRICIOUS FASCINATIONS OF HARMONY, FOR SENTIMENTS UNSOPHISTICATED BY THE DELUSIVE ARDOR OF PHILANTHROPY, FOR NARRATIVE ENVELOPED IN ALL THE CIMMERIAN SUBLIMITY OF THE IMPENETRABLE OBSCURE. I. [JOHNNY ON THE SEA.] ILLE EGO Oh! list to me: for I'm about To catch the fire of Chaucer, And spin in doleful measure out The tale of Johnny Raw, sir; Our hero appears to have been “all naked feeling and raw life,” like Arvalan in the Curse of Kehama. Who, bent upon a desperate plan To make the people stare, Set off full speed for Hindoostan Upon Old Poulter's mare. This is the Pegasa of the Cumberland school of poetry. Old Poulter's Mare is the heroine “of one of our old ballads, so full of beauty.” A modern bard, “whose works will be read when Homer and Virgil are forgotten,” was at infinite trouble to procure an imperfect copy of this precious piece of antiquity, and has rescued it from oblivion, si dîs placet, in the pages of Thalaba. Tramp! tramp! across the land he went; Splash! splash! across the sea; And then he gave his bragging After all, perhaps, there is not much bragging in the speech of our hero. He has classical authority for self-panegyric, and, what is still better, the authority of Mr. Southey: Come, listen to a tale of times of old: Come, for ye know me! I am he who sung The Maid of Arc; and I am he who framed Of Thalaba the wild and wondrous song. Come, listen to my lay, and ye shall hear How Madoc, &amp;c. And again: Most righteously thy soul Loathes the black catalogue of human crimes And human misery: let that spirit fill Thy song, and it shall teach thee, boy, to raise Strains such as Cato might have deigned to hear. What degree of pleasure Cato would have derived from the Carmen Triumphale for the year 1814, is a point that remains to be decided. Ranarian minstrels of all ages and nations have entertained a high opinion of their own melody. The Muses of Styx, the ???????? ???????????, have transferred their seat in modern days to the banks of the Northern Lakes, where they inflate their tuneful votaries with inspiration and egotism. O dolce concento! when, to the philosophic wanderer on the twilight shore, ascends from the depths of Winander the choral modulation: ??????????, ????, ????. ??????????, ????, ????. ??????? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????????, ??????? ???? ??????, ????, ????. ???????????? ????????. Brek-ek-ek-ex! ko-ax! ko-ax! Our lay's harmonious burthen be: In vain yon critic owl attacks Our blithe and full-voiced minstrelsy. Still shall our lips the strain prolong With strength of lung that never slacks; Still wake the wild and wondrous song: Ko-ax! ko-ax! ko-ax! ko-ax! Chorus in the Frogs of Aristophanes. vent— “Pray who can ride like me? “For I'm the man, who sallied forth To rout the classic forces, And swore this mare was far more worth Than both fierce Hector's horses. “Old Homer from his throne I struck, To Virgil gave a punch, And in the place of both I stuck The doughty Mother Bunch. “To France I galloped on my roan, Whose mettle nought can quail; There squatted on the tomb of Joan, And piped a dismal tale. “A wild and wondrous stave I sung, To make my hearers weep: But when I looked, and held my tongue, I found them fast asleep! ? ????? ?(???? ?????????, ????????? ?????, ?? ??? ??? ????????? ?? ?????? ??? “Oh! then, a furious oath I swore, Some dire revenge to seek; And conjured up, to make them roar, Stout Taffy and his leek. “To Heaven and Hell I rode away, In spite of wind and weather: Trumped up a diabolic lay; And cursed them all together. “Now, Proteus! rise, thou changeful seer!

Let me the many-changing Proteus see, To aid my many-changing melody. It is not at all surprising, that a man, under a process of moral and political metamorphosis, should desire the patronage of this multiform god, who may be regarded as the tutelary saint of the numerous and thriving sect of Anythingarians. Perhaps the passage would have been more applicable to himself, though less so to his poem, if he had read, suo periculo: ??????? ??? ?????? ??????????, ???? ??????. ???????? ????? ????, ??? ?????? ???????? ????? Before my eyes let changeful Proteus float, When now I change my many-coloured coat. In every shape but those appear, Which Taste and Nature wear.” II. [JOHNNY IN THE SEA] DIVERSE LINGUE, ORRIBILI FAVELLE Even while he sung Sir Proteus rose, That wight of ancient fun, With salmon-scales instead of clothes, And fifty shapes in one. He first appeared a folio thick, A glossary so stout, Of modern language politic, This language was not much known to our ancestors; but it is now pretty well understood by the majority of the H?of C?, by the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly venders of panegyric and defamation, and by the quondam republicans of the Northern Lakes. The echoes of Grasmere and Derwentwater have responded to its melodious vocables. The borderers of Tweed and Teviot, and the “Braw, braw lads of Edinbroo’,” are well versed in its tangible eloquence. Specimens of its use in composition may be seen in the Courier newspaper, in the Quarterly Review, in the Edinburgh Annual Register, and in the receipts of the stamp-commissioners for the county of Westmoreland. Where conscience was left out. He next appeared in civic guise, Which C?s could not flout, C?s: This is a learned man, “who does not want instruction:” an independent man, “who always votes according to his conscience,” which has a singular habit of finding the minister invariably right: a free man, who always “takes the liberty” to do that which is most profitable to himself: a man, in short, of the first magnitude, that “don't care nothing for nobody” whom he cannot turn a penny by: Rarum ac memorabile magni Gutturis exemplum, conducendusque magister: who will be inexhaustible food for laughter while he lives; and, though not witty himself, be the cause of wit in others: and who, when he shall have been found, cum capite in lasano, dead of a surfeit after a civic feast, shall be entombed in some mighty culinary utensil, vast as the patina of Vitellius, or the fish-kettle of Domitian, which shall be erected in the centre of the salle des gourmands, with this Homeric inscription, to transmit his virtues to posterity: ????????? ? ??????? ? ?????? ? ?????? ? ??????? ? ??? ? ?????? ? ???? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ???? ? ??? ? ????? ? ?? ? ???? ? ????? ? ?? ? ????????. Great was his skill, insatiably to dine On pounds of flesh and copious floods of wine: No mental strength his heavy form inspired, But hooting crowds the portly mass admired. With forced-meat balls instead of eyes, And, for a nose, a snout. And then he seemed a patriot braw, Who, o'er a pot of froth, Was very busy, stewing straw, To make the people broth. In robes collegiate, loosely spread, His form he seemed to wrap: Much Johnny mused to see no head Between the gown and cap. This must have been something which had finished its education, as the saying is, at one of our learned universities. Like grave logician, next he drew A tube from garment mystic; And bubbles blew, which Johnny knew Were anti-hyloistic. There is a modern bubble-blower of this description, whose philosophical career it is agreeable to trace. First, we discover him up to his neck in fluids and crystallizations, laboring to build a geological system, in all respects conformable to the very scientific narrative of that most enlightened astronomer and profound cosmogonist, Moses. Emerging from his “primitive ocean,” he soars into the opaque atmosphere of scholastic dialectics, whence he comes forth the doughty champion of that egregious engine of the difficiles nugæ and labor ineptiarum, syllogism. Armed with this formidable weapon, he rushes into the metaphysical arena, in the consistent character of a dogmatising antihyloist, insanire parans certa ratione modoque: maintaining the existence of three distinct substances, that of God, that of angels, and that of the souls of men, and annihilating in toto the sun, moon, and stars, and all “the visible diurnal sphere;” denying the evidence of his senses, and asserting the reality of chimæras. Man, according to him, is a being spiritual, intelligent, and immortal, while all other animals are insentient machines; a proposition which must be amply established in the mind of every one, who will take the trouble of comparing a man-milliner with a lion, an alderman with an elephant, or a Bond-street lounger with a Newfoundland dog.—See the Geological, Logical, and Metaphysical Essays of Richard Kirwan, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., P.R.I.A., &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Metaphysical science, in the hands of a Locke, a Berkeley, an Hume, or a Drummond, demands and receives my utmost respect and admiration; but I must confess there are moments, when, after having fatigued my understanding with the lucubrations of such a systematical déraisonneur as this, I am tempted to exclaim with Anacreon: ?? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????,. ??? ??????? ???????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ????????, ??? ????? ??????????? Why tease me with pedantic themes, Predicaments and enthymemes, My mental storehouse vainly stowing With heaps of knowledge not worth knowing? The third part of the Metaphysical Essays will afford a delectable treat to the observer of phænomena, who may be desirous of contemplating a meteorosophistical spider completely entangled in his own cobweb; and I can scarcely help thinking it was to some such paradoxographical philosophaster that Virgil alluded, when he said: Invisa Minervæ Laxos in foribus suspendit aranea casses. The subtle spider, sage Minerva's hate, Hangs his loose webs in wisdom's temple-gate. It is much to be lamented, that, before Sir Proteus quitted his metaphysical shape, it did not occur to our hero to propound to him the celebrated philosophical question: Utrum, Protée omniforme se faisant cigale, et musicalement exerçant sa voix és jours caniculaires, pourroit, d'une rosée matutine soigneusement emballée au mois de Mai, faire une tierce concoction, devant le cours entier d'une escharpe zodiacale?—Perhaps Mr. Kirwan himself will undertake the solution: I know no man so well qualified. Like doughty critic next he sped, Of fragrant Edinbroo': A yellow cap was on his head; His jacket was sky-blue: He wore a cauliflower wig, With bubble filled, and squeak; Where hung behind, like tail of pig, Small lollypop of Greek. “Small skill in Latin, and still less in Greek, Is more than adequate to all we seek!” Cowper. With rusty knife he seemed prepared Poor poet's blood to fetch: In speechless horror Johnny stared Upon the ruthless wretch. The severity of this blue-jacketed gentleman has been productive, on many occasions, of very salutary effects. He is much more reprehensible for having condescended to play the part of Justice Midas to Mr. Wordsworth, Mrs. Opie, Mr. Wilson, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., while superior claimants have been treated with harshness or contempt. If praise be withheld from Moore, comparative justice requires that it should not be given to Bloomfield. The philosophical enemy of idolatry may tear the laurel wreath from the brow of Apollo; but he must not transfer it to the statue of Pan. Like washing-tub he next appeared O'er W?'s sea Mare Australe Incognitum. For a satisfactory account of this undiscovered sea, consult the Lyrical Ballads of William Wordsworth, Esq. that scuds; Where poor John Bull stood all besmeared, Up to the neck in suds. John Bull is here alluded to in his domestic capacity. He is a sturdy wight, but the arch-fiend Corruption has proved too strong for him. Let not the temporary elation of triumph over his most inveterate foreign foe blind him to the insidious inroads of that more formidable enemy, which has already plunged him so deep in the alkaline ebullitions mentioned in the text. Among the causes which have contributed to his submersion may be enumerated the selfish and mercenary apostacy of his quondam literary champions. Where is now “the eye that sees, the heart That feels, the voice that in these evil times, Amid these evil tongues, exalts itself, And cries aloud against iniquity?” Let the Edinburgh Annual Register answer the question. Where are “the skirts of the departing year?” Waving, like those of a Courier's jacket, in the withering gales of ministerial influence.—The antique enemies of “the monster Pitt” are now the panegyrists of the immaculate Castlereagh. The spell which Armida breathed over her captives was not more magically mighty in the operation of change, than are the golden precepts of the language politic, when presented in a compendious and tangible shape to the “sons of little men.” Terra malos homines nunc educat atque pusillos; Ergo Deus, quicumque adspexit, ridet et odit. Then three wise men he seemed to be, Still sailing in the tub; Whose white wigs looked upon the sea, Like bowl of syllabub. These three wiseacres go to sea in their tub, as their prototypes of Gotham did in their bowl, not to fish for the moon, but to write nonsense about her. The first he chattered, chattered still, With meaning none at all, Of Jack and Jill, and Harry Gill, And Alice Fell so small. Who knows not Alice Fell? the little orphan Alice Fell? with her cloak of duffel grey? and Harry Gill, whose teeth they chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter still? and Jack and Jill, that climbed the hill, to fetch a pail of water; when Jack fell down, and cracked his crown, and Jill came tumbling after? The second of three graves did sing, And in such doggrel strains, You might have deemed the Elfin King Had charmed away his brains. Surely this cannot allude to Mr. ?????? Coleridge, the profound transcendental metaphysician of the Friend, the consistent panegyrical politician of the Courier, the self-elected laureate of the asinine king, the compounder of the divinest narcotic under the shape of a tragedy that ever drugged the beaux of Drury-Lane, the author of that irresistibly comic ballad, the Ancient Mariner, and of a very exquisite piece of tragical mirth, also in the form of a ballad, entitled the Three Graves, which read—“if you can!” Loud sang the third of Palmy Isle, Mid oceans vast and wild, Where he had won a mermaid's smile, And got a fairy child. The adventures of this worthy are narrated in a rhapsodical congeries of limping verse, entitled the Isle of Palms, very loftily extolled by the Edinburgh Reviewers, and very peremptorily condemned by the tribunal of common sense. The whining cant and drivelling affectation of this author, with his “dear God,” his “blessed creatures,” and his “happy living things,” which would be insufferable in a spinster half-dying with megrim, become trebly disgusting in the mouth of a man, who has no such fine sympathies with the animal creation, and is not only an indefatigable angler, but a cock-fighter of the first notoriety. It is a curious fact, that as he was one day going to a match, accompanied by a man who carried two bags of fighting-cocks, he unexpectedly met his friend Wordsworth (who was coming to visit him), and immediately caused the man to secrete himself and the cocks behind the hedge; an anecdote which redounds greatly to the credit of Mr. Wordsworth's better feelings, and makes me strongly inclined to forgive him his Idiot Boy, and the Moods of his own mind, and even Harry Gill. Like rueful wanderer next he shewed, Much posed with pious qualm; And first he roared a frantic ode, And then he sung a psalm. Wanderer! whither dost thou roam? Weary wanderer, old and grey! Wherefore hast thou left thy home, In the twilight of thy day? Montgomery's Wanderer of Switzerland. The twilight of this wanderer's day is a dim morning twilight, on which no sun will rise. The day-beams of genius are quenched in the mists of fanaticism. Like farmer's man, he seemed to rear His form in smock-frock dight; And screeched in poor Apollo's ear, Who ran with all his might. And, even while Apollo ran, Arose the Bellman there, And clapped the crack-voiced farmer's man Into his vacant chair. In medio duo signa, Conon . . . . et quis fuit alter? Conon was a farmer's boy, a minstrel of cows and cow-sheds, and cow-dung, and cow-pock; yet nevertheless a considerable favourite with the delicate and fashionable fair-ones of his day: et quis fuit alter? scil. the bellman: the bellman, ???? ??????. He was a character very ridiculously remarkable in the annals of rural perfumery, who most ludicrously mistook himself for a poet and philosopher, passed much of his time in star-gazing, wrote some dismal jargon which he christened Sonnets on the Petrarchan Model, kept a journal of the rain and wind, and rang many a peal of nonsense in praise of his friend Conon, the farmer's boy, who was indeed tali dignus amico. Discedo Alcæus puncto illius: ille meo quis? Quis, nisi Callimachus? Next, like Tom Thumb, he skipped along In merry Irish jig: And now he whined an amorous song, And now he pulled a wig, Note, by Professor Nodus-in-Scirpo, of the University of Cambridge.—It is well known that a certain little poet challenged a certain great critic to the deadly arbitrament of powder and wadding. Of this circumstance the multiform Proteus here seems to make himself symbolical. The wig seems to typify the body corporate of criticism, which, being roughly handled in one of its side-curls, opens fire from all its frizzles on the daring assailant in a volley of Indian crackers, the different colours of which are composed of the party-colours supposed to be worn by the respective corps of critics militant. Whose frizzles, firing at his rage, Like Indian crackers flew, Each wrapped in party-coloured page Of some profound review. Of Reviews in the present day we have satis superque. We have the Edinburgh Review, already eulogised; and the Monthly Review, which I believe is tolerably impartial, though not very remarkable either for learning or philosophy; and the Quarterly Review, a distinguished vehicle of compositions in the language politic; and the British Critic, which proceeds on the enlightened principle that nothing can possibly be good coming from an heretic or a republican; and the Antijacobin Review, . . . .; and the British Review, of which I can say nothing, never having read a single page of it; and the Eclectic Review, an exquisite focus of evangelical illumination; and the New Review, which promises to be an useful Notitia Literaria; and the Critical Review, which I am very reluctant to mention at all, as I can only dismiss it in the words of Captain Bobadil:—“It is to gentlemen I speak: I talk to no scavenger.” In jaunting car, A wooden car, perpetuo revolubile gyro, may rumble through Ireland, Scotland, France, and the Netherlands, and annoy the ears of the English metropolis with the heavy echo of its wheels; but it must not pretend to be the vehicle of poetic inspiration, unless the inutile lignum be mechanically impelled to the proclamation of its own emptiness. To illustrate this proposition by a case in point. A minute inspection of the varieties of human absurdity brings us acquainted with the existence of a certain knight, who has travelled rapidly, profited sparingly, and published enormously. Sublimed into extraordinary daring by the garlands of dwarf-laurel, torn from the bogs of the Shannon and the shores of the Caledonian lakes, he has actually made a profane excursion on the boundaries of Parnassus, and presented the public with a curious collection of weeds, under the facetious title of Poems, by Sir John Carr! Amongst these is one on a paper-mill. The knight has been so good a friend to the paper-mill, that had his benefactions stopped with his custom, he would have merited the eternal gratitude of all that band of mechanics, who begin, what other mechanics like himself conclude, the process of making a book. But his bounty does not stop so short. Not satisfied with having raised the price of rags and the wages of the paper-millers, he has actually favoured the world with a poem on the subject, written, as he says, en badinage. We ought to be much obliged to him for the information, as it shews, by contradistinction, that some of his works have been written in sober sadness; though I believe the greater part of those indefatigable devourers of new publications, who, by the aid of snuff and coffee, have contrived to keep themselves awake over his lucubrations, have imagined all his works to have been designed for badinage, from the burlesque solemnity and grave no-meaning of his statistical, political, and topographical discussions, to the very tragical merriment of his retailed puns and right pleasant original conceits. But here is a poem written professedly en badinage. Therefore badinons un peu with the worthy cavaliere errante. “LINES Written en badinage, after visiting a paper-mill near Tunbridge Wells, in consequence of the lovely Miss W., who excels in drawing, requesting the author to describe the process of making paper in verse.” I should imagine, from the young lady's requesting Sir John to employ his grey quill on a paper-mill, that the lovely Miss W. excels in quizzing as much as she does in drawing. “Reader! I do not wish to brag, But, to display Eliza's skill, I'd proudly be the vilest rag, That ever went to paper-mill.” Or that ever came from it, Sir John might have added. “Content in pieces to be cut”— Sir John has been cut up so often, that he must be well used to the operation: it is satisfactory to find him so well pleased with it. Nature indeed seems to have formed him for the express purpose of being cut in pieces. He is a true literary polypus, and multiplies under the knife of dissection. “Content in pieces to be cut, Though sultry were the summer skies, Pleased between flannel I'd be put, And after bathed in jellied size.” “Though to be squeezed and hanged I hate”— This line lets us into an extraordinary piece of taste on the part of the Knight. He does not like to be hanged. Non porrigit ora capistro. “For thee, sweet girl, upon my word”— Vivide et ???????. “When the stout press had forced me flat”— “The stout press:”—Stout, indeed, when even Sir John's quartos have not broken it down.—“Had forced me flat:”—Sir John, we see, is of opinion that great force would be requisite to make him flat. For my part, I think that he is quite flat enough already, and that he has rather communicated his own flatness to the press, than derived that quality from it. “I'd be suspended on a cord.” This is gallantry indeed: for the sake of the lovely Miss W. Sir John would even suffer the suspension of his outward man, notwithstanding his singular antipathy to the process. “And then when dried”— Cut first, sir, and dried after, like one of his own cut and dried anecdotes, introduced so very apropos, as “a curious circumstance that happened to me.” —“and fit for use”— By dint of cutting up and hanging Sir John is made useful. Presently he will be ornamental. “Eliza! I would pray to thee”— We see Sir John does not think of praying till after he has been hanged, contrary to the usual process on similar occasions. “If with thy pen thou wouldest amuse, That thou wouldest deign to write on me.” Nay, nay, Sir John, not on you. “Verse must be dull on subjects so d?d dry.” “Gad's bud!”— A classical exclamation, equivalent to the medius-fidius of Petronius, the Ædepol of Terence, and the ?? ??? ??????? of Aristophanes. “Gad's bud! how pleasant it would prove Her pretty chit-chat to convey:” The world is well aware of Sir John's talent for conveying the pretty chit-chat of his acquaintance into his dapper quartos; but how pleasant the operation has proved to any one but himself, I am not prepared to decide. “P'rhaps—” An Attic contraction. “P'rhaps be the record of her love, Told in some coy enchanting way.” If this should ever be the case, I can furnish the young lady with a suitable exordium from an old Italian poet: Scrivend' io già mio forsennato amore Su duro foglio d' asinina pelle. “Or if her pencil she would try On me, oh may she still imprint Those forms that fix the admiring eye, Each graceful line, each glowing tint.” I know not what success the lovely Miss W. might have in making Sir John ornamental. Gillray, we all know, tried his pencil on him very successfully, and fixed a glowing tint (of anger, not of shame) on the cheek of the exasperated Sir John. “Then shall I reason have to brag, For thus, to high importance grown, The world will see a simple rag Become a treasure rarely known.” So ends this miserable shred of what Sir John calls badinage. “Away! thou rag! thou quantity! thou remnant!” And so much for the Poems of Sir John Carr. ???? ?? ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????? ????. Let him in peace the depths of Lethe gain, Since all-wise Jove hath robbed his sconce of brain. like tourist brave, Full speed he seemed to rush; And chaunted many a clumsy stave, Might make the Bellman blush. Like grizzly monk, on spectral harp Deep dole he did betoken; And strummed one strain, 'twixt flat and sharp, Till all the strings were broken. Like modish bard, intent to please The sentimental fair, He strung conceits and similes, Where feeling had no share. Non multum abludit imago from Mr. W. R. Spenser, a writer of fantastical namby-pambies and epigrammatico-sentimental madrigals, on the clasp of a waist or the tie of a garter, on the ancle of Lady H?k, or the bosom of Lady J?y, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Mr. S. trespasses so often on forbidden ground, that the reader begins to anticipate strange things, and is almost ready to exclaim, Quos agor in specus? The fashionable world has its own luminaries of taste and genius. Solem suum sua sidera norunt. But they have more of the meteor than the star, and even of the meteor more of its transience than its lustre. The little lustre they possess is indeed meteoric, for it shines within a narrow circle, and only a feeble report of its existence passes the limits of its sphere. Ad nos vix tenuis famæ perlabitur aura. The solitary philosopher reads in some critical ephemeris that such a meteor has been observed: he notices the subject for a moment, and returns to the contemplation of those stars, which have shone and will continue to shine for ages. There are no results of human art, in which the fluxum atque caducum is so strikingly exemplified as in those productions which constitute what may be denominated fashionable literature. This is one of the affairs of men in which there is no tide. There is no refluence in fashionable taste. It is an everflowing stream, which rolls on its inexhaustible store of new poems, new romances, new biography, new criticism, new morality, —to that oblivious gulph, from which a very few are redeemed by the swans of renown. The few so redeemed cease to be fashionable, and to the really literary part of mankind they scarcely begin to be known, when to the soi-disant literati of the fashionable world they are already numbered with the things that were; with Dryden, and Drayton, and Spenser, and other obsolete worthies; of every one of whom the fashionable reader may exclaim: Notus mihi nomine tantum! and who have been rudely thrust aside to make way for these new-comers, as the choicest productions of Greek and Roman taste were trampled into the dust on the irruption of the Goths and Vandals, or as the statues of Apollo, Venus, and the Graces were thrown down and demolished by the more barbarous fanatics of the dark ages, in order that St. Benedict, and St. Dominic, and St. Anthropophagos might be placed upon their pedestals. The great desideratum in fashionable literature is novelty. The last publications which have issued from the press in the department of the belles lettres must cooperate with the last princely fête, the last elegant affair of crim. con., the last semivir imported from Italy, in filling up that portion of fashionable conversation, which is not engrossed by pure no-meaning, by party, or by scandal. These publications are caught up wet from the press, and thrown carelessly on the table, the sofa, or the ottoman, to furnish a ready answer to the certain questions of the lounging visitor: Is this Mr. S.'s new poem? Have you seen Mr. L.'s romance? Have you met with Miss M.'s puritanical novel? Have you fallen asleep, as I did, over the last Battle? till some newer effusion of fancy dispossess them of their post of honor, and send them to a private station on the shelves of the library, to sleep with those that have been mighty in their day, with the Tales of Wonder and the Botanic Garden, with the flowery Wreath of Della Crusca and the barren Landscape of Knight, with the Travels of Sir John Carr, the Biography of Mr. Shepherd, and the Criticism of Dr. Drake. This undistinguishing passion for literary novelty seems to involve nothing less than a total extinction of every thing like discrimination in taste and nature in imagination: and it would be rendering no slight service to the cause of sound criticism and philosophical literature, to hold up Banquo's mirror to the readers of the fashionable world, and shew them, at one view, the phantoms of those productions which they have successively admired and forgotten, from the days of love-sick marygolds and sentimental daffydowndillies, to these of pathetic ruffians, poetical bandits, and “maids that love the moon.” If, in the execution of this office, it should sometimes be necessary to perform the part of a resurrection-man in criticism, and compel the canonized form of many a would-be poet and pilferer of old romances to burst the cerements of his literary sepulchre, the operation would not be wholly without its use. The audible memento which these spectres would thunder in the ears of the indefatigable scribblers of the day would operate in terrorem on the side of common sense, and by stifling in its birth many a crude embryo of nonsense, save many a groan to the press, many a head-ache to the critic, and much perversion of intellect to the rising generation. Praise, when well deserved, should be freely given: but in cases so desperate as the present, the severity of justice should not be tempered by the least degree of unmerited mercy.—Common sense and taste can scarcely stem the torrent of doggrel and buffoonery, which is daily poured forth by the press, “Even as Fleet Ditch, with disemboguing streams, “Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames.” The gardens of Parnassus are over-run with weeds, which have been suffered to fatten in obscurity by the mistaken lenity of contempt. To bruise their heads is useless: they must be torn up by the roots before any wholesome plant can have room to flourish in the soil.—If we desire that Philosophy may re-enter the temple of Apollo, we must not hesitate to throw down the Corycian Cave the rubbish that defiles its courts and chokes its vestibule. I would apply to subjects of taste the severe morality of Sophocles: ???? ?? ????? ????? ????? ???? ????? ?????, ????? ???? ???????? ?? ??? ????? ????? ???????? ? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ?? ?? ????. At last, in cap with border red, A Minstrel seemed to stand, With heather bell upon his head, And fiddle in his hand; And such a shrill and piercing scrape Of hideous discord gave, That none but Johnny's ear could scape Unfractured by the stave. Old Poulter's mare, in sudden fright, Forgot all John had taught her; And up she reared, a furious height, And soused him in the water. III. [JOHNNY UNDER THE SEA] OR CHI SEI TU? Ten thousand thousand fathoms down Beneath the sea he popped: At last a coral cracked his crown, And Johnny Raw was stopped. “Ten thousand thousand fathoms down he dropped; Till in an ice-rift, 'mid the eternal snow, Foul Arvalan is stopped.” Southey's Curse of Kehama. Sir Proteus came, and picked him up, With grim and ghastly smile; And asked him to walk in and sup, And fiddled all the while. Sir Proteus, having fixed himself in the shape most peculiarly remote from taste and nature, that of a minstrel of the Scottish border, continues to act up to the full spirit of the character he has assumed, by fiddling with indefatigable pertinacity to the fall of the curtain. So up he got, and felt his head, And feared his brain was diddled; While still the ocean o'er him spread, And still Sir Proteus fiddled. And much surprised he was to be Beneath the ocean's root; For a particular description of the roots of the ocean, see Mr. Southey's Thalaba. Which then he found was one great tree, Where grew odd fish for fruit. And there were fish both young and old, And fish both great and small; And some of them had heads of gold, And some no heads at all. And now they came, where Neptune sate, With beard like any Jew, With all his Tritons round in state, And all his Nereids too: And when poor Johnny's bleeding sconce The moody king did view, “Up starts the moody Elfin King,” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Lady of the Lake. He stoutly bellowed, all at once: “Pray who the deuce are you? “That thus dare stalk, and walk, and talk, Beneath my tree, the sea, sir, And break your head on coral bed, Without the leave of me, sir?” IV. [CHEVY CHASE] ?????? ?? ???????? ??????. Poor Johnny looked exceeding blue, Though in blue ocean seen, Blue, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue, In all its rich variety of tints, Suffused with glowing gold. Southey's Madoc. As blue as Neptune's self; And cursed the jade, his skull that threw Upon the coral shelf; And thrice he cursed the jarring strain, That scraping Proteus sung, Which forced his mare to rear amain, And got her rider flung. His clashing thoughts, that flocked so quick, He strove in vain to clear; For still the ruthless fiddlestick Was shrieking at his ear, A piercing modulated shriek, “A long, shrill, piercing, modulated cry.” Southey's Madoc. So comically sad, That oft he strove in vain to speak, He felt so wondrous mad. But seeing well, by Neptune's phiz, He deemed the case no joke, In spite of all the diz and whiz, Like parish-clerk he spoke This would be no ill compliment to the author last cited, a professed admirer and imitator of Sternhold and Hopkins. A wondrous speech, and all in rhyme, As long as Chevy Chase, Which made Sir Proteus raise his chime, While Glaucus fled the place. He sung of men, who nature's law So little did redoubt, They flourished when the life was raw, And when the brain was out; There is a gentleman in this condition in Mr. Southey's Curse of Kehama, who is nevertheless perfectly alive and vigorous, makes two or three attempts to ravish a young lady, and is invariably repelled by a very severe fustigation. The times have been, that when the brain was out the man would die; but, with so many living contradictions of this proposition, we can scarcely rank the dead-alive Arvalan among the most monstrous fictions of Hindoo mythology; whatever we may think of the spinning-wheel arms of Kehama, who contrives to split himself into eight pieces, for the convenience of beating eight devils at once: for which profane amusement he is turned to a red-hot coal. Voilà la belle imagination! Whose arms were iron spinning-wheels, That twirled when winds did puff, And forced Old Scratch to ply his heels, By dint of usage rough. Grim Neptune bade him stop the peals Of such infernal stuff. But when once in, no art could win To silence Johnny Raw: For Nereid's grin, or Triton's fin, He did not care a straw; So still did spin his rhyming din, Without one hum or haw, Though still the crazy violin Kept screaming: “Hoot awa'!” Till all the Tritons gave a yell, And fled, in rout inglorious, With all the Nereids, from the spell Of Johnny's stave laborious, And Neptune scouted in his shell, And left stout Raw victorious. V. [THE BATHOS] ASPRO CONCENTO, ORRIBILE ARMONIA But Proteus feared not Johnny's tongue, And vowed to be the master; And still the louder Johnny sung, Bold Proteus scraped the faster; And raised a rhyme of feudal time, A song of moonlight foray, Of bandits bold in days of old, The Scott, the Kerr, the Murray. Who, by their good King James desired To keep up rule and order, Like trusty guardians, robbed, and fired, And ravaged, all the border. Then sung he of an English Peer, “The good Lord Marmion, by my life!” A champion bold and brawny, Who loved good cheer, and killed his dear, And threshed presumptuous Sawney. Then Roderick, starch in battle's brunt, The changing theme supplied; And Maid, that paddled in a punt Across Loch Katrine's tide: And horse, and hound, and bugle's sound, Inspired the lively lay, With ho! ieroe! and tallyho! And yoicks! and harkaway! Then much he raved of lunar light, Like human conscience changing; Sir Proteus appears to borrow this part of his many-changing melody from the exordium of Mr. Scott's Rokeby, which is in manner and form following: The moon is in her summer glow; But hoarse and high the breezes blow, And, racking o'er her face, the cloud Varies the tincture of her shroud. On Barnard's towers, and Tees's stream, She changes like a guilty dream, When Conscience with remorse and fear Goads sleeping Fancy's wild career. Her light seemed now the blush of shame, Seemed now fierce anger's darker flame, Shifting that shade to come and go, Like apprehension's hurried glow; Then sorrow's livery dims the air, And dies in darkness, like despair. Such varied hues the warder sees Reflected from the woodland Tees. It would not be easy to find a minstrel strain more opposite, in every respect, to taste and nature than this. What is the summer glow of the moon? Glow is heat or the appearance of heat. But there is no heat in the moon's rays, nor do I believe that the face of that planet ever presented such an appearance. The cloud, which racks over the face of the moon, and varies the tincture of her shroud, is a very incomprehensible cloud indeed. By rack I presume Mr. Scott to understand the course of the clouds when in motion. This, Mr. Tooke has shewn, is not the true meaning of the word. Rack is merely that which is reeked: a vapour, a steam, an exhalation. It is the past participle of the Anglo-saxon verb, pecan, exhalare: but to talk of a cloud reeking or steaming over the face of the moon would be downright nonsense. But whether rack signify motion or vapour, what is the shroud of the moon, of which the cloud varies the tincture? It cannot be the cloud itself, for in that case the cloud would be said to vary its own tincture. It plainly implies something external to the moon and different from the cloud, and what is that something? Most assuredly nothing that ever came within the scope of meteorological observation. The moon, thus clouded and shrouded, reflects on her disk various mental phænomena, which are seen by the warder. Now it is most probable, that the warders of past days, like the centinels of the present, were in the habit of looking at nature with the eyes of vulgar mortals, and not of remarking mental phænomena in the disk of the moon. Had the poor little pitiful whining Wilfrid discovered these chimæras, it would at least have been more in character. The dark-red appearance, which would characterise the flame of anger and the glow of apprehension,the moon never assumes but when very near the horizon, and in that position her tincture does not vary. “Shifting a shade to come and go” will scarcely pass for good English on this side of the Tweed. The livery of sorrow, if it mean any thing, must mean a mourning coat, and what idea is conveyed to the mind, by the figure of a black livery dying in darkness? And damsel bright, at dead of night, With bold Hibernian ranging; And buccaneer, so stern and staunch, Who, though historians vary, Did wondrous feats on tough buck's haunch, And butt of old Canary. The fiddle, with a gong-like power, Still louder, louder swelling, Resounded till it shook the bower, Grim Neptune's coral dwelling: And still Sir Proteus held his course, To prove his muse no craven, Until he grew completely hoarse, And croaked like any raven. They might have thought, who heard the strum Of such unusual strain, That Discord's very self was come, With all her minstrel train, Headlong by vengeful Phœbus thrown, Through ocean's breast to sweep, To where Sir Bathos sits alone, Majestic on his wire-wove throne, Below the lowest deep. ???? ????, ??? ???????? ??? ?????? ???? ????????, ?????? ?????? ?????, ???? ??????? ???? ??? ?????. VI. [THE WORLD'S END] COLÀ DOVE È IL FINIMONDO Though Johnny prized the Jew's-harp twang Beyond old Homer's harp, Our hero is not singular. The harp of Israel is exalted above the lyre of Greece by the poetical orthodoxy of the bards of the lakes: Mæonium qui jam soliti contemnere carmen, Judaicos discunt numeros, servantque, coluntque, Tradidit arcano quoscumque volumine Moses! which accounts for the air of conscious superiority and dignified contempt they assume towards those perverted disciples of Homer and Sophocles, who are insensible to the primitive mellifluence of patriarchal modulation. It is not less creditable to the soundness of their theology than to the purity of their taste, that they herein differ toto cælo from the profane Frenchman, who concludes his poem with a treaty between the principal personages of the ancient and modern religions of Europe, by which it is stipulated, that the latter shall continue throned in glory on Mount Sinai, while the former shall retain the exclusive and undisturbed possession of Mount Parnassus. He little loved the barbarous clang Of fiddle cracked and sharp: And when the names Sir Proteus said Of Murray, Kerr, and Scott; The sound went crashing through his head, Like Van Tromp's famous shot, This shot, I am informed, is still to be seen at Sheerness. Which, like some adamantine rock, By Hector thrown in sport, Plumped headlong into Sheerness dock, And battered down a fort. Like one astound, John stared around, And watched his time to fly; And quickly spied, amid the tide, A dolphin sailing by;— And jumped upon him in a crack, And touched him in the fin, And rose triumphant, on his back, Through ocean's roaring din: While Proteus, on his fiddle bent, Still scraped his feudal jig; Nor marked, as on his ballad went, His bird had hopped the twig. So Johnny rose mid ocean's roar, And landed was full soon, Upon a wild and lonely shore, Beneath the waning moon. He sate him down, beside a cave As black as hell itself, And heard the breakers roar and rave, A melancholy elf: But when he wanted to proceed, And advertise his mare, In vain he struggled to be freed, Such magic fixed him there. Then came a voice of thrilling force: “In vain my power you brave, For here must end your earthly course, And here's Oblivion's cave. “Far, far within its deep recess, Descends the winding road, By which forgotten minstrels press To Pluto's drear abode. “Here Cr?k?r fights his battles o'er, And doubly kills the slain, Where Y? no more can nod or snore In concert to the strain. “Here to psalm tunes thy C?l?r?dge sets His serio-comic lay: Here his grey Pegasus curvets, Where none can hear him bray. “Here dreaming W?rds?th wanders lost, Since Jove hath cleft his deck: ? ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ???? ????? ???????, ???? ??? ?????? ?????.

THE ROUND TABLE; OR, KING ARTHUR'S FEAST. INTRODUCTION King Arthur is said to have disappeared after the battle of Camlan, and to have never been seen again; which gave rise to a tradition, that he had been carried away by Merlin, a famous prophet and magician of his time, and would return to his kingdom at some future period.—The Welch continued to expect him for many hundred years; and it is by no means certain that they have entirely given him up. He is here represented as inhabiting a solitary island, under the influence of the prophet Merlin; by whose magic power he is shown all the kings and queens who have sat on his throne since his death, and giving to them a grand feast, at his old established round table, attended by their principal secretaries, dukes, lords, admirals, generals, poets, and a long train of courtiers. The kings are of course mentioned in the order of succession. The allegory is illustrated as concisely as possible in the notes. So many histories of England being published for the use of young persons, we have only attached the names of the kings, and to such instances as might not be considered sufficiently explanatory. King Arthur sat down by the lonely sea-coast, As thin as a lath, and as pale as a ghost: He looked on the east, and the west, and the south, With a tear in his eye, and a pipe in his mouth; And he said to old Merlin, who near him did stand, Drawing circles, triangles, and squares on the sand, “Sure nothing more dismal and tedious can be, Than to sit always smoking and watching the sea: Say when shall the fates re-establish my reign, And spread my round-table in Britain again?” Old Merlin replied: “By my art it appears, Not in less than three hundred and seventy years; But in the mean time I am very well able To spread in this island your ancient round table; And to grace it with guests of unparallelled splendour, I'll summon old Pluto forthwith to surrender All the kings who have sat on your throne, from the day When from Camlan's destruction I snatched you away.” King Arthur's long face, by these accents restored, Grew as round as his table, as bright as his sword; While the wand of old Merlin waved over the ocean, Soon covered its billows with brilliant commotion; For ships of all ages and sizes appearing, Towards the same shore were all rapidly steering, Came cleaving the billows with sail and with oar, Yacht, pinnace, sloop, frigate, and seventy-four. King Arthur scarce spied them afar from the land, Ere their keels were fixed deep in the yellow seasand; And from under their canopies, golden and gay, Came kings, queens, and courtiers, in gallant array, Much musing and marvelling who it might be, That was smoking his pipe by the side of the sea; But Merlin stepped forth with a greeting right warm, And then introduced them in order and form. The Saxons The Saxons invaded England, and dispossessed the Britons. The most famous of the Saxon kings was Alfred. came first, the pre-eminence claiming, With scarce one among them but Alfred worth naming. Full slily they looked upon Canute The Danes, under Canute, conquered the Saxons. The sons of Canute died without children, and the government returned to the Saxon kings. the bold, And remembered the drubbing he gave them of old: Sad Harold The last of the Saxon kings was Harold II., who was killed in the battle of Hastings, when William, Duke of Normandy, gained a decisive victory. came last; and the crown which he wore Had been broken, and trampled in dust and in gore. Now the sun in the west had gone down to repose, When before them at once a pavilion arose; Where Arthur's round table was royally spread, And illumined with lamps, purple, yellow, and red. The smell of roast beef put them all in a foment, So they scrambled for seats, and were ranged in a moment. The Conqueror William I. the Conqueror. stood up, as they thought, to say grace; But he scowled round the board with a resolute face; And the company stared, when he swore by the fates, That a list he would have of their names and estates; Doomsday Book. And lest too much liquor their brains should inspire To set the pavilion and table on fire, He hoped they'd acknowledge he counselled right well, To put out the lights when he tinkled his bell. The curfew. His speech was cut short by a general dismay; For William the Second William II. Rufus. had fainted away, At the smell of some New Forest Venison Accidentally killed by an arrow while hunting in the New Forest. before him; But a tweak of the nose, Arthur said, would restore him. But another disturbance compelled him to mark The pitiful state of poor Henry Beauclerk; Henry I. Beauclerk. Who had fallen on the lampreys with ardour so stout, Died eating lampreys. That he dropped from his chair in the midst of the rout. Old Arthur, surprised at a king so voracious, Thought a salt-water ducking might prove efficacious. Now Stephen, Stephen, of Bloix. for whom some bold barons had carved, Held in subjection by the barons. Said, while some could get surfeited, he was half-starved: For his arms were so pinioned, unfortunate elf! And so restricted in his authority, that he had little more than the name of a king. He could hit on no method of helping himself. But a tumult more furious called Arthur to check it, 'Twixt Henry the Second Henry II. Fitz-Empress. and Thomas-a-Becket. Quarrelled with his minister, Thomas-a-Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was compelled to fly the country; but afterwards returning, was murdered by some followers of the king; for which Henry was forced to do penance, and was whipped by the monks at Becket's tomb. “Turn out,” exclaimed Arthur, “that prelate so free, And from the first rock see him thrown in the sea.” So they hustled out Becket without judge or jury, Who quickly returned in a terrible fury. The lords were enraged, and the ladies affrighted; But his head was soon cracked in the fray he excited; When in rushed some monks in a great perturbation, And gave good King Henry a sound flagellation; Which so coolly he took, that the president swore, He ne'er saw such a bigoted milk-sop before. But Arthur's good humour was quickly restored, When to lion-heart Richard Richard Cœur-de-Lion. a bumper he poured Whose pilgrim's array told the tale of his toils, Half-veiling his arms and his Saracen spoils; Returned in a pilgrim's disguise through Europe from his wars in the Holy Land. As he sliced up the venison of merry Sherwood, He told a long story of bold Robin Hood, In his time lived Robin Hood, the celebrated robber of Sherwood Forest. Which gave good King Arthur such hearty delight, That he vow'd he'd make Robin a round-table knight. While Merlin to fetch Robin Hood was preparing, John Lackland King John, surnamed Lackland. was blustering, and vapouring, and swearing, And seemed quite determined the roast to be ruling; Ambitious of absolute power. But some stout fellows near him prepared him a cooling; Who seized him, and held him, nor gave him release, Till he signed them a bond for preserving the peace. Forced by his barons to sign Magna Charta. While Henry the Third, Henry III. of Winchester. dull, contemned, and forsaken, Sat stupidly silent, regaling on Bacon, A weak and foolish king, in whose reign lived Friar Bacon. The First of the Edwards Edward I. Longshanks. charmed Arthur with tales Of fighting in Palestine, Scotland, and Wales; Gained many victories. But Merlin asserted his angry regards, Recollecting how Edward had treated the Bards. Massacred the Welch Bards. The Second, Edward II. of Caernarvon. whose days in affliction had run, Murdered by his wife's knowledge in Berkeley Castle. Sat pensive and sad 'twixt his father and son. But on the Third Edward Edward III. resplendently glance The blazons of knighthood, and trophies of France; Conquered France in conjunction with his son, the Black Prince. Beside him his son in black armour appears, That yet bears the marks of the field of Poictiers. The Battle of Poictiers. From the festival's pomp, and the table's array, Pale Richard of Bourdeaux Richard II. of Bourdeaux. turned sadly away; The thought of that time his remembrance appals, When Famine scowled on him in Pomfret's dark walls. Killed in Pomfret Castle. Beside him sat Bolingbroke, Henry IV. Bolingbroke. gloomy and stern, Nor dared his dark eyes on his victim to turn; Obtained the crown by rebelling against Richard II. The wrinkles of care o'er his features were spread, And thorns lined the crown that encircled his head. Was miserable all his reign. But Harry of Monmouth Henry V. of Monmouth. some guests had brought in, Who drank so much liquor, and made such a din, Led a very dissolute life while Prince of Wales, and kept a set of drunken companions, to whom Shakspeare has given the names of Falstaff, Bardolph, &amp;c. (While Arthur full loudly his mirth did disclose At Falstaff's fat belly and Bardolph's red nose) That he turned them all out with monarchial pride, Discarded them when he came to be king. And laid the plumed cap of his revels aside, And put on the helmet, and breastplate, and shield, That did such great service on Agincourt's field. And gained great victories in France, particularly the battle of Agincourt. And now rang the tent with unusual alarms, For the white and red roses were calling to arms; The civil wars of York and Lancaster, of which respective parties the white and red roses were the emblems. Confusion and tumult established their reign, And Arthur stood up, and called silence in vain. Poor Harry the Sixth, Henry VI. of Windsor. hustled, beaten, and prest, Had his nosegay of lilies Lost the kingdom of France. soon torn from his breast; And, though Margaret, to shield him, had clasped him around, Supported by his queen, Margaret. From her arms he was shaken, and hurled to the ground; Overcome by the York party, and made a prisoner in the Tower. While Edward of York Edward IV., raised to the throne by the aid of the Earl of Warwick; who afterwards quarrelled with Edward, and endeavoured to restore Henry, but without success. flourished over his head The rose's pale blossoms, and trampled the red; Though Warwick strove vainly the ill to repair, And set fallen Henry again on his chair. The children Edward V. and his brother, the Duke of York, died while children, supposed to have been murdered in the Tower by order of their uncle Richard. of Edward stood up in the fray, But, touched by cruel Richard, Richard III., a cruel and sanguinary tyrant. they vanished away; Who, knowing none loved him, resolved all should fear him, And therefore knocked every one down who was near him. Till him in his turn Harry Richmond Conquered in the battle of Bosworth by Henry of Richmond, afterwards Henry VII. assailed, And at once, on his downfall, good order prevailed; And Richmond uplifted, to prove the strife ended, A wreath where the white and red roses were blended. Being himself of the house of Lancaster, married Elizabeth, sister of Edward V., who was of the house of York; thus uniting the two houses, and ending the civil wars. With his Jane, and his Annes, and his Catherines beside, Sat Henry the Eighth, Henry VIII. in true Ottoman pride, And quaffed off with Wolsey the goblet's red tide; But over the head of each lady so fair An axe was impending, that hung by a hair. Had six wives—one Jane, two Annes, and three Catherines, in the following order: 1. Catherine of Arragon, whom he divorced. 2. Ann Boleyn, whom he beheaded. 3. Jane Seymour, who died in giving birth to Edward VI. 4. Ann of Cleves, whom he sent back to her parents. 5. Catherine Howard, whom he beheaded. 6. Catherine Parr, who outlived him. Bold Arthur, whose fancy this king had not won, Look'd with hope and delight on young Edward Edward VI., a very promising young prince. his son; But had scarcely commended his learning and grace, Ere he found his attention called off Died in his sixteenth year. to the place Where the infamous Mary Mary. Cruel Queen Mary. Daughter of Henry the Eighth. polluted the feast, Who sat drinking blood from the skull of a priest. Burned three hundred persons for not being of her opinion in religion. But he struggled his horror and rage to repress, And sought consolation from worthy Queen Bess, Elizabeth. A wise and fortunate queen. Who had brought Drake and Raleigh her state to sustain, Her admirals, among whom were Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh, sailed round the world, settled colonies in North America, defeated the Spanish Armada, &amp;c. With American spoils and the trophies of Spain; While Shakspeare and Spenser, In her reign lived many eminent authors, particularly Shakspeare and Spenser. with song and with fable, Enchanted King Arthur and all round his table. Now the First of the James's James the First. complained of the heat, And seemed ill at ease on his ricketty seat; It proved, when examined (which made them all stare), A gunpowder barrel instead of a chair. The gunpowder plot, 5th November, 1605. The First of the Charles's Charles I. was clearing the dishes, Taking more than his share of the loaves and the fishes, Overstrained his prerogative; encroached on the liberties of the people, and on the privileges of parliament. The consequence was a civil war and the loss of his head. Not minding at all what the company said, When up started Cromwell, and sliced off his head. The commonwealth succeeded, at the head of which was Oliver Cromwell. He was succeeded by his son Richard, who was displaced by the restoration of Charles II. Charles the Second, Charles II. enraged at the villainous deed, Tried to turn out old Cromwell, but could not succeed; But he mastered young Dick, and then cooled his own wrath In syllabub, trifle, and fillagree broth. A frivolous and dissolute king. James the Second, James II. with looks full of anger and gloom, Pronounced nothing good but the cookery of Rome; A bigoted Roman Catholic. So begged of King Arthur, his dear royal crony, To make all the company eat macaroni; Used violent measures to establish that religion in England. But Arthur bade Mary an orange present, Was obliged to fly the country; and the crown devolved to his daughter Mary, and her husband, William, Prince of Orange. At which James grew queasy, and fled from the tent. So she placed on his seat honest William, William III. her spouse, And with laurel and olive encircled his brows; His reign was distinguished by foreign victories and domestic prosperity. Wreath of glory and peace, by young Freedom entwined, By being the origin of the present form of the English constitution, in the glorious revolution of 1688; and by the life and writings of the philosopher Locke. And gave him a key to the lock By being the origin of the present form of the English constitution, in the glorious revolution of 1688; and by the life and writings of the philosopher Locke. of the mind. Now as Arthur continued the party to scan, He did not well know what to make of Queen Anne; Anne. But Marlborough, Her general, the Duke of Marlborough, gained several great victories in France. he saw, did her credit uplift, And he heartily laughed at the jokes of Dean Swift. Many eminent literary characters flourished in her time, particularly Swift and Pope. Then shook hands with two Georges, The House of Hanover. George I. George II.

Rogo vos, oportet, credatis, sunt mulieres plus sciæ, sunt nocturnæ, et quod sursum est deorsum faciunt. Petronius. The bards and sages of departed Greece Yet live, for mind survives material doom; Still, as of yore, beneath the myrtle bloom They strike their golden lyres, in sylvan peace. Wisdom and Liberty may never cease, Once having been, to be: but from the tomb Their mighty radiance streams along the gloom Of ages evermore without decrease. Among those gifted bards and sages old, Shunning the living world, I dwell, and hear, Reverent, the creeds they held, the tales they told: And from the songs that charmed their latest ear, A yet ungathered wreath, with fingers bold, I weave, of bleeding love and magic mysteries drear. Canto I The rose and myrtle blend in beauty Round Thespian Love's hypæthric fane; And there alone, with festal duty Of joyous song and choral train, From many a mountain, stream, and vale, And many a city fair and free, The sons of Greece commingling hail Love's primogenial deity. Central amid the myrtle grove That venerable temple stands: Three statues, raised by gifted hands, Distinct with sculptured emblems fair, His threefold influence imaged bear, Creative, Heavenly, Earthly Love. Primogenial, or Creative Love, in the Orphic mythology, is the first-born of Night and Chaos, the most ancient of the gods, and the parent of all things. According to Aristophanes, Night produced an egg in the bosom of Erebus, and golden-winged Love burst in due season from the shell. The Egyptians, as Plutarch informs us in his Erotic dialogue, recognised three distinct powers of Love: the Uranian, or Heavenly; the Pandemian, Vulgar or Earthly; and the Sun. That the identity of the Sun and Primogenial Love was recognised also by the Greeks, appears from the community of their epithets in mythological poetry, as in this Orphic line: ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ????. Lactantius observes that Love was called ??????????, which signifies both first-produced and first-producing, because nothing was born before him, but all things have proceeded from him. Primogenial Love is represented in antiques mounted on the back of a lion, and, being of Egyptian origin, is traced by the modern astronomical interpreters of mythology to the Leo of the Zodiac. Uranian Love, in the mythological philosophy of Plato, is the deity or genius of pure mental passion for the good and the beautiful; and Pandemian Love, of ordinary sexual attachment. The first, of stone and sculpture rude, From immemorial time has stood; Not even in vague tradition known The hand that raised that ancient stone. Of brass the next, with holiest thought, The skill of Sicyon's artist Lysippus. wrought. The third, a marble form divine, That seems to move, and breathe, and smile, Fair Phryne to this holy shrine Conveyed, when her propitious wile Had forced her lover to impart The choicest treasure of his art. Phryne was the mistress of Praxiteles. She requested him to give her his most beautiful work, which he promised to do, but refused to tell which of his works was in his own estimation the best. One day when he was with Phryne, her servant running in announced to him that his house was on fire. Praxiteles started up in great agitation, declaring that all the fruit of his labour would be lost, if his Love should be injured by the flames. His mistress dispelled his alarm, by telling him that the report of the fire was merely a stratagem, by which she had obtained the information she desired. Phryne thus became possessed of the masterpiece of Praxiteles, and bestowed it on her native Thespia. Strabo names, instead of Phryne, Glycera, who was also a Thespian; but in addition to the testimony of Pausanias and Athenæus, Casaubon cites a Greek epigram on Phryne, which mentions her dedication of the Thespian Love. Her, too, in sculptured beauty's pride, His skill has placed by Venus' side; Nor well the enraptured gaze descries Which best might claim the Hesperian prize. Fairest youths and maids assembling Dance the myrtle bowers among: Harps to softest numbers trembling Pour the impassioned strain along, Where the poet's gifted song Holds the intensely listening throng. Matrons grave and sages grey Lead the youthful train to pay Homage on the opening day Of Love's returning festival: Every fruit and every flower Sacred to his gentler power, Twined in garlands bright and sweet, They place before his sculptured feet, And on his name they call: From thousand lips, with glad acclaim, Is breathed at once that sacred name; And music, kindling at the sound, Wafts holier, tenderer strains around: The rose a richer sweet exhales; The myrtle waves in softer gales; Through every breast one influence flies; All hate, all evil passion dies; The heart of man, in that blest spell, Becomes at once a sacred cell, Where Love, and only Love, can dwell. Sacrifices were offered at this festival for the appeasing of all public and private dissensions. Autobulus,in the beginning of Plutarch's Erotic dialogue, says, that his father and mother, when first married, went to the Thespian festival, to sacrifice to Love, on account of a quarrel between their parents. From Ladon's shores Anthemion came, Arcadian Ladon, loveliest tide Of all the streams of Grecian name Through rocks and sylvan hills that glide. The flower of all Arcadia's youth Was he: such form and face, in truth, As thoughts of gentlest maidens seek In their day-dreams: soft glossy hair Shadowed his forehead, snowy-fair, With many a hyacinthine cluster: Lips, that in silence seemed to speak, Were his, and eyes of mild blue lustre: And even the paleness of his cheek, The passing trace of tender care, Still shewed how beautiful it were If its own natural bloom were there. His native vale, whose mountains high The barriers of his world had been, His cottage home, and each dear scene His haunt from earliest infancy, He left, to Love's fair fane to bring His simple wild-flower offering. She with whose life his life was twined, His own Calliroë, long had pined With some strange ill, and none could find What secret cause did thus consume That peerless maiden's roseate bloom: The Asclepian sage's skill was vain; And vainly have their vows been paid To Pan, beneath the odorous shade Of his tall pine; and other aid Must needs be sought to save the maid: And hence Anthemion came, to try In Thespia's old solemnity, If such a lover's prayers may gain From Love in his primæval fane. He mingled in the votive train, That moved around the altar's base. Every statue's beauteous face Was turned towards that central altar. Why did Anthemion's footsteps falter? Why paused he, like a tale-struck child, Whom darkness fills with fancies wild? A vision strange his sense had bound: It seemed the brazen statue frowned— The marble statue smiled. A moment, and the semblance fled: And when again he lifts his head, Each sculptured face alone presents Its fixed and placid lineaments. He bore a simple wild-flower wreath: Narcissus, and the sweet-briar rose; Vervain, and flexile thyme, that breathe Rich fragrance; modest heath, that glows With purple bells; the amaranth bright, That no decay nor fading knows, Like true love's holiest, rarest light; And every purest flower, that blows In that sweet time, which Love most blesses, When spring on summer's confines presses. Beside the altar's foot he stands, And murmurs low his suppliant vow, And now uplifts with duteous hands The votive wild-flower wreath, and now— At once, as when in vernal night Comes pale frost or eastern blight, Sweeping with destructive wing Banks untimely blossoming, Droops the wreath, the wild-flowers die; One by one on earth they lie, Blighted strangely, suddenly. His brain swims round; portentous fear Across his wildered fancy flies: Shall death thus seize his maiden dear? Does Love reject his sacrifice? He caught the arm of a damsel near, And soft sweet accents smote his ear: —“What ails thee, stranger? Leaves are sear, And flowers are dead, and fields are drear, And streams are wild, and skies are bleak, And white with snow each mountain's peak, When winter rules the year; And children grieve, as if for aye Leaves, flowers, and birds were past away: But buds and blooms again are seen, And fields are gay, and hills are green, And streams are bright, and sweet birds sing; And where is the infant's sorrowing?”— Dimly he heard the words she said, Nor well their latent meaning drew; But languidly he raised his head, And on the damsel fixed his view. Was it a form of mortal mould That did his dazzled sense impress? Even painful from its loveliness! Her bright hair, in the noonbeams glowing, A rose-bud wreath above confined, From whence, as from a fountain, flowing, Long ringlets round her temples twined, And fell in many a graceful fold, Streaming in curls of feathery lightness Around her neck's marmoreal whiteness. Love, in the smile that round her lips, Twin roses of persuasion, played, —Nectaries of balmier sweets than sips The Hymettian bee,—his ambush laid; And his own shafts of liquid fire Came on the soul with sweet surprise, Through the soft dews of young desire That trembled in her large dark eyes; But in those eyes there seemed to move A flame, almost too bright for love, That shone, with intermitting flashes, Beneath their long deep-shadowy lashes. —“What ails thee, youth?”—her lips repeat, In tones more musically sweet Than breath of shepherd's twilight reed, From far to woodland echo borne, That floats like dew o'er stream and mead, And whispers peace to souls that mourn. —“What ails thee, youth?”—“A fearful sign For one whose dear sake led me hither: Love repels me from his shrine, And seems to say: That maid divine Like these ill-omened flowers shall wither.”— —“Flowers may die on many a stem; Fruits may fall from many a tree; Not the more for loss of them Shall this fair world a desert be: Thou in every grove wilt see Fruits and flowers enough for thee. Stranger! I with thee will share The votive fruits and flowers I bear, Rich in fragrance, fresh in bloom; These may find a happier doom: If they change not, fade not now, Deem that Love accepts thy vow.”— The youth, mistrustless, from the maid Received, and on the altar laid The votive wreath: it did not fade; And she on his her offering threw. Did fancy cloud Anthemion's view? Or did those sister garlands fair Indeed entwine and blend again, Wreathed into one, even as they were, Ere she, their brilliant sweets to share, Unwove their flowery chain? She fixed on him her radiant eyes, And—“Love's propitious power,”—she said,— “Accepts thy second sacrifice. The sun descends tow'rds ocean's bed. Day by day the sun doth set, And day by day the sun doth rise, And grass with evening dew-drops wet The morning radiance dries: And what if beauty slept, where peers That mossy grass? and lover's tears Were mingled with that evening dew? The morning sun would dry them too. Many a loving heart is near, That shall its plighted love forsake: Many lips are breathing here Vows a few short days will break: Many, lone amidst mankind, Claim from Love's unpitying power The kindred heart they ne'er shall find: Many, at this festal hour, Joyless in the joyous scene, Pass, with idle glance unmoved, Even those whom they could best have loved, Had means of mutual knowledge been: Some meet for once and part for aye, Like thee and me, and scarce a day Shall each by each remembered be: But take the flower I give to thee, And till it fades remember me.”— Anthemion answered not: his brain Was troubled with conflicting thought: A dim and dizzy sense of pain That maid's surpassing beauty brought; And strangely on his fancy wrought Her mystic moralisings, fraught With half-prophetic sense, and breathed In tones so sweetly wild. Unconsciously the flower he took, And with absorbed admiring look Gazed, as with fascinated eye The lone bard gazes on the sky, Who, in the bright clouds rolled and wreathed Around the sun's descending car, Sees shadowy rocks sublimely piled, And phantom standards wide unfurled, And towers of an aërial world Embattled for unearthly war. So stood Anthemion, till among The mazes of the festal throng The damsel from his sight had past: Yet well he marked that once she cast A backward look, perchance to see If he watched her still so fixedly. Canto II Does Love so weave his subtle spell, So closely bind his golden chain, That only one fair form may dwell In dear remembrance, and in vain May other beauty seek to gain A place that idol form beside In feelings all pre-occupied? Or does one radiant image, shrined Within the inmost soul's recess, Exalt, expand, and make the mind A temple, to receive and bless All forms of kindred loveliness? Howbeit, as from those myrtle bowers, And that bright altar crowned with flowers, Anthemion turned, as thought's wild stream Its interrupted course resumed, Still, like the phantom of a dream, Before his dazzled memory bloomed The image of that maiden strange: Yet not a passing thought of change He knew, nor once his fancy strayed From his long-loved Arcadian maid. Vaguely his mind the scene retraced, Image on image wildly driven, As in his bosom's fold he placed The flower that radiant nymph had given. With idle steps, at random bent, Through Thespia's crowded ways he went; And on his troubled ear the strains Of choral music idly smote; And with vacant eye he saw the trains Of youthful dancers round him float, As the musing bard from his sylvan seat Looks on the dance of the noontide heat, Or the play of the watery flowers, that quiver In the eddies of a lowland river. Around, beside him, to and fro, The assembled thousands hurrying go. These the palæstric sports invite, Where courage, strength, and skill contend; The gentler Muses those delight, Where throngs of silent listeners bend, While rival bards, with lips of fire, Attune to love the impassioned lyre; Or where the mimic scene displays Some solemn tale of elder days, Despairing Phædra's vengeful doom, Alcestis' love too dearly tried, Or Hæmon dying on the tomb That closes o'er his living bride. The allusions are to the Hippolytus and Alcestis of Euripides, and to the Antigone of Sophocles. But choral dance, and bardic strain, Palæstric sport, and scenic tale, Around Anthemion spread in vain Their mixed attractions: sad and pale He moved along, in musing sadness, Amid all sights and sounds of gladness. A sudden voice his musings broke. He looked; an aged man was near, Of rugged brow, and eye severe. —“What evil,”—thus the stranger spoke,— “Has this our city done to thee, Ill-omened boy, that thou should'st be A blot on our solemnity? Or what Alastor bade thee wear That laurel-rose, to Love profane, Whose leaves, in semblance falsely fair Of Love's maternal flower, contain For purest fragrance deadliest bane? ?? ?? ???? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ???????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ??? ?????? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ?????, ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? ??????????? ??????. Lucianus in Asino. —“These roses were not true roses: they were flowers of the wild laurel, which men call rhododaphne, or rose-laurel. It is a bad dinner for either horse or ass, the eating of it being attended by immediate death.” Apuleius has amplified this passage: “I observed from afar the deep shades of a leafy grove, through whose diversified and abundant verdure shone the snowy colour of refulgent roses. As my perceptions and feelings were not asinine like my shape, This is spoken in the character of Lucius, who has been changed to an ass by a Thessalian ointment, and can be restored to his true shape only by the eating of roses. I judged it to be a sacred grove of Venus and the Graces, where the celestial splendor of their genial flower glittered through the dark-green shades. I invoked the propitious power of joyful Event, and sprang forward with such velocity, as if I were not indeed an ass, but the horse of an Olympic charioteer. But this splendid effort of energy could not enable me to outrun the cruelty of my fortune. For on approaching the spot, I saw, not those tender and delicate roses, the offspring of auspicious bushes, whose fragrant leaves make nectar of the morning-dew; nor yet the deep wood I had seemed to see from afar; but only a thick line of trees skirting the edge of a river. These trees, clothed with an abundant and laurel-like foliage, from which they stretch forth the cups of their pale and inodorous flowers, are called, among the unlearned rustics, by the far from rustic appellation of laurel-roses: the eating of which is mortal to all quadrupeds. Thus entangled by evil fate, and despairing of safety, I was on the point of swallowing the poison of those fictitious roses, &amp;c.” Pliny says, that this plant, though poison to quadrupeds, is an antidote to men against the venom of serpents. Art thou a scorner? dost thou throw Defiance at his power? Beware! Full soon thy impious youth may know What pangs his shafts of anger bear; For not the sun's descending dart, Nor yet the lightning-brand of Jove, Fall like the shaft that strikes the heart Thrown by the mightier hand of Love.”— —“Oh stranger! not with impious thought My steps this holy rite have sought. With pious heart and offerings due I mingled in the votive train; Nor did I deem this flower profane; Nor she, I ween, its evil knew, That radiant girl, who bade me cherish Her memory till its bloom should perish.”— —“Who, and what, and whence was she?”— —“A stranger till this hour to me.”— —“Oh youth, beware! that laurel-rose Around Larissa's evil walls In tufts of rank luxuriance grows, Mid dreary valleys, by the falls Of haunted streams; and magic knows No herb or plant of deadlier might, When impious footsteps wake by night The echoes of those dismal dells, What time the murky midnight dew Trembles on many a leaf and blossom, That draws from earth's polluted bosom Mysterious virtue, to imbue The chalice of unnatural spells. Oft, those dreary rocks among, The murmurs of unholy song, Breathed by lips as fair as hers By whose false hands that flower was given, The solid earth's firm breast have riven, And burst the silent sepulchres, And called strange shapes of ghastly fear, To hold, beneath the sickening moon, Portentous parle, at night's deep noon, With beauty skilled in mysteries drear. Oh, youth! Larissa's maids are fair; But the dæmons of the earth and air Their spells obey, their councils share, And wide o'er earth and ocean bear Their mandates to the storms that tear The rock-enrooted oak, and sweep With whirlwind wings the labouring deep. Their words of power can make the streams Roll refluent on their mountain-springs, Can torture sleep with direful dreams, And on the shapes of earthly things, Man, beast, bird, fish, with influence strange, Breathe foul and fearful interchange, And fix in marble bonds the form Erewhile with natural being warm, And give to senseless stones and stocks Motion, and breath, and shape that mocks, As far as nicest eye can scan, The action and the life of man. Beware! yet once again beware! Ere round thy inexperienced mind, With voice and semblance falsely fair, A chain Thessalian magic bind, Which never more, oh youth! believe, Shall either earth or heaven unweave.”— While yet he spoke, the morning scene, In more portentous hues arrayed, Dwelt on Anthemion's mind: a shade Of deeper mystery veiled the mien And words of that refulgent maid. The frown, that, ere he breathed his vow, Dwelt on the brazen statue's brow; His votive flowers, so strangely blighted; The wreath her beauteous hands untwined To share with him, that, self-combined, Its sister tendrils reunited, Strange sympathy! as in his mind These forms of troubled memory blended With dreams of evil undefined, Of magic and Thessalian guile, Now by the warning voice portended Of that mysterious man, awhile, Even when the stranger's speech had ended, He stood as if he listened still. At length he said:—“Oh, reverend stranger! Thy solemn words are words of fear. Not for myself I shrink from danger; But there is one to me more dear Than all within this earthly sphere, And many are the omens ill That threaten her: to Jove's high will We bow; but if in human skill Be ought of aid or expiation That may this peril turn away, For old Experience holds his station On that grave brow, oh stranger! say.”— —“Oh youth! experience sad indeed Is mine; and should I tell my tale, Therein thou might'st too clearly read How little may all aid avail To him, whose hapless steps around Thessalian spells their chains have bound: And yet such counsel as I may I give to thee. Ere close of day Seek thou the planes, whose broad shades fall On the stream that laves yon mountain's base: There on thy Natal Genius call The plane was sacred to the Genius, as the oak to Jupiter, the olive to Minerva, the palm to the Muses, the myrtle and rose to Venus, the laurel to Apollo, the ash to Mars, the beech to Hercules, the pine to Pan, the fir and ivy to Bacchus, the cypress to Sylvanus, the cedar to the Eumenides, the yew and poppy to Ceres, &amp;c. “I swear to you,” says Socrates in the Phædrus of Plato, “by any one of the gods, if you will, by this plane.” For aid, and with averted face Give to the stream that flower, nor look Upon the running wave again; For, if thou should'st, the sacred plane Has heard thy suppliant vows in vain; Nor then thy Natal Genius can, Nor Phœbus, nor Arcadian Pan, Dissolve thy tenfold chain.”— The stranger said, and turned away. Anthemion sought the plane-grove's shade. 'Twas near the closing hour of day. The slanting sunbeam's golden ray, That through the massy foliage made Scarce here and there a passage, played Upon the silver-eddying stream, Even on the rocky channel throwing Through the clear flood its golden gleam. The bright waves danced beneath the beam To the music of their own sweet flowing. The flowering sallows on the bank, Beneath the o'ershadowing plane-trees wreathing In sweet association, drank The grateful moisture, round them breathing Soft fragrance through the lonely wood. There, where the mingling foliage wove Its closest bower, two altars stood, This to the Genius of the Grove, That to the Naiad of the Flood. So light a breath was on the trees, That rather like a spirit's sigh Than motion of an earthly breeze, Among the summits broad and high Of those tall planes its whispers stirred; And save that gentlest symphony Of air and stream, no sound was heard, But of the solitary bird, That aye, at summer's evening hour, When music save her own is none, Attunes, from her invisible bower, Her hymn to the descending sun. Anthemion paused upon the shore: All thought of magic's impious lore, All dread of evil powers, combined Against his peace, attempered ill With that sweet scene; and on his mind, Fair, graceful, gentle, radiant still, The form of that strange damsel came; And something like a sense of shame He felt, as if his coward thought Foul wrong to guileless beauty wrought. At length—“Oh radiant girl!”—he said,— “If in the cause that bids me tread These banks, be mixed injurious dread Of thy fair thoughts, the fears of love Must with thy injured kindness plead My pardon for the wrongful deed. Ye Nymphs and Sylvan Gods, that rove The precincts of this sacred wood! Thou, Achelöus' gentle daughter, Bright Naiad of this beauteous water! And thou, my Natal Genius good! Lo! with pure hands the crystal flood Collecting, on these altars blest, Libation holiest, brightest, best, I pour. If round my footsteps dwell Unholy sign or evil spell, Receive me in your guardian sway; And thou, oh gentle Naiad! bear With this false flower those spells away, If such be lingering there.”— Then from the stream he turned his view, And o'er his back the flower he threw. Hark! from the wave a sudden cry, Of one in last extremity, A voice as of a drowning maid! The echoes of the sylvan shade Gave response long and drear. He starts: he does not turn. Again! It is Calliroë's cry! In vain Could that dear maiden's cry of pain Strike on Anthemion's ear? At once, forgetting all beside, He turned to plunge into the tide, But all again was still: The sun upon the surface bright Poured his last line of crimson light, Half-sunk behind the hill: But through the solemn plane-trees past The pinions of a mightier blast, And in its many-sounding sweep, Among the foliage broad and deep, Aërial voices seemed to sigh, As if the spirits of the grove Mourned, in prophetic sympathy With some disastrous love. Canto III By living streams, in sylvan shades, Where winds and waves symphonious make Sweet melody, the youths and maids No more with choral music wake Lone Echo from her tangled brake, On Pan, or Sylvan Genius, calling, Naiad or Nymph, in suppliant song: No more by living fountain, falling The poplar's circling bower among, Where pious hands have carved of yore Rude bason for its lucid store And reared the grassy altar nigh, The traveller, when the sun rides high, For cool refreshment lingering there, Pours to the Sister Nymphs his prayer. Yet still the green vales smile: the springs Gush forth in light: the forest weaves Its own wild bowers; the breeze's wings Make music in their rustling leaves; But 'tis no spirit's breath that sighs Among their tangled canopies: In ocean's caves no Nereid dwells: No Oread walks the mountain-dells: The streams no sedge-crowned Genii roll From bounteous urn: great Pan is dead: The life, the intellectual soul Of vale, and grove, and stream, has fled For ever with the creed sublime That nursed the Muse of earlier time. The broad moon rose o'er Thespia's walls And on the light wind's swells and falls Came to Anthemion's ear the sounds Of dance, and song, and festal pleasure, As slowly tow'rds the city's bounds He turned, his backward steps to measure. But with such sounds his heart confessed No sympathy: his mind was pressed With thoughts too heavy to endure The contrast of a scene so gay; And from the walls he turned away, To where, in distant moonlight pure, Mount Helicon's conspicuous height Rose in the dark-blue vault of night. Along the solitary road Alone he went; for who but he On that fair night would absent be From Thespia's joyous revelry? The sounds that on the soft air flowed By slow degrees in distance died: And now he climbed the rock's steep side, Where frowned o'er sterile regions wide Neptunian Ascra's Ascra derived its name from a nymph, of whom Neptune was enamoured. She bore him a son named Œoclus, who built Ascra in conjunction with the giants Ophus and Ephialtes, who were also sons of Neptune, by Iphimedia, the wife of Alœus. Pausanias mentions, that nothing but a solitary tower of Ascra was remaining in his time. Strabo describes it as having a lofty and rugged site. It was the birth-place of Hesiod, who gives a dismal picture of it. ruined tower: Memorial of gigantic power: But thoughts more dear and more refined Awakening, in the pensive mind, Of him, the Muses' gentlest son, The shepherd-bard of Helicon, Whose song, to peace and wisdom dear, The Aonian Dryads loved to hear. By Aganippe's fountain-wave Anthemion passed: the moonbeams fell Pale on the darkness of the cave, Within whose mossy rock-hewn cell The sculptured form of Linus stood, Primæval bard. The Nymphs for him Through every spring, and mountain flood, Green vale, and twilight woodland dim, Long wept: all living nature wept For Linus; when, in minstrel strife, Apollo's wrath from love and life The child of music swept. The Muses' grove is nigh. He treads Its sacred precincts. O'er him spreads The palm's aërial canopy, That, nurtured by perennial springs, Around its summit broad and high Its light and branchy foliage flings, Arching in graceful symmetry. Among the tall stems jagg'd and bare Luxuriant laurel interweaves An undershade of myriad leaves, Here black in rayless masses, there In partial moonlight glittering fair; And wheresoe'er the barren rock Peers through the grassy soil, its roots The sweet andrachne “The andrachne,” says Pausanias, “grows abundantly in Helicon, and bears fruit of incomparable sweetness.”—Pliny says, “It is the same plant which is called in Latin illecebra: it grows on rocks, and is gathered for food.” strikes, to mock Sterility, and profusely shoots Its light boughs, rich with ripening fruits. The moonbeams, through the chequering shade, Upon the silent temple played, The Muses' fane. The nightingale, Those consecrated bowers among, Poured on the air a warbled tale, So sweet, that scarcely from her nest, Where Orpheus' hallowed relics rest, She breathes a sweeter song. It was said by the Thracians, that those nightingales which had their nests about the tomb of Orpheus, sang more sweetly and powerfully than any others. Pausanias, L. IX. A scene, whose power the maniac sense Of passion's wildest mood might own! Anthemion felt its influence: His fancy drank the soothing tone Of all that tranquil loveliness; And health and bloom returned to bless His dear Calliroë, and the groves And rocks where pastoral Ladon roves Bore record of their blissful loves. List! there is music on the wind! Sweet music! seldom mortal ear On sounds so tender, so refined, Has dwelt. Perchance some Muse is near, Euterpe, or Polymnia bright, Or Erato, whose gentle lyre Responds to love and young desire! It is the central hour of night: The time is holy, lone, severe, And mortals may not linger here! Still on the air those wild notes fling Their airy spells of voice and string, In sweet accordance, sweeter made By response soft from caverned shade. He turns to where a lovely glade Sleeps in the open moonlight's smile, A natural fane, whose ample bound The palm's columnar stems surround, A wild and stately peristyle; Save where their interrupted ring Bends on the consecrated cave, From whose dark arch, with tuneful wave, Libethrus issues, sacred spring. Beside its gentle murmuring, A maiden, on a mossy stone, Full in the moonlight, sits alone: Her eyes, with humid radiance bright, As if a tear had dimmed their light, Are fixed upon the moon; her hair Flows long and loose in the light soft air; A golden lyre her white hands bear; Its chords, beneath her fingers fleet, To such wild symphonies awake, Her sweet lips breathe a song so sweet, That the echoes of the cave repeat Its closes with as soft a sigh, As if they almost feared to break The magic of its harmony. Oh! there was passion in the sound, Intensest passion, strange and deep; Wild breathings of a soul, around Whose every pulse one hope had bound, One burning hope, which might not sleep. But hark! that wild and solemn swell! And was there in those tones a spell, Which none may disobey? For lo! Anthemion from the sylvan shade Moves with reluctant steps and slow, And in the lonely moonlight glade He stands before the radiant maid. She ceased her song, and with a smile She welcomed him, but nothing said: And silently he stood the while, And tow'rds the ground he drooped his head, As if he shrunk beneath the light Of those dark eyes so dazzling bright. At length she spoke:—“The flower was fair I bade thee till its fading wear: And didst thou scorn the boon, Or died the flower so soon?”— —“It did not fade, Oh radiant maid! But Thespia's rites its use forbade, To Love's vindictive power profane: If soothly spoke the reverend seer, Whose voice rebuked, with words severe, Its beauty's secret bane.”— —“The world, oh youth! deems many wise, Who dream at noon with waking eyes, While spectral fancy round them flings Phantoms of unexisting things; Whose truth is lies, whose paths are error, Whose gods are fiends, whose heaven is terror; And such a slave has been with thee, And thou, in thy simplicity, Hast deemed his idle sayings truth. The flower I gave thee, thankless youth! The harmless flower thy hand rejected, Was fair: my native river sees Its verdure and its bloom reflected Wave in the eddies and the breeze. My mother felt its beauty's claim, And gave, in sportive fondness wild, Its name to me, her only child.”— —“Then Rhododaphne is thy name?”— Anthemion said: the maiden bent Her head in token of assent. —“Say once again, if sooth I deem, Penëus is thy native stream?”— —“Down Pindus' steep Penëus falls, And swift and clear through hill and dale It flows, and by Larissa's walls, And through wild Tempe, loveliest vale; And on its banks the cypress gloom Waves round my father's lonely tomb. My mother's only child am I: Mid Tempe's sylvan rocks we dwell; And from my earliest infancy, The darling of our cottage-dell For its bright leaves and clusters fair, My namesake flower has bound my hair. With costly gift and flattering song, Youths, rich and valiant, sought my love. They moved me not. I shunned the throng Of suitors, for the mountain-grove Where Sylvan Gods and Oreads rove. The Muses, whom I worship here, Had breathed their influence on my being, Keeping my youthful spirit clear From all corrupting thoughts, and freeing My footsteps from the crowd, to tread Beside the torrent's echoing bed, Mid wind-tost pines, on steeps aërial, Where elemental Genii throw Effluence of natures more ethereal Than vulgar minds can feel or know. Oft on those steeps, at earliest dawn, The world in mist beneath me lay, Whose vapory curtains, half withdrawn, Revealed the flow of Therma's bay, Red with the nascent light of day; Till full from Athos' distant height The sun poured down his golden beams Scattering the mists like morning dreams, And rocks and lakes and isles and streams Burst, like creation, into light. In noontide bowers the bubbling springs, In evening vales the winds that sigh To eddying rivers murmuring by, Have heard to these symphonious strings The rocks and caverned glens reply. Spirits that love the moonlight hour Have met me on the shadowy hill: Dream'st thou of Magic? of the power That makes the blood of life run chill, And shakes the world with dæmon skill? Beauty is Magic; grace and song; Fair form, light motion, airy sound: Frail webs! and yet a chain more strong They weave the strongest hearts around, Then e'er Alcides' arm unbound: And such a chain I weave round thee, Though but with mortal witchery.”— His eyes and ears had drank the charm. The damsel rose, and on his arm She laid her hand. Through all his frame The soft touch thrilled like liquid flame; But on his mind Calliroë came All pale and sad, her sweet eyes dim With tears which for herself and him Fell: by that modest image mild Recalled, inspired, Anthemion strove Against the charm that now beguiled His sense, and cried, in accents wild, —“Oh maid! I have another love!”— But still she held his arm, and spoke Again in accents thrilling sweet: —“In Tempe's vale a lonely oak Has felt the storms of ages beat: Blasted by the lightning-stroke, A hollow, leafless, branchless trunk It stands; but in its giant cell A mighty sylvan power doth dwell, An old and holy oracle. Kneeling by that ancient tree, I sought the voice of destiny, And in my ear these accents sunk: ‘Waste not in loneliness thy bloom: With flowers the Thespian altar dress: The youth whom Love's mysterious doom Assigns to thee, thy sight shall bless With no ambiguous loveliness; And thou, amid the joyous scene, Shalt know him, by his mournful mien, And by the paleness of his cheek, And by the sadness of his eye, And by his withered flowers, and by The language thy own heart shall speak.’ And I did know thee, youth! and thou Art mine, and I thy bride must be. Another love! the gods allow No other love to thee or me!”— She gathered up her glittering hair, And round his neck its tresses threw, And twined her arms of beauty rare Around him, and the light curls drew In closer bands: ethereal dew Of love and young desire was swimming In her bright eyes, albeit not dimming Their starry radiance, rather brightning Their beams with passion's liquid lightning. She clasped him to her throbbing breast, And on his lips her lips she prest, And cried the while With joyous smile: —“These lips are mine; the spells have won them, Which round and round thy soul I twine; And be the kiss I print upon them Poison to all lips but mine!”— Dizzy awhile Anthemion stood, With thirst-parched lips and fevered blood, In those enchanting ringlets twined: The fane, the cave, the moonlight wood, The world, and all the world enshrined, Seemed melting from his troubled mind: But those last words the thought recalled Of his Calliroë, and appalled His mind with many a nameless fear For her, so good, so mild, so dear. With sudden start of gentle force From Rhododaphne's arms he sprung, And swifter than the torrent's course From rock to rock in tumult flung, Adown the steeps of Helicon, By spring, and cave, and tower, he fled, But turned from Thespia's walls, and on Along the rocky way, that led Tow'rds the Corinthian Isthmus, sped, Impatient to behold again His cottage-home by Ladon's side, And her, for whose dear sake his brain Was giddy with foreboding pain, Fairest of Ladon's virgin train, His own long-destined bride. Canto IV Magic and mystery, spells Circæan, The Siren voice, that calmed the sea, And steeped the soul in dews Lethæan; The enchanted chalice, sparkling free With wine, amid whose ruby glow Love couched, with madness linked and woe; Mantle and zone, whose woof beneath Lurked wily grace, in subtle wreath With blandishment and young desire And soft persuasion intertwined, Whose touch, with sympathetic fire, Could melt at once the sternest mind; Have passed away: for vestal Truth Young Fancy's foe, and Reason chill, Have chased the dreams that charmed the youth Of nature and the world, which still, Amid that vestal light severe, Our colder spirits leap to hear Like echoes from a fairy hill. Yet deem not so. The Power of Spells Still lingers on the earth, but dwells In deeper folds of close disguise, That baffle Reason's searching eyes: Nor shall that mystic Power resign To Truth's cold sway his webs of guile, Till woman's eyes have ceased to shine, And woman's lips have ceased to smile, And woman's voice has ceased to be The earthly soul of melody. A night and day had passed away: A second night. A second day Had risen. The noon on vale and hill Was glowing, and the pensive herds In rocky pool and sylvan rill The shadowy coolness sought. The birds Among their leafy bowers were still, Save where the red-breast on the pine, In thickest ivy's sheltering nest, Attuned a lonely song divine, To soothe old Pan's meridian rest. It was the custom of Pan to repose from the chace at noon. Theocritus, Id. I. The stream's eternal eddies played In light and music; on its edge The soft light air scarce moved the sedge: The bees a pleasant murmuring made On thymy bank and flowery hedge: From field to field the grasshopper Kept up his joyous descant shrill; When once again the wanderer, With arduous travel faint and pale, Beheld his own Arcadian vale. From Oryx, down the sylvan way, With hurried pace the youth proceeds. Sweet Ladon's waves beside him stray In dear companionship: the reeds Seem, whispering on the margin clear, The doom of Syrinx to rehearse, Ladonian Syrinx, name most dear To music and Mænalian verse. It is the Aphrodisian grove. Anthemion's home is near. He sees The light smoke rising from the trees That shade the dwelling of his love. Sad bodings, shadowy fears of ill, Pressed heavier on him, in wild strife With many-wandering hope, that still Leaves on the darkest clouds of life Some vestige of her radiant way: But soon those torturing struggles end; For where the poplar silver-grey And dark associate cedar blend Their hospitable shade, before One human dwelling's well-known door, Old Pheidon sits, and by his side His only child, his age's pride, Herself, Anthemion's destined bride. She hears his coming tread. She flies To meet him. Health is on her cheeks, And pleasure sparkles in her eyes, And their soft light a welcome speaks More eloquent than words. Oh, joy! The maid he left so fast consuming, Whom death, impatient to destroy, Had marked his prey, now rosy-blooming, And beaming like the morning star With loveliness and love, has flown To welcome him: his cares fly far, Like clouds when storms are overblown; For where such perfect transports reign Even memory has no place for pain. The poet's task were passing sweet, If, when he tells how lovers meet, One half the flow of joy, that flings Its magic on that blissful hour, Could touch, with sympathetic power, His lyre's accordant strings. It may not be. The lyre is mute, When venturous minstrelsy would suit Its numbers to so dear a theme: But many a gentle maid, I deem, Whose heart has known and felt the like, Can hear, in fancy's kinder dream, The chords I dare not strike. They spread a banquet in the shade Of those old trees. The friendly board Calliroë's beauteous hands arrayed, With self-requiting toil, and poured In fair-carved bowl the sparkling wine. In order due Anthemion made Libation, to Olympian Jove, Arcadian Pan, and Thespian Love, And Bacchus, giver of the vine. The generous draught dispelled the sense Of weariness. His limbs were light: His heart was free: Love banished thence All forms but one most dear, most bright: And ever with insatiate sight He gazed upon the maid, and listened, Absorbed in ever new delight, To that dear voice, whose balmy sighing To his full joy blest response gave, Like music doubly-sweet replying From twilight echo's sylvan cave; And her mild eyes with soft rays glistened, Imparting and reflecting pleasure; For this is Love's terrestrial treasure, That in participation lives, And evermore, the more it gives, Itself abounds in fuller measure. Old Pheidon felt his heart expand With joy that from their joy had birth, And said:—“Anthemion! Love's own hand Is here, and mighty on the earth Is he, the primogenial power, Whose sacred grove and antique fane Thy prompted footsteps, not in vain, Have sought; for, on the day and hour Of his incipient rite, most strange And sudden was Calliroë's change. The sickness under which she bowed, Swiftly, as though it ne'er had been, Passed, like the shadow of a cloud From April's hills of green. And bliss once more is yours; and mine In seeing yours, and more than this; For ever, in our children's bliss, The sun of our past youth doth shine Upon our age anew. Divine No less than our own Pan must be To us Love's bounteous deity; And round our old and hallowed pine The myrtle and the rose must twine, Memorial of the Thespian shrine.”— 'Twas strange indeed, Anthemion thought, That, in the hour when omens dread Most tortured him, such change was wrought; But love and hope their lustre shed On all his visions now, and led His memory from the mystic train Of fears which that strange damsel wove Around him in the Thespian fane And in the Heliconian grove. Eve came, and twilight's balmy hour: Alone, beneath the cedar bower, The lovers sate, in converse dear Retracing many a backward year, Their infant sports in field and grove, Their mutual tasks, their dawning love, Their mingled tears of past distress, Now all absorbed in happiness; And oft would Fancy intervene, To throw, on many a pictured scene Of life's untrodden path, such gleams Of golden light, such blissful dreams, As in young Love's enraptured eye Hope almost made reality. So in that dear accustomed shade, With Ladon flowing at their feet, Together sate the youth and maid, In that uncertain shadowy light When day and darkness mingling meet. Her bright eyes ne'er had seemed so bright, Her sweet voice ne'er had seemed so sweet, As then they seemed. Upon his neck Her head was resting, and her eyes Were raised to his, for no disguise Her feelings knew; untaught to check, As in these days more worldly wise, The heart's best purest sympathies. Fond youth! her lips are near to thine: The ringlets of her temples twine Against thy cheek: oh! more or less Than mortal wert thou not to press Those ruby lips! Or does it dwell Upon thy mind, that fervid spell Which Rhododaphne breathed upon Thy lips erewhile in Helicon? Ah! pause, rash boy! bethink thee yet: And canst thou then the charm forget? Or dost thou scorn its import vain As vision of a fevered brain? Oh! he has kissed Calliroë's lips! And with the touch the maid grew pale, And sudden shade of strange eclipse Drew o'er her eyes its dusky veil. As droops the meadow-pink its head, By the rude scythe in summer's prime Cleft from its parent stem, and spread On earth to wither ere its time, Even so the flower of Ladon faded, Swifter than, when the sun hath shaded In the young storm his setting ray, The western radiance dies away. He pressed her heart: no pulse was there. Before her lips his hand he placed: No breath was in them. Wild despair Came on him, as, with sudden waste, When snows dissolve in vernal rain, The mountain-torrent on the plain Descends; and with that fearful swell Of passionate grief, the midnight spell Of the Thessalian maid recurred, Distinct in every fatal word: —“These lips are mine; the spells have won them, Which round and round thy soul I twine; And be the kiss I print upon them Poison to all lips but mine!”— —“Oh, thou art dead, my love!”—he cried— “Art dead, and I have murdered thee!”— He started up in agony. The beauteous maiden from his side Sunk down on earth. Like one who slept She lay, still, cold, and pale of hue; And her long hair all loosely swept The thin grass, wet with evening dew. He could not weep; but anguish burned Within him like consuming flame. He shrieked: the distant rocks returned The voice of woe. Old Pheidon came In terror forth: he saw; and wild With misery fell upon his child, And cried aloud, and rent his hair. Stung by the voice of his despair, And by the intolerable thought That he, how innocent soe'er, Had all this grief and ruin wrought, And urged perchance by secret might Of magic spells, that drew their chain More closely round his phrensied brain, Beneath the swiftly-closing night Anthemion sprang away, and fled O'er plain and steep, with frantic tread, As Passion's aimless impulse led. Canto V Though Pity's self has made thy breast Its earthly shrine, oh gentle maid! Shed not thy tears, where Love's last rest Is sweet beneath the cypress shade; Whence never voice of tyrant power, Nor trumpet-blast from rending skies, Nor winds that howl, nor storms that lower, Shall bid the sleeping sufferer rise. But mourn for them, who live to keep Sad strife with fortune's tempests rude; For them, who live to toil and weep In loveless, joyless solitude; Whose days consume in hope, that flies Like clouds of gold that fading float, Still watched with fondlier lingering eyes As still more dim and more remote. Oh! wisely, truly, sadly sung The bard by old Cephisus' side, —Sophocles, Œd. Col. ?? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ??, ???? ????, ????? ?????? ???? ??? ????, ???? ????????, ?? ???????. This was a very favorite sentiment among the Greeks. The same thought occurs in Ecclesiastes, iv. 2, 3. (While not with sadder, sweeter tongue, His own loved nightingale replied:) —“Man's happiest lot is not to be; And when we tread life's thorny steep, Most blest are they, who, earliest free, Descend to death's eternal sleep.”— Long, wide, and far, the youth has strayed, Forlorn, and pale, and wild with woe, And found no rest. His loved, lost maid, A beauteous, sadly-smiling shade, Is ever in his thoughts, and slow Roll on the hopeless, aimless hours. Sunshine, and grass, and woods, and flowers, Rivers, and vales, and glittering homes Of busy men, where'er he roams, Torment his sense with contrast keen, Of that which is, and might have been. The mist that on the mountains high Its transient wreath light-hovering flings, The clouds and changes of the sky, The forms of unsubstantial things, The voice of the tempestuous gale, The rain-swoln torrent's turbid moan, And every sound that seems to wail For beauty past and hope o'erthrown, Attemper with his wild despair; But scarce his restless eye can bear The hills, and rocks, and summer streams, The things that still are what they were When life and love were more than dreams. It chanced, along the rugged shore, Where giant Pelion's piny steep O'erlooks the wide Ægean deep, He shunned the steps of humankind, Soothed by the multitudinous roar Of ocean, and the ceaseless shock Of spray, high-scattering from the rock In the wail of the many-wandering wind. A crew, on lawless venture bound, Such men as roam the seas around, Hearts to fear and pity strangers, Seeking gold through crimes and dangers, Sailing near, the wanderer spied. Sudden, through the foaming tide, They drove to land, and on the shore Springing, they seized the youth, and bore To their black ship, and spread again Their sails, and ploughed the billowy main. Dark Ossa on their watery way Looks from his robe of mist; and, grey With many a deep and shadowy fold, The sacred mount, Olympus old, Appears: but where with Therma's sea Penëus mingles tranquilly, They anchor with the closing light Of day, and through the moonless night Propitious to their lawless toil, In silent bands they prowl for spoil. Ere morning dawns, they crowd on board, And to their vessel's secret hoard With many a costly robe they pass, And vase of silver, gold, and brass. A young maid too their hands have torn From her maternal home, to mourn Afar, to some rude master sold, The crimes and woes that spring from gold. —“There sit!”—cried one in rugged tone,— “Beside that boy. A well-matched pair Ye seem, and will, I doubt not, bear, In our good port, a value rare. There sit, but not to wail and moan: The lyre, which in those fingers fair We leave, whose sound through night's thick shade To unwished ears thy haunt bewrayed, Strike; for the lyre, by beauty played, To glad the hearts of men was made.”— The damsel by Anthemion's side Sate down upon the deck. The tide Blushed with the deepening light of morn. A pitying look the youth forlorn Turned on the maiden. Can it be? Or does his sense play false? Too well He knows that radiant form. 'Tis she, The magic maid of Thessaly, 'Tis Rhododaphne! By the spell, That ever round him dwelt, opprest, He bowed his head upon his breast, And o'er his eyes his hand he drew, That fatal beauty's sight to shun. Now from the orient heaven the sun Had clothed the eastward waves with fire: Right from the west the fair breeze blew: The full sails swelled, and sparkling through The sounding sea the vessel flew: With wine and copious cheer the crew Caroused: the damsel o'er the lyre Her rapid fingers lightly flung, And thus, with feigned obedience, sung. —“The Nereid's home is calm and bright, The ocean-depths below, Where liquid streams of emerald light Through caves of coral flow. She has a lyre of silver strings Framed on a pearly shell, And sweetly to that lyre she sings The shipwrecked seaman's knell. The ocean-snake in sleep she binds; The dolphins round her play: His purple conch the Triton winds Responsive to the lay: Proteus and Phorcys, sea-gods old, Watch by her coral cell, To hear, on watery echoes rolled, The shipwrecked seaman's knell.”— —“Cease!”—cried the chief in accents rude— “From songs like these mishap may rise. Thus far have we our course pursued With smiling seas and cloudless skies. From wreck and tempest, omens ill, Forbear; and sing, for well I deem Those pretty lips possess the skill, Some ancient tale of happier theme; Some legend of imperial Jove, In uncouth shapes disguised by love; Or Hercules, and his hard toils; Or Mercury, friend of craft and spoils; Or Jove-born Bacchus, whom we prize O'er all the Olympian deities.”— He said, and drained the bowl. The crew With long coarse laugh applauded. Fast With sparkling keel the vessel flew, For there was magic in the breeze That urged her through the sounding seas. By Chanastræum's point they past, And Ampelos. Grey Athos, vast With woods far-stretching to the sea, Was full before them, while the maid Again her lyre's wild strings assayed, In notes of bolder melody: —“Bacchus by the lonely ocean Stood in youthful semblance fair: Summer winds, with gentle motion, Waved his black and curling hair. Streaming from his manly shoulders Robes of gold and purple dye Told of spoil to fierce beholders In their black ship sailing by. On the vessel's deck they placed him Strongly bound in triple bands; But the iron rings that braced him Melted, wax-like, from his hands. Then the pilot spake in terror: —‘'Tis a god in mortal form! Seek the land; repair your error Ere his wrath invoke the storm.’— —‘Silence!’—cried the frowning master,— Mind the helm: the breeze is fair: Coward! cease to bode disaster: Leave to men the captive's care.’— While he speaks and fiercely tightens In the full free breeze the sail, From the deck wine bubbling lightens, Winy fragrance fills the gale. Gurgling in ambrosial lustre Flows the purple-eddying wine: O'er the yard-arms trail and cluster Tendrils of the mantling vine: Grapes, beneath the broad leaves springing, Blushing as in vintage-hours, Droop, while round the tall mast clinging Ivy twines its buds and flowers, Fast with graceful berries blackening:— Garlands hang on every oar: Then in fear the cordage slackening, One and all they cry,—‘To shore!’— Bacchus changed his shape, and glaring With a lion's eyeballs wide, Roared: the pirate-crew, despairing, Plunged amid the foaming tide. Through the azure depths they flitted Dolphins by transforming fate: But the god the pilot pitied, Saved, and made him rich and great.”— The crew laid by their cups, and frowned. A stern rebuke the leader gave. With arrowy speed the ship went round Nymphæum. To the ocean-wave The mountain-forest sloped, and cast O'er the white surf its massy shade. They heard, so near the shore they past, The hollow sound the sea-breeze made, As those primæval trees it swayed. —“Curse on thy songs!”—the leader cried,— “False tales of evil augury!”— —“Well hast thou said,”—the maid replied,— “They augur ill to thine and thee.”— She rose, and loosed her radiant hair, And raised her golden lyre in air. The lyre, beneath the breeze's wings, As if a spirit swept the strings, Breathed airy music, sweet and strange, In many a wild phantastic change. Most like a daughter of the Sun The children of the Sun were known by the splendor of their eyes and hair. ???? ??? ?????? ????? ???????? ??????? ???? ???? ???????? ?????????, ???????????? ???? ?? ??????? ???????? ????? ??????.

She stood: her eyes all radiant shone With beams unutterably bright; And her long tresses, loose and light, As on the playful breeze they rolled, Flamed with rays of burning gold. His wondering eyes Anthemion raised Upon the maid: the seamen gazed In fear and strange suspense, amazed. From the forest-depths profound Breathes a low and sullen sound: 'Tis the woodland spirit's sigh, Ever heard when storms are nigh. On the shore the surf that breaks With the rising breezes makes More tumultuous harmony. Louder yet the breezes sing: Round and round, in dizzy ring, Sea-birds scream on restless wing: Pine and cedar creak and swing To the sea-blast's murmuring. Far and wide on sand and shingle Eddying breakers boil and mingle: Beetling cliff and caverned rock Roll around the echoing shock, Where the spray, like snow-dust whirled, High in vapory wreaths is hurled. Clouds on clouds, in volumes driven, Curtain round the vault of heaven. —“To shore! to shore!”—the seamen cry. The damsel waved her lyre on high, And to the powers that rule the sea It whispered notes of witchery. Swifter than the lightning-flame The sudden breath of the whirlwind came. Round at once in its mighty sweep The vessel whirled on the whirling deep. Right from shore the driving gale Bends the mast and swells the sail: Loud the foaming ocean raves: Through the mighty waste of waves Speeds the vessel swift and free, Like a meteor of the sea. Day is ended. Darkness shrouds The shoreless seas and lowering clouds. Northward now the tempest blows: Fast and far the vessel goes: Crouched on deck the seamen lie; One and all, with charmed eye, On the magic maid they gaze: Nor the youth with less amaze Looks upon her radiant form Shining by the golden beams Of her refulgent hair, that streams Like waving star-light on the storm; And hears the vocal blast that rings Among her lyre's enchanted strings. Onward, onward flies the bark, Through the billows wild and dark. From her prow the spray she hurls; O'er her stern the big wave curls; Fast before the impetuous wind She flies—the wave bursts far behind. Onward, onward flies the bark, Through the raging billows:—Hark! 'Tis the stormy surge's roar On the Ægean's northern shore. Tow'rds the rocks, through surf and surge, The destined ship the wild winds urge. High on one gigantic wave She swings in air. From rock and cave A long loud wail of fate and fear Rings in the hopeless seaman's ear. Forward, with the breaker's dash, She plunges on the rock. The crash Of the dividing bark, the roar Of waters bursting on the deck, Are in Anthemion's ear: no more He hears or sees: but round his neck Are closely twined the silken rings Of Rhododaphne's glittering hair, And round him her bright arms she flings, And cinctured thus in loveliest bands The charmed waves in safety bear The youth and the enchantress fair, And leave them on the golden sands. Canto VI Hast thou, in some safe retreat, Waked and watched, to hear the roar Of breakers on the wind-swept shore? Go forth at morn. The waves, that beat Still rough and white when blasts are o'er, May wash, all ghastly, to thy feet Some victim of the midnight storm. From that drenched garb and pallid form Shrink not: but fix thy gaze, and see Thy own congenial destiny. For him, perhaps, an anxious wife On some far coast o'erlooks the wave: A child, unknowing of the strife Of elements, to whom he gave His last fond kiss, is at her breast: The skies are clear, the seas at rest Before her, and the hour is nigh Of his return: but black the sky To him, and fierce the hostile main, Have been. He will not come again. But yesterday, and life, and health, And hope, and love, and power, and wealth, Were his: to-day, in one brief hour, Of all his wealth, of all his power, He saved not, on his shattered deck, A plank, to waft him from the wreck. Now turn away, and dry thy tears, And build long schemes for distant years! Wreck is not only on the sea. The warrior dies in victory: The ruin of his natal roof O'erwhelms the sleeping man: the hoof Of his prized steed has struck with fate The horseman in his own home gate: The feast and mantling bowl destroy The sensual in the hour of joy. The bride from her paternal porch Comes forth among her maids: the torch, That led at morn the nuptial choir, Kindles at night her funeral pyre. Now turn away, indulge thy dreams, And build for distant years thy schemes! On Thracia's coast the morn was grey. Anthemion, with the opening day, From deep entrancement on the sands Stood up. The magic maid was there Beside him on the shore. Her hands Still held the golden lyre: her hair In all its long luxuriance hung Unringleted, and glittering bright With briny drops of diamond light: Her thin wet garments lightly clung Around her form's rare symmetry. Like Venus risen from the sea She seemed: so beautiful: and who With mortal sight such form could view, And deem that evil lurked beneath? Who could approach those starry eyes, Those dewy coral lips, that breathe Ambrosial fragrance, and that smile In which all Love's Elysium lies, Who this could see, and dream of guile, And brood on wrong and wrath the while? If there be one, who ne'er has felt Resolve, and doubt, and anger melt, Like vernal night-frosts, in one beam Of Beauty's sun, 'twere vain to deem, Between the Muse and him could be A link of human sympathy. Fain would the youth his lips unclose In keen reproach for all his woes And his Calliroë's doom. In vain: For closer now the magic chain Of the inextricable spell Involved him, and his accents fell Perplexed, confused, inaudible. And so awhile he stood. At length, In painful tones, that gathered strength With feeling's faster flow, he said: —“What would'st thou with me, fatal maid? That ever thus, by land and sea, Thy dangerous beauty follows me?”— She speaks in gentle accents low, While dim through tears her bright eyes move: —“Thou askest what thou well dost know; I love thee, and I seek thy love.”— —“My love! It sleeps in dust for ever Within my lost Calliroë's tomb: The smiles of living beauty never May my soul's darkness re-illume. We grew together, like twin flowers, Whose opening buds the same dews cherish; And one is reft, ere noon-tide hours, Violently; one remains, to perish By slow decay; as I remain Even now, to move and breathe in vain. The late, false love, that worldlings learn, When hearts are hard, and thoughts are stern, And feelings dull, and Custom's rule Omnipotent, that love may cool, And waste, and change: but this—which flings Round the young soul its tendril rings, Strengthening their growth and grasp with years, Till habits, pleasures, hopes, smiles, tears, All modes of thinking, feeling, seeing, Of two congenial spirits, blend In one inseparable being,— Deem'st thou this love can change or end? There is no eddy on the stream, No bough that light winds bend and toss, No chequering of the sunny beam Upon the woodland moss, No star in evening's sky, no flower Whose beauty odorous breezes stir, No sweet bird singing in the bower, Nay, not the rustling of a leaf, That does not nurse and feed my grief By wakening thoughts of her. All lovely things a place possessed Of love in my Calliroë's breast: And from her purer, gentler spirit, Did mine the love and joy inherit, Which that blest maid around her threw. With all I saw, and felt, and knew, The image of Calliroë grew, Till all the beauty of the earth Seemed as to her it owed its birth, And did but many forms express Of her reflected loveliness. The sunshine and the air seemed less The sources of my life: and how Was she torn from me? Earth is now A waste, where many echoes tell Only of her I loved—how well Words have no power to speak:—and thou— Gather the rose-leaves from the plain Where faded and defiled they lie, And close them in their bud again, And bid them to the morning sky Spread lovely as at first they were: Or from the oak the ivy tear, And wreathe it round another tree In vital growth: then turn to me, And bid my spirit cling on thee, As on my lost Calliroë!”— —“The Genii of the earth, and sea, And air, and fire, my mandates hear. Even the dread Power, thy Ladon's fear, Arcadian Dæmogorgon, “The dreaded name of Dæmogorgon” is familiar to every reader, in Milton's enumeration of the Powers of Chaos. Mythological writers in general afford but little information concerning this terrible Divinity. He is incidentally mentioned in several places by Natalis Comes, who says, in treating of Pan, that Pronapides, in his Protocosmus, makes Pan and the three sister Fates the offspring of Dæmogorgon. Boccaccio, in a Latin treatise on the Genealogy of the Gods, gives some account of him on the authority of Theodotion and Pronapides. He was the Genius of the Earth, and the Sovereign Power of the Terrestrial Dæmons. He dwelt originally with Eternity and Chaos, till, becoming weary of inaction, he organised the chaotic elements, and surrounded the earth with the heavens. In addition to Pan and the Fates, his children were Uranus, Titæa, Pytho, Eris, and Erebus. This awful Power was so sacred among the Arcadians, that it was held impious to pronounce his name. The impious, however, who made less scruple about pronouncing it, are said to have found it of great virtue in magical incantations. He has been supposed to be a philosophical emblem of the principle of vegetable life. The silence of mythologists concerning him, can only be attributed to their veneration for his “dreaded name”; a proof of genuine piety which must be pleasing to our contemporary Pagans, for some such there are. knows My voice: the ivy or the rose, Though torn and trampled on the plain, May rise, unite, and bloom again, If on his aid I call: thy heart Alone resists and mocks my art.”— —“Why lov'st thou me, Thessalian maid? Why hast thou, cruel beauty, torn Asunder two young hearts, that played In kindred unison so blest, As they had filled one single breast From life's first opening morn? Why lov'st thou me? The kings of earth Might kneel to charms and power like thine: But I, a youth of shepherd birth— As well the stately mountain-pine Might coil around the eglantine, As thou thy radiant being twine Round one so low, so lost as mine.”— —“Sceptres and crowns, vain signs that move The souls of slaves, to me are toys. I need but love: I seek but love: And long, amid the heartless noise Of cities, and the woodland peace Of vales, through all the scenes of Greece I sought the fondest and the fairest Of Grecian youths, my love to be: And such a heart and form thou bearest, And my soul sprang at once to thee, Like an arrow to its destiny. Yet shall my lips no spell repeat, To bid thy heart responsive beat To mine: thy love's spontaneous smile, Nor forced by power, nor won by guile, I claim: but yet a little while, And we no more may meet. For I must find a dreary home, And thou, where'er thou wilt, shalt roam: But should one tender thought awake Of Rhododaphne, seek the cell, Where she dissolved in tears doth dwell Of blighted hope, and she will take The wanderer to her breast, and make Such flowers of bliss around him blow, As kings would yield their thrones to know.”— —“It must not be. The air is laden With sweetness from thy presence born: Music and light are round thee, maiden, As round the Virgin Power of Morn: I feel, I shrink beneath, thy beauty: But love, truth, woe, remembrance, duty, All point against thee, though arrayed In charms whose power no heart could shun That ne'er had loved another maid Or any but that loveliest one, Who now, within my bosom's void, A sad pale shade, by thee destroyed, Forbids all other love to bind My soul: thine least of womankind.”— Faltering and faint his accents broke, As those concluding words he spoke. No more she said, but sadly smiled, And took his hand; and like a child He followed her. All waste and wild, A pathless moor before them lies. Beyond, long chains of mountains rise: Their summits with eternal snow Are crowned: vast forests wave below, And stretch, with ample slope and sweep, Down to the moorlands and the deep. Human dwelling see they none, Save one cottage, only one, Mossy, mildewed, frail, and poor, Even as human home can be, Where the forest skirts the moor, By the inhospitable sea. There, in tones of melody, Sweet and clear as Dian's voice When the rocks and woods rejoice In her steps the chace impelling, Rhododaphne, pausing, calls. Echo answers from the walls: Mournful response, vaguely telling Of a long-deserted dwelling. Twice her lips the call repeat, Tuneful summons, thrilling sweet. Still the same sad accents follow, Cheerless echo, faint and hollow. Nearer now, with curious gaze, The youth that lonely cot surveys. Long grass chokes the path before it, Twining ivy mantles o'er it, On the low roof blend together Beds of moss and stains of weather, Flowering weeds that trail and cluster, Scaly lichen, stone-crop's lustre, All confused in radiance mellow, Red, grey, green, and golden yellow. Idle splendor! gleaming only Over ruins rude and lonely, When the cold hearth-stone is shattered, When the ember-dust is scattered, When the grass that chokes the portal Bends not to the tread of mortal. The maiden dropped Anthemion's hand, And forward, with a sudden bound, She sprung. He saw the door expand, And close, and all was silence round, And loneliness: and forth again She came not. But within this hour, A burthen to him, and a chain, Had been her beauty and her power: But now, thus suddenly forsaken, In those drear solitudes, though yet His early love remained unshaken, He felt within his breast awaken A sense of something like regret. But he pursued her not: his love, His murdered love, such step forbade. He turned his doubtful feet, to rove Amid that forest's maze of shade. Beneath the matted boughs, that made A noonday twilight, he espied No trace of man; and far and wide Through fern and tangling briar he strayed, Till toil, and thirst, and hunger weighed His nature down, and cold and drear Night came, and no relief was near. But now at once his steps emerge Upon the forest's moorland verge, Beside the white and sounding surge. For in one long self-circling track, His mazy path had led him back, To where that cottage old and lone Had stood: but now to him unknown Was all the scene. Mid gardens, fair With trees and flowers of fragrance rare, A rich and ample pile was there, Glittering with myriad lights, that shone Far-streaming through the dusky air. With hunger, toil, and weariness, Outworn, he cannot choose but pass Tow'rds that fair pile. With gentle stress He strikes the gate of polished brass. Loud and long the portal rings, As back with swift recoil it swings, Disclosing wide a vaulted hall, With many columns bright and tall Encircled. Throned in order round, Statues of dæmons and of kings Between the marble columns frowned With seeming life: each throne beside, Two humbler statues stood, and raised Each one a silver lamp, that wide With many-mingling radiance blazed. High-reared on one surpassing throne, A brazen image sate alone, A dwarfish shape, of wrinkled brow, With sceptred hand and crowned head. No sooner did Anthemion's tread The echoes of the hall awake, Than up that image rose, and spake, As from a trumpet:—“What would'st thou?”— Anthemion, in amaze and dread, Replied:—“With toil and hunger worn, I seek but food, and rest till morn.”— The image spake again, and said: —“Enter: fear not: thou art free To my best hospitality.”— Spontaneously, an inner door Unclosed. Anthemion from the hall Passed to a room of state, that wore Aspect of destined festival. Of fragrant cedar was the floor, And round the light-pilastered wall Curtains of crimson and of gold Hung down in many a gorgeous fold. Bright lamps, through that apartment gay Adorned like Cytherëa's bowers With vases filled with odorous flowers, Diffused an artificial day. A banquet's sumptuous order there, In long array of viands rare, Fruits, and ambrosial wine, was spread. A golden boy, in semblance fair Of actual life, came forth, and led Anthemion to a couch, beside That festal table, canopied With cloth by subtlest Tyrian dyed, And ministered the feast: the while, Invisible harps symphonious wreathed Wild webs of soul-dissolving sound, And voices, alternating round, Songs, as of choral maidens, breathed. Now to the brim the boy filled up With sparkling wine a crystal cup. Anthemion took the cup, and quaffed, With reckless thirst, the enchanted draught. That instant came a voice divine, A maiden voice:—“Now art thou mine!”— The golden boy is gone. The song And the symphonious harps no more Their Siren minstrelsy prolong. One crimson curtain waves before His sight, and opens. From its screen, The nymph of more than earthly mien, The magic maid of Thessaly, Came forth, her tresses loosely streaming, Her eyes with dewy radiance beaming, Her form all grace and symmetry, In silken vesture light and free As if the woof were air, she came, And took his hand, and called his name. —“Now art thou mine!”—again she cried,— “My love's indissoluble chain Has found thee in that goblet's tide, And thou shalt wear my flower again.”— She said, and in Anthemion's breast She placed the laurel-rose: her arms She twined around him, and imprest Her lips on his, and fixed on him Fond looks of passionate love: her charms With tenfold radiance on his sense Shone through the studied negligence Of her light vesture. His eyes swim With dizziness. The lamps grow dim, And tremble, and expire. No more. Darkness is there, and Mystery: And Silence keeps the golden key Of Beauty's bridal door. Canto VII First, fairest, best, of powers supernal, Love waved in heaven his wings of gold, And from the depths of Night eternal, Black Erebus, and Chaos old, Bade light, and life, and beauty rise Harmonious from the dark disguise Of elemental discord wild, Which he had charmed and reconciled. Love first in social bonds combined The scattered tribes of humankind, And bade the wild race cease to roam, And learn the endearing name of home. From Love the sister arts began, That charm, adorn, and soften man. To Love the feast, the dance, belong, The temple-rite, the choral song; All feelings that refine and bless, All kindness, sweetness, gentleness. Him men adore, and gods admire, Of delicacy, grace, desire, Persuasion, bliss, the bounteous sire; In hopes, and toils, and pains, and fears, Sole dryer of our human tears; Chief ornament of heaven, and king Of earth, to whom the world doth sing One chorus of accordant pleasure, Of which he taught and leads the measure. He kindles in the inmost mind One lonely flame—for once—for one— A vestal fire, which, there enshrined, Lives on, till life itself be done. All other fires are of the earth, And transient: but of heavenly birth Is Love's first flame, which howsoever Fraud, power, woe, chance, or fate, may sever From its congenial source, must burn Unquenched, but in the funeral urn. And thus Anthemion knew and felt, As in that palace on the wild, By dæmon art adorned, he dwelt With that bright nymph, who ever smiled Refulgent as the summer morn On eastern ocean newly born. Though oft, in Rhododaphne's sight, A phrensied feeling of delight, With painful admiration mixed Of her surpassing beauty, came Upon him, yet of earthly flame That passion was. Even as betwixt The night-clouds transient lightnings play, Those feelings came and passed away, And left him lorn. Calliroë ever Pursued him like a bleeding shade, Nor all the magic nymph's endeavour Could from his constant memory sever The image of that dearer maid. Yet all that love and art could do The enchantress did. The pirate-crew Her power had snatched from death, and pent Awhile in ocean's bordering caves, To be her ministers and slaves: And there, by murmured spells, she sent On all their shapes phantastic change. In many an uncouth form and strange, Grim dwarf, or bony Æthiop tall, They plied, throughout the enchanted hall, Their servile ministries, or sate Gigantic mastiffs in the gate, Or stalked around the garden-dells In lion-guise, gaunt centinels. And many blooming youths and maids, A joyous Bacchanalian train, (That mid the rocks and piny shades Of mountains, through whose wild domain Œagrian Hebrus, swift and cold, Impels his waves o'er sands of gold, Their orgies led) by secret force Of her far-scattered spells compelled, With song, and dance, and shout, their course Tow'rds that enchanted dwelling held. Oft, mid those palace-gardens fair, The beauteous nymph (her radiant hair With mingled oak and vine-leaves crowned) Would grasp the thyrsus ivy-bound, And fold, her festal vest around, The Bacchic nebris, leading thus The swift and dizzy thiasus: And as she moves, in all her charms, With springing feet and flowing arms, 'Tis strange in one fair shape to see How many forms of grace can be. The youths and maids, her beauteous train, Follow fast in sportive ring, Some the torch and mystic cane, Some the vine-bough, brandishing; Some, in giddy circlets fleeting, The Corybantic timbrel beating: Maids, with silver flasks advancing, Pour the wine's red-sparkling tide, Which youths, with heads recumbent dancing, Catch in goblets as they glide: All upon the odorous air Lightly toss their leafy hair, Ever singing, as they move, —“Io Bacchus! son of Jove!”— And oft, the Bacchic fervors ending, Among those garden-bowers they stray, Dispersed, where fragrant branches blending Exclude the sun's meridian ray, Or on some thymy bank repose, By which a tinkling rivulet flows, Where birds, on each o'ershadowing spray, Make music through the live-long day. The while, in one sequestered cave, Where roses round the entrance wave, And jasmin sweet and clustering vine With flowers and grapes the arch o'ertwine, Anthemion and the nymph recline, While in the sunny space, before The cave, a fountain's lucid store Its crystal column shoots on high, And bursts, like showery diamonds flashing, So falls, and with melodious dashing Shakes the small pool. A youth stands by, A tuneful rhapsodist, and sings, Accordant to his changeful strings, High strains of ancient poesy. And oft her golden lyre she takes, And such transcendent strains awakes, Such floods of melody, as steep Anthemion's sense in bondage deep Of passionate admiration: still Combining with intenser skill The charm that holds him now, whose bands May ne'er be loosed by mortal hands. And oft they rouse with clamorous chace The forest, urging wide and far Through glades and dells the sylvan war. Satyrs and Fauns would start around, And through their ferny dingles bound, To see that nymph, all life and grace And radiance, like the huntress-queen, With sandaled feet and vest of green, In her soft fingers grasp the spear, Hang on the track of flying deer, Shout to the dogs as fast they sweep Tumultuous down the woodland steep, And hurl, along the tainted air, The javelin from her streaming hair. The bath, the dance, the feast's array, And sweetest rest, conclude the day. And 'twere most witching to disclose, Were there such power in mortal numbers, How she would charm him to repose, And gaze upon his troubled slumbers, With looks of fonder love, than ever Pale Cynthia on Endymion cast, While her forsaken chariot passed O'er Caria's many-winding river. The love she bore him was a flame So strong, so total, so intense, That no desire beside might claim Dominion in her thought or sense. The world had nothing to bestow On her: for wealth and power were hers: The dæmons of the earth (that know The beds of gems and fountain-springs Of undiscovered gold, and where, In subterranean sepulchres The memory of whose place doth bear No vestige, long-forgotten kings Sit gaunt on monumental thrones, With massy pearls and costly stones Hanging on their half-mouldered bones) Were slaves to her. The fears and cares Of feebler mortals—Want, and Woe His daughter, and their mutual child Remorseless Crime,—keen Wrath, that tears The breast of Hate unreconciled,— Ambition's spectral goad,—Revenge, That finds in consummation food To nurse anew her hydra brood,— Shame, Misery's sister,—dread of change, The bane of wealth and worldly might,— She knew not: Love alone, like ocean, Filled up with one unshared emotion Her soul's capacity: but right And wrong she recked not of, nor owned A law beyond her soul's desire; And from the hour that first enthroned Anthemion in her heart, the fire, That burned within her, like the force Of floods swept with it in its course All feelings that might barriers prove To her illimitable love. Thus, wreathed with ever-varying flowers, Went by the purple-pinioned hours; Till once, returning from the wood And woodland chace, at evening-fall, Anthemion and the enchantress stood Within the many-columned hall, Alone. They looked around them. Where Are all those youths and maidens fair, Who followed them but now? On high She waves her lyre. Its murmurs die Tremulous. They come not whom she calls. Why starts she? Wherefore does she throw Around the youth her arms of snow, With passion so intense, and weep? What mean those murmurs, sad and low, That like sepulchral echoes creep Along the marble walls? Her breath is short and quick; and, dim With tears, her eyes are fixed on him: Her lips are quivering and apart: He feels the fluttering of her heart: Her face is pale. He cannot shun Her fear's contagion. Tenderly He kissed her lips in sympathy, And said:—“What ails thee, lovely one?”— Low, trembling, faint, her accents fall: —“Look round: what seest thou in the hall?”— Anthemion looked, and made return: —“The statues, and the lamps that burn: No more.”—“Yet look again, where late The solitary image sate, The monarch-dwarf. Dost thou not see An image there which should not be?”— Even as she bade he looked again: From his high throne the dwarf was gone. Lo! there, as in the Thespian fane, Uranian Love! His bow was bent: The arrow to its head was drawn: His frowning brow was fixed intent On Rhododaphne. Scarce did rest Upon that form Anthemion's view, When, sounding shrill, the arrow flew, And lodged in Rhododaphne's breast. It was not Love's own shaft, the giver Of life and joy and tender flame; But, borrowed from Apollo's quiver, The death-directed arrow came. Long, slow, distinct in each stern word, A sweet deep-thrilling voice was heard: —“With impious spells hast thou profaned My altars; and all-ruling Jove, Though late, yet certain, has unchained The vengeance of Uranian Love! The late but certain vengeance of the gods, occurs in many forms as a sentence among the classical writers; and is the subject of an interesting dialogue, among the moral works of Plutarch, which concludes with the fable of Thespesius, a very remarkable prototype of the Inferno of Dante.”— The marble palace burst asunder, Riven by subterranean thunder. Sudden clouds around them rolled, Lucid vapour, fold on fold. Then Rhododaphne closer prest Anthemion to her bleeding breast, As, in his arms upheld, her head All languid on his neck reclined; And in the curls, that overspread His cheek, her temple-ringlets twined: Her dim eyes drew, with fading sight, From his their last reflected light, And on his lips, as nature failed, Her lips their last sweet sighs exhaled. —“Farewell!”—she said—“another bride The partner of thy days must be: But do not hate my memory: And build a tomb, by Ladon's tide, To her, who, false in all beside, Was but too true in loving thee!”— The quivering earth beneath them stirred. In dizzy trance upon her bosom He fell, as falls a wounded bird Upon a broken rose's blossom. What sounds are in Anthemion's ear? It is the lark that carols clear, And gentle waters murmuring near. He lifts his head: the new-born day Is round him, and the sun-beams play On silver eddies. Can it be? The stream he loved in infancy? The hills? the Aphrodisian grove? The fields that knew Calliroë's love? And those two sister trees, are they The cedar and the poplar grey, That shade old Pheidon's door? Alas! Sad vision now! Does Phantasy Play with his troubled sense, made dull By many griefs? He does not dream: It is his own Arcadian stream, The fields, the hills: and on the grass, The dewy grass of Ladon's vale, Lies Rhododaphne, cold and pale, But even in death most beautiful; And there, in mournful silence by her, Lies on the ground her golden lyre. He knelt beside her on the ground: On her pale face and radiant hair He fixed his eyes, in sorrow drowned. That one so gifted and so fair, All light and music, thus should be Quenched like a night-star suddenly, Might move a stranger's tears; but he Had known her love; such love, as yet Never could heart that knew forget! He thought not of his wrongs. Alone Her love and loveliness possest His memory, and her fond cares, shewn In seeking, nature's empire through, Devices ever rare and new, To make him calm and blest. Two maids had loved him; one, the light Of his young soul, the morning star Of life and love; the other, bright As are the noon-tide skies, when far The vertic sun's fierce radiance burns: The world had been too brief to prove The measure of each single love: Yet, from this hour, forlorn, bereft, Companionless, where'er he turns, Of all that love on earth is left No trace but their cinereal urns. But Pheidon's door unfolds; and who Comes forth in beauty? Oh! 'tis she, Herself, his own Calliroë! And in that burst of blest surprise, Like Lethe's self upon his brain Oblivion of all grief and pain Descends, and tow'rds her path he flies. The maiden knew Her love, and flew To meet him, and her dear arms threw Around his neck, and wept for bliss, And on his lips impressed a kiss He had not dared to give. The spell Was broken now, that gave before Not death, but magic slumber. More The closing measure needs not tell. Love, wonder, transport wild and high, Question that waited not reply, And answer unrequired, and smiles Through such sweet tears as bliss beguiles, Fixed, mutual looks of long delight, Soft chiding for o'erhasty flight, And promise never more to roam, Were theirs. Old Pheidon from his home Came forth, to share their joy, and bless Their love, and all was happiness. But when the maid Anthemion led To where her beauteous rival slept The long last sleep, on earth dispread, And told her tale, Calliroë wept Sweet tears for Rhododaphne's doom; For in her heart a voice was heard: —“'Twas for Anthemion's love she erred!”— They built by Ladon's banks a tomb; And, when the funeral pyre had burned, With seemly rites they there inurned The ashes of the enchantress fair; And sad sweet verse they traced, to show That youth, love, beauty, slept below; And bade the votive marble bear The name of Rhododaphne. There The laurel-rose luxuriant sprung, And in its boughs her lyre they hung, And often, when, at evening hours, They decked the tomb with mournful flowers, The lyre upon the twilight breeze Would pour mysterious symphonies.

The Country banks are breaking: The London banks are shaking: Suspicion is awaking: E'en quakers now are quaking: Experience seems to settle, That paper is not metal, And promises of payment Are neither food nor raiment; Then, since that, one and all, you Are fellows of no value For genius, learning, spirit, Or any kind of merit That mortals call substantial, Excepting the financial, (Which means the art of robbing By huckstering and jobbing, And sharing gulls and gudgeons Among muckworms and curmudgeons) Being each a flimsy funny On the stream of paper money, All riding by sheet anchors, Of balances at Bankers; Look out! for squalls are coming, That if you stand hum-drumming, Will burst with vengeance speedy, And leave you like the needy Who have felt your clutches greedy, All beggarly and seedy And not worth a maravedi. Chorus. Our balances, our balances, Our balances, our balances: Our balances we crave for: Our balances we rave for: Our balances we rush for: Our balances we crush for: Our balances we call for: Our balances we bawl for: Our balances we run for: Our balances we dun for: Our balances we pour for: Our balances we roar for: Our balances we shout for: Our balances we rout for: Our balances, our balances, We bellow all about for. Obadiah Nine-eyes. The mighty men of Gad, yea,The Nine-eyes or Lamprey is distinguished for its power of suction. Are all upon the pad, yea, Bellowing with lungs all brazen, Even like the bulls of Basan; With carnal noise and shout, yea, They compass me about, yea; I am full of tribulation For the sinful generation; I shrink from the abiding Of the wrath of their back-sliding; Lest my feet should be up-tripp-ed, And my outward man be stripp-ed, And my pockets be out-clean-ed Of the fruits which I have glean-ed.

THE THREE LITTLE MEN “Base is the slave that pays.” —Pistol. There were Three Little Men, And they made a Little Pen, And they said, “Little Pen, you must flow, flow, flow, And write our names away Under promises to pay, Which how we are to keep we do not know.” Then said the Little Pen:— “My pretty Little Men, If you wish your pretty promises to pass, pass, pass, You must make a little flash, And parade a little cash, And you're sure of every neighbour that's an ass, ass, ass.” Then said the Little Three, “If wiseacres there be, They are not the sort of folks for me, me, me. Let us have but all the fools, And the wise ones and their rules May just go to the devil and be d?, d?, d?.” Then the Little Men so gay, Wrote their promises to pay, And lived for many moons royally, ly, ly, Till there came a stormy day, And they vanished all away, Leaving many shoals of gudgeons high and dry, dry, dry. They who sought the Little Men, Only found the Little Pen, Which they instantly proceeded to condemn, demn, demn; “But,” said the Little Pen, “Use me like the Little Men, And I'll make you as good money as I made for them.” The seekers with long faces, Returned upon their traces, They carried in the van the Little Pen, Pen, Pen; And they hung it on the wall Of their reverend Town-hall, As an eloquent memorial of the Little Men. PROŒMIUM OF AN EPIC WHICH WILL SHORTLY APPEAR IN QUARTO, UNDER THE TITLE OF “FLY-BY-NIGHT,” By R? S?, Esq., Poet Laureate. “His promises were, as he once was, mighty; And his performance, as he is now, nothing.” Hen. VIII. How troublesome is day! It calls us from our sleep away; It bids us from our pleasant dreams awake, And sends us forth to keep or break Our promises to pay. How troublesome is day! Now listen to my lay; Much have I said, Which few have heard or read, And much have I to say, Which hear ye while ye may. Come listen to my lay, Come, for ye know me, as a man Who always praises, as he can, All promisers to pay. So they and I on terms agree, And they but keep their faith with me, Whate'er their deeds to others be, They may to the minutest particle Command my fingers for an ode or article. Come listen while I strike the Epic string, And, as a changeful song I sing, Before my eyes Bid changeful Proteus rise, Turning his coat and skin in countless forms and dyes. Come listen to my lay, While I the wild and wondrous tale array, How Fly-by-Night went down, And set a bank up in a country town; How like a king his head he reared; And how the Coast of Cash he cleared; And how one night he disappeared, When many a scoffer jibed and jeered; And many an old man rent his beard; And many a young man cursed and railed; And many a woman wept and wailed; And many a mighty heart was quailed; And many a wretch was caged and gaoled: Because great Fly-by-Night had failed. And many a miserable sinner Went without his Sunday dinner, Because he had not metal bright, And waved in vain before the butcher's sight, The promises of Fly-by-Night. And little Jackey Horner Sate sulking in the corner, And in default of Christmas pie Whereon his little thumb to try, He put his finger in his eye, And blubbered long and lustily. Come listen to my lay, And ye shall say, That never tale of errant knight, Or captive damsel bright, Demon, or elf, or goblin sprite, Fierce crusade, or feudal fight, Or cloistral phantom all in white, Or castle on accessless height, Upreared by necromantic might, Was half so full of rare delight, As this whereof I now prolong, The memory in immortal song— The wild and wondrous tale of Fly-by-Night. A MOOD OF MY OWN MIND, OCCURRING DURING A GALE OF WIND AT MIDNIGHT, WHILE I WAS WRITING A PAPER ON THE CURRENCY, BY THE LIGHT OF TWO MOULD CANDLES. By W. W., Esq., Distributor of Stamps. “Quid distent æra lupinis?” —Hor. Much grieved am I in spirit by the news of this day's post, Which tells me of the devil to pay with the paper money host: 'Tis feared that out of all their mass of promises to pay, The devil alone will get his due: he'll take them at his day. I have a pleasant little nook secured from colds and damps, From whence to paper money men I serve out many stamps; From thence a fair percentage gilds my dwelling in the glen; And therefore do I sympathise with the paper money men. I muse, I muse, for much this news my spirit doth perplex, But whilst I muse I can't refuse a pint of double X, Which Mrs. W. brings to me, which she herself did brew, Oh! doubly sweet is double X from Mistress double U. The storm is on the mountain side, the wind is all around; It sweeps across the lake and vale, it makes a mighty sound: A rushing sound, that makes me think of what I've heard at sea, “The devil in a gale of wind is as busy as a bee.” I fear the devil is busy now with the paper money men: I listen to the tempest's roar through mountain pass and glen; I hear amid the eddying blast a sound among the hills, Which to my fancy seems the sound of bursting paper mills. A money-grinding paper mill blows up with such a sound, As shakes the green geese from their nests for many miles around; Oh woe to him who seeks the mill pronouncing sternly “Pay!” A spell like “open sesame” which evil sprites obey. The word of power up-blows the mill, the miller disappears: The shattered fragments fall in showers about the intruder's ears; And leave no trace to mark the place of what appeared so great, But shreds of rags, and ends of quills, and bits of copper-plate. I love the paper money, and the paper money men; My hundred, if they go to pot, I fear would sink to ten; The country squires would cry “Retrench!” and then I might no doubt, Be sent about my business; yea, even right about. I hold the paper money men say truly, when they say They ought to pay their promises, with promises to pay; And he is an unrighteous judge, who says they shall or may, Be made to keep their promises in any other way. The paper money goes about, by one, and two, and five, A circulation like the blood, that keeps the land alive: It pays the rent of country squires, and makes them think they thrive, When else they might be lighting fires to smoke the loyal hive. The paper money goes about: it works extremely well: I find it buys me every thing that people have to sell: Bread, beef, and breeches, coals and wine, and all good things in store, The paper money buys for me: and what could gold do more? The promise works extremely well, so that it be but broken: 'Tis not a promise to be kept, but a solemn type and token, A type of value gone abroad on travel long ago; And how it's to come back again, God knows, I do not know. If ignorant impatience makes the people run for gold, Whatever's left that paper bought must be put up and sold; If so, perhaps they'll put up me as a purchase of the Crown; I fear I shan't fetch sixpence, but I'm sure to be knock'd down. The promise is not to be kept, that point is very clear; 'Twas proved so by a Scotch adept who dined with me last year, I wish instead of viands rare, which were but thrown away, I had dined him on a bill of fare, to be eaten at Doomsday. God save the paper money and the paper money men! God save them all from those who call to have their gold again; God send they may be always safe against a reckoning day; And then, God send me plenty of their promises to pay! LOVE AND THE FLIMSIES By T. M., Esq. ? ?? ????, ?????? ????? ?(??? ??????? ???????. —Anacr. Little Cupid one day on a sunbeam was floating, Above a green vale where a paper-mill played; And he hovered in ether, delightedly noting The whirl and the splash that the water-wheel made. The air was all filled with the scent of the roses, Round the miller's viranda that clustered and twined; And he thought if the sky were all made up of noses, This spot of the earth would be most to its mind. And forth came the miller, a quaker in verity, Rigid of limb and complacent of face, And behind him a Scotchman was singing “Prosperity,” And picking his pocket with infinite grace. And “Walth and prosparity,” “Walth and prosparity,” His bonny Scotch burthen arose on the air, To a song all in praise of that primitive charity, Which begins with sweet home and which terminates there. But sudden a tumult arose from a distance, And in rushed a rabble with steel and with stone, And ere the scared miller could call for assistance, The mill to a million of atoms was blown. Scarce mounted the fragments in ether to hurtle, When the quaker was vanished no eye had seen where; And the Scotchman thrown flat on his back like a turtle, Was sprawling and bawling with heels in the air. Little Cupid continued to hover and flutter, Pursuing the fragments that floated on high, As light as the fly that is christened from butter, Till he gathered his handsfull and flew to the sky. “Oh mother,” he cried, as he shewed them to Venus, “What are these little talismans cyphered—One—One? If you think them worth having we'll share them between us, Though their smell is like, none of the newest, poor John.” “My darling,” says Venus, “away from you throw them, They're a sort of fool's gold among mortals 'tis true; But we want them not here, though I think you might know them, Since on earth they so often have bought and sold you.” THE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM By S. T. C., Esq., Professor of Mysticism. ????? ????. —Pindar. In a bowl to sea went wise men three, On a brilliant night of June: They carried a net, and their hearts were set On fishing up the moon. The sea was calm, the air was balm, Not a breath stirred low or high, And the moon, I trow, lay as bright below, And as round as in the sky. The wise men with the current went, Nor paddle nor oar had they, And still as the grave they went on the wave, That they might not disturb their prey. Far, far at sea, were the wise men three, When their fishing net they threw; And at the throw, the moon below In a thousand fragments flew. The sea was bright with the dancing light Of a million million gleams, Which the broken moon shot forth as soon As the net disturbed her beams. They drew in their net: it was empty and wet, And they had lost their pain, Soon ceased the play of each dancing ray, And the image was round again. Three times they threw, three times they drew, And all the while were mute; And ever anew their wonder grew, Till they could not but dispute. Their silence they broke, and each one spoke Full long, and loud, and clear; A man at sea their voices three Full three leagues off might hear. The three wise men got home again To their children and their wives: But touching their trip, and their net's vain dip, They disputed all their lives. The wise men three could never agree, Why they missed the promised boon; They agreed alone that their net they had thrown, And they had not caught the moon. I have thought myself pale o'er this ancient tale, And its sense I could not ken; But now I see that the wise men three Were paper-money men. “Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub,” Is a mystic burthen old, Which I've pondered about till my fire went out, And I could not sleep for cold. I now divine each mystic sign, Which robbed me oft of sleep, Three men in a bowl, who went to troll, For the moon in the midnight deep. Three men were they who science drank From Scottish fountains free; The cash they sank in the Gotham bank, Was the moon beneath the sea. The breaking of the imaged moon, At the fishing-net's first splash, Was the breaking of the bank as soon As the wise men claimed their cash. The dispute which lasted all their lives, Was the economic strife, Which the son's son's son of every one Will maintain through all his life. The son's son's sons will baffled be, As were their sires of old; But they'll only agree, like the wise men three, That they could not get their gold. And they'll build systems dark and deep, And systems broad and high; But two of three will never agree About the reason why. And he who at this day will seek The Economic Club, Will find at least three sages there, As ready as any that ever were To go to sea in a tub. CHORUS OF BUBBLE BUYERS “When these practisers come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff, puff, and all flies in fumo. Poor wretches! I rather pity their folly and indiscretion, than their loss of time and money: for these may be restored by industry: but to be a fool born is a disease incurable.” Ben Jonson's Volpone. Oh! where are the hopes we have met in a morning, As we hustled and bustled around Capel Court? When we laughed at the croakers that bade us take warning, Who once were our scorn and now make us their sport. Oh! where are the regions where well-paid inspectors Found metals omnigenous streaked and emboss'd? So kindly bought for us by honest directors, Who charged us but three times as much as they cost. Oh! where are the riches that bubbled like fountains, In places we neither could utter nor spell, A thousand miles inland mid untrodden mountains, Where silver and gold grew like heath and blue-bell? Oh! where are the lakes overflowing with treasure? The gold-dust that rolled in each torrent and stream? The mines that held water by cubic-mile measure, So easily pumped up by portable steam? That water our prospects a damp could not throw on; We had only a million-horse power to prepare, Make a thousand-mile road for the engine to go on, And send coals from Newcastle to boil it when there. Oh! where are the bridges to span the Atlantic? Oh! where is the gas to illumine the poles? They came to our visions; that makes us half frantic: They came to our pockets; that touches our souls. Oh! there is the seat of most exquisite feeling: The first pair of nerves to the pocket doth dive: A wound in our hearts would be no time in healing, But a wound in our pockets how can we survive? Now curst be the projects, and curst the projectors, And curst be the bubbles before us that rolled, Which, bursting, have left us like desolate spectres, Bewailing our bodies of paper and gold. For what is a man but his coat and his breeches, His plate and his linen, his land and his house? Oh! we had been men had we won our mock riches, But now we are ghosts, each as poor as a mouse. But shades as we are, we, with shadowy bubbles, When the midnight bell tolls will through Capel Court glide, And the dream of the Jew shall be turmoils and troubles, When he sees each pale ghost on its bubble astride. And the lecturing Scots that upheld the delusion, By prating of paper, and wealth, and free trade, Shall see us by night to their awe and confusion, Grim phantoms of wrath that shall never be laid. A BORDER BALLAD BY AN ENCHANTER UNKNOWN “The Scot, to rival realms a mighty bar, Here fixed his mountain home: a wide domain, And rich the soil, had purple heath been grain: But what the niggard ground of wealth denied, From fields more blest his fearless arm supplied.” Leyden. The Scotts, Kerrs, and Murrays, and Deloraines all, The Hughies o' Hawdon, and Wills-o'-the-Wall, The Willimondswicks, and the hard-riding Dicks, Are stanch to the last to their old border tricks; Wine flows not from heath, and bread grinds not from stone, They must reeve for their living, or life they'll have none. When the Southron's strong arm, with the steel and the law, Had tamed the Moss-troopers, so bonny and braw; Though spiders wove webs in the rusty sword-hilt, In the niche of the hall which their forefathers built; Yet with sly paper credit and promise to pay, They still drove the trade which the wise call convey. Steal! odious is the word—convey the wise it call. Pistol. They whitewashed the front of their old border fort; They widened its loop-holes, and opened its court; They put in sash-windows where none were before, And they wrote the word “Bank” o'er the new-painted door; The cross-bow and matchlock aside they did lay, And they shot the stout Southron with promise to pay. They shot him from far and they shot him from near, And they laid him as flat as their fathers laid deer: Their fathers were heroes, though some called them thieves When they ransacked their dwellings and drove off their beeves; But craft undermined what force battered in vain, And the pride of the Southron was stretched on the plain. Now joy to the Hughies and Willies so bold! The Southron, like Dickon, is bought and is sold; To his goods and his chattels, his house and his land, Their promise to pay is as Harlequin's wand: A touch and a word, and pass, presto, begone, The Southron has lost and the Willies have won. The Hughies and Willies may lead a glad life: They reap without sowing, they win without strife: The Bruce and the Wallace were sturdy and fierce, But where Scotch steel was broken Scotch paper can pierce; And the true meed of conquest our minstrels shall fix, On the promise to pay of our Willimondswicks. ST. PETER OF SCOTLAND “Si bene calculum ponas, ubique naufragium est.” Petronius Arbiter. St. Peter of Scotland set sail with a crew Of philosophers picked from the Bluecap Review: His boat was of paper, old rags were her freight, And her bottom was sheathed with a spruce copperplate. Her mast was a quill, and to catch the fair gale The broad grey goose feather was spread for a sail; So he ploughed his blithe way through the surge and the spray, And the name of his boat was the Promise-to-Pay. And swiftly and gaily she went on her track, As if she could never be taken a-back, As if in her progress there never could be A chop of the wind or a swell of the sea. She was but a fair-weather vessel, in sooth, For winds that were gentle, and waves that were smooth; She was built not for storm, she was armed not for strife, But in her St. Peter risked fortune and life. His fortune, 'tis true, was but bundles of rag, That no pedlar, not Scotch, would have put in his bag; The worth of his life none could know but the few Who insured it on sailing from sweet Edinbroo'. St. Peter seemed daft, and he laughed and he quaffed; But an ill-boding wave struck his vessel right aft: It stove in his quarters and swamped his frail boat, Which sunk with an eddy and left him afloat. He clung to his goose-quill and floated all night, And he landed at daybreak in pitiful plight; And he preached a discourse when he reached the good town, To prove that his vessel should not have gone down. The nautical science he took for his guide Allowed no such force as the wind or the tide: None but blockheads could think such a science o'erthrown, By the breath of a gale which ought not to have blown. LAMENT OF SCOTCH ECONOMISTS ON THE EXTINCTION OF THE ONE-POUND NOTES “Do not halloo before you are out of the wood.” Castlereagh, of blessed memory. Oh hone-a-rie! Oh hone-a-rie! The pride of paper's reign is o'er, And fall'n the flower of credit's tree: We ne'er shall see a flimsy more. Oh! sprung from great I-will-not-pay, The chief that never feared a dun, How hopeful was thy ne'er-come-day, How comely thy symbolic One! The country loons with wonder saw The magic type perform its rounds, Transforming many a man of straw To men of many thousand pounds. For northern lads blithe days were those; They wanted neither beef nor ale, Surprised their toes with shoes and hose, And made Scotch broo' of English cail. Oh! Johnny Groat, we little thought, Tow'rds thee our noses e'er would point; But flimsies burned, and cash returned, Will put said noses out of joint. Improvements vast will then be past: The march of mind will backward lead; For how can mind be left behind, When we march back across the Tweed? Scotch logic floats on one-pound notes: When rags are cash our shirts are ore: What else would go to scare the crow, Becomes a myriad pounds and more. A scarecrow's suit would furnish forth A good Scotch bank's whole stock in trade: The wig, for coinage nothing worth, Might “surplus capital” be made. Oh! happy land, by Scotchmen taught! Thy fate was then indeed divine, When every scarecrow's pole was thought A true Real del Monte mine. Oh mystic One, that turned out None, When senseless panic pressed thee hard! Who thee could hold and call out “Gold!” Would he had feathered been and tarred. Thy little fly-wheel kept in play The mighty money-grinding mill; When thou art rashly torn away, The whole machine will stand stock still. The host of promisers to pay That fill their jugs on credit's hill, Will each roll down and crack his crown, As certainly as Jack and Jill. And we, God knows, may doff our hose And sell our shoes for what they're worth, And trudge again with naked toes Back to our land of Nod, the north. For, should we strain our lecturing throats, We might to walls and doors discuss: When John Bull sees through one-pound notes, 'Tis very clear he'll see through us. That rare hotch-potch, the College Scotch, Reared by our art in London town, Will be at best a standing jest, At least until it tumbles down. Of those day-dreams, our free-trade schemes, That laid in sippets goslings green, The world will think less brain than drink In skulls that hatched them must have been. Then farewell shirts, and breeks, and coats, Cloth, linen, cambric, silk, and lawn! Farewell! with you, dear one-pound notes, Mac Banquo's occupation's gone. The man who thrives with tens and fives Must have some coin, and none have we! Roast beef adieu! come barley broo'! Oh hone-a-rie! Oh hone-a-rie! CALEDONIAN WAR WHOOP “By the Coat of our House, which is an ass rampant, I am ready to fight under this banner.” Shadwell's Humourists. Chorus of Writers to The Signet. I Eh laird! Eh laird! an' ha' ye haird, That we're to hae nae ae poond nots? Ye weel may say the Hooses tway Wad play the de'il wi' a' the Scots. Ha' they nae fears when Scotland's tears Flow fast as ony burnie, oh! But they shall find we've a' one mind, The mind of one attorney, oh! II De'il take us a' if we can ca' To mind the day wherein we got The idle croons o' seely loons In ony medium but a not. De'il take us as we hop to be Wi' spoils o' clients bonny, oh! If e'er we look to touch a fee When there's nae paper money, oh! Solo—Sir Malachi Malagrowther. III Quoth Hudibras—Friend Ralph, thou hast (Hunt's blacking shines on Hyde park wall) Outrun the Constable at last, For gold will still be lord of all. The ups and downs of paper poun's Have made the English weary, oh! And 'tis their will old Scotland's mill Shall e'en gae Tapsalteerie, oh! IV Old Scotland brags, she kens of rags Far more than all the world beside: Her ancient mint with naught else in't, Is all her wealth, and power, and pride. Her ancient flag is all a rag, So oft in battle bloody, oh! Now well I think her blood is ink, And rags her soul and body, oh! V Beneath that rag, our ancient flag, We'll draw for rags our old claymore: Our arrows still, with gray goose quill Well fledged and tipped, in showers we'll pour: Our ink we'll shed, both black and red, In strokes, and points, and dashes, oh! Ere laws purloin our native coin, And turn it all to ashes, oh! VI The poorest rats of all the earth, Were ragged Scots in days of yore, Till paper coining's happy birth, Made cash of all the rags they wore; Though but the shade of smoke, 'tis plain, Said cash is Scotland's glory, oh! To make it real rags again Would be a tragic story, oh! VII What Scot would tack in herring smack, His living from the deep to snatch, Without a ragman at his back To take percentage on his catch? Who thinks that gold a place would hold On Scotland's soil a minute, oh! Unless of rag we make a bag That's full with nothing in it, oh! VIII Our Charley lad we bought and sold, But we've no Charley now to sell: Unless the De'il should rain up gold, Where Scots can get it, who can tell? The English loons have silver spoons, And golden watches bonnie, oh! But we'll have nought that's worth a groat, Without our paper money, oh! Grand Chorus of Scotchmen. Then up claymore and down with gun, And up with promises to pay, And down with every Saxon's son, That threatens us with reckoning day. To promise aye, and never pay, We've sworn by Scotland's fiddle, oh! Who calls a Scot “to cash his not” We'll cut him through the middle, oh!

There's nothing so bonny As Scotch paper money, Now dance away, Johnny—Oho! Oho! YE KITE-FLYERS OF SCOTLAND By T. C. “Quel ch'io vi debbo posso di parole Pagare in parte, e d'opera d'inchiostro.” Ariosto. Ye kite-flyers of Scotland, Who live from home at ease; Who raise the wind, from year to year, In a long and strong trade breeze: Your paper-kites let loose again On all the winds that blow; Though the shout of the rout Lay the English ragmen low; Though the shout for gold be fierce and bold, And the English ragmen low. The spirits of your fathers Shall peep from every leaf; For the midnight was their noon of fame, And their prize was living beef. Where Deloraine on Musgrave fell, Your paper kites shall show, That a way to convey Better far than theirs you know, When you launch your kites upon the wind And raise the wind to blow. Caledonia needs no bullion, No coin in iron case; Her treasure is a bunch of rags And the brass upon her face; With pellets from her paper mills She makes the Southrons trow, That to pay her sole way Is by promising to owe, By making promises to pay When she only means to owe. The meteor rag of Scotland Shall float aloft like scum, Till credit's o'erstrained line shall crack, And the day of reckoning come: Then, then, ye Scottish kite-flyers, Your hone-a-rie must flow, While you drink your own ink With your old friend Nick below, While you burn your bills and singe your quills In his bonny fire below. CHORUS OF NORTHUMBRIANS ON THE PROHIBITION OF SCOTCH ONE-POUND NOTES IN ENGLAND. March, March, Make-rags of Borrowdale, Not the Cumberland Borrodaile, but the genuine ancient name of that district of Scotland, whatever it be called now, from which was issued the first promise-to-pay, that was made with the express purpose of being broken. Whether ye promise to bearer or order; March, march, Take-rag and Bawbee-tail, Scoticé for Tag-rag and Bob-tail: “a highly respectable old firm.” A paper kite with a bawbee at its tail is perhaps a better emblem of the safe and economical currency of Scotland than Mr. Canning's mountain of paper irrigated by a rivulet of gold. All the Scotch flimsies must over the border: Vainly you snarl anent New Act of Parliament, Bidding you vanish from dairy and “laurder;” Scoticé for larder. Dogs, you have had your day, Down tail and slink away; You'll pick no more bones on this side of the border. Hence to the hills where your fathers stole cattle; Hence to the glens where they skulked from the law; Hence to the moors where they vanished from battle, Crying, “De'il tak the hindmost,” and “Charlie's awa'.” Metal is clanking here; Off with your banking gear; Off, ere you're paid “to Old Harry or order:” England shall many a day Wish you'd been far away, Long ere your kite's-wings flew over the border. March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale, Pay-the word, lads, and gold is the law, March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale; Tagdale, and Ragdale, and Bobdale, and a': Person or purse, they say; Purse you have none to pay; Your persons who'll deal with, except the Recorder? Yet, to retrieve your freaks, You can just leave your breeks; You'll want them no more when you're over the border. High on a pole in the vernal sun's baskings, When April has summoned your ragships away, We'll hoist up a pair of your best galligaskins, Entwined with young thistles to usher in May; Types of Scotch “copital,” They shall o'ertop-it-all, Stripped off from bearer and brushed into order; Then if you tarry, rogues, Nettles you'll get for brogues, And to the Rogue's March be drummed o'er the border. MARGERY DAW “Agite: inspicite: aurum est. Profecto, spectatores, Comicum. Verum ad hanc rem agundam Philippum est.” Plautus in Pœnulo. Chorus of Paper Money Makers. See-saw, Margery Daw, Spent all her gold and made money of straw. Margery Daw was our prototype fair: She built the first bank ever heard of: Her treasury ripened and dried in the air, And governments hung on the word of Margery Daw, Margery Daw, Who spent all her gold and made money of straw. Mother Goose was a blue of exceeding éclat, She wielded a pen, not a thimble: She made a fine ode about Margery Daw, Which was but a mystical symbol: “See-saw, Margery Daw, Sold her bed and lay upon straw.” Margery borrowed the little folks' gold, And lent it the great folks to fight with: They shot it abroad over woodland and wold, Till things began not to go right with Margery Daw, Margery Daw, Who spent all her gold and made money of straw. The little folks roared for their gold back again, And Margery trembled with terror; She called for relief to the land's mighty men, And they said she must pay for her error; “See-saw, look to your straw: We've nothing to say to you, Margery Daw.” Margery Daw was alarmed for her straw: Her wishes this speech didn't suit with, “Oho! mighty men!” said Margery then, “You'll get no more money to shoot with; See-saw, pile up the straw; Bring me a flambeau,” said Margery Daw. They looked very bold, but they very soon saw That their coffers began to look drossy; So they made it a law that fair Margery's straw, Should be gold both in esse and posse. “See-saw, Margery's straw, Is golden by nature, and gold by the law.” Margery Daw struck the sky with her head, And strode o'er the earth like a goddess; And the sword of the conqueror yielded like lead, When it smote upon Margery's bodice. See-saw, plenty of straw Will make us all glorious as Margery Daw. The conqueror fell, and the mighty men saw That they seemed to be safer and stronger; And then they turned round upon Margery Daw, Saying “Straw shall be metal no longer. See-saw, Margery Daw, Get your gold back again, chop up your straw.” Margery wearied her eloquent lips: They had never received her so coldly: A-kimbo they stood, with their hands on their hips, And their right feet put forward most boldly: “See-saw, Margery Daw, Get your gold back again, chop up your straw.” Margery put forth her powerful hand, She seized on the straw all around her; And up rose a flame at her word of command Like the furnace of any brass-founder. “See-saw, Margery Daw Wants her gold back again: flames to the straw.” The omnipotent straw, that had been the world's law, Was soon only cinder and ember: Such a blaze was ne'er seen round Guy Faux on a green, On the night of the fifth of November. “See-saw, pile up the straw, There's a brave bonfire,” said Margery Daw. Down fell, as beneath mighty Juggernaut's car, The small fry of straw-money makers, The tumult of ruin, from near and from far, Once more made the mighty men quakers: “See-saw, Margery Daw, Off with the gold again: give us more straw.” The Jews made a project for Margery Daw, She thought it too ticklish for trying; But they sent her a Scotchman exceedingly braw, To prove 'twas as easy as lying: “See-saw, Margery Daw, A wee bit o' gold and a mickle of straw.” Margery heard the Mac Puzzlehead preach, And she was no whit a logician, She knew little more than the eight parts of speech, Though she wrote with amazing precision “Margery Daw,” “Margery Daw,” The prettiest writing the world ever saw. Margery scattered her treasures abroad, And who was so glorious as she then? He who was backward in Margery's laud, Mac Puzzlehead proved, was a heathen. See-saw, gold in the straw, Who was so glorious as Margery Daw? Up started the small fry of straw-money men, Who seemed to have fallen for ever; They scattered their straw o'er the nation again, And chorused as yet they had never: “See-saw, plenty of straw, Will make us all glorious as Margery Daw.” Margery's glory was darkened afresh, The great men again stood a-kimbo; She feared she was caught in Mac Puzzlehead's mesh, Who had argued her gold out of limbo. “See-saw, pile up the straw, Bring me a flambeau,” said Margery Daw. Again in her anger she darkened the air With the smoke of a vast conflagration, And again to the earth in dismay and despair, Fell the heroes of straw circulation. “See-saw, Margery Daw Owes you no courtesy: burn your own straw.” Around and about came a glad rabble rout, The flames from a distance discerning; And shouting they saw, in the midst of the straw, Mac Puzzlehead's effigy burning. “See-saw, pile up the straw, Roast the Mac Puzzlehead, Margery Daw.” But then to the sky rose a terrible cry, A long and a loud lamentation; And Margery's halls rang with wailings and calls That filled her with deep consternation: “Straw, straw, give us some straw; Straw, or we perish, sweet Margery Daw.” And what happened then? Oh what happened then? Oh! where is the rest of the story? And what was devised by the land's mighty men, To renovate Margery's glory? Oh, there is a flaw in the volume of straw, That tells the true story of Margery Daw. But we find if we pore ancient manuscripts o'er With deep antiquarian endeavour, That Margery's straw became metal once more, “If it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all.” —Hamlet. And she was as glorious as ever. See-saw, plenty of straw Will make us all glorious as Margery Daw. RICH AND POOR; OR SAINT AND SINNER [This is a correct copy of a little poem which has been often printed, and not quite accurately. It first appeared, many years ago, in the Globe and Traveller, and was suggested by a speech in which Mr. Wilberforce, replying to an observation of Dr. Lushington, that “the Society for the Suppression of Vice meddled with the poor alone,” said that “offences of the poor came more under observation than those of the rich.”] The poor man's sins are glaring; In the face of ghostly warning He is caught in the fact Of an overt act— Buying greens on Sunday morning. The rich man's sins are hidden In the pomp of wealth and station; And escape the sight Of the children of light, Who are wise in their generation. The rich man has a kitchen, And cooks to dress his dinner; The poor who would roast To the baker's must post, And thus becomes a sinner. The rich man has a cellar, And a ready butler by him; The poor must steer For his pint of beer Where the saint can't choose but spy him. The rich man's painted windows Hide the concerts of the quality; The poor can but share A crack'd fiddle in the air, Which offends all sound morality. The rich man is invisible In the crowd of his gay society; But the poor man's delight Is a sore in the sight, And a stench in the nose of piety. THE FATE OF A BROOM AN ANTICIPATION [These lines were published in the Examiner of August, 1831. They were then called an anticipation. They may now be fairly entitled a prophecy fulfilled.] Lo! in Corruption's lumber-room, The remnants of a wondrous broom, That walking, talking, oft was seen, Making stout promise to sweep clean, But evermore, at every push, Proved but a stump without a brush. Upon its handle-top, a sconce, Like Brahma's, looked four ways at once: Pouring on king, lords, church, and rabble, Long floods of favour-currying gabble; From four-fold mouth-piece always spinning Projects of plausible beginning, Whereof said sconce did ne'er intend That any one should have an end; Yet still, by shifts and quaint inventions, Got credit for its good intentions, Adding no trifle to the store Wherewith the Devil paves his floor. Found out at last, worn bare and scrubbish, And thrown aside with other rubbish, We'll e'en hand o'er the enchanted stick, As a choice present for Old Nick, To sweep, beyond the Stygian lake, The pavement it has helped to make. BYP AND NOP Promotion BY Purchase and by NO Purchase; or a Dialogue between Captain A. and Colonel Q. Quoth Byp to Nop, “I made my hop By paying for promotion:”— Quoth Nop to Byp, “I made my skip By aid of petticoatian.” Quoth Nop to Byp, “You'll never trip Ascending steps of Gold by:”— Quoth Byp to Nop, “You'll never drop With such a tail to hold by.” [N.B.—Byp, for by purchase, and Nop, for no purchase, are the common official abbreviations in all returns of promotions, and ring the changes through long columns of Parliamentary papers.] MISCELLANEOUS POEMS LETTER TO HIS MOTHER 14 FEBRUARY 1795 Dear Mother, I attempt to write you a letter In verse, tho' in prose, I could do it much better: The Muse, this cold weather sleeps up at Parnassus, And leaves us, poor poets, as stupid as asses: She'll tarry still longer, if she has a warm chamber, A store of old Massic, Ambrosia, and Amber. Dear Mother, don't laugh, you may think she is tipsy, And I, if a poet, must drink like a gipsy: Suppose, I should borrow, the horse of Jack Stenton; A finer ridden beast, no Muse ever went on; Pegasus's fleet wings, perhaps, are now frozen; I'll send her old Stenton's, I know, I've well chosen; Be it frost, be it thaw, the horse can well canter; The sight of the beast, cannot help, to enchant her. All the boys at our school, are well, tho', yet, many Are suffer'd at home, to suck eggs with their Granny. “To-morrow” says daddy, “you must go my dear Billy, To Englefield House; do not cry, you are silly.” Says the Mother, all dress'd in silk, and in sattin; “Don't cram the poor boy, with your Greek, and your Latin; I'll have him a little longer, before mine own eyes; To nurse him, and feed him, with tarts, and minc'd pies; We'll send him to school, when the weather is warmer: Come, kiss me, my pretty, my sweet little charmer.” But now I must banish all fun, and all folly; So doleful's the news, I am going to tell ye: Poor Wade! my schoolfellow, lies low in the gravel; One month ere fifteen, put an end to his travel: Harmless, and mild, and remark'd for goodnature: The cause of his death, was his overgrown stature: His epitaph I wrote, as inserted below; What tribute more friendly, could I on him bestow. The bard craves one shilling, of his own dear Mother; And if you think proper, add to it another. EPITAPH Here lies interr'd, in silent shade, The frail remains of Hamlet Wade; A youth more prom'sing, ne'er took breath; But ere fifteen, laid cold in death. Ye young! ye old! and ye of middle age! Act well your part, for quit the stage Of mortal life one day you must; And like him moulder into dust. LETTER TO ROBERT WALROND 25 SEPTEMBER 1795 Dear Cousin, While distant from your native land, Among the Dons a ruffian band, Forget not him, your little friend Who promis'd you some lines to send. That friendship, which to you I bore Ere you had left Britannia's shore, Still gathers strength, nor can decay, Though marble rocks should wear away. With pleasure Cousin I can tell, That all my friends around are well; I would transfer some little news, Could I prevail upon my muse. My Uncle's ship did meet a foe, Which instantly she brought in tow, Whose value, very soon he found, Was nearly thirty thousand pound! One third I think, should be his share— A wealthy Uncle I declare! To touch the cash his finger itches, I dread 'twill stop in other clutches. I hope a moment you can spare, To let me know how well you fare; How you like the Spanish nation, Men and Women, and their fashion: Say are they handsome stout and tall, Or are they meagre thin and small: Thus send me ev'ry kind of news 'Twill give me pleasure to peruse! Need I inform my Cousin dear, How much I long to see him here; On British ground, of yore an Isle Which Freedom favor'd with a smile; Forsake Madrid, soon leave proud Spain, Then homewards cross the azure main; Calm when you sail may Neptune keep The surgy billows of the deep. Ah! should old Davi ope his jaw And lodge you in his hungry maw; Sorrow pale would fill my breast, To lose my friend would lose my rest. Let not Æolus vex the waves, Lock'd be the winds in roaring caves. Smooth be the sea from shore to shore, Your voyage safe and speedy o'er. How glad your English friends will be, On your return, your face to see; And I how happy when you call, At Chertsey, and at Gogmoor Hall. The name given to his Grandfather's Cottage. I am your Servant and your friend, Adieu—farewell, my verses end. ANSWER TO THE QUESTION “Is History or Biography the more improving Study?” With bright examples the young mind to fire, And Emulation's gen'rous flame inspire, Biography her modest page displays, And follows one alone thro' life's uncertain ways. 'Tis hers, alike, with faithful pen t' impart The virtues, or the failings, of his heart; She tells of all the talents he possesst, She makes us Virtue love, or Vice detest; She makes our hearts espouse the former's cause, And 'twixt the two a glowing contrast draws. Thus does Biography: but Hist'ry too Oft holds out bright examples to the view, And to abhorrence oft, in colours bright, Brings Vice's black deformity to light. But more than this: Time's wasting hand she braves, And former days from dark Oblivion saves; She can recal full many a long past age, Can fill with great events th' instructive page; Can “deeds of days of other years” unfold, And tell the actions of “the times of old”; Can make, in pleasing characters, appear, What now we are, and our forefathers were. She oft, in glowing accents, tells how War “Yokes the red dragons of his iron car,” When, with his train of mis'ries at his hand, He comes to waste and desolate the land, Then, as she shifts the gloomy scene with ease, She tells the blessings of returning Peace. Without her aid, how many a mighty name Would now be totally unknown to Fame! E'en Philip's son, who once so bravely fought, The Prince of Vict'ries, would be quite forgot! Titus' good deeds were in Oblivion thrown, And Cæsar's great ones now no longer known! Hail then to thee, fair Hist'ry! 'tis for thee To wear the golden crown of Victory! Like as the morning star, with humble ray, Throws a faint glimmer at the dawn of day, Soon as the sun begins his beams to shed, He shrinks away to nought, and hides his head: 'Tis thus Biography, whose humble pace Pursues one only through life's eager race; Before bright Hist'ry's open, daring ray, She dwindles into nought, and shrinks away! Hail then to thee, fair Hist'ry! 'tis for thee To wear the golden crown of Victory! EPIGRAMS [Says John Bull, “tho' to aid this vile War I am loth] Says John Bull, “tho' to aid this vile War I am loth, They say 'tis my int'rest and principle both; But of all I was worth by some fellows bereft I have got neither Int'rest nor Principal left.” His Country, some would make't appear, To every Englishman is dear,— All to this truth must surely give in, For 'tis indeed too dear to live in. LIBERTY PART OF A LETTER TO A FRIEND There was a time when Freedom's seraph smile With heav'nly radiance, bless'd this prosp'rous Isle, When Peace and Plenty led their joyful band And pour'd down bliss and pleasure on the land, When Truth and Justice in the realm were found, And British bosoms dwelt on British ground. There was a time (but ah! that time is fled) When crown'd with honors Virtue rais'd her head: When, never failing rev'rence to inspire, Was heard the manly voice of Patriot fire: Heard now no more—no more is Virtue found With joy regarded and with glory crown'd: He who but prays to Heav'n the realm to save, Receives from power—a dungeon and a grave. Long, long alas! “to gath'ring ills a prey” Has British Freedom mourn'd her quick decay! Long, long alas! the iron hand of power Has aim'd its fury at her rock-built Tower, That Tow'r which, led by Truth's and Justice' fires, Rais'd to her blest domain our fame-crown'd sires And piece by piece, has hurl'd its ruins wide To the black gulph of Tyranny and Pride! Who shall restore, (just Heav'n!) her hallow'd reign And rear the sacred edifice again? Who shall to Virtue Liberty restore, And give us all the rights we held before? Alas, our fire is with that Freedom fled, In whose dear cause our great forefathers bled. This was the land where, dear to age and youth, Reign'd Virtue, Freedom, Innocence, and Truth, Where Britons saw, whoe'er in pow'r appear'd, Their rights respected and their laws revered! This is the land where War's destructive train With blood-stain'd sceptre hold their iron reign, Where Persecution's ever hated sway Stamps with black mis'ry each revolving day, Where, while all ties of Justice are contemn'd, To be suspected is to be condemn'd, Where Innocence in dreary dungeons thrown Is left unpitied and unheard to groan, And where sweet Liberty's unfeeling foes Exult and riot in a Nation's woes. O ye, who whilst sweet Concord's flag is furled, Let War's red Demons loose upon the World! Ye, who have sent full many a Hero brave An early victim to a distant grave! By whom [confin'd] in many a dreary cell, Truth, Virtue, Justice, bid the world farewell! Yet know, that Heaven which rules above the sky, Views all your actions with impartial eye, The Widow's pray'rs that Heaven with pity hears And beams compassion on the Orphan's tears, Yes, and that Heaven to which all pow'r belongs, That Heav'n which pities can avenge their wrongs. PEACE When War's infernal banners wide unfurl'd Pour'd their dark wreaths throughout the bleeding world, When o'er the field of death his Harpies flew, And bath'd in blood, a wild insatiate crew, Then, from the groaning Earth reluctant driv'n, Thou fledst, sweet Peace, to seek thy native Heav'n! But now, once more, with thy propitious hand Thou pour'st down pleasure on this gladd'ning land, Once more thou com'st, a “rising beam of light,” And Want's pale cheek smiles feebly at the sight. Welcome, thrice welcome! to our sea-girt shore! O may Britannia mourn thy loss no more! At thy approach may Want and Sorrow fly, And heart-felt gladness beam from ev'ry eye, May ev'ry British breast with rapture burn, And joyful thousands hail thy bless'd return. Celestial Peace! to angels ever given, Who dwell'st serene in yon empyreal Heaven, Where countless Suns their dazzling orbs display And shed around an everlasting day! Now when thou com'st to chace dark Sorrow's shade And heal the wounds War's iron hand has made, May Liberty and Plenty join thy train And smile on Albion's chalky cliffs again! Benignant Power! may thy long-wish'd-for smile Preserve from further woes this suffering Isle, May gentle Concord dwell in ev'ry breast, And Party-Prejudice be lull'd to rest, And all the angry storms of faction cease In the sweet sunshine of returning Peace! THE MAN OF FASHION A Chap whose modish pucker'd shoulders Create a laugh in all beholders, Whose full-stuff'd Cape may well be said To look more knowing than his head; With Boots rais'd far above his knee, And toes as square as square can be;— One who in gaming takes delight, Was last night cheated—cheats to-night, Who'll seldom lend but often borrow, A fool to-day—a knave to-morrow,— To grace a Gala only fit, Much better stock'd with cash than wit, In Folly's temple early bred, With a full purse and empty head, Well skill'd in drinking, flirting, dashing,— Such is a modern Man of Fashion. LETTER TO HIS GRANDMOTHER 16 JULY 1801 Dear Grandmother, From this town where Pride, Fashion, and Business rule, Where mingle the honest, the knave and the fool, Where Vice with success far too often is crown'd, And Virtue as often is penniless found, Where the devil with riches his votaries blesses, Where forestallers live by the people's distresses, Where flourish knaves, pickpockets, beggars and peers, Where much-courted Folly her asses-head rears, Where ladies (but this you will scarcely believe) Go naked,—just like our great-grandmother Eve; (For the sweet reign of Modesty seems to be quite gone, And each dashing young belle goes about in her night-gown) Where juggling and cheating are well understood, And where meet the extremes both of bad and of good— From this town now to write you I take up my pen, And, after long silence, address you again. Here Fashion exerts her all-powerful sway, And oftentimes leads the most cautious astray; An instance of which you full plainly may see In the case of the dashing Sir Peter Bohea. Though Sir Peter denies it, 'tis known very well, He was both born and bred within sound of Bowbell; At twelve years of age so improv'd his friends found him To a worshipful grocer apprentice they bound him, And, to use his own words, “no one up to him comes In selling the Cockneys two-penn'orth of plumbs!” —“Two-pence farthing's the sum, mem, can take nothing off it. If we take off the farthing we lose all our profit!” When out of his time, this experienc'd young elf Thought proper to set up in bus'ness himself, And all things before him he valiantly carried, Till he very unluckily chose to be married. His deary's fam'd dad, one as proud as a lord, Was a great tallow-chandler in Candlewick ward, Who had brought up his daughter by method and rule, To spend like a princess, and act like a fool! He determin'd the charmer should blaze with great spirit, And that nought should extinguish the flame of her merit, And, thinking 'twould only be doing his duty, Resolv'd he would nourish the wick of her beauty, For he said 'twas unjust and ungen'rous to crush light, And she never should gleam like a “damn'd farthing rush-light!” On the cymbals, those instruments now grown so dashing, She could play like a black, or a lady of fashion; And surely no beggar-girl ever was seen, That could strike with such grace on the sweet tambourine! At Change-alley hops she could charmingly dance, She could manage the skipping-rope, read a romance; To set off her charms she made ev'ry endeavour, And in this one respect she was “cursedly clever.” On the heart of poor Peter she seiz'd in a trice, For he thought her far sweeter than sugar or spice! He courted the lady with wonderful glee, And soon of Miss Wick he made Mrs. Bohea! He continued however to thrive in his trade, And in a few months was an Alderman made; Our newly-made Alderman soon was appointed To present an address to the great Lord's Anointed; And his loyal behaviour was there well requited, He gave the address; then knelt down, and was—knighted!!! By this time Sir Peter had realis'd clear The moderate sum of three thousand a year! His lady began her old friends to despise, And look'd on the Cockneys with scorn in her eyes; She teas'd poor Sir Peter without the least pity, No longer to stay in the villainous city; She declar'd she should always be sadly distrest, Unless he would figure away in the West, And now poor Sir Peter his shop has forsaken, And in sweet Grosvenor Square a fine mansion has taken; He's no longer the grocer so frugal and steady, Who once with such care sav'd and hoarded the ready; He now never looks on the bills he's to pay, But only on bills of the op'ra or play; Each ev'ning is spent in some gala or rout, And when creditors call—he is sure to be out. As far as “Gad's curse” or “Gad demme” can go, He can swear like a thief—I beg pardon, a beau; Indeed, he appears quite a different man, And is spending his money as fast as he can, He shines like a star in the scenes of high life, And all for the sake of his “dear, pretty wife”; Whilst, his love to repay, his affectionate spouse Has fix'd two neat horns on his elegant brows! Of this life-loving knight we may certainly say, Like a true dashing hero he “figures away” But he'll soon be unable “to make both ends meet” And then he must “figure away”—in the Fleet! LETTER TO HIS GRANDFATHER 11 AUGUST 1801 Dear Grandfather, I have long been in hopes once more Chertsey to view, Which at present, indeed, we can't very well do; Therefore, being this morning a little at leisure, I take up the pen to address you with pleasure. When of late Spanish batt'ries a vict'ry obtain'd, Which the French proudly boasted their squadron had gain'd, They spread over France a most wonderful story, Declaring their Navy was “cover'd with glory!” “To the Temple of Fame they should quickly advance, Through the valorous deeds of the sailors of France!” But when gallant Saumarez once more drew nigh, These laurel-crown'd heroes thought proper to fly They spread all their canvass (magnanimous elves!) To let the poor Dons fight it out by themselves! And like true Gallic tars, to whom fear was a stranger, They—fled from their friends at the moment of danger! “Vhat! fight de Jack Tar vhen no batt'ries are near, Dey vould send us avay vid de flea in our ear!”— How mad and how vain is their boasting opinion, They could wrest from old England her naval dominion! The standards of Britain o'er Ocean unfurl'd, At once the dismay and delight of the world, Of the darlings of Neptune the triumphs proclaim, And fill Gallia's proud thousands with terror and shame. There is one thing indeed, it has always been held, In which British sailors by French are excell'd; Their skill in this instance their valorous fleet Never fail to display when our squadrons they meet; And Justice must surely compell us to say, They are far our superiors in—running away!!! This art the Great Nation takes so much delight in, Their vessels seem built more for sailing than fighting; And amongst their fam'd heroes 'tis always confest, Those ships which fly fastest are reckon'd the best! In old women and nurses alarm to occasion, They have started again the old bug-bear Invasion; But the folly of this our brave Nelson has shewn, By his glorious attack on the port of Boulogne: Invade us, indeed! All their threats are in vain Whilst the sons of Britannia are Kings of the Main: From these soup-maigre boasters we've little to dread, Whilst our tars by such heroes as Nelson are led; Whilst those truly-brave tars scorn from Frenchmen to fly, And nobly determine to conquer or die! THE STORM The patt'ring rain in torrents pour'd, The echoing thunder loudly roar'd And shook the vaulted sky, The lightning flash'd with vivid glare, And Danger mid the lurid air Sate darkly thron'd on high. Secure within his humble cell, Where Contemplation lov'd to dwell An Hermit view'd the storm; He mark'd the Whirlwind's eddying course And saw with tears its wasteful force The face of day deform. On fiery pinions through the sky He saw the blue-fork'd lightning fly, And spread destruction round; He saw the lofty tree o'erthrown And, all its former beauty flown, Lie with'ring on the ground. “Thus 'tis with Man,” the Hermit cried, “Thus tower his hopes in youthful pride, And thus his wishes soar; But ere he gain the wish'd for Goal Misfortune's tempests round him roll, He falls—to rise no more!” The storm was past, the sky was clear'd: Bright in the West the Sun appear'd And pour'd his golden ray. The flowers with sparkling rain-drops crown'd Diffus'd unusual fragrance round To bless the closing day. “How all is chang'd,” the Hermit cries Whilst pleasure glitters in his eyes, “How beautiful the scene! The fields at morn were parch'd and dry But now beneath the evening sky Display luxuriant green. “And hence I learn, tho' Sorrow's storm Awhile our prospects may deform And hold its dread career, Yet pleasure's Sun returns at last And by the sense of dangers past Is render'd doubly dear.” FROM THE REVELATIONS A FRAGMENT “Arise! arise, to thee 'tis given To view the wonders of the Skies: The dark mysterious ways of Heaven Are open to thine eyes: Thrice-favor'd Mortal, rise! By mystic signs th' eternal God To thee his fix'd intents displays: Behold the woes his chast'ning rod Prepares for future days.” Thus on the lov'd disciple's ears Sweet as the music of the spheres Inspiring sounds from lips celestial fell: Heaven's brazen doors wide open flew: He turned those bright abodes to view Where Saints and Angels dwell. With awe his eyes the Prophet rais'd To where Almighty glory blaz'd, Where cloth'd in never-dying lustre shone The pure ethereal fire, the sapphire-burning throne! Cetera desunt. ON THE DEATH OF SIR RALPH ABERCROMBY Lamented Chief! whom cruel Fate Has doom'd to fall in foreign climes, Bright Glory's shining Angels wait To give thy name to distant times. Each British heart, each noble mind, Shall mourn o'er thy untimely bier, And Gratitude and Pity kind Shall drop the tributary tear! No more thy courage shall inspire Admiring bands with martial heat; Thine eyes have lost their kindling fire, Thy valiant heart has ceas'd to beat! But future times shall sound thy praise, When crown'd with Fame thy name appears; When Hist'ry's splendid page displays “The deeds of days of other years!” THE ALARMISTS PART OF A LETTER TO A FRIEND The Alarmists are all in a great consternation Concerning old England's most sad situation; Their woful lamentings they daily increase And rail at this “shameful, iniquitous, Peace”; In Clubs and in parties they often assemble To drink, to harangue, to lament and to tremble. Now let us suppose, on some mighty affair A Club had convened, it is no matter where, And consider what now I'm about to relate A faithful report of their learned debate. The discussion to open in language most clear With a smirk, and a grin, rose a fam'd Auctioneer: “Hem, hem, Mr. Chairman, I fear we have got In this new-fangled Peace a most villainous lot; Tho' so much 'tis approv'd both in country and town, I fear that the Nation will soon be knock'd down; No concern for our wrongs are the Ministry showing, And we all are a going! a going! a going!!!” Next rose a stout Cobler with visage demure: “This Peace, sir, d'ye see me, I cannot endure. The wax of my heart melts away at the story; I fear we are come to the end of our glory. Our national goodness is tapp'd on the heel, And we soon, very soon shall French pegging awls feel. The Leather of England will soon be in holes, And we cannot last long, poor unfortunate soles. Thus ended the polish'd and erudite railer, And after him rose a magnanimous Tailor: The ninth part of a man, from his dignified station, Amaz'd the whole club, with this flaming oration: “Whatever the friends of this Peace may declare, They have worn all their arguments perfectly bare; With ready cut promises sweeter than honey They have nipp'd off our honor and cabbaged our money; The Peace they've patched up, is they say worth a treasure; But I say they have taken a very bad measure. The shreds of their power, I speak it with wrath, Have reduc'd to a shred all the kingdom's best cloth. Altho' they're as sharp as a needle for wit, I don't value their speeches the crack of a nit. I'm quite in a pucker, my choler is great, Since the threads of our fortune are clipp'd off by fate.” “I could duck them all well,” said a Poulterer so spruce, “Surely treatment so foul, none would bear but a goose!” An Oilman rose next: “Sir, I say on my verity From the flask is ooz'd out all the oil of prosperity. Tho' I love not with power to quarrel and stickle I think we are all in a terrible pickle.” “Zounds!” bawl'd a stout Cook, “In a pickle indeed! In a pickle from which we shall never be freed! Here's a very fine mess; smoke my wig, Mr. Chairman, That there Bony part is a devilish rare man! We must soon go to pot, spite of all we can do; When I think of his sauce, I am quite in a stew; This is no time to trifle; I quake like a jelly; Mounseer will soon stow our roast beef in his belly. Our sop of a Premier has suck'd up our treasures, I'm not such a cake as to puff off his measures; The sweets of his Peace we poor Devils shall taste When Frenchmen come over our country to baste. John Bull once was fat, once he lived upon clover, But he's now overdone and completely done over; He's roasted, he's dish'd—Zounds! I broil with vexation! Not one drop of gravy is left in the Nation. A very fine Peace have our Ministers plann'd, We must starve whilst they feed on the fat of the land! Of the good they have done they may constantly speak, But, curse me, 'tis nothing but bubble and squeak!” “Time, my friends,” said the Chairman, “forbids me to push on To any great length, this important discussion. In a fortnight's time hence to this point we'll return, But at present I think 'twill be best to adjourn. 'Tis prov'd that our Ministers plans are pursuing Which only can end in confusion and ruin; That in all their vile minds no good principle rules; That one half are knaves and the other half fools; That for England's misfortunes they care not a feather— So, my friends, let us all be unhappy together!” PARAPHRASE FROM THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER OF ISAIAH Woe to thy numbers fierce and rude, Thou madly rushing multitude, Loud as the Tempest which o'er Ocean raves! Woe to the Nations proud and strong Which pour tumultuously along, As rolls the foaming stream its long resounding waves! As the noise of mighty seas, As the loudly eddying breeze, Shall gath'ring nations rush, a powerful band; But Israel's God, in burning wrath unfurl'd Shall stretch to sweep them from the World His thunder-grasping hand. As, when adverse winds engage, Far and wide the chaff is blown, As, before the whirlwind's rage, Flies the rolling thistle down, So, at the avenging nod Of a great Eternal God, Shall fly, to endless ruin driven Th' oppressors of the weak—the enemies of Heav'n. THE COMPARISON As Jove t'other day was in nectar regaling, When Juno for once put a stop to her railing Of Hermes he asked, having grown rather mellow, “What d'ye think of Lucretia, my comical fellow?” “Is't the Roman Lucretia,” quoth Hermes, “you mean, Or Lucretia, the beauty of Shacklewell Green?” “Why, I mean her of old,” answer'd Jove with an oath, “But prythee let's hear what you think of them both.” “Lucretia of Rome,” Hermes quickly replied, “Had plenty of beauty and plenty of pride; I would not be thought at her virtues to scoff, Yet I think she did wrong when she kill'd herself off. But the modern Lucretia, to say't is my duty, Has twice as much virtue and twice as much beauty, And may safely defy envy's venemous railings, As with all the first's charms she has none of her failings.” “Indeed,” cried the Thunderer, “a creature so charming Must cause in the envious sensations alarming; She's a toast for immortals, 'tis plain to be seen, So here's to the beauty of Shacklewell Green!” ON THE DEATH OF A LAP DOG CALL'D LADY Oh could I wake the sounding Lyre To dithyrambic strains sublime; Or would the gentle Muse inspire One single spark of Pindar's fire, To aid my feeble rhyme: Then, Lady, then thy praise to tell Would I full many a stanza fill, Long on thy talents would I dwell, Thy charming bark, thy piteous yell Most musically shrill! Though to record thy humble fate No pompous monument arise, Yet on thy lowly dust shall wait (Denied how often to the great) A tear from beauty's eyes! Poor Lady! To thy humble urn Far better strains than these are due; None surely can thy memory spurn; If beauty for thy loss can mourn The Muse must mourn thee too. TO MRS. SEWELL ON READING HER POEMS Of old, when Freedom's sacred fire Bless'd Grecia's favor'd clime, The infant Muse first tuned the lyre, And rais'd her voice sublime. Then taught by Fancy, Nature's child In numbers regularly wild, The nodding woods and rocks among, The Lesbian nymph oppress'd with care Pour'd all her sorrows to the air, In unaffected song. But when the Muse on Latian plains Diffus'd her gen'rous fire, No female woke to deathless strains The many sounding lyre;— How far more bless'd the British fair! With them the Muse delights to share Her softest smile, her brightest flame; She loves their artless lays to trace, And in the most exalted place Enrolls her Sewell's name. For not the boast of earthly power, The pomp of earthly joy, The transient blessings of an hour, Thy nobler lyre employ; To teach fair Virtue's spotless laws, To aid Religion's sacred cause To thee the glorious task was given; The strain of triumph to prolong, And swell the rapture-breathing song Which lifts the mind to Heaven! IMITATED FROM OSSIAN (BARRATHAN) The shades of night are gath'ring fast, And coldly blows the ev'ning blast; Unshelter'd on the rocky shore I sit, whilst foaming billows roar Around in wild commotion; But colder is my fate severe For ever doom'd to linger here, Doom'd here to waste my morn of life And mark your never-ending strife, Blue tumbling waves of ocean! Not always by the roaring wave, Where sullen blasts are yelling, Not always in the dreary cave Was Nina-thoma's dwelling. Once in the echoing hall of Kings Oft as the shades of ev'ning fell I struck my Harp's responsive strings And bade the song of pleasure swell. Then, Uthal, with insidious art, Then didst thou gain my Virgin heart, For thee Torthoma's halls I fled, With thee each happy day I led Unthinking of to-morrow: What love was e'er more true than mine? False as thou art, it still is thine; Then wherefore leave me here to pine In never-ceasing sorrow? REBUS Take three-quarters of fortune connected with chance And one-half of a sprightly agreeable dance, To these add two-thirds of what serves to restrain, And a General who brings twenty-five in his train; In all three united at once may be seen The glory of Rome and of Shacklewell Green. ON A LAP DOG OF MISS ? NAM'D QUISI (SIGNIFIES IN CHINESE, SON OF THE DEVIL) Of little crop-ear'd Pug to write In lofty notes heroic, Might sure the patience put to flight Of pleasure-hating stoic. But since ? gives command, 'Tis nothing more than duty; What youthful bard could e'er withstand The sacred will of beauty? Oh wondrous Quisi! Who can see And seeing, not admire? Rightly to praise a Dog like thee Demands a Pindar's Lyre. “Son of the Devil,” enchanting Qui, Should I extol thee to the sky Pray where would be the wonder? Much greater puppies than thyself Have oft by many a rhyming elf Been sung in notes of thunder. Though some to all thy beauties blind Thy praise may take no share in, I'll call thee loveliest of thy kind And charming past comparing. Yes! all who call thee “ugly beast” More blind than any stone are; Thou hast reflected charms at least Thanks to thy lovely owner. How to the Sunflower's gaudy leaves Is so much brightness given? Reflected splendor it receives, Drawn from the Sun of Heaven. E'en so L?'s smiles divine On whatsoe'er they deign to shine, Than morning rays more tender, Reflected beauty can bestow— Thence all thy charms, Oh Quisi, flow— 'Tis hers to make e'en darkness glow With Heaven's meridian splendor. “WITH TRUEST REPENTANCE” With truest repentance, sincerest submission, On my knees I present this most humble petition Entreating that you will a pardon confer. Then let not your frowns a poor Devil dispirit Who owns that he scarcely a pardon can merit For presumptuously thinking an Angel could err. PADDY'S LAMENTATION Sweet Molly O'Bog! Oh! my shoul's dearest treasure, Now you're gone, my dear joy, I shall never know pleasure. Your loss, my dear Molly, long, long shall I cry for; Then, arrah! my Jewel, ah! what did ye die for? Oh! my beautiful Molly, so wild and so frisky! You had plenty of beef, and potatoes and whiskey! You had all you could wish and nothing to cry for; Then, arrah! my Jewel, ah! what did you die for? Ah! why did you die now and leave me behind here? Your equal, sweet Molly, I never shall find here! Such another dear creature in vain should I try for: Then, arrah! my Jewel, ah! what did you die for? ACROSTIC [Long to her name I've struck the Lyre] Long to her name I've struck the Lyre; Unblest, alas! with Pindar's fire, Can my weak muse one stanza raise Rightly transcendent charms to praise? Endowed with ev'ry grace refin'd That decks the person or the mind, In vain the Muse might strive to swell A song that half her praise should tell. Oh! blest with graces rarely found Like morning rays her smiles around Delight and life can shower; Her every charm might win a heart, And when combin'd they aim the dart Must gain unbounded power. ON THE FIRST LEAF OF THE BOOK OF THE AUTHOR'S POEMS WRITTEN AND PRESENTED TO L.O. A youth, who by the sacred fount On fam'd Parnassus' ancient Mount Pass'd his unprofitable hours In gathering weeds instead of flowers, Lays, at the feet of wit and beauty, This humble offering of his duty. Oh! then with smiles his nothings cherish! Without them they are sure to perish: Thy smile can make e'en darkness glow, Can e'en on Quisi charms bestow, And may, perhaps, to strains like these Impart some little power to please. GLEE Quickly pass the social glass, Hence with idle sorrow! No delay—enjoy to-day, Think not of to-morrow! Life at best is but a span, Let us taste it whilst we can; Let us still with smiles confess, All our aim is happiness! Childish fears, and sighs and tears Still to us are strangers; Why destroy the bud of joy With ideal dangers? Let the song of pleasure swell; Care with us shall never dwell; Let us still with smiles confess All our aim is happiness! TO A FRIEND AT GUERNSEY Again a few dull lines I send, To greet my absent silent friend— Tho' seldom with unworthy rhyme I thus intrude upon your time, I take these means to prove it true I ever shall remember you, Tho' with regret I plainly see That you have quite forgotten me. What can this strange neglect betoken? Will your long silence ne'er be broken? And must I daily hope in vain To trace your characters again? Now in the name of all that's kind Can you no leisure minute find, Just half a line or so to pop in, If nothing more than “This comes hopping”? 'Tis now the time when Turkies bleed, And children play, and cocknies feed; Therefore in rhyme it stands to reason, I ought, as usual at this Season, My wishes for your health expressing To send you o'er the Bellman's blessing: Thro' all the coming year, my friend, May mirth and joy your steps attend! May you a merry Christmas share Untroubled by old sulky Care, And banish far his Demons murky, With Aldermanic pie and Turkey! No longer shall my Muse intrude, My time is short, I must conclude; More of this scrawl is not required, For, I'm in haste—and you are tired. Farewell—and prythee if you can, Sir, Let me have something like an Answer. So till your welcome hand I see, “Adieu! Adieu! remember me!” TO MATILDA The wind howls around and the swift rain is pouring, The storm beaten billows tumultuously roll; But though fiercely the tempests of winter are roaring, More fierce is the tempest that wars in my soul! Though duty commands it, love mocks the endeavour, To forget thee, Matilda! to leave thee for ever! The bonds of affection can int'rest dissever, Or prudence the noblest of passions controul? Dear, dear to the sailor, long toss'd on the ocean, Again his lov'd home, friends and country to see; To me, long the slave of each ardent emotion, More dear is the transport of gazing on thee. Though pride may the beauties of nature be scorning, The peasant with joy hails the breath of the morning, Sweet to him are the smiles Spring's dominion adorning, But the smiles of Matilda are sweeter to me. And must we then part to be no more united? And must I, Matilda, each hope then resign, Each hope which my too sanguine fancy delighted, When I thought that thy heart beat responsive to mine? Farewell! thou dear source of my pain and my pleasure! May thy joys, like thy virtues be still without measure! But where shall I meet with so matchless a treasure; Oh! where find a heart I could value like thine? THE MONKS OF ST. MARK 'Tis midnight: the sky is with clouds overcast; The forest-trees bend in the loud-rushing blast; The rain strongly beats on these time-hallow'd spires; The lightning pours swiftly its blue-pointed fires; Triumphant the tempest-fiend rides in the dark, And howls round the old abbey-walls of St. Mark! The thunder, whose roaring the trav'ller appals, Seems as if with the ground it would level the walls: But in vain pours the storm-king this horrible rout; The uproar within drowns the uproar without; For the friars, with Bacchus, not Satan, to grapple, The refect'ry have met in, instead of the chapel. 'Stead of singing Te Deums, on ground-pressing knees, They were piously bawling songs, catches, and glees: Or, all speakers, no hearers, unceasing, untir'd, Each stoutly held forth, by the spirit inspir'd, Till the Abbot, who only the flock could controul, Exclaim'd: “Augustine! pr'ythee push round the bowl!” The good brother obey'd; but, oh direful mishap! Threw its scalding contents in Jeronimo's lap! And o'er his bare feet as the boiling tide stream'd, Poor Augustine fretted, Jeronimo scream'd, While Pedro protested, it vex'd him infernally, To see such good beverage taken “externally!” The Abbot, Francisco, then feelingly said: “Let that poor wounded devil be carried to bed: And let Augustine, who, I boldly advance, Is the whole and sole cause of this fatal mischance, If e'er to forgiveness he dare to aspire, Now bear to his cell the unfortunate friar.” He rose to obey, than a snail rather quicker, But, finding his strength much diminish'd by liquor, Declar'd, with a hiccup, he scarcely could stand, And begged brother Pedro to lend him a hand. Brother Pedro consented, but all was not right, Till Nicholas offer'd to carry a light. By the head and the feet then their victim they held, Who with pain and with fear most tremendously yell'd; And with one little lamp that scarce shone through the gloom, In path curvilinear march'd out of the room, And, unheeding the sound of the rain and the blast, Through the long dismal corridor fearlessly pass'd. From the right to the left, from the left to the right, Brother Nicholas reel'd, inconsiderate wight! For not seeing the stairs to the hall-floor that led, Instead of his heels he soon stood on his head: He rolls to the bottom, the lamp-flame expires, And darkness envelopes the wondering friars! He squall'd, for the burning oil pour'd on his hand; Bewilder'd did Pedro and Augustine stand: Then loud roar'd the thunder, and Pedro, in dread, Abandon'd his hold of Jeronimo's head, And prone on the floor fell this son of the cowl, And howl'd, deeply-smarting, a terrible howl! Poor Augustine's bosom with terror was cold, On finding his burthen thus slide from his hold: Then, cautiously stealing, and groping around, He felt himself suddenly struck to the ground; Yells, groans, and strange noises, were heard in the dark, And, trembling and sweating, he pray'd to St. Mark! Meanwhile, the good Abbot was boosing about; When, a little alarm'd by the tumult without, Occasion'd by poor Brother Nich'las's fall From the corridor-stairs to the floor of the hall, Like a true jolly friend of good orderly laws, He serpentin'd out to discover the cause. Bewilder'd by liquor, by haste, and by fright, He forgot that he stood in great need of a light; When hiccuping, reeling, and curving along, And humming a stave of a jolly old song, He receiv'd a rude shock from an object unseen, For he came in full contact with Saint Augustine! By Jeronimo's carcase tripp'd up unawares, He was instantly hurl'd down the corridor-stairs; Brother Nicholas there, from the floor cold and damp, Was rising with what yet remain'd of his lamp; And, the worthy superior's good supper to spoil, Regal'd his strange guest with a mouthful of oil! Thence sprung the dire tumult, which, rising so near, Had fill'd Augustine with confusion and fear: But the sons of St. Mark, now appearing with tapers, At once put an end to his pray'rs and his vapors; They reel'd back to their bowls, laugh'd at care and foul weather, And were shortly all under the table together. “WHEN HOPE HER WARM TINTS ON THE FUTURE SHALL CAST” When Hope her warm tints on the future shall cast, And Memory illumine the days that are past, May their mystical colours, by fancy combined, Be as bright as thy thoughts, and as pure as thy mind. May Hope's fairy radiance in clouds never set, Nor Memory look dark with the mists of regret; For thee may their visions unchangeable shine, And prove a more brilliant reality thine. TO MRS. DE ST. CROIX ON HER RECOVERY When wintry storms, with envious pow'r, The glorious orb of day o'ercast; When black and deep the snow-clouds low'r, And coldly blows th' ungenial blast; The feather'd race, no longer gay, Who joy'd in summer's glowing reign, Sit drooping on the leafless spray, And mourn the desolated plain. But when, at spring's celestial call, Subsides the elemental strife, When drifting snows no longer fall, And nature kindles into life, Each little tenant of the grove Makes hill and dale with song resound, And pleasure, gratitude, and love, From thousand echoes ring around. And thus, when thou wast doom'd to pain, On sickness' cheerless couch reclin'd, Love, duty, friendship, sigh'd in vain, And at thy transient loss repin'd. But grief and pain no more assail, And all with smiles thy steps attend; With renovated bliss they hail Their guide, their parent, and their friend. LETTER TO HARRY SEDGWICK 26 DECEMBER 1805 Your friendly verse was quite a treat To me who love the short and sweet; Alike of rhyme and wit observant It vastly pleas'd your humble servant. The bellman now his blessing sends To all his customers and friends, In dismal sonnets nightly crying Because the poor old year is dying; And shall not I, a brother poet, Who prize true friendship when I know it, The bellman's bright example follow, That tuneful offering of Apollo? While he a merry Christmas wishes To all the friends of pans and dishes (Announcing with portentous face Destruction to the Turkey race) My feeble muse her voice prolongs, And joins with his sublimer songs To thank in accents kind and free The few, few friends that care for me, In rhyme to friends alone addressed, And you among the first and best. TIME Passan vostri trionfi e vostre pompe; Passan le signorie, passano i regni.— Cosi 'l tempo trionfa i nomi e'l mondo. Petrarca. Whence is the stream of Time? What source supplies Its everlasting flow? What gifted hand Shall raise the veil by dark Oblivion spread, And trace it to its spring? What searching eye Shall pierce the mists that veil its onward course, And read the future destinies of man? The past is dimly seen: the coming hour Is dark, inscrutable to human sight: The present is our own; but, while we speak, We cease from its possession, and resign The stage we tread on, to another race, As vain, and gay, and mortal as ourselves. And why should man be vain? He breathes to-day, To-morrow he is not: the labored stone Preserves awhile the name of him that was: Time strikes the marble column to the ground, And sinks in dust the sculptured monument. Yet man is vain, and, with exulting thought, Rears the proud dome and spacious colonnade, Plants the wide forest, bids the garden bloom Where frowned the desert, excavates the earth, And, gathering up the treasures of her springs, Rolls the full stream through flow'r-enamelled banks, Where once the heather struck its roots in sand. With joy he hails, with transitory joy, His new creations: his insatiate pride Exults in splendor which he calls his own. As if possessions could be called our own, Which, in a point of ever-varying time, By force, by fraud, by purchase, or by death, Will change their lords, and pass to other hands. Then since to none perpetual use is given, And heir to heir, as wave to wave, succeeds, How vain the pride of wealth! how vain the boast Of fields, plantations, parks, and palaces, If Death invades alike, with ruthless arm, The peasant's cottage, and the regal tower, Unawed by pomp, inflexible by gold! Death comes to all. His cold and sapless hand Waves o'er the world, and beckons us away. Who shall resist the summons? Child of earth! While yet the blood runs dancing through thy veins, Impelled by joy and youth's meridian heat, 'Twere wise, at times, to change the crowded haunts Of human splendor, for the woodland realms Of solitude, and mark, with heedful ear, The hollow voice of the autumnal wind, That warns thee of thy own mortality. Death comes to all. Not earth's collected wealth, Golcondian diamonds and Peruvian gold, Can gain from him the respite of an hour. He wrests his treasure from the miser's grasp, Dims the pale rose on beauty's fading cheek, Tears the proud diadem from kingly brows, And breaks the warrior's adamantine shield. Man yields to Death; and man's sublimest works Must yield at length to Time. The proud one thinks Of life's uncertain tenure, and laments His transitory greatness. While he boasts His noble blood, from ancient kings derived, And views with careless and disdainful eye The humble and the poor, he shrinks in vain From anxious thoughts, that teach his sickening heart, That he is like the beings he contemns, The creature of an hour; that when a few, Few years have past, that little spot of earth, That dark and narrow bed, which all must press, Will level all distinction. Then he bids The marble structure rise, to guard awhile, A little while, his fading memory. Thou lord of thousands! Time is lord of thee: Thy wealth, thy glory, and thy name, are his. Art may protract the blow, but cannot bar His certain course, nor shield his destined prey. The wind and rain assail thy sumptuous domes: They sink, and are forgotten. All that is Must one day cease to be. The chiefs and kings, That awe the nations with their pomp and power, Shall slumber with the chiefs and kings of old: And Time shall leave no monumental stone, To tell the spot of their eternal rest. THE VIGILS OF FANCY NO. I The wind is high, and mortals sleep; And through the woods, resounding deep, The wasting winds of Autumn sweep, While waves remurmur hollowly. Beside this lake's sequester'd shore, Where foam-crown'd billows heave and roar, And pines, that shelter'd bards of yore, Wave their primeval canopy, At midnight hour I rove alone, And think on days for ever flown, When not a trace of care was known, To break my soul's serenity. To me, when day's loud cares are past, And coldly blows th' autumnal blast, And yellow leaves around are cast In melancholy revelry, While Cynthia rolls through fields of blue, 'Tis sweet these fading groves to view, With ev'ry rich and varied hue Of foliage smiling solemnly. Matur'd by Time's revolving wing, These fading groves more beauties bring Than all the budding flow'rs of Spring, Or Summer's glowing pageantry. All hail! ye breezes wild and drear, That peal the death song of the year, And with the waters thund'ring near Combine in awful harmony! Methinks, as round your murmurs sail, I hear a spirit in the gale, That seems to whisper many a tale Of dark and ancient mystery. Ye bards, that in these sacred shades, These tufted woods, and sloping glades, Awoke, to charm the sylvan maids, Your soul-entrancing minstrelsy! Say, do your spirits yet delight To rove, beneath the starry night, Along this water's margin bright, Or mid the woodland scenery, And strike, to notes of tender fire, With viewless hands the shadowy lyre, Till all the wand'ring winds respire A more than mortal symphony? Come, Fancy, come, romantic maid! No more in rainbow vest array'd, But robed to suit the sacred shade Of midnight's deep sublimity. By thee inspir'd, I seem to hold High converse with the good and bold, Who fought and fell, in days of old, To guard their country's liberty. Roused from Oblivion's mould'ring urn, The chiefs of ancient times return; Again the battle seems to burn, And rings the sounding panoply! And while the war-storm rages loud, In yonder darkly rolling cloud Their forms departed minstrels shroud, And wake the hymns of victory. Far hence all earthly thoughts be hurl'd! Thy regions, Fancy, shine unfurl'd, Amid the visionary world I lose the sad reality. Led by thy magic pow'r sublime, From shore to shore, from clime to clime, Uncheck'd by distance or by time, My steps shall wander rapidly. Thy pow'r can all the past restore, Bid present ills afflict no more, And teach the spirit to explore The volume of futurity. MIDNIGHT Oh, clear are thy waters, thou beautiful stream! And sweet is the sound of thy flowing; And bright are thy banks in the silver moon-beam, While the zephyrs of midnight are blowing. The hawthorn is blooming thy channel along, And breezes are waving the willow, And no sound of life but the nightingale's song Floats over thy murmuring billow. Oh sweet scene of solitude! dearer to me Than the city's fantastical splendor! From the haunts of the crowd I have hasten'd to thee, Nor sigh for the joys I surrender. From the noise of the throng, from the mirth of the dance, What solace can misery borrow? Can riot the care-wounded bosom entrance, Or still the pulsations of sorrow? ‘I DUG, BENEATH THE CYPRESS SHADE” I dug, beneath the cypress shade, What well might seem an elfin's grave; And every pledge in earth I laid, That erst thy false affection gave. I pressed them down the sod beneath; I placed one mossy stone above; And twined the rose's fading wreath Around the sepulchre of love. Frail as thy love, the flowers were dead, Ere yet the evening sun was set: But years shall see the cypress spread, Immutable as my regret. REMEMBER ME E tu, chi sa se mai Ti sovverrai di me? Metastasio. And what are Hope's enchanting dreams, That melt, like morning mists, away? And what are Fancy's golden beams, That glow with transitory day? While adverse stars my steps impel, To climes remote, my love, from thee, Will that dear breast with pity swell, And wilt thou still remember me? Alas! I hoped, from Britain's shore My wayward feet would never rove: I hoped to share my little store, With thee, my first, my only love! No more those hopes my breast elate: No more thy lovely form I see: But thou wilt mourn thy wanderer's fate, And thou wilt still remember me. When twilight-shades the world o'erhung, Oft hast thou loved with me to stray, While Philomela sweetly sung The dirge of the departing day. But when our cherished meads and bowers Thy solitary haunts shall be, Oh! then recall those blissful hours; Oh! then, my love, remember me! When Spring shall bid the forest live, And clothe the hills and vales with green; Or Summer's ripening hand shall give New beauties to the sylvan scene; Reflect, that thus my prospects smiled, Till changed by Fortune's stern decree: And wintry storms, severe and wild, Shall bid thee still remember me. For wintry storms have overcast And blighted all my hopes of joy: Vain joys of life, so quickly past! Vain hopes, that clouds so soon destroy! Around us cares and dangers grow: Between us rolls the restless sea: Yet this one thought shall sooth my woe, That thou wilt still remember me. And when, thy natal shades among, While noon-tide rays their fervors shower, The poet's sadly-pleasing song Shall charm thy melancholy hour; When Zephyr, rustling in the grove, Sighs feebly through the spreading tree, Think 'tis the whispering voice of love, And pity, and remember me! Remember me, when morning's call Shall bid thee leave thy lonely bed: Remember me, when evening-fall Shall tinge the skies with blushing red: Remember me, when midnight sleep Shall set excursive Fancy free; And should'st thou wake, and wake to weep, Still, in thy tears, remember me. Farewell, my love! the paths of truth, The paths of happiness pursue: But ever mindful of the youth, Who loved thee with a flame so true. And though to thy transcendent form Admiring courts should bow the knee, Still be thy breast with pity warm, Still, still, my love, remember me! ROMANCE Death! the mourner's surest aid! Mark my sad devotion: Hear a lost, forsaken maid, Mourn with wild emotion! I my griefs unpitied pour To the winds that round me roar, On the billow-beaten shore Of the lonely ocean. Where the sea's extremest line Seems with ether blended, Still I see the white sails shine To the breeze extended. False one! still I mark thy sail Spread to catch the favoring gale, Soon shall storms thy bark assail, And thy crimes be ended! By the mighty tempests tost, Death-flames round thee burning, On a bleak and desert coast, Whence is no returning;— Thou o'er all thy friends shalt weep, Buried in th' unpitying deep; Thou thy watch of woe shalt keep, Vainly, deeply, mourning. Unattended shalt thou rove, O'er the mountain dreary, Through the haunted, pathless grove, Through the desert eerie: Unassuaged thy tears shall flow; None shall sooth or share thy woe, When thy blood runs cold and slow, And thy limbs are weary! Far from haunts of humankind, Vengeful Heaven impelling, Thou thy dying bed shalt find, Where cold blasts are yelling. None shall hear thee, none shall save, In thy monumental cave, None shall weep, where tempests rave Round thy narrow dwelling! ADDRESS SPOKEN BY LIEUTENANT LASCELLES, PREVIOUS TO THE COMEDY OF JOHN BULL, OR AN ENGLISHMAN'S FIRESIDE; PERFORMED BY THE OFFICERS OF H.M.S. VENERABLE Good friends! kind spectators! and countrymen brave! Who guard Britons' rights on the foam-crested wave! Our endeavors to-night your attention require To a tale of John Bull and his family fire. John Bull is a compound of firmness and wildness Blending courage with feeling, and spirit with mildness; To those who embrace him he gives a good greeting; To those who insult him he gives a good beating; And proves that John Bull, wheresoever he goes, Has a hand for his friends and a fist for his foes. Again for our scenes we those ensigns display, Which triumph'd with Duncan on Camperdown's day: And should the proud foe, on the wide-rolling main, Bid the Ven'rable wave them in battle again, Victorious again o'er the deep she shall ride, And bring one trophy more to John Bull's fireside. ADDRESS WRITTEN BY MR. PEACOCK AND SPOKEN BY LT. HAVERFIELD Friends! Countrymen! judges! who, ranged in your stations, Look with critical eye on our stage decorations— Attend to a manager's humble petition, Who your favor demands for this night's exhibition. We dazzle your eyes with no changes of scenery, Triumphal processions, or magic machinery; No thunderstorm rattles, no witch intervenes; A flag is our curtain, and flags are our scenes. Those flags long the storm and the battle have braved, Those flags in the breezes of triumph oft waved, When the Ven'rable, ever illustrious in story, On Camperdown's billows bore Duncan to glory! And now, if your fancy such influence carries, As to place you with us in the centre of Paris, Your amusement perhaps this reflection may sweeten, That you laugh at those fops you so often have beaten. OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE TO THE COMEDY OF WILD OATS, FOR THE INTENDED PERFORMANCE OF THAT COMEDY BY THE OFFICERS OF H.M.S. VENERABLE O'er wintry wastes while blasts ungenial freeze, And clouds and darkness veil the raging seas, What magic pow'r can Nature's gloom controul, And charm the hours that linger as they roll? Mirth, social Mirth, that sportive trips along, With cheerful jest and care-consuming song: Her playful arts the frowns of Fortune chace, With pleasure deck stern Winter's wrinkled face, Wake the light laugh, the mutual smile inspire, And gild with joy John Bull's domestic fire. At her command again our stage we rear, To greet the friends we oft have welcomed here; And now Wild Oats on this fair field we sow, Where Duncan bade immortal laurels grow. Kind friends! brave countrymen! who guard in fight Britannia's glory and her sov'reign's right! Oh may you still, as o'er the deep you ride, Conquest your crown, and Liberty your guide, Mid wars and storms that noblest harvest raise, Your grateful country's everlasting praise. EPILOGUE Though grave were our judges, their office, 'tis certain, Was dissolved and annulled by the fall of the curtain; Unless your warm plaudits command repetition, And affix your great seal to their lasting commission. From the bench of their judgment now humbly descending, From your higher tribunal their sentence attending, Oh! if justly they judge, discompose not their gravity! Let them still reward virtue, and punish depravity: And let not your keen and impartial discernment Pronounce on their court sine die adjournment. From our more modern courts a wise practice to borrow, Whose word is to-morrow, to-morrow, to-morrow, To avoid all the dangers of precipitation, May we move that this cause have r?-c?nsideration? Alas! our poor bard fears his chance is precarious, So numerous his judges, with fancies so various! When the long-besieged turrets of Ilion were burning, And the storm-beaten Greeks in confusion returning, Meneläus, whom fate had long tost like a feather, Was in Pharos detained by the force of bad weather, Where his comrades, for want of more delicate dishes, Were forced to subsist on the raw little fishes. The nymph Halosydne, old Proteus's daughter, Who heard him lament by the side of the water, Assured him, his fortunes would never be better, Unless his bold cunning old Proteus could fetter. It called forth the whole of his skill and his vigor, To bind the wild god of the changeable figure: For he danced, flounced, and bounded, in ceaseless mutation, And filled Meneläus with strange consternation; Now a bubble, a doctor, a cabbage, a tailor, A jackall, a courtier, a lion, a sailor; Now a lord, all perfume, protestation, and paper; Now a talkative patriot, that vanished in vapor. In his own shape at last, he addressed him adagio, And wished him fair breezes, and buono viaggio. Now taste is a Proteus, you critics well know it, And to bind him oft baffles the strength of a poet. Here smiling, there frowning, here blighting, there blooming, I see him at once all his figures assuming. Then well may the prospect of failure dismay us, For our author feels sure, he is no Meneläus. Yet since strenuous his aim, in reflection to render A ray of our ancient theatrical splendor, On his humble attempt be such fortune attendant, As to-night o'er this Proteus to gain the ascendant, That the gales of your favor, with generous commotion, May waft his glad bark through the critical ocean! THE ART OF THE MODERN DRAMA Let trick and mirth nonsensically loud Catch the perched rabble in its greasy cloud, Whirled o'er the stage while humorous tables fly And witty punch-bowls strike the canvas sky. Let canting patriots prove their lungs are good And oft be heard though seldom understood; Confound in chaos all terrestrial things, Pugs, lovers, horses, charioteers and kings: The bellowing pit shall hail thy rash endeavour, And stage-box Jacky say: “Gad's curse, that's clever!” FAREWELL TO MEIRION Meirion, farewell! thy sylvan shades, Thy mossy rocks and bright cascades, Thy tangled glens and dingles wild, Might well detain the Muses' child. But can the son of science find, In thy fair realm, one kindred mind, One soul sublime, by feeling taught, To wake the genuine pulse of thought, One heart by nature formed to prove True friendship and unvarying love? No—Bacchus reels through all thy fields, Her brand fanatic frenzy wields, And ignorance with falsehood dwells, And folly shakes her jingling bells. Meirion, farewell—and ne'er again My steps shall press thy mountain reign, Nor long on thee my memory rest, Fair as thou art—unloved, unblessed. And ne'er may parting stranger's hand Wave a fond blessing on thy land, Long as disgusted virtue flies From folly, drunkenness, and lies; Long as insulted science shuns The steps of thy degraded sons; Long as the northern tempest roars Round their inhospitable doors. NECESSITY ??? ??? ??? ??????. Euripides: Alcestis. Strophe My steps have pressed the flowers, That to the Muses' bowers The eternal dews of Helicon have given: And trod the mountain height, Where Science, young and bright, Scans with poetic gaze the midnight-heaven; Yet have I found no power to vie With thine, severe Necessity! No counteracting spell sublime, By Orpheus, breathed in elder time, The tablets of initiate Thrace contain: No drug imbued with strength divine, To sons of Æsculapian line, By pitying Phœbus taught, to soothe the stings of pain. Antistrophe Thee, goddess, thee alone None seek with suppliant moan: No votive wreaths thine iron altars dress: Immutably severe, The song thou dost not hear, That speaks the plaint of mortal wretchedness. Oh, may I ne'er more keenly feel Thy power, that breaks the strength of steel, With whose dread course concordant still Jove executes his sovereign will: Vain were his might, unseconded by thee. Regret or shame thou canst not know; Nor pity for terrestrial woe Can check thy onward course, or change thy stern decree. Epode And thou, in patience bear thy doom, Beneath her heaviest bonds opprest: Tears cannot burst the marble tomb, Where e'en the sons of gods must rest. In life, in death, most loved, most blest, Was she for whom our fruitless tears are shed; And round her cold sepulchral bed, Unlike the tombs of the promiscuous dead, Wreaths of eternal fame shall spread, By matchless virtue merited. There oft the traveller from his path shall turn, To grace with holy rites her funeral urn, And muse beneath the lonely cypress shade, That waves, in silent gloom, where her remains are laid. YOUTH AND AGE ? ?????? ??? ?????? ????? ?? ?? ?????, ?. ?. ?. Euripides: Hercules Furens. To me the hours of youth are dear, In transient light that flow: But age is heavy, cold, and drear, As winter's rocks of snow. Already on my brows I feel His grasp of ice and fangs of steel, Dimming the visual radiance pale, That soon eternal night shall veil. Oh! not for all the gold that flings, Through domes of oriental kings, Its mingled splendour, falsely bright, Would I resign youth's lovelier light. For whether wealth its path illume, Or toil and poverty depress, The days of youth are days of bloom, And health, and hope, and loveliness. Oh! were the ruthless demon, Age, Involved by Jove's tempestuous rage, And fast and far to ruin driven, Beyond the flaming bounds of heaven, Or whelmed where arctic winter broods O'er Ocean's frozen solitudes, So never more to haunt again The cities and the homes of men. Yet, were the gods the friends of worth, Of justice, and of truth, The virtuous and the wise on earth Should find a second youth. Then would true glory shine unfurled, A light to guide and guard the world, If, not in vain with time at strife, The good twice ran the race of life, While vice, to one brief course confined, Should wake no more to curse mankind. Experience then might rightly trace The lines that part the good and base, As sailors read the stars of night, Where shoreless billows murmuring roll, And guide by their unerring light The vessel to its distant goal. But, since no signs from Jove declare That earthly virtue claims his care; Since folly, vice, and falsehood prove As many marks of heavenly love; The life of man in darkness flies; The thirst of truth and wisdom dies; And love and beauty bow the knee To gold's supreme divinity. PHÆDRA AND NURSE. ? ???? ?????? ???????? ?? ?????. Euripides: Hippolytus. Nurse Oh ills of life! relentless train Of sickness, tears, and wasting pain! Where shall I turn? what succour claim To warm with health thy failing frame? Thy couch, by which so long we mourn, Forth from the palace doors is borne: Turn on these scenes thy languid sight, That breathe of life, and smile in light. But now thy every wish was given To draw the ethereal breeze of heaven: Soon will thy fancy's wandering train Recall the chamber's gloom again. Charmless all present objects seem: The absent fill thy feverish dream: Thy half-formed thoughts new thoughts destroy, Nor leave one transient pause of joy. Yet better feel the sharpest pains, That rend the nerves and scorch the veins, Than the long watch of misery prove By the sick couch of those we love. In the worst pangs to sickness known Corporeal sufferance reigns alone; The double pangs our vigils share Of manual toil and mental care. The days of man in misery flow: No rest from toils and tears we know: The happier slumbers of the tomb Are wrapped in clouds, and veiled in gloom. And hence our abject spirits shrink From pressing that oblivious brink, Still fondly lingering to survey The radiance of terrestrial day, Through fear that fate's unpitying breath May burst the deep repose of death, And ignorance of those paths of dread Which no returning step may tread. We trace the mystic legends old That many a dreaming bard has told, And hear, half-doubting, half-deceived, The songs our simpler sires believed. Phædra Give me your hands. My strength has fled. Uplift my frame. Support my head. Unclasp the bands that bind my hair, A weight I have not power to bear, And let my loosened tresses flow Freely on all the winds that blow. Nurse My child, let hope thy bosom warm: Convulse not thus thy sickly form: Thy mind let tranquil virtue steel To bear the ills that all must feel, Since human wisdom shuns in vain The sad necessity of pain. Phædra Oh place me in some flowery glade, Beneath the poplar's murmuring shade, Where many a dewy fountain flings The treasures of its crystal springs: There let me draw, in transient rest, A draught to cool my burning breast. Nurse Alas! what words are these, my child? Oh breathe not strains so sadly wild, That seem with phrensy's tints imbued, Before the listening multitude. Phædra Oh! bear me to those heights divine, Where wild winds bend the mountain-pine, Where to the dog's melodious cry The rocks and caverned glens reply. By heaven, I long to grasp the spear, Hang on the track of flying deer, Shout to the dogs, as fast we sweep Tumultuous down the sylvan steep, And hurl along the tainted air The javelin from my streaming hair. Nurse Alas! what may these visions be? What are the dogs and woods to thee? Why is it thus thy fancy roves To lonely springs and cypress groves, When here the hanging rock distills Its everlasting crystal rills? Phædra Goddess of Limna's sandy bounds, Where many a courser's hoof resounds! Would I were on thy field of fame, Conspicuous in the equestrian game. Nurse Still from thy lips such strains depart, As thrill with pain my aged heart. Now on the mountain-heights afar You long to urge the sylvan war; Now on the billow-bordering sand To guide the rein with desperate hand. What gifted mind's mysterious skill Shall say whence springs thy secret ill? For sure some god's malignant sway Turns thee from reason's paths away. Phædra Where has my darkened fancy strayed? What has my rash delirium said? How lost, alas! how fallen am I Beneath some adverse deity! Nurse, veil my head. The dream is past. My mournful eyes on earth I cast: The thoughts I breathed my memory rend, And tears of grief and shame descend. Sad is the change when reason's light Bursts on the waste of mental night. Severe the pangs of phrensy's hour: But, when we feel its scorpion power, Oh might the illusion never fly! For 'twere some blessing so to die, Ere yet returning sense could shew The dire reality of woe. Nurse I veil thee.. When shall death so spread His veil around my weary head? Truths, oft by sages sought in vain, Long life and sad experience gain. Let not the children of mankind Affection's bonds too closely bind, But let the heart unshackled prove The links of dissoluble love. Loose be those links, and lightly held; With ease compressed, with ease repelled; More tender ties the health destroy, And bring long grief for transient joy. Ill may one feeble spirit bear, When double feelings claim its care, The pangs that in the heart concur, Such pangs, as now I feel for her. For love, like riches, in excess, Has more the power to curse than bless: And wisdom turns from passion's strife, To seek the golden mean of life. CHORAL ODE TO LOVE. ???? ???? ? ???? ???????. Euripides: Hippolytus. Strophe I Oh Love! oh Love! whose shafts of fire Invade the soul with sweet surprise, Through the soft dews of young desire Trembling in beauty's azure eyes! Condemn not me the pangs to share Thy too impassioned votaries bear, That on the mind their stamp impress Indelible and measureless. For not the sun's descending dart, Nor yet the lightning-brand of Jove, Fall like the shaft that strikes the heart, Thrown by the mightier hand of love. Antistrophe I Oh! vainly, where, by Letrian plains, Tow'rd Dian's dome Alphëus bends, And from Apollo's Pythian fanes, The steam of hecatombs ascends: While not to love our altars blaze: To love, whose tyrant power arrays Against mankind each form of woe That hopeless anguish bleeds to know: To love, who keeps the golden key, That, when more favored lips implore, Unlocks the sacred mystery Of youthful beauty's bridal door. Strophe II Alas! round love's despotic power Their brands what forms of terror wave! The Œchalian maid, in evil hour, Venus to great Alcides gave. As yet in passion's lore unread, Unconscious of connubial ties, She saw around her bridal bed Her native city's flames arise. Ah hapless maid! mid kindred gore Whose nuptial torch the Furies bore: To him consigned, an ill-starred bride, By whom her sire and brethren died. Antistrophe II Oh towers of Thebes! oh sacred flow Of mystic Dirce's fountain-tides! Say, in what shapes of fear and woe Love through his victim's bosom glides! She, who to heaven's imperial sire The care-dispelling Bacchus bore, Mid thunder and celestial fire Embraced, and slept to wake no more. Too powerful love, inspiring still The dangerous wish, the frantic will, Bears, like the bee's mellifluous wing, A transient sweet, a lasting sting. CONNUBIAL EQUALITY ? ?????, ? ????? ??. Æschylus: Prometheus. Oh! wise was he, the first who taught This lesson of observant thought, That equal fates alone may dress The bowers of nuptial happiness; That never, where ancestral pride Inflames, or affluence rolls its tide, Should love's ill-omened bonds entwine The offspring of an humbler line. CHORAL ODE ON THE EVILS OF LIFE ????? ??? ??????? ??????. Sophocles: Œdipus at Colonos. Alas! that thirst of wealth and power Should pass the bounds by wisdom laid, And shun Contentment's mountain-bower, To chase a false and fleeting shade! The torrid orb of summer shrouds Its head in darker, stormier clouds, Than quenched its vernal glow: And streams, that meet the expanding sea, Resign the peace and purity, That marked their infant flow. Go, seek what joys, serene and deep, The paths of wealth and power supply! The eyes no balmy slumbers steep, The lips own no satiety, Till, where unpitying Pluto dwells, And where the turbid Styx impels Its circling waves along, The pale ghost treads the flowerless shore, And hears the unblest sisters pour Their loveless, lyreless song. Man's happiest lot is not to be: And, when we tread life's thorny steep, Most blest are they, who, earliest free, Descend to death's eternal sleep. From wisdom far, and peace, and truth, Imprudence leads the steps of youth, Where ceaseless evils spring: Toil, frantic passion, deadly strife, Revenge, and murder's secret knife, And envy's scorpion sting. Age comes—unloved, unsocial age,— Exposed to fate's severest shock, As to the ocean-tempest's rage The bleak and billow-beaten rock. There ills on ills commingling press: Morose, unjoying helplessness, And pain, and slow disease: As, when the storm of winter raves, The wild winds rush from all their caves To swell the northern seas. “OH BLEST ARE THEY, AND THEY ALONE” Oh blest are they, and they alone, To fame to wealth to power unknown; Whose lives in one perpetual tenor glide, Nor feel one influence of malignant fate: For when the gods on mortals frown They pour no single vengeance down, But scatter ruin vast and wide On all the race they hate. Then ill on ill succeeding still, With unrelaxing fury pours, As wave on wave the breakers rave Tumultuous on the wreck-strown shores, When northern tempests sweep The wild and wintry deep, Uprending from its depths the sable sand, Which blackening eddies whirl, And crested surges hurl Against the rocky bulwarks of the land, While to the tumult, deepening round, The repercussive caves resound. LAW OF NECESSITY In solitary pride, By Dirce's murmuring side, The giant oak has stretched its ample shade, And waved its tresses of imperial might; Now low in dust its blackened boughs are laid, Its dark root withers in the depth of night. Nor hoarded gold, nor pomp of martial power Can check necessity's supreme control, That cleaves unerringly the rock-built tower, And whelms the flying bark where shoreless oceans roll. AL MIO PRIMIERO AMORE To many a shrine my steps have strayed, Ne'er from their earliest fetters free: And I have sighed to many a maid, Though I have never loved but thee. Youth's visioned scenes, too bright to last, Have vanished to return no more: Yet memory loves to trace the past, Which only memory can restore. The confidence, no heart has felt But when with first illusions warm, The hope, on one alone that dwelt, The thought, that knew no second form,— All these were ours: and can it be That their return may charm us yet? Can aught remain to thee and me, Beyond remembrance and regret? For now thy sweetest smiles appear Like shades of joys for ever flown, As music in an exile's ear Recalls the strains his home has known. No more can bloom the faded flower: No more the extinguished fire can burn: Nor hope nor fancy's mightiest power Can burst young love's sepulchral urn. LINES TO A FAVOURITE LAUREL IN THE GARDEN AT ANKERWYKE COTTAGE How changed this lonely scene! the rank weed chokes The garden flowers: the thistle's towering growth Waves o'er the untrodden paths: the rose that breathed Diffusive fragrance from its christening bed, Scarce by a single bud denotes the spot Where glowed its countless bloom: the woodbine droops And trails along the ground, and wreathes no more Around the light verandah's pillared shade The tendrils of its sweetness: the green shrubs, That made even winter gay, have felt themselves The power of change, and mournful is the sound Of evening's twilight gale, that shrilly sweeps Their brown and sapless leaves. But thou remain'st Unaltered save in beauty: thou alone, Amid neglect and desolation, spread'st The rich luxuriance of thy foliage still, More rich and more luxuriant now, than when, Mid all the gay parterre, I called thee first My favourite laurel: and 'tis something yet, Even in this world where Ahrimanes reigns To think that thou, my favourite, hast been left Unharmed amid the inclemency of time, While all around thee withered. Lovely tree! There is a solemn aspect in thy shade, A mystic whisper in the evening gale, That murmurs through thy boughs; it breathes of peace, Of rest, to one, who, having trodden long The thorny paths of this malignant world, Full fain would make the moss that tufts thy root The pillow of his slumber. Many a bard, Beneath some favourite tree, oak, beech, or pine, Has by the pensive music of the breeze, Been soothed to transient rest: but thou canst shed A mightier spell: the murmur of thy leaves Is full of meaning; and their influence, Accessible to resolution, yields No evanescent balm, but pours at once Through all the sufferer's frame, the sweetest sleep The weary pilgrim of the earth can know: The long, oblivious, everlasting sleep Of that last night on which no morn shall rise. PROLOGUE TO MR. TOBIN'S COMEDY OF THE GUARDIANS, PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, DRURY LANE, NOVEMBER, 1816 Spoken by Mr. ? Beyond the hopes and fears of earlier days, The frowns of censure and the smiles of praise, Is he, the bard, on whose untimely tomb, Your favour bade the Thespian laurel bloom; Though late the meed that crowned his minstrel strain, It has not died, and was not given in vain. If now our hopes one more memorial rear, To blend with those that live unwithering here; If on that tomb where genius sleeps in night, One flower expands to bloom in lingering light, Flower of a stem which no returning spring Shall clothe anew with buds and blossoming; Oh! yet again the votive wreath allow To grace his name which cannot bind his brow; And, while our tale the scenic maze pursues, Still prove kind Guardians to his orphan muse. EPILOGUE TO THE COMEDY OF THE GUARDIANS Spoken by Mr. Harley in the character of Hint At home, abroad, in gossip, or in print, Who has not felt the magic power of Hint? Say, lovely maid, what earthly power can move That gentle bosom like a hint of love? Say, thou spruce beau, oppressed with loads of raiment, What half so shocking as a hint for payment? A hint of need, drawn forth with sad concessions, Stops the full flow of friendship's loud professions: A hint of Hyde Park Ring from testy humours, Stops Hint itself, when most agog for rumours. Where'er I go, beaux, belles of all degrees, Come buzzing round me like a swarm of bees: My crafty hook of sly insinuation I bait with hints, and fish for information. “What news, dear Hint? it does us good to see Your pleasant face: we're dying with ennui.” “Me! bless you! I know nothing.” “You're so sly; You've something in your head:” “Indeed not I. 'Tis true, at Lady Rook's, just now I heard A whisper pass. . . . I don't believe a word A certain lady is not over blameless, Touching a certain lord that shall be nameless.” “Who? who? pray tell.” “Excuse me.” “Nay, you shall.” (In different voices) “You mean my Lady Plume and Lord Fal-lal,” “Lord Smirk and Mrs. Sparkle,” “Lady Simple, And young Lord Froth,” “Lord Whip and Mrs. Dimple.” (In an Irish accent) “D'ye mean my wife, sir? give me leave to mention There's no ill meaning in Lord Sly's attention: Sir, there's my card: command me: I'll attend, And talk the matter over with a friend.” “Dear Major! no such thing: you're right in scorning Such idle tales: I wish you a good-morning.” Away I speed: from lounge to lounge I run, With five tales loaded where I fished for one; And, entre nous, take care the town shall know, The Major's wife is not quite comme il faut. But Hyde Park Ring my cunning shuns in vain, If by your frowns I die in Drury Lane. If die I must, think not I'll tamely fall: Pit, boxes, gallery, thus I challenge all. Ye critics near me, and ye gods afar! Fair maid, spruce beau, plump cit, and jovial tar! Come one and all, roused by my valorous greeting, To-morrow night to give bold Hint the meeting: Bring all your friends—a host—I'll fit them nicely, Place—Drury Lane—time, half-past-six precisely. “FROM TEN TO ELEVEN” From ten to eleven, ate a breakfast for seven: From eleven to noon, to begin 'twas too soon; From twelve to one, asked, “What's to be done?” From one to two, found nothing to do; From two to three began to foresee That from three to four would be a damned bore. A BILL FOR THE BETTER PROMOTION OF OPPRESSION ON THE SABBATH DAY Forasmuch as the Canter's and Fanatic's Lord Sayeth peace and joy are by me abhorred; And would fill each Sunday with gloom and pain For all too poor his regard to obtain; And forasmuch as the laws heretofore Have not sufficiently squeezed the poor; Be it therefore enacted by Commons, King And Lords, a crime for any thing To be done on the Sabbath by any rank Excepting the rich. No beer may be drank, Food eaten, rest taken, away from home, And each House shall a Sunday prison become; And spies and jailers must carefully see, Under severest penalty, None stirs but to conventicle, Thrice a day at toll of bell. And each sickly cit who dare engage His place by steamer, fly or stage, With owner thereof shall by this said bill, Be punished with fine, imprisonment or treadmill. But nothing herein is designed to discourage Priest, noble or squire from the use of his carriage. No ship shall move however it blow, The Devil a bit shall said ship go Whether the winds will let it or no; And, as winds and weather we cannot imprison, Owners, Captain and sailors we therefore shall seize on, And whereas oxen, lambs and sheep About the roads and lanes will creep, And cocks and hens and ducks and geese Will not on Sunday hold their peace, Be it enacted that foresaid beasts, If not belonging to gentry or priests, Be caught and whipped and pounded on Sunday, And sold to pay expences on Monday. The drunkard, who paid five shillings before, Shall now pay twenty shillings more, And mine host, if on Sabbath he dare unloose A bolt, shall be fined and his license lose. All oranges, cakes &amp; lollypop Shall be seized; &amp; every open shop Shall be fined a pound an hour till it stop. Till nine the milkman may ply his trade, For pious breakfasts must be made At the risk of his soul. And the Bakers at last, When the poor man's dinner is clearly past, Must set to work, the godly scorning Stale rolls and bread on a Monday morning. That Justices may have less to do, 'Tis enacted they may convict on view, And shall, if they think the course more drastic, Transfer to Courts Ecclesiastic. All informers shall pass scot free, However false their averments may be; And witnesses who have no mind To convict shall be imprisoned and fined. And whereas from this act's operation Are exempted the following ranks in this nation: The rich man's servants; they cannot be spared (In spite of the Scripture) from working hard; Milkmen in the morning; at evening the bakers, With Constables, Doctors, thieves, parsons, toll-takers; And parties for music, gambling or dinners Are hereby exempt, when the rich are the sinners; For no party whatever has aught to fear From said act who has more than £500 a year. MARGARET LOVE PEACOCK Long night succeeds thy little day; Oh blighted blossom! can it be, That this grey stone, and grassy clay, Have clos'd our anxious care of thee? The half-form'd speech of artless thought, That spoke a mind beyond thy years; The song, the dance, by nature taught; The sunny smiles, the transient tears; The symmetry of face and form, The eye with light and life replete; The little heart so fondly warm, The voice so musically sweet; These, lost to hope, in memory yet Around the hearts that lov'd thee cling, Shadowing, with long and vain regret, The too fair promise of thy spring. TRANSLATION OF AN INSCRIPTION PLACED UNDER THE FIRST STONE OF THE LONDON-UNIVERSITY By the favor of God, the great builder of earth, (Which favor we hope may be found of some worth,) This stone, in the ground with due mystery laid, By a Prince of the Masons' original trade, A Prince whom the provident bounty of God Expressly cut out for a Knight of the hod, Midst citizens, noisy with hand and with voice, Who, we clearly foresee, will be there to rejoice, Begins, at length, somehow, at some time or other, A good job for this town, and each lecturing brother, And makes record more lasting than pencil or pen Of us twenty five most illustrious men, Including our builder, who stands in his place As just one of us, in the Nominative Case. “OH NOSE OF WAX! TRUE SYMBOL OF THE MIND” Oh nose of wax! true symbol of the mind Which fate and fortune mould in all mankind (Even as the hand moulds thee) to foul or fair:— Thee good John Bull for his device shall bear, While Sawney Scot the ductile mass shall mould, Bestowing paper and receiving gold. Thy image, shrined in studious state severe, Shall grace the pile which Brougham and Campbell rear: Thy name to those scholastic bowers shall pass, And rival Oxford's ancient nose of brass. TOUCHANDGO Hoho! hoho! pray who can show Whither has fled great Touchandgo? He's gone off in a chaise and pair, And not a man on earth knows where. In his own chariot off he ran, And there was not a turnpike man, 'Twixt London and the Western Channel, Could see his arms upon the pannel. Some say he took the road to Bristol, Equipped with sixpence and a pistol; Some say with gold he's well apparelled, And blunderbusses double-barrelled: Others affirm, he strove to pop His brains out in my uncle's shop, And, missing fire, set off to Milford, With lots of sovereigns which he pilfered: Some say he beat about all Sunday, I' th' wind's eye, off the Isle of Lundy, Showered on the Pilots gold, like manna, And then was shipped off for Savannah. Others aver he still doth dwell Deep in a fishing-vessel's well, And there, chin-deep, in Milford Haven, Takes cold, and croaks like any raven; They add, his Assignees' Attorney Has waited on Sir Richard Birnie, With a request that Mr. Bishop Him, from said fishing-smack, may fish up. Some say a fleet has just weighed anchor, To chace the flying Clerk and Banker, With picked men, guns and carronades, To take, or sink, or burn the blades. Well done! Britannia rules the waves! A fleet to catch one brace of knaves! Thus paper-coinage sets in motion All England and the Atlantic Ocean. Now, hark! away, ye Bow-street runners; Whistle, ye boatswains—swear, ye gunners; Spread all your canvas, seamen loyal, Gib, studd'n sail, and top-gallant-royal. Jack Tar has found a worthy foe To chace in mighty Touchandgo— Who'll back the “Victory” 'gainst the “Funny?” Huzza! St. George and Paper-money! A SPEECH IN EMBRYO My Lords, as I'm a man veracious, I had a word or two to say Which were exceedingly sagacious; But, I protest, they've flown away. 'Tis sure the greatest of all hardships, And proves some spell is round me spread, That barely looking at your Lordships Drives all ideas from my head. My ‘winged words,’ in regions airy, Just now are hovering out of reach; I'll catch my stray vocabulary, And then, my Lords, I'll make a speech. “WHEN JOHN OF ZISCA WENT TO KINGDOM COME” When John of Zisca went to Kingdom come He left his skin to make his Church a drum, To sound a rub-a-dub for Reformation, To beat a general muster to Salvation. So Winchelsea, who soon will be no more, Between two fires, Guy Fawkes and Scarlet Whore, To Bigots of all ages and Conditions Shall leave his noble Sheep-skin for Petitions. THE LEGEND OF MANOR HALL Old Farmer Wall, of Manor Hall, To market drove his wain: Along the road it went well stowed With sacks of golden grain. His station he took, but in vain did he look For a customer all the morn; Though the farmers all, save Farmer Wall, They sold off all their corn. Then home he went, sore discontent, And many an oath he swore, And he kicked up rows with his children and spouse, When they met him at the door. Next market-day, he drove away To the town his loaded wain: The farmers all, save Farmer Wall, They sold off their grain. No bidder he found, and he stood astound At the close of the market-day, When the market was done, and the chapmen were gone Each man his several way. He stalked by his load along the road; His face with wrath was red: His arms he tossed, like a goodman crossed In seeking his daily bread. His face was red, and fierce was his tread, And with lusty voice cried he: “My corn I'll sell to the devil of hell, If he'll my chapman be.” These words he spoke just under an oak Seven hundred winters old; And he straight was aware of a man sitting there On the roots and grassy mould. The roots rose high o'er the green-sward dry, And the grass around was green, Save just the space of the stranger's place, Where it seemed as fire had been. All scorched was the spot, as gipsy-pot Had swung and bubbled there: The grass was marred, the roots were charred, And the ivy stems were bare. The stranger up-sprung: to the farmer he flung A loud and friendly hail, And he said, “I see well, thou hast corn to sell, And I'll buy it on the nail.” The twain in a trice agreed on the price; The stranger his earnest paid, And with horses and wain to come for the grain His own appointment made. The farmer cracked his whip, and tracked His way right merrily on: He struck up a song, as he trudged along, For joy that his job was done. His children fair he danced in the air; His heart with joy was big; He kissed his wife; he seized a knife, He slew a sucking pig. The faggots burned, the porkling turned And crackled before the fire; And an odour arose, that was sweet in the nose Of a passing ghostly friar. He tirled at the pin, he entered in, He sate down at the board; The pig he blessed, when he saw it well dressed, And the humming ale out-poured. The friar laughed, the friar quaffed, He chirped like a bird in May; The farmer told how his corn he had sold As he journeyed home that day. The friar he quaffed, but no longer he laughed, He changed from red to pale: “Oh, hapless elf! 'tis the fiend himself To whom thou hast made thy sale!” The friar he quaffed, he took a deep draught; He crossed himself amain: “Oh, slave of pelf! 'tis the devil himself To whom thou hast sold thy grain! And sure as the day, he'll fetch thee away, With the corn which thou hast sold, If thou let him pay o'er one tester more Than thy settled price in gold.” The farmer gave vent to a loud lament, The wife to a long outcry; Their relish for pig and ale was flown; The friar alone picked every bone, And drained the flagon dry. The friar was gone: the morning dawn Appeared, and the stranger's wain Came to the hour, with six-horse power, To fetch the purchased grain. The horses were black: on their dewy track Light steam from the ground up-curled; Long wreaths of smoke from their nostrils broke, And their tails like torches whirled. More dark and grim, in face and limb, Seemed the stranger than before, As his empty wain, with steeds thrice twain, Drew up to the farmer's door. On the stranger's face was a sly grimace, As he seized the sacks of grain; And, one by one, till left were none, He tossed them on the wain. And slily he leered, as his hand up-reared A purse of costly mould, Where, bright and fresh, through a silver mesh, Shone forth the glistering gold. The farmer held out his right hand stout, And drew it back with dread; For in fancy he heard each warning word The supping friar had said. His eye was set on the silver net; His thoughts were in fearful strife; When, sudden as fate, the glittering bait Was snatched by his loving wife. And, swift as thought, the stranger caught The farmer his waist around, And at once the twain and the loaded wain Sank through the rifted ground. The gable-end wall of Manor Hall Fell in ruins on the place: That stone-heap old the tale has told To each succeeding race. The wife gave a cry that rent the sky At her goodman's downward flight: But she held the purse fast, and a glance she cast To see that all was right. 'Twas the fiend's full pay for her goodman grey, And the gold was good and true; Which made her declare, that “his dealings were fair, To give the devil his due.” She wore the black pall for Farmer Wall, From her fond embraces riven: But she won the vows of a younger spouse With the gold which the fiend had given. Now, farmers, beware what oaths you swear When you cannot sell your corn; Lest, to bid and buy, a stranger be nigh, With hidden tail and horn. And, with good heed, the moral a-read, Which is of this tale the pith, If your corn you sell to the fiend of hell, You may sell yourself therewith. And if by mishap you fall in the trap,— Would you bring the fiend to shame, Lest the tempting prize should dazzle her eyes, Lock up your frugal dame. THE NEW YEAR LINES ON GEORGE CRUIKSHANK'S ILLUSTRATION OF JANUARY, IN THE COMIC ALMANACK FOR 1838 A great philosopher art thou, George Cruikshank, In thy unmatched grotesqueness! Antic dance, Wine, mirth, and music, welcome thy New Year, Who makes her entry as a radiant child, With smiling face, in holiday apparel, Bearing a cornucopiæ, crowned and clustered With all the elements of festal joy: All smiles and promises. But looking closely Upon that smiling face, 'tis but a mask; Fitted so well, it almost seems a face; But still a mask. What features lurk beneath, The rolling months will show. Thy Old Year passes,— Danced out in mockery by the festive band,— A faded form, with thin and pallid face, In spectral weeds; her mask upon the ground, Her Amalthæa's horn reversed, and emptied Of all good things,—not even hope remaining. Such will the New Year be: that smiling mask Will fall; to some how soon: to many later: At last to all! The same transparent shade Of wasted means and broken promises Will make its exit: and another Year Will enter masked and smiling, and be welcomed With minstrelsy and revelry, as this is. NEWARK ABBEY AUGUST, 1842 WITH A REMINISCENCE OF AUGUST, 1807 I gaze, where August's sunbeam falls Along these gray and lonely walls, Till in its light absorbed appears The lapse of five-and-thirty years. If change there be, I trace it not In all this consecrated spot: No new imprint of Ruin's march On roofless wall and frameless arch: The hills, the woods, the fields, the stream, Are basking in the self-same beam: The fall, that turns the unseen mill, As then it murmured, murmurs still: It seems, as if in one were cast The present and the imaged past, Spanning, as with a bridge sublime, That awful lapse of human time, That gulph, unfathomably spread Between the living and the dead. For all too well my spirit feels The only change this scene reveals: The sunbeams play, the breezes stir, Unseen, unfelt, unheard by her, Who, on that long-past August day, First saw with me these ruins gray. Whatever span the Fates allow, Ere I shall be as she is now, Still in my bosom's inmost cell Shall that deep-treasured memory dwell: That, more than language can express, Pure miracle of loveliness, Whose voice so sweet, whose eyes so bright, Were my soul's music, and its light, In those blest days, when life was new, And hope was false, but love was true. LINES ON THE DEATH OF JULIA LORD BROUGHTON'S ELDEST DAUGHTER, 1849 Accept, bright spirit, reft in life's best bloom, This votive wreath to thy untimely tomb. Formed to adorn all scenes, and charm in all, The fire-side circle, and the courtly hall; Thy friends to gladden, and thy home to bless;— Fair form thou hadst, and grace, and graciousness; A mind that sought, a tongue that spoke, the truth, And thought mature beneath the smiles of youth. Dear, dear young friend! ingenuous, cordial heart! And can it be, that thou shouldst first depart? That age should sorrow o'er thy youthful shrine? It owns more near, more sacred griefs than mine; Yet, midst the many who thy loss deplore, Few loved thee better, and few mourn thee more. A GOODLYE BALLADE OF LITTLE JOHN SHEWINGE HOW HE RAYSED A DYVELL, AND HOW HE COULDE NOTTE LAYE HYMME Fytte the First Little John he sat in a lordly hall, Mid spoils of the Church of old: And he saw a shadowing on the wall, That made his blood run cold. He saw the dawn of a coming day, Dim-glimmering through the gloom: He saw the coronet pass away From the ancient halls where it then held sway, And the mitre its place resume. He saw, the while, through the holy pile The incense vapour spread; He saw the poor, at the Abbey door, Receiving their daily bread. He saw on the wall the shadows cast Of sacred sisters three: He blessed them not, as they flitted past: But above them all he hated the last, For that was Charitie. Now down from its shelf a book he bore, And characters he drew, And a spell he muttered o'er and o'er, Till before him cleft was the marble floor, And a murky fiend came through. “Now take thee a torch in thy red right hand,” Little John to the fiend he saith: “And let it serve as a signal brand, To raise the rabble, throughout the land, Against the Catholic Faith.” Straight through the porch, with brandished torch, The fiend went joyously out: And a posse of parsons, established by law, Sprang up, when the lurid flame they saw, To head the rabble rout. And braw Scots Presbyters nimbly sped In the train of the muckle black de'il; And, as the wild infection spread, The Protestant Hydra's every head Sent forth a yell of zeal. And pell-mell went all forms of dissent, Each beating its scriptural drum; Wesleyans and Whitfieldites followed as friends, And whatever in 'onian and 'arian ends, Et omne quod exit in hum. And in bonfires burned ten thousand Guys, With caricatures of the pious and wise, Mid shouts of goblin glee, And such a clamour rent the skies, That all buried lunatics seemed to rise, And hold a Jubilee. Fytte the Second The devil gave the rabble scope And they left him not in the lurch: But they went beyond the summoner's hope; For they quickly got tired of bawling “No Pope!” And bellowed, “No State Church!” “Ho!” quoth Little John, “this must not be: The devil leads all amiss: He works for himself, and not for me: And straightway back I'll bid him flee To the bottomless abyss.” Again he took down his book from the wall, And pondered words of might: He muttered a speech, and he scribbled a scrawl: But the only answer to his call Was a glimpse, at the uttermost end of the hall, Of the devil taking a sight. And louder and louder grew the clang As the rabble raged without: The door was beaten with many a bang; And the vaulted roof re-echoing rang To the tumult and the shout. The fiendish shade, on the wall portrayed, Threw somersaults fast and free, And flourished his tail like a brandished flail, As busy as if it were blowing a gale, And his task were on the sea. And up he toss't his huge pitchfork, As visioned shrines uprose; And right and left he went to work, Till full over Durham, and Oxford, and York, He stood with a menacing pose. The rabble roar was hushed awhile, As the hurricane rests in its sweep; And all throughout the ample pile Reigned silence dread and deep. Then a thrilling voice cried: “Little John, A little spell will do, When there is mischief to be done, To raise me up and set me on; For I, of my own free will, am won To carry such spiritings through. “But when I am riding the tempest's wing, And towers and spires have blazed, 'Tis no small conjuror's art to sing, Or say, a spell to check the swing Of the demons he has raised.” IN REMEMBRANCE OF FORTY-FOUR YEARS AGO The convolvulus twines round the stems of its bower, And spreads its young blossoms to morning's first ray: But the noon has scarce past, when it folds up its flower, Which opens no more to the splendour of day. So twine round the heart, in the light of life's morning, Love's coils of green promise and bright purple bloom: The noontide goes by, and the colours, adorning Its unfulfilled dreamings, are wrapt up in gloom. But press the fresh flower, while its charms are yet glowing, Its colour and form through long years will remain: And treasured in memory, thus love is still showing The outlines of hope, which else blossomed in vain. “THE BRIEFEST PART OF LIFE'S UNCERTAIN DAY” The briefest part of life's uncertain day, Youth's lovely blossom, hastes to swift decay: While love, wine, song, enhance our gayest mood, Old Age creeps on, nor thought, nor understood. LETTER TO LORD BROUGHTON Old friend, whose rhymes so kindly mix Thoughts grave and gay with seventy-six, I hope it may to you be given To do the same at seventy-seven; Whence your still living friends may date A new good wish for seventy-eight; And thence again extend the line, Until it passes seventy-nine; And yet again, and yet again, While health and cheerfulness remain. Long be they yours, for, blest with these, Life's latest years have power to please, And round them spread the genial glow Which sunset casts on Alpine snow. “INSTEAD OF SITTING WRAPPED UP IN FLANNEL” Instead of sitting wrapped up in flannel With rheumatism in every joint, I wish I was in the English Channel, Just going round the Lizard Point, All southward bound, with the seas before me, I should not care whether smooth or rough, For then no visitors would call to bore me, Of whose “good-mornings” I have had enough. CASTLES IN THE AIR My thoughts by night are often filled With visions false as fair: For in the past alone I build My castles in the air. I dwell not now on what may be: Night shadows o'er the scene: But still my fancy wanders free Through that which might have been. AHRIMANES AND Other Verse Fragments AHRIMANES Canto the First The devil is come upon the earth with great power. ?? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ?? ???? ????, ????? ?????? ???? ??? ????, ???? ????????, ?? ???????. ????????. Man's happiest lot is not to be: And when we tread life's thorny steep, Most blest are they, who, earliest free, Descend to death's eternal sleep. I In silver eddies glittering to the moon, Araxes rolls his many-sounding tide. Fair as the dreams of hope, and past as soon, But in succession infinite supplied, The rapid waters musically glide. Now, where the cliff's phantastic shadow laves, Silent and dark, they roll their volumed pride: Now, by embowering woods and solemn caves, Around some jutting rock the struggling torrent raves. II Darassah stands beside the lonely shore, Intently gazing on the imaged beam, As one whose steps each lonely haunt explore Of nymph or naiad,—grove, or rock, or stream— Nature his guide, his object, and his theme. Ah no—Darassah's eyes these forms survey As phantoms of a half-remembered dream: His eyes are on the water's glittering play: Their mental sense is closed—his thoughts are far away. III But central in the flood of liquid light, A sudden spot its widening orb revealed, Jet-black amid the mirrored beams of night, Jet-black, and round as Celtic warrior's shield, A sable circle in a silver field. With sense recalled and motionless surprise, Deeming some fearful mystery there concealed, He marked that shadowy orb's expanding size, Till slowly from its breast a form began to rise— IV A female form: and even as marble pale Her cheeks: her eyes unearthly fire illumed: Far o'er her shoulders streamed a sable veil, Where flowers of living flame inwoven bloomed; No mortal robe might bear them unconsumed: A crown her temples bound: on such ne'er gazed Eyes that had seen primeval kings entombed: Twelve points it bore: on every point upraised A star—a heavenly star—with dazzling radiance blazed. V Lovely she was—not loveliness that might In mortal heart enkindle light desire— But such as decked the form of youthful Night, When, on the bosom of her anarch sire, With gentler passion she did first inspire The gloomy soul of Erebus severe; Ere from her breast, on wings of golden fire, Primordial love sprang o'er the infant sphere, And bade young Time arise and lead the vernal year. VI Her right hand held a wand, whose potent sway Her liquid path, the buoyant waves, obeyed. Still as she moved, the moon-beams died away, And shade around her fell—a circling shade— That gave no outline of the wondrous maid. Her form—soft-gliding as the summer gale— In that portentous darkness shone arrayed, Shone by her starry crown, her fiery veil, And those refulgent eyes that made their radiance pale. VII “Why—simple dweller of the Araxian isle—” Thus, as she pressed the shore, the genius said— “Seek'st thou this spot, to muse and mourn the while, Beside this river's ever-murmuring bed, When gentle sleep has her dominion spread On every living thing around, but thee? The silent stars, that twinkle o'er thy head, Shed rest and peace on hill, and flower, and tree; All but the eternal stream, that flows melodiously.” VIII Solemn her voice, as music's vesper peal From distant choir to cloistered echo borne, Where the deep notes through pillared twilight steal, Breathing tranquillity to souls that mourn. The awe-struck youth replied: “Of one so lorn Canst thou, empyreal spirit, deign require The secret woes by which his soul is torn? Sure from the fountain of eternal fire Thy wondrous birth began, great Mithra's self thy sire. IX “Through many an age amid these island-bowers The simple fathers of our race have dwelt: To them spontaneous nature fruits and flowers, By toil unsought, with partial bounty dealt: At Oromazes' sylvan shrine they knelt: And morn and eve did choral suppliance flow From hearts that love and mingled reverence felt, To him who gave them every bliss to know That simple hearts can wish, or heavenly love bestow. X “But years passed on, and strange perversion ran Among the dwellers of the peaceful isle: And one, more daring than the rest, began To fell the grove, and point the massy pile; And raised the circling fence, with evil wile, And to his brethren said: These bounds are mine: And did with living victims first defile The verdant turf of Oromazes' shrine; Sad offering sure, and strange, to mercy's source divine. XI “And ill example evil followers drew; Till common good and common right were made The fraudful tenure of a powerful few: The many murmured, trembled, and obeyed. Then peace and freedom fled the sylvan shade, And care arose, and toil, unknown before: And some the hallowed alder's trunk essayed, And left, with tearful eyes, their natal shore. Swift down the stream they went, and they returned no more. XII “And I too, oft, beyond that barrier rock, That hides from view the river's onward way— Where, eddying round its base with ceaseless shock, The waves, that flash, and disappear for aye, Their parting murmurs to my ear convey— In fancy turn my meditative gaze, And trace, encircled by their powerful sway, Some blooming isle, where love unfettered strays, And peace and freedom dwell, as here in earlier days. XIII “But one there is, for whom my tears are shed; A maid of wealthier lot and prouder line: With her my happy infant hours I led; And sweet our mutual task, at morn to twine The votive wreath round Oromazes' shrine.— She mourns, a captive in her father's home— Alone I rove, to murmur and repine— Alone, where sparkling waves symphonious foam, I breathe my secret pangs to heaven's empyreal dome.—” XIV “Leave tears to slaves”—the genius answering said— “Adventurous deed the noble mind beseems. Oh shame to manhood! thus, with listless tread, In tears and sighs and inconclusive dreams To waste thy hours by groves and murmuring streams. I bring thee power for weakness, joy for woe, And certain bliss for hope's fallacious schemes, Unless thou lightly thy own weal forego, And scorn the splendid lot thy bounteous fates bestow. XV “This gifted ring shall every barrier break: The maid thou lovest thy wandering steps shall share: When night returns, with her this isle forsake, From this my favored haunt: my guardian care To waft ye hence, the vessel shall prepare. The monarch of the world hath chosen thee High trust, and power, and dignity to bear. I come, obedient to his high decree, To set from error's spell thy captive senses free. XVI “Deem'st thou, when blood of living victims flows, Mid incense smoke, in denser volumes curled, That Oromazes there a glance bestows, A glance of joy, to see the death-blow hurled? No—far remote, in orient clouds enfurled, Nor prayer nor sacrificial rite he heeds. His reign is past: his rival rules the world. From Ahrimanes now all power proceeds: For him the altar burns: for him the victim bleeds. XVII “Parent of being, mistress of the spheres, Supreme Necessity o'er all doth reign: She guides the course of the revolving years, With power no prayers can change, no force restrain; Binding all nature in her golden chain, Whose infinite connection links afar The smallest atom of the sandy plain And the last ray of heaven's remotest star, That round the verge of space wheels its refulgent car. XVIII “She to two gods, sole agents of her will, By turns has given her delegated sway: Her sovereign laws obedient they fulfil: Inferior powers their high behests obey. First Oromazes—lord of peace and day— Dominion held o'er nature and mankind. Now Ahrimanes rules, and holds his way In storms: for such his task by her assigned, To shake the world with war, and rouse the powers of mind. XIX “She first on chaos poured the streams of light, And bade from that mysterious union rise Primordial love: the heavenly lion's might Bore him rejoicing through the new-born skies. Then glowed the infant world with countless dyes Of fruits and flowers; and virgin nature smiled, Emerging first from ancient night's disguise And elemental discord, vast and wild, Which primogenial love had charmed and reconciled. XX “Then man arose: to him the world was given, Unknowing then disease, or storm, or dearth: The eternal balance, in the central heaven, Marked the free tenure of his equal birth, And equal right to all the bounteous earth Of fruit or flower, his pristine food, might yield. Nor private roof he knew, nor blazing hearth, Nor marked with barrier-lines the fruitful field, Nor learned in martial strife the uprooted oak to wield. XXI “Then Oromazes reigned.—Profoundly calm His empire, as the lake's unruffled breast, When evening twilight melts in dews of balm, And rocks and woods in calm reflection rest, As if for aye indelibly imprest Were those fair forms, in waveless light arrayed.— No sigh, no wish, the peaceful heart confest; Save when the youth, beneath the myrtle shade, Wooed to his fond embrace the easy-yielding maid. XXII “No pillared fanes to Oromazes rose: For him no priest the destined victim led. The choral hymn, in swelling sound that flows, Where round the marble altar streaming red The slow procession moves with solemn tread, His empire owned not:—but his bounty grew, By prayer or hymn nor sought nor merited: No altar but the peaceful heart he knew— His only temple-vault, the heaven's ethereal blue. XXIII “Such was the infant world, and such the reign Of cloudless sunshine and oblivious joy; Till rose the scorpion in the empyreal plain, In fated hour, their empire to destroy, And with unwonted cares the course alloy Of mortal being and terrestrial time; That man might all his god-like powers employ The toilsome steep of wealth and fame to climb, To rugged labor trained and glory's thirst sublime. XXIV “To Ahrimanes thus devolved the power, Which still he holds through all the realms of space. He bade the sea to swell—the storm to lower— And taught mankind the pliant bow to brace, And point the shaft, and urge the sounding chace, And force from veins of flint the seeds of fire; Till, as more daring thought found gradual place, He bade the mind to nobler prey aspire, Of war and martial fame kindling the high desire. XXV “For him on earth unnumbered temples rise, And altars burn, and bleeding victims die: Albeit the sons of men his name disguise In other names, that choice or chance supply, To him alone their incense soars on high. The god of armies—the avenging god— Seeva or Allah—Jove or Mars—they cry: 'Tis Ahrimanes still that wields the rod; To him all nature bends, and trembles at his nod. XXVI “Yea, even on Oromazes' self they call, But Ahrimanes hears their secret prayer. Not in the name that from the lips may fall, But in the thought the heart's recesses bear, The sons of earth the power they serve declare. Wherever priests awake the battle-strain, And bid the torch of persecution glare, And curses ring along the vaulted fane— Call on what name they may—their god is Ahrimane. XXVII “Favor to few, to many wrath he shews: None with impunity his power may brave. Two classes only of mankind he knows, The lord and serf—the tyrant and the slave. Some hermit-sage, where lonely torrents rave, May muse and dream of Oromazes still: Despised he lives, and finds a nameless grave. The chiefs and monarchs of the world fulfil Great Ahrimane's behests—the creatures of his will. XXVIII “Say—hadst thou rather grovel with the crowd, The wretched thing and tool of lordly might, Or, where the battle-clarion brays aloud, Blaze forth conspicuous in the fields of fight, And bind thy brow with victory's chaplet bright, And be the king of men?—Thy choice is free.— Receive this ring.—Observe the coming night.— The monarch of the world hath chosen thee To spread his name on earth, in power and majesty.—” XXIX She said, and gave the ring. The youth received The glittering spell, in awe and mute amaze; Standing like one almost of sense bereaved, That fixes on the vacant air his gaze, Where wildered fancy's troubled eye surveys Dim-flitting forms, obscure and undefined, That doubtful thoughts and shadowy feelings raise, Leaving no settled image on the mind: Like cloud-built rocks and towers, dissolved ere half-combined. XXX Nor stayed she longer parle: but round her form A sable vapor, thickly-mantling, drew Its volumed folds, dark as the summer storm. It wrapped her round, and in an instant flew, Scattered like mist, though not a zephyr blew, And left no vestige that she there had been. The river rolled in light. The moonbeams threw Their purest radiance on the lonely scene; And hill, and grove, and rock, slept in the ray serene. Canto the Second ???????? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ??????????. ?????????. Tempestates, venteique sequuntur, Altitonans Volturnus, et Auster flumine pollens. Lucretius. I Spake the dark genius truly, when she said, That Ahrimanes rules this mundane ball? That man, in toil and darkness doomed to tread, Ambition's slave and superstition's thrall, Doth only on the power of evil call, With hymn, and prayer, and votive altar's blaze? Alas! wherever guiltless victims fall, It is possible to sacrifice victims—human victims— without cutting their throats or shedding a drop of their blood, and that too under the name and with the specious forms of justice. It is possible to display the sword of strife and be a very effective member of the church militant without the visible employment of temporal weapons. Wherever priest the sword of strife displays, Small trace remains, I ween, of ancient Oromaze. II Yet if on earth a single spot there be, Where fraud, corruption, selfishness and pride Wear not the specious robes of sanctity, With hypocritic malice to divide The bonds of love and peace by nature tied 'Twixt man and man, far as the billows roll,— Where idle tales, that truth and sense deride, Claim no dominion o'er the subject soul;— There Oromazes still exerts his mild control. III But not in fanes where priestly curses ring,— Not in the venal court,—the servile camp,— Not where the slaves of a voluptuous king Would fain o'erwhelm, in flattery's poison-damp, Truth's vestal torch and love's Promethean lamp— Not where the tools of tyrants bite the ground, Mid broken swords, and steed's ensanguined tramp, To add one gem to those that now surround Some pampered baby's brow—may trace of him be found. IV The star of day rolled on the radiant hours, And sunk again behind the western steep. The dew of twilight bathed the closing flowers. The full-orbed moon, amid the empyreal deep, Restored the reign of silence and of sleep. Again Darassah seeks the moonlight shore, But comes not now in solitude to weep: He leads the maid his inmost thoughts adore, To tempt with him the stream, and unknown scenes explore. V A bark is on the shore: the rippling wave With gentle murmur chafes against its sides. Shrinks not the maid that barrier-rock to brave, Whose jutting base the eddying river chides? Fear finds no place, where mightier love presides. They press the bark: the waters gently flow: The light sail swells: the steady vessel glides: The favoring breeze still follows as they go: They pass the barrier-rock: they haste to weal or woe. VI He holds the helm: beside him sits the maid: Her arms around her lover's form are twined: Her head upon her lover's breast is laid: Pressed to his heart, in tenderest rest reclined, Lulled by the symphony of wave and wind, To lonely isles and citron-groves she flies (By fancy's spell in fondest dreams enshrined), Where love, and health, and peaceful thoughts suffice, To renovate the bowers of earthly paradise. VII Less pure Darassah's thoughts: ambition's spell Had touched his soul, and dreams of power and fame; But feeble yet, and vague: nor knew he well, Whence those disturbed imaginations came, That touched his breast with no benignant flame. No state too proud, no destiny too high, For her he loved his wildest thought could frame. What might not that mysterious ring supply, That now had given her love, and life, and liberty? VIII But the calm elements—the placid moon— The stars, that round her rolled in still array— The plaintive breeze—the stream's responsive tune— The rapid water's silver-eddying play, That tracked in lines of light their onward way— The solemn rocks, in massy shade that frowned— The groves where light and darkness chequering lay— Breathed on his mind the peace that reigned around, And checked each turbid thought that erst had entrance found. IX The nightingale sang sweetly in the shade: The dewy rose breathed fragrance on the air. Who now more blest than that fond youth and maid, Whom the swift waters of Araxes bear, One common lot, or good or ill, to share? If ill—light falls the shaft of adverse fate, When mutual love assuages mutual care: If good—can bliss the feeling mind await, Unless one tender heart its joys participate? X So thought Kelasris, wrapped in dreams of hope; Nor deemed how soon, in time's delusive reign, The brightest tints of youthful fancy's scope Fade in the vast reality of pain, That speaks the omnipotence of Ahrimane. But while the light bark glided fast and free, And not a cloud obscured the ethereal plain, The gale—the stream—the night-bird's melody— Touched in her soul the chords of tenderer harmony. XI The stars grow pale, and o'er the western verge Of heaven the moon her parting orb suspends. She sinks behind the hill. The eddying surge Reflects the deepening blush that morning lends To eastern mountain's top, where softly blends Its misty outline with the reddening sky. Tow'rd heaven's high arch the lark exulting tends: Lost in the depth, invisible on high, He makes the rocks resound with his sweet minstrelsy. XII The sun comes forth upon the mountain-top: The wide earth feels his vivifying sway: The dewy flowers unclose, and every drop Light-trembling on the leaf—the moss—the spray— Beams like a diamond in the streams of day: All nature glitters like an orient bride, Whom countless gems and purest flowers array. The scattered mountain-mist flies fast and wide, Like incense to the shrine of morning's radiant pride. XIII The bark glides swiftly on: new scenes expand, In day's full splendor now distinctly seen. The light acacia blooms along the strand. Deep groves of pine, where laurels wave between, Rear their dark tufts of everlasting green: The sun-beams on the glossy laurel play, A trembling flood of silver radiance sheen. Now the vast oak o'ercanopies their way; And now the beetling crag, with sapless lichens gray. XIV Far on the left the lessening rocks recede: A plain extends, a wide luxuriant plain; One fair expanse of grove and flowery mead, And field, wide-waving with unripened grain; Of industry and peace the blest domain! The tinkling sheep-bell gave a pleasant sound; And youths and maids were there, a cheerful train; And rosy children gambolled on the ground, Where peeped the cottage forth from many a sylvan mound.
