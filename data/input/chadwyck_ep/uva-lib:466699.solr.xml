      <field name="fulltext">PAPISTRY STORM'D; OR, THE DINGIN' DOWN O' THE CATHEDRAL. SANG FIRST. ARGUMENT. The Muse, invokit for this wark, Screeds aff her dainty dittie; How folk begoud to gowl and bark Contrair the Roman city; And how Dan Momus stirr'd a clark Of stalwart saul and witty; And how wi' dreams a chieftain stark Was fir'd withouten pity. I sing the steir, strabush, and strife, Whan, bickerin' frae the towns o' Fife, Great bangs of bodies, thick and rife, Gaed to Sanct Androis town, And, wi' John Calvin i' their heads, And hammers i' their hands and spades, Enrag'd at idols, mass, and beads, Dang the Cathedral down: I wat the bruilzie then was dour, Wi' sticks, and stanes, and bluidy clour, Ere Papists unto Calvin's power Gaif up their strangest places; And fearfu' the stramash and stour, Whan pinnacle cam doun and tow'r, And Virgin Maries in a shower Fell flat and smash't their faces; The capper roofs, that dazzlit heaven, Were frae their rafters rent and riven; The marble altars dash't and driven; The cods wi' velvet laces, The siller ewers and candlesticks, The purple stole and gowden pyx, And tunakyls and dalmatyks, Cam tumblin' frae their cases; The Devil stood bumbaz'd to see The bonny cosy byke, whair he Had cuddlit monie a centurie, Ripp't up wi' sic disgraces! O Muse, that frae Parnassus' crown, Cam in thy multi-spanglet shoon, Lampin' alang in joyeus glee Frae jaw to jaw athort the sea, To meet the Chian king o' sang, That in his cave the lee day lang, Sat culyieing thee beside the shore Whairon th' Aegean's jappers roar; There sat he, on lone bink reclin'd, Deep musin' in his mightie mind, Some famous argument to find; Thou at his elbuck stood unseen, And wi' thy glamour glaik'd his een, Bewitchin' them to joy; Than, than, by him was brightlie seen The bitter collieshangie keen That wrocht the Greeks annoy; Ilk bluidy brulziement and battle Wi' swords, and stanes, and chariots' brattle, That never blindit nor did sattle, Till erthlins wi' a dunderin' rattle Tummlet the tow'rs o' Troy; O come down frae thy cloud on hie, Whair thou art singin' merrilie, And wi' thy wings owrshadow me, And fan my spreit to joy; And up thy magic lantern hold, That in its lookin'-glass o' gold, My glaikit ee may well behold The Papists and their faes comminglit In monie a fecht and tulzie-mulzie, Herryin' o' kirks, and image-spulzie, Whairwi' nae ear as yet hath tinglet; Thou kenn'st it a'; for thou wert there, Pitch't on the steeple's tap in air, Markin' the faces, everilk one, O' them by wham the wark was done, And notin' down within thy book Ilk motion, gesture, speik, and look, Aiblins to use on future time, And blazon them abraid in rhime: Till, underneath thy feet, I trow, Dinnelin' Deaf-Meg and Crookit Mou Names of two cannons employed on that occasion. Begoud wi' ane terrifick blatter At the great steeple's found to batter, Garrin' the stanes to dance; The steeple rock't at ilka swack; Thou saw'st the comin' crash and wrack; And flaff't thy wings, and in a crack Flew frae th' unsicker stance! Say, first, what set the folks a-fire, And made them wraithly to conspire, Contrair Cathedral, monk, and spire? The Cardinal's bluid (now rest his saul!) Lay clotter't on the castill-wall, And bauld Johne Knox, now grown the baulder, That Beaton lay in's kist the caulder, Past like a lion round the land, And wi' the wangyle in his hand, And wechtie Calvin in his wallet, Was as it were an iron mallet To break the Man o' Sin to flinders, And hurl the mass amang the cinders; He preachit east, he preachit wast; His voice was as the whirlwind's blast, That aftentimes, in days o' simmer, Comes swirlin' sudden frae the sea, And swoops the hay-cocks aff the lea, And tirls the kirks, and strips the timmer; The vera steeples round about Rebellow'd to his nobill shout, And rang wi' texts baith in and out; The dows and daws that there aboundit, As if affrichtit and confoundit, Out-whirr'd and whitter't at the sound o't; The bells and bartisans reboundit; Strang pupits flew about in blads, Breakin' the hearers' pows wi' dads; Men, women, kirtled girls, and lads, Were fir'd and furiated in squads; Sae wud and wicket was their wraith Gainst Papish trash and idol-graith, The patter'd prayers and beads, They scarce could sattle on the benches, But cock't their fists in fearfu' clenches, And slappit furiouslie their henches, And shook their angrie heads. Ae man bang't upwarts frae his place, And toss't his nieve, withouten grace, Richt i' the Virgin Mary's face. Anither wicht was mair uncivil: He brak St Ayle owr by the neevil, And bann'd baith pieces to the deevil. Some say,—maybe 'twas but a clatter,— That the town's piper, wi' a blatter, Whummlet and skail't the halie water; Be't true, be't fause, it's little matter: Had Bellarmine been sittin' cockin In Anster kirk, he'd gat a yokin' Yon day, that wou'd hae cow'd his croakin', And garr'd his head hing like a doken: The vera dead men's mooler't banes, That i' the kirk-ayle lay at rest, Amaist caught life aneath their stanes, And bowtit up amang the rest To smash the stany saints, whilk they Had worship't on a former day Whan tabernaclin' i' their clay! But hoolie, Muse! reprime your haste; Descrybe mair gently a' the matter; Ye needna rin as ye were chas'd, And blast and blaw wi' sic a blatter! Now, had the Sun's meridian chair Been heiz'd up heicher i' the air, The fiery Bull, that, e'en and morn, Keeps ever buttin' at Orion, Had toss't Apollo up in scorn Aff frae his star-betippet horn, And up the zodiack sent him flyin'; The Twins, where up they stand on heicht, Stretch'd out their arms, aye glitterand bricht, And caught him mid a show'r o' beams, That halflins blindet wi' their sheen, As down they fell intil his een, The gentle Castor wi' their gleams: And merry May, fram whare she lay In Abyssinia's gardens sleepin', Wak'd by the Hours frae bonnie bowers, Up Titan's peth comes lampin', leapin'; And ever as she gaes a-trippin', Her fingers in her basket dippin', Pick witch-bells out, dear daffodillies, Kingcups and spinks, and livelie lilies, And sparple them in frisky mirth Ow'r the great waist o' mither Yerth. Auld mither Yerth, now sick o' frost, Unwrinkles a' her cauldrife face, And shines abraid thro' ilka coast, And breirds and beautifies apace: 'Mid sic joyeusitie, I wot, Th' east neuk o' Fife was nae forgot: The aits and barley there were springin', The lavricks i' the lift were singin', The leas wi' ploughmen's lilts were ringin'; Auld grandshers at their doors sat beikin, While younksters, by the sea-side streikin', Gaed paidlin' in without a breik on; E'en senseless kye did rowt wi' glee; The sillie fishes i' the sea Lap frae their element in play To kiss the gowden gleam o' day. Nae marvel then, that, to his mither, Cried Piper-Jock, “May I be licket, Gin there has been sic guid spring-weather Syn' Cardinal Beaton's craig was sticket!” Sic was the season, siccan wedder, Whan Maister Knox and Maister Rough, Twa cronies link't in love thegidder, Merrilie march'd frae Edinbrogh, To hunt the Roman beast in Fife, And ettle fiercely at his life Wi' Calvin's lang sharp-nebbit knife. The tane atween Kinghorn and Crail Eastlins frae town to town gaed preachin'; The tither, nae less brym in zeal, In landwart parochins gaed stretchin'; Kirkcaldy Papists, iron-heartit, Now wi' their stany idols partit; The Gallowtown was clean convertit; The Dysart heughmen left their places O' darkness now, and wash't their faces, Ardent for homilies and graces. The Upper Largo and the Nether Deem'd Papistry now but a blether; Weems cried out, “Hang it in a tether.” The sinfu' bodies o' the Elie Were spain'd frae image-worship hailly; St Monan's fishermen, brain-wud, Flang their auld dead stock-saint o' wood Aff their puir pier intil the flood; Mad Pittenweem waged deadly weir Wi' their fat capon-lined prior; (Need little wonder be o' that; They were sae lean, and he sae fat!) Wast Anster town was clean uprisen; East Anster burghers, monie a dozen, Were fraithin' at the mou', and fizzin' At beads and halie water; Cauld Cellardyke had ta'en the gee; Her boats, deil ane was now at sea, Haddocks and skate were let abee For mair important matter; Crail town was up wi' gashin' gabs; Wabsters, throu' zeal, forgat their wabs; Tailors' fierce mou's gaif bitter stabs; And brewsters' tongues, wi' dads and dabs, Rome's skelpie-limmer thumpet; Clerk Diston ca'd the Paip an ass; And the strang craig o' Baillie Glass, Through ilka street as he did pass, Against our Ladie and the mass Gaed rairin' like a trumpet. While thus in town and royal brogh The burghers' tongues were set a-birrin', Nae less, inflam't by Maister Rough, The lairds in landwart pairts were stirrin': Kilbrachmont Ramsay raise in anger, The laird o' Grange could thole nae langer; Stout Fisher-Willie swore, gin he Drew but anither drave o' fish up, He'd sooner fling them back i' the sea Than gi'e ae teind-skate to the bishop: Balcaskie's tongue rapp't out a rippet 'Gainst shaven-crowns sae trigly clippit, And Cordelier, round cap, and tippet: Ane beggin' freir he frae his wicket Wi' terrible fierce birr he kicket; He gave his lunzie sic a lounder As did the sillie man dumfounder, And dang him flatlins like ane flounder. Sour Sipsie showl'd a saucy mou' Whan onie idol met his view; He bann'd thir Virgins made o' stane; He'd never kneel again to ane. But Barns, a laird o' gentler breedin', Held at his Latin Bible readin', Pickin' out pithfu' texts and strang, Wharewi' Crail's gaukit priest he dang, Garrin' him ride John Calvin's stang. Carnbee, though sober, grave, and douce, Turnin' tongue-ferdy now and crouse, Gaed stormin' round frae house to house, Blasphemin' with a glorious din The king-corruptin' bawd o' sin; Pitcorthie, though his wife yet wavers, His faith confessit manfullie: “Sorrow gin Paip was boil'd to taivers, And I'd a platefu' o' the bree!” While thus the furious folk o' Fife At Paip and idol in their strife, Were murgeonin' and mockin', Lo! on Olympus' taps preclair The goddess o' men-blessin' lear, Owr-archit by a rainbow bricht, That, ow'r her dribblet blobs o' licht, Sat workin' at her stockin'; For she had task't hersel, perfay, To work before a certain day A pair o' stockins to her daddy, And there, upon the mountain's tap, Her clew o' worsit in her lap, Sat Wisdom's winsome lady: The wyres were gowden, braw to see, Wharewi' her fingers prettilie Did niddle i' their play; As hitch on hitch succeedin' fast, Aff frae the gowden points were cast, And, sattlin' on the dazzlin' hose, Heigher and heigher still arose, In texture rich and gay: Sae was she busy, whan, by chance, Stravaigin throu' the sky, her glance Saw far ayont the hills o' France The folk o' Fife in stirr; Her lairds on kirk-reform intent, Her burghers on the bruilzie bent, Clerk Diston wud at painted saint, And Barns, at's Latin Testament, Fast readin' wi' a birr: She saw, and joyeus at the view, Down on the yird she drave and threw Stockin', and wire, and worsit-clew, And to her feet upsprang; “What! maun I see yon bairns o' mine,” She cry'd, “sae bown on deeds divine, And I na help their weak ingyne Wi' my suggestions strang? Mine be the wark!” And, as she said, She weeglit her wing-wavin' shoon, And frae Olympus' gowany head Aff-flew like fairy frae the moon. There is within the warld somewhair (I ken it, though I downa tell) A hollow, happie place, where Care, That hunts poor mortals late and air, Hath never yet been kent to dwell. For why? Fun at the door-stane stands, And slaps him back wi' baith his hands. That temple's flures and wa's are lined Wi' leifsum pictures a' kinkind; Ilk comic scene of ilka age, Glean'd out of ilka sayar's page, Frae him wha sang how mouse and frog Waged bluidy bruilzie i' their bog, Garrin' its rashies shake and shog, Down to that later baird wha tauld, How, for ane useless bucket auld, The Lombard hosts ilk ither maul'd: Tassoni. A' thae, ensculptur'd bricht and braw, Garnish't ilk bonnie marble wa'; Great gaulfs o' lauchter aye resound In ilka corner round and round, Like roarie-buckies, i' their din, Loud soundin' as the sea comes in: Syk is the nature o' that grot To echoe sae, e'en should there not Be gaupin body on the spot; Around the altar prance and pace Globe-cheekit Fun, whase fatty face Bonnily blumes wi' glad grimace, And Comus, his renownit brither, (Twin-bairns o' Revelry their mither,) Ticklin' to frenzy ane anither; As priests and as attendants, they Wait on and serve baith nicht and day, Enravishin' Dan Momus' nose Wi' fumes frae comedie and play, Ballad, and mime, and roundelay, The marrow o' sweet verse and prose, Wharewi' that altar aye is fed, Makin' wi' smeik his naistrills gled:— Aloft the godkin sits in pride, Exultin' in the jokes o' men, And thro' his mask, that jimp can hide The glee that on his cheeks doth ride, Blinks waggish glances now and then, And flytes upon his priests sae jolly For heaviness and melancholy; The friskier for the flytin', they Gaffaw and smirkle in their play. 'Mid sic like daffery and glaikin', Baith god and priest were merry-makin', Whan, hark! upon the gowden door, Tirl! comes a rap, as seld' before; Sir Fun uplifts the sneck, And, lo! the goddess in her glore Gaes in and mak's her beck; Dan Momus look't bombas'd a wee Her learnit ladyship to see; Quo' she,—“All hail, sweet son o' Nox! Father o' daffin, jaips, and jokes!— O, be na put in fricht, That thus I bang upon thine een Sae sudden, wi' confoundin' sheen, Down fram Olympus heicht; I hae a sma' demand to make, Whilk, for mine and my deddy's sake, I houp thou'lt think na scorn to take Some fashery to do richt.” Quo' he,—“Speik out your will mair clear; Mass! I am glad to see you here; You've been a stranger monie a year; Ye're welcome to my sicht.” Quo' she,—“I maunna tarry lang; Fife's merry bodies now are thrang Berappin' wi' their tongues, ding-dang, Sir Paip and a' his rotten gang; Their cause is your's and mine, And it is Learning's; thairfore come And let us at the bawd o' Rome. Her bordel-house maun down be plucket, Her huge Augean stable muckit, Ere Lear shoot up and shine: Gang you then to auld Caryl town, (An auncient brogh o' some renown, Near to the neis o' Fife,) There catch and cleik her cunnin' clark, And in his bosom clap a spark, Enflamin' him for this guid wark O' kirk-rapyne and strife; While I sall aff to Anster town, And raise a chieftain o' renown, Makin' him fiery-wud and bown To seek the harlot's life. Gude Fisher-Willie is his name, For lollardrie o' meikle fame, Wha sits within his house o' Dreil Blasphemin' with a valiant zeal Twa ne'er-do-weels, the Paip and deil, Wi' gleeks at Guise and Mary; He and the clerk, twin-heroes baith, At our suggest, shall no be laith (Bein' wally wichts and wary) To raise the mob, for 'sault and scaith, And sailzie kirk wi' weir and wraith, And make a fierie-farie.” This said, Dan Momus wasna slaw, By lauchter, his assent to shaw; He nicker't sic a lang gaffaw The cavern rang frae wa' to wa': Anon, he, in a blink, Tucks up his pyrnit tunic bra, And, whirrin' throu' the key-hole sma', Down, down the heav'n's star-studdit ha' Gaes whizzin' like a fiery ba', Mair quick than man can think: He lichts, preceese at aucht o'clock, On Crail's auld steeple's weathercock; Tip-taes upon its capper crown He stands, and casts his een about Round the hale houses o' the town, To spy the noble not'ry out. Now sae it chanc'd, that, on that nicht, Girt wi' a groupe o' gossips bricht, Clerk Diston, thron'd and seatit richt, In Luckie Kay's was sittin': A burde afore him, braid and lang, Whare stoups and jinglin' glasses thrang, Wi' helter-skelter cling-and-clang, Gaed flykerin' and flittin'; The flotter't table maist was steepit Wi' claret-dubs that drapt and dreepit, As the mad bottles never sleepit, But firstlins ae cork, than the tither, Hetly they chasit ane anither, In bousy Bacchanalian flither, As fast as they could bicker; Heigh at ae end in elbuck-chair He sat, and royalees'd it there Wi' jokes and ready wit, and lear, That flash't out quick and quicker; His bottle-cronies' faces a' Gilt rubicond, and bernish't bra, Glister't on ilk side like a raw O' hairst-moons down the table; And aye as jaip and jest he brak On Papistrie and her vile pack, As thunder on the fire-slacht's back, Tempestuouslie there cam' a crack O' gaulps incomparable, Sae that the chalmer, in and round it, Wi' thuds o' merriment resoundit; And Luckie Kay, at the rebound o't, Sat in her chimla-nook astoundit! Dan Momus, frae the steeple's heicht, Pryin' and prievin' wi' his sicht, Saw, throu' the stany wa', ('Twas wi' his een like crystal clear,) The clerk upon his tavern-cheir, Thron'd gloriouslie amid his feir O' fellow-bousers braw; He saw, and gave his wings a flaff, And frae the cock's kaim flotit aff: Scrimply there pass't a stound o' time, Ere, throu' the thick stane and the lime, He slippit like a beam throu' glass; (For heathen gods, like ghaists, can pass Throu' wa's o' stane, or yetts o' brass:) There was a sough, like flann or flaw, As in he whihher'd throu' the wa', But nane his gawcy godship saw; For why? He will'd it should be swa: Fornent the clerk, the burde aboon, Himsel' he pitch't and poisit soon, And flichter't baith his wings, whareby Their tipsy cheeks, they kent na why, Were fanned wi' the flaff; Than to the not'ry's een alane, Mair bricht than pearl or ruby stane, His frame shone out in licht serene, Garrin the chalmer lauff; The jolly gossips saw the licht On roof and flure refleckit bricht, But nane, except the favour't wicht, Kent whence it bleized on their sicht; And he alane it was whase ear The godkin's guid discourse did hear; 'Twas ettled for nane ither; (The rest, as he his parle out-spoutit, Sat gazin' goutherfow, and doutit, Glowrin' at ane anither;) “O thou that thus in Bacchus' chaire Sits governin' in glorie there, Direckin' wi' thy voices rair The storm o' tavern-glee, Waesucks, man! this is na the time For sangs, and jaips, and raivin' rhime, And rants and rhapsodies sublime That ding the saul a-jee; A doucer and a better wark Befits thee now, renownit clark; Whan folks are strippin' to the sark, And lab'rin' a' their micht To batter down a sinfu' kirk, Up, up, and gie the Pape a jerk, And in his droddum clap the dirk O' reformation richt: Arise, and ring the gatherin'-bell, And head the multitude yoursell; Wi' hammer, halbert, maul, and mell, March to Sanct Androis town, And batter down baith stane and timmer, O' th' brothel whare the scarlet limmer Has toss'd her head for monie a simmer, And worn th' unwerdy crown; Lay bare her pridefu' biggings braw; Root, root her out o' house and ha; Turn her adrift to rain or snaw, Stript naket to the skin, That the vile vermin that ha'e crawl'd Sae lang about her garments fauld May perish in the winter's cauld, And clean the warld o' dirt and sin: Rise, then; and heave aside the cup; And grip the knappin'-hammer up; March, muster, cry, Hurro! Down wi' the mass and monkish squad, Down wi' the jad in scarlet clad; Up, up, and lay her low!” This said, Dan Momus frae his face His mask upliftit for a space, That the bauld-bosom'd clerk mith get A waff o' his face ere aff he set: His face wi' lauchter's mirth-mad licht Burn'd sae insufferablie bricht, That, butten jeopardie, nae wicht Could stand that lauchter-lowin' sicht; Whairfore, to save the man frae scaith, Lest lookin' lang he'd die the death, Dan Momus, frae the place, Evanish't like a dead man's wraith, Or candle blawn out by the breath, Or bellerin' bubble made o' fraith, That does na leave a trace; A canny waff o' sweet perfume Was blawn in breezes throu' the room: I wot, th' astonay'd not'ry then Felt wodeness bernin' in his brain; Upwards he boltit frae his chaire, As if his hand begrasp't already An iron-geddok, swerd, or spear, To damnifie the scarlet lady; The table stotter't on the floor Wi' straiks that frae his neif descendit; Stoups, bottles, glasses, tumblin' o'er, Were smash't and wi' their claret blendet; Ho, hearts! up, ane and a'! and at her! Have at a fousome kirk, and batter Her lustfu' banes untill they clatter! Smite! Ettle at the life! On, on, and cry na, Barlafummill, Till down amang the dirt she tummle, And bury beggin'-freir and bummel; That wi' the ruin and the rummle The Deil be frichtet out o' Fife! While Momus thus in Luckie Kay's, Blew Diston's saul up in a blaise, Lo! on a nicht-cloud in mid-air, The goddess o' men-blessin' lear Against Sir Knicht was plottin' sair: And monie a slee and paukie scheme Her head did generate and freme; At last she chose the stratageme O' wauk'nin' Willie wi' a dreme. Aff to the house o' dremes she gangs, Whair round the wa's they stick in bangs, Like lempets stickin' upon rocks; Or flee about on skinklin' wing, Like butterflies in days o' spring, Around the flow'rs or cabbage-stocks; She wale'd out ane, a pretty fairy, Beltit wi' ribbons glairy-flairy, And monie a tassel and fleegarie, Whase colours aye did shift and vary; Her body, as it mov'd, did ever Like to an opal gleam and quiver; (Sister to that sweet dreme that went To Agamemnon in his tent:) She tauld the friskie fairy thing Whairtill to flee on rapid wing; The thing at her command gaed scrievin' Wi' sic a breesil down the heivin, It beat the thunder-boltit leven: You scarce could say, your een could see Its motion spinnerin' fram on hie; Ae moment its celestial stance Was up near whair the Pleiads dance; The tother, it had downwarts fled, And hover't its slim airy head Our Fisher-Willie's carvit bed; By this time, Anster's steeple-bell Had wi' her hammer chappit twell; And the knicht-fisher, ere the chap, Engarlandet wi' bien nicht-cap, In bed lay sleepin' like a tap; Sith he was aye ane sober wicht, And gaed to bed guid time o' nicht, As douce folks do that walk upricht: Heigh owr the bolster, near his head, The feeble vision took its stede; And throu' his naistrills-valves began To werk upon the slummerin' man: Ere this his brain was clear o' dreams; But now wi' gowden lichts it gleams, As streamers aft throu' clearest sky In merry-dance flash out and fly. He dream'd that he gat wings whairwi' He flew, as wi' an angel's glee, Owr Fife frae Stirling to the sea; And aye he look't down in his flicht To spy her bonnie lairdships bricht Glitterand wi' gowans and wi' licht; As in a sunny simmer day, Th' horizon's air aft seems to play, And flicht in waves and flash away; Sae bleme'd, unto that dreamer's sicht, Fife's grassy hills and valleys bricht Wi' gowden undulatin' licht: Ilk laird's domain was clearly seen Defin'd wi' streaps o' silver sheen, That intervein'd the manors green; A' things were goodlie, glorious, grand, Exceptin' that in ilk laird's land A great tar-barrel seem'd to stand; And in that uglie tun stood, lair'd Up to the chin and clotter't beard, Greetin' and gumple-faced, a laird; Sir Knicht did hing a while on wing, Marvellin' the meanin' o' that thing; Whan, lo! out frae his castill came, Wi' his braid hat as red as flame, And a' his cardinal's attire, He that in his ungodlie ire, Damn'd godlie Wishart to the fire; A great wax-taper, redly lowin', That frae the altar he had stowin', He carry't in his murd'rous hand, And us'd it as a kendlin' brand, As he gaed martyrin' thro' the land: To ilk tar-tun he pat the lowe; At ance it flew up in a glowe; East, wast, he in a mament flees; That mament's space did weel suffees To set the haill land in a bleis: Three hundred pillars lang and high O' smeik gaed curlin' to the sky: Ah! than he saw the wretchit men Wreein' and wreethin' wi' the pain, As the flame ate them to the bane: And siccan hidyous yells and shrieks!— A' the warld soundit wi' their skrieks:— Tears rappit down the dreamer's cheeks! Than on himsel his thochts recule; He, too, might ha'e his share o' dool; He glancit down on bonnie Dreel; He saw his ain barr'l burnin' weil, And bleisin' a tremendous bele. He saw himsel amid the blaze, As round and round his head it plays!— He waken't at the frichtsom gaze;— His limbs were quakin' 'neath the claes;— Albeit he was sterk carl and strang, The cauld sweat frae his marrow sprang: Ten times he turn't frae side to back, Ere he anither souff could tak; Its stance meanwhile the Dream did keep Ready, whan anes he fell asleep, Down on his harns again to leap:— He slept;—he dreamit ance again; He dreamit, that, on ocean's plain, He in his paintit pleasure-boat, At mid-day, whan the sun was hot, Did sail for pastime and for play, Far, far ayont the isle o' May; The lift was clear throughout and bricht Wi' rivers o' sun-shiney licht; The sea in clearness seem't to vie Wi' the round looking-glass o' sky: He saw the rocks and tangly meads Whair the big meer-swine mak their beds, A thousand faddom deep and mair, As clear as gin he walkit there; Great skulls o' haddock, cod, and ling, Like siller arrows frae the wing, Gaed skuddin' thro' the mighty deep; He heard them whizzin' in his sleep: His nets he cast; and, lo! wi' fish His nets were gluttit to his wish; He drew them up wi' toyle and fecht; His yawl near swampit wi' the wecht: But sic a draft o' fishes sheen He never saw yet wi' his een; Siller lay shimmerin' on their skins; Gowd was affrontit by their fins; As glowr'd he on his fishy heaps, Lo! lo! cam sailin' owr the deeps (Three frae the east, three down the Forth, Twa frae the south, twa frae the north,) Ten bonnie boaties, skimmin' licht, Garnisht wi' gowden foolyie bricht; And in ilk boatie's fore-stem cockit A lang bra' bishop in his rocket; A mitre prank'd his pow; his hand Dangl'd about a crosier wand: Sic gallant bishops wi' sic mitres Rome ne'er admyr'd in her Sanct Peter's; But Fisher-Willie, whan he saw Thir burlie bishops big and bra', Thrang swallowin' wi' their greedy een His drave o' haddocks clear and clean, He waxed wod wi' vera teen: But mair pertrubill'd was his case, Whan chasin' fast the tane the tither They cam a' round him in a fluther, And sieg'd his boat frae stem to ruther, Yelpin' and youtin' in his face: My teinds! gi'e me my teinds, Sir Knicht! I canna want my teinds till nicht! And in a gliffin' ilka bishop Ramm'd in his hand and cleik'd his fish up; And aye they glampt, and aye they glaum'd, And aye the tither teind they palm'd, Till feint a haddock, ling, or potley, Remain'd o' a' that i' the boat lay; Whairat the mauchty Knicht took fire; His bluid birr'd thro' his buik wi' ire; As whan a pat wi' beef and bane Is hung owr fire by Kate or Jane, The ragin' lowes gae up its sides, Garrin' plish-plash the internal tides, As to the swey-crook Vulcan rides Curlin' in smeeky majestie; The broo boils up wi' sotterin' sound; Whummils the beef its dainty pound; Sebows and leeks dance up and bound; And barley-pickles flee round and round Hilliegileerie 'mang the bree: E'en sae did that fierce fisher's bluid Mount up and bubble wild and wud, As he beheld ilk bishop's claw Glaum at his fish and cleik them a'; Than frae his bed he spang'd and shot; (Perdê! he thoucht he was in's boat Sailin' for pastime and for play Sax miles ayont the isle o' May); The bed-clais to the roof he dang; Sheer to his feet he upwarts sprang To whair his guidly sword did hang Aboon his head for need; He haul'd it wraithly frae its pin; He gript, he swang it round wi' din; He smasht and smote thae men o' sin For their gear-graspin' greed; He drave it on the puir cod-wares; He gulligaw'd the posts wi' scars; The coverlets dree'd ne'er sic wars; The fecht was loud and lang; He slasht awa for near ane hour; The sweat frae lith and limb did pour; The Knicht ne'er blindit nor gave owr, Until wi' gastly gash and clour Thir bishops dead he dang; The like before was never kent, That sakeless sheets should sae be shent, And cods should dree what wraith was meant For mensless men whase sauls were bent On covetize and wrang! As illustrative of the latter dream, it may be mentioned, that Mr D. Straton, a Fife laird, was burnt by the Bishop of St Andrews for refusing him the teinds of the fish caught in his pleasure-boat.—See Knox. END OF FIRST SANG. SANG SECOND. ARGUMENT. Here sall I say how Crail's-men broke Out frae their beds wi' beir; And how nae less the Anster folk Were pit in meikle steir; And how they owr the muirs did flock, Array'd in graith o' weir; And George Buchanan, canty cock, How he drew to them near. Dan Phœbus in his eastland bow'r Startit frae sleep 'tween three and four, And busk't him in his dandiest duds, For his lang journey thro' the cluds; His velvet breeks, as red as fire, The snoddest pairt o' his attire, Whilk a' the nations do admire, He drew up on his galliard thies: His spanglet glairy-flairy vest, The Ethiops' wonder east and west, He button'd bonny round his waist, Settin' his belly in a bleis; His coat, wi' gowden sleeves bedicht, Whase fiery neck gleams out sae bricht, The sterns are blindet wi' the licht, Apparyll'd his braid showthers weil; His cockit-hat wi' canny care. He clapt upon his roseat hair; His jewell'd shoon (a bonny pair!) He strappit fast round ilka heel; Syn to the Hours he cry'd, My staff, My staff, ye jads, and let me aff! 'Tis time o' day by Anster clock That I was over India's rock! And, swith! they bring his staff, And throu' Aurora's gildet gate, Whistlin', he took his gladsome gait, And up the pend at furious rate Gaed spielin', spankin', aff! The lavrick yet was scarcely singin' When Crail's auld bell was set a ringin'; For what throu' Momus, what throu' zeal, Clerk Diston sleepit nae great deal; The gallant spirit in his breast Was set against the Roman beast, Wi' sticks and stanes to clash and clout him, And batter down his den about him; Forthwith to congregate the people, He socht the bell-tow i' the steeple; He gript it like a man distrackit; The bell-wheel, as it gaed round, cracket, And rattlet a tremendous racket: Out flew, fram ilka hole and cleft, The swallows and the dows like drift; Frae its foundation to its spinnel The steeple's length did dirl and dinnel; Nae marvel then, that at the din Scarr'd bodies frae their hames did rin; Ae man ran out without the breiks, Though he had kept his bed for weeks; Ane bangit out in sic a flither, He took ae shae, he left the tither; On stockin' soles ran out anither; Peter's richt leg was in a breik, The tither leg was bare and bleak; Out to the causeys birr'd the women; Their weanies lay in cradles screamin'; Doors reessil'd up, and made a blatter; Causeys did claik wi' clitter-clatter; Ane cry't out, What a-deil's the matter; Ane answer't, Kirkmay is a-fire! Anither, Satan's in the spire! Ane cry'd, The Pape, the Pape is near! He's landit at Sanct Androis' pier, Wi' hosts o' friers, a monstrous pack, And tenscore Cardinals at his back! They're arm't wi' swerds baith tane and tither; Deil tak it, we're a' dead thegither! They ran a' throuther in their hurry, Reel-rall, hallooin', hurry-scurry; Bairns screegh'd; dogs yamff'd and youll'd outricht; The swine ran thro' the streets wi' fricht, And drown't themselves intill the sea; That fricht nae langer could they dree:— Sic dridder drear, sic panic pale Took ilka livin' thing in Crail! Meantime while thus, aside the clerk, Affairs gaed on wi' siccan dirdom, Guid Fisher-William for the werk Set up his spirit nae less sterk; Sae fiercelins had his wid-dreme stirr'd him: Nae sooner clapt he on his claes, Than, boun for bus'ness, aff he gaes; He soucht his henchman that did stand Wi' ane pow-axe intill his hand, Aye watchin' at his yett, Ready, when robbers did appear, To bring his wappen down wi' beir, And cleeve their heads fram ear to ear, Wi' terrible down-sett; That henchman's name, as I've heard say, Was galland Andrew Halliday; Warder! quo he, gang straucht and tell Dan Oliphant to ring his bell; Alswa, bid Barclay grip his tow, And gi'e the great kirk-bell a jow: Out-ring frae kitchen and frae ha' My burghers dear, and get them a' Convenit at the cross; The weird-set day begins to daw, (Its sign upon the heiven I knaw), Whan we maun at a noble ca' Bring Papistrie to loss: Thus said, Dan Andrew, at his biddin', Unslot his yett, and out gaed whiddin', His bastoun in his hand to rap The slumb'rous Barclay frae his nap: Meanwhile the mauchty fisher-knicht Upspiel'd his staircase fleet and licht, E'en to the gerret's leaden heicht, Wi' swesch-trump in his hand; Aye as he mountit ilka stair, Some fairy sough'd intill his ear; Blaw loud, Sir Knicht, and dinna fear, To sturtle up the land: Heigh on the bartisan he stood; He saw the day keek owr the flood; He kent upon the eastern cloud Weird's lucky sign hung out; He pat the trumpet till his mou; Sae lang, sae terrible, he blew, The dinnel'd sky dreep't draps o' dew, And tremblet at the tout; 'Twas heard at back o' Largo-law; At Cupar cross they kent the blaw; The lift, the lift is fa'n, but dout, A man in Falkland streets cry'd out; The prior o' Sanct Androis town, Whair he on bed was sleepin' soun', Bumbazit at the blastin' soun', Up frae his blankets jumpet; The monks and canons on their beds Did bang up frae the cods their heads, And tauld in mazerment their beads; They thocht it the last trumpet; Nae marvel, then, that men and wives, In Anster, and the towns about it, Were frichtit for their vera lives Whan Fisher-Willie's trumpet toutit; And, mair to magnifie their wonder, At anes the bells baith up and under Begoud to rattle on like thunder: For in his bell-house, David Barclay Ne'er flourished his tow mair starkly; Lang Geordie, syn his buik was langer, Tugg'd at his dancin' tow the stranger: Ilk clapper gaif ilk bell sic paiks, They swat on baith sides wi' the straiks; Sae what wi' swesch-trump, what wi' bells, The Anster folks were jimp themsells; Bailie and burgher, man and woman, Flew frae their doors like bullets bummin'; Auld Saunders Clerk, a man o' echty, Though eild-encumber't now and wechty, His breeks has like a lion tane, And birrs them on wi' micht and main: Jean Grieve, as frae her bed she loupit, Puir body! owr the bed-stock coupit, And, lichtin' on the cauld flure-stane, Maist dislocate her henchle-bane; Exceptin' her (for she lay sprauchin'), And Robie Brown and David Strachan, (For they were bedrals baith), The fient a body that had feet, That didna skirr into the street, Effrayt, and out o' breath; And some flew hither, some flew thither, They overthrew the tane the tither; Sic feerie-farie and sic flither Were never in a' Fife thegither: As when at Rome, upon the day When Casca did brave Julius slay, The Roman people in a fray Ran to the forum flockin; The Capitol amaist was shiftet Wi' crowds that hither-thither driftet; Great skrieghs were to the skies upliftet; Ilk house wi' fricht was rockin': Sae to the cross o' Anster ran Hirdie-girdie, woman and man: Whan they were a' forgadder'd there, A man stood up upon a stair: (Nane kent him wha he was or whence; Nane saw him e'er before or since; Some Papists said it was the Deil: Na, na; it was some better chiel; I ken his grunkle unca weil:) He cry'd,—“O, friends! I'm glad to see ye; Sae mickle zeal and smeddum wi' ye: Ay, ay, your heads hae routh o' zeal 'Gainst Pape, and Papistry, and Deil; Nae doubt o' that, I see it weel, Het on your noses burnin'; But, will-a-wins! your hands are toom O' chappin-stick and weirlike loom, To batter at the bawd o' Rome, And mak' her monks gae mournin'; Arm, arm your hands wi' shools and sticks, And sweys, and cuddy-rungs, and picks; March to the martyr-murderin' town, And pu' the pridefu' biggings down; Rive but the auld nests aff the tree, The fient ae howdie-craw you'll see:— But my advice is, short and lang, Tak' your disjeunes afore you gang!” This spoke, the man did disappear; Some said he flew up in the air; Some said he doukit down at anes Betwixt the weil-pav'd causey-stanes, As ghaists through threuch-stanes in a blink Hame to their graves are seen to sink; And some said ae thing, some anither; But it was a' a perfect blether: Ye needna mind their clash a feather. When he was gane, they didna fail To tak' his counsel, and to skail: Aff, sae they skeygit, man and dame, As gin cauld Hunger by the wame Had grippit them, and nipt them hame, Wi' vengeance, hurry-scurry:— Their ambries then they did assail; Some ran to parritch, some to kail; Some ran to claret, some to ale, And some to tartan-purry; Some knapp't awa' at kebbuck-stumps; Some riv'd and ramsh'd at beefy rumps; Some nibblet bits, some gobblet lumps; Chaft-blades and chafts, and teeth and stumps, Now rattlet in a hurry: Bannocks of a' kinkind o' meal, Great baps and scones were swallow d hail; Mountains o' bread and seas o' ale Were down their pechans pour'd; Frae Cellardyke to Perth or Crieff, There never was, in my belief, In capons, parritch, wine, and beef, Sic a disjeune devour'd! Whan they had endit their disjeune, They raik'd about for wappens soon; Some ran to aiken-rungs and sticks; Some ran to pinches and to picks; Some grippet, for the greater skaith, Great iron stanchels in their wraith; Some haurl'd at cart and barrow trams, For laik o' better batterin'-rams; Some flourish'd sweys and masons' tools, And graips, and forks, and guid shod-shools; Taylors stole swerds, and sae did souters; Plewmen cam heavy-arm't wi' couters; Wabsters their looms in pieces brak, And up the beams for wappens tak; The bluidy butchers, and the baxters, Had chappin'-knives beneath their oxters; The barbers, fraithy as their suds, Instead o' razors, flourish'd cuds; Blacksmiths cam' arm't wi' tangs and nippers; Wi' handspakes, fishermen and skippers; Bailies rush'd out frae council-chalmers Wi' halberts and wi' knappin'-hammers; A' wi' the same fers wraith were gapin', But ilk ane had a different weapon: This man bare wood, and that bare iron, But ilka saul wi' zeal was birrin'. As they were armin' a' this time, Town's-piper Jock, wi' glee sublime, Gaed skrieghin' throu' the streets and skirlin', Settin' the windocks a' a-dirlin'; Wi' spraichs o' bairns, a royat pack, Loupin' and shoutin' at his back; His pipes wi' sic a squeal did squeak, In the seven sterns they heard the skriek; His drone did gruntch sae dour a sound, Black Pluto heard it underground: Sae what wi' gruntlin', what wi' squealin', The causey-stanes were maist set reelin'; Aye at ilk corner evermair He stopt, and gaif a hearty rair; “Gae to the loan, and muster there!” As whan, at michty Hector's ca', The folks within the Trojan wa', Clad in their coats o' armour bra', Ran frae the Scaean yett; 'Tween the wild fig-tree and the watter The weiriors gather'd wi' a clatter; Chariots and horse-hoofs round did scatter Scamander's sand wi spairge and splatter, Till in mid plain they mett; Sae, at the skriegh o' Piper Jock, The burghers to the loan did flock; Aye as they spank'd alang and sprung, Their arms, stick, pick, and cuddy-rung, On ane anither clank't and rung; As whan in tail o' hairst, some day, Whan skiffs o' wind blaw aff the brae, A field o' beans (lang dainty strae!) Are touslet by the blast; The bean-taps slap on ane anither, Ilk meikle stalk assails his brither, The reisslin' cods wag hither-thither, The shearers look aghast; Sic like the breissil and the clatter, As to the loan the brughers blatter. Ere they were a' assemblet out, The sun rode o'er the isle o' May; 'Twas acht o'clock, or thairabout, By the school-dial near the way; At that time in the east was seen, Owr Innergellie's greenwood green, A cloud o' stour, that owr the trees Cam' swirlin' wi' the eastern breeze: And westlins aye it swirl'd and blew, And nearer aye and nearer drew, As if a whirlwind, derf and dour, Had ridden post frae Denmark owr, And now was busy wi' the stour. As on it swiff'd and swirl'd mair near, A scharp-ee'd man, whase sicht was clear, Beneath the stowry tourbillon, Micht see slow movin' westlins on, Shouthers and pows, an unco crowd, A hundert-headed multitude, And owr their heads lang rungs and cuds Wavin' atween them and the cluds; And swerds and halberts, braid and clear, Glitterand baith i' the front and rear; And the town's colours, heiz'd on hie, Flaffin' and flamin' gallandlie; And the town's drum, as if for battle, Reirdin' awa' wi' furious rattle: “The men o' Crail!” a man did shout; “The men o' Crail!” cried hundreds out; “Clerk Diston in the van!” “Harro!” the folk o' Caryl cry'd; “Hurra!” the Anster folk reply'd; “Harro!” cry'd wife and man: “Death to the Paip!” scream'd Caryl's crowd; “Down wi' the Paip!” skriech'd Anster loud; “Together 'gainst the Beast!” together They vy'd in shouts wi' ane anither, As to embrace ilk man his brither Fordwarts they rush't and ran: Bra thing it was, perfay, to view Sae blithe and brisk a hallybaloo, As intill ither's arms they flew, And caps and cowls, and bannets blue, To spiel the lift began. While they were thus in frisky flither, Salutin' ilka man the tither, And speirin' things at ane anither, Lo! frae the country-seats around, The lairds, wi' flunkie and wi' hound, Come daidlin', drappin' in; For they had heard the trumpet-sound, That had the kintra round and round Bedunder't wi' its din; And up they bangit frae their beds, And out at windocks shot their heads, Effrayt what this might mean: They'd heard the bell's far-soundin' jow; They kent there was some hobbleshow; Horses in haste were order't now, And whips and spurs bedien: So down they come; and you may hear Their bridles jinglin' loud and clear, And flunkies' whistle, as mair near Down frae their lands they ride: And you may see a mile awa' Their gowden-laced waistcoats bra' Whairon the sun-blenks, as they fa', Appeir to rest wi' pride: I see Grangemuir;—he comes in glee; His face, contorted funnilie, Haulds in its faulds a prophecie O' meikle mirth and ploy; I see Balcaskie;—as he rides Spleen-burstin' lauchter shakes his sides; The very naig that he bestrides Seems neicherin' too for joy: See Sipsie! how he skewls his mou', And glooms and gluntches at the crew O' chisel'd saints and gods untrue, Whilk he in fancy views! And look! how douce lang-headet Barns, Wi' lades o' learnin' in his harns, Comes trottin' cannily alang, At's Latin Bible searchin' thrang For texts that he may use! But the bauld laird of Innergellie, Himsel' in green, baith back and bellie, (His varlet flamin' out in yellow,) Comes bannin' unabash't; See how his cheeks do storm and lour Wi' angry puffs against the stour, That his ain horse-cluifs, as they scour, Up in his face hae dash'd; Mair soberlie trots Airdrie on, And Renniehill, and Gibliston, And lesser lairdies, four or five, Wham here to name, or to descrive, I canna now be fash'd. A' thae did mix, and meet and gather Upo' the musterin'-ground thegither; The fisher-knicht enarm'd them weil Wi' swerds and pow-axes frae Dreel: As they up-gript ilk man his wappen, Aboon their heads a thing did happen, Whilk, tho' the mob were ramp already, Render'd their hearts mair keen and crouse T' attack within her bordel-house, Rome's king-debauchin' lady: For, lo! fram Innergellie's trees, Careerin' on the pirrin' breeze, A greedy gled, intent to seize, Cam' wi' a soundin' clang, And cleik't his felon claws upon A laverock, that owr the loan Sang lustilie her sang; As he wi' crabbit cruel claw That innocent did gulligaw, Some gentle cushie-dows, that saw The leesome la'rick's wae, Aff frae their sinny dow-cot whirr'd, And, lichtin' on the robber-bird, Wi' peck and straik, and dusche and dird, They forc'd and flappit to the yird That spulyier and fae: Wi' angry bill, and wing theretill, They wapp't and swapp't, and flapp't and slapp't Till, owercome at last, Leavin' his ruffian life in air, At Diston's feet he lichtet fair, Wayme uppermost, and wamblit there In deadthraw grim and ghast; The clerk took up the diein' glede, And held him sprowlin' owr his head; Than to the people cry'd, “Behauld the greedy gled o' Rome, By bills of innocents owrcome, In his ain heart's-bluid dy'd! As feckless dows hae slachter'd sae This grippin', grim, strang-talon'd fae, Sae shall we, Calvin's feckless fowls, Gie to the strumpet bluidy dools, And cast her corp among the mools: Tak' ye the omen, than, wi' joy, And,—forward!—let us to the ploy!” So speakin', heich aboon his head, He swung in air the greedy gled; The people caucht the augurie, And testified their ready glee Wi' multi-son'rous noise; And, “Let us march!” was cry'd aloud, Thorough the wide-convulsit crowd, By monie a bellerin voice. Anon, the marchin'-sign was gien; Bagpipes begoud to drunt and rair, And the town's colours, in their sheen, Wallop't and shimmer't in the air; Trumpets and drums, wi' blithsom brattel, Begoud agen to blaire and rattle, As if advancin' straucht for battle; Awa' they set wi' merry cheer; There never march'd for open weir A troop sae lifey and sae jolly, Sae little fash'd wi' melancholy. As up they travell'd, reirdin' on, Atween Pitkirie and the loan, Dan Momus, god o' lauchter, over Their hobblin' heads did hop and hover; Sometimes, owr the hail regiment glancin', Frae pow to pow he held a-dancin'; Sometimes he cock't himself upon The peak o' the town's-piper's drone; Sometimes, he grinnin', took a rest on The showther o' the stalwart Diston; Eftsoons he settlet, in a whip, On Fisher-Willie's halbert's tip; Than sought the borough's flappin' flags, And row'd himsel' amang the rags: He never blindit in his daffin', Fliskin' like fire about, and gaffin', Till to Dun-nino's upponland, Y-fere wi' that rejoicin' band He cam; whan, in a gliffin, He saw the Vicar owr the Kenly In fuffel'd garb, and plicht ungainly, Fast scamperin' and skiffin': He was a bitter Papist black, And sauld God's blessin' for a plack: This Vicar's name was Thomas Sclater. He was slain in Edinburgh some years after. Knox speaks of him. His garments he had thrown about In terrour, amaist wrang-side-out; His loose, unbutton'd, waff briek-knees Danglit in draperie round his thies; His stockins, o' het haste the types, Cam' flappin' owr his shoon in flypes: 'Tis addet, too, (sae, to this day, Douce bodies in that kintra say,) That, whan that squadron cam' in sicht Wi' bannerols and pensels bricht, Frichtsomely fleein' owr the heicht, He had been at that vera time Debarbin', wi' a razor prime, His week-negleckit beard; He saw the troop, and, at the sicht o't, He bangit up sae doons affrichtet, Ae cheek was shav'd, the tither slichtet; And aff he flew afeard: Than, hurry-scurry, hop, hop, hop, Awa' he ran withouten stop: Ahent his back he never looket, Till he was past Strathtyrum dowcot; His feet ne'er blindit aff their journey Untill they landit at Balmernie; And there he took hole like a rabbit, And denner'd gustily with th' abbot, Acquentin' him 'tween ilka gabbot, How near he 'scap't frae bein' stabbit. At a' this quakin', flichterin', rinnin', Dan Momus' face was constant grinnin', Whan, lo! upon the eastern heicht, My great-great-grandsher (Taylor hight) Appears in his braid-showther'd micht; A merrie man, and stark theretill, The tacksman o' Dun-nino mill; His house stood round ahent the hill; Owr a' the millers o' this shire His buirdly stature did aspire; And, as he by the head towr'd higher, He shone for frankness, fun, and fire; His hearthstane, swept and garnish'd clean, Wi' yill and brandie aye was bein, And rang wi' jokes baith morn and een; Merry men there were aye at hame; Whilk spread abrede my forbeir's fame: He was the first leil laick true That had read a' the Testaments throw, And had digest them well; Albeit, Dan Vicar, wi' his ban', Did blast and calumnie the man, For readin' mair at wangyle than Lord Bishop or himsel'; For Vicar's ban', or Bitesheep's bark, He had but little care or cark: Sae up he comes to join the host, (He'd got some tithand frae the coast), Wi' a' his miller-feir, Thick Jamie Bud, lang Sandy Kay, And three or four as stout as they, In coats meal-melvied, powther'd gay Wi' flows o' flour, like milky-way Whan thick sterns do appear; Dan Momus, as he did perceive My forbeir, smudgit in his sleeve. But mair he leugh, whan, frae the wast, Stravithie's laird cam' spankin' fast, To list himsel' amang that band, And chase Corruption frae the land: A laird he was, though somedeal auld, In spreit yet juvenil and bauld; Upon his face you mith discern, Written quite clear to onie bairn, A deidly hatred and a dour To Satan, arm'd wi' monkish power: He had a staff-swerd, straucht and lang, That overhead he swapt and swang, Develin' the air wi' monie a bang, Whairwi' he threaten'd, in his wraith, To dirk Diabolus to death: At him, my grandsher and the Vicar, As they march't up, and aff did bicker, The god o' gaups did laugh and smikker; He leugh sae loud, and lang, and sair, That day, he couldna laugh nae mair! Thus up, resoundin' frae the coast, Travell't that monie-wappen'd host, And keppit frae the lairdships round, And cottar-towns throu' a' that bound, Hinds, plewmen, lairds, and cottar callans, That frae their spences, ha's, or hallans, Did congregate in rairin' glee, Enarm't with airn or rung o' tree, To be partakers frank and free O' whatsome'er that weir mith be. As they cam' to the Prior-muir, And saw Sanct Androis town and towr Atween them and the sea, A wee they haltit to look down Upon the multi-towred town, That on her mountain o' renown Sat in her majestie; Her sindry steeples, shootin' high, Amid the schimmer o' the sky, They set themsels, wi' curious eye, To reckon up and tell: Her goodlie, great cathedral, spread Upon the mountain's lordlie head, In leviathan length, becrown'd I' the middle, and at ilka bound, Wi towr and spindyl turrets round, They mark'd and noted well; The gowd that glitter't on ilk spire, The capper roofs that flared like fire, Heigh sparklin' ower kirk and quire, Wi' langsame gaze they did admire: But whan they thocht upon The idolatries and sins confest, That there did brood as in their nest; The monie murder't saints that there, Thro' persecutions sharp and sair, Had to their Maker gone; How poor Paul Craw, for speakin' true, Was brunt wi' brass-ba' in his mou'; How Wishart, gentle, guid, and kind, The friend and favourite o' mankind, Had, frae her causey-crown, Ascendit upwarts frae his pyre In chariot of whirlin' fire: Ah! martyr-murderin' town! Thus thocht they in their hearts, and said And cry'd, “Aha!” and shook the head Wi' bannin' and wi' frown; “Thy end is come!” cry'd Barns aloud, “Thou Scotish Babel lewd and proud! Thou Rome o' Scotland! ah, the day Is come, or just upon its way, Whan Retribution, dour but just, Thy gawcy glorie down shall thrust, To rot amang the kirkyard dust Like carrion-corp for aye: As asks and dragons now abide Whare Babylon, in gowden pride Ance like a queen did ring; Sae whair thy altars glister now, Shall craps o' gosky dockens grow, And jag-arm'd nettles soon, I trow, The passer-by shall sting; And schule-bairns, on a future day, Shall be rampagin' in their play Whare ance thy priests, in lang array, Their matin-sangs did sing!” “As monie steeples as you see Cockin' atween you and the sea, Sae mony heads,” cry'd out the Clerk, “Cock on our Babylonish kirk; They maun be a' shorn aff and clean'd: Than fordwart ilka wangile friend! Fordwart on bishop, friar, and fiend!” This said, he northlins wagg'd his wappen, And down the hill the host gaed stappin', Wi' bagpipes blairing, banners flappin', And a' their diff'rent armours rappin': Syn auld St Rule cam' owr the sea, The hill o' Boars did never see Sae monie goodly chevalrie Toddlin' and marchin' wi' sic glee. By what time they were comin' down The Prior-acres near the town, The Sun, whase bernin' feet gae swift Skelpin' alang the marble lift, Owrspangit at ae single stend The gowden key-stane o' the pend; It was the vera ee o' the day, What time the carefu' kimmers keek Aneath the kail-pat's lid to sey The boilin' o' the beef, ere they The kettle upheese frae the kleek: It sae bechanced at that hour, That in Sanct Leonard's tapmast tower Dan George Buchanan, douce and meek, Was reading, by his windock-cheek, (After a three-hours' spele at Greek,) His Hebrew Bible richt: His ee was glidin' owr that part Whair gude Josiah, wise in heart, A bairn in wisdom wicht, Extirpate idols frae the temple, And brized lewd priests for ane ensample; And how, frae 'neath the burial-stanes, He disinterr'd their murlin' banes, And grund them into powther sma', And winnow'd them i' the wind awa'; A' this he cannilie was readin', Wi' guid sweet lear his spirit feedin', Whan to his stoundit ear there comes The blair o' trumpets and o' drums; He frae his windock keekit out To ken the reason o' the rout; He saw the crowd that made the shout Thick on the Anster road: Their borough-flags that flar'd and flap't, Their wappens' points that overtapp't The veil o' waffin' stour that wrapt That army as they yode; He kent the shape, and swaup confest O' learned Barns afore the rest, That, on his brankin' steed, Seem'd the fore-rider o' that weir, Whilst loftily his hand did rear A flag, whairon was written clear, In gowden letters breid,— Wreth, wreth! and bluidie fede and ill To the vile Strumpet on the Hill! Whairat douce George took merry cheer; For, though to him his book was dear, He liket fun nae less than lear: And mairattour, in sam' degree, As Greek and Latin liket he, He did dislike baith Pape and Deil; (Thir twa thegither sortit weil:) And aft Dan George, in mirthfu' day, Was overheard to sing and say,— “This warld's wickedness, alace! Like Janus, has a double face; The rotten Deil has ane; the tither Belangs unto the Pape his brither: Their heads are double, yet but ane Their buiks are, if I'm na' mistaen!” Nae marvel than that George was glad To see that Pape-assailin' squad: Nor laith was he, nor lang To leave his Hebrew and his lear; His shanks cam' lampin' down the stair As fast as they could spang: Nae faster ran they on the day Whan frae the Sea-tow'r, in a fray, He skeyg'd frae Card'nal's wreth away, Glad to escape his cleuks, perfay, Ere thrapple suffer'd wrang. END OF SANG SECOND. SANG THIRD. ARGUMENT. This sang sall tell o' scrimmage fell Whair Lollard folks were winners; And Papist gang, frae cudgels' bang, How they were famous rinners: Syn ane and a' in Frater-ha', How feastit weil the sinners; And ither things this ballad sings O' suppers and o' dinners. Dan George the Kinness-burn had crost, And near was comin' till that host, Whan Barns spy'd, frae his upwart place, That lamp o' learnin', George's face: For George to him was as a brither; They'd read lang Latin books thegither, And gash'd and gabb'd wi' ane anither: He, as he spy'd him, gaif command, That his hail companie should stand, And honour, as it did effeir, The man o' merriment and leir: Whairat the host upcast their caps, And hands and lungs gaif shouts and claps; The rocks and braes a' thairabout Rang wi' the echo o' that shout, Till, round the kirk-heugh, on the wave It ran to Ladie Buchan's cave. Whan they had ither greetit weil, Quo George; My brithren, true and leill! Great glee, perdie, my spreit doth feel To see your braw array; You're welcome to Sanct Androis town, T' extirpate ilka shaven crown, And batter wi' your hammers down Their idols as you may: You see them yonder, girnin' braw, Within their niches in the wa'; You needna drede to gar them fa', And kiss the ditches' dirt; Grey-freir and black, ilk devil's whelp, That in our city youff and yelp, They'll a' be better for a skelp; We'll thank you meikle for't: And in guid hour you're come, perfay, To gi'e our filthy freirs a fray; At twa o' clock they hald this day A grand solempnitie; Out to owr Ladie's Craig they gang To worship there wi' prayer and sang Their saint's auld banes, wham tempest dang Aff frae the stormie sea: Just lie in wait aside the wa', Ye'll catch them marchin' in a raw Wi' crosses, caps, and tippets braw, And rotten banes, beside; Rise and assailzie them at anes; I fain would ken if useless banes Will guard frae raps o' sticks and stanes Their bellies and their pride; I'll say nae mair, my brethren dear!— March for the ambusche and the weir; Spulzie be your's o' crosses clear; Baith rotten banes and ither gear, May wealth o' them betide! This said, the host wi' richt guid will Begoud to waigle down the hill: They cross't St Nich'las' drubbly rill; And up till th' Abbey wa' Doucely they march't in close array; And there, in ambuscado lay, Till priests and freirs, baith black and grey, Should ishue in a raw. Mean time, as dinin'-time was by, And stammachs clung, and thrapples dry, They thocht on drink and meat; Good luck it was that frae the coast The Commissariat o' that host Brocht up baith sodden flesh and roast, Though cauld, yet guid to eat; Sae frae their creels and wallets stout, Belyve they haurl'd and draggit out Great hams and legs o' sheep and nowt, And venison and veal; And down upo' the gerss they gat, And there in raws rejoicin' sat, Smaicherin' awa at lean and fat, Up-gabblin', tooth and nail: Nor did there laik delicious liquor To gar their meat gang down the quicker; For weil had they taen tent To bring up nappies strang and nice, O' ilk kinkind and ilka price, To cherish them whan faint; Their warst o' drinks was yill, the whilk Dan David Barclay drank like milk; Nor did the Piper spare it; But Fisher-Willie and the lairds To nae sic sma' drink paid regards, But wash't their gebbies and their beards In sparklin' jaws o' claret. They're comin'! cry'd a bodie out; They're comin' now—I ken their shout; Canons and freirs, and rabble-rout, Down chantin' by the mill! I hear their aves and their trumps! Cry'd Sipsies out, and up he jumps: Banes-breakin' now, and bluidy bumps! Exclaims the clerk,—Hae done wi' rumps; Up halbert now and bill! Up frae the gerss their arms they get, And craftilie their buschment set On ilk side o' the southern yett In hidlins near the wa': Ready, whan that the train cam out, T' assailzie them wi' clour and clout, And play their batterin'-rams about Upon the bellies braw: They were nae lang in comin' down; Cornets and caps, and cornets soon, Grey-freir and black wi' shaven crown, Tippit, and chesybil, and gown, Cam gushin' like a stream, Wi' trumps and cymbals soundin' high, And chanters skirlin' in their cry, And banners owr their heads that fly, And tapers bleezin' up the sky, Makin' the gowden sun envy The dazzle and the gleam: Without the yett they were na lang, Whan, frae their buschment in a bang, Uprase that army, thick and strang, Wi' halyballoo and shout; Crail's merry clerk the war-sign gaff; He was the first wi' aiken staff To chastify freir Tullidaff, That bure on high the gowden calf, The idol o' that rout: The saint's auld relics wi' the strokes Were stricken frae their cedar-box; Barrow and banes wi' kicks and knocks Were daddit round about; Then, hirie-harie! folks did rusch; Then rag'd the scrimmage and strabusch; Crail vy'd wi' Anster at the brusch; Was ne'er sic bickerin'-bout! The aiken rungs on backs did batter; The clods and stanes on crowns did clatter; Bellies, the heicher they were and fatter, Were dunsched in and grus'd the flatter, Wi' mickle pyne, but doubt: Trumps, tapers, tippets, a' were marr'd; In skrieghs the singers voices jarr'd; The bagpipes, late that pantit hard, Were chok't for want o' breath; Sic hubbub and sic hubble-shew, As scamper't aff the frichtet crew! The grey-freir gap'd, the black-freir blew; The canon scream'd, the shavelin' flew, As if 'tween life and death: And some ran ae gate, some anither; Some northlins, southlins; some in swither Ran first the tae gate, than the tither, Glad to escape by any whither That herriment and scaith. John Tottis, though he fain would rin, He couldna budge a single shin; For Messer Barclay had him grippet Ticht by the belt, and haurl'd his tippet, And birs'd his beirdly pensch and nippit: Whairat the grey-freir, Johnnie Tottis, Wi' bernin' indignation hot is; Twa wee bit bodies they were baith, But whan their bluid was up in wreth, As birsy's bears, and mad for scaith; They warslet teuch wi' gurlie grapple; They ettlet fierce at ither's thrapple: They dunch'd wi' knees and elbucks baith; Till, at the last, depreev'd o' breath, They plumpit down frae whare they stood, Amang the harbour's sludge and mud; They row'd thegither in the slunk; Their heads were up, their bodies sunk; What wi' the slusch they ate and drunk, I wat, Dan Barclay's vital spunk Had soon been dead and gane; But Oliphant ('twas sae decreed) Rax'd his lang arm in nick o' need, And, grippin' Barclay by the heid, (As fisher hauls a cod indeed,) Upheez'd him safe again; I trow, he was weel slim'd and soakit; Great dads o' sludge amaist him chokit, As ever and aye his mou outbockit The waters he had taen; But Johnnie Tottis, feckless bodie, Lay wallowin' in mis'ry muddy; Men help't him not; but (throu' the saints) He flounder't owr untill the Bents; Loud gaups o' lauchter shook the bank, As Johnnie slaister'd throu' the stank. But whan that broillerie was dune, Baith Erth below and Heaven abune Bare witness to that tuilzie; For Heav'n was dim wi' stoury cluds That up had risen wi' the thuds, And Erth was strawn wi' rags and duds, The battle's divers spuilzie: Here lay a cross; and here the tippet Whairwi' wee John had been equippit; Wide copes, great hoods a' riv'n and rent, And scapularies scuff'd and shent, And knottit girdles queer and quaint, Lay hither-thither on the bent; Bagpipes lay bit and bit asunder; The drone was here, the chanter yonder; A book was here, and there a bell, A missal and a scallop-shell; Tapers yet smeekin' on the stanes Mixt wi' the saints' auld reekit banes; The barrow's blads dash'd round about; A trump, a taburine, and clout O' Tullidaff's lang gown: The Lollard host had heartsom glee The ruins o' that fecht to see; And monie a gaulp and loud tehee Resoundit up and down: Fy! fy! cry'd Dan Buchanan out, Gae, gather up, ye impious rout, The saints' black banes that under foot Lie trodden as you see: Aiblins, upon some future day, Yon henckle-bane, though mouldie, may Be a Palladium in a fray To guard baith you and me: Nae sooner said, than Piper Jock, Wi' wicket murgeonin' and mock, Pick't up the banes that lay like brock, And clappit them intill ane poke. Their host thairafter did return Till their first lair by Kinness-burn; Thair lookin' up, whan Sipsies saw The marble mawments carvit braw Stuck in their niches i' the wa', A gloomie gluntch shot he; I wot, he cry'd, 'tis now the hour To mak yon ladies feel our power, And bring them, in a stany shower, Tumblin' frae whair you see: This said, he summon'd soon thegither His regiment (a jolly futher!) The wabsters o' the town o' Crail, Men ferdy-limb'd and swank and hale, Whase hearts had soukit all and haill The pith o' parritch and cauld kaill: Instead o' helm or morrion, Thir weirlike wabsters everilkon Had ane Kilmarnock nicht-cap on, That flamit like the settin' son: And round his head ilk ane held swappin' A timmer treadle for a wappen: Whan he beheld his yeomanrie, Their eagerness and energie, And how they toss't their arms on hie, He thus accostit them: My lads! Ye see yon girnin' Romish jads, Provokin' you to gi'e them dads, And tumble them i' the ditches: Let us divide our troop in twa; Ilk half gang raikin round the wa', Ane north, the tither westlins ga Displenishin' the niches: Let the haill dyke be purgit clean; Ae virgin mair be never seen!— Farewell! we'll meet at Greg'ry's green, In half an hour or thairabout: Sae speakin', he began th' attack; He raucht his halbert up, and brack An image that stood starin' out; She devel'd down a hideous wrack, Her head dissociate frae her back; In splendirs flew the stane about: Thairat, the soldiers o' his band, Seein' their master's micht o' hand, Ramstam flew ragin' aff; Some to the left, some to the richt, To soop the wa's wi' a' their micht, Ilk wabster wi' his staff; Nae mercy than for Papish Maries; In flinders flew the carv't fleegaries; Some hit the head, and some the showther, Some pash'd at ance the pow to powther; Sic clamahewits and sic baffs Were never rain'd frae feckless staffs; In twenty minutes, less or mair, Of a' the idols lately there Pitcht on that Abbey wa', A man mith rax his een in vain Ere he could spy upon a stane An idol heich or law; Sic cleanly wark, and sae perfyte, Wi' chappin'-sticks that sair did smyte, Crail's merrymen did mak; Crown'd wi' red nicht-caps they gaed out, But wi' Victoria's joyfu' shout Cam crown'd wi' glory back! Mean time throu' Priorie and town The monster Fame gaed up and down As fast as she could post; (Her feet laigh on the causey paikin'; Her head amang the thin clouds raikin', Heigh, heigh aboon Salvador's steeple,) Yelpin' aloud to a' the people The tidings o' that host; The monie thousand gabs, within The plumes, that sur-invest her skin Gaed clatterin' and clashin'; Ae gapin' gab did utter true; Great lies gush'd frae anither mou': A third wi' baith kept gashin': Like squibs and crackers fired aft, You mith hae heard them up alaft Sound owr ilk chimla-tap: What wi' their yammerin' and din, Lord Prior James, that sat within His palace, maist frae out his skin Wi' awsome terrour lap; Chiefly i' th' Priorie and round it Th' alarms and yellochins resoundit; For frae yon fecht that fell, The frichten't freirs cam in about, Fleein' wi' panic-skriegh and shout, Their faces white as linen clout, Bearin' the story o' their rout To cloyster, ha', and cell: Ilk fae they saw, ilk baff they gat Was by their fricht exaggerat; They tauld how that they met A regiment o' giants bauld, Like to the Anakims of auld, Wi' clubs and wappens manifauld For deadlie battle set; And some on faemy horses rode, Whase manes, bedreepit red wi' blood, Splash't draps o't i' their een; In iron boots some walk't afoot; On dragons some flew round about; There never was in Fife but doubt Sic fleysome warriours seen: As prief o' which Sanct Rule's dear banes Were left to rot amang the stanes: A mercy on us, cry'd Dean Annan, We're gane—our kirk's nae langer stannin'! Our anchor's lost, scream'd John Arbuckle, We're perish'd a', baith sma' and muckle! Amid this dridder and this flurry, St Magdalen's big bell in a hurry Begoud to reissle hurry-scurry: That jowin' jangle was the ca' For th' Abbey people, ane and a', To congregate i' th' Frater-ha': 'Twas hour o' dine or thereabout; Hunger was i' their wambes nae doubt, But terrour, too, was round about; And terrour garr'd them loup pell-mell Frae senzie-house, kirk, court, and cell, In omne-gatherum at that bell; As whan the bees some day in June Stravaig frae risin' sun till noon; If mirky clouds in th' afternoon Come stowfin' up the west, Hear they but anes the thunner-claps, And in the leaves the plouterin' draps, They gi'e their sma' wings sudden claps, And hurry hamewarts to their scaps For cozy skoug and rest; Sae did that Abbey people a' Effrey't flee to the Frater-ha', Canon, and monk, and dean, and prior, And batie-bum, and beggin' freir, A congregation wode wi' fear, Though fat, in dulesome dreiry cheir: The porch ne'er witness't sic a flither; They pous'd, they jundy'd ane anither; Their wambes afftimes were jamm'd thegither; Mair space they had i' th' ha', though thrang!— It was a dainty room and lang; (I am a man of five feet three; 'Twas twenty times the length o' me:) Guid hap, their dinner then was laid Upon the tables lang and braid, Wi' damask napery owrspread; And gowden trunscheors like the moon, Wi' correspondin' fork and spoon; A wilderness o' meat was set; Sea, soil, and sky, were here a' met; Fish, flesh, and fowl, baith cauld and het; And florentines, and pies, and tarts, Rang'd here and there in sindry parts, And sauces, soups, and geills, and creams, Up-stowfin' to the roof their steams, Wi' bonnie fruitage, ripe and red, In silverised baskets spread: And siller jugs and stoups divine O' malvesie and claret-wine, Shimmering like suns in order fine: Temptation reel'd in tass and bicker, Dancin' divinely 'mang the liquor; It wad a Nazarite provokit To break his vow and tak a bok o't, Untill his hail-life's drowth were slockit: Had I been there that nicht, I think, Though I'm a man o' little drink, I wadna been sae doons perjink; But taen an over-loup for sport:— I'd got the Paip's indulgence for't! Whan they were a' forgadder't there, Lord Prior James got on a chair, And cry'd, A truce to elrisch fricht! Let's dine, my friends, and that outricht; Fu' stamach maks faint heart mair rvicht; And of a' sorrows, it's confest, A sorrow that is fu' 's aye best: Sae down they cloytet on their seats, And helter-skelter at the meats; As Lybian lions, that on prey Licht, after danderin' monie a day, Ramsch skin, flesh, bane, e'en sae did they; As windmill blades, whan wind does happen, Rin reeshlin' round and round, and rappin', While, ever as the shafts gae swappin', The grindin'-graith below gaes clappin'; Sae quick, or rather mickle quicker, Their chaft-blades back and fore did bicker; Baith jaws; as if they vy'd thegither, Sae quiver'd, nae man could tell whether Gaed faster, th' upper or the nether; Nor waur their lungs for wauchts were giftit; The siller stoups on heigh upliftit Were tootit in a whip and tiftit; Eat-weil, they say, is drink-weil's brither; Or rather, ane may say, its mither; But ca' it either tane or tither, That nicht they were leisch'd in thegither; Had Epicurus sell been waitin' Upon them as they pang'd their meat in, He couldna weil hae blam'd the eatin'; Had Bacchus sell been there, I'm thinkin', For pumpin' bottles and for skinkin', He couldna weil hae blam'd the drinkin': Sae what wi' tootin', what wi' eatin', Their hearts, whan they had got some heat in, Were stapt frae duntin' and frae beatin'. Lord Prior James again uprase; Ah, by Sanct Mary bricht! he says, Me had thir Lollards no distrubill'd, My denner had been nearly doubl'd; Yet it is marvel nae the less, That we hae made sae guid a mess, Considerin' how our Sanct's dear banes, Under whase shade we denner'd anes, Lie now out bleachin' on the stanes: Ah, wae is me! sic heavy dule Ne'er yet hath happen't to Sanct Rule; The storm that dang him frae the deep, Upon our tangly skellies steep, Was naething to the tempest black Frae that oultrageous Lollard-pack; That maks his banes to-day a wrack: The barbare rocks that caught him than In mercy, sav'd the haly man; But this rock-heartit crew o' Luther Will persecute his banes to powther; Unless we do devise some means Whereby to vindicate the banes; And skail that mad ill-gainshon'd byke O' Test'ment-men that doth us fyke, To Anster back or Cellardyke: Whasa than can devise a way, Let him up-speik as best he may, For de'il haet mair hae I to say. He sat him down to birl and quaff; And up to speik rase Tullidaff; I swear by him that made the moon! The menzie o' that German loon Hae pykin' been at this my gown, And made ae flype their plunder; (So sayin', up to view he gaff His lang-gown wi' its flype torn aff; The ha' resoundit wi' a lauff To see it rent asunder;) Yet, though my vestment thus be rent, Sanct Geil! my spreit is yet unshent; Thir scoundrels o' the Testament I challenge them ilk ane; If no for Latin or for lear, At least to joust or break a spear, And fecht them butten fricht or fear Upon the gerssy plain: This vera nicht I sall send out My bauld defiance to the rout; Cheise they a champion steeve and stout To battle for their wangill; I, in my coat of airn or bress, Sall stand to battle for the Mess, And for our injur'd kirk's redress Sall tuilzie like an angel; And let the fecht's conditions be; If their priev'd knicht owr-tirvie me, Keep they the banes but strife or plea Whilk this day they hae cleiket; If I, wi' help o' Mary bricht, Dumfounder to the death their knicht, Let them gie back their relics richt Within their cophine steekit; I hae na better rede to gie; If you hae better deal it free; Gin this is best, than, tak frae me And use the counsel as you may: He scarce had endit, whan a gabble O' tongues and raps upo' the tabill, Frae that wine-flister't ribble-rabbill, Announcit loud how acceptabill Was Tullidaff's gude say. Whan Tullidaff was dune wi' stannin', Than up to his shanks gat John Annan; Quoth he, “You're vera richt in plannin' How to rescue the banes; But by Sanct Fillan! think alswa How to rebut and schue awa Thir damnit faes that siege our wa' Wi' wappens for the nanes; Send forth a messenger to carry The tidings to the Regent Mary; Tell her o' a' this fiery-farie, Uprisen round our town; And bid her and Lord Bishop send Frae Falkland, whair they now attend, A troop o' jackmen to defend His mitre and her crown; Sae sall this vile canallyie-host Be huntit downwarts to the coast; And duds and flypes that hae been lost Be found again richt soon.” He scarce had ceas'd, whan John Arbuckle Upon the tabill dang his knuckle, And cry'd,—“I chap this thing; Mine be the embassage to carry To guid Lord Bishop and Queen Mary The tithand o' this fiery-farie, And jackmen thence to bring.” Up-spak Lord Prior James: “I trow, Twa strings are best aye to ane's bow; I do apprieve that John Arbuckle, Bein' a man o' courage muckle, Himsel up for this bus'ness buckle: Mean time, at ilka abbey-yett, Let guards and sentries round be sett; And be ilk tow'r and turret mann'd Wi' michty warriours out-o'-hand, That frae nocturnal 'sault may stent Thir rybalds o' the Testament.” He spak, and instant a' the senzie Did ratifie it without plenzie; Apprieval rang loud frae their menzie. Whilst they i' th' Priorie this-gate Were gain' on at sic a rate Wi' clamour and wi' feast, Nae less the burghers throu' the town Were yelpin', skelpin', up and down, Contrair the Roman beast: For now Conspiracie stalk't out Nakit, without a gyzin-clout, Red-wud for some destruction-bout; Frae the Wast-port to Greg'ry's-green, Was naething heard and naething seen, But tongue-strabush and war; The Market-street did, like a Babel, Wi' bladderand bodies yaup and yabble; The South-street gowl'd wi' gibble-gabble, The North-street meikle waur; The wynds were claikin' wi' the clatter; The Foul-waste bumm'd wi' blitter-blatter; Tongues never wi' sic clitter-clatter Did jangle and did jarr; Wives fir'd and frenzy'd up the men; The men inflam'd the wives agen; Schule-bairns, withouten shoe or cape, Gaed skirlin' treason 'gainst the Pape; Auld folks, that scarce could girn or gape, At Papistry did gleek and jaip: The douce professors in their gowns Stood preachin' on the causey-crowns, And the puir students, (fractious lowns!) At ilka college-yett, To paternosters, fiends and freirs, Proclaimit mad and mortal weirs, Ere that the sun be set: They spacier'd back and fore in bands, Wi' lowin' sticks intill their hands, Threat'nin' to hurl the bernin' brands, And pay the de'il his debt; Till ane i' the College-wynd cry'd out, “Aha! what deil are we about, Tossin' our heads wi' yell and youtt, Like Hannibal's fire-puttin' nowt, For nocht but idle schaw? Let's down to meet the southern host, And greet the heroes frae the coast;— Awa'—there's nae time to be lost;— Aff, birkies, ane and a'!” Incontinent he took' his heels; And after him an hundred chiels, As hallockit and rais'd as de'ils, Ran hirdie-girdie skirrin'; “Hurra!” they yellochit a' throuther; “Hurra! Lear, Libertie, and Luther!” And split the crowd wi' shank and showther, Like bombard-shot a-birrin'; The rabble, whan they saw them rin, To follow too did straucht begin; And eastlins, like a rairin' linn, Ran down the South-street whirrin': Tam Pethrie's horse, a scurvy hack, Wi' lades o' camstane on his back, In the Eastburn-wynd was stannin'; Camstane and creels, and Tam and horse, Were overturnit by their force, As if wi' sweep o' cannon; And down they rushet like a jaw Alangside o' the Abbey-wa', Till, comin' near the burn, they saw The southern host outspread, Busk'd in the abuilyiements o' weir, Ensenyies waffin' lang and clear, And hallbert tall, and lance and speir, Hie glitterin' owr their head; Whairat they gat up wi' a shout, Strathtyrum rattlet round about: Had Luther's sonsy sell been seen Stappin' alang St Nich'las' green, A greater joy there couldna been Than what did then befa', As intill ithers' arms they rush't, And hands were shaken, hearts were flush't, And blobs o' joyous tears outgush't Beside that Abbey-wa'. Mean time the sun's red steeds had haurl'd To the north-wastern side o' th' warld His fiery-wheelit car; The isles o' Lewis and o' Sky Lay blinkin' in the beams that fly Out frae their nastrills far; And now ae mament they did rest On Hecla's frost-becrystall'd breast Their trachlet feet a wee, Ere that they left the heevinly pend, And lap wi' ane prodigious stend Aneath the warld intill the sea: And Hawkey now, weel sair'd wi' food, Within the byre forwearyt stood, Whilst Grizzy maks the pails to flutter Wi' torrents ominous o' butter. The plewman frae his day-lang swink Lay restin' on the kitchen-bink, Richt glad his fire-hung pat to hear Singin' and dringin', token clear That merry parridge-time was near. Sanct Salvador had frae his tower Clankit aught straiks to tell the hour; And, by that time, the host that lay Encampit near the Kirkheugh brae, What wi' the town's-folks thick and thrang, And ither re-enforcements strang, That a' that simmer e'enin' lang Cam' draiglin' in wi' arms, Had gather't and increasit sae, That the hail space that stretchit frae The Abbey-park to Kirkheugh-brae Was bizzin' wi' the swarms: As bees, whan simmer overheaps The population o' the skapes, Aft emigrate and flee in heaps To garden-bush and flower; Sae thick they owr the fulzies stalk, The gard'ner, as he taks his walk, Scarce kens agen his fav'rite stalk Wi' clusters cleedit owr; E'en sae the space frae th' Abbey-park, Round to the Heugh and Dennis-wark, Was crawlin' wi' sae pang a mass, You scarce could see a spat o' grass. As now the moon had got the upper, They 'gan to think upon their supper: And supper frae the city cam' Creakin' in carts, whase tree and tram Wi' bangs o' beef and hills o' ham Did tremble and did crack; Hurlbarrows, filled to their taps Wi' saxpence laifs, and cakes, and baps, Were haurlit down by baxter-chaps That vivers mith na' lack; And carters' sleds heapt bonnily Wi' bacon-hams baith round and high And kebbucks curlin' to the sky Came draiglin' down the street: E'en Tammie Pethrie's wrackit mare, Had gather't to her feet ance mair, And chang'd her camstane for a skair O belly-timber sweet; And Berwick's yill-carts were asteer, Rumblin' wi' barls o' michtie beer; That nicht his hogsheads were na sweer To rattle tow'rd the shore; And ilka wine-booth thro' the town Threw out her bottles to the moon; Sic fludes o' liquor ne'er flow'd down The Eastburn-wynd before; Weel you may see that siegin' host Had skaff and skink withouten cost; Sae down they fell to boil'd and roast Upon the bonnie gerss; They didna stick for forks and knives; Ilk man at's pleasure rugs and rives; As if frae death to save their lives They swallow'd fast and fers; And sic the flitter and the flutter, O' multitude o' mous that smoutter, A man mith weel had heard the clutter, And soundin' o' their chafts, A mile ayont the Kenly-watter; My faith, it was nae mincin' matter; There never was sic chaft-blade blatter On hairst-rigs or on crafts. END OF SANG THIRD. SANG FOURTH. ARGUMENT. Frae Tullidaff, a challenge bauld Is sent out to the host; Arbuckle, back by sutors haul'd, Is in a blanket toss't; Out to the Scores baith young and auld To see the joustin' post; A battle then is sung or tauld Whairin sma' bluid is lost. As on the Heugh, hard by the yett, The captains o' the host were sett, And round their burde on cauld and hett Were suppin' lustily; (Nae licht o' candle needit they For yet the gowden tail o' day Sweipt wi' its never-settin' ray The rim o' th' Arctic sky; And, mairattour, intill the East, To see the frolick o' the feast, Keek'd out, in silver cymarre drest, The jollie-cheekit moon, And owr the sea, and owr the sky, And owr Sanct Androis steeples high, Flang frae her lap rejoicinglie Goupins o' glory down; The table round the whilk they sat, The wine-cups whilk they tootet at, Their vera faces radiance gat Frae her warld-fillin' blaze;) As they were pykin' thus and piddlin', And wine-dubs round and round were driddlin', Behauld! amid the sound o' fiddlin', The Abbey-yett upgaes; And frae it there did issue out Sax fiddlers playin' merry bout, And them ahent a herald stout, In green and yellow claes; At's mou' he had a trumpet braw, Whairwi' he 'gan to roust and blaw: Ha, heretics! I'm come to ca' Your ferdiest to the fecht; Sir Tullidaff, the warden-freir, Albeit a feckless cuif at leir, Yet a terrific cairl in weir, A man o' buik and wecht, Doth by this mou' o' mine defy The steevest o' your host, to try In single fecht, till either die, The merit o' your wangill; Hae ye your man by acht o' clock, A' frack and furnish't for the shock, Wi' him, Sir Freir, in iron frock, Sall tuilzie like an angel: And let the fecht's conditions be, If gude Sir Tullidaff sall die, Keep you the banes but strife or plea Whilk this day ye hae cleikit; If he, wi' help o' Mary bricht, Dumfounder to the death your knicht, Do ye restore the relics richt Within their cophine steekit:— Jimp time he took to steek his mou', Whan on the table down he threw Ane birrin' gauntlet down; A dozen glasses by the mitten Were into shivers smash'd and smitten; Their wine flew to the moon; Up-sprang, wi' riot and wi' rippat, A dozen angry men to grip it, The Fisher-Knicht and Barns, Fierce Sipsies, glumshin' in his wreth, Clerk Diston, almost out o' breath, And Innergellie, with an aith, Attestin' moon and starns, That, as he was a champion fittin', His was the combat, his the mitten:— Hald, hald your tirrivee, Cry'd Dan Buchanan frae his seat, To end this pley, and this debate, Take Homer's canny classic gate, (A wily wight was he!) E'en get a hat, and clap therein Your names writ down withouten din, And them a' throwther whummel; And whatsomever o' them a' Our master-skinker first shall draw, That be the man wham it sall fa' This furious freir to hummel; They gat a hat, and clapt therein Their names writ down withouten din, And whummel'd them a' throwther; The skinker, servin' at their back, Shov'd in his hand to pick and tak A champion out for Luther; Behauld! the vera first he picket (Luck rul'd it sae!) was Diston's ticket; He read it by the moon; Clerk Diston's name is on the label; Clerk Diston, soundit round the table, A man mair stalrvart, steeve, and stable, To drive the freir to the Diable, Couldna be singlet soon: Up frae his seat the not'ry bowtit; “My arms!” he to the welkin shoutit; “My spear! my swerd! nae mair about it; I'm for the battle bown; De'il may I perish in my fecket, By some bauld tailzeour's bodkin pricket, If I'se na soon exhibit sticket (Maugre Sanct Rule and Tam-a-Becket) This braggin' lurdoun loun:” And as he spak, there fell as proof That instant frae Hevin's spangly roof A starn o' shootin' licht, That frae the zenith's tapmast crown Gaed scrievin' clean across the moon; And in the bay gaed divin' down That mament out o' sicht; They kent the omen, and they clappit Their hands as down the fire-ba' drappit. Mean time Arcturus, that on hie Glisters beside Bootes' knee, Like ane knee-buckle bricht, Had been, for twa guid hours and mair, Westlins o' Dairsie's forest fair, A-chasin' Berenice's hair, Scarce seen for simmer's licht; Syn they sat down to their repast, A sign and half a sign had past Across the mid-day straik, whairon Astraddle rides the gowden sun: And Morpheus, now i' th' lift did ramp, Down drizzlin' frae his feathers damp His sleepy dew-draps owr their camp: Forfairn' wi' toil, and drink, and sangs, And antipapal douce harangues, The siegers fell asleep in bangs Upon the gressy ground; Excepting' here an antrin fiddle, And yonder, in the vera middle, A diein' bagpipe's sound; Nae din kept soughin' i' the sky To tell th' unpillow'd crowds that lie Souffin' and sloomin' round; To Barns then up-spak Fisher-Willie; Methinks it's richt, my learnit billie! Syn baith the Bears now shine ill-willie Growlin' at our carouse; To think o' dortours and o' beds, Whairon to rest our legs and heads, Till Tullidaff us rouse: Quoth Barns, Hech! what would Luther think To see us as we sit and wink, Amid sic daffery and drink! Up, then, and let us aff! Lest that our Papish enemie Should keek outowr the wa' and see How daintilie we daff! Up than, as fast as they were able, They bangit endlang frae the table, And spers'd about in search o' beds Throu' houses, hostillars, and sheds, Whairon to rest their heavie heads. Whan they were streiket down for naps, They slummer'd on like vera taps, The sounder for their claret-draps: Except the walkrife clerk, wha lay Doverin' and dreamin' on till day, O' fechts, and feuds, and bluidy rackets, And bucklin' habrihones and jackets, And Tullidaff, afore his sicht, Girnin' and gapin' like a wicht Murder't, whase saul was on the flicht; In brief, the harrens o' the clerk Were sae commovit wi' the werk O' harnessin' and weir; That in his reelin' saul ae thocht O' parchment or o' peace was nocht, For dreams o' strife and steir! As in and round the town they sleepit, Than frae his cloister hidlins creepit, Brimfu' o' zeal and courage muckle, That michtie envoy, John Arbuckle, On his ambassiate to carry The tidings to the guid Queen Mary Of a' this siege's fierie-farie; And fetch frae Falkland's palace auld A bang o' Frenchmen big and bauld, To prick, wi' bayonet and pike, Thae hereticks that did them fyke, Backlins to Crail and Cellardyke: He frae the Abbey's wastern yett Had scapit sly withouten lett; And now, ayont the town, Was distant nearly half a mile, Zig-zaggin', wi' great tent and toil, Through the thick middens of Argyle Suburb of St Andrews, so called. Gilt glorious by the moon: Whan frae ane little yill-house near, That shone wi' candles glimmerin' clear, Five Anster sutors in a steir, Inflamit wud wi' Berwick's beer, Rush't reel-rall owr the street; And claucht at random on the freir; I wat, he soon was put in fear; His skrilles, and skriechs, and skellochs dreir, Maugre his cloak's deceit, Made soon th' ambassadour to kythe; Whairat the tipsy sutors blyth Gat out their nippers straucht, And, wi' their iron grapples, grippit His flesh, and unto troublance nippit, Garrin' him scream a hideous rippet; As aye they hotch'd and laucht; Untill the pangs o' back and thie Made frae his saul the cork to flee; And a' the secrets frank and free O' that Guise-fleechin' ambassie Cam gushin' frae his mou'; Than wox the saucy sutors glad, And bad their captive be na 'fraid; Him they'd convoy, without debaid, To whair he should, for what he said, Get guerdon as was due; They dragg't him to the Fisher-Knicht; (Wham up they rapt ere mornin'-light;) They tauld their captive's fenzied plight, His journey and its drift; “E'en tak a blanket,” quoth the Knicht, “At ilka corner plant a wicht; Mak the thief wallop out o' sicht Reboundin' up the lift; Till 'mid the starns he stick and settle Atween the Great Bear and the Little: Sae punish'd be the man that gangs To bring out Guise's bluidy bangs 'Gainst his puir countrymen for wrangs!” They gat a braid, strang, dainty blanket; Ae wicht at ilka neuk stood plantit; The fifth man took his stance aloof To mark whan i' the starry roof Th' ambassadour should stick; They whummel'd him to heevin' alaft; Ten times he birr'd up; but as aft Amid the keppin' garment saft His buik reboundit quick; Ilk time they garr'd him upwarts bicker, Erthlins he tummil'd down the quicker; The aftener he to heevin' cam naur, He seem'd to hate it aye the waur; Untill the sutor-folk at length Wi' flings fortravail'd and forfairn', Found to the wastin' o' their strength He would na stick and be a stern! Whilst near Sanct Androis town this wark O' blanket-heezies stout and stark Was gaen on in th' Abbey-park; Lo! on the heevinly plain Twa heathen gods were seen thegither Scrievin' awa wi' ane anither; The god Bacchus. that had a double mither, And she Minerva. that had na nane; Quoth he, “Perdie, I'm vext to see A worshipper maist dear to me Yonder out-owre the siller sea About to daur the death;” Quoth she, “Perfay, I'm vext likewise To see ane clerk wham I do prize Resolvit soon in Mars's guise To jeopardie his breath:” Quoth he, “Do you then tak guid tent Your parchment weriour be na shent; My bottle-champion, be it kent, Nae dammishment shall dree:” Quoth she, “Do you then look till't weel Your drinkin' wicht 'scape head and heel; My witty clerk frae straiks o' steel, I warrant, sall 'scape free:” Thus they up in the sky thegither, Claver'd awa wi' ane anither. But soon the red-hair'd maid, that sleeps With her auld grasshopper Tithonus. i' th' deeps, Keek'd upwarts thro' the rowin' sea, And saw the Hours wi' gigglin' glee Thrang harnessin' the steeds, that bear Her bernin' chariot throu' the air; Up hurry-scurry in her sark She spangit for her daily dark; She was in sic a flichterin' fricht, Lest she should hender mornin'-light, She took nae time to girdle richt Her jupes about or gown; But naket (save her sark) and bare, She skeygit uplins throu' the air; And, mountin' up her chaise's chair, Drave aff her horses soon; Apollo leugh, and shook his sides As aff in naket glore she rides; E'en Jove himsel', wi' roguish eye, Keek't through a peep-hole in the sky To see her, jiggin' truttie-trottie Without her jupes or little-coatie. The day-daw scarce begoud to glisten, Whan frae his pallet up-sprang Diston; The windocks scarce wi' beams did lauff, Whan bangit up Sir Tullidaff; Twa ferdy faes, destin'd ere nicht To try ilk ither's utmost micht, For makin' baith their sauls tak flicht. Ilk had ane omen to betaken The doom that owr his pow was shakin': As Tullidaff drew 'up his brieks, Ilk button that his finger seeks. As if forleitet by its steeks, Upon the flure down-drappit; The mair he fummelt and he fykit, Fient haet ae button would keep sticket, Sae that his garment, wild and wicket, Aye at his heels did flap; Whairas, e'en o' their ain accord, The Clerk's, as gin they kent their lord, Stole up without a single heeze, And cannilie, unto his thies, Did circumjack and clap! Envestet were thir warriours baith Soon in their buliements and graith; (The warden's trunk-hose to his fecket Wi' gowden corken-priens was pricket:) Whan they were clad in claise and shoon, To diff'rent things they turnit soon, To pit their sauls in better tune: Sir Freir began wi' blitter-blatter His pray'rs to saints to pitter-patter, And muse on mass and haly watter; But Diston, butten fear or flutter, To fit him for the battle's clutter, Betook himsel' to rows and butter. Let's leave them thair at mass and meat, And look about anither gate; Sanct Salvador's lang strappan steeple Had peltit five hours to the people; The streets were fu' o' mornin'-licht, And windocks' lozens yellow-bricht Wi' blinks back-bleezin' on the sicht: Whan the town-crier wi' his clap Gan throu' the streets to reird and rap; And the town's-drummer wi' his drum Begoud to brattle and to bum; And the town's-piper wi' his drone Garr'd sleep frae ilk ee-lid be gone: First the tae man, and than the tither, And sometimes a' the three thegither, Yammer't upon the causey-crowns; Ho! men and wives, and student-lowns! Auld folk and bairns, and learnit gowns! Up frae your lazy beds, and see The jollie justing and the spree Upon the Scores about to be! Whairat baith learnit and unlearnit bodies About them rapplet fast their duddies, And, headlins hurryin' frae their doors, Out-ran in thousands to the Scores; As fast as waters frae a spout, Dickeman's-wynd spew'd hundreds out; Great bangs the Castle-wynd out-bockit; The Butts wi' bodies maist was chokit; Sic hobblin', hurryin', and happin', Wi' elbucks jundyin' and rappin', Coat-tails and women's gowns flip-flappin', At fair or sermon ne'er did happen: Bar'l-belly'd men and great-wambe women Stood jammit i' the Butts, and screamin', Till, wi' their batterin'-rams afore them, They smash't the smaiks that maist did smore them: Lean skraes o' men, and sclender wives, Were glad to get out wi' their lives: But in the Castle-wynd mair space And breidth they had to run their race: In brief, wi' bodies fleein', flittin', The town seem'd desolation-smitten; Nae livin' thing, save cat or kitten, Upon the lanely hearth-stane sittin': Nae toomer was the city, than Whan the great laird o' Montalban, On his Boyardo fair and fleet, Past the Wast-port, and up the street Rade on—in mickle maze I ween, For fient ae face was to be seen In windocks or at doors; Baith great and little, a' were out To see the famous tiltin'-bout 'Tween Ariodant and Lurcan stout Upon the grassy Scores. See Orlando Furioso, 5th Canto. The heralds had the rink-room metit, The barriers set, and lists completit; And gapin', glowrin', round about, Wi' skirl, and skry, and rallion-shout, Stood thick and far the rabble-rout; As whan a fisherman, some day In August, near the Isle o' May, Lichts on a skull o' herrings thick, mid whase millions, flikkerin' quick, His coble seems to stand and stick; As far as he can cast his een, Guid fish and sea are only seen; The finny folk, as if in daffin', Out-loup upon his ee-brees baffin'; He, in his glad heart, fa's a-lauffin', And blesses Neptune for sic skaffin'. Sae thick, around the rink-room, stood That monie-headit multitude: The heralds were nae little fash'd To keep the lists frae bein' crash'd By waves o' folk that drave and dash'd. At length a trumpet in the wast Was heard out-bellerin' a blast; And, in a jiffie, ere it ceas'd, Anither beller'd in the east: The crowd, distract at ilka blast, Look't ae-half east, the tither wast; And eastlins, lo! there did appear Heich on a steed, that nicker'd clear, Sir Tullidaff, the michtie freir, Waggin' in's hand a ten-fit speir: He was enguardit, fore and back, By Papist-priests, a rotten pack, Canons and freirs, baith grey and black; On ilka hand there wagg't and wav'd Shav'n-crowns, clean clipt, and trigly shav'd, That glisten'd in the mornin'-licht Like marble knublocks burnish't bricht, Or rowan-stanes upon the shore, Amang the jaws that splash and roar: Mairfurth, their wembes had sic a wecht, Walkin' to them was but a fecht; At ilka stap they puff't and pecht: Tippets were there, cowls, cornets, caps, Rockets, and lang-gowns wi' their flaps; The Paip's ain livery, gawcy-gay, Frae a' the cloisters' kists that day Shone out in Tullidaff's array: This in the east;—but in the wast Nae less a pomp cam' streamin' fast: The Clerk on's battle-horse, Wi' a' his merrymen defendit, That in a huddle round attendit, Burghers, and lairds, and plewmen blendit, And royat bairns that spang'd and stendit Wi' a' their micht and force: Him, as he rode on in the middle, Encompass't men wi' pipe and fiddle, That garr'd resound maist a' the widdle, Skrieghin' and screedin' fiddle-diddle: Aye, as they saw at ilka stap His spear to waver and to wap, As if for laik o' fae to stick Auld girnin' Juno to the quick, Their craigs wi' gaulps did rattle; What wi' the scraighs o' lauchter there, And janty faces shinin' fair, 'Twas clear they were the men o' lear; And Luther's glad ghaist in the air Gaed wi' them to the battle. As nearer to the lists they ride, The meikle menzie on ilk side Did break in twa, and clean divide, To gie them passage in; Whan baith had ridden up the gap, Again the crowd, like water-jaup, Thegither rush'd, and clos'd the slap Wi' hussiling and din: But whan the Papists, rang'd in raw, Their chief within the barriers saw, His courser bardit trig and braw Wi' gowd and crimson-claith; His ten-fit tram of aiken spear Terriblie wallopin' in air, Enouch e'en wi' its wind to scare A Lutheran to the death; They couldna bide that sicht without Clappin' their hands wi' pridefu' shout, And yellochin a' round about, As if the triumph's meed Were theirs already butten doubt: But soon frae Luther's gleesome rout Contrair there cam' a rattlin'-bout, A counter-clap indeed, That swallow'd up the Papist din, And shook the Paip's strang-hauld o' sin, Garrin' Sir Freir growe in his skin Wi' ane prophetic dreid. Ane herald bare upon his head (Like to a baxter bearin' bread) The cedar kist, a precious lade, O' mickle werth and wecht; Whairin the banes that host had cleikit, Though yellow-reestit sair and smeekit, Again were closit in and steekit, The premium o' that fecht: Sir Constable arrang'd in order Ilk thing within the barrier's border; Firm on their weir-steeds for the faucht, Ilk man fornent the tither straucht, Sat meditatin' deeds o' maucht: Good luck, their helmets hid their chouks, Whilk grinn'd and glowr'd sic crabbit looks, Sic terrible and grim rebukes, That, had they but seen ane anither, Baith knichts had likely swarf'd thegither, And drappit down wi' perfect drither. Within their rests their trams o' wood Stood tremblin', as if slauchter-wode, Bernin' up i' the air for blood: At last, as sign o' battle's breessil, Ane trumpeter garr'd reird and reissil His dainty, muckle-mou'd, brass-whistle, And cry't, “Sanct Andrew shaw the recht! Now, aff, ye deevils, to the fecht!” And at it, swap! baith horse and man, Windflaucht thegither rasch'd and ran: As whan twa fiery dragons dart In heevin' ilk ane frae diff'rent airt, And dash their hissin' heads thegither, As if t' upgabble ane anither; Heav'n rattles wi' the dunnerin' dush, And round is fill'd wi' fiery frush; The scouther'd Ram in terrour shakes Frae's smeekin' fleece the bernin' flakes; The Great Bear gowls; the Lesser quakes: Sae clos'd wi' bustyious bang and baff, Clerk Diston and Freir Tullidaff: And sae, as arms on arms were batter'd, The spunks, and sparks, and splinters blatter'd, And the hail barreis clash'd and clatter'd; The sky sough'd wi' ane eerie bum, And th' earnest people, all and some, Sat tremblin', doitrify'd, and dumb, To see what awfu' end mith come: But sae it happen'd that nae scaith That renk, wrocht either dool or death; They were sae cas'd in weirlike graith, Scart-free and haill they 'scapit baith: Yet did their spears sic straiks let gird, They near down-devel'd to the yird The dinnel'd warriours wi' their dird: Ilk fallow's heels clean gat the upper, His back-neck down upon the crupper: Yet soon again their heads up-bangit, Their steeds were turn't, and forwart spangit, Their bridles rang, and armour clangit: They clos'd; they clash'd; but, de'il-ma-care, Fient haet o' dammishment was there, Exceptin' that the not'ry's spear, As good luck did direck it, Did pierce the Papist's frock o' mail, And brak a big wanrestfu' beal, That near his lunzie, live and hail, Grew up aneath his jacket; For monie a year that boil had thriven, And monie a twinge its master given, Untill at length, throu' cuirass riven, In ran the airn by chance, And lat out baith the wind and matter, That lang had lodgit in that tetter; My certie! mair the man was better Of war's than surgeon's lance! He felt at ance his eased smart, And thank't his faeman in his heart For cure o' that mal-easy part, And hummit, Praise be blest! Then, musterin' micht for thwack and thump, He cry't, “Have at you, Lollard rump! For curin' me o' my sair lump, That lang has been my pest.” Incontinent wi' fire-slacht speed, They join'd, they grapplit steed to steed; Baith spears, as feckless for the fede, They drappit hither-thither; Wi' hands and arms alane they foucht: They grippit, graspit, warslet, wrocht, And, with enormous raxes, soucht T' unsaddle ane anither; As weel they mith hae try'd to stir up A rootit aik-tree, or a fir up, As aff frae saddle, out frae stirrup, T' up-heize the tane the tither; Sometimes they twinet breast and back Sae close, they for a minute stack; Sometimes, down headlang wi' a crack, Baith totterin' knichts were like to swak Upon the yird thegither; What might hae happ'd, nae man can say; They mith hae warstled on a' day, Had not ane goddess till the fray Down frae the sky come linkin', And cast her cantrip owr her knicht; (Some said they saw the vision bricht Down slidin' on a beam o' licht, And owr the barreis blinkin':) Her gramowrie she cast; and, swith! Her weary knicht's ilk limb and lith Gat tenfauld poustie, powr, and pith, To give his fae a jee-up; He gripp't the grey-freir by the waist, And, wi' a rousing rax, that maist Had haurl'd an aiken-tree up, He frae his saddle heiz'd him hie, And held him in his hand a wie Mair easy than a bairn in glee Haulds simmer butterflie up: Than, wi' a dardum and a dirdum, Yirdlins he daddit him and birr'd him: But what befel him thus-gate daddit, In the neist sang ye'll find it addit:— My Muse is jankit now and jadit! END OF SANG FOURTH. SANG FIFTH. ARGUMENT. Heils-over-head Sir Freir is cast, Whilk Papists' wreth does raise; But hameward soon they scamper fast, In terribill amaze: Their gates are then assail'd at last, Wi' fludes o' faemin' faes; A ghaist is seen; and omens ghast Betaken comin' waes. Their steeds, amid that battle's bustle, Camstarie turnin' wi' the justle, Back-spangit baith at anes, Near whair the herald on his head (Like to a baxter bearin' bread) The barrow bare wi' a' its lade O' cedar-kist and banes: And sae it fell, and sae it happit, That, as Sir Freir was erthlins swappit, Richt down upon the kist he drappit: As whan a tumbler at a fair, Whair thousands round him goave and stare, Up-wreils and whummles i' the air, Heels-over-gowdie whurlin'; Till, a' his birr exhaust, the man, Mair dizzy than he first began, Down frae the sky as fast's he can Comes whazelin' and hurlin'; Richt sae the freir i' th' ether whummlet, In super-sault, than erthlins tummlet: Swap on the barrow down he rummlet; The herald wi' the daud was hummlet; Nae wicht that wecht could bide; Fertor in flinders flew around; The kist, it boundit on the ground, Scatterin', throu' a' the barrei's bound, The banes frae side to side: Whilk, whan the vexit Papists saw, That shame they couldna stand at a', To see their knicht in the dead-thraw, And their belovit banes, That us'd to shine in shrinin'-box, Now dash't and casten at the cocks, Amang the sand and stanes: They couldna thole ae moment langer; They over-loup't the lists in anger, And dash't them down wi' clash and clanger; And down intill the course, Wi' hirdie-girdie hurly-burly, And countenances sour and surly, They drang wi' pith and force; As when at Dort or Zuyder-see, Whan wastern winds gowl dreidfullie, A sea-dyke, under stress o' sea, Is bursten by its blatter; Great swallin' surges frae the deep Come swingin' in wi' frichtsome sweep, To drown hail cities in their sleep, And to the weathercocks, to steep The steeples in salt-water: E'en sae the flude o' Papists brak The pales, and pour'd, wi' crash and crack, On the rink-room their creishy pack Wi' clamour and uproar, Up frae the grund their knicht to tak (That lay bumbazet on his back,) And cleik the heukle-banies black That sparpled lay about like wrack Or tangles on a shore: They scarce had time, 'mang sand and stanes, To glaum and glammach for the banes, Whan frae th' opposin' side at anes Down-lap douce Luther's thrang, Makin' the rails to flee asunder, And rollin' in wi' sound o' thunder T' attack in monie a score and hunder That break-faith Papish gang: As when i' th' Pentland firth twa tides, Owr wham a diff'rent tempest rides, (This ane the wast-wind lamps and lashes, That ane the east-wind drives and dashes Baith in to Stroma's strand,) They meet and curl their heads in wreth; Cauld Stroma's isle is fill'd wi' fraeth; The skipper caucht sees nocht but death, And wrack on ilka hand; But frae his wee house, Johnie Groat Keeks out, and blesses his glad lot That he's in bigget land: E'en wi' sic wreth commix and mingle Upon the crowdit rink-room's chingle, Papists and faes in dreidfu' pingle: Sir Tullidaff, that lay down-knocket, Was maistlins smother't up, and chokit, Wi' heaps that owr him flew and flockit; The weir-steeds round and round were blokit; Nae man thocht now on banes or kist; Heukbanes and shrine were now nae miss't; Their sauls were sae in ire: Ae Lollard-man got ere he wist A lounder frae a Papish fist, That garr'd his een glent fire; Ae Papish wratch gat on his pechan Sae devilish a dandiefechan, It dang clean in his stammach; Ae wee short canon, fat and fodgel, Gat on his bare pow wi' a cudgel, It garr'd him yesk his drammach: Was naething gain but knocks and nevels, And clamehewits, baffs, and bevels; The hail ring focht like vera devils; Neifs flew, like shot impell't by powther, Mortallie fast frae ilka showther; At shaven-crowns some fechtars slappit; On bany skulls hard knuckles rappit; At cheeks and noses ithers swappit, Sae that the dreidfu' blude down drappit; And some fell'd ane, some smash't anither; They baff't, buff't, cuff't, the tane the tither; Was never sic hillie-belew and flither Within a' Christendie thegither: Heav'n hielde us a' frae sic a drither! Dan Momus, frae his cloudie chair, Whair he was sittin' i' th' air, Observin', butten cark or care, This rumpus and this rook, Unseen, cam fleein' frae his heicht, And 'mang the fechtars down did licht: That mament he to human sicht Pat on ane human buik; He borrow't John Arbuckle's face, His belly, too, o' richt guid case, His sonsy over-lardit thies, His coots, his elbucks, and his knees, His gown and ither gear; The vera buttons, claith and steeks, Were just the same as Johnie's breeks; The hairs upon his chafts and cheeks Fient ane were less or mair; Tak the hail widdle a' thegither, Nae things were liker ane anither, Than this puir shadow, slim and bruckle, To solid-backit John Arbuckle, O' double chin and belly muckle: Amid the fecht he plumpit richt, Yet not ae body saw him licht; The carls, atween the wham he squeez'd, Felt na, as down his frame he feez'd; Nae sooner in but seen; behauld! His head, as if wi' cudgel maul'd, Show'd on its tapmast crown a bump A bonny weel-dissemblet lump, As if just risen frae the thump: A streap o' blude that rill'd as red As ony man's blude ever shed Strinkel't his ilka haffet; The swallin' seem'd as gin it had That mament got a dainty dad, And that the rung that gae the blad Was just up-liftit aff it: Whairat th' Eidolon wi' the pain Yelloch't wi' a' his micht and main: A thousand nowt in Falkland plain, Gather'd for sale to southron-men, Upon a market-day, E'en were they a' at anes to rout, Couldna hae bellow't sic a bout, As that fause freir, perfay; Not Mars, whan he at Troy was woundit, Sae terrible a scroinogh soundit, Whan the hail Hellespont reboundit, And ky on Ida's taps confoundit Ran down the hills for fray: Was never heard sae fell a shout In Fife, and a' the land about; The sky kept half a minute dirlin'; Sclates cam aff roofs o' houses hurlin'; A man, up at the Milton-dam, Swaif't, and fell down intill a dwam; He lay an hour ere back he cam! As whan a bairn a ba' doth fling, In a round-heapit barley-bing, Some day in funnie glee; The pickles, whair the ba' doth licht, Are dashit round about on flicht, And up the barn fly out o' sicht E'en to the riggen-tree: Sae-wyse the Papists, as befel That terrible warld-waukin' yell, Did scatter aff, and skail pell-mell, As fast as they could flee: The freir they ne'er look't i' the face; They took nae time to speir his case; The nearest to him first up-banget; They thocht themsels baith shot and hanget; The farrest aff, as much fear-fangit, Like run-de'ils boltit aff and spangit: Nae wicht had pow'r to ask his brither, De'il, man, what means this flicht and flither? But drivin', daddin' ane anither, As fast as legs could loup, In bangs successive aff they shoalit, And east the Scores in surges rollit, Mair as they mair had skoup; Terrour flew owr them wi' his whip, And scourg'd their pows as they did skip; He leisch'd the blude out o' their faces, Sendin' it down to ither places, That of it mair had need; Feet flew and flicker'd derf and dire; Knee-pans and knees amaist took fire Wi' spankin' and wi' speed: They'd need o' speed; for, at their back, Wi' hoot and whoop and lachter's crack, Their faemen, Learnin's gleesome pack, Triumphantlie did rattle, Kickin' the blindin' stour on hie, And hurlin' sticks and bits o' tree, And knockin' wi' baith leg and knee Upon the fatlings aff that flee Mair fast than frae a battle; The Fisher-Knicht, wi' halbert's prob, Their hobblin' hender-ends did job, As on they wallop and they bob Afore him wi' a brattle; The rink-space soon was toom'd o' men; Baith tane and tither aff were gane; Dickeman's-wynd again was chokit; The Butts wi' bodies up was blockit; The Castle-wynd in screighs out-bokit Thick, thick, on Greg'ry's green Monks, canons, freirs, that thither flockit To save themsels and cowl and rocket, Within the yetts, that stood unlockit To catch the skails, that maul'd and mockit, Cam rushin' in bedien; The yetts resoundit wi' their shout; For ane that gat in o' that rout, Ten fuffin' stood a while thairout: As keps a lang ae-archit brig A blashy spate o' waters big Whan Lammas rains fa' fast; Aboon the brig the fludes stand heapit; Below they're rather laigh and neapit, Though down they guller fast: Sae a' without, wi' folks was floodit, But a' within, was nae sa crowdit; Till by and bye in time, As ae fat bang dang in anither, The yets, that gap't t' admit that fither, Swallow'd the haill o' them thegither, Baith shaven-crown and waim. Whilst at the yetts gaed on this steir Upon the renk the warden-freir, Forleitet by his Papish feir, Lay doitrify't and doytet; His saul, frae whan it swarf'd awa, Dumfounder't wi' the daddin' fa' Had never hame return't at a', Syn on his back he cloytit: He restit canny at his ease; Whan owr him faes ran chasin' faes, He kent na o' their clutter; Else had he felt the smaiks that time March owr the mountain o' his wyme, He'd nicket them for that sam crime, And briz'd their bodies into slime, As ane would brize fresh-butter: Aside him stood his steed o' weir, That owr him nicker'd strang and clear, Strivin' to rouse his master dear:— As he in dwalmin'-fit lay there, Behauld! king Bacchus in the air Descry'd his drearie dools, And cry'd, Allace me and alack! That thus my knicht sould lie in wrack Sae lang, owr-whelmit on his back, Reckless o' hippocras or sack, Like corp meet for the mools: He mauna die on that cauld field; His weird is no the ghaist to yield 'Mang stanes and dirt sae sunken; But canopy'd by dreepin' table, Whan's back-bane is to sit unable, To yesk his saul awa' in glore Upo' the death-bed o' the floor, For-wakit and for-drunken; Meantime, to help him frae his dwam, He wad be nae waur o' a dram: So down he flew, and, as he flew, His radiant shape he did transmew Into a Tavernar most truc, Just girt for operation; His bloizent face, begildet fine Wi' rubicunditie divine, Spak volumes in the praise o' wine, Wi' obvious celebration; Ane apron cinctured his waist, Whairtill a gowden cork-screw lac'd Divulg'd his occupation; His richt-hand grippit firm and fast A brandy-bottle, big and vast As onie in this nation; His left the glitterin' glass did grip, Whairfrae his bumbaz'd knicht mith sip Tebbit and animation: So down he lichtet at his side, And frae the bottle o' his pride He jirbles out a dram, And lifts it to the grey-freir's neis; To the freir's harns the fragrance flees; That mament back he cam! He gript it like a man delierit; He tootit aff the glorious spirit; He drownit dead his dwam! “Anither tass,” he cries, “and than”— He gat it frae the tapster-man; Nae mair about it; up he sprang Upon his weir-steed wi' a bang, Mair ferdie, and mair swank and strang Than when a-field he drew; His steed he punzied wi' his heel, And east the Scores as mad's the de'il, Makin' the chuckie-stanes to reel, He gallopit and flew; Three minutes' time was scantlins past, Whan Luther's people stood aghast Within the yett, to view Baith founder't Tullidaff and horse, Wham they had left upon the course, Postet and set in tenfauld force, The tuilzie to renew, And frae the stranghaulds to rambarre The shock o' that near-comin' war: “Come on, ye dowfarts! ilka ane; Fecht me wi' swerd, or stick, or stane; Come on, I will recule for nane!” Quo' the bauld laird o' Innergellie To gley-mou'd Sipsie,—“My dear billie! Saw you not late yon flastin fellie, Wi's circumbendibus o' bellie, Spread flatlins on the yird?” Quo' gley-mou'd Sipsie,—“By Sanct Geil! I now believe in gramarie weel; And that yon dampnit Papish chiel Is friendit by man's fae the de'il, That he so soon hath stirr'd!” Quo' wise Stravithie,—“I na thocht That pray'rs to saints or demons broucht Help till ane founder't man in oucht, Till now that I behauld Yon bannock-hive set up again, Thro' help o' Satan or Sanct Blane, To daur and challenge us, ilk ane, Sae boysterous and bauld.” Thusgates the lairds did tove and crack As that fierce freir, on courser's back, Did barricad the Pends; Whilst i' th' Cathedral-yett John Annan, The dean o' puissant pith, was stannin', And, like a dainty bombard-cannon, That ither port defends. By this time Greg'ry's-green was pang Wi' multitudes that, thick and thrang, Frae ilk inlett ran in ding-dang: And the South-street, frae th' Eastburn-wynd Down to the Pends, was pav'd and lin'd Wi' pows o' bodies a' kinkind: Sanct Androis town, though wonder-auld, Did never in her day behauld A gadderin' sae big and bauld: Not e'en that glad mid-simmertide, Whan the great Kirk was sacrify'd; What day our guid king Robert Bruce, Wi' a' his feir o' courtiers crouse, Abbots and deans, and bishops douce, Drest in their dalmatykes sae spruce, Their rings and ither braws; Wi' the haill pick and wale o' Fife, Gentle and sempill, man and wife, Frae town and hamlet, swarmin' rife, Appear'd within the wa's; Grund-flure and gall'rie, nave and wing, Seem'd but ane universal bing; Yet, though the kirk inside was thrang, Without there was a michtier bang; Windocks and doors were cramm't and heapit Wi' wichts that glowrit in and gapit; The roofs, ilk spire, the great mid-steeple Were buzzin', and owr-clad wi' people: And whan they skail'd, that michtie flock, (I've read it in ane auncient boke,) The kirk-yard's coffins yald and broke Aneath the press o' livin' fock! That was a day for folk nae doubt, But this day that I speak about Was famouser for rabble-rout: Like swallin' jaws on rough shores jappin', Loud, loud their tongues, withouten stappin', Gaed on thegither, reirdin', rappin': Rich were their mou's o' gibe and jaip, And fulmination 'gainst the Paip; Sedition set ilk gab a-gape: Dowr were their threats and their grimaces, Gurlie and crabbit-like their faces, As glunsch'd they at the Papish places, Bannin' within their hearts and sauls The vera stanes intill the walls. And now, respondent to their minds, Their hands wagg'd wapons a' kinkinds; And sic varietie o' graith, Gather't for sailzie and for skaith, And wieldit by sae wud a band, Was never seen in onie land; Cauld airn was now distinctly seen In sindry shapes baith blunt and keen; Timmer in baston, cudgel, rung, Owr-head was swappit now and swung; And stanes were bicker't aff and flung. Chiefly upon the champions twa, Stanc'd ilka ane to guard his wa', The tempest o' the weir did fa'; Great cuddy-rungs and gnarlet cuds, Wi' soundin' harness-thumpin' thuds, Cam' peltin' on their backs in cluds; The causey-stanes were fierce up-rippet, And in strang neifs be-grasp't and grippet, And burl'd wi' vengeance and wi' rippat: Stanes, sticks, and bricks, as thick as shot, Rain'd aff ilk hero's iron coat, And at his feet did rap and stot; As when upon a Christmas cloud King Johnie Frost doth ride abroad, And frae his wallet flings Owr a great city's houses' taps His hail in mickle rattlin' draps, That aff the eaves upo' the street Come stottin' at the burghers' feet, And settle there in bings; Sae stanes, stobs, sticks, come peltin' aff Dean Annan and freir Tullidaff: But nae the less, for a' that stour, They stand immoveable and dowr, And naething reck that 'saultin' shower. But whan bauld Innergellie saw How thir twa bangsters foil'd them a', And row'd the surge o' weir awa' Aff frae the Papish houffs, His lip wi' wreth wox big and red, And to the fisher-knicht he said, “Ah! shame on mine and on your head! Twa caitiff cowart couffs! That here behauld, but care or cark, Yon fat-envelop't chieftains stark, Twa blaitie-bums in iron sark, Withstandin' a' our feir; While we, wham for our rigs and lands Weil it becomes to use our brands, And shaw ensample to the bands, Stand taiglin', daiglin' wi' our hands, And whillie-whain' here: Ah! ill we do deserve to dine, And gust our gabs wi' dribs o' wine, If we, to th' eyes o' lawly hine, Eschew the feats and wark divine O' hardiness and weir; Gang you then, and wi' fearsome dunt Attack Sir Tullidaff in front, Whilst I the kirk-yard-dyke shall mount, And sailzie wi' impetuous brunt Dean Annan in his rear: And never may we tout again A tass o' claret or champagne, But sit dry-mou'd wi' drinkin' men, If we do not wi' micht and main Dumfounder dean and freir.” Sae speakin', wi' a machtie spang Up on the kirkyard-dyke he sprang; Atap o' the wa' he stood nat lang, But down intill the inside flang Himsel' wi' awsome beir: His armour, as he fell, did clank; His feet amang the grass-graves sank; He fand himsel', baith front and flank, Ere well he wist, wi' Papists' rank Surroundit far and near; Round him they rush't, and push't, and pecht, To overturn him wi' their swecht, Or wi' their bellies' waddlin' wecht, Ere he was well awere, To gruss him down intill a graff, Withouten kist or bier; He at their waddlin' troop did lauff, And wi' his prickin' gude pyk-staff Made them rebound and wintle aff, To shelter them frae buff and baff Within the kirk and queir. Dean Annan a' this time was thrang Rebuttin' his confrontin' gang, And keppin' on his cuirass strang The stanes that on him dush't and dang; Ah! little did he think, That in his rear a warlike man Was meditatin' wicket plan, And comin' up as fast's he can To gie his back a clink! The craftie laird did soon draw near, And, hidlins hoverin' in his rear, Wi' searchin' een, like pawky scout, Explor'd his rearward round-about, To find some part defenceless out Whairthro' to prick and punzie; He soon discern't, wi' gleesome heart, Ane out-post, ane unguarded pairt, That seem'd to court cauld iron's smart, Stretchin' itsel' for straik o' dart, Frae neck-bane down to lunzie; “Sanct Clune,” he said, “direck my dird, And bring this fallow to the yird!” That mament he a straik let gird That throu' the faeman's breeches birr'd, And in his breech did settle; The man, bumbazit at the smart, Cast round his richt hand to the part, And fand intrench'd the dulefu' dart, That sent a prinklin' to his heart Mair fierce than burr or nettle: His heart, bein' dirlet to the quick, Gaes whiltie-whaltie, fast and thick, Wi' quiverings and quakes; His een, bein' in the mirligoes, Ae single styme afore his nose They couldna see for glaiks: Sae down he tummlet in a drow, And owr-and-owr did wreil and row; His frichtit ghaist, un-housit now, A while his flesh forsakes;— Strange! that ae punzie on the back Should sooner bring that carl to wrack Than sticks and cudgels, monie a hunder, Hurl'd at him wi' a hideous lounder, And peltin' on his front like thunder: Sic droll bout-gates, sic sma' mean means, Bryng michty kings, and dukes and thanes Aft to their laighest marrow-banes! As he lay wamblin', dead amaist, Forleitit by his ain dear ghaist, Behauld! the faemen wham he fac'd, And frae the yett aff-fendit, Seein' its buirdly bulwerk gane, Grew galyard now, and crouse ilk ane, And throu' the yett wi' micht and main Merrilie spang'd and stendit. There let them spang and stend a wee Till we look round about and see How Tullidaff is comin' on Wi' th' Fisher-knicht and ither fone. The Fisher-knicht, whan that he saw His brither laird owr-loup the wa', And, Alexander-like, furth-shaw Example in that strife, Now thocht it guid time to begin To shaw (his saul bein' in that pin) He car'd as little for his skin As onie man in Fife; He saw how Tullidaff the proud Sat on his weir-steed vap'rin' loud, Obstructin' in his pridefu' mood The Pends to all and each, Cryin',—“Ye dowfarts! ilka ane, Ha! fecht me now wi' swerd or stane! Come on, I will recule for nane!” And sic like flastin' speech; Whilk raisit till ane unco heicht The crabbitness o' that guid knicht, To see himsel and a' his micht Sae mockit and sae put to sleicht By sic a bladderand freir: Instant he frae his henchman's hand, That near him did perfurnish'd stand Wi' a' his battle-gear, Grippit and grasp't wi' michtie strength A pow-axe of enormous length, Whase vera sicht strack fear; Its airn, curv'd like a three-nichts' moon, Heich quivered his head aboon A dozen fit and mair; The folk that stood about the knicht Flew back wi' driddour and wi' fricht, As they beheld the monstrous sicht Rise owr them in the air; Its vera sough did freeze their bluid, And on their scalps, that birsy stood, Garr'd prinkle ilka hair: Wi' baith his arms up i' the sky, Typhœus-like, he held it high, And, thro' the press advancin' nigh To that big braggart there, He brocht it down wi' siccan force Upon the forehead o' his horse, A thunderbolt wi' fudder-flash Couldna hae gien sae fell a smash, Or made sae loud a rair; The weir-steed's skull was yerk'd in twa; Ae half flew to the wastern wa'; The tither half, baith bluid and bane, Was daddit to the eastern ane, And stack upon ane ayslar stane: Sae swift and swipper was the deed, That for a little while the steed Withouten either harns or heid Stood, after he was slain, Immoveable in that same stede, Ere he perceiv'd that he was dead, Or that his head was gane: But by-and-bye, on side and back He devell'd wi' a deadly swack; Sir Tullidaff, amid the wrack, Down to the grund came tumblin', Wi' a' his cumbrous battle-graith, His wecht o' flesche and armour baith, About him rattlin', rumblin'; The monie-archit pends a' round Wi' clang and bang did ring and sound, As down he dunner'd on the ground; But it sae chanced that his horse (Whilk now was but ane headless corse) Had drappit on his schank and thie, And briz'd them sair and heavilie, Wi' mickle pyne and stress, Sae that th' o'erwhelmit freir in vain Wrigglet and warslet fast and fain To get his shank-bane eas'd again Frae sic a sair distress; And skelloch'd at ane awfu' rate, As onie man in sic a state Would do to get redress: His faes they did na care a dout For a' that he did yell and yout, But owr him wi' a boastfu' shout They ran wi' fitterin' feet; In ae half-minute frae his fa', The pends were cramm't frae wa' to wa', As in they bangit, great and sma', Outrageous fram the street; The portals o' the houffs o' sin Were now wide ope to let them in, And shouts without and screams within Proclaimit round about That now was come the weird-fix't hour Ordain'd to break the Papish power, And frae her lust-engend'rin' bower To haurl the Harlot out: That hour, it's said, the mickle bell In the great steeple, o' itsel', Did toll a heavie dismal knell, As harbinger t' announce and tell The waes that did owr-hing: And Arnold's nakit ghaist was seen (They said, that saw it wi' their een,) Loupin' hip-hop frae spire to spire, And skiftin' owr the roofs like fire, Like ane unsettlet thing; And aye he blubber't and he blobbit, And, Fare ye rveil! aye sich't and sobbit, And sair his hands did wring; Than south to France he turn'd his ee, And loupit clean out-owr the sea Wi' ane amazin' spring: And, frae the marble that did pave The mools o' Lamberton's cauld grave, Big bluidy draps, wi' elritch grane, As if the man below did mane, Barst out and smotter't a' the stane: Ilk buried bishop seem'd to howl, Ilk image did respond and yowl, Ilk gallerie sent out a gowl, And the great altar gave a growl! Sic awfu' signs, that awfu' hour, Portendit the approachin' stowre, The rushin' down o' kirk and towr, And downfa' o' the Papish power! END OF SANG FIFTH. SANG SAXT. ARGUMENT. This canticle's the best ava; There's fechtin' and there's thwackin'; Canons and freirs frae kirk and ha' Are peltit and sent packin'; Pu'pits and beelds are hackit sma'; There's guttin' kists and hackin'; And as the finish, to crown a', Down comes the steeple crackin'. The sun was cockin' now upon The vera pin o' Mid-day's cone, And frae his beryl-bernin' throne, That loftily did low, Scatter't his great spring-flude o' beams, That whiten'd a' th' Eastnook wi' gleams, And made the Firth's clear glassy streams In siller dance and row; Nae cloud owr-head the lift did dim, But i' the wastern weddir-glim A black up-castin', with ane rim O' darkness, lace'd the yerth, Betakenin' by the vapour's form, That in th' Atlantic flude a storm Was lab'rin' for a birth. The hour o' denner now was come, And men grew hungry all and some, And cravin' in their crap; Frae five o'clock that they had risen Sorry a flow had cross't their gizen O' solid or o' sap; In Lothian, and in ither pairts, They denner'd weil, wi' cheirfu' hearts, On tailyies fat and fine; But in Sanct Androis town that day, Man, wife, nor bairn, as I've heard say, Had na' a heart to dine; They were sae bent on cloister-guttin', And hackin' images and cuttin', Ae thocht on beef or yet on mutton Nae man could safely spare; He that was yesterday a glutton, This day he didna care a button For belly or for fare: Hunger and Anger are near-kin, Whilk made them that bauld wark begin Wi' greater dirdom, wraith, and din, Than they wud dune wi' panget skin Plumpet wi' vivers rare. Sae in within the yetts they ran Ramstam, rampagin', wife and man, Thousands, wi' bitter winze and ban, Cast at the rotten bang, That now, confoundit wi' the steir, Took to their heels in deidly fear, To shelter them in kirk or queir Frae that in-pourin' thrang; Canon, and greasy monk, and prior, Arch-dean, and ilka-colour'd freir, The Pape's hail fam'ly, fat and fere, Did in a mass forgather Within their sacrify'd abodes, Scougin' themsel's frae stanes and clods, Aside their shrines and velvet-cods, Their Lares and their household-gods, Frae siccan stalwart weather; As Trojan wives, upon that nicht Whan Priam's palace bleezit bricht, Huggit and kiss't (a doolfu' sicht!) Altars and posts in ghastlie fricht, Makin' loud scriechs and manes; Saewise that cowl'd and girdlet fither, Astoundit wi' dumfounderin' drither, Ran throu' the Hey-kirk hither-thither, Huggin' their beilds and banes: The doors were steek'd and boltit hard; Wickets and windocks firmly barr'd; But throu' the doors and wa's they heard, Ascendin' from without, The terrible stramash o' tongues, And winzes flung fram angry lungs, And shouts o' men wi' picks and rungs, That huddlit round about; Ilk man encouragin' his feer, Cryin' aloud, To weir! to weir! Down wi' the Harlot and her geir! Assailzie! Strike! Destroy! Whilst throu' the windocks they did spy Weir's wild wud wappens wavin' by; Cuds, swerds, and halberts, heavit high, Whase shadows 'tween them and the sky Forebodit noucht but noy; And surly faces, warst ava, Horribly glumschin' ane and a', Or girnin' into joy, As they look't up ilk lofty wa', Takin' their meiths for its downfa', That they may strike and stroy. Thairat th' assailzie did begin Wi' gallyies o' loud-blairin' din; A thousand sticks, a thousand stanes, Are throu' the windocks dash't at anes; The garnish't glass, the birnish't lozens, Are knocket in, and dash't in dozens; Great iron-sweys, great timmer-trams, And meikle smitin' batterin'-rams, Swinget about by angry squads, Gaif ilk besiegit door sic dads, They garr'd them crack and flee in blads; Man, wife, nor bairn, of a' that host, Was idle, or was aff his post; The little bairns threw little stanes, And play'd upon the paintet panes; The wives, as rampant in their mettle, With idle foolitch neifs did ettle, And wi' their flytings fir'd the battle: The men—here sax, there seven or aucht, A batterin'-ram wi' a' their maucht, Were swappin' 'gainst a portal straucht; Here scores their pinches and their picks Atween the ayslar stanes did fix, And rugg't and rave them out; Wi' batter-ax some brak in sma' The carvit wark and pillars bra, Sendin' the glory of the wa', In fritter't frush about; Some to the windocks up did clamber, And daddit in, wi' chappin'-hammer, The staney-frames and lead; Some delvit down wi' spades and shools, Deep, deep amid the yerth and mools, Strivin' wi' howkin' and wi' diggin' To bring th' upsettin' pridefu' biggin' Laigh down amang the dead: And some gat ladders large and lang, On whilk they mountit and did spang, Chasin' ilk ither in a bang Up to the roofs on hie; Owr whilk frae end to end they spread, Like flock o' locusts black and braid, And rave frae rafter and frae riggin' The capper that owr-clad the biggin', Glitterand owr land and sea. But, saftly, Muse! and tak mair time; Be mair partic'lar in your rhime; I wish to ken what chiftain first Intill th' expugnate kirk did burst? What man assailzied with ane kick The water-vat, and garr'd it quick Gang rowin' aff its silver styk? Wha the Hey-altar over-coupit? The graven idols aff wha soupit? Wha tumbled down the Card'nal's pupit? And monie ither famous thing, Worthy o' you to say and sing, Albeit I be to write inding. The batterin'-ram wi' jowin' jerk Nae sooner brak the door o' th' kirk, Whan Caryl's bauld through-gain' clerk Burst in wi' sudden spang, His left hand holdin' up on-heicht The borough-colours wavin' bricht; A halbert in his stalwart richt Up-stannin' clean and lang; He paus'd a wee on the dure-stane, Crying, “Hurra! my merry men! Ha! Satan's toy-shop now is taen! Look up and see your spulzie! March, birkies, ben, and follow me!” Sae sayin', wi' triumphant glee, He wav't his pennon up on hie, The sign o' march and tulzie; Whilk whan the Papish folk beheld, A gallyie o' fierce wraith was yell'd Frae a' within the kirk, Mixt wi' shrill skellochs o' despair As they espy'd gambadin' there That lion-lookin' clerk: Yet, nat the less for his bauld look, Great shoals o' freirs, frae ilk kirk-neuk, Men o' weil-biggit frame and buik, Cam down upon him ruschin', Ettlin', wi' fuffin' and wi' pain, To ding th' assaulter back again, And hurlin' at his head a rain O' creepie, stool, and cushion: He lower'd down his braid-cheek't wappen, And round and round he held it swappin', To catch the fallows that mith happen To come within his cleik; Will Cranstoun, that deil's-buckie chap, (A tap-thrawn monk wi' roundit cap,) Was the first man that caught a wap; He gat in on his cheek; Wi' its strang swing, the girdlet brither Flew frae ae pillar to the tither, Syn in a stound did drap: Tam Guillaum in his heavy gown (A bummill kent throu' a' the town) Was the neist man whase shaven crown Was hansel'd wi' a swap; The bummil felt the swap sae sair, Backlins he stagger't wi' a rair To Gamyl's tomb, and hid him thair Fram onie mair wanhap; And twenty mair sic rotten whelps Gat on the haffets famous skelps, That made them utter yells and yelps And tummle into trances; Sae that the not'ry throu' the wrack O' strewit shavelings in a crack March't wi' his legion at his back With iron-gads and lances; By this time, too, wi' dreidfu' din, The windocks a' were driven in, And heaps o' ragin' bodies Cam streamin' in throu' ilk fenester, Loupin' ilk man than tither faster, Red-wud for mischief and disaster, And brandishin' their cuddies; Sae that the kirk's ilk batter'd side Fram a' her raggit loop-holes wide, Lat in ane over-flowin' tide O ragin'-wud assaulters; That forcit into sma'er space The Paip's canallyie scant o' grace, Garrin' them fecht i' th' middle place For heartstanes now and altars: And now the hail kirk east and wast Was but ane hurlie-burlie vast O' fechtars and defenders fast A' toylin' at the tulyie; The Cross-kirk too was just as thrang O' bangsters that did ither 'mang In hideous tulyie-mulyie; Terrible thumps were gien and taken, Whairby ten thousand ribs were shaken; Nae man did spare his faeman's bacon; Nae man cry'd, Hoolyie! Hoolyie! Braid showther-blades now gat their paikin'; Back-banes wi' bastinads were shaken Down, down to their foundation: Ilk wappen that cam frae the coast, Was now in action by the host, Swung round their huddlin' heads and tost In windy agitation; Battens and a' kinkind o' sticks, Clodmells and barrow-trams and picks, And handspakes that gave lounderin' licks, Flicker'd in fierce vibration; The vera wind o' siccan werk Blew down the mouse-webs black and mirk, That had, up on the tap o' th' kirk, Twa hunder year been stickin'; What wi' the mouse-webs fram on hie, And stour that frae their feet did flie, Around their heads a canopie O' mistie motes did thicken; Sae that, half-hidden in the dark, They labour'd at the fechtin'-wark, But ilka man took weil his mark, And, as he lounder't strang and stark, Kent weil wham he was lickin'. Around the bonnie siller-platter, That did contein the Heilie water, Twal canons bare the brunt and blatter By William Lauder backit, Whase face wi' crabbitness did grin, And his flyte-poke aneath his chin Priev'd he was in an angry pin To be thus-gate attacket; The laird o' Barns discern't ere lang That canker'd carl amid the gang, Wha wi' his accusation dang Gude Wishart to the dede; The mem'rie o' that wicket thing, And cruel martyrdom inding Was to his mind a ready sting, To prick him up to fede: Ah, cruel wratch! he thus began, Yet dost thou live, thou wicket man? Whan he wham thy black tongue did ban Lies down amang the dead! Ah! happy me, if I can pay Sma' vengeance for that michtie wae: He drew his swerd out, saying sae, And wi' a sturdy straik, First his richt ear he clean aff-cleft, And than he sneddit aff his left, Leavin' o' baith his lugs bereft The head of that vile rake: The wratch ran quiverin' aff and quakin', Leavin' his lugs to save his bacon; Happy it sae had endit, For had he gat his just desert, His tongue, the rogue's maist peccant pairt, Had frae his mou' been rendit: But whan Kilbrachmont by that taken The water-ewer saw forsaken, Nor langer weil defendit, He rush'd upon it with a spang, And wi' a monstrous kick down-dang The styk o' silver rich and lang That did up-hald the platter; The vat flew mair than twenty paces, Strenkellin', a' round, the fechtar's faces, Wi' its out-waffin' water; The stick, extirpate wi' the blaw, Clean owr the flure frae wa' to wa' Gaed rowin' wi' a clatter. Whilst styk and vat was dingin' down, A troop, saul-thirsty for renown, The scholars of Sanct Androis town, Ilk ane in dud o' scarlet gown, Gaed 'tween the wa's and pillars, Ravagin' on, a furious squade, The Regent Douglas at their head, Seekin' for beelds to ding them dead, That they mith spread their name abread As famous image-killers: Ilk tirlie-wirlie mawment bra, That had, for cent'ries ane or twa, Brankit on pillar or on wa', Cam tumblin' tap-owr-tail; The gifts o' Cardinals and Paips, Owr-fret wi' spanglet gowden-caps, And siller vest or veil, Aneath the straik o' learnit gown, Cam divin' on the pavement down, Ilk ane upon its marble crown Smashin' itsel' to splinders; A saint or image in a niche, That wont to glitter there sae rich, Enflamin' folk to sic a pitch— The sorrow ane was left o' such; The haill were frush'd to flinders: Much glory frae that plunder-bout Ilk learnit gown, withouten doubt, May challenge and may claim; Exceptin' Crail's bauld wabster-band, For idol-breakin' strength o' hand, Nane may the guerdon sae demand, Or share sae weil the fame. Meantime a fier o' lairds, close groupit, Besiegit weil the mickle pu'pit; It was the Cardinal's ain kirk-loom; He brocht it in a ship frae Rome; 'Twas a' owr-carv'd wi' saints and fairies, And tirlie-wirlies and fleegaries, And cardinals'-hats and Virgin Maries; Fram it he us'd, on gala-days, Busk't in his bravitie o' claes, To pitter-patter and to phrase: The vera sicht o' that vain loom Recallit Beaton up and Rome; The lairds wox wudder aye and wudder; They drew their swerds, and, in a pudder, Attack't it fierce as fire or fudder; They hack't it sae wi' swerd and dirk, Splenders and bits at ilka yerk Gaed fleein' round throu' a' the kirk; Never was sakeless dask o' timmer Sae persecute and put to cummer; What wi' their gulligaws and gashes, The pu'pit had been driv'n to smashes, And not ae scrap had 'scap'd that stour To busk the bein' ha' o' Balfour, The dining-room of Balfour-house is still decked with the beautiful remnants of this celebrated pulpit. Had not a laird cry'd, “Hoolie! hoolie! Hae mercy ilk man wi' his gullie! Leave but a crumb o' this kirk-loom, Memorial o' the power o' Rome, And my Lord Card'nal's bottom-room!” This said, they a' their showthers stoopit, And whummel'd up the muckle pu'pit. Thus they; but battle's fiercest beir Was ragin' the Hey-altar near; That was the crater o' the steir, The vera navel o' the weir; Lord Prior James had stood there lang, Rallyin' and gen'rallin' his gang; But seein' Papists' side gae wrang, Out at the Chanc'llor's-door he flang: A howdle o' hog-showtherin' freirs, Augustines, Carm'leits, Cordeliers, He bauldly left ahent, To be that altar's body-guard, And bide the buff o' lout and laird, As he flew owr the bent: Than skippers, tailzeours, lairds, and hinds, Fludes o' mad burghers a' kinkinds, Dissim'lar men, but sim'lar minds, In formidable sailyie, Cam' whurrin' in like cats on rattens, Swappin' their handspakes and their battens, And ither mad artailyie; Then mells cam' down on gowden pyx; Cud quarrell'd it wi' crucifix; And crosiers and candlesticks In th' air excambied furious licks Wi' aiken-rungs and chappin'-sticks: Was never sic a squabble! Hood, cord and round-cap, cowl and clout, In tatter-wallops flew about; Trodden were wafers under-foot; And than sic skellochin' and shout, Frae conquerin' and conquer'd rout! Was never sic a yabble! If e'er there was sic strife and clatter, Fracas o' tongues and bellerin' blatter, 'Twas at the towr o' Babel! The Cross-kirk rang wi' scolds and flytes; The Main-kirk rang wi' slaps and smites; Pell-mell, thwack! hiddie-giddie! There were sic gouffs, and youffs, and swaks, On heads and bellies, sides and backs, If onie whair are heard sic cracks, 'Tis in a blacksmith's smiddie! Not frae the blacksmith's study rush Sae thick the sparks and hammer-flush, As then did devel, dunt, and dusch, Makin' the ee-sicht giddie: Aiblins they'd focht till candle-licht, Had not a stieve braid-showther'd wicht, My great-great-grandsher, in his micht, Ran on them wi' a spang; Meal-melvied as he was, I wot, The meal cam fleein' aff his coat, As up the kirk he sprang; He caucht John Caldcleugh by the thrapple, And made him tirvie down and tapple Head-foremest wi' a bang: He clench't Tam Tottis (Johnie's brither), And garr'd him waigle hither-thither, Syn on the flure him flang: Arch-dean John Wynram he did grip; He caucht Prior Guthrie on the hip; He garr'd fat hoastin' Forman skip; Principal Cranston he did trip; He wi' his fingers' furious nip Half-strangled Canon Strang: Great Ajax, whan he waxit daft, Bang'd na the puir sheep owr the taft, As my great-grandsher bang'd and baf't That rotten Papist gang: Sic doings were owr het to last; The Papists could na bide that blast; Astonay'd, gumple-fac'd, aghast, Out at the Dortour-door, fu' fast, Hurry-scurry, they birr'd and brast, Wi' blastin' and wi' puffin'; The Chanc'llor's dure was pang'd alsae; Ilk man, brain-mad to get away, Kickin' the neist to garr him gae, On's mooly-heel rapt horny tae; And out-ran, fisslin', fuffin': Meantime my grandsher and some others, The Laird o' Grange, and John Carruthers, In chevalrie twin-bairns and brothers, The altar fierce attacket; Missal and mawment, pyx and tass, The haill machinery o' the mass Were soupit down and swacket; The marble slabs, the gowden-gilt, The frettit-wark was stroy'd and spilt; That great show-shop of idol-ware, Gather't for near four hunderd year, Graham's, Gamyl's, Pai's, and Arnold's gear, Rome's michtie mummery heapit there— Was in a mament wracket! The kirk, meantime, was turnin' thinner O' vile mass-worshipper and sinner; They saw their Capitol now shaken, Their great Palladium tash'd and taken; Sae, out at ilk door, quiverin', quakin', They birringly did bicker; Men never, wi' sic whoslin' breath, Fram th' instantaneous grip o' death Flew furiouser or quicker: Doors wadna serve to let them gang; Furth at the windocks too they sprang; Terrible stends they took and lang, To 'scape frae that kirk-bicker; In kirkyard or in abbey-ground They tarry'd not ae single stound; They coudna think their heads their ain Ere they were fairly fled and gane: Sae out at ilka abbey-yett Baith south, and east, and wast, they sett Out-owr the kintra fast; Strathtyrum's bonnie banks were black Wi' freirs, aff-fleein' in a pack, Wi' tatterwallops at their back, And faces clean down-cast; Some took the road to Cupar-town; Some to the Anster coast ran down; Some bicker'd to Balmer'nie; some To Falkland, ere they stap't, did come; Some landit up at Tullilum Wi' stammachs clung and clappit; For therty miles a' round about, The land was cover't wi' that rout, That ran and never stappit; The roads and fields, as if wi' buds, Were strawn wi' rags and bits o' duds, That frae their showthers drappit; Sic wrack, and ruin, and deray, Was never in Scotland syn the day Whan scatter't Southrons in dismay Frae Bannockburn's eventfu' day Ran on and never stappit. As they were fleein' thus abread, Kirk-spulyie, herriement, and raid, Gaed on mair fast than ever; In the Main-kirk three thousand folk Carv't-wark and arch and pillar broke; Through the Cross-kirk twa thousand ran Batterin' awa', ilk angry man, Wi' hammer, axe, and lever; A thousand bodies on the riggin' Tirr'd and unroof't the pridefu' biggin'; Great faulds o' capper aff were flypit; Great sheets o' braid lead aff were rippit; The folk aboon in joy down-lookit Throu' holes that their ane hands had howkit, Hallooin' them below; The folk below cast up their een, Gazin' on sky and heevin's sheen, Throu' sky-lichts whair late nocht was seen But ceiling dark and rafter-treen,— And shoutit back, Hurro! Sae ilka man provok't his brither, And the hail tot gaed on thegither, Vyin' in strife wi' ane anither At ravagin' and ruggin'; Nae thing was prosperin' there and thrivin', But tirlin' roofs and rafter-rivin', And pullin' down and puggin'; Weil as they thriv'd aboon in plunder, I think, they prosper't better under; For now the vestry was attacket; Presses and kists were hew'd and hackit, Wi' huge rapacitie and racket; Out-flew unwillin' to the licht, The gard-rob's bravities sae bricht, For Haly-days stor'd up aricht; Hands of unhallow't men out-dragget Pai's velvet-cods wi' silver taggit, And wi' their swerds them hash't and hagget Makin' them shabby cods and ragget. The bawdekyns and cloth o' gold, Stoles, towals, vestments manifold, The snaw-white albs wi' their parures, Fannouns and ither garnitures, The chesybyls wi' spangles thick, And Beaton's ain dear dalmatick, The hail o' them, by lawit fists, Were haurl'd and howkit frae their kists: For Paip's anathema or ban Car'd not a bodle onie man; And monie ane that day did herrie Braw spulyie frae the vestiary; The piper o' the brogh o' Crail Ran aff wi' ae priest's-vestment hail; The town's-drummer o' Cellardyke Stole Beaton's ain dear dalmatyke; (He wore it lang on king's birth-days, Like a cur-sackie owr his claes, Whan drummin' throu' the public ways;) Twa Regents o' Sanct Androis town, (Their names I sanna here set down,) Stole ane a stole, and ane a gown; But David Barclay had mair sense; In spulyiein' he shaw'd craft and mense; For albs or priestly vestiments He didna care a plack; He saw the styk o' th' water-ewer Glitterin' temptation on the flure; He cleek't it up, and to the dure He banget in a crack; And hame as fast as feet could carry He hurry'd frae that fierie-farie; That siller styk, for monie a year, Dan David, 'mang his ither gear, Fu' carefullie did keep; His bairn's-bairns lang stor'd it well; But now it's gane—as I hear tell; Tairge them about it now—they'll say, O' sic ane styk untill this day We never heard a cheep! Time, thus, wi' meikle greedy mou', Swallows up auncient things and true, And leaveth nocht to modern hashes But idle tales and empty clashes. Whilst Barclay wi' the silver styk Was owr the King's-muir runnin' quick, The kirk was a' displenish't; Of idols there remain't not ane; Priest's-claes and busking-clouts were gane; Capper and thack-lead aff were tane; Kirk-guttin' clean was finish't; Except bare wa's and lime and stane, O' that kirk's brav'ries left was nane; Her glorie was diminish't; Neth'less the meikle middle tow'r, Wi' her lang spindyl sisters four, Stood glowrin' a' the kintra owr, Up-struttin' in their pride o' pow'r As gawcy as afore; As lang as they stood brankin' sae Nae man could safelie brag and say That down unto the grund that day Was broucht the Papal glore; The gildet crucifix that shone The great mid-steeple's tap upon, Sae lang as it near heevin should stand, 'Twas but a sign to sea and land, That, shelter't underneath that taken, Rome's power, though shatterit and shaken, Yet in our land micht live; And aiblins on some after-time, Blude-nurs'd by Guise micht yet sublime Ereck her head and thrive; Thairfor, out frae the huddlin' crowd Ane College-regent bangin', stood Heigh on a graff-stane up, and loud Bespak the listnin' people; Gae, get Deaf Meg and Crookit Mou'; Stech their how hungry stammachs fou; And wi' them batter till it bow The meikle middle steeple; Gif ance yon cross were yerdlins come, Than, than, I'll think the pride o' Rome To be doun-cast, and seal'd her doom Within our land for ever; And our twa friends, I'll whisper you, Dinnelin' Deaf Meg and Crookit Mou' Allenarlie that feat can do; There's nane can crack sae clever: Nae sooner was the hint thrawn out, Than sax-score fallows swank and stout, Down till the Castill flew; And wi' great poust o' arm and leg The dinnelin' and dure Deaf Meg, And her sour sister lang and big, Out frae their port-holes drew; In twenty minutes a' the men Return't mair hearty back agen, Wi' cords and cables, micht and main, Haulin' the iron sisters twain, Wi' whoopin' and halloo; In thirteen minutes they were plantit Wi' mickle mou's that gap't and gauntit, Threatnin' wi' their first puff o' breath To blaw the bottoms out aneath The steeple's buirdly length; They needit but ae single spark To kendle them for that dure wark, And try their spit-fire strength; Out frae their throats wi' frichtsom gowl, As if a' Scylla's dogs did howl, Baith fire and soot and shot did rowl; Meg never frae her chokit thrapple Garr'd sae the bullets roar and rapple; Crook-Mou' did never in sic ire Vomit, wi' hurly-burly dire, Her stammach-fu' o' airn and fire: The pond'rous steeple wi' the brattle Did vibrate back and fore, and rattle; Frae her four stuttin' pillars stout Lumps of out-batter't stane fell out Enwrappit wi' their lime; And meikle pieces mair and mair Down tumblin' laid the inside bare, As the re-loadit sister-pair Aye guller't out wi' awfu' rair Their charges ilka time. As thir twa bombards on the ground Were thunderin' wi' an awsome sound, Up i' the sky, wi' michtier clutter, The clouds begoud their voice to utter, And correspondinglie to mutter; For now the vapours dark and dim, That a' day in the welkin's rim Had nurs'd themsels owr ocean's brim Wi' waters frae her wave, Now up the sky had spread and run, And wi' ane horrid tempest dun Had worry'd up the splendid sun, Narrowin' the ether's bricht expanse Into a black-hung uglie trance As gloomie as the grave; Great, gourlie, goustrous-lookin' clouds Seem'd jundyin' i' the air wi' thuds, And on the towns, and fields, and woods, Out frae their fissures pour'd the floods They'd borrow't frae the sea; Whilst thunder-vollies, peal on peal, And fudder-flashes mixt wi' hail, Garr'd bodies tremmle and turn pale, And kye on mountains flee; And little fishes, in the deep, Down to their laighest bottoms creep, And there their tangly coverts keep, That they mith not behauld the sweep O' fire-slaucht from on hie; Owr auld Sanct Androis city maist The fury o' that storm did rest; Owr her Hie-kirk, maist dark and dour The thunder-vapour seem't to lowr, As if upon the mid-most tow'r The cloud concentratit its power; Men lookit up wi' fear and dreid On the pit-mirkness owr their heid, Expeckin' some fell thing indeed; And as they lookit, in a stound, There cam a crack, that wi' its sound, Garr'd dinnel a' the houses round, And the haill hill to shake; At that sam mament rent asunder Frae cross aloft to bottoms under, By the tremendous pith o' thunder, The cannon-batter't steeple fell, Spire, arches, bartizan, and bell, Wi' roarin' ruin terribell, Maist like to ane earthquake; Masses o' stane, enormous blads, Down on the kirk wi' dunderin' dads, Tremendouslie cam tumblin'; That wa's, roofs, pillars did confound In ae destruction round and round, Makin' the haill kirk-yard rebound Wi' rattlin' and wi' rumblin'; A cloud o' limy stouff and stour, In spite o' the thick-gushin' shower Flew whirlin' up to heevin, As fain the thunder-cloud to meet And gratulate on hie, and greet The fiery-winget levin'; Wi' rubbish and wi' frush that flew Dinnelin Deaf Meg and Crookit Mou' Were maistlins bury'd up, I trow, And whelmit clean frae bodies' view; But it was wonder-luck, That wi' the smashery o' stane, Man, wife, nor bairnie, there was nane Murder't, or maimit, or owr-tane, Wi' breakin' or o' skull or bane; Nae wicht was scaith'd or struck: Sic tent they'd taken ane and a' To stand a gudly space awa Frae that descendin' steeple's fa', And keep themsels scart-free and hail Frae banes-breakin' or ither bale. Whan they beheld that steeple's ruin The yird wi' smokin' shivers strewin', They kent richt weil their endit wark, The consummation o' their dark; And hamewarts bairn, and wife, and man, Helter-skelter they skelp't and ran, The faster for the hail and rain That peltit on their pows wi' pain; As they intill their chalmers gat, Down to their suppers then they sat: They'd need o' cheese and bread, I wat, After the lang darg they'd been at. But whan the Pape in Vatican Heard o' the puir freirs how they ran, And how, despisin' bull or ban, Fife's fechtin' bodies, wife and man, His kirk had spulyied sae, Three days he in his mournin'-chalmer, Sat greetin' wi' ane eerie yamer, Makin' the Tiber ring wi' clamour And echoes o' his wae; The College, too, o' Cardinalls, They cast aside their fal-de-ralls, And spacier'd weepin' throu' their halls In doolfu' claes o' black; And ilka monk wi' grane and gaunt Made a heart-rendin' mulligrant, And pat on claith o' sack; As throughout Scotland there was joy, And gladness at that spulyie-ploy, Sae throughout a' the Papal lands, Was noucht but grief and wringin' hands, And sichan' 'mang the monkish bands, Allace me! and Allack!
