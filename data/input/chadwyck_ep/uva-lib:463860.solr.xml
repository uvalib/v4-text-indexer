Quhen Morpheus, w? his sleepie vaile, Apollo's brightnes did assaile, And forc'd him chainge his course, Towards ye Ocean streamis, To coole his burning beimis In ould Neptunus' source, And quhen the Night the Stigian caues had schroudit, And ye Horizons of myne eyes o'rcloudit, The Citherean boy in Airmes Appeird then, sounding Loues alarmes. Ane Ensigne displayed In sing of ware he bair, Quhose colours to declair ?it maks my hert affrayed, Resolu'd, by force, by subtil slight, or treassoune, To siege, and sack the Rampier of my ressoune. His campe was arm'd w? horrid night As one quho lothed to sie ye Light, A bow bent in his hand He caryed to invaid All such as durst wpbraid, Or contrar his co?and. Inventing then all the Ingynes he can, To brash my breast ye battery thus began. Cup. “?eeld to his powar quho rules and ringis Both ower mein men, and o're kingis; Quhose schafts hath ay subdued Ye most heroick hertis; Quhose flames and deidly derts No martiall mynds eschued; ?eild thou and learne how to practize and proue The heavinly Joyes, and suggared sweits of Loue. “Once taist yat nectared delyte, Of all pleasoures ye most perfyte, To spend thy tender ?eiris In loves lascivious layes Sporting thy ?outhfull dayes In Ven? wantoune weiris: O, so the springtyme of thyne age t'imploy, It is to baith in oceanes of Joy.” His speichis beutifully sainted, And for ye present purpose painted, Mou'd, (by thair chairming power,) Against me to conspyre, ?outh, courage, and desyer, To haist my fatall houer; Ressoune alone, to ratifie my right, To Cupid then replyed, suolne w? dispicht: R. “Cease, serpent, seik no to subdue And kill ane hert, bot for a vieu; Thy pleasour is bot paine, A dreame, a toy, a schadou, Lyk to a blooming meadou, Quhose pryd doth schort remaine. Thy sweitest joyes proue oft in end most sowre, Lyk to a fair sunschyne befoir a schoure.” ?outh then, with courage and desyer, All flaming in voluptuouse fyre, W? fervent mynds assayed My Sences to suppryse, Esteiming me wnwyse To ressoune to be tyed, So that, by only his adwyce and will, My actiounes all must be directed still. Z. “Fy thou,” (quod ?outh,) “faint is the spirit, Of lytill vertue, worth, or merit, Can tolerat to liue, Thrall to an oyers will, His humour to fulfill, As he co?and doth giwe. Fy thou, contemne such servile slawischnes, If any spunk of valour ye possesse.” R. “Peace, peace,” (q? ressoune), “stint thy tounge, No lesse he profits hes bein dumbe; Thoght thine owin eyes be blind, ?it woldst thou teach ane oyer, To saile w???? ane routher, Contrair both waue and wind; To losse ane Infinit and endles treassour, In hope to gaine ye fleiting frooths of pleassour.” I then perplex'd q? to performe, To hazard or escheu ?e storme: To suime in sueatned seas Now loues delights bereaues me: Now feir of falling greeues me, To such as raschly flies: Sua, now to loue, now contrairely inclyn'd, A field of fancies musterd in my mynd. To flie I long'd, aboue all things; ?it loth to trust in Cupid's wings, Tuix danger and desyer, Thus howering to and fro, ?outh newer ceas'd to blo, Forging affectiounes fyre. Bot ressoune, then, perceauing my estait, W? wraithfull voice did thus begin to threat: R. “Art thus thy vertue rock'd asleepe, Thy witt dround in a boundles deepe, Thy senses so ensnared, To sie and ?it miskno Ane labyrinth of woe, For ye (puir wretch), prepair'd? Behold h'ill proue, quho now doth ye promote, Ane monstruouse Minotaur to cutt thy throate. “Ane spytfull spidar, ewer spewing Ye poysonous potioune of late rewing, ?ouths venemous infectioune; In age, a doating madnes, A schort abiding glaidnes, A foolisch imperfectioune, A basse-borne passioune schairce rype till rottin, Tuix hatefull lust and Idilnes begottin.” C. Quod Cupid then: “Let ressoune raue; Its not his counsell thou must craue; Bot once his ?ock reject, And proue yat divine pleassour, That Joy be?ond all meassour, First from aboue direct, That heavinl[y] vniting of tuo mynds in one, Quhich nothing can dissolue bot death alone.” R. “Abstract,” (q? ressoune,) “then thyne eares Ye chairming Sirenes songs q?? hears, Flie ye voluptuouse voice, Quhich hes no other scope But guyde ye on ye rock Of thy perpetuell losse. In tyme tak heid then, least too lait thou mourne, Ye port is patent, bot w???? retourne.” C. “Behold,” (q? Cupid,) “ressounes schifts Of false philosophie consists; By sophistrie he schaues Loues ho?y to be gall, A bait only to thrall Such as obeys his lawes. Bot quho into such Rhethorick reposses, Lyfes sueitest joyes, and true contentm?t lossis. “Since then, to the, consists our stryfe, Of no lesse mom?t then thy lyfe, Present, befoir thyne eyes, Ye cause of our dissentioune, And ponder my intentioune W? ressounes fen?ied eyes. Let yen thy hert discern quho best doth merit. If subtile fraud, or faith, sould the inherit.” My hert, elected then to judge, Armies of diverse tho??? did ludge; ?it, out of judgments deepe, Did loue in end prefer, Quhose adversar did erre And thus pronunc'd decreit: Hencefoorth contemne, reject and banisch reassoune, A crocodoil, w? tears obscuiring treassoune. “Giue place to loues cælestial force, Quhich joynes tuo soules w?out diworce; Quhose vertue and true power No crosse can oght impaire, Bot still growes mair and mair, Quhen most it seimes to lowre. Since then this heavinly essence thus doth proue, Let death alone put period to thy loue.” Finis be me, W. Mure. II. MES AMOURS ET MES DOULEURS SONT SANS COMPARISOUNE. Quhill Beutie by a pleasant spring reposes, W? fairest schads of trees o'rschadoued, wnder; Ye cooling air, w? calmest blasts, rejoyses To sport hir w? hir locks, o'rcume w? wonder; So then, admiring hir most heavinly featour, I mervel'd much if scho was form'd by natour. The smyling blinks, sent from hir wantoune eyes, Had force to robe proud Cupid of his dairts; Hir schamefast, blusching smyles quho ever sies, Must pairt perforce, liuing behind yair herts. I stuid astonisch'd, greedie to behold So rair perfectioune as cannot be told. B. Scho then, perceauing me in thot perplex'd, W? voice angelicall did thus begin: “Thy gesture doth bewray thy mynd is wexed, W? crosses compast and invironed in: Schau then if loue, or q? misfortoune else, Such sings of sorow in thy saule compellis.” A. “No crosse at all, fair dame, no force in loue Can aght disquyet or perturbe my mynde. Ye wonders now ar present me doth moue To sie heavins excellence in humane kynd.” B. “No, Cupid the molestis, cease to deny him.” A. “Fy, treacherouse loue, fond Cupid I defy him.” Evin at this tyme the blindit god arywed, His bow bent in his hand ready to nocke: Bot q?? he aim'd, of power quyte deprywed, Himself he band in his awin flattring ?ocke. Feeding his eyes on beuties tempting lookes, His pain he thot to ease w? baited hookes. C. So boyl'd w? flames, vex'd both w? feir and teires, Out of the anguisch of his hert did plaine: “Ah, mackles dame, quhom all ye world admires, Pitty, I pray, my never ceasing paine. Do not thy rigour wnto me extend, Quhome once no mortall durst presume t'offend. “Bot now at last, o'rcume, I humbly ?eild; Save then or sloe ane captiue beggand grace: Receaue, in sing that thou hes won the field, Ye bow, ye schafts, ye quaver and ye brace, Once q?? I bruick'd, bot now w???? invy I yeild to the, more worthie thame nor I.” The homage endit, and ye goddesse airmed W? proud, presuming Cupid's conquered spoyle, He then, remitted, fled away wnhairmed: Bot, (woes me,) left behind his tort'ring toyle. Scho, spying me ?it wnacquaint in loue, Hir new got dairts throught my puir hert did roue. [B.] “Sport now,” (scho sayes), “w? Cupid: boldly try him; In loue if any force, no[w] proue, I pray: Too lait, I feir, thow rew thou did espy him, Thyne insolence 'gainst him or he repay.” Disdainfully delywring thus hir words, No small displeasour to my saule affordis. I, ?it ane novice in my new learned airt, Admir'd so quick a chainge from joy to woe; Doubted myself; ewin gif it was my hert; My tears, quhich trickling from myne eyes did go, Bot (ah) in vaine, for ?it my wound did bleede; No spaits of teires culd quench ye boyling leede. I flam'd, I fruise, in loue, in cold disdaine, Dyed in dispair, in hope againe I liued. All pleasours past agredg'd my present paine, Hir froune did kill, hir smyle againe reviued. Q?? death I wish'd, lyf then refuised to liue me: Liue q?? I wold, death then propon'd to riue me. Quhil in this weak estait, all meanes I soght To be aweng'd on him quhose schaftes did greiue me: Alace! ane faint persuit; I furthered noht. For he, now Cupid, now a spreit, did liue me. Thus metamorphos'd fled away for ayde, In Beuties lippes, q? I durst not invaid. Then favour beg'd, pitty moued hir consent Rendir ye fortresse, and his suirest scheild. Great searche I maid to mak ye wretch repent His bold attemps, intreating him to ?eild. Bot nather prayers could prevaile nor wisses, Then I resolued to kill him euen w? kissis. Afrayed he fled then in hir eyes to hyde him, Out of hir eyes into hir lipps againe. “Stay, fond wretch, stay,” thus I beguth to chyde him, “Or chuise hir hert, thou chainges oft in vaine. Sua, as by the, our lipps els ar vnited, Our herts als to conioyne may be invited.” Bot nothing could ye cruel spidar moue To liue his hold, delichting in my woe: Sche lykwyse, quhom I serued, bot scorn'd my loue, Lauching to sie my trickling teirs doune go. The more sche did perceaue increase my paine, The more sche mach'd my loue w? cold disdaine. Quhat then, sall I liue off my hope to speid, And liue no more, cros'd w? consuming cair? No! let hir froune and flit, yairs no remeid; I liue resolued neaver to dispair. Content I am, (and sua my faith deserwest,) My spring be toylsume w? a pleasent herwest. Finis, 1611. III. ANE REPLY TO I CAIR NOT QUITHER I GET HIR OR NO. To pleid bot q? mutuel kyndnes is gain'd, And fancie alone quhair favour hath place, Such frozen affectioune I ewer disdain'd. Can oght be impaird by distance or space? My loue salbe endles quhair once I affect. Ewin thoght it sould please hir my service reject, Still sall I determine, till breath and lyfe go, To loue hir quither scho loue me or no. If sche, by quhose favour I liue, sould disdaine, Sall I match hir wnkyndnes by prowing wngrait? O no! in hir keiping my hert must remaine, To honour and loue hir, more then sche can heat. Hir pleasour can nowayes retourne to my smairt, Quhose lyfe, in hir power, must stay or depairt. Thoght fortoune delyt into my owirthro, I loue hir quither scho loue me or no. To losse both trawel and tyme for a froune, And chainge for a secreit surmize of disdaine; Loues force, and trew vertue to such is wnknowne, Quhose faintnes of courage is constancies staine. My loyal affectioune no tyme sall diminisch. Quhair once I affect my favour sall finisch. So sall I determine, till breath and lyfe go, To loue hir quither scho loue me or no. Finis, 1614, 10 Octob. IV. ELEGIE. Alace! q?? I begin into my mynd to call The tragick end of Icarus and his most fatall fall; My stait yen worse then his, if any worse can be, Convoyed w? duilfull death, ensues to end the fait's decree, Lyk as he did presume, too hie w? borrowed pends, Bot by the raiging force of floods o'rquhelm'd but mercie endis. Sua q?? aboue my bounds fondly I did aspyre, Deceau'd by loues alluiring wingis, I fell in quenchles fyre, In quhich alace I boyle but mercie or retourne. Sche quhom I serue the fornace feeds, quhair my puir hert doth burne; Bot causles is sche blaim'd, in hir no wayt remaines, Nocht els bot cruell Cupid's ire my martyrdome constrainis. In endles pain I liue, in furiouse fla?s I fume, Death still doth threat my dayes to end, I sie no other doome. My passiounes ar extreame, my hert doth brist for woe, My tears lyk water from a spring doune from myne eyes doth go. Consum'd w? secreit sighs, but confort I remaine; Ilk thing on earth gainst me conspyre to agravat my paine. Bot most of all, alace! that sche by quhom I liue, Feeling, by simpathie, my smairt, from death wold me reviue. Bot (ah), the frouning faits, alwayes my fatall foes, Noch bot our mynds permits to meet, to periodize our woes. ?it tho? ane perfyte end in loue ye faits deny, Still sall I hir adoir and serwe, ewer till death envy: Resolu'd I am but chainge to loue hir q?? I liue. Let fortoune froune, the world invy, hir smyle will me reviue. And tho?, against my will, distant we must remaine, ?it in a breist sall both our herts no more at all be tuaine. Thoght crossis intervein to mak our myndis remoue, ?it still sall I most constant liue, death sall dissolue my loue. Finis, 1611. V. CHAUNSOUNE. Calling to mynd the heauinly featour, The baschfull blinks, and comely grace, The forme of hir angelick face Deckt w? ye quintascence of natour, To none inferiour in place, Oft am I forc'd, Altho diuors'd From presence of my deirests eyes, The too slou day To steil away, Admiring hir, my smairt quho sies. Thoght by myne eyes I sould distill, And quyt dissolue in tears my hert To satisfie hir causles smairt; ?it rather sche delytis to kill, Then any joy to me impairt. Bot since ye faits, Q?? ruils all staits, Such tragick luck to me doth threat, Do quhat sche can, Resolued I am To loue hir more then sche can heat. Altho sche froune, sall I dispair? Or, if it please hir prove wnkynd, Sall I abstrack my loyal mynd? O no! its sche must hail my sair. For hir I loth no to be pyn'd. Shee, I suppose, Lyk to the rose, The prick befoir ye smell impairts. Hert-breking woes Oft-tymes forgoes The mirth of murning, martyred herts. Finis, 1611. VI. ANAGRAME. To the Cupido ?eilds his golden dairt, Quhoise name aboue both fame and envy flies; No rair decoirment natour can impairt, Q?? doth not schyne in those sueit Angel's eyes, Heauin's admiratioune, and ye world's terrour, Earth's excellence, and loue's most machles mirrour. A machles mirrour of vnstain'd renoune, Quhair beutie, (by wnspotted puirnes graced,) Adorn'd w? chest Dianais sacred croune, (To tymes amaizment,) from above is plac'd; So that to the, in nather earth nor heauin, In all preferment, any match is giwin. Na maches giuin to equall thy perfectioune In diuin rairnes, vertue, worth, or witt. Euin so, (the heauins doth kno,) in true affectioune, In spotles loue, no maches I admitt. Since then on earth machles we liue alone, Justly, (sueit loue), we sould be mach'd in one. Finis, 1614, W. Muir. VII. ANE REPROCH TO YE PRATLER. Enviouse wretch, on earth ye most ingrait, In Venus Court thy libertie is loissed, Deseruing punischment as Momus mait, Misconstruing ladies mirrily disposit. If proud Ixion, in ye hels incloisit, Doth suffer tortour on ye restles quheele, Justly from all felicity depoisit, Junois discredit quho did not conceale; And if Acteon Cynthya's ire did feele, Turn'd in a hert, (thus for a vieu revengit), Much more thou, then, quho ladyes did reveale, In worse then he demerites to be chaingit; Form'd in a doge, to bark at such, most meet, As chalmer talk divulgats on ye street. Finis, 1614. VIII. TO YE TUNE OF PERT JEAN. Fair goddes, Loadstar of delight, Natours triumph, and beuties lyfe, Earth's ornament, my hopes full hight, My only peace, and pleasing stryfe Let mercie mollifie thy mynd! A Saturnes hert sould Venus haue? Or sould thou proue to him wnkynd, Quho humbly lyfe of ye doth craue? Since all thy pairts sum special grace Decoris, to schau thy heavinly race, Vertue thy mynd, and loue thy face, Proportioune braue thy featour, Pitty then must neids haue place In such a diuin creatour, Quhose sueitnes And meiknes Exceids ye bounds of natour. Quhen first thoise angel's eyes I vieued, (Tuo sparks t'inflame a world of loue), My fatal thraldome then ensued, Then did my liberty remoue. Thair first infected was my mynd, Loues nectared poysoune thair I drank, Thy sacred countenance so schyn'd So far aboue all humane rank. Let then thoise eyes q?? did insnair, (Those schyning stares), thair fault repair, Dispersing by thair beimes preclair The clouds of thy disdaining. Wosdome, vertue, beutie rair, In the haue all remaining. Let not then Ye spot then Of rigour be thy staining. Sould crueltie, (sueit loue,) ecclips Ye sunschyne of those glorious rayes? Or sould thoise louely smyling lips Breath foorth affectiounes delayes? Let mercie countervail thy worth, And measour pitty by my paine; Sua, thy perfectiounes to paint foorth Ane endles labour sall remaine. Lat beuties beames then thau away, (Reflecting only on ws tuay), The ycinesse of loues delay, And melt disdaines cold treassour. Natours due so sall we pay, Baithing in boundles pleassour, Inioying That toying, Quhose sueits exceid all meassour. Finis, 1615. IX. [ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME.] [In this version the first two verses are the same as in the other, with the following exceptions:— Verse 1, line 2, has “Triumph of nature,” for “Natours triumph.” Verse 1, line 8, reads—“Quho lyfe of the alone doth craue.” Verse 2, line 6, has “potions,” for “poysoune.” Verse 3 is given here in full.] Sould crueltie, sueit love, ecclipse Those eyes quhos smyls seame voyd of wraith? Or sould those soule enchanting lips Pronounce the sentance of my death? Banisch disdain, (my deir?), O spair In guiltles blood thy hands to stayne! Be bountifull as thow art fair, Measur thy pitty w? my pain. So shall my Muse rich trophes rayse To eternize thy endles prayse, Q?? heavins haue stars, q?? sune hath rayes, W? light all creatours cheering; Q?? Cupid's scepter earth o'rsweyes Nor great nor small forbearing, Thy prayse sall Amaze all Things sensible of heering. Finis, S. W. M., Rowallan. X. TO THE TUNE OF ANE NEW LILT. Beutie hath myne eyes assailed, And subdued my saulis affectioune. Cupid's dairt hath so prevail'd, That I must liue in his subiectioune, Tyed till one, Quho's machles alone, And secund to none In all perfectioune. Since my fortoune such must be, No chainge sall pairt my loue and me. Wosdome, meiknes, vertue, grace, Sueitnes, modestie, bontie but meassour, Decks her sueit celestial face, Rich in beuties heavinly treassour. Joy nor smairt Sall newer diuert My most loyall hert For paine nor pleassour. Bot resolu'd, I auou, till I die, No chainge sall pairt my loue and me. Tyme nor distance sall have force, (Altho by fortounes smyle invited), Ws tuo ewer to diuorce, By such a sympathie vnited. True loue hates Ye waw'ring estaits Of such as ye faits Hath chaing'd or retreited. But recourse in any degre, No chainge sall pairt my loue and me. Deir! Let death then only finisch, And alter alone our choyse and electioune. Let no chainge our loue diminisch, Nor breed from constancie any defectioune. Time nor space, No distance of place, Sall ewer deface Our ferv?t affectioune. Then, (sueit loue), thus let us decrie, No chainge sall pairt ws q?? we die. Finis, 1615. XI. ANE LETTER TO ANE MUSICALL TUNE. Gaise, eyes, on nocht quhich can content ?o? sight, Sad tragoedies behold alone! Ears, heir no sounds quhich can afford delight, Till sight and heiring both be gone! Hands, forbeare to tuich Oght ?o? tuiching can bewitch! Ah! since scho doth disdain, Eyes, ears, hands and heart, Seing, heiring, feeling, smairt All in one consort plain, Since sche, alace! Quhose bright angelick face Did sett my woundit hert on fyre, Will ?eild no grace, Regairdles of my cace, Bot doth against hir awne conspyre. Eyes, by ?o? streames of silwer trickling teares, Regrait, since sche is butt remorce! Ears, heir no sweits, since nothing sweit apears, Q?? thus the faits do us diworce! Die, most haples heart! Newer cease w? greif to smairt, In tears and sighs consume. Sorow, smairt and greiff, Be only thy releiff, Since sche hath giwin thy dome. Oh, (sueit!) then scho Compassioun on my woe, Or lett no longer lyf remain. Lyf giwes no more To cuir my inward soare, Bot ?eilds the greatter sence of pain. Hatred (alace!) for deirest loue I gain, (Ay me!) this is my best rewaird, And, for my paines, reaps wndeserwed disdain. My serwice sche doth thus regaird, Tho? I plead in vain Loue for loue of hir t'obtean, And humbly begs remorce; Thoght my tears doun rain, Q?? my sorowing cheiks do stain, Such is hir bewties force To charme my mynd, To liue, alace, thus pynd For hir, in such a ruefull stait, Resoluing still To wait wpon hir will, And loue hir more then sche can heat. Bot as the rose, in pulling, oft impairts The prick, before the smell be found, Sua may my Loue now, w? disdainfull dairts Thocht sche my hert but mercie wound. Sche the stroak did giwe, Only sche must me reviue, Thocht reuthles now sche proue. Such ane heavinly face Can not bot giwe pitty place, And ?eild at lenth to loue. Sueit! then, the more Thou heats, I sall adore, And serwe the q?? my breath be gone. My changles mynd No tyme sall mak wnkynd, Bot death my loue sall end alone. Finis, S. W. M., Rowallan, ?oungar, 1616. XII. HYMNE. Help, help, O Lord! sueit saviour aryse, Giwe ear unto my humble suits, and heir my wofull cryes, My sorowing sighes, (guid Lord!), do not dispyse, Awalk, my sillie saul, in sin q?? too securely lyes. Help (blessed Lord!) I pray, Thy servant in distresse; Haist, (sueit Jehova!) schune delay, My hynous sins redresse. Deir Father, I confesse Still yat I ran astray; Bot now recall me, not ye lesse, Out of ye wandring way, In quhich so long I have gone wronge, Alace! Accompany'd w? bluid convoyes. One drop afford, O heavinly Lord! Of grace, And cloath my sorowing saule w? joyes. Thyne ayde, O my creatour, I implore; Withhold from me thy favour now no more; Justly tho? I deserued thyne ire, And nothing bot hels fyre, ?it, Lord, I humbly the requyre, Contemne not my desyre. Erect my puir dejected spreit, Prostrat befoir thy mercies feete, Full sore affrayed to pleid for grace, Wnworthy to present thy face. ?it suffer not, sueit Lord, I pray, My silly saule decay, Bot once remitt, w?out delay, My sinis for now and ay.

Bereft of breath, ?it nocht from lyfe depoised, Heir lyes inclos'd Sanctandrois richest treassour, A pearle but meassour hath ye word ill loossed Quhoise mynd repoissed in no decaying pleassour, A machles Phoenix, quho, from mein estait, Becam a prelat and a prince's mait. A painfull pastour, worthy such a place, Too schort a space his natioune hath decoired; Quho now restord to earth, doth rest in peace, Receaued in grace, the heawins in sanctis hath stoired. Quhoise corps t'intomb, glaid ar ye sensles stones, Promou'd to honour by his buried bones, In Zoilum Thou then, quho by thy false and fenzied fact, Strywes to detract this prudent prelat's name, Bewar such schame becum thy suirest hap, Thrawin from ye tap of fortoune to defame. No blot, no blemisch, no defect, no moth Presum'd to enter in so rich a cleath. XIV. ANE EPITAPH (EFTER YE VULGAR OPINIOUNE) WPON YE D(EATH) OF GEORGE GLAIDSTANES B. of S. A. Glaidstones is gone, his corps doth heir duell, Bot q? be his oyer halfe no man can tell. The heauins doth abhor to ludge such a ghost, Quho still, q?? he liued, to Pluto raid post. The earth hath expell'd him, as loathing such load, Quho honoured Bacchus and no other god. Since both then reiect him, t' this outcast of heavin In midst of ye furies a place must be giwin; Quhose covetouse mynd no richesse contented, Bot heiping wp treassour wnmyndfull quho l?t it, Till contrarie fortoun, by turning ye dyce, Metamorphos'd his thowsands in milleounes of lyce; Quhich endit ye dayes of this sensuall slaue, Wnwordy the earth sould ?eild him a graue. By him quho wischeth that this wretches fait May giwe exemple wnto ewery stait; That hyer Powares be w? feir regairdit, Or by this Athist's punischm?t rewairded. Finis, 1615. XV.

Ah! q? ecclipse, q? night of sad a?oyis Thus hath o'rschadoued Phoebus' schyning face? Art natour's pryde, loue's mirrour, earthis true joyes, Fled and evanischt in a moment's space? Ah! art affectioune's florisch, beutie's vigour, Crop't in the floure, and slain by Clotho's rigour? Ah! art ye sunschyne of those machles beames In sorowes seas so suddenly gone doune, Lyk fleing schadoues, and deceauing dreames, Tomorrou clay, today perfectioune's croune? Ah! art ye world of hir rair Phoenix spoyld, And earth's decoirment by death's furie soyld? ?it nothing straunge, thot Joue chusd such a mait, This age wnworthy such a braue ingyne; And chaing't this mortal's mutable estait For ay in immortality to schyne. Thus sche, to quhom belou na mache's giuin, Triumphs in endles glorie, mached in heauin.

Be then comforted, ?e, whom natour tyes W? weiping eyes this spectacle to vieu. Heauins did afford, and now ?e heauins denyes This staige of toyes sould more retein thair due.

Each man w? silence stopes his mouth, and heares Sad newes w? wonder, bot my barren muse Fain wold brust foorth, bot ?it to wryt forbear[s]; Feir to offend must be my best excuise. Since malice thrists for braue Ephestion's blood, I'le wryt no Ill, nor dar I wryt no good. XVII. EPITAPH OF THE WERY EXCELLENT, VERTUOUSE AND TRULIE HONOURED LADY, THE LADY ARNESTOUN. Peace! wantone Muse, Leave now thy lovelie layes. Here, here a sadder subject thou doth fynd. Hence Helicon, hence Phoebus blooming bayes, The sorowing Cypres now thy brows must bynd, Ane Tragick Tokin of a mourning mynd, Quhich fain wold wtter, (if it could for smairt,) Thir latest dutyes of a dulefull hert. Quhat ey so cruell must no melt in teares? Q? flintie hert from sorow can refrain? Q? ruthles care, this tragedy q?? heares, Can inward anguish smother and restrain? O! sence wnsensible q?? feeles no pain, And, pittiles, doth not w? greif regrait This ruefull object and wntymely fait. Death hath subdued Wit, Vertue, Beutie braue, By conquering hir in q? those all remain'd. Nane humbler, meiker, modester, more graue, Mor wyse, more worthy, natour ewer framed. Few matches earth hath any quhair retain'd So prudent, patient, pittifull, but pryde. More courtesse, comelie creator newer dyed. Then nothing strange tho? Joue chus'd such a mait, This age wnworthy such a rair ingyne, And chang't this mortal's mutable estate, For ay in i?ortality to schyne; Quho glorefied amidst the schads dewyne, In place of wordlie transitorie toyes Reaps now all plentie of Celestiall joyes.

Too sone, (alace!) in blossome of thyn age Thy pairt is acted on this wordlie stage. ?it happie, happie thou, in earth quho lyes! Quhose ghost triumphes in azor-volted skyes! Lou'd q?? thou liu'd, of all, all now regrait In ?outhes Apryle thy far vntymelie fait. Bot ah! no eyes can render store of teares To mourne aneugh thy losse in such ?oung ?eares.

Machles Montgomery in his native tounge, In former tymes to thy Great Syre hath sung, And often ravischt his harmonious ear W? straynes fitt only for a prince to heir. My muse, q?? noght doth challenge worthy fame, Saue from Montgomery sche hir birth doth clayme, (Altho his Phoenix ashes have sent forth Pan for Apollo, if compaird in worth), Pretending tytyls to supply his place By ryt hereditar to serve thy grace. Tho the puir issues of my weak ingyne Can add smal luster to thy gloryes schyne, Q??, (lyk the boundles oce?), swels no moir, Tho springs and founts infuis thair liquid stoir; And tho the guift be mean I may bestow, ?it, (gratiows prince,) my myt to thee I owe, Q?? I w? ?eale present. O daigne to vieu Those airtles measurs, to thee only due; Q? thy auntcestors' passiouns I have schowne, Iff, (but offence,) Great Charles, Ile sing thyne owne. The most wnworthy of ?or hy: Wassels, S. W. M. XXI. THE KINGS MAIESTIE CAME TO HAMILTON ON MONDAY THE XXVIII IULY [1617]. Burst furth, my Muse, Too long thou holds thy peace. Paint furth the passions of thy new-borne joy: Forbear to sing thy lovelie layes a space; Leave wanton Venus and her blinded boy. Raise vp thy voice and now, deare Muse, proclaime A greater subject and a graver theame. Since our much lov'd Apollo doth appeare In pompe and pow'r, busked with golden rayes, More brigt heir shyning on our hemispheare, Nor that great planet, father of the dayes; With boldnes offer at his sacred shryne These firstlings of thy weake and poore ingyne. Great Iames, whose hand a thre-fold scepter swayes, By heavens exalted to so high a place, Both crown'd with gold and never fading bayes. Who keps three kingdoms in so still a peace, Whose love, cair, wisdome, grace &amp; high deserts Have maid thee Monarch of thy subjects' harts. Thogh thou by armes great empyrs may'st emprise, Mak Europ thrall and over Asia reigne, Yet at thy feet despysed, Bellona lyes: No crownes thou craves which bloodie conqueis staine. Whill others aime at greatnes boght with blood, Not to bee great thou stryves, bot to bee good. Whome snakie hatred, soule conceav'd disdaine, Hart-rooted rancor, envy borne in hell Did long in long antipathie detaine To eithers ruine, as they both can tell. Uniting them thou hast enlarged thy throne, And maid devyded Albion all bee one. O heavenlie vnion! O thryse happie change! From bloodie broyles, from battells and debait, From mischeifs, cruelties and sad revenge To love and peace thou hes transformd our stait, Which now confirmed, by thee before begunne, Shall last till earth is circuit with the Sunne. Jov's great vice-gerent, Neptun's richest treasure, Earth's glorie, Europ's wonder, Britann's pryde, Thy wit (lyk heaven) in such a divyne measure This litle world so happilie doth guyd, That Caesar, Trajan, Pompey, Alexander, If now they liv'd, the place to thee might rander. What wants in the (O king) heavens could impairt? Or what is in thee not of highest pryce? A liberall hand, a most magnifick hart, A readie judgment, and a prompt advyse, A mynd onconquered, fearcest foes to thrall, Bright eye of knowledge: singular in all. Thy waitchfull caire, thy ?eale, and fervent love, The Church, the laye, each high or low estaite Long-since by many worthie deeds did prove; Bot most of all by these effects of laite. For thou affects amongst thy high designs To build the Sanctuarie of the King of Kings. Heavens therefore did thy royall grandeur guaird; Thy Royall person from the cradle keap'd From thousand plots t'eclips thy Sunne, prepair'd By these who horror vpon horror heap'd Their barbarous hands into thy blood to bathe And mak thee (guiltles) object of their wrathe. Thogh Anak's cursed children did repyne, Yet heavens made Josua over them prevaill: Thogh hellish harts envyd'd thy glories shyne, Yet in the practise their attempts did faill. But loe, thy mercie still to be admir'd! Thou spared them against thee who conspyr'd. For as in all thou second art to none, To thee all kings in clemencie give place. Thryce happie people rul'd by such a one, Whose lyfe both this and after-tymes shall grace: Long may thy subjects, are thy glasse outrunne, Enjoy the light of thee, their glorious Sunne. What Load-stone strange had such attractive force To draw thee home-ward to these northerne parts? Whill Mars the world affrights with trumpets hoarse, Broyls inhumaine devyding humane harts; Whill Belgium braine-sick is, France mother sick, And with Iberian fyres the Alpes doe reik. Most lyk that fishe, whose golden shape of late Was to thee given, thy love to represent, Which in the Ocean thogh she doe grow great, And many foraine floods and shelves frequ?t; Yet not vnmyndfull of her native Burnes, Thogh with great toyle, vnto them back returnes. Rejoyce then, Scotland; change thy mourning weed; Now deck thyselfe into thy best attyre: And lyk a bryd advance thy chearfull head; Enjoy with surfet now thy soules desyre; Uncessantlie with sights importune heaven That thou may long enjoy this gift new given. Welcome, O welcome thryse, our glorious guyd; A thousand tymes this soyle doth thee salute; Welcome, O welcome, Britann's greatest pryde, By thee which happie doth it selfe repute. Thogh all-where welcome; yet most welcome heir; Long haunt thir bounds, ere thou from hence retire. Heir plesant plains alongst the crystall Clyd, Which in a flowrie labyrinth her playes, Heir blooming banks, heir silver brooks doe slyd, Heir Mearle and Mavis sing melodious layes, Heir heards of Deer defy the fleetest hounds; Heir wods and vails and echoes that resounds. Stay then, O stay, and with thy presence grace That noble race, which famous by thy blood, Long toyle and trouble glaidlie did embrace, And wounded oft gusht furth a crimson flood, In hazards great defending with renowne The liberties and glorie of thy Crowne. But leaving more to entertaine thyn ears With airie accents, hoarse and homelie songs, My solitarie Muse her selfe reteirs, Un-usd abroad to haunt such pompous throngs. Sua renders place that after emptie words Thou may partack such as this soyle affords. Sr. William Mure, younger: of Rowallan. SONNETS I.

Awrora's fla?ing hayre some fondly love. Quhyt dangling tresses, yallow curls of gold, Wthers in greatest estimation hold.

SONET. ?ow Heliconian witts, with arte who viewe The pain-borne brood of heaven-enspired spreits; ?owr presence, humbly, (loe), my muse invites, To taist of her fore-rypened fruits a few. Though meane and small desert for such be dew, Her strenthles pinneouns and vnhardned plume, As ?it in blood, no hyer dar presume, Till ryper ?eirs her infancy subdue. Accept what she doth painfully impairt With toyle and travell to begyle the time; And let, in her minority and prime, Her tender age excuse her slender airt; Not darring things of importance to write, With humble ?eale, (loe), she presents her mite. S. W. M. DIDO AND AENEAS. THE FIRST BOOK. Ising Aeneas fortunes, whil on fyr Of dying Troy he takes his last farewell; Queen Didoe's love, and cruell Junoe's ire With equall fervor which he both doth feell. Path'd wayes I trace, as Theseus in his neid, Conducted by a loyall virgin's threid. But pardon! Maro, if myn infant muse (To twyse two lustres scarce of ?eirs attained), Such task to treat (vnwisely bold), doth choose, As thy sweit voyce hath earst divinly strained. And in grave numbers of bewitching verse Ravisht with wonder all the vniverse. Rap't with delight of thy mellifluous phrase, Thy divine discant, and harmonious layes, Whose sugg'red accords, (which thy worth do blaze), The hearers' senses, at thair ears betrayes. O then I stowp as one in airt too shallow Thy never matched monarch muse to follow. But, ravisht with a vehement desyre, Those paths to trace which ?eilds ane endles name, By the, to climb Parnassus I aspyre, And by thy feathers to impen my fame: Nothing asham'd thir colours to display, Vnder thy conduct as my first assay. Sacred Apollo! Lend thy Cynthia light, Which by thy gloriows rayes reflexe doth shyne, That I, partaking of thy purest spright, May grave (anew) on tyme's immortall shryne, In homely stile, those sweit deliciows ayrs In which thy Muse admirable appears. And ?e Pierian maids! ?e sacred nyne! Which haunt Parnassus and the Pegas spring, Infuse ?our furie in my weak ingyne, That (mask'd with Maro) sweetly I may sing, And warble foorth this Hero's changing state, Eliza's love, and last, her tragick fate. Now bloody warre, (the mistres of debait, Attendit still with discorde, death, dispair; The child of wrath, nurst by despightfull hait, With visage pale, sterne lookes, and snaiky hair), By Groecian armes, old Troy had beatne downe, And rais'd the ten-?eirs siege from Priam's towne. Whose brasen teeth her walls did shake asunder, And staitly turrets levell'd with the ground; Insulting Greeks, with fire and sword, did thunder, And both alike the sone and syre confound, The maid and matron, striving to compence Fair Helen's rapt, and Paris' prowd offence. When Venus' sone, got by Anchises great, The noble prince Æneas re-units His scattered forces, dissipate of laite By Graecian furie on Troy's bloody streets, And sweetly chearing their dejected hearts, By sugg'red words he stryves to ease their smarts. “Lo! (champions bold,” quoth he), “quha fyr and sword, And thowsand dangers have with me eschewed, Courage and comfort let my words afford To ?ow, though now by sad mischaunce subdued. Blind Fortune favoures oft th'ignoble parte, But he is free keeps ane vnconquered heart. “Banish base sorrow, raise ?owr drowping heids. Vertue oppressed brighter still doth blaze. Let wonted valour, by ?owr worthy deids, Reconquere credit, and the world amaze; That ritch with spoiles and praise, ?owr prowes hie May be renoun'd with fame and victorie. “Learne, (noble warriours!) Fortunes storme to beir; And let ?owr valour be by vertue back't. The golden sunne-shyn of her count'nance cleir On vs againe may shyne, though Troy be sack't. Palmes, whil prest downe, ar loathest to give place, And Phaebus lowest showes her broadest face. “Since heir owr countrey, by the foe possest, And conquer'd kingdomes small content can ?eild; Since honour seldome is acquir'd by rest, But wonne by awfull armes in open field: Let vs a navie then prepair with speid With wings displayed the seas to overspreid. “In perill praise, in hazard honour lyes. Hiest attempts ar worthiest of renowne. And who do most death's bitter stroake despise, Fortune doth such with glory soonest crowne. Let vs resolve to suffer all assayes, To purchase fame, or perish all with prayse.” Thus said, their hopes half dead ar now revived; Their troubles calm'd: his speaches so prevaill. Their hearts of sorrow's heavie load relieved, Off suddaine joy strange passiouns do assail; All cry alowd: “Quhair ever thow dost leid, We follow the, owr prince, owr guide, owr heid.” Thair valiant chiftane speidily gives charge, With sayles display'd, to turne their backs on Troy. Now many a gailley, brigandine, and barge Rid ov'r the roaring billowes; whil with joy The Trojane fleet in armes to seas ar gone. Great Neptune with the burthene greiv'd doth grone. Their speedy cowrse amidst the maine they ply, And ways vnknowen search out, twixt foame and flood. Now scarce the soyle, with bleeding hearts, they spy, Quhair Troy, (Rome's stately rival whilome), stood; Whose ruines poore, which low in ashes lye, Doth force a teare from every gaizing eye. The pleasant plaines of Thracia then they coast, Which doth their eyes of native land deprive, Thence through the Ocean speedily they poast, Till now in sight of Delos they arrive. The Ile no sooner to their eyes appear'd, Till thither Palinure their pilote steir'd. Apollo there, in dark responses, told Of things to come the ?it-vnknowne event; And did in dowbtsome oracles vnfold Hid mysteries the curiows to content: Where now arriv'd their prince setts foot on land, His fortunes of the God to vnderstand. “Behold!” (quoth he) “before thy sacred schrine, Divine Apollo, the distrest estate Of Troy's poor remnant, servants all of thine; Brought lowe by Graecian furie, and by fate. Show to quhat soyle owr cowrse sall be addrest, Which after toyle in end, may ?eild vs rest.” “Renowned Prince! of heavinly issue sprung,” The God replyed, “Jove doth for the provide! Thy trophe's sall, (by after-ages sung), In times immortall register abide. Spread foorth thy sayles, to Italy repair; Thow and thy race sall swey the scepter thair.” Ravish'd with joy, with clamoures lowd they loose, And smoothly through the silver waves do slide. A gentle gale sweet Zephyrus bestowes, Which streight their cowrse to Italy doth guide. The azure face of heaven's broad looking-glasse With cannowse wings they quickly overpasse. But scarce the floods had ?it depriv'd their eyes Frome sight of shoare, and viewe of neirest land, Quhen angrie Juno, frome the christall skyes, Vpon ye seas the Trojane navie fand. Her deadly hatred and deep-rooted ire Inflams her minde, and sets her all on fire. But say! my muse, what crime so hynows hath Commoved the Goddes, who in furie fryes? Showe thow the source of her vindictive wrath: Why she this Prince so singulare envyes, Him tosses to and fro, deprives of rest? Are heavinly mindes with such despight possest? The Goddes heiring that demolish'd Troy Out of her ashes should a Phoenix raise, A natioune fierce, who Carthage should destroy, Her stately towres ov'rturne, and city raise; A martiall people far and neir to reigne, In warre invincible, so the Fates ordaine; This towne above all others to extoll Her native soyle at Samos Ile she leaves; Throughout the streets her hurling chariots roll; Her armes heir places, and great honors gives: And heir she mindes, (if Fates do not withstand), To found ane empire shall the world command. His kinde she hates, which should the same supprise, And Ganimedes rapt vpbraides her minde; And how her beauty Paris did despise The golden fruit to Venus who assign'd; Which most her heart with malice doth incense, No mends can expiat this hie offence. Her forme disprais't ingenders such disdaine As never female heart could ?it forgive. Beauty can not abide to beir a stayne, And with a rivall doth abhorre to live. Quhat can so loathsome be a woman told, As say she lookes deformed, fowl, or old? O cruell sexe! whose hate no time can change, Nor furyowse minde with sugg'red words be meased. As Hyrcane tigers, greedy of revenge, Bellona[s] fury far easier is appeased. For one man's caws no Trojane finds a shield. Who may resist whil heavinly broode doth ?eild? But what strange furie thus transportes my pen, Those creatures sweit of cruelty to taxe? Who now-adayes do prove so kinde to men, Apt for impression as the ?eilding waxe. Of this sweit sexe my muse doth pardon crave, Which thus misledde with Juno's rage did rave. The Trojane fleet now being vnder saile, Whil smyling Nereus with cups is crown'd; And mariners, glaid of the prosperows gaile, Their chearful whisles meryly do sownd. Enraged Juno, full of discontent, Thus doth apairt by words her passion vent: “Thus must I ?eild? thus my designes forgoe? And sall the Trojanes save arive on shoare Maugre my will? Have Fat's ordain'd it so? Of such a conquest justly [lose the] gloir? By Pallas earst for Ajax caws alone The Graecian fleet was sunk and overthro'ne. “Devoiring flames downe from the clouds she threw, Thunder and fireflaught, to avenge her ire. Waves threat the skies, a fearfull tempest blew, The rageing seas against the Greeks conspire. Himself, with fire transfixt, against a rock She dasht with whirlwind, quhair his corps did smoake. “But I, first Goddes, first by birth and place, Jove's spowse, and sister, heaven's arch-empresse great, With one poore nation never ?it at peace! What do availl my dignity, my state? Who Juno's godhead, thus contemn'd, sall feare? Or who sall offrings on my altar reare?” With heart inflam'd, from clouds with furie fleeing, The Goddes at Æolia doth arive; A land where tempests dwell, stormes have their being; In caves inclos'd, where murm'ring winds do strive. But Æolus, their king, with mace in hand, Theire rage restrains, and fury doth withstand. At such impresonement they oft, repining, Lowd bellowing all break out, with blust'ring noyse; But he in chaines more stoutly them confining, Tempers their ire, and calmes their roaring voyce; For if they were vnbridled and vnbound, Heavens, earth, and seas they should anone confound. The thunder great this fearing, then inclosed In caverns dark, fast bound with brazen bands: With hills supprest them, and a prince imposed To let or loose their rains, as he commands; To whom these speeches Juno fierce directed, With gesture sad, and ey's on ground dejected: “O Æolus! at whose imperiows word The storms arise, and swelling seas give place; My mortall foes, new scaip't the Graecian sword, The Trojans crosse the seas to my disgrace. Let louse the winds, thy rav'nows postes imploy, Disperse their navie, and themselves destroy! “Of all my nymphs, in beauty most excelling, Fair Diopeia sall be thy rewarde; Who, all her lyf in thy subjection dwelling, The as her lord and husband sall regarde; With the who many happy dayes sall have, And mak the parent of a bairne-tyme brave.” “Too many words, (great Goddes!),” he replyes, “Are spent in vaine, thy servand to entraite. My self, my scepter, and in me what lyes, Boldly command to execute thy haite. Jov's love by the I find, by the I reigne, By thee the stormes I raise, and tempests straine.” Butt more, him turning to the hallow hill, With silver scepter open passage made; The winds owt gushing heavens and earth do fill With hiddeows noyse, none in the cave abaide: They roar, they rush, and with a murmuring sownd, The elements all threatne to confound. To seas anone all furiows foorth they flew; 'Gainst East and West are Sowth and North opposed. Waves climb the clouds, a deadly tempest blew; Gray Proteus' flocks through foamie floods ar tossed, Which present death to sailing Trojans threatne. Men cry, and caibles crack by Boreas beatne. The day grew dark, night shew her sable face, Ane hoste of clouds did overcast the skies; Ane mist obscure did light of day displace, And load starre rest frome woefull sailers eyes. With lightning flashes thund'ring heavens gave light; Each where pale death vpbraids the Trojanes sight. Æneas now, (sad prince), in minde dismayed, With hands heav'd vp first having heavens implor'd: “Thrise happy ?e, my mates!” sore sighing say'd, “In Troyes defence who died by Graecian sword. O Diomedes, would to God that I, Kill'd by thy martiall hand, at Troy did ly! “Quhair noble Hector by Achilles spear, And stowt Sarpedon both their breathes did ?eild; Whose live-lesse bodyes Simois' floods did bear With bloody armes and many a woundit sheild.” Thus whil apairt he speiks, a contrare blast Doth force his saile against the trembling mast. Now helme-les, oar-les now, the shippe doth saill; Her ribbes do roare, her tacklings all are torne; The tumbling billowes fast her syddes assaill, She sinking sippes the seas, by weight downe borne. The fleet disperst, some to the heavins are throwne, To some the bottomes of the seas are showne. Thus tos't with stormes, the poore remaine of Troy Each to some speciall office him betaks: Some sailes pull in, others the oares imploy, Some the maine bouling hale, some tacklings slacks; Some hold the helme, some caibles cut in twaine, Some at the pumpe powr seas in seas againe. But all in vaine they strive 'gainst angrie heavin; In shallow shelves some vnawares ar cast; Some 'gainst a rock are violently drivin; And some in Syrtes sinking sands are fast; Some, (being robb't of ruther, mast and oares), With gaiping mowth the whirling poole devores. The remnant past all hope, now neir ov'rthrowne, Their leiking seames drink in the floods so fast, Whil Neptune wond'ring by what charge vnknowne The swelling seas their limits have ov'rpast; By what strange pow'r they have ov'rflow'd the plains, And who, (by his command), hath loos'd the raines. At which emov'd, his hoarie head he reares Above the waters, toss'd by Juno's wraith. The Trojane fleet soone to his eyes appeares, Some drown'd, some dying, some scarce drawing breath; Whome pittying, in the twinkling of ane eye The storme he stills, and calm's the rageing sea. Even as a rude concurse of people swairmes, A heidles multitude misledde by rage, Do fight confus'd; furie doth furnish armes; No meanes can their ignoble ire asswage. But if some man of eminence appeare, They quit their strife, and to his words give eare. Even so, no sooner Neptune show[s] his face, Till bello'ing Boreas calmes his roaring voyce. The striving stream's are suddenly at peace, And rageing tempests still their blust'ring noyse. With trumpets hoarse the Trytons sownd retrait. Waves war no more against the scattered fleet. Cymothoe applies her helping hands, With many a sea-nymph Neptun's cowrt frequenting; Who free the shipp's frome shoalds and sinking sands, To Trojan's pittyfull themselves presenting. The storme allay'd, they saiff away do slide. On smooth-fac'd seas the God by coatch doth ride. Now weary sailers with desired sight Discerne afarre the long-long wissed land; And thither plying, on the coasts do light Of Africk, where Queen Dido bears command. Frome Italy, a contrare cowrse, which driven, Of all the sailes none find the porte but seven. Soone as the rosie-fingered morning fair Left Tython's bed, and glaid good-morrow gave To Phaebus, blushing red, with golden hair, Ariseing from the Orientall wave: Wher Æneas early go's abroad, And leaves the shipp's at anchore in the roade. To see the soile he slumber sweit forsakes, Longing to learne what people thair do stay; Achates only he his convoy makes, Swa journey taks where fortune guides the way, By paths vnknow'n, perplexed much in minde, They travell long, but people none can finde. Till Venus last, disguised in shape, appears, Most like a Spartan maid in armes and weed; The gesture of Harpalice she bears, To whom the light-foote horse gives place in speed. Owt runnes swift running Heber's rav'nows streames; With bowe on shoulder she ane huntres seames. The heavenly treasure of her golden hair Was toss'd by sweet-breath'd Zephyr heir and thair; Her rayment short, her lovely knees wer bair, With which no snowe in whitnes might compair. Her eyes shin'd favour, courtessie, and grace, No mortall ever saw more sweet a face. “Stay, stowtly ?owthes!” (she sayes), “who heir resorte, And showe me if by chance ?e have espied Heir any of my sister nymphs at sporte, With bowe in hand, and quaver by their syd, The footsteps of a foamie boare who trace, And hallo'ing lowd, fast follow on the chace.” “None such we saw,” (quoth they), “O nymph divine! Or sall we rather the a Goddes call? Such heavenly beautys on thy face do shine, Thy gloriows rayes owr mortall eyes appal; But O! thrice happy Goddes, nymph or maid, Quhat e're thow art, we humbly crave thine aid. “Teach vs what soile is this, what countrey strange, What fields so fair heir to owr sight are showen, Vnder what climat of the heaven we range, Where neither man nor place to vs are knowne. We crave” (sweit lady), “if a stile so lowe Beseeme thy state, this let thy servants knowe.” “To me such honors,” she replies, “forbeare; For this the fashion is for virgins heir A bowe and quaver by their thighs to beare, And rayment short above their knee to weir. Of fertile Africk heir the soile ?e see, And those the walls of famows Carthage be. “The scepter Dido swayes, heir fled of late For horro? of Pigmalion's cruell crime, Against her mate in privy perpetrate, Which sad discowrse requirs a longer time. But things of greatest moment to discover, All circumstance I breefly sall runne over. “Sicheus was her lord and loyall mate, With many gifts of minde and body graced, Who her espous'd into her virgin state, A spotless maid, ?oung, beautyfull, and chaste. Her bloody brother over Tyrus raigned: No fiercer monster on the earth remained. “He, blind with greid, to gaine Sicheus gold Him vnawars before the altars slew, And forg't inventiounes to his sister told, Cloaking his cruelty with airts anew. But murther, though it ly a space conceal'd, By meanes vnlook't for, ay at last's reveal'd. “Himself, vnburyed ?it, Sicheus shew, Before this wofull lady's sleeping eyes, With visage wan, pale looks, and deidly hew, Whom, fearfull lyk, she trembling fast espyes, With gapeing wound, from whence a crimson flood Ran gushing downe his breast, begor'd with blood. “‘Flie! flie! my dearest half,’ quoth he, `from hence Expect no better at thy brother's hands, Flie him who kill'd thy husband but offence, And cruelly dissolv'd owr nuptiall bands; Whose cursed weapon Hymen's solemne knote Disjoin'd, which joined was so long by lote. “She, (wofull soule), appalled with the sight, Her fainting hands three times stretcht owt in vaine The shadow to embrace; but sadly sight When nought but air her folded armes containe. Three times againe, thus in her sleep misse-led Three times his ghost her kinde embraces fled. “Awak't, the charge she speedily obeyes; Prepares for flight, conveining such as hate This monster, who with fear the scepter swayes, And tyrannizing reignes with terrour greate. Whom spoiling, hence they fled with wealth vntold; Their shipps they ballast with the traitouoris gold. “Heir they arived, where now the walls arise Of stately Carthage, reaching to the skies. The soile she bought, along the coast which lies, Within the reach and compasse of ?owr eyes: First Byrsa call'd, as much in length and breid As she could with an oxen hide ov'rspreid. “But whence be ?e, (my freinds), who seame so sad, Whose ruethfull looks ?owr inward sorrows showe? Frome what far coast have ?e ?owr journey had? Or whither further purpose ?e to go?” To which, with wounded heart and watrie eyes, Sore sighing, thus the sea-toss'd prince replies: “Ah lady! if I should at length relate And of owr bitter sorrows showe the source; Owr adverse fortune and estrang't estate Requires a longsome dolorows discowrse: Day should departe and Phoebus bright descend, Long ere owr wofull tragedy should end. “Frome Troy we come, Troy was owr haples soile, (If ever Troy into thine ears fand place), By wind and wave heir toss'd we are with toile, Of heavenly issue and immortall race. Frome Jove I sprang; brought lowe, before thine eyes Æneas stands, whose fame surmounts the skyes. “To Italy Apollo did exhorte My cowrse: I follow'd where the Fates did guide; With twentie sailes, (alas!) I left the porte, Of which scarce seven saiff frome the stormes abide. Myself in neid heir strayes, to all vnknowne, Far, far from Europ, and frome Asia throwne.” But such regrates vnable more to hear: “Brave Trojane, be encourag'd,” Venus sayes; “Raise vp thine heart, such sad complaints forbear, Heavens guide thy footsteps and direct thy wayes. Hold on to Carthage, where Quein Dido reignes; Thy shipps ar save; thy mates alive remaines. “Even as those swanns, by six and six which flye, Doung by ane eagle in the skies of late, For joy of perill past all mounting hye, With wanton wings the ?ielding air they beat: Even so thy shipps, long toss'd on seas, in end With mirth and noyse all to the porte intend.” Thus having said, she turn'd away her face, Which made a sunne-shine in the shady place, With rosie cheeks and cheirfull smiling face, Such as Adonis earst she did embrace, Her sweet ambrosiall breath and nect'red hair, With musk and amber did perfume the air. He ravish't both with wonder and delight, “Ah! mother, stay thy cowrse;” sore sighing sayes, “Why, masked thus, dost thow delude my sight? Pitty thy childe, heir comfortles who stayes.” Ne're word she spak, but as they walk't in dowbt, She with a cloud encompast them abowt. The subtle air, (a wondrows thing to showe), In solide substance did the self congeale, With wonder rapt, environing the two, Themselves with mists enfolded thus to feel, To whome alone the cloud transparent bright, With thick'ned damps debarr'd all others sight. They, subject now vnto no mortall eyes, Hold foreward, where the Goddes them commands. She to her soile, by skies, to Paphos flyes, Wher consecrate to her a temple stands, Whose altars, which in odowrs sweet excell, With cassia, myrrhe, and cynamome do smell. They meanewhile to a mountaines toppe intending, From which the towne lies subject to their sight; The stately work with walls to skies ascending, The pompows ports with gold all glist'ring bright, The towres, on Porphyr pillars which arise, And mabre streets feed with delight their eyes. The workmen earnestly do their hands applie; Some dig the earth and search a solide ground; Some found below, some build amidst the skie; With noyse of hammers hollow heavens resownd. Some stones do roll; some vnder burthens grone; Some grave in brasse; some kyth their craft in stone. Lyk as when Phoebus, father of the ?eir, With warme reflexe the frosted flowrs revives, When natur's alchimists from rest reteir, And to the sluggarde life and courage gives. Whil some at home, some in the fields abroade, Their tender thighs with waxe &amp; hony loade; Assail'd by stormes, some litle stones do beir, And ballast thus do contrepoyze the winde; Some waxen pallaces with paine do reir; Some search a field the fragrant flowrs to finde; Some, bussied in the hyve, great murmure mak, Whil others of the brood the charge do tak. All wisely for the winter do provide, And empty combs with liquours sweet do fill; Parte at the ports, as sentinells abide, Vnloade their mat's and drowsie dron's do kill; The work doth prosper, Nectar-plenish't cels With thyme and cammomile most sweetly smels. Even so the Tyrians, some a stately stage On arches rais'd for comedyes ereck; For judgement some a place prepare more sage, Establish lawes, and magistrats eleck. Each with a sev'rall work employ'd tak paine: None sluethfull in the citty do remaine. “Happy! O happy ?e!” Æneas sayes, “Whose fortun's floorish, and whose walls arise.” No longer he vpon the mountaine stayes, But, ent'ring at the porche, seene by no eyes, Bereft with wonder he abroad doth range, Apparell'd with this airy rayment strange. A shaddy groave amidst this citty grew, Of amrows myrtles and immortall bayes, Which, heavenly sweet, deliciows odowrs threw, Whil Zephyr breath'd among the palme-trie sprayes, Whose topps, entwyn'd, a pleasant arbor made, Which ?eelded a delightsome cooling shade. Amidst this groave, to Juno sacred, stood A church with all choyse rarities enriched, Which, of no humane industry denude, All eyes with admiratioune bewitched, Who viewe what arte hath in this work devis'd, With curiows pencill, cunningly compris'd. Heir she to nature not inferiowr much, In shapes admir'd her excellence hath showne, The live-les pictures seeme to see, move, touch, With wondrows colours by the painter drawne: The statues stand, wrought with exceeding coste, By cunning craftsmen carved and embost. Æneas wond'ring at this temple's glory, And, with those sights, his sorrowing eyes delighting, Neir by, abr[i]g'd, he viewes Troyes tragick story, Drawen with such life as seem'd he saw them fighting: Great Ilion by triumphing Greeks suppris'd, Their bloody rage who prowdly exercys'd. Before the towne did stand the woodden horse; Whilas the ramme the walls is vndermining. The Trojans val'rowsly resist their force, In plumed caskes and glitt'ring armour shining. Now frome the ports the Greeks they seeme to chase, And now retreating, to the foe give place. Heir sent to death by Diomedes' hand, The breathles body of prowd Rhesus lyes. Heir Troylus, vnable to withstand Achilles' stroak's, by gloriows conquest dyes. Heir Priame doth his strenthles hands uphold, Sueing to ransome Hector's corps with gold. There, 'mongst his foes, himself anone he viewes, Acting his parte vpon this bloody stage, In Graecian blood his blaid who oft embrues, Arm'd with trew valowr, not misseledde with rage. There Memnon, there the souldiers of Aurore, Distill their dearest blood to conquere glore. But see! see how Penthesilea leads Her Amazonian trowpes to Troye's supplie! To all her valour admiration breids, But death and horrour to the enemy. All other women with their tongues mak warre, She, by her hands, more famows is be farre. But in this age such Amazons ar rare, Now strange Hermaphrodites supplie their place, Whose cloths, whose cariage, curlings, cutted haire, Complexiounes, coloures, ar their cheifest grace: Whose greatest study's foundlings to abuse; The mystery of painting how to vse. Viewing at last those vnexpected sights: “Ah, deir Achates!” sighing sore, he said: “In owr mishapps what nation not delights? What place doth not owr infamies vpbraid? Betwix the fyrie and the frozen ?one Our sad misfortunes are vnknowne to none.” But as no joy's so great as lasteth ay, So no mis-hap's so hard, but once may end. Dark night o'rpast, succeedes the pleasant day, Heavens, after sorrowes, joyes and solace send. So now, the lustre of Eliza's eyes Cheirs vp his spreits &amp; calmes his miseryes. Her presence soone gives respett to his teares; Her milde aspect him with assurance armes; Her beautyes peace proclaime vnto his feares; Her gratiows countenance his anguish charmes. For, loe, as Cynthia 'mongst the stars doth shyne, She comes attended with a stately tryne. Fair Iris in her choisest colowrs clad, Arayed in robes of pure blew-golden-green, Should in this cowrt have look't but pale and sad Amids the pompows throng which guarde the Queen, Who might have put a period to the strife 'Twix Juno, Pallas, and lame Vulcan's wife. More lovely creature never mortall ey, More ritch in beautyes, ever ?it did viewe, Whose lips of corall, cheeks of yvorie, Where lillyes sweet &amp; budding roses grew, The smothest pearle, and ritchest rubies stain'd, Still kissing and still blushing which remain'd. Her fore-head full of bashfullnes and state, Where Venus' babe did bend his Heben bowe, Of majesty and mildenes seam't the seate, Whose native white made pale the purest snowe. Two stars are fixt into this beautyes spheare, Smile-frowning, stormie-calm, and cloudie-cleare. Each glance alone of those celestiall lights Dairt foorth a living death, or deadly wound, And by allurements strange in snare the sights, And do beholders' senses quite confound, Whose silent rhetorick far more perswade Then all the airts enchaunting Circe hade. Each beawty, to attract the curiows eye, Hath something rare, peculiar, and alone, Which most the face with forme doth beautyfie, And leaves impression in a heart of stone. Some, sweetly smileing, kindle Cupid's fire, And, blushing, some adde fewell to desire. Some with the cherryes of sweet lips ensnare; Some with the dimples of a vermile cheek; By wanton looks some leave a lasting care, And others most do move by seeming meek. But heir, all beautyes in this object meit: O miracle of nature thus compleit! Even as Diana, by Eurota's banks, Or Cynthus' tops, with many a nymph attendit, With deep-mowth'd hounds the fleeing deir disranks; Some fall, by flight some have their lyves defendit. The Goddes egerly the chace doth follow, Cheiring her hounds with a harmoniows hallow. The wanton wod-nymphs fast abowt her throng, Both at her sport and heavenly shape amazed. She joyfully them traines the plains along, Still more admiring, more on her they gazed. For loe! she shynes amids this crew more bright Then clear Aurora, parting frome the night. So ent'red Dido: such her princely port, A sweit, majestick, and heart-moving creature, With pompows splendour, far above report, But airt adorn't, with beautyes choysest feature, Whose gracefull gesture, whose enchanting eyes, Æneas' sorrows seam't at once to ease. Magnifickly thus mounting to her throne, Weiring a costly coronet of gold, The sword of justice to her subjects showne, The scepter her imperiall hand doth hold; Where, guarded with a groave of awfull armes, She sitts secure frome spightfull traitors' harmes. There, like that nymph who fled from earth to heaven, So much by all for equity renown'd, Of justice she doth hold the ballance eaven, And solidly doth lawes and statutes found, Wherby good subjects easily are rain'd, The viciows sort by fear and force restrain'd. The Queen scarce plac't into her yvorie throne, Whil suddenly a companie arives Of souldiers, as it seam't to all vnknowne, Which preassing, as perplex't, for presence strives: Sergestus, Antheus and Cloanthus strong, Were leaders of this vnexspected throng. Three Trojane captanes with their trowpes attendit, New scaipt the furie of the boyst'rows king, Heir last on shoare, whil otherwise intendit; Heaven's angry Empresse hindred their designe, Their ships assailing on the wattrie plaine, Till Neptune calm'd the swelling seas againe. Their prince, his people heir at cowrt espying, In Thetis' bosome whom entomb't he trowed, Amaz'd he stood, with deep attention trying If visions false his eyes did overcloud, If apparitions or chymerœes vaine Appear'd, illudeing his distempered braine. But finding heir his followers in effect, Sick with a surffeit of excessive joy, He long'd himself vnmasked to detect, That mutuallie they comfort might enjoy; But, seasouning this passion with feare, Their sute to Dido first resolves to heare. Meanwhile Ilioneus doth humbly kneel, And thus the Queen with reverence doth greet: “Great Princes! we, (poore strangers), do appeale To thy protection, prostrate at thy feet, Embold'ned by thy virtewes to draw neare, And in thy sacred presence to appeare. “We, wofull Trojanes, wand'ring in exile, Long toss't abroad vpon the troublows seas, Do humbly crave to rest with the a while; Let not owr sute thy patience displease; But, (gratiows Princes!), pitty owr distres, And over vs thy people's pride repres. “To raise thy cittyes and returne with spoile, To no such end we did vs heir addresse; We, being objects of disgrace and toile, No such prowd thoughts owr conquer'd mindes possesse. Whil first we did on foamie seas ascend, To Italy we did owr cowrse intend. “Scarce did the floods owr sight from shoar divorce, Whil mad with furie, and inflam'd with rage, Lowd bellowing Boreas prowdly offers force, And maid owr navie of his pride the stage. The elements, all intermixt in one, Owr ships were soone disperst and overthrowne. “A Prince we had, (O had!), word full of grieff! By name Æneas, great in armes and fame, Whom, if the heavens preserve for owr relieff, Feir no; thy fortoune thow shall never blame, That we by the ar favor'd for his caws.” Thus, with a sigh, the Trojane maide a pause. Her waxen heart, touch't with a trew remorse, And sympathie of their distrest estate, Did her compassion in such sort enforce, As, sweetly smileing, from her regall seat: “Cheer vp ?o? mindes, (brave Trojanes),” she replyed; “Exile base sorrow, be no more dismayed. “What people are so barren of engine, As have not heard of great Æneas' name? Troyes ancient splendour? of her gloryes shine? With longsome warre how Mars did her inflame? To vs ?our vertewes admiration breeds, Amazed much by ?owr heroick deeds. “If hence ?e minde, free pasport I will give, And, with a lib'rall hande, ?owr wants supplie. Or, if my kingdome can ?owr woes relieve, Welcome! thrise welcome, heir to stay with me! If Trojanes can submit them to my throne, Trojane and Tyrian sall to me be one. “And O! I wish ?owr brave, illustruows prince, With whose renowne the earth's seaven climats rings, Were heir; if heavens have not him ravish't hence, But do reserve for some vnknowne designes, Happy, how happy should Queen Dido bee, To succour him in his extremitie.” Scarce had she endit till the airie cloud, Which him encompas't, vanisht owt of sight, And he, deliv'red of his sable shroud, With sudden wonder, shyn'd into the light, More lyke a God then any earthly creature, So perfect he appear'd in every feature. With stately shape, a smileing awfull eye, A piercing look, a sweet majestick face; The golden treasure of his locks which lye Adowne his shoulders with celestiall grace, In heavenly hew excell'd that far sought fleece, Gain'd with such hazarde by the ?owth of Greece. Now see how Dido narrowely doth eye him, Into her heart great things of him divining; With admiration all the cowrt espye him, Vpon his royall brow true vertue shining. No dame so chaste but, spite of all defences, Must ?eeld to love, him viewing with right senses. “Behold,” (quoth he), “great Princes, in thy sight, The man for whome thow kindly dost enquire; Thy humblest servant, if a sea-tost wight, Infolded in misfortune's sad attire, Can be thought worthy the, (dear Queen), to serve, Who dost so infin'tly of vs deserve. “Thow onely with owr miseryes art moved; By the alone we comfort do enjoy; Thow only kinde and pittyfull hast proved To vs, the poore distrest remaine of Troy. We only by thy gratiows favour breath, Near ent'red at the frozen gates of death. “Thow, feelingly enflam't with ?ealows fire, Our indigence dost vndeserv'dly aid, The wofull objects of proud Æol's ire, Whom heavens each where, by sea, by land, invaide; The scorne of time, the mirrour of mishap, Of deepest grieff the most expressive map. “Can e're thy bountyes be by vs repayed? All-vertuouse princes! Africk's gloriows starre! We straying Pelerins will ne'r assay't, Thy great deserts exceed owr pow'r so farre. Jove, dowbtles, Dido duely sall rewarde, If Jove doth rueth or equity regarde. “Whill night's clear torches in true measure daunce To heavenly accords of harmoniows spheares, Whil Phoebus' steeds abowt the Poles do praunce, Earth's pond'rows masse whill giant Atlas beares; Thy fame, praise, glory, and thy partes divine, Shall last, enrol'd on times immortall shrine. “And, whill the heavens dissolve owr bodyes frame, Thy kindnes no oblivion shall blot owt.” Thus having said, burnt with affection's flame, His subjects he embraces all abowt. Hands join'd in hands, joy hath their hearts transfixed, Both smiles and teares at once ar intermixed. “Great Cytherea's sone!” the Queen replied, Ravish't with wonder of this object strange; “What fortune heir thy wand'ring steps doth guide? How coms't thir costs thow solitare dost range? Art thow that Prince, by progeny divine, Whom great Anchises gote on beautyes Queen? “My father Belus, (well I do record), Whil wasteing Cyprus with victoriows hand, To Teucer's aide, who by the dint of sword Most violently was expell'd the land; Their first thy fame did sound into mine eare; Their Troyes distres and ruine I did heare. “Like bitter fortunes als myself have proved; But, greiff digested, sweet content redowbles. Afflicted wights to pitty I am moved, Not inexpert in woe and saddest troubles. Rest heir, Æneas, in thir partes a space, For bloody broiles enjoying blessed peace.” Butt more, descending frome imperiall seate, Her ghuests she guides into a pompows hall, Then holy-dayes proclaim'd with triumph great, In honour of th' ensewing festivall: A Hecatombe is offered, beasts are slaine To Neptune, ruler of the glassie plaine. The regall palace, royally prepar'd, With hangings ritch is sumptuously decor'd; In midst the tables, on ritch pillars rear'd, With silver plate are plentifully stor'd. On which, laboriowsly engraven in gold, The Princes' royall pedegrie's enrol'd. Æneas now discharg't of heavy care, Preparing to refresh his fainting sprights, Ascanius' absence only doth empare His perfect joyes, enless'ning his delights. Such was the tender, fatherly respect Whereby his child he dearly doth affect. “Achates, haist,” (quoth he), “at length relate To that sweet Boy, who in the ships doth stay, The period of owr paines, owr present state, How calme a night hath still'd owr stormie day. Be thow a guide vnto his footsteps weake, That of owr pleasures heir he may partake. “And those few tokens, which alone do laste Of all the treasures of demolish't Troy, Bring with that hopefull childe to vs in haste; The costly jewells Helen did enjoy, Her ritch embroid'red robes, the scepter rare, And crowne, which fair Ilionea bare. “With these the Queen I purpose to present, Small pledges of these duetyes to her due. Whill smoothest words to no effect are spent, Gifts, (strange perswadeing oratours), subdue, And force the firmest mindes, do still prevaill, Whil complements and kindest speaches faill.” But whill Achates for Ascanius hyes With winged pace: Loe! frome the cristall skies, The Cyprian Goddes suddenly espyes Th'event of all; who doth anone devise That Cupid shall assume the shape and face Of sweet Ascanius, and supplie his place, And so the Queen with furie strange enspire, Into her bosome breathing love's infection, And kindle in her breast a boyling fire, A quenchles flame of violent affection, Whose deadly poyson, once infused deep, May peice and peice through all her arteirs creep. And whill he doth present the ritch propyne Of Trojan reliques, in Ascanius' shape, He may, (vnwarre), the Princes vndermyne, And craftily her liberty entrape; So, being once enamor'd on her sone, May free his danger her suspition. “Cupid, my sone,” saith she, (for Cupid still's Attending Venus), “thow my strenth, my stay, Whose trophes great both heavens and earth do fill, O'r gods, o'r men, who dost thy scepter swey, Behold before thy sacred Deity, Thy mother Venus comes entreating the. “With what despight, (thow knowes), Jove's jealows wife Thy brother, dear Æneas, hath persewed, Whom, nixt to the, I tender as my life, My joy, my cheifest care, and neir subdewed On Neptun's a?ure bosome, to my smarte; Thow of my woes hast oft made vp a parte. “Him Carthage now containes; Loe! how the Queen, With sugg'red speaches, much his stay importunes, And royally her ghuest doth entertaine, With kinde compassion on his former fortunes. But what these gloriows guilded sho's portend, It's hard to constre: O! I fear the end. “In Junoes citty, since by Juno hated, How can he draw secure one minute's breath? Since no where saiff, but by her furie threated, Heir, at her pleasure, she may plot his death. No place more oportune, no time more fit, Such inhumane a murther to commit. “But hark! deir infant, Loe! I have devis'd A policie all perill to prevent. Queen Dido, by thy slights, must be suppris'd; A secret flame must frome thy forge be sent To boyle her breast, her minde to fancie move, Æneas only object of her love. “Now fit occasion favors owr designes. The lovely boy Ascanius goes to cowrt. Lay thow aside a space thy shafts, thy wings, Put on his person, and his princely porte. A child, thow mayst a childe in shape resemble, More subtilly with Dido to dissemble. “That whil embraced, cherish't, entertain'd, The nectar of thy balmie lips she seiks, And whil she clasps the in her armes enchain'd, Redowbling kisses on thy rosiall cheeks, Thow privily may in her veines enspire A pleasing poyson, a deceiving fire.” Cupid obeyes the Goddes' charming voice. An humane shape him instantly investes. Of sweet Ascanius' shadow he maks choise, And of his wings himself anone devestes, Layes downe his bow and arrowes, one by one, So with Achates to the cowrt is gone. But, least Ascanius should the guile disclose, To Ida wods the Goddes him doth beare, Where pleasant slumber, rest and sweet repose Lock't vp his eyes; and Morpheus drawing neire Seas'd on his senses, in the cooling shade Which lillyes sweet and budding roses made. So now, whil Dido doth her ghuests entreat, With choisest cowrses and deliciows faire, Loading the tables with all sortes of meat, Which ?ielded are on earth or liquid aire, An hundreth groomes, with diligence and skill, Giving attendance on the strangers still. And whill Iöpas sweetly doth expresse With warbling voice, and yvorie instrument, The motion, order, cowrse of great and lesse, Fires fixt and straying, in the firmament; How Phoebus eyther hemi-spheare enflames, And how his thunders Jove, and lightnings frames. How Mars and Venus Vulcane did ensnare; How stars' aspects benigne or froward bee; How Iris bends her bowe amids the aire; How rolling spheares resound harmoniowsly: Lo! suddenly amids this joyfull throng, Ascanius, comming, interrupts the song. For, as he ent'red, all with greedy eyes Gaze on the beautyes of the lovely boy. Resplendant rayes his visage beautifyes, His chearfull countenance augments their joy. Smiles grace his gesture, which in them doth move Amazement, wonder, joy, delight, and love. They mervell at Æneas ritch propyne. They mervell at the boy the gifts doth bring. They muse a mortall's face so bright doth shyne, Mistaking him to be a God, a king, A mighty monarch, whose imperiows hand Bears over all the vniverse command. But none, so much as Dido, him admires: In this sweet object such delight she fand, She, in his breast, (as fixed starrs), ensphears Her sparkling lights, which still butt motion stand. But, still the more, her starving eyes she feeds, Desire encreasing still the greater breeds. The silver beames abowt his locks of gold, The heavenly lustre of his shining face, Her more and more still in amazement hold. Within her breast she finds no rest nor peace, But, surffeitting on such vnusuall sights, Although enflam't, she in the flame delights. Thus, whill she feeds, she pynes herself away, (An harmeles flie allured by the low); Her self, vnwar, thus doth her self betray, And feels the force of this small archer's bowe, Whose eyes alone, sweet, cowrtes, voide of ire, Dairt lightnings foorth, a world of love to fire. But now the Syren, by enchantments false, The senses charmes of his supposed syre, Now sucks his lips, now hings abowt his halse, With kinde embraceings kindling his desyre. He tenderly his child doth intertaine, Mistaking whome his folded armes containe. His cowrse, anone, vnto the Queen he takes, Whose marrowe boyles already in her bones. She, for the cherries of his lips forsakes All other daintyes, and in love suppones A sweeter issue, nor experience bad, In end expressed, in characters sad. Within the prison of her yvorie armes, The infant clasping closely, she confines; And to her foe's assaultes herself disarmes, Vnwar, her liberty who vndermines, And ignorant she holdeth on her breast So great a God, so dangerows a ghuest. He, peice and peice, the dear remembrance kills Of late Sicheus, who her love enjoyed, And empty veines with living fire he fills, Her former flames which quickly have destroyed; Her heart, long disaccustom'd now to love, Affections strange and passions new doth prove. Now is the Queen ensnar'd with Cupid's airts, By love led captive to a suddaine change. She feels the poyson of his deadly dairts To work in her by operation strange. But none her trembling pulses neids to finde. Her eyes bewray the sicknes of her minde. O love! how many are thy subtle snares, To conquer beauty and to climb her forte; Vowes, protestations, prayers, sighs and teares, And cowrting strange in many a sundry sorte, Betray poore women. Nature beauty made Both to be loved and proved, nought die and fade. Now silent night spred foorth her sable wings, And broad display'd her spangled cannopye. In fire, air, sea and earth, all living things, Which moving, flying, creeping, breathing be, Did rest, in pleasant slumber buryed deep, Save she whose wakeing thoughts impeacht her sleep. Heir endeth the First Book. THE SECOND BOOK. The quein, sore sick of love, surcharg't with care, In wounded veines a secret flame doth feed. Æneas' vertue and his stemme preclare, Still, in her ravisht minde, a place doth pleed. Both voyce and eyes one onely object hold, A masse of cares her restles thoughts enfold. If slumber sweet vpon her senses sease, Her troubled braines, with visions new acquainted, Present her lover still before her eyes, The object which by day they most frequented. Awak't againe frome her vnquiet rest, She finds her spreit with passions strange possest. Her beating pulses and her panting heart Showe the distemper of her troubled minde. No practise, humane industry, nor airt, For her infection a remeid can finde; Whose spreading poyson wholly hath ov'rrunne Her veines, ere scairce she knew her grieff begun. With purpure blush, soone as the morne displayes Heaven's cristall gates, (dayes golden beames recall'd), “Deir sister Anna,” sighing sore, she sayes, “What dreames, by night, my senses have appal'd! What apparitions did vpraid my sight! And broken sleeps, with sudden fears, affright! “What ghuest so strange hath heir ariv'd of late? How brave of gesture! and in armes as great! Whose eyes, of humble majesty the seat, With grave-sweit looks, imperiowsly entreat. What broyles, what battles, what enconters bold, Hath he ov'rpast with courage vncontrol'd! “If most advis'dly I did not resolve, Myself to none in nuptiall bands to joine, Since death my first affection did dissolve, And sacred Hymen's solemne knot disjoine; To his assault, (if vnto any one), I might be moved, (perhaps), to ?eeld alone. “To the, (dear Anne), to the I must reveale, Since death frome me Sicheus did divorce, Who prowd Pigmalion's cruelty did feele, This man alone my fredome did enforce. He only hath enflam't my dead desires; I feel the footsteps of my former fires. “I feel within the fornace of my breast A secret flame, a close confined fire; What hope is left to smother and supress't? Which bred my sight, is fostered by desire; O how I frye and freize, I faint and feare. How great a loade, (alace), is love to beare! “What passion strange, (poore Dido!) thus transports the? Love bids the ?eeld the in a stranger's will. But honor tells how highly it imports the, With headles haste thy pleasures to fulfill. Since flying beauty most enflames desire, And sweet deniall kindles Cupid's fire. “Love bids the runne where sweet delight doth leade, And prove those pleasures which to ?owth belong; But honor doth advise the to tak heade, Thy spotles fame and princely partes to wrong. Since vertue's field is easily laid waste, And meates vnwholsomest most please the taste. “Nay, rather earth devore me first alive, And, Erebus' dark shad's enclos'd among, Let thund'ring Jove me of my life deprive, O sacred modesty, ere I the wrong! Or ever prease the statutes to eschew, Of shamefastnes which to my sexe is due. “He, he, (alace), to whome I first was fast, My soules affection hes frome hence transported; O let it with his ghost for ever last, Entomb't with him, where first my love resorted.” This said, her eyes a cristall flood foorth powre, And on her cheiks distill a pearlie showre. “Sweet sister,” Anna then at lenth replied, “Dear as my life, more then my self affected, Still shall thy ?owth to mourne alone be tied? Are childrene deare, by the, no more respected? Hatst thow so much those joyes which Venus brings? And think'st thow soules departed care such things? “Although, when sade melancholie of late Seas'd on thy minde, all sutes thow didst reject; No Lybian husband, not Hiarbas great, Nor Africk captaine couldst thow then affect; But canst thow now resist, and not approve The sweet effects of such contenting love? “Thow weyes not well what bounds thow dost possesse; Heir the Getulianes and Numidians stowt, Heir Syrtes sands, famowse in barrennesse, Heir the Barceans compas the abowt; What shall I speak of Tyrus' new debates, Which now arise, and of thy brother's threats? “By heaven's assent, (I hope), and Junoes aide, The Trojane ships have heir the cowrse intended; What citty, (sister), sall of this be made, If such alliance prosperowsly wer ended? What reignes arise, if Troy with vs wer one? With what triumph should Africk shine anone? “Plead first, frome heaven, protectione divine, Pretending cawses to thy ghuest of stay, Till stormes be still, the seas to smile incline, Ships saiff may saile, and heavens their furie lay.” Her kindled breast thus Anna did enflame, Swa hope she caught, exiling dowbt and shame. How easily do women women move, To whome they truste the secret of their heart! By her perswasion, O how quick doth love Disperse the self, and spreed in every parte A furiows flame, a fumeing fever fell! No antidote this poyson can expell. To church they haste, and first heaven's peace entreate, On altars off'ring to the gods above, To Ceres, Phaebus, and to Bacchus great, To Juno chiefly, who hath care of love. With cuppe in hand, the Queen herself doth syne Powre foorth vpon the sacrifice the wyne. Or at the altars off'ring gifts she spaces, Observing what new Fortunes do ensue; Marking the bowells, and the breathing places Of every beast, with most attentive viewe, Which open to her sight; with narrow eyes, She gaz'd and guess'd; what all doth boad she sies. Ah fond conceits! What do her vowes availl? Or what do temples sought her rage empare? Whill as her marrow doth already faill, With soaking flames consumed, dry'd vp with care, And whill enclos'd into her breast profound, She nourisheth a deadly feast'ring wound. Like as the dear, which wounded vnawar, With hunter's shaft fast fix't into her side, Runnes headlongs heir and their, both near and far, But still the dart doth in her breast abide, So Dido, poyson'd with a deadly head, Butt rest doth rage, sore martyr'd but remeid. Through stately Carthage now her ghuest she guides, With gloriows shows to entertaine his sight; Now sumptuows banquets painfully provides, With variows objects surffeiting delight. Then Trojane toyles with burning minde to heere, Oft she entreats, and gives most watchfull eare. But whill she speaks, her speach confus'd doth faill, Whill frome her minde her wav'ring tongue debordes; With looks anone she doth anew assaill, Dumb oratours perswading more then words; Whose silent language doth most lively teach, How meane a messenger in love is speach. For loe! her eyes, the index of her minde, With piercing lookes imperiowsly entreate, And tell her lover that, too long vnkinde, He overlookes her passionat estate. O heavenly Rhet'rike! which butt words reveals What modesty in women still conceales. But ah! whil he is gone, and night's pale face Day doth displace, provoking pleasant rest, Oft she alone laments, oft doth embrace The happy place which he of late imprest. Oft to her trowbled senses it appeares, That him still present she both sees and heares. Then ?oung Ascanius she doth entertaine, His parents portrate perfectly presenting, Whome in her armes she softly doth enchaine, By sweits suppos'd, her sowres of life relenting. Thus stealing by the slowely sliding howres, So to subdue loves still assailing powers. Her careles minde, slouth, meanwhile, doth supprise; Buildings begun ar left: ?owth armes despise; No bullwarkes brave, no rampiers rare arise, But all engine of warre imperfect lies. No martiall thought her minde doth more retaine, For love and slouth insep'rable remaine. When Juno, from her azure pale, espied With such a frensie Didoes minde infected; And when her furiows fever, such she tried, As no reporte nor rumour she respected, To Venus first her cowrse she doth direct, And to the Goddes thus begowth to break: “How great thy conquest, glory and renowne! Thy boy and thow victoriows parte the spoile. Have two, of heavenly issue both, throwne downe One simple woman? O! a famows foile. Art a beleving lady, vnadvised, By Cupid conquer'd, and thy slight supprised? “Oh poore weak conquest! But to what effect Thus keep we armes? Why peace and amity Prefer we not, though earst we did suspect Owr prowd skie-reaching wals of Carthage hie? Those feares remov'd, now at thine owne desire, Thow hast what heart can wish or tongue require. “Love-sick Eliza now thy boy doth burne. The furiows forge Æneas feeds alone. O! let vs then conjoine, withowt returne, With equall love vniting both in one. Now Dido may be tyed to Trojane mate, And thow receave, in tougher, Carthage great.” But Venus soone the stinging snake espied, Hid in the grasse, quick in her guilded wordes, And counterfeet the Siren's song she tried; To whome the Goddes answere thus affordes, (Perceiving that of policy she spak From Italy Æneas to keip back.) “Who war so mad, with the in armes contend, Refuse thy freindship, or thy sutes denie? If fates owr projects happily would end! But O, I feare, when Jove owr minds doth trie, If he will graunt this purpose to approve, And if assent those partyes joine in love. “Thow art his spowse, thow boldly may assay To learne [his] will; lead thow the way I followe.” “That parte,” (quoth shee), “pertaines to me to play, That fuird, though fear'd, I hope to find but shallowe. But how the present purpose finish may, Give eare, and shortly I sall showe the way. “Soone as Aurora frome her bed of roses, Arising chearfully, beginnes to blush; And, in the East, heavens cristall gate vncloses, From whence big-looking Phaeton doth rush With flaming haire; then are those lovers two A hunting in the woddes resolv'd to goe. “There, whil the horsemen, prancing to and fro, Enclose abowt with hounds the trembling deir, I, frome above, a tempest downe shall thro', A fearfull storme, till all their troupes reteir. With thund'ring noyse both heaven and earth sall shake, Perforce the hunters shall the fields forsake. “Their mates, butt more, shall all at once be gone; None shall abide, but all in darknes stray; With sable wings night shall envolve anone The world each where: all shall in darknes stray. One cave shall then, (butt witnes more), containe The Trojane prince and Carthaginiane queene. “Where, if thow firmely to my minde accord, I shall be present, and with mutuall vowes Mak her his wife, and him her mate and lord, In all respects to vse her as his spouse; Both tying with vnseparable bands, In Hymen's presence joining hearts and hands.” The Goddes showing by a gracefull smile, That she applauded vnto Junoes minde, Begowth to laugh when shee perceiv'd the guile, And gave a signe in token she enclin'd, And to the purpose did assent, and so, Whil they devise, the night away doth go. Aurora blushing then at once appeares. The gallant ?owthes for pastime all prepare, With nets of ev'ry sorte, with hunting speares; The horsemen haste with hounds, of sent most rare. Before the palace all the cowrt attends The Queen's aryvall, whil the morning spends. With gold attir'd, and robes of costly worth, Threat'ning the bitt, her palfrey stamping stayed. With mighty traine herself then marches foorth, With broid'red mantle, hunter-like arrayed. Of gold her quaver, gold her loks divids, And purple garment, tied with gold, abides. Lo! now, the prince Ascanius proceeds, Accompany'd with all the Trojane peers. Æneas last majestickly succeeds, Whose brave proportion all, butt match, admires. With stately cariage, marching forward fast, Till with the Queen his troupes he joines at last. Most like Apollo, shuneing winters stormes, When Zanthus' floods, and Lycia's cold he flyes, And to his native soile himself conformes, To Delos, there to feast and sacrifize. For gladenes all th' inhabitants do shout, Dancing with joy the altars round about. On Cynthus' toppes the God doth proudly space, With hov'ring locks, which drest in circling rownds, With Lawrell garlandes, and with golden lace, Are touss'd; his shafts betwix his shoulders sounds. So march't the stately Trojane; such his grace, Such was the beauty of his heavinly face. How soone the' aryv'd upon the montaines hie, And found the haunts where as the beasts had stayed; Behold! the deir downe from the rocks do flie, Coursing abroad, athort the fields affrayed. Both heards of Hart and Hinde the hills forgoe, And in one globe with feet the dust vpthroe. But in the vaile Ascanius doth abide, Making his steid his ?owthfull rider feele; And now doth one, now others over-ride, With dastard beasts disdaining more to deele, But earnestly wisheth for some foamie boare, Or that ane ramping lyon once would roare. Heaven's ordinance with this the earth do threat, With noyse and terrour; fire and lightnings flie; Of raine and rageing wind a tempest great, With horride darknes, dimme the worlds bright eye; Fire, water, air, and earth seame all anone, With hiddeows tumult, intermixt in one. Not trees alone but solide rocks do shake, Assail'd by rageing torrents tumbling downe Frome toppes of steipest montaines: all forsake The fields, affrayed in every rill to drowne. Their troupes, divided, search themselves to shroud Frome furiows heavins, with thunders roaring lowd. One cave, whil all the tempest dark do shield, The Trojane Duke and Dido both contained. Prodigiows presages sad earth did ?eeld, With them when Juno in the cave convein'd. The guilty air gave light; the fire did glance; And montaine Faryes did bewaile the chance. Looke! how a Comet, whose bright flamming haire Brings tidings sad of dearth, or death of kings, Drawes all men's eyes to gaze amidst the aire, Conjecturing thereby of future things; So, whil at first, the Princes beauty shin'd, Æneas wond'ring ravish't was in minde. Her pure vnborrowed blush, her native white, The piercing rayes of her victoriows eyes, Bred in his soule such singulare delight, And did his senses suddainely supprise, In such a sort, that of all sense denude, He long a lifles, senseles statue stoode. But soone her looks, of pow'r t'awaken death, And ravish with amazement hardest hearts, Reviv'd him frome his traunse, recal'd his breath, And to his sleeping senses life empartes; Who instantly confines, within his armes, His sweetest Siren, who his fancie charmes. Sie now how honour, love, and modesty, With diverse colours dye her blushing cheeks! When, (lay'd aside respect of majesty), The fort to render, proud Æneas seeks. And whil, (desire rul'd by the blinded boy,) Loves sweet-stolne sport he labours to enjoy. With faint repulses and denialls sweet, Lo! how she shrinking, strives his sutes to shune; But he now offers force, now doth entreate, And still persewes, till last the prise is wonne. The jemme enjoy'd, which women hold so deare, And honour prostrate, blushing did reteare. Can words, can vowes, can feeble hands resist, With hote desire whil ?owthfull blood doth boyle? Though she repine, do his assaults desist? Small glory is a ?eelded foe to foyle. Women must still deny and vse defences, Till charming Cupid lull a sleep the senses. This wrought to sin, anone she waxeth bold, And mutually her mate doth entertaine; Loe! how her strict embraces him enfold, Whil as they issue frome the cave againe, Nothing asham'd to come in open sight, Thus vse in sinning soone maks sin seame light. This disemall day did Didoes death begin; This day of all her sorrowes was the source: Now neither fame she cares, nor shame, nor sin, Nor more devises any secrete cowrse To cloake her love; but mariage this she thinks, And at this foule offence, (effronted), winks. Swift-flying fame those tydings quickly spreads, And suddaine rumours soone through Africk sends. Fame, which by flight and moving lives &amp; breads, Lurks first belowe, then straight to hevin ascends. With nimble wings from earth she doth arise, And hides her head amidst the starry skies. Her mother earth, (whil as her brood rebelld Against the gods, with blind ambition driven, Themselves ov'rthrowne, their proud designes repell'd, Darring to scale the batlements of heaven), Her brooded foorth, (they say), in great despight, A sister light of foot, and swift of flight. A fearfull monster, horrible butt match; How many wav'ring plumes her carcasse beares, Als many eyes them vnderneath do watch; (A wondrous thing to showe), als many eares Still heark both near and far, throughowt all bounds; Als many mowthes; als many tongues resounds. Twixt heaven and earth, by night she nimbly flyes. Her brazen trumpe to sownd she sleep forsakes. Great cittyes oft by day she terrifyes. On turrets hie she sitts, when rest she takes. And whil she showes what she hath seene by viewe, Things ofter fain'd she doth reporte then true. Then diverse rumours she disperst anone, Blazing abroad both things vndone and done. How to Æneas, of the Trojanes one, The matchles Dido dain'd her self to joine, Who given to please the flesh, (a life vnjust), Care-les of kingdomes, live in lawles lust. With those reportes whil she the world did fill, To loath'd Hiarbas now she taks her flight, And showes this lover even the worst of ill,— How, he disdain'd, a stranger joyes his right. This king was Joves owne sone, and child most deare, Whome Garamanth the noble nymph did beare. An hundreth temples in his large empire, An hundreth altars are to Jove vpraised, Where he hath consecrate a quencheles fire, Where, night and day, th' eternall gods are praised. The blood of bullocks cover all the grounde; Sweit smelling floures through all the flures are founde. He, mad almost in minde, depriv'd of rest, Sore griev'd and with those bitter newes displeased, Himself in presence of the gods addrest, And their before the altars sacrifized. With humble heart, and hie erected hands, Thus powring foorth his plaints to Jove he stands: “Æternall Jove! whom Lybianes all adore, As heaven's most gloriows guide and judge supreme, On carpetts ritch, to thy immortall glore Solemnely feasting, celebrate thy name. Beholdst thow this, O father most benigne! Of heaven and earth the sempiternall king. “Though, frome above, thow fire-flaughts downe dost throwe, (Dread soveraigne!) ?it we nothing are affrayed; Though by thy lightnings we thy wraith do knowe, ?it not-the-les owr wickednes is stayed; As lacking force, thy fires no fear affords, And judgements past no mortall more records. “A woman, wand'ring in owr coastes of late, To whome, both towne and bounds where she remain'd I gave, with lawes to governe her estate, My mariage most vngrately hath disdain'd, And plac'd a stranger over her empires, As only Sov'raigne of her soules desires. “And now he, Paris-like, with mates disguised, Half-men, half-maids, resembling both or neither, His curled head with Phrygian mytre guised, With balmed haires, his spoyles enjoyes the rather. But we, befoire thine altares gifts do heape, And nothing els but fruteles fame do reape.” Him playning thus, with melancholiows minde, The Thund'rer heard, and turning straight his eyes To Carthage cowrt, (whose stately turrets shin'd 'Gainst Phœbus' rayes), where he those lovers sees, Drunk with delight of sin, not careing shame, Whole given to lust and misregarding fame: “Go, Mercury, my sone, mak haste,” he sayes, “And with Æolian wings addresse thy flight To Carthage, where the Trojane chiftane stayes, And kingdomes given by Fate regardes so light. Go swiftly sliding through the subtle aire, My vncontrolled will to him declare. “None such fair Venus promeist he shuld prove, Nor twise for this from Graecian armes reskued; But one to daunt sterne Mars, not doate in love, Ov'r Italy to reigne, by him subdued. To kythe his courage frome his noble race, And mak the world each where his lawes embrace. “If no desire of glore can raise his spright, Nor loves for praise to putt himself to paine, Should he Ascanius frustrate of his right? Amidst his foes what meanes he to remaine? Nor looks what justly to his ayres doth fall? To sea he must! this is the summe of all!” This said: the God hence, (swift as thought), he flew, With nimble feathers to the winds displayed; Divides the cristall sphears and circles blew, And cutts the clouds, with golden wings arrayed. The mover first, the light and shyning fire He leaves, descending frome great Jove's empire. The Ramme, the bull, the Twinnes he passeth nixt, With all the signes the Zodiak adorne. Owtrunnes the cowrse of straying starres and fixt, Of planets, which the rest in beauty scorne, And glist'ring bright, each in a golden robe, With gloriows lustre, grace heaven's azure globe. Now by the Artick Pole he swiftly slides, Owtflyes the eagle and the silver swan, The flamming dragon, which the Beirs divides, The Dolphin ravish't with delight of man, The croune and speare, with many many a million Of lamps, which light this spatiows pavillion. This climate cold, where haill, where frost and snowe, Where raine and thunders, heat and cold do strive, He leaves als swift as shaft from archers bowe, And in a sweitter soyle doth soone arive, Where as the Hydra, and the hirpling Hare, As mates, in the Antartick Pole repare. A rod he bears, by which he calls againe, And sends downe soules to Plutoes dark empires; Both giveth sleep, and sleeping doth restraine, Lenthes and abridges life, as he desires. Still thus he flyes, till he discerne the tops Of Atlas hudge, the Pole which vnderprops,— Of aged Atlas, whose pyn-bearing browes, With sable clouds encompast all abowt, Nor haile, nor sleet, nor wind, nor weit eschewes; Adoune his shoulders raging spates do spowt; Whose wrinkled chin great floods do overflowe, And hiddeows beard maide stiff with frost and snowe. Heir first his flight heaven's nimble herauld stayes; Hence posts with speed, his cowrse through th' ocean plying, And as the swiftest bird, a thowsand wayes, Now soaring hie, now low her feathers trying, Alongst the coast of Africk still he flyes, Till stately Carthage now at lenth he sees. Heir whil he first with winged feet did light, And touch't the turrets of those buildings rare, Anone Æneas he perceaves in sight, Raising ritch monuments amidst the aire, To building bent, begirt with sword most bright With jasper stones, which, starrified, gave light. With Tyrian purpour robe arayed he shin'd, Hung frome his shoulders, gloriows to behold, Which gifts the noble Dido had propin'd, Wov'ne by her self, and warpt with twist of gold. No sooner him thus busied he beholds, But instantly his message sad vnfolds. “Thow most effeminatly who dost found, And, (far from hence), heir sumptuous buildings reares, Skie-reaching castells raising from the ground, Vnmindfull of thy kingdome and effaires; To the I come, to the, frome heavens above, The winged herauld of great thund'ring Jove. “Hee hath given charge I should imparte his minde. What meanst thow heir in Africk to remaine? To conquere glory if thow be not inclin'd, Nor loves for praise to put thy self to paine, Ascanius rising ?it behold, and wey The hope of ayers from him by just degrie, “To which the crowne of Italy is due, To which the Romane empire appertaines. To sea thow must!” Thus said, he bids adieue, And visible no more at all remaines To mortall sight: as Phœbus beames do banish A sable cloud, so did the god evanish. But now, sad Prince, what stand'st thow thus amazed? What passions the perplexe? why lookst thow pale? What suddaine sorrowes on thy soule have seazed? What froward fate hath turn'd thy blesse to baill? What woes so vive, charact'red in thy face, Thus overcloud the rayes of princely grace? As one whome fearfull visions do affright, In nature's dear embraces laid a sleep, Whil Hydras and Chymeras mock the sight, And wound the soule with apprehensions deep, Whil as this masse, wherein nought moves but breath, Oft starts, whil gastly Gorgones threatne death; So still he stands, nor voyce nor gesture steirs, With armes acrosse; his colour comes and goes; Words find no vent; confus'd with suddaine feares, His haires for horrour and affright vprose. Sad, pale, astonisht, and of sense bereft He seem'd; this sight such deep impression left. But, self-return'd, he layes aside respect Of things humane to Jove's eternall will. He must not follow what he doth affect. What heavens command poore mortalls must fulfill. Now must he leave his princesse and her state. Who may resist inevitable Fate? But ah! (sad soule), what shall he first attempt? How dar he this his enterprise reveale To furiows Dido? how her minde relent? What way with her dar he begin to deale? Resolving now, now changing, nought contents, In diverse partes his dowbtsome minde he rents. At last his captaines he concludes to call, (As only best advise to be embrac'd), Sergestus, Mnestheus, and Cloanthus tall; Straight gives command their fleet to rig in haist, And by their counsell, providence, and care, For flight by sea doth privily prepare. Their souldiers they do secretly conveene, In readines remaining on the shoare, In shining armes who suddainly ar seene For feare of any following vproare, And cawses fain'd, to keip their plots vnkend, Of such novationes publickly pretend. He meanwhile minds, whil Dido least doth knowe, And doubts no breach of such sure founded love, To try her pleasant hours most fitt to showe, And search if he her owne consent could move. Their prince's pleasure they, butt more delay, Haste all anone with glaidnes to obey. But watchfull Dido did the guile perceive, And fand the cowrse intended for their flight, (What slight so great a lover can deceive? What fetch of fyne device could syle her sight?) Then foorthwith fame disperst for newes abroade, In readines their ships at anchore roade. She, mov'd in minde, with looks and gesture sad, With hiddeows clamoure railes the streets through owt, Most like the furiows Thyas running mad, The fearfull leader of that rageing rowt; Whil as the Moenads, who abhorre the light, Do sacrifize to Bacchus in the night. With boundles rage, thus overrul'd a space, Anger and furie in her face did flame; Mad passions did her patience displace, Despight and rancour reason overcame; Wraith keipt in words, sighs only passage finde, Whose vapours vented, ease her burden'd minde. At last, more calme, she thus begowth to speak, (Extremity to words a way affords:) “Dost thow intend, deir lord,” (quoth she), “to break Thy solemne vowes, and violate thy words? Thy sad departure frome thy love to hyd, And frome thir shoares thus secretly to slyde? “Whither, O cruell! whither dost thow flie? What discontent thus change in the doth move? What wrong, (alas!), or what offence in me, Thus maks the loath and vilipend my love? With too much kindnes art thow overcloyed? Or ar my favowrs hated, 'cawse enjoyed? “Ah! 'twas not so, when thow did pensive sit, Sigh, faine to die, look pale, protest, and sweare, Vowing thy service at my feet, whil ?it For all thy oathes thy policies appear. By sad experience, O! I find it true, That seldome lust delights in what is due. “But ?it the world in me some fault may deeme, (For poore, weak women euer bear the blame), Why thow my bed, as stayn'd, dost disesteeme, Regardles of my favour, thy defame. But I to the appeal, if ere my ?owth Gave proofe of ought butt vndistained trewth. “Did my cold breast so long vnwarm't remaine From men's deceits, and charming flatterings free, Nor once one thought of love did intertaine, Cruell to all, but kinde alone to the? Keipt I so long my marble minde vnshaken, To be by the disdain'd, and thus forsaken? “Stay ?it, O! stay, my Deir, possesse in peace The jewell, which of laite so dear thow prised; And be not author of her sad disgrace, Who cannot breath and be by the despised. Returne, Deir Lord, leave not thy halfe behind, What I entreate with tears thy oathes do bind. “Oh! hast thow ells forgot, (when in the cave Thy guilded words and vowes first won the field; When, to thy sutes, consent my silence gave, And poore beleving I, myself did ?eild.) How thow did swear, resolve, protest and vow, Still to be hers, whom thow disdainest now? “How can I think those sighs, so feeling, fained? Those passionat regrates, but arm'd with airt? Those looks, so sad, but for the fashion fraimed To melt with pitty my relenting heart? Whil thow beneath thy passions seam'd to faint, And thowsand colours thy pale cheiks did paint. “Those sighs, regrates, lookes, passions, colours strange, Though faynd, in me produc't no false effects. By those betray'd, I from myself did range, Too prodigall of what thow now neglects; And headlesly to thy desires consenting; Whilk breeds in the dislike, in me lamenting. “If thow object thy love was then entire, What owtward virtues now in me do want? Do not thir beautyes even the same appeare, That did attract thine heart of adamant? No stolne vermilion blush, to charme delight With false allurements, did bewitch thy sight. “That bastard beauty, and adultrate dye, That new-found falshood, conterfoot of nature, Shame of owr sexe, the stayne of modesty, Fewell to lust, to chastity a traitoure, That mystery to me was still vnknowne, This red and white was then, as now, mine owne. “Though loathed beauty lack perswading force, Now overclouded with afflictions vaile; Though sutes, nor sighes find pitty nor remorce; Though passions, plaints, and prayers nought prevaile; And though thir eyes' bright sunne, obscur'd with smarte, Lack piercing rayes to penetrate thy heart; “?it cannot my affection nor thy faith, My constant love, thy promise and right hand, Nor thine owne Didoes miserable death;— Can none of those deteine the in this land? But ah! whil winter's stormes thus raigeing be, Wilt thow endanger both thy self and me? “Wilt thow, O cruell thow, to saile mak haste, Whil boystrows Boreas threats the swelling seas? Suppone, though Troy ?it vndestroy'd did last, And to no forraine countrey now thow flyes, Whil furiows neptune rageing doth remaine, Thy native Troy should thow by shipping gaine? “Ah! fleest thow me? ?it by those streaming teares, Which leaue affliction's furrowes on my face; By thy right hand, by all the hopes and feares Possesse poore lovers, by those oathes, alace! Which me betrayed, by owr espousall day, And by that love thow bar'st me once, I pray, “If ever I of the did well deserve, To the ought dear if ever Dido gave, Showe now compassion; firme thy faith observe; My life and croune from death and ruine save. O! let my prayers ?it relent thy minde, If any place with the my sutes may finde. “For thee, the Lybian Kings conspire my wrack; For thee, the hatred of mine owne I beare; For thee alone, my shamefast lyf I brack, And Fame I lost, to me nor life more deare. To whom thus leavest thow me, to die with shame, O ghuest? I dar no more the husband name. “Ah! loathed Dido, must thow live to sie Thy foes triumph? thy self detained a slave? ?it, if at least before thy flight from me, My luck had been succession sweet to have; If any small Æneas heir did play Within this hall, thy face who might bewray, “Those sorrowes then I should not shrink to prove, Nor vtterly forsaken should I seeme.” Thus clos'd she weeping, but no words culd move His marble minde, he doth so much esteime The Thund'rer's will. With stedfast eyes he stair'd, And, obstinate, for answere thus prepar'd: “Deir Queen! (quoth he), I never shall deny Thy favowres far surmount my meane deserts. Thy beauty's bountys, and thy loyaltie, Would ravish with remorce the hardest hearts. Nor shall I euer cease, (till heavens afford My life's last gaspe), thy kindnes to record. “Those dear delights which I enjoyed of the No tract of time shall frome my minde remove. Dear shall thy memory be still to me; Dear the remembrance of Eliza's love; And, where so e're remov'd, thow may by right Esteime me still thy souldier and thy knight. “But to the purpose briefly I replie: As to this end I never heir arived Myself in Hymen's sacred bands to tie, To be of dearest liberty deprived. So, butt thy knowledge, neither did I minde To steale from hence, for?etfull, and vnkinde. “If heavens and Fortune did assent that I My life, according to my minde, shuld lead, Demolish't Troy in dust no more should lie, And Priam's tow'rs should ?it amazement bread. Those hands my native city should restore, And raise anone to all her former glore. “To Itally, but now Apollo great, To Itally the dest'nyes me command. Their my delight, my countrey, mine estate. How canst thow my departure thus withstand? As thow a stranger dost in Africk stay, Why may not I to Italy mak way? “How oft dark night with shadowes overcasts Earth's low'ring face, and glist'ring starres arise; Anchises' ghost als oft my soule agasts With fearfull visions to my sleeping eyes; Admonishing, with terrour and affright, Me to forgoe thy soyle and deirest sight. “Ascanius als, whom I vnjustly wrong, By dreames appeareth frustrate of his right, Keipt from the croune of Itally so long, And fatall bounds; both those steir vp my flight. And now wing'd Hermes, sent from Jove to me, Commands from hence that I in haste should flie. “Myself the God within the walls appeare (Whil as dayes bright beames wer shining) did perceive; His heavenly voyce thir humane ears did heare. Leaue then, (I pray), dear Queen, those things to crave, As may steir vp both the and me to woe. To Italy against my will I goe.” Him speaking thus, she, sore perplext in minde, (With greiff in heart and sorrow in her face, Rolling each where her eyes with lookes vnkinde, As in amazement), did behold a space. Not able more her passion to suppresse, Those bitter words, at last, she doth expresse: “Remorceles traitour, whom I held too deare! Sprung from no parents, but of brutish kinde, The Paphyen Queen such brood did never beare, Nor the Anchises gott, O wretch vnkinde! But of the hoarse sea wavs, and hardest stane, Nurst by some Tigresse, thow hast essence taine. “Why do I longer my designes disguise? For what things more should I myself reserve? Oh! how he did my wofull plaints despise, And stood vnmov'd, whill I for greiff did swarve. All my regrates and tears, powr'd foorth in vaine, From his hard breast one sigh could never straine. “Ay me! what shall I first lament (alace)? Ay me! where shall my tragoedy begin? Let heauens behold my sad afflicted cace, The grievs and woes I am envolved in. Let mighty Jove, let Juno from above, Look on my wrongs and ill-rewarded love. “?e happy maids, in fredome who enjoy The dear delights of sacred chastity, Free from the slee deceits of Venus' boy, Secure frome danger of disloyalty; Who never ?it have knowne men's perjuries, Nor stand in neid of Argus' hundreth eyes; “O ?e, who, (Phœnix like), do live but one; Whose vertew's streame vntrubled still runnes pure; Frie birds, whom never hand hath seaz't vpon, From fouler's whisle and deceits secure; Frie from love's plague and perillows infection, Nor wonne by men, nor vassaills to affection; “O never, never to the oaths giue eare, Nor truste that impiows and vnfaithfull race, Who ne're to vs do what they are appeare, (Perniciows instruments of owr disgrace); And whatsomever showe they do pretend, Nought but owr shame and infamy intend. “Their vows, their prayers, protestations, teares, Are all but fain'd to breid in vs compassion. None minds his oaths, nor meanes the thing he sweares, ?it cunningly can co?terfitt a passion. Owr tender hearts with pitty which betraying, Works their advantage, and owr sure decaying. “O then, how of owr favours kinde they boast, And overcloud with black reproach owr fame! Thus are owr fortunes mar'd, owr honours lost, By those who ar delighted in owr shame. Let Dido's sad experience serve to prove Their is no trewth in men, nor trust in love. “No trust in love, nor trewth in men remaines. This wretch whom seas had naked cast on shoare, I, (foolish I), prefer'd, who now disdaines My self, my scepter, and will stay no more; Vnmindfull miser whom I did receive, And plac'd, as Lord, ov'r me and all I have. “What furys thus (alace!), incense my breast? Apollo now! now Oracles Divine! Now heaven's great messenger is thus impesht! Quhat ells? Now thund'ring Jove doth thus encline, And hath his winged herauld sent to vs! It's like enough the gods ar busied thus! “A deep invention, forg'd by fine deceit, I neither hold it's trew, nor false repells. Go, cruell, go! to Italy, ingrate! Go, traitour! where thy dest'nies the compells. Go with such joy, such comfort, peace, and rest, As now thow leaves in my afflicted breast. “I hope, in midst of furiows rageing seas, (If heavens with equity behold my wrongs), Vengeance on the, in presence of thir eyes, For thy deserts, shall fall, the rocks amongs, Where Dido, whom thow oft by name shall call, With brands of fire thy conscience shall apall. “And when death's inevitable decree My body from my better halfe shall parte, My angry ghost, till I avenged be, Shall the persew each where with armes and airt, Nor earth's lowe centre, neither heaven nor hell, Shall shield the frome my spight and fury fell.” Ov'rcome with passion, she no more could speak, But, preassing to eschew his hatefull sight, Excesse of greiff her purpose heir did break, (Her latest words scarce heard, nor vtt'red right). Her vitall powers did faill, her life did faint, And death his image in her face did paint. Thus, sleeping in a traunce, his eyes she fled, And left him, (wofull wight), himself alone, Full many things prepareing to have said, And maid reply. With that her maids anone, With ruefull cryes, her frozen corps do bear, And her in bed they lay with duilfull chear. But now Æneas, though he much enclined, (Ov'rcome with greiff, and wounded with remorce), T' have calm'd the tempest of her troubled minde With chearfull words, touch't with affection's force; Whil as the tears, which from his eyes did slide, If seene by her, her rage had mollifi'd; Afflicted soule! what shall he now resolve? To heavens and her his duety how discharge? A labyrinth of dowbts doth him envolve; Pitty withstood what Jove did strictly charge; Constraint him led at lenth, with ruefull look, Loe! how of her, his last farewell he took. Hard hearted lover to thy loyall love! Could not the sunne-set of those lovely eyes, (Whil death her senses stopt), to pitty move Thy flinty heart? O! so to tyrannize Ov'r conquer'd beauty, to thy fame adds soyle: The victor seldome leaves behind his spoyle. Now Trojanes all with earnestnes endevore Their fleet to loose, and launch into the deepe: Ships, hulks, and galleyes slide along the shore, And frome the haven with pitched keills do creep. Trees ?it vnshapen, blooming leawes for haste, And oakes ?it floorishing for oares they plac't. Them, swarming frome the portes, ?ow might have spyed, All rushing headlongs, hasting from the towne; As emmets, whil for winter they provide, Disperst abroad, each running vp and downe, An heap of corne do spoyle, and beare away To those hid dennes where they intend to stay. Those little troupes marche through the fields butt feare, And through darne passages their spoyles convoy; The greatest graine on shoulders some do beare, With all his might each doth himself employ. With earnest repare the paths do seeme to sweate: So ran the Trojanes to launch foorth their fleate. What minde, (alace!) then Dido, was to the? What sense of sorrow? what vnkindly care? What deep-drawne sighs? when thow, (sad soule), didst see, (Wak't from thy traunce), such tumult every where. When all the Ocean seem'd, frome shore to shore, With thund'ring noyse into thine eares to rore. O love! thow tyrant love! what humane wight Feeles not the force of thy vnbounded ire? What breathing creature may resist thy might? Thy fierce assaults, thy bowe, thy shafts, thy fire? What dost thow not poor mortall's force to trie, Subjected once vnto thy tyranny? Now is she forc't, who late triumph't ov'r love, Againe to treat, againe to turne to teares; A poore petitioner constrain't to prove, An humble supplicant to closed eares; And least, vntried, she ought had overpast, Thus she resolv's to try him ?it at last. “O! Anna! Anna! siest thow now what haste Those impiows traitours mak from hence to saile? And leaue me loath'd, forsaken, and disgrac't, Whome death and infamy alike assaile. Loe! where their fleet, an happy gayle to finde, Doth ly at anchor, waiting on the winde. “If ever such an ocean of annoyes, A waste abysse, a boundles gulf of greiff, I could have fear'd should thus have drown'd my joyes, Those feares afforded might haue my releiff. But, (sister), ?it before my tragick fate, Go, charg't with teares, this last requeest entreate. “For, faithles, he to the alone gaue eare, To the alone his minde he would reveale; Thow knows his graciows howres, O sister deare; Thow knows his times, most fitt with him to deale. Go! I entreat, to my disdainfull foe, And those few words from his poore Dido shoe. “'Gainst him with Graecians I did not conspire, Nor vow'd at Aulis ancient Troyes disgrace; Nor sent I navies, armed with sword and fire, To sack his citty, or extirpe his race. Anchises' ghost, inter'd, I did not teare. Why, why refuses he my words to hear? “Where hastes he headlongs? whither doth he move? Nought ells I crave, (O! let him now obey This last request of me his dying love), Before his flight let heavens their fury lay, O! let him stay whil Æol's rage doth last, Till Thetys calme, till perill first be past. “Rejected Hymen, now I crave no more, Nor sues he should forgoe his mindes delight. Showe him nought ells his Dido doth emplore, But let him choose a time more fitt for flight. A pause to slack my fury I beseach, My state to mourne, till me my fortune teach. “This latest fauour, this my last desire, I humbly plead; pitty thy sister's state, And when thow hast obtain'd what I require, To all my greiffs death shall afforde a date.” Thus she entreats, thus Anna weeping goes, And thus with teares Æneas' answere sho'es. But he, (most cruell tyger), stops his eares, No pitty can prevale to plead remorce; Sighs are despised, no place is found for teares, Her sutes vnheard, her prayers have no force. Fates do withstand, great Jove his eares hath charmed, And heavens him with an hard'ned heart have armed. Most like an ancient oake or statly pine, Which rageing winds impetuously assaile, And threat the trembling tree to vndermine, On each side striving her from earth t' vphaile, With hiddeows noyse which reeling to and froe, Now heir now their, still seames to overbloe. Her branches beatne by the storme resound, Her heaven-bent bewes must either bow or break, Her straughtest tops are forc't the earth to wound, But ?it how much they do themselfs ereck To heavens; als much her rootes reach downe belowe, And grips the rocks; no storme can her ov'rthrowe. Even so, Æneas, now for flight prepar'd, With tears and prayers on each side assail'd, Though long his minde confus'd with dowbts appear'd, ?it neither pitty, plaints, nor words avail'd; He stedfast stands, sighes can no favour gaine; Torrents of teares ar powred foorth in vaine. THE THIRD BOOKE, CONTAINING ÆNEAS DEPARTURE AND DIDOES TRAGAEDY, &amp;c. Now woefull Dido, sad afflicted wight, Greiv'd with the Fates' vnflexible decree, Her heavy soull abhorres the loathed light, Charg't with affliction and anxietie. Heaven's cristall vaults she wearyes more to view, Resolv't at once to bid the world adiewe. Whil as on altars she did incense burne, It seem't she saw, (a monstrows sight to showe), The liquours black, the wyne in blood to turne, Presaging her approaching overthrowe. To none this fearfull vision she reveal'd, ?ea, even from Anne, she this sight conceal'd. Ane chappell als was in the palace plac'd, Where humbly heavens Sicheus earst ador'd, Whose marble walls rare artifice had grac'd, With sacred bewes, and fleeces white decor'd.— From thence, (whill night earth's face did overcloud), It seem'd Sicheus call'd her name aloud. And als the light-envying owle, alone, With tragick toones her smarte and sorrow shew, With mourning accents seiming to bemone, As if she knew some bad mischaunce t' ensue; Then diverse things, which prophets shew of old, Her mangled minde with monstrows visions hold. Her oft, by dreames, Æneas fierce doth chace, Still seaming to be left herself alone, And vagabounding in ane heavy cace Through fields vnknowne, accompanyed by none, Searching her people, but she none can finde, A tediows journey to her wearyed minde: As Pentheus mad, affray't by furyes, seam't Two Sunnes, two Thebes, both at once to see; Or as Orestes in his fancy dream't His hydra-headed mother he did flie, Arm'd all with snakes, and brands of burning fire, Each place seam't plenisht with revenge and ire. In guilty conscience having now decreed, No salue butt death could cure her inward sore, And with her self on time and forme aggreed, (Loathing the world, resolv't to liue no more), This fain'd device, suspicion till eschew, Of her designes she to her sister shew. (Her thoughts disguising with a smiling face, And hope appearing in her eyes to shine): “O Anna, now rejoyce thy sister's cace, For I an way have found by rare engine, Which him with me to stay shall either move, Or teach me to reclaime from him my love. “A land theire is, far, far remote from hence, Which sees the sonne go downe in westerne deeps; Whose coastes abowt the Ocean doth fence; Of Æthiopia the name it keeps; Where Atlas hudge on shoulders strong doth beare, And vnderprops heaven's star-embroidred spheare. “A virgin preist by chance of Morish lyne, Expert in magick, hath from thence repair'd, Who keeps the garden of th' Hesperian tryne, And feeds the dragon which the frute doth guarde; Mixing with honey, and with liquours sweet, The purple poppy which provoketh sleep. “She, by her charmes, can stop affection's source, And whom she pleases, als can plague with love; Torrents ar stayed; stars retrograde their cowrse; Spreits from belowe do at her word remove; Dull earth doth roare, and horribly resound, And tallest trees do headlongs fall to ground. “Let heavens and the, deir sister! bear recorde, And witnes to the world, against my will, That I, constrain'd, to magick airts accorde, And seeks redresse by such vnlawfull skill. Go thow, ereck in th' inner cowrt in haste A fire of wod, vpon the walls hie plac'd. “Tak syne the sword leaft by this perjur'd wretch, His cloaths, and als owr haples wedding-bed, In which I perisht whil I fear'd no bretch; And let those all vpon the flame be laid, So that no token vndestroyed may stand Which him pertain'd. Thus doth the priest c?and.” Heir clois'd she, sighing sore, perplext a space To stop the currant of her swelling teares; The crimson dy abandoning her face, Sad, faint, and pale, she look't, confus't with feares. ?it Anna doubts not that she doth intend Thus to disguise her death, and cloak her end. No rage so great, no fury so extreame, She dreids her sister in her thoughts conceav'd; Nor feares now ought more fearfull till haue seene, Nor when Sicheus was of life bereav'd. Wherefore in haste, she, (simple soull), obeyes, And, to performe her charge, no more delayes. Ane heap of wod for fire prepair'd at once, With garlands deckt, and crownd with Cypres bewes. The Queen her sad misfortunes first bemones, And with her teares his portrate she bedewes. Syne with the bed, sword, cloathes, she layes ye same Vpon the heap, to perish in the flame. In circles rownd, the altars stand abowt; The Priest appearing then with hov'ring haire, With thund'ring noyse, three hundreth times doth showt On Fiends and Pharyes thither to repare; Conjuring by some charme or magick spell, The fowle three headed Hecate from hell. Then sprinkling waters of the Stygian fount, They search by night some sucking foale to finde, And pull the hippom'nes from his tender front, The mother's minde which to the brood doth binde. Collecting als, their damned work to speed, The milkie poyson of each ven'mowse weed. The Queen herself before the altars stands, With one foot bair, her garment loosse vntied, With humble heart, and heaven-erected hands, Calling to witnes, (now before she dyed), Her guilty starres, and all the gods above, Of both their partes,—his perjury, her love. If any pow'r supreme then heavens containe, Or godhead which such lovers doth regarde, As loves sweit ?ock, and sympathie, do stayne, And true affection with disdaine regarde, With fervent minde, fixing her eyes above, To such she prayes, mindfull and just to prove. With mantle dark night now did earth ovrspreed, Each living soull death's image pale possest. The savage citi?ens, which life did leed In wods and waters, all secure did rest. Whil as the heavenly torches, burning bright, The equall half had wasted of their light. The skailly squadrones of the liquid lakes, The brutish bands which in the deserts dwell, Easing their wearyed mindes, sweet slumber takes, Cares past entombeing in oblivion's cell. But not so Dido: neither sleep nor ease Vpon her self-consuming minde can sease. Her cares increase, her sorrowes never sleep; No night her eyes, no rest her thoughts obtaine; Despight, wraith, furie,—each his place doth keip; No paussing-space her troubled spreit doth gaine. But now, inflamed, she burnes in furiows fire, Now foorth with free?eth in revenge and ire. “Ah! shall I ?it assay, (quoth she), to speak My scornefull victor, proud of my disgrace? Shall I with shame my former suters seeke? There sew for favour, there entreat for grace Where pitty pleaded, I so oft disdain'd? Where mercy beg'd, I ruethles still remain'd? “Or shall I follow that ingloriows fleet, Fraughted with falshood, guile, and perjuryes? As if thy former favours now shuld meet My discontents, and sad afflictions ease. O ?es! performed pleasures, kindnes past, In gratefull mindes lay'd vp so long doth last. “Suppone such thoughts to practise I would prove, Should any second my desires? alace! Who would regarde so much my loathed love, As daigne their stips to render me a place? Forsaken soule, too late thow dost repent, Thow knew Laomedon's perjur'd discent. “Shall I, alone, my bragging foes persewe, Or raise my people to revenge and waste? And so endanger by the seas anew, Those, present perill who have scarce ov'rpast? Fy! Dye thyself! such is thy due desert; Once let this sword put period to thy smarte. “Thow, sister, first, thow, by my teares betrayed, Didst overloade me with this masse of care; Thow to my foe captiv'd me vnaffrayed; Thow to mine en'mie mad'st me ?eeld butt feare. Ah! might I not have happy liv'd alone, And never more the cares of wedlock knowne? “I needed not thus waste in teares my ?owth, With love's misfortunes and afflictions crost, If I had keept inviolate my trueth To my Sicheus, dear departed ghost.” Those sad regrates, with all the wofull words A troubled soull could ?eeld, she thus affords. But, each thing now for present flight prepair'd, Æneas in his schip secure did sleep, When to his eyes the god againe appear'd, Such as before, and thus did seame to speak, Lyk Mercury in all, in ?owthfull stature, In golden haires, in speach, in face, in feature: “Fair Venus' issue, canst thow now tak ease, And pond'rest not thy perillows estate? Hath sleep so much o'rcome thy fainting eyes, That thow regard'st no danger nor deceate? Rests thow secure, whil death doth the invade, Vnwar what plottes against thy life ar laid? “Hear'st thow not how the whisling winds invite the? Sweet-breathing Zephyr with a gentle gale From hence to haiste seames smilingly t'entraite the; For death-bent Dido, full of bitter bale, Transported with a rageing spait of ire, 'Gainst the is minded both with sword and fire. “And flyest thow not, whil flye thow may'st in peace? The seas anone shall scarce for shipps be seene; Thy navy furiows firebrands shall deface, And all the Ocean in one flame shall seeme, If fondly thow thy flight frome hence delay, Till once Aurora parte the night from day. “Haist! haist! Dispatch with speed! But more be gone! A woman wav'ring formed is by nature; Now bent to love, to hate inclyn'd anone, In only jnconstancie a constant creature.” This spoken, he evanisht owt of sight In the ayrie essence of the sable night. Æneas, with this vision dismay'd, Rouz'd vp his sleepy senses; loud did call: “Awake, my mates! too long our flight's delay'd; Hoase sayle in haste! hy to the hatches all! The thund'rer great hath sent anone by night, His winged messenger into my sight. “Now anchors wey! now let's owr navy loose! Trusse vp owr taickling! cables cut in twaine! Once let's set fordwart all with one applawse, Behold, the God admonisheth againe! We follow the, O gloriows guide, butt stay, And thy great charge we gladly all obey. “Be thow propitiows! prosper owr designe! Adjoine thy presence and thine helping might! Grant that a prosp'rows Planet now may reigne! Let happy starres arise to guide owr flight!” This having said, butt more the anchore roape, With shyning sword vnsheath't, in twaine he stroake. One earnestnes then, one fervency to all; All headlongs haiste; one ardowre all retaine; They rush, they reele, as heaven and earth did fall, And overspread with sayles the wat'ry plaine. On Neptun's back all whyt with foame they ride, And ov'r the tumbling billows fast do slide. Now was the time when as Aurora cleare Over sad earth her silver mantle spread, And in the Orient blushing did appeare, Asham't to rise frome aged Tython's bed, When watchfull Dido from her palace spy'd The Trojane fleet alongst the coast to glyde. Of shipps, hulks, galleyes, brigandines and barkes, With wings owtstreatch't, all vnder equall saile, The hudge armado, watching, she remarkes Through Neptun's empires with ane evenly gale; Whil roaring engines, throwing globes off steele, Did thunder foorth an horrible fareweell. Beating her breast with blows, with plaints the aire, Hope's wings cutt of, she enters in despare, And renting foorth, (enrage't), her golden haire: “O Jove,” she cries, “who know'st alone my care, Thus shall he go? And must I, in my soyle, Of such a vagabound receiue this foyle? “Thus is he gone? And shall not armes availl? Or shall my subjects all persue the chase With fire and sword their scornefull shipps to quail? Fy! People owt! Their fleet with flames deface! Hoase sayle in haste! Fy, now ?owr oares employ, Sack, wreak, revenge, demolish and destroy! “Complaints, farewell, which butt bewaill my wrongs, With armes and arte I will persue to death This traitour. Vengeance now to me belongs. In hope alone of sweet revenge I breath. In crwelty I will this cruell wight Surpas. No sheild shall saue him frome my spight. “But what do now prowd words availl, alace? Where art thow now thus frome thy self astray, Afflicted Dido? O how hard thy cace! What suddaine change doth thus thy minde dismay? Oh how accurst! how haples is thy fate! These threats (alace!) thow vtters now too late. “Such seem'd the when thy scepter thow didst render, When thus the fortune of thy foe thow rays'd. Is this his promise? Is his faith so slender, Whose piety each where abroad was blaz'd, Both to his Gods, and aged parent deare, Whome, worne with ?eirs, on shoulders he did beare? “Ah! might I not long since have sent to death This truethles tyrant and his fellowes all? Ah! might I not have stop't Ascanius' breath, And torne his tender flesh in parcells small? Then drest him for that traitour false to eate, To fairse his belly with so kindly meate. “O that I had their shipps once set on fire, And ov'rlofts all with flaming firebrands fill'd! O that thir hands at once both sonne and syre, And all those traitours cruelly had kill'd! O, then how gladly should this hand and sword In that same moment als my death afford! “Thow great Apollo, whose bright gloriows ey With piercing rayes each work on earth doth viewe; Thow, Juno, guilty of my misery, Sacred Diana, with thy silver hew, Whose triple-horned forhead doth controule Skies, earth and hell,—the night's swift moving soule; “?ee heavenly pow'rs, just, bountyfull, divine! ?e, in whose safegarde wretch't Eliza lived! And ?e, O furyes! O vindictive tryne! Who venge their wrongs who are vnjustly grieved, Pitty my plaints! O ?eeld to my desire! Vpon those traitours exercise ?owr ire! “If so must be this exsecrable wight At heaven's dispose must passe the Stygian tide, And after death enjoy that wished sight, Ferry'd by Charon to the farther side, ?it grant! O grant, whil flesh his ghost doth wrap, Plague, sword and famine, be his surest hap! “Of awfull natiounes let him feele the force, Frome place to place persu'd, in saifty never. Exil'd, in neid, butt any man's remorce, Dissev'red from his only child for ever. Imploring pitty, let him none obtaine; But see his people with dishonour slaine. “And if he ever peace on earth enjoy, Short be his reigne; soone may his dayes be spent. And, whill he breathes, be never butt annoy; But by vntimely death his powr prevent; Syne rott on ground butt honour of a grave: This I emplore, this with my blood I crave. “Last, to his linage showe despight and ire, Deir people whose true love a life I fand! This latest favo? onely I require, Let never love nor league betwixt ?ow stand! O let mine ashes, after death, afford One to destroy those clownes with fire and sword! “As time and place permitts, both now and ay, Let discord alwise, and debate domine! Let shoare to shoare, let streame 'gainst streime, I pray, And let owr ofspring ever armes reteine!” Heir closing, deeply she doth now revolve, What way she soonest may her life dissolve. Then calling on Sicheus' aged nurse, (Of purpose only to be left alone), “Go, Barce! carefull nurse, direct thy cowrse To Anna, pray her heir arive anone, With waters purg't from each polluted thing, Expiatory offrings caws her bring. “And thow, enfold with sacred cloithes thine head; The rites intended now I minde to finish To Stygian Jove, which must afford remead, Whereby my cares may peice and piece diminish.” With aged pase, this said, to haste enclin'd, She stagg'ring foorth did show her fordward minde. Now deathbent Dido, (trembling fast for feare Her horrible attemptings to persue, Rolling her eyes, which bloody did appeare, And flaming sparkles of her fury showe, With sorrow-tainted cheiks, and deadly hew), Look't pale for horrour of the fact t'ensue. But quickly ent'ring where the flame was fram'd, The wodden heap she doth amount anone; The haples sword she in her hand retain'd Vnsheath'd, which once pertain'd to him was gone; That cursed blaide, that instrument of death, Ordained never to abridge her breath. Thair whil her eyes, which still butt motion stair'd, Th' acquainted cowtch and remnant weids did viewe, Paussing, (now vtterly of life despair'd), With gushing teares her breath a litle d[r]ew; Syne tumbling on the bed, withowt moe words, Thir latest speaches she, poore soull, affords: “O thow sweet vesture! and O happy bed! Whil heavens above and dest'nyes did permitt, That once, ah! once with ?ow my life I led, Receive this soull, frome me which hence doth flitt, This fleshly preson ready now to leave, And of all earthly toyles ane end to have. “My glasse is spent; my time I have owt-lived; The race is runne, which Dest'nyes did designe; And as the heavens my terme of life contrived, Swa have I lived, accomplisht in my reigne. So now this earthly shaddow goeth to grave; So now at once this loathed lyf I leave. “Skie-matching Carthage from the ground I rais'd; Her staitly walls I floorishing did viewe; My wrath vpon the prowd Pigmalion seas'd, My lord Sicheus trait'rously who slewe. Happy, (alace)! too happy had I beene, If never Trojane ship my shoare had seene.” With drowping gesture and dejected eye, “Die shall I,” sayes she, “and no vengeance finde? Butt die thow must, faint Dido, boldly die: Thus, thus my breath I render in the winde. Now let the traitour viewe, though not regrate, This flame, the presage of my present Fate. “But oh! ?it art thow, (feeble flesh), affray'd? Why trembles thow to be depriv'd of breath? Oh coward hand! and art thow als dismay'd To be the executioner of Death? Though hands, though flesh doth faint, O fearles knife, End thow my cares, and cut my threed of life!” With gushing teares, those words whil as she spak, The cursed blaide but more her purpose brak, Which in her breast vnto the hilts she strak, Withowt remorse: O exsecrable fact! The wepon, foaming in her luk-warme blood, Maide open passage to the gushing flood. Her Dams attending see their mistris fall On piercing sword, with armes abroad owthrow'ne, Sprauling in paine, with blood begoared all, Which freshly from her wonded breast was gone: The skreigh is rais'd, with many rewfull cries, The clamours great reverberat the skies. Fame through the citty blaz'd her fall anone; Anone the streets with those sad newes ar fill'd; The women wailing ?eeld a pitteows mone, Viewing their Princes and their lady kill'd. Showts, sighs, smarte, sorow, all each where abound; With hiddeows noyse the hallow hevens resownd. Most lyk, as by some vnexpected plott, The rageing en'my ent'red had the citty; The bulwarks brave downe batt'red all with shott; With dint of sword destroying all butt pitty. Whate'ere occur'd made objects of their rage, Regairdles both of sexe, of ?owth, of age. Whil rageing flames of furiows spreiding fire, The buildings both of gods and men devore: Whil rewfull cries of those who life require, With dying groanes for pitty who emplore, For rewth would rent a flinty heart a sunder: Such were the clamoures through the air did thunder. But Anna, wofull nymph, ran trembling there, Confus'd and speachles, where the noyse was heard. Faint, breathles, pale, astonisht, full of feare, To see this rewfull object she appear'd; Then, preissing through the throng, her call'd by name, And oft, “Dear Dido! Dido!” did exclame. “Ah sister! wast for this thow sought by slight To syle my sight, thy curs't designes to cloake? Ah! wast for this the flame I built on hight? To this intent or did the altars smoake? Ah wretched wight, left now thyself alone! Forsaken soull! what shall I first bemone? “Did ever I demerite such disdaine, That thow thine Anna hast at death debarr'd To be thy convoy? to partake thy paine? And reape with the the fruits of thy reward? Hast thow despis'd thine only sister thus? Such guerdon never was deserv'd of vs. “O! since one sword, dy'd in a crimson streame, Had in one moment both bereft of breath. But ah! and have thir hands, (O lasting shame!) Prepair'd the flame, as guilty of thy death? Call'd I my Gods at altars, prostrate lowe, Alace! ?it absent at thy last ov'rthrowe. “Thy self, thy sister, and thy subjects all, Thy citty, senate, kingdome and estate, Each by one stroak destroy'd, with the do fall, And perish all by thy abortive Fate.” This said: her bleeding wounds she bath'd in haist, And kyndly her in dying armes embract. Then seazing on her death-seal'd lipps to knowe If any sponk of breath as ?it remain'd, The streaming teares her face did overflowe, Whil as she, clasping in her armes, retain'd Her half-dead sister, faintly drawing breath In dead-throwe ent'ring at the gates of death. She, feeling in this agony of minde, (With soft though sad embraces oft bestowd), Herself in such frequented bounds confin'd, As mindefull of the favo? Anna show'd, To lift her eyes assay'd, but streight did faill: Her heart fix't wounds presage a sad farewell. Then leining on her elbowe, preis'd in vaine, Thrie times her body from the bed to rayse; Three times she fainting tumbles downe againe, Death on her senses ready now to seaze. Three times she strove to see the cristall skies, And three times clos'd again her gazing eyes. Then heaven's Arch-empresse from her azure tent, Viewing this dead-lyve lover's toylsome end, Her stormy breast compassion did relent, And Iris quickly from the clouds did send To calme the combat, and compoise the sight Betwix her drossie flesh and ayrie spright. For sith no dest'ny did abridge her breath, Nor due deserved death her day prevent; Both spightfull rage did antidate her death, And turn'd the Glasse befor her howr was spent. Her haires as ?it Proserpine had not touch't, Nor by such gift th' Elysian groaves enrich't. On saffroun pineouns soaring then anone, The winged Iris cutts the cristall skies, In thowsand colours shining 'gainst the Sunne, Doth light at lenth where this poore patient lyes: Syne off'ring vp her haires at Pluto's shryne, “Leave, leave,” (quoth she), “this corps, O soule divine!” Thus whil she said, with fingers heavenly white The golden fleece clip't frome her head in haist. The native heit her limmes abandon'd quite, Then in ane instant, by cold death displac't, Her breath expiring, ane eternall sleep Did piece and piece vpon her senses creep. Finis.

Thou Lord, with glorious beams Ioh. 1. 9.all bright, Blazing around thy Throne of light, Exod. 33. 20.Outreaching farre my feeble sight, 1 Tim. 6. 16.Heere, in death's shade exylde, Sin's clouds dispell, guilt's loade make light, Which doth surcharge my fainting spright, That I may spreade thy praise, thy might, With heart pure, vndefyl'de. Ioh. 4. 24.With worship chast, in soule sincere, Thou shouldst bee celebrate in feare. Hence, yee Mat. 7. 6.vncleane, that darre appeare With hands, with hearts prophaine. O! let a Esay. 6. 7.Seraphim draw neare, A flamming Coale whose hand doth beare, My lips, my heart, from Heauen's high spheare to purge from double staine. Then shall these documents divine, By which thy crosses fruits do shyne, To happie Life conducting Thyne, my Thoughts by day, by night, With meditation deepe consyne: At morne, midday, my weake engyne, While Heaven's clear Torch his course decline shall in thy praise delight. Sonne, with thy Syre in Ioh. 1. 12.yeares, in might, In all Phil. 26. 15.co-equall: Ro. 11. 33.man's dimme sight Transcending: Heb. 1. 3. Col.1. 6-67. like thy paterne bright An Other, and the Same: True God of God, mild Matt. 1. 16. 1.Maid-borne wight, Blest Gen. 28. 11.Ladder, reaching earth aright, Co-apting things of greatest hight with lowe: Light's glorious beame. Safetie of Soules, Sight of the blinde, Haven, where the shipwrakt shelter finde, End of all toyles, Ease of the minde, press'd downe with sinfull loade; Reward of works due in no kinde To conflict past, the Palme assignde, Soules' cure, with sin's sore sicknesse pynde, the banisht man's aboade. Blest Gen. 9. 14.bow, bepaynting azure aire, Thy pledge who did the World repaire; Gen. 6. 14.Arke, rendring Thine secure from care of ouerflowing floods; Their Crowne that sight, their pryze most rare That sum: earth's peace, heauen's joy, hell's feare; A saving 1 Cor. 10. 4.Rock to thine, a 1 Cor. 12. 3.snare to such as sinne secludes. Luc. 2. 32.Israel's glory, Luc. 10.Gentiles' light, Summe of the father's wisht-for sight, Of Paradise the deare delight, eternall Tree of life; On source which watering day and night, In foure cleare streames divided right, Preserues, from yeares, from dayes despight, but arte, or gardner's knife. The Rom. 10. 4.Lawes, the Act. 10. 40.Prophet's scope, who shew Thy face when Thou the 2 Cor. 3. 14.vaile withdrew; Of Types, of Col. 2. 17.Shads, the body true; Io. 1. 36.Lambe, Heb. 13. 10.Altar, Heb. 2. 17.Priest at ones; Rev. 13. 8.Lambe, kild before the World's first view; Altar, which sinne inherent slew; Priest, who in man did grace renew, mounting alone Heb. 9. 24.heauen's Thrones. I sing my Heb. 9. 15.Mediator's praise, Whose hand o're all the scepter swayes; Who Col. 1. 20.Angel's fall did stint, yet stayes; 1 Cor. 1. 30.man falne did raise againe. Who filde the breach by wondrous wayes Of Heauen's proud Apostats, hell's preyes, Earthlings adornde with Angells' rayes, 'mongst the immortall traine: But say, (sweet Iesu,) what procurde Thee, in a Phil. 2. 7.servant's shape immurde, To pittie man in sinne obdurde, God's rebell to beefriend? To pleade for him who thee abjurde, Suffring thy Godhead lurke obscurde, Last, on the Phil. 2. 8.Tree, (O Tears!) indurde an ignominious end? Tim. 1. 15.Else perisht had the World for aye, Col. 1. 20.No other Meanes God's wrath could lay, Rom. 6. 4.None else, could, (working death's decay,) Man's Image first, infuse. Gal. 3. 13.None else, Law's paine severe could pay; Heauen's walls to scale no other way; Rom. 8. 11.To vernish fresh graues rotten prey, Means Thou alone couldst vse. Without thee Lord, supremely blest, Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11.Whom highest honour doth invest, Esay 53. 7, 10.For Man with paines extremly prest by spoyles of conquer'd Hell, Heaven's glorious courts had neere encrest: Nor should our fleshes loade, to rest Aboue the Spheares, its selfe addrest, 'midst heauen's blest hosts to dwell. Hence sprang Man's ease exyling toyle, His hopelesse groanes, which so did boyle Thy breast, that Thou pourd'st in the oyle of Mercie in his wounds. Esay. 53.His Plaints procur'd thy soules turmoyle, That Thou his lot didst take, to foyle Sinne, Death and Hell, O Glorious spoyle! which reason's ray confounds. Our guilt's foule shame shame did deface, Empurp'ring thy vnstained face; Thy clouds, thy care, our light, our peace, Our Victorie thy listes; Thy hels in heauen procurde vs place, Our honour grew by thy disgrace; O Wisedome! if not found by grace, Man's wit involves in mists. O Sauing Knowledge! which of right 1 Cor. 1. 21.The deepest Polititan's sight Oresyles, drownde in eternall night, Jn clowdes of self-conceate! O contrares! which by nature fight, Thus reconcil'de, mix'd by thy might, Things weightie ballancing with light, O change! O wonders great! Thy dumpes our doolefull hearts did cheare; Our teare-blind sights thy teares did cleare; Thy deepe afflictions calmde our feare; Thy bands vs fred from paine. 2 Cor. 8. 9.Thy wants our wealth procur'de; we weare Roabs by thy rags; grieves thou didst beare, Our greifes, our languishings en-deare, thy blood did ours restraine. Luc. 2. 44.That crimson sweat, these drops which drownd Thy blessed face, with rayes ours crownde; Rev. 5.Sin's leprous spots, which soules confound, from Parents' seede they purgde. Thou, shak'd by death's approaching wound, 'gainst death mad'st vs secure be found, Thou of our innocence the ground, for vs, with guilt was vrgde. Mat. 27. 46.And when thou seemde some space to bee Depriv'de from heauen of all supplie, Yet banisht Man, still deare to Thee, Thou neuer didst forsake. Man's state was still before thine Eye, Till entring Hell, Thou sett him free, O Deut. 23.Crosse once curst, now happie Tree, Source whence all good wee take! When Thou thy selfe triumphde o're sho's, Nailde to the Crosse, exposde to blo's, Chargde by thy proud insulting foes with infamie, with shame; Torne, naked, pale, a mappe of woes, Whilst floods of wrath thou vndergoes, Thy syde trans-fixde, from which forth floes a Ioh. 19. 34.double gushing streame; Luk. 23. 46.Thy soule commending to thy Syre, While twixt two Luk. 23. 39.Theeues Thou didst expire; Col. 2. 15.Loe! then enlarging thine Jmpire, Thy foes Thou Captiues led; Triumphing on the Tree, hell's ire, Hos. 13. 14.Death's sting, Earth's Kings that did conspire, Bound, hand and foote, thy wrath's hote fyre their shame before Thee bred. Thou ledst, (great Victor,) foylde in fight, Those Hab. 2. 14.bands, in darknesse that delight; Roots of man's ruine, foes to right, Rom. 8. 2.Sin, bound Thou didst detaine; To Heauen's high courtes, a glorious sight, God's Rebells vanquishde by thy might, Condemnde in chains of horride night, for euer to remaine. Loe! heere, death's Cor. 15. 26.double-poynted sting, 1 Cor. 15. 56.Law's hand-writ there traverst, (death's spring,) Trode vnderfoote, in triumph, bring Thou didst, Col. 2. 14.nail'd to thy crosse. Thee, swallowing vp, (death conqu'ring King,) 1 Cor. 15. 55.Death to it selfe the graue did bring; On rav'ning Wolfe preyde ravishde thing, Victorious by losse. By death insulting held as dead, Death's death Thou was, and death's remeed. Iohn 1. 18.O! Thou who dost God's secreets spread, Author, revealer wise, Heauen's pure delight, the woman's seede, Who, Gen. 3. 15.treading downe the Serpent's head, To wretched Man didst pittie plead, Way, leading to the Skyes! Oh, what had beene our fearefull fate, Deare soules Redeemer? what our state? Of ire what hudge, inunding spaite, had quenchde our of-spring weake? Without thee, Lord, hell's preys of late, Col. 1. 1.Who mongst thy saints didst vs relate, And mounting heauens with glorie great, deathes brazen barres didst breake? Who saues vs in the day of ire, When all shall be refinde with fire? Who with thy Sp'rit dost vs inspire, 2 Cor. 5. 5. Arls of eternall Life? Thy Sp'rit of peace, our pledge, our hyre, Eph.1. 13, 14. Who, all vnites of thy empire To Thee, our Head, our soules desire, for ever shunning strife. His seuen-fold grace doth vs defend From snares; the World, the flesh forth send; From Fiends infernall, which doe bend theirs pow'rs 'gainst Thine, by night; Which flie like Psal. 91. 5, 6.pestes by day; in end On winges, with faith and hope empen'd, Heauen's starrie circuits wee transcend, by vertue of his might. Hee, who eternallie foorth came, With Father and with Sonne, the Same Third 1 Ioh. 5. 8.branch, joynd with that twofold stream, Rom. 8. 16.witnesse on earth to beare: By him confirmde, wee Eph. 2. 18. accesse claime To God's hie Throne: with feare and shame Brought low, by him wee doe proclaime, Rom. 8. 15. Abba, O Father deare! Rom. 8. 26.He, sending vp a secreet grone, Doth penetrat God's eares anone; No wordes, no cryes can reach his throne, nor speedier pierce the skies: He doth vnsyle the eyes alone Of soules sincere, to them is showne The lawes hid sense: Hee doth enthrone the lowe; the proud despise. Soules languishing his grace revives; To wandring steps hee regresse gives; The falne liftes vp, deathes throe's relieues, by warme light of his flame. The hardest heart of flint he reaves; For subjects, Rebells home receiues; Subdues the stubburne, that believes no hardnesse breedes him shame. Ev'n as perfumes, which most excell, Worke on weake sents, and doe dispell All former loathings: So befell Thy Saints, the Virgines deare: Cant. 1. 23.How soone thy Name's sweet fragrant smell Was powred foorth, all prostrate fell, Who gainst Thee did before rebell, Thy yoke now gladly beare. O! let this dewy showre descend, Of thy sweet Oyle, that We in end That Rocke of safetie may ascend admitting no retreat. Conduct vs who on thee depend, ( Col. 3. 4.Life-giuing essence,) vs defend, Who here our days in dangers spend, which vs each moment meete. Lead vs, poore Pilgrims vnexpert, Our Compasse, Pilote, Pole, who art, Through this inhospitall desert, this vaile of bitter teares, Where perill lurkes in euerie part, Where Asps their poys'nous stings forth dart, Whose plaines no pleasures else impart, but scrotching drought and feares. Esay. 55. 1.Lead vs, those rivers to frequent, Where milke and honey yeelds content. O! euer blesse, with good event, the wrestlings of thine owne, Till, comming in the firmament, Unlookt for by earth's trembling tent, When time's last Rev. 10. 16.Period shall bee spent, Thy glory thou make knowne. That Day shall rest Rev. 6. 14.Heauen's rolling spheares, Earth's refluous tumults, deathes pale feares, Rev. 22. 5.O day, which neuer night outweares, Night, by no day displac't! Then, to the source flood's course reteires, Time lurking then, no more appears, Hid in the vast abysse of yeares, from whence it first did haste. Rev. 21. 4.O day, which doth all blesse impart To all, who vpright are in heart! Rev. 21. 8.O day of horrour, full of smart, to all of sprite impure! Rev. 21. 4.Day, which shall sobs of saints convert In songes of Joy! Day which shall dart Wrath on the wretcht, who then shall start wak'd from their sleepe secure! Mat. 24. 31.That Trumpet's terrifying sound, That day, their ears, their souls, shall wound, In sin's deepe Lethargie long drownde, to heare a fearefull doome; Whose noise, whose murmurings profound Shall call, whate're earth's limits bound, Rev. 20. 13.Or who in floods o'rewhelmde are found, hid in the Ocean's wombe. Thess. 4. 16. 17.Who cheard are with the World's bright Eye, Jnvest'd yet with mortalitie, Or whose dead ashes scattered flie, dispersde through earth or aire; This dayes sharpe tryall all must see, If entered once lifes miserie, Yea, babes, which scarce yet breathing bee, must at this sound appeare. 2 Thes. 1. 8.When flammes shall furiously confound, Lightning thy glorious Throne around, Whate're shall bee their object found, in this inferiour Frame, Shaking the World, ev'n to the ground, Razde from its center, laid profound, Dissolving what earth's fabricke crownde with greatest Arte, or fame; Mark 13. 24.The Sun's cleare beames clouds shall enfold, Rev. 6. 13.Starres losse their light, (earth's pride controld,) What Earthlings did most precious hold, 2 Pet. 3. 10.records of wit, of strength, 2 Pet. 3. 10.Shall with this monument's rare mold More quicklie melt than can bee told, All this great All shall, (as of old,) a Chaos turne at length. Esay. 19. 20.Then when the screiches, and frightfull cryes Or such, God's wrath as vnderlyes, Encrease the noise of rushing skies, of earthes disjoynted frame, Mat. 25. 22.Hee makes divorce that's only wise; The damned goates hee doth despise; Poynts out his lambes, Rev. 7. 14.whose sinfull dyes hee purgde with bloody streame. Rev. 7. 9.When blessed soules shall, fred of feare, Thy Throne encircling, Thee draw neare, As dayes comforting Beame, the spheare, the Orbe of purest heauen; The clouds transcending, Rev. 11. 12.shining cleare, Rev. 14. 14.Thy footsteps streatched foorth to beare, Those trembling bands shall streight reteare, downe to the Center driven. Trembling to heare the thundring noise Of thy three-forked fearefull voyce, Which streight their soules with sad annoyes, with terrours strange shall pierce: Mat. 25. 41.Hence, hence yee cursed! hell's convoyes, Who of this Portion earst made choyse, In chaines of darknesse end your Joyes, amidst hell's furyes fierce. Goe curst for aye, exylde from light, From hope, from Rev. 14. 12.rest, from all delight, Where wormes ne're dying, wrath and spight, Matt. 25. 20.gnashing of teeth, and teares. O! then, what horrour, what affright Shall on those hopelesse prisners light, Debarrde eternally his sight who on the Throne appeares. Rev. 5. 9.Deare World's Redeemer! let thy bloode, Mee, from this multitude seclude, Affraide to see the raging flood, of thy vnbounded ire: Grant J may 'mongst thy Matt. 5. 8.blessed broode Surfet vpon that heauenly foode Of thy sweet face; the chiefest goode Thyne haue, or can desire. That life which did thy bandes releiue, When laide in graue, Rom. 8. 11.may mee revive, Raisde from deathes Jayle with thee to liue, eternally above, Joyes more than mortalls can belieue, Contents, which thou alone canst giue, Hid treasures, which no wrong can reave, enjoying of thy loue. Cloyde with delights, with dainties rare With which heauen's tables charged are, 1 Cor. 2. 9.Which man's weake Eye, amazed Eare nor Heart, can right conceave, Things hid by his eternall care, Who doth them for his Saintes prepare, Who, gaining him, the fairest faire, they All in all things have. 1 Cor. 15. 24.When conquring life hath death subdued, This World's false Rev. 21. 1.shew our sight eschued, Whose face and countenance renewde shall more delightfull seeme, Thou, who with grace thy Saintes indued, Whose shield them from this wrath rescued, Transport mee thither, all bedewed with blood did mee redeeme. Rev. 22. 16.Bright Starre—illightning darkest night, Attractive loadstone, full of might, Jnflamt by thy transpeircing sight, there draw my heatlesse heart; Winge my desires, that raisde on hight, Rev. 21. 4.I may arriue by heauenly flight There, where's no feare of ill, no spight, but blesse, without desart. Where J, thy praises may make knowne, Three vndivided Trinall One! Joynde with thy Saynts about thy Throne, in hymnes not made by Men. Grant this sweet Sauiour, Thou alone Crowne these desires, here to Thee showne, As to its end this raptur's flowne, Sweet Jesu, say Amen. ????? ???? ???. Finis. Doomesday containing Hells horrour and Heavens happinesse But now, my Sprite refresht a space, Forbearing pressed steppes to trace, Aspires aboue the vulgar prease, to raise a second flight. I feele my bosome, peece and peece, Warmde with vnusuall flammes: Giue place Eare-charming fancies, Artes disgrace, affoording false delight. Thoughts, which aboue the spheares inclyne, Wings, furnish to my weake engine, If Thou, O Lord, the 2 Sam. 22. 3.Horne of Thine in mee, this Rapture wrought. Bee present by thy power divine, Grant in my lines thy might may shyne, From drosse of sinne my sprite refine, raise from the earth my thought. But why thus pants thou in my breast Affrighted soule, deprivde of rest? What sudden feares thy joyes molest? what jarres disturbe thy peace? Why tremblest thou, with terrours prest, To heare that fearefull doome exprest By that great Judge, who euer blest, is just, as full of grace? Heere pause a space, (My Soule,) acquent Thy selfe this judgement to prevent: No moment of our time is spent, which thither doth not lead. The dangers seene which doe torment Thy troubled mind with discontent, Gainst them let fervent sutes be sent, Immunitie to plead. Haste, haste my Soule, shake off delay, Which too much of thy time makes prey. Lay vp provision for that Day there boldlie to arriue, Where Reprobats, accurst for aye, Shall wish in vaine their lifes decay, That earth would to their soules make way, them swallowing vp aliue. Oh! what encounter sad shall bee Twixt soules from darknesse chaines set free, And bodies, mates in miserie, calde foorth to bee combynd, Not for reciprocall supplie, As friends new joynde in amitie, But neuer dying, aye to die, in quenchlesse flammes confynde. Death's loathsome den, detested Jayle, Scout, following sin with stretched sayle, Which fleeting froaths, which pleasures fraile, on Rocke of shipwrack led. Maske of mischiefe, sin's slender vaile, Good Motions euer bent to quaile, Which in the birth thou didst assaile, them burying as they bred. Wretch, who to pamper dust didst doate, Whom Hell attends with open throate, Readie to retribute the lote to thy deservings due. Oh! what hath violate death's knot, That still in graue thou didst not rot, Masse overspred with sin's foule spot, raisde anguish to renue. Thus, (too, too late,) the Soule shall rayle; Re-entring this abhorred Iayle, Which recombyned, while both bevaile Life's misgoverned raines. Then Angels shall to Judgement haile, There, whence no party can appeale, To heare deathe's sentence countervaile, Lyfe's Ioyes, with endlesse paines. O wretch! who Judgement heere delayes, Whom false securitie betrayes, Who ne're thy Sins' blacke summe surveyes, which future anguish breedes. Then shall the Auncient of dayes, Who all men's works in ballance layes, Examine all thy wordes, thy wayes, thy thoughts, thy foule misdeeds. None shall this search seuere eschew, From bookes laide open to the view A summar processe shall ensew, conforme to thy trespasse. Thy sins all summond, Thee which slew, Approving thy damnation due, When all the blest cœlestiall crew shall on thee verdict passe. Thou, who to lewdnesse now art prone, What shame, what smart, (lif's pleasures gone,) Shall on thee seaze, when gazde vpon By earth, by angrie heauen? When naked, comfortlesse, alone, Thou trembling stands before the Throne, Under God's wrath, guilt's loade doth grone, Feares with thy faults made eaven. When thy tormenting conscience torne, Thou guiltie stands that Iudge beforne, Whose Image did thy soule adorne, who did infuse thy breath. Who, pittying thee to sin forlorne, Left heauens, was of an earthling borne, Liude loth'd, dyde with contempt and scorne, Emptyed the Cup of wrath. Witnesse earth trembling at his paines, Dayes beame, which all in clouds detaines, The silver Moone, which pale remaines, For horrour of the sight. Witnesse his hands, with bleeding veines, Of this great All which holds the raines, His side pierc't through to purge thy staines, Polluted sinfull wight. Where shall thou then safe shelter finde Soule, than the sightlesse Mole more blinde, When with those straits extreame confynd, Faint, pale, confusde thou stands? By doome which cannot bee declinde, Adjugde for euer to be pinde, Where day nere dawnde, Sunne neuer shinde, Mongst the infernall bands. Where tears no truce, playnts find no place, On either hand in desp'rate cace, Behinde thee, who thy pathes did trace, Attend thy woefull lote. Before thee, flamms Earth's frame deface, Aboue, an angrie Judge's face, Below, Thee gaping to embrace, Hell's sulphure-smoking throat. Thy feares shall be with cryes encrest Of damned Soules, with anguish prest, With greife, with horrour vnexprest, Of due deserved ire. The fyre-brands of a conscious brest, Shall of thy terrours not be least, While worms, which on thy conscience feast, Thy ceaselesse paine conspire. But when, (most like a thunder dart,) That separating doome, Mat. 25. 41. Depart, Pronounc'd, shall pierce thy panting heart, With a most fearefull knell, Which shall thee from God's presence part, Exposde to torments that impart Nor end of time, nor ease of smart, While headlongs hurld in hell. Their shalt thou dive in depthes profound, Still sinke but never meete a ground, In waves still wrestling to bee drownd, Deluded still by death; Crying, where comfort none is found, Pynde, where no pittie rage doth bound, Thy Cup with floods of vengeance crownde, Of the Almightie's wrath; Bathde in a bottomlesse abisse, Paine still encressing, ne're remisse, Where scorpion's sting, where serpent's hisse, Wormes, neuer satiate, gnaw; Rackt, thinking what thou was, now is, Deprivde for aye from hope of blisse, For toyes, eternall joy didst misse, Nor crub't by love, nor aw, No torments doth it selfe extend Paine of Sense. Heere all the members to offend, Which Vniversall griefe doth send, Doth every part entrinch: These paines, which reason's reach transcend, On Soule and body doth descend, No joynt, nerve, muscle, without end But sev'rall plagues doe pinch. Lascivious Eye, with objects light Which earst did entertaine thy sight, Weepe, there exylde in endlesse night, Lockt vp in horride shads. Nyce Eare, whose Organ earst did spight All sounds, whence flowde no fals delight, There, horrour ever and affright, Thy curious sense vpbraids. Smell, earst with rare perfumes acquent, Still interchangde to please thy sent, For incense, sulphure, (there) doth vent, Smoake for thy odoures sweet. Taste, vnto which to breed content, Rob't were the Earth, Sea, Firmament, 'Mongst soules which penurie torment, There, famine Thee doth meete. Vile wormeling, Thou whose tender pride, The weakest sunshine scarce couldst byde, There, plungde in this impetuous tyde, Must feele the force of fire. Where damned soules on every syde, Howling and roaring still abyde, Which finde no shelter them to hyde From this eternall ire. There, the Ambitious, who in skies Did, (late,) on wax-joynde winges arise, Of base contempt is made the pryse, The Proudling pestred downe. There Dives, who did earst despise Of famisht soules the piercing cries, Shall one cold drop of water pryse Aboue a Monarche's crowne. Loe! there the vile, licentious goate, Whom lawlesse lust did earst besotte, Enchainde in the embracements hotte Of furious raging flames. There, to the drunkard's parched throate, Justice doth scrotching drought allote, In floods of fire, which judgde to floate, Still vaine refreshment claimes. On covetous, on cruell wight, Shall equall weight of vengeance light With byting vsurie, with spight, The poore ones who did presse. So, to the remnant that did fight 'Gainst heauen's decrees, their conscience light, God's wrath shall bee proportionde right, By measure more or lesse. Soule, which vnpittied ever playnes, Paine of Losse. Heere, suff'ring for thy sins' foule staynes, Flammes, lashing whips, rackes, fyrie chaynes, Tormenting outward sense. Of all, most terrible remaines, Losse of God's face while thou sustaines, O hell of hell! O paine of paines! Still to be banisht thence. But when thou hast as many yeares Those tortures felt, as shyne in sphears Lights, fixed and straying, eyes haue teares, Or waves the azure plaine, No nearer are their end those feares, Ever beginning which thou beares, No change abates, no date outweares Thy euer pinching paine. O dying life! O living death! O stinging fyre, blowne by God's breath! O boyling lake no ground which hath, Destroying nought it burnes! O overflowing flood of wrath, Which damned soules are drencht beneath! O pit profound! O woefull path Whence Entrer ne're returnes! Sweet Rom. 5. 10.Reconciler, Prince of peace, Who pittying man's most wretched cace, Didst hellish agonies embrace In soule, in bodie shame, Let mee in those extreames finde grace, Illightned by thy glorious face, Rank't 'mongst thy Saints, the elect race, Whose wayes Thou didst proclaime! O! Let me safe protection plead Unto my soule, which full of dread, Hanges ouer Hell by life's fraile threed, Conservde but by thy might; That when heauens, whence it did proceed, Its separation haue decreed, With Gen. 8. 8. Noah's Doue, Thou mayst it lead There, whence it first tooke flight. Oh, how it longes on winges to rise, (Secure from sin's contagious dyes,) Endenizde citizen of skies With Thee for aye to rest! O, how it doth the Jayle despise, In fleshes fetters it which tyes, And lets it to enjoy the pryse, With which thy Saints are blest! For Thee I thirst, O living spring! Pure source of life, who guides faith's wing, By flight to reach the hyest thing, To compasse things most hard. When shalt Thou mee from danger bring To Port of peace? my God! my King! Blest giver, and the gifted thing? Rewarder, and reward? When shall I, from exile set free, My native home, my country see? When one immortal pineons flie? That holy Citie reach, Whose streets pure gold, gold buildings bee, Walls, stones most precious beautifie, Apoc. 19. 21. Ports, solide Pearles, Guests neuer die, Whose peace no paines empeach? Eternall spring, (shrill Winter gone,) This climate constant makes alone, Nor flamming heate, nor frozen Zone Distemper heere doe breed. From Lambe's sweet breath, on glorie's throne Enstalde, are balmie odours throwne, Time hath no turnes, heere change is none, No seasons doe succeed. Pale envy, emulation, spight, Nor death, nor danger heere affright, Heere hopes, nor feares, nor false delight, In sublunarie toyes. Apoc. 21. 23. No Lampe dartes foorth alternat light, The Lambe's sweet face here shines ay bright, Which of the Saints doth blesse the sight, Who doe in him rejoyse. Heere simple beautie scorneth Arte, Rose-cheeked youth, old age's dart, Joye's perpetuitie impart, No warre disturbs this peace. O! this God's Palace royall arte, Preparde in these, with all desart, 1 Pet. 1. 20. For all that vpright are in heart, Ere light did paynt heaven's face. Thou, by whose pow're the spheares are rold, Earth's hanging orbe who dost vphold, Great Architect, King vncontrold, Lord of this Universe, Enstalde heere on a Throne of gold, Dost diamantine scepter hold, Givest Lawes to earth, hence dost behold How wights below converse! If heere, such eye-enchaunting sights, Amazing beauties, choise delights, This Mansion low, of dying wights, Earth's brittle orbe adorne, What wonders then, what glorious lights, Must beautifie those reachlesse hights, Thy blest aboade, which daye's, which night's Vicissitude doth scorne? If these such admiration breed, What Thou, who did'st heauen's Curtain spread, Earth stayde midst aire, that it doth neede Its weight nought to sustaine, Who full of Majestie and dread, Of intellectuall pow'rs dost plead Attendance, on thy face which feede? O ever blessed traine! Archangels, Angels, clothde with might, Thrones, Cherubs, Seraphins of light, Princes and Powers all shining bright, Dominions, vertues pure, With beames that sparkle from the sight, Inflamde, which flie no other flight, But satiat rest, rapt with delight, Which doth for aye endure! O sweet societie! how blest They, who these orders haue encreast, From labour free, in peace who rest, Surpassing humane sense? Where blesse, where glory doth invest Apostles, Martyres and the rest Of holy Saints, with tortures prest To death, in Trueth's defence. The Patriarchs, Prophets, Lights divine, (Cleare starres on earth,) bright suns here shine. Heere all the elect hoast, deathe's line Which yet haue ouerpast. Jncorp'rat in their Head, incline One way, Joyes common all combine, This band no discord can vntwine, Loue doth eternall last. Of glorie 'mongst these bands elect 1 Cor. 4. 6. Degrees there are, but no defect, Full vessells all, none can expect More than the lest containes. Dan. 12. 3. Man's heart no pleasure can project, But greater doth from hence reflect, One cause in all workes one effect, Of measure none complaines. O Joyes! my drossie sprite which wing Upwards, aboue the spheares to spring, (Time's Father) where thy praises ring, Which Saints, which Angels raise: Where all around Thee in a ring, Apoc. 9. 1. Heau'ns hoasts high Allelujahs sing, O heavenly consort! Blessed King! Blest people, Thee who praise! No woefull earth-confined wight, With owlish eyes can view this light, The meake horizon of Man's sight, Farre, farre which doth outreach. This vnexpressible delight, Doth reason's dazelde eye benight, What I cannot conceiue aright, Lord, let experience teach! Give mee, that in some measure small (While fleshe's bands my sprite enthrall) J may, a farre, a glance let fall, At these contentments poynt, These termlesse Joyes which, (one day,) shall In honny turne Saints' bitter gall, From guilt, when flamms shall purge this Ball, This Engine hudge disjoynt. When the Arch-angel's voice shall raise 1 Cor. 15. 52. The graues pale guests, the World amaze, Around all burning in a blaze, 1 Thes. 4. 16. Suffring for man's offence, What Joyes, then, sleeping Saints shall seaze, How much this long-longde sight them please, This sight, death's fetters which shall ease, All passed cares compense? O what a happie houre! how deare, How glorious shall this day appeare To thee my Soule, when fred from feare, Grimme death thou darst outface? When, (thy redemption drawing neare,) Luke 21. 28. Life's toyles shall trophees to Thee reare, Which cank'ring Tyme shall ne'er outweare, Nor foes' despight deface. Though tyrants haue, by doome vnjust, In furious flammes thy carcase thrust, Not daigning It to earth to trust With honour of a graue. No Atome of thy scattered dust But see this solemne Meeting must, Purgde from corruption, from rust Of sinne did It depraue; Thy shape renewde, more glorious made Than when it entred deathes darke shade, Raisde by his viuifying aide, Death's powres who did controule; With flesh adornde, which ne're shall fade, Nor rotte, in earthe's cold bosome laide, But liue for aye, the Mansion glade Of a Triumphing soule. No beautie nature brought to light Did ravish most amazed sight, Which, as farre short from day as night From This, shall not be found, Which shall adorne each new-borne wight, Co-partner of this hid delight, The lame shall leape, proportionde right, The dumbe God's praises sound, Esay 35. 6. Caught vp, when on immortall wings, 1 Thes. 14. 17. To aire this stage which ouerhings, 1 Cor. 6. 2. To meete thy Head, the Saints who brings To judge the damned traine. (Saints, earst accounted abject things, Objects of scorne, weake underlings, On thrones enstalde, now sceptred kings Eternally who reigne.) Apoc. 10 What bands enclustred thee around, Shall make the Heauens with hymnes rebound, That Thou, a straggling sheepe, art found, Their numbers to encrease? Luk. 15. 71. If they did such applauses sound At thy conversion, how profound Shall be their Joyes to see thee crownd, With them to acquiesse? As pansiue Pilgrime, sore distrest, Wearie and weake, with famine prest, Whom feare of Robbers doth infest, Straying alone, in need, If Hee, while dreaming least of rest, Should in an instant bee addrest, Where hee might live for ever blest, How should his Joyes exceed? Even so my Soule, (now on the way,) Too easily seduc't astray, When Thou shalt find this solide stay, This Center of repose, How shall the pleasures of this day, Adorning Thee with rich array, Thy suffred labours all delay, Afflictions all compose? What boundlesse Ocean of delight Shall quench all paines, all passed plight, Endured wrongs, digested spight Of tyrannizing pride, By Angels, Messengers of light, When brought in thy Redeemer's sight, Mat. 14. 3. Set free from deathe's eternall night, Adjudg't, in blesse to byde? When large Memorials shall record Mat. 25. 34. 35. 36. The meanest good thou didst afford, To poore, to sicke: when deed, nor word, Shall want the owne rewarde? The Judge, thy Advocate, thy Lord, 1 Ioh. 2. 1. Who now absolues, Thee, first restorde: O bond! O double-twisted cord! O vndeserved regard! But O! when Thou casts back thine eyes, Thy voyage dangerous espyes, Foes and ambushments, laide to surprise Thy wayes, when thou dost vieu; The traines set foorth Thee to entise, Base pleasures, which Thou didst despise, What boundlesse joyes shall thence arise, What Solace sweet ensue? What strange applauses thence shall spring, When Saints doe shout, when Angels sing, When Heauen's hie vaults loud Ecchos ring, Of that Absoluing voyce? Come yee, whose faith did vpwards spring, Contempt who on the World did fling, Blest of that great Sky-ruling King, Enter in endlesse Ioyes. O Joyes, with these as farre vn-even, To Man which to conceiue are given, As loftiest of the Planets seven Earth's Center doth transcend! Gen. 3. 24. (By wit, who prease to pry in heauen, Backe by a Cherubin is driven,) Man's Reason is a vessell riven, Can litle comprehend. O Joyes, as much bedazling sight, As day's bright Beam the weakest light, Aboue small Gnats as Eagles' flight Amidst the Clouds ensphearde! Ioyes, as farre passing all delight Yet euer heard by humane wight, As ghastly screiches of Owles which fright, With Larks' sweet layes comparde! These boundlesse Joyes, this endlese peace, 1 Cor. 13. 12. In this claims principally place, To see God clearely, face to face, Him, as He is, to view. 1 Joh. 3. 2. (Not heere, as doth fraile Adam's race, Who through a glasse this sight embrace, And steps of things created trace, To reach these pleasures trew.) With Judgement pure, to know, as knowne, These Persons three, in essence One, God varying in names alone, Father, Sonne, holy Ghost. To know why Man, to lewdnesse prone, (Angels o'repast) God did repone In state of grace, why mercy showne To some while damnde are Most. Which Joyes, on all the Saints elect, On Soules and bodies both reflect, By ravishing the Intellect, The Memory and Will; Which all the Senses doe affect, With pleasures farre aboue defect, Who can the rich contents detect, Those blessed Bands which fill? How more perspectiue, pure and free, (Sequestred from mortalitie,) The Understanding facultie, How prompter it perceiues! How more sublime the Object bee, The Union inward and more nie: Joyes of a more supreme degrie The Intellect conceaues! Here charg'd with chains of flesh and bloode, We apprehend by Organs roode, The drossie mindes of Earth's weake broode Imaginde knowledge swells: There, bathing in a boundlesse floode Of blesse, we shall, (as sprites which stoode) Know, (vnpuft vp) our Soueraigne goode, In him, all creatures els. What object can, in greatnesse, hight, In glorie, majestie, in might, This paralell, whence all delight, All pleasure only springs? With rayes of vncreated light Which cherish, not offend the sight, Who shines most blest, for euer bright, Eternall King of Kings. What Union can so strict bee found, So firme, successionlesse, profound? Man's deepest speculation drown'd Is in this vast abisse. This gulfe, this Ocean without ground, The ravisht minde doth wholly bound, It drencht heerein, with glorie crownd, Bathes in a Sea of blesse. If charming sounds, ensnaring sights, In mindes of wonder-strucken wights, Doe moue such violent delights As passe the bounds of speach, The Joyes then midst these reachlesse hights, Ay bright with euer-burning lights, Must farre transcend the loftiest flights, Wits most profound can reach. The fluide Joyes which here entise, From things corruptible arise, No Union, but externall, ties The sense and object fraile. How should wee then these pleasures prise, Which euer laste aboue the skies? This Union strict all change defies, This bonde can neuer faile. What superexcellent degrees Of Ioy, the Intellect shall seaze, When It, with cleare, vnsyled eyes, The speces, natures, strength, Of beastes, of birds, of stones, of trees, Of hearbes, the hid proprieties, Th' essentiall differences sees Of Creatures all at length? Of Ioy, what ouerflowing spaite, Inunding this Theater great, Drench with delight shall euery state Here marshalled above? Till now, euen from the World's first date, When Saints secure from sin's deceate, Their Palmes, their Crownes receiue, who late 2 Tim. 4. 8. Earth's vtmost spight did prove. Nor shall the knowledge of the paine, The torments which the damn'd sustain, The cryms which earst their soules did staine, Impare these joyes divine! These blacke Characters show most plaine God's justice, their deserved bane, The brightnesse of the blessed traine Opposde, now cleare doth shine. Their Vengeance shall the Just rejoyse, (Heaven's blesse comparde with hel's annoyes,) As earst by regal Prophet's voice, Divinely was fore-told. Saintes should, incompassed with Joys, Psalm 58. 10. Bathe in their blood, whom death destroyes, Happie, who so his life employes 'Mongst Saints to bee enrold. Heere oft, (with wonder rapt) wee find, The punishment with vertuous minde, The fault with the rewarde combinde, At which the Just repines. There, fault with punishment confinde, Rewarde, to vertuously inclinde, Eternall justice vndeclinde, Impartially assignes. As these and more joyes vnexprest, The Understanding doe invest, As in the Center of its rest, So heere, the Will doth pause In peace, which cannot bee encrest, Not wrestling passions to digest; O calme tranquillitie! how blest They whom this loadstone drawes. Hence spring such ardent flammes of loue To God, to all the Saints aboue, That not one ioy these hoasts do proue Which It doe not delight. Hence It no fewer joyes doe moue, Then God, Co-partners doth approue, Joyes infinite, which ne're remoue, Nor weakned are by slight. As soules, which horride shads enchaine, This doe not feele their meanest paine, With mates most hated to remaine For ay, by just decreite: How happie then, this glorious traine, With these eternally to raigne, Who mutuall loue doe entertaine, Insep'rable vnite! From thence a quiet, calme Content, A sympathizing sweet concent, Satietie, which vnacquent With loathing, doth arise. Man heere in earth's ignoble tent, Desires vnbounded still torment, The more hee hath, the more is bent, Things fading to comprise. O soule! which life doth heere expose To inward feares, to outward foes, Deluded by deceaving shows, With shads of seeming blesse, When with content thy Cup oreflows, When hopes nor vast desires thou knowes, How deare shall bee this sweet repose Which aye beginning is! O Peace! on which all hap depends, Man's vnderstanding which transcends, To Thee alone our labour tends, Our Pilgrimage aspires. Happie in Thee his life who spends, In Joy, in peace which never ends, To present Toyles which solace sends, Encentring our desires. By perfect Justice, what excesse Of Joy shall to the Will accresse, Out-shining Adam's righteousnesse In innocent estate? (But O! this Joy who can expresse? Not tongues of angels, Man's much lesse, O ravisht Soule! heere acquiesse, Drencht in this Ocean great.) His Reason, Adam's sense and will Did serve this God; but changeable Was this submission; now, but still All doe themselves subject To God; by bonde most durable, Fearing no fall, secure from ill, Rendring the soule most am'able To God, selfe, Saints elect. O soule dejected, plungde in feare, Which stinging thoughts, mind's horrors teare, Thy wounded sprite who canst not beare, With inward terrours torne! O how invaluable, how deare, Would this integritie sincere To Thee, (in conscience rackt) appeare, Which doth the saints adorne! This innocence which doth exclude All spots, polluting earth's fraile broode, Pure, vndistainde, perfectly good, Free from least sinfull thought: Saintes aye refreshing with that food Of God's wingde messengers, which stood Confirmde in grace by purple floode, Which Man's redemption wrought. Nor shall lesse measure of content To Memory of Saints present, How life's small period heere was spent, Encompassed with cares. From warres most pittifull event If settled, sweetest peace is spent, The Soule, which earst did most lament, Joyes most, now fred of teares. Of passed fight the doubtsome [fate] The souldier doth with joye relate. The sea-tosde wight, in dangers great, If gone, most pleasure finds. Past miseries inunding spaite Most sweetens Saint's triumphing state, Foes spoyles, which no invasion threat, Lesse ravish noble Minds. From passions fred, for happiest lote Their purest parts which did bespotte, Strugling, as exhalations hote In humide clouds inclosde; From flight of dartes, the World foorth shot, (Entisements which the best besotte,) While these in their remembrance float, How much are they rejoysde? Revoluing in this calmest peace, How God, by his preventing grace, Our steps restrainde, whilst we did trace The tempting paths of death; Of monstruous Sinnes in hottest chace, How Hee in loue did us embrace; In this to joye, Saints ne'ere shall cease, While they in blesse doe breath. The long vicissitude of years, Of Times, the Memory endeares, Since World's first Age, aboue the spheares, Of blest celestiall bands. Which, while this Companie admires, Cause of these changes, cleare appeares In Prouidence large book, which beares Records of Seas, of Lands. In this great Volumne read they shall Why Angels first, first Man did fall, Why God did this, nor These recall, Of his eternall grace. Why Hee did Abram's seede enstall, Peculiar most of nations all, And why to, Gentiles, these made thrall, Were planted in their place. In these great Archives scrold is found Why dearest Saints are trode to ground By Tyrant's pryde, to which no bound Oft is below assignde. To wit, more glorious to bee crown'd, As their affection did abound, Joyes may proportionall redound, As crosses them confinde. Nor shall the Bodie, now all bright, Mat. 12. 43. The fellow souldier of the spright, Bee frustrat of these Joyes, by right Of its redemption due. Of all, the noblest sense, the sight Impassible, not harmde by light, Aboue all measure shall delight, Amazde with wonders new. How shall the ravisht Eye admire Mat. 13. 43. When Suns past number doe appeare? Dark'ning that sparke, our hemispheare, Which cleeres with chearefull rayes? On all hands, Nought, when farre and neare, Encounters sight but objects cleare, Blest Empyrean bands, which weare Crowns, Palmes, immortall bayes? How shall this Beautie vs amaze? How on this glorie shall wee gaze? How on our bodies, which doe blaze With brightest beames of light? Our bodies, which ere death did seaze, (Death, which no prayers can appease) Most loathsome burthens were to these Whom most they now delight. What breast can bound this joye's full spaite, To see falne Angels' chayrs of state Filde with our friends, familiars late, Love long dissolvde, renewde? To see, to know, (O wonder great!) Saints all, all times did heere relate, Since Abel's blood, (a long long date,) His brother's hands imbrued? Gen. 4. 8. By force of flammes which all subdue, When broght to nought this world's false shew, Of Heauen, of earth, the fabricke new 2 Pet. 3. 13. What wonders shall afford? Things which before wee never knew, Rev. 19. 2. Charming our euer-gazing view, With pleasures endlesse, perfect, true, Which tongue cannot record. But none of all these objects rare, Can with thy sight, O Christ, compare. Fulnesse of Joy reflecteth there On these at thy right hand. In Righteousnesse thy face preclare Psal. 17. 15. Who viewing satisfied are, For which a place Thou didst prepare Before Thy throne to stand. If that great Herauld of Heaun's King, Record of Thee sent foorth to bring, For Joy, did in thy presence spring, An Embrion yet vnborne. If yet a babe, thy sight benigne So Simeon's soule with joy did sting, That hee his Obsequies did sing, With age and weaknesse worne. If Easterne Sages spar'de no paine, By Pilgrims' toyles, thy sight to gaine, An infant, borne but to bee slaine, In manger meanlie laide; What soule then can these joyes containe Which shall arise to see Thy raigne, The glory of thy heauenlie traine, Whose pompe shall never fade? But O! (Mee thinkes) of heavenly layes A consort sweet my sense betrayes, By organs of mine Eare, allayes All mind-remording cares. Aboue time, motion, place, which raise My ravisht thoughts, to heare his praise Proclaimde which heauen's blest hosts amaze, By notes of Angels' ayres. O harmony transcending Arte! Of which the hopes ease present smart; Thrise happie they who beare a part In this cœlestiall Quire. O blest Musitians most expert, Whose Ditties all delight impart, Whose hymnes exhilarate the heart, And entertaine the Eare! Of Ambrosie, of Nectar, streames, (Heaven's dainties hid in heathnish names,) An endlesse feast the Lambe proclaimes, To all the Saints above. The Saints refresht more with his beames Then worldlings with vaine pleasures dreams, O how desiderable seemes To Thine, this feast of Love! If beggars vile themselves hold grac't, At tables of great Kings to feast, With curious cates to please their taste, With choise of rarest things: O! what a heavenly sweet repast Doe Saints enjoy, which aye shall last, Who at immortall Tables plac't, Feast with the King of Kings. Of all these Millions which frequent This Paradise of sweet content, Perfumes most rare refresh the sent, From a perpetuall spring. Comforting oynments odours vent, Sweet'ning the heauens' transparent tent, Which flow from him his blood who spent His to blesse to bring. Which, (as in smell, taste, hearing, sight,) In feeling als enjoy delight, The Body changde, spirituall light, Apt euery way to moue; Nimble, as thought, to reach by flight, (Unwearied,) heauen's supremest hight, The Center low, from Zenith bright, As It the Minde doth move. By Motion swift, heere, Bodies tost, If thus endangered to bee lost, The feeling sense, affected most Participats most paine: What Joyes (to view this numbrous host) The Elementar regions crost, When both vnharm'd throgh heauen's way post, Shall then this sense sustaine? If Spasmes, if Palsies pincing throes, If Colick paines invade, (health's foes,) These torments Feeling vndergoes, Most sensible of griefe, Now when sequestred from those woes, Which marre lifes vnsecure repose, How shall this sense, set free, rejoyse, Exult at its reliefe? But euen as one, (more bold than wise,) A Pilgrimage doth enterpryse, O're Atlas' tops, which hid in skies, Crownde are with Winter glasse: Hudge Mountains past while hee espyes, Impenetrable Rockes arise, Forc't to retire, his course applyes By smoother paths to passe. So, while aboue the Spheares I prease, Steps not by Nature reacht, to trace, The clowds to climbe with halting pace Lets infinite impeach. Those reachlesse Ioyes, this boundlesse peace, In number, measure, weight, encrease: That scarce begunne, my song must cease, These hights transcend my reach. ????? ???? ???. FANCIES FAREWELL Son. 1. [Too long, my Muse, (ah) thou too long didst toile] Too long, my Muse, (ah) thou too long didst toile, An Æthiopian striving to make white; Lost seede on furrowes of a fruitlesse soile, Which doth thy trauells but with Tares acquite. Hence-foorth fare-well all counterfeit delyte, Blinde Dwarfling, I disclaime thy deitie, My Pen thy Trophees neuer more shall write: Nor after shall thine arts enveigle mee. With sacred straines, reaching a higher key, My Thoughts aboue thy fictions farre aspire: Mounted on wings of immortalitie, I feele my brest warmde with a wountless fire. My Muse a strange enthusiasme inspires, And peece and peece thy flamme in smoake expires. Son. 2.

Plungde in the tyde of that impetuous streame, Where fynest wits haue frequent naufrage made. O heavenly Pilote, I implore thine aide!

Look on thy labours: timouslie lament: Trees are hewde down vnwholesome fruits bring foorth. Thy younger yeares, youthes sweet Aprile mispent, Strive to redeeme with works of greater worth. Looke home, I say, make haste: O shunne delay: Hoyse sayle while tyde doth last: Time posts away. Finis. THE Trve Crvcifixe for True Catholickes or The way for true Catholickes to have the trve Crvcifixe God is a Spirit and they that worship Him must worshippe Him in Spirit &amp; in truth. Iohn 4. 24 If sacred 2 Thes. 11. 12.Truth did not conciliate trust, My doubt remoue by satisfaction just, But muse I could not, how from time to time, Man, ( Gen. 2.but a masse of animated slime, A cloud of dust, tos'd by vncertaine breath, A wormeling weake, soone to stoupe downe to death,) Durst bee so bold, his pow'r as to enlarge; And 2 Command, Levit. 26. 2. Psal. 97. 7.(proudly vilipending God's discharge) A frantick freedome to himselfe durst take, An Image for religious vse to make. It is strange that m? should call the worke of their owne hands. And now I can not halfe enough admire, How fondlings ( Levit. 10. 1. daring offer vncouth fire) The naughtie issue of a noysome seed. Agnus Dei and Crucifixus, Christ his proper stiles, and ascribe such virtue as flows from Christ his person to them, and trust and leave and giue religious worship to th?, and yet plead to passe free of Idolatrie. Like errour yet should to lyke madnesse lead, Christ of his honour due induc't to reaue Vnto their owne inventions, it to giue A peece of abject waxe, clos'd in a clout, For God's lamb, blushing not to beare about: Nor (sense distracted) Christ's owne proper stile, Agnus Dei, is as much as the lambe of God. The Crucifixe, forbearing to defile, Crucifixus, as Christ nailed on the Crosse. It attributing to their Christs of drosse, (A man's faind shape, fix'd on a fancied crosse) With honours, stiles, and titles, not a few, To crucified Christ Jesus, only due. To 1 Cor. 2. 2. Paule no Crucifixe besids was knowne, God's Spirit calleth Christ himselfe the crucifixe, and nothing else. Saue Christ. Mat. 16. 16.Sonne of the living God alone: This crucifixe of His, our Isa. 40. 9.God, our Iohn 20. 28. Isa. 43. 11.Lord, By all should be obey'd, serv'd, lov'd, ador'd. Our harts for Him, whose heart for vs did bleed, A rowme should bee to rest in, and reside. Hee should our glorie, Gal. 6. 14. 2 Cor. 10. 17.our rejoycing bee, Wee 2 Cor. 4. 11. Ibid. 5. 16.liue to Him, who chusd for vs to die. His image in our lyfe we all should beare, Walking as Hee, Philip 2. 15.pure, innocent, sincere, Our Gal. 5. 14.flesh, our soule affections mortifying Heere, to be His for ay, Mat. 16. 24.our selues denying.

Luke 18. 28.for Him, with each thing els to twinne Wee labour should, while heere wee borrow breath, In bleeding hearts 2 Cor. 4. 10.to beare about his death. To this intent, in pure Truth's sacred booke, No right nor lawfull resemblance of Christ crucified but such as Himselfe hath made. Our dayly task should bee on Him to looke; To Iohn 5. 39. Isa. 8. 20.search the Scripturs, which of Him record, And crucified before our eyes afford. We should those holy ordinances haunt, His Sacraments, means which Himselfe did grant, And Registred left in His latter will, His death to keepe in fresh remembrance still: And with a longing soule and listening eare, The Gospell's joyfull tidings bent to heare, Such wee should bee, 1 Cor. 2. 2.as knowledge all hold vaine Saue Christ to know, and for our sinnes Him slaine. Thus Gal. 3. 1.Paul him suffering to all eyes exposd, Which 2 Cor. 4. 3. 4.misbeliefe and ignorance not clos'd, Thus may wee all Him by faith's piercing eye In God's Word and ordinances Christ may be seene as in a mirrour. In Glasse of his owne institutions see; Thus bee preseru'd from following Christ-lings vaine Shewd in the juggling trickes of wits prophane, Which Numbers lead astray; amongst which crew No doubt but chosen soules are not a few; To whom cleare eyes God once to see will giue, As others, who did in like error liue, That meanes none els, Christ's knowledge can afford, But such, himselfe hath stablisht in his word. Thou knowst (sweete Christ) the pitifull respect, Those simple soules I beare which thee affect, And faine would find thee, but astray are ledde, With vaine inventions in man's fancie bredde, Who searching thee, cast in a curious mold Of baser mettle, or of purest gold, Worship to thee, vnwarranted allow, And basely to a lying idole bow, Intending thus to impetrat thy peace Doe loade themselues with sin, thee with disgrace With pittie mov'd, with indignation just, To such, a better pourtrate wish I must; Which to draw foorth, Lord furnish me with airt, Bee thou my Patrone, who my patterne art; My hand, my pinsell, let thy Spirit guide, That (all humane respects farre laide aside) Free from presumption curiously to trace Each subtile line of thy Immortall face. Thee shaddowing foorth, my draughts may not debord From sacred mirror of thy sauing word. Teach Thou my straines to flie no other flight, Still leade mee with the Lanterne of thy light, That with thy loue enflam'd, I may with feare, Thee in that Glorious mirror still admire: Where, to our measure, Thee abridg't we haue, Of Thee at least sufficient truth to saue. Yet so that what thou to reueale hast dain'd, A part can bee but of that part attain'd Which as Man's Soule thy Spirit doth empire, Some more, some lesse, none fully can acquire: The soberest measure, euen the least of all If thou vouchsafe, Lord serue my purpose shall. Man's prime felicitie and soveraigne blisse, 1. Man's happinesse stands in his c?munion with GOD. His onely chiefest good, which most doe misse, By combination of eternall bands, In his Communion with his Maker stands. This Vnion first spirituall must bee found: 2.

By disobedience, truly God to knowe, And Christ his Sonne, the source whence life doth flowe. God's Rebell 1 Pet. 5. 8.Sathan, man's malicious foe, Debard from grace, since first by pride brought low; Sathan therefore hath ever labored to mar man's knowledge of God that he might marre man's communion with God Depriud of happinesse, Apoc. 12. 9. Jude 5. 6.exild from Heaven, Hopelesse to be restor'd, to darkenesse driven, In malice set, by subtiltie and slight Man's happinesse to marre with all his might, Him from his God, and Soveraigne good to part, Striues, of his God the knowledge to pervert. In man (his Gen. 1. 26. Maker's image) God infus'd Man at his first makeing had sufficient knowledge of God given him by meanes appointed of God to moue him to keepe c?munion with his Maker. A light too glorious to haue beene abus'd, A Rom. 1. 19.Heavenly knowledge (forefault by his fall) Both of himselfe and things created all; In which faire volume Man might dayly looke, And exercise his witts, as in a Booke, Which him to reade, to studie did invite, God's boundlesse pow'r, his wisdome infinite. The Gen. 3. 5.Serpent offring to augment this light, But Satan by an vnlawfull meane offering to augment his knowledge bereft him of the benefite of that which he had. By greater knowledge to vnsile His sight; (For yet his eyes had still beene closde to ill, No wicked thoughts perverted had his will); Did vnawarres thus worke his ouerthrow, Sinne making him at once commit and know. Thus not alone by treason did seclude Himselfe from grace, lost God, his chiefest good, Rom. 5. 12.But guiltie made his offspring by his fall, Which puld in him the fruit which poysond all: Thus (Errour ruling Reason's sacred raigne) False Gods, Imaginarie Good did faine Iustly of skill, of will, of strength denude, To know, loue, follow, what was truely good. But O the bountie! O the boundles loue God after the fall brake vp the light of the restoring and saving knowledge of Christ in the promise of the incarnation of his word and wisdome. Of God, whom mercie no desert did move, Hee of his goodnesse willing to reclaime Those Rebells, objects vile of wrath and shame, Did with himselfe determine to bringe backe, And His, wretcht Man, by double title, make, Restoring him to more since his offence, Than he enjoyd in state of innocence: So bound himselfe by promise to this end Gen. 3. 15. A Woman's Sonne vnto the world to send, A Man in Wisdome, Majestie and Might, Equall with God, to frustrate Sathan's slight: The Serpent's heade to breake, his works destroy, Lost happynesse that man might re-enjoy. 1 Ioh. 3. 8. The father of deceitt, That lyar bold, But Sathan stroue by misbeliefe to debarre man from seeing this light. Now blinded Man in darknesse striues to hold, And, with his owne prevailing did pervert, Iohn 8. 44. And harden cursed Cain's cruell heart, Gen. 4. And such as hee, his misbeliving seede, God's faithfull word and promise to disside. To help man's weaknesse, God in offerings shew God appointed sacrifices and oblations as spectacles to helpe man's dimme sight to see Christ the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world. His holy Lambe set foorth to publicke viewe, Him outward figures shadowing beneath: To manifest the vertue of his death. The Devill of all their types the trueths did hide: But Sathan stroue to make men gaze on the speotacles only, and not looke through them to Christ. Man made vpon the outward worke abide: To set all labor'd (whom his sugred hooke, To swallow over he could moue to looke), Beyond the signes to their appointments end, That so for trueths men might on shads depend. God yet this mysterie to make more plaine, After the flood God made it yet more manifest that his Sonne should be a man incarnat by apparitions, and personall types. His Sonne for Man's redemption to bee slaine More clearly in the flesh to manifest, Good hopes to Man did giue, on which to rest, To Gen. 19. and 32. 24.mortall eyes presenting now and than, The World's Redeemer in the shape of man. Iosh. 5. 13. Now Sathan seeing hee did moyen lacke, But Sathan stroue to destroy this light by inuention of images in Sem's possteritie where the visible kirk was. Christ's comming in man's Nature to keepe backe, New slights assayde, and so his purpose wrought, That he, in Heber's house, (Sem's offspring) brought Compare Gen. 31. 30. with the 34 &amp; 53 verses of that cap.

From Gen. 12. 4.this contagious crew which thus did fall, God called foorth Abraham fr? the societie of Image worshipers.

Sathan's arts, by Egypt's foule infection, But Sathan so farre preuailed with the world by this bewiching device that everie age almost he ensnared by imagerie the people of God, Abrah?s offspring, till the captiuitie of Babylon. Here yet ensued anone a new defection, Till God brought foorth his people, did his law By his owne finger on two tables drawe, Midst flames promulgate; that no liuing soule His will presume should after to controule; Yet base imagerie, in such a sort, Corrupted man's conceat did so transport, That Iudg. 8. 33.

Hence Iewes (wee reade) did neuer image make, Loue, beare about, their God for such forsake, But as they did of the Messiah heare, Did to the ancient Prophecies giue eare. Yet Sathan's thoughts on evill ever fixd, When God had banished images out of his church, Sathan labored still to make man misconceiue the promised Messias so to mar the true knowledge of Him. Not ceassing his intent to follow, mixd With God's pure Truth traditions, not a few, Which lasted till our Lord did all make new; And 'mongst God's people, and peculiar race, For outward idols finding now no place, Wholly his slight extending, did neglect No meanes in minds an idole to erect: Of many, whom his subtiltie did make God's oracles, the Prophecies mistake, To dreame that Christ should bee an earthly king, To earthlings earthly dignities to bring, Their Eyes Mat. 13. 15.

Gainst this restoring of God's knowledge true, But Sathan stroue that man should looke onely on his bodily shap and not looke through the Vaile to his godhead dweling in the man Christ. Man to his God, in malice Sathan flew, And boldly dares renew the auncient warre, With envy swolne, this glorious worke to marre; He streight did stoppe Man's vnattentiue eare, That man should not His heavenly doctrine heare. With foggie mists, with sinne's thick clouds He blinds, 2 Cor. 4. 4. Mat. 13. 55. Mark 6. 3. The mirror darke of world-distracted minds, That they no further than his outside pierce, The glorious beames His Godhead did disperse, In all his actions dazling so their sight, That with weake eyes they might no view this light; But Him disvaluing, Them who dearely lov'd, Nor with His life, not works, nor wonders mov'd; Iohn 10. 38. They onely pore vpon His outward frame, Who in a seruant's shape most meanly came, Philip. 2. 7. Cladde with our Nature's imperfections fraile, Inwrapt (as seem'd) in sinfull fleshe's vaile, Rom. 8. 3. Whom viewing with the cloudie eyes of sense, No wonder that the world conceiud offence, That Hee who came the world to saue alone, Thus to the world did proue a Stumbling Stone. Rom. 9. 33. Isa. 8. 14. Thus did the Iews, thus Turks, thus Heathens fall. Thus Saracens, thus Machometans all, Rejecting Christ cause man's basse shape He bare, Ly taken in the craftie hunter's snaire. But Christ who came, lost mankind to reclame, Least this humilitie should marre his ayme, God in himselfe invisible to show, And manifest to Earthlings heere below, That Essence Infinit, Omnipotent, Most Good, most Glorious, most Excellent, Did wonderfully in His Heavenly brest, (Tho never but in motion) ever rest, Hee, his Apostles, Messingers divine, To remed this error, Christ remoueth his bodily presence &amp; causeth write His Natures, Offices, Wordes, Workes, life, death, and all that serued to salvation. Pen-men, in whom pure Trueth vnstain'd did shine, Inspyrd, as Hee did by His Spreit endite, His birth, lyfe, death and testament to write, So that (tho Atheists this wovne coate would rend, God's Word by heavenly inspiration pend,) What These, what His Evangelists record, Sweet straines, in sweetest harmony accord; Which holy ditements as a mirrour meete, Loynd with the Prophesies in Him compleet, Might serue His Glorious Image to present, To such as sought Him with a pure intent, To make Him truely to salvation knowne, To all that loue Him, ev'n to all His owne. In These His Pen-men whose skild pencill drew, Onely the outward shape &amp; lineaments of His face and bodie, He will haue conceilld and not written in scriptur. Not His adulterat, but his pourtrait true, In mirror of the Scriptures He imprents, Vntouched to leave His outward Lineaments, His bodies frame, the featurs of His face To Him but common with fraile Adam's race, Giues charge his person, properties to paint The world with His life, doctrine, death, acquaint, His Nature's offices, His wonders wrought, His suffrings, sayings; not omitting ought That to His praise, Man's profite might redound In all whats needefull to Saluation found, Which might our Faith confirme, our Loue inflame, Or paterne proue to which our Life to frame. And this our Lord did wiselie: for the sight, Of man's base shape, in Him, but dim'd the light Of God's perfection, and did onely show, The fraile infirmities from flesh that flow. And what of These, could the record haue wrought? The bodily sight of the lineaments of our Lord his face and bodie was a stumbling block to many that saw him: the rehearsall whereof in Scripture hee thought not expedient. What good His bodie's just proportion brought, Since, face to face injoyd, His living sight, As heere he did present an earthly wight, So little helpt the world in Him to view, Of God Invisible The Image true? At These the world did stumble: These espyde With nature's twilight, millions made to slide. These were the barke, through which (with pleasing strife,) Illightned eyes did view the Tree of life: These were the Caske, which peirc'd, sweet balme did yeeld That to an angrie God wretcht man conceild. These were the vaile the Godhead's beames did hide, In Him did dwell and bodily abide, Coloss. 2. 9. Which cloud to peirce, this Sunne which did withhold, Did all behooue, who view His Godhead would. These but the superfice, which cover did The richer substance of the Treasures hidde Of knowledge deepe, of wisedome most profound, Of vnseene graces, which in Him were found. Thus what of Christ was set to outward sight Christ's bodily shape did not show what a one Hee was, much lesse is the faind shaddow of that shape, fitt to show to vs what a one he either was or is. (While seene on Earth of Heaven to make vs right) His bodie's shape, His lineaments of face, The featurs choice, which Him did chieflie grace, Him to point foorth were equall in no sort, And what a one Hee was, to show came short: Againe, of what the Eye a-lyfe espyde, A lifelesse picture can no be denyed Yet short to come: for Painters doe not ayme The soule of Him, whose shape the hand doth frame To set in sight: They striue alone to leaue His Bodie's figure, whom they paint or graue, And that but for the present day or houre They did the Paterne see, but having pow'r, Time, wrinkled age still hastning by degrees, Their arte to mock, which mock mistaken Eyes. But these viue draughts whose Heavenly luster shine, The Scripture onely is a fitt mirror wherein we may gett a right sight of Iesus, and of what-soever is to bee knowne of him for confort and salvation. By arte most exquisite, in write divine Not superficially his shape doe show, But solidly make vs our Saviour know; Not as our Image, but as God's He bare, In our fraile Nature, Man as men wee are; Not in one Nature, but in both vnite, God-man conjoynd, a Sauiour compleet, Not in one act, one case, or one estate, But from his birth, even to His life's last date, From his descending to Earth's lower parts, The Virgin's wombe, this mirror bright imparts Him fully, till He suffering did ascend, At God's right hand to raigne, world without end. If Christ's true pourtrait truely then to see, He must therefore verse himselfe in Scripture who desires to see Christ and not to be deluded with conceats of a false Christ. Thou longst, the Scripture must thy mirror bee, The Spirit (heere) thy Lord, then yeeres more old, What one He should bee, ere Hee came, foretold, And, ere humanitie did Him invest, His purtrait wonderfully (heere) exprest, For vs not onely serving on the stage, But all the Elect, since the world's first age. The auncient Church did all in substance see, Know, loue, beleeve, enjoy, of Him what wee. Heere, as the Spirit in this mirror cleare, Him singled foorth, His sight, by faith sinceere, Did patriarchs all and Prophets so enflame, Iohn 8. 56. That in His day they joyd before Hee came. Loe! heere the Iewish Church by Moses' Law In the old Testam?t you shall see Christ described as the Faithfull before His comeing saw him. Conveend, His suffrings in some measure saw, Him slaine for sinne, though dimly to their view The torchlight of their Sacrifices shew: On Him they weakly, yet with pleasure deepe, Through lattices of Typs, and figures, peepe, And (as they may) behold, from this dark cloud, The Mal. 4. 2.Sonne of righteousnesse Himselfe vnshrowd, That Ioh. 1. 29. Apocal. 13. 8.Lambe of God, that taks away sinne's staine, Ere world was made, who for the world was slaine, Feeding on Him their souls, as wee, by faith Thus to bee fred with vs, from endlesse wrath; Both 1 Cor. 10. 3.by one cuppe, by one spirituall foode Refresh'd, both sav'd by vertue of His blood. To see this ladder was to Gen. 28. 12. Iacob given, From Earth's low centre, reaching highest Heaven, Till Gen. 49. 10. Shilo came who cleerly did impart, The Scepter should from Iudah neuer part, Iob 19. 25. Iob liu'd perswaded, while most deeply grieu'd, That for his safetie his Redeemer liu'd. This Prince of peace, this counseller most wise, Isa. 9. 6. The Father euerlasting, Blessed thrise, A Child of wounder, euen the GOD of might, Israel's Glorie, and the Gentile's light, Luke 2. 32. Esay foretold (a Zach. 3. 8. Isa. 11. 1.branch of peerelesse worth,) From Iesses stemme, shall in the Flesh sprout forth, A King on whom the gouernement shall stay, Of all the world who shall the Scepter sway, A pow'rfull Prophet, by the Lord anointed, Good tydinges to the meeke to preach appointed, Who shall bind vp, not breake the bruised reed, Ibid. 42. 3. The weakely smoaking flaxe not quenche, but feed. See the 53 cap. which is full of cleare Prophesies of Christ. Isra'ls Sweete singer did his straines accord, All to set forth the Glorie of this LORD, Whom Hee a Priest for euer doth detect, Psal. 110. 4. After the order of Melchisedecke, Him doth point forth, now as expos'd to scorne, Psal. 22. 7. His hands and feet most pitifully torne, Psal. 22. 16. By lot his vestures parted, in his neede Ibid. 18. Made vinegar to drinke, on gall to feede, Psal. 69. 21. Constraind to crye, with sense of horror shaken, My God, My God, why hast thou Me forsaken? Psal. 22. 1. Now as victoriously on high ascending, Psal. 68. 18.

Of this Eternall, ever budding Braunche 1 Chr. 11. 17. To be raisd vp to David (who to quench, His burning thirst with Bethlem's streams did long) The Spirit spoke by Ieremia's tonge, Him setting forth a King, whose prosperous raigne Iustice and judgement should on Earth maintaine, Who Iudath save, who Israel should reclame, The Lord our Righteousnesse designd by name. In short, no age did revelatioun lacke, Christ the Messiah manifest to make From time to time, who by degrees of light, By Types or Prophecies was set in sight, Till from the Arke, the outward covering drawne, This glorious Day-starre in the flesh did dawne. Looke yet a little in this mirror rare, In the new Testament you shall see more clearely Christ revealed than the Prophets sawe Him vnder the Law. Predictions with accomplishments compare, With wonder ravisht, heere thou shalt behold All done, what earst was to bee done, foretold, Of Typs the clowdie Mysteries explaind, Shadows sequestred, reall Truths attaind, The legall rites, the ceremoniall lawe, By Him abolisht, who the vaile did draw, Of Christ affording a more liuely sight, A clearer knowledge, and a nearer light, So that the tenderest sight, the weakest eye, Him now vnmasked in this glasse may see. For now the Spirit (Moses' face vnvaild,) A Luke 2. 7. Babe presents Him, 1 Cor. 15. 54.death and hell who quaild, The Dan. 7. 9. Ancient of dayes a suckling weake, Who Rom. 1. 3.from His daughter's bowells birth did take, An Infant, Iohn 1. 1.coeternall with his Sire, Whose 1 Pet. 1. 12.Incarnation Angels did admire, Prizd by the foolish with contempt and scorne, Because a weakling of a weakling borne, In humble state, layd in a homelie stall, Luke 2. 7. To narrow bounds confind, who boundeth all, The comfort crauing of Her Virgine brest Who gaue Him birth (his wants by cryes exprest,) Borne and exposd at once to Tyrant's spight, Constraind His lyfe to saue by secret flight, The stormie flood of bloodie Herod's rage Mat. 2. 14.

Heere shalt thou see Him even while thus despisd, By Princes of the East, a Saviour prizd, His God-head who no sooner doe behold, But offering gifts of Incense, Myrrhe, and gold, Fall downe, adore, and to their LORD approue, Mat. 2. 11. Their faith, their hope, their loyaltie and loue. Pictures cannot describe that which the Scriptures speake of Christ his infancie. Since costliest Crucifixes, Picturs none, Since craftsman's skill on mettall, wood, nor stone, This can so liuely to the Eye present, As doth His written Word and Testament, Why fondly then prefer phantastick men The Graver's toole to the Apostle's penne? Hold on, thine eye fixe on His Youth's sweet spring, Luke 2. 46. Which doth faire buds of Pietie forth bring, Inciting tymouslie our tender yeeres To true devotion (since no act appeares, In which he provd to vs a President, The which was not for our instruction ment.) Heere thou shalt find Him in the Temple sett Luke 2. 46. 47. And Heavenly knowledge from His child-hood gett, Israel's doctours hearing Him demand, Who at His doctrine all astonishd stand, Ravisht to see, yeeres so vnripe admitt Such full perfection of a hoarie witt. But now, the Spirit doth invite thine eye Thy Saviour drencht in Iordan's streams to see: Loe, Luke 2. 21.Hee who formerly was circumcis'd, By His great Mat. 3. 13. Mark 1. 8.Harbinger must be baptiz'd: Thus sanctifying by those seales divine, The auncient Church, the Church that was to shine: Those actions His pure bodie must endure, Which should have force to clense our soules impure; Tho Him, Col. 2. 9.in whom (vnseene) the Godhead raignd, Nor Heb. 4. 15.filth, nor fore-skinne of corruption staind, So that, except for vs, the Lord of life, Did need nor streams, nor circumcising knife: Yet sinne for vs himselfe hee made, that wee, 2 Cor. 5. 21. In Him the righteousnesse of GOD might bee. Hence by the Spirit led, hold on thy pace, Mat. 4. Mark 2. 12. Luk. 4. 1. Thy Saviovr's footsteps to the deserts trace.

Who to assaile the Sonne of GOD was bold. Fullnesse of grace when thou in him dost see, Truth, mercie, pittie, loue, humilitie, All wisdome, meeknesse, patience, prudence, peace, Which in perfection but in him found place, Nothing can expresse Christ his growing age, &amp; variety of vertues except the holie Scripture. No wonder then this Mirror thee amaze, Since in no corner Thou heereof canst gaze Which doth no liuely set before thy sight A lanterne to thy lyfe, the Lord of light.

But you, (poore soules) beare not alone the blame, In others chiefly lyes the fault, the shame, Dumbe Doctors ceassing when for ease to preach, Or would not, or els could no people teach, Least men by vse should loath, at length despise Their often-mumbled matins did devise, Guyses to gaze on, showes men's soules to feed, An vncouth language for their dayly bread; To charme the Eare did mixe a sweete concent Of Melodie, by voice, by instrument, With choise divisions of an hundreth kinds, About to moue, and melt the hardest minds; Books turnd in blocks, blind dotards to delyte; If picturs did decipher the corruption of the doctrine and life of Churchmen als clearelie as the Scriptures do, they should bee in lesse request among the Roman Clergie. These, they were sure, would neither bark nor bite, For did they teach the Trueth, their faults expose, As Scripturs, which their lewdnesse doe disclose, They surelie should such intertainment lake, And (thrust to doores) the Scripturs' bonds partake, Which ly in fetters of an vncouth leid, Keept vp from sillie soules, which faine would read, Claspt by authoritie, that on this booke Saue privileged persons none may looke, Because in this engrav'd Christ's portrait true Is by the Spirit set to publike view, Plainely proclaiming, what doth them displease, Crying a Woe to Scribes and Pharisees, Faind Church-men, who pretend the saint to feed, Called blind guids.

Such doctrins as be these, not motiues least Haue beene, to bring dumb Idols in request, Christ's speaking purtrait such haue put to peace, (This stocks and stones admitted to outface,) But hearken thou, to his sweet voice giue eare, From His owne mouth, thou by the Sprit shalt heare The word of Trueth, Him powring foorth sweet streams Of living waters, to the soule that cleams Refreshment, feeling want, in feare to sterue, Such (heere) shall find, what may to saue them serve. O! view Him walking on the raging waues, Math. 14. 25. The winds rebuking, sinne's possessed slaues Mat. 8. 26. From Legions of foule Spirits setting free, Mark 5. 9.

The guilt, thy trembling soule lyes drencht beneath, By which if humbled, Hee shall comfort speake, Thy wounds bind vp, vnloade thy conscience weake, Invite thee with thy burden to draw neere, Offring for thee the Father's wrath to beare; Whom, that thou may'st from filth of sinne bee purg'd, Thou shalt behold arraign't, condemned, scourg'd, Sighing and groaning, with thy burden prest, Onely the scriptures expresse CHRIST his miracles and passion. Expos'd to paines which can not be exprest, Weeping, and bleeding, suffering death for thee. O Love! O Pittie, in a strange degree! Now in this combat entring Him behold Of his sad passion, tryed as purest gold By fire dissolv'd, in which no drosse is found, Deeplie afflicted, prostrat on the ground, Mat. 26. 37. The Garden watering with a Crimson flood, From all his pores distilling streams of blood, Luke 22. 44. His Glorye's beames obscurd, His Might allayed, His Courage seeming quaild, His Strength decayed; Crusht downe with weight of God's incumbing wrath, His guiltlesse soule made heavy to the death, Mat. 26. 38. Thy Crimes the cause, thy sinnes inunding speate, The meanes from Him which drew this bloudie sweate, Whom (notwithstanding) Hee did (so) esteeme, That all His suffrings did most pleasant seeme Thee, wretched wormeling, to redeeme from death, Perdition's heyre, sinne's slaue, the child of wrath; To thee the Father's favour to acquire, Not shrinking to drinke off the dregs of ire. These bee the suffrings, counterfits which scorne, The Popish crucifixe doth but mocke &amp; not expresse the sufferings of Christ. Which lyfelesse draughts deface, but not adorne. These be the suffrings which perplexed soules Most sensibly conceiue, sunk deep in scrouls Of tender bleeding hearts, The only way, Most liuelie felt which make his Torments may; Who (heere) the dolors of his death engrosse, Best feele the fruicts and comforts of his crosse. O wounderfull respect! O loue vnheard! O deare affection matcht with misregard! Loe, Hee who bought Man at so deare a rate, By Man is Mat. 26. 14, 15. Mark 14. 10. Luk. 22. 3.

See how Hee doth His forwardnesse represse, Mat. 26. 52. Who preasd, by arms, this offred wrong redreesse, And healing instantlie the harme receav'd, Yet did not mease the causelesse spight, conceau'd In hardned hearts so farre from grace, from loue, That miracle, nor favour them can move.

The Sonne of truth, incarnate to this end. That glorious Beame of vncreated light, By flesh and bloode invaild, hid from their sight, Thus all foretold gainst actors of this Ill, Against themselves do perfitly fullfill. O Earth! O ashes who thyselfe turmoylst, And with vindictiue flams of furie boylst, Tormenting others, darst revenge avouch, Vpon thy reputation's slendrest touch, See, with what patience, with what silence deepe, While Iews disgrace vpon disgrace doe heape, Thy Sauiour to the Smiters giues his backe, Esa. 50. 6. Doth from the Nippers not his cheeks keepe backe. Mat. 26. 67. To shame, to spitting, doth expose his face, The path not only pointing thou shouldst trace, But treading euerie steppe, hath taught the way, From which t'is shame, yea dangerous to stray. Loe in this hight of scorne, depth of disgrace, Isa. 53. 7. With cheare vnchang'de he dares his foes outface, Act. 8. 32. Yet from his lips not one intemperat word, If 10000 pictures were forged, they shuld all come short in showing that which the new Testament declares of Christ crucified. Yet Christ's Testament is in small estem with many in comparison of a fond &amp; fals picture. The BIBLE sets not so well as the crucifixe doth where poperie prevailes. His mercilesse tormenters doth remord. Christ's Testament which these and all contains, That Hee did suffer, shame or outward paines, Needfull for Thee to know in one small Booke Is found, on this in steade of pictures looke: This beare, this weare, this reverentlie reade, When read, at least attentiuelie take heede, This doth make known the Will, the legacie, Which thy deare LORD a-dying left to thee. With this love-token Hee remembred hath, Each loue-sicke soule to Him betroathd by fayth, His loue thus showne, to kindle loue againe, That mutually love wee might intertaine; If Christ thy loue be, then what hee hath left Nor let by wrong nor violence be reft, But striue to know what written for thy well, With's owne deare blood thy louing Lord did seale. See our true Samson yeelding now at length, Iudg. 16. 16. Spoild of the hayres of his vnmatched strength, A bloodie butchrie suffering for thy sake, Stript naked, torne with whips, faint, pale and weake, Mat. 27. 28. The Souldiours mocking His enfeebled might, Combining, in His torment, sport with spight, His offices all branding with reproch, With blasphemie Him charging, they encroch Luk. 25. 32, 37.

But ah! behold He comes: O heavie sight, Bright Eye of Heaven, O now shut vp thy light; Salt fountains all of tears be now enlarg't, Weake Isaak's tender shoulders (loe) are charg't, Gen. 22. 6.

From pressing loade of that disgracefull Tree, The means appointed of his death to bee; See, faintlie staggring, how He grones beneath The pondrous weight of God's incumbent wrath. O see the bloodie banner now display'd, The Sonne of God by Souldiours disarayed, Cladde only with our sinnes, in Garments red, The vine-presse of the Father's Ire doth treade, Esa. 63. 2, 3. Fixt to the crosse, his hands, his feete transpierced, Exposd to paine, to horrors vnrehearsed, His gratious armes foorth streatching all the day, To rebells walking in an evill way. Rome 10. 21.

Graves backe to light their sleeping guasts doe send, Ibid. 52. And loe, while ev'n his life's last spunke is spent, The Temple's vaile is to the bottome rent. See, now through tears, how He himselfe presents Col. 2. 14. Nailling vnto his Crosse Thy oblishments, Cancelling those Inditements which did tye God's wrath in iustice Thee to vnderly, Resoluing more by sinning, to abstaine Heb. 6. 6. To crucifie The LORD of life againe; On his owne death, who freelie of his grace, Rom. 3. 23. Did ground thy life and euerlasting peace. THIS, and what more to search for, thou aspires, In short their is no thing thou needst to know of Christ but all is in His testament. What faith can wish or what thy soule desires, The Spirit in this mirrour shall disclose, And to thy sight of Him as much expose, As may thy soule heereafter serue to saue, And guide thee (heere) with comfort to the graue, Except His inward vertues thou neglect, And but his outside carnally affect. This, God hath thought vnnecessare to show, This farre vnnecessare for thee to knowe; Sufficient that, which These who knew Him best, And best did know to make him knowne, exprest Haue left, enregistred in holy write, Which They did penne, God's Spirite did endite. Thus hath the Lord his will most clearelie showne, Luke 16. 29. By other means refusing to bee knowne These who saw Christ with their bodilie eyes knew him not to be that Christ till hee opned their eyes to behold him in the scriptures. Then by his word alone, where faith's bright eye, His hidden graces may most liuelie see, So that (except this way) no knowledge true, Accrest of Him, vnto the outward viewe Of These, admitted in his humane state, To touch Him, ev'n with Him to drinke, to eate. THIS being then the course by God prescriv'd To Man, of other means of grace depriv'd, To know the Sonne, and in the Sonne the Sire, The Sonne, concealler of the Father's Ire, Col. 1. 19, 26. O judge what Spirit this great worke to marre, Christ to make men know him hath set foorth the Scriptures and hidden his bodilie shape. But Sathan strives by me?s of the Roman Clergie to expresse his bodilie shape which can not show Him and suppresse the scriptures which might make Him knowne. This course to crosse, the Scriptures would debarre And hide this Mirror from the longing sight Of Soules, which faine would see this Sunne of light, Enjoyning such, this knowledge to attaine, By pictures false, or some resemblance vaine Of that externall shape, which God did hide, Least any in this fruitlesse search should slide? No Spirit doubtlesse els, but Hee, whose slight Seeks GOD and Man, to seuer day and night, With envy boyling, at man's good who griev'd, Hath ay a lyer and a Murtherer liv'd; Gen. 3. 6. His point for once who gayning, seeks yet still, To disconforme man to his Maker's will; Even Hee, who since his fall, with wondrous art, From GOD'S true worship man did still divert, By whom to such prophanenesse mortals driv'ne, 2 King 23. 5. Haue worshipt Sunne, Moone, Starrs, the host of Heaven; 1 King 11. Iudg. 6. 25. Ibid. 3. 7. 2 King 23. 5. For Moloch, Milcom, Baal, Ashtaroth, Who made the nations God's true worship loath; Who Images of GOD, hath oft devysd, And Men's deluded fantasies entysd A furtherance in GOD'S seruice to conceat, By means engendring his eternall hate; Thus Aaron did the golden calf erect; Exod. 32. These vain surmises Micah did infect. Iudg. 27. A house of GODS, a Levite to his Priest Who having This of blessings held no least; Of the Messias who possest Man's braine The error of Christ his earthly Kingdome was so commonlie receiued that the Apostles were possessed with it &amp; not delivered of it till after the Resurectioun. Act. 1. With fond conceats, Imaginations vaine Before Hee came, that when in humble state, Not seconding their expectation great, Hee did a servant's shape assume, whom they Conceiv'd, the scepter of the world should sway, An earthly Monarch, a triumphing King, Who by resistlesse force should freedome bring To their subjected state, Himselfe oppose To tyranizing pride of conqu'ring foes, Whom finding Other then they did surmise, With strong delusions led, the world agrees, 2 Thes. 2. 11. The true Messias cruellie to kill, Expecting their fore-fancied Saviour still: Although our LORD, inviting oft there view, In Scriptures to behold his paterne true, Which, holy Prophets livelie had exprest, Ere fleshe's vaile His God-head did invest, Yet He, this Glasse who hid, their eyes did sile: His guiltlesse blood must needs their hands defile. The same is Hee who trauells in excesse, Yet from the world the Scriptures to suppresse, And from the knowledge true of CHRIST, therein, The world debarring keeps the world in sinne: Cous'ning poore people by deceitfull slight, Of paynters arte, affording false delight, Filling their hands, robt of God's sacred word, With pictures, from their paterns which debord, Which bold blasphemers, destitute of shame, Now Christ, the holy Crucifixe now name. What Spirit els, except GOD'S auncient Foe, Would striue to hide what God hath meant to show? Or who, except alone that Spirit bold, That dare raike vp, which God ly buried would? What Spirit els the world to looke would let In that pure Mirror, whence faint soules might get Refreshment, by the sight of Him alone, Who in His word is seene, is rightlie knowne? Who els would sweate the multitude to leade, By lying Images, GOD'S peace to pleade, By which the world is rather led astray After dumb Idols in damnation's way? Iudge then whom These, who willfull Agents bee, Patrons prophane of this impietie Antichristian hatred &amp; the Spirit of Sathan may bee seene in these who blaspheme the scripture, for if any man at Rome should say but the same of all the popes writtings and the writtings of popish doctors which they say of the holie Scripture, hee should bee streight way declared an enemie to the kirk of Rome, and put to death for a deuilish heretick. Doe serue, who superstitiouslie maintaine This forg'rie, Man in darknesse to detaine, The Romane Clergie, who of pow're too weake, The words pure light to make the world forsake By craft doe cast about another way To dimme the luster of this Lamps cleare Raye, The holy Scripture branding with disgrace, Which to traditions they but second place, Making the world It, with a just neglect, Corrupt and poysond in the source suspect, Imperfyte, and in vulgare tongues to bee Translated, needlesse, not from danger free. Thus from foule mouths maliciouslie they spew, Aginst the Scriptures not aspersions few, Furthering the world (so farre as in them lyes), GOD'S word as hard, yea hurtfull, to despyse, Yet CHRIST'S pretended Image on the Crosse, Their leaden braines with superstition grosse Doth so distract, that This, they madly seeme, To honour more than Him did them redeeme, To which they teach, as Christ's Resemblance true, Religious worship, yea divyne is due, Yea that same worship, which to CHRIST they owe, If Hee Himselfe did personally showe.The suppressing of the common reading of the Scripture makes such way to all errors, that the Romane clergie rules securelie and rainges over all kingdoms, co?tries, and commounwealths, while they get place over King's crowns, men's consciences, their soules, bodies, lands, rents, and movables, and all at their pleasure. The Scripture thus defended from the Lay, Traditions vncontrold fynd patent way, Their canons, constitutions, Popes' decrees, False definitions, legends stuft with lyes, Doctrines deboarding from the written Word With Scripture equall credite thus afford, Yea of the Scripture thou mayst nought beleeue, But in what sense the Pope is pleasd to giue: Thus, to the blinded world's astonishment, Their Lying wonders with beleife they went, Thus from the People they their Errors hyde, Which, by the sharper sighted if espyd, The word withdrawne, their labour lighter is, To make them thinke they did decerne a-misse. Thus must the People found their fayth on trust, For as their Church-men, so belieue they must. This fyner threed doth to their arts-men giue, A net of merits, of good works to weave, By which they fish, (from such as may be brought, To apprehend that Heaven may thus bee bought, With excesse to maintayne Those who have charge, Of convents, cloisters) Rents, dotations large, And if this fully doth no worke their end, A larger Net of Pennance they extend, From which to bee exem'd, they waird, they watch, The Rich-ones by Indulgences to catch, Who by their purse chuise rather to bee purgt, Then fast from flesh, then suffer to bee scourgt. But if some Fish, free from the danger leape, And both the one and other doe escape, To bee assur'de then both of poore and rich, A Hose-nett they of Purgatorie pitch, By which they seaze a-like on each degree; Heere Great ones stick, yea not the Fire go free; All, by the doctrine which these Clerks do found, Vngratious, yea vnnat'rall must be found, (At death at least) except with minds devote, Allowance, in some measure, they allote, Some kynd remembrance, Masses to maintaine, Soules to set free, from purgatorie's paine. Thus do those Glow-wormes which but shine by night, The substance of the world suck vp by slight, By shows of holynesse, by secreet stealth, Congesting mountaines of entysing wealth, To which, as Ravens which doe a Carion see, Trowps of Church-orders, swarms of Shavelings flie, Of which none idle, all on worke are set: By Cous'ning miracles, some doe credite get, To Cristen bels, tosse beads they some appoint, Some crosse, some creepe, some sprinkle, some anoynt, Some hallow candles, palmes, crisme, ashes, wax, Some penitents admitt to Kisse the Pax; And while this crew in these imployment wants, They multiply both male and female Saints; A severall Church they to each Saint allote; By raysing Altars they must seme devote, In one Church diverse, to a diverse end, Which men enabled with new meanes must tend. No wonder then they vrge a strict restraynt, Of Scripture, Seene, which would the World acquynt With these Imposturs, damnable deceats, Indang'ring vnder trust, so great Estates, Which if they licenc't were God's Word to view, Should doubtlesse bide those forg'ries all adiew. For Images looke what did set on fire Act. 19. 24. What earst did kindle the Ignoble Ire Of that Ephesian confused crew, Popish crucifixes bring more gaines to the Popish craftesmen and Clargie, than the Images of Diana, or any idoll to the craftsmen of Ephesus. All in a Mutinous concurse which flew, While of this Monster the seditious Head, Demetrius for Diana's shrines did plead. What motives then did these incense, the same, Place now for their Imagery doe clayme, Them stirring vp more turbulent, how much Their trade doth breed them greater gayne, then such. For but the mettel's worth and craftsmen's paynes, Did breed Ephesians answerable gaynes, But of their Picturs what the eye espyes, 'Tis nought; their worth in forme nor matter lyes, These valued are, on these the world doth doate, As Church-men holinesse to them alloate, As sacred vertue Men in them conceave, Which Pope or Prelate, at their pleasure gave, Thus by conceit, the Simple to entyse, These by opinion, not by worth who prise. Thus doe they farre those Silver-smiths out-flee, In witty traffiquing, in policy, Masking their avarice with greater slight, Than these who sold but what they set in sight, Their consecrated Crucifixes be Most prisd for their supposed sanctitie. But this in mee moves greatest admiration, It is strange that their being so many pretended Crucifixes, and sensible differences betuixt everie one of them, yet men will beare it out that every one of them ar purtraits of Christ. Tho every day bring foorth a new creation Of these false pictures, an adulterat brood, So that in number, number they exclude, Yet all of them, though of a diverse frame, Each diffring from another, boldly clame, Christ vively to exhibite to the eye, Stretcht foorth to death vpon an abject tree; So that, it seems more CHRISTS they either make, Or CHRIST doe for the damned thiefe mistake, Sith neither Graver's toole, nor Paynter's arte, Doe other difference, saue in thoght impairt, Yet howsoeuer, whether This or that They doe resemble, all of them they rate, And doe in as high estimation hold, (Though infinite in number) as of old, Ephesians did their One Palladium prise, Which they did fancie Iove sent downe from skyes. CHRIST'S purtrate thus in Scripture is supprest, The Bible serues not for Poperie as fained Crucifixes doe and theirfore sell the worse, yea are thrust out of the Market. Lest their abuses It should manifest, And lying Pictures in its place are thrust, Yet vnder colour of a reason just, Since Images (say they) by silent speach, As bookes, the rude, the ignorant doe teach, Since Scripture to the vse of all, least free, Oft misconceiud doth lead to heresie. But who but poore deluded soules can trust, The pretense of Images serving for books to the Laicks answered. That Images, inventions but of dust, In teaching truth GOD'S sacred word doe match, That Scriptures serue but heresies to hatch? Shall Idols dumbe, be speaking Teachers prisd? Shall speaking scriptures be dumbe rules despisd? By Craftsman's arte on mettle, woode, or stone, Shall Christ more lively to the world bee showne, Then by Their dytments who did him behold, And left His words, deeds, life, &amp; death enrold? If holy write some impiously abuse, This to maintaine lewd heresies who chuse, Must guiltlesse soules, must people innocent, Of their offence endure the punishment? Thus should wee shunne the Sunne's conforting light, Which (happily) hath hurt some stairing sight, Thus losse the comfort of GOD'S creatures goode, Since some that poysons which is others' foode. If heresies (by which are most misled) In learned, but vnhallowed brayns are bred, Since hatcht, nor nurst by the simplicitie, Of vulgar braynes these deepe delusions bee, Why then doe holy harmelesse people smart, For heady Churchmen's fault, without desart? If Error (which wee should as death despyse), The 4 answere. Doth from not reading of the word aryse, Mat. 21. 16 &amp; 42. Mat. 22. 29. As CHRIST doth teach, why then (in Christ's despight), To keepe from erring smother they this light? But all that to their minds doth disagree, Is repute Error, held for heresie; Though Peter, Paul, or Prophet did perswade, Though Christ Himself affirmd the contrare hade, Their words must either not bee hard at all, Or vnder Popish dispensation fall To passe for Scripture, so a sense receave, In other meaning than the Spirit gave, A glosse the Text confounding quyte; because For Error all they hold that hurts their cause.The Scripture such a mirror to shew Christ that it changes the student into the liknesse of Christ while there he beholdeth him by fayth. The Mirror pure, in which Christ's face doth shine The Scripture is, that register divyne Of holy write, that sacred, saving Booke, In which our Lord hath licenct vs to looke, Where, if wee labour earn'stly for His sight, The skailes of darknesse which our eyes be-night, He doth remove, and maks vs clearly see With open face, the beames of Majestie, And true Beholders by a manner strange, 2 Cor. 3. 18. Doth peece and peece in His owne likenesse change, And in this study as wee progresse make, Wee of the Glory which wee see partake, Changt in our soules by Christ's renuing grace, Exod. 34. 29. As on the mount was changed Moses' face. Why doe they syle poore mocked peoples' sight, The impietie of suppressing the scripture. Christ's face from viewing in this mirror bright? Why hinder they faynt sin-chargt soules to see, Christ whom they search for, where hee found may bee? The Spirit's working which doth men renew, By means of this true sight, this inward view, The change of soules from sinne why do they marre, Why saving knowledge from the world debarre? What helpe can all their pow'rlesse purtraits make, From forger's fancie which doe fashion take, Truely to teach Christ's Naturs, Essence, Will, Or in Christ's Image men to change from ill? Shall Their false picturs, Crucifixes faynd, Popish Crucifixes doe marre the true knowledge of Christ and teach the people lies. Christ's Mirror bee (that sacred fountaine staind), In these or shall the Spirit men make see, Or what Christ is, or what themselves should bee. O three times impious! O blasphemous speach! These nought to lookers on but lyes do teach, And like themselves, their favourits they make, As heads they have, but vnderstanding lake, Psal. 115. 8. Ibid. 5, 6, 7, &amp; Psal. 135. 15. As mouths which speike no, feete which never move, As eyes that see no, yet doe set on love, And justly doe of wit, of sense bereave, Disciples all, such Teachers as beleave, Suffering themselues to bee debard the sight, Of holy write, which truely teach them might. Great is the miserie of man by Sinne, The Ignorance of GOD Man binds therin. Ephe. 4. 18. The way to freedome from these heavy bands, Christ's incomparable love of man's salvation hath set his wisdom (Luke 10. 22; Mat. 11. 27; John 17. 3) on worke to devyse the fittest means to make himselfe knowne to the world, and what his wisdome thought fittest for that end, his love hath mad him cairefully set downe in his testament, but no word of the lineaments of his face or shape of his bodie or pictures to expresse it. In God's true knowledge principally stands; God truely's knowne but in his Christ to none, And God in Christ who know fynd life alone. Now Christ, who onely GOD Himselfe who so, That man may GOD, Man must Himselfe make kno. The fittest meanes Himselfe to manifest, To His owne searchelesse Wisdome knowne are best. Hee knows what neede wee of this knowledge have, And how without it nothing vs can save, And how the losse of Mankynd he doth beare, Doth by His Death, to bring vs life appeare. His loue to saue vs, Him who did despise, Did set on worke His wisdome to devise, All Meanes which of Himselfe the knowledge pure And so of God, might to our soules procure, And so in him bee reconceild, so fred From wrath, so to eternall life bee led: And what His Wisedome for our well devisd, His constant care, in holy write comprisd Hath left, the Meanes thus setting in our sight, Which of Himselfe the saving knowledge might Sufficiently disclose; Meanes onely meet To make Him knowne, Meanes in themselues compleet, Without the forg'ry hatcht in humane braine Of lying pictures, Crucifixes vaine, Which for His knowledge Hee hath thought vnfit, Since mongst His Meanes these He doth not admit. Thus hath Hee not the Means alone prescriv'd, Which point Him foorth (Means in His Word contriv'd). But all doth charge, who warm'd are with His loue, And Means to make Him rightly knowne would proue, To search the Scriptures, if for life they looke; In all men's hand Christ puts this saving Booke: This, Hee doth warrant, to eternitie, A constant witnesse of Himselfe to bee. But Picture-mongers, mad Demetrius' heires, Vnlawfull gayne to make of worthles wares, By other Means then Christ, to lead to Heaven, New bookes haue fayned, new directions given. Poor simple Laikes (they in substance say), Therefore the skarring of people from the Scripture, and putting in their hands Images &amp; pictures vnder whatsoever pretence, is a chalenging of Christ, either as witlesse or lovelesse or cairelesse who did not recommend in his testament such a meane as they aledge the artificiall crucifixe to be. By searching of the Scriptures erre yee may, Pictures are plaine, these harmelesse bookes doe show What needfull is for you of Christ to know, In Scripture darke 'tis dangerous to prye, Such curious search concernes not you to trye. Thus impudently teach the world they dare, That both vnfit and vnsufficient are CHRIST'S Means; their owne devices more import The well and safety of the weaker sort. Thus argue they of Ignorance our LORD, The Means most fitting, who could not afford; Of Envie, means who would not recommend, Which choysen, most might to our safetie tend; Of Carelesnesse, sith He forgot to give Charge, in his Latter-Will these meanes to leave. For peoples Well thus will they seame to be More Wise, more Loving, Carefuller than Hee. What else is this, by a pretence to teach Christ's knowledge, but Christ's knowledge to empeach, By faining a false Christ, to barre the way By which the True attayne wee only may, Who, not attaind, God neither can wee know, Since God in Him alone Himselfe doth show? Thus are the bonds of Man's most wretcht estate By Nature, straitned by the Devil's deceate. Let civile Images, for civile vse Albeit civile Images for civile vse bee lawfull, yet no religious Images of man's device for religious vse are lawfull. Haue place, we challenge only the abuse. That paynter's Pencil pleasure doe impart Wee hinder no, let craftsmen vse their arte: But howsoever humane wit debord, God in Religion must alone bee Lord. Exod. 19. 18. While from Mount Sinai Hee the Moral Law The 2 comm?d of the first Table which is the Law for religion expresly forbids religious Images of man's device. Promulgate did, (where Him no mortall saw) Incompast all about with flames of fire, As Royall Roabs which Majestie attire, Hee, onely as His owne Prerogatiue, Did, of Religion, plead the Rule to giue, And Man, (with vaine presumption swolne), at large Madly with This to meddle doth discharge, Binding His hands, by words expresse and plaine, Deut. 4. 15. Exod. 20. 22. Of Him, no foolish Counterfit to faine, We may make a Image which resembles Something, but not an Idole which resembles Nothing sayes the Papist: No says the Lord, you shall not make the liknesse of any thing in heaven &amp;ct. Deut.4. 23. No Image, for Religious vse, to make, Of ought, in Heaven or earth did being take; Nor made, to honour, with the least respect, Save They with Him their Covenant would breake, Kindling gainst them His iealousie most just, Rankt as Adult'rers, (from His service thrust) Who, worship with Him, or besyde Him, gave, To others, due for Him alone to have. Thus God hath banisht, from Religion's bounds Exod. 23. 24, &amp; 34. 13. This worship vaine, His worship which confounds, All vse of Images, by Man devysd, To God Man hatefull rendring and despysd. But Hee who doth exalt Himselfe to raigne, 2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. Of Princes all Monarchick Soveraigne, Why may not the people and the Church apoint Images sayes the papist. I am the Lord says God, that is it is God's Royall prerogatiue to apoint the meanes of his owne Honour. That Man of Sinne, perdition's Sonne, the slave Of Sathan, yet pretends Christ's place to have, Dare gainst this Law most impudently stand, And God's great VETO boldly counter-mand. Of GOD, of Man, he images dare make, Thus Mocketh Christ, even suffring for our sake: Why may wee not give some Religious worship &amp; honour to Images sayeth the papist. I am a Ielous God sayes the Lord, that is, Religious worship is due only to God the husband of the Church, whatsoever is given to another is adulterie, that is Idolatrie &amp; provoks God's Ielousie. To these, Religious worship Hee allowes, And This their Due most shamelessly avowes. Whyle of this Rav'ry wee a reason crave, O how themselves they willfully deceave! The custome of their Fathers They pretend, The love of GOD, of CHRIST, this is the end Why they Their purtraits reverently respect, Whose persons They so dearely did affect, But O weake shifts! pretences worthy tears! Our forefathers vsed Images sayes the papist. I will visit the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children sayes the Lord. Evasions serving more to mocke the eares, Of simple Hearers, than this Error vaine With meanest show of reason to maintaine. We make and honour Images out of loue to God, sayes the papist. They hate mee that keepes not my commandem?t sayes the Lord. God's Law most clearely these detects: the same Excuses for this foolishnesse they frame Which clearely are condemnd (shifts farre amisse), In that Command which Rankt the Second is: Which, God of purpose, gainst this Sinne did place, When the Church of Rome scraipt out the 2 command out of the vulgare books &amp; made two of the 10 command, they saw that their Images could not abyd the assise of God's law. This wickednesse so staring in the face, That when heereof, they can not stand in sight, Accusd, convinct by their owne conscience light, To burie it from vulgare eyes they striue, And this of place amongst the Ten depriue, Braunching the Tent in twaine; to hide the thift, Vsing a shamelesse sacrilegious shift, Least seene the people should these snares forsake, Layde (doubtlesse by the devill) their soules to take. Thus, though our Lord, as a religious Meane, To elude God's Law Image lovers haue vsed as (they yet vse) many pretences, but notwith-standing of them all, God reiects this invention, refuts it, condemnes and curses both it and the maintainers of it. Condemned hath to Images to leane, Yet still doe Image-doatars God's decreit Striue to make Irrite, as vnjust, vnmeet, Thus pleading profite to the Simpler sort, Who come of knowledge by the Scripture short But by the Eye inform'd, are brought in mynd, Of what by These they represented fynd. But harke O fondling, who thy God dost faine, God by his Spirit cals this custome vaine. Ierem. 10. 3. Those creatures of thine owne, nor care, nor feare Thou needst, which Thee can neither see nor heare. How foolish they who doe on such depend, Ier. 10. 8. Which neither Friend can help nor Foe offend? v. 5. The Stocke which God they to resemble frame, v. 8. Doth doctrines but of vanity proclame. These perish shall from Earth, from vnder Heaven, v. 11. Their Founders to confusion shall bee driuen, Whose arte but Error serves to vnderproppe, v. 14. Whose worke is falshoode, forgt in Sathan's shoppe. This foolish Toy, this hell-devised slight, Men charming with a naturall delight, Loe, GOD doth scorne, the workman's fruitlesse paynes, The zeale poore people which hood-winkt detaynes, Him seeking whose pure worship they professe, By some Resemblance fondly to expresse. Is. 40. 18, 19, 20. GOD to a dispute challengeth in end, Isa. 4. 20. Such as dare graven Images defend, Deluded soules and blinded by deceate GOD proves them, who transported with this spaite Of madnesse, basely doe crouch downe before The crafts-man's worke; which ought to have no more Respect, then as much mettell, timber, stone, Appointed for the basest vse, or none. Is. 44. 9, 10. Hee laughs to heading their conceats, to see, What lavish chairges spent in Making bee, In Consecrating, what obsequious care, What Superstition, straitning Sathan's snaire, What base Devotion madly they bequeath Vnto their Idoles, which (tho voyde of breath), On shoulders mounted they on high doe reare, And in ridiculous Procession beare. Isa. 46. 5, 6, 7. Let blind Idolaters with errors streame Transported headlong, vse and profite dreame, Isa. 44. 9. By these devices; God professeth plaine, Hee knows no profite by these Meanes profaine, Meanes to bee made vnworthy, Meanes to trust Intolerable; teaching lyes to Dust, Whence beeing they did take. The Curse of Woe, Of Vengeance, thundred foorth they vndergoe, Who Prayer's sweete perfume to such present, Hab. 2. 18, 19, 20. Whom words nor vows can with or wants acquent. Cursd by the Law, is Hee, who toole doth take Deut. 27. 15. Or grav'ne, or molten Image for to make, God thus abhominably to disgrace. Cursd, for devotion, who in secret place, The Crafts-man's worke, GOD'S worship to confound Set vp, the People all Amen resound. Harke, how the Prophet doth confusion threat, Psal. 97. 7. A Curse denunceth both to Meane and Great, That boast of Idols, Images doe serue. The reason why Such do this curse deserue, Saint Paule expresseth. For, from GOD estraingt Rom. 1. 23. His Glory Incorruptible, transchangt By them into an Image, made in all, Like Man corruptible, proclive to fall, They even GOD'S Trueth, have turned in a Lie, Rom. 1. 25. Ascribing worship, in more high degrie, Vnto the Creature subject to decay, Than the Creator, who is blest for ay. Yet notwithstanding all, Some dare avouch, Obiection. That while before a Crucifixe they crouch, But O sayeth the papist I find my affection stirred &amp; my devotion helped by Images &amp; namelie the artificiall Crucifixe. This pretence answered. Or on a well done Image fixe their eye, Their frozen Zeale they fynd enflamt to bee, Their half-dead Faith reviv'd, their faynting Loue To Christ, incitements wonderfull to prove, Passions of joy, of feare, of griefe increst, Fitting to further their devotion best, So, though the world, (they openly avow), Though all authoritie these disallow, Which in their brests such strange effects doe bread, And whence such motions of the Sp'rit, procead, They can not bee induc't, so much as doubt, But God aproves, even to be borne about, Sollicitously keept, devoutely kist, To bee falne downe before, these Means most blest, Means, of that worship worthy held to bee Even due to Christ; though not in like degree. But O Blind soules these folyes which frequent, Affections and motions accompanying Image worshiping are but the whorish allurments of the spirit of idolatrie. If with GOD'S will yee truely were acquent, In holy write reveald, and did believe, These Means suspition should not faile to give; Thus narrowly yee should that Serpent's slight Examine, in an Angel changt of light, Cor. 15, 14. God's Spirit counterfitting, whose deceat, Vnder pretence of peace procuring hate, By bastard Motions of the minde doth make, Deluded soules grosse Lyes for Truths mistake. 'Tis most absurd, even in the least degree, To thinke God's Word and Spirit disagree, This, striving to restraine and stop the way, That, grounds to this impiety to lay. God's holy Spirit by no other Meanes Doth worke, but such as God Himselfe ordaines, Whatever superstitious potards dreame, Forbidden Meanes He hates; and these by name. A contrair Spirit then This hold wee must, Insinuating Himselfe to settell trust In the deluded soules of such, as find Such seeming-sacred-Motions of the mind, Warming with woontlesse flames their frozen hearts, Enveigling man's conceit with wondrous arts. These (doubtlesse) must the whoorish Motions bee, Even of the Spirite of Idolatrie; The fire of worship false; entysing traines Layd by that crafty Foe, who spairs no paines Wretcht Man to make vnlawfully delite In what GOD most condemns, in sacred write. Such were the Motions Jewes made daunce for joy Exod. 32. 19. Deut. 9. 21; Exod. 32. 20. 1 King 13. Before the Calfe, which Moses did destroy. Such, made the Prophet by those Tribs contemnd, In Dan and Bethell, who their calues condemnd. Such earst (wee reade) was the deluding dreame, Made Micah happy in his owne esteeme. Iudg. 17. 13. Such vncouth flames made men the Temple leaue Worship to Deut. 7. 5; &amp; 12. 3. Images in groaues to giue. Such zeale made Israelits of sense denude, Bathe Isa. 57. 5; Deut. 12. 31; Levit. 20. 1, &amp; 18. 21. Molech's Image with their children's blood. The Devill, who Them did to this madnesse driue As subtile now as earst, is yet a-liue: And still goth on, by all the craft hee can, From service of the Living God, fond man To tempt, Spirituall Whordome to commit With Idols dombe: who, destitute of wit With the inchaunting Motions of the minde Is charmd, in Scripture which no warrant finde. Though Motions follow not Means vsd in Faith Which for His service God appointed hath As men would haue, or in their hearts project, Yet such (wee find) haue ever good effect. But Motions which without God's Meanes doe worke Are still to be suspect: the Snaike doth lurk Beneath the blooming flowre: the deadliest blow Is to bee fear'd from a disguised foe. Who so, come by such Motions, can not flee By Sathan's snaires but must entangled be. By GOD'S Prophetick Spirit when inspird Isa. 53. 2. Isaiah Christ made (long ere seene) admir'd, Before Christ came Isaiah prophesied that Christ should neither have forme nor comlines for which we should loue him. There-fore the lying resemblance of our Lord's form in the artificiall Crucifixe must haue lesser force. Nor Forme, nor Comlinesse hee did foretell Should make His outward feature to excell, No beauty admiration to moue, For which, wee should Him or desire, or loue. And so it did succeed: for, who by sight Of His externall shape, Him knew a-right To bee the Christ, who Man to God conceald, Such thing of Him, nor flesh, nor blood reveald. Math. 16. 17. Since Christ's true lineaments set to the eye (Which any Painter could haue wisht to see) The bodily beholding of our Lord, So little force, or furtherance did afforde, To kindle Men's affections, or to draw Whom even the Princ'pall, not the Purtrait saw To His obedience; O what madnesse then What fury strange doth fill the braines of Men, With dreams deluded, fondly to conceate, That lying Pictures are of powre more great? That counterfites of His exterior frame, Zeale can make fervent, or with loue enflame? As greater vertue did from Picturs flow Then Person's presence they are set to show? Since of a Servant's shape, the outward sight, Which in the flesh did clowde Christ's Heavenly light Did, nor with Motions nat'rall, nor divine, Make men to loue, or seeke to Him, incline, Shall Motions by this Shap's vaine picture wrought Iustly, or nat'rall, or divine be thought? No certaine: else the Crafts-man's toole should proue On wood, or stone more forcible to moue Then God's owne hand, Christ's frame, and featurs true On superfice of humane flesh which drew. However Men conceate that Faith, by sight Faith in Christ is necessar, the seing of Christ bodily is not necessar, far lesse is the false counterfitting of his shape necessar. Is fostred; thus that loues decaying might Is quickned, yet Christ doth the blessing giue To such as haue not seene and doe beleeue. After the flesh Paul Christ refusd to know The artificiall Crucifixe is a fleshly meane to know Christ after the flesh which the Apostle doth reiect. Resolv'd Him thus no more, if ever so: How should these Means of knowledge then content After the flesh Christ made to represent? BVT, of these Pictures poysning not a few Naturall considerations of the art of painting, or graving, may show the artificiall Crucifixe to be but the mockage of the World. With Error, yet to take a nearer view, Each Image should bee like its Patterne made, From imitating which, it name doth pleade, And if heereof it no resemblance leaue, Beholders' Eyes it serues but to deceaue. The Painter then the Prototype must see, Which in his brest must first engraved bee Before his Pensill, with deserved praise, Can with its semblance ravisht Eyes amaze. The Shape, the Lineaments, the Features right His fantasie must apprehend by sight, His hand directing, as hee did conceaue, A viue impression to the Eye to leaue, Els both deluded is His simple braine And Men but mocked with an Idole vaine. For, of the Patterne if through Ignorance, A bleare-eyed Leah hee should draw by chaunce, A traytrous Iudas, being of intent Rachel's, or Peter's purtrait to present, Needs force the picture (yet) of that must bee Which it most liuely sets before the Eye. Though Hee His work should cristen with the Name Proper to that to make which was His aime, Yet must it bee that which it truely is, Not what proposd it was, though nam'd amisse. Tho with Apelles' skill, Men now should striue Pictures, procuring wonder, to contriue, If from the Patterne diffring, wrought by guesse, What serue they, fruitlesly but to expresse And (valued though with vndeserved worth) Conceptions but fantastick to set forth? Since these (however by opinion great) Yet births abortiue of some vaine conceate, What can they els bee but resemble thought, The fond Imagination them which wrought? Though Popish Church should authorize the Dead Church, Painter, picture, all to Error lead. For, as the braine the Patterne doth conceaue So doth the Image-Maker paint or graue: The Patterns faynd Idea, in his braine First must bee forg't, next the impression vaine Not of the Patterne, but of His conceate, (A fantasie, hatcht in his head of late) Finds on the Table, or the mettall, place, As arte can his Imagination trace; Thus, hold wee must each Image of this kinde, The first Resemblance of the craftsman's minde. The definition of an Image made by arte. How falsly then doth a mis-shapen masse Of mettall for our Saviour's Image passe? How fondlie men perplexe themselues to mixe Colours most fit to frame a crucifixe? Which when perfited by the best of arte The most accomplisht Crafts-men can imparte, In no respect with Christ resemblance hath, Triumphing on the Crosse o're Hell, o're death, No not so much as in His outward frame By lines which they to counterfit doe clame. For, nor the Paterne blessd the Crafts-man's Eye The artificiall Crucifixe hath no ground but the Craftsman's guesse, seing never one that drew Christ's purtrait saw the true Paterne. Christ's living face who did no living see, Nor saw He Any who could show by speach And of our Lord the features truely teach, But as conceate him ledde, hee boldly gues't, And, as the Blind-man casts his staffe, exprest Vpon his table: meerly ignorant Whether in shape, this new-created Saint Lookt liker Christ, or either of those twaine Like shamefull death who did with CHRIST sustaine. But (to giue place to trueth) it lookes like neither, But, as the Child resemble doth the father, This new-borne issue of the crafts-man's braine, Got by imagination, hatcht for gaine, Like to the fancie of his fond conceate Who brought it forth, with paine, with labour great, Must only be supposd; An Idol right By Romish definition; (else but slight) The Semblance of a thing but faind to bee, Which no subsistance hath essentially. Put case, a Painter, for a proofe of arte, Three pictures did most exquisite imparte, Of Men, streachd foorth vpon the crosse to death, This Master-peece while he accomplisht hath When the Crafts-Man hath made the portrate of a crucified man, it is at his pleasure to appoint it for a picture of one of the thieues crucified with CHRIST, or of Christ, with the change of some draughts as he thinketh meete. Is't not to his arbitriment left free By Christ to cristen any of the three? Or, at his pleasure, all three theeues to make, Resolving (least they company should lake) Three other Christs to forge? or, to affixe The Superscription of Christ's Crucifixe Aboue the purtrait of a Thiefe of late, (Adjudged so at least in his conceate) It calling Christ? or, if hee rather please The superscription new affixt to raise So make his Christ a Thiefe, for some wrong draught Which nearer observation him hath taught, Can Pope, Priest, Prelate, alter his decree? Which hee thinks fit, that Picture Christ's must be. His Word must for a sentence stable stand, What Hee determins, none can countermand, None can His worke controule. For, if the sight, The Iudge which onely can decerne aright Of Picturs, never hath the Patterne spyed How can in such the grossest faults be tryed? Sense, lacking thus a rule to censure by In vaine, but in the Painter's arte doth pry. Thus foulest Errors in this kind goe free, Thus Painters boldly take them leaue to lie Audaciously, with liberty vnraind, Coosning the world with Crucifixes faind, Them giving foorth CHRIST'S semblances to bee, Which but (at most) His Superfice belie. True Iesus Christ the world's great iudge, while judg'd, Christ Iesus when Hee was crucified was glorious in the meane time to the astonishment of His adversaries: But the Popish Crucifixe faineth a Christ as base as any Malefactor, in nothing glorious. (At shame Heb. 12. 2. nor shrinkt, nor at disgrace who grudgd) An Offring Holy, Heb. 7. 26. Harmelesse, Vndefild, While sacrifiz'd for Man, from grace exild, While, compted with Esay. 53. 12. Transgressors, lift'd on hie, (The 1 Pet. 3. 18. Innocent the Guiltie setting free) Loe! while enduring even the worst of spight, Strength, Glory, Greatnesse, Majestie, and Might. Brake forth so brightlie through contempt's dark clowd, So (cleare) His Godhead did in death, vnshrowd, That, the Centurion, overcome with wonder, (While Heavens their face vaild vp, Earth sobt a-sunder, Math. 27. 46. Ibid. v. 51. These glorious Lanterns, as their lights were spent, To shine forbearing, while their LORD was shent, This, to the God of Strength, while seeming weake, Its strength resigning, whence it strength did take) Forc't was, convinc't in conscience, to confesse That suffer did the Sonne of Righteousnesse. Math. 27. 54. But where's that Splendor darkning Daye's bright beame, These Rayes of Glory, shyning even in shame? What doe their Popish Crucifixes show Of Christ, but shame, death, nakednesse, and woe? What greater Glory set they to our view Then to the basest Malefactor's due, That on a gibbet, e're depriv'd of breath, Endurd like shamefull execrable death? True Christ, to death while yeelding on the crosse, Christ crucified was quickning and converting soules, &amp; conquering principalities and powers. The artificiall crucifixe faines a Christ as dead as the drosse of which it doth subsist. (Life to giue life content ev'n life to losse) Though dead for vs, at all who could no die, Ceast never living Lord of life to bee, Quickning, converting, strengthning Soules, even then When seeming most contemptible to Men, While Bodies long agoe consumd in graue Raisd by His pow'r, of Him twice life receaue. How doe their Crucifixes this expresse Than a Triumphing Christ like nothing lesse? Of their owne Patterns (yet) true shads they are, Viue Idols of a lifelesse Corps, as farre From any force in working, by their view, Or bodyes to raise vp, or soules renew As is the basest Earth, or fondest braine, Which first gave birth to these Inventions vaine. Christ's Bodie (farre above our sin-tost Masse) Christ's bodie was ioined in personall vnion with the God-head. The Popish crucifixe faines a Christ whose body is separate from the Godhead. Not of an onely Man the Body was, But of that peerlesse Lord, true God, true Man, Whose neare conjunction sunder nothing can, Whose humane soule, though from its mansion fore'd, Vpon the crosse by painefull death divorc'd, Yet in the God-head, even o'recome by death The Body Being had, while robt of breath, Which, lying even in graue, His soule possest In highest Heavens, that Paradise of rest, Inviolable yet the Vnion stoode; Nor Heaven, nor Earth (one minute) could seclude The God-head from the Man-hood; life, nor death, Nor hellish horror, nor the sense of wrath Could hinder, still (yet so as none can tell) The Godhead bodily in Christ to dwell: Col. 2. 9. Which caus'd, (though buried hee behov'd to bee) God's Holy-One, corruption not to see, Psal. 16. 8, 9; Acts 2. 27. Preserving thus (while dead, in coffin layde, By putrefaction, as all flesh, to fade) More pow'rfully the Body of our Lord Than all the means the world could els afford. What madnesse then to thinke, (though painter's arte Some shadow of Man's Body can impart, Which from its soule may sev'red bee by death, And turnd in dust, while banished from breath,) That by the pensill, may resembled bee The Sonne of Man, the God of Majestie? Who, having once a mortall shape assum'd, Can, (without danger) never bee presum'd, That from his Manhood (not in any cace) His Godhead to dis-vnion can give place. If this wee hould (of this as who may doubt?) How madde are Men, who fondly goe about Their Crucifixes false, means to appoint, CHRIST'S Body blest, without the Godhead joynt, To represent; and set before the Eye Christ-Man, cut short of divine Majestie; The artificiall Crucifixe teacheth a Christ who is only man, or whose two naturs are not vnite, or who hath two Persons, as the old heritickes did. The Word made flesh denying, or in death Loosing that Vnion, lasting but with breath; Or, faining such a Christ, a Onely Man Even by it selfe subsist whose Body can; Or, of one Nature, or of Persons twaine, A CHRIST Imaginary, therefore vaine; Injuring thus those ever-blessed Three, That Trinall One, which was, is, ay shall bee, Thus venting blasphemies against our Lord, Whose soule abhorreth thus to be ador'd, And whom His Glory and His Praise to give Is. 42. 8.; 48. 11. To grauen Images, doth highly grieue. Christ's Image mockt thus by audacious hands, Christ's Image stands in righteousnesse and holinesse, and can not be seen with bodilie eyes. In Righteousnesse and Holinesse which stands, The object of the soule's spirituall eye By Carnall sight can not discerned bee: And, as no meane presumption 'tis in Man If it be a filthy dishonor to liken the worke of man's hands to God the father, it is no les disgrace to liken the work of man's hands to God the Son. To liken ought his weake invention can Produce, to God, Beginner, Vnbegunne, So to set foorth his ever-procreat Sonne, In nothing to his great Begetter lesse, By ought or toole or pensil can expresse, No lesser madnesse: if wee GOD esteeme, That Holy One who did the world redeeme, Christ's abaising of himselfe giues not libertie to man to abase him more, but obligeth rather to honour Him the more. Who, though for vs, His Glory layde asyde, Did meanly in mortalitie abyde, Should wee, Himselfe cause humbling, more neglect, Or should his Man-hood, breed him lesse respect? Though painter's lines might possiblie present His Counterfite as Hee with shame was shent, Put case it were possible to find out Christ's Lineaments, and to expresse them by art, yet still the glorie of His person discharges to doe Him such disgrace as to liken Him to the worke of man's hands. And of his Servant's-shape some shadow leaue, (Or ayming so, at least the world deceaue) Doth possibilitie a warrant plead, Or to excuse or Iustifie this deed, Since every Sinne hath possibilitie, But none for this as lawfull held may bee? In humane Shape, if GOD the Fathers saw Yet no Resemblance durst presume to draw, Why rather now, since Flesh the Word assumd, May GOD by Man to bee drawne foorth presumd? Sith that the Law, this madnesse to restraine, Midst flames of fire was not given foorth in vaine, Nor now is made lesse valide, than before A Mortall vaile the King of Glory wore. 1 Cor. 2. 8. If not Apostles durst transgresse this law, The Apostles durst not, nor would not draw his purtrait much lese should a profane Craftsman. Nor cause draw foorth or grave the Shape they saw; If none of all Our Lord's obsequious Trayne, His Will durst write, but whom Hee did ordaine; Beyond commission ev'n if none of Those None may preach Christ without a calling from Christ, much lesse make fained pictures of Christ. That wrote, His Shape might to the World expose; If none may, by Himselfe, this honour reach Except by Christ thrust foorth Christ yet to preach, Shall it to painters only bee left free, CHRIST'S shape and Lineaments to falsifie, Even though no warrant doth their worke invite, Nor having seene what to set foorth they sweate. 'Tis like those dreamers, who poore soules deceaue, CHRIST crucifi'd n'ere right considred haue, Whyle once for all, and Once for ay our Lord, Ne're more to bee repeated, did afford Himselfe a living Sacrifice for Sinne, Christ would not bee seene to suffer but once, but will bee heard to have suffred ever. His suffrings He will have set before the eye of the minde by His owne ordinances of Word and Sacrament, but not to the bodilie eye by man's invention. Vpon the Crosse, lost Man from hell to winne, Himselfe Hee did expose to suffer death, Shame, paine, and dolour, ev'n the Father's wrath, No more to bee the object of the Eye, Though by the Eare oft crucified to bee. As death's tormenting throws, as sense of payne, Hee for a season was but to sustaine, So was the Shame which Nakednesse did give, Not all his other suffrings to sur-vive. When therefore having (mortalls to reclame), Sufficientlie now suffred open shame, Even at mid-day Hee drew the vaile of night, About His naked Bodie, so the sight Of gazing eyes (with clowds eclipsd) did stay, Christ darkned the Sunne and made it as Night at Mid-Day while He was suffring, to show that hee would not have men to gaze vpon his naked bodie after hee had suffred sufficient shame. The Popish Crucifixes doe crosse Christ's purpose. Enlightning Some, who midst those mists did stray, Them making see, while weakest made, His Might, Sinne's clowds dispel'd, which did their soules benight. But (loe) their antichristian Crucifixe With vaine Inventions who God's worship mixe, Serves to no other end, but as it may, Christ's Body naked to the eye to lay. And to expose His long-past Shame to sight, Hiding the Glorious vaile of darkned light, By which more honord was that Prince of Peace Than Nakednesse, or Iews did Him disgrace. CHRIST, of the Cover Hee drew on, they striue (Though all in vaine) thus boldly to depriue, Preassing presumptuously, in Christ's despight, To prorogate the shortned shame of Sight. But such their Christ, such Crucifixe they faine, Such Paterne, such the Purtraite: both most vaine. The Painter's fantasie the patterne is: The Purtrait only must resemble this, That lying Spirit; Father of deceate, The Genealogie or Pedegrie of the Popish Crucifixe. That Man true CHRIST should know, who boyles with hate, And studies still to forme in man's fond braine, False Christs; or of the True, conceats prophane, Doth Parent to this purtrat's Patterne proue, Hatcht in the Crafts-man's head as hee doth moue. The Crucifixe, Child of the Paynter's Thought, Oye to this Lying Spirit, thus forth brought By arte, as carefull Midwif's helping hand, Is from the painfull wretch receiued; who fand, And did more labour in this Birth sustaine, As hee opinion did conceiue of gaine. This new-borne Saint thus being brought to light, See how the wretch doth in his Worke delight, Hee gazeth, wondreth, narrowly doth pry, Striues if hee can the least escape espy, Proport'oning by due esteeme its worth, As longsome paines, and labour brought it forth, Which in each feature, finding now compleat, As to adorne some Temple only meet, Hee to the Preist presents't, who streight doth giue It Name; yea, Holinesse, as some beleeue. By Charmes, by Exorcisme of Magick art, The profaine and wicked christning of the artificiall Crucifixe. With Salt, and Water Christned thus a part, With Pardons priuiledg't, with Odors sweet Perfumd, with Altars honord, Head and Feet Anoynted, Torches lighted, Gifts presented, Made fitt for Pilgrimes now to bee frequented, Erected last, in place most eminent, The Never-Erring-Clergie giue consent, That it shall stand to bee admir'd, ador'd, Kiss'd, reverenc'd, crouch'd before, embrac'd, implor'd, The Holy Crucifixe from hence forth cald, Or, On His Crosse the KING OF GLORIE nail'd. The Blinded people's foolishe superstition, The base credulitie of their condition, Approues the Error, ratifies the Deed, With them this Crucifixe doth credit plead, Which in affinity or Shape more neare As they conceiue, the Holier doth appeare. Loe now the Crafts-man, Priest and vulgar Crew, The devilish deifying of the Popish Crucifixe. Ioyntly fall down, and with devotion due, As many Pater-nosters doe repeat By number of their beads, as they finde meet, To this New-Christned-CHRIST; and, as acquent With Tongues their sutes in Latin must bee sent, To This not sparing, with blasphemous breath, The Honour of Latria to bequeath, Preferring it to all the Heauenly Quire, Or Crownde aboue, or Militating heere, Of Angels, Saints; euen to that Mother-Maide, The Queene of Heauen, (of Her if truth be said). But when for foule Idolatrie arraing'd, Some shift in place of Reason must bee fain'd: These subtile Sophists, wittie in invention, Doe pleade by vertue of their good intention, The honour to the Crucifixe ascriv'd, The Purtrate first, by Crafts-man hand contriu'd, Doth hit, but streight sent back, is vpwards driven, And by Reflexe doth sklent hye way to Heauen, The pretense of good intention doth no more excuse the popish Idolaters, than if a woman should abuse her bodie with every one that she thoght like her husband, and then say shee did so of good intention willing to loue all that were like her husband. Possessing such as see with others' eyes, This By-way worship CHRIST no lesse doth please, Than on these Tables earst by God's owne hand Engrav'd, it had beene left th'eleaventh Command. But let those Doctors licence me demand, Who in Intention make Devotion stand, If simple Women in their Husbands' places, May warrantably yeeld to strange embraces, And if it passe may for a just excuse, That their Intention Them did not abuse, Supposing, they did by obedience due Themselues subject, vnto their Husbands true, And, if those Husbands, wrong'd in such a sort, Thus to bee mockt and cousind, ought comport, And over-looke this as a light offence, Which Ignorance doth challenge in defence? This, without shame, these Clerks can not approue, Except some Intrest having in this Loue. How easily it selfe doth Error roote, In such as on God's Light their eyes doe shoote, That on all hazard will goe on Their way, With them or walke, or stumble, stand, or stray? NOW, this great Idole, set to publick view, The profane of-spring and broodie generation of little Crucifixes. Yet can not serve; all of this numbrous Crew, For private vse One must peculiar haue, To beare about Him, even vnto His graue. Enricht with gold and Iewels, These are borne The breasts of Dames of Honor to adorne, Which not beseeming Vulgars (as too deare), The Poorer sort doe Poorer Christlings weare Of polisht Ivorie, of gilded Glasse, Of glistring Horne, of Copper, Tinne, or Brasse, Which by the Priest if hallow'd, so much more Held worthie are of Worship, than before. If any living Saint, heere sucking breath, A Holy man is more like Christ than all the artificiall pictures in the earth, &amp; more worthie of honour for His cause; yet if any man for holinesse were so worshiped as the popish crucifixe, a honest hearted papist would sco?der at that Idolatrie, and why not now, but because he beliveth the Romish Church cannot erre. Who with our Lord more neare resemblance hath, To Him more deare, and held of greater worth, Than all the Images art can bring foorth, In whom this Spirit, Life, and Grace doth shine, Whom a most neere conjunction doth combine, And whom CHRIST (one day) though despised now, Shall not think shame His Heb. 2. 11. Brother to avow, Yet if this Saint of God, adored were, Cald on, as senselesse Crucifixes are, The World anone the sacriledge should see, Cry out against this vile Idolatrie, Abhorre, to any Mortall vnder Heaven Worship, or divine Honour should bee given, But now when greater measure they bequeath, To Stockes, to Stones, to Idoles voyde of breath, They neither can, nor will their Error spy, So darkned hath the devill their Reason's eye, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. Or, to damnation poasting on amaine, Dare in vnrighteousnesse the truth detaine. Rom. 1. 18. Since then those Wares so slender are in worth, To mocked sight lyes only setting foorth, Bookes which pervsd, leaue Ignorants more rude, Gulling the World but with imagind goode, To CHRIST disgracefull, breeding in man's braine Conceats of Him but carnall, and prophaine, What Hee left buryed preassing to proclame, His Glory darkning with disgrace and shame, Loosing these bands insep'rably vnite, By which both Natures in one Person meete, Men's Faith diverting from that solide stay The only Rocke, the Life, the Truth, the Way, John 14. 6. Vpon a Shadow fondly to rely Which CHRIST shall (one day) to bee His deny, As being only the Resemblance vaine All the worship and respect that is given to the artificiall crucifixe is given to a filthie Idole. And Birth fantastick of the Painter's braine, Who, though hee boldly playde the cunning Ape, Did never see, nor could set foorth His shape, The Honour then to This bequeathd, must even Neids-force, bee to a filthie Idole given. Bvt leaving more to stirre this noysome Sinke, The way to get a right sight of Christ shining in the mirror of the scripture, and to be changt in the likenesse of Christ seene there. Poysning pure Soules with a pestifrous stinke, To bee abhor'd, and held in just neglect, Of all, true CHRIST who truly doe affect, And on that Purtrate long to fixe their eye, Drawne by his Spirit, which the soule must see, In Holie Write, that Mirror most divine, In which His Image Gloriously doth shine, By preaching of His Word which set to view By Faith is seene, and doth by Sight renew, So working on the Soule which doth behold, That thus it lookes as from another mold, Both to the selfe and Others seeming strange, Turnd in its liknesse by a gracious change; 1 Cor. 15. 49. So by the Spirit quickned is this Meane, That heere if CHRIST thy Faith hath truly seene, Thou shalt His Shape take on, bee like Him made, Adornd with Glorie which shall never fade, In Thee this Image, whence all Grace doth flow, From Glorie shall to further Glorie grow, Each faithfull Looke on This, of force shall bee Some gracious effect to worke in Thee. Come then, draw neere, Thou who to see aspires Sweete IESVS CHRIST, the Crowne of thy desires; Come, Thou who loues on Him to looke aright (Abhorring Counterfits which mock the sight) Whose face alone doth true content afford, Come, heere behold thy Loue, thy Life, thy LORD. Bvt if thou Him wouldst to Salvation see, A man must see his owne vglines in the glasse of the law before hee can see Christ's beautie in the Gospell. Thy Soule must glas'd in this same Mirror bee, Thy breast's most inward Cabins must bee sought, Thy selfe made Center of thy Circling thought: Thou must not skarre vpon thy Soares to looke, Ezek. 16. 3, 4, 5.

What Hee as Prophet hath expond, by Word In holy Write, as Prophet doth afford Perspicuous, by his Spirit made most plaine, That Gratious Doctor, Teacher of His Trayne. What Hee as King hath gifted and applyed, (And what in Him can bee by God denyed?) Hee doth as King gainst all thy foes maintaine To settle thee, in peace with Him to raigne. Now, if to Him His weaklings bee so deare, Courage dejected soule; thou needst not feare; Ryse, follow on, Thou in this Glasse shalt see CHRIST'S GLORY shining more and more to thee. If Thou from feare bee in some measure fred, How Christ may bee looked vpon for strengthning of thy fayth. If hope of mercie thee to feele hath led Some spunk of life, some woontlesse warmnesse glow Within thy bosome, making tears to flow Of godly sorrow, mixd of Griefe and love, Thy frozen heart begunne to melt and moue; Behold how hee hath breath, as thou dost Mourne To make thy Math. 12. 10; Esa. 42. 3. faintly-smoaking flaxe to burne, And tenderly, till greater strength it breed, Of thy weake Fayth doth touch the bruised reed. Behold how Mat. 9. 2; Mark 2. 3. Luke 5. 18. One, brought in his bed, by force, Layd at his feete, his pittie doth enforce, Departs, of sickenesse and of Sinne made cleane, Rejected not, because despisd and meane; How much more thee shall Hee receaue in grace Who running comst, layst out to Him thy cace, With bleeding heart dost His compassion plead, Seeking to thy diseased Soule remeed? Thy LORD thou mayst, with thee a part who beares, Behold His bottle filling with thy teares, With that Sweete Saint, for sinne, in sense Luke 7. 38. of wrath With luke-warme floods when thou thy cheeks dost bath, With Her sitts mourning, powring from thine eyes In heartie love, thy greeved Lord to please, Streames to be-dew and washe His sacred Feete, That Hee may cleanse, and for Himselfe make meete Thy spotted Soule, who nought esteemest too rare Too pretious, on Himselfe, or cause to ware. Though men doe mock, and with contempt doe prise Thy mourning, thy devotion doe despise, Thy LORD, who (one day) shall thy Mat. 5. 4. paynes compense, Thou speaking mayst perceave in thy defence: Loe Hee, a Banner Cant. 2. 4. of His love doth spread, And to his owne Wine-sellers thee doth leade, That by his Cant. 2. 5. flagons comfort thou mayst fynd, Hartning thy sorrow with his Ih. 16. 20. 22. favours kynd, The earnst thee giving of that gratious day When from thine eyes, teares Apoc. 7. 17; Ibid 21. 4. Hee shall wipe away. Hee shall his Seale vpon thy Ez. 9. 4. 5. 6; Apoc. 7. 3. forehead set That the Destroyer thus may warning get, The wicked World while floods of vengance bath, Thee to discerne, from mongst the Sonnes of wrath. Hold to thy shoulder, sturre not to take on How hee who beleiueth must looke to Christ presenting his burthen and his yoke. His lightsome Mat. 11. 30. burthen; which repenteth none That ever it did beare: which all makes glad On whomsoever Hee the same hath layd. Behold Hee stretcheth foorth His hand, to lay His Law vpon thy back, thy sinnes to slay, So to presse foorth thy old impostumd soares, But not to harme thee, who his Peace implores. Thy flesh and vitious Nature, must bee slayne: Thou must not shrinke at sense of outward Payne. Behold, His Mat. 11. 29. Yoke Hee brings! How loath to part? Stretch forth thy necke, thy hands, thy feete, thy heart, That Hee may bind it on: that, (hence) for ay None, saue thy Lord, thy service challenge may. Loe! that thy yoke may light and easie bee Hee goes before Himselfe and drawes with thee, Yea both thy yoke and thee Hee drawes; and beares Thee, wrestling with thy burthen who appeares. Goe on: O never, never leave thy LORD Where ere Hee leads thee; Hee will strength afford. Hee no where els Thee shall invite to goe But where before, the way Himselfe did show. BVT NOW doth Sathan rage with greater spight How a man under tentation may looke vpon Christ in the mirror of His word. Then when secure thou layst in sinne's dark night, Redoubling his assaults, Thee vexing more, Presenting bayts more frequent then before? Behold thy LORD, whom HEAVEN, whom Earth obeys, In Mat. 4; Mark 1. 12. Luke 4. 1. Wildernesse, alone, twice twentie dayes With apparitions visible frequented, Not from that Ill-One's firie darts exempted. If Christ hee durst attempt to make his Thrall, Whom gainst his dints Hee knew a brazen wall, What wonder thee a weakling hee entyse, To his persute whose soule oft guardlesse lyes? But seest thou Christ prevaile? His powre confine? Him streight dis-arme? The Victorie is thine. O stand! O heere behold Ex. 14. 13. the LORD'S Salvation! This Combate to thy safety hath relation, Heere Sathan also made before thee flee, Thy selfe in CHRIST victorious thou mayst see. But holie water in the Ayre to tosse, Sathan is not affrayd though sometimes hee faine feare, for holy water or crossing. And with the finger heere and there to crosse, Scorne thou, as fruitlesse freets, least Sathan slight And scorne such weapons should resist his might. Doth now the World a mocking-stock thee make? How a man vnder c?tempt of the world, or despised of his friends may looke on Christ. Thy Psal. 38. 11. friends (before) thy fellowship forsake? Now art thou hated, since by gratious Iohn 15. 19. change Thy former life become to thee is strange? Now pointed at? because to sin thou shunnes And no more to thy wonted 1 Pet. 4. 4. ryot runnes? Now doe the wicked louse their tongues to lyes, Traducing thy profession as they please, Not sparing even thy person, cens'ring thee Or madde, or foolish, or precise to bee? Behold thy LORD, exposd to like despight, Vexd, mockt, persued, with malice greatest might, Despysd, opprest, the marke of envy made, A common foe for all men to invade. See Iohn 1. 11. how Hee comes vnto His Owne by Blood, By bonds of nature, even by them withstood, Rejected, not receiv'd, but mett in place Of kindlie acceptation, with disgrace. A Man, beside Himselfe, in their esteeme Behold the Saviour of the world doth seeme: Him they mistake, and seeke to apprehend As if His countrie's Luke 23. 2. foe, not Cæsar's friend, Even one whose course, (which they not rightly saw) Their Iohn 11. 45. State might touch, themselues in danger draw. Each day that did His life's short terme compleet Heere, with a severall affront did meet. But while His course Hee closd, O griefe! O teares! See how Is. 33. 3; Mat. 27. 41. &amp;??. unmov'd, what bitter taunts Hee beares. With what vnvtterable anguish torne, While suffring midst His Paines, the Hight of Scorne, Which more than all the Stripes, His Soule did racke, Which scourging Burrio's layd vpon His backe. Behold, they nod Ibid. 27. 29. 30. the head, they bow the knee; Who Wisdome was, to them a foole must bee. The Honorable Sonne of God they floute, And put a Purpure Math. 27. 28. garment Him about, A Crowne of Thornes, vpon His holy head, And in His harmelesse hand a brittle Reede Worthy no other Scepter, in their thought: With shame, with scorne to death He thus was brought. “LORD Thou, that I should liue, who daind to die, “Thy servant and disciple make of mee, “Though I with Thee should suffer, even while heere, “Scorne, spight, contempt, wrong most unjustlie beare, “Which, to my sight, thou standst, by my procuring, “Before the eyes of liuelie faith enduring.” If Povertie thee pinch, if want thee vexe How a man vnder povertie may looke vpon Christ in the mirror of the Word. Looke on thy Lord, whom care did ne'er perplexe Of wordly Wealth; who heere did liue content To serue Himself with what His servants lent; Those holy Luke 8. 3. Matrons who did Him attend Vnto His death, who did permit to spend Their proper goods, forth for His vse to lay, The charges of His Iourney to defray. Who being tax'd did Mat. 17. 27. Tribute-money lake: Whom Mat. 8. 20. house, nor hold did ever owner make: In poore estate most meanely who was Luke 2. 7. borne; Whose offring, which the Ibid. 24. Altar did adorne In His behalfe, instead of fatned Levit. 12. 8. droaves, The poore-man's Pigeons was, the Turtle doves; In Ioseph's house his life not Rich could bee: A poorer spoyle the Sunne did never see Than at His death His foes did part by lote, His greatest wealth a Iohn 19. 23. sober seamelesse coate. If this communion with his povertie Griefe of all straits can not asswage to thee, Looke on the riches of spirituall grace Which hee on all bestowes, His steps who trace. Loe, heyre Hee is of Heb. 1. 2. Heaven and Earth: of all, And with Himselfe Rom. 8. 17. Co-Heyre annexe thee shall, Yea will not (heere) with thee so sharply deale But (as best sutes His Glorie, and thy well) Both will, and can provide, that thou nor lacke Foode for thy bellie, cloathing for thy back. And, though thou seest not how, yet take not care, His providence to Luke 12. 6. Sparrowes in the ayre, To Lillyes of the field, to every thing Which His eternall Word to life did bring Extended is, and (as to him seemes best) Thy Portion furnish shall amongst the rest. By speciall care, thy Lord can make thee feele, Enlarg't, the lytle measure of thy 1 King 17. 14-16. Meale, Thy Cruise of Oyle sufficient, thee to feede 2 King 4. Till more Hee send, to last as thou hast need, Can in thy greatest troubles thee vphold, Deut. 8. 4. Cause that thy Garments, nor thy shoes waxe old, Dan. 1. And if Hee but a dish of Pulse propine Aboue thy fellows can thy face make shine; Hee multiply thy lytle, even thy least, Can, though a daye's provision thou but hast, As easily it makes to hundreths streach As for fiue Mat. 14. 19; Iohn 6. 11. Thousand Soules hee earst made reach (With plentie fed,) those Loaues and fishes few, For Fyue alone which els were but enew. If thou for Him doe thirst, by manner strange He, for thy vse, in wine can Iohn 2. 8. Water change: Yea living Iohn 4. 14. streams can give thee, if he list, Which tasted once, thou never more shall thrist. A Fish, with money in its mouth, be driven Mat. 17. 27. Shalt on thy Hooke, 1 King 17. 6. Ravens feede thee Noone and Even, Heaven's Ex. 16. 14; Psal. 78. 27. Manna rayne, the flintie Exod. 17. 6; Numb. 20. 9. Psal. 78. 15. Rocke shall serue Thy thirst to quench, ere thou for want doe starue. “O that I may (Lord) for thy Kingdome care, “Thee aboue all things serue; so shall I feare “Adversitie nor want: thus what may ayde “My vext estate, shall to my hand be layde. If Rich thou bee, take heede vncertaine Tim. 16. 17. wealth Steale not thy heart, thy soule deprive of health: How a man in wealth &amp; prosperitie may behold Christ with profite. Trust not therein; be not puft vp with pride Of things, on Prover. 23. 5. Eagles' wings which swiftly slyde, Fixe thou on Him alone thine heart, thine Eye, To make Thee Rich, who poore did chuse to bee. 2 Cor. 8. 9. O! let thy humble Cariage, modest mynde, Thy thoughts with moderation confind, Beare witnesse, that thou pure in Spirit art, That thou dost thirst and hunger in thy heart To bee inriched with that Righteousnesse Which CHRIST still gifts, yet never is made lesse. Bee greedie of His golde; O begge to weare His Garments, that thou glorious mayst appeare, That truly rich, thou mayst thy selfe present To God; Phil. 4. 11. in wealth, in want alike content. These earthly things, but solide as a dreame, More worthy than they are, doe not esteeme, But for thy Lord's vse, seeke to vse them, so That on their Owner thou mayst them bestow: Whom if thou see, or in his Churches neede Or Any of his Saints, thy pittie pleade, O then thy superfluitie to spare To help the cause belonging to His care, His poore distressed Brethren to relieue In whom His grace and Image shineth viue, A horrible Ingratitude must bee, Yea even a damnable Impietie. If sense of payne, if soares of any sort How a man in sicknesse may get a helpfull sight of Christ. Thee so assaile, as hard is to comport, Looke on thy LORD, how torturd for thy sake, Scourg'd backe and sides, God's wrath, thy paynes to slake, See how his pretious bloode for thee is shed, To Calvary with shame, along while led, With which the senselesse streets all red, seem'd blushing, While bath'd with Rivers from his woundes foorth gushing. Behold the Nailes, driven both through foote and hand, Not in a masse of mettell which doth stand Him suffring to set foorth: a living Man Thy object is; what spight, what malice can Enduring on the Crosse; a publicke wonder, Whose Legs and Armes streatchd foorth, neere rackt asunder, Not suffered were to stand, as to His griefe The least-least meanes afford might of reliefe, But as most obvious to the Souldiers' minde They might bee found, His Bones to breake combinde. Behold, by burthen of His Body blest, His flesh doth yeeld (while being down-ward prest). Gaping and growing Wounds, still made more large, As more His Weight His tender Hands doth charge. Harke, how He cryes I Iohn 19. 28. Thirst, complaines of drouth, For other Paines who opned not His mouth, Though passing great, most sensibly though felt, With this of all most vehemently delt. O see, how He His weary Iohn 17. 29. Neck extends And languishing, with ready mouth attends To drink the offred Vinegar and Gall, His burning Thirst to quench, to Finish All, Of which the bitter Math. 27. 34. sowrenesse proving, straight A very Tast to Him becomes a draught. This Ruefull sight presented to thine eyes, Inward or outward Paynes may serue to ease, Grieues all allay, giue Patience to comport, Till God thy Dolours slaken, in some sort. How a man in health may looke vpon Christ. If healthy, sound, and strong, from trouble free, Looke on the Price that purchast All to thee, His 1 Pet. 2. 24. Stripes did make thee whole: thy Esa. 53. 4. LORD did beare Thy Maladyes, that thou mightst sound appeare. Hee thy Infirmities on Him did take, Thy Health to thee a Blessing thus to make, And that thy sicklie Soule might whole bee found, Whose stat's oft worst, thy Body while most sound. “O that I may Lord whollie heere imploy “My selfe, while health, while strength I doe enjoy, “In serving Thee; and, to my dayes as length “Thou addst, I loue Thee may with greater strength, “That so, while health and strength, as shads shall flee, “Both sound and strong I may bee found in Thee.” Doth long discent, vn-discontinued race How a Noble or base borne person, may behold Christ for their instruction. Of hon'rable Ancestors, make thee place, Worldly Preheminence to thee beget Aboue the Simpler Sort, below thee set? Art thou a Noble, or some speciall Peere So Great as thy Inferiors thee admire? Or, (tho Enobled not by Place) doth blood From the Ignoble Vulgar thee seclude? In this forbeare to glorie; but behold Thy Lord of Royall Linage, Race most Old, A BRAUNCH whose blood deriv'd from David's stemme Did make Him right to weare a Diademe, A King, respecting even His Manhoode, borne; Yet, all proud thoughts of Pedegries to scorne, Himselfe abasd, in Grace to make vs Great, And (though a Personage of High estate) Became most low, vs Hon'rable to make Even our Dishonour on Himselfe did take. “O seeke Nobilitie, which ne'er shall fade, “Honour from which thee no man can degrade, “By seeking right in Him, a Child to bee Of GOD; true Honour's most supreme degree. Art thou by birth Ignoble, Base, Obscure? Behold thy Glorious King in state as poore, As meane as thou, descended, thee to raise, Even with Himselfe thee to possesse and sease, Not in a State but lasting for a day, But of a Kingdome made secure for ay, Vpon a Throne thee freely to set downe To swey a Scepter, and to weare a crowne. If Base thou bee, yet still to climbe assayes The bruckle braunches of vaineglorious wayes, If Noble, yet to swell with Pride doth chuse, And seekst ambitiouslie all meanes to vse To proppe thy worldlie Credite, with profane And worthlesse wretches, who no Course disdaine May further their base Ends, affecting Praise Of Men, their Names upon Fame's wings to raise, Blind to behold that Glorie, to bee found With GOD, which seene, all such Desires doth bound; O study then more steadfastly to stare, And on thy Lord to looke with greater Care; Yea, neede thou hast to Touch, from Him that so Vertue to heale this Luke 8. 46. Vanitie may flow. Behold, he sits as Doctor, teaching thee How a man may learne humilitie looking on Christ in the Scripture. (Himselfe thy Patterne) true Humilitie; Inviting thee who to His Schoole dost seeke To learne of Math. 11. 29. Him, who lowly is and meeke. See, how to purge thy Soule of stinking Pride, The God of Glorie, Glorie layes aside, A Philip. 2. 7. Servant's shape assumes, a Man most meane Becomes; mongst Publicanes and Sinners seene, Math. 9. 10. To winne them home: Himselfe associating Even to the Basest, Good to them to bring, Accesse and speech to None, when askd, denying, Most homelie with His friends, on Him relying. Behold, (not pampred with delicious fare,) With these Hee sits whose Table turnes their snare, His traine attending, till He baselie haue By surfetting become his bellyes slave; But Math. 21. 18. hungring oft, and thirsting for thy sake, His sober Trayne doth His Companions make, Serv'd at one Table, feeding even as Hee; Whose Iohn 13. 5. feete from filth that He might wash, O see How with a Towell girt about Hee stands, And stowping downe, with Basen twixt His hands, With humble Heart performs that service meane, And wipes them with the Linnen, thus made cleane, The Greatest teaching who His Schollers are, For Him their Pride to mortifie so far That to His Least-ones, though despisd they lye, The meanest charge in loue they not deny. If He, thy Lord and King, became so low, Wilt thou, to be His Servant who makes show, Lodge in a haughtie heart soule-poysning Pride, Who glory canst, as thine, of nought beside Sinne, Miserie and Shame? Thy Pride disclame, Or in thy Lord no part thou needst to clame. Humble Lord Iesus mongst His lowlie traine Doth no ambitious servants intertaine. Both Paradice and Heaven spewd out once haue The Proud, and such can never back receaue. If Honour's smoakie vapour blind thee so, How the Ambitious may behold Christ &amp; bee humbled. Thy GOD, thy selfe nor suffring Thee to know; Thee, if High place so please, that nought beside Can serue to feed the fire-brand of thy Pride, Why thus O Foole! art thy affection fird With what thou canst nor haue, nor keepe, acquird? Why doth their worldly Greatnesse thee intyse, Who nothing lesse than Vertue's worth can prise? Why pin'st thou for Preferment? Casts thy care On things which may thy inward Peace impare? Is earthlie Dignitie to Thee so deare, In it thy Happinesse esteeming heere, That, (with all danger) thou darst it imbrace, By this prejudg't though of a better Place? Vaine Glorie-hunter change in time thy course, Leaue taynted Streams, seeke Honour in the Source. If meanes thou vse, with Christ thou mayst obtaine In Glory which shall never end to raigne. His Crosse to Climbe, by suffring bee content, The Seale by which the Saints to Heauen are sent; There shall thy Honour, (never to take flight,) By GOD bee given, in Men and Angels' sight, Where Time discourt, nor Envie thee can harme, Nor flattring Straines of Sycophants can charme Thy Prince's eare, from Honour to degrade Thee, Great but for thy greater ruine made, Nor Life bee short, toile-conq'red Sutes to brooke Some anxious Dayes, but lasting as a Looke. If Loue of Money, whence all 1 Tim. 6. 10. Evill springs, Thee, (prickt with thornie cares), in bondage brings, How the avaritious man may be healed by looking on CHRIST. Moue thee to scrape, to scart, to pinch, to spare, To rake, to runne, to kill thyselfe with care, Things most secure to doubt, to waite, to watch, Of Penny, or of Penny-worth to catch Some Gnat, by chance, in Spider-web arriv'd, Of Bowel-wasting-wretched wayes contrivd, Draw neere, heere learne but for the Math. 6. 34. Day to care, Vncertaine to suck vp To-morrow's Ayre: Come see thy Lord and His poore Traine preparing Things for another life; no travell sparing About this Task: for worldly goods content With what by God to serue the Time was sent, Like Pilgrims, passing to their blest aboade, Not over-charged with superfluous loade. Alace! what meanst thou, (while in soule most pore,) Thy selfe to toile, to conquesse cankring Ore? Heaps to hoarde vp of Pelfe, whose Rust at last Shall Witnesse bee, that Iam. 1. 2. 3. Sentence just is past Of thy damnation? O! in time forbeare On drosse, on dunge, still to bee doating heere; Care for these Treasures, which in Christ are found, In which all grace, all wisdome doth abound: That Pearle, Himselfe, aboue all price who is, Than all the world beside, more deare to His; If thou enrichd wouldst by some Good-thing bee, Sell all thou hast; and with affection free Prefer to part, with all things earthly twinne, Losse even thy lyfe, this peereles Mat. 13. 45. 46. Pearle to winne: And though no Coine thou dost command, nor ware With this Equivalent thou canst compare, Hee without Isa. 55. 1; Apoc. 3. 18. price, or money will bestow, (As thou thy wants and Indigence doth show,) Both gold and garments, Ih. 6. 33, 35. livelie foode and all What wish thou canst, yea even Himselfe withall. Mongst those diseases, to thy soule which sticke, How the Licentious may learn Temperance by looking on Christ. If of the fever of Intemp'rance sicke, Selfe-rotting fleshlie pleasure it affect, Thee carying headlongs to eternall wreake, If with this beastlie Sensualitie, This soule-besotting sinne, thou grieved bee, That poyson casting vp, which (late) seemd sweete, And with delight thy senses did invite Even to a surfet, Longing for remeed, Looke on thy Lord, who all His dayes was dead To Earthlie pleasures: who, with grieues acquented, Isa. 33. 3; ibid. A man of sorrowes liu'd, heere vnlamented, Whose breast did beare, brash't with displeasure's dart, A bruised Mark 8. 12. Spirit, and a Psal. 69. 20. broken heart, On whose sad Mat. 26. 38; Mark 14. 33 and 34. soule did heavie sorrowes light, When wrath sustaining, (due to vs by right,) In Him our sinfull pleasures were persued, Eternallie which wee had not eschued If God and vs Hee had not stept betweene, Even with his owne Heart-blood to make vs cleane. Hast, sensuall slaue, thy filthie soule to hyde Vnder his shadow, least thy daring pride With wrath bee punisht: who forbidden Tree Of false delights durst taste, defended thee. Behold Heb. 5. 7. Hee mourns, for what thou madst thy sport, While check't in Conscience; O! with tears resort To Him in private, lest for lightlie prising His Tears, for want of tears in thee arising, Anguish and sorrow, which shall never slake, Teares never finding truce, thee overtake. Behold, how Horror on his soule doth sease, Forth-wringing sighs and sobs, for thy disease, With wrath brunt vp for sinne, in which of late Thy foolish soule did false content conceate. “O change thy mind: Thoughts sometime seeming sweete “Iudge causes now for which thy cheeks to weete. See, how all baithd in His owne blood Hee lyes, Thy lewd delights how He most dearely buyes, Torne, beaten, stabt, with thorns, nailes, cruell speare; Stript naked, Sham'd and slayne; yea more, doth beare, Persuing wrath, to expiate thy Crime, Thy beastly swine-like bathing, all thy time, In brutish lusts, still wallowing in the myre Of fylth, no limits set to thy desire. O! See his veynes their pretious Treasures spending, His heart yet hot, a double streame foorth sending Of blood and water. Quicklie, quicklie haste With mournefull soule, which truely doth detaste Thy vile licentious life: most humbly craue Those guiltlesse streames in thee no guilt may leaue, That (hence) by vertue of this Ransome fred, Tears thou to Him, who bloode for thee, mayst shed. Soft ease exile, till, by vnfaind confession, Thy pittying LORD for thee make Intercession. Those pois'nable delights, disgorg'd now having, Once greedilie drunke in, thy soule deceaving; Resolving (hence) by action, nor consent More to licke vp thy sins' loathd excrement, To sense though seeming sweete, which now turnd sowre, A flood of bitternesse on thee doth powre, Thee, stinging with soule-wringing sad remorse, The more represt repining with more force. But, gainst this Tyrant having now prevaild, By time, this hundreth-headed Monster quaild, Beware, once foyld, thou never set it free, Once damn'd, ne're after it absolved bee, Least by that Righteous Iudge, whose sentence stands, Thou bee adjudged to eternall bands, Whose trampled Heb. 10. 19. blood Hee shall at thee require, A Sow turnd backe to wallow in the 2 Pet. 2. 22. myre. If with thyselfe, for Sinne, to live at strife In detestation of thy vitious life Thou truly dost desire, to find true peace, Looke, looke upon thy LORD'S most lovelie face, Perpending, pond'ring, laying deepe to heart, No midst there is, but thou with Him must part, For ever sev'red from His Holinesse, To pyne in Torments which no time makes lesse, Thy Back, in time, or turning, with thy Sinne, (As thy Mat. 5. 29. 30. right hand or eye though deare,) to twinne. 'Tis base to thinke (if soules not to betray) That Christ and Cor. 14. 15. Belial can together stay, Thy Lord's chast loue, and thy licentious lusts A man must either renunce his sinfull lusts or Christ. Hee can not haue both. From thy divided soule one other thrusts. Pleasure in Him and fleshlie pleasure fall So foull at strife, they can, nor mixe, nor wall. To bee conform'd to Him take pleasure; so As thou makst progresse shall thy pleasure grow, Pleasure without compare, which thee shall make Sinne's deare bought seeming pleasures soone forsake. No Concupiscence e're defild his minde, Nor sinfull Motions least-least place did find In His affections, Him to lead astray, Darkning in Him the weakest shining Ray Of perfite holinesse, mou'd but draw neare That beastly Idole, as thy life held deare, The which to serue thou all thy dayes hast doted, To sinfull, sensuall delights, devoted. O runne to Him for grace; Mat. 7. 7. 8; Mark 11. 24. Luke 11. 6; Iohn 16. 24. Iames 1. 6. Hee can deny None, who in patient hope, knock, seeke, or cry. If thou but mourne to Him with sorow true Of lusts vncleane, thy Devill hee will subdue. His Father's service, Him in such a fashion Did ravish with continuall meditation, Wholly with This tane vp, that in his minde No idle Rav'ryes place besids could finde, Such as thy time doe waste, doores open make To Sathan and his Trayne; who course doth take On Wings of vaging thoughts, before to send His Messingers; comes then apace in end Himselfe; These in securitie possest, And having rowme prepaird for him to rest. His Calling painefully hee did persue At all occasions: teaching thee thy due, To watch, to fast, to pray, Hee giues the ground, Least thou by Sathan shouldst bee Idle found. Hee vs'd the meanes, of which hee had no neede, But by example that He thee might lead. In solitarie Luke 28. 37; Mat. 14. 23. Mark 6. 46. mountaines, all alone, Hee oft for thee hath mournd, till night was gone, Hath all the day-long in the Iohn 8. 12. Temple stood, Feeding the famisht soule with Heavenly food, Delighted more his Father to obey, His will to doe, to Heaven to teach the way, When Iohn 4. 31. 32. 33. Thirst or hunger vrg'd, then drink or eate, Though length of Time and travell did invite. “Now if a Patterne this to make, thee please, “A Scope to ayme at, standing not for ease, “Bee diligent to follow, spare no paine, “Thus are thy lusts subdu'd, thy sinne is slaine. O giue me LORD, with floods of teares unfaind To bath my bosome, with uncleannesse staind; Looke on a sorrie wight, in mournefull state, A Lazare lying at thy mercie's gate: O passe not by: let mee thy pitty proue, Ezek. 16. 8. Cast over mee the Mantle of thy loue: Though I bee out of measure vile, yet LORD, I cleane shall bee, if thou but speake the word. Thou who hast proudly the oppressor played, A rav'ning vulture on the Pigeon preyd, The faces of the poore hast grunde, laid watch The very morsels from their mouths to snatch, The Tyrannizing extortioner, by turning to Christ procureth pardon. Luke 19. Runne, runne, make hast, thy Saviour comes along, Climbe with Zacheus to eschue the throng Of sinnes, which happily in silence lye, Yet to the Heavens for wrath and vengance cry, And, on thy selfe if lookt thou hast aright, Thou canst no misse a comfortable sight Of Him, the lost who came to seeke and saue, Of whom thou shalt not a repulse receaue. “None ask in fayth and do vnpardond part, “Those suts alone lack successe which lack heart. Behold, no readier thou art course to take Due reparation for thy wrongs to make Than Hee, to bid himselfe thy guest to bee, Salvation offring, even vnaskt of Thee. If Envy, harbord but in worthles breast, How the Envious may be helped by looking on Christ. With plentie pind, disquieted with rest, Evill with good, with soundest health most sicke, With wellfare wretched, doth thy soule afflict, Looke on thy loving Lord, and blush to see Him for his Foes, in loue, content to die, While causlesly, thou dost thy Brother hate, Who harmd thee never, but in thy conceate, Or, as the bleard-man's eye the light offends, Whose hurt upon his owne defect depends. Thou, whose proude heart doth boyle with furye's flame, Impatient passions healed by looking on Christ. Who canst not thy vndaunted Passions tame, O, bee ashamd the Meeknesse to behold Of thy provoked Lord, betrayd and sold, By words, by deeds injurd; in whom did shine Such patience, that even those who did repine To see Him liue he pittyed, yea procurd For them, by whom Hee cruell death endurd. Luke 23. 34; Isa. 53. 12. Learne, as thou lookst, thy beastlie rage to bound, To bridle Furie, least it thee confound, Which as a fire, still readie is to burne, As to revenge, or malice thou dost turne, Yea to devoure, if finding once a vent, Though for the least conceated discontent. Base Feare, who darst not in thy place discharge Feare to doe right, in evrie estate, cured by looking on Christ. Thy duetie, lesning what thou shouldst enlarge, Looke heere, and learne wise Courage, to persue Thy righteous Ends, what's to thy Calling due, For fead nor favour, which thou canst no spare, Thy Lord's Commission if thou not empare. Hath God thee cald his Counsels to disclose, His will to publish? Ezek. 2. 6. standst thou who oppose Thy message? What 1 Sam. 17. Goliah thee assaile? What raging 2 King. 18. 17. Rabsaketh against thee raile? Fearst thou distresse? 1 King 22. 27. what though constraind to feed Thy famisht Bodie with affliction's bread While heere thou breathst, wilt thou to speake forbeare But what may pleasing be to Ibid. Achab's eare. Art thou a 2 Chr. 18; 1 King 13. 1. Man of God, a Prophet true? Ez. 3. 18, &amp; 33. 7. It lyes thee on thy life, what ere ensue, Wrath to denounce gainst a revolting Land: Though 1 King 13. 4. Ieroboam should streatch foorth his hand. Nor death nor danger, thou by sense must scan. Thou must not shrink to say, 2 Sam. 12. 7. Thou art the Man. Him, whom thy hand hath charged, Heb. 4. 12. of his word With the two-edged soule-dividing sword, Thou canst not but to Indignation moue, If Thou a Coward in His cause shouldst proue. To speake doth thy commission warrant beare, And dost thou of the Arme of flesh take feare? Behold, though to the 1 King. 19. 4, 5, 6, 7. desarts forc'd by flight, To shield thy life from tiranizing spight, Thy LORD can send, who best doth know thy neede, An Angell, in thy Famine thee to feede. Can strengthen thee, that Ier. 40. 1. Chaines nor Ibid. 20. 2. Stockes nor Ibid. 32. 3, and 38. 6. Iaile Shall in His Service hence thy Courage quaile; Even for thy cause, can make the Act. 16. Earth to quake, All the foundations of the prison shake, Thy boults of brasse, thy bands to brust asunder, Thy keepers overcome with feare and wonder, To stoupe before thee, and to wash with teares Thy strips, the badges which for Christ thou beares. If GOD bee for thee, panse no who oppose: His 2 King. 19. 18. Hooke can haill the haughtiest by the nose. What ere thou art, beware for Feare, to wrong Thy Liege or Lord, to whom thou dost belong, Least for a Counseller, of faith vnfaind, A Servant, with no imputation staind, Disloyall and Vnfaithfull thou be found; To thy base Ends to lay a sliprie ground While thine owne Ease, (of all true worth denude,) Thou setst before GOD'S glorie and their Good, And, from the Right made slavishlie to swerue, Stoupst downe their Will, though not their Well to serue. Although, (transported with the Times disease,) Thy selfe and Men thou for a space mayst please, Base Temporizer, yet when better Light The Weaknesse of thy wayes shall set in sight, In thine owne Colours then bee seene thou must; For loyall Subject, Servant worthie trust To God, thy Prince and Lord, thou shalt apeare A slavish Drudge alone to servile Feare. Behold, that No man's face should breed affright, Or turne thee but a haire-bredth from thee right, Thy Lord Himselfe doth in the Mirror show As to his faythfull Servants friendlie, so Mat. 10. 32, 33; Mark 8. 38. Most terrible to All, whom Feare doth draw, Of Man than God to stand in greater aw. Thou whose leud tongue and lips to lyes did moue, Looke heere, and learne the Truth to speake, to loue. To looke on Christ for bridling and ruleing of the tongue. No guile was in his mouth. No faire Pretence Of Complementall kindnesse mockt the sense Of Any, His Societie who sought; Isa. 53. 6. His speaches never varyed from his Thought. None Hee did 1 Pet. 2. 22. cousin, none with lyes deceaue, Did flatter none, of none would flattery haue, While foul Mat. 11. 19, and 12. 24. Iohn 8. 48. reproach His Patience did assaile, His peace he keept: 1 Pet. 2. 23. raild on, He did no raile. Hee No-man slandred, but who did offend, In time and place most fit did reprehend, In All rebuking sinne; Hee Cursed none But when of Heaven and Earth as Iudge alone, Gainst Hypocrits, Professors but in show, Hee thundred foorth damnation, wrath and woe. Chast were His speeches, sober were His words, To nought vndecent His discourse debords. No Time Hee did in idle purpose spend But such as did to edifying tend: Hee knew, in things committed to His care, The fittest season both to speake and spare. By hurtfull Silence He did Nought conceale, His Father's Glory, or his People's well That might prejudge; in speache nor word at all Vntimely vttred from his lips did fall. “Thus to thy Good, as Hee did frame His speach, “Him make thy patterne; speak as He doth teach. “What by exemple hee doth set thee to, “According to thy measure, ayme to doe. IN SHORT, cause All heere can not reckned be, Everie maladie of soule may be helped by looking by faith on Christ in the Scriptur and everie vertue may be gotten this way. To reade thy life's past legend leaving Thee, So, in the Mirror, for thy help to looke, To turne the volumnes of that sacred Booke Where Christ is seene aliue, dead, rais'd againe To life, for sinne ne're after to bee slaine, That looking heere, faults of what ever kinde By light of Scripture in thy selfe thou find, Christ thy Consulter thou alone mayst make, What course most meet for thy remeed to take. What ever Sinnes thy Conscience on thee draw, By looking in the Mirror of the Law Christ make thy glasse, (tho with thy faults offended,) To show thee how thy misses may bee mended. What ere deforme doth in thy soule abide, In Him looke something that defect to hide, No leprous spot vnpurgt in thee is seene, The which in Him thou mayst not haue made cleane, How ere in thee Sinne's Plague its poison spread, Seeke out, in Him, and thou shalt find remead. To God, to Man, by whatsoever bands What thou to doe, or suffer oblisht stands, How e're extended bee thy dutye's lines Looke still on Christ, as in His Word He shines, By light of which thy minde lift vp to see Him in the Heavens, dispensing vnto thee These vertues which hee craues; and what hee showes By Life's rare Patterne, working even in those In whome His loue a true desire doth bread To bee conforme, made like Himselfe their Head. True faith, not firme but for a day or houre, Truth of religion may bee learned of Christ seene in the Scriptur. But such as stedfast stands, in ev'ry stoure, True Loue, possessing all the soule and senses, True powrs all drawing, (free of faind pretences,) To God, in full obedience to His will, In absolute submission, suffring still With patient heart as pleaseth Him to deale, Who best doth know what best is for thy well; Pure worshipping of God, in maner chast, For warrant as His ordinance thou hast, Without all mixture of Inventions vaine, The bastard broode of man's presumptuous braine, Him teaching thou shalt heare, Him showing see; Himselfe in Person even preceeding thee, A blest exemplar, a most gracious guyde, And if thou loue, (sinne's luggage layde aside,) To follow on, to thy eternall well In thee the like Him working thou shalt feele. Whatever bonds of neighbourhood doe clame Thy Lord will fitt, and by degrees thee frame Dutie to parents and friends how to be learned at Christ. Thy Duty to discharge, to Great, to Small As equity requires to doe to All; Mercie to show vnto the miserable As neede in them exacts, as thou art able: As Lazarus, as His Disciples deare Hee did esteeme, loue to thy friends to beare, Kindred and bloode with due respect to prise, But those whom Nature thee more nearlie tyes Most to regard, thy Parents, who did spare No paynes for thee, while for thy selfe to care Thou couldst not, in more speciall degree, In greater measure, loe Hee teacheth thee While from the Crosse, to Iohne, his loving friend, Io. 19. 26, 27. Now in His place, HER hee doth recommend Who gaue Him birth, His Virgine-Mother blest, By speciall care Her singling from the rest. Servants may looke, in servant's shape, how Hee Servants may learne their dutie by looking on Christ. Good proofe did give of his fidelitie And diligence to Him did Him employ, So, follow on with cheerefullnesse and Ioy, That to what ever Charge their Place them call, As done to CHRIST their service may bee all. Eph. 6. 5, 6. Maisters, remarking how their LORD did lead And masters their dutie. These twelue, who speciall priviledge did plead To serve Him as Disciples: how most kind, Most affable Him all of them did find, Their faults so wisely checking that no eye Did no their well sought in His service see, May learne in meeknesse, lenitie and loue Eph. 9. 6. To rule aright, not Tyrannizers proue, Their servants in obedience due to draw, By wisdome more than force, loue more than awe. The Maryed may that strait conjunction see, And the maried their dutie. Of matchlesse loue, that sacred mysterie, Christ and His Church combining, thence to loue May learne, as wedded to a LORD aboue Who lov'd them first, so from this patterne draw In earthly wedlock a religious law, Of holy loue a lesson, how to frame These dutyes chast which mariage bands do clame. The fitted Soule, which hath its lusts subdued, Singly to liue with strength of grace endued, A Nazarite to God to which is given Mat. 19. 11, 12. To liue, an Eunuch consecrate for Heaven, Hath for a Guyde, to follow who invits, Iesus of Naz'reth, prince of Nazarites. Iohn 1. 45. Heere carefull Parents how to trayne may see And parents their dutie. Their Children, Them how nurse in pietie, How in their hearts to sow the seeds of grace, How vice and inborne Error to displace, Hereditarie Evils, faults foreseene, Sinnes ready to break foorth how to preveene, Mat. 16. 6-12. How keepe from leavenning with doctrins vaine, From course of life corrupt how to restrayne. Heere Subjects study may subjection true, By looking on Christ as Hee shines in the Mirror of the Scripture Subiects may learne their dutie to Magistrats and namelie Churchmen. Submissiue loyalty, obeysance due, But Church men chiefly, by ambition blind, Whom Christ fore-seing should affect to find Worldlie Preheminence, Respect and Place, Aspire the steps of Sov'raignety to trace; That ONE aboue the rest, should, (thus made weake,) The yock of Civill Iurisdiction shake From scornefull shoulders, raysd those Men aboue Whom God hath called Gods, (how ere they proue In this submission lesse then Men,) to beare, Exod. 12. 13; 22. 28. In Princelie Pow're, His Royall Image heere, Though therefore He exemption might haue pleaded, And not beene Caesar's Tributary needed To teach obedience, yet, to Subjects true, Would giue to Caesar what was Caesar's due. Mat. 22. 21; Rom. 13. 7. And, though hee might attaynd haue to a crowne, Himselfe made Great by throwing Others downe, Iohn 6. 15. To voluntary offers giving eare Of such, repining Caesar's yoke to beare, As gladly would haue Insurrection made, Conspird by arms a bloodie cause to plead, Yet did He flye; and, (by exemple rare), To solitarie Desarts to repare Preferring, did all loyall Subjects teach To shunne Seditioun, though a Crowne to reach. Yea when His life was most vnjustlie sought, A Weapon to bee drawne He suffred nought In His defence, but chuisd Himselfe alone To suffer, rather than by armes oppone The Lawfull Magistrat, so authorize Seditious men, for private Injuries Persu'd by Iustice, who dare set their face Against their Prince or Deputs in his place. Not of this world His Kingdome He profest, To conquesse rents and Lands Him troubled least. Men's soules alone He sought, and these to saue; No Prince by Him did prejudice receaue, By civile challenge, by pretended right, By open violence, or secret slight. Let Church-men follow as Hee did preceed, In Imitation of their Lord and Heed, Or quite the false pretence themselves to call His Servants, while with Him at strife they fall, Proudly practizing what they contrare find, Both to His Mouth's direction and His minde, For, (bee they sure), no Titles of respect, No rev'rend Stiles which proudlings so affect, No name of Fathers in his house, no place Of Honour, which so eagerlie they chace, No scugge of Peters chayre, no vaine pretence Of powre, by soveraigne preheminence, No casting out of devills shall ought availe, Preaching nor wonders working; all shall faile Proud wordlings from that dreadfull doome to saue: I know you not; with mee no part yee haue. Luke 13. 27. As Subjects Him beholding humbled, see Kings and rulers may learne their dutie by looking vpon Christ's purtrate in the Scripture. A pearlesse Patterne of true loyaltie, So Kings may looking on this King of Kings, Who proudest Tyrants in subjection brings, Learne to be truly Royall, Rule as Hee To whom all earthly Monarchs vassels bee. As Subjects prosper best, when to their King They Loyall proue, and to his Lawes to bring Obedience due no paynes esteeme too great, The well to establish of His royall State, So Princes then, when Subjects good they proue To Iesus Christ, a King all Kings aboue, His Kingdome seeking to advance, to plant Relligion in Their bounds, thence to supplant Contemners of His lawes, his Throne enlarge, With noble Artaxarxes giving charge Ezra 7. 23. That what enjoynd is by the God of Heaven His House concerning, Order may bee given It to performe with speed, wrath to keepe backe, Which may the Realme, the King, his Sonnes o'retake. Let Kings behold this King, how Hee who stands Nor by His Subiects' wisdome, wealth, nor hands, Yet so doth seeke the wellfare of their State, As if, they weakned, hee could not bee Great; Behould, how Hee All such as dare injure, The hurt or Prejudice of His procure, Foes to Himselfe professing: no pretence Of fayned friendship, show of Innocence Admittance finding to abuse His Eare, All Flatt'rers false defended to draw neare, Whom Hee will, (on day,) to their endlesse shame, (As if He them had never known,) disclame. As David than, to whom God's Counsells deepe Revealed were, of this true King the Type, Looking vpon the Prototype, His Lord, His Kinglie Carriage did to His accord; Learnd God His Ioy to make; God's Law alone Psal. 101. v. 1. His Rule, in life, and in Relligion; v. 2. Apostasie and Apostats to hate, v. 3. And every wicked man, or Meane or Great: v. 4. All such to curbe: the Godlie in their place v. 6. As Favourits, Friends, Counsellers to grace, Raysd to preferment, in his Eyes to stand; GOD'S foes degraded, rooted from the Land; v. 8. So let all Kings, anoynted from aboue, GOD for their Portion, David's Lote who loue, Him who doth both vnscepter and enstall Beholding, learne to do the like in all. Let every Soule in end, of what condition Every estate may profite by looking on Christ in the Scripture. Of mind or case of present disposition Of Body, goods, or name, of what degree, Sexe, age, estate or Ranke so-ere they bee, Seeke by the eye of liuelie Fayth to looke On Christ, described in the sacred Booke Of God's two Testaments, the Mirror true From whence alone reflects His perfite view, And All in Him, (if rightlie seene,) shall find For each defect of Bodie or of minde Some seasonable good, some soveraine cure To doe away in them sinne's spots impure. No looke on Him shall bee bestou'd in vaine, For Hee in Mercie shall looke backe againe, And from each looke shall liuelie vertue flow, Which difference sufficient shall show Twix Christ (aright) thus by His owne Means sought, And that deceaving, shamefull Idole, brought In place of Christ, as Christ to bee adord, And (now) is by deluded soules implord For Christ, and cald, (what blasphemie more vile?) By Christ's owne personall and proper stile. Which things, as more than equall to my strength, The particulare vses of Christ's discription in the Scripture left to preachers. I leave to Preachers to informe at length, Whose Calling is, (not in the Bed of slouth Reposing), from the Chayre of sacred Truth That Lambe of GOD, by Scriptures, to point foorth, That Treasure of vnestimable worth Mat. 13. 44. Hid in the Gospels' field in sight to set, Whence needie soules may lasting riches get, CHRIST, sacrifizde for sinners, to present, (By preaching of His death and Testament,) Vnto their peoples' eyes, by vses due Quickning dead soules vnto obedience new. O, that not Pastors may a few bee found, Gold, pretious stones, who building on this GROVND, 1 Cor. 3. 12. With hearts right set, their Maister's will to know, Him to their flocks may chieflie strive to show, His Honour, and safetie of his Sheepe Preferring to what els the world doth keepe. As CHRIST to All Himselfe a patterne gaue, Christ a pattern to preachers in a speciall maner. To These so chieflie Charge of soules who haue, Hee, not Himselfe Intruding, sent from Heaven, As Aaron cald vnto the Iews was given, Heb. 5. 4. To Them the Gospell's joyfull news to preach: Thus in God's House no charge at all to teach Place ought to haue, but such, (by God designd,) As warrant doe from His apointment find, And that in such None ought themselues to thrust, Iohn 10. 1, 2. But whom alone GOD daind hath to entrust With His Commission, in His worke to sweate, Found Messingers for His Embassage meet, Who, scorning Means which worthlesse men doe make, By doore of lawfull calling Entrie take. The charge to beare of GOD'S peculiar flock Thus when thrust foorth, the Truth of God Hee spoke, Him in Commission given, and still did care Iohn 12. 29. Of all His words, God's word to make the square. No sinne Hee spard, Him No man's face did feare; Hee neither whipt in spleene, nor did forbeare For favour; so their saftie might bee wrought, Men's well and not to please their will he sought. Glory of men Hee gloryed not to get, Iohn 7. 18. Nor Honour to Himselfe Himselfe did set To purchase, (though to Him was due by right All Glory, Honour, Majestie and might), To seeke GOD'S honour was his maine intent Him who to Labour in His Harvest sent. No curious Phrase, applause of men to breed, (To Ignorants one with an vncouth leid,) No Eloquence of words, no swelling stile Did from His mouth His flock of foode beguile; In all Simplicitie, in termes most plaine, His minde He vttred, to the vulgar braine And Iudgement weake of All Himselfe applying Eares had to heare, vpon His charge relying. To further man's Salvation Hee did spare Paynes, nor by night nor day, nor late nor ayre. His meate, his drink it was, soules home to bring, Iohn 4. 34. His Father's will to doe in everie thing. Wordlie Preferment, Honours, Titles, Place, Hee did not with ambitious wordlings chace, But vtterlie refusde, and lookt afarre On what so ere his maine Intent might marre. With things His Presence which did not exact, Or from a better worke Him might destract, Hee did no meddle, would no lay aside His Calling, matters civill to decide, Though in pretence twixt Brothers peace to make Luk. 12. 13, 14. Vrg'd, Hee the Iudge's office did forsake. His Preaching while Impugnd by sinners bold, Hee suffred patientlie to bee controld, Heb. 12. 3. Mat. 22. 15. Mark 12. 13. Luke 20. 20. Not with the obstinate by Iangling vaine To tempt Him set, and of his words to gaine Advantage, Hee by dispute did contend: Or peace Hee keept, or some few words did spend Sufficient to convince, the Conscience check Of such as thus their Envy durst detect. When as not loyall scandalizd, hee pleads Luke 23. 2. Fidelitie, in suffring, doctrine, deeds, Though King of Kings, repining not to bee, 1 Tim. 6. 13. Heere subject to Supreme Authoritie. When to the Romane Governour accusd As on whose doctrins false the world abusd, A good Confession witnessing, Hee stoode 1 Tim. 6. 13. Fast for the Truth, and seald it with His bloode. To this His Patterne, perfitlie espyd, If true conformitie had beene applyd, His Vicar, Him at least who steales this stile, But from His life and doctrine doth resile, Those Evill offers never had entisd, Mat. 4. 8, 9. Nor bad condition, by our Lord despisd. Nor should ambitious Men, puft vp with pride, With loue of worldlie Glory led aside, Haue turnd, their Earthlie pompe to entertaine, CHRIST'S Heavenly Kingdome in a temp'rall Raigne. Nor should the Dragon's taile haue drawne from Heaven, Apoc. 2. 4. (By greed of gaine, and filthie lucre driven,) So many Stars to Earth, and earthlie wayes, Depriving both of light and heat their Rayes. Nor should vaine Men, in damnable pretence Of Pietie, with windie Eloquence And falsely cald Philosophy, haue dard Themselues to Preach, of GOD the Truth haue mard. Nor should such Errors, breeding onlie gaine To blinded Guids of a deluded Traine, Haue Scriptures made despisd, so farre suspect, And Toyes and Trifles cary such respect. Strengthen, Lord Iesus, and stretch foorth thine hand To ayde thy Servants, for thy cause who stand, And reddy are to suffer fyre and sword For Thee, thy Truth, and credite of thy Word. Sufficient Workmen in thy Harv'st thrust foorth, Fitted for those pernitious Times in worth: Come clense thy Kirk, discover by degrees The Man of Sinne, to All whose darkned eyes, Blind to discerne, yet can not truelie see Midst such a glorious Sunne-shine, who is Hee. Thine owne deare Lambs set free, who captives lye, Which chains of Ignorance and Error tye; That hence, (no more in by-paths led astray) Iohn 14. 6. In seeking Thee, the Truth, the Life, the Way, Their Crucifixes faind they may disclame, And of their Idols and false Christs thinke shame. Amongst their hands, their hearts lift up to Heaven, Where Truelie Thee to see by Faith is given, To All, that in the Means ordaind by Thee, With Souls right set, seeke in Sinceritie. ???? ???? ???. God forbid that I should rejoyce, but in the Crosse of our LORD Iesus Christ, Whereby the World is crucified vnto mee, and I vnto the World. Gal. 6. 14. SONNETS Sonet 1. While (mine owne glasse), vpon myself I looke, Examining how (heere) my part is plaid, Reading in conscience's accusing Booke, Of pretious Time how meane account I made, What hideous Formes my frighted Eyes vpbrade, Reflecting from the Mirror of my mynd: Abortiue Flowrs which in the blossome fade, Most of my labours past, alone I find. Eternall Ivstice, Thou who (vndeclynd) To everie Worke proportions the Reward, Pittie my folyes past: with Sprite refynd So shall I praise Thee, who my paths repaird; So from Egyptian Brick and Clay set free, My Songs shall only, only bee of Thee. Sonet 2. Bvt while my Sprite aboue the spheares aspyres, And from the World would separation make, Myne Eyes repyning at my Soules desyres, With Lot's fond Wife, relenting looks cast backe. Thou, whose consuming breath her soyle did sacke, All Lets, my flight which doe empeach, remove: Wing my affection that in word, in act, From Earth sequestred I may vpwards move, There, where around Thee, Wisdome, Iustice, Loue. Truth, Mercie with extended wings, abide, With numbrous hostes all number farre aboue, Of Sprites which in eternity them hyde: O lead me thither, thither make mee runne: Perfite thy worke, (Good Lord), in mee begunne. Sonet 3. My wayes, my wandrings all to Thee are knowne, No strength to stand (Lord) of my selfe I haue; I breath in bondage, so am not mine owne, Emancipat to Sinne, so Sathan's slave. No stinking carion, halfe consumd in graue, My leprous soule in loathsomenesse exceeds. Thy glorious Image how defacd I haue While I record, my heart for horror bleeds. Sweete Reconcealer, Thou who pardon pleads To sin-chargd soules, which, faynting, groane for grace, Thy Mercie measure not with my misdeeds; Thy wandring chyld, turnd home at length, embrace, Who brutishly mongst beasts, (with ackorns fed), Too long, a shamefull, swynish life haue led. Sonet 4. O Three times happie, if the day of grace In my dark soule did, (though but dimly), dawne; If to my strugling thoughts proclaimd were peace; If from mine eyes the vaile of darknesse drawne; If once the seed of true Repentance sawne Made gushing streames leave furrowes on my face; Sinne's menstruous rags in pure transparent laune Were chang't; O then how happie were my cace! So darknesse paths no more my feete should trace, So ever on a quyet conscience feast. Repentance planted so should vice displace, So clenst from sinne, sinne's filth I should detest, Grace, Light, Repentance, inward peace I crave, Grant these, good Lord, for mee thy selfe who gave. Sonet 5. Awake mee, (Lord,) from fancie's charming dreame, My Sprit rowze vp from lethargie of sloath: With doubled pace, O give mee to redeeme My time mispent, the errors of my youth. Hence let my taske bee thy eternall Truth, Free from vaine fictions of distempred brains: Grant what Thou addst vnto my years of grouth Good seed may prove, cast on more fertile plains. Set to the key of grace, tune all my straines From lawlesse stryfe, fred from conceits prophaine, Which poyson doe with gall the sweetest veines, And, with the Sprit of lyes, most sprits enchaine. My sprit with thine inspire; on wings mee raise. Lord, henceforth let my tongue sound foorth thy praise. Sonet 6. Since that vast orbe, which doth the rest embrace, More swift than thoght still whirls about times wheele; Since years' serpentine course, with speedy pace, Doth a continuall revolution feele; Since houres still slyde, still life away doth steale, Why then, my soule, heere art thou luld asleepe? As if on Earth's low stage were placd thy Well, In streams of slyding pleasurs drencht too deepe: Breake off thy dreame: from world's basse fetters creepe, Thy soveraine Good with eyes vnsyld to view: Ryse from earth's vaile to climbe that Mountaine steepe, The only station of contentment true. Sooth no thy selfe, my soule; shake of delay: Life's Flowre both spreidth and fadeth in a day. Sonet 7. As waue doth waue, so day doth day displace; Time's clock goes quickly: Moments swiftly slyde: The longest Age scare doth a minut's space, If with eternity compaird, abyde. Yet Mortals, charg'd with madnesse, fraught with pryde, Day-livers, dreame to see the world's last date: Guyle held no guilt, craft they with craft doe hyde, Sinne heap on sinne, deceat vpon deceat; No paine is spair'd to gaine the name of Great, Prizde with contempt, aym'd at by few, is Good But Ah! and buildst thou vp a slipry state With pressing vsury, with bribes, with bloode, Madde Man, yet dost not, neither wilst take heede, Thy Life ore hell hings by a slender threed. Sonet 8. If Lines which Sphears in equall shares divyde, But once the Center, twice the Circle touch, Like slow-pac'd snails, why then still doe wee crouch, Still craule on earth, on earth still grov'ling bide? Let fayth our flight aboue Heaven's circuits guide Where wee should dwell, redoubling our desires. The Doue, no rest heere finding, streight retyres, But in our Prison plac'd is all our pride. As all the vast inferiour orbs of Heaven, By proper pace, vnsensibly are rold, But hurld about, with motion vncontrold, Are by the Highest violently driven, O Mover first, let mee thy motion proue In grace, who rather retrograde than moue. Sonet 9. A constant course, heere, Lord each creature keeps, Not swarving from thine ordinance their ends: Earth vnsustained stands, in showrs ayre weeps, Fyre vpward, water to the Center tends. The Sunne in his Ecliptick, mounts, descends, Oblicklie runnes, with Tropics two confynd, Whose course the years alternat seasons sends; Seas ne're transgresse the Limits thou assing'd. But Man, in whom thy vive Character shynd, That lytle World, of all thy works a Breefe, Made Lord of All, of all hath most declynd From thy obedience. O tears! O griefe! Man to the Angels whom Thou didst preferre, From his Creation's end doth only erre. Sonet 10. My lif's fraile Barge, with an impetuous tyde, Is on this world's tempestuous Ocean tost: For me, as for our second Sire, provyde A saving Ark, O Lord, or I am lost. Or as thy people, (while proud Pharaoh's hoast Seas overwhelmd,) through floods firme passage fand. A Vessell weake, Mee save, at too much cost Redeem't to bee depriv'd of promis'd Land. As earst to Peter, Lord, streach foorth thine hand, On liquid floare while as his fayth did faynt: Let not betwixt mee and thy mercie stand That I a sinner vile, hee liv'd a Saint. Thy Glorie greater, greater is thy praise, Mee a dead Lazare, from sinne's grave to raise. Sonet. To the Blessed Trinitie. Essence vnmov'd, whose Word made all things move, Earth's pondrous Orbe midst Ayre who ballanst even, By Discords sweete, who tun'd the ten-stringt Heaven, God rich in Mercie, infinite in Love, Light out of Light, O life who death didst prove, Lost Earthlings to redeeme, depriv'd of grace; Child full of wonder, glorious Prince of Peace, Begotten, from Eternitie, aboue; O Holy Ghost, sweete sanctifying Sprit From both proceeding: All, in essence One, Most sacred Triade: first and last alone, Three vndividuall, Trinally vnite, Father, Sonne, Holy Ghost, God, One in Three And three in One! for ever blessed bee.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II A Covnter-Bvff to Lysimachus Nicanor; Calling himself a Jesuite By PHILOPATRIS Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos Ducit, &amp; immemores non sinit esse sui. I cannot now but give my grief a tongue, Since innocence, and vertue suffer wrong; Since calumnie, and falshood strive to wound Our Mother's breast, and purpose to confound That Covenant, the Popish hyrelings' foyle, Heaven's herauld sent to blesse North-Britain's soyle: A band of truth and power, the Prelats' baine, Which with our dearest bloud we will maintaine, As sworne, God's purer worship to defend, Our King to serve, our straying faults to mend. Illustrius Trajan, though a pagane prince, After much bloud of Christians, did dispence With the remainder of that Heaven-blest band, Who through a Red sea fraungh'd their long'd-for land, Whiles by Proconsull Plinie he was inform'd, Plinius secundus That Christians in their lives were more reform'd, Nor then was vented forth, by false report, And that, in sober way, they did resort To privat meetings, whereunto their God They sweetly sang some divine hymne or ode, Committing nothing worthie Cæsar's wrath. Whence all inditements, sentences of death, Were straight repeal'd, and Christians were set free, Dispenc'd to brook peace, truth, and libertie. The like our hope and trust assures us, shall Unto our native homebred Cæsar fall: Whiles by some worthie Plin', it shall be told him, That in the armes of love we still infold him, That the pure incense of our sacred prayers, Maugre the spite and pryde of all gainsayers, Is daily for his safety powred forth, And since no earthly thing is of more worth, Nor life and fortunes, we shall both imploy, For thryce-blest Charles, the center of our joy: So that we brook in full integritie, With peace and truth, our ancient libertie. Then false Lysimachus, thou runnigate, That seems to pry into the soule of state, That personates a subtile Jesuite, And yet art known a homebred parasite, That hath belcht forth a rapsodie of lies, And, 'gainst thy Countrey, false coyn'd calumnies: Thou, by our Statutes, hast deserv'd to die An ignominious death; for such a lie, As may breed discord twixt the King and State, Is death: here many laws I may repeat, And practicks too, but these are all so clear, As need no glossing: Onely I will here M. Thomas Rosse. Touch one for all: A Scot of ancient race, A schollar too, as thou art, liv'd a space In England's Court, and, for some privat hate, A pasquill did against his Countrey wreat, As thou hast done in fouler sort, more full Of vil'd aspersions, from thy phrantick skull. Well then, King James of lasting memorie, Who could not brook that any calumnie Should be asperst upon his native land, After some tryall there, he gave command, The Lybeller should home go, and sustaine, Of doome unpartiall laws th' unpitied paine; And here being try'd, judg'd and adjudg'd, they fand, That he should losse his head, and faultie hand, Which straight was done in publick view; and so I thinke the matter with thy self will go. For we do sure expect our Soveraigne Will send thee home, that here thou may'st sustaine Due punishment: But since that thy offence Is worse nor his, the judges may dispence With heading's blow, and make thee climbe the top Of some curst tree; come down into a rope. Nor shall this one jest more in silence rote, Which carelesse I, had now almost forgot, Of a Polonian Swaine, more curious Nor wise or learn'd, call'd Stercovius. Hither he came clade all in antique sort, Where seen in streets, the subject of a sport He soone became to childish gazers, who With skriechs and clamours hiss him to and fro, Till forc'd he was with shame and speed to pack him, And to his feet and loathsome cabin take him: Where in a furious and chollerick mood, He nothing breath'd but fire, revenge and bloud, And fondly swore, our nation's overthrow He should adventure, with a suddain blow Of his both pregnant and pernicious pen, Like to a fierce and fearfull powder traine. Thus, fraught with furie, home to Pole he goes, To wreak his splen on his imagin'd foes: And there his pen he loos'd, and with more spite, Nor hell had taught him thoughts, he did indite A legend of reproaches, stuf't with lies; Was bold to print, and vent those calumnies Against the Scots, their manners and their fame, Of purpose to obscure their splendide name, In all that Esterne clyme, and tract of ground, Where squadrons of our Nation did abound; Whence some choise men of ours did take in hand, To supplicat the Princes of that land, Their wrong for to redresse: so with great paine, Great search, and length of time their point they gaine, For all vaste Teuton's states, the Spruch, the Dan, Dispatch, and arme with power some trustie man, Stercovius to pursue in any ground, Take and arraigne him where he may be found; Which is with great turmoile and travell done, Yet things well acted are performed soone: For this slie fox, hunted from hole to hole, At length is catch't, and unresolv'd did thole His head divorce, which from his body fell Low to the ground, his soule I cannot tell Which way it went, for most unworthie I, That should into th' Eternal's secrets pry. Now, since by law of Nations, forraigne Princes Haue granted patents throughout their Provinces, A slanderer thus to take and apprehend, Who did a stranger Nation vilipend, What shall our Soveraigne do? when it be's known, How falsely thou hast lyed against thine own. But now thy piece I must anatomize, And try with Linxe's sight what therein lyes; First, for the bulk, though spacious to the eye, It's pesterd with a full hydropisie, And from a liver rotten, drencht, and spent, Poyson for bloud throughout the veines are sent: The frontespiece unmaskes an hypocrite, While thou strives to play the Jesuite, Whence in egregious sort, thou lies, and fails In every point of thy false paralels: Daring compare our true reformed land, Unto the bloud-hound, hell-inspired band Of those, who still are hatching dreadfull things, And hunt the precious lives of sacred Kings. Next, with what impudent and flintie face Thou makes the bloudy league, a leading cace To our blest Covenant, the powerfull mean, God and our King's true service to maintain. For, if that league was not a monster made, A French-like body, with a Spanish head, Which broach'd that traiterous blot by hel's devise, To shake, and sack the glorious flowre de Lice. They traitours were, time's stories sure relate, To God and man, to Prince and to the state: We paternes here of love, of truth, of zeal, Oppos'd right in a contrare paralell, Have vow'd, and sworne our lives and goods to spend, God's truth, our Prince, and countrey to defend: So are thy words like flowres but sap or roote, Which onely to repeat, is to confute. Again thou says't we sympathize with thee, And strive t' ecclypse the rayes of Majestie, Pressing what's proper unto God alone, A Monarch's sacred person to dethrone; Of independent power him to deprive, And call in doubt his high prerogative, To this our talion statute, we oppose, Which doth as treason hatchers judge all those, T. 6. p. 11. c. 49. Who dare accuse, and cannot prove a treason: Thus guiltie thou's be found by law and reason. For since an hundred and eight kings haue sent, To royall Charles a pierlesse monument, A crown untoucht, since famous Fergus' hand, First heald the helme of our sea-bordering land; And that twixt us and England rivall hate, Like time spent Almanacks, worne out of date, Is turn'd to peace, hatch'd in Eliza's raigne, And consummate by our blest Soveraigne, Thrice sacred James, that heaven-predestin'd one Who should rule Brittaine, long dis-joyn'd, alone: And that by Charles' late raigne, that loue knot tyde, Should while as time doth last, unloos'd abide: We here before th' Almighty now protest, And by Him swear, that in our loyall breast So damn'd a devilish thought did never enter, But full resolv'd, shall life and all adventure, T' uphold the pillars of that Monarchie, Which destin'd was by Heaven, great Charles for Thee, Brook't by so many kings, thy brave forbears, Now thirty lesse then twice a thousand years: Nor that against our neighbours was intend, Any invasive power or force to send, But In defence, our royall emblam'd word; A Lyon crownd, a Scepter, and a Sword, Adorne our armes unstain'd, since Alexander Began to kythe, the Eastern world's commander: A Thistle here is seen, and seems this way, None can unpunisht me provoke, to say; Of all these Mottos here unfold the sence, We take no armes but in our just defence: If England will invade, untwist that band, Which long hath keept the one and other land In peace and love, and on our bounds encroach, By sea or land, we must byde their reproach; And then our courage taught by wit and skill, And skill by courage arm'd, resolve we will The hazard of a war to under go, And set our face 'gainst our invading foe. The world's great Judge no doubt, in whom we trust, Will be our safe-guard, as our cause is just; By him confirm'd, unmoveable we stand, And shall preserve our never conquer'd land. A multitude fit and compos'd in armes, T' invade, or to repell by force all harmes, Lips. de militia Rom. dial. 2. Under a certain law, an armies call'd; We on this part defensive, unapal'd, Resisting force, are forc'd to take in hand This war, to brook the freedome of our land, As our ancestors old, of farre-spread name, Who trac'd in true record of endlesse fame, Have left that Jewell, unstain'd libertie, To be enioyed by their posteritie. And should not now their fair example tye us, Though all the furies were let loose to try us, The same to doe, and to our offspring leave, What from our fathers old we did receave; Lest they should curse these dismale dayes, and say, We did Religion and our State betray. But O, His colours shine into the field, To whom we should our lives and fortunes yeeld, And not resist, our answers short and plaine, Which as the law of nature all maintaine, To be eternall, sure and immutable, A vniversall law, just, firme, and stable: Whence flows that source of laws, which bindeth all, Of Nations, civil, and municipall, What men intend, (to keep this sweet soft breath Unharm'd by fierce assaults of threatning death) Is done by law, and may in their defence, L. 3. F. de Just. &amp; jure. L. Scientiæ 49. § 4. F. ad L Aquil. Arm'd force repell, by force and violence: And so defend we should, being forc'd thereto, And in this case all's lawfull that we do. All faire means are assay'd, our Prince to please, We bend our thoughts the Lyon's wrath t' appease, And in a most obsequious Sympathie, We supplicat for peace, we call, we crie, Which if it please him flately to refuse, By this necessity, we cannot chuse But rise in lawfull armes, and not neglect Religion, Laws, and Countrey to protect. A wise man should, the Comick sooths it so, Terent. Try every way before to armes he go; For by one tempest of a civil broyle, Which riseth in a late calme, settled soyle, The Prince is more prejudg'd, nor granting to them Much libertie; yea, though he should undo them, He's sharesman of the harme, can but obtaine, In end with certain losse, uncertain gaine. Bacon. Essay 29. A forraigne war was well compar'd of late, To heat of exercise into a state; But bad distempers of intestine warre, Like to those bloud-corrupting fevers are; Then if whole Brittaine in cumbustion be, It followeth sure, the head cannot be free: For in each symptome of a sharpe disease, The head doth with the body sympathize. O had I here the power, the place, the skill, To vent my well-set thoughts, as I have will, By truth emboldned then, I should explaine Our countrey's case to my dread Soveraigne; Shew him the pathway, for his joyes' encrease, To solace in the multitude of peace, To keep that band untwist, his people's love, Which is the surest tye a Prince can prove: Let pure Religion strength and vigour take, By reason of a state-confirmed act: Give way to justice, and our laws restore Unto the sence and force they were before: Banish foule gamesters flatly from the play, And chase ear-pleasing sycophants away: Unmask their face, and to a tryall bring, The source from whence these poysoned waters spring: And namelie this, and such false lybellers, Seditious sowers of mischief and jarres: Then our inlightned King with favour's eye, Through clear, not gommie spectacles, shall see Of loyall Subjects, here a heaven-blest brood, In faith, Religion, and alleadgeance good: Then shall Jehova shoure on him his grace, And breath to all his Kingdomes truth and peace: And whiles the sun, light to the world shall bring, A race of Kings from forth his loyns shall spring. Those mang-merd priests, drunk with the dregs of sin, Rabelais cals them so. When they a novice to confesse begin, They make him first bread-band his guiltinesse, And all his sinfull thoughts, words, deeds expresse: This done, they tax and charge him with such crimes, As never practis'd were in former times; Thus, to that youngling sins are taught and shown, Which heretofore were neither heard nor known. So, by that other paralell of thine, Thou cals in question if by power divine, Or people's suffrage, Monarchs are inthron'd, By whom, and why uncrown'd, and how repon'd; But whiles thou seems t' unmask a veritie, Thou over-shades the royall Majestie, And in quottations hath so farre deborded, That people will beleeve what is recorded, They'le tender all thou sayest, and not purloyne, But take these vented pieces for good coyne, Their faith is stung, they'le surely trust these men, So Naive-lie represented by thy pen: And if these errours be, thou dost unfold them, For men cannot beleeve what's never told them. Those tender points thus prest, and other things, Shall make thee sure, a darling unto Kings: But when thy stuffe be's tryde by Lynxe's eye, Thou shalt as thou deserves exalted be, As Haman was, great in Assuerus' Court: But, as thou scoffes a Prince, thou makes a sport Of sacred Scripture, and a nose of wax, Causing her rayes on dunghills to reflex: Thus God, the King, Nobles, and people be Scorn'd, wrong'd, detract'd, and rail'd upon by thee; What this deserves, let justice to it look, There needs no ditty, but cast up thy book. Yet, since thou didst divinity professe, As by those ragged rapsodies I guesse, From David's mouth thine errours I proclaime, Unto the world, ar symbols of thy shame: First, in a scorner's chaire thou sits, and thus Psal. 1. 1. Thou art denyde these blessings powr'd on us. Did ever scorne flow from so foule a mouth, As his, who flouts and scoffes God's sacred truth? And next, thou shalt not in God's tents abide, Nor in his all o're-topping hill reside, Since thou has loos'd the arrows of thy tongue, Psal. 15. 3. And done thy Countrey and thy neighbour wrong. King David hates a two tongu'd hypocrite, Ps. 26. 4. And these that in malicious lyes delite; Thou stiles thy self a Jesuite, and so For a disguised lyar thou must go. That Kingly prophet truely hath foretold, Ps. 31. 18. That thy sharp'd tongue, which is, and hath been bold The righteous to traduce, shall silenc'd be. Hath not this judgement justly ceas'd on thee? And of those curses thou shalt have a share, Ps. 35. 11. Which 'gainst false witnesses pronounced are. Thou art a witnesse false, and strives to move Our Prince to quite his ancient Kingdome's loue. Thou are prohibit with thy lips profane, God's sacred will and precepts to explaine, Psal. 50. 16. Since thou hast darted flames of infamie, Against their fame, who brethren were to thee. Ps. 50. 20. But here I pause, and leaves the rest to those, Who, more exact, can pay thee home in prose, Who shall uncace thy waires, let all men know That they be not upright though seeming so: I'le onely point at some unwarrant'd places, Which 'mongst thy Paralels thou interlaces, In down right termes, in speeches plain and free, Thou dares defend that thrice damn'd Liturgie, Which had almost intoxicate our State, But is abolish'd and supprest of late, Which is in sound, in sence, in words expresse, The smooth fram'd modell of an English masse. Yet thou forsooth, must by thy pen defend it, Though King and Church hath simply it suspendit: Thus sure thou wouldst, if urg'd thereto, maintaine, The Jewish talmude, Turkish alcorane. In these fore-going theams, thou proves that we Paral 2. Preasse to supplant a sure-fixt Monarchie. But in the following head, thou speaks beguesse, Paral 3. And leaves the great point, brands us with the lesse, Forgetfull that a base and lying slave, A good and ready memorie should have; In this our hainous cryme thou qualifies, And looses some small shots of calumnies, Where greatest should be last, shows our intent, To loose the raynes of Church governement, That Church affairs should not be rull'd by Kings, With many moe absurd, and futill things, So that thou seems to quite, what's first and past, Epanor-thosis. And, by correcting, takes thee to the last. But to that speech we answer all in one. Our King's chief ruler of the Church alone, And hath such power in that government, J. 6. p. 18. c. 1 &amp; p. 20. c. 6. As is explain'd by acts of Parliament, From which true Subjects never can debord. So of both states he is the Soveraigne Lord. Then with a daring boldnesse, thou reviles That sacred name, and with base skurrill stiles (Though in a roguish, comick, jesting sort) Thou makes of it a sceane, a skuff, a sport, And calls him onely executioner Pag. 11. Of laws, and worse, a servile officer, Or H. and least that this for thine should go, Thou scoffing tells that men will say it's so: Thus trac'd thou hast, by thy pernicious pen, What never yet was said or thought by men. A fellow here was pinioned on hie, This was Ard. Cornuall, a town officer. Convict for high contempt of Majestie, Whiles his Prince' portrature, expos'd to seal, He on a gibbet hung, fixt with a naile: And though the poore soule harbour'd no intent His King to wrong: yet his dire punishment (So precious is the shadow of a King) Was seal'd, that he on that curst tree should hing, And that the long-fixt tree should be o'rethrowne, Burnt, and its ashes in the aire be blowne; How can our Prince then brook that round-spun speech, Whiles thou makes men compare him to an H? Till the like doome passe on thy book and thee, As on that pannell and his fatall tree. Then thou at randome runnes in full carriers, Darting thy spite against our noble Peirs; Against our Pastours and the common sort, Extracts the Chimick substance of a sport: And like that houling hel-hound Cerberus, Thou barks not simply at our cause, and us, But dares disgorge thy hell invenom'd splen Against the splendor of heroick men. Shall famous Lesly now became the scope Of thy envy, or thinks thou to unprope His sure fixt worth, whose truely noble spirit, Whose wit-mixt valour, whose transcending merit, Hath imp't his vertue in the wings of fame, And rear'd eternall trophies to his name; Is tryde to be, and so styl'd in all parts, A never conquer'd, conquerour of hearts; Is woo'd by kings, who would their states assure From all disasters, so they could procure His stay with them, (by his directive aid) In all exploits to be their martiall head. Then here thy tainted conscience is appeal'd, If thou esteem him truely paralel'd, With damn'd Loyola, authour of that sect, Who did such hyreling as thy self infect With bloud-imbrued maximes of Estate; For that red front, thy war presaging hate, The programe of thy book, declares a will, So thou hadst power thy mother's bloud to spill: Since each draught of Loyola limn'd by thee, And thus compared, proves an arrant lie, As who would paralell this raying light, With that dark shaddow of the sable night, Or purer white with black, or good with evill, Man with a beast, an angel with a devill. It's known our Generall is of noble birth, Of famous parents sprung, in place and worth, Excelling whiles they liv'd: but in their son, Thryce happy two, that left us such a one; To whom the heavens their treasures did impart, A Cupid's body, and a Marse's heart; Of mixt heroick gifts a sympathie, Courage with grace, valour with modestie. Then like a swinish, base, pedantick slave, Thou makes thy snout dig in a Matron's grave, Rachel Arnot. Snuff at her asses, though now ne're there be, Since she did change her mansion lusters three. Blinde Mole taine in thy work, harsh screaching oule, Thou bankrupt, chyding beast, thou envy's soule, That strives to byte heaven's guest, a glorious ghost, Who in Coelestiall boures, amid the host Of glory raying angels, doth receave Such joyes as God can give or man can crave, Curst be thy pen, curst thy immortall hate, Levit. 19. 14. For envie should prove stingless after fate. So all thou writes are hellish calumnies, Which take their influence from the prince of lies: “Curse not the deaf,” (this sacred text I finde), “Nor cast a stumbling block before the blinde,” The Lord forbids thee this, (the precept's plaine): “I'le not obey,” thou answers him again, “But will offend and curse,” (thy words are clear) “The blinde and deaf, that neither see nor hear.” And thus far I: the rest I leave to those Whose divine thoughts and pen can well disclose Thy devilish caball, hell-inspired Art, And snares to trap thy mother, pierce her heart. Who thus complains of her unnaturall son, personating a Jesuite, and who hath dispersed (under that guise) false calumnies against the whole Estates of Scotland, and so deserves that punishment set down in Scripture. Exod. 21. 7. “That pasquiller that would me thus disgrace, And with such spyte, spit in his mother's face, God's curse attends him, threatned by his word; O then I crave, that Justice scales and sword May weigh and punish: may my native Prince Try and revenge his guilt and his offence. And now thou King of kings, inthron'd above, By whom Kings raigne, by whom they live and move, Inspire in my Prince' breast a sprite of peace, And shoure on him thy favours and thy grace, Command, Lord, thy Vice-gerent, tell him plain, He should thy truth, and calme of peace maintain. He cannot force belief, let him secure Thy divine worship here, as true and pure. Appease his wrath, let not my Lyon roare, Nor dart his thunder on his native shore, So we shall praise Thee, who for ever raignes, And whose transcending power all powers restraines.” Finis. Caledons Complaint Against infamous Libells. or A censure past upon the Truth-betraying Sycophant, dareing (most ignobly) to streck at the honour of this deeply afflicted Nation upon pretence of the guilt of rebellion, in justice to be represt by the power of his Majesties armes. Laid downe (with all submission) at the feete of our Soveraigne Lord King Charles What raging fury, Guest of horrid night, Comes arm'd with flames and snaikes against the Light, Loos'd from the chaines of darknesse to disturbe The sons of unitie, borne vice to curbe? By Law, not force, wee move, not tumult make, Wee Justice plead, Sedition doe forsake: None with rebellion our attempts will brand But who themselves to crush Religion band, By act, or by intent. Faire vertue shines, Reflecting everywhere from our designes: That whither forc'd, to arme, or to entreat, Our mildnesse, our Submission to bee great None can denie. For, so with Truth, sweete peace (Which in our chiefe desires hath chiefest place) Joyn'd hands; and did from Heaven salute this Land, Who could the excesse of his joy command? Who would not fall before his sacred Feete, Whom royal Vertues make a Prince compleete, And armes lay downe, or at his will employ, Lift Him to Honour, and his foes destroy: Who equall with his life his people's good, Would value, were they rightly understood. But by Religion's overthrow, to gaine Dishonourable ease, with Conscience staine; That truth be underminde by Policie, For Peace shoud wee dispence: Who can deny This cursed peace, this ignominious ease, Were high rebellion, would the Lord displease. Most sacred Soveraigne, honour of this Age, Thy Justice wee appeale, brought on the Stage By close Camelions; (foes who friendes appeare) Abusing our indulgence and thine Eare, Deserving on the parchment of their backe, The hang-man's whips, should in characters blacke Draw out each passage of those wicked arts, They us'd to wound thy grievous Subjects' hearts, And kindle in thy royall Breast a fire Which never can be quench'd, till thy just ire Their bloud doe expiate; till vengeance fall And, from the heavens, confound those fire-brands all. Lo! braine-sicke Cherelus dare brave our State, As at his fancie thy displeasure's spaite Were readie to breake forth. Darre hee repine That Light, throughout this glorious Yle doth shine, For which, too narrow Europ shall be found, Before the worke bee with the issue crown'd. Base lies now vents hee, now with malice stings Those honour'd Heraulds of the King of Kings; Chaifes, that from 'mongst our honey-bees wee drive Those Wasps, whose venome had infect'd the hyve. That wee, those limbs of Antichrist abjure, Unmitring monsters that did court the Whorre Of Rome, this Land adventuring to defile, And make, through their abominations, vile. Now, to our charge disloyaltie is laide, That (Parricids) wee dare the throne invade, Rob Caesar of his due, disclaime our head, And limits of alleadgeance doe exceed. O hight of hate! O hellish impudence! To thinke, that men of honour could dispence With conscience, with their duetie to a King, So good, so just, so wisely governing. Whose Love, as of a Father's, found we have, As of a Master wee his favour crave, His Aide as of a Lord; since Father's love, And Son's obedience, hand in hand doe move To homage and protection, mutually, Since true relation Prince and people tye. Thy countrey's heart doth bleed, her grieves are great, Both fraud and force conspire against her State. Her native liberties encroach'd on are, Which, gain'd with honour, honourably were From time to time maintain'd, against the pride, And power, of all that durst against her side. Her violated Lawes; the civill Right Of Subjects shaken; Justice, mar'd by might; Religion vex'd and wrong'd; (that sacred Band Of Amitie, and Union of the Land, The solide Pillar which the State sustaines, By which cemented, firme each piece remains;) Christ's cause, yea Crowne, in question; by the bands Of duetie, by the pow'r put in thy hands, (The regall Scepter, Diadem, and Sword, In Faith's defence, entrusted by thy LORD) Conjure Thee, while the lowring Skies portend A Tempest, to the danger to attend, And wisely to His interest to advert, Who count will crave how acted is thy part. Those, whom eclipses, more than Sun-light please, (The birds of prey, which gape for gaine), Those flies Which feed upon infection and stinke, Our Camels, which but troubled streames can drinke, Division's Cataracts would open keep, And kindle quarrels which lye buried deep, That Brethren, Pillars of the royall Throne, By God, and Nature, under Thee, made one, One bundell of united shafts; a Band Not easie to be brash'd by stranger's hand, May (thus) be weakened, and receive a wound, Endangering both, which shall not soone be sound. But ah! to thinke, that Thou whose aide wee call, The people's Parent; Watch-man on our wall: The Geometrick point, with eaven Aspect, Bound all thy bounding Borders to respect; The Head, the Heart of the Republicke, made A God, a Judge, set over good and bade; That Thou thy royall Banners shouldst display, By Justice' Sword, to make thy passion way, Against a Nation from defection free, Who heavens dare face, for their integritie; O depth of woe! O hight of passing griefe! That Thine, who supplicate by Thee reliefe, Must arme: and at uncertaine bloud's expense, Bee forc'd unto an innocent defence. Dread Soveraigne, Son of Mars, if arme thou wilt, No drop of bloud let bee in Britaine spilt. March, and all Europe shall be put in fray, The Alpes, the Perinees, shall make Thee way. Thy neighbouring state, with Olives shall attend, Thy right's decision while thou dost suspend. The Rhine, whose streams are swolne with tears shall smile And fears of longer servitude exile. Rome's wals shall tremble, proud Madrid shall quaik, When with joynt-forces thou the fields shall take With warriours, more then men, thy Britanies bold Attended; who for feare nor force will fold. Thy sea-wall'd world huge colonies shall spair, For peopling kingdomes which usurped are By Tyrants bold and blinde, the foes of Truth. Yea, Thou shall lead, with Albion's choicest youth, (The worthies and the wits of either land) Our Archimeds, who with industrious hand Reach Nature's depths, reviving Dedal's arts. Thy Scots, with Gyants' hands and Lyons' hearts, Shall gallantly go on, who whiles they arme, Shall give at once the stroke and the alarme, And undismaid, at danger, death, or blows, Shall fall, like fire and lightning on thy foes. Thus shalt thou wing thy fame, and with skill'd hand, Divert the wakened humours of the land; And, to amazed Europ's terror, lead A mighty body, moving with their head. But base the snake is, which in splean doth smite A suffering nation with the hight of spite, Whom (so thou silent prove) here, shall not want In single person, Miriads, to daunt, And make the wretch, who with disgrace dare load Thy country, sing a shamefull Palinode. Or, if amongst us be the monster found, The mother's gorge that doth invade and wound, Not sticking superciliously, to breath Prodigious prognosticks of thy wrath, (As if the helme of government, to guide Were left to serve the passion and the pride Of desperat Sycophants, the coale which blow, Thee and the state, alike, to overthrow; Or of these neutrall Atheists, which frequent, Amphibion like, a doubtsome element,) A mother's curse let to the pit pursue This bowel-renting, base, ambiguous crew. Be Ligature, the dog's sad destinie, Who for our cure prescrives Phlebotomie. Whips for thy back (base miscre?t), kept on pay By hel's black officers; hold on thy way, Spite venome still, still vomit blasphemies, Thou Vertue canst not wrong with calumnies. Thy jaws thou openest like a sepulcher With presages which sad effects infer, Bad profite. Bloud and murther thou dost breath, As, if the issues darke of life and death, Of Tombs and Trophees, wounds and victorie, Were mere effects of pow'r or policie. Heavens, heavens avert, when like the glorious Sun Our daye's bright Planet hath his course begun, And like a Bride-groome his bed-chamber leaves, And comes to cure his native Delos' greeves, That hardy Phaetons, with might and maine Who ply the spurs, but cannot rule the raine, Get charge, to His, and to our danger great, To drive his royall chariot of state. Heavens, heavens avert, that in this Hemi-sphear A sad and ominous Eclipse appear; That Britaine's brightest eye an uncouth flame Should dazel: (such as to the nations came By bold Prometheus' stealth); should marre that light Whose purer rayes prevented day and night, Light of th' eternal truth; light, which did shine From mouths of all the Oracles divine, In alder times; and which high providence, Till time be gone, shall to all times dispense. Shine gloriously, great Monarch, who thy light Would lessen, let them perish in thy sight. The meaner fires, which of thy flames pertake, All in their orbs, their rendevous shall make, And doe thee homage and submission due, When Thou (appearing) shalt their day renew, And, by a long-expected Fiat, fill Their hearts with joy, which now thy frowns do kill, Which all attend, all humbly do intreat With suits by day, by night, reiterate. Thus shall thy glories grow; thus heavens shall blesse All thy endeavours; and all tongues expresse Thy Scotland blest, that hath a Prince brought forth Vnparallel'de; a people full of worth. Finis. THE Cry of Blood and of A Broken Covenant Written out at first upon the sad Relation of our late Soveraignes most treacherous and inhumane Murther. TO THE ROYALL MAJESTIE OF K. CHARLES THE II. King of Great Britaine, France and Ireland, &amp;??. Free Accesse (Sir) the Muses plead. Repute This boldnesse, as conceiv'd to contribute By Strong desires, that while all eyes observe Your Motions, famisht hopes no more may starve. God and your Kingdomes Call. The set tim's come For Christ, in your Dominions to make rowme. Beside our Violated Mariage-Band, Blood cryes for vengeance, 'gainst the Traytrous hand Of impious Parricids. To plead the last, And act for proper intrests, Christ's o'repast, Or judgt but next in order, (as a way Prepostrous) your designes endanger may. Go to, Brave Prince; by heavens thy Heart be gain'd, Seal'd for the Work, that (surety thus obtain'd) Thy hand attesting, Thine in Truth's defence Thy Standart may attend, with confidence. This Solstice breeds amazement: How all eyes Wait till thou mount thy Coach and climb the Skyes, That Influence and Vertue, issueing thence Inferiour Bodies, brought again to sense, Long in the generall death detain'd, may see Day once more dawne, renew'd by light from Thee. Weigh with delayes the consequences fear'd, Remembring, that attempts which scarce have dar'd Peep forth at first for their deformity, Have gain'd, upon acquaintance of the eye. And when to ripenesse and full strength attain'd, Smiles have alike and frownes been entertain'd. THE CRY OF BLOOD AND OF A BROKEN COVENANT. What horrid Actings force unwilling ears With worst of news? do fancies and fond fears Mock troubled minds? or doth a reall blow For preface passe to Albion's overthrow? Have Parricids, professing Brother-hood, The traiterous murther of our late King, most justly to be laid to heart, and duely resented. Put hand in Cæsar? shed his Royall Bloud? Low in the dust this Island's Glory laid And, at one stroak, her Children Orphans made? O Heavens! O Earth! heer I must pause a space. Grief's tide flows higher, then, in this sad case, Can calm'd be by expression: But, to speak, Allegiance pleads. Men soberest, minds most meek, Most free of passion, cannot but resent This high Injustice; yea, in freedome vent Their Thoughts, and what a dialect to use, This bloody prelude speaks. Then free-born Muse Tell Britaine, tell the World, that hence, in vain Treaties and parleyes to be suspected, the parties being in an unequall posture. Words shall be heard of any milder straine Then Martiall eloquence. In trumpets' sound Be Scotland's Musick henceforth deeply drown'd, Arms therefore necessary to be ordered and made use of as the God of Arms shall call for and imploy. From Heav'ns th' alarme, attended orders bee, All doubts discust, all judgments clear and free. Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your swords. Arme Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. 1 Sam. 25. 28; 2 Chr. 20. 15. For our Watchmen, the faithful MINISTRY. Lift up your voice, Cry Watch-men, cry aloud. Dangers and duties to be laid forth, and prest from clear, just, and convincing grounds. Religion suffers by Usurpers, proud, Of successe insolent. Now, Sion's plea In dispute is, the Glorious Liberty From trampling on Religion. Of Sacred Truth restrain'd, It's beauty marr'd; Prodigious Toleration boldly dar'd To be maintain'd. How men upon them take Despising of Dominion, everting of lawfull Government. The ground-work of just Government to shake, On Crowns to Trample, of due pow'r deprive All pow'rs, from them that pow'r do not derive? How languisheth the Work of God? His Cause From marring of God's work and shaming of the Covenant. Discountenanc'd? Divine and Humane Lawes All violate? How a reproach become Our solemne Covenant, abroad, at home? What grounds for reall fears? What snares contriv'd? From fears of further attempts, and proof of former snares; from practises against parliaments and domineering over God's Inheritance. How are of Righteous Priviledge depriv'd The highest Justice Courts? The honest side, Expos'd, as preys, to avarice and pride? Imprison'd, spoil'd, effronted, put to flight, Of lives and fortunes not secure one night. Then whether fury's drive? at Christ's own Throne From displaying of banners against the Son of God, whose enemies are our enemies, and with whose suffering members we are bound to sympathise. Strike not these Apostates? The Highest One Engag'd is in our quarrell. We, of late, Conceiv'd our losses and our suffrings great, While over-aw'd by Arms, till God arose, Made bare his Arme, and Proudlings did oppose; But Rods of Children, reck'ning, here, and there, We, but the finger, they the loyns do bear. Where now our fellow-feeling, former zeal? Shall in this exigent faith also fail? To you bold freedome fitly doth agree Joh. 8. 32, 33. Whom Truth in former Tryalls hath set free. Take, take your Watch-towre; thence, around you view As heavens give order, your Commission shew, Men of God's Counsell. God drives on designes And last, from God's purposed destruction of obstinate revolters against Truth and lawfull Authority, however imployed for our sins, as the rods of his just indignation. (In which, his Justice and deep wisdome shines) By men, whose wills his hand leads on to act His holy will, and guilty of the fact Them holds, as having byass'd from his ends, By other motions turn'd then he intends, And all for their just ruine. Whence to fire Shall Rods, when God's Commission doth expire. What stick we then? shall not the Lord bring down Perfidious Traytours to Christ Jesus' Crown? As clouds evanish, as the morning dew, As Chaffe, and chimney smok driven hence we view, Shall not divine displeasure sweep away From off the earth thoses warmes that dimne our day? Shall publick Prayer, and the secret moan Of Saints, unanswer'd ly at Justice Throne? To you the times is given to understand; Shew, if fit times do call, hand join'd in hand That all for God, true valour to improve, With Echoes of joint acclamations, move, Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your Swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme; the Battell is the Lord's. For the States of Parliament. God's worthies, in whose hand the Helme to guide The Muse's freedome with the Estates of Parliament. Of Government is given, set far a-side Your private Intrests. Not to make you great, Proud, Powerfull, or Rich, the Trust of State On you conferr'd is: for the Publike Good, Not Goods, your actings would be understood. On you are many eyes. Eyes, from above, Below, within, without, pry how ye move, How equally ye walk. But here I'le hold, Their pardon humbly pleaded. And begs your pardon, if I haue been bold. Now, when our rent Republick's Ship is tost, With growing stormes; when things of greatest cost And highest value, by this Isle enjoy'd, Endanger'd are. Our Soveraigne's life destroy'd, Our Soveraigne's dearest life; his Royall blood, (To usher in a shamefull servitude) Pour'd forth; His Scepters to posterity, Decern'd a Trophee of proud Tyranny; These Kingdomes' Heir exild (our Soveraign Lord) And almost all the Issue, at a word To be led forth to death (a sacrifice, In smoake whereof their glory to arise Unto its highest point, as safest mean By them, for their securitie foreseen,) What pawse ye? Whence proceeds this silence deep? Silence not sutable to a time of so evident danger to Church and State, waiting only in the full ripenesse and fit opportunity, for execution. Your enemies (beleev't) are not a-sleep. Shall men so desperately wicked hold Their hand, the Father of three Nations, bold To put to death, and not with jealous eye Look on the Children, tyed to aske them why? Where your Antcestors' ready hands and hearts? The Gallantry of our Noble Antcestors propos'd for encouragement to resolution. Associates look ye for, from forraigne parts As troubled at our stroake, and by our wound Of Christian Kings the veynes all opened found? Or, dare not Judah war with Edom wage, The history of K. Amaziah 2 Chr. 25. for application. Till Ephraim, not at one with God, engadge, Till Israel Arme; which, ordered to depart, (By this conjunction, Amaziah's heart Made haughty, and lift'd up,) turnd discontent, And Judah's Cities spoiling, as they went, Shed blood at will, and did no outrage spare That (now-a-dayes) the basest villaines dare. But what? These gone, did Edom gaine the day? Was Judah's King delivered as a prey, For want of pow'r? No. Hee who stay'd the Sun On Gibeon; and in Ajalon the Moone, Till on his foes aveng'd; by Judah's hand A victory most glorious did command For Judah's host. But grief doth heer arest My trembling hand, appal'd to write the rest. To Edom's idols didst thou turn aside Wretch'd Judah, while their spoiles thou didst divide? O yes; from Truth, there, shamefully thou fell, And justly turn'd thy back to Israel, Which, made thy Rod, thy ruine quickly wrought, Thy King to Perish, by the People, brought. God, only wise, your heart with Counsell fill, That, quitting of your selves like men of skill, Fast what ye have ye hold, lest all cast down Built heer-to-fore, ye lose a glorious Crown. But leaving all on Him, in more and lesse, All ranks heartned to concurrence by the nearest Tyes of duty to God, King, and Country. Whose eye must guide you. Now, our King's distresse, The cry of blood, shed by a murthering hand, The infamy of a despised Land, The fowlest of affronts; Call, yea conjure All ranks, by all the Tyes, known to secure Religion, publike Interests, private Rights, 'Gainst open force, and undermining slights; If Piety, Compassion; if the sense Of deepest wrong, haue weight or influence On loyall Scottish hearts, in sight of Heaven Your just resentment and offence made eaven, As instruments of God joine heart and hand To raise the Glory of this slighted Land, Men calling to account, by whom is shed The blood, that brethren hath unbrothered. The Taske in hand, suppone the hazard great, The carrying on of the work put over-confidently on God, from proof of past mercies and former experiences of power and good will to His people. Yet neither case, nor cure are desperate. Faith to improve, the Oath of God you tyes, Whose proof of Mercies mercy yet implyes Unto Beleevers, fears who dare out-face, And footsteps of preceeding paths can trace. Your wayes on him devolve (sure) he will do, To fight who taught your fingers hitherto. Frogs, Flyes, Dry bones, Hee, ere ye Armies want, Shall for you Arme, the Arme of flesh to daunt. Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. For the Commanders in chief and faithfull Souldiery. Ye, Men of Valour, honorably bred At armes; whose Glory, deeply Registred, Stands to succeeding Times, as men of Trust, Integrity, and tendernes, in Just Defence of Truth, King, Country, Covenant, The calling of our deserving Commanders, Officers in chief and Souldiery evidenced, from proof of constant faithfulnesse in the Cause of God, as reserved for the ensueing work. God calls anew. Behold, he will not want Your Testimony. Never grounds more clear For Noble action, did then now appear. Have guarded been your hearts, your hands kept clean In Scotland's late Eclipse? How clear is seen In this God's speciall hand? While not the least From their witnessing against the unlawfull engagement choosing rather to be without charge, then to charge their consciences with a sinful compliance. In quality and number, were possest Of a Malignant Spirit, did ye stand Free of Compliance, Order, or Command Destructive to his Cause, and closely kept At your first Principles? The hand that heapt Upon them shame did fixe you in your spheare, That yet his Standart ye on high might reare. How calme a Peace, what quietnesse of minde Their peace of minde arising from the sense of mercie, supported against the power of temptations from the Isle of Wight and preservd from acting at Mauchlin-mure, the prelude of an unlucky Tragedy. I ask, enjoy ye (if a tongue can finde Words sutable) whom frown, nor favour's smile, Nor Hopes, nor Honours, from the fatall Isle Whence were reviv'd our woes, (Preferment, Place, And Pension proof) enduc't not, charge t' embrace Saints' blood to shed; while (witnesse to their zeal) To some, death sign'd a passe; and some a seal Bare hence, best suteing base Malignancy; Men, whom unsound diseased Times did try. But heark! a voice, past whispring in the ear, Their concession to the late King's removall from Newcastle objected and answered. Calls for your vindication, how ye clear Your Rendring in the powre of Armed bands Your Rendred Prince, while pow'r was in your hands. But, (as profest, protested, and declard, 1. As proceeding from Trust to these manifold professions, protestations, declarations, yea engagement of the publike faith of the Kingdom in order to a safe, free and honourable Treaty between the King and Parliament. 2. From the foreseen danger to the Work of Reformation and breach of the peace of the Kingdoms through his Ma, supposed purpose of addresse to Scotland, being firme in judgment and profestly standing for grounds solemnly abjured by Us and destructive of the Covenant. Yea publick faith empaund,) who have not heard How, not a shew pretended of intent, Save (for a Treaty with the Parliament) To serve his Royall Person for a guard, Yet, of base acts they not the basest spar'd Could serve their ends? And, what the Consequence Had (heer) produc't, (if by your conduct hence He should haue hither turn'd, while broiles and blood, (Effects of factions and of tumults rude) The Land did fill, who lay aright to heart? Yea, while his resolution not to part With principles (exprest, by him, a Tye Which Life and Crownes engadg't,) for Prelacy And book of Pray'r, so solemnly abjur'd: While this His minde his Majestie assur'd, Who could haue (heer) comply'd? Who, saue these men (Our Peace-disturbers) should haue said Amen? How (both within, and from without, renu'd) Had not a bloody dispute thence ensu'd? Us, Conscience of our League keept firme. If they Prevaricating, wickedly did stray From Honour, Duty, Faith, then grounds how Just Thus offer, how this doubt may be discust? The ignoble carriage of those perfidious Impostors (betrayers of trust) a just motive for men of honour so fowly faild to, to call to account the Authors and complices of this impudent Treachery. How best your candour and ingenuous way May as the Sun appear at the Noon-day, Endeavouring (in due time) to Right a wrong, Which heavens, though men should passe, shall judge ere long. A broken Covenant, base perjury, All degrees sensible of God's and the Kingdom's dishonour called to joine with the King (owning the Cause and Covenant) in charging home upon wicked Covenant-breakers this inexpiable injury. All with their sin who stick not to comply, Call to make ready, and for God to rise, For King and Country, lookt on as a prise By men of bloods. Thus shall fowl mouths be closde Your streight proceedings to reproach disposde, Thus Scotland's glory grow, and thus made known That Gedeon's hundreds heer, our God will own, Lead forth, and fit, when he the word shall give For him to Act; dead hearts who can revive, Even prompt your hands and Spirits for these ends On which the Generall Happinesse depends, The Prince and People acting (one in heart In Will and Counsell) each, a gallant part, Engadg'd in God; on which condition closde Our Noble undertakings are supposde, That all obstructions from the way remov'd By Uniforme consent may be approv'd. Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. For the People and Commonalty. God's precious people, Commons of the Land, The people owning their interest in the promises, by reason of Christ's donation with the Isles and ends of the earth, Psal. 2, the prime motive of their entring in Covenant and acting for Christ. Religion's forward friends with Life in hand, For Christ who have adventred, meerly driven By reason of his Right and Title given To earth's remotest ends; by whom enclinde This Generation, seriously did minde Their Intrest in the Promises to owne, By Gospell Light made to Beleevers known, Held forth unto the Church; from whence to heart Was lay'd, (in speciall duty on our part) For Christ, King, Country, into Covenant To enter, and rich successe ne'er did want While honestly, in Men and Angels' view We jointly moving, did joint ends pursue. And now, while after so much blood's expense, The work of Reformation being far advanced, and great difficulty overcome, GOD hath permitted men, for our sins, yet for a season, to obstruct the way. Cost, Paines, and prayers (in our Just Defence) Our hopes were far advanc'd, Behold, the way Obstructed is anew. Ludibrious Clay Dare craule on borrowed leggs, and Heaven defy, The Son of God take on its top, and try His work to overturne, Himself dethrone, And, in the hand of his Anointed One, The Scepter break. What honest heart not bleeds, What spirit's not on edge, at these misdeeds, These unexampled Acts, that dim the glory To these, and after-times, of Christian story? But face they hitherward in Arms? what then? God's people encouraged upon Solide grounds to stand to their duty. Choose slaves to darknesse, servants unto men, To yeeld yourselves or venter? Yet a day Doth Christ (heer) call for, on His Royall way Of noble conquest, can it sute your minde, Your spirits, by a Covenant refin'd, Not to attend His Orders, who in vaine You kept not hitherto, that ye remaine Till now unvanquish'd? set before your eyes What, even what not, at stake in hazard lyes, And, gath'ring from past practise, how have been All your attempts for Christ successefull seen, Set foreward stoutly, in his strength stand to it, Not bow nor shield, the Lord's Right Hand must do it, Who, if our King He Instrumentall make, The King's owning the work (when stirred up for that end by the Lord) to be held for a token of good. As Orderer of the Play, the stage to take (In answer to our earn'st desires), by all, Be held a presage most auspicious shall, For which we pray, yea hope; that grounds to none Occur, of controversie 'gainst the Throne; As of his Diadems the Royall Right He would establish (in his foes' despight) To Christ committed, every way beside God's way disclaim'd; As on His part to side, Engage he would the pow'rs of Earth and Heaven, And, by His Order, may (for word) be given: Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. For the KING. Great Prince, whose honour doth the honour staine The King honoured by God above other Kings as having committed to him the Scepter of Government over lands gifted to Christ in speciall manner. Of greatest Princes, Righteous Soveraigne, The Scepter over Kingdoms set to swey, That gifted are to Christ in speciall way, Where, while He Lawes for Government doth give, And takes the Throne, hath mad't Thy lot to live. Three Crowns of Him thou hold'st, by long descent, The improving of just power for the advantage of Christ's Interests, the surest pillar for supporting of the Kings Thrones. These, for advantage of the just extent Of His prerogative, so Thou improve, Thy throne's-establishments best mean shall prove. Him to acknowledge Heavens thy heart incline, Christ to be acknowledged in His Royall Prerogative, and to be made use of in all his Offices, as one by whom Kings reign, Prov. 8. 15; and who removeth and setteth up Kings, Dan. 2. 21, at his pleasure. In all His Offices; thy duties line That not transgressing, as ingag'd, He may Imploy for thee His pow'r, May in the day Of danger make thy peace, and wisedome give, Thy people's dying heart's how to revive, For bow before Him, as the meanest, must The Most, and Mightiest of created dust. His Three-fold Scepter can no Rule admit, Regall Power and Authority consistent with the absolutenesse of Christ's Soveraignty. But such as doth his absolutenesse fit Of Soveraignty, which most consistent stands With Regall pow'r, by Him put in thy hands, For, who Himself the Lord Jehovah shew, Hath said, to Cæsar give what's Cæsar's due. Learn to submit, to Him betimes to flee, The King's heart a fit blank to put in Christ's hand to fill up, and in proof of the reality of the offer the signing of the Covenant, in securing of Religion, necessary. That lifted up by Him thy head may be; A blank put in His Hand; upon thy heart The heads that He may fill, for either part, Of an eternall League; In which to deal Ingenuously that thou intends, the Seal Set to the holy Band, (A priviledge To every King not Common) for a pledge Of faith ingag'd shall serve, and clear thy way Of great obstructions, in thy Rising day. Far, far be from thee, as thy judgement's stroke, To walk in the counsell of the wicked, and joine in the yock of bad association, to be guarded against by the King, in his tender years, as against a sure stroak of judgement. To join thy shoulder in unequall yoke Of bad associations, or to call Unto thy counsell men of Beliall, Who, in thy tender bosome, to infuse The poyson of bad principles will chuse. Grief fills our hearts so soon to see thy reigne; Scotland's grief and Scotland's joy. Yet joy we ever, Sacred Soveraigne, That from thy Father's loines, who Rul'd of late, Succeedeth One to fill the Chaire of State, From Race to Race, all whose Dominions may Thy just commands most loyally obey. Spare, Spare (we pray) to give thy Scotland ground, The prejudice of intertained jealousies between the King and his Subjects. More deep and deadly, that may make her wound By harboring, in a jealous heart, mistakes, Of which the thought the very ground-work shakes Of mutuall confidence. O daign to hear Their just desires, with thee who burden bear, To stand and fall, to live and dy with thee In God, whose bands Inviolable be. Thy judgment Heavens informe, and clear what tye On Christian Subjects doth convincing lye, Attempts to owne, for which those men do move, Who most unjustly thy just pow'r improve, And pleading for all crimes commission, staine The tender honour of a Soveraigne, As tyrant turn'd. We humbly do deny, The duty of loyall Subjects as relating to Christ's absolute Soveraignty. These practises may passe for loyalty To God, and thee in Him, our duties bound To Soveraignty supreme relating found, So that on us restraining bonds are laid, Till surety of Religion be made, Till Solemn League and Covenant be own'd By Thee, for Christ, in Truth's defence, enthron'd, To which, while in suspense of thy consent, Our hands are feeble, and our spirits faint. These minding come, and put in exercise Thy Regall pow'r; of all Thine enemies The necks be given Thee, to be trampled on, Religion, Government, Christ's and Thy Throne Who dare oppose. O that thou may'st lay hold And fasten grips upon these locks of Gold Found on Time's fore-head, and from events learn Of ling'ring Resolutions to discern Sad successes. Thus Heaven Thy counsels blesse, And make Thy Throne a Throne of Righteousnesse. As Monarch of thy Subjects' hearts, for Thee Thus many to the Throne of Grace shall flee, And plead Thy cause, for whose just interests, all Shall cordially cry, when God doth call, Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. Grounds of Hope for Beleevers. But smiles the Sectary? how with disdain Heard is the freedom of the Muse's strain? Us adversaries brave on either hand, Dangers and difficulties arising on all hands, grounds of Confidence offered from the Word of truth in the subsequent propositions. These, on successefull fate's smooth conduct stand. Grown desperate are others, whose disgrace Through failings of attempts, leaves shame of face. Both at advantage ly. Shall this breed fear? When-and-wheresoever the Mistery of Christ is broken up, and Reformation advanced, then and there shall the Church the ruine of many enemies, Zech. 13. 1, 2, 3, &amp;??. compared with, Zech. 12. 3; Revel. 3. 10. No: We a Chiftain follow who shall clear Our way, and (in this sad temptation's houre, On travell, in the greatnesse of his pow'r, As gifted with Earth's ends and Isles, where we, Rul'd by His Scepter, live) shall the decree A people solemnly owned by God before the world, and sought out by his standart, need not fear their fals brethren when God begins to appear, in strength and fury, like himself against them, Isa. 62. 10, 11, 12, compared with Isa. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4. Past in his favours earst (even Ours, by right Of promise) see, for us fulfil'd, in spight Of opposition, on his word who rest, Whose times, and wayes of working are the best. How-ever (often) persecuting foes Saints' blood have shed, yet (while this tempest blows) When Antichrist shall be fully revealed the Lord shall consume him, 2 Thess. 2. 7, 8. Who not discerne (unto its greatest hight The throne of Antichrist attain'd, the light Of many Gospel Truths begun to shine) When Christ takes armes for his Church, although the enemy should overflow, he shall lift up his Standard in Vengeance against him, Isaiah 59. 17, 18, 19; Psal. 18. That, drest in Armes for warfare (to refine His Gold, and purge away the object Ore) Christ is marchd forth (flames ushering him before) In bloody Garments, through destruction dyde Of Truth's opposers, who shall prosperous ryde Christ having risen, after long silence and suffering, will so much the more be active against his enemies, Isa. 42. 13, 14. In Triumph, minding (hence) an active way Before as silent, in his suffering day? For (meerly) Civill things did we contend (As, in this case, Lands a Religious end Professing, (nothing so), deserv'dly, have Been trampled on,) us might our hopes deceive. But formally for Christ, in termes direct We for his title stand, (all due respect Had to our Soveraigne's intrests, in the right Of all his Crownes). Will Christ his quarrell slight, Whoever assay to make void Christ's establisht Yoke Them shall Christ vexe, Psal. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Not vindicate His Honour? not maintain The setled Order of his house, in vain Els heer (alone) establisht by his hand Where God hath a vineyard of red wine settled, he will keep it lest any hurt it, Isa. 27. 2, 3. At such expense of Means, throughout the Land, Yea of his People's blood, dear in his sight? Which Order (hitherto) gainst hellish slight What God hath done at the expense of his Saints blood, he will not easily forgoe, Psal. 116. 13. And brutish force, so tendered Providence, That, not one dyat of his Church, hath (thence) Been mar'd from meeting; neither any part If they have not gained ground, they shall not gaine ground, Psal. 129. 2, 5.

The choice place, where to dwell he doth encline, In beauty where his Ordinances shine, Will he not care for, cover with his wing, And guard against those men, a meaner thing Bloody Covenant breakers, having had great successe, shall not live long, Ps. 55. 19, 20, 23. Who counted have the Oath of God, and past So lightly, from proud necks, his yoke to cast? Will he, aveng'd who violated faith Profaners of the oath of God shall not prosper or escape, Ezek. 17. 15, 18, 19, evident in Uladislaus K. of Hungarie beaten at Varna by Amurath the 6. In heathen's favours, on his People hath, In favours of his People, from on high, Let passe unplagued heathnish perfidie? While some designe, Christ next a King to place; Or (thus disguisde) are found upon the chace Of self-advantages, a cloake to draw Of zeal, of duety of supremest Law. Yea, while with Christ, deny'd to raigne alone, Their Dagon Others, his divided Throne To share do offer, and with Christ to dwell Christ purposeth to hold house where he purgeth the Sons of Levi, and there to come neare to judgement for his people, Mal. 3. 1-3, 4, 5. Have priviledged all the powers of hell. Is Christ his house of purging at the paines, And planting men, by whom his Kingdome gaines, It is a Gospel-and-peaceable time, and a Token for good to his people when God sends forth faithfull and honest Ministers, Jer. 3. 15, 18. (A Ministrie according to his heart) That bloody hands the Gospel spoiles should part? When the barren is made the mother of many children, and gets God for her husband, there is large peace and priviledges promist, Isa. 54. 1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 17. Or hath our Lord a tender brood begot Of children heer, his weaklings to devote To bloody hands, his youth; whose chiefest thing Desirable, is to detaine the King; Yea, while on life and death resolv'd they have While a people do cleave to God, he is engadged to own them and do for them, 2 Chron. 15. 2. Close to his Truth and Covenant to cleave? In mouths of all the Prophets, whence arise God would reveal it to his Servants if he purposed to destroy, who in this case would not promise good, Amos 3. 7. Our joyes of successe, speaks the Sprite of lyes? Or shall the Saints, to whom he doth declare His counsell, (friends, who on his secrets are) Christian walkers with God would not be altogether strangers to God's purpose, if he intended to destroy, Joh. 15. 15; Psal. 25. 14. With what he doth acquainted, in this case, (This case alone) for hopes have shame of face? Brought low (indeed deserv'dly) we have been, The hope of his people shall not make them ashamed haveing to do with transgressours without a cause. And yet may low be laid, that every mean In which we might conceat, abasde may be, Even all our Glorie's pride staind we may see. When God's people are laid low, he must recover them, Deut. 32. 36. But when in us all strength is spent and gone, The work which the Lord hath begun and far prosecute, he will perfect, Deut. 3. 2, 4. Turne and Repent him shall that Holy One; He, all whose wayes his searchlesse wisdome sute, The rods of his people tending to bring them under the bond of the Covenant will be the ruine of rebells, Ezek. 20. 37, 38. And for his Works perfection contribute Shall purge the Land, and Rebels' plots supplant, Unmindfull never of his Covenant: God will alway minde his Covenant, while his people stick by it, Psal. 111. 5. Els with that Throne of sin should Christ partake For framing mischief, which a Law doth make. The Throne of iniquitie set up without God and maintained without him decreeing mischief against God &amp; Godlinesse shall not have standing before him, Psal. 94. 20, 21. May never dawne to us that horrid day, (Day of rebuke and blasphemy,) on way While brought the Child is to the place of birth, That from the womb strength faileth to bring forth. When the child is come to the birth, and all done to a little, it were a day of blasphemie if it were not brought forth, 2 Kings 19. 3, compared with Isa. 66. 9. For say, all means should fail, how great our shame To doubt that Christ shall magnifie His Name. How ever heer iniquitie abound, Yea sin on foot, to fill the Land be found, Though sin do abound God will not forsake his people, yea the holy seed shall be the substance of the land, Jer. 51. 5; Isa. 6. 13. Yet he, his People who doth not foresake, The Holy Seed shall for its substance take, And with his vine (provockt) if he debate, If God smite a growing vine he must debate with it in measure suteable to its being and wellbeing, Isa. 27. 3, 6, 7, 8. The stroake in measure he shall moderate. Then shew we faces, foes let us defy, While Jesus Christ his Standard rears on high. Fall may who ripe are to receive the Crown, Or rotten branches, fit for hewing down, But fall who will, the Cause shall never fall, While stick to him a seed, a Remnant shall. For he, who comes in judgement, Lands to sift, When God comes near to Judgement against sorcerers, then will he swiftly judge false swearers, Mal. 3. 5. Against the sorcerers, a witnesse swift, Shall, cloath'd with vengeance, poure contempt and shame Upon false-swearers, by His Holy Name. Then Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your Swords. Arme, Gallants, arme. The Battell is the Lord's. Grounds of Comfort and Encouragement for the Secret Mourners of England (and els where) resolving stedfastnes in the Covenant. But tym'st Thou, with deep sighs, thy Song? do tears The lands cald to mourning and humiliation in day of the Lord's deep displeasure, Ezek. 9. Their fountaines force, and Muse, while Britaine hears No language but Alarmes, no milder sounds Then of engadgements, Tumults, Death and Wounds? Weep, justly weep. Tears sute the season. This, A day, in which God calls for mourning, is, A gloomy day, in which the Childe of Light Of our darkness, Isa. 50. 10. Sitt's in the shads of darknes, short of sight. The day of Joseph's straits; of deep distresse Of Joseph's affliction and Sion's tryall in England and Ireland, under pressure of sectarian power. To many a precious soul, chaisde (for redresse) To him who's Mighty, on whom help is layd, His suffring Members, by his Arme to ayd, (His Arme, that earst proud Rahab, and the snaike Amos 6. 6; Heb. 6. 18; Psal. 90. 19. In peeces cut, and way through waves did make) That yet made bare, it may awake, to wound The Dragon's Seed, from principles unsound The lively delineation of whose tenets and course (drawn by the Holy Ghost) may be seen in the 2 of the 2 Epistle of Peter and in the Epistle of Jud. Which poison spreading and dispersing snares The simpler to surprise, by fraud or fears Unstable souls seduce; from whence (the way Of Truth blasphem'd) are vexd, from day to day, The souls of Saints; while men, who mischief frame, Like raging waves, foame forth their filth and shame. The Publick foe be These, O England, These These the publick enemy of England, and the rod upon the lot of the Righteous, there. Shall Tasks enjoyne, and straiten (as they please) The cords of thy Captivity, at best The rods are, on the Righteous lot that rest. These the covert enemy of Scotland, lying at advantage against the Lord's Inheritance, here. How-ever bound in Conscience to resent Their practises, whence doth arise our Rent, To you, for War, do not our Trumpets sound. No message but of peace to Christ's suffering members there. No. Your sad posture doth our Spirits wound, In order unto which resolv'd we have Unanimity and Brotherly association to be intertained with them in order to the League &amp; Covenant, and prosecution of the ends thereof. With you, and for you, to our League to cleave, With Charity to All, who pure and clean To keep their Garments, upon guard have been, And waiting are, God's Way and Time to take, The Yock of bondage from thrald necks to shake That both here and there, God may be feared and the King honoured, 1 Pet. 2. 17. That, (as sweet fruits from these effects) may spring The Fear of God, and Honour of the King. Awake to duties then; your eyes be fixd In pursuence of these ends, England (in God's oppor tunity) upon clear grounds encouraged to duties. Upon these ends. Become shall Ephraim (mix'd Among the People) like an unturn'd Cake, Or heartlesse Dove, discourag'd, faint, and weak? God (doubtlesse) for himself, airl'd (earst) in Thee 1. As a Land long ago arled and owned by Christ, so many faithfull Martyres haveing layed down their lives for him there. A Church O England, set from darknesse free, While at the stake, thy faithfull Martyrs stood A good Confession, sealing with their blood. Yea, God the Bargan (yet again) renewd 2. As a Land which hath revived the Bargan afresh with Christ, having sworn his Covenant and sealed it with so many lives, sacrificed for it, there. God hath in wisedom made the enemy in that land be seen in their Colours, hath gathered together with arms in their hands, and permitted to stur (as he hath set the bounds) for manifesting his own Glory in his Churche's Deliverance, by their more speedy overthrow, and the fuller execution of fury upon them. When that espoused Land, with love pursud, His Covenant did swear, and at low rate Did value lives, that Jesus might be great. Lo! God hath wisely, and to purpose, brought His foes together arm'd, for Armes who sought, And let them out a link, that stir they may, Yet so as no where, but as He gives way, Thus shall He in one houre, or day, decide What else some ages dispute might abide. Wait on ye then, whose weight is Sion's case; God to be waited upon as One who shall surely gather, and rejoyce the sad hearts of the scattered Remnants of that land, and else where, to whom the reproach of his house is a burden, Zeph. 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Wait on that Holy One who hides his face From Jacob's house; sure, He you gather shall, And tenderly deal with his remnants small. For our correction, and their overthrow However God hath established there, for a season a prevailing enemy, for Judgement, (even the ruine of that Malignant party that first took the sword against him) as also for our correction, Hab. 1. 12. Yet shall the vision speak and be heard in its apointed time, Ibid. 2. 3. Who 'gainst him first ingadg'd, hath God this foe Rais'd up, but heard shall in its season be The vision. Issu'd forth is the decree. But friends their fit time, foes their fatall houre, It's time God's Glory (from His acts of pow'r) Their times, yea promises conditionall Have for accomplishment. The work withall Freinds, enemies, the work, God's glory, as also conditionall promises (as Levit. 26. 41; 1 Kings 8. 38) haveing all their apointed times of advantage, disadvantage, advancement, manifestation and accomplishment, till the times of all the forsaids meet, none may judge or complaine of God's delayes. Its time of best advantage hath. Assign'd To each the proper time is. Till we finde All in one point to meet, none may complain, Nor of delayes a jealous thought retain. Let this suffice, your times are in his hand, Who from the fire can pluck a kindled brand, And like a mighty man, rous'd up from sleep, Shall help right early, and the best time keep. His Reck'ning from Eternity he laid, It may suffice, that in his hands are the times of his elect, Psal. 31. 15; who keeps the best time, and will help right airly, Psal. 46. 5. And times, and wayes, and means harmonious made To bring to passe His Ends; and did foresee Delayes, which arbitrary were and free, To his deep wisdome, gainfull. So though (now) Ye know not what he doth, ere-long to you His face he shall unvail. Then make no hast, Yee who by faith, on promises can feast, But patience shew, till God shall give the word, Which Heaven and Earth to publish shall accord. Let Colours fly, Drums beat. Gird on your Swords. Arme, Gallants, Arme. The Battell is the Lord's. Close. But duties to enforce, sith words are weak, And grounds of hops, men's confidence to take, Till God put to his hand; Great King of Saints, In whom for Thine nor pow'r nor wisdom wants, On Thee alone is left, That light divine May by the Spirit to our Watch-men shine, Keept free and faithfull, Taught the times to know, By them, that Counsell (seasonably) may flow. May all our Rulers, singly seek the ends, Proposd in Covenant with Thee; what tends To Truth's advantage (in their heart acquaint With Christ), to prosecute be their intent, That (self-deny'd) all grounds of jealousies May perish, (private ends far from their eyes) And shoulders joining, unto duties prone, The work may equally be caried on. Be Souldiers like the Cause, and Spirit given By God, unto their undertakings eaven. Profannesse and oppression both be far From all engadging in this Holy War. Know may aright all Ranks the quarrel's spring, Before him, in their Spirits floorishing, Not shrinking at supplyes, while all is layd, And in decision, as the game is playd. May light break in upon our Soveraigne's soul All Counsell, not for good, that may controul, To lead him in this Maze, discovering snares, That grounds are of his danger, of our fears. That joine he may, in heart, for God, and glad The Land, our blessing, and our glory made. Foes be reclaim'd, for whom is purposd good, Who Peace lay hold on purchased by blood, But perish all, who principled from hell, Hold on their way and proudly means repell. O let thy people's hearts, (confirmd in faith Of much good-will) rest chearfull underneath Thy exercising hand, in confidence Pursuing duties, that due glory thence To Thee may rise, to whom all knees shall bow, And wait with praises to perform the Vow. Finis. Some Psalmes translated and presented for a proof to publick view, wherby to discerne of the whole being conformed to this essay. By A Weilwiller to the work of Reformatioun, who makes humble offer of his weak endeavours. Verse numbers of psalms appear as sidenotes. To all the sinceare seekers of the Lord, and in him spirituall furniture from the liuelie fountaines of his holy word. Let not seeme strange that (heere) no studied phrase Charme thy conceat, and itching eare amaize. Simplicitie of words, stile grave, posd, plaine, The Spirit (doubtles) did no chuise in vaine. Pure streams, from purest fountaines, to present, In David's language, David's minde to vent My purpose is. Thogh for this task but able, As we a liveing face sie on a table In charcoale draughts: or, as a body true, The eye taks vp, when but its shade wee view, Yett, for this chairge, (in strength how e're wneavin), As God hath furnischt, I againe have givin, Where, so thow lyff and pow'r from him perceaue, Both for thy good and mine, my end I haue. For, if I can, whiles I with Dauid sing, To Dauid's harp, my hart in consort bring, And profite thee, so God the glorie gett, To my weak ayme, no end beside is sett. I. 1 The man is blessed verilie Who walketh not astray In counsell of vngodlie men, Nor stands in sinners' way, 2 Nor sitts in scorners' seat, but setts On God's law his delight, And stedfastlie his law doth minde And muse on, day and night. 3 Hee shall be like vnto the tree Sett by the river side, In seasoun due which fruit brings foorth, Whose leaves ay blooming bide.4 His workes shall prosper all; not so Vngodlie men, for they Shall be like chaffe, which stormie wynds Sweep suddenlie away. 5 In judgment therfore shall not stand Men wicked and profane, Nor sinners, where the righteous flock Assembled do remaine.6 For, who so righteous paths persue, The Lord doth know their way; But perrish shall the way of sin, Wherin the wicked stray. II. 1 Why rage the heathen? Why to thoughts So vaine, give people place? 2 Earth's kings and rulers ryse, resolv'd Rebellioun to embrace, Against the Lord, against his Christ; Consulting thus they say: 3 Ther bands lett ws asunder break, Ther cords cast quite away. 4 Butt hee whose seat is heaven sall laugh, The Lord sall them deride,5 And in his indignation just, Against them then proceid. Yea tell them, while hee troubles sore, (Incensd) doeth on them bring,6 I on my Sion's holy hill, Anointed have my King. 7 I, Thee decree will intimate; The Lord hath said to me, My sonne belov'd thow art, to day I have begottin thee.8 Ask, and for ane enheritance, The heathen sall be thyne; For a possessioun, vnto thee Earth's ends I will assigne. 9 A rod of iron them to breake, For scepter shalt thow swey. Them all to peeces shalt thow dash, Like potter's brittle clay.10 Kings therfor now be wise; O learne ?ee, who earth's judges sitt;11 Serve God with fear, amidst your joyes A reverent aw admitt. 12 O kisse the sonne, lest in his wraith Yee perrisch from the way. Iff once his furie flame, who trust In him how happy they. III.2 Sam. 15. 14-16. Thus Dauid sung, in straits, when hee From Absolon his sonne, did flie. 1 O Lord how ar my foes encreast? Against me manie ryse.2 How manie of my soule doe say, (Thy pow're who dare despise)3 No help's for him in God, but thow, My sheeld in tyme of neid, My glory art. When languisching, Thow (Lord) liftst vp my head. 4 I with my voyce did seek the Lord, Hee from his holy hill5 Did ansuer mak. I laid me doun; Sleep all my fears did still.6 I wak'd againe, for me the Lord Sustainde. Ten thousand laid Of people, raging me around, Mee cannot mak affreyde. 7 Arise, O Lord, me save my God, For thow hast foild my foes, And on the cheikbone smiten all, That wp against me rose.8 Thow brocken hast the wicked's teeth. Salvation doeth alone To thee belong. Thy blessing, Lord, Thy people is vpon. IV. 1 God of my righteousnes, to thee When I my suit doe send, Doe not withdraw thyne eare from me, Bot to my cry attend. When in distresse, perplex'd I pind, Thow didst enlarge me (Lord); O lett me now thy favour find, To my requeist accord. 2 Why stryve yee still (men's sonns) to staine My glory with disgrace? How long will yee (in what is vaine Delighting) lyes embrace?3 Know for him selff the Lord hath sett The Godlie man apart. I certainlie will hearing gett, When I my sins impart. 4 Submitt and tremble, goe not on To sin, in anie case; Talk with your hearts apart, vpon Yo? beds, and be at peace.5 The sacrifice of righteousnes Lett your oblation be, And place your trust w? stedfastnes On God allennerly. 6 Whence anie good (by many thus Is murmured) shall wee have? Lord lift thow vp thy light on ws, Thy countenance wee crave.7 My heart more cheirfull hast thow made, Then when of corne and wyne A plenteous increase them maks glad; Thair joy is not lyk mine. 8 In peace I'le both ly doun and sleep, For thow, thow only (Lord), For me to duell midst dangers deep, In saiftie dost afford. V. 1 Heare, Lord, my words, O let have weght My worke of discowrse, heart w? thee,2 My voice's cry, my King and God, Acceptable let be.3 For thee implore I will. My voice Lord thow shalt ayrely hear. Ile order ayrly my request, And looking wp appear. 4 For not a God that taks delight In wickednes thow art,5 With thee no evill duells; the fooll Sall from thy face depairt.6 All workers of iniquitie Thow hatst; the Lyar (Lord) Thow wilt cutt off; by thee ar false And bloodie men abhorrd. 7 Bot as for me, whom thow hast made Thy mercies manifold By frequent prooff pertake, the way Vnto thyne house Ile hold; The temple of thy holinesse My worschip shall respect, Which in thy feare accomplishing I thither shall direct. 8 Becaus of my observers lead Me in thy righteousnes,9 O Lord; to me, thy pathes mak plaine; For found no faithfullnes Is in ther mouthes; within them lurks All wickednes &amp; wrong: Ther throats ane open sepulcher, They flatter with ther tong. 10 Destroy thow them, O God; them caus By ther owne counsells fall, For ther transgressiouns multiply'd Them bring to ruine all; For they against thee stubburnely Rebellion have embrac'd.11 But lett all them rejoyce, in thee Whose confidence is plac'd. Shout may they still for joy, becaus Protect'd they are by thee;12 All them that love thy name, O Lord, In thee lett joyfull be. For on the righteous man, O Lord, Thy blessing doth abide; Him shall thy favour as a sheild Secure on every side. VI. 1 Me to rebuik forbeare, O Lord, Whill kendled is thine ire, Nor chasten me whill flameing is Thy wraith's consumeing fire. 2On me compassion take, O Lord, For voyd of strenth am I. Heal me, O Lord, for in my bons Sore troubled do I fry 3 Sore troubles vexe my weghted soule, Bot thow, how long, O Lord?4 Turne, Lord; O turne, wnto my soule At length releiff afford.5 O save me for thy mercies sake, For none, in death, ther bee Thee to remember. In the grave Who sall give thanks to thee? 6 With groaneing weary groune, all night To suime I make my bed; My couch I water w? my tears, In great abundance shed.7 By reasoun of excessive greiff Consumed is my sight; And waxeth old because of all Mine enemyes' despight. 8 Ye workers of iniquitie From me do all depart;9 For, of my mournefull groanes, the voyce The Lord hath laid to heart.10 The Lord my prayer hath receav'd, Who to my suite gave eare; Sore vexd and (blushing), all my foes With sudden shame releaue. VII. Concerning Cush the Benjamite, His words thus David did endyte. 1 Lord, thow my God art, great in might, I put my trust in thee; Opprest and persecute by spight, Save and deliuer me.2 Save, lest my trembling soule the foe Doe lyk a lion, teare, And rent without releeff, whill no Deliu'rer doth appear. 3 If guiltie, Lord my God, I be Of this; if in my hands Be wickednesse; of amitie Iff I have brock the bands,4 Rewarding evill to my freends; Yee, have not him rescued, Who (causlesse) did my hurt intend, My soule let be persewed. 5 Of it my partie lett mak prey, Yea, lett him (as wer just) My lyff on earth tread doun, and lay My honour in the dust.6 Rise, Lord, enraig'd; thy throne O take, My foes ar furious growne. To thy appointed judgment wake, For me thy might mak known. 7 So throngs of people sall enclose And glaidlie compasse thee. Vp therfor, Lord, becaus of those, Returne thow vpon high. 8The Lord the people, more and lesse, Sall judge; Lord, judge thow me According to my righteousnes And my integrity. 9 The malice of the wicked bound, O bring it to ane end! But stable lett the just be found By search; thow dost discend10 Into the heart and reins, just Lord; God is a scheeld to me; To all hee saiftie doth afford, In hart who vpright be. 11 God judgeth just men; bot abhor'd Of God, is every day12 The wicked. Hee will whet his sword Vnlesse hee change his way. His bow is bent and readie made,13 For him death's weapons gott; Prepar'd his arrowes, to invade The persecuters hott. 14 Behold hee travelleth with payne, To hatch iniquity, And (great with mischeeff), vexd in vayn, Brings forth at last a lie.15 A pitt he (purposelie) prepar'd, And digt it deep, bot fall Deserv'dlie, in the ditch ensnaired, For others made, hee shall. 16 His wicked plotts all, which by slight Of violence he wroght, At last sall on his own head light, And back on him be broght. 17As righteous, I the Lord did try His praise I will proclaime; Sing praise will I vnto the high Jehovah's holie name. VIII. 1 Lord, our Lord, in all earth thy name How excellent wee prove! Thy glory heaven's most glorious frame Who hast advanc'd above.2 From babs' and sucklings' mouths thy might Who foundst, thy foes to foyle, To still the enemie; his spight, In whom revenge doth boyle. 3 When as thy heavins (in beautie bright) Before my eyes ar broght, The moone, the twinckling starrs of night, Works, by thy finger wroght;4 O what is man, that him so much Thow mindst, a thing so vaine? Or what the sonne of man, that such To visite thow shouldst daigne? 5 For lytle wnder Angells' state Thow stablishd hast his seed; With honour and with glorie great, Thow hast adorn'd his head.6 Him thow preferrd, as Lord found meet, O're all thy works to raigne; All, dooing homage at his feett, Proclame him soveraigne. 7 Him flocks and heards, both wyld and tame, Beasts of the feeld, obey; Nor foule nor fish his chairge disclame, Through clouds or seas w?? stray. Whatever sorts these paths frequent Subdud thow hast the same. Lord, our Lord, O how excellent In all earth is thy name. IX. 17 No mercie shal the Godles get, But (heidlongs) hurld in hell, With natiouns all, that God forgett, In vttir darknes duell.18 For, not for evir shall the poore O'repast, affliction sie, Nor shall their hopes, who wrongs endure, Still disapointed be. 19 Arise, O Lord, thin arme forth streach! Shall worms of earth prevaill? To tremble at thy judgments teach Thy foes, perplex'd and pale.20 Schaik thow ther hearts: thy terrors show, That mortales most who dare, The heathen nations all, may know That but frail flesh they are. X. 1 Whence is it (Lord) that thow afar, At distance standst of place; On ws when times of trouble are, Whence dost thow hide thy face?2 The wicked in their pride persue The poore. Be they surprisd, O let them not the slights eschue The snairs themselves devis'd. 3 For of his soul's desire the bad Doth boast; by him is blest Thee greedie wretch whom gain maks glade, Whom God doth much detest.4 The wicked through the passing pride That his big looks bewray, To seek, or think of God, asyd He holdeth from his way. 5 Most greevous alwayes ar his wayes; Thy judgments from his sight Are farr remov'd; no foe him frayes; Hee mocks bot at ther might.6 Hee firmelie in his hart doth hold His state no tyme can tosse; Nor shall adversitie make bold, Hee dreams, his wayes to crosse. 7 His execrable mouth dar vent Fraud, cursing and deceat; His tongue with wickednes acquent, Of mischeef is the seat.8 For vilages, darne parts hee lyes, And secreit slaughtir maks Of Innocents. W? half closd eyes, At poore-ones ayme hee taks. 9 Much like a lyon in his denne Hee lurks, and lyes at wait; Hee lyes at wait to catch poor men; The poore, by his deceat10 Are catch'd, when draun into his nett. He croutcheth, stouping low, That weak ones by his strenth may gett The greater ovirthrow. 11 To him his lying heart suggests That God hath this forgott, And hids his face. Secure he rests On this,—God sies him not.12 Arise, O Lord, God, great in might, Raise thy revenging hand. Let not the poore afflicted wight, Neglected longer stand. 13 Why should the wicked in contempt Of God, this freedome take? In hart (whatevir hee attempt) Hee dreams no coumpt to mak.14 Thow siest, yea, vexing wrongs thow vieust; Thy hand shall spite repay, The poore, the pupil, rescust, Persew'd to bee made prey. 15 O breck the arme, the pow'r represse Of wicked men and ill, Till none thow fynd; their wickednes, Their sins be searching still.16 The Lord doth raigne, king over all, To all eternity. Of heathens (by their vttir fall), His land hee hath sett frie. 17 Lord, thow the poore hast dain'd to heare, And granted what they crave. Thow stablish wilt their hearts; thin care Attentive they shall have.18 For the opprest, who thee implore, For pupils thow wilt plead, As judge; that man of earth no more May to oppresse proceid. XI. 1 My trust is in the Lord; vnto My soule how say yee then Flee to your mountaine, as a bird, For (loe) vngodlie men2 Doe bend their bowes; vpon the string Their shafts they readie mak, At such as vpright are in heart Ayme, vnawars, to take. 3 What can the righteous do, destroy'd Iff the foundations bee?4 In temple of his holines, Jehouah, the most high, Jehouah hath his throne in heaven, What passeth hee espyes; His eyelids try the sonns of man;5 The just Jehouah tryes. But men perverse, and cruellie Inclind, his soule disdaines.6 Vpon them snares, fire, brimstone, storms Most terrible hee raines, 7Their cup's due portion. For the Lord Most righteous, doth delight In righteousnes; who righteous are Find favour in his sight XII. 1 The Godlie ceaseth; succour Lord: The faithfull ar growne few2 Amongst the sonnes of men, in speech They vanitie persew. Each with his neighbour, with the lip Of flattrie speek they faire, But w? a heart and heart within Their brests by words ensnair. 3 The Lord all lips that licence take, By flattrie to abuse, All loftie tongs, expressions proude Which arrogantlie vse,4 Sall quite cutt off; which say, our tongues To ws our ends sall gain: Our lips ar ours: Who sall, as Lord, Their libertie restraine? 5 The poore, opprest and robt, to right, Bot now will I arise, The neidie who doe sigh, to save, From such as them despise,6 The Lord hath said: The Lord whose words Are, as the silver, pure, In earthen fornace sevin tymes find, Which tryall doeth endure. 7 To them for ever, Thow, O Lord, Wilt a protecto? prove, And from this generation bade, Preserve them from above.8 No way wnwalk't the wicked leave, To each hand turne they then, When as the vilest ar advanced Amongst the so?s of men. XIII. 1 How long wilt thow forgett me Lord? For evir shall it bee? How long wilt thow withdraw thy face, And hyd thy selff from me?2 How long take counsell in my soule Shall I, whill daylie grow My greevs of hart? How long insult Sall ovir me my foe? 3 My sute let weght and hearing haue, O Lord my God, with thee; Lest death's cold sleep seal vp my sight, Mine eyes with light supplie;4 Lest over him prevaild I have, By my proud foe be sayd, And the opposers of my peace, When I am mov'd be glade. 5 My trust is in thy mercie; still Shall thy salvation be My joy of heart. To God I'le sing, Who hath delt weell with me. XIV. 1 The fooll hath (closlie) in his heart, For a conclusioun laid, And (secreettlie within himselff) No God their is, hath sayd. Corrupted all: in all ther wayes They work (with maine and might) Abhominable works; not one Doth what is good or right. 2 The Lord from heaven, vpon the so?s Of men did sett his eye, Iff any vndirstanding wer, And seeking God to sie.3 All from the way aside ar gone; Togither great and small, Polluted are: none, no not one, Doth any good at all. 4 Doe all lack knowledge, wickednes Who work? devour'd by them As bread my people are: on God To call they doe contemne.5 Thair wer they suddenlie surpris'd With feare, which on them fell, For in the generatioun Of just men God doth duell. 6 Becaus on God the poore depends, His counsell ?ee disdaine.7 O that from Sion Israell Salvation might attaine. What tyme Jehovah back sall bring, From bands and bondage sade, His people, Jacob sall rejoyce, And Israell be glade. XV. 1 Who in thy Tabernacle stay, Lord, who shall dwell with thee2 Vpon thy holie mount? the man That walketh vprightlie, Who just is in his works, and wayes, Whose mouth and minde aggree3 In speiking truth. Whose harmles tongue Is from backbiteing free. Hee who his freind to hurt forbears, And carefullie taks heid His neighbour nor defam'd to hear, Nor his reproach to spread.4 Vile persons, in whose purer eyes Contemptible appear; But faithfull men, that fear the Lord, Ar honord and held dear. Hee to his hurt, thogh haveing sworne, Whose faith no change doth stayne.5 By biteing vs?rie who makes Not, by his money, gayne. Hee gainst the innocent for bribes Who hath not partiall prov'd. The man who these things shall attayne Shall in no time be mov'd. XVI. 1 Preserve me, for on thee, O God, My confidence is stayd.2 Wnto the Lord, my Lord thow art, Thow, O my soule, hast sayd. 3Not vnto thee, vnto the saincts On earth, the excellent (All my delyte who are) alone My goodnes hath extent. 4 Who gifts to Gods besyde thee, give, Their greevs shall greatlie grow; Not their drink offerings, horrible With blood, will I bestow. Ther names not in my lips will I5 Tak vp. The Lord (no lesse) Of my inheritance and cup For portioun I possesse. 6 Mainteener of my lote thow art; By line is fallen to me A pleasant partage: yea a fair Inheritance, of thee7 Doe I enjoy. I'le blesse the Lord Whose counsell gives me light. Me also doe my reins instruct, In silence of the night. 8 Before me alwayes have I sett The Lord; (sure) I sall stand, And not be mov'd, since him (for help) I have at my right hand.9 Joy haue I therfor in my heart; With glaidnesse is possest My glorie; in assured hope, My flesh sall also rest. 10 For (sure) my soule sall not in grave Deserted be by thee, Nor wilt thow lett thy holie one (In death) corruption sie. 11Lyff's path thow wilt me point; joyes full Enjoying sall I stand Before thee; pleasures evirmoir, O Lord, at thy right hand. XVII. 1 Give eare, O Lord; regaird the right; Vnto my cry attend; Give eare, for vnto thee my suit From lips vnfaind I send.2 Wouchaise furth from before thy face, My sentence may proceid; O lett thyne eyes behold and grant What equitie doeth plead. 3 My hart thow prov'd, me visited By night, didst tryall send, Bot nothing shallt thow fynd; I mynde My mouth sall not offend.4 Concerning lawles practises Of men, thy lips' pure word Preservs, by thee, destroyar's path That I do not debord. 5 Stay in thy pathes my steps, that fast6 My feet may stand. 6. To thee I call, for thow wilt hear, O God; Encline thine eare to me;7 Heare my complaint. 7. Thow, (whose right hand To save y? is not slow That in thee trust, from cruell foes), Thy wondrous mercy show. 8 Me as the apple of thyn eye, Secure on evrie syd.9 Beneath the shaddow of thy wings Me from th' vngodlie hyd, My proud oppressours, mortall foes, Who are around me layd;10 Encloisde w? their oune fatt, whose mouths Most boldlie me vpbraid. 11 Our footsteps now they compast haue, And sett on ws ther eyes,12 Close crouching to the ground, 12. as when At wait a lyon lyes, When eagerlie vpon his prey To rush is his intent; Or, in darne parts, as lyons' whelps Lurk, when to ravin bent. 13 Vp, Lord, prevent him; cast him doun. From wicked men, thy sword,14 My soule deliuer thow. 14. from men, Which are thy hand, O Lord; From men, such of this world as are, Who in this lyff receaue Ther portion; and ther bellies fild With thy hidd treasures haue. In children who abounding be, And carefullie provyde That what they leaue ther babs may brook, Quhich after them abide.15 Bot as for me, in righteousnes, Lord, I thy face shall sie, When as awak'd, the liknesse shall Me fully satisfie. XVIII. Inscript. From all his foes, and from the sword Of Saul: the servant of the Lord, David delyvered, sung (most glade) This song of praise to God, and sayd. [The First Part] 1 Thee, Lord, entearlie will I love, My strength who art and stay.2 My fort, my rock, and my releeff The Lord is evrie way. My God and my strong hold, on whom Is fix'd my confidence, My sheeld and my salvation's horne, My castle of defence. 3 My voyce I'le lift vnto the Lord, To whom all praise is due; So from mine adversaries all His hand shall me rescue.4 Death's pangs mee compast, mee the floods Of Belial affray'd;5 Hell's sorows me besett, death's snares Me to prevent wer lay'd. 6 In straits I sought the Lord, with cryes I to my God drew near; Hee from his temple heard my voyce, My cryes came to his eare.7 Straight troubled earth a trembling fell, Fear did its pillars shaike; The mountains low foundations mov'd, Did at His presence quaike. 8 For wroth Hee was. His nostrils smoak Sent forth, devoureing fire Flam'd from His mouth, that coalls therat Wer kindled, through His ire. 9From high discending, for mine aide, Heavens vnto Him made way. By Him bow'd doun, beneath his feet Thick clouds did dimme the day. The Secound Part. 10 Upon a glorious cherub sett Hee rode, and nimblie flew: Winds did their wings display, on which Hee wondrous swiftnes shew.11 Hee darknes made his secret place, And did around him stent, For a pavilion, waters black, Clouds of the firmament. 12 At brightnes of the blazeing beams That issued from his sight, His thick clouds vanish'd, sudden hayle And coals of fire did fright.13 The Lord did thunder in the heavens, The Highest gave his voyce; Hayle was hurld doun, and flames of fire Brack forth with fearefull noise. 14 His arows shoureing doun, their bands Hee brack, and chargeing new, With shot of lightening from the skyes, Them vtterlie o're-threw.15 Floods channells seen, discov'red wer, O Lord, at thy rebuike, The world's low grounds, which at the blasts Breath'd from thy nostrils, shooke. The Thrid Part. 16 From high hee sent, and took my hand, And from great deeps me drew.17 From my strong foe, from haters' spight His strength did me rescue, When too, too strong for me they wer, And in the cloudie day Of my distresse did me prevent; Me then the Lord did stay. 19 Hee to a large place forth me brought, Hee my delyverer prov'd, Becaus in me Hee took delight And much his servant lov'd.20 According to my righteousnes The Lord rewarded me, As pure and cleane my hands hee found, So recompensed hee. 21 His wayes I kept, and wickedlie My God I did not leave.22 His judgments sett in sight, I still Did to his statuts cleave.23 Before him straight, me from my sin24 I kept. So rendred hee, In me as straightnes, in my hands As hee did cleannesse see. 25 Thow mercifull thy self wilt shew, With such as mercie love; Most vpright shall the vpright man,26 The pure Thee pure shall prove. But who so froward are, thy frounes27 Shall find; for, never slow To save the sad afflicted soule, Proud looks thow shalt bring low. The Fourth Part. 28 My Lamp thow lights; the Lord my God My darknes will mak day.29 By thee I troups break forth; my God Maks walls to me plaine way.30 God's path is perfyte, try'd thy word, O Lord, is wondrous pure; To all that put their trust in him A sheild hee is most sure. 31 For who, beside the Lord, is God? Who save our God, a rock?32 God, who with strength me girds about (So to sustaine a chock);33 My way who perfyte makes; my feet Who with the hynds doth match; Who on my places high me setts And ever me doth watch. 34 Mine hands hee fitts for armes, mine armes Maks break a bow of brasse.35 Lord, by thy saftie's shield secur'd, Through foes I feareles passe. Thy right hand me vpholds, encreast Hath me thy clemencie.36 Thow hast enlarg'd my steps, and firme My feet makes vnder me. 37 My foes I charg'd and took; nor turnd I, till they perished all.38 I wounded them, they could not rise, Made at my feet to fall.39 For war with valour me thow girdst, Low my oppressors layes.40 The necks thow givst me of my foes, The sword my haters slayes. 41 They cry'd but all in vaine, for none, In straits, was them to save; Even to the Lord aloud they cry'd, The Lord no ansuer gave.42 Then did I bruise them small as dust, By wynds disperst abroad, And caist them out like myre in streets Which vnder foot is trod. The Fifth Part. 43 From vproars of the multitude By the preserv'd; made head Of heathen nations, not known, To serve me I shall lead.44 They at my fame shall stoup: to me Do homage strangers shall.45 They, frayd, shall fad away and leave Their lurking places all. 46 The Lord doth live, blest be my Rock, (My strength and solid stay); The God of my salvation, Exalted be for ay.47 God who for me doth execute Revenge, and doth subdue48 My people vnder me; whose hand Me saves, when foes persue. Me over those that gainst me rise, Thow raisest. Thow alone Most gratiouslie delyvered hast Mee from the cruell one.49 Lord, therfore solemne thanks will I Amongst the heathen give To Thee; even to thyne holie name, Sing prayses whill I live. 50 Delyverance great he gives his King; To his anointed sure, To David and his seed, for ay His mercie shall endure. XIX. [The First Part] 1 God's glorie heavens declair, the skyes His handie work delate.2 Day speeks to day, and night to night Doth knowledge intimate.3 Heard everie where their language is, Where speech or tongue is known.4 Throughout the earth their line, their words Through all the world ar gone. 5 Thair for the sun a tent hee sett, Which to his task steps out From his bed chamber, bridgroome-like, And as a Campion stout, Joyes, readie to renew his race,6 The outmost ends of heaven Whose course begin and compasse close, Whence heat to all is givin. The Second Part. 7 God's law is perfite, leading home The soule self-lost which lyes. His Testimoney's firme and sure, The simple making wise.8 The statuts of the Lord rejoyce The heart, for they are right. His precepts pure the darkest eyes Illuminat with light. 9 The fear of God is vndefil'd, And doth endure for ay. The judgments of the Lord are true, And righteous everie way.10 Much more to be desyrd then gold, Then much fine gold they are. The honey and the honey-combe They passe in sweetnes far. 11 By them thy servant (watchfull made), Is warn'd of dangers deep. Exceeding great is their reward Them carefullie who keep.12 His errours who can vnderstand? From close sins cleanse thow me;13 O keep thy servant back from such As of presumption be. Their strong dominion over me Destroy; their strength abate; So shall I cleane and innocent Be, from transgression great.14 O let my words, my hart's hid thoughts, Acceptable appear Before thy face. O Lord, my Rock, And my Redeemer deare. XX. 1 In straits the Lord thee heare; the name Of Jacob's God most high2 Defend thee; furnisch thee with aide, Sent from the sanctuarie; From Sion may hee the sustain,3 And all thy offrings minde; With him may thy brunt sacrifice, (Consum'd), acceptance fynde. 4 Thy hart's desirs all may hee grant; Thy counsells all fullfill,5 In thy salvation rejoyce, Our banners spread wee will In name of God, our God. The Lord Fulfill all thow canst crave.6 The high Jehovah, wel I know, Doth his anointed save. He from his heaven of holinesse To him give hearing will, By strength of the salvation Found in his right hand still.7 In chariots some, some putt their trust In horses; but wee flie Vnto the Lord: Our God's great name Alone remember wee. 8 They, foyld, ar fallen, risen wee9 Do stand. To save draw neare, O Lord; when as wee call, the King Let to our sutes give eare. XXI. 1 Lord, in thy strength the King sall joy; How sall his gladnes grow2 In thy salvation? To his minde Thow makst his maters goe. His lips' requeist withholdst thow not.3 With blessings manifold Of goodnes him provydst. Thow crounst His heid with purest gold. 4 Lyff askt hee, lyffe to him thow gavst,For ever length of dayes.5 In thy salvation glorie great He hath. Him thow arayes With honour and high majestie.6 For euer more most blest Thou hast him made; thy face his joy Hath to the full encreast. 7 For in the Lord the king doth trust, And sall i?oveably, Establisht through the mercies, stand, Of him who is most high.8 Thyne hand thy foes sall all fynd out, Thy right hand, who the hate.9 A flameing fornace shalt thow mak Them, in thy furie great. Consume them shall the Lord in wrath, Devoure them shall the fire.10 Their fruit from earth, their seed thow shalt From mankind make expire.11 For they against thee evill have Intended; did devise Mischeevous plotts, which in ther pow're Not to accomplish lyes. 12 Them shalt thow therfor make thy mark, Thine arrowes on the strings When as thow fitts, and suddenly Them 'gainst their faces bringes. 13In thine oune strength, O mayst thow still Exalted be, O Lord. So sall wee sing, and to thy pow're Shall to give prayse accord. XXII. Inscript. The morneing's Hinde, by David view'd, By murdring dogs to death persu'd. 1 My God, my God, why dost thow me Desert? From my releeff So far why standst thow, from the words Which I roare forth for greefe?2 My God, by day I cry vnheard, Night doth no peace impart;3 But in Israel's prayse[s] thow Who dwelst, most holie art. 4 On thee our fathers fix'd their trust; Them (trusting) thow didst save.5 To thee they cry'd; Thow (Lord) with speed To them deliverie gave.6 They trusting wer absolv'd from shame; But I, no man at all, Am even a worme, the shame of men, Depis'd of great and small. 7 None see me but of me do make Of scorne a publick prey. Their lips all open me to mock; They shake the head and say:8 For safe deliverie on the Lord Himselff hee did roll over; Now if in him hee tak delight, Him let his hand recover. 9 But thow art hee who from the wombe, Me (weakling) forth didst take; When hanging on my mother's breasts, To hope thow didst me make.10 Cast on thee from the wombe I was, O God, my God thow art; Since, from my mother's bellie, breath To me thow didst impart. 11 Draw neare, for troubles are at hand, And none to help is found.12 Me many bulls besett, strong bulls Of Bashan close me round.13 To ravening, roareing lions like To gape on me they dare.14 Like waters I am powred forth. My bones disjointed are. My fainting hart, like yeelding waxe, Is melted in my breast.15 My moisture as a sopelesse sheard, Is quite consum'd and ceast. Fast to my jawes my tonge, as ty'd, Of speech no freedome hath; Thy chastening hand hath brought me doun Vnto the place os death. 16 For dogs me compast have; even troups Of wicked men did meet, Who me environing around, Did peirce my hands and feet.17 My bones I all may tell at ease. They gaze on me, they stare;18 They loats vpon my coat did cast, My vesture 'mongst them share. 19 But be not absent, O my strength,20 To help me; from the sword My soule, my dareling from the dog, To save mak hast, O Lord.21 O hasten, from the gapeing jawes Of lions me to save; For, from the hornes of vnicornes, Thine eare (Lord) found I have. 22 Vnto my brethren I thy name Will publicklie declare, And to the church, amidst thy saints, To prayse thee will repair.23 Who fear the Lord him prayse: all yee, From Jacob's stock that spread, Him glorifie and praise; him fear, All yee Israel's seed. 24 For the afflicted wight broght low, Hee never doth despise; Nor him abhorreing, hids his face, But heareth when hee cryes.25 Amidst the congregation great, My prayse shall be of thee; Before their face that fear the Lord, Perform'd my vowes shall bee. 26 The meek shall eat and be sufficd. Due prayses shall they give, Who do sinceerlie seek the Lord; Your hearts for aye shall live.27 Earth's borders all remember shall, And turne vnto the Lord. The kindreds of the nations all Shall worship due afford. 28 The Lord's the Kingdome is: Hee rule Doth 'mongst the nations beare.29 The fatt ones of the earth shall eat, And worshippeing draw neare. Yea, all that to the dust go doun, Shall prostrate in his sight Be seen; and none shall keep alive His soule, by proper might. 30 A seed, a remnant small shall serve, And gladlie him obey, A generation to the Lord It shall be held for ay.31 They shall draw neare, and to a race To lyff as yet vnbrought, His Righteousnes declare, that this The Lord himself hath wrought. XXIII. 1 The Lord my sheepheard is, of want I never shall complain;2 For me to rest on, hee doth grant Greene pastures of the plaine.3 Hee leads me stillest streams beside, And doth my soule reclame. In righteous paths hee doth me guide, For glorie of his name. 4 The valley darke of death's aboade To passe, I'le feare no ill; For Thow art with me, Lord, thy rod And staffe me comfort still. 5For me a table Thow dost spread In presence of my foes. With oyle thow dost anoint mine head; By the my cup or'flowes. 6 Mercie and goodnes all my dayes With me shall surelie stay, And in thy house, thy name to praise, Lord I will dwell for ay. XXIV. 1 Earth and its fullnes are the Lord's, The world and there who stay;2 For He on seas it founded firme, On floods its grounds did lay.3 His hill ascend, his holie place For stay who shall attaine?4 The man whose hands are vndefild, Whose heart doth pure remaine. He who his soule hath not lift vp To vanitie, nor swears5 Deceatfullie: He from the Lord, Away the blessing bears; Evin righteousnes from God, who doth6 Him save. This is the race Of them that seek him; them that seek (O Jacob's God) thy face. 7 Lift, O yee gats, lift vp ?our heads; Yee doires that last alway, Be ye lift vp, that enter in The King of Glorie may. 8Who is this glorious King? The Lord, The strong and mightie one: The Lord, most mightie, gainst his foes When forth to battle gone. 9 Lift, O yee gats, lift vp your heads; Yee doors that last alway, Be yee lift vp, that enter in The King of Glorie may.10 This mightie King that comes, this King Of Glorie, who is hee? Jehouah King of Glorie is, The Lord of Hosts most high. XXV. 1 To thee my soule, O Lord, 2 I lift. My God, in thee I trust; me save from schame, my foes Let not triumph or' me.3 Yea, none let be asham'd That wait on thee: Be they Asham'd who fruitlesslie offend, And falslie fall away. 4 Schew me thy wayes, O Lord, Thy paths to me mak playne;5 Let in thy treuth, and to be taught Of thee, lett me obtaine. For thow alone the God Of my Salvation art; On thee (wnwearied), all the day, I wait with patient hart. 6 Thy tender bowells, Lord, Thy mercyes manifold, Call to remembrance, for they have For ever been of old.7 Passe by my sins of youth, Voide my transgressions make; After thy mercie minde thow me, (Lord), for thy goodnes' sake. 8 The Lord, most kinde and just, Will sinners teach which stray.9 The meek in judgement hee will guyd, Evin teach the meek his way.10 His paths all mercie are, And treuth, to all yat keeps His covenant, and hide in heart His testimonies deep. 11 The, for thine oune names sake, O Lord, I do entreate, O pardoun my iniquitie, For it is hudgly great.12 What man is hee that fears The Lord? Him in the way That hee sall chuise the Lord sall teach;13 At ease his soule sall stay. His seed inherite shall14 The earth. To them that fear The Lord, disclosd his counsell is; His covenant made clear.15 At all times will I keep Wpon the Lord a constant eye; For from the nett, by him my feet Sett free, escape shall I. 16 Turne, (Lord), thy face and me Thy mercie's object mak, For desolate and sore distresst, Me to thy grace I tak.17 The troubles of my hart, Still greater on me grow; To me, when in my straits I sticke, A gracious outgate thow. 18 Lett my affliction, (Lord), My payne compassion move; Beheld by thee, do all my sins Farre from thy sight remove.19 Look on my foes, for they Are manie, full of spight20 Their hatred is. Preserve my soule, O save me by thy might. Lett me not be ashamd, Becaus my trust's in thee.21 Integrity and vprightnesse Let my preservers be. For on thee do I wayt.22 Good in thy sight let seeme, Out of his troubles all, (O Lord), Thy Israel to redeeme. XXVI. 1 Judge me, O Lord, for that the way In w?? I walk is just. I shall not slide, for on the Lord Establisht is my trust. 2Me prove, examine me; my reins, My heart explore and try.3 For to thy loveing kindnes, Lord, I alwayes have ane eye. 4 Thy truth my way I make. I shune To sitt with persouns vain; With close dissemblers to goe in My feett I do refraine.5 I hate the company of those Whose practices are ill, Not sitt in the societie Of wicked men I will. 6 With hands in innocency cleansd, I compasse will, O Lord,7 Thine altar, and with gratefull voice Will publick praise afford;8 Evin all thy wondrous works declare. The place of thy aboad O how I love! the place wherin Thy Glorie dwells, O God. 9 My soule with sinners gather not, Nor me from life remove10 With bloodie men, whose guiltie hands Mischeevous plotts promove. Their right hands with corrupting brybs11 Ar fild, but as for me, O Lord, I constantlie will walk In my integritie. Redeeme me, to thy grace I fly;12 By thee my foot stands evin, Midst the assembly. To the Lord, By me shall prayse be given. XXVII. 1 The Lord my light, my saftie is, Of whom shall I be frayed? The Lord the strength is of my life, Who me shall make dismayed?2 When to devoure my flesch my foes, (Fierce adversaries all), The wicked came vpon me, streight They stumbled and did fall. 3 Though pitch against me should ane hoast, From fear my heart's secured. Though war should rise, and gainst me rage, In war am I assuird.4 I one thing of the Lord have sought, That will I seek for still, That in the house of God my lif's Wholl course I may fullfill. That with the beuty of the Lord There I may fill mine ey; And in his sanctuary still Be makeing inquiry.5 For his pavilion shall hee draw About me in the day Of trouble; covered with his tent, In secret I sall stay. Thow shall me hyde, and on a rock6 Me raise. My foes above Mine head shall be lift'd vp, even those Which do around me move. Thence to his tabernacle shall I joyfull offrings bring. Yea, I will sing, evin to the Lord Due prayses will I sing. 7 Heare, when my voyce I lift and cry; Haue mercy, Lord, on me; A gratious ansuer lett me haue.8 Thow saidst, my face seek yee; Seek, Lord, thy face will I, my heart To the again did say.9 Hid not from me thy face, nor wroth, Thy servant turne away. Thow hithirto hast been myne help, From me now do not part; O leave me not, thow who the God Of my salvation art.10 Although my father, yea, thogh me My mother did foirsake, Yett surely shall the Lord evin then Me gather and wptake. 11 Teach me thy way and in a path Of plainnesse, Lord, me lead, Becaus of those that ly at wait, To mark how I proceed.12 Me to discretion of my foes, O give not, for ther bee Who gainst me rise, that wittnes lyes, And breath out crueltie. 13 God's goodnes in the land of life, Vnlesse I look't to sie, Full long ere now I fainted had.14 Wayt, wayt yee patientlie Wpon the Lord; encourag'd bee, Hee strenghten shall thine heart. To wayt with patience on the Lord, Lett alwayes be thy part. XXVIII. 1 To thee, Lord, will I cry, my strength. To me be thou not still; Lest, if thow silence keep, I bee Like those the grave who fill.2 My supplications' voice, O heare, With cryes when I draw nigh, And at thy holie oracle, My hands lift vp on high.Ezek. 32. 20. Job 21. 33. 3 Me from the Godles, wickednes Who work, in death devide, Whose harts, (whill to y? neighbours peace They speek), doe mischeif hide.4 O give them what is to ther deeds, Their bade endeavours due; As with polluted hands they did Leud practises persew. Giue them, O giue them their desart. The works of God they slight, And how his hands of kings dispose, Considdir not aright.5 Them shall he therfore overturne, And not the breach repaire.6 Blest be the Lord, for hee the voice Of my requests doth heare. 8 His prayse my song shal be. 8. A strength In straits wnto all his, The Lord to his anoynted one, A strength for saiftie is.9 Thy people and inheritance, Let sav'd and blessed be; Be they sustained and lifted vp, For ever, Lord, by thee. XXIX. 1 Give to the Lord, yee mighty, strength; Give glory to the Lord.2 Wnto the Lord the glory due Wnto his name afford. In bewtie of pure holynes, To worship him appeare.3 The high Jehovah's dreadfull voice, Wpon the waters heare; The God of Glorie thundring is, Vpon the wattirs great;4 The Lord's, the Almighty's [awfull] voice In majesty and state.5 In pow'r his voice is heard, to ground His voyce tall cedars strecks; The cedars tall of Lebanon The Lord in peeces brecks. 6 He maks them like a calfe to skip; Mount Lebanon layd deep, On solide grounds, and Sirion, like Light vnicornes to leap.7 The Lord's voice flames of fyre devids.8 His voice the desart shaikes; Yea, at the dreadfull voyce of God, Waist Kadesh desart quaikes. 9 Hynds at the voice of God doe calve, Discov'red forrests are; And in his glorious palice hard Is glorie evrie where.10 God at the flood did sitt, yea sitt For evir king hee shall.11 The Lord will giue his people strengh; W? peace, evin blesse you all. XXX. Thus prayse did Dauid celebrate, His House when he did dedicate. 1 I will extoll thee, for thow hast Me lifted vp, O Lord, And over me not ground of joy, Didst to my foes afford.2 To thee I cry'd, O Lord my God, And health of thee I haue.3 Thow, Lord, my soule rescued, and back Hast brought me from the grave. From goeing doun into the pitt, Me hast thow kept aliue.4 With songs of joy, vnto the Lord, Due praise doe yee ascriue, His holines rememb'ring, giue Him thanks, yee Saincts of his.5 For, but a moment lasts his wrath, Life in his favor is; At night continow mourning may, But mirth the morning brings.6 I never shall be mov'd I sayd, Pufft vp with outward things.7 But, Lord, thy love and favor free Thow hast me taught at length; My mountaine onlie mak to stand, Establisht by thy strength. Thow hiddst thy face, my troubles grew:8 My cryes then I renew'd; To thee, O Lord, evin my request Wnto the Lord persued. 9Wnto the pitt gone doun, my blood When taken what avail'd? Shall ashes prayse thee? or declair Thy truth which never faild? 10 To me, O Lord, a hearing grant, Me in thy mercy take; That me thow mayst with ayde supply, Lord, my addresse I make.11 My mourning into dauncing turn'd; The livery of annoy, My sack cloath, Lord, thow hast putt off, And girded me with joy. 12 This didst thow that my glorie may Sing praise, not silent be. O Lord my God, to thee giue thanks Will I vncessantlie. XXXI. [The first part.] 1 In thee Lord do I trust; asham'd, O never let me be. Me, in thy righteousnes rescue,2 Bow doun thine eare to me. With speed rescue me; be a rock Of strength for me, I crave. Be thow ane house of strong defence, Me to secure and save. 3 My rock, my hold thow art, me lead, Me for thy name's sake guide.4 O pull thow me out of the nett, Which for me they did hide.5 For thow my strength art; in thy hands My spirit I co?end. Thow didst redeeme me, Lord, O God, Whom truth doth ay attend. 6 Such have I hated as vaine lyes Regaird: In God I trust.7 Thy mercie joy and gladnes gives. My greevs, O thow, most just, Considred hast; yea knoune my soule When in adversitie;8 And not in foes' hand shut me vp, But hast my feet sett free. The second part. 9 Vpon me troubles sore tak hold, Have mercie, Lord, on me; With sorrow quite consum'd, my sight, My soule, my bowels be.10 My life is spent with greife, my years With sighing; fail'd in me Is strength; my bones ar eaten vp, Through my iniquitie. 11 A mocking stock made, a reproch Am I become to all My foes, bot to my neighbours most. Feare, for my caus, doth fall On my familiars; who without Do see me, shift my sight.12 As of a dead man, out of mynd, All my remembrance slight. I like a brocken vessell am.13 Me manie do persue, With causles slanders. From all sids My fears ar not a few, While as, consulting 'gainst my life, By them deep plots wer lay'd.14 But in Thee is my trust: O Lord, My God thow art, I sayd. 15 My times are in thy hands; from hands Of my insulting foes Rescue me; such as persecute My life doe thow oppose.16 Thy face mak on thy servant shine. Me of thy mercie save. Let me not be asham'd, O Lord, For cald on Thee I have. The thrid part. 17 Let wicked men be put to shame, And to the grave be sent In silence; shut thow vp the lips Which lyes do baselie vent;18 Which proudlie and contemptuouslie, Dare righteous men vpbrayde; And things that hard and greevous are, Vnto their charge have layd. 19 For them that feare the, O how great Thy bountye's treasures be; Thy workes before the sonns of men, For them that trust in thee!20 Thy presence secreet from man's pride Thow maks their hiding place; And keeps them in a tent secure, From strife of tonges at peace. 21 For ever blessed be the Lord, For hee his tender love Hath, in a fenced citie, made Me wondrouslie to prove.22 For, from thine eyes cutt off I am, I, in my hast, had say'd. My voyce yet heardst thow, when to thee, With cryes my moane I made. 23 Love yee the Lord, his saints. The Lord The faithfull doth preserve; And plentifullie doth repay The proud, as they deserve.24 Tak courage yee, with patient hope Who on the Lord depend; For, (sure) to your oppressed hearts, Hee strength in straits shall send. XXXII. Inscript. Heer David to a Key doth reach Spirituall knowledge which doth teach. 1 Blest, O how highlie blest is hee, Whose pardon's past in heaven, For his transgressions all; whose sins Are covered and forgiven.2 Blest hee, to whom the Lord hath not Impute iniquitie, And in whose vpright spirit hid Is no hypocrisie. 3 When silence I did keep, my bones Pin'd peece and peece away, And waxed old, by reasoun of My roareing all the day. 4 For day and night thy chastning hand Vpon me heavie was: My moisture quite dry'd vp, the drought Of su?er did surpasse. 5 My faults then manifest I made, And did no covering take To cloake my sin. I sayd I wold A free confession make Of my transgressions, to the Lord; So Thow my pardon seal'd, And didst passe by my punishment, The wage that sin doth yeeld. 6 For this the saincts shall seek to Thee, What tyme Thow mayst be found. They surelie shall be safe when floods, Great floods, them rage around.7 My hideing place thow art, in straits Preserv'd I am by thee: With songs of safe deliverance, Lord, thow shalt compasse me. Second part. 8 Teach and point out will I thy path, Lest thow be led aside, And, that thow mayst in saftie walk, Mine eye thy steps shall guide.9 Be not of vnderstanding voyd, As are the horse and mule, Whose mouth, to thee least they come neare, The bitt and reine must rule. 10 The wickeds' sorows shall exceed, But hee his trust who stayes Vpon the Lord, with mercie shall Environ'd be alwayes.11 In God be glade, rejoice all yee Who follow righteousnes; Shout, all who vpright are in heart, Your Joyes aloud expresse. XXXIII. 1 Joy in the Lord, yee just; prayse such Beseems as vpright be.2 Praise yee the Lord with harp; to him Sing with the psaltery; With ten string'd instruments him prayse.3 A new song to him sing; With a triumphing noise expresse Your skill, by voice and string. 4 For right the word is of the Lord, His works in treuth all wrought.5 Hee equitie affects, and deare Is judgement, in his thoght. Fild with his goodnes is the earth.6 Heavens by his word wer made, And, by the spirit of his mouth, With glorious hosts arayd. 7 Seas' liquid waves hee doth collect, As on a solid heap, And, in his secreet treasuries, The deeps in store doth keep.8 Fear him all earth. Let all him fear, Who in the world doe live;9 For, at his word it was, and stands As hee co?and did giue. 10 The heathen's counsells hee doth caus Evanisch as most weake, And all the peoples' policyes, Maks no effect to take.11 But all his counsells (as decrees), Shall stand establisht sure; The thoughts that hid are in his hart, From race to race endure. 12 O happie nation, which for God Jehouah hath! whom hee, A people for himselff, hath chuis'd His heritage to be.13 He looks from heaven and doth behold The sonns of men from thence;14 On all earth's duellers, from the throne Of his high residence. 15 Their harts he fashioneth alike,And doth consider right16 Of all their works. No king is sav'd By multitude or might; The strong not by much strength doth stand.17 A horse a thing most vaine Is for releeff; by his great strength None saftie shall attaine. 18 Behold, the Lord a gracious eye On them that feare him, hath; On them that in his mercie hope,19 Ther souls to save from death, Yea, evin in famine them to feed.20 On him our souls do wait:21 Our help and sheeld he is. In him Our joy of heart is great. For, in his holie name was still22 Our trust. O still extend To ws thy mercie, as on thee Our hope, (Lord) doth depend. XXXIV. Inscript. When King Abimelech did chase, And David dryve away, in face And gesture chang'd; so soon as gone, By him this psalme of prayse was done. 1 Still will I blesse the Lord: Him still To prayse will I employ2 My mouth. My soule in him shall boast; The meek shall heare and joy.3 Jointlie his name let ws extoll, Him magnifie with me.4 I sought the Lord; Hee ansuer made, And me from fears sett free. 5 To Him when they shall look, his light Ther darknes shall dispell; Their faces shall not be asham'd.6 This poore man (they shall tell) Cry'd and came speed; from all his straits The Lord did lead him out;7 The Lord whose angell Him who fear Saves and encamps about. 8 How good the Lord is, tast and see. O highlie happie they9 That in him trust! Him fear, his saincts, For them no wants dismay10 That do him fear. Young lions lack, Them penury may daunt; But who sinceerlie seek the Lord, No needfull good shall want. 11 Come children, hearken yee, for I The Lord's fear will you teach.12 What man is good and many dayes Desyres his lyfe to reach?13 From evil do thy tongue refraine; Guile in thy lips eschew.14 Depart from evil and do good; Seek peace and peace persue. 15 The Lord the Righteous eyes; their cry Doth in his eare find place.16 'Gainst evil men, their names from earth To sweep, hee setts his face.17 The Righteous cry, Hee hears; hence peace They from their troubles have.18 Nigh to the brocken heart hee is, And souls contrite doth save. 19 Great are the greevs of godlie men, In number they exceed; But from them all the Lord doth send Releef, as Hee sees need.20 Their bones hee keeps; that none of them Be brocken, hee doth care.21 Them (certainlie) shall evil slay, Who evil doers are. On all shall desolation light That righteous men persue,22 With causles hate. But souls of such As ar his servants true, The Lord from danger shall redeeme: For none to him who flee, And on him wait with confidence, Shall desolation see. XXXV. 1 Striue Lord with them that stryve with me. War on mine enemyes.2 Of scheeld and buckler tak thow hold, And for my help arise.3 My persecuters' way to stop, Bring forth the sword and spear. I thy salvation am, O Lord, Say, that my soule may heare. 4 Who seek my soule, be they to shame And to confusion broght; Turnd back be they, confounded quite, Who harme to me haue thoght.5 Be they like chaffe before the wynd, God's angell them persewing.6 Let dark and slipprie be their way, God's angell them subdewing. 7 For (causlesslie), they in a pitt Have hid for me ther net; Yea, (causlesslie) haue for my soule Dig'd, and devices sett. 8Let ruine him (wnware) surprise; The net which hee did hide Let catch himself; into the same Destruction let him slyde. 9 So in the Lord my soule sall joy, In his salvation glade.10 Lord, who is lyk to thee? by all My bones sall then be said; To Thee, who dost the poore rescue From him who is more strong; The poore and indigent from those, By spoyling would them wrong? 11 False wittnesses arose, and askt Me things I never knew;12 Yea, rendring ill for good, to spoyle My soule vsd arts anew.13 But sack cloath wore I, whil as sick They wer; (my soule broght low With fasting;) back my prayer turn'd To mine owne bosome so. 14 As freend or brother hee had been, I walk'd; with heavinesse Bow'd doun, as at his mother's death One sorrow doth expresse.15 But in my halting, joy they had, And flockt togither fast; The abjects flock against me, while I knew not what had past. 16 They did me teare and ceased not, With counterfitts, who free At feasts are jeasts to breck, they jeared, And gnasht ther teeth at me. 17How long wilt thow look on, O Lord? From their sad ruine draw Thow back my soule, my desolate Soule from the lyon's paw. 18 Thanks will I render wnto Thee, In the assemblie great; And where much people meet, thy prayse Solemnely celebrate.19 Them who wnjustlie are my foes, Let not rejoice at me; Nor, winking with the eye, me scorne, Who hate me causlesslie. 20 For peace they speek not, but contrive, Earth's queyet ones to greeve,21 Deceatfull draughts; and to their mouths, Against me freedome giue. Aha; say they, aha; our eyes Haue seen what bee they wold.22 All this beheld thow hast, O Lord: Now no more silent hold. 23 Bee not farre from me Lord. Rouse wp Thy self to tak my part; To judgement, to my caus awake, My God and Lord who art.24 Judge me, O Lord my God, as just Thow art; rejoyce at me,25 O Let them not, nor say in heart, Ah, now our wills haue wee. Them let not say, him swallowd vp26 Wee haue. 26. Ashamed quite, To joint confusion be they broght, Who in my hurt delyte. Disgrace and shame them cloath, themselvs Who gainst me magnifie;27 But glad be they who haue regaird To my integritie. All such lett shout for joy and say, For ever let the Lord Be magnify'd, who peace wnto His servant did afford; Yea in his peace did pleasure take;28 And of thy righteousnes My tongue sall alwayes talk, evin all The day thy praise expresse. XXXVI. 1 Within my wounded heart have sayd The wicked man's misdeeds, God's feare is not before his eyes.2 For him selff flattrie feeds; His oune iniquityes he smooths, Till hatefull they be found;3 Deceat and open wickednesse Do in his mouth abound. From doing good averse, he hath Given over to be wise.4 Iniquity vpon his bed By night he doth devise. With resolution doth he sett Himself a way to chuise Which is not good; and to abhorre What's evill doth refuise. 5 Thy mercie (Lord) is in the heavens; Thy treuth the clouds doth reach.6 Like mountains of vnmeasur'd hight Thy justice passeth speech. So great a deep thy judgements are, That none can it perceave. From the, O Lord, both man and beast Ther preservation have. 7 How excellent is thy kind love, O God, from race to race. Hence vnder shadow of thy wings Men's sons their trust do place.8 To them the fattnes of thin house Shall in aboundance flow, And of thy pleasur's streams to drink, Their pleasure still shall grow. 9 With thee lyff's fountain is: Wee, (Lord) Light in thy light shall sie.10 Thy loving kindnes vnto them, O lett continow'd bee, To whom thy self made known thow hast; Thy righteousnes extend To all, in vprightnes of heart, That on thee do depend. 11 Wnto the foot of pride a prey, Lord, let me not be found; Nor by the wicked's hand opprest, Constraind to giue them ground.12 There, they to make iniquity Ther work who enterprise, Falne, overthrowne are, and no more Shall able be to rise. XXXVII. [The first part.] 1 Fret not thy self becaus of those That active are in ill; Nor envy thow the man that works Iniquity at will.2 For, like the grasse and budding herb, Which speedilie decay, They shall be suddenlie cutt doun, And quicklie fade away. 3 Trust in the Lord; from what is good Be not to lewdnesse led; So in the land thow long shalt dwell, And verily be fedd.4 Him make thy joy, so satisfie Thy hart's desire shall hee.5 Devolve on Him thy way, and trust The Lord will do for thee. 6 Hee like the light of day shall make Thy righteousnes appeare, And bring thy judgment forth to shyne As noon-day, bright and clear.7 Rest in the Lord, wait patientlie For Him who works these things, And fret not that his wayes go weell, Leud plotts to passe who brings. The Second part. 8 Refraine from furie: vnto wrath Do not give way at all. Fret not thyself in any wise In wickednes to fall; 9 For wicked men shall be cutt off, Their ruine is at hand; But who do wait vpon the Lord, Inherite shall the land. 10 For yet a little while, and lo, The wicked shall not bee. Thow diligentlie shall his place Considder, but not see.11 But by the meek ones of the earth The land shall be possest, And with the pleasurs of sweet peace, Aboundantlie be blest. 12 The wicked plotteth 'gainst the just; His gnashing teeth bewray13 His spight. At him the Lord shall laugh, For neare hee sies his day.14 The wicked drawne the sword, their bows Have bent the murdring wight, The poore to overthrow, and kill The man whose way is right. 15 But into their owne brests the sword Shall pierce, and passage make; And turnd in vselesse shivers, shall The bow to shoot forsake.16 The litle that the righteous hath Is to be prys'd before The wealth of mightie wicked men, Who treasurs have in store. The thrid part. 17 The Lord shall break the wicked's arme, But shall the just sustain.18 Their dayes Hee knowes; their heretage For ever shall remaine. 19 And when bad dayes do danger threat, Shame shall not them confound; They shall sufficientlie be fed, When famine rageth round. 20 The wicked perish shall; God's foes, As fate of lambs by fire Doth melt away, consume they shall, And into smoak expire.21 They borow shall, and take no thoght Their credite to releeve; But mercifull the vpright are, And chearfully do give. 22 For such as blest are of the Lord, Inherite shall the land; But vnto all by Him accurst Destruction is at hand.23 The good man's steps the Lord directs, And pleaseth wel his way.24 His hand Hee gives, that iff hee fall, He fall not quite away. 25 I have been young, and now am ag'd; Yet did I never see The just deserted, or his seed Begge bread in miserie.26 He (alwayes mercifull,) to lend, His hand doth not recall. His children and posteritie Are in the blessing all. The fourth part. 27 Flee ill, do good; and ever dwell.28 For God doth judgment love; His saints Hee leaves not; kept they are For ever from above; But rooted out shall be the race29 Of wicked men. While they Who just are shall enjoy the land And dwell therin alway. 30 The just man's mouth shall wisdome vent, His tonge of judgement talks.31 The Law of God is in his hart, Hee slips not as he walks.32 The wicked waits the just to kill,33 But God doth never leave Him in his hand, nor him condemnes, While men doe judgement give. 34 Thy expectation on the Lord With patience do thow stay, Be not, (whatever thee befall,) Diverted from his way. He shall advaunce thee in the land, Inheritance to have, And when the wicked are cutt off, This shall thine eye perceive. The fyfth part. 35 The wicked, for his might much fear'd, Like to a lawrell green, Himself displaying in his pryd, Observ'd I haue and seen.36 But quicklie past hee from his place; Behold hee ceas'd to bee; I soght, but after search I found Of him no memorie. 37 The perfect man observe; the just Remark; his end is peace.38 But of transgressors jointlie shall Be ruined the race. The doolefull end of wicked men Destruction shall be.39 Whileas salvation of the Lord, Who righteous are shall see. Then in the day of sad distresse, To them he strength shall give.40 The Lord with help is still at hand, Them readie to releave. Releeve them from the violence Of wicked men Hee will; Hee save them shall, for that on him Their trust repose they still. XXXVIII. 1 Me to rebuike forbeare, O Lord; While kindled is thine ire; Nor chasten me, while flowing is Thy wrath's consumeing fire.2 For in me fast thine arows stick, Thy hand doth presse me sore.3 Becaus thow greev'd art, in my flesh No soundnes is therfore. 4 My sins of peace my bones depryve; For my iniquities, Gone o're my head, vnto a weight Above my strength arise.5 My wounds doe stink and are corrupt, For foolish I have been;6 Sore troubled and brought verie low, I sad all day am seen. 7 My loines are full of loathsomnes; My flesh is all vnsound.8 I feeble am and brocken sore, My greevs I cannot bound; Roare forth I must, my heart's so mov'd.9 Thow my desires dost see; O Lord, my groans, my secreet sighs Are manifest to thee. 10 My heart doth pant, my strength doth faile; Myne eyes have lost their light.11 My freends and lovers stand afar, My stroak doth them afright.12 My kinsmen prove vnkinde. Snairs layd By them my life who seek, Who wish in heart my hurt, of me Most wicked things do speak, 13 Deceits, all day they do devise, But I as deaf appeare; As one that dumbe is; who his mouth To open doth forbeare.15 Like one that heard not, from whose lips Do no reproofs proceed, I keep me close, and wait for Thee, Lord, in this time of need. 16 Thow wilt mak ansuer, Lord my God: I say'd. Oh heare my cry! Lest they rejoyceing over me, Themselvs do magnify; When they perceive my foot to slip,17 For I to halt ame prone; But sadlie sorowing, day and night To thee I mak my moane. 18 To thee my hid iniquitie, O Lord, do I declare. And for my sin with heavie hart Still am I takeing care.19 But livelie are my foes and strong, And who, with causles hate, Me most vnjustlie doe persue, Do prosper and grow great. 20 Yea, they who render ill for good, Mine adversaries prove; Becaus I evill doe declyne, And what is good do love.21 Forsake me not, O Lord my God, Be not far off from me.22 Make hast to help me, Lord; I have No saiftie but in thee. XXXIX. 1 I said I would watch o'r my wayes, Leist si?e escapt my tongue: I bridle would my mouth, whill I The wicked was among.2 Dumbe was I and did silence keep, Evin to speake good did spare, Till my restrained sorow stir'd, The stronger did appeare. 3 My hart within me brunt, the fire Shutt vp, at lenth furth brack; And, way wnto my museings made, Thus with my tong I spak:4 My end to know, me make O Lord, What is my dayes' extent; O make me know how fraile I am, And little permanent. 5 Lo! as an handbredth hast thow made The measure of my dayes; And, in thy sight, my life's whole age As it wer nothing, stays. Man verily, evin of all men, The meanest and most great, Are altogether vanity, In their best setled state. 6 Man, (surelie,) in a vain show walks; Sure vex'd they are in vain, To heap vp goods, (wncertaine who Shal brook them,) taking payne.7 And now, what wait I for, O Lord? My hope thow art. Me free8 From all my faults, from the reproach Of such as foolisch bee. 9 Becaus thow didst it I am dumbe, No word will I presume.10 Thy stroake O turne away; Thy hand's Sore strips my life consume;11 For sin, correcting with rebooks Wretcht man, thow wearst away His beautie, moth like; sure each man, Is vanity each way. 12 My prayer hear, hear, Lord, my cry. My flowing tears to sie, Do thow not silence keep, for I A stranger am with thee. Heer, as my fathers all, I stray; Turne, turne thy wraith from me; That I may take my breath before I goe and cease to bee. XL. 1 With patience wayting on the Lord, His time I did attend. He bowd Him doun and heard my cry, And pul'd me vp in end;2 Plung'd in a pitt, where tumbling floods With hideous horror roard, And sinking in the myrie clay, Me to my feett restor'd, Me on a Rock Hee rays'd and stay'd My steps, that walk abrod3 I might. Yea, with a new song fil'd My mouth, praise to our God. To many this shall manifest Be made, who Him shall feare, And confidently to the Lord, In danger, shall draw neare. 4 Blest is the man who maks the Lord His trust! hee in whose eyes The proud have no respect, nor such As turne aside to lies.5 O many, many, (Lord my God!) Thy works which wondrous are, Thy thoghts to us-ward hast thow made; They passe all reckoning far. Who can attaine to lay them out, In order vnto thee? To reckon or relate them wer A task too great for me.6 Not sacrifice nor offrings broght, Didst ansuer thy desire. Mine ears Thow pierc'd; sin offrings none, None brunt didst Thow require. 7 Then say'd I, Lo I come, O Lord, 'Tis writtin doune of me,8 In volume of the book. To doe Thy will, my joy sall be, My God: thy law is in mine hart. In the assemblie great9 I spak, and did the tydings glade, Of righteousnes, relate; Lo, I my lips refrain'd not, Lord,10 Thow knowst. Thy righteousnes, Not hid? in my hart, I haue Declaird thy faithfullnes And thy salvation; thy kinde love And treuth, by thee reveald, I from the congregation great Have not kept vp conceild. 11 Thy tender mercies do thow not, O Lord, withhold from me. Continowally let thy kind love And truth my saifty be.12 For I with evills on all sids, (More then can weell be told,) Am compast. My iniquities Have on me taken hold, That to look vp strength none remains; My hairs ar but a few With them compaird; that to mine heart Then faintnes doth ensue.13 Be pleasd, O Lord, me to rescue; Do not thine ayde delay,14 And such to shame and ruine bring, As seek my soule to slay. Let them, (turnd backward,) blush, who joy At my calamitie.15 Sad desolation the reward Of their disgrace let bee, Who over me insult with words Of scorne and proud disdain;16 But them that seek thee let rejoyce, And glad in thee remaine. The Lord be magnifyd: the voice Let be of every one, Continowally, who lovers are Of thy salvation.17 But poore and neidie I, yet lay'th The Lord my call to heart. My God, O stay not, Thow my help And my deliuerer art. XLI. 1 O blest is hee who wiselie doth Considder of the poore; Deliuered by the Lord, hee shall In trouble be secure.2 The Lord will his preserver bee, And of his life tak cair; Blest shall hee be, vpon the earth Weell with him shall it fair; Him to his foes thow wilt not leave.3 With sorrow when o'rsett, Cast on his couch, hee from the Lord Refreshing strength shall gett; When sick thow all his bed shalt make.4 Thy mercie, Lord, I craue. O heal my soule, I said, for I Against thee sinned have. 5 Of me my foes do evill speeke: When shall hee dye, (say they,) When perrisch shall his memorie, And name be worne away?6 A visite if hee come to make, His words are false and vain. Iniquitie his hart stors wp, And, (gone,) hee speaketh plaine. 7 Togither 'gainst me whisper all Who me at hatred beare; Against me evill they devise, And, (where they can gett eare,)8 Some plague, say they, to him cleavs fast, In that hee bedfast lyes; Hee nevir shall, recovered hence, Any more arise. 9 Even hee, whose freendschip I held firme, And, (trusted w? my minde,) Fed with my bredd, hath 'gainst me lift The heell, and prov'd vnkind.10 But show thow mercie, Lord; me raise, That I may them repay.11 For that my foes proud triumphes cease, That know thy love I may. 12 Thow me in my integritie Maintainst, yea, (of thy grace,) Giust me for evir to enjoy The comfort of thy face.13 From evirlasting let the Lord's High prayses be exprest, Till evirlasting, evin the God Of Israell be blest. Amen, Amen. Heir ends the first book of Psalmes. THE SECOUND BOOK OF PSALMES. XLII. 1 As after cooleing streams the hinde Doth pant with passion strong, My soule with vehement desire, For thee, O Lord, doth long.2 My soule thrists ardentlie for God, Thrists for the living God. When shall I come? O when appeare In place of his aboade? 3 Tears feed me day and night, for still, Where is thy God? say they. How can I but my heavie soule Poure out within me ay?4 Remembring, to the House of God I midst the presse repair'd, A preasse, with voyce of joy and prayse, Which solemne feasts prepard. 5 Why art thow, (O my soule,) cast doun? Within me greatlie mov'd? Wayt still on God; Him yet I'le prayse, His face my health hath prov'd.6 My God, my soule is sore cast doun, While I from Jordan's playn, From Hermon and the lesser hills, Thee mindeing, mourne in vaine. 7 As roareing of thy water spouts, Deep vnto deep doth call. Thy tumbling billowes, waltering waves, Gone over me are all.8 Yet God his mercie will command By day: His song by night Shall me refresh: To Him I'le pray, Of life who gave me right. 9 I to the Lord, my Rock, will say, Why hast thow me forgott? Why walk I sad becaus of foes Which my oppression plot?10 As murdring weapons in my bones, My foes reproaches are; While, daylie, me in pryde to ask: Where is thy God? they dare. 11 Why droupst thow, O dejected soule? Depriv'st thy self of rest? Sore greev'd and mov'd, tumultuouslie Why stirrst thow in my breast? Wayt, wayt on God: for yet will I Insist to spread his prayse; The health of my sad countenance, My God Hee is alwayes. XLIII. 1 Be Thow my judge, Lord, plead my cause; A nation mercilesse My pairtie is: Me from the man Of fraud and wickedness2 Sett free, for of my strentgh the God Thow art; why, thrust from thee, Why goe I mourning all the day, My foes oppressing me? 3 O send thow out thy light and truth; Let them direct my way, And bring me to thine holie hill, The places of thy stay.4 I'le to God's altar come, (to God, My joy and gladnes great,) And on the harp, (O God, my God,) Thy prayses celebrate. 5 My soule, why droop'st thow? why within Me mov'd? For God, O stay, My God, and countenance's health, To him yet prayse I'le pay. XLIV. 1 Wee with our ears haue heard, O God, Our fathers haue ws told What great things in their dayes thou didst, In ancient tymes of old.2 How them thow planted by thine hand, The heathens quite cast out; How thow the people didst afflict, And them madst spring and sprout. 3 For, by their oune suord, to enjoy The land attaind they not; Nor by the strength of their own arme, Salvation they gott. But thy right hand it was, thine arme, And countenance's light, This broght to passe, by reasoun they Found favour in thy sight. 4 Tis thow, O God, who art my king: Deliverance co?and5 For Jacob. With the horne through thee, Who to distresse ws stand Push doun wee shall: evin through thy name, Tread wnder foot shall wee All such as risen wp for war, Our foes are Shall in MS. found to be. 6 For in my bow I will not trust, Nor saftie in my sword7 Will I repose. Tis thow hast sav'd Ws from our foes, (O Lord); Thow hast our haters putt to shame.8 Our glory all the day Shal be in God; yea, to thy name Prayse wee will ever pay. 9 But, (ah,) now dost thow cast ws off, And bringst on ws disgrace; Thow with our airmies gost not forth, Whence foes we dare not face.10 Our haters ws at pleasure spoyle, While wee before them flie;11 Like sheep for meit givin o're, dispersd, We mongst the nations bee. 12 Thow sell'st thy people at no price, And thus not richer art.13 Wnto our neighbours a reproach, Expos'd in evrie part; Who duell about ws, with proud scoffs, With scorne, do ws invade;14 A byword to the heathen groune, The peoples' mockage made. 15 All day mine ignominy is Before me; shame of face16 Hath covered me becaus of those Who load me with disgrace; Who taunts vnto my troubles adde; By reasoun of the foe17 And self-avenger. Lord, all this To ws from thee doth flow, Yet thee forgottin have wee not, Not dealt deceatfully18 Have in thy covenant. Our hearts From turning back are free; Our steps depairt not from thy pathes;19 Tho' bruis'd ws sore thow hast, And, (cov'red with the shade of death,) In deeps mid'st dragons plac't. 20 Should wee forgett our God's great name, Our hands to strange gods rayse;21 This would not Hee search out, the heart's Hid secrets who surveyes?22 Yea, kild for thee wee are all day, Are held as slaughter[d] sheep.23 Stir wp thy self for ws, O Lord, What time is now to sleep? Ryse, cast ws not for ever off.24 Thy face why dost thow hide? That greeved and opprest we are, Why owt of minde let slide?25 To dust our soul's bow'd doun; to earth Our bellie fast doth cleaue.26 Rise, for our help, redeeme ws, (Lord,) Of mercie ws releeue. XLV. Inscript. For Korath's sons this song of Loves A solid meane for knowledge proves. 1 Great thoughts for matter hath my hart Digested; I do sing A work of weightie argument, A poeme to the king. My tonge is, (for enditeing prompt,) As speedie writer's pen.2 In beautie much more excellent Thow art then sonns of men. Grace in thy lips diffused is; For ever therfor blest3 Of God thow art. Gird on thy thigh Thy sword, thow Mightiest,4 Thy glorie and thy majestie. In majestie O ride Most prosperouslie, for that the raines Truth, meeknes, justice guide. 5 Thy right hand terrors shall thee teach. Thy shaftis their wings shall steep In hearts of the king's enemies, And low the people keep.6 Thy throne eternall is, (O God); With equitie thow sweyes7 Thy scepter. Righteousnes thow lovst, And hatst all wicked wayes. God therfor, evin thy God, the oyle Of Gladnes on thy head, Aboundantlie, above thy mates, Hath, (not by measure,) shed.8 Thy roabs of myrrhe, of aloes all, And cassia sweetlie smell, From Ivorie palaces, and theirs That mak the glad excell. 9 Amongst thy weemen, honored most By thee, kings' daughters stand. The Queen, in Gold of Ophir clad, Taks place at thy richt hand.10 Advert and weigh, thine eare encline, O Daughter; whollie sett Thyselff, thy freends, thy father's house, Thy people to forgett. 11 Thus, in thy beautie shall the king Exceedinglie delight. Thy Lord he is, to Him bow down, His honour is by right.12 The daughter of renowned Tyre; Of people not a few, Who mightie are, with presents rich, Shall for thy favor sue. 13 All glorie inwardlie arrayes The daughter of the king; Roabs wrought on grounds of gold, around Her decentlie do hing.14 In rare embroideries, to the king Shee shall be led along; (Her follow virgins after,) Shee To thee shall lead the throng. 15 They with rejoiceing shall bee brought, With mirth and gladnes great, And, in the palace of the king, Shall be receavd with state.16 Thy fruitfull ofspring shall the rooms Of sleeping fathers fill, In all the earth who shall derive From Thee dominion still. 17 My song to all succeeding times Thy name shall famous make; For ever, (therefore,) people shall Thy praise for subject take. XLVI. 1 God is our refuge and our strength, A verie present ayde2 In trouble. Thence thogh from its place Earth should be quite convey'd;3 Midst seas though hills wer hurld; thogh floods Should roare, and rage, and shake The mountains with their swelling might, No feare need wee to take. 4 A river is whose streams make glad The citie of our God, The sanctuarie of the Most High, The place of his aboade.5 God doth in midst of her remaine, Shee never mov'd shall bee. God shall her opportunelie ayde, In her necessitie. 6 The nations made a noise, sore mov'd The kingdoms did appeare. The Lord did giue his voyce, the earth Did melt, dismay'd with feare.7 On our syde is the Lord of Hosts, Our strength is Jacob's God.8 Come, view his workes, what solitude Hee maks on earth abrode. 9 To earth's far ends Hee wars maks cease, And breaks the archer's bow. The spear hee cutts, and in the flams The chariot wheels doth throw.10 Let men be still and stoup. Let all Know I am God, am Hee, Amongst the heathen nations, Who will exalted be. 11 Throughout earth's kingdoms all will I Exalted be abrode. On our side is the Lord of Hosts; Our strength is Jacob's God. XLVII. 1 Clap hands, (yee people all,) to God With voice of triumph shoute;2 For dreadfull is the Lord most high, A mightie king, throughout3 All earth he raignes. The people shall Hee vnder ws subdu; And nations vnder foot to bring, With strenth shall ws endu. 4 Of a most rich inheritance, (The high excellencie Of Jacob, whom hee dearlie lovd,) Made choise for ws hath hee.5 God is ascended with a shoute, The Lord with trumpetts sound.6 Sing praise to God, sing praise; Our King Let all be praysing found. 7 Sing, sing his praise; for God of all The earth is Lord and King. High prayses to his holy name, With vnderstanding sing.8 The Gentils God subjected hath To his dominion. Evin God, established, doth sitt Vpon his holie throne. 9 Togither ar the princes come, Who do the people lead, The people of the mightie God Of Abraham and his seed. For vnto God the sheelds of all The earth belong alone. Exceedinglie exalted is This high and holie one. XLVIII. 1 Great is the Lord, and greatly all Engaidg't are in his prayse, In citty of our God, his hill, Which holines arayes.2 For situation beautifull, The joy of all the land Mount Sion's; on her north side doth The great king's citie stand. 3 God for a refuge in her forts Is knowne; for Lo, kings4 Mett and did jointlie march. They looke, From looking wonder springs.5 There, troubled sore, they frighted fled;6 Them trembling did o'retake And payne, lik hers, through labour sore, Who is in birth brought weak. 7 Thow Tarshish shippeing from the east With tempest breckst outright.8 What by report we hard before, Confirm'd is now by sight, In citie of the Lord of Hosts, The citie of our God; For ever w?? establish sure Sall God, for his aboade. 9 Thy mercy midst thy temple, Lord, We silent did attend.10 Such as thy name, thy praise is heard, Wnto the world's far end.11 Thy right hand's full of righteousnes. Rejoyce let Sion's hill; Becaus of thy just judgements, Joy let Judah's daughtirs fill. 12 Walk Sion's walls about, around Her go, her tours all tell.13 Her bulwarks marke, her buildings strong, View and considder weell;14 Her Glorie to succeiding times To shew. For our God still Is this God; till our dying day Hee safely guide ws will. XLIX. 1 Hear this, all people, and giue eare, All in the world who duell,2 Both high and low; alike yee poore, And yee whose riches swell.3 My mouth of wisdome shall discourse, My heart of knowledge muse;4 And to apply mine eare vnto A parable I'le choose. 5 My doubtfull argument vpon The harp I will unfold. Why, in the dayes of evill, should Wpon me feare tak hold, While I on everie syd besett Am with iniquitie, W?? doth me, at my very heels, Persue wncessantlie? 6 Of these that in their wealth do trust, Proud while ther riches ryse,7 Not one a brother can redeeme, God doth such pryce despise;8 For deare ther soul's redemption is, And ceaseth such to be;9 As thus hee should for ever live, And not corruption sie. 10 For he beholds the wise to die, The foole and brutish one To perish; and that others spend Their goods when they are gone.11 Yet think they that establisht still, Ther houses shall endure; And, from posteritie, applause Their buildings shall procuir. 12 There lands by ther oune names they call. Man, not the lesse, to day Advanc'd to hono?, like to beasts That perrish, frosts away.13 This way of theirs their foolishnes Maks more then manifest. Their sayings yet their seed approve, And much wpon them rest. 14 In grave, like sheep, they shal be lay'd, (A flock for death to feed); And over them the just, when as The morning beams shall spread, Shall haue dominion. Then their strenth In grave shal waist away; Their duelling places of delight Constrain'd to chainge for clay. 15 But, from dominion of the grave, God shal my soule sett frie;16 For me receaue hee shall. O fear Not, one made rich to sie, The glory of his hous encreast;17 For nothing at his end Shall hee tak hence, nor after him His hono? shal discend. 18 Though, (whiles alive) his soule hee blest; Thogh, thyself cherishing,19 Men prayse; with fathers yett to lodge, Wher nevir light shall spring,20 Remove hee must. Who prudent are Not, and in honour bee, Ar like to beasts, of reasoun voyd, Which perrisch vtterlie. L. 1 The mightie God, Jehouah, spake, And earth from end to end Cald; from the riseing of the Sun, Till where hee doth discend.2 God out of Sion shyn'd, where seen Is beautie most compleet.3 Our God shall come and not be still; Before Him flams shall eate. Around Him shall a Tempest rage.4 To heavens, Hee from above Shall call, and to the earth, that Hee His people's Judge may prove.5 My saints assemble, who with me, By offring, league did make.6 Heavens shall his Justice shew, for God, To judge, the throne shall take. 7 Hear, O my people, I will speak; O Israel, give thow eare. God, even thy God, I am: against Thee witnes I will beare.8 Not for vnfrequent sacrifice My challenge is to thee; For thy brunt offrings have before Me been continuallie. 9 No bullock from thine house I'le have, No male goat from thy fold;10 For beasts that woods and thousand hills Bring forth, of me do hold.11 The mountaine foule I know; the feeld No wild-beast doth frequent,12 Which I co?and not; wold I thee, If food I lackt, acquent? Mine is the world, the plentie mine, That filleth everie part.13 Vpon the flesh of Bulls, or blood Of Goats sett I my hart?14 Such eat or drink will I? To God Let praise thy offring bee; And let thy promis'd vowes be pay'd To Him who is most High. 15 Call thow vpon me in the day Of thy Calamitie. Deliver thee I will: my name So shalt thow glorifie.16 But O thow wicked one, sayth God, Darst thow my lawes declair? My Couenant tak in thy mouth As warranted thow wer? 17 Thow, who instruction hatst, my words Of no availe dost make;18 Runs't with the theef, when seen, and with Adult'rers dost partake;19 Thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue Who givst deceit to frame;20 Against thy brother speaks, and dost Thy mother's sonne defame. 21 In these thow stick'st not to transgresse, Yet silence kept I have; Me therfor like vnto thyself, Thow surelie didst conceave. But thee rebuike I will, at length, And bring thy si?s to light, And sett them, (vylie as they are,) In order in thy sight. 22 This lay to hart, (now) yee who God Forgett, least yow I teare In peeces, and there none be found, Yow to deliver, neare.23 Who offer praise do honour me; And who aright dispose Their way, the Lord's salvation To such will I disclose. LI. inscript. Thus David, after hee went in To Bathsheba, convinc'd of sin By Nathan propheet of the Lord, His guilt and greef leaves on record. 1 As great in love, as kinde thow art, O God, on me compassion take; Thy mercies, not mine owne desert, A ground for my requeest I make: As these exceed, my faults not few2 Blot out. Lord, throughlie purge thow me From my iniquitie; made new And cleane, me from my sin sett free. 3 O cleanse me, for my guiltines I do acknowledge to be great. My sin, (my secret wickednes,) Before my face is ayre and late.4 'Gainst Thee, Thee onlie have I sin'd; I guiltie in thy sight appeare, That men for ever Thee may fynd In speaking just, in judgeing cleare. 5 Lo, in iniquitie forth broght, My mother me conceav'd in sin.6 Lo, inward truth Thow lovst, and taught Me wisdome of the hart within. 7 Purge, purge with hysope my offence, That cleane and pure I may appeare. O wash me, that for ever hence The snow my whytnes come no neare. 8 Joy make me heare and gladnes, so The bones Thow bruisd refresh'd shall be.9 Hide from my faults thy face; let no Spot vnpurg'd out remaine in me.10 A cleane hart let created be In me, renew'd a spirit right.11 Cast me not off; nor quench in me, O God, thy holie spirit's light. 12 Thy saveing joy to me restore. With thy free spirit me sustaine.13 I'le teach thy wayes, that such before As went astray may turne againe.14 From guilt of blood, O God, (the God Of my salvation,) set me free. To spread thy righteousnes abroade, Thus sett on work my tonge shall be. 15 Lord, open thow my lips, so shall My mouth aloud thy praises sound.16 For sacrifice if thow didst call, Mine on thine altar had been found. No offrings which the flams prepare17 Thow carst for. Spirits bruisd that be Of God the sacrifices are; No broken hart's despis'd by thee. No hart contrite dost Thow contemne,18 O God. To Sion, of thy love, Shew favour. Thy Jerusalem Raise, of her walls the builder prove. 19 Offrings of Righteousnes receave, Brunt offrings, shalt Thow then, O God; Then whole brunt offrings shall they leave, And with fat calves thine altars load. C. [Loud shouts of joy let all the earth] 1 Loud shouts of joy let all the earth Vnto the Lord expresse.2 The Lord with gladnes serve, to him With songs mak your addresse.3 Know that Jehovah he is God: He made us, and not we Our selfes; his people and the scheip Wee of his pasture bee. 4 Enter his gates with giveing thanks. Prayse in his courts proclame. With thanks for ever celebrate And blesse his holy name.5 For good is God eternally; His mercy's firme and sure; His treuth to generatiounes all For ever do endure. CI. 1 Mercy and Judgment I will sing, I'le sing, O Lord, to thee;2 And in a perfyte way will keep The path of prudencie. Thy presence when shall I enjoy? I'le walk w? vpright hart.3 Within myne house all wickednes Shall from my presence part. I hate ther work who turne aside, To me it shall not cleave.4 The part perversely that disposd Is, may at me tak leave.5 I'le know no wicked persoun, such As privily employ Their tongs, ther nighbours to traduce, I'le vtterly destroy. A proud high look, a haughty hart Who haue, such I depise.6 On them who faithfull in the land Ar found, I'le sett myne eyes, That they w? me may duell; the man Who keips ane vpright way, Is he whom for a servant chuise I will, with me to stay. 7 No residence within myne house For such as work deceat; Not one establisht in my sight Shall stand, who lyes relate.8 Betimes the leude ones of the land Shall be cutt off by me; That of all wicked workers thus, God's citty purg'd may bee. CII. A prayer for the soule distrest, When, with affliction's weght opprest, To God it poureth furth (apart) The inward angwisch of the hart. 1 My prayer heare, O Lord. Lett my complaint haue place.2 From me in day of my distresse, O do not hyde thy face. Giue eare when I do call; To answer mak no stay;3 For, (as ane hearth my bones brunt vp,) As smoak my dayes decay. 4 Sore smitten is my hart, Yea withred as the grasse; That to refresch my lyff with food, I (carelesse) overpasse.5 By reason of my groans, Whose noise no respett gives, Fast to my skin, (w? dolor dryed,) My bones full closse do cleave. 6 Most lyk a pelican, In places waist I prove; Or, as ane owle, whose dreirie moanes The deserts wild do move.7 I lyk a sparow watch, No myrth which doth admitt, But, playning on the houses' top, Doth solitarie sitt. 8 By foes reproaching tongs, I all the day ame torne; Who gainst me have let louse ther rage, My overthrow have sworn.9 As bread I ashes eate; My drink I mixed with tears;10 Becaus in furie thow dost frowne, And all enflamd appears. Thy hand on high me raisd; Thy hand me low hath layd.11 Most lyk a shade my dayes decline; Lyk grasse cutt doun I fade.12 Bot thow, O Lord, the same Continew shalt for ay; To generations all, (ay fresch,) Shal thy remembrance stay. 13 Thow surelie shalt arise, And pitie Sion's case; For now the time, the sett tym's come, To her to turne thy face.14 Thy servants in her stones, (Thogh scattired) tak delight; Her trampled dust and ruins find Compassion in ther sight. 15 So heathens shal thy name, Earth's kings thy glorie fear.16 When God shall Sion build, hee shall In glorie bright appear.17 The destitut's desire With him shal fynd respect; Their prayer hee will not despise, Nor them in neid neglect; 18 For after ages this Shall kept be in record, And they that shall created be Shall blesse and laude the Lord.19 For hee hath looked doun From his high sanctuarie; The Lord from heaven vpon the earth Hath cast his gracious eye; 20 Of such as be in bonds, The heavie groans to heare; And to sett free those that to death, (As destinate,) ar neare;21 In Sion thus to show Jehovah's holie name; And in Jerusalem aloud, His prayses to proclame. 22 Evin then, when congregate Togither, shal be seen The people, when to serve the Lord The kingdomes shall conveen.23 (My dayes abridgt,) my strength Hee weakned in the way.24 In midst of my swift dayes I say'd: Lord tak me not away. Beyond all tymes draune out, Thy years from chainge ar free.25 Earth's grounds of old thow laydst; the heavens, Thy workmanship they bee.26 They perish shall, but thow Continew shalt for ay. Yea, as a garment all of them Shall, (worne with age,) decay. Evin thow shalt work this chainge, As on a vesture weake;27 They chaing'd, but thow shalt still be hee Whose yeares no change partake.28 Thy servants' children shall Continew; and their seed Established before thy face For ever shal reside. CIII. 1 Blesse God, my soule; his holie name Blesse, all that is in me.2 Blesse God, my soule; his bountyes all Forgott let never bee:3 Who frielie all thy faults forgiues, All thy diseases cures;4 And from destruction sad, thy lyfe's Redemption procuires; 5 With love, with pittie, thee who crouns; With good things who thy mouth Doth fill, that (as the eagles), so Renewed is thy youth.6 Justice and judgement doth the Lord For all that are opprest.7 His wayes to Moses, Hee his acts To Israell's so?es exprest. 8 Most gracious is the Lord, with him Compassion doth abound; To anger alwayes slow, and great In mercie Hee is found.9 Nor chyds Hee still, nor angrie ay, Hee gius our si?es ther due;10 Nor doth in ws, as wee deserve, Iniquitie persew. 11 For as, in wondrous hight, the heavens Ar rays'd the earth above; As wondrous great, all they that fear Him do his mercies prove.12 As farre as east and furdest west Disjoyned by distance are, All our iniquities, from ws Hath Hee remov'd as far. 13 As to ther children is the kinde Respect that parents beare, As tender-hearted is the Lord To all that doe him feare.14 Hee knowes our frame, &amp; myndfull is Our matter is but dust;15 That man his dayes are as the grasse, Which soone evanish must. Hee floorisheth as doth a floure In field, which strecht doth fall,16 By blasting wynds made not to bee, And fill no place at all.17 But vnto all eternitie, For euer firme and fast, The tender mercie of the Lord, To all that fear him, last. 18 His righteousnes from race to race, All such extends vnto His covenant who keep, and minde His precepts, them to do.19 His throne the Lord in Heavens hath fixd; His kingdome all co?ands.20 Blesse him, his angells, yee whose strength No creatur's strenth withstands. 21 Yee, (hearkening to his voice and word,) Who to his will mak way, O blesse the Lord; his ministers, His hosts which him obey.22 In evrie place of his empire, To what hee doth afford To bee, or move, lett all him blesse. My soule, O blesse the Lord. CIV. 1 Blesse God, my soule! O God, my God, How great dost thow appeare; Glorie and highest honour are The roabs which thow dost weare.2 As with a garment who thyself Environ'd hast with light; Whose hands the heavens haue streacht about Thee, like a curtain bright. 3 The beames of all his high-raisd roumes Who layd in deeps aboue; Clouds made his chariot, winging winds, (Thus mounted,) who doth move.4 His angells sp'rits, his ministers Who made a fyrie flame;5 And earth, that stable it might stand, On bases firme did frame. 6 Most lyk a rayment, with the deep Thow cov'redst it around; Waters (envolving all) the tops Of highest mountaines round.7 But thow no sooner didst rebuik, Then all, (with gushing noise,) Wer put to flight; all haisted have, At thy loud thundring voyce. 8 They vpwards by the mountains move; By valleys low discend; And for the place which thow didst found, For ther aboad, do bend.9 To them thow didst assigne a bound, Within the which to byde, That they should nevir more returne, Earth's flourie face to hyd. 10 Plains hee with springs provyds, which way Betwein the mountains make;11 Beasts of the feeld heer drinke, and here Ther thrist wild asses slaike.12 By them the feathred flocks of heaven Themselvs do place by payrs, And heer (securelie) midst the boughes, Sitt warbling forth sweett ayres. 13 Hills, from his courts above, to baith, Hee moisture doth prepare. Fild with the fruict of thy rare works, The earth is evrie where.14 For cattell grasse, herb for the vse Of man, hee maks to grow; And causeth earth's cold bosome food Aboundantlie bestow. 15 Hence wine to cheare the heart, and oyle To clear the face, hee brings; Hence bread, whose strenth the life sustaines, At his appointment springs.16 The trees of the Almightie full Of sap and strenth do stand; Mount Libanus' tal cedars, which Hee planted with his hand. 17 Birds (heer) do build ther nests; the Storke In firrs aloft doth lodge.18 Steep hills to goats, to coneyes smal The rocks ar a refuge.19 The lesser light, the moone, he made Apointed tyms to show; The su?e, when time is to breck off His daylie taske, doth know. 20 Thow darknes calst, 'tis night; in it From woods breck forth abrode21 Wild beasts. Prey-roareing lyons seek Ther sustenance from God;22 But, gathred in their de?s do lurk, Dayes torch whill thow dost light.23 Man to his industry retourns, And plies his work till night. 24 How many ar thy works, O Lord, All wrought in wisdom rare? Fild with thy riches infinite The earth is everie where.25 So this great sea is, whose vast arms, Stretcht out on evrie syd, Of creeping creaturs numberlesse, Sorts great and small do hyd. 26 Heer doe the ships make way; heere strayes The leviathan hudge, By thee which form'd, heerin to play, This element doth lodge.27 All wayt on thee, in seasoun due That thow mayst furnisch food.28 Thou giust, they gathir; all, thy hand, Sprede forth, doth fill with good. 29 Thow hidst thy face, how suddenlie Doth trouble on them fall. Their spirit thow calst back, they dye, And turnd in dust are all.30 Thy spirit thow sends furth, and hence A new creation springes. Thus thow to earth's sad face, (refresh'd), New lyff and beautie bringes. 31 God's glorie still may last; may still His works his joy provock.32 On earth hee looks, its center shakes; Hee toucheth hills they smoake.33 Whill, (adding dayes,) my life hee lenths, Of him my song shal bee; Whill beeing thow bestow'st, my God, I'le still be prayseing thee. 34 My thoghts of him shall be most sweett; My joy in God I'le place.35 Lett sinners, from the earth cutt off, No more defyle her face. O, that the wicked, (quite consum'd,) Hence nevir more might spring! Blesse thow the Lord, my soule! Let all The Lord's high prayses sing. CV 1 Praise God, O call vpon his name; The people with his actes acquent.2 Sing vnto him, in psalmes proclaime His prayse; his wondrous works all vent.3 His holy name let alwayes bee Your glory. Glade in hart be they4 Who seek the Lord. The Lord seek yee; O seek his strenth and face for ay. 5 The works miraculouslie wrought, Prodigious wonders of each kinde, The judgements of his mouth, all broght To passe by him, still beare in minde, 6 Seed of his servant Abraham, His Choisen Ones, yee Jacob's race.7 Our God Jehouah is by name; His judgements in all earth haue place. 8 Hee keeps in minde his couenant For ay, his word and promise fast, The which hee did command and grant To thousands of degrees to last;9 His league with Abram made, which hee By oath to Isaake ratifyde;10 To Jacob stablisht by decree, To Israel firme for ay to byd. 11 Canaan's pleasant soyle, (said Hee,) That fruitfull land, I will mak thine, Of your inheritance to bee The proper lote, layd off by line.12 In number few, evin verie few, And forraineuers when there they stayed; When as, (encountring straits anew,) From nation they to nation strayed, When from one kingdome they did flitt, And other parts and people prov'd,14 To wrong them hee did none permitt, Yea, kings hee for their sakes reprov'd.15 Take heed, (sayd hee) lest violence To mine anointed offred be; Sie, yee to them give no offence; Vnharm'd, my propheits lett passe free. 16 He famine cald, to which hee gaue The land; evin bracke the staffe of breade;17 And Joseph sent, (thogh sold a slave,) A man of place, them to preceid; 18 Whose feet, sore payn'd with bolts of brasse, In irons made fast, they made him lye;19 Till that his word did come to passe; The Lord did by his word him try. 20 The king, the peopl's ruler, sent To lowse his bands, and him inlairge.21 Instead of strict imprissonment, Of all his house hee gaue him charge; Lord therof, yea, of all hee hade22 He ruler made him; to his will To ty his; that wiser made His elders might be, by his skill. 23 Israell also, full of years, To Egypt from Canaan came. Old Jacob, fred of all his fears, Did sojourne in the land of Chame.24 The Lord his people every way, There, did exceidinglie increase, And soone them mightier made then they Who did themselves their foes professe. 25 With hate his people to persew, Their wicked harts hee did enclyne; His servants, as their number grew, By subtilty to vndermine.26 His servant Moses Hee employ'd, Yea, Aaron chuis'd, amidst the crew27 Wher Chame discent ther lote enjoy'd; His signes and wonders (there) they shew. 28 Hee darknes sent, and darknes all Envolv'd; his word was not withstoode.29 Their streams turnd blood; both great and small The fish hee slew of everie flood.30 Their princes' rowmes of frogs not free, Of them the land brought forth such hosts;31 Hee spake, forth suarm'd each sort of flie; Yea, lyce did craule in all their costs. 32 Haill in ther land and fireflaughts flew, For nursing raine, which hee held back.33 Their vines and figtrees hee o'rethrew, And all ther border trees doun brack.34 He spake, and numberles wer found Locusts and cutwormes, to employ35 Of all the land and fertile ground, The herbe and fruit which did destroy. 36 The first borne all, of all ther land, Hee smote, the chieff of all ther strength.37 With gold and silver at command, His people hee brought furth at lenth. Mongst all the Tribs was none at all Found feeble, and vnfitt for flight.38 Egipt, in that their fear did fall On them, was glade at ther good-night. 39 By him a cloud was o're them cast. A fyre to cleare the night was given.40 They ask'd, hee brought them quails in haist, And fild them with the bread of heavin.41 The rock he opned, from whose veyns Hee made refreshing waters flow, Which, gliding through the parched playnes, Did soone a pleasant river grow. 42 For good his holie word hee made To Abraham, his servant deare;43 And brought his people forth most glade, His choisen ones, with shouting cheare.44 The peoples' paynes, the heathens' lands, For them to brooke hee did afford;45 His laws observe, and his co?ands That they might keep. O, praise the Lord. CVI. 1 Praise God. With thanks make your addresse; Hee's good, His mercie lasts for ay.2 His mightie acts who can expresse? Who all his praises can display?3 Blest they that judgement keep! Evin hee Who to do right doth stil hold deare! Lord, with that love remember me, Which to thy people thow dost beare. 4 Wowchaife, O Lord, to visite me With thy salvation, to the end That I the good and peace may sie,5 That still thy choisen do attend; That, with thy nation to rejoyce, All joy beside I may decline; And that I glorie may with those, Who by inheritance ar thine. 6 Wee, with our fathers, (Lord,) haue sind; Perverse and lewd our works haue been.7 Our fathers, at thy wonders blynd, Throughout all Egipt which wer seene, Them vnderstood not, nather kept Thy mercies' multitude in minde; But at the sea, the Red Sea, leapt All in rebellion and repind. 8 Yet, for his name's sake, them hee sav'd, His mightie powar to mak knowne.9 The Red Sea hee rebuik'd; bereav'd Of waves, it was dryed vp and gone. Through deeps, as desarts dry, hee led,10 And them from hater's hand rescu'd; Yea, them deliuered while they fled Before their foes, who them persew'd. 11 Seas covered ther oppressors proud, Not one of all was left aliue.12 His word beleeving then, aloud, In songs, they solemne prayse did giue.13 But soone they did his works forgett, And did not on his counsell wait;14 But, in the desart, lowsse did lett The rains to concupiscence great. They lusted, and did tempt the Lord, Whil through the wildernes they went.15 To their requeist hee did accord, But lea?esse in their soules hee sent.16 At Moses in the campe they grudgd, And thus gainst Aron did they si?,17 God's holy one. To death adjudg'd, Earth opning, Dathan did suck in. 18 Earth, (straight), Abiram's companie Did cover. Midst ther troups a fire Was kindled. For there mutinie, Midst flames the wicked did expire.19 A Calfe they made, a molten masse, In Horeb, worship eik imparted;20 And in ane oxe's forme, on grasse That feeds, their glory they converted. 21 Of God forgettfull they became, Who sav'd them whil to him they soght, In Egypt; in the land of chame,22 Things great and wonderfull who wroght, Evin fearfull things by the Red Sea:23 That, whil for their destruction bent, His choysen Moses, them to free, Did in the gape himselff present. Els (straight) persewing wraith surprisd Had all, thus if not turn'd aside.24 The pleasant land, yea, they despis'd, And did his holie word diffide.25 Yea, in their tents a murmureing band Them found hee, from his voice to be26 Averse; sua lifted vp his hand, That in the desart they should die; 27 Amongst the heathen overthroune, That fall and perish should their seed, And, dissipate in parts vnknowne, That they should roame about in need.28 To Baal-peor joynd, they eate The sacrifices of the dead.29 Thus, by their workes, (his furie great Provockt,) the plague did mongst them spread. 30 But judgement quicklie exequuted By Phyneas, the plague did stay;31 A work for righteousnes imputed To him, from age to age, for ay.32 Him, where the streams of strife did flow, They greev'd, with Moses for their sake33 That ill it went. There chaif'd they so His spirit that hee rashlie spake. 34 Nor all the rebell nations slew They, whom the Lord to death decern'd;35 But, (mingled mongst the heathen crew,) Their works (with greedinesse) they learn'd.36 They serv'd their idols, for a snare Which wer vnto them. Ill advis'd,37 Nor souns nor daughtirs they did spair; But vnto devils them sacrific'd. 38 Much sakeles blood they shed. The blood Of eyther sexe of ther owne seed They offred to the Idole broode Which did Canaan overspreed. The land with blood thus did they staine.39 To works most vyle, which made them, bent, And with their oune inventions vain, They wickedlie a whooreing went. 40 God's wrath thus 'gainst his people grew, That hee his heritage abhorr'd;41 And, suffring heathens them subdue, They ruld wer by their haters' word.42 By foes opprest, whil humbled so,43 Oft from their hand Hee sett them frie; But, with their counsell greev'd, them low Hee broght, for their iniquitie. 44 Yet lookt hee on them when, (confind With straits,) their cry came to his eare,45 And vnto them did call to minde The covenant which hee did sweare. Hee did repent him, as abound His mercies do, which bounds exceid;46 Yea, caused that they favo? found With all who them did captius lead. 47 Saue ws our God. Ws, Lord, reclaime From mongst the heathen. Fred by thee So shall wee laude thy holie name; So shall thy praise our glorie be.48 Blest be the Lord, both now and ay, The God of Israel, good alwayes. Amen, let all the people say. All joyntlie to the Lord give prayse. CVII. Begi?ing the 5 booke of the psalmes. 1 Giue thanks to God, for hee is good, His mercie lasts for ay.2 This the redeem'd ones of the Lord, (From foes sett free,) may say;3 From east, west, south and north, whom hee Did gather from all bounds,4 Whil wand'ring in the wildernes, Through waist and wayles grounds. 5 No citie found they where to duell; With thrist and hunger faint6 Their soules did fail. Then with their straits The Lord they did acquent.7 The Lord from their distresse them fred, And led them in the way, That thus sett right, they might fynd out A citty for their stay. 8 Oh, for the bountyes of the Lord That men wold thankfull prove; To prayse him, that his wondrous works The sonns of men wold move!9 For hee the thristie soule doth slaike, And satisfy at will; Yea, evin the soule with hunger faint, With goodnes hee doth fill. 10 Who duell in darknes, in death's shade, With Irnes and anguisch bound,11 Becaus against the word of God Rebellious they wer found;12 Yea, did the highest's counsell scorne, Hee therfor did bring low Their harts with labour. They fell doun Bot none did help bestow. 13 Then when with straits besett about, Vnto the Lord they cry, The Lord from their distresses all Releev'd them by and by.14 From darknes, from the shade of death, His hand them furth did take; And to their fetters offring force, Asunder them did shaike. 15 Oh, for the bounties of the Lord, That men wold thankfull prove; To praise him, that his wondrous works The sonns of men wold move!16 For Hee the gates of brasse most strong, Hath brust and brocken all; And, by his might, the barrs of irne Ar cut in peeces small. 17 For their transgressions, for their sins, Fooles ar afflicted sore.18 All food their souls abhorre; death's gates (Straight) are they brought before.19 To God then cry they in distresse, From straits hee setts them free;20 His word hee sends, and they, restored, Destruction's stroke do flee. 21 Oh, for the bountyes of the Lord, That men wold thankfull prove; To praise Him, that his wondrous works The sonns of men wold move!22 The sacrifice of sole?e thanks To God lett them present, And with rejoiceing heart, his works Of might and mercy vent. 23 They that in schipps do seas discend, And on proud wavs persew24 Their trade, God's works and wondrous acts, Amidst the deeps do view.25 Hee speeks, and streght tempestuous stormes Of wynds his word obey, Which swelling surges lift aloft, That none bot hee can lay. 26 To heavins heav'd vp, thence dive they doun, Discouering deeps profound; Their melting soules, amidst these straits, Wnwsuall fears confound.27 As one in drink, in stag'ring state, They totter to and fro, And to ther witt's end broght, no more Do skill nor courage show. 28 While straited thus in thes extreams, Wnto the Lord they cry; The Lord from their distresses all Releeus them by and by.29 The storme he calms and, (waves represt,) Sea's angrie face maks eavin,30 And brings them glade, (the tempest stild,) To their desyred heawen. 31 Oh, for the bounty of the Lord, That men wold thankfull prove; To praise Him, that his wondrous works The sonns of men wold moue!32 O, let them 'mongst the multitude Exalt his holy name; And, when the elders are conveen'd, His prayse aloud proclame. 33 Rivers a desart, water springs Dry land the Lord doth make;34 The fruitfull land a barrennesse, For leud possessors' sake.35 The wildirnes in standing lakes, Dry ground in water springs36 He turns, and (there) that they may duell, The hungrie hither brings. A duelling citie they prepare, More safelie where to live.37 The feilds they saw, and vine yairds plant, Which friuchfull encrease giue.38 Hee blesseth them, and multiply'd (Thus) ar they in excesse. Yea, for their cattell Hee doth care, That they do not decrease. 39 Againe diminished they are, And suddenlie brought low; Constrain'd to beare oppression, Calamitie and woe.40 Contempt Hee, at his pleasour, pours On pow'rs that scepters swey; And, in a wayles wildernes, Hee causeth them to stray. 41 Yet, from affliction Hee doth raise The poore, borne doun with neid; And, as a standing flock doth make Their families to spread.42 The man that righteousnes persews Shall thus, (rejoiceing,) sie; And all iniquity shall stop Her mouth, and silenc'd bee. 43 Who prudent is, who, (wiselie way'd,) To hart doth thes things lay, The loving kindnes of the Lord That wnderstand they may. CVIII. 1 My hart's prepar'd, O God! I'le sing And mak sweet melodie2 Evin with my glorie. Be awalk't My harp and psalterie!3 Myselfs I ayrelie will rowse vp, And, mongst the people, prayse; Yea, hymns amongst the nations, To Thee, O Lord, I'le rayse. 4 For great thy mercy's heavins above; Thy truth the clouds doth reach.5 To heavens be thow extold, O God; Thy glory, (passing speech,)6 Be over all the earth, that thy Belov'd may be sett free. Deliuer, Lord, by thy right hand, And daigne to ansuer me. 7 God by his holinesse, hath said (I joyfull will remaine,) That Schechem's spoyls I shall devide, And measure Succoth's playne.8 Mine Gilead is, Manasse's mine, And Ephraim of mine head The strenth's; my statuts and my lawes From Judah shall proceed. 9 Moab's my washing pott, my shoe O're Edom will I cast; And over Palestina proud Triumph I shall at last.10 Who will wnto the citty strong, To Edom, be my guide?11 Wilt thow not, Lord, from ws cast off, Who late thy face didst hide? 12 Wilt thow not with our hosts goe forth O God? To thee wee flee, To thee, for help in all our straits, For vain is man's supplie.13 By ws shall acts of worth be wroght, Through God, in whom wee trust. Evin Hee our adversaries all Shall trample in the dust. CIX. 1 God of my praise, let my complaint Thy patient silence marre;2 For wicked and deceatfull mouths Against me opned are.3 With lying tongs they me traduce, They compasse me around With words of malice, and persew Me, while no caus is found. 4 They for my favo? are my foes, But vnto thee I pray.5 They ill for good, my love vnfain'd With hatred do repay.6 Let ouer him the wicked rule, And at his right hand sett7 Be Sathan. Let him, (when adjudg't,) Doome with the guilty gett; 8 His prayer si?e; his days be few; His charge another take.9 Their mother soone a widow, may Their orphane children make.10 Still vaige, and sharke, and beg about, Their bounds lay'd waist, they may;11 To mercilesse extortioners, Lett all hee hath be prey. 12 His labour let the stranger spoyle, And none compassion shew; Vnto his children fatherles From none may favour flow.13 His ofspring, utterlie cutt off, May no more sprout nor spread; Let evin their names be blotted out, In ages to succeed. 14 His father's faults be ever fresch With God, nor wipt away15 His mother's sinne; before the Lord Let them be found for ay.16 The Lord their memorie from earth Root out, becaus hee shew No mercie, but the indigent and needie did persew; Yea, spaird not to the brocken heart The wounds of death to giue.17 To cursing as he was enclin'd, Let cursing to him cleaue: As blessing bred him no delight, No blessing be him neare.18 Let cursing cloath him as a suit Most fitt for him to weare; As water in his bowells may It sink; as oyle find place,19 Evin pearce his bones; bee't as a cloake, Or covering of disgrace,20 Or as a belt, continowally To gird himselff withall. This to my foes, that will speek Against my soule, befall; 21 From God be this their due. But thow, For glorie of thy name, Do, for me Lord, me to rescue, Let lousse thy mercye's streame.22 For good it is, O God, and I Afflicted am, and poore. Yea, deep and deadlie wounds my hart Within me doth endure. 23 Gone am I, a declining shade My cace doth clearlie show; As ye vnsettled grasse-hopper I tos'd am to and fro.24 My knees, through fasting, feeble are; My flesh of fatnes free;25 To them made a reproach, their heads They shake and gaize at me. 26 Help me, O Lord my God! O save Me, for thy mercie's sake.27 That this thy hand is and thy work, (Lord,) manifest it make.28 Curse they, so thow do blesse, O Lord; Confusion let them gain Against me who arise, but glade Thy servant let remain. 29 Disgrace my foes may cloath, their schame Them cover as a cloake.30 The Lord wncessantlie I'le prayse, My mouth shall him invoke;31 I'le prayse him midst the preasse, for Hee, The poore-man's right hand nigh, Him, from persute of such as wold Condemne his soule, setts free. CX. 1 The Lord say'd to my Lord, sitt doun, Place by my right hand take, Till I thine adversaries all For thee a foot stoole make.2 The scepter of thy strenth the Lord Shall out of Sion send. Rule thow amidst thine enemies, Thy Government extend. 3 In day of thy wnbounded pow're, When all thy foes shall flie, Thy people, voluntaries all, Shal flock and follow thee. In beauties of pure holinesse, As deaw in everie feeld, The morning's bellie shal thy youth Innumerable yeeld. 4 The Lord hath sworne and will him not Repent; eternallie A preist thow art, according to Melchisedeck's degree.5 The Lord, thy right hand alwayes nigh, When comes the dreadfull day Of his fierce wraith, shal kings cut off, In state who scepters swey. 6 Amongst the heathen hee shall judge; On them giue sentence out. Yea, hee, with lifelesse carcasses, Shall fill the bounds about.7 The heads of mightie countreyes shall Hee wound, and in the way Drink of the brooke, and therfor lift His head aloft for ay. CXI. 1 Prayse yee the Lord! My hart to prayse I whollie will applie. Him midst the preasse, evin where the saincts Assemble, prayse will I.2 Great are his acts, soght out of all That therein tak delight.3 Most glorious, most majestick all His works in all men's sight. 4 His righteousnes endures for ay. His wonders deep in minde To be lay'd vp hee maks. The Lord Most gracious is and kinde.5 Who feare him furnischt are with food, And from his hand do gett What neidfull is. His covenant Hee nevir doth forgett. 6 The powar of his actes hee hath Made to his people knowne, In giveing the inheritance Of heathens to his owne.7 Judgement and strenth his hands haue wrought. All his decries are sure;8 In vprightnesse and veritie Done, they for ay endure. 9 Redeem'd hee hath his people, firme His couenant to his For euer hee hath made: His name Holie and dreadfull is.10 First wisdome is to feare the Lord, And wisest are all they, That walk in his comandements. His prayse endurs for ay. CXII. 1 Sing Halelujah! Blest is hee Who doth Jehouah feare, To whom the Lord's commandements Exceedinglie ar deare.2 His seed shall mightie be on earth. The just man's progenie3 The Lord shall blesse, and in his house Shall wealth and riches bee. 4 His righteousnes endures for ay. To him ariseth light In darknes. Hee is gracious, Shewes mercy and doth right.5 A good man pitty doth expresse, And to the needfull lends; And caryes with discretion What ever hee intends. 6 Hee, (surelie,) nevir shal be mov'd. The wpright's memorie7 No tyme shall bound. Hee fears no news, How bade so e're they be.8 Fix'd is his hart; In God hee trusts; His hart's vpholden still. Hee fears not, til vpon his foes God his desires fullfill. 9 Hee scattred hath, and given the poore. His righteousnes for ay10 Shall last. His horne, in hono? raysd, The wicked shal dismay, Who this shal sie, and greeve, and gnash His teeth, and pine for spite; All whoes desires shall frustrate be, And with him perrisch quite. CXIII. 1 O praise the Lord. Prayse yee who serve The Lord. His name praise yee.2 God's holie name be blest from hence, Furth to eternity.3 From whence the rysing sunne the day Doth cheerfullie renew, Til where his task hee ends, all prayse Vnto his name is due. 4 High is Jehouah, nations all Co?anding by his might. Yea, heauens exceidinglie ar low, Match'd with his glorye's hight.5 Who's lyk vnto the Lord our God, Whose duelling is on high?6 And stoupeth doun, in heauens and earth What acted is, to sie. 7 From dust the low hee lifts. The poore Hee from the dunghill takes,8 And wnto him, with princes, place, (His people's princes,) makes.9 Wnto the barren to keep hous His favor doth afford, Of children made a mother glade. O ever prayse the Lord. CXIV. 1 From Egipt's servitude sett free When Israell way did make, And Jacob's house a people left, A barbarous tonge which spake,2 Judah the Sanctuary wes, Where honored was his name, And Israell the dominion Which him for Lord did claime. 3 The sea this saw and frighted fled; Swift Jordan back did flow.4 Lyk ra?s the mountains high did skip, Lik lambs, the hills more low.5 Sea, wherefore fledst thow? Jordan swift, Why didst thow back ward flow?6 Lyk ra?s why skipt yee, mountains high? Like lambs, yee hills more low? 7 At presence of the Lord, O earth, Submitt thyself and schaike; Whil Jacob's God is looking on, How canst thow then but quaike? O, tremble him before, who turnes The rocks in liquid laiks, And who the veynes of firmest flint, His water conduits maks. CXV. 1 Not wnto ws, Lord, not to ws, To whom belongeth schame, Bot for thy treuth and mercye's sake, Giue glorie to thy name.2 Why should the heathens, in their pryd, Wher's now ther God, demand?3 Our God's in heauen, and brings to passe What pleaseth him co?and. 4 Men's handiwork their idols are, Of silver and of Gold.5 They mouths which speek not haue, and eyes Which nothing can behold:6 To them are ears, yet hear they not, And noses voyd of sent;7 Hands which no feeling haue, and feet On which they never went. 8 No way for words is through there throat. Who make them lyk them bee; Evin all to them, (dishonoring God,) With confidence who flie.9 O Israell, trust thow in the Lord, Whose help and sheeld he is.10 O Hous of Aron, trust in God, The help and sheeld of his. 11 Who feare Him trust in Him; to such A help and sheeld is he.12 Hee hath remembred ws, and sure Wee blest of him shal bee. The house of Israell, yea, the house Of Aron blesse hee shall.13 Evin all who feare his holie name Shal blest be, great and small. 14 To blessing hee shall blessing adde, On yow and on your seed.15 By him yee blest are, earth around Who did heavin's courtain spread. 16 Vnto Jehouah do the heavins, The gloriouse heauens belong; Bot earth his hand devided hath The so?es of men among. 17 The deid that doe in silence duell, Gone doun wnto the grave From mongst the liveing, Thee, O Lord, To prayse no power have.18 Bot wee wncessantlie will blesse And laud thy holie name. From hence forth, and for evir moir, Let all his prayse proclame. CXVI. 1 I'le love the Lord, for Hee My voyce and sute did heare.2 I'le call him whil I live, to me For hee hath still giuen eare.3 Death's sorrows me besett; Hell's payns on me gate hold; Trouble and straits I found till I Did my distresse vnfold. 4 On God's name did I call, My soule, O Lord, sett free.5 Kynde, just and mercifull our God Is, such he prov'd to me.6 The Lord the simple saves; Hee helpt me when brought low.7 Turne to thy rest, my soule, to thee His bountyes largelie flow. 8 Becaus my trembling soule From terrifyeing death, My melting eyes from flowing tears, Thy hand deliuered hath;9 From falling since my feett Thy favour hath sett free, In land of lyff, to walk before The Lord, my cace shal bee. 10 I spake, so I beleev'd. Me trouble sore did try;11 And in my haist, I did affirme That everie man did lye.12 What shall I thee repay, Lord, for thy bounties all?13 The cup of saveing health I'le take And on thy name will call. 14 To God I'le pay my vows, (Now,) in his people's sight.15 Deare in his eyes the death of saincts Is, whom the world doth slight.16 Thy servant, O my God, Thy servant sure am I, Thy handmaid's so?e. When I was fast My bonds thow didst vntye. 17 The sacrifice of thanks I'le offer, Lord; on thee18 I'le call now, in thy people's sight; Perform'd my vows shal be.19 Within thy courts, amidst Thine house them will I pay, In midst of thee Jerusalem. Him prayse yee, now and ay. CXVII. 1 Praise yee Jehovah, nations all; All people laud the Lord;2 For plentifullie towards ws Hee mercy doth afford. Exceeding great his kyndnes is; No time his treuth doth bound. Yee nations, yee, his people all, Loud Halelujahs sound. CXVIII. 1 O praise the Lord, for hee is good; His mercie lasts for ay.2 For ever that his mercie lasts, Let Israell now say3 Still that his mercie lasts, O hous Of Aron, condiscend.4 O, all that fear the Lord, confesse His mercies haue no end. 5 I cald vpon the living Lord, With pinching straits surchairg'd. The Lord his servant dain'd to heare, Me ansuer'd, and enlarg'd.6 The Lord's for me. To me, what man Can do, I will not feare.7 The Lord's for me, with them that help Me, ay in trouble neare. 8 Wpon my haters therfor shall I see, in God to trust Is bettir then put confidence In man, who is but dust.9 Tis bettir in the Lord to trust, On kings then to rely.10 All nations me belay'd, but them I vanquis'd by and by. 11 In name of God I vanquish'd them. They compast me around, They compast me, bot in God's name, Them did I quite confound.12 They compast me about like bees, Bot as a crackling fire Of thorns, in name of God, by me Cut off, they did expire. 13 Thrust at me sore thow hast, to mak Me fall; bot God did ayde;14 God who my strength, my song of joy, Is my salvation made.15 Heard in the tents is, of the just, The voyce of victory; Loud shouts of joy: the Lord's right hand Hath done most valiantlie. 16 Exalted is the Lord's right hand. The right hand of the Lord17 Did valiantlie. I shall not die; His hand did lyff afford. Evin live I shall, and blaize abrode His works which wondrous bee.18 Hee sore me chast'ned, bot to death Did not deliuer me. 19 The gates of righteousnes cast vp, That entrie I may make, And render prayse wnto the Lord, Who me did not foirsake.20 This is the gate of God, by which To passe the saincts are seene.21 I'le prayse thee for thow, answering me, Hast my salvation been. 22 The stone that builders did refuse Is now the corner's head.23 This is of God, this in our eyes Astonishment doth bread.24 This is the day, (O gloriouse day!) For our deliuery made, Made by the Lord. In this rejoyce, In this lett ws be glade. 25 Hosanna! Save now Lord; O, grant Prosperity and peace.26 Blest hee, who in Jehouah's name, Coms frielie offring grace.27 Wee blesse yow from God's housse; evin God, The Lord, our day adorns With light: with cords the offring ty Vnto the altars horns. 28 My God, I'le thee exalt: my God, I'le prayse thee night and day.29 O, prayse the Lord, for hee is good; His mercy lasts for ay. CXIX. Aleph. 1 Blest are the vpright in the way, God's law who leave not. Who observe2 His testimonys, blest are they, With whole heart him who seik and serve.3 Them (sure) no wicked works pervert; His paths they stedfastlie persew.4 Wnto thy precepts, on our part, Thow crav'st, O Lord, obedience due. 5 O, that my wayes (by thee direct) To keep thy statuts, I could frame!6 When all thy precepts I respect, Then shall I not be broght to shame.7 I'le prayse thee with ane vpright hart, Thy judgements just when learn'd I haue.8 I from thy lawes will not depart. O, do not wtterlie me leaue. Beth. 9 The wayes of youth to cleanse, what way? In watching o're them by thy word.10 With whole hart haue I soght thee, stay Me, least thy law I leaue, O Lord.11 Hidd in my hart thy word I haue, Lest si?ing I should thee offend.12 Blest art thow, Lord. Me teach, I craue, Thy statuts, who on thee depend. 13 My lipps, at large, I haue employ'd, The judgments of thy mouth to spread.14 Thy testimonyes way hath joy'd Me, more then goods which most exceed.15 Oft on thy precepts pause I will; Thy wayes in sight I still will sett.16 Joy will I in thy statuts still; Thy word I never will forgett. Gimel. 17 Deall with thy servant bounteouslie, That I may live and keep thy word.18 Myne eyes wnvaill that I may sie The wonders of thy law, O Lord.19 On earth a stranger I: Oh hyde Not from me thy comandements.20 My soule for langour breaks; besyde Thy judgements noght, no time, contents. 21 Thy scharp rebuiks the proud do prove, Accurst, who from thy statuts swerve.22 Contempt and schame from me remove, Thy testimonyes who observe.23 Kings sitt and gainst me speeke with spight, Yet muse I on thy statuts ay.24 Thy testimonyes me delight; Thence counsell doe I craue alway. Daleth. 25 To dust of death my soule draws neare; Giue lyff, according to thy word.26 My wayes I wtter'd, thow gavst eare. Instruct me in thy statuts, Lord.27 Me with thy precepts' paths acquent, So I thy wonders shall proclame.28 For heavinesse my soule doth faint; Give strenth. Thy promise, Lord, I clame. 29 False wayes from me remove. I crave, (Of Grace,) thy law to giue me light.30 The way of treuth I choysen haue, And sett thy judgments in my sight.31 Wnto thy testimonyes ay I stick: from me (Lord) schame avert.32 Of thy commands I'le run the way, When as enlarg'd thow hast my hart. He. 33 Teach me, (O Lord,) thy statuts' way; I shall observe it to the end.34 Giue light: to keep and to obey Thy law, my whole hart I shal bend.35 Me in thy precepts' path preserue, For I all pleasour els decline.36 Thy testimonies to observe, And not to greed, my hart encline. 37 Let not to objects vain, debord Myne eyes; me quicken in the way.38 Firme to thy servant mak thy word, Devoted to thy feare, for ay.39 My shame, much fear'd, put out of sight. Good are thy judgements I confesse.40 Thy law I long for with delight; Me quicken in thy righteousnes. Vau. 41 Thy mercies, evin salvation, Lord, According to thy word, wouchave,42 That ansuer such as me removd, I may; thy word I trusted haue.43 Do not, O do not from my mouth, (Whoes hope thy judgements hath for stay,)44 Tak wtterlie the word of treuth, So I thy law shal keep for ay. 45 So I at libertie shal walk, For I thy precepts seeks. So I46 Shall of thy testimoneys talk, In princes' presence, shame layd by.47 Thy laws, much lov'd, me still shal please; Evin to thy laws which much I lov'd48 I'le lift mine hands; and thy decrees Ne're from my mynde shal be remov'd. Zain. 49 O call to minde to me thy word, To all my hopes which ground doth giue.50 This comfort doth in straits afford; Thy word (O Lord) doth me revive.51 The proud me mock't with much despight, Yet from thy law I did not start.52 Of old the judgements of thy might I did remember, and took hart. 53 Horror on me taks hold, to sie How wicked men thy lawes foirsake.54 In house of pilgrimage, to me Thy statuts did sweet musick make.55 Thy name, O Lord, not in the night Did I forgett. I keipt thy law.56 This had I, cause thy precepts light Me in obedience did draw. Cheth. 57 Lord, thow alone my portion art, I said I would thy words hold fast.58 I soght thy face with all mine hart. Me pitie, as thow promise past.59 My feet I (weighing all my wayes) Did to thy testimonyes turn.60 I hasted, shuneing all delayes; To keep thy precepts I did burne. 61 Me wicked bands haue made their pryse, Bot still thy law I sett in sight.62 To praise thee I'le at midnight rise, For just thy precepts are and right.63 With all that feare thee joyne I will, Who walk within thy precepts' reach.64 Thy mercyes, Lord, the earth do fill. Thy statuts to thy servant teach. Teth. 65 Much favo? hath thy servant found, Lord, such as w? thy word is eavin.66 Graunt judgement good and knowledge sound, For to thy law I trust haue giuen.67 E're I afflicted was astray I went, bot now I keep thy word.68 Thow only good dost good alway, Instruct me in thy statuts, Lord. 69 'Gainst me the proud haue forg'd a lye; Bot with my hart thy law I'le keep.70 Their harts extreamelie fattned bee. To me thy law yeelds pleasour deep.71 'Tis good for me that I sustain'd Thy rods, thy statuts to be taught.72 Siluer and gold, by thousands gain'd, To me besyde thy law is naught. Iod. 73 Thy hands me fashion'd. O, giue light, That I may learn to doe thy will.74 Thy saincts to sie me will delight, Becaus thy word I trusted still.75 I know that right thy judgements bee. Thow justlie me afflicted, Lord.76 Thy kindnes for comforting me, O grant, according to thy word. 77 Shew mercie, Lord, that I may live, Who love thy law. The proud confound,78 Who vexe me who no caus do giue; Thy precepts so my thoughts shall bound.79 Turne wnto me let all that feare Thee, who thy testimonyes know.80 Lord, in thy statuts mak sinceare My hart, least schame I wndergoe. Caph. 81 My soule for thy salvation faints; But I thy promise trust. Myne eyes,82 Fail'd for thy word, weep forth sad playnts; My cares when shall thy comforts ease?83 Thy law I doe not leave, thogh lyk A bottell in the smoake I bee.84 My dayes how long? Thy judgments stryk Against my foes when shal I sie? 85 The proud dig'd pitts to cause me fall, Far from the warrand of thy word.86 Most faithfull are thy precepts all. Persew'd, I, (saikles) am. Help, Lord.87 On earth they me consum'd neare by, Bot from thy laws I did not swerve.88 Of mercy me revive, so I Thy testimonies shal observe. Lamed. 89 In heauen, O Lord, thy word for ay In trueth establisht doth endure90 From age to age. Thy hand did lay Earth's grounds, which stand for ever sure.91 As thow ordain'd, yet all are seene. To thee due service all expresse.92 Vnlesse thy law my joy had been I perisht had in my distresse. 93 Thy laws I never will forgett, For lyfe by them thow hast me brought.94 Thine am I, me in saiftie sett. Thy law sinceerlie I haue sought.95 To ruine me the bad haue beene Lay'd for me; bot thy word I wey.96 I all perfections' end haue seen; Bot wondrous large thy precepts bee. Mem. 97 Thy law how highlie do I prize! On it I meditate all day.98 Thy precepts then my foes more wise Haue made me; they are with me ay.99 My teachers all to me giue place In knowledge, for I ponder still100 Thy statuts. Evin the ancient race Giue way, becaus I do thy will. 101 From wicked wayes refrain'd I haue My feet, that I might keep thy word.102 Thy judgements right I did not leave, For thow my teacher art, O Lord.103 How sweet are to my taist thy words! More sweet then honey to my mouth!104 Wisdome to me thy law affords; Wayes hate I therfor of vntreuth. Nun. 105 Thy word a lampe is to reforme My feet, wnto my paths a light.106 I swore, and will my vow performe, That I wold keep thy judgments right.107 Quicken according to thy treuth, Me, sore afflicted, I beseech.108 The friewill offrings of my mouth Accept; me Lord, thy judgments teach. 109 My soule is alwayes in myne hand, Yet do I not thy law forgett.110 Still in thy precepts paths I stand, Thogh snairs for me the wicked sett.111 Thy treuth mine heritage for ay I hold; this joyfull maks my minde.112 My hart thy statuts to obey, Evin to the end, I have enclin'd. Samech. 113 Vain thoughts to harbour in my hart I hate, bot I thy law do love.114 My hyding place, my shield thow art; Thy word's my trust, noght can me move.115 Hence, O yee wicked, for obey My God I will. Lord, wnderprope116 Me by thy word, that live I may. Let me not blush becaus I hope. 117 Sustaine me, saiffe I shal be, Lord. Thy law shall still be my delight.118 All from thy precepts that debord Trode doun thow hast; vain is their slight.119 Earth's wicked ones thow driv'st away Like drosse; I therfor love thy law.120 My trembling flesch all quaiks for fray. I of thy judgements stand in aw. Ain. 121 Judgement and justice done I haue; Me leave not to oppressing spyte.122 Stand for me, (Lord,) in good, I craue; Let not the proud o'rrun me quite.123 Mine eyes for thy salvation faill, For thy just promise in thy word.124 In mercy with thy servant deall, And teach to me thy statuts, Lord. 125 I am thy servant, giue me light, Thy testimonyes to conceive.126 'Tis tyme for thee to show thy might, For, Lord, thy law made void they haue.127 Thy precepts therfor more then gold, (Gold even of greatest worth,) I pryse;128 Them all, in all things rightly hold, And evrie wrongouse way despise. Pe. 129 Wondrous thy law is, just and right, My soule to keep it much enclined.130 The entrance of thy word gius light, Thence wisdome to the simple shynes.131 With open mouth I longing pant, That me thy precepts may reclaime.132 Look on me, Lord; such mercy grant, As all do fynd that love thy name. 133 My walking in thy word direct; No si?e in me let raigne at all.134 From man's oppression me protect; Thy precepts so observe I shall.135 Thy face mak on thy servant shyne; O, teach to me thy statuts, Lord;136 My ru?ing eyes weep floods of brine, Becaus they from thy lawes debord. Tzaddi. 137 Just art thow, Lord; thy judgement's light Nought blynds. No bryb corrupts thy hands.138 Thy testimonyes all are right; Most faithfull all that thow commands.139 My zeale doth my decay procure, To sie my foes thy word depise.140 Thy word, becaus it is most pure, Thy servant doth most highlie pryse. 141 Despis'd and small [am] I; yet lay I vp the precepts of thy mouth.142 A righteousnes that lasts for ay, Thy righteousnes; thy word's the treuth.143 Trouble and anguisch sore me presse; Yet comfort do thy precepts giue.144 Thy testimonyes righteousnesse Still lasts. Giue light and I shall liue. Koph. 145 With all my heart I cry'd; Lord hear; I from thy statuts shall not swerve.146 I cry'd; to save me, O draw neare; Thy testimonyes I'le observe.147 Night's-clouds e're daylight did disolve, Thee with my cryes I did acquent.148 Thy word's my trust, which to revolve, The watch of night mine eyes prevent! 149 In mercy to my voyce giue eare; Me by thy judgment, Lord, revive.150 They, who for mischeeff hunt, draw neare; Farre from thy law they lewdlie live.151 Neare art thow, Lord; thy precepts true Are all. Of old not to decay152 I of thy testimonyes knew; By thee they foundet wer for ay. Resh. 153 Look on my straits, O sett me free: Thy law is in my thoghts most ryfe.154 Plead thow my caus; deliuer me; According to thy word giue lyfe155 From wicked men is saiftie farre, Who from thy statuts do debord.156 Give lyfe, (for great thy mercies are,) According to thy judgments, Lord. 157 Me manie mightie foes persew, Yet still thy statuts I obey.158 My greeff for the transgressors grew,To sie how from thy law they stray.159 How I thy precepts love, O view! In mercy quicken me, (I pray).160 Thy word's from the beginning true. Thy righteouse judgements last for ay. Shin. 161 Against me (causeles) kings combinde, Bot still my hart thy word doth feare.162 Their joyes, who greatest spoyles do find, Mine, in thy word, do not come neare.163 I hate, yea do abhorre false wayes; But in thy law I do delight.164 Sevin tyms a day thy name I prayse, Becaus thy judgements are most right. 165 Great peace have all, thy law who love; They fall no, nor offence receaue.166 I thy salvation long to prove. Thy precepts, Lord, perform'd I haue.167 I from thy statuts have no swerv'd, In them my soule doth much delight.168 Thy word and precepts I observ'd. Lord, all my wayes ar in thy sight. Tau. 169 Thy presence let my cry come neare; Lord give me wisdome by thy word.170 My sute let in thy sight appeare; Deliuerance promised afford.171 Me, when thy statuts thow hast taught, My lipps thy prayses publish shall.172 My tonge shall with thy word be fraught, For righteous are thy precepts all. 173 Thy law's my choise; to help me giue Thy hand. For thy salvation (Lord)174 I long. Thy law's my joy. Let live My soule thy praises to record.175 Me let thy judgments aide. Astray, Much lyk a lost sheep, gone I haue.176 O, seek and sett me in the way, Thy law thy servant shall not leave. CXX. 1 To God, in my distresse, With cryes I did addresse My sute; He favo? shew.2 From lipps enclin'd to ly, From tongs that double bee, My soule, O Lord, rescue. 3 What shall to thee be given, Or retribute that eavin Wnto thy venome wer, O thow deceatfull tonge?4 Sharp arows of the strong, With coals of juniper. 5 Ah woes me! for why, A wearie pilgrime I In Meshech mourneing stray. Ah woes me, so long That Kedar's tents among, A stranger I do stay! 6 My soule hath haunted much, And duelt with such As peace did highlie hate.7 Of peace whil I did speek, And quietnes did seek, Th? streght they vrg'd debate. CXXI. 1 I'll lift mine eyes vnto the hills, Whence alwayes I haue ayde.2 My aid's of God who made the heavens, Who earth's foundations layd.3 Thy foot hee will not suffer slide; Thy keeper never sleeps.4 Lo, neither sleeps nor slumbers hee Secure who Israel keeps. 5 God at thy right hand is thy shade, And saues thee by his might.6 The sune by day tyme shal no smite Thee, nor the moone by night.7 No ill shal harme thee. Hee thy soule Shal saue. Both in and out8 As thow makst way, from hence forth still, He guaird thee shal about. CXXII. 1 I joy'd when to the hous of God We'l go, to me they said.2 Jerusalem, within thy gates, Our feet thy courts shal tread.3 Thow built art, O Jerusalem, As comlie citties be, Whose pairts, compactlie all contriv'd, Togither do aggree. 4 Thither the Tribs, Jehouah's tribs, To prayse his name repair. To Israel's glory they go vp, The testimonie there.5 For throns for judgement there, the throns Of David's House are sett.6 Pray for her peace: Jerusalem, Much good thy lovers gett. 7 Tranquilitie and wealfare haue They. Peace be in thy fort; Prosperitie thy palices May fill above report.8 O peace be in thee, for my mates' And brethrens' sake I'le say;9 And, for the House of God our Lord, Thy good I'le wish alway. CXXIII. 1 To thee whose throne is Heavin, O Lord, I lift mine eyes to thee.2 Lo, as vpon his maister's hand Fixt is the servant's eye, Their mistresse' hand as wayting maids Obserue, so wee remaine; So looke and longe we for the Lord, Till mercy wee obtaine. 3 Haue mercy on ws, Lord, we still Thy mercy will entreat. Contempt ws fills; the measure, Lord, Thow siest exceiding great.4 Exceidinglie our souls ar fild With scorning, with disdain; Thus they who at their ease do live, The proud, ws entertaine. CXXIV. 1 Had not the Lord (may Israel now say)2 Been with ws; Had not God for ws made way, When men enrag'd arose, and 'gainst ws came,3 Ws swallow'd wp aliue how soone had they, Whil as ther furie in the heat did flame? 4 The streame had swept ws hence, the rageing floode Gone over had our soules; in vain withstoode,5 The waters proud had sweld our soules above.6 But for ther teeth the Lord did not think good Ws to mak prey. Wee blesse him for his love. 7 Evin as a bird from craftie fowler's snare, Our trembling soule escapt, not by our care. The snare is brocken and we ar sett free.8 Helpt in the high Jehouah's name wee are, Who made the heavins and earth; ws helped hee. CXXV. Evin as Mount Sion, which vnmov'd For euer doth abide Shal they be, in the Lord who trust. Evin as on everie side Thy cittie, O Jerusalem, The mountains rise around, Both now and ever so the Lord About his oune is found. For that the rod of wicked men Wpon the lote should stay Of those that are his vpright ones, The Lord will not giue way. Hee will not let them suffer stil, Lest (tempted to transgresse), They in impatience put forth Their hands in wickednesse. Do good, Lord, to the good, to all That vpright are in heart. But as for those, by paths perverse, That doe from the depart, With them that work iniquity They shal be led away. Thow, Lord, wilt lead them, but thy peace On Israel shal be ay. CXXVI. When God did the captiuitie Of Sion turne again, As those that dreameing are, in doubt, Amaiz'd we did remain. Then fild with laughter wer our mouths, (With mirth which thence did spring); Our tongs wnwsuall joy exprest, And cheerfullie did sing. The Lord hath great things for them done, Then heathens mongst them say'd. Great things indeed for ws hee did, How can we be bot glade? Tourne, Lord, the remnant tourne again, Which yet in bondage bide Of our captivitie, as streames Which in the south do slide. Who sow in sorow and in tears, Shal reape againe in joy. The man that mourneing hath gone forth In anguish and annoy, And to the field his sowing seed In heavinesse did beare, Hath (charg'd with shaves) come singing home, And quicklie chang'd his cheare. CXXVII. Wnles that builded from above, By God, the house arise, To toyle and labour all in vain The builders enterprise. In vain the carefull watchman wakes, And slumber doth foirsake, The cittie in his custody Wnlesse the Lord do take. The ayrelie morning yee prevent, And leave your rest in vain. In going late to bed at night But wearynesse yee gain. In vain affliction's bread yee eate, While carking cares yow greeve. Swre, quietlie, to sleep, the Lord To his belov'd shal giue. Lo, children ane inheritance, Gifts are of God's free love; Fruicts of the wombe for a reward He sendeth from aboue. As arows in a strong man's hand Serve to repell offence, The sons of youth for fathers are A naturall defence. Whose quaver fild with such is, sure, His happines is great. They shall not be ashamed, the foe To speek within the gate. CXXVIII. Blest is the man who fears the Lord, And walketh in his wayes. Fed by the labour of thine hands, Blest shall thow be alwayes. Weel shal it with thee fare; thy wife Like to a vine shal be, In shelter of thy howsses side, Which bears aboundantlie. Like olive plants thy young ones stand About thy table shall. Lo, surelie, who do feare the Lord Thus blest shall they be all. The Lord from Sion shall the blesse, Evin vnto thee shal giue The weelfare of Jerusalem To sie whil thow dost live; Thy children's children from thy loynes, A long continowing race; Yea, wpon Israell to sie Prosperitie and peace. CXXIX. Much haue they vex'd me from my youth, (May Israel now say), Much haue they vex'd me from my youth, Yet have prevail'd no way. The plowars plow'd wpon my back, And long ther furrows drew; But God, who's just, the wicked's cords Did cutt and me rescue. Confounded be they and turn'd back Who Sion hate. Be they As grasse vpon the howsses' top, Ere shott which shirps away; Nor mowar's hand, nor reaper's arme Which fills; nor praying goes Ye passinger, nor in God's name A blessing once bestowes. CXXX. From midst the deepths to thee I cry'd; O Lord, my prayer heare. Wnto the voice of my requeists, Wowchaife a listning eare. Iniquities, Lord, if thow mark, Who in thy sight shal stand? But, (that thow mayst be feard,) is found Forgivenesse at thin hand. I wait for God, my soule doth wait, My hope is in his word. My soule (exceidingly oresett) Much longeth for the Lord. More then the wearie watch to sie The dawning of the day, More then the watch for daylight, longs My soule for God alway. Let Israel's hopes vpon the Lord For euer fixed be; For mercie doth with him abound; Ay gratious is hee. Hee plenteous in redemption is, And Israel from all Her numberlesse iniquities Redeeme hee doubtles shal. CXXXI. Nor haughtie heart, nor loftie look My pryd, O Lord, bewrey. In high and wondrous things who made, I never went their way. O Lord, if I haue not my soule Compos'd and putt to rest, Evin as a babe, from mother's breast That waind is, thow knowes best. My soule is as a weaned child. O Israel, now and ay, Wait patientlie vpon the Lord, And trust in him alway. CXXXII. Dauid, O Lord, and all his deep Afflictions think vpon; How to thee, Lord, hee sware, and vow'd To Jacob's mightie one. In tabernacle of myne howsse Not lodgeing will I take; No, not a bed; mine eyes shal rest, Mine eyelids sleep forsake. Till I a place, a duelling place, For God, the mightie God Of Jacob fynd. At Ephratah Wee hard of it abrode. Wee found it out amidst the fields, Wheir gloomie woods do grow. Wnto his tabernacle streight To Worschip wee will goe. Wee at his footstooll will fall doun. Rise, Lord, vnto thy rest; Thow and thy arke, in which thy strength And might is manifest. To cloath thy preists let righteousnes, O Lord, the rayment bee. Let all thy saincts exult and shout, And still rejoyce in thee. Lord, wnto Dauid haue respect; Thy servant think wpon. O, do not turne away the face Of thy anointed one. The Lord in treuth to David swore, And at his word will byd. Vpon thy throne to sitt, a seed I'le from thy loyns provide. So thine my [word] and law observe, Which I to them shal teach, In their succession on thy throne Shal never be a breach. For God hath Sion chuis'd, evin lykd To duell in. Heer for ay I'le rest. The duelling Sion is, Where I delight to stay. Her foode aboundantlie I'le blesse, And fill her poore with bread. Her preists I'le with salvation cloath. The joyes I'le make exceed Of all her saincts. Thair David's horne To budde and grow in might I'le make. For my anoynted one Prepaird I haue a light. His foes with foule disgrace I'le cloath; Shame shall their garment bee. But floorish shall wpon himself His croun in honor high. CXXXIII. Behold, for brethren to abide In vnitie and not devide, What Good, what successe to redound, What pleasour in this peace is found! Tis lyk that ointment excellent, Pourd on the head, incontinent; The beard, which Aron's beard bedew'd, And thence his garments' skirts persew'd: Or like the deaw which heauen destills On Hermon, or on Sion hills; For there the blessing doth the Lord Evin life for evirmore afford. CXXXIV. Behold, yee who do stand by night Within the house, and in the sight Of God; Yee servants all of his His holy name for ever blesse, In holinesse, with hands on hie Lift'd vp, still blessing God be yee. The Lord from Sion blesse thee, made By whom wer heavens, wer earth's grounds lay'd. CXXXV. 1 Sing halelujah! Laud aloud Jehouah's holy name.2 O yee his servants, in his house Who stand, his prayse proclame.3 Yee in his howsses courts who stand, Hymns to the highest raise; For good our God is; to his name 'Tis pleasant to giue prayse. 4 Of Jacob, for himself made choise Of Israell hath hee, His treasure, his peculiar flock And heritage to bee.5 That great our God's all gods above, To me is manifest;6 In heavens, in earth and in the deeps, Who doth what lyks him best. 7 Hee from earth's ends doth cause the clouds Wnsensible ascend, With which, in raine again resolv'd, He lightnings forth doth send. Hee tempests from his treasures Of rageing winds doth call.8 His mightie hand, from man to beast, Smote Egipt's first-borne all. 9 Midst thee, hee signes and wonders O Egypt, on thy king10 And all his traine; He nations great Did to destruction bring.11 Mongst mightie kings hee Sihon slew, Whom Amorits obey'd, With Ogh, who over Bashan bounds The regall scepter swey'd, 12 With Canaan's kingdomes all. Their land For Israel declaird Ane heritage, by lote and line, Hee 'mongst his people shaird.13 Thy name, O Lord, endures for ay, And thy memoriall From generation remain To generation shall. 14 For judge his people will the Lord, And (vnto mercie bent) Concerning those that him do serve, Hee will himself repent.15 Men's works the heathen's idols are, Of silver and of gold.16 A mouth yet speek not, eyes they haue, Yet nothing can behold. 17 To them are ears, are mouths, yet heare, Yet breath they not at all;18 Such are their forgers, such who trust Or do before them fall.19 O House of Israell, blesse the Lord: O Aron's House him blesse:20 O House of Levi, blesse the Lord; Who feare the Lord him blesse. CXXXVI. 1 To God, who's good alwayes,2 The God os Gods give praise;3 The Lord of Lords, strange things4 To passe alone who brings. His prayse display, Whose mercys great Admitt no date, Bot last for ay. 5 Whose wisdome wondrouse proves; The heavins which made and moves;6 The earth, which deeps do bound; Who deeps above did found; His praise display, Whose mercys great Admitt no date, Bot last for ay. 7 Him praise, whose word devyne Heavin's greater lights made shyne;8 The su?e to guyd the day;9 The moone and stars which stray Night's reull to beare; Whose mercys great Outlast all date, And ay appeare. 10 His praises O persew, Who Egypt's first borne slew11 With mighty hand, with arme12 Outstreacht, who (safe from harme) Made Israell way; Whose mercys great Admitt no date, But last for ay; 13 Who did the wavs devyde,14 And Israell through did guyde,15 Whil Pharo and his hoast Wer in the Read [Sea] lost. His prayse display, Whoes mercyes great Admitt no date Bot last for ay. 16 Through wildernesses waist Who with his people past;17 Great kings who did subdue,18 Evin famous kings who slew; His praise display, Whose mercyes great Admitt no date Bot last for ay; 19 As Sihon, prince and head, Who Amorites did lead,20 And Ogh who, soveraine, Did over Bashan raigne. His praise display, Whose mercyes great Admitt no date Bot last for ay. 21 For a posessioune Who did dispose vpon22 Their lands, evin what they had, His servants Israell made; His praise display For without date His mercys great Endure for ay. 23 Who did not us forgett, Broght low and sore o'rsett;24 But, (whil quit lost we seem'd) Ws from our foes redeem'd. His praise display, For without date His mercys great Endure for ay. 25 O praise him, from whose hand, (As such in need doeth stand) Food to all flesch is given;26 Wnto the God of heaven Give praise allway, For without date His mercys great Endure for ay. CXXXVI. [Another Version.] 1 Praise yea the Lord, all his, For gud and kynd he is. His mercyes, rich and free, Endure eternally.2 The God of Gods O prayse and blesse, Whose mercie lasts for ay to his. 3 Praise yea the Lord of Lords, Who mercy ay affords;4 Who wonders great (alone) Works, ay to mercy prone;5 Who maid the heavens by wisdome great; Whose boundlesse mercy hath no date. 6 Above proud watter's reach Earth's plains who forth did streach; Whose mercyes, rich and free, Endure eternally.7 Lights fayre and great whose word maid shyne; Whose mercy dayes do not confine. 8 The su?e to reull the day,9 For he hath mercy ay, The moone and stars by night, To governe by ther light, Who did apoynt; for great he is, In mercy infinit to his. 10 Who Egypt's first-borne smote; Whose mercy faileth not;11 And thence maid Israell way, For he hath mercy ay,12 With strenth of hand, with arme streacht out; Whose mercy (ay) his guards about. 13 Who maid the Read Sea stand In heaps on aither hand; For infinit he is In mercy wnto his;14 And caused that through it Israell past, For mercy ay with him doth last. 15 With Pharo, who o'rthrew His proud, persewing crew, To floods and foes made prey; For he hath mercy ay;16 And Israell led through desarts waist, For mercy ay with him doth last. 17 Great kings who did defeat; Whose mercy passeth date; Evin mighty kings did kill;18 For he hath mercy still;19 As Sihon king of Amorits; Whose mercyes date no day compleats. 20 By whome wes foyld and slaine Ogh, Bashan's soveraine. For evir firme and sure, Whose mercys do endure;21 Wpon ther lands who did dispose; For mercy ay to his he schowes. In heritage who gave, (No end whose mercyes have) Their kingdomes, large and wyde, In heritage to byde,22 With Israell, his servant deare; In mercy ay to his found neare. 23 Who us, broght low, did mynde, (To mercy ay enclyn'd) Yea, (when in bondage broght24 By foes), our freedome wroght; For wnto his eternally, Renew'd each day his mercies bee. 25 Who food most freely gives To evry thing that lives; Whose mercies, rich and free, Endure eternally.26 O praise the God of Heavin, to his Who infinit in mercy is. CXXXVII. 1 By Babel thair where streams did slide, Wee sate, yea weept full sore,2 Remembring Sion. Wee our harps Hung vp (for wse no more)3 On willows midst that place, for there They, who (with cruell hand) Ws captivs led, ws spoyld, did songs, Did much of ws demande. Sing of the songs to ws (sayd they) That Sion doth afford.4 How in a strange land shall wee sing Songs due wnto the Lord?5 Of thee, O deare Jerusalem, If I forgettfull prove, My right hand let forgoe, with arte, Wpon the harp to move. 6 My tonge let to my palat cleave, Thy greeves when I neglect; When I wnto Jerusalem My cheifest joy respect.7 To Edom's sonnes remember, Lord, Jerusalem's sad day; Who, rase it, rase it to the ground, (Insultinglie) did say. 8 Thow, Babell's daughtir, to be layd Full low, how happy hee Who thy deservings at our hands Shall render wnto thee.9 O happie they (remembring ws) Who shall thy litle ones Snatch (merciles) from mother's brests, And dash against the stones. CXXXVIII. 1 Thee with my whole hart will I prayse; I'le sing (O God) to thee2 Before the Gods. My worschip shall Respect thy Sanctuary. For thy great mercy, for thy trueth, I'le celebrate, O Lord, Thy name, who all thy name above Hast magnifyd thy word. 3 The very day that I did call, Evin then thow madst reply, And to confirme my fainting soule Thy strenth didst not deny.4 The Lord earth's princes all shall prayse, When they thy words sall heare.5 They in thy wayes shall joy, for great Thy glory doth apeare. 6 Thogh high the Lord bee, yet his eyes Wpon the humble are; On them hee looks with kind respect, And knows the proud afarre.7 Midst straits envolv'd thogh I did walk, Thow, Lord, wilt me revive. Against the rage of foes thy hand, Streacht out, shall me releive. 8 Thy right hand shall my safetie be, To sheild me from their spite. Thow wilt, O Lord, what me concernes Accomplish and perfitt. No dait thy mercie doth admitt, But doth endure for ay. Oh, do no, (Lord) thy handieworke Forsake and putt away. CXXXIX. 1 Thow hast me search'd and knoune, O Lord.2 Whither I sitt or ryse Thow notice takst, thow knowst afarre Hidd in my hart what lyes.3 My pathes, my lying doun thow eyest, And narrow tryall takes. Yea thow, O Lord, to all my wayes Thyself familiar makes. 4 Lord, from my tonge no word doth flow, My minde to manifest, But (lo) thow altogither knowst It, ere it be exprest.5 Thow he?st me in each where; thy hand To me thow forth dost streach;6 Such knowledge wondrous is for me; Farre, far above my reach. 7 Where from thy spirit shall I scaipe? Where from thy presence flee?8 To heaven if I ascend, the heavins Thy habitation bee. Hell if my bed I make, lo there9 Thow art. Iff I should take The morning's wings, aboade beyond The furthest deeps to make, 10 Their also shall thy hand me lead, Thy right hand hold me fast.11 Or if the darknes should me shroude, I did conclude at last, Evin night shall be about me light;12 No darknes hids from thee. Night shines as day; to thee alike Both light and darknes bee. 13 My reyns possest, O Lord, me hidd In mother's wombe thow hast.14 To celebrate thy praise, by me Shal nevir be o'repast. For how thow madst me while I muse, Thence fearfull wonders flow. Thy works (all) admiration breed, This, weell my soule doth know. 15 My firmer substance scaipt thee not, In secreet when forth broght By thee; when in earth's lower pairts I curiouslie was wroght.16 My schaipeles masse thine eyes did view; All written in thy booke My members wer, whil none yet were, In tyme which fashion tooke. 17 To me how dear thy thoghts! Their summe How great! Ther compt to lay18 The sand they should surpasse. Awakt, Lord, I am with thee ay.19 The wicked thow (in end), O God, Assuredly wilt slay. Yee, therfor, that delight in blood, Far, far from me, away! 20 Their wicked projects to promove, Of thee who mention make, And, (foes profest to thee,) in vain Thy name do (feareles) take;21 Such, Lord, thy haters, do I not With hatred deep despise? How highlie am I greev'd with those That dare against thee rise? Such perfytlie I hate, with me For foes sall such be found.22 Search me, O God, and know my hart. Me prove, the secreets sound,23 Hidd in my thoghts. Sie, if in me The wayes of si?e reside;24 And in eternitie's pathway, O Lord, thy servant lead. CXL. 1 Mee from the evill man, from men Who violence do vse, Deliuer and preserve, O Lord;2 In harts who mischeeff muse,3 For war who dayly meet; made scharp Who haue, as serpents sting, Their tongs; from whose envenom'd lips Doth asps' hott poyson spring. 4 Me from the wickeds' hand, O save; Me from the violent Preserve, O God; who, to orthrow My wayes, do wayes invent.5 For me a snair, evin cords the proud Have hid and spredd a nett, Me by the wayside to surpryse; They grins for me have sett. 6 Lord, thow my God art; heare the voyce Of my requeist, I sayd.7 O, God the Lord, my saveing strenth, In day of armes (belay'd By foes) thow coveredst my head.8 Lord, the desires repell, The wickeds' plots let not prevail, Lest they with pryd do swell. 9 The speciall who doth me persew, Them who besett me round, Of ther owne lips the mischeef may Quite cover and confound;10 Vpon them burning coals may fall; In flames let them be throwne; In gulfes from whose vast deeps to rise No regresse back is known. 11 The evill tong'd, not stablish'd, shall From earth be swept away; And evill shall the violent Hunt quickly to decay.12 The cause of the aflicted wight I know thow will mantaine; Yea, (doubtles) thow, O Lord, will right The poore when they complaine. 13 Due prayse the just wnto thy name Assuredly shall give; And wpright ones (by the protect'd) Shall in thy presence live. CXLI. 1 To thee I call, hast wnto me, Lord, to my voyce give eare.2 When I with cryes befor thee come, My prayr let apeare. As savory incense in thy sight, My hands lift'd wp on high, Let as the evining sacrifice Acceptance fynd with thee. 3 Set thow a watch befor my mouth, O Lord, my lipps preserve;4 Their passage guard. Let not my hart To any evill swerve. To practise wickednes with these Who worke iniquity, Or long ther delicats to taste, Let me not taken be. 5 Me let the righteouse smytt, from love So his reprooffe proceid; This will I hold a soveraine balme, Which shall not breke my heid; For in their evills (yet) I'le pray.6 Ther judges reull who beare, In stony pairts thrown doun, my words (Which sweet ar) then shall heare. 7 Evin as when one doth ti?ber cutt, Or cleave wpon the ground, About the graves mouth (heir and their), Or bones ar scattred found.8 Bot on thee, O my God and Lord, Myne eyes I fixed have; In the my trust is; destitute My soule, O doe not leave. 9 From trains laid for me, from their snaires That work iniquity10 Me save. The wickeds' netts themselvs Let fange, whil I passe free. CXLII. Thus David pray'd when in the cave He lurkt, from Saul his lyfe to save. 1 My voyce I lifted to the Lord, I with my voyce did pray.2 To him my plaint I did powre forth, To him my straits display.3 Within me when my sprit faild, My path wes knoune to thee. No way wherin I walkt from snares, From privy plotts wes frie. 4 I to the right hand cast mine eye, And lookt about me round; Bot none wold heid me; no refuge At all wes for me found. My soule to succour none did seik.5 Then did I cry for ayd, Thow, Lord, in land of lyfe my hope, My portion art, I sayd. 6 Wnto my cry enclyne thyne eare, For I full low am broght, Me save; they stronger ar then I, By whom my lyfe is soght.7 To prayse thy name, from prisoun bring My soule; the just shall flow And throng about me when thow shalt To me thy bounty schow. CXLIII. 1 My prayr heare, O Lord, My sute do not deny; Grant, in thy treuth and righteousnes, A gratious reply.2 Lord, with thy servant deall Not as a judge seveire; For in thy sight no living soule Shall justified apeare. 3 O heare, for sore sett on My soule is by my foe; He smitten hath wnto the ground, And broght my lyfe full low; As these by [death] devored, Long since from sight of man, Enforc'd I am myselfe to shroude In darknes' dreirie denn. 4 My sprits weill neire spent, To fainting place have given. My hart within me wondrously Is to amazment dreavin.5 Back to the dayes of old Then streght my thoghts doe ru?. Thy works I muse on, and revowe What earst thy hands have done. 6 Befor the are spread forth My hands. My soule for thee Longs as the thristy land for raine.7 Mak hast to answer me. My sprit faills, O Lord; Doe not withdraw thy face, Of these who to the grave goe doune Lest I the steps do trace. 8 Thy loveing kyndnes cause Me in the morneing heare, For in the doe I trust: The way Mak wnto me apeare, The way which I must keep. I lift my soule to thee.9 From foes me scheild; to thee alone For schelter saife I flee. 10 Teach me, O Lord, thy will By practise to obey. My God thow art, thy Sprit good Let be my guyd allway, Me saifly in the land Of righteousnes to lead.11 Wnto thy servant lyfe restore, I, for thy name's sake, plead. 12 Lord, in thy righteousnes, My soule from straits sett frie; Mine adversaryes overthrow, Of thy benignity. To my distressed soule, Afflictioune who afford, Destructioune on them bring, for I Thy servant am, O Lord. CXLIV. 1 Blest be the Lord, my strength, who taught My hands hath to mak ware; By whom my fingers, 'gainst my foes, To fight instructed ar.2 My gudenes, fort and towre hee is, Me who in straits setts free, My scheild, my trust, Hee who subdues My people vnder me. 3 Lord, what is man, that with respect Or notice him thow dainst? Or what the sone of man, of him That myndfull thow remainst?4 Man lyk to vanity, whose dayes As schadows swift we sie, Which but apeare in passeing by, And gone ar instantly. 5 Thy heavins, O Lord, bow by thy might, And from above discend. The mountains touch and they shall smoak.6 Forth fyre and lightning send, And scatter them; thyne arrows schote7 And them destroy. From high Thy hand let doune; from watters great Red and deliver me. O Saue me from strang children's hands,8 Whose wicked mouths do vent Things false and vaine, whose right hand is A right hand fraudulent.9 A new song, Lord, to thee I'le sing; The psaltory I'le take, And on a ten string'd instrument To thee I'le musick make. 10 The Lord it is alone to kings Who gives the victory. Hee, from the hurtfull sword, doth sett His servant David free.11 O, red and save me from their hand, Whose mouths doe lyes relate; From children strange, whose right hand is A right hand of deceate; 12 That lyk to speady riseing plants, In youth our sonns may bee; Our daughters as fair corner stones, Which cutt ar curiously For raiseing some rair edifice;13 That victualls for our vse, Our garners stuft, in plenty may, Of evry kynd, produce. That thousands in our streets, our flocks, Ten thousands may of yong14 Bring forth; that, labour to endure, Our oxen may be strong; That no irruptioune be at all, No breaking forth from hence; That in our streets no cry be hard Of wrong or violence. 15 Of people, thus with whom it fares, O the exceeding blesse. Of people, O, the happy state, Whose God Jehovah is. CXLV. 1 My God and King I'le the extoll, And blesse thy name for ay.2 I'le blesse thee evry day; thy name I'le prayseing be allway.3 Great is the Lord and worthie prayse; His greatnes search exceeds.4 Race vnto race shall prayse thy works, And schew thy mighty deids. 5 The glory and the honor due Wnto thy Majesty, Thy wondrous works, of my discourse Still shall the subject bee.6 Thy fearefull acts, so full of might, By all shall be exprest; And I indevoir will to mak Thy greatnes manifest. 7 Thy bounty, which doth passe all bounds, Men shall in record bring; And all thy righteousnes alone Shall celebrate and sing.8 Most gratious is the Lord; with him Compassion doth abound. To anger allways slow, and great In mercy he is found. 9 The Lord is gude to all; to all His works extendeth hee10 His tender mercyes. All thy works (Lord) shall give prayse to the. The shall thy sancts, thy servants blesse.11 Thy kingdome's glory gritt They shall sett forth, and of thy power, (Vnlimited) relate; 12 That to the sones of men his acts Of might may be made known, And thus the gloriouse majesty Of his dominione schowne;13 Whose thron a thron eternall is, And whose dominione From generatione shall endure To generatioune. 14 His weak ones, all that fall, the Lord Vpholdeth by the hand; And all that ar bow'd doune, to strenth Restor'd, hee straght maks stand.15 The eyes of all things do look vp, All (Lord) on thee depend; Thow wnto evry one their food Dost in due seasoun sende. 16 Thy hand thow openest, whence to all Thow dost aboundance bring, That satisfyd is the desyre Of evry liveing thing.17 Just is the Lord in all his wayes; He holy is in all18 His works. The Lord to all is neare That doe vpon him call. 19 To all that call on him in treuth, Who feare him, what they crave Hee will acomplisch. When they cry Them he will heare and save.20 In saifty, scheilded by the Lord, Ar all that do him love; Bot all the wicked, quyte cutt off, His wrath's effects shall prove. 21 My mouth the prayses of the Lord Shall publisch and proclaime. And let all flesch for ever blesse And laud his holy name. CXLVI. 1 Praise yea the Lord. Prayse God, my soule. I'll prayse him q?? I live.2 Prayse to my God I'le sing, to me Whill being Hee doth give.3 Trust not in princes, in the sone Of man who can not save.4 His breath goes out, and back to earth He getts, to gett a grave. With him his thoghts (his draughts most deep) Do perisch in y? day.5 O, blest is hee, who for his help Hath Jacob's God allway; Whose hope is in the Lord his God,6 The heavin, the earth, the deeps, And all theirin conteined who maid, [And] treuth for euer keeps. 7 For all benaith oppressione's load Who groan, he judgment gives, And (bountifull) with fitting foode The hungry hart releevs.8 The prissouner the Lord doth louse; The Lord the blind maks sie; The bow'd the Lord doth rayse; the Lord All loves that vpright bee. 9 The Lord the stranger doth preserve, The orphane oft made prey; The widow he releives, bot quyt O'rturnes the wicked's way.10 The Lord, O Sion, even thy God Shall soveraine sitt for ay, And raigne to generatiounes all. His prayse let all display. CXLVII. 1 Praise God, for gude it is to sing Prayse to our God allways; A pleasant exercise it is And comely to give prayse.2 The Lord the builder is, whose hand Jerusalem erects. The Lord it is the scattred ones Of Israel colects. 3 The broken harted he doeth heall; Ther bruises wp he binds.4 The stars he numbereth, and to all Of them a name he finds.5 Great is our God; to his great power Is sett no certaine bound; So deep his wnderstanding is, That it no thoght can sound. 6 The Lord the lowly [raiseth wp], And headlongs doun doth bring7 The wicked to the ground. To him With thankfullnes, O sing;8 Hymnes on the harp wnto our God Sound forth, heavin's face who hyds With moistning clouds, and for the earth (In plenty) raine provids; 9 Who maks the mountaines grasse bring forth; On beasts both great and small Who food bestows; of reavens who heares The yong ones, when they call.10 Nor strenth of horse, nor limbs of men Him joy or pleasure bring;11 His joy who feare him ar, in hope Who on his mercy hing. 12 Jerusalem, O laud the Lord. Sing to thy God a song13 Of prayse, O Sion, for thy gates With barrs he hath made strong. Thy sonnes within the he hath blest.14 Peace, (yeelding pleasures sweet), Hee in thy borders maks, and feeds The with the fatt of wheatt. 15 Forth his co?and on earth he sends; His word doth ru?e w? speed.16 He giveth snow lyk wooll, hayr-frosts Lyk ashs hee doth spread.17 His yce in flakes hee casteth forth Lyk morsells. Who can stand18 Befor his cold? Hee speaks and streght All melt at his co?and. His winds to blow, streames (strangly curvt) Hee causeth to be gone.19 His word to Jacob, his decrees And judgments hee hath schowne20 To Israell; No natioun els Hath so great favour found; For they his judgments haue not knowne. Let all his prayses sound. CXLVIII. 1 O praise the Lord. From heaven His praise do yea proclame. Let prayse on high be given Wnto his holy name.2 Angells of light, Yee hosts of his, Him prayse and blesse Who's great in might. 3 Su?e, moone, yea planets bright, Your maker's glory prayse. Him prayse all stars of light,4 Yea heaven of heavens him praise. Floods, which above Heavins' circles Hee Vpholds, doe yea His prayse promove. 5 Let them exalt the name Of God at his co?and. They what they are became, Created by his hand;6 Yea, stablisht they For ever bee By his decree, Which lasts for ay. 7 From earth O prayse the Lord, Yee dragons, all yee deeps; Yea to fullfill his word, Which still in store he keeps,8 Fyre, haill and snow, Vapoures and winds, Stormes of all kynds Which he maks blow; 9 Yea mountaines and yea hills, Yea trees which fruit doe yeild, Yee which with sapp he fills, Tall cedars of the field,10 Beasts, wild and tame, Each creeping thing And bird of wing, All praise his name. 11 Yea kings who earth co?and; All people prayse the Lord; The princes whom the land To judge he doth afford;12 Youth give the prayse, And virgines all; With children small, Yea full of dayes. 13 Praise to his name present. Him laud let evry one, For high and excellent The Lord's name is alone. His glorye's hight The heavins transcends; O'r all earth's ends He reules by night. 14 His mighty hand doth rayse His people's horne on high, Off all his sancts the praise, Evin Israell's progeny, A people neare Wnto the Lord. Prayse, prayse afford, All who him feare. CXLIX. Sing halelujah to the Lord. Sing ane wnvswall song; A new one signe yea of his prayse, Wher sancts togither throng. Let Israell, in his maker, mirth Expresse in hart and voyce; And let the sons of Sion shout, And in ther king rejoyce. The floote, the timbrell and the harp, To celebrat his name Let them employ, &amp; singing psalmes, His prayse aloud procleame. For in his people (to him deare) The Lord doth pleasur tak. He with salvatioune the meek Bewtyfull will mak. In glory let the sancts exult, And mak ther bedds rebound With songs of joy; let in ther mouths The hights of God be found; And in ther hands a tuo edg'd sword, That vengance they may tak On heathens, and to punischments May people subject mak; That they their kings with bonds may bound, And chains upon them lay; With iron fetters that mak fast Ther speciall peeres they may, And on them execute the doome Keept written in record, A honor due to all his sancts. Sing prayse wnto the Lord. CL. Praise yee the Lord. Let all his prayse Sound in his sanctuary. O, praise him in his firmament Of strenth and majesty. Him in his mighty acts extoll. On high his glory rayse. Wnto his greatnes' excellence Proportione yo? prayse. With sound of trumpett, psaltery And harp his prayse procleame. With timbrell, flute &amp; virginell, With organ prayse his name. Him praise with cimballs shrill; him prayse W? cymballs, Lord, which rigne. Let each thing breathing laud the Lord. All Halelujah sing. Solj deo honor et gloria.</field>
